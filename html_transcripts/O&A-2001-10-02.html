<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts introducing themselves and their phone numbers, welcoming in-studio guests Anthony and Jim Norton, and mentioning Jay Moore as a scheduled caller.  Discussion immediately turned to Moore's recent appearances on *Conan O'Brien* and *The Weakest Link*, with speculation surrounding his dismissal from the latter due to inappropriate behavior with a female contestant.  West Coast Dave called in to thank Opie for a winning NFL bet, ironically highlighting Opie's infamous "sports curse" – a seemingly jinxing effect where his team predictions consistently fail. Opie elaborated on this curse, recounting his history of witnessing numerous sports team defeats across various cities he’d resided in. A Philadelphia listener, Bob, called in with a thinly veiled attempt to insult the show by comparing them unfavorably to Howard Stern, which resulted in playful antagonism from Opie and Anthony.  Further calls included Chuck discussing the show's "WOW" promotional campaign in Boston, and Adam offering a sports prediction heavily influenced by Opie's curse. Susan's call about applying the curse to war led to a lengthy discussion about the impending conflict in Afghanistan, filled with humorous speculation about military targets, capabilities, and Taliban vulnerabilities,  including a crude song parody about the Taliban.  The hosts also detailed their upcoming 100th show celebration in Philadelphia – a live broadcast from WYSP studios followed by a live show at the Electric Factory featuring guests Pat Croce and Stephen Lynch.  They discussed a "Naughty Nighty" contest involving women's nightgown photos with Opie and Anthony imagery, and the difficulty in securing an appropriate grand prize.  The planned airing of the "Carol Miller tapes" was delayed until later.  Promotional material for a horror DVD compilation ("Boogeymen") and the upcoming guest appearance of Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger) were mentioned, alongside a preference for intimidating rather than polite celebrity guests.

The focus then shifted to the Carol Miller tapes, alongside listener calls suggesting guests for a Freddy Krueger-themed show, including "Jackie the Knife Girl," a woman aroused by knives being scraped on her body.  The bulk of this segment involved playing and discussing audio clips of past arguments with Carol Miller, a former WNEW DJ.  These heated exchanges covered various contentious points: Opie and Anthony’s use of kazoos over classic rock during a station retrospective, the hosts' perceived lack of seriousness, their belief that Miller's programming was outdated and hurting ratings, and their attempts to get her to resign. The arguments were rife with insults and name-calling, culminating in Miller bringing enemas to the studio.  Anecdotes included a staff meeting where their program director declared the Beatles and Led Zeppelin "irrelevant" and proclaimed Opie and Anthony the station's future, alongside instances of the program director interfering with another DJ’s playlist and other workplace conflicts. The hosts recounted past conflicts with Miller, including a tense studio standoff with their boss attempting mediation, and contrasted their initially low ratings with Miller’s past success.  The segment concluded with discussion of Jay Moore's appearance on *Conan O'Brien*, where he used the catchphrase "yam bag" from another comedian, mirroring Opie and Anthony’s own appropriation of material.  Further discussion included Moore's experiences on *Celebrity Weakest Link*.

The next segment announced the details of their 100th Philadelphia show, a live broadcast and road show at the Electric Factory on October 17th,  encouraging listeners to visit the studio beforehand.  Travis Meeks from Days of the New called in, discussing the band's history, internal conflicts, a Massachusetts gang brawl, and their new album "Red," offering cryptic explanations of its symbolism.  Brian from the opening band Octane also called in to discuss their setlist.  The second half focused on the Friday show featuring Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger), with significant discussion about Jackie, "the knife girl," possibly participating,  whether Englund would appear in character, and acquiring a Krueger glove. A clip of Jackie with a knife was played. Old Dirty Bastard (ODB) called in, discussing a new business venture selling anthrax pills and antibiotics, resulting in a comedic conversation about the market. A caller suggested cutting Jackie's clothes off, but the hosts advised her to seek permission from Ron and Fez.  ODB played a song submission ("USA Holla If You're With Me") for a World Trade Center tribute, which the hosts criticized harshly.  Jay Moore called in again, recounting his *Weakest Link* elimination and an alleged past relationship with a contestant.  The segment concluded with tangents and promotion of the "Naughty Nighty" contest.

Finally, a heated phone call between comedians Dice and Jay Moore dominated the final segment.  Dice recounted a story about a conversation with Alexandra, a blonde contestant from *Weakest Link*, where he made a cutting remark about her marrying George Stephanopoulos for his money, prompting a shocked audience reaction.  A bitter feud between Dice and Moore ensued. Dice accused Moore of stealing jokes, notably a "yambag" bit used on *Conan O'Brien*, and other material,  calling him various names. He criticized Moore's career choices, referencing his role as "the Gilligan of movies," and recounted perceived slights, including Moore's absence from his birthday party and an opportunistic booking at Westbury Music Fair involving canceling a gig with the Rascals. Moore defended himself, offering explanations and denying the accusations.  The hosts attempted to mediate but mainly let the argument play out.  The conversation concluded with an unresolved conflict, an agreement to continue the argument the following day, and a promotion of Moore's upcoming benefit show at the Beacon Theater. A short audio clip from *Conan O'Brien*, featuring Moore’s use of the disputed "yambag" joke, was played.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony show, a couple phone numbers real fast, if you're  in the New York area, 877-692-1027, anywhere else in America, 866-277-4, wow, wait, I don't  have my Neil Diamond karaoke for that. Anywhere else in America, in America, today, my country 
[00:00:30]  tis of thee. Giving out the number, look at that, Neil helping you out. Anthony in the  studio. Of course. Jim Norton in the studio. Where else would I be? Jay Moore calling in  today to talk about his appearance on Conan O'Brien. He also has to talk about The Weakest  Link. He was on for about 30 seconds, I think. I think he got kicked off because he banged  one of the chicks. We'll have to get to the bottom of that today. And let's start the show 
[00:01:00]  with West Coast Dave calling long distance from San Francisco. Dave. Hey, is Opie the Greek  there? What's up, Dave? Hey, Opie, I'd like to thank you personally for the Monday Night  Lock. As soon as I heard you pick the Jets, man, I was on the phone. I appreciate it.  We said it yesterday. We asked Opie who his pick was and he said the Jets, which was indeed  a lock for the 49ers. It was such a lock. Thanks, Opie. Yeah. Later, guys. Let's not forget 
[00:01:30]  also on the show yesterday, I said the Mets thing. It's destiny. Oh, destiny. Yeah, it's  destiny. All right. They're now almost officially out of it. The Mets are my density. People don't  really understand the sports curse fully. It's amazing. For like the new cities, you  guys got to understand how bad the sports curse is. If Opie picks something, you bet against  what he picks. You will win consistently. The first week of the NFL season, every team 
[00:02:00]  that were syndicated in, every city that were syndicated in, their team lost or did not cover  the spread. I think the Niners were the only ones that won but didn't cover the spread. Right. It  is very strange, the sports curse. Who was the final last square last night? Oh, Niners. What was  the final? 1917, right? Wow. Yeah. So there you have it. Yep. There it is. I mean, the curse. The new  cities are just starting to get to know the sports curse. Let me go a little further with this sports 
[00:02:30]  curse. It's consistent. It was reminded. I was talking to some people about this. Anthony. Yeah. It's  a well-known fact that I spent four, actually three years in Buffalo. Yes, you did. Three  years in Buffalo, four football seasons. Would anyone like to guess which four seasons that  they were? Would it have been the ones that they blew the Super Bowl? Exactly. Thank you. I lived  there for all four Super Bowl losses. Were you there for the Norwood kick? Yes, I was. Beautiful. 
[00:03:00]  Working for a fine little station called the Fox. Wonderful. Which is no longer broadcasting.  Aw. And then I moved to Long Island to root on my Islanders. Yeah, what happened there? Ouch.  And then you and I moved to Boston. Mm-hmm. Let's not forget 1997, the Patriots. The Pats,  yes. Losing the Super Bowl. Losing the Super Bowl. Oh my God. That's right. So then we moved 
[00:03:30]  from Boston to New York. Mm-hmm. Guess who lost the Super Bowl? Holy jeez. You are a total  jinx. Giants lost the Super Bowl. That's right. This sports curse is really starting to freak  me out. Okay? It is really creepy. I can't believe that. Wow. When you look at it like  that. Oh, we could talk more, I'm sure. I'm sure. Well, last year I was running for the  Mets in the World Series. Yeah. You are awful. I was hoping for another $1,000 bet with Jim 
[00:04:00]  Brewer this year, but doesn't look like the Mets are going to be able to squeak this one  out. Huge Knick fan with Patrick Ewing at center. Mm-hmm. It goes on and on. It really  does. It's really scary. All right. Let's see what Philly's doing today. Hey, Bob, what's  going on? Hey, not much, man. How you doing? Pretty good. Hey, listen, I'm calling from 
[00:04:30]  Philly. I've been listening to you guys since the day you came on. You know we're getting  down there for the 100th show, right? Yeah, well, you know. I think we're announcing details  in about 15 minutes, so. Yeah, well, you know, like I listen to the station, you know,  and the station has another personality on in the morning. You know, I don't want to  name any names. Howard. Yeah. Okay. And, you know, I can't figure out why they keep saying  that you guys are copying him. I mean, it's a totally different show. We're not saying  it. Are you saying it? Well, no, I just hear it all the time. You know, I hear somebody complains 
[00:05:00]  a lot. I don't know. You know, I forget who. Bob, no one has complained and said that on  our airwaves in a very long time. So, are you trying to cause trouble or are you getting  to a point? Oh, no, no, no. I'm getting to the point. The thing is that the shows are  so different because Howard shows a comedy show. Oh, see, there you go. Bob, man, there  you go. I've been waiting. I waited 100 days, dude. Bob. And you haven't said anything funny  yet. Now, I mean, you know, a couple of guys have been funny. Bob, Bob, you've been listening 
[00:05:30]  since we got on in Philly? Yeah, really. So, you must be liking something if you're continuing  to listen. And like it, just don't listen. Yeah, that's the point. I'm stuck on there.  I'm like waiting to see what you'll say next. When I don't like a radio show, it takes me  a couple hours before I'm moving on. You've got to realize this is Philly, man. You know,  it's like the cultural desert. Well, Bob, I'm going to give you an A for effort for trying  to, you know. That's good. You tried to ease your way into getting an insult in, which  was pretty good. It was pretty bad, though, Bob. Let's face back. Yeah, well, you know, I'm not 
[00:06:00]  very bright, you know, but eventually I do. And when we come to Philly and go to the electric  factory and you see a couple thousand people there, you know, then you tell us if we're  making an impression in Philly or not, okay? Okay, man. Thank you, Bob. There goes our  newest friend, Bob, from Philly. I knew he was up to something. Of course. You could hear  it in their voice. You could hear it. Chuck, what's going on? Not too much. What's going on  yourselves? What do you got? I'm just looking to get back into some normalcy up here in 
[00:06:30]  Boston. And I went and got my big bus sign, WOW, from the T. Yeah. And so I'll be driving  up and down Route 1 looking for some WOWs underneath my gigantic flag. Oh, cool. Very cool. I was  up in Massachusetts this past weekend. I couldn't believe how many WOW signs I was seeing on the  back of the car. So thanks. They're everywhere. Thanks for the support. BCN's doing a WOW  sticker stop tomorrow, I believe. And they're going to be handing out all those bus signs 
[00:07:00]  that we're not allowed to put on the buses. I already got mine. You could get a huge, huge  WOW sign tomorrow. I got one. It takes up my whole tailgate on my truck. Nice. And we're  hoping a lot of people show up. It's going to be at Newberry Comics in Boston in Braintree  area. Oh, that's cool. In Braintree. Oh, my God. We did a CD signing there. Yes, we did.  All right. So tomorrow they're going to be handing out all sorts of stuff at that Newberry Comics  in Braintree, including the huge WOW bus signs that everyone wants to get their hands on.  All right? Excellent. All right, Chuck. Thank you. Take it easy, man. Bye. Bye. All right. 
[00:07:30]  Let's move on to Adam. Adam, what's going on? Hey, it's fun. Oh, if I need a big bet today  on Braves-Phillies, I want to know who's going to win. See? And explain. What? Braves-Phillies?  Braves-Phillies tonight. Baseball. See, the sports curse isn't about me just picking teams  and then never picking teams. Yeah, but you're in Philadelphia now. I know, but you know,  this shows a lot about honesty. I really don't care about the Phillies or the Braves.  Okay. Who do you think is going to win? Just honestly, right now, if you think, who do you 
[00:08:00]  think is going to win that game? Braves-Phillies. The faithful listeners understand, though.  It has to come from the heart. Yeah. I mean, if you want me just to say somebody, I'd say the Braves.  Yeah, just tell us. No, not just say it to try to swing it the other way. No. Who do you  honestly think is going to win? The Braves. All right. Phillies, just pack it. It's not  going to work. I'm telling you. No, Opie, don't sell yourself joy. It's not going to work. It'll  work. It's not going to work. You know what I think part of it is, too? If you ask him the  question, what team does he hate more, he'll probably say the Braves. Yeah. So there could 
[00:08:30]  be something like that. I don't know. Rick makes a good point. I hate the Braves. But if you're  asking me who's going to win, I would say the Braves. I can't stand the Braves. You've got to  take the Braves because the show is syndicated to Philly. It's got to be games that I care  about, though. And no, the sports curse doesn't work when it comes to war. Thank God. Someone  asked. Oh, wait. I'll let Susan ask. Susan, what's going on? Hi, guys. I just want to  say I love you. I'm from Jersey, but I'm up here in Boston now temporarily. Oh, thank 
[00:09:00]  you. And I was so happy. Wait, really quickly. One day I had a terrible day at work. I was  very sad, and I was searching for you guys, found you, and made my day. But I was just wondering  if your curse pertains to war, because if that's the case, I think you should vote for  the Afghans to win, and maybe the U.S. will come out in the long run. Yeah. Thank God  the sports curse has nothing to do with wars. Oh, thank God. And you know what? Just in  case it might, I'm not saying a word right now. Please don't, because I'll kill you.  My brother's a Marine. He's only 21. All right. Well, God bless him, man. Thanks. All  right, Susan. You guys rock. Bye. Thank you. Bye. Yeah, I'm thinking some action's going to start 
[00:09:30]  up pretty soon, though. I'm still thinking by tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yeah. I'm thinking by tomorrow. We're going  to start seeing something. I hope. But what are we going to see? We're going to see. See,  the more and more I do my research, man. Yeah. What? The Afghanistan people, they are miserable.  They don't like their government. Right. And their government will be destroyed and eliminated  and put in place will be someone that we can get along with. Okay. That's what I'd like  to see. That's what is going to happen there. The Taliban will be gone. We'll be gone. They 
[00:10:00]  don't have much anyway. They've been fighting this alliance for quite some time here. The  Northern Alliance is going to help us out. And you know what, though? They have crap,  the Northern Alliance. They got old crap. And they're doing a job of fighting the Taliban.  They're having trouble with the Northern Alliance. Just wait. Just wait till we go over there.  Everyone keeps bringing up the Soviets problem in Afghanistan. Afghanistan was pretty formidable 
[00:10:30]  back then. You know what I mean? And the government that was in place there really wasn't a fan  of the Soviets. And the guerrillas that were out there, they were very large numbers. And  they were supported by us. So they had a lot of good weapons from us. Now it's a different  story. They got old crap. And they're people, they're kidnapping people now to put them in  the army so they could fight the Americans, they say. Which really gets morale up and 
[00:11:00]  really gets the spirit up that they want to fight. So I think we take them out. Their  government's gone. Then we have a government in place that we support, that we can then  give food to so they can distribute it to their people who then love America. There you go.  Win their hearts and minds. That old gag. That old gag. But that'll take care of that  problem. And then Bin Laden's not going to be able to just hang out in Afghanistan because 
[00:11:30]  he's not going to have the government support. Well, what's the reward? I read a great article  on this whole mess. And they said, you got to start with Bin Laden and you got to end  with Iraq. Iraq will be involved in this and we will destroy that government. And you will  see Saddam Hussein either dead or exiled and powerless. Thank you. Hallelujah. Because some  poor person, I think there's a $35 million reward for this guy. Once you start getting  things rolling, somebody will want to chop his head off. That's what it's all about.  It's all about the cash. These people see millions of dollars available. They start giving information. 
[00:12:00]  They're getting some money. They actually, they don't even have to turn them over. They  give some good information that finally gets this guy. They'll be in for a piece of the  pie. Everyone's got a price. Even these scumbags over there in the Taliban. A lot of those  people don't even want to be involved with the Taliban. They've got no choice or else  they're going to get their throats slit. And that doesn't make for a good, strong,  loyal army. So when do we strike? Tomorrow? I think tomorrow. I'm thinking tomorrow, if 
[00:12:30]  not, got to be by the end of the week. Because now it's really getting short. Blair from England  now is saying, hey, this is it, guys. Excuse me. Either you turn them over. And not just Bin  Laden. They want everyone from his organization turned over. The terrorist camps in Afghanistan  destroyed. And they're not going to do it. So we're going to kick some ass off. And where  does the first bomb land? I think the first bombing, you'll see whatever military installations  in Kabul. Or do they go to the mountains? They're going to be a few. They're going to 
[00:13:00]  be Kabul and some of their military installations that the Taliban have there. And the terrorist  camps that are around out in the mountains. And then who else knows? Who knows where else?  But they're going to take out what makes the Taliban a government, which isn't much right  now. Their whole military, their strong arm, is a bunch of Jeeps with machine guns on them.  Toyota pickup trucks. Yeah, Toyota pickups. That's like their army. So, Toyota.  Dude, they go on parade. They show them like parade, hanging off like a 4x4. 
[00:13:30]  And their own machine guns. And they don't understand.  Do they show the Taliban jumping up in the air, kicking their feet with their automatic weapon  in their hand? You know what the funniest part is? You know what the hysterical friggin'  part is? They won't even know what hit them. There will be either Apache helicopters or tanks  that we drop in the area that can target these pickup trucks without them even seeing it.  All of a sudden, they're just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, in the  back of the pickup truck. Boom. And then you're vaporized. 
[00:14:00]  That's like goodbye. Goodbye. So, I'm looking forward to that portion of the program.  Yeah. I don't think it's going to happen that soon, though. You don't think so?  No. I really don't. You know why I'm thinking it. You know why I'm thinking? Because now  the Prime Minister of England there is really starting to say, hey, here it is. This is  it. You guys, you cooperate. There's no negotiating or it's coming down.  Well, they have a lot of their, what are they, SAS or the British? 
[00:14:30]  Yes, yes, of course. The SAS, yes, yes. They have plenty of time to stop for tea, too, in  the beginning. Every afternoon, no matter where they are, they stop and have some tea,  don't you know? The English. Look, James Bond, those guys. Yeah, they got them in there  with some of our commandos. They've been doing some recon, looking at what camps we're going  to be bombing and stuff. And then we have our spy planes and drones that have been over  the area for quite some time. Q. Yes, James, this is wonderful. You can hide your weapons 
[00:15:00]  in this roll of toilet paper. They'll never touch it. And look at this, a grenade disguised  as a bar of soap. You don't ever have to worry about them taking it from you, James. It's  the animals, James. That's wonderful, Q. If I'm tired, can I sit down? 
[00:15:30]  Whatever did you say, James? I want to be able to sit down. Oh, sit down. That's what I  said, stupid. Pull up a chair and just sit down. It's wonderful. James! I'll take famous  horse semen. Horseman. That was a great bet. Yes, we're prepping it. I think we're prepping 
[00:16:00]  pretty good now. I was the most angry son of a bitch there was because I saw nothing  but talk from our government that we were holding back and looking for some kind of diplomatic  thing that was never going to come. And now I'm starting to see it turn. I completely understand.  I mean, as Americans and being 1.6 miles from ground zero, you know, you wanted our government  to attack immediately because that's what we do usually. Hold on. 1.6. Okay. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah. 1.6 miles. 1.6 miles. You want to just go in there. Right. But the more TV watching  you do and the more reading you do, you understand how complicated this really is. It wasn't even  that. I was upset. I didn't mind the time. I always said this. I didn't mind how much time  went by. No, man. Come on. Dude. At first, you were frustrated, too. You wanted us to just  start bombing. Listen to what I said, though. Pull the tapes because I said this. I go, I don't  care if it takes a while, but I don't want the rhetoric that is being said from the president 
[00:17:00]  and the administration to sound like we're never going to bomb. I want them, you know,  if it's taking three weeks, that's fine. If in that three weeks they're going, man, you  guys are going to get it so bad. When this comes down, you are going to freak out at the  devastation. I'd be like, all right, I can wait. It's going to happen at least. But what  I was getting was the talk, like, bring them to justice, hunt them down, freezing assets,  things like that were upsetting me. Now I'm hearing something else, and I'm feeling it, 
[00:17:30]  that it's going to be soon, and we're going to strike. You know, even though we were joking  about it a little bit when we were talking about the freezing of the assets, I understood  what we were doing. And I had no problem with that, as long as it's hand in hand with some  devastation. Yeah, it was like, oh, come on, freezing assets. How about the bombs? Like the  Taliban cares that assets are frozen. They're broke, disgusting people. The Taliban  can. They just take, you know, and any... Where's that horrible song? Let me tell you  another thing, people that are donating money to the Afghani people. Until that government's 
[00:18:00]  out of there, those Afghani people aren't seeing crap. I've seen this. It happens in Africa  all the time, too. You send all this money for food and whatnot, the government takes the  food and the money, sells it on the black market, pockets the money, the people still  starve. You can't take care of the people until the government's out. You see those stupid  friggin' American missionaries over there? Now they're being held. Yeah. You know something? 
[00:18:30]  They're idiots. You cannot go over there with a government in place that is killing people  for their beliefs and start spreading Christianity, whatever the F they're spreading over there.  They don't want to see it. They hold stadiums full of people to kill people that think like  you. They said they weren't teaching Christianity, though. Oh, what were they doing? Just helping  with the mission. Helping with the... You know, there's no helping those people until the government  is gone. Once it's gone, like I said, we put in our guys, someone we're friendly with, 
[00:19:00]  then we can support those people. They will grow to love America. When they see food with USA  on the side of the box, and that's what they're eating, believe me, they will grow to love us.  Those silly chicks. Brother Joe, what's up? Airborne. You know what? I was listening to you  beforehand talking about the surprise, you know, how they're not going to know what hit them. Yeah.  And as you know, I was 82nd Airborne, and I see, and I've seen what, you know, what the military  does to prepare for something like this. And they end up leapsing tanks, light artillery 
[00:19:30]  and armored vehicles. Drop them right out of the plane. It's amazing. They fly about 75 feet  above the ground, release parachutes from the back, and tanks fall out of the sky. Tanks  out of planes. This is something they don't understand. They think, oh, if tanks are coming,  we'll know when they're coming, because, you know, we got people on our borders and stuff  like that. No, no, it doesn't work that way. Tanks are dropped, and they start shooting 
[00:20:00]  you. Immediately. All of a sudden, you're just sitting, la, la, la, la. Oh, there's tanks  shooting at me. Oh, my God, there's tanks shooting at me. You know what the 82nd's been doing  for the past two, three weeks? You know what they've been doing? They've been boxing up their  stuff. My brother Joe, 82nd Airborne. What were you, 4th of the 68th Armored Battalion?  Very good, man. Joe over here. And he knows about this stuff.  Joe was Airborne. Could you imagine my brother? No. Airborne. Jumped out of airplanes. That's  so strange. That's right. And these guys, I'm telling you, man, they're hardcore, and 
[00:20:30]  they're willing to go. I mean, you know, they're waiting to go. They're constantly waiting  to go. The 82nd Airborne is, it's three, there are basically three divisions. One is  on support, one is on alert at all times. So how many tanks can they drop from the sky?  Hundreds.  From one plane?  Oh, from one plane?  One plane, they can get about six out of a C-130. That's insane.  That is insane.  And they, I mean, hundreds hit the ground at one time, and they're up and ready to go. 
[00:21:00]  I mean, I went through the whole process. They're up and ready to go within minutes. It takes  less than an hour to get those things ready to start firing.  Get this. My brother joins the army, and he's like, it's peacetime. This is great. It's  okay. It's back in, I guess, 1979. It was. He goes, it's peacetime. I'm going to get some  money for school and stuff. He joins the delayed entry program. So he got like, how many months  did you have before you had to actually go in?  I think it was like nine months. It was like nine months. The second he signs up, all of 
[00:21:30]  a sudden, oh my God, Iran has taken hostage. Iran has taken hostage. The Soviet Union invades  Afghanistan. It was like every bad thing happened. Soviet troops massing in Cuba.  Yeah. So all of a sudden, Joe's like, Joe would call and go, we're going on alert. I can't  even tell you what we're doing. He would sit on the runways in these planes, just ready  to go. Wow. With all the gear, loaded weapons. A little compass. I'm sitting on the plane, 
[00:22:00]  and I'm looking, and I'm seeing, you know, we're leaving North Carolina. We're leaving  Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg, and I'm looking, and I'm seeing my compass pointing  south, and I'm like, this is it. We're going to Cuba. They would load bins, huge bins of  live ammo on the plane. They would just load it right in behind. He's a guy that just wanted  to get some money for school. That's the reality of it. A lot of people want to go.  When they are thinking of joining the service, let's be honest here, you think and go, well,  it's pretty peaceful these days. I think I could jump in and get out before anything 
[00:22:30]  happens. Before he even got in, he signed the paper, and they're like, oh my God, look  at this turn of events. Oh my God, the hostages. And there's Joe, what? Wait a minute, I just  wanted to like hang out. I missed Grenada. I missed the invasion on Grenada by a month.  Oh, you would have meant Clint Eastwood. It was my unit, man.  What were you in? 79, 82?  79, 80, 79 to 81.  Oh, you were. 
[00:23:00]  Poor Joe.  It was like a Grenada. When Grenada was invaded, that was like my whole unit. I mean, the guys  that, remember the guys that came up to visit?  Yeah.  And those guys when we were playing with the flares.  That's when they came up with some great military equipment that I blew up my neighborhood  with. It was wonderful. Trip wires, smoke bombs, tank simulators.  They all did timing Grenada. They all went over there for that. When they went to free  up the college down there.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That was nuts, man.  But yeah, they're getting ready. And believe me, man, when the ash hits the fan, it's going 
[00:23:30]  to hit real hard.  Very good.  Real hard. We'll see it.  All right, Joey.  Later, boys.  It's Brother Joe, everyone.  The Airborne Ranger aspect of the whole thing is told by Joe.  We found this really bad parody.  Yeah.  We're just going to play like 30 seconds of it because it gets stuck in everyone's head  and I think that's great. People email us, stop playing that song. It stinks and I  can't get it out of my head.  Which one?  Oh.  Oh.  I hate this one. 
[00:24:00]  Doesn't even make sense.  Taliban.  Ahmed.  Abdul.  Come.  It is time to make the shihan.  Wait, wait.  What is that noise?  I think it's only Americans.  Who can take some towels?  Who can take some towels?  Wrap them around their heads.  Wrap them around their heads.  Harbor some gorillas, thumb their noses at the feds.  The Taliban. 
[00:24:30]  All right.  I can accept that line.  It's catchy.  Yeah.  The Taliban can.  The Taliban can.  Because they like to help in Lod and make the world go boom.  Make the world go boom.  Who can grab Osama?  See, this makes no sense.  Catch him in a sting.  Catch him in a sting.  Slap him into handcuffs.  Beat his ass like Rodney King.  The Taliban.  See that?  Okay.  That makes no sense.  Why?  They could if they wanted to.  They could if they want to. 
[00:25:00]  It makes no sense.  It does make sense, but it's not funny.  But no, it doesn't even make sense.  If they want to.  If they want to.  Could, yeah, do what they just said.  And they could come over here and kiss everybody.  Yeah.  Oh, the Taliban can.  Makes no sense.  She's Osama's pal.  The Taliban can.  Because they like to help in Lod and make the world go boom.  Make the world go boom.  The Taliban hates the United States.  Because they think we're not religious. 
[00:25:30]  And they're jealous of our just.  We may have to blow their boots.  Turn it off.  We better turn it off.  Jersey's God is getting a little upset.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off. 
[00:26:00]  Andy, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Yeah, I just wanted to say, you said yesterday you're going to play the Carol Miller tapes today.  Oh, well, you were supposed to remind me.  Well, I called out.  What the hell?  I forgot.  That's why I asked you guys to remind me.  Hey, I just called in.  I just heard, what the hell is going on here?  All right, we'll take a break.  We'll do the Carol Miller fight from yesterday.  That's right, Ant.  We were supposed to do that right off the bat.  Right.  You said you're ranting again.  Well, you know.  The Taliban can.  I get a little upset.  All right, we'll do the Carol Miller fight thing.  It's really good stuff, actually. 
[00:26:30]  We'll give you the details.  We're coming to Philadelphia for our 100th show.  Philadelphia was the first city that took the syndicated Opie and Anthony show,  and we want to show them some love for that.  Thank you.  Yes, some love.  We got a nice show planned for you guys.  And also, Naughty Nighty.  Naughty Nighty.  Opie's idea when he was watching the leaves change color.  No, it was when I was waiting for a moose to come out of the woods, you idiot.  What?  The Naughty Nighty contest is set and ready to go.  Details next, but if you go to opianathlete.com, 
[00:27:00]  you can kind of check out some of those details, okay?  Right.  All right.  Have you ever seen the people that listen to the show?  Opie and Anthony.  Toothless, drunk, and white trash.  Hi, Naturals.  1027 WNEW.  Bring in your ass back to the greatest city on earth.  It's Ron and Fez with New York Forever.  Check out all the great shows on Broadway.  Right now, they're donating $5 from every ticket sold to the Mayor's Twin Towers Fund.  Fez, you people like the Broadway shows, don't you? 
[00:27:30]  What do you mean, my people?  The, uh, sensitive guys.  Ronnie, you should take your kids to see a fabulous Broadway show.  My kids didn't do anything wrong.  Ronnie, Broadway is back.  We're Ron and Fez for New York Forever on 1027 WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  If you're not in New York, give us a call.  866-277-4WOW. 
[00:28:00]  You're in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Real fast, let's run down the, uh, syndicated show news, Anthony.  You're right.  Boston doing a huge WOW sticker stop tomorrow.  They're going to be handing out those huge WOW cardboard signs that were supposed to be on all the buses and T-stops.  They're not just cardboard signs, right?  Aren't they?  Just stickers, too?  They also had huge WOW stickers made. 
[00:28:30]  When I say huge, I'm hearing, like, two feet by three feet type of huge.  Yeah, you put them, like, like the size of a tailgate on a pickup truck.  So, uh, we're looking for the O&A Army in Boston to go to Newberry Comics and Braintree tomorrow during the show.  I'm sure they'll hand out other stuff as well, so get your ass down there and support the show.  It would be greatly appreciated, okay?  Speaking of Boston, Anthony, Jay from Boston writes,  The Opie sports curse continues with the 49ers win last night.  Well, we've talked about that. 
[00:29:00]  But I also noticed something else worth checking out.  The Boston Red Sox were 64-47 before you guys came back to Boston.  Since then, they're 13-31.  Wow!  I'm telling you, man, this sports curse thing is really freaky.  Opie is a jinx.  All right, so that's going on in Boston tomorrow.  Philadelphia, where is it?  Let's announce this finally, Anthony.  Here it is.  Uh, we're heading down to Philadelphia.  They were the first city to be brave enough to syndicate the radio show. 
[00:29:30]  Mm-hmm.  We're heading toward the 100th show in syndication for Philadelphia.  And we are going to do that live down there in Philly.  We're going to spend the whole day in Philadelphia.  Uh-huh.  We're jumping on a train, uh, what day is it?  October 17th, Wednesday.  Wednesday morning, we're jumping on a train.  We're going to, uh...  They got the bar car on that train, by the way?  Do they got the bar car, Rick?  We're going to bring a cooler or something.  I don't know.  It's one of those super fast trains, so they might not have it.  But you never know.  They probably do if you pay enough money.  We've got to make our own. 
[00:30:00]  Right, Ben?  Trust me.  We're going to have a ball.  We'll make our own bar car on the train.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure they have one, Ant.  Yeah.  I'm sure they have one.  So we're going to leave Wednesday, October 7th from New York City on a train.  We're going to get down there around...  October what?  October...  What did I say?  17th.  You said 7th.  Oh, 17th.  I had way too much coffee, and I can't keep up with my mouth today.  Anyone else notice that?  Wow!  The hell was in that coffee today?  Yeah.  Wednesday, October 17th.  So we'll be down there by 11 o'clock at the station. 
[00:30:30]  Right.  We're going to hang, do some lunch, whatever.  And then we're going to do our radio show live from WYSP Studios in Philadelphia, okay?  That's going to be interesting.  We're going to bring a bunch of local clowns in, you know, like Pat Croce, I'm sure, will  join us, and a few other people known for being, you know, people from Philadelphia.  And we're going to bring our whole crew, the people you know and love, including like  the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Oh, boy.  Just everyone.  Thank God.  Black Earl. 
[00:31:00]  Old Dirty.  Norton.  Old Dirty.  Stephen Lynch.  It's going to be a party, an all-day party.  There you go.  So then we do the radio show for the whole country from YSP's studios.  And then right after the show, Anthony, Wednesday, October 17th, we're going to the Electric Factory,  7th and Willow Street.  Doors open at 7 for a all-out road show.  Nice.  Hoping Anthony style.  And we've upped the ante.  This is the first road show where we have a real band helping us out. 
[00:31:30]  No offense to all the cover bands.  You mean the nerds weren't a real band?  No offense to all the cover bands.  My own band, Rotgut.  Was it a real band helping?  No offense to Rotgut.  It's not like you guys are playing every day, though, Anthony.  Well, this is true.  It's not like you could do the moves you guys used to be able to do.  Well, we haven't tried, but I'm sure we'd kill ourselves trying.  That's the loyalty we have.  When you sing Naked Cowboy, you're not naked anymore, Anthony.  Well, this is true.  All right.  All right.  I'll give you that. 
[00:32:00]  Times have changed.  There was a time you guys did all the moves.  You're hanging from the stage from nooses and stuff.  Well, yeah.  That's why we have time.  Frankly, I think your band calls it in these days.  You think so?  They just kind of call it in.  Yeah.  You know, there was a day you'd puff up your hair into those huge afros.  That's true.  You'd start the show hanging from nooses from the stage.  Yes.  When Naked Cowboy came on, what?  You had a cowboy hat and underwear on.  That was it.  And my boots.  Last time you did it, you had a really nice button-down shirt on. 
[00:32:30]  I don't know what happened.  What was that?  Norton just, like, farted.  Norton, you farted in the middle of my room.  Oh, man.  You're feeling comfortable in the studio, aren't you?  I'm going to need the Vicks under my nose.  All right.  We have simple rules.  Don't fart in the studio.  No crunching in that bathroom.  No crunching in that bathroom that's, like, ten yards from the studio.  Don't smell like that.  So, Anthony.  Yeah.  We're going to have days of the new.  We're going to do our full-out road show, and then when we're done, 
[00:33:00]  instead of saying, hey, here's a crappy cover band.  Uh-huh.  Oh, and they do the Allman Brothers.  Okay, good.  Hey, wait.  Wasn't that us?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You get up there and entertain the crowd.  Anthony, you know.  I was there.  Let me just tell you something.  Whenever our band got up after a gig,  we were there until the wee hours of the morning  with the last people that were there drinking and partying with them 
[00:33:30]  while you were in bed asleep.  So, I don't want to hear it.  I beat the crowd home.  Me, Joe, Calba, Bill.  You guys do a great job.  You know I'm just busting on you, Anthony.  Okay.  Well.  But, I mean, come on.  Days of the new.  Well, of course.  How cool is that?  It's a whole different league.  And we got Travis Meeks calling in today to talk to us about the 100th show.  Oh, yeah?  A lot of people asking how you get tickets.  Well, you got to listen to us on WISP. 
[00:34:00]  They're going to give away all the tickets.  So, most of the place is filled with the Philadelphia listeners.  Okay?  Right.  We'll have some to give away up here in New York.  And I'm sure the hardcore fans from New York will certainly make the road trip as well.  Oh, sure.  It's going to be a ball.  I'm telling you.  Okay?  Who's your band?  Days of the new.  Oh, I didn't remember.  Yeah.  And Jim Norton doesn't really, you're not familiar with Days of the new, are you?  If we make any money.  Play a piece of a Days of the new song for Jim so we know who he is. 
[00:34:30]  You don't know Days of the new?  Grab it now and play one of their hits.  You'll know who it is when you hear it.  Days of the new rocks.  Travis Meeks has one of the best voices in rock today.  You'll know him when you hear him.  Yeah, I probably heard him and just didn't know how to work.  Okay, play a piece of one of their hits.  Play the beginning.  I'll play that one.  He'll know it.  If you don't know this one, then I can't help you much.  Yeah.  But Norton, you're not that sheltered that you don't know like some of the bands that  are around here.  How about that?  Be honest.  Do you remember this?  I'll tell you if I do.  All right. 
[00:35:00]  All right.  Wait till the vocals kick in.  You'll know it.  Sure.  Remember this?  Dead or Alive?  Dead or Alive?  You know this, Jim?  No.  Oh, my God.  This is a huge hit for them.  My name is Ben.  It's not there.  You don't know them?  No, I do.  I don't listen to the radio. 
[00:35:30]  It's not sad that I don't hear it.  You know this one, right?  Another big hit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't know that?  No.  No, I know.  There's a life beyond Sabbath, my friend.  There is not.  There is.  There isn't.  Expand your horizon. 
[00:36:00]  No.  Symptom in the Universe, or I don't want to hear it.  Won't you touch me?  Touch me?  I won't let it go.  Now I stand.  See, I was ready for Neil Diamond today, Anthony.  You actually had it.  Here's that right here.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Where is it?  Oh, you know this one, Rick?  I know some of the ones.  Uh-huh.  I'm waiting for my page to look. 
[00:36:30]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh, where is it?  Oh, oh.  Sorry.  I don't have the words to this.  Ah, disappointing.  There it is.  Oh, there it is.  Hands.  There it is.  Touching hands in America, reaching out. 
[00:37:00]  Touching me and touching you.  Oh, sweet vagina.  Good times never been so good.  Right?  Crackling Rosie, get on board.  Oh, wait a minute.  Forever in blue jeans. 
[00:37:30]  I like Neil Diamond better than when we didn't have the karaoke music.  Neil got confused.  The music is awful.  Isn't that horrible?  Awful synthesizer.  Terrible.  Aw.  Tommy, what's going on?  Anthony, if there's a way you can do four hours a day with Neil Diamond, I swear to you.  I swear to you.  I would listen to it daily.  Daily.  He does Neil Diamond if Neil had Alzheimer's, though.  How good is that?  I think he does.  I like it when he just gets a song and just does it. 
[00:38:00]  Like, not even Neil Diamond's song.  Any song.  Yeah, like he did the Days of the New, right?  And give me a little Guns N' Roses, all right?  Have a good day, guys.  All right.  Guns N' Roses?  All right.  Come on.  I've never heard Neil do Guns N' Roses.  Oh.  Oops.  Ben just wrote me a little note on the sheet that's discussed in the 100th show.  Also appearing at Opie and Anthony's 100th show will be Philadelphia's Own Octane.  And then in big letters, Ben writes, this is a cover band.  Oh, no. 
[00:38:30]  Opie, you always put your foot firmly in your mouth.  Well, I hope Philadelphia, you know, appreciates the O&A humor.  We're just kidding.  We're just joshing around.  We're just joshing.  We're just joshing.  Let me hear you put your hands together. 
[00:39:00]  I'm going to pick one with a nice, long Guns N' Roses intro.  Wow.  I never knew Neil could move like that.  He's doing the whole snake thing.  Let's go with the bandana on.  Welcome to the jungle.  We got fun and games.  We got everything you want in America. 
[00:39:30]  People that you find in America.  We got your knees in America.  Welcome to America.  Knees, knees in your blue jeans.  Moi.  Moi.  Welcome to the jungle.  Crackle and Rosie, get on board.  Give you a whole of Lea, my surprise to me.  Sweet Caroline. 
[00:40:00]  Good times, never so good.  It's awful.  I was having a kneel.  He was singing.  That's awful.  Nice.  Relax, Jim.  I'm not doing it for you.  I'm happy.  Ah, well, of course.  I am Iron Man. 
[00:40:30]  Of course.  Another long intro song.  Look at us wasting radio time.  Girl, you'll be a woman soon.  What is his life that he wants?  That was a plea.  All right.  Calm down, Jim. 
[00:41:00]  Let's go to Isaac.  Isaac, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey, so when you guys come down to Philly, can we come down to the studio and bear gifts for you or something like that?  What's going on?  You know what, Isaac, I'm not supposed to say this on the air, but yes, come down to the W.Y.S.P. studio.  You know why?  Because they set up a little cute luncheon for the O.P. and Anthony show and the salespeople at W.Y.S.P.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  What a bore fest that's going to be.  Oh, boy.  I knew something had to be tied into this. 
[00:41:30]  So, Isaac, if you guys show up at the studio all of a sudden, you know, you're going to save us.  All of a sudden, we'll be like, hey, we can't hang with you anymore.  Look, our listeners are outside.  All right, we've got to go hang with them.  Yeah, sweet.  I'll bring down some cases of beer, maybe some whiskey, a little weed for Stinky.  We'll party up.  We might need a U-Haul truck to bring everything back to New York.  Nice.  All right, guys.  Norton, you rule.  Thanks, buddy.  Isaac, we're completely looking forward to it.  Yes.  We're trying to do some kind of babe-type contest, maybe get girls up there to do a wet T-shirt contest 
[00:42:00]  or maybe a bikini contest where ladies show their patriotism,  because I think we've got someone that's associated with our show that could, you know, give us some red, white, and blue bikinis.  Oh, there you go.  But I was talking to the fine folks in Philly, and they have no money for the winner of the contest.  No?  No money?  No money.  How do we have no money?  We want to, like, get a grand prize of, I don't know, a grand or something for the lady that's, you know, the hottest on that stage at the Electric Factory on October 17th. 
[00:42:30]  Why is Ben shaking his head?  This is how things get done.  You tell them how inept they are, and then all of a sudden they figure it out.  That salesman is going to be fun, though, just to get to know the folks.  Yeah.  Dullards.  Yeah, that's going to be good.  It's high.  Hey, where do you guys get your ideas?  Yeah, thanks.  And then what are we going to say to them?  Hey, I like how you waste a lot of our show time by playing those cute commercials. 
[00:43:00]  Some of those commercials are pretty funny.  Who wrote some?  Oh, yeah, that's great.  Stink.  So that's where we're at.  100th show in Philadelphia.  We're really excited.  Days of New, they're going to help us out.  Philadelphia's own Octane.  It's Wednesday, October 17th at the Electric Factory, 7th and Willow Street.  Doors will open at 7.  But we're going to be there all day long starting around, I don't know, 11 at the WISP studios, okay?  You can't buy tickets.  Listen to WISP starting Monday to score your tickets. 
[00:43:30]  And I think we're going to be passing around hats and stuff to collect money, and we're going to, you know, give money to charity.  All right?  Toy's the sign of a great radio show when you pass a hat.  Passing the hat.  That's good.  We like folding money, please.  Can we open up a guitar case and lay that out, too?  We appreciate the kind that jingles, but we prefer the type that folds.  Nice.  Coming to America.  Yeah.  Norton, I'm surprised you don't want to meet any suits.  You look like a suit type of guy.  Yeah.  Like, you get along with suits.  Yeah, no, hey, how about that paperwork, huh?  We laugh. 
[00:44:00]  It's going to be awful.  Awful.  And I don't want any suits to come see me tonight at Rascals, either.  You whore!  Oh, my God, whore.  Do you have any shame?  I really don't.  Whore!  I have no shame or white blood cells left.  I have to give out the number.  Area code 973-736.  I stink.  2726.  Our listeners do not pay attention to phone numbers.  But you never know.  You're going to have to learn another way to plug your whore gigs. 
[00:44:30]  All right.  But, yeah, all right, well, Rascals.  Terry, Terry, what's up?  Oh, I'd love to be a judge at that bikini contest or a wet t-shirt contest.  People want to be judges.  Well, we need someone to step up and give us the grand prize so we can do this.  Oh, my God, this is pathetic.  How do they not have money for this program?  We gave a good hundred days.  If I had an extra, you could have it.  Gave you a hundred days?  Get us a grand prize.  Come on.  We could raise money.  My wife takes it all.  God, maybe we'll just, you know, we'll pass out a hat outside the WISP studios. 
[00:45:00]  We'll get our own grand prize money.  See, you know, I think people have better things to give to right now.  It kind of seems a little odd that they wouldn't just give us a goddamn grand prize.  No, we're going to get money for the grand prize winner, and we're also going to get money for charity.  Right.  Definitely.  I'll put a hundred.  All right.  How about we...  Sorry, we'll figure it out.  What?  Sorry?  We'll definitely figure it out.  Okay.  All right?  Yep.  All right, bro.  Thanks.  So there are the details for now.  I mean, we'll be adding stuff as we go, okay?  Stephen Lynch is going to be down there. 
[00:45:30]  Hopefully, he's going to do some of his really crazy, goofy songs.  Norton's going to do a set.  Hopefully, we'll get the girls on stage.  Days of New.  It's going to be an all-out party, so can't wait to see everyone.  All right?  I wonder if Neil Diamond could sing with Joe.  Maybe that could happen.  Ooh.  Anyone have any pork chop sideburns Neil could borrow?  Brother Joe's going to be there, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  With all his songs, so it's going to be very, very exciting.  Hell, yeah.  And we haven't forgotten about the other cities. 
[00:46:00]  As soon as we feel a buzz, we'll certainly come to your city as well.  Cleveland's getting close.  Yeah.  Washington, we still have to work on, and we understand that.  That's not an easy one, but we're trying.  Boston's a no-brainer.  Boston's a no-brainer.  Well, they're doing the Wild Sticker Stop tomorrow.  Yeah.  That's softening the beaches, and then we're going to be up there very soon.  Wild Sticker Stop, insane roadshow.  Yeah, that balances out.  Got to start somewhere.  I know.  I don't even know if anyone's listening to us in Boston.  I know.  I really don't know.  We've got to wait and see. 
[00:46:30]  We know we don't have any listeners.  Yeah.  We're gating them every day, hopefully.  It's a new job.  People from all over the country going, can we go to Philly?  Yeah.  If you want, sure.  Go ahead.  Longer road trip for some of you.  Okay.  And then finally, as we finish syndicated news for today, we do have a contest for the whole country.  This is our first internet contest for the whole country.  Naughty.  Naughty.  We're talking about naughty.  Naughty. 
[00:47:00]  Naughty.  Naughty.  Naughty.  Is it naughty-nighty or naughty-nighty?  I like to say naughty.  Naughty-nighty.  Naughty-naughty, you filthy old sumka.  The naughty-nighty contest is on.  God damn on.  Naughty.  Naughty-nighty contest is on.  Naughty.  Naughty-nighty.  Yes, and all the details are up on opieandanthony.com, but basically, ladies, we're looking for  you to take pictures of yourselves in naughty-nighties. 
[00:47:30]  You have to have Opie and Anthony somewhere in the picture so we know it's for this contest.  Right.  None of that Photoshop crap, because we got a guy that's really good, Scott.  Oh, we got programs we run this stuff through, and it shows if something's been altered.  He's not messing around.  I mean, he's really strict, matter of fact.  He's a pain in the ass, so that's what we want.  You and a Naughty-nighty with Opie and Anthony, the really good pictures will be up on probably  opieandanthony.com, and then eventually, all our listeners from all over the country 
[00:48:00]  will vote for their favorite naughty-nighty.  And may I make a request to the ladies for a, if you have a snugger bottom for the bikini,  one that cups very gently.  Oh, you like that.  Beyond comprehension.  And we're still looking for a grand prize for that contest as well.  Oh.  And that is the responsibility of our sales wars here in New York.  But they're pretty good.  They'll come up with something.  Carol Miller?  What?  Oh! 
[00:48:30]  Oh!  Dude, they're going to kill us!  Oh!  The Carol Miller tapes.  We started playing yesterday late in the show.  We ran out of time.  We were going to start the show with it.  And now, look, we're an hour into the program.  Nothing.  We've had some good stuff, though.  Right.  Right?  I've been having some fun.  Oh, you know what?  Sure.  Isaac.  Yo.  What's up, bro?  Yo, hey.  I was wondering if I could get some tickets for the show. 
[00:49:00]  You're the one that just called us, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I forgot to ask you.  I was going to bust on the chick with the book.  I called on her about the sex book.  I talked to her for like five minutes.  I wanted to bust her balls for like ten minutes and then ask for a book at the end of the thing.  But I didn't get around to ask him for one.  Isaac, care.  Hold on.  We're going to give you a pair of tickets to the 100th show in Philly, all right?  Hold on.  That's the first pair of tickets given away right there to our buddy Isaac.  Okay, and can't even say a promise. 
[00:49:30]  No, no.  You know what?  Anthony will be playing the Carol Miller tapes now.  Hey.  Come on.  Don't put it on me.  Well, they don't trust me at this point.  I'll make sure we do it then.  That's what I'm saying.  Anthony is a man of his word.  I'm not a man.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid.  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Theater of the Mindless. 
[00:50:00]  Anthony, we're talking about Boogeymen.  Oh, we got this DVD and it's really, really cool.  Yes, Boogeymen.  For the first time ever, the most terrifying scenes from the scariest movies brought together on one incredible collection.  It's a must-have horror experience.  Features all the monsters and madmen who've scared you in the dark.  Freddy Krueger, Jason, Michael Myers.  That's the Michael Myers from Halloween, not the one from Austin Powers, who's funny.  Well, he could be scary, too.  Chucky, Pinhead, Leatherface, a whole bunch more.  Clive Barker calls Boogeymen an essential collection. 
[00:50:30]  Wes Craven says it's totally insane, an insane horror collection.  Yeah, we have it.  It's all the best parts of these movies.  There you go.  Instead of sitting through all the crap, you're sitting through all the scary parts, all the cool parts of these movies.  It's Boogeymen.  It's perfect for Halloween.  Yeah, if you're a diehard fan or someone who likes an occasional scare, check out Boogeymen.  It's a great purchase, a sick gift.  It's Boogeymen.  It's explicit material.  It must be 18 years or older to purchase.  Available everywhere.  Videos are sold. 
[00:51:00]  Boogeymen.  And Freddy Krueger in studio Friday.  The station for sports guys, Don and Mike, Opie and Anthony, and Ron and Fez is this station.  1027 WNEW, New York.  We announced for the New York audience that Freddy Krueger's coming in Friday, Anthony.  Yes.  Robert England.  No, I hope it's Freddy Krueger.  I think it's going to be Robert England.  You can't have Freddy Krueger. 
[00:51:30]  That's all the makeup and the knives on his hand.  I should go with the extra effort.  You think so?  Why not?  Who wants to talk to Robert Englund?  Englund?  Robert England.  England?  He's done a lot of stuff.  Remember him from V?  Remember his TV show V?  The movie V?  He's coming into the studio because he's Freddy Krueger.  So I want to see Freddy Krueger.  I don't know.  That's why we don't have a lot of...  You were fine when Dwayne Johnson came in here.  No, that's what I was getting to. 
[00:52:00]  Thank you, my friend.  It wasn't The Rock.  I don't like when these guys come on our show and you're excited to see The Rock, let's say.  Uh-huh.  Dwayne Johnson.  Very nice guy.  Quite pleasant.  Well, you know, The Rock says that...  He gets all soft-spoken.  But if you're going to have The Rock on your show, you should have The Rock on your show.  The Rock says I'm going to turn that sideways and stick it up your candy.  He was so soft-spoken.  He's been on our show three or four times now and he's always very soft-spoken.  Because he's Dwayne Johnson.  No, I want The Rock.  You've got to pay for The Rock. 
[00:52:30]  I want him to put the fear in our eyes.  Well, he did do that once.  New York.  New York, I don't remember that.  But if Freddy Krueger is coming in Friday, I want him to put the fear in our eyes.  I don't want the guy to sit there like, yeah, I played Freddy Krueger.  Well, I don't know if you're going to get that.  I'm sorry.  But I think, me, personally, that's fine.  He comes in, Robert England, that's fine.  I'm a big fan.  Yep.  Big fan.  Dave, what's going on?  Gentlemen, how are you?  Pretty good.  Hey, you guys are getting Freddy Krueger in on Friday, hopefully? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  You've got to have Jackie the Knife Girl come in for that show.  Oh, my God.  Best idea of the month right there.  Whoa, man.  Jackie the Knife Girl, a girl that gets really, really turned on by having knives scraped all over her body.  Can we make that happen?  As a matter of fact, we used a Freddy Krueger hand once on her.  Yeah.  If Jackie the Knife Girl is listening right now, or if someone knows Jackie, make sure she calls the show immediately.  We've got to set that up.  It'll be great stuff.  Thank you.  Dave, thanks for the idea, man. 
[00:53:30]  No problem.  You guys suck.  All right.  Peace.  Doug, what's going on?  What's going on?  When you guys take the train down to Philly, is Erg going to make believe he's a train conductor like in The Little Rascals?  You can't keep that dog in there.  Get that dog out of here.  Big and Pete.  Yeah, it's going to be insane.  It's your best friend, Doug.  Hey, buddy.  How you doing, Erl?  Doug from Springfield.  Hi, Doug.  What's up, pal?  What's going on?  You put the funny and unfunny.  What's the matter?  That's not funny.  Hey, that's pretty funny, because you put the unfunny and funny.  No, but Erl, he was kind of funny, though.  Come on.  Can't we all just get along? 
[00:54:00]  Erl, I'm coming down.  I want to definitely have a handshake with you, okay, when I come in?  Man, it's getting scary.  I didn't know how I was going.  What?  What?  I didn't know I was going until you said it on the air.  No, you are going.  No, you have to go, Erl.  You'll have to go.  Who's going to run the cabin and the train?  Why let New York have all the fun when you hit the stage and everyone abuses you?  Why not let Philly do the same thing?  Is the train going to go in slow motion when Erl's in charge, though?  Or is it going to go backwards, buddy?  No, I believe we're going to get there on time.  All right.  Erl will be there, Doug. 
[00:54:30]  Thank you.  Take it easy, bud.  All right.  All right, Anthony, what do you want to do next here?  Let me think.  Let's see.  How about the Carol Miller tapes that we started playing yesterday late in the show?  Ran out of time.  Dan from Rockland on the Instant Feedback.  You could just tell he was pissed when he wrote this Instant Feedback.  Why am I not hearing the Carol Miller tapes?  All right, why don't we set this up?  We ran out of time yesterday, and it was just starting to get good. 
[00:55:00]  We're going to start from the beginning again, Ant, because we weren't too far into this.  Okay.  Just in case people weren't listening yesterday.  And it was very late.  So if you heard the first part of this, don't worry.  We've got a ton of other clips that you haven't heard yet, okay?  Mm-hmm.  So, Ant, if you will, hopefully you can set this up in less than a half hour.  Well, when we first got here, we got off on this tear yesterday because Richard Neer wrote a book about the station that we're at here in New York, WNAW, which was a legendary rock station. 
[00:55:30]  Every city has that legendary rock station that was around forever.  Mm-hmm.  And when we got here, it spelt the end of that legendary rock station, which had just been going down the crapper for many years.  So it wasn't like we came in when it was on top and blew it up.  They were playing the worst of the worst classic rock music.  Yeah.  Their jocks were very, very old.  Classic rock?  Classic jocks, they called it.  When I say very old, most of the jocks were older than my dad.  Yeah.  And my dad's pretty old.  So Carol Miller was one of the jocks. 
[00:56:00]  And we kind of butted heads a few times.  She would do the shift right after us.  So when we were leaving, she would be coming into the studio.  And usually some type of argument would ensue.  So she didn't like what we were doing.  Yeah, because we were there.  She thought it was all about the music here at WDDW.  We were part of the new regime, and she was the old regime.  Yeah.  And she knew that that time was ending.  She truly believed it was about the jocks and the music and talking about the artists.  Right.  And we felt it was just about hanging out and having a good time and, you know, screw it. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  And she didn't think we would do well.  She thought we would be a tremendous failure here at WDDW.  Yeah, she thought we would fail miserably.  All the jocks thought we would fail miserably.  Yeah.  She was the only one that took us on, and I respect her for that.  Yeah.  And everyone else would talk, you know, behind closed doors and behind our backs and stuff.  Remember when our crack PD, Gary Wall, and I call him that not because he's so good, but because he seemed like he was on crack. 
[00:57:00]  Our crack PD.  Jimmy Kimmel's never going to come on our show.  Gary Wall.  We would get into such brawls with Carol that he put down this thing where Carol could not see us in the hallway.  Oh, I forgot about that.  No, that was because of these tapes and these on-air fights we had.  Oh, yeah.  Because of the fights.  Oh, I forgot about this.  So we would get done with our shift at 7 o'clock, and she would come in here to do her shift, which started at 7.  But Gary Wall said she would have to wait in the mail room right off the hallway until she saw us pass by through the little window in the door. 
[00:57:30]  Then she could leave the mail room and walk down to the studio because he didn't want any more fighting going on.  So she would sit in there, and we knew she was in there, so we'd hang out down here, drink beers, wait, wait.  We'd wait.  Sometimes we'd send one guy and leave the other behind.  It's like, all right, if you walk past and I'll hang out here, she'll see one person, but she knows she's not supposed to move until two people walk back. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  And we'd leave her in the mail room.  Yeah.  So we have tapes of some of those little brawls that happened during the crossovers between our show and her show.  All right.  So let's start with the first clip, okay?  This starts with all her coming into the studio during the revolution of rock that we explained yesterday,  where the retrospect of 30 years of rock history, every year was a different year of music they played all day long.  It seemed like every day was another year.  In 30 years, this thing lasted forever. 
[00:58:30]  So, you know, any given day, you'd tune in and go, okay, it's 1972, and they'd play music from 72 and have news clips,  and the jocks would tell about their recollections of 72, and we'd come in and be like, who gives a crap,  and start playing kazoo over the music and singing our own lyrics to some of these classic songs,  and that upset them, too, I think.  All right.  Here we go.  Carol Miller hates us.  Here, come on with your headphones, Carol.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Carol is going to be representative of the people that appreciate this music and this special program, 
[00:59:00]  the Evolution of the Rock of New York, that has been put together here on WNAW.  All right.  So what problem did you have with us yesterday, Carol?  Yeah.  You.  I had a problem with you.  The two of you.  What happened?  What happened?  I'm just kidding.  She didn't like the fact that Anthony was playing the kazoo to all these great classic rock tunes.  I think they needed kazoo.  These cheesy, but old classic rock songs. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  How can we go from a week before we start this special goofing on but old rock,  and then we go into but old rock, and we're supposed to act like we liked it?  Listen, first of all, it's a matter of opinion, but, you know, a lot of this stuff,  including the stuff that you were ranking on yesterday, I mean, I really dig this stuff.  I was playing it for people.  I was there.  Of course, people will dig this stuff.  And you know something?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I dig this stuff, too, when I heard it on NAW, but I don't want to hear it anymore.  I want to move on. 
[01:00:00]  I want to move on to the future.  Yeah, well, I want to hear it.  What do you want to hear?  Third Eye Meatball Blind?  No, I want to hear the latest from the Black Crows.  I want to hear the latest from Kiss.  Yeah.  So?  The latest from the Rolling Stones.  We can't play any of that this week because we have to play Marshall Crenshaw someday,  some way.  Well, I think this is a good trip down, like, a recent memory lane.  We've been doing that for 31 years.  31 years here at NAW.  This has been a classic rock station for many years.  We've been going down memory lane.  You don't know.  Most of these people have every single one of these CDs at home. 
[01:00:30]  If they want to take a trip down memory lane, then they should play it at home.  We used to go talk at home.  Oh, that hurts.  Oh, my God.  You should go talk at home.  Ow.  Hey.  She didn't like us, you know, and she took us on.  And that's okay by me.  So it happened.  It's still an awful comeback by her.  Oh, I know.  It was one of those retarded Laverne Shirley type comebacks.  Take a long walk off a short pier.  We were just getting warmed up, though. 
[01:01:00]  Here we go.  All right.  How many listeners did we gain today by going down memory lane playing Marshall Crenshaw  someday, some night?  Marshall Crenshaw did a really nice Christmas concert for us.  I don't care.  I don't care anymore.  People do.  This is the music that has gotten us to 23rd place.  No, no, no, no.  Yes, it is.  You know what's that?  For God's sake, Carol.  If we played most of this music, we wouldn't be in 23rd place.  Oh, my God.  You're on crack.  Carol.  I'm not on crack.  There's a lot of music.  Are you having a flashback?  Did you do acid back in the 60s? 
[01:01:30]  No.  I wish I did.  Are you having a flashback?  No.  This is not the music that is going to get us into a first place.  Wow.  Look at you.  Anthony S. Kreskin.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  I predicted the future there.  You were being nice.  Our show was in 23rd.  The station was in 28th.  Yeah.  Let's move on to the next clip.  Oh, I got them in front of me.  Okay.  Now, this is us asking her to resign because we knew they were firing all the jocks.  Yeah.  But they were taking their sweet old time, and we figured we'd try to, you know, speed 
[01:02:00]  the process along so we can move on to the future of this radio station.  And we were upset because we were stuck in the quagmire.  We were totally stuck.  We weren't able to do what we want to do in the way we wanted to do it because,  we were surrounded by this kind of stuff and the music we had to play, and it didn't  fit our show, and we were being pulled down by it.  It's funny.  There are people up in Boston that are convinced that we got fired on purpose because we had  this radio station lined up.  Jeez. 
[01:02:30]  Sorry.  They didn't have a clue.  Here we go.  Carol, take all these CDs.  Look at them.  I'm looking at them.  I'll get a U-Haul truck.  Take every single one of these CDs.  Resign.  Take those CDs, and you can play them wherever you want.  And we'll compete and see who ends up in the top 10 first.  Yes.  Oh, yeah, but I'll tell you one thing.  I'm going to make a deal with you.  What?  If I play my CDs for a month, and you yak for a month and play yours, I bet you go down  to 25th.  No, I don't think so.  I don't care.  Oh, no, no.  I would like that bet.  No, listen.  Seriously, guys, I love you guys. 
[01:03:00]  Resign.  Take all the CDs, and trust me, there's so many radio stations in New York, so I won't  pick you up.  I'll tell you all something.  You can take all these CDs and play them and see what happens.  I should trust you.  Yeah, trust me.  Now, why shouldn't you trust me?  Resign on the air right now.  Carol Miller's going to talk.  Oh, kiss my ass, but you'd probably like it.  Come on.  Resign on the air.  No, no, no, no, no.  You resign on the air.  Resign on the air.  We've got to move forward here.  Resign.  Yeah, we are.  Take all these CDs, I'll get the U-Haul truck, and resign right now. 
[01:03:30]  No, I resign myself to hopefully remaining in my seat playing the best rock of the present  past and future that I possibly can.  Is it only a coincidence?  The only people that are enjoying this is Carol, Scotso, and Dave Herman.  I don't know that Dave and...  Go to sleep, crazy lady.  She was convinced we were going to go down to 25th place in the rain.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Couldn't go any lower. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, believe me.  We were bottomed out.  The only stations we were beating are the ones you hear in the cabs.  It's so strange.  You know, in the cab, guys are like, how did they find that station in New York?  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  We were beating those stations.  How did she defend it?  Like, you know, she wanted to keep doing the same exact thing that had the station in  last place.  Yeah.  All of them did.  All of them wanted to sit there, just like they had for many years, play the same music 
[01:04:30]  they had been playing, and the station be in last place.  It wasn't going to, all of a sudden, people go, oh, oh, that station's playing that music  with those jobs?  Oh, let me do it in.  Why did someone tell me?  It would have been that way for years.  Eddie Trunk.  Oh, sorry.  It was Eddie.  Eddie.  Eddie.  Guys, you are giving me the worst flashback nightmare of my life right now.  Some of the best stuff is coming up, because Eddie ran the board for Carol Miller.  These guys were so lazy, and they were here for so long that they didn't even have to 
[01:05:00]  run their boards anymore or do anything.  All they had to do was sit at a mic, and someone like Eddie Trunk, who's a very talented  guy, would point to them, and then that would be their cue to start talking.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, and then someone like Eddie would do all the other work.  If you've ever been inside a radio station, there's a lot to do.  But the jocks, they had the hugest egos.  They didn't have to do anything except get the cue from a guy like Eddie so they could  talk.  You guys, I was trying to call yesterday, too, because I was just, between reading about 
[01:05:30]  that book and what you guys are doing today, I mean, there's just so many flashbacks to  what went on.  I mean, you were talking about being caught in the middle of it.  I was hired a couple months before you guys.  I came from doing morning drive at Q104 to taking over at a board op job, and needless  to say, the veteran DJs that were there at the time.  Wait, wait, wait.  Just so I can appreciate this and chuckle a little harder, you went from doing morning  radio, where you were the man, to being the guy that cued the old jocks here at WNW so 
[01:06:00]  they could talk.  Well, we talked about some of the tactics from our former program director, and that  was just one of them with me.  He hired you, right?  He hired me.  Now, he must have given you some great promises about where you'd be at this station as far  as being on the air and doing stuff, and that's why you came aboard, right?  Right.  I mean, I was working across the street.  I'd been in New York radio for about three years after being in Jersey for like 10, and 
[01:06:30]  I finally got over there, and I interviewed, and he said, look, you know, we're going to  be making some changes.  I'll watch you on board.  I'll watch you in the building.  As things change, we're going to slot you in, and, you know, I sat there and pushed buttons  for better than a year at board hopping.  Carol would point at him.  Okay, WNW, and then point, and Eddie would push all the buttons, and Carol could sit, and  then Eddie would point to Carol, meaning, hey, it's back to you, intro and a song, or something.  The funniest thing, though, I don't know if you guys brought this up yesterday, 
[01:07:00]  but there are a couple great moments.  I don't know if you brought up the point when we had that staff meeting when all the  DJs were still there, and Gary stood in front of the table, and one of the first things he  said to the entire old staff was, Beatles, Led Zeppelin, irrelevant.  Beatles, Led Zeppelin, irrelevant.  And the look on the faces was like, Beatles, Led Zeppelin, irrelevant.  And you might not remember that, Ed, because you've had a tendency to nod off in most of  those meetings.  Yeah.  The best in that same meeting, or one right after that, he announced to the whole staff 
[01:07:30]  that had been in these seats for 20 to 30 years that Ant and I were the future of the  station.  Yeah, so they instantly hated us.  He instantly just wanted us dead.  That is like, thanks, Gary.  Thank you.  Thanks for announcing that to everybody.  And then I pitched for the Hard Rock show that I have now for like a year with him.  On Friday and Saturday nights here in New York.  Yeah, and then he finally let me do it.  And then the first week I'm about to do it, the day before I do it, he hands me a playlist. 
[01:08:00]  And I'm like, what's this?  And he said, well, that's what you're playing.  I said, I didn't work you for a year to get my own show for you to tell me what I'm playing.  Yeah, the whole thing with Eddie's show is that he does pick the music.  It's one of the few shows in the country where he does pick the music and take requests from  people and play the music he wants to play.  And that was the unique edge about the show.  And the first week it's ready to go on, Gary Wall goes, hey, here's the list of songs you play.  No, that's not what it's about. 
[01:08:30]  That wasn't what this is about.  Then it's just another crappy, programmed by him show that's on the air.  That lasted about two weeks, and then I finally just started moving away from it.  And it was basically the same thing.  It's like, we don't even know why we're printing this up because you're not following it.  And I'm like, damn right I'm...  There you go.  And then he wanted, the show's called Saturday Night Rocks.  I remember he wanted to call it the Saturday Night Rock Party.  Yeah, yeah.  The party tag at the end.  And I just said to him, Gary, I'm playing Kasha Goo Goo, so let's lose parties.  If your show has party in the title, kill yourself. 
[01:09:00]  Well, I think Saturday Night Rocks Ying Yang Party might be good.  You're doing like a Saturday night pajama party on the radio.  Kill yourself.  Well, that's how the name ended up coming up.  I mean, I'm not even thrilled with the name that it is, but it just came to a compromise  that I said, well, you know what?  I'm not using the word party.  This is not Duran Duran time over here.  Hey, Eddie, what's the name of the Friday show?  Did you ever name it?  I don't know, man.  I don't kick around a million names.  I think just to keep it easy, it's just going to be Friday Night Rock. 
[01:09:30]  Okay, Rocks, call Saturday Night Rock.  You know, it's not creative, but what the hell?  All right.  Screw it.  Eddie, we've got to get back to the tapes, but thank you.  Hey, one quick thing, you guys.  I've got to tell you a story.  When you were talking about faking...  It's never quick with you, Eddie.  That's right.  You're going to love this, though.  Remember you talking about faking phone calls?  Yeah, yeah.  We were talking about how...  And this is the guy's honest truth.  During the day, let's call it between 6 a.m. and 7 to 8 o'clock at night.  It goes even later than that.  They don't play requests on the radio stations. 
[01:10:00]  It's mathematically impossible if you think about it.  Some of the stations will do a noontime hour, and some of those are requests, but I can  even explain that a little bit.  They're already on the playlist, right?  Yeah.  It's amazing how many people don't know that, too, but I'll keep this really quick.  I did the last shift of Q104 when it was a hard rock station, right?  Yeah.  The last time it was ever a hard rock station, I did this last final shift.  So I'm following the playlist like I had to, and the guys who were flipping it to what  it is now, which is classic rock, came into me, and they said, you're following the playlist? 
[01:10:30]  And I said, well, yeah, why wouldn't I?  I mean, that's what you want me to do.  It's the last shift, right?  They said, no, no, no.  Play what you want to play.  So I start playing Slayer and Old Black Sabbath, and the phones go nuts.  People calling up saying, my God, this is what I always wanted to hear on this station.  This is the greatest thing ever.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, the time.  We've run out of time, Eddie.  Well, here's the punchline.  Oh, okay.  They were in the back during the whole time recording those comments from the listeners 
[01:11:00]  to play them back when they launched the new station playing Crosby, Stills, and Nash  into those songs.  Oh.  Yeah, that's a little radio trick.  That's true.  It was just ridiculous.  But anyway.  All right, Eddie.  Thank you, and thanks for that autograph for my nephew, bro.  All right, no problem.  I got it.  You rock.  No problem.  Mike Piazza autographed.  Oh.  He has Piazza in almost all the time, man.  I was going to say, your nephew wanted Eddie Trunk's autograph?  No, Piazza and Eddie Trunk, very, very close.  I know.  Well, Anthony, Eddie Trunk wasted our time in this segment, so now we've got to take a break. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, no, no.  Eddie, always nice.  Stop it.  Always a fine treat.  Well, we have more of the fight tapes to play.  I know.  Well, we're never getting to these.  I can't believe it.  Can we play four this time?  Oh, we only play two?  How about two more?  All right, well, let's play two quick ones, and then we'll finish up the clips after the  break.  I swear.  We're tomorrow.  Kevin from Philly checking in.  Now, this is a guy from Philly.  Does Rocco's show have party at the end of it?  See? 
[01:12:00]  We can all hate Rocco.  No matter where you're from.  All right, here's a party.  Yeah, party.  Here we are, just riding Carol and begging her to resign.  She's not going to resign.  No, I'm not going to resign.  You can have all these CDs and resign.  No, you can have these microphones and resign.  You would have the best CD collection in the history of mankind.  You know, actually, we do here at WNW, and that's why we're playing it for you.  Oh, my God.  The company line. 
[01:12:30]  This is my music, man.  Don't mess with my music.  You know what?  I respect her for that.  There you go.  She believed in that, and she was going to go down fighting.  I like people that go down fighting.  Yeah, Hitler believed in what he was doing, too.  She stinks.  No, you know what I didn't like?  I didn't like that.  It sounded to me like trying to keep the job thing, and, you know, oh, that's what we're  playing here at WNW.  That's the great music.  She was doing the company line.  Yeah, it was just like a girl.  But she didn't realize that the company could care less about the old jocks and the old music. 
[01:13:00]  All right, we'll play the analogy, and then we'll take a break and play the rest of this.  So here's the analogy.  Oh, stick around.  The Stray Cat Strut is on the way.  Can't wait to hear that again.  I think I've only heard it 8,000 times so far.  How many times have you worn those jeans?  What jeans?  I don't even have jeans on them.  Whatever they are there.  What does that have to do with the price of tomatoes?  I'll tell you what.  Because your favorite music is kind of like your favorite clothes.  I'm not wearing bell bottoms anymore.  I don't need to.  I've moved on with my hair.  You want to do that analogy.  Sometimes your underwear gets skid marks that you've got to throw away. 
[01:13:30]  Well, I'll tell you something.  If you want to talk about laundry.  Bell bottoms.  Bell bottoms are in this.  Oh, I'm turning your mic off.  We've got to move on.  All right, we're just getting warmed up.  We'll definitely play the rest of this after the break, okay?  All right?  Old Dirty in the House.  Yo, kid!  What's the deal?  We'll talk to you next as well.  Yeah!  Nothing you've imagined has prepared you for this. 
[01:14:00]  Hey, come in here.  I'm gay.  I just bonked mouth.  He said, sit on it.  So I did.  Opie and Anthony.  And we're back with the O&A show.  New York area, 877-692-1027.  Back to the tapes, Anthony.  Back to the tapes.  Yes, right away.  The Carol Miller tapes from when we first got here to N.E.W. 
[01:14:30]  She was one of the holdover jocks from the classic rock, classic jock days.  And she came on after us, so we'd butt heads during the crossover and get into these little  arguments about who was going to be successful, who wasn't.  Old Dirty, you remember those days?  Yo, Nightbird.  That was her thing on the radio, right?  That was Allison Steele.  The Nightbird died, yo.  What's up with that?  You're mixing them up.  Those were the dark days here, right? 
[01:15:00]  That's like confusing Biz Markie with Biggie Smalls.  What are you doing?  Yo, two with the metal detector, my brother.  Trying to give it into a way he can understand.  Excellent.  You having that?  He's pissed off because we used a metal detector on him.  Happy open.  He's the first guy we used a metal detector on.  That's an honor, my brother.  He's in charge of security.  Did he beep, Ben?  Anything beep on him?  Did he beep?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Did he ever beep?  Well, did we check to see what it was?  Yeah.  You know, nothing.  Eh, don't worry about it. 
[01:15:30]  It's nothing of an explosive nature.  Well, thank God.  He beeped all over the place?  No, he didn't beep as bad.  It was all over his pocket area.  Yeah.  Some change.  Maybe nail clipper.  Yeah, that's what it is.  Sure.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  So let's get back to the table.  Yeah.  Where are we on this?  Enimas.  Oh, enemas.  Sure.  We were going back and forth pretty good, and she went down to the streets of New York  and came back with some fleet enemas for us.  Yeah, for some reason she thought it would be funny. 
[01:16:00]  I didn't get the joke that she'd brought enemas back, but whatever.  A little tomfoolery.  Okay.  Carol Miller walked back in the studio and handed us enemas.  She gave us a couple of enemas.  Handed us enemas.  I don't get it, Carol.  Hello?  Hello?  I don't get it.  What does this mean?  What does this mean?  What does this mean?  I don't know.  She had to run out to the...  What does this mean?  What is wrong with you?  No, no, dear.  You see, I...  Are you having an acid flashback? 
[01:16:30]  What is an enema?  It was in there, but that was for you, dear.  What does this mean?  What does it mean?  Well, actually, you see, I, you know, I left, and I was on my conscience.  I didn't want to, you know, fight with you guys.  I love you guys.  And I thought...  What does an enema mean?  Shove it up your a**.  Wow.  So I thought perhaps there might be something, you know, constructive you can do.  So, Carol, what...  We've had enough.  I won.  Bye.  No, you didn't win. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah, I won.  No, no, trust me, you did not win.  Trust me.  Trust me, you did not win.  I got my conscience.  I speak my mind.  You don't.  One of many, my brother.  I win.  All right, and now she brings up ratings, and we had absolutely none.  Yeah, yeah, we had zero.  Yo, you had a little rinky-dink closet for an office, remember?  Yeah, we had a closet for the office. 
[01:17:30]  At this point, we've taken over half the floor.  You know what I'm saying?  Now you're big dogs on your way to Hollywood.  Remember, they gave us a tiny little closet.  Yeah.  Do you remember the fight?  Which one was this?  I was here for that?  I barely...  It was probably inebriated.  I barely knew.  Inebriated.  I barely knew O.D.  Yeah.  And remember, we were going at it with the general manager, the program director, in that  class office over there?  And you're outside like, damn, what is going on?  He's yelling at Gary Wall right to his face, going, what do you do?  Tell me, what do you do here? 
[01:18:00]  What is it you do?  That was the ice cream incident.  Yeah.  Yeah.  For another day, but yeah, I was losing it on him, trying to figure out what he did, because  what's your job here?  What do you come in and do every day?  He would leave for three to three and a half hour lunches, and all hell was breaking loose  around the station.  He had no clue, so I finally had it.  I was nose to nose with this guy, and I could see it in his eyes that he wanted to hit me  so bad, but the general manager was right there, trying to calm us all down.  Dude, those were the days, kids.  Let me tell you.  All right, here, hit the next clip about ratings. 
[01:18:30]  This one definitely hurt at the time.  You guys have been trying to make this a kick-ass rock station for 15 years.  No, no, no, no.  How many years have you been here?  I've been here 15.  Have you guys ever been out of 20th place?  Absolutely.  How long ago?  Can you remember the fact that far?  I'll tell you, when we really had our best ratings, I would say, actually, I have the  ratings at home, but 1985 or so.  We did very well.  13 years ago.  No, but we actually.  That's great.  That's fantastic.  Okay, great.  You're asking me when we had our best ratings, that would be it. 
[01:19:00]  1985.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Okay, that's great.  Yeah, okay.  So for the last 13 years, you guys have been trying to get back there, and nothing's  happened?  No, no, that's not really what happened.  Oh, man.  Why would you admit that you were good back in 85?  Yeah.  No, it was great in 85.  85.  I have the ratings at home.  All right.  I guess that wasn't the one where she was talking about our ratings.  Here's us asking her to resign again.  Carol, the offer is here.  Resign on the air right now. 
[01:19:30]  Listen.  You'll be the talk of New York again.  Well, at least I'll come up with you talking.  I ain't talking about you.  You want to make a bet?  That's how out of touch you are, Carol.  Oh, come on.  You don't even know.  Listen, I will get the U-Haul.  You can take all those CDs.  I'm serious.  This isn't a joke anymore.  You can take all the CDs, and all the old jocks from here could go find another radio  station.  Notice all the ones that have been fired from here.  No one's picking them up, because no one cares.  You guys are all out of touch.  No one cares anymore.  Let me tell you something.  Take the CDs and find another radio station. 
[01:20:00]  Simple as that.  No one cares.  Shut up for a second.  I want to say something.  We are not...  You are employed here to do bits and to do...  No, I'm employed.  I cannot come in and level you the way maybe it would be fun to do.  It's just not my gig.  I can't do it.  So I will not do it.  I can't do much of anything.  No, I can't do much of anything, but I got a career in radio.  I don't know what you got.  I have a career in radio.  I've been doing this for 18 years.  You've been here for three months?  18 years.  Oh, that's how they rate people around here. 
[01:20:30]  How long have you been at any W?  So let's hole it up, you know?  I mean, cut it.  Cut it, man.  There you go.  No, seriously.  Take the CDs.  Stop being serious about this.  I'm very serious about this.  Well, that's your problem.  It sucks, and it's time to move forward.  Well, that's your problem.  You're being serious about this.  You're getting all a bit out of shape.  We're celebrating a relic.  We're doing a celebration for a relic.  Oh, my God.  That is uncomfortable.  Oh, isn't that just...  I used to be in that city.  Damn.  Hey, man, that's close to three years ago, 
[01:21:00]  and all the jocks that got fired from here,  where are they?  Opie, you are vicious, man.  What did I say?  Yeah, I don't do much of anything.  Nobody cares.  Not much of anything.  And you knew that nobody really did.  Nobody cares.  This is the end of the first confrontation.  This is the end of the first confrontation.  Okay, go ahead.  It was great.  It was great back then.  It's done.  Let's move on.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Go away.  Bye-bye.  No, seriously, bye.  Bye.  All right, look at this.  Our big boss is in. 
[01:21:30]  He doesn't like it.  Rick, take her headphones off.  Bye.  No, no, no, no.  I take them off myself.  Bye.  Don't lay a finger on me.  Don't.  Just leave.  It's our show.  We don't want you on anymore.  I'm turning your mic off.  Bye.  You made your point.  You're powerful.  Turn it off, baby.  Bye.  Wow.  Bye.  Bye.  Leave.  It's our show.  Leave.  All right, fine.  We'll just sit here.  You can't just sit here.  I'll sit here.  What's up next, though?  I don't know.  We sat uncomfortably with the boss in the studio for a few minutes, Norton, because 
[01:22:00]  she wouldn't leave.  So I'm like, all right, fine.  Just uncomfortable silence.  Do you know how badly you have to be shredded on the air to sit there and refuse to leave?  Yeah.  It's almost like you know you've been pounded.  You're just hoping a moment comes where you can fight back.  That was awful.  So the big boss got her out, and then she returned.  Again?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  And that one phone rang.  That's right.  And we had a 2-2 in the afternoon, made it into the newspapers. 
[01:22:30]  You guys didn't even hit the top 20.  Carol, Carol, don't even sit there and think what you do on the radio is actually getting  ratings.  That's ridiculous.  No, I'm a support player.  That's ridiculous.  I'm a support player.  You've got to start this over.  You jumped in the middle of this for some reason.  Go all the way to the beginning.  I know.  Go all the way to the beginning.  We were talking about ratings, and she was bragging that when she was doing this show  that we're doing now, that at one time she got a 2.2, and all the papers wrote about  it.  The papers wrote about a 2-2.  All right. 
[01:23:00]  It kind of hurt, because at the time, I think the show was like a 1-4, maybe.  Is a 2-2 good, though?  No.  No.  2-2 stinks.  Yeah.  No, seriously.  Right now, the show is around a 5, just to give you an idea.  When we took it over, it was a 1.4, and she was bragging that one time it was at a 2.2.  Okay, that's what she was talking about when we jumped in the middle of this segment.  Go.  That's right.  That's right, and we had a 2-2 in the afternoon, made it into the newspapers.  You guys didn't get to the top 20. 
[01:23:30]  Carol, don't even sit there and think what you do on the radio is actually getting ratings.  That's ridiculous.  No, I'm a support player.  That's ridiculous.  I'm a support player.  You don't support us, and we don't support you.  Simple as that.  Stay out of our face, and we'll stay out of yours.  Get out of my studio.  You're off now.  No, we're off when we're done.  We're off when we're done.  We've been told that.  Yeah, but you just ran your commercials, you see, after the hour, which is practically illegal.  Stay out of our face, and we'll stay out of yours.  And stop talking behind our backs to every single person that works here, because they  come right to us and tell us what you're saying.  And you know what's really funny? 
[01:24:00]  You're a little crybaby.  You're everything I hate about radio.  And you know something?  Sit down and let Ed point to you so you can go, www.wnew.com.  You see, dumb and dumber.  No one tunes you in.  Dumb and dumber.  No one tunes you in to hear you intro records.  Listen, but nobody tunes you.  You're high.  Nobody tunes you're in period.  You're absolutely high if you...  No, I don't.  People are tuning us in, Carol.  Trust me.  No, I don't think people tune me in to hear records.  Trust me.  Trust me.  They are tuning us in. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, maybe in Siberia if they've got us out on it.  Oh, yeah.  That hurts.  Listen, I'm only here as a support player, and I...  Siberia.  It started really getting ugly there.  These are just excerpts.  These fights went on for like 20 straight minutes.  Yeah, they would just go on and on.  Someday, maybe we'll play the whole thing.  She would just...  Just the way you kept hammering her impediment.  No, we also started doing...  We just kept doing our radio show until we felt like leaving. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, that was another thing.  We used to drive her and the rest of the staff nuts.  Were you allowed to do that?  Yeah, well, not really, but we weren't syndicated at the time, so we...  They sort of gave the okay, I think.  Yeah.  So if we wanted to really F with her, sure, we would stay on.  Why not?  We'd stay on an extra hour doing absolutely nothing.  Why is Opie's voice so high?  I guess it's not just the old Boston tapes.  Which one is this?  Where are we?  This is when you start hammering on what does she do. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, hit this one.  What do you do, Carol?  What do you do?  What do I do?  You can't even run the stupid board.  I can run the board.  I elect not to.  Then why don't you do it?  Why do you have to allow Eddie to sit here and push your buttons?  He points at you and you go, oh, W-N-E-W-D-O.  Hey, let me tell you something.  Black Rose are coming to the Beacon Theater.  No, I choose not to run the board.  Hey, listen.  What do you do, Carol?  I choose not to run the board because I enjoy it.  You want to challenge me and you say, I'm not a comedian and I don't do bits and I don't do a show.  You're serious.  You know why?  What do you do? 
[01:26:00]  What do you do?  No, no, no.  Tell me what you do.  I'm not a comedian.  Tell me what you bring to the audience.  What is my role here?  Yeah, what is your role?  I'd like to know that.  Okay.  If you shut up for a minute, I'll tell you.  All right, go ahead.  Go ahead.  I've been people's friend for quite a long time.  We all grew up together.  Friend.  That's my role.  W-N-E-W-D-O.  That is my role.  That is my role.  Yeah, that was the line she had.  Nor has nothing to say.  Just what a child.  He keeps going, W-N-E-W-D-O to W-N-E-W-D-O.  You're like the annoying kid in school that would just keep poking somebody. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, I'll quit it.  I'll quit it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that was what she would say, too.  She would say that she was people's friend.  They would tune in not just to hear her music, but it would be like listening to a friend.  There you go.  I have never tuned in to listen to a friend play music, ever.  What's the challenge?  I don't remember this one.  Okay, here we go. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, the challenge.  Okay.  And I'll tell you what.  You know something?  You're such a wuss that you wouldn't like a challenge.  I challenge you, okay?  Challenge me to what, Carol?  Whatever.  What?  You go on stage together.  You tell me who more people would say hello to and think thanks for being a friend.  Carol, you had 50 years in this town.  We've had seven months.  I don't even know how long.  I know I was like four when I started listening to you.  Yeah, right.  You guys are about five years younger than me.  30 years.  So what are you talking about?  30 years.  Sorry. 
[01:27:30]  You've had 30 years.  You know what?  Just because I started when I was a teenager and I happened to do well enough, you finally  get to New York when you're frigging 37.  Yeah.  Aren't you 37?  That hurts.  No, I'm not 37, Carol.  Well, your pal is.  I'm 35.  Oh, good for you.  Are you toilet trained yet?  Yeah, I'm toilet trained.  This is good.  See, if you did this type of radio, maybe people would sit around and listen to you, too.  Oh, I'm not for...  W-N-E-W-D-O-D-O-D-O-D-O-D.  Oh, you want to invite me now?  Another qualifier coming this hour, Ted Nugent.

[01:36:30]  kid  go for the gold  only need one  that's a funny line actually  what  i'm dropping him off  at the front door  the whole bit is hilarious  just that he admits to  so many people that  he's useless as a man  is great  i don't think that's quite the point  he was trying to get across  oh  oh that's what i found funny about it  oh  he said something like  his sperm is on jet skis anyway

[01:39:30]  the couch from animal house  like that's the other celebrity  and they voted me off first  you know i got two out of three questions right  and the third  the question you got you didn't get  i was a crazy question  she uh  is jet lagged i guess  because she fought annie robinson  who by the way is really cool  when you meet her  so but  she asked it in like korean or something  it was what's the achoo syndrome  but instead of medicine  she said medicine  achoo syndrome  i don't know  special number six  you know

[01:50:30]  drug of choice  are you on that  probably cigarettes  cigarettes  yeah  i can't seem to quit smoking man  the singers love the cigarettes man  i bet that brian guy  uh from octane  he sounded like he smokes  cigarettes  they love the cigarettes  cigarettes are more addictive  than heroin kid  didn't you know  they manipulate the  the chemicals  and the tobacco  and all that  and cook you  another conspiracy  from old dirty  dude  travis  what kind of cigarettes  do you smoke  you know 
[01:51:00]  you know  what i smoke  marlboro lights  man  with all the  thank you  you gotta  all the chemicals man  you gotta  cowboy killers  you gotta make the full commitment  you gotta go with the marlboro  if you're smoking marlboro  you gotta smoke the reds  right  and if you're smoking  anything else  you gotta go up a notch  to the camel non-filter  i'm pushing out  ain't i  i smoke parlaments  because they have those little filters  it feels like a little catheter  hey travis  you're a huge doors fan  and uh you did a great job  with the end  on that tribute album man  yeah

[01:55:30]  dragged on her body  dragged on her body  i hear jim's there  huh  i hear jim norton's there  uh  he loves the studio  well tell him i say hi  i will  why would you want that  because after you've  been in jail with someone  for 28 hours  you kind of get that  little jail bond  that's right  they were jailmates  i forgot about that  i forgot that jim went  to jail for our show  yeah  yeah man  jackie was there as well  cool  all right so we're  going to have you come in  and hopefully uh  freddie krueger's a good  sport  i hope so  yeah  i hope it's not uh  what's his name 
[01:56:00]  robert england  yes  it's robert england  i want him to be  freddie krueger  we got jackie the knife girl  he's got to go the distance  he's got to bring in the  the mask  he's not going to say  i'm your boyfriend now  he's probably going to be  like okay i'll  can we get at least  a freddie krueger mask  so he doesn't have to  put all the makeup on  oh he is not going to  put on a freddie krueger mask  then why is he coming here  he's coming here to talk  about boogeyman  the cd uh the dvd release  i saw that  it's cool right  it looks awesome  yeah definitely  it's all the scenes  from all the movies  you know and love 
[01:56:30]  all the gory scenes  he plays freddie krueger  so you know  but it's robert england  who set up our interview  with freddie krueger  i believe rick  rick  let's make sure  the guy's coming in  as freddie krueger  oh my god  jackie the knife girl  you're going to ruin it  jackie the knife girl  is coming in  we need freddie krueger  to be freddie krueger  you're going to ruin it  who cares  it'll be a great radio bit  he probably doesn't  go around as freddie krueger  rick  no  could you get the  freddie krueger people  on the phone 
[01:57:00]  we want to find out  if he'll come in  as freddie krueger  and it's robert england  could you talk to freddie  i'm a little afraid  for my emotions  to come there though  why  why  because there's no  world trade center  i know  it's very upsetting  trust me  we've been trying to  like put it out of our  mind for a little while  i know  it's hard because  we're 1.6 miles away  to our right here  from  yeah and this will be  the first time  ever coming to  new york city  and they're  just not there  it's very strange  i don't know what to say  to that  well 
[01:57:30]  look  you you come down  here  does the thought  of freddie krueger  um  knives on you  yes i would  brave my fears  for freddie krueger  wouldn't that be  something  all of a sudden  he's rubbing  knives  on you  no we need  to  maybe the guy  who uh  brought us  the freddie krueger  hand knife thing  yeah  last year  i thought  no i want freddie krueger  to bring his own  he doesn't have  that's a prop  it's probably  a collector's item  that's in some  museum somewhere  i think freddie  has it  hanging in his  living room  robert england  has a glove  that he's gonna 
[01:58:00]  put on and bring  down  it was a prop  what a great way  to pick up chicks  you're in a bar  you're in a bar  you say i got the mask  and the gloves  at home  of course he  he definitely has  at least the freddie krueger  mask  yeah but that is like  that is like something  that's probably in a glass  case that he wouldn't  take out  no no it was makeup  when he made the movie  i'm saying he's got  a freddie krueger mask  as a goof  in his uh  in his home  oh my god  i can't believe you  with the blade gloves  hanging next to the  mask  what a great way  to pick up chicks 
[01:58:30]  i just think  we should have one  here for him  i don't think  he'll bring one  thank you jim  i think that's wise  opie  it's after 5 o'clock  can you talk to  freddie's people  tomorrow and see  if he's gonna  be a good sport  i'll see if he'll  come in full regalia  explain that we  have this girl  that loves having  knives dragged  across her body  and she  orgasms  try to get  william shatner  to come in  as captain turk  exactly  you know  these people  don't do this  they will not  do this  water on a chick  yeah  yeah

[02:03:00]  I don't know. 
[02:03:30]  I don't know.  You hear the play?  You're listening to the sounds of the knifing. 
[02:04:00]  They don't usually bring you the sounds of a girl being stroked with a knife.  Watch that knip.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He's working.  This is a turn-on.  Go for her throat. 
[02:04:30]  Oh, you wrecked it.  Hey, I ruined it.  You ruined it.  I ruined it.  What a way to end, though.  Bravo!  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Nice.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony, it's the kind of show where you can feel out your sister, feel out your  sister, feel out your sister.  Opie and Anthony.  You guys are awesome. 
[02:05:00]  It's like I got to listen to you.  It's like a drug.  Anthony, Pinnacle Hornigot Way.  Hey, Pinnacle Hornigot Way, the all-natural herbal sexual enhancer.  It can jumpstart your love life, increase your confidence in the bedroom, improving your  performance, bringing a whole new level of pleasure and satisfaction to you and your partner.  Old Dirty, are you still on the Pinnacle Hornigot Way?  Every now and then, you know, I need a little nitrous pickup.  Right.  And the Hornigot Way, especially nowadays, man, you got to be close to the one you love, so  you got to give it to them the correct way. 
[02:05:30]  And if you can't do it by yourself, you need the Hornigot Way, my brother.  Listen to that testimonial.  That's what you got to do.  Done in genuine urban gibberish.  You're foul, man.  Pinnacle Hornigot Way.  There he is.  Another satisfied customer.  He busts three nuts or something like that.  He says.  You can find Pinnacle Hornigot Weed at GNC and other fine health food stores.  Go ahead.  Go for it.  What have you got to lose except your inhibitions, doubts, and excuses for not having some of 
[02:06:00]  that great sex?  Pinnacle Hornigot Weed.  Opie and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's go right to the phones.  Busy show today.  Claire, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  I was calling to see if Jackie and I felt like having her clothes cut off.  I'm trying to remember.  We asked her all that.  Yeah, she likes having her clothes cut off.  Sure.  Why not?  Yep.  You like that too? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, I cut off Al Dukes clothes before on the Ron and Fez show.  I came into the Ron and Fez show and I cut off Al Dukes clothes and cut mine off.  Who?  What?  I don't know Al Dukes.  Oh, you don't?  Okay.  Al Dukes.  I don't know Al Dukes.  I don't know Al Dukes.  I wish we could have you on, but then that's like, you know.  Yeah, man.  There's this weird thing in radio.  If you're on another show, then we can't put you on ours.  Unless you change your name.  Unless Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  Unless Ron and Fez give us permission, you know?  Ron and Fez give you permission. 
[02:07:00]  I can do what I want.  No.  No, you can't.  We got to show the respect to Ron and Fez who are on after us in the year.  I love Ron and Fez.  I go on their show all the time.  You call them up tonight and discuss.  All I wanted to do was cut Jackie's clothes off.  All right.  Well, you call their show tonight, discuss it with them.  If they give the okay, then sure.  We'd love to have you on the show.  Okay?  Okay.  Can I ask a question, though?  Thank you.  Yeah.  Are you fat?  No.  There's pictures of me.  I'm not fat.  No?  I have my own eyes, too.  Do you have big boobies?  Yes, I do.  You're a whore. 
[02:07:30]  Easy.  That's not nice.  All right, Claire.  Talk to Ron and Fez, and then we'll try to work something out, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Someone's saying she's really hot.  Oh, cool.  Jackie, what's up?  Jackie!  We lose Jackie?  Hey, yo.  I have a hyper dog, but when he heard Jackie moan, he shut up.  You.  That's you, Jackie.  Hi.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yes.  We just wasted 20 seconds.  What's wrong with you?  We could have played another commercial.  Just kidding.  What's wrong with you? 
[02:08:00]  Why weren't you answering us?  Because I was going into a dead zone on my cell phone.  You were what?  What?  Jackie.  You were eating calzones on the bed?  Jackie, the time on our show is becoming so valuable with all the commercials they're  shoving down our throats.  You got to get right to the point.  I hit a dead zone.  I'm sorry.  All right.  So, what do you want to say?  Now that we wasted a minute, we could have done a stack of two-ree.  Let's go.  I wanted to see if I could get, like, a loop of Jackie the Knife Girl, because whenever  my dog hears her, he quiets down and settles down and will go to sleep. 
[02:08:30]  No, you can't.  You can't provide that for your best friend?  Huh?  No, I'm sorry.  Sorry.  You would have to pay for that tape.  Jake, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Boston check in.  Hey, listen.  Hey, Boston.  Boston, tomorrow.  Huge wow sticker stop at Newberry Comics and Braintree.  Sweet.  I'll be there.  We're hoping to see a lot of you on there on there.  Hey, listen, if that Freddy Krueger guy won't dress up, call Johnny Depp.  Have him come in as Edward Scissorhands.  I don't think he's doing anything.  Yeah, maybe Johnny Depp will come in, Opie, with the Scissorhand thing as Edward Scissorhands. 
[02:09:00]  Why not?  Now that you think Robert Englund's going to come down as Freddy Krueger.  He better.  It ain't going to happen.  We're going to find out, because Rick's going to talk to the publicist.  You are insane.  I will bet you.  How many times have you listened to radio shows, and you get excited because someone's coming in,  and they have nothing to add to the show?  What are we going to say to Robert Englund that people out there are going to go,  wow, that was a really good interview.  I didn't say that that's not going to take place.  But what I'm saying is you're not going to get him to come in.  What better than him coming in as Freddy Krueger? 
[02:09:30]  I would agree, but it ain't going to happen.  It would freak the F out of all of us in the studio.  Then we got Jackie the Knife Girl that likes having knives dragged on her body.  It's an instant classic bit.  Maybe we can put a clue on the steps so he sinks into it as he walks down.  Yeah, right?  I have faith in Rick that he's going to pull us off.  Oh, stop it.  Faith in Rick, now I know you're kidding.  Come on, man.  The nightmare movies is classic, son.  Of course.  All right.  Rick's going to work on it, though.  All dirty.  What's the deal?  I hear you got a new business that you have started. 
[02:10:00]  I'm in the pharmaceuticals now.  You see how much money Pfizer made last year?  Now, when you say pharmaceuticals, I know in the past you were in pharmaceuticals also.  No, but it's something that you couldn't find on the New York Stock Exchange.  Right, right.  Well, we're going to trade publicly in a couple of years.  So now you're saying that you're distributing what type of pharmaceuticals?  We have the anthrax pill, Ron, Wade.  Yeah, well, you know, it's better safe to be sorry, you know what I mean?  Some of the homeboys now are selling the antibiotics that you have to take after you've been exposed to anthrax. 
[02:10:30]  Wait, that's the latest scam in the hood?  You guys got the anthrax pill?  We've spoken about it.  This is a small supply.  What about gas masks?  Nah, man, because I, yo, like I bought one, dude.  Yeah?  Take two?  So we're talking like a buck 75.  Wow, that's expensive for a gas mask.  Yeah, so then yesterday I'm looking at the news and the news, oh, well, you got to have it on all day.  Way before the attack comes, I'm like, what's the use of that?  All dirty, but it's very valuable because you could use that gas mask to get high. 
[02:11:00]  You ever do that?  Oh, yeah, we've been playing seeds in the filter, son.  Someone in college used to have the gas mask?  The gas mask.  It would rock.  They'd fill it up with the smoke and you'd just start breathing.  Yeah, the gas mask.  What?  That's like the crazy shotgun, kid.  Yeah, kid.  They say, yeah, a lot of people saying, you know, you have to be wearing the gas mask.  I mean, you can't go, oh, I smell something or, oh, maybe I ought to put it on.  You know, you got to have it on.  But if you get a report that says, oh, my God, something's happened in such and such a city and the wind's blowing, 
[02:11:30]  so you better watch, then you'll be happy if you have it.  Yeah, no doubt.  And now you got the antibiotics.  Diagnostics.  Yeah, what's the name of it, though?  Well, I'd rather not mention it on the air.  It might be a copyright infringement.  You know what I mean?  You just sell aspirin and say, no, this is the generic version.  I didn't know the anthrax thing was shaped like Fred Flintstone.  You never know, right?  Yeah, but, you know, truthfully, I hope it doesn't happen, you know what I'm saying? 
[02:12:00]  But, you know, you just got to be on the right.  Yo, what's up?  How many can I write you down for, Antonio?  Better safe than sorry.  No, you know something, I don't think.  How much will you be selling these pills for?  Well, I don't know how much they go for in the legitimate market.  Right.  We're going to go for, like, $2.50.  $2.50 a pill?  Yeah, and if, like, the anxiety level rises, then, you know, unfortunately, we'll have  to capitalize on it.  Supply and demand. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, my God.  I feel bad, dude.  Trust me, man.  I feel it, dude.  You suck.  It's the overhead, my brother.  The overhead.  There's a company called Merck, and he's got a company called Perk.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe you're going to exploit this situation.  What's the deal?  I always want to know something.  What's up?  Look at me.  I'm as white as it comes, right?  Snowflake white.  You see me coming into the hood to get a little something.  What you need?  What are you doing to me? 
[02:13:00]  What am I doing to you?  What kind of bait and switch method are you using on me?  Yeah.  My brother, my...  Yo, look at you.  Look at you.  Blind hair, blue eyes.  Man, you got money.  We're going to treat you good.  So you want a beer?  No, no, no.  Come on.  Dude, we'll even get you a...  Let me in on the secret.  We'll even get you a hum-up stance on the fair floor, my man.  Let me in on the secret.  You got the really good stuff, and then you got the, you know...  Depending on what you...  Well, you look like a DEA agent.  I don't think...  Oh, yeah.  You don't even get Tylenol.  He's looking bad.  So you got the pharmacy, dude.  No, they were never... 
[02:13:30]  Come on.  No, but if you come with Abel...  Proper Abel Crombie and Fitch footwear, Timbaland...  Are you got...  No?  Is the hood giggling as they see me pull out?  Nah, you crazy?  They're giggling like, look, man.  We're going to give them the bait and switch.  They're like this.  Yo, yo.  Yo, dude.  You ain't get on the roof yet.  What?  What are you pulling up in?  Yo, yo.  Chill.  You white?  See if he got a bulge in his pocket.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Let him come up.  Yo, yo, yo.  What's up?  What you need?  Yeah.  Yo, punk.  You're my brother.  It's trick-ass, you know?  I know.  Yeah.  But what are you selling me?  What you want? 
[02:14:00]  How bad is it cut?  Ooh.  Yeah, that's what I'm selling.  Don't be bad, Opie.  Don't be bad, Opie.  Look, your buddy PR is laughing uncontrollably in the background.  Opie, Opie, back your brother up.  Man, what are you doing?  I just want to know something.  How bad is it cut when you see me coming?  Yeah.  It's good, dude.  I have an important question.  How many of these anthrax pills do you need?  Well, you only need one, I think, after the initial, because it's like an antibiotic, you  know, type thing.  Yeah.  That's why I think you don't only need one. 
[02:14:30]  Why do I not buy that the CDC isn't distributing these, but you can get them from Old Dirty?  Well, it's prescription.  They say call your doctor if you're worried about this.  Don't go buying it.  And the thing is, you have to take this antibiotic and start this treatment before you show any  symptoms, my brother.  No, no, no.  They said, no, wait a minute.  Oh.  Yeah.  I'm talking to, I've read and heard this.  I say, if you start taking it before, then your body builds up a resistance.  So when the real deal comes, it ain't going to happen. 
[02:15:00]  You know what happens with antibiotics, my friend?  You build up a resistance to the antibiotics.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  It's not going to work.  What if your level of protection goes down and you come to see me and you take like four  and it don't work?  If you take antibiotics, your body will then reject it.  It builds up resistance to the drug.  I know what you're saying.  So that now, if you take it, it's not going to do anything even when you need it.  So then if you happen to get affected by anthrax, nothing's going to happen, is what you're  saying?  No, no.  You will die even if you take the medication. 
[02:15:30]  That's all right.  So me and you are on the same page, my brother.  That's what I'm saying.  You really are.  And let me tell you something else.  We really are, Anthony.  I'm telling you.  Anthrax, if you inhale it, 90 to 100% death rate.  Oh, yeah.  Even if you take medicine.  Well, dude, they're talking about if you get it in broken skin or something like that or  you eat something that's contaminated, then there's a chance if you take the antibiotic  before you show symptoms that you'll pull out of it.  But breathing it in the way they would distribute it as terrorist would by crop duster or something, 
[02:16:00]  you're dead.  90% death rate.  Well, Anthony, you've knocked sales down 80%.  So I don't, I don't know how to stop because...  I got a whole skid of these pills.  I don't know what to do with it now.  The stock is plummeting.  Oh, man.  What a stock analyst.  You go, yo, don't have a regular company again, bro.  I'm sorry.  I feel like I'm in the middle of trading places right now.  It's plummeting.  I mean, they wouldn't sell the pill if it didn't work, bro, you know? 
[02:16:30]  No.  A little something.  Not in the hood, they wouldn't.  No.  Ah, Fran, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Well, you guys know those gas masks don't work against any kind of nerve or biological agent.  They're only good for tear gas.  Look, it's like those, that gas mask.  You know, there's all kinds of gas masks, some that won't do crap, some that work fine,  but your skin will melt away.  Like, there's all kinds, you can't just say, that gas mask, all right, what is it?  The gas masks are selling in the Army Navy stores, especially the Israeli ones, are like 
[02:17:00]  20 bucks.  Yeah, the $20 one.  I said, I know, because I'm in the military and we deal with it a lot.  Right.  We go through all that fun training.  All right, Fran.  Thank you.  No problem.  Peace.  Hey, Old Dirty, while we have you in here, Jay Moore's calling back in a few minutes,  by the way.  Finally got a hold of him.  You know, we've been playing the bad World Trade Center tribute songs.  Tali, what was the other one that you paid at $3.30?  They're awful.  Oh, the Tali, man.  Yeah, we hate that one. 
[02:17:30]  Yeah, why don't we get the person who wrote that down here real quick so I can punch them  in the face.  That's awful.  Oh, D, we're getting about 10 of these a day at this point.  Everyone is trying to capitalize and everyone's trying to come up with that one song that  everyone is going to, you know, latch onto and go, wow, this says it all for all  of us, man.  Come on, man.  What do they think?  They're going to get a record deal after all this is over?  Dude, the world changed on September 11.  Don't come out here with your calm ball music.  You ain't trying to amuse me with that, punk.  Well, you know, D.S. is trying to set it off on this point. 
[02:18:00]  You know what I mean?  Well, O.D., one came in.  It has kind of a hip-hop clave to it.  A hip-hop.  So I want to get your honest opinion, all right?  All right.  Because we don't know.  We're too white for this crap.  It's called USA Holla If You're With Me.  Holla if you're with me.  There you go.  And they don't spell holler like you and I, Anthony.  It's holla.  For the record, it stinks already.  It's H-O-L-L-A.  Holla.  Is that one of the words of the hood these days?  Holla?  Holla back, my man.  Give me a holla?  Holla. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And this is sponsored by Old Dirty's drug of choice that he's selling.  It's called Placebo.  That's great.  Get on board.  Sales are down another 15%.  I want the whole workforce cut in half.  And the name of the band is Mixed Brie.  Let's do it.  Whether we bring our enemies to justice or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done.

[02:25:30]  What's up?  He looks like a supremacist too, right?  Hey, J. Moore, what's up?  Gentlemen, how are you?  There he is  You know, who the heck's going to buy  Any medicine that's not coke or pop  Off a blanky Puerto Rican in the Bronx?  He's selling the anthrax pill  Yo, J., how many can I get you down for, my brother?  Yeah, no, you can pass  Just have a sack of weed ready for me  Yeah  I can't believe you think  You're going to make a profit on this, ODB  Oh, but you know  You've got to try 
[02:26:00]  You've got to break into new markets  He was going to  But then Anthony busted his spot, yo  Yeah, I screwed things up  Hey, did I do that right, Older?  He busted his spot?  No  No, what is it?  You blew up the spot  I blew up the spot  I knew it was up to win  And then he dropped a dime on him  Right  Dropped a dime?  That's old school, Jay  But it's still pertinent, gentlemen  Hey, Jay, how famous are you getting  That you're in New York  And now you call in your appearances  Yeah, I know  Wait, what?  How come?  I wanted to come in  Today? 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, Rick told me to call  Are you coming in tomorrow, then?  Sure  All right  I hope  I mean, I'm a little distracted right now  Because I called last break  And it was about a seven-minute break  And then my wife and I made some bacon  And she's actually standing on her head right now  Oh, trying to get the pregnant thing going  Oh, God, it's impossible  To get your wife pregnant is impossible  Every other girl you bang on the road  They get pregnant in two seconds  And you've got to bury them in the woods someplace  Oh, God 
[02:27:00]  A la Norton  Hey, wow  Why wasn't that line on Conan O'Brien last night?  Yeah, why as well, then?  You're in bed, now it's mine!  I think that line would have killed on Conan last night  What do you think, Jay?  Well, you know what?  Hindsight is always 20-20, isn't it, gentlemen?  Where's the lovely Nicole?  Is she all right with you telling...  She's literally on my bed, standing on her head  You're all right with, you know  She's all right with you telling the world  That you have a low sperm count  And you guys are trying to, you know, get pregnant?  Yeah, because it doesn't make her any less hot  She makes me look like an idiot 
[02:27:30]  Right  I have the sperm count of a dog  That's been hit by a car on the 15 freeway  On the way to Vegas  And no one picked it up yet  Wow  Oh, God  That's great, Jay  You know what's funny?  In the commercial break of Conan O'Brien  Yeah  I went over to Max Weinberg  Yeah  You know, Springsteen's drummer  Go over, give a little respect  Nice guy  And he goes, hey, is all that stuff true?  And I go, yeah  And he goes, when I said the line  You have to ride a bike  And you ride the smoke pot  And ride a bike every day of your life  Yeah  He goes, yeah  Hey, that pot stuff 
[02:28:00]  That doesn't bother you, man  I went through the good old days  That pot doesn't do anything to you  Max Weinberg was telling me that  Oh, really?  That was funny  How many kids does he have?  I wanted to tell you  Pot doesn't do anything  How many kids does he have?  He's got two  Oh, yeah?  Yo, Jay  Yo, Jay  You try icing the yam bag down?  You can put a little ice on a herd act  Mine were already so small  If I iced them  They'd be the size of chiclets  I can't afford to have my nads get any smaller  Not my crank  Hey, Jay  You disappoint a lot of ONA fans 
[02:28:30]  By getting off the weakest link so early, man  Yeah, I disappointed myself, too  That bitch  Why would they vote you off so fast?  Well, I have no idea  But you know what?  The host of the show  Was actually super cool  Annie Robinson  Oh, yeah?  And super funny and nice  I saw her on the plane  On the way to D.C.  And she was, you know  She was just cool  She didn't want me to go  She knew  The people knew  And how did you get thrown off?  That's what burns my ass 
[02:29:00]  Is it defies logic  Because I got two out of three questions right  And the question I got wrong  The host, Ann Robinson  She said it to me like in Korean or Portuguese or something  The answer was a sneeze  What medicinal term known as the Achoo Syndrome  Is better known as a what?  Achoo is what you go  Achoo  Achoo  It's like how you  Go ahead  I keep interrupting you, Anthony  I apologize  No, it's like how you spell a sneeze  You know, you go  Achoo  But she's from England 
[02:29:30]  And maybe she was jet-lagged  And she just like  Strung it all together  And she didn't say medicinal  She said like  What, mesinal?  Yeah, that's true  You know what, though?  You just go about it  And say, I don't know  Or you'd make something up  What it was, I hear  You took too long  No, I said  Could you repeat the question?  Now, when you repeat the question  You better goddamn get it right  Or else those people are going to be like  Oh, now you used up time for another question  Well, I don't know how to speak homeless  It's not my fault  She asked it to me  Gibberish  And then that lady, Alexandra 
[02:30:00]  That was in Living Color  The blonde girl  Uh-huh  That dumb simpleton whore  Goddamn  You didn't see what got cut out of the show  Right  That's what I wanted to ask  So now you get voted off  You turn around  And something was said about  She's the one with George Stephanopoulos  Right  Everyone has their reason for voting me off  The kid next to me says  I voted him off  Because I thought he was going to vote me off  I understand that  Because the second I got there  I told him I was going to vote him off 
[02:30:30]  Right  Just to make him nervous  Terry Gard votes me off  Because I think Jay was the easiest to spell  Okay  Because she's not, you know  Right  That's funny  Out of love, I say that  Sure  And then they go to the other guy  Who, I still don't know who the guy is  The bald guy?  Yeah  Do you know that guy?  No  No  Well, Celebrity Jeopardy  Jeopardy  Or whatever it was  Weakest Link  Okay  He says because 
[02:31:00]  It takes a long time to shoot the show  And he says  Well, Jay jokes around a lot  And I didn't want to be here all night  Even that I'm fine with  Even though he's a pussy  Dude, I will punch him in the face, dude  I'll be like  No, no  C-O-D-B  That's what I thought  You know what I'm saying?  But the next one was the capper  Yeah  Dean Cain didn't vote me off  And he's Superman  He's got to know something about what he's doing  And Michael Rappaport didn't vote me off  Because he's, you know  A couple of East Coast guys  Uh-huh  So they say to Alexandra 
[02:31:30]  Why did you vote Jay off?  She says  Because  He didn't call me back  And we dated a couple of years ago  All right  But he sold it like it was true  Oh, really?  Right  Well, like literally  People are going  What?  The makeup artist for Conan O'Brien  Is going  Yeah, what was up with you and Alexandra?  It was true, right?  No  Absolutely not  Why would she say it?  Because she's an idiot  If Nicole wasn't standing on her head  And she wouldn't  And she isn't hearing this  Would it be true?  I swear to God  On my mother's soul 
[02:32:00]  You never slammed her  She never even drank one of your low count batches?  No  Oh my God  Let my entire family get slow stomach cancer  If I'm lying  Wow  I didn't kiss this girl  Ever  Nothing  No innuendo  Nothing  So now you turn around  When you get ready to leave  And you said  No, it gets better  Okay, all right  This is how I know  Ann Robinson liked me  Yeah  Okay  She looks at Alexandra and says  Why did you vote Jay off?  And she says  Like that garbage about  We used to date  Uh-huh  And she goes  No, seriously 
[02:32:30]  Why did you vote him off?  And she goes  I don't know  She goes  What do you mean you don't know?  And then the girl  Alexandra says  Is this all because I'm blonde?  And Ann Robinson says  Is that what you call it?  Oh, man  Like she buries her  Yeah  And then she says  Jay was not statistically the weakest link  Do you know who was?  And she goes  Who?  And she goes  You were  Ooh  Why did you vote him off?  And she goes  Can we change the subject?  She goes  Okay  What do you do besides act?  Like Ann was killing her 
[02:33:00]  Yeah  And she goes  Well, I'm moving to New York  And she says  Why not?  Isn't Los Angeles big enough for you?  She goes  No, I'm getting married  To George Stephanopoulos  Like we live it out there  Like we give a crap  Right  Hey, creep  Yo, Jay Moore  Hey, Dice  Yeah  What's up?  Well, there goes that story  Yeah, there goes that story  And there goes you  That's what I figured  What was that about, creep?  Uh-oh  What's wrong, Dice?  Yeah, he knows what I'm calling about 
[02:33:30]  What?  What was that about?  So, I look at Alexandra  Right  Don't be stupid  Let me finish your story, Dice  Don't tell me what you're going to finish  I'm going to finish you  I want to know what he said  Otherwise, you put him on the line, stupid  I had to wait on hold  All right, hold on  Like I put him on  All right, hold on  Let me  Like I push the buttons, Jay Moore  All right, Jay, Dice  Finish your story  Oh, that's going to make him twice as mad, too  Finish your story  Great  So I look at her and I say 
[02:34:00]  Because you're supposed to say something smart-ass to the host  But I like the host  Right  So I look at her and I go  George Stephanopoulos, huh?  Yeah  I'm sure you're marrying that guy for his looks  Oh, oh  But he is a good-looking guy  But you know, like  He would just be some short idiot to her  Because she's like a money power  Yo, Jay Moore  They cut that out  They cut it out  Because she went to them  Because the audience literally went  Oh, my God  That is the meanest thing we've ever heard  That's still funny  Because I looked her up and down 
[02:34:30]  Like I was looking at her privates  And like her breasts  Like how you  Either how you look at someone  Before you have sex with them  Or before you knock them out  Uh-huh  And the crowd just went  Oh  And I said as I walked off  What the F was that?  And the producer came up to me  And said, could we use that?  And I said, what the F is that?  He goes, yeah  I said, please use it  I was mad  Yo, Jay Moore  Hold on, Dice  Yeah  What's wrong?  You know what's wrong  And he knows what's wrong  What?  What?  Jay  What was that about last night? 
[02:35:00]  On Conan O'Brien?  What, Jets?  Jay  Jay  He's a good friend of the Opie and Anthony show  I know what he is  And to show his love  He used one of our terms, yambes  I think it was an homage  It was an homage to the Opie and Anthony show  Of course, everyone knows that  We came up with the term yambag  Now it's mine  I let you guys slide  Now it's mine  You know why I let you guys slide?  Why?  Because you promote my shows  I got no reason  To let him slide  Uh-oh  But  Where are you playing?  I'll tell everyone I see today 
[02:35:30]  But he didn't steal the line, man  Yeah, he stole the line  And he knows he stole it  And he knew he was going to use it  He didn't steal it  Oh, man  You know you're out of the show business  That's a creepy move, Jay  I don't go for that stuff  You know when you're out of the show business, Lucy  You gotta call radio shows  To say you stole my line  No  That whole stupid bit about the sperm banks  That I got on album number two already  Oh, boy  And then you're using my newer lines  Because you had nothing to say  What was that about?  What newer lines?  And you come to the store  Like a real jerk-off 
[02:36:00]  And go, oh, are you going on?  I want to watch it  I didn't know you wanted to record  And use the stuff  First of all, I go on before you  Out of respect  You go on before me  Because I let you go on  If I'm not going to be able to talk  Jay Moore shows up at the comedy store  I want to go on  And he always goes  I'm not going to be able to talk  You know?  I go, he's the guy that plays Gilligan  In most movies  What the hell is that?  What's Jay Moore?  I don't go for that, Jay  I still don't know what you're talking about  You know what I'm talking about  Well, why don't you tell me 
[02:36:30]  Don't play the tough guy routine with me  No, I'm not going to talk  Unless I have a chance  All right, I'll let you talk  Because that pisses me off  You can't control yourself  Because you need freaking medication  You can't control yourself to not talk  First of all, I go on in front of you  At the comedy store  I know why you go on in front of me  You can't help yourself  You are so hungry for fame  Because you're so far out of the loop  That this is the only chance you get  To tap dance for America  Please, Jay  You know, you come to the store  You're an ass kisser 
[02:37:00]  Don't tell me my chance for fame  Like people know who you are  Please  You're the Gilligan of movies  Well, what are we talking about here?  That's who you are  I'd rather be a Gilligan in movies  You know what?  You know what?  It's good that you'd rather be a Gilligan  Because I would never settle  For being a Gilligan  I could work circles around you  I knew you were a creep  When you booked the Bad Boys show  And then canceled out Rascals  And just were going for the Westbury gig  So you could then continue  With the Caroline's gig  I knew you were a creep then 
[02:37:30]  I knew you were a creep  Coming to the comedy store  Trying to pick up on any chick  Coming out of the bathroom  I knew you were a creep then  Don't give me who you're a creep  Don't be a big shot with me  Dice, Dice, Dice  I want to hear what Jay has to say about that  No, he went on  He knows he's wrong  You're not letting Jay talk  You're not letting Jay talk  Dice, you're not letting Jay talk 
[02:38:00]  No, wait a minute  They're not letting Jay talk  This guy, let me tell you something  He's got a friend out in LA  He's a terrific comic  Ralph May  Okay  So he throws Jay a birthday party  And invites me to it  And I showed up  Not for Jay  Because Ralph was nice enough  To invite me  Okay  Jay doesn't even show up  For his birthday party  From his best friend  They tell me  He's got a big studio meeting  But yet his manager was there  His agents were there  All of a sudden  Studio meetings are being done 
[02:38:30]  Without the star's representatives there  He's a friggin' creep  This guy  Did you just call me a star?  You're Gilligan  Gilligan was a star in his own right  Now let Jay talk  No, he did the wrong thing  And he won't cop to it  And he thinks he's going to be a big shot  But when he comes toe-to-toe with me  He's going to crumble  And he knows it  When he sees me  We'll see what a big shot he is then  Pay-per-view  The birthday party that was thrown for me 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, you know about the birthday party  Oh, Christ  Put Dice on hold  How you snubbed him  And didn't show up to your own  All right, Dice, hold on  Hold on  Hold on  Because I can't  Jay can't  I can't take him  Because he's so ridiculous  And he's so retarded  Ralphie Mae  Told me  I'm having a barbecue  And he told my wife  Who's here  That guy  I could put you on the phone with her  If you'd like  And I don't think she has any reason  To lie to you guys  No, go ahead  He said  Why don't you come on down  I'm having a barbecue  On his own  He started to tell everybody  It was a birthday party for me 
[02:39:30]  He called Dice  And invited him  I have had conversations  With Ralph  It's Ralphie  Not Ralph, by the way  Ralphie Mae  Since then  It wasn't a birthday party  He just said that  To get people to go  He was the dummy  Not me  Right  Second of all  The Westbury Music Fair  I was honored to work with Dice  At Westbury Music Fair  To open for Dice  Out of a show of respect  What was last night  A show of respect  Why'd you cancel Rascals last night  Was that a show of respect  I was just about to say it  You're an opportunist 
[02:40:00]  You're a jerk-off guy  You're a heave  And that's what you are  Yo, they're both Jewish, right?  No, they're not  What are you calling me now?  Stop  Look  Will you call me?  You guys  I was just about to tell you  What happened with Westbury  But I couldn't  I know  What happened with Westbury  What happened  Hold on  Hold on  Hold on  What happened at Westbury  Jesus Christ  Westbury Music Fair  I agreed to do for  With Dice  Right  For Dice  Not for the money  Because it was less than  What I would normally get  If I did it  He says  I also want you to do Rascals 
[02:40:30]  I said  Definitely on Westbury  No on Rascals  Because why would I open  For you at Rascals  When I could sell out  20 shows in a row  There by myself  You guys understand that  Alright, sure  I'm on the road  I check my messages  I get a message from  Club Soda Kenny  Saying, Jay  We need an answer now  It's all or nothing  So I say  Thanks for making it easy for me  It's nothing  Uh huh  That's what happened  Okay  Alright  You tell me where  I'm the big shot here  Back to Opie  Alright  Back to Dice 
[02:41:00]  I heard Jay's explanation  Of why he didn't do  Rascals and Westbury  Because he was given  The all or nothing  Ultimatum  Forget about that  That's not all or nothing  You were proven wrong  What time  I just proved you wrong  So now you just told me wrong  You're a scumbag  What are you talking about  I'm a scumbag  Look in the mirror  Look in the mirror  I get in the coffin  Die  You know, Jay  You're going to run into me  And you're not going to be a big shot  I get in the coffin  I could promise that to you  Die, I get in the coffin 
[02:41:30]  Oh my god  You know, you just did  Sealed your own  I wouldn't be that way  Defending myself  That's why you're saying  Die  I get in the coffin  You got nothing to say  Die, he pretty much had an answer  For what you were saying  I just want to know  He had no answer  He went on a show  He did material that's not his  You know what I mean  He's a little kiss-ass  He did your voice though  He comes to the comedy store  Trying to pick up anything  Coming out of a girl's bathroom  Yeah  Remember me  I was elegant to Tom Cruise 
[02:42:00]  In that movie  Remember  Jesus Christ  The problem is that I'm  You come meet me, Jay  And you talk to me  Face to face like that  Let's see you be a big shot then  Yo, Dicey gave me  I want to see when you show up  At the store again  Because I'm telling you  That's where I'll be  You come  You come meet me now  And you say what you're saying  On the radio  You know what  I want to see that happen  Well, I can't even get my point across  Because you're going to  You have no point  He just made a couple of good points  I just threw you wrong  He made a couple of good points 
[02:42:30]  You didn't do me wrong with anything  You're a zero  That's it  Then why are you calling  To call me a zero  Because I'm pissed off  When a zero goes on  And does my material  That's why  When you go on a show  And do my material  That's wrong  And you know it  And you're trying to defend  Something that you can't defend  I said this is great  But if you want to tell me  Die and get in the coffin  You come  You know where I'm at  I'll be waiting for you  Believe me  And you're going to have to  Walk into me  Believe me  And that's a problem 
[02:43:00]  You don't want in your life  Because with this energy  Between us floating around  I would have to confront you  To talk to you face to face  You will have to confront me  Believe me  And I want to see  I just agreed with you  I want to see  If you just stand with me  With nobody around  I just agreed with you  You stand with me  With nobody around  And you tell me  Die and get in the coffin  And then we're going to  See what happens  And then we're going to  See who's in the coffin  We're going to see  What a big shot you are  You don't scare me  You ain't nothing to me  Believe me  Maybe you can pick on  The girl from the 
[02:43:30]  From Regis' show  You know  Pick on that girl  I want to see you  Stand with me  Like a man  Which you're not  You know  And tell me  What you just said  On the radio  I want to see you  Do that to me  I think I hit a sore spot  With Dice  Hey you didn't hit  A sore spot  Hey Dice  You did the wrong thing  You don't cop to it  Once again  No I did  I just  You know what I mean  Stick to being  Gilligan's in film  Don't get on a comedy  Hey I'm trying
