<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony "After ONA Live" show, hosted by Sam Roberts, began with a discussion sparked by Guy Fieri's vodka-spraying incident.  Sam expressed concern about the potential dangers, particularly for those with allergies or recovering alcoholics. Eric vehemently denied the existence of alcohol allergies, igniting a heated debate with callers.  Mike from Philly claimed to have experienced anaphylactic shock from alcohol, while Aaron from White Plains offered a more balanced perspective.  Dr. Steve, a regular "Weird Medicine" caller, explained that while true alcohol allergies are rare, severe reactions are possible.  This segment was marked by frequent interruptions and a volatile exchange between Sam and Eric, punctuated by insults.

The show also featured a prank call, possibly linked to Ian Halperin, where the caller claimed to have obtained the show's number from Sirius XM customer service.  Roland, a show staffer, recounted his involvement in Opie's hurried departure from Sirius XM, revealing he'd been instructed not to discuss details on air.  This was followed by a discussion of Opie and Anthony's confrontation with Sirius XM executives after their early exit.

Further segments included a call from Kenny recounting Sam drinking beer from a shoe at Opie's wedding, prompting speculation about Sam's drinking habits.  A phone screener had a frustrated outburst with a caller.  Promotional segments included announcements of Troy's upcoming DJ gigs and Bill Burr's impending appearance with a major announcement.  Finally, the possibility of having Jersey Shore guests back on the show, excluding Snooki, was discussed. The show maintained a highly informal, often vulgar, and chaotic atmosphere throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Alright!  Still here.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Obviously we heard before the little break there  that Anthony was not able to make it out unscathed.  Even though he left the show early,  we tried to run interference  and Anthony still got cornered by the bosses. 
[00:00:30]  I don't know if Opie did or not,  but before we can really even answer that,  we've got to go to the hotline.  Hello, you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Yeah.  You have the number of the 80s, please?  The number of the 80s?  Yeah.  No, I don't have the number of the 80s.  You could tune in to Channel 8. 
[00:01:00]  No, the phone number.  Right.  Well, I mean,  if you go to Channel 8,  they would probably tell you  what the phone number was there.  On the radio?  Right.  Huh?  Yeah.  Oh,  Excuse me.  I'm at the virus?  Yes, you're on the virus.  I don't,  in my radio at Montreal.  I have listened to your station online, 
[00:01:30]  on my phone.  Yeah.  So how did you get this number?  What?  How did you get this phone number to call?  I have,  excuse my English,  I don't speak good English.  Of course.  I have the number of the 17,  and the 17,  I have, 
[00:02:00]  I have,  think,  What are you talking about?  At the 9,  the number,  the 9,  oh,  oh,  phew.  Yeah,  no,  where did you find this phone number?  At,  at XM.  Who at XM gave you this phone number?  Uh,  customer service.  Gave you this phone number?  Yeah.  For what?  Uh,  because,  uh, 
[00:02:30]  for the,  for the 90s.  For the 90s.  Eric.  Yeah.  Is that possible?  Um.  Probably not,  right?  No,  because this isn't our main hotline,  but we have some other lines that we have reserved,  and this is one of those other lines,  so.  But it's probably not a similar number to the 90s.  I don't believe so.  Well,  where is Ian Halperin from?  He's from Canada.  Is he,  what province?  Quebec. 
[00:03:00]  How did you know where Ian Halperin was from?  Oh,  excuse me,  okay.  Well,  guess who figured out the mystery?  Am I good,  Eric,  or am I good?  Um,  yeah,  you're good.  I'm,  I'm looking at the phone number of what called,  and I was looking at Ian's number,  and they're not the same.  Well,  I think Ian probably just had one of his guys call up,  and that was his idea.  I,  I was hoping it would go somewhere.  Maybe I could freak out,  like, 
[00:03:30]  uh,  what's his name?  Mike,  from Mike and the Mad Dog.  That was in reference to an earlier conversation we had today.  This is after Opie and Anthony live.  I see Roland down there.  I know Troy's probably listening.  Troy,  tell Roland if he could come up here.  He's talking to Jim,  and what appears to be Rob Cross,  he just stumbled.  Uh,  now he's laughing at himself,  I think.  My eye,  my vision is not,  uh,  what it used to be.  I'm getting a little older. 
[00:04:00]  I hope I didn't break up a major conversation,  though,  because Roland was supposed to follow Opie downstairs,  and it looks like Rob Cross and Jim are walking up here together.  I wonder if Rob's going to crack a mic today.  Here comes Roland.  Roland,  I,  did you stumble when you were coming,  walking up or something?  What happened there?  Stupid scenario.  All this box,  I knocked it down,  and I kept on walking.  So it was all,  it spilled CDs all over the place.  Are you happy about that?  Fuck yeah.  Now,  uh,  you were supposed to be following Opie out,  right?  Yes.  How did that,  how did the Opie adventure go? 
[00:04:30]  Um,  I was told we're not talking about that anymore on the air.  By who?  You're losing,  uh,  more steam than,  uh,  Ian Halpern's prank call.  Ooh.  Did you hear?  No.  It was somebody,  uh,  put on by air.  So did he,  did Opie make it out okay?  He made it out okay.  He,  he,  he got out right on time.  Well,  I told Anthony it's because he,  Anthony seems much more approachable than Opie.  No,  it was a 50 50 shot.  Like they caught Anthony on the left. 
[00:05:00]  So they figured the way on the left.  So you think they were still waiting on the left?  Yeah.  What was his strategy?  Running very quickly.  Why do you have the video camera?  To videotape his escape.  Wow.  And apparently you can't film in the building.  You can't?  No,  they scream.  Who said that?  Um,  like the guys who scream,  the guys who scream downstairs,  the security people.  Oh,  you went all the way down with him?  Yeah.  You're like,  here you go,  brother.  And he ran out the building.  He just stopped from the camera.  He's a maniac because he can't, 
[00:05:30]  I guess,  film in a lobby here.  You're wearing Guy Fieri's t-shirt.  Yes.  It was a delicious sauce that he gave us.  What are the,  what are the odds that we can get Guy Fieri back in here to apologize to me?  For what?  Because.  For your stupid palate?  No,  no,  no,  no,  no.  My palate,  you can.  Oh,  for the vodka?  That's right.  Welcome brother for alcohol.  Well,  I talked about this on,  on this show briefly last week.  And then on the Saturday show,  I talked about it more at length because the longer this goes on,  the more I think that you don't, 
[00:06:00]  when a person tells you they don't drink.  That's funny.  You don't spray alcohol into their mouth.  That is the greatest.  Yeah,  but what happens if I had a reason?  That's funnier.  That's not funnier.  It is funny.  I mean,  you know,  he,  that,  that seems beyond watching me spit up steak.  I think it's funny.  You do?  I do.  Well,  why don't you get Guy Fieri back in here?  Because I would like to talk to him about this.  No.  Why no?  Because you're going to upset the man. 
[00:06:30]  He's going to cook for us again.  Eric,  am I out of line?  Yeah,  a little bit.  Why?  Because,  go with it.  Go with what?  It's not that big a deal.  But it is,  it could have been.  How?  Because what if I was either allergic or recovering?  You can't be allergic to alcohol.  What are you talking about?  You can't be allergic to alcohol.  Yeah,  you can.  You absolutely can,  Eric.  Especially a vodka with the wheat and a,  or the,  You can be allergic to any alcohol.  Or the corn.  Bullshit.  What's bullshit?  It sounds like bullshit being allergic to alcohol. 
[00:07:00]  Well,  it's not.  That sounds like allergic,  you can be allergic to peanut butter.  You can be allergic to alcohol.  Yeah,  you can be allergic to alcohol.  That's bullshit too.  Oh my God,  Eric,  you're impossible.  But what happens if I had a reason  for not drinking?  Wouldn't that have made him an asshole?  But we know your history.  No,  he doesn't.  No.  And they didn't put him up to it.  No,  if,  if he was going to,  everybody knew he was going to do that.  If they knew you had a history.  No,  no,  no,  no.  If he was going to do that to Jim,  everybody would have stopped him  because they knew Jim had a history.  No,  I thought it was water.  I'm not mad at people for not, 
[00:07:30]  for not stopping it.  And I don't think everybody knew anything,  but the point was that he did it.  Not that nobody stopped him.  I loved it.  Oh,  well.  I mean,  that,  that would be the issue as to whether or not  that was an asshole move.  Like,  he wasn't looking around for approval.  He just went ahead and did it.  It was funny.  Yeah,  that's fine that it was funny,  but do you not see the point?  I,  I think you're making a big deal out of nothing.  Let me turn these mics off  so I don't,  uh,  pick up whisper conversations  that are private. 
[00:08:00]  I understand why you're upset,  but on the other hand,  it really wasn't that big a deal.  But it could have been.  How?  How could it have been?  You wouldn't have been hooked on alcohol  for what was about a teaspoon,  a tablespoon of vodka.  If I was allergic or recovering,  it would have been a major deal.  Exactly.  If you,  not allergic,  but if you were in recovery.  Yes,  if I was allergic,  it would have been an even bigger deal  because I would have had a medical reaction.  That's bullshit.  How is it?  Bullshit.  Who's allergic to vodka?  Anybody who's allergic, 
[00:08:30]  people,  human beings.  No.  People who have vodka,  alcohol allergies.  No.  No.  There's no alcohol allergies.  Where did,  you're an idiot,  Eric.  You really are,  I mean.  Whatever.  This is not a big deal.  You're not in recovery.  I didn't say I was.  No,  but if you said,  you were saying if you were.  Right.  He didn't know whether I was or not.  Everybody knew he was doing it.  They would have stopped it  if you were in recovery.  I didn't ask anybody to stop it.  I asked,  what about him doing it?  He showed us what he was doing 
[00:09:00]  before he did it.  He didn't ask for approval.  I was watching him.  No.  He just showed it  and then everyone nodded yes.  That is asking for approval.  You just said he didn't.  Not on the air.  No,  he didn't do that at all.  He did,  there's no,  I didn't,  I was watching Guy  and the host the entire time.  You're making the scenario up.  I was on the other side of the table.  People saw and knew.  Everybody's going crazy over this.  Hello,  you're on the after show.  Hello.  What's up,  buddy?  Hey,  Mike from Philly.  I'm actually allergic to alcohol. 
[00:09:30]  Okay.  You see,  Eric,  it's a real allergy.  You understand,  me and Mike from Philly now  both say it's a real allergy.  All right,  explain it to me then.  If you're allergic to alcohol,  what does it do?  Depending on the type of alcohol,  depending on the ingredients  of the alcohol,  you can go into anaphylactic shock.  Does that count as being serious,  Eric?  I don't know.  I'm not buying it.  Why don't you just admit you're wrong?  No,  because I don't buy it.  Why would Mike from Philly?  I don't like those who are allergic  to like bee stings  or things like that. 
[00:10:00]  You go into anaphylactic shock.  It happened to me three times.  One from a dessert  that had alcohol in it  that I was not aware of.  Punch that.  Thank you,  Mike.  He was just making that up,  Eric?  Be serious.  I've never heard  of being allergic to alcohol.  Well,  he just told you that he was.  Yeah,  but people could say  whatever the fuck they want  and we're supposed to believe it.  Why would that be something  that anybody may have?  Because it's this show.  They'll just go with  whatever flows going.  Oh my God.  You're on After Open Anthony Live, 
[00:10:30]  315.  Hey,  the problem with your argument  is you're not allergic  and you're not an alcoholic.  Stop being a woman.  Thank you.  Is there an allergy  to alcohol that exists?  Yeah,  yeah,  fine,  but you're not allergic.  You didn't fucking puff up  and die much to our just pain.  I didn't say,  I said that the problem  was that it was an asshole move  because he didn't know.  Only to you,  the rest of us thought  it was hilarious.  Well,  I didn't ask  what the rest of you thought.  I said,  was it an asshole move or not? 
[00:11:00]  Well,  you get mad,  I mean,  you get mad at Eric  when he doesn't buck up  for the show,  which is very rare,  by the way,  and this one little time  you take a teaspoon of alcohol  and you're going to bitch about it  for three fucking days?  I do everything for the show.  Everything I'm asked,  I've always done.  No,  you didn't eat the steak,  you pussy.  Yes,  I did.  No,  you didn't.  What did I do then?  You put it in your mouth  and spit it out.  Oh my God.  These people,  Eric,  you're having a bad influence  on them.  Line six.  My mom's really allergic 
[00:11:30]  to alcohol.  She'll puff all up  and break out in a rash  and I am.  Is that true?  You said that  with a very strange voice.  I do?  Yeah,  you just have a weird voice.  I'd never heard that before.  Oh.  Eric,  did you hear that?  I don't know where he is now.  He's gone.  All right.  Thank you,  buddy.  Yes,  you,  914.  Hey.  What's up,  buddy?  First of all,  Iraq,  Iraq, 
[00:12:00]  you're a douche  because everybody knows  that alcohol is a common allergy.  Exactly.  Yeah,  it's not a crazy...  Just because he has no problems  putting everything in his mouth  doesn't mean other people don't.  He's exactly right.  I don't know where he went.  Thank you,  sir.  However,  Sam,  I will say this in the end.  You are wrong  because if you really did have an allergy  or were really recovering,  that's what you say.  But you think that,  you think it's not,  it's not bad on principle? 
[00:12:30]  No,  no,  no.  I think that if you were in that situation  and you really had an allergy  or you were really sick,  you say to the guy,  hey,  listen,  man,  I have an allergy.  I can't.  Or,  hey,  listen,  I'm sick.  Like Jimmy did.  And Jimmy said,  I'm recovering.  All right.  Well,  see,  you speak like a human being.  Where are you from in Westchester?  White Plains.  I can accept that.  White Plains.  What's your name?  Aaron.  Aaron in White Plains.  See,  that's something I can accept.  Unlike E-Rock,  I can actually have a conversation 
[00:13:00]  with a person.  Thank you,  Aaron.  Why don't you know?  Now,  who's this?  Who's on the hotline?  Where did you,  where did E-Rock go?  I'm on the phones here,  dude.  Well,  you don't have to be on the phones.  I got it.  Hello.  Hello.  Who's this?  Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve,  will you please tell Eric  that there's a pot,  it's possible for a human being  to be allergic to alcohol?  He thinks everybody's calling up  and bullshitting 
[00:13:30]  that nobody is allergic to alcohol.  Okay.  Can you give me a little context?  Okay.  I said,  remember,  were you listening to the show  on Thursday  when Guy Fieri was in here?  Uh,  I missed that.  All right.  I was listening on Thursday,  but I missed that.  Okay.  It's no problem.  Trust me,  Dr. Steve,  we know you're a fan.  You don't have to say,  I swear I was listening.  It's not that I wasn't listening.  Um,  so Guy Fieri was in  and they did,  Opie and Anthony said,  oh,  Sam,  you know,  eat the steak  and I said,  I'm going to gag on it  and they said,  eat it anyway.  So I ate the steak  and then I gagged on the steak 
[00:14:00]  and spit it out  and then Guy said,  uh,  here,  Sam,  do you want some water?  I said,  yeah,  sure.  And they sprayed it in my mouth  but it was vodka,  not water.  Okay.  So I spit it out  and I said,  uh,  whatever,  they got me  and as,  uh,  as I was thinking about it  more and more  over the past several days,  I became enraged  because I thought that  if there was an issue,  for instance,  I was,  uh,  recovering  or I was allergic,  then that would be 
[00:14:30]  a complete asshole move  so just the fact  that he didn't know  whether I was recovering  or allergic  makes it  a complete asshole move.  Yep.  Eric's response to that was  you can't be allergic  to alcohol,  it doesn't exist.  Okay.  Here's the thing.  You can have  reactions to alcohol  and you can have,  there are people  who have severe reactions  to alcohol  where they will flush  and,  uh,  get headaches  and,  uh,  these kinds of things.  It's actually not 
[00:15:00]  an allergy  but in the lay,  sort of lay terms,  people will say,  well,  I'm allergic to alcohol.  So you can have  severe reactions to it  but they're not allergic  in the sense  that it's mediated  by antibodies  that,  um,  you know,  are roaming around  in your bloodstream  which is a true allergy.  But like,  people have reactions  that,  like you said,  the lay person would say  it's an allergic reaction.  Yes,  that's right.  They would say  it's an allergic reaction  and you can have  a severe reaction 
[00:15:30]  to it  but it's,  um,  it's not a true allergy.  So in one sense  you're right  but in the technical sense  the alcohol molecule  is so small  that you can't actually  develop an antibody  to it  so you can't actually  be quote unquote  allergic to it.  But it's,  I mean,  it's,  yeah,  it's a,  it's a,  it's not a cool thing  to,  to,  uh,  expose someone  to alcohol  against their will.  Well,  I think that's a,  or Tylenol  or fecal matter 
[00:16:00]  or anything like that.  Right.  You know,  it's just sort of a,  yeah,  it's an asshole move.  Or to,  uh,  you know,  put something in their mouth  that they didn't ask for.  Yeah,  and that's coming from a doctor.  Like a penis.  Yeah,  that is.  Um,  Eric,  yeah,  are you counting that  as a victory in your column?  No,  but it explains a lot  because I knew  there wasn't an allergy.  He's right.  All right.  Reactions,  fine.  But that,  but you did not have enough  to cause a reaction. 
[00:16:30]  You had the equivalent  of what was less than a shot.  Okay,  well,  that guy,  the guy who was on the phone  a minute ago  said that he went,  he had a reaction  based on a dessert  that had alcohol in it.  But the alcohol's cooked off  in a dessert.  Right.  Is the guy on the,  So there's no alcohol,  really.  You got the flavoring,  but it's not the alcohol.  So you're saying  that he was allergic  to something else  in the dessert  that he's unaware of?  Quite possibly.  Dr. Steve,  if he has,  if he's prone  to getting reactions  to alcohol 
[00:17:00]  that the lay person  would call allergies.  I mean,  Eric's right.  Usually you'll cook  off the alcohol,  but there are some things  like rum cakes  and stuff  where people just  pour alcohol on it.  So, I mean,  I wasn't there,  so I'm not discounting  what the guy said.  Fair enough.  Right, yeah.  You know,  it's possible.  There are desserts  that actually still  have alcohol in them.  And it doesn't take much.  The people that have  this flushing thing,  and it tends to be genetic,  it does not take  that much alcohol  to set them off.  You see, Eric,  it doesn't take much. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  It doesn't matter.  It's not cool  to put alcohol  in somebody's mouth  when they're not expecting it.  But, Steve,  we also explained to Sam,  because the other part  of his argument  was that what if  he was recovering,  is that we saw  he was going to do that  before he put it  in Sam's mouth.  If Sam was in recovery,  we wouldn't have  allowed him to do that.  Right, right.  But I think that's bullshit,  though,  because I saw  none of them nod,  and Roland just said 
[00:18:00]  he didn't know  he was going to.  He picked up  the little container  that had the water,  that you thought  was water in there,  and had vodka on it,  showed it to Ope Ant  and Jim on the other  side of the room,  and then ran over  and squirted it  in your mouth.  That's fine.  I dropped the,  me and Aaron  from White Plains  already came to a  compromise on that  argument.  It's done.  This was more,  this turned into  Eric insisting  that people don't.  Mark Zito has  an electric reaction  to alcohol as well.  Does he?  Yeah, that's what he said.  I've seen him drink.  I know, but you say  he pushes through, though. 
[00:18:30]  He's bullshitting.  You don't push through.  If you have an  allergic reaction.  No, yeah, you can.  You can.  No, that's right.  There are people  who have the  flushing response,  and they're  alcoholics,  some of them,  and, you know,  they drink like crazy,  but they do just  push through it.  Oh, my God.  Fadey, Sam.  Well, thank you  for educating us  today, Dr. Steve.  You're welcome.  And when can we all  hear Weird Medicine  again?  Oh, Saturday nights  at 10 p.m.  after special delivery  starring Sam and Dave.  Thank you so much, 
[00:19:00]  Dr. Steve.  Thanks, guys.  I don't know  even who was  right or wrong  in that whole  conversation anymore.  That thing just  degenerated into  nonsense, Eric.  See, from Dr. Steve,  I'll trust his answer.  The listener's calling in,  I'm not going to buy it.  One guy said he went  into shock.  You say bullshit?  People call and say shit  all the time.  All right.  Now everybody's calling  in to be like,  fuck you,  but we're done.  I'm done with the  conversation.  It'll be 50-50.  They'll hate me.  They'll hate you.  Can I say something real quick?  Yeah.  Now they'll hate Troy.  You're a b-  Yeah, exactly.  Troy, go ahead. 
[00:19:30]  So that way,  I took the heat off Eric.  Yeah.  Now you take the heat off me.  I just think you're being  a bit of a pussy.  You think so?  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah.  Wow.  I mean, it's just a splash,  dude.  It was a splash.  Yeah, really?  It wasn't even a shot.  It's just not the amount  that's to debate.  But I mean,  it's just,  dude, you work on  the Opie and Anthony show.  You know what I mean?  Like you had a splash  of alcohol in there.  It's not,  I'm not debating the amount.  I didn't say I had  three drinks in my mouth. 
[00:20:00]  So are you going to drink down  on your wedding and eat toast?  Yeah.  I mean, obviously,  I've degenerated into an alcoholic  over the weekend.  That's what I was getting at.  Welcome, brother.  Because of this.  Well, I mean,  you could have a lawsuit  on your hands.  And that's the next step.  That's what I'm working on here.  You guys got to let me  get to my point.  Troy, obviously,  you and Eric have  qualms with the callers.  Eric doesn't believe them  when they have  reactions to alcohol  and you just  scream at them.  And by the way,  that caller that called  in about the 80s, 
[00:20:30]  he's done that to me before.  The hotline?  Yeah.  Oh, so he's calling  in the hotline now.  We only got two minutes.  Yes, after Opie and Anthony.  Yes, it's Kenny.  Oh, thank God.  How are you, Club Stoner?  I witnessed you  drink alcohol.  alcohol.  Yeah?  That's correct.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  Why did you say,  oh, yeah, Eric?  I remembered this,  what he's talking about. 
[00:21:00]  What are you?  Oh.  All right?  Yeah, but did I,  that,  yes, I drank  beer out of a shoe  at Opie's wedding.  No, you're a problem drinker.  Oh.  So you're saying  that now you're seeing  this downward spiral  right in front of your face?  Yeah, yeah,  you're in denial.  Well, I don't think  I have a problem.  Of course,  people with problems  don't want to admit it.  Kenny,  you give me a lot  to think about. 
[00:21:30]  Exactly.  All right,  well, have a nice day anyway.  Take the first step  of the 12 steps.  Which is what?  I don't know.  I don't have a problem.  You do have a problem, Kenny.  I just don't think  12 steps will solve it.  Oh, exactly.  Have a great day.  Wait, wait,  you forgot something.  What?  Is Club Soda Kenny  on Facebook?  Is that in it?  Thank you.  You're welcome, Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny 
[00:22:00]  on Facebook.  And I wanted to play  this for everybody.  This is when  a phone screener  has had enough.  Fucking man,  and man up  and tell him yourself.  Or don't bother calling.  Because I don't give a fuck.  I don't give a fuck.  Then go!  If you have a problem  with them,  then tell them.  I wish...  And he just hung up on him.  I wish that Roland 
[00:22:30]  had been taping that  from the beginning.  Yeah.  Because Eric  throws on the microphone  and I get to hear you  just screaming  at these people.  Are you fed up with them?  Well,  you get to the point  where you're just like,  you've got to be kidding me.  You know what I mean?  Like,  why do you call up  and yell at me  about Opie and Anthony  and then just hang...  You're just telling  the phone screener.  Like,  I don't care, dude.  So you don't know who...  And the guy  that called the hotline  asking for...  He's done that a couple times.  Does he kind of make a request  as the 80s line?  He's got to be friends 
[00:23:00]  with Ian Halperin  because how else  would he get the number?  Yeah,  I don't know.  I don't know.  And that's right in the peak  of your madness  where you're trying  to take calls,  take calls,  and then this guy,  you're like,  oh,  hotline,  this is an emergency.  You pick it up  and it's this guy.  Yeah.  I mean,  it just goes on and on.  You know,  it's just whatever.  It's fine.  Is it?  I mean,  what are my options?  Shit or get off the pot,  I guess.  Yeah,  I mean,  it's like they think  that this is the best position  for me,  you know?  So that's what I do.  Did you get your Pro Tools yet? 
[00:23:30]  Eric,  don't bring up ugly things  like that.  Like what?  Well,  you would have known  if you had headphones on.  So.  Eric,  are you and I  on good terms again?  Yeah,  I'm fine.  We got really ugly there  for a second,  me and you.  No,  you just wanted to complain.  Wow.  You said alcohol allergies  were not real.  They're not.  They're not real.  What?  Because technically  it's not an allergy?  Yes.  And that's your,  that's your argument?  People can have reaction  to things,  but that is not an allergy.  That's not what, 
[00:24:00]  you're not allergic to alcohol.  You're driving me crazy,  Eric,  but you're a good person.  But the fact of the matter  is you are not  allergic to it.  I know.  And you're blowing this  way out of proportion.  Right now he's on  Web Dumb MD.  Web Dumb MD.  All right,  well,  I know you do,  Roland.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Bill Burr calling in  the show tomorrow  with a major announcement.  So that's something  we can all get excited about.  Unfortunately,  he can't be here,  but he's in L.A., 
[00:24:30]  right?  Yeah,  he's in L.A.  Yeah,  but he'll be here  I think on the 22nd.  And you heard it  at the end of the show,  Roland looking to get  some of the Jersey Shore  people back in here.  Yep,  they'll be coming  in the next few weeks.  Except for Snooki,  who is not coming in  because she  is a twatteroo.  Good to know.  This has been  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Troy,  are you DJing?  Yes,  I'm DJing tonight  at 675 Bar  in the West Village  and tomorrow  at the Tally Ho  in Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania  for music fests  going on.  Come on out. 
[00:25:00]  Troyquan.com.  So get in your car  and just go to all his gigs.  Follow him around  like the Grateful Dead.  Buy Troy free drinks  so you see if he has  alcohol poisoning.  No alcohol poisoning here.  Buy me as many as you want.  Test Troy's allergies,  will you?  Yeah.  It's Ron and Fez  coming up next.  Bitches,  give it up for Troy.  We'll see you tomorrow. </pre>
