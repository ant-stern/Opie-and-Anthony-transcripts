<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show opened with discussions about plastic surgery among radio personalities, an intern with mono potentially contaminating the office coffee, and a prank call campaign targeting Rich Voss.  Comedian Jimmy Norton called in, detailing his negative experience with Ellen DeGeneres and the challenges of entertaining his family during their visit to Los Angeles.  The hosts engaged in self-deprecating humor about their own appearances.  Significant airtime was devoted to criticizing radio host Dave Rossi, playing a clip of him seemingly flustered on air, possibly due to Opie and Anthony's listening in.  Caller Kim provided a marital update, sharing an anecdote about his wife.  Rich Voss's marriage and his tendency to discuss his wife extensively were also discussed. Patrice O'Neal was a studio guest, participating in discussions about a mine disaster and other news stories.

The show took a graphic turn with a detailed description of kidney stones and their expulsion, followed by a caller, Dana, explaining the origin of her name.  This led to more banter, including repeated use of racial slurs by the hosts towards Patrice.  A 911 call about a sinking car was played, highlighting the dispatcher's calm demeanor in contrast to the caller's panic.  Other humorous and outrageous 911 calls were discussed, including one where a dispatcher jokingly offered to "shoot" a caller's child, followed by the caller's angry reaction.  Rich Voss called in again, discussing a recent radio appearance and the constant attempts by listeners to contact him, mentioning a bit he did about his wife.  More racial slurs were directed at Patrice, sparking a debate about Anthony's alleged racism, with examples of past comments being discussed.

The "finger in the Wendy's chili" extortion scam was discussed, followed by a segment on escaping a sinking car from Good Morning America.  Further racial slurs and banter about Patrice’s family life and sobriety continued, focusing on his MySpace top eight friends and lack of black people. Patrice agreed to add more Black people to his top eight for Black History Month. Voss left to do another interview.  The show then played several top ten country songs, prompting humorous commentary from the hosts, who lacked familiarity with the genre. Their interpretations of the songs were often vulgar and sexually explicit, with more racial slurs directed at Patrice. A caller from Alabama criticized their mockery of country music. Patrice fell on the floor towards the end of this segment.

Further analysis of top ten country songs continued, with the hosts and a caller, Amanda, speculating on the meanings of songs by Tim McGraw, Brad Paisley, Billy Currington, Trace Adkins, and Carrie Underwood.  Their interpretations were often comically inaccurate and sexually explicit, with extensive use of racial slurs during the discussion of "Honky Tonk Badonkadonk".  Women from the "Bowdog Lingerie Bowl" appeared as guests, with one guest initially hesitant and wearing a winter coat over her lingerie, becoming the subject of offensive commentary, ultimately leading her to leave the studio. This led to apologies and continued promotion of the Lingerie Bowl.

The following segment focused heavily on Danielle Gamba, a Lingerie Bowl participant.  The hosts and Patrice criticized her demeanor and reactions, speculating on the lack of female guests.  Her website, age, and origin were discussed.  O'Neal made particularly harsh and offensive comments. The conversation shifted to Howard Stern, his potential show reduction, and  Opie and Anthony’s own show content, including a story about an unexpected childbirth and segments about American Idol, focusing on a poorly performing, gender non-conforming contestant.  A rewritten Whitney Houston song was played.  Callers praised Patrice and the "It's Raining Stuff" bit.  The show briefly touched upon "Skating with Celebrities" and another awkward American Idol contestant.  Future plans, including appearances by other comedians, were mentioned. The "Midget Sighting of the Day" segment ended the show.

[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  Thank you.  We stink.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, come on. 
[00:05:30]  I've seen the cops knocking the truck window out, and I thought they were giving the man UPS. 
[00:06:00]  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  Yeah!  I love Laughing Yoga Guy. 
[00:06:30]  Is that what that is?  Yeah.  I didn't know where that came from.  Laughing yoga guy.  If you want to stay healthy, you've got to laugh.  Obviously, I didn't know where it ended either.  Ah, whatever.  War.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  There's going to be train wrecks every day in this program because we take massive chances on a daily basis.  Oh, absolutely. 
[00:07:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony program.  The ONA virus spreading across America thanks to XM, Satellite, Radio.  Right you are.  You're listening to the pioneers of Satellite Radio.  You're listening to two guys that don't have nose jobs.  You're listening to two guys that are smart enough not to have daughters.  You're listening to two guys.  Did you have lipo under your chin?  Not yet.  No? 
[00:07:30]  I'm all good.  I don't think I would do that plastic surgery thing.  No.  A lot of radio guys end up doing the plastic surgery thing, which is really strange to me because you're on the radio.  If I was going to, I would have years ago.  Please.  But thank you, my fucking Sicilian father, for this schnoz.  And, you know, what am I going to do?  You know, I can almost see it if you're doing like a TV thing.  Yeah.  And you want your career to go on and maybe a little longer.  Yeah.  And you're not going to get into like the Joan Rivers area of plastic surgery. 
[00:08:00]  Mm-hmm.  I get it to a point.  But if you do a radio show, why are you getting plastic surgery?  That's...  Unless you're some fucking narcissistic egomaniac.  I think it comes down to no matter how successful you are, you're just not happy with yourself.  You two got to stay cute.  I'm going to try.  That's your thing.  I'm going to try to stay cute.  You should be the legitimately cute radio guys that aren't these kind of good looking dudes that try to be doing it looking or just ultra horribly ugly motherfuckers. 
[00:08:30]  You should be a new genre of really cute motherfuckers.  Well, we're too thin, guys.  Yeah, that is very rare.  We are a rare find in radio because we are thin guys.  That's right.  Everyone in radio is overweight to some capacity.  Well, they sit down and do nothing, but you got a rollerblader.  You got fucking 52 colonoscopy man over here that got to stay alive. 
[00:09:00]  Just eat a bagel and one meal when I get home of broccoli and a piece of chicken.  Oh, and they bagged a bagel boy.  Shut up, dude.  You wanted to eat like me today.  I want to eat like you today.  I was in the office and Ben calls and goes, hey, well, Ben gets a hold of me and goes, hey, Patrice is on the line.  He wants to eat like you.  What kind of cereal do you eat?  I know you get go lean and Kashi, but it's like I don't want to push it.  No, Norton's the Kashi guy.  Norton's on the line, by the way.  Jimmy.  Hey, Jim. 
[00:09:30]  Maybe he's not on the line.  It doesn't sound like the phone is even down.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it down on my end.  Jimmy.  Hi, old.  Hi, Ed.  There he is.  Wait, wait.  Eric was pointing at something.  Program wasn't on.  Oh, that wasn't on today?  Ah.  All right.  We're all fixed.  Yeah, we're all fixed.  How's our little lamb?  I'm good.  I'm going to have some neck lipo while I'm out here in Los Angeles.  Yeah, you're going to do that?  I could see you doing something like that.  I actually could, too.  The HBO show hits, like, gets picked up again. 
[00:10:00]  It gets a buzz about it.  Jimmy, you'll be the first one running in.  What do I do about this neck?  You've got to suck the fat out.  How do you make a chin with that plastic shit?  I look like a fucking bullfrog.  I just can't do anything about my fat neck, and it's really depressing.  I mean, there's nothing about me that's particularly good-looking and TV-ish, but, I mean, that  is really unsightly, and there's just nothing I can do to get rid of it.  I don't think they have a procedure for that.  No, they don't.  It's called a shotgun. 
[00:10:30]  You've got to be comfy in your own skin, Jimmy.  I know.  I know.  How's your chest, little sweetie?  Are you doing okay?  I'm 10 days into this stupid flu.  I'm much better.  I'm good enough to broadcast, but it was a bad week last week.  Yeah, I know.  It was worse for me.  How many instant messages can you get that go, hey, did you give Ope AIDS?  LOL.  Oh, I know.  Well, how about this one?  We find out that one of our interns was walking around here with Mono.  Which one? 
[00:11:00]  I guess...  Emilio.  Emilio.  Emilio.  Which one's that?  I don't even know.  They say they rattle off their names, and I'm like, I can't even conjure up an image  in my mind of what Emilio looked like.  That wasn't the big one.  The big sweet boy, was it?  With the big...  I don't know.  Than just put his hat on sideways as a little helpful hint of who it was.  He had like fucking Armand DeSante hair.  Yeah, I know exactly who he was.  He did look sickly all the time.  And it turns out he was here with Mono.  It's like, great. 
[00:11:30]  Good.  Thank you.  Huh?  Is that contagious, like without touching?  Is that contagious?  Is Ebola contagious?  That is like the most contagious thing.  Yeah, Mono is pretty contagious.  But they say you can only get it through saliva.  Well, that's good.  He was only handling our food and coffee.  Yeah, he was licking the rim of everyone's coffee cups and putting them back.  No, what did we say yesterday?  He was sucking on the Starbucks coffee nozzle.  Yeah, he was just shoving it in his mouth and hitting espresso. 
[00:12:00]  Hey, really fast, I just got an instant feedback from Fast Freddy in Jamaica Station.  Rich Voss is about to be on 100.7.  Carlson and McKenzie in Boston.  Please have a Boston listener eavesdrop on Rich Voss.  We need our Boston listeners right now to give us a call.  Tune in that station.  And we want to listen to Rich Voss on an interview.  Why is it a bad show?  I don't know.  No, we just, you know this, Jimmy.  When he goes around America, we like to just... 
[00:12:30]  We follow Rich and we call him.  Fuck up his interviews and stuff.  The best is calling him and hearing his phone ring while he's on the interview.  And he goes, all right.  And then he gets all nervous because he knows who it is, but he can't, like...  He doesn't want to mention it because he doesn't want to blow up his spot.  Yeah, it's great.  And we just get him...  We put him in a horrendous situation.  Are you afraid if he doesn't pick up the phone that you guys will be mad at him?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  He really is a fucking coward.  Um, uh, uh, it's another radio show, um...  And then he calls all of us and leaves messages after the show.  Yeah. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah, on the way out.  Like, I wish I would have known it was you.  I would have picked up.  It would have laughed.  Yeah, exactly.  I always support you guys.  I got my parents coming out today and my sister.  What, to see a taping?  Yeah, I forgot to give them Christmas gifts.  Like a fucking idiot.  I'm like, ah, fuck, bring you out to L.A.  Like, that was what I meant to do.  Right.  So I just forgot to shop for anybody.  So I didn't save myself three days before I got gifts.  So you got to put them up in a hotel and all that?  Yeah, yeah.  I just, I have nothing to do with them.  I mean, I don't know what, what do you do with your family?  I mean, they'll go to Universal one day and I'm fucking doomed. 
[00:13:30]  I have no idea where to take my parents.  How long are they going to be out there for?  For Sunday morning.  Holy crap.  Three nights.  Send them to all the little attractions.  What?  Hey, Dad, you want to get blown on Santa Monica Boulevard?  What are we supposed to do?  And your dad would say yes?  Hopefully, yeah.  You go to Universal?  A little Father Sunday?  Yeah.  And you go to Disneyland?  Then he'd point at me and go, get started.  Hey, Jimmy, we talked about the Ellen DeGeneres thing.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:14:00]  How she said no?  Yeah, it was pretty funny, actually.  Yeah, and how much of a pussy you are now that you've gone Hollywood.  No, no, no.  Why?  I was good.  No, we were just talking, and not so much about that instance, but just because we've  done a couple of things on the air here this week that have made some people that have  sat in a little uncomfortable talking about certain radio personalities and other people  that didn't want to get involved in the bashing, things like that.  And then we were kind of just going around on how some people don't want to burn bridges 
[00:14:30]  and other people just, you know, go over bridges with gasoline cans and matches.  Right.  And you are one of those guys that will not burn a bridge.  What?  I mean, when you compare me to fucking Wrecking Ball O'Neal that you have in the studio today.  He's told us a few of his stories.  They're great.  The funniest thing I think I just thought Patrice do, it was to a William Morris agent.  Did you tell him that?  No.  This is the original Colin Quinn show on NBC. 
[00:15:00]  It was always like 15 of us in the lobby waiting for the show to start, and this big agent,  William Morris, comes in, and he's really nervous, and he goes to Patrice, hey, man,  are you on the show tonight?  And Patrice just humiliates him, and he goes, no, I'm just out here in the lobby watching  the show, you jackass.  William Morris agency.  Really, really embarrassing.  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, that isn't somebody that might have been able to help you out.  You know who's safe I wanted to spin in last night?  Fucking David Spade.  I was in, I had a spot at the improv, and the last three acts were supposed to be me, 
[00:15:30]  and then him, and then Drew Carey at his all-star improv show.  So fucking Spade comes in, and he knows I'm doing a 10-minute spot, and he still bumps me  and goes ahead of me like a fucking douche.  I was so fucking angry, I wish I would have the courage to say it to him.  So angry, man.  I just pulled Todd Barry out of my fucking hallway.  One of these days, Jimmy.  I mean, that's one of these days.  It all comes around.  Yeah, I know, but that was really annoying, and I was really glad I just didn't open my 
[00:16:00]  mouth, and if I would have said something really vicious to Ellen, I mean, you know,  I'm quite sure that, you know, XM would have been kind of pissed at me.  Yeah.  Hold on one second.  We might have Voss on the air.  Ooh.  Jay?  Yep.  They're in commercials?  Yeah, still in commercials.  Of course they are.  Have we ever gone to a phone requesting another radio show on free radio, and them not been  in commercials, where the guy goes, yeah, I'm on, and here they are.  Right.  It's always, no, they're in commercials.  Yeah, we give commercial radio a chance all the time, and every time we plunk down their 
[00:16:30]  little station, they're in commercials.  In commercials.  Hey, Jay.  I heard the guy was giving you a bad mouthing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Jay, as soon as Rich Voss is on, just get it on, you know, turn up the radio and  throw your phone next to him.  We're going to just keep you in the background, so stay quiet, all right?  All right, yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy, well, some guy was doing, trying to be cute in FMQB, they were doing slogans  for commercial radio.  All of them hysterically funny.  Absolutely awful.  And this guy Dave Rossi from WAVF, he wrote this slogan, this is what his slogan would 
[00:17:00]  be for commercial radio, to get you to listen to commercial radio over satellite.  Hey, did you hear what Opie and Anthony did on the radio today?  Nobody did.  Satellite radio.  It's awesome.  That's great.  See, get it?  Because we're here on satellite, and apparently we have no listeners.  Well, you know, that's the type of guy he is, and he makes fun of somebody else to bring  himself up.  I mean, that's up to him.  I don't think we need to do that kind of humor. 
[00:17:30]  No.  Mean-spirited.  So yesterday we did a little...  Guys, the show's on, but our boss isn't on right now.  All right, just keep it in the background, and do what I told you to do, and everyone  would be very happy.  Ooh, you just got a talking down, too.  So we did some research on Dave Rossi yesterday, Jimmy, and we found out he's like just a mid-day  jock that just plays a lot of music and pretty much does nothing on his own show.  And he's only heard in, what, Charleston, South Carolina.  We wanted to listen to a little bit of him yesterday, and the mid-day shift starts at 
[00:18:00]  10 a.m.  So we had it up in the background at 10 a.m.  He didn't come on until, I guess, I think 10.40?  10.45.  10.45.  45 minutes of his boss telling him, for the first 45 minutes, don't utter a word.  Just play music and shut your face.  Yeah, you're so good and so talented that I don't want you to even breathe on Mike for  45 minutes.  And we trashed him pretty good, and you know our past.  I'm sure they got a hold of everyone that works at the damn station down there. 
[00:18:30]  And he finally got on the air, and I'm convinced that we got to him because you can hear the  nervousness in his voice.  Yeah, on his first break, he knew we were listening in.  We didn't play this yesterday because we ran out of show, but we recorded it.  So listen to this real fast.  It's only like 40 seconds.  This is Dave Rossi being real brave.  96th wave, Billy Pilgrim with Insomniac.  That's a wave classic of your self-titled CD from back in 1994. 
[00:19:00]  Let's see.  I got some tickets to give away.  Now, a couple things happening at the Windjammer this weekend.  It is, we're going to the beach.  We're going to be hanging out at the beach right there on the front beach on the autopoems  on Friday and Saturday night.  Now, Saturday night, we're doing the, what is it, your mama's big fat booty band is playing.  Critically on the Broadcasting Live.  Friday night as well, the occasional milkshake, that's Mark Bryan's band from Hooting the  Blowfishes side project with Hank and the Blue Dogs.  Good band.  And we've got tickets to give away for both of those events.  So if you want to let him hang out, I'm going to give him one here in just a few moments. 
[00:19:30]  Also, another big set of 96 Wave.  There it is.  That was his break yesterday.  He's at the back of a show.  We don't have to go to war with him.  96 Wave.  Yeah, he, I think, I guess, I think people called him up and told him we were, like,  had him on the air and we were listening.  And he definitely was a little flustered.  There are so many guys in America that sound exactly like that when they do their show.  I resent the fact that you think that I don't burn bridges. 
[00:20:00]  I mean, that's not true.  I'll say anything.  Oh, yeah.  You'll burn the Pauly Shore Bridge.  No, I never burn the bridge of Pauly if you're listening.  I like him.  Faggot.  So what happened with Ellen?  First of all, she looked a lot older in person.  I was really happy.  She's 55 in person.  Wow.  And I went to get a shot with her because she walked by with a big camera crew and she  stopped.  There was a big crowd around her and I shook her hand and I knew she didn't know who I 
[00:20:30]  was.  So I said, hey, you know, I'm a comic and you might as well get a quick shot with you.  And she goes, no, no, I can't.  And she's walked away.  That's, that's, that's a rough one.  And to Jimmy, that is a slap in the face like no other.  From another comic, I've never said no.  But then again, she did have a big crew with her, but I was fucking, I would, I, if I could  have bit her and got away with it legally, I would have just, I would have bit her face.  I was that angry.  Now, Jimmy, was she taping something at that moment or was a crew following her to tape 
[00:21:00]  something somewhere else at the CES?  Like, because that might have been a little weird if she was taping a segment for something  and you come in and ask for an autograph.  Oh, no, no, no, she's talking to Gary Hahnemann before, like, you know what I mean, just chatting.  Okay, so a little XM business was going on.  So there's your tie-in right there also.  Well, yeah, exactly.  Well, he didn't know.  I mean, it wasn't like he could have introduced me.  He just kind of stopped talking to her and I stuck my stupid hand out.  I think you should have gone with the I'm on channel 202 here at XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:21:30]  Could I get a picture?  Instead of I'm a comic.  Well, you know why?  It was so hectic and I didn't even know she would know what that was.  She was so like...  She wouldn't know what that was.  She's there.  She's on and she draws a paycheck from this company.  You could have used...  You should have wielded your XM power and not your comic powers.  Either way, she should have taken the picture and she didn't because she had a bunch of  fat house frows following her.  She was afraid that probably if she took one, she'd have to take more.  Well, at least, at least you handled it like an adult. 
[00:22:00]  Didn't yell, scream, and throw a temper tantrum akin to a five-year-old that we all heard about.  Yeah, no, I was fine.  I mean, I handled it with dignity, you know.  Dignity.  I'm surprised you can say that word.  You know I was three seconds away from just crying on the floor at CES.  I saw it in your face.  I saw it in your face.  You were ready to cry.  Norton really thinks he's a list celebrity, like a list.  He's not even in the alphabet listed.  Like, he's a D or E list celebrity. 
[00:22:30]  And he has this attitude like, how dare you?  Norton's like, how dare she walk by?  Well, I never.  You fucking idiot.  No one should take a picture with you.  That's not true.  She should have.  I know I'm a nobody because I had to say I'm a comic.  I didn't shake her hand and go, Ellen.  And then, you know, expect her to go, Jimbo.  I mean, I know.  I know.  It's a tough crowd a couple times.  She has no idea who I am.  But as a comedian, she should have taken the photo.  Yeah.  She just didn't.  Jimmy sees the pictures of his celebrity friends, all of them that he has, and he's got a shitload. 
[00:23:00]  And he sees that as him having had some type of relationship with that person.  Yeah.  More of a personal, hey, how you doing?  Like, now we know each other than just take a picture with a celebrity.  I told him to stop.  Well, I mean, you know, sometimes I look at that.  I go to Jim's house from time.  I went back when he used to live the other place.  Yeah.  And I look at the pictures and I go, wow, I should have like a chronicle of my career.  But I'm like, eh.  Because Jim never looks like more famous than anybody in the pictures he took. 
[00:23:30]  Like, if you don't know Jim, you look at the pictures and he always looks like the motherfucker that took the picture with him.  No one ever looks like they took a picture with Jim.  I'm going to break in really fast here because we're going to miss Voss.  Kim in Boston, what's up?  Voss is on and he's talking about beating one of the radio DJs.  Let's hear it.  All right, let's put it.  Just put your phone near the radio.  Yeah, please, Kim.  Help us out.  Are you still dating the hot girlfriend or no?  We got married.  You got married?  Congratulations.  She's a great lady.  She took her.  Me and her. 
[00:24:00]  Not her.  Yeah, we got married in September.  Okay.  Are you still calling me?  They're calling him.  Yeah, just this week she's not working with me.  We were at last week.  We were working at Poughkeepsie, matter of fact.  And we're leaving and we stopped to go to get coffee.  And she walked in to get the coffee and I walked in to pay for gas.  She thought I was standing next to her.  And she closes her eyes and leans her head on this guy and starts singing on top of the world. 
[00:24:30]  With her eyes closed on this complete stranger's shoulder.  If it goes to voicemail, call him again and again and again.  I think we heard where it started ringing and he kind of paused.  He picked on top of the world and he looked at it, you know.  I told him, I said, you got to take care of him now.  I mean, you don't just lay your head on some stranger's shoulder without, you know, full release.  You know what I'm saying?  I'll get the coffee and take care of the stranger.  That's how I roll. 
[00:25:00]  She was 22.  She was 22.  I still use her line, by the way.  When we went to your show, she has a line where she walks into a room and someone asks,  why, what's that smell?  Oh.  Yeah.  Now they make me do that wherever we are and I have to scream at you.  Those are my private.  She did that line probably a hundred times.  That's the week after we went to her.  We can't wait to take her to Vegas.  Do they have a hole on this show?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You did this as funny, man.  We appreciate you coming on the show.  Oh, I love it. 
[00:25:30]  I'm glad you had me.  This is great.  I already told this story, but I'll tell her again.  How she almost killed me on the honeymoon.  Okay.  It's been told, but.  Oh, gosh.  She had a period and then went short for her.  Of course it's been told.  Let's go upstairs and, you know, fool around.  She had a period.  It was my time of the month.  So I swam away from her because I'm thinking, hey, if she wants to attract you.  You want to buy a tampon?  I'm walking around Hawaii with one arm like a surfer.  You know what I'm saying?  I can't even surf. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah, she has an HBO special out now.  That's nice.  Yeah, she's doing good.  And we had a pilot last year.  Did you get an HBO?  It's not even rich anymore.  No.  Please.  It's got every time, every time.  It's deflating.  It's deflating.  It's just rich and boning.  It's deflating, man.  Like Stiller and Mira.  I still love Wasp, but almost just like when I tap him on the top of the head kind of way.  You're like, you always have a place in my heart. 
[00:26:30]  Fucking loser.  I've been on more vacations from that gift desk.  It's unbelievable the stuff they give.  And you know these celebrities aren't used in half of them.  You know, just just...  Yeah, everyone's trying to call.  We've used...  I think he turned his phone off.  Every skin cream from around the world.  I think every...  You go to these resorts, you know, you feel like...  When we went to Hawaii for our honeymoon...  Oh, we...  The honey...  He can't just talk about himself or just...  I wouldn't pay $1,800 for...  He's the guy now that has to talk about his wife. 
[00:27:00]  Everywhere he goes.  I don't know about it.  Often to get that shit.  The tips are outrageous.  I mean, you just got to...  You know, just...  We were at one place.  Do you think Bonnie goes out and just...  Every word out of her mouth is about Rich?  He turned his phone off.  He turned his phone off.  Yeah, his phone off.  He's on to us, finally.  Yeah.  I tipped him.  Another guy comes along the...  Bastard ruined our bit.  I tipped him.  I tipped my wife.  I tipped the gas station.  I tipped everybody.  So I...  So then when you take a cruise, you take a cruise, you pull up. 
[00:27:30]  They want a tip for taking the luggage out of your car.  And then the luggage to load it.  And then the tip to load it out.  It really is ridiculous.  You better tip those fucking cruise guys when they take your bags.  You want your bags in your fucking room?  You tip those guys.  I've never been on a cruise.  When you're cruising, it's not reasonable.  Oh, it's in more cruise and the cruise.  Me and Bonnie.  We had this wonderful stateroom and I said Bonnie.  He's so defanged.  Oh, isn't he? 
[00:28:00]  He's just so...  He's PG-13 now.  You introduced that remote from the movie theater.  He said, did you see this?  I gotta go, guys.  All right, Kim.  This is my commercial.  Thank you so much.  Yep.  Bye.  All right, there's a little taste of Voss doing some radio in Boston today.  Hey.  I looked into a fucking Newhart album.  Here are my wife.  Norton, what the fuck?  You talk to Voss more than any of us.  What the fuck is happening?  Is it like...  Why does he think love has to do this to a person? 
[00:28:30]  I don't know.  He's just a fucking frightened man.  I think one day he's gonna wake up and realize that she's married and nothing.  He just has to fucking keep talking about her.  So he has to just keep talking about her to remind her that they're married, lest she  forget and just leave one day or not come home?  Yeah, I think that's what it is.  I mean, Voss has never had any kind of self-esteem or he's never got...  He probably shouldn't.  He is gonna fall into a chasm when she leaves him.  She's gone.  He is going to. 
[00:29:00]  What is gonna happen, man?  Crack, gambling, drinking.  It's all gonna come back.  It's all gotta come back.  I gotta fill this void in my soul.  I gotta.  Porcelain teeth falling out.  He'll be back.  Those teeth will be smacked out of his head by some black crack dealer one day as they  just take his money and give him a piece of soap.  I'll be at a rest stop.  Voss?  It's cold out here.  It's cold out here.  Jimmy, did you hear that story? 
[00:29:30]  For Patrice?  For what?  Give Jimmy the story really fast.  I did.  I was driving.  I was tired.  I had to stop at a rest stop and I went to sleep and this fucking white guy knocked him  on, you know, comes up to my window and I'm like, what's up?  He goes, it's cold out here.  I go, what?  Look at Norm.  He's like, ah, memories.  He's like, it's cold out here.  And then he pulls my door handle and I go, well, go inside.  Clueless. 
[00:30:00]  Clueless that he's a sissy.  I didn't give you advice while he was trying to suck you.  I'm going to put on some mittens.  You know, a hat.  Most heat is lost through the top of the head, sir.  A hat would help you.  I didn't realize it was a pick-up line.  I really did.  I'm such an idiot.  It's cold out here.  He's just trying to tell him to go into McDonald's.  Oh, go in.  Go inside, dude.  He's joking outside his window.  He's trying to have like a barometric pressure discussion.  If you don't buckle up, you're going to get sick. 
[00:30:30]  This is the flu season.  And then the guy drove away with a Christmas tree on top of his car.  Subaru Outback with a Christmas tree on top.  Oh, I hope it was that fucking disease-ridden intern, that cock-sucker.  You've got everybody sick.  Who knows?  Damn.  Jimmy, the HBO thing's going well, huh?  Yeah, man.  I got to go to bed.  I kind of took a nap and then woke up.  I got to go back to bed.  But it's going great, man.  We got one more to do after.  We have two more.  One more we taped tomorrow, and then I'm back. 
[00:31:00]  That is unbelievable.  How many episodes did you tape already?  This will be number 12.  12 episodes.  Yeah.  And they picked it up for like more, right?  Well, they want to do 21 total, but we have to wait to see if it's popular or not before  they pay for eight more.  When's it coming?  June, it looks like.  Oh, shit.  Jimmy's about to be a fucking celebrity celebrity.  Yeah, Jimmy's about to blow up.  Hobnobber.  I just saw the Louis C.K. HBO special, too, last night.  Very funny. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, he's really good.  Yeah.  He's really funny.  He hitched himself to a winner, I think.  Yeah.  Mr. fucking coattail rider.  I know.  I always kind of know who's fucking ready to take off.  I just kind of jump on it.  Right on there.  Ride him, cowboy.  Yeah!  Yeah!  He rode that O&A train until it fucking went off the track.  The second that derailed, he jumped off on the Colin Quinn Express.  It was like, what was the movie about that demon that would just touch you and all of  a sudden he's inside of you?  Oh, Fallen.  Yeah.  That's exactly what it was.  That's Jimmy. 
[00:32:00]  Jimmy's Fallen.  Whoosh.  Whoosh.  And it was easy for him to dump you for Colin because he was off the air at the time, but  now it's like, oh, shit, he wants to really dump you for HBO?  Yeah.  He's not sure.  As soon as they get the ratings, the fall quarterly.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Louis C.K.  Yeah!  And, Jimmy, you're getting more dialogue as you go along here, too, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got a few scenes this week.  I mean, I got actually three this week, and we're shooting some really weird cold open. 
[00:32:30]  It's going good to the farm.  I'm very happy.  Well, the crowd reaction has been great, huh?  Yeah, I mean, you know, people seem to like it.  Although, we get a lot of fucking weird, like, rehab people that come because it's the first  season, so people have no idea what the show is, so there's no fans of the show.  So it's all like, you know, just like people that they take from rehab.  That's how they get audiences into these shows.  They'll get these, like, fucking guys from, like, Halfway Houses and shit, and they'll bring  them out.  It really is funny.  Yeah, fill up the audience.  We have so much low self-esteem comedians, man. 
[00:33:00]  I just don't know if you know this.  It's like Jimmy did something that we all do.  Like, Opie says, hey, Patrice, man, I think you got a hit.  And I just deflected with some...  And you go, man, I hear Opie goes, yeah, no, I hear it's crazy.  And he's like, you know, people reacting.  He's trying not to, like, jinx it and shit.  You don't want to jinx it all the time.  It's just like, I wish I believed in God, like, heavier so I didn't have to go, oh, maybe.  I wish I could just go, yes, it's going to be a hit.  And I'm really fucking sure.  All the time.  No.  Anytime something comes across that it looks like it might work out or be good, I'm like, 
[00:33:30]  well, we'll see.  We're looking into it.  We'll see how it plays out.  You know, we got people working on that, and hopefully don't fucking jinx it.  It's going to be big.  All of the year of jinxing it, it's not even the self-esteem, because, like, I fell in  love with, you know, again, O&A and then Tough Crowd, and they both got removed.  So every time I love something, it goes.  But I look forward to it.  I can walk in with, like, fucking sunglasses and a scarf and spit on everybody in my studio.  And it'd be like Jack Black can't get Norton back in. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, yeah.  And he doesn't go, blah, blah, blah, no more, no more scallop talk.  Norton got a tan and a new rock hussing chin.  His people are going to get to him eventually.  There's a town I know where the hipsters go.  We're going to have to take a little edge out of here, Jim.  Cool and smooth and shit.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Greg, Tone, how are you?  Yeah, great.  Tone.  Wonderful.  Don't tell me.  Well, Jimmy, your people are telling me that you've got to go, so.  Yeah, you've got to get me out of here. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  But listen, man, I'll see you guys.  That never gets old.  I'm actually standing looking at the clock going, I've got to go to bed, but I realize  I have to wrap it up here.  All right.  I'll see you guys.  Patrice will see you, man.  All right.  Take care, Jimmy.  All right, Jimmy.  We'll see you in about a week, all right?  Jim.  Bye, sweeties.  Cool.  Jim Norton, everyone.  Live from Hollywood.  Very early for Jimmy, but he's probably still up from last night.  Yeah, he said he took a nap.  I think he still does that.  He's going to nap.  He doesn't sleep eight straight hours ever. 
[00:35:00]  No, we've seen him online.  A couple hours here, four hours here.  I don't know how he does it.  We'll take a break.  On the way, we've got to talk about this crazy birth that happened overnight.  Lady didn't even know she was pregnant.  I don't know how that happened.  We got the 911 call from the Hawaiian incident with the girl.  Unbelievable.  She was in a car submerged in the water calling 911 from a cell phone, and she survived.  Also, we've got to talk about the finger in the chili at Wendy's.  That's still a story?  This is great, what happened to the couple that tried to scam Wendy's. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  They got an ugly sentence for that.  And then, of course, American Idol, and then other Opie and Anthony bullshit on the way.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  80s rock theme song.  This is the Opie and Anthony program.  Patrice O'Neill in studio. 
[00:36:00]  What are we promoting today?  Helium?  Philly?  Yeah, Helium.  I'm in Chicago at some point.  Chicago?  I'm in fucking something or another at some point.  I thought you retired from the road.  One show a month.  Oh, okay.  I go out there and see who hates me.  Not a bad idea.  Came out of retirement at the fucking comic strip.  People walking out.  He sucks.  He's booing.  Oh, shit.  I always try to be the first one to make fun of something fucked up, so I do the minor  tragedy.  Oh, you didn't.  You have minor jokes already? 
[00:36:30]  I'd have everything.  I'm a fucking, I'm a pioneer in this fucking town, man.  I'd take the bullet so these pussy-ass niggas can go up there, see what Patrice said about  the minors, then go, okay, I know not what to say, I know what not to say, I know what  to say.  I know where the safe road is.  I know what to say.  I just said, look, man, you know, what the fuck?  I said, hey, look, first of all, I'm not going to get upset about what the news tell me to  get upset about.  Second of all, when I heard the accident happen, the first thing I thought was, are  there still minors?  Who the fuck is mining? 
[00:37:00]  That's like a nigga going, yo, I'm in jail for robbing a stagecoach, motherfucker.  What are we mining for?  Fucking coal?  Are you telling me that you died so I could cook a hot dog this July 4th, nigga?  And I was so rusty.  This girl goes, one of my uncles was a miner, and it was like a black girl.  And my brain was so fried and so not in the moment that I didn't go, bitch, what nigga  has a mining uncle?  What black person has an uncle who mined on niggas mining? 
[00:37:30]  And so she just gives up due to march out, and I said, all right, fuck you and leave.  Yeah.  And I just cursed everybody out and shit.  Just got ugly from there.  Yeah, but see, I stopped that shit.  I don't want to be a modder.  Right.  With all the comics watch me have nervous breakdowns on stage in front of people and  shit like that.  Too soon.  Too soon.  You're doing the mining stuff.  Yeah, but you fucking talk about it.  When it happens, immediately, see what happens.  Everything is funny.  Nix Marie's friggin' funeral. 
[00:38:00]  That one is...  Got any jokes about child in a casket there?  No, that one's career ending.  Yeah, that's a bad one.  You can't fucking joke.  There's nothing funny about this.  It is something funny about it.  You could try to go there, but that one's career ending.  People just want to know that.  Well, do we have the audio from yesterday?  The news had to interview this little girl that went to the funeral.  Do we have that again to play for Patrice because he wasn't here yesterday?  Awful.  A mom decided that it was important enough to go to this little girl's funeral, okay?  Mom should have been smacked. 
[00:38:30]  There's no connection whatsoever except she read the story in the news.  I heard about this shit, yeah.  And she brought her little kid down there.  She just went.  To look at a dead girl.  She just went because I have a little girl.  Let me look, you know.  She takes a little kid to the funeral and goes, let me have my little girl look at a little  dead girl.  Right.  And then the news had interviewed the little girl that went to the funeral for this other  little girl and there's no connection whatsoever.  Listen, listen to this little girl.  The waits for little Nix Marie are any indication of how her funeral will be. 
[00:39:00]  Hundreds of people are expected here at St. Mary's Church for the services at 9 a.m.  While the child's mother and stepfather sit in jail indicted by a grand jury, people old  and young are mourning the death of the child.  I wanted to come see her because her story touched me and I felt so bad.  That wasn't right for my father's day.  What is wrong with that little girl's parents? 
[00:39:30]  Why would you put your little girl through that?  And the sad thing is just like, you know, we're so brainwashed, like the way we think as people  that anybody listening to that in the comfort of their own fucking face without anybody else  around, you just go, you.  Ugh.  Yeah.  That fucking who is this fucking kid?  You just think Dakota Fanning immediately and that she was prepped to do that.  No Puerto Rican should ever be allowed, I'm going to tell you this right now, no Puerto 
[00:40:00]  Rican should be allowed to tell touching stories.  Now, this kid wasn't Puerto Rican, but when they start doing the, and then I had six kids  myself, I think that it is, no, and it's no, that was so, no, it just was, no, it's just,  it takes away from my ability to go, oh man, you're fucked up, man, and we interviewed Valencia 
[00:40:30]  Velasco, and she, and then I, I would never hit my kids and die, and you just go, what  the fuck, only interview American citizens when it comes to being sad, it was a terrible  thing, man, I just, it's, it's hard for me to speak, and you can relate to that, it's  just some terrible shit, and you know, it's just wrong.  I don't know why they hurt her like that, that's not right, she just a baby, yeah, we 
[00:41:00]  got it, we understand, but the Daily News is in a bit of trouble today, because they  had a nice picture of the dead girl on the front page yesterday, yesterday, a picture  of the coffin, open, oh no, it was the day before, I was here, when they had the little  girl, it was the day before, yeah, it was the day before, because, well, they got all sorts  of letters, man, they got letters, letters, let's see, I went to, brown's wake, and I  can't get the little girl's bruised face off my mind, the Daily News front page photo didn't 
[00:41:30]  do justice to what really showed, oh, this guy kind of wanted a close-up, yeah, this  guy wanted more, full color, sick fuck, she was battered so viciously, the funeral parlor's  makeup couldn't cover up the bruises, my heart bled when I saw this precious little  angel in that coffin, placing the poor little girl's picture as she lay in her coffin on  the cover was very disturbing and sleazy, you have crossed the line, it's Alan from Rego 
[00:42:00]  Park, I'd agree with Alan, let's see what Alan from Walden has to say, I was dumbfounded  that the news put a picture of a seven-year-old girl in a coffin on the front page, I hope,  Nick's Marie's coffin sold a lot of papers for you today, that was the goal, wasn't  it, oh, corpse, yeah, oh, yeah, sold a lot of papers for you today, that was the goal,  wasn't it, oh, of course it is, yes, but look, they got the picture of her, the paper will 
[00:42:30]  never admit it, but of course that's the reason they do stuff like that, look at the post today,  it's like, what, what pitch is this, like, it's like, it's, it's like, it's, yeah, that's  a school photo, enough of that, man, yeah, they, they're not going to let this story  go for a while, it's selling too many papers, they love it, let's say hi to Duke in Nevada,  he is a miner, Duke, holy shit, hey, what's up, where's Claude at, what's up, Trees, hey,  man, what's going on, you cattle rustling or fucking having a shootout at noon, motherfuckers, 
[00:43:00]  we got, uh, we got gold mines out here, gold, there's gold in them nine hills, there you  go, we, you're speaking my language, nigga, I'm sorry about that, Duke, have you found  any gold, you got pans and shit, you shit, you fucking asshole, are you in some old river  somewhere, he's got a mule and a pick, and he hits a rock and licks it, Tarnation, one  my tear, dad, blammy, someone jump my claim, I think a thousand gold dust, a fucking miner, 
[00:43:30]  Jesus, now you move on, this here's my claim, Jesus, don't they have, like, the cotton gin  yet for mines, like, the fucking thing, can't they, from a satellite, see where the gold is  and send a robot down to get it, why are they doing this to you, man, 2006, there shouldn't  be a guy with a pickaxe, you got a pet parakeet you take down there, if it dies, get out of here,  the boys, dynamite, with a long fuse, dynamite, fire in a hole, they're still doing that shit, 
[00:44:00]  what the fuck are you doing, dude, alright, Duke, let us know what's going on with the  mining, I want to know how you mined for gold in 2006, how is that done, well, we use these  massive trucks that are bigger than most people's houses, and these huge shovels that do the  same thing, and we pull it all out of a huge hole in the ground, and dude, there's a whole  bunch of shit that goes into it, but it's a fucking, it's a great job, it's a great way 
[00:44:30]  life, but do you have a helmet with a light on it, answer me that, but wait, there are  underground guys, and they have helmets with lights on them, is it like a fat lamp, like  they light it like a candle, no, no, it's all electric, I don't know, dude, I don't work  underground, he's in the hole, no, hey, wait a minute, he doesn't work underground, he's 
[00:45:00]  no miner, you're no miner then, my friend, you're no miner, we want to hear from a real  miner, and let me ask you, do you get to, like, are they, like, okay, for the gold scissors  goal, do they fucking make you strip butt ass naked like they do in Africa, and check  you, make sure you ain't stealing no fucking gold, put diamonds up your ass, yeah, they  check them Africans, they fucking check them dudes, man, so, and God help them if they find  any diamonds on those lights, oh, they hobble them, so can you, if you wanted to, could you  get away with a couple ounces, no, this is all microscopic gold, we don't see it, we 
[00:45:30]  don't ever get to see it, yeah, they pull tons of dirt out of the ground, and, like, for  every ton of dirt they pull out, how much gold do you get, depending on the grade of  the ore, sometimes there'll be, like, a quarter ounce to the ton, quarter ounce per ton of  dirt, yeah, but each truck, each truck hauls about 400 tons, a huge, massive truck, that's  like a pretty wide scale version of mining, you know, they, yeah, there it is, and Patrice 
[00:46:00]  has it around his neck, I have your, that's eight billion tons worth of dirt on Patrice's  neck, yeah, this dirt had to be, it was a lot of dirt, a lot of dirt, oh, man, what do you  do with the dirt, yeah, it's, uh, but it's a good job, hey, we love, we fucking love you  guys, we all got XM radios in our big trucks and our equipment, I gotta know what he does  with the dirt, because they can't put it back in the hole, because they're mining, we got  dumps out on the side, where we dump the waste ore, and then we take the regular ore 
[00:46:30]  either to a lease pad, where they leach the gold out, or we take it to a mill, where they  mill the gold out, yeah, all right, well, say hi to the boys, but it's great, hey, we fucking  love you guys, we listen to you every day, well, give a shout out, we're, you know, what's  the company, whatever, uh, it's Elko, Nevada, we just got, our fucking company just got  bought by Barrett Goldstrike, but it's one of the biggest gold companies in the world,  we fucking love you guys, we'll talk to you later, I bought some stock in a gold, uh, outfit  once, they're pretty good on it, yeah, yeah, they're like, it's a good stock to buy, yeah, 
[00:47:00]  all right, let's go to Carlos from O-Town, bring it on, brother, hey, what's going on,  guys, good morning, good morning, love your show, hey, listen, I wanted to, uh, I wanted  to call Patrice out on, uh, something you said earlier, you know, and this is, this is  why the educational system in this country is the way it is, all right, I'm going to tell  you right off the bat, Puerto Ricans, Patrice, are American citizens for the last, I, look  it, man, he's going to educate you, let him educate you, I fucking know, all right, go  ahead, man, he's going to educate you, I just, it just gets so tiring to hear these 
[00:47:30]  videos on, you know, oh, yeah, get a, you know, get a green card, blah, blah, blah,  you know, moron.  Now, let me, I'm going to, I'm going to, I definitely understand what he's saying, but  let me explain something to you, and this is why every other race, ethnic group in this  country is losing.  You got to understand that when I say Puerto Rican, and anybody says Puerto Rican, we mean  all of you.  You are the banner for all of you.  Puerto Rican is the easiest thing to say, has a good ring to it, but we don't have the time 
[00:48:00]  that all the Puerto Ricans do to separate yourselves, Mexicans, Cubans, oh, I'm Guatemalan, we don't  give a shit, so this is why I'm letting you people know to get into, all of you, Asians,  fucking Puerto Ricans, Hindus and Arabs, pick a fucking color, pick a color so that we can  care.  I know that you're fucking U.S. citizens.  No, you don't.  No, you do, and here's the thing, they, they're U.S., they're not U.S. citizens, 
[00:48:30]  you have, you're a U.S., uh, uh, uh, you're a, uh, uh, what, a territory, and you're not  a fucking state, you don't pay taxes, and your goddamn Puerto Ricans won't join us, you're  really not with us, and here's the thing, you know who's gonna be the downfall of you  people?  The other Puerto Ricans that don't like you, because people don't know this, Cubans and  all other Puerto Ricans, they don't like these Puerto Ricans, because they don't have to  sneak in the country, and these motherfuckers let everybody know, like he's letting me 
[00:49:00]  know, we're citizens.  Right.  But why do you still talk like these?  I talk like my, my kids.  See, again, see, I was born and raised in Puerto Rico, my English is probably better than  yours.  Yeah, you sound pretty good.  That guy does sound pretty good.  Yeah, he sounds pretty good.  Born and raised in Puerto Rico.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's full of shit.  I ain't believing, I don't believe it.  I've never heard, I've never heard a Puerto Rican sound like this in my life.  There are Puerto Ricans that came here when they were two, they're 38 years old, and they're 
[00:49:30]  still like, hey, what the, he spells kids K-E-E-D-S, my kids.  I know, I know that you're American, you're not American citizens, you're American something,  you're a territory.  Oh, you know, we've been citizens since like 1960 or 61.  You're not citizens, man, because you're not a state.  It's got nothing to do with it, we're a grand citizen.  You can come in the country without problems, but for, but for real, there's going to be 
[00:50:00]  another vote.  If you guys don't vote to be a state and we take taxes, they're going to, they're going  to throw you to the side and you're going to be other Puerto Ricans.  I want Puerto Rican tax money, man.  We want Puerto Rican taxes.  I want Puerto Rican tax money.  We could use some more chickens.  I don't see that, right?  The Puerto Rican, the Puerto Rican tax is a chicken, the 1040 easy chicken form.  He's right, but the context is like when people say Puerto Rican, it's just that they, Mexican 
[00:50:30]  is a Puerto Rican too.  Right.  To the people who aren't Latino.  Up here.  You know something though?  In Southern California, Puerto Ricans are Mexican.  Are Mexican.  Like everyone's Mexican.  Everyone's a Mexican.  Right.  But you're like, look, I'm Puerto Rican.  I know it's ignorant, but it is what it is.  I got no time to figure out if a Chinese person's eyes don't do the same thing as a Korean.  Right.  We've got regular U.S.  Postal Service down there.  All right, Carlos.  This guy is selling Puerto Rico. 
[00:51:00]  He's selling Puerto Rico.  Don't worry.  We're still going there.  We love your beaches.  All right.  There he goes.  Bye, Carlos.  He thought I said beaches.  Beaches.  I meant where you go to swim.  Where you go to swim?  See, his English isn't that good, motherfucker.  I love your beaches.  I love her too.  I love our beaches too.  Let's go to Joe in Massachusetts.  Joe.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I got a really bad joke for you.  Yeah.  What did Jesus say to the Puerto Ricans before he died?  Don't do anything until I get back. 
[00:51:30]  Punching out.  So you get it because they don't work?  So you don't do anything?  I fill in, and he laughs at the joke that he bombed with.  I hated that joke.  That's great.  That was stupid.  All right.  We got some things to go over today.  San Jose, California.  A couple.  Remember this story?  A couple who planted a severed finger in a bowl of Wendy's chili.  Remember that?  It went down about a year ago.  And she bought it from a dude.  She bought the severed finger and decided, all right, I'm going to throw this in some chili. 
[00:52:00]  I'm going to go back up to the counter and go, look what I found in your goddamn chili.  Oh, she was seeing frigging dollar signs.  She was seeing dollar signs.  That's it.  Because we've all heard the story.  Someone burns their stupid penis on a hot cup of coffee.  Next thing you know, we're paying him ten fucking million dollars.  Sips on his testicles on a wobbly toilet seat somewhere.  Right, right.  All that crap.  All those frivolous lawsuits, they call them.  Well, holy crap.  A couple who planted a severed finger in a bowl of Wendy's chili in a scheme to extort money from the fast food chain was sentenced yesterday to lengthy prison terms. 
[00:52:30]  Wow.  Anna Ayala, 40, who said she'd been into the dead.  Did you drink it?  Was sentenced to nine years in state prison.  She got nine years.  Holy shit.  Nine fucking years in state prison.  In the big house?  In the big house.  Her husband, Jane Plasencia, 44, who obtained the finger from a co-worker who lost it in a workplace accident.  They got the finger from a co-worker?  Like, that would be hard to hold it.  That wouldn't be hard to, like, track down. 
[00:53:00]  No, how about you get your finger chopped off at work and you don't go to the hospital with it, packed in ice to try to reattach it?  You just go, oh, well, my finger is gone.  Maybe I can sell it to my cousin.  It's not a friggin' hubcap or something.  He sold his fucking finger.  He sold his finger.  And you know it couldn't have been for more than 50, 60 bucks.  No, you know it was on the cheap.  Well, the husband of this lady who claimed this happened, he got 12 years. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, my God.  She got nine and he got 12.  That's excessive, man.  What do they call the crime?  Frog?  The pair pleaded guilty to conspiracy to file a false insurance claim and attempted grand theft with damages exceeding 2.5 million.  Oh, wow.  See, that was the amount.  Grand fraud?  I got him.  Ayala said she retched March 22nd after biting into the fingertip at a Wendy's in San Jose, California.  How do you get caught, though?  They tracked that finger down.  They didn't know where it came from. 
[00:54:00]  No.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Wendy's had this whole investigation, went through all their processing plant and everything,  and asked if anybody had lost the digits, and no one did.  Yeah, but still, how do you know it's fraud?  So the police start thinking there's something fishy going on.  They start looking at the family that's pulling the shenanigans and start looking if anybody lost a finger at work that they know,  any relatives of theirs, and they come across, you know, Cousin Jose working at the mill, or a miner, whatever he does, 
[00:54:30]  and there he is, nine fingers on his hand, and finger.  And they did a test, and it was his finger.  Yeah, it's probably easy to figure out.  Did he get in trouble for selling his finger?  I don't know.  I don't think that's a crime.  Is it?  Finger selling?  Finger selling.  Well, William Shatner just sold his gallbladder, so if that shows up in somebody's chicken noodle soup.  Damn kidney stone or something.  He sold, yeah, a stone to goldenpalace.com. 
[00:55:00]  Twenty-five large.  We were trying to do that, that bit.  Sell something funky like that?  Yeah, yeah.  What are you going to sell, though?  I'm trying to remember what it was.  Somebody had a body part.  That's something you pee out.  The kidney stone is something you pee out, right?  Well, sometimes you can.  Yeah, it's supposed to be really painful, and it's got to work its way through your kidneys,  which are like just filled with these balls of spaghetti,  and it works its way through these tubes, and it just chews its way through. 
[00:55:30]  Like every little, and it's like a little meteor, so it's a bunch of points on it,  and it just tears shit up the whole way.  How big is that?  And then the final finale is it's got to go through your dick.  Got to go through your little pee hole.  They range in size from a little tiny little thing up to the size of a good-sized pea,  and they're just spiky.  You ever had one?  No, my brother did.  He was laid up like he would – it was years ago when I was living in a house 
[00:56:00]  with like five other people, and we used to call it Pee Wee's Playhouse.  It was just nothing but us goofing off and drinking the whole time,  hiding when the landlord showed up, shit like that.  And my brother was staying over, and he would just –  I feel weak right now.  I know.  I feel just like wobbly.  It became something he did.  As we were just hanging out drinking, he would just lay down on the floor in the fetal position, moaning.  Oh, oh.  As it's working its way through the kidneys. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  And then through the urethra.  The pain.  There's pain in the kidneys too.  Yeah.  But then it's horror when it gets to the dig.  Yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  And it's got to work its way out.  Then you – like you can feel it in your back when you have kidneys.  And then up front in the bladder and the – then through the urethra.  And it's just chewing up everything.  And then when it comes out, it just makes a sound like a dime hitting the bottom of the toilet.  Clunk.  Ding.  Oh, fuck me, man.  You're supposed to piss through a filter.  You're supposed to piss through a filter for a while.  It looks like a big coffee filter to see when it comes out so you can take it to the doctor, I guess, and you can make sure it's all out around. 
[00:57:00]  I'm just feeling nauseous.  That boy of Shatner tried to fucking soul that hunk of –  And there's these little like blood shards that come out with it.  As it's ripping you.  As it's just ripping you out of your tubes.  Fucking your dick tube.  As it turns your penis into a vagina.  Right.  Vagina.  Dana, St. Louis, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I love my radio.  I love your show. 
[00:57:30]  Please.  Were you on American Idol last night?  Dana.  No, sir.  I was not.  Listen, let me tell you.  Why the chick name?  We've got to get to the bottom of this.  Well, I –  I don't know many guys named Dana.  That's all.  Maybe I'm being stupid.  Dana Carvey.  Carvey's a biggie.  You're right.  My parents –  Stupid man.  Way back when, I guess there was a movie star by the name of Dana Andrews.  Yeah, Dana Andrews.  And so that's – I guess that's where it's from. 
[00:58:00]  I don't know.  I'm stuck with it.  I guess I'm kind of like Patrice.  I'm going to have to go through my whole life explaining my first name.  Any nicknames so it's not Dana?  Dane?  No.  D-Funk?  It's Dana.  Thank you.  Let me tell you guys.  Please make Patrice a permanent addition to the show.  His humor is so funny.  Fuck that nigga.  I hope he said fuck that nigga.  I had to pull over because I was laughing so damn hard.  I love your show. 
[00:58:30]  I love it, man.  Keep rocking, guys.  I'm punching out.  All right, D-Bone.  All right.  There you go.  Dana digs you, man.  Dana's in love with you.  The men with the women's names.  Patrice gets good reviews.  Opie's like fuck that nigga.  Fuck that nigga.  You know what happens?  You compliment them too many times.  They get what they call uppity.  Uppity.  Start making demands and shit.  That's right.  We got to keep you down.  I know I asked for cereal this morning.  Usually it's some eggs.  Did this motherfucker just ask for some go-leaf?  We got to keep you down.  Keep the man down. 
[00:59:00]  You stay out the masses' kitchen, boy.  I'll be coming in here all fucking vossed up.  Hey, everybody.  Patrice, you big dummy.  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah.  I'm happy to be here.  Thanks, Gregory.  Just happy to be part of it.  Thanks, AC.  That's what happens.  You take a nice swing at somebody's head.  Yeah.  All right.  We got the next story.  This one's even better.  All right.  Listen to this.  In Hawaii, a dramatic call for help.  Police have released tapes of a desperate 911 call made by a teenage girl in a sinking car. 
[00:59:30]  Her grandfather was backing out of a parking stall at a yacht club when it plunged into the water.  Old people.  I'm in the car, and I can't open the floor, and the water's coming in, and we're sinking.  No, and I'm going to drown.  Waikiki Yacht Club.  Yes.  Okay.  We're sending some trucks.  Please hurry.  Go.  Can you open the window?  Hello?  Hello? 
[01:00:00]  Oh, boy.  Her grandfather did not survive.  A good Samaritan jumped in the water and pulled the girl to safety.  Police are investigating whether he may have been drinking.  Oh, Jesus.  Drinking.  You got a kid in a car.  Your old granddad.  Grandpa trying to drive.  I hate with all my heart the 911 operators on every call.  They're just so smooth.  Please get as scared as I am.  I'm in a car sinking.  Oh, shit.  All right.  Oh, sorry.  All right. 
[01:00:30]  Okay.  What?  You're kidding me.  I don't know what to do.  Oh, shit.  He's like, all right, we'll send some trucks.  You're so right.  I hate that.  I think that would make you feel a little better.  Oh.  If you're here on the other end, the panic.  Like the amazing.  Because then you know they're doing everything they could possibly be doing.  Because that guy's talking so smooth, you don't know that he's actually going through  procedures.  Like he's already called the cops.  You're thinking there's other calls that might be in front of yours.  Right, right.  Like, well, all right, you're in a sinking car, but I got this guy I got to deal with. 
[01:01:00]  I'm in quicksand.  I'm up to my chest.  Holy shit.  Nigga.  Charlie, listen to this.  What you do for quicksand?  Right.  You know the address?  I don't know wherever quicksand is.  Oh, God.  We'll send a helicopter and everything we got.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I think I'd be more freaked out if the 911 operator was just smooth.  You're so right.  This little girl's like, I'm in a car, I'm sinking, I don't want to drown. 
[01:01:30]  Okay.  Like, it's like, I know it's a technique to keep you calm, but it's like, I don't want  calm.  I want you to be horrified like me.  Panic.  Because I'm panicking.  All right, can you open the window?  How's the weather there?  Right, right, right.  Try to spark up some small talk.  How do you do in school?  Good.  Maybe there's a good song on the radio.  Yeah.  Did you go out on a boat today?  I'm sinking.  Oh, I hate that shit, man. 
[01:02:00]  I'm sinking in daddy's Buick, in your grandfather's Buick.  I don't want to die.  I don't want to die.  Well, we all don't want to drown.  That's a pretty horrific way to go.  Now, do you see fish out your windshield right now?  Yeah.  Turn on the wipers.  You ever hear our best 911 call?  You got those, E-Rock?  Oh, we got some 911 calls.  We got to play them the one about the, well, I don't want to give it away.  Yeah, don't reen it.  Let me see.  It's not, I always, it's a smart-ass dispatcher. 
[01:02:30]  Listen to this one, the smart-ass dispatcher.  All right, hit that.  911, what is your emergency?  Yes, I need a police officer over here.  What's going on?  I've got two teenage daughters, and I just got home from work.  They were physically fighting with each other, and one of them kicked a hole in a door.  And they're 12 and almost 14, and the 12-year-old is completely out of control.  And I can't, I physically, if she's as big as I am, I can't control her.  Okay, did you want us to come over to shoot her? 
[01:03:00]  Are you there?  Excuse me?  That's a joke.  Okay.  Who are you?  That's a joke.  Okay, now, I'm going to pull some Jedi mind shit on you, so you forget what I just said.  Because I just saw my job go out the fucking window.  Isn't that great?  The joke failed miserably, and he's like, oh, shit.  I thought I could kid with this one.  But he could have maintained it if he kept his seriousness. 
[01:03:30]  Do you want us to come shoot her, ma'am?  Shoot her?  No, I'm serious.  That is an option.  We leave all options open for your safety, ma'am.  But no, he was like, it was a joke.  Okay, let's move on now.  Forget about the joke.  But she was not ready to move on.  And after listening to this a couple of times, I think he was within his rights to do that.  This is not a fucking 911 call.  Yeah, I can't control my 12-year-old.  There are people sinking in Grandpa's car, and the cars are supposed to go out because she can't handle her kids. 
[01:04:00]  Right.  Well, listen again.  Listen to the joke failed miserably.  I'm almost 14, and the 12-year-old is completely out of control.  And I can't physically, if she's as big as I am, I can't control her.  Okay, did you want us to come over and shoot her?  Are you there?  Excuse me?  That's a joke.  Okay, so...  Who are you?  What is your name?  Mike Forbus.  Okay, that's not funny. 
[01:04:30]  I'm sorry.  Guess what?  I'm going to file a formal complaint.  Mike Forbus.  I don't blame you a bit.  Hey, because you know what?  This is really not very funny.  I know it's not, ma'am.  Well, guess what?  It's not going to be very funny when I go in front of your supervisor and tell him...  I understand.  I guess he can just listen to the tape.  Yeah, he can.  Oh, now she messed with the wrong cunt, boy.  And now she's beating the shit out of him, and you can hear the phone ring in the background,  and you know that's someone else in distress.  Someone else sinking in their car.  That's the little girl.  But he can't...  My grandpa now!  That's right.  But he can't answer that because he's going to listen to this shit. 
[01:05:00]  Because now he's got to deal with this.  Oh, my God.  There's like a real emergency on the other line, but he can't go to that call because  this bitch has to tell him what.  And now every bit of anger she was feeling because she's a bad parent and can't handle  her fucking kids, every bit of that anger is now completely switched like a rail on  a train.  Cheek, cheek, choo, choo, on another track.  Now it is completely focused on this guy.  Yes.  Go back to it.  She doesn't care about her kids now anymore. 
[01:05:30]  That's not a problem.  Yeah.  Listen to the phone just ringing off the hook in the background.  He can't...  And quickly, an emergency situation, if that guy was screwing around, if it was such a  big emergency, she'd have dealt with this guy later and been like, you know, you don't  sit there while someone's bleeding to death and argue with a man about what he said to  you on the 911 line.  You go, all right, whatever.  Send the ambulance.  Here's the address.  Here's this, that.  This shows that this wasn't an emergency because she completely doesn't care about the emergency  anymore, and now she's just after this guy's ass. 
[01:06:00]  Right.  Here we go.  This is really not very funny.  I know it's not, ma'am.  I'm wrong.  Well, guess what?  It's not going to be very funny when I go in front of your supervisor and tell him...  I understand.  I guess he can just listen to the tape.  Yes, he can.  I'm sorry.  The plug is happening.  Well, sorry, doesn't cut it.  I need a police officer.  Hold on.  I'm here at an industrial mill with a guy with no hands, and the phone's ringing.  Ma'am?  Yeah.  Okay.  12 and...  10 and 12 or 12 and 14?  12 and 13 and a half. 
[01:06:30]  Okay.  All right.  I'll get the police officers on the way.  They're on an emergency call right now, but as soon as I can get one free, I'll get them  on the way.  Oh, well, don't rush or anything.  Well, I apologize for my smart remark, and I will get them in as soon as I can.  Okay.  And what is your name again?  Megan for his job.  Mike Forvis, my number 605.  Thank you.  Yes, ma'am.  Oh, Jesus.  And he didn't get fired, though.  I hope not.  No, we actually got the background story on that.  He was reprimanded, but not fired. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, because he's a smart guy.  That's fucking good old Corey.  He always says shit like that.  Yeah.  You know, I'm shot...  He's a fun guy at the...  Oh, I'm shot in my stomach.  I'm like, do you think it's your liver or your fucking kidneys?  Yeah, what do you think, guys?  Did you shit yourself or piss yourself?  I'm just joking.  Just a little joke.  Because he knows what he's doing.  He's just a jokester.  No one else knows what they're doing.  He's really good at his job.  He fucking probably can type with both hands and two different channels.  Yeah, he also knows that it's just a ridiculous call.  Hedda in New York has something for Anthony. 
[01:07:30]  Hedda?  That's Newark.  What's up, guys?  Oh, Newark.  I'm sorry.  Hey, Anthony, man, I noticed that lately you've been very racist.  Lately?  I take offense to that.  No, well, the old show, you weren't that racist.  And it seems like with Patrice there, you're trying to hold it back a little bit.  Patrice, when you're not there, this guy is damn near Hitler.  I mean, he...  Oh, what is it, Hedda?  Hedda, yeah, Hedda.  I'm very happy.  So you're saying, oh, see, I got an XM radio now, motherfucker. 
[01:08:00]  I can hear your radio.  You know what?  Thank you, Hedda.  Sir?  He's up here smiling in the black man's face, but his good old AC, the racist.  Oh, yeah, yeah, Hedda, Hedda, do you have an example or something?  Oh, all that Hitler stuff, when you talk about Hitler, you talk about it with gusto.  Wait, gusto, you bastard.  Do you think that kind of racism is the kind of racism that Patrice even cares about?  Anti-Semitism?  He don't care.  The blacks hate the Jews.  Not only that, like, sometimes when, like, for example, you might do a news story about, 
[01:08:30]  say, a black guy committed a crime.  You say something smart like...  If I could find one in the paper, I'd do a story about it.  Oh, yeah, you'd be like, oh, yeah, well, who else is going to be?  You know, like, the niggers, you know, like that, whatever.  I never, now, now you're lying.  I'm lying.  Sir, now you are lying.  I never, our listeners are great with that.  Have I ever looked and read a news story?  Shut up, let me talk now. 
[01:09:00]  Uh-oh, here we go.  Have I ever read a news story and gone, Opie, the niggers are at it again.  I can't say you.  Have I ever done that?  Not on the air, no.  I can't say you.  Well, look, I'm just talking about what the listeners hear, not my drive home.  I never heard you call anybody a nigger.  There's absolutely two different shows that come on.  I hear his context.  One on air and one off air.  Yeah.  When I get here, you're just a little more liberal.  A little bit.  A little bit.  You know what?  But that's why I'm here from time to time, Hedda, so that I can control his racist rants. 
[01:09:30]  And I imagine if I wasn't here for Martin Luther King's birthday, what these two motherfuckers  would have said about him.  It would have been a mess.  And Hedda, stop blowing up our spot.  Alabama's just about liking us at this point.  One more thing to say.  Anthony, it's funny as hell.  Keep it up, though.  Thank you, Hedda.  And I...  That's for trying to sell me out to my pal.  He's over here.  What the...  Dirty racist!  And I'm...  You shouldn't hear him.  Hopefully it's all in.  And I'm...  Just what I thought. 
[01:10:00]  All right, Hedda.  Thanks.  Thanks for the help.  Thanks for helping out my insecurities today.  What a selling out, blow up my spot, son of a bitch that guy was.  Oh, well, here come the examples.  Opie is as big a racist.  Let me tell you something.  Opie...  Anthony, you're...  You know what you are?  You are a...  You try to reason through the racism.  Thank you.  I'm a diplomat.  Opie is a complete hunk of shit with the racism.  Just an asshole.  He comes up with some shit that only a racist could even... 
[01:10:30]  About the chess and to say there's no king on a black chessboard?  Right.  Can you...  That's just deep down fucking hunk of shit right there.  That's just a hunk of shit move.  Taking a...  That's just a taste of reality.  That's just a taste of the...  Of the...  Don't call me racist.  Of the naked chessboard.  I used to play basketball with the colored...  That...  There it is.  With the colored.  And they wouldn't let him play.  Yep.  They fucking called him up.  He wasn't as good.  Tight ass hunky.  I kept my own with the brothers on the basketball court back in the day. 
[01:11:00]  Listen to me.  We got some examples of Anthony's racism.  Hi.  It's not about me today.  Brian.  Brian.  Yeah, I got to call you out on it a little bit.  I really don't care what you talk about.  I think it's all funny.  But I got two examples.  First being when you're talking about the mayor of New Orleans.  Right.  You talk about it completely different when Patrice is there.  Yesterday when you were talking about it, you were like, Anthony.  He's a child about putting chocolate back in New Orleans. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  And the other example was Black Earl paying for the check.  And when Earl started complaining for it, he said, I don't see some niggerage.  Oh.  And...  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I never said that.  Pum, bitch.  What happened?  I never said that.  What happened a little bit?  I deny that categorically.  I never said that about Earl.  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  I'm marching out.  See, no one has a real example.  No one has a great example. 
[01:12:00]  Everybody's trying to call Anthony Graves.  They will never find...  I tiptoe...  Hey.  You do have footnose, baby.  I got the footnose.  Anthony got footnose.  I got facts and figures to back up my racism.  We're going to back up.  We got the finger in the chili story.  Oh.  To get more of the facts out there.  I don't think we had all of them.  And it was a gruesome and, to many people, a nauseating story that grabbed the country's attention.  A human finger found in a bowl of fast food chili.  Now the couple behind what turned out to be an extortion scam is facing a long stretch in prison. 
[01:12:30]  Here's ABC's Neil Karlinsky.  Ana Ayala says from behind bars, she wasn't surprised to receive such a harsh sentence.  Nine years in prison.  I was expecting it.  Obviously, I committed a crime and I should pay for it.  Earlier in the San Jose courtroom, there were only tears as she accepted responsibility for the strange scheme  in which she claimed to find a finger in a bowl of Wendy's chili.  I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 
[01:13:00]  Wendy's was hit hard by the scandal and some of the worst publicity a restaurant could ask for.  The company estimated losses at $2.5 million and some employees had to be laid off.  The owner of the Wendy's where the scam took place asked the judge for a stiff sentence.  Please, judge, send a clear message.  And the judge agreed.  Her husband, who obtained the finger from someone who lost it in an accident, was given more than 12 years.  Why Wendy's?  It was there. 
[01:13:30]  It was there.  It wasn't planned.  It was just something that happened.  She said the experience has changed her.  And let this be an example.  I mean, everybody out there, all those young people that learn from this.  Her motive, she says, was simple.  Greed.  Enough of trying to help the young people.  All those young people that have fingers and want to put them in chili.  Right.  I know, exactly.  Like she's going to teach them now.  She's going to teach the youth of America. 
[01:14:00]  You got caught.  Shut up.  You lose.  Good day.  See ya.  They pulled some CSI stuff on him.  Hey, Mr. Voss.  What's up?  Rich Voss.  What's going on?  Hey, Rich.  How are you?  First of all, how did she say that wasn't premeditated?  The guy went out and got a finger.  What had just happened that he ended up with a finger that he dropped in chili?  That was premeditated.  I like how these guys were thinking.  Hold on one second.  We're a little distracted.  What's up there, guys?  We're watching something on, what show is this on ABC? 
[01:14:30]  Good Morning America.  Good Morning America about how to get out of a car that's sinking, and they got a guy  sitting there while the car sinks.  This is an old clip.  This guy did this a couple years back.  Did he?  Oh, he cut his hand open.  Basically, what they say is that, was the window down when he went in?  You got to wait for the pressure to equalize.  I hear if you know you're going over, if you can at least get the...  Unbuckle your seatbelt.  It says open window and get out the window if you can.  Right.  You're supposed to open that window before you submerge, if you can. 
[01:15:00]  If you can.  Or you could do the Ted Kennedy thing, just walk away.  Because the key is to equalize.  You think it'd be smart to keep the windows open, but basically, if you're going over a  bridge or something, you want to try to open up the window before it sinks all the way.  Yeah, but if you can't, if you've got power windows and there's a short or something  like that, then you've got to wait until enough water fills up the vehicle that you  can open it.  He opened the door just now.  And that has got to be...  You can open the door if the water equalizes and is in the car. 
[01:15:30]  That's a tough time.  It looks like you have to open it up immediately.  You have to open the door immediately, let the water come in, because once you're under  water, you can't open it under water.  That's right.  That's what I'm saying.  You have to open it on top of the water.  That's right.  Or at least open the window so the water comes rushing in so it equalizes.  Then you can easily open the door and get out the window if you can do that.  It's a nightmare.  Voss, what's up?  What's going on?  Voss.  Thank you for running my interview.  Did you hear the phone ringing?  No, it happened.  I'll tell you the truth. 
[01:16:00]  It was in my coat pocket.  I wasn't wearing my coat.  It was on vibrate.  And then I just get this strange feeling.  I'm going, I'm in Boston.  I know these creeps are listening.  That's why I...  Even before I went in, I go, I told this story before when I did...  You know, the honeymoon bit.  Yeah.  I go, it's not like I haven't done this.  I've done it before.  Oh, that's why you do that?  Because we were reciting the bit as you were doing it.  Okay.  So, but then during break or something, I take my phone out. 
[01:16:30]  I go, ah, seven missed calls.  Seven.  And I go, ah, it's going to be too uncomfortable, but I got some good plugs for you guys, and  I don't know if you heard them.  No.  No, we're hoping that we got a tape of it, because then I heard they started taking phone  calls, and you got a few Ramones that got through.  Yeah, but I mean, I was saying how funny O&A are, and then I go, we're doing a wow  stuff, if you want wow stickers.  Oh, that's fun.  I did, you didn't do the, you didn't hear the whole bit about how I took Patrice as my 
[01:17:00]  opening act on the road.  No.  Oh, see the funny stuff, and then I told, ah.  Well, I think one of our boss and listeners actually taped it, and we're going to get  the tape, and we'll play it tomorrow or something, or later today.  And then I, ah, I was telling, ah, they were asking about my daughter, and I said she goes  out with some horrible kid named Willie Burr.  Oh, really?  Willie Burr.  Oh, you're doing inside jokes.  That's, that's good.  And, ah, whatever, so.  Dude, you got to understand, our pests are everywhere.  We had no idea you were in Boston.  Also, one of the pests called up and said, hey, dude, uh, Voss is on in Boston, you want 
[01:17:30]  to listen?  I'm like, yeah, definitely.  Well, it started, I mean, you know how these interviews, you're in for 10, 15 minutes,  whatever.  It was, it was all right.  Ah, but I knew if I would have picked up, it would have just been another radio bridge  I burned.  Ah.  You did fine.  What are you doing in Boston?  I'm doing a Comedy Connection.  Oh, I'm doing it.  With good old Bill Blumenreich.  Yeah, Friday and Saturday.  Well, I haven't seen you since New Year's Eve.  And what a great show that was.  Yeah, you guys kicked ass down there.  That was a lot of fun. 
[01:18:00]  Absolutely.  Everyone kicked ass down there for Norton's show.  Norton, uh, Colin Quinn, and Voss.  That was fun.  Who's in studio?  Uh, Patrice?  Yep.  Hi, honey bun.  What's up, sweetie?  Are you mad at me or something?  You know, you're not talking.  I'm just letting you fucking talk, asshole.  Jesus, you be, I never heard you talk for five minutes without saying Bonnie's name,  dickface.  I did say it.  You're enjoying it.  Yeah, I just wanted to hear, I just wanted to hear old Voss talk again when I was fucking  his wife.  I didn't say anything.  Plugging his wife.  I had my wife's panties today.  I bought her some new panties and fuck-a-puck-a-hook-a-setup. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, you're, you know, you suck.  Fuck-a-puck-a.  You know what?  You suck just all bit of life.  You're like a dick.  Hey, see, this is what I'm saying.  See, the old Voss would never say any shit like you suck.  See, I'm trying to be positive.  Shut up, Voss.  I want negativity, you motherfucking.  Give me some negativity.  Z-100 XL radio.  Shut up.  God damn it.  I just was enjoying you sounding like a goddamn grown man again for five seconds.  I am.  I'm not fucking, I didn't talk about any broads or anything. 
[01:19:00]  I didn't talk about my wife.  I'm talking about guy shit, you know?  I'm just a dude now.  You were talking about your wife having her period on, we heard you.  I did that one dumb bit.  No, you didn't.  You were talking about the HBO special she did.  And then you also talked about how she put her head on some stranger's.  That was a new bit, and it's funny.  It was a true story.  That's not the point, Voss.  The point is you just said you talk about guy stuff.  Well, here's the thing.  You know, if you can get the tape of me last week on radio, I just destroyed it. 
[01:19:30]  You know, look, three years on the road, I'm doing hundreds and hundreds of radio stations.  Sometimes you're into it, and sometimes you're not, and you just put it on autopilot.  You guys know that, all right?  I don't know that.  Because you don't work that much.  You know what?  I don't know what I thought about Patrice, Opie, and Anthony, but we were doing shows.  We did two shows.  They were sponsored by the ACLU fundraisers.  Yeah.  But ACLU, right?  Patrice, they said we can't use them on the second show. 
[01:20:00]  It was too offensive.  It was the ACLU who pushes the First Amendment.  Yeah, it was censored.  The ACLU defends Nazis.  And they defired that zero.  Pedophiles, everybody.  Yeah.  They want pedophiles taken off of the list and stuff.  He's pulling neutron bombs out on me.  Jesus, boss.  Jesus Christ.  Too offensive for the ACLU. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  That's like getting kicked out of Nambla for liking too many young boys.  I don't know.  I gave you credit on the radio when it was off air.  I was telling Anthony that I think that you're just happy because you just feel like this  is the first time in your life you feel like a responsible man.  Like you're doing all the things that men do.  You have a family.  You have a family.  You have a house.  Anxiety deems you a person now. 
[01:21:00]  Right.  And you're not like this rebel anymore.  You really feel like life is something that you should be a part of.  And I understand.  I gave you credit where credit's due.  Listen to me.  All right.  I had that feeling you're talking about with my first marriage.  Okay.  The whole week.  No, you didn't.  You was in a fog, you fucking junkie.  We're talking about now.  We're talking about sober balls.  Now I'm getting old and lonely.  There's a difference between old and lonely.  And, you know, how many times can you take some snaggletooth waitress from a comedy club 
[01:21:30]  behind a dumpster and eat for a pill?  She's a fucking crack.  Jesus, boss.  He's a hopeless romantic, isn't he?  Oh, did you bring her flowers?  Hold on.  Snaggletooth.  Hold on.  Did you give her unpeeled bananas?  Let him talk.  He's on a roll here.  You know, so I mean, it's just, you know, you get to be my age.  You just want a little security.  Someone who might, you know, be able to.  So it wasn't about love.  No, I love her.  I'm going to call you out on that, boss.  I'm in love. 
[01:22:00]  Are you kidding me?  Let me tell you something, too.  If I didn't have her, if I knew about this whole MySpace thing before I met her, all these  hot broads, what are you kidding me?  You're getting a lot of MySpace girls?  Yeah, they always, can I be your friend?  Can I be your friend?  Yeah, you could be my friend.  Yeah, of course.  You could be my friend.  How many friends you got?  It's fake friendship.  I hate MySpace.  How many friends?  I got like 4,000.  I used to get more when Anthony had me in his top eight. 
[01:22:30]  Oh, shit.  You took them off.  I switched my top eight around.  I switched it up.  I had the soldiers on for a couple weeks.  Anthony put...  I had no black people on the top eight ever.  Is that true?  You've never had a black person on your top eight.  Jesus, let me think.  I think you're right.  I think you need to go home today and make all your top eight shwuggies.  I will, for the...  You know something?  Wait a minute.  Should be for the month of February, but it's close enough. 
[01:23:00]  Okay, I will have an entire black top eight for Black History Month.  Oh, man.  That's going to be sweating at home.  You have to figure it out.  I hope I can find eight.  I have 10,000...  Over 10,000 friends.  I think I've denied every black person.  And they have to be black.  Really?  Not Halle Berry black.  They've got to be...  They've got to be...  They've got to be...  They've got to be...  They've got to be Mickey Rivers black.  They've got to be any black, motherfucker. 
[01:23:30]  Any shade of black.  They've got to be Manute Bowl black.  I want to see black.  You can't go from zero to 60.  I want it to be so black you can barely see their faces.  Let them crawl before he walks.  Yeah, come on.  My top eight looks like Greenwich.  Jesus, there has to be some racial mixing in there somewhere.  Just something.  Can't make it.  You put some trees in your top eight, you only need four more.  Nothing. 
[01:24:00]  It was going so good.  I was doing so good.  It really was.  Good old boss.  It was going good.  Don't cut me off because I have one bad one, all right?  When I have 10 good ones.  Well, they were telling us that you've got to go.  Yeah.  Who's telling you that?  You guys are telling you that.  You guys are telling you that.  You know what?  No.  It says right here, boss has to go.  You have to do another interview or something.  I don't know.  I don't know what your people are getting at.  You can kick me off and you can do all that, but I'm going to be big again this year.  This is my year, pal. 
[01:24:30]  Your year?  You know what?  Yeah, I got big fucking cooking.  Last comic standing is back again, too, boss.  You know that?  Yeah, I know.  I heard.  Boss, what do you have cooking?  We should get that out of the way.  I got nothing.  Oh, he is pissed right now.  He is pissed.  Staring into his phone.  Stump it out.  Bastard fuck.  Oh, good old boss.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Hey, Anthony, what's in cigarettes?  Nicotine.  Hey, Anthony, what's in cigarettes? 
[01:25:00]  Kevin wants to know from Connecticut.  Okay, that was a character I was doing.  It was 1940s guy.  And I feel it was this guy.  No time on nicotine here in Lucky Strike cigarettes.  The cigarettes that won the war for America.  See, he's now racist because he does it in characters.  Because he does it in character.  What a tricky ass fuck.  I do it in character. 
[01:25:30]  It's low in nicotine and tar, baby.  That old gag brought back one more time.  By the way, everyone is raving about your history channel, Reed.  Can we get that?  Isolate or do you have that before we go to break?  They want you to do it in your 1940s voice?  Yeah, the 40s voice.  Apparently, there's one for Air America, too, that airs on the platform.  That I did the whole thing in the old 40 guy voice. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, well, you know what?  We'll find that and we'll play it when we get back from break.  All right.  I know, E-Rock, he's got it.  E-Rock?  What a dude.  Why do you upset Opie like this?  I know he's got it.  I know Derek is good and he's going to find it.  It was my way of just maybe making people go, ah, I want to hear that.  So instead of going to the 80s channel, I'll give these guys another 20 minutes or so.  I bring nothing to the table.  Exactly.  That's right, E-Rock.  With that, Patrice O'Neill in studio and we'll continue.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:26:30]  Running with the devil.  I'm going to take more time.  Yeah, with the devil.  Yes, I am.  Yeah.  Hayseed Dixie.  Dixie.  Doing the classics.  For all our southern friends. 
[01:27:00]  For all our country fans.  Yes, no.  We don't understand the country.  Sorry.  We try.  We just don't get it.  There's like hardcore country fans that listen to this program.  And we got nothing for you.  I'm sorry.  We just don't get it.  We don't understand it.  I used to.  I'm tired of your fucking city slickers and your whole shit. 
[01:27:30]  I couldn't tell you the top country song in America.  I couldn't even get one of them.  No.  I couldn't even get one of the top ten.  It kind of crossed over for a little while when Garth Brooks was big.  Right.  It was a big country crossover.  Remember?  Like all of a sudden somebody you knew started wearing cowboy boots.  I was more of an achy breaky heart guy.  You.  No, I'm just kidding, bud.  My girl lost her foot in a lawnmower accident.  That's number one.  That's the number one song?  By Bootny. 
[01:28:00]  By Bootny Carnesby.  Billy Bob.  By Billy Bob Russell.  My girl lost her foot.  Hello, I'm Billy Bob Russell.  Give me the top ten country songs in America and we'll do a little riffing.  I was into the country way back when, when I was growing up, because I was out west and  I rode horses.  So my father always had it on in the truck.  But that was your old school country. 
[01:28:30]  You know, your little red Atlanta shit.  But everybody liked that old school country.  Old school country was like super crossover.  Like, you know, you just, you know, old school country songs because they're not really like  country kind of thing.  Yeah, it was, it was pretty, it was like, I think the big crossover back then was the  Stand By Your Man.  Stand by your man.  Or the Colt Mine's Daughter.  Don't matter who he's fucking.  Just keep on sucking on his cock. 
[01:29:00]  That was the whole song.  Stand by him, don't matter what he does.  Islands in the Stream.  Yeah.  Fucking anything by Charlie Pryde.  He might punch you in the face, but stand by your man.  Show the world you love him.  And they throw him bottles at the fucking screens on front of the stage.  Roll him up.  Pull him up.  Pull him up.  Big fight.  Roll hide.  Hit him up.  Yeah.  There was some big country songs back then. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Now I don't even know who the fuck is.  Iggy Break Your Heart was the last thing that crossed over into my.  You would know Garth Brooks' songs, wouldn't you?  I know not one.  No?  Whatever his most famous song is that I should know, I probably don't know it.  Really?  But Iggy Break Your Heart, I knew.  What's like Garth?  What was Garth's biggest hit?  What was his biggest hit song?  I don't know.  You don't even know?  Well, maybe Patrice wouldn't know.  Patrice knows a lot about white culture, though.  I'm from Boston, dude.  You really studied it.  And I'm corny.  I have a corny streak where it's like. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah.  A lot of that shit is just like.  I do like.  It scares me sometimes.  I think maybe you're a spy.  The only problem I have is calling it a culture.  Oh, real?  What are the top ten country songs?  We just want to go over the list.  No culture.  I just like hearing what y'all did with our shit and turning it into your shit.  Yeah.  That's pretty interesting.  All right.  We love stealing from the black man.  This is really the number one song in country music, huh?  Let's start with number ten. 
[01:30:30]  Are these albums or?  Or songs.  Songs.  Songs?  Does Derek have the list?  Maybe we can play a few of these.  Number ten.  Top country song in America right now.  Is the house next door to me was so.  What?  No.  No, that isn't.  And Garth Brooks is on the list.  He's still doing shit.  Man, there's country fans right now laughing at us.  Tim McGraw.  I heard of Tim McGraw.  Yeah.  He's like one of those guys who's big enough to have crossed over into my ears. 
[01:31:00]  But I don't know his songs, though.  George Strait.  Do you know George Strait?  Well, I got.  Man, fuck all that.  Get to the.  All right.  Well, I got it.  The number ten country song in America.  Here it is.  A little taste.  Yeah, that's not it.  God damn, motherfucker.  What is that shit?  What happened?  Just wrecked my own fucking shit.  You ruined your bit.  God damn it. 
[01:31:30]  Is this the chick from fucking.  Yes, it is.  Are you serious?  Yes, it is.  She's got the number one country song in America.  Wow.  Harry Underwood.  You're joking.  All right.  The number ten country song in America.  You got it, Derek?  Oh, it's awful.  I've heard this one, right?  You know this one?  Yeah.  A band called Little Big Town, and the song is called Boondocks.  I meant Carrie Underwood's song.  Oh.  Yeah.  Let's hear this.  This is the number ten country song in America.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow. 
[01:32:00]  Let's hear it, boys.  This is good cousin fucking music.  It's a boondock.  It's a boondock.  And I can feel that muddy water running through my veins. 
[01:32:30]  I can feel the muddy water running through my veins.  I can feel the muddy water running through my veins.  Reuben Kincaid should be right around the corner in a minute to manage this.  Yeah.  Manage this.  White people stealing from black people again.  Boondocks is our term.  That's a black man's term.  Boondocks.  The boonies.  That's number ten.  The boonies.  Got the muddy water running through his veins. 
[01:33:00]  I'm with Patrice on that.  I was kind of feeling it up until that harmony kicked in.  And then it got a little corny.  All right.  Shields and that.  Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Sha-na-na-na-na-na.  Let's go with number nine.  Top country songs in America.  We're trying to educate ourselves.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  And our listeners out there.  It's very good of us.  There's a band called Sugar Land.  No clue.  And the song is called Just Might Make Me Believe. 
[01:33:30]  Going for the heartstrings.  Yeah.  I got miles of trouble spreading far and wide.  Bill's on the table getting higher and higher.  There's always a problem.  Just keep on coming.  There ain't no end in sight. 
[01:34:00]  That's what Bill's due.  No end in sight.  I'm just holding on.  I might have to sell her body soon.  She's holding on.  I got someone who loves me more than words can say.  Oh, boy.  And I'm thankful for that each and every day.  But it can't pay the fucking bills.  He loves you because you have a tight snatch.  That's about it.  There's no other reason to love you, baby. 
[01:34:30]  Who are you kidding?  Still is hard to find faith.  Here it comes.  But if you can look in the hand.  Now, what's the definitive thing that makes this genre what it is?  Like, what is the thing that makes this country music?  What is that thing?  You know how rap is like?  It's obvious.  You know, hip-hop is like, you know, a good downbeat and a rap. 
[01:35:00]  You know, whatever.  But what's the definitive?  A relatable story.  But no.  It's all about relating.  It's a sound.  What's the sound like?  Is it that draw?  That line?  A steel guitar is important.  Some kind of like.  No, I think it comes.  Plotting, beat like this.  I think it's all about the lyrics and the story first.  But you can put these lyrics to.  Because this doesn't sound like a country song.  Yeah, but it is.  You can hear country.  You can just hear it.  It's not like a pop.  Listen to the background. 
[01:35:30]  Listen to background music.  It's that, like, bluesy thing going on.  Yeah, most country songs, I'm sorry, are essentially mechanically the same song.  You know, like they're constructed the same in terms of the way the chord progressions go.  It's the story that is crafted around.  So, Oop's right.  But you could put the story and the lyrics to a hard rock song.  You're absolutely right.  And it's not country.  Right, and it's not country anymore. 
[01:36:00]  Well, Leonard Skinner had that thing, but when I listen to Free Bird, I don't feel like I went over.  This is if I leave here.  It doesn't sound like this.  It's got southern roots in it, that whole Leonard Skinner thing.  And so does country.  It's a very bluesy.  It's the mechanics of the song.  What was that song about anyway?  I don't know.  She can't pay her bills.  She's kind of like just holding on.  And this person she's in love with is the one that's going to make her believe everything will be okay.  Because it's not about money and all that. 
[01:36:30]  She's happy to be mediocre.  Yeah.  But then she drinks her margaritas to kind of make things...  Who doesn't?  All right.  Let's go on.  Drunk mediocrity.  That's what that song is about.  Let's go on to number eight.  There's a bit here somewhere.  We're going to try to find our way in the middle of this here.  Top ten country songs in America.  Number eight is a guy named Dierks.  Dierks Bentley.  I'm Dierks Bentley.  I'm listening to my album, Coming Little Closer. 
[01:37:00]  All right.  All right.  Dierks Bentley, pleasure to meet you.  You think the truckers in Alabama just got, go ahead, fellas.  And they're just driving down.  How they go, man, these guys, they're just multi-multi-culture.  And just this horse shit, and they're looking up into space, fucking somewhere still dark  in fucking Utah, and they're fucking driving down, going, man, don't you make fun of the  girl from Sugar Land?  Right.  Bitchy McGillicuddy, she's a beautiful woman.  That was my goddamn wedding song, you motherfuckers. 
[01:37:30]  How about we play a little game?  Dierks Bentley, come a little closer.  What do you think this song is about?  Well, it's an alien from outer space.  And Dierks Bentley teams up with other people in the squad, and they kill the alien.  I'm Dierks Bentley.  Dierks Bentley.  Dierks.  Dierks, get to the chopper.  Get down.  Get down, Dierks.  Come on, Dierks, do it now. 
[01:38:00]  All right, so what has come a little closer about?  Come a little closer?  Self-explanatory.  Yeah, a little love thing going on.  He's, okay, ready, it's a girl.  Mm-hmm, yeah.  It's a girl who he's been trying to get for a long time, and he just wants her to, she's  wary, because this is now, it's 2006, bitches are wary of man love.  God damn, this guy's, this was exactly what I was going to say.  She's wary of man love, and he's just like, look, I understand that you're a little nervous,  and you think I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing, but I love you. 
[01:38:30]  And you'll see that, you'll see that, if you just come a little closer, you see that  I'm Dierks Bentley.  So that's what it's about, you think?  That's what I say.  Yeah.  All right, let's listen to Dierks Bentley.  Come a little closer.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  Oh. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, it's Pink Floyd.  Welcome to Shoe Machine.  All right.  Come a little closer, baby.  I feel like laying you down.  Ooh.  He's coming for the blue knot.  Date and rape song.  All a bit of sweet surrender. 
[01:39:30]  Well, we can work it all out.  Work it all out?  Uh-oh, what's the problem?  This guy stinks.  You should tell us the problem right here.  Let's listen to what the problem is.  There ain't nothing that love can't fix.  Okay.  Girl, it's right here at our fingertips.  I thought it was going to be Dicks.  So come a little closer, baby.  I feel like laying you down.  Laying you down? 
[01:40:00]  I feel like laying you out.  Just be more accurate.  Come a little closer, baby.  Here's another verse.  I feel like letting go.  He's got a big jar of Vaseline.  He's going to punch her in the asshole.  Of everything that stands between us.  What's the problem?  And the love we used to know.  Ah, the problem.  They were in love.  Rediscovered each other.  I want to touch you like a cleansing rain. 
[01:40:30]  And let it wash all the hurt away.  All right.  I got it.  All right.  Pause this.  Pause it for a second.  Here's what the problem is.  Yeah.  We were thinking too complex, Patrice.  Yeah.  Here's the problem.  They got all kinds of problems and issues.  They were in love, but this guy probably sounds like an asshole.  Yeah.  Maybe cheated.  Probably did a little cheating.  Hit her a little bit.  With the waitress down at the Greasy Spoon.  Right.  The Greasy Spoon.  She's willing to give up the blue knot and this little filly isn't. 
[01:41:00]  And in his simple Dierks Bentley mind, he thinks, once I fuck you, it's all going to be fine again.  Like, I know we got problems, baby, but just get in the bed.  Wait a minute, Anthony.  Get in the bed.  I learned a thing or two from the waitress down at the Greasy Spoon.  I'm going to show you what I learned.  You got to take calls from the actual motherfuckers who know.  Who know this stuff.  Who actually know what Dierks is talking about.  Dierks Bentley, come a little closer.  I'll even lick your ass.  You got to go, man, you don't have a goddamn clue what he's talking about. 
[01:41:30]  What he's saying is.  Well, let's see what Ken in New York has to say.  Ken, you know this song at all?  Hello?  Hi.  Do you know what Dierks Bentley is talking about in Come a Little Closer?  No, not really.  But I got to defend this country music, guys.  We're not bashing country.  We're really not.  Well, it's basically telling you we have no fucking clue what it's about.  We're kind of like little big town boondocks until they sound like the Partridge family.  You know what, guys?  I'm from New York, born and raised, and I got into country music three or four years ago.  I can just fucking identify it with it. 
[01:42:00]  I don't know what.  I can't even explain it myself.  Oh, really?  Thank you.  I want to go to Ty in Alabama.  Ty?  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, y'all boys taking this shit a little bit too far now, ain't you?  Damn.  It's all right.  We all messing with the spook up there.  No.  I'm fucking with my music.  See?  The second we hit the Midwest, it's over, Johnny.  They can't take the joke out.  I love when you're with the Puerto Ricans this morning and the Mexicans.  That shit's funny. 
[01:42:30]  Hey, you got to call a spade a spade and a chicka chicka.  But you can't mess with Dierks.  See, if I was a listener to this program, I'd be enjoying how clueless your pals Opie,  Anthony, and Patrice are when it comes to country music.  Well, the whole thing is, his name's Dierks Bentley.  It ain't Dierks, it's Dierks.  Oh, Dierks.  Dierks to us.  He spells it D-I-E-R-K-S.  I'm Dierks Bentley.  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't really matter.  All right, wait. 
[01:43:00]  Well, we got to find out what's going on.  I think there's more to this story.  So, thank you, Ty.  Ty, thank you.  I'll talk to you now.  All right, don't take it seriously, though.  We understand that it's someone's music out there, but we're just trying to tell you we  have no fucking idea.  Hey, look, if we was on here just trying to deconstruct rap, okay?  Right.  Motherfucker, they'll be out there.  All right, dude, let's do that.  Are you in tomorrow?  Yeah.  All right, we'll do that.  Let me tell you, I can never understand what them nodders are saying.  Exactly.  That's who you get, but you're fucking that country music.  We're trying to teach it, right? 
[01:43:30]  We're trying to learn.  I'm trying to learn about this goofy-ass music.  I'm going to be educated.  All right, tomorrow we'll do the opposite.  We've got to find the top ten rap songs in America.  Right.  Deconstructed, I'll tell you what else.  We just need something.  I'll do it right now.  I don't even have to hear the songs.  Four of them, somebody's getting smacked, and three of them, somebody's getting shot.  That's right.  Somebody's getting shot, and somebody's getting...  And then in between, he's going to talk about his rims, and his fucking gold around  his neck, and his gold fingers.  Oh, wait a minute.  Okay, if you're going to say that, I bet you there's a running theme in this horse shit, 
[01:44:00]  too.  All right.  There must be a running theme into this.  You're right.  All right, let's get back to Come a Little Closer.  Zerks or Dierks Bentley.  Zerks Bentley.  Let's get back to the song.  Come a Little Closer, baby.  Yeah.  I feel like letting go.  Letting go.  So got it.  Of everything that stands between us and the love we used to know. 
[01:44:30]  All right.  You're going to fix it.  I want to touch you like a cleansing ray.  Cleansing ray.  Let it wash all the hurt away.  Oh, this guy fucked her up.  So come a little closer, baby.  And now he wants her back.  He's going to fix it by fucking her.  What a guy.  What a guy.  What a trooper.  Let's forget about all that shit I did to you. 
[01:45:00]  How you feel now?  Remember the good banging I used to give you.  All right.  That's enough of that little ditty there.  There's Dierks Bentley.  Come a Little Closer.  Some guy is just.  And they don't want us to talk over because some guy is just going, man, you know.  I feel like this song.  Man, what a great song.  Who's the pig with the hottest?  Let's say, let's move on to the next guy.  Let's. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, that is a big guy.  He is big.  Did Patrice just fall on the floor?  Yeah, Patrice just fell on the floor.  He actually.  See, his evil Opie comes out.  Patrice, you all right?  Oh, fuck me.  Get up off the floor, man.  We can't pick you up if there's a problem.  Oh, I'm sorry.  What's wrong, man?  Oh, my God.  It's just perfectly said what it is. 
[01:46:00]  This fat face with all these chins.  What is he, the support team?  All right.  We'll get into the hotness that's outside the studio in a little bit.  But we're in the middle of a fine, fine bit here.  Top country songs in America.  Number seven is good old Garth Brooks.  Yeah.  And Good Ride Cowboy.  All right.  What's this song about?  Oh, hold up.  We got to figure it out?  Yeah, we got to figure it out.  Yeah.  But it's Garth, so it's probably just about being a cowboy. 
[01:46:30]  Just having a good time.  Yeah.  Good time.  Fun.  Oh, it sounds fun already.  Nothing bothers me.  From the hills of Casey Whiteholding, where life's fully and wild.  Came a navy brat in a cowboy hat and that cold win a Hagen smile.  Yeah.  And from the Bronx, honky-tonk, she always sang a cowboy song. 
[01:47:00]  We were much too young, having too much fun, as we all sang along.  And we sang a lot, say highway.  There's only one way you're going to get through.  And when she starts to twist, be more like Chris.  Pull your hat down tight.  And just look, do it when that whistle blows.  And the crowd explodes, and him, he comes in a Hagen smile.  All right.  I don't get it.  That's a nice, that's one of those things they do, their variation of the electric slide. 
[01:47:30]  What do those crackers do?  What do they call it?  Line dance.  Line dance.  No, that's a little crack of line dance song.  Where they, like, lift their boot and give it a tap with their foot.  And then all turn.  And the girls with the skirts and the cowboy boots.  The skirts and the bunts.  Hernda's hairdos, but little knees, tickle, tickle feet.  Fucking, a good countdown.  Make me like this shit.  Right. 
[01:48:00]  Sell it.  Don't just come and go, oh, watch your mouth, man, nigga.  Make up.  That song sounded fun, that's all.  Steve, Steve knows what that song's about.  Steve likes fucking country, huh?  I do.  That was, I think that's a tribute song to the late Chris Ledoux, who died of cancer last year, I believe.  Who was he?  Chris Ledoux was another singer.  He was a good old cowboy.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm Chris Ledoux.  All right, we're going to move on, because we want to try to get through this here.  Number six, top country songs in America. 
[01:48:30]  You sold out Chris Ledoux.  We're trying to educate ourselves here today.  Oh, I can't get enough of that shit.  I love Arnold.  Let's say hi to Tim McGraw.  Tim McGraw.  My old friend.  What's my old friend about?  His dog.  This could be, oh, very good, his dog.  His dog.  This could be, now, Tim McGraw, son of Tug McGraw.  Right.  Tug died, I guess they hadn't known each other for a long time.  This could be a father about his dad. 
[01:49:00]  About his dad.  My old friend.  I'd say it's about an inanimate object.  It's not a human.  It's either a truck.  Yeah.  His favorite truck.  His fucking dog.  Yeah.  Maybe his, I don't know Tug, I don't know Tim that well.  I would say his gun or something, but probably not his gun.  Not his gun.  But something like a truck.  His old friend that never lets him down.  Yeah.  And it's never a human being that never lets you down.  All right.  Wow.  It's always something else that lets, humans let you down, but not your fucking, not your 
[01:49:30]  old.  Not your old.  Your old board, your old Chevy.  Your old thing with the thing in there.  Right.  And over there.  So you're saying some type of machine thing.  Ope is saying somebody that's his old hound dog, and I'm saying it's going to be maybe  dear old dad.  That has nothing to do with a woman, right?  No woman.  No, no woman in this one.  Tim McGraw, my old friend.  Let's take a listen.  A little up-tempo.  A little up-tempo. 
[01:50:00]  A little up-tempo.  A little up-tempo.  My old friend.  I recall the times we had hanging on my wall.  I wouldn't trade.  Maybe it's just about his old friend.  Them for gold.  That's what I'm saying.  But they laugh and they cry me. 
[01:50:30]  They somehow sacrifice me.  The war burning, the stories I have told.  Until again.  My old friend.  I apologize.  For the years that have passed since the last time you and I dusted all.  There's memories.  Just an old friend.  Running at the race.  Now, Patrice.  I pause it. 
[01:51:00]  Pause it.  Patrice got something.  I'm telling you.  Listen.  It's hanging on his wall.  He's being clever.  It was since I dusted off.  No one dusts off their fucking buddy.  You understand?  He dusted off the thing.  It's a thing.  I'm telling you.  You think it's still going to be a thing?  I don't fucking know.  It's hanging on a wall.  Maybe in the chorus he talks about it.  Maybe it's pictures of memories of him and a friend.  I think it's his old friend that he just doesn't call anymore.  Just a buddy?  No.  Maybe we're overthinking it again.  Maybe a friend, he doesn't know how to quit. 
[01:51:30]  I don't know how to quit you.  You know what?  If this...  When we was on Brokeback Mountain, I was fucking you in the ass.  If this doesn't turn into something clever that, like you said, making...  Then the rest of these songs, whatever it says, if it says Sugar Land, I want to say  it's about sugar.  All right.  No more credit to country music if this motherfucker's talking about just his buddy.  All right.  Let's hear.  Let's go.  Back to my old friend.  There's always somewhere else I had to be. 
[01:52:00]  Time gets thin.  My old friend.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  Oh, he don't know why.  Uh-huh.  I don't know why. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, someone's saying it's a deer head.  On his wall.  Done.  Done with that.  Who cares?  It didn't even say what.  I think it's about the fact that Tim used to have some fine friends, and then he became  this huge country superstar and kind of didn't forget about his friends but didn't have time  for his friends because he was too busy traveling America and becoming this huge country star  and realized, oh my God, my old friend. 
[01:53:00]  My old friend.  He would never run so much.  My old friend.  My old friend.  He had a kid to some guys that he left because he got famous.  Could be.  I don't know.  Jesus.  He didn't say anything.  It was vague.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And if that was to his old friends, they're so vague, they wouldn't sit there and go,  ah, Tim, remember me.  It's like, who the fuck is he talking about?  Who?  What?  All right.  Let's go to number five.  Top country songs in America.  Brad Paisley featuring Dolly Parton.  Holy shit.  Brad Paisley. 
[01:53:30]  Hello.  I'm Brad Paisley.  Pleasure to meet you.  Arnold, what is this song about?  This is called When I Get Where I'm Going, I'm Going to Kill Something featuring Dolly Parton.  Really?  Dolly Parton's in this one?  Yeah.  When I Get Where I'm Going, what's this about?  Where I get, when I get where I'm going.  Is it a physical trip or is it something that's going on?  I'm going to keep it simple.  Spiritual. 
[01:54:00]  It's a spiritual trip.  I got to get, I still give it credit.  Come on.  Come on, country music.  Guy's a trucker and he's hauling something and when he gets where he's going, I'm going  to get paid and buy some beer.  I'm on Route 66, headed to Route 82, that's where I'm going.  And when I get there, I get paid.  I get paid.  Meow, meow, meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  Well, my Peter Belt is running. 
[01:54:30]  When I get where I'm going.  When I get where I'm going.  All right.  It's a spiritual journey he's on.  I'm thinking.  I'll say spiritual.  Spiritual.  Spiritual.  Spiritual.  When I get where I'm going.  On the far side of the sky. 
[01:55:00]  The first thing that I'm going to do is spread my wings and fly.  I'm going to land beside a lion.  Run my fingers through his mane.  Or I might find out what it's like to ride a drop of rain.  Yeah, when I get where I'm going.  There'll be only happy tears. 
[01:55:30]  I will shed the sins and struggles I have carried all these years.  And I'll leave my heart wide open.  I will love and have no fear.  Yeah, when I get where I'm going.  Don't cry for me down here. 
[01:56:00]  I'm going to walk with my granddaddy.  Oh, he's got cancer.  Oh, boy.  Oh, he's got the big C.  Oh, fuck it.  Come on, man.  God damn.  Don't say that.  He's giving a positive spin to cancer.  Oh, fucking way.  Essentially, he's going to be up there with granddaddy.  And I'll hug his neck.  Yeah, when I get where I'm going.  There'll be only happy tears. 
[01:56:30]  See, because usually the sad tears when a loved one dies.  But don't worry about him.  He's going to be all right.  I didn't see this guy.  He's going to be with granddaddy.  All right.  All right.  Enough of the cancer song.  That guy's not dying.  That's a dying song.  Let's go to Amanda in Brooklyn.  Amanda.  Good morning.  What's the Brad Paisley Dolly Parton song all about?  Well, usually the newer country stars like to link up with an old one to do some type of tribute song or something like that.  And it's pretty much about going to heaven and what it's going to be like. 
[01:57:00]  It's pretty basic.  That one's an easy one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's not dying.  No, just talk about what it's going to be like when you get there just dreaming about it, I think.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Yeah, I know.  Pretty depressing.  All right.  Thank you, Amanda.  Thanks.  Have a good one.  All right.  Let's move on to number four here.  We're almost done.  Billy Carrington.  Billy Carrington.  That was a movie I did in 96.  I was Billy Carrington. 
[01:57:30]  The song is called Must Be Doing Something Right.  Must Be Doing Something Right.  This is him counting his blessings.  Yep.  This is what it is.  This is an absolute love song.  I got a girl.  She's wonderful.  He's maybe got a good career.  He's got this.  I must be doing something right.  Life is good.  Right.  It's just about the love of his life.  Just a girl?  You think it's just a girl?  Just a girl.  Must be doing something right.  Absolutely just about a girl.  All right.  That's good.  I say it's general blessing. 
[01:58:00]  General blessing?  Yep.  I say it's general blessing.  He's got to be in the position he's in.  Because you never heard of it.  This guy's new.  And it's like thank you to show business for letting him do his dream.  Uh-huh.  No girl.  All right.  There's no girl involved.  Not a girl.  I'm saying this is all about a love life.  Okay.  Must be doing something right.  Billy Carrington, everyone.  A woman is a mystery 
[01:58:30]  That I just can't understand  Sometimes all it takes to please her  Here's the touch of your hand  Yeah, the back of it  Other times you gotta take it slow

[02:18:00]  You just lost it  Lost it all  Just let  You gotta  Put your faith in God  Doesn't it sound like  It should be that  That's not it  No  It's literal  It's literal  It's literal  Jesus  Grab the wheel  Why  I can't fucking drive  It's a tribute  To her  She got all fucked up  Her American Idol thing  It's a tribute to  Like her dreams coming true  No no  I mean  I'm driving  I'm fucking  You take the wheel  From me  Why  The car is skidding  But is she  Jesus  Jesus 
[02:18:30]  Oh literally  Jesus  Get on the Antilock brakes  So there's a Puerto Rican  In the car  Really  This is Jesus  Take the wheel  I have no idea  You don't know what it's about  I'm saying it's literal  No  Jesus  Take the wheel  Her life  No  Needs a little  Spiritual help  Not needs  Jesus put it in  Four wheel drive  This is a thank you  It's snowing  She already had her help  This is a thank you  She doesn't  This bitch is not coming out  Saying it  You're trying to tell me  That Jesus is a designated driver  Jesus my tranny lights on  What do I do 
[02:19:00]  Jesus I need oil  It's about  Jesus take the wheel  Jesus check the alternating  Jesus slow down  You're making me nervous  You're driving too fast  You might be immortal  But I could still hurt my ass  We like leaving on an up note  But this is going to be  Very obvious  Very boring  And we're just going to have to  You might be immortal  You might be immortal  You're alright 
[02:19:30]  But I'm scared shitless  Here in the left hand lane  You drive like you're insane  Jesus  This is going to be like  This is going to be like  That dumb poem  With the four fucking footprints  Footprints  And then there's two  And where were you  When I really needed you  Well that's when I was carrying you  That's what this song is all about  So so far  What is  Would you agree with this list  Would you reverse anything  Put anything  We don't know  It's all the same to me  This is the same  Same stuff 
[02:20:00]  I think Billy Curranton  I think Billy Curranton  Is good  Well let's go to  Carry on to  And get this over with  Jesus Take the Wheel  Number one country song  In America  Oof  A little violin in there  It's nice right  She was driving last Friday  On her way to Cincinnati  On a snow white prison scene  Here you go 
[02:20:30]  Going home to see her mama  And her daddy  With the baby in the back seat  Baby's in the back seat  Fifty miles to go  When she was running low  And it's going to nail this one  Here we go  She's giving false hope to people  Been long  She had a lot on her mind  And she didn't pay attention  She was going way too fast  Too fast  Before she knew it  She was spinning on a thin black sheet of glass  Black ice  She saw both her lips flash before her eyes 
[02:21:00]  She didn't even have time to cry  She was so sad  She threw her hands up in the air  Oh, that's real smart  Jesus Take the Wheel  Jesus Take the Wheel  Did he take the wheel though?  Did he take the goddamn wheel?  Let's listen and find out  No, apparently not  Wow, man 
[02:21:30]  Wow  You know  Have a little survival instinct  And steer into the skid  You stupid bitch  Oh, wow  Stop giving false hope to everybody out there  With your number one song  Literally  Jesus Take the Wheel  Well, I believe  It's been a hard year  And literally  She wants, you know  Jesus Take the Wheel  But figuratively speaking  I think she's giving herself up to Jesus  Right here  At this moment  At a low point in her life  Oh, oh  Jesus Elber  This is the bitch that's from the last song 
[02:22:00]  The husband left  She's out whoring  See, now she's not skidding anymore  But she's still saying 
[02:22:30]  She has just surrendered her life to Jesus  And as far as her life goes  Does that work out?  No, that didn't work out either  It sounds like it worked out  It's a shame  Did she die in this song?  No  She made it  She believes in her faith  And look, it did her well  She sounds good though  I think she should  She can sing  I think she should pray to Goodyear Tire  Because that seemed to be what saved her in that situation  Jesus Take the  Carry Underwood  Maybe the bitch should stop putting on makeup as she drives 
[02:23:00]  This would have been alright  Jesus took the wheel  But there you go  The Lord and Savior  I have learned things  She had Jesus in her back pocket  Jesus pulled one of those like 180 moves  Spins a car, puts it back in drive  Jumped out the window, did a roll  Oh, it's great  Jumped over the drawbridge  Driving like it's the Italian job  Through the sewers  Jesus can drive  Jesus can listen to saves  See when it clicks  He's a save crank  This worked out very well 
[02:23:30]  So the listeners got to remind us to bring this bit back  When it's a whole bunch of brand new songs  Brand new ones  Because these songs will stay in that list for a long time  So maybe a couple months down the road  Where was Jesus when Dale Earnhardt was driving?  Holy shit  Where was Jesus then?  Jesus take the wheel  Nope  Nope  Sorry pal  Nope  I'm too busy saving some other bitch  That can't drive on a light sheet of ice  Sorry there  Number three  A lot of people are saying  Jesus take the wheel  Yeah, because Jesus made a joke 
[02:24:00]  She said take the wheel  He goes  You want me to come and shoot her?  Yeah, exactly  Why?  I was just joking  I tell her not to drive  Jesus take the wheel  No, I'm busy here  I made a little joke  Oh my god  That was good  Well, there was a couple of songs that I can get into  Yeah  Oh, the honky-tonk-padonk-padonk  Honky-tonk-padonk-padonk  I want to see the video  I can't  And a little boondock  A little big town with boondocks  She let herself go  Let's be honest, too  Let herself go  Evil self-go was good  Evil trucker from Dallas

[02:26:00]  Throw your hands in the  Boo  Yeah  Why don't you do us a little soft shoe  Do that  Hit him up  We're all hot  I got into one country song  On vacation  I was in the Grand Cayman Islands  And driving around with a rental  Trying to find anything to listen to on the radio  You've made enough excuses  I know, I know  Yeah  And it was just strange that there was a country station on the island  Because it's all  It's very dark  You boys don't 
[02:26:30]  Dark how?  Like the sun goes down dark?  Or the black people?  People are dark  Jesus  Hold on, you've got to know your audience  Are they all listening to country music?  Holy shit  And I was catching shit  I know, god damn  They're all dark  The island's too dark for a country station  Harlem is very dark  What?  With the lights out?  How many people you know listen to country music?  It's a chocolate island  I'm just saying  There's a lot of black people  I didn't understand  It was dark  In the beginning there was darkness  What?  A lot of niggas? 
[02:27:00]  So I was surprised that they had a country station  Because, you know, knowing radio  You've got to know your audience  Why would you throw a country station in the Grand Cayman Islands?  Well, like everybody says  There's not enough people that would listen to country music  You can relate to it  It's the story  All right  And there was a song called  Billy's Got His Beer Goggles On  That's the song I liked  Billy Got His Beer Goggles?  Billy Got His Beer Goggles On, yeah  It's got an island feel to it  They play this like  Oh, yeah 
[02:27:30]  Power rotate  The bar  He's been there all night  First ten beers he's had  Sends her goodbye  Hey  Honky-tonky  Donkey-donk  She left him broke  In his new truck  He don't smoke  But he lights one up  Temporary fix 
[02:28:00]  For his heartache  He's hurting bad  But he's feeling great  He's on the dance floor  Yelling free bird  Singing off pitch  But he knows every word  Grabs him a girl  And he holds on tight  He's chasing everything inside  He'll fall apart  He's the barred asshole  He gets home 
[02:28:30]  Right now his worries are gone  Life looks good, good, good  Billy's got his beer goggles on  Yeah  God damn it  Hey  Jesus Christ  Got all these problems  But he don't give a shit  He's fucked up  Oh my God  I wonder  See, this is what  This right now  Is so painful to think  That there, you know  There's a lot of white people  Out there  Or whoever  That when they listen to rap 
[02:29:00]  It just sounds the same  To them  As fucking this country shit  Sounds to me  Like it's just  Just that  And they just hear the same song  Over and over in their heads  And you don't want them to  You want them to love it  The girls have to leave at 10?  Yeah  Alright  We got some girls coming in  Yeah  Well we were gonna break  But if they have to leave at 10  These girls have been waiting  Outside the studio  Wondering we  Wondering why we  Didn't get them right in  Yeah  Wait, what?  There's a little  Wait, what happened?

[02:44:30]  You can't go by me  I'm a cheerleader  I have a real thing  When you're playing contact football  It's not about the nails  You're out there  It's about the sport  No it's about the oopsies  And this is going to be tackling  Tackling  Full on contact  What do you wear on your legs  Is it going to be  Knee pads  Like what do you got on under there  I see matching some  Jesus Christ  These are like little boy shorts  They are little boy shorts indeed  Indeed they are  Can we see an oopsie

[02:45:30]  I'm sorry  Thank you for coming in  You should be in this by the way  We appreciate having you  Thank you  Thank you  Alright  Bye guys  Sorry we got off on the wrong foot there  Yeah the wrong foot  The wrong foot  But the foot was in bounds  Give him a tongue lashing  Give him a tongue lashing  Well we  Bodog.net everybody  We'll visit Bodog.net  As soon as you leave the studio  Thank you ladies  And there they go  The girls in lingerie  I want to get this out of the way  Right now 
[02:46:00]  I bow to Patrice  Are you doing that  I absolutely bow  To you my friend  You're doing the slow clap  I bow to you  You saw something  And you went for it  I haven't seen  That vicious an attack  That quickly  He was like  You ever hear about the attacks  Where someone's standing there  And a pit bull  Who's all happy  And wagging its tail  Just lunges at someone's throat  That's in the room  That's what that reminded me of 
[02:46:30]  You can't see it dude  It's like  I'm not  Like you can go to Kreskin  But it's like  I just  It's just  You can feel that run through  Yeah  And it's just like  You can't feel that comfortable  Being that  Just  Because you  She did look good  But you can't feel comfortable  Coming here  Changing the mood  Because you know what  She was listening to us  For an hour  Be completely juvenile  And she just  She just was like  So you're saying  Yucky  You are either the nastiest 
[02:47:00]  Or the most insightful person  I've ever seen  I just  No  You didn't see that  I am so with Patrice on this  I didn't even see it  As soon as she walked in  With a winter coat  That was such a sign  It wasn't even funny  Like Patrice said  The other girl had kind of a coat on  But it was still sexy  And had something to do  With the lingerie action  I didn't notice  That girl had a winter coat  Like she was ready  To go down the slope  You know  You could be right  But I didn't even notice  And she almost  She pretty much had her  Like arms folded  She did not want to be 
[02:47:30]  In that situation  And the reason why  We don't have a lot of women  On the show lately  Is because of women  Just like her  Where they  They're like  They just want to go  Through the motions  Absolutely  Wow  The rest of the girls  Were lovely  I liked them  They played the role  They were having fun  Bye  I didn't say anything to  It's like  You're just surprised  Anthony  Because he jumped on her  So quickly  No because I didn't notice  Usually we will like  Kind of like  You know  We would have had to  Have talked to her 
[02:48:00]  A little bit  And then we would have been  Dude  We've been in that situation  And you talk to him  A little while  And then you go  Alright this chick  Just ain't into it  But you were like  Boo  No no  I saw some  Friggin brainwaves  No I saw it too  I saw it too  And when I was thinking  To myself  Like here we go again  And I'm gonna have to  Do a little  Evil Opie  I swear to god  But I thought  It was gonna be  10 or 15 minutes in  Where I finally  Would call her out  Or something  Evil Opie  Is Jesus  Compared to  The monster  We saw  I understand  That's what  Made it great 
[02:48:30]  And look at  Man  I swear to you  It's just  It's like the comfort zone  Yeah  To bring it down  It's just  You know  She needed that  It was a little medicine  It didn't taste right  No  You know  She'll feel better later  Cause she won't do that again  Are they gone?  Sort of  Are they out of  Earshot?  Sort of  I think Patrice  Needs to run out there  And give the one girl  A little  Como  Como  I'm getting all thumbs up  Como  I tell her  What?  I tell her  Oh okay 
[02:49:00]  The audio's off  Look let me say this then  Patrice  That was fan  Fucking  Someone  Someone has to play  Good cop  In order  In order to keep  Anyone in the room  But oh my god  When you unloaded on her  I was laughing  My ass off  Inside  God bless you  Patrice O'Neal  Oh my god  She just  The girl's name  By the way  Was Danielle Gamba  She's got a website  Danielle  Gamba.com  G-A-M-B-A 
[02:49:30]  Danielle  Gamba.com  20 years old  From Minnesota  20  She's just a baby  She's from Minnesota  Are you sure  She's from Minnesota  That theory stinks  Let me see the picture  They said  Because she's from California  She's cold  She moved out to California  To go to school  To become a makeup artist  And also to pursue  Modeling and dancing  Exotic  She didn't want to do it  Katie also enjoys  Going to see her  Favorite bands play  And loves to stay at home 
[02:50:00]  And watch movies  That's a helmet thing  To throw on your resume  She just didn't want to do it  I know a couple of movies  She shouldn't watch  But she left too fast  She left  She just left  Well we love  Bodog.net  Thanks for getting us  Yeah sorry Bodog  Well no that was  There was no reflection  On Bodog  Or the lingerie bowl  That was just a personal  Little observation  Patrice made  We're going to regroup  We've been talking  For an hour and a half straight  Are you kidding me?  You know that Howard  Is hinting that 
[02:50:30]  He's not going to do Fridays  Because  Because  Because there's not  Enough commercials  On his show  That he doesn't have  Enough material  To do five days a week  So he's already hinting  That came from him  Yeah he's already hinting  That's the reason why  He's going to do  Only four days a week  No because  Letterman does  Four days  And he wants to be  Like Letterman  It was part of his deal  To begin with  Part of his deal  It's less work  More money  But he's going to  Spin it and say that  No no it's because  Now that we're not 
[02:51:00]  Playing 25 minutes  Of commercials an hour  I'm giving you more radio  So I need to take  A day off every week  To kind of recharge  The batteries  Get out of here  And he only works  Nine months a year  Four days a week  Nine months a year  You made the right choice  By getting your XM  Trust me on that  Alright we're going  To take a break  When we get back  Something's going to happen  Yeah there's other  Stuff to go to  There's plenty of it  We have material  We do 
[02:51:30]  There's 20,000 CDs  In front of you  Alright we have  Stuff to go to  No we actually do  I'm just fucking  We got remixes  We got a great story  About a lady  That gave birth  She didn't even know  She was pregnant  It's an amazing story  Actually  See now I have to prove  We do have stuff  And American Idol stuff  There was a couple  Things worth talking about  Yeah they do that  Two nights in a row  The American Idol  And that country bit  Pulled it out of our asses  I liked it  Just kind of pulled it  Out of our asses  Some people  A little annoyed 
[02:52:00]  With the country music  Because they don't like it  Or something  But it's  Sorry  It's not a part of you  There's a lot of the Midwest  That does enjoy it  And the people  That even don't enjoy it  Might have enjoyed  Our little spin on it  We had to be  Brave enough  To give it a shot  And I think we did  Okay with that one  Sometimes it's just about  Learning and crossing  Cultural lines  And calling an attractive  Girl a cunt  And just things like that  Yeah but that is harsh bro  Because I say it so free  You know  She was an 11 
[02:52:30]  By the way  It's like you come here  And you're just free  Your mouth is free  And if you go on  The regular radio  You just go  Oh shit  How do I  Wait how do I do this again  Patrice  Don't ever lose that  I'll kill you  Patrice do you realize  This also  Do you realize  Probably when you first  Came on this very show  And I'm not talking  About any W  I'm talking about  Our XM show  That she was probably  In high school  Like that was  A baby girl  It's just  That was a little 
[02:53:00]  Baby girl  I don't hate  It's like  I hate  The entitlement  That she felt  To be how she was  She can't even  Go across the street  And get a drink  To feel better  She's not old enough  But she thinks  That that makes her  Somebody  But you know what  Bravo  I say the same thing  That every guy  Says to her in the street  They say to 40  Other women  In the next block  And she has to learn  How to be  A little bit  Bigger  Than how cute she is 
[02:53:30]  A little thicker skinned  Just better  You know what you did  She left  Because she felt entitled  She didn't want to be here  You felt it  You put the first wrinkle  On her face  She's been a kid  Loved  Like just looked at  And appreciated  Never had a bad thing said  She like scowled  And you put that  First wrinkle  In her face  The first wrinkle  On that 20 year old face  Oh Jesus  You know  You don't apologize  It just  I don't know  She's starting to realize 
[02:54:00]  That her hotness  Isn't going to get her  Through life  It's life  It's life  That you gave her  A life lesson  That's right  There you go  Thank you  I know  Because you know  In her head  She's like  I'll do the lingerie bowl  Because it's just  A matter of time  Before Hollywood  Discovers me  Yeah  And I'm on the next  You know  Charlize Theron  Or whatever  Hey there you go  Or Risa  Sometimes they got to  Take some hits  The reality is  She's not  She's going to hobnob  Because she's a makeup artist  She's going to talk  She's going to give a card out 
[02:54:30]  She's going to do this and that  Yeah  But that's what she did  And those girls  The other girls  Fucking know  I was right  They were so happy  I did that  Because not one face changed  They got happier  The one blonde  The last one that walked out  And she looked at you  And made that kind of like  Don't worry about it  Kind of thing  So  You were probably spot on  Yeah  With your assessment  I mean not only of the fact  That she didn't want to be here  But the fact that  The other girls all know it 
[02:55:00]  And that  So you're probably  She will dye her hair blonde  Everybody else comes here  Goofy blonde  You've got to be blonde  That's not the same one is it  What  Oh now she's saying  She's 22 years old  22  And the black girl  Has that speech  That she's always  Got ready  Oh yeah  To make up for  Miss fucking coat  Hey  She's a company girl  Danielle's interest  General  Comedy clubs  Not anymore  And collecting  Marilyn Monroe  Memorabilia  Booby booby  Is that her MySpace?  Casino  Other pictures?  Her favorite movies 
[02:55:30]  Casino  Blow  And The Ref  No  It's not  Single  Dating  She's straight  She's 5'4  No  Yes  Someday  In college  Model  Alright  You think  Patrice will make her  Top 8?  I don't think so 
[02:56:00]  Oh god  She doesn't have  That was a teeny  Bit of medicine  She'll be okay  If I ever meet her again  She'll say  I was the girl  That you  Blah blah blah blah  She'll be very mad  She'll want revenge  And I'll go look  Sometimes I do what I do  But don't you feel better  No one likes medicine  I gotta take medicine  And it tastes bad  She just had to take some  And she'll shake  She'll have to shake  She'll have some  What do you call them  Some diarrhea  Some symptoms  Symptoms  She'll have side effects  Side effects  To that

[03:01:00]  Is I knew he was  Going to do it  Alright  Jesus you bastards  I wasn't going to  Answer him  But just in case  He was going to compliment you  I gave him a  I gave him a  Well here's the  Story of the day  Everybody  Listen closely  Finally  Can't make this up  Don Parnell  Was told as a teenager  She could not have a baby  That's what she thought  For 16 years of her life  Until last Friday  Don says she never knew  She was pregnant  Doctors didn't know either 
[03:01:30]  Yeah she said she was  A bit depressed  Yeah she put on  A little bit of weight  But nothing tipped her off  Until she gave birth  To a baby girl  In her own bathroom  The baby's healthy  So is mom  Oh the things you do not know  Can't make this up  It was in the toilet  Yeah  Why didn't they say  In the toilet  In the toilet  Not just in the bathroom  In the toilet  She was  What a clunk  She was depressed  So she thought  She just put on some weight  She decides 
[03:02:00]  To go to the bathroom  She's feeling pains  She thought it was  Due to her chiropractor  Screwing something up  So she goes to the bathroom  To take a dump  And a baby  Falls out  Into the toilet  She ran to the bathroom  In excruciating pain  Right  Yeah you ever have the pains  Where you know  You got to go to the bathroom  So bad  Like the back of your thigh muscles  Feel like they're giving out  Yeah  Like that kind of pain  But it was labor  She sits on the toilet 
[03:02:30]  Did she know right away?  It came out in the toilet bowl  And she knew  She goes  Oh shit it's a baby  And how many pounds?  Like a regular baby  And where's the umbilical cord?  She stood up  Yeah it must have been  At that point  Yeah then you go  Oh boy  Either I'm really sick  Or I just had a baby  She's like I shit my colon out  Oh my god  My colon is  I just fell out  I gotta give up Taco Bell  My New Year's resolution  Oh my god  Heard a lot of crap stories  But I never heard one like this 
[03:03:00]  This is bad  This doesn't even sound right  I refuse to believe  That that can happen dude  Yeah I  Anytime you hear about these girls  That are pregnant  And don't know it  How old was she?  A little odd  I don't know  Cause I'm saying  I'm asking cause  That just sounds like  Something  Somebody will do  To cover up something  To go oh my god  I didn't know mommy  I didn't know  If she had been told  For the past 16 years  That she couldn't have a baby  I'm assuming she's in her 30s  Perhaps  Wait  Give me a break with that 
[03:03:30]  You don't know you have a fucking  I know if I have a  You know  I don't know if I'm clogged up  For a week  Like oh shit  Well at least  They took her to the hospital  And they're doing fine  That's what they said  They're doing fine  It's not like she  You know  Had it at a prom  And threw it in the garbage  Right  Like some teens do  Damn and then you got a story  To tell your kid  When he gets a little older  You think he can handle it  Yeah  How do you tell that  You know  Where was I  Well  I was in a warm bath  All our loved ones  Were around us  There was a doctor there

[03:04:30]  Kaplunk  And I pissed first  So you fell in my piss water  And I wiped  And I wiped  I just thought  It was one of those  Those ones  I just had to keep going  Who knew you  You're lucky  There wasn't an interesting article  In the magazine rack  Or you'd have drowned  Hey ma  What is it shitty  Can I get an Xbox 360  Shitty no  Shit  Sit down  Let me talk  Let me say something to you  I'm tired with this shitty attitude  So is that good or bad

Yeah, I was convinced that something was gonna happen, yeah, nothing, besides Bruce Jenner 
[03:23:30]  looking like Frankenstein on the ice, Lily, I'm skating, Lily, Grandpa, do you have a  skating spell I could use, Eddie, Eddie, hold your father's hand, Eddie, he looked like  fucking Frankenstein monster, it was just horrendous and the crowd clapping, it was just awful,  awful, awful, absolutely nothing to see there, oof, kind of, I was bummed, because they're 
[03:24:00]  making it sound like it was the, it was the show to see, oh, we got the little, um, the  little cowboy, we got the audio of the little kid, oh, you got the little cowboy, 18, never  left his house, this is his first, uh, public appearance, a house next door to me, what,  no, no, Elton John, here we go, fucking kid, what's your name, Garrett Johnson, and what  are you gonna sing?

[03:25:00]  could tell he's so nervous that you can't really get a good line on the voice, he cracked  a little bit, dude, you don't know if that's range problem or just pure nerves, God bless  him, man, that dude, if he gets four inches of confidence, if he gets off of that compound  that he lives on, yeah, yeah, he, he's just an inch of confidence, that motherfucker, he's 
[03:25:30]  autistic, that's some artistic shit that we just, and that's the only way his family's  nervous, his family's a cowboy, and they probably call him an asshole for singing, and they,  you hear stupid, whatever, singing in turn, and the mother's like, leave him alone, he's  a good singer, take him on down to that American eye, this mother, if he just confidence, man,  that dude, this kid can sing, to me.  Well, this is what the judge has had to say.  Alright, so what do you think, Simon?  Well, you know, there is a good voice in there somewhere, Randy, what do you think? 
[03:26:00]  You would really benefit from some really good lessons, I'm telling you.  I know, I need to sing for people.  Do you have enough money to pay for vocal lessons?  Oh, probably not.  Would someone help you?  Oh, I don't know, I don't have much.  Because without that, I think you'd have a problem.  Do you sing in the choir, church at all, or anything?  This is the first time I've ever been out in public, really.  Wow. 
[03:26:30]  Good for you.  You did a good job, dude, you did a good job.  Paula, yes or no?  Not ready for the competition, but I'm really proud of you for this audition, so we have to say no.  Okay, thank you.  Good job.  I am going to say yes.  Have you ever been on a plane before?  No.  I've always wanted to be on a plane.  It's kind of a silly dream, but I always wanted to be on a plane.  Just a goofy kid. 
[03:27:00]  Yeah.  Okay, moment of truth, you ready?  Dude, because I like you, yes!  Thank you.  Welcome to Hollywood!  Welcome to Hollywood!  Seriously, get some lessons.  Okay, thank you.  I will.  I will get some lessons.  In a town of four people?  Paula was the bad guy.  Yeah, amazing.  Because she thought, she thought...  Everyone else is just going to...  She absolutely just said yes, no, because she thought Simon was going to definitely say no.  Yeah.  But that kid can sing.  You just couldn't really get a feel for that because he was so nervous. 
[03:27:30]  And can you imagine the voice because he's like, he's like, he's like, you feel...  He sounds like he's from the 50s or something.  He's a prodigy.  When you watch those movies where they go back in time, that's how they always have him talk.  We'll see you next time.  When next time he's got to perform, if he's been able to calm down, if they train him a little bit.  He's so out.  Tim and Eerie.  He's out next round?  Yeah.  Hey guys, how you doing?  Good morning.  It made for a good story.  And they'll ride out the story and then it'll be over.  Tim, what's up? 
[03:28:00]  Hey guys, good morning to you.  Hey, Tim.  Hey, I got to tell you, I'm calling to plead with you.  You've got to get Drew Boogie to do a remix with Patrice singing It's Rain and Stuff.  That was the funniest thing I've heard all week.  You know what the most awful part of this whole thing is?  I'm going to be driving home today singing It's Rain and Stuff the whole way home.  Motherfucker.  It just stuck in my head.  I'm going to spin the XM dial to actually find the song so I can do my own version of writing.  Anything where there's a woman, something where man and this and you have to, you have 
[03:28:30]  to change the word man and fag.  That's why that sissy man is just like, how free is that?  Just to be, you know, I'm the queen of the night.  Oh, take it in the ass.  Give it to me, baby.  It's just like, oh shit.  What came out first?  My girl or my guy?  Which one was it first?  Oh God, I don't know.  Earl would know.  I see Earl in there.  Hey Earl, what was first?  My girl or my guy?  It has to be my girl because we didn't accept the faggots until recently. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, nothing you can say can take me away from...  Girl was first.  Earl says girl.  From my girl.  And then they had to change it to my guy.  My guy.  You know, but yeah, you always got to change the words around.  You can't just sing it verbatim if it's a chick song.  You can't.  You can't.  Nicole.  Unless you're a faggot.  Unless you're a faggot.  Hey, Nicole.  Hi.  How are you?  Good, Nicole.  What's up?  I just wanted to say that you guys are getting me in trouble at work right now.  Uh-oh.  Why?  And especially Patrice. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, he'll do that.  I am laughing so loud.  You're an African princess too, I can tell.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I am.  Nubian goddess.  And I can tell you're like kind of Halle Berry black.  Um, no.  No.  I'm like a little darker than Patrice.  Oh, she's like the color I am.  Delicious.  Yeah.  Patrice is pretty dark.  Oh, punk.  He's not.  No, see, sweetie, don't explain it to him.  That's white people eyes.  Fucking.  They always go, oh, that old chocolate motherfucker. 
[03:30:00]  We both know the deal.  There was a great example of some black racism.  Black guys being completely racist in the worst of situations.  There was a story I read in the paper this morning.  There was a beating death of a Chinese food delivery guy.  And the sentences are being handed down.  I guess the trial's going on.  Three guys.  Apparently they just killed him because one guy wanted to be in this gang.  And they had Chinese food coming over.  And one of the guys said, hey, you want to be in this gang? 
[03:30:30]  Kill this Chinese food delivery guy.  Poor guy coming to deliver food.  And they hit him with a claw hammer on the head with the claw side and just killed him like that.  So they ask him, had he ever delivered Chinese food to your house before?  And this motherfucker is up on a murder rap.  Doesn't know anything about sympathy or anything.  Says, well, I don't want to sound racist, but all them motherfuckers look alike to me.  Like, maybe that ain't the time to point that out in court on a murder rap for claw hammering this poor guy's head. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, baby, don't ever make no excuses to white people about it.  We know, we know.  It's like Holly Berry.  No, a little dog in a bit.  Well, Patrice is a big old black motherfucker.  No, I'm not.  I'm what they call brown skin in the black community.  No, Patrice, you're sexy.  I think you're a very sexy guy.  And I will be seeing you at Helium.  Yeah, Helium in Philly next Thursday, I think.  A week from tonight?  I have my tickets already.  Nice.  I need some tickets, by the way. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  All right.  We just pleasantly surprised.  All right, Nicole.  Philly's right there with us.  Thanks, Philly.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  That show's going to sell out.  Don't get fired.  Patrice at Helium in Philly.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jason in Arizona.  Jason.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey.  Yeah, I learned today that Patrice has the personality of a bitch.  He's a chip bull.  Yes, he just attacks.  That was wonderful.  Absolutely.  Yeah, you guys got to keep him, man.  If Jimmy gets too fancy and doesn't come back, man, you guys got to put him in that third 
[03:32:00]  seat.  Well, Jimmy's going to come back for good, like, a week from this coming Monday.  These guys have been so good for us, we're going to find a place for him, without a doubt.  We're going to ship Jimmy off on Little Night.  Jimmy, we got this great idea.  We want you to go to the biggest ball of twine in Oklahoma and call us from it.  And while you're away, Patrice and Bill Burr are going to be here.  Don't feel bad.  It's an important mission.  We're going to love this program. 
[03:32:30]  What?  The Ozone Midget Sighting of the Day.  Wow.  Who saw this coming?  Andrew, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Happy MLK Day, Patrice.  Where did you see your midgets, sir?  I got out of the subway today down by Manhattan and handed out those free newspapers.  It's a Lil' Black Midget.  Wow.  Really?  What was the newspaper?  That AM New York crap.  Oh, the free newspaper they tried?  Yeah.  Yeah, I didn't want to take one from his rich boss fingers, though.  Was he able to hold more than, like, one at a time with those little Vienna sausage fingers? 
[03:33:00]  He had a little step next to him because he didn't want to hold the whole thing at once.  I don't know if he could get his whole hand around it, you know, palm the whole thing.  Extra, extra, read all about it.  Little freak.  All right, guys.  Keep up the great work.  All right.  Thank you.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  Sure are.  They sure are weeding them out, those midgets.  You've never heard of the midget sighting of the day?  I guess it is a good bit.  We've been on the fence with the midgets.  We're so jaded.  When people see a midget, they've got to call because it's rare these days. 
[03:33:30]  When you give a girl a sonogram and you see a midget, a vacuum's got to come out.  Like, years ago, they didn't have that stuff.  You couldn't look through that, like, x-ray vision.  Let's say hi to Mike on Long Island.  Mike?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey, Mike.  I just wanted to, real quick, just play what I learned today.  Yes.  I learned today that my new favorite song is It's Raining Stuff.  It's Raining Stuff.  I like the Clean Hand song, the country song.  Clean Hand song.  Oh, yeah, the vulva song.  Clean Hand. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  I like that whole country beat you guys did.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey.  I wanted to call and tell you guys that I learned that if I walk in the bathroom and see a chick  with small tits, I'm in the right room.  There you go.  All right, guys.  Jerry in Philly, what did you learn on the O.P. and Anthony show?  Hey, boys, don't worry.  I learned it's okay to call a black girl a cunt, but not a bitch.  There you go.  Oh, very good.  We learned that today.  Mike in Baltimore.  Hey, guys.  Love the show.  Patricia is the funniest motherfucker on earth.  I swear to God.  I learned today that there's a third category of sissy. 
[03:34:30]  Category three sissy.  Great show today, guys.  Great show.  Yeah, we had fun today.  Thank you.  Let's go to Steven in California.  Steven.  Hey, I learned that Patrice should stay on this show because that web junk is fucked.  Oh, shit.  Well, a new web junk, you just taped it.  It'll be on this weekend.  Yeah, I'm trying to fucking figure it all out.  I like the web junk.  I really do.  What are you going to do?  Look for Patrice on VH1.  He's doing web junk 20 every week.  That's corporate selling off. 
[03:35:00]  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob bought in.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Yeah, I learned that a life lesson and a wrinkle come at an expensive price.  Punching it out.  I had no idea what he was discussing.  Let me.  All right, John, to you.  I learned that I'm a country singer, you idiot.  See you tomorrow, Victor.  Dear.  Dear. 
[03:35:30]  I'm out of here. </pre>
