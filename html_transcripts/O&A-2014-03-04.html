<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts alongside Mars and Eric.  The trio discussed the Oscars, criticizing the prevalent negativity on Twitter, highlighting Donald Trump's tweets and Bobo's surprisingly large (possibly bought) following.  They reviewed the previous day's guests: Brian Greene (physicist), Cesar Millan (Dog Whisperer – whose interview included a candid discussion of a past suicide attempt), and Jim Ross (WWE).  Other pre-show topics included Rob Ford's hilarious appearance on Jimmy Kimmel, Arby's purchase of Pharrell's hat, listener calls (some attempting to trick the hosts), Jim's anecdotes (including spilling coffee and dropping a microphone), Scarlett Johansson's pregnancy rumors, and a complicated explanation from Brian Greene about space-time. The pre-show concluded with humorous commentary on the smell of comedy club microphones.

The main show heavily featured a discussion about the radio personalities Scott Shannon and Todd's professional split, with the hosts initially intending to criticize Scott but changing their minds after a 15-minute phone call.  Naomi DiClemente called in to offer commentary.  Scott Shannon's song choice ("Backstabber") was analyzed, and his lucrative past contracts and planned move to CBS FM were discussed.  The show also highlighted Rob Ford's comedic Jimmy Kimmel interview, the success of "Frozen," a caller's story about a woman tied to a tree, and a debate on the role of the director versus special effects in "Gravity."  The segment included clips of Keith Gerke, a fake chef who pranked local news stations with absurd leftover recipes, promoting the Found Footage Festival.

Further segments included more absurd media clips:  Chef Keith's bizarre leftover recipe demonstrations (including tipping over the table), a failing yo-yo master named K-Stross, and audio of Fez (from the Ron and Fez Show) having a meltdown after being told to avoid a guest (possibly Seth MacFarlane), using the phrase "cake horn" which trended on Twitter.  Fez's past eccentricities and perceived lack of respect from management were also discussed.  The hosts also discussed a conflict within KISS, specifically Paul Stanley's criticism of Ace Frehley and the band's decision to remove their makeup.  Personal anecdotes, including a story about a mistaken boarding pass and a drunken passenger vomiting in one host's car, were shared.

The show continued with discussion of Kiss, including personal anecdotes and the band's internal conflicts.  St. Patrick's Day broadcast plans were made, including playing Irish music, live segments from the parade, and calls from Irish pubs.  A debate on the superiority of vinyl records over digital music ensued, with strong opinions expressed by both hosts and callers.  The Oscar Pistorius trial was discussed, along with the hosts’ own experiences with intense anger and impulses toward violence.

A segment featured advertisements for WrestleMania, Adam Carolla's *Catch a Contractor*, and the Opie and Anthony 20th-anniversary radio jam, followed by humorous commentary on the "Two Girls, One Cup" video.  An interview with Chef Keith detailed his viral pranks, including his methods and on-air antics.  A phone slam with Club Soda Kenny and a contentious exchange with a seemingly intoxicated and late Jimmy followed.  The hosts ate sandwiches on air, celebrated Eric's birthday (possibly on a Sunday or Fat Tuesday), and engaged in playful banter and sexually suggestive jokes. Eric’s weight loss journey was discussed, along with frequent mentions of celebratory meals and a near weigh-in.  More discussion of Chef Keith's pranks and the Found Footage Festival concluded this segment.

The show continued with discussion of Roland's weight loss journey (or lack thereof), focusing on his consumption of a Leone's Heroes sandwich and cake.  The grossness of cleaning a baby's genitals was discussed. A call-in segment awarded WWE tickets to a listener.  The show concluded with advertisements and a post-show segment with Sam Roberts, Nicole from the morning mashup, a “Line of the Day” segment, and further discussion of Chef Keith’s pranks.  Numerous advertisements were interspersed throughout the broadcast.

[00:00:30]  Only a show this big could have a pre-show this good.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show with Sam Roberts.  Welcome.  Welcome, welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  So, Tuesday, minutes before the Opie and Anthony show begins, we are counting down here on the Opie and Anthony channel. 
[00:01:00]  Live, 866-WOW1-WOW is the phone number.  866-969-1969.  Call up now and be a part of the Opie and Anthony pre-show as only you can.  Big, big show planned for today.  Big show yesterday.  As always, we'll be talking about everything that went down yesterday.  And some of what we might be able to expect to see today. 
[00:01:30]  So, call in if you want to talk about it.  866-WOW1-WOW.  And start your mornings here.  Mars is in the studio right now getting everything ready.  It should be a fun show.  Yesterday was a fun show coming off a big live tweeting day.  It was an Oscar day.  Apparently now, and I'm sure we'll talk about it, but it was one of the most viewed Oscars in a long time.  Which is weird.  It seems like as TV is getting watched less. 
[00:02:00]  Because there's more, you know, YouTube and everything else entertainment-wise.  These live events, like the Super Bowl and the Oscars and shows like that, are getting watched more and more.  Because this was one of the most watched Oscar ceremonies in years.  And it was boring and predictable.  I think it's the live tweeting.  Everybody's so into live tweeting now that everybody has to be watching it.  We talked about live tweeting.  We got into it a little bit yesterday.  Let's start today's pre-show, E-Rock, with track two. 
[00:02:30]  She had a couple good laughs off the pizza thing, though.  Asking Harvey Weinstein for money.  Right.  Telling the girl her stock just went up.  Come on, get out some money.  She had some decent laughs trying to get money from people.  Yeah.  She did okay.  I mean, you know.  She said the beginning was good.  This is why it's so stupid to live tweet these things.  And then you come in to do...  This is way more important than live tweeting.  You know what I mean?  There's like 10% of your followers actually see your tweets at night. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  If that.  No, it's kind of fun, though.  It is kind of fun.  I like reading them.  It's kind of fun to be a dick.  But then you realize everyone out there is just trying to be a dick.  Just trying to be a dick.  Everyone is just trying to be a dick now.  That's the whole thing with live tweeting events.  Is to be a complete fucking asshole.  But you try for the laugh.  Oh, yeah.  But I mean, you know, okay.  Here comes Travolta.  All right.  Oh, boy.  Travolta wig, wig joke, something.  Something's on his head. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  What is that?  He likes men.  What is that?  It was so funny that they were bringing all that up yesterday because it's true.  They would never, and I don't think any of us would ever sit there and prep for the radio  show by taking notes while the Oscars was on, you know?  And that's what I guess you should be doing, right?  If you have a radio show and you're sitting there taking notes on what your observations are  so you have a little refresher the next morning and you can really get into it, you can really  wait until the next morning to sink your teeth into whatever the live community event was 
[00:04:00]  that was on TV.  But they get all their shit out live tweeting.  So they're tweeting the whole thing and then they get to work the next day and it goes,  yeah, I mean, it was okay.  Yeah, it was fine.  Ignoring all the jokes they had while the whole thing was going.  But they were right in their assessment that the whole tweeting thing, nice tweets never stick.  Like there are those people, we read some tweets from Jenny Hut, I think Nicole from the morning mashup 
[00:04:30]  was doing it, there are those people that when they're live tweeting something, they're tweeting  about how much they appreciate something or they're tweeting about how much they like something.  Or they're sucking up.  Or they're sucking up.  That's exactly right.  Iraq just yelled at their sucking up.  That's what I think Jenny Hut was doing.  Yeah, because she wants a spot in the industry and she thinks that, oh, well, at least she  hasn't insulted us.  That never works.  Nice guys finished last, Jenny Hut.  That's something Donald Trump knows very well. 
[00:05:00]  I feel like as much of an idiot as Donald Trump is, he was making my Oscar watching experience  all the better.  We talked about him a little bit on ONA yesterday.  We were reading his tweets because basically he was just running down the show.  And saying how much everything sucked.  The key to Donald Trump's tweets.  And I was reading all his tweets.  I didn't even pick up on this while the Oscars was on.  I didn't pick up on this until the next day when we talked about it yesterday. 
[00:05:30]  And I don't think any of us on the show did, was one of the people that Donald Trump retweeted  while he was retweeting all the compliments about him.  That's all he was doing.  He was just taking shots at how bad the Oscars was and then retweeting how great he was.  But listen to the caliber of people that were tweeting how good the Donald was.  Someone's saying that Donald Trump actually retweeted Bobo last night.  There's no way that happened.  Oh, God.  Well, there might because... 
[00:06:00]  Hold on.  Ryan, there's no way that happened.  It is.  Look at it.  When he started praising everyone when the show was over, he took the second tweet on it.  Like, there's some other person than Bobo.  Wait, Sam just found it.  Wait, where is it?  He retweeted Bobo's retweet.  Bobo tweeted...  Goes.  He just started goes to Donald Trump best tweets of the night.  Oscars.  And it's Bobo.  He did retweet Bobo.  But, I mean, I'm not surprised. 
[00:06:30]  He's killing it with the followers, man.  Bobo's up to 132,000 followers.  What the fuck?  It's all fake.  I think somebody's spying Bobo a lot of followers.  Bobo's got fake followers.  The goal is to have Bobo have more followers than us.  Yeah.  And then that son of a bitch will really believe that.  I don't know.  Bobo is becoming a Twitter celebrity.  Of course, you know Bobo from the show.  He's becoming this massive Twitter celebrity where he has people like Donald Trump retweeting him.  But he's got something like 130,000 followers. 
[00:07:00]  None of us know how it happened.  Obviously, somebody is purchasing followers for our pal Bobo.  But none of us know who it is.  None of us know why it is.  None of us know how much they're paying.  Because nobody's bought followers before around this show that I know of.  At least nobody will admit it.  I'd love to do an investigation to find out if anybody has.  But looking at our numbers, I think it's pretty obvious.  Our numbers are all pretty, you know, where they should be.  Nobody's bought followers before.  So we don't know what the process is. 
[00:07:30]  But somebody is creating an internet celebrity out of Bobo.  And I couldn't appreciate it more.  You know, we had that caller call in and inform us that Donald Trump had retweeted Bobo.  By the way, if you want to call the pre-show, 866-WOW1-WOW, 866-969-1969.  That caller called up and informed us that Donald Trump had retweeted Bobo.  That's a good caller.  Of course, we have our share of bad callers, too. 
[00:08:00]  It happened yesterday.  I can't believe this keeps happening.  I cannot believe that people are still falling for it.  But it just makes me happy every time.  Let's go to track 10, Eric.  Just slow down.  I think you're talking and your phone is dropping out.  Yes.  Okay, Jimmy.  Jimmy, right.  Thank you.  I'll slow it down.  Yes.  Yes.  Sorry about that.  I don't want to make it.  No problem.  Go ahead.  Looking like he's never seen you.  We heard you! 
[00:08:30]  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  Don't say, no, you didn't.  No one would gladly fall for that.  You didn't know.  No, you don't graciously bow out and be like, by the way, I'm still here.  I'm still here.  He did.  That guy, he acts like he's going to hang up the phone.  Oh, I'm sure you guys heard me.  Oh, wait.  I'm still here.  And he picks him back up and he falls for it again.  Yes.  If you call in the Opie and Anthony show and your joke may not be that great, there is 
[00:09:00]  a huge chance that if we're asking you to repeat it or if they are asking you to repeat  it, it's been hurt.  I'm sure people are still going to fall for it.  A lot of stuff going on today.  Yesterday, we had good guests.  Brian Green was in, physicist, and Cesar Millan.  The Dog Whisperer.  There's stuff to get into today.  Rob Ford, speaking of guests, is not going to be on the Opie and Anthony show, but he 
[00:09:30]  was on Jimmy Kimmel last night.  I wish he was going to be on the Opie and Anthony show.  And Jimmy Kimmel, god damn did he do his job well.  As a matter of fact, Lou in Jersey, we were just talking about Rob Ford on Jimmy Kimmel.  Yes, the politician that keeps on giving.  The what?  I tell you, the politician that keeps on giving.  That man delivers more one-liners.  Yeah, and I couldn't believe it.  Jimmy Kimmel started his interview last night.  No one will get into the whole thing with, why are you here?  He is such a camera whore that he just lines up and will do anything. 
[00:10:00]  I mean, Jimmy Kimmel, my favorite part about Rob Ford on Jimmy Kimmel last night was Jimmy  Kimmel stood Rob Ford in front of a video screen and just watched all of Rob Ford's videos  with him and asked for commentary on exactly why and what was going on.  And it was absolutely classic.  And I'll tell you, there ain't too many politicians in America that get the applause.  I mean, I know it's a circus act, but you know what? 
[00:10:30]  I think that Opie and Anthony would take Rob Ford over de Blasio.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, Rob Ford, I think all of us wish that Rob Ford was mayor of New York.  You know how much fun that would be?  Oh, it would be all right.  It would be unbelievable.  Thank you, Lou.  Thanks, man.  Lou would probably take Rob Ford over Chris Christie, for God's sakes.  But, of course, yeah, we'll talk about Jimmy Kimmel on Rob Ford.  Jimmy Kimmel.  That's what it should be.  It should be Rob Ford's show with Jimmy Kimmel as a guest.  We made TMZ again yesterday. 
[00:11:00]  Jim Ross.  We were talking about JR yesterday's pre-show.  JR from the WWE was in on Friday.  He told a story of Vince McMahon sharding, and it made TMZ.  So congratulations to the Opie and Anthony show once again on TMZ.  And tons of news stories.  Arby's, Arby's, Arby's just keeps attaching themselves to that Pharrell hat.  Arby's bought the Pharrell hat.  Pharrell, did you hear about that?  No.  Pharrell auctioned his Arby's hat. 
[00:11:30]  And Arby's is the one that bought it.  I don't know where they're going to put it.  I don't know if there's some kind of center store for them to display it.  But it belongs in a Hall of Fame somewhere.  Hard Rock Johnny was probably pissed that he didn't get his hands on it.  But Arby's has it now.  We heard Jim yell his patented, we heard you, at a caller yesterday.  Jim had some awesome stories yesterday.  First of all, I love the Jim embarrasses himself.  We started yesterday's show. 
[00:12:00]  And we mentioned it at the end of the pre-show.  I wish that we had been on the air for it.  But Jim spilled an entire cup of coffee all over himself and his papers and his desk, everything.  It was filled to the tippy-tippy top.  And clumsy Jim just knocked it over.  Apparently, he's been on a roll as far as knocking things over.  A caller called in and informed us.  This is like the revenge of the callers.  He's like, no, there's going to be no we heard you from me.  I'm going to tell everybody that you did a silly thing while you were performing over the weekend. 
[00:12:30]  Let's go to track six.  Hey, Jimmy, I saw you on Friday.  It was fantastic.  Thank you.  And I'm glad to see that you're going the way of Michael J. Fox because you're a great performer,  but yet you can't control your extremities, apparently.  What do you mean?  Well, let's see.  You just spilled coffee this morning in the studio.  And on Friday, you dropped the mic in the middle of a child no-station joke.  It was a mic with a cord, and I was standing on it, and I didn't realize it.  I went to move my arm, and the mic fell out of my hand. 
[00:13:00]  Like a claw.  Oh, shit, that's funny.  Yeah, I couldn't have done a more rank amateur move.  Did the audience notice?  Boy, it was a dull thud in front of a thousand people.  That's the best part of seeing comedy.  You never know when somebody's going to completely humiliate themselves.  Now, Jim is a professional, so I'm sure he picked things up and went right along, but  still, that moment is priceless.  Priceless.  Always go see Jim live because you never know when he's going to drop something.  The other Jim story, that was just funny. 
[00:13:30]  The Jim story that I thought was really interesting were, of course, of course, we were talking  about threesomes on the show.  And whenever anything sexual comes up, Jim has some story that defies what everybody else  is talking about.  And we all go, what?  Like, how did we never hear this before?  We were talking about threesomes.  Let's go to track nine.  Yeah, I've had a couple with people like with fans.  So they don't really know you? 
[00:14:00]  No.  No, I'm just watching like a porno movie.  I've had a couple with fans, but the last time I did that, it was like a couple times  with the same couple.  I think we were off the airy, but that's how long ago that was.  And the girl convinced me to shave my pubes because they were all straight and Asian  looking.  She's like, you ought to shave them.  And then from then on, I shave my pubic hair.  Straight and Asian looking, huh?  But I was hitting on this girl after a gig and she was leading me on like, yeah, yeah,  yeah.  And I was getting real vibes off her. 
[00:14:30]  She's like, well, I'm in the hotel with my boyfriend.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  I kept trying to get her back to my room.  And she convinced me like, well, you can watch us.  And I was like, I guess that was my only options.  And I watched, but then she fucking sat on my dick and rode my dick.  No bag, no nothing.  And he just watched because he was drunk.  Oh, my God.  And he was all right with that?  Yeah, he was cool with it.  It was hot.  The fuck is going on?  So weird.  Yeah.  That is so odd.  I would want to talk to Jim about that scenario all day.  That's one of those scenarios that like nothing even close to that has been in my life. 
[00:15:00]  And I feel like Jim just has story after story with these things.  He's written two books.  He's on the radio every day.  And that still has managed to never get out.  I don't understand it.  Let's go to Dave in California.  Dave, welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  Hey, what's up, Brock?  How are you doing?  Hey, I just wanted to say, man, the Cesar Millan interview was awesome.  It was so unexpected.  I was just like, oh, the dog whisper or whatever.  But that, the Ted Lange, and then there was one other one this week that was just so 
[00:15:30]  unexpectedly good.  And even Jim Rock.  I mean, yeah, he was long-winded.  And, you know, you guys couldn't cut him off.  But it was great.  Yeah, we've been on a roll.  Thank you, Dave, for calling in the middle of the night.  We've been on a roll of having low expectations for guests.  And I think that's just because the show is so pessimistic.  But having low expectations for guests and then having these guests come in and blow it out of the water.  However, Cesar Millan, ONA boy, this was another one, especially Opie, before he came in, was like, 
[00:16:00]  why are we having the dog whisperer on?  I don't know how this is going to go.  I don't have good expectations for this.  And then immediately, he's super honest.  He just comes in, and he's honest, and he's fascinating, and he's got everything going on.  Let's play track 14.  This is when Cesar first came in, right?  And you think, you know, Cesar Millan has gone through a divorce.  He attempted suicide, and there's stuff that you would assume he's not going to want to talk about. 
[00:16:30]  Like, you think he's just going to want to go on and talk about poodles.  But Cesar Millan has no problem.  What are you doing?  Eric, you have terrible on the board this morning.  No, no, there's a problem here.  I'm switching the files.  Eric keeps hitting buttons.  Anyway, Cesar Millan, he was talking about a suicide attempt.  Let's go to track 14. 
[00:17:00]  And you really attempted suicide?  Is that true?  Yes, I did.  How?  Yes, I did.  Well, I took all the pills that I could find around.  Wow, you were serious, because we talk about it on the show.  No, no, no.  We don't think the...  Well, maybe I shouldn't say this.  When people slit their wrists, we don't think they're as serious as going all in with pills.  No, I didn't think...  Oh, man.  No, I did it.  I just took all of them.  Everything you could find in the house.  Everything I could find in the house.  And how were you saved?  Well, the only thing I can tell you, you know, is I wasn't meant to die. 
[00:17:30]  Wow.  The doctor said you could kill five people with this.  Wow.  You know, you were now meant to die.  Who found you, or did you realize it?  My kids, my kids, my kids.  Yes, it's a shocking thing, but...  We've all thought of it at times.  Absolutely.  Right before you were doing it, what were you thinking?  Like, oh, no, they're going to find me?  Or did you kind of block out all rational stuff?  I don't think at that time you think about anybody else.  You know, I don't think that...  In my case, I'm telling you my experience, my feeling at that moment is I wasn't wanted,  I wasn't needed.  And to me, it's all about the pack. 
[00:18:00]  So when the pack rejects you, you pretty much don't have anything.  Even though there is some, you know, success, material success.  But to me, it was the pack.  And so the pack said, we no longer need you.  Oh, wow.  So it's like high school, you know, when kids are mean to other kids, and there's a lot of  suicide in the high school world because kids isolate kids.  Sure.  You know, so that's the feeling of not feel needed, wanted, or loved.  Can I...  I got it.  I'm sorry.  And we can move on to other stuff, certainly. 
[00:18:30]  But when you realized you were alive, were you mad at that point?  Or were you relieved?  Like, oh, my God, I so didn't want to do that.  I woke up in a psychiatric holdup for 72 hours.  And at that time, I said, well, I didn't die.  Let's go.  It's time to move on.  Oh, good for you.  Yeah, so that's it.  You know, if I didn't die, that was for a reason.  I'm a very, you know, religious guy.  And so at that time, it was my wake-up call.  And then go back to what I know best. 
[00:19:00]  Surviving a suicide attempt has got to be so fucking embarrassing.  Like, having to come back from that and be like, yeah, that's probably being a little overdramatic.  Yeah, I guess I didn't have to go that far.  I'm sorry.  Can I just continue living now?  And then you have to go and talk to people about it.  But Cesar Millan was very forthright about it.  I was impressed.  And that was early in the interview.  It's not like we had established any sort of comfort or anything with him.  I had to yell at Eric before.  He's got a little nervous fingers on the board today.  All you have to do is be better than Sal. 
[00:19:30]  You don't have to be great.  You just have to be better than Sal.  So no pressure.  Don't even worry about it.  We also talked to Cesar about dogs, of course, and house training dogs.  This is a funny clip.  Let's go to track 15.  What about a housebreaking dog like that?  Some people have difficulty doing that.  Housebreaking means structure, means discipline.  So when a dog is not doing the whole housebreaking thing, it's because the human is not consistent with the rules.  Feeding should be a rule.  After the dog eats, five minutes to 30 minutes, that's when they have the bowel movement. 
[00:20:00]  So now that you know, that's the biological.  Right.  It is nothing outside of that.  But there are people that just dump a bunch of food and leave it there.  It's like a cat, right?  Right.  Or like a bird.  Free feeding doesn't allow you to have structure.  Right.  You know, so most of the time people don't know or they're lazy, you know?  Yeah.  And so they don't want to create a structure.  So in order for you to have a housebreaking, a perfect housebreaking behavior from a dog, you need two weeks of investment.  After that, the dog knows the routine because you're creating a pattern. 
[00:20:30]  Uh-huh.  So they'll know, like, all right, they're going to take me out so I can go.  Or they're going to tell me where to use the bathroom.  Right, right.  You know, some people use newspapers.  Some people use wig-wig pads.  Whatever it is, it's just you're just showing a pattern.  Remember, when you get a dog, he doesn't know where he lives.  So it's a moment of adjustment.  He gets nervous.  He gets fearful.  He gets unsure.  He's disoriented.  So when the brain is in that state, they're going to use the bathroom more often.  Right.  Because, you know, the nerves create easy bowel movement. 
[00:21:00]  That's what Jimmy did the first time he came out of my house.  That's right.  He's in the bathroom all the time.  I just ran in a circle and I made it on the kitchen floor.  Cesar Millan makes having dogs seem like so much work and pressure.  It's like kids.  It doesn't seem that tough.  Also, in the last clip we played, it was really weird when Cesar Millan started talking about, like,  it's all about the pack and running with the pack.  And I didn't think, dude, you're not a dog.  Like, enough about the dogs already.  But I will tell you, maybe it's because I have the mind of a child. 
[00:21:30]  But the only reason I wanted to play that clip was because all day yesterday,  I was laughing at Cesar Millan saying bowel movement in his accent.  Bowel movement.  Rock and rip in pencil.  Rock and rip.  What are we doing?  Wrestling names?  You're on the pre-show.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  Good morning.  Good morning.  I got two words for you, man.  Vaginal knitting.  Have we?  I think we've watched vaginal knitting before, right?  Oh, have you?  I think so.  Is it fake? 
[00:22:00]  I think it might be fake.  I don't know, man.  But it's one of the most WTF videos I've ever seen.  Keep rocking, Rip.  All right.  Thanks.  I'll talk to you later.  Nathan in Texas.  Welcome to the pre-show.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  I just wanted to say, I caught that clip with the physicist yesterday.  And I was, you know, I thought that the whole show, it's all laughing and jokes and bullshit.  But I was highly surprised about how in-depth they went with that physicist and just how great that whole part was. 
[00:22:30]  It really was.  And it's always good.  Thanks, Nathan.  It's always good when we get somebody like a physicist in here that can break it down the way Brian Green did.  Brian Green kind of simplified that.  I mean, a little bit.  I still got lost throughout most of the interview.  But, I mean, we were talking about tearing the fabric of space and time.  And to be able to translate that on a, you know, dick and fart joke radio show and have at least some of the audience figure out what you're talking about is quite a talent. 
[00:23:00]  And Brian Green, he did a great job of that.  Let's play track 11.  And when you talk about tearing the fabric of space-time, what does that mean?  Yeah.  So this is work that I was fortunate to be involved with a number of years ago where, you see, in Einstein's theory of general relativity, it's called, which is this theory of the force of gravity, Einstein taught us that space can curve.  It can warp. 
[00:23:30]  You can think of sort of space as almost like a rubber sheet, going back to that two-dimensional version that's not as satisfying, but let's just use it because we can wrap our minds around it.  So, you know, you imagine you have a big bowling ball and a rubber sheet.  It kind of curves the sheet.  Similarly, the sun curves the space around it.  But here's the thing.  In Einstein's approach, space can bend, it can warp, but it can't rip.  In Einstein's equations, if space were to rip, the equations break down, the universe grinds to a halt.  That's not something that we expect could happen. 
[00:24:00]  We reanalyzed that issue of the tearing of space in this more refined set of equations that come from string theory.  And we found that in this refined approach, space can tear.  It can rip apart and reconnect in a way that doesn't cause the universe to grind to a halt.  The math just smoothly sails through this tear in the fabric of space.  No catastrophe at all.  So it was a kind of surprising result.  Nobody anticipated that this would be the new repertoire of potential behaviors when you go beyond Einstein's approach. 
[00:24:30]  See, I think everybody here was like, yeah, okay, the sun, okay, I get it.  Shaping the, uh, bleh, bleh, bleh.  I lost you.  Like, everybody just kind of glazed over within 30 seconds of that.  But, it's like the most interesting stuff in the world.  It's what everything is made of.  I don't know what we'll get into today.  Okay, 866-WOW1-WOW if you want to call the pre-show.  We've got about six minutes left before the Opie and Anthony show begins.  Uh, Scarlett Johansson is apparently, all these articles are saying she's pregnant, uh, which is a shame. 
[00:25:00]  I'm sure we'll talk about it on today's show, but maybe for this week's podcast, we revisit the day of September 13th?  14th.  Was it 14th?  I think so.  No, we'll look it up.  Um, that'll be on the podcast, of course.  We'll be out tomorrow morning.  Uh, today, a lot to get into still.  And, you know, Larry, who's called this show many times, uh, has always preached the word of God.  He's the homophobic Sam Roberts superfan. 
[00:25:30]  Uh, I thought of him when Brian Green was on talking about God yesterday.  Because I think, I'm glad ONA brought this up.  Because that's what I think is one of the most interesting things.  To talk to these physicists who make it their life to figure out the world.  And how we're here, and why we're here, and what we're doing, and how it became, and blah, blah, blah.  Where they're at, in terms of God.  Uh, and we got into that, uh, with Brian Green.  Let's go to track 12.  Where you at with God, and, uh, other life out there. 
[00:26:00]  Well, you know, for God, my view is that there may well be a God.  Right, I have no evidence to convince me that there is.  All of my understanding of physics suggests that that's all that we need, and to understand at least the nature of the physical universe.  But that doesn't prove there isn't a God out there.  So, my view is, if what we are doing as physicists is, say, working out God's laws in some secret way, I'm thrilled to be part of that journey. 
[00:26:30]  That's a pretty deep thing to do, and if there is no God, as I suspect there isn't, and all we're doing is working out the laws of physics that brought the universe into existence, and governed its evolution, if that's what we're doing, I'm happy to be part of that journey.  So, from a day-to-day perspective, it doesn't really affect what I do.  He got more into it, uh, with evidence of God, uh, later on in the interview.  Let's play that, Trey.  I, I, I just kind of feel that, you know, that some, some hairy guy sitting up in space somewhere granting wishes doesn't make sense to me, but. 
[00:27:00]  Right.  If you can kind of grasp it through physics, that, that kind of makes a whole lot of sense to me.  Yeah, you know, I agree.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me either, but on the other hand, quantum mechanics didn't make a whole lot of sense to some of the greatest geniuses of the 20th century.  And it turned out to be right.  So, the, the thing is, the only ideas that I'm willing to buy into are ideas that have a strong mathematical basis, which ultimately are confirmed by experiment or observation. 
[00:27:30]  That's the gold standard.  And all these other things that we talk about with God, I don't even know how to, what it means in any, in any deep, rigorous sense.  I have an intuitive feel for what people mean, but, you know, it's hard to, to test that kind of an idea.  Right, there's no way to figure it out.  Yeah.  Now, on the other hand, if the, if the sky was to open, if the sky was to open and the, the big man up there said, I'm here, I am God.  I wonder, would I be convinced then?  Part of me says, well, I guess I would. 
[00:28:00]  Part of me feels like maybe I checked myself into Bellevue at that point.  Yeah.  So, I don't know what exactly I'm looking for when I say, where's the evidence, right?  And that's the debate.  I mean, and that's what the Bill Nye creationism debate that we were talking about a couple weeks ago boiled down to.  So, the whole thing ends up being, you know, the guys who study physics, they go, okay, well, how do we get there?  Those guys go, what's, how do we get here?  Those guys say it's a mystery. 
[00:28:30]  The guys who are religious, how do we get here?  Well, God put us here by magic and it's in a book, the Bible.  And it's like, there is no, there's no way you could prove one way or the other.  Real quick, it grossed me out so much.  But we were talking about Jim's stories before we run out of time and have to start the actual Opie and Anthony show, God forbid.  We were talking about, Jim was talking about being at comedy clubs and dirty mics.  It just grossed me out so much.  This is track three, Eric.  Can we spray this microphone?  Does your mic stink? 
[00:29:00]  Ew, it stinks.  It ain't for me.  I fucking said five words into it.  Before I talked, I said, I know what I said.  Oh, my God.  Didn't Mars used to spray these?  Mars?  He used to.  Comment.  Stop spraying these.  Kaiser Sosay.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Who was using that microphone?  Now I got the heebie-jeebies.  Why'd you use that one?  Because I supplied this to bed.  Oh, man.  Calm down.  Try that.  Stop your spilling it.  Now you got us all paranoid. 
[00:29:30]  By the way, I want to.  I want to get one of my own of these.  Oh, yeah.  My own fucking.  Spring it in every day.  Your little mic windscreen.  Yeah.  Disgusting.  Oh, that's better.  Somebody else's mouth right on it.  It is right on it all the time.  What a German fence infested.  It's a perfect little home for germs.  Comedy club mics.  I try never to smell.  You get one whiff of them, and it's just all dried spits.  It could ruin your day, right?  It takes the funny right out of the night.  I should say.  There's pieces of food in the mesh.  He's ready to vomit. 
[00:30:00]  It's fucking terrible, man.  It's so bad.  You ever see like a little piece of carrot or meat in the fucking mesh?  Oof.  I would think they would have came up with a better design for that.  Yeah, yeah.  It catches all little food particles.  You got to talk into it.  That is so disgusting.  Anyway, huge Ovi and Anthony show coming up today.  Of course, we made it to TMZ.  Jimmy Kimmel had Rob Ford on his show.  There's a fake chef that was going on local news shows, even though he didn't know how to cook. 
[00:30:30]  Too funny.  A news reporter getting smashed by snow.  I'm sure you've all seen the viral video.  Everything going on in the Ukraine.  Scarlett Johansson is pregnant, according to these articles.  Arby's bought that stupid hat.  And there's Kiss News.  So Jim's going to be happy.  Find out about all that and more.  When the Ovi and Anthony show begins, which happens right now. 
[00:31:00]  With all this stuff, I'm going to be happy.  And if.  I'm sure everyone knows.  Good-bye. 
[00:31:30]  Cause what happened right now.  I am the other.  Thank you. 
[00:32:00]  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  Two Long Island natives who together would one day change the world as broadcasting's greatest duo.  Oh my God, this is beautiful.  After 20 years, these children of the 80s have arrived.  Their hugely popular radio show is not just in New York anymore.  Opie and Anthony's show.  Opie and Anthony's show.  We're out of the show.  We're out of the show. 
[00:35:00]  Through 55-gallon drums and wiffle ball bats.  You push it in until you're comfortable.  From mayors to mayor.  It was an April Fool's hopes by two radio disc jockeys.  And wieners and pigs.  And wieners and pigs.  Opie and Anthony got their hands on the photo and tweeted it.  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any.  Well, these people will definitely stop.  Guaranteed.  Lift up the cocks.  They've met friends along the way. 
[00:35:30]  Jim Norton.  I have a raging heart on right now.  Can I please put my dick in your donuts?  And through fines, scandals, suspensions, cancellations, and terminations,  it's the one show that remains unscathed.  Striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere  comes a radio show that after 20 years remains above all else.  Real. 
[00:36:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, low volume, right?  What's wrong?  I feel okay.  What's wrong?  I'm pranked all the way up and it sounds like shit.  Oh, really?  Let's get on this, Mars.  Let's go.  Chop, chop.  Eight to quarter.  You've got bad volume in your headphones. 
[00:36:30]  What if I do this?  It's odd.  Don't do that.  Well, that should be way over there.  Why?  Why?  I don't know.  Oh, now I've got to crank it all the way.  What happens?  I don't know.  I don't know what happens.  It's very odd, though.  Eh, what are you going to do?  That's better.  It's not our problem.  We'll just continue to rot.  We'll just sit here and rot. 
[00:37:00]  Good morning, everyone.  Hi, people.  How are the people?  Oh, Jesus.  People?  You've got to call some people?  I would love to talk about the weather, but everyone else is talking about the weather.  Is that what's going on?  How much it sucks.  Fucking ridiculous.  At least it's a little lighter out when I come in.  Yeah, that's kind of cool.  Got that sun coming up over the horizon a little bit.  That's just...  Lighting up that sky a bit, saying, hello, the sun's coming. 
[00:37:30]  It's supposed to be, what, 45, I guess?  Today?  No, the average is what it's supposed to be now.  Oh, really?  This time of year.  Oh.  It was 11 degrees when I left my house.  Oh, my gosh.  11?  11.  Was it really?  Oh, it's just...  I hate it.  Yeah, but you're only...  Don't you open up your pool April 1st?  That's like my goal every year, is to open it April 1st.  It's not 11.  It was 11 degrees.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:38:00]  Climbing.  That's different.  Yeah, it's just fucking brutal.  Eh, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  I went to bed last night like a big boy.  I got done, did a Comedy Cellar set, was home by 9.40 and in bed.  Nice.  And look at the clock.  It was 11.18.  Uh-oh.  As I lay there wide awake.  No.  I was exhausted.  But I just lay there like a nervous animal.  Are you drinking coffee late?  Not at all, dude.  I fucking don't drink coffee after I leave here. 
[00:38:30]  I'm done with coffee by 9.30 in the morning.  Because that was my thing.  No.  Rest with your thoughts.  Is it trying to rest with your mind racing all the time?  It's that or I put the apnea mask on, I'm finally getting relaxed and I feel like a  little nose hair going, hee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.  That can't be good.  Torture.  That can't be relaxing.  It's torture.  Hee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee.  I even put my phone in the other room.  I left my phone in the living room.  I plugged it in.  I'm like, no phone stuff.  Like, you know, I'm not going to look at my computer when I get back.  Yeah.  Get everything right.  Aw. 
[00:39:00]  And it didn't work.  Why would it?  Jeez, man.  That would be a nightmare.  It stinks.  My bad sleep was all about coffee and eating too late and I figured all that out.  Maybe 80 to 8.  You know what?  That could be it.  I ate right before I came back.  I ate like a little.  The eating will just fire up that system, man, because now your whole body has to do something  with that food.  Working.  Yeah, maybe.  Yeah, it's breaking it down and pushing this over here.  Let me push some of this over here.  Right.  Here, let's push the waist down.  Yeah.  We're working. 
[00:39:30]  Muscles are working in there.  Muscles are working.  Oh, you're pumping acids.  Yeah, you're firing up that metabolism.  That can't be good.  No.  Little Beavis drops his cat toys on my face at night.  Yeah.  He wants to play.  That's what you call his balls?  Yeah.  His little cat toys.  Really?  With a long gun.  Yeah, he wants to play fetch in the middle of the night.  How about you lock him out of your bedroom, man?  No, he's a good guy.  He just hangs out.  He might get a little rambunctious, but.  But he wakes you up for putting stuff on your face. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  He picks up his little cat toys and then drops them directly on my face.  Nice.  It's adorable.  He's trying to wake you up.  It's noon.  He's basically saying, enough already.  Enough.  Get up.  Get the fuck up and feed me.  He's got a headache again.  Boy, Dad-Dad gets tired a lot, doesn't he?  Dad-Dad.  Jesus.  LeBron scored 61 last night.  I know we're not big NBA guys here, but LeBron. 
[00:40:30]  That's a record, I guess, for him?  It's, yeah.  Season record.  Well, I guess his all-time record.  Not bad.  He's wearing his little fucking mask there.  His scary mask.  Yeah, he broke his nose.  What happened?  They told him to not wear the black one?  Did they really?  Yeah, I guess the NBA kind of requested.  It wasn't like an order, but they're like, hey, because it was like intimidating or something.  What the fuck?  They had a costume almost if you were black.  It's like a Lone Ranger thing.  Was it scaring the gay one?  I don't know. 
[00:41:00]  It was scaring the gay guy.  Who cares if that guy's gay?  Oh, so he had to go with the clear mask.  Yeah.  That's even creepier, because that looks like you're wearing someone's skin.  Yeah, it's like some carbon fiber shit.  I didn't know they told him to take the black one off.  The black one was badass.  I know.  I guess that's why.  They just looked like a face.  Who complained?  I don't know if anyone even complained, because it was kind of just a request.  What's the article say?  What, NBA players can't handle black masks now? 
[00:41:30]  I guess.  Sounds racist to me, but.  That's kind of stupid.  Yeah.  I guess the Nets signed Jason Collins to another 10-day contract or something.  10 days, huh?  Well, they've got to keep signing him.  How much does the Down Syndrome kid, how long is he, is he still on a team?  I think so, yeah.  I think, well, they can't like.  They're matching his deal.  Yeah, they've got to re-sign him every time, too.  Are you looking like an asshole?  No, he got signed to another team, remember?  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  He moved on to another team.  He's on the Globetrotters now.  Oh, right.  With the Globetrotters, really? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, boy.  Why couldn't the Globetrotters, you know, sign another one of those?  Oh.  You know, another one of those.  Well, he's good, though, this kid.  Is he good?  He actually can make shots.  Good for him.  So I guess you can't just, you know, go to some special school and grab a kid and sign  him up.  I was great from the three-point line.  I didn't get a contract with the Harlem Globetrotters.  Man.  I should have been a little funny, I guess. 
[00:42:30]  Maybe you should have, yeah.  I was a little funny.  Or a little darker.  Yeah, that too.  Have you ever had a white guy?  No, I think the Harlem Globetrotters, as a goof, put a white guy on there for a little  while.  Yeah?  I think so.  They're all about diversity, right?  Everyone is.  Diversity is not good when it's forced on everyone.  Did you see on the Oscars that small group of young people that were like the Oscars thing  that brought them out of the stage?  You couldn't have gotten a more stereotypical, diverse group. 
[00:43:00]  It's like, we need something that looks diverse.  They had some Arab girl, an Asian guy, the black guy, the geeky white kid.  They collected them all.  Guy with a hair lip.  They had a hair lip guy.  Oh, yeah.  I think he was the Asian guy, too.  Yeah.  Double threat.  Ellen got flack, too.  They called her transphobic.  Ellen did?  Because of her, this is how, this is where we are at her, because of her joke about Liza  Minnelli.  What?  Oh, shut up. 
[00:43:30]  Why would that be transphobic?  Well, you know, because you're looking at a woman and you're saying it's wrong in a  way that she looks masculine.  I guess I didn't, I couldn't, I didn't hear the explanation.  Holy mackerel.  If you can't just even talk about it, like, if you just talk about the transgendered, there's  these groups that'll get upset, no matter what your content.  It was a great line.  Amazing line.  Funny as fuck.  It's called comedy.  Probably one of the edgiest lines I've heard on the Oscars.  It was, it was funny. 
[00:44:00]  Right.  And ballsy.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, so where's that article?  Now I gotta see this.  I don't know, remember where I saw that, to be honest with you.  Second most watched Oscars, by the way, 43 million.  That's pretty good.  I think Billy Crystal has the record at 44, back in 2004, I think.  Oh, I wonder what he did on that one.  Opened to show up.  Scooty-la-ba-dooby-da.  And if anyone cares, that pizza delivery guy made a thousand dollars. 
[00:44:30]  Who made that?  A thousand dollar tip.  What's that guy's name?  Edgar.  Have some pizza I'm going to deliver, boy.  None for you.  A thousand bucks.  Yeah, man, they all tipped in.  They got like 600, Ellen threw in like 400 for them.  I don't know, righteous bucks.  Yeah.  I'm trying to find the Ellen DeGeneres.  I don't know if we have it in here or if I just saw it.  Watch the Oscars, eating some food.  While I was perusing. 
[00:45:00]  And Chelsea Handler's getting some...  Yeah, of course.  She's had a little bit of a jam up to over nothing.  I wonder how she'll handle it.  What's her jam up?  She was just making 12 Years of Slave jokes and trying to push her book, which is called  Uganda, Be Kidding Me.  Uganda, Be Kidding Me.  It's like an African-themed book.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah, she was tying it in with...  Yeah.  Where was she doing all this?  She was tweeting it.  She was live tweeting for...  Who was she doing it for?  Huffington Post.  The Huffington Post.  She was one of the people that they got.  And it said...  It was nothing. 
[00:45:30]  It's like, oh, 12 Years of Slave won.  Go to Africa or buy Uganda, Be Kidding Me.  What the fuck is that?  And then she tweeted some Angelina Jolie adoption.  Yeah, yeah.  Who didn't tweet one of those?  Yeah.  It was...  That was the go-to one.  That was easy, right?  Yeah.  I'm trying to see that they were...  Okay.  Take it away.  Express their outrage.  Yeah, that she would...  Oh, several of her jokes were racially charged,  starting with the response to Lupita's win for Best Supporting Actress. 
[00:46:00]  Angelina Jolie just filed adoption papers.  That's just a funny line that a lot of people came up with, by the way.  Absolutely.  There were a lot of those.  I had him adopting the boat movie guy, though.  Oh, yes.  I want to see the boat movie.  I want to see the boat movie.  She also jumped on the opportunity to promote her upcoming book,  You Gotta Be Kidding Me, Uganda, Be Kidding Me,  which is out Tuesday and did so again when 12 Years a Slave won for Best Picture.  Congratulations.  12 Years a Slave.  Go to Africa or buy Uganda, Be Kidding Me. 
[00:46:30]  How bad is that?  It's not...  Like, what is that?  How is that bad?  This is just lazy.  It's fucking ridiculous.  Whoever wrote this.  Whoever started this, it's just lazy.  I doubt she'll, you know, she'll...  She's in a pretty good place.  She doesn't need to apologize.  There's nothing here.  There's absolutely nothing here.  Who cares?  She's on our show tomorrow, I think.  Oh.  I watched 12 Years a Slave yesterday.  Finally, like, for the first time, like, all the way through.  A little late.  I know. 
[00:47:00]  A little late to the party.  But it was good.  Yeah.  It was a good fucking movie.  Yeah.  Fucking, uh...  Wow.  That's pretty brutal.  Yeah, fucking heavy, man.  Oh!  But it's like, I just...  Like, there's one...  One good white guy, Brad Pitt.  That was it.  Down South, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like one.  All the rest...  I don't think...  I mean, my history might be a little off, but I can't imagine that every white person 
[00:47:30]  in the South put that much energy into hating black people.  I just can't imagine.  It's looked exhausting.  First of all, your history might be a little off.  Your favorite song is Party, like, it's 1799.  No, I like that one master's song as he was singing that little ditty as they're working.  Oh, I remember the song, but I remember...  Oh, jeez, it was bad.  Oh, yeah, that guy who he...  It was Run, Run.  Oh, right, right.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, it was brutal.  Oh, I like that movie because they didn't... 
[00:48:00]  Usually they focus on the good white guy in Hollywood, like in Amistad, and they always  focus on the good white people, but this one didn't.  And that one guy that just fucked him over, took his money and then went back to the guy  who was supposed to mail the letter for him.  Oh, my God, yeah.  And he goes back to the guy and tells him he's got to lie to the master.  Oh, man.  I was shocked.  That was pretty good.  I was shocked at that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You think black people saw that movie?  Holy fuck.  I was thinking what it would be like to sit in a movie theater full of black people  when that movie was on, and then the lights come up, and you're just like, 
[00:48:30]  Hi!  Hi, everyone!  Here, I'm just going to give out money.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Reparations right here.  Here you go.  Don't kill me.  I got plenty for everyone.  Oh, my God.  You'd have to make the I'm Disgusted Two-Face?  Yeah.  I can't believe it.  I never.  We're talking to foreign accents.  If I wasn't more like that Brad Pitt character, I'd be upset.  Please don't hurt me.  You've got to sneak out with five minutes left of the film.  Oh, do you ever.  Just assume you know how it ends.  Oh, no. 
[00:49:00]  They saw that movie?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That's some brutal.  Man, when that Lapita girl is getting whipped.  How fucking awesome is she, though?  That fucking effect they had where the blood is just, like, splashing off her back.  She was good.  Yeah, they were all good.  His cunt wife.  Didn't he want to strangle his fucking cunt wife?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, was she a bad one?  Paul Giamatti was murderable.  His performance was great. 
[00:49:30]  He was murderable.  And very short.  He didn't have a big part, but it was really, like, he was so bad.  How does he walk around after doing that?  I know.  Because people got to look at him like, wait a minute.  You're in craft services?  Just, hey, how you doing?  You're not that good of an actor.  Where's that coming from, sir?  I always think that, you know?  She looked hot tied up on that tree, though.  Lapita?  Fucking ass.  I think you missed the point of the film. 
[00:50:00]  I think you missed the overall message of the film.  I was just in the context of the actress.  That's a good point, yeah.  She's tied to the tree.  She's totally nude from the back.  She's got a nice ass on her.  She's a very, very sexy girl, although I don't think that was meant to be jerk-off fodder.  For guys on Long Island.  Meant to be your masturbation fuel.  Oh, see.  Yeah, that was great.  And the guy who played the slave master who was fucking her, I keep forgetting, what's 
[00:50:30]  his name?  Fast, how do you say his name?  Fast Bender.  Fast Bender.  Was amazing.  Yeah, he was great, too.  Yeah.  As this tortured guy, like he's a fucking slave owner, but he likes this girl.  Yeah.  That was great.  He's brutal, too.  It's just, I think it completely deserved Best Picture, based on all the other movies  that were nominated.  You've seen most of them, too, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't see her.  I didn't see her.  What was her about?  Her.  Good.  Was that the...  Isn't that the Joaquin Phoenix movie? 
[00:51:00]  Was that the Spike Jonze joint?  Yeah.  What was her about?  It was about a guy who falls in love with his...  I don't need to know for real.  Sam, you got a boring.  I didn't make the movie.  I didn't need to know for real.  Her.  Her.  And Gravity getting all those accolades.  For technical, I agree.  It's amazing.  But...  Well, directing, that's... 
[00:51:30]  It's kind of weird.  That's stupid.  It's weird to give a director that...  I don't know.  Look at all the scenes in American Hustle.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, that's so involved.  You need a really good director for all those scenes that they pulled off.  And CGI-ing.  So much of the movie is CGI.  To have a director...  And you've got to depend on your special effects people.  Right.  So what is he doing in the end?  Winning an Oscar.  Yeah, but, I mean, American Hustle, there's so many different costumes and sets. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  So many players coming and going.  Real live camera moves.  All that.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I think that was a bad move.  Weird.  I think...  Yeah.  And I thought the movie was genuinely dull.  The story itself was, you know, all right.  She's going here.  She's going there.  She's trying to get home.  Bah.  Let's not do this.  Yeah.  What?  Oscar.  We do it with everything.  It was a really good movie.  It was, but it wasn't... 
[00:52:30]  We beat the shit out of everything.  You've got to see it in the theater.  I thought 12 Years a Slave was really good.  I saw it in the theater.  I saw it in the theater.  I thought Gravity was great to look at.  The story was simple, of course, but...  But it's like going on a fucking ride.  It's like, then you might as well just be on a ride, because that's what it was.  It looked great.  3D.  IMAX.  It was fucking incredible.  But story-wise and stuff, who gives a fuck?  I think it was the Avatar thing.  They felt like they didn't really need a...  They didn't need it.  ...a big story.  It looks great.  Right.  Because if it looks amazing like it did... 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Puttering George Clooney.  Puttering around the fucking cosmos.  Right, right.  It was like George Jetson.  There was one moment in...  I looked at...  Who directed 12 Years a Slave?  The guy's name is Steve McQueen, right?  Mm-hmm.  Where the fucking...  Black Steve McQueen.  Black Steve McQueen.  Where the guy who's...  I forget his real name.  He does something fucked up, and he's being punished.  And they have him with a noose around his neck.  Oh, my God.  And he's standing on his tippy toes.  How long that went.  In the mud, yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Yes.  And he has to balance, because if he slips, he's going to hang himself.  And he's fucking...  How long did they...  The fact they kept the camera on this guy, it showed him being there all day.  Right.  And it was uncomfortably long.  The kids are playing out in the field while he's just hanging there.  But they wouldn't let you out of it.  It was really...  That was a director's decision.  That's directing.  That was amazing.  That's amazing directing.  Right.  Because you want to show how long that is.  Right.  Because you're like, just get out of this already.  It was uncomfortable to watch.  It was long and tedious, and you got uncomfortable, and it was like, I guess that was the intention 
[00:54:00]  of it for me.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I really believe they blew it with the directing Oscar.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  But what are you going to do?  I liked it, though.  Good story.  Great acting.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was good.  Good for you.  Nice.  Well, Scott Shannon thanked us again.  Oh, Scott.  We didn't have this at the end of the show yesterday.  Well, we did, but we were busy with Cesar Millan.  I hope there's no underhanded or backhanded compliments in this, because that'll be war. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, yeah, we're listening closely, how he handles, how he kisses our ass.  Oh, boy.  We listen to every word.  So the Scott and Todd thing, those two split up.  Todd's doing his show.  Scott's doing his show.  And because of one lousy, not lousy in a bad way, one lousy 15-minute phone call, we're  all Team Scott.  Who wouldn't be?  I wrote him yesterday saying I've never seen anyone turn the opinion of an audience around 
[00:55:00]  in 15 minutes like he did on Friday.  It was unbelievable.  We were all ready to just listen to his new show and beat the crap out of him.  Oh, yeah.  He was next on the list.  And now I don't have the desire to do that.  Wish him nothing but the best.  There's rumors that one of the Jerky Boys wants on our show to discuss some things.  Probably Johnny.  He's written me and thanked me for the way we could say that.  Of course it's Johnny.  But I'm hearing rumors he might be ready to come on and do a little talking about it. 
[00:55:30]  I'd love to have Johnny on.  Because it looks like he's been aware of the whole Todd thing for many years.  Pounds, baby.  Pounds.  So just doing Jerky Boys is bad.  That's not good.  Yeah.  That can't help your brand.  No.  So here's Scott Shannon on his first day at CBS FM here in New York City.  And checking in this morning is an old friend of Joe's and mine.  And her name is Naomi DiClemente.  Oh, my goodness.  I didn't realize how funny you are without the other guy. 
[00:56:00]  You're really funny.  That's not weird.  That's funny.  That's exactly what we said Friday.  Invigorated.  Right.  Recharged.  Yeah.  I gave him a little advice, too.  Oh, jeez.  I told him, just stay loose.  I said, stay loose and just go for it.  Let me tell you something, kid.  Why am I giving him advice?  But I had to, because I'm like, don't go back to, like, that crappy regular radio BS. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Just keep it loose.  And I said, you have nothing to lose.  Just go and have fun.  Hey, look.  It's that niggle kid.  Yeah.  What's up, Eric?  What I didn't realize yesterday, too, is after his intro, his first song was an old song  by the OJs, Backstabber.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  That's a little telling.  Mm-hmm.  Put on some backstabber.  Is there a song called Miserable Son of a Bitch Fuckwad? 
[00:57:00]  I'll play that.  He knew that Todd wanted to do the show by himself all that time.  It's like, what the fuck was going on behind the scenes there, man?  I would love to know.  Oof.  Ah.  We noticed it.  Like, it was obvious on air.  Yeah.  Yeah, Todd said, uh, I'm sorry, Scott said.  Has Todd addressed this at all?  No.  Nah, why would he?  No.  I didn't even thank him on his first show.  Nah, why would he?  No.  If you're reinventing, uh, you know, regular radio like Todd's got her.  Oh, yeah.  Wouldn't you just let it all out?  You'd think.  Let it all out.  You would think, but no. 
[00:57:30]  That'll get the people talking.  No, uh, yes.  You'd get some headlines if you start talking about, uh, what happened.  Right.  Yesterday.  I'm sorry, right?  It's going to be a fun show.  It's going to be a fun, like, for a soccer mom's show.  Why would you address something unpleasant?  Yesterday on his show, he said he knew, uh, back in December that this was happening,  and he didn't leave until February 7th, I think it was.  So he knew for months.  That's probably a contract thing.  Yeah.  They just didn't, uh.  He had no compete?  I mean, he didn't have a no compete again. 
[00:58:00]  He's still doing business with them, so I think that's why they let it out.  He has his true oldies network with Cumulus.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that he has partial ownership in it.  So I think they came to an agreement and just let him go.  Maybe he decided to go, too.  Maybe he could have re-signed for the same thing, but he's like, fuck, this is not fun  anymore.  I don't know.  Maybe.  I think it was an old, hey, take a hike.  Yeah.  Maybe.  No, man.  No, he was in touch with CBS a while ago.  Oh.  Yeah, that doesn't just pop up quickly like it did. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, that's true.  He knows how to take care of himself.  Isn't it how long it takes to hammer out a contract and stuff?  Come on.  He's been in the business forever.  He knows how to take care of himself.  Right.  You know, the signs were on the, the writing was on the wall.  I work for five.  Hey, hey.  And he's probably started making some phone calls, and then they figured, all right,  we could do all this in February, late February.  Yeah.  The money this guy has made over the years, when he left New York to go to L.A., he had  a contract with Westwood One.  It's $5 million a year.  This is $89. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  When he came back to New York, he still had $5 million a year with his new agreement  with ABC at PLJ.  So if he started in 91 at $5 million, and that station has just been top billing ever since,  there's no way he's made less than that.  Yeah.  Good for him.  $5 million a year.  Well, he had this to say at the end of his first show.  I got to say hi to Debbie Cole.  She's a new listener.  Denise Robertson from Palisades Park.  She made the switch.  Okay.  And Jerry Mayer heard about us from Opie and Anthony. 
[00:59:30]  He's trying to say, I'm not sure if he's going to be around long.  No, it's not.  He says he's going to give us this week.  He's trying us out this week.  And by the way, I got to say thanks to the friends of O&A for recruiting new listeners  for our show.  Like I said, I don't know how long we're going to be able to hold on to it.  Yeah, right.  But for a while.  I don't know how long.  Yeah, you never know.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:00:00]  He doesn't.  Hey, on a daily basis, we don't know how long we're going to hold on to them.  Of course.  Of course.  Exactly.  Bastards.  We don't know where we lost most of them.  If we have one minute of shitty radio, they're going to let us know about it.  So, well, I mean, he does a very different type of show.  Oh, obviously.  But if I need an oldie or two, I'll check it out.  Go on over there.  You know what?  And I bet he'll do more honest radio and more genuine talk radio than fucking his old  like.  Wait, you hear his voice there?  I know.  It's so different. 
[01:00:30]  It's not like.  I couldn't understand what he was saying on the other show because it's like they had  his mic down and he was just in the background.  Right.  I don't know.  He didn't have any real oomph to it.  While the young superstar took over.  While the young superstar led the charge.  He stinks.  It's fucking awful.  It really bothers me.  He's everything I hate about regular radio.  He stinks.  Todd. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, we got to go in there.  You're not talking.  You're talking too much over there, jerk face.  It's not like the jerky boys.  I say jerk face.  Yeah, exactly.  You can't say you're going to reinvent regular radio and then do the exact same show you  were doing a mere two weeks prior.  This big fucking grandiose intro and open like he's going to do something cutting edge and brand new and then he does the same.  And then nothing.  How was Rob Ford on Jimmy Kimmel?  I didn't see it. 
[01:01:30]  Did you see it?  It was so good.  He's the greatest.  Was it really good?  It was really good.  I didn't see it.  First, like, he just asked him about all the humiliating stuff.  Right.  He did nothing to, like, make him feel comfortable.  Nah.  The best segment was he just stood him up in front of a video screen and watched all the Rob Ford videos and then said, what was that?  Nice.  Like, what were you doing?  Who were you talking to?  Give me a little taste of this.  He looks like Goldfinger.  I got all this DVR.  I haven't been able to see it yet. 
[01:02:00]  I want to go through some of these videos.  If you don't mind my report, stand right there.  And you can take us through these things because I hope maybe we can answer some questions here.  All right.  Let's roll the first one.  Answer some questions.  Don't hold the part, brother.  He dies right tight, brother.  Okay.  Brother, you can never see this.  I can never see this.  Here you go, brother.  Now, somebody who is clearly not your friend videotaped you without your knowledge here.  Who are you talking about in that video?  You don't know. 
[01:02:30]  Exactly.  You have no idea.  You have that many enemies that you don't know which one this was?  All right.  Let's go to the next video.  Oh, the bump of applause.  This is the famous state queen video.  You're doing a Jamaican accent here.  It's called Patois.  It's called Patois.  Do you do other accents or is that the only one?  Now, you were, in this video, what was going on?  Just went out with a friend, a few friends of mine.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:03:00]  It's a private setting and private friends.  And there's no secret I have a lot of Jamaican friends.  And that's how we speak in a private setting.  If someone wants to date me, they can date me.  Have you been to Jamaica?  No.  I would love to take you there for spring break sometime.  From T-Go Bay.  All right.  Next video.  This is the famed football video.  The football's in his ass.  The football's in his ass.  Why is he running at you?  Is he tackling you?  Because this video ends right here.  I'm not quite sure what he's doing.  Okay.  I would like to see you be a part of the NFL combine, I have to say. 
[01:03:30]  Next video.  We have your brother, Doug.  See?  Thank you, Counselor Acey.  You've got your own issues.  Counselor.  And then there's you.  Counselor Ford, please direct the question through the chair to the staff.  Now, is that the middle finger?  No.  He's making references like he's driving and then drinking.  Oh, okay.  Drinking and driving.  First of all, I want you on my team in charades. 
[01:04:00]  But were you classically trained in pantomime or was that off the cuff?  You know, these counselors come across like they're whole later than now.  And a lot of them have more angles than the dog's hind legs.  So these people, you know, they're just talking about, you know, drinking and all that.  And the person I was referring to was just pulled over the other night for drinking and driving.  I see.  He's so nice.  All right.  Next video.  This is a little embarrassed, though.  The money was running on the mayor's street.  He's attacked somebody.  No.  He's attacked somebody. 
[01:04:30]  That lady, you apologized to her afterwards.  Is it that once you get up to a certain speed, there's no stopping?  You get very excited.  All right.  What else do we have here?  Now, this is my favorite.  I have to say, this is my favorite of all the videos.  This is a Christmas parade.  And this is you passing out candy canes and literally dumping them on the children.  As if you're feeding birds. 
[01:05:00]  Let's tell her that.  That's what I do.  Just give them a couple each next time, you know?  And then one more, I believe we have.  Now, this is great because after all that's gone on in the City Hall, you are still enjoying  yourself enough to just dance reggae style. 
[01:05:30]  Again, another reason for our trip to Jamaica together.  Oh, it's the best.  And then there's the guy.  You really get into it.  He is out of his mind.  And everybody's happy.  This seems so very Canadian to me.  Like, actually, no.  You know, that's our trip to Austin, Texas.  And in Austin, Texas, they always have a break.  And they have a band come in and play.  You were in Austin there?  No.  Oh.  That's where we got it from.  Oh, I said, let's have a band come in and play.  And they were playing Bob Marley.  And like I said, I like Bob Marley.  So council got up and danced and we had a good time. 
[01:06:00]  That was great.  It broke the tension.  Everyone enjoyed it.  All right.  Oh, my God.  He looks like he's wearing a black suit and just a beat, like a red  red tie.  Right.  And you can tell he's a little embarrassed by his face.  Yes, definitely.  His face is red from embarrassing and probably maybe a little  something else.  During the interview part, Jimmy Kimmel acknowledged how much  Rob Ford was sweating and then patted him down with a  Yeah, he wiped his forehead, leaned over, and blotted his sweat.  Takes balls for Rob Ford to do that.  Yeah.  I wonder why he's doing it. 
[01:06:30]  Like, what is he?  What is he?  He has nothing to lose.  He's nothing to lose.  Make him more likable, I guess.  Oh, maybe.  And he's just enjoying the fact that he's a celebrity now.  Yeah, he loves celebrity.  That's it.  I'd love to interview him.  Oh, yeah.  He loves being a celebrity.  You think they flew him out?  I bet you they flew him out.  Oh, yeah.  Certain.  Yeah, they kind of got the money to do this.  Yeah, yeah.  We could, well, from Toronto, we could get him here.  Because I'm on a train.  God, these, it feels like these late night shows have just  gotten so much better.  Not to take away from Leno or Letterman or anything, but it's, 
[01:07:00]  I don't know, people are really watching these clips.  Yeah, it's kind of a new era.  It's also because they're embracing this new stuff.  Like, we keep saying it, but they're embracing it.  They're not fighting it and sticking to the old school.  They're kind of going with these new...  Every day, though, one of these guys has a really good clip  that's pretty much going viral.  They have viral videos every day.  Every day.  Every day.  Like, Jimmy Kimmel, I mean, Jimmy Fallon had the chick on  who John Travolta mispronounced her name and did the...  Oh, really?  ...classroom musical performance deal that he does. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, nice.  Yeah, I don't know.  What's that?  It's where he gets, like, a very popular artist with a catchy song  and gets them in the roots to perform the song with kids' instruments.  With, like, little, like, in elementary school,  you'd use that little xylophone thing.  Another really smart bit.  Just play part of it.  Wow.  And it's always catchy songs.  This is Let It Go, right? 
[01:08:00]  Delta Zim.  Delta Zim.  What the fuck?  Couldn't keep it in.  Heaven knows which one line.  One, two, three. 
[01:08:30]  Let that be.  Let that be.  Be the good girl you always had to be.  Triangle.  Triangle is a staple.  What a clever way to get...  Just to do it differently.  Yeah.  He did this with Robin Thicke, Carly Rae Jepsen.  No, we'll let it go.  Can't hold it back anymore.  And no, we'll let it go.  Turn away and slam the door. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Instead of just having her come out and sing it.  What they're going to say.  Let the storm break.  You think she's sick of singing this already?  Oh, yeah.  This is not even the...  Did you...  He did...  What was the first one?  He did the one that was actually better than this.  What was the first one he did?  Chippy.  That was pretty good.  Get over it.  Get over it.  Pitch in the fit.  Do you like that line, pitch in the fit? 
[01:09:30]  I like pitch in the fit.  Pitch in the fit.  Grandma.  You know, Frozen became the 18th movie to make a billion dollars worldwide.  What are some of those other movies in there, you think?  Avatar.  Lion King.  Got to go Avatar.  Got to go Lion King.  Got to go maybe Titanic.  Got to go...  Hmm.  It's more the recent ones, right?  Probably kids' movies, too, more.  Oh, and the 3D movies. 
[01:10:00]  Got to go maybe...  I want to...  Really?  Just let me see the list.  Avatar's number one.  Because the 3D movies are more expensive.  I think it's two.  What's number two?  Is number two...  Avatar made $2,782 worldwide.  That's huge.  $2,782.  That's wrong.  That's wrong.  That's massive.  Huge money.  Then you got Titanic.  Marvel's The Avengers?  Really?  James Cameron is number one and two on the list. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  Wow.  That's pretty amazing.  Jesus.  Then you got the Harry Potter.  All right.  Iron Man 3.  The Transformers.  Lord of the Rings.  Skyfall.  They're all 3D movies.  Wow.  Which one was Skyfall?  The James Bond movie.  The most recent Bond movie.  Oh, right, right, right.  You know what?  I didn't see that one yet.  Jesus.  The Dark Knight.  You got the pirates in there.  The Caribbean.  The Dark Knight hit a billion dollars?  Yep.  Wow.  Toy Story 3 is on that list.  Damn.  And you got another Pirates in there. 
[01:11:00]  You got Jurassic Park.  Star Wars Episode I.  The Phantom Menace.  Oof.  Alice in Wonderland?  I guess so.  2010?  That was the 3D one.  I didn't know that many people.  You got a Hobbit movie up there.  You got the Dark Knight again.  The other Dark Knight.  Yeah, you got Dark Knight and then Dark Knight Rises.  And then finally, Frozen has officially made that list.  With the Lion King just knocking on the door.  Oh, I see.  Just knocking on the door to make that list.  Knock, knock, knock. 
[01:11:30]  Gotcha.  Nice.  Not bad.  But Frozen already in what?  18th place.  And the DVDs aren't even out yet.  Every parent has to pick that one up.  Yep.  So they're going to move up that list.  This is just box office.  Oh, okay.  They don't do the DVDs and all that?  No.  Gotcha.  But I don't even think it's out in Japan or China yet.  Why?  What are they waiting for?  Well, they do things differently.  What's wrong with those people? 
[01:12:00]  They're still trying to translate it?  Yeah, yeah.  That's got to be a bitch.  We got people disagreeing on our movie choices here.  Oh, shit.  Let's say hi to Danny in D.C.  Danny.  Hey, guys.  Thanks for taking my call.  Hello.  Sure.  Welcome aboard.  Thanks.  Hey, I just want to let you know, I really think that Alfonso Cuaron did deserve the Oscar  for Best Director, and here's why.  For Gravity, for the people that don't know the players, because I didn't even know that  was his name, to be honest with you.  That's right.  Yes. 
[01:12:30]  If you look at all the categories that they took home, Oscars for visual effects, sound  design, sound editing, it was really Alfonso Cuaron's vision that brought all these guys  together, and that made this movie pop.  Yeah, well, I could say, oh, I want to make a movie about underwater, and we're going to  do this, and it needs to be all CGI.  Go.  Yeah, that's a terrible argument.  Well, not necessarily.  You can't just win Best Director because you have a vision.  Yeah.  You've got to look at the scenes in the movie. 
[01:13:00]  Well, absolutely.  But, I mean, if you listen to all their speeches, they talk about, I mean, how he put them in  the right place, but, I mean, it was him that he had to bring it all together, right?  These people are experts in their own fields, but, I mean, they don't know how to make a  movie, right?  I mean, he did the best.  I don't know.  Sort of like, you know, the reason that Steve Jobs is so highly regarded, you know?  He didn't invent the iPhone, but he put all the right things in the right place, and  it was his vision that brought all the correct things. 
[01:13:30]  Isn't that more of a producer, though?  Yeah.  I just don't.  Where you put all the parts together?  As far as your good old school directing goes, um...  I want to see actual directing.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, after you get all the special effects and all that figured out, then what is he  really doing?  Yeah.  He still has to direct, and he did a very good job.  Yes, of course.  But, I mean, 12 Years a Slave, and you got, I mean, American Hustle, the scenes in that  movie.  It's got computer guys fucking making camera moves. 
[01:14:00]  They didn't even use the real IRF.  No, that wasn't IRF.  That was some CGI IRF.  I wouldn't be able to tell if, you know, if you didn't know what visual effects were.  But that goes to Ann's point.  That was a computer guy.  A special effects guy.  Some poor unknown geek sitting there fucking...  Right.  ...working.  Anyway, thanks, guys.  All right, sir.  All right.  Yeah.  And then, finally, we go to Snowy in Michigan.  I think I know Snowy.  He calls every once in a while.  Or is it a girl?  I forget. 
[01:14:30]  Snowy, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing?  I just recognized the name.  Sorry.  What's up, buddy?  You got the snowman.  Right.  The snowman.  I had to ask Ann.  He said that one girl was hot tied to a tree.  Was she hot her before or after they whipped her?  Oh, that's...  Oh, you better answer correctly here, Ann.  That's terrible.  I wasn't putting it in the context of the whipping at all.  It was just, you know, a naked chick tied to a tree from the back.  I was just noticing her ass.  Oh, okay.  That's all. 
[01:15:00]  That's what I said.  That's all.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Bye, man.  Punch it out.  Love the show.  He needed to know that.  Of course you do.  Why don't we take a break?  Yeah, right.  Where's our food?  Where is our grub?  Here comes down the hall right now.  Ah, I see him.  It's walking...  It's being walked down the hall.  The Swiss cheese pervert's at it again.  No way.  Yep.  I thought he was in jail.  We got the story.  And we have the exclusive story.  And we might be late to this because, you know, of the internet. 
[01:15:30]  So a lot of people have seen this by now, but the fake chef on our local TV.  Yeah, he's great.  We got it.  I heard about it, but I didn't see the clip.  It's hilarious.  Anytime you make the fucking news look like the assholes they are.  They're just a bunch of idiots, the local news.  They just assume everything in front of them is...  Has to be real.  And it's so obvious this guy is just playing them.  Just fucking with them.  We got two videos.  Well, we got the montage, but then you...  I didn't see the one where it's the whole segment. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, I like the whole segment better.  There's also another video that's related.  The yo-yo guy.  We haven't played that on the show.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen that.  It's several years old.  Yeah, I saw that a while ago.  What was the yo-yo guy again?  He pretended he was a yo-yo expert, and he went on the news, and...  How bad was his yo-yo?  It was terrible.  Horrible yo-yo.  And how did the news handle it?  They handled it like there was not...  Like he was still an expert.  Like he ended the segment as if he was still...  Even though...  Where do you do this?  Even though that's old, we should play a little of that after the break, too.  So good.

[01:26:30]  Lars gives a call.  God, this is like 98, something like that.  99, maybe?  And he goes, um...  Dude, what are you doing tonight?  I said, I'm playing down the village.  Let's fucking hang out, and I'm gonna meet up with some friends.  It's gonna be great.  On the way over, we're in a cab.  We cabbed it, and some kid from NYU left his knapsack.  With all his books and notebooks.  So, you know what?  I'll be a nice guy.  How cool is the guy from Saturday Night Live is gonna send him back his books? 
[01:27:00]  Well, this is a thorn in Lars' ass.  For the minute, I get it.  For the minute, I get it.  Dude, what are you doing?  I get the fucking nap.  Give me the fuck.  It's ridiculous.  You look like a bag walking around with this fucking knapsack.  So, I'm walking around with this thing.  I said, I'm gonna give it back.  Why does the knapsack bother you?  It's fucking stupid.  Fuck that guy.  He's irresponsible.  Fuck him.  He'll teach him a lesson.  He tears the knapsack off my back.  So, what are you doing?  He tosses it across the street, hits some chick in the leg, and it opens up, and the bags go 
[01:27:30]  all over.  And he's walking down the village going like this.  There's your fucking knapsack, huh?  Are we hanging?  Fuck the knapsack, huh?  Huh?  I'm like, Lars, what are you doing?  Chill out.  He keeps getting in my face.  Are we hanging or what?  I went, I don't know if I can live up to this.  I talk a great game, but I don't know if I can live up to this status.  Stay tuned for more Bedtime Stories with Jim Brewer. 
[01:28:00]  Opie and Anthony are back on Sirius XM.  Oh, I know there's no reason, Travis.  I like it.  Good morning, everyone.  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton.  Oh, yeah.  On your radio dial.  On your radio dial.  Radio dial. 
[01:28:30]  Like that 90s.  You like that grunge?  Who doesn't, right?  I like the grunge.  I'm kind of trapped there.  I kind of got trapped right there in the 90s.  You did, huh?  Yeah.  That shit is old now.  Oh, fucking classic rock now.  That shit is old.  Jesus H.  Christ.  That's like listening to the 70s when we were in the 90s. 
[01:29:00]  I know.  Or something like that.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You know what I'm talking about.  It is, right?  Yeah.  70s, 70s, 90s.  We're done with the Oscars.  We don't need to talk about the Oscars anymore.  This woman in Japan is 116 fucking years old.  She looks like a sucker fish.  No, 116.  Her kids, her two kids were in their 90s.  And her husband, she got married in 19, she was born in 1898.  Got married in like 1916 or something, or 1918. 
[01:29:30]  Wow.  Her husband died in 1931.  Wow.  That's her?  Yeah.  That's not bad for 116.  She's like a man.  Yeah.  And she said like a good night's sleep every night.  She gets eight hours.  Oh, boy.  It presses me.  That's why I'm thinking of it.  Oh, Jimmy.  I think it'd be cool to be 116 as long as you could still dream.  You know what I mean?  Your dreams, you must be rocking still.  Still doing stuff.  I think so.  What does she do?  Does she like have tea every day?  Construction worker. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, exactly.  It's really weird.  She smokes cigarettes.  She takes it in the ass.  I guess she, yeah.  What's her big thing?  Because they always have to talk about their daily life and what they do on a daily basis.  Well, she sleeps a lot.  That's pretty much it.  Eight hours isn't a lot.  Eight hours.  Well, yeah.  I guess for old people, eight hours is a lot.  What's her thing?  They have to talk about her thing.  And every day she's still, yeah.  She insists that her favorite meat is sushi. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, boy.  Particularly mackerel.  Oh, God.  And now she looks like a mackerel.  Right.  Look at her face.  She looks like a fucking mackerel.  On vinegar steamed rice.  She only eats it once a month, though.  Oh, she only has it once a month.  God, if you're 116, you eat that shit every day.  Why are you waiting once a month to have one of your favorite meals?  116, man.  She's seen a few things.  Oh, my God.  Would you?  I mean, you know.  Oh, my God.  She remembers the First World War. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  What do you think's worse?  Her, uh, for JJ.  Or.  Or.  Oh, the back door?  Or.  Oh, which.  I'm trying to think which one.  Oh.  Oh, the smell? 
[01:31:30]  Yes.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Now that makes sense.  Okay.  Wow.  See, my shit's too inside.  It sucks.  At least you don't want to be mean.  No.  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  Nothing.  That comes out eventually.  Relax.  Well, it comes out in the wash.  What else about this, uh, what's the problem?  I wish.  The oldest authenticated person ever was Gene, blah, blah, blah, blah, of France, who died 
[01:32:00]  at the age of 122.  Wow.  Died at the age of 103.  We're going to have a lot of 100-year-olds now, so.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Medical technology.  I've been in and out of a few homes lately, and you see them, man.  They're way up there.  They're in their 90s.  Yeah.  Still doing all right, too.  Walking the hallways.  Crazy.  They're only there because, you know, their family's finally said enough.  Get, uh...  Family's had it.  Yeah, because you can tell they're still all right. 
[01:32:30]  But you can only be around them for so long.  And finally go, really?  Yeah.  Really?  We're putting you over here for a while.  Enough of you.  Where you'll be among other people your age.  It'll be good.  Oh, yeah.  Play some Pinochle.  Pinochle.  It's all about the bingo.  Bingo?  Yeah.  A lot of bingo.  Hey, let's look at the TV chef.  Oh, yeah.  That pranked everybody.  Is this relatively new? 
[01:33:00]  It happened over Christmas.  And what local TV news channel fell for this?  He went to five different morning shows in Wisconsin and Illinois.  How did he get, uh, booked?  Well, apparently it's the same people.  What do you mean?  Look at our local news.  Yeah.  I would assume it would be very easy to get yourself booked on a local TV news show.  Yeah, I'm trying to figure out, like, how you go about it.  You've got to have a good scam.  And he had a good scam in this case.  And he said he had this book.  And he made a fake cover for the book. 
[01:33:30]  Because in one of the videos, it's hilarious.  Because he had a book signing that he was promoting at Barnes & Noble.  And he said, well, I've got to cancel the book signing because the books didn't come in.  Books didn't come in yet.  Right.  I want to cancel the book signing.  So what, does he put out, like, a press release thing and send it to the...  Sure.  He probably has somebody call.  Or he probably calls because he's not famous.  So he could call and say, hey, my client, even though he's the same guy.  I mean, it's pretty good to be able to get that far. 
[01:34:00]  Right.  It's him and this other guy who are also behind the Yo-Yo guy from a couple years ago.  Yeah.  They created the Found Footage Festival.  So this is all trying just to promote their Found Footage Festival.  What's that?  It's just like a film fest full of...  It's so much alliteration.  Found footage.  Yes.  It's like where they first started playing the Winnebago Man.  Oh, okay.  Like where they find tapes that have been circulating everywhere.  Oh, okay.  And they make a whole film festival.  Where is this?  Winnebago Man. 
[01:34:30]  If you have never seen that, that is really, really good.  Accoutrement.  All right.  Let's look at the TV chef that was pranking the local news.  Do you want to look at the montage or the full segment?  I like the full segment just because you get how awful it is.  All right.  Full segment and then we'll fill in the blanks because I saw the montage one.  Okay.  I got some thoughts on the montage one.  Oh, good.  Or my favorite parts of it.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  Something in the kitchen.  Well, I'm not cooking. 
[01:35:00]  You're lucky because I'm actually not cooking.  But tis the season for get-togethers.  And more often than not, that translates into leftovers.  So this morning, you're in luck.  Chef Keith Gerke is here, author of Leftovers Rights, Making the Winner of Last Night's Dinner.  Pretty good title, right?  That's a great book title.  Thank you very much.  Yes, thanks for being here.  Thank you for having me.  Yes.  Pause.  I swear to you, I would be suspicious already.  Right away.  Why aren't they suspicious?  He's got his chef hat on.  He looks like an idiot.  Leftovers, right.  But I think he's purposely trying to look like an idiot. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's not trying to blend in too much.  No.  He wants it perfectly obvious that he's goofing on them.  Yeah, he wants it to be completely absurd.  Right.  The thing, my mother, Mama Gerke, grew up making creative, fun leftovers.  And, you know, nine times out of ten, you're throwing leftovers away.  Or I feed them to my dog.  I've got a little dog champion.  And fable little star.  Right.  And she loves you.  She's a, you know what?  Fable little star.  Your family deserves the leftovers. 
[01:36:00]  But sometimes it can be like, oh, the same turkey over and over.  Exactly.  So you're getting creative here.  Let's get started here.  Yeah.  First of all, mashed potatoes, boring, right?  Right.  How about a mashed potato ice cream cone?  What do you think about that?  That's fun.  All right.  So you just basically, this is real simple.  You could have your daughter do this or whoever.  You put a little scoop of gravy.  It can be room temperature because your hand kind of warms it up.  It's like a drumstick.  It's kind of like one of those frozen things.  You just put in some of this.  But the fun part comes with the toppings.  So I have to go ahead and put some.  These are your sprinkles.  I think this is like a Sunday ball. 
[01:36:30]  Like corn sprinkles?  Okay.  Yeah.  So put in some corn sprinkles.  Corn sprinkles.  Come on.  And put your cranberry cherry on top.  She's putting corn.  To get the kids involved, too.  We talk about getting them involved in the kitchen.  This is easier to do it.  It's so important.  She's lying in sinker.  She's just buying this.  Why would you buy this?  Because she's in it.  She doesn't know.  Like she's been told this is the segment.  And now she's in it.  She's holding an ice cream cone with mashed potatoes in it.  And gravy in it.  And warm.  And your hand.  She's a room temperature because your hand will warm it up.  Your hand will warm it up. 
[01:37:00]  Room temperature gravy.  And then she's trying to find the hook on it.  Oh, it is good because when you can get the kids involved.  The kids involved.  The kids involved.  And she's putting her what on top?  Her corn.  Her corn and her cranberry for cherry.  Her corn sprinkles.  And her cranberry.  Cranberry cherry.  Cherry.  You think that looks good?  Awful.  Is that?  How awful.  And you put.  He has like one of those little cones.  Yeah.  And you put the gravy in first.  So it's just now you eat the mashed potatoes. 
[01:37:30]  Then you just have an ice cream cone full of warm gravy.  You're not getting to the gravy.  No.  Just a drink.  Not even warm gravy.  Room temperature.  When you put the gravy on top.  Right.  No, you have to start with the gravy.  Soaking it into the cone.  Right.  All right.  Let's continue.  This is great.  How fun.  But to get the kids involved, too.  We talk about getting them involved so often in the kitchen.  And this is an easy way to do it.  So important.  And, you know, one thing.  Let's talk turkey.  Okay.  We're talking Thanksgiving.  We're talking turkey.  How sweet that is.  And I think a lot of people, they don't like turkey.  Because what I hear over and over is when they, you know, microwave it. 
[01:38:00]  And when it has the smell.  It kind of is like, you know, you take off the lid.  And it's like, who farted?  Or what, you know.  And it's like.  What it is, I found.  There's bacteria that forms like a flatulence smell.  Or kind of like a bathroom smell.  But it's fine.  It's perfect.  Oh, my God.  And she's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Who eats turkey that smells like shit?  Smells like flatulence.  There's a thing on there.  Flatulence is like a bathroom smell.  This guy's great.  Please say if you just put it in enough stuff, it doesn't matter. 
[01:38:30]  It just covers that up.  Yeah.  All right.  Case in point.  We've got right here.  You've heard of ants on a law.  Right.  The kindergarten favorite with celery.  Here we have ants on a leg.  That's so cute.  A clover of spoof on that, isn't it?  Yeah.  That is really cute.  Why don't you take a bite of these?  These are actually good.  If you get a cranberry in the bite.  She's eating.  You know, because then you've got your mashed potatoes, and it's all in one.  Kids have a lot of them.  That's convenient.  Here's my favorite.  It's a drumstick.  A turkey drumstick.  That you just spread mashed potatoes on. 
[01:39:00]  And cranberries.  And put cranberries on top.  Yeah.  And she's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  She doesn't look like she's enjoying it.  Because his theory is that if you take the turkey out of the fridge and put the mashed potatoes  and cranberries on top of it, it'll remove the flat smell.  The flat smell.  She's just buying it.  The bathroom smell.  From the bacteria.  Right.  She just eats it.  We've got to get this guy in the shower somehow. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, yeah.  This one's a little fun.  You remember hand turkeys in kindergarten?  Right.  You're tracing your hand?  Right.  Let's do that on flatbread.  Let's create a fun turkey sandwich.  So I've got a marker there.  We've got scissors.  You just...  Oh, cool.  Oh, cool.  Yes.  Okay.  The marker on the bread you're eating.  It's a Sharpie.  And she goes, oh, cool.  You can't stress enough.  You don't want to ingest the marker.  We're not recommending that.  And safety is important, too.  Like, why don't you go ahead and take your scissors, cut that out.  They're cutting Peter with scissors. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah, you can't...  I mean, I do stress.  We have a motto in the Gerke family.  Accidents stink.  You don't want to have an accident.  So when you're doing things, you know, with kids here, you've got to be...  In the family.  Accidents stink.  That's a good family motto to have.  In the Gerke family.  In the Gerke family.  Gerke.  What type of coincidence would it be if somebody who dedicated his life to turkey leftovers  actually had the last name of Gerke?  Gerke.  Right.  Right.  What is Gerke?  He said that...  It just rhymes with turkey. 
[01:40:30]  Turkey.  Yeah, he said it's the Gerke family.  Oh, I didn't even catch that.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  But, oh, this is the best.  He's cutting out her pita bread.  Well, you know what they always say.  Turkey hand.  Accidents stink.  Stink, right.  Oh, it's a good family motto.  Right.  It's very, very good.  And kids, you know, with kids here, you've got to be sure that...  Be careful.  Yeah.  You can actually cut it for them if you want.  Now, you microwave the turkey to heat it up.  Mm-hmm.  And you're going to actually make two of these so you can have a top and a bottom. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, and it's like a sandwich.  Yeah.  And a lot of chefs don't like microwaves.  I think they're fine.  They're a chef's best friend.  You know, they are...  No, they're right.  Yeah.  It's a nice sandwich.  They're a chef's best friend.  He's awesome.  Such a great fucking goop.  I think they're fine.  And she's just running with it.  Oh, yeah, she is.  She's in it, dude.  She doesn't know what to do.  She's got to make it work.  No.  Oh, she's completely believing.  Yeah.  Dedicated to it.  That is suspicious when the chef comes on advocating for microwaves. 
[01:41:30]  Some chef's best friend.  I think they're fine.  They're a chef's best friend.  They're real life.  It's what most of the coffee use.  Yeah.  It's a time saver.  And all these recipes work in real life.  She's cutting on her tricky hand.  And so what you do is...  Mine's a little sloppy here this morning.  Mine is, too.  You'll get the idea.  Okay.  And then what we do is let's scoop on some of the turkey.  Here's my hand.  Okay.  And then you put on your hand.  Generally, you'd want to get more marker off than that.  But we'll do our best.  Just for TV to get it.  Okay.  Let me show you what the finished product is.  Because you can really have fun with this. 
[01:42:00]  That's so cute.  I put some of these frilly toothpicks, two eyes.  I had to do this in the car.  So it's not perfect.  I can be real creative with this.  And just have fun and pour some gravy on it.  Go crazy.  But what a fun way.  And again, instead of throwing the food away, stretching that food out,  and really making it work.  That food dollar.  Right.  Exactly.  Yes.  All right.  So how many?  That's a horrible-looking sandwich.  I had to do it in the car.  I'm going to do it at Barnes & Noble at 1 o'clock.  He's going to be signing copies of his new book.  Actually, I should say, I just checked my email before, 
[01:42:30]  and I might have to cancel the signing because the books have not arrived.  Oh, well, okay.  Never mind that.  Could I mention my charity real quick?  Sure.  Absolutely.  It's called The Leftovers Project.  We're asking, it's like a canned food drive, but with leftovers.  So you bring your leftovers for a week or less.  And we reheat them.  It's a participating Walmarts.  And just, we ask if you bring a couple of computers and you're losing it.  Sometimes they get legs and walk away.  That's a great idea.  So it's LeftoverProject.biz.  The book is called Leftovers Right and Make a Winner of Last Night's Dinner.  .biz. 
[01:43:00]  No one has the .biz.  Why would a charity register a .biz?  Is she even listening at this point?  He's asking people to bring their leftovers to Walmart.  To Walmart.  Participating Walmart.  He's smart to say participating Walmarts.  Oh, that's great.  Biz.biz.  .biz.  It's almost over this one.  Yeah, so it's LeftoverProject.biz.  The book is called Leftovers Right and Make a Winner of Last Night's Dinner.  Look for that at the bookstore.  Thanks for being here this morning. 
[01:43:30]  Thanks so much for having me.  We'll put more information on Fox6now.com.  There you have it.  Rob.  Yes.  You would enjoy this book.  He's got like 300 recipes on fun things for kids and what to do with leftovers.  I love that ant on a leg.  That is clever.  Right?  That's good stuff.  Anything to get the kids, especially my girls, to eat.  Eat real food.  Oh, God.  They're trying to shat up the segment a little, you know?  Eat real food as if the nutritional value in mashed potatoes in an ice cream cone. 
[01:44:00]  Show Jimmy the montage because the blunder.  That's fucking great.  So this is the guy that went on five different local.  Right.  My favorite line, by the way, was when he goes, I had to do this in the car.  Right.  The montage, because this is the video that's going everywhere.  We're playing it off Deadspin today.  Yeah, it's everywhere, and it's, you know.  It is funny, man.  It is a few days past Thanksgiving, but chances are good you probably still have a fridge full of all those leftovers. 
[01:44:30]  So this morning, you're in luck.  Chef Keith Gerke is here, author of Leftovers Rice, Making a Winner of Last Night's Dinner.  I'm self-taught.  I did not go to culinary school, and I'm kind of unorthodox.  People compare.  Are you familiar with G.G. Allen?  Do you know who he is?  He threw his own shit at the audience.  He shoved bananas up his ass and shitted out into the crowd.  Oh, I kick it off of the local news, getting hammered. 
[01:45:00]  G.G. Allen.  G.G. Allen.  This guy's brilliant.  He's the G.G. Allen of Leftovers.  Right.  In this montage clip, you're going to hear some of the stuff we just played, but it's okay, because it moves around.  Deal with it.  Yeah, just deal with it, please.  What do you think about that?  That's fun.  All right, you put a little scoop of gravy.  It can be room temperature, because your hand kind of warms up.  It's like a drumstick, almost, you know, like one of those frozen things.  So disgusting how it would soak into the cone.  There's this statistic that around the holidays, around Christmas, especially between Thanksgiving and Christmas, 
[01:45:30]  it's one of the highest suicide rates, and I think part of that is because of the stress of what are you going to do with these leftovers.  I recently went vegetarian, so some of the recipes in here aren't vegetarian, it's fine.  Okay.  For me, it's like part health reasons, but then also you read things like, the average person eats like a pound and a half of feces a year.  There's a Jewish croissant called a turkey.  I love it, because they're little asides. 
[01:46:00]  Like he says them in a way that the anchor or the news person doesn't really have to acknowledge them and discuss it, because it's just a quick aside.  And it's done under the guise of a legitimate kind.  Of course.  And he has so much else to tell you that he can't stop after saying that.  Right.  Point.  He's getting out some great lines, right?  And he's not rushing to get it, like he's not filling it up with lines.  No, no, no.  He's just sprinkling them in.  Sprinkling them back to the cooking.  Hugh, there's a Judas Priest song called A Turbo Lover. 
[01:46:30]  Well, I call this Turbo Gravy.  It's a spoof on that.  And it's basically taking gravy to the next level.  Why don't you give me a hand here?  This is what you do.  You're basically just going to put some of your ham in here.  Ham in the blender.  I want you to scoop a little bit of the pumpkin pie.  Try not to get the crust in too much.  And I'm going to put in a little extra corn.  Ham, green beans, corn.  In a blender.  In a blender.  Even if your mashed potatoes have butter, they're okay?  Yeah, it's fine.  Mashed potatoes in the blender.  And then add more gravy.  Oh, my gosh.  And it has to be already said he's a vegetarian, so he probably can't drink this. 
[01:47:00]  Right.  And he goes, she goes, is it okay if the mashed potatoes have butter on them?  And he goes, oh, it's fine.  It's all going to come out in the wash.  In the wash.  Oh, my God.  And then he just dumps a bunch of gravy in the blender with ham and green beans and corn.  This is fucking disgusting.  What a bad suggestion for leftovers.  Who would buy this?  The gravy.  Of course.  We need more gravy.  Of course. 
[01:47:30]  I'm using 2% for a heart healthy menu.  And then milk.  And, of course, don't forget your cranberry cherry.  You could use 2% for a heart healthy menu.  I always do a wrap.  That's kind of a...  That's easy.  Yeah, like it's like...  This guy's thanks to all the leftovers in the blender.  A beatbox?  He makes it do a beatbox.  It's time for cheer, but leftovers have you feeling fear.  Go to the fridge.  Take out the container.  You can make your leftovers even greater.  Wrap is great.  Wrap is great. 
[01:48:00]  Boom.  And this is like Jamba Juice, eat your heart out, right?  Just take a funnel that you get at a hardware store.  Jamba Juice, eat your heart out.  Eat your heart out.  Blending fucking meat leftovers.  He's making ham and pumpkin pie juice.  Eat your heart out.  It's Jamba Juice.  Why didn't we think of that?  Yeah.  Oh, damn.  Take a funnel that you get at a hardware store, put it in an old milk truck, and this will 
[01:48:30]  just put it in here, and you can put six meals or more in this milk truck.  Six meals.  That's going to take a long time to drain.  And this is so fun.  My daughter's spirit and Curtis Ann love these movies.  My daughter's spirit and Curtis Ann.  Just try a little bit of that.  But I can show you you have...  He made the news anchor drink.  All her daughter's names are Spirit and Curtis Ann.  And Curtis Ann.  It's fucking great. 
[01:49:00]  Try a little bit of that.  But I can show you you have a finished milk jug here.  Oh, my.  And the fat does go to the top.  So you've got to give it a good...  Come meet Chef Keith today.  You are going to be at Barnes & Noble at 1 o'clock.  He's going to be signing copies of his new book.  Actually, I should say, I just checked my email before.  What a great book cover he made.  It really looks authentic.  Okay, never mind then.  My daughter won't even try this stuff without the whipped cream.  Like, you're going to have whipped cream.  Look at her face. 
[01:49:30]  Look at the anchor's face.  He tips the whole table over.  We're going to throw things out to Mark for a check of our weather.  It's going to weather.  Please let me see.  Please let me see.  The fucking...  The table tipping.  It's so great.  He's trying to get whipped cream on it.  And he knocks the whole table over.  Oh, God.  I'm sorry.  Everything goes...  The blender, the fucking...  Everything falls over.  Sound footage fest.  This guy's great. 
[01:50:00]  Yes.  Look at the reporter's face, too.  Because she just had a drink of it.  Oh, she had some?  She's disgusting.  Oh, disgusting.  And he wants to put whipped cream on it.  And he knocks it.  He's falling over.  It's always funny.  Yeah.  Do you think he does that on purpose?  Oh, yeah.  That was...  Oh, he definitely did that on purpose.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Let me say it.  Without the whipped cream.  Like, you're going to have whipped cream left over, right?  I am so sorry.  He worked that leg.  Of course.  We're going to throw things out to Mark for a check of our weather. 
[01:50:30]  Sounds like some great recipes there to try out with your leftovers.  He's just trying to help her out.  That's really funny, man.  That is hilarious.  We'll tweet that out?  Yeah, we're tweeting that out.  And then do you also want to see the yo-yo master?  So, is this the same guy?  It's the same group.  I'm not...  Same group of guys?  It may be the same guy, but it's the same group, yeah.  Yeah, I haven't seen the yo-yo master yet.  Okay.  Oh, and a show on Twitter.  We'll tweet those videos out to you right now. 
[01:51:00]  All these videos are going on.  This is actually from 2010.  We just never played it.  Okay.  Welcome back to Good Morning Force.  And it's the same thing.  It's a local news show.  Yeah.  And this guy is on the show.  I think him...  Well, I don't know if it's the same guy or not.  But he's claiming to be a yo-yo master.  Right.  And so he's going to show the news show his yo-yo tricks.  His yo-yo skills.  Yeah.  States, it is finally Friday morning.  K-Stross is back with us again from ZipZap.  We thank you for joining us this morning. 
[01:51:30]  You've got your hands full of yo-yos right now.  You've got, what, four yo-yos per hand, right?  Right.  And what I do is, it's called the Blue Flying Angel.  Okay.  And it's like...  Do I need to get out of the way for this?  Yeah, you do.  He has a yellow hat and fucking suspenders.  You know, what we do, or I'll do is, the kids, I'll get into the room and the kids will  be running around and they'll be all excited.  And so I try to start things off on their level and try to hook them with something like  a wrap. 
[01:52:00]  Okay.  So it's, and it's kind of clever because it includes me.  Okay.  And it goes, hey, they're up in the sky.  It's the K-Stross, the yo-yo guy.  And then I do that.  Boo-dee-dee-ba-ba-ba.  Do-dee-dee-dee-ba-ba-ba.  Do-dee-dee-do-do.  Yo-yo-yo.  You know, and I get them going and I get them into it.  Okay.  And so once I do that, they are ready to learn.  Okay.  So you're ready to do the trick talk.  Absolutely.  I'm going to get out of the way here.  All right.  K-Stross, go ahead and take it away. 
[01:52:30]  And I usually have like a headpiece for this.  No, no, for effect.  Okay.  Because I act like I'm in a blue angel.  Okay.  So I say air traffic control.  We are ready for takeoff.  All right, 10-4, guys.  Let's roll.  Yo-yo-ing.  So you get that one going?  He's just spinning it in a circle, his right hand.  With the string.  Oops.  Lost one.  And he's spinning a bunch of them in a circle. 
[01:53:00]  They're not yo-yo-ing.  But if you just listen to it, he starts by swinging his other hand, and he drops one right away,  and he just goes, oops, lost one.  He just keeps going.  And now he's just spinning them on a string.  Right.  There's no yo-yoing.  Yeah, no yo-yo-ing.  It's the blue angel.  Well, he is the blue angel.  Yes.  Oops.  Lost one.  And then we're going, and we get worrying, and we're like, all right, everybody, let's 
[01:53:30]  take it down to the ground, and we'll get into a Huey.  And we get going.  Swinging them both over his head.  He's spinning her.  Everything's getting tangled.  And now he's just spinning them both again.  Over his head.  All right, everyone.  We're going to switch it off here.  And let's bring it back home for a clean landing.  10-4.  He falls on the ground.  He gets up.  What a terrible segment. 
[01:54:00]  That was horrible.  What a terrible.  What do you think that guy's thinking?  He's got to be standing there going, oh, my God, this segment is bombing.  Oh, no.  All the yo-yos are stuck together and stuck to his fingers.  He can't get them untangled.  And he whispers, what should I do?  What should I do?  Is that what he whispers?  Yes.  What should I do?  Listen.  He goes, what should I do?  Oh, that's brilliant.  Yes, you did.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen.  Listen again.  You okay? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, I got very dizzy.  Okay.  You want to continue where you're at?  Or can you do that?  Okay.  Because you've got all eight yo-yos in there.  Like a little kid.  You want to continue where you are.  And he starts aggressively shaking his head.  And then he shows his fingers to the guy.  And all the yo-yos are stuck together.  Wait.  Which guy said, what do you want to do?  The guy on the left.  The news guy.  Yeah.  What do you want to do? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  But actually, we've got seven now.  Honestly, I think I'm going to give up some of the yo-yo stuff because I don't have the muscle memory.  Okay.  Muscle memory.  Well, anyway.  But you do all the other schools.  Wow.  A pile of tangled yo-yos.  And what they do.  Like you said, this is actually for.  It's a non-profit.  It's a non-profit.  They're based in Minneapolis.  I met them at the Burlington Yo-Yo Championship in Wisconsin. 
[01:55:30]  Okay.  And they've just been sending me around.  And I've been in schools.  Tomorrow, I'm all the way down in Arkansas.  Okay.  Well, again, thank you for taking the time.  You were in Omaha yesterday.  So you've been on the road quite a bit.  And, of course, we'll put the information about ZipZap on our website.  And, of course, it's ZipZapllc.com, correct?  ZipZap.  ZipZap.  Yes.  ZipZapllc.com.  So, again, we'll put all that information on our website.  We're going to draw to find out who is going to be winning barbecue for Richard's Hog Wild. 
[01:56:00]  That's coming your way next time.  Good morning.  This sounds awful.  That's on Deadspin as well.  But we'll tweet that out.  We're tweeting it out, too.  All right, good.  Is he now, is this guy with the chef, or they just independently did this stuff?  No, they're all together.  Oh, they are.  I mean, this happened a couple years ago.  Okay.  But it's all part of, they organized this film festival together.  What a set of balls to do that, to carry through with it.  Just crash and burn on light TV like that.  Yes, oh, my God. 
[01:56:30]  You're just bombing.  Let's get the word out.  I want to talk to these guys.  Let's see if we can find them.  Yeah.  The yo-yo guy looks so sad.  Yeah, he definitely looks sad.  He wants to be good.  I think I'm going to give up some of the yo-yo stuff.  The Huey.  Now we'll do the Huey.  He lost his muscle memory.  Muscle memory.  For yo-yo-y.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Mm-hmm.  All right, join the Twitter account, O-N-A Show, please.  Oh, yeah.  All this visual crap, we tweet out the links immediately as we talk about them. 
[01:57:00]  All right?  Gotta love it.  Yeah.  And we'll be back.  I got a crazy travel story when we get back.  Uh-oh.  Fucking crazy what happened.  We'll be back with more Opie and Antibes.

From USA Network and executive producer Dennis Leary comes a new original comedy about three EMTs who are great at their job. 
[02:01:00]  No, you got a dead man here.  Not yet.  I mean, that's why we're here.  But not so great at everything else.  You still live with your parents.  No.  No.  They live upstairs.  I live downstairs.  Whole separate floor.  Sirens, a new original series, premieres this Thursday at 10, 9 central on USA Network.  Comedy's welcome.  Hey, you ever been conned by a contractor?  Yeah.  Every year, thousands of homeowners get ripped off by contractors doing shoddy work, which often leaves their homes in dangerous, unsafe states of disrepair. 
[02:01:30]  Now, Adam Carolla and Spike TV have teamed up to hammer home some justice with a new show on Spike called Catch a Contractor.  In the show, Adam searches out and brings these irresponsible contractors back to the families they've shafted to finish the job they started, this time doing it right.  He nails these guys where it hurts, using a private investigator on his team to hunt them down and confront them, hidden cameras and all.  The hacks have to work with Adam and his team to finish their project, or they end up in court. 
[02:02:00]  This is crazy.  You may be asking yourself, why is Adam Carolla involved in this kind of show?  Before comedy, Adam spent 10 years working construction and is actually a master carpenter.  How about that?  Catch a Contractor premieres Sunday, March 9th at 10 Eastern, 9 central, after an all-new episode of Bar Rescue.  Bar Rescue.  Only on Spike.

Call the Opie and Anthony show today.  Lady Di does.  Say what?  The Opie and Anthony show is back.  On Sirius XM.  Looks like we're going to get the fake chef on the phone. 
[02:08:00]  He wrote you back, Roland?  Very cool.  So stick around for that.  The videos we just played of the fake chef going on local news programs.  And bullshitting his way through some fine cooking segments. 
[02:08:30]  Any time the media could be made to look as stupid as they are.  Right.  I'm in.  By the way, TMZ picked up our Jim Ross, Vince McMahon sharting story video.  That's very important.  I want to thank TMZ for that.  That's pretty cool.  That's some team coverage.  Oh, yes there, Sam.  JR was happy that it made TMZ, too.  I got an email back from him.  Really? 
[02:09:00]  He said, that's some funny shit.  How was his gig?  It was good.  I mean, it was definitely for wrestling fans.  Yeah?  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, people really liked it?  Yeah, but everybody had a blast.  It got a little rowdy.  Oh, yeah?  Did CM Punk show up in Chicago last night?  No.  Oh, wow, so that's real.  Yeah.  Hometown.  What was it, Raw last night, I guess?  Yeah.  Monday Night Raw, yeah.  A lot of people were thinking maybe he would show up.  No, but they couldn't have any dead spots in the whole show.  Because every time there was any dead spots, the fans just started screaming CM Punk. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, really?  With a curse word, hopefully?  I mean, they tried.  Yeah.  But, you know.  I do like a good curse word chant when it's regular TV.  Yes.  It's a fucked up type of deal.  Oh, you fucked up is always good.  You fucked up is a great one.  She's got herpes.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  So, you want to do this next?  Wait, Jimmy has...  Oh, not Jimmy. 
[02:10:00]  No, don't.  What?  Oh, to travel?  You're not going to believe it if I tell you.  It's crazy.  What?  What happened?  Fucking Kenny's got to back me up because you won't believe this is true.  But I was...  I was traveling with...  Oh, fuck.  You're getting me near it.  I'm going to tell what happened when we were traveling.  How fucking crap.  I'm going through security, right?  And I got my bags and he got his.  And we're standing there, right?  And I get up to the fucking lady.  Yeah.  And I hand over my fucking boarding pass and driver's license. 
[02:10:30]  And she's looking at it and she's looking at me.  And she goes, just nothing for a second, right?  Yeah.  I got my bags and stuff ready for the plane.  All right.  He's got his bags all both ready for how to get through the aircraft.  Oh, my.  There's going to be storms.  This is the last chance we have.  And she looks at the boarding pass and she goes, this isn't you. 
[02:11:00]  And inside, I'm like, what the fuck?  I'm going through all these movies.  Like, maybe this is something got switched in the hotel.  And I'm like, ready for the plane.  And all of a sudden...  Fucking...  He handed me the wrong boarding pass.  If I had his, I had to give it back to him and get mine.  Back me up.  Back me up. 
[02:11:30]  That really happened.  Oh.  He's only telling you half the story.  Oh, my God.  Tell the other half.  No.  Well, you remember you woke up in the morning.  You got dressed.  Then we got in the car.  Fuck, yeah.  It was a long ride.  Drive to the airport.  Fuck, yeah.  I forgot about that.  Then you got out of the car.  That's right.  Got your luggage out of the trunk.  You remember I put the bags in the wrong water for a second?  Yeah, that was crazy.  Can't believe we made it back.  It was cold.  Fuck, yeah.  You know, we walked into the terminal. 
[02:12:00]  I made a mistake.  I gave you my boarding pass and had yours.  I knew you guys wouldn't believe it.  But then what about the other story with the luggage?  I don't know that one.  Oh, like it didn't fit?  It did.  I know.  Stop making stuff up.  Oh.  They said it wouldn't.  But it did.  Oh, fuck.  He ain't lying.  I said to the guy, will my luggage fit?  And he goes, no, it won't.  But I go, but did it fit on the way in? 
[02:12:30]  I told him.  And that cocksucker, it fit good.  It did.  Yeah.  Perfect.  Perfect.  Well, fuck him then, right?  They didn't want us to carry on.  Why?  I don't know.  They wanted us to gate check.  Yeah.  This is great.  So Fez had a meltdown last night.  Holy shit.  You don't think that was a good story?  Oh, God.  The worst story ever.  God.  It's like, oh, it just went on and on.  No payoff. 
[02:13:00]  So Fez had a meltdown on the last run of Fez Show, which was yesterday.  We got a few clips that have been brought to our attention.  That's right.  Ron and Fez, of course, noon on Raw Dog.  Right.  They're no longer with us on this here channel, but we still are very close to Ron Bennington.  Yes.  And the gang.  The Ron and Fez Show.  We're close with the Ron and Fez Show.  And Fez, you had a meltdown yesterday?  Yeah. 
[02:13:30]  Hmm.  Oh, boy.  What was it about?  Oh, well, I am the troublemaker.  I have nothing to do with it.  Who brought it to our attention?  Why is this?  Listeners?  Why is she suing her mom and dad?  She's a high school student.  That's the Facebook story?  Wow.  No.  That's a different one.  She got thrown out of the house by her parents, I guess, like two days before her birthday.  They're saying she left.  She's 18 now.  And they had paid her Catholic school tuition through the 31st of December.  And she's suing, saying they owe her for a new tuition.  She seems like a spoiled brat. 
[02:14:00]  And I hear the school is not going to penalize her if she doesn't have the tuition, like  they're going to let her go, like to the school.  Right.  But she's 18 now, so she's fucking, you're old enough to go to the military.  You're old enough to get booted.  Although I don't know if your parents are responsible for tuition until you're 21 if they don't want  to be.  No.  Of course not.  She needs a place to stay.  They're under Obama, aren't they?  No problem.  For tuition?  Hell no.  Oh, maybe not.  Rooms available.  I paid my house.  I paid every cent of my college.  They weren't responsible for anything.  No, no, but I mean, there's a new thing that I'm saying with Obama. 
[02:14:30]  No, I think what you're thinking about is...  No, that's the Obamacare.  Yeah, they can still be covered under your parents' health insurance.  Oh, you're right, right.  But not tuition.  Oh, my God.  I wish that was the case.  A lot of people would be happy out there.  A lot of us had to pay for our own skewling.  Skewling.  Yeah, there was no tuition in the School of Hard Knocks.  Hell no.  Yeah, you're not kidding.  You know what I paid?  Blood, sweat, and tears.  Did you?  You bet I did.  Regular Joe?  Yeah, you see these calluses?  That's my tuition. 
[02:15:00]  That's your tuition right there.  Hey, carry those bricks.  You got it.  That's my tuition.  Yeah, Miss Fancy wants everything paid for.  Yeah.  Get yourself a ham sandwich, get to work.  Ham sandwich.  Of course.  So, Ron and Fez.  Pain on milk.  Fezzy had some kind of meltdown.  About what?  Well, I guess he wasn't...  What was this one about?  Oh, shit.  I guess he was told to stay away from a guest we had here yesterday for a town hall.  Who was here yesterday?  I think Seth MacFarlane.  Oh, Seth MacFarlane. 
[02:15:30]  What time did he come?  It was in the afternoon.  Okay.  No, he's boring.  I was saying yesterday, I tweeted...  We had him on the phone.  He was boring.  I tweeted that whoever taught him about repetition comedy should literally be shot in the face.  For who?  Seth MacFarlane.  Why?  You're not a fan of that?  They just fucking...  I haven't heard this one yet.  Oh, God.  What?  What?  Go ahead.  That's like the time. 
[02:16:00]  One time.  One time.  That reminds me of the time.  Oh, God.  That Family Guy is un-fucking-watchable.  No, but they're quick with it, though.  Oh, right.  That's just it.  They're quick with it, aren't they?  There was a...  Yesterday, one was on.  It comes on right after Seinfeld.  I actually watch...  Sorry.  I actually now watch Family Guy again.  I used to love Family Guy.  I can't make believe I didn't.  But like you, it got old for me.  But now that you've done this bit on our show, I now watch again, just waiting for that 
[02:16:30]  moment.  It's that moment, and then the one where they just repeat the same word over and over.  Right.  Because like there's a bit going on.  But then the cartoon eyes, like, you know, they move around a lot.  That makes it fun.  Doesn't that make it fun?  No.  I'm trying to remember what it was yesterday.  Seinfeld comes on, and then Family Guy comes on.  Please remember so we can find the clip.  By the time I'm doing something, and then I look up just ready to throw something at the  television, because it's the same word being repeated 50 fucking times. 
[02:17:00]  Cool whip.  Oh.  Yeah, that was one of the famous ones.  So Fez, he lost his mind yesterday.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  So I guess it was a Monday yesterday, right?  What's wrong with him?  What's so hard?  Apparently, he doesn't feel like management respects him.  Uh-oh.  They don't respect any of us.  Well, that's a good point right there.  They do not respect anyone that works here. 
[02:17:30]  Well, respect!  You want respect?  I disagree.  I think they're particularly big fans of our show.  We've heard that they love the show.  They love that.  All right.  Why would they lie?  Maybe it's time to show it a little bit.  Why would they lie?  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  So Fez thinks management doesn't respect him or something like that.  Something to that effect.  He walked around as Hitler.  Yeah.  Exactly.  At least you know Anthony respects him.  Does he understand he might have brought a little of this on to himself? 
[02:18:00]  What were some of the other things he's done in recent memory?  Well...  Which is great for a radio show, but when you've got suits walking around,  your stock in respectability is going to drop.  It goes down a little.  It could, yeah.  He did walk around as Hitler.  Yeah.  He dyed his mustache like a rainbow.  Right.  He wore a wig for no particular reason for about six to eight months.  Right.  Even though he had a full head of hair.  It's great.  Come on. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  And he did it all off the air as well as on the air.  Right.  So he would spend his days walking around the halls like with a wig on.  Yeah, yeah.  With his Hitler mustache.  I mean, he literally came in to the opiate, to this show.  Yes.  Right.  Dressed as Hitler and talking like Hitler.  It's terrible.  Hitler did so many negative things.  And this business is run by the jazz.  So not the best thing to do.  Maybe not. 
[02:19:00]  Well, a lot of jazz in this business.  So do we have clips of Fez losing it yesterday?  Yes.  What was this about?  Seth MacFarlane?  Yes.  Does he need a setup?  I guess he couldn't.  I don't really know because Iraq cut the first clip.  But the setup is, to my understanding, because I didn't hear the very beginning, he couldn't go near Seth MacFarlane yesterday because they thought he might harass him or something.  I don't really know.  And this is due to some previous thing.  What is this based on?  That I guess he's gone up to guests in the past.  Right.  And some people have not liked his behavior. 
[02:19:30]  Why?  Isn't he just trying to book him for Ron's show?  Yeah, I think that's what he's trying to do.  Right.  But I don't think that they like things done by protocol, right?  So they don't want just random personnel here approaching guests.  They think he's crazy, right?  Well, okay.  We were talking about the weight for no reason.  I think they think he's crazy and they're a little worried about his approach.  Yeah, they probably don't.  Yeah, they definitely wouldn't trust Fez to be in the talent department because the talent department specializes in dealing with talent. 
[02:20:00]  You think he eats babies?  Fez?  Oh, wow.  I've never seen him eat, so I don't know for sure one way or the other.  He doesn't eat in front of people?  Not in front of me, so he could be eating babies.  All right.  So why don't we play this clip here?  Why are you mad?  Is it, let me guess, is it Shelby?  Is it Chris?  Is it Vito?  Who made you mad today, Fez?  Oh, it's people down the hallway again. 
[02:20:30]  I was asked not to mention any names, but got an email from Don Wicklin.  Well, you just mentioned the name.  Oh, no, this is who passed it along to me.  Got an email from Wicklin.  Got a phone call from Wicklin.  And I'm more than a little upset that I have been told to stay away from the fishbowl later on today.  Keep away, don't go down there, I guess, doing my lurking thing.  Well, I think that's nice that you heard that from Wicklin in advance this time. 
[02:21:00]  No, it just means someone else is talking about me down the hallway again.  Chris?  Do you think it's Chris?  No, I know it's not Chris.  Shelby?  Vito?  Who is it?  No, it's not any of them.  I'm not going to mention this person's name, but...  Is it me?  Apparently, I'm such a plague in this building that certain areas need to be Fez quarantined.  Do you see this as anti-gay?  I totally see it as anti-gay. 
[02:21:30]  What?  Yeah.  Don't let the gay guy go near the fishbowl later on today.  He might put it on his head.  Oh, my God.  Why does everything have to be gay?  I've asked myself the same question in the mirror many times.  Why is it a gay thing?  God, enough.  No, I would say that the odds of him being an anti-gay thing are zero.  Right.  They just don't want him near big A-list guests. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, I guess he lingers.  I don't know.  I've never seen him do it.  Maybe some would say he makes guests uncomfortable.  Has he made a guest uncomfortable?  I don't know.  I don't work in a department.  Don doesn't just send out emails willy-nilly.  Why else would he say that?  Unless that person is making someone uncomfortable.  Why else do you tell him to stay away?  It could just be the talent department.  It might not be a guest, per se.  That's true.  I think the talent department doesn't want radio personalities approaching the guests. 
[02:22:30]  Which makes sense.  Because there are a lot of them in this building, and it would be a little overwhelming.  That's what I'm thinking.  Imagine if every host just went up to the guest and said, why don't you do my show?  There has to be a protocol.  Imagine if every show just opened the door when they saw a guest and said, yo, and said  their name with some kind of familiarity.  That would be crazy.  Look who we've gotten in over the years because of that. 
[02:23:00]  A little tactic.  That's true.  All right.  Does this continue?  Because this is boring so far.  You don't like it.  It's boring.  This clip is going to turn you around.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Email and a phone call because the email wasn't enough.  That somebody's down the hallway going to Wiki, running their cake horn, tooting that, right  at Wiki, so that I'm told to stay away from the fishbowl.  All right.  I just want to get one.  It drives me fucking nuts.  Well, rather than fucking talk over me, can we stop for a second? 
[02:23:30]  I'm upset.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  How does someone run their cake horn?  What?  Is that fucking impossible?  Cake horn.  That's not real.  It's a cake horn.  By that, you mean their mouth?  Yes, I mean their mouth.  Of course I mean their mouth.  That's a fucking cake hole, not a cake horn.  You either say to someone, fucking shut your horn or you shut your cake hole.  But there's no such thing as a cake horn. 
[02:24:00]  In this case, I think it applies.  A cake goes in one side and the noise comes out the other.  You fucked up.  Cake horn.  People are talking about me.  But look, I'm not out of their cake horns.  It's not about the cake horn, Chris.  It is about the fucking cake horn.  It's crazy.  It's not about the cake horn.  It's about somebody talking shit about me again.  Here's the, you know why it's not about the...  Don't focus on that! 
[02:24:30]  But do you know why it's not about the cake horn?  Because there's no fucking such thing as a cake horn.  This thing's been derailed by the cake horn.  It doesn't exist.  Try to forget the fact, Chris.  Um, excuse me.  Is this the bakery?  I'd like to order a cake horn.  What do you mean it's not a real thing?  Isn't it a horn made out of cake?  Or is it?  What do you think?  It's a horn filled with cake.  I think it's a horn filled with cake.  There is no such thing as a cake horn. 
[02:25:00]  Know that.  It's cake whole.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That's fucking funny.  And then those guys got cake horn trending all over the place yesterday on Twitter, right?  Cake horn.  Cake horn.  Yeah.  Became the number one trending topic in the United States yesterday.  Nice.  Nice.  It's, it just completely stopped the argument, the discussion they were having.  Did you just say cake horn?  That's all it takes.  All of a sudden, discussion over cake horn. 
[02:25:30]  Was that the sound of a cake horn you just made?  Yes, cake horn.  Not according to Fez.  No?  No.  Anyway, you were saying something before I went and laughed at you for saying cake horn.  And I really do want to get to the part that there was some gay bashing that took place by Wiki?  No, Wiki was just passing it along.  Okay, I thought he was gay bashing.  So, he passed along the, I guess, gay warning of no gays allowed near the fishbowl at four o'clock today. 
[02:26:00]  That's a bit, right?  Is that a bit?  Well, then stay out of there.  This is a fucking perfect chance for you to go, oh, I'm going to stop being a fucking pain in the ass and be cool.  Oh, you won't see me near that place.  Okay.  So, what's the problem?  That's a good thing.  Yeah.  You finally fucking learned your lesson.  No, what I'll do is, since the bathroom's right across from the fishbowl, I guess I'll just piss in a bucket in the studio if I need to. 
[02:26:30]  Is this a bit?  I don't know.  You never know.  The gay thing.  Is that a bit?  No, he's gay.  No, he's gay.  No, he's gay.  He finally admitted that.  But, I mean, the whole gay bashing thing, he really thinks that's happening?  He seems very upset.  It doesn't sound like a bit to me.  He thinks that they're banning gay people from the fishbowl.  Also, he thinks people should shut their cake horns.  Their cake horn.  He doesn't. 
[02:27:00]  And we finally have one more clip.  Cake horn.  One more clip from the big Fez meltdown from yesterday.  Hey, Hard Rock Johnny.  How you doing, buddy?  Hey, happy Mardi Gras, everybody.  If you get a baby in your cake horn, you've got to buy the next cake horn next year.  See, you want a baby in your mouth, you fucking sicko.  Oh, Johnny!  You were so fucking mad at him.  We've never gotten mad at Johnny.  That's our buddy.  Yeah, I'm fucking...  Johnny should fucking know better.  Johnny, I expect to be a friend and back me up. 
[02:27:30]  Chris, he's not a friend.  Shelby's not a fucking friend.  No.  So why would I even fucking expect them to back me up on one fucking thing around here?  Is this about the cake horn thing?  No, it's about what happened to me over the weekend, what happened...  What are you smiling about, Vito?  I didn't do anything.  Get the fuck out of the room.  Well, wait, Vito.  Were you smiling about cake horn?  I didn't know.  I don't even know what's happening.  Sitting there with a big shit-eating grin on his face.  Get the fuck out of here.  I didn't even do anything. 
[02:28:00]  I just laughed at cake horn.  Everybody was laughing at cake horn.  Get the fuck out of here.  Wait, one more thing.  Were you laughing about the cake horn thing?  Yeah, I thought cake horn was funny.  Everybody was laughing at cake horn.  I don't know why I'm getting singled out now.  You're a fucking intern.  You want to get singled right out the fucking door?  That's like bullying.  I don't think it's bullying.  I think it's addressing an intern who's fucking back-talking me.  I just laughed at cake.  He asked me a question, and I answered it.  Who's he?  Chris?  No one was saying anything to you. 
[02:28:30]  Ron literally said me laughing at me.  You're getting pissed, and you're sitting there with a big giant fucking grin on your face.  Like you fucking dumb-witted asshole.  This is really embarrassing, because we didn't even promote this, but cake horn is trending on Twitter.  Oh, yes.  Okay, cool.  All right, right now cake horn is number four in the whole country, and we didn't even promote it on the show.  That rules.  I love it.  Oh, is that fucking great?  Vito is their intern.  Yeah, yeah.  It sounded like he was crying.  I love that. 
[02:29:00]  I was laughing at cake horn.  Everybody was laughing at cake horn.  It sounded like an extra from The Sopranos.  Oh, hey, come on.  And a little text update from Wiki, who we were mentioning in this clip.  Very proud.  Number one trend yesterday.  Hashtag cake horn.  Cake horn.  All right.  Wiki's loving it.  We could trend something right now if we had to.  Can we retrend cake horn?  We could do that. 
[02:29:30]  Cake horn.  We could have that trend again.  Pop back up.  Pop it back up.  Wow, Fezzy.  Man, glad things have changed over there.  Yeah.  For the better.  That's, uh...  What happened to the big change that was happening in his head?  Well, they wouldn't let him near the fishbowl.  And he said everything was good now.  He was a good person, remember?  But if they're gay bashing, they're gay bashing.  What can he do about that?  Gay bashing?  Yeah, they're gay bashing. 
[02:30:00]  Why is...  Why?  I don't...  You know, I just don't understand why it's considered gay bashing.  Because they don't want Fez to harass the guests.  So it has to be because he's gay.  Right.  That's the logic in his head.  All right.  And we're trying to figure out...  Cake horn.  Oh, boy.  The worst thing is when you really want to...  Regardless how valid it is or not.  Right.  When you want to make a point, you're arguing a point.  You say something that just blows up the argument. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  It turns it into something else that they're goofing on.  Oh, how frustrating is that?  Yeah, because even if he got back to his point, even if it was a valid point...  Cake horn.  It's all about cake horn at that point.  Right, because the minute that the guy you're arguing with knows that you're winning, he can just be like...  Wait, didn't you say cake horn a minute ago?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And these clips were condensed.  This was 45 minutes of cake horn.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  They just pounded the cake horn.  They just kept going, huh? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Good for them.  All right.  I love it.  So that happened yesterday, which is nice.  Not the bad of bad stuff.  Raw dog, right?  Noon?  Yeah, raw dog at noon, which is SiriusXM99.  That sucks they're at noon.  I'm still driving.  I don't get to listen.  Yeah, why do they start at noon?  Probably for nine on the West Coast, I'm guessing, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a weird time, nine o'clock on the West Coast.  I get, like, three minutes of Sam Roberts when I'm driving home. 
[02:31:30]  Which is half the show.  That's cool.  Three minutes, half the show.  What do they have on in the morning on Raw Dog?  They have nothing.  They just do comedy bits.  So why are they throwing them on at noon?  I don't know.  I mean, all they have at noon to three and the rest of the channel is comedy bits.  That's bad programming.  I wonder if they're trying to get the Raw Dog audience, they're worried, won't be responsive  to a regular show instead of clips.  Maybe they're trying to ease into it.  I don't know.  The Raw Dog audience, I mean, maybe they were worried about that in the beginning, but  they've been super responsive to Ron and Fest. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, good.  They move them down.  Ron and Fest could easily be doing any spot on that channel.  They keep moving them down.  Yeah, they get a bigger audience the more you move them down.  Only so many times you could listen to, you know, the old bits.  Yeah.  The old comic shtick.  They have comedians on every day now.  Yeah.  What do they got today?  I don't know who's coming in today.  Dan Soderon recently.  Way to do your research.  I'm not booking for the Ron and Fest show.  Way to do your research on that one.  You know, you should probably have a little sheet in front of it. 
[02:32:30]  How's the...  Oh, you want Denny in here?  No.  To show Sam how it's done?  Not really.  You sure?  Positive.  We haven't had a mom in a while, though.  Yes, we have.  Denny came to me with a suggestion.  He said St. Paddy's Day is right around the corner.  That's true.  If the guys want a little St. Patrick's Day music on St. Patrick's Day, it's Monday.  Oh, boy.  He'd be happy to come in and DJ the party.  What are we going to get?  I think we have to do that. 
[02:33:00]  Just have him in the corner and take this in there.  And various Irish artists.  With his stupid DJ voice.  I love his DJ voice.  You do?  It's great.  Yes.  Yeah.  We better have him in, I'm thinking, to make sure this is set up proper.  St. Paddy's Day.  Right now?  Yeah, I think so.  All right, let me, yeah, you're right.  I remember the last time we did an appearance for St. Paddy's Day.  That was fun.  At the bar.  Yeah.  What bar was that? 
[02:33:30]  And fucking all.  It was close to here.  That was the time where Marissa got all drunk and I drove her home and she threw up all  over the side of my Escalade.  Right, right, right, yep.  She threw up out the window and it just was this racing stripe of vomit down the side of  the Escalade.  The whole side of the Escalade.  Yeah.  And then I had to listen to her drunken rambling as she sat on the sidewalk in front of my house  while I hosed down my vehicle.  Oh, my God.  It was great.  It was a good time.  Good times.  Oh, good times. 
[02:34:00]  Well, Jimmy's boys are infighting.  Kiss.  What happened?  Yeah, Paul has a new book coming out, too.  Hey, Paul.  Well, they read the other books and I'm sure they weren't happy about it.  So now Paul Stanley's going to set the record straight on a few things, I'm sure.  Yeah, what did he say about Ace?  He said that his skills threw away incredible potential is the big headline.  Wow.  The bitterness between the current and former members who found a kiss will not be quelled 
[02:34:30]  anytime soon.  It's been a little over a week since the group announced that it would not perform in any  lineup at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony.  That's just, that's just, they can't figure that out, really?  I literally think that certain things were said that the band members find unforgivable.  That's my guess.  Following Ace Freely's comment that he would not perform with current guitarist Tommy Thayer  wearing Freely's sometime makeup.  Now in a new interview with Guitar World, vocalist, guitarist Paul Stanley has derided  Freely's talent. 
[02:35:00]  What we had at the beginning was magical.  Ace and I played great together, Stanley said, but in my mind it's a crime what Ace did.  He threw away incredible potential and talent.  The Ace I played with when the band first started out was a Comet and not...  And not Freely's Comet, because that was his late 80s band.  He wasn't a reference.  Okay.  But he was burning bright and really had the ability, and this would rub him the wrong  way to be a real contender.  But he stopped practicing. 
[02:35:30]  He got involved with a whole lot of things that really diluted and diminished his craft.  I saw that Comet grow dim.  Yeah, but he had a great run.  Yeah.  As far as a rock star, he had a great run.  Yeah.  I think he's just saying that he probably thought Ace could have played a lot better for a lot  longer.  Right.  But he was there for a long time, right?  No, he left Kiss in, it was 79 or 80.  And Peter Criss got booted in 80.  And then when did those guys come back? 
[02:36:00]  Me and Jeff Ross went to see them in Philly, and I think that was 96.  That was the first reunion, I think.  And then they did it in like 2000.  They were gone that long?  Oh yeah, at least.  At least 15 years.  God, you forget now.  And Paul says it was a mistake to take the makeup off, too.  He thinks that was a mistake.  I don't know if it was a mistake, though.  I don't know.  I don't know, because it had kind of run its course at one point.  And in hindsight, it's easy to go.  It was a mistake.  But the band put out some decent stuff in that era.  Well, if it was a mistake, they had to change it up a little bit.  Yeah, to compete in the 80s or whatever. 
[02:36:30]  Remember when Metallica cut their hair?  Right.  The outrage?  Like, what the hell are they doing?  Haters.  And I don't blame Ace for not wanting to play with Tommy.  Like, not to, you know, because it's like, they're inducting Gene, Paul, Ace, and Peter.  Like, that's who the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is inducting.  Is acknowledging, as far as the band goes, right?  Yeah.  When they inducted Sabbath, it was Ozzy, Tony, Geezer, and Bill.  It was not Ronnie Dio or Vinnie and Peace.  What about the other guys?  Do they get something for that as well?  John St. John or Vinnie Vincent?  Do they get something official for being inducted into the Hall of Fame? 
[02:37:00]  I think that's up to the band.  Eric Carr, who died.  I think that's up to the band.  Stanley also said that after Kiss ousted drummer Peter Criss in 1980, he decided the band needed  to reinvent itself, and that's why they removed their makeup in 1983.  It's a decision he now feels hurt the band.  83, that was?  Yeah.  Rather than saying we built these iconic figures together and we're going to continue on with  what we built, we bought into the idea of we have to have a new character, he said.  That wore it down.  Some people may argue with me, but I feel that Batman is Batman, whether he's played by George 
[02:37:30]  Clooney, Christian Bale, Val Kilmer, and on and on.  The problem is their music wasn't that great.  If their music was great, no one would have gave a shit that they didn't have makeup on  during that time period.  You know, I think the thing he's looking at, but it's easy with hindsight, is he's saying  the characters like Paul with the star and Gene with his and Ace and Peter, you're looking  back at that and going, well, these characters that we created, we should have just put other  guys into that place.  But that's 20 years after the fact. 
[02:38:00]  In that moment, you don't know that your original stuff is going to be the fucking stuff that  people remembered the most 15 years down the road.  You don't have the ability to see that.  Of course.  So it's an easy decision to look at in hindsight.  But maybe if they had left the makeup on, people would have went like, oh, this is lame,  it's different people, and then totally lost interest by 87.  What was their best song when they didn't have makeup on?  They had some big ones, Lick It Up, Heaven's on Fire.  Lick It Up and Get Up.  That was during that period?  Yes.  Wow. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, yeah.  They had a couple of big...  Well, there goes my theory, because that was a huge song for Kiss.  They had some really big ones, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  I prefer the pre...  I think also, though, people say, like, the show kings, that's the way it is with music.  I remember my memories from Kiss were all like, my fuck, they were my first idols,  and the first 10 years I really listened to music was all Kiss.  Aw.  Yes.  Jimmy listening to Kiss.  Yes, I was.  And I cried when me and my Uncle Mike argued about it.  What?  Because he didn't like Kiss, so I cried.  Did you really? 
[02:39:00]  Yes.  Aw.  I'm laughing at you.  I was in tears my entire childhood.  Why didn't he like Kiss?  I don't know.  He probably liked the other ones.  Like, my aunt and Carrie and Uncle Mike liked Pink Floyd.  Like, they were a couple years older than me only.  Yeah.  Some stoners.  Frampton, like that type of stuff.  This is crazy kid music.  Yeah.  But most of these bands end up hating each other.  But they get it together just to get into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and then they move  on to hating each other, I guess.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Why fucking ruin that moment?  Yeah.  You know, it's only, it's going to be this quick thing.  Do it the right way, and then, you know, deal with each other for the day, whatever, and 
[02:39:30]  then you move on.  I'm thinking that they feel like they got Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer in place for  a while now, and that's the band they're touring with, and it looks like the original  band as much as it can.  And now maybe they're afraid if they put the real, you know, the original Ace and Peter  out there, then people are going to once again go right back to square one with the  comparisons and go, what the fuck?  Why is this band not touring?  What do you got?  Like, they deal with that enough, so they might just be like, why would we want to start  that shitstorm all over again?  I got to tell you, we've interviewed all of them, and Ace and Peter were, 
[02:40:00]  way cooler than Gene and Paul.  Paul was kind of cool, too.  Yeah, and Gene gave us really good radio.  Gene gave us good radio, but he's a fucking dick.  But Ace and Peter were just really just cool guys.  They knew how to hang, you know what I mean?  They were just here, just hanging.  No real agenda.  The tendency, and I feel this happened with Sabbath, too, is whenever there's an ousted member  of the band, like, a lot of the fans side immediately with that member. 
[02:40:30]  Like, you know, how the fuck could you?  Like, and at times that's right, but the more you read into it, it's like, eh, there are  two ways to look at it.  And there were some things said in the Ace's and Peter's books that might have made Gene  and Paul go, like, fucking, you know what?  I mean, again.  Right.  And then Ace and Peter would go, hey, we were just telling the truth.  Right.  I would assume they were just telling the truth.  Yeah.  And Paul and Gene may know they were telling the truth, but just go, like, fuck this.  The fact that you said that was unnecessary.  I don't know.  Danny, I forgot why we're winding in here. 
[02:41:00]  You can leave.  Hello.  Oh, no.  You want to do a St. Paddy's Day thing for him?  I thought about it.  Yeah.  Kicked it around.  We could maybe get, you know, some Irish music throughout the day.  Irish artists.  Green bagels.  Green beer.  I'm sure Roland could, you know, get some Irish food in here.  We could have correspondents at the parade giving updates about what's going on.  How's the crowd building?  Prepping the entire show.  What do you mean building?  Well, because people start coming in because it's on a Monday. 
[02:41:30]  Right.  So that becomes a three-day weekend.  And I think they have the Irish pub crawl on Saturday.  Oh, look at that.  And then the fucking parade.  We could have correspondents all throughout the weekend.  Is that how you do it on regular radio?  Well, I just think it's fun.  Regular radio or satellite radio.  We'll put the fun into it.  No.  No.  No.  We'll put the fun into it.  People will have fun on St. Paddy's Day.  But the radio part is not fun.  I think we'll have fun.  We'll make sure we have fun. 
[02:42:00]  What are some of the St. Paddy's Day songs you're going to play on Monday for us?  Well, I have a whole collection on the hard drive of hits.  We have a McNamara's band.  We could come in and out of the stop sets with Irish music.  And, you know.  I like it.  I call myself Dennis O. Falcone that day.  Oh.  Yeah.  Anthony Okumia.  Right.  I get it.  I get the whole gist.  I think, you know.  And if anybody happens to know anybody who has an Irish bar, we can have them call in.  You know, from around the country.  Hey, what's going on? 
[02:42:30]  Say what is wrong?  You know, we're kind of.  Maybe they have some acts there.  Jimmy O. Norton is not liking this.  What are they going to say?  We could get some big pipers in.  Yeah, it's crazy down here.  Everybody's drinking.  Yep.  Gives a shit.  The green beer's a-floor one.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's cool.  Same break that people did in 1981.  Maybe we could have some pipers come in.  Oh, nothing better than bagpipes.  I think that's great.  Exactly.  Like a civil servant funeral.  That's the way they do it.  I love it when I DJ a wedding of a police officer and they have the pipers come in. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, yeah.  That is just.  Oh, yeah.  You actually love it.  Yeah, it's fun.  It's just great.  Yeah.  Everybody gets into it.  Everybody gets into it.  How do you get into it?  It's fun.  It's not fun.  Everybody's Irish that day.  That day.  Everyone's Irish that day.  Everyone's Irish that day.  Yeah, we could play some Irish artists that day.  Van Morrison.  You too.  And that's about it.  Okay.  No, no.  We'll come up with some more.  Sinead.  Maybe there's some Pogues.  Oh, Pogues.  Pogues. 
[02:43:30]  Pogues.  Yeah, there you go.  Yeah.  We could do some of that.  Sounds like a party in the making right there.  Let's kick it around.  Maybe after the after show meeting.  I'm not sure what time you guys are cutting out.  Yeah, well, we could go over that.  You know, go over that.  Right.  Kick that around.  I think Tim would like that.  Oh, yeah.  What do you think?  You think Todd's going to reinvent regular radio like he's saying to everybody?  I think he's in a...  Not Todd.  I don't think Todd's going to do anything.  Uh-huh.  But I think Scott is in a place where he belongs.  He sounds good there.  He does.  And that's where he should be. 
[02:44:00]  He's in his element.  Professional assessment right there.  Sure.  Yeah.  So it's fun.  And you guys gave him a heck of a lot of publicity.  Well, we try.  Yeah.  And he was very appreciative, too.  Got to help him out.  He sounded great on the show.  Oh, he did.  It was really some fun radio.  You must have been jerking off in the back.  I ran a couple of...  I was going to say Jimmy, but Jimmy wasn't here that day.  Me and Ann talking to Scott Shannon.  That had to be a wet dream for you.  That was fantastic, yeah.  Yeah.  I ran some air checks on cassette back at the office.  Did you?  You're going to trade those? 
[02:44:30]  Actually, I was listening yesterday when he...  With all the radio geeks from around the country?  I was on the train coming in, and nobody was air checking him on the train as I was riding  in yesterday morning.  I mean, I had a little portable cassette machine on my lap, my little Walkman, plugged into  the radio, just, you know, getting that.  Because you want that for radio history.  Oh, you sure do.  You sure do.  You're going to need stuff like that.  Why would you record someone doing just a basic show?  On cassette.  On cassette.  It just has that warmth.  The analog just has that warmth at the radio. 
[02:45:00]  Ah, the warmth.  Oh, it doesn't.  Yeah, it does, man.  It's no different.  Imagine Married to Analog.  It's the most fucking overrated thing ever.  I like the way it sounds on the record.  It's no different.  I still have all my Kiss on vinyl on the albums.  They're all collecting it, if you like.  But, I mean, this...  Because people think they're being more real about the music when they feel about it that  way.  Right.  Like, whenever they're like, yeah, it sucks walking around with it on your iPod.  Terrible.  Yeah, yeah.  I'd rather listen to it when I get home on a record and just sit there on the couch and look 
[02:45:30]  at the speaker.  Yeah, and don't forget, you can't move or the...  Right.  No, not at all.  The record will skip.  Don't get up too fast.  Drop a marshmallow.  It's like...  I remember being in a shitty apartment and the floors would bounce a little bit and that  would fuck up our music playing there.  Dennis, you know this is old school shit, right?  Years ago, back when you would DJ in nightclubs, you used to have the 1,200 turntables made  by Technique.  Because they had a little bounce to them.  No, you used to put them on big rubber bands or bungee cords so they would bounce.  They would have a little bounce on there.  I would put some heaviness on top of that needle, too. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, that wears away the record.  I understand, but you have no choice.  Some radio stations, we'd have to put like a nickel or a quarter on the arm of the turntable,  so it wouldn't skip.  I want to just take one phone call here.  John in Florida wants in.  John?  How is this piece of shit not fired from serious radio?  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Oh, John.  Every time I hear his voice, I just want to just bash his face in with a baseball bat.  Which one of us do you mean? 
[02:46:30]  I'm not you, Jimmy.  We love you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  But old Demi O retard.  Oh, now.  Yeah, they don't like you, Dennis.  What do you have to say to your haters?  Hey, it's a free world.  They can think whatever they want.  You know, if you're going to be in this business, you've got to be able to take it both ways.  You just can't take the...  Thick skin, right?  Yeah.  That's all right.  Yeah, sure.  Some of them say, Jimmy doesn't know what he's talking about.  Mark in Chicago.  I know.  It's probably a guy who likes the way it sounds on record.  Go ahead, Mark.  Oh, yeah.  I got nice equipment.  You probably have shit gear.  For as big of a music fan as you say you are, you should go out and there's plenty of 
[02:47:00]  hi-fi shops.  I have zero desire for...  Who are you fucking...  Who are you buying it from?  Don Sheetle at the end of Boogie Nights?  You do it at Buck's fucking music store?  I have no desire.  I would imagine most people that are buying that over-the-top hi-fi stuff, they don't  even know the difference.  Listen to that bass.  They just make believe.  It sounds hip and smart.  Right, of course.  I would assume a very small percentage of people really, truly appreciate doing that shit.  An iPod sounds great. 
[02:47:30]  We all have the same ears.  That's what I'm saying.  I have the same ability to judge music you do because of my ears.  Yeah, but you've never heard anything high quality.  Sure I have.  I'm 45 years old.  You think I've never heard a record on a good fucking system?  Never.  Never.  Can you say there's no difference?  Dude, no.  No.  No.  No difference.  There's a $2,000 prostitute and a $50 prostitute?  No, the system.  See, that's bullshit what you're saying because the system, if you have a good system, that 
[02:48:00]  doesn't matter if you're playing digital music on.  It still sounds great.  A record, I'm sure, would sound great.  It still sounds great, too.  What's that?  It can sound great.  Analog can sound great.  But enough with analog.  It's fucking you sitting there in your house listening to it.  Shut up.  Put the record on.  Wash it.  Most of these hipster kids have shitty equipment and have no idea.  All right, what are you actually hearing?  I mean, turn us on to this because obviously we don't get it.  Well, it's kind of like being in a recording studio.  I used to do a lot of internships there, and records, when they sound recorded, they sound 
[02:48:30]  completely different than what it sounds like over the radio.  It's crazy.  It's like having an artist perform for you in front of you when you close your eyes.  Dude, a good system is a good system.  Like, if I'm listening to my iPod and I have a really good system, it's going to sound  great.  If you have a record on a really good system, it's going to sound great.  True.  But I'm not talking about taking a shitty system and comparing it to a good system.  I'm saying I'm sick of records and there's fucking people who think that they're really  in touch with the music more because they like the record. 
[02:49:00]  Like, wow, you really go deep, dude.  You're old school.  I like an occasional pop and hiss.  Yeah, all right.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  I agree with you there.  Thank you.  Love you, boys.  All right, buddy.  Bye, mister.  We have one more, Jimmy, that you have to deal with here.  Jay in Tampa.  Jay.  What's going on, my boy?  Hey.  Okay.  Hi, Jay.  I agree with you, Jimmy.  When it comes to the actual final product, between the, you know, MP3, you can obviously 
[02:49:30]  hear the difference.  But between a CD and a record, most people will never notice a difference.  Now, what I do disagree with you is when you're recording.  If you record in a studio, direct, digital, which most studios do nowadays, you can hear  a huge difference if you go to analog first before going into, like, Pro Tools.  I don't, um, I've never been in a studio and heard that, so maybe you're right.  I can't say you're wrong, because I don't know the difference, like, from being in a  studio.  I mean, and most of the crap is so over-compressed nowadays anyway, even the hipsters listening 
[02:50:00]  in on their damn circuit tables aren't going to be able to hear the difference, because  they're not here in the full headroom of the recording anyway.  Hey, dude, and I'm not shitting on analog.  I'm only saying that people who are talking so much about records like it's this much  better thing than a fucking listen to it.  It sounds great when you put on those headphones and you're walking around.  It sounds phenomenal.  I've heard every Sabbath album and Kiss album in every form they've come in.  I hear no difference.  I like the ears I got. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  They hear pretty good.  Jimmy likes anal log.  Jimmy, when are you coming back to Tampa, Jimmy?  Oh, it's funny you should ask.  I'll be in Tampa.  Really?  Soon.  April 11th and 12th.  Right around the corner.  Sure hoping someone from Ontario, California calls to wonder when I'll be there again.  Uh-oh.  This weekend, tickets available.  Come on.  Just a few, right?  Yeah.  All right, punch it out, boy.  Look at your eyes.  Yeah. 
[02:51:00]  Uh, Little Connor in Kentucky.  Little Connor.  I remember Little Connor.  Hey, how you guys doing over there, man?  Yeah, right.  Uh, we're doing pretty good.  Hey, Jimmy, when are you coming to Nashville again?  Oh, my God.  Uh, Virginia Beach, March 20th for 22nd.  I'll be there.  Thank you.  I just, when that guy was right, that last guy, the issue with albums,  and I 100% agree with Jimmy, but when they first started making them into digital recordings,  they just, when they remaster, they didn't remaster them. 
[02:51:30]  They just recorded them straight over, and you lose a lot of the fidelity when you record  digital, because digital, especially the early days, was a sampling of, like, 72,000 pieces a second.  Now it's much greater.  Okay.  Back then, you lost a lot of fidelity.  So, if you got some old albums, you get all the sound that you lost with digital.  Okay.  All the good shit has been remastered since then.  Like, I just got the Black Sabbath on vinyl, and it sounded exactly the same as the new  13 on digital. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah, like...  That's all I wanted to say, you know.  If someone had a really good system, I'm sure a record sounds great, and there's a nostalgia  to it, too.  And I know what you mean about the little pop and, like, the little...  Like, I mean, I grew up with that, too.  But it's just there's an arrogance that people have about it.  But if someone had a great system to put on a record, I wouldn't go, you know, karate  kick it over.  Enjoy it.  Yeah, you're right, Jimmy.  I'm the exact same way.  And we're the same age.  And, you know, I grew up in Chicago and would listen to that Pink Floyd album when it came  out, but...  Which one?  I didn't listen to Pink Floyd when I was growing up.  Really? 
[02:52:30]  Nah, man.  I got into them later in life.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Thanks, anyway.  Yeah, that was a little...  All right, little Connor.  Thank you, buddy.  Out there.  Yeah, it was...  I liked some of it, but it wasn't like a fave.  No.  Did you get into the Ramones growing up?  I just got into them, like, in the last, say, six or seven years.  I wish I was cool growing up.  Like...  And I'm not talking, like, later on in high school, I started listening to, you know,  heavier music and shit like that.  Yeah.  But earlier on, oh, what a little fruit.  Would you like?  Just listening to...  I would listen to a little hit station. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, all the little hits.  All the little hits.  Aw.  It's all you, brother.  I was there, too, because I had an older sister, and I didn't have my own music yet,  so whatever she was cranking from her room as she was crying, I would enjoy.  I'd be in the car, you know, with my mommy, driving to grandma's house, listening to, you  know, Philadelphia, freedom.  Yeah.  You know, shit like that.  Love, love, love.  Yeah.  Dick, diddick, diddick, diddick, diddick, diddick, yes, I do. 
[02:53:30]  Dick, diddick, diddick.  What about that?  Knock three dots on the ceiling if you...  You know, all that faggy stuff.  Tony Orlando rules.  You like Tony Orlando?  He's the greatest.  These 80s songs, or...  Uh, well, you know what?  Hey, man, they had classic, like, whatever they called it, I guess, classic hits or something  back then.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know what the classic station was?  Stop trying to trip us up.  Child of the 80s, right here, motherfucker.  If you say so.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[02:54:00]  Those stations.  When I was growing up, the oldie stations were playing ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bang.  Growing up when you were in high school.  You don't like fucking Tony Orlando, Sam?  Tony Orlando was the shit.  I mean, I get...  Come on.  I would say...  What's a yellow ribbon around the old oak tree?  No, I'll comfortably say I'm not Tony Orlando.  I hated how everyone on the bus cheered for my Twitter that recently. 
[02:54:30]  I listened to the song, and I hate the whole bus.  The whole damn bus was cheering.  I'll tell you why I hate it, because that means that he told the whole bus,  Yeah, I'm on my way home.  He's like fucking Rosie.  Just a fucking babbling, retarded person on the bus.  Shut up.  You hated that?  You hated that?  Yeah.  I say...  I say...  I'm trying to find my words.  Oh, because I hated it?  I say...  Fucking peanut butter fingers in there.  Oh, and Tony Orlando songs. 
[02:55:00]  Oh, okay.  What is that line again?  And the whole damn...  Oh, uh...  You pitch...  Something, and something...  A pitch in a fit.  A pitching a fit.  Wait, what is it?  Travel's yours.  I think Trez was pitching a fit yesterday.  Yeah, that was pitching a fit.  All this whining, and crying, and pitching a fit.  It's a terrible lyric.  It's terrible.  It's about what's going on on TV, and I got it, and... 
[02:55:30]  Oh, Don Henley kind of like writing about the tape, eh?  Right, Dennis?  Oh, yeah.  A little Dirty Laundry.  Good song.  Bubble Headed Bleach Blonde comes on at...  Five?  Nine?  Six?  Six?  You like Get Over It?  You think that's a good song?  Yeah, it's very catchy.  It's not...  Oh, it's catchy.  It's got a good hook.  It doesn't have a good hook.  It sucks.  It does.  People remember it.  You're always using it.  So what?  People remembered Hitler.  He's got a good hook.  You got you, Dennis.  You got me there.  Touche. 
[02:56:00]  That's the same band that did Hotel California.  You do understand why that sucks, right?  Yeah.  I mean, you're trying to compare things from decade to decade.  The band evolved.  I mean, it's tough to do that.  There are bands that should just say, all right, we can't come up with any more cool songs,  so let's just ride our hits.  Our past songs.  Well, they just don't want to be known as...  YouTube is a rare exception, but most of these bands can't do it anymore.  They don't want to be known as an oldie music goes.  And they want to do new stuff.  It's just sad.  I mean, you go see any group, you know, from the 60s, 70s, or 80s, hey, here's a brand new 
[02:56:30]  album.  And most people leave to go get a refreshment or something because they don't want to hear  it.  I understand that, too.  As an artist, it sucks.  People don't want to hear new stuff, I'm sure.  It's sad.  You know, it's...  A refreshment?  Yeah, what kind of refreshment do you get at a rock show?  Who gets a refreshment?  Maybe they're going for a Diet Coke or something.  Which song should we go get our refreshment in?  You're a fan of a good refreshment, aren't you?  Getting your refreshment while you were at the show?  Everything about you is just awful. 
[02:57:00]  It's just different.  It's just different from your world, that's all.  A refreshment?  Except they do drink.  I don't even like saying the word.  A refreshment.  Go to the snack bar.  Honey, can I get you a refreshment?  Yeah.  And she says, yeah.  Pulls out a gun, shoots her.  That's what Oscar Pistorius was saying.  Oh, boy.  Boy, is he in Dutch?  Oh, boy, he fucked up.  I think he's done.  Oh, he's guilty as shit.  I don't know about their legal system.  Are they tough over there? 
[02:57:30]  Are they going to, like...  It's a judge.  There's no jury, so...  Oh.  That and he is in fucking deep trouble.  How did...  How did...  Why no jury, I guess, is what I'm trying to say.  I don't know if that's their system or if he had a choice.  Yeah, that's what I was trying to figure out.  But he is fucking...  Because she was beautiful.  The eyewitness that heard the gunshots and the screaming and...  And he still shot after the screaming.  Yeah.  Which goes against his theory that it was an intruder and he was shooting through a door.  Well, he did shoot through a door, but...  No, I know, but that he was doing that because it was a... 
[02:58:00]  He was scared.  Yeah.  Well, that's...  They're saying, like, her screams were also because, uh...  Could have been the intruder.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  It's...  Oh, I see what you're getting at that.  He's...  Believe me, when a trial first starts and you start hearing this stuff, you're like,  oh, boy, he's sunk.  But they're going to pull out some shit.  They'll pull out some shenanigans.  And it's not in front of a jury.  It's in front of a judge.  This is, uh...  It's not a slam dunk.  Let me just say that.  I don't know.  I think a judge is worse in these cases. 
[02:58:30]  You think?  Like, a jury...  Because a jury can be swayed.  Like, a judge knows the garbage that you're doing.  I know.  And the legality of it and could just see through the emotion.  Well, that's what it is.  Yeah.  You want it without the emotion in there.  So if he's able to present a case that is compelling enough for the judge to believe that he might have thought this was an intruder,  instead of the jury going, oh, this poor girl.  Oh, this...  Oh, I know guys like that.  Okay.  Take all that shit out of it. 
[02:59:00]  You know, if he's able to present a good case, a solid case, then he's got a better chance with a judge, I think.  She was texting with a guy, I think, the day it was Valentine's Day.  I don't know if she was cheating on him or not, but it was just one of those fucking...  He was watching porn.  Maybe she busted him watching porn, or maybe he looked at her phone and saw her texting.  Stuff might not even be admissible.  No, I'm just speculating.  I'm just saying that it was one of those things where she was so beautiful.  Oh, I'm saying he fucking killed her.  Yeah.  But I'm just saying this isn't the slam dunk everyone thinks it is. 
[02:59:30]  It is.  He could get off.  Abel said walk.  He could walk.  You were saying off mic that you understand his anger.  Yeah, like, I'm not saying he should have shot this girl.  Of course.  But that's why I don't own a gun, because in those moments where you're in a power-driven, furious argument,  I have absolutely been angry enough to kill the person I was arguing with.  Wow.  Holy shit.  And I'm not saying that for any reason other than the fact of...  That's why I've never owned a firearm, because in that moment, you can end their life and ruin their family's lives 
[03:00:00]  and end and ruin your own life.  And like a split second later, you'd be like, oh, oh.  The second you smell that gunpowder or whatever happens when you fire a weapon, you would go, oh, my God, I've done it.  I've done the unreversible.  What goes through your head, though?  I told you, I remember me and my ex were arguing one time, and she wouldn't stop, and it was late, and I was trying to sleep.  And I was, first of all, I was physically stopping my fist from coming over and just punching her in the face. 
[03:00:30]  But I've never hit a girl in my life.  It doesn't take a tough guy to hit a girl, so I don't do it.  But I could feel myself, I could feel the pull of my body wanting me to.  Oh, my God.  And I thought to myself, I want to stab her to death.  Like, I really want to stab her.  Oh, my God.  That's fantastic.  I guess you wanted to hear the vinyl, huh?  What's that?  I guess you wanted to hear the record.  Oh, Dennis. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, Dennis.  That's right.  Oh, you're adorable.  He is adorable.  But he's right.  I think you're saying something that a lot of people feel, Jimmy.  In those moments.  But it's in the craziness of that box.  I've never felt my fist.  I mean, I've been in some arguments, obviously.  But not to the point where I'd rather just walk away and say, fuck it all.  Yeah.  Now I might be able to do that.  But that was more the frustration of she wouldn't leave the house.  Like, I would want her to leave. 
[03:01:30]  Like, let's just stop fighting because I'm feeling myself getting it.  And I don't want to argue.  And she wouldn't go home.  Why didn't you just leave?  It's my house.  I know it's your house, but it was late.  I had to work in the morning.  When I had shitty stuff, I would just leave.  That's another reason.  I wouldn't leave my stuff there.  Yeah.  You never know.  If you have shitty stuff, it's easy to leave your house and just find another place to sleep for the night.  No matter how angry I am, and I've been angry at people, I've never thought of pulling the gun out and not even not using it, like pointing it around. 
[03:02:00]  Like, that never crosses my mind, no matter how angry I am.  Never?  It's just never.  I swear to you.  It's one of those situations where you know that this thing is you have it to save your life or the life of somebody else.  I'm like, if you have one, you might as well use this.  Exactly.  It's like a dust.  I'm with Jimmy.  You might as well use it.  Why else would you have it? 
[03:02:30]  It's one of the biggest responsibilities you could have.  And like you said, you're snuffing out two lives, pretty much.  But if I had one, I may, like, I'm not saying I would do that, because I told you one time I went out to the kitchen, and I was just fucking grabbing that kitchen knife and fucking holding it.  Oh, my God.  Did she know you were holding a knife in the other room?  No, I don't know if she did or not.  I was so angry.  Were you fantasizing at all?  Oh, my God.  I could feel it.  I could literally feel my arm plunging.  Oh, my God.  This is crazy. 
[03:03:00]  And I didn't bring the knife back.  I've never threatened anybody with a weapon or any of that crazy shit.  But, you know, again, in fairness to her, she was probably thinking the same thing, because she wasn't some pussy girlfriend.  Right.  She was a fucking, you guys know her, she was a very ballsy, go fucking, like, she was a relatively, you know, in that world of girlfriends, you know,  she was not a fucking, you know.  She knew how to hang.  She would have thrown her fist right in my fucking fat mouth before I got off a good stab. 
[03:03:30]  And one night, she caught me.  I told you when she caught me dirty texting someone who I'd never fucked.  I was actually, she was so mad at me.  And when she, when I accidentally printed it out on the printer, because I was so fucking dumb.  Oh.  And she came home.  Why did you print it out on the printer?  I'm dumb.  I hit the wrong button.  Made a mistake.  Oh.  And she came home, and it was a Saturday afternoon, and she was in class that day or whatever.  And she goes, uh, get up, Jim.  I'm like, huh?  Jim, get up. 
[03:04:00]  And I knew I was in trouble.  Oh, no.  Because she never would have done that on a Saturday, because I'm such a bad sleeper that I knew she would have fucking...  Was everything running through your head?  I knew something happened.  And she said, uh, by the way, I read your whole chat.  Well, I know what you were talking about.  And she said the girl's screen name, so I knew she had seen a conversation.  I knew I was caught, so I couldn't even really lie.  And I genuinely felt very bad about it.  But the only thing that saved me was, in that conversation, it was obvious that the girl and I had never hooked up. 
[03:04:30]  So she knew it was just an intrigue.  It was one of those things.  She knew I was a big time waster with that shit.  Like, I've talked...  I've had so many sexual conversations about things that I was never going to do.  And, like, she knew that, so that was the only thing that saved me.  But that night, I made her go home.  I was literally, and I'm not kidding, afraid to have her stay over, because I was scared that she was going to fucking stab me.  Wow.  She was so fucking hot under the collar.  Wow.  And she had those eyes, and I'm like, this bitch will fucking kill me in my sleep.  Now I understand why you don't sleep. 
[03:05:00]  I know.  Right, one eye open.  Do you understand why she was mad, though?  Oh, my God, yeah.  She was fucking betrayed, yes.  All right, women don't appreciate that, even if you're not doing anything physically.  A hundred percent, I understand.  And she was a great fuck, and she would have done anything I want.  It was nothing to do with her.  It was my own selfishness.  You know what I learned, too?  If you're in the same room texting, a girl might not be able to read your text, but, boy, can they spot an emoji from across the room.  Yes, they can.  You know what I'm thinking?  Spot, when you think you're slick, holding your phone at a fucking 88-degree angle. 
[03:05:30]  And she said that to me.  And you don't think I see the way you hold your fucking phone?  Like, I guess she did.  She did notice that.  Oh, Jesus.  Let me say hi to Bill in California.  Bill.  Oh, Bill.  Jimmy.  Hi, Bill.  You are certifiable.  But, you know...  How can you possibly say that because you don't have a gun, that's why you haven't killed somebody?  When you're on the street next to a car, do you have the urge to jump in it and run somebody over if you're having an argument? 
[03:06:00]  You know...  I don't understand.  I'll tell you.  One time I was...  Because I have the car, I think that.  I don't do it.  Like, that's why I'm saying maybe I wouldn't have done that in that moment.  You wouldn't have.  I don't know if I would have or not.  But I'm saying in those instant...  I remember one time I had landed an MTV pilot.  Oh, no.  There's another time.  But this was...  Oh, no.  This was years ago.  I lived still in central Jersey.  Oh, that's okay.  And I was driving home.  And I had a good bit of news that day.  And I'm driving my car. 
[03:06:30]  I was kind of cranky behind the wheel.  And I remember all I wanted to do was gun it and kill a pedestrian.  I could feel myself wanting to do that.  And, of course, I didn't do it.  So, dude, I don't know what you're saying.  Like, I'm saying what my mind was saying in that moment.  I'm not saying it's rational or I would have done it.  Yeah, it's certainly not rational.  But, you know, there's a line.  And it seems to me that...  He's got the line because he hasn't done it.  I've got to defend Jimmy a little bit here.  I love his honesty because I think we all have these crazy-ass thoughts in our head. 
[03:07:00]  But we don't act on it.  Like, the feeling of just jumping when you're in a tall building on a ledge or something.  Or, huh?  Or, like, my thing...  Hold on!  Hold on!  God!  Forget it.  What are you saying?  It's so frustrating.  What were you going to say that's so important?  I need to know now, Bill.  Okay.  Sorry, I didn't mean to walk on you there.  What I'm saying is, it's not just that he's had these fantasies or that he's thought about it. 
[03:07:30]  I thought Jimmy said the reason he has not killed somebody is because he doesn't have a gun.  I don't...  That's totally different.  No, Bill.  The point I'm making is, like, I understand.  I can't say for sure I would.  I mean, I'm not a sociopath.  But when I hear Oscar, when I read what happened between him and his girlfriend that night,  like, I get it.  Not I justify it, but in that moment, I know I've been angry enough to do that.  Whether or not I would have, I don't know.  I think, and also people picked up on the fact that your party is joking, too. 
[03:08:00]  No, not really, no.  I mean, I'm being silly.  In those moments, I felt that way, that anger, and it frightened me.  So you're not joking when you say that if I had a gun, I would use it?  But I'm not saying that definitively, because I had a knife, I didn't use that.  I think the guy said I have a car, I would never run anybody over it.  But that's why I think you're joking a little bit.  Not joking.  It's like, in moments where you're that angry, and in a nanosecond, and I know you can with a knife,  but a gun, there's just something so final about a gun. 
[03:08:30]  It frightens me, and I would never, ever own one.  I've never tried to own one, and that's why.  I never trusted myself with it.  Well, I bet you'd be surprised, Jimmy.  I bet you had a gun, and you were in that situation.  There's no way you'd kill somebody.  You might be right, dude.  You honestly might be right.  And I think it goes back to my original point, that that's why I like you're saying this,  because we all have those thoughts.  We don't act out on them in the end.  Like, in your case, it sounds like you got pretty damn close, but you still didn't act out. 
[03:09:00]  Right.  It seems like you could have justified it in your head if you really wanted to go down that road.  And maybe this Oscar guy, if he did it, maybe he's truly crazy, but let's just say that he's not crazy.  Let's just say that he's kind of like most of us, and whatever factors went into it, where I stopped at the age, what made him go to nine or ten?  Like, I'm not blaming her, but like, was his jealousy just a little bit more than mine?  Had he had a couple of drinks, or had they argued before?  What was that fucking final tipping point that made him fire? 
[03:09:30]  Because it's almost like...  He's flipping the eggs with his feet, right?  The last straw.  Maybe that was it.  Yeah, she might have pointed out the fact that...  Go wax your toes.  He has a lot of calces on his palms.  But what pushed him?  I don't know.  What in his mind sent him like that?  Because this is an Olympic athlete who's very disciplined, he trains, he has a lot to live for.  He's a fucking truly worshipped icon in that country. 
[03:10:00]  Oh, yeah.  He's one of the few black and white heroes from the whole country.  Someone's saying in South Africa, they have this shoot first, ask questions later thing.  Oh, really?  So that might help him.  They look at it slightly different.  Did he even mean the killer?  Because he fired angrily through the door, which is almost less personal.  He might, yeah, have been like, you know, take that with you, you know.  Maybe he was assuming that...  Oh, sorry.  Maybe he was assuming she was on the other...  Right, right.  ...where he knows he can shoot through the door and it's just going to scare the crap out of her. 
[03:10:30]  Hey, bitch, yeah, look what I did.  And then, uh-oh, she was...  Whoops.  Hey, Bill.  Yeah?  Sorry I yelled at you.  I was wrong.  Oh, no.  All right.  Jesus.  Good thing you weren't here.  I hope I would have killed you.  I thought I had something fun for the show when you were stomping on me.  Why don't you tell us, though?  No, it's just thoughts we all have.  And one of mine was when I used to go to live tapings of shows, I had the urge to run from  the audience and tackle the host.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was one of my...  Punch the host in the face. 
[03:11:00]  No, I didn't want to do that.  Really?  I remember when Bill Maher first started his...  I've told this story on the air, and I think it was one of the times when you had to go  to L.A.  Yeah.  We went to a Bill Maher taping when it was on Comedy Central, right?  Back then.  And I had this urge that I just wanted to jump over that little barrier, because I think  we were in the front row, if I remember.  Just run right up there.  And I wanted to run and just tackle them.  Be all over the news.  I didn't want to hurt them or anything.  Just to do something of crazy, obnoxious...  Yeah, I get that.  So, I think we all have these, but we hold back from actually doing it. 
[03:11:30]  Absolutely.  But something in other people, that tick goes off, and then you do do it.  Yeah.  Someone says that's why they call it a fit of passion.  I think what you mean is a crime of passion, sir, the guy on Twitter.  But that is why.  It's in those moments.  It's pitching a fit of passion.  Yeah, yeah.  Get over it.  If you're so tall, you can only shoot at her clit.  Get over it.  It's because you get stumps.  We got the chef that was on...  Oh, good.  Cole.  But we're going to have to do it after the break. 
[03:12:00]  So, could someone talk to him?  Because I've got to make we.  But first, Rob in Boston.  Rob.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jimmy.  I love your honesty, brother.  I mean, you know, I think they're just saying some things that go on in all of our heads.  I remember a girl that I dated back in high school for a long time.  I had known she was fucking around on me behind my back.  And she didn't know I knew it.  I didn't have any proof that I knew that she was doing it.  But I knew it was going on.  And I remember leaving my house one afternoon with her, driving down the street. 
[03:12:30]  And, you know, I'm looking at her.  I'm like, you're fucking cheating.  I know you're fucking cheating.  I was in absolute rage.  And she was yapping and yapping and yapping.  I mean, in order to control myself, tell myself that, I literally opened the fucking door and jumped out of the car.  Because I knew that the rage that I had inside me, I just had to get away from her.  It was all I could do to just, you know, control myself and get away from her.  Fuck and roll. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah.  Right out of that vehicle.  But I know.  I know.  I mean, Jimmy, I totally feel you, buddy.  Wait, wait, wait.  How fast was the car going?  We were on a back road.  It wasn't crazy.  Okay.  But at the same time, I feel what Jimmy's saying.  Because, like Chris Rock says, you know, I'm not saying it's okay to kill somebody.  But I understand.  You know what I mean?  Well, you look at the OJ murder, as brutal as it was, I don't know if he went there to do it, if he did whatever.  But the barbaric, crazy, violent, like, that's an explosion. 
[03:13:30]  That's not a pre-planned thing.  You don't do it that sloppy if you're pre-planning it.  That's, like, an explosive thing.  But I think most of us have the ability to have happen under the – if everything lines up right, we all have that ability to have that happen.  I mean, I didn't do – I've never even shoved a girl.  Like, I have zero violent behavior in my life towards anybody.  You should shove a girl.  They go down easy, man.  I'm not violent at all.  I'm a very peaceful person. 
[03:14:00]  But anyway, I just wanted to share.  What a gang.  All right.  I want to acknowledge Hungarian lover today on Twitter.  He tweets, Opie Radio, take your own advice and stick to your hotel, California.  Hashtag 50-gallon drum challenge.  This is why I'm not on Twitter as much.  It's gotten so ridiculous and stupid. 
[03:14:30]  What is that guy's complaint?  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  That's a good one.  I don't think we're in the get-over-it phase of our careers, you idiot.  You gotta love him.  Oh, boy.  Brother Joe wants in on this.  Get over it.  Ah, brother Joe.  Hello, fellas.  Jim, I just wanted to throw in my two cents.  I don't want to make it a gun issue, but by virtue of owning a weapon and firing them 
[03:15:00]  often, it makes you less likely to actually use it in a fit of anger.  That's my opinion.  That's the way I feel about it.  It makes you much less likely.  You understand.  I mean, how many times have you actually fired a handgun, Jimmy?  I don't think I've ever, to be honest with you, I don't think I've ever fired a handgun  just like a rifle when I was in camp when I was a boy.  Oh, boy.  It's a different thing.  I might have been like a BB gun or a .22, but it's a different thing when you fire off 
[03:15:30]  a few rounds out of a 9mm on a regular basis.  I think when you're crazy, I think those crazy guys that, you know, like the fucking  kids that shoot up schools or something, they shoot and they're thinking about it and stuff,  but they're insane.  They're feeling the power of it.  I think if you're a regular person, normal emotions and mental capacity, and you just  buy a gun and throw it in your night table drawer and forget about it, you probably are  a little more apt to think about grabbing it in anger than you would if you're going to 
[03:16:00]  the range and you're understanding what a weapon can do, all the safety that it takes  and responsibility that it takes.  I think you're right as far as that goes there, Joe.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  That's it.  You might be right.  I mean, that's why I'm saying if I own what, I may feel differently.  Yeah.  But I just didn't, I've never made that leap because I don't trust myself.  I would not advocate you having a weapon of any sort.  No.  No.  You have Kenny.  That's a good weapon.  A shotgun I would feel more comfortable with.  Honestly, I'll tell you why.  Why?  Because I would never, first of all, I would never shoot myself, but if I was going to, 
[03:16:30]  it would never be with a shotgun because too many people live through that because they  do it wrong.  Oh, you see that guy's picture?  Yeah.  He's been on the web recently.  Yeah, he whole nose.  My breathing would be terrible if my nose got shot off.  You know the custom mask you'd need for your apnea?  Oh, my God.  You've thought about something that looks like a daisy.  You've thought about shooting yourself?  Oh, yeah.  Gentlemen, can I do a really quick plug for Ulysses this morning?  Oh, of course.  Sure.  Saturday night, Ulysses, two year.  We're doing all the new stuff.  We're going to be doing Invisible, Ordinary Love, and probably that Aslan cover as well. 
[03:17:00]  Nice.  Good for you, Joe.  All right.  All right there, Joe.  One more.  Rob in Jersey.  Rob.  First time, one time.  Hi.  Whack, whack.  Wow.  Amazing.  I think Jimmy's using his cake horn to tell if he's crazier than Fez.  No.  Jimmy has some crazy stuff coming out of his cake horn.  Cake horn.  He's not going to be a fish ball either.  Yeah.  There's some comedy in that word, cake horn.  I love cake horn.  I should have realized at that point. 
[03:17:30]  Cake horn is great.  Dennis, just an amazing appearance.  I really appreciate it.  So we're good for St. Patrick's Day, right?  Yeah, we are.  Do you have any songs that you would go to right now after this discussion?  How about Bang Bang by Cher?  Bang Bang, My Baby Shot Me Down.  That's a good song.  Yeah.  Is that a...  Shotgun, Shoot Him Before He Run Now, Junior Walker and the All-Stars.  Oh.  Motown song.  Oh, there you go.  I Shot the Sheriff.  I Shot the Sheriff.  Okay, we can go there.  How about a little runaway?  As in...  As in please.  As in please.

Opie and Anthony have been excelling at this for 20 years.  Need proof?  Listen to this 20th anniversary Opie and Anthony radio jam.  Hey, Chris.  What was your story of the year?  It's the end of the year here.  What's the one story that made you go, this was a good year?  Two girls, one cup.  Two girls, one cup.  Is it a great one? 
[03:28:00]  What's two girls, one cup?  Oh, Jesus.  We just don't have time, unfortunately.  Wish we had it here.  Wow.  I'm surprised you don't know it.  It's a video that's just gone completely viral on YouTube, and it's two girls, one cup, and one girl fills the cup with a lovely thick treat.  Yeah, she could have got it from Baggage Clam in India.  Yeah.  Two girls, one cup, and India.  Just put those all together.  They both share it. 
[03:28:30]  It's hard to find an actual video.  You just have, if you type it up, it's just people watching it.  Yeah.  And you're not seeing it.  Yeah, now it's people's reaction to watching it that people are watching.  Two girls, one cup.  I'll try to remember that.  Yeah.  It's easy.  It's a good one.  Twogirlsonecup.com.  I just never, you know.  Do you troll around looking at videos?  I troll around, and I never press, you know, S-H-I-T.  Yeah.  I've never been that.  I've never been that.  Oh, Chris, for the viewing pleasure.  Well, here it is.  It starts off with a nice-seeing girl-on-girl action, and then you get... 
[03:29:00]  Oh, no!  No!  No!  No!  Oh, they do, they have to step it up.  Oh, look at that.  Come on, Chris.  They step it up.  They step it up. 
[03:29:30]  Come on.  Don't be a rookie.  Come on.  Come on.  What the hell?  Oh, look at that.  Stop!  They really step it up.  God, they step it up.  Look at that.  That's our favorite part.  Come on, look.  There you go.  There it is.  We just want to make sure you don't forget your time on the Opie and Anthony show.  Two girls, one cup.  Why, indeed. 
[03:30:00]  Why?  You're not going to forget us, right, Chris?  Why?  That was wonderful.  Where do you get those girls?  That makes me breathe better when I see them.  I think I found a new opening act.  The Opie and Anthony show is back on Sirius XM.  I think that's pretty cool.  We turned Chris Rock on to Two Girls, One Cup.  I forgot about that clip.  Oh, yeah.  Chris Rock and Patrice O'Neal in studio at the same time. 
[03:30:30]  Yeah, we can't rock.  Unbelievable.  I remember when I was growing up, when this song was out, my friend Tyler, his mother was talking about Paul Stanley.  She didn't know who Kiss was.  And she said, he's pretty.  She thought he was a pretty white guy.  Yeah, she's black.  Oh, jeez.  Pretty.  Lick it up.  So we got Chef Keith on the line.  Lick it up.  Yes.  A little earlier in the show. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, I wanted to hear the rest of that song, but I guess we could.  Oh, thank you.  We could do that.  I forgot.  All right, we got to move on.  Yeah.  Two hours listening to Kiss.  I don't know.  Maybe a little more, though.  Just a little more.  Thank you.  All right.  Let's know get over it, but it'll do.  So you got this, dare I say, prankster, Chef Keith.  Yes. 
[03:31:30]  He's got a couple of videos that are going viral today.  He's hilarious.  Basically, he went on the local news programs and kind of made believe he was a real chef  with some clever, clever ideas.  And he's just dopes.  It was ridiculous.  If you watch it, it's a ridiculous segment where anybody in their right mind would go,  this guy's like he's screwing up our news show.  Right.  So our Twitter account, O&A Show, tweeted the videos.  But we want to talk to him, and we got him, man. 
[03:32:00]  Chef Keith.  What's up, Keith?  Hey, good morning.  You got the exclusive.  This is huge.  This is just amazing.  I can't believe we got this one.  He's calling from Kiev.  Right.  We love the videos, sir, because we love making fun of the local news.  We think they're all just completely ridiculous.  Yeah.  Well, thanks.  Yeah.  Well, we do a show called the Found Footage Festival, my buddy Joe Pickett and I, and we 
[03:32:30]  often do these local morning news shows in, like, Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and things  like that, and, you know, nobody ever really listens to what you're saying, and it's 6 a.m.,  and I mean, I never know who's watching at that point, like farmers or whoever, and they  always had on TV chefs, too, so we were back in Wisconsin, where we were from originally  over the holidays, and I was kind of bored, and we thought it'd be fun to try to get on  as a chef, and so that's where Chef Keith came from. 
[03:33:00]  Right.  How did you actually get on?  Yeah, because we were trying to figure that out.  I mean, like I said, we know they're stupid, but they can't possibly be that stupid where  they're not checking into it.  Well, there wasn't much vetting.  We wrote up a press release that had a fake book cover on it, and, you know, made an e-mail  from a publishing company, and then also wrote a fake article for Good Housekeeping that I  wrote in November, and had the mashed potato ice cream cone recipe on it, and so we just 
[03:33:30]  attached that to the e-mails, and we sent out 10, and we got seven responses back, and they  all wanted them.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Were you nervous the first time you went on TV to try it out?  Well, I mean, I'm a sociopath.  I lack empathy, so no.  Okay.  Okay.  No, no, actually, I was terrible, because I knew I had to come over and knock over a  table on live television, so.  I told you, Jimmy.  I said he absolutely did that on purpose.  Oh, you did?  That was very funny. 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we scored the leg of it beforehand, and kind of set it on the edge of this platform,  and then, yeah, there's an entire turkey and a microwave and a full gallon of milk  on there when it smelled.  And they just panicked and went to, I think it was weather on that clip.  Yeah, yeah, they just, yeah, kind of called for a lifeline and threw it straight back to  the news anchors at that point.  And just coming up with ridiculous things.  Yeah, we played the one with the ice cream cone with the, you pour the gravy on the bottom 
[03:34:30]  of it, but you don't even heat up the gravy, because your hand's going to warm it up.  Well, that was the grossest thing, was that, you know, all the restaurants were closed on  Christmas, so the only thing that was open was KFC.  So we'd go into the Kentucky Fried Chicken and get mashed potatoes and gravy, and then  it'd sit in my rental car in freezing Wisconsin weather overnight, and it'd be this cold,  gelatinous mass in a milk jug.  And then it'd be like, you know, 5.30 in the morning, and I'd be in the dark parking lot 
[03:35:00]  in the rental car with the light on, like lining up cranberries on a chicken leg, just kind  of questioning what I was doing with my life.  But they bought it!  Yeah.  They bought right in!  Yeah, no one questioned it.  Everyone afterwards was polite, thanked me for coming, you know, wished me the best of  luck on my book signing, and then actually one woman apologized to me for the segment  not going better. 
[03:35:30]  Now there's a montage clip out there where you make her taste the blended up, I think it  was Thanksgiving leftovers, but they don't show her reaction.  What happened there?  She took just the littlest sip, but she went right for it, which surprised me, but she  just took the littlest sip, and this smoothie, it doesn't really show up on the video, but  it was, I mean, it was raw cranberries in milk, there were pieces of turkey in it, and I didn't 
[03:36:00]  have time to blend it up very much, so it was just kind of like a chunky stew that just  really smelled bad, and she put it up to her lips, tasted it a little bit, and then put  on a brave face.  Right.  She's professional, yeah.  Amazing.  But have you thought these recipes through, because they don't sound like they're very  tasty.  The answer is no.  These are just basically the stupidest concepts you could come up with.  When you're blending up the leftovers, and then you're pouring it into the milk container 
[03:36:30]  to save?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  There's six meals in here.  Yeah, yeah.  There's six meals in here.  And then you pour those blended-up leftovers on your leftovers.  Right.  Oh, my gosh.  You're cannibalizing your own leftovers.  That's great.  Well, and then on one of the segments, I had a pre-made Turbo Gravy milk jug with a bow  on it for them as kind of a gift to the cast crew of the morning show.  And I heard back from one of the news shows that after this went viral, they looked in 
[03:37:00]  their break room refrigerator, and it was still there with the bow on it.  Oh, no kidding.  Send me a picture of it.  So I guess there are no takers.  When did you make all these videos?  It was, we were back for Thanksgiving, and then again over Christmas.  So we just did it like the day, a couple days after Thanksgiving and after Christmas.  Oh, okay.  Relatively new.  I wasn't sure if they were a couple years old or whatever.  Yeah, no, we just decided to post on Monday because we have this big Sound Footage Festival  national tour launching on Thursday. 
[03:37:30]  So we thought it was some hits.  It must have been tough to hold back on those videos, knowing you had gold.  It was.  And we play more of the videos in our live show and tell the story.  But yeah, it was hard because we knew we had something there, but we had to wait until  the right time to launch it.  Did anyone catch on at all?  Did you get the inkling that somebody might have been like, hmm?  I really didn't. 
[03:38:00]  You know, when the table got knocked over, and it's me and the news anchor with a mop  trying to mop up all the spilled milk and everything, she didn't look happy about it, and I felt  bad.  But she, at the end of it, just said, you know, I bet a lot of people come to your book  signing today because this is a memorable TV moment.  Ah, there you go.  Yeah.  So even then, the veneer was not lost.  She still thought I was an author and chef.  They really are amazing. 
[03:38:30]  But cutting out the pita, you know.  Yeah, with the marker, the Sharpie.  The Sharpie.  On the bread.  Making that turkey hand.  Yeah.  And then you apologize.  There was a ton more ideas of recipes that we weren't able to do.  Yeah.  But yeah, the hand turkey things, the ants on a leg.  Right.  Raw cranberries on a turkey leg.  I mean, we just kept pushing it further and further as we realized people would try anything.  Well, I'm telling that one woman that people eat a pound and a half of fecal matter every 
[03:39:00]  year.  Fecal matter.  What a great fact.  Right.  That's a fun statistic at 6.30 a.m.  Well, we pointed out, besides being a really brilliant idea, your delivery on your lines  were really, really funny.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Nice timing on the whole thing.  You give them just enough, like you'll say some little aside that's really funny, and  then go right back to the conversation, so they can't really address what you just said. 
[03:39:30]  They kind of nervously laugh and continue.  It's really funny, man.  And you brought up Gigi Allen.  Yeah.  Gigi Allen.  As an influence.  What's the most inappropriate name to bring up?  Of course.  And what?  They just nodded like, yeah, we know Gigi.  Oh, Gigi Allen.  No, I haven't heard of him, but...  You do realize he shoved bananas up his ass and then threw it at the audience, right?  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you more about it.  I think your audience is going to love this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're going to love this in the morning. 
[03:40:00]  And then Turbo Lover you brought up.  Yeah, Turbo Lover.  Turbo Gravy.  Turbo Gravy.  Yeah, but that's a bad boy song.  Just the wrong audience for this kind of song.  Of course.  There's a pre-song called Turbo Lover.  It's like, what's that got to do with anything?  Right.  And now your last name is not Gerky.  It is not.  My full name's Nick Pruer, but when I was growing up in Madison, Wisconsin, they had  a thing called Madison's Most Wanted that would air on local TV. 
[03:40:30]  It was all the most wanted criminals in the area.  Yeah.  And we would sit around and watch the show at two in the morning on public access TV and  record it and pick out our favorite criminals.  And my favorite guy was this guy named Keith Gerky.  Keith R. Gerky.  And he was just kind of this mulleted man with a thin mustache.  I think he was in for battery or something.  But he had such a great look.  So we thought, let's pay tribute to him as a chef here.  Nice.  Do you have any other videos that you're holding back or is that it? 
[03:41:00]  I don't.  We have some ideas.  We've kind of got to wait until this blows over and do the other one.  You may have seen, though, a few years ago with our friend Mark Proks, we did a prank  on news shows called Kenny Stratzer, the yo-yo actor.  Of course.  We play that today as well.  Oh, okay.  Where he's getting all tangled up in the yo-yos.  Yeah.  So, you know, we're looking at other things that are on morning shows.  You know, there's like somebody coming on telling you how to do fun things with a scarf, you 
[03:41:30]  know, and doing fashion shows and things like that.  So really, the possibilities are endless.  Yeah.  They really are endless, man.  When you watch these news shows, you see these segments and they almost look like a goof  when they're real.  I was going to say, even when they're legit, they look, yeah.  So you could get away with a lot, man.  Well, congratulations.  A lot of time to fill, yeah.  Congratulations, man.  We loved it.  Yeah, I thought it was great.  We absolutely loved it.  Thanks, guys.  I'll let you know when the next thing hits.  Cool.  So what are you promoting?  The Found Footage Festival. 
[03:42:00]  What is that about?  Yeah, we find old VHS tapes like exercise videos, training videos, other people's home  movies.  We find them at like Salvation Army's and Goodwills.  And we watch them all, pick out, you know, the funny parts and edit them into digestible  chunks.  And then it's sort of like a live guided tour of our video collection.  So we track down the people in the videos.  And yeah, we tour all over the country.  It's our 10th anniversary with the show.  Wait, were you the guys that did Winnebago Man? 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  Well, we didn't direct it, but we were in the movie.  No, that's what I mean.  Where you brought them around?  Yeah, Jack Rebney.  Holy shit, that's you guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a career highlight for sure, meeting the angry RV guy at one of our shows.  I didn't make the connection.  So yeah, you guys found Winnebago Man, and then you toured with the guy a little bit  and showed the...  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Yeah, well, when he found out we were showing his videos all across the country, he was  upset by it. 
[03:43:00]  And that's, I guess we should have known, you know, he's called the angriest RV salesman  in the world.  Very angry, yeah.  Really.  Well, when he came to the show in San Francisco, like, his arms were folded, he was very, you  know, sort of cross with us, but when he saw how much joy this brought to people and  how many people were laughing, you know, we described him as like the Grinch, where his  heart grew three times that day, you know, we hugged him at the end, and, you know, this  was a guy who called a fly a goddamn jackass.  Right.  So he's a poet, really. 
[03:43:30]  Wow, I didn't make the connection.  That's very cool.  Yeah, I thought what you guys were doing was very clever and very unique, so.  Yeah, thanks.  It's fun.  We're continually surprised that people do it, so.  And you've been touring with these tapes for a while now, huh?  Yeah, this is our 10th anniversary.  Wow.  Yeah, it's crazy.  So this is a brand new show we just launched, all new stuff we found over the last year on  tour.  All right, turn us on to one, one really good one you found.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, there's one we found on Long Island at a thrift store. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, God, I hope it's not one of my old air checks.  It's called Special Delivery, pretty innocuous title, but the subtitle is A Practical Guide  to Welping.  And you know what welping is?  We didn't know what it was.  No, welting.  Welping, with a P.  Welping?  Oh.  This is a puppy giving birth.  Oh, okay.  It's welping.  So this is a video for dog breeders about welping. 
[03:44:30]  And so there's a sort of a woman who looks like a dog breeder, basically, hosting the  show.  And she comes out, and it's pretty normal.  And then she says, well, by now you should know that your bitch is pregnant.  And then, you know, they don't realize it, but they continue saying it.  Like, she interviews a veterinarian, and he's like, well, you have an overweight bitch.  Now, the problem with a fat bitch is that it can affect the birthday process.  Yeah, they don't realize how entertaining it is to watch somebody saying that. 
[03:45:00]  They just think it's, you know, normal.  We're talking about a dog.  Right.  Right.  And it's like, you know, I think they don't realize that the word has been reclaimed  to mean something else.  So they're continuing on, and, you know, like, talking to dog breeders, like, how do you  handle your bitches, Jeremy?  And so we cut together all, I think it's 68 bitches from the video in a row.  And it's pretty incredible.  And it's on the site?  It's not on the site.  It opens up the live show.  We'll post a clip from it soon on our website. 
[03:45:30]  Oh, you son of a bitch.  Because we were going to play it right now.  And now we can't.  If you give away the milk, you're not going to want to buy the cow.  That's our...  All right.  All right.  But, no, yeah, foundfootagefest.com has a bunch of different videos, exercise videos,  and the Jack Rebney video, of course.  Okay.  Very good.  Really, really good stuff, Keith.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Take it easy.  All right.  See you guys.  All right.  There you go.  I didn't know it was the same guy.  You saw Winnebago Man, right?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:46:00]  That guy's a...  He's a hoot.  He really is.  A pleasure.  What a joy.  Can we find the original video?  You want to win a Bag-O-Man video?  No, no, no.  Whelping.  Whelping?  No, we probably would have a tough time finding it.  Puppy whelping.  Oh.  Poor little things.  Yeah.  Hey, sometimes you got to break a pup in.  Yeah, you got to teach you how to whelp. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, see the puppies get hurt when they're young.  That's when the older dog shows the young puppy how to make an older dog happy.  Sometimes you got to lick your paws.  It's alarming.  Get the back really wet.  It's just alarming.  Lick your paws and get it wet.  Yeah.  That teach you how to whelp.  Yeah.  Yeah, don't you go crying.  This is part of nature.  Yeah, show you how to give birth. 
[03:47:00]  Everyone gets creeped out in the room.  It's not fun.  I don't know how to react to it.  It's not fun or anything.  No, it's just creepy.  What to do?  That's what the puppies, you show them the movie.  Look how happy the puppies are when they're whelping.  Oh.  As long as they're happy.  I'm going to teach you how to whelp where the poo comes out.  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  Should we find another video from that guy's site?  After the break?  It's just got to get worse and worse.  You think he's a creep?  Oh, it's so creepy to listen to. 
[03:47:30]  Just go back in time and you think to yourself, did that happen to me?  I don't even know.  Uh-oh.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  That's understandable.  Your memories are a little washed away.  I didn't say that.  Get your back kissed.  Remember that?  On Long Island.  Found Footage Festival.  Footage Fest.  FoundFootageFest.com.  Okay.  For more of those type of videos.  Imagine your mind just like snaps in. 
[03:48:00]  You're like, oh my God.  You all of a sudden remember this horrific abuse.  Oh, God.  That you had.  It was like, holy shit.  What the fuck happened?  That would be pretty goddamn bad.  Yeah, but you got to remember your part in it.  Crawling around like that.  Oh, look at my legs.  You know, he's blaming the adult.  That must be the fuck.  Sitting there drinking some sardine, Earl.  You know what you was doing.  Sardine, Earl.  Sure.  You'd put it on your fingers. 
[03:48:30]  I'd suck it off your fingers.  I hear you.  You'd dip your hand in the sardine, Earl.  Here, Uncle Paul.  I know most people have seen this, but can we play the trailer for Winnebago Man?  You want the trailer or the original Winnebago Man video?  Well, it's a long video.  A coup tremant.  Yeah, play the trailer.  Because this really was a terrific little film.  Would you do me a friendly?  Please.  Here we go.  The Winnebago Concepts and Engineering Departments have developed a multifunctional bathroom. 
[03:49:00]  Privacy, I don't even know what the fuck I'm reading.  I'm going to slate this.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Yeah, you big dumb son of a...  He's angry.  What happened?  Oh, it's...  Wait.  I don't want any more bull from anyone.  That includes me.  I love this clip.  I watch it, like, every time I'm in a bad mood.  Oh, so I've seen this, like, hundreds of times.  This guy's a legend.  Yep. 
[03:49:30]  F***ing make my mind work.  Chad Redney would be the holy grail of stars to meet from these videos.  We could never find him, so we just assumed he was gone.  We went and found the guy.  You start to think, well, who is this guy?  What happened to him?  That's weird.  There's no property.  There's no cars.  There's no voter registration.  What does that mean?  You don't want anybody to really know who you are and what you're about.  This is Jack Redney.  It's inconceivable to me that you would have any interest in this. 
[03:50:00]  But if you want to talk, I'm interested.  I'm in the middle of nowhere.  Hello, I'm Jack Redney.  I'm known as the angriest man on Earth.  A coutrema that you will need.  A coutrema?  What is that?  Yeah, it's always wanted an audience.  I just don't think that you're taking advantage of this group of people that you can talk to.  I have no relationship with YouTube.  The only thing it will come to is how this guy's been crazy all his life. 
[03:50:30]  I'll give you a couple of diatribes.  Action Jack.  How's your audio?  Is everything all right there?  Security guard right there.  Call the police now.  Get the gasapo.  Want to talk about me?  Yeah.  I'm very old.  I'm very crotchety.  What else is new?  If you don't like it, pack up.  Get the f*** out.  Here we go.  Buckle up. 
[03:51:00]  Yes!  Redney!  You believe any of that s***?  Sweet amigo.  Get out of here, you f***ing fly s***.  That's a trailer.  It was amazing, though.  I love that movie, though.  Guy goes away.  Right.  Just f***ing disappears.  And then years later, it's like, hey, that thing you did.  You're a big star now.  How do you know?  And they just showed Chef Keith. 
[03:51:30]  I recognize him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was in that one little clip there.  I didn't know that guy was connected to Winnebago.  Oh, it's a small world.  It's kind of cool.  And Winnebago, man, when they found him in the middle of nowhere, in the mountains or  whatever, he was blind.  Remember?  What year was that documentary?  Oh, right.  I would say about five years old by now, right?  It was 2010, so about...  Okay, four or five years.  And remember he had all the string and rope so he could walk around his place.  Oh, is that what that was for? 
[03:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he couldn't sing anymore, really.  Yeah.  And then they brought him on tour because these guys, like you said, they find all these weird  tapes and they just tour with him.  What a smart idea.  Yeah.  And one of them was Winnebago, man.  And then, you know, the rest is history.  They brought him out on tour and filmed the whole thing.  All right.  So that's that.  And that's that.  And now this is this.

Don't bother. You're fired.  Are you serious?  As a heart attack.  Who is this?  Go to unemployment instead.  Who is this?  You've just been phone slammed.  Why do you keep calling me? 
[03:56:00]  Goodbye.  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show, the guys learn old habits die hard.  Jimmy, you okay, man? You feel all right?  Yeah.  You seem sick or something.  You fucking guys don't appreciate me, man.  When Jimmy shows up late, questions arise.  You all right? You sure you're fine?  I'm late fucking one.  One fucking time.  Jimmy, I'm going to ask you something very...  You might be sensitive here.  What? Yeah, I don't fucking... 
[03:56:30]  What the fuck do I care?  Have you been drinking?  Who fucking cares?  What? Do you fucking care all of a sudden?  You don't give a fuck.  Listen as friends and listeners come together to solve a problem.  Well, Mongo, the trucker, he wants to know how you feel about E-Rock.  Fuck Mongo.  What, are you part of the fucking show?  But now it's the Opie and Anthony and Mongo show?  Get fucked, Mongo.  But at least he still thinks Gary sucks.  I think we've proven we care.  Ha! Yeah!  Fucking, where's Gary?  Fuck him.  Laugh, love, and learn. 
[03:57:00]  You're not going to drink today, right?  I'm just fucking doing what I do, man.  You do what you do, I'm fucking just doing what I do.  Fair enough.  Next week on a very special Opie and Anthony show.  Fuck you, I'm fine.  The Opie and Anthony show is back on Sirius XM. 
[03:57:30]  I smell sandwiches.  I gotta tell you.  Oh.  I'll wait for Jimmy.  I gotta tell you.  Jimmy.  I gotta tell you.  I wanted to wait for you.  Hi, buddy.  You do know that the listeners love when we eat on the air.  Oh, yeah, they're happy for us.  Like, ah, the guy's got some good chow.  Good, good, good comfort.  Apparently.  I can't believe we didn't promote the fact that we would be eating sandwiches today on the show.  It was a surprise.  I apologize to the listeners. 
[03:58:00]  I do apologize.  We know that they like budgeting their time.  Yes.  So they're not, like, going into work or something.  Maybe they could call in and take the day off.  Right.  Because they know we're going to be eating food.  Exactly.  They don't want to miss that.  No.  What?  What are prosciutto balls?  I don't know, but prosciutto's really mad.  See?  He says.  He goes, he he he he.  Roland, how's the diet? 
[03:58:30]  Motherfucker.  Well, today is a celebratory day because of Eric's birthday.  Oh.  It's a celebratory day.  Should we have a surprise weigh-in?  I'm kidding.  Surprise weigh-in?  Anyone?  What a coincidence.  It's also Fat Tuesday.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I also got a text that Sunday was a celebratory, which he texts the same way he says.  Celebratory day because of the Oscars.  That means he's not fucking.  Ah, celebratory. 
[03:59:00]  This sandwich is so damn good.  I went for the healthy option.  Yeah, Leone's is the best.  Oh, my God.  Where did it go?  You go Leone's, you get a happy sandwich.  Where is it?  Leone's.  What's in the box?  The Leone's guys, they've come by before.  Oh, yeah.  Yes, a few times.  Mm-hmm.  It's hard to not eat this stuff.  There, how about it?  Where's it?  What's that?  They said it was Ali.  No, they just like it because they think it's cool. 
[03:59:30]  Oh, it's a happy birthday, Iraq.  Oh.  This is one of those classic segments that we'll have to save.  Yeah, this will make the podcast.  Mm-hmm.  That smells very good.  Oh, it was today Iraq's birthday?  Well, it was Sunday, but...  How come we're not celebrating with a big song?  I've never wanted to push a phone into a cake.  Iraq is holding his phone over his cake.  Just smack it down onto it.  Yeah, should we sing?  How old are you, E?  Yeah, how old a fucking lad are you?  Get up to that mic and torture it.  You're 40?  Yeah, he's 40 today. 
[04:00:00]  Wow.  No, wrong employee.  Oh, I'm sorry, 40 on Sunday.  No, still wrong employee.  I am 36.  Wow.  Yeah.  Over the hump.  Right.  On that highway down to 40.  Yep.  Yeah.  Is that the expression?  Oh, yeah.  Right over the hill.  You know when you're driving in maybe the desert somewhere where you see that long stretch  of road, and there's a hill?  Right.  And you come over the top, and you just see, after you crest the top of the hill, you see  all that land spread out, that's the rest of your life. 
[04:00:30]  Oh.  And you can pretty much see it.  Oh.  Like in the end?  Yeah, yeah.  The end of the road is there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, the lights of L.A.  You know what that means, right?  It's over.  Mm-hmm.  Not seeing the light.  Oh.  Oh.  Once you get past the desert, that's the afterlife.  Well, no.  The light is the end.  Yeah.  And you see it in the distance.  Happy birthday, Eric.  Thank you.  I guess.  How do we act? 
[04:01:00]  We don't know it's his birthday.  He got those Simpson gifts.  We went over his gifts.  Yeah.  Right.  We knew it was his birthday.  I forgot.  Well, we wanted, we didn't want to say anything that Roland was going to do this big food  thing, but I think Iraq knew, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, he knew.  Iraq, you can't have that stuff because of the diet, right?  What diet?  Oh, boy.  He's maintaining.  Yeah, he's in the maintenance phase.  He's just maintaining.  I'll take it off from the bread and dip into it.  Oh, that sounds good.  Are you staying on some kind of diet?  Yeah, I had my smoothie this morning. 
[04:01:30]  And a tea.  Okay.  That was it.  Smoothie and a tea, you might as well have a sub.  Well, it would be rude not to.  They came all this way.  Well, yeah.  You had your meal replacement for the morning, so you might as well have a nice sandwich at  10 a.m., right?  Yeah, that'll be...  They played your song during the Oscars.  Which song?  Let it go.  Okay. 
[04:02:00]  Wow.  That's a good celebration.  Kenny, are you going to have a sandwich?  This segment is not a home run.  No, it is, Jimmy.  I'm telling you.  People love it.  They really do.  We don't even have to put a lot of effort in it.  Iraq, tell them.  You only get one birthday and one two days after your birthday.  Right.  So, you know, help yourself.  According to Roland, yes.  What do you and the wife do?  Anything?  Dinner?  We had some family over on Saturday and had barbecue.  It was delicious.  Barbecue?  That's healthy.  It is. 
[04:02:30]  Oh, you've sent out for, like, barbecue.  We had it catered, yes.  Oh, okay.  I was going to say it's a little cold.  Brisket, ribs.  Did you have a special treat on your birthday?  On your actual birthday.  On the actual birthday, she made my favorite dinner.  That's good.  At least she's helping you.  So, this is your third big celebratory meal?  This would be it.  Congratulations.  You deserve it.  What was your favorite dinner?  I need to know your favorite meal.  My favorite meal is German goulash.  That's delicious.  What a fucking shitty favorite meal that is. 
[04:03:00]  Of course it is.  Wait, you're having hot soup?  Goulash is amazing.  Yeah, I know.  Goulash is amazing, but why is German goulash amazing?  What's the difference?  It's a thick brown sauce with a beef stew in it all day in a crock pot.  Well, it's goulash.  And then you have noodles with Jarlsberg cheese melted on it.  And sour cream and cucumbers.  Can we do a surprise weigh-in, Sam?  No.  Please.  I think fair is fair.  You've had three birthday meals.  I need to know.  Good.  And your fly's open. 
[04:03:30]  It's always open, you faggot.  Yeah.  So Opie will show his big delicious cock?  It's hard not to look over.  That's just meal number four.  It's screaming out for a kiss.  Yeah, it's dessert.  We'll eat cake.  You can eat that.  Speaking of meat.  Look what's hanging out of Opie's pants.  Yeah, exactly.  Speaking of prosciutto.  A little quick weigh-in.  Have a couple bites.  Jump on the scale.  Why not?  What sandwich is that?  Roast beef? 
[04:04:00]  Roast beef.  Roast beef.  American.  Yeah, this shit's pretty righteous.  Prosciutto.  Yep.  That's the one I'm having.  I'm not going to get in trouble for saying faggot.  Maybe.  See what happens now?  You've got to think about this stuff.  Uh-huh.  Well, it's not like you meant it in a game.  Oh.  Is that the problem?  No, it's fine, dude.  You're a fucking co-worker.  Jesus.  We're all right.  You never know.  What are you eating, Anthony?  Same thing.  Roast beef.  What did you have?  That looked good.  It was amazing. 
[04:04:30]  Turkey and some kind of cheese.  Is there any more turkey?  No mayo or anything, though.  A little vinegar and oil.  I took half the bread off.  The pepper brought it all together nicely.  I don't have anything to eat.  It's turkey with eggplant, though.  Oh!  Hey, you fucking eggplant.  I only had one little sliver.  How's the birthday boy's sandwich?  Delicious.  We get a scale.  That's what I'm talking about.  No, he said no.  No, he didn't.  I did say no.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I did say no. 
[04:05:00]  Adrian will bring the scale in.  Okay.  Did you have any intimate time for your birthday?  Yeah.  It's always nice.  Get your big prick sucked.  Get that big hefty prick sucked.  Think he's got a heavy one?  Oh, yeah.  E-Roc's got a big hefty prick.  Because it probably sticks to his balls.  So when he pulls it out and yanks it, his pricking balls are all one unit.  Fucking sweat holding his balls.  Like he has a heart on it.  His balls are still gripping the underside of his prick.  Is that the Kay's birthday boy? 
[04:05:30]  Is he going to peel it off like a fruit roll up?  It was fun.  Nice.  Can I try the icy on this?  Go ahead.  You guys working on a baby?  Oh, me and E-Roc?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I keep practicing in his mouth.  It doesn't work that way.  Oh.  We're waiting.  You're dipping it in, right?  We're waiting to see.  No bag, right?  No bag.  You're just fucking, let fly.  Yeah. 
[04:06:00]  Release the hounds.  Unleash hell.  Wow.  I just had a bit of frosting.  You know, guys, I love frosting.  Oh, God.  Who doesn't?  I think I'm in trouble for St. Faggot.  No.  With who?  I don't know.  Those imaginary people.  They get people in trouble.  You forgive Opie, E-Roc?  Those imaginary people.  No, yeah, I'm fine.  E-Roc's cool with it.  Don't even worry about it.  I mean, because he's, you know, from that era.  He used to just say the word. 
[04:06:30]  You didn't mean anything by it like that.  Say the word.  You talking about the 80s?  80s, yeah.  What kind of sandwich was that?  Well, that's pretty good.  I'm good.  What kind you have at it?  I had that roast beefy thing.  Here.  Have the rest of it.  These sandwiches are massive.  Oh, my God.  Huge.  I took one sliver.  Look at how much I got left.  Yeah.  This is at least another two pounds of food.  That is a good goddamn roast beef.  I'm having Kenny get me two pretzels instead.  Oh, Jimmy. 
[04:07:00]  You're being a good boy.  What's the big plug?  And do they bring envelopes?  Oh, they...  Do these guys bring the envelopes?  They wanted...  The plug for these guys is...  The sandwiches, yes.  ...is April 24th through 27th at Caroline's.  They'll be bringing sandwiches to the audience for my show.  They probably would.  No.  They probably would do just that for you.  They're called...  Let's see.  Instagram.  I don't know if you're going to follow them on Instagram.  What are they called?  Leone Heroes.  L-I-O-N-I Heroes is one word.  And their food is really... 
[04:07:30]  And on Facebook, Leone Heroes.  But I don't follow food places on Twitter and stuff like that.  No, pretty much.  But you can probably get information about where they're located.  Hey, Sam, are you letting your jizz fly?  I let my jizz fly.  Yeah.  Wow.  You sticking that unclipped prick in her?  It's always clipped.  We've been over this.  Can you just imagine that?  E-Rock has a baby and Sam and...  Ow.  What are you going to do?  That'd be pretty amazing.  You think so?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they're old now.  Sure. 
[04:08:00]  They're not youngsters.  That's what I mean.  It's like...  But it would be...  You know...  Sam's like 32 or so at this point.  I'm 30.  On the dot.  Oh, man.  Not on the dot.  It's not your birthday today.  Well, I'm 30 in a matter of...  I'm 30 and a half.  30 print five.  That's right.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  No bag all the time?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What do you pull out usually?  I'll pull out from time to time.  Okay.  Why?  Oh, just for the fun of it?  Just because. 
[04:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, just because sometimes you've got to show them who's boss.  Right, right, right.  You've got to climb up to the pillow and aim right for that nose.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You can't all put it all in one spot all the time.  Establish your dominance.  That's right.  You pull out and you quickly do that crawl up to the pillow and you aim right for the bridge of the nose.  I haven't tried that one yet.  You aim right for the fucking hair.  The wacky, awkward little knee crawl.  Absolutely.  You've got to bob back on your way up to the pillow. 
[04:09:00]  That's what they Instagrammed.  A plate of meat.  That's our sandwiches being made.  Oh, wow.  They look terrific.  That's an amazing Instagram account.  Why are we not?  Leonie Heroes on Instagram.  They disappeared.  Well, the bosses said to get weighed.  When the bosses want the guys weighed, the guys get weighed.  It's on you because Wets get weighed.  It's on you, Jimmy.  Jimmy's demanding this.  Yeah.  You don't mind that responsibility, do you?  No.  Oh, look at the cup with two big pretzel sticks in it. 
[04:09:30]  It's my treat.  That's what you do.  That's a treat?  Uh-huh.  See, because he didn't want to eat the sandwich.  So he wants to eat something.  That's very smart.  Huh?  I don't think they're coming down to get weighed today.  No, they're too busy making out with their sandwiches.  They say, fuck you.  What?  The executive producer and the bosses say, come down, they come down.  Bosses said, yes. 
[04:10:00]  Jimmy wants this done today.  If the talent wants the segment to happen, I need to make sure it's going to happen.  Yeah, we want to happen.  All right.  You think they have totally given up on their diets?  Oh, yeah.  Dude.  Why?  They were both doing well.  I literally talked.  Roland was down like 25 pounds.  Yeah, but he was up five the last time.  And he already dipped back and threw five pounds back on in a week.  And every day has been a celebratory day for one reason or another.  Celebratory.  Celebratory. 
[04:10:30]  Celebratory.  It's celebratory.  I've heard it's celebratory.  It's celebratory.  It's celebratory.  Celebratory.  Can we make a list of all the celebrations rolling his head since losing 25 pounds?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's Groundhog Day at Pucks for Tony.  It's Tuesday.  Sam's going down the hall to see.  Tuesday.  This is Jimmy's thing.  Sam's little walk.  I don't feel like being blamed today.  Jimmy wants this done.  I want it done, too.  Why not?  I officially don't want it done. 
[04:11:00]  I want to see what they gained.  Oh, here's Iraq.  Oh, boy.  Here's the E.  Iraq.  Not today we didn't.  I know.  We don't need to keep doing this every week.  You're losing weight.  We're happy for you, dummy.  No, you're not.  Are you officially giving up on the diet?  No.  Well, I'm still doing smoothies and portion control.  German goulash.  My birthday. 
[04:11:30]  That sounds awesome.  It was great.  Of course it is.  Baked noodles and Jarlsberg cheese.  Him and his Jarlsberg cheese.  What does that taste like?  It's a really strong Swiss cheese.  Oh, I like a good Swiss.  That does sound good.  And then you have a crock pot cooking all day with stewed meat.  Oh.  Stewed meat.  Thick gravy.  Some noodles, thick gravy, and Jarlsberg cheese.  That does sound good. 
[04:12:00]  And sour cream and cucumbers.  What?  Yeah.  Why would you do that?  Sour cream and cucumbers.  You slice them really thin the night before.  And how do you make the brown sauce so thick, you think?  Yeah.  That can't be healthy.  A lot of butter and some fucking flour.  No.  Flour.  Flour.  Lots of flour, I would imagine.  Butter.  I can't remember the recipe.  It's beef stock and, you know, whatever, that gravy thickening.  Oh, that good stuff. 
[04:12:30]  Coagulated shite.  Throwing some ox tails.  It looks like Ajax.  You just dump it in.  Did you have one helping?  Yes.  That's not bad.  I had leftovers.  I can't imagine a gravy thicker.  A thickener, yeah.  Or thickener.  A gravy thickener is healthy.  You cook it very thin, and then at the end, you let it keep cooking without the lid on  it so it thickens up.  You put a little of the gravy thickener in the blender.  When do you add the Jarlsberg cheese? 
[04:13:00]  That's a separate process.  Can you look up what's in a gravy thickener?  I need to know.  Give me a label.  I bet it's kind of a flour, right?  Mixture.  Glucose-free?  Oh, good.  Gluten-free.  Oh, whatever.  Glucose-free.  It had something on it that said Glucose-free.  Glucose-free.  No, I want the nutritional stuff.  Corn starch.  That's what it is.  Yeah, it's all like starches.  It thickens it up.  A lot of starches.  A lot of starch.  It's adding starch to it. 
[04:13:30]  A lot of starch.  You add your starch.  Your gravy thickener.  Because these are all Jarlsberg cheese.  It's the best.  Yeah, because these are all like...  Oh, this might be...  Is this it?  No, it's not it.  It's a corn starch.  Yeah, it's just adding corn starch to it.  Yeah.  Wow.  Don't knock it until you try it.  Who knows?  Who's knocking it?  It sounds delicious.  Of course it sounds delicious.  I'm loving the way this sounds.  Slice the Jarlsberg real thin. 
[04:14:00]  After you cook the noodles, you put it on.  Oh.  And then you put noodles over it again and another layer.  Oh.  And let it...  You're making gravy lasagna.  And then you stir it up.  I bet you're going over there, though, and grabbing a slice of two of Jarlsberg just to  shove it in your mouth.  Get your hand off that Jarlsberg.  Stop.  We don't have enough Jarlsberg for the German...  For the German goulash.  Oh, my God.  Whatever's left over, you're making little tidbits with some Grey Poupons.  A little appetizer for later? 
[04:14:30]  It's got to go to waste.  It's great.  You're not going to throw it out.  You've got a little bit of chunk of Jarlsberg.  Well, it goes to waste any of you.  Can I ask a very honest...  It goes to waste legs, ass.  Your wife wants you to lose weight, right?  Yeah.  So why is she making this?  Because it was my birthday.  She's a very good woman, but occasionally people get a little...  Whenever you're dealing with someone, they get a little codependent sometimes in  some ways.  Did she ask you what you wanted for your birthday dinner? 
[04:15:00]  Yes.  She did.  And did she roll her eyes or anything when you said you wanted German goulash?  No, because it's what I usually have every year.  I'll have German goulash once again.  Every year.  So she didn't even need to ask.  She knows that's your favorite, so she was testing you.  Well, she was asking if maybe it would change this year.  No, it didn't.  She was hoping you would say grilled chicken over a salad.  The night before.  You know what, honey?  This year, maybe a salad.  Because as we both know, I'm trying to do the right thing here.  Yeah.  Dressing on the side, please. 
[04:15:30]  She was testing you.  Vegetable involved.  There was cucumbers.  Oh, well, there you go.  She was testing you, I think.  Nah.  She's just an old person.  Well, Jimmy, did you want some from him?  Because if it comes from me...  I want to see the way off.  Both of these guys, I was behind 100% losing the weight, and I was happy for you guys,  and I think you should continue doing it.  Well, here's the memo.  First, I've got to go fuck yourself from Roland.  Oh.  Then I've got to...  Why?  He's celebrating.  Roland was in on the bit.  Then I've got to...  We'll acknowledge that he's celebrating.  Sembratory.  Then I've got to...  By the way, this is his...  I appreciate it, but this is his celebration, not mine. 
[04:16:00]  True.  I'm enjoying it, but I did not...  Sure.  Order the sandwiches.  Initiate this.  For your third birthday meal.  Right.  Then I got a...  What do I get out of it?  Eric got $500.  Ah.  Then I got a...  I'll follow what Eric does.  Okay.  Oh.  All right.  Come on down, Roland.  Oh!  Oh, no.  Ro-Ro.  Look at Ro-Ro.  He's coming down the studio with a big hero in his left hand.  He's puffed out like a chipmunk. 
[04:16:30]  What's that?  He's...  Oh, God.  There he is.  My man.  Ro-Ro.  What sandwich?  Pepperoni.  It's just pepperoni and mozzarella.  It's like a pizza.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Is that a big, fucking, thick piece of mozzarella?  It's real pepperoni.  Grilled pepperoni.  At the invitation.  Grilled pepperoni.  Wait.  Big slice of fucking cheese.  It's real pepperoni.  So that's healthier?  Yeah.  It's not like the artificial flavors or anything. 
[04:17:00]  It's like from the bolognese in Italy.  And it's some French mozzarella they make at the Leone's.  Oh, they make it right there.  All these good boys.  And we all know cheese is healthy, so you're good there.  If it's done...  Mozzarella, feta, and parmesan are the healthy cheese.  It's all natural, pal.  Right.  It's all the natural cheese.  Sam, go ahead.  Well, Roland, you said you were behind Eric, whatever he wants to do.  No, I didn't say that.  I said it might be. 
[04:17:30]  No.  First, you said, go fuck yourself.  Right.  Which is fair.  Right.  Remember that.  No, for me.  I don't mean to everybody.  Second, you said, what do I get out of it?  Eric got 500 bucks.  Yeah.  And then third, you said, I'm behind Eric, whatever Eric wants to do.  I don't know the last part.  Eric has announced that he's prepared for a weigh-in.  All right, let Eric weigh in.  It's his birthday.  I don't want to take the thunder or the pounds away.  What's that sandwich? 
[04:18:00]  That looks damn good.  Oh, it's all good.  When we last left, Eric, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe you were 338 down from  three...  37.  I was at 10.  237.  That's what I meant.  Sorry.  237.  Yeah.  237.  If I have to weigh in, Dr., you're going to do backflips in a minute.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  All right, you were at 237, which is down 10 from the original weight.  What was the original weight?  247.  Okay.  At one point, he lost 11 pounds, and now he's down only 10 pounds. 
[04:18:30]  Okay, 10 pounds.  Well, Eric is officially in the maintaining phase.  237.  Nice.  Maintaining, maintaining.  But he hasn't put any on.  He hasn't put any on?  No.  And he was able to squeeze in some German gulags.  That's not bad.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well...  I got to think that Jarlsburg cheese isn't fat-free.  It's all natural.  It's all natural.  It's true.  As Obi says, I'm going to set this one out, boys. 
[04:19:00]  What?  I'm going to set this one out.  Oh, come on.  You said you're doing it.  Climb on board.  I'm not going to do it, sorry.  You don't want to climb on board?  I'll be sad.  Oh, you'll be sad.  I'm not even fucking with you.  It's okay to look at it and be sad, then just stop what you...  Like, you're in a place where you're kind of slipping back, and it happens.  It's a really hard...  It's a real hard one.  You can't tell him this while he's got a delicious sandwich.  No, but I'm saying...  I know it's fucking really hard.  I'm not saying it's easy.  It's very, very hard to do.  And this is where everybody trips up.  Like, everybody starts off okay.  No matter what, guys, I'm going to have a slice of cake. 
[04:19:30]  Oh, see?  He wants to have a slice of cake.  Did you just burp?  Yeah.  No.  You don't need it, man.  I know what you...  Hold this for me, Sam.  You don't need it, buddy.  Do it, Jimmy.  You're going out.  Pass up all this delicious food and have two shitty pretzels.  It's really hard to do.  I believe Roland, before the weigh-off, was 3-37, lost 24 down to 3-13, added 5 to 3-18.  Roland is in the maintaining phase.  Oh, Roland is 3-18.  There you go. 
[04:20:00]  Cake.  A little cake.  Cake time.  Are you going to celebrate?  No, I'm not.  You're not going to celebrate that you're in the maintaining stage?  Yes, Sugar Tits, I am.  I love this.  I don't know why I love this.  Because I got olive oil in here, too.  That's good.  Why is olive oil good?  Because it's in Dr. Eden's book.  I'm learning today.  I didn't know olive oil was good.  See, I'm going to put this down.  I would assume olive oil...  I'm going to take this back.  Can't be good for you unless it's a little bit. 
[04:20:30]  Yeah.  A little's good, right?  But...  It's so funny.  The maintaining phase is, like, way too early.  I know.  After, what, two weeks?  Whatever it was.  Yeah.  Eric's my sponsor.  Four weeks.  Eric's my sponsor.  Eric is very relieved, I can tell.  Oh, yeah.  He's so relieved.  He loves that he's maintained.  He's relieved.  Fuck it, I'm going to run around the block.  He loves the fact that he's squeezing some German goulash.  With what she...  With Jarlsberg.  But a good goulash is amazing. 
[04:21:00]  We all know that.  Yeah.  We all love goulash.  That's not the debate.  I bet that...  We're not debating that.  I bet that meat's very tender in that crock pot for that long, right?  It just falls apart.  It just falls apart, right?  What kind of meat?  Like some...  Braised beef.  Big beef.  Braised beef.  Yeah.  Whatever they use for stews.  Oh, so good.  And a ninja slow cooker.  That's the best.  Just get those juices in. 
[04:21:30]  There's a lot going on at that Nagel house.  Oh, boy.  A lot of gadgets.  They got all the appliances.  A lot of gadgets are on.  Sits right next to the Nutribullet.  Nutribullet's sad.  Oh, that's great.  You go, ah, a man who knows how to eat.  Yeah.  I bet you could whip up some good pancake batter in that Nutribullet.  Nice, light, light pancakes.  Oh.  Right?  I didn't think about that.  There you go.  So, what's the big plug?  Oh, it's Leone's from Brooklyn.  Okay. 
[04:22:00]  I was trying to remember where they're from.  Yeah, Leone's Heroes.  They're delicious.  Right.  Very cool.  Thanks to those guys.  Big support for the Opie Anthony show.  Their sandwiches are ridiculous.  They're delicious.  They're delicious.  That was pretty goddamn good.  And they got a good bread, too, which is the key.  I'm going to go back and maintain.  All right.  Keep maintaining, buddy.  Yeah.  As he walks out, he's a pepperoni and mozzarella sandwich and an iced coffee that looks like  it's heavy on the cream.  That is a light little iced coffee there.  That's a milky...  We've got to stop allowing the food in. 
[04:22:30]  Not that we can make him eat better, but we're pushing...  We're contributing to fucking Roland throwing himself off a cliff.  He's the one that makes the phone call.  No, no.  Dude, he's responsible.  Ultimately, he's responsible.  We're not ordering up sandwiches.  Is that even his birthday?  Nobody even asked for it.  We're still allowing him...  It's not his birthday.  If we told him we won't plug these guys on the air, no matter who they are from now  on...  Oh, it's not about plugging.  He don't care.  Dude, number one, we didn't plug the cake.  And number two, Eric asked for no cake.  Is the cake different?  Yeah.  Leone's doesn't make cakes. 
[04:23:00]  I want to fart on the cake so bad.  Why?  Ruin it for everybody?  I won't.  Fart cake.  Fart cakes are the worst.  I had one little taste of frosting.  It was a home run.  Oh, yeah.  Where's the cake from?  Because Roland only goes to the best places in New York.  You want me to plug it?  It's from Amy's Bread.  Oh, it's not pedestrian.  He loves Amy's Bread.  He loves it there.  He's a huge fan of Amy's Bread.  No, he doesn't do pedestrian.  No.  How big these sandwiches are.  I know.  They're giant sandwiches. 
[04:23:30]  I don't know.  I just have one little slice off of it.  Just a little taste.  That's it.  A little taste.  All right.  Let's get the plugs in and get the hell out of here.  Well, my big plugs are the Ontario-California Improv this Thursday through Saturday.  Virginia Beach, March 20th, 21st and 22nd.  Tampa for the Cowhead Roast, April 10th.  And then Sidesplitters, April 11th and 12th.  And April 24th through 27th is Caroline's here in New York. 
[04:24:00]  Nice.  All right, ladies and gents.  Do I have any words of wisdom?  No, you do not.  Wow.  What happened there?  I wonder what Chef Keith could do with some of these leftover sandwiches.  Yeah, he was fun, man.  Make sure you listen to the replay.  We got the guy on that did the fake cooking segments on the local news.  Pepperoni.  He was cool.  Oh, shit.  How bad would you...  I would love to eat that. 
[04:24:30]  It's all I want to do.  I want to eat that cake until I'm shitting cake.  I would get a little red sauce on the side to just dip that in.  Oh, right?  Yes.  Fuck, I would love to do it.  Oh, some sauce with that would be amazing.  It's like you're eating a pizza sandwich, definitely.  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  We've run out of steam, obviously, so we're going to call it for today.  Great show.  Thanks for listening.  That was fun.  And we'll see you all tomorrow.

He's trying to make me go to dinner with someone I don't want to go to dinner with.  Who is it?  You know, I'm keeping a mystery, I guess.  It is.  It's a mystery.  I'm not going to dinner with that guy.  No?  No.  That's too bad.  I didn't know you had hang-ups.  I don't have hang-ups.  I'm not going to dinner with that guy.  Everybody does have hang-ups here, Tim. 
[04:35:00]  We don't all have to get along.  Oh, yeah.  I think, uh...  It's too short.  I don't do crazy.  I don't do crazy either.  I know.  I was just quoting you.  I don't do crazy.

[04:35:30]  Yeah.  You do know they go late.  Why would you?  Yeah, they always go late.  I'm going to kill myself.  My wife went, uh...  Oh, I should know this.  Eleven days late, I think we were?  So you might have another...  No, don't say it.  You might have another three weeks.  Don't...  I do not have another three weeks.  I swear to God, you might have another three weeks.  I'll kill myself.  I'm doing everything in my power.  I'm trying to even bang every day.  It's not working.  When did it become not cool being pregnant?  Like a week ago.  Yeah, because it happens to every woman.  Yeah, like a week ago.  Like, they're so into it, around eight, eight and a half months, they start going, get 
[04:36:00]  this thing out of me.  It's not cool anymore.  Nicole from the morning mashup is here.  Yeah.  I'd go to dinner with her.  I'd go to dinner with you.  Why don't you...  We weren't talking to...  But Tim wants me to go to dinner with this person.  Why don't you want to go?  Because I...  It's nice of him to not invite you.  Because this person is not cool.  It was funny that...  And he makes things about himself.  Tim listed the participants of going to the dinner.  I wasn't feeling it.  And Opie listed the participants that he was willing to go to dinner with.  From that list, I will go with these people. 
[04:36:30]  That makes sense.  The list was only missing one person.  Yeah.  Sam, you gotta put out the word.  I can't do this anymore with these Sudokus.  Oh, I'm really...  It must be really tough being a celebrity.  Look...  Are you addicted to Sudoku?  No, everyone...  He sends out his stupid signed Sudokus to people on Twitter.  Oh, look at all these.  Really?  I'm hoarding them.  Look, I got like...  These aren't done yet.  You know what you do?  If somebody's like, hey...  I got four done here.  This is really nerdy of you.  Look at this.  I'm hoarding them.  Sudoku, I feel like you're years late on this.  You are.  I was doing that shit when I was in college. 
[04:37:00]  And as we all know, that was a long time ago at this point.  It was a goof.  And then one lousy person said, hey, can you sign that and send it to me?  I said, yeah.  All right.  Fine.  No problem.  My Twitter is littered with people asking every day now.  Opie used to do the Sudokus during the show.  Okay.  We don't have songs that we play during the show.  Right.  So there was a bit of irony in that because you shouldn't have time to do a Sudoku.  That's true.  He's since stopped really doing Sudokus while the show's on and is now bringing Sudokus  from home and signing them.  You're just feeding the haters, you idiot. 
[04:37:30]  These things take me minutes.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I have a math brain.  Do you?  Yeah.  You're a little genius.  I have no business being a broadcast.  I should have been a scientist.  For real?  So far, we've learned that Opie is so famous, he can't take it, and he should have been a  scientist.  Look it.  Learn something new on the show every day.  Or a doctor.  Whatever else you do with numbers.  I don't know.  You want a sandwich?  What are these sandwiches?  You're eating for two.  It's not a funny joke.  Your jokes are not funny anymore.  No.  I've been there a couple times.  I know where...  What, Rollins?  Do you want to... 
[04:38:00]  I have a question really quickly.  I'm sorry.  Are you...  Were you really afraid to...  When you had a girl to, like, clean her vagina?  It's really strange.  Matt's really afraid of that.  That's like his biggest fear.  He's like really afraid of duty in there.  Yeah.  Well, duty does get in there.  Yeah.  And it's really strange at first, but then you just...  I don't know.  Then you'll do anything for your kids.  So what are you going to do?  Just asking.  I feel like, yeah, it seems like if it's your kid's vagina and your kid's duty, it's different.  I just wish someone would have told me years ago that someday you'll be cleaning vaginas. 
[04:38:30]  I had no idea.  Yeah.  I just assumed that would never happen.  I mean, you wouldn't even think about it.  Of course not.  Like, it wouldn't even occur to you that it could, might or might not happen.  Right.  It's just a given that I would never be in a situation where I'm cleaning shit out of...  I mean, Jim Norton can't say that.  The thought never...  But beyond Jim...  The thought never entered my mind.  Right.  And then all of a sudden I'm in there and you've got to make sure it's clean because, you know,  you guys got some things going on down there.  Yes, we do. I know.  I know.  You've got some things going on.  Yeah.  It's complicated.  You've got to get in all those crevices. 
[04:39:00]  You don't want any bacteria in there, Sam.  It sounds...  Yeah.  See, to me it sounds gross, but I'm assuming if it were my kid...  It's really strange.  Okay.  Even if it's your kid.  But he'll be all right.  All right.  Even, like, the first time you did it for your own kid, it was still strange?  It's really strange, yeah.  Okay.  Now I really want that sandwich.  I mean, nothing makes me hungrier.  Than shitty vaginas?  Than shitty vaginas.  I get that.  Yeah.  I can't wait for Nicole to experience motherhood.  Dude, they are so afraid.  Of what?  Of the morning mashup. 
[04:39:30]  Of all the jokes they did before they...  No, that's it.  Oh, what?  I meant to...  So we...  Don't play a part if it's before, right?  It doesn't...  How long does it stay in your blood for?  Because...  No.  You really have nice eyes when they're not all, you know...  Bloodshot?  Classy and bloodshot.  Thank you, O.  Yeah.  It's a good idea.  We've been trying to...  We're not used to seeing...  We're not used to seeing your eyes so clear.  I know.  We've been trying to figure out why pregnancy works for you so well.  Yeah.  And then, I mean, it's because you're sober.  It's about partying.  Right. 
[04:40:00]  Because you're not coming in.  Are you jonesing for a little partying?  Yeah.  Are you really?  Bad.  Really?  Just to feel normal again.  Just to socialize, you know?  Are you going to breastfeed?  Yes.  Oh, fuck.  So you can party for another...  I'm aware.  Almost another year.  Almost.  She's getting that dick again, though.  Yeah.  She did not get the dick for a while, but they started having sex again, correct?  Yes, we did.  It's good stuff.  Feeling better?  Feeling better.  Yeah.  You didn't gain a pound in your face.  Thank God.  Or your arms.  Let's look at the rest of you here.  Yeah.  Strip.  From behind.  From behind, the ass looks really good. 
[04:40:30]  Okay, good.  I was hoping for that.  Which it didn't before, so let's take a look.  Yeah, it actually might have added a little...  Yeah.  A little meat.  A little roundness to it.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  A little structure.  Yeah.  No, you did all right, man.  Thank you so much, O.  I feel bad.  You're more than all right.  You look great.  Thank you, O.  I feel like your whole show just got shot to shit, Sam.  No, it didn't, because when Opie's here, if Opie wasn't here, they would be making me  play clips.  And now people got to figure out the mystery, uh...  The mystery person?  For the date thing.  Not date.  Mystery, uh...  Was it a guy or a girl? 
[04:41:00]  It's a guy.  Yeah.  I think people could probably figure it out pretty easily.  Guy?  That makes it all about him.  Yeah.  I think people are not going to have the toughest time in the world.  I want to know who it is.  I don't...  I can't figure it out.  He's making hand gestures.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I'm nervous.  Tim's outside.  It's all about him.  Waiting to continue on the meeting.  Except this one guy.  And Tim wants me to go to dinner with him.  Oh, wow.  A lot of anger.  Yeah.  Tim just has the best intentions, you know? 
[04:41:30]  Tim's like the nicest guy ever.  I, like, love Tim Sabine.  He's jolly.  He's happy.  He's sweet.  You don't be just...  Don't shit on him.  Don't say jolly.  I think he's jolly.  But that implies he's fat.  No, I don't think jolly implies fat at all.  You can't be jolly and thin.  I just feel like he's, like, an overly happy person that always walks around happy.  That's why he's fat.  Before you were pregnant.  Yeah.  If I was like, yeah, Nicole's always so jolly.  I wouldn't think you were calling me fat.  Well, you're kind of a bimbo, though.  So, most people would.  Let's go to Keith in New Jersey. 
[04:42:00]  What's up, Keith?  Hey, what's up, Sam?  I wonder if you had a WWE ticket today to give away.  What, do you want to go to Madison Square Garden on Saturday?  I'd love to.  All right.  Well, then you're going, buddy.  Yay!  Awesome.  Thank you.  You see that?  All right.  I'm going to put you on hold.  The phone screener can come in here and get the winner sheet to get your information.  And, Nicole, the thing that people have to remember...  Yeah.  ...is that if you want the latest happenings in WWE or to see when WWE will be in your area,  you have to visit WWE.com forward slash events for tour dates. 
[04:42:30]  Just something to keep in mind.  All right.  It's there.  It's in my mind now.  Yeah.  Thanks.  John in Georgia wants some clarification.  John?  Yeah.  I need some clarification there.  The greatest broadcaster ever, Sam Roberts.  That's accurate.  Oh, and Opie, if he's there.  He's not.  Oh, okay.  Thank God.  Yeah, all right.  Well, we know that Nicole is having sex now, as she says.  Yeah.  But are you having sex with your husband, or are you having a morning mash-up freeway? 
[04:43:00]  No, no, no, no.  That would never happen.  That's actually quite unappetizing.  I love those boys, but no, with my husband.  And really only from behind, because there's no other way to do it.  Doggy?  Oh.  Not full doggy.  I just kind of lie to my side in a fetal position.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  So you're saying that the morning mash-up guys that you work with are just so repulsive,  you'd never even think of everything.  I didn't say that.  You said that.  Right.  I think you said that.  Look, they obviously just don't translate sex.  Have you heard the show?  It's not exactly exuding sexual energy in the morning. 
[04:43:30]  It's not sexy.  Plus, they see Nicole come in before she puts her makeup on, which I've seen a couple times.  It's not pretty.  It's a different story.  A little scary.  So, yeah, it's just in the fetal position on the side.  Okay, I just was exaggerating a little bit.  But, I mean, I tried to go on top, and it was just that the belly's just so big, and  then he has to look at it, and then he doesn't think sex when he sees the belly.  Because that's his child.  Right.  Or he hopes.  Yes, it is his child.  Yeah, so is it him, or do you not like being on top and looking down and seeing your belly? 
[04:44:00]  I'm just trying to be nice.  I don't think, I mean, he hasn't said, let's not do this.  It's just, you know, logistically, it's just easier.  You're just trying to be accommodating.  I'm just trying to be accommodating.  I'm just trying to be a good wife.  You're such a good person, is the thing.  Murray in Tallahassee.  Murray.  Murray.  Hey, Nicole, just to let you down a little bit.  Once you have your baby, and then y'all just partying, you can't wait to get out of your  system.  Yeah.  The baby still has to get up, and it is such a rude awakening.  My wife and I could not wait on our first one. 
[04:44:30]  And so we go out, get a babysitter, come home, when we finally decide to do that, and three  o'clock in the morning feeding, whatever time your baby gets up.  It hurts way worse.  Yeah.  What are you going to, I mean, you're going to, are you going to have hungover mornings  where baby doesn't understand that mommy has her own thing going on?  Listen, I don't think I can really go back to the old, old ways ever.  Wow.  But, which is sad, but it's okay.  We're saying goodbye.  But I, I mean.  It's probably healthier.  Yeah.  It's probably, it's probably for the best.  Probably won't worry about you as much.  Probably not. 
[04:45:00]  Yeah.  Um, but yeah, yeah.  I mean, I don't think, I don't think there's going to be like no sleeping, like blacked  out nights anymore, but I'm, you know, a few too many glasses of wine.  You can celebrate every now and then.  Right.  Roland and E-Rock, we're just talking about that today.  Roland likes to celebrate with a good sandwich.  I see that.  Roland and E-Rock are so funny.  They've, you know, they were having this weight loss challenge for a while.  Right.  They have now, uh, both, they didn't lose much weight.  They gained a little back.  But in the last four days, they haven't lost any, they haven't gained or lost any weight. 
[04:45:30]  Okay.  So they've both decided they're in maintaining phase right now.  That's not maintaining until you log, you've got to get your goal to maintain phase.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  You are on your diet, correct?  Yes.  But as, so on your diet, as long as you're not gaining weight, you're good.  It's successful.  All right.  See, that's called having, Nicole, say it with me, a positive attitude.  Right.  Positive attitude.  Yes.  Okay.  And E-Rock, you're going to lose weight from that positive attitude, aren't you?  Oh, I sure am.  Or at least maintain. 
[04:46:00]  At least maintain.  That's good stuff.  But I thought Roland only lost like 20 pounds.  He has a lot more to go.  Roland lost 24 pounds.  Yeah.  Gained five.  Oh, Jesus.  So he lost 15.  And is now, no, that's not.  I'm not making sure.  Sorry.  That's very bad math.  No, yeah.  He's lost 19 pounds.  Jeez.  And is maintaining now.  Which is good.  He's maintaining.  And I just got a text from Roland.  Oh, no.  It says, Nicole is fat.  Yes.  I am.  I am fat.  And I am the first to admit it, Roland. 
[04:46:30]  So are you.  Wow.  I love you, though.  You do.  You love everybody.  I want him to be healthy more than anything.  And that's not healthy.  No.  His maintenance weight he thinks he's at is not healthy.  No.  He could be the best role that he can be, but he's not trying.  Is your husband okay with you partying less?  Yeah.  He loves it.  He said he never wants me not to be pregnant again.  Right.  Because he doesn't have to worry about you anymore.  Right.  He just gets you to sit at home.  And, like, there's a baby attached to you.  So what are you going to do?  Exactly.  Like, if you cheat on your husband while very pregnant, you're, like, the worst person ever. 
[04:47:00]  Like, that's pornography.  Yeah.  But, I mean, he has not changed his ways in any way, shape, or form.  No.  He's an animal.  He's still partying.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Well, he can, right?  He's not pregnant.  He doesn't have a baby attached to him.  Is he going to breastfeed?  No.  So?  Why not?  They do have those things for men to wear.  Yeah, but they're not, they don't take the milk out of the man.  Like, I'm pretty sure you could still do whatever you want to do.  That's true.  You know, just strap it on.  Right.  It's a strap-on. 
[04:47:30]  That's what it is.  It's going to use a strap-on.  It's a titty strap-on.  Right.  Exactly.  E-Rock, let's hear Line of the Day today.  All right.  Here comes Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  She looked hot tied up on that tree, though.  Lupita.  Fucking ass.  I think you missed the point of the film, man. 
[04:48:00]  Oh, my God.  Why was that the Line of the Day?  Oh, you are a bad person, Eric.  Why would you repeat that?  Of all the possible lines, that's the one you picked?  Oh, it was funny?  No.  Not funny at all.  Jim's was funny.  He missed the point of the movie.  Norton's was funny.  Jim Norton's saying, I think you missed the point of the movie.  I'm disgusted, right?  You know what he was talking about?  Yes.  Oh, you saw the film?  No, I don't need to see the film to know exactly what he was talking about.  I know the gist of the film.  You can guess, though.  Would you like me to do an alternate version?  Give me an alternate version of Line of the Day, because you upset Nicole, and she's 
[04:48:30]  expecting.  Here comes the Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Line of the Day.  Little Beavis drops his cat toys on my face at night.  She wants to play.  You know what she calls his balls?  Yes.  Little cat toys.  See how much better Nicole feels now, Eric?  That was amazing.  Much better, right?  Oh, that warmed my heart. 
[04:49:00]  Little tiny kitten balls on Anthony's face.  I love that.  Terrific.  It's a great visual.  A lot of questions coming in.  A lot of people trying to get to the bottom of stuff here on the post show.  Obie was here a few minutes ago.  Now Nicole, the very pregnant Nicole from the morning mashup, is sitting in.  And we go to Rick in New Mexico.  Hello, Rick.  Hey, what's going on, Sam?  How's it going?  It's going pretty good.  Hey, according to the show, Nicole has very large, luscious breasts.  I hope this baby doesn't plan on ruining them. 
[04:49:30]  I think they're ruined no matter what.  Are they?  Yeah, but it's okay.  I'll just get new ones if I have to eventually.  So is that what happens after you get pregnant?  Regardless, they're going to get ruined?  I think they end up like tube socks.  Oh, no.  Eventually.  And it might not happen to everybody, but I'm trying to keep them in tip-top shape.  Right.  Do you do breast exercises, or what do you do?  Yeah, I mean, I try to exercise a little bit, and I try to wear bras to bed so it keeps them up.  Oh, does that work?  I mean, an old wives' tale.  I guess so.  Yeah.  But if need be, the fans need to know. 
[04:50:00]  Yeah.  If you realize they're just not what they were, you will get them.  I'll get fake ones, and I will let you know when I'm getting them.  Good.  All right, Nicole.  You're great.  Yeah.  This is why people love you so much.  Yeah.  Because you're not going to disappoint your public.  Never.  I would never even dream of it.  By the way, I do think it's funny that Sirius XM is in such a panic over you not being on  the morning mashup, that they've built a studio in your house.  They have.  So that you can still broadcast, because they're like, there's no way those other three guys  can carry that show.  In my kitchen.  I hope that's not what they think. 
[04:50:30]  Of course it's what they think.  Why would they build a studio in your house?  Yeah.  Why would they jump into your maternity leave saying you're still going to work?  Because we're a team.  What?  There's four people on this show.  You don't think that three are supposed to be able to carry it, but they can't?  Oh, God.  You guys are so mean.  Well, no.  It's a very nice thing to say to you.  It's just, you know, you need a little, um, what's not, um, not testosterone.  What's the other one?  Broadcast talent.  Estrogen.  Yeah, you need a little estrogen in the room.  Oh, Eric had it.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  They can't just bounce off the weather guy the whole time.  You're so going to hell. 
[04:51:00]  That's Eric, not me.  Joe in Louisville.  Hey, Nicole.  Did you hear early last week?  Howard Stern was trashing you on his show.  Yeah.  And how you're stupid.  Yeah.  Joe.  Yeah.  Well, he was just.  We do a morning show, too.  You could listen to this one.  Oh, I do.  I listen to both.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  I just want to say, hey, hey, hey, that guy Larry, he's going to end up crashing his  truck on the side of the road when he finds out his own son is gay, and that would be  funny, wouldn't it?  All right.  You do listen to both.  I appreciate that, Joe.  Thank you.  All right. 
[04:51:30]  Stern was making fun of you?  Yeah.  Nicole versus Streets.  Everyone makes fun of me.  It's not just Howard.  It's every person here and in life.  Right.  But that's the whole point of doing it.  Right.  I understand.  I'm not always so bright.  I say stupid things sometimes.  But that's the idea.  If you were bright, you wouldn't be doing it.  Exactly.  Plus, you know what?  Can I tell you something that I think?  Because I've done a lot of radio.  Yeah.  And watched a lot of professional wrestling.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think you're trying very hard to answer those questions correctly.  I don't want to spoil anything for anybody.  But I don't think you're going out of your way to study.  You don't think I'm giving it my all?  I don't think so.  Okay. 
[04:52:00]  No, I think you're okay giving it up to the streets every now and then.  It's your opinion.  I'm not saying you're a rocket scientist.  No.  Science.  A scientist.  You either.  You're not a rocket scientist.  You either, Sam.  Maybe not.  But I am saying sometimes you give the streets an easier time than you need to.  Snowy.  Snowy.  Snowy.  Look at your name.  Hey, Samuel.  How are you doing, sir?  Good.  The question I have, is their feet looking any better?  I mean, Opi said her a bunch better.  Unfortunately, they're still very long, but they've gotten very, very fat.  They've not got fat. 
[04:52:30]  Don't lie.  A lot of weight has gone to her feet.  And I don't know why that happens.  It's a lie.  But all the food that the baby's not eating has gone straight to her feet.  And it's repulsive.  Coke Logic texted me.  He's a regular.  He wants to know if you are going to record your labor for the Opie and Anthony show.  Would you like me to?  There could be some sounds there.  Sure.  Why not?  Good sound bites, right?  What do you do?  You got a studio in your house now?  You know what you should do?  What?  They built a studio in your house, right?  You should give birth in your bathtub like Ricky Lake and broadcast it live. 
[04:53:00]  Never going to happen.  We will carry it.  No, not going to happen.  I don't think Tim Sabian will allow that, number one.  All right, we'll do it on Hits 1 then.  I think Hits 1 won't allow that either.  We'll play songs in between.  I will see if we can get some sound bites from the hospital if you want.  We'll be like, okay, how far are your contractions or whatever?  You're like, they're about 30 minutes in between each one.  Good.  We'll play 10 songs, come back, another contraction.  10 songs.  Ah!  That's a little sad one.  And then go back to the...  It'll be the greatest thing Hits 1 has ever done.  I'm not so sure about that.  I don't know. 
[04:53:30]  E-Rock, do you have a clip of the day today?  I do.  There's me and Travis today.  All right, let me hear yours.  All right.  Mine is here.  Chef Keith Gerke is here, author of Locked Over's Rights, making a winner of last night's dinner.  I'm self-talking.  I did not go to culinary school, and I'm kind of unorthodox.  People compare...  Are you familiar with G.G. Allen?  G.G. Allen?  He threw his own shit at the audience.  He shoved bananas up his ass and shitted out into the ground. 
[04:54:00]  Oh, I kick it enough of the local news getting hammered.  G.G. Allen.  G.G. Allen.  This guy's brilliant.  He's the G.G. Allen of leftovers.  Are you familiar with G.G. Allen?  I'm not following.  He's a punk artist, G.G. Allen.  Kind of a do-it-yourself guy.  He didn't have a big label behind him.  Gotcha.  But he would play music for people, and while he was on stage, he would take shits and throw  them at people, and just really have the most vulgar show anybody's ever seen. 
[04:54:30]  Oh, that is nasty.  You didn't see this video then?  No.  Not aware.  It was this guy, and he went on the news pretending to be a chef.  Okay.  Like, he said, I have a chef book about what you can do with your Thanksgiving leftovers.  Okay.  And all these local news stations in, like, Nebraska and Wyoming and places like that brought  him on their show.  Okay.  But the book didn't exist.  Oh, dear.  He just designed a cover.  Oh, no. 
[04:55:00]  And then, he didn't, he wasn't a chef at all.  Right.  One of the ideas that he had on the news, on the local news, was to put mashed potatoes  in an ice cream cone, but put gravy in first.  So, take the ice cream cone, pour room temperature gravy in, and then put a scoop of mashed potatoes  on top, and use corn-like sprinkles.  Is it wrong that I think that sounds amazing right now?  I mean, maybe you're very pregnant.  That sounds awesome.  That's a great idea.  I think, well, you end up with an ice cream cone just with gravy in it. 
[04:55:30]  I know.  No.  It wouldn't mix.  No.  I like it.  I like it.  You would just drink gravy out of an ice cream cone?  Oh, my God.  I just want it right now.  No, you could always do that thing like you do with an ice cream cone where you, like,  bite the bottom so you could suck out some of the gravy.  Oh, that's great.  So, take some of the potatoes.  Oh, that's gross.  That sounds good.  And then, like, he put a whole bunch of other leftovers in a blender.  I mean, try to do it.  Like, ham.  That's disgusting.  Peas.  Mashup ham, something pureed ham sounds like there's nothing more violently disgusting.  It was great.  You should watch the video.
