<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment where Earl pitched a radio show idea, "The Black Rock Show," celebrating black artists in rock music. This sparked a discussion about genre definition and representation, quickly devolving into racist and sexist jokes from the hosts and callers.  Examples of artists mentioned included Jimi Hendrix, Lenny Kravitz, and Fishbone.  This was followed by an in-studio interview with Nikki Sixx of Mötley Crüe, promoting his book "The Heroin Diaries." Sixx discussed his heroin addiction, attributing it to childhood trauma, and his subsequent recovery.  He shared anecdotes about Mötley Crüe's history and excesses, creating humorous moments.  Following Sixx's interview, Howie Mandel joined the show in-studio.  Mandel, also discussing his struggles with OCD, joked with Sixx about their shared recovery experiences and their proximity in their shared Hidden Hills neighborhood (alongside Ozzy Osbourne and Alex Van Halen). The conversation then shifted to a discussion about physical altercations, with hosts and callers recounting (often jokingly) incidents of hitting women, and delving into the concept of a "goon hand."

Later in the broadcast, a struggling addict called in, prompting a return to the serious discussion of addiction. This transitioned into a segment focused on “Lady Di,” a recurring guest who was now homeless and visibly struggling with substance abuse.  Her friend, Marion, was also in-studio.  The hosts, along with Marion, Patty (a former homeless person), and "Club Soda" Kenny, attempted to persuade Lady Di to enter rehab.  Frank from a Yonkers detox center offered a place, and Jim from Brooklyn, who had previously tried to help Lady Di, also participated. Ben, another in-studio guest, volunteered to drive her.  Lady Di repeatedly resisted, prompting heated exchanges, interruptions, and insults, particularly from Marion, whom the hosts frequently silenced.  Throughout this segment, the hosts and guests expressed disbelief and frustration at Lady Di's excuses.  The discussion briefly veered into a discussion about pit bulls, including calls from owners and a news report about an attack, and a humorous segment about Paul McCartney and Heather Mills’ contentious separation, featuring jokes about Mills' prosthetic leg.  The show concluded with ongoing efforts to arrange help for Lady Di.  Throughout the entire broadcast, offensive language and discussions of offensive topics were frequent.

O.B. and Anthony Show, 93.3 K-Rock.  started working here i believe black was represented on your we had the black tops 
[00:05:00]  yeah but people gotta understand this guy even wears like black underwear black socks how do  you know because he shows us look there he's showing us again everything's black on the guy  is that a statement you're making we never really delved into that i like the color you like the  color black is beautiful right sure so earl i didn't tell anthony yet but what is your show  idea earl let me just ask you what you want on this radio flaming arrow stanton island thank you 
[00:05:30]  don't sugarcoat it tell anthony just like you told me what as i told you in confidence  oh why because you feel someone else might steal this idea no just this very reason earl if you  would share that with uh our audience for lack of a better word sort of a black rock show black rock  show it's a black rock black rock show so what what's a brief description of a black rock show  all right well that's going back a little it's going back i mean i found my dream yeah 
[00:06:00]  those are fats fats domino i was getting confused with uh chubby checker who figured out a million  ways to milk the twist come on baby let's do the twist next year the twist again like we did last 
[00:06:30]  summer i'm twisting out the unemployment line there's a million different twists so he wants  to do a black rock show anthony all right a black rock show now uh that would be a a rock show featuring  black black artists yes all right so i could think of uh two black rock artists after living color  where do you go you may want to help me after like living color and jimmy hendrix 
[00:07:00]  ah there you go hendrix oh lenny kravitz okay lenny kravitz we almost have a rock block and then  we're back to uh living color right i think you could play uh the thompson twins i think one of  them was black robert cray okay all right robert cray there you go earl who would you who would be the  core artist of your black rock yeah radio show core artist i mean obviously hendrix would be a core  artist we said that uh 
[00:07:30]  all right uh oh look at this jay from nutley checking in fishbone fishbone all right fishbone 
[00:08:00]  there you go all right so far uh opie and i and the audience have come up with more bands than  you who else besides hendrix fishbone and the others we see i think when you think of rock you  kind of particularly with black artists you kind of it's kind of narrow in its definition we would  just kind of stretch out the definition and include white people no no let's know what do you mean by  no whitey what do you mean by stretching out the definition i'm sure you sat down and thought this 
[00:08:30]  out right right absolutely some of farrakhan's reggae songs from before he uh no no not at all i mean  this just is this how the pitch is going to sound earl because you got to work i wrote it all it's  all written down all right i would love to read that you have the boss's ears right now because  they listen to our show every day and they're scared of black people so you got a man it's in  in the office when you play uh iced tea is that considered like a rock you can cover rap you  get into hip-hop well you cover hip-hop you cover jazz you can cover blues you can cover 
[00:09:00]  i mean the definition gets very will you call yourself vin skelsa  all right of course some money money would work yeah there you go absolutely all right anyone else  you could think of in the rock genre i mean don't you belong to an organization yes what is this  organization the black rock coalition the black rock coalition stop you know why the blacks have gone

[00:11:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I feel all of the things I've done for you.  Oh, Lordy, Lord.  Oh, Lordy, Lord.  I saw your champagne with roses,  and diamonds on your finger.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, Lordy, Lord.  Oh, Lordy, Lord.  Party all the time. 
[00:12:00]  Hussah! Hussah! Hussah! Hussah!  Shut up. Shut up.  Hopi, I have the Black Rock Coalition website.  Okay.  Earl, this sounds a little angry coming from the likes of you.  What is the Black Rock Coalition?  You are indeed a member?  Do you do admit that?  I'm a member.  Yes, yes.  Okay, that's all I ask.  Hopi, the Black Rock Coalition is a nonprofit organization  dedicated to achieving creative emancipation, 
[00:12:30]  economic parity,  administrative access,  and historical correction for black musicians.  Damn, Earl.  Particularly those who have been perpetually,  perpetually marginalized by the music industry.  The BRC represents the vanguard of artists,  irrespective of genre,  devoted to pushing black music and culture  to the next evolutionary phase. 
[00:13:00]  Hallelujah.  We got some clips from their leader.  Stay out the bushes.  He doesn't like bush, I guess.  Stay out the bushes.  Oh, man, we got another song that Earl could play on his Black Rock show.  All right, good.  I got it from a Negro. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, Lordy, Lord.  Oh, Lordy, Lord.  Get down, get down.  Yeah.  This rocks.  Get down, get down.  Get down, get down.  Get down, get down.  Excuse me while I whip this house.  Get down, get down.  Get down, get down. 
[00:14:00]  All right.  Earl, would your show have any features?  Uh, you know, like we've all heard two for Tuesday  or get the lead out or, yeah, five o'clock funnies, rock blocks.  I mean, I wrote this thing a couple months ago,  so I wouldn't really, I don't even remember what all the features were.  Yeah.  Did you have features?  Mm-hmm.  I'm sure our listeners could come up with some features for your.  Oh, no.  For your Black Rock show.  Oh, no.  Why? 
[00:14:30]  Oh, no.  What's the problem, man?  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I got a few black artists for you.  Yeah?  How about Michael Jackson?  Yeah, would he make the cut for your Black Rock show?  That's a good question.  That's actually a very good question.  That's a good question.  Do you consider him black?  But Earl, if you're going to call, like, Black Rock, I mean, you got to rock.  And it will do that.  How about the guy from Hootie and the Blowfish?  Yeah, does he get in?  A good example would be the Bad Brains.  Bad Brains, okay. 
[00:15:00]  They rocked as hard as anybody.  How about Prince?  Prince, definitely.  How about 24-7 Spies?  Absolutely.  How about what's his name?  I think Jimmy Hazel, the guitar player, listens to this very show.  Ah, there you go.  You're missing a key band, Seven Dust.  Seven Dust.  Seven Dust with rock on a Black Rock show.  I'm looking at the Black Rock Coalition's definition of what is rock.  Yeah.  It says just about everything.  Everything is here.  Blues, swings, spirituals, jump songs, pop standards, jazz. 
[00:15:30]  It was commonly referred to as race music by whites and was thus frowned upon by the largest society.  Earl, would white people be allowed to listen to this show?  Absolutely.  Current members?  Of the BRC.  If I may call it the BRC, Earl, may I?  Absolutely.  Thank you.  Black Rock Coalition.  Let's see.  Vernon Reed.  Good friend.  And Corey Glover.  There you go. 
[00:16:00]  Don Byron.  Yeah, great jazz clarinet player.  All right.  Nona Hendrix, spelled with a D-R-Y-N.  Yeah, she was in LaBelle.  Okay.  Will Calhoun.  Drummer for Living Color.  Bernie Worrell.  Bernie Worrell was in, he was part of the P-Funk All-Stars.  Greg Tate.  He writes for The Voice.  And Brian Neal of the Busboys.  Busboys, yeah.  Bill Stephanie.  He was one of the co-founders of Def Jam Records.  All right.  There you go. 
[00:16:30]  It doesn't get much wider than this song.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, what is this?  Is he playing dueling band, James?  Oh, yeah.  This is a good one.  This fits into the Black Rock Coalition.  Yeah, sure does.  Mike brings up a good point.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  What's up, my boys?  Hey.  This is Mookie.  All right, Mookie.  What do you got for us today?  All right.  Tell Black Earl that if he wants to expand his genre, then he can play the Black Crows and  Black Sabbath. 
[00:17:00]  Hey, there you go.  Would you play bands that have black in the title?  No.  No?  Oh, God.  Why not?  Like, or in the title of the song, like Black Dog by Zeppelin.  There you go.  That would open it up.  What about Milli Vanilli?  No.  No?  No Milli Vanilli?  No.  How about Sly in The Family Stone?  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, there you go.  With those huge-ass sunglasses he used to wear.  With the big fro.  With the big fro.  Fifth Dimension? 
[00:17:30]  Marilyn McCoo and Billy Davis Jr.?  The Neville Brothers?  Yeah, Neville.  I could play Neville, yeah.  All right.  And you don't remember the features or anything?  Not off the top of my head, no.  All right.  Liar.  Word.  What are you, liar?  You're a lion.  I'm not lying.  What would one of the features be?  Come on, Earl.  You know, featured album.  Featured album or...  Featured album?  I don't know.  It'll have it off your top of my head.  All right.  I think it sounds like a good idea.  It's something that... 
[00:18:00]  Can I tell you something, Anthony?  Yeah.  If Earl was on these airwaves every weekend doing a black rock show, I would be listening  every week.  I'd listen.  Believe me.  Believe you me.  I just want to hear Earl do live reads for Popeyes.  What?  What?  Decon for him.  Instead of doing live reads for a stack or two, it'd be crack.  Oh, Jesus, Opie.  Oh.  What?  That's horrible.  Poor band just jumped out the window.  It's all right as long as you ring the bell, right? 
[00:18:30]  Of course.  Character.  Character.  Well, the listeners are coming up with features for your black rock show, Earl.  Kevin, what's going on?  Yeah, I got a little gimmick for Earl's show.  Okay.  Instead of whipping out Wednesdays, they could have put a little Thursdays.  Oh.  Jesus.  Now, of course...  Yeah, you got to get a little funky with your girl.  That's one of the little lines, Opie. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  When you ask a girl to put a little n*** in it, it doesn't have...  It's not really a bad thing.  No.  No.  How about minstrel singers?  Oh.  No?  What?  Al Jolson?  Mammy.  Mammy.  How I love you.  How I love you.  My dear old mammy.  You know?  It could be in Blackface or something like that, right?  Al Jolson.  Every Friday.  What?  Blackface.  Oh, my...  That's bad.  Ring the bell. 
[00:19:30]  Amos and Andy, if you want to go talk, you can do Teen Week.  You're going to have to find a lot of babysitters, but you can still do Teen Week.  What?  Nick, what's going on?  You say Jew.  Hey, fellas.  I'm on my way down to Hot 97 station right now.  I want to start a new thing called the White Rap Coalition.  You think it'll be a big hit or what?  Try to get white rock music on Hot 97.  Yeah, white rap.  It'll go over just as well as his black rock will go over.  All right.  Thank you.  All right. 
[00:20:00]  F him.  All right.  Don't be discouraged, Earl.  I think it's a good idea.  Tell you the truth.  I would listen.  I would listen.  I can't read that one.  What?  Oh, yeah.  So hand it to me.  Will the invisible man be doing the news?  Hey, that's funny.  That's a nice obscure reference.  And now the weather and...  I'm the invisible man.  That's good.  Got to give Jay from Yonkers the credit on that line. 
[00:20:30]  Wow.  Oh, my God.  You guys can't read that.  All right.  I'll read it, but get your bell ready.  And, Earl, I apologize ahead of time.  Hogan from the City.  Instead of busting on Opie for pumpkin picking, we can pick on Earl for watermelon picking.  Oh, stop.  See, now that's just...  That's blatant old-fashioned stereotype.  I'm sorry.  You know, sorry you had to hear that.  That's not right.  Jesus.  Eric on line seven, I believe, has an idea for a feature. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  Let's go to Eric.  Eric, what's going on?  What's up, ONA?  Listen, I got a nice little entertainment feature for black girls.  All right.  Good.  You can help them out.  They could do it maybe like 8.15 in the morning or then move it around, but they could do  this day in crime.  Jesus, man.  Or like the day Rick James was convicted of, you know, like whatever, whatever.  Right.  You know, or they could do a roll call and they could, you know, have inmates, you know,  put in their serial numbers for their, you know, for their jail time.  Like a lottery type thing where you submit your jail numbers? 
[00:21:30]  There you go.  There you go.  What about Rick James, Earl?  Would he fit into the format?  Um, little Rick James.  Under my radar, barely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, Hammer?  Is this Hammer or Rick James?  Rick James?  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  I think we have the remix.  She's a very kicky girl.  Ah!  Don't get kicked in my mind. 
[00:22:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I can't believe he had sex with Linda Blair.  Jesus, that upsets me. 
[00:22:30]  I thought you liked him all by law.  Huh?  I thought you liked him all by law.  She's all right.  She's all right.  She's all right.  Jesus.  She's all right.  There you go.  Rick James, maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe if you're doing a special on like, uh, more of the, uh, the 80s type thing.  70s Motown.  70s.  Oh, Motown.  So all the Motown guys.  All the sax stuff.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Let's go.  Marvin Gaye?  Absolutely.  All right.  Let's go to Jerry. 
[00:23:00]  Jerry, what's up?  Oh, put us on an hour for the all-afro hour.  You can have all the, uh, all the singers with afros coming on.  All right.  Have a good one.  Thank you, Jerry.  Dan for Yonkers.  How about the 11 o'clock, uh, wake-up call?  The 11 a.m.  Wake-up call for all the brothers.  Cowbell Bill.  Yo, what's up, boys?  Hey, Bill.  What's up, man?  We're shaking.  All right.  Hey, uh, I got an idea for features for Earl's show. 
[00:23:30]  All right.  His Black Rock show.  Yeah, Black Rock.  Uh, the features would have to be, uh, large lips, big nostrils, and kinky hair.  What?  No, not features like that, you nut.  Oh, I'm confused, then.  Yeah, we're not, get out of here, Bill.  Jesus Christ.  Features.  Earl, I apologize for that one, too.  Uh, Craig, what's up?  Hey, I got a game for Earl's show.  All right.  Who's my real father?  You know, why can't he bring up a suggestion for a show and not have to be subject to all 
[00:24:00]  these stereotypes?  Bad old gig.  God.  Shut up, Earl.  Oh, I'm trying to do this.  Features, features for Earl's, uh, show.  Lieutenant Boogaloo from Jersey.  The, the in-jail hour.  Spotlight one hour of artists in prison.  Drive-by rocking.  Spotlight artists killed in gunfights.  That could be a good one, though.  Uh, ghetto talk.  Like coffee talk, but with brothers. 
[00:24:30]  These people are so friggin' bad, man.  Yeah, Earl, I, I'm read, I, I'm reading through these instant feedbacks, and I'm horrified.  Unbelievable.  Can't read that one.  All the, uh, someone suggesting that all the live reads would have to be done at the  first of the month when everyone has their chance.  Okay.  I hope he's almost spit his coffee out.  It's just so bad. 
[00:25:00]  It's alive and well in America.  Earl comes to us with this great idea for a show, and look what happens.  Uh, the slogan for the show, you give us 22 minutes, we'll rob your house.  Sort of a take off on the winds, uh, thing.  Jim, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  No more American Top 40.  Now you got the African American Top 4-0.  There you go.  The Top 4-0.  With Kasi Kassim.  Yeah, some of these people are really, really bad. 
[00:25:30]  Let's go to, uh, Dave.  I got a good idea for Earl's show.  Yeah, he needs some features, so help us out here.  You can do, uh, the finger-licking good song of the day.  Oh, my God.  Bring the bell.  Trying to get somebody on the phone.  They have their first request.  All right.  For Earl's, uh, Black Rock show.  Earl, why don't you make believe you're on the air and you're talking to a listener?  See, that's just, I...  You're taking a...  Just go, yeah, yeah, take the first caller.  Here's, uh, here's, uh, you know, you're on the air. 
[00:26:00]  No, no, he's got to do the whole, you know, make believe you're coming out of a jam.  And then go to the phones.  And go to the phones.  For a request.  And go, hey, what do you want to hear?  Okay?  We just want to hear how this Black Rock, uh, show.  Go ahead.  See, I wouldn't, I wouldn't be hosting it.  Well, just, go ahead.  Earl, the bosses are listening.  Now you're putting me on the spot.  And then go to the phones to take a request.  Give him a song that's fading out, Ant.  Oh, why, why?  Say, uh, say, uh, Sly and the Family Stone.  Right.  Fading out.  Here you go. 
[00:26:30]  The mic is on.  It's the Black Rock show with Earl.  Go ahead.  Let it rip.  This is the Black Rock Coalition radio show.  You just heard some Sly and the Family Stone.  And let's go to the phones right now.  So, ask them what they want to hear.  Uh, what would you like to hear?  Come on.  How about a good old work song?  I knew I was getting set up.  Oh, no.  How did that guy from Blazing Saddles call in?  That's a long.  That's horrible.  That's a long way for a joke.  Oh, my God.  The Overland route. 
[00:27:00]  Ring it again.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  This is horrible.  You're horrible.  Don in East Meadow, you go to church.  Oh, my God.  Oh, a lot of cooking show suggestions.  No, no, you can't say that.  Dennis, they could play What's in My Big Baggy Pants.  Gun, knife, or razor blade.  Oh, my God.  Ring the bell. 
[00:27:30]  Yes.  Oh, of course.  And Dean from Wayne wants to know, don't you have to know how to read to do live reads?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, Earl.  This Black Rock show sounds like it has some possibilities.  Yeah, I'm pretty confident about it.  Yeah.  I would listen.  Would you ever consider O.J. as a special guest DJ for a day?  Are you kidding me?  Everybody would be listening if we had O.J.  Wouldn't that be great?  Yeah.  We wouldn't leave the show alive. 
[00:28:00]  I'm going to be playing some killer music.  Oh, no, no, no.  I didn't mean it like that.  Will Greaseman be your sidekick, right?  No.  That would be good.  Yadda doodle.  Yeah, the Black Rock Coalition show.  Bone dry.  I'm here with the black girl.  I'm going to be playing all the songs from black artists.  Don't punch me.  Apologize.  Apologize.  Earl, I think it's a great idea.  All right, we'll take a break, Anthony. 
[00:28:30]  What, what, what, what?  Earl's first joke on the show.  Will you be doing any little jokes and comedy between the other things?  Absolutely not.  Little talks?  This guy Greg from Newark suggests a joke.  What is long and hard on a black man?  The second grade.  Well, that's Greg from Newark.  What do I know?  So there it is.  All right, Earl.  Well, we'll be looking forward to it.  I hope the boss is considerate and taken on.  It's the O.B. and Anthony.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[00:29:00]  92.3 K-Rock.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal.  You are listening to the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  I guess which is their best, really.  You know, when you think about it.  Just open your eyes.  Just open your eyes.  See that life is beautiful. 
[00:29:30]  There you go, Nicky Six.  Life is beautiful.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  And, of course, we've got Nicky Six in studio.  Good morning, guys.  How are you, sir?  I'm doing good.  A little early for you, you were saying?  You need your coffee?  Yeah, I just need a coffee.  You know, it's not necessarily early.  I'm up with my kids really early.  But we've been out on this book signing tour. 
[00:30:00]  And it goes from this hour till, you know, midnight every night.  Wow.  Oof.  But it's good.  Yeah, today I'll be in three cities.  Well, yeah.  A thousand people last night at the Virgin Megastore for the book signing.  Wow, nice.  That's amazing.  You did one in New York already?  Yeah, yeah.  And you're doing other ones in New York?  No, that's it.  I think it's Philly tonight, right?  Yeah, Philly.  And then I leave for Boston right after that.  Philly tonight, Boston tomorrow, I believe, if I got it right.  Yeah, and then Toronto, and then we'll be done on this little run. 
[00:30:30]  Right.  And, of course, you're talking about the book, The Heroin Diaries.  Yes.  A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rockstar.  I've got to start by saying The Dirt.  Yeah.  The book you guys wrote together, Motley Crue, all the behind-the-scenes stories.  One of my favorite rock books of all time.  It really turned out great.  So I can't wait to read The Heroin Diaries because I've got to assume it's going to be just as good, if not better.  I think you're going to really be into it.  There's a different perspective.  It's like a fly-on-the-wall perspective for one person that's going through an addiction. 
[00:31:00]  And then also what was interesting is me reading my own diaries and seeing my own questions inside the diaries, what I was going through, what I was asking.  Right.  And then later, when I got away from all the drugs and alcohol, that I actually figured that out.  But I was asking in the midst of this chaotic time.  Well, what's amazing, he's got this big heroin addiction and you're still writing in a diary.  Yeah.  That's what I find amazing.  You know, a lot of people do.  And actually, if you knew me and saw me daily, at any time in my life, you'd get it. 
[00:31:30]  I always usually have a binder with me.  I'm always writing in it.  You know, I'll go out and I'll be sitting out somewhere and I'm just writing.  People are like, what are you doing?  I go, I'm writing a song.  Or I'm writing because I'm a writer.  It's like I want to take it all in and put it down.  Did you read some of this stuff and go, what?  What is this?  Yeah.  What was that guy thinking?  Or what was happening around me.  All right.  How were you, like, functional at that level of drug use? 
[00:32:00]  Like, how did you go out and play and just perform?  Well, when you read the book, you're going to see that, you know, I had to get off of the heroin to get on tour.  Mm-hmm.  You know, but then other things come in.  So there's the debauchery and there's, you know, you're going to really dig it.  Because everybody in the band gets to talk about it and ex-girlfriends and ex-managers and ex-record company people, other musicians.  They finally say what they want to say years ago when you were going through that, probably.  You know, exactly.  Because they probably didn't have the balls back in the day to go, hey, dude, you're ruining everything. 
[00:32:30]  They just let you do your thing, probably.  And it was hard to get people to be honest because they don't want to hurt your feelings.  Right.  So now, you know, it's like a guy's going to go, yeah, dude, you're a jackass back then.  And they're mostly going to say, no, man, you know, you were a little bit of a pain in the ass, but, you know, you're great now.  And I'm like, that's not going to help the book.  That's not going to help people that have addiction problems if we're going to just fluff around this thing.  Yeah, tell me what I was doing and how you felt about it.  Exactly.  And that way other people can relate to that. 
[00:33:00]  I've read so much great stuff.  It's like, Nikki, like, you lived like a rock star.  I mean, like, when I think of a rock star, I think of a guy who did nothing but drugs and bang chicks.  And it's like, that's what he did all over the world.  It's like, there's just such a.  Well, you can't just do it in L.A.  I mean, you've got to take it everywhere.  Yeah, that's true.  If you're not going to abuse them in Japan.  Otherwise, you're a local band.  One of my favorite stories from Dirt, I think it was you, they thought you were dead in Japan or something.  They threw you in a dumpster.  That would be London.  London?  Get our geographics right. 
[00:33:30]  That's when I was like, wow, I can't put this book down.  They thought he was dead.  Who thought you were dead?  The people you were partying with?  Dealers, yeah.  Dealers and stuff.  So they're like, oh, man.  And they just threw him in a dumpster in London and left him there.  I think it's pretty funny.  No one wants a dead rock star.  I don't think anybody wants a live rock star, to be honest.  Yeah.  It's bad enough.  You don't want to have to deal with that.  Just put him in the dumpster.  Just be done with him.  And what happened?  I don't want to find him.  You just woke up in the dumpster?  No, no.  I'm going to go get coffee and a bagel or something?  Yeah, that sounds good, actually.  I'm talking a bagel right now. 
[00:34:00]  I mean, you know, you read about it.  You get it.  You know, you overdose.  You know, they don't think you're going to come back.  They need to get rid of you.  You know, it was cool because in the book, you know, I get to talk about that stuff,  but also what it's like now.  You know, what it's like now being a single father, raising these kids, doing for my kids  what my dad never did for me.  And, you know, I'll never say, first, I'll never apologize for any of the craziness that  Motley Crue did back in the day.  And still, you know, I'm just not going to apologize because that's who we are. 
[00:34:30]  But how do your kids listen to you?  When you try to tell them to do something, you're like, ah, dad.  No, no.  And then they show you like page 78 and third.  You know, stop.  I can't listen.  No, seriously.  How does that work?  I mean, we have a really open, you know, relationship.  And we talk about everything.  And for my kids, the same thing as I tell kids, like last night at the book signing,  they come up and they want to know how to get off drugs or they're saying they just got  out of treatment or their brother or their father died from heroin use or coke use. 
[00:35:00]  And, you know, for me, I don't want to be a preacher.  I don't want to stand up and be some, like, goody two-shoes guy.  I just want to say this is what's behind door number one.  This is what's behind door number two.  You can pick it.  Do you still get the urge?  No, absolutely not.  Really?  No.  You offer everything now?  Like drugs, alcohol, everything?  Yeah, everything.  But, I mean, I work it pretty hard, you know.  It's just like part for me of this book, you know, I give proceeds of this book to Covenant  House, which there's one right here in New York City. 
[00:35:30]  And they do amazing stuff for these kids that are on the street.  And it resonates for me because I ran away as a teenager myself.  So how do you replace that urge?  I'm an extremely creative person.  I mean, I do photography.  I have a clothing line called Royal Underground.  You know, I have a new band, 6 a.m.  And then the soundtrack to the book, I'm writing a novel, I'm, you know, writing and producing.  So you're just trying to keep busy.  Not so much.  Jesus.  Wow.  Well, I just mean, well, because. 
[00:36:00]  He's keeping busy.  Well, Jimmy, Jimmy got sobered 17?  18.  18.  Yeah.  18, he knew that this was not for him.  Yeah.  So I replaced it with prostitutes.  Did that work out for you?  Not well, no.  But it's that same mania you put into the one.  Yeah.  So if you're putting that into creativity, it's like you're going to get a lot of stuff done.  Well, that prostitutes, that'd be kind of like gambling.  Yeah, in a way.  Who needs condoms?  Come on.  Snake eyes.  Oh, damn crap.  I had a few of those under address. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  We got now.  We're interviewing you now.  Oh, we have for many years.  I didn't mean to downplay it, but it seems like it would be maybe easier if you're just  keeping yourself busy being a creative person.  Well, it's not keeping myself busy so much.  I don't understand is what I'm getting at.  Yeah, I mean, I understand what you're saying.  You know, one thing about the word recovery and people think, oh, someone's in recovery.  Okay, they lost their balls.  And to me, what I recovered through recovery was actually everything that I'm doing now.  You know, you get like messed up. 
[00:37:00]  You get sidetracked, you know.  And I just want to be the best artist I can be and do the best stuff.  And I still want to go around the world and blow stuff up.  And I'm single.  So that means that, you know, the world's my playground right now.  Did you ever see like back maybe during a moment of clarity back then yourself as you  are right now?  Or did you think like that was just an impossibility that you would be clean and just...  Yeah, exactly.  I was just on Capitol Hill talking to Washington, D.C. 
[00:37:30]  Most surreal thing ever.  I was thinking to myself, what the hell?  Yeah, right?  How did I end up here?  I'm standing there.  I'm sitting next to Congressman Patrick Kennedy.  I'm with NADAC and SAMHSA.  I'm with Dr. Wesley Clark.  We're doing satellite tours.  They're using me as a reliable source to what goes on in the street and the getting out of it.  And I'm using them and working with them on all their statistics and all their ability 
[00:38:00]  to reach mass media and kids.  I'm sitting up there in a tie.  It had skulls on it, but it was still a tie.  It's a tie.  And, you know, I'm thinking that actually I was nervous.  Yeah.  Like I don't get nervous, go on stage or anything.  But I was like, this is really important, you know, moment, right?  I can actually do something different where you can say you can still kick ass, you can 
[00:38:30]  still rock, and you don't have to be the clown.  Right.  You know, you can do both.  You can still have a great time.  You can still do all the chicks.  You can still, you know, drive the coolest cars.  You can do it all.  You can be rock and roll 200% and not do that stuff.  So if you do that stuff, if you drink, you do drugs, and it works for you, man, hats off.  I think it's just great.  Me, I can't do it.  But I'm just definitely the guy you don't want to be doing that.  It's interesting because the crew is just, it was the, like, definitive rock band of 
[00:39:00]  the 80s.  I mean, you guys were it after you guys, like everybody, wanted to look and sound like that.  Yeah.  We apologize for that.  Yeah, there are a couple that are like, wow.  Yeah.  Dude, you missed the whole idea there.  Not every rock star could pull off the mascara and stuff, man.  That's what he's getting at.  You look back on that and then see where you are now and the rest of the guys, because we've 
[00:39:30]  spoken with the rest of the guys in the band and stuff.  There are, it's such different personalities.  I think everybody just puts you, because you mentioned clown.  Everyone kind of puts Motley Crue in this category and assumes everybody is the same in the band.  You're all just, you know, chugging down the Jack Daniels man and, you know, snorting coke  off hookers' backs and everything like that.  And then you talk to you guys individually and you're such different people.  Yeah.  That's what makes the band, actually, is that we are all so different. 
[00:40:00]  We listen to different music.  We're different personalities.  We actually should never have got together as a band because it makes no sense.  Yeah.  But I think some of the greatest bands are like that.  Yeah.  You look at the who.  You look at those four guys and you go, those guys should never even talk to each other.  Much less being a band, but it makes one of the greatest bands in the world.  It was a great moment with you and I think Mick Morris was when you were on Ozzy's Don't Blame Me  and you guys were talking about the old tour that you did with him where he came out on a dress 
[00:40:30]  and just like the back and forth debauchery between Motley Crue and Ozzy.  And like, I think it was 84, you guys toured him on Shout at the Devil.  Yeah, Shout at the Devil and he had Bark at the Moon.  It was insane.  Yeah, that's two bands that should have never talked to each other.  Yeah, 83, 84.  Yeah, Sharon actually, you know, she basically banned us from our own dressing room.  Anywhere we went, there was like watchful eyes of Sharon Osbourne.  I remember at one point I said, Sharon, I go, you know, I got to get laid. 
[00:41:00]  And she goes, you know, why are you talking to me?  I go, you won't let anybody backstage.  And I kind of, you know, pulled the poor baby band puppy dog eyes on her.  And so she goes, one time and one time only.  And she like grabbed my hand.  I got to walk her up to, you know, the front row and I go, I'll take that one.  And so I got one and the rest of the guys in the band are like, how'd you do that?  I go, man, I've been working on it for weeks.  I'd be like, hi, Sharon.  She was that strict where you couldn't get anybody backstage. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, listen, man.  Yeah, you just went shopping.  I like that.  I want that one.  Ozzy's got to get permission to ****.  I mean, she is the boss.  Yeah.  The boss.  But she's great, though.  She's wonderful.  So is Ozzy.  She's a tyrant in a way and very sweet in a way, but she managed that maniac for all  these years.  She took Ozzy from like, you know, and he's laying in a hotel with a pizza box on his chest  and he's stalled out of his head.  Oh, listen, how she did it, I don't know.  I remember one time we were on tour and Mick Mars decided to hit on Sharon. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, no.  Right?  And so a few years ago, I had lunch with Sharon.  I said, hey, remember the time Mick Mars kind of hit on you?  And she goes, yeah.  She goes, yeah.  She goes, I don't even sleep with my husband.  Why would I sleep with Mick Mars?  She has a sexy vibe, though.  I met her like twice.  And there's a sexy vibe coming off her where you could kind of misinterpret like, wow,  she kind of digs me.  But that's just, they like, oh, yeah, now I see why Ozzy.  They just moved into my neighborhood.  So to the left, Ozzy and Sharon live.  I live in the middle. 
[00:42:30]  And on the right lives Alex Van Halen.  And so I think what me and Alex are going to do is we're going to TP their house.  And the rest of the neighborhood, Stepford Wives.  Yeah.  It's really scary in there.  Beverly Hills?  No, it's out, way out in the middle of nowhere.  When they told me Ozzy moved in there, I go, he's going to lose his mind.  Because it's like paint drying out here.  Really?  Yeah.  When you bring up the whole, you know, you just point and go, I want that one thing.  Yeah.  With the chicks and stuff back in those days and everything. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, yeah.  All the time as radio DJs, we just do that.  We say, I want that one, but it ends there.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just one of those.  We have our choice of fatties.  It's awesome.  We love the piglets.  You know the ones you spit on?  Those are the ones I'm like, come on, just let me give you the first three digits of the number.  I'll figure it out.  I'll figure it out.  You guys, that was, you must have just sat back and thought to yourselves in the dressing room or just hanging out writing and stuff.  Did you just look at each other and go, wow, how the hell did this happen? 
[00:43:30]  And did you ever expect to be that huge?  Because you guys were just the hugest rock band, man.  It was the videos all over MTV.  Yeah.  Live Wire, one of the first ones banned from MTV when you guys did Live Wire.  That was a band video, I think.  I don't think it was that was banned yet.  Oh, coffee.  I remember they had to change the rules to like one of their countdown shows because Home Sweet Home every goddamn week.  It was just Home Sweet Home.  What's interesting is, you know, rock and roll, all music, to be honest with you, jazz, funk, you know, everything goes goes up and down in popularity. 
[00:44:00]  And rock had, you know, peaked at a certain point and then gone down and reinvented itself.  So we went to go back out to do the last tour, the Carnival of Sins and the Red, White and Crew Tour.  All the promoters, they're like, this is never going to work.  So we rented all the buildings ourselves, promoted it ourselves and sold the whole thing out in five minutes. 
[00:44:30]  It was it was unbelievable.  So, I mean, you know what, the 20, you know, five years later, we're still selling out arenas.  It's it's it's a pretty cool thing to be able to do a new band and a book.  Well, let's go to Sue in Connecticut.  Huge fan.  Right.  So we got Nikki Sixx in studio, the Heroin Diaries.  All right.  What do you got, Sue?  Nikki, I have been a fan of yours since I was 15 years old.  I've been following your career for as long as I could remember.  You are awesome.  I just finished a book at three o'clock this morning and it was amazing.  I learned a lot more than I did before I knew you. 
[00:45:00]  I will continue to support you.  Your career is you've come a long way.  I just wanted to let you know that.  She had a snore Coke to stay up till three to read it.  I love your wine.  It's amazing.  The CD 6 a.m. is also amazing.  I can't wait to see you guys on tour.  Is this your sister or something?  I saw you on the Red, White & Crew and I had a huge banner in the second row and it was  just amazing.  And I just need to tell you that you have a fan for life.  Thank you.  Yeah, but did you ever go backstage?  I never had the chance to meet them.  I would love to meet them.  That's good for you.  I don't know what that means. 
[00:45:30]  Yes, your memory wouldn't be as fond.  They've got me through a lot of hard times in high school.  My classmates nicknamed me Motley Sue and to this day it's still in my yearbook, 1988.  Were you at the book signing last night?  I couldn't make the book signing because I called Virgin Records and they told me I had  to buy the book from them and I already had the book.  So buy it again and meet Nikki Sixx.  What's the matter with you?  Well, let me tell you.  Obviously not that big of a fan.  Nah, that's cool.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I am a huge fan.  Well, you got a question though?  Something?  You like the book? 
[00:46:00]  Like what did you like about the book?  I loved everything about the book.  I sympathize with you, everything that you've gone through.  I didn't realize that you have a third, second sister.  I'm sorry, Lisa.  And that really touched my heart.  I'm just so happy that it didn't take you over.  The drug didn't take you over.  I'm glad that you survived.  I come from an alcoholic family and I can sympathize.  Yeah, so you get it when you read the book.  You understand that part of it.  Well, thank you very much.  And those are kind words.  Yeah.  And basically, Nikki's saying, stop stalking them. 
[00:46:30]  Buy the book, you shizler.  How do you listen to a new shizler?  I was going to come see you, Nikki, but the parkway toll is 35 cents.  Just buy another copy.  Water.  Yeah, you could have met him.  Nikki needs water.  What is with our staff?  I will try to meet him on the next tour.  I'm going to have a huge banner.  I'm going to get front row.  I've got a picture of a pin that a friend drew for me who's an artist that I wanted to give to him yesterday.  But I just, you know, I'm a single mother.  I couldn't be down there with another 40 bucks. 
[00:47:00]  You know, I'm sorry.  Aw, single mom.  Hey, thank you.  All right.  Listen, we've got to take a quick break.  More with Nikki Six after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is Joe Perry.  This is John C.  This is Brian Regan.  This is Charlie Murphy.  This is Lois Griffin.  This is Ozzy Osbourne.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This is Larry the Cable Guy.  You're listening to the worst.  The worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:47:30]  It's the worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's good.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  Nikki Six in studio today.  Hey, hey.  The book, The Heroin Diaries, A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star.  Getting rave reviews.  People are picking it up.  If you liked The Dirt, the book Nikki Six did with his band.  Yeah.  Motley Crue, of course.  You're going to love this one as well.  And there's great commentary.  Like, every page you open, there's something really cool like Doc McGee. 
[00:48:00]  There's a great line here about when you were with Vanity.  He said, Nikki was into Vanity because she just kind of the whole Prince thing.  Rock stars are star effers.  Nikki might just as easily have grabbed Granny from the Beverly Hills.  You know what's great is sitting down with all these people before they did their commentary  and saying, be as brutal and honest as you can.  Because it's part, there's a lot of humor in it.  Yeah.  You know, there's a lot of, you know, there's good stuff and bad stuff. 
[00:48:30]  I mean, it's...  Anyone you want to punch in the face?  Go, oh, man, dude.  The only people I was...  You're killing me.  I was like, I almost took a couple people out of the book because they were being too nice.  Oh.  I was like, come on, dude.  Get real.  Get real.  Yeah.  Tell the truth.  And a lot of people, to be honest with you, which, you know, I can't even believe it,  would return my calls, certain artists, and would say, yeah, man, I want to be involved.  The, you know, proceeds are going to a charity.  That's really cool, Nikki. 
[00:49:00]  You know, you're doing this thing for the kids on the street and it's going to help people.  And then they would go AWOL because then I'd get a phone call from a manager.  Well, you know, they did the same stuff as you, but they don't want anybody to know.  Yeah.  And I'd go, that's why you're in the wimp section, you know, when the music starts.  So, you're just like, come on, man.  Hey, we went to get the wiffle ball back.  Yeah.  As soon as we went to break, we're like, Nikki, your game is one of the greatest bits ever.  Yep.  Motley Crue came in.  And it went on to become legendary.  Legendary.  Yeah.  We finally had to retire the wiffle ball back. 
[00:49:30]  We're showing you some of the pictures in the background.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Basically, it's a takeoff on one of the things you guys used to do backstage with, what was it?  Well, I can't say what it was.  It was just this thing.  It was a marital aid.  Yeah.  They call them marital aids.  Is that what they call them?  Yeah.  But it looked like two of them glued together, let's say.  And they kind of did a tug of war type of thing.  Yeah.  It's like a Siamese twin kind of.  There you go.  Siamese twin.  Oh, look at it.  It's being presented like it's Babe Ruth's bat. 
[00:50:00]  It was a tug of war thing.  I just want to set it up.  And the girl that got to the middle first in this tug of war competition won some kind of favor from Motley Crue.  I hope that thing.  Is that sealed under there?  No, it just slides right off.  It slides right off.  Don't touch it.  Yeah.  Don't touch it.  Don't even look at it.  It's in glass, though.  That's been retired.  That bat hasn't been used in probably two years now.  Two and a half years.  I think that needs more of like a trophy case.  Yeah.  Yep. 
[00:50:30]  Absolutely.  You guys aren't doing that justice.  You have to.  Look, he's scared.  Don't worry.  You won't catch anything.  Oh, I don't believe it.  It's kind of under glass.  There's like seepage out the sides.  Yeah, out the sides.  You've pointed at them.  So, you guys called it the Motley Crue Challenge and we called it the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Yeah, I think you guys took it one step higher and took it all around the country.  So, you guys are kind of like rock stars.  And just like you, we kind of grew up and realized, you know what, we've got to stop this or we're not going to be able to do a radio show anymore.  That's right. 
[00:51:00]  We finally realized that it wasn't a good thing.  And then Ann and I talk and we're like, we can't believe we used to do this on regular radio.  Yeah.  Amazed.  I mean, look at the pictures.  How do you even describe that on regular radio?  Things have changed, haven't they?  They have.  But you guys, you know, you have a forum for your insanity somewhere out there that we know about.  A lot of people are requesting that.  I was just going to talk about the girls on the road and stuff.  Obviously, you guys, legendary.  Do you even have an idea of a roundabout figure as far as numbers go? 
[00:51:30]  Or was it just a blur?  I'm a bass player.  I can't count past four.  Right.  Let's take a call.  You see how I dodged that?  You really did dodge it.  I'm good, right?  That just means so many.  All right, then let's play this for Nicky.  A lot of people are requesting this today.  It's one of our favorite clips.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they come at the Palladium in Los Angeles.  They're back together.  Their first live get-together in five years. 
[00:52:00]  The Motley Crue.  That was one of the greatest intros ever, man.  We had to have played that 20 times.  Larry's great.  Their get-together, like it's four old ladies on a coffee club.  The Motley Crue.  I love that part.  I love that.  I wanted to change the name of the band after that.  To The Motley Crue.  To The Motley Crue.  Oh, God.  He's classic, you know.  Oh, yeah.  He actually knows a lot of the songs, believe it or not. 
[00:52:30]  Did he really?  Yeah, we were talking about it.  Because when we saw it, we were watching the interview and everything.  It was a big thing.  Yeah.  So we're watching it and just going, oh, my God.  Larry is hysterical.  He's just The Motley Crue.  He's great.  That's one of my, you know, I've got a few things that I've always had on a list that  I've wanted to do.  One was to play with the Rolling Stones we did.  One was to play bass in Aerosmith.  And I got to, on my birthday, I got to play on this last tour with Motley Crue and Aerosmith.  Got to play bass on stage with them.  And then another one is to, you know, as an artist, you know, alone, not as a band member, 
[00:53:00]  to go on Larry King's show.  So, you know, that's, when I hear that, it's just like, The Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue, yeah.  Let's go to Chicago.  Steve has something for Nikki Sixx.  Steve, what's up?  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I was just calling.  I was, I've been a heroin addict for a book.  Whoa, hey, hey.  Oh, I can't say this.  Well, we just want everyone to be able to hear you.  So Steve's calling from Chicago.  You've been on heroin for a long time? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, actually, I've been in a methadone clinic for about a year and a half now.  That's hard to get off.  Actually, that's what I was calling for, man.  I was wanting to know how you actually, like, started living your life after you quit.  You know what I'm saying?  And were you still in the band at the time?  Yeah, I was.  Have you been in treatment?  Actually, I haven't really been to, like, a therapist or anything,  but I have a counselor at the methadone clinic who was an addict for 30-some years or something like that.  Do you have insurance?  No.  So you can't get treatment? 
[00:54:00]  No.  So you have to do outpatient.  What the?  So you have to do outpatient stuff like methadone?  Yeah, that's where I'm at right now.  I've been there for a year and a half, though, and it doesn't seem like it's going anywhere.  There's supposedly, and I can't speak really knowing,  but I've been talking to some people when I was in Washington, D.C.,  and there's some opiate blockers that are available now.  But you can take them, and that'll help you wean off of the methadone.  That's the hardest thing to get off of, even more than the heroin.  Yes.  Because it's synthetic, and it gets into your bones, as you know. 
[00:54:30]  It's ridiculous.  You know, I go there.  I wake up at 6 in the morning.  I can't even sleep in.  Sure.  You know what I'm saying?  It wakes me up almost, you know.  Yeah.  So it's just ridiculous.  I was just seeing what somebody in your position, you know what I'm saying?  And everybody's looking up to you to be on your game or whatever.  This is what I would suggest.  This is what I'd suggest, just from my experience,  is find a way to block the opiates somehow so that you can get some clarity,  whatever you have to do,  and then get yourself into some kind of a therapy program  so you can figure out what it is that's driven you there in the first place. 
[00:55:00]  Because you take the drugs away, bro, you're just going to feel bad.  You've got to figure out what's making you feel bad so you can get on with your life.  You're exactly right.  You know, because I've been sitting there, it's so damn hard to say you're going to quit forever, too.  That's the main thing I'm having a problem with.  You know what I'm saying?  Get that out of your head.  That's just being stupid.  It is.  It's just being stupid.  I've had relapse because of that exact thought.  I remember going, well, when I'm 70, I'll be sitting on the beach with a margarita,  and I'm going, okay, I'm 30, and I'm sick, so I've got 40 years until I can drink again, 
[00:55:30]  and then I'm just pissed.  So, you know, what you should do today is just,  you've already been to the methadone clinic today,  is just you need to do anything and everything in your power to get something to block that  or wean off of that, and then get off and change all your friends and change where you live  and get into therapy, bro, and you can do it.  Man, I appreciate it.  Hey, you coming to Chicago anytime, too, with that book?  I was just through there.  Chicago? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah.  Oops.  Of course you were.  You missed it.  Yeah, you missed it.  Hey, good luck, bro.  Good luck.  Hey, thank you guys, man.  I appreciate having me on, man.  All right.  Hey, man, can I just, before we go there,  because I say there's a lot of entries about the Park and Meridian Hotel,  which is right across the street from where we are.  You haven't been there in a long time.  It's from 87, and it's like you're just talking here about the vanity showing up.  Like, I know she's going to say something to embarrass me,  and I'm like, even when you're a rock star,  you've got to worry about the broad running her mouth and embarrassing you.  Yeah, but you know what?  If she wrote the book, she'd say,  Nicky's going to show up. 
[00:56:30]  I hope he doesn't say anything to embarrass me.  This is great, though.  This is really honest, man.  This is really, really interesting.  Did you find out what got you on heroin?  Like, you gave that guy advice and said, you know, you need to do that.  Was it your childhood or something?  You know what?  It sounds new age and sounds, you know, kind of goofy,  especially sitting here being a bunch of guys.  But what it was for me was, you know, I call it peel and the onion.  You get back all the way to the core.  My dad left when I was three, never knew the guy, 
[00:57:00]  only ever heard he was a jackass.  That's all I ever heard about the guy.  So I'm growing up going, yeah, my dad's a jerk.  And then my mom, she basically was wild,  and I ended up, she left about when I was six.  Wow.  So then I'm with my grandparents, so I'm going, okay,  so dad's a jackass, mom don't care.  And then as my grandparents were moving around, moving around,  and I didn't even know what that did to me.  Yeah, I was going to ask you,  did you have any clue that that was screwing you up in any way, shape, or form? 
[00:57:30]  You just thought, eh.  No, and then, like, later you start, you know, going like, you know,  that girl will fulfill that feeling.  That drug will fulfill that feeling.  That amount of success will make me feel like I didn't have those feelings.  And, you know, then all of a sudden everything blows up,  and we're like, you know, the wiffle bat kings of the world.  And all of a sudden one day I'm sitting there,  and I start, the bottom starts to fall out.  And I don't know what it is.  And then, you know, you get through it, and you go, 
[00:58:00]  okay, let's go all the way back.  Like I told the guy, get off the drugs,  get to the core,  and then live your life.  It's not so hard.  It's hard, but it's not so hard.  You know what I found out?  I talk to these kids,  and I work with the kids at Covenant House,  and these kids have it hard.  The guy we just talked to, he has it hard.  He's been on methadone for years.  Living in the street, that's really hard.  You know, I'm very fortunate.  When I peel the onion back, I go, okay, I got some issues.  Yeah, I was a runaway.  Yeah, I had to sleep on people's couches. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, I had to sleep in some pretty weird places.  Yeah, I had some mixed up feelings and hormones and teenage angst.  But in the end, I got to get to the core of it.  And it wasn't so bad that it was worth to kill myself over.  And that's what kids find out.  I'll tell you what.  If you wait until you're 30, you've got 30 years of onion to peel.  And if you wait until you're 40, you've got more.  And if you do it when you're a teenager, it's a lot easier  than waiting until you're like the guy we just talked to,  who's like, man, if I would have cut this off 
[00:59:00]  when I was 11, 12, 13 years old,  I wouldn't be having to call in and say what I'm saying.  He would have been able to deal with it then and get on with it.  Have you ever met your dad?  Never met him.  Do you know where he is?  In a grave.  Oh, okay.  I found his grave.  And I just looked down and I said, you know what?  I forgive you.  Actually, you blew it.  Because I'm a pretty good son.  And I walked away and I let go of it.  You know, I've forgiven my mom.  You know, we've made amends. 
[00:59:30]  Life's good.  But I've got kids of my own.  I don't have time to be, you know,  mucking around in the past anymore.  I've got to stay in the present.  Yeah, this is a little strange because we've got Howie.  Howie.  Hey, how you doing?  We're Howie Mandel from Deal and Ho Deal.  We've got Nikki Sixx from The Motley Crew in studio.  We're talking about addiction.  Hi, Nikki.  How you doing?  How's Hidden Hills?  Too bad.  Congratulations on the book, man.  I've been listening to your tour.  I'm going out to buy the book today.  And congratulations on your life and turning that around. 
[01:00:00]  Thank you.  Do you guys know each other?  Well, we live in the same neighborhood.  Wow.  You guys.  I've been being nice, you know, because Ozzy moved in there, right?  Yes, he did.  Yeah.  Ozzy's in my backyard.  Oh, dude.  I'm so sorry.  He's literally in his backyard.  He can't get him out.  You know, I've been being respectful and haven't been telling everybody you live there now,  but we're TPing you now.  Yeah.  You'll know who it is now.  This is a wild neighborhood.  Really?  You've got Nikki Sixx.  You've got Ozzy. 
[01:00:30]  You've got Howie Mandel.  Who was the other person?  Oh, and Alex Van Halen.  Who else lives in there, Howie?  Melissa Etheridge is here.  Oh, she does.  I'm the only one that can't play a lick of music.  It's a bunch of musicians and Howie.  No, that's actually not true.  That'd be two of us.  Damn, Howie.  Howie, you ever do heroin with Nikki Sixx?  No.  No.  No.  But we've got, you know, that recovery thing in common. 
[01:01:00]  Yes.  Well, I don't know.  From OCD, I don't know if that's the thing.  I have OCD.  I'm not recovering.  I just can't get over it.  But I, why, why, why, Nikki?  I was kidding.  You know what?  You know what's the worst thing is?  When a bass player tries to be funny with a comedian.  That's just like, and then he gets all serious and he's like.  Well, because Howie's like, what does he know?  What does he know?  Yeah, actually, he got nervous.  He got nervous.  And listening to you, so you've been on that coast for a couple days. 
[01:01:30]  You've acclimated to that time.  For me, it's like 5.45 in the morning.  I don't even know what I'm saying.  I know exactly.  Howie, with your OCD issues, have you ever even, like, just shared a joint with someone?  Or would that be just insane?  No, I've never actually shared.  And in my younger years, I've never, I never.  That's what I mean, in your younger years, of course.  Yes, I never shared.  I wouldn't share anything.  I didn't.  It was all me.  Me, me, me, me, me, me.  It was all me.  I'm actually, it's early in the morning here and I'm locked in. 
[01:02:00]  And my wife just bought me this coolest thing.  I got this Brill toilet thing.  I got a new thing where you wave your hand over it and the plastic goes around the seat automatically.  That's a new thing that went on your new cool toilet.  I got to explain to Nicky.  We had Howie on, I guess, last week and we were obsessed with this toilet thing.  He's got the coolest toilet.  He's got the coolest toilet.  He stayed in the presidential suite of one of these hotels in New York and it was this toilet where the lid goes up automatically. 
[01:02:30]  You don't do nothing but just sit there.  But is it as cool as the ones in Japan?  That's exactly the one it is.  Oh, I hate you.  I wanted that.  The Toto?  You live right near and just go over and take a dump.  Oh, yeah, right.  Can I come over?  You come over and look at it.  Look at it.  The thing is that my wife said I was going to put one, I was going to buy a bunch of them.  And I said I want to put one in the guest, like we have the guest bathroom downstairs. 
[01:03:00]  And she said she doesn't want people lingering.  Like people are going to come over to our house just to crap.  Well, I mean, if Ozzy hears this, he's coming over.  Yeah, you've got to watch that too.  I bet that's not.  Yes.  I bet that's a mess.  Did the people from Nelrest or Toto call you from last week?  Because you guys deserve three toilets.  I think they should be shipping some toilets to us.  You know, you've got to put me on that list because every time I go to Japan, as soon as I get into the hotel, I just go sit down on that toilet.  I'm like, this is, I made it. 
[01:03:30]  I don't care about the garden.  I don't care about the Staples Center.  It's the toilet.  The toilet is where it's at.  You don't press the front wash.  That's the big problem.  I accidentally pressed front wash.  It works like a speed bag.  That's got to hurt a little bit.  It did.  And I didn't want to get up because I didn't want to soak the room.  He loves his toilet, but it sounds great.  All right.  We're running out of time on this part of the show there. 
[01:04:00]  Howie, the big headline, Deal or No Deal is live tonight, and you're going to be giving away that million dollars sooner than later, right?  And if the million dollar mission starts tonight, we'll keep adding.  So keep watching.  Nicky, congratulations on the book.  I'll see you back in the hood.  Yes, sir.  Thanks, bud, for calling.  Good luck on that tonight.  Good luck.  Bye-bye.  See you, man.  Howie Mandel.  He's a great guy.  He's becoming a regular on the show.  He's a great guy.  He's so funny, man.  He's nuts, and we love that about him.  Yeah.  He told us a great story once about how he was, you know, he has these panic attacks, and he had his child in the car with him, and something happened. 
[01:04:30]  Remember that?  And he was trying to walk.  Oh, his kid had to go to the bathroom.  So he parks on the side of the highway.  So he parks on the side of the highway, but there was kind of a big, steep drop-off, and kind of rolled down the hill.  He was trying to come back up, and he's having a panic attack.  He thought he was having a heart attack.  Well, because of the OCD issues.  Yeah.  Because his child there, I don't know if it was a boy or a girl, was just doing what a little person would do. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  All over Howie.  Yeah.  As he's falling down the hill.  Yeah.  With the kid.  Yeah, he tried to get to a point where the kid could do what it had to do.  Which, seeing him, knowing him, you would just start laughing.  Yeah.  Like, not at him, just at irony.  Yeah.  All right.  We've got to get the big plug in.  Nicky Six, he's always a great guest.  The Heroin Diary is a year in the life of a shattered rock star.  It's getting really a real good buzz on this book.  Check out the record, too, because we scored a soundtrack to the record, and I started  a new band called Six A.M. around it, and we got a big hit single. 
[01:05:30]  You know, we played a little taste of that, and someone wrote on this feedback, they had  no idea that was your band.  Yeah.  No clue.  Yeah.  So, you're calling it Six A.M.  It's called Six A.M.  But you're spelling six, S-I-X-X.  And Nicky...  Did anyone ever tell you, there's only one X in six?  Oh, now I find out we're not live, and I misspelled my name.  You misspelled your name for so long.  And I got a girl's first name, so I was like, yeah, I'm just...  I'm...  See?  I should have never done...  I should have never made it.  Yep.  Send me back to the farm.  And NickySix.net with two Ks and two Xs. 
[01:06:00]  Hey, thank you, guys.  It's been...  I've had a blast, as always, and next time I come back, I'll come back and hang out, and we'll  see what we can...  Trouble we can get into.  All right.  Very cool.  Absolutely.  NickySix, everyone.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 KROQ.  92.3 KROQ.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, this is David Duchovny.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  More Bob Kelly in studio on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  What are they about to hear here? 
[01:06:30]  I think we're going to talk about girl fights.  I guess girl on girl fights.  And then, did you ever hit a girl as a guy?  No, it's not girl on girl, I don't think.  It's guy on guy, girl fights.  No, it's Bob Kelly just talking about how he hits chicks, I think.  But he says he doesn't hit chicks, but he pushes them around a lot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's what I heard.  There's pushing, maybe some holding.  I can honestly say never.  Never hit a chick.  Ever.  I kicked a girl one time in the crotch, but I was very young. 
[01:07:00]  She took my tire.  I was probably like seven or eight, and I didn't know that you shouldn't kick people there.  I knew she was embarrassing me by stealing my tire.  You knew, though.  Yeah, you've got to leave the girls alone.  Oh, is this where the phrase goon hand comes into play?  All right, cool.  You've got to goon hand her a little bit.  Why don't we listen to this?  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Okay, I must retract that.  I did hit a girl once, but I was a kid.  I explained it in this, and it makes perfect sense, and I am completely vindicated, because  I was a little wussy.  You didn't know the difference between boys and girls at that time? 
[01:07:30]  No.  It's okay.  I was embarrassed, getting beaten up, because my daddy would have been upset with me, so  I had to pick up a big stick and hit her.  I explain it in this.  All right.  So now they don't have to listen, because you just explained it.  No, but it's the whole story of how and why.  It's captivating.  Fascinating.  It's a nice build-up to that.  Yes.  All right.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Girl fights is the latest rage.  Go to YouTube and throw in girl fights.  What is it?  They'll have fun for hours.  It's pretty much high school girls, sometimes junior high school girls. 
[01:08:00]  Throwing hair out of each other's heads.  Beating the crap out of each other.  Yeah, it's great.  And now with video phones and video cameras, people tape it, pop it up on YouTube, and you  just watch as girls pummel each other.  They just grab.  It's usually just one grabs a hunk of hair and just doesn't let go until the death.  Yeah.  But they punch now.  They're like pit bulls, where they just bite, and that bite just never lets go.  Apparently, they've taken it very seriously, the girls, that the girl fight was always  kind of a scratch, pull hair thing. 
[01:08:30]  And now they box.  They punch each other in the face hard.  I backed down from a girl once.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I was going to a seventh grade dance.  Remember those dances you used to have at like the church?  Not the church.  School dances they were.  Well, they had mine in a church, like a gymnasium.  But it was everybody get to go.  All the junior highs met up at this church there, and we'd all go.  That sounds safe.  But you had to be a certain age.  I was in sixth grade.  You had to be in seventh.  And I was trying to lie to the priest, but I couldn't because, you know, he's how old 
[01:09:00]  are you?  And I'm like lying.  She goes, hurry up.  And I told her to shut up.  And she happened to be just one of these girls.  And she went, what?  And she snapped.  And she goes, I'll beat the crap.  And she just snapped and just was literally grabbing me by the neck.  And I just backed down.  What are you going to do?  Take a beating from a girl.  That wasn't happening.  You're in a no-win situation.  Because if you hit back, people look at you like, oh, my God.  Even if I hit her back.  What's wrong with this guy? 
[01:09:30]  But then if you hit her back and you lose the fight, it's even worse.  I was definitely going to lose this one.  This girl.  It's a no-win situation.  I think you did the right thing.  I hit a girl once.  Yeah?  Yeah, when I was probably fourth grade.  I thought you were going to say 42.  Yeah.  Did you hear the four?  The four.  I was 42 at the food important.  Right.  She punched her right in the face.  She took the last block of cheese.  I had to.  My father gave me some great advice but didn't give me enough detail. 
[01:10:00]  He said, if anybody gives you any problems, and they're bigger than you,  it's just a nice fatherly advice after a few scotches.  And I'm talking about me, not him, not my father, a few scotches.  And he goes, here's what you do.  You grab the biggest stick you could find and just hit him with it.  I'm like, okay, sound advice.  Thanks, Pop.  So I go outside.  And in our little development was this big girl. 
[01:10:30]  And she was kind of a bully, but she was a girl.  She was a couple of years older and very tall.  Dykey big?  Yeah, like dykey big.  And she was always, like, pushing us kids around when we were playing.  So she came up to me.  She was giving me some crap, and she pushed me, and I fell down.  So I just got up.  I walked into the wooded area across the street, got this big piece of log that was laying on the ground,  walked up behind her.  I didn't even face her.  And hit her in the back, right between the shoulder blades with a log. 
[01:11:00]  She fell down crying her eyes.  It was the first time anyone ever saw this bitch cry.  She was laying down, trying to hold her back, like get her arms behind her back, crying, rolling around on the ground.  And I threw the log down and did that thing with my hands, like clean them off, and just walked back home.  And I told my father what I did, and he smacked me in the face for hitting a girl.  Did he really? 
[01:11:30]  This is so confusing, Dad.  Relax, Paul Bunyan.  You can't figure this out.  Well, he should have told me.  You don't go out to the woods.  You went to the woods and grabbed the branch off and just came back, and you're a serial killer.  When he said, find the biggest stick you can find, I assumed you get a log from the woods and just pound her across the back with it.  And that's what I did.  I didn't even, like, face-to-face do it.  I just snuck up behind her like a VC and hit her right in the shoulder blades, right between the shoulder blades. 
[01:12:00]  Her air just went.  She was down and out.  And then my father told me, no, jackass, not girls.  You don't hit girls no matter what.  You just went to the woods and got a nice big tree badge and cracked her in there.  First and last time, big branch.  It was big, big, long, a lot of leverage, a lot of swing.  Pop's never had a problem throwing plates of food at the wall, but as far as hitting women.  No, he didn't throw it at mom's head.  No. 
[01:12:30]  I smacked a girl.  I smacked a girl one time in my life.  Yeah, that was the first and last time I ever, you know, hit a girl.  I had all my friends behind me.  She cheated on me with another guy.  And I had her, and I was, you know, trying to impress my friends.  But my friends were all psychopaths, like, literal.  Why wouldn't they be, of course?  No, psychopaths.  So I had her by, like, the collar.  And I was like, you cheated on me.  And they go, hit her.  Hit her.  And I'm holding my arm up right in front of her.  And I'm looking at her like, you hit her, or we're going to beat the crap out of you. 
[01:13:00]  And I just went, crack.  A little peer pressure.  I hit her right in the face.  I still feel bad about it to this day.  Let's call her.  I swear to God, I wish I could.  All I know is that she had a big Horshack afro and a huge nose.  She actually might have been a dude.  I might not even be in the wrong.  I remember she was, like, probably one of the ugliest girls I've ever.  I remember her and her brother looked exactly the same.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, she was probably one of the ugliest women I've ever been with in my life.  And she cheated on me.  I'll show you some restraint after that. 
[01:13:30]  Years later, I believe I was in the sixth grade.  Oh, I thought you were going to say, years later, I was in a courtroom with Dominic Barber.  No, no, we all know that story.  I was in sixth grade.  And this big, again, another big, like, overbuilt girl.  It was sixth grade.  She had a set of on her.  Onions.  Huge.  She came back from fifth grade, sixth grade.  Boom.  She was all fully developed.  Had curves, nice ass, but a big girl, too, like, tall. 
[01:14:00]  Her name was Jerry.  I don't remember her last name, but just Jerry.  And one day she decided, I don't know why, just to kick me right in the groin.  That means they like you.  For no reason.  Whether it meant she liked me or she heard.  I think this was, like, something like I did with the stick.  She had heard, hey, if some guy hassles you, kick him in the groin.  And then decided to just give it a test run to see what it looks like and if it works. 
[01:14:30]  And I just, vroom, right on the ground.  And she walked away laughing.  And if I ever had the reason again to pick up a big stick and whack a big girl between the shoulder blades, it was then.  But, you know, I thought, I'll just let it go.  You probably just weren't near trees.  Yeah.  And I was in no position to grab anything but my, I was in pain.  I remember that pain.  I'm so distracted.  E-Rock is playing girl fight videos like crazy.  Oh.  There are close to 12,000 girl fight videos on YouTube alone. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, my gosh.  Mike and Paramus, what's up?  Hey, Mike.  How are you, guys?  What's up?  I got Anthony Short beat about the time I hit a girl.  Yeah.  I'm in eighth grade.  And, you know, I'm really heavy back then.  And this cheerleader and her boyfriend, a football quarterback, are over there making fun of me.  And she just called me a fat piece of whatever.  I moved him out of the way and I just clocked her. 
[01:15:30]  Nice.  Are we actually talking about beating up women?  Well, no.  It's like your first experience with hitting a girl.  Yeah.  It was so empowering until the rest of the football team beat me down.  It was so empowering.  You felt great.  I think you really do.  Because they go down so easy.  Is it the, what's the opening sequence?  Was it Way of the Gun?  I can't remember the movie.  What's that one with, uh...  I have no idea.  Anyone remember?  I'm not even going to try to make believe on this one.  Sarah Silverman?  I have no idea.  Sarah Silverman? 
[01:16:00]  Okay.  Just gets clocked right in the face?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Way of the Gun.  Oh, it's a great scene.  I actually hit my, me and my chick got into a fight.  This is a true story.  I was, you know, you get into a fight with your girl and you get so mad, whatever.  You'll smash a cop, you'll punch a wall.  But I had raw chicken in my hand that I was cooking.  I swear to God, I was cooking the chicken.  And I went to throw it against the wall.  Like, I'm not, just, you know, forget it.  We're not eating now.  But the chicken slipped out of my hand and slapped her.  It slammed her right in the face. 
[01:16:30]  Wild pitch with the chicken.  But I went, you know when you laugh?  You're just trying to give her a little chin music?  Yeah.  I hit her in the face and it slapped, but it stuck to her cheek.  And it was just kind of sliding down.  So you're kind of like, oh man.  You're like, oh, I don't want to hurt you.  But it's really funny.  What was it, a nice cutlet?  It's like a cutlet.  How do you not laugh at that point?  Because there's a cutlet stuck to the side of your chick's face. 
[01:17:00]  She balled up her fist and came at me.  With the cutlet still on her face.  I had to put all my weight.  I had to put her on the ground and put all my weight on her just to hold her down.  Because that's like the only thing you can really do to a girl.  Yeah.  Is just, you know, weigh them down.  Weigh them down and calm them down.  Yeah, just be like, baby, listen, calm down.  I ain't calming down.  I'm going to beat the crowd.  Listen, I'm not going to let that happen.  It was chicken.  Relax.  All right.  I did accidentally.  Oh, here we go.  All right.  And this is the ex. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  This is the ex.  Oh, boy.  This was when things were going down.  Okay.  You know, I don't know why she decided to get so upset that I would bring my girlfriend to a gig.  One of my band was playing.  And why would she get so upset with that?  I told her not to show up.  It was it was over at that point.  She decided she was going to show up, you know, had a few and started making a scene.  So she, my ex, hated the C word. 
[01:18:00]  Like, I couldn't even say it recreationally.  I remember.  I couldn't call.  I remember.  I couldn't call someone on TV it.  I couldn't.  If I said it, it made an argument that you couldn't believe would last all night until I would whisper.  Women in general hate that word, but it went a lot further.  There was some deep seated thing.  If you said it to anybody, anybody, if I said it to an inanimate character in a video game.  If he said it to someone that, that, that deserved it.  So if I named my kid that word, I wouldn't, I would have never been able to have said, yeah, this is Bob's kid. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  C word.  But she hated it.  And, um, she started mouthing off and making a kind of a scene.  And, uh, my girlfriend did the best thing she could possibly do.  Flipped her the bird and called her the C word.  So, so my ex now lunges at her.  So I step in and, and try to like restrain her arms and get her out of the bar.  As I'm doing it, she trips and her head goes right into the jukebox. 
[01:19:00]  Like Fonzie.  Oh, my head went right into the jukebox.  And, uh, and, uh, yeah, I think she got a cut over her eye.  It was, and, and I, I was like, I was like, the first thing I thought is, oh man, I'm going to be in trouble for this.  They're going to like arrest me for throwing her head through there.  But, uh, and then I thought, God, that was refreshing. 
[01:19:30]  At that point you figured you were all in, so you kicked her a few times.  Let's be honest.  I was just escorted out of the bar.  Let's be honest though.  There's nothing like when you get mad at your girl, giving her a nice goon hand, just grabbing her by the elbow and just squeezing and dragging her out of somewhere.  Goon hand.  You know what I mean?  Just putting that goon hand.  What is wrong with you?  Right on there.  Just, you know when you grab them?  I've never given the goon hand.  You grab them right behind, right above the elbow on that little fat and you squeeze it and you pick her arm up like a little chicken wing and you drag her out. 
[01:20:00]  Come here, I want to talk to you.  But you, see, you're calm, like to everybody around you, but you're pinching that fat and you give her the, come here, I want to talk to you for a second.  And you're smiling as you're walking out.  That's very Italian.  So people around are seeing you smile.  I saw them walk out, they were smiling.  And she was, you know, but you squeeze her, come here, I want to talk to you and drag her right out.  Right out of the mall.  You get into a fight and like, you know, Pottery Barn.  Hey, listen, come here.  She's got four round bruises on one side of her arm and one big round, one on the other where your big meat thumb was.  You got to get a nice goon hand and drag her out of the parking lot. 
[01:20:30]  Because you really can't argue in public.  Let me tell you something.  I was going to the, you ever go to Martha's Vineyard?  You have to take a, I've been there, yeah.  You have to take that dumb ferry.  Ferry, yeah.  Oh, it's awful.  So we go to this stupid thing and I, and I'm with, we're going back.  And I, she goes, uh, would you like something to eat?  And I go, yeah, give me a, give me an egg sandwich with cheese and ham.  She comes back up with tuna and mustard.  Ugh. 
[01:21:00]  Right?  And she deserves to get beat for that?  I didn't say beat.  I never beat it.  Jesus.  I hope you take, stop jumping the gun.  Slap her with the sandwich.  No, but you know, there's like everybody around, all these little happy white families from Cape Cod.  Sure.  And me, and I'm like, I didn't, what did I say?  Did I say turkey?  And she's like, uh, well, that's all they had.  Sounds like a relationship that was in trouble.  You couldn't come up and ask me?  And she's like, listen.  And then they get mad at you, right?  But this is what she did.  She kept me going until I snapped.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  And then I snapped. 
[01:21:30]  I go, listen, all right?  It's not about the sandwich.  All of a sudden, it's not about the sandwich anymore.  It's about the fact that we haven't had sex in three months.  Because I love you.  And I can't have sex with women I love.  I have to hate you.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Back to the story.  It's not my fault I'm having sex with everybody out there except you.  Yes.  Hey, man, I was just trying to give you a sandwich.  Chill out.  But that's what she did.  She goes like this.  What's about the sandwich?  Everybody around was seeing us argue through our teeth. 
[01:22:00]  You know when you grind?  Yeah, you don't want to make a scene.  Then she goes like this.  It was.  She goes, it's a sandwich.  Sandwich.  If you want to fight about a sandwich.  And she starts crying.  And you're like, calm down.  Just calm down.  No, you calm down.  I'm just calming down.  Yeah, you better calm down.  If you make a scene, I swear you will be thrown overboard.  That's when the goon hand comes into play right there.  All right.  That's where you have to break out the goon hand. 
[01:22:30]  Now I get it.  You get the goon hand right there.  You squeeze like, listen, don't you say sandwich one more time.  I swear to God.  I don't care I'm on this ferry.  You calm down.  Come here.  I'm excited.  I want to talk to you on the Lido deck.  Get out here.  We'll take, we'll, we'll, we'll do, we'll deal with this later when we get home.  No, I want to.  Not in public.  If you make a scene in public, I swear I will kill you.  I was never, never been into the public scene.  The public display of hatred and arguing and stuff is so embarrassing to me because it's, 
[01:23:00]  I know how entertaining it is when it's someone else.  There's nothing better.  You just watching a couple argue.  There's nothing better.  You stop.  You, you stop with, drop what you're doing.  If you're like the mall and a couple's arguing and you have to get to a store, you'll turn  around and follow them just to hear, uh, the argument.  Yeah.  You go get, see where it goes.  Go right to the food court, get a couple of little, uh, little chicken teriyaki's on  some toothpicks and go.  You're just eating.  It's like a movie.  Follow them around. 
[01:23:30]  Right.  Nothing better than seeing a couple fight.  But to be part of that, to be center stage.  Yeah.  No.  No.  Never been into the scene.  I've done.  And believe me, with my ex, it was a scene everywhere.  I just have to give a preamble before we went out at night.  It's like, look, I know we're, we're going to be going out.  Like every, everything's fine right now.  We're both sober.  This is great, but we're going to go out now, no matter what happens, let's remember  right now, is there a problem?  Like I'd have to do this beforehand.  We went out.  No.  I go, just remember that there's no problems. 
[01:24:00]  So later on, after a few drinks, don't think that there's a problem.  It's, it's just the booze and pass all that by.  How is that going to help?  I don't understand.  Was she hearing nuts?  Because heroin?  No.  After a few shots of Jack Daniels?  Because you're going to remember the conversation you had when you were stone sober after you  had a few pops.  But that was, I was trying to put it in like a, a suggestion.  One of those like mental suggestions that I could pull out later through hypnosis.  So she would, we, we'd be out drinking. 
[01:24:30]  She'd do a few shots of Jack.  But he'd bend spoons.  He'd be a freak.  Yeah.  Bend some spoons.  Mind control.  I was giving her a mental suggestion.  Mind control.  So she'd do a few shots.  And then before I know it, it would be like, you know, you and whole and blah, blah, blah.  And just an argument would start out of nowhere.  And then I'd try to bring back what I said.  I said, remember earlier today when I said there was no problem?  I go, that's still right now.  There's no, there's a problem. 
[01:25:00]  It's yeah.  I don't like how Anthony is completely sober in this conversation.  Oh no, I was drunk, but I never slurred when I was drunk.  No, Anthony is pretty amazing when he's drunk.  Really?  All the best drunk.  You understand, right there.  I get happy.  Right there, when she went, yeah, yeah, you grabbed the goon hand.  Goon hand would have solved all of it.  Yeah.  I should have used the goon hand a little more.  Little goon hand.  The Italians and the blacks made the goon hand up.  The black pimp.  The blacks called it something else.  Started with a C. 
[01:25:30]  I saw some things.  I saw some things back in the day.  Saw some things.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I saw some things.  Look at him.  He's looking down.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it's very uncomfortable when Anthony decides to go down this road.  Wow.  I saw some things.  Now, you were actually, you didn't have a girl around that, did you?  Yeah, absolutely.  So you had a girl, and you had to watch this relationship over here.  Yeah, yeah, and then, yeah, my chick at the time decided to take Ant's wife's side.  That made for a lot of fun.  And, boy, their relationship crumbled pretty quickly after that. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, of course it did.  How are you going to have, we're radio partners.  Right.  My ex is now, you know, hated by me.  I heard that my ex was driving Anthony's ex-wife to the lawyer.  I'm like, are you insane while you were with her?  Yes.  Goon hand.  That's where it comes from.  Goon hand.  You should have had the goon hand.  Come here.  I want to talk to you.  You don't drive her anywhere.  That was pretty much the last straw.  My favorite was right when the proceedings started. 
[01:26:30]  Divorce proceedings started, and Opie's chick and my ex, his ex-chick and my ex, future ex-wife  at the time, used my Amex card to get a cruise.  Both of them.  They went on a cruise together.  His chick.  I was already living my own life at this point.  His chick used my Amex before I can.  I'm like running to the phone to cancel the Amex.  Too late.  Wham.  Cruise is on there. 
[01:27:00]  Jeez.  Wow.  Yeah.  Your chick got a free cruise on Anthony.  Yeah.  No.  It wound up causing Opie because he felt so bad he paid for it.  Yeah.  I paid Anthony back in the end, but it was just like, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  And that was after she lifted $40,000 from the bank account.  All I had in my life was $40,000, the most money I'd ever earned in my life.  After 45 years of life, he owned that.  Had it in the bank.  You know how good that makes me feel?  Everything.  Honestly, God, do you know how good you just made me feel saying that? 
[01:27:30]  45 years of life, you had $40,000 in the bank.  That was it.  And that's it.  But you were happy, right?  $40,000 large.  I felt nice.  Felt good about it.  She took it.  Took all of it and went on a cruise on my dime.  In the middle of divorce.  With her friend, and God knows, I can only assume what went on on that cruise.  Some dreadlocked guy with no tan lines.  All I could think of is she was going to show me.  She was.  She's some guy who wears a skirt.  That's how manly he is. 
[01:28:00]  All right, listen.  Hey, lady.  Our listeners are the greatest.  We try to talk about Obama and how he might be the first black president.  There's no one calling.  They're like, whatever, dude.  Who gives a crap?  But here the lines are packed.  We talk about hitting women.  Look at these phones from all over the world.  Yeah, there's so many guys.  You know a bunch of guys from Philly.  Dude, I invented the goon hand.  We invented steak and cheese and the goon hand.  In Philly, when they're being married, he goon hands are up the aisle. 
[01:28:30]  That's like part of the wedding ceremony.  Listenership in Philly is way up right now.  They can't get enough of this.  Goon hand her up the aisle.  Come here.  This is the guy you met.  Go get her.  The father goon hands his daughter down.  Just your owl.  Well, it's the only virus spreading across America.  We'll continue in just a bit here.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock. 
[01:29:00]  WXRK, New York.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  This is Stuart Copeland, and you're listening to your radio, the worst of O.P. and Anthony.  Hey, this just in.  Lady Di is here.  Yeah, Lady Di is here.  Homeless Lady Di.  We haven't seen her in four years.  She used to do a lot of things for our radio program.  She's fallen on bad times, very bad times.  She's like living behind a path mark in Jersey, hanging out with the other homeless. 
[01:29:30]  Homeless.  Homeless, and having sex with the homeless.  With the Railroad Romeo, that they call this guy.  He seems to be the hit of the homeless up there behind Pathmark, where the train platform is.  They call him the Railroad Romeo, and she's kind of hooked up with that guy.  And everyone's saying, wait till you see her.  We haven't seen her in four years, and they're saying she looks absolutely awful.  She's always been a fat mess.  Oh my God, that's her? 
[01:30:00]  She's coming into the studio right now for the first time in four years.  Oh God, okay.  Lady Di.  First of all, no, no, no.  Somewhere else.  What?  Ant, there's a mic next to you right there, Di.  I said, Ant.  Nope.  Nope.  Yeah, stand way over there.  Right there is good.  Right there by the light switches.  Hi, Di.  Over there.  Hi, how are you, Jim?  Back there.  How are you?  Back there.  Who are you?  By the light switch.  Against the wall.  There you go.  So we can see you.  Right there, so we can see you in the light.  Okay.  That mic's not on. 
[01:30:30]  It's not?  We're trying to figure out which one's that one.  Did we just get her on a mic that we know works?  Oh my God.  We have like 15 mics in here.  We still can't figure out which one's.  I'm going to go over here.  Or what yet?  I'm moving over here.  There we go.  How you doing, guys?  What's up, Lady Di?  Don't you look good?  Yeah, I look wonderful.  Right.  We've got to start the death pool on you.  Wow.  Yes.  Get on the microphone more.  Okay.  Your face is bloated from the alcohol.  Bloated and red.  And red.  What's with the red?  That's not sunburn. 
[01:31:00]  The red is the sun.  That's what that is.  The sun?  The sun.  Yeah.  That's what that is.  She's been in the Hamptons.  Sunning.  And your hair is really greasy.  Your hands look like cadaver hands.  They're all dirty.  Look at the dirt under your fingernails.  Look at all the dirt under your fingernails.  When did you say you wash up?  What happened?  Yeah, I do wash up.  Well, how are your fingernails all dirty?  That'll still happen.  No, it won't.  It doesn't happen if you stay clean.  Look, we all wash up.  Look, there's nothing happening under our fingernails. 
[01:31:30]  It doesn't happen if you stay clean.  What are you doing?  What are you pointing at, Iraq?  What are you doing?  This isn't even a radio bit anymore.  What are you doing to get better?  I told you.  I'm going to try to go back to the SAI program.  When?  So this way they could find me a shelter again.  When?  Very soon.  When?  Very, very soon.  When?  You're not.  You're saying very soon.  Very soon means nothing.  Probably tomorrow.  I have to go back and go.  Probably doesn't work either.  Oh, okay. 
[01:32:00]  What happened to your bling?  Why didn't you go today?  Why didn't you go yesterday?  Because I have to make an appointment with this lady to go.  What?  So it's probably going to be today.  Probably means you're not going to do it.  No, I will do it.  I have to go back to Westwood.  You're not a good adult friend.  You're not a good liar.  You're not good at it.  Yeah, you haven't gotten good at it yet.  Yeah.  Probably not.  You've been rousted by the cops yet?  No.  No.  You've got to learn how to lie if you're going to be rousted by the cops.  I see that on episodes of cops. 
[01:32:30]  It's pretty good.  And they're all horrible liars.  And you're tugging at your hair.  Your hair is turning into like dreadlocks.  You look like Eddie Vedder in 1992.  If Eddie Vedder was punched in the face a few times.  You've been mugged.  I'm going to do something about this.  No one believes you in this studio.  You know that, right?  No.  Just like your own family, no one believes you anymore.  I'm going to have to prove it.  No one believes you.  Marion doesn't believe you.  Even Marion gave up on you.  How old is your son?  My son right now is 15 years old. 
[01:33:00]  That's good.  So, he's doing good.  He's staying with my dad.  Of course, yes.  How do you think he feels about this?  He doesn't feel too good about this.  I'll tell you that.  You're a homeless embarrassment.  Why don't you stop it?  I am going to stop it.  Why don't you stop it?  I am going to stop.  Have you had anything to drink today?  No.  Kenny, has she had anything to drink?  The booze is emanating off her purse.  Yeah.  Really?  No joke, right?  It'll be off my jacket, but not off of me. 
[01:33:30]  What about last night?  Last night, yeah.  You were drinking?  I had a few drinks last night.  A few drinks with the boys, right?  Yeah.  Down there at the train station platform thing?  Any sex last night?  No.  No sex last night.  Any drugs last night?  No.  Jimmy, is she on drugs too?  I can't tell.  No.  No, I'm not.  I really can't tell.  I don't do that.  You're not smoking pot?  No.  That fat face?  At the very least, you're smoking pot.  You're smoking lots of weed and drinking yourself to an early death.  What happened to you?  Do you see what has happened to you? 
[01:34:00]  Do you see how you have fallen from, you know, we would goof on you and all, but at least  you were employed.  You had a home.  You still had your kid with you.  Right.  And now look where you are.  How did that happen?  How did it happen?  I don't know.  No, don't say you don't know.  You lived it.  How did it happen?  Give us the process here of the chain of events that led you to be here like this.  Okay.  This is what happened.  All right.  I winded up falling behind on my rent. 
[01:34:30]  How?  Okay.  Well, I was working at Dunkin' Donuts and I had to pay like over a thousand dollars a  month plus utilities and everything.  I couldn't afford it anymore.  How did you lose your job before Dunkin' Donuts?  Didn't you have a good job?  Yes, I did.  And what happened?  I lost it.  How?  They were cutting back over there and I was one of the people that they cut back with.  Do you really, you tell, like you tell other people this stuff, but do you actually  buy it when you say it?  Well, it's the truth.  They just let me go. 
[01:35:00]  That was it.  So, how about this?  If somebody would take you-  It was my fault, too.  That part was my fault, too.  What part was your fault?  What did you do wrong?  Well, you know, not showing up for work and everything like that.  Yeah.  Well, that will get you fired.  Now, why weren't you showing up for work?  What's up, Kenny?  I'm just laughing at what a pity she is.  Why weren't you showing up for work?  I wasn't showing up for work because I would stay up late at night. 
[01:35:30]  Doing what?  Go on the computer and stuff like that.  Go on the computer.  Stop acting like you were Googling things.  You were drunk.  Just admit that it was your drinking.  Your drinking has led you to where you are.  See, that's the whole point we're getting to.  You weren't programming things at two in the morning and you got caught up sending DOS files.  Your drinking has brought you to this point.  We got Bam in studio.  Hello, Bam.  Yeah, Bam, go right to this mic.  It might work now.  Share a mic with her.  Is it working?  Okay, yeah, it does work. 
[01:36:00]  Bam, one of our pests, one of our really good pests.  We got the O&A pest thing happening.  You got Lady Di this morning.  Yeah, it was absolutely horrendous going up on those train tracks, picking her up.  Now, how did you find her?  Well, I found her when we did the crib segment.  Right.  I know that area.  Yeah, we did a homeless cribs with Lady Diets.  It's on one of those websites out there that we can't promote yet.  It's on one of those websites, yep.  Would you check into a detox today if someone would take you there?  Yes, I would. 
[01:36:30]  Don't act like you have things to do.  You would go today.  If there's a detox in New York that would take you, you would go into there.  Oh, there is?  I'm sure there is.  Of course there is.  If there was, would you leave right from this studio and go right there?  Don't act like you don't have things to tie up.  Why don't you know?  Because I have to go back to Westfield.  I have to go to the SCI program.  Marion's on the line.  Oh, my God.  Lady Di's best friend from childhood.  Even Marion gave up on Lady Di.  They've been friends for her.  Don't put the headphones on her!  I'm not that dirty. 
[01:37:00]  Yes, you are.  I don't want lice.  I smelled it in my car on the way in.  It was horrific.  I don't want lice.  Lady Di, you're now emanating a homeless woman smell.  Congratulations.  Congrats.  Yes.  You are.  Yes.  Congrats.  Maybe we can have some kind of headphones that are used just for this purpose that will  be alcoholed.  E-Rock will just hold the headphones up so Lady Di can hear Marion.  Turn it up loud so she can hear Marion.  Marion, what's up?  Hi, how are you?  Hey, we got Lady Di in the studio. 
[01:37:30]  She looks awful.  How did you get her there?  Bam picked her up at the train station.  How'd she get here?  How are you doing, Marion?  Oh, nice to talk to you.  What did you do to me Friday when I tried to talk to you, Diana?  Uh-oh.  I didn't do anything.  You still got your black eye?  No.  What happened?  Oh, what happened, Marion?  No idea what happened.  Ask her.  What happened?  It's from the sun.  That's what happened with her.  The sun punched you in the face?  No.  The sun has a hell of a right hook.  I'm sure your own would like to.  Oh. 
[01:38:00]  Yes.  Is Paul with you?  No.  Who's Paul?  Uh, the guy that's been dumping her on a train track.  Yeah, Paul is this great influence.  No, no, no.  Don't bring anybody else into this.  So Paul has been a great influence.  Wait, what does Paul do?  He dumps her on a train track when he doesn't want to hang with her.  Marion, stop it.  That's not true.  Come on.  And he's having sex with her.  I don't know about that.  We know that.  We saw the video clip.  No, no, no, no.  He was not on the video at all. 
[01:38:30]  Diana.  Diana.  I'm right here.  Listen to me.  What are you doing there?  You know what?  You got a lot of nerve going there.  What do you think they're going to do?  They're not going to help you.  You don't listen to nobody.  You don't listen.  Me and Allison tried to talk to you last Tuesday.  What did you do?  You stared at us like you're in some f***ing space.  Hey, hey.  Watch the language, Marion.  Marion.  I like it, though.  Marion.  Marion's giving her a little.  I need to help you.  So many times, Allison's trying to help you. 
[01:39:00]  What do you do?  You're like, okay.  I don't need rehab.  I don't need this.  I don't need.  You do too need help.  You need rehab.  You told me this a thousand times already.  Okay.  I got you.  You know what?  Let me tell you something.  I don't want to see you dead.  I don't want to see you get bit by all of these animals that live in the wild.  That's going to happen.  Why are you freaking up your ass?  You were just telling me about the raccoons that used to run over you while you're sleeping.  They don't bother you.  They don't bother you. 
[01:39:30]  How does that make you feel that they root through garbage and ignore you?  They had a fire up there the other day.  They had a fire up there, huh?  Yeah.  Where is she staying at?  They had a fire on Sunday.  Yeah.  That must have been entertaining.  It's like TV for you guys.  I didn't see that.  I wasn't there for that.  Where were you?  I was staying over at a friend's house.  I was talking to the Star Ledger guy yesterday, and he told me that they had a brush fire up there where you're staying at.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You're really looking like Throw Mama from a train.  God, that's exactly.  I mean, it's not even fun.  And it's the same age and everything. 
[01:40:00]  How old are you?  She's 44.  Oh, my God.  You look a lot older than that.  Tell him that.  How does she look to you guys?  She looks awful.  She's all sunburned, isn't she?  She's staying at sunburned, but it's also the alcohol completely taking over her body.  Now, when I seen her Tuesday, she had her face as well red, but when I seen her Friday night to try to talk to her again, she had a black eye.  Does she still have a black eye?  It's swollen.  I don't have a black eye.  It's swollen.  It's from the sun. 
[01:40:30]  You had a black eye.  It's swollen.  You can see it.  You can see it.  Now, how did you get the black eye?  No one punched me or anything like that.  How did you get it?  Stop lying.  You fell into a train.  How did you get it?  No, I did not.  How did you get the black eye?  How did you get it?  All right.  I fell down.  Okay.  And it wasn't makeup because you don't wear makeup no more.  Now, you lied and said you didn't have a black eye right up until you just said you fell and got a black eye.  Stop lying.  It's still a lie.  You got punched in the face. 
[01:41:00]  A man punched you for some reason.  No one punched me.  You're lying.  What happened?  You were sleeping with somebody and he sobered up?  No.  No.  Diana.  Yeah.  You know, what'd you do?  Take a train over to New York and walk them to the studio?  No, Bam picked her up.  Bam picked her up.  What?  And Elizabeth?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a good egg.  And that's the first day I don't have my Wi-Fi with me at work.  It's so bad I can't hear the show.  How about putting on the radio?  We're on 92.3 here in New York. 
[01:41:30]  I know, man.  I told you guys last week.  All right, shut up.  We don't care.  Oh, my God.  Now we remember why these two used to hang out.  Exactly.  The mousetraps are here.  Start setting them up.  Thank God.  We lost Jim.  Jim was going to take you to detox right now.  Put him in rehab.  I'm trying to get her to go back.  There's Frank in Yonkers, though, that says the same thing.  He works for detox.  They would take her.  I mean, I think of up.  All right, shut up, Marion.  Shut up.  Frank in Yonkers, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  All she has to do is be brought up to Yonkers. 
[01:42:00]  Marion.  Marion.  Hold on, Frank.  Marion.  Marion, shut up.  Marion, shut up for a minute.  Marion, are you listening to me?  Shut up.  Shut up.  We're talking to Frank.  I forgot that these two don't know when to shut up.  Marion never knows when to shut up.  Marion, we are talking to a gentleman named Frank from a detox center.  Could you shut your mouth for a second?  I'm sorry.  I was talking to myself.  No, that means just shut up.  I don't care.  Now, shut up.  All right, Frank.  Hello, guys.  Yes. 
[01:42:30]  If she can be brought up to Yonkers, I'll give you the address off the air.  They would admit her.  They'd do a rapid detox.  They'd clean her up.  But the thing is, she's going to want to have to stay there because, unfortunately, the stupid  laws in New York, once they're checked in, they're under their own power.  Yeah, of course.  They can leave if she wants to.  Now, she could do this right from this studio.  She can be driven over there, dropped off, and they would take her.  I won't even drive her.  Of course.  Of course.  Shut up, Marion.  Marion, we told you to shut up. 
[01:43:00]  Marion, we told you to shut up.  Marion, shut up.  Shut up.  Holy Jesus.  Shut up.  Shut up for a second.  Frank.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Kenny, shoot me.  Thank you.  Someone just shoot me.  Frank.  Yes.  They would take her?  I can almost guarantee it. 
[01:43:30]  Put me off there, and I'll give you the name and number, who to speak to, and I'll make  sure that someone sees her.  But here's the problem.  Here's the problem.  Lady Di, if we can get you right from this studio to a detox center, nonstop, no stops.  I'm talking right out this front door to a detox center, would you go?  Why are you hesitating?  I don't know.  Why?  Why?  What are you afraid of?  I'm scared.  Because it's the, scared of what?  It's the first step of getting your life back in order. 
[01:44:00]  What are you scared of?  What are you scared of?  You sleep and get raped and punched by homeless guys.  You have raccoons crawling over you.  No, I don't.  You should be scared of death at this point.  Yeah.  Because that's where you're heading fast.  You are at the bottom of the barrel.  There's nothing left to be scared of.  Do you understand?  You're done.  Look at you.  You are a Bowery bum.  You're a bum, Jules.  You're a bum.  Someone's saying that you look like Babe Ruth if he was homeless.  Diana.  You know, baseball was wonderful to me. 
[01:44:30]  The last, like, speech he gave when his throat was pouring out.  Do you remember that?  Yeah, you remember that.  I remember that.  Of course you do.  Of course you do.  It happened.  Diana.  I saw films of it.  Oh, wow.  That's wonderful.  So why don't you go to a detox?  Why wouldn't you do that right now?  Westfield stinks even when you're, you don't have to stop at a Westfield.  There's nowhere to stop.  You have no loose ends.  That's where my welfare person is.  So what?  She has to readmit me.  She'll be fine.  I'll readmit you.  You go to a detox and they will get in touch with your welfare person.  They get in touch with people. 
[01:45:00]  They told me, they told me, they told me to go through her.  They told me to go through her.  If you walk into a detox today, nothing bad is going to happen.  Right.  I told you to walk into a detox.  You're not going to lose welfare money.  You're not going to get billed for anything.  You're not going to, you'll get help.  And all you need right now, the only thing you need is help.  Because you're a wreck.  Anthony.  Yes, Marion.  I told Diana last Friday night to go up back into the hospital.  We got two hospitals here in New Orleans.  She can walk back.  She can walk into either one of them. 
[01:45:30]  All right.  Hold on.  We got Jim in Brooklyn.  No, no, no.  They let me go from that hospital.  Diana, I told you to go back because I told you I called somebody.  Let's say hi.  I told you to come back.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jim.  Jim.  Hey, Jim.  Jim tried to help out Lady Di in the past and it went nowhere.  He called me, too.  Yeah, Jim from Brooklyn.  Good morning.  Hey, Jim.  Good morning, Jim.  Diana, I'm hoping you can hear me.  I'm going to ask you a very simple question and you're going to decide whether I'm ever  going to bother with you again. 
[01:46:00]  Are you an alcoholic?  Yes, I am.  Yeah.  I admit it.  Oh, cool.  I admit it.  I am.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Yeah, she finally admits it that she's an alcoholic.  I've been admitting it.  Haven't we told you in the past?  Go ahead, Anthony.  Go ahead.  Haven't we told you in the past that the road you're on,  and this was when you still had a house and a job,  that the road you were on is going to lead you right here to where you are now.  Homeless. 
[01:46:30]  We said you're going to lose your home.  You're going to lose your kid.  I told you the same thing, Anthony.  And what did you do?  No, no.  That's not going to happen.  Oh, no, no.  Oh, that's not going to happen.  And now look where you are.  Yeah, I know.  So why don't you listen?  I told you the same thing, didn't I?  So what are we doing?  Marion told you the same thing.  What are we doing?  Because this is the last...  I told you the same thing for how many years?  What are we doing?  Oh, my God.  Shut up, Marion.  Marion, hold on.  So why don't you go to a detox?  You have no loose ends to tie up.  You have nothing to do in Westfield.  And you have somebody in the studio that will take you right now. 
[01:47:00]  You can go right now.  Drive you over there.  Right now.  They'll drive you right there.  I went to rehab.  Instant help.  I went when I was 18 to a rehab.  Why don't you just go?  I went.  Ben, are you going to drive her?  I'll drive her.  Absolutely.  See?  You got transportation.  By the way, thank you.  And you got a place.  There's nothing you have to go back to in Elizabeth.  You have a broken mattress on abandoned train tracks.  And you woke up this morning asking for the first thing you asked for from me was,  I need beer and cigarettes.  Oh, is it?  Oh, really?  That was the first thing she asked for. 
[01:47:30]  That's the truth.  Beer and cigarettes.  You get the shakes.  You know?  You get the shakes.  That's what happens.  Do you really?  This is your life.  Did you get her a beer?  Shake, shake, shake.  Shake, shake, shake.  Shake your booty.  Why don't you go to a rehab today?  At least go to detox.  You want to have a little rehab going to party?  We'll get you some beers.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Who's up there with her?  Who's up there?  You know, we're not going to explain who's here.  All right.  There's a lot of people.  Listen, we got to move on.  She came by herself.  Yeah, she came by herself and a band. 
[01:48:00]  Patty is up here too, Marion.  Huh?  Patty is up here.  Don't touch anything.  Patty actually was homeless for a short time and she was able to slap her pathetic life  together.  And look, at least she's clean.  And Club Soda Kenny's up here too.  I'm up here with you.  Oh, Patty's got something to say, Marion.  You go to the rehabilitation center.  You got to follow their rules and do everything they say.  You can't just walk in.  They have zero tolerance.  They're drugs, alcohol, everything.  Way to sell it.  Shut your face.  I'm sure you know.  I've already been through this. 
[01:48:30]  The rehabilitation.  Look at Patty giving tough love.  No kidding.  I'm sorry.  You got to cooperate.  And you don't.  She doesn't.  You're right.  She's angry.  All right.  Listen, what are we going to do?  Because we've spent enough time on this mess.  Yeah.  Well.  She said you'd go.  She did say she'd go.  You'd go.  Jim, where can we bring her right now?  Diana.  Hold on, Marion.  Marion.  Brooklyn.  Didn't that guy give you the place up in Yonkers?  Well, Frank.  Okay.  He's still on the line.  Yeah.  Put Frank on hold and have Travis get the number of the detox center. 
[01:49:00]  Give them a call and see if they take people.  All right.  Anthony.  Yeah.  Can I talk to her for a minute?  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You are on.  Diane.  The problem is with the welfare.  I have to go see the street.  I have to go see.  She's lying.  You're a liar.  You're lying.  I'm not lying.  Yes, you are.  Stop it already.  Everyone's on to you.  You're not fooling anybody.  The ISAI person told me I have to go back to welfare. 
[01:49:30]  You'll get your welfare.  No one's going to take your welfare because you went to detox.  Shut up.  Do you think anybody is believing the fact that somebody is telling you not to go to detox right now as soon as possible?  There's a professional out there that is supposed to be taking care of you.  No, don't go to detox.  Diane.  That's your top priority.  Diane, what did we talk about?  Last Tuesday, me, you and I.  I know.  I know what we talked about.  What was it?  Getting raped by homeless people?  No.  What did we talk about Friday when I saw you? 
[01:50:00]  We talked about me going into a detox.  Well, go back.  Don't be afraid.  Go back.  The sale at pennies?  All right.  What did I talk to you about?  Mary, you tell me this a thousand times already.  Okay, I got you.  You don't listen.  A thousand times already and you haven't done it.  That's why she keeps telling you a thousand times.  But Allison's even getting up.  Here's the old expression.  I hate people like you.  If they're ready, you can't say anything wrong.  If they're not ready, you can't say anything right.  Done.  Why don't you just go?  Go.  Shut your mouth.  Just go.  Stop lying and go.  You've disgraced everyone. 
[01:50:30]  Now here's what will happen.  Son, just go.  Now she's agreeing to go.  The second Bam gets her in the car, she's going to go.  No, I got to go here.  And Bam, call us immediately because that's what will happen.  I will not drive her anywhere other than that place.  If she says anything.  There you go.  She's going to tuck and roll and fly out of your car and look better for it.  She will not be able to get out and we will go to the rehab.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Marion, thanks, I guess.  Hey, guys.  Good luck.  I tried to.  All right.  We know you did.  Talk to you later, Marion.  You're a saint. 
[01:51:00]  Try to contact me if you can tomorrow or tonight.  Okay.  All right.  I just wanted to slap our life back together so we can screw it up again.  It's so funny to watch the long, hard slide down.  Please don't do that.  Yeah, like.  You know, I know you were at your dad's Saturday.  Shut up.  This isn't a telephone.  We're doing a radio show.  If you have anything else to tell her, call her.  How come I never hang up on Marion?  Yes, we'll keep you posted.  I'll call you next week.  Oh, my God.  Oh, we can't wait. 
[01:51:30]  Okay?  All right.  Yeah.  Bye.  You're a godsend.  I'm hearing the mousetraps being set back there, and a couple of them are going off,  and I just heard, oh.  Wow.  Someone just nailed their hand in there.  Yeah.  Well, how much money do you need, Lady Di?  Yeah.  How much do you have on you right now?  I have a dollar.  You want a few bucks?  You have a dollar.  You want a few bucks before you go to detox?  Give it to Kenny so he can throw it as he's scheduled.  We can't give it to her today.  Can't give it to her today.  This is money that if she earns it today, she will get it in a few days.  No way do you get the money today. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, you don't get it today.  Absolutely not.  Or it's going right to booze.  No, absolutely not today.  But whatever she earns today, we're not going to lie.  We're not going to steal from you.  Where'd you get the buck?  I had it for a while.  For a while.  That's how you know you're in trouble?  The welfare person gave it to me.  A what?  The welfare person gave me $20.  Oh, that was nice of that.  We're not giving you any money today, but if you do something like this, you'll get money  when you get out of detox.  We will get you all money actually when you come out.  We'll have money waiting for you when you get out.  There you go.  Okay.  Yeah, we'll get at least, I don't know, $12 together.  Can I get money for Lysol for my car? 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, no problem.  So you guys are going to head out and try to get her to rehab?  I think we got some addresses.  Yeah, Travis got some addresses.  Call up the show and we'll see how you do, the progress you make.  Okay?  Absolutely.  I think she'll go.  I think she'll go.  All right, Lady Di, later.  Okay, I'll talk to you later.  All right.  There it is.  Bye, Di.  All right.  Good luck.  Bam, keep us posted.  I shall.  On what goes on.  Let us know.  You got a cell phone, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, let us know when you get to the detox place, when she gets dropped off, if she actually 
[01:53:00]  goes in.  You don't understand how big of a liar she is.  Oh, yeah, we do.  When I got in the car this morning, she told me that everything she said on the crib segment  about screwing other, I don't know if I can say that, but, with other people on the railroad  tracks, over the railroad, all that stuff panhandling.  It wasn't true.  Yeah, it wasn't true.  It's not true.  I lied when I was on the videotape.  That's what you're saying?  She is a compulsive liar.  All right, well.  And a silly goose. 
[01:53:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  92.3 K-Rock.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Rock!  Good orange, Jimmy.  Jimmy.

Before we get to Brother Joe, we've got the pit bull story you heard on the way in today.  Yeah.  Cute little story about a couple of little pit bulls. 
[01:54:30]  Anything good ever happen with those dogs when they're raised in an environment where they're  just trained to kill or maybe protect people's drug stash, and then they'll let to wander  the neighborhood?  It's a great dog to have, though, because if you're a pet owner, everybody wants to pet  your stupid dog.  Yeah.  No one wants to pet a pit bull.  No.  You're left alone.  But is it really...  It's not really an animal that you own around people that want to pet it. 
[01:55:00]  You own it to protect your drugs or your gun stash or your crack house.  You make a great point, because I live on the Upper West Side, and it's dog owners all  over the ball field.  I hate all of them.  And what are they?  What kind of dogs?  Oh, the tiny little yip-yip dogs.  Little yip-dog.  Little old ladies with plastic bags over their hands picking up after their dogs.  Hybrid yip-yip dogs. 
[01:55:30]  Because they got dog allergies.  So if you take this dog and have it f*** this dog...  Oh, hey, watch the language.  I believe you should say, if you have this dog and mate it with this dog, you get...  All right.  Right.  You get a dog that doesn't make you sneeze.  It's wonderful.  This dog doesn't have the dander coming off of it, the dander that I was so allergic to. 
[01:56:00]  Right.  Shut up, translucent skin.  We need someone in my neighborhood with a pit bull just walking around the neighborhood  scaring the crap out of the yip-yip dogs.  Yeah.  And their stupid owners.  Just biting the ears off the naughty children.  With that hand with the plastic bag.  You would have to put...  I couldn't do it.  I would get the ticket.  Just give me the ticket.  What's a ticket for having your dog go on the sidewalk in New York City?  I know it's a lot of money.  It's $10,000.  It could be a couple of dollars more than that, Jim. 
[01:56:30]  I think it's only a couple hundred dollars, to be honest.  Is it?  Yeah.  It's worth it, then.  I'm sure one of the cops will call in and let us know, but...  Because to put that plastic sandwich bag over your hand, walk around, let your little thing  go, and then to pick it up...  Mm-hmm.  I don't care that you got plastic over your hand.  You're still feeling the consistency, the heat, you know, that whole ick, and it skeeves  me out.  Yeah, I'm not into that at all. 
[01:57:00]  Skeeve.  And then they dress up their dogs.  They treat their dogs better than their own kids and other people.  Little booties and little sweaters.  Sweaters in the wintertime.  Sweaters?  How about little coats?  Coats.  They got coats now for the dogs with hoods on them.  Do you know dogs have been fine for millennia?  They've been fine just cruising around with their own fur.  They own fur.  Here we go.  Johnny Rock, very pissed off.  He's in Queens.  Johnny Rock, go. 
[01:57:30]  Good morning.  How are you?  How you doing?  We're doing great.  Johnny Rock cakes.  Listen, I've had a pit bull for years.  Yeah.  I've trained dogs since I was a kid.  Mm-hmm.  You can't blame this dog.  I mean, look, I bring my dog to work with me every single day.  Yeah.  And this dog, I had to get an alarm because the dog will not guard my truck.  Okay?  And every pit bull owner I've ever met will tell you the same thing.  They're terrible when it comes to guard dogs.  That's why you never see a pit bull as a professional guard dog like you do a Rottweiler or a German Shepherd. 
[01:58:00]  Or maybe because they're a little harder to control.  I mean, they're good dogs, but when they get really mad and they lock down, it's kind of hard to do anything.  Any dog, any dog is fine as long as it's well-trained.  That's what I'm saying.  Pit bulls, though, and Rotties and dogs like that, if they're not well-trained, they're dangerous.  It's like if you have a – what the hell are those little dogs? 
[01:58:30]  A terrier, one of those –  Chihuahua.  A chihuahua, let's say then.  Thank you.  If you have a chihuahua that's not well-trained and it goes berserk, really, what's it going to do?  You know?  Just one kick.  Just one kick takes care of the situation.  That thing is flying.  Those are dogs, though, that if they're not trained well, just like a German Shepherd or a Pinscher or any of that,  if they're not trained well, they can be quite deadly.  They've just become popular with people that don't train their animals. 
[01:59:00]  They train them to kill.  By the way, $50 to $250 ticket.  Is that it?  That's about it.  We got a guy who's a pit bull advocate.  Me a bag of shells.  Big John.  Me a bag of duty.  Hello?  Big John.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Thanks for taking my call.  Hello.  Did we have a choice?  Real quick.  The last caller took some of my thunder away.  Listen, about the pit bulls.  I own one for a while.  What's his name?  My girl's name?  Yeah.  Yeah, Caesar. 
[01:59:30]  Of course it is.  Caesar.  Something powerful.  Of course.  And the thing is, real quick –  Snuggle.  It's got creamy stuff on its back like a salad.  If I may, these dogs were not made –  like I said, the guy said a lot of my stuff.  It wasn't made to be people aggressive or guard dogs.  They weren't made for that.  These dogs, believe it or not, are family dogs.  But a certain group of people ruin these type of dogs.  What kind of people are those?  Well, I'm about to get into this.  No kidding.  You know what I'm talking about.  Every person in America is scared of pit bulls.  It had to start from something. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, it had to come from somewhere.  I don't know how many people scared of the old poodle.  Right.  Or the old chihuahua.  If I may, Cocker Spaniels, Chows, and German Shepherds have more dog bite instances than  the pit bulls and the robs.  Yeah, but they are what you call nips.  Oh, look out.  Be careful.  He nips.  Yeah, but you see, you guys got the wrong impression with these dogs because, you know,  every time a pit bull or a robs or a robs or a bite somebody, it's in the news.  Yeah.  When any other mixed breed or any other dog very rarely makes the news.  Yeah, but you're not understanding what I'm saying. 
[02:00:30]  When a Cocker Spaniel bites you, you go to the medicine cabinet.  It could do a lot more damage by all means.  Yeah.  But they weren't bred to be people aggressive.  A hundred years ago, when it was legal to fight these dogs, you guys don't know this,  when a dog used to bite the owner in the heat of battle.  I know this.  I used to participate a hundred years ago.  Wait, wait, wait.  They would put the dog down and it would bite the owner in the heat of battle.  Right.  I said that earlier.  They don't know how to do that.  No, but I said, we do know that because I said that earlier.  And I was having an argument with a guy who was a dog advocate. 
[02:01:00]  And he said that they had to change those laws because to talk about them is extremely boring.  Believe me, these dogs are great dogs.  They're killers.  Have them all put down.  That's right, sir.  They're hurting our children.  All right, Big John.  There's an earless child running around.  Those two little iPod buds.  They're going to collect dust for the rest of its young life.  Let's go to Dan at Westchester.  He has a different story.  His glass is just spinning off his nose.  Contacts are nothing.  Dan, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, man? 
[02:01:30]  Hey.  Yes, sir?  I had a little pit bull.  Name was Socks.  Socks in the box.  Aw.  You know.  Big head on.  Hey, hey, hey, sir.  Sir.  Ah, you curse.  Sir.  If we can, uh, penalty.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Cursing.  I bring it to my father's house, right?  And he has a chow-chow tied up.  Chow-chow's a little bit nasty, you know?  Look at the pit bulls over there.  I come out.  The dogs are fighting.  The pit bull grabs onto the chow's neck and just goes limp. 
[02:02:00]  And the chow's, like, flopping around.  This thing is laying there.  I'm like, holy crap.  I grab it.  I'm punching the crap out of this dog.  I will not let go.  Finally, I mean, I'm just beating it.  I take the chain.  I wrap it around a thing's neck.  I put one foot on it, and I'm pulling it.  And eventually, its eyes open up real bright.  It kind of looks over at me, and it lets go.  I'm like, oh, all right, all right.  So I pick the dog up.  It's like, like, limp.  I throw it in my truck.  I go back to check on the chow-chow.  It was all right.  He had a lot of hair. 
[02:02:30]  So I walk back over to the truck, and there's the pit sitting in there, all happy,  wagging his tail.  Didn't even know he was being vicious.  I'm going to shoot you.  Right.  I ain't having that dog around my house.  That's a dangerous animal.  All right, everyone's trying to defend the pit bulls.  We're just scared of them.  Yeah.  It comes down to this.  We're scared of them.  They're the devil's dog.  We got the audio of the 10-10 win story.  You want to set this up again, Anthony?  Yes, a pit bull attacked some children.  One child lost his ears, which I know is hysterical. 
[02:03:00]  It's only hysterical because the poor little guy is grabbing one.  And then the dog says, roll over.  And he does.  Cover the other one, stupid.  He lost his ears.  And they went to interview the owner of the pit bull.  And he, I don't think, wanted to be interviewed.  Sounds a little angry.  The owner is showing little remorse after his two pit bulls viciously attacked five school kids getting off a bus and a man who tried to help them.  Can I just talk to you briefly?  Can I talk to you briefly about- 
[02:03:30]  Get the f*** out of here!  Get the f*** out of here!  Get out of here!  The f***!  Just want to find-  Did you have anything to say, sir?  I'm just asking him a question.  Witness Doug Bedulf says the children were screaming.  The dogs started going into the street.  The traffic stopped.  The kids were running all directions just trying to get away.  And another guy stopped his truck.  He got bit up. 
[02:04:00]  They were bit on their hands, legs, and backs.  Police immediately ground one dog, but the other ran off.  Neighbor Lori Crilly.  The parents of these dogs should be prosecuted.  You have these dogs.  You know you have them.  Take care of your animals.  Steve Sandberg, 1010 Wins, in the Avenel section of Woodbridge.  There you go.  But that's the clean version, because 1010 Wins had the story this morning.  Well, look, we get news reports that come in all the time.  Paul McCartney, Heather Mills, separating.  Why? 
[02:04:30]  That's it.  It says, one thing says, Paul McCartney back on market for a whole woman.  This is a real story.  Get the AP story.  Apparently, it's on CNN Showbiz.  And now, he's going to have to give her how much money?  His kids, every time someone that rich gets married, your kids must want to strangle you.  Yeah.  There goes the inheritance.  Be bleeding it.  How many millions is she going to get for throwing her leg open for, what, a year?  You mean Paul McCartney was married to a girl with a wooden leg and he broke it off? 
[02:05:00]  Sit down.  Thank you, Kenny.  He broke it off.  Thank you.  Oh, that's great.  I don't even know if she had a wooden leg or just one of those stupid Lieutenant Dan silver ones.  She just tapped with her cane when she showed up at the party.  The magic leg.  Wow.  Yeah, she's going to do quite well for herself, I'm sure.  How long were they together?  And they had a kid, right?  Did they?  Oh, no, no, no.  They lost a kid, right?  Oh, jeez, that's right. 
[02:05:30]  Wait, did they end up having one or not?  I believe she recently miscarried.  Well, lost a kid, saved $50 million.  However you want to say it.  She did recently miscarry.  Yeah, they did try, though, right?  Although the delivery's got to be difficult with a girl with one leg.  You've got to have two doctors, one guard on the unprotected side so it doesn't just fly off to the left.  You need a doc there.  They don't want a slider.  The sheets are coming out of a broken log flume.  It would be dangerous. 
[02:06:00]  Hey, Brother Joe's here, and the Paul McCartney story's hitting as we speak.  We've got to play Lady McCartney.  Ah.  You got the actual story in front of you, though?  Yeah.  Can we screen that and make sure there's no naughty language?  I think it's all right.  Representatives of the couple declined to comment but said in a statement expected later in the day,  former Beatle Paul McCartney and his wife Heather Mills planning to separate after four years of marriage.  Hmm.  McCartney, 63.  An anti-landmines campaigner Mills, 38. 
[02:06:30]  Gee, I wonder why she's an anti-landmines campaigner.  I think that explains a lot.  That really does explain a lot.  If you had one eye, wouldn't you be an anti-throwing pencil campaigner?  Hopscotch advocate Mills.  Yeah.  And the Liverpool-born musician and songwriter made his name in the Beatles. 
[02:07:00]  They actually have to explain who Paul McCartney is.  Who is he alongside?  Wait, John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and George Harrison.  This is groundbreaking news.  Penning classics such as Yesterday, Hey Jude, and The Long and Winding Road.  Someone is actually saying, Oh, that's who that is.  Oh, Paul McCartney.  Jackass is in the news.  It's just awful.  He married Mills, a former model, who had her left leg amputated below the knee after she was hit by a motorcycle in 93. 
[02:07:30]  In a lavish ceremony at an Irish castle.  The way that's written sounds like she had her leg removed in a lavish ceremony at an Irish castle.  Well, shouldn't she be an anti-motorcycle advocate?  Or how about a pro look both ways?  Stop just traipsing out into the middle of the street.  McCartney's second marriage is widely reported to have caused friction with his children. 
[02:08:00]  Of course.  To Eastman, who include fashion designer daughter Stella.  So, yeah, every time he gets married, millions, millions right out the window.  Bill from Waterford on the instant feedback.  Heather Mills won't win any money from Paul McCartney.  She doesn't have a leg to stand on.  So, the jokes have begun.  We kind of knew that was coming.  I don't think you're going to help it.  Oh, here you go.  McCartney and Mills had a daughter October 2003.  They did.  Thank you, Ben. 
[02:08:30]  God, how annoying for the other kids.  With that...  63 and he just can't stop.  Oh.  She probably wanted one.  She wanted a Beatle kid.  I don't blame her.  Who wouldn't want a Beatle kid?  Absolutely.  Comes out with that little haircut, hon.  I'd hold my mother down.  Not even for a Beatle kid.  Just from the black bassist from the Stones.  The guy who they never show.  The drummer that played all the drum tracks on all the albums that Ringo didn't play on.  Please excuse me. 
[02:09:00]  Hold on.  You know what I've come to learn?  I can't look at Jimmy when I'm trying to get a joke out.  Because you smile.  You put this smirk on like, screw this up, idiot.  He does make it tough because he just wants you to screw up.  He wants it so badly.  He doesn't want you to get a really good laugh.  That's not true.  And the second he gets a hint of it.  You put the pressure on him.  The second he gets a hint of it, it's like a shark with a little bit of blood.  The smile goes all the way up.  His snout starts going around.  His eyes roll back white.  There's nothing funnier than somebody flubbing a joke miserably. 
[02:09:30]  Of course.  Of course.  All right.  Here we go.  Brother Joe in studio.  We'll go to break with Lady McCartney.  The abuse has just begun on this story.  I think this one has legs.  There you go.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Lady McCartney used to have two feet. 
[02:10:00]  Plain to see your lower halves income's lead.  Saved lots of money.  Got a great excuse.  Can't have price on pedicures, boots and shoes.  Every night she takes off a prosthetic's.  Hops in circles when she tries to run.  Yes, she only has to tie one shoelace.  She has a stuff. 
[02:10:30]  Lady McCartney always has a pet.  Woodpeckers, they gather beneath her dress.  Yes.  Lady McCartney, outside on the deck. 
[02:11:00]  Get the rapist, try my shoe in on your leg.  Tuesday afternoon, she's looking sexy.  Then I lift the skirt and see that stump. 
[02:11:30]  Close my eyes and stand the size while effing.  She has a stuff.  Lady McCartney, or should I say Eileen?  How you gonna curtsy when you meet the queen?  The L.P. and Anthony Show.
