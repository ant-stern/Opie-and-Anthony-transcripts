<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show’s "Worst of 2012" broadcast was a chaotic mix of recurring comedic bits, celebrity interviews, and personal anecdotes.  The show opened with a compilation featuring Ted Sheckler, a recurring character whose rambling, nonsensical inventions (like a sleep apnea mask emporium with a fishbowl mask and jet engine, and a disastrously timed Halloween store) were punctuated by the exasperated reactions of Gregory and Samuel. This segment also included highly offensive jokes about the Jackson family.

Next, Will Ferrell, Amy Schumer, and Jim Norton appeared in studio.  They discussed Ferrell's improv background at The Groundlings, contrasting it with stand-up, his experiences on SNL (including bombing sketches), his Spanish-language film *Casa de Mi Padre*, and humorous anecdotes about social media and the unexpected popularity of the name "Marv Gresto." This segment concluded with a clip of repetitive and offensive chants.  A brief interview with Billy Corgan followed, touching on his career, his criticisms of Rolling Stone magazine, his songwriting process, his interactions with Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love, his refusal to use auto-tune, and his thoughts on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's questionable inductions.

This was followed by a segment featuring Jim Norton as "Uncle Paul," which consisted of extremely graphic and sexually explicit jokes, particularly concerning child molestation.  The jokes were often shocking and offensive, blurring the lines between the character and Norton himself, and included fictionalized accounts of Jerry Sandusky's actions.  This segment continued with time travel-themed scenarios, further exploring Uncle Paul's character in highly inappropriate contexts.

The "Worst of 2012" segment continued with a bizarre, sexually suggestive monologue filled with graphic descriptions of sexual acts with a young boy, punctuated by made-up onomatopoeia. This was followed by an in-studio interview with Donald Sutherland.  Sutherland, who gave the hosts the middle finger upon arrival, discussed his career, his opinions on social and political issues (including the Occupy movement and taxation), his son Kiefer Sutherland, and his role in *The Hunger Games*. The hosts frequently interjected with off-color jokes, often making fun of Sutherland's age.

A shorter segment recounted the hosts’ attendance at Sam Roberts’ wedding.  This included descriptions of the venue (a malfunctioning barn), the ceremony (a short ceremony with a Beach Boys song and impressive vows from the bride), and observations about the guests, including "Stinky" and "Giant Face." The hosts made numerous sexually suggestive jokes about the bride and groom, detailed their interactions with other guests (including Sam's mother and a hostile bartender), and discussed a potential class-action lawsuit about catering hall workers' tips. The segment also included descriptions of the post-wedding activities, including a visit to Pepe's Pizza, a highly embarrassing incident involving one host’s unexpected defecation in a hotel bathroom, and observations about various guests, including "Troy Kwan."  The honeymoon in Hawaii was then discussed, focusing on Sam's frugality, including avoiding upgrades, tourist activities, and choosing a basement hotel room.

Another segment focused on Sam's frugal Hawaiian honeymoon, detailing his cost-cutting measures (Walmart snacks instead of lunches, avoiding activities like zip-lining and helicopter tours, etc.), his and his wife Jess's defense of these choices, the overall cost of the trip, and humorous anecdotes, including a run-in with a parrot and encountering a supposedly Ozzy Osbourne-signed broken toilet seat.

The final segment of the "Worst of 2012" featured a producer, Gary, who refused to come on air to discuss a contest he believed was rigged.  The hosts humorously discussed strategies to deal with Gary's refusal, including sending E-Rock to distract him and Opie physically walking past Gary outside the studio. The segment concluded with Opie successfully walking past Gary, described with exaggerated and humorous commentary. The show then abruptly ended.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  in studios such as billy corgan from smashing pumpkins donald sutherland stops in uh what else  happened our own not sam on twitter got married this year plus went on a hawaiian vacation for  his honeymoon we'll review all that opie had some run-ins with management and a few other things  here and there but right now we're going to start off with a compilation of one of jim norton's  friends slash characters and we're going to look at the year of 2012 for the one and only ted  sheckler opie and anthony's worst of 2012 what is the national math competition some kid just won 
[00:00:30]  the national math competition what do they do there they do problems mathematics five times five  25 you're the champion i think it's more of a thousand dollar scholarship chad congratulations  when did you start loving math how old since i was a very small boy oh ted you love math i certainly  do gregory are you part of the math fucking competition i wanted five years in a row  really five plus two seven not bad thank you trophy please but but don't the uh don't the problems get 
[00:01:00]  more complicated than that ted my mathematical skills are unparalleled you give me a math problem and i'll  give you an answer that's what i do samuel all right nine divided by a tree it certainly does  and divides very well whole bunch what's the answer though three three times three is nine nine  wait oh no three is the square root of nine what about nine times three is 27 nine plus three is 12 
[00:01:30]  nine minus three is six nines and threes are my specialty gregory as long as they're nines and three  okay what about nine next to three looks like 93 unless you flip it it's 39 what's six plus seven i  wouldn't know i don't deal with those two numbers what nines and threes i said samuel what about uh  three divided into nine i already said that one i only answer a question one time goes in three times 
[00:02:00]  well there's not many other fucking examples left i won the national last championship on the three  nine category how about 39 times three i wouldn't know i only deal with threes and nines is singular  numbers or how they look together nine over three looks like a nine over three three minus nine yes  you can't do that negative six you'll bag of shit this is only eight worst of 2012 all right so that's  all we know about the jacksons we don't know much that video was terrible very strange situation going 
[00:02:30]  on a cunty aunt and a cunty niece fuck all of them yep teddy jackson never made anything  teddy jackson never gave me a motherfucking thing yo i was at a whole motherfucking time joe joe was  punching me too gregory i don't remember seeing you ted jackson six originally but i was too  motherfucking good i would sing a b c but then i would forget the rest of the lyrics i would just  start yelling d e f while michael went back to the motherfucking beginning that shit ain't right 
[00:03:00]  yo my good friend dr conrad murray was very helpful to the family i brought him aboard  oh you were the one that brought him in i said michael's having trouble sleeping dr murray  do you have anything used in surgeries  really do you have anything that will knock out an elephant this man needs to take that before he  sings and dances and provides glee for all this is ona's worst of 2012 what are you talking about 
[00:03:30]  nothing i just uh just thinking about getting some um apnea masks just wish there was a place to go  to get them but there might be yeah where are you having trouble sleeping  gregory are you are you snoring are you gasping for breath is your tongue slowly murdering you by  collapsing your tongue's a murderer maybe you could help out jim norton because he's having a problem 
[00:04:00]  sleeping ted nice i've heard that how about you samuel is your soft palate collapsing like london bridge  it's a song we sing at ted's sleep apnea mask emporium oh wow your soft palate's falling down  falling down your soft palate's falling down my fair lady we haven't fixed the my fair lady part  yeah that doesn't quite it certainly doesn't happen it's a great point you'll get there though 
[00:04:30]  yes there are so many masks there are so many new fangled sleep apnea masks what kind of different  masks do you need well you need constant air blowing into the sinus so what i'm doing is i've designed  the fishbowl and you squeeze your head into it like a diving bell yes you do exactly like a diving  bell but the hard part is cramming in the pillow and putting your head backwards and we have a  rolls royce jet engine that blows air up your nose into your throat that sounds a little bit uh well 
[00:05:00]  not only dangerous but probably expensive to buy a jet engine it's a four hundred thousand dollar  it also sounds very loud ted it certainly is that's a great point gregory how the fuck are you gonna  sleep but a jet engine blowing air into your face  so nobody no one sleeps so how does the mask even work well yeah at least you're breathing for pete's  sakes oh well he's got a point there your tongue is murdering you anthony it's collapsing it collapses 
[00:05:30]  it's conspiring against you how does it collapse it just kind of  walls back you know the tongue was told to stand down  you must push your because the tongue's not on your side bubba sounds like a conspiracy yes it's  it violated the most basic protection things a tongue can do it collapsed on top of the throat  murders people reggie white's tongue is a murderer i also have a very good idea for drivers where you 
[00:06:00]  could take a hose and allow the exhaust to blow into your nose directly oh ted now you know very  dangerous come on you know that's carbon monoxide i don't know i've given quite a few of those  machines out nobody has called to tell me how they liked it lots of ingrates they're probably all  snoozing well you never get calls from happy people so i guess they're doing good that's a  great point and the whole fishbowl thing what happens is sometimes the jet engine blows dust  into their skull swelling so people can't get it out so they have to break it you have to break your 
[00:06:30]  fishbowl every morning yes you do are you expecting to make money off this idea i certainly am gregory  all i got to do is sell 300 of them and i'm rolling in the dough rolling in the dough  uh so that's uh what is it ted's ted's sleep apnea mask emporium anthony and what do you sell  sleep apnea masks and apparatus 
[00:07:00]  all right all right and then there's the one where you could just duct tape it over your nose and  mouth because those straps are so uncomfortable well i think that would  cause a lot of breakouts and stuff yes it's an excellent observation because i offered the  strapless mask and people really wanted it so i'm like here just tape this on your face  that sounds like a bait and switch to me that's a good point that's what the lawyers are calling  the gen itch is very loud yes very loud it just blows air directly into the fishbowl which your head is 
[00:07:30]  in and you're on a pillow that doesn't sound very well thought out at all i've been told it's  uncomfortable i certainly won't use it and what about fuel like how do you fuel a jet engine like  that it's got to be it's not very cost effective you're gonna have to go to ted's portable gas pump  emporium and buy yourself a little gas pump well you need jet fuel for that yes you do anthony not  easy to get ted very difficult gregory it sounds uh you'd be surprised how much expensive how much money  have you lost in this idea so far so far i'm down 2.5 million in research and lawsuits because 
[00:08:00]  people are going blind when their life partner breaks the fishbowl in their head because they're  suffocating i think it would be hard to get zoning for a very difficult i never thought of any of  these things but i figure there's a lot of plane crashes and things just let me have those engines  i'll save you the trouble and how safe could it be to have a turbine winding in your in your yard  like that with an animal yes you'd be surprised how angry people get when their entrance are missing 
[00:08:30]  because they they tend to jam the engine they get curious oh mama look air no stay away from that  mama giant swirly thing yes could uh yeah definitely uh yes and then there's a scream and a loud clunk  and a splatter against the wall and darn it you're going to be up for weeks not sleeping and gasping  and grieving you might want to put uh baby proof that ship put a fence around it probably should 
[00:09:00]  maybe put a fence around that ted well i had a warning sign posted if you're under the age of two  stay away oh that's that's gotta work thank you very much very good another emporium that's gonna  not do well ted so far the financial aspects are not as i'd hoped i figured i'd sell these things  and be rolling in glory roll what's your stock up to what is the emporium stock up to well the  share is worth four million dollars but i only have one and i own it one share yes my portfolio is not 
[00:09:30]  good four million one i invested a lot of money in soybean hats why soybean because i think they're  delicious you can wear a hat stay dry and then have lunch that was the tagline right oh my god  oh ted never learns no he's um another bad idea not yet yet another horrible idea this is ona's  worst of 2012 a halloween store in our neighborhood yeah that's that joint uh just stays there with 
[00:10:00]  nothing in it for a year and then it opens up once a year they gotta make all their money well yeah  because no one else is renting the space yeah so the halloween people uh rented every year i'm opening a  halloween store oh ted ted i bet you it's some kind of emporium yes it is gregory it's ted's spooky  okey goblins and ghouls halloween emporium spooky okey yes it is anthony i open it on october 31st 
[00:10:30]  at 8 30 p.m well that's kind of not smart people wait to get their halloween needs how many costumes do  you sell i i have about 40 000 for sale and how many have you actually sold six  well they were actually stolen off the truck  don't you think it's a little late like people already have the  30 on halloween night they're gonna start rolling in to purchase their goodies  you should open it up now ted no i don't want to right this is too high gregory

[00:12:30]  you're there if they're just walking down the street yes i'm afraid of a riot gregory so i'm trying to  keep it under my hat or a wig as it were lol  wig as it were wig as it were wig as it were this is only age worst of 2012 all right well here's  the guy himself talking about ted will enda this fake stunt yeah we grew up in an age where this  shit was on tv and and the person could die it's gotta be tethered then don't do the then don't do 
[00:13:00]  your stupid stunt yes fake stunt week or sign away and promise not to sue yeah yeah i'm lawyers  again here's what it is too it's not it's probably not even him and the station it's the station's  lawyers believe me but it's probably the lawyers came back and said well you know what if he if  anything happens we'll probably be sued for broadcasting something that uh to fuck somebody  up that affected them like i imagine how many lawsuits would come in i was watching and when he  fell it affected me and i can't sleep now and i'm suing abc it's it's it's it's more of that 
[00:13:30]  overthinking uh shit litigious overthinking stuff that might happen that's what shut us down from  anything the the possibility that something might happen i refuse to use a net gregory ted i refuse to  i'm ted will enda and i'm the greatest tightrope walker in this part of town at least are you are  you going across niagara falls i most certainly will not do that i get very frightened when i 
[00:14:00]  see lots of water but i like to keep i go a couple of feet above the ground 30 feet in length and i'll  go right across once in a while i'll take the old dipsy doodle fall what's your greatest walk my greatest  walk is when i go to the side or sometimes i'll just kind of put my crotch on the rope and guide myself  very quickly across the rope what do you walk across what's that what you walk across a cement  barrier i put up it's only two feet wide and i haven't built and i walk across it with my arms 
[00:14:30]  flailing wildly it doesn't yeah it doesn't really sound that dangerous it's very dangerous if there's  not a lot of wind my friend walks next to me with a fan and blows it on me it keeps me cool  so you don't believe in uh being tethered i would never tether myself except unless i was very high  then i probably would i don't want to fall and hurt myself Gregory i don't know why they put it between 
[00:15:00]  buildings that's very high you're gonna hurt yourself well that's the whole thrill of it that's  not the thrill of it i like to know that i'm gonna be fine i'm going to do a walk i'll talk to you in  about two minutes bye bye i've fallen 71 times oh wow yeah yes i even spilled my coffee once  i swallowed myself i certainly do i get thirsty up there up there you're how high up are you  sometimes between 35 and 45 inches wow but it requires great balance with the fan blowing in 
[00:15:30]  my face right and a cup of coffee in one hand and a crawler in the other how wide's the rope i have  a two-foot cement thing built thing it's two feet wide but god knows what could happen yeah this is  only eight worst of 2012 we gotta watch the olympics when does that start uh this summer but it's not  no it already is that if that was the last warm-up game that means it's happening really soon i don't

[00:19:30]  broadcast there's a million of them there's a will they show the david tyree more than just a catch  oh more than one and a half times or less than one and a half times uh i think they'll only show  it once well now what if they show it twice in one sitting like they show it and then they show it in  slow motion again that's more than once yeah i'm gonna say two yeah not show a clip like that just  one time there you go but they went with one and a half start wait when will they show it though  it discount pregame too uh kickoff to final whistle oh excluding halftime

[00:23:30]  showing us she's been doing stand-up for like six months six months and she did a little right  in that corner for us yeah right in the corner she lives in order to feel how it is to be a comic in  the early it's a tough it's a tough room i mean literally it really is a tough corner in a tough  corner and she did material she stood up and did material which is pretty ballsy because i wouldn't  be able to do that no yeah that's she's obviously a sociopath is that your real hair yes okay  no follow questions no i just want to know did you just stand up i did i did i i um i did it very 
[00:24:00]  painfully you started doing it or after you started no i did it for i did it poorly for like a year  and uh um maybe got 15 minutes of material right that's a lot for a year you ever sexed with amy  me oh god i thought maybe it was him yeah okay a tough crowd she won't tell us tough crowd yeah  imagine i'm like when he left i'm like it was well it was well it was well no i had i had some 
[00:24:30]  excellent star trek material oh nice so did i for years my opening joke was an awful star trek alien  what was it what was it come on it was humiliating um it was something that but it was such an obvious  set up like yeah it was something like you know star trek they would always meet these aliens that  speak english and like you don't know it's going to be it'll be some miami joke after like he's  still trying to sell it i'm still looking for that target you know i'm trying to find some redeeming 
[00:25:00]  value it's it's going to work one day one day you'll find it you just did like improv after that  like from stamp to improv uh no i well i was doing stand-up and then i found uh the groundlings  groundlings theater on melrose and they had a whole you know you could take their classes and  and i i immediately found out that i was i was more suited for that plus when you bombed you  weren't alone right when you bombed you're with a group of people yeah yeah there's no one to play  you can walk off stage going what the hell was that what were you doing yeah immediately point 
[00:25:30]  the finger and what's what's the rule in improv you don't say no or you always go with what you're  always exactly you can never deny something exactly right what's the word amy yes and oh yes and  which is how sexting is supposed to go yes right you say something and then somebody's supposed to  continue okay she had a terrible sexting experience recently yeah the guy was an  asshole the guy did not yes and me yeah he's like uh excuse me but yeah which is really i have other  ideas i where i want this scene to go did he did he write my word what's going on here pretty much he 
[00:26:00]  just wrote back question marks i am fanning myself yeah it was really disappointing yeah  i think improv is hard like i i find that scarier than stand-up like to be able to go out there and  just uh i've watched some bad improv is unwatchable and good improv is fucking awe-inspiring right  exactly yeah good improv feels like you're watching a magic trick yeah it's it's incredible but you're  right it and and you have to go through the bad to get to the good feel good yeah we all came out of the 
[00:26:30]  groundlings some great people um like phil hart is phil hartman or pee-wee hartman jennifer coolidge  pee-wee herman jennifer coolidge uh uh uh lisa kudrow um unfamiliar uh no no okay not ringing any  bells no no who are the ones though that never you never hear from like i was here well the groundlings let  me uh blast off some that's like what about joey pepetone yeah he's in boca now not doing a whole lot  isn't john candy was he ground no he's second city he was second city but there's the groundling 
[00:27:00]  second city and then uh ucb now it's ucb those are like the three big ones right three three factories  of comedy yeah if you want to make it go right there just guarantee pay your money you're in your  teachers who were in your class the year before but that's the thing with improv you it's just like  stand-up and that you have to you can kind of seem like you have to suck at it for a while i've  seen friends who graduating shows at ucb and they they can't find the end to scenes so they  literally just put the lights out so they move on to the next scene they shut down the electricity 
[00:27:30]  because it's that uncomfortable kind of like an snl sketch when they just bring the applause up yeah  what do you do when you're bombing an snl sketch because that to me is the scariest thing because  i've never seen anybody break the fourth wall and address it like they're actually really good at not  yeah wow this is going nowhere i just yeah i know for me in dress rehearsal i if the audience if it  was not working the tendency is to speed up and just get off off the stage but i would just purposely 
[00:28:00]  slow down and torture the audience if you hate this and hate me now i'm just you know what i'm gonna  make it twice as long that's amazing that's balls i don't know what i don't i don't know what why the  masochistic side of me would would allow that but i was just like okay you hate it you're gonna hate  it a lot more do you have a trick for not breaking um do you like think about something really sad or  you just when you're in the scene i'm always thinking about things that are sad oh my god 
[00:28:30]  i found out he was the darkest dude no i don't know i i just have been uh able to you know kind  of commit to something but yeah yeah yeah i'm not immune to it but yeah have you ever in a sketch  have you ever ruined it laughing or ruined it by breaking the fourth wall uh i you know i've been  lucky that the times i've started breaking uh at least on saturday night was was usually when i was  wearing a beard of some sort so i could kind of hide my laughter all right keeping you know my 
[00:29:00]  beard from falling off so uh uh uh in fact this that that blue oyster colt cowbell sketch we did  if you if you watch it yeah if you watch it i'm totally i'm i'm just laughing but i have a big beard  on so you can't tell and everyone else is laughing yeah that was one that really okay i'm okay but  you know that's a hard atmosphere we've been you know daryl's been on yeah colin obviously a million  times that's a really you you you can either take that or you can't because that seems like a very 
[00:29:30]  very hard atmosphere to survive in if you're not thick-skinned yeah you you have to be you know it's  just you're shot through a cannon and that thing and you have to uh i mean we were lucky when when i  was hired we you know we had eight new cast members a whole whole new writing staff so we were  yeah we were all thrown in together and we didn't i didn't know any better no one expected anything  either it was like oh saturday night live let's see what these clowns can do totally and then it  ended up being like amazing i mean the worst part of it the worst part of it was the big uh 
[00:30:00]  press conference we had to do we're like warren littlefield and we're like in front of all this  media and we're just all sitting there and we're all sweating and nervous and in our little  brand new clothes that the network's dressed up and so what funny little sketches are you going to  be doing hey what kind of wacky sketches what's your plan what you know what are you like and we're  just like oh my plan i'm just hoping not to get fired i just want to get picked up yeah so do you 
[00:30:30]  have that fear at first that you're going to get dumped is that like scary the first few times like  where they cut a sketch like the first time you're supposed to be on oh yeah yeah i mean you know once  again like like lauren he had to use all of us so he couldn't uh there wasn't a time to you know  really pick favorites or anything like that so um so we were kind of all used a bunch at the beginning  and uh and yeah and if and you know yeah you're kind of bummed if you're in one thing and but then  but then later if you've been on the show long enough you're like oh i'm only in two pieces great 
[00:31:00]  oh yeah you get lazy i don't gotta go to rehearsal all right um the rolling stone article that was  just out about you yes it made it sound which i haven't read oh it's great yeah yeah yeah you  sound great in it okay good yeah everybody likes you everybody likes you yeah everybody really likes  you yeah but they did the interviewer painted it like you've had this very charmed like existence  yeah yeah yeah yeah did that yeah i kind of i mean let's face it there's like we're saying there's 
[00:31:30]  there's just as many people i can think of at the groundlings yeah who have you know he's got the  just as funny as me automotive shop yeah so when i got hired at snl i'd come back to the theater and  and downplay it because you feel kind of good i'd be like yeah it's okay it's all right yeah living  in new york yeah i don't know is it scary there yeah it's scary yeah it's uh there's nothing to do  there aren't any good restaurants or anything anyway how are you you good yeah yeah wichita has been  really good to me you got that geico commercial okay yeah great so it's like it's tough to stay 
[00:32:00]  in touch with those friends right it's uh you know but uh i just did a movie with zach galifianakis and  we were just talking about how you know it is a game of inches and that we both just got any other  move or false step we literally could be doing you know being extras and whatever and just trying to  make make a living here's how you know zach is famous yeah yes i'm working on my extra here's how  you know zach is famous i was in a casino uh recently and uh i fucking saw the the hangover pinball 
[00:32:30]  machine and zach is in a is on is on a slot machine i'm sorry yeah yes i'm like that's how you know  you're famous when you're on a slot machine in some random casino the hangover slot machine yeah yeah  yeah uh what happened with joan rivers she said something recently and it's like how can anybody  be pissed at you for real you know not recently that was uh that was a long time ago a long time  ago and i this writer was like any anyone ever say anything bad and i just go well there was this  one time this weird article where yeah joan rivers called me out out of nowhere and for what 
[00:33:00]  talked about when we met and i was rude to her and i'm like i don't i don't even know i don't know  what she's talking about it and then i i was trying to figure out when did we ever even meet  and then i figured out the only time was on when she used to do the red carpet  for like the golden globes and i the only thing i could track it back to was we were doing the the  red carpet and the uh the time was running out for when you had to get in because the show was about  to start and her producer was like just walk in go into the live shot and she's talking with mike 
[00:33:30]  nichols and diane sawyer so i just walk into the live shot thinking she knows i'm going to do it  and she's like hello hello do you do you know who these people are i was like yes i do they're  very famous oh hello mike nichols hello yes very important yeah we are all important famous people 
[00:34:00]  they're totally laughing and they're like well hello and then she's like  yeah but how could she not get that hilarious i think she just didn't know taking her red carpet  duties very seriously yeah i don't know that was the only place i figured out why didn't you read  the article do you not read stuff about yourself or you just haven't gotten to it just lazy yeah  sheer laziness no i i will read it i just yeah you get involved in a lot of uh a lot of like  underground shit now too uh on the internet just kind of friends of yours throwing yeah throwing stuff up 
[00:34:30]  online uh what what made you go down that road um just you know just you know funny or die has been  this great kind of playground for for stuff like that and uh and just it i think it kind of  scratches that itch you still have from doing sketch comedy where you have an idea and it's not really  it's it's not really good for anything but a stupid four minute thing on the internet yeah but  it's amazing together and and yeah and take a half hour and shoot something and you know but it's 
[00:35:00]  not i mean i've i've filmed a couple of things with funny or die and they are it's an elaborate  like a yeah they're like here's your call time here's your call sheet yeah you know you're like isn't  this the internet wait a minute yeah i did my my own makeup they're like oh well we're starting  over because we're a real thing you know it's no joke funny or die yeah it's a whole uh well-oiled  machine there was another comedy website which i had done something with florentine on um and i  i forget what it was even called yeah and it was doing okay right but then that video with 
[00:35:30]  you came along funny or die landlord and wiped that site off the map my mom just sent me the landlord  i'm like wow you're really on the cutting edge right you're ahead of the curve and she did not like it  by the way oh she was against yeah she was against hey how much spanish can you because i'm kind of  amazed that you did a movie where you're speaking spanish for real uh yes well spanish is my first  language oh my gosh yeah i finally i've all these movies in english i've done phonetically 
[00:36:00]  so i'm finally just showing off the spanish yeah are you gonna do like spanish radio interviews and  stuff like i have no no no sadly i just uh i learned it for this movie you know i mean i i took it really  seriously because i didn't i didn't want the joke of the movie to be that i spoke spanish poorly right  so i wanted to be that you you sat down you're like wait he's really speaking it sounds sounds  halfway decent so uh so yeah i had to work you know probably a month prior to the filming and then i 
[00:36:30]  would literally the the uh the translator would show up my house at five in the morning we'd drive to  the set and go over the lines and then drive home and start the next day's work and were you having  nightmares in spanish i totally was yeah yeah i was dreaming in spanish and uh all these things but uh but  it was the only way i could kind of do it to to to make it authentic the movie's really funny i  thought i was at the south beach comedy festival oh okay so it was like that was a great crowd actually  yeah and what an interesting crowd because it's you know like the real telenovela stars were there 
[00:37:00]  watching it it's intense is it what's it about it's uh um it's kind of it's like telenovela meets  a bad mexican spaghetti western and it's you know it's one of these heightened epic stories of  you know two brothers trying to save the honor of their ranch that's you know fell on hard times  and diego luna's my brother of course yeah natural we've been bugged for years when you guys  could do a brother movie finally finally happened um and he comes back to help you know he's he's gone 
[00:37:30]  off and as an international businessman and uh comes back to save the day but turns out he deals he  he's a narco traficante oh no yes ooh yeah and my character does not like it uh you're bringing  the family name down what are you doing so it's you know it's all that all that kind of stuff did you  shoot in mexico at all or no we shot in the mexico of southern california chatsworth yeah same 
[00:38:00]  valley simi valley yeah mexico's scary lately there's a lot of stuff happening that's kind of dangerous  not familiar i don't know yeah all right frightening man no spring break in mexico city no no no i feel  like i'd be a good drug mule just for you know in case anybody's simply for the room you could  hold the balloons i just feel like i'm equipped she's the only one that can bring a hail of pop  i don't want to pat myself on the back but uh you're looking for a balloon holder 
[00:38:30]  and will and i have worked together one time and i thought we did very well together we did  crowd sketch right oh gosh yes when you were the worst name of all time oh that's right yeah legendary  it was uh will played the lawyer uh pete wait what was his name come on pete bentley  i think that was colin gave awful names and he goes on purpose yeah and mine was marv gresto  how do you remember marv gresto that's because it was it was the greatest  bad name ever when i read it in the script i went bananas i was like this is 
[00:39:00]  the best thing i've ever read anybody right because colin because it was such over-the-top nonsense and  and he goes and my associate marv gresto here he's got to say the whole name yeah heat bentley  yeah first name and last name colin's uh colin's hilarious he he gives you quite a bit of guff on  twitter occasionally oh yeah that's right yeah there was a whole right blaming you for things  it was such obvious nonsense nobody believed it except the media asked him about it he's like 
[00:39:30]  that's scary that you guys are asked like read by twitter yeah if you did any research and read  10 of colin's twitters you would know that he does nothing serious on on the uh twitter but that's  what's so crazy you know everyone's just trolling for that stuff to find yeah pull a thing out and  one tweet right here's the sound bite  look at that look at that right exactly what happened what happened explain this yeah right yeah 
[00:40:00]  louis ck's in some shit uh because of uh some of his um palin tweets that he made yeah but he had  admittedly made those drunk from a plane i remember when he did that and then he deleted  them and he's like look uh the next morning he was like i might have written some shit last night  i didn't mean any of it i was like trying to apologize plane drunk is a whole different kind  of tweeting and you're bored and now you have the ability to tweet and you might die so you can  say whatever you want yeah it's bad exactly it's all bad are you you're up your back's up against 
[00:40:30]  the wall yeah in that you're almost compelled to tweet offensive horrid things yeah yeah are you in a  place where you like you were because you're you have a great career and you're well known and  like were you worried about saying things like this could be a problem like do you find that you have  to edit yourself a little bit um i guess that's like the only downside of mainstream real fame is  that you kind of have to watch it yeah i mean you yeah you you uh i definitely i mean especially with  the whole social media thing and you'll you know anything that you say in an interview could be carried 
[00:41:00]  anywhere at any time and blah blah blah yeah did that concern you when that happened with colin  or you're more like oh what the fuck i didn't know about it i didn't know about it till someone  brought it up to me so i never i never it's all colin talks about i never would have known  do you see what colin was to you i'm like well you're a colin first yeah  colin ferguson from jail  colin powell yeah was it colin powell i mean are we talking my good buddy circle of friends 
[00:41:30]  former secretary of state but i loved you in that sketch because we'll play it he was right  after the elf movies and they're so successful and you come on with an elf hat playing a lawyer  and colin just brutalizes you for being a fucking wearing an elf hat in a movie  but i was like what a funny dude to come on and do that and then most guys would have a movie of that  big like oh no i'm not gonna no but you just came out with that elf hat and it was really funny  yeah you gotta kind of make fun of everything when you can yeah i i just i just felt that my part in  it was good yeah you care i mean that's the thing that's how he gets brought on stage you know this 
[00:42:00]  next guy yes from from the elf sketch on uh yes yes of course he played marv gresto  i just was watching the today's show this morning and there was a bunch of kids with marv gresto  signs yeah yeah yeah you know what they want mg sometimes you know it's just a  fucking wrist what was going on down the street they uh there was some british boy band was that  what it was all right all right you guys have to get out of here one direction is that their name 
[00:42:30]  why am i pretending like i don't know of course it was one direction see your t-shirt underneath  yeah i was driving up and uh there were just a bunch of uh kids crossing the street yeah  like that easy pickings have you done anything uh dramatic because like uh like or do you want  to do anything because sandler went into like he did i think spanglish and like sometimes for  com and jim carrey has done some stuff that's dramatic sometimes for comics it works sometimes  it doesn't work i did i did i had a thing come out last year um called everything must go uh uh that was 
[00:43:00]  totally dramatic which uh was kind of an indie thing that uh uh a lot of people didn't see but uh that  that was great yeah i loved it yeah it was and you're in the woody allen movie i mean you were  funny yeah that was kind of yeah yeah yeah stranger than fiction's kind of dramatic yeah a little bit  what are you the most tim and eric that's a very dramatic role this movie is pretty dramatic oh  yeah it gets heated yeah i cried mostly i had my own stuff you're sexy yeah you don't know how awry things 
[00:43:30]  went you got plane drunk and went right to the screen of my movie oh my god when you hear like  something if people like because do you read what critics write we always ask you because sometimes  people on twitter yeah will tweet me and i'm like you and i'm like why am i responding to this guy  there's five people following him what do i care for yeah i i um once again laziness but i don't really 
[00:44:00]  look at the the critique so much in a way only because even the someone will send me one like hey  pretty nice review and so and so and i'm like okay great let me click on i'll read it and it  inevitably starts with uh considering most of the things he's done i can't this one actually surprised  like god damn it yeah and i'm like it can't even yeah it can't even be good the whole way right  right right right like uh don't even read the good one yeah yeah yeah oh man this guy's usually a loud  asshole but he showed amazing restraint in this role yeah he's not a total buffoon yeah it's like 
[00:44:30]  praising you by destroying everything you've ever done yeah but you're not you're not phased by it  you're okay with that like you i i would be if i if i if i looked at yeah if i you know went through  uh rotten tomatoes and and checked it all out i'd probably be yeah i wouldn't leave my house probably  but uh we were talking about i just stay away from i just try to say how with twitter and and uh facebook 
[00:45:00]  and whatnot you they have accessibility to people now that they never did in the past yeah we talked  about what it would have been like yeah to tell clark gable he sucked back in those days it was  impossible you could write a fucking letter it would never get to him it was like you know remember that  scene in uh mommy dearest when they're signing the pictures and it's like the help and the maids  are stamping yes the signatures and putting them in envelopes you never now it's like hey huge hollywood 
[00:45:30]  star that's grossed billions you suck yeah you can basically text them with twitter they gave a direct  text to you to write it's like you're texting yeah people you never had access to absolutely do you  tweet are you on twitter i tweeted for four days oh wow yeah you had your full i had my i had it was a  glorious four days but but i got criticism on the tweets that came back it was like it was like that  wasn't funny yeah it's not funny dude this is not what twitter's for because i was like trying to promote 
[00:46:00]  some charity thing i was doing they're like oh yeah that's not what twitter's for man come on  make it count  it's not why we're here it's amazing how some shithead in his basement can actually tell him  that's not what twitter's for when he's trying to promote a charity but it's like you know as  performers we read it most times you don't let it get to you but sometimes like this is something so  irritating about it not that they don't like it but i would love if there was a way and there's no way to  track the percentage of population that actually tweets like it's probably numbers wise the small 
[00:46:30]  handful of people right that are on their thing every day that all right yeah i thought you're  going to say i wish there was a way and i was going to to blow their phone up in their hand  the next time they try to tweet there probably is a way because cia cia probably has that way yeah  you make funny films look easy which is really it's a it's a like you make it look like god that's that's  an easy thing and it's certainly not you have this uh i don't even know how to describe you the 
[00:47:00]  the amazing deadpan yeah i think legendary deadpan would be the way yeah just like how do you  caricature all these you you play an amazing parody of things you have a gift of showing how ridiculous  things are yeah you know i i mean i think uh it's a lot of those movies i've gotten to do with mckay  adam mckay uh you know we we met on at saturday night live and we're just kind of like  you know kindred spirits like we both just thought the same thing was funny and the same approach and 
[00:47:30]  uh and i don't know that's kind of you know put that together and it seems to work what are you  the most proud of right now uh me or will no come on all right probably my aunt lasting two minutes is  not an accomplishment we want to hear some real gold yeah just like proud of yeah yeah my antique gun  collection okay yeah four thousand guns yeah wow that's a lot of look at them every day they're  my children they're my children wow that's great yeah it's really great yeah and uh what else hey 
[00:48:00]  this movie got subtitles i hope so yeah it's if you can't read english this is not the movie for you  yeah going into a subtitle movie sometimes you're like oh god and then two seconds into it you're  just well maybe more than two seconds you're just kind of like oh okay yeah because i want to see  the picture but i want to read the words so i'm like yeah you know what's interesting we've done we've 
[00:48:30]  done a big college screening program with this movie and we wondered if that was going to be the you  know if kids were going to be like i don't want to read reading i can't text while i watch it hasn't  come up once which is good really probably because they are texting they they they read stuff all the  time with the texting so it's just right there in front of them lols no lols because it's spanish that  was the timing different uh because in a comic in a comedy it's like you know yeah but was it 
[00:49:00]  different because people are reading it and laughing did you have to pace it at all differently it didn't  seem i don't know not i mean once you kind of got the meaning of what you were saying it was it  seemed to all flow the same way all right i'll actually see this because uh i don't mean like  i'll actually see it i'll actually i'm gonna throw you a bone well i mean it's it's really radically  different and uh and it's you know we kind of make fun of cliche views of mexico and cliche views of the  u.s and all this stuff that's what's so interesting watching it screened in miami it's like the people 
[00:49:30]  that are sort of being parodied a little bit we're watching it but they were loving it oh  they were spanish-speaking people down there yeah they got a couple got a couple yeah mostly polish  though miami is mostly a polish totally polack town it's called casa de me how do you say this i  mean i know but they don't casa de mi padre oh my god what's that mean that means uh god i have no  idea no that's uh house of my father our casa which is a ridiculous title you see this thing 
[00:50:00]  will be a house because it sounds like house of my father it sounds very yeah very very manly and  epic and huge well they're telling us will has to go um definitely going to support this because the  balls to learn spanish and do it i know right in spanish you are a madman you can't instead of doing  the same thing or something that was similar you just it was a 23 day fever dream believe me  every day it felt like i wrapped an entire movie my brain was like why did i agree to do this but  but it paid off it's it's funny and different you're doing god's work the lord thank you i couldn't i 
[00:50:30]  can't say that about myself but but it's nice to hear yes so is amy though she took the plan b pill  she's doing god's work yesterday she's got life and death right in her womb there and she chose death  i'm in the midst of having an abortion as we speak wow okay well so's our show  this show has been described opian anthony's worst of 2012 12 12 12 12 12 12 12 continues right now  so

[00:54:00]  Worst of 2012  My name is E pestle  In this segment here  Billy Corgan's in studio  Or as O.P. calls him  Billy Corgan  He's at Billy on Twitter  And his name is  Billy Corgan  He's the lead singer  Of Smashing Pumpkins  And we didn't think  He was going to come in  We had some problems  With his scheduling  And what have you  But lo and behold  He came in right before  He had to fly out to Los Angeles  Came in, spent some time, told some good stories.  He was a cool dude.  He's a big wrestling fan, so he's aces in Sam in my book. 
[00:54:30]  We thought he was just going to be one of those melodramatic, sensitive artist people  who wouldn't talk a whole lot.  Complete opposite.  Cool dude.  Smashing Pumpkins, Billy Corgan.  Here, let's listen to it.  This is Opie and Anthony's worst of 2012 so far.  Oh, there he is.  Oh, he's working his way in.  He's walking down the hall like a rock star.  He's walking down the hall like fucking Billy Corgan on the Opie and Anthony show.  Make yourself comfy. 
[00:55:00]  Take a seat.  Guys like, what is this, travel day for you?  Yeah.  Going to LA.  Probably got the same flight as Jimmy.  Jimmy's going out.  How you doing, man?  What is that, vodka?  Vodka.  Oh, man.  Great, because this garbage water they give us.  You got to drink high pH.  Oh, high pH?  9.5 pH.  If your system gets too acidic, it makes you cranky and it sort of opens the way for viruses  and stuff.  Then you know what?  I should drink a lot of this.  It's like your body runs better.  They are figuring out a lot of things to do to water. 
[00:55:30]  Make people buy like their water as opposed to another person's water.  Billy.  You want to be there or there?  Billy, I want to say that you're a genius and the reason is very simple.  You were able to get at Billy on Twitter.  That's amazing to me.  Yeah, yeah.  How did you get at Billy?  That's kind of rough.  You know, there's a lot of Billys out there.  Well, there was an at Billy Corgan.  Right.  Right.  And so I wanted, but the guy who had at Billy Corgan was named Billy Corgan. 
[00:56:00]  And he wouldn't give it to you?  No, so.  What an asshole.  Jesus.  So Twitter has some sort of weird policy.  So they said, okay, they made him at not Billy Corgan.  Right.  Don't get, well, I don't get what that means.  Okay.  And then they exchanged, they said, well, I will give you at Billy, because it's something  about they don't want to give me what he had.  Wait, they changed his Twitter account.  To at not Billy Corgan.  But they wouldn't give you Billy Corgan.  No.  Isn't the name dead now?  No one can use it?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what they did.  So they gave me at Billy, but they actually said, this is cool.  People beg for these. 
[00:56:30]  That's an easy one.  But you're the number one Billy Corgan out there.  I'm sure there's other Billy Corgans.  But what's kind of weird is, is I got to imagine that a fan would go at Billy Corgan and  not find me.  Right.  Yeah.  But then I get everybody else going, you don't deserve at Billy.  Like you're not Cher.  Do they bring up other Billys that are more deserving?  Yeah, like Billy Idol, you know.  Right.  Billy Joel, maybe.  Billy Holiday.  Billy Joel.  Different spelling.  But you got at Billy.  I got at Billy. 
[00:57:00]  That's pretty impressive.  It really is.  Why can't they just give you the name?  Somebody else I know had that happen, and they just kill the name.  They said no one gets it.  Stupid.  It didn't make any...  Why did they turn the guy into at not Billy Corgan?  That just seems so funny.  He's probably like Billy Corgan, Chrysler Plymouth.  Yeah.  He runs that.  Right.  It's like, oh, really?  I mean, there are people in this country named Billy Corgan.  No, I know.  But you're the number.  If he was Billy Corgan, I'd say, okay, well, you got it first.  But it's safe to say you're the biggest Billy Corgan, and when it comes to Twitter and the  social media crap, you should be Billy Corgan. 
[00:57:30]  I don't get it.  Here's a better one.  Facebook kicked me off for not being Billy Corgan.  Wait.  What?  How does that work?  Somebody reported me, right, and said, this is a fake Billy Corgan, and Facebook shut  down my account.  Seized or froze my account, and then sent me some bullshit thing saying, you've got to  prove who you are.  Oh, my God.  And I'm thinking...  So that's why I said...  Screw it. 
[00:58:00]  Screw it.  Here's a video of me.  I know Sean Parker.  I mean, I could call somebody.  Right.  And I thought...  But it was a principle.  In fact, thanks for doing me a favor.  I got the hell off Facebook and said, give me the hell away from this, because this is...  You don't need it.  And then I go and look, and there's like seven fake Billy Corgans pretending they're me.  That are still there?  Or trying to pick up chicks, and they're still running.  They're still running.  Well, their stock isn't doing well, so...  No, no. 
[00:58:30]  Rejoice in that.  No, they had a bump up, though.  I just bought again.  I fucking lost like five grand, and I bought more back, and now it's dropping again.  I keep firing high.  I'll have money back.  I could have bought a bunch of AOL, like 94, 95, and I'm...  And my bandmates bought some, and I'm thinking, ah, you guys are wasting your money.  Oh, yeah.  So I kind of feel that same feeling, like maybe I should jump in now when it's devalued.  You never know.  They're not going anywhere.  I don't know.  That seems to be a consensus.  You know how you know they aren't going anywhere?  Because they're hanging out with the political campaigns.  And the minute you start seeing that kind of backdoor stuff, they ain't going anywhere 
[00:59:00]  anytime soon.  Let's buy Facebook today.  Not a point.  I don't know.  What is AOL worth now, though?  Like, Yahoo, they go way up and then drop.  I think they said a lot of those aren't they?  Do you know what they bought in at?  It's got to be low.  75 bucks a share, maybe, is my memory.  But, I mean, that's so long ago.  Yeah, yeah.  It could have been $7.50.  Who uses AOL at this point?  No, but it was that moment.  No, that was.  You know, where you go, okay.  It was internet training wheels.  Like, everybody had that at first.  It was all you knew. 
[00:59:30]  We all could have bought Apple stock.  Yeah.  We'd be bloody rich.  Oh, man.  It went down to 80 bucks in 2008 when the fucking market shit the bed.  It went down to $80.  Yeah.  That would have been nice.  Now you're touching on 600.  I want to say I'm so glad you're doing our show.  Oh, thank you.  There was a little misunderstanding.  We don't have to get into it, but we're very happy you're here.  Because we're all massive fans.  Oh, thank you.  I'm happy to be here.  And I was sick all week, but I came back in just to say hi to you.  Oh, thank you.  Just to make you sick for your trip. 
[01:00:00]  What do you have in case I get it?  I'm good.  It is sore throat, congestion, crap.  You know, normal shit for the summer.  That wouldn't affect me at all as a professional.  All right.  You stay over there.  I'm hearing nothing but good things about the new CD.  Oh, thank you.  Oceania.  I haven't heard it yet.  I literally got my copy this morning.  It's the first time I put out an album, I think, in 17 years that people like it.  Oh, man.  Right away.  You know what I mean?  Usually I get the seven years later.  Oh, that was actually pretty good.  It grew on me.  It grew on me.  Yeah, it's like, thanks.  Why is that, do you think?  Is it because... 
[01:00:30]  I don't know.  Honestly, I don't...  Believe me, if I knew what people were thinking at this point...  But you don't try to...  Do you try to write hits when you're putting an album together?  You know, back in the day, you knew you had to come up with that MTV-type song.  Right.  But we never, you know, sit...  I mean, if you look at the hit songs we had, it wasn't like we sat there and went with  the formula.  We always try to come up with something fresh that felt really exciting.  I think hits usually means exciting.  Right.  So if we felt, oh, this is pretty exciting.  It was when I tried to maybe be a little more conservative and kind of just do music 
[01:01:00]  I really liked.  That's when it didn't go so well.  So exciting seems to work for me.  But isn't that okay with you?  What's that?  When you were getting more experimental and stuff?  Yeah, it was fine by me.  But it's kind of a weird thing.  It's like...  It's a weird balance?  One day you're nobody, then you're a genius, then you're an idiot.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  And as I've been saying to my friends, now I'm a genius again.  You know what I mean?  It's like, I'm the same guy the whole time.  Right.  I wonder what that is, though, that makes people like one thing that you do and then just 
[01:01:30]  kind of not really pay attention to the other.  If they could quantify it in the music business, they would get rid of people like me.  Because, you know, I'm too much of an X factor.  You know, they don't like that.  They don't know what you're going to...  All these other kids, they know what they're going to say.  Right.  They line them up and they march like robots.  I mean, people like me, I mean, who knows what I'm going to say or do.  And that's too risky for them.  Have you always been like that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Even at the beginning when...  Did you have to do a lot of compromising or did you do it your way? 
[01:02:00]  Really?  No.  Wow.  We were lucky.  But I mean, look, I'll give you an example.  89 were nobody playing, you know, college gig for 50 bucks.  Interviewer.  You know, snobby kind of indie person.  Who are you guys' influences?  Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Cheap Trick.  Guy laughs at me.  Like, don't you realize that people don't like those bands?  I said, we don't fucking care.  That's what we like.  Right.  Oh, that's not cool.  You know what I mean?  So before anything, oh, you guys aren't cool. 
[01:02:30]  This isn't cool.  Don't like this.  Now, of course, everybody loves Ozzy.  Ozzy's great.  You know, back then it was like people would snicker.  It's like, why?  He's great.  Because we grew up in Chicago.  You know, rock radio was like, you love the cars and you like Black Sabbath.  You love Queen.  You know, you love Zeppelin.  It wasn't a big deal.  Right.  Then you get out in the New York-y world and it's like, you're supposed to like this band.  You're not supposed to like this band.  And don't wear this t-shirt.  This just got so old.  Being too cool.  What bands did they expect you to say you liked at the time? 
[01:03:00]  Well, it's like, there's a, well, Sonic Youth would have been number one.  If you said you like Sonic Youth, then that meant, you know.  Oh, these guys are cool.  Yeah.  And we love, I'm saying we love Sonic Youth, but in their mind, it was incompatible with  like Sonic Youth and Led Zeppelin.  Right.  Can't like golf.  But of course, you get behind the scenes and you talk to Thirstmore from Sonic Youth.  What do you grow up listening to as a kid?  Led Zeppelin.  I mean, just like everybody else.  Van Halen.  Like Kurt Cobain.  Van Halen, Cheap Trick.  Absolutely.  Boston, I believe.  Trying to remember some of the other bands.  I mean, Teen Spirit is basically more than a feeling.  That's what a lot of people say. 
[01:03:30]  In fact, I saw Nirvana, I saw Nirvana at their absolute peak, never, never mind, playing  in Japan.  And Kurt started playing more than a feeling.  Oh, man.  And even sang, more than a feeling.  And he kind of laughed.  And then they went into Teen Spirit.  Wow.  Ha, ha, shit.  Yeah.  I mean, he knew.  It's not like he, you know.  Right.  He loved classic rock.  Yeah.  That was his big influences.  Did you guys get treated well by the critics or the douchey?  No.  No, I'm laughing.  I'm laughing because we got sort of a so-so review in Rolling Stone.  The two biggest albums I ever had, Siamese Dream and Melancholy, bad reviews in Rolling 
[01:04:00]  Stone.  So this is like good luck now because I got another bad review in Rolling Stone.  Meanwhile, across the board, everywhere else, great album, best album in 15 years.  People are talking about this album.  Yeah.  I was saying.  And the two you just mentioned were amazing albums.  I'll say it for you.  Thank you.  Unbelievable albums.  Even the deep tracks.  Got bad reviews then.  Those are Rolling Stone.  They really are snobby and they try to be too hip.  And I just think they stink.  I think it's the most overrated magazine ever, is Rolling Stone.  I think they try to hate things. 
[01:04:30]  Try to find something wrong with things instead of just letting it be sometimes.  If it was the critics only, I wouldn't be here.  You know, fans have been amazing.  They're difficult in their own way, but I appreciate the relationship that they want  you to bring the best you got.  Right.  At least with the fan, if you bring the best you got, they'll show up.  Right.  The critics will think of some freaking weird reason why somebody shouldn't listen to you.  But you seem like a guy that wouldn't pay attention to the critics.  Is that true?  I really don't.  But at the same time, it's like, you know, it's a little weird to put out an album that 
[01:05:00]  you know is really good.  You'd see you get poor reviews from particular magazines who have a bone to pick.  God knows why.  And then 15 years later, they're trying to get you to interview about the album that  they panned back in the day because it's become a classic.  You know what I mean?  See, it's like a weird Dostoevsky movie or something.  You know what I mean?  It's like, hey, talk about the thing we didn't like then.  And now we're going to talk about the thing we don't like now.  And it gets sort of surreal. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  I think I have a good sense of what it is.  But I don't know.  I wouldn't be here if I didn't have some ability.  And the critical part of whether or not you match up at any given time with what they think  is I don't think that has anything to do with what people think.  Right, right.  Did you get screwed over on your first album?  Like every band talks about how they had to give away everything?  No.  Well, we signed one of those kind of record deals.  But that was everybody.  Yeah.  It was everybody.  So there was nothing novel about that.  But where we got lucky was they said they didn't think we could sell records on a major 
[01:06:00]  label.  So they put us on.  They had an indie imprint in New York called Caroline, which Hull was on and a few other.  Rob Zombie, White Zombie was on.  So it was a cool label.  And they probably thought we were going to sell about 30,000 records.  We sold 400,000.  So by the time they bumped us up to the major label, they kind of couldn't mess with me.  Oh, man.  I mean, I had the leverage of the moment.  And then every time they would try to mess with me, we would sell more records. 
[01:06:30]  So we kind of outran that Reaper.  Oh, that's pretty good.  Yeah.  You actually had a track record to go in there with instead of...  Yeah.  Because there was an instance where they called me in for a meeting around 92.  Nevermind was huge.  Pearl Jam was huge.  And they said they wanted to reissue our first album.  And kind of try to re-pump it up through the major system.  Bring it up to the major label.  And I said no.  And you should just...  I mean, jaws drop.  Like, who's this kid to say no?  Right.  And I said, it's not the right record.  We made this kind of cool indie record.  It wasn't going to fit in Raider. 
[01:07:00]  What was the name of that?  It was Gish, yeah.  Oh, right, right.  Of course.  Now, were you playing the type of music that you were writing, especially in the 90s?  Were you playing that in the 80s somewhere?  Were you...  Like...  No, we kind of...  Our song kind of evolved, you know, because we were taking kind of UK influences and then  what was happening out of Seattle.  There were bands out of Minneapolis that were playing kind of heavy.  You just kind of pick up things.  That's what I'm saying.  When I heard Grunge out of Seattle, I thought, oh, this is classic rock.  Oh, okay.  You know, these guys had listened to the same stuff that I was listening to, you know? 
[01:07:30]  Have you heard about the new thing where they're putting bands on with hologram?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They did it with Tupac.  But that's just the beginning.  Yeah, it's going to be all...  Every band ever is going to now go on tour in hologram form.  Right.  And whoever owns the rights to that band is going to make now a fortune on touring.  And then you're going to get, like, Tupac with Janis Joplin.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're going to get stuff like you're like, what?  That would never happen.  Yeah.  And imagine a band that's been gone or dead for years being, like, the number one grossing 
[01:08:00]  band on tour that year.  That would just be the oddest thing.  Look at it.  The opportunity for any band to become as big as, say, like the Beatles or the Rolling Stones,  once those bands are gone, gone, gone, and can never come back in any form, right?  Well, I'm sorry.  If you put the Beatles on in hologram form, they're probably going to be one of the top grossing  bands out there.  Right.  And you don't have, there's no temperaments in the back over the deli tray, temper tantrums.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, nobody to deal with.  It's just like, you know, press the switch and the holograms will come back and, you know. 
[01:08:30]  I would go in a second.  I would say the Beatles like that in quality hologram form.  I hate to say it.  I never got to see Nirvana, one of my favorite bands, of the last 20, so many years.  I was actually, somebody asked me the other day if we'd played with Nirvana.  We played with Nirvana one time in Boston, and it was, and not sold out.  Really?  Yeah.  What year was that?  Maybe 91.  Although everyone in Boston that probably says they were there, the place would be overflow.  Yeah.  One of those.  Yeah, I saw them. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  How big was the venue?  About a thousand.  Were you close to Kurt?  You know, it was weird because I'd gone out with Courtney before.  So, you know, we kind of reached a point where there was no weirdness.  You know what I mean?  It was like, we're cool.  Yeah.  You know, like, you know, he needed me to help him.  Because sometimes she'd open for us, so he'd be with her.  And so, you know, we'd make sure he was taken care of.  And we'd have to put extra security because obviously everybody wanted to get to him.  And so, I know he appreciated that there was a respect level there. 
[01:09:30]  It wasn't weird by the end.  Did you ever have to talk about it, or it was just kind of something that worked itself out?  You know, it's one of those weird things like, hey, you know.  Hey, I used to be with your wife.  You know, I don't know.  It's the same for any guy.  You get to hear any of those cassettes he left behind?  No, no.  Where are they?  Because he was always, like, just fiddling and recording stuff on cassettes.  He was so brilliant. 
[01:10:00]  I mean, you know, he doesn't need me to sing his praises, you know.  But I think he was the real deal, you know what I mean?  Absolutely.  And we all knew it.  I mean, you know, if I could explain at the time, it was a bit like the high school quarterback.  You know what I mean?  You look and you go, like, this guy looks great, sings great, amazing songwriter.  It's like, this is kind of unfair, you know.  Right.  And, of course, everybody gravitated to him.  And, you know, the time you're jealous, and, oh, it's not this, and I want to be that, and all that.  And then when the guy's gone, you're like, wow, I wish that guy was still around. 
[01:10:30]  Right.  Because that guy got stuff done, you know.  And now that I look back, you know, we weren't as powerful as a generation without him.  And then all the crap that came and the posers that came afterwards.  I mean, that's why you need guys like that to kind of beat that back down.  I can't imagine what he would say to this world today as far as what's happened with music.  Right.  You know, I'm kind of, I'm more negotiable in that way.  I'm willing to kind of work with things.  I kind of like pop music.  It's all fine and dumb to me.  But a guy like that would have taken it on.  Sure.  I don't know.  Like, you hear Lennon, they released an audio of a Rolling, it might have been a Rolling Stone interview he did when he was 40. 
[01:11:00]  And he goes, you know, I'm 40 now.  I've changed a lot of the way I feel.  And it's like, it really always wasn't the establishment.  Sometimes it was me.  And like, he was really weird.  I'm like how you're putting the inflection on without the accent.  Yeah, because I know, I try to give the message without, you know, because I would have just, instead of focusing on the horrible accent.  Can't you do the liver poodle-ian now?  I really can't.  The liver poodle-ian.  But people can't see, but my hand motion, some would say, would be exactly like Lennon's in a discussion of this sort. 
[01:11:30]  I've grown up.  But he said it was, yeah, I should have just done like a really bad Irish accent.  But he was kind of changing and becoming like a regular 40-year-old.  Even guys like that, I was amazed to hear that interview kind of come around and go, eh.  Changing his ways a little bit.  Yeah.  I mean, it's hard to say, but look, even in his 40s, which unfortunately is when John Lennon died, he was still a great musician.  And even then, even if the message changes through the mouth, the music affects things, you know. 
[01:12:00]  And Generation X, you know, we don't have as much strength as we should have had.  Some people died.  Some people got high and never came back, you know.  So it's been a shame because there were a lot of great voices, you know.  I didn't necessarily like everybody, but I respected that there were a lot of great voices.  Do you have a different look on things?  Like, will you listen to some of the music you wrote early on and go like, ugh?  Or do you look at everything like, hey, that was pretty good?  No, no, there's definitely some cringe, cringe moments.  But you kind of think, well, you know, you knew what you were thinking and you see where it kind of like, could you get caught up in dumb stuff? 
[01:12:30]  You know, like we used to think like we had to be heavier.  And part of that was we were playing in front of these big crowds and you want everybody to jump up and down.  So the amount of energy we spent making certain songs, which aren't great songs, you know, they're good energy.  But now I look back and think I could have done something better if I wasn't so obsessed with trying to get the crowd to jump up and down.  Is it embarrassing to do a music video?  Whenever I see a music video, I'm always amazed.  Like you see a performer singing and it's like they have to go, cut, do it again.  And everybody's watching.  Is that hard to do?  Because I would be horrified to do that. 
[01:13:00]  I always felt a bit weird about it, which I think is why in a lot of our videos, and we started with the record label,  why a lot of our videos don't have that sort of just, you know, here's the band performing in the parking lot stuff.  We tried to figure out ways to not do so much singing.  And let me tell you, it's a little weird.  You know, they roll the tape and you're standing there like singing and then it's like beep.  And then everyone runs around.  The guy's doing this and you're standing there like waiting to rock again.  Oh, man.  The trick is you got to sing like you were singing the song. 
[01:13:30]  You know what I mean?  Like you just got to go with your mouth open.  You sing it.  So at least you're singing it.  You got to see the veins in your neck or it's not happening.  Yeah, there's got to be some kind of emotion coming from you because I think that's sort of what people feel or want to see coming through.  If you're just mouthing, then you're really just acting.  And we haven't even talked about the new record.  That's okay.  You sure?  You've got to promote a little bit.  Just tell us a little bit about the new record. 
[01:14:00]  I think we were releasing one song at a time and it was kind of going okay.  And I'd said I don't want to do albums anymore.  Typical.  And then I thought, you know what?  We just need to make a really great record and get everybody back in point, including us.  And so, you know, the funny thing has been how people are shocked that I made a great record.  Why is that?  I don't get that.  Because the mainstream, whatever, that consciousness assumes that everything an artist does, you want to be that level. 
[01:14:30]  And when you've made a lot of money and you've had a lot of success, I mean, you saw it with Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, some guys I really respect.  There comes a point where it's like not every album has to be the orgasmic, here it is in the starship.  You know what I mean?  Sometimes you just want to make music that you feel strongly about.  And so when I say that, well, you didn't feel strongly about your own work?  He's like, no, we were trying to reach people.  And so we found something that we felt strongly about to reach people.  But some music just needs to be introspective.  Some music just needs to be weird just to kind of figure some other stuff out. 
[01:15:00]  So this is the first album I made in a long time where I was like, okay, I'm going to focus on that level.  And it's like people are like, oh, I climbed out of some grave or something.  Meanwhile, I've been here the whole time.  I've been putting out albums every couple of years.  So it feels good.  I'm happy.  It's nice to see people happy around us for a change.  And it's been a while.  And we're just kind of going with that for the moment.  Yeah.  You're looking forward to touring?  It'll be interesting because we're going to play the whole album in sequence.  And we hired Sean Evans, who's been working with Roger Waters on the wall, live staging. 
[01:15:30]  Like I just saw the wall in Chicago at Wrigley Field, 420 foot wall, you know, on the outfield.  It was insane.  I mean, 42 projectors, you know, it's like only Roger Waters could pull out.  You know, the flying pig and the whole thing.  So, I mean, we wish we were that lucky.  But we're going to do something where, you know, at least you can experience the album played live.  And then there'll be sort of a set of visuals to go with it.  So it'll be more of an experiential thing.  Kind of like back in the day.  I mean, back in the 70s day.  Yeah, yeah.  Right. 
[01:16:00]  What's your favorite Sabbath record?  Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath.  Sabbath, I think is their, that's where, that's the difference between just Sabbath being a great rock and roll band and Sabbath being an incredible artistic, creative band.  That record's just so dark and crazy and weird and, you know what I mean?  And I always, actually, I always love volume four.  I don't know if you know that.  It's kind of got a really weird sound.  And I remember talking to Tony, I only once in the studio, and I said, what was going on with volume four?  What a weird sound.  He's like, yeah.  See, now there's the accent.  It always goes up at the end. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  And he said, he said, like, something along the lines, like, like, because it was L, they were working in L.A. in some house.  And because it was L.A., the drug dealer would just stop by every day.  He probably knew it was like, you know, it's a good place to, yeah.  He's like, you know, it's the drug dealer.  And he's like, yeah, it's really crazy.  You know, it's like, but it's like, you know, as a fan, you're like, oh, this record's so dark and weird.  I wonder what they were, you know, you know, this kid, like, upside down, cross.  And he's like, oh, yeah, the drug dealer was coming by every day. 
[01:17:00]  The drug dealer came by, and that's the only reason.  Every Sabbath record, every song on the record couldn't go on any other album.  I think that was, like, there's nothing on Master Reality that belongs on Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath, or from Sabotage to, there's just nothing that should go on another record.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And actually, I just got some sort of weird, from Japan, like, perfect, you know, I think you call it SACD.  It's, like, super high mastered of mob rules.  Because I love sad with Dio, too.  I mean, unbelievable. 
[01:17:30]  I mean, Dio.  And I got to meet Dio once and talk to him for 45 minutes.  That was incredible.  Yeah, he came on the show once.  He's just a fucking great guy.  He was fantastic.  He really was.  And that voice of his was just amazing.  And then you go, wait, he's 70.  Yeah.  That last tour, he was...  No.  He was 70.  Yeah.  He was born, like, in the early 40s.  Jesus Christ.  So when he was on that last set of touring, he was doing his Sabbath, he was in his 70s.  Holy shit.  Man.  And you're, like, wow.  I came around my head around that.  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  I'm still hitting every note.  Yeah, he had one of those friggin' rock and roll voices.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Billy, what a great comment.  I like this a lot.  Oh, thank you.  I think we've got to get you out of here, because you've got to go to L.A.  Doesn't that sound wrong?  What?  We've got to get you out of here, so you go to L.A.  That just sounds so wrong.  I'm sorry.  It's like you guys are condemning me.  We've got a guitar in the corner and everything.  Go to L.A.  We wanted you to play, but I know you're a busy man, and we appreciate you coming in.  Thank you.  Thanks for having me.  And good luck with the—you're not going to need the luck, but Oceania?  We do need the luck, honestly.  You think? 
[01:18:30]  It's a really weird atmosphere, you know?  Right.  I mean, look, if you're competing against people you respect, grudgingly, it's one thing,  but when you're competing against a bunch of robots, I mean, it's robot land out there.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's shocking to me, because alternative culture was always like, well, there's all  that, and then there's us.  Right.  And then when the Stepford Wives took over alternative music, it got—you know, it's weird.  It's like, you're looking around, like, what happened to that kind of vibe?  Right.  Everything.  You just don't fit in our—you know, we'll play all your old music, but you just don't 
[01:19:00]  fit in our demographic now.  You're not heavy enough.  You're not this enough, you know?  And then you listen to these bands, and it's like, who are these people?  Right.  You don't even know what they think.  You don't know what they feel.  You don't know what they look like.  I mean, it's just sort of like this blur of people.  Right.  And they just keep running them out there with, like, you know, heavy names, like, you  know, Thor Hammer and Hammer Thor and—you know what I mean?  It's like, okay, just keep running them out here, you know?  You've been around.  I mean, Rob's like, okay, I'm still here.  You've been around long enough to see the whole thing change. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  A few times.  It's bastardized, yeah.  I get the feeling, though, like Rush just put out a new album, right?  People are praising that album.  Okay.  Biggest first week in Canada they've ever had.  Really?  Okay.  So that tells you something.  People are kind of figuring it out.  You know what?  Like, I'd rather have Rush around, you know what I mean?  Now, they made a great album.  Than Thor Hammer.  But hey, I'd rather have Rush around than all these other people.  I think people are starting to figure that out.  You know, because don't forget, you know, Hope I Die Before I Get Old. 
[01:20:00]  There was a point where you weren't supposed to be old and rock.  Right.  But hey, I'll go see The Who any day.  I'll take The Who at 80 over just about anybody.  Right.  Because they're going to give you something.  I mean, remember when they played at the 2001 9-11 memorial?  Mm-hmm.  And people were like, because that's what you need in those moments.  You need real music.  Right.  And that's the weird thing for me, because economy's bad.  A lot of people are struggling.  They need real music right now.  Right.  And people like us aren't perfect.  It's not.  You know?  Like, I did an interview with Geddy Lee yesterday, and the guy said, oh, you know, it was kind 
[01:20:30]  of like a co-interview.  And the guy said, you know, you both have unique voices, you know?  And Geddy Lee goes, nobody wants our voices.  Because we both have weird voices, right?  Right, right.  But that's part of, you know, Rush being weird and different, and Geddy's weird voice, and  my weird voice.  That's kind of what people like, because you're real.  Yeah, and you know it when you hear it.  You know who it is.  I call it unique, not weird.  Okay, great.  But the point is, is that maybe we're starting to figure out that the unique quality is the 
[01:21:00]  thing that really makes the difference.  Right.  Because you can't manufacture people like me, you know what I mean?  And maybe you don't want to.  But, I mean, okay, how many Eddie Vedder clones have they marched out?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  There's been a few over the years.  And I'm not a big Vedder fan, but at least he's Eddie Vedder.  You know what I mean?  You know who he is.  You know what he's about.  Okay, well, okay, great.  These other people, I don't know what they think.  I don't even, they might be from Mars for all time.  They don't know what they're thinking.  Exactly. 
[01:21:30]  We're never going to hear an auto-tuned Billy Corgan?  No, actually, I refuse to use auto-tune in the studio.  No shit.  Good.  Believe me, there's times where it's like, it would be so much easier, and I got to get  home, and I just go back out and sing it again.  Right.  Because I just don't want to be that guy.  A little flat on that last line there.  Fuck, yeah.  Can't you run through a machine?  No.  You know, you brought up Rush so quickly.  Why aren't they in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  Why isn't Kiss in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  Right.  What is that all about, you think?  It's got to be some kind of politics. 
[01:22:00]  You just made Jimmy very happy, by the way.  Yeah, I'm not driving me nuts, the fucking bands.  I mean, I watched the Sabbath's induction, and they finally got in after all those years.  But Kiss not getting in and Rush, it's just, it's sickening.  What does Rush have to do at this point?  It's stupid.  I think, I've been talking, because I've been doing the press rounds here in New York.  Yeah.  I think it's time where the, look, the music business is messed up, but it's time to start  bringing in those bands that people love.  You know what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  It's not a critics thing anymore. 
[01:22:30]  Like, we're talking about the critics.  Right.  A lot of people love my band.  A lot of people don't like my band, don't like me.  But rock and roll, if you don't have that passion, I mean, what the fuck are we doing?  You know what I mean?  Right.  If you just turn it into just baking cookies and stuff like they try, okay, Kiss, still  getting it done.  Still.  But what?  Rolling Stone can't give them a cover?  Why?  Because Gene might say something, might make fun of Rolling Stone.  That's the way it used to be, right?  Sure.  Like, bring it on. 
[01:23:00]  That was rock and roll.  Like wrestling, you know?  That's why I got a wrestling company.  It's like, bring it on.  What happened to the bring it on?  What happened to the bring it on part of rock and roll?  Yeah, yeah.  They're telling us you got to go because you got a flight.  They're whispering, you got to play.  Do I?  Yeah.  My jet's waiting on.  You have to go to L.A.  We'd have you sit in for the rest of the show.  Yeah, I'm a lot of this conversation.  Thanks.  Thanks for having me.  Billy, so cool to have you.  Thanks, man.  Absolutely.  Really cool.  Anytime, please.  I'm glad you guys reached out to me because I didn't know.  I was like, what the fuck is this about?  I was bummed out.  I saw that.  I was like, I got no problem.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  That would have been hilarious if he blocked you. 
[01:23:30]  Fuck this Opie's negativity.  Ad Billy has blocked you.  And it was almost negative.  I was like, I was like, frustrated.  I'm like, come on.  We've been fans of you forever.  I believe you said fucking lame, bro.  I did say fucking lame, bro.  Fucking lame, bro.  I have to be me still.  Wow.  I was like, what is that about?  You know, it goes back to something we did 10 years ago that had nothing to do with you  that we don't even know.  That's how weird this shit gets sometimes.  Some publicist thing.  Yeah, you don't have to get into it.  I'm just letting you know.  I march into radio stations, right? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  Where they won't play whatever.  And I just try to go meet the guy or girl and say, what's the deal?  And they'll go, do you remember back in 94 when you blanky blank?  And I'm like, really?  That's what this problem is about?  You played the competition's radio station when we were trying to do a promotion.  Oh, shut up.  And you're like, but I'm still here.  Like, that makes sense if I'm not here, but I'm still here.  Right.  I mean, you know, the politics in these businesses.  I'm just glad we worked it out. 
[01:24:30]  Look at the political discourse.  I mean, who doesn't get to talk?  Who gets to talk?  Who knows who?  Who's somebody's boy?  Like, I'm always amazed.  Like, if you watch, like, CNN or something, and they're going at it, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  And they get to the end of the segment, so they're like, ha-ha-ha.  And, you know, they go back in the green room, oh, Bob, how's your golfing?  Yep.  Well, it's just fake wrestling.  We've been on those shows.  Yes.  So we've seen it in person.  In the green room, you're absolutely right.  Everyone's all pals.  You're working on that book?  Yeah, it's going well. 
[01:25:00]  What publishing?  Oh, yeah, I've worked with them.  Yeah, they're just their best of friends.  They're all drunks.  Oh, my God.  Everybody on any news day.  I've gone out with the Fox News people.  I've never met a bunch of drunks like the Fox News people.  Boy, can they drink.  I believe in psychological terms.  That's called unconscious guilt.  Is it?  Well, I'm right there with them, though, at the bar, so.  Jesus.  All right, well, my private jet is where you just got to go.  To L.A.  And it's at Billy on Twitter, which I think is the most amazing thing about you, that you were able to get Billy on Twitter. 
[01:25:30]  Well, you've got to get at, not Opie Radio.  I tried for Opie.  There's another guy out there that might have that one.  Whatever.  All right.  Billy Corrigan, it was a pleasure.  Thank you.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2012.  12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12.  Continues right now.  Yes, Worst of 2012.  My name is E-Rock.  And in this segment here, we're going to feature yet another one of Jim's friends slash characters slash voices in his head.  We've done Ted. 
[01:26:00]  We've done Chip.  So that leaves only one person, Edgar.  No, Uncle Paul.  Yes, we're going to compile a bunch of stuff for Uncle Paul.  He's had a busy year this year dealing with the Sandusky trial, the Penn State scandal, and a few other things.  Uncle Paul has been very vocal.  Here it is, the best of Uncle Paul for the Worst of Opie and Anthony in the year 2012.  This is Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2012.  Do we get to talk to the Honey Boo Boo as well or just to June?  Just June.  Just Mama.  What, do you want to talk to a fucking seven-year-old, however old she is? 
[01:26:30]  Do you want a real answer to that?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, no, we're done with Uncle Paul.  A lot to talk about.  So what do you say?  Come here, I'm going to talk to you.  Oh, sure.  Sure you do.  I'm a friend.  I'm your age.  Age is just a number.  Yeah.  Don't mean nothing.  Sure.  Well.  Hop up on this laparoon.  Do you watch Honey Boo Boo, Uncle Paul?  Yeah, I got it on the DVR.  Yeah.  Sure I do. 
[01:27:00]  Love it.  Why?  Give the kid a little.  Ah, that kid's great.  Yeah, you pop that on there.  You get yourself some warm earl in a pan.  What?  I heat some earl on the stove.  Some earl, yeah.  Yeah, and I put it over some Crisco earl.  And then what?  Rub it all over myself.  Tug it while I'm watching.  Oh, Jesus.  Is that how you watch Honey Boo Boo?  Yeah, I got my pants around my eye.  One time, I had the hot earl pan on the sofa, and it caught fire. 
[01:27:30]  It was so hot.  Oh, wow.  That warm earl, you scoop your hand in there.  Yeah, a bunch of warm Crisco.  Yeah.  Some lard?  Yeah.  And I put a half a cuke in my bottom.  Jesus.  You got to cut it in half. 
[01:28:00]  You can't put the whole cuke in there.  Sometimes you'll lose.  You got to cut it in half.  And in one half, you put the thing that removed the champagne cork, because that acts like  a blocker.  So it don't go on corkscrew.  It keeps the cuke from disappearing.  You put the cuke in a little earl, and you stick that in your bottom, and you watch Honey Boo Boo. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, for cuke.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you dip your hand in the earl there.  You get Peter pumping.  That's what Honey has after Uncle Paul visits her, a boo-boo.  Sure, I said that to her.  Where's your boo-boo?  Let me give it a kiss.  Oh, boy.  This is ONH Worst of 2012.  The father who killed a man trying to sexually assault his daughter. 
[01:29:00]  Oh, yeah.  Good for that fucking father, man.  Four-year-old daughter.  Right.  There was a guest in his house, I guess.  Now, the story says trying to molest.  You're saying it was...  Oh, well, from what I read, it seemed like he was, you know, molesting.  Completely in.  Well, whatever.  Completely in.  Completely in on the molestation, if you know what I mean.  So the father killed the guy.  Good for him.  God, I hope he doesn't do jail time.  I do.  Texas father has not been arrested.  Has not been arrested and is unlikely to face charges. 
[01:29:30]  And they're saying, I don't think it was his intent for the man to die.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he might have punched him and he falls down and hits his head.  No, I think when a father sees his four-year-old being molested, the intent is to kill the guy every time.  I'm sure in the police report it says,  Well, obviously, he didn't mean to kill him.  And, uh...  The man's grandfather also said his son was sorry and the killing was an accident.  There you go.  The killing wasn't an accident.  Off the hook.  Good for the father. 
[01:30:00]  Good for him.  He should go to jail.  Oh, Jesus, Uncle Paul.  That's unnecessary.  He should have talked it over.  What did she say?  What was her part in it?  You don't just go beating people up.  They may have been in a relationship like Romeo and Juliet.  Romeo and Juliet.  Maybe they were going to elope or something.  You don't go beating people up for being in love. 
[01:30:30]  That father needs to go to jail and be punished.  So you're saying the father deserves to be punished now.  Yeah, he interfered with that relationship.  What if it wasn't a relationship?  Sure it was.  They was getting to know each other.  This makes it much better.  Yeah.  Oh, how are you, my darling?  She was four.  Hello.  Uncle Paul, she was four.  Sure, that's what I'm saying.  She's ready to travel. 
[01:31:00]  Travel?  You're going to elope like Romeo and Juliet.  Of course.  It's a beauty for love story.  And then the father comes in and starts yelling.  Oh, what are you doing, Paul?  Get that out of there between the crib bars.  She's going.  She's going.  She's going.  No, no, no, no, no.  She's.  Get that out of the crib bars. 
[01:31:30]  No.  She's going at it.  She's going at it like, like a gerbil going after a little water bottle.  Oh, come on.  Jesus.  Wow.  Yeah, everybody's got to yell at you.  No reason for that.  Why don't you just talk things over?  Hey, what are you doing?  Is everybody okay with this? 
[01:32:00]  Sure.  Sure.  Tell the father to get out of here.  Go in there and watch the TV.  We're making love.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Uncle Paul, that is despicable.  It's not despicable.  And then my friend Jerry's in trouble.  Oh, Jerry Sandusky?  Sure.  We used to get together and play the old frickle frackle.  Frickle frackle.  Yeah, that's where you put, like, all the soapy suds on your penis. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  And you move your hips like a hula hoop, and the water's splashing the boy in the face,  and he's getting frickle frackled.  Never heard of frickle frackle.  Sure, and the suds are flying off his cheek, and everybody's laughing.  Like the Sandusky soap fights that we heard about from victim number four?  Yeah, we'd have all, four was a bummer.  Five and six were fun.  We'd do the old frickle frackle.  Why do you think they're calling them victims if they were willing participants? 
[01:33:00]  His name is Victor, isn't it?  No, it's Victor.  Oh, I didn't hear that good.  You thought all their names were Victor?  Yeah, Victor four, Victor five.  You put all the soapy suds on your peenie, and then you slap the cheek while the water's splashing,  and it looks like slow motion, and the dog's shaking the soap off him.  You're giving the old frickle frackle.  Goddamn tattletales.  He's in Dutch, huh? 
[01:33:30]  Mm.  Quite a jam.  Oh, that father gets in big trouble for beating up that lady's boyfriend.  Lady.  She's four years old.  People are saying you've got to mention it was in Texas.  Of course.  Yeah, Texas.  They certainly have their own law in Texas.  Yeah, they've worked over the years.  They don't treat you nice down there.  They don't fuck around.  Yeah.  Bullshit.  They kept thinking I was riding a file bike or something.  They thought I kept riding in a way. 
[01:34:00]  I don't know.  They was yelling at me.  A file bike?  Yeah, who's Megan Slaw?  Megan Slaw.  I don't know who she is.  A file bike.  Oh, my God.  They kept saying this Slaw girl, Megan Slaw.  I don't know her.  I think it's Megan Slaw.  No, Megan Slaw.  They were yelling at me.  I'm like, I never met the lady.  Yeah.  I don't know who she is. 
[01:34:30]  Lady.  And they were saying pedophile.  They weren't saying pedophile.  To peddle your file bike.  Oh, of course.  Get that out of the crib, Paul.  She's slipping and slapping at it with her little hands.  Quit poking that between the crib bars. 
[01:35:00]  God damn.  That guy should get in big trouble interfering with a married couple like that.  They weren't married.  Sure they were.  Four-year-olds can't get married.  Yeah, they can.  His old balls hanging over the crib like a mobile.  Sure.  Just because you don't know how to make a smile and giggle, and I do.  When they hang over there, when the sack hangs over, and they go, ha, ha, ha, and they slap 
[01:35:30]  at it like it's a toy and such.  It's such.  Yeah, and they just slap at it with both hands, and everybody laughs.  You are fucking horrible.  Well, Texas sure has a way of...  Yes, they do.  ...delivering their own justice.  I like the cop as it goes in there.  Well, case closed.  I love it.  Fuck you.  We should have more of that.  John in North Carolina.  John.  Hey, boys.  Hey, John. 
[01:36:00]  What do you see?  Well, I'm going to hunt out this video.  Back in the 80s, a news crew captured a guy on a phone, and his son's molester was extradited  into an airport, and he just turned right around, and...  Oh, yeah.  We've seen that one.  I think most people have seen this video, but it's a classic.  What?  The father was on a pay phone?  Make him believe he was just kind of a guy in the...  Yeah.  He just happened to be a guy in the area, but he was the father.  Wearing a little hat.  Yeah.  Of the kid that was molested, and they were bringing the molester through, and he fucking took 
[01:36:30]  care of business.  Whatever happened to that guy?  We always had.  Spun around, one shot.  He was a justifiable homicide.  I believe he was acquitted.  He was acquitted.  Yeah.  And he shouldn't have been.  My friend was a karate teacher.  You'd get in there, and everybody would take off our clothes, and he'd go, hey-ya!  Hey-ya!  And you'd roll around doing judo-judo.  How do you know all these people?  They're friends of mine.  Yeah.  He was my karate friend.  Hey-ya! 
[01:37:00]  Hey-ya!  Yeah, let me show you the crane.  Oh, oh, yeah.  Oh, boy, not the crane.  Hey, sure.  Yeah, sensei.  Give sensei Paul a kiss.  That's not right.  Protect the guy.  Hey-ya!  This is O&H Worst of 2012.  I learned that if you're going to molest a baby, you need to make sure that your penis  fits through the crib bars.  That's right.  Uncle Paul.  And what was just so disturbing about Uncle Paul today is that he did the voice of the  person yelling at him, and you could hear someone saying, Paul, get your dick out between 
[01:37:30]  the crib bars.  So gross.  I'm so happy that having a child hasn't diminished my love for Uncle Paul.  Yeah.  You still enjoy it?  It's hysterical.  I was commenting in the back that it's like, you know, no one's going to sit here and realistically  think that molesting a baby is a good time.  No, it's a bad thing.  But if you have the kind of humor where you listen to a joke like that and you can't  laugh hysterically, I just don't want you in my life.  I just don't need to know you. 
[01:38:00]  I also loved that the characters started morphing into his real life when Jim saw Coco Jones,  who I guess is like a Disney Channel star, who's the daughter of a football player named  Mike Jones.  And she was with her father.  Jim thought they must be boyfriend-girlfriend.  And he was talking about how beautiful she was and how much he wanted to kiss her.  We looked her up on Wikipedia.  She's 14 years old.  She is 14 years old.  Jim apologized immediately for his discretions. 
[01:38:30]  Rich in Buffalo.  Yeah, you guys just touched on something that I always think about.  Anybody's Rich in Buffalo.  I can laugh hysterically at Uncle Paul.  And then I stop and think about it and go, wait a minute.  This is like awful, you know.  You know what a fucking asshole this guy is.  I know.  Well, but what's funny, I think what makes it acceptable is that Jim will, if we're talking  about a child molestation story, Jim will morph in and out. 
[01:39:00]  So one moment, you'll have Norton, who's appalled by this person who molested a kid.  And then the next moment, he's morphed into Uncle Paul, who's relating to this guy.  And then the next moment, he's back to Norton being appalled.  So it's like, okay, I got the guy who's appalled.  So I don't, it's okay to laugh at this, at this character.  And plus he takes it out to such an extreme level, I think.  And that's where, well, yeah, I think, I think when Uncle Paul turned the corner is when  he started mentioning his penis and dropping all subtleties from his act. 
[01:39:30]  It used to be all just implied molestation.  Now it's just like, yeah, what I do is I have the little baby touch my penis.  Yeah, I remember like a couple of years ago, it was like, oh, sure.  I used to take care of you when you were a kid.  Now it's like, oh, you used to put your little lips on my balls.  Yeah, yeah, and it's like, what?  You can't say that.  Uncle Paul Hargis is on the phone.  I don't like the fact you're misrepresenting me.  I'm not misrepresenting you, Uncle Paul. 
[01:40:00]  The little Trump bottom Danny over there saying I said this and that.  I didn't say none of those things.  You've gone on the air and you specifically mentioned baby hands on your penis.  There's a nun.  I know.  There's a nun.  This is the best part about this.  There's a nun who's looking into the studio right now.  There's three old women and one of them is a nun and we're talking about Uncle Paul molesting babies.  Yeah, she's probably a big cattle tale.  Meanwhile, she's spanking everybody with a ruler.  Nobody's checking to see if she's damping her. 
[01:40:30]  You know what?  Well, either way, it's a terrible thing to do.  Why don't you shut up?  No, why don't you shut up?  You make a lot of people uncomfortable.  You're a little potty man and your father used to call me over and say Sam's misbehaving.  Can you straighten him out?  My father...  So you're...  Get right in there in your little Hulkamaniac outfit.  No, Uncle Paul.  My father never punished me through molestation.  Yeah, he did.  He'd say, hey, Paul, why don't you give Sam the world's greatest treat? 
[01:41:00]  And then you'd be rolling around on your belly for three days.  Sam, don't...  Sam, you obviously don't remember when Paul took you on that wrestling outing when you went to see the big show.  Yeah, we'd only have one chair and Sam would have to bounce in my lap.  Up, down, up, down.  Yay, the Hulkamaniac.  Yay.  The Hulkamaniac.  You come home and reenact some of the wrestling matches that you've seen?  Yeah, here comes King Kong Brady.  Yay.  Hey, everybody's wrestling.  I don't like you slandering me.  I'll sue you if you keep saying I had baby hands all over my penis. 
[01:41:30]  I didn't say nothing about little soft, cuddly baby hands on my penis, cupping it like experts.  I heard something about...  Oh, cupping it like experts.  First of all, you called a four-year-old a lady today.  I didn't say nothing about none of them little raffle-shaking hands expertly moving back and forth over my genitals.  I didn't say that. 
[01:42:00]  You're putting words in my mouth.  Didn't I hear something about your penis going through crib bars?  I was trying to hang something on the main boat, and I had my shorts, and it fell through.  It ain't my fault that kid saw it.  Oh, look, a candy factory or whatever it was she thought such.  He said the kid was going for it like a hamster to a water bottle.  Yeah.  Paul.  I didn't know what to do.  I gotta go.  I'm in the car.  Goodbye, Uncle Paul.  This is only age-worst of 2012.  How is time travel supposed to work? 
[01:42:30]  Well, based on...  How are you supposed to go back in time?  Based on the episode, there were so many different variations of this time travel.  But how are you supposed to go back in time?  It's got something to do with traveling at the speed of light or closer to the speed of light.  So then what happens?  You could see George Washington living?  Yes.  That sounds stupid.  Yes.  There's particle accelerators.  And they spin particles faster than the speed of light, which then opens up a tunnel, which  you can then go through and end up in various times through history. 
[01:43:00]  Well, here's what happened.  There was a picture, a photograph that they were teasing this whole episode of a guy,  and they never showed the picture until the end, of this guy pointing at the picture  going, this is me at the Gettysburg Address.  It's the blurriest, nothing picture of him as a child because they sent back schoolchildren  back in time to deliver something.  How marvelous.  To the first Uncle Paul back in 1790. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, sure.  Uncle Stanvish.  Stanvish.  Hey, Uncle Stanvish.  What's that stuff dripping on my pilgrim shoes?  Hey.  Miles Standish?  No, it's Stanvish.  Hi, I'm a little injured boy.  How are you?  Oh, no.  Come here.  You got some anthrax in your underpants.  More atrocities for the redskins.  Let me slide down your underpants and get the anthrax out of there. 
[01:44:00]  It fell in the crack.  Time traveling, Paul.  That would not be good.  Hey, look it.  Close your eyes.  I got a peace pipe for you.  Oh, boy.  Kiss the spitting peace pipe.  Oh, Jesus.  The spitting peace pipe.  Yay.  Have the spitting peace pipe give you a little peace in your backside.  Yay.  Oh, that's terrible.  Shouldn't send Uncle Paul back through time to molest children.  Yeah, put the pilgrim hat over your face so you can't see nothing.  Look at my big pilgrim socks. 
[01:44:30]  Yay.  This gentleman.  Breaks havoc on the boys, huh?  Yeah.  This gentleman said he went back in time as a child.  They had a bunch of school-age children.  So you watched these episodes?  Time travelers.  Oh, fuck yeah.  That were time travelers.  And one of them was this guy who went back to the Gettysburg Address, and he goes, you  could notice in my picture here, I'm wearing shoes that are much too big, which I don't  know what that was supposed to mean. 
[01:45:00]  You know what it was?  His shoes got blood on them, so I gave him mine to wear for the picture.  Bloody shoes.  File trading was so hard back then, because there was no electricity.  I'd say, hey, let's trade some pictures.  I'll meet ye by the pub.  Meet ye.  And we would show up with drawings.  That's wonderful.  Look, this is Timothy without his underpants.  I drew this on a piece of paper.  Show me ye pictures. 
[01:45:30]  They, um...  Let's have some warm ale, so we can breathe it into the boy's face.  They, um, got, uh, this picture.  And the guy apparently has these giant shoes, big, big shoes on.  And then he's holding a cylinder, he said, which just looked like his shirt.  No, that wasn't his shirt.  It was a cylinder.  A fleshy cylinder.  Holding it in his mouth.  He brought a fleshlight back with him. 
[01:46:00]  This is O&H Worst of 2012.  Rush.  Headlong fight.  Oh, boy.  Flight.  It's no red bar cheddar.  It's no leaning in the limelight.  Him and his uncle dreaming by the fireside.  Sure.  You took my red car out, did you?  Get in here and dream by the fireside.  Big gleaming alloy air car was heading towards you two lanes wide.  That's right, yeah. 
[01:46:30]  White, I told you, the bridge is singular.  Take the bridge and leave him stranded by the riverside.  I didn't know Jimmy knew that much about, uh, red bar cheddar.  Then get back here.  Dream with me by the fireside.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Your white-haired uncle.  Yeah.  Get over here.  Uncle Paul.  Come to my farm.  He's rubbing his dick.  He's rubbing his dick.  Sure I am.  He's a character.  Jimmy rubs his dick.  No, it's not Jimmy.  Little Getty comes to the farm. 
[01:47:00]  And I showed him out in the barn.  I said, look at the red bar cheddar.  Here you go.  We're going to make sure your bottom's clean before you sit in the seat.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't it just?  Oh, my God.  I got to get in there and clean your bottom out.  Good point.  Before you sit in the...  You know what?  I don't want to put you in the driver's seat in the red bar cheddar with a dirty bottom. 
[01:47:30]  The older my kid gets, the more I hate Uncle Paul.  Why?  Just say it.  It smells like, uh, it smells like, uh, uh, uh, uh.  Yeah.  It smells like well-weathered, well-weathered leather, hot metal in the oil.  Scented country air.  And you got the, the, uh, uh, uh, something with chrome, uh, sunlight on the chrome. 
[01:48:00]  And there's a blur in the landscape.  Right.  And every one of your nerves is aware.  Get all those nerves aware.  Put you in the seat of the red bar cheddar.  Yeah.  Gotta clean their bottom.  Gotta clean their bottoms.  Cause you don't want it, you don't want it to smell like dirty bottom and well-weathered  leather, hot metal in oil.  You just want it to smell like leather, metal in oil.  Hot metal in Earl.  And Earl. 
[01:48:30]  Well-weathered leather.  Hot metal in Earl.  Scented country air.  Get back here and dream with me.  By the fire sight.  Of course.  I gotta fire lit.  Gotta check your bottom now.  He's rubbing his dick.  I know he is.  Get in here.  I know.  Get in here.  He's rubbing his pants.  I'm gonna punish you for taking a red bar cheddar out of the barn.  Of course.  I was just sitting you down, but you took it for a ride.  And that big, that big, uh, alloy air car almost hit you. 
[01:49:00]  Alloy air car.  Yeah.  Shot towards you two lanes wide.  Right.  What'd I tell ya?  Yeah.  Fresh boy.  Because that's the way that new cars are in the old red bar cheddar.  Yeah.  It was gleaming.  Right.  Let me get in here.  Make sure you don't got no sweat down there to get all over the well-weathered leather.  I want it to smell like hot metal in Earl.  Uncle Paul, you're despicable.  Get back here.  Dream with me by the fire sight.  Of course. 
[01:49:30]  I'll give you a special milk.  Put you under the afghan.  And you could, you could dream about sitting in a well-weathered leather seat.  And all of a sudden you sat on something.  Felt like a big baseball bat.  Are those the words to the song?  Put it on.  Sure they are.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well-weathered leather.  Hot metal in Earl.  Scented country air.  I told this boy all that.  Oh, boy.  Oh, this boy.  Look at this.  The intro's 20 years long.  Doesn't this just plump you up pretty good?  Because you think the kid's coming to the farm again. 
[01:50:00]  Right, but...  I didn't have white hair until I saw all those charges against me.  Yeah.  Turned my hair white immediately.  And then my nephew said, what's wrong with your hair, Uncle Pearl?  I said nothing.  Uncle Pearl.  I said, I'm your white-haired uncle.  Oh, right.  Oh, God.  Good timing, too.  Yeah.  Nine minutes into the bit.  Nine minutes.  I've said well-weathered leather 400 times. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, oh.  My country place.  Uncle Pearl.  Yeah.  Oh.  It's a secret place.  No one knows about it.  It used to be a farm.  Goddamn motor lodge.  Came along.  Everybody got nosy.  Or loft.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I said, take the train to come see me.  Look at my white hair.  I'm waiting for you.  Yeah. 
[01:51:00]  Uncle was waiting.  That's why I laughed.  Dug-a-dug.  Dug.  Dug-a-dug.  Dug-a-dug.  Dug-a-dug.  Yeah.  And I'll hold that little hips and bounce them.  Dug-a-dug-dug.  Dug-a-dug.  And then you go.  Dug-a-dug-a-dug-a-dug.  Give him a little bouncy ride.  Hop that turbine freight, but don't get your hands all greasy.  Dug-a-dug-a-dug-a-dug-a-dug-a-dug.  Get here quick.  Yeah. 
[01:51:30]  He's getting all excited.  That's the medicine I gave him.  Sure.  I'm in the barn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All machine.  It's all for you.  This is like a song about the future, man.  Now I like to sit him down and tell him my dreams.  We get under the top.  While my aunt takes her sleeping medicine.  My wife.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You better vanish time, bad boy. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  I have enough rush.  Turn it on.  That wasn't the roar.  That was me breathing into your neck.  Yeah.  I'll commit a crime, too.  Right in your bottom.  How great is that?  Yeah.  His hair gets all musk with the wind.  That turns me on.  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  It's all mussy.  Yeah.  And I give him a little Viagra, and the blood rushes through him.  He thinks it's adrenaline.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Gets his nose all stuffy.  Little Peter stands up with no hairs on it.  Oh, Jesus Christ their Uncle Paul.  This is the only age worst of 2012. 
[01:53:00]  Are you still a Mets fan, Danny?  I mean, call it what you will.  I mean.  Horrible year, obviously.  Define fan.  Like, what does that mean anymore?  Like, when your team just sucks for so long?  Like, I'm not going to switch to the Yankees.  I'm not going to be like, hey, let's get Yankees tickets.  I will still go to a Mets game, but I don't know if I can even call myself a fan.  Like, what am I a fan of anymore?  This should never be.  I was a sports fan my whole life.  Loyalty to teams.  It's stupid.  It's fucking nonsense.  Because none of these cocksuckers would step over my fucking body. 
[01:53:30]  So it's like, fuck them.  Fuck all of them.  You're right.  No, I mean, and I'm not like a fanatic like that.  Because I don't, honestly, I just don't really give a fuck.  But when you're that close to a team, like, how do you, in New York is, you know, you kind  of have to pick a side because there's two different New York teams.  Like, it's one or the other.  It's not like we could all agree, oh, it's the New York New Yorkers and everybody's happy.  It's, you know, you got, there's a line in the sand.  So how do you pick?  We used to look out your window and flushing at the stadium together.  Remember me and you? 
[01:54:00]  Now that you're bringing it up, now I remember.  Club, I'd be like, come here, let me pick you up.  I'll take you there someday.  And you'd push your little rump back while I was holding it with your little face up  against the screen.  Didn't you get me one of those mini bats at the stadium?  Yeah, I brought one with me and I'd say, hey, it's the mini bat.  Look at that.  It's got like a little bit of, got like a little bit of juicy candy on the tip.  Get it on, spank your bottom with the mini bat.  You said that was chocolate ice cream.  No, it was just a little bit of clear candy. 
[01:54:30]  Yay.  Clear candy.  Have some sugary candy.  Clear candy.  And you said that little skin shell thing, you said that was just from the Cracker Jack popcorn.  No, I would always rub that between your upper lip and your gums.  You remember I'd do that?  I'd rub the little bat between your upper lip and your gums.  I don't like going to the ball game anymore.  I wouldn't either.  I would Uncle Paul.  Yeah, I'd slide your PJs down and tickle your feet.  I don't care if I ever come back.  Yeah.  Remember I would touch your bottom and we would sing the Meet the Mets song. 
[01:55:00]  Jesus.  Slide my finger down back by your thighs.  By my dugout.  Yeah, you'd be so confused.  Where are the Yankees at these days?  Why am I going along with the Mets?  Because you remember.  Because you remember.  Your little feety part of your pajamas would make that shuka shuka shuka sound while you  was shook.  Did I get a jersey after the game?  No.  He was a very bad boy.  I gave you some Jesus juice. 
[01:55:30]  You'd fall asleep.  I'll tell you money you was bad.  When is baseball over?  I don't know.  You know.  End of the month.  You know, Mr. October and that shit.  Yeah, I know.  We got to still do the October thing.  October it.  Yankees hanging in there?  Yeah, you know.  Yankees are a game ahead of the surprising and fantastic Baltimore Orioles.  Yeah.  Travis Murray.  Remember I took you to Camden Yards when you was a baby?  Yeah, I do.  Sure.  Sure. 
[01:56:00]  I drove by.  You sat in my lap.  We looked at them building new Camden Yards.  That's weird.  Like, Uncle Paul, will you take me?  I'm like, sure.  Kiss the magic eel.  Remember that little travy?  I was tens.  Yeah.  You're an old boy.  Well, it only opened 20 years ago.  I dropped your mother off at the temple.  And then me and you went downtown.  I showed you Camden Yards. 
[01:56:30]  I said, you know, Babe Ruth is from Baltimore.  And you was like, really?  No wonder we're both gay.  That explains it.  Dr. Gay, of course.  I give him that nickname.  Oh, you did.  Sure.  We were playing doctors.  He says, go ahead, push back, doc.  Push back.  It's always about the pushback, isn't it?  Sure it is. 
[01:57:00]  That way the police can't say you did nothing wrong.  You should have seen, Your Honor.  He was pushing his little hips back.  He was gobbling it up.  It's like a little Pac-Man, hiney.  Eating my seeds.  Waka, waka, waka, waka, waka, waka.  He was pushing back.  Going after all the little colored monsters.  Sure. 
[01:57:30]  Sure.  I've never seen one eat one like that before.  Just gobbled it up.  This is Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2012.  Worst of 2012, Opie and Anthony Show.  Production just said that, but I said it again.  My name is E-Rock.  In this segment right now, a, I guess you could call him an acting legend.  Royalty, if you will, in the Hollywood community.  Donald Sutherland is in studio.  You may know him from countless projects for some of you older people. 
[01:58:00]  MASH, Animal House.  For some of you younger people, Hunger Games.  And for Travis, he's Kiefer Sutherland's dad.  So that's all that matters to him.  Here it is.  Donald Sutherland.  Opie and Anthony's Worst of 2012.  I'll handle this.  He's got his lunge.  Oh, yeah.  He's rolling past with it.  He's gone.  What?  He just flipped Jimmy the bird.  He just went by us and gave us the finger. 
[01:58:30]  That's funny.  He just flipped the bird.  He went around the corner and gave us the middle finger.  Oh, shit.  What the hell was that about?  What is he doing?  He's in Al-Q right now.  What's that?  He walked into the Al-Q studio.  I guess he was supposed to do us first.  Oh, he's coming back.  But he walked by.  I don't think he knows where he's going.  Well, bring him in.  No, they're trying to figure it out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's people trying to figure it out.  He's his own guy.  Oh, that's hilarious. 
[01:59:00]  He just gave us the finger.  He's just like, whatever.  That's great.  He's got his Donald Sutherland luggage on.  He's taking off his trench coat.  Okay.  He's got to go to the restroom.  What happened?  He's got to go to the restroom.  He is flowing.  Look at those locks of gray hair.  Long, white hair.  Yeah, this is white.  Hello.  Hi, how are you?  What kind of microphones are these?  Hello, sir.  I don't know.  What are they?  What kind of microphones?  Probably cheap ones for this company.  Sure.  Very cheap.  This company isn't known for...  Can I have a U87? 
[01:59:30]  Exactly.  See?  He's a guy that knows his stuff.  Why are you carrying your own luggage?  You're making everyone nervous.  You're rolling your own luggage, sir.  I am?  Yes.  The mics do work better when you pull them in front of you.  You smell really good.  Does he smell good?  Oh, he smells great.  Yeah.  What does he smell like, Jimmy?  Just really good cologne.  Like, very clean.  Yeah.  You smell good.  Like success.  I'm sitting beside someone who can't tell the difference between perfume and flatulence.  I see them as one and the same. 
[02:00:00]  You smell great.  I really appreciate that you guys have water and tea and all that stuff.  It's nice.  And why wouldn't you?  Do you want something?  I have no idea why I don't, but just no one else.  Well, you do have water.  That is your water.  That's fair.  Do you want something else, sir?  I'd love a cup of black tea.  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  We'll get some black tea.  We'll get some black tea.  Wow.  You do smell good.  Yeah.  Dang.  It's permeating the room.  Yes.  I like it.  Thank God.  Because this place stinks.  It's success and it's a successful movie.  That's what it is.  Everybody came out, you know, the Twitter feeds all said it was an A, an A+, which is 
[02:00:30]  great, you know, because an exit poll nowadays can kill a movie.  And this one, it's just, but it's, people keep saying, you know, I don't want to go see  it.  It's a movie for kids.  It's not a movie for kids.  It's a movie for adults.  It's living up to the hype, too.  Like a lot of times, like you're saying, if you pre-hype a movie, there's nowhere to  go but down from there.  But what an opening weekend.  This one's got everywhere to go up.  Yeah.  You know, this is a movie for the 99%.  It has a chance. 
[02:01:00]  When I read the script, I didn't know anything about the books.  When I read the script, I said, my God, this could allow young people to feel that they  can determine their destiny, you know, and it's great.  Do you feel when a movie's this successful that, would you rather have a successful movie  monetarily or something that you really are happy with and proud of doing?  I'm happy with this and I'm proud of doing it.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  It's like, it's amazing.  You've got both as far as this is concerned. 
[02:01:30]  And if it can, if it can in some way organize young people, you know, it's been a pretty  dormant generation.  I just, I read the other day the Port Huron statement that the SDS produced in 1962, 50 years  ago.  It was wonderful.  And we have nothing like that today.  The SDS?  SDS.  I know what that means, but they don't.  What is it?  Students for a democratic society.  Oh, SDS.  I got the wrong letters.  You said SDS. 
[02:02:00]  No, DS stands for Donald Sutherland.  Who booked me into this show?  Exactly.  Look at her.  Can we, can we, were you very active growing up as far as social?  I was active growing up.  Yeah, I, I, I, I, you know, I grew kind of a foot a year.  Oh, see?  That's because he is tall and he's very tall.  No, I'm active politically.  No, I was, that was, no.  I'm from Nova Scotia.  Yeah?  You're of Nova Scotia, huh? 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  Oh, Canadian.  Where men are men and sheep are afraid of us.  Are you a Canadian?  No, but I have friends that are Canadians.  No, so we're not fellow Canadians.  Did you hate the way you tried to bond with you on that and then you realized he's from  Long Island?  Our neighbors to the north.  Yeah, I'm just from Long Island.  That was creepy.  Are you from Canada?  Really?  You too?  No, Long Island.  Well, one of their glaciers ran over Long Island.  If I could try to put the connection there somewhere.  You know, Hunger Games, third best opening weekend of all time.  Should be mentioned while Donald Sutherland's in the studio.  That includes franchises. 
[02:03:00]  That includes Harry Potter 2 and one other one.  I can't remember which one it is.  It's the, it's the best opening weekend.  That was a franchise or a sequel.  No, the sequel, yeah.  Right, right.  Gotcha.  This is not yet a franchise until the second one comes out.  $155 million so far.  That's pretty good.  Hope you got a piece of that.  You got a piece of the action?  Well.  Okay, really a downer, right?  No.  I may, when John Landis, he had been a gopher on Kelly's Heroes. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, he was?  Do you want me to tell it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't want to spoil it.  No, I know the Animal House story.  That's what I mean.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  He was a gopher on Kelly's Heroes.  Oh, wow.  I didn't know that.  And MASH came out when I was over in Yugoslavia and he said, okay, I'm going to be a great  director.  I said, well, if you're going to be a director, I'll be in every film.  So I was in Kentucky Fried Movie and all that kind of thing, just playing a waiter or whatever.  And I was shooting Invasion of the Body Snatchers and he said, come over to up to Eugene, Oregon  and do a day on this, playing a professor who smokes dope. 
[02:04:00]  And I said, okay.  He said, Universal wants to offer you 2% of the profit.  I said, Universal?  2%?  No.  Oh, no.  I said, they need to pay me my daily rate.  So they did.  2% of Animal House, huh?  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Well, you know.  Forget about the Neumann U87.  Do you know, what would 2% roughly have translated into? 
[02:04:30]  Do you have any estimate?  Have you just tried to block it?  I just want to know.  If the figure 2 million comes into your mind.  Yeah, yeah.  I would think it would probably be a lot of money.  Were you surprised in 80 when ordinary people beat Raging Bull for Best Picture or did you  kind of feel like it was going to?  Well, I don't think about those kind of things, to be truthful.  I mean, Marty's movie was wonderful.  Bobby was fantastic in it.  It just appeals to a different audience.  That year, Jack Lemmon won Best Actor. 
[02:05:00]  But De Niro won for Raging Bull.  Well, then that wasn't the same year because the same year, oh, maybe, I don't know.  Jack won, maybe it was.  Redford won Director for Ordinary People, and Ordinary People won Best Picture, and I  think De Niro won Best Actor.  Oh, did he?  Okay.  Why are you arguing with Donald Silverman?  Oh, I'm not.  I'm helping.  My goodness.  No, no, no, he's helping me.  I'm 76 years old.  I need whatever I can do.  And I want to thank you very much for the tea.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:05:30]  I'm still making it.  We told him to get it.  I told him to have water and tea ready, and they just don't do it.  We have the water, but no tea.  I just keep trying to pass the water to him.  Here comes the tea right now.  Oh, is that his tea?  I bet it's in a plastic cup.  I think it's in him.  Is that his tea?  Yes.  A real tea.  No, it's in a plastic cup.  Can you believe it?  It's in a Starbucks.  It should be in the bone cup.  You guys are trying to poison me.  Yeah.  Put it in the bone cup, Barbara.  Do you prefer a glass to drink your tea out of a glass?  Because I know Bill Cosby likes to drink out of a glass and not...  Anything.  Anything other than plastic or paper.  Oh, boy. 
[02:06:00]  We are screwing up by the numbers here today.  Oh, no.  I'm just being a complaining old...  No.  It's a fantastic movie.  Yes.  Jennifer Lawrence.  I said somewhere that she should be called Jennifer Lawrence Olivier.  She's just a great actor.  Yeah.  And Gary is a brilliant writer.  Those scenes in the Rose Garden in the movie, did you see the movie?  I have not seen the movie yet.  We couldn't get tickets.  It was sold out all weekend.  We could not get tickets.  It's the big city, New York.  Kind of hard to get tickets. 
[02:06:30]  We're going to see it.  Swear.  He's going to kill us.  I've seen every Donald Sutherland movie.  You've seen almost every one.  You haven't seen this.  I haven't seen Little Murders.  Little Murders.  Little Murders.  Little Murders.  What a great film.  The odds are not good.  It was a very, very funny movie.  But the look he's given us, I got to tell you, we live in Manhattan.  We could not go see this movie.  And they won't give us a screener copy, obviously.  It was sold out the entire weekend.  They won't give us copies, which some films do, but films of this size never give out screeners. 
[02:07:00]  No.  So we couldn't see it ahead of time.  They don't give out screeners because there's so much problem with...  Pirating hard.  All I'm saying is we want to see the movie before you got here.  What are these video cameras doing?  Because otherwise I would have dressed.  Terrific.  You look great.  I don't know.  Seriously.  Do you look great?  I think it's...  What do they do with that?  We just videotape every interview.  Yeah?  Uh-oh.  Turn those cameras off.  What are you doing with it?  No, no, no.  I don't know.  I just needed to know.  I don't know.  Okay.  All right.  I like that.  He's looking at the film.  Great pleasure being on you. 
[02:07:30]  Do you like...  Miller Merz was 71.  No one had talked about it.  Like, you know, I mean, back then they did.  But it's such a fucking great underrated comedy.  It's a great movie.  Alan.  Gosh, he was funny.  Who?  Elliot Gould?  No, no, no.  Elliot, you know, Alan, when he directed it.  Oh, I don't know who directed it.  Vincent Gardinia's in it.  And I think Donald just plays, like, this really weird...  I play a minister.  Hippie minister.  It's not weird.  Everybody's...  No, he's very straight.  Well, it was...  But it was bizarre for that movie, maybe. 
[02:08:00]  It's maybe...  Because it kind of seemed like it was the juxtaposition of him to Vincent Gardinia.  It was supposed to be kind of like a shocking presence.  Little Murders was a Jules Feiffer script.  Okay.  Yeah.  It was funny.  Well, now I've got to see that.  I know.  Now I've got to see Hunger Games.  Carol, I've never heard that name on a man before.  You were just fantastic.  That and JFK are my two favorite Sutherland monologue moments.  Oh, yeah, that is it.  Oh, right, right.  Yeah.  By the way, a lot of people trying to help you out, Donald.  They know how much money you would have made from monologues.  Oh, no. 
[02:08:30]  JFK...  That's no help.  JFK took three months to prepare.  For that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, it was whatever it was, 20 minutes, 20-minute monologue.  And you can't memorize it.  I mean, you could memorize it and just say the words.  But to make it real, you have to have it so profoundly absorbed that you can answer a telephone  in the middle and then go right back to what you're saying because it's in your head like  it's really in your head.  Is that what you did?  Did you research everything and just until you knew it backwards and forwards and then 
[02:09:00]  just kind of speak it out?  But I mean, I had done a lot of the research earlier because I had produced a film called  Executive Action, which was about that.  And Fletcher Prouty was somebody that I admired and believed in.  And yeah.  Anyway.  Well, he was the guy.  Wasn't it based...  Your character actually was based on two people.  It was based on Fletcher and somebody else...  Go see The Hunger Games.  It was based on Fletcher and somebody else or somebody else. 
[02:09:30]  No, it was Fletcher.  Fletcher Prouty was there.  Oh.  Yeah.  You know.  Fletcher and Oliver Stone.  Oliver Stone has a piece of everything.  People actually are compelled with you and that movie and stuff.  So I think it does.  When JFK...  Yeah.  People are interested in, you know, your other movies. 
[02:10:00]  Because he told something and when he told it, you listened to him.  Yeah.  I was just there for one day.  I came and went.  Well, it's one of those parts that kind of stand out.  It's kind of the same as this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here you come.  You go.  But not quite leaving the brilliance on that film.  So I'm failing here.  No.  No.  No.  It's all right.  I can take exception.  We're failing you.  No.  No.  It's a...  Please.  It's wonderful.  In that monologue, but that is what...  That kind of summed up everything everybody felt about that whole assassination and that 
[02:10:30]  monologue.  The rest of the movie was great, even though I think Oswald did it.  But I think that that monologue was fucking summed up what everybody thought about.  It's not whether or not Oswald did it.  It's whether what was behind Oswald doing it.  Hmm.  That's kind of just the window dressing.  Keep the people guessing.  It's like a parlor game.  You're doing lines at Oswald's.  I can't help it.  It's Oswald's.  Way too late, guys.  Way too late.  Hunger Games, though.  See that.  Really.  Of course.  We're all going to see it.  That's what we're talking about.  I can't wait to see this one. 
[02:11:00]  Do you pay attention to the criticism or the positive reviews that a film like this  gets?  Or do you not care what people say either way?  Or does it bother you and make you feel great?  Are you going to say something bad?  No.  No, no, no.  I know it's okay.  No, no, no.  No, it's okay.  No, it's okay.  Because you were saying the Twitter stuff was really positive.  Well, but the Twitter stuff is only, that's just exit polls, you know?  That's people coming out of the movie saying, I loved it.  And that's wonderful.  That means something.  Because nowadays in this modern society, people coming out of a movie saying, this one sucks. 
[02:11:30]  It just kills it.  Suddenly, the rest of the weekend goes in the toilet.  And this one was never, ever projected to be 155.  Max, it was thought maybe 138.  Wow.  It just went through the roof.  That's got to make you happy.  Did you read the book to prepare?  You said you read the script, but then did you read the book to learn more about your character?  Or did you say no?  No, I didn't want to know anything.  Of course I read it.  I just told him, I spent three months preparing for this monologue. 
[02:12:00]  For 20 minutes.  I thought you meant for JFK.  I thought you meant for JFK.  He did.  You meant for JFK, didn't you?  No, he did, yeah.  No, I meant for Hunger Games.  Oh, I thought you meant for JFK.  You said you spent three months preparing for that monologue to absorb everything.  Yeah, I know.  But you were just asking me if I read the book about Hunger Games.  Or did you maybe want to make character decisions that you didn't want to know what the book said  because you couldn't bring that in?  Or did you want to read?  I didn't know.  That's why I asked.  You guys really are very brave.  Why are we brave?  I'm going to sit with him all this time. 
[02:12:30]  No, you know, this is, how many, 30 million people have read this book?  Wow.  This is a movie in the imaginations of 30 million people.  And 30 million people are going to be happy with the movie that Gary Ross has made.  But to be a part of their imagination, obviously, I had to read the book that their imaginations movie was based on.  I was just afraid if I said, did you enjoy the book, you would yell at me and go, I didn't read the book.  Why would I read the book?  I'm playing the part.  See, you screwed up, Jimmy. 
[02:13:00]  I know, I really, there's no good answer here.  That's what we're all finding out.  It's no winning.  How do they upset one of my favorite people?  I don't think so.  No, no, I'm in love with you.  I didn't know how to bring it up.  It wouldn't be an opportunity.  But it's, you come out of the movie feeling so happy.  It's just if young people recognize that they've been a dormant generation.  And if they can just get it together to, you know, this is a movie for the 99%. 
[02:13:30]  They should stand up and do something.  Did you think Occupy was a good thing?  Like, at least it got people moving?  Oh, my God, of course it was a good thing.  It was a wonderful thing.  It still is a wonderful thing, you know.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, when you have people...  I like it, Ant said really.  Oh, I'm over here going, really?  Yeah, Ant said really.  No, no, no.  When you have people standing up saying, we don't care that you're rich, we just care that  you're trying to buy our government. 
[02:14:00]  Those are people that you can believe in.  Yeah, but then they do care that you're rich.  No, they don't.  No, no.  Yeah, they kind of do.  Well, they care if you're rich, if you're...  If you have somebody like, what's his name, Stanley?  Stephen Schwartzman, you know, who says that Obama, when he tries to close that corporate  tax loophole, when he says that, when he makes it akin, when he draws a parallel between  that and the Nazis invading Poland, yeah, sure, take his $4.7 billion, because he doesn't 
[02:14:30]  belong...  Oh, wait.  You know, but when you have General Electric, who makes $4 billion in profit and doesn't pay  any tax and gets a rebate, yeah, sure, come on, you know.  Oliver Wendell Holmes said taxes are what you pay for a civilized society.  Yeah, but when do you think it kind of stops a little bit and gets a little more...  You know, they can't keep taking, keep taking.  My God, it gets a little...  But it's the people that aren't paying, see?  That's what I mean.  That's what I mean. 
[02:15:00]  They keep taking, and that's what I mean.  The young people have to realize that it's their identity to take hold of and their destiny  to realize and stop the taking, you know?  I mean the taxes they keep taking from me.  See, I was on the other end of it.  I'm talking about...  No, no.  I don't like being taxed a lot.  Well, then you don't like a civilized society.  He doesn't.  He's very uncivilized.  You can see him eat with his hands.  It's disgusting.  I can't believe they got me on this show.  Yeah. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, I know.  He's part of the 1%.  You actually have listeners.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, can you believe it?  Boy, do we.  I know.  It really, it is astounding.  I was listening to NPR.  I was...  I'm sorry.  Wow.  I was listening to NPR.  I came out of my house and I...  Would you have insomnia?  I have insomnia.  I was driving on the PCH heading towards the McClure Tunnel, and she, the young woman,  was interviewing Willie Nelson on the occasion of his 75th anniversary, and it was, I just  heard the tail end of it. 
[02:16:00]  It was a wonderful interview.  And she was fine.  She was very young.  And as I got into the tunnel, she said, is there anything...  It was the end of the interview.  Is there anything about being 75 that has surprised you?  And he said, yes.  And you could hear in her voice how excited she was because she thought, I've got a scoop.  This is it.  She said, and what was that?  And he said, I never thought that I would outlive my penis. 
[02:16:30]  No.  You could tell.  You would have lost heavy, heavy traffic on the 10 going east, right?  Yeah.  In Los Angeles.  One out of every six cars went out of control.  That's a great line, man.  That's, uh...  That's Willie, though, yeah.  Yeah, we've had Willie, huh?  He is, uh...  He likes his pot.  He'll say whatever the hell he wants.  He loves his pot.  I'm 43, and I'm already in a Cialis binge.  I don't know how anybody makes it to 75 and keeps a solid rod.  We're going to talk about that stuff.  I require medication.  Jesus, this is the most depressing show. 
[02:17:00]  No!  That should be...  That's uplifting.  That was uplifting.  Yeah, it was uplifting.  No, if it were uplifting, terrific.  Then he wouldn't need the Cialis.  Yeah, literally.  Yeah.  So, uh...  Hunger Games.  Have you ever refused the role because you didn't like the tone of it, or that you thought  the movie itself was giving the wrong message?  He doesn't like your questions.  He doesn't stop, does he?  He doesn't stop.  Do you like his questions?  John Borman came and lived beside me for two weeks.  I love John Borman.  His twins came and played with my twins. 
[02:17:30]  He wanted me to do a movie called Deliverance.  And I said, no, I do not...  I said, can you believe it?  No, I do not want to do violent films.  So he went and he cast John Voight and made Deliverance.  Sam Peckinpah said, please do Straw Dogs.  I said, no, I do not want to do films that are violent.  And then I went to play a fascist in Novocento, who killed a kid by swinging him around his  head.  Oh, Jesus. 
[02:18:00]  And the part they offered you in Straw Dogs, I guess, was Hoffman's part?  Or was it one of the...  Yeah.  No, it was her part, but I said...  Yeah.  No, it was the part that Dustin eventually played.  But yeah, I had to...  Alan Alda, have you ever talked about...  I love...  Yes, he's one of my favorite people.  Just one of the great, great gentlemen.  And I was...  I didn't...  I'd never met him.  I was standing beside him in a lineup to meet the Queen Mother at a film, but a royal film 
[02:18:30]  performance in London.  And I saw that it was him, but we hadn't actually met.  And he...  His elbow hit my side, and I leaned in, because you couldn't look sideways, because you had  to face the Prince Philip, actually, and the Queen Mum.  And he leaned over towards me, and he said, I want to thank you for my life.  Wow.  And it was the most elegant, wonderful thing.  Just...  Wow, that's amazing. 
[02:19:00]  Beautiful, eh?  Really beautiful.  That's all right, man.  Do you like the show?  Is it weird to watch someone else play a role that you've played?  I have to be truthful, I've never seen it.  But then I haven't seen...  Wait, you've never...  ...either.  I mean, I saw half of it.  Wow.  But I haven't seen the whole thing.  You never watched the show?  I didn't watch the show, and I've only seen half the movie.  Half the movie?  Why do you guys do that?  Do you know how wrong it is that you just said to me and Donald Sutherland, why do you guys  do that?  Like, we're both doing the same thing.  No, I mean, we've heard it from other actors. 
[02:19:30]  Why won't you watch some of your own work?  I don't get that.  Because it's not my own work.  I mean, I give somebody else my work, and they take it and...  But I mean your own performance, I guess.  But they take my performance and change it around.  It's not me.  I don't give a shit.  But my character, you know, early on, I'd never seen Clute, for example, really protests  because they've taken my arm and put it on my ear and that kind of stuff, you know?  And that bothers you?  Obviously.  Oh, God.  It bothers my character.  Was that bad? 
[02:20:00]  No, no, it bothers my character.  I'm panicking.  It's that bad.  The look he gives you.  The look he gives you.  You'll be very happy that Dick Cheney has a new heart.  You'll be very happy to know that he has a heart.  I wouldn't wish ill of anybody.  So, yeah, if, you know, he gets a new heart.  He might have been a Cheney guy.  How does the donor's family feel?  Well, I guess that depends on their political affiliation,  but I'm sure they would rather have whoever the donor was in their life 
[02:20:30]  than Dick Cheney having a new heart.  He probably jumped the line in front of a few people, too.  No, he didn't.  It took 20 months.  Yeah, he was on the waiting list for a while.  I mean, to get a heart plant transplant when you're 71.  Yeah, that's going to take over.  That'll take a while.  That means he knows some people.  You think?  Oh, come on.  I don't know.  Remember Mickey Mantle getting his liver?  That was a travesty.  That was a travesty. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  He drank through that second liver in two weeks.  Oh, did he?  I saw a guy with a heart transplant in Canada  sitting in the window of his fish market smoking cigarettes.  He was great.  Wow, really?  You know, and this was in Canada, and so we pay for it.  Yeah, yeah.  And I said, listen, mother, you know,  I don't give a shit what you do with yourself,  but that's my heart's damage.  You know, I paid for that.  You sure repoed it right there on him.  And not watching yourself,  have you seen, like, Ordinary People or your performance at JFK? 
[02:21:30]  Ordinary People, my God.  And Bob insisted I go see it.  Halfway through it, I got down in between the seats  and crawled out of the seat.  Oh, my God.  Why?  Why?  You're so good in that.  You're great in that.  You're so good in that.  You should see The Hunger Games because I'm really good in that.  I will see that.  We're going to see The Hunger Games.  Well, it's a testament to how great this is.  I love my character in The Hunger Games.  Gary Ross did just such a wonderful job of creating this  because he wrote scenes in The Rose Garden  that Suzanne Collins is totally enthusiastic about 
[02:22:00]  but that weren't in the book.  Oh, they added some things in that weren't in the book.  Yeah, to define for people  the nature of this oligarchy of privilege  that this allegory is about.  Have you seen the movie?  Have I seen the movie?  I've seen the movie twice.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Now you'll...  No.  Kiefer, when I was not going to see Six...  God, that tea is really... 
[02:22:30]  I'm allergic to it.  It just burped.  When Six Degrees of Separation opened,  Kiefer went in to see it  and I stayed outside with Fred Skepsy, the director,  and went to have some...  And he came out and he said,  Dad, you really have to go see this one.  And so I went to see it.  And I was okay, you know?  I mean, it was like having vertigo or something,  you know?  You get over it.  Really?  And I get over it.  So I go see everything now.  Oh, okay.  I forgot you were in that.  With Stockard Channing, I think.  Didn't you play your way?  That was great. 
[02:23:00]  Do you get embarrassed watching yourself?  Like, if I act, I get embarrassed watching myself.  And I probably...  So does the audience.  I should get embarrassed.  It's incredible that he leaves himself open like that.  I know.  Believe me.  Wow.  And it's very rare of these guys  to hit me below the belt.  You should never be embarrassed about your work.  Oh, shit.  Donald, who do you play in Hunger Games?  We should get the basics out there  for the people that haven't seen the film.  I play Coriolanus Snow,  who is the president of Pan Am. 
[02:23:30]  That seems like...  He's 76 years old.  He's beautiful.  No, he's great.  He really is great.  He's staring it over you.  I'm hanging in there, though, man.  I'm staring right back at him.  I'm trying.  Were you nervous when you had to...  No, don't do it.  Don't do it.  When I came in here,  I was absolutely terrible.  I thought, gosh, look at these three wits.  I was going to say going through the audition process, 
[02:24:00]  but I couldn't say anything.  Oh, my God.  Don't look at him.  When is the last time you auditioned for something?  Like, how many years has it been  since you've had to do that?  Two.  No.  Oh, no.  Hey, you know something?  After Ordinary People,  I couldn't get an audition.  I couldn't get a meeting for one year.  Why?  I couldn't get a job.  I couldn't get a job.  Why?  There are other people you have to ask,  because I thought, I'm ready.  No, I couldn't get a job.  Weird, eh?  Do you honestly...  I was joking.  I figured you hadn't got an audition since MASH, 
[02:24:30]  but you'll still have to occasionally  ask you to read for something?  Oh, sure, yeah.  You know, and they'll say things like,  oh, he's wrong for this.  He doesn't do comedy.  I say, I can tell you a joke.  But you did MASH.  Precisely.  Yeah.  I did Kelly Sears.  Did you ever see Kelly Sears?  I love Kelly Sears.  Come on, it's great.  You did Clint Eastwood?  No.  It was wonderful.  It's a great cast.  Yeah.  And I resent the fact that those two,  when I said I hadn't seen it,  both went over the top with how much 
[02:25:00]  you loved it.  To further humiliate the masculine.  Well, we're trying to pile on now, Jimmy.  When I was a kid,  I went to the movie theater  in Central Islip,  and all day on a Saturday,  sat there with my friend,  and we just watched it  over and over again.  It's a long movie.  What are you saying?  Tickets for and selling?  Do you know how bad it makes you feel  when they say,  when I was a kid?  That's why he said it.  He's just trying to hurt you.  No.  Stick it to you.  Believe me.  That was him trying to hurt you.  It's all about taxation.  It's back to that.  Yes.  Don't tax me this much.  I'm barely holding on.  So what was the first job 
[02:25:30]  you got after Ordinary People?  Max Dugan Returns.  Oh, man.  And they offered it to you,  or they wanted you to read for it?  No, it was a supporting role.  And no, they didn't ask me  to read for it.  Though, Herb Ross,  he's dead now,  was the director.  And it's a film  where my son plays baseball.  And he doesn't have anything to do.  He just had one line.  There's just one little scene.  And Kiefer was there. 
[02:26:00]  He would have been 16, I guess.  I said to Herb,  can my son just do this?  He's not acted.  He's played an extra.  He was interested in it.  And Herb Ross said,  I have to audition him.  And he took him into his trailer  for two hours  and came back out  and said,  no.  No, this is,  he can't do it.  And he got some guy,  I don't know.  Anyway, with all respect.  Wow, why,  why did he say no?  Because it happened.  Kie couldn't have been that bad.  No, he wasn't bad at all.  He was terrific. 
[02:26:30]  You know.  God, you'd think  he would do your favor.  You're Donald Sutherland,  for God's sake.  Yeah, really.  But when you look back  and the guy's like,  that's what I thought.  Who says he's not funny?  He's quick.  It's Donald Sutherland's quick.  But what a shitty decision that is.  Kiefer's in one of the biggest shows  in the last season.  For 50 years.  And he's a wonderful actor.  He's a great actor.  And a fantastic man.  Yeah.  We did Letterman together.  And we're doing a movie.  We're going to do a movie.  Redemption.  Oh, you are.  We did.  Yeah.  You knew it?  No.  I did not know that.  I think you said,  did I really do Letterman with him?  I said yes. 
[02:27:00]  Leno.  No, Letterman.  Letterman.  Yeah.  Yeah, you were on Leno with Kiefer.  Yes.  Have you guys ever worked together?  What?  What?  No, I said,  he's trying to brag  is what he's trying to do.  Yeah, he is trying to brag to you.  He's trying to brag.  And Donald, I think he said,  had never won an Oscar.  And I was shocked by that.  I was shocked.  Well, I couldn't win an Oscar.  Of course you could.  No, I've never been nominated.  Oh, that helps.  No.  Maybe that was what he said. 
[02:27:30]  That was a shock.  Wait.  Anyway, anyway.  Do you remember Johnny Carson?  Sure.  Milton.  Do you know who Ramsey Clark is?  Yes.  Was?  He was the attorney general  for Lyndon Johnson.  And he was on Johnny Carson.  Milton Burrell had been there  originally.  You know,  Milton Burrell did the opening  and he was sitting down  beside Ed McMahon  and Ramsey Clark  and Johnny Carson  where this would have been  in the early,  very early 70s  were talking about  how to get out of Vietnam, 
[02:28:00]  how to end the Vietnam War.  And,  but they were just  having a conversation,  you know,  and not coming up,  I must say,  with any solution.  And Milton Burrell  was waving his hand like that,  like to the radio listeners,  I'm waving my hand.  And Johnny finally said,  yes, Milton.  And Milton said,  I can tell you  how to end the war.  And Ramsey Clark  turned around  and looked at him  and Johnny said,  how can we end the war,  Milton?  He said,  well,  you put it on ABC,  they'll cancel it 
[02:28:30]  in three months.  Oh,  damn,  that's good.  Hunger Games.  Yes,  I'm going.  Hunger Games.  It's wonderful.  And it was really sold out.  Yeah.  Oh,  no,  I believe you.  $155 million.  You have an honest looking face.  Oh,  boy.  But if he said that.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  I'm a little more up.  Well,  you know,  political affiliation  has nothing to do with  who I find entertaining  or who I would  be friends with.  I hope not,  because you'd be alone  in a room.  Hey, 
[02:29:00]  they didn't kill you off  in this movie,  right?  No,  no,  no,  I'm in the four.  Oh,  man.  Have they made more  than one yet?  Sometimes they do,  you know that.  They're making the second one  this summer.  Right.  And then the third  and the fourth.  And they have to,  you know,  do them quickly  because I'm 76.  Well,  if you took that  Animal House deal,  that's like 200 grand.  Oh,  you brought up  the Animal House.  What?  I thought, 
[02:29:30]  see,  four movies  and then it would be  like 50 grand a pop.  Oh,  boy,  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I just felt like  we were all kind of  getting together  and getting along.  No,  no,  no,  we're not.  You misread that completely  because I feel  totally alienated.  I'm sorry,  sir.  You misread that.  I'm out of tea.  I'm miserable.  I was trying to ask.  So there's going to be  at least four movies.  That's cool.  I want to ask you  that.  Can I ask an actor question?  Maybe you'll get to see the fourth.  What?  Can I ask an actor?  Can I ask an acting question? 
[02:30:00]  Oh,  boy.  Oh,  he's looking at me.  I'm not trying to prepare  an answer for you.  How do you,  when you read something,  timing.  How do you make it,  how do you make it yours?  How do you make it your,  like you said,  you didn't memorize  the JFK per se,  you kind of just  soaked it all in.  How do you look at dialogue?  No,  no,  but I'm in,  I knew it word for word.  What I'm saying is,  there's a difference  between memorizing  and knowing. 
[02:30:30]  The end result  is the same,  except the end result  for memorized  is that it comes out  by rote.  It sounds like  certain political speakers,  you know?  Right.  But if you,  if you,  if you know it,  then it just sounds  as if you're talking,  like I'm talking to you,  as opposed to reading off  the teleprompter.  And that comes from  just absolutely going over it  and going over it. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah,  getting it so that it's  an integral part of you.  Yeah.  Are you an actor?  I'm a comedian.  I do a little bit of acting,  but it's my acting is,  let's be honest.  It's okay.  Well,  okay is good.  I thought you were going  to say it was terrible.  I should have.  Roland is freaking out  over here.  I guess Donald has to go.  Can I ask Donald something?  You're a busy man.  Did you have fun today?  Did I have fun here?  Yeah.  I need to know.  I'm so happy it's finished. 
[02:31:30]  No,  I actually had a wonderful time.  Two of you are really terrific.  But it's him  is the one you don't like.  Of course it is.  He's the problem.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I enjoyed the hell out of this.  Yeah,  we loved you.  Donald.  And the Hunger Games  is in theaters now  and obviously  we're absolutely going to go soon.  You don't need a lot of help  from us promoting it.  I know.  I don't even know why you're here.  You could have taken this hour off.  You don't need to promote this.  I flew in from Los Angeles last night. 
[02:32:00]  I fly back this afternoon.  Wow.  Wow.  And as to your question of  you don't know why I'm here.  I don't know why.  I don't know why.  And he's rolling his own luggage.  It's very confusing.  I know.  We're very confused by this Donald Sutherland.  That really was a great entrance.  He just walked by  and gave us the finger  and left his luggage there.  We're an odd man.  I'll never wash that finger.  Okay.  Goodbye, everybody.  Thank you.  It's the worst of 2012 
[02:32:30]  for the O.B. and Anthony Show.  My name is E-Rock.  E-Rock Radio on Twitter.  Please follow me.  Please, please, please, please, please.  I need to beat Sam.  Anyway, in this segment  we'll start off with a big deal  for Sam and the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Sam got married.  Now, in this segment here  Sam's away on his honeymoon  whatever he...  Mini honeymoon.  I'm not quite sure what he was doing  but he wasn't there  and we're all recapping  our time at the wedding.  Did Eastside Dave blow up the place?  How drunk did everybody get? 
[02:33:00]  Did Anthony even show up?  You know this already  because you heard it before.  But we're playing it again.  We recap Sam's wedding right now.  O.B. and Anthony's worst of 2012.  Last time we saw you guys  we're all at a wedding.  I know.  On the heels of the Roberts wedding.  Ooh.  The Sam Roberts wedding.  Where were we?  I guess we could say now, huh?  Yes.  Shithouse, Connecticut.  Yes.  Middletown, Connecticut.  What a weird fucking Main Street  they got.  Anybody walk around? 
[02:33:30]  Oh, no.  You guys kind of came in and...  That way we just winged in  and winged out.  I had to be there Friday  for a rehearsal dinner.  Oh.  And so I had some time to kill.  Yeah.  And that Main Street  is a weird place.  Yeah.  It's like they're trying to go for  like a hip vibe,  like almost hippie-ish.  Oh, please.  Good luck there.  A little chic-ish.  Yeah.  And then you got fucking crackheads  walking around.  Oh, yeah?  I miss those. 
[02:34:00]  And they're mingling with each other.  Really strange.  I didn't see much of anything.  No, because you guys came in.  Yeah.  You were up there for what?  Maybe a total of five hours?  Yeah, probably around there.  What time did we get in?  We got in at literally  not five, but 4.30.  4.30.  Wedding started at five.  Left at 10.  Five and a half hours.  Or 10.30.  About 10.  Yeah, that's about it.  And then...  You did it.  And then out.  And out.  Get the fuck out.  Back to New York. 
[02:34:30]  It was before we, you know,  make fun of some elements.  I do want to say  it was one of the nicer weddings  I've been to.  Oh, it was a blast.  I don't really like going to weddings.  I don't know if I've said this on the air  because they're all the same fucking wedding.  Well, they are.  I like those weddings  where they just have a little twist,  something a little different.  Yeah.  And they had a reception in a barn,  so you didn't feel like  you were in a wedding hall.  I like that.  It was, yeah, a barn.  I liked it, though. 
[02:35:00]  This place called the barn.  Although the AC was out of fucking control.  They had apparently one unit upstairs,  like up in the second level of the barn.  Right.  And the rafters.  Yeah, and the rafters.  No, this was a real barn.  Right.  Just blowing as hard as it could.  On our table.  If you were in the way of that stream,  it was getting a little chilly.  Well, we were.  Our table was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Kenny was raising,  holy hell,  trying to get them to turn that AC off.  It was freezing.  It was fucking freezing.  I felt like a little girl. 
[02:35:30]  Of course it was freaking.  I couldn't handle it.  I couldn't handle the fucking AC.  The women from the table  kept going up and going to the bathroom.  Yeah.  Because they said it was warmer there  because you walked in under the ledge.  Yeah.  Right.  So you didn't have that fucking thing blowing on you.  It was awful.  We were all taking off  our fucking suit jackets  to warm up ladies.  Suit jackets.  To warm up the ladies.  And the dais for the bride and groom  was right behind us  so they must have been getting hit  with the same thing  but they weren't even sitting there really.  No, they were mingling.  They were mingling. 
[02:36:00]  Mingling about the new Roberts couple.  Right.  Yes.  The brand new Mr. and Mrs. Sam Roberts.  That's right.  Boy, did she settle.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  What a fucking...  Talk about out of his league.  She was beautiful.  Yeah.  Absolutely beautiful.  Really fucking unbelievably attractive  in her wedding dress.  Yes.  And she read off her vows up there  and she did an amazing job.  Yeah, Sam does it for a living 
[02:36:30]  and she kicked his ass.  She blew him away.  I can't wait to tell Sam  that when he gets back.  She kicked his ass.  Kicked his ass.  He did okay.  Yeah, he did okay.  But she had a thing.  Yeah.  She had like a...  Like it was a ticker tape.  Yeah, a little scroll.  Like ticker tape.  That was white  so she was kind of reading off that  or referring to that.  Yeah.  Referencing that, I should say.  It wasn't distracting  like she's holding a piece of paper.  Right.  And then it kind of was falling to the floor  but it looked like it was kind of part of her dress.  Right.  Yeah, it was pretty cool.  And she made up all those words herself. 
[02:37:00]  Words.  Stupid getting fucking teary eyeballed at that thing.  I really did.  I don't fucking admit it.  God, she fucking hit it out of the park with her vows.  Well, Kenny's great with the emotion and stuff  because when Jess's best friend got up  and she gave a speech.  Right.  Right from the get-go, Kenny goes,  how long is this going to take?  But he said it loud enough  where like at least three tables were. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  I got a little...  Choked up?  When Jess...  Yeah, because it was nice.  Sam said he was...  I was like, you were about to cry, weren't you?  He goes, yeah.  Because I didn't know that she came out  with some song he really liked,  some dumb Beach Boys song,  but I didn't know the song.  This was the song we did?  What's the song, Eric?  God Only Knows What I'd Do Without You.  Oh.  She walked up the aisle to this.  Oh, right.  Instead of the famous wedding song  we've all heard a million fucking times.  Very groovy. 
[02:38:00]  And who knew that Sam liked this song?  I may not always tell you.  Oh, I know this song.  Of course.  But long as there are stars above you...  Ah, look.  I feel like I'm sitting there again.  You never need...  Know who we need to talk to?  Stinky has no emotions.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, like, I mean,  the vows are pretty intense.  I mean,  a lot of people get, you know,  teared up and shit.  Yeah.  Or others just sat there like,  whatever,  this has nothing to do with me. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  But the one emotion that wasn't around  except for a couple people  was out-and-out laughter.  And one of those people  was Stinky in the back row.  Stinky was just laughing.  He was laughing,  that fucking pothead.  Yeah.  He was probably stoned.  He was just cracking up.  He couldn't handle it.  He couldn't handle it.  There might be some deep emotion  going on for a few minutes.  Yeah.  That cracked me up, though.  Oh, this is, yeah,  this is the song she walked up to.  And then, of course,  Mr. Roberts, 
[02:39:00]  the senior Mr. Roberts,  the father.  The entertainer himself.  The entertainer.  He likes being up on the stage.  Oh, does he love attention,  that guy?  Holy shit.  Yeah.  He has such good hair,  I thought he had a wig.  I thought it was a rug.  Yeah.  He has such a thick,  good head of hair.  He just has those jeans.  He has way too much hair.  Yeah.  And he's an older gentleman  because he had his kids  later in life.  He's an older gentleman  with all his hair stuff.  Way too much fucking hair.  Yeah.  But he did the ceremony. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, he did the whole ceremony  right there.  Apparently, anybody can do that  as long as there's  a justice of the peace  at the end of the whole thing  to sign off on it.  Really?  Yeah.  Where was that guy?  He just had to be  sitting somewhere.  Was he there?  I guess.  And then he signed  all the paperwork afterwards.  What?  He just has to be a witness?  Yeah, I guess so.  That's how that works.  And then Sam's dad  has to pull out the fact  that 44 years ago,  his father married him.  Well, it must be nice  to be part of a family tradition. 
[02:40:00]  Are you part of any family tradition?  Yes, drinking.  There you go.  Yeah.  Sleep apnea.  My father has it  and I have it.  He goes,  44 years ago,  oh, my father married me  and my lovely bride.  With that mustache.  And I'm honored  to do the same here today.  Doesn't he feel like  he should have left  on a hot air balloon  after the ceremony?  You know what I mean?  He's just like  an old school  coming to town  entertainer.  Very oldie time. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  Sam's dad is very oldie time.  Really nice guy, though.  He was very good, though.  He didn't over-talk.  No.  Talked very briefly.  Did a great ceremony.  I like a quick fucking ceremony.  Don't piss me off  with a long mask churchy thing.  Right.  Oh, my God.  I'll show up for the reception  if I know that's happening.  And all the assholes on Twitter  were really happy  that it was raining all day  because they knew  they were trying  to get married outside.  but in the end  for some fucking odd reason 
[02:41:00]  it decided to clear up  just in time  for the ceremony.  Creepy shit.  Yeah.  And then it started raining  afterwards  when we were all in the barn.  Yeah.  In the barn.  A real barn burner.  With a DJ  that might be a fan  of our show.  Oh, yes.  I'm sure he's listening  right now.  Yes.  I appreciate that  you like the show  but let's relax  a little bit.  We don't need to hear  show references  all day long.  I went up to the  I was going up  to the bathroom  and you got to pass  by him  when you go  to the bathroom  and he goes  I just wanted to ask you 
[02:41:30]  have I done anything  that is giving you  douche chills tonight?  And I just looked  at him like  this fucking very moment  asking that question.  He was very excited  because I had to borrow  a tie from him.  Oh.  Yeah.  How do you have to borrow it?  You're going to a wedding.  Dude, I fucking  I was more than prepared.  I had three different shirts  I had a suit  I had belts  I had shoes  and I even saw the tie  in my closet  when I was packing.  The tie. 
[02:42:00]  I don't know where  the tie went.  You have one tie?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Why do you laugh?  Because you're grown up  in so many ways  but there are others  that not so much.  Why would you need  more than one tie?  Because I don't go  to tie events.  But you did.  Yeah.  Occasionally you go  to a tie event.  I don't go to tie events  very much  but it's just  you gotta have  like a couple  of nice suits  and a few ties.  A couple different shirts  that go in my suit. 
[02:42:30]  Some other suit.  There's like  But the one tie  matches all the shirts  I got.  There's kind of  a good mood suit  and then there's  like a funeral suit.  No, they're all the same.  They're all the same suit.  Yeah?  Yeah, because the dead guy  doesn't care what color you wear.  You don't give a fuck.  Oh, right.  You don't care.  I don't like suits.  I don't either.  I hate them  but you know  if you gotta wear them.  I got one really nice tie.  Really nice.  Yeah.  I forgot it.  So the DJ  he got all excited  that he could do something for me. 
[02:43:00]  Oh.  So he went to his car  and he literally  had 50 ties in his car.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  Did he let you keep it?  He wanted me to keep it.  I'm like no.  Keep the tie.  I'm like here.  Here's your tie back.  Yeah.  I go you can put it on eBay.  You probably will get  about seven bucks for it.  Oh.  Because I wore it.  Seven dollars maybe.  Warned at the Roberts wedding  by Greg Opie Hughes.  And then the DJ  couldn't help himself  just before the lovely couple  were making their way  into the barn  for the first time.  The guy wished  little Jimmy 
[02:43:30]  a very happy birthday.  That's how he started.  Yeah, that was the first thing  he said pretty much.  I looked at Jimmy  and he even was like  you know  we're assholes  and all but Jesus.  I took a wave  to the crowd.  You did wave.  Half of them were like  what does that even mean?  Yeah.  Oh boy.  It was important.  Well, it was  there were some very  typical parts  of the wedding  where you know  it just happens.  I am a 
[02:44:00]  I am a people watcher  at the wedding  and boy  were there some things  to watch  at the Roberts wedding.  Every wedding there is.  Every wedding  there is a bunch  of people  you can make fun of.  Yeah.  The older broads  that try to do  the sexy dance  is just  I  it was beyond me.  They are sexy  in their own minds still.  Oh boy.  Yeah they are.  There 
[02:44:30]  there was a  couple of women  dancing there  that night.  One in particular  oh my god.  We'll call them  Monster and Sir.  Oh god.  This show got too popular.  They're all listening  right now.  I remember the days  we could do this break  and you know  no one fucking  listened to our show  after going to a wedding. 
[02:45:00]  They're all listening  right now.  I just think  Danny's got  a video rolling  of some  horrendous dancer  at a wedding  girl dancing  at a wedding.  She'll be gone  down soon.  Oh she takes  a fucking dive.  I'm sure.  She falls  she's got to fall  yeah.  Oh she's all hammered.  Oh there she goes  right on her ass.  She wearing panties?  Barely.  I don't know  what the fuck  is going on there.  Barely.  Yeah well this  this woman was dancing  and doing her sexy dance  and making sexy faces 
[02:45:30]  while she's dancing  and she's wearing  like a white  kind of dress  little short thing  and sticking her ass out  looking over her shoulder  putting her fists  on her hips  her fists  on her hips  and shaking her ass  and making a  dancey sexy face  almost doing like  a Mick Jagger  remember when Mick Jagger  used to do that?  Yes yes  it almost looks like  a chicken  speaking of Mick Jagger  Jimmy  Jimmy turns me 
[02:46:00]  he goes hey  I want to  I want to go  later on  I want to talk  to Charlie Watts  she looked  exactly like  Charlie Watts  Charlie Watts  can you put  Charlie Watts  oh my god  oh my god  horrendous  it was Charlie Watts  Dr. Zachary Smith  yeah  she looked like  Dr. Smith  oh dear  oh my god  oh my god  oh my god  and the  the whole 
[02:46:30]  sexy dancing  thing  was really  getting me  and then  Jimmy  Jimmy decided to  point out her  calves  same woman  yes  oh were they  big  they were  big calves  I wasn't sure  if she used  to be a man  for real  I don't know  she had calves  like a man  absolutely  a man's legs  yeah she did  there was some  sculpturing going on  in her face  that was suspicious  Jimmy pointed out  that she had  she was all happy  because she made  the covers of  the cover of 
[02:47:00]  calves monthly  I was just cracking up  thinking how awful  that magazine would be  yeah  calves monthly  what a low sub rate  that must have  yes  Jimmy had some lines  where I couldn't  catch my breath  and then because  I was laughing so  fucking hard  Jimmy started laughing  so fucking hard  yes you have  that upside down  calf V thing  the upside down  valentine's day heart  yes  yes  that's a lot of  working out  it really is right  I think so  I think that's a lot  of running 
[02:47:30]  no wait  biking  no what  anything with  running  biking  walking  biking  makes your  fucking thighs  big  oh my god  look at those  whatever  oh god  look at these  women  what the fuck  is that  what does she do  to herself  calves.com  I guess  what site is this  calves  it's calves  monthly.com  that's nice  that's a nice  calf  I like a woman  with a good calf  a good calf  yeah  the other  line you did 
[02:48:00]  the other woman  with the big  head  face  awful  we all  looked at her  oh yeah  and we just  knew  she was the one  that we dubbed  Samantha  from Sex and the City  oh really  oh yeah  but Jimmy goes  she was going  after the only  two black guys  on the dance floor  oh boy  was she  oh yeah  oh yeah  oh well  ah  she was just  dancing  but Jimmy  walks up to me  and goes  have you seen  Giant Face yet  and I knew 
[02:48:30]  exactly who  he was talking  exactly  that's how  big her face  was  I couldn't  I couldn't  catch my breath  I started laughing  so fucking hard  when you say  who's Giant Face  and everybody  knows  oh yeah  that's the one  exactly who  you're talking  about  and then  Jimmy was giving  me Giant Face  scenarios  because she was  dancing on the  dance floor  yes  I'm not going  to be able  to do it  justice  it was something  about  that her face  gives a forced  perspective  so she had to  keep telling  her dance partner  you don't have  to keep back 
[02:49:00]  I'm not getting  closer  it's just  the illusion  my face gives  like she would  lean in and  whisper that  because she had  that giant head  so it looked  like everyone  danced with it  backed up a little  but she was a  classic that lady  everyone thought  she was getting  right in their  face but it's  like no  it just looks  that way  it's an illusion  that trick in  your rear view  mirror  that's all  it is  I'm here  I'm okay  she's a big  lady  god I was dying  to tweet  and make videos  but we had to  show some respect  unfortunately  yeah  I tweeted a couple  of things  yeah little things  we were able to do  east side Dave 
[02:49:30]  obviously but  you know  oh god  yeah it was  it was a lot of fun  and you guys met  Bobby for the first  time  yes  I didn't realize  it was the first  time I met her  though  who's a star  on this radio  show Sam's mom  I really thought  I had met her  before  I would have  sworn to you  that I had met  Sam's mother  I'm like I knew  what she looked  like  I'm like yeah  yeah I've met  her before  she's really nice  yeah  first time I met  her was this  weekend  yeah  what a nice  woman though  comes up  oh thank you  oh thank you  so much for  coming  it's like  what  I can wing 
[02:50:00]  in I wing  out  right  yeah  skin off  my ass  oh god  it was fun  it was a good  time  definitely  yeah  that fucking  bartender  pissed me off  why  I go up  there and I  ask for a couple  of drinks  and you know  you're only allowed  two drinks  which is fine  you know  but then at the  last minute  Jimmy kind of  leans over  and he's like  Anthony could you  get me a Diet Coke  there was a line  and he was in  the front line  I already had  two drinks  and it was a  long line at  that point 
[02:50:30]  so I was like  oh oh  could I get a  Diet Coke  also  and he's looking  over my head  not even  acknowledging me  going yeah  yeah you  come here  come up here  come up here  like like  don't even  bother talking  to me  I was like  hello  Diet Coke  it's not like  I'm getting  three drinks  Jimmy's right there  and stuff  the other guy  got it though  yeah the other guy  really  what was that  I'm just like  fuck it  well it was about  him not getting  fucking tip  that's what it  was about  bastard  what a dummy  it's like  he blew off 
[02:51:00]  the biggest tipper  in the place  what a dope  he's an asshole  what a dope  good for him  fucko  I tipped the other  guy great too  his partner  although they  probably split  the tips  they probably  split them  god damn it  yeah  of course  or they just  from what I hear  in this scandal  that's going on  a lot of these  catering halls  they collect the tips  from the staff  and they just  pay them  their wage  and actually  the venue  keeps the tips  what  yeah  there's a  class action  suit going on  with some  fucking union  there's a union  of catering 
[02:51:30]  hall workers  apparently  right  and they've been  just taking  their tips  what  and keeping it  and then they  just pay the  fucking staff  what they pay  them  how do they  do that  god  I know  it's amazing  right  I don't know  I would assume  that's not  happening at all  wedding halls  not at all  of them  but there's  a few  that are  doing that  a few  shysters  out there  how do you  allow that  why wouldn't  you just keep  reaching in  and grabbing  your tips  and why would  you  I know  right  yeah  they probably  fire you  catering hall  tips are a little  different  it's not like  people leave 
[02:52:00]  money on the  tables  I think it  might be  something that's  built into  a bill  included in  the bill  you know what  I mean  and then the  workers never  see that  right  I think  that's probably  more of a scam  I'm just  you know  that makes sense  but they're not  just grabbing  their jars  off the thing  well that's the  thing  I mean I've  never been to  a wedding  where I left  a 20 on the  table  you know  hey good  service  that was great  okay  I've done that  or I find a  guy  I find the  one guy  that was  good to us  find the guy  I didn't this  weekend  because there  was no real  guy  no there  wasn't  right  I like when 
[02:52:30]  there's a  guy you  could just  hey get me  drinks  yeah  I had to  keep getting  up and  getting drinks  food was  awesome  yeah  usually wedding  food sucks  wedding food  it was awesome  did you have  the salmon  I did  and I hadn't  eaten all day  that corn  relish thing  yeah the corn  was very  oh the corn  relish  talking about  corn relish  but it was  good  holy fuck  that was a  nice combination  Sam's mother's  cookie was  fucking phenomenal  she didn't  fucking cook  them  she said  I heard  you baked  that  I thought  she did  there's  controversy  she goes  everyone's  asking me  but I didn't 
[02:53:00]  last thing  I want to  do is  cook 200  cookies  the night  before the  wedding  because in  her mind  she has to  do it  right before  the wedding  so they  stay fresh  because I  felt the  cookie was  a little  lackluster  I was just  being polite  yeah I  didn't think  the cookie  was that  great  yeah  she would  have done  a much  better job  it's going  to drive  her nuts  that she  didn't cook  that now  yeah  Roland you  have a good  time at the  wedding  what was your  highlight sir  the cake  was delicious  the cake  was delicious  yeah  drink  ate  I just woke up

[02:58:30]  all he really  did was  fling himself  onto the  dance floor  at one point  literally throwing  himself onto  the floor  yeah  and screaming  like ow  ow  I don't really  know what that  means  I don't either  but that's  what he does  I don't really  understand it  it's his gimmick  it's his thing  he falls down  and yells how  much it hurt him  then he would  get up and  kind of walk  off like  James Brown  and like  Sam's kind  of consoling  him  and then  he pushed  Sam away  and run  and jump  and fall  back down  on the dance  floor  and throw  himself back  on the floor  again  it's the weirdest 
[02:59:00]  thing to watch  I think I got  like 20 seconds  of it  maybe I'll post  it  it's just  really  I don't know  what to do  with it  it's so strange  he's a great  guy though  oh I love him  I fucking love  his side  Dave  I think he's  really talented  and this company  really fucked him  over  although he's  kind of doing  a little  couple hours  on the weekend  right  on Saturdays  yeah  when is the show  7pm on Saturdays  Davey Mack  sports program  oh  he should be  full time though  there's a nice  plug  another good  portion of the 
[02:59:30]  wedding was  during one of  the speeches  where there was  an emotional  pause  and Kenny  just goes  he lost  his place  yeah  right  and once again  everyone heard  it  easily  he lost  his place  yeah  yeah  Kenny's hard  to figure out  did he have  a good time  he's ass  burger-y  and an ass  does he have  a good time  yeah  it was very  nice  he acknowledges  what a good  time looks like  and knows how  to say  that's what  it was  it was  a fun 
[03:00:00]  time  his text  to me  was like  it was  good  hanging  with you  you are  good  people  at least  it came  from the  heart  yeah  it was  nice  to hang  out  with you  you are  good  people  hope  you have  a safe  traffic  free  ride  home  traffic  free  see you  tomorrow  you're  good  people  what a  guy  he sees  me  every  day  hey  erock  were you  high  yeah  that night 
[03:00:30]  didn't end  well  for me  why  what happened  really  yeah  did you  vomit  uh  little  vomit  two  two  attempts  and  nothing  came  out  but  then  wait  you  were  feeling  queasy  yeah  about  2 30  in the  morning  how much  do you  hate  puking  and  i feel  that it's  coming  but nothing  is happening  so i'm like  all right  i just go  to bed  and then  about an  hour and a  half later  all of a sudden  i thought i  shit my  pants  and i'm  checking  i'm like  no no  and i go  running to  the bathroom  and i  didn't  but as  soon as  i turned  on the  light  and pulled  my pants 
[03:01:00]  down  to check  that's  when it  happened  whoa  you shit  where  jesus  wait you  didn't puke  you shit  yourself  yeah  oh my  god  well wait  how much  did you have  like what  led up to  this  what  it was  highing  and drinking  all night  and then  you got  high  the buffet  at 2am  didn't help  either  the after  party  i heard  there was  a breakfast  buffet  where was  it  at the 
[03:01:30]  tavern  that was  in the  hotel  bacon  maple  sausage  how was  it  it hit  the spot  oh it  went right  through me  so how  bad  did you  shit  yourself  as soon  as i  got into  the bathroom  i turned  the light  on  i pulled  my shorts  down  to see  and i  i bend  down  to look  and that's  when it  happened  so i  i got  most of  it right  into the  toilet  but  oh god  damn  most of  it  some of  it  oh yuck 
[03:02:00]  let's just  say that  the people  who have  to clean  that room  aren't going  to be too  happy with  the towels  that were  left hidden  behind the  curtains  in the  bathtub  you cleaned  up with  the shit  with towels  i didn't know  what else to  do  oh my god  yeah  i gotta  throw the  towels away  about the  elevator  garbage  yeah  yeah  yeah  i don't know  how to  clean up  fucking shit  towels  in a hotel room  mister  well i know  for next time  now  that dumb  little garbage  pile in between  the elevator doors  the two elevator doors 
[03:02:30]  shove it in there  shove it in the big  the tall  ashtray  standing ashtray  thing  yeah  the small one  yeah  oh god  that's your highlights  from the wedding  you shitting yourself  uh  oh and eastside dave  getting shit on  dave  oh with the sparklers  too  there were sparklers  yeah  oh we missed  the sparklers  yeah  and uh  dave shot a nice  little video  with sparklers  that's alright  i posted that  is it on the  facebook page  it's on the  facebook page  yeah  all in all  a very nice affair 
[03:03:00]  i thought  very nice  very  uh  unique  to be in the barn  and uh  the food was  fucking great  i was starving  because i had woken up late  and uh  aunt said  why don't you come up  because i gotta stop  in the city  alright  i took a  i wasn't  i was gonna drive up  but i'm like  why would i drive  when i could  hop in a car  take the old limo up  oh  and uh  i'm glad i did that  because i was tired  not feeling like driving  after  yeah  i didn't eat  i didn't have time to eat  that sounds like a good time 
[03:03:30]  oh it was fucking  nothing better than  not having to drive  back  right  from a wedding  because you know  you know  i know i'm gonna be  tipping a few back  and uh  yeah  you just wanna  fucking be driving  you didn't seem like  you were tipping too many though  no i was actually  in pretty good shape  i don't know  it was just such a pain  in the ass to get a drink  oh really  i had to keep getting up  and go to the bar  it was in another room  yeah  so i just was like  and then you know  they give you the little  fucking shot glass of drink  instead of a nice big  fucking burly glass  instead of a man's drink 
[03:04:00]  yeah you know  eh  it was alright  yeah  and i got  when we got home  later on  jimmy actually came  by the house  and uh  i was like  yeah i'm gonna make a drink  and then i was like  i can't even fucking  can't even drink  just didn't feel like it  didn't have it in me  uh saturday night  for some reason  that's a late night  yeah yeah  oh yeah  you went back out to ants  after getting home  from the wedding  not that  i got home by uh  get back to the city  by 12  late or night 
[03:04:30]  even at 12  oh alright  yeah  on a saturday  it's like it was  but those are your hours  i don't like going to bed  early on a weekend  like yeah  i like uh  like you're missing something  yeah i like being up  nice and late  and going to bed late  on a late saturday night  yeah  it's something that's  for me it's a healthy  thing to do  it's like yeah  you're going out  hanging with a friend  nothing deviant  yeah  nothing terrible  you know  because i tend to uh  left my own device  on a saturday night  although shoving  those hot dogs  up your ass  was not uh  yeah but at least  i didn't eat them  shoving them in my ass  was one thing  eating them was unhealthy 
[03:05:00]  i was hungry  yeah but believe me  if i was fucking  if i was riding around  by myself  i'd be shoving  other hot dogs  up my ass  so it was better  i don't have any  ketchup daddy  daddy  so it was fun  yeah  congratulations  by the way  do you know  sam and jess  they had chicken  fingers  at the fucking  oh yeah  but no  and also  at the  little reception  the cocktail hour  oh right  right right  there was chicken  fingers  little fries  little fries  fucking uh 
[03:05:30]  cheese and crackers  but that's way better  than a dumb mushroom thing  would you like a dumb mushroom thing  it was great  they don't even know  what it is  at some of these weddings  oh yeah yeah  but they had a tiny little thing  where it was like  four or five french fries  in a little like  a dixie cup type  little paper cone thingy  i thought that was great  yes  i was all in as far as that goes  i love my three french fries  this  opian anthony's worst of 2012  worst of opian anthony 2012 edition 
[03:06:00]  my name is iraq  we're looking back at the year that was for the opian anthony show  you just heard sam's wedding  we recap that  now we're going to talk to sam about his honeymoon  sam goes off to hawaii with his lovely bride  and uh we hear stories about  where'd they go  where'd they stay  what did they do  what did they eat  all the cool things that you could do in hawaii  did they do them  well sam thought he did  we thought otherwise  as we recap sam's hawaiian honeymoon  part one 
[03:06:30]  opian anthony's worst of 2012  how was your honeymoon  oh it was awesome  it was great  we went to maui  and then kawaii  i don't know what that means  they're islands  i know they're islands  but i don't know what that means  what's the difference between the two  well maui is like a more touristy type place  i heard it's wowie  yeah maui was very wowie  is maui where they do all the surfing  and the hotels are all big right on the beach  uh yeah i mean they do that  a lot of the islands  i mean they do the  honolulu is like the big city  just call it 
[03:07:00]  we call it the islands  why would you go from one island to the next  if it's hawaii  well kawaii is like a more sort of  look at you  you know all the islands  hey big shot  you were in a plane for like 80 hours  and then all of a sudden  you're gonna start taking more flights  to go to another island  who fucking why'd you settle down  because  you get a different  settle down  i don't understand these people  that they go on vacation  then they have to do more vacation  and more traveling  yeah more traveling on your vacation  you saw the brochure  pick a hotel and settle down 
[03:07:30]  you get a different experience  we flew into honolulu  and then from there  took a quick puddle jumper  over to uh maui  how long was the flight  to honolulu  11 hours  holy  was it non-stop  yeah  were you in coach  yeah  how was it  it wasn't bad  actually no the flight there  wasn't bad at all  because it was a big plane  it was hawaiian airlines  which is nice  they give you food  and uh  it's the 3-4-2 setup  you know the row across  yeah  and jess and me  were in the middle section 
[03:08:00]  and there was no  other two people with us  oh okay  so we had the four seats  to spread out across  how would you allow yourself  to be in the middle section  how would you not have gone  in advance and checked that out  I at least need a window  to check out shit  oh hell yeah  because we figured out  I told her that this is what we'll do  because we found  there were two seats  and then  one seat  so there was  there's no way that somebody's  going to take a middle seat  in a middle section  just by themselves  so I was like  we'll at least have three seats  to ourselves  we can stretch out a little bit  okay  and then the fourth seat guy 
[03:08:30]  wasn't there  Sam's  okay that was smart planning  were you all crampy  by the time your plane landed  the seats were surprisingly spacious  wait till you get a little older man  your knees are going to ache  yeah  from those 11 hour flights  wait was it Hawaiian Air  or Aloha Air  no Hawaiian Airlines  okay  because that's probably  the one you want to fly  the one that's constantly  going over the ocean  and having salt water erosion  that didn't hurt  a few years ago  I don't think you'd want that one  no you really wouldn't  when the roof got ripped off  and the woman got sucked out  right  oh man 
[03:09:00]  how great would that be  if the only thing that saved him  was his shitty hair  he just fucking clogged up the hole  oh my god sorry  like a drain  they appear to be new planes though  they're really nice planes  okay  they want you to think  they're new planes  they give you meals in coach  oh yeah  yeah the seats go back further  what do you mean they give you meals  you're in the sky for 11 hours  they better feed you  nobody gets fed in coach anymore  they charge you man  they charge you  even for 11 hours  they give you free blanket and pillow  they give you free meal  wow in coach  yeah  alright Hawaiian Air  might be the fucking shit then  the seats are wider  and they go back further 
[03:09:30]  what's the first class seats look like  I couldn't see them  wait didn't you walk through it  oh I love it  did they have it where you walk in  and you to the right  and you to the left  oh I love that  they had two separate doors  in the flight bag  you might have had big stars on your plane  you don't even know it  no clue  wow  I looked at business class though  yeah  it really didn't look very much different from coach  it was  it was like  $350 to upgrade  soon  and you didn't  what a chiseler  wait how much to upgrade  to business  $350 a seat  and it didn't look any different  he's a cheap 
[03:10:00]  Sam's a cheap  I gave you a nice wedding gift  you should have used a few bucks  to fucking do the right thing  you are  you had the money  that's terribly cheap  you had the money  no  that's exactly the stuff that you hated  that your dad would do  like  it's your honeymoon  stop being your dad  and you could upgrade  to at least business  for $350 more a seat  you know what  your next honeymoon  you could do the right thing  you're nuts dude  even Jess saw it  and she said  the business class looks like  it's exactly the same as coach  it was the same number of seats  there couldn't have been that much more  it's a lot different 
[03:10:30]  trust me  I've flown business  it's a lot different  you should have done the right thing  you need therapy  you're gonna be just like your dad  that's OCD dude  we flew very comfortably still  that's OCD  you had the money  you just had a wedding  where you did very well  you brought in a lot of fucking loot  but we had to do like  nine days in Hawaii  that ain't cheap  no but for  if you would have said  it's a thousand extra a seat  that's crazy  but an extra $350 a seat  you're flying for 11 hours  and it's only $350  to be a little more comfortable  you do that  and you'd be a lot more comfortable  in business 
[03:11:00]  the food is much better  because you're probably getting  first class meals  food  alright  you're getting much better service  the chairs go way back  it's much better  yeah you sleep  alright enough with the dumb flight  so what'd you do?  we did a lot of relaxing  a lot of pool time  but then you had to get on another plane  and go relax on another island  that's so stupid  no  because the island flights are not bad  no  you relax in Maui  and you also drive around  we did the road to Hana  what?  what does that mean? 
[03:11:30]  they have all these roads in Hawaii  they're like these little skinny roads  and you're driving up mountains and stuff  are they interstates?  sounds dangerous  no they're not interstates  they're islands  I think they're still called interstate highways  even though you know  that's dumb  because there's no other states  maybe they are  interstate  yeah  we had to sign a thing  when we rented the car  that said we wouldn't drive to Mexico  really?  I pointed out the absurdity  as I was signing it  that is pretty good  how about they adjust the forms  for the Hawaii people  yeah  so what?  you relaxed and then got on another plane 
[03:12:00]  to relax somewhere else  that so doesn't make sense to me  the flight from Maui to Kauai  is only like 45 minutes  that's way too long  Kauai was great  they had like five pools  and a salt water lagoon  but didn't you have pools  where you were?  not as nice pools  as in Kauai  but you were in the air  for 11 hours  the pools better be fucking nice  they were  they were very nice in Maui  why are you in a pool  if you were in a plane  for 11 hours?  wouldn't you go in the ocean  at that point?  I went in the ocean too  you could have been in a pool  in fucking  what do you call it? 
[03:12:30]  Bestchester?  Bestchester  oh god  but we get in  because you get in the pool  and you can get out  and take a dip in the ocean  come out of the ocean  go back in the pool  get in the salt water lagoon  in Kauai  in Kauai  you can drive around  and see more of the local flavor  it's a little less touristy  oh well  I think island hopping  is just dumb  no it's great  you pick a good one  and then you hang out  because they're different  how long did you stay on one island  and then go to the next one?  we did like  five days on one  and four days on another 
[03:13:00]  alright  that's not that bad  as long as you're not going back and forth  and how long the flight  is it an hour?  between islands?  less than an hour  you commute every day  for vacation  that would suck  it sounds like your vacation was awful  no it was great  it sounds horrible  it doesn't sound horrible at all  you're in a pool  and then went in the ocean  and then back to the pool  that's what we do on Long Island  yeah  what the fuck  first of all  it's not Long Island  it's a little nicer than Long Island  it's an island  it's tropical  same thing  an island  and you can see  like the maps  they don't do anything  in the center of these islands 
[03:13:30]  like there's a few roads  and they all do  around the perimeter of Hawaii  because that's where the ocean is  and there's nothing else going on  they don't have roads at all  so we were driving on the roads  but they don't even do it  around the whole island  you can drive  until the road just ends  oh it just stops  and then you turn around  because that would have been  a shitty beach  I guess so  they finally realized  the road was a waste of time  and they just end it  yeah  they just stopped the road  that's weird  you just turn around  like an asshole  and go back  it's terrible  you get to look at everything  did you do a helicopter ride  over a volcano 
[03:14:00]  no  yeah why do that  we drove up  do that next time  you're in Hawaii  yeah why not  why wouldn't you do that  it's like $200 a person  holy fuck  we drove  we drove up a canyon  you  hold on  you realize  that you're gonna look back  on this  and you didn't spend  the $200  to take a helicopter  over a volcano  I didn't want  that's a once in a lifetime  no you should see  everything there is to see  I mean  I'm not  we were not  leaving  it was only $200  that's not bad 
[03:14:30]  did she want to do anything  that you guys didn't do  no  okay  she was very happy  and relaxing  well she's probably signed  she knows his sickness  like she knows he's OCD  so she's probably just  kind of toes the company  lying like oh Sam  it's the same seats up there  were you sitting there  figuring out how much money  you're saving  no  oh damn  I just saved $400  on that helicopter ride  although we were  we would comment together  when we would have a dinner  that was less expensive  than we thought it was  going to be  going look at this  but I would also tell her  don't worry  we can spend a little money  because we're not doing  a helicopter ride  so don't worry 
[03:15:00]  you could have spent  the money anyway  it's the only time  hopefully you'll do it  you didn't see a volcano  I mean we didn't see  the top of a volcano  I'll say  did you do the bike ride  no I didn't  we didn't want a bike ride  does the bike ride  what the sunrise  you didn't do that either  I hear that's an amazing experience  no we didn't  you bring it to the top  of a mountain  you watch the sun  fucking come up  and then you take  the ride down  we were talking to people  you gotta pick  which day you go  very carefully  because lots of people  go up  but it's an overcast day  and they don't see anything 
[03:15:30]  yeah but that's fun too  you're on the top  of a mountain  but you don't see anything  you just see clouds  how about you're on the top  of the mountain  as the day starts  that's kind of neat  we spoke to people  who came back down  and they were like  we didn't even see  a fucking sunrise  do they speak like that  no  okay  are you throwing  the fuck for flavor  yeah  local flavor  I hate when people do that  Sam's spicing up  like this edgy vacation  right  were you starting to  talk to the people  at the hotel  and stuff like  aloha  were you saying aloha  I never said aloha 
[03:16:00]  I made a point of not to  I said hey how you doing  every time somebody said aloha  wouldn't that just be fun  no not to say aloha  that's not how I talk  I think that would be  just fun to do  did you visit Pearl Harbor  no  we didn't go on  sightseeing tours  how much was the Pearl Harbor trip  we could save that money too  where's Pearl Harbor  oh my god  did you take a surfing lesson  this is all  a surf  no actually I told you  I would never take a surfing lesson  this is stuff you do in Hawaii though  no because I can't go home and surf  so why take a lesson  because it's you're in Hawaii 
[03:16:30]  and you're like  oh hey  let's try surfing  no I'm not going to pretend I'm Hawaiian  I'm there for nine days  I'm not  what the fuck did you do  we walked everywhere  we saw everything  you could walk everywhere in Westchester  did you go into a cave  and find a tiki  did you suck Mr. Hanalei's dick  I do nothing wrong  as he's fucking Sam's there  with his pants around his ankles  Sam  Sam once again doesn't disappoint  we went into some caves  we went into some caves  oh you did  we rented a car  every day I had a car  and it was a convertible  a convertible 
[03:17:00]  yeah I thought we were really slick  because we got a Mustang  when we went to Maui  I was like yeah  we're going to be cruising around  in a Mustang  how was that  I didn't realize every person  who goes to Maui  we rented a Mustang  the island is crawling  with white people and Mustangs  so obviously it didn't splurge on the car  they just happened to have some  you know nice wheels  we got a convertible  I mean what  how much more money was that  I don't remember  when we booked the trip  we were like yeah  we'll do convertible both places  plus a Mustang stinks  because it's rear wheel drive  I would have got a front wheel drive  I would have gotten a sensible car  any 
[03:17:30]  a sob  any mishaps  at all  in Hawaii  any mishaps  I don't think so  I mean it was just  ooh everything went swimmingly  everything was nice  we got to  you know  nothing  we didn't plan anything out  in advance  because that would mean money  no  that's what that means  I'm reading between the lines  relax  we had a nice breakfast buffet  included with the hotel  every day  so you know what you do  yeah  eat heavy breakfast  skip lunch  who's with me  I 
[03:18:00]  you are  who's with me  I have done that in the past  he's a total  I'm not gonna lie  nine days in a row  pinch penny  no lunch in Hawaii  for nine days  so then helicopter ride  no  go alright  we're gonna sacrifice lunch  but I'm gonna show you a volcano  from a helicopter  yeah  look  you can  we were doing our own  and Jess likes to work out  so the bike thing  would have been nice for her  we hit the gym  in the hotel  and then the surfing lesson  would have been kinda cool  like look at us  and then you got pictures  of your surfing  that you could show your kids someday  look  I pretended I knew how to surf 
[03:18:30]  one time when I was in Hawaii  that's not fun  could you wipe out  I didn't go surfing  he's been waiting to play that  for a while  why not just play along  you idiot  I saw his finger on the button  something was wrong  how about the condoms  no there were no condoms  I mean we haven't used condoms  since we were married  oh yeah  no condoms  are you guys  you know  trying  no  no  can't afford a helicopter ride  let alone a baby 
[03:19:00]  you could have afforded that  no we're not  we're not trying to have any children  you did very well at your wedding  yeah we did  we're trying to  bank some of that  you should have like pushed  a few of those bucks  to the vacation  a helicopter ride  we didn't even care about  the helicopter ride  I went to the Grand Canyon  I was like yeah  I gotta see this  from my fucking helicopter  it's a no brainer  we didn't care about  the helicopter ride  there went  the only helicopter ride  worth doing  that we didn't do  was in Kauai  cause it takes you  cause that's where  they filmed Jurassic Park  oh  and you can only get to that  waterfall by helicopter 
[03:19:30]  why wouldn't you do that  like they did in Jurassic Park  right  why would you do that  because I don't go on movie tours  when I go on vacation  it's still  yeah exactly  it's still a cool waterfall  to check out  and you just pretend  you're looking at the island  like the old guy did  when he got off the helicopter  take my picture  no no no  there's no reason to  what was the  number one thing  you did on vacation  like the one thing  where you're like  the wow moment  uh  I really liked  driving up  the  I think it was  the Wamelea Canyon  something like that  but it took like 
[03:20:00]  driving  40 minutes  that's what he enjoyed  the most  driving  driving up a hill  40 minutes  up a hill  you get to  you can see  it's very scenic  plus we went on a road  who's Nick  by accident  you're good  there was way longer  and nobody else  was driving on it  so it was a little like  uh oh  where are we going  cause it was the wrong road  oh  and all the street signs  had bullet holes in them  ah  but  that's nice  we got to the top  of the canyon  got to see the  beautiful scenery  beautiful canyon  way up high 
[03:20:30]  and drive back down  it's amazing in Hawaii  how are the hotels  really nice  did you stay in the  honeymoon suite  no  why would you  we just had a room  oh man  not even a honeymoon suite  uh  oh boy  ocean view costs a lot more  why would you  no  actually  hold on  I understand  like  like you have a checklist  and you go  alright we can't do  all these things obviously  so maybe we'll blow off  the you know  the ocean view  so we can do  the helicopter ride  we're just chilling  and maybe we'll blow off  the surfing lesson  to you know  just chilling 
[03:21:00]  yeah  how long you spending  in the room anyway  am I right  keep the curtains drawn  who cares  what difference does it  make where you are  you want an ocean view  let's go to the beach  what was your view  in Hawaii  the first night  of the honeymoon  was not a good view  what was the view  for her  from  the first night  yeah  cause we had to  switch the room  you had to switch rooms  why  oh what happened  well we got to the hotel  and they said  you're in  tarantula  no  oh no  no  AIDS  playing on dad's ribs 
[03:21:30]  love that one  yeah it's an oldie  but a goodie  oh I love that  we were in room 101  oh  which we were like  okay  don't go into room 101  yeah  room 101  in any hotel  has to be  the worst place  the worst  has to be  because then we find out  the lobby is on floor 3  oh  so it's the basement  you're in the basement  of the fucking  you were in a hotel  in a basement in Hawaii  so  wait did you have  no window views  well we went 
[03:22:00]  this is just the first night  we went  we got down the elevator  you never disappoint  we got  we got down the elevator  and we looked out  oh  and directly across  from our room  is the hotel  a little piggy  blowing some man  did someone spill  a fucking  avocado  avocado  on you  so what happened  you were going downstairs  to go to the  the goose and duck  soiree  directly across 
[03:22:30]  from our room  is the  hotel  doctor's office  holy shit  which immediately  we were like  what  and then we look  and we're like  wait that's 101  directly to our right  we were actually  the room next to  both  the elevator  and the ice machine  holy shit  we went into the room  what a racket  our view  yeah  was directly below  the valet parking lot  it was like  one of those basements  where you can half  see out the window 
[03:23:00]  holy shit  in Hawaii  no one gets that room  and  there was construction  on the other side  of the room  right outside the room  I would have been  out of my  so what happened  what did you do  we immediately  called  you had the worst  travel agent ever  who was your travel agent  I don't remember  they stink  you're right  why would they  put you in room 101  in Hawaii  it was terrible  we called the front desk  and they were sold out  that night  and maybe it's because  paging Mr. Herman  paging Mr. Herman  you have a telephone call  at the front desk  maybe it was because 
[03:23:30]  we checked in late  and so maybe that's why  maybe we didn't have  a room room  yeah they were like  this is the last one  but so we had  and we didn't care  the first night  because we were exhausted  that room is for the  for the staff  when they're tired  right  and you know  they have some kind of  function like  you know  room 101  just fucking sleep  I'm going to sleep  right  what hotel  what's the hotel  it was a Hyatt  okay  yeah  it was so bad  that you know  we switched the room  and the next day  in the afternoon  they put us  in a different room  so 10%  over 10%  of your occasion 
[03:24:00]  was wasted  in a shitty room  no we didn't spend  10% in the room  we were in Hawaii  but one night  one out of your  nine nights  yeah but many of those  hours were spent  unconscious  asleep  so it didn't matter  so now what room  did they put you in  from your exhausting  flight because you  didn't upgrade  exactly  all the sleep  you should have  gotten on the plane  Sam is a good  spin doctor  but it ain't  happening today sir  well when we got  to the front desk  to be like  you know  we're switching rooms  we were told  blah blah blah  the guy was like  okay what room 
[03:24:30]  are you coming from  and we said 101  and he looked at us  and went ah  the creme de la creme  oh see they know  they told us  that's what they call  a last cell room  what was the upgrade  the upgrade  we looked out over  a nice mountain  what floor  um  fifth  how big was the hotel  probably eight floors  okay  that's acceptable  but your travel agent  I hope he's right  your travel agent  fucking eats asshole  because they should have  said look this is a  honeymoon couple  yes  take care of them 
[03:25:00]  honeymoon couple  yes  usually that means  something  yeah  although probably  the whole hotel  was filled with  honeymoons  yeah everyone there  that's a real hack  honeymoon  must have been where  they put the interracial  couples too I bet  oh in 101  and they were like  ah put this fuck in  that's right  they call it the  Heidi Klum suite  I don't know  I don't know  what Sam's problem  the Heidi Negro  I don't know  what Sam's problem  is  gotta hide him  in the basement  oh  Jesus  Sam's got a real 
[03:25:30]  problem  yeah he's a  Jesus  and I'm sure  we'll hear it  later today  oh you guys  have money  blah blah blah  when I didn't  have money  I just did  the right thing  oh yeah  it's called debt  look into it  you know how to  splurge a little bit  we're not talking  about blowing  a lot of money  350 a seat  on your honeymoon  to upgrade  to business  from coach  is a massive  upgrade  mistake number one  that was mistake  mistake number two  no fucking  helicopter ride  to either the  waterfall  or the fucking  volcano  we didn't care 
[03:26:00]  about the helicopter  that's mistake  number two  mistake number  three  no surf lesson  while you're in  Hawaii  the surf lesson  is stupid  why would you  take a lesson  in something  that you can't do  did you go to  a luau  no  we were like  that's lame too  did Jess take  a hula lesson  no she didn't  take a hula lesson  number four  you know why  the luau is lame  because you have  to sit around  and talk to other  people who are  staying in your hotel  so  that's the worst  but then you  could say  please pass the  poi  please pass the  poi  what is poi  I don't know  some fucking  traditional dish 
[03:26:30]  ye pig  and you know  no  but you know  what we did  we were smart  we went to  dinner  and the luau  is outside  right  so guess who  watched the  performances  without going  inside the luau  oh my god  was the luau  charge  oh my god  oh yeah  he's like a hundred  hours to do the luau  he did the strip club  move  holy shit  oh yeah we did  the strip club move  obviously you know  you watch someone  else's lap dance  yeah  Sam and Jeff  were like the locals  in Apocalypse Now  when they were 
[03:27:00]  watching the strippers  right over the bushes  we saw they were  talking about the  history of why  and what not  I bet you had to  turn all the way  around to see the  performances right  well we had to  look over the bushes  like tiptoes  it's like when you  park up the hill  to the drive-in  kind of watch the  movie  oh Sam's the  worst  you are  you are terrible  it's not too late  for you  well I mean it's  not  it's an illness  why don't you heed  our advice  because we had a  wonderful time  yeah but you're  doing the same  mistakes your dad  did to you 
[03:27:30]  yep  and the same  annoyance your mom  had  Jess is gonna  build up  Jess is fucking  smoking  obviously that  had something  I don't  Jess should be  treated like a  princess right  that's right  she's happy  she had a  wonderful time  she had a  satisfactory time  yeah she probably  did have a nice  time  but I guarantee  there was a couple  things that bugged  her  mistake number  I forgot  five or six  no lunch  for nine days  oh my god  yeah we had  heavy breakfast  and snacks  by the pool  snacks by the pool  and you guys 
[03:28:00]  aren't drinkers  so you saved  a lot of money  on the drink bill  yeah and they  gave us a free  bottle of champagne  or something like  oh did you sell it  you didn't drink it  no  well you don't drink  so I can't beat you  up for that  you know what we did  and this one was  Jess's idea  not my idea  this is a very smart  idea on her part  without a met  gentleman  you stay here  without separate  evenings  wow  just explore  individually  you stay here 
[03:28:30]  we knew we were  going to have snacks  because we planned  in advance  skipping lunches  sure  so  why were you  skipping lunches  were you really  doing that just to  save money  or were you guys  just busy  no no  you didn't skip lunch  to save money  no we knew going  we were bringing tears  to E-Rock's eyes  just saying skip lunch  I know  two things he hates  skipping and lunch  for the people that  didn't get it  skipping and missing lunch  we bought snacks  at the Walmart  after we left  the airport  before we got 
[03:29:00]  to the hotel  you went to a Walmart  in Hawaii  that's what honeymooners  do in Hawaii  fuck Sam  that way we don't  have to pay the  gift shop prices  late night condom run  is the only time  you would need that  and that's for  somebody that uses them  right  other than that  no reason to go to  a Walmart  what kind of snacks  did you buy  we had all kinds  of great stuff  we had Pringles  we had mini Oreos  but she doesn't eat  any of this stuff  some of the  no she was enjoying  the mini Oreos  native Hawaiian food  yeah exactly  have some poi  you jizzbucket  baked lays 
[03:29:30]  did you have any  pineapple  Jess enjoyed the  pineapple  I did not  I had my breakfast  every morning  was raisin bran  bacon and watermelon  watermelon  that one he can't help  of course  yeah  you are so glad  wow  every morning  pineapple  you didn't even try  fresh pineapple  in Hawaii  no  Jess said it was good  mistake number  what am I up to  17  I had fish and chips  though  for one meal  fresh fish 
[03:30:00]  you know  that's good in Hawaii  that's good  and I had to explain  to Jess  the battle  that runs through  my brain  as I'm chewing  the fish  knowing that my  taste buds  are enjoying it  but my brain  just keeps reminding  me that  I don't like fish  I don't like fish  I don't like fish  that's your OCD  wow  why don't you like fish  I don't know  I was eating it  and it tasted fine  so why  the texture wasn't  even bad  why say to yourself  I don't like fish  I wasn't doing it  it was my brain  involuntarily doing it  he's sick this dude  he's OCD  he's terrible  that kind of chronic  cheapness is OCD  and like your food 
[03:30:30]  stuff is all OCD  weird shit  but at least you ate  the fish and chips  do you feel like  you've accomplished  something when you  get to not pay  for something  you walk away  and just think about  it for a while  you're like  I really saved  some cash right there  when there's a good value  that's a feeling  of satisfaction  but not on your honeymoon  that's when you have  to kind of let your brain  go alright  shut the fuck up brain  I'm gonna do a few  little things here today  no there's no reason  that we can't feel  come home being like  look we had a great time  and we didn't even  spend that much money  this is like a twofer 
[03:31:00]  how much money did you save  did you figure it out  in the end  no not yet  we were exhausted  yesterday  but you will figure it  out in your head  I mean  we were  allocating  we figured it's gonna cost  it could cost like  a hundred dollars a night  for the two of us  to have dinner every night  yeah  no it did not  no it did not  so we saved some money there  what did you eat leaves  plus  we didn't do any zip lines  we didn't do any helicopters  I was gonna ask you  did you do anything  that was Hawaiian  do  we did  like we explored 
[03:31:30]  we went to villages  wait wait wait  you're not getting away  with that one  why not the zip lines  that sounds like  wow that would be  a cool thing to do  in Hawaii  well I didn't want to  anyway because I'm  afraid of heights  right  but we didn't do  any of the tourist stuff  yeah why do that  they didn't want to  spend money  they wanted to walk around  she tolerated it  because Sam did marry her  but believe me  there was a part of her  where she was like  ugh  business class would be nice  what this could have been  no  she's so close  to a good vacation  but she's at the place  she's at the place 
[03:32:00]  but then you just like  don't do anything  her whole vacation  was peeking over the bushes  like  instead of realizing  that you married  way out of your  out of your zone  you really did  you went to a much  higher level  that's fair  she tolerates  your wrestling nonsense  she tolerates  your dumb chair  that's signed  and going away  and allowing you  to decorate  you gotta  at times like that  you gotta spend  the extra 350  I'm telling you  that shit's gonna  creep up on you  that's where  you gotta spend it  right now  she's very happy  and I kept asking  you having a good time  she having a great time 
[03:32:30]  that means  you were scared  she wasn't having  a good time  because he knows  he's chiseling  when you're on  a good vacation  you never ask that  because you just  know it's happening  but it wasn't like  are you having a good time  it was like  isn't this great  of course  then what is she gonna go  no  we had desserts  every  almost every night  and I normally  wouldn't be like  let's go get dessert  a treat  why desserts  because we're on vacation  why not spend the extra money  on ice cream  it's great  how enchanting  both of them  with lactose farts 
[03:33:00]  two in the morning  there's lots of  shave ice places  so let's go get  a shaved ice  because that's pretty cheap  that's a cheap dessert  exactly  I told you  nine  it's a little local flavor  oh no it's not  this guy spent 22 grand  on his Hawaiian honeymoon  oh my god  he's a fucking idiot  why would you spend  22 grand  I'm not saying  you were supposed  to spend 22,000  no  probably for an extra grand  you probably would have  had a little better time  I wasn't spending  an extra grand  why not an extra grand  because a grand  is a lot  wow  it isn't 
[03:33:30]  that's why it's called grand  you do great things with it  grand  no it's great to have  oh no  to do what with them  to do what  what are you going to  spend it on  that's more important  you don't spend it  on a TV  because  Jess also  the reason Jess  doesn't mind this stuff  is because she is also  future minded  she's not so wrapped up  in the right now  really  was she getting a divorce lawyer  no but what's happening  and think about it  rationally  what's happening  in the future  that's so important  that like 
[03:34:00]  on your honeymoon  you wouldn't spend  $3.50 a seat  to upgrade  to a much better  class of service  like $3.50 plus $3.50  is $700  plus $2  that becomes $1,400  right  for again  this is not a trip  to Florida  or Chicago  this is as far  as you can fly  in the United States  possibly Alaska  might be the exception  what's more important  like what are you doing  that is  that $1,400  will make or break  five years from now  well I don't know 
[03:34:30]  if it's easy  it's just  it's  but think about it  that specific  cost wouldn't have done much  but we have you know  we're gonna eventually  have kids  we're gonna eventually  have a house  you're gonna be  skinflint with them  because the sickness  won't change  cheaply risen  raised kids  poorly reared idiots  poorly reared  yeah  this is  Opie and Anthony's  Worst of 2012  Worst of 2012  Opie and Anthony show  continuing on  with recapping  Sam's Hawaiian honeymoon  now if you've been listening 
[03:35:00]  Sam is not really  your typical dude  where you'd go  to an exotic location  you'd think  I'm gonna go to the beach  I'm gonna go check out  the volcanoes  maybe swim with some dolphins  Sam has other ideas  and maybe it's because  he doesn't like to spend  any money  Sam's Hawaiian honeymoon  part two  right now  this is ONA's Worst of 2012  on the Opie and Anthony channel  I can't comprehend  you go to Hawaii  granted 
[03:35:30]  you know  maybe not do all the things  we suggested here today  but like a volcano  who gets to see a volcano  you're that close  and you go  can we drive to a volcano  do we take a helicopter  how do we see the fucking volcano  we did  why wouldn't you see a volcano  we did the road to Hana  did you see a volcano  in the distance at least  yeah oh yeah  in the distance sure  it's all mountainous  the road to Hana stinks  no it doesn't  that's terrible  it's a road  exactly  fuck Hana  Jess got a little car sick  but  of course she did  she didn't actually throw up  but she felt nauseous  yeah you just feel like shit 
[03:36:00]  she probably felt that way  when she saw the room  when she realized  she was in coach  and she could have sat in business  when she said  I'm next to her  every night  when she was looking up  that dumb hairdo  over the pillow  right  I ain't tie my hair back  once when I was in Hawaii  wow you're a wild man  I think I speak for everyone  when you go to  like a new place  you think of the one thing  that you're gonna see there  that you're not gonna see  anywhere else  you do that  I get not doing the surf lesson  and the zip line I guess 
[03:36:30]  because you kind of  could do that stuff  elsewhere  but a volcano  you're never gonna have  that opportunity  did you go  go to the black sand beaches  we did go to one  black sand beach  yes  how was that  it was awesome  what's a black sand beach  just black sand  yeah but it's like  because it's volcanic  and we saw lava rocks  oh  we saw caves  that you could just swim in  and it was clear  but you saw them  did you swim in a cave  I like we didn't go swimming  you didn't go swimming  why  you're in Hawaii  you didn't even take a dip  in the water  to the cave  no in that specific cave 
[03:37:00]  why wouldn't you  swim in caves  Jess didn't want to  swim in a cave  we didn't swim in a cave  oh Jess didn't want to  why wouldn't she  swim in the caves  we were getting back in the car  we were doing some more  so that's what you say  I would've  how much would it cost  to have swimming in a cave  wait wait wait  you didn't hear what you just said  I would've  why didn't you  because if Jess doesn't want to  I don't want to spend  tell her to fucking get some sun  I'm gonna go check out the caves  look at this canyon  let me ask you a question Sam  would it have cost money  to swim in the caves  no  okay  why didn't you swim in the caves  maybe we didn't want to  we were on a tour  that we were guiding ourselves on 
[03:37:30]  oh boy  and  you chose not to go on  the guided tours either  no we got a GPS  how much is that  like 50 bucks a person  about  60 maybe  70 dollars a person  we had a GPS tour guide  that we just plugged in the car  with us  you didn't even take  a fucking  39 dollars a day  you didn't even take  one guided tour  for the  oh you returned it that day  one day  on the way back  we returned it  one day  he had his little GPS guide  you didn't do  one guided tour  I hate guided tours  you're in Hawaii though 
[03:38:00]  no I hate  we didn't want to do anything  where we had to go  with a bunch of other people  a bunch of tourists  we didn't want to have  any of the shitty  tour guides  that are just giving us  the run around  but you didn't do  anything  we went  logically you're explaining  every single one of these  but in the end  you didn't do anything  we went to the places  where the guided tours are  but we just drove there  but you didn't know  what was going on there  because no one was telling you  no  we knew what was going on  we went to like  all the little local  neighborhoods  did you like  go to any of these towns 
[03:38:30]  that maybe were wiped out  by  by lava  well we went to towns  they weren't wiped out  by lava  but they had lava rocks in them  I stood on a lava rock  there's a picture of me  which you were under one  begging for help  there's a picture of me  Tootsie's all hot  they weren't fresh lava rocks  there's a picture of me  standing on a lava rock  that's good for you  exactly  there should be a picture 
[03:39:00]  of you in front of  a fucking volcano  you're obsessed with  bubbling hot magma  coming up behind you  you should have melted  your sneakers  no  that'd be cool  you're obsessed with  seeing the top of a volcano  I don't know if I'd take  the helicopter ride  because I'm scared of  helicopters  that I might not do  right  but I would have at least  I would have done  you would have done something  oh yeah  we did do stuff  I don't know what you did  you didn't even have lunch  you didn't even have lunch  we didn't even have lunch  no  why wouldn't you  was she hungry during the day  no we had snacks  from Walmart  oh the Walmart snacks  I forgot about the Walmart snacks 
[03:39:30]  in Hawaii  yeah  holy fuck  I want to sit your dad down  your dad's a really nice guy  and go look at this  I want to just pull out his mustache  what are you doing  look what you did  look what you did  we went to  big kahuna burger  we went to Bubba's Burgers  that's that Hawaiian joint  in uh  in uh  isn't Bubba  that's like a  you can get that anywhere  no  no there's  well I mean there's probably  other Bubba's Burgers  but there's a franchise  it's in Kauai  and there's only three of them  but  they had a broken toilet seat 
[03:40:00]  signed by  Ozzy  that's kind of cool  see  should have bought it  it probably wasn't Ozzy  it was probably some drunk guy  yeah  we got to see all kinds  of crazy stuff  look at this  it's Ozzy  Makawahani  O-Z-Z-I-E  yes  he's an old  fucking  what's that shitty instrument  they play there  oh that stupid ukulele  the uke  we got to see stores  that just sold ukuleles  that's crazy  did you go see Don Ho 
[03:40:30]  no  is he dead  we saw a magic show  did you go see where they  filmed Hawaii Five-0  no  how about where they filmed Lost  no I don't care about Lost  or Jurassic Park  what's the matter with you  I don't do these movie tours  what's the matter with you  it's more universal  it's more than a movie tour  because it's an amazing waterfall  that you can't even walk to  you have to fucking be in the air to see  that's something cool  we drove around and saw waterfalls  on the road to Hana  and I usually don't do tourist trappy things  it sounds like you do  it does sound like I do Sam 
[03:41:00]  you're right  but you didn't do anything  let's look at your honeymoon photographs  there's only a couple of them  that I posted  but look at that  that's on top of the Waimea Canyon  what are we looking at  that's the canyon  that was what I was looking at  what is it  not too many filters on that  that's like Mars  know why he had to filter up his shit  because he wasn't going to the cool places  yeah that's just  so now he takes his boring photographs  and he fucking filters the shit out of them  that's terrible  why would you filter  why would you filter any pictures from Hawaii 
[03:41:30]  it's boring  throw filters on there  it's Hawaii  it should be beautiful naturally  yeah you don't need filters  you fucking hashtag no filter bitches  I thought Photoshop a volcano on that motherfucker  yeah but I liked  you just put no filter anyway  what are we looking at Sam  I'm getting really fucking pissed  the top of a canyon  but what is it  it's a canyon  what's down below  grass  there's grass down below  there's rocks  there's trees  we're up in the clouds  for God's sakes  we're way high  look at this view  yeah it looks like you're way high  in the clouds 
[03:42:00]  we take a picture from the clouds  alright next picture  I'm not impressed by your first one  oh you don't have to  you filter the shit out of it  yeah  let's see  that's terrible  look at this sunset  that's filtered  I do that every fucking day  yeah but not like that  that's better than your sunset picture  you filtered the shit out of it  yeah of course  that's the new shit  but if you're in Hawaii  I hear the sun's  you know sets  are just beyond amazing  they're great  so let's see the picture  without the filters  I didn't post it  oh that's a good one 
[03:42:30]  Sam is a cheapo dullard  look at this  just sitting by  it looks like a backdrop  yeah that's a nice view  just sitting by the pool  chilling  looking  you know what  we're looking at  you arrive at your hotel  and go  holy fuck  look at this view  right  alright  that's where you start  now what  you hang by the pool  for a while  you're on your honeymoon  you're relaxing  honeymoon pictures  yeah on the internet  I'm not sharing my honeymoon photos  with the  oh man  but you put  the world wide web  you put your best foot forward 
[03:43:00]  you put your best foot forward  what do I have to prove  to people  I don't have to prove  to Twitter followers  pictures that you had to  filter the shit out of  to make better  and the view from  your hotel  which is nice  look  yeah  that's all I posted  but that's what you get  when you fucking step off the plane  but this wasn't  this wasn't a vacation  of posting pictures  to impress people  why am I mad  that you didn't have  a fucking  better time  I had the greatest time ever  why are we mad  if this is how he wants to live  you go and you relax 
[03:43:30]  you spread aloha  aloha  you went to Walmart  you spread aloha  I wish that was Hawaiian  for your brains  all over the ceiling  with a gun  you went to Walmart  to get snacks  so you didn't even have  to eat lunch  that's crazy  well we had big breakfast  too  a lot of bacon  ah the big breakfast  the big breakfast  did you fucking put a little  in your swimsuit  on the way out  no but I should've  definitely should've  that was hurting right  you were bothered  by the fact  you couldn't grab  oh that he had  to leave food behind  you could have  a to-go box  you don't to-go 
[03:44:00]  you hit that buffet  on the way out  you grab whatever  the fuck you can  and just go  and you see where  that doorway is  I didn't do that  I was too busy  relaxing in Hawaii  oh  ran into a couple  listeners here and there  what  yeah  really  yeah  you could do that  that's true  I mean  sounds great  you ask people  who go to Kauai  you go  and you relax  how much did  that was the purpose  of the trip  how much did your honeymoon  cost to Hawaii  because people are saying  I spent 10 
[03:44:30]  12,000  it wasn't  we definitely kept it  significantly under 10,000  significantly  that means 5  I would hope  that that was the ballpark  it was probably about  6  between 6 and 7  maybe 6,500  you went to Hawaii  for 6,500  for a million days  I should be traveling  two people  amazing  holy shit  I think it was about that  fucking amazing  maybe 7,000  I think that's almost impossible  pretty good  yeah  in this day and age  you go and you relax 
[03:45:00]  you should write a book  about that  and it's called  how to put saving money  above all fun  no  if you spend 7,000  which might be high  half of that  would probably be  your hotel bill  or close to it  right  could be  I mean yeah  maybe not half  but you know  you should write a book  how to be a chiseler  look you go  and you relax  I work a lot  go to Hawaii  you don't do anything  no you do things  then you shouldn't  have picked Hawaii 
[03:45:30]  no that's the perfect  place to relax  Hawaii is the type  of place where  you really should  get out  and experience things  someone said  you should have  just gone to LA  and gotten a studio apartment  there you go  or I mean  you go to Miami  for that  you get a nice  little hotel room  close to a beach  and just chill out  by the way  why did you go  this time of year  like why this  why this month  I bet you the rooms  are cheaper  at the last week of August  I thought that the show  was going to be off  last week of August  oh okay  he did  no no he was  that's a good guess  he just assumed  absolutely  and he wanted to be  back when the show  was on 
[03:46:00]  that is responsible  I'm not saying  that Sam's not responsible  his issue is this  fucking money thing  holy fuck  very responsible  no but in your head  you're having a blast  that's why I think  we all get frustrated  Jess had a blast too  you just go and chill out  you spread aloha  she's too nice  to tell you  you know  that it sucked  you throw up the horns  the horns  you know  you wouldn't believe  we saved so  one night  we thought we were  going to spend  like $100 on dinner  no  we found like 
[03:46:30]  a little Mexican spot  that's like a hole  in the wall  called the crack  called Taco Bell  you're eating Mexican food  while you're in Hawaii  little local spots  that's local to everywhere  it was delicious  fresh food  I got two Mexican joints  within two blocks  of my place  yeah  they're nice  but you know  it's home  I don't know where  I could get Hawaiian food  in Manhattan  so if I'm in Hawaii  I'm like you know what  we're going to eat  so much fucking pineapple  it's going to be  coming out of our eyes  no there's like  nice fresh  what do you have 
[03:47:00]  ingredients  well I didn't  no I didn't go  at the crack  then we went to  Bubba's Burgers  and I got chicken sandwich  why not at least  eat in nice restaurants  we ate at a nice restaurant  we did a nice mixture  some nights we had  a nice restaurant  wait you didn't eat  at the Mexican joint  no because it was like  it was a hole in the wall  there was no place  to sit down  so who ate there  Jess ordered food there  and then we went  and ordered  like there was not  the place had no tables  she got it to go  there was no tables  it was only to go  she got Mexican food  to go  I don't know  honey  I can't wait 
[03:47:30]  until you come in  frowning  she called a lawyer  Sam  that's what she wanted  no  and  I don't know why  it frustrates me  because it's your life  but man  and what did you get  on the chicken sandwich  did you at least  at least have it  where it felt Hawaiian  I did this Hawaiian thing  where they put lettuce  and tomato on it  wow  yeah so  where am I gonna  I don't put anything  on sandwiches  where am I gonna put  pineapple sauce  Mexican food to go  on our Hawaiian honeymoon  we were all hoping 
[03:48:00]  to live through you  because we didn't do  anything for our summer break  it was fucking awesome  you guys would have had a blast  I went to a couple concerts  and you had this fucking  you know  you would have loved it  that's how sweet  I would have  but even if I had no money  I would have done  way more than you did  no you would have relaxed  what do you do  you go to the Outer Banks  for two weeks  and you just sit on a beach  you relax  yeah because  see the difference is  yeah I get  going to a place  and just doing nothing  that's why you pick  somewhere like the Outer Banks  where you're on a  four by four beach  you drive out to your house 
[03:48:30]  and that's it  you don't really go back to town  maybe once  what about Kauai  yes I get the  I get where you just  fucking settle in  but you don't settle in  in Hawaii  yeah you do  you don't settle in  in Hawaii  but you  it sounds like  you should have done  Miami for your honeymoon  no you go to Hawaii  it's so much nicer  than Miami  how do you know  I've been to Miami  you don't even know  I've been to Miami  no for Hawaii  we saw your three  I encourage everyone 
[03:49:00]  to go to your Instagram  to see the three sad pictures  you posted  first of all  they're beautiful  with a lot of filters  it's not Sam on Instagram  they're beautiful pictures  do you realize  with Instagram  as soon as you start  fucking around with filters  you know your shot is shitty  so you're trying to  fucking pump it up  it's a shitty shot  pump it up a little  that's the new shit  is to way go crazy  with filters  not when you're in Hawaii  that's right  you're going to go round  and round with this shit  no the new shit  is to just load it up  with as many filters  as you can  if you're stupid rolling  taking a picture of  the skyline  for the 10,000th time 
[03:49:30]  I get it  you throw a filter on it  not when you're in Hawaii  you load that shit up  well Lyndon is dumbass  pictures of the skyline  we get it  every night  plus I would just  post them like  from airports  while I was waiting  on planes  so you just  play with the filters  while you're waiting  for your plane  the plane from  it was a little  risky  the plane from  Maui to Kauai  that was not a good plane  why?  it was a propeller plane  that happens on an island 
[03:50:00]  that's puddle jumpers  and they had to  seat us  accordingly to weight distribution  that's understandable  they do that  when you're just  flying up to  Buffalo  never been on a prop plane?  no I don't think so  how long of a flight was it?  it was only 45 minutes  yeah that's what they do  on the  what do you want  a fucking 767  to go 45 minutes?  did you wonder  the whole time  if that screw  was going to hold  on the propeller?  yeah  that's what I wonder  the propeller screw  it's not a new plane  that's what I always wonder  that one dumb  fucking screw  or whatever  it fucking is 
[03:50:30]  right  yeah it's real loud  yeah  and I tried to  I was comforting  I was really comforting myself  but I pretended I was  comforting Jess  because she was like  oh this is an old plane  and I said  Jess  this is a little bit  of an old plane  but you know what that means  and she goes  what?  and I went  lots of successful journeys  she said that?  I did  lots of successful journeys  really put her at ease  sure  as it should have  I wish that was a quote  from seconds from disaster  I love that show  exactly  so what was the 
[03:51:00]  wow moment?  the one big thing  that you did in Hawaii  well there was  it was either  driving up to the canyon  or driving the road to Hana  the road to Hana  is an attraction  but we learned  the road to Hana  just ends  well yeah  it's like shit  that doesn't sound  fun driving  and what is in Hana again?  it's a lot of fun  listen  well you guys need  to understand it  what is in Hana  sometimes the destination  is the journey  it's the road to Hana  if they're saying  it's the road to Hana 
[03:51:30]  that means there's  some temple there  or something  no it's just like  it's just like  a little town  just like beaches  and stuff  that's like if a Hawaiian  guy came here  with his fucking  newlywed  and was like  I took the  Long Island Expressway  and we went to  Yapank  the road to Hana  the road to Yapank  and then we turned around  and drove back  this thing has like  60  no  it has like  60 something  one lane bridges  it has over  600 curves  and winds 
[03:52:00]  and stuff  that's why she got  carsick  you're driving up  a mountain  yeah that's why  she got carsick  the views are the  sickest thing you've  ever seen in your life  apparently so  she was in a vomit  not like that  like slang  you could have drove  the sawmill  it's not the same  as the sawmill  they have a lot of  twists and turns though  she could have got  fucking carsick  on the sawmill  the views are  re-dick  obviously  pictures  that you had to  filter the shit out of  I didn't post the pictures  on the lousy three pictures  you posted  you know why I didn't  post the pictures  that's what Jess was saying 
[03:52:30]  you dick  oh re-dick  this wasn't  this wasn't a vacation  for Sam and the  Opie and Anthony show  this was Sam and Jess  you know better  when you're in the public eye  you're like okay  here's my personal pictures  and I'm gonna fucking  make sure I do some  rock star pictures  for everybody else  that's right  every time I posted a picture  I posted three pictures  over the course of nine days  and every time people  are going  get the fuck off Twitter  you're in Hawaii  enjoy yourself  it's like I was trying  to share with you guys  come on  they were just mad  that you didn't have  much to offer 
[03:53:00]  exactly  you were clogging up  their timeline  with your shit  yeah cause the other thing  is a lot of people  listening to us right now  will never get to go to Hawaii  so they were living through you  and you give them  three shitty pictures  with horrible filters on them  scenic views  that's beautiful  did you see a palm tree  at least  and what do you think  those long sticks are  because you don't even  put the palm trees  in your picture  there's palms  at the end of them  there's palm trees  all over the place  you know  did you have coconut  I had  I think I did 
[03:53:30]  he doesn't even know  did you at least drink  something with an umbrella  in it  beverage  did you at least have  a glass of cum  with an umbrella  drink alcohol  why does this bother me  so much  why does it bother  all of us  because you know  that all he's doing  is justifying his illness  and is that what it is  yes  because you can see through  like even though  he's logically a smart guy  you understand that  underneath it  is a horrible cheapness  and it's an ugly thing  to see  you're really good  at explaining yourself  but I wonder if  like you wish  you were having  a little more fun  I wonder 
[03:54:00]  I had talked about  the cheap restaurants  we also went to  tonight's restaurants  we had one where  like just for dessert  this was after the meal  this was bonus  and I said  you know what  what do you mean bonus  because you found a place  where it was like  a price fixed  no  did you go to those  price fixed menu places  desserts included  no  this is me saying  but you allowed her  to order off  the dessert choice  they had  where they had to say  well that's gonna be  seven dollars more  this is a quote from me  she said  why don't we just get  something to split  and I said 
[03:54:30]  Jess  just get something  for yourself  and only have  a couple bites  she had  she had  creme brulee  out of a coconut  while we watched  koi fish swimming  under us  this is amazing  they were eating  better than you  why were they  koi fish  were they batting  their eyes  or something  there were penguins  in the lobby  of the hotel in Maui  that's disrespectful  Jesus Christ  yeah  that's good 
[03:55:00]  that's all free  entertainment  yeah it is  yeah it is  I was talking  to the parrots  aloha  I don't know  is that what they said  yeah  and one of the parrots  cheap cunt  chiseler  chiseler  one of the parrots  in Hawaii  started talking to me  because on the sign  it said he loves  the theme song  from Hawaii Five-0  so in the middle  of the hotel  I started humming  doo doo doo  doo doo  and the parrot  responded  accordingly  he sang along 
[03:55:30]  no he just started  clicking at me  what a fucking  man  it was great  it was great  sounds like a  fucking bore fest  sounds terrible  it really sounds  you go to relax  you just go to relax  we're going around  in circles now  you had a shitty honeymoon  there was nothing  shitty about it  you guys are very  negative people  we are negative people  Sam you're right  but you made it  very easy today  and if you guys  had come with me  which I wish you had  we all would have  had fun  next time 
[03:56:00]  we'll all go  on a trip  together  because we would  have paid for  everything  that would have  been nice  I'm not picking up  any tabs  I wish Oprah  were here  they would have  picked up this  bill and not  even thought  about it  you guys would  have made me  go to someplace  nicer  oh yeah  come to bill  what are you  doing this  poor girl  she's nice  she must be  starving at this  point  for everything  they had cabanas 
[03:56:30]  in Kauai  yeah  we didn't get  no  they also had  more importantly  umbrellas  which are free  cabanas are not  oh my god  well I'm glad  you got an umbrella  I bet you if you  had to pay for them  you certainly would  have saved on the  umbrella  you know what we  would have done  get in the water  how much are the  cabanas  I don't know  we didn't even  check  you didn't even  check  I heard how much  yours was in  Vegas  well they are  a little expensive  that's something  where I would  that could be  very expensive  but he could have  checked  doesn't it hurt 
[03:57:00]  to check  no check  he just knew  he just knew  imagine that  $10 a day  there's no way  son of a bitch  plus Jess wanted  to relax too  one day you get  a cabana  you and Jess  are in there  nice and romantic  we spent the  whole day by the  pool  under umbrella  you got Mexican  food in Hawaii  it was delicious  and fresh  according to Jess  I didn't have  any  what a dick  you guys would  have had a blast  it was about  relaxing  I wanted to 
[03:57:30]  relax  Jess wanted to  relax  you didn't try  the local food  you didn't try  we did try  the local food  we didn't try  any of the  tourist traps  that you wanted  to go on  I didn't go  you wouldn't  but you wanted  to  why don't you  go take a  surfing lesson  and have some  guy pretend  to talk Hawaiian  and take you  on a tour  with a bunch  of other idiots  that are all  you know  old people  in Bermuda  shorts  my next trip  is wide now  I'm obsessed  now  I have to go  I have to go  just to see  what Sam is  you know what  we were doing  we saw the 
[03:58:00]  vans full of  people on the  road to Hana  first of all  the road to Hana  would have taken  nine hours  to go with a  tour  the road to Hana  stinks  fuck that road to Hana  I hate it  look it up  for yourselves  okay  it's an attraction  you know what  you should look  it up too  because I  don't think  you really  saw it  we did  see it  and  they would have  taken nine  hours  on one of  those guided tours  just his hair  away from her  mouth  so she didn't  get a vomit  on it  no  jesus  oh sick  because they 
[03:58:30]  stop at  everything  we drove  right past  those dumb  buses  where opie  would have  been like  oh great  another tree  while I'm  hanging out  with all the  other fat  tourists  oh man  nah  I'll jump  on some  of that  dumb  shit  yeah  it's a waste  of time  you could do  it yourself  and it's funner  it's called  life experiences  I love how he  tries to talk  us all into it  like he was  you know  he's half right  in that he wanted  to do certain  things  but he understands  deep down  that he is  covering up  his chronic  illness  which is 
[03:59:00]  horrible OCD  which is his  cheapness  is part of  his OCD  and I know  on some level  you know that  I don't think  the cheapness  is as bad  as the food  though  so  but again  it doesn't  matter  just because  one isn't  as bad  as the other  doesn't mean  that it's  not bad  you should have  done something  and you hated  when your dad  did it  and Jess is  going to feel  exactly what  your mother did  no because  I pump that  AC when I  get home  my dad  never liked  the AC  yeah that's  true  but again  that's your  big concession  pump that  AC  rock the TV  till the end  but if I see  a wrestling figure 
[03:59:30]  I want to get  no problemo  exactly  you spend money  on that  right  yeah  do you get  all mad  looking at  the electric  bill going  like oh  boy the  fucking  there's the  beauty of it  I spent  three hulks  and a fucking  Mr. Mistego  whatever these  fucking assholes  names are  here's the beauty  of it  I take care of  cable and internet  Jess takes care of  electric  busted  not even power  no that's the  problem  oh that's the issue  yeah  sorry  power supplies  all busted  I don't have to  worry about the 
[04:00:00]  electric  sounds like you had  a wonderful  fucking honeymoon  yeah  it was great  it was relaxing  good for you  it's good to get away  chill out  sure  at least you're  here today  is the radio  wizard here yet  I don't know  yeah  I don't know  for sure  I wonder who  is listening  I am so mad  right now  why  at you  why  your first night  in Hawaii  you had a basement  hotel room  we got 
[04:00:30]  all we did  was  who gets  101 ever  we went  we got a snack  and we went  to sleep  we were exhausted  someone's saying  I should go on  vacation with Sam  no because  guess who  will pay for  everything  and not be  appreciative  I will be  appreciative  you would be  appreciative at least  but you will be  paying for everything  did you text  people on the show  no  just  one  I was left  alone  which was nice  to just leave me  alone  sure  except for one  text I got  while I was in  Hawaii 
[04:01:00]  I wonder who  it was from  it was from  Edgar  Edgar  oh is that  why you're asking  what did Edgar  say  it wasn't even  the end  it was like  Friday  and I wasn't  flying back  until Sunday  night  and Edgar  just texted  me  in Edgar  speak  letting me  know that  my vacation  was over  get back  to work  and do  your duty  wow  and I showed  it to Jess  and she goes  oh and I  said that's  Edgar  and she goes  how do you  know that's  Edgar  and I go 
[04:01:30]  well because  he types  phonetically  do you know  how happy I am  that they had  to have this  talk  how to talk  about Edgar  on their honeymoon  and she goes  she goes  well how do you  know that's  not Chip  I was like  Chip doesn't  talk like that  yeah  yeah we all  know that  what's wrong  with you Jess  give me your  number I'll text  you as Edgar  no  no  no  alright can we  go to break  any romantic  shenanigans  like anything  that was out of  the ordinary  yeah  no I mean  not just in the  dumb hotel bed  yeah  no I mean  there was intimacy  on most of the 
[04:02:00]  evenings for sure  how about this  in the pool  or anything  did you have  sex outdoors  no  no it was all  oh my god  what are you  doing  you talk dirty  no more than usual  we've had this  conversation before  I thought I made  your honeymoon  you might  you might have  said something  different  yeah  no it was  all uh  you know  with lights on  or off  on  on  oh okay  I like on  I prefer off  why  I have body image  shame  I just 
[04:02:30]  I ignore my  horrible body  and say she's  got to deal  with it  just look at  what's going  on  yeah  looking at  hers  would probably  be great  but yeah  yeah I  understand  there was  plenty of  intimacy  on those  Hawaiian nights  on the road  to Hana  how do you  know they  were Hawaiian  nights  you were in  a basement  that was  one night  I'm so mad  right now  that was  when we first  got there  did you  bang her  look it out  the window  at the  construction  workers  feet  alright you  keep saying  you only had  the basement  apartment  you only had 
[04:03:00]  the basement  apartment  one night  in Hawaii  right  what were you  looking at  for the rest  of the time  I told you  we had nice  mountains to  look at  oh you saw  the mountains  from behind  there  the hotel  so you  either had  mountain views  or an ocean  view type  of thing  there was  ocean view  mountain view  and resort  view  which we had  mountain view  not resort view  you sure  or did you  have partial  mountain view  where you had  to kind of  like move  your neck  all the way  around the corner  you gotta hang  out over the  balcony  and turn  your head  and go  yeah  mountain view  I looked out  my window

[04:10:00]  not  talking  today  i think  i made  that  clear  well you  could  just  talk  on  your  way  out  i mean  you gotta  walk  to  the  elevator  why not  have  a little  conversation  tell  jimmy  he's  his name  is almost  on the  wall  no his  name  is  not  on  the  wall  that's  right  after  all  these  years  we're  gonna  sketch  it  in  somewhere  anthony  he snuck  out  to be  fair  to gary  anthony  snuck  out  that's  true  gary 
[04:10:30]  likes  you  anthony  snuck  out  gary  didn't  see  him  you do  i don't  mind  him  you do  not  treat  him  well  whatever  i don't  treat  my own  mom  well  well  you have  a history  with her  roland  find out  what's  going  on  okay  roland  is  cutting  into  my  gym  time  you  and  jim  are  so  what  are  you  gonna  do  i mean  you  take  a  commercial  break  and  he's  coming  in  here  plus 
[04:11:00]  that  we  can't  document  it  so  i'd  prefer  you  did  not  you  taking  photos  of  me  jim  always  i like  that  gary  is  still  outside  i believe  he's  still  outside  roland  is  chatting  it  up  with  the  talent  intern  i don't  know  what's  gonna  happen  i think  roland  is  making  sure  that  jim  norton  is  taken  care  of  with  the  sally  field  photo  1045 
[04:11:30]  did i get  your picture  until 1045  oh  jim  are you gonna stick around for that  yeah  who you calling  it's like i  i would have just walked out and got her when she came in  yeah of course  who you calling  my agent  tell my agent i refuse to meet with this guy  is that right  looks like he's uh in the opie school of thought as far as taking your calls go  yeah i don't need an explanation just fucking make sure it doesn't happen again 
[04:12:00]  yeah open the door  is he still out there  i'm fucking 45  gary  yeah i don't need an explanation just make sure it doesn't happen again  thank you  jesus christ that's disrespectful  roll and let the door go  i'm glad i was standing by this microphone  because that is some disrespectful shit  he let the door go in gary's face  the guy is just trying to do a job  he's trying to manage the channel  i don't know i just follow the cues 
[04:12:30]  the on air light is now tilted  because opie slammed the door  and it's tilted over  jim  who's a celebrity  has to sit here for another 40 minutes  just for a picture with goofy sally field  i'm just like i just  i would just put  i go out there when they walk in it takes two seconds  i take a quick one and i'm done  but that's why i don't  i do it when they come in  so i don't have to wait 45 minutes to an hour  because they have press  of course  who are we calling  none of your business  it is my business 
[04:13:00]  why  because mind your own business  okay jim is going out  look jimmy gets to walk right by  and and gary doesn't follow him  why does he have to follow me every day  i hate to tell you something  there's two people whose names are on this empire  and you're one of them  you're 50%  your call has been for me  who was that that didn't pick up  who didn't pick up  what are you going to do  opie what's your move  tell him to tell you  and then you tell me  telephone  yes  tell him 
[04:13:30]  what are you doing  you gotta go tell him  say opie says  that i need to get the message  what's the explanation  we're wasting valuable air time  and it's mine too  so you know it's valuable  what's the explanation  i'll catch up with you off the air  he's gonna catch up with you off the air  no he's not  we're gonna see  i hope gary doesn't quit  i want gary to win this one 
[04:14:00]  there's nothing to win  yes there is something to win  how can you explain  that the contest fell through  the fucking cracks today  oopsie  how are you gonna explain that  i don't believe it did  he doesn't think it did  we haven't played new entry  since wednesday  it's monday  this is  the  irresistible force  versus the immovable object  is it really  oh yeah  is it really  you won't leave the studio  he's not leaving the hallway 
[04:14:30]  my money's on gary  to win this one  i think you're gonna be  out of this studio  before he's out of the hallway  and then you know  what's gonna happen  he's gonna get that 120 seconds  that he so desires  and deserves  quite frankly  you got a footprint  on the bottom of your shoe  it's very childlike  opi radio on twitter  not sam on twitter  opi radio on instagram  not sam on instagram  opi radio on youtube  not sam on youtube  and unfortunately  i didn't get opi radio 
[04:15:00]  for facebook  so it's opi radio fans  i got prime time  sam roberts on facebook  eric how you doing  in there buddy  i'm good  he's out there  somewhere laughing  he is  he's cracking up  of course he is  how did he escape  this shit  because he snuck out  well i gotta learn  from him  you snuck out  before  this time  you were slow  and guess what happens  it's 10.50 now  what happened  the bird gets the word  10.50 on the 
[04:15:30]  sally field picture  jimmy's gonna lose  his mind  i know but  sometimes when a guest  comes i can't control  10.50  what's she doing  what show is she doing  bob edwards you said  jimmy has to wait  because she's talking  to bob edwards  we gotta tell him  that's gonna drive him  nuts  what she's just  in a studio by herself  so go in and take  the picture  while she's  well bob edwards  is asking one of  those dumb long questions  it's taped anyway  isn't it  who you calling  your agent still  now i'm calling  anthony  to find out 
[04:16:00]  how he got away  it's 10.50 now  jimmy  and she's talking  to bob edwards  go walk right in  there  he's on an  isdn  he'll never even  know  no i know  but uh  you know  how does she look  she looks really good  actually i just saw  her through the glass  she looks very good  i mean considering  she was in  she was old  in forrest gump  is gary still outside  she looks really old  in spider-man  does she  but i think they threw  a little of that  makeup on her too though 
[04:16:30]  is she supposed to be  aunt may  is that the role she  plays in spider-man  rolling  yeah  yep  what are you gonna do  well what i'm gonna do  is i'm walking out of  the studio with a video  camera on and i'm gonna  just film him  that's a good move  and i'm gonna post it  so it's up to him  are you gonna tell him  that you're videoing  with the intention to post  before he speaks  go tell him  just say obi will be  documenting his trip  to the elevator  via video 
[04:17:00]  did you hear roland  mumbling that  why does he get so  nervous  yeah obi said he  could uh video  watch out youtube  gary explain on the  show  did he actually  gary  just come in and talk  like a gentleman  be happy to talk to you  off the air  you can't complain about  things not working if  you can't have a  conversation about it 
[04:17:30]  not every conversation  should be on air  all of it should be on  air jimmy  face  i don't want to take a  lot of your time  two minutes we're done  i think i think most of  it should be on the air  unless you're talking  about a guy's money or  something you know what  i mean like like how  much you make sure  what happened with the  contest  he nailed you opi  your your point  boom  boom  well that then we're  not talking  what up yo  dude how did you  escape this shit  what happened  oh you're not  listening to sam  i'm stuck in the 
[04:18:00]  studio  oh how'd you get  stuck in the studio  he's trapped  i'm trapped because  gary's waiting for me  to discuss  what we were talking  about and and  somehow you walked  right by him  i went uh  which i went to the  left outside of the  studio  and now he's just  sitting out there on  his blackberry refuses  to come on the air and  discuss it  and jimmy's pissed  because he can't get  a sally field picture  until 10 50  it's just 
[04:18:30]  it takes two seconds  i love when they say  she's running late  right  like they like when  she's running it's  like but i'm not i  don't want to talk to  her  can't somebody get  him going somewhere  else  oh no no no  he's right outside  the studio  what about this  what about this  no no no for the  people that i'm  doing this for the  fucking radio show  trust me i'm walking  right by him  what about this  trust me and you  can be my witness  sam  whatever  you have to do  it before the show  ends  because he doesn't  want to come on  the air  here's what i said  what what is your 
[04:19:00]  angle on the he  doesn't think that  the uh the contest  uh got fucked up  i'm like okay so  what's your point  oh i i'll only tell  you off air  what the fuck why  because not everything  should be on the air  here's what you do  i got a great plan  i got a great plan  you know how  e-rock  it would just  babble on and on  about something  that doesn't matter  go send e-rock  to ask gary a  question about the  worst of or  something and  while e-rock  is just consuming  time 
[04:19:30]  you just walk  right out  no sam that's  the pussy way to  do it  you watch how i  do it  what's your plan  my plan is to  go home  i did this for the  radio to have a  little fun but now  watch what i do  you're gonna walk  directly past him  totally  are you gonna  video it  no i don't need  to video it  wow  can i document it  you know for the  radio yeah of course  okay  all right you're
