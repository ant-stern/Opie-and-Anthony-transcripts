<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of Joe Frazier's death, punctuated by humorous and offensive anecdotes about his career and a Miller Lite commercial.  Audio clips of a previous Frazier interview were played.  This transitioned into a lengthy and highly critical, often vulgar, discussion of the Penn State child sex abuse scandal involving Jerry Sandusky and Joe Paterno.  The hosts and numerous callers debated the details of the allegations, Sandusky’s book "Touched," the potential cover-up, and the appropriate punishment, including the death penalty.

The show then shifted its focus to intern Matt, with co-host Sal leading a vehement and vulgar critique of Matt’s hygiene (described as "reeking," requiring chair wipes after he left), work ethic, and personality.  Specific accusations included infrequent showering, lack of deodorant, sleeping on the job, poor work habits, aggressive behavior towards Sal, and creepy behavior toward a female coworker.  This segment also featured criticism of various radio commercials (McRib, Geico) and included contributions from other staff members like Troy and E-Rock, along with the use of numerous nicknames for staff and past interns (Love Buzz, Cream Pie Jones, Intern David, "sex man").  A humorous bit featuring "Uncle Paul" concluded this segment.

Next, Opie and Anthony engaged in a highly explicit and profane conversation about their past relationships and ex-wives.  Opie detailed his ex-wife's nagging, refusal to do chores, and soap opera obsession, while Anthony described his ex-wife's emotional volatility, openness to other women, and accounts of various simultaneous sexual encounters, including a near-drunk driving incident with two women, one of whom was his wife. He also recounted a story about attempting to negotiate a threesome with a picture of another woman.  A former Club Med trapeze instructor called in briefly.  The conversation touched upon the difficulties of leaving long-term relationships and the humor found (by them) in their past experiences.

The broadcast then covered the Herman Cain sexual harassment allegations, with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton expressing skepticism and ridicule towards the accuser and Gloria Allred using highly offensive and misogynistic language.  This was followed by an interview with Armie Hammer promoting *J. Edgar*.  Hammer discussed working with Leonardo DiCaprio and Clint Eastwood, the film's portrayal of Hoover and Tolson's relationship,  and his own roles in *The Lone Ranger* and *Mirror Mirror*.  The conversation included anecdotes about the film's prosthetics, a fight scene, and Hammer's on-screen kisses with DiCaprio and Nina Hartley.  Vulgar and sexually suggestive language was used throughout the interview.  A separate segment featured a continuation of the Armie Hammer interview, beginning with a humorous anecdote about an awkward planned on-screen kiss.  Hammer described his research for the role, including revealing photos of Clyde Tolson, discussed Hoover’s personality and relationships, and then unexpectedly detailed his enthusiasm for firearms, including a personal anecdote about a near-stabbing incident.

The show concluded with the "After Opie and Anthony Live" segment, focusing on Anthony Cumia’s anxious anticipation of his *Call of Duty* game delivery, interspersed with playful banter with the staff, particularly Roland, and suggestive speculation about same-sex kisses with various celebrities.

Finally, a segment featuring Sam Roberts’s claim that Andy Samberg stole his Chris Humphrey impression for Saturday Night Live was broadcast. Roberts played his impression and jokingly demanded an apology or acknowledgment.  The conversation included Roberts’s "celebrity shit list" (featuring Andy Samberg and Guy Fieri), a discussion about the health of boxers (prompted by Frazier's death), and a humorous exchange about intern Matt, including a purported call from Bobo.  The segment also included promotional mentions of Trojan condoms, Argentium silver, and Steven Singer Jewelers, and news about *J. Edgar*.  Numerous fart jokes and other crude humor were present throughout.

[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up.  And Anthony. 
[00:04:00]  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening.  I don't even like an R opening.  I don't even like an R opening.  It sounds like a little...  What?  He's the dang open and I don't listen to the dang open.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah.  Full of palaver.  Lots of palaver.  Just enough. 
[00:04:30]  Just enough where you sit back and you feel full of palaver, but not too full.  Where you can't function for the day.  Hi, everyone.  Morning.  I've got to set some ground rules with people.  They're just dumb.  Fucking, you know, my triumphant return to Twitter every so often when I feel so inclined  to tweet, because I've kind of been off the Twitter for a while.  Yeah.  And I come back and tell a little joke. 
[00:05:00]  And, you know, all right.  Granted, it's not the be-all, end-all joke.  But it's a line.  It's a good line.  It's a line that has to do with, you know, Joe Frazier.  And people are like, really, Chip?  And it's like, people don't know when to do the Chip thing.  There's fucking morons.  They're just fucking idiots.  If it's any joke whatsoever, it's not Chip. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  So even if it's a partial joke.  I said, Joe Frazier's dead.  I hear Muhammad Ali's a little shaken up about it.  That's funny.  Yeah.  Of course it's funny.  It's a joke.  Now, whether it's a good one, a bad one, clever, punny, whatever.  It's a real joke.  Yeah, it's funny.  Chip would be, hey, Joe Frazier's dead.  It's like he's boxing or something.  That's fucking, yes, you would, Chip.  No, I wouldn't.  And then you go, because if there's any inkling of a joke, it's not Chip.  So these idiots would just like, really, Chip? 
[00:06:00]  They don't understand how Chip works.  Just block them.  It's infuriating.  I've been blocking Chip for months, and it's freeing.  Oh, I do.  I do.  It's freeing.  I do.  Because they're idiots.  I would have said, smoking Joe, what's he smoking a bunch of hams or something?  There you go.  See?  That's Chip.  See?  It makes no sense.  It has nothing to do with anything.  There you go.  Muhammad Ali's shaking because of Parkinson's.  What happens?  And he's shaking up because Joe Frazier's dead.  It's a two thing. 
[00:06:30]  All right.  I get that sometimes, too.  You do a joke that someone doesn't like.  They don't know what to do with it.  They just say, good.  It's really.  I've gotten Chip when it's not supposed to be Chip.  But they think you're throwing a Chip joke out there.  It's like, no.  And I have to say, no, ass.  It's a joke.  That's not a Chip joke, ass.  You never want to have to say that.  No, ass.  It's a joke.  Yeah.  Some guy goes, you forgot the tz-ts.  No.  That's just a dummy that doesn't understand comedy at all.  Oh, what an idiot.  Fucking assholes. 
[00:07:00]  Like I said, it's a quick pun that I tweeted.  Not the best ever line ever.  That's funny, dude.  But let me tell you something.  It's a good line.  Stop.  It ain't no chip line, motherfucker.  Yeah.  You don't block chips yet?  No, I don't.  You gotta block chips.  What's that?  I block Bobo's, and Bobo's don't appear on my fucking timeline anymore.  I don't get Bobo tweets, and my chip tweets are way the fuck down.  It's not close.  Way the fuck down.  Sounds like it's close to a chip.  It's not.  It's not.  Because it's a joke.  It's a joke. 
[00:07:30]  Adam from London.  You cock.  Idiots.  It's a joke.  You can't use our shit against us, either.  You can't have chip when there's even a part of a joke.  Chip does things that aren't jokes.  You folks fell on your face.  Holy shit.  You're making me so happy.  Oh, I know.  I know.  Well, you've created this monster.  Thanks.  Thanks for bringing that to everyone's attention.  Fucking assholes. 
[00:08:00]  Fucking assholes.  A good sister.  Asshole.  Oh.  Well, we lost good old Joe Frazier.  Down goes Frazier.  Down goes Frazier.  Down goes Frazier.  See, that's the clip the news should be playing today, but for some reason they're scared to  go there.  But that is the most famous fucking Joe Frazier clip right there.  As they're cranking that casket down into the hole.  Down goes Frazier.  Down goes Frazier.  Down goes Frazier. 
[00:08:30]  10-10 wins had a clip of somebody calling the alley, Frazier fight from Madison Square  Garden, 1971, when Frazier knocked down Ali, and it was the most boring boxing call ever.  You couldn't hear it.  Oh, you heard it, too, on the way in, right?  I'm like, why are you playing this?  It sucked.  Everyone knows.  Down goes Frazier.  Down goes Frazier.  Down goes Frazier.  I mean, that was it for Frazier.  That's the big famous clip right there. 
[00:09:00]  What a great call.  So what happened?  Fucking Frazier dies of the liver cancer.  Boy, he sure didn't have that.  I said days.  Had a run.  I said days.  You asked me flat out at the end of yesterday's show, how long does Frazier got?  I said days.  And it turned out to be hours.  That liver cancer, I guess.  Going by the book, hours would seem like days.  Oh, I like that.  What's that?  Can we get that commercial, the Miller Lite, when he was singing, snapping? 
[00:09:30]  I don't remember that one.  When you order a beer, do like smoking jobs.  Order a live beer from Miller.  This ain't no more.  It's got the third less cowers than the regular beer.  Life tastes great, y'all can listen here.  It's not the thing that makes me shout.  Life's less feeling.  Hey, that really knocks me out.  Yeah, it certainly did.  Light beer from Miller.  Everything you want.  Light beer from Miller. 
[00:10:00]  Light beer from Miller.  Do we have a...  That guy's voice was great.  We have a clip of what Joe Frazier sounded like a mere two years ago.  I can't believe it's two fucking years ago he was in here.  Was that long ago?  June 2009.  It seems like he was just here.  Oh, look at the clips of him.  What a fucking fun guy to watch.  Fun guy to watch?  Oh, and he boxed, man.  He just ducked down.  And he just fucking clots Ali.  Ali's shaking his head.  Nope, nope.  He was shaking.  But Ali hit like a fucking truck, man.  Ali won two out of the three. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, but that second one.  Lost the first one.  There he goes.  Ali was on the fucking canvas there.  He should have lost two out of three, actually, to Frazier.  But that one last...  That thriller in Manila.  That was heartbreaking for Frazier.  Yeah, he never got over that.  These guys, watching them fight was fucking...  That is some classic shit right there.  Oh, good old Warner Waltz.  Warner Waltz is going to talk about it on the Imus.  Imus. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, he's...  What do you got, E-Rock, from his appearance?  I pulled about a minute and a half of him talking about Ali, but he breaks...  Again, he breaks into song at one point, but he goes right back into talking to Ali again.  All right, let's hear it, man.  This is from June 2009.  I can't believe that.  That's two years ago.  I can't fucking...  Hit it.  Three fights.  The first one, Frazier won.  No, I won all three of them.  I think so. 
[00:11:30]  I think so.  I'm sorry, but stop being right there.  No, I won all three of them.  You know what I mean?  You can look at him now.  We had three fights, you know.  I'm walking.  I'm talking.  You know what I mean?  And he ain't nothing but a hound dog.  We're walking all the time.  So I'm enjoying life.  You're enjoying life, and Ali is pretty much in his own little...  So that's what you mean by you winning all three fights.  And the main thing about it was it wasn't you and I, you know what I mean? 
[00:12:00]  You look back at the things he said as time went by, you know, like...  I'm not making anything up.  I am the greatest.  I am the prettiest.  I am the fastest.  You see?  Now, you can't be no thee.  Yeah.  Me and you can be the, but we can't be thee.  Yeah.  That's thee up there.  And he tried to warn him to have the action to back off.  And that thee, he never did what the Lord asked him to do. 
[00:12:30]  You think he's being punished for his arrogance in a way?  Like, or his complete arrogance, you're saying?  Well, I didn't think that the arrogant part of him being like that, the good man.  You and I can't be thee.  Because we don't use that word thee.  Me, you ain't use thee since you've been a head dog.  Thee is the man of staff.  You know what I'm saying?  How is it to meet thee?  I, I, I don't.  He's talking about, you know, all his arrogance.  But then I asked him, like, are you saying he's being punished for his arrogance? 
[00:13:00]  And he should have just said yeah.  But he was like, oh, no.  And he started talking Roland there.  Now he's got to fucking stand before the man.  Do you remember we took photos with him and he did it to all of us?  When you got your arm around him.  And that's why I have a dumb look on my face in my photo.  He does a quick mock punch to your stomach.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Before the camera is snapped.  And you realize.  Makes you flinch.  Dude, he can still break your fucking ribs.  Yeah.  Well, no, he can't.  Not at this moment.  Yeah.  But as of a few days ago.  He easily could have broken your fucking. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Still Joe Frazier.  Rumor has it.  Now, I hope you can confirm this for me.  Joe Frazier ate your steak.  And you kicked him in the liver.  I was like, where are you going with this?  Somewhere dumb.  Oh.  Wow.  That's never going to die.  Oh, my God.  Joe Frazier.  What happened?  He's not answering me properly.  Joe Frazier. 
[00:14:00]  Something's wrong with his liver.  God.  People are convinced I killed that dog.  Ah, well.  What are you going to do?  Yeah.  All I know is I didn't have to sit around a dinner table here and.  Anymore.  So I was happy.  The replacement dog was worse.  Oh, that little yappy thing.  You forgot about Tiffy.  Tiffy.  Was it Tiffy?  It's a Shisu.  Yeah, great.  Tiffy.  I used to feed Tiffy fucking Captain Morgan to quiet her down.  Jesus. 
[00:14:30]  That dog would take a nap.  That fucking dog wouldn't shut the fuck up.  Yeah.  Does Nicole really want us to watch her dog?  Tomorrow's the day.  What?  You just heard the stories.  There's a rumor I killed a dog by kicking it.  Right.  Yeah.  I didn't do shit.  I know you didn't.  Tomorrow's the day.  And and what?  Captain Morgan's to make it sleep.  Yeah, a little Captain Morgan.  You give the dog.  It's sweet.  They like it.  So they'll drink it.  And then they kind of pass right out.  So mash up Nicole's going to bring her dog in here.  She's driving the dog off around seven tomorrow.  What kind of dog is it? 
[00:15:00]  It's like a little poodle type thing.  No.  Stupid dog.  It's not a real dog?  No, it's a shitty dog.  Like a German Shepherd?  No.  It's a very cute dog.  Lab?  Yeah.  It likes to be petted.  What the fuck are we going to do with the dog?  We'll pet it all day.  Play doggy games.  Yeah.  Captain Morgans.  Yeah.  Let it sleep.  Let it rack it.  Fuck.  So Frasier.  That's the big.  Well, there's a lot of fucking news today.  Holy shit.  A lot of big, huge stories happening.  You got Conrad Murray.  You got Herman Cain.  You got that fucking kid toucher at Penn State.  Big stories all over the fucking place. 
[00:15:30]  That cover up at Penn State.  Unbelievable, right?  That's on the lines of the Vatican, that shit.  Joe Paterno's got to go.  He failed as a human being.  He failed as a human being.  He reported some shit, but he failed as a human being.  They said his legal obligation was fulfilled, but morally and just as a person, he knew  what was going on.  He allegedly knew what was going on.  Well, we don't know, obviously, but he had to have known.  He allegedly knew what was going on.  He failed as a human being.  I'm sorry.  And didn't act further, didn't pursue it further, did the absolute minimum he had to 
[00:16:00]  do to protect himself, and then walked away from the situation as this guy continued  to work.  Continued to work for Penn State.  You know, if you see the guy show up for work the next day, you're obligated as a human  being to go in and say, why the fuck is this guy here?  Right, he should not be here anymore.  What did Paterno know?  Like, did he hear something, or did he see something?  He knew, because somebody was a witness and went to him, and said that this guy was in  a shower with an 11-year-old boy, and, you know, diddling around with him. 
[00:16:30]  And they wrote it off as horseplay.  They just said, oh, there was a little horseplay going on in the shower.  Oh, Christ.  Horseplay?  You know.  Why I...  I'm sorry to do this to you guys, but speaking as a fucking father, you would never...  My father.  I can't...  You would never accept that.  A little horseplay?  An 11-year-old with a...  It would be horseplay with Matt, because he's got a cock like a horse.  So I hear.  Horse's ass play. 
[00:17:00]  Horse's ass play.  Paterno should never have accepted that.  No.  That's why he's going to go.  And he showed acceptance by, you know, allowing this guy to continue at Penn State after the  allegations.  Yeah.  You know, and then he had another boy pinned up against a wall as he's blowing him.  All right, well...  This fucking guy should get a bull to the back of his head.  At least he was given a little pleasure.  Yeah, that's how he was beating the kids up.  Wasn't take, take, take.  Giving the kid a hummer.  Here you go, kid.  Hey, thanks a lot, mister.  Take this home with you.  Yeah.  Thank you.  These fucking guys should be shot in the back of their fucking head. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, well...  But there's assholes out there that still don't believe in the death penalty.  Really?  This guy's a piece of shit.  Yeah.  Really is a piece of shit.  And just the fact that he was there after it happened.  In one incident, Sandusky, 67, is alleged to have forced a boy as young as 10 to have  sex with him in the shower at the football complex.  I don't know.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Take the trust of a 10-year-old.  Yeah.  Probably like, oh, yeah, football. 
[00:18:00]  This is going to be great.  We'll teach you.  We'll show you the ropes.  The graduate assistant saw the encounter, reported to Paterno, who relayed the information  to Curly.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  Ghee, ghee, ghee, ghee, ghee.  Gah, gah, gah, gah, gah.  Curly was the athletic director.  He's sucking his dick, Moe.  Hey, you.  Get your mouth off that boy's penis.  Why I ought to...  Hey, what's he doing to his dick?  I think he's sucking on it. 
[00:18:30]  Hey, Moe, hit him with a crowbar.  Gah, gah, gah, gah.  He says, hey, Moe, and the old guy turns around.  So you bring this to me, do ya?  Yeah, Curly stepped down.  Curly stepped down?  Yeah, Curly stepped down.  Boop, boop, boop, boop.  He ran through the wall and left his silhouette in the wall.  Hey, I'm warning you. 
[00:19:00]  Get that penis out of your mouth.  I'm warning you.  Too fucking good, actually.  So he brought these kids to his house.  Yeah.  The locker room showers.  The report tells of an escalating series of predatory activities,  starting with Sandusky allegedly crawling in bed with boys to rub their backs.  Oh, dear.  Moving on to fondling and eventual sexual contact of varying kind. 
[00:19:30]  Woo!  All the pedophiles come out of the repertoire.  Spare me the poisonous bobs, Curly.  And then this guy got clingy.  Uh-oh.  One of the kids says this.  He testified that Sandusky would be clingy and even needy when a young man broke off the relationship he had established with him  and called the behavior suspicious.  Oh, boy.  So he'd fall in love and shit? 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, this guy's a piece of shit.  Ah.  He's a real fucking piece of shit.  Jerry Sandusky.  And he put out a book.  Called Touched.  That's called Touched.  And the whole cover says, Touched by Jerry Sandusky.  Look at that.  That's a real book.  When that first hit Twitter yesterday, I'm like, okay, that's funny, man.  And he's pointing his finger out like he's going to stick it up a bunghole.  That's a weird psychological thing to write that.  Yeah, why would you write that?  Touched by Jerry.  That's a cry for help right there.  Help me.  Look, I'm telling you what I do. 
[00:20:30]  He just wanted help getting little boys.  He didn't want fucking help.  That's a deep, deep, weird psychological thing to write something called Touched by Jerry Sandusky.  That's okay.  They treat him fine in prison.  No, I disagree.  I think...  Really?  Yeah.  I thought the pedophiles got treated very well in prison.  I wonder if they get...  I wonder, is that a myth or there's no...  No, I think they get their ass beat.  Maybe.  Yeah, I think it's like mandatory.  Let's, uh, the phones are lit.  Uh, Joe in Pennsylvania.  Joe?  Hey, how's it going?  What's up, Joe? 
[00:21:00]  Hey, uh, the...  In 2002, when that shower fucking allegedly took place, he wasn't actually an assistant coach at the time.  He, uh, what...  He wrote...  Hold on, just so people know.  I think he retired from that in 1999.  Yeah, in 1999, I think.  But he held this, they call it, like, emeritus position.  Oh, so he could keep coming back to molest children?  That's great.  Right.  Jesus.  Uh, but they, they investigated him in 1999.  But why would...  Can I ask you something? 
[00:21:30]  He was still on campus, right?  And he was still around, uh, the locker rooms and all that?  Yeah.  So why the fuck did a paterno go, look, this guy can't be around?  In my mind, he's a really old guy, and, and he, it, he probably doesn't even fathom that that kind of shit even actually happened.  He wasn't that old in 2002, sir.  He's 84 years old, so in 2002, what, he was 75?  Paterno's 84?  That's true.  Okay.  That's true.  Like, why was this guy allowed to be still around, uh, around campus? 
[00:22:00]  To, to protect the Penn State brand, because they thought that, that, forcing him to stay away from campus was, was going through, that, that would come out in the public.  Well, that's right.  They're worried more about their own image than, than taking care of where they have.  That's right.  That's a call to cover.  I mean, he had a paterno, paterno failed as a man, as a human being.  He cared more about a fucking football program, right, than the shit that was going on right in front of his eyes. 
[00:22:30]  That's fucked up.  Complete scumbag move, absolutely.  I know there's a lot of, uh, hardcore Penn State fans, but that's fucked up.  Literally hardcore, huh?  Woo-hoo.  Turn it off.  I've seen a lot of, I've seen a lot of people walking around with their heads down the last, last day or two.  Why?  It's just a fucking, like, it's like a guy who did something awful.  Why is any Penn State fan affected by it?  It's like, it doesn't mean it's like...  Ah, my alma mater.  But what? 
[00:23:00]  It's not, who cares?  There's only a couple guys.  Penn State is a religion around here, and paterno is the Pope.  I know, I'm just so tired of college sports.  Nice analogy you use, because, uh, it's pretty much what happens.  The Pope blows it off.  They should turn it into a Catholic university at this point.  Yeah.  Ba-da-ba-ba-ba-ba.  People locally are obsessed with Penn State.  Huh?  I mean, it's, people locally are obsessed with Penn State and Penn State football.  I know, it's annoying.  To an unhealthy extent.  Exactly.  That's what they get.  Mm.  For what? 
[00:23:30]  Rooting so hardcore?  No, but being so obsessed with such idiocy.  Mm.  And I'm the last person that should ever say that.  I'm obsessed with idiocy.  Yeah, yours is just different, that's all.  Yes, it is.  People love their college football.  They love their college football team.  I know.  Uh, let's say hi to Tom.  Tom.  Hit it, then.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning, Tom.  Hey, uh, two things.  Number one, that guy who witnessed Sandusky blowing the boy in the bathroom.  Yeah.  Paterno actually gave him a job with the football team, which looks like they gave him a job 
[00:24:00]  to shut him up.  Oh, wait, Paterno didn't witness it?  It was somebody else?  No, somebody else.  Oh, and then went to Paterno.  Oh, went to.  And then Paterno went to Curly there.  The athletic director.  Nah, nah, nah, nah.  The second thing with Sandusky.  And Curly didn't do anything.  We should have went to Mo.  He knows how to put a ball-peen hammer over someone's head.  Nah, nah.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Ah, second touchy little boy's eye. 
[00:24:30]  Why I oughta.  Why I oughta.  But he would.  But then he would.  Not I oughta.  That was a real threat for Mo.  Because then he'd fucking hit you in the fucking face with a wrench.  Continue, Tom.  All right, the second thing is Sandusky actually left the team because he ran a charity called  Second Mile, which was to help support at-risk youth.  So this kid, this guy ran a charity, which supposedly was to help at-risk youth. 
[00:25:00]  And look what he was doing through them.  Well, if you're looking for young peenies, that's the way to do it.  Yeah, you gotta delve right into one of the programs that get your young peenie around.  Yeah, that'll bring a lot of peenies your way.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, there's nothing like that.  And a lot of them coming from broken homes.  Yeah.  And maybe they're influenced a bit more than the average kid.  Wanna see the shower over here?  Right.  You wanna see the showers?  Oh, it's great.  Why don't you take a shower?  Yeah.  Have you been enjoying everything this charity has brought you? 
[00:25:30]  That I've given you?  Exactly.  You know.  It's a two-way street.  Poor kid's in a shower with an old fucking man.  Oh, God.  He thinks he's gonna be kicked out of the damn charity program.  Any adults that are too involved in kid stuff like that, just give me the creeps.  Absolutely.  Why would you want to?  Like, anyone obsessed with that shit is fucking creepy.  And there are probably some listening right now going, shut up.  Shut up.  Don't fucking...  Don't blow up my spot.  I run the soccer team. 
[00:26:00]  I run the elementary school soccer team.  All right.  We're all going out for pizza.  Tom, anything else?  Just that not only did apparently everybody know what the Cianthusky was up to, but he resigned  in the 90s somewhere.  99.  He's been with the team ever since.  They allowed him access to the facilities.  He was still part of the team, even though he didn't actually work for Penn State.  How is this coming out now?  What happened that this is coming out? 
[00:26:30]  I guess somebody finally spoke up all these years later about what happened.  And, I mean, now it's all just all hell's breaking loose.  Because there's actually been people, the athletic director and the president of the university,  and I think Paterno, too, have been all in front of a grand jury now.  Why didn't, like, who actually said something, like, one of the kids said something, and then  they're all admitting, like, yeah, I did hear this, or I did hear that.  Why didn't they just all deny it?  Yeah, I guess one of the kids finally came out, or somebody finally spoke up about what 
[00:27:00]  was happening to the kids in that locker room.  Yeah, one of the kids said something.  Oh, okay.  So, yeah.  He's victim number two, they're calling.  Ah, thank you, Tom.  Let me go to Jim, who wants to defend Paterno, I guess.  Jim.  Jim, what do you got, buddy?  What's that?  What's going on, fellas?  Yeah, I like how everybody's a fucking expert now.  This guy, he thinks they talk to a grand jury.  Read one article, and it tells you exactly that.  The bottom line is this.  The dude retired in 99.  He was being investigated in 98.  Joe Paterno suggested he retired. 
[00:27:30]  And on top of that, Paterno's not the one that gave him keys to the building.  He's not the one that gave him an office, internet access, and a phone.  That was part of his retirement.  Do you agree that Mr. Paterno failed as a human being?  Yeah, I am born and raised in that area.  Diehard Penn State fan always stuck up for Paterno, and even in the worst years.  And I agree, yes, he probably had more of a moral obligation than anything else.  You know, and he should have maybe taken it a little bit further.  But my only problem is everyone immediately, just because it's Joe, wants to go after him. 
[00:28:00]  I mean, you opened up this whole conversation about Joe Paterno should lose his job.  When there's so many other people in front of him that, I mean, you shouldn't even be talking about Paterno at this point.  There's probably five other people in front of him.  They're all going to lose their jobs.  Yeah, they're all going to lose their jobs.  And look, I know just a little bit about Paterno, but obviously you're a hardcore Penn State fan.  The guy's pretty much a god in those parts.  How long has he been there?  For fucking, how long, Jim? 
[00:28:30]  I agree, 50, I mean, he's been there.  50 some odd years, probably?  Without Penn State, that area doesn't even exist.  I mean, it's not just the school and the football program.  I mean, literally, that area just doesn't exist.  Okay, listen to me.  Listen to me really quickly, okay?  So you got a guy like Paterno.  He's like a god in that area.  All he has to do is speak up and say, look, this guy can't be on fucking campus.  This guy would have been gone.  In my opinion, and this is me, I think he did do that in 98.  When he was being investigated in 98, I believe that he did do that in 99 and made the decision 
[00:29:00]  to cut ties with him and the football program and put the ball in the court of the president  and everybody in the athletic director to do what they need to do.  They're the ones that allowed him to continue coming to campus.  I really don't.  All right, that's fair enough.  But you don't think Paterno should have spoke up again after that and said,  what the fuck are you guys doing?  He's still on campus, this guy.  I know he's not part of the football program officially, but the guy's still wandering around.  Well, considering that Joe Paterno left Graham Spanier, the president of the college, 
[00:29:30]  off of his porch in 2004 when everyone wanted Paterno fired, that just shows you the kind  of pull that Paterno had.  How do we know he didn't behind the scenes say, hey, guys, what's being done about this?  And they're like, we're going to take care of it.  We're going to take care of it.  Right.  Fair enough.  He could have went to the law enforcement.  I'm not saying he could have.  But we don't know what he did behind the scenes.  I mean, look at it this way.  And I'm not saying this makes up for it, but Paterno, millions and millions of dollars 
[00:30:00]  affected thousands, hundreds and thousands of kids' lives in such a positive way.  I can't imagine that he just shut his door and was like, I don't want to deal with it.  I'm not saying he didn't go to law enforcement, but I can't imagine.  I think, I hate to tell you this, but I think Paterno was thinking about his own legacy a  little too much and obviously didn't want to be associated with all this crap.  So he went along with the cover-up and keep it all like buried and hoping for the best  that it would never come out.  But now it comes out. 
[00:30:30]  Now Paterno doesn't look too good today.  No shit.  I mean, I completely agree.  But let me, what if you were friends with someone for 40, 45 years, a close, close family  friend, you grew up, I mean, put yourself in his spot.  I mean, how difficult would it be for you if you found something out?  Wouldn't you go to that person?  Well, this question has been going around Twitter, and my answer is, like a lot of  others, I would beat the shit out of the guy.  That kid shit drives me nuts, man. 
[00:31:00]  There's no excuse for it.  I'm not here trying to defend.  I think he's just within a tough spot, and everybody wants to persecute him.  And then the graduate assistant that saw the ass-fucking in the shower was actually  Mike McQuarrie, who, if you've ever watched the Penn State game, he's the red-headed dude  that's standing on the sideline next to Joe with a headset, I usually get yelled at.  He calls in the plays.  Was it ass-fucking?  Because the articles I've read, they kind of are vague.  Oh, boy.  But he's basically fucking a kid in the shower, and he continued at Penn State. 
[00:31:30]  I read the 23-page or 24-page grand jury thing that was posted, and it said that he came  in the locker room at 9.30 at night to put some shoes in his locker and grab some film  tape, because he was, you know, recruiting an assistant at the time, a graduate assistant  at the time.  Walked in, saw the showers off, walked over to them, and saw a boy, which he's described  about 10 years old, with his hands against the wall, and a naked Sandusky behind him  performing intercourse.  Oh, God. 
[00:32:00]  He might have just been rubbing against them.  Oh, that's better.  Okay.  I understand.  That's much better.  And that's what he supposedly went to Tim Curley and Schultz, or he went to Paterno and  told him.  Paterno told, you know, Curley and Schultz, and then Curley and Schultz had three or four  conversations with McQuarrie, you know, the graduate assistant after that.  I mean, that's what I'm saying.  Everyone's talking about Paterno.  I said, Curley and Schultz.  I don't know.  This guy just is flabbergasted.  No, you know way more about this than me, so thank you. 
[00:32:30]  Something Jimmy said.  Yeah.  Something Jimmy said real quick is about, I don't see why Penn State fans are affected.  I know this sounds odd, because I'm, you know, I like terrible humor.  I kind of find myself to be the same kind of guy you guys are, but I'm affected by this.  Yeah, I guess, I guess I understand.  If I found out Dana White and guys who I like were doing stuff, I'd have a newfound respect.  But I guess I understand that.  For some reason, it's just, it's bogged me.  Like, people keep asking me, because they know Penn State fans and friends and stuff, and 
[00:33:00]  I'm like, I don't even know what to say.  I really am kind of just bothered by it.  Well, Paterno, obviously, will step down at the end of the year, but do you think he  lasts the season?  There's no way he continues after this season.  I think he continues after this season.  I really do.  Jesus Christ.  I think, and the only reason, not that there's not going to be people out there with pitchforks,  but one of the other reasons why Paterno was able to survive all the years where they  were doing so terrible, he brings in millions of dollars to that school. 
[00:33:30]  Well, he's the man that holds the keys to so many people donating tons of money to that  place that if they were to dump him and all the administrators at the same time, they'd  be really fucked.  But morally, the college should just take the fucking hit at this point.  Yeah, I don't know if people would stop donating money if they fired them for a kid fucking  scandal.  There's a lot of old cash up there.  That's the thing.  And it'd be there because of Paterno.  And Sam found the part of the transcript that Jim's talking about, and certainly it does 
[00:34:00]  say anal sex with a 10-year-old in the shower.  The college should do what's morally right at this point and just move the fuck on.  Fire everybody.  Bring in what's-his-name who's on the sidelines anyway.  What's that dude's name, brother?  McQuarrie, the red-headed dude?  No, the other coach.  Tom Bradley?  Oh, Shandusky?  No.  Isn't there a guy waiting in the wings to take over for Paterno?  The defensive coordinator, Tom Bradley.  There's rumors of him, but I thought that would happen.  He must not have been as endowed as Matt, the intern. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  He was able to pull that maneuver off.  You know.  Well, all right, man.  Thanks, man.  All right, Jim.  Thank you.  You brought a lot of knowledge to the situation for us.  I appreciate it.  Sure, man.  Mike in Queens.  Mikey.  Mike?  Yeah, just to let you know, this guy had 11 adopted kids.  Oh.  So right there, that tells you, and, you know, the pictures on ESPN of him with the  kids with the roller skating around, it's just too freaky and too weird to, and Paterno 
[00:35:00]  knew about this one in 96.  This guy just put it all out there.  What did he ask the kid's name?  It's obvious.  How many times do you ask the kid's name?  It's so obvious.  Dude, if you get caught in the shower with a 10-year-old, and the college doesn't get  rid of you, you're going to walk around pretty much with your dick out at that point.  That's pretty hard to explain, too.  Because now you know, fuck, man.  I'm in a good place, because they're all going to cover this shit up.  But they gave this guy access to the facility after he retired in 99. 
[00:35:30]  And how many times did Paterno ask?  He never once asked about the victims.  Not once.  Well, who you don't know about that?  He was worried about opponents.  Yeah, everyone knows about that.  He's got to get ready for the big game.  The big game.  Come on in for the big win.  He's worried about the big win.  Yeah, this Sandusky is a piece of shit.  They tried to get rid of Paterno many times.  I don't think they will get rid of him.  You know, he's lost everything.  I think he thinks.  All right.  He's been the head coach since 1966. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  So that's what, 45 years, I guess.  Jesus Christ.  45 fucking years.  He's not going anywhere.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, this is a good point, too.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian.  Hey, good morning, Opie.  Anthony, Jimmy.  Hello, Brian.  Hey there.  The other question I think that needs to be asked.  McQuarrie, the guy who witnessed the event, is a former player.  He's huge. 
[00:36:30]  And this guy's an old man.  If he comes across him in the shower reaping a 10-year-old boy, why did he walk away from  it to report?  Why didn't he put a stop to it first?  And then, you know, report?  I guess everyone didn't want to fuck up their cushy gigs.  Yeah, that's what it looks like.  Plus, maybe.  Because if you're a former player, yeah, of course you'd get in that shower and beat the  shit out of the guy or at least separate the two.  Take a kid for yourself.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, fella, share.  Or maybe he just said something and they separated. 
[00:37:00]  Like, maybe he made a noise and they were like, ah, who knows.  Knock it off.  Knock it off in there.  Come on now.  Might be a penis off.  You gotta do more than that.  Yell at the kid.  Of course you do.  Stop behaving badly and backing into that man.  All right, sir.  Let's go to Bruce in Pennsylvania.  Bruce.  Yeah, hey, guys.  If you'll have Sam read a little further in that transcript, you'll notice there's a conversation  between Paterno and Sandusky where Paterno tells him there is a silver lining to showering 
[00:37:30]  with that 10-year-old.  What?  Yes.  Just have Sam read it.  It's right there.  What's the silver lining?  You can flick their hair back to make them look like they're eight.  Of course.  All right, Kenny.  I remember telling that joke.  Okay.  We got Jerry Sandusky on the line.  Oh, really?  Jerry, you piece of shit.  What do you got?  Hi, Jerry.  I just have one thing to say.  I'm tired of all these allegations and I want to defend myself. 
[00:38:00]  I won't take questions.  I just want to tell you, I didn't do shit.  Oh, damn.  Some people will beg to differ.  I'm pushing that one.  That could be on a t-shirt.  I'm thinking.  Is that the new one?  I'm thinking that one could be on the t-shirt.  I might have to have a couple asterisks.  Can't walk around with the word shit on your t-shirt.  But, wow, it's a hell of a story, huh?  Yeah, it's fucking twisted.  Full of intrigue and cover-ups.  Steve on Long Island, he doesn't understand, like myself, why people are defending paternal so much. 
[00:38:30]  Nobody wants to realize that they kind of bet on a guy who would do something like that.  It's really weird.  It's like we feel like when you like somebody so much who's terrible like that or doesn't do what you think, people are like, that's kind of a reflection on me.  But it's not.  It's probably what made him a great football coach.  He doesn't give a shit about that shit.  He's a cyborg.  I'm serious.  Steve, what's up?  Yeah, I think people are missing the point.  Like if Paterno would have went to these guys and said, if this guy's here tomorrow, I'm not. 
[00:39:00]  That guy's gone tomorrow.  Right.  That's true.  That's my whole point.  That's how much power Paterno has.  I mean, and also, like, a ground assistant is what, 23, 24?  Paterno's a 60-year-old man.  He should go to the, like, he's like the authority figure of the entire place.  He goes to the cops.  That guy's gone.  Everybody's gone.  And he can do whatever he wants.  He's like, fucking Joe Paterno.  Do you think, but is it possible that the guy backed up on his story when questioned again? 
[00:39:30]  Like, I couldn't 100% tell.  It looked like it, but it was real quick.  And he could have just been, I mean, is it possible that Paterno asked the guy and the guy backed off a little bit?  I think he might have if it's because of Joe Paterno.  But even at that point, Paterno should have, like, the moral obligation to these kids to, like, look into it further.  You know, I mean, that's just, you know, a 23-year-old ground assistant, you know, is probably worried more about his future than anything else.  But he didn't tell, though.  We didn't have to worry about that.  You know, Joe Paterno, Joe Paterno.  I don't know.  I am.  You do more than tell. 
[00:40:00]  Jesus.  The whole thing was just brushed under a rug somewhere.  That's crazy.  Where is Penn State?  Is it by Pittsburgh?  It's in Pennsylvania.  No.  Yeah, it's in that state, Pennsylvania.  All right, boy.  That's all I got.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Damn.  Damn.  Damn.  Oh, this story's got more layers, I think.  Yeah.  You're going to see a lot of people that knew things.  You're going to have more people coming forward.  Yep.  Supposedly.  Trying to save their own ass.  One of the guys, he didn't wait around, but supposedly Sandusky was still seen around town with kids. 
[00:40:30]  What the hell was that?  A little fire alarm or something.  Yeah.  It's nice to do it every morning.  Oh, do they?  There's many ways out of here.  If there's a fire, don't worry about it.  I don't give a shit.  Bunch of staircases, huge freight elevator.  I'll pull a Costanza.  Yeah.  Just run.  What?  You're flinging people.  Push women out of the way.  Yeah.  I would so push women out of the way.  Especially if I don't know them.  Fuck that.  Why would you let a stranger go before you?  Ever.  Why?  I don't know.  So you could be a hero.  Why would you? 
[00:41:00]  I wouldn't.  It's every man for themselves.  I'm getting out.  Right.  His oxygen gets burnt up real quick.  But you say that, and people look at you like you're a fucking monster.  That's your instinct, especially if you don't know the people.  Survival.  I don't give a fuck.  And if there's heat involved.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's fucking bad.  You gotta get the fuck out of here.  Titanic, I would be on one of those boats.  Fuck that.  Those flames, man.  That fire hot, fire heat. 
[00:41:30]  That makes you do things that just, it completely cuts your, cuts any evolution off from the  human brain and just makes your brain act like some primal thing.  There's no reasoning to it.  There's no anything.  You just, you just react to, ow, this hurts, must get away.  Your social, whatever social skills you've learned are gone.  Yes.  It doesn't matter.  You will bite the face off a child.  You will beat an old woman with a puppy to get the fuck out of the way. 
[00:42:00]  Well, I told the story when I was in the movie theater and it was on fire or there was a  lot of smoke that billowed into our theater.  I don't know where the fucking fire came from, but it was a lot of smoke and we had to get  the fuck out.  Yeah.  Never saw the end of that dumb movie.  I forgot even the name of the movie.  But we're in the stairwell and the, and the movies theaters are below ground and there  was a point where there was this really old lady holding everyone up as we're going up  the stairs.  I felt like we weren't in danger, danger, but I started thinking in my head, we're going 
[00:42:30]  to have to push this lady out of the way.  You start like putting the situation forward and thinking, all right, if this happens, we  got to do this.  And I contingency plans.  And I saw everyone behind me that everyone's kind of like, trying to be polite, but you're  like, no, it's, it will get to a point.  We're going to have to push her out of the fucking way.  So more people could survive if it was that type of situation.  Who doesn't think like that?  You're not allowed to openly say it, I guess, but no, she was taking forever, every step. 
[00:43:00]  Fuck.  And then the smoke was kind of coming into the stairwell.  I'm not going to make it more than it was, but it was not to the, to the point where  you thought, oh my God, you're like, all right, well, how long is it going to take  for this lady to climb these stairs?  Yeah.  That gets creepy.  Penn State has said that Paterno will not answer questions about the child sex abuse  charges when he meets the media today.  So why, what, what the fuck will the media be asking him? 
[00:43:30]  Like, like, what can you ask him?  About the big game.  Like, are they really going to ask football questions?  No.  They're going to hammer him.  Do you think they will?  They'll hammer him.  I don't even know why he would be in front of the media then.  Because they'll, they'll just hammer him.  And he'll keep saying no comment or whatever, however he says it.  I'm not going to comment on that to let the.  An investigation is on and I can't comment on pending investigation.  Next question. 
[00:44:00]  Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr.  Let's say hi to Dan in Atlanta.  Dan.  Hey guys, real quick.  The reason why the details are coming out about this investigation, this investigation  has been going on for over three years.  Joe Paterno just set, like the weekend before, the Division I records for the most wins ever  in Division I football.  So they waited for him to get the fucking record and then they released all these details.  Well, that's the conspiracy stuff that we all enjoy. 
[00:44:30]  But I mean, it's true.  The timing sounds suspicious.  It seems suspicious.  Well, why did they release it at all then?  Why do they have to release it?  I think all the pressure.  They got eight victims and probably more now.  Ah, it's more than eight.  It's got to be more than eight.  Well, I mean, at least on record right now, they're eight.  There will be more next week or two.  You got to believe that.  And then you got, I'm sure you got, you know, kids with other men now.  They're never going to come forward because it's too embarrassing. 
[00:45:00]  Yep.  I'm getting pulled over.  I got to punch out.  Bye-bye.  Oh, good luck.  Well, stay on the phone.  Maybe we can help you out.  Yeah.  So that's a biggie.  Yeah.  His book was called Touched.  You got to be fucking kidding me.  Touched.  No coincidence there, right?  No, no, no.  That is some deep shit.  Psychological shit.  What do you want to call it?  Touched.  Touched.  Yeah.  But it's about football.  I don't care.  Touched by me.  Touched by me.  His original title of victimized in the shower, they said that it doesn't make any sense. 
[00:45:30]  There's no football title.  No.  What are you doing there?  Shower?  Ass fucked by me.  No, we can't put that on the show.  It's an hour and a half north of Harrisburg for Penn State.  I don't know exactly where it was.  How about that?  Chris in Pennsylvania.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  Thanks.  There was a recent article about how much money these football schools have in their football  account.  Penn State has over $1 billion in their account already. 
[00:46:00]  So what the fuck do they need to raise more money for by keeping this guy on?  No one ever has enough money.  No, they didn't want this.  They kept him on, it's obvious, because they wanted to just, you know, keep this whole thing  on the QT.  Turn that down.  You know, that's why.  Yeah.  They were trying to bury this fucking thing.  By the way, the reviews of his book on Amazon are awesome.  Really?  Oh, are people leaving reviews?  They hate him, yes.  Are they leaving good reviews? 
[00:46:30]  Oh, boy.  100% false advertising by Mr. Sandusky.  Not a single page in this book touches on how to appropriately gain the trust of young  at-risk boys and then use that trust to perpetrate horrifying sexual assaults on the very children  who turn to you for guidance and support.  Wow.  When did it come out with that book?  2001.  January 2001.  Two years after he left the football program.  They only have one, and it's $90. 
[00:47:00]  Holy shit.  Collector's item, huh?  What's the book about?  Just his life in general?  Yeah, I think so.  How to soap up a young lad.  Yeah, exactly.  How to keep the soap out of his eyes so he doesn't squirm.  And the picture of him on the cover with his finger, he's just pointing it like he's ready  to stick at it somewhere.  It's really a poor choice of a cover.  Yeah, it really is.  A long finger, too.  Yeah.  Ow.  Poor lad.  Jerry Sandusky is a waste of flesh. 
[00:47:30]  I hope he rots him in prison for the terrible crimes he committed.  Yeah, he will.  Terrible person.  The awful story of a child rapist and his enablers.  Oh.  Sickening.  Oh, he'll go.  I'm telling you, now that it's all public like this, he'll go.  Oh, he's not going to suffer, though.  Don't protect him and all that bullshit.  He'll have a nice life in prison.  Fucking just remove him from the planet.  But it costs more.  Shut the fuck up.  Do you know it costs more to do the bloody...  Shut up.  Shut up.  A bunch of victims will sleep soundly at night if this fucking guy is removed from the planet. 
[00:48:00]  How do you not believe in the death penalty?  Yeah, some people don't.  Some.  A lot.  I know.  A lot.  All right.  And this isn't even a death penalty case.  I understand that.  I'm not stupid.  No, this is a going to prison with a bunch of people that probably won't like you very much.  Yeah, but they'll protect them because they know that.  That's how that works.  Yeah?  I'll put them in protective custody.  Of course.  Of course. 
[00:48:30]  Wouldn't it be fun, though, to just imagine him in the shower, like, all scared, taking  a shower, and then just watching fucking some big buck come in and just hammers his asshole  open wide.  Plah, plah, plah.  A dick like Matt's.  Yeah.  The guy's got a fucking giant cock like Matt.  Big dick.  He's got a big dick.  Jesus.  I was listening to some of the replay and just going, like, boy, talk about an attention-craving  douche.  God. 
[00:49:00]  That means he's going to come back in here now.  No, please.  I hear our other intern, who's very quiet and does everything right, hates him.  Sal.  Sal hate him?  Oh, yeah.  Sal.  He said he didn't threaten him, of course, but he said yesterday he wishes that he was  in a situation where he could knock him out.  Can we bring Sal in?  Yeah, yeah.  Sal's here.  Sal's the complete opposite of Matt.  He doesn't, like, spend...  Small dick.  He doesn't spend his summers...  Tiny dick.  ...backpacking...  Bring a man.  Sal.  ...and fucking trying to pick up broads.  The guy's trying to...  He's working hard at a career.  Plus, he might be the best intern we've ever had, and it's just completely getting shadowed 
[00:49:30]  by the fact that Matt is such an ass.  Hey, Sal.  Oh, that's Sal?  Yes.  That's Sal.  See how that works?  Yeah.  See how that works?  I'm like, who?  What?  But will you...  Oh, the guy that does his job, and, you know...  How long after he leaves the studio today will you remember his name?  Ah, well, I won't.  That's fine.  I won't.  But the fuck-ups and the shitheads and the attention whores, you can't help but remember  their names.  Right.  Yeah.  This guy's just...  That's kind of right, man.  Unfortunately for you, you actually are doing your job properly and not making any, you 
[00:50:00]  know, any waves, not trying to just get attention.  I mean, yeah.  What's the problem with Matt that you have now?  Yesterday, Paul said to Matt, like...  Because Matt fucking reeks.  He absolutely stinks.  Yeah, he came in here yesterday, and it was wafting over.  Did he smell?  I didn't know.  I was worried about that because I was eating, but...  He does.  He just absolutely reeks.  And he always has his arms up, like, over his head, you know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the producer, and just...  He absolutely...  Oh, God.  Sam, why'd you do that?  He put a picture up of... 
[00:50:30]  That's disgusting, yeah.  Does his pit stink?  Oh, yeah.  So he reeks, right?  So Paul tells him to put his armpit in my face.  And he did it about three times, and I just lost it for a second.  I said, dude, if you do that again, I'm going to knock you out.  And I really just...  I just didn't want to take it anymore, pretty much.  Yeah.  And then you hit the kid.  You know, SiriusXM will get rid of you.  Oh, then you're gone.  Right.  That's like, I was willing to forfeit...  We don't have any more interns.  Which sucks, because you really like being here.  Yeah, I was willing to forfeit everything in that moment to knock him in the throat and just lay  him out.  Yeah, Sal's hated him for a long time, though. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  He like hated.  Like he said, he said to me, I hate...  He said, I don't like hating people because of all the, you know, energy and what an investment  it is, but he said, I hate intern Matt.  Oh, wow.  And it's not because Matt's getting attention on air, because Sal doesn't even really want  to be on air.  Right.  I've talked to Sal.  He wants to do production and things like that, so you spend a lot of time with Troy  and...  Yeah, exactly.  ...working on shit.  But you work hard.  You get working.  Thank you.  Are you pissed off that you work hard and, look, here he is just slumbering down the 
[00:51:30]  fucking hallway.  He's sashaying.  He does sashaying.  Right?  He does that little wrist thing.  Yeah, he does this thing where his arm's kind of like, ooh, he's like on the catwalk.  On the catwalk.  I stink on the catwalk.  Are you guys about the same age?  No.  When I first met him, I thought he was probably like 17, 18, considering his maturity.  Kid's 25.  And he's 25.  He's four years older than me.  Yeah.  That is a weird period in life.  Why do we get old interns, by the way? 
[00:52:00]  I don't know.  Sal's the proper age.  And then why is Matt a 25-year-old intern?  I mean, on average, Matt's probably young for our interns.  We've had 49, 49, 40-year-olds.  Yeah.  I was saying Sandusky is starting up next semester.  Should we let Matt defend himself?  I mean, it's not.  I mean, it's only fair because he's had.  Sal should be able to say it.  Fair enough.  But Matt should be able to come in and at least say that was not true or let Sal say  what he wants to.  Because Sal seems like he'd say it to Matt.  It is totally unfair to just bash Matt. 
[00:52:30]  Fair enough.  I mean, where's Matt?  But you should be able to say what you want.  Yeah, absolutely.  And I said, you think you're tough because you play hockey?  Oh, boy.  Whoa.  Here comes Matt.  All disheveled, by the way.  Look at that.  Look at that.  They couldn't be more opposite, these two.  I've got to sit next to them now.  Oh, boy.  Exactly.  They couldn't be more opposite.  One's got a big old dick.  I'll let you guess which one that is.  That dick is fucking tiny compared to Matt.  That's true.  All right, Matt.  He's got a big dick.  Sal doesn't like you. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, I heard.  Do you understand that?  I do.  I don't have a problem with Sal.  I really don't.  I was a little bit upset, though, yesterday that he took down the Opie Anthony and Matt  sign.  Well, of course he did.  What did you think?  It was real?  That was a dumb dick.  Well, I mean, and I think supposedly he did it without permission from the sex man, which,  you know.  Who needs permission to rip down a stupid sign while he just kind of, on his own accord, 
[00:53:30]  ran in here and ripped it down.  So I didn't think that was right.  Who should you have gotten permission from?  From the sex man.  Really?  You're calling him the sex man now?  Well, it's his name around here.  Really?  You show a little respect, right, Sal?  I mean, what the fuck?  He's not your friend.  He's the sex man, though.  But Eric allows it.  You know, that's Eric's problem.  Where's E-Rock?  He's the boss.  You shouldn't let him pal around with you.  Yeah, the company made Eric the boss of the intern.  The sex man.  So, Eric, you don't mind that Matt calls you the sex man? 
[00:54:00]  I can't do anything because Sam encourages it and everyone just walks around, doesn't  acknowledge me by my real name anymore.  Yeah, but they're interns.  You could override Sam and go, I don't give a fuck what Sam's telling you.  I don't want you to do that.  Right.  I've said it before in the past, but he isn't subordinate when it comes to that.  Then write him up.  Yeah.  Write him up.  Write him up.  HR that shit.  That's what everyone else does around here.  That's right.  The HR that shit.  Use your SM fucking shit. 
[00:54:30]  Remember, what's it called?  Paper that's got your name on it.  Personalized Stationery.  Thanks.  Letterhead.  Whatever it is, I fucking blew it.  Sex man letterhead.  Now, what don't you like about Matt?  I mean, everything.  I try to find one thing to like about Matt.  Give us a list, though.  A list?  Oh, shit.  You don't want to hear that much.  Fuck yeah.  This is all we do.  He absolutely reeks.  And that is just a personal hygiene thing is like a hygiene thing is a very fundamental  thing of when you're in a work environment. 
[00:55:00]  Hygiene.  Hygiene.  Why do you stink?  I don't.  You don't.  Get the fuck out of here.  He does.  Do you shower?  I do.  I shower daily.  Wait, Iraq, you've talked about his hygiene.  Yeah.  When he used to come in from sleeping down at Occupy Wall Street, he'd be down there.  He'd come here, go down there, come here, go down there.  Like three days in a row, no shower.  I don't know if he's wiping his ass when he's shitting or not, but he would just come in  and you're like, dude, you need to go home and take a shower. 
[00:55:30]  He's been better.  It used to be really bad.  I've seen the...  Jesus.  When he phone screens, they actually wipe down the chair after he leaves the room.  Wow.  That's not true.  Wow.  I don't know if it's necessary.  You don't know what happened.  It is true.  And it's not just us.  The Ron and Fez interns also doing a second wipe at the end of the show when we're doing  the transition.  And you should have seen the stuff that comes off the chair at the time.  Like what?  He threw jeans.  It was just brown and black.  How is that coming off his jeans? 
[00:56:00]  Well, dirt.  I guess dirt and soot and fucking...  You got one pair of jeans, Matt?  I got three.  What else, Sal?  Yeah, but how often does he change them?  Not often, I guess.  Every few weeks.  And he also, on certain days, he goes and plays ice hockey.  Doesn't shower.  Goes to sleep and comes back here.  Is that true?  Well, I played last night, but I did shower this morning.  But just that you have done that is gross.  Do you put on deodorant or sometimes forget?  No, I don't wear deodorant. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, you don't?  No.  Oh, jeez.  What do you mean that's fine?  I said that's why.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  I haven't worn it in like six, seven years.  It's just not necessary.  That would probably take care of most of the problem.  It is.  Because I don't stink, so I don't need it.  No, you do, obviously.  Everyone is saying it, Matt.  He has the visual stink behind him, like pig pen.  You know?  That smoke.  It's just awful.  It is kind of.  Deodorant's okay.  His work ethic is just shit.  Like, absolute shit.  Like, I have my old phone.  I have a video of Matt literally nodding off in the chair. 
[00:57:00]  I went in there and, you know, he wakes up and he's like, you know, completely disoriented.  He's like, hey, what's up, bro?  And just ran out of the room.  It's absolutely hysterical.  So if he thinks sleeping while he's here is a good idea, I mean, you know.  Did you ever sleep while he's being taught stuff?  Well, yeah.  I mean, one time I was showing him how to do a promo and Troy comes over.  By the way, I love how Sal, when he talks, he goes limp-wristed like this.  Ooh.  Says the guy who sashayed down the hall.  You did sashay down the hall. 
[00:57:30]  Well, if you've ever seen Sal walk, he walks like this.  What's that?  It's like a lean?  Yeah, he kind of leans to his right as he walks.  It's very odd.  Anyway, so getting back to, uh, so I was showing him how to do the promo and Troy comes over.  Troy, Troy's now facing me as I'm facing the computer.  Yeah.  And Troy just looks at me like shakes his head very slowly.  I'm like, what is it?  I turn around.  Matt is fucking out cold.  Just completely asleep.  Matt, what happened?  Well, yeah, I mean, that happened, but that was like a couple days into the internship. 
[00:58:00]  Right.  And I had a couple days into my internship and I wasn't sleeping.  Well, that's fucking great.  You want to use that time?  I'm sorry, we're not all the star fucking princess interns.  How am I a star fucker?  It's not what I said, douchebag.  I said star fucking princess interns.  Oh, I have to do everything right.  Suck everyone's dick around here.  Well, fuck you.  This is another thing Matt does.  Hold on, hold on.  There's no way I could accept that.  Oh, boy.  Sal stays so far under the fucking radar and just does his job. 
[00:58:30]  Matt just said Sal sucks everybody's dick when Matt's been the one who, from his first  day, was trying to make sure he gave Anthony his coffee so he could say, hey, Ant, I'm  Matt, the intern, and give Opie his breakfast.  Hi, Opie, I'm Matt.  And I don't even drink coffee.  I noticed you.  Exactly.  That never happened.  Matt, I noticed you way before Sal.  Way the fuck.  I was here two weeks before you.  And Sal finally said hi, I think, like, a month into his internship.  And then we talked a little bit.  Well, maybe you were too busy sucking everybody else's dick. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, I mean, Matt literally got in your face the first day.  So what you said, which is fine, but what you said is completely wrong.  Like everything else he said when he's on the air.  Every fucking person who calls in is like, oh, that dude's wrong.  His facts wrong.  And you're fucking transparent.  That's good for fucking them.  Jesus, Matt.  That is right.  Matt.  My God.  I don't think, I think you're more into this for the on-air thing. 
[00:59:30]  And he's actually in it for a career, you know, kind of behind the scenes.  Maybe.  Does a good job.  He'll get a good recommendation letter.  Probably.  I mean, I'm not as good at production and shit as Sal is.  It's not a matter of if you're good at production, it's a matter of just working.  Just work.  I fucking work.  You don't have to work good, just work.  That's his problem.  And first of all, it's none of your fucking business, what I do during the day.  No, it does, because it affects the amount of work.  What I'm doing at every fucking minute.  Okay, it does affect me because the amount of work that you don't do, I have to fucking make up for. 
[01:00:00]  Wow.  So you have to do double intern work?  Picking up your slack.  Exactly.  That sucks.  Like what?  Like any fucking thing.  That's real fucking specific.  Name one thing.  Matt, I ask you every morning.  We record the show on one of the computers.  And I ask him, just at 6 o'clock, I set up everything.  All he has to do is literally click the mouse.  He doesn't even have to fucking move the mouse.  How many fucking days have you forgotten to walk over there?  Oh, it's 2 to 6.  Maybe I should walk over to the computer.  One fucking time. 
[01:00:30]  That is a complete fucking lie.  He sets it up.  He doesn't even have to move the mouse.  He doesn't even have to move the mouse.  He just has to click the left click.  And he fucking forgets.  So shut the fuck up.  One time.  One time.  One time.  One time.  One time is too many, but whatever.  Really?  One time?  I'm not saying more than one.  I have to fucking check.  I didn't check today because I wanted for him to fuck it up.  You have to check.  You're the intern and you check the other intern's work?  He's just the worst.  He fucking sucks.  You're not the boss intern, though. 
[01:01:00]  You're supposed to have to check the other guys.  No, but it affects me because if I got to do the promo, it fucks up how everything gets  saved.  E-Rock's the boss.  Where are we at with this, E-Rock?  Is Sal telling the truth?  Yeah, well, here's the thing.  When Matt started, I noticed right off the bat, if Sal said anything to him, Matt would  go, would you shut the fuck up?  Or you're a douchebag.  Like, there was just unneeded aggression.  Eric's right.  Before Matt was getting all the air time for the Occupy Wall Street stuff, he was trying  to figure out how he could get air time.  And so he used to start fights with Sal on purpose, hoping that we would bring them to 
[01:01:30]  the air.  And because you encouraged it.  No, I told you to stop starting fake fights.  No, bullshit, you totally encouraged it.  I mean, Eric was there and Sterniola was there.  I said, don't start fake fights because I'm not bringing fake fights to the air.  But you were encouraging the whole me versus Sal thing.  I'm saying you were.  I mean, Sal, you were there.  I said, don't start fake fights.  I was there one time when Sam did say that.  But he was encouraging it somehow, right?  If he was, he was.  In his own slick, you know, fucking Sam way, he was. 
[01:02:00]  This is, again, what he's doing.  He's trying to be a character.  Yeah, he's trying to fucking...  But he's saying that Sam encouraged it, though, a little bit.  Like, he's saying Sam said one thing, but we all know...  Right.  Normally, I would say...  That was a little reverse psychology, and it worked perfectly.  But yeah, for a very long time, I didn't even curse it, Matt.  I don't make eye contact with Matt.  Right.  That's why yesterday you told me three times you wanted to knock me out.  Can I finish? 
[01:02:30]  We need to give more air time to the star over here.  Why don't you go tell HR?  You told me you were going to knock me out three fucking times.  If you really think I'm going to tell HR, I had a breaking point.  Wait, no, you would go to HR.  Jesus, man.  Anyway.  Why would the guy that's the aggressor go to HR and go, I'm going to knock out an intern?  He's telling me I'm the aggressor.  It would be your job to go to HR and go, holy shit, I think an intern's going to knock  me out.  No.  So anyway, I finally came to the breaking point when he was fucking putting his armpit  in my face.  I was like, that's it.  I literally had to tell him, you have to fucking chill out.  But it's not appropriate to...  What is armpit... 
[01:03:00]  It's really not.  What does his armpit smell like?  What is his armpit...  How do you not smell him right now?  I'm way over here.  I've never noticed.  Honestly, I've never noticed he's smelling.  You don't smell, do you?  No.  I mean, if Sal wants to smell me...  No.  No.  I really don't.  I absolutely don't.  I smell you.  Iraq?  Does he smell?  I don't know.  I haven't...  No, he's showered.  I guess he finally showered.  I'll be right there.  Iraq's coming in.  He's a trooper.  But Matt showered, so...  I never noticed Matt.  We got him on a good day.  Smelling bad.  Sorry.  I just noticed him doing good on-air content.  He says he showered. 
[01:03:30]  And no, honestly, he did have a great first appearance.  I won't deny it.  I think it was fantastic.  Oh, thank you.  Because he was taken...  I feel so fucking good about myself now.  Because it was taken out of context.  Like, we didn't know who he was yet.  Right.  But if he said the exact same thing as he said on the first day...  Oh, God.  I would look at him like, what an asshole.  But...  Yeah.  An asshole with a big dick.  That's right.  That's right.  That's right.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Yeah, he's got a big dick.  Nice one.  That's right.  What is it?  What is it?  Seven inches?  About seven.  Yeah.  Which means six and a quarter.  Just about hit seven. 
[01:04:00]  Definitely seven.  Paul theorized five and three quarters.  No.  He'd probably close to seven, but he probably pushes the ruler in a little farther than one  should.  But that's acceptable.  He pushes the balls down.  You have to push it in a little bit.  A little cheat, I get it.  Does Paul hate Matt?  Yeah, he's not here today.  But he loathes Matt.  I have no doubt my mom Paul hates Matt.  Iraq just took a whiff.  No, yesterday was really bad.  He's okay today.  Yeah, something was going on yesterday.  He smelled like death yesterday.  The shower he had.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Could have been that.  Could you smell his old jeans? 
[01:04:30]  How many days for those jeans?  Smell the hair part.  This is only like four or five days.  Oh, jeez.  I can't go more than two.  Really?  Maybe three.  You don't wash his jeans.  I put different jeans on like when I get home.  Really?  I'll wear mine a couple days too.  I'll go a couple days, man.  I don't think I can go more than three.  One day.  There's no reason to change every day.  Well, or wear deodorant for six years either.  One day.  Well, if you don't smell, it's not necessary.  No, deodorant's rough, man.  Walking around without deodorant's rough.  And you know, sometimes when you put it on, it fucking burns. 
[01:05:00]  That's why I stopped wearing it.  Yeah.  Burns?  Yeah.  What the fuck are you using for deodorant?  I've never had kerosene.  My armpits have never burned because I'm putting fucking deodorant on.  It's unnatural though.  I know.  Yeah.  You want to smell his jeans, E-Rock?  You got to smell behind.  No, you got to go.  Oh, God.  You don't smell your crotch?  Turn around.  Turn around.  He put his leg up on the couch like he's inserting a tampon.  He wanted the sex man to smell his crotch.  Presenting.  Please fart in his face.  You do.  Your internship's over.  Oh, Jesus.  It smells like dirt. 
[01:05:30]  Like must.  Like musty, dirty fucking.  Yeah, damn it.  Oh, God.  That's like trapped farts.  Yeah, that's all kinds of shit going on there.  All right.  Anything else, Sal?  You just, you know, his general sense of attitude is just fucking awful.  Is it deplorable?  Yeah, it's a good one.  You guys, even though there's a four-year age difference, you're in the same generation.  Yeah.  Do you like guys like this in your generation?  No, I mean, I...  I really don't like to even talk politics that much, but just his... 
[01:06:00]  He always needs to like express his opinion, and sometimes you just need to shut the fuck  up.  Yeah, but when you have an informed opinion, it's okay to express.  Yeah, but if you have an opinion that's based on some relative facts, not a fucking blog,  you know what I mean?  It's not...  Yeah, you don't have to make it political.  I mean, you know, is there laziness that happens in your generation?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I'm definitely lazy with certain aspects of my life.  But you've seen people worse?  Uh, like...  You seem to work hard is what I'm getting at.  Yeah, I mean, I like to work hard. 
[01:06:30]  Maybe it's an illusion just because he stays under the radar.  Ooh.  Is it people that have worked with him?  Yes, it's an illusion.  He stays under the radar, and then he gives us a whole bunch of stuff that he has done.  So now, while I was sleeping, too, in the process.  I've seen Sal many times sitting in the office, on the chair, chilling out, on his phone...  After his work is done.  ...texting.  Yeah.  He's saying he's pretty much lollygagging, playing the role.  Yes.  Yes.  He's very smart.  He's very slick. 
[01:07:00]  Uncle Paul episode four.  Who put this together?  That would be Sal.  Sal put this together.  Oh.  What about the Jocktober update that we have?  What, this one?  Yeah.  That was Sal's handiwork, actually.  Sal.  No, I can't even take credit for it.  Because Sal really likes production.  Yeah.  So he's working hard.  He loves production.  In between texting and lollygagging.  Yeah.  Are you lollygagging?  Lollygagging around.  So you're saying that he gives the illusion of work while he's really sloughing off in the office.  Yeah.  He's got everybody.  Sal lollygagging. 
[01:07:30]  Matt's got a big dick.  We got some good interns this time around.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Troy would back up Sal, right?  Troy is a big Sal supporter and a big...  All right.  Get Troy in here.  Why doesn't Troy like Matt?  He really doesn't like Matt.  Why?  Troy doesn't like Matt at all.  You know why?  Because I'll...  Which is odd.  Because they both kind of look at things the same politically in a way.  Like, they're on the same side of the fence.  Before Troy hits the mic, Eric, how many people like Matt?  Do you have any supporters, Matt? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  Who?  Roland's a huge supporter.  Roland is?  Yes.  I don't know.  Me and Roland are buddies.  Roland's a huge shitster, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Troy?  You back up Sal as far as a hard worker goes?  Oh, yeah.  Sal's the man.  Sal really works hard.  He does a good job.  He's proactive with trying to look for more stuff to do and pushing himself to see how far he can take it.  And he wants to be in production eventually, so...  You don't think that's an illusion? 
[01:08:30]  None at all.  Have you seen him lollygagging?  No, I mean, there's been times...  There's been accusations of lollygagging.  Yeah.  There's been times that he's put in a real hard working day, and I've just been like, you know what?  You've done enough today.  You can head out if Eric's done with you.  But then how come people are saying that you don't like him?  If Matt does that, why...  Who?  No, Sal.  Oh, oh, oh.  Not Matt, Jimmy.  Yeah, not Matt.  And what's your problem with Matt?  Well, Matt's a little bit...  Does he have the same work ethic?  No, he's a little bit of a goofball, but there's times where I'm slightly... 
[01:09:00]  I'm becoming more amused by him.  Yeah.  You know, like yesterday, he just...  He had a ridiculous appearance on the show, and it made me laugh.  I mean...  It was a good appearance.  I don't know if he's going to...  People are laughing at you, but...  Yeah, I mean, I don't know if he's going to get a job here, or if anybody here would  give him a good recommendation.  Oh, it's not a chance, but...  No.  He's fallen into that zone.  Yeah, not a chance.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know, it's like Love Buzz, where he was just a...  He was a goof.  Love Buzz.  I was about to say, I call it the Love Buzz zone. 
[01:09:30]  Poor guy is like, still emailing, hey, any openings?  Serious?  Which one was Love Buzz?  He was the one who was announced as the stupidest intern in the history of the show.  He was dumb, right?  He was the dumbest we've ever had.  Punch up a picture of Love Buzz.  I forgot Love Buzz.  Let me see Love Buzz.  Who was the one that wore the shit hat?  That was Cream Pie Jones.  No, it's Cream Pie Jones.  I miss him.  I forgot about Cream Pie.  Love Buzz.  I love the fucking nicknames.  Cream Pie is also like $150,000 in debt from college.  Why would you announce that? 
[01:10:00]  Of course that usually brings it up.  Oh, I remember Love Buzz.  That guy was an idiot.  I loved Love Buzz.  What a dope he was.  Wow.  He wore Lakers shirts and you'd ask him basics about basketball.  He had no clue.  He said he's a fan.  He was a fan.  That's why he had the shirt on.  So then we asked him basic Lakers questions.  Wouldn't he get lost everywhere he went to go get stuff?  Yes.  Yeah.  Is he the one that got lost in the subway looking for a Dunkin' Donuts?  Was that him?  No.  No, that was one of the liars. 
[01:10:30]  Somebody who...  Was that Stevie?  Stevie.  That was Stevie.  Stevie got lost a lot.  Because he kept saying he knew where he was going and he didn't.  Hilarious.  They're fucking clowns.  We got in and out of here.  Cream Pie Jones is now in the intern David camp of this show has cost me jobs.  So he's not...  It doesn't acknowledge?  No.  Cream Pie Jones thinks that his shithead experience has made it so that nobody in radio takes him  seriously.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  That's too bad.  Why? 
[01:11:00]  A doody hat.  Is it because he goes out, looks for work, and they Google him and they see him putting  my duty on his hand?  Doody hat.  No.  See, you're not even close, Matt.  You're not even close to the stars we've had.  I got some tweets yesterday that said I'm not as good as Love Buzz.  You're not like that.  You're not like an intern David.  You know what it was?  Because Cream Pie Jones, Love Buzz, and intern David all did it effortlessly.  Like, Love Buzz was just...  Right.  That was just him.  He wasn't putting it on. 
[01:11:30]  He wasn't trying.  He was just...  He didn't even know how stupid he was.  Do you miss David?  I miss David.  I miss David.  Every day I wake up saying...  It hurts.  It would be much easier to go to work if I knew David was in here.  Absolutely.  David was in here.  Troy, what else on Matt?  Super Jew David.  He was great.  The one thing you had to give him credit for is none of those guys could ever get laid.  Matt gets laid.  So you have to sort of...  Yeah, but none of those guys had a big...  Like, a really big dick.  Right.  Ah, that's true, too.  Right?  Did you get a talking to yesterday, Matt?  From who?  I don't know.  A certain female? 
[01:12:00]  Yes.  Yeah, she called me.  She heard the segment and...  Did she send the picture we demanded?  No.  I don't think I'm getting that picture.  Why?  What's wrong with her?  It was all nice stuff.  Did she tell you...  That's what I thought.  No one badmouthed it.  You said she was great.  He said she had a clitoris in the middle of her vagina.  Well, he made some mistakes.  Couldn't even point out her genitals.  But you said she had a nice vagina.  I don't think that's a very nice thing.  Did she tell you to fuck off?  Yeah, she wasn't happy that she was like, you know, oh, fucking Opie and Anthony, they're  creeps. 
[01:12:30]  You know, I don't want a bunch of fucking guys talking about, you know, my vagina and my  pussy.  She said that about us.  She's not wrong.  Yeah, and her friend...  She threatened me, and her friend threatened me, and then...  Threatened you as much?  ...in the conversation.  Just tell me if I ever talk to them again.  They're gonna, you know, knock me out.  I understand you are 20 times the fucking creep I am.  Wait, but a guy threatened you or a girl?  I don't know if that's possible.  Come on.  Yes.  Come on.  It's true.  Yes.  Wait, her girlfriend or her guy's friend?  You're furrowing around like a mole trying to find a clit.  Shut up.  He's looking...  You stink.  Sam has a really good story about him being a total creep. 
[01:13:00]  Who?  Oh, your turn, Matt?  Yeah.  Well, I heard a rumor.  I don't know if it's true or not, but apparently there was a girl who...  I won't mention where she works, but there was a girl who he was working with at the time,  and I guess he asked her to go to lunch.  This is just what I heard.  I don't know if it's true.  And while they were at lunch, he talked about porn and sex.  Right, yeah, see?  And just all kinds of creepy stuff.  See, you ghoul.  And so she was completely creeped out by him. 
[01:13:30]  Wait, this is like a first date?  Yeah.  Type of situation?  Like he met her at work and said, let's...  Travis Bickle.  That's great.  Yeah, that's great.  Yeah, exactly.  Take it to the porno movie.  And so after lunch...  You barely knew this girl when you did this?  I love that.  What balls?  I'm trying to figure out who he's talking about, but I think I know.  Okay.  And then after lunch, she said, I gotta go.  I'm gonna head back to my place.  And he said, well, why don't I tag along?  And she was like too weirded out to say no.  So he got onto the subway with her. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, God.  But she didn't want him to know where she lived.  Yeah.  So on her way home, she went into like a nail salon and Matt went in to use the bathroom  and she ran away.  Nice.  And ditched him.  Yes, that did happen.  See, you're a creep.  That's creepy shit.  That's creepy.  You wanted to fuck her though, right?  Yeah.  She's a very strange girl though.  Oh, yeah.  Real strange.  She didn't like being followed home or talking about porn.  Yeah, runs away from a fucking stalker. 
[01:14:30]  I don't think she's gotten laid in a couple years and she was a little bit, I think, weirded  out by the whole sexual vibe of it.  Yeah, it's her fault.  That's good.  It's her fault.  Yeah.  Blame it on the victim.  Blame it on the victim.  That's good.  That's good.  Hey, you can't knock him.  He's just trying to get a little puss in the fucking chicken.  Who bought lunch?  Uh, nobody.  It was just, we split.  I like that.  Yeah, you go Dutch.  Go Dutch.  Yeah.  I never like to buy lunch or dinner or anything.  It's 2011.  You make them pay their shit.  What a fucking dick.  It goes with his last name. 
[01:15:00]  And then you try to fuck him.  Yeah.  I like this kid a lot.  I don't know how anybody can't love him.  What a dick.  And you have to give him credit for getting laid and he smells so fucking bad.  You know what I mean?  And that chick, though, is like calling me and Opie and this show creeps.  And yet you, she fucking gets close with you and you're like fucking horrible.  I wouldn't say that.  I don't think she's a good judge of fucking character, to tell you the truth.  Not only close, he slipped her the red hot dig alone.  Yeah.  Dig alone.  I do not think she's a good judge of fucking character, to tell you the truth. 
[01:15:30]  You're a good dude, though.  I'm a good guy.  No, he's not a good guy.  I really am.  He's a shithead and he's a creep.  What?  The girl's got a big pussy.  He was trying to get me some photos.  Yeah.  He's a good kid.  I still will try.  You guys are bonding over the big pussy.  I'm still going to try to smooth it over.  Which we don't know about.  Why wouldn't you?  It might take a few days.  Again, figuratively sucking the dick of the show.  Just like you said, you know, you do.  Well, just helping out a buddy.  Well, it's not, yeah.  And it's not only for you.  I mean, it's for my own pleasure as well.  Oh, sure it is.  Yeah.  That's what I look.  Yeah.  All right.  That's what I look. 
[01:16:00]  You have no idea.  I'm not on Team Matt.  How much the staff, like, especially Sal.  Troy is trying to be, I think he's afraid of being too mean to an intern.  Troy's getting on my side.  You're not supposed to really smash interns on the air because they're just interns.  But Troy hates Matt with every fiber of his name.  And Paul can't stand him.  Paul hates Matt more than anyone.  That's not true.  No surprise there.  Paul likes me, though.  I don't know.  I hate Matt.  You, Sal.  Everyone.  I spend the most amount of time with him.  Danny.  I'm in that camp. 
[01:16:30]  Danny won't talk to Matt.  Like, he's at the point where he's like, it's not like, hate is too much emotion.  He just won't deal with him whatsoever.  I just don't deal with him.  He doesn't exist in Danny's eyes.  Oh, you don't like Danny either, though.  You're not a big Danny fan.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, really?  Why?  Why aren't you a big Danny fan?  He's just kind of a dick.  He's just got an attitude for no reason.  I like Travis.  I like Troy.  Paul's okay.  Paul's kind of a dick sometimes, but Paul's okay.  I like E-Rock most of the time.  Roland, I fucking love.  But E-Rock, can be what?  Touch and go? 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  I mean, sometimes he's a little annoying, but in general, I like him.  Sorry, because I keep checking if you're doing any work.  And what's the answer usually?  He's like, yeah, I'm getting to it.  And he's looking at hockey videos on YouTube.  Right.  I have done everything you've asked me.  What do you have to do?  Now, let's say we're done here in the studio.  What are you going out?  What do you have to do now?  What's the rest of your day entail?  I'm going to work...  Don't be vague.  Give me specifics.  Okay, I'll probably go take breakfast for everybody, which I do every day, which I very 
[01:17:30]  much enjoy.  Can we just eat?  I get breakfast for everybody.  I just ate.  Not for you guys, for the staff.  Oh, stop.  Matt, stop.  Just so you guys know, I'm the one who gets all of your breakfast.  Uh-huh.  And there's a specific reason why, because Kenny asked.  Yes.  Asked why.  Kenny does want Matt Cusner.  Kenny's not a big fan.  I won't say it, but it's understood.  So you go to get breakfast.  That's good.  Okay.  Then what?  And then I'll go back in the office to Nexar Roland and work on stuff E-Roc gave me.  Stuff E-Roc?  No, no.  I want specifics.  I want specifics. 
[01:18:00]  Well, today I'm listening to old Anthony bits from 2011.  Enjoy.  Riding sugar cookies.  Enjoy.  Jesus Christ.  Sounds like a good job for the day.  Yeah, that's for sure.  Sounds like the perfect job, doesn't it?  Laugh horrific.  They're pretty good bits.  Yeah, they are.  They are pretty good bits.  You're going to enjoy yourself today.  Hilarious.  For sure.  Jesus.  But E-Roc can be slightly annoying sometimes if he's fucking...  Yeah, sometimes, yeah.  I don't understand why Danny's his least favorite.  Yeah, I don't like Danny at all. 
[01:18:30]  I've never seen any interaction between the two.  Yeah, it's just every time we've ever talked, it's just the braces.  Danny's a funny guy, yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  What do you mean you don't agree?  Yeah, I don't think he's that funny.  I've really never heard him say anything funny.  Jesus.  He's said so many things, too.  Jeez.  Holy shit.  I haven't heard it.  No, I mean, I'm just saying you've heard him say things.  You just don't find him funny.  Right.  I don't think I've ever laughed at anything he said.  Wow.  I'm sure he hasn't laughed at anything you said.  Maybe.  You don't care? 
[01:19:00]  No, I really don't care.  Well, this won't end here, I'm sure.  You don't think so?  No.  Are you worried?  I think.  About what?  Danny being married?  No.  Why do you think you could kick Danny's ass?  Uh, yeah.  What?  Why do you think that?  He's a small little twat.  I mean...  Well, you're not going to fight anyway.  It's just...  No, I mean...  I've just been figuring...  Right, right, right, right.  You just kind of think, you know...  He's a small little... 
[01:19:30]  Wow.  Jesus Christ.  That's fucking harsh.  You're saying it's like a little dog who barks loud?  Yeah, yeah, pretty much.  Wow.  Wow.  Schnitzel.  How many actual brawls have you been in in your day?  Uh, probably 30.  30 fights?  30 fights?  Yeah.  Why so many?  Minus the 7 inches, so that was at least 23.  Yeah, yeah.  Why so many? 
[01:20:00]  Some, you know, drunken fights and some hockey stuff.  No, hockey fights.  No, stop it.  All right, if you don't count, if you want to just know, like, bar fights, probably, like...  Yeah, fights.  Yeah, like...  20.  20 fights, yeah.  Shit.  I would probably believe that.  And how many do you feel you walked away from as the winner?  As the winner?  Uh, maybe, uh, five.  Yeah?  You've lost most of them?  Yeah, yeah.  Usually, I've gone up against a bigger guy. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, you're a man.  You don't back down.  No, you don't back down.  I mean, I've gotten smarter as I've gotten older.  I don't...  I don't see that.  I don't confront people anymore.  You know, if there's a conflict, I try to walk away from it.  You confront people every day at work.  You confront people with your stupidity, your dishonesty, your fucking general malaise.  Terrible things about one of your superiors just five seconds ago.  Well, he's not really a superior.  I mean, I thought...  He can absolutely tell you what you can or can't do around here. 
[01:21:00]  True, true.  That, in my words, I think is a superior.  I think you're being...  But just because he's a superior.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus, Jimmy.  All right.  Oh, man.  We've got to take a break, Sal.  Oh, I can't wait to hear the conclusion of this one.  Troy, thank you, Matt.  Thank you.  Me neither.  I think that's it, right?  Are you worried?  No.  Why would I be?  We go to break.  It's just Danny.  Oh, man. 
[01:21:30]  We go to break with something Sal put together.  Oh.  Another episode of Uncle Paul.  Yeah, the golden boy.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul, now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, because here comes Uncle Paul.  We show you how to make a big boy love you.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul remembers babysitting a young Opie. 
[01:22:00]  You remember.  I used to babysit you.  I'd poke my you-know-what through the crib, and you'd grab it.  He was a little blue-eyed Gregorio.  He was the cutest one.  Yeah.  I told you.  Him and his brother would play the game.  The peenie flip.  I'd say, go ahead, flip your peenie.  Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.  Sure.  And his mother would take pictures.  Take pictures when he was in the tub.  Yeah, and then the court said she had to leave, so she went with a Jewish fella. 
[01:22:30]  I'd kiss his shoulders real tender.  And I'd say, this is what happens.  The man puts it in.  I'm going to fertilize you.  I'm going to show you how we start life.  Push back a little bit.  Come on, eat your ice cream and push back.  Show Uncle Paul you want a baby.  I'm going to make you, I'm going to make you pregnant.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here. 
[01:23:00]  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, because here comes Uncle Paul.  This is the O.P. Anthony Channel.  On SiriusXM.  What does that guy think he's an Indian?  What is he, a goddamn asshole?  What the fuck is he doing?  Not ever.  No way.  Now he's Johnny Hammersticks. 
[01:23:30]  Hammering away like he's freaking Tommy Noble.  What the hell is he doing?  Think she's got to go and bossing over.  No way.  No way.  What is this garbage?  What is this?  Oh, I'm king of the trees.  I'm the tree meister.  I count on them.  What sometimes I pry, I like to stealst.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, right. 
[01:24:00]  This guy's a faggot.  Guy's some sort of faggot Indian in the teepee.  Oh, this guy thinks he's Captain Knots.  Thinks he's Captain Ty and Knots.  When everyone needs some knots tied, they go to him.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.  They...  Bull...  This woman's such a bitch.  Thinks she's Miss Sand.  Drinking out of cups.  Being a bitch.  I bet her fist.  I bet her fatalisk.  Barned.  Pat her skum pat her little kid in the background. 
[01:24:30]  Fucking going crazy.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Who's this guy?  Mr. Balloons.  Mr. Balloon Hands.  No way.  No way.  Get real.  Like those things.  Mr. Walkway.  Mr. Walk down me.  I'm the walkway.  Lead me to the building.  Fuck you.  5643.  Yeah, right.  You're some stupid bitch.  Who paid for that floor?  Not me.  No way. 
[01:25:00]  Never gave a new floor ever again.  Not once.  Not never.  Nope.  Whose chair is that?  Who bought that goddamn chair here?  That's not my chair.  Not my chair.  Not my problem.  That's what I say.  No way.  Stupid dresses.  Stupid flowers.  Lighthouses rule.  You don't like the lighthouse?  You suck.  What is this?  Seahorse captain?  What is this?  Seahorse seashell party?  Who didn't invite me?  Why didn't I get invited? 
[01:25:30]  Seahorse sea hell?  What is this?  Get real.  I'm in love with seahorses.  I'm in love with them.  They're so beautiful and cute.  I'm in love with the seahorses.  They're fucking unreal.  I love them.  They're like all the clocks.  I love them.  I love seahorses.  And I love looking at them.  And I love seashells.  I love seashell things.  I love things with seashells and seahorses on them.  Like blankets.  And towels.  And little bags.  I love them.  Seahorses.  Forever.  Where one vigilante engineer disregards the law of the land. 
[01:26:00]  Fuck you and your rules.  Your rules.  Only the strong will survive.  I'm much bigger man than you are.  Marcelino Centeno is.  We're gonna fight.  Livewire.  I'm not afraid of your information.  Engineer or no engineer.  Livewire looks to take down the bad guys at any cost.  You have a difficult personality and you're an asshole.  But you're our engineer.  You could drop dead right now.  I wouldn't give a fuck.  Whining and complaining get you nowhere with Livewire. 
[01:26:30]  I'm still waiting for a Christmas dinner from five years ago.  That's exactly my point, you stupid fuck.  Little dick motherfucker couldn't even get it hard.  No action adventure will get your blood boiling like this.  Strap in, folks.  This is where it gets really exciting.  Because I'm the truth-sayer.  Livewire.  Coming soon to a theater near you. 
[01:27:00]  Now loading recent tweets from the Opie and Anthony show.  Recent tweet from Opie Radio.  Know when I learn the day's weather?  When I step out of my building and go,  Fuck, I should have looked at the weather.  Follow the Opie and Anthony show on Twitter.  At Jim Norton.  At Anthony Cunha.  And at Opie Radio.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:27:30]  All right.  Can you fade that down for a second?  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the sex man.  I noticed the sex man was playing a little Zeppelin there, Anthony.  Yes.  Wow, that is a powerful one. 
[01:28:00]  That's powerful.  Sex man, what do you got today?  Did something a little topical there, did you?  Led Zeppelin 4 was released 40 years ago.  Oh, 40 years ago.  40 years ago.  Led Zeppelin 4.  Fuck.  Really?  Wow.  That's not a fan of the Zeppelin 4.  Well, not really.  No?  I like some Zeppelin, but what Zeppelin do you like?  That's a good tune, this one.  Was never a big fan. 
[01:28:30]  What Zeppelin do you like?  Uh, uh, uh, Battle of Evermore?  I like that one that goes...  That's a good one.  Cashmere.  Cashmere you like?  Gets a little melodic, though.  Yeah, that's kind of cool.  You don't like melodic shit, don't you?  No?  No, I like melodic stuff.  Sure. 
[01:29:00]  Dancing Days is the one you did, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, okay.  For a second I was like, fuck.  All right.  Yeah, you know, not bad.  That's just too much of it's...  Ugh, enough of his...  And it just reminds me of how bad his real voice is.  Well, now.  He can't hit those notes.  Even then.  Even then, when he was live, he couldn't hit this.  This shit.  It's annoying.  He fucking could hit some notes.  In the studio.  Out live.  I don't know.  Find me one live performance where he sounds fucking good. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  He can't.  All right.  Where he hits it like the record.  All right.  Let's do that, Sam.  I don't think you can.  I gotta say, because this commercial is everywhere now, that Jonah Hill Call of Duty fucking Modern  Warfare 3 commercial is amazing.  It's fucking funny as fuck if you played the game.  That looks cool.  And it's so funny because as a, you know, as you're a noob, you're just getting trashed  constantly.  That fucking commercial would have been the number one Super Bowl commercial.  Obviously, they couldn't wait until the Super Bowl because the game's coming out, what, 
[01:30:00]  today?  Yeah.  But that commercial was well done, man.  Yeah.  Really fucking well done.  The special effects, the comedy.  It's a perfect commercial for the game, no?  Yeah.  Totally.  And it just was one of those things where if you know the game, it's that much funnier.  Because you do all those dumb things.  How many times I fucking had the RPG and I go to shoot it and it fires five feet in front  of me and just blast the shit out of me or a mine pops up and be like, fucking mine. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  And just shooting at somebody and not hitting them and they take one shot and just take  your head off.  Finally, a cool commercial.  Yeah.  Commercials suck.  I was watching, obviously, a lot of football this weekend and that commercial came on.  It was refreshing.  Did you see the one for the McRib with the lady that goes, obviously, I married a 14-year-old.  Oh, yeah.  It drives me insane.  I've seen that one.  Nick DiPaolo, I think, brought it to our attention first about how the white guy has  to be beat down.  Yeah, yeah.  But this one takes it to a whole other level. 
[01:31:00]  The guy's excited about a McRib.  She has to be all like, ah, obviously, I married a 14-year-old.  I had a 14-year-old.  How is that funny?  How is that a good commercial?  They're doing it with, I forget what else.  Oh, with the guys in the beer commercials where they're like, they're implying the guys  are sissies.  Yeah, you got to make all the guys sissies or dumb or whatever.  There's a million examples, but this is the latest.  That's why I'm bringing it up for the McRib.  Hit that really fast.  Now boarding group four to Barbados.  Going to Barbados. 
[01:31:30]  Babe, no cell phones on the honeymoon.  Just check this text.  Shut up.  Take my cell phone.  Pause.  Pause.  Of course.  Pause.  This is what drives...  Why would you marry someone like this?  Yeah.  That would be on your shit like that.  Maybe she sucks good keck.  Yeah, maybe her pussy's big.  Yeah.  And then look at him like, oh, please, can I have my cell phone?  Is it okay if I have my cell phone?  Look at his eyes.  Please?  Just this one time?  Can I talk?  He's got to fucking kowtow to her bullshit.  No one would marry that. 
[01:32:00]  Play kowtow to your whimsy.  So why are they representing marriage in this way?  No one would marry a broad like that.  It's a good sign for us as men, though.  I'm telling you.  Because it's the fucking allowing the dummy to fucking win.  That's all that...  It's fake, feel-good nonsense, which means it's not based in reality.  And the cell phone thing doesn't...  It's when she goes, I married a 14-year-old, drives me nuts.  It's awful.  Backups.  The whole thing is awful.  Yeah, it's ridiculous.  Shit.  All right, here we go.  Oh. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, not now.  What's the matter?  McRib is back.  Let's send him a picture.  Yes.  I'm going to miss it.  I married a 14-year-old.  McRib is back nationwide.  So get the word out, because that sausage...  Look at the Hispanic guy, the black guy, the white guy.  The simple joy of big news.  And she can't believe...  She looks to her...  When the guys show the other three guys the picture, she's like...  Yeah.  Ugh.  How about you fucking parody a woman and make her kind of dykey or stupid? 
[01:33:00]  Cunty.  Yeah, cunty.  Make her a cunt.  Make her cunty.  They won't, because there's too much truth in it.  I hate it.  It's terrible.  That commercial is driving me nuts.  That and the stupid caveman Geico shit they're still going with.  Why?  It was a failed sitcom.  Move on.  Hey, what's worse is the stupid gecko ones, because...  I don't even know what's happening in them anymore.  Like, I hear it.  I hear the voice.  I hear that, you know, the Geico tag at the end.  Yeah.  But the whole thing in the middle, where the dumb gecko's talking... 
[01:33:30]  I don't know what the fuck is going on.  I could care less, too.  Is this the latest one?  You want to save money on car insurance?  No problem.  You want to save money on RV insurance?  What?  No problem.  Walk it across the Brooklyn Bridge.  You want to save money on motorcycle insurance?  No problem.  You want to find a place to park all these things?  Forget about it.  This is New York. 
[01:34:00]  Hey, little guy, wake up.  Oh, come off it, Mike.  Geico.  What is that?  I hate the gecko.  It's not funny or cute.  It stinks.  Nothing.  I don't get that.  It's just dummies thinking that's clever advertising.  Hi, Mike.  You want to drive your car?  Well, you need a mascot.  Oh, it's fucking awful.  It's just awful.  Caveman, much worse.  Yeah.  There was one Geico commercial.  I can't even remember what it was.  That's not the one?  That was slightly entertaining. 
[01:34:30]  It didn't have the gecko in it.  It all started with the Bud Frogs.  That's when this fucking amphibian obsession started.  Bud.  All right.  That was clever the first time.  Oh, yeah.  When it first hit, it was all right.  It's that they have to hammer it home.  And make it the face.  Right.  Who's the caveman?  The Geico too?  Here.  This is the one.  I did get you on the field.  You are Brian Arapbo, all pro linebacker.  Surely you could do better than this.  Come on, sunshine. 
[01:35:00]  It's game time.  Ah, he's in a cheerleader uniform, and he's a caveman.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  It's got me on the bottom of the pyramid.  You know what else is embarrassing?  Paying too much for car insurance.  I fucking hate Geico.  Who the fuck thinks that would be a good commercial?  It's not funny.  It's horrible.  And the fact that they're just trying to do other stuff, like you're supposed to be interested  in the characters.  Right.  How about you tell me how much it's going to cost if I haven't been pulled over for drunk  driving?  Fucking assholes.  They're competing against each other.  I get that part of it. 
[01:35:30]  And Flo.  You got Flo with Progressive.  Those seem to be working for Progressive.  And then you got the farmer's insurance with Schillinger from Oz.  And then you got the other guy from Oz doing the other insurance commercial, where he's  a mayhem.  Allstate.  Allstate.  And then you got the black guy that's, you're in good hands.  Is that Allstate?  Yeah.  Oh, he's that.  The black guy that comes in and is like, whoa, what are you doing?  Drive safe.  You know what I was saying?  I'm a hot babe out, Chuck. 
[01:36:00]  You know, I was saying who would marry that woman from Rip.  I knew there was at least one out there.  Like, Nevada Drifter writes, trust me, someone would marry her.  Some dumb shit like me.  I did at one point.  Crazy fucking, wouldn't let me have a cell phone.  Really?  Yeah.  Remember that?  I was like, yeah, I'm going to get a cell phone.  No, you're not.  Really?  And then I was like a bad influence on you because I had a cell phone. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  Well, we're kind of in, we're kind of in media and we kind of need to be on  top of shit.  I was like, if they're fucking, if something happens in the car or  something, I want to have a phone.  Well, then get a car phone.  Like, what am I, Mannix?  My fucking Canon?  Get a car phone.  Car phone?  What year is this?  With a little pigtail antenna on the fucking back window?  Bitch.  Everyone had cell phones.  Yeah.  We weren't.  We were kind of late to the party.  We really were.  Yep.  We were late to the cell phone party. 
[01:37:00]  I remember.  I got my first cell phone in 1999.  No.  Yep.  You didn't have one in Boston?  Nope.  Nope.  Nah.  Swear.  So I must have got mine late in the Boston run.  She was so fucking much of a bitch that it was, again, this was how I dealt with my  entire matrimonial year, was she was so much of a bitch, I would just not make an 
[01:37:30]  issue.  Oh, is that the worst?  I'd just be like, you know, it's better to just not argue.  And it never changes.  They never stop being a bitch.  No, no.  They never stop.  They just never do.  So you might as well just lay into them.  Fucking annoying.  That's why Anthony's enjoying his life now.  That's right.  I love that Anthony is fucking doing what he does.  Ah, love it.  I'm so separated from that whole time now.  I truly know the shit we went through.  Holy fuck.  You get a car phone.  So if there's an emergency, it's in the car.  But I'm not going to sit around like, you have a phone. 
[01:38:00]  Why?  Why?  Give me one reason.  What if I said that?  It would be like, big fight.  She was one that like, at two in the morning, when I'm trying to sleep, I'll be like, I  got to get up.  I got to get up for work.  I got to do it.  She'd fucking get on the bed and just be like, really?  Really?  You got to get up.  You got to get up.  And I'd sit there and just be like, I can't.  I've got it.  You got it.  You got to let me sleep.  You got to let me sleep.  She would start an argument at that time?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two in the morning.  Holy fuck.  You got.  And I'd be like, you don't understand this.  You got to get.  You got to let me sleep. 
[01:38:30]  Holy fuck.  No, we got to fucking resolve this shit right now.  I'm fucking.  It's two in the morning.  Could you just please, please?  I'm begging.  Look, I'm begging.  I'm begging.  Would you be a little bug?  Shut up.  And a little.  Fucking.  Damn it.  I just hear horrible things and smell Jack Daniels.  But I would assume that you never really settled the issue, huh?  Nope.  Nope.  It was so.  It would have been so easy to just take my fist and roundhouse or off of the bed like that. 
[01:39:00]  Did you ever like viscerally feel your fist?  Like what it would feel like to punch her?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I imagined it so many times, but I just know where that leads to.  You can't do it.  No, it leads to domestics and then you get your guns down the way.  And then also you're the problem.  Yeah.  That was long before you had guns.  You're the.  Well, yeah.  But I wanted them.  I really thought you had a cell phone in Boston.  No.  Wow.  No, I didn't have a cell phone until I left.  We were in New York for a year at that point. 
[01:39:30]  It wasn't until I fucking left that house.  Left her ass there.  Wow.  I went out and the first thing I did was buy a cell phone.  Wow.  Okay, right.  Got one now.  Wah, wah, wah.  Wow.  God, that was just a nightmare.  It's terrible.  Oh, was she the worst?  And they never stopped being a bitch.  That's the problem.  That was constant.  It doesn't change.  It just doesn't change.  There's nothing worse than a woman that can't stop being a fucking bitch.  No.  It's like, shut the fuck up.  It's a raggy, naggy hag.  God almighty.  You want to pay for your own shit, idiot. 
[01:40:00]  Go ahead.  Take the garbage out.  You're home all day.  How about you take the garbage out?  Because that's not my job.  What?  Who doled out the jobs?  Wait, she said it wasn't my job?  Yeah, yeah.  But who agreed on the jobs?  Here's my idea of the jobs.  I go to work and bring home a lot of money.  You stay home and do every fucking thing.  There.  Even Steven.  Take out the garbage.  No.  Feed the cats. 
[01:40:30]  It's your job.  Are we talking?  They ain't even my fucking cats.  If we're talking about this shit, my favorite thing is when we were all holed up in your mother-in-law's house.  Yeah.  Where she went to her mom's house every day after she was done with her little job.  Yeah.  And what drove me nuts watching your hell was you, and I had my own hell.  I'm not sitting here like saying I was perfect, but we're not talking about me right now.  Then you would have to go there to get her because she didn't drive. 
[01:41:00]  No.  And then you had to literally wait until she was ready to go home.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because they would sit and watch their videotaped soap operas.  It wasn't bad enough that, you know, you drove friends.  It wasn't bad enough you drove past where you lived to go get her every day.  Yeah.  And maybe get her quickly and go home so you could maybe enjoy your night.  Right.  You had to, and I was living there at the time, so I saw this going down.  Obviously, it was like, I'm done with my day.  I want to go fucking home.  But you had to sit there and wait until she was ready. 
[01:41:30]  And there they were.  First, I had to watch the entire hour of Days of Our Lives.  Then the entire hour of General Hospital.  That's three hours, right?  And then Friends would come on.  So it was two and a half, three hours.  Every day.  No joke.  Every day.  Why did they watch the tapes?  Every fucking day.  Why did they watch them live?  Why did they watch them videotaped?  Because I guess they were both doing things.  They were working.  The mother was working.  She was working at some liquor store for a little while.  And then I would pop by because I had to pick her up. 
[01:42:00]  I couldn't just go home.  Like, I just wanted to go home and hang out, watch TV, whatever, go on the computer.  Do your own thing.  And shit like that.  But I had to go there because she couldn't get a mile.  And it was one mile from the mother-in-law's house to my apartment.  Couldn't get the one mile back to the house by herself.  I had to fucking drive there.  Did you ever tell her I don't want to do this?  What, Jimmy?  Oh, you couldn't do that?  Now you're talking some kind of crazy talk.  Is that crazy talk?  How about another fucking 10 or 12 hours of utter and complete hell if I did that?  And you might be confused because you would think, well, why doesn't Ann go home for three 
[01:42:30]  hours and then finally get her?  There was some weird thing where she would get mad if you weren't there.  What are you doing?  Why aren't you?  It was easier for me to just go there and just pour out huge tumblers of Jack Daniels  and Captain Morgan and whatever I felt like that day and just top it off with a splash  of cola and down those at the rate of probably four an hour.  Would you be watching these shows? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  I would kind of just sit down on the couch.  Just fucking zone out?  Yeah.  And zone out.  I'm just looking around.  And then I'd go upstairs and there was only one TV.  So unless I wanted to go into the mother-in-law's room and watch TV in there.  But there were like three channels.  No.  You weren't.  I mean.  I know.  I really had to.  I'm sorry to say this to you.  Why aren't you hanging out with me and mom?  Yeah, you really weren't allowed to do that.  Just a pussy-whipped faggot.  You didn't want to hang out with her and mom?  No.  It would be.  Ever.  It would be 10, 10.30, 11 o'clock and they finally would leave every day. 
[01:43:30]  Oh my God.  Every day.  And then his night's fucked at that point.  Yeah.  More or less.  I wanted to go down to the bar in Ashland, grab a couple of beers, talk to real people.  Men.  People are calling you a pussy, but the problem is.  It was a pussy.  No, but the problem is, and I think a lot of guys could relate, certainly, you feel trapped.  I was trapped in my stupid relationship way too long.  Yeah.  All of a sudden you don't even know how to fucking get out of it.  You're like, you sit there one day and go, how the fuck did I get here?  Yeah.  Now how the fuck do I get out? 
[01:44:00]  I should have gotten out of it a lot sooner.  We all would.  There's a million people that would say that today.  I'm not fucking people.  But whatever.  It happened.  That's what it was.  I was quite the pussy-whipped faggot because I just was trying to keep away from confrontation.  And from keeping away from confrontation, it was ten times worse than the confrontation because it was more protracted.  If you get a one week of shit that maybe if you would have jumped on it and got the nuclear shit out of the way for one day, you wouldn't have to deal with a week's worth of shit. 
[01:44:30]  But I didn't put it in those terms.  And be fair about this.  Yes.  When should you have gotten out?  Because I know when I should have gotten out of mine.  Yeah.  I should have gotten out right before we went to Boston.  I should have ditched her in fucking New York.  How many years were you married at that point?  Maybe five.  95 we went up there.  Yeah.  Like five years.  Five years?  And then you lasted another?  Five.  Almost.  Five.  I should have just ditched her right in New York and said, stay here. 
[01:45:00]  I'm fucking going to Boston.  My huge mistake, I moved mine up, but she didn't want to go at first.  Yeah.  Sorry that I have a much better gig and there's opportunities for everybody up there.  I'm sorry.  She finally got up there.  And then she ended up falling in love with Boston.  And we were up there, what, three years?  Yeah.  And then I should have left her up there.  And then I lasted another four years.  You brought her up.  It was so fucking obvious that it was over.  Yeah.  And she had a good job up there and then she's crying hysterically as we're going through 
[01:45:30]  the tolls, listening to the radio station, me and you were going to fucking just take  over.  Yeah.  And she's crying.  I'm like, are you serious?  This is an amazing opportunity.  You get to move back home.  It's like, then stay up there.  Just stay up there.  Aren't they annoying fucking women?  But my problem is that's where I blew it.  It was perfect to move on at that point.  And I didn't.  And I lasted another four.  You lasted five.  I lasted four.  Four years, I didn't want to do that shit anymore. 
[01:46:00]  Terrible.  It's almost like sometimes you wonder, it's like, you want everything paid for and you  want, and it's like, great, that's cool.  And you get it and you have a decent life.  Just shut the, sometimes all they have to do is shut the fuck up.  But they're obviously not happy.  It's like, what do they want?  Well, I don't know.  If you're not happy, then fucking say something and leave.  Leave.  Leave.  You know, if you're not happy and you stay, then you're staying for one fucking reason.  They like the perks.  And that's money.  And the perks.  Right.  Yeah, she should have never came back with me to New York. 
[01:46:30]  I never should have taken her up to Boston.  I never should have fucked trannies.  I was like, ha, ha, ha.  At one point, we're on a ski slope.  And she looks at me.  She goes, you hate me, don't you?  And I wish I, I wish.  Did you just wish down the mountain?  I wish I answered that question that day.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  I didn't.  What'd you say?  I don't remember.  You're like, oh, what do you think?  What do you mean?  I kind of avoided it, I guess.  But she fucking nailed it.  I was done at that point.  Done. 
[01:47:00]  I never met Antichick.  I'm so blind, dude.  I was around you and your girl a lot.  I had no idea.  Yeah, because it wasn't like, you know, she avoided all fucking conflict.  But I mean, even the vibe.  We couldn't even work on, you know, shit when maybe it would have mattered.  Maybe.  I don't know.  I'm well, I'm so far past that.  I don't even know anymore.  And the thing is, my fucking disaster was into girls, too.  What?  She was into girls.  So the whole thing before, before I even was able to like, hey, you know, I'm in the radio  and let's hook something up or something. 
[01:47:30]  She was already dragging girls over.  Why is that a problem?  Mine was not into girls and not into men.  I'm just saying like that.  So it wasn't like I should have, I should have saved the marriage because like, you  know, there wasn't any infidelity going on or anything.  There were all kinds of shenanigans going on.  I don't give a shit.  There were already shenanigans.  What do you mean you didn't give a shit?  Like you.  Like it was one of those things where it was like, like things got kind of wild up in,  not really in Boston, but once we got back to New York, things got pretty wild. 
[01:48:00]  But they were wild before that.  It wasn't like, oh, that, that spelt a doom.  For the, for the institution of marriage.  No, it had already happened.  It was like, you know, kind of a thing.  So it wasn't like, you know, oh, this, the sacred sanctity of this fucking thing.  Would you be looking forward to backing other girls?  Of course.  Oh my God.  It was great.  There's one girl who used to work at the same bar.  She worked at. 
[01:48:30]  Oh my God.  We had a gig one night.  I was fucking playing a gig and comes over and says she wants to come back with us too.  I'm like, okay, I'm hammered.  I'm driving fucking home, just trying not to get pulled over.  I swear I'd have probably fucking, I'd have probably been responsible for killing a police  officer if I would have gotten pulled over that night.  I'm like, I am going home.  I don't care what you say.  I drove like a saint.  You would beg and I'm like, you see what I got here.  You see what's happening here, officer?  Please.  You understand, right, sir?  Please let me go home. 
[01:49:00]  When you're not in your uniform, you understand this shit, right?  You know this.  You understand this.  And you know this.  It's in your DNA, sir.  So you got them home?  Yeah.  And one was hotter than the one?  Well, one was my fucking wife.  Who the hell wants that?  Did you want to fuck the other one more?  Yes.  That's all I wanted to do.  And then you got to lean over with your hand and like acknowledge the fucking wife.  Would you have to fake attention to the wife while you're banging the other one?  Of course.  Of course.  Like, oh, I'm giving a bad finger job like a fucking ninth grader to the wife. 
[01:49:30]  Meanwhile, I'm fucking exquisitely fucking the new chick.  Would you have been sad if the wife went downstairs and watched TV?  I'd have loved it.  Get out of here.  Usually the best part was she would normally drink so much that she would pass out.  And then when she passed out, me and the other girl would just, you know,  continue for the rest of the night.  Oh, you would actually just keep fucking them?  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Why not?  Were you guys fucking quiet or no?  No, it didn't even have to be.  She would pass out to the point where she fucking, a bomb could go off. 
[01:50:00]  But wait, you would do it in the same bed or you'd just go upstairs?  No, we'd like go on the floor or something.  Right next to the bed?  No, I didn't like the living room.  Did she ever wake up and go, what the fuck?  No, never.  It's so hot.  Never.  But she used to always, there was that caveat, she would always be like, remember, I don't  want anything going on unless, you know, it's all three of us and stuff.  It's like, oh, okay, no problem.  You're like, yeah, of course.  So she'd go to take a shower.  Wham, wham, wham, wham.  During the shower. 
[01:50:30]  And the other girls went for it?  Yeah.  That's great.  Always.  It's great.  I gotta write something down.  Fucking perfect.  Pretty fucking hot, man.  Oh, it was fucking, it was great.  There was a time over at a fucking friend's house out on Long Island.  And this other girl, and we just, we took a bunch of tables and chairs and blankets and  made like a fort and just fucking fucked in the fort.  Who, you and the other girl?  Yes.  Where was the wife?  Ah, passed out.  Pressed out somewhere.  How was the bang?  It was great.  Did you wear a condom?  It was brand new. 
[01:51:00]  Half of it.  You pulled it off.  Jesus.  I don't know where it went.  I remember that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can I say it?  Negotiations.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  It's like I was selling a new car.  The day that Ant shows me a picture and goes, I'm bringing this picture home to start negotiations.  Start negotiations.  Now, look at this.  Sure, how would you like to ride in this beauty?  You had a picture of a girl that you wanted to fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  And you said, okay, I could. 
[01:51:30]  Yep.  And he goes to me, I'm bringing it home.  I'll be like, I know.  I know she's into it.  Because she was into girls.  You know?  She was into it?  Yeah.  She said she was like, she goes, I think I'm like 40% lesbian and 60% straight.  I'm like, all right.  That's borderline, man.  I'll take the 40%.  So then why would she give a fuck about you and her?  Because there was a whole other thing.  You can't just say because that's happening, this will happen, you know? 
[01:52:00]  Because that was happening is one thing.  But she also had this weird thing in her head that this marriage was fucking, you know, precious.  She had an unnatural connection, too.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because it seems like she would almost throw all that by the wayside to go have some fun.  I was just in it for the broads.  I was just married for the broads.  That's pretty much it.  Wow.  Just liked, you know.  Did she give good head, at least?  Who, the wife?  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah, it actually wasn't too shabby.  Not that.  Do you ever jerk off to her?  Never.  Oh, God.  What is that?  That would just go away instantly.  Oh, God.  But is there anything, like, you could look back out and go, that was kind of hot that  time?  Like, that moment?  Can you picture?  Actually, the only time I could picture it really being even remotely hot, with all the  shit that's gone on in between, it kind of put a damper on everything, was the, like,  very beginning, when I just used to pop by your house every so often, before it was a 
[01:53:00]  relationship or anything, you know?  Just to go over there and just fucking...  But the night of your wedding, you knew you made a terrible mistake.  It was horrid.  I know.  She had gotten into fights with my mother, with my brother, just yelling and drunk.  Isn't that amazing?  And then she's passed out.  And they're going, oh, this is great.  I don't even get to consummate.  Be careful.  You might be having phone sex with Jimmy soon.  Oh, that's okay.  I got a full ride, but that's medically induced. 
[01:53:30]  Be careful.  It's borderline.  I'm just watching out for you.  I love hearing this.  Jimmy Coors didn't turn mad at his phone sex yesterday on our show.  I'm convinced of it.  I love this stuff.  Ah, it was fucking great.  It's so interesting.  Fun.  Fun stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck.  All right.  People's relationships falling apart is really interesting.  Isn't it?  Yeah, because we've all had them.  You know, like, I've had them.  The destruction of a relationship.  And what you don't see on the outside. 
[01:54:00]  Like, hearing it from that point of view, it's like, you never would know that just hanging  out, like, all those fucking hellacious nights.  And that's just a lifetime ago.  Oh, it is.  It's like, I can't barely remember.  I have no.  I have no connection to that anymore.  None.  You know what I mean?  Emotion.  Nothing.  And that was like a big part of my life for so fucking long.  It's like a lifetime ago.  That's a different person.  Yeah.  I can't even imagine.  I can't imagine that I hung in there as long as I did in my situation.  I am amazed I stayed in it that long. 
[01:54:30]  And again, I was always trying to fucking wheel out.  When we went up to Boston, we've talked about this many times.  It's just I was on a constant fucking pussy hunt.  I could give a shit.  I did not give one flying fuck about my fucking wife.  We were so close to pussy at all times.  All times.  Were there any beer girls that you wanted to fuck with?  Oh, all of them.  All of them.  With the braces?  The beer girls, the Kahlua girls, the fucking...  Don't forget the post office Rocco live broadcast. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, it did.  Yeah.  We had some lap dancing going on in the back of the rock bus.  But, you know.  It was so close to having pussy at all times.  Then always in the back of the head would be this shit.  But why?  I don't know.  What was I sacrificing?  Right?  I don't get it sometimes.  It was nothing.  Yeah, but you got to look at, like, you might have fucked up and had a kid early.  That's true.  Like, it's easy to look back and go, I should have done this.  But you might have done it one night with a fairly hot chick. 
[01:55:30]  Had a kid that was fucked up.  She might have put on 40 pounds.  Like, it might have worked out worse.  Or you might have just had a great night getting laid.  Or you might have fucked a tight asshole that milked your dick like a fucking shit-coated glove.  But I'm the protection-wearing kid.  I wasn't going to get any fucking girls pregnant.  Yeah, that was funny.  No fucking way.  Might have, bro.  Shit going close.  Yeah, it might have gripped your cock like a fucking, like a worm.  Like, picture a worm opening up and just grabbing your cock velvety. 
[01:56:00]  Velvety.  Velvety?  Yeah, not even rough shit, but smooth, silky shit.  Oh, God damn.  When I think about all the fucking girls that we could have fucking had, man.  Well.  And we just, and then going home every day with some weird fucking attitude thing in the air.  Some fucking problem.  The attitude is no worse, man.  It's not even fucking the same person.  It was always just there, wishy-washy.  It wasn't even like an actual fucking thing.  You could put a finger on it. 
[01:56:30]  How bad is this?  What's wrong?  Ugh.  I know something's wrong.  See, just tell me.  I can't tell you.  Nothing.  I can't tell you how many times I just beat the shit out of my steering wheel because  I was so frustrated that this person would not fucking talk and tell me what the fuck  is the problem.  I wish mine would have shut the fuck up.  See?  It was complete opposite.  But that worked.  Oh, oh.  Shut the fuck up.  Aunt's wife never had a problem telling it what the problem was, and mine never fucking spoke. 
[01:57:00]  Dude, do you remember also, do you remember when she would tell a story?  It would go on forever.  She was a good storyteller?  Oh, God.  It would go.  Every little bit of minutia, the fucking, things that didn't matter would come into the story.  It was.  The color of the fucking tire.  It was the classic drinking babble.  Yes.  You know, when you have a few in you, you kind of maybe over-explain things.  So what happened today at work?  Well, uh, this guy, uh, liquor salesman came in, uh, his name's, uh, Bill, Bill, Bob, Bill, 
[01:57:30]  Bill.  And, uh, he pulled up in the truck.  You've seen it before, that white truck with the red lettering on it.  Have you seen that?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's that truck.  And, uh, you know, it's got a trailer hitch on it.  And I don't know why.  I've never seen him haul it.  Shut up!  Would you get bored?  I would, I would start, my eyes are darting back and forth like a fucking crackhead where  I, I was trying to find a way out. 
[01:58:00]  My fight or flight reflex actually clicked in during one of her stories.  Would she ever start talking in front of people and you'd get embarrassed?  Like, oh, fuck you.  Constantly.  Constantly.  I'd have to, like, turn away or, or make a loud noise to punctuate them.  But, like, ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, you, you, you'd have to make a, enable  our fucking conversation.  I, I think we were successful because we were in bad relationships, by the way.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'm convinced of that. 
[01:58:30]  We dove in headfirst into work.  And we weren't willing to fucking, uh, you know, start fooling around and really fuck  up our personal lives.  Yeah.  We just kept that status quo, which meant, you know, we wanted to stay away from our houses,  which allowed us to spend more time working on our fucking radio show at the time.  I really believe that's one of the things.  Absolutely.  One of the reasons.  Who wanted to go home?  Ended up being successful.  God, the one joy I had was playing fucking Half-Life.  Get home and play Half-Life on the computer.  It was, like, one of the first real first person shooter games that, like, had an immersive 
[01:59:00]  story.  And for the time, the graphics were unbelievable.  And I fucking was fully immersed.  Just wanted to play this game and finish it.  It had a beginning, a middle, and an end.  It's going to end soon.  Don't worry.  But, boy, any time I jumped on that computer and was having a good goddamn fuck time, that  fuck would come over and, what are you doing on the computer?  Spend some time.  Sit here.  What?  And watch Dharma and Greg with you?  Yeah, watch Dharma.  She loved it! 
[01:59:30]  Fuck!  That could be one of the worst shows ever.  It was horrible!  Wait, when would you be talking to a group of people and she would start with a story and  you'd be like, oh, you fuck.  Oh, and a party at the bar at, like, Holiday in Vance.  Jimmy's not past the story.  I can't get over that.  I think she would start telling stories.  Oh!  And she had to have these big, long, fucking fake fingernails.  And they were giant, like, clickety-clackety giant.  And it was just for the attention.  So people would be like, oh, nails! 
[02:00:00]  Yeah!  I get them done at this place in Huntington.  This girl, Barbara.  Barbara?  Is it?  Barbara.  Barbara, she does it.  It's right off of Main Street.  And you make a left.  And then, no, no.  Actually, a right.  The taco place is on.  Have you ever been to that place?  It's so good.  They make the best Mexican food.  Oh, she babbles.  And you're like, and I swear, I'm not even, like, exaggerating.  It would go like this.  And I'd sit there and go like, ha ha, yeah.  So the nails?  The nails?  And I have to get her back on track. 
[02:00:30]  You had to co-dependently get her back on track.  Without me seeming like I'm trying to, because then she'd get mad at me.  Because you were humiliated for yourself and everyone who was listening.  Horribly.  Oh, no.  Oh, it was so bad, Jimmy.  That's terrible.  It was horrible.  We used to do a lot of dinners back then.  And she would speak.  She would talk the entire fucking time.  And me and Ann would just look at each other.  I just wouldn't shut up.  We would just look at each other like.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But we already talked a lot that day.  So it didn't matter that much, I guess.  Yeah. 
[02:01:00]  Wait, but Darm and Gray.  Darm and Greg.  Darm and Greg, right.  Okay, so I would almost understand if you're obsessive about your video game and your wife  or your girl wants to do something else.  Right.  But then to pull, and I'm saying almost.  Yeah, yeah, I understand.  In all fairness.  Yeah.  But then she pulls you away from something you're really enjoying so you could sit down  and watch this shitty show.  And, by the way.  How is that quality time is what I'm getting at. 
[02:01:30]  Sit down and resent her now.  Right.  Now I'm not only watching a shitty show.  Right.  But if I was in good company, I'd goof on the shitty show.  But why wouldn't you just continue watching your video game?  I know.  I asked this.  I know.  Because, oh boy.  Oh boy.  Would it have been a fucking disaster.  Did you ever tell her, like, why don't you watch that dumb show?  I'm busy.  Shut up.  What?  Are you crazy?  That would have been crazy.  Oh, yeah.  Are you crazy?  What?  She was intimidating, Jimmy.  And she hated.  She was fucking intimidating.  The word cunt. 
[02:02:00]  She hated that word more than anything ever.  So I would use it as an atomic bomb every so often.  Very rarely.  But usually, chicken shitty under my breath.  She'd be upstairs.  She'd go upstairs.  You fucking asshole.  You asshole.  And I'd be like, fucking cunt.  I.  What?  And I'd hear, what?  What did you say?  I used to, if we're going to be fair here, I actually liked her when she was sober.  And then there was this thing where I went. 
[02:02:30]  I didn't.  Well, but I didn't.  You didn't?  I wasn't married to her.  But I mean, she was pleasant enough when she was sober.  But then there was always, there was always a timing issue with me when, when the beer  started flowing and then you guys would go with the shots.  Yeah.  And you could never fucking tell, especially back then, when he was fucking drunk.  Your personality.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, I'm serious.  Your personality kept like, like this.  You know?  Amazing.  Yeah.  And, but hers, you would watch the personality start changing in front of your eyes.  Her face would shift. 
[02:03:00]  It would be like, kind of smiling and everything.  And her eyebrows are up.  And her eyes are open.  And then it turned into this, one half of the mouth would go down.  Her eyebrows would go down.  Her eyes would be half-masked.  And she'd get this furrow.  This furrow above her nose.  And it would just be like, fuck you.  Yeah, pure evilness would just come out.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I'm serious.  Between one shot.  Huh?  Within one shot.  Like, she could have five shots.  Right.  And the fucked up thing is, it would, it would vary. 
[02:03:30]  Like, I could count the shots and go, oh, next one's going to be the one.  It would be like, three shots and then the fourth one puts her over the top.  Or it could be six.  And we were all.  And the seventh one.  But it was one that she'd go from zero to fucking 60.  With one more.  And we had a whole night's worried about that, right?  Oh, yes.  And I used to have talks with her before we went out.  Right.  And say, please.  I go, please, look, we're talking right now.  Everything's cool.  Yeah, everything's cool.  When we go out, I know you're going to be drinking and stuff, but could you just remember 
[02:04:00]  this moment?  I go, remember this very moment.  And when I remind you of it, please remember this.  That no, nothing's wrong.  We don't have any problems between us.  Oh, I know.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry.  And she'd have the shots.  And then she'd be like, fucking asshole.  And I'd be like, there's no problem here.  I remember when, fuck you, what you remember, shit.  And there was no reason.  No reason.  Jimmy, it was unbelievable.  No fight.  And you would watch a change in front of your eyes.  The stress of that.  And I always knew I had maybe an hour.  I was in that world for an hour, maybe two. 
[02:04:30]  And then, you know, obviously I'd go home.  Yeah.  And then thinking, oh, fuck, this isn't going to end.  If I just would have waited another hour to take her to the hospital during that ectopic  pregnancy, just waited one more fucking hour.  Did you ever actually think that?  Oh, yeah.  During the divorce, I did.  One more hour.  That would have saved you a lot, huh?  Yeah.  Certainly would have. 
[02:05:00]  But Anthony was all ooh at that time.  It was early on, too.  So I didn't have that animosity yet.  So I rushed a ride to the hospital.  Of course.  Animosity.  But, yeah.  Oh, God.  That would have been something.  Just a, hey, don't worry about it.  Go to bed.  It hurts now, but it'll go away.  Just watching the fallopian tube go off like a sprinkler hose. 
[02:05:30]  But you would have to.  I'm amazed.  Like, I've been in those codependent ones.  Oh, yeah.  Like, where you watch the drinker start.  But never, like, that long.  And that's amazing to me to have the pressure of that.  It's fucking.  Constant.  To the approval.  Like, oh, please.  To making it all okay.  Like, oh, it's such work.  It's a constant game and job.  It's a constant job of keeping or thinking you're keeping everybody from finding out the truth. 
[02:06:00]  You know?  All the people that are hanging around.  All of my coworkers, friends, family, things like that.  I'm constantly fucking juggling and spinning plates to try to keep everyone from knowing what's really happening.  Would you ever be humiliated by her like that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, fucking one time with Brucey Mittman at the bar at one of our appearances.  Well, she might have been laying, actually, next to the bar. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, right.  She was on the floor, laying on the floor next to the bar.  That's right.  Laid into our Halloween party.  Yeah, she was asleep on the floor.  Granted, everyone was drinking.  But see what.  I mean, Ant, you know, Ant would go drink for drink with her.  But his personality wouldn't change.  It really wouldn't change.  Yeah, it was quite amazing.  To see a person's personality change that drastically within a dinner was just unbelievable.  Mr. Hyde.  Ant winds up getting a little louder, and he repeats himself.  Yes.  But he doesn't turn into a dick.  I just like fun.  I know he's drunk, but he's not a dick. 
[02:07:00]  I just like fun.  And that, Anthony, that takes a lot, too.  Yeah.  I'm talking a few drinks, pretty much.  Pretty much fucking the same.  So wait, she was laying on the floor while your boss was there?  Laying on the floor, and there's my boss.  Wait, Anthony, what's with your wife?  Up against the bar.  The bar at this point was, you know, not as many people.  What's with the wife?  I'm like, yeah, I know.  Come on, get up.  You got to get up.  Blah!  Oh, she didn't want to get up?  No.  You had to put her over your shoulder?  Blah!  No, I didn't that time. 
[02:07:30]  I just got him picked up by the arm and threw her on the fucking bar stool.  And she said, you know, chill out.  And Bruce, he went backstage to try to find pot that he could smoke with young women.  Yes.  Yes.  All right, Bruce.  Let's relax.  You had your issues, too.  What's worse than a chick that starts shit with other people?  Yeah, she would do that.  Isn't that terrible?  Just starts shit with other people.  Fuck you.  You're a fucking asshole.  Oh, God.  I'm sunk.  Hey, when a chick mumbles to another man. 
[02:08:00]  Patrice talked about this one time when he was in there.  About a chick that will mumble or say something to another man.  And then you're supposed to step in.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's like, what are you doing?  I don't know.  And it's because they know they're not going to get hit.  Yeah.  By the way, Patrice, so many people are tweeting me, and now they're getting mad.  I don't have an update.  Yeah.  We don't know.  I'm not avoiding.  We wish we did.  I guess I'm avoiding the tweets because I don't have an update.  And now people are really fucking mad that I'm not getting back to them.  Well, here's your update. 
[02:08:30]  I don't have any updates.  We've talked to his girl.  We don't know.  I mean, it's a slow process.  Yeah, please don't get mad at me.  It's not a broken ankle.  This thing is killing us.  But I don't have an update.  The day when these guys announce it on the radio, that's all I know to this day.  That's all I know.  Yeah, so I'm glad you said that because I get the same thing.  And I'm not trying to not tell people.  It's not like I have inside information like, oh, this is exactly where we just don't know.  It's very frustrating for all of us.  You think you guys are frustrated? 
[02:09:00]  He's one of my best friends.  We all love him.  It's frustrating.  You're even closer, though, obviously.  But I'm saying we are dealing with that, too.  It's not like just the fans are.  Right.  We want to know as well.  It fucking sickens me every day, to be completely honest with you.  It's horrible.  I get sick to my stomach over it.  But we don't have an update.  Nothing.  Nothing.  Wish we did.  I love those Boston stories.  It goes, nice change of topic.  Other one is like, oh, I don't know which stories are more tragic. 
[02:09:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, those Boston days were just a blur to me.  I can't get enough of Ant's marriage.  The best of times and the worst of times.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got the best stories.  I mean.  Any time we could get the fuck away, it was golden.  Me, you fucking.  Jay.  Jay.  We'd fucking just take off and hit a bar.  And it was like, great.  The bitches aren't here.  We could just hang out and laugh our asses off without worrying about some inane interruption. 
[02:10:00]  God, that would have been a great gig if we were just single.  Oh, can you imagine?  No.  I think people listening to us right now love the fact that we weren't getting enough.  Oh, I know.  It was just this giant cock block machine that was running.  Constantly there.  Damn.  What idiots.  We're fucking idiots.  There was no reason not to.  No.  We weren't risking anything in the end.  I know. 
[02:10:30]  It was all for naught.  Imagine like we went skinny dipping.  We go back to the skinny dipping story.  With the Kahlua girls.  We come home smelling like seaweed.  Yep.  What was the worst thing that was going to happen?  They were going to pack their bags together and go back to New York.  Which means more skinny dipping.  Hallelujah.  That would have been great.  We're fucking dickheads.  Oh.  And a divorce at the rate I was making in fucking Boston would have been.  That would have been nice. 
[02:11:00]  You should have been rubbing the seaweed on your body.  I know.  Make sure.  Believe me stripper sparkles on my head before I go home.  Everything.  Right.  Fucking whore perfume.  See in the end.  Lipstick.  I just should have gone to the drugstore.  Gotten lipstick.  And drawn a circle around my fucking ball bag and dick.  Yeah.  What?  Oh shit.  Yeah.  I guess so.  Would you ever be talking to a chick in a bar when she was there and like you thought  it was going to go somewhere but then she fucked it up?  Dude.  I couldn't even get that close.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was it. 
[02:11:30]  I got the best chick story.  One day, and I guess it was based on your wife, we all agreed to go to a strip club.  What strip club?  Tens?  Tens Show Club.  So we go in and I'm like, oh, this is going to be fucking kind of cool and a little different.  You know, my girl, she agrees to this.  We go in and then she's staring at me to make sure I'm not looking at anybody.  So then I start staring at a beer tap.  I remember this like it was yesterday.  Yeah.  Because I didn't want to deal with it.  I'm like, why the fuck are we here then? 
[02:12:00]  Why are we in the strip club then?  Meanwhile, she's flirting legitimately with a guy at Mother Anne as the fucking waiter.  Oh, she flirted with a lot of guys.  Holy shit.  And I was a good looking fucking guy, man.  You still are.  I was a good looking fucking guy.  What do you mean, we're still are?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And I was just like, if I ever met one.  I know Mother Anne's guy, openly she flirted with.  Yeah.  The drummer for the Nixons.  All right.  Every time the Nixons came to town, she just loved the Nixons. 
[02:12:30]  But it turned out she was in love with the drummer.  Yeah.  And when openly flirt while me and everyone else is standing there.  And that's like real shit.  That is real shit.  And strip clubs is nothing.  Did you say anything though?  Like, what the fuck are you doing?  Like, afterwards at least?  It's so long ago, I wasn't happy.  But it was just like, it was just this fucking place I was in.  I was lame too, man.  And then we went to Turks and Caicos.  And one of the fucking Cirque du Soleil guys was out with her to all hours of the night. 
[02:13:00]  Who were you?  I was tired, so I went home early.  And she's like talking to the guy outside my room.  And I open the door.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Oh, he walked me home.  Was that the fucking trapeze guy?  Yeah, the trapeze guy.  How do you compete with a trapeze guy?  I had a beer belly back then.  We're upside down with our beer belly fat in our own faces.  On purpose.  He made us look foolish.  Yeah, how do we compete with that shit?  I was scared to go up the tiny little ladder.  And she's like, oh, look at his muscles.  He's like, come on up here. 
[02:13:30]  We show you how to do the trapeze.  And we're like, oh, okay.  And he got these bad shorts on.  He's wearing the big bulge, cock bulge fucking tights.  And we go up there with these bad cutoffs.  And he's like, grab on and spin your leg over top.  And then you go down.  And I'm hanging by one arm and one leg.  My yam bag is falling out.  Yeah.  And then, you know, it looked like a hanging.  It didn't even look like I was as graceful as a hanging. 
[02:14:00]  What ends up happening, then the trapeze guy pretty much got to save you because you're  scared shitless because you've never done this shit before.  Just drop onto the net.  And then, you know, fast forward a few hours later when we're all hanging out.  Of course, that was like, of course, that's a turn on to our women.  Yeah.  So all of a sudden, they're just talking to the trapeze guy.  Where were you with the trapeze guy after that?  Like, you guys didn't just leave?  Where did you go that he was still with you guys?  It was Club Med.  So, I mean, it was a big, big, big round.  Always happy, fuck family. 
[02:14:30]  Always a fucking round.  And then, of course, I'm like, well, fuck.  Nothing's going on here.  So I'm like, fuck, I'm going to sleep.  All right.  I'm going to stay out a little while.  And how many hours later did he?  And then I learned that she was pen-palling the guy after we got back to Boston.  Oh, boy.  I learned that.  Do you think anything happened while they were there?  I don't know.  You think they fooled her out?  I don't know.  I got absolute fucking suspicions.  But I don't have any info. 
[02:15:00]  Would she have banged him and then talked in front of the room?  That's a little weird.  She probably, I don't know.  You think she'd blow him?  No, no.  Jerked him off?  No, man.  I don't think she was into any of that shit.  So they were pen pals writing or emailing?  Maybe not with you.  This was before the email.  How'd you find out?  I found out.  The letter came or something.  Yeah.  Oh, you saw one of his letters?  Oh, boy.  Was it inappropriate or was it?  No, I didn't read the fucking letter.  I'm like, what the fuck is this about?  Oh, we're just, you know, we're just keeping in touch.  Yeah.  Keeping in touch. 
[02:15:30]  Why?  As he's a trapeze guy around the world.  And I'm some fucking shock jock about to blow up my spot.  Yeah.  About to be fired.  About to be an unemployed shock jock.  I should have went and fucking joined the circus.  You didn't ask to read the letter?  This is so many years ago, I don't remember.  Oh, I would have asked to read it.  No.  I think I was like kind of in an ant's boat where I didn't want a fucking deal.  Yeah.  I was lame, I'm telling you.  But then if it's not a bad letter, you apologize.  Obviously, she wasn't into me.  She's openly flirting with the drummer from the Nixons, the guy from Mother Anna's, the fucking trapeze guy. 
[02:16:00]  And then, of course, even the Blacker the Night guy from Clubman.  Oh, yeah.  Hendel.  Hendel.  Hendel, man.  Our women loved Hendel.  It's all good, man.  Oh, boy, do they love Hendel.  Hendel, it's all good.  God damn, do they love Hendel.  Hendel was skewering every girl that fucking went down there.  He was one of those shiny black guys.  Oh, was he shiny and pitch black. 
[02:16:30]  Did he have it down, though, the wrap with the chicks?  Oh, everything.  This guy's body was literally solid from head to toe.  He didn't have a hint of a fucking fat cell on him.  He was six, what, four, probably?  That's it.  He could stand against a wall that was painted gloss black and disappear.  Disappear.  But he had a personality on him, man.  What did he do?  Hey, man, he was like the ringleader.  All he did was work girls.  Look at this guy.  That was his job.  Look at this fucking guy.  Everyone knows Hendel.  Anyone that has gone to Club Men and Turks and Caicos in the mid-90s especially knows this fucking guy. 
[02:17:00]  He has a very happy smile.  He looks like a nice guy.  This guy put up numbers, man.  Why wouldn't he?  You can admit he's a good-looking black guy, man.  You think he ever fucked a lot of chicks?  Oh, my God.  So many girls.  He has the long hair.  He looks kind of exotic.  Think they wanted to bang him?  What do you think?  I don't know.  Of course.  You come down with your girl all pasty white from New York City because you're working a real job.  And then you've got this guy that doesn't have a hint of fucking fat on him. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, my ex would not have wanted to fuck him.  Oh, no.  No.  No.  No.  No.  She would have had some choice words for me if I had suggested it.  She don't like those people.  Nah, she's not a big fan of black guys.  Yeah, Hendel is making the rounds.  This guy was knocking back numbers, though, man.  Multiple numbers per week.  Is he still there, do you think?  I don't think so.  I think he went to some other place, and now it's just been years and years.  Oh, okay.  Who knows?  Why are there so many pictures of him online?  Where do you...  Everyone knows him. 
[02:18:00]  He's fucking...  He was the guy.  I'm telling you.  He was one of the main guys at Club Med, especially at Turks and Caicos.  He was like the host of the Club Med at Turks.  Like, he would be the guy that greeted you when you got out of the van.  Was he always smiling?  Always.  Yeah.  It's all good.  It's all good.  Everything was all good.  Just leave your luggage here, man.  Go to your rooms.  Freshen up a bit, and then we'll be out here.  Your bags will be in your place.  And I'm sitting there going, I'm not leaving my fucking bag here with these people.  I would bet a lot of money, I don't know for sure, that this guy was fucking separating 
[02:18:30]  girls while their husbands or boyfriends were on the Club Med property and getting shit  done.  I don't doubt it.  He wasn't just going for the single ones.  Whatever he wanted, he would fucking work.  Any of them.  Yeah, you don't blame him.  I don't blame him.  He's working at Club Med, and he's a fucking single guy.  Yeah.  You don't know these fucking people.  Maybe he didn't ever fraternize with the girls because he felt it was inappropriate  in a work environment.  He's this guy.  You could just see it on his face. 
[02:19:00]  You could see it on his face.  He had a lot of pussy.  Let's say hi to Brian.  Brian.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, so I used to, I taught trapeze in Club Med in like 98 through late 99.  Oh, yeah?  Mm-hmm.  And yeah, I was down there with Hendel.  Oh, you are?  You know Hendel, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's still with the club.  I think he's over in Australia now.  Yeah, why would you ever leave Club Med?  I know. 
[02:19:30]  Why would you ever leave?  Yeah, yeah.  I taught trapeze down there, too.  That was what I did.  Oh.  Yeah, well, you made us look foolish.  I don't think you're the guy that taught us.  Yeah, I don't think you're the guy, either.  Yeah.  But.  No, no, yeah.  I think the guy, was the guy, was he French?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  I think I know him because I was on the team with him when I was down there.  Then I left, came back to the States.  He stayed on, and I actually still keep in touch with him.  I know who he is.  Yeah, how about that? 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  Why don't you forward his fucking email address to Opie's ex?  Yeah.  Whatever.  That guy keeps in touch with everybody.  He just likes to talk to people.  He's lonely.  He certainly does.  I'm too busy hanging upside down.  Yeah.  I was just.  I'm the girl.  Shut up.  I was just stupid.  I learned how to enable from my fucking father.  That's what it comes down to.  We were stupid.  Why take care of your own happiness when you should take care of someone else's and sacrifice  your own?  You know what?  That's what I learned growing up. 
[02:20:30]  Thanks.  Thanks a lot, Dad.  Thank God for the radio show, though, because the radio show was the happy part and the  part we wanted to be at.  I mean, it is.  Excuse me.  And then the relationship part sucked ass, so you wanted to be on the radio part more,  you know?  And I think if I was, I think I'd have ditched the wife if I was knocking tin and putting  up with that aggravation.  But I think the fact that I was doing radio and it was fun kind of made the miserable 
[02:21:00]  relationship thing like second.  I could give a shit about it.  I mean, if you really want to break it down, I was.  I'll speak for myself.  I think I was scared that if I did do the right thing in my personal life, that it could have  fucked up our gigs.  Like, it would have been too much of a distraction and too much, you know what I mean?  Too much shit.  And I just wanted everything to just be fucking status quo because we knew we were on a rocket  ship.  Yeah.  And then I always said to myself, I'll get to that eventually.  Yeah, I'll deal with that.  Eventually.  It was definitely secondary. 
[02:21:30]  I remember one time.  Which is stupid now.  She talked about that whole thing.  It's like, my relationship is secondary to your job.  And I'd have to be like, no, it's not.  Oh, no.  Was it?  Of course it was.  It was secondary.  How about fucking fifth on the list?  Of course it was.  Behind, like, something good to eat now.  Of course it was.  Of course.  Fucking behind Razzles.  What?  That's an old candy.  Oh, Razzles.  I was thinking, stupid me, I'm always thinking rock clubs. 
[02:22:00]  Behind Razzles.  Uh, shit.  Should we take a break?  I'd had it.  Yeah.  Someone called me a cuckold.  Oh.  Eh, what are you going to do?  It's only a cuckold if it kind of turns you on.  Nah, nah, never.  But I'm just saying, that's what a cuckold is.  A guy whose wife flirts.  I, abso-fucking-lutely was lame.  So.  That would annoy me.  I like cuckold stuff.  I think the idea of it can be sexy.  But if someone did that to me for real and flirted, like, if my, that was one thing my ex and I would fire, but she didn't do that. 
[02:22:30]  Like, her faults were, like, not that.  I would have fucking screamed at her.  I can't, I could never handle that.  And probably could speak for it better than me, but it was always, it was always kind of just like a cute thing she did.  But then you wonder, right?  What's that?  When she was flirting.  Oh.  Yeah, you wonder.  Because it was always, it was always kind of like an, there was an innocence about it, so you're like, ah, that's just.  Let me tell you something.  It made me uncomfortable.  There you go.  That time at Mother Anna's, it made me uncomfortable. 
[02:23:00]  Because she was gawking over this guy.  This guy loved her, too.  And this guy was fucking making eye contact with her, and they were, like, making these little smiles and eyes.  Like, I was, I was paying a lot of attention to what was going on, and it was just, it was uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Thanks for telling me so many years later.  Yeah, no problem.  Just like I helped you out.  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks for, fucking, you, you drove me to that fucking place every day that she lived, that house. 
[02:23:30]  What?  You drove me home every day, when, well, you know, every other day.  What, you couldn't have pushed me out on the expressway?  I know, it just did.  Fucking kick me out?  Let me tuck and roll?  Hope for the best?  Man, just leave them behind.  I know.  Give them, give them, give them their own you all.  Any guys out there, if you're thinking about it, just leave.  But how do you move a bad relationship from one state to another?  That's stupid.  That is really dumb.  Think about that.  We dragged that fucking rotting meat of a relationship, both of us had, across a couple of states. 
[02:24:00]  That's dumb.  Do you want to get married again?  And then back again.  Ant, do you want to get married again?  No!  Jimmy's an asshole.  Holy shit!  You never know, though.  I mean...  Everyone says that.  It's like, you know, no, you'll get...  And I've seen these guys that have been married two, three times.  And like, yeah, you ever think you're getting married again?  There's no fucking way.  And they're like, yeah, I was thinking the same thing.  But apparently not the same thing, because you got married again.  If you were thinking the same thing, you would say to yourself, I am never, ever, ever getting married again. 
[02:24:30]  Sorry.  Ain't gonna happen.  I'll fucking...  I'll take my chances lying in a hospice like Joe Frazier with no one around me.  I could give a shit if I have a wife or kids or any of that shit.  Give me fun now!  See, and I always wanted to be married to the right person.  At least, thank God it wasn't that dumb.  Well, you like being married, though.  At least you enjoy it. 
[02:25:00]  I'm up to almost three years.  I'm definitely all in.  I'm loving it.  But, you know...  Thank God I didn't do that shit.  We're a kid.  Oh, God.  How the fuck do you do that after a relationship is busted up?  That I couldn't imagine.  How the fuck do you do that?  I've said it before.  I couldn't imagine having to be in some kind of relationship with her because we had a kid.  I would fucking...  I'd be...  She would still be all over your shit.  In my life, on my shit.  It's like once the divorce thing was over, it was over.  You knew.  There was no connection. 
[02:25:30]  Imagine fucking having to go with a kid and having to see her and deal with her horse shit  and her dumb stories and fucking me still having to pay her money.  Ugh!  I feel really sorry for the people that have to deal with that shit.  Thank God I pulled out.  There's a lot out there, too.  Thank God I was pulling out.  I was fake coming.  I was fake coming in you.  Were you really?  She probably knows right now.  She probably knows.  Good.  Fake coming.  All the doctors we went to that couldn't figure out why you couldn't get pregnant.  Because I wasn't coming in you! 
[02:26:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I saved the cum for the toilet bowl.  You know, the thing I could talk to.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  How great is that?  Fake coming.  Oh, yeah.  I'd shiver and shake and make the cum face.  And then what would you do?  Go jerk off in the toilet?  I'd be like, ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Well, yeah, let me go rinse off.  You didn't want a kid?  No!  Not with her, that's for sure. 
[02:26:30]  I didn't want a kid anyway, but I didn't want one with her.  I think I whacked off more in my 30s than when I was a teenager.  Oh, my God.  So I was just a spanking fool.  Boy, if that little Mac fucking, the first one that Rocco got us, he got us those two Macs  that fell off the truck, if that thing could talk, if that screen was a two-way and could  talk about what it saw, all it would see is me sitting there spanking constantly and  trying to get my sperm count down.  I wasted my...  Dummy came home.  I wasted my good-looking years over a toilet. 
[02:27:00]  Looking at your reflection in the toilet water.  So stupid.  God!  That's why we really need time machines, for real.  Oh, my God.  Go back in time and do it right.  I'd be like, what are you doing?  Right.  Life.  Life.  Life.  Oh, God.  Fake cumming.  That's great.  Yeah, that's true.  Oh, I think I'm ovulating. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, I'm taking my prenatal vitamins.  Ew!  Who the fuck wants to hear that when you're getting blown?  Not me!  But she was talking about her prenatal vitamins that she was taking every day.  Oh, man.  You didn't want her to be the mother of your child?  Ooh!  Boy, even then I knew.  And now, in hindsight, thank.  Thank you, God.  Thank you, God.  for not letting one of those boys smash into that egg and wiggle its little tail and start 
[02:28:00]  that fucking cell-splitting thing.  God, you would fake cum and then go into the bathroom.  That's great.  Jack off.  Come back.  Yeah, that was great.  What's on TV?  Can we take a break?  I have to pee so bad, my body temperature just dropped, and I'm clenching my ass cheeks.  You have coolant.  Look, I got a leak.  If we're breaking, I want to announce something and plug it before we go.  Please make it really quick.  Well, you can run out.  Go! 
[02:28:30]  Go!  I'll plug it and then we'll just come.  Well, obviously, this weekend, I'm at the brokerage in Long Island.  I'm going!  Saturday is sold out.  Nice.  I think Friday's available.  I forgot about that gig.  And we've added a second show for the Borgata.  The first show did sell out.  It said it would.  But it's the January 15th, Sunday, which is, I think, Martin Luther King's birthday weekend,  so almost everybody's off that Monday.  Yes, the Borgata.  Myself, Artie Lang, Doug Stanhope, Dave Attell, the second and final show, because the event 
[02:29:00]  center's not available for late shows, so we can only do two.  Sunday, January 15th, tickets go on sale this Friday at 9 a.m. at theborgata.com.  There will be no pre-sale, because it almost sold out in pre-sale last time, so this time  it's just a public on sale.  Nice.  This Friday morning.  All right.  We'll figure out what to talk about next.  Now loading recent tweets from the Opie and Anthony Show.  Recent tweet from Anthony Cumia.  I smell like strippers. 
[02:29:30]  That stench is like skunk.  I need to bathe in tomato juice.  Follow the Opie and Anthony Show on Twitter at Jim Norton, at Anthony Cumia, and at Opie Radio.  O-N-A-S-U-LINE.

Those you don't used to carry the mail through wind and thunderstorms.  Snow and hay.  Had no dogs and he had no sleds.  But one thought drove him straight ahead.  Go, man.  Go.  I say, Opie, what did you learn? 
[02:31:30]  Series X.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Show.  Show.  Uh, Herman Cain.  Do we have the Jimmy Kimmel clip?  I gotta say.  Yeah.  This is the only show that's gonna tell you the truth.  Herman Cain?  Yeah.  All he was doing was making moves.  Making a move.  All Herman Cain was doing was making a fucking move.  And this Gloria already has to get involved with this shit.  She's the worst.  Obviously, Herman Cain was attracted to this broad from Chicago. 
[02:32:00]  She seems like she's, uh, would have been a looker certainly a few years back.  Absolutely.  She's not that bad looking now.  Yeah.  I guess they're going to some kind of business thing or something.  Yep.  And, uh, all of a sudden he puts her hand on, on her leg.  She's got a skirt.  And she says he moved, moved the hand upwards toward her genitals.  Yeah.  He was making a move and seeing if she was going to go for it or not.  Rubbing her leg a little bit.  Maybe she was tired.  He was helping her out.  Wake her up.  Right.  Hey, you wake up.  Hey, get up there.  That's the curse of being a guy.  You got to make the moves. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  We got to make the moves.  And sometimes, and then, and then this broad waits 14 years and all of a sudden it's a problem.  Yeah.  Fuck her.  Also, the second she said, like, no, you know, this isn't fucking working like this,  he backed right off.  Right.  He didn't go any further.  He didn't, you know, no rapes.  So why is Gloria Allred getting involved?  Because she's a cunt.  Yeah.  He never touched her genitals.  He was making a move assuming that she, uh, you know, she might be interested.  That's all that was.  Yeah.  Was he married at the time?  I don't know.  Gloria Allred just sucks.  Well, the, uh, the thing is, he said, uh, allegedly, uh, you want a job or something 
[02:33:00]  in the middle of doing that.  As if to say, if you, if you do this, I'll give you a job.  I don't believe it.  That's like bad porn dialogue.  It is.  Guys don't say that.  They might act it or imply it, but no guy goes, do you want a job?  I think it separates it from.  Hold on.  The other side of it.  He might've said just that as in, I could, I could say this.  I'm feeling like the situation is okay.  And maybe saying with a little wink in his eye, like, you know, I don't really mean 
[02:33:30]  that, but you know, we both know what's going on here type of shit.  I don't think that that's how that works.  Huh?  You can't just wink about.  No, you know what I mean?  Like the chick can get a job if she sucks your dick.  No, but I think he, I think he was comfortable enough where he could like kind of maybe do  a little joking possibly.  That's all I'm saying.  Yes.  Well, if he wasn't running for president, she never would've come out of the woodwork.  Of course not.  Of course not.  Where was she last year?  Yeah.  Who cares?  Yeah, there she is.  She's, uh, that fucking mopey look. 
[02:34:00]  Is that a wig she has on?  Probably.  That fuck, if that's a wig, that hairdo fucking stinks.  She's not that bad for her age, man.  That fucking stiff, awful hair.  She's not that bad, Jimmy.  She's fuckable, but that's how she, she should have a hand stuck on her leg going, you want  to go to work or what?  Why isn't anyone bringing up the interracial implications?  Exactly.  That's more bothersome, right, Ann?  That's more bothersome to me.  Right?  Right, huh?  Those people shouldn't be doing that.  Well, this is what the accuser said. 
[02:34:30]  While we were driving back to the hotel, he said that he would show me where the National  Restaurant Association offices were.  He parked the car down the block.  Did he?  I thought that we were going to go into the offices so that he could show me around.  At that time, I had on a black pleated skirt, a suit jacket, and a blouse.  He had on a suit with his shirt open.  With no pants.  With his shirt open.  But instead of going into the offices, he suddenly reached over.  He went into my vagina. 
[02:35:00]  And he put his hand on my leg, under my skirt, and reached for my genitals.  Ah, reached for it.  He also grabbed my head.  See, I think she's, uh, she's fooling around with the language there a little bit.  Fuck her and fuck Lori already.  I'm sure his hand moved upwards toward that.  He hit on her.  He hit on her.  Big deal.  He's making a move.  This happened a month ago, I would say.  That's what men and women do.  But 14 years ago, and now you're babbling about it on the news with your fucking shitty  Tanner Boyle haircut?  I hate you. 
[02:35:30]  And I bet you she probably, I would bet money on this one.  God damn it, I gotta say this.  That she probably told Gloria Allred, and you know, his hand was on my thigh or whatever,  and he moved it upwards.  And then she goes, well, let's say toward your genitals.  Exactly.  Because it makes it more.  Because technically it's correct.  Toward the genitals.  Of course.  Because that sounds like lawyer shit, doesn't it?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  We gotta pump this shit up a little bit if we're going in front of the media.  And that's why.  So now he reached for your genitals.  I think she also added in the, you know, said, do you want a job?  I don't buy that. 
[02:36:00]  Because anything else could just be, like you said, he's trying to pick up the girl.  He's making a move.  Right.  But if you say, you want a job, now it's sexual harassment for employment.  Right.  And conveniently blow job job, you know.  Well, yeah.  It's perfect.  Right, Gloria?  It's perfect.  You're probably proud of how you wrote this up for her.  He also grabbed my head and brought it towards his crotch.  You could pound that fucking veal.  You need a sponsor?  You need a sponsor?  I like how he pulled a pesci on her.  Yeah, you pound that fucking veal. 
[02:36:30]  Well, all right.  Let's take this, you know, section by section.  What do you think of that part?  What she should be doing.  Sucking dick.  Listen to her.  She's awful.  Well, that's what her mouth should be doing.  I don't think it'd happen.  I mean, that's rough, obviously.  That's hard to defend and say, well, you know, that's making more moves.  That's a bold move.  That is a bold move.  Look at that fucking awful monster.  Look at Gloria Allred.  Oh, she makes me sick.  That stern look on her fucking face.  Is that what you went to law school for? 
[02:37:00]  This isn't what I came here for.  Mr. Cain said, you want a job, right?  I see.  Well, the Cain Campaign Center released discrediting her,  attacking celebrity defense attorney Gloria Allred and saying  his opponents have now convinced a woman with a long history of severe financial  difficulties, including personal bankruptcy, to falsely accuse the Republican frontrunner.  But some conservatives, and especially conservative women,  Oh, Kier.  Oh, got it there.  ...had and brought it towards his crotch. 
[02:37:30]  I was very, very surprised and very shocked.  I said, what are you doing?  You know I have a boyfriend.  This isn't what I came here for.  Mr. Cain said, you want a job, right?  I asked him to stop, and he did.  I asked him to take me back to my hotel, which he did, right away.  Through your tears.  Through your tears.  So he basically hit on us.  I'm actually crying over here.  Why isn't she crying?  I hate her, and I hate that.  Why is this important 14 years later? 
[02:38:00]  It's not.  If it was such an issue.  It's not.  And why does fucking Gloria Allred have to stick her fucking ugly man face  everywhere?  There's a thing.  Anything with a cunt that has a problem,  they call that fucking monster in.  She's fucking terrible  with her stupid  Harry Dean Stanton hairdo.  I fucking hate Gloria Allred's hair.  What the fuck?  She should be...  Gloria Allred should be banging fucking  Adrian Barbeau in New York when it's a prison.  Brain. 
[02:38:30]  I hate her guts.  She really does have to just inject herself  into every situation.  I hope she falls down an escalator.  I hope she falls down a fucking escalator.  On that monster face.  She's the worst.  No, I hope her vagina gets caught in it.  She trips over the labia.  Now, some people are going to, you know,  call us out on this that we're attacking the accuser.  I don't know.  Fuck the accuser 14 years later.  Something that's extremely suspicious.  14 years later?  She doesn't even seem broken up about it. 
[02:39:00]  Gloria Allred should have told her,  look, you're going to have to cry out there.  Exactly.  If I can have a stern, stupid look on my face,  you could have a few tears.  If I can somehow inject myself like a tumor.  Gloria Allred is a fucking tumor.  Whenever there's something happening,  there she is.  Yeah.  Pops up and ruins your moment.  Fuck her.  I think Herman Cain was going for a move.  Yeah.  Maybe he went to put her head in his lap  and her fucking wig came off.  That looks like a wig.  Yeah.  I hate it.  Well, good for Herman Cain.  He was on Kimmel last night 
[02:39:30]  and he addressed this whole fucking thing.  With humor.  Back on the map, Herman Cain.  Wow.  This could take a while.  Wow.  Hi, guys.  Oh, look at you.  There you are.  So how was your day? 
[02:40:00]  Well, all things considered, I'm still alive.  Yeah.  It got off to somewhat of a rough start.  We had a little surprise to show up on TV.  Yeah.  Did you watch that?  Were you watching?  Yeah.  We watched it because we didn't even know that this whole thing about woman number four  was going to even come out.  Oh, boy.  So that was a surprise.  Yeah.  And at least it wasn't one of the many that have the first name anonymous. 
[02:40:30]  So now this one actually had a name and a face.  So we watched to see what it was and who it was.  And we are dealing with it.  And tomorrow we're going to have a press conference.  Oh, you are having a press conference.  Oh, yeah.  We are going to have a press conference.  We are taking this head on because.  Have you considered hiring Lori already as your attorney?  You almost made me say something that my handlers say you should not say.  Handlers.  Let me put it to you this way. 
[02:41:00]  I can't think of anything that I would hire her to do, okay?  Oh, shit.  I can't think of a thing.  That's funny.  Wow.  I was thinking about this stuff.  And, you know, I know obviously you can't get into the specifics of these things.  But I was just thinking about kind of the human factor.  And I was imagining you watching this and, like, just putting myself in that position.  And I was imagining your wife.  Did you speak to her today?  Was she watching it with you?  My wife is in Atlanta. 
[02:41:30]  We were in San Francisco because I had a speech at noon.  This press conference came on at 1030.  So my wife did watch it.  And I called her immediately afterwards.  And as I was sitting there, I had a few of my staff members there with me.  And I'm sitting here, and they're watching me, and they can see steam coming out of my ears.  And the feelings that you have when you know that all of this is totally fabricated.  You go from anger, then you get disgusted. 
[02:42:00]  You try to control yourself to make sure you watch this thing all the way through.  And I was listening very closely.  And then when it was all over with, I said, well, I know what we got to do because there's not an ounce of truth in all of these accusations.  And my team is putting this stuff together.  That's why I'm willing to do a press conference tomorrow to set the record straight.  I see.  All right.  Well, very good.  Well, I mean, that's all people can ask for.  That's all they can ask for.  And in a way, because people keep asking you about this, there's no way to move forward from here. 
[02:42:30]  I mean, like Tiger Woods tried to not talk about things, and that didn't work out well.  Right.  Tiger Woods also did it.  When I made the statement that I'm done talking about this, I was talking about the firestorm last week.  I see.  I wasn't talking about this new firestorm that we discovered today.  But, no, we are going to talk about this one, and I am going to talk about it at the press conference.  And if there are future firestorms, will you talk about them?  I will talk about any and all future firestorms, because here's one thing people don't know about Herman Cain. 
[02:43:00]  I'm in it to win it, and I'm not going to be discouraged.  Third person.  I like that.  Jimmy likes that.  There you go.  Jimmy likes when Herman talks about Herman like that in the third person.  Didn't you like how – I like the fact that he addressed it, because most of these pussies just ignore it.  And go, I'm not going to –  Yeah.  At least he came on TV and talked about it.  Refreshing as hell.  I like that.  Yeah.  What do you think, though?  Because I was saying he was making a move.  Do you think he was making a move?  Some bullshit and some true.  A little bullshit in there, maybe?  Yeah, but I also think that he's a – I also think that he's a guy who would probably – he's a powerful guy. 
[02:43:30]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Yeah, I think he's a – I don't know.  I think there's some validity in what these women are saying.  I don't know if it's him just making a move or if it's legitimate sexual harassment, but who gives a shit?  If the – can the guy get elected and can he fix the economy?  If that's the case, I'm into what I call back-to-back black.  And I would say no and no.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  He's not going to be our next president. 
[02:44:00]  Okay.  Nope.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break?  We've got a guest coming up.  We've got Army.  Army's back?  Yeah.  We'll take a quick break.  Army Hammer.  He's in J. Edgar Hoover.  Or it's just called J. Edgar.  So we'll do a quick break and we'll have Army on next.  Stay there.  Serious, Serious XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:44:30]  Fucking love this song.  Never got sick of this one.  MGMT, kids.  Army Hammer walking down the hall.  Yeah.  Last we talked to him, he was in Antisocial.  Antisocial Network.  Social Network.  I just said Antisocial.  I actually think it's the name of the movie.  Now, to work it out of my head because you confused me with that.  And now he's starring in J. Edgar in theaters Friday.  J. Edgar.  The J. Edgar Hoover.  Yes.  DiCaprio. 
[02:45:00]  Hey, Army.  Clint Eastwood.  There he is.  How you doing?  Good to see you again.  Welcome back to the show, bro.  How you doing?  Thank you very much for having me, man.  We really had a good time with you last time.  That was fun.  Yeah, it did suck.  We were talking about Social Network.  Social Network.  Yeah.  You're way past that now, obviously.  It's beneath me at this point.  That's old hat.  Yeah.  That would be nice to just kind of have that.  It's not bad.  Like, worst things have happened, I'm sure.  Yeah.  How was DiCaprio?  I'm amazed they have him playing J. Edgar Hoover because he's so much better looking than  Edgar Hoover was. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Rick, I can't see that.  I mean, like, this is the crazy thing.  As soon as I signed on to this movie and I saw, you know, how Leo was going to look and  all that, I went home and I was like, how the fuck are they going to sell this movie?  Leo looks awful.  Like, he's the sell of the point.  He's like, he's the heartthrob.  You know, he looks like a bulldog in the movie.  Oh, he looks bad.  They're really ugly.  But they turned him into J. Edgar Hoover.  He had, like, prosthetics in his mouth to push his cheeks out.  Like, I mean, he had the whole thing, yeah.  Those big jowls.  He had the jowls.  He was wearing two pairs of contacts at all times.  You know, the whole thing, yeah.  Why two pairs? 
[02:46:00]  Because his eyes were those beautiful baby blues, as you know.  But he had the, he put on brown contacts first and then, like, big contacts to make  his eyes kind of look glazy and old.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  That's had a hurt.  That must have been really uncomfortable.  Just all day, like, one pair of contacts is enough.  He's got these two.  And I had to wear, I had to wear contacts that were the size of, like, dish plates in my eyes  so that I could get, you know, the bloodshot.  And they do, like, the Arcus, that, like, soft white circle.  Old people get around their eyes and stuff like that.  So it was a lot of fun stuff you never really get to do.  Did Leo gain weight, too, for his role? 
[02:46:30]  I don't know.  Like, I didn't really, I wasn't, like, with him through the whole beginning of the process.  I know that he was definitely wearing, like, prosthetics and stuff like that to make him  look a little heavier.  He probably gained a little bit of weight, I'm sure.  Is it harder to act like that when you've got stuff in your eyes?  Like, when De Niro did Raging Bull, he had a prosthetic nose.  Yeah.  Which I didn't notice because it's black and white.  But doesn't that distract from what you're doing?  In a way, it can, definitely.  But also, it helps.  You know, it's like if you look in the mirror and you see an old person, it's, like, less  work that you have to do in your imagination as an actor, I guess. 
[02:47:00]  How old are you playing?  I start at, like, 27 and go all the way to 72.  Jeez.  But, like, several strokes and stuff like that.  So it's, like, it's an aged 72.  I look like a piece of leather by the end of the movie.  Okay.  Yeah, it's got to be bad.  Yeah.  And Hoover's love interest, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So how did that play out?  Man, it was dreamy.  No, it was great, man.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Joe Frazier?  Yeah, Smoking Joe.  We had him in here, man.  You did, really?  Two years ago.  I thought it was, like, last year. 
[02:47:30]  I know, we really did.  But he was awesome, man.  What a great personality.  Oh, dude.  Like, did you see that documentary where he was, like, he plays, it was on HBO or something  like that, and he plays his voicemail on his phone, and it's like, you have reached Smoking  Joe Frazier, the man who messed up Muhammad Ali.  And, like, he's still going on and on and on about it.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what he was promoting, actually.  It was a thriller in Manila.  Documentary.  The documentary, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Which was really good.  Yeah, it was great.  He played us the voicemail, too.  He'll play it for anyone, man.  Oh, I'm sure, yeah.  Watching that left hook, what's better than Frazier's left hook? 
[02:48:00]  It's not in this fight, but when he fucking floors Ali with that left hook.  It's incredible.  I mean, he was, I mean, just an impeccable boxer, man.  Just so powerful and fun to watch and just, like, dynamic.  Impossible to hit.  Yeah, yeah.  It almost looked like he didn't know how to fight because he moved so much.  Right, right, right.  But he had, like, he was loose the whole time, too.  You know, he's, like, all over the place.  He's fun to watch, man.  Yeah, it's terrible.  I know, right?  But he's just ducking and moving so much, but it's like, he should have won two out of three  of those fights, because we were saying that earlier, it's like, he just, he didn't know  that Ali said, cut the gloves off me. 
[02:48:30]  He just didn't know that.  Ali said, cut the gloves off me.  Oh, that's right, yeah.  And Frazier just gave up first.  Oh, man.  I think Armie's avoiding the question, though.  Which question?  Which question?  The love interest of Hoover.  Oh, dude, I'll dive right in.  Oh, fine, please.  All of a sudden he goes, oh, wow, Frazier.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, you're talking about male-on-male love at boxing.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, right.  Clyde Tulsa or Clyde?  Clyde.  It is Clyde.  Okay, Clyde Barker.  So he was, there was the rumors for years, but no one said it, that they thought Edgar  was gay, but nobody said that back then.  You could be crazy. 
[02:49:00]  You'd have FBI guys going through your trash.  Like, there's no way you could, these were two of the most secretive and protective people  of, like, the 20th century.  But is that in the movie, though?  Yeah, yeah, for sure.  I mean, it's not in the movie that people couldn't say that they were or weren't gay,  but the movie doesn't really take, like, a hard stance.  Like, it doesn't say, yeah, these guys were boyfriends or anything like that.  No Brokeback Mountain scene.  No, no, no.  You know, there was a rear entry scene that they edited out, you know.  Spits in his fucking hand.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's fly.  But you don't, what you see is two polished sets of shoes. 
[02:49:30]  You don't see any sex happening, just one facing the back of the other.  We did it real artistic.  Yeah, yeah, those oldie style shoes.  We just think it's funny, because when Sean Penn played Harvey there, Harvey Milk.  And I want to recruit you.  I know you're angry.  I'm angry.  That's it.  Harvey's a great guy.  That's hilarious.  Just goes with whatever he's in.  Yeah, that's a...  But it's funny to me that, obviously, Sean Penn negotiated how much gay stuff he would  do. 
[02:50:00]  Interesting.  Because he had an all-out make-out scene, and then the rest of the scenes were done in  shadows where you couldn't see if anything was going on.  Oh, so he's like, you get one kiss.  Yeah, yeah, that's pretty much...  That's what I'm thinking.  That he went with his people and said, this is what we'll negotiate.  I'll go all in for one fucking scene, and that is it.  The rest, you could film around it.  There were always shadows in the bed and stuff when they were supposedly kissing.  What's the most, I guess, homoerotic scene in the movie, as far as that really tips you  off?  Like, all right, they're a little more than just buddies.  Yeah, there's a...  Well, I found out they were more than buddies... 
[02:50:30]  Oh, yeah, sorry.  I found out they were more than buddies when I was doing my research, and I saw that there's  a collection of photos that J. Edgar took of Clyde sleeping.  And it's like...  I mean, that is intimate.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I have one of the pictures, which is incredible.  But the most intimate scene we have in the movie is like...  It's this great scene.  It starts in like a hotel room, and they start talking.  They're like, oh, did you see his shoes?  Oh, my God, how tacky.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then the subject of women comes up, and it's like, why are you talking about women? 
[02:51:00]  What is wrong?  And he's like, well, I'm thinking about marrying a woman.  And then it's like, the scene just explodes, and they get into an all-out fist fight, beating  the shit out of each other, blood everywhere, and then at the end of the fight, there's  like one kiss, and it's like, I mean, it's not like, when I signed on to this movie, all  the women were like, you get to kiss Leo, you're so lucky, and I'm like, I don't think you  get what kind of kiss this is.  There's broken glass and fake blood everywhere.  Like, it's pretty intense.  So they were like, they didn't live together, did they?  Yeah, at the end of their lives, yeah.  They're buried next to each other, they live together, yeah, everything. 
[02:51:30]  When Hoover died, he left everything for Clyde.  Isn't it so weird that gay people are seen as soft, and yet one of the most ruthless  guys ever in this country was fucking, was gay.  It's so weird, this weird perception.  Yeah.  I don't know why I had to say that, I guess it's pretty obvious.  What else?  What I also liked in there, you got to see stuff that none of us get to see.  Some of J. Edgar Hoover's files, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're not seeing these pictures of Clyde sleeping.  No, I mean, it's not anything that I just went out and found, and it wasn't anything that 
[02:52:00]  production provided, because I didn't have a single conversation with Clint about the  character or about the movie at all.  So they just handed you stuff.  He was just like, show up on this day, and we're going to work.  Did he also, you know, give you files to go through and like, check this shit out?  No, nothing.  Oh, no, okay.  He just gave you a script?  Just a script, but then I hired a researcher, and I just handed her the script, Amy Hammond,  and I was like, find me everything.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, so that's right.  I had almost every picture of Clyde ever taken, going all the way back to his yearbook photo from  third grade.  How does that help you?  Like, I'm sure it does, but what does it do when you look at all that stuff?  Does it just kind of help you figure out what he might have been like? 
[02:52:30]  I mean, what does it do for you?  Tons, dude.  I mean, you see the person, and especially with Clyde, he's not J. Edgar Hoover.  He was the behind-the-scenes guy, so nobody knows anything about him.  He was secretive, and that's the way he liked it.  He liked, you know, being in the background.  So, you know, going through all that, you know, I had all of his letters that he wrote  to his brother.  I mean, I had all those things.  The Cheever letters.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then like, you know, like Freedom of Information Act, I had like a bunch of stuff and all that kind  of shit, and then, but the thing that was the most helpful were the pictures.  It's like, because, you know, they were so protected that, you know, when you'd write 
[02:53:00]  a letter, it's like, I hope you are finding yourself in good health.  I am as well.  And everything was so, you know, stilted and old school.  Eloquent.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So really, where I got most of the stuff from was looking through all the pictures.  It's like, because you can't lie about body protection.  Right, right, right.  How's Clint Eastwood?  Is that just amazing?  He's epic.  I mean, I, like, it's, it's, it's just, it's still bizarre to walk into a room and see  him there.  Like, we've worked together now for a long time.  Like, we have a great relationship, but still, you're just like.  Wait, you had other projects? 
[02:53:30]  I was fucking Clint Eastwood.  No, just like this project.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Is he, uh, is he intimidating as a director?  I know as a person he has to be, but.  As a person, he's the most intimidating.  Yeah, that guy is fucking Clint Eastwood.  Yes or anything you say, but as a director, he's the best.  Is he really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, if we were going to shoot a scene in this room, we'd walk in, like me, Leo, and  him, before anybody else got there, and he'd go, okay, well, this is where we're going  to do the scene, so do you guys want to put it on his feet?  And it's like, sure, where do you want us to stand?  And he'll go, anywhere you want.  He's like, really?  All right, yeah.  He kind of lets you as actors do.  Everything, yeah. 
[02:54:00]  I guess that's the advantage to an actor and director.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he wouldn't want a director, you know, on his ass, like telling him, you got to do  it like this, you got to do this.  So he doesn't do it.  If he likes your audition, he likes something you did.  He understands the actor.  Yeah, so just come in and do that.  But he always wanted to bring an orangutan in on the scene.  Where's the orangutan going?  Especially with the name, too.  Right turn, Clyde.  So did you, was there anything, if he didn't like something, what would he say to you?  How would he tell you, like, to read?  Because I heard Kubrick would just make you do it and do it and do it.  Yeah.  Right.  What would Clint do if he didn't like something?  Very little. 
[02:54:30]  I mean, there wasn't much that we did that he didn't like, because we're pretty awesome.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But, no, like, he would be really subtle about things.  Like, he would just go, I mean, I remember one scene we did, he goes, all right, it's  getting a little gay.  Let's back it up a little bit.  All right, sorry, sorry, sorry.  It's getting a little gay.  Yeah.  Yeah, he probably wanted to keep, if you make it too much that, you kind of take away from  the rest of the story.  Right, right, right.  And this wasn't the main part of the story.  The main part of the story was J. Edgar and sort of creating the FBI and sort of the tormented  life he led. 
[02:55:00]  So...  Did you paint Tolson as the more, because you said he was secretive and you went over,  and she, but he was the behind the, like, a lot of people think Bush Cheney, Cheney  is the more ruthless of the guys, because he was more the second, did you paint him as  the more ruthless guy, or do you think he was?  He was.  He definitely was.  He had a reputation in the FBI as, like, the hatchet man, because J. Edgar, who actually  was ruthless, would say, get rid of that guy.  And it would be Clyde who'd have to go up to him and go, oh, wow.  Look, dude, you're fired.  Sorry, you know, submit your resignation, like that kind of thing.  He had a reputation in the FBI.  Like, if he was walking down a hallway, people would go into rooms that they weren't even 
[02:55:30]  supposed to be in, just to, like, get out of the way of the hallway.  Yeah.  Were they supposed to be lovers before, or did it occur while they were in the FBI together?  They met when Clyde came in to sort of interview for the job at the FBI, and that's where  they met.  And that's, like...  A young brash man comes in the interview.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Love at first sight.  Yeah.  Do they address Melvin Purvis at all?  He was an agent that...  Melvin Purvis, G-Man.  He had the hots for her, supposedly.  Yeah, Purvis is in the movie.  It's smaller parts, you know.  Who plays Purvis?  Oh, dude, what was his name? 
[02:56:00]  Okay, he's not like a...  Yeah.  No, I mean, it's like two scenes for Purvis.  What about the interaction between, like, Hoover and Nixon?  Yeah, you've got that in there for sure.  That's huge.  Who's playing Nixon?  I don't know, but he's got the Nixon voice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's like, that cocksucker.  Cocksucker.  Yeah.  Oh, did you say that about Hoover?  Yeah, yeah.  And then he's like, as soon as he finds out Hoover dies, you know, he goes on camera,  he's like, America has lost a hero.  And then as soon as it cuts, he's like, get that cocksucker's files, I want them all!  Fucking Nixon! 
[02:56:30]  That's great.  Wasn't the thing...  Oh, that sounds cool.  They didn't know where his files were.  That's why no one could kill him.  No, his secretary shredded them all.  Helen Gandy.  The day he died, he had an agreement with his secretary.  He had his own, like, private and personal confidential files.  He said, as soon as I die, they're coming for it.  He knew they would.  So he was just like, get rid of everything.  So the day he died, she went into work, signed in, and shredded all of his files.  Why wouldn't they sneak into his office while he was still alive?  They tried.  But by the time they found out that he was dead, she had already got the call from his  housekeeper and had started doing all the stuff. 
[02:57:00]  But when they...  Didn't they not know where all of his files were?  Wasn't that the big fear with Hoover?  Is that if...  All right, so you got rid of him.  Somebody else knows where other shit is that we don't know.  So if he's alive, at least he's protecting...  There's a copy out there of all the files, right?  I like the fact that at least he had them...  I'm surprised he didn't just turn them over to Tulsa, though.  Why didn't he do that?  Or you don't...  Tulsa was really sick by the end.  I mean, yeah, he had one foot in the grave by that point.  Who died first, Hoover?  Hoover, yeah.  Wow.  You must be a great actor.  Who?  You, because I can't imagine you playing a ruthless role. 
[02:57:30]  But everyone's saying that you were amazing in this movie, so...  Oh, thanks.  Roland saw it.  He said, holy shit, this movie was great.  Yeah.  How was it?  Were you intimidated at all by DiCaprio?  Do you not get intimidated by other actors?  I don't know, man.  I don't really get that intimidated by many people except for Clint.  But my first day, I walk onto set and they go, okay, everything moves really quickly here.  We just want you to know, so go to your trailer, get ready.  We'll come get you when we need you.  We need you.  And it's like, okay, let's go.  So I walk onto set and there's a seat in this chair and I sit down and I look over and it's like, 
[02:58:00]  Leonardo DiCaprio, all right.  And then it's like, oh shit, and Judi Dench and now Clint Eastwood, this is too much.  I mean, like the first day was a lot.  Had you rehearsed with them or no?  No, nothing.  Well, Leo and I had rehearsed.  Like, I went over to his house a couple times and just sort of talked about it.  How's that, going over to his house?  Yeah, it was great.  Like, the first time I was just like...  What'd you see that you went, holy fuck?  What did I see?  What can I say?  I know it's a lot of questions, but...  Yeah.  He's got an impressive art collection and just like cool shit. 
[02:58:30]  Picassos?  I didn't see any Picassos.  Any stolen art?  Probably, yeah.  It's all hot.  Yeah.  Norwalk tusks.  I mean, like all kinds of stuff.  Dogs playing poker?  Yeah.  Yeah, Alan.  Yeah, that's a fun painting.  So you want to actually go over the lines and get down, okay, you're going to do this,  I'm going to do that.  You guys both just kind of on your own go over there and get it?  Yeah.  And then when you meet in his house, you kind of just loosely rehearse it?  When we met at his house, we just sort of talked through it. 
[02:59:00]  Like, we would say, okay, then I say this, blah, blah, blah.  And then he would say his line, and I go, okay, this is...  And we would really just read through the scenes.  Just to get the dialogue.  Yeah, just to get the rhythm of it, just to sort of understand it.  But like, Clint wanted to keep us very raw and instinctual.  I think that's why he doesn't do a lot of rehearsals.  Now, why is that?  What does he...  I think he likes what he gets.  He likes that, you know, we have a fight scene in the movie and he didn't give us choreography.  He was just like, fight it out.  That's fucked up.  Yeah, so it was literally just like two men just like grabbing and like wrestling and shaking.  I mean, it looked like a real fight for two guys who didn't know how to fight, which is like what it should have been. 
[02:59:30]  Because like, you can't go at them with like a jab cross, you know?  It's like, it had to be guys who didn't know what they were doing.  And it's just like frustration more than anything.  So, yeah.  Just start slapping each other.  We're just one step above that.  Did you audition for this or did they come to you and go, look, we would love you to play this guy?  No, no, no.  Clint had no idea who I was.  He hadn't seen Social Network either.  Like the first day on set, he was like, oh, I hear you have a movie I have to see.  And I was like, oh, my God.  I was like, you haven't seen that?  What am I doing here, dude?  Like, seriously?  I never saw Dirty Harry.  Yeah.  How do you feel about that? 
[03:00:00]  Best line in the fucking Dirty Harry's was when he says to the boss, your mouthwash ain't making it.  The guy's yelling in his face.  What a fucking cool guy thing to say that it is, man.  The best Clint answer that I've heard so far is, you know, he suffers fool.  Like, he suffers no fools.  So, we were doing an interview with a lady and she was asking him a question.  And she was just like, so, were you, did you know anything about J. Edgar and the FBI?  And he's like, I was alive, yeah.  And she was like, oh, oh, oh.  Well, then, were you fascinated by J. Edgar?  Is that, were you always just intrigued by the man? 
[03:00:30]  And he goes, no.  She goes, well, why'd you do the movie?  And he goes, I like the script.  She must have been pissing herself.  She felt this big, I'm sure.  He probably just was tired of her and her dumb questions.  Good for him.  And Clint Eastwood, he doesn't have to appease anybody.  How old is he now?  He's 75, is he 80?  He's 82.  82.  And he's going to outlive us all.  In between camera setups, he'll set up a shot and go, you know, you're going to do this, this, and this.  And they'll go, okay, we need, you know, 10 minutes to set it up. 
[03:01:00]  And they'll go, okay, and he'll go out of the stage to a gym that he has built everywhere he goes and lift weights in between camera setups.  Does he really?  Dude, he's got, like, his arms are big.  Like, when he, he put on, like, a demonstration of the fight for us, and, like, it was just he and his buddy, Buddy Van Horn, and they're both, like, octogenarians.  Buddy's been a stuntman and with him since Rawhide.  And they're just, like, wailing on each other and the whole thing.  Come on, please.  No, it's incredible.  And I'm watching Clint fight, and I'm like, this old man could beat the shit out of me.  Like, no joke.  That's fucked up, man.  So, Jay Moore had a good Clint Eastwood story about him getting annoyed at somebody. 
[03:01:30]  I've heard the story.  It's a great story.  And did you find him annoyed at anybody on the set, or was there no problems like that?  No, like, one, I mean, his set, like, his crew, it's, like, the newest guy on the crew has been with him for, like, five movies, and he's still, like, the new guy, you know?  Oh, yeah.  So, you know, everybody knows his deal.  Everybody knows how he works.  Everybody knows, sort of, how to make him happy, and everybody does, you know?  Back in those days with Hoover, too, was there any, in JFK, in the movie, they show, like, Pesci's character talking about, like, Hoover, and they show, like, apparently those weird pictures of them at parties and shit like that. 
[03:02:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Um, was it known that he was gay, or was that just something that the fucking inside, inside Washington?  No, it was known.  Like, uh, it was known in as much as people knew that confirmed bachelors at the time were gay.  Like, gay wasn't a word for them.  It was, like, happy.  You know, it's in almost every song.  It's like, I'm so gay.  You know, it's, like, it meant different things.  So, people didn't know.  Like, they don't have gaydar like we do now. 
[03:02:30]  That's why we talk about that whole thing with the confirmed bachelor.  Here he is.  Here he is, ladies.  Look at him.  Yeah.  He's a loyal friend to this man, but he's looking.  Yeah.  Like, really?  He and his companion would love to take you out to dinner and shopping.  The news guy had it.  No.  A Broadway show.  He was just playing his part, too?  Eh, probably.  Turned off the recorder and went, cocksucker?  What year did he die?  72?  Yep.  Wow.  It's amazing how that legend is still fucking very powerful. 
[03:03:00]  Like, his name is still, like, a really, it's called a frightening name.  He's a frightening guy.  Roland Sane is an Oscar movie.  It's kind of an Oscar movie.  I mean, you know.  Not going with that.  From Roland's mouth to God's ears.  Nothing comes out of Roland's mouth.  He only goes in.  Yeah, exactly.  Roland has to go to God to get certain bookings.  God said, your mouthwash ain't cutting it.  What a great line, right?  Fantastic.  Does Clint act at all anymore, or no?  Is he strictly directing?  Uh, I don't know.  Like, I think he would. 
[03:03:30]  I think he's going to.  What was his last movie as an actor?  Gran Torino, I think.  Oh, right.  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  He was good in that.  Yeah.  He was great in that, man.  Yeah, he put a cranky old racist.  Fuck, yeah.  He was good in that.  What was that other one?  Perfect World?  Was that, uh...  Oh, Hereafter?  No, that was the one with the kid, and, um...  Who the fuck else was in that?  Was it Costner?  Kevin Costner?  Kidnapped the little kid.  Oh, fuck, dude.  That was one of his.  You totally got me.  Let me see.  Kevin Costner.  Yeah, people are going, yeah.  Yeah.  What was it called?  I think it was Perfect World.  Perfect World, okay. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah, well...  I liked it!  Million Dollar Baby.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  I love Hilary Swank.  That's a few years ago now.  Fine.  You know.  Are you going to be the Lone Ranger?  I am, yeah.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, it's exciting, man.  For sure.  I love Westerns.  Like, they're one of my favorite genres, and they don't make a lot of them, so to get  to be in one, I need to be the Lone Ranger.  Have you started?  Do you know how to ride?  No.  I do know how to ride.  We have not started.  We start February.  Now, knowing how to ride, is it because you grew up riding, or do you just...  Yeah, I mean, I have a lot of family in Texas.  My grandparents live in Oklahoma.  We'd go there for the summer and stuff like that. 
[03:04:30]  You're good, man.  Yeah.  You don't hold on to the horn?  No way, man.  No way.  No way, man.  I'll do the no hands, standing on the horse, you know?  Yeah.  And Johnny Depp is playing Tonto.  Is that still true?  Is it?  It's still true.  He just seems like he wants to play odd roles.  Like, he's just got bored with...  He's never played the same thing twice, really, unless it's a sequel, but...  But it makes it fun to watch his movies, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  And you've done no rehearsing or any of that stuff for that?  No.  I've never met Johnny.  I haven't talked to him or anything like that.  How about Clayton Moore?  Are you going to look him up?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The original, yeah.  Talk about holding...  Oh, shit.  Talk about holding on to something, like, for way too long. 
[03:05:00]  Like, he J. Edgar Hoovered the Lone Ranger, for sure.  Yeah.  Well, they had issues with him also wearing the mask.  Remember that?  Yes.  They wouldn't let him wear the mask.  They forced him to stop wearing the mask.  Yeah, I wear those big cataract sunglasses.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We'd have cataract surgery and put those things on.  How do you force a guy from not wearing a mask as an old guy, too?  What a terrible lawyer he must have had.  Not be able to wear a mask.  Not be able to wear the mask.  It's all he's got in his life.  You know.  Jesus.  He had to yell, Ohio Argentium.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[03:05:30]  That was very good.  I hate Steven Singer's going to love that.  Tie in, Steven Singer.  And also, you're doing something with Julia Roberts?  Yeah, we just finished...  Oh, you did already?  Yeah, we finished, like, a month and a half ago.  It was a...  Well, now it's called Mirror, Mirror, but it was a Snow White story.  I certainly hope the cover isn't you two back-to-back with your arms folded looking at each other over your shoulder.  Me, too.  Me, too.  Unfortunately, those decisions are way above my pay grade.  I love those.  Is it a rom-com?  I can't get enough of those.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like a rom-com fairy tale.  I like rom-traj. 
[03:06:00]  Rom-traj.  Those are great.  Tragic roms.  Yeah.  Starts off really happy and fun, and just before they go to Europe,  there's an axe murder.  It just doesn't belong in the movie.  So, I always find it weird.  J. Edgar, when did you guys finish that?  A while ago, right?  Yeah, beginning of this year.  And now you have to go backwards to talk about this movie,  even though you've already done another movie.  That is an odd thing.  I always find that weird with you guys.  Yeah, it's definitely a weird part of the job.  Like, you know, having to go on a press tour from 7 in the morning until 11 o'clock at night 
[03:06:30]  to answer the same questions normally over and over.  And it's shit you've done years ago.  So, in a way, don't you feel like you put that behind you already,  and you're moving on to your, you know what I mean?  Well, you have to for your own, like, mental health and sanity.  Right.  You can't hang on to all that shit.  And all of a sudden, they call you and go, it's time to promote that.  Like, wow, that was like nine months ago, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But there's a weird thing.  They're done with this movie, and they go back and do the other one,  and then you'll do this Lone Ranger movie,  and then you'll start promoting the Julia Roberts movie.  I'm glad I'm explaining his schedule to him.  Yeah, yeah.  I've done fucking four lines in a bunch of horrible films.  I've been to nothing more than a D film. 
[03:07:00]  So you play Julia Roberts' love interest?  Yeah, more like lust interest.  Like, she's like the queen who's evil,  and I'm like this young prince who comes into the kingdom from a wealthy place,  and she's like, hello.  So you get to make out with DiCaprio and Julia Roberts in back-to-back films?  Didn't make out with Julia Roberts.  Oh, shit.  All right, well, I'd probably make out with him, though.  Well, DiCaprio's good enough.  Just for the story.  He has the softest lips, I tell you.  Was it weird, though?  Like, I mean, as an actor, you know you've got to do it. 
[03:07:30]  And again, if he's doing it, you've got to do it.  Yeah, you know what's crazy?  You know what the weirdest thing about it?  I was expecting it to be a little bit strange,  just because I don't kiss dudes in my personal life.  Oh, right?  Yeah.  But I was shocked at how much it just felt like kissing.  It didn't feel weird.  Like, afterwards, I wasn't like toothbrush or anything like that.  You know what I mean?  I get why my wife likes it when I shave now,  but other than that, it really just felt like kissing a weird way.  Did you keep going, all right, Clint, I think we need one more.  I think we need one more here. 
[03:08:00]  Did you suggest that you two rehearse that when you were at his house?  Like, look, dude, I know it's weird, but we should rehearse the kiss scene.  No, Leo wanted to rehearse,  and he wanted to go back and do it after we even finished the scene  to see if we could perfect it in any way.  And I was like, dude, I think we got it, you know?  How many times did you have to do it?  Not many.  I mean, maybe ten.  Is it a soft kiss, or is it like a kiss kiss?  No, it's in the middle of like a fist fight.  I don't even know if I should be saying all this, but yeah.  That makes me, believe me, that makes me want to see the film,  knowing that you were comfortable doing it, I guess. 
[03:08:30]  I mean, yeah.  Was that your first time ever kissing a guy?  Yeah.  That's got to make it like a little nerve-wracking, I think.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like my first kiss on camera.  Oh, my gosh.  Was that your first on-camera kiss?  No, no, no, with the dudes.  Look at them.  Don't, I don't know.  Fucking playing Quasimodo?  I kissed one person on camera in my life.  It was Nina Hartley, the old porn girl.  Right, the porn girl.  We made out, we did a comedy, a short, which we shot the comic strip,  and at the end of it, she and I make out. 
[03:09:00]  So I go to her dressing room, I'm like,  I never kissed a girl on camera before,  because she was a porn girl, I was trying to be more respectful.  Yeah.  So she's like, well, come here, baby,  and she starts making out with me in the dressing room,  and she's rubbing my dick, and then we're-  What?  She was just to get me turned on.  That's how Leo does it.  And she's like, we're supposed to be into each other,  and then when we're kissing on the set,  she takes my hand, and she puts it on her tits.  She goes, come on, you know, you'll want to.  And she was just great.  You're like, yeah, I do.  She turned me on in front of a full set of people.  Wow.  I still think DiCaprio's a cooler kiss, though,  even though I enjoyed kissing her a lot. 
[03:09:30]  Did you make out with Leo?  In real life, no.  Unless he'd put me in a movie.  But on camera, I wouldn't do any of it.  To me, again, if you realize it's DiCaprio,  it's not a gay thing.  It's just you're both just doing a role.  Just actors.  It's a hell of an opportunity, you know?  Seriously.  To be in the co-star with him.  Yeah, yeah, to get to even be in that movie with him  and, you know, Clint and the whole thing.  And that's probably his first time doing that on camera as well.  No, he's done it.  I think he kissed a dude in Basketball Diaries.  Basketball Diaries, right. 
[03:10:00]  And also-  Did he really?  Yeah, yeah.  I think so.  I don't remember.  Okay.  What else did he do?  Oh, the guy in Basketball Diaries got the young DiCaprio, too.  Yeah, in the bathroom's going tight, too.  Yeah, look at you.  Yeah, he mentioned he had a funny story about doing Basketball Diaries  because their kiss was, I think, I think it was Basketball Diaries.  I don't know.  It was like much more intimate.  But he was like, you know, he talked to the dude before the kiss.  He's like, all right, let's choreograph this.  I'm going to keep my tongue on this side of the mouth.  You keep your tongue over there.  Wow. 
[03:10:30]  And I'm going to run my tongue on the inside of my cheek  from the front to the back so it looks like your tongue,  but it's not going to be.  It's going to be my tongue.  Keep your tongue out of my mouth.  Yeah, like they had a whole choreography for it.  I wonder if that was more awkward than actually just doing it.  The conversation of just like-  Yeah.  How are you going to do it?  Because you're kind of not to-  If you're malprostituting yourself,  which I think he was doing in that film,  you're not supposed to like kissing another older or whatever guy.  So you just-  Yeah, so it would be natural to kind of be repulsed.  I think Will Smith wouldn't do it in- 
[03:11:00]  He probably would now,  but in Six Degrees of Separation,  he was supposed to kiss, right?  And he wouldn't-  Yeah, he said he regrets it now.  He regrets-  Oh, he did say he regrets it?  Yeah.  Did they bring in a body double or-  Maybe they just cut away.  I don't remember, to be honest.  They brought in DJ Jazzy Jeff.  He's like, hey, who are kissing you, man?  Finally gave him some work.  Kiss this man for me.  Yeah.  When you're doing a movie, do you start to think,  like, because you were great in the social network,  do you start to think Oscar-  Is it hard to not think of it? 
[03:11:30]  Like, if someone mentions Oscar,  does it start to play in your head?  Like, fuck, man, I might be able to-  No, no, no, not at all.  I mean, especially not when you're making the movie.  I was just too nervous about dropping the ball.  You know, it's like you really just focus on the job at hand.  And I think, like, as an actor,  it's like one of the luxuries of my job  as opposed to the directing and all that  is when I'm done on the movie,  I'm done on the movie.  It's like I walk away.  And it's like I have officially finished my work on Jay Edgar.  So anything that happens after this point,  it's just a fun ride.  Like, I get to enjoy it,  like the fruits of my labor, I guess.  But it's not like anything I'm thinking about before.  When you see a final cut of it, 
[03:12:00]  is there anything that they take out  that you're like, fuck,  I wish they would have left that?  Or, man, I thought we did a better take,  but maybe this one was just shot better.  Do you go through that when you watch a final cut?  Yeah, there was one scene.  That at first I was like,  oh, that's really a great scene  that sort of shows you more of Clyde's sort of personality.  But then after I was thinking about it,  I was like, you know what?  No, it flows better.  Like, it's right that they took it out.  Did you talk to anybody who actually knew Clyde?  Like, anybody in his family?  Yeah, I did.  No one in his family.  But I talked to Deke Deloche,  who was like an FBI agent with Edgar and Clyde 
[03:12:30]  and all those guys back in the day.  Got nothing from him.  I mean, you talk to him.  It's like the same thing.  He's like, well, of course,  they had nothing but the most professional of relationships.  You're like, all right, I'm going to stop you here.  Thank you.  Thanks for wasting my time.  Thank you.  Oh, he wouldn't give you the skinny, right?  Nothing, nothing.  How old is the guy?  He's got to be in his 90s.  Holy shit.  But still sharp.  Like, he'll say to you,  on November 3rd,  Clyde came in with a memo about this,  and you're just like,  whoa, dude,  you're talking about something 70 years ago or something.  So he was giving you information, 
[03:13:00]  but he didn't give you any real insight into the guy himself?  Nothing, yeah, yeah.  How did you,  you only got that just by watching tape and looking at photos?  Photos definitely helped.  Photos were probably the most helpful thing,  but then also his letters and stuff like that,  and memos that he would write to J. Edgar in the FBI  that, you know,  became declassified later and stuff like that I had.  Did you find anything in the letters,  like to Edgar,  that seemed like,  like when you're looking back with perfect hindsight,  like, wow,  that could have been something one lover would say to another,  even though you,  oh, nothing at all.  I went back and re-read all the stuff 
[03:13:30]  before we started doing all the press stuff  just so I could sort of re-familiarize myself with it.  Nothing.  I mean,  those guys were faults.  What was the most,  in the photograph,  what was the most revealing thing  or accidentally revealing thing  that you thought you might have seen?  The sleeping photos.  Oh,  that Edgar took of him.  That Edgar took of Clyde,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  that was definitely the most revealing thing.  And also,  the picture of him when he was seven,  he went to a school that had dirt floors in Laredo, Missouri.  And you know,  people are dressed like farmers  and then there's like Clyde Tolson standing in the photo 
[03:14:00]  with like the perfect suit,  you know,  the pocket square,  the watch fob,  the hair perfectly combed,  a bow tie,  and you're like,  what's he doing there?  Yeah,  seriously,  it's like,  oh,  he knew this about himself from a young age.  All right.  And he did.  Like,  he was as open as someone could be in the time.  I mean,  on his application to the FBI,  he actually put,  I have no interest in women.  I mean,  that's like,  that's 1920s code for,  or I'll put that in my mouth if you want me to.  So,  I mean,  it was interesting,  man.  That's such a cool role to play,  man,  because he's such a guy that nobody ever talks about, 
[03:14:30]  but was such an important guy  because everybody knows Hoover  and most people don't know that fucking,  there was a second half to that.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Clyde really kept him on track.  You know,  Hoover,  if left to his own devices,  would do things like,  you know,  fire all the agents,  we're going to hire new ones.  And Clyde would be like,  uh,  calm down,  take a breath,  breathe into this bag,  you know.  He was like the codependent partner  who knew he was dealing with  kind of a fucking fly off the handle.  Yeah,  totally.  Was the,  I'm sorry.  I was just going to ask,  what do you know about some of the stuff,  uh,  because you did some research there,  uh,  with the celebrities like John Lennon and, 
[03:15:00]  uh,  yeah,  he,  he did not like anybody.  I mean,  he really distrusted everybody equally.  Uh,  yeah,  he hated John Lennon.  I mean,  he,  he,  it's funny,  man,  he didn't change.  Like when he started in the early 1920s,  communism was a serious threat.  They were blowing shit up,  you know,  they were trying to overthrow the country.  So he was like,  wow,  this is,  this is a serious problem.  So he made communism sort of his thing.  And then,  uh,  he never got past it.  So then,  you know,  cut to the civil rights movement where it's like,  no,  this is a good uprising of the people.  Like this is not communism. 
[03:15:30]  This is a good thing.  But he still was like,  no,  no,  this is bad.  Uprisings are communists.  I know it.  And that's sort of the attitude he always maintained.  Who did he like is the better question.  It seemed like he hated everybody.  Yeah.  Was he religious at all?  Was there a short list of people he actually liked and admired?  Clyde.  I think Clyde,  Clyde and Helen Gandy,  his,  his,  his,  literally it.  That was it.  Yeah.  No real friends,  no real celebrity friends or any of that shit.  Yeah.  Nothing.  I mean,  he had like celebrity friends and he was a man about town and he was like one of the most  powerful dudes in DC. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  So he could go to any restaurant and like sit with,  you know,  Lila Rogers or whatever.  I mean,  he had the best seats always,  but you know,  he'd sit down and have a dinner with them and they'd think,  Oh,  it's,  you know,  so wonderful.  He's,  he's our great friend.  And then,  you know,  he'd die and like,  uh,  you know,  things become declassified.  He had files on all of them,  logging everything they said.  Uh,  I actually,  a dude interviewed me for the press tour and he was,  and after the interview,  he was like,  you know,  my dad met Jared Hoover when he was eight years old because my government or my dad,  my,  his dad used to work for the state department or something like that.  And he said, 
[03:16:30]  uh,  when he was eight years old,  he met Jay Edgar in his office and he said to me,  he goes,  Mr.  Hoover,  I'm so glad that the FBI is here protecting and keeping the American people safe.  And he was like,  Oh,  you're a true patriot,  blah,  blah,  blah,  blah.  And he said years later,  it all became declassified and there was a file on this eight year old kid.  And the only thing in the file was a piece of paper that said on this day,  he told the director that he's happy about the FBI.  And that's it.  I wonder if he was OCD.  For sure.  You think he was OCD and that's how he dealt with information.  He,  he could not throw away anything.  He had to log everything. 
[03:17:00]  I mean,  I,  I can't say conclusively he had OCD,  but I mean,  where there's smoke,  there's fire.  There was rumors too that I'd heard,  um,  that he was,  that there was,  he was part black or was that,  was that not addressed in the film at all?  It may have just been a rumor that was just not completely unfounded.  I don't know.  I never,  I never,  Oh,  it didn't.  Okay.  And,  uh,  do they address,  I guess they,  the Robert Kennedy,  cause didn't he hate Robert Kennedy?  Hated both the Kennedy.  For,  uh,  going over his head to JFK.  And there's,  there's a,  there's definitely,  it touches on the Kennedy thing and it touches on the fact that Jay Edgar was the first person to know he was assassinated. 
[03:17:30]  He was the first person to call and say,  the president has been shot.  Your brother's dead.  And then hang up.  And then the next day he was at the racetracks,  you know what I mean?  Shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Didn't,  uh,  Robert Kennedy hate the fact that he had to hear that from,  uh,  from Hoover.  I heard he hated the fucking fact that Jay Edgar told him.  Yeah,  dude,  wouldn't you hate hearing about,  you know,  your family member dying by like someone you hate?  Yeah.  Someone you can't stand,  right?  And you know it's gloating.  Who might have had something to do with it.  Like those are sort of the,  the conspiracy theories,  you know?  Does it imply that at all in the film?  Do they at least,  or do they touch that or do they leave that alone?  They touch on the call. 
[03:18:00]  They touch on,  you know,  their very tense relationship,  but it doesn't,  it doesn't draw any conclusions.  Yeah.  I always thought it was kind of far fetched.  This movie sounds great.  Yeah.  I really want to see it,  especially with the guys playing,  you know,  you playing,  uh,  Tolson and of course DiCaprio.  Yeah.  DiCaprio nails it,  man.  He's incredible in the movie.  It's that great that DiCaprio takes a role like that.  It's not a sexy role.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's a powerful role,  but it's not a good looking,  you gotta ugly yourself up.  I like the fact that he did that.  Yeah.  Well,  this guy five other movies where he's going to be that guy.  Yeah.  That's true.  He's doing Gatsby at the same time where he's like,  he's going to be like, 
[03:18:30]  I know.  He wants to see what it's like to feel like me for 20 minutes.  How humiliating.  I hate him for that actually.  He's bored.  So he goes that way for a while and then he goes back to being the pretty boy.  Yeah.  That's still gotta be a nice choice to make.  Like I'm going to play some fucking kind of chubby,  ugly,  fucking rotten motherfucker.  And then I'll win everybody back with the,  I mean,  if I was Leo DiCaprio and like I had to be on point all the time,  I was like,  wait,  I can play this chubby dude.  I'm going to eat cheesesteaks every day.  Great.  I love this job.  I have an excuse.  Is there anybody you wouldn't play or is there any type of like, 
[03:19:00]  cause Kevin Bacon played a pedophile in the woodsman.  Yeah.  And he was very good.  That's good.  Yeah.  And it was a creepy,  uncomfortable role.  Totally.  Is there anything you wouldn't do that you're like,  eh,  I just couldn't.  No.  Oh,  you don't care.  No.  I mean,  I think,  you know,  I think it's silly to sort of put those sort of parameters on anything.  Like I,  I don't know,  man.  I,  before this,  I like,  I had reservations about playing a gay guy just cause I was like,  I don't know.  Like that's,  it's not me.  It's not it.  But then I was like,  you know what?  Now this is an opportunity.  Like,  and I'm an actor so I can do things in my,  you know,  professional life that I don't do in my personal life.  You know,  you can be conservative in your life and crazy in your art. 
[03:19:30]  You know,  do you create backstories?  Like I know Meryl Streep,  they said always has a secret that,  that her,  uh,  and you know,  that her character doesn't tell the other characters.  Do you do that?  Do you keep a secret from the other,  or do you create a backstory or do you just take it for what it is on the page?  I try to go about it a little differently.  I,  I sort of approach it as intellectually as possible.  Like,  uh,  I know a lot of acting is,  you know,  sort of about emotion and dealing with emotion,  but you know,  I think if you can understand who a character is and sort of where he comes from,  not just like what he did,  it helps you. 
[03:20:00]  Like,  I think that it's a good thing to be able to sort of assume the headspace of your character  as opposed to having to draw on like your own emotions all the time.  That can be really draining,  you know?  Plus a real guy like Tolson too,  there's actual real tape to go to.  and that dude had secrets anyway,  so I didn't have to actually make any up.  So did you watch video of him talking and stuff?  Was there anything hard in his mannerisms to,  uh,  uh,  to make your own?  Uh,  he's very like,  uh,  like the walk and everything is very like stilted and like tight and,  uh,  you know,  controlled and like,  uh,  I'm like typically a sloucher mostly. 
[03:20:30]  So it was like,  I'd always have to remind myself,  but it was helpful.  Why do you guys got to copy that shit?  No one knows.  The what?  I would just walk as me and go,  ah,  this is how he walked.  I don't understand the details sometimes that you guys go through.  Cause man,  we're actors.  We take this seriously.  I hear you're,  uh,  you're a gun enthusiast.  Yeah,  I do like guns.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's cool.  You guys can't really have guns in New York.  I don't think.  Oh boy,  you have no idea.  Please.  It might have a few. 
[03:21:00]  No,  no,  he might have a few.  This is the golden ticket,  my friend.  That's impossible.  It's a picture of the mayor blowing someone.  Dude.  That's impossible.  How did you get this?  Because I'm a radio personality.  I mean,  I've had death threats and things.  So they,  uh,  yeah.  From other people who work with them.  What do you carry?  Do you mind if I ask?  Uh,  uh,  yeah,  uh,  H and K 40.  Oh,  nice dude.  Yeah.  It's,  uh,  I heard you,  you,  you and your wife,  uh,  exchange gifts of,  of guns. 
[03:21:30]  We did.  Uh,  I thought it would be really funny when you were to give her a gun as a Christmas gift.  Like,  just like,  oh,  she's going to fucking flip.  This is going to be great.  And I hand her the present and then she hands me a present and I just shook it and I go,  this feels exactly like what I just handed you.  Multiple guns.  There you go.  That rules.  That's funny.  Yeah.  Damn.  I mean,  you both re-gifted it to other people.  What,  uh,  what do you,  what do you like shooting?  Uh,  anything and everything.  I got,  I have a little collection of handguns.  Uh,  I have like a great 1911,  a Kimber 45 that I love,  a six hour P226, 
[03:22:00]  a couple of rifles,  shotguns.  I picked up a,  a Barrett 50.  Yeah.  No way.  Take it out to Calverton.  Have you shot it yet?  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  What is it?  Is it like $3 a round?  It's about $4 and 50 cents a round.  It's,  it's Browning machine gun ammo.  Yeah.  Same thing.  They,  it's just off the chain and in a magazine.  That's fantastic.  And I shot one of those in Texas one time.  It's crazy.  I was saying the kick isn't bad.  It's the concussion.  Yeah.  Like blows your fucking flame that like scorches the earth in front of it.  I mean,  it's like,  it's like if someone's laying on the ground and they've got it on like the tripod and they're laying down, 
[03:22:30]  the gun is so heavy.  I mean,  I think that's why the recoil is not bad because it weighs like 70 pounds.  It's really heavy and the grip and where you put it and everything.  It's really stable,  but you can't do anything about just that much energy being released in your face like that.  It's like a stick of dynamite.  I was saying,  it feels like you have the flu for five seconds.  Oh yeah.  You get all kind of like,  well,  I don't know how the soldiers.  And they're popping up round after round after round.  Yeah.  After like five rounds, 
[03:23:00]  you start going,  hey,  you want to shoot this?  Yeah.  Anyone,  you want to do this?  I need a break.  No,  but it's crazy.  Like when you shoot it,  like the ground,  you know how it's like,  uh,  have you ever seen in the movies,  like when they do a big explosion and all the dust just looks like it raises anti-gravity?  It's like the ground does that around the gun.  And it's like,  and like a six foot flame shoots out the front of it.  And you can see like the mark on the ground where it's,  I mean,  it's incredible.  Well,  at least you didn't keep it in the irresponsible place.  You know,  your 50 cal.  I didn't walk in and see it on his fucking kitchen table.  Well,  it was, 
[03:23:30]  I was cleaning it.  You got to keep your guns clean,  especially your,  your automatics and your semis.  You got to keep those things clean.  I think that's what happens a lot of times when people like click,  click.  Yeah.  Like I always say,  you know,  thank God for that.  Because a lot of times,  you know,  bad people that shouldn't have guns that aren't allowed to have them technically.  Yeah.  They get a lot of misfires.  Yeah.  And it's like good because,  you know,  you don't usually see those guys going like,  yeah,  let me clean this.  Yeah.  Let me take this slide off.  Clean that.  Clean the action up.  Yeah.  It's just a gummy mess.  But no, 
[03:24:00]  I like,  I like the smell of a nice clean gun.  You open up the breech and get a little sniff in there.  That like Tetra gun oil smell.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That.  And after,  you know,  you shot it at the range,  so it's got a little powder smell to it.  That shit's great.  I'm glad.  Good.  Another second amendment.  Now you really like Army.  Man.  That's good.  Do you feel safe with your wife having a gun in the house?  Because if you're gone,  at least you know that she's got something there.  Yeah.  I mean,  we live in a building,  like an apartment building.  So it's,  I mean,  there's so many doors that,  you know,  people can pick to break into.  I'm sure statistically ours won't get chose. 
[03:24:30]  So I'm not that worried about it,  but I definitely do like,  you know,  I feel safer knowing that it's there.  You know,  women are dated.  I would feel just the opposite.  Knowing that it was there.  Yeah.  You don't have to point at me.  In the middle of a fucking argument.  It's horrifying.  You must really trust her.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do.  There's just,  it's just that situation.  And I only got her a 22,  so she really shoots me.  Maybe I have.  You might be able to walk it off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've,  I've always been from the school of,  you know,  I'd rather have one than not have one.  Sure.  And I think no matter how staunch anti-gun you are,  if a situation ever occurred where you're sitting there in your living room 
[03:25:00]  with phone cord around your,  your arms and watching your wife or daughter being ravaged,  the one thing you wish you had would be a gun.  That's dark,  dude.  I get it.  That's dark.  Yeah.  But you got to sometimes get that dark to make it real,  to make you realize like,  yeah,  you're so anti-gun,  but there's a time and a place for it.  Yeah.  You threw in all the hot stuff.  The hot things.  Being tied up and ravaged.  And I'm not,  I'm not a hunter either.  I don't like hunting.  I just like a target shooting. 
[03:25:30]  Do you hunt?  Target shooting.  No,  I'm like,  I'm,  I'm,  I like skeet shooting and I like target shooting and stuff like that.  It's a good challenge,  you know,  just to see if you can.  It's more fun.  And I mean,  you can go skeet shooting and shoot,  you know,  a couple hundred skeet.  And it's like,  you leave and you're like,  I didn't have to kill anything.  Yeah.  You didn't kill anything.  You're not sitting out in the cold.  Well,  the thing for me,  the thing where it's like,  I feel safer is I was in Australia working on a film and,  uh,  and I almost got stabbed by a homeless dude.  And like from that moment on,  I was like,  I never want to be the dude without the knife.  You know,  it's like,  like I didn't have any way to protect myself.  Like,  thankfully I dodged it when he stabbed at me and I punched him. 
[03:26:00]  He got knocked out.  What's the story?  I was,  uh,  we were in Australia.  We were in King's cross,  which is like the shady part of Australia.  Like what the meatpacking used to be like,  kind of thing.  Oh,  before it got all fancy and yucky.  Yeah.  I went out in the meatpack recently and I had like,  like nice jeans and like dress shoes on and like a coat.  And they're like,  sorry,  you can't come in.  You're wearing jeans.  I was like,  are you kidding me?  Like seriously?  This is meatpacking.  Yeah.  I know.  How awful is it to be down there now?  You did nothing to spend money on.  Oh,  really?  Yeah.  Anyway,  anyway,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah. 
[03:26:30]  I was down in King's cross and like we were,  we were walking around and,  uh,  and it was like me and like two of the actors from the movie and like this homeless guy  jumped up off the ground.  Like he was like passed out on the ground,  jumps up and like points in my face.  He goes,  I know you,  you owe me money.  And I was just,  and I,  and I literally,  I was down there and like we were doing justice league and I was playing Batman.  Uh,  the movie never ended up happening,  but I got to train for like two months and with like the Australian forces and like the  whole thing,  like doing gun drills and the whole thing.  And it was like,  ah,  it was like a kid's dream.  So the guy gets my face points.  He's like,  you owe me money.  And I was just like full of hubris. 
[03:27:00]  And I was just like,  fuck you dude.  And I just walked around him and like,  we kept walking and he comes back and he's like,  no,  I know you,  you owe me money.  And I was just like,  dude,  I like,  I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm not giving you shit.  So I walk around him again and then he gets in front of me the third time and he goes,  give me my money or I'm going to stab you.  And I look at him and I just go,  fuck you.  And he pulls out a knife.  I think he was like,  I think he was a little bit like heroin out and like he swung at me like this,  like at my face.  So it just happened like in,  in slow-mo where I was just like,  whoosh.  And then I just like clocked him. 
[03:27:30]  Like after he finished the swing,  he was like this.  And I just caught him.  His head just went,  holy shit.  He fell straight down onto the ground and,  and I stole his knife.  You took the knife?  I took the knife.  Good thing.  Probably saved somebody else from being stabbed.  This dude's going to go around trying to stab him.  He does not deserve to have this knife.  Not a smart move though,  because who knows what fucking DNA is on that knife.  And if you get picked up with it,  it's like,  no,  I stole it from a homeless man.  I didn't have a knife for you.  Sure you didn't.  We got the Yank murderer.  Yeah,  I heard that before.  Stole it from a homeless guy. 
[03:28:00]  Right.  Well,  Army,  man,  what a pleasure.  Yeah,  great,  man.  Thank you guys for having me back.  A lot of fun,  man.  I hope you come back to promote Mirror Mirror.  What the hell?  Even if it is a rom-com.  We're good.  We'll sell you some tickets.  All right,  cool.  But Jay Edgar is in theaters Friday.  Yeah,  it sounds great,  man.  It really does.  And our show is done?  Yeah,  I guess so.  Yes,  Jimmy,  I'm sure you have a plug-a-rooney,  as they say.  quickly,  this weekend,  Long Island,  early show Friday,  both shows Saturday sold out.  There's late show Friday tickets available.  And for the Borgata,  our second show for Antisocial is being added. 
[03:28:30]  It's myself,  Artie Lang,  Doug Stanhope,  and Dave Vittell.  That's January 15th.  Tickets on sale this Friday morning.  And I'm imagining it will sell out.  So hopefully you'll buy tickets.  Of course you're going to sell out.  I feel it.  Yes.  Artistically,  I have already.  Physically,  I want to as well.  All right,  we're done.  All right,  we'll see you next time.  All right,  brother?  Army Hammer,  everyone.  And now,  the Opie and Anthony show continues. 
[03:29:00]  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host,  Sam Roberts.  Well,  well,  well,  look who's still here.  Yeah.  Hi.  Anthony,  you're on After Opie and Anthony Live.  Shit show.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  I,  I did,  I'm not hanging out here.  Yes,  you are.  To,  you know,  be on your show.  Why are you saying it like that?  Well,  because,  all right,  I'm not hanging out here.  Be on your show.  I didn't have to say it like that. 
[03:29:30]  You're right.  I'm here  because  Roland says  that there is  a Call of Duty  game.  Yeah.  the new one,  the new one,  of course,  for me,  that is being sent here  at 10 o'clock.  Okay,  it's 8 after 10.  I know.  So he's running down now  to see if it came in the,  in the,  the mail thing.  Now,  the FedEx or UPS or something. 
[03:30:00]  In the history of the show,  as long as you've known Roland,  as long as,  the things that we've talked about Roland  being accurate on the show.  I know.  What in God's name  makes you think  that you're getting this game  at any time near 10 o'clock?  Hope,  Sam.  It's,  it's pure hope  that I have,  even though I know  beyond all odds  that there's really  no chance in hell.  Mm-hmm.  I have a better chance,  I mean,  E-Rock's got a better chance  of going to Conan.  Right.  Now,  today.  I was gonna say.  Oh, 
[03:30:30]  now Roland's coming back.  He's empty-handed.  Don't say anything bad about him  because he,  all of a sudden,  Roland's friend will have  Call of Duty.  And he'll say,  what,  Anthony,  you said you didn't  want it anymore.  I know,  you said you didn't want it.  He will do that.  He said,  you said you were  gonna go to Best Buy.  How come you're  so excited about it?  I thought you didn't  really like the  first-person shooter  on the controllers.  I suck at it.  Controllers.  I'm terrible on the  console game.  I like playing  a computer.  I like playing  with a mouse and keyboard  those games  because I'm much  more accurate.  But,  I still,  I'm just a sucker for it. 
[03:31:00]  I gotta go on Xbox  and I gotta get killed  like a fucking  noob.  Mr.  Noob.  Mr. Empty Hands  would like to say something.  to you.  They're separating  the mail right now.  What?  Blacks and whites.  Oh,  is that how they  separate it these days?  How do they separate?  Can't they just  dig through it  and find that one?  How about  important mail  versus unimportant mail  which is yours?  That's how the guy  goes,  there's a lot of mail  we go through right now.  That's a break  for tomorrow though.  This is show related.  Yeah,  so you can tell  you about when  you go to Best Buy  and buy it.  I talk about it. 
[03:31:30]  Guess what?  The mail guy  gets nothing from that.  Like,  oh,  Anthony Cooney's  going to talk about  what I gave him.  I have to make sure  this is first.  Look,  I don't like the fact  that just because  you stand there  during this show  which is supposedly yours  that you can sit here  and bash me.  I can because you're  in a moment of vulnerability.  I really am.  And you have set up  the show  to make it so  that when you come in here  in this moment.  I know.  You know,  my first job as an intern  was to buy you  a video game.  I know.  It's usually  part of the intern's duties 
[03:32:00]  to go out and find  Did you succeed?  you would fail.  Did you succeed?  I succeeded,  but I was bummed out  because I got back  at like,  10.02.  The show had just  been off the air.  Yes, yes.  So you were happy  with me,  but I didn't get  that air time.  No one knew  that I was happy  with you.  You want air time?  Roland?  I did.  Now it's no big deal.  I begged her  to send it overnight.  She said,  it's overnight.  You'll get it  in the morning  of the 8th.  No.  Wait, wait, wait.  The morning of the 8th.  You know what that means.  It's still two more hours.  Sometime before noon. 
[03:32:30]  But usually,  but FedEx  has arrived right now,  though,  the first drop-off.  Usually.  If I fucking leave  and have to look  at a picture  that's tweeted  of you guys  holding that fucking game up,  I'm really going to be pissed.  that got sent here,  and I sent you a picture  saying,  look what we just got  in the way.  And it was like  11 o'clock.  It's going to happen.  Now,  it's for Xbox,  you said, right?  Yeah.  I have PlayStation.  Otherwise,  I would make sure  to be tweeting pictures  of me playing the game  all day.  Travis,  you have Xbox.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[03:33:00]  Are you a Call of Duty fan?  Big time.  Roland?  Oh, yeah.  Who gets the game  when Anthony leaves?  No, it's not  if I leave,  I forfeit the game  arrangement.  If you leave  two minutes later  when the game arrives,  somebody else should get it.  This isn't an E-Rock  saying he doesn't  want to go deal.  See?  He's clear.  He's clear.  I want the game.  Okay, so if you want  the game,  when we get it,  you can come back  and get the game.  Would you do that?  I'm not going to drive  back to the city.  Why don't you go  to Compound East? 
[03:33:30]  Uh-huh.  Hang out at Compound East  for a while.  You got an Xbox there?  Well, that's Compound West.  Oh, Compound West.  Yeah, yeah.  Compound West.  So you should get  an Xbox at Compound West.  I should.  Roland, can they  overnight an Xbox?  But get in here  for this morning.  For this morning.  God, I know  the second I walk  out of here.  Yeah, it's going to be.  That's the dilemma  you're in.  It's not going to get here.  While you're still here,  it won't arrive.  And, by the way,  Kenny's waiting  out in the truck for me 
[03:34:00]  with the clock ticking  because he doesn't  want to sit out there  waiting in my truck.  And he's listening to this.  Yes.  All right, Kenny,  I'm coming down.  Oh, boy.  I'm coming down, Kenny.  That means the game  will be here  before the after show  is over.  I know.  But since it's important  to the show,  we should messenger it  to him.  Yeah.  You think so?  Messenger it to my house.  Okay.  I should take the headphones off  before I leave.  No, bring them with you.  The show is going  on the road.  All right.  We have to get this game.  This IGN  gave it a nine.  A nine out of how many? 
[03:34:30]  Ten.  That's 90%.  It's amazing.  That's what it says.  Amazing.  That's the score.  I know.  That's an A.  It's amazing.  Oh, here comes,  maybe Spencer's got the game.  Does Spencer have...  We've got it.  No.  Spencer.  All right.  I'll see you later.  No game.  Spencer works in talent booking  and he's just walking around  going,  what?  Anthony's leaving.  As soon as the game  gets here.  First of all,  Travis,  who's actually going to  bring it home?  Because it's not staying here.  It's not Anthony's game anymore.  I don't think any games  are coming today.  You think Roland made  the whole thing up?  I don't think he necessarily 
[03:35:00]  made the whole thing up,  but I don't think  there's going to be  any games today.  Eric...  I hope there is  because I would love a game.  In your experience...  And you will be getting a game.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I understand.  Eric, in your experiences,  do you think a game  is coming to the studio today?  I'll say this.  When Roland says  some stuff is coming,  it usually does.  It just doesn't come  in the time frame  that either they told him  or he estimated in his head.  So are we saying...  It did come last year,  so, you know...  So are we saying...  Yeah, I'm not doubting  that it's not coming.  But are we...  Is it going to come today? 
[03:35:30]  Probably.  You were probably right.  We might be here  closer to 12.  Oh, boy.  You know Anthony  is going to go to Best Buy  right now, too.  And he's just going to...  He's just going to regret  because as soon as  he purchases the game,  he'll get a text.  My hope is that  we have the game  before he gets to Best Buy.  That would be great.  Or at least, like,  while he's online  at Best Buy.  Oh, a text.  Yeah.  What's this?  Travis?  I like Travis.  No!  No! 
[03:36:00]  If I had just waited...  But then it would...  He would have to stay  in this building.  I mean, already.  What if we just have Matt...  Almost 10-12.  What if we have Matt  stand by the office  for the rest of the time here  and let us know  if a FedEx shipment comes in?  Here's what I want to happen with.  What if the FedEx shipment  went to the office already,  no one was there  to sign for it?  And then they said,  well, we'll be back tomorrow.  Well, then we'll have to call him  and let him know.  Here's what we should do.  We should get the game,  give it to Matt  to bring to Anthony's house  and then we'll tell Matt, 
[03:36:30]  Matt, what Anthony wants you to do  is sneak into his bedroom window  and give it to him that way  and then, fingers crossed,  there'll be a case  of mistaken identity  and Anthony will shoot Matt  in the face  and kill him.  And hopefully,  that'll happen.  Is that...  See, that's going too far.  I can't allow that.  Well, no,  because it's off  the jurisdiction of intern.  The killing part.  Like, maybe maimed,  but not dead.  Eric has strict rules  against killing interns.  Yes.  Maiming is fine. 
[03:37:00]  In that situation,  yeah, he could be,  you know, crippled maybe.  Well, how about  if he shoots him in the jaw  and just blows up his face  beyond recognition,  but is still technically alive?  And he has to wear,  like, a fake face  like the guy  in Boardwalk Empire?  Exactly.  He's...  Spoiler.  Yeah, that's a big...  I haven't seen that.  You haven't seen that one?  I haven't seen it.  The show.  So, halfway through season two,  we can't mention a character.  That's not an arc.  You don't see him  get his face blown off.  Now I know.  Now that's a spoiler. 
[03:37:30]  Now when he comes on the screen,  I'm going to say,  ah.  Yeah.  I knew that already.  I knew that was coming.  I know.  I know.  You'll watch the premiere  and you'll be like,  where is he?  Well, I know  that these are not  all the characters  that this series  is going to have for me.  Speaking of characters,  how about that Armie Hammer?  We were talking about him  during the break.  First of all,  he's in J. Edgar  that's coming out  on Friday  and there's a lot  of discussion  in the interview  about his on-screen  same-sex  lip lock 
[03:38:00]  kiss  with Leonardo DiCaprio.  Now,  I mean,  you should know by now  if you're a fan of the show,  I have no problems  with a same-sex kiss  for the sake of performance.  Because you're gay?  Matt.  What is he doing?  Who gave you permission?  You speak when spoken to.  Out.  You're out.  You're out.  You're out.  You're out.  Whoa.  You're out.  Sal will finish the cleanup.  You're out the room.  You have to understand,  that just put us over the top  for intern Matt today. 
[03:38:30]  You said you want to kill.  Out the room.  I do.  Out the room.  Now I want it even more.  You know,  if he was smart,  he would use this kind of excuse  to get out of doing any work?  Right.  But he doesn't realize that.  Now he's going to sit in there with you.  Now he's sulking  that he's not cleaning up.  Hopefully,  now the new fantasy is  Eric just has a gun  onto the console  and shoots Matt in the face  for no reason  to death and kills him.  He's in there.  Perfect.  Hopefully the next step  is getting shot.  But yeah,  as I was saying  before I was so rudely interrupted  by that very dumb intern,  I obviously have no problem 
[03:39:00]  with a same-sex kiss  when it's for the sake of performances.  For the show.  For the show.  As it were.  For the movie.  But, like,  I can't help  getting jealous  when I hear that  a Hollywood actor  Is kissing men?  Like Armie Hammer.  No.  No.  Like Armie Hammer,  when it's time for him  to have a same-sex kiss,  gets to do it  with somebody  like Leonardo DiCaprio,  and for the show,  I'm stuck  with people 
[03:39:30]  like a homeless man  and intern David  and Bob Kelly.  Bob Kelly's  not bad.  He's an actor.  Is he?  I've seen him on TV.  Okay.  Well, that's a totally  different thing.  Yes.  He was in Curb Your Enthusiasm.  I know.  I'm not saying he hasn't  been on shows  pretending to be somebody else.  Before anybody  calls him an actor,  let's back the truck up.  He was a ghost  in that Ricky Gervais movie.  It's just unfair  that, like,  you know,  my skills for  same-sex kisses  for the sake of performance  could be used 
[03:40:00]  to kiss people  like Leonardo DiCaprio.  Do you want us to book you,  like,  an attractive man  to kiss?  Like,  an attractive famous man?  Well,  maybe to his friends.  Uh, yeah.  I mean,  it'd be better  because,  you know,  at least they're attractive.  But Leonardo DiCaprio,  would you,  would you,  uh,  kiss Leonardo DiCaprio  not for a movie  but for,  for kicks?  For, like,  this radio show,  not for Opie and Anthony,  but for the sake of entertainment  on the after show,  would you?  You're not even gonna bring this  to the Opie and Anthony show? 
[03:40:30]  No, it's not.  This is like,  because that's, like,  too big of a,  of a platform to put you on.  Like,  if this were on just  after Opie and Anthony live,  would you,  uh,  kiss Leonardo DiCaprio  for, like,  seven seconds?  Yeah.  Me too.  Yeah.  Me too.  Um,  Eric.  Armie Hammer, too.  You,  well,  why?  Because he's gonna be a big star.  Who wants the three-person kiss?  Triple kiss!  Armie Hammer and Leonardo DiCaprio  were like,  we're here to talk about the movie.  Look,  you see the movies he's gonna be in,  he's gonna be a big star. 
[03:41:00]  So you wanna kiss him?  Yeah,  so I can say,  oh,  you remember Armie Hammer?  Okay,  so you,  you just wanna kiss famous people then?  Yes.  Now,  what if it were not?  And people that are going to be famous.  What if it were not on the after show?  If it were,  like,  in the hallway,  and you said,  hey,  Armie,  thanks for coming by,  then would you kiss him on the lips?  If he,  if I thought that he would reciprocate?  Yeah.  Yeah,  sure.  He would make,  he would make a move.  Yeah.  This is kinda like you and Danny  sending those shirtless pictures to each other.  Well,  he sends them to me,  I've never sent him a shirtless picture. 
[03:41:30]  Well,  you're still playing a little coy and hard to get,  but,  the fact that you seem to be a gay man,  uh,  I understand you're married,  uh,  I understand you have a child,  but I understand the same things were true about,  uh,  McGreevy and various other people throughout history  that are,  uh,  actually homosexuals.  Look,  if,  if thanking Armie Hammer for coming in  with a nice sensual kiss  is gonna get us more guests.  It's sensual now.  I thought it was before,  no?  So if Roland came to you,  like,  he goes to Opie and Anthony, 
[03:42:00]  and he goes,  look,  you know,  I know he's only like a,  you know,  a bit part in this,  not Armie Hammer,  but somebody like,  we've done it before,  I don't wanna mention names  because that'll ruin relationships,  but we'll take guests,  like,  I know you don't know who this guy is,  but he's gonna be in a movie  with this big star,  and maybe,  maybe Mark Wahlberg will come in  if you take this guest.  So if Roland was like,  look,  Travis,  you know,  I know,  whatever,  but Armie Hammer is doing a,  a movie with Johnny Depp,  and maybe if you kiss him,  it was sensually,  we could get Johnny Depp in here 
[03:42:30]  because he'll say,  there's a really good kisser  as one of the producers.  Would you then say,  well,  that's my job.  If that's something that Johnny Depp  might be interested in,  like,  hey,  uh,  Armie,  I'm gonna do some interviews,  who likes to kiss,  then yeah,  I would have to do it.  You would do it,  Travis.  Would it also lead to,  you know,  Travis getting to kiss Johnny Depp?  Oh,  that's a good question.  No,  that's what I'm saying  because the whole pitch  would now be,  go on this show,  the producer is a good kisser,  so Johnny Depp would do the interview, 
[03:43:00]  but it's not,  we're not selling it  on the fact that we're a good interview.  It's that one of the producers  after the interview  is a good kisser,  so you would obviously  have to also kiss Johnny Depp,  that would be okay.  Johnny Depp,  absolutely,  he's a good looking guy.  What the hell?  And he supported  the West Memphis Three,  which I also do.  So by that same logic,  let's celebrate,  you would kiss  for the West Memphis Three,  so Eddie Vedder,  if you saw him on the street,  you'd kiss him centrally.  He's too cool.  He's too cool to kiss? 
[03:43:30]  But he supported  the West Memphis Three.  That's true.  What if he was like,  hey,  Travis,  do you want to kiss?  I'd be like,  yeah.  You'd say yes.  And he'd be like,  well,  too bad,  I'm a heterosexual.  And he'd be like,  oh no,  I look like,  I'm so stupid  in front of my idol.  Then he probably  wouldn't take a picture  with me.  No.  He'd be like,  I'm not going to take a picture  with you,  kissy boy.  Eric,  are there any men,  like,  and this is not a gay thing,  are there any men  who you admire 
[03:44:00]  from Hollywood  or whatever,  who,  if they wanted to,  you would kiss?  I know one.  Who?  Hulk Hogan.  Would you kiss?  You would kiss Hulk Hogan.  If Hulk Hogan,  okay,  Eric,  if Hulk Hogan  were in here right now,  he's like,  well,  you know something,  brother,  what I'd really like  to do right now  is find the biggest  Hulkamaniac in the room  and give him  a big wet kiss  on the lips.  Would you be like,  would you be yelling,  Sam is nowhere near  as big a Hulkamaniac  as I am.  Get him out of there.  Would you come in 
[03:44:30]  for the big Hulkamaniac kiss?  I'd have to.  He would.  Do you think Eric  would rip his shirt off  like the Hulk  and get a kiss?  No, no, no.  Eric would get the kiss  and then he'd go,  and he'd rip off his shirt  and he'd flex  and everybody would be like,  Eric,  you just kissed Hulk Hogan  for no reason.  But yeah,  but you know what Eric would say?  No,  there was a reason.  Yeah.  Just like,  it was because  the biggest Hulkamaniac  gets a big wet kiss  from Hulk Hogan's mustache.  What about you,  Ron Afez,  intern?  Not negative.  I wouldn't kiss any man.  No way. 
[03:45:00]  I don't care for the show,  whatever,  unless you gotta pay me  some serious money  in order to do so.  Gay for pay.  What if it was,  yeah,  are you gay for pay?  Yeah,  I'm all for it.  Gay for pay.  Gay for pay,  all for it,  100%.  That's the way I need the money.  There's no way.  Eric,  would you make sure  that Ron Afez's producers  know that their intern  is gay for pay?  Will do.  Sean from Cape Cod  says,  you asses are  actually discussing  kissing men  on a national platform.  What the hell  is wrong with you?  We're trying to get top-notch guests.  And two people  have already asked 
[03:45:30]  Travis  if he would kiss Fez  because Fez is famous.  Fez is a famous  radio personality.  Would it get him  on the show?  If Fez did  the Opie and Anthony show,  would you kiss him?  If he would come  to our Hard Rock event,  maybe.  Okay.  Well,  I think  it's only fair then  isolating that.  There needs to be  some kind of  man-on-man kiss  at the Hard Rock.  And I've certainly  done my share  of man-on-man kissing  for the show.  Maybe even Bobo  could kiss someone.  I don't know.  Is Bobo going to be there? 
[03:46:00]  Will he be at the Hard Rock?  I'm asking you.  Oh, yeah.  He'll be there.  He will.  Because he'll kiss men, too.  He told me he has  his VIP  or his RSVP  all taken care of.  Oh, thank God.  He's not booked.  No, no, no.  He's not booked.  He's going to be there  as a fan.  This is a great question.  Rich in Ohio.  Yeah, Sam,  I was wondering,  did you find out  that Andy Samberg  is planning on going gay  and that's why  we're all having  to listen to this today  because you're going  to be into the punch? 
[03:46:30]  Listen,  Andy Samberg may now  decide to go on SNL  and do a skit  about kissing men  because he's ripped  me off before  and he's obviously  ripped me off again.  But no, Rich,  I don't know what  Andy Samberg is doing.  Eric,  I want you  to play what we  while Rick  because if you  remember,  it was only  a few weeks ago  when I exposed  to the world  that Andy Samberg  had stolen  one question 
[03:47:00]  with a guest  we couldn't get  calling it  a brief interview.  It was on  Saturday Night Live  and he did  a brief interview  with Drake  which was just like  my one question  with a guest  we couldn't get  that I've been doing  for over a year  except less funny  because he cut it  off before the answer.  The whole point  of the bit  is that the guest  expects there to be  a second question  and then you get  to hear the  uncomfortability  of the interview ending.  If Andy Samberg  wanted to apologize  with a sensual smooch 
[03:47:30]  would you accept?  I wouldn't.  Would you?  What if  if you found out  Andy Samberg,  Travis,  was willing to come  on the show  to apologize to me  but he wanted  the producer  to give him  a nice kiss  before he came on  would you kiss  Andy Samberg?  Wait,  that's what he wants?  That's what Andy Samberg wants.  He wants to apologize  to you so badly.  But no,  no,  he's willing  to apologize  but first  he wants a kiss  from the producer.  Would you kiss him 
[03:48:00]  so then he would  come on and apologize  to me?  No.  Why?  Don't care.  Would you kiss him  just cause?  Maybe goodbye.  Maybe goodbye.  Maybe if he was  going somewhere,  I don't know.  Maybe after I turn him  down I'd be like  sorry that didn't work out.  Here's a kiss.  So Andy Samberg  rips off  my one question  completely  and this wasn't  something that I made up.  This was brought  to my attention  cause I'm not gonna  sit at home  watching Andy Samberg  skits.  Nobody does.  He is yesterday's news 
[03:48:30]  ever since  the Cupcake song.  It's all been downhill  for Andy Samberg.  What's the Cupcake song?  You know,  with Chris Parnell  the first like big  Andy Samberg  is a funny guy  who raps.  Lazy Sunday.  Exactly.  Ever since then  it's been downhill  for the guy.  He can't sell movie tickets  let's be honest about that.  Now  he's run out of ideas  completely  in terms of  Saturday Night Live  and so he's going  to the Sam Roberts  playbook.  What bits does Sam Roberts  have going on?  Those are the ones  that I will use on SNL.  Do you think he'll start  kissing guys now 
[03:49:00]  on Saturday Night Live?  No, he will start  talking about them  and trying to convince  Horatio Sands  or whoever is the Travis  of Saturday Night Live  to kiss guys instead.  I don't know.  I always assumed  Horatio Sands  but I don't really know.  He's not on the show anymore.  Well, who knew?  Who knew?  It'd be good if all that guy  was the Travis.  Kenan Thompson.  Yeah, he'll convince  Kenan to start kissing men.  Now, Eric,  I need you to play for me.  What's wrong?  A message from Andy.  From Andy Samberg.  You got a message  from Andy Samberg, Rowan. 
[03:49:30]  What does Andy Samberg  have to say?  Fuck you,  whoever your name is, Sam.  Yeah.  I create everything.  You're nothing.  Oh, he said that!  You piece of shit.  He texted you that!  Not texting me, email, sir.  He emailed you that.  Yeah.  Well, tell him I said this.  You wouldn't even know  what to say  if it wasn't for this mouth  because all you do  is copy it  and ask to kiss it.  He said you would say that  and he just said  you're a nobody.  Tell him he wants...  Say enjoy your shit show.  No, I will...  That's a long text.  You know what shit...  That is a long text. 
[03:50:00]  Oh, it was an email.  You know what shit show  I don't enjoy?  Four paragraphs.  You know what shit show  I don't enjoy?  Saturday Night Live.  Saturday Night Live.  That's the shit show  I don't enjoy.  He said enjoy your  WWE LOL.  Oh, shit, man.  I mean, I do enjoy it.  He hopes you enjoy your wrestling.  I will.  I mean, I appreciate  that sentiment at least.  What's Andy Samberg?  He doesn't hit 100%.  He doesn't?  No, no.  Did he mention anything  about kissing?  He said he will  fuck you in the ass.  I'm not down with that. 
[03:50:30]  I just got a text  from Andy Samberg  that says he is  unwilling to apologize  but will accept  a kiss from Travis.  Now, Eric...  Only if he chaves.  I want you...  Are the games here yet?  Yeah, are the games  here for Anthony?  The mail guy,  they're going through  a bunch.  So, no.  Eric, play for me.  Last week, I believe it was.  Yeah, last Wednesday.  Last Wednesday.  This is when everybody's  writing their little skits  for Saturday night.  Actually, you're right.  That's when they read  the script, though. 
[03:51:00]  Right.  And he's like, hey...  Well, actually,  they read it at noon,  so they finished writing,  so they could...  So they came for me.  He was listening  until 11 on this show.  Play for me, Eric,  my brilliant  Chris Humphrey's impression.  Okay.  I love how Sam calls her...  That was his idea.  What?  I don't know.  Roland's just talking shit again.  Go ahead.  Hold on.  I love how Sam calls  Chris Humphrey's a dope, though.  He's a moron.  Have you seen him?  He's just,  hello, it's me,  Chris Humphrey. 
[03:51:30]  He's just along for the ride.  They're just telling him  all kinds of bullshit.  Okay.  Like, he hasn't processed  that there's cameras around him.  He's an adult.  And he's just like,  okay, of course I'll marry you, Kim.  Like, great.  There.  There it is.  That's the Chris Humphrey's impression.  Yeah, but someone did it for you.  I'm not saying  there's never been  a Chris Humphrey's impression before.  I'm just saying, though.  I'm not saying I invented  the concept of...  By the way,  Caretop is no hair.  Don't be Carlos Messia.  I'm not saying  I invented the concept... 
[03:52:00]  Why do you insist  on coming on this show  and insulting  Jackie the Joke Man?  Don't be Colin Cain.  Now you're just taking out  your personal vendetta.  Cain Proud.  I kid.  Jesus, Roland.  Get out of here  before you get yourself in trouble.  I love Colin.  He knows that.  No, you don't.  I love Colin.  LOL.  Listen,  now that you've heard that,  this is the quintessential  Chris Humphrey's impression.  Okay?  The Sam Roberts-Chris Humphrey's.  Uh, okay.  I don't know, Kim.  You want to get married?  Uh, mm-hmm.  Now listen to this  from Saturday Night Live.  Join the Kardashians 
[03:52:30]  as they cope  with the pain of divorce  all night long.  we may even hear from chris humphries uh that's it that's my impression he just sat there going  that's the same thing as sitting there going except with less emotion in his voice that's my  chris humphries impression will make you happy what can he do to make you happy andy just admit  that that's where he got it from and then i'll be happy and also my mother would really like it if 
[03:53:00]  he could send some of my stuff to tina fey because my mother has always thought that i should send my  stuff to tina fey do you think he actually knows tina fey you don't think so no yeah if he had uh  i bet if andy samberg knew uh tina fey he'd probably get more breaks than hot rod  a movie so bad even we couldn't sell tickets to it when we put we couldn't come up with a contest  for sure we did we put cream pie jones in briefs and then put and then put icy hot on his nutsack  that's weird okay the six guys listen it's it's clear to me and i hope it's clear to all of you 
[03:53:30]  out there i mean you heard my chris humphries impression okay this is from this week saturday  night live live by the way as they always advertise it is live on saturday night from rockefeller center  i did my impression on wednesday and now i hear this from of all people andy samberg  join the kardashians as they cope with the pain of divorce all night long we may even hear from 
[03:54:00]  chris humphries that's mine that's my impression well with the haps from 30 rock where do you think  tina got it from okay but we love her though i love tina fey and you know what tina fey can use any  of my stuff and my mom told me always be nice when it comes to talking about tina fey because one day  you're going to want to send her your stuff i don't know what my mom's thing is with tina fey  but she's convinced that tina fey is running hollywood you know why she's one of the gals 
[03:54:30]  she is one of the gals but andy samberg he stole the impression okay he stole my uh one question  interviews it's obvious that he's the one who heard ona talking about catchphrase comedy and wrote the  kings of catchphrase comedy he stole that andy samberg is sitting there do something now so you can see if he  stole it for next week you think just come up with something brilliant and then we'll see it on  saturday night live i want just andy samberg he doesn't have to apologize he doesn't have to 
[03:55:00]  kiss me he could kiss travis only if he wants because travis will accept it all i want  was that a fart that's like he was he's been doing that that sounds like a small animal he wasn't even  on mike the mike was by your mouth he was doing it while you were doing your asshole  you how could that happen oatmeal oatmeal this is why i scream at him in the office oh my god you're  not a healthy person no no shit i hope there's no shit it sounded like there might be though there 
[03:55:30]  probably is a mark a little bit a little skin mark in the underpants it's like a like the  aren't you like a little sergeant stripe all i'm asking is for andy samberg to simply reach out on  on twitter or text roland send him an email he's a talent booker after all and just say hey it's me  andy samberg just wanted to admit i want to kiss you most of the funny things that i've done recently 
[03:56:00]  i've stolen from sam roberts and if travis is still willing to kiss i'm up for it both those things  from andy samberg and then i will be satisfied but until then he's on the celebrity shit list  along with guy fieri who's still there and he is not getting taken off right now the sam roberts  celebrity shit list includes andy samberg and guy fieri and that's it right now army hammer it's quite  a celebrity list you have there they're not big celebrities travis i'll admit that they're horrible 
[03:56:30]  horrible celebrities one goes to diners and dresses like steve c and the other simply can't  sell movie tickets and has to pray that they just keep renewing that snl contract because guess  what nobody's gonna pay nine dollars or twelve dollars or whatever it is you kids are paying  to go into a movie theater and see two hours of you singing songs with justin timberlake and it's  about all you're doing okay so you're gonna have to realize that snl is where it starts and stops  oh this is unbelievable i'm so glad this show is so high profile andy samberg is on the air 
[03:57:00]  andy samberg welcome to after open anthony live yeah heard someone talking shit about me  yes andy uh i need you to admit that you're stealing all your material from me  yeah now that you're stealing your material from me how you're stealing material from me now you're  just literally doing this look andy you can't look andy i'm gonna hang up on you andy you can't call  here and he has a chicago accent and just repeat yeah eric he's from chicago huh he didn't mention a 
[03:57:30]  kiss well i hung up on him don't get all excited but i will tell you this travis if you're looking  to get a kiss from somebody guy or girl the way to their hearts is through by the way after open  anthony live i should mention is brought to you by trojan bearskin condoms trojan america's number  one most trusted condom brand but as i was saying well a kiss could lead to that a kiss could lead to  are you are you more like angry like guy fieri vodka angry or worse um i would i'm putting that 
[03:58:00]  that's why that's how guy fieri it's america made it to my celebrity shit list and also because he  dresses like steve c um you think steve's just really jealous about yeah he see steve job the guy  has steve thinks that guy fieri stole everything from him because of the wardrobe minus the pounds  um i hate and dress terribly too uh i i would say they're on equal footing right now i would say 
[03:58:30]  uh andy sandberg more so because he's more recent in my mind than guy fieri i'm kind of you know guy  fieri he's yesterday's news but as i was saying travis is looking to get a kiss because we talked  about the condoms before you can get the condoms you need the kiss okay and if you're looking to get  a kiss from a guy or a girl you're gonna need to buy him a gift like argentium for instance  what is argentium you ask silver yes it's not just it's no no no wrong it's silver but it's not 
[03:59:00]  just any silver it's super silver it's steven singer's brand new super silver collection uh it starts  at just 149 that's it that's like nothing for super silver it's uh more pure than sterling silver  it's brighter than platinum white gold and sterling so it's more pure than sterling it's brighter than  sterling it's the best silver you can get look the thing about steven singer is he can get you out  of trouble he not only can he get you he'll tell you what to buy your significant other but he can 
[03:59:30]  get you out of trouble because go down there to the other corner of eighth and walnut that's what i did  and bring your your lady travis in your case your boyfriend whoever you're with your partner  your wife and and let them pick out some stuff they want you don't have to buy it now because steven  singer keeps a little list for you and the next time you're in deep shit and you need to dig your  way out of a hole because let's face it sometimes we do things that need fixing you just call steven 
[04:00:00]  singer at 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER or you can go to the website probably I HATE-STEVEN-SINGER.COM  and you just say like for me the guy i deal with there is turbo joe he's the man and i go joe  you remember what jess put on the list that ring or that necklace i need something i'm in dutch joe  and i need something that's going to help me out he'll help you out there's a million things go  there now i hate steven singer.com 1-888-I-HATE-STEVEN-SINGER or in person like i do on the other corner of  eighth and walnut in philadelphia it's i hate steven singer argentium and a whole lot more eric wants 
[04:00:30]  to know if you kissed turbo joe i've never kissed turbo joe what if he's gonna like bump up the carrot  sometimes he's like look sam for the amount of money you want to offer i can give you two  carrots but two carrots turns to two and a half with a simple kiss on the lips it's never come up  i mean if that were the situation maybe but it's simply never come up um the other thing with army 
[04:01:00]  hammer i can't believe we i mean we ended up i was just trying to talk about army hammer and travis  turns it all into kissing he's just i think that's what i did yeah he's just you just come in here and  talk about kissing is that i mean i can't even believe that this guy you know what i was going  to talk about how handsome he was but we can't talk about that there's too much gay stuff going on in  this show i will say though in the movie i'm not even going to talk about it he still what he still  has a lot of scenes from leo oh really yeah because you because you look at leo okay it's leo but  army you don't look at him like oh that's army um because the makeup and everything he looks 
[04:01:30]  totally different and and they have to age them throughout the oh he said he goes from his  20s to his 70s when he's in his 70s he's it's amazing well j edgar is out uh this friday and  tomorrow limited theaters oh it's starting tomorrow's wednesday limited yeah new york and then  open what is it open open wide open friday wide yeah there you go open friday wide  open wide um yeah uh and also we should mention that we lost joe frazier who is just i mean 
[04:02:00]  well he's i don't know if he's buried yet but he's certainly in a box by now uh he had lung cancer  or liver cancer and he died i think last night or something i don't know but um he was a riot when  he was in here uh obviously one of the greatest boxers of all time but he just hung out he was  singing songs he was talking shit about ali and how how pissed must joe frazier have been when he 
[04:02:30]  was on his deathbed and realized that as much because he said that god punished ali for calling  himself the greatest and for his ego and for the things he did joe frazier said god had punished ali  how do you think joe frazier felt when he was sitting on his deathbed or i should probably  laying on his deathbed realizing that ali's gonna outlive me god damn it muhammad ali as much 
[04:03:00]  trouble as his life has been the last few years is outliving smoking joe frazier in the  he wins it again ali beats frazier again and it's like what do you think ali chuckled a little  when he heard the news got that idiot again just said horrible things about him because muhammad ali  hurt joe frazier's feelings it wasn't the beatings in the ring that that got joe frazier so upset it  was that he hurt his feelings and now joe frazier has to go before ali um and as sad as it is because 
[04:03:30]  i mean i guess it's not you know i we didn't know him but he was in studio for whatever it was an hour  at time and uh he was hilarious but when you look at him like we have other boxers in we have younger  boxers bernard hopkins has been in a bunch of times uh roy jones jr's been in floyd mayweather's  been in sugar ray leonard sugar ray leonard even that works too has he been in yeah or has he's yeah 
[04:04:00]  yes no no he's been in when yeah i was in over at k rock oh that's right because we couldn't talk  about the you know what yeah hello the what i call bring it back around yeah yeah we couldn't bring up  his travis problem if you know what i mean but um like young boxers now for whatever yeah uh t hoover  here yeah t hoover i just wanted to help the show t stands for travis i didn't say that and the gay 
[04:04:30]  guy um but uh young boxers would uh they're i think boxing has changed quite a bit because  they're they're being very careful now like joe frazier was in here he died at 67 i could have sworn  he was 87 when he was in this studio like those guys got punched out and ali obviously punched out  like like i mean their bodies are weathered their brains are cottage cheese at this point like they 
[04:05:00]  were taking some shots i don't follow boxing anymore not that i ever did before but i don't  follow boxing now but it seems to me like floyd mayweather is in here making it rain like he's got  a snappy little comeback for everything bernard hopkins is all over the place like you know roy jones  jr sugar ray leonard oscar de la hoya they all have their facilities they all look like they just  came from a spa and got a facial not that kind of facial you disgusting opian anthony channel listeners 
[04:05:30]  they all look like a million bucks travis you like sports is boxing do you watch boxing no  has boxing changed to that extent but i don't think they fight as much i could be totally wrong is that  what it is just less fights so less welts because like ufc fighters they come in here and like they  have cauliflower ear all sports are less violent now i mean that's just the way it is yeah like  you know baseball there used to be you know collisions at home plate football i guess it's true  anything i mean hockey can't yeah hockey you can't check hard they didn't even wear you know helmets 
[04:06:00]  until when oh god i'm just getting uh feedback that uh samberg is debuting a new muhammad ali impression  on saturday night live this week this is terrible uh like i guess back then when fraser and ali were  fighting people thought a concussion and a headache were kind of like a concussion headache what  difference does it make just keep fighting whereas now it's like a serious thing but i mean it's it's  amazing that you know joe fraser did not look healthy when we saw him and it's not it's boxing it has 
[04:06:30]  to be yeah but george foreman did eric got a picture with him that's true eric is limp wristed  punching picture that he got with him joe fraser uh not joe fraser george foreman when you talk to  him um he's still all there he's still there and he had major fights yeah but i guess because he was  so much bigger than everybody and he didn't have the real master he didn't have to take that much  punishment did joe did did george foreman just not take as much punishment because he's bigger than  everybody just knock people out joe fraser's oh good i was gonna say this is a room of three people 
[04:07:00]  who know nothing about boxing i look what i know is i see people come in here and they look  healthy and i see people come in here and they don't look healthy what about chris brown he looks  healthy yeah he he did more of the hitting than getting hit um eric what time what are we working  on with time you got about two minutes oh okay i thought we had a triple here yeah we are but you  got about uh two minutes oh okay good i was worried that we were you were just slacking behind the board 
[04:07:30]  there no i have a clip of um fraser talking about george foreman it's 40 seconds he's saying how uh  he was afraid of george foreman because george hurt everybody he punched well now we know what  he says so no reason to play it john and thank you though john in jersey hey sam hey listen the  reason these pretty boy boxers today are uh they haven't retired yet once they retire that's when  the infected get their answer kicked every day they'll start kicking in oh so this is like  like once you're once like old age starts to hit everything just comes down like a hammer 
[04:08:00]  yeah once they start once they retire that's when their brain starts turning to jello so  ali and fraser all those guys yeah they were fine when they were boxing once they retired and stopped  doing that that's when all that shit started kicking in their brain is that happening to butterbean  we don't know what happened to butterbean so so pretty boy floyd has uh has some bad news in store for  them huh all of them do all of them do even the bernard hopkins you listen to guys now they can't 
[04:08:30]  find their words they stutter yeah that give about five ten years from now they'll be jello  sugar ray leonard was still in good shape oh because he could he did all the ass kicking he never got  his ass kicked that's probably what it is all right thanks ma'am no problem um i also real quick before  we go i just wanted to add in a little uh matt tidbit this is more for you travis and the rest of the  audience but i'm sure you'll get a kick out of it too um matt told me this morning intern matt who  was again on the show today after i promised you he wouldn't be i'm going to do everything i can to  make sure for you matt rules you're a big fan huge mass reporter actually you know what i hope matt
