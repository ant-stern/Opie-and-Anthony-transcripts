<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with Opie furious at E-Rock for his late arrival (6:05 am) while the show is understaffed due to Anthony’s whooping cough and Jimmy's illness.  Jimmy details his struggles with a new sleep apnea mask, resulting in a sore throat.  The hosts discuss the contagiousness of whooping cough, worrying about Sam's wedding and potential infection of other staff, including Mars, who provides updates on studio cleanliness and staff gossip about Anthony's illness. A brief discussion about racism arises from a comment Mars makes. The conversation continues to center on E-Rock's perceived laziness and unreliability, contrasted with the seriousness of the whooping cough situation.  Opie and Jimmy express their anxieties about contracting the illness themselves.

The show then delves into a lawsuit against John Travolta by a male masseur, reading explicit details from the lawsuit that describe a bizarre encounter involving hamburgers, condoms, chocolate cake wrappers, and alleged inappropriate touching and propositioning.  The hosts debate the plausibility of the claims.  This discussion continues concurrently with the ongoing whooping cough concern, including speculation about Ann potentially having it,  discussion of symptoms, and the effectiveness of Z-Pak antibiotics.  Jim Florentine joins the show in studio. He promotes his stand-up gigs and participates in the Travolta discussion, with a brief mention of a previous incident involving a photograph.  The show concludes with further criticism of E-Rock,  concern about the potential spread of whooping cough amongst the staff (even jokingly considering it a radio bit), and a brief mention of an upcoming Martin Sheen guest appearance.

A segment discussing a family-owned bar with free drinks transitions into a passionate critique of New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, blamed for the failure of a bill to legalize UFC in New York, due to alleged corruption and collusion with unions.  The hosts express outrage, contrasting the situation with the legality of boxing.  Health expert Kenny provides information about pertussis transmission.  This is followed by a humorous, abrasive exchange between the hosts and Kenny regarding a belated birthday card and gift. Kenny's personality is described as detail-oriented and rigid. Jim Florentine, already in the studio, shares a story about his unconventional proposal involving his engagement ring being placed in his baby's diaper.  The conversation covers Jim's upcoming wedding, the UFC ban, criticism of politicians, and includes crude language and discussions of sex and bodily functions.  The Octomom's venture into adult films is briefly mentioned. The segment concludes with continued discussion of Kenny’s personality, routine, and sex life interwoven with comments about Jim Florentine’s upcoming appearances and Ozzy Osbourne playing in the background.

The show features Jimmy promoting his new YouTube show, "The Full Hoon."  He discusses his illness and struggles with a sleep apnea mask.  The hosts tease Kenny about his "Club Soda Kenny" Facebook page, his social media presence, and his promotion of friends' events (like Jim Norton's show). Kenny shares humorous anecdotes.  Jim Florentine is mentioned extensively, discussing his Emmy award for "Inside the NFL," his friendship with Dan Marino, appearances in the show’s specials, his outspokenness (particularly against coupons and club cards), and his interactions with Kenny. Sports talk includes Baron Davis's knee injury and speculation about Jeremy Lin's return to basketball, with a brief discussion of NASCAR. A trivia game with Pro Flowers gift cards as prizes is played, concerning Bryce Harper and Cole Hamels, followed by another winner correctly identifying Alex Gonzalez's injury. The segment ends with a Shari's Berries commercial and a discussion about a bomb threat.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Want to turn that music up? We're broadcasting.  Fucking E-Rock.  Fucking go home. I don't need you.  Obviously the show's under the gun and sick.  We don't know when he's going to be back.  He's got pertussis, which is the whooping cough. 
[00:00:30]  And E-Rock just strolls in at 6.05.  Holy fuck.  I don't need you after 10 o'clock.  Rumor has it you stay here all day. Who gives a fuck?  Getting here before the show starts.  That's when we need you.  Fuck.  What happened, E-Rock?  We'll have some way mixed gear.  I was late, tunnel, traffic.  What was it?  I was stuck on 4.95 at the tunnel. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, how about you leave your house earlier?  God, go home. I don't need you.  I really don't.  Just strolls in, then he's casually talking to an intern.  Oh.  What did you have to talk to the intern about?  He's going to get coffee.  Oh, that's good.  That's the first thing you should be doing at 6.05.  Did he just leave for coffee? 
[00:01:30]  No, he left about 10 minutes ago.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hello.  Jimmy's sick.  I'm sick, and I slept for...  An hour, you said.  I got the apnea masks yesterday.  Yeah.  Where they came to my house, and the woman walked me through what to do.  Right.  So we all knew it wouldn't be easy.  Right.  For fucking, for Pelican Gullet.  Right.  To get the apnea mask.  You definitely need this thing, right?  Horribly, yeah.  Yeah.  God, I don't even... 
[00:02:00]  E-Rock, can you fucking leave for real?  I don't even want to look at you.  Put someone else there for a while.  You're just annoying as fuck.  For real, too, man.  This is not a bit.  Everyone knows Ant's sick, and we're trying to figure this shit out.  We don't know when he's going to be back.  And then you just stroll in at 6.05.  I don't need that shit.  You're not doing me or anyone else a favor by coming in at 6.05 to push a fucking button.  God. 
[00:02:30]  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's okay.  Seriously, I don't want to look at you.  Yeah, I'm in that mood.  You suck.  Who fucking walks in at 6.05 knowing that, you know, the show's going to be a little different  for a while?  Just strolls in like he owns the fucking place.  There's a hundred guys like you I could fucking hire tomorrow.  God.  I'm really annoyed.  I'm really fucking annoyed.  He does basic shit to start, you know, to get the studio set, and he just walks down 
[00:03:00]  the hall at 6.05.  Like, there's no issue whatsoever.  Like, wouldn't you want to get here a little earlier knowing that, you know, the show's  a little different right now?  Of course not.  So, you definitely, I'm so fucking annoyed.  I think we should start over.  This is like a start over.  Breathe.  I was saying that to myself last night.  What?  I'm not suffocating. 
[00:03:30]  I'm not suffocating, man.  There's a mask on your face, but you're not dying.  Just breathe.  Oh, God.  I'm so annoyed.  Anyway.  See, I was telling you this yesterday.  When I get in one of these moods, then it's tough to fucking get out of it.  But I will get out of it, you know.  Anyway, so, you definitely have sleep apnea.  Yeah.  And now we're to the mask stage, right?  Yeah, I've wanted the mask for a long time. 
[00:04:00]  It's just you have to wait for it.  It's a fucking pain in the ass to go through the insurance and stuff.  So, the woman came to my house and bought what they call an APAP machine.  Right.  Which is like a CPAP.  Is that from yesterday?  That's from last night.  I tweeted that last night.  I was wide awake last night.  I was chilling.  I was off Twitter for most of the day yesterday.  No, no, no.  That was really late last night.  Oh, my God.  How do you sleep like that?  And that's the second one.  So, what?  They give you a different mask to try?  Well, I bought the second one.  They're like $110 for the extra mask.  So, I bought... 
[00:04:30]  The first mask I bought was the one...  Well, that comes with it is the one...  It's pretty soft.  Hard Rock Johnny has it.  He was talking to me about it.  Right.  Where it fits over your nose.  You look like a fighter pilot.  Right.  Wraps around your cheeks and around the top of your head.  And has a big tube coming off the top.  Yep.  Connecting to the machine.  It's quiet.  You put some distilled water in as a humidifier.  I laid down at like 12 last night.  And I'm like, I know I'm not going to sleep.  I'm not used to this thing on my face.  My nose is a little stuffy sometimes.  It's going to be a nightmare.  So, I'm laying there and I can't fall asleep with it. 
[00:05:00]  And I know I bought what they call the nose pillows one, which is the next one.  Right.  Which, you look like a cancer patient because it's just two little things up your nostrils.  Feeding air.  Just shooting it into your nose.  But it's not...  It doesn't feel as weird as you think it would.  No?  No.  Well, my nose hair would flutter and tickle the inside of my nose.  It would drive me nuts, I think.  Yeah, you might notice that.  Really?  Yeah.  Maybe shave down the nose hairs.  Yeah, trim it.  Just fucking tunnel that shit out. 
[00:05:30]  But this one wraps around your face once.  And it's not nearly as uncomfortable.  But you got to get used to breathing.  You got to get used to breathing with that.  And I Twittered it.  And I was reading the Twitter.  This is two in the morning now.  I was like, fuck it.  I know it's going to be a bad night, but I got to do it.  Right.  And some guy's like, yeah, dude, it took me ten days to stop feeling claustrophobic.  Like, all right, whatever.  I'll deal with it.  So, I finally...  I was laying on my back.  I was comfortable.  I've never been comfortable.  But then I wake up...  Actually, the bad news was it didn't work so far. 
[00:06:00]  But the good news is I was able to doze off.  And I wake up and I feel like I'm suffocating.  And I feel like someone's stabbing the back of my throat.  It's the air.  Was it drying out everything?  Drying out.  Which I knew was a possibility.  And I have a sore throat now because I have the same thing that either Anne has or something else.  So, I'm like, this is smashing the back of my...  My setting must be wrong.  I don't have it set. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  And the lady forgot to bring a piece.  Like, there's a little SD card that goes in it.  And there's a piece that attaches to the back that will wirelessly send data to the doctor and let him know.  So, what's going to happen is she'll bring that today.  I'll hook it up.  And they'll figure out where my settings are wrong.  But I don't know if I had it set too high.  But the air...  It was almost like when your mouth opens, the seal gets broken and the air will blow out.  It's really weird.  Yeah.  So, I fell back to sleep again.  It happened twice. 
[00:07:00]  Excuse me for silly.  And I finally took the mask off and slept without it.  But it was literally...  So, in the end, you slept better without the masks.  But this is like 3.30 in the morning.  At that point, you're like, fuck this.  I just got to get any sleep I can.  Because it was so...  Because I have a sore throat.  Yeah.  And it hurts so much.  If I didn't have a sore throat, I would have put the mask right back on.  But this was just agonizingly painful.  This dry throat.  I feel like a needle was being stuck in the back of my throat.  Jesus.  So, I don't know what the end game is here. 
[00:07:30]  Well, I mean, the mask itself looks like it's not as cumbersome.  I've seen some of these...  I've seen these masks over the years.  And it looks like they're figuring out the technology a little bit.  But I have to sleep on my fucking belly.  On your stomach?  Yeah.  That's how I sleep with my head to the side.  I can't sleep like that.  So, I would never be able to sleep on my back with a mask like that.  But why...  Is it a breathing issue?  Because I can never sleep on my back.  And I dozed off on my side.  But I was comfortable on my back.  Really?  Yeah.  With the air blasting in like that. 
[00:08:00]  And my nose is not as bad as I thought.  Like, because I'm off the afferent and shit.  So, I'm breathing a little bit better.  I was afraid that my stuffiness would fucking ruin me.  So, how do you cure sleep apnea?  With just a mask or you die?  Yeah.  I mean, it blows the air.  So, you're going to have to wear that for the rest of your life?  They'll figure out a better technology eventually.  Eventually?  But for now, that's how you're going to sleep.  Yeah.  How do you hide that from your dates?  You just shower.  Please.  If my fucking...  If you have a young lady coming over that you don't know well... 
[00:08:30]  Believe me.  She'll see it.  Even married a while, I would never break out a mask.  Yeah.  I would have to do that like just maybe the middle of the night.  You do it immediately.  Really?  You got to break them in immediately.  But I had no one there, so it's fine.  You kind of look like a cancer patient.  I look like a creep.  It doesn't look good.  That mask is harder.  The one that goes over your nose is harder.  They have ones that go all over your mouth, too.  Right.  Some guy Twittered me a picture of himself, and he had it over his nose all the way down  to the part of his jaw. 
[00:09:00]  How the fuck do they figure this out?  Eventually, they'll...  No, I mean, how do they figure it out that this could cure sleep apnea?  These masks with the air shooting in.  I don't get it.  They figure out the...  Excuse me.  I'm very tired.  They can scar your throat, and the scar tissue heals, and that's what kind of...  Right.  But that doesn't work that well, and people always go back to the mask.  I'll figure it out, but I don't know what was wrong that that happened, where I felt  like literally my throat was being stabbed. 
[00:09:30]  Like, did I just wake up and break the seal, and the air was shooting in the back of my throat?  I don't know.  It fucking hurt.  But I'm going to get used to this cocky fuck mask.  I'm going to get used to it.  You slept an hour.  Yeah, but I would have slept better if it wasn't for that pain in my throat.  The agonizing, sharp, shooting pain in my throat.  That might be the start of the cough.  How bad is that?  Did anyone talk to him yesterday?  Mm-mm.  He sent an email.  He was trying to...  What?  He got some medication, at least? 
[00:10:00]  He got the X-Pak.  The Z-Pak.  The Z-Pak.  Which I should probably get today.  I feel like I got it, too.  You feel like you're coughing yet?  No, I went out with some...  After the cell last night, I coughed a couple times.  Small.  Yeah.  But it's a racking, hard, ouch cough.  Really?  Fuck yeah, man.  Are you contagious?  Don't...  I don't know.  I'm so paranoid.  Poor Sam's getting married in a few weeks. 
[00:10:30]  I got a kid at home.  I keep telling Blatter, just keep disinfecting this place.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm not gonna...  Just fog this place, man.  I won't get any closer and don't...  We won't touch, you know?  We usually don't touch, so that's good.  Shut the show down for six weeks.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Just quarantine the entire...  At least until you're married, right, Sam?  Yeah.  Just quarantine the channel.  You feel like this is different?  The sickness?  Yeah.  The cough in me.  Oh, I don't know.  I mean, it has...  I hear this cough is a nightmare.  Everyone's tweeting me.  I'm like, I don't have it, and I'm hoping I don't get it. 
[00:11:00]  Supposedly, it's so bad, you break ribs coughing.  Oh, no.  You can literally break ribs.  Sam, you want to go home?  I don't want to pull an E-Rock.  Yeah, I don't want to be up at the altar coughing.  You won't be.  I hear he stays here to like fucking four, five, six, seven at night sometimes.  There have been times where he's put in.  All that shit doesn't matter.  No, anywhere, I mean...  Why wouldn't he be here an hour before the show if he's the help?  He's the fucking help. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  He walks around like a rock star.  You're the fucking help.  Get here at five, believe it or not.  And then if you have a problem with tunnel traffic or something, guess what?  You're still here at 5.30.  Fuck.  I don't need him from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.  I don't know what the fuck he does.  Not a lot of people do.  What is he, just archiving who gives a fuck shit?  God.  God.  Fucking lazy. 
[00:12:00]  Just strolls down the hall.  Literally no one knows what's going on with Ant.  He's out today.  We have no idea.  So you think everyone would just fucking step up?  Yeah.  You've got to step up.  Holy fuck.  And the only reason I'm losing my shit, because I blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, is we tell this kid over and over again, for years you've got to be here on time.  For years. 
[00:12:30]  But his job really isn't that important, so in a way you don't care, and you brush it off.  But when shit is going down like it is right now, and you need people to step up, that's when you wake up as a fucking human being that has a real cushy job and go, you know what, I think I'm going to try to start getting in there early until everything is figured out.  But no, he strolls in at 6.05, and then starts talking to an intern.  God, he sucks.  He really sucks.  I mean, they made him the intern boss, and so that added to his pre-show responsibilities. 
[00:13:00]  Really?  What is that?  I mean, you know, telling the interns to get coffee and whatnot, but that's...  You know how it takes one second to go, hey, doesn't the intern know he has to get coffee at the exact same time every day?  I mean, there's also the, you could call and text.  All that shit.  Call an intern and tell them.  I do have my job on my fucking phone.  Yeah.  Yeah, he can't text ahead and go, well, obviously I'm late again, so maybe you should go and get coffee and not wait for me to tell you in person. 
[00:13:30]  He's got to get his life together, man.  He's fucking losing it.  He is a little bit.  Huh?  He is a little bit.  You think?  Yeah.  And now we've got the whooping cough.  That's what I'm saying.  Anyone else around here have it?  What's the fucking talk in the hallways?  I don't know if anybody else has it, but Danny has been sneezing a lot, and Ant's thing started as a cold, too. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  So I'm afraid Danny's sneezing a lot, and then it's going to turn to cold symptoms, and then Danny's going to have a whooping cough.  And now it's in my office and in the studio, if Danny's got whooping cough.  Supposedly HR knows about it.  Do they?  Oh, yeah, man.  About his cough?  No, just if it's the whooping cough.  That's what Blatter was telling me.  HR is aware in the fucking cleaning facilities.  Because it's a motherfucker.  I feel bad for him.  I hear it's not good.  It's not good if he really has it. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  It's a nightmare for many weeks.  And it's described as highly contagious.  Highly contagious.  When, though?  Is it one of those things you're contagious before?  Do you show symptoms?  I don't even know, because it lasts just six weeks.  Is Jimmy contagious right now?  Does Jimmy have it?  Do you know, by the way, how glad I am that this didn't happen last week?  Oh.  Yeah, you're lucky.  Shooting, oh.  You're lucky.  You just made it.  Just made it.  You just made it.  That's why I'm here today.  I'm like, I thought of calling out.  I mean, I never take sick days, but I wind up using them to travel for that. 
[00:15:00]  I mean, so it balances.  Right, right.  They take care of me, but I was like, nah, man, you know, I just fucking missed a week.  Apparently, it's contagious for the first three weeks of symptoms.  Oh, my God.  I'll go get a Z-Pak today, but I have to get a doctor's appointment.  I don't know what I should take, but I'll take what I should.  Can I have one of those Chinese masks, please?  Yeah, we should broadcast in SARS masks.  Could you go get some?  Yep. 
[00:15:30]  I'm going to go find them.  I'm not even joking.  I know you're paranoid.  I'm getting one.  You're paranoid, right?  Yeah, I'm going to get a pack of them.  We should broadcast with SARS masks on.  I'll do it.  Okay.  I'll send E-Roc down and get him.  What is he doing now?  Moping?  He doesn't even mope.  None of this affects him.  We've sat him down.  Every fucking person around here has sat him down.  You have to at least be here before the show starts.  Is that asking too much?  Fuck.  I need people that want to be here. 
[00:16:00]  That means show up at 5, not stay until 7 at night.  What the fuck do you do here at 7 at night?  Here, get some SARS masks.  Okay.  I've got to work my way out of this mood.  Oh, fucking Mars has them.  Mars has masks?  Yeah.  Mars, what do you know about this?  What's the talk on the street?  The studio is nice and clean.  I'll tell you that much.  Yeah?  I took care of the studio.  I ain't wearing this.  I'll look like an idiot.  I'll wear it.  You're getting married.  You wear it.  It's all Lysol'd up.  We're good to go, man. 
[00:16:30]  Trust me.  Lysol takes care of the whooping cough.  Yeah, it's quite hard to talk to that anyway.  I'm just worried about my kid.  That's it.  That's why I'm a little fucking agitated.  I don't want him getting fucking sick.  Does it sound different?  A little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Are people talking in the hallways about this, Mars?  You're always good with the gossip.  Fuck it.  You and your fellow engineers.  Well, they were talking shit about when we found out. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  You guys look like a little gang, but in the end, you're like little old ladies fucking gossiping.  We're worse than old ladies.  Oh, my God.  But we were concerned about finding out.  You know I love you.  I love you and your whole crew.  You know that in the end.  I don't know about that crew.  I like your crew.  Most of them, yeah.  There's one guy who says hi to me all the time.  I still don't know his name.  He kind of looks like you.  Like me?  Yeah.  He looks like he could be your cousin.  No one's looking like me in that shop.  Oh, see.  I just see color, so I'm sorry. 
[00:17:30]  Oh, wow.  Brown equals brown.  It always goes back to the race.  What?  I'm not racist.  Yeah, right?  I'm not racist.  I know you're not.  Well, I am a little.  Okay.  Because I think everyone is.  We all are.  But I'm not a lot racist.  Just a little.  I'm within the levels you're supposed to be, as far as racism goes.  Yeah, absolutely.  But everyone's racist.  We all profile.  You should.  So what were you saying?  What's the word on the street?  There was concern because you guys, Anthony told us about it on Sunday night at 8. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  What do you know before then?  He didn't know, I don't think.  Yeah, well, in all fairness, I don't know.  He just thought he had a regular cold slash cough.  I guess he found that.  And then he realized, he did tell me a few times last week, he goes, this is a motherfucker.  And I just thought he had a really bad, you know, cold.  And then I guess he has it.  Every time I come in here, I get a sore throat.  The same thing happened yesterday.  And then I woke up and I didn't have a sore throat anymore.  And now I have a sore throat again.  Because you're paranoid. 
[00:18:30]  I know.  But you should be paranoid.  I remember leading up to my wedding.  I didn't want nothing to go wrong.  I was worried about colds, fucking swamp lip, all sorts of shit.  And now I got to worry about pertussis.  If you have whooping cough, you know how hard I'm going to laugh at you?  That's how you're going to sound.  Because that's air going back into your lungs.  I know everything about this fucking thing.  Does he officially have it?  Did he go to a doctor?  Does he have a doctor's note?  Like, does he have it?  Or is he assuming he has it? 
[00:19:00]  It would be nice to know if he doesn't have it.  If he got a Z-Pak, he must be really bad.  Yeah, of course.  I want a Z-Pak.  I fucking eat Z-Paks for breakfast sometimes.  They're like vitamins sometimes.  Yeah, I'll take one more.  You feel a little something coming on, you just assume, ah, the Z-Pak will take care of it.  Some things it doesn't work with, though.  When you have certain things, sore throats and shit, like viral things, it does nothing.  And supposedly you're not supposed to take a lot of those.  Because, you know, then you build up your immune system.  And then, you know, then you're fucked.  But I still take them, like, vitamins from time to time. 
[00:19:30]  I'm going to go to the doctor today.  I'm going to have to work.  You look horrible.  That's also the sleep, though.  Yeah.  But you've been looking good.  You lost weight and all that, but you look horrible right now.  Yeah, I feel awful.  Because you're dealing with the sleep apnea mask.  And possibly what Ann has.  I don't know what I should do if I should put the mask on again tonight.  That air hurt my throat.  Why don't you try it for a nap?  But don't they have saline, you said? 
[00:20:00]  I know.  I use distilled water.  To keep the air, like, moist?  Yeah, it's a humidifier.  Nothing worse than breathing in dry air.  Yeah, no, I'm breathing in okay air.  What you do in New York City.  I need humidifiers in every fucking room.  People are still fucking using their heat in New York.  And I live up high, so all the heat rises.  And we bake.  I didn't turn on my heat once this whole winter.  How fucked up is that?  We had a pretty decent winter.  Not a lot of snow, but, you know, the temperatures are dropping down.  I never had to turn it on once. 
[00:20:30]  My AC doesn't work in the winter.  I would use my air conditioning in the winter.  Oh, mine, we turn it on pretty much all year long.  Because it's that fucking hot.  And open the windows in the middle of winter.  Yeah, my window's all open.  That is weird.  All right.  This isn't just an I do situation, either.  I have vows to read.  You're so worried.  Yeah, well, I'm going to be coughing.  You want to go home?  I have to go home for like six weeks. 
[00:21:00]  Whoever wants to go home could go home.  Whatever.  Can I come back like mid-June?  You can come back, yeah, after your marriage, I guess.  Okay.  I wouldn't blame you.  Just take a month off?  Did you read what this fucking thing does?  It sounds horrible.  Take a fucking club drop.  Say I do.  Shut up.  I got multiple.  Take a Ludens.  A Ludens.  Take a Ludens.  And drink some orange juice.  Have some fucking.  Have some OJ.  Take a Ludens. 
[00:21:30]  Go on your honeymoon.  Shut up.  But you can barely see that.  Exactly.  Shut up.  Supposedly, you cough so much that your lungs literally run out of air.  You always have a little air in your lungs.  But this cough takes the last bit of fucking air out of your lungs.  That air that's probably been sitting there for who knows how long because it just never, you know, it just stays there.  And that's why you whoop because now all the air is rushing back into your lungs. 
[00:22:00]  You're basically gasping for air so you can continue with your life.  So I'm going to be gasping for air as I'm trying to explain to Jess why I appreciate her?  Yeah.  That's how you're going to say appreciate her?  Well, I'm not going to use those words.  Well, why would you use it here?  That's the sentiment.  Why would you use it here?  Well, I don't have my vows written yet.  Appreciate is a horrible word to compliment someone with.  No, that's all right.  No, it's not really good.  You're not really committing anything.  Unromantic zilch.  I appreciate you.  There'll be messages of love as well. 
[00:22:30]  That's better.  Yeah.  Are you sure?  Tell you like the moon and stars and shit.  Do you have that emotion in you, love?  I have lots of emotions in me.  You do?  Yeah.  Do you have lots of love for Jess?  Lots.  Yeah, they're all right.  They're good together.  She makes my life better.  Can we get videos of...  Sort of wrestling figures.  Yeah, I love wrestling figures too.  Good point.  Can we get some Pertussis video clips, please?  I don't know.  You got to hear what this sounds like.  I wonder if Ann sounds like that. 
[00:23:00]  Everyone is suggesting masks for you, but I'm sure you're all in on that, right?  Yeah.  The one I had, the pillow one, little pillow nose thing.  I just want to know why did I wake up gasping for breath, feeling like my throat was being  stabbed with a needle.  Was that literally because I need to set my mask higher?  Or lower?  Maybe there's too much air coming in.  Oh, maybe.  This is whooping cough week five, day two. 
[00:23:30]  Is this a good video?  I just found it.  I don't know.  You don't know?  A bit of a daily update just for myself so I can sort of see how I'm doing over the next  few days and monitor if I am really improving the leaps and bounds or not.  I think it's one of the side effects of Prenticelline, too.  You tend to feel a lot better than you really are.  And then you go and do something, which I kind of discovered a bit last night.  Oh, my gosh. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, no.  What?  You're still not getting married.  I can't be here.  Put that mask on.  Yeah, the bursitis in my shoulder is obviously flared up from all the coughing.  So I'm sitting here with an ice pack on every 20 minutes.  But I ended up at Pootscrayer Hospital waiting five hours to get someone to... 
[00:24:30]  What's wrong with her shoulder from coughing?  What's wrong with her shoulder?  If I had some old dildo injury.  Very helpful, especially sitting in a waiting room.  I know they were busy, but there were other people who actually got in before me who were nowhere near sick.  I don't care what they say.  I'd actually spoken to those people, and they were saying that I should go before them.  They heard me coughing.  And the nurse was incredibly unhelpful, even when I told them that, you know, I've got whooping cough. 
[00:25:00]  Whooping?  Whooping cough.  Sitting in a waiting room with a bunch of sick people is not probably the best thing for me right now.  So I don't mind waiting, but five hours is just a little bit too much.  Anyway, that's my bitch about Pootscrayer.  To fix their triage system.  Even someone who worked there was in the emergency room.  Sam, she sounds good.  You're all right.  She's still sitting there.  She's having trouble catching her breath.  So obviously, I don't feel so crash hot.  I think Jimmy should breathe on you now. 
[00:25:30]  No.  So you can get it.  And then four weeks from now, you'll be pretty good.  No, she's like her.  Week five.  She's not out of breath.  She's trying to avoid talking and saying certain things that make her cough.  Six weeks.  It takes that long to get in with one.  And they're probably going to tell me they can't do anything for me apart from managing  the pain either.  They just sound English too, which is weird.  So I've just inflamed it.  And that's all there is to it.  So it's just the coughing.  My throat's still really sore.  I still, as you can see, it still look like a gopher. 
[00:26:00]  And when I cough, I look like a bullfrog.  Just really.  Find a better one.  She coughed once.  Look at this fucking bitch.  Well, at least fast forward a little.  I'll see if she just wants one more coughing fit.  Yeah, we will.  I want real fucking coughing fit videos.  That is a serious matter. 
[00:26:30]  Dude.  I think my voice might sound a little bit different, but if you have the whooping cough,  I really feel sorry for you.  It sucks.  It's the worst.  It's worse than a cold to me.  I'd rather have a cold than have the whooping cough.  Wow, that's very harsh.  They have the whooping cough.  That's the whooping cough.  It's worse than even a cold.  Could you find worse videos?  You're really failing here, Sam. 
[00:27:00]  Terribly.  These videos that have a lot of red on YouTube means they're boring.  If you don't like them.  Empathizing.  They're not giving it red because they don't want to get the whooping cough.  Nobody wants to see a fat lady empathize.  If you get a video with all green, that means someone is really whooping it up.  And those are the ones we want.  But I'll bet you it is because people are not immunizing their kids.  That's a big part of it.  That's why kids are probably getting this stuff and bringing it to adults.  Oh my gosh. 
[00:27:30]  This is bad.  I don't need to see kids doing it.  That's who gets whooping cough usually.  Why are adults getting it?  Have we been immunized already?  For that?  We're so fucking old.  I don't know if they were giving us shots for that shit. 
[00:28:00]  I believe my kid got a shot for that.  I'm not coughing yet.  He might probably do it.  If kids are getting all those...  My kid got all those shots and he's almost two.  So he must have got this one, right?  I would think so, yeah.  All right, good.  All right.  This is not good.  I wonder...  Let me say hi to Dave on Long Island.  Dave!  Hey.  What's up, Dave?  Yeah, I had a whooping cough spread throughout Long Island this winter.  So it's just some lady didn't get her kids immunized.  And then I got that. 
[00:28:30]  And I was driving.  And I had to cough so hard just to get air in my system.  The auto almost felt like I was passing out.  I should have pulled over and probably stopped.  But it happened a couple of times.  And I was like, oh, shit, I'm a wreck.  You passed out from coughing so much?  Yeah.  I already had a blackout almost for you.  Look at those blackouts where you're like, what the fuck did I just do?  Oh, that's wonderful.  Sam, you're going to be all right, though.  When do you get Z-Packs?  It's highly contagious and, you know, two of the guys that are in here with you every day have it.  Well, we don't know if Jimmy has it. 
[00:29:00]  I've got to get a Z-Pack.  You want a Z-Pack?  Yeah.  I've got some Z-Packs.  You do?  Oh, yeah, I've got some Z-Packs.  I need it.  So, take the news next.  It dries you out even worse.  Okay.  I don't think you want a dry fucking system if you're coughing a lot.  That's even worse.  My teeth.  Oh, I can't do that.  It hurts.  Oh, no.  My teeth are dry.  Oh, that really hurts my throat badly.  Really?  Yeah.  Edgar's not as easy and fluid as everybody thinks.  There's a lot of work into Edgar.  You get to move your bottom teeth forward. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  My throat is sore.  My teeth are dry.  Good.  Maybe I'll come in late tomorrow, and then you'll send me home.  I won't have to worry about it.  Yeah, but I wouldn't care if you came in late, because you're not late usually.  That's the difference.  If you're late every day.  We're annoyed when you saw him walking.  Of course.  I'm annoyed every day when he does it, because it's like, you know, this whole job is like,  how about you make sure everything's set up nice for the show?  I don't give a fuck what you do after 10 o'clock.  Yeah.  That's nonsense work. 
[00:30:00]  What is he, hang around the water cooler chit-chatting and gossiping?  Just getting to know his fellow employees.  I don't know what he does.  How was Chaz on the after show?  He was good.  I saw him in the bathroom in his chat.  You notice how I just walked right by him?  I did.  That was awkward.  But he did remember going to your wedding.  He did?  Very much.  He didn't talk to him?  No, I didn't feel like it.  He's nice.  He walked in, and I just kind of said, hey, and he was kind of in my way between me and 
[00:30:30]  the door, and I got past him, and I left.  Yeah, it was a really weird.  A few people pointed that out to me on Twitter.  It was a really, really weird interaction.  With who?  Chaz.  And me?  Oh, yeah.  Why was it weird?  I was leaving, and he was coming.  Because he had no idea what was going on.  We were still on the air, and I had to move out from here and walk over to your spot,  but we didn't go to break at all.  I didn't even know he was in the building yesterday.  I went to 10, 10, 15.  I was good for the day.  Yeah, but when Chaz walked in, you could have just been like, oh.  And then some asshole's like, oh, that's why you guys don't get good guests for your show. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, we do get good guests for your show.  Thank you, Sam.  I mean, that's...  I didn't even want to tweet that.  I'm like, really?  If that's what you think, then enjoy your stupid loser life.  Yeah.  We get a lot of really good guests now, thanks to Roland.  What are you talking about?  Pretty consistently.  Too many guests at this point.  We're saying no.  Yeah.  Did you find a whooping cough video to save this?  Not really.  It's all kids.  Yeah.  The kid thing is...  Can't talk with Paul either. 
[00:31:30]  Huh?  Yay.  You can't do any of them.  Shoot up, Sam.  Hopefully you can't do shit.  Edgar hurts.  Edgar hurts.  Yeah.  Because you're going to push at your throat.  Yeah.  This is easy breezy Japanese.  I could do this all day.  Oh, grace.  Easy peasy.  Okay.  Hey, what are you, Quincy over there with your mask or something?  No.  They're going to say, hey, do you take this woman?  You're going to go, cough, cough.  Uh, too much air.  Too much airflow into the mask.  A lot of people saying, Jimmy, too much airflow into the mask. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, really?  Probably hitting the back of that throat, drying it up, making it scratchy and needly.  Too much.  Probably too much.  That's what I'm thinking.  That's what they're thinking.  I turned it down.  You can adjust this.  And I was on, maybe I should go even lower.  Yeah.  You're going to have to talk to your people.  I can't believe I fell asleep with it, though.  It's weird.  Does it make a noise?  No.  When you have it, you hear a teeny, you feel a bit of air coming out the front.  Not leakage. 
[00:32:30]  Right.  A little seepage.  But they, she showed me that there's going to be air that comes out the front of it.  She was very nice.  This lady, Wendy, came and helped me.  Right.  There's a 24-hour hotline.  I'll just call that when I get home.  How many people have this sleep apnea?  A lot?  A lot.  A lot.  I actually fell, and I never fall back to sleep.  I was so tired when I get up this morning.  I was sitting on my bed, and I just fucking, with the lights on, just laid on my comforter.  And that does off.  I never do that.  Right.  Fuck, once I'm up, I'm like, I don't go back into the bed. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Fucking mess this week.  I'm a mess.  Fuck, the show is falling apart.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's going to be falling apart.  But Anz, I mean, Anz obviously got some, either he's a whooping cough or just a severe  cough.  Right.  But he's got something bad.  I can feel it.  I hope it's not a whooping cough.  Huh?  It might have been a whooping cough.  What's that?  I hope it's not a whooping cough.  We all hope that.  We're kind of secretly hoping.  I hope I don't have a whooping cough.  Yeah, I mean, I don't care about Anz.  I love Anz.  I don't care if Anz has it. 
[00:33:30]  I don't want it.  Right.  I hope I didn't catch it or something.  That's all.  I've been to so many weddings in my life that this would be a highlight if the whole thing  is done through whooping cough.  That would be great.  That would be amazing.  If your dad has it, you have it, Jess has it.  You can't cancel the shit because you put out too much money.  The whole place is whooping it up.  The wedding is going to be wonderful and memorable without whooping cough.  It's not going to be memorable.  It will be.  Let me think.  I'm going to have checked.  I can't name one wedding that was memorable.  What about yours?  Mine was memorable.  Yours and Noam's are the two best. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah?  Really?  That's what?  I gave yours the edge.  Over who?  Noam.  Noam's ceremony was more fun because yours was a more traditional ceremony, but your reception,  I think, was...  What about the gospel people?  They were great.  That's not traditional.  No, but it felt like a nice wedding.  We had to get that in a Catholic church.  That's not easy.  Yeah.  But you notice, they said absolutely no.  We wanted gospel singers up in the balcony, and they said, fuck no, this is a Catholic  church.  And they said it that way, too. 
[00:34:30]  Noam's at Tom Papa and Modi doing a ceremony.  It was really bizarre.  And then we greased some people.  Next thing you know, we got gospel singers in the fucking Catholic church.  How much did it cost to get gospel singers?  What is greasing the church?  How much does that cost you to get that done?  I don't remember.  A thousand bucks?  Probably.  Probably somewhere around there.  Isn't it odd you could just tip to the church and get the fucking...  Yeah.  They're like, absolutely not.  There's a Catholic church.  You know, we want to keep it all nice.  And we're like, well, we really want the gospel singers. 
[00:35:00]  We want to do something a little different.  Nope.  They were fucking singing when the saints come marching in a Catholic church.  We got that done.  Dude, everyone has a price in the end.  Everyone has a fucking price, except for John Travolta's masseuse, obviously.  A masseur.  Yeah, it is a masseur.  Young man.  Young man?  It's a very shady situation.  Well, Travolta's saying no.  Yes.  I guess a masseur is suing John Travolta for $2 million. 
[00:35:30]  But John Travolta's people saying we could prove he was on the East Coast when this whole  complaint went down.  Ah, okay.  That's what they're saying in the paper today.  But who the fuck knows?  We should take a break so we can read the entire complaint.  I personally believe the masseur, from what I've just heard.  But however, I still think he's a scumbag.  And I still think that, you know, come on, man.  $2 million?  You know what?  Fuck out of here.  This will keep the people today.  I'm just going through the complaint, right?  It's like four or five pages. 
[00:36:00]  We're going to read a lot of it.  I swear I just was leafing through and I stopped and I said, all right, what is this about?  This is what I see.  Fully erect and was roughly eight inches in length and his pubic hair was wiry and unkept.  Oh, my God.  We're reading this whole fucking thing.  Fucking John Travolta's packing eight.  Fucking respect that.  By the way, why do we start on page three here?  Is that just where the good stuff starts?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  No, Travis went through the whole thing.  The stuff before that is just, you know, like, this guy, this guy. 
[00:36:30]  They met on Craigslist?  Where did he get to go?  Yeah, he called and this guy's a professional masseur and so...  But Travolta met him in his truck and drove him to his bungalow.  No, Travolta didn't.  Some other guy did.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to get into the whole...  Trust me.  I gave you the good stuff.  Yeah, we're going to get into the whole thing right after the break.  See, Travis was here early.  He knew the complaint was a lot of pages and guess what?  He went through the whole fucking thing before the show.  But I texted Kenny and told him I was going to be...  I'm not mad at you.  No, I know.  I'm teasing.  Holy fuck, no. 
[00:37:00]  No, I'm kidding.  You do your job.  I'm not mad at Jimmy.  You weren't even late.  No, I came in by 10 after 6.  I don't feel bad.  I was...  Oh, my God.  I'm not talking about you, Jimmy.  No, I do.  I know I'm God.  Okay.  All right.  He's talking about E-Rock.  5 after 6 is late.  It's pretty late.  That's bad.  Yeah.  That's like me walking in at 7.30.  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, at times we're all late. 
[00:37:30]  At times we all do a last minute sickness.  That's all just part of fucking working in general.  But this kid for years would say at least get here before the fucking show starts.  And he still doesn't.  But today it was kind of important, obviously.  I'll cover your bases while you're sitting in traffic.  Just start throwing out texts.  Whatever.  He's lost.  Hopefully he figures it out.  I do like the guy, but he's fucking lost.  All right.  We're going to break and we're going to fucking talk about John Travolta next. 
[00:38:00]  Stay there.  It's E-Rock Radio.  I love E-Rock.  We love E-Rock Radio.  E-Rock?  What's that?  E-Rock Radio.  Yeah, I like them.  It's hot.  It's cool.  E-Rock.  E-Rock?  E-Rock Radio.  He's evil.  He's a bad guy.  He's not true to himself.  He's just ugly and his nose is falling off.  I don't love it.  He's an asshole.  Eric Nagel is this bisexual incompetent radio guy, believe it or not.  I don't like listening to him.  I mean, he's not really that smart.  I'm sure I can go fuck himself. 
[00:38:30]  Serious, Serious X-Hands.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Under weird circumstances.  Ant's out.  Don't know when he's going to be back.  Supposedly he has pertussis.  I think that's true now.  A lot of people weren't sure if he was joking when he sent the email a couple days ago.  Jimmy thought he was joking, but now it seems like he's not joking. 
[00:39:00]  Jimmy's in the bathroom.  He doesn't feel good.  He's starting to cough.  He's also not sleeping, though.  Yeah, he's got the sleep apnea thing as well on top of it.  But no, he doesn't look good.  I know.  I'm really banking on Jim not having whooping cough or tussis.  And you're getting married in, what, four and a half weeks?  Basically.  So you've got to get the whooping cough now.  You have to.  It lasts six weeks anyway.  Go sit where Anthony's sitting, or used to sit.  Just breathe it all in. 
[00:39:30]  Breathe it all in.  Let Jimmy touch you.  Let Jimmy cough in your face.  Because four weeks later, then that's good.  No, it lasts six weeks.  All right.  You might be a little fucking weak and maybe have some slight coughing at your wedding.  That's okay, though, instead of it being full-blown.  I don't know.  Let's get it now.  Let's do that.  I don't want to get it at all.  I need a Z-Pack.  I don't even know what a Z-Pack is.  Did you tell Jess?  Not yet.  Well, I told Jess that Ant had whooping cough.  Yeah.  But I didn't tell her that I was very worried about whooping cough just running rampant in this studio. 
[00:40:00]  I don't know.  I've been sneezing a little bit.  It makes you totally paranoid, right?  Of course.  But I also have allergies this time of year, so I'm hoping that's all it is.  I think that's all it is.  I was sneezing last night, but I also figure, well, I also, I need to eat.  I need to sleep.  I think I credited myself for just being run down.  Right.  You know how when you're run down, you get cold symptoms sometimes.  And this is, you know, me and Ant don't hang out, so I could be good. 
[00:40:30]  That's true.  It's finally paid off that you're not friends.  I think we're friends.  Well.  We're friendly.  You're friends?  Remember Bob Kelly was in here yesterday?  Right.  Like, you're not, like, friends, but you're...  We're friendly.  You're not enemies.  No, we're not enemies, and we're friendly.  You tell me what you're right?  You tell me what you're right?  I'm me and Ant.  I go, this is the upside of not hanging out with Anthony.  I might have skated this thing.  Right.  The old days, oh boy, I would have fucking had the whooping cough.  Yeah, because you were sharing, you were driving around together and hanging out and... 
[00:41:00]  That would be the ultimate radio bit, though.  All of us with the whooping cough trying to do a radio show one day?  Uh-huh.  Let's fucking promise each other if that happens, Jimmy.  If we all have the whooping cough, we, you know, we've got to shut down the show for about six weeks,  but one day we all come in and attempt to do a radio show with the whooping cough.  That's something that has never been tried before in broadcasting history.  I want to be the first.  I'll certainly come in and do it. 
[00:41:30]  With the whooping cough?  Of course.  Yeah.  I would, too.  I don't like missing radio, man.  Even if you completely lose your voice.  You don't like missing radio.  I hate it.  Like, I mean, again, if I'm away and I'm working, but I hate sick days, I don't even  want to take them.  I mean, I will if I have to, but I fucking hate it.  And it's not going to be a goody gumdrops.  I'm just like, fuck, I'm going to miss something.  Yeah, I hate missing it, too.  I fucking hate it.  Yeah.  So, you know, I bumped into that Martin Sheen's in the building today and we couldn't get  him and Emilio because they're coming in at 1230.  Oh, that's why?  I think so.  Is Ronnie going to get him?  Yeah.  Yes. 
[00:42:00]  But I really do think it was a scheduling issue.  Like, we have Martin, apparently, for Spider-Man.  But are they just doing TV in the morning?  Yeah, they're not even available until 1230 when they come in.  So we're not?  Okay.  But we are going to have Martin Sheen down the road?  That's what Roland's told me, yeah, for Spider-Man.  Wow, that's pretty cool.  I think, when is that?  June or July?  Yeah.  Why wasn't Spider-Man in the Avengers movie and just get, you know...  Because Spider-Man's not an Avenger.  Yeah, he's not.  Ah, but how about you just throw him in there?  I don't think the comic book fans should be happy.  Plus, just throw the Spider-Man in there. 
[00:42:30]  Let's get that done next time for the next Avengers movie.  So you don't have to have all these separate movies that you have to fucking watch.  But, I mean, all the Avengers also had separate movies.  I know he's not here to defend himself, but I put on The Incredibles last night.  And me and my son, he fucking...  That movie freaked him the fuck out because it was a lot of action.  So he was grabbing on to me tight.  Oh, it's like his first action movie.  And forcing me to take...  He took my hand and made sure I had it wrapped around him tight. 
[00:43:00]  Was it very cute when he was doing that?  Adorable.  I fucking loved it.  But when I would let go, as soon as the action happened again, he would pull it tight.  And I'm like, you want me to turn this off?  Because he understands everything now.  He's like, no.  But he was like fucking...  His eyes were wide open.  Like, what the fuck is this?  You forget.  I took him to the zoo once.  Just assuming, like, it's a zoo.  You know what a zoo is.  It was the first time he went to a zoo.  I think I might have said something.  I apologize.  But it would be like us going to another planet and seeing aliens.  Wouldn't you be completely freaked out? 
[00:43:30]  Like, the first time he saw a giraffe?  I've been in the zoo a million times.  So I'm like, oh, the zoo.  Let's take him to the zoo.  But to him, it's like, what the fuck is this?  It's true.  You forget.  Because they look like dinosaurs.  Right.  Right.  Look at this thing with the giant neck.  Right.  Just imagine.  Like a hippo walking around or a rhinoceros?  Well, if he was ever here, he probably would have seen that already.  Penguins?  Depending on what time he got here.  Yeah.  Penguins with their little, like, can't fly wings.  Oh, my God.  And just a polar bear jumps in the water?  A big white bear jumping in the water? 
[00:44:00]  But to me, I'm like, it's a zoo.  You forget that, you know, we've all had these life experiences over and over again.  But that's the one thing I'm learning is, you know, there's what the fuck is this moments  with your kid?  Because they're doing all this stuff for the first time.  So it's the first kind of action movie.  I think Sam's right.  Yeah.  But I was watching The Incredibles, and I have two observations about it.  The main character is the spitting image of Jay Moore.  The old superhero is Jay Moore.  And then the guy that is the incredible guy's number one fan is E-Rock. 
[00:44:30]  It's fucking E-Rock.  You've got to get him without the mask.  The one that turns into the arch nemesis?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's E-Rock.  That's Jay Moore.  Look.  It actually does look like Jay Moore.  Yeah, Jesus.  That's Jay Moore.  It's exactly Jay Moore.  I wanted to tweet him yesterday.  I'll probably take that picture and tweet him and say, Jay, this is you.  And then the arch nemesis, right.  That's fucking E-Rock.  Is this the first time you've said that? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, I think so.  You know who said the exact same thing about the character in E-Rock?  On this one?  Yeah.  No, I did the WALL-E one.  Roland has said this.  About The Incredibles?  That E-Rock is the villain from The Incredibles.  Really?  Yeah.  I said it too.  No, you didn't, Chip.  Really?  Yeah.  Do you got a picture of him?  Do you remember?  What was his name?  Do you remember?  It was like, fuck yeah.  It wasn't Edgar, I'm sure.  Yeah, it was Edgar.  Edgar Man or something.  Roger Davis?  That's him when he becomes the arch nemesis. 
[00:45:30]  You got to get him as the young boy, like the little fan boy.  Because he has blonde hair and everything.  When E-Rock fucking dyed his hair, especially, he looked just like this kid in this movie.  So he looks just like the Florida boy that you met on the road somewhere?  Yeah.  Eager, sweet boy.  Yeah, I just wanted to please.  We just wanted to eat hamburgers and get a massage.  Look at little E-Rock.  Look at E-Rock.  He put on his Opie mask and wanted him to be just like his hero Opie.  And just like, E-Rock is the same guy. 
[00:46:00]  He's trying to be like, this guy is an Incredibles fan, so he wants to be a superhero.  Right.  And E-Rock is turning into an Opie fan, so he's going to be an evil radio show guy.  I'm sure he'll turn out to be my arch nemesis.  Half these fucking assholes become that.  He probably will.  Fucking losers.  That had no business being here in the first place.  John Travolta.  Did a lot of favors in my career, and then they fucking bite me in the ass.  And then do nothing with their careers after they leave here.  Fucking losers. 
[00:46:30]  Do you think they blame you because they did nothing?  Yeah, of course they do.  Of course they all do.  Fucking losers.  John Travolta, Jim Norton.  We got a situation.  Does the Hollywood Reporter have to put their big, I guess, could they put it as small?  Well, that's why they did it, because we just said it now.  See?  See, it worked.  But you're right.  The first paragraph might be tough to read, because it says the Hollywood Reporter in big letters.  Every page does it.  Across the report.  But John Travolta being sued for $2 million, right? 
[00:47:00]  From a masseur.  Does supposedly John Travolta want to jerk off the masseur?  That's what the guy is saying, but there's a lot of detail in here.  Like, I guess, I don't know how he got...  Travis, this starts on page three with the good stuff.  How did the guy actually get to the bungalow?  There's a bungalow where the Beverly Hills Hilton or the Beverly Hills Hotel?  Hang on, I'll tell you in one second.  Yeah, it was the Beverly Hills Hotel and one of the bungalows.  And Travis was saying, after reading that thing, he 100% believes that this guy is a lunatic who's made the whole thing up. 
[00:47:30]  There's no possible way.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, look.  John Travolta would not tell some guy, I got to where I am by doing sexual favors on men during Welcome Back, Cotter.  He just wouldn't tell a stranger that.  I don't believe that either.  I think that's bullshit.  But I do believe that something happened with him and the masseur at one point.  Maybe it's all true.  And John Travolta's like...  He just got all horned up and said too much.  Right.  He just couldn't control himself. 
[00:48:00]  All right, let me try to read over the Hollywood Reporter here.  It says, plaintiff is informed and believes...  Roland, what's up?  He just handed me something.  You good, Roland?  You got the whooping cough?  No.  Allergies kicked in last night.  Oh, I hope it's allergies.  You sure it's allergies?  Yeah, because I didn't...  I was in the...  I didn't have a temperature or...  Another guy with a shitty voice.  Yeah, I know.  What's going on around here?  Did you hear what Opie said about the villain from The Incredibles? 
[00:48:30]  Incrediboy?  Yeah.  What?  He said it's E-Rock just like you said it was E-Rock.  I never said that.  He's lying.  Why are you cringing?  What?  My allergies.  He's cringing because he doesn't want E-Rock to know that he called him Incrediboy when he wasn't listening.  And are you sure it's allergies?  Yeah, because if I had the flu, I'd be coughing and have a...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We're not talking about the flu here.  Oh.  It starts with a little, like, cold symptoms and then one, maybe a couple days from now, all of a sudden you have just a cough. 
[00:49:00]  Also, you just go, and then that cough gets worse and worse and worse.  Is this like an outbreak where we have to be...  Yeah.  ...cleaning us like monkey?  If it has pertussis, it's...  They write on every website, highly contagious.  It's a highly contagious bacterial disease.  Not contagious.  Highly contagious.  You could get it from just being in the same room as the person.  You don't have to touch the person.  He doesn't have to cough on you.  Nothing.  I've been good drinking.  You're just breathing in the same air as the person. 
[00:49:30]  We were around Anthony closely in Cleveland.  Yes, we...  Well, yeah.  Yeah, we spent time together in the van.  I was in the van with him.  You weren't in the van.  Fuck, I sat next to him on the plane.  Oh, everybody has it?  And that's probably where it started.  The plane.  God damn it.  Oh, that fucking...  God damn Anthony and his fucking sitting next to me on the plane laughing and cavorting.  You're fucked.  God damn that laughing...  Or his bed drops into your drink.  Cavorting travel companion. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, we were sitting next to you.  I forgot.  So, Jimmy might be a couple days behind it, and now you've got a little something happening wrong.  I'll drink whiskey tonight and get drunk.  I'll be fine.  I don't do that.  Do you think the whiskey will kill the whooping cough?  Oh, yeah.  They kill anything.  Emergency is good.  I just said that to make you feel better.  It's all I've been drinking.  It's actually helpful.  Whiskey's more fun, though.  By the way, the beginning of this, this first part of this is good, too.  The first...  Where do you want me to start?  It's leading into how the guy...  All the way from the top?  Yeah, because it's leading into the guy going into the bungalow. 
[00:50:30]  And just so you know...  Jim, you were right.  John Travolta did pick him up by himself.  John Travolta picked the guy up.  Yep.  So how...  Wait.  John Travolta was going to be at the Beverly Hills Hotel in a bungalow.  This is according to the guy.  We have no fucking idea.  Travolta's people are already saying that they can prove that Travolta wasn't even on the  West Coast when this all went down.  All right.  So we've got to make sure we state that.  Sure.  Okay.  But who the fuck knows in the end?  So John Travolta knows he's going to be at the bungalow.  He hires a masseur to fucking give him a rubdown. 
[00:51:00]  And he goes and picks up the masseur for $200 an hour or something?  $200 an hour, which I guess is standard for masseurs for a masseur.  But wait, hold on.  Travis, why was he picking him up?  That's a weird thing to do.  And the bungalow, I guess, is very, very private.  So you probably don't want hotel people to see it.  The unidentified male called plaintiff's cell phone from a blocked number claiming to represent  a celebrity client.  Plaintiff had only discussed the price would be $200 an hour.  The unidentified male told plaintiff to go to a specific street.  Defendant himself picked plaintiff up in a black Lexus SUV. 
[00:51:30]  Defendant was wearing dark glasses, blah, blah, blah.  There were Trojan condoms in the console of the vehicle.  And there also appeared to be two or three wrappers from chocolate cake packages on the  floor of the SUV.  Fats, I just wanted some cake and dick.  I hope he did make the whole thing up.  And this psychopath is just accusing John Travolta of eating chocolate cakes.  Wait, were the condoms just laying about?  In the console, he said.  Yeah, in the console, yeah.  Yeah, but you could see those, right?  I don't know how he saw them, maybe.  Yeah, you could see consoles. 
[00:52:00]  What is it?  The console is not the glove box, right?  No, I think it's the in-between box.  And the glove box is a stupid name.  No one fucking...  That's where you put your driving gloves.  I might do in Seinfeld shit.  What?  No one puts driving gloves in the glove box.  Well, if you wear driving gloves, that's where you put them.  You put your stupid registration, that's it.  Yeah.  And the big, giant book that comes with the car that you never looked at.  That's it.  All right, so where are we at?  So the guy, I guess Travolta comes back. 
[00:52:30]  What happened?  How did...  Because the way it says is...  It says the door is...  It says, defendant parked the Lexus on a side street of the Beverly Hills Hotel, and then  it starts on your page.  And we went to one of the bungalows.  Oh, okay.  All right, let's do this.  And we went to one of the bungalows.  All right, so there you go.  You got John Travolta and the masseur.  On the right side, if you're facing the front of the hotel.  So this guy's even telling you which bungalow he was at.  Yeah.  The right side.  All right.  The door was unlocked, and there was an overweight black man preparing hamburgers, who meekly said, 
[00:53:00]  it's all about food.  Hey, plaintiff and defendant, and no formal introductions were made.  All right.  This black man was actually preparing hamburgers.  From watching his skill and dexterity in food preparation, it seemed that he was some sort  of professional chef.  From making hamburgers?  He has to be a professional.  Yeah, how can you tell if someone's a professional chef as they make burgers?  Burgers anyone can make.  You just have to flip those bad boys.  What was he doing to the burgers that made it look like he was... 
[00:53:30]  Probably making them in the shape of men's asses.  Penis burgers.  But if this is true so far, how do you not love Travolta?  If he wanted to hop into his Lexus, fucking eat some cake with some rubbers, and have a  fucking fatso cook them burgers after he was done, he wanted burgers ready.  How big are these bungalows?  I don't know.  But I imagine they're very good for privacy.  They're pretty big?  Probably.  What are they, around the pool?  Don't know.  I would assume so.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and upon such information and belief, states that 
[00:54:00]  defendant shamelessly stripped naked in front of plaintiff.  So what?  He just got undressed in front of the masseur, right?  That's what he said.  Yeah.  The defendant is just Travolta.  So Travolta is shamelessly stripped naked in front of the masseur.  Yeah.  And the chef was gazing at plaintiff as he appeared to be semi-erect.  The chef appeared to be semi-erect?  That's what he said.  And the chef was, and the chef, and was gazing at plaintiff as he appeared to be semi-erect. 
[00:54:30]  That's how it's said.  It's a weird pronoun, but it's, I guess the, who's semi-erect?  Everybody?  I'm guessing.  Everybody!  It sounds to me like this room.  There's just hard cocks all over.  Got hands up, guys.  Yeah.  That's probably what it was.  Is he saying the chef had a ride?  It's right from the burgers.  Let me try this again.  So plaintiff, which is the masseur.  So let's do it this way.  Massur is informed and believes, and upon such information and belief, states that John Travolta  shamelessly stripped naked in front of masseur, and the chef, and was gazing at, oh, no, you 
[00:55:00]  just said it right.  Travolta, he's saying, was semi-erect.  You're sure?  Travolta was gazing at plaintiff as he appeared to be semi-erect.  He was saying, and the chef, and was gazing at masseur as he appeared semi-erect.  He's saying that Travolta was semi-erect.  And everyone was looking at it.  Was everybody looking at it?  Oh, God.  Oh, the cough.  I know.  Oh, my God.  This is the worst. 
[00:55:30]  It's horrible.  I have caught the flu over the years from doing radio with other people.  Please shut the show down.  Just shut the show down.  Everybody's fine.  We'll put worse doves on.  Great material.  I told Blatter yesterday, if you guarantee that this place is being disinfected, I'll continue.  But if you can't guarantee that, then I said to him yesterday, we have to shut the show down.  What does his guarantee mean?  He's just going to tell you that because he wants the show to stay on.  Right.  I don't get sick that long. 
[00:56:00]  I don't get whooping cough.  What do you mean you don't get whooping cough?  Jimmy laughs at the whooping cough.  Exactly.  I laugh at it.  He just laughs at it.  He's going to get it.  And then he's going to give it to me because we're sitting next to each other.  Are you contagious, Jimmy?  You think?  No, I don't.  I am contagious.  Right now?  Yes.  Hallowly.  Put your mask on, Sam, please.  I don't know.  I don't want to hear it.  All right.  So what's happening?  John Travolta.  Oh, God.  Something's in the back.  You see?  Oh, geez.  Oh, my God.  There was a little scratch there.  Yeah, I bet there was.  It's total paranoia. 
[00:56:30]  I'm not even going to front.  I'm so paranoid.  I started feeling it when I was in L.A.  Now I feel like I need a breath of air.  Last Friday, I started feeling this.  Or Thursday.  Last Thursday?  Yeah, I shot something Saturday.  They say it takes five days.  Did they really?  Yeah.  I read up on this whole thing.  You get infected, and then you've got about a five-day period.  Now, when did the Z-Pak work until?  You've got to get that Z-Pak in before you start coughing for it to be completely effective.  Okay.  I think I get it now. 
[00:57:00]  What?  Where do you get a Z-Pak?  The doctor?  I got some Z-Pak.  You don't have any Z-Pak?  Do you really?  I got a lot of Z-Pak.  I need one badly.  I don't believe him, though.  I got him.  He bullshits a lot.  I used to work for the mafia.  Okay.  Me, too.  You don't think I work for the mafia?  Well, shippy D.  You want to bet the check I'm going to give you for your wedding right now?  Nope.  Because I can prove it, too.  Nope.  Come on.  Let's do this.  No, I didn't say...  You know I'm good for a fat check.  Let's put it on the line.  I don't think you still work for the mafia.  You don't? 
[00:57:30]  Nope.  All right.  You want to make that bet?  No.  I'm not betting my wedding check.  It's a fat check, too.  Is it?  But let's see how brave you are.  Do I or do I not have ties to the mafia right now?  I'm not betting, no.  I need that check.  All right.  Fair enough.  So who's erect?  John Travolta's erect.  And everyone is gazing at his semi-erection.  That's what I think is happening here, Jimmy.  Do you think that's...  I mean, if...  I think that he knows...  I'm assuming if John Travolta is naked in front of you and you're the chef, you're taking 
[00:58:00]  a look at his semi-erect fucking penis.  I imagine you've seen it before, if that's the case.  But you are looking.  Yeah.  It doesn't mean you're gay.  You're looking.  As a human, you're just looking, right?  I'm guessing.  Sure.  All right.  So plaintiff asked defendant to lie face down and to drape himself with a towel.  Defendant started muttering to himself something along the lines of, he wants me to get on  the table.  Can you believe that?  He wants me to get on the table. 
[00:58:30]  What does that mean, Jimmy?  That's how you get a fucking massage.  Watch me.  But it sounds to me like he could have been joking.  Like, he could have been joking with the, uh, like, flirting, almost.  Right.  Like, he wants me to get on the table.  You believe this guy wants me to get on this table?  Like, he might have been joking with him in the...  I don't believe he was muttering and angry.  You don't hire a massage and then get mad when they want you to get on the table.  Right.  I don't believe that.  I don't think Travolta's a psycho. 
[00:59:00]  All right.  Plaintiff is informed and believes...  This is where the Hollywood Report is stamped over this, so bear with me.  Every paragraph starts with that, is informed and believes.  Okay.  And upon such information and belief, states the defendant had his watch on during the  massage.  For the first hour, the massage was without incident, other than he kept purposely sliding  the towel down that covered his butt to reveal about half... 
[00:59:30]  Half of gluteus area.  Of gluteus area.  Okay.  He wanted to show the cheeks off.  I pulled that check many times.  A little bit of the butt cheek showing?  Yeah.  I want to get a finger in there.  Yeah?  Let's get the finger going.  So there's a massage going on and Travolta keeps pushing the towel down.  I've done that many times, having a chick do that, and hopefully they get up there  and get right in those glutes.  I want to work those glutes.  Florentine's here.  We should get him right in.  Absolutely.  I forgot he was coming from me.  We need healthy voices.  Get him right in.  Yeah, tell him... 
[01:00:00]  Get him right in.  I'll tell him what's going on here.  Oh God, I just kind of snorted some fucking snot back in.  Let me breathe.  I sound good.  You sure you want to broadcast today?  Hi, buddy.  You hear what's going on?  Yeah, I've been hearing what's going on driving in.  Don't use that microphone, first of all.  Don't use that one.  Let me...  Where am I...  Which one?  That might be okay.  This is the one.  The place was disinfected, but we think Ann has the whooping cough. 
[01:00:30]  I don't know if he officially went to a doctor.  I have no idea.  I don't know if he went on WebMD and diagnosed himself.  I have no idea.  But all indications are he has the whooping cough, also known as pertussis.  Yeah, I know what it is.  Are you worried about it?  How's your voice?  Everything good?  No, everything's good with me.  Yeah, I got a kid at home that I got to be careful.  Exactly.  Did he get his shots?  Yeah, but pertussis, you got to get like four different shots for kids. 
[01:01:00]  It goes in phases.  It goes like at three months, then I think at six, then a year, and then like two years,  something like that.  It goes in four different...  So my kid might have got three out of the four.  Is he good?  Yeah, he's probably at three out of four.  All right.  And your kids are about the same then?  He's at like two, two out of four.  All right.  So he might get a little whooping cough.  A slight case, though.  It should go great.  Just a slight case.  We're all really...  But I was doing...  So Anthony hasn't been in here since Friday.  Yeah.  All right.  So that's good.  So I had the weekend to get... 
[01:01:30]  Supposedly, they disinfected this place.  But if they do, they're disinfecting like they do everything else around here.  Trust me, we'll all have the whooping cough.  They do everything half-assed.  Yeah, I feel sick, Jim.  Look at...  See?  He does.  Do you want to go home?  I don't blame you.  I don't blame you.  What the hell did I walk in there?  I just wanted to plug my governor's gig.  I don't know.  You want to broadcast from that booth?  He could be like a bubble boy.  Oh, I could be in there?  He really...  Look.  And he might be just...  He might be five days behind him, which would make sense, because... 
[01:02:00]  Is there any masks left?  You want a mask?  I was using this.  If Sam was using it, that would be good.  If we have one next-care mask, we're not prepared for hazards.  Shut the face.  Why are we still doing a show?  Quiet, churnophobe.  Man up.  Have a fucking Ludens.  Shut up.  You have it already.  You're not worried.  No, why would I be?  We're going to do a cough a little bit?  Fucking relax.  So far, Jimmy just has a regular cough, which is possible, Sam.  I'm going to take a Z-Pak.  I'll live. 
[01:02:30]  I'm not that fucking fat chick in Britain.  My immune system rules.  I don't give a...  I just worry about the kid.  That's it.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm much more likely to give by the kids, though.  I'll take the whooping cough, because like I told Jimmy, how great would it be to do  a whole radio show with the whooping cough?  That's something no one has ever fucking done.  I would do that.  But I just want to make sure my kid's all right.  That's it.  And that's what I told Bladder yesterday, because I wanted to shut this motherfucker down  for a while.  Yeah.  Well, I think if it was that serious, they probably wouldn't even let you guys broadcast.  Oh, really? 
[01:03:00]  Don't you think?  They don't have three days on the table.  You do work for this place, right?  Yeah, but didn't they have a problem with some kind of bugs or something?  Oh, yeah.  They said they got rid of bed bugs within an hour.  They had a dumb dog sniff around.  They sprayed a few things, and they say that everything's good.  All right, but no one brought home bed bugs.  I don't know.  No.  I don't talk to these people.  We're in the middle of talking about John Travolta.  They'll love this.  You do love this?  Yeah.  All right.  So, John Travolta, just to catch you up there, Florentine, he's getting his massage. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, I read the whole story.  Okay, he's in the bungalow.  Some chef is cooking burgers.  And the first hour of the massage, normal.  But Travolta keeps sort of letting the towel move down his butt.  As every good massage client will do.  You know how many times I've tried to open the legs to get the asshole up trick?  Every time.  How do you get the asshole up?  Just push your ass like a cat.  That looked just stupid.  Yeah, if you spread your legs a little, a towel, you know, the little knot in the front will open up. 
[01:04:00]  Undo?  Yeah.  They never have a knot.  It's never tied.  No, I don't.  Yeah, I don't knot either, man.  Because you can't lay on the knot.  Well, not so much a knot, but a little kind of thing there.  Never tied.  Yeah.  Never.  So, now the towel's working its way down, and the butt is out a little bit.  Plaintiff kept sliding the towel back up.  So, the masseur kept sliding the towel back up.  And reminding John Travolta that state law required that a massage client be fully draped during the massage.  This back-and-forth activity of John Travolta sliding it down, and then the masseur would slide it back up, occurred over ten times in the first hour. 
[01:04:30]  Once every six minutes, he just had to pop that asshole out.  But this guy went back to Travolta's hotel, right?  It's the Beverly Hills Hotel with the bungalows, I guess.  The bungalows.  So, I mean, it's not like he wasn't at the guy's business.  You know, I can see where he wouldn't.  He picked them up.  Right, but Travolta wasn't going into his, you know, business in a strip mall and then trying to pull his.  This guy's going to basically his bungalow, so anything goes. 
[01:05:00]  You don't have to have the towel on.  There you go.  This guy's trying to be too legit.  That's right.  Just get in there.  Get those fingers dirty.  If you're going to someone's private home, 90% some shit's going down.  If you're a massage therapist, you've got to expect that.  Yeah.  Maybe this is a little different.  Yeah, I mean, a gym knows the odds.  Yeah, it's 100%.  100%.  But if you go to a massage place in a strip mall?  About 30.  Okay.  25 to 30.  Masseur is informed and believes, and upon such information and belief, states that right before the hour ended, 
[01:05:30]  John Travolta chronograph watch started to chime, and the black chef covered the burgers and other things he was preparing with plates.  So what?  Was that some kind of sign?  When you hear my watch go off, you fucking cover the food, get the fuck out of here?  Yeah, cover the burgers and get out, because I need a fucking dick and a burger when I'm done.  Maybe you didn't want to arc one on the food.  The black chef then left the room with a stack of papers and what appeared to be some sort of notebook. 
[01:06:00]  No words were exchanged.  So just out of nowhere, Travolta's watch goes off, and the chef did all this stuff and got the fuck out of there.  Wait, so the chef was in the room when the massage was going on?  Yeah, he's making burgers.  Okay, so then it was like his cue to leave.  But that doesn't make sense, because was he eating burgers in the middle of getting a massage?  Because burgers aren't going to keep for an hour.  No, they might.  No, man.  You want to eat the burgers immediately after they're cooked.  No, reheating burgers suck.  They're the worst. 
[01:06:30]  Was he cooking them, though, or just preparing them?  He might have just been making them.  Oh, like kind of making the patties?  Yeah.  Kind of doing...  Yeah.  There's no way Travolta's this out of control to have his chef there, his personal chef there,  and trying to, you know, take his towel off and get jerked off in front of us.  There's no way he would do...  Maybe one-on-one, and then he could just say, it wasn't me, but he's not going to do it with a chef in the room.  But if the chef is the guy you're close to...  I still don't.  Now you've got a witness.  Like, no, man, this is what we do.  I'm cooking fucking food, and he gets his massage.  That's crazy. 
[01:07:00]  Unless it's a set-up thing where if something like this happens, the chef can go, look, I was there.  Nothing happened.  Right, exactly.  I have an agreement.  Exactly.  Or if the chef is a partner of his.  Like, you never know people...  You know, they might fuck.  Who knows?  Masseur is informed and believes, and upon such information and belief...  I fucking hate lawyer talk.  Yeah.  ...and belief states that John Travolta started to rub the Masseur's leg, and Masseur thought it was accidental.  No, he didn't.  So what? 
[01:07:30]  John Travolta's rubbing your leg, and then at first you're thinking that's accidental.  Masseur moved away, and John Travolta stopped trying to touch Masseur for a few minutes.  Masseur assumed that it was, in fact, accidental.  Then John Travolta touched Masseur's scrotum.  Went right for the bag.  How, though?  Is the guy in jeans?  He's not nature.  Did he just grab his package?  Maybe he's in...  A little shorty shorts?  Maybe he gave the old brush against the fucking bag, because he might be in... 
[01:08:00]  I don't know what massage guys wear, but massage chicks, when they wear massage pants, are very fucking soft.  By the way, this is a really good point.  What guy orders another guy for a massage?  That's a little rough.  Well, I might...  I've had a guy rub me down, and it's just fucking...  You can't get comfortable.  At what point did you grab him?  Well...  It's just that I didn't like it.  You know, but they do fucking work the muscles pretty good.  Good sports massage. 
[01:08:30]  Did you have the towel on?  Fuck yeah.  I had a fucking raincoat on.  Yeah.  You didn't feel anything?  No.  No, no, no.  No.  All right.  I hope you get the whooping cough.  Fuck.  You fuck.  So what happened next?  Oh.  Then John Travolta touched Masseur's scrotum, and this time Masseur told John Travolta to please not touch him again.  John Travolta apologized, but then snickered to himself like a mischievous child. 
[01:09:00]  Tee hee hee.  John Travolta then touched the shaft.  Of Masseur's penis.  See, now how is he getting a shaft?  This guy's got me naked.  Exactly.  Jim, can you explain this?  Is a masseuse a guy going to show up in, like, jeans to do this?  No, they would probably wear massage pants, which would look, like, whatever they're made out of.  It was like hospital pants.  Yeah, or something.  But you don't have to exactly be a marksman to hit a shaft. 
[01:09:30]  You kind of know the area, so he may have just been grabbing at it.  Like, that could legitimately be the Masseur just massaging him with clothes and getting a shaft.  It's starting to sound like it.  Well, when I don't have an erection, I don't even have a shaft, so this guy must have been getting hard.  I don't know if this guy might be blessed.  Something is going on here.  We don't know if the Masseur was naked there, Travis.  I don't know.  You read the whole complaint?  No, it doesn't say anything, but that is a great point.  How are you just going to grab the shaft?  I don't know.  And where did he meet this guy?  Was it on Craigslist? 
[01:10:00]  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  That's another thing.  A lot of vague stuff here.  John Travolta then touched the shaft of the Masseur's penis and seized onto it.  So that means he's grabbing it.  That means the guy's got to have no pants on.  No, you just grab it in the pants.  Seized onto it?  Yeah.  What does seized mean?  With his hand, he seized it.  Yeah, grabbing fucking hole.  Yeah, grab this.  John Travolta quickly tried to rub the head.  And now he's rubbing the head.  I know.  Come on.  This guy is naked, Jimmy.  He's got to be naked. 
[01:10:30]  I don't think he is.  Unless he's in those tight stretch jeans like the chicks wear.  Maybe he was wearing them.  But still, I mean, his shaft, his helmet, his scrotum.  Right.  Come on.  He went scrotum, shaft, and now he's rubbing the head.  Quickly tried to rub the head.  Was he fondling the vein, too?  Right.  Masseur's penis as he tried to pull away.  This was painful and uncomfortable.  John Travolta started to apologize for his behavior and try to imply that they must have gotten our signals crossed. 
[01:11:00]  And that he thought that Masseur wanted the same thing he did.  Up till now, this whole thing seems weird, but believable.  Okay.  Okay, sir.  Because I've had that same discussion with women.  Like, oh, I thought, you know, no.  I wouldn't say signals crossed, but.  Right.  But Masseur explained that he did not have sex with his clients and that expecting sexual situations when people are providing paid services was essentially prostitution. 
[01:11:30]  John Travolta then tried to act like it was a simple misunderstanding.  Plaintiff is informed and believes, and upon such information and belief, states that John Travolta then sat up on the table and asked Masseur to switch places and do a reverse massage.  Have you ever done a reverse massage?  Yes.  I had a woman with a really juicy rump and she was massaging me. 
[01:12:00]  We were talking and I got the vibe, but she was close to the asshole in the back of the dick vein.  And I was joking with her about her pants and whatever.  And she says, I'm like, I had a fun ass to massage.  She said something that was like, I knew.  So then I was like, well, we should teach me how to massage yours in case I ever, you know, have to massage a girl.  I was like, I was joking.  And she goes, do you want to rub my ass?  I'm like, well, yeah.  So she gets on the table and she slides it down, her pants down.  It was hot.  So I'm rubbing her ass and I just started licking her cheeks and I went down on her. 
[01:12:30]  And she told me I was the first guy to ever make her cum going down on her.  You flipped her over or was from that?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She had a hairy pussy too.  It was like three or four years ago.  Is she good looking?  Yeah.  Not amazing.  One to ten.  Six?  All right.  Don't look at my semi-directed penis, please.  Believe me.  You're going to lower my chair.  How much did that cost?  Was that extra?  I don't remember.  I don't remember.  Feetabox?  I think I threw a nice tip at her.  There you go.  A little something for you. 
[01:13:00]  A little something for your troubles.  A little trouble.  Masseur told John Travolta that a masseuse, the Hollywood reporter stamped over this part,  masseuse lying on the table, was unlawful and inappropriate.  Okay, this is the reverse massage thing, so he's saying no to that.  Then John Travolta said, come on, dude, I'll jerk you off.  Look, at that, you know, if this is true, you're at that point where you're desperate. 
[01:13:30]  You know, he's got a rod and he's like, come on.  And he wants to get to the hamburgers.  Yeah.  Chef's coming back soon.  Yeah.  Still smoothing all the paperwork.  This is great.  I don't buy it, but.  Hey, can I get one of those?  Sure.  Well, Kenny bought it, man.  You got one over there.  Where's my emergency?  I don't have an emergency.  Oh, I do have an emergency.  Kenny is on.  You think the whooping cough is beyond emergencies help?  Yeah.  It can't hurt. 
[01:14:00]  Took a cold ease, too.  Yeah, it can't hurt, but yeah, this is really not going to do much.  I mean, come on.  You really needed to be here, huh?  I didn't know until I was driving in.  I'm like, what the fuck is going on?  I said, fuck it.  I just figure at this point, I have to have it.  Oh.  Oh, I mean, he was here all week.  Coughing and shit.  That's true, so I don't want to get in the blame.  I either have it or don't at this point.  You know, nothing I can do. 
[01:14:30]  Do you have coffee?  It should show up within like 48 hours, usually.  Five days or something.  If you catch something.  Five days, then a sneeze, then a cough, and then you're like gasping for air, and that's  where the whooping comes from.  I've got the whooping cough.  And some people break ribs.  They're coughing so much.  Yeah.  I ain't got no whooping cough.  It's a regular cough.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Breathe in.  Without coughing.  Thank you.  That was good, right?  You want to get on the table?  Oh, sorry.  You're talking to the intern.  You can't talk to the intern like that. 
[01:15:00]  I just said you want to get on the table.  Why not?  Come on, dude.  At this point, Masseur was done.  Masseur told John Travolta he just wanted to leave, that this situation was too strange,  and that he actually felt very afraid for his safety.  I don't believe that part.  John Travolta then laid...  Yeah, you're at the Beverly Hills Hotel in a bungalow.  You're scared for your safety?  Stop.  There's a lot of people probably right outside that bungalow.  Chubby John Travolta.  John Travolta then laid down on the table and said, okay, I'll behave myself.  John Travolta neatly placed the towel in an appropriate manner in his lap and gave 
[01:15:30]  Masseur confidence that his predatory behavior was finally under control.  I don't like that lawyer language right there, the predatory behavior.  No, I think at that point it's over and you leave, so that's bullshit.  He's going to convince you to stay, really?  After he's touching your fucking mushroom head and stroking your shaft and jiggling your balls?  And then he convinces you to stay, shut up, fuck yourself.  I've been in this position before, though, where the masseuse was uncomfortable. 
[01:16:00]  Right.  And you've got to make good, because then you start thinking, like, okay, I don't want them to panic and say anything.  So you start trying to make good.  Like, I'll be good.  And then you have kind of, well, you know, I've had that happen, too.  All right.  Let's see.  So we've got his behavior under control.  Masseur is informed of believes, and upon such information and believes, states that John Travolta asked Masseur to work on his shoulders.  And Masseur followed his request with a professional deep tissue massage on his shoulders. 
[01:16:30]  John Travolta then said, say something nice to me.  Masseur tried to ignore what John Travolta said, but he's still rubbing his shoulders.  This guy was hoping that some shit would go down so he could sue him, probably.  Why would you stay?  Look, if this guy, if this guy, and he's going to different, you know, houses and hotel rooms in Hollywood to massage other men, he's been in this situation a lot of times. 
[01:17:00]  And maybe he's worried that now, you know, Travolta talks, and then he doesn't get as much work or something?  No, not talk, but he's been, like, this guy's on the scene, like, this is the first time.  Like, hey, I'm getting out of here, you know, all this stuff.  Stop doing it.  It's like you could have just left.  Once a guy grabs your cock, you can go look.  It's time to go.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, if I was giving out massage and a guy did that to me and grabbed my mule, I'd leave.  Game over, right?  Yeah.  You'd clean the cum off the front of your chest.  Game over, because you can't.  Get his number, and then go, all right, next time I'm desperate, I'll give you a call. 
[01:17:30]  Masseur tried to ignore what John Travolta said and was hoping to conclude this session.  Masseur looked at John Travolta, who had removed his draping and was masturbating.  John Travolta's penis was fully erect and was roughly eight inches in length.  Nice.  And his pubic hair was wiry and unkept.  Boo.  Sweat was pouring down John Travolta's neck, and he asked Masseur again to say something 
[01:18:00]  nice to him.  Oh, God.  How awful.  His fucking wig was probably hanging off like half glued to his head, dangling backwards.  How creepy.  Masseur is informed and believes, and upon such information and belief, states that he refused.  Masseur moved away from John Travolta, who then lumbered to his feet and began to move  towards Masseur with an erect penis bouncing around with its stride.  That cock was aching from Masseur's touch. 
[01:18:30]  Holy fuck.  John Travolta began screaming at Masseur, telling Masseur how selfish he was that John Travolta  got where he is now due to sexual favors he had performed when he was in his Welcome  Back Cotter days.  I don't know about that.  He's only a star because he was fucking what?  Playing the game.  Yeah.  And that Hollywood is controlled by homosexual Jewish men who expected favors in return for  sexual activity. 
[01:19:00]  John Travolta then went on to say how he had done things in his past that would make most  people throw up.  Whoa.  Oh, John Travolta explained when he started that he wasn't even gay and that the taste  of cum would make him gag.  John Travolta also said that he was smart enough to learn to enjoy it.  And when he began to make millions of dollars, that it all became well worth it. 
[01:19:30]  Okay, so why is he doing with this guy where he's going to get nothing out of?  Well, now he likes to cum.  Now all of a sudden he likes to cum.  Wasn't gay.  Didn't like cum at first.  But after all this time.  Now he's like, what he's saying to this guy is, I can help you.  You should do this.  He's saying like, hey, look, I was in your position and look what happened to me.  He's like, hey, dummy, I'm giving you a chance here to suck my John Travolta dick. 
[01:20:00]  That's what this guy's implying that he's saying.  Right.  And maybe it was a little fucking little John Travolta type mafia of other people that  he could like, you know, turn this guy on to, to make more money.  John Travolta further explained that the high class in this world always favor same-sex  relationships.  That sex was beautiful.  Fit men is actually more intense.  And if the sewer would just be open-minded enough to let it happen, he would experience  the best fucking of his life.  If, wow, this is Travolta, if this is, if this was accurate, imagine it all is, but 
[01:20:30]  no one's going to believe this guy.  I think a lot of people will believe him because there's been rumors about Travolta.  There's that weird picture.  Yeah.  My, my opinion is that he is gay.  It's, it's, it's simply an opinion.  Right.  Because I saw that picture.  It looked like you was kissing the guy on the plane steps.  Right.  But I don't give a fuck.  Who cares?  It's like, yeah, there's been stories like in the Acquirer.  Allegedly he was in a hot tub or a steam room and he grabbed the guy.  And he was getting, you know, so this stuff's been going on for a while. 
[01:21:00]  The reason I believe this more than I would, like, I have never been this, I've had weird  interaction with chicks, with chicks, you're always afraid of a rape charge, though.  Like, you're always, there's, you know, one man's not going to go and say you raped  them.  Right.  With a girl, you got to be careful, though, because it's like, I never want them saying  I tried to fucking force them.  But when you get to that level of fame and that level of entitlement, it's easy to imagine  you'd say embarrassing things like that.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, I could, you look like, how could you say that to somebody? 
[01:21:30]  But if you're that famous and you've been that famous since 1978, you're probably so  used to getting what you want that you'll say, like, come on, man, when I was doing what  you're doing, I would fucking suck dick and take cum and I made millions.  What's the matter with you?  Yeah.  That's a good point.  And at this point, he doesn't give a fuck.  He just doesn't give a fuck.  He's a made man.  I mean, John Travolta knows he's not going to lose work in Hollywood.  But he's beyond a celebrity, not only a big Scientologist, his wife's got to be just  fucking cool with whatever he does. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Unless this is all complete bullshit, what we've heard over the years.  Masseur is informed and believes and upon such information and belief states that he told  John Travolta to get dressed and to either drive Masseur back or Masseur is going to call  the police.  This guy is, I'm sorry, he's just full of shit.  So he doesn't have his own car?  You would just leave and figure it out.  You'd call a friend of yours or something.  Especially if you're at a hotel, you'd go right out front and pick up a cab.  Exactly.  Or at the very worst, jump on a bus. 
[01:22:30]  You're now insisting that John Travolta drives you home?  Well, they met, the cars met somewhere.  Actually, I read this part of the story.  Right.  And then Travolta met him somewhere and then picked him up, which is weird.  You're not, you're not.  Why wouldn't you just meet him at the hotel or follow him at a hotel?  Well, my only guess I have is that maybe he's a ritual creature.  Maybe there's something about this arrangement that he likes.  Maybe he likes going to pick the guy up.  And if the guy is ugly or fat, he just drives away. 
[01:23:00]  Or if the guy, if there's paparazzi around, maybe he just drives away.  Maybe he does that because this way any weird thing that can happen, he can drive away.  He's controlling the situation.  Instead of it being at his hotel where there's people watching.  Yeah, you're right.  And all of a sudden the guy pulls up and he's just a fat, slobby guy.  Then maybe he just drives away.  No, I mean if the guy drove himself.  But at this point, to say that he insisted John Travolta drives him home, no way.  What?  If you're in any type of situation in your life, you want to get the fuck out of it as quickly as possible. 
[01:23:30]  You don't stay in the situation, right?  There's no way.  Yeah, this guy's taking a lot of abuse and not leaving.  Right.  And now insisting that he drives him home?  I'll bet this guy gave different signals too.  He probably, because I've had chicks give signals like where they're rubbing you and they graze.  They do things which indicate that we're on the same page, but then they get weird when you try to make it sexual.  That happens a lot.  It's like they want to tease you a little bit, but then all of a sudden when you try to acknowledge it for what it is, 
[01:24:00]  it's like, oh, what do you know?  I don't do that.  Which is irritating.  Right.  But I've had some that I knew just didn't do it.  Most, actually.  Right.  Of the legit ones.  You can just sense don't do it.  And they don't, it's all in body language and it's all in the way they drape you and you just know.  I understand what you're saying, but I'm to the part where now you're telling Travolta to drive you home?  Yeah.  In what world would that actually happen?  Well, I'm betting this guy gave him signals.  I'm betting this guy was not as 100% rigorous.  Because it's like, if I was with somebody and she was 100% rigorous the entire time, it wouldn't turn me on to pursue it because there was no signals at all. 
[01:24:30]  Okay.  Unless you get that famous and just expect it from everybody.  I don't know.  All right.  So he insists that Travolta drives him home, insists that he puts his clothes on first and then drive him home, or he's going to call the police.  Okay, strangely, John Travolta's penis was still semi-erect.  How do you not respect Travolta?  This guy fucking...  I know.  He's still got a rod through all of this.  Yeah, nothing deters him.  He probably had to say I was a rod, though.  If you think he's that hard... 
[01:25:00]  Maybe he's that harder.  Yeah, maybe he likes to struggle.  And he had to struggle to get it back into his underwear and jeans since he pulled his underwear and pants up at the same time.  I've never had that problem.  Me neither.  Struggled up to get back in.  Ever.  No.  No.  Defendant then said, no problem.  John Travolta obviously said, no problem.  I will find new friends.  How old is he, seven?  John Travolta then continued to say that Hollywood is all about giving and getting.  And then he told Masseur that he could show me an instant example. 
[01:25:30]  John Travolta told Masseur he knew a Hollywood starlet in the building that wanted three-way sex and to be double penetrated.  What?  John Travolta said they could have that later, but first they needed to have sex together first before calling her.  So this way they would be in sync with each other sexually.  If this had all happened, by the way, do you not think that the fucking massage therapist is giving him conversation back? 
[01:26:00]  You're not just firing this out at two years.  Yeah, you're not just sitting there and going, really?  What else?  This is a starlet.  And then the guy says nothing.  We need to fuck first.  Really?  And the guy said nothing?  Now I understand why Travolta took ten years off in his movie career.  He didn't have time to make movies.  Trying to make all these sexual deals.  Juggle and cum.  Holy fuck.  John Travolta told Masseur that he had Hollywood looks, but just needed to lose some weight and learn to lick some ass.  And then Masseur would be ready to make millions and be famous. 
[01:26:30]  Well, that is Hollywood.  Everyone's trying to make it, right?  Yeah, but it's just so funny.  Waiters and waitresses.  Masseur is informed and believes, and upon such information and belief, states that he reiterated his threat to call the police.  And John Travolta took Masseur back to where he was picked up.  During this ride, John Travolta repeatedly called Masseur selfish and a loser.  And gave Masseur double what he was owed.  This was $800 instead of the $400 that John Travolta was supposed to pay Masseur for the two hours of massage time spent. 
[01:27:00]  Now, let's say that the massage therapist, let's just play devil's advocate and say that he was this guy, not gay, and he's an actor.  And you get, and you look in the lectures and it's Travolta.  And you're like, oh my fucking, you've worked at other celebrities, so you, it's not weird for you to touch other men or whatever, because you've massaged people before.  And you see it's Travolta, and you're like, oh, this is great. 
[01:27:30]  And then he starts acting up, and you're like, oh, fuck.  Oh, no.  I heard, but God.  I'm wide, baby.  It's all wiry as pubes.  Oh, God.  Unkept.  Unkept.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, jeez.  Jeez, Louise.  Oh, boy.  Now what?  Interesting.  $2 million, a lot of money from a cock grabber.  Now, do you think Travolta would get back in the truck and drive with him back to where his car was after all this? 
[01:28:00]  Wouldn't he just say, hey, get his assistant, I'm sure he had somebody there, or here, take him back, I'm done with him.  It goes back to Jim's point that he wants to make sure everything's cool, I guess.  But then again, if he's still insulting the guy, I can find all of this believable.  I do think what's being left out is the masseur, it sounds to me that he's leaving out certain details about his own intrigue behavior.  And again, the X factor that Travolta's so famous, maybe when you're that famous, or maybe when you're not, you get so entitled that you don't care what the other person thinks at all. 
[01:28:30]  Like, I could never pursue it that hard if the chick was giving me signals that it was not at all.  But then they give you these other weird signals back.  Like, the mixed messages are the hardest ones.  The ones that are 100% legit, it's never an issue, like you always know.  Like, you go to a spa, you're not getting jerked off, ever.  It's just not happening.  They're going to drape you a certain way, they rub up to the back of your thigh a certain... 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, they won't massage your cheeks.  Nah, or if they do, I've gotten glute massages in there.  They tuck the fucking sheet between your ass cheeks like a fucking toga.  Like, you know, by every move they make, it's not sensual.  They spend more time making sure the sheet is properly placed as they move from body part to body part.  They're tucking and folding, right?  And part of that is they want to know...  Part of that is also so you don't get the wrong signal.  Right.  But you just know by the way they stop short of your asshole, or the way they stop short of your balls, or the area right around your ball. 
[01:29:30]  Well, you know when they are giving you a legit rub down, and you know when they're fucking...  In every fucking massage I've ever gotten, I should have a bell, and I could just hit it at the moment that it goes over the line.  Yeah.  Yeah, they'll brush the back of your sack accidentally.  But then sometimes they act like that they...  Some of them just do that.  Some of them will just give you a sensual rub with no jerky.  And then you start jerking off, and all of a sudden, oh...  It's like they want to be sexy and get a little tip. 
[01:30:00]  But as soon as you tug your dick, it's like, oh, that's what this is.  I can't do that.  Yeah.  It's annoying.  More importantly, someone is tweeting Mr. Jim Florentine, and that's what Jim's Twitter is.  Mr. Jim Florentine.  How many wrestling photos would you get for blowing Travolta, Jim?  Oh, that's...  That's...  You'd get the whole collection, I'm thinking.  Oh, yeah, I would...  Yeah, I'd...  Every imaginable photo out there you would get if you blew John Travolta.  I'd probably be the manager for one of the matches. 
[01:30:30]  So, I'd sit right next to Freddie Blassie.  Yeah, I mean, I have 14.  And Travolta did that, and he had all those wrestling pictures.  I mean, you know.  Yeah.  Because he was handsome back in the day.  I'll say...  The guy that I was kissing was a big, fat slob.  Yeah.  He kissed the guy?  Well, on the cheek.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, we went through it.  No, it's one of the best stories ever told in this show.  It's amazing.  It really is amazing.  Do you know the most interesting...  I mean, there was a lot of interesting stuff in Jim's one-man show.  But after we talked, and he still has that fucking photo album. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  Dude, I'm dying to see that.  Yeah, can you bring it up next time?  I got to bring it in next time, yeah.  I'm dying to see that, dude.  Because I wrote in, like, black paint on a wrestling picture album, and it's real creepy.  It's an old album.  It has all the pictures in it.  Yeah.  It's the greatest.  What a little jerk.  I keep clearing my throat.  Kenny said...  Are you clearing your throat a lot, Sam?  Yeah, and I'm actually...  I can feel a cough, but I'm avoiding coughing, because I don't want to acknowledge that it's  there.  Right.  But...  I feel like... 
[01:31:30]  My throat feels really weird.  So does mine.  Kenny thinks...  I'm just paranoid, though.  Yeah, Kenny thinks if we were sick, we would have it already, because the aunt was sick for  two...  For a week or two weeks or whatever it was.  He was sick a while.  And then I thought it went away, and then it came back strong.  Usually, if you pick up a bug, it's within 48 hours.  So you're already at Friday.  If he was here Friday to today's Tuesday...  Yeah, but Jimmy's bringing in a new sickness.  That's 72.  Jimmy came back from L.A. like this.  He's always coughing, though.  So I'm within the two-day period with this.  Yeah, but he was out in L.A., so he wasn't here. 
[01:32:00]  Were you here Friday?  No, he's gone all week.  All right, so...  And he hasn't been sleeping.  Like, rest...  When you get worn out...  I get more likely to get sick.  But you start showing those symptoms.  And I was on the planes and shit.  I know.  I got the start of gulps.  You know that gulp thing?  Sure.  Because you're trying to keep your throat...  I get it when I massage celebrities.  Get it.  Yes, I get it.  I texted Jess to call the doctor to get Z-Pak prescriptions.  Yeah, I already texted her.  You got to get it for the whole family, though. 
[01:32:30]  Because you could have infected everybody by now.  It's me and Jess.  I got some Z-Paks.  How many do you need?  I need two.  I need one, man.  Badly.  Two and one, three.  No problem.  You got it?  Yeah.  I forget you have these connections.  One text.  We're going to go to break with Donald Sutherland a bit.  Florentine, what do we got?  Governors?  Yeah, Governors this Friday night in Levittown.  And then Saturday, they have another club out now.  Bohemia.  McGuire's.  They took that one over.  Did they really?  Yeah, they bought all the clubs, right?  God, they got everything.  They bought two.  And they got the brokerage, too. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, they got most of the Long Island clubs at this point.  All three clubs, yeah.  So Friday.  The brokerage was great.  Yeah, I wanted to get into that world, but I did some research.  What?  I'm just saying.  Oh, with the comedy?  I almost opened up a comedy club on Long Island and did some research.  That's all I'm saying.  It's a tough market.  It is.  That's what I'm saying.  It's not an easy life.  All right.  We'll be back, but first this.  News of the world. 
[01:33:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Hollywood radio show to the stars.  Silver screen heavy hitter Donald Sutherland was on the Opie and Anthony show and had a ball.  Jesus, this is the most depressing show.  I feel totally alienated.  And you actually have listeners.  Mr. Movie Magic Donald Sutherland told all he was more starstruck by both the Opie and Anthony fellas than they of him.  When I came in here, I was just terrified.  Absolutely terrified.  Who booked me into this show?  Donald! 
[01:34:00]  Donald!  Before you leave us, tell us, please.  Did you have fun with Opie and Anthony?  Did I have fun here?  Oh, I'm so happy it's finished.  Stay tuned as News of the World continues to take an inside look at the lives of silver screen studs and starlets on Opie and Anthony, Hollywood radio show to the stars.  Sirius XM, the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:34:30]  All right, let's do this.  We got Jim Florentine in studio playing Governors this weekend on Friday.  And then you move over to the other club on Saturday?  Friday is Levittown.  Saturday is Bohemia McGuire's.  Very cool.  Have you been on Long Island in a while?  No, I haven't done a while in Long Island in a while, yeah.  My sister and Fast Eddie always say, hey, tell Jim Florentine I said hi.  He used to come to Fast Eddie's.  I remember Fast Eddie's.  With the long hair.  Yeah, he's still doing it.  He's still doing common hair?  No. 
[01:35:00]  He's just still alive.  I love Fast Eddie's.  Bob Levy used to bring us there, me and Jim, the open forum.  Remember Fast Eddie's?  I'd work with Otto a lot there, too.  That means I probably met Norton way before we started working together.  I didn't even know it.  It was so many years ago I worked with Otto.  It had to be.  Here's how I remember.  I worked there with Otto, and somebody, Otto said to some guy in the crowd, the guy had  curly hair, and Otto said something about your great-great-grandmother.  I didn't want to do the line, but he just started doing the fucking, the bit that Walken did, and Dennis Hopper from True Romance. 
[01:35:30]  True Romance, right.  The fuck, where he's telling them your family is niggers, and you know, that fucking thing.  He wants to get himself killed.  Yeah, we played it on our show.  Otto started doing that to somebody in the audience, and I hadn't seen Pulp Fiction yet, or whatever the movie was.  True Romance.  Yeah, True Romance.  I was like, what the fuck is he doing?  I didn't realize he was doing a movie live.  The movie was still in the theaters.  Right.  But that's one of the last times I worked at Fast Eddie's, whenever that was.  That's a long time ago.  Because it was a Tuesday night, and the show didn't start at like 11 o'clock.  It was that late, right? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, it was really late.  That was the first time I had to do like 25 minutes.  Levy brought me, and he told Fast Eddie, he said, no, this guy's great, and I had like 10.  Really?  Yeah, and I bailed at like 16 minutes.  How'd you do?  I probably met...  Not good.  I met all you guys before.  Oh, you did it all the time?  I probably had no idea.  Once every six weeks, I would do it.  I did Fast Eddie's a shitload, man.  Where was the stage?  I vaguely remember.  We went up the stairs and took the quick left, you know what I mean?  Left into the joint, and the stage was right there.  Yeah, and we got like 75 bucks on a Tuesday night, which was great. 
[01:36:30]  They never headlined that room.  He paid pretty well, considering.  He did all right.  I worked there with fucking George Gallo, Otto, of course, Levy, you.  Fast Eddie's mistake, the two main bartenders were his son and my sister, and they literally  had to, I mean had to give away the bar, because everyone was coming up there.  So you felt guilty charging anybody.  Because we were all coming up, because they were bartending, and so then we're all getting 
[01:37:00]  our drinks for free.  I probably did meet you at one point there.  You absolutely did.  We probably both had on your sister, too.  Yeah, she was pretty hot.  Yeah.  She bartended there.  Yeah.  Otto, I wish I had a story.  Oh, God, I hope you don't.  I hope you don't, man.  God, please don't.  I wish I did.  Please, no.  Anyway, UFC is not coming to New York.  They KO'd it again there, Jimmy.  I didn't even vote on it. 
[01:37:30]  That scumbag Sheldon Silver.  Well, what is his deal?  He's a scumbag, and I think it's a lot of these older people.  He's the speaker.  He's a fucking cocksucker.  The speaker of Sheldon Silver determined the votes weren't there for it to pass.  The UFC is in every major city now.  He didn't take a vote on the floor.  This fucking whore.  He just said, a lot of people expressed in private that they didn't want it.  He's a cocksucker, and I think my opinion of Sheldon Silver is that he's tied into these 
[01:38:00]  fucking unions, and it's the cuddle reunion, like Dana said, that's stopping it, because  the fatigestas have a non-union casino in Vegas.  Right.  So, I guess that that means that the UFC shouldn't exist in New York.  Fucking unions.  Now you just look like a complete asshole.  The UFC is everywhere.  And New York is literally one of the only cities that doesn't have it.  It's in Boston.  It's in fucking New Jersey.  It's everywhere.  Vegas.  Red tape.  You look like an idiot.  There's so much corruption in this city and this state. 
[01:38:30]  It makes me so angry that boxing's legal.  Meanwhile, you don't have UFC guys getting punched drunk, because half the fucking fight  is on the floor in their wrestling, and they don't get knocked out most times.  They tap.  Right.  And even the longest fight is only five rounds.  Right.  I cannot stand that fucking Sheldon Silver and the rest of these.  Some guys upstate were killing it, too.  And it's probably because they have their fucking whores.  Yeah, they got their hands into something else.  Yeah, probably because the union backs them.  That's what this is about. 
[01:39:00]  These fucking whores.  So it has nothing to do with the violence.  No.  No.  You're not representing the people.  The people want the UFC in New York.  Period.  Years ago, when it was still a new renegade sport, but Dana changed all that.  He absolutely did.  Dana changed all that.  The early days of the UFC, I couldn't watch, because there was no real tap out.  These guys were fucking...  Oh.  Oh, thank you, Kenny.  We got all the info on pertussis.  Sorry that we're obsessed, but none of us want the whooping cough. 
[01:39:30]  This is from the New York State Board of Health.  Yeah.  What do we got, Kenny?  I don't want to read all this.  Unless you were swapping spit with Anthony, you're not going to get it.  Really?  Really?  Breaking news!  Whoa!  But, Kenny, we're not all out of the woods yet.  Kenny, if I'm on a plane with somebody, if I'm on a plane with somebody and somebody's  got it next to me and he's coughing on me for six hours, you're telling me I can't get it?  You got to get hit with their mucus.  Are you sure?  That's what it says here.  What if the coughing is... 
[01:40:00]  How is pertussis spread?  Yeah, how is pertussis spread?  You tell us.  Pertussis is primarily spread from person to person by direct contact with mucus or droplets  from the nose and throat of infected individuals.  Okay, that's almost like the same way you get a cold and the flu with droplets in the  air.  Yeah.  Basically, it's the same thing.  Yeah, you could push out the droplets and spread it around the room.  Because if Anthony sneezed in his hand and he had the droplets on his hand, you shook  hands on him, hey, have a good weekend.  There you go.  Who shakes hands at Anthony? 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I got to look up what droplets are now.  Droplets could be just sneeze through your nose.  How did you make pertussis sound worse?  I don't know.  This is from the New York Times.  Jim and Jim are here to see you?  Yeah.  What?  What's that about?  That's another story.  What's the story?  The night we met Kenny.  That's the first time we ever met Kenny.  Oh, right, right.  The rascal's West Orange.  Yeah.  And he was being a dick.  A horrible dick.  He's still a dick.  I've known him for, fuck, eight years.  Yeah, but I've come to accept that. 
[01:41:00]  Like, nobody will ever classify me as a great guy.  No.  I've accepted that.  What do you think your problem is?  You can't say I've accepted that and put the ED at the end of.  Wow.  He has Asperger's.  I gave him.  We've been going back and forth every day because, yeah, whatever.  I mean, it was his birthday recently.  Birthday, Kenny.  Did I not get you anything?  I usually give him a little card and a little something.  Nothing too exciting.  And he's been beating the shit out of me over it.  What'd you get? 
[01:41:30]  I apologize.  I didn't give him his birthday card on his birthday, but I said, fuck, I do have something  for you.  He goes, well, you might as well wait till next year.  And then I forgot again.  He goes, why don't you just wait at this point?  It's only 363 days to my birthday.  When was your birthday?  It passed last week.  I was gone.  Okay.  I was away.  And then I finally gave him a card and a little check today.  Nothing big.  And what'd you say to me?  You had more than 100?  Yeah.  More than two?  Whoa.  My wife wanted to give you way more. 
[01:42:00]  There's a check in that card.  I threw it away.  No, you didn't.  You OCD freak.  You did not.  It's a good line.  It's a good joke.  And we're laughing.  But I know you.  You did not.  I was digging through the garbage.  No, you did not.  I know you did.  You didn't rip the card up, because then the check would have been in there.  No, I didn't rip it.  I used to toss it.  I'm like, fuck this.  See?  See?  What'd you say to me when I gave you the card this morning?  I'll save this till next year.  Yeah, I'll open it next year.  It's like, why did I even bother? 
[01:42:30]  Well, people don't realize that Kenny lives to bring any conversation to a screeching halt,  whether it's on the air or off the air.  It's fucking annoying, right?  He's just trying to be funny.  I don't think he's, I think he's a good guy.  He's not a dick.  He's a hard one to figure out.  Because he's, well, look, he was a cop in Newark.  Okay?  So, just shit that he saw for 20 years.  So, he got a great entrepreneur.  Yeah.  You just got to go with his vibe.  Like, it's hard to.  Kenny is, Kenny is the bedside manner of a truck. 
[01:43:00]  Kenny is a facts guy.  Like, he'll always give you facts.  He's very honest.  He's very trustworthy.  He, but he doesn't, not, sugarcoating is, you can't say Kenny is sugarcoated.  He literally doesn't even ask you to open your mouth.  He just takes the spoon with the medicine and shoves it in between your closed teeth.  I have no emotional intelligence.  Yeah.  That's right.  Or other kind.  Yeah.  You want me to just take the check back because I missed the birthday? 
[01:43:30]  You know, it's funny.  Like, on the cover of Meet the Creeps that we all did.  Yep.  Yeah.  And there's, like, my picture.  And there's, like, a little caption that's supposed to describe me.  At the end of a previous life, they held that against me.  What do you mean?  Because, you know, it's just, like, Club Soda County defective thought process.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  It was, like, just, like, all these, like, goof things. 
[01:44:00]  That was held against me.  All right.  So, can I have my check back?  Nobody's getting sick, either.  The guy was here for two weeks sick.  We would have all been sick.  I'm sick.  Jimmy's sick.  Oh, no.  That's a whole different story.  I'll pop lock if you want.  You're run down because of, like, stress and all the hard work you did.  You don't sleep.  Yeah, but what about Jimmy?  I don't sleep good.  And what about Roland?  He's got the star of something.  Exactly.  Roland's probably also run down because Roland doesn't sleep, either. 
[01:44:30]  Rest is very important.  Very.  Well, I'm trying to rest and my fucking apnea machine hurt my throat.  What the fuck, man?  The healthiest person in here is Florentine.  He's, like, an all-natural guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, all-natural.  What does that mean?  Really?  No, he eats good.  He, like, takes vitamins.  He, like, watches things.  He works out.  That's true.  Jim does take vitamins every day, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It's good for you, right?  15 vitamins a day.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Should I do that?  Oh, you do the vitamin packets? 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  They get to be annoying as fuck.  Not the packets.  I got this separate little thing to take.  Yeah.  He lives a good life on a full stomach?  Yeah, but either or it doesn't really matter.  You don't get sick?  He's an animal.  No.  He just swallows that shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He lives a good lifestyle.  Do you take them all at once?  Well, you got it with the traveling and stuff and bringing shit home and no sleep and different  time zones.  Yeah, he takes care of himself.  Do you take it all at once or do you spread it out?  You take it all at once.  Oh, okay.  Godfrey used to spread it out all day.  I'll take it.  You could do that too, but I don't know.  I don't have time.  You spend your morning swallowing fucking horse pills. 
[01:45:30]  I was on that vitamin regimen.  I should do that.  It's a pain in the ass.  Kenny, I didn't catch whether or not...  I do juice drinks instead.  Can I have a vitamin?  I do that too.  Yes, you can have a vitamin.  Do you approve of Florentine's lifestyle, Kenny?  I didn't catch whether or not you thought it was a good thing.  No, no.  We should all emulate Jim Florentine.  Why?  We're not going to do that.  No, he's somebody that can genuinely say,  Jim Florentine's a terrific guy.  Yeah.  He never says that. 
[01:46:00]  He really likes you.  He wants me to invite him to my wedding.  That's why you're saying that.  You getting married?  Yeah.  Did he announce that?  Yeah.  On our show?  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah, we're getting like two months.  Nice.  Yeah, see, he's honorable too.  I don't know if he told us that.  He's going to marry his sweetheart.  I met her.  She's hot stuff.  She's a very attractive girl.  Yeah.  Do you think he'll treat her well? 
[01:46:30]  Florentine's a gentleman.  Do you know how he proposed?  No.  Maybe he doesn't want people to know that.  Tell him.  Okay.  I want to know.  Because I am a gentleman.  And I got class.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He likes to get his asshole fingered when he's having sexual relations.  So he put his engagement ring in his butt cheeks.  And he told his girlfriend, go ahead, finger my ass.  And then the ring just magically popped on.  That's beautiful. 
[01:47:00]  That is wonderful.  That should be a Hallmark card or something.  Yeah.  Same way he gave me my watch.  No, I wanted to do it that way.  I didn't do it that way.  I actually put the ring in a diaper.  My son's diaper.  Really?  Yeah, in front of the whole family.  Was there duty in the diaper?  No, but she thought that was.  Because he just took a huge shit.  Right.  Right before it was on Christmas Eve.  But everyone was over.  And everyone was having hors d'oeuvres.  And drinking wine.  And dressed up.  Nice.  And right in the living room I brought it out.  Nice.  I told her she needed to open it.  Because there's blood in his shit. 
[01:47:30]  That's how you got for the ring?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's blood in your baby's shit?  Yeah.  You want to tell the world he's romantic, Kenny?  Well, because he just took a shit that like three people.  We needed three people to clean them.  It was that bad.  Like right in the living room.  Because we had the changing bed right in the living room.  So everyone's like, all right, whatever.  So we just dumped it all out.  Were you cleaning them?  Yeah, I was helping.  Yeah.  So then I went back over.  And I'm like, oh, he's doing it again.  And then she came in with a tray of hors d'oeuvres and wine.  And I go, honey, you better check this diaper out.  There's something wrong.  She's like, what do you? 
[01:48:00]  I go, open it.  There's blood in it now.  And she's like, you want me to open this diaper right in the living room on Christmas Eve?  I'm like, yeah, we've got to do something.  She's like, you've got to be kidding me.  I go, just open it, will you?  Yelling at her.  And she opened it.  And the ring was in there.  And what did she say?  Was she like disappointed that it wasn't shit with blood in it?  No, she was just, you know, she started crying and stuff.  But her brother was there.  And he goes, I was going to beat the shit out of you.  Seriously.  Like if that went on for more than 10 more seconds.  He didn't know.  He had no one knew except for my brother, Dan.  He was the only one.  Did you wash the ring after you took it out of the diaper? 
[01:48:30]  No, it was a clean diaper.  It wasn't a shit diaper, but she thought it was.  Fair enough.  It was perfect timing.  How great would it have been if your kid just shit right after you put the ring in there?  Well.  And you didn't know that.  And now it is a ring in your kid's shit.  You never know.  Well, no, it was a clean diaper.  And I took it.  You know, they said I just walked over with it.  It wasn't on him.  Yeah, the diaper wasn't on the child.  It wasn't on him.  I took one out.  Oh, that's boring.  Yeah.  I would have put it on the fucking kid.  I would have taken a chance that he might have shit. 
[01:49:00]  No, the kid wasn't in on the prank.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, he was too young.  Yeah, he's just a kid.  My piss on the ring.  All right, I got it now.  That's actually cool.  When are you exactly getting married?  Two weeks.  In the middle of July.  Two months.  Yeah, soon.  First Sam gets married.  I got the dates.  I'm going.  All right, very good.  So no UFC because this stupid state is corrupt.  It makes me...  How do people not...  The stupid guy in our government doesn't represent.  Doesn't represent the people because the people absolutely want the UFC in New York.  New York City would be very nice.  All those tax dollars. 
[01:49:30]  Madison Square Garden.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Of course we all want it.  If you're into sports, you want the UFC in New York.  What a piece of shit that Sheldon Silver is.  It will not come to the floor this year, Silver told the Daily News.  They don't let it come to the floor.  They don't even allow a vote, huh?  That's how they do it.  The conference, he said, was pretty evenly divided.  Silver didn't rule out passage in the next year or two.  I think it's evolving, he said.  I don't think two years ago it was a 50-50 proposition. 
[01:50:00]  One of the guys did express disappointment at the decision.  This is legal in most states.  It's highly regulated and it generates economic activities for small business and creates much-needed revenue for the state.  So there's a guy with a fucking normal head that understands shit.  But there's obviously fucking backroom deals going on that Silver wants to protect.  I bet it's all that union shit.  You have to take that.  All those fucking union guys because of Vegas.  Right.  Then you had another Democratic Assembly woman. 
[01:50:30]  Nice.  Self-proclaimed fan of the controversial sport.  Dismissed talk of the violence played up by the detractors.  Mixed martial arts is an art form, she said.  I don't believe there is inherent violence in it.  I don't either.  Karate is legal and boxing is legal.  To combine them, it's not legal.  Right.  It's fucking sickening and it's bullshit.  It is bullshit.  Fucking Dana White's got to be out of his mind.  And it's way less corrupt than boxing.  It's way less corrupt than fucking boxing. 
[01:51:00]  Of course.  The way the people, the boxing promoters and shit behave.  And the amount of shit that has gone on in boxing.  And it's perfectly legal.  What fucking frauds these assembly people are.  What fucking frauds.  And that's why I hate them all.  Sickening.  Not a fan of any of these fucking guys.  I don't trust any of them.  Not a one.  Not a one.  New York just is humiliated and looks like assholes. 
[01:51:30]  Because the whole fucking world is watching this sport.  Even how many states is it banned from?  Two or three or four.  That's it.  Yeah.  And New York's the biggest one.  Of course.  Oh my God.  By far.  Also the most red tape in New York.  It might be four or five.  But in most places.  Even Fox Sports embraced it.  What is it on Fox?  It's on Fox.  It's on Fox what?  Every month at this point?  Something like that?  Yeah.  It's a Fox Sport.  But not legal in New York.  And Fox Sports had to think long and hard about this.  And they finally embraced it and said, of course we should be doing this.  You think it has something to do with the boxing community? 
[01:52:00]  All the ties?  Trying to keep it down in New York?  Well, Dana thinks it says it was the unions.  It's the cuddle reunion.  Because the Fatistas who are the owners with Dana, I think they might even be higher partners  than him.  I'm not sure.  Or maybe they're even.  Have a non-union casino in Vegas.  So the cuddle reunion here is very powerful.  Of course.  Maybe we're going to hold back our votes or whatever the fuck they do.  And, you know, you're a union guy.  And I just had to deal with it. 
[01:52:30]  I'm really annoyed at unions right now because of what I dealt with in Cleveland.  That fucking cocksucker union rep.  And I get unions to do a lot of good, man.  Believe me.  I don't want to hear from you.  I know that what you represent is needed.  But fucking assholes.  All right.  What does that got to do with anything?  After dealing...  Let me tell you something.  After what I just went through in Cleveland, I would love to do my next special.  In a fucking work...  What is it?  A free...  A right to work state?  Where you don't have to be union? 
[01:53:00]  I would love to fucking shoot in a non-union building.  So that guy rooted for all unions?  It was just...  When you get union guys who are really good at what they do.  And who are trained and who are competent.  They're great.  And they make your shoot and everything you're doing go very smoothly.  And they earn their money.  For real.  But when you get scumbags like that.  And there's way too many of them protected in unions.  I'm just like, fuck you.  I don't want to...  I don't want to be involved with the union. 
[01:53:30]  I don't want to.  I want to fucking do a non-union shoot.  Because I'm not going to get fucked.  It annoys me.  So we pick that building to shoot in.  We bring a special there.  And the guy is such a fucking cocksucker.  Doesn't give a fuck about the shoot.  What's happening.  They're going to get my guy down.  I watched him say it.  Big fucking union rep.  Really.  Big shot in Cleveland.  What?  To do stuff for the stage or all that stuff?  Or lights?  Yeah, but the guy...  Well, things weren't worked out yet.  The cues weren't being worked out. 
[01:54:00]  So Jimmy needed a little more time.  And you couldn't be on the stage for a couple hours?  Our guy asked for five more minutes.  I heard him go, can we just have five minutes?  And half the fucking cues that don't get done, hey, it's all your union guys that are working on this.  It's not just the production people.  So there's just not an ounce of give with these motherfuckers.  And that's what...  Look, you've got to make your living.  And if we're trying to take 15 to 20 minutes, then you've got to...  Of course.  Right.  But just watching this scumbag.  Like when he goes, look, we have five minutes. 
[01:54:30]  He goes, hey, I've got to start the clock at seven guys, timing it, whatever he was saying.  And I was just like, what a fucking jerk-off.  What a jerk-off.  Ugh.  And then I hear this shit.  Really?  What, the UFC shit?  That's what I hear it is.  I don't know, but that's what I hear.  It's ridiculous.  It's been ridiculous for years.  But at this point, you're embarrassing yourself.  You're showing that it's some kind of fucking corruption going on. 
[01:55:00]  Or, like I said, backroom deals.  New York is ridiculous.  It's just, it's embarrassing.  It's an embarrassing city and an embarrassing state that they can't get this past.  And New York City's broke, which amazes me.  And you've got something like this that would absolutely generate money immediately?  Why doesn't the mayor, I mean, we know why she doesn't fight for it, but why doesn't the mayor stand up and say this is a totally legitimate sport?  Or how about this?  If you want to be fair-handed, how about you get rid of boxing then?  UFC doesn't have one one-hundredth of the fucking corruption that boxing has had. 
[01:55:30]  Doesn't have one one-hundredth of the fucking, of the fucking organized crime influence or any of that shit.  The fight fixing, all the stuff that has historically happened in boxing.  UFC doesn't have that.  And even now, what's coming out with the concussions, you know, these guys getting pounded in the head.  In boxing?  Yeah, I mean, but look what's going on with the football players.  So, I mean, if you're that concerned with boxing, it's the guys that are punch drunk, that can't remember anything. 
[01:56:00]  These guys are getting concussions every fight.  They have to be.  Hockey player takes one blow, or like you said, football, and they're getting concussions.  These boxers, they have to be getting really fucked up every fight.  It's just a lie.  It's just a lie.  They're just, the assembly people are simply lying.  They have, they're just, they're whores for the people that are financing them.  People are asking why you support Obama. 
[01:56:30]  Because I.  All in Texas, actually.  Paul wants to know why I support Obama.  Ron Paul is who I really support.  I like Ron Paul the best.  Because I thought Gingrich was a cunt.  Santorum was a cunt.  And I just don't like Romney.  I don't hate him, but I just don't like him.  I think Obama cares more about regular people than Mitt Romney does.  That's my opinion.  Not too far off there.  No.  I don't care about either guy.  I'm not saying, I, I, I'm not saying people can't hate Obama for his taxes. 
[01:57:00]  But it's funny when people are like, he's anti-American.  You fucking cock.  The guy wants to get health care for people.  Like, I kind of respect that, even if I don't agree with his methods.  I like the idea that somebody wants to get health care for broke people.  Well, it would be nice if he could have him.  Yeah, but then you also get, you also get fine.  If you don't have it.  I mean, we were comics for the first 10 years when we were doing comedy.  We didn't have health insurance.  And there's no way we could pay a fine if we didn't have it.  Right.  The methods, I don't, I don't agree with.  I'm not saying there's methods are right.  But then there's a weird thing.  Like, I don't think you should be forced to, to opt in at all. 
[01:57:30]  But then you, then I think that we as a country have the right to go, okay, but if you get  hurt, nothing.  You get not, like, it's a weird thing.  It's almost like, uh, we should have no foreign interference.  But man, if, if something happens, our response will be horrible.  Same thing with healthcare.  Opt in.  But if you don't opt in, fuck you.  Right.  Go to the hospital and fucking tough it out.  And they're no longer legally required to treat you. 
[01:58:00]  Like, you know what I mean?  It should be that harsh if you don't want to fucking.  Yeah, of course.  If you want the rest of us to pay for it.  I'm babbling.  I'm sorry.  I'm tired.  You're not babbling.  You made a good point there.  But yeah, there's a lot, I'm not saying that his methods are all right.  I just like the motive of wanting.  You put Kenny asleep.  You put Kenny asleep.  That's fair enough.  But besides that, I think you made a good point.  You all right, Kenny?  Yeah, I'm relaxing.  It's just a mess in here.  But good news, we don't have pertussis unless droplets got on us.  Right, Kenny?  Yeah. 
[01:58:30]  Unless you were swapping spirits.  Well, because now Cleveland is yelling at me.  The entire city.  They're like, does that mean Ant got all of us sick?  Maybe one of them got Anthony sick.  Yeah.  How about that, Cleveland?  How about that?  I think so.  That city's like I Am Legend.  Huh?  That city's like I Am Legend.  You don't see people during the day.  That's how the viruses start.  They're hiding.  Maybe.  They come out like little zombies and cough on people, and then everyone gets sick.  And then they spread it to the rest of America. 
[01:59:00]  How come you don't think you're a terrific guy?  Why don't we take a vote?  Everybody knows.  I think you're terrific.  Does your wife think you're terrific?  I'm just a wallet to her.  I thought for many years that Kenny was very caring, and then I realized it's just OCD.  How did he?  I realized it's just OCD, and he has to like, you know, A before B, and then C. 
[01:59:30]  Like, today he was so stressed out because he called Jimmy at 531 instead of 530.  Yeah, the bottom line is just pay me.  How stressed out were you today?  You were out of your mind.  Yeah, the coffee wasn't ready for you.  See, because every...  No, but he doesn't care that...  No, it's all details.  It's all details.  It's not...  There's no caring involved.  He could be just as easily making your funeral arrangements as he is as getting the coffee.  Kenny's very...  Kenny's very fucking detail-oriented.  Kenny pulls up to my building, because I've watched this, I mean, to the second every day. 
[02:00:00]  It has to be at an exact time.  He's a slave to that stuff.  And then the coffee has to be right, and the water has to be right.  And then on the way, if me and him are chit-chatting or something gets fucked up, and he looks down, and it's 531, he's out of his mind.  Because he's supposed to call Jimmy at 530, and then he's supposed to call Jimmy either five minutes later or ten minutes later.  And that's got to be fucking perfect.  Well, look, that's his job, to be in a routine, so I get it. 
[02:00:30]  And then sometimes I go, Kenny, there's nowhere to park in front of the building, so why don't you park the car?  He goes, are you sure?  But it's not like, are you sure that you're going to be inconvenienced?  He can't wrap his head around the fact that he doesn't park the car for a little while, then go upstairs, then wait for Anthony, then come back, then ask me what I want for breakfast.  Then he goes down and parks the car.  It's the exact same routine every fucking day.  And are you sure?  To the second.  That response, by the way, pops into his head. 
[02:01:00]  Like, you ever see the Terminator?  When all those responses just file past him with computer sounds?  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck you, asshole.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the same way.  Are you sure?  And if you knock him off that routine, he is out of his mind.  So it's not caring.  It's OCD, which makes me sad, because I thought we had a relationship.  But he proved it today when he didn't accept my card nicely.  You shouldn't even pay this much attention to me.  Did you have a nice dinner with your wife on Sunday?  For your birthday?  Yeah, I called into the Sam Roberts show, because they were talking about marriage. 
[02:01:30]  What did you say?  There was a lot of haters, like, you know, telling Sam, don't get married.  And I just had a call and explain, like, you know, his wife is a hot piece of ass, so  he should marry her as long as he can give it to her real good.  That's not what...  That's the way he should give it to her, Sam.  They'll sustain their marriage.  Give it to her good.  Thank you, Chip.  But that's not what Kenny said.  I got it, Chip.  No, that's what I meant.  You get it good and wet, Sammy?  I got it, Chip.  Spit on it if you have to. 
[02:02:00]  You're an idiot.  No.  Fucking shit, get that cuda soaking.  Disgusting.  Fucking climb right on, fucking fill that cuda.  Kenny said that he was...  Fucking heard it.  ...in the car with his wife and that they were going to a nice dinner out.  And that he was very happily married still to this day.  Fucking lick it.  Correct.  When she was in the car?  Yeah.  All right, so...  Yeah.  But let me...  Now I see where that's coming from.  I didn't ask too many questions.  Yeah.  Let me guess, you went for steak.  Yes. 
[02:02:30]  Of course you did.  Give, um...  Give my steak?  Yes.  You ever eat at Del Frisco's?  No.  It's on my bucket list.  It's just a restaurant.  Yeah.  A bucket list is supposed to be like crazy shit.  Yeah, not a place that's next door from where you work.  Right.  We literally broadcast above it.  That should be on your bucket list.  Going to France should be on a bucket list.  Going in on, I don't know, a hot air balloon, a bungee cord jumping, that type of shit.  Del Frisco's should be something you do Wednesday.  Yeah, swimming with the sharks, maybe. 
[02:03:00]  I don't know.  Hiking in the Grand Canyon.  Not a restaurant that's downstairs.  I'll take you to Del Frisco's.  What else is on your bucket list?  Get a bucket.  He doesn't know.  He doesn't know how to relax or enjoy himself.  He doesn't have an iPod.  You don't have an iPod so you can listen to music?  You like the disco music.  You should get an iPod.  Yeah, well, I have a satellite radio.  Did you at least treat yourself for your birthday?  Get a little cakey thing? 
[02:03:30]  Well, I...  With a little candle, maybe?  First of all, I went because this particular place that we go to, that we like, I'm a preferred customer.  No, you like it and you bring everyone there.  No, other people like it.  You sure?  Yeah.  They don't like it every time, though.  Where is it?  You know where it is.  It's a steak place.  Oh, it's very good.  Yeah.  So since I'm a preferred customer, they sent me a $100 gift card for my birthday. 
[02:04:00]  I hate when we're out and something goes wrong and Kenny will say in front of other people,  I'm a preferred customer.  Really?  Yes.  It's the worst.  You know, he goes to the same diner.  I don't know which day of the week it is, but he goes every whatever it is,  it's Tuesday, and he gets the exact same special.  That's his whole life.  Yeah.  He drops you off and then he goes to the gymnasium.  I swear, I'm not sure if he...  He might be a robot.  Yeah.  Because he does everything exactly the same every day. 
[02:04:30]  What's the special that you get?  Hot open roast beef sandwich.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What do you have to drink?  A lemonade, like a five-year-old.  And what is it?  It's their specialty?  And that's why I got it?  Yeah, every Wednesday.  No, not their special.  It's their special, like, on the menu.  Like, that's the special price.  Jesus.  Because you get the sandwich and a side and a drink for...  Yeah.  But I want to know if you treated yourself for your birthday, because you rarely do.  You say every once in a while you have a cookie, I think? 
[02:05:00]  Well, this particular restaurant, they gave me a $100 gift card for my birthday.  And a lava cake, maybe?  Well, they have what they call the steak and seafood special.  Yeah.  Which is actually, like, almost half price.  And it comes with, like, salad, steak, seafood, potato, vegetable, and a dessert.  All included.  Did you have your dessert?  Yeah.  What was it?  The hot chocolate cake. 
[02:05:30]  Lava cake?  The hot chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.  And you only ate that because it was your birthday, right?  Yeah.  And because it was part of the special.  Yeah, exactly.  Because it came with it.  Wait, so he's a special guy, you think?  Yeah, he loves getting the special.  You love specials?  And he can't.  He has to eat every part of the special.  Like, he wouldn't get dessert, but he's going to get the special.  And if the special comes with dessert, he's got to eat it.  You have to eat it.  Why is that?  Well, you know what me and Sam did when we bought our bottled soda and brought it into the bar?  Yes.  Yeah.  In Cleveland at this hotel.  It's much less expensive. 
[02:06:00]  They wanted to save money, so they went into the gift shop and got their own Dr. Peppers  and then sat at the bar and forced the waitress to get them glasses of ice.  Instead of paying for it at the bar.  Right.  And we went in the gift shop, and we hand the lady two bottles of Dr. Pepper.  And the lady goes, that'll be $4.  And Kenny goes, each?  And she goes, no, together.  And he yells, wow, that's a good price.  And then he went into the hotel bar with them and asked the barkeep for two large glasses of ice. 
[02:06:30]  Did he call a barkeep?  I don't remember.  We were in the fucking pharmacy, and I was looking for, like, whatever it was.  The first thing, what did you call him the first thing?  Doctor?  Yeah.  Then he goes, doctor.  And the pharmacist comes over.  And then a minute later, I need something else.  And Kenny goes, excuse me, medic.  Calls the guy, I'm medic.  Well, I heard some story, when you guys check in the hotel, he's like, hey, can we get two rooms?  Because people think we're queers or something.  Kenny said that a couple times ago. 
[02:07:00]  Kenny will say, like, on the elevator, we have separate rooms.  And the person will go, okay, because people think we're a couple of queers.  That's just the strangers.  That's very funny.  That's why it's so much fun to hang with him.  Oh, I know.  Because he has no filter.  No.  It's so bizarre.  What's next on your routine today?  Everything good?  I just have to kill time until 10 o'clock.  Oh, you're good now?  Yeah.  When I leave to use the restroom or something, and I'm coming back in the studio,  Kenny, every time, he's so bored out there, he goes, 
[02:07:30]  what are you going back in there for?  Stay out here.  Because he kills time.  You just want to talk to somebody?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, nobody will talk to me.  Because there's a gap in the routine.  He can't actually do anything, because there's nothing scheduled.  But then now do you shit the same time every day, too?  Is that a routine?  But you have a spastic colon, though, right?  Yeah, I live my life through my asshole.  So you can't...  That's how you do radio, too.  Yeah.  Do you shit at work?  Yeah.  If I got to go, I go.  Yeah, I fucking shit wherever. 
[02:08:00]  So you can't control that?  Oh, no.  I go.  You go, you go.  So that fucks up your routine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the unpredictable part of his life.  That takes precedence overall.  He doesn't like unpredictability.  Were you ever in the middle of shitting, and you had to call Jim to wake him up, and it fucked you up?  Yeah, if I had to, I would.  Or pick up Opie.  You ever late because you had to shit?  It's rare, Jim.  It's rare.  Yeah.  He doesn't even want an iPod.  I think...  Huh?  I do.  I have taken shits in his building. 
[02:08:30]  You have?  What?  In the lobby?  Yeah.  Yeah, the lobby bathroom.  Yeah.  Why don't you get an iPod?  Why don't you get something you can enjoy?  It costs money.  Then you got to download songs.  Right.  You do all that for your enjoyment, though.  There's an enjoyment factor.  And you would sleep on planes about it because you wouldn't hear kids cry.  I'm sure there's a lot of music you would like, and we could get music for free around here.  We burn that shit illegally.  I don't.  I don't do anything illegal.  You get some disco stuff?  Yeah, you get a little disco action for your iPod. 
[02:09:00]  It's all right.  What do you do for fun?  Were you romantic that night, or your birthday, you and your wife?  Like, did you say nice things at the table?  Did you hold hands?  Fondle each other's genitals under the table?  No.  Were you romantic?  No, the lights are on.  There's people around.  That's why you go under the table.  You never looked her in the eye and said nice things to her that night when you guys were eating at your favorite restaurant?  What was the conversation? 
[02:09:30]  And it was your birthday.  For your birthday.  I just ordered.  Oh, my God.  It seemed like things were going to get romantic.  He's not even kidding, though.  Really?  Because when he called into the show, he was, like, really complimenting and talking up his wife and how great their relationship was.  Look at the sweat coming off your head.  It's hot under these lights.  You've got all these lights.  On a scale of one to ten, how romantic would you say you are, ten being the most romantic?  Be serious.  A three. 
[02:10:00]  Three's not bad.  That's not bad.  How about affection?  Affection.  One.  Yeah, one.  Zero to one.  How about encouraging remarks?  Oh, that I'm good at.  Okay.  He might be, actually.  When they're deserved.  So maybe like a five?  Yeah.  I give a lot of positive affirmations.  But you won't just dish out well wishes willy-nilly if they're not deserved.  No, they've got to be deserved.  Yeah.  Or else they don't mean anything.  Right.  What do you do for fun? 
[02:10:30]  I know you go to the gym a lot, but besides that, and doing a lot of paperwork all the  time, what do you do?  You do a lot of paperwork.  Well, I'm running a business.  I can't tell you how many times I go, so Kenny, what's your plans this weekend?  And he goes, paperwork.  Lots of paperwork to catch up.  Kenny loves paperwork because it's manageable.  I don't even look at his paperwork because he has to paperwork all us.  I just trust him.  He itemizes everything. 
[02:11:00]  Did he get you anything today?  No.  Oh, Roland.  Roland.  He itemizes everything.  Yeah, you're lucky.  I'm going to bring in your next report and read through it.  It's amazing.  All right.  Handling fees on a cup of coffee.  Really?  Well, I don't get paid well, so I have to nickel and dime you people.  He's nickel and dime everybody.  I don't care.  It's funny.  There's a handling fee on a Starbucks.  What's the handling fee on a cup of coffee? 
[02:11:30]  I don't even know.  I don't like that closely.  Oh.  You go monthly with that?  Yeah.  You don't go percentage by item?  No, it's monthly.  It was just easier that way because probably you want to save on the paper.  Now, what happens when they're off for a week?  You can't nickel and dime us.  Yeah.  He's down a few pennies.  So the handling fee goes down for the month.  Exactly.  Oh, so that's why you're trying to convince everybody that nobody's sick because you don't want them  to cancel the show for six weeks.  Yeah, you can't handle not getting those handling fees out there.  You want to keep everybody healthy around here. 
[02:12:00]  It's six weeks with no handling fees.  What are you going to do for six weeks?  Oh, fuck.  Are you kidding me?  I don't work.  I don't get paid.  I have no benefits.  Oh, great.  That's officially the first call.  Oh, Jesus.  I got it, too.  But wouldn't you like to have more time to spend with your hobbies?  What, like going to Governor's this weekend to see Jim Florentine? 
[02:12:30]  See, he doesn't have hobbies, huh?  He works out.  He goes to the gym.  That's about it, though.  So, what do you like to watch on television these days?  Well, I don't have much time to watch television, but...  Because of the paperwork.  Of course.  I'm serious.  Because you can't watch television and do paperwork.  No, not him.  Nope.  Police shows.  Of course.  Police shows.  Aren't you sick of police shows at this point?  Or want to let it go?  What am I going to watch?  True Housewives of New Jersey? 
[02:13:00]  I watched that.  That Teresa's fucked up.  Oh, my God.  My wife, that's all she has on.  She's crazy and she doesn't even know it.  She doesn't even know how fucked up she is.  Yeah, well, she's really going to be worse now because she's on Celebrity Apprentice,  so she's going to think she's a celebrity.  You know how you know those Housewife shows are all scripted?  Every time those Housewife shows are on Apprentice, they're completely boring.  Really?  Yeah.  Teresa sucks on Apprentice?  She does nothing.  She got fired on Sunday.  Oh, really?  Did Donald go, you're fired?  That's right.  Yes, he did. 
[02:13:30]  Did you see it?  I can imagine.  Oh.  All right, Kenny.  How, in the bed, fucking wise, on a scale of one to ten, how good are you, would you say?  If you had to rate yourself.  If I put effort into it?  Yeah.  If I put effort into it.  Now, wait, why, before you even get, why wouldn't you put effort into it?  No, why would I?  All right, so if you do, if you do put effort into it.  Like, it's inevitable that cum is coming out of my prick, eventually. 
[02:14:00]  Right.  Jeez.  Sooner than later.  Okay.  You know.  Do you just climb on?  Yeah, it's like, you know.  But do you ever hold back, because maybe for her enjoyment?  Like, you feel it cum, and you're like, well, I don't want to do it too soon, because she's enjoying the moment.  I gotta get to bed.  Everything.  I wonder if it's like six at night.  No, everything is time.  I know, that's what it is.  He probably allots some time for sex. 
[02:14:30]  But if it's not in that period, there's no way it's happening.  How often does it happen?  Once a month.  Exactly once a month?  Maybe, if I'm lucky.  Is there a day?  Do you have a sex day?  No.  Could you, you usually do it at night, when you do it?  No.  Morning, or something, or afternoon?  Yeah, like, whenever.  Whenever I can get it in, I'll stick it in.  How long do you think you can last?  Like, how's the, what's the longest you've lasted, in like, the last ten years? 
[02:15:00]  Or the longest you've chosen to last.  Yeah.  Can you last more than ten minutes?  But that's time, too.  No.  No?  You see the one you did?  No.  Six minutes?  Maybe.  Maybe.  Be like a five-minute bang guy?  Probably.  Is there a lot of foreplay?  You're a quick shooter?  Have you been a quick shooter your whole life? 
[02:15:30]  Yeah, I would.  Yeah, I would.  No, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, is there a lot of foreplay?  Negative.  No kissing a neck, or anything like that?  No, that would, you know, insinuate that, like, I cared.  When's the last time you made out with your wife?  Why don't you, like, show an emotion? 
[02:16:00]  I'm emotionally unavailable.  When was the last time you made out?  That's a fair question.  Um, I don't know.  Months ago.  That's not so bad.  I don't know.  But you don't, how do you initiate sexual intercourse?  You just say, hey.  Let's do this.  Let's do, you want to fuck?  Nah, it's more like you just rip the panties off like a rapist.  I don't believe that.  Must go through a lot of panties.  I don't, I don't tear them. 
[02:16:30]  I gently.  Do you talk dirty?  Because he doesn't want to have to buy new panties.  Right.  No, I don't say anything.  It's not in the budget.  No.  You don't talk dirty?  I don't say anything.  You don't say anything.  How about in the middle of fucking, do you ever say anything?  Like, oh, this is good.  Oh, you, this feels so good.  Nothing.  I usually say, like, I hope you're not fucking anybody else.  It's just the worst. 
[02:17:00]  Stop fucking other people.  Do you have a tight budget at home?  Oh, no, no, no.  My family likes to live well, no matter who pays for it.  He's got a line for everything.  All right.  Well, we still don't know Kenny.  We tried.  You think he's packing?  No.  No.  No?  No.  No.  No, just in the sense of next to your large frame, no, or no for anyone? 
[02:17:30]  Like, you know what I mean?  Like, maybe it's average for a guy who's slight of frame, but with your frame.  No, it's nothing to speak about.  I think he's got at least seven.  Yeah?  Got a seven?  Solid seven.  Seven looks small on his six foot frame.  No, but he knows it's pretty big, but he's...  Six five?  How tall are you?  I don't even know.  I wish.  I think Kenny's about a six guy, or five and three quarter guy.  You think so?  Five and three quarter?  Yeah.  So probably looks small on his body.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, you think? 
[02:18:00]  I've never seen it, but I think.  Yeah, one time when my wife got mad at me, and my son was a teenager, and she was mad at  me, so she wanted to hurt my family.  Oh, don't even...  And she goes, and your son even has a bigger dick than you.  Really?  Yeah.  She didn't say that in front of your son, and she didn't say it on the radio. 
[02:18:30]  No, she didn't say it when he was there.  Oh, no, no.  And what did you say?  Was that hurtful?  I just took my medicine.  What was your medicine?  No, like, she was yelling at me, and she wanted to hurt my feelings.  Did it hurt your feelings?  It doesn't have feelings.  No, I was happy for him.  I was just saying.  He doesn't have feelings.  I was happy for him.  He doesn't have feelings.  He's right.  That's more of that positive feedback.  Right. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  No, good for him.  My mother never said that.  What did she say?  Why don't we do an activity?  She has a little dingle.  Dingle?  Yeah, she would say that.  A little white one.  Her and her friend would point and laugh at me.  Who was her friend?  Lamar.  What would Lamar do?  I don't know.  He'd come over and help fix the floors.  Go ahead.  Talk to Kenny.  You should do an activity with Kenny. 
[02:19:30]  What would you like to do, Kenny?  Skydive?  He won't watch a scary movie.  He doesn't watch scary movies?  No way.  Why?  The last scary movie I got from Jim was I Am Legend.  It's not that scary.  It's scary at all.  They get way scarier.  It's a Will Smith movie.  There's monsters in that movie.  And it scared you?  Yeah.  What happens when you're scared?  He runs through the front door, leaves the imprint in himself. 
[02:20:00]  Do you have to sleep with the lights on or anything?  No.  You never saw any of the horror films, the classics?  Exorcist?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I saw The Exorcist when I was 17 in a drive-in.  And then when I went home, I used to keep a bat in my truck.  And I walked from my truck to my front door with my bat.  In case you got what?  Possessed?  You had a bat in your hand?  I was scared.  Against the devil? 
[02:20:30]  I got a bat.  Satan.  Protecting himself from the devil?  That wouldn't work.  I was better than nothing.  Did you text your chainsaw massacre?  Yeah, when I first came out.  And?  I don't like it.  Saw?  No, none of them.  Hostile?  None of them.  Nightmare on Elm Street?  None of them.  The Ring?  None of them.  Friday the 13th?  None of them.  Really?  I got to watch one of these movies with him. 
[02:21:00]  I've been telling him.  Holy fuck, I agree with that, B.  But he won't.  No.  Why?  What is that about?  That's just not my thing.  You get scared?  Yeah, they're scary.  You saw, like, real-life horrific stuff, though.  You'd be committed, real-life.  How could you?  Yeah, the shit you saw.  That would make seeing those movies easy.  Yeah.  What about superhero movies?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've seen them. 
[02:21:30]  What kind of movies did you watch with your wife?  Cop movies.  Like, what's the last movie you and your wife went to?  In the theater?  Oh, we don't go to theaters, because, you know, it's too many.  What?  Too many what?  Too many annoying people.  Oh.  Not really.  Yeah.  There really isn't.  I know, there's not.  Just go on a Sunday morning.  You try to avoid the annoying people whenever you can, don't you?  Yeah.  The last movie I saw with my wife was Bridesmaids.  Were there annoying people in the theater talking? 
[02:22:00]  Oh, no.  It was at home.  I don't go to a movie theater.  When was the last time you went to a movie theater?  Probably when my kids were little.  So, what if your wife wants to go see a movie in the theater?  Then we usually go to, like, a Saturday matinee or something when, you know, no annoying people are around.  All right, that's fair enough.  Do they sleep late?  The guy that yells wherever he is, he's on a plane sitting there, what was that?  And he's talking about, I don't want to be around annoying people. 
[02:22:30]  Careful.  He's the biggest annoyance out there.  I know.  Jesus.  That did happen with Florentine's referring to.  We were on a cross-country plane in one of those Jason Bourne movies we're on.  Yeah.  And, you know, it's like halfway through the flight and everybody's, like, sleeping and relaxing and all mellowed out.  And then there was a part in the movie when, like, somebody was sneaking up behind Jason Bourne to, like, do him harm.  And I screamed out, watch out! 
[02:23:00]  Did everyone jump up?  I don't know.  He doesn't know.  It's embarrassing on a plane, though, when, like, a little bump will happen.  They're like, what was that?  It's so loud.  There you go.  You know, I'm a public nuisance.  Yeah.  I have to piss.  All right, we'll take it later.  We don't, we still don't know you.  It's all right.  Nobody's missing anything.  All right, fair enough.  Florentine's going to be at Governor's Friday.  Yeah.  And then Saturday, he moves over to the other club, which I keep forgetting. 
[02:23:30]  McGuire's.  McGuire's.  Sorry, McGuire's.  And it's Mr. Jim Florentine on Twitter.  We'll continue.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Fuck that.  Jim Florentine in studio helping us out today.  Got Ozzy shot in the dark in the background.  I like this one, Jimmy.  Very big hit off of The Ultimate Sin.  Absolutely.  I do like this, even though it was a commercial hit.  I like it a lot.  That's a great song. 
[02:24:00]  I love it.  What's wrong with commercial hits?  Not my favorite off the album, though.  Killer of Giants is my favorite.  Never heard of it, sir.  Never heard of it.  I love this song, The Ultimate Sin, too.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Even Secret Loser is good.  It's a good record.  Thank God for the bomb.  Huh?  Thank God for the bomb, sure.  That was when Ozzy was going through his early, mid-80s, nuclear war consciousness phase  that every artist went through.  And this is when he did the fucking Bette Midler hairdo.  And he had that weird, long, flowing rose.  He threw doves.  He just did everything in the 80s. 
[02:24:30]  He was worried about the bomb?  Yeah.  Poor Ozzy.  Not so much nowadays?  Now that you care.  What song is this?  Wait.  Secret Loser.  Is this Secret Loser?  Lightning Strikes is a good song, too.  Dillette says this is Thank God for the Bomb.  This is Thank God for the Bomb?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There he's going. 
[02:25:00]  Never heard of this.  Never heard of this before.  I like this, too.  Yeah.  God for the bomb.  I guess the Octomom made her self-pleasuring porn.  Have you watched that?  Yeah, I want to see what her pussy looks like.  I would check it out, too.  But I wouldn't be turned on by it.  I would watch it because it's like a freak show.  What is she doing?  She's making self-pleasuring porn films now, but she's masturbating on film. 
[02:25:30]  Her pussy probably looks like the banner that a football team breaks through when they're  running off to the Super Bowl.  She is going to make it a lot more than the $10,000 she made for posing topless.  So this broad needs money and has decided to go the sex route.  She'll do whole hardcore porn, too.  You think?  Without a doubt, she'll do it.  An Octomom takes fucking octo inches.  You know, some dumb shit.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Octomom takes octo.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true. 
[02:26:00]  So where do we get to see this?  We got to pay for it?  I want to get a screen grab of her puss.  Well, did she have the kids naturally?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'll just have to see what a fucking horror show that is.  I don't know anything about the Octomom.  I don't care.  I don't care to know anything.  So.  What else is going on, Jim Florentine?  What is going on?  Anything in your world?  Me and Sherrod Small hosting a show on YouTube. 
[02:26:30]  What are you doing?  It's called The Full Hoon.  This car and driver magazine has a new YouTube channel.  Right.  So they have a bunch of different programming, like six different shows.  Me and him host a show called The Full Hoon.  And a new show premieres, like, every Monday.  It's like a ten-minute clip.  It's just car clip commercials of car clips, funny car clips, and we just make fun of them.  Oh, that's cool.  Is it getting views?  I think so, yeah.  It's only, like, ten-minute shows.  We just, you know, make a clip.  We just talk over it.  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah, so you can get it at youtube.com slash car and driver. 
[02:27:00]  You can sign up.  It's called The Full Hoon.  Okay.  Jimmy, how's the cough?  It's okay.  I'm not worried, though, dude, to be honest with you.  I don't really care how sick I get because I wasn't sick last week, and I wasn't sick  when I shot at the Renaissance Fair, so I'm okay.  I'm all good, man.  Yeah.  I don't want to be sick, but I'd rather be sick here than I'm fucking doing stand-up  because, you know, that would just be a disaster.  Yeah, you need your air.  Fuck yeah, man.  My throat hurts though. 
[02:27:30]  I'm so fucking mad that I...  Ugh.  Forget it.  Can't use the apnea mask, cocksucker.  Why not?  Because it's fucking hurting my throat.  It's annoying.  You probably just didn't have the right amount of water in it or something like that.  No, the water was fine, dude.  I don't know what it is.  It's probably just...  Well, it's the first night you used it.  You've got to get used to it.  Can my throat get used to anything?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Don't make an adjustment.  It's gotten used to other things.  Yeah, exactly.  Sorry.  That's fair.  All right.  I can't even argue.  I don't even know. 
[02:28:00]  Kenny's sleeping.  This show's a nightmare.  Kenny, why are you tired?  I want to know more about Jim's show.  Yeah.  I'm not sleeping.  I'm always alert.  You know, looking for threats.  What kind of threats?  You know, security.  The type in your...  But you were looking at the back of your eyelids.  Are there threats?  No, no.  I was looking down at my blackberry.  Oh, you were looking down?  Everything good? 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  All clear?  Yeah.  We got an all clear right now?  In the blackberry.  Yeah, I'm good.  All right.  Yeah, I don't want any bosses around here to think that I sleep while I'm on duty.  Well, they don't know what's real and what's fake.  All right.  We make things for the show.  I don't even know what you were saying before the break was real.  I don't know if you were just trying to make us laugh.  I don't know.  I know.  Yeah, because I love my wife very much.  I was just trying to be silly and entertaining. 
[02:29:00]  And entertaining.  Well, you are.  Yeah.  And almost...  I'm pretty soon 7,000 people are going to like me on Facebook.  Really?  You're going to get 7,000?  I need 20 more people.  So who are those 20 people going to be?  Those 20 lucky people.  We don't even know your Facebook page.  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook.  Oh, there you go.  You're over 7,000 now.  I hope so.  I fucking mentioned my Instagram on the show yesterday. 
[02:29:30]  I got 20 fucking new people, man, like that.  Can you tie your Instagram in?  20 fucking people.  To your Twitter?  You can, right?  To make your Twitter pictures better.  I should do that, but I'm too busy.  You're a busy buddy.  I'm too busy.  What's going to happen when you get 70...  Another 10 today.  Sorry.  7,000.  Is that going to make you feel better?  You got 20 more people.  Now you're at 7,000.  Yeah, and then I have something to look forward to when I get 8,000.  Yeah, then the big push to 8,000 starts.  Yeah.  And unfortunately, in Ken's brain, it never stops. 
[02:30:00]  Right, so then you're going to want 9, and you're going to want 10.  10.  You'll never be satisfied.  So it's never going to be satisfying.  Yeah, but people should do themselves a favor and like me on Facebook because I have very informative information on there.  And what's the latest information you posted there that people would go to?  It's probably Jim Norton's comedy dates.  Yeah, like Jim Norton's poster for Please Be Offended is sold out probably because of my Facebook page.  It did sell out.  I was very happy about that. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Very cool.  So there's no funny sayings or quips you put up there?  Or like pictures from your personal life?  Yeah, I went to the UFC.  I put two pictures from the UFC.  What were they of?  The one guy that won with green hair, and he jumped, you know how they jump on top of the cage and go, ah, when they win?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was like right underneath them, and I took the picture, and the caption read, this guy has green hair and won his fight. 
[02:31:00]  He's just the worst.  Should we get those 20 people real soon with that?  What was the other picture?  The other picture was Nate Diaz.  I go, he won also.  It was a pretty impressive victory.  And then I'm always plugging Opie and Anthony related stuff.  Like it was probably such a great success and turnout in Cleveland because of my Facebook page. 
[02:31:30]  Probably right, Kenny.  Yeah, because I started an event.  You know how you can start an event and you invite people to attend the event?  Like a tickle party, one of those?  No, I don't do that poking.  Why don't you do a poke party?  I don't even understand what it is.  But like another event I started was at Foxwoods, the anti-social comedy show.  Yay!  Yeah, June 9th.  But it's never anything about you.  Saturday night. 
[02:32:00]  No, it is, it is.  Well, some people want to go to your page and laugh, you know, because you're a funny guy,  so you should put some stuff down.  Yeah, you can put some good stuff.  Yeah, just stories about bothering people.  You know how like, you got to put like about, like a little synopsis about yourself?  Yeah.  I have two words, satisfaction guaranteed.  There you go, Kenny on Facebook. 
[02:32:30]  A club soda, Kenny on Facebook?  Yeah, club soda, one word, Kenny, another word.  All one word, though.  Or is it spread out?  No, it's two words.  See, some people, and I was thinking of doing this, if I should spell club soda one word or two words.  It should be two words.  It should be one word.  Yeah.  That's one word.  Social networking, it should be one word.  Oh, what's social networking?  Yeah, but on Facebook, though, you could do it.  Yeah, I don't know.  People get awful confused by that. 
[02:33:00]  Maybe that's why you're...  Oh, fuck.  Maybe that's why you're under 7,000 friends, because they're confused.  Like, I'll post that Jim Florentine's like governors and Maguire's this weekend.  Yeah, he takes care of all you guys.  And you know what?  You'll be sold out.  And Joe Lund will be very...  Or Mark Lund will be very happy.  The owner.  All right.  Thanks, Kenny.  They're nice fellas, the owners.  Jim Norton played there once. 
[02:33:30]  That was great.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  And then...  What else could I tell you?  You've said enough.  All right, but we still have a half hour to...  We'll be all right.  But you should post stuff like when I went to the supermarket, the CVS with you that time.  The one was like, you have a club card?  You go, no, they turned me down.  I have bad credit.  You know, post some stuff like that, like when you fuck with people.  Yeah, that'd be good.  Your cashiers get so annoyed because that was like a thing you started. 
[02:34:00]  That was a Jim Florentine movement.  Like how, you know, like every store has those like little things you get supposed to put on your key chain.  Right.  To get a discount.  Jim Florentine started the anti-movement with that because Jim Florentine says real men do not shop with coupons.  True.  Yeah.  And club cards.  Yeah.  And club cards.  So like they ask you like, do you have your card?  I go, no, I was turned down. 
[02:34:30]  They go, you were turned down?  It's free.  I go, no, I got bad credit.  They get very confused.  Yeah, they get so mad, you know.  And then people in the line behind you, you know, they just want you to pay so they can pay, you know.  Kenny, I got breaking news for you.  What?  John in Pennsylvania.  John?  Hey, club soda Kenny, you're well over 7,000 likes.  You're about 7,040 now.  Well, that just proves the power of the Opie and Anthony radio show. 
[02:35:00]  That's really powerful.  I got it, man.  And the dedication of the fans.  For you to take your personal time and pick up the receiver and dial the telephone, that was very nice of you, mister.  Mister.  Mister John.  All right, John.  Thank you for that.  Yeah, have a good day anyway.  All right.  All right.  You too.  Florentine, anything in the sports world?  If there's one thing he knows, he knows about sports. 
[02:35:30]  He knows a lot of shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He won an Emmy.  You won an Emmy?  For what?  For his sports contribution to Inside the NFL.  Fuck yeah, man.  Really?  Yeah.  You got an actual Emmy?  Emmy award winner Jim Florentine.  You got it in your place?  Yeah.  How does it look?  It's awesome.  Yeah.  I went for like best comedy segment on HBO Inside the NFL back in 2004.  He's good friends with Dan Marino.  Could you get an autograph for my father-in-law?  He's a Marino fan?  Coming from a Jet family? 
[02:36:00]  No.  My father-in-law.  A mother-in-law, okay.  The Philly crew.  Yeah, but he's like, he loves the Dolphins over the Eagles.  Could he get that?  He'll probably work that.  Yeah?  A little something something.  He was here recently.  I wish I would have seen him, but I just forgot.  Did you get that done?  Yeah, I can work that.  I'm sure.  Don't fake it.  I think I can.  Are you going to fake it, though?  Fake what?  The autograph?  No.  He's got integrity.  Jim Florentine, he has integrity.  All right.  Jim Florentine put me in two episodes of Inside the NFL. 
[02:36:30]  Well, I know, Kenny.  The Thanksgiving special.  That was terrific.  You can get it on YouTube.  Yeah.  And the Christmas special, too.  Yeah, and the Christmas special, I play an elf.  Nice.  Yeah.  Did you play a good elf?  Yeah, whatever I do is terrific.  I'm great at whatever I do.  I remember the higher-ups at HBO didn't get Kenny's humor at all.  Really?  Yeah, I had to fight for him.  Oh, come on.  Same with Comedy Central.  The same thing we're doing to Meet the Creep stuff.  We don't get it.  I'm like, why don't you get it?  Fucking dummies.  I know.  That's just dumb. 
[02:37:00]  Genius.  See, that just goes to prove, again, what a terrific guy Jim Florentine is.  He fights for his friends.  You fight for your friends.  Yeah, I do the right thing for the right reasons.  You drown them in handling fees, but you do the right thing.  Yeah, just pay me.  Just pay, yeah.  Anything in sports?  You're not a big playoff hockey guy, are you?  The playoffs have been great, though.  What do you think about the guy that busted his kneecap? 
[02:37:30]  Baron Davis.  Of the Knicks.  Did you see that injury?  No, I didn't see it.  They're not saying it's a career-ender.  Holy fuck.  You didn't see his knee?  No.  Buckle?  Worst fucking thing I've seen in sports in a long time, man.  Laying on the court.  Like, they said a bunch of the players on the court wanted to start crying.  They were like, holy fuck.  And supposedly he's a really nice guy and they all like him.  And this is going to end his career.  His whole, I can't imagine.  What happened to his kneecap?  He was driving toward the hoop and I guess playing a little wrong. 
[02:38:00]  Oh yeah, they said at first that he dislocated his kneecap, but he tore all the fucking things.  They tear in the knee and then something else is ripped.  And it's at least a year.  Look at that.  Look at his knee.  Wow.  Just popped out to the side.  I can't even look at that.  Isn't that unbelievable?  I don't think a knee is supposed to look like that ever.  And that's before the swelling.  So he's done.  There's rumors that Linsane comes back tonight.  He'll be rusty. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, they're going to try to push Jeremy Lin onto the court tonight.  They're desperate.  They're really desperate against the Heat.  You don't watch basketball?  Not so much.  I'm watching a little more because of, oh yes, Kenny.  Let's talk NASCAR now.  This is a national TV talk.  Kenny just got comfortable.  Radio, stupid.  But he's sitting down.  He's comfortable now.  And he turned his own mic on.  I see that.  I don't know NASCAR.  What do you know about NASCAR?  It's big with the people in the south. 
[02:39:00]  Oh my God, please, clock move to 10 o'clock.  Well, what about NASCAR, Kenny?  What's going on?  Why is it so big in the south but not here in the north?  That's a very good question.  You're right.  I should try to work this.  Kenny?  Instead of watch or phone.  Instead of panicking.  I'm not panicking, trust me.  Why isn't that big around here?  We don't have a track around here.  There's one out in Pennsylvania.  What do you like about NASCAR? 
[02:39:30]  How come there's no demand for it here in New York?  The cars are nice colors.  Okay.  Yeah.  Where is the demand in the coastal states?  They're not really demanding NASCAR.  NASCAR.  No, it's a different culture.  Oh.  Yeah.  Like we don't farm that much either.  Will it catch on up here in the northeast?  Yeah.  It can be.  Like they should just shorten the races.  You don't need 500 laps.  Do five.  Five quick laps, huh? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  And then people, you know, because we're like hustle and bustle up here.  But do you really think people would sit there and, you know, get 70,000 people in a stadium  if it was just five laps?  The race would be over in like six minutes.  Yeah, but it's like a horse race.  They go around the track once, not 500 times, and they have like 10 races in the afternoon.  So you get like more than one race.  But they all want to see the big race.  Yeah, they just want to see the big stars.  They want to see the main race.  Yeah, so the better drivers, you save them for last. 
[02:40:30]  Isn't NASCAR like the most heavily attended or watched sports thing?  It's pretty much the number one sport in America.  Maybe they shouldn't change the rules.  It seems like it's working the way they have it.  It's way the fuck up there.  So I think they're doing okay in the Northeast, Kenny.  Yeah, I think they figured it out.  We just don't pay that much attention to it.  All right.  Did you know the Big East is looking for a new commissioner?  Really?  No.  I didn't know that either.  But how about you talking about the NBA or the NFL or Major League Baseball?  Or NHL or MLB.  Yeah, everything's got an acronym today. 
[02:41:00]  What's that all about?  That's a good premise.  It's solid.  Yeah, like Hamels vs. Harper sheds light on baseball's codes.  You just said, yeah, like, and then just read a random headline.  Do you know what that headline's about?  No, you would have to read the story.  That's to, like, entice you.  Right.  And, like, reel you in to read the story.  I see.  You know, here's a picture of boxing. 
[02:41:30]  Mm-hmm.  Picture of boxing.  Yeah, this is from the USA Today.  This is how he reads, though.  Just headline.  And this is the internal dialogue.  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, look.  A picture of boxing.  A picture of boxing.  Whoa.  And that's all it needs.  Here's breaking news.  It's in the paper.  That means it's two days old.  Police in Kentucky have no suspects in death of groom.  That's not breaking news.  Like, why don't they kill the bride?  Why'd they kill the groom?  He did not go there. 
[02:42:00]  There's a death at the Kentucky Derby, I guess.  It's close to the winning horse's stall or something.  Yeah, they found the body in there.  All right.  Okay.  Let's play a game now.  We have a prize to give away?  Yes.  All right.  I'll give my mask away.  The first person that knows the answer to this.  Who was hit by a pitch and then struck by honesty?  You just wanted to plug in the name in the headline. 
[02:42:30]  Well, I'm trying to get the callers involved.  We don't have a real prize.  Yeah.  Sam's SARS mask.  Oh, we do have a prize?  Travis is working on a prize.  All right.  In the meantime, you guys can just look in USA Today and get the answer yourself.  Shh.  That's too late now.  All right.  We can do this.  Did Sam just say NASCAR is not big in coastal states?  He has ever heard of Daytona.  Okay.  Has he ever heard of Daytona?  Yes.  I'm the stupid one.  What about Stanley Cup playoffs?  We could talk about that all day long. 
[02:43:00]  We're playing a game.  Yeah.  I'm clearing the phone lines for your contest now.  All right.  Wait.  I better get the answer then.  All right.  I'm going to put on my glasses for that.  So what's the first one?  The question?  Yeah.  Who was hit by a pitch then struck by honesty?  And do we have a prize?  Yeah.  We have a $75 Pro Flowers gift card.  Holy fuck.  This is like a real contest?  Can I enter?  I've got to send Sam the tag you've got to read.  Okay.  What's the question? 
[02:43:30]  Hit by pitch then struck by honesty.  That would...  Wait.  No, you can't answer.  The caller's answer.  Oh, let's get a caller.  All right.  Let's go to John in Georgia.  John?  Was it Harper that was hit by the pitch and then struck by honesty when Hamels told him  he hit him because he was young and that was him introducing him to baseball?  I think you're right, sir.  Bryce Harper.  Bryce Harper.  Phenom.  Yep.  19 years old.  Is that the right answer?  I hit with a 100-mile-an-hour pitch to the buttocks, the upper buttocks. 
[02:44:00]  Wait.  Call Hamels' name is mentioned.  I didn't get to this.  I don't read fast.  You're trying to find out who...  Are you still trying to find if that's the correct answer, Kenny?  Yes.  Bryce Harper's name is here.  The Philadelphia Phillies pitcher.  Oh, my God.  Nailing phenom Bryce Harper and then cheerfully owning up to his intentions afterwards.  Yeah.  Fucking Major League Baseball is pissed off, but he admitted he purposely threw at him. 
[02:44:30]  All right.  So that guy wins.  Today's your lucky day, sir.  Read the tagline.  Yay.  For the contest, Kenny.  Oh.  Send dip strawberries this Mother's Day from berries.com.  Click on the microphone and enter OPIE and get Mother's Day's bouquets from $19.99 at proflowers.com.  When you click on the microphone and enter O-P-I-E, spells OPIE.  That's a lot of websites there. 
[02:45:00]  That's the same sponsor?  Well, it's Gourmet Foods.  They own all of those websites.  Right.  So berries.com.  So you can use it at berries.com or proflowers.com.  Oh, nice.  John, hold on, all right?  All right.  Congratulations, mister.  All right.  Kenny, got another one?  All right.  Let me see.  Does anybody want to admit to killing the guy at the Kentucky Derby?  Call in.  Kentucky.  Kentucky Derby.  Call in.  Whoa, the Orioles are rolling and the Red Sox are reeling. 
[02:45:30]  Are they?  That's what it says.  And I do, if somebody does call in and confess to the murder, we do have another proflowers  gift card.  That's a good deal.  Yeah, but then you just got to give the flowers to the fucking person you killed.  The family.  Yeah.  Can't even give them to your mother.  True.  Alex Gonzalez is out for 2012.  You're kidding me.  Nope.  Milwaukee Brewery Shortstop.  Brewery?  Brewery. 
[02:46:00]  Brewery.  But that would have been a trivia question.  Who's out for the season?  Why is he out for the season?  That could be a good trivia.  Exactly.  I have the answer.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Scott on Long Island.  Scott, Jim Florentine's playing Governor's Friday and then McGuire's Saturday out there  on Long Island.  I would go see Jim Florentine if I was still on Long Island.  Scott, what do you got, buddy?  I was just calling up on the reason why the horse died.  Yes.  I didn't know if Norton got stuck in the store with the horse and took it a little too far. 
[02:46:30]  But, dude, your phone cropped out.  No, I didn't.  All right.  Let's go to New Hampshire.  Mark, what do you got, buddy?  Alex Gonzalez has a torn ACL.  He's right.  Yes.  God makes weak ACLs, huh?  A lot of ACL injuries.  Yeah, it usually doesn't happen in baseball.  True.  Well, you got Rivera.  He's got the ACL.  Yeah, it's more of a football one.
