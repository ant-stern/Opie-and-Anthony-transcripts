<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio broadcast, live from CES in Las Vegas, began with a discussion of their triumphant return to radio following the St. Patrick's Cathedral incident.  They boasted about their new XM contract, contrasting it favorably with Sirius XM, and played clips from their recent Fox News "Real Deal" interview where they openly criticized Howard Stern and his Sirius XM affiliation.  The hosts’ and several XM employees’ previous night's excessive drinking and antics were a recurring theme, punctuated by frequent, Danza-esque “applause breaks.” Keith "The Cop," an XM employee, was present in the studio audience.

Anthony detailed his Vegas gambling experiences, recounting wins and losses playing three-card poker and Texas Hold'em. He blamed listener Todd, present in the audience (later identified as Todd the Trucker), for his losses at three-card poker.  Todd countered, claiming Anthony's girlfriend leaving the table coincided with his own winning streak and Anthony's subsequent losses.

Studio guests included Chris Angel and Vince Neil of Mötley Crüe.  Their conversation covered their respective careers, upcoming projects, and personal anecdotes, often punctuated with vulgar language and references to drug use and sexual exploits.  Specific topics included the writing of Mötley Crüe's autobiography, "The Dirt," Chris Angel's upcoming television season and stunts (including a planned jump from a plane in a straitjacket).

The show also featured updates on Anthony's Paltalk room, now with a 1000-person capacity and improved sound quality, with jokes about it potentially becoming a cult.  They reviewed various CES gadgets, including new megaphones, retro mobile phones, and karaoke phones, launching into a discussion about the resurgence of karaoke and comparing the unpleasantness of karaoke videos to pornography.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on a nude scene performed by Howard Stern's daughter in an off-Broadway play.  Opie and Anthony played audio clips of Don Imus's comments on the situation (interpreted sarcastically by the hosts), audio from the play itself overlaid with "Daddy's Little Girl," and speculated on the daughter's motivations.  They also discussed circulating online pictures of her.

Further guests included David Coverdale (Whitesnake), who discussed his career, his "vege-quarianism," music videos, and his relationship with Tawny Kitaen; Lee Abrams, an XM Radio executive, briefly previewing upcoming programming, including a Bob Dylan show; and Laszlo, offering commentary on various tech gadgets.  A humorous anecdote about a fat man crashing a scooter at CES was also shared. The broadcast was rife with off-color jokes and sexually suggestive comments from the hosts.  The show concluded with goodbyes and mentions of future projects.

[00:02:30]  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony are about to make their return to the airwaves. 
[00:03:00]  Opie and Anthony were pulled from the airwaves two years ago after a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
[00:03:30]  Opie and Anthony are back, so why won't the SEC be able to touch them this time?  The duo has signed with XM Satellite Radio.  Their contract with Infinity expired back in May, but the no-compete portion is up until October.  No arrests have been made. Police are still investigating.  Let's do it!  The blonde one, uh, two so-called radio shots.  Our society needs borders.  It needs parameters. 
[00:04:00]  You dick!  They get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope.  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Even when there are bucks to be made, there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural degradation that we do not want to be associated with anymore.  Are you adequately prepared to rock?  Rock, rock, rock.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:04:30]  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Oh, wow, with a live audience.  A live audience here live from CES in Las Vegas, Nevada.  It's like old-time radio with a live audience.  They will do an old production number.  It's quite creepy, actually.  They're just staring at us.  Hoping that we're going to entertain them.  I don't know.  Make us laugh, funny man.  And I was a little chilly, so I asked Don for a jacket, and he brings me a girl's jacket. 
[00:05:00]  And they tell me in front of the whole fucking audience, and now they all think I'm a faggot sitting up here in women's clothing.  Yeah, the jacket did it.  You look wonderful, Jimmy.  Everyone well rested.  It's a little hard to do a show from Vegas because it's not like you're at home.  You know, there's things to do.  Well, there's a lot of irresponsibility with this crew, so, yeah.  You know, the crew is very irresponsible.  Some people don't realize that there is a job to do the next day. 
[00:05:30]  And they go out and overindulge, and for that I want to apologize.  And even our bosses are irresponsible.  We were all playing the game called Avoid Elo last night.  It was like Elo Pac-Man.  It really was.  I heard from somebody else from another unnamed, drunken XM employee that, and I was going back to the room.  I had been done playing cards, like, all night long.  And I'm ready to go back to the room.  And another drunk XM employee comes up to me and goes, hey, what's up, man? 
[00:06:00]  You having a good time?  Like, yeah, having a blast, man.  Just heading back to the room.  Got the show to do tomorrow.  You see that lounge over there?  Elo's in there, man.  You'd love it if you just came in and had a drink with him.  I'm like, is that lounge right?  All right, man, cool.  I'll see you later.  I'm going to go check out Elo.  I couldn't have given that bar a wider berth to get to the elevator.  I was, like, clinging to the wall just so Elo wouldn't see me.  Hey, man, come on in here. 
[00:06:30]  Had to get back to the room.  Got a show to do in the morning.  I was heading toward that bar, and I got pulled away from that scene as well.  But then that wasn't good enough.  We all have our BlackBerry, so the text messages are coming in like crazy.  Where are you guys?  Oh, you know what's the button on there?  The off button.  The off button.  It works wonderful here.  And if you're having a problem with the off button, a quick curl against the hotel wall.  You don't get any more mess.  Don.  Well, Keith the Cop, he got pulled into the bar, right?  Keith the Cop, everybody.  There he is. 
[00:07:00]  We're going to have a lot of applause breaks.  We're going to try applause breaks today.  Applause breaks like the Danza Show.  Yeah, exactly.  Hey, everybody, Keith the Cop.  God bless.  God bless.  Good to see you here.  And now that New York's finest.  And now that Ellen DeGeneres is on XM, Keith the Cop's going to be doing a little dance  segment in a little while.  Oh, wow.  That's going to be a treat for everybody.  But Keith the Cop.  Does he have a backup gun we can shoot him with?  So you got pulled into the bar with Hilo?  You can never pass the bar without Hilo dragging you into it. 
[00:07:30]  He sees you.  He's got like that drunk radar where he knows somebody and it's like, hey!  Oh, it's the boss.  Oh, fuck.  And then he questions me about, does he have the BlackBerry on?  I've been sending him messages.  I haven't heard anything.  Is he all right?  Is he going to go down?  I don't know, Hilo.  No.  We have a show to do.  We're trying to be more responsible in our careers.  You'd think the boss's responsibilities here at CES would be more than even ours.  We're doing a two-hour show.  So it's important. 
[00:08:00]  It's fun to do and stuff.  But if we didn't do the show today here and we were doing it from the studio, the world isn't going to collapse.  But someone like Hilo and the rest of the brass from XM that are here, that seems to me to be the important people for this event.  That should be full of their wits in the morning.  Well, they're just celebrating the fact that they're kicking Sirius' ass with all these new gadgets and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  And they have been drinking ever since, before they move on to the next project. 
[00:08:30]  I would love to say this is some line of corporate crap or something.  But anyone who takes a stroll over to the Sirius phone booth that they have set up, because they're so proud of their equipment this year, can just do the research themselves.  There is nothing going on over there.  There's no presence whatsoever.  Because they really don't have – I mean, you look at the stuff XM is putting out and displaying this year here at CES. 
[00:09:00]  It's amazing.  There's so small, so many features, you're getting live satellite radio.  On the go as you're walking around.  On the go.  And that's the most important thing, I think.  Personally, that's the most important thing.  If you're walking, you want to listen to the product that you're paying for, you want to have access to it when you have the unit.  Right.  Not plug it into your computer, wait eight hours to download something that you think you might enjoy, and then have to sit through that. 
[00:09:30]  Well, it's great.  On Sirius News, they just reported that Lennon was shot.  Fucking idiots.  Right after yesterday's show, Fox News got a hold of us and interviewed us.  Yeah, we did a little interview.  I guess a show called Real Deal.  I don't know when it's on.  And they interviewed us for maybe two or three minutes.  They'll probably use one stupid five-second sound bite.  Yeah.  So we begged the guys from Fox News to send us the audio so we could play the whole thing on our show. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  So I think the guys back in New York have some of the clips.  Oh, we got some clips of that?  We'll start with the first track, Are You Guys Scared of Howard.  Check this out.  Hoo-hoo.  Derek, uh...  The Real Deal here is with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Gentlemen, I know you guys are shaking, quaking in your boots now that Howard Cern has reached satellite radio.  Yeah, uh, wow, we're really scared. 
[00:10:30]  Uh, we've only been doing it for 14 months now.  Uh, as you hear about him talking about being the pioneer of a satellite radio,  we've been, uh, we've been here 14 months, well over a year.  Uh, the technology we have here at XM blows away the serious technology.  And, uh, that's about it.  I mean, it's...  They have Howard.  Can you hear him on a unit that isn't the size of an anvil?  I don't know.  I don't think so. 
[00:11:00]  Show him the new stuff.  This is the new thing.  Satellite radio and an MP3 player.  Satellite radio live.  Sirius doesn't really have one of these yet.  There you go.  That was the first track.  It's going to be on The Real Deal on Fox News.  The second one, this is classic.  Jim Norton, everybody.  Just slamming Martha Stewart.  Check this out.  Yeah, and Sirius doesn't have Opie and Anthony or Fox News Channel, I hear.  No.  You want to listen to Fox News Channel, you need XM.  Because they actually wasted all their money on Martha Stewart. 
[00:11:30]  That's what you want to listen to when you're 25.  Some 50-year-old bisexual with a mullet.  She stinks and she's a crook.  And I hope she bombs on Sirius.  Technologically, they're the equivalent of actually calling somebody on a rotary phone  and having them hold it up and listen to it.  Why do you keep lowering the microphone?  This is very Freudian.  Could you lift that up?  That's how I got this gig.  Thank you.  Hey, I don't think I got my gig.  No, listen.  Tell us what you really think, Jim.  I mean, honestly.  We don't care about how we're going or not going.  It's good for satellite radio.  Good for him.  Right.  But as far as they don't even have a presence here because it's antique what they have. 
[00:12:00]  And XM is smashing their stupid faces technologically.  Yeah, the best part of that interview, the guy from Real Deal on Fox News just kept lowering  the microphone.  Yeah, he's lowering the mic towards his crotch.  It was a really annoying slash hot.  Yeah, that was one of those things he really didn't want to hear what you were saying.  Yeah, he was just being polite.  Oh, and you're their friend.  Oh, fuck you.  Wasted videotape.  Wasted videotape.  It's never going to be used. 
[00:12:30]  He was actually waiting to ask me questions so they know exactly where to cut.  Yeah.  Well, that's why I love getting the raw audio because none of this will be on the real deal  on Fox News.  Here's the third track talking about competition and whether it's good or not.  Hit it.  But you got to agree, at least on some level, that competition is good for the whole industry,  correct?  It's great for the industry, obviously, but XM has 6 million subscribers.  Sirius has, what, 3 million or something like that?  And they didn't show up here this year because we were just making them look silly with all  the brand new technology that XM has. 
[00:13:00]  So, and I mean, the thing about Howard, he admitted finally that he's been doing subpar  radio for 10 years.  In that same 10-year period, Anthony and I made our names for ourselves.  And he was blaming the FCC and all that.  He just doesn't have the passion to do this type of radio anymore.  Simple as that.  And he's going to find that out within the first three months when the spotlight kind  of dims and it's not all about him going to satellite radio.  When he actually has to go in there and do a show, he's in for a big surprise.  Wait until his bosses find out his passion lies at about $500 million. 
[00:13:30]  And that's it.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Provocative.  Ooh.  Yeah, they're not using any of this.  And then finally, one more track here.  This will be maybe some of this on The Real Deal on Fox News.  I think they're going to air it Monday.  That's what I'm hearing from Steve.  Steve, everyone.  Another applause break for...  Wow.  This is like applause break central now, Opie.  Oh, we're going to do it just because it's going to be annoying as hell for everyone.  I had a great time kill. 
[00:14:00]  I wish people at home could see what a creep Steve looks like slumped over.  It's like he's on the toilet on his laptop.  All slumped over, fucking typing.  Five minutes without catching exponential amounts of shit from you.  Is that on?  Yeah.  Sorry, yeah.  Exponential amounts of shit from me.  God, dumb it down, will you?  Back on the old toilet balls, Steve.  Ramon, bring me a bent back idiot.  There you go, the first Ramon. 
[00:14:30]  We're going to do a lot of Ramones today, too.  God, Steve's got to dumb it down, though.  He's just got to stop with the big words.  What does it exponentially mean?  Yeah, stop.  A lot.  What?  It means a lot.  So why didn't you say a lot?  Because it wasn't the first word that came to mind.  Ugh.  What?  Do you have a thesaurus on the bull?  Are you one of those guys?  Yes.  I sit there with a...  It doesn't necessarily mean a lot, Steve.  There's no more to it.  It does mean that it is growing at an accelerated rate each time it makes another step forward. 
[00:15:00]  Exactly.  Of course.  These fuckers are calling me right now.  Even from New York.  Travis, you suck.  A long-distance joke.  That joke cost him $3.50.  It certainly did.  And it never gets old.  All right, here's the final track.  O&A on the real deal on Fox News.  Some of this will air.  Steve, hit it, guys.  You guys sort of fought the same demons that Howard fought when you were on Terrestrial  Radio, correct?  Absolutely.  But that's what I'm saying.  In that same time, using the same rules, we made a name for ourselves, and he blamed 
[00:15:30]  the system on how, on the reason why he was doing subpar radio.  And you didn't even have a building named after you.  No, unfortunately not.  We're working on that.  We do, actually.  It's called Show World.  And if you want to know how outdated Sirius is, their mascot is a dog with a black eye.  It's like a domestic violence ad for animals.  They stink.  It's a big, clunky unit.  You can't walk around with it.  It's awful.  Boy, we're bashing Sirius here at The Real Deal. 
[00:16:00]  So, anyway, thanks for watching The Real Deal.  This is The Real Deal from O.B.  Anthony Jim.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to edit all that out, except for the part about the little  radio thing.  That's Dave's.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Why edit that out?  That's the funny stuff.  That's the stuff you want to hear, but...  You want the funny editor, you know?  They're going to make it boring.  I really should be the spokesman for this company.  Stop trying to be polite.  When they ask me at a press conference, what do you think is Sirius?  It eats the ass of a Haitian. 
[00:16:30]  We forgot to talk about your gambling yesterday, Anthony.  Yeah, a little...  I'm here in Vegas, of course.  I saw you around 9.30 at the Hold'em tables.  Yeah.  I was playing Hold'em for quite a while.  And it looked like you were there all day.  No, actually, I started out...  I was responsible.  I ate.  I didn't leave the compound, though.  I went right to the Rainforest Cafe, which is...  Yeah, I don't mind the food there and stuff. 
[00:17:00]  I'm not looking for anything extravagant or fancy or anything.  But every three minutes...  God forbid they sit you next to that elephant with thunderstorms and everything.  Yes, I'm in a rain forest.  I get it.  Okay.  All right.  It's going to do a chimpanzee display in the bus, boys, but I'll leave that joke alone. 
[00:17:30]  The make-up-your-own.  Cook.  So we went there.  Me and my girlfriend went there.  Have a great drink there.  It's, like, that big.  It's full of rum and some kind of Kahlua and banana.  It's full of goodness.  Lots of goodness.  Couldn't stop drinking those.  And then I went to the three-card poker table.  I don't like running right to the hold'em table, because that's kind of a time commitment thing, you know. 
[00:18:00]  I just want to loosen up a little at the three-card poker.  And I'm playing there.  Doing very well.  Both of us.  Name my chick.  Doing fine.  What do you mean by doing well, by the way?  Doing well.  Well, I usually play about $125 a hand with the $25 chips.  If you know how three-card poker's played, fine.  If you don't, sorry.  Look it up and figure it out. 
[00:18:30]  So I play, like, you know, $125 a hand, something like that.  I started winning a lot.  I hit a straight flush, which paid off big.  They give me the $1,000 chip, a bunch of black, $100 chips.  So now I'm playing like I played with the green, but with the black chips.  So now I'm betting about $700 per hand is going down as I'm playing.  I'm a player, baby. 
[00:19:00]  And it's working.  I'm winning.  And then...  Well, before that, how much were you up?  All right.  I started off my bankroll at that table.  I pulled $400 out of my pocket and just got some chips and started playing.  I had built that up to about just short of $3,000.  And I had the black chips and everything, and I'm playing and winning, and we're having  a great time.  And then a listener comes over. 
[00:19:30]  Is he here today?  Oh, he's here.  You saw him?  Yeah.  Oh, I saw him.  His name is Todd.  And...  Everyone's pointing at this one guy on the floor.  If this guy...  They're all pointing at him.  You might want to get a picture of that guy because he's about to get killed.  The biggest cooler, it was Todd H. Macy in the cooler.  This guy, the second he approached the table, it was a turn of fate. 
[00:20:00]  And I don't care how...  If you gamble a little, a lot, you notice when the luck changes, and you look around for  anything that changed during that time to blame it on, whether it's legitimate or not,  whether it's fate or not, whether it is him or not, you have to blame it on something.  Not only that, but if you're...  I have a little gambling etiquette to you, sir, quickly.  If you're sitting, standing next to a table, because he wasn't playing, he was just hovering. 
[00:20:30]  If you're hovering over a table, and you see some guy, and he's playing $700 every hand,  odds are, he doesn't want to hear you yap about the show.  He wants to see what the fuck the dealer's turning over.  You know what I mean?  I'm paying to enjoy myself and see when that dealer flips his three cards over,  if I won, I want to know in a second. 
[00:21:00]  I don't want to hear, so, does Jimmy like getting shit on?  Or, you know, things like that.  If, you know, at the $5 table, come on over.  We'll have a pisser.  When that much is being invested in a hand, I want to enjoy every nuance of the game.  And then we did push him back.  Yeah.  I said, please, you have to step away from the table.  You're a mush, is what they call a mush.  I was ready to get some mob guy to lock him in the bathroom. 
[00:21:30]  Complete mush.  So we pushed him away onto the walkway part of the rug.  And when he came back, even the dealer went, no, no, back, get back.  Even he knew that I was getting a little edgy with this guy being so close  and just sucking the luck out of the place.  What Anthony is saying, sir, is don't attempt human interaction and friendship  while he is addictively flushing his future down the toilet.  Well, Ben is in the crowd. 
[00:22:00]  Let's hear it for Ben, everyone.  There's Ben.  Another applause break.  The applause break is going to take up a lot of time today.  We like that.  What's your name, sir?  Todd?  Todd the Trucker.  Todd the Trucker.  Oh, you took pictures of us and threw it on Wackbag, too, right?  Yes, sir.  Okay, I recognize you.  So you saw Anthony playing three-card?  Yeah, let me defend myself here.  Good fucking luck.  I didn't want to bring this up because it's brought up on the show all the time  and it's kind of getting ran into the ground. 
[00:22:30]  But Anthony is definitely a fancy man.  And obviously why he was playing where he was playing  and playing as much as he was playing  because only a fancy man would play that much.  Yes.  Truth of the matter is, Anthony was sitting there with his girlfriend  and I sat down at the table and started playing  and his girlfriend got up and left.  And she went to the bathroom or something.  And the minute she left, I started winning.  Anthony then started losing.  And he's blaming it on me. 
[00:23:00]  And he started crying and whining and,  Bring her back!  Bring her back!  How long after, how long after,  how long after my stack of black chips  turned into a single one I was playing with,  did you then decide to pull out that bankroll of 40 bucks  and sit down at the fucking table  and play one hand?  I mean, it was well after I had already been devastated  by the time he decided to stop yapping 
[00:23:30]  and actually play the game.  And that was the only reason you were near the table.  This was long before the girlfriend went to the bathroom  and you sat down.  I just noticed the stack going,  ching, ching, ching, ching,  just down further and further and further.  Is it safe to say you lost thousands of dollars  after he sat at the table?  So, I personally am saying  this man cost me about $2,500 last night.  Yes.  And Todd, what kind of questions were you asking Anthony  as he was playing? 
[00:24:00]  Three cards.  I don't remember.  And neither do I.  That's good.  I was trying to be cordial, courteous,  but when you have that much invested in a hand,  every hand,  you kind of want to see the cards flip over.  So it was like,  wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Dealer has a pair of aces, fuck.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh, good.  I got a pair of kings.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Dealer has a flush, fuck.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  That was my night. 
[00:24:30]  That was my night of three-card poker.  Why didn't you just tell him to go away?  I did.  And that didn't work?  He went, like, onto the walkway,  and the second he went onto the walkway,  who got a flush?  I did.  And then he started coming back,  and the dealer told him,  get back, get back.  If I just,  Sir, I got to tell you this.  You are just,  you're the luckiest man in that casino.  I don't know what happened last night,  if you gambled, if you won or lost.  The luckiest man,  because Club Soda Kenny is not on this trip. 
[00:25:00]  If Kenny was here,  I,  they would still be prying your head out of the,  in between the lion's head doors,  on the elevators.  They would still be figuring out  how your head got in there.  Hi,  is this man bothering you, Anthony?  All right,  Todd the Trucker, everyone.  Any last thoughts there, Todd?  No?  Todd,  tonight,  we'll,  we'll play at the $5 table.  We'll have some fun over there. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  He's kidding.  He's very approachable.  Just talk to him,  touch him.  He likes all that shit.  Touch his face.  It's romantic.  He loves it.  He loves the caress.  I ended up at the,  at the Hold'em table.  Well,  that's where I saw you.  Yeah.  You looked miserable.  You looked like you were,  you were there a long time.  Well,  no,  I,  I enjoy the game.  I love it.  I got the second half of the story,  and I thought it might have been Todd.  No,  you got it from kook number two.  Yeah,  there was kook number two out there.  Is he here today?  The guy that was staring and studying how Anthony was playing Hold'em. 
[00:26:00]  This guy studied me,  apparently.  I'm getting this second hand through Opie.  Studied me,  and then gave Opie all this info,  how I was in such danger.  Right.  That Opie should run over there,  and tell me how to play fucking Hold'em.  Well,  Lindsay and I came over,  said hi to you guys,  and then,  you know,  just checked in,  whatever,  and saw that you guys were doing well.  Uh-huh.  And we went to go eat,  and as we're leaving the Hold'em area,  a fan grabs me and goes,  dude,  you got to get back to Anthony.  He's blowing it.  He looks depressed.  He's staring at his chips. 
[00:26:30]  They're going to eat him alive.  They're going to eat him alive.  His strategy stinks.  You got to get in there.  And the guy was freaked out and obsessed.  He was just staring at your,  at the way you were playing Hold'em.  So I should have taken his strategy,  like if I got pocket aces,  go,  oh,  goody.  Oh.  I play  very subdued.  I sit there.  I don't smile.  I don't frown.  I'm not crying.  I'm not laughing.  Whatever cards I get,  I put my marker on top of them, 
[00:27:00]  whether they're good or shit,  until it comes around for me to make a decision.  And then I either bet,  or I fold my fucking hand.  I don't smile.  I don't fucking frown.  I sit there with my arms like this,  the same position the entire night.  It's called a poker face.  It's called a body language strategy.  This guy was in a major panic.  The guy was in a major panic.  He had no clue how to play the game.  You know why?  If he was next to me,  the whole time would be,  hey,  this is fucking busy, 
[00:27:30]  man.  What do you call it?  You get a good hand?  You got to smile sometimes.  You look depressed.  No,  I'm playing fucking Texas Hold'em,  idiot.  You're not supposed to make expressions.  Yeah,  so how'd you do at the Hold'em table?  Oh,  I lost my shirt.  I,  well,  no,  I,  I,  I did all right.  You know,  it was up and down most of the night.  I was getting great hands,  but every time I,  I,  I was playing them,  somebody else had something a little better. 
[00:28:00]  I'd have a pair.  Someone's got three of a kind.  I'd,  I remember I got smashed on a,  I had Queens and 10s and a guy had a flush,  you know,  it's just that that's the type of life.  And sometimes that,  that happens.  But,  uh,  my girlfriend bailed me out of that.  She was down to like 42 bucks at one point and left with,  uh,  over a grand,  uh,  at the Hold'em table.  It's going all in.  People folding.  She had great hands.  So,  uh,  it all equaled out.  What was up with that steroid freak at your table? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah,  there was a guy that I was,  I was frightened.  To,  to just bet against them.  He had a huge stack of chips and,  uh,  arms like,  uh,  eggplants.  And,  uh,  yeah,  he'd,  he'd push in and I,  you know,  I,  uh,  I,  I,  I fold.  Yeah,  I wanted to like a couple,  a couple of hands,  you know,  I could have stayed in for the river to see if I would have gotten a,  a straight or a flush.  And I'm just thinking if I suck out on the river,  this guy's going to punch me right in the face.  I threw $20, 
[00:29:00]  I threw $20 into a video,  a poker machine.  And I stayed there until it was up to 60.  And I walked away.  Wow.  Yeah.  Security came,  brought me up to my room so I wouldn't be hassled.  An armed guard.  Jesus.  All right,  we're going to take a break.  We've got lots of people stopping by to say hi.  On the way,  we've got Chris Angel.  He was on our show in New York.  He was a lot of fun.  Also,  Vince,  Vince Neal's here.  Oh,  very cool.  Also,  we're going to check in with Laszlo, 
[00:29:30]  see what's going on here at the CES.  It's the Opie and Anthony program live from Las Vegas,  Nevada.  We'll continue in just a bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony show live from Las Vegas.  Watching a bunch of retards flying to Hufflepuff.  Yeah,  that's what we do.  Cause we're perverts.  That's right.  Stupid.  The Opie and Anthony show.  It ain't pretty.  And I'm just my soul. 
[00:30:00]  We're back live at CES in Las Vegas, Nevada.  It's the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  The ONA virus has made it to Las Vegas.  We've got Chris Angel and Vince Neal.  We're thinking we should just throw both guys on the show at the same time 
[00:30:30]  and see what happens.  All right.  You guys,  let's hear it for Chris Angel and Vince Neal making their way to the stage.  Also on the way,  we got Laszlo.  He'll talk about some of the gadgets he's been checking out here at CES.  By the way,  you know,  earlier when we played the clips from the Fox news interview and when we asked  for them,  they didn't come right on.  And I blamed it on Derek.  Derek is sent to communique saying,  Anthony,  that was Eric not paying attention.  to the program. 
[00:31:00]  So it was Eric's fault.  Eric's fault.  Again.  And not Derek.  Gentlemen.  Look at that.  I can't even see Vince.  How are you doing, bro?  There's Vince Neal and Chris Angel.  And a crowd of people just staring at you.  I'm going to make them all fucking disappear.  Right about...  You could do that, couldn't you?  No,  Vince is like I do.  He actually taught me how to do what I do.  No, he made me appear here today.  Hey,  is there any way, 
[00:31:30]  because I watch your show,  is there any way,  see that guy Todd over there,  is there any way you could put hooks in his back and lift him up with a helicopter?  For enough money,  anything is possible.  And then drop him in the desert?  Just so you know,  Todd cost Anthony a lot of money at the three-card poker table last year.  Yeah.  Well,  we can make some of that money back.  We'll go play after this and I'll help you,  you know.  Yeah,  now,  I got asked.  If they let me play,  if they let me play.  Do they let you play in the casino?  Some of the casinos will not let me play. 
[00:32:00]  Some of them will let me play.  I don't understand what the logic is behind it,  but,  well,  you're good with your hands.  No,  no,  but why do some casinos have no problem with allowing me to play,  and some of them do?  I don't know,  I don't understand what the,  why?  Yeah,  yeah,  why wouldn't they all just say,  hey,  get out of here.  Yeah.  We'll bust your legs,  you bastard.  Can't the cameras catch the sleight of hand stuff?  No.  You know,  honestly,  honestly,  they're more concerned about the card counting than anything,  you know,  but they have those machines now that, 
[00:32:30]  you know,  just constantly are mixing everything up,  but,  but there's always a way,  you know,  there's a will,  there's a way.  See,  but there's another thing,  not just sleight of hand with the cards,  the chips.  You can slip a bigger bed under there if you win.  The chips and the chips.  And take a bed away.  Yeah.  Take a bigger bed away when you get a losing hand.  A little distraction.  Boop.  It's done like that.  And very quick.  And I've seen you do stuff where I don't know where the hell anything is in your hand.  You know,  you just,  it completely disappears in plain view.  And that would get me a little shaky if I was on at a casino. 
[00:33:00]  I wouldn't let you play.  I plead the fifth.  I wouldn't let him play because he's banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  The players couldn't get a drink.  If I were you,  all I would use my powers for,  I would just like dangle something in front of a girl's face.  And the next thing she knows,  she'd be waking up,  wiping her mouth,  going,  what the fuck happened to me?  You do that,  Jim.  It's called a roofie.  Seen it happen.  Also,  we have Vince Neil on the stage.  Yeah.  Vince, 
[00:33:30]  you had a huge year.  Yeah.  An absolute huge year.  Motley Crue just selling out all over the place.  And now you're hitting Europe with the Stones?  No,  that's not until later on the summer.  Oh,  later on the summer?  Yeah,  we start back up in February.  We do the U.S. again.  And then,  then we go out with the Stones for a little bit.  And then,  we're doing a co-headline thing with Aerosmith.  Wow.  To finish out the year and into next year.  Do the Stones call you those crazy kids?  The Stones call you young bastards. 
[00:34:00]  I hate these new kids and this new music these days.  I hate these kids.  How bad did you want to punch Larry King when he said,  I'm motley crue?  Yeah.  That's right.  You know something,  Vince,  I got to ask you something.  Don't be,  try to be cool,  man.  We were watching that,  like,  as we were doing the show.  We could not stop watching it over and over.  When he's like,  and here they are,  for the first time ever,  this rock group or combo is making their way to the stage. 
[00:34:30]  The Motley Crue.  Oh my God.  You know who you want to punch?  Your fucking agent at that point.  The guy that set that up.  I felt like,  you know,  we were like a really Vegas lounge show there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey,  it's the Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue.  Yeah.  The Motley Crue.  Are you guys all getting along on tour?  No,  we hate each other.  You still hate each other?  No,  no,  no,  no,  no.  It's all good,  man.  We love each other.  Yeah,  right.  No,  I'm serious.  I'm serious.  We all travel separately. 
[00:35:00]  You know,  when enough time goes by,  man,  there's just a different perspective on life,  and he's still a fucking dick.  You realize no one changes,  and that's the problem over time.  Well,  you can put up with anybody when there's a cash that's coming in.  Exactly.  That's exactly the way we look at this radio show.  That's what I think.  No,  no,  the thing,  no,  we've,  you know,  we've gotten older,  obviously,  you know,  and it's,  it's like in your kindergarten,  you know,  if someone pulled your hair,  you don't hold a grudge for the rest of your life. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  I mean,  it's like between me and Tommy,  we've been,  you know,  friends for 30 years,  and,  you know,  we've punched each other many times,  you know,  throughout the years,  and I'm sure we'll do it again.  You know,  as I think,  because the only reference point I have is with the fans that I were in,  that was in that,  believe me,  not even close,  my friend,  to where you've been,  but what I've noticed is when you're younger and full of piss and vinegar,  and you're,  you're like playing,  and your life is that band,  you're rehearsing all the time, 
[00:36:00]  you're in the studio with each other constantly,  more fights,  more button heads,  as you get older,  you're really not with each other as much,  you don't see each other as much,  and,  and you kind of start thinking back,  those are some good times,  man,  let's hook back up,  we'll do a few things,  and it takes a little longer before you realize,  it's the same fucking asshole he was that day.  Except he's got,  except he's got kids now.  Yeah,  got kids now,  and there's a little more of a buffer in there,  in time, 
[00:36:30]  that you've spent with each other,  you know,  you kind of live together when you're younger,  and,  and in a band.  Yeah,  we just,  we just make it comfortable for ourselves,  you know,  we just found that being comfortable,  you know,  traveling is,  you know,  you don't have as much attention anymore.  You put everybody on the same bus,  you're in everybody's face,  like,  you know,  24 hours a day,  and it's just,  you know,  it's just easier to do it on your own,  your own schedule,  and you just show up at the gig,  and do your thing,  and you smile,  and have the money,  and have some fun,  you have fun, 
[00:37:00]  you look forward to being on stage every night,  and you don't have the pressure of making it anymore,  you know,  you guys have done it,  you know,  it's not like a bunch of guys trying to get that record deal,  and trying to get to the next level,  which is probably a lot of pressure.  Yeah,  I guess,  it's been a long time,  man.  How much,  you want to get to the gigs at completely different times,  just have XM book your travel.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  You'll never see each other,  we had some problems.  How much longer do you think you guys are going to do it? 
[00:37:30]  I mean,  the whole thing,  or just this year?  Yeah,  the whole Mind the Crew thing.  I don't know,  we got a new,  we're going to record a new album before we go out to Europe this summer,  so that album will be out,  you know,  2007,  then we'll start all over again.  I mean,  we're just,  you know,  being with the Stones kind of like showed us something,  it was like,  I mean,  these guys have been doing it for 30 something years,  40 years,  I don't know.  You know,  we've done it,  we're doing a 25 right now,  and,  you know,  let's just keep going until everybody gets bored with it, 
[00:38:00]  you know,  there's no reason that you can't just go out and even tour like every,  you know,  every three or four years.  Yeah.  And so just go out and have some fun,  and still have your,  maintain your,  you know,  your life,  and stuff like that.  You guys sounded great at the HD TV.  I just saw a high definition concert you guys did.  Oh,  yeah,  yeah,  thanks.  You sound great.  Yeah,  thanks,  man.  I redid all the vocals here.  I'm kidding.  The magic of the studio.  How is that,  though?  Is it rough as you get older to keep, 
[00:38:30]  because the type of music you guys do,  obviously,  to have a younger voice would be a lot better.  You get a little older.  Some people kind of lose the pipes.  It's harder to hit those high notes.  Not really,  you know,  because like,  even when I wasn't with doing the Motley stuff,  you know,  I would be touring on my own.  And so it's just like working out,  you know,  it's a muscle.  It just keeps getting stronger and stronger and stronger.  And my voice right now is probably the best it's been in,  you know,  in many,  many years.  So you just got to keep doing it. 
[00:39:00]  You just,  you stop for a few years and then,  yeah,  you're going to be rusty just like anything else.  Right.  Yeah.  Hey,  but I want to tell you guys something,  man.  Check this out.  We're Motley Crue,  right?  You know,  we're the,  we,  we,  we,  we've fucked around with everybody in the whole world.  And especially,  you know,  from Los Angeles,  they're giving us a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in two weeks.  And that they're going to,  you know,  and then it becomes Motley Crue day in Hollywood.  That's pretty fucked up.  Are they out of their fucking minds? 
[00:39:30]  I hope they're pretty fucked up.  I hope they realize what we stand for.  You do Larry King then.  You guys used to vote the Motley Crue.  Here's a star for the Motley Crue.  These guys probably used to puke on that side.  Why the hell there's going to be a star down there?  I hope they take yours and put it over that Queen Latifah,  that fat bitch.  Why is she getting a star?  There's no reason for that.  Thanks.  So angry.  Unbelievable.  And Criss Angel,  what are you up to?  I have another season coming out,  which I'm beginning to shoot in February.  It comes out in June,  doing 21 new episodes. 
[00:40:00]  I have a...  Mind Freak.  I'm actually writing some music right now.  I've been doing music,  Long and in Magic,  and I'm writing an album right now  with Jonathan Davis from Korn,  which will be out this year.  And a bunch of stuff, man.  It's keeping busy.  Always very harrowing  when he's doing something.  I watch the show,  and it's like,  uh-oh,  he's going to die in this one.  Like everyone's always very worried.  Yeah,  this season,  I made a little departure from that.  You did?  Yeah,  I'm not going to become a caricature of myself,  not about killing myself.  So I proved that I could do those stupid things, 
[00:40:30]  and so now I'm moving on to a new direction.  It should be interesting.  Cool.  Hopefully some growth there.  Because it's like,  it was always family members going like,  oh,  I don't want him doing this, man.  I don't want him doing it this time.  Well,  the fishhooks,  when I hung from the fishhooks,  you know,  by a helicopter.  Yeah,  that was a little much.  That was pretty cool.  That's some crazy shit.  I mean,  I thought we did crazy shit,  but man,  this guy's a crazy part of that.  And I wasn't wasted either.  Yeah.  Do you remember it afterwards?  Unfortunately.  I still have nightmares about it.  We actually,  I remember one of the stunts you guys did 
[00:41:00]  was a girl dangling from a helicopter  held by nothing but Motley Crue's penises.  Boy,  that was dangerous.  Well,  we dropped her off at home,  though.  She made it home safely.  I should mention this real quick,  that I have the first season out on DVD,  which is available in any of the...  Look at you.  Go check it out.  ...and the chrisangel.com website,  not to plug anything,  but plug,  plug,  plug.  And he's a big fan of David Blaine,  so...  Oh, yeah,  absolutely.  Me and David are like this.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:41:30]  We got into that last time  you were on the show.  You check out any of the...  He actually came by.  He was very gracious.  He came by,  and I did something,  and he said some very nice things,  but, you know,  it's cool.  The world's a big place.  It's big enough for...  You check out any of the acts in Vegas?  Any of the magicians  and illusionists?  Yeah,  well,  Lance is one of my good friends.  Traditional guy,  but does a nice show,  and amazing Jonathan's a blast.  He's very funny.  What about David Copperfield? 
[00:42:00]  No, huh?  Not my C, dude.  No?  It's old school.  What do you think of...  Yeah,  he actually called me  a couple of weeks ago.  He was really upset with me  because he still thinks  he's, you know,  relevant today,  and I think he is,  you know,  but he was very upset  because I said that  he was old school,  so I can't say  he's old school anymore.  Now,  when he lost Plutty Schiffer,  that was a...  Yeah.  That was a disappearing act  that...  He's still trying  to conjure her back again.  He's waving his arms.  He's pulling silk  off of the bed  and she's still not there.  Yeah.  Where'd she go? 
[00:42:30]  He pulls the covers back,  it's Doug Henning.  That's horrible.  I'm supposed to get  Magician of the Year  by the Magic Castle.  So I think I just  lost that this year.  I think I just lost that.  No, no, no.  Stop.  What do you think  of Penn and Teller?  Penn and Teller are good guys.  Actually,  they're good friends of mine  and I made a deal  with Penn every time  he mentions my name.  I get by him dinner,  so I think I'm up  to like 33 dinners  with him right now.  That's cool.  But I'm doing the show.  He has a show now.  I'm doing the show 
[00:43:00]  next week and they're  going to be on my  television series.  So they're funny guys.  They're really crazy.  He should have bet Teller.  Yeah, he doesn't speak.  So you're doing  your second season.  You're doing another album  and touring Europe  and I'm fucking doing  Albany at the end of February.  Tonight's Comedy Works.  We'll be there.  That should be a good  awful plug.  That was pretty smooth.  The worst way  to slip a plug in.  Well, I just wanted  to make sure everybody  knew that we're three people 
[00:43:30]  on equal footing.  And how will people  find out about  where that specifically is?  Do they have a website  or something  that they can go to?  Funny you should ask.  You can go to  eatabullet.com.  That's my website.  Eatabullet.com.  Yes.  That's not like a...  That's also where you can  get Chris's and Motley  Cruz information  all off my website.  You guys checking out  the technology here today  or are you guys...  Where is she?  Do you have any gadgets  when you're touring  on the bus?  It's my cell phone, man. 
[00:44:00]  That's it?  And XM Radio.  And XM Radio.  That's it, yeah.  None of the gadgets  still get you.  Yeah.  I mean, a lot of the...  You walk around here,  it's like, well,  some of them  pretty cool, useful.  Other ones,  it's like,  what kook thought this up?  This is the problem  with technology.  I think technology  is brilliant,  but the problem is  is that they always  release things  that are not  completely worked out  and they still have bugs.  And then, like,  you buy the thing,  you have problems with it,  and then six months  still goes by  and they have  the new one coming out.  And then you gotta buy that.  And then you gotta buy that  and that still has some bugs. 
[00:44:30]  It's called staying in business.  It's the way  they stay in business, man.  There's a car  right around the corner  that has a waterfall.  Why?  I don't know.  You open up the hatchback  and it has an actual waterfall  from the top.  Is David Bling in there?  Yeah.  It's called the Ted Kennedy.  Or when a chick looks in  and goes,  what's that?  You just fuck her real quick.  Awful young man you are.  So no gadgets at all  on the bus, huh? 
[00:45:00]  I mean, how do you guys  pass the time on the bus then?  Fight?  Yeah.  Well, no,  because it's really just me  and a security guard,  you know,  and Tori.  They really do  travel separately.  I love it.  Yeah, we don't really  spend a whole lot of time  on the bus, you know.  When you do,  it's like after a show,  you know,  and when you go to bed,  you go to bed,  you wake up  and you're in the next city.  Yeah.  And then,  so you don't really,  you know,  hang that much on the bus.  You know,  you guys gave us  a great bid for our radio show,  the Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  Yep. 
[00:45:30]  You guys were on in New York  and we started doing it  right after you guys left.  The Wiffle Ball Bat Challenge.  They had a challenge,  the Motley Crue Challenge,  where they,  we heard about this,  this double dong  ballast.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And there would be  a $100 bill  in the middle  and the first girl  to reach the $100 bill  She got it.  She got it.  And you inspired us.  We didn't want to  completely take it verbatim.  So what we used  was a Wiffle Ball Bat  and any girl 
[00:46:00]  that would come in,  we would,  you know,  use it,  mark it with a marker  and then the next girl  that would come in  and at the end of the year,  whoever's mark  is closest to the middle  of the bat  from either end  would,  and I mean that  bat-wise  and woman-wise,  would win a prize.  And that was completely  very inspirational.  And actually,  the winner,  the winner is right there  with that mustache  at the computer  and his name is Steve.  Steve just,  Steve just trying 
[00:46:30]  to mind his own business  getting slammed.  You guys wrote  one of the greatest rock books.  Is that going to be  a movie someday?  Yeah,  they're still working on it.  What happens  is we had a director  that Paramount  assigned to the movie  and then he got moved  to do some  $150 million blockbuster thing.  Yeah.  And so it just took  a lot of time  to find another director  that we wanted  to do the movie.  What was the name  of the book again?  The Dirt.  The Dirt.  One of the best  rock books ever.  Judith Regan  put that out, right? 
[00:47:00]  What's that?  Didn't Judith Regan  put that out?  Yeah, she sure did.  I remember.  She was talking  about it.  We did really well.  Yeah, yeah.  That was just  no holds barred.  Just let loose, man.  What it was all about  at that time  being a high-profile  rock band.  Just disgusting  the way you guys lived, man.  It wasn't that disgusting.  It was fun.  We were disgusting.  Yeah, I'm just hearing  about the apartment.  Oh, the apartment  was disgusting.  The real showers.  We've all lived  in an apartment  like that, though. 
[00:47:30]  Absolutely.  Just don't give a crap  about anything.  Didn't you guys compete  who could go the longest  without showering  at one point?  Yeah.  I fucking love that.  Yeah, Nicky won that one.  How long?  While having sex  with girls, too.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I never watched.  You would not shower  and then have sex  with another girl  and another.  Yeah.  I think he went  like a month or so.  I swear to God,  it was great.  That's what being  a rock star is.  When I was 15,  this girl Karen  was giving me a Hummer  and I had been drinking  so my bag was sweaty  so I put baby powder  on it and she'd blow me  and she went  and she stopped. 
[00:48:00]  Well, see,  what I used to do,  we used to go to get  a bean and cheese burrito  and that would take  the smell off.  Hey, rub your junk  on the burrito  or the burrito  on your junk.  I don't know why,  but it worked.  It's like a,  I think I got that  from Martha Stewart.  Another helpful hint.  Oh, very nice.  So when do you  start shooting?  The last week of February.  I think it was  20 something,  26 or so. 
[00:48:30]  Here in Vegas,  actually,  for 16 weeks.  So if you live in Vegas  and you want to come out  and check out  some stuff live,  you're welcome.  So what's it going  to be more of  if not the...  It's going to be,  well, the Levitation episode  was the highest rated,  actually it was  the number one show  on cable,  not to pat my back.  Is that where  they were in the park?  Yeah, yeah.  And I did it  on Fremontree.  So I'm doing something now.  I'm going to float  from one building  to another building  in the middle of the day  time in front of the public.  I was actually  going to do it  right now for you  from here to over there, 
[00:49:00]  but a lot of people  didn't want to see it,  so...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, come on.  I was like, yeah.  You are going to float  from one building  to another.  Yeah, and then I'm  doing one crazy thing.  I'm going to jump  out of a plane  in a straitjacket  and try to escape  in time to pull  my parachute  and it's going to be  live on television.  So if I don't do it,  it was nice knowing you all.  Are you really going to be  jumping from the plane?  Yeah, really.  Honestly, yeah.  Yeah.  Or is it going to be a trick? 
[00:49:30]  No, it's not a trick.  It's honestly not a trick.  You're really going to jump  with a straitjacket,  get out of it,  and then pull your chute.  I'm going to try  to get out of it in time.  I'm going to train  like a motherfucker.  I would want to know  exactly how long  I could get out of it.  It would have to be  second nature,  and I still wouldn't do it.  What's the mental process  you go through  where you're on a plane  and you go,  you know what?  I'd love to jump  out of this tied up.  Well, I try to make  engaging television.  Unfortunately,  I sometimes have to  put my life on the line  for it,  but I don't really, 
[00:50:00]  it's not like  Daredevil stuff.  I really,  I know it sounds like it is,  but I really do,  due to due diligence,  I have a great team around me.  I train like a maniac on it,  so it's not like  I'm just doing things  for the sake of,  you know,  like jackass.  You getting any crap  from networks  or parent groups saying?  No, no.  I mean,  two episodes got banned  with Jonathan Davis.  I had him,  it was the first person  to ever really catch  a bullet in my mouth  in a metal cup  that was designed.  They banned that one,  and I played  mental roulette with him, 
[00:50:30]  which was with a 357,  and I basically told him  which chamber  the round was in,  but it got banned,  but it's going to come out.  I just got the rights  from A&E,  so we're going to release it,  and it will be out  maybe on one or the other.  You should put a disclaimer,  though,  like only try this at home  if you're under the age of 10.  Well,  but what's weird is  is that like  they banned that,  but like when I light myself  on fire,  which, you know,  matches are readily available  to kids,  you know,  they don't say anything  about that one,  so it's like,  it's the whole fact 
[00:51:00]  that it's a gun,  but I don't want anybody  ever trying anything I do  because you will kill yourself,  you know?  Don't try to figure it out.  It doesn't make any sense.  A lot of it's bullshit,  and a lot of it's  completely real,  so it's up for the audience  to determine what is what,  so.  How do you get a pilot  to agree to fly you up there  and let you jump out  of his plane?  You have to sign it.  There must be,  you must just,  that's the biggest trick  or illusion  is the fact that  you can still use your hand  with all the disclaimers  and stuff.  You must sign it.  The insurance  is just insane. 
[00:51:30]  Do you have life insurance?  Is it possible?  It's just absolutely insane  what it costs,  but Arthur Ashe  got life insurance  easier than you.  And then you have to sign  a letter to indemnify him  from like if I kill myself  that he's not responsible.  I had to sign one  for Jonathan,  but we have a lot  of great guests  that are going to be on.  Maybe Vince is going  to make an appearance  on.  I'm going to try, man.  That'd be real cool.  We're going to do  some crazy things.  All right.  Well, guys,  thanks for stopping by.  It's Chris Angel, 
[00:52:00]  everyone.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  Vince, anything you  want to plug?  I think I did it.  I think you did, too.  Vince Steele,  everyone,  from Motley Fool.  I think these guys  are sticking around  and signing some autographs.  We're going to continue  in just a bit.  David Coverdell on the way  and we'll talk to Laszlo  next.  Stay there.  Thank you.  Holy crap.  Live from Las Vegas.  Shut up.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  I love you.  Insane.  Bye.  I.  Stinks.  Stinks.  That's hilarious, 
[00:52:30]  actually.  All right.  We're back with the  Opie and Anthony program  live from Las Vegas,  Nevada at CES.  The ONA virus  making their,  making its way west  to Vegas.  Anthony has some good news 
[00:53:00]  about the whole  Pal Talk thing.  Yes.  When I reboot it,  we should have a room  that will now fit  1,000 people  and it has been  upgraded  to the green room  and we will have  better sound quality.  We're getting there.  Laszlo made a good  observation there.  He thinks you're  starting your own cult  with the Pal Talk.  Starting a cult there.  It's Pal Talk.  So just by the name alone,  they are your pals. 
[00:53:30]  Pretty soon their leader  will tell everybody  to wear purple Nikes.  It's,  no.  Castrate themselves.  It's like Pal Talk.  So they're your pals  and then you got  MySpace.  You have a friends list.  They're all your friends.  It's all very nice.  For a guy that doesn't  like to talk to people  in public,  should you like chatting?  This is perfect for me.  I sit at my house.  It doesn't have to  shake your hand.  No shaking hands.  Nothing.  Shaking hands to me  now means my computer  linking up to a network. 
[00:54:00]  The handshake,  shaking hands connected.  And then I pour some  of that antiviral stuff  on my keyboard  and I'm ready  to make friends.  You know,  actually,  just a few booths over  is a booth  that reminded me of you.  There's many different  kinds of megaphones  that you can test out.  Oh.  It's a megaphone booth.  So if you're not happy  with your megaphone.  I might be able  to find a megaphone  that sounds more  like a telephone  than an oldie time radio.  Some of the telephones  at this show  actually look like  old time telephones. 
[00:54:30]  Like there's a new  mobile phone coming out  from Samsung  that has like  a rotary dial on it.  Stop it.  I swear to God.  And there's a huge thing  in Japan now  that people are getting  handsets,  like old school  phone handsets  with the curly  Q cord  and plugging it  into their mobile phone  so they're walking  down the street  and it looks like  they have a home phone  in their pocket.  That's great.  Next thing you know  they'll be flying  fucking planes  into your battleships.  And what's up  with the karaoke phones? 
[00:55:00]  Oh my God.  They were showing me  LG has this phone.  You know,  as if mobile phones  couldn't get any more annoying  especially with that  like push to talk  chirp shit  where you can hear  both sides  of the conversation.  Now they have  the karaoke phone.  It plays music  and you sing along to it  while holding it up  in the air  and it records you  singing along to it  and then you can post it  to maybe your friends  at Pal Talk  or MySpace  or wherever.  So you could be  on a train  singing anywhere  and doing karaoke  in front of people 
[00:55:30]  until somebody  punches you  and shoves the phone  up your ass.  That's going to boost  sales of the shotgun phone.  Every year  at CES  the karaoke area  gets bigger.  I've noticed  karaoke  is kind of  another resurgence  in karaoke.  It goes in waves  and unfortunately  there is another  resurgence of karaoke.  What do they got?  What are the newest?  What's the best karaoke?  Is it still just the same? 
[00:56:00]  The discs?  The bad videos  that play in the background?  Or just  they have microphones now  that everything's  inside the mic  you just plug it  into the television.  It does the video,  it does the audio,  that's it.  What is worse?  Doing double penetration  hardcore pornography  or being an actor  in a karaoke film video  that plays behind that?  You ever see that  my eyes adore you  and there's some girl  looking  like everything  is taken literally  like a million miles away  and they show a map 
[00:56:30]  of a million miles  and everything's  got to be literal.  Last year,  I don't know  if she's here this year  but Debbie Gibson  was a  she had her own  little special.  We missed out.  She's doing  karaoke demonstrations.  Really?  You know your career  has come to that  in good shape.  Again,  she's looking  for the shotgun phone.  I hate the way  during karaoke  everybody's so supportive  of each other  and they should just  be fucking heckling  each other  when somebody's up there  belting out a tune.  You stink.  You are it.  I don't know why  when that joke was bombing 
[00:57:00]  I had to yell  you stink  like that would  really salvage it.  Exactly.  Exactly.  How about a little  Oh Dear Lord?  I did that one.  I didn't hear it.  Hope that woke  the crowd up.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Did you check out  the plasmas?  They're like 102 inches now.  It's bigger than  the screen that you  Yeah,  they've gotten ridiculous.  I don't know where  you're supposed  to put these things.  Is it on the roof? 
[00:57:30]  Is it something  for Times Square?  Evidently in the back  of your car  because we're in the hall  where all the car  audio and stuff is  and why people  are mounting plasma screens  in the trunk  of their automobile.  You've got to have  them on all four doors  on the dashboard  when you lift  your trunk lid  there's got to be  a TV back there  and a waterfall.  They didn't turn  on the waterfall yet.  I want to see  the waterfall car.  I want to see it.  But the good thing  is that  them making TVs epic 
[00:58:00]  brings down the price  of the ones  that you can reasonably  put in your house.  Yeah,  flat panel TVs  have dropped 40%  in the last year.  So you can actually get  there's a couple  of models here.  Plasmas,  42 inch plasmas  for $1,800.  You know what though?  I went to buy one  and that guy Todd  came up to me  and all of a sudden  the price was $5,000.  The mother...  Just going to let it go.  I'm trying.  Maybe tonight.  By the way,  there's no sign  of Elo still.  Elo is...  Let me picture Elo. 
[00:58:30]  Hotel room,  bed,  wet rag on forehead,  moaning,  groaning.  Doesn't he have  some high profile  meetings today?  Who knows what he does?  Does anyone really  know what he does?  Yeah,  he's got a meeting  that's called  Alcoholics Anonymous.  And he's not  picking up his phone,  so...  Of course he's not.  Right now he's like,  who's pounding on the door?  He's laying in his own  vomit nude  on the flicking  bathroom rug.  Hey,  don't make it hot.  I noticed that 
[00:59:00]  most of the executives  are not here right now.  No.  They were celebrating  all night with the new gadgets  and they're still not  here at CES.  Drinking all the profits.  You know,  I go to a lot of trade shows  and I have to say  the absence of the  little doggy company,  it's embarrassing.  It's really kind of weird.  Well,  all their eggs  are in one little basket  and it's not  the technology basket.  I mean,  you walk outside here  and there's planes  circling around  the convention center 
[00:59:30]  with XM banners.  It's like XM everywhere.  That's nice.  Chris Angel's  jumping out of one  right now as we speak  in a straight jacket.  He's practicing outside.  You underestimate  Sirius, though.  They actually have  a competitive thing  for us.  They have the  Wise Guys show,  which is like  a bunch of the Sopranos  being funny and stuff.  Like, you know,  hey,  you're going to whack you.  There's got to be  funny day after day.  I can listen to that  and just laugh.  I got whacked.  Cut it out.  No, he didn't.  Hey, how you doing?  You know, 
[01:00:00]  only four hours to go.  One of the things  I noticed about this show,  it's so big now.  You know those scooters  that fat people have  or sort of disabled  people have  that just makes them fatter?  There's a big difference,  by the way,  between the disabled person  using a scooter  and the fat person.  Exactly.  They're renting those things  at this show.  Why?  Because it's so much  ground to cover?  It's so big  and, you know,  fat people get tired easily.  So I saw this fat guy  just sailing through  a booth on one,  did not realize  that there was a step.  And we eyes. 
[01:00:30]  Dude,  it looked like something  out of Jackass.  He goes flying  and the scooter  actually tilted  over on the right side  and he almost fell over  at which point  he got his cane  and righted himself.  And he must have, like,  blown out the suspension  on this rental scooter.  I would have loved  to have seen that  in slow motion  in front of Caesar's Palace.  As his legs break  and he ragdolls  his fat body.  I was really hoping  he'd die  at the end of that story.  Yeah, you have sympathy  for the disabled people. 
[01:01:00]  You know,  you get out of their way  and stuff.  But when I see some tubby  driving one of those things...  And they haul ass on them  and you're supposed  to get out of the way.  Fuck them.  I don't have sympathy  for the disabled.  I bully them.  I ask Keith the cop  to go to his trunk,  we get some spike strips  and have some fun.  Hey, we have some audio  of Imus.  Imus was talking  about us today.  Imus.  He was trying to give us  some advice.  Yeah.  What did he have to say?  He wants us to leave  Howard's daughter alone.  What is this about?  What did we do? 
[01:01:30]  I don't even know.  We just reported this story.  Actually, I think  there was a story  written in the post  because of what we  discovered online.  Let me tell you something.  We love the I-man.  I love Imus.  He's been very supportive  but the realistic part  of this whole thing  is Imus is not a kid anymore.  He has gotten up there in age  and if you've noticed  older people,  I've noticed with like  my stepfather and stuff,  they get sensitive 
[01:02:00]  and emotional over things  they never used to.  Sentimental.  Sentimental.  You start seeing them cry.  Yeah, tears will come  to their eyes.  Watery eyes.  Where years ago  he's pounding CC  and driving a boat  into a slip  that he doesn't fit into.  You know,  and now it's like,  you know,  oh, that telephone commercial  where the daughter  calls the dad  and you're like,  oh, you can act like a man.  And I think Imus  might be hitting that mark.  It's a little rough  because if he's getting upset 
[01:02:30]  that we're talking about  Howie's daughter  doing a nude scene  in some Jewish play,  Imus plays.  And there may or may not  be pictures of  Howard's daughter naked.  Let's throw some  bologna on her ass,  Robin.  Why don't they get  the guys with the laser  pointers to point out  the faults?  Well, yeah.  Why don't we do that?  I couldn't think of  the perfect girl  to rip that bit off with. 
[01:03:00]  But Imus wants us  to leave Howard's daughter  alone.  No.  Here's the audio  from this morning.  Let's go to track one  if Eric's paying attention  back in New York.  Eric, get off the  wrestling site, faggot.  Hit it.  Howard Stern's daughter,  Emily, has abruptly  been pulled out  of an off-Broadway show  in which she appeared  stark naked.  Yeah.  And there are some  pictures in the post,  too.  I'll leave it down.  And the Daily News.  And the Daily News.  But it's a wild shot  with, she's playing  actually Madonna  in the show Triad, 
[01:03:30]  which is, you know,  obviously it's about  the Kabbalah  and the famous  follower of Kabbalah,  which is Madonna.  And so she appears  in these yellow panties  and a cone bra.  And in the finale,  the rabbi,  who's the executive  director of the show,  tells her that if she  gets naked,  the Messiah will come.  And she strips off  all of her clothes,  and then the rest  of her cast  also gets nude,  and then they worship  her body parts.  Hmm.  And it was panned  in the New York Times 
[01:04:00]  as dreadful,  mind-numbing,  and in bad taste.  How great would it be,  though,  if she ended up  on Opie and Anthony,  you know,  sticking cucumbers  in her private parts?  I mean,  something should be  all there?  Is there not something  here that is  looking for a silver lining?  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Leave the guy's kid alone.  Oh, Imus!  That wasn't bad,  though.  It's all you trashed,  you guys.  No, no,  he didn't trash,  but that's kind of like  your dad telling you,  you're not taking  the car tonight. 
[01:04:30]  Leave this guy's kid alone?  The shit that Howard  had to say about Imus?  You are his son.  Are you going to listen  to Dad?  Hell fucking no.  Howard made a living  exploiting other  people's daughters.  That is what got him  to the point he's at,  is the total exploitation  of other people's daughters.  And it is a sweet justice  that his daughter  appears nude,  that there will be  nude pictures,  and that he is,  no matter what he says, 
[01:05:00]  disgusted and embarrassed  by this and knows  that this is something  she is doing  to directly get back  at him for whatever  problems they've had  over the years.  That is how I see this.  All right,  we got another track  from Imus this morning.  Listen to this.  Here's what I want to say,  and I just hope  Opie and Anthony.  And, you know,  I'm very close to Opie.  In fact,  I think he may be my son.  Yes.  And I do like him.  I just,  I would say to them,  just,  let's not,  let's just lay off  the Howard Stern 
[01:05:30]  daughter story.  I think there's  some things that,  you know.  If they do that,  then they're pussies.  Yes.  They have to go  after her and him.  I would be very  disappointed in them  if they were to do that.  I would implore them  and beg them  here this morning  on my program,  the Imus Wayne program,  to just rise above it.  Rise above it.  Sure.  ONA,  this is your morning  to rise above it.  I think I'm going to do it.  And not to challenge  the stripped,  naked appearance  of Emily Stern  in this, 
[01:06:00]  I guess it's just  an atrocious  off-Broadway show.  Off-Broadway.  Some things  that ought to be  off-limits  and I just said,  take the high road,  boys.  I just,  I just implore  and beg  my friends,  O.P. and Anthony,  and I said,  I must go sit O.P.  to try to take  the high road  because as Kinky said,  there's no mud  on the high road.  Hopefully,  I'll get a report  later today  on whether,  in fact,  they took my advice.  They,  unfortunately,  often do not.  All right,  you guys,  let's hear it 
[01:06:30]  for Iman.  Oh, man.  See,  these guys  standing this clip  and going,  oh,  I'm begging you guys  to leave Howard's  daughter alone.  It's so obvious  it's being sarcastic.  Who heard that  and didn't read  the sarcasm?  That sounded like  serious questions  only,  people.  Serious questions  only.  Oh,  I'm so relieved.  It's obvious  he wants us  to go after  his daughter.  Please,  I'll leave  the girl alone.  She,  you know.  We started  this ball rolling  and we're going  to continue  rolling with this  one,  right?  This,  and for some  reason,  the newspaper  won't report  it. 
[01:07:00]  It's directly  because of  this program  playing  Daddy's Little  Girl  as her  horrific audio  from this play  is being broadcast  at the same time.  Do we have that?  We should play that  again for everybody.  Basically,  we added  Daddy's Little  Girl  to the clips  of Emily Stern  doing her  nude thing.  Nude scene,  but these are  her words  from the play  over Daddy's  Little Girl  and the pests 
[01:07:30]  getting involved  on various  message boards  and it got out  there and Howard  gets wind of it,  of course,  and told her  to stop.  I mean,  it's so obvious  what happened there.  It's an embarrassment  to him.  This guy  is going  into another  medium.  He's going  from regular  radio to satellite.  Very risky  venture for some  people,  especially him,  and he doesn't  need this kind  of evil  publicity.  He wants it 
[01:08:00]  all about him,  him, him,  and not his  naked daughter.  This is what  everyone said.  If you listen  to Howard back  in the golden  years when it  was a fun  show to listen  to,  some people  that were pissed  at him said,  Howard,  you have two  daughters.  What happens  when they  grow up?  And it was  never an issue  because I guess  he thought  time was going  to stand still.  Well,  they are grown  up.  This girl's  22 years old.  She's well  within the age.  She can do  whatever the  hell she wants.  She has decided  to take an  acting career,  which entails  taking her 
[01:08:30]  clothes off.  To bring the  Messiah.  Right.  That's my  favorite part of  it.  To bring the  Messiah.  Well,  God bless.  Good job  raising your  kid there,  Howie.  Payback as a  bitch.  First we had  that little  episode at the  hospital after  the jingle  ball.  And now we  have this,  nudity.  And there may  or may not  be naked  pictures of  her.  This girl  sounds like  a goer.  Of his  daughter.  Sounds like  a goer to  me.  And if you  have some  of these  pictures,  you might  want to  email them  to steve  at foundrymusic.com. 
[01:09:00]  Absolutely.  If you want  to check them  out.  But here's  the clip  we threw  together.  Her audio  and then  daddy's little  girl behind  it.  Listen to  this.  Spiritual  Sexual  Worthy  and  rainbow  My  dress  My  pot  of gold  My  white  shiny  leg  My  china  My  ass  are  all  godly  God

[01:11:00]  a little  bit  a little  bit  well  horrible  acting  by the  way  Jimmy  you're  an  actor  what  do  you  think  it's  hard  to say  because I  didn't  see it  I  would  say  that  the  singing  is  a bit  subpar  yeah  but I  didn't  see  the  role  she  should  have  gone  my  vagina  yeah  when you're  dealing with my acting  it's very difficult to hold other people to the same standards that I hold myself to  yes  because I'm pretty much I'm very involved in my roles  and I don't appreciate any type of joking about my acting  sorry  well that's an ongoing story we'll have more on that  and later I'll be playing the part of a guy who would love to be blown

[01:19:00]  and get one of those  good uh  high paying jobs  uh  minimum wage  wonderful  living in my car  great career fucking choice  i made there  but uh  that one  every single song  just about fucking  and you gotta respect that  that was before  i was a vegetarian  there's no  no god damn  rainforest songs  in there  no songs about  happy touchy  good feelings  and stuff  it was about  shagging  hey  if you don't like it  spit it out  it's about a hot bitch 
[01:19:30]  spit it out  hey that's romance  that is romance  we need more songs  about fucking  there's not enough songs  about fucking  these days  and more wind tunnels  and videos  by god  i love it  i love the wind tunnel  well now white snake  also uh  had some of the most  memorable videos  well introduce us  to tawny katane  tawny katane  on the hood of the car  in the white dress  uh  and of course  your relationship  with tawny  ah yes  yeah  ah yes  ah yes 
[01:20:00]  this is a history program  this is now  history  fucking archaeology  this history channel  look  we all have our demons  we just want to live  through you  for a couple of days  and that's why  yeah  now  now  but the thing is  you're the guy  that got to wreck her  and then send her  on her way  because  for some reason  after coverdale  where's she going  didn't she go  to the ball game  i think  no i think it was  uh  down the old  down the old  slope  i don't know  we have somebody 
[01:20:30]  this delightful  lady here  asked me  if there was any  dialogue with tawny  no  no  not anymore  see that mugshot  out of her  unfortunately  you did  you ever wake up  next to that mugshot  no  no  never  never like that  i was hoping  it wasn't just  a good makeup job  and everything  she had changed  somewhat  davis like  what the fuck  are you  holy shit  it's a triple bagger  it's like  there's an awful  tawny there  but  no  very hot  that was like  what was going on  mtv 
[01:21:00]  just cranking up  really  it was early days  early days  i probably imagine  it's like this now  with the early days  of what you guys  are up to  yeah  with satellite radio  stretching boundaries  seeing how far you  could go  yeah  because you guys  got into it  when mtv's just  kicking up  you know  it was incredible  yeah  you guys are  playing it  before the video  it was basically  frankenstein  it became so powerful  they actually dictated  what they wanted  from the artists  that was the time  i backed off  yeah instead of the music  dictating  this is one  this is yeah 
[01:21:30]  this is instead of  writing a song  they actually said  this is what we want  and this is the kind  of video we want  and if you don't  do this  when i worked with  jimmy page  jimmy and i are from  the old generation  but fucking videos  weren't invented  you know  you played a show  if you didn't go to the show  you didn't see the band  it was that simple  occasionally you put out  a film that made  no fucking sense  whatsoever  and you'd have to  go to the 99 cent theater  and stroke a bunch of pot  and watch it  you gotta see the  I would say to that  though it's hilarious  yeah  yeah so you know 
[01:22:00]  to talk him into  doing videos  was fucking hilarious  you know  oh they want us  to spend a million dollars  in a gothic castle  somewhere  and he's like  go fuck yourself  what do you think  of today's music  in general though  i don't really  sort of look at  i've never been involved  in fashion  in every aspect  and i haven't  like taho  i'm a veggie aquarium  what the fuck  do you think  you know  i just asked  who snoop was  no  do you know  who snoop is  no  come on  he's everywhere  my son is actually  introducing me  to a lot of like  black eyed peas  and stuff like that 
[01:22:30]  he's nine  so  does he  does he think  dad's cool  or is it one of those  things where it's like  he's interested  you know  he's been to some  of my shows  i came out of  retirement a few  years ago  so i've been doing  shows around the  world  and uh  so he's actually  seen this  rather than some  horrifying pictures  and scrapbooks  i'd be shoving it  down their throat  i'm cool  you fucking  i'm a cool guy  not just dad  but he's uh  he's got all the  instruments  he's got a band  called dry ice  you know  basically anybody 
[01:23:00]  who comes over  is in the band  don't play anything  they charge you  a buck to watch  him rehearse  you know  it's hilarious  you must have  heard all the  criticisms over  the years  of the uh  the uh  robert plant  oh he's a  robert plant  ripoff  how would you  answer that  i've been doing  it almost as  long as robert  so it's never  really affected  me robert and  i actually  were friends  until i started  selling lots of  records  and then all  of a sudden  i became his 
[01:23:30]  fucking nemesis  you know  but i think  working with  pagey and  doing well  is a suitable  stick up his  ass  one thing i always  thought that put  you ahead of him  is uh  all the shagging  songs  well yeah  that too  but the uh  the ability  to sing these  songs live  and have them  sound like you  recorded them  your voice  was always  has always been  amazing  still is  and uh  i think robert  plant kind of  over the years  ah what  happened  something happens 
[01:24:00]  i don't know  with the instrument  diet coke  i don't know  see  i gotta stay  away from the  diet coke  gotta be a  veg aquarium  and uh  and then he  still belt out  the uh  belt out the  songs  so you're still  playing obviously  yeah just i do  six months a year  six months a year  yeah that's maximum  i enjoy you know  i'm sorry to say  but i love enjoying  my family at home  family life  watching my son  watching my son  grow you know  which is hard  on the road  you know as  uh they said  in spinal tap  you don't want  to be some  six-year-old  fucking wanker 
[01:24:30]  just playing  heavy metal  oh but it's  that's  that's not  fucking change  just you know  the who are  going out  this year  yeah but you  yeah but you  get to go  when i started  be a family guy  hey anthony  when i started  it was like a  tennis player  you would if you  didn't make enough  money to open a  bar or fucking  like ringo wanted  a hairdressing  salon you know  by the time you  were 24 25 that  was it you know  you were back in  the paid shop  yeah really  but i mean so  now the bar is  constantly if you  stay in shape you  stay you know 
[01:25:00]  what i do is  just don't ignore  what my body  says it doesn't  want anymore  diet coke and  what's that i  haven't had a  diet coke for a  lifetime how  happy were you  that sabbath was  finally inducted  into the hall of  fame oh i had  bluebirds flying  out of my ass  are you guys  gonna do the  white steak thing  again or  well that's what  i'm doing  so you guys got  back together and  you're starting  up again  i've got tommy  the drummer  he's with me 
[01:25:30]  and it's a whole  new bunch of  snakes great  players uh  very fresh  basically it's  white snake  redecorated you  know new music  and all that  we're talking  about it this  year it's never  it's not really  an industry to  to encourage  that the last  thing i want to  do is get  involved with  the big corporation  say let's get  tawny in the  fucking video  you know  yeah which is  like the no  brainer you  know and these  days you would  run her over  with the car i  think  come on that's  funny  i want my hood

[01:30:30]  white trash  oh uh we promised  we would get lee  abrams on the on the  show before we got  out of here  oh wow  and no sign of  coverdell to lee  abrams  no sign of elo yet  no no  is it the uh  shareholders meeting  do they end up  throwing up  vomiting  we're getting lee  abrams on the show  here  we only have a few  minutes left  on the show  these two hour shows  are killing us  they're exhausting  they really are  you know one hour  goes by and then  what do you got  another hour 
[01:31:00]  and you just gotta  sit through it  here he is  the legend  lee abrams everyone  well hello  hi  hi  you're the only  executive that has  made it here today  yeah i know  i think there's some big investors conference or something going on  you didn't feel like going to that one  nah  i had to come and check out you guys  you're wearing like a suit thing  i know  you're not a suit guy  no not at all  you look very uncomfortable in that  i'm horribly uncomfortable  but no tie  no tie  thank goodness  so you're keeping it rock and roll right 
[01:31:30]  absolutely  i'm surprised you don't like tie a bong around your neck  i can do this once a year  how cool was it to see david coverdale  totally unbelievable  yeah but the lee has seen them all  i know  there he is  he hung out with paul mccartney  i mean  well the big news is the bob dylan show coming next up  yes now  what is this about  well you know he's coming out of the closet so to speak  hey hey hey what accusations are you making here  coming out of the studio 
[01:32:00]  um  because he's kind of been a reclusive over the years  totally  but he did 60 minutes  and he did the book  and he did the scorsese thing  and i think he wants to kind of demystify himself  and he's been working on it for five years  and finally you know  he owns 12 xm radios  which should help  that's pretty cool  and finally he wants to do a radio show  and it's going to be uh  but lee here's the problem  we don't understand what he's saying  who's going to translate the bob dylan show  we are going to have a  is there going to be a separate channel to translate bob dylan show 
[01:32:30]  we're going to do the show  and then immediately afterwards  someone will translate what he says  the first channel that has to have subtitles on your unit  that's going to be unbelievable  he's going to do it  but actually i was talking to you  and you said that uh  he had to train himself to talk like the old bob dylan  or something like that  you were telling me that  maybe it's not for the radio  who knows  yeah  as lee abrams laughs uncomfortably  shut up  do you think bob listens to the opie and anthony pogrom  uh  absolutely not 
[01:33:00]  yeah he's kind of out of our demo right  you know what he listens to  he's addicted to hank's place and bluesville  it's the only channel  oh really  hank's place  yeah  i can see him  we'll support his show  when it comes on wholeheartedly  we'll get him as a guest  no it'll be a good one  likes the sound of those pouring beers  on hank's place  the nickel going in the jukebox  right  see  absolutely  brings you right into the atmosphere  did you fly here  across the head  no it's a company business  i can't fly a company business  see remember that  that we heard  when it's company business  he can't fly his plane 
[01:33:30]  because god forbid anything happens  and someone's injured  then xm could be held liable  though i am willing to sign a waiver  a disclaimer  whatever it takes  but i'm working on it  so you had to get on a regular flight  yeah it was horrible  oh man  you know what i could have beaten it too  because it was two hours to get through security  plane was three hours late  and i would have made it  yeah  and think of how much more tie stick  you could have carried  in your plane  than uh in your baggage  well i can't  i can't talk about it  of course you can  we know 
[01:34:00]  we understand  on the IT  all i know is  whenever you get into a city  you're on the toilet  looking for balloons  you see uh  that deserve more fuckers  fucking about it  you are right  uh you see uh  brad pitt  is now going for his pilot's license  and you know what kind of plane he has  same one i have  i know i i read that  same plane  uh  we saw the pictures in the paper  and that's where any similarity  between you and brad pitt  ends  that's fine  we saw the pictures in the paper 
[01:34:30]  and we're like  oh look how cute this is  we saw the same pictures of jfk jr  next to his plane  yeah  is that a good first plane to have  no it's terrible  i'm thinking a cessna 152  probably a good first plane  much better  that was the problem with kennedy  it's like imagine a 16 year old kid  gets a lamborghini  he's going to crash it  a what  uh  fast car  a lamborghini  a lamborghini  uh whatever  for  i think you'd want a high wing  something  something nice and slow  not as much performance  yeah exactly  and uh 
[01:35:00]  the volkswagen of the air  yeah  well he's feeling the pressure  because angelina jolie  flies  angelina jolie  yeah she's got the uh  uh  she's got a plane  and supposedly she flies him  and her kids around  all over the place  yeah  both of them  they've got like a hundred hours  it's very scary  i wouldn't fly  no  but hopefully we all know how that will wind up sooner or later  i wouldn't fly with them  don't worry about it  whatever happened to just being rich and having a learjet and a pilot that someone flies  and you're supposed to be in the back doing blow 
[01:35:30]  like heft  back  there's still a lot of them going on  instead of having to worry about air traffic control  pay somebody  and i gotta talk  travolta started the whole thing i think  oh he's got a lot of planes  he's got like a passenger plane  he's got a 707  he's got a 707  yeah parked in his front yard  he actually has it in his front yard  where he can taxi it out  to his own private runway  this is a 707  this was like the workhorse of passenger jets in the 60s  absolutely  and the bca  that is what he flies 
[01:36:00]  through a goof  and he's got a crew  it takes three pilots  he's got a whole crew  he's got a crew  yeah  all scientology creeps  double j  and the other guy  and then some guy fucking a net in the back  hey your net  cigarette  jeez that is an old movie  no no no  jeez that got nothing  i just want to announce to the crowd  i mean not that we're not racing to the finish line here  but we will be uh  we will be signing over there afterwards  so if any of you want to come by 
[01:36:30]  and get us an autograph  or give your condolences for our last 15 minutes of radio  holy shit  we all drank bum water  at least  doing well  at least terrific  i'm talking about  we got anyone else coming to xm  besides bob dylan  anything else in the works  any big announcements  any hints  nobody can talk about  uh  but yeah lots of the works  nothing you can talk about  so secretive all  can you actually  you know what  i did get a phone call from yoko ono 
[01:37:00]  who wants to do a show  all right  does she do it  does she  but now we're talking to him  what's it going to be called  the it should have been me channel  uh  yeah good  of course  hold on lee  let them enjoy that gem  a patriot missile has been sent up  and taken out that one  incoming bomb  very nice  jimmy  you hate the who right  i don't hate the who

[01:38:00]  Robert Plant.  Okay.  Black Sabbath.  Oh.  No, you're not.  Well, you're there.  Bill Ward.  Yeah.  I want to do a show with Bill Ward, an hour.  Just, you know, a little radio thing.  That'd be great.  I didn't mean to oversell it.  How loud did the mics have to be turned up to hear a man sucking another man's cock for an hour?  Let's find out right now.  Get it?  All right, Lee.  All right.  You helped us out for five minutes. 
[01:38:30]  Lee, you have clearance to take off.  Okay.  Well, great to see you guys.  A little airplane joke.  Okay.  It's Lee Abrams.  Thanks, Lee.  Anytime you need to fill, yes.  We'll call you.  We'll call you when we need to fill.  I guess we're just about done here from Vegas.  Hey, Lee.  Go.  This is the worst.  God, I love that moment.  It works like that. 
[01:39:00]  Did David cover y'all take my sunglasses?  You could only dare to dream that he stole your sunglasses.  Hey, Jimmy.  What are you doing tonight?  Porn awards?  We have a rehearsal at 4 o'clock for the AT&T Awards, and then I'm nothing.  You have some lines, I see, that you've been rewriting.  Yeah, we're working on them.  The porn awards you're working on?  Working on them, yeah.  Yeah.  You wouldn't want to go over a few of them.  No.  Would you guys like to hear Jimmy go over some lines?  Come on, one line. 
[01:39:30]  Just one line?  One line.  All right, one line.  Do the setup.  You're going to be presenting an award, right, Jimmy?  Yes.  An anal award, right?  I'm presenting the award for best anal and best ethnic-themed release, Asian.  Yes, they have an ethnic theme.  This is the line.  He's got your sunglasses.  It's great to be back.  I get to present two of my favorite awards, anal and Asian. 
[01:40:00]  The only problem is whenever I have anal sex with an Asian girl an hour later, I want to eat ass again.  All right.  And that's my rewrite, believe me.  The original way they wrote it, nowhere near as clever and fun for all.  All right.  Laszlo, anything else?  Not much else, but you should stop by and see that Elton John has a booth over there where he's selling signature pianos.  They're red and they play by them really. 
[01:40:30]  And there's plenty of headroom underneath them.  That must have been a lovely ceremony.  A bunch of robes and a barking animal.  To you.  Playing a theme song to Philadelphia.  Wow, way to make it real.  Way to be hurtful.  All right.  I guess we're just about done.  Let's hear it for Laszlo for helping us out today. 
[01:41:00]  The man that actually does a little work and research at this thing.  He's always well prepared for the show with notes and all sorts of things.  He goes, he interviews people.  How many interviews do you have laid down with people?  So far, I've interviewed 32 people.  32 people he's interviewed.  That'll show up on your...  On the Technofile.  Technofile, yeah.  Starting next week.  Yep.  Very good.  Check that out.  Where can people hear that?  It's on about 20 or 30 different XM channels.  Yeah, every so often you'll be listening.  Laszlo will pop in and give you a little tidbit on some of the tech that's going on. 
[01:41:30]  It's also at my website, LAZLOW.com.  No Steve.  No Steve.  All right, we'll end with Keith the cop.  Keith, come on over here.  Keith.  You got anything?  Nothing.  Nothing at all.
