<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a bizarre phone call from Max Cook, a seemingly Ambien-addled Tony Soprano impersonator, delivering a rambling, profane, and surreal eulogy shortly after James Gandolfini's death.  This was followed by clips featuring Scott Thorson, Liberace's former boyfriend, who graphically detailed his relationship with Liberace, including explicit sexual encounters and Liberaceâ€™s cosmetic surgeries. Thorson also made shocking and explicit claims about his relationships with Michael Jackson and his involvement with the Wonderland murders, recounting his own near-fatal shooting.

The show then shifted to professional wrestling.  Opie and Anthony discussed their interactions with CM Punk and The Miz, culminating in a surprise in-studio appearance by Fandango.  The hosts' repeated mispronunciation of his name led to Fandango's departure, though they did receive WrestleMania tickets from his representative.  CM Punk later called in briefly, discussing his recent work, including a storyline involving the theft of Paul Bearer's urn (with the family's blessing), and expressing excitement about WrestleMania in New York City.  This segment also included discussion of Jim Norton's interaction with Fandango, involving lotion application (and allegedly, pec and dick lotioning), documented in a tweet.

A substantial portion of the show featured a surprise visit from Heather B. and another unnamed cast member (Mike) from *The Real World: New York*.  They reminisced about their time on the show, discussing their personal lives, the filming process, relationships with crew members, and comparing the original season to later ones, referencing other cast members like Puck from *The Real World: New Orleans*.

The show continued with a discussion about freedom of speech in comedy, prompted by a recent controversy.  The hosts debated the line between intended humor and genuine offense, the comedian's responsibility to their audience, and the challenges of tackling taboo subjects. Anthony Bourdain's near-death experiences, particularly an ATV accident in Colombia and the dangers of filming in the Congo (highlighting corrupt police and military forces), were mentioned.

An unnamed guest, recently returned from filming a documentary in the Congo, described the extreme dangers of filming there, detailing encounters with rebel groups and the use of local fixers who employed bribery and negotiation (often involving threats) to ensure safety.  He discussed the surprisingly good cell service in remote areas and the dilapidated infrastructure left from Belgian colonialism, including an overgrown hotel and a massive abandoned research center.  The conversation transitioned into a vulgar debate about gun control in the United States, sparked by the guest's experiences abroad.  The Boston Marathon bombing investigation and the Second Amendment were discussed alongside numerous crude jokes and tangents, with Jim Norton adding a humorous bit about prank show ideas for NBC involving newborns and their parents in a maternity ward.

The show concluded with two main segments. The first involved a comedic brainstorming session for a morbidly humorous TV show about a family whose children die in improbable, darkly comedic accidents.  The second, and longer, segment was a recap and airing of audio from the show's "First Annual Gay Off," a contest involving heterosexual men and their wives engaging in increasingly homoerotic acts until a winner remained.  The audio detailed the escalating challenges, including excessive tickling, lap dances, armpit kissing, and "asshole sniffing," with contestants' discomfort juxtaposed against the hosts' gleeful narration.  One contestant, Sal, quit, while another, Troy, showed greater enthusiasm.  The hosts reflected on the absurdity of the event, considering it a highlight of 2013 and mentioning a planned sequel.  The show also included a Valentine's Day-themed contest involving a male performer, "Gogo Harder," and several male contestants, featuring increasingly explicit acts and culminating in a 90-second freestyle challenge to arouse Gogo Harder.  The hosts provided detailed descriptions of the acts, using highly vulgar and offensive language throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shocking admissions.  James Lipton.  A pimp is somebody who exploits the women who work for him.  I was a tour guide. I would say, you want to see some sex?  Shitface buffoonery.  Iraq drank all the Patron.  Everything is blurry.  And whatever this is.  Normally I like a couple fingers up my ass.  What the fuck happened?  Relive six months of ONA in just one short week.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  No.  Welcome to day five of the worst of 2013 so far with me, Sam Roberts. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony are ending their week-long vacation back on Monday with live programming.  However, before that, we'll finish off this great week of highlighting the best moments that have happened this year so far  by hearing things like Anthony Bourdain, Liberace's boyfriend Scott Thorson,  and of course, today will be the day we relive the gay off. 
[00:01:00]  Hide your kids.  Hide your wife.  It's going to happen.  Before all that, actually this just happened.  We met a guy.  Well, we found him on YouTube and he ended up calling the show.  Named Max Cook.  Who does a spot-on Tony Soprano impression.  Well, James Gandolfini died.  It was a very sad day for everybody.  But especially for the guy who does all the Tony Soprano impressions on YouTube.  He lives in California.  So he calls in at like 6.30 a.m. East Coast time, which is 3.30 in the morning his time. 
[00:01:30]  And he's all fucked up on Ambien.  He calls in as Tony Soprano and is just making sense and nothing.  Very weird phone call from Tony Soprano.  Beyond the grave.  I'm the worst of 2013 so far.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013.  So far.  Hi, who's this?  I fucking died.  Oh, no.  It's not what I fucking wanted.  I'm 51 fucking years old.  What, are you fucking kidding me? 
[00:02:00]  I still had fucking work to do down here.  Fucking shattered.  And I'm glad I died in Rome.  It's kind of poetic if you look at it.  Jeez.  Wow.  Wow.  What happened?  Let me tell you something.  I'm a gluttonous son of a bitch.  But more than that, there might be other elements.  Things I can't talk about.  I'll tell you one of the first thoughts I had when I heard he was dead. 
[00:02:30]  Is, fuck, I should have come back that day and met him.  Because he was here one day at 3.  And I was doing something legitimate for work.  But I remember going, I want to go back and meet him.  But I think I couldn't.  And I was like, fuck, I was so mad.  Right.  And I was like, God, I wish I would have come back and met him.  So you automatically think of my little being affected by it.  Right.  It's such an unimportant thing.  I'm glad I never met you.  I've got to be honest.  Everybody thinks I'm a four-loving guy. 
[00:03:00]  I'm fucking not.  Leave me the fuck alone.  I'm miserable.  That's another thing that Gandolfini probably would have said exactly like that.  Exactly.  Look, I appreciate it very much.  But can you back the fuck away?  You're invaded my personal space.  I'm in no mood.  What are we going to do without Gandolfini?  It's panic.  What are you going to do?  You're going to fucking shit your ass down and shut the fuck up.  I think a lot of people will be seeing your YouTube videos in the coming days. 
[00:03:30]  Because now they're going to be searching out all sorts of Gandolfini stuff.  Yeah.  You know?  I was only 51.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Doesn't make any fuck of sense, huh?  I just had a little girl.  Now what?  I never wanted to be one of those deadbeat dads that's not around to take care of the kids.  I got to tell you something.  This really fucking hurts. 
[00:04:00]  I was having a good time, even though it was a bit of a crank.  What did Brad Pitt say?  Is he all right?  Nah, he's really upset about your passing there.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  He's got a lot to be upset about.  Look at him with his zombie movies.  His long blonde hair.  His Adonis.  He's a good guy, though.  I got to say, I enjoy playing off of him.  I did a couple of movies they got to give him me.  He sounds just like that. 
[00:04:30]  Oh.  Man.  Man is right.  What do you have to say about all the people that are really, really, really sad?  I don't know.  I feel really bad for him.  Then again, I'm sort of floating around in these vapors here, and I don't know what's going on yet.  I mean, I can't tell you there's life after death.  Because I don't know yet.  Give a man a minute.  But it's not like you're boarding a cosmic train. 
[00:05:00]  Fucking Ambien.  Well, did you see the light?  People talk about the light.  People talk about the light, don't they?  I saw AJ.  I saw Meadow.  I saw Carmela.  I saw them young.  And then as I started to ascend further up into the sky, they started to get older.  And then I saw babies.  I didn't recognize them.  It's very weird. 
[00:05:30]  And then it's like that night at Holston's.  When everything went black.  And it's you dead of me.  I don't want to fucking be dead.  I want to watch my little girl grow up.  This sucks.  Jesus.  Not to mention all the food I'm going to miss.  The food and the beverages and the lifestyle.  I got very comfortable. 
[00:06:00]  I got a lot of respect.  But I was tortured.  Come on.  You gotta be pretty fucked up to play a part like that.  Tony Soprano.  At least you'll see Christopher when you're there.  Fucking A.D.  Welcome.  Get your fucking ass up here right fucking now.  And let's go for a fucking ride.  Oh yeah.  I'm going to miss him. 
[00:06:30]  What about AJ?  I mean, you think AJ's going to be all right with your passing there, Tony?  I don't know.  I'm going to be fine.  I want money.  I want money.  I've been saying that all day.  Just walking around my house.  I want money.  The eyes really wide.  I'm going to be fine.  It's not fair.  I knew he would die eventually, but not like this.  So now what? 
[00:07:00]  I don't want to lose my bedroom.  Oh my God.  I did write a script a couple weeks ago, which is really eerily about this.  So it makes it even more compounded now that it's all going down.  What was the script about?  It's basically Carmela telling T he's got to go because he's dead.  And he's got to let go because he goes to the fridge and there's nothing in there for him. 
[00:07:30]  He doesn't understand.  Tom, what the fuck?  You got to keep the meats on tap.  What's with the fucking yogurt?  No, I'm going to go.  She says, you got to go.  Oh, yeah?  Why?  I live here.  She's like, no, you don't.  You don't live here anymore.  You got to go.  Where am I going? 
[00:08:00]  What am I doing?  I'm fine.  I can take care of everything.  I've got it covered here.  I've made changes in life.  I can do it.  But you need to get out of here.  Okay.  What if I'm scared?  Well, it's going to be okay.  You're not going to go to hell.  I'm not going to tell the whole thing, but it's that.  Oh, wow.  We was on the phone.  It's amazing.  Sounds amazingly like I'm very, very creepy now. 
[00:08:30]  It is creepy.  Now it's creepy.  What's even creepier is that we get a call from Gandolfini from the afterlife, and some  ass keeps showing up and taking the phone from him.  Okay.  You got to go.  But they don't want to hear you.  They want to hear me.  I know.  I know they do.  But you're very upset.  And you're on Ambien.  No, you're on Ambien.  Now you're going to go listen to his skin cell talk. 
[00:09:00]  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  Again, creepy.  Yeah.  You need to work on the Carmella voice.  Anyway.  Fellas, I got to say, you do a good job over there.  I just hope everyone's getting along.  I hope those serious bathrooms are clean enough for you.  I hope at night you're going out, and you're having some beverages, and you go home to your  families, because that's all it's about.  It's also about watching horror movies. 
[00:09:30]  What?  Horror movies?  Horror movies are good.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I like watching horror movies, because everyone's a fucking asshole in a horror movie.  You can cathodically watch them all fucking die in horrible, violent ways.  So by the end, you're tired, you've seen a lot of death, a lot of blood, and you feel  pretty good.  Max, thank you, brother.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, guys.  A salute. 
[00:10:00]  All right.  A salute.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It gets worse.  More of Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013, so far, coming up.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013, so far, continues right now.  Hit it now.  Now.  Hey, it's Sam Roberts, and this is the worst of 2013, so far.  While Opie and Anthony are on vacation, we've been highlighting all the great moments that 
[00:10:30]  have happened this year, so far, anyway.  Scott Thorson, did you see the Liberace movie?  It was on HBO.  You know the guy that Matt Damon played, Liberace's boyfriend?  The real-life dude, Scott Thorson, came on to the show this year and was just talking  everybody's business.  My God.  From Liberace to Michael Jackson to Charles Manson.  This guy had something to say about everybody.  Is he telling the truth?  I don't think so, but you might. 
[00:11:00]  Be the judge for yourself.  Don't take my word for it.  It's Scott Thorson on the worst of 2013, so far.  Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013, so far, on the Opie and Anthony channel.  What did you think of Matt Damon playing you?  I thought he was fantastic.  Are you happy?  Yeah.  Very happy.  The movie's number one.  It's the number one movie since 2004.  It's the...  Freakspiel.  Yeah.  Freakspiel.  Oh, it did crazy numbers.  What do you think about Matt Damon pounding Mike Douglas? 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  I'm a fan of both.  I like them more now.  I thought that was great.  Is that how you gave him a pounding, huh?  Catherine's got to be jealous.  Was anything like what you did to Liberace?  Well, I didn't do it quite that hard.  He was a little older, you know.  Yeah.  At the time.  Was that true, though?  Was he really like...  Because that might have saved your life.  Like, the fact that he wanted...  You wanted to fuck him, and you didn't want him to fuck...  Yeah.  I didn't...  He didn't fuck me, and I didn't fuck him.  Oh, you didn't fuck him.  He blew you, though, right?  He blew me.  Wait a minute. 
[00:12:00]  Wait, wait.  What?  Oh, man.  You weren't having anal sex with him?  I thought you were.  You were the giver.  I think just once.  Oh, they copped her once.  No, just once.  But it was always protective sex, and I think that's the reason why I was alive.  But he blew me.  I never blew him, though.  You never blew him?  Oh, man.  You never blew the barrage?  No.  Come on.  What kind of a friend are you?  He had an ugly cock.  It was full of...  What do you call it?  Silicone.  Was it?  He siliconed his dick up? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  And how...  It was all lumpy, and he was uncut, and it was ugly.  Wow.  He had an uncut, lumpy, silicone cock, and he couldn't get it hard.  Oh, damn.  Because of all the silicone.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  We got it.  How big was it lengthwise?  About that long.  No.  Was he really that long?  Yeah, he was big.  Are you serious?  But he was Italian, that's why.  You know what they used to do?  And the heck, they did this to John Bobbitt, I think, when Ron put him in that movie.  But he wasn't bigger than me, though. 
[00:13:00]  They cut that muscle.  They cut the muscle so it just kind of hangs.  Under the vein.  It gets a lot longer.  Well, don't they pull it out a little bit more, too?  You got a little extra in there?  It makes it longer, then they shoot it up with a silicone.  You cut the ten, and then you can pull it actually out to make it longer.  Yeah, like John Bobbitt, when they shot him up with all this stuff, it looked like a lumpy red bull cam.  Oh, man.  Now it's easier.  You can use the cock pumps.  They work great.  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they do work.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Dick pump works.  But his dick was long and silicone and lumpy, which meant that it wasn't silicone properly. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah, and uncut.  Oh, you don't like uncut?  No, no.  He is ugly.  Lee's ugly dick.  When you can't pull the skin away from the head, yuck.  Oh, God.  Oh, GMI, Scott.  No, no, that's phenomenal information.  Oh, gosh.  Just enough information.  That's J-E-I, yeah.  Just enough information.  So he would suck your dick, and what would you do while you're sucking your dick?  Just think of somebody else, or would you...  Yeah, just close and fantasize.  Would you really not?  You never fucked him?  Come on.  Never once?  Just once?  I think once I started you, and I didn't like it. 
[00:14:00]  What didn't you like about it?  I was only 16 years old.  Come on.  Oh, you were that young?  Yeah, I was young.  How did he get off then?  Like, what was in it for him?  I guess he just jerked.  Yeah.  He had one of those bags that he would use.  One day I caught him using it, you know, when he came in.  What's the bag?  He quickly pulled it up and threw it in the drawer.  I didn't know.  It was a pump bag, and he was sitting there pumping it, and I was watching.  He didn't know I came in.  I was watching.  And that's when he had his wig off, and he threw it over the shower. 
[00:14:30]  I've got to tell you a funny story.  Please.  He flushed an ounce of my cocaine, right?  And I got so fucking pissed off that I chased him down.  Now, this house is 17,000 square feet.  Jesus.  Anyway, he was running for, and I really didn't mean to, but I grabbed him by the back of the  hair, and I pulled the wig off.  Oh, Scott, you're such a bad boy.  Were you sleeping with other people at the time?  It was he, or were you? 
[00:15:00]  No, just Michael Jackson, you know.  Now, did you really sleep with Michael Jackson?  Yeah.  How did that happen?  Well, I met Michael in the mid-70s, and I was introduced to him by Liberace, and we just  had a great relationship.  Look at Lee and I broke up in 82, so Michael asked if I would come and work for him.  So this is when he was breaking up with the Jacksons, you know, his brothers, and he went 
[00:15:30]  solo, and this is when Thriller came in, and then we went to Europe, and we did Say Say  with Paul McCartney, Big Hit, and all that, and we just hit it off.  Michael fell in love with me.  I was a pretty boy back then.  Were you the giver or the getter there?  No, he was the giver.  Michael was?  Michael was, yeah.  He was the giver?  Yeah.  I was very, you know something, and I'm glad that I was that way because of the AIDS epidemic  back then.  I mean, it was bad.  You know, Rock Hudson, and you know, I saw Rock a week before he died. 
[00:16:00]  Lee and I went over to see him, because Rock and him used to fool around years ago.  Oh, boy.  And then they'd have all the sex parties over there.  Boy.  Boy, boy, boys.  How long did you know Michael before it became sexual or became apparent that he wanted to  be sexual with you?  Well, it wasn't until 82, and then we were together until about 85.  And then when he started getting really big, he decided that, well, we better cool this,  and then I went my way. 
[00:16:30]  Did you guys do a family road trip with the plastic surgery or something?  Oh, yeah.  I've got to tell you the funny story.  Liberace had a full facelift.  I had my cheek implants and the chin.  Michael wants to get his nose done.  No, excuse me.  I'll back up.  I had gotten my nose done, and Michael loved it.  And he hated his nose because it was wide and looked like Joseph.  He reminded him of his father. 
[00:17:00]  And Michael didn't have a good relationship with Joseph.  So all three of us are bandaged up in the backseat of the Limo Rolls Royce that Lee drives  on stage, going to Palm Springs, and then that crazy doctor, which Rob Lowe calls.  Right, right.  That was great.  We're shooting us up full of Demerong and pharmaceutical cocaine and bifetamines.  And this is how Michael starts his plastic surgery and starts the drug addiction by pharmaceutical 
[00:17:30]  drugs.  Wait, can I ask about the Michael Jackson thing?  Did the family ever try to sue you or anything?  Because obviously...  Well, let me tell you.  When I released this article in 2004, Alan Butterfield, the editor of the National Enquirer,  flew in two experts and ex-FBI agents and did polygraph tests on me.  I passed two polygraph tests. 
[00:18:00]  One was offered to Michael because they were protesting on it.  Michael refused to do it.  But the Jacksons have never come after me.  Now, of course, they say, well, oh, no, it's not true.  But I mean, I've never been sued.  I did hear from the attorneys in the beginning.  And then they backed off once I, you know, the lie detectors came in.  And then when Michael refused, they told Michael not to do it, obviously, because Michael,  it was true.  And this goes way back. 
[00:18:30]  You know, Liberace called me a fucking liar, a disgruntled employee.  I was a hustler.  I was a porn star.  I walked off the streets of Hollywood.  And I had, you know, I was nothing but a liar.  They even paid my brother, Wayne, who passed away, my half-brother, over $20,000 to testify  and make up stories about me.  And, you know, they were just a piece of shit back then.  Right.  I got one more question.  What do you think of Michael and the kid thing? 
[00:19:00]  Your opinion.  Yeah, it's not.  Those aren't Michael's kids.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Michael with the allegations.  Oh, no, no.  Michael didn't do that.  See, a lot of people say that.  It was just that he never really grew up and just felt more comfortable hanging out with  younger people.  Michael would never do that.  He was acquitted for it.  That's interesting.  And it was this kid, the kid, I forget the kid's name, but the uncle is the one that,  you know, got the $20 million from Michael. 
[00:19:30]  And so Michael decided, and this came right from Michael.  He was afraid.  So he paid this guy $20 million because he was going to expose him.  Expose him as?  As a child molester.  So Michael paid him off.  But if Michael wasn't a molester, what was he scared of?  Well, he didn't want the bad publicity.  That's just like Liberace didn't want the bad publicity about me being 16 years old.  You know, we settled out of court and all that. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, you did settle.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  I'm having a hard time getting my head around Michael being a giver.  Yeah, that really did sound a little...  Now, give me this again.  Michael was the giver.  Yeah, yeah, he was.  Seriously.  He was more of a top and a bottom.  That's an odd thing.  That struck me as odd, too.  I figured he'd be a wimpy little...  I know.  I have to change everything I think of now when I jerk off.  But, I mean, he got into oral sex and all that.  But, I mean, he had a crush on me. 
[00:20:30]  I mean, I was young.  And then I got all the pictures to back it up when Michael and I were at Lord Montague's  and, you know, at Buckingham Palace.  And I'll tell you a funny thing that Michael and I did.  You know, outside the Queens, you know, in the castle, these guards stand straight.  They're not supposed to move.  Yeah.  So, what we did was we kept putting a...  Well, we put about five grand on the bayonets.  And we kept loading it up with money and pounds and all that.  And we said, now, you can keep this, but we need a picture. 
[00:21:00]  And sure enough, he moved and he grabbed the money.  And they're not supposed to do that.  And I sold it to the National Enquirer for ten grand, too.  So, I got back the money.  Scott was involved in the Wonderland murders.  Right, right, yeah.  With John Holmes.  That's the John Holmes thing.  Yeah, and then I got gunned down and shot at the contract place.  I mean, I was shot five times.  So, let's go with Wonderland.  You knew John Holmes or who?  You were there with John?  I knew them all.  I knew...  Well, here's what happened. 
[00:21:30]  In 81, I took some of my money and I invested it with Nash because he owned a bunch of nightclubs.  Eddie Nash.  Yeah, so he owned like 15 Kit Kat clubs, you know, where the girls would come down in the cage and strippers.  And then the Club Hollywood, Starwood, Seven Seas, Club Hollywood, The Odyssey.  Anyway, to make a long story short, is that Holmes, we would party with Holmes up there at Nash's place. 
[00:22:00]  Nash hooks Holmes on crack cocaine.  The plastic surgeon, my plastic surgeon, or Liberace's plastic surgeon, shoots himself in the head.  So, I needed...  Wait, the Rob Lowe character shot himself?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Jeez.  So, I needed a new drug supplier.  Well, Nash brought in all the heroin, cocaine, plus he had Mayor Bradley, Tom Bradley, on his payroll.  A couple of DEA agents.  Anyway, Holmes sets up the robbery. 
[00:22:30]  Leaves the back door open.  They come in there and they stick a gun down Eddie Nash's throat and make him beg.  And they took over a million dollars worth of drugs, cash, and jewelry.  Well, I'm in Tahoe.  We're performing at the Sahara Tahoe.  I take a liter jet back to pick up a pound of cocaine and some cash because I was collecting from the clubs.  Well, in walks, he just had the robbery, maybe a couple hours before I got there. 
[00:23:00]  Well, when I come there, Gregory Diles, his black bodyguard, brings in Holmes and they find out that Holmes set up the robbery.  And they beat the shit out of Holmes.  And they ordered...  And I was there when Nash gave the orders to have these people killed.  And they used Liberace's Bill Blass Lincoln to drive Holmes up there.  And he participated in some of the killings up there, John.  Wow.  Now, what was the killing? 
[00:23:30]  And there was the robbery.  And then what happened...  Can you walk us through that?  Because Eddie Nash's house was robbed.  Yeah, it was home set up.  It was robbed.  And then...  So what they did was they found out who was responsible.  Oh, the actual bird.  And then they were called the Wonderling Gang.  Okay, up in Laurel Canyon, there's a street called the Wonderland Avenue.  So that's why it's called the Wonderling Killings, Laurel Canyon.  And so they ordered...  Nash ordered these people executed. 
[00:24:00]  And they actually killed the wrong people.  One guy was there, but they killed all the girlfriends.  You know, so they killed four girls and one guy.  Or was it three girls and one guy?  And then there was a count of attempted murder.  So there was four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.  Well, you know, the famous homicide detective that handled this case, that handled O.J.  That fucked up O.J.'s case, Tom Lang. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, wow.  That was him?  Yeah.  And so, anyway, to make a long story, I testified.  Nash puts a contract on me because he starts smoking that crack and gets all paranoid.  And the next thing you know, I have a contract placed on me.  I go to Florida and I get gunned down and shot.  So I testified.  Nash gets a hold of one of the members of the jury.  Eleven of them came back with guilty plea, found them guilty.  One was not guilty. 
[00:25:00]  Then back in 99, the feds then decided, well, we're going to go after him for money laundering,  racketeering.  So they brought the murders back because normally you can't double jeopardy.  You can't do that.  But anyway, they did a deal with him.  He pled guilty to conspiracy to commit murder on the Laurel Canyon and also for jury tampering.  The one lady that I told Dale Davidson and all the other district attorney and the U.S. attorneys that he got to me. 
[00:25:30]  And so there was a jury fraud and then a $250,000 fine.  He only spent 33 months in prison.  Can I ask where you were when you got shot?  You said you were in Florida.  Yeah, yeah.  What happened there?  What was that moment like?  What were you doing?  Well, what happened was I went on the Federal Witness Protection Program and I was so fucking bored.  I mean, these guys, they take you to the Looney Bend. 
[00:26:00]  I mean, way out in the sticks.  I mean, come on with my life.  So what I started doing was running cocaine and the perfect thing I could do was running it with the federal marshals in their car and going through the airport.  They never checked me.  And then I became a preacher.  I did the Billy Graham.  I did the Pat Robertson.  I became, yeah, I said, oh, the, you know, the horrible sins of Hollywood.  And they ate it up.  They loved it.  Were you being sincere?  Huh? 
[00:26:30]  Were you being sincere?  For a while.  Then after I found out how the politics in those fucking churches, I mean, they were horrible.  Especially some of this.  He goes to the Witness Protection Program, right?  So nobody can find you and kill you.  He gets five bullets in them, right?  And then he decides, well, you know, I kind of like the celebrity thing of Liberace, so I'll just be a minister.  Yeah, but I want to know about the day you got shot.  Yeah, what were you doing in that moment?  What were you doing where you were surprised, like, oh, fuck, they found me?  Well, I was in a hotel in Jacksonville, Florida. 
[00:27:00]  And they come in, they shoot me in the head, the hand here, because I put my hand up.  It went through here and came out there.  Yeah, there you go.  Wow.  And then right above the left nipple, they shot me, penetrated the heart.  And then I took three bullets through the abdomen.  Wow.  With a .38, up close, right from where Dennis.  But, you know, I kept getting up.  You know, I was pretty big back then.  And I managed to break one of their, you know, kept fighting.  And then finally I said, I better lay down.  You know, I was running out of blood then. 
[00:27:30]  So you got shot in the head, the heart, and three times in the stomach.  Yeah.  And what kind of abdomen damage did it do?  Because the stomach seems like a, you know, a motherfucker.  Well, the big thing was is I was paralyzed.  It went into my spine.  Jeez.  And then I became paralyzed.  And then they, the doctors only gave me about 2% chance to live that day.  And then I became, I died.  And they brought me back after like almost 15 minutes, I was pronounced dead.  Wow.  What do you see?  Anything?  And, uh.  Do you see the light? 
[00:28:00]  No.  I saw the devil.  I saw Liberace, he did cock.  The big lumpy.  But I had to learn how to, you know, talk and walk and eat again.  Because I went into a coma.  And then they couldn't, when they were cutting me open, they only paralyzed me.  So I wouldn't move because my blood pressure was so low.  So I felt all that cutting through the bones and pulling and ripping.  So, I mean, this is what, uh, you know, makes movies and, and books. 
[00:28:30]  We noticed that you're wearing a lot of jewelry.  Yeah.  Whose, whose is that?  That's, uh, some of the gifts that Liberace gave me.  That's why I was wondering.  It looks like it was.  These are some of the ones that I, I didn't pawn.  Yeah, yeah.  And they threw me out.  So you were, you were worth a lot of money at one point after Liberace, right?  Oh, yeah.  But you see, the Nash got it all.  Well, no, the federal government got it all.  Because when Nash, uh, uh, the killings, they cracked down, they closed every fucking club.  They took the property for income tax, IRS. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, there was no way you were getting your money from them.  No.  And you went through, and you obviously went, you went through a lot of your money.  Oh, well, yeah.  Did you behave fiscally irresponsibly?  I was irresponsibly.  Well, come on, you know, you gotta, you gotta realize, you know, I, well, all those years  with Lee, and Lee, I mean, you know, he'd spend a million dollars a week on me.  I mean, buying me homes and furniture.  We were in, in, in, uh, Buffalo, New York, and Lee comes out. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, or no, uh, the manager that owns the theater there, he had a beautiful, uh, 1962  Silver Cloud Rolls Royce, all gold, and, and with black tinted, I said, oh, I, I love that.  Well, my 21st birthday was, um, the following week.  Well, Liberace brought, uh, Baron Hilton had designed the, you know, the, the, he took the  garage out and made a big casino out of there.  And, but anyway, before he took the doors off, he, you know, he had that car in there 
[00:30:00]  with a big box and ribbon on there, and then a little box that had the gold Rolls Royce  key in there.  And, I mean, that, he, he was a very generous man.  Oh, man.  He was loaded, man.  How much money did Liberace have?  $250 million, $250 million estate, counting cash and real estate.  Wow.  Was it true that Hilton put a casino in your house and tried to get some of his money back?  Yeah.  Huh?  Well, they brought the, the casino.  Well, the main reason why, um, Baron, uh, supplied it with the slot machines and, uh, uh, the 
[00:30:30]  roulette tables was because of Frances Liberace.  She, she had a horrible habit of, um, hitting people with a cane and they were afraid of lawsuits.  So what they did was they, um, Baron, uh, loaded, uh, the casino, all the slots and the roulette  tables and all that.  So we had a private casino.  It was a beautiful home.  Seven.  Actually, he built that house for me.  It was, uh, five track. 
[00:31:00]  He bought the whole, whole block.  And it was a 17,000 square foot palace.  That's nothing but glass and mirror.  It was absolutely gorgeous.  You know, where they filmed all this was at Zsa Zsa Kavor's house.  Oh, wow.  At Zsa Zsa's house?  Yeah.  That was, uh, pretty impressive too.  Did he get to see her?  She's what?  Down to her head?  Yeah.  At this point?  They cut her leg off.  Oh, yeah.  She's been taking a body part every other year.  I think her husband's just waiting for that day to go.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  He's going to load up on everything now. 
[00:31:30]  He's amazed that she's lasted this long.  I don't doubt it.  Well, she's 90, 93, 94 years old.  Yeah.  But, you know, I don't, I mean, you know, I mean, she, and Zsa Zsa was the bitch.  You know who was the nicest one was Ava.  Ava.  Ava was so nice.  She'd come in with Merv Griffin.  What another queen that was.  Merv was.  Oh, my God.  Merv, yeah.  Well, you know, he loved Ava Kabor, and that was his front.  You know, she made all the public appearances. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  While he was, you know, at home sucking cock.  But, I mean, Merv.  Did you guys ever party with him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, Merv was one.  Oh, yeah.  He'd bring his little boy in and do their thing.  Did you guys do swappies and all that?  No.  Did Merv ever suck your penis?  Ava Kabor, pardon me.  Did Merv ever suck your penis?  No, but he could have.  I mean, he was more loaded than Liberace.  What happened to Liberace's house?  Is it still there?  Yeah, they have it up for sale.  They're trying to sell it for $375,000 now.  He put over $2 million now. 
[00:32:30]  That's it?  $375,000.  Yeah, but he built it in the $50,000 neighborhood.  Oh, shit.  Okay.  And now it's a drug-ridden area.  Oh, wow.  The museum.  Now, here's a great idea.  Wait, wait.  Liberace's house is in a bad neighborhood?  I never knew that.  It was always in a bad neighborhood?  Well, this was...  982 Shirley Street.  It's right off of Tropicana, across the street from the university there.  All bad area now.  Wow.  It's a drug.  And then the museum is on Tropicana, right below Maryland Parkway. 
[00:33:00]  I'm the one that put that museum together in 78.  I took everything out of the houses and put it together.  We bought the shopping center.  Of course, when I got in, when we broke up, he took all the pictures of me out of the museum.  But now, the museum is bankrupt.  See, the economy goes around.  Now, it's bankrupt.  Now, they were hoping that this movie would be successful.  So, what I would like to do is, Dennis and I are talking about this, is, boy, what a great idea that would be. 
[00:33:30]  He was putting...  Dennis has got 22 acres out there, horse stables.  He's got a gym, you know, $2 million gym out there.  He's got this beautiful bunny ranch.  Put the Liberace, now that he's got a history with me, put the museum out there.  I could tell the stories, then we can get a reality show.  Scott Thorson at the bunny ranch with a...  I'll put on a pink outfit.  I want to be in your cool boy outfit.  I'm going to make you a bunny boy. 
[00:34:00]  I want to make him a cool boy.  Or either he can start pimping me out.  I mean, maybe he can get $100,000 and I'll give him 50% of it.  I mean, come on.  I got to ask you about Liberace.  There's rumors that he tried to have you killed after he left.  Well, let me just say this.  I was beat up pretty bad in the penthouse.  This was done by Seymour Heller.  I was also threatened that if I went to the press, that I would disappear in Las Vegas. 
[00:34:30]  But, you know, I had balls back then.  I mean, I took a...  Here's a big, powerful man.  Around Michael's chin.  And, you know, Baron Hilton of the Hilton Hotels and all that.  Right.  You know, they threatened...  They told me to stay out of Vegas.  And that's one of the reasons why...  He even took my house back that he got me out there.  He says, well, I'll give you $75,000 for it.  Wow.  He says, but you're not coming out here.  I went out there anyway.  I terrorized. 
[00:35:00]  I just...  I used to throw eggs at his house.  Wait, wait, wait.  Oh, hey, and I went to prison, too.  I forgot to tell you guys.  Wow.  The prison story.  Yeah.  I went to work for the Mexican mafia cartel.  I got caught with five pounds of meth.  And I ended up in Corcoran State Prison.  But that was right at the time when I signed the deal with Weintraub.  So I went to prison with $50,000 on my trust account. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, my God.  And I had a ball in prison.  The best-looking guys.  And talk about crooked is the Department of Corrections because I bought all the drugs that I wanted.  So you had no problem getting drugs.  No, and they kept me...  I kept Charlie Manson company.  The worst is yet to come.  This is ONA's worst of 2013 so far.  On the O.P. and Anthony channel. 
[00:36:00]  O.P. and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  Far, far, far, far, far.  Continues right now.  Welcome back to the worst of 2013 so far.  All week long, we've been bringing to you the great moments that have happened on the O.P. and Anthony show this year.  And without fail, they've all been spectacular.  I'm Sam Roberts.  And when they give the show to me,  did you really think I was going to let the entire week of shows go by without bringing up professional wrestling? 
[00:36:30]  I think not.  WWE played a big part in 2013 on the O.P. and Anthony show.  So we put together a little montage.  Some memorable moments involving the superstars from the Dye W.E.  First was, of course, this one went everywhere.  It was WrestleMania week.  Fandango.  The wrestler who got O.P. and Anthony back interested in wrestling.  Surprise the guys in studio.  We'll play you that.  CM Punk.  We talked to him at WrestleMania Radio Row.  That's right.  We couldn't get to the Super Bowl Radio Row. 
[00:37:00]  But we got to WrestleMania Radio Row.  We talked to CM Punk.  And whether you like wrestling or not, CM Punk is just always an interesting guy.  And finally, The Miz.  The Miz's appearance on O.P. and Anthony was special.  Because Heather B., a fellow real-world alumnus, works in the studio across the hall in Swayze Studio.  So she stopped by and everything.  A great year so far for WWE superstars.  I wonder what's to come.  ONA's worst of 2013 so far. 
[00:37:30]  Well, we're sitting here.  We have the curtains closed.  Yeah, the curtains are closed.  And we're not watching porno, so something's up.  And Sam told us something's up.  There's a little surprise that's about to happen.  On its way.  The surprise is on its way.  I don't know why.  I'm thinking it's some kind of guest.  I'm thinking it's somebody that we've all kind of talked about.  Why would they just pitch a guest to us?  Because it's not pitch-worthy.  They know it's a yes, and they know it's not pitch-worthy.  That's a bold statement.  That's really...  Can you turn on mic seven, please? 
[00:38:00]  Uh-oh.  Why?  Are they going outside with a mic?  I just gave mic seven.  Wow, they're really...  When Travis wants mic seven.  Thank you.  Hold on, Sam.  Before the big surprise.  Could we pull a mic outside the studio?  It's Roland.  Roland is the big surprise?  Yes, it is.  By the door.  Sam, what's going on?  Hold on.  Roland's hard to get a hold on.  Hold on.  If Roland's here, that means it's a guest.  Okay.  Hang on.  You ready?  Hang on, Roland.  All right.  Are you ready?  Obi?  I'm trying to read your face. 
[00:38:30]  How goofy is this?  I'm just asking if you're ready.  I think you were right, by the way.  I still think you were right.  And that means he's a great actor.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anthony, are you ready?  Can I say what I think?  No.  No.  No.  You're just...  Don't drop.  Don't peek.  Oh, there's a film crew.  Don't peek.  Film crew, too.  Don't peek.  Jim, are you ready?  I am.  Sorry, but he's ready.  Yeah.  All right.  I told Anne who I think he is.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Then, Eric, hit the music.  Oh, man. 
[00:39:00]  He's getting to the play in.  He's lotioning up.  This is fantastic.  Oh, my God.  It's him.  Wow.  Oh, Jimmy's putting some lotion on.  Hold on.  Hold on, Jimmy.  Hold on.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Jimmy, can you do that again?  Come on.  Easy.  Come on.  Easy.  Easy.  What are you doing?  Oh, wow. 
[00:39:30]  Jimmy's oiling him down.  Oiling.  Thank you.  This is fantastic.  Look at the wonderful sequined vest.  Jimmy, you want to get his back?  Oh, get his back.  Oh, he threw his sequined vest at me.  I'm honored.  Jimmy's really getting into lotioning the lotion.  What?  What?  What's your name?  Uh, Jim, sir.  Okay.  Now, what's my name?  Fandango. 
[00:40:00]  Oh.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Fandango.  You need...  Johnny.  You need to feel it, Johnny, okay?  It's...  Fandango.  Knock the lotion over.  He knocks over.  Don't get nervous, okay?  No, no, no, no, no.  I'll try it again.  Try it again.  Fandango.  No. 
[00:40:30]  That was pretty good.  Jacob.  Jacob.  You got to feel it.  You got to let the A's breathe.  Fandango.  No.  You got to feel it.  Yeah.  Try it.  No.  It's your microphone.  Go ahead.  Fandango.  Duh. 
[00:41:00]  Go ahead.  Sorry, he's shaking his head no.  Come on, Jimmy.  No?  Not good enough?  What did I do wrong?  I will not come under this Mickey Mouse outfit of a show, okay?  Oh, man.  He's got that right.  Johnny?  Yeah, Johnny.  You just cost everybody here, you know, the hundreds and thousands of listeners across  the world the chance to hear the debut.  Oh, man.  A Fandango. 
[00:41:30]  Curly, this is what we're going to do.  This is what we're going to do.  Curly.  Sunday?  Yeah.  Okay.  Whoa.  These are real.  It's a real deal.  These are real.  How many?  Four.  Four.  Figure it out.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  Decide who wants to come.  Tickets.  Whoa.  WrestleMania just fell down your desk.  Whoa.  WrestleMania tickets.  Everything that goes down there is mine. 
[00:42:00]  You can see the real debut of.  Oh, of.  Uh-oh.  Everybody.  Everybody in the room.  Here we go.  Yeah, yeah.  And there he is.  There's the music.  There's the music, the dance.  I'm honored.  And now he's gone. 
[00:42:30]  That's it.  There he goes.  Strutting out.  That is wonderful.  I love it.  Wow.  And on goal.  Oh, look at this.  Whoa.  That is something right there.  All right.  That was cool and all.  Does he come back in now for an interview or no?  Oh, what are you kidding?  No, that was it.  Oh, nice.  We are going to WrestleMania, people.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's what you get.  We don't get the real interview now. 
[00:43:00]  Real?  You didn't say his name right.  No, I thought Jimmy did a pretty good job.  I thought Jimmy did.  I thought Jimmy did very well also.  I thought Jimmy did a great job.  I think he's using that as an excuse.  Not to wrestle.  To not wrestle.  Right.  You know, I don't know if anyone's brought this up, but I think he's using it as an excuse  to not wrestle.  Look, Jim did a pretty good job.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That doesn't make it right.  That makes it pretty good.  And that's not what...  He did it perfectly.  He did it perfectly.  He let the A's breathe and everything. 
[00:43:30]  I'm starting to think that he doesn't want to wrestle.  I'm thinking he doesn't want to wrestle.  He doesn't want to wrestle.  Well, we'll see him with Chris Jericho on Sunday, won't we?  And what do you think will happen?  I think Chris Jericho has his work cut out for him, quite frankly.  Oh, stop it.  Jericho's a pro.  Jimmy was lotioning.  I was lotioning Fandango.  You really were.  You really enjoyed that.  But this is what bothers me about myself.  At one point, I actually threw my headphones off so I could lotion the man properly.  Follow me. 
[00:44:00]  I think he's wearing underpants.  I wanted to lotion the man properly.  Chris Jericho never cared how his name was said before he got in the ring.  Right.  I think Fandango has a problem.  Did I do good?  Yeah.  At one point, he called you Jacob.  Yeah.  And he called me Johnny.  Johnny.  He's not good with names.  You don't think I did it well?  He did it.  I told them, you did it very good.  Yeah.  You didn't do it right.  Fandango.  Fandango.  What a great cop-out excuse this guy has. 
[00:44:30]  It really is a cop-out.  For not getting in the ring and mixing it up.  He just gets in there and says, you know, you didn't say my name right.  I'm leaving.  I'll be honest.  I felt those guns.  He's ready to wrestle.  I have lotioned the man up.  He's in fine physical shape.  He really was a fine specimen of manhood.  Yeah, he really was.  He's definitely not.  He's prepared to get into the ring.  Yeah?  Sure.  I can feel that, yeah.  I guess we'll find out Sunday.  And I've tussled with Jericho as well.  We shot something together where I had to throw him. 
[00:45:00]  He fell to the ground and I had to jump on him.  So what do you think?  Yeah, who are you going to be?  You're going to be at WrestleMania.  You've got the tickets now.  Well, hard to say.  I mean, I have to go with Jericho because he's a friend of mine.  Yeah, but you didn't ever lotion him.  That is true, despite many requests via email.  Right.  Well, the WWE is asking if you'll take a break so they can film your reactions to Fandango.  Oh, well.  Sure, of course.  That was a great surprise.  I nailed it, by the way.  I nailed it.  He did. 
[00:45:30]  I nailed it.  Right beforehand.  I never would have guessed it.  I'll be guessing.  And fucking Oscar winning Travis.  Yeah, because I go, Travis, I know what's going on.  And I said, he goes, nah.  That was good, Travis.  Thank you.  You got me.  Yeah, it was very subtle.  You just went like, nah.  Like, don't even think that.  I laugh so hard, I'm crying.  That is such a great fucking bit.  That music.  Yeah, that's why you couldn't go to the bathroom, because even though when he showed up, he was  wearing sweatpants, his sequin tights were popping out through the bottoms.  You have this video of me lotioning. 
[00:46:00]  I'm uploading a quick video from my phone of Jimmy lotioning up Fandango.  It was funny.  It was going to be available on my YouTube channel in a few minutes.  He kept saying, go with the grain.  Go with the grain.  That was quite the surprise for the Opie and Anthony show.  And obviously the fans basically saying, if ever you guys needed a visual element, just 
[00:46:30]  making our point over and over again.  Yeah.  Uh, Sam and Roland and the gang set up the Fandango.  Fandang.  I figured it out, by the way.  You got to do the G twice.  Fandango.  Oh.  You said it that way, too, by the way.  If you would have done that.  We did.  You probably would have.  We said his name perfectly.  He doesn't want to wrestle.  I'm not fooling around with this shit anymore.  The guy doesn't want to wrestle.  If you had said his name right, he would have stuck around and done an interview. 
[00:47:00]  I feel like I chased him out, because when I said go, I thought I did really well, and  then he left.  I felt like I ruined everything.  Right.  He did it a little wrong.  Did I?  I think he was fooling with you, too.  He said, you got the go right.  And I'm like, oh, finally, someone at least got part of it right.  And he said, and that's what I'm going to do.  Go.  I knew when you said he left.  I knew when you said we had a surprise, it was somebody kind of quirky that we've been  kind of talking about lately.  That was great.  Was it a stretch, though, that it was somebody that had to do with wrestling?  Yeah, right?  Yeah. 
[00:47:30]  That was hilarious.  And then we just filmed something for WWE.com.  We'll see if that makes it up there.  It'll go up there.  They were excited about it.  They are, huh?  Yeah, and Joe Vila, our guy over there, helped set it up.  But yeah, I was worried yesterday that, because Michael Cole, you know, he did the after show,  and you guys passed him in the hall.  But he talked to Opie a little bit.  Yeah.  And he had just found out that this was happening.  But I didn't know if he, like, I told him it was a surprise.  Right.  But when he ran into you, he goes, you brought up Fandango as soon as you saw him. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  I'm like, I'm in again.  Because I haven't really, I really haven't watched wrestling in a while.  I keep tabs on our guys that we like, like CM Punk and Chris Jericho.  The guys, Mick Foley, when he does his thing every once in a while.  You know, the guys that have been really good to us over the years.  Yeah.  But in general, I'm not a regular viewer, but the Fandango thing has got me back.  Yeah, it's just hilarious.  It's such a ridiculous gimmick.  But like Cole goes, you said, yeah, we're all on with this Fandango thing. 
[00:48:30]  Right.  And then Cole goes, yeah, I heard you guys.  And I go, oh, shit.  He's going to blow it.  And then he goes, we're talking about him.  I said, ah, I heard you guys are going to have him.  Right.  What does Mike Cole do?  He's the lead announcer.  He's the commentator.  Yeah, he does a very good job.  He's been there for a long time now.  He's the voice of the company.  I got to say, during the break, we got to meet him.  And for real, we got to meet the man that plays Fandango.  And he wants it known, I don't think I'm blowing up his spot, that he's a man. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, he's definitely a guy.  That is how he wanted to make sure every guy he talks to knows that this is his gimmick.  I'm not giving anything away.  He wants you to know, look, dude, looks a little weird, but I am a man.  He didn't say that, but he indicated he's just a guy.  Right.  He's a fucking dude.  He wanted to make sure you knew that.  And then he's talking about his father, who's a truck driver.  He's like, so, now you're Fandango.  Right.  His father writes him. 
[00:49:30]  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  I love it, though.  We're all in.  It's hilarious.  Oh, yeah.  That was an honor, getting our WrestleMania tickets from Fandango.  He's not doing any other press.  No.  He is a very entertaining guy.  I'll say that.  I'm looking forward to this.  I've never been to a WrestleMania.  This is going to be a lot of fun for all of us.  Especially all the guys we've interviewed.  We've interviewed almost everybody on the card.  Now we're being told we want to take the hotline. 
[00:50:00]  So, who's on the hotline?  Hey, nerds.  Nerds.  Oh.  Yeah?  It's Fandango.  Listen up.  I'm going to give you one more opportunity.  One more opportunity.  Hey, hey, hey.  Shh, shh, shh.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Shut him up.  I'm going to give you one more opportunity to get my name right.  Here we go, okay?  All right.  Try it again.  Try it again.  The Fandango.  He hung up on me. 
[00:50:30]  He just hung up on me.  He hung up on me.  It's like we're 12 years old today.  The gimmick is fantastic.  I know.  And there's a part.  I really want to get it right.  I want to be the special boy who got it right.  He finally gets it right.  Every single one of us got it right.  His entrance for WrestleMania is going to be fucking ridiculous.  So over the top.  He did a run-in on Monday.  Like he just interrupted somebody's match.  Of course.  And even when he was just interrupting a match, they brought down his big gold sequined curtain 
[00:51:00]  and played his music.  Why?  And he did it on Monday.  You guys would have laughed.  Now, you know how he's doing the dancing thing?  Yeah.  He went out while Chris Jericho was wrestling.  And every time Chris Jericho did a move, he held up a number that was low.  Like he held up like a three or a two or a zero.  It's such a great gimmick.  CM!  Yeah.  CM Punk!  Good morning.  Hi, buddy.  Sorry.  It's a little too early for that energy. 
[00:51:30]  I apologize.  It's what you guys are used to.  You work horrible hours.  Absolutely.  Can I give you guys an E-Rock update as we hear from CM Punk?  You know E-Rock, right?  Yeah, I remember E-Rock.  You guys can see me, right?  No, they can't.  No, they can't.  All right, never mind.  Why would we have a visual?  I don't know.  They were talking about how E-Rock completely just wormed his way into coming to this so  he could see wrestlers.  Which is weird.  E-Rock, you should have seen him.  I go, they're bringing guys out, E-Rock, so get ready to film or whatever. 
[00:52:00]  And I turn around, I see Punk walking to the table, E-Rock's nowhere to be found, and he's  running.  He has to run past Punk to get to the table on time.  He wasn't here.  Why?  I don't know.  There's bagels in the back, I think.  CM, I gotta tell you, that whole Paul Bearer angle is amazing.  I love it.  Thanks.  I freaking love it.  And we've been calling the shots from here going, he's gonna take those ashes and he's 
[00:52:30]  gonna pour them on The Undertaker, and you did just that the other night.  That is sick.  Yeah, I know.  It's like next level, right?  Yeah, because the guy actually died.  Yep.  In real life.  That bear is dead.  I didn't kill him.  And then having Paul Heyman come out as Paul Bearer was a nice little twist.  And Paul Heyman pulled it off.  Oh, absolutely.  He looked like, I don't know if you guys know who Sven Gulli is.  No.  He was this local, like, local campy, like, horror movie guy who, you know, like, would 
[00:53:00]  show horror movies and dress up.  He looked exactly like Sven Gulli to me.  It was kind of a throwback to my childhood.  Like Zacherli?  Right on.  Right.  All right.  And even though you're doing all this horrific stuff, you still can't really completely  turn the crowd, because they just love you, no matter what.  Well, I, you know, I'm the rotten human being I am.  I would cheer somebody if they dumped out somebody's ashes.  I think that's funny, you know, I would, I would go in and you guys would, too, you  know, so, you know, there's obviously that, that demographic of people who, no matter what 
[00:53:30]  I do, you know, it's, it's never going to be enough.  They're always going to cheer me.  That's all, you know, that's what every person wants to do.  And they see an urn with ashes in it as you just want to dump them on somebody.  Yeah, absolutely.  Nothing better to do with them.  So it was perfect.  Right.  Have you heard from Paul Bearer's family with this angle?  When I showed up in Indianapolis, which would be, it was like maybe three weeks ago, and  it was just a couple days after he had passed, his, his sons were there.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  And I, I talked with them.  I'm sure they were cool with it.  They, you know, they were almost falling all over themselves to make sure that I knew  that, you know, they were in constant contact with, you know, officials and that, you know,  whether they, he, he would have, he would have wanted the entire show to be dedicated  to him, which it was, you know, the big memorial and stuff like that.  And, you know, I think that was the night I wrestled Kane.  Right.  And I, I actually, I stole the urn.  So they were, they were on board. 
[00:54:30]  Nice.  Oh, good.  Good to hear.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they, you know, they, I, they, I think they get it.  You know, this is, this is pro wrestling, you know, like we want people to be outraged.  How excited are you to be doing WrestleMania in New York?  Oh, I think it's cool.  You know, I think New York's one of the, the better, uh, fan bases, obviously.  I mean, it's, it's sort of home for the WWE.  Right.  It, it started in the Northeast and, you know, this is always a, obviously when we do the  garden, it's a special event.  So this is, I mean, this is wild. 
[00:55:00]  I'm excited.  It's like in an outdoor stadium.  Well, Jim, Jim Norton's not excited because he thinks he's going to be cold or rain.  I know.  I'm going to have to wear my winter hat.  Yeah.  Just wear a nice, oh, your poor little dome.  And just wear it like a nice Patagonia jacket or like, you know, you'll be, you'll be warm,  Jim.  So now, uh, let me ask you people who like are really close.  Where did we get to sit?  Cause we're in the first section.  Yeah.  We're trying to figure out if, uh, if, uh, WWE actually took care of us or if they're  like going, ah, just give them these seats over here. 
[00:55:30]  We're not on the ground.  We're not on the, we're not on the, on the floor, as they say.  Oh, you're going to freeze your ass off then probably.  I probably will be, right?  Yeah.  Cause I think maybe, we can maybe stick you under the ring with Hornswald.  I think, I think the ring's actually going to be heated, which is interesting.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They want to keep the wrestlers all warm.  Maybe there's a chance the entire ring bursts into flames.  God.  I always hope.  When you, when you give people tickets, where do they usually sit?  Uh, well, I, that all depends on who it is and when they ask, because I got some, I got 
[00:56:00]  some real asshole friends who will try to ask me for tickets to WrestleMania like Sunday  morning.  Right, right, right.  And I'll be like, yeah, sure.  And then I'll purposely try to give them the most obstructed view, you know, for being  assholes.  Yeah.  But if it's a, you know, it's somebody I like, I'll stick them in the front row or whatever.  Yeah.  But to be fair, ONA didn't ask for WrestleMania tickets until like maybe two weeks.  Two weeks ago when they saw Fandango for the first time.  All right.  You don't have to tell.  And then they decided.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I know what Sam just did. 
[00:56:30]  That's why I'm, I'm shutting him down.  Why did you have to tell CM Punk that we're into the Fandango thing?  That's the only, I mean, see, I literally, they've said you, because you're fun to hang  out with and Fandango, because he's fun to watch, are the only things that are interested  in the WWE.  I think he's great.  Fandango's awesome.  I'm not going to lie, because CM Punk, you know, he's been an incredibly nice tour to  us.  I always take a look at what you're doing in the WWE.  I appreciate that.  And then Fandango, that whole bit kind of was funny to us. 
[00:57:00]  Sorry.  Have you seen, Sam, why are you apologizing?  I think it's great.  Have you seen the video of Fandango, of Jim oiling up Fandango?  No.  Fandango was in this week, and Jim lotioned him.  I lotioned him.  I did not oil him.  He handed me lotion and needed it applied, so I was a helpful boy.  Did you apply it to the front or the back, Jim?  It was only to his forearms and to the small of his back and a bit on his chest, wherever  the lotion was needed.  Well, Jimmy is just strange.  Jimmy's lying.  I didn't turn the camera on in time to see him lotioning his pecs. 
[00:57:30]  Did I lotion his pecs?  Yes.  Yes.  I missed that shot.  I did miss that.  But not his dick.  I didn't lotion his abs or his dick.  No.  You were too busy staring at his dick.  Remember?  He wasn't wearing other pants.  You know what?  It's hard not to stare.  He's got those high-waisted cock pants that are very, very popular.  And they're glistening, and they're shiny pants.  How do you not look?  I think Jimmy just tweeted.  Did you tweet the picture?  Of course I did.  Jimmy tweeted the picture, so it's Jim Norton on Twitter.  There's a great picture of Jimmy.  Staring at his dick as Fandango is kind of flexing at our door here. 
[00:58:00]  I wasn't staring at his dick.  My eyes were sleepy.  All right.  We just want to say hi, CM.  I'm sure Sam will do a real interview for the wrestling fans.  You and Chris are the main reason I'm going.  I really want to see you guys.  So it's my first time going.  I'm looking forward to it.  Cool.  Yeah.  Well, it's always a good time.  I mean, WrestleMania is ridiculously huge.  So even if you're not into wrestling, the spectacle of it all is pretty overwhelming.  It'll be fun.  You're going to love it, Jimmy.  I know.  I'm looking forward to it.  Yeah. 
[00:58:30]  All right.  Take care, brother.  Thanks, CM.  Good talking to you guys.  Right on, man.  You guys.  We're doing a real world.  Back to New York, season 10.  Back to New York, season 10.  It was season 10 back in 2001.  A decade ago, by the way.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  You know the original New York broad works here now.  No kidding.  I always forget her name.  She's really nice to us every morning.  Heather.  Heather B.  Heather B.  Heather B.  That's like from the original.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  That's like 20 years ago.  Exactly.  We say hi to her every morning.  She looks exactly the same.  She broadcasts right next door.  And did you know, here's another did you know. 
[00:59:00]  In 2000, when I was shooting The Real World Back to New York, I went to a comedy show at Caroline's, and you were there.  Oh, wow.  Was that?  I must have.  You were.  No, and here's you, Mitch.  Mitch.  Mitch Patel.  Mitch Hedberg.  Was I working with Hedberg?  Hedberg or something like that?  Hedberg or Patel.  Hedberg, I think.  I was working with Mitch Hedberg.  Something like that.  You don't remember working with Mitch Hedberg?  I knew him, so we worked together.  This was like 12 years ago.  Wow.  So, I mean, but I saw you, and I was like, this guy is incredible.  Like, you were the best out of everybody.  Oh, thank you. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, yeah, I don't remember that week.  I told you.  Hello.  Come and say hi.  From The Real World.  Yeah.  I don't think I've ever met her.  Actually, I think I've never met her working for you.  Yeah, I've never met her.  Oh, my God.  See?  It's nice to meet you.  My nephew told me all about you, and I was like, oh, shit.  We were just talking nicely about you, too.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm not so much.  Oh, man.  I always wave to them next door.  I've never actually been in here, and I heard you were in the building.  I was like, I've never met him.  A couple of real-world alumni.  I know.  This is crazy, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And we're old school, by the way. 
[01:00:00]  Like, well, she's old, old school.  I'm semi-old school.  Wow.  We don't think you're old, old school at all.  Well, I mean, she's the originator.  She's an original.  Yeah, she's an original.  Yeah.  So it's like, that's old school.  I mean, you know, that's original.  Yeah, yeah.  She's the founder of this thing.  Now, 28 seasons later.  Wow, it's like a fraternity.  Did you ever think?  It's like a fraternity, man.  You guys, I could see.  I know.  You've been through the experience together.  Thank you.  John Brennan always speaks highly of you.  Oh, my God, John.  Yeah, he speaks highly of you.  True story.  True story.  I know.  I do that a lot, too. 
[01:00:30]  But I just wanted to come and say hi.  I was so happy.  I just feel like we went to the same school or something.  Yeah, exactly.  It's almost like a family with the rear-wheelers and road rollers.  Every time you meet people, it's like, oh, my God, I was on the show.  I was like, oh, then we have something in common.  It seemed like everyone slept with each other, too.  Oh, my God.  No sex on my season.  No, no, no.  Really?  No, only the cast member got the director kicked off.  Becky, she got the director fired because she slept with him in Jamaica.  They tried to get us to go with some Jamaicans, but that didn't work out. 
[01:01:00]  Only the crew and the cast hooked up.  Yeah, none of our cast really hooked up, as well.  The only people that was hooking up was me, and I was bringing girls in.  And the weird part was, I don't know on your season, but on my season, we had cameras  in the rooms, and we didn't realize they were, you could see in the dark, because at that  time, by the way, that wasn't happening.  Like, it never happened.  And so, like, I remember, you know, watching it with my mother, and my, you know, just, 
[01:01:30]  you know, because we don't get advanced copies, you know?  Oh, no.  So I'm watching it on TV with everybody else, and Coral's like, Mike had sex in the bed.  And then it shows me, like, under the covers, like, you know, in that green, like, lighting.  And I'm like, and she's looking at, my mom's looking at me like, oh, my God, Michael.  And I'm like, Mom, I'm sorry.  I didn't know.  She told her it was fake.  Yeah, stop watching it, Mom.  But I was like, Mom, you have to admit, she's a pretty girl. 
[01:02:00]  So, I mean, at least you can be proud of me about that, right?  I just remember you being in love with Larry Johnson.  I was so in love with Larry Johnson.  I was excited.  Anytime I hear the name Larry Johnson, I instantly think of you because you became synonymous with Larry Johnson.  Are we talking about Charlotte Hornets?  Yes.  Yes.  Like, are we going?  Yes.  It was hilarious.  You went to the game, and you got to, like, and you're like, oh, there he is.  It was hilarious.  I had no idea what I was going to say.  I love sports, basketball and football in particular, and just fell in love with him when he was at UNLV. 
[01:02:30]  And it was an opportunity.  When they asked me during the audition, who would I like to meet?  I said, Larry Johnson.  And he said, who the hell is Larry Johnson?  And so, I said, I would go to a game when he comes to play the New Jersey Nets.  And when I saw him, I just said, I heard you wanted to meet me.  And our whole conversation started from there.  He was really nice.  I ran into him a couple of times.  Oh, really?  Afterwards, he was really nice.  And he's just been cool.  You know, I haven't seen him in a while.  Wow.  But I always tell him I'm famous now, too.  You know. 
[01:03:00]  So, it's all good.  That's great, man.  But I just wanted to come and say hi, Mike.  And it's really good to meet you.  I've never seen you in any reunion shows or anything.  So, I just wanted to say hi and congratulations with everything.  Well, it was a pleasure meeting you as well.  You too.  And good luck with everything.  Thank you so much.  All right.  Y'all take care of you.  All right.  Actually, popped in.  Take it easy.  Bye.  That's so cool.  You got to love SiriusXM, right?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  You never know who's going to pop in.  She's been really nice to us.  Oh, yeah.  I see her all the time and say hello.  I didn't know she was ever on a TV show.  The original real world. 
[01:03:30]  The original.  The originator right there.  That was the one that was like, wow.  Heather.  Heather, right?  Heather B.  She's very nice.  Her, Eric Neese.  Eric Neese.  Norman.  I remember these days.  And the little skinny white girl that was a dancer.  She would always like.  Mindy Cone?  That was her name.  Someone will get it down here.  I haven't thought of these names in a long time.  Maybe.  Maybe someone will get it.  They invite you to the reunion shows and all that, and you just don't do it, huh?  Well, not even that.  We even had one in a very long time. 
[01:04:00]  And any time they do, I've actually hosted some of the reunion shows for Real World and  Real World Challenges, but we just never cross paths.  I go to the reunion shows.  I'm not one of those people that I'm like, oh, well, I have to stay away because I'm a  new WWE superstar now.  Of course you go.  Then you look.  Oh, look what I did.  Look at me.  I'm a new superstar.  So what are you doing?  Oh, I'm a WWE superstar.  The Real World really got fucked up.  I mean, now they just get them drunk and they're in the house. 
[01:04:30]  But isn't that what you want to see?  You want to see that train wreck.  You want to see fights.  You want to see yelling.  But how long were you in the house?  Five months.  Now they're doing it differently.  They're doing barely a month.  Three months.  No.  The challenges are one month, but the Real World is three months now.  So they're still putting in some time.  And I was in New York City.  By the way, I was a college student.  I didn't have money.  And when you're in New York City, it's hard to get by on that college salary.  And they're not paying you when you're on the Real World.  They're not like, oh, hey, since you're on TV, here's money. 
[01:05:00]  Let me fill up the food.  They don't give you a taste?  No.  We had to pay for our own alcohol, too.  And I wasn't even 21 at the time, so I had to have a fake ID and everything.  They didn't give you a taste?  They didn't give you food?  No.  Nothing.  I had to buy my own food.  How do they justify that?  Because it's the real world.  You're living like you would in a real situation.  It's not like, you know, it's as real as real can be on TV.  Yeah.  Julie Gentry.  Julie Gentry. 
[01:05:30]  Very good.  That's Julie.  She was, I remember her dancing to that.  It's a wiggle it just a little bit.  And she's fucking like really going at it and shit.  I've no memory of that.  So that's how long ago?  20-some-odd fucking crazy.  I started watching the second season more than the first.  I think everyone has their season that they watch.  I was a real-world New Orleans fan.  Obviously, the one with Puck was great.  Puck was great.  It was amazing.  Yeah, yeah.  Puck and Pedro.  Puck and Pedro.  You put your fingers in the peanut butter, Puck. 
[01:06:00]  I'm not going to sit here while you put your fingers in the peanut butter.  I think that's like the most known line in real-world history.  You put your fingers in my peanut butter.  You pick your scabs.  And then you put your fingers in the peanut butter.  You pick your nose in your snot rockets.  And the kid was deteriorating right in front of your eyes.  Oh, no.  He did the guy?  Oh, God.  He died shortly after that season came out.  He was his age, right?  He had age of age?  Oh, yeah, man.  They had his T-cell count every week.  Oh, man, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:06:30]  There was good news and a lot of bad news.  And I remember being at a Black Crow show when they announced he died.  And it was shortly after that season was on TV.  Mm, man.  Yeah, no more than a year later.  Yeah, it was definitely sad and tragic.  But I think that's the first time that you saw a person with HIV or AIDS on national television.  And that's what the real world brought such new stuff to the table.  You realized they were real people.  Yeah, exactly.  It was the real world.  It touched your hearts. 
[01:07:00]  And then Los Angeles.  And then you came to me on the real world back to New York, running around naked and just doing whatever and getting into fights.  You know, it used to stand for something.  Yeah, yeah.  Now it's just drinking and fighting.  Mm-hmm.  More awkward moments.  Can you turn your head and cough?  Epic fails.  That was a shitty joke that barbed.  And fouled mouth rants.  Why don't you shut the fuck up?  Coming up, Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far continues next.  This is Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far. 
[01:07:30]  Talk about the language in, like, where they say, like, don't, he got in trouble for saying, I'm going to kill this guy or whatever it was.  He said, I mean, now you do stand up.  And what are you feeling about, because I know how I feel about the language policing that's going on in stand up with the obsession over terms and all this stuff that people are giving comedians?  Uh, well, I think, um, it depends.  I mean, I assume you're talking about offense. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, or what people find are offensive or inappropriate.  Well, offense isn't a case of right and wrong, is it?  It's about, it's about, um, feelings.  And feelings are personal.  Um, I think you've got to, you know, comedy comes from a good or a bad place.  You've got to know, you know, what side you're on.  Um, but, um, I can't believe it.  Now Roland's talking.  I know, Roland, he does that a lot.  It's rude.  Roland, he'll come in and dare people to look at him while he does it.  Um, so, uh, I mean, you have to take everything. 
[01:08:30]  When people say to me, they ask comedians this all the time, is there anything you wouldn't joke about?  Right?  Firstly, the answer's no.  There's nothing you shouldn't joke about.  It depends what the joke is.  Okay?  But people don't say that to writers.  They don't say to a novelist, is there anything you wouldn't write about?  Well, no.  So we know it's about how it's treated.  So they assume that, um, comedians treat things without, um, care, due care and attention. 
[01:09:00]  They're, like, not considered.  Like, they have no morality.  I see this all the time on Twitter.  Um, this, this, people who think that, uh, uh, they say things to me like, um, uh, so, are you never offended by anything?  I say, of course I'm offended by things.  But it's personal.  But what I'm offended about isn't the same as you.  You know, you can't, it's not objective.  And you don't want people penalised for being, for offending you.  You don't want them to get in trouble if they offend you.  Um, no.  Well, it, again, it, it, you have to be specific. 
[01:09:30]  You can't really talk in the nebulous because it's too difficult.  So, but, um, uh, so in my show, I deal, the, the, the big thing is that very often with, particularly with taboo subjects, which is what we're talking about, um, very often people mistake the target of the joke with the subject of a joke.  And they're very rarely related, particularly in comedy, particularly if it's mildly satirical, and particularly if it's a good comedian who knows what they're doing.  Um, so, uh, people's, um, they get stiff when you talk about, you know, race, disability, religion, okay? 
[01:10:00]  But wait, wait, because everything I deal with is, is in those taboo subjects.  And you, you talk about, like now, we're not trying to be funny, we're talking.  And so we're, we're using all those terms.  No one's, no one's angsty.  No one's going, but they're, because they know there's not a joke.  We know that we're discussing it.  And they know that, you know, you can talk about those subjects.  But when it comes to a comedian, and obviously, very often comedians aren't being themselves. 
[01:10:30]  They're being a heightened version, or they're being a provocateur, or they're trying to take the audience to places it hasn't been before.  And people get confused.  And I think that it comes down to people getting it or not.  And I, I sort of, I want to sort of say to people, you not getting my joke isn't my problem, really.  I shouldn't even be defending it.  I shouldn't even be talking about comedy as a comedian.  If the motive...  I should, you know, but I do, because I like to do it as an interest.  Yeah.  But I'm not talking about this as an expert or as a, as a professional. 
[01:11:00]  I'm talking about this as, as just a person.  Because I like, I like discussing these issues, and, you know.  And we all know the difference between, and this is what bothers me about people's fake outrage.  I don't believe the outrage.  Because we all know the difference in intent when someone's intending to make you laugh,  and the difference between that and when someone's making a serious statement.  Yeah.  There's a different intent and a different effect you want it to have on the audience.  Absolutely correct.  And they know that.  And they pretend they don't know it.  Well, I think comedy is a, as an intellectual pursuit.  So, and I think as soon as it gets emotional on purpose, i.e. with intention from the comedian, 
[01:11:30]  it stops being funny, and it stops being comedy.  It starts being rallying.  I mean, I've had, I've heard some comedians, so-called comedians come out,  and they say things like, um, what are we going to do about all these immigrants?  And it gets a round of applause from the audience.  Well, that's, that's not a joke.  Right, there's no punchline.  That's political.  That's just you putting your agenda across with like-minded people.  You know.  So, I'd say that, and then very often they say,  well, do you think that's so-and-so joke?  I want to say, well, it wasn't a joke. 
[01:12:00]  Mm-hmm.  You know, um, like Michael Richards going crazy.  Uh, you know, he was, he was stressed.  It's someone upsetting me, wanted to hurt that person's feelings.  Yes.  Right?  Uh, that wasn't comedy.  I think he stepped outside of comedy.  I'm not disclaiming it, because I'm a comedian.  I want to say, I think he did something other than comedy.  He was reacting angrily as opposed to being funny.  Definitely.  Exactly, yeah.  Yeah, well, he wasn't being a comedian.  He was being a bloke, who was a, he stepped out of character almost.  And we're all, we're always in character a bit when we're, you know, we're being a comedian. 
[01:12:30]  And we're wanting the audience to make that leap with us.  What, what about the idea, and somebody hit you with this on the phone earlier this week,  like the responsibility that you have for, because you're talking to an audience.  So, like, let's say the audience doesn't get your nuance, or doesn't understand what you're saying,  and takes the context of your joke and...  Well, but, well, I don't think you should legislate against stupidity.  Uh-huh.  Because there's only so many nods and winks to cameras before you're not doing anything special at all. 
[01:13:00]  If it, if everyone gets what you say, there's not much to get.  What, why do we want everyone to understand?  Why do we want to talk to a groom full of adults who have paid a hundred dollars the same as we talk to a five-year-old?  You know, you talk to a five-year-old because they have to get what you're saying.  It's important that they understand what you're saying without ambiguity.  With, with no frills, with no, with no agenda, with no, um, double meaning or level.  Don't, don't put your hand in the fire. 
[01:13:30]  Why not?  Don't, don't put your hand, do you understand me?  Don't put your hand in the fire.  Yeah.  That's not my job as a comedian, to tell them not to put their hand in the fire.  Not to fucking spoon-feed them, exactly.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yes.  You know, I, I, I, I've entered a contract here, and the contract is, I'll say what the fuck I like, and if you don't like it, don't come again.  Or just get up and quietly go, like, the people with the whole Tosh incident about the rape joke, and, it was like, that woman was wrong because she heckled.  Like, I, I thought that she had every right to get up and leave, because if you're not enjoying something, you should just leave. 
[01:14:00]  But not to take control of the show.  It's not your business to do that, because you wouldn't do it in a movie theater.  Let me tell you, if she was in a movie theater, and she was in, say, uh, or watching, uh, she wouldn't dare stand up and throw paint on the screen if she saw something she objected to.  Or she wouldn't put her hand in front of the projector so nobody else could see it, she would just leave.  But because you're in the room with her, people feel entitled to make you know their opinion.  Well, that's the difference, again, between freedom of speech and censorship.  Censorship, um, isn't turning off your own telly. 
[01:14:30]  That's up to you.  Censorship is making everyone else turn off their telly because you don't like what's on the telly.  And that's a big difference.  And I think people sometimes get confused with what freedom of speech is, you know.  Um, basically, I think offence is the collateral damage of freedom of speech.  Some people don't get offended by anything you say.  Somewhere, somewhere, they might not get it, they might not care for it, it might not be their cup of tea. 
[01:15:00]  And that's fine, you know, but they have the choice.  You know, as a comedian, I don't go around knocking on doors and sitting on people's surface and shouting my shit at them.  They've come into my world.  They've come into my church.  Do you know?  Yeah.  They're going to hear my sermon.  That was a great way, sorry to not understand, but that was a great way to phrase it.  Offence is the collateral damage of free speech.  That's a really good way to say it.  And people don't understand free speech either.  No, they don't.  They think that means you can do anything.  I say about freedom of speech is one of the most important things that we have in a civilised society, freedom of speech, right? 
[01:15:30]  And I have to explain to them, and I say, why do you block people?  I say, well, that's up to me.  Your freedom of speech isn't your freedom to be heard.  Right.  Or even if you're heard, listened to, or even if you're heard and listened to, taken seriously.  The freedom of speech ends with you saying what you want.  And it's the same principle as you saying that they came to your church. 
[01:16:00]  Like, if you're tweeting something out, you don't intend for the world to see it.  You intend for those who follow you to see it.  Exactly, yeah.  You've come to my door and you've complained about what I'm saying on my sofa.  Right.  It's my sofa.  Just leave quietly.  You don't have to do anything.  Just go home.  Just block me, whatever.  Right.  And by blocking...  And this is what an idiot says as well about freedom of speech.  And they say, oh, what?  So Hitler was right?  No, because he wasn't saying things, was he?  He was killing people.  Right.  That's not saying, that's doing.  Yeah, and his intent was not to make you laugh. 
[01:16:30]  It was to rally people to genocide.  Right.  Big difference between that and what...  Genocide is not covered within the boundaries of freedom of speech.  Right.  Yeah.  And, you know, if Hitler just went around saying shit, fine.  Yeah.  It's allowed.  If he just went around...  If the worst thing Hitler did was say awful things...  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay, he's a bit of an idiot.  I don't want to be his friend.  Right.  But...  He's allowed to say it.  As long as he doesn't put anything into action.  You're okay, Hitler.  Yeah.  You're okay with your funny little mustache. 
[01:17:00]  Don't do anything, though, will you?  No.  Okay, because he's illegal.  His first murder.  His first murder.  Oh, you don't have to set the mark there, mate.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's a line.  Oh.  You did it.  Yeah, but we're talking, you know.  There's another phrase that annoys me as well.  Militant atheist.  Militant atheist?  Uh-huh.  Well, you mean I said stuff.  That's what a militant atheist is.  Yeah.  I'm going to go onto a crowded tube station, unbutton my shot, and talk about science and  shit. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Horrible army.  Yeah.  There's so many things I want people to know.  What militant means.  What freedom of speech is.  Yeah.  What, what, um, oh, the burden of proof.  People, there are people who tweet me things like, you can't prove God doesn't exist.  No.  No, I can't.  Yeah.  Great.  No, I say things like, you can't prove Santa doesn't exist.  Like, I don't be so ridiculous.  Go on.  Well, that's insanity.  It's ridiculous.  Of course he does.  Man with a white beard doing shit in that time. 
[01:18:00]  Don't be fucked up bollocks.  You're great on Twitter, man.  You really, I love the fact that as famous as you are and as big as your career is, it's  like, you don't worry about saying the wrong thing and, and you don't, I love that you.  As long as you're honest.  Yeah.  You can't be held accountable, really.  Um, in that, that Tosh, what's his name?  Daniel Tosh?  Yeah, I didn't know about the joke or anything.  I, it was, it was raging and people were asking me, what do you think about Daniel?  I said, what's happened?  Said, uh, rape joke. 
[01:18:30]  It shouldn't be a rape joke.  There's no, you should never joke.  I said, well, it depends what the joke is.  I'm like, no, of course it doesn't.  You should never rape.  And then someone sent me a tweet and she said, I will laugh at a rape joke the day I know  that no one in that audience has been raped.  And I just tweeted back, what a strange door policy.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know about rape.  Two, please.  Oh, certainly that's, uh, can I just ask you a question?  Have you been raped?  I have, yeah.  You can't come in.  I'm sorry.  It's a party. 
[01:19:00]  It's not me.  There's a woman at the front and she's only going to laugh if she knows that no one in  the audience has been raped.  That was a great one.  Yeah, I remember that very specifically.  But like, but what an ass she is to say that because that means you won't laugh at a drunk  driving joke or you won't laugh at a pedophile joke.  Right.  Where you won't laugh at any type of domestic violence reference.  Also, what, what is a rape joke?  You know, I wouldn't, you know, I'm not, I don't find rape funny. 
[01:19:30]  It's not, it's terrible.  It's terrible.  It's one of the worst, heinous things that, um, but there's so many levels to get, I mean,  technically the door policy joke is a rape joke.  Well, if that's a, yeah, exactly.  I think.  Yeah, exactly.  I think, I think so.  I think, I think they mean the subject of rape.  Sure.  As opposed to the, you know, again, if you're laughing at someone who's been raped, that's  not a joke.  Yeah.  That's just, you're a horrible, nasty, but it, I don't find it funny.  There are some people that would find it funny, but they're serial killers and rapists.  Right.  Okay. 
[01:20:00]  And the, the thing is, again, stupid people, um, treat jokes about bad things with the  same fear and loathing as intelligent people treat the actual bad thing.  And they're not related.  You know, a joke about, that's what humour's for.  To, to get us over bad things.  That's exactly what, evolutionary speaking, a humour, so, it gets us over bad shit.  If you can't joke about bad shit, there's no point joking about good shit.  Yeah, because it's already happening. 
[01:20:30]  We don't need it.  We don't need it.  It's already good.  Everyone likes a balloon.  Who gives a shit?  It's like, laughter is this drug that cures bad shit.  It's a drug, it's a drug here.  It cures good shit.  I don't want that.  Yeah.  I like, I like good shit.  Yeah.  I want some of it that cures bad shit.  Well, laughter's the best medicine.  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  And, and you know what?  Those people, a lot of them aren't dumb, but a lot of them aren't dumb.  A lot of them aren't dumb.  A lot of them are, like, dumb is almost letting some of them off.  Some of them are dumb, but some of them are so self-centred in their opinion. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, exactly.  And there's a real self-centeredness that comes with it, and a self-importance about what I  feel is appropriate is appropriate, and what you feel is appropriate is not.  And I'm the arbiter of that.  Well, they don't, they don't, they don't, they don't like a comedian having this superpower  of freedom of speech and exercising it so well.  Right.  They can't stand it.  I mean, these are the people that go to comedy shows with the intent to catch you doing something  wrong, and catch you saying something you weren't supposed to, so then they can blog  about it, or they can, you know, tell the world that you shouldn't be doing what you  do. 
[01:21:30]  Yesterday, someone tweeted me, there is a cure for cancer.  It is called praying.  And I sent back, your application for chief of oncology at this hospital has not been  successful, right?  Sure.  So, so that's a clear joke about how stupid it would be if we took praying as a cure for  cancer seriously, as opposed to all that stuff that cures cancer.  Right.  That we've researched, right?  Someone gets involved saying, oh, so you're laughing at the fact there's no cure for cancer. 
[01:22:00]  Nope.  I'm laughing at you because you're a stupid fucking idiot.  Right.  So you don't get what I was saying.  Basically, he's angry on false pretenses.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I've had it happen to me.  Someone in the paper has said, look at this terrible joke, and they've done the joke,  and it's wrong.  They've got the joke wrong.  It's so important.  Yeah.  Every, every aspect of a joke is important.  The syntax, the semantics, the rhyming, sometimes even some of the visual aid that comes with it.  Taken out of context, it's, the better the joke, the more fragile it is. 
[01:22:30]  Well, sarcasm doesn't read in print.  But, you know, I'm happy he died reads terribly like, oh, yeah, I'm happy he died.  There's a tremendous, that was me acting, there's a tremendous difference, and people  know that, and we have that common bond of language.  But people, what I hate about people is they pretend they don't know it, because the bigger  goal is to get you to not say what they don't like.  Exactly.  And that's all it is.  And some people, you know, there's, again, there's, there's, in a Venn diagram, there'd  be lots and lots of overlaps.  But some people are genuinely angry, and they don't know why everyone doesn't find the 
[01:23:00]  same things wrong as they do.  Then they just want a retweet.  Then they just don't like you.  Then they just want to say something because no one listens to them.  Yeah.  Ever.  That's often, that's often the case.  An excuse to be heard.  Absolutely.  An excuse to be heard.  They're frustrated that they're not heard like we are, that they haven't got that platform.  So they want to bring us down a peg or two.  And if they say, if you say you're sorry, and if you've wounded somebody, when people  are wounded, we, what's wrong?  Talk.  We'll listen to you now.  Yeah.  People want to pretend that they're wounded by somebody's words. 
[01:23:30]  Well, yeah.  I had many complaints, you know.  I used to work in a public sector.  I used to work at a university, and they had a complaint.  And sometimes they just couldn't believe you'd called them back.  They go, oh, thanks.  Don't worry about it.  They wanted to talk to someone.  Yeah.  They wanted to be heard.  And, you know, that's all, that, they were happy.  They were happy.  They, you know, and, uh, um, I think that is the case sometimes.  But I did a, I did a show, Madison Square Garden, okay?  So a lot of people, I did jokes about, um, uh, race, the Holocaust, uh, um, uh, Anne Frank 
[01:24:00]  jokes.  Oh, no.  Um, paedophile jokes, everything.  I got a letter from, um, a society saying, oh, we loved your show.  We found it, uh, we were very disappointed at the joke about Anne Frank, right?  And I, uh, I said, but you understood the satire behind the famine joke, the paedophile  joke, the racist joke.  You understood that, because it wasn't your thing.  Right.  But you can't get over your thing. 
[01:24:30]  You think, well, why is, you know, I'm the same with some things.  I don't like certain jokes about certain things, because I, I can't get over them emotionally.  You know, I don't, uh, uh, but I've got to keep that quiet.  I've just got to, you know, you've got, you've got to take the rough with a smooth, you know?  And you can understand, on that intellectual level, that if their intent here, here, and  here was not malicious, here it probably wasn't malicious either.  Yeah.  You know?  Just because you don't like that being brought up, doesn't mean that this guy was trying  to hurt your feelings. 
[01:25:00]  No, exactly.  And that's what it feels like.  That's what a fence feels like.  A fence feels that, why is he having a go at me?  And you've got to step back from that, and go, well, he's not having a go at me.  He doesn't even know you.  Yeah.  Unless I name you.  Right.  You know, I think that's, that's, that, that, that's one thing I don't do, uh, too often.  I don't say, uh, uh, well, one, uh, I, you know, again, it depends what the target of  the joke is.  And sometimes, even if you name someone, they're not actually the target of the joke.  They're instrumental in getting to the target of the joke.  So, I can understand why someone, uh, would feel bullied if, God, he just got on stage and 
[01:25:30]  talked about, it's, it, you, you have to take the personal out of it, I think.  Like, you know, and I think better, the better the joke is, the more universal it is.  Or if they admitted what they're really doing.  Like, I would respect people if they said, you said something I don't like, and I really  don't want you to be able to say it.  But there's a, there's a self-centeredness in that honesty that they won't do.  So, what they have to do is create, even to themselves, a reason that seems legit. 
[01:26:00]  Well, here's why you shouldn't make fun of race.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  But here's why you shouldn't make fun of drunk drunk.  Everyone has a reason.  No one ever just comes out and says the truth, which is, I don't like it, and I don't want  you to say it.  There's an ugliness in that.  Well, I think there are reasons you shouldn't make fun of race, because no one can help  their race.  But you can make fun about race.  You can make jokes about race.  Right.  But you shouldn't make, you should, I don't think you should, this is what I'm saying  about the target and the, uh, the subject are different.  You know, the reason why you shouldn't have a go at, uh, anyone for anything, they can't 
[01:26:30]  help.  And the reason why real racist jokes aren't funny to me, and not because I'm offended by  them, because they're not true.  As soon as someone says, why do Mexicans da da da da, that fact is usually spurious.  It's not a true fact.  Says there's a, there's a, there's an injustice to it.  Okay.  Do you know, do you know what I mean?  I do.  What?  Um.  I don't, I don't know if I agree, but I do know what you mean.  Well, if someone said, um, why are Swedish people all pedophiles?  My first thought is, they're not. 
[01:27:00]  Oh.  I can't, now I can't laugh, whatever the punchline is.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah, and Jim wanted to move when he was there.  I'm going to fucking go for dual citizenship.  Yeah.  So, I think, I think, again, the joke fails.  If every part of it is totally untrue, uh, it's rallying.  And that would be, that, that to me would be people wanting, that you'd need them to  all agree with that.  Hey, all the Swedish people, for it to be funny or get around applause.  And, and so, it fails, it fails purely on a comedic level to me. 
[01:27:30]  Okay.  Not on a political one.  Right, right.  Do you know what I mean?  I do.  And you're also not saying that people, uh, should get, the important thing for me is  if somebody, there's certain jokes I don't like too.  Yeah.  But if, I've never called for anyone to be penalized for them.  Mm.  And so I never have a problem with people saying they don't like certain type of jokes.  No.  Or they don't think, uh, like I had a debate with a, a feminist, and who I actually wound  up liking on, uh, on an FX show.  We talked about rapes.  You said that like it was a surprise.  I went in there with all the prejudices you would have, and, uh, yeah. 
[01:28:00]  Well, I was surprised though, because her opinion and mine are vastly different.  And we didn't change each other's opinions, but we had a respectful discussion.  I think I saw it.  I think I saw it.  I think it was, yeah.  It was on, um, yeah, it was online.  Yeah, that was great.  And come out about it.  Yeah.  But, uh, you know, the thing was, she wasn't calling for people to be censored.  She had a very tricky argument.  Um, we just didn't see eye to eye.  And the frustrating, everyone comes to a crossroad in the debate, where we realize we're not  going to change each other's minds.  So do we say, okay, but that's when people get angry, when we don't get our way and can't  change their mind.  No, as I remember, and I don't want to misquote her, but as I remember, her worry was that, 
[01:28:30]  I think she had a term called, um, uh, rape culture, yeah, where, uh, the assumption  was, if it's all out in the open and it's okay to joke about, um, it desensitizes people  and can cause, uh, an environment where rape wasn't so heinous and terrible, and I don't  believe that.  I don't either.  I don't, I don't think anyone has ever gone, I saw a funny, uh, rape routine. 
[01:29:00]  I'm going to try it tonight.  Right.  I don't think that's ever happened.  I don't either.  And, and I think that's a big misconception, big, because, because we can joke about terrible  things that we're somehow condoning it is totally untrue, and I, I, I, I, I couldn't  find the actual bad things that I joke about more offensive and more disgusting and want  them to end more than anyone I ever know, but that doesn't stop me joking about them.  That's the challenge, to me, that's almost what the beauty of being a comic is.  It was like, I, I did jokes about the beheading in, uh, in Britain, and the point was... 
[01:29:30]  Okay, that's too much.  I, the point of the joke was, it had something to do with the way, uh, radical Islam treats  women, which was negative, and, uh, but people, they, like you said, they grew up, the minute  they hear...  Well, of course, because I need to hear the joke, yeah, you need to hear, you need to hear,  exactly, it depends, and you, as you said, you, you said joked about it, and, um, and that's  the important thing.  Uh, at no point, I, did, do I imagine you ever condoned that, that act of violence. 
[01:30:00]  No, and people know, and people read sarcasm, and people, you know, it's like a lot of  times, and there's been times where I've said things that were, I didn't sincerely mean,  but a lot of times the joke is in the ludicrousness of the opinion.  Of course.  Like, people know, and every reasonable person knows that you don't mean that, you just,  it's like if you say your dick is eight feet long, nobody actually says, no, it's not,  and means it literally, they're fucking morons.  Well, some people are morons, some people don't, don't understand it, and, and, and I do  that, and, um, as I say, you sort of play a slight character, and, uh, I think people 
[01:30:30]  get to know the thing you're playing.  I, I, I started with stand-up, and on TV, playing a character, I'd said all the wrong  things, but everyone knew that, you know, I came down politically on the wrong side.  I say things like, Nelson Mandela, um, what a great man.  It used to get a round of applause.  Just saying that, I got a round of applause, like, in the right audiences.  They just clapped, just clapped his name.  Right, and I went, um, incarcerated for 25 years, uh, he's been out now about 20 years,  and he hasn't re-offended.  I think he's going straight.  Which shows you prison does work. 
[01:31:00]  But they knew that was wrong.  They knew that was back to front week.  Yeah, yeah.  I get it.  He's misunderstanding, you know, so they, they understand some things.  But it's not their thing.  Right.  It's not their thing.  The whole thing, that's what's so weird about what's happened with the internet, is that,  because, like, you would think, you're putting out so much content on the internet now,  and you would think that that would be the ultimate sort of, this is where I put my stuff.  If you like my stuff, here's the link to it.  If you don't like it, you never have to click it, you never have to see it. 
[01:31:30]  It's not on your TV, it's not going to pop up at you, none of that's ever going to happen.  But, people even more so than anywhere else.  Of course.  Seek out what they don't like, so they can write a comment, so they can tweet you some nonsense.  Of course.  So they think that, they think everything's personal, yeah.  Yeah.  Basically, the Twitter, if you follow someone, you've got to imagine that you're standing  by a notice board in the middle of a big town, and someone comes up and puts up guitar lessons,  right?  Mm-hmm.  And then they're standing there and go, 
[01:32:00]  But I don't want to learn guitar!  Right?  Well, no, it's not actually a,  I don't want to learn guitar!  I want to learn banjo!  And so they forget that they're standing by the notice board in the middle of a big town.  Right.  Just keep, keep walking, you'll find banjo lessons somewhere.  Well, there might be banjo lessons somewhere, I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, why tell me that?  Well, I wasn't talking to you, really.  Honestly, I wasn't talking to you.  Um, so yeah, everyone takes everything personally.  And everyone thinks that what they care about is what everyone should care about. 
[01:32:30]  Right.  And that, that's, that, that's a given.  The worst is yet to come.  This is so fucked up, man.  This is ONA's worst of 2013 so far on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Yeah, this is Opie and Anthony's worst of 2013 so far.  It's the worst of 2013 so far with me, Sam Roberts, acting as your host while Opie and  Anthony have been on vacation all week long. 
[01:33:00]  And 2013 included an appearance by one of the more interesting guys we have on the Opie  and Anthony show.  That man's name is Anthony Bourdain.  Of course, his show is called Parts Unknown on CNN.  And he was in talking about doing his show, talking about great restaurants to go to,  cuisine, and of course, the ridiculous things that he's seen as he's traveled the world.  Uh, all his life experience, and still a fun guy. 
[01:33:30]  It's amazing.  Anthony Bourdain on the worst of 2013 so far.  This is ONA's worst of 2013 so far on the Opie and Anthony channel.  I've been seeing you on buses all week.  Yeah, I know.  It's kind of creepy.  It's nice, though.  Gee, it's weird.  It's weirding on my daughter, too.  You know, she's like, Daddy, or, you know.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  Everywhere she goes, there's your face, and it's just kind of odd.  It's bad, too much of that shit.  You start talking about yourself with a third person.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:34:00]  That's never a good thing.  The show getting a lot of heat.  The ATV footage was everywhere.  Yeah, that hurt.  What the?  Yeah, huh?  Bad luck on ATVs.  Yeah, yeah.  That's like, what, your second run-in?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, I don't know what I was thinking.  Yeah, I was watching, and I'm like, you're going really fast, first of all.  Right.  And going through water and everything, which to me seems, you know, that's that unknown factor.  I've been out in the sun for like four hours to get these shots, and I'm cooking. 
[01:34:30]  I mean, it's really hot.  The sun's coming down.  I'm dehydrated.  I'm drinking beer.  Where was this?  This was in a remote area of Colombia, along the Venezuelan border.  And, yeah, I took a tight turn and went over, and I mean, I just sort of drove my skull right into the ground.  I mean, my crew tells me I ran over my head.  I didn't, I wasn't awake for that.  But I remember I just felt so stupid that I was like, I've got to get up and appear like nothing happened. 
[01:35:00]  Right.  Because I really don't want to hear the I told you so's.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the first thing people normally do is like, all right, let me get up and make it seem like nothing happened.  Right.  I'll just, you know, ah, yeah, no, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.  And then meanwhile, you know, you're not fine.  God, I'm fine.  You know, pardon me.  Well, I pissed myself.  What was the injury?  What was the injury?  Was it a concussion?  I was out for a second, but, you know.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, you got thrown.  I hate that feeling.  That just, boom.  It's that fast, violent, you know, something's not right thing. 
[01:35:30]  Not having control, right?  Not quite, you haven't quite figured it out yet.  Like, what am I doing here?  Yeah.  What happened?  I just went straight in and it was like a pile.  I like straight, but head first straight into the ground.  Yeah.  If there were a comic book noise, it would have been something like a skronk.  Yeah.  Ozzy almost died doing that fucking, oh, man.  ATVs are rough, man.  The first ATV accident I had, who gets to use that?  So the first time I was on, I think, Jimmy Kimmel, and I showed that clip and Ozzy was the  other guest and he's sitting next to me. 
[01:36:00]  And after the show, he followed me around backstage for like 45 minutes, like his doddering  grandmother saying, Anthony, Anthony, don't do that again.  Anthony, you could have died.  So did Anthony come here?  He was grabbing my hand and running it along his collarbones.  I could feel all the metal plates in there.  Oh, right.  Feel his injury.  Oh, he's got plates?  Yeah.  He was personally, like, horrified by this thing.  And just, he was, he just took it upon himself to, you know, bring me back to the light. 
[01:36:30]  You know what the thing about ATVs are, too?  You get on, you start riding, and at first, you're kind of cautious, you're feeling it  out.  But in no time, you really think you have it down.  Yeah.  Like, because you start going a little faster, you know, you get your balls and you're like,  yeah, this is good.  And meanwhile, you haven't been riding the thing more than 20 minutes.  You've gone from, you know, very slow, just figuring it out, to now you're a pro, going  off jumps, going through water, taking tight turns, sliding.  Yeah. 
[01:37:00]  It's like, no, you're not good.  No.  This thing is overpowering you.  And then you got in the back of your head, you got to get some good footage for the TV  show.  Well, that, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was that.  Were you driving worse than you should have because you knew the camera was rolling?  Probably a little bit.  Compared to what?  I suck.  I mean, I shouldn't be on one.  Oh, man.  What other, any other catastrophes during the show?  During that one?  No.  You know, we have a Libya show coming up, which is the best thing I've ever, ever done.  I mean, it was awesome. 
[01:37:30]  And then I think since I saw you guys last, the Congo, which was the hardest show we've  ever done.  Yeah.  Huh?  What made the Congo hard?  There's probably an obvious answer there.  It's 29 different rebel groups.  Right.  And, you know, this shit goes wrong at every turn.  I mean, it's a country without really much infrastructure.  And the worst case scenario, like if things go wrong, like you're robbed or extorted or  something, or you get a flat tire and you find yourself in the middle of a robbery and extortion  is in the same category as a flat. 
[01:38:00]  The worst case scenario is that the cops or the army come to help you out.  Oh, really?  Then let the real, then it gets really bad.  Why is that bad?  They're pretty good at, you know, rape and murder are pretty much, you know, the specialty.  For the cops in the military?  It's bad.  Really bad.  So if they come to help you, you say that they're...  It's the worst thing that could possibly happen.  Jesus.  They're not going to help you.  They're professionals that will rob you.  Look, a rebel dude wants to take your stuff.  You could say, I mean, I guess you could say, fuck you, I'm not giving it to you, and you 
[01:38:30]  could run.  Or you could, you know, maybe punch somebody and make a break for it.  I mean, not that that would be a good idea.  But when the, an official, I mean, the army have, they've stolen the diplomatic bag from  like the ambassador.  I think the French ambassadors.  I forget which one.  But I mean, they just don't have any problem.  Right.  All of you.  You've given me that.  Okay.  And if you fight back, you're, you know.  Now it's an official problem.  Right.  You're going to put you in jail forever.  That's probably not a good jail either.  I bet a jail in the Congo.  I bet it's not, you can't really protest for better conditions. 
[01:39:00]  It is probably, it is, natural resource wise, it's the wealthiest country in Africa.  It's the size of all Western Europe.  It's beautiful.  It's a very, very, very, very complicated situation.  But it really was an adventure and I got to say a privilege to see you.  How do you stay safe?  It's, look, it's dangerous.  It's a place where the situation changes from minute to minute, where everything, you know, 
[01:39:30]  you just got to be really careful.  You don't carry arms.  You drive around in vans with TV written on the side and a big sign with an AK, like a  silhouette of an AK with a red circle.  Right.  That you don't have any weapons.  You do not have any weapons.  So nothing to see here, folks.  Nothing particularly good to steal.  You don't, you don't travel with armed security.  That just isn't going to.  Why is that?  Because it's 29 different official rebel groups.  Those are the ones with names. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, shit.  And then these guys called Mai Mai who are local defense forces.  You just make yourself a big fat target if you, if you're, if you're in any way armed.  I mean, you have security people, you have local fixers who sort of, you know, the idea  is to argue your way out of a situation, finesse your way out of a situation.  There's a lot of, uh, you did have a fixer or you didn't?  Yeah.  Oh, you have to have Congolese who are looking after you who know, okay, this guy needs 10  minutes of FaceTime, a lot of handshakes and maybe a fruit basket. 
[01:40:30]  Um, this is, this guy's a problem.  Time to get in the van and, you know, get out of here.  Like who is the problem?  Would it be like a local chief or?  Local security.  The, whoever the sinister local, you know, head of the internal security ministry is,  but a lot of ministries, I don't like a place with ministries.  What's weird though is even in the middle, we're up in, uh, what was essentially in the  book heart, the heart of darkness, you know, where Kurtz was, uh, and we're about a hundred 
[01:41:00]  clicks out of there, middle of the jungle, no power anywhere, nothing resembling running  water, five bars on a cell phone, from the middle of the jungle.  Holy shit.  That's pretty amazing.  You would love our friend Jonathan, right?  Oh yeah.  My manager goes to play.  He's never been in the Congo, but he goes to crazy, uh, takes crazy trips.  He's obsessed with travel and he's got the same kind of view you do.  Like he just wants to see these places and he doesn't go in armed. 
[01:41:30]  He doesn't, you know, he just, he took a tour of Africa recently and you know, just, he  said the driving was the worst part because you get motion sick because the roads are  so fucking twisted and the infrastructure is just non-existent.  Yeah.  You get to tenderize kidneys.  He didn't go where Anthony went though.  He didn't go like that.  It was, it was like an amazing, amazing experience.  And what'd you end up filming in the Congo?  Oh man, everything.  I mean, uh, Goma, you know, we start out at Goma in the Eastern Kivu, which is very contentious 
[01:42:00]  area and then sort of centered on Conrad, Apocalypse Now, the Heart of Darkness and the  kind of took a look at the history of the Congo through the Congo river.  And wow.  It's a lot of history to, to, to try and discuss in a visual way.  Cause most people look at the Congo and they just throw their hands up in the air and they  say, I, you know, it's too much.  I can't, uh, you know, how do you explain this in three minutes, much less 42 minutes?  Um, so, you know, we try to do that in, in, in a visual way. 
[01:42:30]  That's, but, um, is it, is it scary when you, as you said that you have a handler and like  the guys are talking to the local guy and you don't know if they're being, you know,  cause other kinds of the language barrier, you don't know if they're screaming at each  other.  Is this how these guys talk or are they, is there a problem?  You get used to that really quick, but there is a lot of screaming and threats.  Jesus.  It's, that's called negotiation.  Sounds crazy.  Sounds exhausting.  You know, him, arrest him, you know, that sort of thing. 
[01:43:00]  But your guy would say to you like, all right, we can't fix this.  How did you know that you weren't going to be stopped when the guy goes like, hey, this  guy's a problem?  Look, there were a lot of, a lot of moments where this situation is bad and these are our  options, you know, make a run for it.  or, you know, land or a river, you know.  But we had really, really great fixers  who were just really good at going through the process,  meaning there's a screaming, yelling, and threats process,  then there's a talk-em-down process, 
[01:43:30]  then there's, you know, we'll have some warm beer  and maybe some money will be exchanged.  But what were they mad about?  You came to, you talked to the mayor first.  You didn't come right to me first.  The mayor got a fruit basket,  and I'm putting him in jail.  You know, you should have come to me first.  Wow.  Putting you in jail?  Well, where's the mayor?  It's like management here.  And then I can guarantee your safety, you know,  which is not a good thing to hear. 
[01:44:00]  No.  Is that a threat almost?  Because it's not just not guaranteeing your safety.  We're going to make it very difficult.  Yeah, we're going to do it ourselves.  I guarantee your safety is definitely not what you want to hear where we were.  So there's no right answer.  Obviously.  You're always pissing off somebody.  Yeah.  Also, you were in a situation where any state employee probably hasn't been paid anything in six months.  There were guys showing up at the train station and kissing on you.  I don't think it's been fully operational, if operational at all, 
[01:44:30]  since like the early 60s and only partially operational since the 70s.  Oh, my God.  The whole staff shows up, and I mean, the whole train station's overrun.  The tracks are overrun.  They show up every day, and they do their job.  They try to keep the trains repaired with no money.  Guys who show up at this moldering library in the middle of the jungle, they show up hoping.  They just show up to work.  They put on their jacket, they tie, they go in. 
[01:45:00]  There's a library there?  We went to this Belgian research center in the middle of the jungle.  It was pretty awesome.  Wow.  It was really, really wild.  What's the library like?  Huge, like, futurist, kind of, you know, Futurama-style library complex that thousands of people used to work at,  out in the middle of the jungle, overgrown completely.  You see a lot of that.  I mean, you see the hotel where Bogart and Bacallst and Catherine Hepburn stayed during the African Queen. 
[01:45:30]  You know, it used to be a really beautiful, industrialized wonderland for white people.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, the Congolese weren't allowed to walk their own streets, but if you were a middle-class Belgian, you were living large in the Congo.  You had railways and modern buildings and infrastructure, sports club, you know, the pool, the health, you know, the golf courses, all of that. 
[01:46:00]  And, you know, when they split, the Belgians, they plugged the toilets with cement, scuttled everything in sight.  And since they hadn't allowed anyone to, you know, go beyond, I think, like, middle school, you know, they left, like, eight qualified guys in the whole Congo to run a country.  What year did the Belgians leave?  Early 60s.  Why were they such pieces of shit about it?  Man, they were not a...  Before the Belgians, the whole country was owned by King Leopold of Belgium. 
[01:46:30]  And he basically killed half the population, pushing them to collect rubber and ivory.  And if you didn't bring in your quota for rubber by hand-tapping it and extracting it, cut your arms off.  Jesus.  Their people were paid by the arm.  This was in the 20th century.  It's kind of like kicking over you at the sandcastle before you leave the beach.  Right.  Not uncommon.  A lot of guys in Africa, a lot of...  I mean, it wasn't just the Belgians.  Also, to be fair, the Congolese, as soon as they got independence, you know, made the mistake of democratically electing basically a communist. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Who we quickly had killed, okay, us and the British and the Belgians.  And so we were not too eager to see them succeed, particularly given the large uranium deposits in the country, which we did not want to fall into the hands of the Russians.  So, you know, it did not make us unhappy at that particular period of time that the country was not working. 
[01:47:30]  So without the colonialism there now and stuff, what is the issue now?  They're surrounded.  They're bristling with diamonds, gems, natural resources that everybody wants.  They've got neighbors like Rwanda with huge displaced armies who've been kicked out of Rwanda.  Rwanda now running around in the Congo because the last president, any president actually, they can't rely on their own army. 
[01:48:00]  Anytime they have problems within the country, they make a lot...  They basically rent out or sell off their national resources to neighbors, neighboring countries who send in armies to ally with the current president and then hang around and make sure that they get to keep stuff.  So there are all of these surrogate armies controlled by the neighbors, as well as all these Looney Tunes little breakaway groups who one minute, you know, ten minutes ago were working with the army and the national government and are now allied against them. 
[01:48:30]  Have you ever thought, like, what's the solution here?  What would be the solution to get a viable, world-accepted country there?  It's so big, that's the problem.  I mean, it's like the size of all Western Europe.  Yeah.  Capital, most of it's jungle, so it's really, really hard.  Look, they need a large functioning management class for sure.  Mm-hmm.  But, you know, we can hardly pull that off in this country. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  You said something back there that everything's being overgrown.  Yeah.  That must have been really cool to see.  It's hauntingly beautiful.  Right.  To see, you know.  And the Bogart Hotel where they stayed?  Yeah.  That's one of the places that's completely overgrown?  Yeah, it's a squat now, but it was called the Poor Quapah Hotel.  Did you get to go inside it?  I'm reading Heppern's memoir as I'm, you know, looking at it.  Yeah, did you go inside of it?  Yeah.  And it's just being overgrown?  Well, I mean, there's squatters living in it. 
[01:49:30]  Wow.  Jeez.  And that library is not used for anything anymore, right?  Well, no, there are a few, you know, there are still a few Congolese students who were  trying to make use of that research.  It's heartbreaking.  You know, people are trying, but it's really, really tough.  That's a situation where you fight to live every day.  Yeah.  Has that given you a, like, how has it changed your perspective of the United States at  all, when you see stuff like that, and it's stuff that, I mean, only a small percentage 
[01:50:00]  of people in America would even see that.  How has it changed your...  Well, you know, if I hear somebody whining about writer's block, you know, I'm not too  sympathetic.  Right, right.  When you see how hard people will work just to stay clean, you know, how hard they'll work  to just to, you know, maintain their pride, clean clothes, clean body, you know.  Yeah.  That's, it's not what you expect. 
[01:50:30]  Does it give you more patience here?  Are you more patient with things, or...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got to.  You, you, you, you're thinking that there, you know, when the ferry goes out and it's  another seven hour away to get across the river, and that's every day.  Right, right.  You know, you think, you know, I'm never going to yell at a traffic light again.  Yeah.  The one minute that it's taking.  God damn it, I missed the light.  Yeah.  So we've been mixing, you know, I mean, look how easy I got it.  I mean, they're, okay, we're bitching about, okay, oh God, if I just, just one, one, one 
[01:51:00]  toilet, you know, one, one good shower.  Right, right.  You know, but that's for what, a week, 10 days?  Yeah, yeah.  The next show I'll be in Spain, you know, eating tapas and, you know, drinking red wine.  Have you taken a lot of shits outdoors?  Yeah, we're professionals, man.  We got it all figured out.  You're real good at, you know, all of these things you never thought you'd have to learn.  We're getting real good at, yeah.  Yeah, the alfresco dump yesterday. 
[01:51:30]  Do you ever think, like, I'm going to this place and I've overstepped this time.  We made a mistake thinking we were going to be safe and we are, I know you have a lot  of scary moments, but has there been any times where you're like, I really fucked up this  time?  Me, no.  There were some days in Libya, there were some times, because there was stuff going  on around us.  I mean, it wasn't like, oh my God, we're going to die. 
[01:52:00]  But this situation was getting worse every day and there was a lot of discussion whether  to stay or go.  Like every day there was an emergency meeting.  Okay, this is the latest security briefing and our security guys were not, you know,  when you're security guys are saying, look, if we'd known before what we know now, we  wouldn't have come.  We wouldn't have advised you not to come.  That's great, man.  And so every day it was sort of like the whole crew had a vote, or are we bugging out for  the airport, or are we going to try to hang on for another few days?  How would you vote? 
[01:52:30]  I voted to stay.  I mean, I felt pretty, I'm not a guy by a long shot, but I didn't see any immediate, it  looked okay to me.  The people around us were cool.  The Libyans were very cool with us.  There was stuff happening outside of our view that was worrying.  We talked to, we have the Vice guys in sometimes, and I love their documentaries, and Shane  was saying that the worst place, of all the places, the scariest was Juarez, Mexico. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  Would you go there?  Would you go to certain places in Mexico at this point, or do you think you might want  to avoid that?  I don't know.  It depends on what the situation is.  I'm not looking to put, unlike them, I'm not looking to put my head up into a firing  line just for good TV.  I'm there for another reason.  And I'm willing to accept a certain amount of risk if there's a really good story or  something interesting there.  But I'm not looking at, you know, hey, look at me.  I'm in Juarez. 
[01:53:30]  Right, right, right.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  I mean, I love Mexico.  So, I mean, I'd love, if you tell me, if enough people tell me it'll be okay, we've  been to a lot of places where they say you shouldn't go that turn out to be really cool.  But when you're in these places, like, do you come back here and see news from the Congo  and from Libya, and does it affect you more in that way?  Well, I think...  Do you have to carry this around with you now, going, you know, not only feeling bad for  your own country and what's happening here, but now you've got to have empathy for, like, 
[01:54:00]  half the fucking globe?  I don't know.  You know, it's weird.  You steal your heart to a lot of things.  That's what I assume.  Yeah, yeah.  Really, you have to.  I mean, I've seen this happen with NGOs and people who work in environments like that.  Right.  Just in order to get to work every day without having a breakdown.  Yeah, yeah.  Constantly weeping.  You inure yourself to certain things.  I get angry seeing really stupid coverage of places like Libya.  You know, no clue. 
[01:54:30]  You know, there are actually idiots out there saying, you know, we were better off with  Gaddafi.  Oh, really?  You know, really?  It is a...  People say this with authority, having never been to Libya, never having met these kids,  the majority of people who overthrew, they get their news sources, the most, you know,  cretinous, you know, fringe, you know, under-informed conspiracy theory website.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're pretty, you know, Gaddafi, and this is from both left and right, you know, 
[01:55:00]  oh, Gaddafi was better.  No, no, he wasn't.  And the majority of the people who threw him out were people that you would like hanging  out with, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  They were cool.  There were kids who were, you know, playing, like, PlayStation, you know, a week before  they went to war.  Yeah.  Went home, you know, from Western universities to fight against the guy.  I mean, you know, they fought Soviet tanks with handmade weapons built out of, like, plastic 
[01:55:30]  and hair dryers and shit.  Right, man.  So, yeah, I got a lot of, you know, when I see really stupid, uninformed news coverage,  it makes me a little cranky.  And much like soldiers and police officers and whatnot, and you don't have to be specific,  but was there some form of gallows humor a little between you guys to just see some  horrible things, and in order to even deal with it, have to, you know, make a little  joking?  Yes.  You reach this stupid zone where, yes, you know, at a racist point, it's like, uh... 
[01:56:00]  To cope.  Coping mechanisms.  Well, you just start, like, getting getally-obsessed with getting anally-raped, you know.  It's like everything, you know.  Look who laughs first.  Jimmy.  Yes.  Yes.  I've never actually laughed thinking of it, but I always come.  It is, it is, uh, you know, it's a constant remain, especially when you're sort of, you 
[01:56:30]  know, when you're really tired.  Yeah.  You've been running, going, going, going.  You're stressed.  You're scared.  You're reading, you know, you're reading news reports of just, like, unbelievably awful  shit.  Yes.  You make stupid, uh, and wildly inappropriate humor.  Right, right.  No doubt about it.  What do you, what do you, where do you go on personal vacations?  Like, where do you like going around, around the world?  Look, any beach where I can just stay put, uh, is good for me.  Nice beverage on the beach. 
[01:57:00]  I'm out on the island this summer.  Yeah, yeah.  I just hang out with the family, and then I'm not doing anything, you know.  I'm walking to the barbecue in the bed back.  That's about it.  That's, uh, because, yeah, your work puts you in a position, when you're vacationing,  you're not the, uh, hey, excursion guy.  Right.  You're not fucking, let's, let's do this, and steamers, beer.  That's it.  Nice.  But the people he goes with, they're all hoping he comes up with a plan for that  day.  Yeah, we're laying here on the lounge chair with a drink in my hand.  Right, he's going to come up with the excursion.  Hell no.  I'm going with my family, and it's like, uh, I'm not, I mean, I'm not social at all. 
[01:57:30]  I'm not about, I don't, summer, I'm not about, uh, going to benefits or, uh, any of that  shit.  I'm, I don't, I don't, I don't know.  You just want to relax and kind of stay put.  Yeah.  If it's, uh, if there's a meal that I can't eat with my hands, it's a disaster.  It's a personal disaster.  If I have to put on, you know, anything other than a bathing suit, then it's, something's  gone seriously wrong with my vacation.  Well, how, how old were you when you first started like traveling on your own?  44.  Really?  So you were just pretty much a homebody kind of a guy? 
[01:58:00]  No, I was working in restaurants 14 hours a day.  Well, yeah.  But I mean, I hadn't been, I'd been to France for a couple of summers, a few weeks out of  a few summers.  Uh, I'd been in the Caribbean a few times, but that was about it.  Yeah.  Wow.  So yeah, big, big, uh, big change for me.  So it was, you know, work that took you, uh, around the globe.  Well, I mean, I made sure I, I worked to make sure that that was my work and I said, look,  uh, you know, the book's doing really well. 
[01:58:30]  Um, I got to cash in on this.  I got to, you know, I, I, I made a success by writing about my life and I only got one of  those.  So you got to make some more of it, you know, got to get somebody to send me out there to  have adventures and do all the shit I always wanted to do and then hopefully I'll have  something to write about.  And that ended up being, uh, you know, 13 years later, um, I'm still doing it.  You like colder climates or warmer climates better?  I'm a warm, I don't like, I hate clean, orderly countries, you know, Switzerland would 
[01:59:00]  be a living hell to me.  I hate Alpine vistas, clean streets, functioning, crime-free societies.  I like hot, messy, dysfunctional, passionate societies where people yell at each other  and serve delicious, spicy food.  That's just the opposite of what I like.  That's more exciting.  Yeah.  You'd rather be in like Sweden than, than like Southern Italy?  Oh yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Well, in Southern Italy, I would, I would mind Italy.  Italy's, I'm thinking of, of, of disorganized places. 
[01:59:30]  I mean, I, I like a nice, I like a nice clean street.  He likes a clean street.  He likes a hotel that has 24 hour room service.  Yeah.  Gentleman's accommodations is what I say.  Yeah.  I mean, look, I like a good, I like some good plumbing, but, but, uh, you know, clean streets,  I, I, I can hear the jackboots coming, you know what I mean?  It's a, wherever, you know what I mean?  Is there a place you haven't been yet that you want to be?  Iran.  I'd love to go to Iran.  Iran.  The government is, uh, you know, we'll, we'll see how that goes.  You probably get, you know what I mean?  Oh, you can go in.  I just, uh, if they loosen up a little bit right now, it's a kind of, it's a hostile environment. 
[02:00:00]  But the people are supposed to be awesome.  The country is supposed to be great.  It's supposed to be easy to get around there.  The people are lovely.  The food's amazing.  It's a beautiful place.  It's just a really fucked up, uh, uh, government.  I've, I've heard the youth of Iran loves America.  They're young.  It's a very young country.  I think the majority, the vast majority of the population are under 28.  Yeah, and they really like what we do here in America.  But for some reason, they can't figure that out. 
[02:00:30]  Get some of that going over there.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, it's, uh, it's a tough situation.  What about North Korea?  Would you like to go there?  I think it would be poor taste to go do a, you know, I mean, I'm known for food shows.  There's not a lot of food there.  Uh, they're not going to let me see much.  Good point.  Interesting.  You know, you get these handlers of situations like that who are, you know, look at glorious  buildings of revolution.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It is worse.  This is hilariously bad. 
[02:01:00]  More of O.P.  Anthony's worst of 2013.  So far.  So far.  Coming up.  Must hear moments for the past six months.  O.P.  Anthony's worst of 2013.  So far.  Continues.  That's why I don't even watch, I don't watch the news.  It's so, it's, it's, it's like gun laws.  I, if you, everyone should have a right to have a gun.  I think.  A gun.  Bang, bang, bang, bang. 
[02:01:30]  That's a gun.  Yeah.  That's a suspect.  Exactly.  That's what I say.  That's a suspect.  Unless you're in the military or you're, or you're hunting.  There's no reason for that.  No one could have a machine gun.  You can't have a machine gun.  You really can't.  And at the end of the day, this is, the news, they'll say, I, I would sit, some of my friends  are so Fox News oriented, it drives me, oh, this is how the Nazis did.  I go, what are you talking about? 
[02:02:00]  Who's up, the Nazis?  I'm like, no.  The last I heard, the Nazis would knock at the door, I'm like, does your name end in Stein?  They're not looking, like, what are you talking about?  Or, or they'll say, I get so riled, I, I, I feel bad for people when they go, well, it's  the Constitution, all right?  Like, are you retarded?  Yep.  Are you, they wore fucking wigs and tights when they wrote up the Constitution. 
[02:02:30]  It took 40 minutes on a guy on a fucking horse to shoot somebody.  There were no cars.  You had to get on a horse, you had to put fucking gunpowder and stick it in there, chase this  fucker, fixing your wig, because the bouncing of the horse was fucking your wig up.  Then you had to fix your tights, and then the gun would go up by accident, and it took  another 20 minutes to fucking get this guy to reload.  So that whole not, and, and then there's, and they go, well, what are the, you know, our 
[02:03:00]  government's taken over.  That, that argument makes me absolutely, like.  It is an asshole argument.  It's beyond an asshole argument.  Like, did you watch Boston?  Boston, did you see what happened when the so-called bomber, which is another fucking  thing, the bomber, dude, all right, I'm going to get started here.  I love it. 
[02:03:30]  For, for, for 24 straight, 24 straight hours, uh, they, they go, I hear me, there comes  the SWAT truck, and there's 14 SWAT people, and they show the same video of the fucking  SWAT truck, and here are the dogs.  And they, and then they would have the helicopters, and I sat there watching, going, oh man, they've  got those heat-seeking helicopters.  It's over.  And then, like, okay, we're running over here.  And then they, they.  Running over here.  And then they're going, I don't know what's going on over there, but they're all going 
[02:04:00]  over there.  That's how the newsguards were.  There's the helicopter, it's circling up.  It's been 24 hours, the guy, he was shot in a juggler.  How do you get shot in a fucking neck?  The dogs can't sniff you out.  Nobody can find blood.  My kid comes out of the pool with a stubbed toe, and I can see where this little fucking  yo-yo went all the way into the bedroom, not, not cleaning off their toe.  Like, I can see, you came out of the pool, you fucking stubbed your toe here, you walked 
[02:04:30]  all the way to the new carpet, into your fucking bedroom, and in the bed, I can see your stupid  stubbed toe.  This guy's hitting a juggler.  And the dog, there's going more swat teams and more dogs.  And they're, and they're, fucking, no one's allowed to have, she, like, old people coming  out of the house, and they're like, let go!  My dog has to shoot.  Get down!  Get back in the house!  You can be a suspect! 
[02:05:00]  My dog, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!  They got an old lady, and she's down on the floor, and they got the M-16s to her face!  Yeah.  And then, okay.  And then they show the same video.  Here's them walking around the corner again.  And obviously, the younger guy is following the older brother.  He's obviously the leader.  Let's look at that video one more time for the 1,700,000th time. 
[02:05:30]  Here's the older brother, there's the younger brother.  Here's the older brother, here's the younger brother.  This is moments before the bomb.  No one has these fucking guys dropping a bomb, walking a bomb, walking away.  But they got 18 million videos of walking around a corner.  No other fucking video.  Then, they let it all go.  Okay, we're releasing it, we can't find him.  He's in the boat, in the backyard.  Does anyone watch fucking Cops?  Like, he wasn't even, it was straight as, right in the backyard. 
[02:06:00]  Every Cops video is like, ah, he's under the fucking pool.  He's under the raft.  He's under a bush.  Alright, I'm not going to get into that.  What I'm getting into is, the whole, that's very suspect.  When people, when I watch that, that made me again look at yo-yos that are into like,  you can't take my guns away, because if the government takes over. 
[02:06:30]  So, the government's going to take over, and you're going to hold him off?  Did you see what happened in Boston, you fucking retort?  Yeah.  Mr. Educated, watch Fox News 24-7 with your degree.  Oh, you know what's going on in this country?  Really?  Oh, okay, your M-16's going to hold off that fucking army.  Army.  And that was just one town.  At the end of the day, if you're that packed, it's going to be some kid who's 18 going like 
[02:07:00]  this on a computer.  Okay, mission accomplished, sir.  And you're going to be sitting there with your whole arsenal going, do you hear, bottle  rocket?  What the hell sounds like a bottle?  Making accomplished.  And then the other stupid thing is, what were they, I was just listening to this three  days ago at someone's house, and I just, I'm silent, because I just watch these idiots 
[02:07:30]  argue with each other.  And they don't even, it's not even common sense, it's just watching news.  If you watch Fox News, you see NBC, they teach you how to argue each other.  They teach you how to argue each other.  There's no common sense.  On the one hand, you got this opinion, and on the other hand, you have this opinion, and  in this opinion, so you're already going, yeah, I feel it, yeah, that's how I feel.  You fucking morons.  That's how I feel.  That's exactly, all right, answer that question, Mr. Specialist. 
[02:08:00]  And so then, as the other one gets me nuts, well, China is going to take over, and this  is, what if we're taking over, if America's taken over, can you imagine, God forbid, we're  taken over.  Taken over.  We're invaded.  Oh, wow, okay.  We're invaded.  Mm-hmm.  They got past our amazing, intelligent military that found the fucking Boston bomber 24 hours 
[02:08:30]  by a neighbor.  Wasn't even for the military to find him.  The fucking neighbor said, I think there's some blood gushing out the boat.  Oh, I should say, he was even saying, there's some blood, out on the back, out on the backyard.  Whatever the fucking Boston people talk.  I think you might want to look into that.  If, if, if, if.  Some red liquid's coming out of my Boston whaler.  My whaler. 
[02:09:00]  Someone's fucking with my whaler in the yard.  My dog's licking the outside of my whaler.  He's got blood all over.  I ain't seen no dead rabbits.  And so, if you're sitting there, our intelligence, our amazing military that was all over that  couldn't stop that.  Couldn't catch them.  Yeah.  They can't stop whoever's going to infiltrate us.  Then our local police force takes over.  They can't stop them. 
[02:09:30]  Do you think Jed in Tennessee and Bob in Jersey with your, thank God for the gun law.  I got my, Tony on Long Island.  Yeah.  Tony on Long Island.  Gonna stop me.  Fumduck.  Fumduck.  Vladimir and whoever.  Who's just already crushed everyone.  This ain't Red Dawn in the night.  They say, Patrick Swayze ain't gonna help you, you retards.  People are retarded when they watch the fucking news. 
[02:10:00]  So, anyway.  I don't know how I got into that.  They're, uh...  Bravo.  Very funny, man.  Well, I do have a couple of responses.  Please.  Please.  I do have a couple of responses.  Please.  And, of course, I don't think there's anyone in their right mind that would assume that  a bunch of people with whatever weapons are legally available to the American public these  days can fend off the United States military. 
[02:10:30]  Correct.  I never thought that.  I don't think that's actually the point.  Correct.  What I think the point is, is that an armed public cannot be taken over with a swipe of  the pen, in more of a figurative term, but here it is.  You're not looking to defeat the United States Army with your guns at home.  Sure.  But...  Yes.  If the United States military, and the government leading that military, knows it has to fire 
[02:11:00]  upon its people, because its people will shoot back at them, it negates the country.  The country's gone at that point.  So then, what is the government actually holding onto at that point?  You know what I mean?  You can't open fire on a huge number of American people because they're shooting back at you.  Now, if the American people have no weapons, it's very easy to just legislate your will  upon them, and take away people's rights and whatnot. 
[02:11:30]  It's not winning.  The thing is, if you even get into a battle with the American people, you lose.  You instantly lose.  You've lost the country.  You've lost everything the country supposedly stands for.  Uh-huh.  And there's no more free United States of America.  I don't know.  And there is one now?  I know you can talk about what it is now and everything.  I understand that.  I don't think it's free now, either.  Waco?  And I think they can legislate against you. 
[02:12:00]  In small pockets of resistance like Waco and whatnot.  Boston?  Yes.  You can smooth it over and say, well, these are individual things on a large scale, on  a large scale where a tyrannical American government wants to completely take over in some way.  I don't know what it would be.  But you cannot make that huge leap to, you know, mission accomplished.  You can't do that and then have people show up at Disney World the next day like nothing happened. 
[02:12:30]  You know what I mean?  It takes a...  Shut up, Jimmy!  That's a goofy argument.  It is not a goofy argument.  It is not a goofy argument.  It's a goofy argument.  It is not a goofy argument.  At the end of the day, what are you saying?  I still don't even understand what you're saying.  What I'm saying is an armed population of this country, everyone that's armed in this  country, is legally.  Okay, you got arms, I got arms.  Okay, I got that.  Now what? 
[02:13:00]  I believe it is a deterrent to the government just invoking its will on the people without...  No, no, no.  Anthony, you really think, let's say you've got a tank.  Let's say you've got...  Armored vehicle personnels or whatever.  Yes, you have a nuclear warhead in your fucking garage.  Sure.  You really think at the end of the day, someone in Washington is going, listen, it's time for 
[02:13:30]  takeover, but keep away from that Anthony from the O&A show because he's got too many  weapons.  No, it never gets to that point.  So what is your...  I understand what you just said.  It's a deterrent.  It's almost an uneven detente.  Like someone's got a dog and I don't want to go in that house because they've got a  dog?  It's an uneven detente where it's a balance of power based on the fact that if anything  happens, it negates what we are right now.  It eliminates this country of ours. 
[02:14:00]  If the United States military starts firing on American people who are firing back at the  military on a level much bigger than Waco, then...  But that doesn't have to happen because...  You don't understand what I'm saying?  I don't know.  It's really pretty far-fetched.  It is not far-fetched.  You're talking about fucking communism.  You're talking about like pure Russian military.  Oh my God!  Hey, look!  It's the 4th of July parade. 
[02:14:30]  No, it's not!  Welcome to America!  Oh my God!  They're shooting on us!  I thought it was a float!  What happened to America?  They took our guns away.  That's what happened?  It's goddamn Nazism all over.  Like, you're so far-fetched in what you're saying.  No, it's not far-fetched.  Yes, it is.  It's crazy.  It's lunacy what you're saying.  I'm not even saying what's lunacy. 
[02:15:00]  It's lunacy!  You're saying more lunacy shit,  thinking the government is going to have some 18-year-old  in a fucking shipping container  launching drone attacks on cities that people have fucking...  That's lunacy!  That's more action movie shit than me saying  that people, the knowledge that the American people  have over 300 million guns in their possession.  You ever see the videos of like Iraq War  when they're on the ships?  Yes!  What do you think?  That's a guy packing a fucking missile in a thing?  That's a guy on a computer going... 
[02:15:30]  I know that!  I think you're missing my point!  I think a lot of people are.  No, I think a lot of people know exactly what I'm talking about.  I don't know what you're talking about.  It's simple.  There is a deterrent alone in the knowledge  that the American people are armed.  Regardless if they're armed with fucking muskets  or blowguns or anything else,  there's a deterrent there to know...  But no one cares if you've got a gun.  Like, I don't care if you've got a gun.  We're talking about crazy, semi-automatic... 
[02:16:00]  What's the difference between semi-automatic...  Assault rifles.  Assault rifles.  Shut up with assault rifles.  An assault rifle is a semi-automatic gun like a hunting rifle.  There's nothing different.  Right.  I'm talking like...  You can't hold one.  You can't hold a machine gun in this country.  You shouldn't!  There's no reason to!  But there is already a law!  There's no reason to...  I know, but again...  Why can't I have...  Why can't I go out right now in New York State  and buy a semi-automatic AR-15 
[02:16:30]  and take it to the range?  Because if you get fucking wasted  or someone finds it,  it's just...  It's a deadly fucking weapon.  Here's the other one.  Here's the other one.  Well, then you gotta stop cars  and we should take cars away!  What a fucking retard argument!  Right.  It's all madness, dude.  It's the thought process  that you really think it's gonna deter anything 
[02:17:00]  that I think starts insulting intelligence.  Well, then I think the bigger insult  is the thought process  thinking taking guns away from people.  Oh, yeah?  Try to buy that.  Try to buy that.  Why would I want to?  Gun is cool!  No, it's not!  Yes, it is!  One of my kids find it  or one of the retard kids across the street find it.  What are you, leaving it laying around like a rake?  Yeah, I'm so jealous, man.  You gotta be what's called responsible  when you're on a gun.  But people aren't!  Just like you want a car! 
[02:17:30]  With a car!  You gotta be responsible with a car!  You do!  But people aren't.  That's the problem.  But you have to be with a car!  But you're not.  You're letting people drive.  You're letting irresponsible people  get into cars to drive  and kill many more people than guns.  Now, you laugh at that.  You laugh at it,  but it's the same argument you're making!  Okay.  Oh, they leave their keys around  for their 16-year-old to jump in  and drive away!  Why do you leave your keys in your purse, dummies?  Because no one takes a car  and purposely drives into a school 
[02:18:00]  and mows them the fuck down.  And you know what?  On a statistical level,  it's very rare.  Statistics.  Alright, so when your kid is killed,  you let me know how that statistic works.  Hey, alright, how about the fucking...  That's the dumbest thing ever.  How about the six kids in Chicago  that were fucking shot over the weekend  that no one even gave a shit about?  Because we're that used to it now.  Like, oh, more kids killed.  Is that it?  What are you arguing for?  What are you...  What?  What are you, like, barking for?  What do you want?  You just want machine guns?  I want the ability...  Okay.  ...to live my fucking life 
[02:18:30]  the way I want it.  You have it!  No, I don't.  You got 50...  You got a big fucking contract.  I want to buy another one of those.  You got a great...  I want to buy another one of those.  Then move to a country  where you can get one.  Well, I guess I can't.  Why not?  Because they figured out,  the rest of the world figured out,  that when the fucking people...  Oh my god!  Stop it!  The rest of the world figured out what?  That when you have...  Savages are killing people  all over the world  with weapons a lot less  fucking sophisticated than that.  And you know what?  The people that kill us here 
[02:19:00]  are nice, young, educated people.  They're not savages.  Oh, they're not?  They're wackos.  Or they're on drugs.  Most of it is...  Or they had problems.  Or they grew up in a bad home.  They're not savages.  No, most of them are gang savages  and that's where all the homicides come from.  There's a small portion  that are those crazy white kids  that shoot up to schools  and that's what the news picks up on.  But it's not romantic and fun enough  when it's just gang bangers  shooting grandma for a piece of crack  or shooting at his body  from three feet away  and hitting three 12-year-olds. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Take it away.  They shouldn't have it.  Fucking take it away.  They shouldn't have it.  Take it away.  They shouldn't have it.  Right.  Yeah.  So what's the problem?  The problem is...  Like fireworks!  I'm annoyed  that I can't light off M80s anymore.  That bothers me!  But because some retard  blew his fucking hand off  or let his kid get wasted...  He got wasted  and the kid blew it up.  That fucked up 4th of July.  I think we still enjoy  4th of July every year. 
[02:20:00]  Now I gotta travel  to a fucking river  to watch it for 20 hours  and then take me 9 hours  to get home.  But we still have 4th of July.  It's no fucking difference.  No difference.  Too many retards  fucked it up.  The guy across the street...  A guy in my general neighborhood...  Yeah.  His kids came walking  around the neighborhood  with bullets strapped around  and with one of his guns.  It's like...  He should have been arrested. 
[02:20:30]  He should have been.  But he wasn't.  He should have been  fucking arrested.  He should have been.  Which proves to the point  we just...  We can't take control of it.  So when we can't  take control of it,  you're not allowed  to play with the choice.  You're fucked.  You think that  everyone should be based  on the lowest common denominator  and what they can  or can't fucking handle?  And that's how  we should take it away?  Well, you know what?  Maybe sometimes  you get up on stage...  Maybe you'll say shit  that offends people  or makes people do things  or influences people. 
[02:21:00]  So why don't we just  take what you say  and throw that out  the fucking window too, bro?  What's it got to do  with taking a gun  and shit somewhere?  That makes no sense.  You're saying  that because some people  can't handle certain things  that everyone can have it.  Murder weapons.  I don't have a murder weapon.  I don't have a weapon  that can destroy  and kill somebody.  Oh, we could argue  that you're fucking  influenced.  You're very influential.  Your speech is very influential.  Okay.  And look out.  You might influence people  to hurt homosexuals  or Negroes.  At the end of the day, 
[02:21:30]  are you upset  just with guns in general  or that you can't get  a machine gun?  No, no.  I don't need a machine gun.  You want to what?  I like a good semi-automatic.  You know,  when you pull the trigger,  every one pull,  one bullet flies out  the other end.  And you use it for target  and leisure.  I love going to the range  and targeting.  And then I like having  other weapons  that I use for self-protection.  Yes.  Which is,  I kind of like the idea  that it puts you  on equal footing  with some thug  that might want to do  you bodily harm. 
[02:22:00]  I'm with you there  a hundred percent.  Someone busts in your door.  I'm with you.  I'm sure if someone  kicks in your door,  the first thing you're going  to think is,  I wish I had a gun.  Hey, I'm not going to lie to you.  So someone came over  to my house.  He showed me his gun.  He's like,  listen,  I travel everywhere with a gun.  I need to let you know  I have a gun in your house.  Oh, that's nice.  I said, okay.  Let me see.  He goes, listen,  it's in a case,  blah, blah, blah.  And he showed it to me.  And I'm not going to lie.  My wife,  every night,  gives me a fucking  false alarm 
[02:22:30]  someone's breaking in.  And sometimes I get worried  because I know the golf club  or the bat  just ain't going to do it  with a bullet  facing my torso.  That's true.  So this one night  while they were sleeping over,  I swear to God.  Slept like a baby.  No,  I got woken up  in the middle of the night.  Someone's hustling  the front door.  What? 
[02:23:00]  I know I hear someone  trying to get in the front door.  This is every other month.  It was the first time  in my life  I just got up  with no fear.  Walked to the front door  and even asked who it was.  I just opened the front door  knowing  they may get me,  but my kids are safe  because right next to them  is some weapons  that are going to put  major holes in these people  or deter them.  I don't have a problem 
[02:23:30]  with that.  It's sort of like  playing a game  with rules.  We all have rules  to this game.  However,  as much as  steroids,  baseball,  whatever,  obviously  whoever's making  the rules up  aren't sticking to them  and it's  turning into  bad shit.  Yeah.  Here and there,  even if the percentage  is small,  even if it's blah, blah, blah.  And it's fucking things up  for you  who should have 
[02:24:00]  the right to go.  It certainly is.  I go to a range  and it's like this guy  he goes to a range.  When I went to the range  this guy had a  he had  it looked like  a Smith & Wesson  but it was  it sounded like  a cannon  and he warned us  he went,  hey listen.  He was a huge guy  he went,  hey listen.  I'm shooting off  I don't even  assault rifle.  He said it's assault  but it was a pistol.  Wow.  And this thing  literally  it was so loud 
[02:24:30]  even with the  with the headphones  on it  it was like  wow.  It was probably  the .50 caliber  yeah.  Yeah and it went  and flames  came out  the end  and the  what do you call it  the target  would just  explode  like feathers  getting  a pigeon  getting blown up  and you can see  his boner  and I would have  one too  just go  and my daughter  I had to say  she was shooting  and she was a beast  and she turned 
[02:25:00]  to me  and she went  I really like  that feeling  of power  it's just  fun to shoot  I get it  but does the average  citizen need that  I mean  oh Jimmy  I'm just  then  correct  Jimmy's an asshole  right  so  but who was at the  front door  who's at the  front  who was at the  front door  her imagination  I figured as much  but I needed to know  her imagination  who was at the 
[02:25:30]  front door  you left us with  and I opened the door  I like your analogy  though with sports  and there has to be  rules and things like that  I understand the  rules factor  but here's what  happens  imagine playing a game  where you're adhering  to the rules  but there's people  on the other team  that aren't paying  attention to any rules  and they're not  penalizing those people  every time someone  doesn't pay attention  to the rules  they go to the people  that are paying attention  and give them  more rules  like a household  it's crazy  if I'm in my house  and my kids  I go

[02:28:00]  so far  coming up  six months worth of shows  more than 500 hours  of audio  trimmed down to just  one week of essential listening  that's 20 hours of  mind-blowing radio  translation  we wasted well over  450 hours of your time  already this year  this is Opie and Anthony's  worst of 2013  so far  we're not even  halfway through the summer 
[02:28:30]  and we're already  celebrating everything  that has been  2013  with the worst of 2013  so far  the Opie and Anthony show  hosted by me  Sam Roberts  Opie and Anthony  will be back next week  for live shows  but until then  you've got this  Jim Norton  has had an interesting  2013  we start  we start with a little bit  of bizarreness  that was some  programming ideas  that Jim had  for reality shows  this is why he hasn't been  on television 
[02:29:00]  all that much  and then  a song  that whether you like it or not  will not leave your head  anytime today  listen now  on the worst of 2013  so far  Opie and Anthony's  worst of 2013  so far  I'm pitching a prank show  oh  yeah  where we do like  little wacky pranks  like  any ideas  yeah  there's one  I want to do  where  it's  it's in the  hospital 
[02:29:30]  in the maternity ward  and  what we do is  we like  we have like  a fake fire  where all the little  bassinets are  yeah  and we come out  and tell all the parents  we're sorry  but the fire's  burned all of your babies  holy shit  and then  who are you pitching this to  NBC  and then they  they cry  and they scream  and two weeks later  we get back in touch  two weeks later 
[02:30:00]  you let them hang on the line  for two weeks  yeah  on the way  and we interview people  on the way out of the funerals  oh my gosh  and we keep the little tykes  in a special room  you take care of the little tykes  right  yes  we have  we have people we hire  that will breastfeed them  okay good  and do that initial bonding  ah yeah  initial bonding  and then  the kid goes back  to the family  the initial bonding  yeah but we're gonna do it  in a bunch of hospitals  then just show all the episodes  yeah 
[02:30:30]  it's cool  yeah  it's called  your baby's dead  and the last d is tipped  almost like a half a smile  like oh no  wow  i can picture the logo  your baby's dead  it's just a prank show  we have  we have different  it's just an innocent prank show  yeah but like one  there's a fire  and then the other one  where all the parents  are in the waiting room  we hire an actress  to play a nurse  and she goes  oh  and then we 
[02:31:00]  the parents run to the window  and there's a lion  and we put fake blood  in all the bassinets  and the lion  has a little diaper  in his mouth  and the nurse is like  i don't know what happened  i went to get a marmalade  and when i came back  the babies had been eaten  and what's the big reveal  is there like a big tagline  like you've just been punked  oh yeah  um  oh it's  come on  lighten up  here's your kid  oh my god  i love it 
[02:31:30]  yeah  i'd watch that  yeah  and then there's the one version  the holiday version  where what we do is we get  someone who has a miscarriage  and then when they go like  oh i'm so upset  we're like  ah he's fine  and then  oh my god  jesus  that's not good  nbc  and then the big reveal  oh  that all is not well  your baby's dead  yeah  what it's called 
[02:32:00]  yeah  that's good  i like that  i think in the o for your  you have like a big tear  coming out of like the face  or like an open mouth  like oh  yeah yeah  oh  i'm all shocked  yeah  that's a good one  i think that'll be a great show  yeah  nbc huh  yeah  i'm trying to get  yafit kodo to host  and i want to get big celebrities  to play the nurses  and the doctors  yeah  yeah  and they come out  and tell the people  that they're  you know  this way  this way like 
[02:32:30]  the woman  we're like  your baby's dead  oh my god  you look like kathy bates  who's on your short list  kathy bates  who else  kathy bates  would be the nice one  taylor swift  tina fay maybe  she's  they love her at nbc  nah tina fay  no  i don't want to use her  no  she's too popular  taylor swift isn't  taylor swift  has an underground following  i don't think on tv  they'll know who she is  just put a different like  uh hairstyle on her  yeah  and people think like  what if they recognize 
[02:33:00]  i'll be like  they'll be too grief stricken  yeah true  they're not gonna think  they think their baby's dead  they're not gonna care  you should get some of your  celebrity friends like  ricky gervais  yeah your baby's dead  sorry  there's been a death up there  yeah  sorry  death in the nursery  yeah get the fire version  you got the fucking lion  ate all the kids  well a lion  how did a lion get into the  the little nursery area  there's um  we set it up where all the 
[02:33:30]  parents are coming in  in the back  there's a  a fucking  like a lion cage  parked  parked  because they're having a circus  in the parking lot  parked  yeah  i didn't know you could  park a lion cage  yeah you park a lion cage  it's supposed to be uh  it's a circus  oh a circus is going on  in the hospital parking lot  yes to honor all the new babies  oh  and ironically  the lion gets loose  how does the lion get loose though  they don't  they don't say  how does he get up the elevator  that's a good question 
[02:34:00]  that's a very good question  nobody will ask that  in the time of grief  no they'll just be so  grief stricken  he puts his five buttons  and  yeah he gets in  that's right  a nurse's hat is missing  and now  like they see the lion  he's wearing like a  a tattered nurse outfit  so they know what happened  he pretends  like he's ledger in batman  yes  that's all the babies  pause  and you could have um  a ceiling collapse perhaps  where they're all underneath  a bunch of uh  eye beams and rubble  a lot of rubble  rubble 
[02:34:30]  yeah  that'd be a good one  the father's handed out cigars  when we come out  we go you might want to  put those away  that gets some laughs  yeah  yeah you might want to  put those away  your baby's got rubble on them  if I see him  he'll have to say  no we incinerated him  because  incinerated  we had to get the room  cleaned up  they moved fast  yeah we did  we incinerated  we shuffled everything out  and threw it in the incinerator  that's a hell of a show 
[02:35:00]  yeah  this sounds like a big budget  is this primetime NBC  it is yes  to be rerun  after what show  at the 10pm  10pm  five nights a week  your baby's dead  five nights a week  can you imagine  can you imagine the outrage  oh god  oh would that be bad  that's what he's like  yeah  hmm  oh man  alright  I think it would be a good show  but again the kids are fine

[03:10:00]  go out of my way  to touch him  there I was just  putting my dick  in his general head area  so that you enjoyed more  I didn't enjoy  any of this today  that's fine  enjoy it  we got two more guys  two more  two more guys  yeah I lost  two more for Sal  well is the guy here  Diane  oh my god  we're getting fucking  stood up  this is such bullshit  you think we're getting  stood up by gay guys  what's next up  what's gonna happen next  well  he's not almost here  I heard 20 minutes ago 
[03:10:30]  45 minutes ago  what's next though  on the list  we're still doing this part  let's come into it  we're still gonna do  two more lap dances  right guys  sure  didn't they  get through that  no two more  they all have to do  the same thing  so I guess Sal  has to continue  yeah  I honestly  can't see  these guys  not just doing  everything  that's what I said  I think  it's money involved  that's exactly what I said  I don't know  did you see  number 8  come back 
[03:11:00]  dice  what the fuck  come back  oh boy  don't leave  come back  I don't know  I don't know  what's going on here  we need a lap dance  we don't know  what's going on  we need a lap dance  there you go  sit down  I'm surrounded  dice is at governors  this weekend  what's the matter  if you don't come back  in between  balls in the face  and tickling on pitch  yeah she keeps saying  any minute  any minute  she absolutely  said  you know  that he'll be here 
[03:11:30]  alright  you know what  we should  because no one's  going to tap out  over just one dance  alright  you got it buddy  you got this  me and you  we got to double the gay  two person dance  I'm sorry  dice  dice is  you got this  you said you were  the one that was  going to step up  you wanted to be bronze  who does dice  I didn't want to do  any of this  I have to show you  how it's done  now get out there  and finish the dances  double the dick  makes it double gayer  get out there and dance  double the price  wait it's pretty obvious  that they're not going to  tap out with the lap dance 
[03:12:00]  so we could move on  to some lap dancing  slash dry humping  and there's over the pants  fondling too  one of the other things  we could do  is  the entertainer  the entertainer  is supposed to remove  their clothes  and then swap underwear  with them  right  I'm just saying  that's something  we haven't done yet  Sal you would do that  because you're not  actually touching them  yeah but that's  I don't know  what the fuck  these guys got  what part of 
[03:12:30]  swapping underwear  would be  they would take  off each other's  underwear  right  of course  yeah I mean  I'm not afraid  to get naked  in the studio  apparently  but it's just  I don't want to  put their fucking  underwear on  how about if you  just smell it  or they smell you  smell it  they can smell mine  I don't give a fuck  alright fair enough  there we go  see that we moved  things right along  yeah  that's the show  let's get back  on track guys  Jesus  get back on track  we've gotten wayward  poor guy's just  waiting for his lap dance  I know right  he's sitting there  what's that 
[03:13:00]  what are we doing here  come on  come on Sal  you want to move  on to another one  Sal's shaking his head  yeah the lap dance  thing's not going to work  no that ain't going to  get him  we know they'd all  make it through that  the energy is really  waning  I know  our performer's  blown us off  yeah  getting stood up  by a good guy  again  well  he's two hours late 
[03:13:30]  I know  he's not showing up  no I know  okay  we're just sitting here  eating bread  over the  over the  underwear  mutual  fondling  that sounds good  over the  over the underwear  that means  you gotta shove  your hand down  the front of his  pants  I gotta say  Sal looks like  he's having a  nervous breakdown  there's something  in his eyes  that isn't  you alright Sal 
[03:14:00]  no I'm not  he's bringing up  some feelings  huh  no  I couldn't even  touch the guy  without dry heaving  what do we do  what do we do  well I don't know  the exchange of  underwear and smelling  them can be funny  how about this  I think that they  should have had  two dancers but  you never talk  but it's one of  those things you  live and learn  because if we  would have had  two it might  have been too  much  it's just  unreliable  I don't want  I don't want  Troy to take  away from Sal's  bit  the worst is yet  to come  this is ONA's  worst of 2013 
[03:14:30]  so far  on the O.P.  Anthony channel  O.P.  Anthony's worst  of 2013  so far  continues right  now  and yet  now  now  how about this  maybe this  we have to  improv a little  it's getting  late  so Sal  doesn't want  to do  anything  how about  would Sal  be willing  to pull  the side  of his  thong aside  maybe Troy  and then  these guys 
[03:15:00]  have to do  like a little  nose brush  against the  ass cheek  against the  ass cheek  or the  asshole  not the  asshole  the asshole  but the  asshole  will be there  the asshole  will be there  but no  you're not going  to touch it  well  it's talking  right now  wait a minute  that's me  bear cocksucker  oh jesus  jeffy  garbage  go home  so uh  they don't touch  your asshole  they just touch  the outside  the cheek  what's the big  deal about a  cheek 
[03:15:30]  your asshole  is spread  right there  and they go  the nose  lightly brushed  over the cheek  how about we  go for cock  handshake  well that's  going to be  coming up  sword fights  we got to  do something  what's a  cock handshake  you want to  do some  you shake  each other's  cocks like  it's uh  their hand  no i'm not  touching anyone  else's dick  like how do  you do  we'll allow  you to wear  gloves  he's stuck  in traffic  no no no  gloves  it's  it's  no  we'll allow  you to wear  gloves  i don't want

[03:28:00]  seconds  kissing the  armpit  of another  contestant  a little  armpit  kissing  is completely  harmless  but I think  that there's  four contestants  and I think  they can kiss  each other's  armpits  why not  it's a  gay off  can we get  a train  going on  you know  what  fucking  try  hey  you know  what  there we  go  we put our  heads together  we're going to  get this shit  back on track  let's get this  show back on  track guys  we can figure  it out  how do we go 
[03:28:30]  from that  to what  you're suggesting  well  we can just  have a dance  off or something  then the other  one lifts up  the other  one so that  one's licking  one while the  other's getting  licked  and then we'll  go in a circle  a daisy chain  it's all random  it's all fair  that's a great idea  everyone gets to  enjoy themselves  I'm walking around  with his bag  his bag's hanging  out of the side  do you know  how great this is  no  I actually don't  oh my god  I think we  officially lost Dice  oh of course we did  yeah Dice 
[03:29:00]  he couldn't put up  with that  yeah  alright what are we  doing  hi Sal  good job buddy  not really  what are we doing  so what are we doing  let's get everybody  let somebody run  the show  let's go  everybody get in  you don't even need  that yet  that will kill the taste  I want natural  man flavor  so Sal should be the body  you should be the top then  that way  no this is all  within contestants  nothing to do with us  yeah yeah  Sam 
[03:29:30]  Sam  they're all gonna be  in a circle  it's insane Sam  yeah  yes  four of them  smelling and licking  four men  being men  like the old days  everyone arms up  arms up  yeah  you should be  more of a circle  are we filming  oh my god  why not  hopefully not  why are we not  filming this  put your head near him  don't start yet  you put your head near  no no  you put your head  oh my god  Sam  put your head near his pit  somebody film it  Sal film it  somebody  there's the camera  there you go on there 
[03:30:00]  Sal that means he's not gonna do anything else  this would be easier  hold on  no no no  you don't stand in a circle  you just  how are we supposed to see that  you're not huddling  if they're not in a circle  one of them isn't gonna  yeah  then only two of them  are gonna get the full enchilada  no  one  lick  next one lift  lick  yeah they don't have to be  they're not huddling  oh you don't wanna do it at the same time  no who cares  oh I thought we were doing it all at the same time  no you just line them up  like  and it could be a big circle  we have to see what's happening  so we can describe it  how about one starts and licks  all of them down 
[03:30:30]  and then it goes around  there you go  how long per each person  15 seconds  but it has to be full licking  and putting your face in there  yeah  each person  yeah  each person then you go down  and then it starts back around  he's here  okay  who's here  oh here he is  oh my god  gogo's here  gogo's here  gogo's fine  I know I'm sorry  hi gogo  hi how's it going  should I get naked now or  hurry  that's the attitude we need in here  oh my god  we all had to step up here  fill it in for you buddy 
[03:31:00]  there's been a lot of improv  and uncomfortable behavior so far  yeah I see is that poo or is that chocolate  on him  bronzer  that's bronzer  because not all gays like poo  and I would be one of those  that's just bronzer  it's just bronzer  okay  nice  nicely done  yeah  looking good right  yeah  well welcome to the show  thank you  gogo harder  thank you so much  sorry I was um  I had to fluff myself  and it just took longer than I thought  oh well  all right  oh okay  serious let's do it  it's showing the rope  okay  all right  oh man  his nipples are pierced

[03:42:00]  no these guys are professional  fifteen hundred dollars at stake  i really would have thought  somebody would have tapped out  no  why would they  for that mild behavior  what's left there sir  i mean  you're right  if we  if we pour  we're going to tap out  they're going to go the distance  what about on me  what about  yeah  don't you have chocolate syrup  yep  yeah  should we pour some  chocolate syrup on the go-go  break that shit  i had time for breakfast this morning

[03:50:30]  i'll kiss  whatever i'll kiss  there you go  if he won doesn't mean he could have bailed on the kissing  it doesn't matter  what the fuck's going on  he chose to kiss  i keep thinking this is a nightmare  like it's not really happening  i'm having a nightmare  that guy just  he just tapped  long time  what's your name again the trucker  adam tapped  he tapped because  the other dude wanted to make out with him  because he volunteered for it  good strategy then

[03:51:30]  so far  far  far  continues right now  all right what the fuck  what's left  all right  um  what's left  not a shred of dignity  here's the thing  sorry  can't let it go on my arm jimmy  it's so uncomfortable  i'm trying to talk to you  you're being shy  no  troy you thinking uh dance off  dance off i don't know  dance off i mean we have all these props  i like sam's idea of the double dildos 
[03:52:00]  yeah  we have not no  no  what can we do with the dildos  do you know any good dildo games  what's that  do you know any good dildo games  well all of them involve going up my ass  so i don't really know  how about uh  something that's on the list here  a little toe sucking  toe sucking  that's a nice icebreaker  let's do some toe  i think we  i agree  oh sorry  i think toe sucking is important  we need to do something where  it starts to 
[03:52:30]  fucking move  yeah let's move  exactly  we got two out  toe sucking  and then they have to like massage oil into my cock  that sounds great  that sounds great  that sounds great  that sounds great  that sounds great  that sounds great  okay  cool  how about  well  what the fuck  are they allowed to jerk them off  is that okay  it's a massage  it's a massage  it's not jerking off  no  it's a massage  it's a massage  can i make a suggestion  sure 
[03:53:00]  uh oh  contestant on contestant  toe sucking  what are we going to get to do with him  that's why he's here  no no  he's got  yeah he's the performer  go go harder show  go go  no  like  like you came in  you already stuck each other's toes  why would a contestant suggest contestant on contestant  i know why  i know why  why  because he's trying to use the same strategy  and hoping that the other guy  taps out  not gonna happen  no  he's good cheeks  uh  jimmy's  jimmy likes your cheeks go go  okay so let's  i did squats yesterday 
[03:53:30]  so  let's do a little bit of uh  what do you think  should it be uh  contestant on contestant  or contestant on you  no contestant on him  well they gotta suck toes  and then do an oil massage  okay i got an idea  contestant on him  i think his shoes off  we'll get ready  why don't we take one of the dildo  the dildo  put it between his legs  right  or put it here  and have them blow the dildo  and play with his actual balls  oh that's right  see always a good solution  compromise is important  wait what's happening  what about the oil  why don't we do that next  oil massage first  oil massage first  you start with the oil massage 
[03:54:00]  it's like being on the titanic  wait what happened  alright so right now  this is crazy  we could have sal with the dildo between his legs  no i i i'm good  no because sal's not gonna want his balls manipulated  sal's nauseous in the corner  sal's been shaken to the corner  right now the contestants are gonna suck gogo's toes  as they should  as they massage him with oil  and then they're gonna massage his dick with oil  and then  when they're sucking each other's toes  can they play with each other's balls  no they're gonna suck his toes  okay  but they're sucking his toes 
[03:54:30]  but then they'll play with each other's balls  of course they can  okay  Troy has really stepped up to it  yeah he's really done well  Troy  you know  somebody's gotta take the reins  I hear you  okay  so you wanna sit down gogo  some people don't believe Troy  when he says he's down for whatever  yeah  okay so the way it's gonna work is  you're gonna suck his toes  while playing with the other contestants  how do we get E-Rock involved with this  why don't they both suck each foot  at the same time  at the same time  and then they'll play with each other's ball  there'll be ball manipulation the entire time  wait she's not happy over there  you alright with this 
[03:55:00]  it's the same forever  like there's more discussion than action  I agree  thank you  Lot is right  more discussion  if you're gonna give us a show  give us a show  come on  too much fucking chatter  she's right  yep  I agree  get all those toes  get all those tootsies  alright gentlemen  get down there  be good boys  oh sure  quiet  you're ruining my mood  okay  so  you guys know what you're doing  so you're gonna  you're gonna suck his toes  and then you're gonna play with each other's balls 
[03:55:30]  while you're doing it  have we established a time  one minute  one minute  oh  Troy knows time  I feel like  the stakes aren't high enough though  cause it's not um  I agree  I agree  I feel like they should have to touch my dick  I think so too  I think so too  alright  alright let's go right to the  bring over the dildo  let's have them oil massage his dick first  oil massage  okay  he's feeling tense  can they both suck his toes  and oil massage his dick  I mean  there's no reason  these are not mutually exclusive things  suck his toes  start 
[03:56:00]  go all the way up  and then  they'll manipulate  there you go  give each of them a little  a massage  maybe they should do it one at a time  a little oil in their  hands  so that one guy doesn't get any more dick  than the other  they start arguing  yeah but they'll just  they'll just swap off  see Lon's right  Lon's mad again  more talking  more discussion than actual action  that's cause we're slightly unorganized sweetheart  like we're figuring it out as we go  yeah  Troy are you annoyed?  what's that?  are you annoyed?  well because I said this to the god damn meeting  I said these guys are gonna do this  right  this is fucking nothing  it's fun 
[03:56:30]  we're already having it on  no I know  but this is easy stuff  let's go  yeah  Troy is right on this one  half the big guys have already tapped out  yeah but look at these guys are fucking in for the haul  somebody's gonna have to get fucked in their ass  or blow this dude  in order to fucking win  I was just gonna say  what if we lubed up the dildos  and just like  kind of press them against their holes for a while  can't do that  maybe a little just to touch  I don't know  we can't do anything  instructionalized  we're unallowed  let's just start with the kissy 
[03:57:00]  I don't see any legs being kissed  let's suck toes guys  fucks it around  get in there and suck some toes  lollygagging  and then we're gonna go on up  go ahead  get in there  Troy describe the action  okay  and get in there real good with the toes  gotta get in between  in between the toes  don't worry about  I do not have fungus  come on guys  get in there  there's a little glitter  can you guys reach over  and then be playing with each other  at the same time  come on  there's glitter on gogo's toes  alright come on guys  get a little closer to each other  come on  get a little closer  alright good  good  maybe put your arm around it

[04:09:30]  at the Robin Bird show  this Saturday  Robin Bird still around  yeah  Robin Bird does this  really big  kind of burlesquey show now  so it's not as  it's not like  as strippery  hardcore  I'm also not a porn star  just so we're all clear  but I do like sex  so  were you the contortionist  dude that was on our show  two weeks ago  no no  that was  Trooper Bousquet  but yeah  anyway she does this  great show  there's lots of  really beautiful girls  I know right  oh sorry  that's okay  but yeah 
[04:10:00]  so I'm there  every other Saturday  and you can check it out  tickets are at  thecuttingroom.com  yeah  and GogoHarder.com  or GogoHarder  on twitter  how old is Robin Bird  I'm in shock  I don't know  I do not know  she goes way back  but you're definitely  a trooper  definitely a professional  he came right in  and just took the reins  he's hilarious  yeah very funny  very funny  what do you think  to wrap this contest up  this is  it's Gogo's decision right  I would say so  unless you want to see  something else I guess  is there anything else  that would help  we got about 10 minutes  with your decision 
[04:10:30]  really  yeah  how about this  we got a lot of live reads  is it possible  now these guys  have done some kissing  for both guys to kneel  and for Gogo to stand  over them  and slap them on their  closed mouth  with his cock  of course  it's possible  anything's possible  that's fair  yeah that's fair  okay let's try that  let's see if anybody  can handle that  I don't think Anthony  can handle that  I know  I think Anthony's  fighting a lot of feelings  it's okay  he won't even let me  touch him  he won't leave a scrub
