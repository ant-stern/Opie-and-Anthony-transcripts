<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts’ return from vacation, immediately diving into Jimmy Norton’s recent nasal surgery.  Norton detailed the comedically disastrous results, including a terrible mustache, significant swelling, vomiting, and sleep deprivation due to congestion. He also discussed complaints about his new, oddly-timed voicemail recordings.  Anthony Cumia recounted a disastrous pool party, featuring excessive alcohol consumption, widespread property damage (including a broken ice luge), a landscaper pushing him fully clothed into the pool (damaging his iPhone), his mother’s accidental head injury, Sal’s questionable admiral costume and karaoke performance, and Norton's subsequent iPhone water damage woes.  The segment also briefly touched upon the deaths of Bernie Mac and Isaac Hayes, the Beijing Olympics (including Michael Phelps' success, the controversy surrounding Chinese gymnasts' ages, and a lip-syncing scandal), and Pervez Musharraf's resignation from the Pakistani presidency.  Danny and Tim were present in the studio along with occasional callers.

The discussion then shifted heavily to the Beijing Olympics.  The hosts repeatedly replayed a graphic video of a Hungarian weightlifter dislocating his elbow, highlighting the announcers' reactions.  Bob Costas's commentary was criticized, as were Usain Bolt's celebratory actions.  A caller brought up a New York Post blind item alleging a violent rape and payoff involving a "summer movie hunk," prompting speculation (potentially about Matthew McConaughey).  Jimmy called in again, this time using a heavily affected voice to detail his post-surgery pain.  Other topics included the Yankees' poor performance, Brett Favre joining the Jets, a video of a Burger King employee bathing naked in a sink, and a clip of a 91-year-old Ernest Borgnine jokingly whispering his secret to longevity ("I masturbate a lot").  A caller, Steve, promised a Rascal Flatts song later in the show.

The next segment opened with a discussion about the absence of E-Rock and the quieter studio atmosphere.  The hosts then moved on to insensitive jokes about the Russia-Georgia conflict, before focusing on Steve and his girlfriend's frustration over his reluctance to sing.  The hosts pressured Steve into performing a song from his band, Foundry, live on air, followed by listener feedback and a one-sided phone call to Steve's girlfriend.  Confusion and chaos ensued involving the studio staff, particularly "Iraq," regarding printed lyrics for a Rascal Flatts song, "I'm Moving On."  Steve eventually performed "I'm Moving On" and "She Left Me For Jesus," both generating further commentary.

Dr. Michael Bodden, a forensic pathologist, and a colleague appeared as guests.  Their conversation covered determining causes of death (particularly suffocation),  high-profile cases (including Sid Vicious, John F. Kennedy, and O.J. Simpson), issues with the Kennedy autopsy (unauthorized individuals, missing brain), and the complexities of presenting forensic evidence to a jury.  The discussion continued into the following segment with Dr. Michael Baden, another forensic pathologist. This segment began with a rambling discussion about the location of Robert F. Kennedy's brain, before moving into a critique of forensic television shows. They discussed low murder solve rates (particularly in post-Katrina New Orleans), the smells of autopsy rooms, the use of Vicks VapoRub, "body farms," and the Pope's disapproval of using bodies in car crash simulations. Dr. Baden detailed cases including John Belushi's death (heroin and cocaine overdose), TWA Flight 800, deaths during police restraint, the O.J. Simpson trial, the Phil Spector trial, the Klaus von Bülow case, and the Terri Schiavo case.  He also dismissed cryogenics as "bullshit."  Peter Dean, a British coroner, joined via phone, discussing the UK coroner system, deaths of British citizens abroad (including Kenya), and Princess Diana's death.  A possible Bigfoot autopsy was briefly mentioned.


The final segment began with a tangential discussion about Bigfoot and the Piltdown Man hoax.  A caller, Alex, asked about organ donation and kidney transplants, prompting a discussion about ethical considerations and the Mickey Mantle liver transplant.  Dr. Pardon, a medical examiner, was in studio to answer these questions.  After Dr. Pardon's departure (and a brief book promotion), the hosts spoke with Dr. Pardon and Peter, a forensic photographer specializing in tattoos on deceased individuals. Their conversation covered the types and meanings of tattoos (including prison tattoos), methods of execution and their associated pain levels, and graphic details of tattoos on genitalia, beheading videos, and the state of bodies.  The show concluded with discussions about upcoming guests (Norm Macdonald, Rainn Wilson, Michael Phelps), speculation about their appearances, and playful, sexually suggestive banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And that's how we begin.  Why would it work after a week?  Why would it work?  Why would it work?  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  V.  Ah.  It was A, not B.  Thank you, Tim.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  Someone had to switch it during the time we were off, I guess.  Yeah.  For some reason.  For what reason?  Who knows?  Switched.  Well, well, well.  Our first live show in, I don't know, ten days or something like that.  Nine days.  How long?  Well, yeah.  You do the five, then the two, and then the other two, and it adds up to nine.  Got about the weekend.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony, 877-212-ONA.  Back from vacation.  Yes.  My first observation, Jimmy grew a vacation mustache, and I hate it. 
[00:01:00]  I absolutely hate it.  It's a hit.  It's a sensation.  A sensation.  Is it?  It really is a scream, I like to say.  It's, uh, it's, it's...  You're not really a mustache guy.  Sure am I.  It's a gentleman's mustache, and everybody else is a little jealous I don't have him.  That's all it is.  Yeah.  I walked into the Comedy Center last night, Esty laughed in my face.  She really laughed.  Did she? 
[00:01:30]  I mean, howled at me.  Shave off that mustache!  Everyone's taking pictures of Jimmy's mustache.  His mustache.  I wanted it just to look cheesy.  Yeah.  I'm a goatee man, and every once in a while I go, you know what, I'm going to come in to  work with a mustache, and then I shave it down to the mustache, and then I shave the mustache  off.  I'm not brave enough to take the final step and come in here with just a mustache.  The worst is that people won't just laugh, because it is meant to be horrible.  Yeah.  And like, this girl I know, she's dating this comedian, Kurt, that I know. 
[00:02:00]  So I see her at the center last night, she goes, oh, I like that.  And I actually went, no, you don't.  No, you don't.  You can't.  Right.  She's like, but it looks nice.  I'm like, it doesn't look nice.  It's awful.  Just tell me it looks awful.  It's fine.  See, if you do a little soul patch like Ant's doing, then you can pull it off there.  Oh, yeah.  But just the mustache, forget about it.  No, I like...  When are you shaving?  I've been working mine, trimming, and trimming a little top so it's not as thick.  You know, I don't want to groucho marks.  So, you know, you've got to figure out the mustache. 
[00:02:30]  It's fun.  It's a fun adventure, I like to say.  Well, it is.  Is it really?  Where will it take me?  When are you shaving?  By seven?  I'm debating it.  I almost did yesterday.  I'm like, no, I got it.  Because the worst is people in my building, they all have to see me with this cheesy thing  walking around.  And they probably think, does he really think he looks handsome?  Handsome.  I had him on stage with this last night.  It was really embarrassing.  Because when people are looking at me, they probably think, like, that's his new look.  You got to get to Friday.  Can you make it to Friday? 
[00:03:00]  Probably not, no.  Because there's nothing worse than when you don't see someone for ten days and they show  up with a mustache.  Yeah.  Like, it's my new look.  And I hear that you're still a little clogged from your nose job.  Yeah, I will.  I'm calling it a nose job.  Nose job.  I got it actually nose added to me.  I want it to look mysterious.  That's how Jimmy spent his vacation.  He had his nasal surgery, finally.  Yeah.  So that means you're not going to bitch about it anymore, right?  Please.  Please say no more bitching about the dumb nose.  I'm still very congested. 
[00:03:30]  But again, I will be for weeks.  It's like, until it just shrinks and the swelling goes down.  Yeah.  But yeah, I mean, the guy went in, he sliced the inside of my nose.  He said there was a lot of loose bone.  Ugh.  Somebody was, like, hooked.  He said I had a lot of extra cartilage and bone.  And then they shrink your turbinates, which means they put a needle in these things in  your nose and they heat them and they shrink.  Oh, ha.  Yeah.  Ow.  What a bitch.  And then, were you in pain when you woke up?  I was.  I actually puked. 
[00:04:00]  Ooh.  The surgery was nothing.  I couldn't believe how easy this whole thing was.  Yeah?  I couldn't believe how fast to recover it was.  But I woke up and I think we talked about the anesthesia.  It's like, you're laying there and I walk you in the operating room so you feel empowered.  And they said that so you don't feel like you're helpless.  And it's like 50 degrees and you lay down and the IV is in my arm.  And I start to feel loopy.  Oh, no.  And my doctor is singing and I'm like, you guys put something in there, right?  Ha, ha, ha. 
[00:04:30]  You put something in there.  And, uh.  You dolt.  That's hysterical.  He went, yes, we did.  And the next thing I know, I'm looking at him in the recovery room.  That is creepy.  Yeah, that's time machine stuff.  True time travel.  Because, yeah, it really is.  You have no sense of how long you were anywhere.  You just wake up.  Hi.  No dreaming.  Nothing.  You put something in this.  I can see the lights.  But it wasn't a nauseous spinning.  It was just like, the room was like, and that's how you die right there. 
[00:05:00]  It really is.  You got a chance of seeing death.  If you die.  That's how it is.  Simple as that.  If you die on that table.  You would never know.  The last thing you would remember, quote, remember is that you put something in here, didn't you?  Yes, I did.  You wouldn't remember that either.  I know.  You're right.  See, that's nothing.  Puked a little blood, and that's it.  I saw you the day after your surgery, and did you notice I was kind of awkwardly talking to you?  I was trying to be cool, but Jimmy looked like a completely different person, and it was freaking me out as I was trying to talk to him about his surgery and how it was. 
[00:05:30]  Did you notice, or were you still kind of loopy from the whole thing?  I was still a little bit out, because at that point I was taking painkillers, which I took very minimal.  But it was the day after, I think.  I thought, wow, you were just distorted.  Yeah, my lip was all swollen.  I took pictures.  I don't think it did it justice, to be honest with you.  I looked crazy.  I looked like a...  Yeah.  I looked like this.  You had this about him.  Oh, I want to see those pictures.  Have you ever seen them? 
[00:06:00]  No.  Oh, I got to see that.  They're awful.  They just don't look like you.  No, they're up on onaradio.com, and Jim Norton's mustache picture will be up there shortly.  Is that why you started growing the mustache?  What?  To hide the...  No, his face looks normal now.  I couldn't shave.  No, I mean, is that why you started?  Oh, no, no.  I was just too much pain to shave.  Oh, okay.  You know the face you got made when you shave?  Oh, you got...  You got to shave.  I couldn't do it.  I was in too much pain.  So, you know, swelling went down. 
[00:06:30]  I went to some Motorhead Sabbath and Priest, which was an amazing show.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Didn't you go like two days after?  Yeah.  I would have went the next day.  That's crazy.  I almost went to PNC the next day, but I was still having some bleeding, but I couldn't  believe it.  Just surgery.  Some spotting?  I really was.  I felt fat.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  So let's get healing.  I mean, let's see how it is in a couple weeks.  Yeah.  But I still sit sleeping up like the elephant man on my couch.  Aw.  I haven't been in my bed in 10 days.  Really?  Yeah, I can't because you can't lay down.  It's just too stuffy. 
[00:07:00]  You still can't lay down?  Nah.  I mean, I can for a moment, but laying down like that would just be...  I just wouldn't...  Like pins on a map of where you're going to go around the country with your best friend?  Yeah.  Can't lay down?  I have to put my red wig on something.  Blind girl thought on my face.  Oh, no.  Look at you.  That was after the surgery.  That was just me with the blood and the mustache.  You have to wear a mustache because you just...  This guy didn't pack my nose.  They don't put anything up your nose but gel.  So you're just basically bleeding of an open wound in your face until it collapses. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, God.  That is something, man.  Yeah.  I mean, we'll see how it turns out.  This is the doctor I was a complete dick to in that interview.  Yeah, I know.  He fixed you up.  Right.  That was great.  I mean, great surgeon.  There's no issues with the healing so far.  Just got to keep taking antibiotics for another week and I'm done.  Look at the difference in the nostrils.  The left nostril had a problem, huh?  That's the one he did most of.  I was actually glad to see the left one swollen because that's still where he made the incision.  Your nose has a lining over it. 
[00:08:00]  Put your finger in your nose and you feel like the lining on the wall of your nose bridge  inside.  Yeah, yeah.  And that's where he sliced it.  He peels the wall back and he slices all the bone out.  I have the x-rays.  He showed me how bad I was.  Really?  I was in bad shape.  Yeah, look at Jimmy.  There's the...  Why do you have so much bone in your nose?  I don't know.  I had a drill with a baseball when I was a kid.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, I got a drill in the face.  I think that messed me up.  I don't know if you can see that, but there's one old clip from the side. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, click the yellow one there, Danny.  My upper lip is bad.  Danny's sitting where E-Rock usually sits.  I like this move.  Where's E-Rock?  Thug brain with the strong move.  Oh, that's right.  Look at the side view of Jimmy.  Reallocating the assets.  Yes, absolutely.  Look at Jimmy.  Yes, yes.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh.  That was a duck-lipped fool.  Yeah.  It looked like those old women on the Upper West Side that wanted to get the collagen.  That's exactly what it is. 
[00:09:00]  It looked like that.  Oh, I look lovely.  Yeah, I felt like Joan Rivers afterwards.  Ninety-year-old women in miniskirts.  Look around those.  You were going to ask me for money?  Remember that in Midnight Cowboy when he bangs your lady?  Hey, we got Corey asking to play Jimmy's new voicemail message.  You were talking about Anthony's jacuzzi or something like that?  How cold the jacuzzi was?  They said it's hilarious.  Yeah.  Well, Corey says it's hilarious.  Too long.  It's a phone number, and you call into it as a fan of Jimmy's, and you get to hear what 
[00:09:30]  Jimmy's been up to, right?  Yeah, and I can hear your messages and stuff like that, and there's no money exchange.  You don't get charged or anything.  Now I only make the messages during decent hours, because I didn't realize if you call  from your home phone, that they'll actually ring you at three in the morning if that's  when I leave the message.  Oh, really?  Because I only did that once or twice, and then someone yelled at me.  I'm like, oh, I didn't realize.  So now I just call during the day, so you won't be bothered at night.  Waking people up at three in the morning.  That's hysterical.  You can choose to be notified, not at all, just when you check, or it can ring you, like 
[00:10:00]  you're getting a phone call.  Great.  Who's dead?  What is this?  Oh, it's Jimmy Norton.  Wait, so when you update this, it just rings to everybody?  It depends on what they choose.  If they choose...  But if they don't know that feature, it's just going to ring.  I think when you first call, they let you know easily.  If you chose to get a ring, it rings, or a ring-a-ding-ding.  It'll ring a ding-ding, or it will not notify you at all.  Whatever you want.  But yeah, I was making fun of Ant's Jacuzzi. 
[00:10:30]  Because it was nice.  It was a gorgeous Ant's place.  Yeah.  It was fantastic, but the Jacuzzi was a gazpacho.  It was a gazpacho.  I really, yeah, I got to crank that thing up.  I'm going to need a little lesson on how to get that Jacuzzi heated up.  It was lukewarm.  Oh, really?  It was...  And then it started getting warmer, and then the propane ran out, because that was the only  type of fuel I could use.  I'm going to change it over, though. 
[00:11:00]  You were bragging about how warm your pool was, and how the steam comes off the water,  but you couldn't figure that out for the Jacuzzi.  Well, then it starts cooling off when you're burning pretty much what the shuttle burns,  when it takes off.  Jesus.  It takes quite a while to heat up.  Yeah.  How was the rest of the party?  I made like an hour.  I had to go down to Philly for some stuff.  Dandy.  Lots of drinking.  Oh, my God. 
[00:11:30]  And then just the mess.  I don't think I'm...  There's supposed to be people coming over today to clean up the backyard.  How bad is the backyard?  It just looks like a bomb went off.  Yeah.  There's just broken bottles and booze laying all over the place, and like towels and clothes,  and just every square inch has booze gacks built on everything. 
[00:12:00]  It's just like...  You should have taken a picture of that.  You should have done a before and after picture.  Before and after.  That would have been hilarious.  I was just thinking like, I don't know, you know, 10 people.  That's a good party.  10 people.  You had well over 100.  Oh, yeah.  I was there.  And I was there early.  It was over 100 and...  And you've got a state-of-the-art backyard.  I mean, slate and fancy pools and jacuzis and firepicks.  That's Bluestone, my friend.  Bluestone, okay.  And now that's all just a mess? 
[00:12:30]  It's a mess.  It obviously has to be power-washed, and, you know, it was just...  You know, you have a party like that with that many people, it's going to be a mess.  It's just a disaster.  It was like an 80s movie college party.  Yeah, yeah.  Like when all the parents went away.  Exactly.  That's exactly what it looked like.  Like, uh-oh, we've got to clean this up.  They're coming home soon.  Yeah, and the nerdy parents are driving, and then they cut back to the party.  Like, woo, there's going to be a little risky business thing happening. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, it was just a mess.  I know there's a big, long table that they were using for food, and last I looked, there  was just half a cake on it.  The cake is still out there?  Oh, it's still out there with beer cans in it.  It's just a disaster.  You turned your house into a fraternity house in one day.  Oh, my God, it was.  Was the next day, was there still drinking during the next day?  No, no, that was just stay away. 
[00:13:30]  The guys came by to pick up the tables, and there was just crap all over the tables.  So I was like, I don't know, clear them off.  What do you want from me?  I'm not going out there and cleaning them.  So they had to clean off their own tables before they packed them up.  Unbelievable.  And then something, like when the ice luge melted.  Did you see the ice luges?  I didn't even see the ice luge.  Oh, the ice luge is like two little, it's an ice sculpture. 
[00:14:00]  No, my brother had.  With two little rivers carved in them.  Yeah, my brother had one of those at his wedding.  And you put your mouth down at the bottom, and they pour shots down.  And it chills it up by the time it goes down.  Well, during the night, apparently the ice luge melted and fell over and hit a bottle of Jaeger,  which just smashed and spilled all over the place.  And you know how easy Jaeger comes up?  Well, ice tends to melt in the summer there, Anthony.  Yeah.  He goes, apparently, I really thought it was going to survive the 85 degrees. 
[00:14:30]  Yes, Danny.  Well, I'm glad that you brought up the ice luge, because that was one source of entertainment  for me throughout the night, was watching some of the party goers kneel down and take  from this ice luge.  Because a lot of them were very on the other side of the age scale.  And they're wearing all their party gear, and they're just getting down on their knees  and opening.  Yeah, they were, you know, parents and family, stuff like that.  So, yeah, they're laying on their knees with their mouth open. 
[00:15:00]  It was quite the visual, but it was making me laugh all night long.  It was fantastic.  Oh, my dummy, dummy landscaper.  The guy that did all the landscaping in the backyard.  Is that Dr. Octopus?  Doc Ock.  That creep.  He's walking around with those sunglasses on.  What kind of sunglasses?  I don't even know.  Just awful?  They look like Doc Ock.  Yeah, they were orange.  Yeah, you should have had eight arms and showing some girl's flesh on their bones. 
[00:15:30]  Damn, it's a boob.  So, yeah, he had to be over the top guy and push me in the pool.  There's always one.  Which is like, you know, in this day and age.  I didn't know what he talked about before.  Watch what I'm going to do.  Watch me.  Watch me.  He's like, oh, I'll get him.  I'll get.  And it's like, in this day and age, everyone is walking around with electronic devices on them.  Now, that do not take well to water.  Who doesn't have some type of electronic communication device on them? 
[00:16:00]  And there I go.  Foosh.  Pushed right in.  I'm fully clothed.  I got my 511 boots on, which I think are going to dry sometime in December.  They'll be dry because they're thick, very, you know, padded.  But they were meant for war.  They should be able to dry out.  Well, you know, maybe if I marched in them.  Yeah.  In the sun.  But, you know, I'm just, the second I went in, I'm still underwater, you know, doing that swim up. 
[00:16:30]  Going.  Just in my head going, son of a bitch.  Oh, you bastard.  Were you doing your impression of Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate underwater?  No, I was getting out as quickly as possible, trying to salvage, you know, everything in my wallet, my phone.  And thank God I felt, I didn't feel I had to be armed at my own party because that would have sucked had I went in with my nice new Colt.  Those Polaroids from Taiwan. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  I'm trying to save those.  Can you replace those, can you?  Irreplaceable, Jim.  And, yeah, so I get my iPhone out of my pocket.  I thought it was quick enough.  But I start feeling the iPhone.  It's off.  And it's getting like one of those hand warmers that you take to a football game.  The thing got so blazing hot.  And then all of a sudden, it wasn't hot anymore.  And then it wouldn't turn on. 
[00:17:30]  It won't work.  It was done.  And I had to spend an hour online at Roosevelt Field Mall yesterday at the Apple Store.  To get a new one?  To get a new iPhone.  Yeah.  That's not going to be a good commercial for the iPhone.  Why?  They don't survive pools.  Well, you know something?  They also have something inside the iPhone that changes color if it gets wet.  Because the only thing they do not guarantee is dips in the pool or the toilet or anything else.  And apparently, a lot of people on that line yesterday, it was pool mishaps. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, really?  That, yeah.  Another person decided it was a great idea to throw someone the phone while they were in the pool.  It's like, hey, give me the phone.  No, I could catch it.  Bloop.  The old bloop.  And that was that.  Yeah, a lot of people at the Apple Store with phone mishaps in the pool.  Do you find when you sync it up with, like, I have it synced up with two different computers.  Like, if you have to make one the master, like, it will, like, do you want to sync up or do you want to make one of these the master and make them copy each other? 
[00:18:30]  And, like, if you make them copy each other, they double your phone numbers.  So, like, I have, like, some people, I have four copies of their number.  Why would that?  Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank.  Frank.  Let me call Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank.  I don't want four Frank's numbers.  Which Frank do I call?  Frank, Frank, Frank, Frank.  I don't want Frank four times.  I want him once.  How do you get rid of redundancies?  I have too many.  I can't stand the two-computer sync-up thing because it always goes to the one where I barely have anything on it. 
[00:19:00]  And I realize, oh, great, it's a new phone again.  And I've got to go to the other computer and sync that up.  Oh, it's really enraged.  Yeah.  I want to go with MobileMe.  MobileMe?  Yeah, it's that thing where you're, like, I know iPhone has that.  Oh, right.  I decided against it.  And I didn't know what it was.  It'll just go right through.  And if you push something up on your phone, all of a sudden, boom, it goes to your account.  Boom, it goes to your computer at home.  Nice.  It gives you an automatic sync-up so you don't lose your information.  That's pretty cool.  All right, listen, we're heading toward the first break here.  We're just getting warmed up.  We're back live to prove it.  It's Monday, August 18, 2008. 
[00:19:30]  It's a Monday, 877-212-O&A.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Want to say good morning to everybody.  Good morning to Boston.  I guess there was a little controversy up there.  They decided to play music instead of our best ofs.  I don't really understand that.  Whatever.  They know best.  That just confuses the audience.  Yeah, there was a lot of chatter about that while we were away. 
[00:20:00]  I don't get it.  Because we pick out some really, really good stuff.  Really good stuff.  Yeah, I don't look at that either.  It's like saying, all right, we don't have to play this show now, so we'll play it when we really want to.  That's how it feels.  Yeah.  Phone number 877-212-O&A.  We've got people checking in that we're at the big pool party at.  Oh, really?  Isn't Steve supposed to sing Foundry Today? 
[00:20:30]  Oh, wow, yes.  Really?  That's what someone is asking on the phone.  Oh.  All right, let's start with Charlie in New York.  Charlie.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  Good morning.  What's up?  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hey.  Hi.  If Anthony would have had Commando, Dice's phone, he would have been okay.  Remember, Dice was talking about his underwater phone or something like that.  Oh, right.  The underwater phone.  What did he have?  He came in recently.  Did he have an underwater phone?  What did he say something?  It goes underwater. 
[00:21:00]  I think he had some weird-looking phone, and he said that you could, I don't know, you could go underwater with it.  It's good underwater.  Yeah, what did he mean by that?  I don't know.  It wouldn't fry, maybe?  Maybe.  It was an industrial-looking phone.  We were laughing at him, but I was the one that needed a new phone.  Well, we're all about the bells and whistles, and in his case, he was excited because the phone can work underwater, and we're trying to tell Dice, but how would that ever really work?  You can't really just take phone calls underwater.  Yeah, because he wouldn't call it a waterproof phone. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  Which, you know, that makes sense.  Okay, it can be dunked in water and be fine.  He made it sound like you're using it underwater.  Yeah, what are you going to do?  Text him when I'm drowning.  Text him when I'm drowning.  But by the way, that guy that threw out in the pool, I was so annoyed when I saw him do it, because I thought he was Jill's brother, because beforehand he had thrown himself in the pool, and no one noticed.  Right.  Which was funny.  What do you mean he threw himself in the pool?  Did he jump in the pool with his clothes on?  He was a wacky guy?  He just jumped in and, yeah, decided he was going to be the over-the-top wacky guy. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  Then he throws Jill in, and then he picked her up and threw her while he was in the water, and she was fine with it.  But I'm like, that must be her brother, because who else would throw her in the pool?  Why would you do that?  Yeah, over-the-top guy would.  Yeah.  Then he put his towel on, and he just had to be wacky again and throw the other host in the pool.  And then I had to get thrown in.  He had a lot of confidence, this guy, huh?  Oh, Jesus.  Just assuming this was going to go down nice.  No, a lot of boos.  Oh, a lot of boos.  Is what he had.  A lot of boos. 
[00:22:30]  I don't remember.  I don't think so.  I'm going to leave a message the next day and go, sorry, I'm an ass.  I know I still owe him a little check that's going to have a deduction on it for an iPhone.  A new $5,000 iPhone that you had.  Exactly.  It's the information that was on there that was very important.  Let's say hi to Bobby in New York.  Bobby!  Yo, what's going on?  What's up, Bobby?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Listen, hey, I was wondering how Anthony's mother's doing. 
[00:23:00]  She was feeling pretty good by the end of the night.  Oh, yeah.  She was dancing around, and I think she slipped and conked her head.  Really?  And then she gets up and just starts dancing again.  Yeah, yeah.  And then Sal comes out in what could only be described as the most asinine costume I've  ever seen in my life.  It was perhaps the great, hold on, sir.  I'm sorry.  It was probably the greatest outfit I've ever seen a man wear intentionally.  Wait, he did a costume change? 
[00:23:30]  He put on a t-shirt with the printing of what an admiral in the Navy would wear on it.  Like, it just had, like, the shoulder things and a captain's hat and his belly, and he's  just dancing around like a lunatic.  He was wearing all white, and I thought he had an admiral's jacket on from across the  yard, but it was like one of those tuxedo suit shirts. 
[00:24:00]  It was the greatest outfit I've ever seen.  Yeah, it's like a tuxedo shirt, but only an admiral thing.  And then for some reason, he decided that the karaoke, that he should do patriotic songs  for some reason.  What was it?  What was it?  Like patriotic.  He was doing Star Spangled Banner, and then God Bless America, and I was like, Sal, what  are you?  Stop.  Was he hammered?  Probably.  He must have been.  One would hope.  One would hope. 
[00:24:30]  Coming out in his admiral suit.  Yeah, if he wasn't hammered, then he's ready for the hole.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot there, Bobby.  All right, Bobby.  Take it easy.  Yeah.  I missed a good party.  I went early.  When it was all cute, and girls walking around with the hors d'oeuvres, and everyone was  nice.  Yeah.  Basil Latisse.  Just very quiet.  Yeah.  That food was great, man.  Basil Latisse from Tom's River?  Yes.  Yeah.  Very, very good.  Yeah, you were there during the early part where it's still light out.  The easy part.  Everyone's just kind of, hey, how you doing? 
[00:25:00]  Hey, look who showed up.  A little shy socializing going on.  Before the end.  Before the booze kicks in.  Well, there's just a wreck.  And I know, me and Keith, Keith came over the next day to clean up some of the garbage  in front.  There were garbage bags in front that, I don't know, either someone ran them over or an animal  got at them.  There's just a pile of garbage bags in front of my house.  And that isn't even it.  That toilet in the back was really cool.  Oh, you called a jacuzzi. 
[00:25:30]  I can't tell you how many times in that jacuzzi.  What?  Oh, he kept saying that.  He goes, oh, oh, I just did it again.  I would be talking and all of a sudden I would just stop moving completely.  Like a baby.  Like one does.  Were you trying to make the water warmer?  It was fantastic.  At least 11 times.  Thank God.  Thank God it pours out pretty quickly.  That's funny.  You need to be sitting in your mess.  That was great.  Were the cops called?  Were the neighbors a problem? 
[00:26:00]  No.  Give me more on this party.  No problem with the neighbors.  The cops weren't called at all, even though I think the DJ was a blast in music until midnight.  Wow.  But no cops.  He was cool, the DJ, too, man.  He was like one of three songs you could choose from.  That guy didn't play games.  You want to hear the Kid Rock song again?  All right.  All right.  All right.  We got it.  He had a short playlist. 
[00:26:30]  I don't know.  I guess he was taking requests.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I hear that Kid Rock song again.  I'm going to just throw myself through the window.  By the end of the night, literally it was twice in a row.  All right.  What Kid Rock song?  The new one, All Summer Long.  Oh, with the Leonard Skinner riff.  Very nice.  All right.  We missed a lot on vacation.  People always die when we're away.  You lost Bernie Mac and Isaac Hayes.  Two guys.  You're kidding.  I don't think we ever had Bernie Mac on the show.  Maybe back in the day. 
[00:27:00]  But we certainly had Isaac Hayes on the show.  Yeah.  He was a great guest.  He died of a stroke.  Bernie Mac died of pneumonia.  Yeah.  Jeez.  That pneumonia will get you.  Got the pneumonia.  When you get that pneumonia, you got to get to the hospital immediately.  I heard he had problems with that, though.  He had other things going on.  Respiratory.  Stump brain.  What was the other thing that was wrong with Bernie Mac that he was dealing with?  He had sarcoidosis.  It's kind of a form of cancer that makes little bubbles on your organs.  It's horrible.  Ew. 
[00:27:30]  Holy mother of God.  Yeah.  It's a weird one.  And we have a friend in common.  How do they do that?  Do you just pop the bubbles somehow?  No, they chemo you.  And it's tough.  It beats the hell out of you.  And that's what compromised his immune system was the treatment for the sarcoidosis.  He got one form of pneumonia, went in the hospital in late July.  And while he was in there, he picked up another one.  And that's what took him out.  How do they know you have that?  I think you start getting zapped.  All your energy gets wiped out.  And they have to go in and do some kind of blood work. 
[00:28:00]  I hate when people have that as a symptom.  I've been tired for 12 years.  For the love of God.  You have al-kidosis.  Al-kidosis.  The weird part about the Bernie Mac thing.  Mr. Boogie Knight.  I was taking out that whole pool scene.  I'm like, I think I've got to call Anthony Mr. Boogie Knight now.  Boogie Knight?  Yeah.  Boogie Knight.  That's it?  Yeah.  I was going to tell you, Bernie Mac and Isaac Hayes are in the same movie with Sam Jackson. 
[00:28:30]  That's coming out.  Like within a couple days of each other.  So I wonder how Mr. Jackson's feeling.  Because it's Soul Man.  It comes out, I think, in October, November.  I just watched Sam Jackson again.  I was watching Coming to America last night.  I couldn't stop.  Eddie Murphy was goddamn funny, man.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, not that that's a shock to anyone.  But you forget how funny Eddie Murphy's movies are.  Yep.  Because now it's just Eddie Murphy and Eddie Murphy. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Can he play one role?  It's all kids' movies and stuff.  I was howling watching that last night.  Yeah.  We got your message about Anthony's party.  Oh.  Tim put it together.  Let's see how this sounds.  How long is it, though?  Is it too long?  We'll see.  If it's too long, we'll stop it.  It's embarrassing to have to listen to it.  I never listen to these.  I just talk and say.  Oh, you.  Hey, it's Norton.  It's about 6 o'clock on Sunday.  A couple things.  I'm on the Comedy Central, Bob's Jagger roast tonight, which starts, I think, 10 o'clock  here in New York.  So if you want to watch that. 
[00:29:30]  I don't know what they cut out of it.  I don't know what they do.  And I'm healing up much better.  Doing good.  The left nostril is still really clogged.  So I've been sitting up, sleeping like a creep.  Jim, do you need friends?  I'm very lonely.  Do you need friends?  But I just let people know how I'm doing.  This is really not a good selling point for this film.  But, you know, Tim, you should have got the highlights.  Tim just took out the curses.  I'm plugging the Comedy Central roast.  It was yesterday.  What'd you mention? 
[00:30:00]  Oh, Tim.  Sleeping like a creep for the last seven to eight days.  But thanks, you know, for the well-wishings.  It was nice to get all the messages and emails and stuff.  So I went to Ants yesterday.  Anthony's had his little get-together.  It was just a bunch of Alkies.  His stepdad, Sal, came out wearing an Admiral shirt.  You ever see a shirt with like a suit jacket shirt, but it's just a T-shirt?  This is what it was.  It was like an Admiral's outfit with like an Admiral's cap on. 
[00:30:30]  It was just a lunatic.  And we sat in Anthony's jacuzzi.  And the whole place is amazing.  It's like a multimillion-dollar house.  But I guess his propane tanks were running out.  So he has like a f***.  It was like a lube-warm jacuzzi.  It was the f***ing coldest jacuzzi on the East Coast.  I was so irritated.  We're sitting in gazpacho.  F***ing cold jacuzzi.  But everything else was great.  The food was great. 
[00:31:00]  The house was amazing.  Who cares?  Shut up.  Shut up, Jim.  Oh, we like this.  God almighty, my dullard.  The food was great.  Good food.  Plenty of it.  Good food.  Good friends.  How old am I, 80?  I like this.  The ornamentation was lovely.  I should be decapitated.  I like this, Jimmy.  Let his guard down a little bit.  The house was amazing.  And, you know, we had a good time hanging, of course.  Nice bric-a-brac. 
[00:31:30]  Bric-a-brac.  The liverwurst was a little soggy.  Oh, I should be stabbed.  Of course.  But his chili jacuzzi.  I wanted to drop a deuce in it so bad.  It's a nice f***ing freezing jacuzzi.  It's a f***ing fric.  All right, well, we're on tomorrow, so hopefully I'll get to tease my buddies.  F***.  Ice cold.  F***.  Chilled soup.  Water-to-water jets kept stopping.  Because it's beautifully built, but it's just powered by these jets. 
[00:32:00]  And he'd probably get drunk one night and left them on, so they kept running out of power.  Stupid Keith, the cop kept coming over and turning them back on.  And it was just really enraging.  All right.  Well, that was the whole run of it.  Just go and watch the Comedy Central thing tonight.  Watch us all take a nice big f***ing Bob Saget's mouth.  And all right.  I guess that's it.  I'm on the radio tomorrow.  Tee-hee.  Oh, God.  Yes.  That's funny.  So I understand we're sending Tim to highlighting college. 
[00:32:30]  I don't think I understand what parts of a college is.  What a highlight is.  No kidding.  There's a lot to choose from on that one.  I kind of liked that.  Yeah, that was fun.  We've got to listen to those from time to time.  Drew, New York, what's up?  What's up, bro?  Hey.  I always say, good morning, gentlemen.  Hey, buddy.  I always enjoy hearing when people die from what I have.  Jeez.  Wait, you have what Bernie Mac had?  Yeah, they're circaduses.  I found out they had a big tumor in my neck, and they cut the front of my neck open all 
[00:33:00]  the way back to my spine, switched my head back, and pulled the tumor out.  Were you awake?  Is your doctor Elzark Howey?  Yes.  It was a human Pez dispenser.  They sew you up nice?  No, they glued it all back together.  You can't hardly tell.  Glued it all back together.  They used crazy glue.  The guy says, don't look up. 
[00:33:30]  I'm like, okay, gotcha.  And I was stood at the ground for like three weeks.  Ah, he's a card, that doctor.  And you're doing all right now, sir?  No, but, you know, what are you going to do?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  You got it.  There's no cure.  And you just go forward.  They left a bunch of tumors in my chest.  But I think that's what Tom has, too.  Tom from White Plains has that as well.  I believe you're right.  Is that why you can't breathe?  I guess.  Yeah, it goes after your lungs. 
[00:34:00]  So can't they do anything for it?  No, when it gets bad, they put you on steroids.  But they say that's like a short-term fix.  So they're leaving me alone.  I'm fairly young.  Good luck.  All right, sir.  I'll take it.  Godspeed.  Yes.  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Thanks, Drew.  Hang in there, all right?  Later on, bro.  All right, bro.  Have you guys been watching the Olympics?  A little highlight here and there. 
[00:34:30]  But no, I was never a big Olympic watcher.  I wasn't either.  But there's something about these Olympics.  Everybody's watching.  The ratings are through the roof.  Really?  Yeah, Michael Phelps has got the attention of the entire country.  He ends up winning eight gold medals.  You didn't see any of those races, Ant?  No, just the highlights.  Oh, my God.  The highlights.  Amazing stuff.  Yeah, they were enjoying it.  I watched the swimming.  Isn't he the most winningest Olympian ever?  Was he winningest Olympian ever?  Yeah, now he is. 
[00:35:00]  Yep.  So I kind of watched for that.  He obviously beat Mark Spitz's record of seven gold medals.  He's got eight.  And he's got, what, 14 overall?  How many?  14 gold medals overall.  14 gold medals overall.  What?  16 totally.  Picked up a couple of them.  All right.  You can swim.  Jesus.  What's wrong with the guy?  We get it.  He lives in a pool house.  Fish.  And his father hasn't been part of his life, doesn't want anything to do with him.  They had a picture of him in the paper.  The father just kind of going into his condo somewhere.  Oh, really? 
[00:35:30]  Somewhere down there in Baltimore, I think.  Why?  He's got like, this guy.  His dad probably said, do you want to go out and toss around the ball?  And he's like, swimming.  He's in the pool all the time.  He's like, do you want to go fishing or something?  No.  No, I just want to be swimming.  I'm swimming.  That's got to be a little weird for the guy.  He's the father of pretty much the most famous person in the world right now.  Yeah.  One of the greatest athletes of all time.  They're starting to bait that.  And the father's like, yeah, I haven't talked to him in 15, 20 years. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, he's probably going to ring him up.  Huh?  Hi.  Hey.  How you been?  Hey.  Hey.  I've been thinking of calling you.  Yeah.  I figured I'd see how Athens and China went.  But that's got to be weird.  Because you know the guy's got his life.  He's probably got a job somewhere.  And the guy's around the office.  What do you do?  Well, do you think you just look the other way?  Like, huh?  Hey.  See the Olympics?  Oops.  Did the father leave, you think, years ago?  I don't know what it was. 
[00:36:30]  He was, uh, they split up when he was nine years old.  And then he didn't see his dad until he was in high school.  They tried to reunite.  And then it didn't happen.  The dad's a retired cop.  And he does still live in Baltimore.  So you know there's got to be a lot of family connection floating around.  Yeah.  This is what's going to happen to Michael Phelps.  After smashing records in the pool, Michael...  Why do we always have to have this guy?  After smashing records in the pool...  Why do we always have to have this guy?  Hey.  We got Americans over there covering this crap? 
[00:37:00]  It's kind of fun, actually.  He's swimming hotter than Wasabi.  After smashing records in the pool, Michael Phelps is now on his way to a record payday, set to become the highest-earning Olympian in history.  Outside of the pool, in the pool, on the medal podium, there are tons of memories that I'll have from this.  And, you know, every single one I'll remember for the rest of my life.  Even before winning a record eight gold medals, he collected a million-dollar bonus from one of his sponsors, Speedo. 
[00:37:30]  Congratulations, Michael.  And that's on top of the $5 million a year he was already earning from endorsements from companies like Visa.  In Athens, Michael came out of the Athens games as an American sports hero.  You know, he's coming out of these games as a global sports icon.  Visa declined to say how much it pays Phelps, but whatever the amount, sports agents say expect it to go up a lot.  Perhaps in the same league as David Beckham and Tiger Woods. 
[00:38:00]  The bottom line is, is he at the $87 million endorsement number of Tiger?  Probably not.  He may be at $30, $40, $50 million a year in endorsements after this is all said and done.  But there could be a catch doing too much too soon, whilst no one has diluting the brand.  And the Olympics are just two weeks every four years.  Unlike other pro athletes who compete during regular seasons, Phelps won't be seen like this again until he dives into a pool in London in 2012.  Oh, he's going to do another Olympics. 
[00:38:30]  How old is he?  Wow, he's 23, I think.  Wait, he competed when he was 17?  No.  Athens was 19.  I'm sorry, I applaud 19.  Yeah, and he's going to do one more.  God, 23 years old.  Oh, he might have two more Olympics in him.  Yeah, he'll probably do one more.  Yeah.  Probably do one more and say, you know what, I'm done with this.  Now I've got to start liking girls finally.  They're going out.  Oh, man, you read up on these guys.  They don't have any lives. 
[00:39:00]  You hear about the Chinese gymnasts that are like 13, 12?  Oh, that's crazy.  They're crazy over there with that whole thing.  And they're claiming that these girls are 16 and they're not 16, and they interviewed  one of these girls, and she's like, I haven't seen my family in over a year.  They just put me in some kind of gym camp.  They just take them away.  It's like the old Soviet Union used to do.  They used to do the same thing with their kids.  Holy crap.  They just take them from their parents.  You look good.  Yeah.  You're small.  Very good.  They were asking this little girl these questions, and she's like, I haven't had a holiday in 
[00:39:30]  over a year.  They call it a holiday.  I haven't seen my parents in over a year.  Giving shots to keep their breasts from growing.  Yeah.  Do they?  Yeah.  Rumor has it.  Well, yeah, because you can't be a gymnast with big boobies.  Big boobies.  It gets in the way of everything.  Big giant cans on a gymnast.  Who wouldn't want to see that?  It's a 20-year-old flipping backwards in her 34 Cs, jiggling obscenely.  Just going, woo, woo, woo.  It never seems to work when you get an Olympics, and the girl is, I don't know, 14 or whatever, 
[00:40:00]  and then the next Olympics, she's 18 and has developed but doesn't want to realize it's  over, Johnny.  Yeah.  And then they're doing the mat routine, and it just looks like a rug act at the strip club.  It looks like they put the slow song on at the strip club.  Oh, that's funny, man.  Nice white lycra outfit.  Yeah.  Oh, talk about a camel toe.  Just complete camel toe. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah, right.  It goes actually up to the breastbone.  Wow.  You guys hear about Ugly Chinese Girl at the opening ceremonies?  Oh.  And her name?  Huh?  These guys, you don't watch TV?  I didn't hear about Ugly Chinese Girl.  You don't read papers.  I'm sure I've handed all my cash a few times.  Ugly Chinese Girl.  Yeah.  You had this beautiful little Chinese girl singing at the opening ceremonies, and then 
[00:41:00]  it turns out that she was lip syncing for the ugly Chinese girl that actually sang the  song.  Really?  They did a little switcheroo.  Everything is...  A little...  Milli Vanilli.  Thank you.  Yes.  Such a huge...  Yeah, but...  And then they showed the girl who actually sang the song and the one they replaced her  with.  Oh, wow.  Really?  There's the ugly one.  Well, the Chinese thought she was ugly.  You know, the Chinese government over there in China, very deceptive. 
[00:41:30]  Awful.  God, they're just all very cloak and dagger.  Very secretive.  I hear there's people over there at the airport, and they won't leave until the Chinese government  gives their Bibles back.  They brought, like, Bibles with them, and they were confiscated at customs there in China.  Sure.  They don't want any information from the West getting over there.  I don't care what it is.  You're talking about a book that's a couple thousand years old, you know?  Wait, people are staying for their Bibles? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know they're buddinskis.  I know.  Just leave.  But is that ugly...  No, that's hot.  That's hot.  Oh.  Yeah, that was the one they replaced her with.  I can't tell.  What's the difference between two little kids?  Who cares?  Well, they've been doing a bunch of trickery over there in China for the airport.  Trickery.  Their fireworks display was digitally enhanced.  Was it?  Oh, they're doing all sorts of things.  Oh, yeah.  What is with them?  Come on.  What was it?  The footprints in the sky that was, like, digitally enhanced or something? 
[00:42:30]  They CGI'd in the fireworks as they came back from break with those giant sweep-in camera  overhead shots, like a plane coming over Beijing, and you saw these huge fireworks displays  that were all perfectly timed with the music.  Well, guess what?  They were all CGI'd.  Yeah.  Who told on them?  Man.  Someone leaked it, and then they confirmed everything.  Like this little girl.  Someone leaked it, and they squeezed them, and they just gave it up right away.  Yeah, we needed someone who had perfect face, they said. 
[00:43:00]  They're doing a great job, though.  Perfect face.  Perfect face.  I'm watching every night.  I don't know what it is about this Olympics, but it's...  Did you see the gymnastics thing the night that we didn't win, but we took, like, silver  and gold, or silver and bronze, and Bella Caroli was going nuts, because they had Bella  Caroli next to Bob Costas watching the routines, and Caroli's, like, 6'8", and he's screaming,  yes, come on, yes, of course, good, good girl, good girl, and Costas is shrinking away,  trying to get away from him. 
[00:43:30]  Head arrest.  Well, let's start with, yeah, I think so.  He looks like a kid toucher.  Yeah, that looks great.  He looks like a kid toucher.  They should look into him a little bit.  And Bob Costas, what is he doing with the freaking dye job?  Oh, is he?  Oh, my God.  He has jet black hair.  It's very, very creepy to look at.  And then you look at Jim Lampley, who's as gray as anyone's grandfather.  And Lampley is a weirdo.  He is a weirdo, that guy.  All right, we'll talk about the Olympics a little more.  We've got to talk about the weightlifting guy who popped his elbow. 
[00:44:00]  Have you seen this yet?  Oh, I've heard about it.  Oh, holy yes.  Could be the greatest Olympic moment ever.  Popped his elbow.  Got to talk about the Jamaican who won the 100-meter dash with his shoe untied  and was celebrating.  We'll get into that after the break.  He broke a world record, but he could have smashed the world record.  But he was celebrating as he was still running, which was insane.  Why did he stop to tie his shoe? 
[00:44:30]  We also have to do a quick break on the stupidest Olympic sports.  Is it doubles ping pong, or is it that dodgeball slash soccer thing they do?  Yeah, team handball.  Team handball.  I don't know.  And we'll take more of your phone calls.  877-212-ON-A.  A big good morning to everybody, Opie and Anthony, little Jimmy Norton.  If you're just tuning in, you're missing all the fun. 
[00:45:00]  We're recapping Anthony's huge pool party he had, what, Saturday night?  Yes.  Are you going to have another pool party, people are asking?  I'm having, I'll be having parties, but 10, 12 people the most.  We had about 110 people there, and wow, just too much to handle.  That party didn't seem like it was you.  You're not that type of guy.  No, it's kind of hard to be like, you know, the host of a party. 
[00:45:30]  I like going to parties.  I don't like throwing the parties.  It's just too much to do, and I don't know.  I wanted to see you in a tux with a martini, your head split, going,  a great party, isn't it?  Great party.  I hope stares to the guy in the piggy suit, the bunny suit, the piggy mask on.  I was really bummed I had to leave early.  I had stuff to do in Philly, but before I went, you know, 
[00:46:00]  you were giving house tours.  Oh, yes, yes.  That turned into a tour of your gun closet.  Yes.  And a tour of basically your guns in general.  Yes.  No one cared about the rest of this beautiful house of yours when they got to the gun closet  and, well, let's just say your guns in general.  Well, my, yeah.  And I noticed a good old James Ford, smug guy on Channel 11 here in New York City, 
[00:46:30]  right after he took the gun tour, I saw him pretty much fleeing your house.  What was that about?  I don't know.  He didn't want to be part of that?  I don't know where he went.  Because I saw Jill go, hey, James, where are you going?  He's like, I got to get something in my car.  And I think that was it for him.  I think he left.  I don't know.  Was he frightened of all of my artillery?  I think you chased him away.  He's like, this is insane.  I can't be in this house.  I don't know what happened. 
[00:47:00]  I'm trying to be a legitimate reporter here.  They're all legal.  Everything's legal.  I know.  Everything's legal.  Yeah.  It's just disturbing how many you got.  Well, they're all fun.  I think that's what disturbs people.  You know, gun rhymes with fun.  Yeah.  It's not a coincidence.  They're very fun to shoot.  I liked when you were just kind of throwing handguns out onto your bed.  Oh, and this one, and this one, and this one.  And this one.  Well, I was just tossing them around on the bed.  I wanted to, you know, display them. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  I took a little picture.  And that was early on.  I could only imagine what was going on after I left.  Oh, no.  I put them all away.  I wasn't even, you know, I figured I didn't need to be armed at my own party.  Oh, that was nice of you.  Yeah.  I figured I'd throw everyone a bone and not be armed.  I'm sure your guests appreciate it.  You know, you never know when it's going to get out of hand.  It's not one of these block parties in Bed-Stuy or something.  East New York parties.  Yeah.  Oh, boy. 
[00:48:00]  Air show.  You know, when they show, like, air show footage on TV, that just means one thing.  Another air show disaster.  You don't want to be the pilot that is in print in the paper where it says,  horrified spectators looked on as.  Yeah.  You don't want to be the guy they're talking about.  Yeah, it's, uh, they never just show, uh, pretty loop-to-loops on TV.  No.  Hey, we got some cute air show footage.  It's always some horrific thing going on where they're just missing the bleachers, 
[00:48:30]  a fireball just missing the bleachers.  You always get the, uh, the guy's video from the stands, and then you hear, like,  oh, no, oh, oh, no.  That's why you came there, dummy.  Let's say hi to Rob.  All the way.  Uh, yes there, Jimmy.  It's bad, very bad news for us.  What happened?  Musharraf, Pakistan's president, resigned.  Oh.  And that's a bad thing for the U.S.  That's a bad thing for us.  He resigned?  Why did he resign? 
[00:49:00]  I don't know.  Uh, well, hopefully they'll get some fanatical leader in there that will hate us.  The whole country hates us.  I think they have nukes, and, uh, he was, I believe, a military dictator, and he was our  guy.  Mm.  So, of course, his own people hated him, but the fact that he's gone is bad news for  the U.S.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Rob and Brang.  Keep an eye on that.  How do you say Beijing?  I don't think you say Beijing.  Everyone says Beijing, but I think it's more bear.  I could still call it Peking.  Is it the old Peking?  They're going back and forth, because half the NBC announcers are saying Beijing, and 
[00:49:30]  some are saying Beijing.  And I think the correct is Beijing.  Yeah.  But why would they, no American who doesn't speak Chinese would say it with that accent?  Why don't they just say it like everyone else who doesn't live there says it?  Yeah.  I call it f***y land.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  No.  No one says Beijing.  No.  No.  It sounds like you're mispronouncing it. 
[00:50:00]  It's Beijing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rob, you're in Beijing.  Yeah, guys.  Hey, you know, we're listening to this show this morning, and can you guys cool it with  the bashing China?  Because we would all like to leave here alive.  Oh.  A little tense being there as an American.  A little tense the first day.  Two people got stabbed.  dude it wasn't it wasn't bad at first but i've been out here now for about a month  yeah and you start to see under the mask after a while you know they're all very nice on the surface 
[00:50:30]  but uh yeah after a while you get to see under the mask yeah i have my my beach volleyball cam  up in the pal soccer room for you and oh do you yeah wait you're watching beach volleyball right  now well there's no there's no action going on right now but i have the net cam up so you can  see the net you know when we actually start playing again in about an hour hey when is the uh olympics  over um i think it's saturday i we're done here thursday i believe i think we do our final medal  round on thursday so are you competing in the olympics no i'm here with uh i'm covering it 
[00:51:00]  okay for what for nbc oh okay very cool i'm i'm the one that built your studio for you guys at xm yes  oh really yes lucky man gets to go all over the place all right rob thank you so much tilt all  right good luck man oh yeah beach volleyball net cam yeah here we go there's no one there yeah  quite exciting you should have the heinie cam not that no no no you all know you're gonna find a 
[00:51:30]  tiny cam there yeah why would you not there oh yeah silly i'm with you all right hey uh we got  the hungarian weightlifter uh audio i can't believe you guys in this thing yeah we were watching the  clip uh during a little commercial break wow let's get the video up for uh everybody on ondayradio.com  that is so nasty to watch this is how it went down now yanos baronyai from hungary 
[00:52:00]  i'm hungry if this doesn't if this announcer doesn't go holy ass and start screaming then he's not human  last lift for his snatch discipline he's been very consistent one smash discipline now 148 on the bar  oh that's tear on no that's terrible 
[00:52:30]  for the people that don't know out there but he just described so casually 
[00:53:00]  ah nice terrible elbow bending in a way an elbow shouldn't be bending never and then the whole  arm snapping back and pretty much knocking the guy out his body was shaking and twitching you remember  that um remember that uh clip in fast times at ridgemont high when uh what's his name the  football player there yeah farce whitaker hits the uh the quarterback and he's just twitching on the 
[00:53:30]  ground yeah that's what this guy does yeah he's laying there shaking and twitching because i guess  his brain was so consumed with pain at that moment oh scream is really it's amazing how you don't try  to keep your cool when you've snapped your elbow with heavyweights like certain things just make  all appearances go out the window yes and that's one of them snapped he didn't care that he was on  television in front of the whole world it was just agony and then the chinese uh i guess part of the 
[00:54:00]  olympic uh i don't say committee part of the group they run out and they all have these signs in  front of them that has beijing olympics on them and they cover up the area yeah nothing to see here  yeah they just kind of kind of like their uh what what were you guys saying kind of like what they  do with their internet and everything else yeah and all the country's nothing to see here right  all the country's problems they're hungry yeah yeah everything they just kind of cover it up with  so so this guy this guy's elbow uh popped out of socket there you go and then snap back and i think 
[00:54:30]  it hit him in the head right his own arm it's an insane sport this weightlifting because it's not  like every other sport in in the olympics uh you're trying to beat the record from the last guy right  and you see him they're doing it running you know they they top the last guy weightlifting you just  got to keep putting on more weight and you have to reach a point where the body just can't take it  anymore i'm surprised this isn't happening more often you're right because all these guys are at the  olympics to set world records they're almost disappointed if they win the gold and not set a new world record 
[00:55:00]  here uh we backed up the tape so the the announcers they're just terrific  oh no that's terrible oh he's dislocated that's just awful now they come and well that is absolutely  tragic and and thank goodness the loaders have come up and blocked that from view and 
[00:55:30]  this young man from hungary will be in the absolute world of pain dislocating his left elbow and gosh  why do we have to see this we don't want to see it again no oh no oh that's terrible oh stop showing  this for goodness sake yeah we don't need to see this anymore thank you well the pain of it all we can  we don't want to see but here he is a very brave lip from the hungarian he looked as though he had it  at one stage and it also clipped his back on the way down what a bunch of fruits we should just 
[00:56:00]  march in and take their women yeah oh that's terrible oh i oh this is terrible terrible i'm sorry  i'm sorry that's terrible oh oh that's terrible oh that's terrible oh no that's terrible ah  no i oh no what language is that is that english i'm gonna go with australia ah no i i think they're

[00:58:30]  i think that's a career ender i think that's it for him oh that's terrible oh no that's terrible  yeah we need that for the replay immediately you know that's like that's like when you open your car  door too far yeah like open it and push it yeah like open your car door and push it and then try to  close it it won't work i know i know let's go to jared in boston jared singing today yeah 
[00:59:00]  you're right guys good to hear you uh let the tape roll for a little bit i can only imagine the guy  rolling in pain and kind of the shock of the moment has gone back and the commentators just go back to  nice cool comic collected yeah i like how he goes oh we don't i wish i could do the freaking accent but  it goes out we don't need to see this again yeah and they showed it five times yeah i again  oh that's terrible oh no that's terrible oh no it's terrible oh hi hi oh we got a we got a new 
[00:59:30]  clip for all all car crashes a bad phone call of course absolutely right it's like kiwi idiots  it's trying to retire this one yeah and go with this one  oh that's oh no that's terrible oh no that's terrible oh all right why would you lift that 
[01:00:00]  much weight put it down you don't need to oh they're gonna do it with practical stuff like  they're gonna put them on stairs and like have them like hoist a piano or something you'd need a  friend for that's couches dude that's what they do with the strongman competition you want to see  some silly stuff that's strongman competition oh and they gotta throw 55 gallon drums full of water  up into a two-story window throw like telephone poles over a wall yeah that is the funniest thing 
[01:00:30]  to watch just make those faces but that's practical strength you know sometimes you need a truck tire  thrown over a lake who doesn't actually need a friend to help you yeah hey uh we also have bella  going crazy watching the gymnastics uh yeah he used to be the trainer right wasn't he one of the  yeah he like uh who did you do mary lou wasn't he originally a soviet uh yeah we i think he was

[01:01:30]  here and that how much do you hate bob costas i he had his time man but ugh do you like bob costas  i i like him but i don't i don't i haven't watched him announce anything in a long time this is the  first time i'm hearing his voice in a year i just don't like the guy  that's it sometimes you can look at someone you just know you don't like him if you think this is 
[01:02:00]  something there's almost a sport within a sport here and that sport is watching bella  watch gymnastics this was as it happened live wow wow yes  you can't she's an olympic champion she'll be an olympic champion come on come on beautiful  beautiful beautiful beautiful yes yes yes yes she's an olympic champion i'm telling you i'm telling you 
[01:02:30]  i'm telling you wow wow wow wow wow wow what a douche what a big meaty hands he has  and we always emphasize here complete journalistic objectivity is the byword  what the best very nice very nice yeah that sounds like that yeah she won the great success  what is it it did have a kind of a borat sound to him now i'm making the sexy time 
[01:03:00]  uh bella oh but watch gymnastics this was very funny  wow wow  yes  You tell me, she's an Olympic champion.  She'll be an Olympic champion.  Come on, come on.  Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. 
[01:03:30]  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no, that's terrible.  What happened?  I'm telling you, I'm telling you.  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Great.  And as we always emphasize here, complete journalistic objectivity is the byword.  Wow, wow, wow.  Give me your tears, gypsy woman. 
[01:04:00]  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Olympic champion.  He is a creep.  Just a big ghoul.  How big is he?  He's kind of a stocky guy.  I don't know.  He's hanging out with four foot eight.  That walrus mustache, right?  Yeah, he's standing next to Costas.  He doesn't look, he's probably 6'2", 6'3".  He's a big guy.  Wow, wow, wow.  He sounds excited.  Wow, wow, wow. 
[01:04:30]  Let's go to Jessica in Connecticut.  Jessica.  Hey, ONA, I just wanted to call in about Bob Costas.  Tell I.  How do I say hello now?  I don't know.  I just wanted to call in and say that I think the reason why I can't stand him so much in  this Olympics is because they're just making him talk about the dumbest shit on earth.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow. 
[01:05:00]  She's the cursing champion, yes.  Boom, boom, boom.  All right, thank you.  A little potty mouth.  You're kind of right, though.  I mean, the Olympics, there's a lot of fluff.  A lot of stuff to talk about, a lot of downtime.  A lot of downtime.  It's like, okay, now we get to see this Usain Bolt run for 9.69 seconds.  The Jamaican sprinter who's just out of his mind.  6'4", 98 pounds.  He sets the world record with his shoelace untied. 
[01:05:30]  And he's celebrating with 20 meters to go.  The announcer's yelling and screaming, basically saying, what a dummy.  This guy could have done 9.59, which would be completely insane.  Yeah.  Because when they break the world record in the 100 meter, it's by one one-hundredth of a second.  What, did he start spinning around or something?  He just, he's looking to his right, he starts moving his arms, he's just rocking and rolling  and partying already.  It's crazy. 
[01:06:00]  What an idiot.  When that race is all about form and just, you know, going all out right to the end.  Let's say how to John in New York.  He does look like Omar.  John.  Hey, how you doing?  Good, John.  Hey, did you notice how the weight lifter sounded like Bob Kelly when he broke his knee?  Yeah.  It sounded like he was lifting Bob Kelly.  Rob in Jersey.  What's up, Rob? 
[01:06:30]  Hey, guys.  Hey.  The second announcer said, excellent world of pain.  What is so excellent about pain?  He said an excellent world of pain, really?  Is that the...  Rewind the tape and listen to it carefully.  His co-announcer said, this man's going to be in an excellent world of pain.  Yeah, there's nothing excellent about that, right?  Yeah, let's hear the full clip again as we go to break.  Thank you, Rob.  No problem.  And the video's up on onaradio.com.  Where's Jim McKay this Olympics?  Oh, he's dead.  Oh. 
[01:07:00]  He's dead.  Oh.  Did he?  Now, Janos Baranjai from Hungary.  Last lift for his stash discipline.  He's been very consistent.  140, then 145, now 148 on the bar.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[01:07:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, no, that's terrible.  Oh, he's dislocated.  That's just awful.  Down they come in.  Well, that is absolutely tragic.  And thank goodness the loaders have come up and blocked that from view.  And this young man from Hungary will be in an absolute world of pain. 
[01:08:00]  He's dislocating his left elbow, and gosh, why do we have to see this?  Oh, no, we don't want to see it again.  No.  Again.  No.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, stop showing this for goodness sake.  Yeah, we don't need to see this anymore.  Thank you.  Ah.  Well, two girls, one cup.  Yeah.  Know what that means, by the way?  Keep showing it.  Keep showing it.  Yeah.  Keep shying it.  We don't need to.  Yes, you do.  I know.  We don't need to see this anymore.  Thank you. 
[01:08:30]  Ah.  Well, the pain of it all, we don't want to see.  But here he is, a very brave lift from the Hungary.  He looked as though he had it at one stage, and it also clipped his back on the way down.  Yeah, well, there you go.  All right, we've got to take a break.  When we get back, we've got another message from Jimmy.  The post-surgery message you left for everybody.  Oh, I forgot I even left that one.  I've got to hear that.  And, well, the Yankees are out of it, but you've got John Sterling really.  Are they out of it?  Pretty much.  Good.  Pretty much.  You get stupid asses.  How many big...  Pretty much, Jimmy. 
[01:09:00]  Johnny Damon.  Damonic.  Well, he's got a grand slam call.  That's pretty terrific, considering the Yankees are not making the playoffs this year.  They're not even making the playoffs?  They're what, six games out of the wild card, even, or something like that?  A-Rod is a bum.  You are a bum.  What a bum.  The applicant is a bum.  They just got Pudge Rodriguez.  Great big free agent signings.  You stink. 
[01:09:30]  Good.  Beat it.  Out of the playoffs.  Adios.  Here's your hat.  What's your hurry?  Go home, sissies.  Also on the way, a great clip from Ernest Borgnine.  Ernest Borgnine?  McHale.  He's 91 years...  91?  I'm sure he's saying something relevant and smart.  You haven't heard this clip yet?  No, I haven't.  Oh, stick around.  It's going to give you the secret to his long life, my friend. 
[01:10:00]  Ah!  It's going to be a scream.  Opie and Anthony.  Moving right along with the Opie and Anthony show.  First date back from the big vacation.  I had a staycation, I call it.  That's where you don't go anywhere.  Yeah, we all did, actually.  A staycation.  Oh.  Stayed close to home.  I had a gaycation.  A gaycation, yes.  It's wonderful.  Yes.  That's where you bite a pillow in any hotel in the country. 
[01:10:30]  Why?  You guys read the stupid post today?  Hmm.  Yes.  With that actor.  Oh, in the little blind item.  Well...  It's called a blind item.  They give you a little info, and you're supposed to figure it out yourself, so they don't get  sued, apparently.  Yeah, but it's page six in Richard Johnson, who, they don't really feel like checking their  facts, so, you know. 
[01:11:00]  But this is what they're writing today.  What are they writing today, Anthony, in the Just Asking column?  Well, did they get this one right, Richard?  Oh, oh, oh.  I don't know if, where the hell is it?  Here, here.  You got it?  I love this one.  It's so sexy.  Uh, boy, I'm sure this guy doesn't want this coming out.  Which hunk in a summer movie, so it's a hunk, a guy considered a hunk, in a movie that's 
[01:11:30]  out this summer, is a violent, closeted, homosexual.  Wow.  The heartthrob snuck into his ex's apartment a few months ago and raped him so violently  the ex ended up in the hospital.  And the actor paid him $500,000 to keep his, uh, yap shut.  Funny, after making him open it. 
[01:12:00]  Put him in the hospital.  That's how you executive produce.  All right, so it's a summer movie.  Summer movie hunk.  What are some summer movies?  Well, it's not.  Tropic Thunder.  It's not, it's not an action film, obviously, where they would have said action hero.  Yeah.  Which hunk is in a summer movie?  We got, uh, Robert Downey.  Matthew McConaughey's a hunk.  Robert Downey Jr.  Robert Downey Jr.  Got Matthew McConaughey.  McConaughey.  He's been known to do some wacky things.  The hunk. 
[01:12:30]  And he's, uh, he was naked once playing the bongos.  Playing the bongos.  Guy was over the house.  And then you got that other guy from the journey to the center of the day.  Got a girl in the car.  What was the journey movie?  A journey to the center of the earth and the mummy there.  Brendan Fraser.  Brendan Fraser.  And then you got Will Smith, but that's more of an action hero.  Yeah, he's not gay.  So.  No.  Nah.  But, uh, I wonder if it's, uh.  I would say my opinion, just based on what I've, uh, heard in the past, um, I'd say Matthew 
[01:13:00]  McConaughey.  That would be my fantasy.  Hmm.  Is that it would be him.  Like, just crazed and all violent.  Yeah, and then he'd talk to me in that stupid southern accent he uses.  Creep.  I can't think of anyone else who it would be.  Is the Hulk a summer movie?  I don't think Robert Downey Jr. is considered a hunk heartthrob.  That's why people are saying that, but, um, I don't know.  No, he's not.  It would have said drug addicted, or it would have said something about his drug problems. 
[01:13:30]  Bad boy.  Would have been what Hollywood bad boy.  Hmm.  Um, is it, uh.  How do you send him to the hospital after?  You just know what it is.  Excuse me.  Yeah, of course you do.  Yes, I, I washed this white sock with my red shirt.  Came out pink.  Yeah.  God was sleeping like gump after he got shot.  How awful is that?  Oh.  You gotta fork over a half a million, because you did a good job. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  That's probably the best half a million you ever spent.  Yeah.  Who wouldn't want to put their ex in the hospital with a good, with a good rogering?  Jimmy, I got something for you today.  Swung on and driven at deep right center.  Hit is high.  Hit is far.  And it's gone.  Oh, he thought right field, all right.  He drilled it out in the right center field bleachers.  The Giambino.  It's a grand slam. 
[01:14:30]  The Giambi grand slams in the right center field seats.  And the Yankees take a 10-3 lead.  And the Yankees are still nine games behind Tampa Bay.  The Giambino.  And five games behind the Boston Red Sox.  The Yankees are behind Tampa Bay.  By nine games.  By nine games.  And he's calling home runs like that.  Shut up.  You asses.  Ugh.  And I keep wasting some, uh, keep wasting big free agent money. 
[01:15:00]  Mm-hmm.  A-Rod.  Just a bum.  Useless.  Worthless.  Worthless.  Good.  I hope they never win again.  Bunch of creeps.  Well, that would be almost impossible, Jimmy.  I know.  They play a lot of games.  No, I'm in a championship.  They'll probably.  Not a game.  In a game.  They might just win one or two, you know.  I'm in a championship.  Oh, okay.  Great dynasty.  Right into the toilet.  That's you being rude, stupid. 
[01:15:30]  What sport is it possible where you never win another game?  You never win another game.  Baseball, I would.  It's safe to say that you're going to win a few.  That's a tough one.  That's a tough one, right.  A lot of games.  A lot of games.  Yeah, even football, you're going to win one.  Yeah.  Speaking of football, I think I'm on the Brett Favre train there.  Brett Favre?  Favre.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm starting to get excited about football.  I'm starting to get excited about the Jets.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think so.  You think he's going to be all that, as they say? 
[01:16:00]  I was like, ugh, when I heard that the Jets did this.  But now I'm thinking, yeah, this is a good move for the Jets.  It's bringing a lot of excitement to Jersey.  Jet fans do seem to be pretty happy with the situation.  And what I love about it is that no one's talking about the Giants.  Who won the Super Bowl?  It's like, ah, whatever, that other team.  It's all about the Jets and Brett Favre.  That was the last year.  Brett Favre.  Brett Favre.  And in his first game with the Jets, what, a little 5 for 6, 48 yards and a TD pass. 
[01:16:30]  He did one series and did very well.  Are you a football fan, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah.  Well, the Cowboys, right?  But I still want to see.  America's team.  Yeah, but I don't follow even football as close.  I don't follow any sports as closely as I used to.  No, huh?  Nah, because most jocks I just don't like.  Most of the ones I've met, not all of them, a lot of them are just big, dumb douches.  Well, they're jocks.  Exactly.  Yeah, that's what they do. 
[01:17:00]  They always try to be funny, and they never are.  Do what you do.  How about this?  You inject steroids and hopefully hurt yourself, and I'll be the funny worm.  Why don't we compromise on that?  Look at this guy.  Good one.  Stupid.  All right.  We got your post-surgery message, too.  This is a new thing Jimmy's doing.  He leaves little messages for his fans.  Yeah, the number's 917-267-2602.  I make no money from this, so I don't think this is some way we're going to screw you for money. 
[01:17:30]  It's free.  Why are you doing this?  I like doing it, man.  It's fun to update, and I can listen to fan messages.  They're all on my MySpace page.  All fan messages are public, and all my messages are public.  So why don't we play some of these?  Some of the better ones.  Patty left me one.  I downloaded it.  The phone number's up on ondayradio.com if you want to listen to what Jimmy's saying.  But this is the message he left after his nose job.  I have not heard this.  How's your nostrils?  Are they back to normal?  Look up. 
[01:18:00]  Here's the left one.  Look up.  Air is coming through a little bit, but the left one will...  It'll take weeks before I can really breathe.  I still can't breathe when I lay down.  It'll be a while.  I'm still shooting a little saline up my nose to keep it...  Ooh!  Simply saline.  But I put my finger on my nose, and I can feel like stitches.  Maybe you shouldn't put your finger in your nose.  It's hard not to when you want to...  I want to scrape the blood boogers out.  No!  Shut up!  I'm trying to tell you something.  They're like little corn flakes.  Oh, God.  That's the difference between you and I, because if I had that surgery, I'd still be bleeding, 
[01:18:30]  because I wouldn't be able to keep my fingers out of my nose.  You have to stop, though, because it hurts.  It's like, I got a couple out, but...  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just the stitches are in there.  Oh!  All right, let's go to Mike in Connecticut.  Mike!  Guys, what's going on, man?  What's up, Mike?  Jimmy, I love you, man.  Thank you.  I just want to say, Oop, can you please shut up and stop jinxing the Jets, man?  Oh!  Oh, God, he did just come out and say that he likes the whole thing with the Jets and  Brett Favre, and it was honest, and... 
[01:19:00]  Stop, please!  I'm a die of our Jets, man, Oop.  We can't have you saying stuff on the radio, man.  You're excited or what?  I'm very pumped.  I was at the game Saturday.  I gave him a big standing ovation with that touchdown and everything, you know?  Even though preseason football sucks, like you guys mentioned, but, you know, it was  nice to see Favre and good to see some positive energy in the stadium.  But, you know, this is one of those situations that happens from time to time.  You know, Brett Favre is going to play for the Jets for a couple of years, and then he's  going to go back and go in the Hall of Fame as a Packer, and everyone's going to pretty 
[01:19:30]  much forget that he ever played for the Jets.  That's true, but, you know...  Unless he wins the Super Bowl.  That's the only way he gets out of this, by the way.  That's true.  You're right.  You're right.  But it's better than what we had.  You know, we had Pennington who couldn't throw past 10 yards, so...  Yeah.  We're good.  All right, man.  Well, Chad did all right for the Dolphins, though.  For a couple of years, he's going to go back.  All right, well...  He's going to listen to himself.  All right.  End of conversation.  Here's Jimmy post-surgery and what he left for everybody.  Hey, it's Jim. 
[01:20:00]  I just got home from surgery.  It's about 7 o'clock at night.  And, uh, this hurts.  It really is painful.  So, uh, I'm not bleeding as much as I thought I would.  But, uh, I feel a little queasy.  I puked a little bit before.  Can I just say something?  That is...  Yeah.  ...the perfect calling-in-sick voice.  That is the voice I used to strive for whenever I would call up Apollo Air Conditioning or any 
[01:20:30]  of my other jobs.  That is the ultimate voice that I was trying for when I'd be like, I can't make it in.  I'm so sick.  I really don't feel...  You got it down.  That's like real agony.  Yeah, I couldn't...  I was in pain, but I just...  It's so hard to talk because my lips were so swollen.  And, um, I had taken a Percocet at the hospital.  Ooh.  I was in real pain.  Uh, I mean, it was hurting.  So, it was, uh, you know, it was groggy. 
[01:21:00]  I understand.  It was groggy.  I'm like hearing it.  I backed it up.  I want to try something here.  Hey, it's Jim.  Uh, I just got home, um, from surgery.  It's about 7 o'clock at night.  And, uh, I mean, it hurts.  It really is painful.  Yeah!  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's terrible.  Oh, my God.  That's terrible.  I got to work on it.  I need just that one, the one part of that clip. 
[01:21:30]  It's terrible.  Yeah, that's terrible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, let's listen to Jimmy without interrupting.  Uh, I just got home, um, from surgery.  It's about 7 o'clock at night.  And, uh, it hurts.  It really is painful.  Uh, I'm not bleeding as much as I thought I would.  But, uh, I feel a little queasy.  I puked a little bit before, because I think I swallowed some blood during the surgery.  Uh, my lips just swollen.  I look like an idiot. 
[01:22:00]  So I don't even know what I can eat tonight.  And, uh, my stupid doctor prescribed Tylenol's codeine, which is not strong enough.  So I need something stronger, because, uh, my teeth and my gum, as I can feel it in.  It's like a hole inside my mouth hurts.  My nose does, too.  But I'm surprised I'm not bleeding a little bit more.  I mean, I'm not complaining.  I'm happy.  I guess this is what it's like to get a call from me when I'm f***ed up. 
[01:22:30]  I'm glad I don't drink or drug anymore.  I feel like this all the time.  Stop!  All right, uh, I'm okay.  I just feel kind of crappy and a little sick.  I don't want to eat something, but I'm afraid I'll throw it up.  I can't even get f***ed right now, because f***ing makes my head kind of like, you know,  like that intense blood rush.  Oh.  I have a gauze on my nose and I feel f***ed.  It's actually a pet. 
[01:23:00]  I feel like a s***.  It's very dry.  I'm glad I talked to you later.  You were talking about the fact you couldn't have sex, right?  I couldn't, uh, well, I was thinking of, uh...  Something else?  No, sex, but not with anyone else.  Right, right, right.  Sure.  I was bummed I couldn't even, you know, just enjoy myself.  Couldn't do that.  That was like a conversation where you pull up the chair bedside at the hospital and have  to listen to that.  I know!  Like, that was what that conversation was.  Really?  Oh.  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.  Oh, God.  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  But you look good.  You look good.  When the visiting hour's over?  You look good.  Yeah, no kidding.  I was...  Who hasn't been in that situation?  Holy crap.  45 minutes to go?  I was definitely, uh...  A little pilled out at that point.  Yeah, you were a little groggy.  A little groggy.  Aw, poor Jimmy.  A little bit, a little bit.  What a boob.  Poor Jimmy.  Ugh, yammering.  And I don't feel...  I puked a little bit.  Yeah.  Nurse, could you get the nurse for me?  I didn't get my Jell-O. 
[01:24:00]  That was what made me do an applesauce.  Oh.  Vomited blood in applesauce.  Mm, nice.  Yeah, look at that nice brain medley in the little...  A little brain medley.  It was like George Harrison's Q-tips.  No, that's how they knew when he sneezed, when you'd see that on the left and right wall  at the same time.  Well, someone called me maid. 
[01:24:30]  Well, either someone threw blood pudding into the fan, or...  Old George's got a little pepper in his nose.  Oh, my God.  Why?  A little pet tender.  Poor guy.  Yeah, always.  Speaking of which, well, Beatles, Mark David Chapman, he's going to stay in jail.  Good.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they did another one of those parole hearings.  What are they doing, man?  Five or six years, something like that?  They denied him parole.  Oh, good.  And Noko's like, look, you're not safe out there in the real world. 
[01:25:00]  People hate you.  That's basically what she was saying.  People hate you, and you're safer in jail.  Well, apparently, the guy that shot Reagan there has been given all kinds of freedoms.  Yeah, he's walking around more and more these days.  Let that guy visit anyone he wants, his family.  And they say it's unsupervised visits, but you know there's like black choppers and stuff.  Just Secret Service guys watching them.  I'm sure they implanted some kind of GPS device in him when he was sleeping.  Oh, they're claiming that he's unsupervised when he gets to go see his parents or something? 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, they say he's like, he's better.  Yeah.  He's all better now.  Yeah.  How about this?  Too bad.  How about this?  When you decide to shoot the president, you never get out of jail.  How about that?  Yeah.  I don't care if you're better.  Too bad.  That should just be a rule.  It should be mandatory.  We should start making our own rules.  Poor stupid James Brady with the divot in his head.  This guy's got to walk around like that.  Does he walk?  No, I don't think so.  Okay.  Well, he's got to, whatever.  He probably tries to walk every once in a while. 
[01:26:00]  Let's see how to...  I'm sure he doesn't like the fact that he's just walking around.  It's awful.  Let's go to Brian.  Brian.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Jimmy, I just want to let you know I really loved you at the end of Brian's song.  The way Ricky Outstayers was talking to you, you really stole it.  I loved it.  Ah, that's good.  Thanks.  Yeah.  Instead of Brian Piccolo, it was Jim Dilladone.  Randy's got the call of the day right here, though.  Randy, Massachusetts, listening on BCN. 
[01:26:30]  What's up, Randy?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you sure Jim's not the ex-boyfriend that got raped and sent to the hospital?  Oh, is that it?  Yes.  He came in very late at night.  He's hurting very much.  Nice.  More of your phone calls in just a bit.  877-212-01A.  When we get back, a fine clip from Ernest Borgnine.  The great Ernest Borgnine.  Is he talking about Escape from New York?  What movies was it?  He was in that.  Sure.  What else was he in? 
[01:27:00]  Was he in Kelly Zero?  No, he wasn't Kelly Zero.  No, he was in McHale's Navy.  Oh, McHale's Navy.  Sure.  That was his big thing that he was in.  Ah, Poseidon Adventure.  He was in Poseidon Adventure.  With the fat Shelly Winters.  No, he played the cop that was with the blonde.  No, I know.  The young, like.  Yeah, yeah.  The young thing.  He was the cop.  She was the prostitute.  And they were hooking up.  Hey, you're Snake Plissken.  Wow.  Not a bad Ernest Borgnine.  That's all I only do that one about.  No one does Ernest Borgnine. 
[01:27:30]  There's a reason for it.  No one cares about him.  Well, he's 91.  He looks like he's in his early sevens.  Oh, Airwolf, too.  Of course.  Airwolf.  Okay.  Was he in the Magnificent Seven?  Uh, yeah.  He won an Oscar in Marty.  He played a dumb Marty movie.  Way back when.  Was Marty retarded?  No.  No, but if it was, he obviously wouldn't have gone full retard.  Full retard.  I saw that FN movie the other night.  Again.  I saw it.  With the Philly crew.  You saw Tropical Thunder?  I liked it, yeah.  Tropical Thunder, I mean?  I don't like Jack Black in movies that much.  I don't think. 
[01:28:00]  He was pretty effing good.  I gotta give it to him, man.  A couple of funny lines, but I did like the movie.  How great was Robert Downey Jr.  He should be nominated.  For 400 years.  He was great.  He was great.  You like Simple Jack?  Hilarious.  Yes.  Hilarious.  Simple Jack was very funny.  And what about Tom Cruise?  He was great.  I mean.  Amazing, right?  Yeah, he really was interesting.  I mean, I just enjoyed watching him.  There was a couple of profile shots of Cruise, and he just looked disgusting.  And you know, he really was attacking the studio heads nicely. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, he plays a Jewish studio head.  Yeah, Les Grossman.  Right.  And when he pulled out his gold medallion and started doing the rap dance, holy ass.  Yeah, but the studio heads probably do use, like, rap lingo.  Like, they're gangsters.  Just these nerds.  Yeah.  Yeah, he really had them pegged.  The movie was fun, though, man.  Yeah, I enjoyed it.  There was a lot of stuff going on in that thing.  I still like something about Mary better, to be honest with you.  Really?  Yeah, it's one of my favorite comedies of all time.  But I did like this.  It was very funny.  Right on.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:29:00]  Show's flying by today.  Yes.  Big booyah to everybody today.  Booyah.  They point out how stupid NBC is, like every other network.  In the bottom left-hand corner, they have, like every other pukey network, their little logo.  They have to have 80% of the screen taken up by garbage and stock tickers, which no one reads.  But they're showing a photo finish between the two swimmers.  And, of course, you can't see the final results because these dummies leave their little logo on. 
[01:29:30]  And so you can't, it's obscured, the bottom swimmer.  I don't know.  It's so stupid.  Who is watching the videotape that they know they're going to use as a highlight thing and not taking into consideration that it is going to be totally obscured?  The focal point of the clip itself is going to be completely obscured by the station's graphic, which has had to have gotten so big now that, yeah, it cuts the screen in a third. 
[01:30:00]  It used to be very subtle.  It used to be like kind of a...  Maybe transparent a little bit in the corner.  Water market.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It just, now it...  Like, you would think if you're looking at the clip, you would go, all right, there's going to be a problem.  We're not going to be able to see this part of the clip, like the photo finish.  But they don't, uh, they don't seem to care.  They've allowed their graphics departments to go...  Like, right now, the NBC one, the peacock wings are falling off and it's morphing into a Today Show sign. 
[01:30:30]  And it's this Decision 2008 narrowing the VP choices and there's color explosions in this little bar.  And under the bar, there's scrolling news.  No one is reading that scrolling news.  There's the time.  There's the temp.  Up to the top.  They have to even tell you it's live.  I think we can at least figure that out.  I think we can figure out that they're talking live right now.  Television, they just...  They really should with that.  It's about time, that graphic. 
[01:31:00]  They just move it.  Get it?  Like, just move it to the left when you have to.  Because they're not going to get rid of that logo anytime soon.  How much do we need?  How much do you need on the TV screen?  Just get rid of it.  Yeah.  Plus, whether you're a stupid cable guy, you always know what channel you're on anyway.  Because you just...  You hit search and you just know where you're going.  And most people don't even care what channel they're on.  We don't care as much as they do.  It really affects golf coverage.  You know, here's a 50-foot putt and the logo's right over the hole.  Yeah, right over the hole. 
[01:31:30]  You can't see it.  Every single time.  And that's just terrible production.  Listen, they just have a lot of bad people involved.  And they probably need to fire a lot of people and get rid of them.  They don't know how to do water...  If they don't know how to do the watermarking, then they should just get rid of these people.  Yeah.  And get new people in there who are a little more internet savvy and know how to kind of mix a video  and not show the key part.  Yeah, you can't see the key part of the video.  Under a logo.  God, they suck.  All right.  Let's get to the Ernest Borgnine clip.  Ooh, Ernie Borgnine, I like to call him. 
[01:32:00]  Ernie.  I think he's got a book talking about his life or something.  He was on one of these local news channels.  It's a cool book.  It's called I Actually Died Five Years Ago.  He's still rocking, man.  91.  He's still rocking.  Is he really rocking?  No.  You've got to see the video.  In his own feces.  You've got to see the video.  Not only is he still rocking, I think he would beat the crap out of us.  I don't think he could take a 91-year-old Ernest Borgnine.  I don't think it's possible.  No?  You don't want to meet the Duke, Snake. 
[01:32:30]  Stupid Isaac Hayes.  Blinking rapidly.  Here we go.  To the show, show.  But real quickly, you're 91 years old.  You look fantastic.  You look like you're in your late 60s, early 70s.  What's the secret?  I don't dare tell you.  No me.  You don't need me.  I masturbate a lot.  Okay, I think...  He leaned over and whispered it. 
[01:33:00]  Where was that?  Fox, uh...  He's got a mic on, dummy.  Yeah, he's an older man.  He whispered it.  Oh, my God.  He did a Jesse Jackson.  He did his Jesse Jackson impression.  Is this thing on?  Because I'm about to tell you something.  All right, this is between you and I, right?  Okay.  You know how during an interview, they'll put, like, Ernest Borgnine in the graphic and then  put, like, maybe something he just said?  Yeah.  They ought to put that on the comments.  Yeah.  Ernest Borgnine. 
[01:33:30]  Hmm.  He just said.  Yeah.  The clip's up on onaradio.com.  Look at him, though.  For 91?  Come on.  Come on.  He looks great.  Looks the same as he ever did.  He's always looked old.  He leans over and whispers this and what's-his-name's ear there.  No meat.  You don't eat meat.  I masturbate a lot.  Okay.  I think we're all.  What?  Thank you, Ernie.  That was great.  I actually heard that.  Ernie, have you ever been on YouTube?  Have you ever been? 
[01:34:00]  Listen.  Listen.  Yesterday.  Yesterday.  What are you talking about?  I like this guy.  Okay, we're going to take a quick timeout.  He'll be in the after the show.  So I'm on to FoxandFriends.com.  I just shook his hand.  Oh, hey.  That's kind of funny.  I just shook his hand.  Wouldn't it be funny if he shook his hand and he wasn't kidding?  Like how to wipe it on his pants or something.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:34:30]  Fast forward an hour.  Guy's rinsing tapioca off his fingers.  What happened?  That's the best we could do with that clip because we weren't even allowed to play it  until about an hour ago.  That's all right.  That clip is everywhere today.  Talking about longevity.  Yeah.  See there, Jim?  Don't be saying that.  Mr. Norton, you're 3,500 years old.  What's your secret, my friend?  What else is going on?  By that time, my elbow will be snapped like that bodybuilder. 
[01:35:00]  Maybe shaking on your bed, arm bent behind your head.  His elbow just couldn't take it anymore.  It finally gave out.  I wish we had some music or something.  What?  Some music.  I'm going to move for music.  Yeah.  Tell you the truth.  Yeah.  I'd like to hear some live music.  Some live music.  Singing.  Singing.  Somebody maybe has some singing talent in here.  Oh, Steve?  Oh, of course.  Yeah, Steve.  We gave him one lousy assignment while we were away, and he was supposed to sing some 
[01:35:30]  acoustic foundry music today.  Let's get him in.  Is it acoustic, or are we going to maybe do a karaoke-type version?  We can do whatever.  I bet you, Steve, could still belt it out.  Steve?  Yep.  How was your vacation?  That was wonderful.  Thank you very much.  What'd you do?  I had a staycation, and at the end of it, we went to Ant's house.  Yes, every woman's there.  I got lots of rest.  I was very glad for it.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  Cool.  Nice and relaxed.  Yes.  Yeah, good.  Working on the pipes all week?  No.  But I was warned, you better not sing in front of them before you sing in front of me.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Your lady friend wants you to sing in front of her?  Yeah, my girl wants me to sing for her.  It's a gentleman friend.  Yeah, my girl wants me to sing for her.  What does she want you to sing?  Um, she wants me to sing one of her favorite country songs, and I just, I said, I will, 
[01:36:30]  I will, I will, and it's just-  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  We're onto something.  Why don't you practice on the show?  She's going to sing country?  What's her favorite country song?  Yeah.  Uh, it's a Rascal Flat song, and the name of which is escaping me right now, because  I'm, can't think of it, but, uh...  How's it go?  Like, what's the tempo?  Does anybody know?  Oh, it's very...  Get out of my way.  Is that, wait, is that a big song?  No.  No, it's not one of their bigger songs, so it's not something that would be-  Well, we gotta hear it now.  What, you don't know the title, or...  Somebody out there will get it, if you'd give us some clue. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  Um, I'm trying to think.  It's not one of the bigger ones.  It was one of, like, the first ones on one of their first albums, so it's not, it's not  anything that's too recent.  Um, but yeah, I got the warning that, uh, that if I don't, if, if, if I don't sing in  front of her first, then I better not sing, uh, I better not sing in front of you guys,  because she's been asking me for nine months.  So, so obviously you're going to be singing today for us, right?  But it's, you know, it's for the show, so that falls into a different category.  Sure, sure, otherwise you'll have all day to sing in front of her.  Yes.  You'll be from six to nine, have nothing to do. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, no kidding.  Speaking of, um, so you're not prepared, right?  Uh, you know, I know the song, but is it a song called Assless Chaps?  Ooh.  No.  Well, how about, uh, you practice and you give us a little something something after the  break?  Okay.  You gotta do something, you gotta give us something.  All right, I will practice, I will, uh, I will practice my song.  And I will go, and I'll give you something after, uh, after the break.  Cool.  Um, speaking of country songs, I don't know if, if anyone's going to care about this, 
[01:38:00]  but, uh, the iMan, uh, sent me an email.  Yeah.  Uh, he was checking in and I told him how much I hate Fareed now.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, this, this dopey Fareed that supposedly, uh, we were close with.  And, uh, you know, he takes us off a bunch of stations without even a phone call or an  explanation.  That's, that's, that's a wonderful way to run a radio company.  And, you know, uh, I miss is on a lot of Fareed stations, right?  Yeah.  So he, uh, he writes me, want me to find out what's up with Fareed?  And then he goes, have you heard? 
[01:38:30]  She left me for Jesus by Hayes Carl.  Hmm.  He's, he's, I miss is calling it the greatest country song ever, ever in big capital letters  written.  Hmm.  And like I said, I don't know if this is even worth bringing up on the air.  I don't know.  But you want to like, uh, listen to a piece of this song and see country moment and see  why he thinks is the greatest country song ever written.  You got it.  All right.  This is, uh, she left me for Jesus by Hayes Carl. 
[01:39:00]  God, I hope this is the most racist country song ever.  How great would this be?  Since high school, we never once left this town We used to go out on the weekends  And we drank till we drowned But now she's acting funny  And I don't understand I think that she's found some other man 
[01:39:30]  She left me for Jesus And that just ain't fair  I think Imus is losing his mind  That little taste  Just because Imus knew him personally  Doesn't mean  She's a great song  She's one of those born-again, uh, broads  Yeah  Born-again broads 
[01:40:00]  All right  All right, so we got, uh, we got Steve, he's getting ready to sing, right?  Yes  We'll do that after the, after the next break  Steve's gonna sing for us  You know, uh, Steve was, uh, Stephen Carr  Back in a little band called Foundry  Ooh  A year's back  Mm-hmm  Get some rotten tomatoes  Love to flow  Just throw them out on, like, old-school cabbage  Rotten fruit  Yeah, just things that they would throw in the 20s  Yeah  The King Kong show  I'll have a few jokes I'd like to throw in there 
[01:40:30]  You and me both  One's that would even get us booted from satellites  Exactly  Let's go to Tim in Boston  Tim  Just wanted to let Steve know that it didn't even sound like he was working on his improv skills  Either during the vacation  Like, I think  Why?  What did he say that was badly improv?  Um, when you asked him about his girlfriend, uh, if it was his boyfriend  He said, yes, my girlfriend 
[01:41:00]  This is it  Oh, I didn't even  He didn't even want to acknowledge  No  Yes, I'm not going for  I won't acknowledge your gay jokes anymore  What a queer  And then you got, uh, Burger King bath, dude  I kind of like this a lot, actually  Guy would celebrate his birthday by taking a bath in the big Burger King sink  Did you see this video?  Oh, yeah, yeah  What an ass 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, I took a look at that one  What an ass  Uh, here's the story  This is just a portion of almost four minutes of shocking video posted on MySpace.  What's shocking about it, really?  It's not.  Oh.  Posted on MySpace, it captures the employee self-described Mr. Unstable bathing nude in a large stainless steel sink  as several other employees and a store manager witnessed the incident.  Though they don't appear to do anything to stop the sink shenanigans, 
[01:42:00]  the video began to make its rounds throughout the community Monday morning with an attached warning.  One recipient, the Greene County Health Commissioner, Mark McDonald.  McDonald immediately sent back to the Xenia Burger King store to investigate the numerous health care violations.  He says the restaurant was aware of the incident and has already taken steps to clean up.  A guy named McDonald is going to Burger King to rat him out on health issues?  Yeah.  That seems like a conflict.  You can't account for everybody's stupid actions, but when things do happen, 
[01:42:30]  if you respond quickly to it and take the appropriate action, that's reassuring.  But some diners...  This is brilliant, though.  The guy's shocking video.  Everyone's trying to figure out their YouTube video.  The guy figured it out.  This thing's huge.  He's naked in there.  Yeah, he's just naked in the huge sink.  In the back.  What's shocking about it?  It's a dumb sink.  I know.  They're not cooking the food in the sink.  They wash the dishes in it. 
[01:43:00]  Obviously, the guy's got to get fired and all that, but it's not shocking.  I don't think you really could let this guy continue after this.  No, no.  But they're called shocking like they're flipping burgers in the sink.  They're using bubbles.  Doesn't it look like it would be really gross to sit in there?  Yeah.  Very greasy.  With the background, Burger King background?  Why would you do that?  But some diners don't agree.  Crystal Dodge says she used to eat at Burger King all the time.  That's just...  It's wrong. 
[01:43:30]  I mean, this is a place where families come to eat.  Oh, shut up.  When taking a bath in the sink, that's just not work ethic.  Do you know what you're putting in your system, you dumb broad?  It's not work ethic.  If you're bringing your family to eat there,  You're right.  Like, it's a health...  Right, right.  Like, it's a fancy...  I almost said the Olive Garden.  I stopped myself.  That's a fancy place.  Like, it's some kind of vegetarian cuisine they're, uh...  Scarfing down. 
[01:44:00]  Shut up.  It's a family place.  Exactly.  No families bathe.  How many calories are in that crap?  Shut up.  Shut up.  Yeah, he looks like a real, uh...  Wild guy.  He probably knew he was going to get fired, but it's worth getting fired from a Burger King job.  Yeah.  Go to McDonald's.  I'll never hire you.  Aren't you the guy who put his bag in the sink?  Make it sound like he's some kind of CEO of a company.  It's a dumb prank at Burger King. 
[01:44:30]  Uh, Anthony on Long Island.  What's up?  Yeah, I wanted to ask a question to Jimmy about the Bob Saget roast.  Yes.  Um, why was Norm MacDonald so not funny?  Was there an inside joke?  I thought Norm was funny.  What he did was Norm, uh, did this character where he was just like an old man.  And jokes, like completely innocent, goody two-shoe jokes.  Like he said, uh, he said, uh, like one of his jokes was, Bob takes vitamins A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. 
[01:45:00]  So how come he still looks like H?  Like instead of hell.  Like, that was the tone of his jokes.  It was so purposeful.  That's funny.  And once people caught on to what he was doing, people started to really laugh.  He totally committed to it.  It was totally different.  Yeah, completely the opposite of what a roast is supposed to be.  That's why he's so great.  And he was trying to make dumb Bob laugh.  And that's what he was doing.  You either love him or absolutely just hate the guy.  There's no in between with Norm MacDonald. 
[01:45:30]  I thought it was really funny, man.  And I didn't...  We have a set?  Can we get a little taste of Norm MacDonald?  I haven't seen the roast yet.  I saw part of his, uh, yeah, they, they, I was happy with the way my set came out,  but they took a tremendous amount of stuff, obviously.  But some of the ones they took out, I was like, ah.  But whatever, it's a time issue, too.  Like good ones?  Well, yeah.  I mean, I, I did a lot of them on the, and just to say Chloris Leachman's genitals.  And, uh, what about her breasts that they took out?  I was like, ah.  Oh, oh, one of the jokes they took out. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I thought you meant a breast.  Oh, okay, yes.  The fact that you were joking about it.  Oh, no.  I'm kidding, of course.  All right, when we get back.  Oh, God, I hope there was.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, I hope that wasn't an issue.  I didn't know it.  Oh, boy.  Ew.  How do you check that one out first?  Yeah, exactly.  Give a quick hug.  Wow, that didn't even occur to me.  You never know.  Oh, no.  Because the joke I did.  Oh, no.  Let's just say I use this, the vulgar word for breasts. 
[01:46:30]  Yes.  But I said, Cloris Leachman is in legal action right now.  She's suing Rotten Tomatoes for naming a website after her breasts.  And I was like, oh, my God.  Oh, God.  That's funny, man.  I hope there was a lot.  That is good.  I didn't know about it.  Rotten Tomatoes.  Come on.  Oh, what if she's just sitting there?  Oh, God, I hope not.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  The padded bra.  That would make me feel worse than anything I've ever said in my life. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  I didn't know it.  She was hilarious.  Yikes.  All right.  We'll do some mopping up.  And one of those things will be Steve singing after the break.  Please.  You better do some singing for us after the break.  And improv.  You know what I like?  Uh-oh.  By the way.  What?  I like this new setup here.  I have nothing against E-Rock.  But it is nice when we go to break to not hear, go!  Go!  Go!  Holy Jesus.  What was wrong with him?  He couldn't just sit there. 
[01:47:30]  I see Danny's got the headset, Mike.  He puts it right against his mouth and does a little, you know, go.  Like you don't hear it.  He was like on mic.  Break!  Go!  Like he's sending paratroopers out the door.  We're going to miss E-Rock.  He was fun, though.  E-Rock?  Where's he going?  What?  What?  He's not sitting there anymore.  He's gone, bro.  You didn't know that.  Oh, you won't see him no more.  No, he can't go.  E-Rock can't go.  He's gone.  What are you talking about?  Have you seen him yet today?  Where's E-Rock?  I saw him in the morning. 
[01:48:00]  There's Travis.  Beautiful Travis behind the glass.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Where are we?  Danny is now at the helm back there.  Where is Dummy Rock?  You know what?  I don't even know if I saw him this morning.  You did not.  Stunt Brain.  I won't be seeing him no more.  Stunt Brain had a plan.  Hey, Danny.  Oh, wow.  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Winning, win, win!  Now, first day back from vacation.  Opie and Anthony, thanks for checking us out today. 
[01:48:30]  We appreciate it.  We're kind of going over all the stuff we missed while we were gone.  A lot of good stuff happened while we were gone.  A lot of good Olympic stuff.  A nice little war flared up.  Ah.  Russia and Georgia.  Yeah.  I didn't know Atlanta had firepower.  Yes, very, very, uh, you know, the Russians invaded Georgia, and we didn't even know about  it.  But after you take out Atlanta, then what else is there to do?  Um, well, they actually retreated after seeing Freaknik. 
[01:49:00]  They got very scared, ran off.  I like the fact the Soviets are back.  I like that they did this.  I like the fact, I want the Soviets to start taking countries back over again.  Start taking them again.  I can deal with them before religious fanatics any day, and I kind of want the European Union.  You've been piping up for a long time.  To go, hey, but what about these guys here?  Yeah, how about the Russians start marching in and go, you know what, Romania, we don't 
[01:49:30]  like what's happening over here.  So you're ours again.  We're rebuilding.  That's what they should do, those Russians.  They need the Soviet Union back.  Who knew we'd actually be wanting the Soviets back?  I can't wait to get them back.  When that Iron Curtain came down, we were all happy.  Everybody's like, yay, we won.  Ugh.  Won what?  A Europe that can't stand us and holds their Euro over our head?  And religious fanatics that blow our crap up? 
[01:50:00]  Those Soviets, they knew how to handle stuff.  Like, I don't like the Chinese communism.  That's not fun.  They don't really do a lot of muscle flexing around the world.  They're good with the money.  They're good with taking our cash and selling us rubber vomit, whatever the hell they do.  But, you know, those Russians, they were good at keeping Europe quiet and on their toes.  The Chinese, for some reason, don't need to muscle flex.  Everyone is scared of the Chinese.  Yeah.  Sheer numbers, they win.  You just know that if the Chinese get into it in a war situation, it's going to be a major problem. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  No one's giving them any trouble.  Yeah.  You can't even be involved in a little altercation with them.  There's a billion of them.  Yeah.  There's a billion of them.  There's a billion weapons.  They'll just send people over to punch you.  Over and over again.  Imagine that.  There's just like 50 guys punching every one person.  Ow.  Stop it.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Yeah, but the Russians are getting a little spunky again. 
[01:51:00]  Good.  That's good to see.  Is Putin still there?  No, he's gone.  Do you leave?  Putin.  Yeah.  He's the puppet master.  Yeah.  Yeah, is he?  Hey, Steve was giving me a little earful in the office.  Oh, how'd it feel?  Warm?  I figured this is really...  How do you have to reciprocate?  I guess his girl, wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Yes, wink, wink.  Or is it...  Didn't we see this girl at the pool party?  Yeah.  Yeah, so she exists.  Of course.  All right, I'm just asking.  Oh, yeah.  No, she's very real, and she's upset that I agreed to sing before. 
[01:51:30]  I agreed to sing on air before I agreed to sing to her, and I understand how, and she's  understandably upset with me right now.  Understandably.  I don't know.  I understand.  Why understandably?  Why?  Because she's been asking me for eight months, I think, to sing her song for her, and I  haven't...  Tell her to toughen up.  Yeah.  Toughen up.  Toughen up.  And Steve, by the way, doesn't she see that we're helping the cause?  Because by you singing for the show, that you'd be more inclined to sing for her, because 
[01:52:00]  you've done it publicly again.  Yeah, I've tried that one, and no, that doesn't work.  That doesn't work.  So...  What I have, here's what I...  I actually found the lyrics to my song.  Okay.  What I think I can do...  Oh, what do you mean you found it?  You haven't sung that in a long time.  I haven't sung it in a long time, dude.  It's been 10 years.  Where'd you find it?  In an old Word document that I found online.  What?  Yeah.  And what I can do is, I think I can recite the lyrics. 
[01:52:30]  I can recite the lyrics.  Oh, no.  No?  No.  Why not?  No.  No.  No.  I can't sing them.  Yes, you can.  No, I still understand.  You're singing.  You have to sing.  You have to.  Inexcusable.  Yeah, you have to.  Inexcusable.  There is a, wow, unbelievable amount of, a certain type of whipped that you are.  Yeah, wow.  I didn't want to say it.  Yeah.  So that's what you've decided that you could recite the lyrics and she'll still be...  And I won't get the lashing that I will. 
[01:53:00]  Well, it's worth it.  Oh, boy.  I think for the radio show.  I think it's worth it.  You have to.  Yeah.  You don't do anything wrong.  I'm not saying I won't.  I just got to do it.  Yeah, you knew us.  You have to belt it out.  You knew us years before her.  What's her Rascal Flat song?  It's a song called I'm Moving On.  Okay, good.  You sing that, too.  That's what she'll be doing.  Why don't we pick that up?  Why don't we pick that up for her, for Steve, so we can do both of these.  Kill two birds.  How about you sing to her through the radio show?  Right.  It's a radio.  That's perfect. 
[01:53:30]  There you go.  Perfect.  Perfect.  And then you could go home and go, I sang to you.  Yeah.  Perfect.  I hope I honestly...  It's perfect, Steve.  Steve, I wonder if that would not get my ass kicked.  You'll live.  Come on.  Wait.  Can we get her on the phone so you can sing to her?  Oh.  Yeah, you want to sing to her on the...  On the air through the phone.  Sure.  She's at work now.  She can't get...  What's that?  How is she listening to the show?  What?  How is she listening to the show?  I think she just got there, so she heard it in the car, and this has been a prolonged...  All right, we'll just lie to her afterwards, say, no, I didn't do it. 
[01:54:00]  I said no.  Yeah.  She's not listening.  She's not listening.  She's at work.  What are you going to sing for us today, Steve?  Yes.  Give me the pendulum.  I'll sing that.  Ah.  Oh, boy.  I can recite the lyrics.  He's like the Lone Ranger.  He can't wear his mask.  What was that about?  The Lone Ranger did public appearances, but he wasn't allowed to wear the mask.  He wasn't allowed, yeah.  Clay...  Clayton Moore.  Clayton Moore.  Clayton Moore, sure.  And they would not allow him to wear it.  They wouldn't allow him to wear the trademark mask, so he walked around wearing those big 
[01:54:30]  old men cataract glasses.  No crap.  He walked around with these big black sunglasses that people wear after cataract surgery.  Why wouldn't they let him wear it?  Was he a dick, or was there a reason?  No, I think they said it's their property, and...  What scum.  He should have worn it.  He's like, God, sue me.  God, what scumbags.  He should have just worn one of those Mardi Gras, like, freaking...  One of those masks on a stick.  One of the little fancy ones on a stick that you wear to a costume pole. 
[01:55:00]  Or he should have just taken the franchise down and wore a pink one and a hat and a dress  and went, hi-yo, silver!  And just been a queen.  Give favors to everybody.  Yeah.  Just have that mask just soaked by the time he's done.  Yeah, and had, like, a really gay Indian with him, Tinto.  Like, just change it a little.  You know, Tinto's a twink.  Yes.  Steve, do you want me to read some of the instant feedback or not?  It's really up to you.  I'm sure...  No, I don't.  Man up, you queer, and sing.  No.  All right, go ahead. 
[01:55:30]  Cut right to the chase.  That's a little contradictory, but all right.  All right, so I want Steve to be okay.  All right, what are we doing now?  Foundry?  I got whatever you want.  Are you going to sing along to your own band?  Yeah, give me the Foundry one.  All right, here we go.  Steve, for the first time, singing Foundry live on our show.  Oh, there he is.  Hi, Sam.  With the camera?  I'm going to be left there.  Cool.  Yeah. 
[01:56:00]  Angela will swing at the center of attention.  Just another day, another condescension.  Mock you, shock you, it's going to lock you down.  The pendulum will shift with a little bit of pressure. 
[01:56:30]  Move too slow, and the pendulum will catch you.  Show you, oh, yeah, it's going to throw you around.  You did the crime and not the time.  Now you've got to pay for what you've done.  You better run.  I've had all I can take of all your screaming in my ear.  My back is going to break if you push me one more time. 
[01:57:00]  Heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  You changed me into something that I just can't control.  If you see me coming, best get out of my way.  The Vangelum is swinging back the other way.  Wow, you're Johnny Bravo.  He's rocking.  Yeah.  He's Johnny Bravo, though.  He's belting it out.  Too bad he doesn't love his girl.  Thank you, Jim. 
[01:57:30]  I'll have you call her and explain this.  Bump you and chump you, he's going to dump you out.  The Vangelum will break under too much tension down the walls of my detention.  Wrecking ball and kingdom falling down.  You did the crime and not the time. 
[01:58:00]  Now you've got to pay for what you've done.  You better run.  I've had all I can take of all your screaming in my ear.  Back is going to break if you push me out one more time.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  You changed me into something that I just can't control.  If you see me coming, best get out of my way.  The Vangelum is swinging back the other way.  Rock.  Damn. 
[01:58:30]  Guitar solo.  Rock.  Ouch.  There it is.  Obligatory guitar solo, by the way.  Heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  You changed me into something that I just can't control.  If you see me coming, best get out of my way.  The pendulum is swinging back the other way. 
[01:59:00]  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  You changed me into something that I just can't control.  If you see me coming, best get out of my way.  The Vangelum is swinging back the other way.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  You changed me into something that I just can't control.  And if you see me coming, best get out of my way.  The Vangelum is swinging back the other way. 
[01:59:30]  Wow.  Very good.  Thank you, sweetie.  Steve, I didn't think Steve would belt it out like that.  Steve, the second half of it out.  The second half was much better than the first.  He got relaxed, I think.  Yeah, I calmed down a little bit.  Wow.  Yeah, you calmed down a little bit.  So when is the pendulum going to start swinging and be straight?  Well, somebody decided. 
[02:00:00]  Let's go to Sean and Johnny.  Sean, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm going to roast you, Amy.  Hi, thank you.  You got it.  Hey, did anybody catch on that Steve's rhyming way with way?  I didn't notice that.  No, it's the Vietnam city of way.  That's right.  No, I had some curds and something with them.  What lazy writing he's writing.  We rhymed way with way.  Lazy songwriter. 
[02:00:30]  I know, the rhyme for us is so obvious.  And that's how you write a song.  The reviews are coming in.  They're really good.  Dan on Long Island.  Dan, what do you got?  If you guys think Steve's doing a good job, you guys should be American Idol fucking judges.  Whoa.  Oh, my person.  Oh, my person.  Oh. 
[02:01:00]  That wasn't even a good place to throw in the F word.  I know.  You know.  F an American Idol.  Yeah.  That didn't.  You threw one away there, man.  Yeah.  Paul and Randy, they do such a good job.  Yeah.  They got Idol tryouts in Jersey today.  Oh, I bet.  Why didn't we send one of our guys?  We're dumb.  We said that last year.  Send Steve.  Big A.  Sing to Angela.  Big A.  Stuttering his way through his audition.  That's right.  They're at the.  Imagine Steve there singing.  Yeah.  Now, I'd like to sing for you, but my girlfriend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we have a rascal flat saw. 
[02:01:30]  I think that.  Dude, my voice is now.  No, you sound good.  No, I don't.  I think that'd be.  Maybe you can sing it soft.  You don't have to yell it.  Oh, here it is, Steve.  You know the words?  No, I don't.  That's what you're not.  All right.  Make them up.  Do we have them printed out?  Can someone print out the words?  Can we do a one-sided.  Yeah.  Can we do a one-sided phone conversation?  Could you call your girl and tell her that you just sang on the air and see what she says?  There's a fiddle in this song.  I think it's one of those.  Steel guitar?  I've dealt with my ghost and I've faced all my demons. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, boy.  Boo!  I'm enjoying this.  Are you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You also enjoyed your nose surgery.  That's a good point.  Boo!  I've been burdened with blame, trapped in the past for too long.  Grr.  Grr. 
[02:02:30]  I get it.  Your life was tough and you turned it all around, didn't you?  Shut up.  Yeah.  Boo!  He's country?  Yeah.  Did he call her?  Yeah.  There you go.  Steve's calling his girl.  One-sided phone conversation.  He was supposed to sing to her first.  Not us.  Yeah.  Got me a little choked up.  I want to hear that one-sided conversation. 
[02:03:00]  Okay.  Hello?  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  No.  I don't.  Yeah.  No.  I.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye.  I think he's fake calling her.  No.  Oh, it's ringing.  It's ringing.  All right.  One ringy dingy.  Hi.  Oh.  I'm actually, you're not on the air, but I am.  And.  She should be.  I just, I just sang my song on the air.  Are you mad? 
[02:03:30]  Are you mad?  You are?  What if I sing the Rascal Flatts song?  Yeah?  Will I be in less trouble or more trouble if I do this?  This is the guy that sang Pendulum.  I know.  No.  Just get out of my way.  No.  She's got me.  Okay.  Fair enough.  I think she's going to put on the special belt tonight.  For saying.  Oh, Steve.  Tell her this conversation is over. 
[02:04:00]  What a giant sub, Steve.  What a giant sub.  I'm being nice.  He likes to be, like, tied up to, like, living posts and then left alone for hours in a dress.  On his tippy toes and high heels.  Tell you what.  I'll sing the Rascal Flatts song.  And you tell me how I do.  Ooh.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  Sexy.  Wait.  Someone's saying to listen to the lyrics of the song.  Love you.  The lyrics of the song is very telling.  Do we have the Rascal Flatts? 
[02:04:30]  Oh, okay.  How did that go, Steve?  Um, she's upset, but if I do a good job at the Rascal Flatts, I think I could redeem myself.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  She's upset because she didn't hear it?  Or she heard it?  No.  She told him that she had.  He had.  Yeah.  Well, actually, she had to sing to her first.  Yeah, I was instructed to sing to her first.  And because I gave it to you guys first, she's upset.  Where's the lyrics?  What happened? 
[02:05:00]  Oh, my gosh.  How did we not know that eight minutes ago?  Why would we have paper for the printer?  Why?  Why would we?  There's no one in that office that can do it.  Why would we?  Oh, wait.  Now we got some stuff.  Travis, what's going on?  Wait.  Let's do it in studio.  Jimmy, get back here.  What happened, Travis?  Nothing.  Why don't we have somebody in there?  We have people in there.  I said five.  Who's in there?  Who do you think is in there?  Oh, Eddie.  Bring him in here, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy, you got him. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, he might have gone to XM to set up.  Why?  Wait.  Jimmy's yelling in there with no mic.  This stinks.  Can you get both of them in here?  Oh, boy.  What?  His first day in there.  Yeah, we moved him basically to the mail room,  and he can't even do the mail room right.  Oh, all right.  Sorry, Iraq.  Sorry what?  I yelled at him, but I'm like, we have, I just yelled at him.  Oh, here comes Iraq.  What's the matter, Iraq? 
[02:06:00]  You're all beat up.  I have no idea.  And headphones on, and Jimmy's getting mad.  The interns are saying, why didn't we have this?  Travis sent something.  I don't know what's going on.  I was doing something else.  Hope we isolate that.  That's a good one.  All right.  I don't know what's going on.  I was doing something else.  He marched it out.  Well, Iraq, Iraq.  He marched it out, and he's slamming the door.  I'm so happy nothing has changed in 10 days. 
[02:06:30]  I miss this crap.  Fantastic.  Why would he know what's going on?  I don't know what's going on.  I don't even know what I'm doing here.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, boy, yeah.  Gotta love having the Iraq around.  All right.  Someone is saying that the Ima song, we cut it off way too soon,  and the second verse is pure radio gold.  Geez, well, what the hell were we, how were we supposed to know?  Yeah, I don't know. 
[02:07:00]  For the love of Pete.  Who said that, by the way?  Josh from Philly.  Roscoe Flats, I'm moving on.  We got the lyrics.  You want to sing this for your girl there, Steve?  Sure.  All right, here we go.  That's the mood.  Wait, no, it's...  No, no, no.  It's three times a lady?  Fruity tempo.  I've dealt with my ghosts and I've faced all my demons. 
[02:07:30]  Have you?  Finally tanned with a past I regret.  Do ya?  I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness.  Once I'm at peace with myself.  I've been burdened with blame.  Trapped in the past for too long. 
[02:08:00]  You're saying that to the world of vaginas.  I've lived in this place and I know all the faces.  Each one is different, but they're always the same.  Through a glory hole. 
[02:08:30]  But it's time that I'll face it.  It'll never allow me to change.  But I've never dreamed of what end up where I don't belong.  I'm moving on.  So get out of my way.  If the faces don't change, they'll have one eye and poke through a hole in the wall. 
[02:09:00]  Snake faces.  Has been patiently waiting for me and I know...  Ow.  There's no guarantees.  Not alone.  I'm not doing well.  Go ahead.  Everyone's life.  When all you can see are the years passing by. 
[02:09:30]  Have made up my mind that those days aren't gone.  The answer to the next line is fudge.  Okay.  Okay.  I sold what I could and I packed what I couldn't. 
[02:10:00]  Stopped to fill up on the way out of town.  I should, but live like I shouldn't.  Maybe you can't give me.  Down this road.  The old dirt road.  I'm moving on. 
[02:10:30]  I'm moving on.  I'm moving on.  Boom!  I got some water out of it, Jimmy.  Some coffee out of that new nose of yours.  Wow.  I like that song.  God damn it.  I didn't want to like it.  Oh, no you don't.  I'm going to get that off iTunes.  No, you're not.  I will.  What about the Jesus one? 
[02:11:00]  Can we get the Jesus one before we get out of here?  I like that Rascal Flatto.  It's a very pretty song.  Do you?  Not when I sing it, though.  Is that a chick?  It's horrible.  No, it's not.  What was that?  You've heard that song a few times, huh?  Oh, yeah.  I know.  I've been.  I can tell.  Did she play it for you and make you listen to the words?  No, I played it for myself.  She told me about it, and then I went and got it on iTunes.  That's a good song. 
[02:11:30]  What's the big deal with She Left Me For Jesus?  The lyrics gets good.  It gets good?  It certainly does.  It's a little risque.  Yeah, what?  Do we have to play it, or can we just give away the big reveal?  No, I would play it.  All right.  Imus sent me an email recently and said this is the greatest country song ever written.  Mm-hmm.  And now we're going to find out why he says that.  Right.  Okay.  She left me for Jesus.  High school.  We never once left this time. 
[02:12:00]  It's kind of like a game show buzzer.  This is what they said.  Jimmy just ripped one.  And we drink till we grind.  But now she's acting funny.  And I don't understand.  I think that she's found some other man.  She left me for Jesus. 
[02:12:30]  And that just ain't fair.  She says that he's perfect.  How could I compare?  She says I should find him.  And I love peace at last.  If I ever find Jesus, I'm kicking his ass.  Whoa. 
[02:13:00]  She showed me a picture.  All I could do was stare.  I hit that freak in his sandals.  Oh, and his long, pretty hair.  They must have made that I'm stupid.  Or I don't have a clue.  I bet he's a commie.  Or even worse yet, a Jew. 
[02:13:30]  Whoa.  What the hell?  She left me for Jesus.  And that just ain't fair.  She says that he's perfect.  How could I compare?  She says I should find him.  And I love peace at last.  If I ever find Jesus, I'm kicking his ass. 
[02:14:00]  All right.  We'll play this out.  We're off to XM Satellite Radio.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Sirius XM, Opie.  What?  Yes.  Dog XM.  All right.  Listen to the rest of this dumb song.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  We'll see you guys tomorrow. 
[02:14:30]  This time we made love, she even called out his name.  She left me for Jesus.  And that just ain't fair. 
[02:15:00]  She says that he's perfect.  How could I compare?  She says I should find him.  And I love peace at last.  If I ever find Jesus, I'm kicking his ass.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:15:30]  XM 202.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:16:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Tick tock.  Tick tock.  Tick tock.  Tick tock.  Forty three days and counting.  Oh, that's right.  But I do believe we're talking.  Good.  That's the headline today.  We're talking.  Yeah.  Not us.  People behind the scenes are doing some of that talking.  People that need to do the talking are talking.  Tackin, tackin, tackin.  Tackin, tackin.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton.  And let the laughs ensue.  We got the death ghoul on this side of the show today. 
[02:16:30]  Very cool guest, Dr. Michael Bodden.  Yeah.  But he did like five HBO specials.  The autopsy series.  And they're fascinating.  The autopsy series was fantastic.  You can't not.  Great.  You can't not enjoy watching a guy talk about death as knowledgeably and comfortably.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  You think this Michael Bodden likes death?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Loves it. 
[02:17:00]  Loves death.  He really loves death.  There was always a great.  That show, Autopsy, was always a good little mystery thing because they'd have a case.  And he would tell how they solve it through the autopsy and find out what the dead could  tell you.  It was the thing.  Like, the dead can tell their story.  I love when he finds, like, a fingernail.  Next thing you know, he could tell you it was a white male.  Well, yeah.  Between the age of 35 and 37.  And he drowned.  Perhaps we could ask him about that case. 
[02:17:30]  The one where they found, I believe it was the tip of a finger.  Yeah.  In a lake.  Yeah.  Where a man had put his wife through a wood chipper.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I bet you he can not only tell you what happened, but what she said to deserve it.  Well, should we bring him in?  He has a friend with him who's I know.  Hey, Roland, can we bring the good doctor in?  What, he's traveling with another ghoul?  He has another coroner friend with him.  I don't know if they like to be called ghouls.  Yes.  Perhaps not.  That's not the official. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, I know that guy.  Hey, I know you.  Hello, sir.  Hey, I know his colleague Peter Dean.  He's the coronary mother.  Yeah, you got some terrific eyebrows there, sir.  Hey, huh?  Sunburn.  What is he, doctor?  Sunburn, yeah.  Sure.  It's a serious American sunburn.  Show him how you do things here on tape.  Oh, satellite.  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't understand.  They don't do that in England, do they?  No.  We have a lot of terrestrial stuff.  A certain amount of satellite, but not satellite radios.  Yeah.  This is like a...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They don't have it over there.  You go ahead to the curb. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, you get the curse on this medium.  Well, you know.  I'm here to learn.  Yeah, put the headphones on there so you can hear everybody.  We get the headphones and...  Yeah.  Dr. Bodden, make yourself comfortable.  Bodden.  Thank you.  Dr. Bodden.  Yes.  We've done about 12 now, 12 HBO documentaries, one a year.  Oh, really?  Oh, I thought it was five.  Wow.  Well, that's okay.  You've been sleeping a little bit.  I've been very sorry.  Yeah, we were talking earlier how we enjoy the show. 
[02:19:00]  The show Autopsy was great, watching your specials, and you are so comfortable with the  subject, and it's...  Well, that's what I do.  I know.  The thing is...  You're comfortable sitting here, and I'm nervous.  Yeah, but you know something?  Your line of work is a little more disturbing than this.  It depends how you look at it.  Yeah?  When I started out, I started out as an internist at Bellevue Hospital, an intern resident, seeing  people die and not being able to do anything to help.  That's really disturbing.  Once they're dead, then they're out of pain and suffering. 
[02:19:30]  What's the worst that could happen?  You get a pulse.  We've had that happen a few times.  Really?  A guy goes to the morgue and sits up and says, what am I doing here?  Is that real?  Wow.  It does happen.  It happens because sometimes, especially in older people, the pulse becomes so faint  and the breathing becomes so faint that it's easily overlooked.  And after a few hours, they may come...  We've had a number of these in New York, but they're all over the States. 
[02:20:00]  So do you need that male nurse for?  That angel of death guy, you know, with the pillow?  What's with those guys, Dr. Bond?  Jesus.  That's the kind that we can't tell.  That's the pillow.  Yeah, that seems to be like a really...  Let's take that.  Let's run with that for a minute.  The old pillow over the nose thing when you suffocate somebody, how do you determine  that somebody was murdered or if they just died in their sleep?  Oh, we're on.  We're on.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, make sure you say fuck a lot. 
[02:20:30]  Watch your language, Opie.  The thing about that is that we don't like to give primers on how to kill people.  Well, I wouldn't, yeah, either.  But I must say that suffocation is the hardest diagnosis for a medical examiner to make.  Is it?  Because whereas shootings and stabbings and baseball bat injuries leave something to see  at autopsy.  If somebody suffocated, when the suffocating device, the hands or the pillow taken off,  everything pops back to normal. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  So those are the hardest.  It was easier when we had feather pillows because the feather pillows would often break  and they'd inhale the feathers.  Oh.  So when I first started out, we had a few people who had inhaled feathers in their windpipe  and lungs.  And we could say, hey, there's something wrong with this.  There's been something.  Yeah, I get it.  Go ahead, Jim.  Attacked and murdered by a chicken or something.  Well, how do they, don't they tell kids, don't the teeth leave a print in the back of your 
[02:21:30]  lip?  Oh.  You're pretty good at this.  Sometimes, it depends on the amount of force used or if something is pushed in the mouth,  like if a sock or something is pushed into the mouth to assist in the suffocation, it  can leave injuries on the tongue and the inside.  But if it's, one of the things that happens with the sudden infant death cases with babies  who don't struggle very much, they can get wrapped up in bedding or they can get wrapped 
[02:22:00]  up in plastic.  In the old days, they used to use plastic to prevent injuring the mattress when it could  urinate.  That's great.  Plastic.  They can get wrapped up.  It can cause death and not leave any signs.  So, those are things that we look at very carefully.  I just was watching, I like watching the A&E crime shows and they had a case where a man  had, he was suspected of killing his infant and they had it as SIDS and a few years prior 
[02:22:30]  he had another baby with another woman who died of SIDS and it turned out that they convicted  him of murder.  Right, well, the thing there is, and the HBO specials you're talking about, we've had  a couple of those where the way one often identifies suffocation of babies is it happens  again and again.  Right.  And that alerts the police and the investigators that this isn't just by chance. 
[02:23:00]  So, the ones that get caught are the ones who usually have more than one.  What's the toughest one you've ever worked on where you had to prove that somebody was  murdered and there really wasn't much evidence but you pulled it out?  Well, part of the problem is when we investigate a case as medical examiners, we're there not 
[02:23:30]  just to do something in prosecution, we're there to do something for either side.  So, our investigation is, was a crime committed.  Now, some of the tough ones are when we have a crime, the police think it's a crime and we  don't find any evidence of a crime and say so.  But I think the toughest one was a serial murder in Massachusetts where a nurse was thought  to possibly be poisoning veterans by injecting various potassium into the intravenous lines. 
[02:24:00]  This is about five or eight years ago.  I hear that's very hard to detect.  And, yes, it is detected because as soon as we die, the potassium starts getting screwed  up in the body.  The red cells break and all that.  And initially, there had been some identification by the toxicologist, but his information on  it was wrong. 
[02:24:30]  He had the wrong decimal point and the judge wouldn't let him testify.  So, we were able to make the identification in court, not by toxicology, but by the electrocardiogram,  which with potassium shows certain abnormalities, that is when the codes were called, they did  an EKG and we went back and were able to find some of the EKGs and able to establish the  toxicology, not by chemical analysis, but by clinical symptoms in electrocardiogram. 
[02:25:00]  That's kind of tough.  Did the person get convicted?  Yes.  A female nurse convicted, and it was in Massachusetts, which is a non-death penalty state.  But this was federal because it was in the federal VA hospital.  Oh, right.  So, I had to then testify at a sentencing hearing, and the prosecutors, the federal prosecutors 
[02:25:30]  were going for the death penalty in Massachusetts, and the jury voted 11 to 1 for capital punishment,  but because one person held out, she's in jail someplace in Texas.  Yeah, got to be unanimous.  And she's been in the news every now and then because she has had affairs with various prominent  female murderers.  Oh, really?  Wow.  In jail.  Love in the old prison.  In jail.  In prison.  That's great.  All right, so she's a good egg.  Yeah.  She's a fucking guller in jail.  How do you not like that? 
[02:26:00]  So, you've been involved with some really high-profile cases, too.  I didn't even realize, it said here, Sid Vicious's death.  Yeah, well, that was when I was the chief medical examiner in New York City, and Sid Vicious  had been arrested for stabbing Nancy Spungett at the Chelsea Hotel, a wonderful hotel in West  23rd Street that a lot of famous writers had lived in.  And he was in jail for stabbing Nancy Spungett, and he got bailout. 
[02:26:30]  He came out, and within a few days, he was dead from a drug overdose.  And when I went down there, his mom was there collecting his things down in Greenwich Village  someplace.  And he had a very high level of heroin, because he had lost his tolerance while he was in jail.  So he came out and shot up the same stuff.  Oh, wow.  And he died, because he didn't wait to gradually develop the tolerance. 
[02:27:00]  Wow, that'll happen?  Yeah.  And that's why often, it's amazing it doesn't happen more often, because addicts, there's  no FDA approval for what's in little packets.  And in the old days, when I started out in the 60s, 70s, when there was sort of organized  crime distribution of heroin, we'd analyze the packets, and they had pretty much the same  amount of heroin in them.  Then as more different groups came into it, and there was disorganized distribution of 
[02:27:30]  heroin, the amounts of heroin in a packet varied a great deal.  And if a kid, instead of taking the usual packets, took one from a different supplier and had more  heroin, he could die from an overdose.  So the overdoses increased.  Wow.  Yeah, you were head of the medical examiner's office in New York City.  And what year was that?  Because it was...  Oh, I was in the...  Sid Vicious was about 1978, 79.  I was in the office for about 25 years. 
[02:28:00]  Gee, so you probably saw a lot coming through there, huh?  Oh, we...  Yes.  We had...  We were up to 2,000 homicides a year then.  Yeah, yeah.  And now it's down to about 500 or so.  Yeah, 2,000 a year during the time you were in there.  Was it during the Koch years, or is that...  That was, yeah.  Koch and Dinkins.  Koch years, right?  And that...  Wow.  That's a lot of work.  Yeah.  We had a lot more homicides than in England.  In England, where they used to not have guns, you know. 
[02:28:30]  Ah, right.  There was a lot less murders.  But there's a lot more stabbings, I think.  A lot more st...  Yeah.  They're still angry.  They're just using different tools.  That's right.  But usually, see, the thing is, when you stab somebody, usually you don't kill them.  You know?  A gunshot wound to the head is pretty devastating, or to the chest.  But stabbing, you have, a person's more likely to survive.  Unless it's one of those multiple, just, you know, over and over gang gang.  Anger. 
[02:29:00]  Well, like, you know, O.J. will take that whole thing.  Well, see, there you are again.  O.J., the jury said he was not guilty.  Of course they did.  And you go along, you probably even think Lizzie Borden was guilty.  I, well, you know, they made up a little rhyme about her.  It has to be, it has to be true.  That's PR.  Even back then, it was about 1890s, Lizzie Borden took an axe, gave her father...  Her mother 40 whacks.  When she saw what she had done, she gave her father 41.  41, yeah.  Now, the hip-hop culture of that day... 
[02:29:30]  That was a rap song.  ...still lives with us.  And it obscures the fact that she was found that guilty.  That was some gangster rap back then.  Wow.  In England.  Now, what do you know what...  No, no, that was, excuse me, that was in Massachusetts.  On that Massachusetts, yeah.  Fall River.  What, uh, uh, the O.J. thing.  Now, obviously, I detect a tad bit of sarcasm.  Um, what, and I know it's ancient history at this point, but what do you think went wrong  with that case? 
[02:30:00]  I mean, they had him.  Well, I think partly, in the United States, the, uh, government has to prove its case.  And I think, uh, the general agreement, even the people who think, uh, that O.J., like,  uh, uh, uh, Bugliosi, uh, Bugliosi, who wrote a big thing about it, and others who were  violently, uh, thought that, uh, O.J. had done it, they all agreed that the prosecution  failed to prove its case.  Mm-hmm.  I think the criticism, in large measure, is the prosecution, uh, didn't present its case 
[02:30:30]  effectively.  You testified for...  I was surprised, because I was a fan, uh, I was surprised when you testified, uh, for  the defense.  It actually made me kind of question, like, well, you know, what, what kind of evidence  must they have then, because they got Dr. Biden testifying?  What was, what was the basis of them asking you to testify?  Well, I, the basis, there were two bases, which, um, and one has to be careful in, in  these cases.  We don't testify, I don't testify as to guilt or innocence.  Right.  I testify as to certain points. 
[02:31:00]  And with every medical examiner testifies in, in a case, then, like an O.J., there may  have been 50 or 60 other people testifying, uh, who may have had more impact on the jury.  But one of the things was that the, the medical examiner testified from the stab wound of the  young man Goldman's, uh, uh, body, that the person who did the, um, uh, who did the stabbing  was right-handed, about six feet tall, and, uh, stabbed him, uh, from the front. 
[02:31:30]  Um, and I, you can't tell that from an, an unwitness stabbing, it could have been a midget  stabbing him, who was left-handed, stabbing him from the back.  Yeah, I always thought that was a little odd on TV shows, especially where they're like,  he's obviously, he was right-handed, and you're like, what?  He voted Democrat, look at the stab wound.  Yeah, unless, unless somebody sees the positions they're in, facing each other or something,  um, there's no hint at, to whether it's left-handed or right-handed.  And that was one of the issues that I test, right, it's, it's, that they, it added in a 
[02:32:00]  lot of bad, bad information with the good information.  They had a lot of good information, I think the DNA evidence was really good.  Yeah.  Except that it was presented, it was presented wonderful for a physician.  I loved their five days of testimony on DNA, uh, but somebody who just graduated from high  school isn't going to understand what they said.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  So one of the things that we're very, uh, concerned about, uh, in testimony is how does  the jury understand what we're saying? 
[02:32:30]  Right.  It's like, you must have guests who'll come in and they'll say wonderful things in PhD  terms that are true, but nobody understands it.  Right, right.  Except, and I think that's partly what happened in OJ also.  So there's like a real, there's a misconception.  Testifying for the defense just means that they called you to talk about a certain piece of  medical evidence, but it does get presented like, oh, Dr. Biden must have thought he was  innocent because he was, uh.  I agree.  I'm glad you said that.  That doesn't at all mean that when I testify for the prosecution though, because 90% of 
[02:33:00]  the time I, I work now with the New York state police.  I worked in New York city for 25 years.  Uh, I would hope that they got the right guy, but the, the, uh, thing about it would be that  the, the testimony I give theoretically could be, uh, useful for either side.  Uh, and, um, uh, we have to be fair and now half the time in my, when I'm asked to testify  in private, I'll give an opinion and I won't be called to testify because my opinion doesn't  agree with the, um, uh, theory of the, of the, uh, defense attorneys. 
[02:33:30]  So when I get to testify, it's because the, the lawyers think I'll be helpful.  But at the same time, um, you don't know, the public doesn't know all the times we don't  testify because the, because your opinion, we disagree.  Wow.  See, I'm glad, uh, I figured there was a reason for it, but it's like, you don't realize  like, oh, they would call different guys just to talk about one piece of the evidence.  Yeah.  And, uh, yeah, look, if the prosecution is saying you can tell by stab wounds stuff about 
[02:34:00]  a guy, you can't tell.  That's right.  You know, all right, well, they got to bring in somebody to counter that.  What creeps you out?  Like, does any of this death stuff creep you out ever?  Yeah.  What would creep me out when I started and still is young kids and children who are, um, innocents.  So much of what we do as medical examiners, the victim is often, um, uh, involved in the  death, you know, the, the alcoholic who gets in a fight or the drug addict who gets killed 
[02:34:30]  by a pusher or in a family affair, the, the spouse who's been in a terrible marriage and  fighting and all that for years.  And one kills the other, uh, there's, it's, it's all sad, but there's, uh, an understanding  of that.  When a parent or stranger kills a kid, um, uh, who's perfectly innocent, especially when  I had kids the same age, it really was creepy.  Even this creepy, this Kaylee case, that's a Kaylee Anthony that's going on now in Florida. 
[02:35:00]  Um, is this the guy who killed the little brother?  And it's just, I'm not sure.  It is the mom.  It is the mom.  Who's in jail and refused to say what happened to her.  Yeah.  The kid is missing.  A 20 year old kid.  Yep.  That's really creepy because he has an innocent kid.  And obviously there are things going on that, uh, um, are upsetting.  Can you think of one case though, that was the most, like, I guess it's hard when you  look at, say 10 different stranger children, you can't pick which one, but is it one that  stands out for you that was just the most enraging or the most upsetting? 
[02:35:30]  Well, the only one I ever cried at, I actually cried when I was asked to be ahead of the  Pussy.  I'm kidding.  It is, it is, okay.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's sensitive.  I understand.  I had to.  The, the only one that I, that I really, tears came out was when I examined the Kennedy,  John F. Kennedy autopsy for the select committee on assassinations that was established back 
[02:36:00]  in 1978, 79 to review the deaths of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King.  And I looked at that autopsy in the photographs and there was such a terrible kind of autopsy  and photographs where there wasn't a proper cleaning of the body and the proper attention  paid, you know, to show our president who had been killed and to show what I would consider  not proper respect for the remains, what really upset me, apart from the fact that they got 
[02:36:30]  the, the entrance and the exit and the trajectory wrong, you know, in our president, when, when  the, that autopsy was done by hospital pathologists who never had any experience doing gunshot wounds.  And one of the problems, uh, when I started out in the sixties, 80%, 85% of, of, of murders in New York  City were, were, uh, solved.  Now, counterintuitively, it's down to about 49% solved with all the new DNA and all the new stuff. 
[02:37:00]  And part, and that's around the country and part of the problem from around the country that  the solve rate for murders has gone down so, so much is because the people doing the autopsies  are hospital pathologists, uh, largely who, uh, do not know about gunshot wounds and stab wounds  as with President Kennedy.  Wow.  And that's still a situation in this country.  They're, they're good, um, uh, pathologists to look into cancer and heart disease and natural disease  that kill 92% of people, but the 8% of people, accident, suicide, homicide, that medical examiners 
[02:37:30]  deal with forensic pathologists, they're, they're probably less than 400 pathologists in the  country compared to 800,000 doctors.  And most of the murders today, 50 murders in the United States today will be done by, uh,  the autopsy will be done by pathologists who are not qualified to do those.  50 murders or 50%?  50 murders.  About 50 murders a day in the United States.  Oh, okay, okay.  I'm sorry.  And, uh, uh, hospital pathologists do the autopsies who are not trained in forensics. 
[02:38:00]  And that's one of the reasons that even with the better forensics we have, the people doing  the autopsies aren't, as with John F. Kennedy.  Was he, uh, shot from the front or the back, do you think?  He was shot twice and only twice from the back.  And, uh, one miss.  The first one misses.  Second one, um, uh, hits, uh, him in the, uh, back and goes into John F. Kennedy.  The, uh, Connelly, Governor Connelly says, he hears a shot and he starts turning around.  That shot, he thinks hit the president, but it missed.  It hit the curb. 
[02:38:30]  When the second shot comes in, he's partially turned to look at what happened.  And that's why that, uh, gunshot wound is thought to be curves around.  Oh, because he's turned around a little bit.  He's turned into a straight line, uh, through his back into his left thigh.  And they're assuming he's sitting there straight, but he's not.  Which he wasn't, and then the third, and he might have survived that one, but the third  shot, um, is, uh, the one that kills him.  That's in the line of fire with, uh, oh yeah, yeah, movie about that. 
[02:39:00]  Well, also about the, uh, the, I know the House Select Commission, Commission on Assassination  in 78, they, they actually said that they're, I guess through acoustics, they did acoustic  tests.  They thought that there might have been a fourth bullet and they said that they think there  definitely was, but now they're going back on that.  That's a very good question.  And the reason it's a good question goes back.  Our forensic pathology panel concluded two and only two shots from behind from where  Oswald was, but there are other experts just like in every trial, just like with OJ and 
[02:39:30]  the experts in the acoustical trial said there was a fourth shot, which I, which there's no  evidence from the autopsy.  So they concluded that it was a conspiracy because the fourth shot would have been too  close to the third shot to have to reload.  It was like a second apart.  Wasn't it a, uh, they said it was a policeman's motorcycle audio that had been left on and  now, but then they said later, maybe it was the wrong mic that they had thought.  So what they were hearing was actually a noise from somewhere else and not part of the 
[02:40:00]  assassination.  Yeah, that's right.  And the policeman whose car it was, whose motorcycle it was with the mic that presumed  was open that they heard the fourth shot on, he, he denied that it was his, that it was  his radio that was on.  He just has consistently denied it.  And, um, I think that the noise I've listened to that, uh, just a lot of static, you guys  would probably have heard it because there was a nice little professor from Queens college  who said it was a fourth shot, but there's no evidence, no other evidence, no evidence 
[02:40:30]  in the body, no evidence.  So you have no doubt Oswald did this, huh?  That's correct.  No, no question.  His fingerprints, his handprint is on the weapon.  He purchased the weapon under a false name.  No, no, and the trajectory lines up to where, uh, the, um, if you assume that, uh, Connelly  is sitting, turning slightly to, to look at, of course he was a hunter and he heard the  first shot and he recognized it as a shot, which didn't hit anybody except you can see  on one of the Zapruder films where it struck the curb. 
[02:41:00]  And then the second shot hits the president and Connelly.  And there was also JFK too.  It's funny.  It was, was on a seat that was raised a little bit and it was more towards the middle where  all the old diagrams, like they showed Connelly facing forward Kennedy, but Kennedy was to  Connelly's left, I believe a little bit.  So the trajectory does line up a little bit better.  Yeah.  And he was, he was, they said that he was kind of, uh, slumped down, which is why the  suit jacket was raised.  All these things that the conspiracy are not.  The, the thing about it is that, uh, the Connelly was on a jump seat in front. 
[02:41:30]  So it was lower down and to the left, a little bit to the, to the left of, uh, Kennedy sitting  behind him, you know, jumped and that, if you take it all into account, it's clear, uh, and  we concluded, uh, almost unanimously, uh, that, um, uh, that bullet, that the second bullet  that, um, Oswald shot struck Kennedy in the back, went through his chest, uh, went through 
[02:42:00]  his neck, sorry, and into, and to Connelly's chest and into his thigh.  Wow.  That's the so-called magic bullet.  The whole, uh, autopsy thing, uh, where it was so, you know, uh, dirty and, uh, it seemed  like it wasn't, uh, well, like, was that just business as usual back then or?  Yes, that was business as usual.  Wow.  Except it was in one thing.  And this is, uh, one of the things that hospital, when hospital pathologists do work  and do autopsy and people die of cancer and heart disease and people evaporate upon, they'll 
[02:42:30]  have the chairman of the surgery department and the residents and interns there to, to  learn from it and to give information about how the, what went wrong in the operation, for  example.  Here, when the president is killed, you can't, when medical examiners do autopsies, you can't  have interested people in the autopsy room.  The autopsy room belongs to the pathologist in charge of doing the autopsy.  And it, what was happening in, in, um, the Kennedy autopsy is that there were admirals  and cabinet members in the autopsy room who shouldn't have been there and giving him 
[02:43:00]  orders.  And we asked him, I interviewed, uh, Dr. Humes, who in Washington, we interviewed him.  I said, had you ever done an autopsy on a gunshot victim before?  No.  Uh, did you tell this to the, to the, uh, people asked you to do the autopsy?  You should get a medical examiner, not a hospital pathologist.  And he said, look, when all these generals and admirals are there, we don't say anything. 
[02:43:30]  Wow.  They tell us to do something.  We do it.  Wasn't he military too, doctor?  Wasn't he military and kind of more subject to orders than somebody else?  Yes.  Yes.  He was a commander.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, and, uh, he was stationed at the hospital and he just so happened, they took the body  illegally from Dallas where they had an excellent forensic pathologist who done hundreds of gunshot  wound and rifle wound, uh, autopsies and brought it up to, uh, illegally to, cause it was at that 
[02:44:00]  time a state crime, uh, to, uh, Washington DC where the doctors who did the autopsy had no  experience doing the, uh, gunshot wound cases.  Why'd they do that?  Did they ever say why they did that?  They say they did it because the secret service felt that this might be a conspiracy and they'll  be after Jackie Kennedy.  They're going to shoot other people.  We had to get the, and there was a confrontation.  The medical examiner in, um, in, um, Dallas said, stood at the, um, emergency room door in  the hospital and said, you can't take the body out of here.  This is a state of Texas, Dallas County case. 
[02:44:30]  It's illegal to move the body and the secret service there.  And they, and they had the Dallas police in the, in the, um, emergency room had a brief  confrontation and there was a concern of some people that they were going to draw guns and  start shooting.  But, uh, even though, uh, there was this objection, the decision was made to overrule the, uh, medical  examiner in Dallas and to move the body down to, uh, Washington, which was a big mistake. 
[02:45:00]  And I think a lot of the, there'd always be, uh, questions, but a lot of the questions,  uh, that have risen about, uh, autopsy, uh, uh, misfindings, because the autopsy report  has a lot of incorrect information, um, would have been avoided if a proper forensic pathologist  had done the autopsy as was present in Dallas.  What about the brain?  They lost his brain.  Is that true?  Yeah.  The brain, see, one of the things that medical examiners have to do is look at the brain,  do a gunshot wound to the brain. 
[02:45:30]  So instead of examining the brain right away, Dr. Humes put it in formaldehyde to test it,  to examine it, you know, a few weeks after it was hardened and then it disappeared.  Wow.  In my further investigations later on, it sounded, what I was able to include was, of course,  we interviewed lots, lots of people about where's the brain, you know?  Um, and, um, uh, we were able to determine, uh, and we interviewed the, the, um, uh, gravediggers 
[02:46:00]  that anybody come in, put the brain in.  It's like old Catholic and old Jewish tradition is when the body's buried, it should be, all  the pieces should be put in so God can fix it.  Uh, and, um, what happened here is the, the, um, gravedigger said nobody ever came, but then  we found out that there was a midnight vigil when the body was removed from the temporary,  uh, grave to the eternal light where it is now.  It is now around midnight where a number of people, including Bobby Kennedy came, no gravediggers 
[02:46:30]  were there and he put the material into the cast near the, next to the casket.  And that's where the brain probably is next to the casket in, uh, Arlington cemetery.  And wait, so they would never allow the body to be exhumed, right?  Is that what it was?  Well, that would have been an issue.  You see, we considered that.  And I had to discuss, uh, with other people there, whether we should ask for the body to  be exhumed, which the family wouldn't have, uh, wanted.  They, they made it clear they didn't want, uh, uh, exhumation. 
[02:47:00]  And there was an issue.  What if we want, thought it was necessary, they go to court.  And we decided independently that, look, um, if the family doesn't want it, and since we  have all the information we need to explain the bullet trajectories and the cause of death,  that we shouldn't press for it.  And we didn't press for an exhumation.  Should see if the, uh, Eric Nagel brain is, uh, also deep in that grave.  One of our employees.  Yes.  He's hoping you could do an autopsy.  I don't know what we're getting at. 
[02:47:30]  He's been a fan.  He just has a stem.  It's amazing.  There's nothing after the stem and he still functions and walks around.  We think it's all motor reflexes.  As they say, they think that lawyers work like that too.  Why don't we, uh,  Dr. Quincy, douchebag.  Oh no, Quincy, Quincy was very good.  Uh, except what Quincy shows what the, what the problems are with CSI and all that is  that, um, you can't just let a case develop normally cause it's too boring.  You got to have the CSI person do the DNA in three minutes or else you don't have a show 
[02:48:00]  and that show.  Yeah.  So, uh, there's a lot of information giving these programs that isn't quite true.  Like Quincy.  Well, Quincy, it seemed Quincy was always out there and, and people were shooting.  Are you going to get Quincy sometimes?  Yeah.  That, that, that, that's the kind that doesn't happen.  With Quincy and the CSI, the one person does everything.  Yeah.  He does the autopsy, he goes to the scene, he interviews people, all which doesn't happen.  A young girl was murdered, doctor.  I disagree.  You sit around, I go out and find who did it. 
[02:48:30]  Do you want to hold Quincy impression?  Yeah.  Very good.  Very good.  Very, very good.  But the thing about it is, I think the public, this is the problem I have with Quincy and  other shows.  Yeah.  The public, um, um, realizes at some level that this is all video, uh, license, you  know, that they're allowed to do things that aren't real.  One person doesn't do six different jobs in real life.  They realize that what they don't realize is that all cases don't get solved.  The, the, the thing about OJ Simpson, how come only OJ Simpson, uh, uh, you know, he's 
[02:49:00]  only a high profile case in Hollywood don't get solved.  Uh, more than half the murders in the United States don't get solved.  See, uh, more, I, I don't think anybody's studies, 40, 30% of people who commit murders  wind up getting convicted.  Well, in LA it's probably gonna be 10% with their horrendous prosecution.  Did they, did they blow the Menendez, they blew, they blew OJ, they blew a lot of big  cases, right?  Well, maybe if they were doing the case. 
[02:49:30]  They don't, they don't, uh, not everybody gets convicted.  Look at Louisiana in New Orleans where they got, what, a 2% uh, uh, uh, solve rate for  murders, you know, since Katrina.  2%?  Yeah, they're less than 2%.  I think there's one murder conviction in New Orleans, partly, I think because they're  very weak.  Sweeping up.  A very weak district attorney's office.  Oh, how he's got it, how, how, how did he catch the one guy, how bad was the one guy  who got caught, what did he do, like, in the judge's chair?  Confessing. 
[02:50:00]  Let's take a quick break and continue.  Okay.  We'll get into, uh, John Belushi's death and some other things, and, uh.  Sure.  What are you promoting today?  We don't even know.  I don't know.  I think it started out with, with, no, no, I think it started out with, uh, Jessica Manzi  called about some, uh, people can get the, uh, DVD, get discs on the, uh.  The autopsy series.  Autopsy series.  Autopsy series or see, uh, what do you call it, uh, HBO?  What do you call it?  On demand?  HBO On Demand and all.  They are still on demand. 
[02:50:30]  One popped up recently, I think the fifth one or something, and I actually have, there's  two books Dr. Bond has written.  I had someone run out and grab me one, so I can get it signed.  That would be good, yeah.  Called Unnatural Death.  It's in paperback, um, and there's also another one, uh, I don't have the name in  front of me, but, uh, oh, it's called, uh, Dead Reckoning.  Yeah.  The New Science of Catching Killers.  And these are really, like, it's amazingly interesting stuff.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  We're gonna, we're gonna continue.  Yeah.  I want to ask you about the death fields.  Have you, uh, checked those things out?  Where they have the people laying around?  Body farms.  Body farms.  Yeah, body farms. 
[02:51:00]  Have you walked around body farms?  Yeah.  Oh, I gotta ask you a few questions.  He has one in his house.  He paints tomatoes.  Body farms, yes.  All right.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Dr. Michael Bodden in studio, the, the famous, uh, pathologist.  And, uh, I want to ask, uh, what made you want to go into this field?  Most people wouldn't.  It, it, just by accident, because, uh, since birth, my mother had wanted me to be a doctor. 
[02:51:30]  And I wound up, uh, going to City College, New York, and NYU Medical School.  And just, but, to be a real doctor to treat living people, you know, um, and when I got  to NYU Medical School, at that time, the autopsy room was at Bellevue Hospital together with the  medical examiner's office.  So when I went down to look at, uh, organs from dead people, um, there were the medical  examiners in the corner with all the interesting cases. 
[02:52:00]  And I just got interested by chance because the, the medical examiner's office in the  Bellevue Pathology Department, uh, share the same autopsy room.  Were you creeped out by the first dead body you saw?  Oh yeah.  I was creeped out.  It's interesting.  I was creeped out for a couple of reasons.  One, the odor of death.  And two, that some of the medical examiners were drinking coffee and eating sandwiches.  I was going to ask you about that.  And smoking.  They'd smoke while they're doing the autopsy in those days.  Just chatting.  I was somebody who died of lung cancer, you know. 
[02:52:30]  Smoking a cigarette.  And they'd drink coffee.  And I said, that's horrible.  And that really creeped me out.  But after about a week of going to the autopsy room, no more odors because I guess it, uh,  it knocked out all of my smell, uh, things.  And I started drinking coffee in the autopsy room.  I, I got a, I got an idea.  Are you, are you a fun guy?  You like to have a little fun?  Well, uh, as long as we don't get sued for it.  Well, we have a guy that has horrific breath.  And I'm just wondering if, uh.  If it's worse than death?  If it's worse, worse than death. 
[02:53:00]  Right.  Well, there's a, the autopsy room has a very unique kind of smell because you're smelling  gases coming out of the intestines of people who are being autopsied.  Plus, there's a background of formaldehyde because you use formaldehyde in the autopsy  room to put organ tissues to look at them under the microscope.  So this is a very unusual kind of smell.  It's a little different than just the odor of a dead body in the trunk of a car.  Like walking by, right, right.  Some dead animal on the side of the street or something. 
[02:53:30]  Some dead human pretty much smells similar.  Yeah, that smell is, uh, ugh.  Should we bring an E-Rock?  I really want to do this.  I kind of want to.  I can't believe it's worse than death.  He's in a bad mood today, though.  Do you put anything under your nose?  Like, uh.  Like Silence of the Lambs with Vicks Vaporub?  No, it's the most amazing thing.  Up until Silence of the Lambs, nobody used Vicks Vaporub except occasional policemen.  But then when, uh, Jodie Foster used it under her nose, it was life-imitating art, you know? 
[02:54:00]  Oh, everyone started doing it.  Everybody uses now Vicks.  I think the Vicks Vaporub is a more horrific smell than the natural smells of a dead body.  Thank you, Jeff.  I've been feeling he gets in there and gives a nice...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm at work.  That's natural smells.  And what about the, uh, the, uh, gallows humor that you see sometimes in movies and stuff?  Do the guys around, sometimes you've got a case that isn't particularly, you know, I don't know. 
[02:54:30]  It's awful, but some people, you do feel a little more sympathetic than others, and maybe you joke about an injury or such.  That's the problem with when, when cases get videoed and sound is on.  Ah.  Sometimes one does, um, uh, second autopsies for, for, uh, murder cases.  And the defense wants their own video, and they have a second, um, uh, autopsy done, and they have the sound on, and you can hear things in the background. 
[02:55:00]  Uh-huh.  And there is sometimes to relieve the tension.  Sure.  People tell jokes and things, and I don't like that at all when I'm doing an autopsy because it can be misinterpreted as disrespect for the body, which it really isn't, of the dead person.  Uh, but the classic, um, um, uh, gallows humor that I, when I came in, uh, there was an old, uh, very distinguished, uh, first chief medical examiner in New York City, uh, NARS, and he was professorial and huge, and he was dictating a case to, to, um, a, um, uh, stenographer. 
[02:55:30]  That was before, uh, uh, what do you call it, uh, the laptops and stuff like that.  This is back in the 30s, the 20s.  And at the end of the dictation, the stenographer says, hey, you didn't mention anything about his penis.  I said, well, what about it?  Well, the penis, you know, goes all the way over his leg down to the table.  Uh, isn't that unusual?  And, uh, the stenographer, uh, the stenographer, uh, says, uh, you didn't mention that. 
[02:56:00]  And he says, well, why?  I have one like that.  And he, the stenographer says, you have one as long?  He says, no, one just as dead.  Yeah, that's, that's the kind of, uh, gallows, uh, humor that, uh, is, uh, not meant to be disrespectful.  Right, right.  Body farms.  I read a book called, uh, Stiff that was amazing.  Yes, by Marion Roach.  It was a book about, uh, the dead and what they do with, uh, the bodies and how they, they test them for all sorts of things. 
[02:56:30]  And how useful bodies can be after death and helping the community and helping train doctors.  They actually try out cosmetics on, uh, dead people and stuff like that.  Cosmetics, and they have different, uh, surgeons, ENT, head surgeons and neurosurgeons and abdominal practice on dead bodies or do anatomy and do dissections.  And it's wonderful with permission from the next of kin.  They put them in car crashes?  Yes, that, uh, the Pope doesn't like that.  Even with permission, the Pope came out with, where they run cars into bodies with permission that are hanging down from the ceiling. 
[02:57:00]  Who the hell has that job?  Wow.  In, uh, in, uh, I had a friend right down in Baltimore.  The medical examiner there would shoot dead bodies and, uh, and run into dead bodies.  And then write the papers, publish the, the research so that the car companies could learn from it.  And the people who made, um, uh, vest, bulletproof vests can learn from which bullets really go through and which don't. 
[02:57:30]  And a lot can be useful, but it has to be done very carefully with permission of, uh, the next of kin.  Yeah.  And the Pope doesn't like this.  Why would he?  Yeah, the, the, I remember at the time, uh, a few years ago, the Pope came out and said that, uh, even with permission, you're not allowed to run into dead bodies.  They can't run into.  They were doing a lot of that in Germany.  The German pathologist.  Well, of course they were.  But the best.  Those guys.  Only a certain group, I'm sure.  The best part of the book was, uh, how they were describing these body farms.  Yeah.  And one of the things that, uh, that's the gold standard, the golden, um, um, that, that, uh, people that medical examiners are looking for is how do you tell time of death? 
[02:58:00]  How do, how do you know when somebody's died?  Uh, and one of the ways that's been worked on is in the body farm is to see what happens to the body after death, how long it takes to decompose.  Can you tell from the maggots and flies that come into the body, how long they've been dead?  And they've been doing a lot of research.  Dr. Bass was the founder of this down in, um, uh, Tennessee, University of Tennessee Anthropology, uh, uh, school. 
[02:58:30]  And, uh, they've learned a lot about, um, uh, how bodies go from ashes to ashes, dust to dust.  This is God's way of recycling a body.  Uh, a lot of it with bacteria and with, um, maggots and insects that, um, break the body down.  But they put these, uh, bodies in all sorts of scenarios in this body, uh, farms.  Like, uh, I don't know, stuffed in a trunk or a drowning victim or shallow graves and they study how the body does in these situations. 
[02:59:00]  And how long it takes to decompose.  So if you find a body, you can tell you're dead for three months or three years.  Right.  And the problem with that, though, is that how fast the body decomposes is so temperature and climate dependent.  It's all dependent.  The higher the temperature, the faster it breaks down.  And what good, what works in Tennessee doesn't necessarily work in New York or in Alaska.  So that there is, uh, the, that we're still searching for the holy grail of how to tell how long somebody's been dead. 
[02:59:30]  Do you find, uh, like, uh, you look at where the mummies were done.  It's pretty impressive the way the Egyptians took care of the dead, right?  Yes.  It's, it's very impressive.  And it's even more impressive how God takes care of the dead.  Remember the 5,000 year old body that was found in the Austrian Alps?  It was in excellent condition because cold, freezing prevents the bacteria from starting.  When we die, the first things that happen to, uh, start breaking this down is the, all of the bacteria in our intestines start spreading through the body. 
[03:00:00]  And the bacteria eat up things and create gases.  And if it's below, um, uh, 33 degrees or 34 degrees Fahrenheit, the bacteria can't work.  And bodies will stay, uh, like mammoths and will, will stay forever in ice.  What about, um, oh God, what, what is, how do flies know?  They smell things. 
[03:00:30]  They smell the dead.  But do flies know?  You're right.  And in fact, when somebody's unconscious, the flies will start coming in even before the body, the person is dead.  If unconscious, we'll see bodies, uh, in hospitals where the person just dies by the time they're down into the, uh, more in their refrigerator.  Uh, flies.  It's amazing during season how many pregnant flies there are.  They'll run around and they'll lay their eggs in any kind of moist surface.  But where do they come from all of a sudden? 
[03:01:00]  Well, Louis Pasteur, I think, found out that flies come from other flies and not from the, not from the ethos.  And what happens is that, uh, during summer, during spring, uh, there are lots and lots of, uh, pregnant flies that have these maggot eggs in them.  And they'll go wherever they can smell that there's a moisture.  And usually in the nostrils and the nose is the first place.  Or in, in holes in the body, like bullet holes and stab wounds, they'll lay their eggs there. 
[03:01:30]  And we have to be very careful about the distortion that can cause.  Ah, yeah.  How about not sleeping people?  Like, if you're drunk and passed out, will a fly actually crawl on your nose and lay eggs and, you know, maggots?  Not usually.  How does that not happen?  I've had, I've had cockroaches in, in the Bronx when babies and alcoholics who fall down have, uh, crawl into the ear or crawl into the nostril and really cause a lot of pain.  But cockroaches don't eat.  They don't bite.  People don't know that.  Cockroaches don't bite and they don't remove tissue. 
[03:02:00]  But they can cause a lot of pain in the ear by scratching the eardrum.  Oh, my God.  That's, that's pretty nasty stuff.  How do you get one of those out?  You just gotta go in with a couple of tweezers?  You know, you, well, you actually, you put water in and you irrigate the, uh, with a little plunger and you wash it out.  You wash the cockroach out.  It comes out like it's on a water slide.  Yeah.  She's laughing, smiley.  Did you do, uh, Belushi's autopsy?  Um, I didn't do the autopsy, but I reviewed it and I testified in the grand jury and the trial. 
[03:02:30]  No, I saw the photographs.  He was in, uh, LA, right?  Uh, yeah.  He died in, uh, in the Maramont Hotel in Los Angeles.  And it turned out with a lot of heroin and, um, cocaine in his body.  And they, the district prosecutor called me to come in the case because I'd written a lot of papers about heroin and cocaine from New York City.  And it looked like he had been on a cocaine high and the heroin was given by the girlfriend, uh, not the girlfriend, but the gal who, whom he paid to make the injections, um, uh, in order to bring him down from the high. 
[03:03:00]  It wasn't really a cannonball, you know, kind of, it was the heroin used to, to counteract the cocaine.  That's what killed him.  And, um, I had an interview with his doctors and all that.  He hated needles.  And, um, uh, that's why he hired a person to inject the cocaine.  And, um, uh, there were a number of, um, uh, people there, De Niro and, um, Robin Williams were with him the night before. 
[03:03:30]  And, uh, they, uh, testified, the grand jury, at the same time I testified, that, um, he didn't like, um, uh, needles.  That's why he paid Catherine Smith, I think it was, to do the injections.  And she was the one who was brought up on the charges that even though he asked her to do it, that's not an excuse.  Was she convicted?  Yeah.  She, she had gone to Canada and I had to testify, send testimony to Canada, get her extradited back to, to Los Angeles. 
[03:04:00]  And then she was convicted and she had to spend, uh, a manslaughter or something.  And she spent about 10 years in jail or something.  She did 10 years for that?  I'm not sure.  She may have gotten 10 years and spent five years.  Wow.  But she's back in Canada as I, last I heard.  What was, uh, your greatest case?  Well, I think the, the one that was most important to me was the, uh, John F. Kennedy case.  And I think we got it all right.  Cause it's still a controversy after 15. 
[03:04:30]  Oh yeah.  Always.  Yeah.  All right.  You autopsy, interesting.  One of the, uh, one of the, with the flight 800, TWA flight 800.  Yeah.  It's everybody's nightmare.  Um, because, you know, I, I, correct me if I'm wrong about any of this.  The, the plane, it goes up 13,000 feet.  Explosion blows off the cockpit.  Oh yeah.  And the, uh, plane continued to ascend for, I think another 3,000 or 4,000 feet.  Some of that, yeah.  Uh, cause the wing engines, uh, were unaffected.  Yeah.  And the weight difference.  Now you tip the nose up because the cockpit's gone. 
[03:05:00]  And they were alive.  When they hit the ground.  When they hit the water, yeah.  Oh, I, I don't remember where I heard that.  Obviously I'm going to guess it was some kind of an impact death, but wasn't it drowning?  Or did they say that they, technically drowning?  Um, yeah, the, the, the problem is when you hit water like that, it's like hitting concrete  really.  And they had a lot of injuries, although a few people had inhaled water, which would make  it drowning, but they probably weren't conscious and had severe injuries at the time.  Uh, so even once we're dead, brain dead, we can still be breathing, uh, for a little bit. 
[03:05:30]  Uh, and when you inhale water, that's technically drowning, but I, the question about the cases  that have me the biggest concern, the two groups of cases that is, one is when I get  involved with people who I think are really innocent, they're innocent people that get  convicted on bad medical examiner work.  Those are the cases that are most disturbing because people are in jail for 15, 20 years  and you find out that it wasn't a murder at all, that they made a mistake and the eyewitnesses 
[03:06:00]  were wrong and stuff like that.  And they get out and the prosecutor says, well, it shows you the system works because  the guy gets out after 15 years.  Well, and the, the other case that's most difficult for medical examiners around the country, deaths  during police restraint, they're the ones that are hardest because invariably there are people  saying that, uh, he died because he had, uh, he got too excited and he died.  And the, and the, um, uh, friends who are the, uh, uh, the witnesses from, uh, the non-police 
[03:06:30]  witnesses say, no, he was saying, I can't breathe, I can't breathe, but they still were  sitting on him and he couldn't breathe and he died of not breathing.  Those are the cases that become the most difficult and I think the most important for us to solve  correctly because, uh, once we start trying to, uh, make sure the police don't get blamed  as often happens is we're really becoming partial rather than impartial, uh, scientists.  Where's, where, was there, just to go back to flight 800 for a minute, were there any 
[03:07:00]  people, uh, that had burn, uh, injuries on them that would have been sustained before  they died from, from being in a place with an open, the open wound to the front of the  plane?  Yeah, they, a lot, it was very confusing at first when I went up to see, there were about  230 people on the flight, including everybody, all who died, of whom died.  The first 100 were floating, the other 130 were, were not, and it was exact number 100 came out 
[03:07:30]  and they had a lot of skull burns on their body, which was very puzzling at first, but later turned  out to be because they'd been lying in the jet fuel. They had the full, uh, jet, uh, fuel tanks.  Yeah.  And the jet fuel is very irritating to the skin, even after death. So there were a lot  of burns on the exposed portion of the bodies, not on the clothed portions, but they all happened  after the death while they were floating before they were brought in, uh, to, to the morgue. 
[03:08:00]  Did any of them live, I don't know, this is, maybe there's no way to tell, but maybe you  know something about what happens to the body. Did any of them live all the way down or, or  will your brain, uh, because of the pressure not work?  No, no. When somebody's falling out down, uh, you, you, you, you don't lose consciousness.  Usually people jump off the Empire State Building, uh, they get in trouble when they land.  They're, they're still conscious. Uh, here, uh, we had evidence of some people breathing in  water and, um, and, uh, bleeding into their lungs and all, which would indicate, in my opinion, 
[03:08:30]  there was some dispute about this in the, uh, um, insurance claims, because in the  civil litigation, the longer somebody's alive, theoretically, the more money, uh, the family  should get. But the, the important thing is not living, it's consciousness. So I think  that after the explosion, there were, most of the, um, um, uh, people who died lived long  enough to get into the water and then breathed a bit and, uh, had injuries, internal bleeding 
[03:09:00]  to indicate they were still alive and the heart was pumping. But it's a bigger issue to say  how long were they conscious. My experience with people who have fallen and survive, uh,  you know, in stories that they tell afterwards who, uh, jumped out a building and then survived  is that, yeah, they knew when they were hitting the ground. So I think that most, that many  of them would have been conscious and you'd have that much conscious pain and suffering  a few seconds, which would mean a lot, uh, in a civil action. But falling 13,000 feet, 
[03:09:30]  I just wasn't sure if the cabin pressure, I mean, I was always kidding. Cabin pressure  was gone because of the pole. I just wanted to, if that type of fall, but I guess people  skydive, people skydive and fall longer than that. It's not like they're 35, yeah. Yeah.  And, and also the skydivers know the interesting about falling objects, uh, bodies, even with  the astronauts who fell, you know, hundreds of thousands feet, uh, miles up, um, the terminal  velocity only goes to about 120 miles, uh, an hour on impact because of the atmosphere  that prevents that whole thing up. And that's why in the astronaut deaths, the, uh, the bodies 
[03:10:00]  were in good enough condition to identify all the astronauts. They don't, they don't, uh,  smash into smithereens as was said in the World Trade Center. You know, 40% of the World Trade  Center bodies were never identified partly because no autopsies were done on those that remained.  But the excuse given was that they smashed into smithereens or something. Bodies don't  smash into smithereens. They say, remark, the skin stays intact, even though there's 
[03:10:30]  a lot of, uh, internal. Yeah. Your guts may shoot out your ass in your mouth, right? But  I mean, uh, they said that's what happens if you jump naked. Somebody jumped naked, I  think, on the Empire State Building. It was like a real passive aggressive thing. Like  I jumped nude and then it's just to get his body to fucking, all the guts and blood to  block. That can happen. Jeez. How do you know these things? I just, I masturbate a lot.  Jimmy's a morbid, morbid guy. You know, if you take this and give this the FBI behavioral  unit, I think they may think we have a serial killer. They're not the only ones. He studies 
[03:11:00]  serial killers. But no, I read about stuff like this. I say he studies it myself, but he  says he reads about it. It's a little hobby, but he knows more about serial killers than  anyone in a life. Oh yeah, he knows all their names and everything. Yeah, it's unbelievable.  But yeah, it was interesting to, uh, see, I was under the illusion that those flighted 100 people  had probably passed out before hitting the ground, but in term of a life, he's turned  a lot. It's amazing the, the, how the body stays intact. And, uh, in my, because nobody's  ever done a study on this, you know, uh, having a person talking to a microphone while he's 
[03:11:30]  falling down. But, uh, I think the evidence is that, uh, most people falling from heights,  uh, such as the Empire State Building and even airplanes are a lot, are still conscious when  they hit the ground. Even at Pan Am and that explosion over Lockerbie, which is a full 30  something thousand feet when they, they dropped, right? Yeah. There was another, there was one  about 10,000. When I first started out as a medical student with two airplanes crashed  over, um, Brooklyn and, uh, a kid survived who fell into a snow bank. It was during the winter 
[03:12:00]  and he was able to remember things that happened on the way down, but then he died. Oh, wow.  It was about 10,000 feet up. He survived for a few weeks, but then he died. He had enough  injuries. What's, uh, the baby mummification case about? Someone wants us to ask you about  baby mummification. Ask about the baby mummification case. No, I'm not quite clear that although babies,  uh, can mummify after they're dead. We've had some situations where babies, the parents don't 
[03:12:30]  tell anybody the baby died. And over time in war, in, in, uh, warm climates, what's  interesting on the desert. And then when we die there, the bacteria for the gut starts  going into decompose the body and bloated up. But also there's a drying out in hot, uh, hot  climate. So if the drying is faster than the ability of the, of the bacteria develop, the 
[03:13:00]  bacteria need water to, to develop fluid. If they dry out very quickly, the body has a leather,  a leathery mummification and can stay for hundreds of years in that condition. Wow.  Yeah. They just recently found like, I think the hand of a passenger from a plane that crashed in  the thirties and they were able to identify this guy by fingerprints and DNA. Yeah. It's amazing.  Now they were able to develop some fingerprints from, um, it was a, a, a merchant Marine in an 
[03:13:30]  airplane and a crash in a mountain in Canada. And it was, uh, because it was in this cold  after 60, 70 years, they're still able to get a fingerprint, get a fingerprint off his  hand. It's the most amazing thing. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. It was something. Just read that one.  All right. Uh, let's say hi to Brian in Kentucky. Brian.  Oh, Hey, I'm pretty raw. I hope I don't get cut off. I wonder what the doctor thinks of that 
[03:14:00]  cryogenics. Is that just bullshit or is that a legitimate science or what's his opinion?  Uh, it's bullshit, but it, but it's interesting. And you, it is interesting. Kentucky has a great  medical examiner system in different States that half the United States is still the old  coroner system, which we inherited from England in colonial days in which any citizen can get  elected, uh, coroner as long as he's a voting age. Kentucky has a very excellent medical examiner 
[03:14:30]  system. Uh, it's interesting also that the coroners in the United States are entirely different  than coroners in England and Canada because they upgraded the coroners. So coroners today have  to be doctors or lawyers or very well trained in England and Canada and Australia, but United  States, coroners still are the way they were in the, uh, eight, uh, what is it? Uh, 1660s. 
[03:15:00]  So you can just, a bunch of UPS drivers opening up bodies.  Yeah. Just become one. What does, what does he do over there with the eyebrows?  He's a coroner. Uh, we have Peter Dean has been visiting me. He's a coroner in England. Is he famous  or something? He's famous. He goes to Africa and he finds out where English people have been killed  in Africa and they cover it up. It was in Kenya. Really? In Kenya. Absolutely fascinating. Yeah. It's  been really interesting actually listening to the discussion and particularly when you're talking 
[03:15:30]  about airplane incidents as well. I mean, certainly after Lockerbie, that was one of the big issues  as to whether people were alive for the fall itself. And what they actually looked at was  little things called fat emboli in the bodies when they were recovered and found that maybe 70%  of them had these little fat emboli, which suggested that they still had active circulations  and therefore were still alive during the fall itself. Yeah. That's interesting. As Peter says,  because our bones have fat in the bone marrow. And if you're alive and the bones break, 
[03:16:00]  some of that fat gets into the bloodstream and the heart has to be pumping to get, to get pumped  around. So that's good evidence that they were alive. It still doesn't tell you if they were  conscious, but tells you they were alive. So you now, why are people being murdered in Kenya from  Britain? What happens is with the system that we have in the United Kingdom, if a body comes back  from abroad to your jurisdiction, if it was an unnatural death, you still have to investigate that 
[03:16:30]  death. So English coroners get involved, therefore, in investigating deaths that actually happened  abroad. As long as the body comes back to your area, you still have responsibility for  investigating the circumstances. How are they being killed? A variety of means, really. Not all  criminal cases. A lot of them may be unnatural death for other reasons, accidents abroad. Like Diana and  Dodie. Indeed. Yeah. They were killed in, they died in Paris in an auto accident, yet the coroners in  England did autopsies. Yeah. And you get to see those bodies? No, I was not involved in that. Hey, 
[03:17:00]  don't look at me. He's like, he's saying like, hey, hey. Absolutely. No, it's interesting to watch the  whole thing develop. But again, it's an example of just how if the body is killed in some incident  abroad, criminal or otherwise, it still becomes the subject of an English coroner's inquest if  everybody comes back. Well, you two guys just like coroners hang out together? Is that what  you guys do and just talk about dead people? We actually do. We learn about it. I learn about 
[03:17:30]  how people die in England from Peter and he learns about deaths in New York by just walking the  streets of New York City. It's fascinating when you come to things like the American Academy of  Forensic Sciences, the range of expertise you guys have over here. That's where you go to the same kind of  conferences and for forensic scientists from around the world. Peter, could you say wasabi,  please? Wasabi. You said you're going back on the Queen Mary 2 to give a seminar? What kind of fun 
[03:18:00]  cruise is this? They always have a range of lecturers on board. They have general interest lectures.  Sometimes there'll be lectures themed to destinations. Now this one's a transatlantic cruise and they  have different lecturers on board. So I'm just going to be talking about kind of legal history  of America. I don't know. I kind of like rum drinks and feeling hot, hot, hot. Listening to 
[03:18:30]  cases for all tastes. I mean, Peter once gave a lecture on the Titanic and then they forbid him to do  that. Yeah. And no more, no more cruises for you. Hey, you want to play shuffleboard or go listen to  the coroner talk about patriotic cancer? It's a little unusual. The first time I did one,  they had a British comedian on board, in fact. And he said, uh, first night he's doing a show in  one of the areas and he was so bad. They mixed you two up. He's going down the list of people on  board and says, Hey, it says they've got a coroner on board. Must be a Miss British. It must be a  crooner. So for the rest of the crews, they just thought there was some crooner on board. You're 
[03:19:00]  the crooner. But it's interesting to have different lectures. You know, Michael and I,  I think we did a, there's a Halloween murder mystery crossing. And Queen Elizabeth. It was  very fascinating. They themed the whole thing. They take it a little far though and actually do  an autopsy on a poor person. These two would be a ball at a keg party. I was just going to say,  you guys are either really fun or you have the worst parties. It's a bunch of people with black  coffee and black balloons and the shades are all drawn. They're just maniacs and they 
[03:19:30]  let loose and have a good time. What do you talk about? Like you're a married guy. We say  keep drinking and smoking cause it's good for business. What do you talk about in like in  your personal life? I can't picture Dr. Bond and his wife just discussing music or what  do you want to eat? My wife is a former prosecutor in New Jersey and, um, and now does, uh, civil  work. Uh, and we, we talk, we're writing books now about, um, uh, now we have a  series going now. The first one was, uh, remain silent. The next coming out in January, skeleton 
[03:20:00]  justice about, uh, a male medical examiner, a female prosecutor and how they get into twangled  with intertangled with each other and have disputes and non-disputes that married yet. Eventually  I think in book four, they'll get married a little passive aggressive things about the  relationship kind of coming out. Oh, absolutely. It's, it's, it's, it's, I hadn't appreciated  how possessive my wife was of her words. I'll change words and she'll get very angry with 
[03:20:30]  it. And that's brought out. It's amazing. We're still married. Like, do you, how do you  change the words? Do you, do you make it better? Or does she think that you're dumbing it down?  Like she'll write something really eloquent and you'll just kind of put like, the man fell.  Well, I think it's just the opposite. I try to put into Shakespeare. I put into iambic  pentameter, punch it up. And try and, you know, make it more literary. And, uh, she may  think that misses the point. Does she yell at you? Yeah. Yeah. From time to time. Like 
[03:21:00]  a prosecutor. She doesn't yell at me when Peter's around. She's very good when companies  around. But if she wants to ask questions about that, like, will she sit you down? Like,  you know, you're in trouble when she'll start like, Michael, uh, and then you start kind  of going over. She starts saying, what about this hair that was, uh, on your shirt? Let's  discuss a hair and how much evidence it potentially has. Oh, that's gotta be great. You can do  everything about science. You can probably just cheat and explain everything away. Let 
[03:21:30]  me tell you something that, which I have learned a good cross examiner can do very well. No  matter if even she doesn't know anything about science, she knows the kind of questions  to ask. Trip you up. Cross examination is, is a, um, is a art as an art in itself. What  about Dennis? Was it Dennis Fung was his name? I think, right? The, uh, Dr. Barry  Sheck, uh, it was very interesting because people remember that with the OJ Simpson, where  Barry Sheck was able to have the criminalist Dennis Fung, uh, who worked for the Los Angeles 
[03:22:00]  Crime Department, admit, understand that he had made some mistakes in his analysis, uh, and  in his, uh, protection of the evidence. But I thought the most, the most, uh, spectacular  thing was Peter Neufeld, who works with him, cross-examining those boring kind of thing,  the, the statistician, PhD statistician, world renowned, and going over his evidence and getting  the statistician on the stand to say, yes, my, I made a mistake in this statistical, uh, 
[03:22:30]  um, uh, testimony. And then, which I thought, you know, nobody knew there was a mistake there  because, you know, who would know, who the hell knows statistics. But this, this, uh, this,  uh, high regarded, um, uh, PhD professor of statistics saying, you know, you're right.  I didn't think of that, but you're absolutely right. I made a mistake. That blew my mind.  Wow. That's why O.G. walks around. We got to go backwards. He plays golf. He plays golf.  On instant feedback, Stephen S. from Bayshore, he writes, has, uh, has the good doctor ever 
[03:23:00]  told his wife during an argument that she better watch it because he can make it look just like  a heart attack? If, if, if I ever told, if I ever told my wife that I would not be around  but, uh, um, Stephen S. also has one for the English, uh, coroner. He writes, uh, the queen's  not looking well. Is Peter wringing his hands together in joyous expectation over cutting 
[03:23:30]  into that Royal clump? I think the Royal family has wonderful genes since we've gone for a long  time yet. But also there's, uh, one coroner assigned to the Royal family, right? Well, that's really  since Henry VIII time they've had a coroner appointed, uh, as the Royal coroner. She had  a code. My head's gone. Well, Henry VIII decided that there should be a coroner appointed to  prevent malicious bloodshed within the Royal palaces. Ah. I reckon he could look after all 
[03:24:00]  the non-malicious bloodshed himself. I would assume he was probably, you know, at the beck and  call of, uh, whoever's in charge if something was a little fishy. Yeah. I mean, historically  it's interesting to look back on that stuff, the way it all developed. Absolutely. But  you see, yeah, the, the, the thing I would love to do is they didn't have a Royal obstetrician  who made sure the baby came from the right person. Ah. One of the, the, the two, the two  things that I would love to do in my, is one to exhume William Shakespeare and do certain  things there, which are interesting. And the second thing is to do DNA on all the kings 
[03:24:30]  and queens in, uh, where are they buried all in, uh, Westminster Abbey and do DNA to see  who really belongs and who doesn't belong in the, in the lineage. Boy, would that shake  things up. Yeah. I bet there's a couple of gaps in there. I would imagine so. What would  you like to do in Shakespeare? What would you like to find out? Shakespeare, what's interesting  in Shakespeare, he died around 1620. And, um, in those days when you died, people who 
[03:25:00]  gave eulogies like Ben Johnson and other giants of the, would give the eulogy and then have  it written on rag paper. Rag paper stays much longer than, than, uh, wood paper. And they  put it into the casket. And it would be wonderful to see if any of these eulogies are still intact  because the body is buried inside, um, the, um, uh, the church in, uh, Stratford on, uh, 
[03:25:30]  Stratford. Yeah. And, um, that, though, whatever's in that casket might still be in good, in good  condition. There's a logo, there's a written on the casket, something about, um, anybody who,  uh, who disinteres me, um, um, that, uh, break his bones or something like that. You know,  they were always afraid in those days that, um, people would be disinterred and things robbed  from them. So there's an interesting, uh, uh, four line, uh, allegedly, uh, written by Shakespeare 
[03:26:00]  about people not disturbing his body after death. So you want to get, you want to get the boys  together and do some, uh, grave robbing. Well, grave investigation, grave investigation.  What about, uh, you, you said you did, uh, Billy Martin's death. Yeah. Billy Martin was  interesting because, um, he died after leaving a bar around Christmas time in Binghamton, New  York with a driver and they went off, they skidded off, it was snow and he's, Billy Martin 
[03:26:30]  is dead in the passenger seat and the driver is drunk in the, uh, driver's seat and brought  to the hospital. And it, it always occurs when two people die in a, um, in a, uh, in a car  crash, whether as with Billy Martin or a fire, often there are fires and one lives and one  dies. After talking to a lawyer, the, the guy, the person who's alive remembers that  he wasn't the driver and the issue came up as to who the driver was. And we were, I was 
[03:27:00]  able to investigate the car and go over things and the hair in the, in the, um, in the driver's  side, um, uh, which belonged to, didn't belong to Billy Martin. It belonged to the other  guy. But when I went in to get the hair sample, uh, from this guy who said he was in the passenger  seat, um, I got a court order to get the hair sample. He's in the hospital. He's talked to  his lawyers and he's sure that he was in the passenger seat. And while taking the hair, when  I pulled it out a little bit, his, uh, ill fitting robe sort of separated that it was 
[03:27:30]  in the hospital. And there's this huge impact of the, um, steering column on his chest. And  the problem with that is it doesn't appear in the, in the, in the records because it didn't  break anything. So they didn't have to treat it. They didn't get paid by blue cross for doing  anything. So they don't even mention it. But looking at him, there was the steering wheel  impact against his chest, which clearly showed that he was a driver. Yeah. He went to jail for  that too. Pardon me? He went to jail. It was, you know, he didn't, he didn't go to jail, but this 
[03:28:00]  was came up really in a civil lawsuit in a civil lawsuit because he was suing, uh, they were suing  each other. Billy Martins, people were suing him. He was suing Billy Martins. I, I don't remember if  he went to jail or not. He may have gone to jail for a little bit. He, there was a criminal trial.  You're right. He did go to jail, but for a short period of time. And what about, uh, it said here,  we, we, Phil Spector's murder trial for the defense. Um, well, I was called in there because 
[03:28:30]  with, which is coming up again, the Phil Spector case is coming up again. And, uh, I'm still on a  gag order, so I can't really talk too much about it. But, um, the issue is the, that, um, the weapon,  there was a gunshot of the mouth that the, the, the gun was inside the mouth and she dies of a gunshot  wound. And one of the things I testified in open court so that is that 99.9% of the time when 
[03:29:00]  there's a gunshot wound in the mouth, it's self-inflicted. You don't kill people by putting  guns in the mouth because they keep their jaws shut. Right. And just the way it works out is  it's self-inflicted. And that, that was part of the testimony was that the issue was whether he held  the gun or she held the gun at the time it went off, whose hand was on, it's like Chicago whose hand  was on the gun, you know, was there a powder burn on her hand at all or powder? It was a lot of  powder in her hands, none on his. Oh, all right. Huh? Yeah. Which is the usual way we tell things.  But in Los Angeles, the prosecutor, there was so much publicity about it. They, they brought a 
[03:29:30]  murder. I know they wouldn't settle for anything else except murder one. But idiots. That's so  interesting how LA just like, uh, because, uh, Robert, Robert Blake, the Robert Blake case.  I got involved with that a bit because, uh, he was in jail for, um, because of, um, he, there's  no bail because it was, um, uh, he was in waiting and hiding and waiting to shoot him. See, there 
[03:30:00]  was the death of the wife. Plus he was laying in wait was the thing that got him no bail. And  the reason that, that, um, uh, they was laying, they said he was laying in wait because the  gunshot wound was going from the jaw up into the head and a upward angle. So the police  thought that meant she was sitting up and he was like, he was below the window and shot  her. That was, that was the reason there was no bail. The lawyer called him. We talked 
[03:30:30]  to the lawyer about it. I said, the thing is if just cause the gun is, uh, shot is going  up, uh, that's how we describe things at the time of the autopsy. But if she saw a gun  coming and she leaned to the right, to the left, it would still be the same angle, but  it'd be horizontal and it's not laying in wait. And the lawyer for, uh, for, uh, Blake  was able to, uh, cross examine the, uh, uh, person who did the autopsy, the expert for 
[03:31:00]  the, for the, um, prosecution who agreed that that was not laying in wait, that this could  have been her reacting to a person she saw with a gun in the hand and that permitted him  to get out, uh, and to not be in jail while the trial, uh, preparation proceeded.  And he was, uh, he was acquitted. So, uh, in your personal opinion, uh, what do you think?  Following the rest of the trial? I think that, uh, I believe in the American system. I mean,  if the jury said not guilty, uh, it's really doesn't mean he didn't do it. It means that 
[03:31:30]  the prosecution didn't prove it.  Not prove it. Yeah, they didn't prove it. And, uh, I think that the prosecution has a  job to prove its case. And the problem is that, um, if we know somebody's guilty and we're  going to say that we don't need a trial, we know OJ's guilty, we know they're guilty.  Um, you're going to have a lot more innocent people in jail. We've got, uh, hundreds of innocent,  innocent, actually innocent people who have been serving time, have been on cat on death row  and stuff like that. And, um, we have to be careful not to, uh, make it easier to convict 
[03:32:00]  innocent people. And if a couple of, um, guilty people get free, that's the price you have to  pay for not getting innocent people. And so that's a delicate balance. So you think, let's put it this  way. You're, you're, you're right about the court system, but do you think when Robert Blake talks  to God or St. Peter, there may be an issue? Yes, there could be issues. Well,  there could be issues with all of us when we talk to whoever our maker is. And I don't 
[03:32:30]  mean to just keep going down the list, but you've been involved in so many interesting  things. Uh, what exactly is with the Klaus von Bülow? Klaus von Bülow was very interesting  because a lot of people think, do you think that he killed his wife? I don't know. Wasn't  she injured once and then killed? Or what was the story with that? She's still alive. Oh,  she is still alive. She's still alive. She's alive in a nursing home. This, this happened back  in, uh, in the, uh, 1977 or so 70 around that time. So that's over 30 years ago. And she's 
[03:33:00]  been in coma since, uh, but alive. Uh, and the issue with Klaus von Bülow, she was in one  and her mansion out on Newport, Rhode Island, and was found unconscious in her bathroom. And  the nurse who took care of her, uh, like Ms. Danvers in, in Rebecca or something, uh, was 
[03:33:30]  sure that the, that, that the husband had injected insulin into her, even though there was no  evidence. The, the evidence was faulty that there was any extra insulin in her body. And  she remained in coma. He was, there were two episodes, right? The two episodes as she lost  consciousness. But it turned out that there'd been studies done at Presbyterian hospital in  New York city that she had hypoglycemia, that she would drop her glucose, uh, very low, um, uh,  without any provocation and pass out. And that may, that's probably what happened to her that a 
[03:34:00]  couple of days after, uh, she was in the hospital, the barbiturate level, the sleeping pill and alcohol  came back very high and enough to kid to cause her to go into coma. But the, my impression is that  when I looked into the case and all was that once the, um, prosecutor had accused von Bülow of  injecting insulin and, uh, trying to murder her, uh, the doctors didn't come forth and say, no, 
[03:34:30]  she'd had an overdose of barbiturates and alcohol, which she may have taken herself because she was  drank a lot of alcohol, took a lot of pills, uh, because they didn't want to get sued for missing  the diagnosis. See, if they had treated her right away for the barbiturate overdose, uh, they, she  may not have gone into coma, into permanent coma. So I think she's in coma and he underwent two trials.  First trial, he was found guilty and then it was overturned. And the second trial, uh, with  Dershowitz and Puccio, Tom Puccio, uh, who found not guilty. So he's alive and out. He's alive and well 
[03:35:00]  in, in, um, London and with children and grandchildren. And she's, uh, in a coma for  30 years. And she's in a coma. Do you dream when you're in a coma? Probably not. You probably may  dream, but not know it because the, that part of her brain is totally atrophied. I mean, it's like,  uh, the gal down in, in Florida, uh, who was in coma for 10 years. You can have parts of your brain 
[03:35:30]  that are damaged and necrotic, uh, that you can't think, you don't see, you're, you don't feel  anything, but the breathing center and the cardiac center is still working. So with proper care,  you don't get pneumonia, you don't get ulcers, bed sores because she's being handled very, she can  live for a very long time just without any consciousness. What about the people that do  come out of it? Cause I mean, when you look at Shivo's, the videos of her, it really, even though they 
[03:36:00]  said it was a response, but when the father's talking to her and she's like, uh, even though  it was like, it wasn't like a really good conversation, it looked like she was somehow  hearing him. Yeah, an interaction. Yeah. Yeah. But that, you see, that's the problem. The  problem with these things is that families want to, in my experience, I don't know about  Shivo, they want to feel something for their loved one. They'll say, yes, she squeezed my  hand or she blinked her eyebrows or she looked like she was paying attention. And families  want to hear that. They look for that and it's not always there. Certainly when they 
[03:36:30]  did the autopsy in Shivo and examined the brain, it's not possible that she could have  known what was going on from the brain examination. Oh, so they were actually, the ex-husband  was right about it. Yeah. The ex-husband turns out he, I mean, he wasn't as likable as the  family and he had a girlfriend and all that, but he was right about her being in coma. And  in fact, uh, in the first couple of years, the doctors who treated her, there's something  to do with high potassium and all, uh, paid out money, you know, because of medical malpractice 
[03:37:00]  about Shivo. And now what they were saying 10 years later is that really it wasn't the  medical malpractice. It was the fact that he beat her up. Yeah. Oh, wow. And that was  turned out not to be true. Wow. So I don't care about, also about Sonny Von Bulo. I know, I know,  I know little, very little about comas, but isn't it like a type one or type two or something  like that? Once, whatever type you're in, you kind of look like you might come out of  it someday, but you never will. Is she, is she beyond ever coming out of it? Cause people 
[03:37:30]  wake up. It's called the Nagel. Yeah. Yeah. It's the Nagel. Yeah. The, the, the, uh, uh,  she, uh, um, Sonny Von Bulo will never come out of it. Uh, occasionally people come out  depending on what part of the brain is damaged. And it's amazing today with all the CAT scans  and the MRIs and all, one can get a much better idea of which parts of the brain are damaged  than was possible, you know, 20, 30 years ago. But it turns out with that, with Sonny Von 
[03:38:00]  Bulo, she'll never come out of it. Shiava would never come out of it. Some people are marginal.  Why would they just put her to like, like killer? I mean, or just unplug the machines or 31 years?  That becomes, that becomes, uh, a little moral question there. Yeah. That becomes a moral  issue. And also the issue is she's got enough money to, uh, she's got enough money that she's  paying for all this nursing care that she gets. And she has a big fortune to do that. The  issue becomes more, more telling when the person is on being paid for by the taxpayers of the 
[03:38:30]  city. Yeah. Like, uh, like, uh, I'm not going to pay for it, but I want the city to pay for  my, uh, mother's, uh, eternal, uh, survival in coma. And meanwhile, the money that goes to  that person doesn't go to kids who have, uh, uh, um, sore throats or rheumatic, uh, fever or,  uh, strep throats and all that stuff. So there's a delicate balance as to how much money society 
[03:39:00]  should pay for somebody who's not going to recover, even though the family wants it. Uh,  and it deprives, there's no limited budget anymore in medicine. You just, you just want  them all on the slab, don't you? You just want them all. See the slab. But one of the things  we do on the slab, you see, is we, we try to help the living by finding out what, what  happened. Uh, we can try and tell the families what happened. We can tell them if they have  any, uh, genetic problems to worry about. And we can help society if somebody's done something 
[03:39:30]  wrong to punish the wrongdoers also. So the reason we do the autopsies is to help the family  bring closure and to help society, uh, pursue whatever should be pursued when a death occurs.  Are you going to be called in? Very good. Are you going to be called in for the, uh, the Bigfoot  autopsy or? I saw the photos there. It certainly looks like a raccoon coat or something. But I  think I've been involved before with Bigfoot stuff because people. Have you really? Yeah.  People used to bring in, um, um, material or something. Yeah. Hair and blood spots that 
[03:40:00]  they saw in the woods to ask us to do, uh, serology to look for, uh, I hope you charge  them a lot. No, we, I found it interesting. We used to do it for free, but it all turned  out to be, you know, not true. So the, the little experience I've had with Bigfoot, they  ain't no Bigfoot, but, uh, um, we found one in the dumpster though there. We got to see  what that's all about. They have something that looked like, and the newspaper is like 
[03:40:30]  some kind of old raccoon coat or something. Yeah. Yeah. It looked like, uh, yeah, an old  raccoon coat. They threw some pig cuts in there. 23 skidoo. Well, but, but it's interesting  that there've been some, uh, uh, very well known, uh, uh, hoaxes, uh, on the, we had the  Piltdown, uh, man in, uh, in the, in, in the United States. Piltdown was London. It was  England, right? English case. Piltdown was the English case. In the 1920, in 1910s, um,  some people at an excavation site in England found skull and bones and a jawbone that looked 
[03:41:00]  like they came from the missing link, the missing link, because it looked part, part human  and part ape. And the professors in England all came down. They said, what a wonderful  point is the missing link. And it turned out that somebody was playing a hoax. They believe  it might've been Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, uh, because he had been in Africa and it was really  the jawbone of an ape and the skull of a human, you know, and he had put them together and  all these professors, um, uh, uh, thought it was real so that the fact that it was a hoax 
[03:41:30]  didn't come out until 1942 where after all of the professors had died because they were  afraid to embarrass the professors by saying, and then it turned out that it was a hoax because  people, somebody threw body parts into the, into the pit, uh, to make it look like it  was a new animal when it wasn't.  All right. Let's go to Alex in O-Town. Alex.  Hey, what's up guys?  Alex.  I had a, a question for the doc. I was going to ask him, uh, you guys were just talking 
[03:42:00]  about basically the whole procedure with, um, what, what happens, uh, how much care you  should give a, uh, you know, to, to somebody that's basically never going to come out of a  coma. My girlfriend has had cancer four times already. And, uh, she's had to go through  dialysis three separate times. And because of her having such a high risk of cancer, they're  telling her that basically she can't get a, uh, kidney transplant because they don't consider  it worth their time, I guess. Um, I just want to know what your opinion is on something 
[03:42:30]  like that.  Yeah. The problem with that kind of a, an issue, unfortunately for your girlfriend is that  there's a national organ transplant, kidney organ transplant organization that tries  to provide the kidneys toward the people who are going to benefit the most. And, uh, there  was a big criticism. Remember when Mickey Mantle, I think was dying of liver cancer.  Oh yeah.  And they gave him one.  And they gave him one. There's a big, there was a big, uh, a fuss made because he jumped the  line and he got the liver transplant that, uh, instead of somebody else getting it, even 
[03:43:00]  though he wasn't going to get cured because the cancer had spread through his body and  he died shortly thereafter. So they want to give it the kidneys to those people who are  going to live the longest as a result of the kidney transplants. And that has nothing to  do with the medical examiners. That has to do with a consortium of, um, uh, kidney donor  personnel. And the problem is that there's such a shortage of kidney, uh, kidneys for donate,  that are donated. And one of the things that the government is trying is to get more people 
[03:43:30]  to donate kidneys when they die.  Don't you think though, if you hit over 500 home runs, you deserve a kidney?  Uh, I think there's, there's, there's, there's a good issue there. I think as a, as a human  being, I, I feel that way, but not as a doctor.  All right. Thanks guys.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  We should let, uh, the good doctor go.  Yes. Fascinating having you here.  Well, it's good to see you guys and, uh, to see what comfortable surroundings they give  you. And they give you all this, uh, reading material. 
[03:44:00]  Oh yeah. Anything we need. Terrific. Thank you. Thank you so much. And yes, Peter, thank  you, uh, for, uh, stopping in with Dr. Pardon. Yeah. Thank you. Did you enjoy it there, uh,  Peter? Fascinating. Fascinating. What was your favorite part? Just always really good listening  to Michael. What are we, uh, promoting Michael? We should promote something after this hour  in my books, uh, HBO.com. Okay. Well, a bunch of books that I've written that I can get on 
[03:44:30]  Amazon, uh, two, um, uh, that are dead reckoning and, uh, I'm sorry. Um, dead reckoning, the  new science of catching killers is a new novel that's come out of series of novels, uh, of  fiction that's coming out. Uh, the first one was dead reckoning. The next one coming  out in January is skeleton justice. You got your books named after like heavy metal band  albums. Yeah. I went to go see skeleton justice last night. They kicked ass. Yeah. Get out 
[03:45:00]  of my way. All right. We're going to do line of the day and get the hell out of here. Sponsored  by carbonite.com. Carbonite backs up your, uh, computer hard drive.

Peter, what are you doing? You got enough pictures. Peter likes taking pictures.  Yeah. I can only imagine what the private collection looks like. Hey. Yeah. The  Queen Mary too. Hey, who collects dead tattoos? I do. That's true. Yeah. All right. Get  back here. Peter, keep snapping your pictures. Photos. Photos. Photos. Yeah. Not the actual 
[03:47:30]  tattoo. Real fast. We're still on the air. Oh. Because this came in. I didn't believe  it. And you collect dead people tattoos? Yeah. One of the ways we identify decedents is  by tattoos. They're very unique. And I got interested in tattoos a long time ago at the beginning.  And I've taken a hundred thousands of photographs of tattoos of people in New York City who died  in New York City. And regions have different kinds of tattoos. We have a lot of criminal tattoos 
[03:48:00]  in New York City. Prison tats. People who get them in prison. How do you know that? Prison  tattoos. Prison tats are different. Sure. And in other places, like the people coming over  from Cuba had Mario boat tattoos, which were different. And the East Coast tattoos tend  to be different also. So, um, uh, it's, it's been very interesting because you get all kinds  of interesting tattoos. Thumb through that little photo album. I had one. You're asking me what's 
[03:48:30]  the best tattoo I ever saw? Well, no, but you could answer that. Sure. Yeah. There was, uh, get a guy  who's, uh, a true story, who's, uh, an alcoholic who's dead. And he has on his, uh, uh, penis  tattoos, which are always very interesting. And it said on his, uh, uh, was your name and, you know,  made a prison type tattoo, which was not professionally done. Yeah. And when the brother came in,  and I asked the brother, uh, why, uh, uh, do you know what, that your brother had a tattoo 
[03:49:00]  on his penis? He said, sure. He said, what was the, uh, what, what did it mean? Because  often there's significance. He said, well, my brother was an alcoholic. He never had enough  money, uh, to get drinks and alcohol. So he'd go into a bar, true story, go into a bar up  to, uh, up to a, um, a guy he didn't know and said, I'll bet you a drink that I have your  name tattooed on my penis. And the guy would look at him and said, sure. And then he'd pull  out his, actually get a free drink. Your name tattooed. Your name. That's a long way  to go. How thirsty are you? Yeah. Well, you will just put prison dye ink in your dick and 
[03:49:30]  show it to people. For a drink. For a drink. Can you tell if an executive producer is gay  by his tattoos? There are certain gay tattoos. Yes. One, you want to get some tattoos? Steve?  We had, we had, uh, we had, uh, one of my best tattoos is, uh, a guy who was a hunting  scene, a hunting scene, multicolored professional with, uh, hounds and, and the, uh, fox tail  sticking out of the anus. He's running into the anus. And I, I, uh, thought that was a 
[03:50:00]  wonderful tattoo. I showed then somebody pointed out that it was a gay tattoo. I hadn't appreciated  that. Oh, here's Steve. You want to take a look at his tattoos? No, I noticed his tattoos.  These are professional tattoos. Yeah. Turn around. Show him that one. Why are you hiding  the one that might be the gay one? I'm not. I'm not. He's just holding my arm. See, these  are not criminal tattoos. No, no. These are professional. Sure. How long ago were they  done? Um, the most recent one is the one under my, um, bicep and that's about two years 
[03:50:30]  old. But he gets a paycheck as criminal. But you know what was interesting? In watching  the, in watching the, uh, Olympics, the great number of Olympians who have tattoos. Yeah.  But they're not criminal tattoos. They're little butterflies and names and things like that.  The criminal tattoos are like the cross, which is a Pachuco sign, uh, just, uh, with a line.  Not, not fancy like, uh, Steve has on him. And then, of course, the teardrop. LA. Teardrop  for the eye and the drug addicts. What does the teardrop mean? They just saw on Golden 
[03:51:00]  Pond? Yeah. It just, uh, as best I interviewed some people, just that they were sad about  something in their life and the mother died or something. I thought it was because they  killed somebody. Well, the killing tattoos are a little different. They're, uh, I thought  it was a tear job. TCB. No, no. The ones I saw were drug addicts who, uh, but there may  be, they can cross over. What were the killing ones? Uh, what are the murder notches? The murder  ones tend to be Pachuco tattoos at the base of the thumb, where in order to, uh, have 
[03:51:30]  this cross with three lines above it. Oh. Made a prison tattoo, three dots or three  lines. You had to commit murder, arson, and rape in order to properly put those on your  fingers. And then in prison, they knew you were a bad guy. Couldn't you just get someone  to tattoo it on you anyway? Yeah, but then, but then if you turn out to be a wuss, you're  not going to last very long. Yeah, you're not. You'll be the last one on that in prison.  That's right. The last one you mentioned. Yeah. That's right. We class a paycheck is criminal. 
[03:52:00]  Steve has a question. Uh, there isn't, doctor, there's an urban legend, uh, that apparently  music was a good band. Exactly. Uh, that, uh, when, when new bodies come into the morgue,  that, uh, protocol is to have the anus sewn up. No, no, no, not true. That's not true.  Mike, it's not true. Yes. Uh, suggested to you that you have yours. So what is we do look  at the anus cause sometimes one can tell if there's been sexual activity in the anus by the  shape of the anus, but that doesn't work usually either, but they don't get sewn up because 
[03:52:30]  anything that's inside you want it to come out. If they can't tell by the anus, can they  just look at the expression on the face? If it's really sad, they're like, well, maybe  it looks like you can't tell, you can't tell anything from what the face looks like, even  though in books they say, well, died happy, died not happy. It's because when we die, all  the muscles relax, uh, and we all become, uh, sort of faceless. And then depending on what  position the body's in on the left side and the right side and the front will depend 
[03:53:00]  how the rigor mortis is going to set in after death. So you can't, can you do a public service  and tell people not to watch, uh, their loved ones, uh, die? It's not romantic. That's the,  that's, that's the tough thing. Oh, we talked about earlier. Uh, when I, I started out really  in, in the, uh, business of, uh, treating living people. Sure. Uh, and I was an intern resident  in Bellevue hospital and the worst thing was watching people die, cancer, heart disease.  You couldn't do anything about it. That's terrifying. That's awful. And the family, it's awful. But 
[03:53:30]  once they're dead, and this is what people don't understand about, uh, um, uh, medical examiners,  once they're dead, they're out of their pain. And what we do is much less upsetting doing  autopsies, trying to help the living, uh, than watching people die. Right. Hmm. How about  the beheading videos? Did you see any of those? Oh, I saw Saddam Hussein and I read about,  uh, the guillotine. That's a quick way of, uh, doing away with somebody. But I, I mean  the Al-Zarqawi, uh, in the Middle East when they were beheading people with butcher knives. 
[03:54:00]  That's, that's awful. That's awful. It seemed like a really, a painful way to go. Like the  struggle for breath. Well, it depends how quickly it's done. If you can take, uh, a, a, a weapon  like a guillotine and just strike off the head, uh, that's much faster and probably less painful,  you know, actual physical pain than, um, uh, being shot, you know, in a, a, a, a, a firing  squad or, uh, even getting, uh, lethal injection. No, this was actually the state. They saw it  through the head with just a big butcher knife and you can hear the guy. That's terrible. 
[03:54:30]  That's terrible because they saw it through the neck. See, the neck part is about a third  of the, is soft tissue of the neck. And the heart part is the spine, spinal column. And that's  where, uh, it's hard to cut through, but if you have a, you know, person who knows what  he's doing, he might. Would you still be conscious as they're trying to hack through your, the  spine part of your neck? Yeah. You can still be conscious until they transect the spinal  cord, which takes some doing because you got to cut through tough bone. Oh, we saw some 
[03:55:00]  awful. I know it's awful. It's an awful situation. Well, Peter's depressed now. Let's stop.  Oh, wow. We were all having fun. Yeah, no kidding. Well, I just, you know. Peter, want more  pictures? Cheer you up a little bit? All right. Peter, Peter, it's, it's, it's, it's, uh, really  a thrill for him to take pictures of live people. Yeah. Bye, Peter. Thanks, guys. See you  guys. Thanks for what you need. All right. Enjoy your cruise. Thank you. Hopefully you'll find  a floater. Drag someone in for you. A man could dream, right? There you have that. All 
[03:55:30]  right. Doctors. A big man, Peter? All right. There you go. Very, uh, lovely to have them  in. They're fun, right? Yeah. Great guests. Oh, they're just a hoot. Fun-loving, fun-loving,  uh, corners. Uh, what do we got? One more runner-up line of the day? Here it is. You guys, you  don't watch, you don't watch TV? I didn't hear about it. You don't read papers. I'm sure I've  handed all your cash a few times. Ugly checking. Yeah, no. Line of the day time. End. The 
[03:56:00]  line of the day. You hit it. Here comes the line of the day. Line of the day. Line of the  day. I'm moving on. I'm moving on. I'm moving on. Boom! I don't know what's going on. I 
[03:56:30]  was doing something else. A sound effect wins, uh, line of the day? All  right. Yeah, that's kind of fun. All right. Well, we're back. Yeah. We are. We 
[03:57:00]  have anything big for tomorrow? No, what do we got? No guests. Why? What  happened with that? Uh, nobody approved any overbrake. Which ones? Um, I'm going to  just tell them. I didn't know if they're available anymore. Rolling. Let's try to get them to  improv. Mm-hmm. For a second. Oh. What? It's improv skills? Let's just do this. They stink. 
[03:57:30]  Did anyone else think that Peter the, uh, coroner was here to do the autopsy on, uh, Dr. Michael  Bond? Hey. With all that heavy breathing he was doing? Oh, I think some people thought  that was Jimmy. No, it was Dr. Bond. Jimmy crinkling the food. Someone goes, is he doing his interview  from a treadmill? I couldn't do it till now. I think he needs the nose, uh, uh, surgery Jimmy  head. He was too cool and too interesting to blow up a spot like that, but. Steve, who 
[03:58:00]  do you think we're going to be pitching? Hey, uh, Roland, what do you got? I let Roland  do that. Uh, nothing. Wait, yes. Oh, no, the, uh, um, Norm Macdonald. He's coming in  in a few weeks, you said. Is he? Yeah. I would say Norm would be fine. Oh, man. Okay. Good. Uh,  Rainn Wilson wants to call. No. Okay. The rocker, right? Yeah. He wants to call in because  he's filming the office right now. What about Steve Coogan? Uh, then. What about the dude 
[03:58:30]  from the office that, like, was selling drugs? I want to talk to that guy. Well, um, yeah,  we were pitched him, but, uh, he'll be back in New York in a month. Was he the black dude  that worked with Patrice in the, uh. Yep. Yeah. He wants to come in. In the, uh, warehouse.  Right? Yeah, but he'll be released before a month. Hmm. He'll be back in New York in,  like, two, three weeks. How about Steve Coogan? Yeah, they're checking his schedule  because he's flying in for one day. What about the guy from  Four-Year-Old Virgin who's in trouble for what? Beating up his chick or something?  Killed her? What did he do? Stab her? What? Oh. Yeah, he had a bit part. Yeah. Yeah, 
[03:59:00]  he went crazy, killed his girlfriend or something like that. Are we getting Michael Phelps? Um,  my friend is best friends with him. We're working on that because he's not doing any press.  You have a friend that's best friends with him? Yeah. Come on. Yep. Come on. What's that about?  Um, well, she knows him since childhood, so. You think we'll get him? Um, he, he's coming  in, well, because he's, he's not, don't be, he doesn't even secret tour dates or whatever,  but he's coming in sometime. Does he, uh, bang broads? I would assume so. Yeah. Oh, right. Yeah. 
[03:59:30]  Anyone else? There's, um, David Tyree from the Giants. Hmm. Steve, you didn't know who Phelps  was when we brought him up before? Comment? What? Um. I thought you said Phelps. Yes,  exactly. I thought you said Phelps. Um. This is your face. No, I don't think I did. But 
[04:00:00]  now I do. You didn't know who Michael Phelps is? Do you watch the Olympics? No, I haven't  been. Yeah, why would you as the executive producer? Yeah, Steve. I thought you liked somebody  with his swimmers build. Yes. That would be silly to watch the Olympics. Comment? No. The  Olympics stink. You gotta watch it for the show a little bit. Hey, watch the highlights. Look,  it's on right now. They got some things going on. Watch the highlights. He doesn't even watch  the highlights. That's what I'm getting at. You turn on the news, you go. Watch some highlights, 
[04:00:30]  Steve. We got another week of the Olympics. Here's some highlights. We got some highlights.  Hey, Fez. Michael Phelps. Fez. On a Fez, 12 to 3. All right, should we go? Yes. I gotta make a tanky.  Are they new to 3 or are they on vacation? They're off this week. They're off this week? They're  off? No. I saw him tape a secret show, though. Wasn't that for today? No. No. That was for the  secret show. Are they maybe doing a mask today or some shit? No. Yeah. Richard Lewis. Oh, Richard  Lewis is on masks. Richard Lewis. Yuck. He'll probably be interesting on masks, 
[04:01:00]  though, because he's such a fucking whack job. Yuck. He's on  a curvy enthusiasm now, so. I bet he's a good interview. You like him? I don't like  Richard Lewis. Never did. But you haven't met him? I don't know. I didn't need to. He  might be an interesting interview. I didn't want to meet him. Steve, what are you  scrolling? I had a whole bunch of emails that didn't get sent because my mailbox was 
[04:01:30]  full, and I'm sending him. That happens. I gotta go home. Yeah, I gotta go home. Yeah.  All right. Okay. I'll, um, I'll push my mic away and say I'm done. Let's suck each other's  dicks. Do I end it like, uh, Eric goes to break on CBS? Yeah, let's do that. Go! Go now! End the show  now! It's over! Booyah! Booyah! Booyah! Booyah! Booyah! Booyah! Booyah! Booyah! Booyah! </pre>
