<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with William Donahue of the Catholic League extending well wishes following a past controversy.  The hosts, referring to themselves with various offensive terms like "rabid radio retards" and "perverts," introduced their crew with equally insulting nicknames.  Anthony then detailed his frustration with early morning calls, leading to a discussion about sleep deprivation and the darkly comedic absurdity of receiving death threats during designated "death call hours."

The hosts recounted their relatively tame appearance on Hannity & Colmes, joking about Alan Colmes's perceived lack of influence.  They then moved on to comedic, and often offensive, commentary on news stories such as Britney Spears's child seat and Bush's immigration speech, escalating into increasingly exaggerated and vulgar hypothetical scenarios regarding immigration.  A Newsday review crew member, Mike, called in with a C grade review of the show's early days, prompting a discussion about workplace challenges, the Duke lacrosse case, and the media's handling of it.  A female caller recounted a knifepoint attack in Times Square, resulting in a mix of concern and insensitive, offensive jokes from the hosts.

The show then took a voyeuristic turn, with the hosts describing their detailed observations, using binoculars provided by their boss, Tom Chiasano, of a woman in a nearby building.  This prompted numerous listener calls sharing similar peeping tom experiences, leading to more crude and offensive jokes about the woman's appearance and behavior.  This voyeuristic theme continued heavily into the next segment, with numerous listener calls detailing their own observations and experiences, often involving theft and descriptions of witnessed sexual acts, all accompanied by the hosts’ crude and offensive commentary.  Audio clips of what they perceived to be a slurred speech by George W. Bush on immigration were played. A brief mention of Bill Cosby criticizing the Black community was made.  The segment concluded with a discussion about alligator attacks in Florida, interwoven with more listener calls and off-color commentary. A *Smoking Gun* guest was mentioned but did not appear.

The show continued with a discussion about the increase in alligator attacks, prompting a humorous, hyperbolic conversation about a woman's encounter with an alligator.  The hosts debated the morality of killing attacking alligators, with a heated exchange ensuing with a caller, Cheryl, whose interaction with the hosts became increasingly hostile and insulting.  The conversation shifted to Howard Stern and Rosie O'Donnell's reconciliation, with one host expressing regret over past harsh comments and recounting a comedic segment involving a fatwa against O'Donnell.  William Bastogne, editor of *The Smoking Gun*, joined in studio to discuss the site's coverage of various scandals, including those involving Bill O'Reilly, James Frey, and Charlie Sheen.  The remainder of this segment featured further off-topic discussions, including ringtones, mocking listeners, describing a walk in the rain, and engaging in crude jokes and offensive language.  They mentioned a planned live XM broadcast and listener-submitted content, including plans for offensive ringtones based on their own segments.


A caller, Brett, then reported on his "spreading the virus" marketing campaign for the show in Japan and Korea, detailing the bewildered reactions he received.  The hosts subsequently played songs from a book titled "I Hate Myself and Want to Die,"  including excerpts from "People Who Died," "Hurt," and "Sister Morphine,"  with extensive, crude, and often offensive commentary on the lyrics and their perceived sadness. Numerous listener calls offered ringtone suggestions, including a "wah-wah penis" ringtone.  A comedic bit about Ben's oversized penis was also included. The discussion veered into tangents, including detailed and offensive descriptions of the songs. The segment concluded with a discussion of "The Christmas Shoes," leading to further off-topic conversations and listener calls before a commercial break.

The final segment featured the hosts playing and mocking the songs "Flowers for Mama" and "Christmas Shoes,"  with extensive, crude, and offensive commentary from the hosts and callers.  Teresa, a caller, attempted to sing "Flowers for Mama," but failed to recall the lyrics, leading to more mockery.  The hosts' reaction to "Christmas Shoes" involved numerous sexually explicit and offensive jokes directed at the song’s subject matter.  A caller suggested "bonus time" before the end of the show.  More callers phoned in, as the hosts continued their comedic and offensive banter, including jokes targeting producer Ben.  The increasingly tired hosts' conversation became fragmented, filled with personal anecdotes about bowel movements and physical discomfort. The show ended with the hosts expressing exhaustion and making further crude jokes before signing off.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show on XM202.  Opie and Anthony!  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing William Donahue,  President of the Catholic League.  We all screw up. You guys are obviously very talented fellas.  I mean, you wouldn't have done so well before,  and then you bounced back very quickly.  So, I mean, you've got a great audience out there.  So what am I going to do? Just sit around here and lambaste Opie and Anthony  for the rest of my life?  I don't go around holding grudges with people.  You know, I move on, and, you know, I just wish you well. 
[00:00:30]  I just wish you well. Wish you well. Wish you well.  Push the button! Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No! Shut up!  Me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow! We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts. Stupid.  We stink. We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:01:00]  Opie.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  James.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing. We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  You're like Chuck.  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  E-Rock!  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care!  Shut up!  No.  What's wrong, Aaron? 
[00:01:30]  My car's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax. Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony.  Shut up!  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Well, let me tell you something, my crunk, McFriend.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[00:02:00]  Ma, please stop calling me.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Mom!  I'm not the Lord. I have to do this now.  Don't shoot, Lord!  Don't shoot!  I got nowhere else to go!  I got nowhere else to go!  That's terrific! 
[00:02:30]  That's terrific!  Ah!  Hey, that worked out perfect.  Nice cover-up.  I was starting in with the good morning.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We got a phone number for everybody.  1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Free.  Lots going on right off the bat.  We taped Hannity and Combs last night.  Yes.  A lot of people thought it was going to be on last night.  It's actually going to be on Friday.  Friday night.  We had to tape it so late because  El Presidente gave his little border speech  and that pushed it ahead 
[00:03:30]  so we had to tape it later than we normally would.  Which means, in turn,  we were up a lot later than we normally would be.  Which means I'm exhausted.  Exhausted.  I set my alarm this morning  and I'm really trying to push it  because I stayed in the city last night  so I'm trying to push every minute,  you know, every second that I can.  So I set the alarm  and I figure if I get in here at a quarter after five, 
[00:04:00]  I'm usually here about five o'clock,  maybe five after in the morning.  I push it so I can get like a quarter after five  because every minute is precious.  Precious.  When you do this.  What happens?  What happens?  Brr, brr, brr, brr.  The cell phone starts ringing.  Hello, Anthony.  Master Poe.  Well, where shall I meet you?  Me, me, me, me.  Wait, hello?  See.  Who is, why is,  John?  Yeah! 
[00:04:30]  That's your problem.  Don't call me!  No, that's your problem.  Why?  Why is it my problem?  How is it my problem?  When are you going to learn?  You just turn your cell phone off when you go to bed.  And then you miss a loved one dying.  So they're dead.  Who cares?  But you missed it.  They're dead.  There's nothing you can do.  When the phone rings between one...  Yeah, you could have been there.  No.  When the phone rings between one a.m.  Let's call it when the phone rings between midnight and when you wake up.  The death call hours. 
[00:05:00]  It's the death call hours.  There's nothing you can do.  They're already dead.  Get a good night's sleep because you're going to have a busy two weeks.  That is cruel, man.  What time did he call you?  It's reality.  I know it's reality.  He called me.  Now, it wasn't all that bad.  It was like five-ish.  But I had planned it out the night before.  Like, I'm asking my girlfriend, what time should I...  I go, I think I could push it five more minutes.  You know, those minutes are important.  There's a difference between five o'clock and 5.05 in the morning. 
[00:05:30]  We have really strange lives.  You've got to stop with the cell phone on in the middle of the night.  I turn off everything.  I cannot be left incommunicado.  Remember when the big deal was going down and they wanted us to sign, like, important documents  and they didn't get a hold of me?  I gave it to 9 o'clock.  They got me at 10.30.  I'm like, well, 9.15 and I go to bed because we've got a busy day tomorrow.  So I just turned off all my phones and everyone was really pissed off calling all night.  I'm like, oh, well, you missed your opportunity. 
[00:06:00]  Opie calls me up and says, it's like 9.30.  He goes, I'm going to sleep.  I shut everything off.  You actually hear in Opie's apartment the movie power down sound.  And then there's no getting a hold of him.  I sympathize with you, but you've got to turn the cell phone off.  We don't have normal lives.  Can't.  I need to.  Yeah, but you go to bed sometimes at 6 or 7.  Like your phone's not going to ring after 7 o'clock?  I know, but at that point I'm so tired it doesn't really wake me up. 
[00:06:30]  I understand the people that have more normal lives as far as getting up a little later in the morning.  So if you make it to 11 before you go to bed, the odds of getting a phone call from 11 to 7 in the morning are slim.  But we go to bed really early.  Yeah, I've gotten calls that when I've gone to bed at 6, 6.30 at night and you get calls at 7.30 or 8.  Most people can still call at that hour.  And I'm like, what the who, what, oh hey Anthony, what's up? 
[00:07:00]  Just, uh, how you been?  I've been sleeping.  I've been sleeping.  It really is your fault though.  The cell phone has to just be turned off.  There's got to be a way.  Has to.  You're paranoid.  Like you said, it's the death hours.  There's nothing you can do.  Even if there's a loved one in a car accident.  What if they're pinned in the wreckage?  You would live too far away for them to do anything anyway.  Did you ever see signs?  Yeah.  And the girl is pinned against the tree? 
[00:07:30]  And what's his face?  Are you there?  The Passion of Christ guy had to talk to her?  Mel Gibson?  When the car backed away, her innards were going to spill out.  Right.  And it was the only thing keeping the blood to her brain?  What do you do then?  Sorry.  I have an early schedule.  Back up.  I missed your sleep.  Sorry I missed your last words.  Were they going to be that important?  Probably not.  What do you say?  It hurts. 
[00:08:00]  Help.  Right.  Ow.  Could you make sure the mortician covers up the Jeep logo in my abdomen?  Exactly.  Can they help me?  Yeah, yeah, sure.  They can help you.  Yeah, you're fine.  It's putting buckets under your stomach.  You know who also helped me as far as getting the cell phones off?  Was Ben.  No more drunk calls from Ben.  Well, he's one that will call you at all hours drunk off.  Friends in general like to call when they're drunk.  Yeah.  Guess where I'm at.  I don't know.  Tell me.  Yeah, play the guess where I'm at game. 
[00:08:30]  Unfortunately, not rehab.  So we did Hannity and Combs last night.  It went well.  It's going to be on Friday night, I guess.  It was a fluff piece.  I don't think Hannity had any real agenda.  I don't even think he was prepared for the interview, quite frankly.  Jesus.  He's such a busy man dealing with the immigration and Bush's speech.  He was like, oh, yeah, I got Opie and Anthony tight.  It was a very big evening for Fox News and all of their guys over there because the president  got to get the board of speech and we were taping on the same day and we're just goofy  radio show guys. 
[00:09:00]  So we go in there and Hannity and Combs are there and I'm sure they wanted to get to that  part of their program.  So, yeah, it was kind of a nice fluff piece.  But that's kind of refreshing for us.  Usually we're sitting there and it's like we're in a witness stand on murder charges or  something.  It was kind of nice to just have a fluff piece.  It's kind of, yeah, it's really nice, actually.  We looked very relaxed because we knew we weren't in trouble.  How many interviews have we been able to laugh in where if we laughed, we would have looked 
[00:09:30]  like, oh, look at these scum bags.  They do this and they're laughing.  Yeah.  Now at least we're able to talk and laugh and have fun with the people that are interviewing  us.  And I had the line of the interview.  I don't know if they're going to use it.  Yes, it was very funny.  Well, I mean, it was Sean Hannity sitting.  As you're looking at your TV from left to right, it's Sean Hannity, myself, Anthony and  Alan Combs.  Sean Hannity starts the interview.  He's talking for, I don't know, 10 minutes.  They're going to cut it up into only a two or three minute piece. 
[00:10:00]  But Sean Hannity is talking for at least 10 minutes.  So we're all turned towards Sean Hannity.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, this voice out of nowhere asks a question and then it's Alan Combs.  So I turn around to look at Alan Combs to acknowledge him and start the conversation, answer  his question.  And Opie just looks and goes, he goes to Hannity and goes, oh, he talks?  Got a big laugh.  Well, he's just on that show for balance. 
[00:10:30]  That's all.  You got to balance it out.  And it's not much of a balance.  The liberal part of the show.  Right.  He's the liberal part that keeps everything fair and balanced.  That keeps the hate mail down.  It keeps the hate mail down.  It keeps the hate mail down.  Let's be honest.  Because you know Hannity's agenda is front and center.  Like his political opinion is front and center.  And then Alan gets to, you know, well, you know, Sean, I think that, oh, we're out of  time.  And he's the cute liberal man. 
[00:11:00]  They should have him like back near the window.  Just way in the back.  Way in the back.  You know, the president's approval rating really has reached an all-time, well, we'll  be right back after these words.  Stay tuned.  Because it's a really short-handed show.  So they should have him where he is and then just have Alan Combs way in the background  at his own little desk.  How about outside the studio?  And they never focus on Alan Combs.  It's just a long shot.  Like the depth of field.  He's all blurry in the background.  I think maybe they should put him outside the window like a fan that's just waving. 
[00:11:30]  And how did he do his show that way?  And he can call in on his cell phone every so often.  By the way, I didn't even know that the immigration thing was going down because, you know, I get  my news by looking at the front page of the New York papers and no clue that, you know,  Bush did the immigration thing.  Gave a little speech last night.  Well, there was much more important news for the papers to hit.  Both papers, actually, front page news. 
[00:12:00]  What is it?  Is it immigration?  No, not on the front page of the New York Post.  Oh, that's right.  Oops, Brittany does it again.  Uh, what?  Her baby Sean is in the back seat.  In a baby seat, but the baby seat is facing the wrong way.  Facing the wrong way.  Maybe she's driving in reverse.  See, officially, the baby seat should be where the kid is looking out the back of the car.  Yeah, the kid's back should face forward. 
[00:12:30]  That way it doesn't get whiplash or head injuries or something like that.  What's the big deal with this crap?  When we were growing up, we didn't even have car seats.  We barely had seat belts.  Let me tell you about my youth with my father.  All I remember was sitting in the front seat of an old rambler.  Do you remember a rambler?  You would, I guess, ramble in it.  But Dad used to drive around, and there would be a beer tucked between his legs there. 
[00:13:00]  He'd be able to, you know, drink as he drove.  And he'd jam on the brakes every so often, and you would just stare at what was a metal dashboard.  No padding, no airbags.  You're a kid sliding around a huge, slippery seat with steel in front of you.  Just steel.  That was it.  Car seat.  Get out of here.  That's all in the post, though.  I mean, at least the Daily News. 
[00:13:30]  The Daily News, at least, a little more responsible.  They have...  Oops.  She did it again.  She did it again.  The same headline.  The same photo.  The same picture.  The same thing.  Same, almost wording in the headline.  Yes.  Same photo.  It's that important.  Much more important than Bush ordering 6,000 National Guard troops to the Mexican border.  That should take care of the problem, by the way.  Yeah, we could use a few more people.  Just a few.  How many does that figure out with miles of border per person?  That'll take care of one. 
[00:14:00]  Per person.  That'll take care of one village on the border.  Yeah.  Well, you know...  It's kind of a nice start.  Like, I watched his speech, and believe me,  I'm more Republican than Democrat.  I'm a little more conservative than liberal,  but I'm really not one side or the other.  I kind of make up my own mind as I go along here.  But as far as ideas go,  it wasn't all that bad.  I watch, and I'm just so prejudiced against anything Bush says these days, 
[00:14:30]  just like most people,  that you kind of watch and go,  shut up.  Just shut up.  And I'm sitting there, like,  making up my own words for his speech.  You know, our plan,  and before he says what the plan is,  and I just yell out, blurt out,  we've got to kill all the Mexicans.  Just kill them all.  Like, it would be hysterical to see the president come out with something so  completely ridiculous like that.  We've got to build us a wall,  and then just gas anybody that's a little browner  than this pink chip I got from Martin Banks.  You know, just some, 
[00:15:00]  where everyone's staring at the TV going,  oh my God, did he just really say that?  But it's not an awful idea.  He kind of did a thing where he kept everybody happy  as far as the amnesty issue went,  because a lot of people don't want to give instant amnesty  to everybody who's here.  It's not fair to the people that went through the legal channels.  Right.  And then he also said he doesn't want to just go around  rounding people up and booting them into Mexico.  So he kind of has this intermediate plan,  where people that have been here for a few years 
[00:15:30]  and are contributing to society  have kind of a steady job and a home  and have been here for a certain amount of years  will get to apply for citizenship  as long as they fit the criteria.  They're not going to get any special treatment.  And here's the big thing,  they have to pay a penalty  for having lived illegally in this country for so long,  which means taxes.  Pay your goddamn taxes.  So that seemed okay.  A little more stepping up of the security on the border  by bringing 6,000 National Guard troops in,  which is a touchy situation. 
[00:16:00]  The president's power to deploy troops statewide  gets a little iffy.  You're not really allowed to deploy the National Guard  for things like arresting people in states and stuff.  Yeah, it hits this level where it's a little  martial law-ish.  So they'll be doing logistics and building a wall  and putting in the night vision stuff.  And the border patrol is going to be stepped up  and they'll take the lead on arresting the people  and sending them back.  I like Carl Mencia's idea. 
[00:16:30]  Make a really tough obstacle course.  An obstacle course.  You get the healthy, good Mexicans.  At least you get the really strong ones.  Like they'd have to step through tires at some point,  like football players.  Swim, climb.  Swim, climb.  Kind of like a survivor obstacle course.  Yeah, bicycling, swimming.  Oh, yeah.  No, like, yeah, what was that show back in the 70s?  Battle of the Network Stars.  Give them a Battle of the Network Stars obstacle course.  Do they get a network star captain?  Right.  Like Robert Conrad and Dan Haggerty? 
[00:17:00]  At least make it interesting.  Then film it and make it into a reality series.  Yeah.  And then there was one other thing  that just seems like it's not going to work out very well.  An entrance to the border  where people can actually kind of check in and check out.  If they have a job to go to, an illegal job,  at least they'll be able to get identification  and know that they can come in and work  and get a guest worker's pass for a certain amount of time  as long as this job lasts, 
[00:17:30]  these jobs that Americans apparently don't want.  And then they, you know, go back when that period of time is over.  Well, how about this?  They throw them out,  and Americans that don't want them try to collect welfare  and then get the option of either doing that job  or fucking eating out of a garbage can.  Oh, or effing what?  Oh.  Remember where we are, Jimmy?  We're on Free FM, Jimmy.  We're on Free FM.  That doesn't mean free, to use the F word, FM. 
[00:18:00]  I'm just tired.  I want my freedom, man.  Jimmy just blurted that out, and it was great.  He kept going.  Well, you made a great point, but they dumped out.  I know, you did make a great point.  Yeah, they dumped out for political reasons, man.  Yeah, man.  You're stifling my political freedom.  They didn't like your agenda.  My first one.  Yeah, yeah.  You usually don't slip around here.  No, I went to bed at like 1.30.  I'm just really tucking out.  A little tired.  Anything fun last night, Jimmy?  No, I'm just doing sets, trying to get ready to go to Leno again in June sometimes. 
[00:18:30]  Oh.  Would that be Jay Leno?  Yeah.  Okay, that's the good one.  And then I, you know, went to bed.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  Did you get an effing good night's sleep, potty mouth?  Oh, I did.  Let's just say I received treats of some sort.  Oh, you did.  I certainly did.  You, uh, you might have, uh, uh, hired somebody.  No.  No?  No.  Wait a minute.  You picked up somebody?  I, no, somebody I knew. 
[00:19:00]  Oh.  I forgot that women did that for free.  Yeah, yeah.  Found a friend, did you?  I certainly did.  Ooh.  And then after we were finished, this is the truth.  She's laying there, and she's looking at her feet, and she goes, my bunions hurt.  Ah!  How old is this broad?  She's 25.  Oh.  And her bunions were hurting.  Her bunions hurt?  Yeah.  Was she on her dogs all day?  My dogs are barking.  Boop.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break? 
[00:19:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Here you go.  Have a Dr. Scholz and some AZT.  You'll need both.  The phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  When we get back, we got to talk about what is in front of all of us today.  Let's just tease it as that.  We are being treated like gods here.  We really are.  XM really has to start stepping up because they're taking care of us over here at FREE-FM.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Steve SOS, I need milk immediately. 
[00:20:00]  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show, Milk Diva.  Milk Diva.  World Tour.  World Tour.  Featuring all your favorite Milk Diva hits.  Live.  Live.  In concert.  My blood sugar level is dropping as I speak.  Featuring the classic, there's a deli downstairs.  There's a deli right downstairs, is there not?  Oh, that app gets milk from Dwayne Reed.  You could forget the number one smash hit.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I'll suck milk out of a cow.  I don't care.  I just need milk. 
[00:20:30]  A special guest.  The Milk Diva.  I walk into the studio and he goes, where's my milk?  Why are you going to Dwayne Reed for the milk?  And for the first time in over a decade, you don't bring me milk anymore.  And then I'm noticing there is no milk around.  So I'm like, eh, I will pass out.  You sound like a madman.  I know I'm whining.  The Milk Diva.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie wants milk.  He only takes it from CVS or Rite Aid.  Who would go to Dwayne Reed for milk knowing that, how desperate I am right now? 
[00:21:00]  You're getting condoms and maybe some shampoo from Dwayne Reed.  You don't get milk from Dwayne Reed.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:21:30]  Last bit of my breakfast.  One more swallow.  Oh, used to be able to down that stuff in seconds when we didn't have commercials.  Mikey the Terrible on the instant feedback from, well, we can't say the website yet.  We're still trying to figure out how we can say our websites on the air.  We'll get that figured out.  Go to our MySpace.  Yeah, go to our MySpace account, Opie and Anthony, and all the websites are listed there, okay?  Join MySpace. 
[00:22:00]  Is little Jimmy tired because someone forgot to put a towel over his head?  Oral treats, oral treats, oral treats, towel.  That was really, really funny yesterday, Jimmy.  We've got to go to the phones, 1-866-313-FREE, and say hi to Mike in New York.  Mike, what's going on today?  How you doing, man?  All right, Mike.  You're on.  What's going on with you guys?  You know who this is?  Welcome aboard, Mike.  I wrote you guys that Newsday review last week. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, you're part of the review crew?  Yeah, I'm part of the review crew.  How does one get to be part of the review crew?  I read the paper every day.  They had an ad in there for it.  I applied, and they picked me.  How lucky am I?  Do they pay you?  No, they don't.  It's actually, I get comped for everything I review.  Hmm.  But what do you, wait, what do you get comped, though?  What can they give you to review the radio show?  What can they give you?  It's for free anyway.  If that, they don't give you anything.  Oh, okay. 
[00:23:00]  Well, here's your review from last week, by the way.  It was in Newsday.  They do this review crew thing that we think just stinks.  We don't like it.  We think review crew stinks.  It's communistic.  And they decided to review the show after, I don't know, four days.  I could have you shot for that.  I could have had you shot for that.  If that.  Michael 26 from Ron Conkoma.  This is what he had to say as part of the review crew last week.  David Lee Roth lasted less than six months.  No real shock there.  So what does 92.3 Free FM do?  Bring back an Oscar-sized cult favorite.  Their show, much like Stern's, doesn't do much for me. 
[00:23:30]  It always seems to become a bunch of random talk and backhanded comments about other radio shows.  Oh, I remember this one.  Yeah, the guy that described a talk show.  Yeah, you're part of our promo that they've been running for ten straight days.  Maybe they'll update that soon.  With an established show on XM, they should be ready to go without needing much time to adjust.  But that isn't the case.  They'll draw ratings with their reputation and following of loyal diehards, but not much else.  Grade C.  They'll draw ratings with their reputation and following of loyal diehards, but not much else. 
[00:24:00]  But that's the whole reason we're here, to get ratings, Mike.  Yeah.  I got you.  That's fine.  I just see you guys didn't do too much for me.  That's all I'm saying.  We were only on the air three, four days.  I figured you'd be more ready to go, being on XM for a couple of years, you know?  Ready to go.  The studio wasn't even ready.  It was echoey in here.  It was echoey.  We weren't used to the headphones, the microphones.  It's FM radio, not XM radio.  It's a new job.  What do you do, sir? 
[00:24:30]  Actually, I'm a forensic scientist for the city of New York.  A forensic scientist.  When you first started, were you a little, like, I don't know, a little leery, a little nervous, a little unfamiliar with your work environment?  A little bit.  You weren't, Joe.  You didn't just go into the lab and start knowing where everything was.  You weren't like Quincy the first week.  Right.  Putting your lunch in the same refrigerator that holds the brain.  Yeah.  Bossing Sam around because he's Asian and svelte. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  Yeah.  So, you know, I don't know why people think radio is any different.  Have you been listening more?  Well, actually, I would have been listening more.  I only found out about what you guys said on the show yesterday because I went on vacation.  So I was out of the country, came back, and all my friends were giving me crap.  They're like, oh, you were on O&A.  So I listened to it, and I was like, oh, crap.  I figured I'd call them this morning and see what was going on.  But, yeah, from what I've heard, you guys are pretty damn funny. 
[00:25:30]  It slowly kind of catches on.  That's why we call it the O&A virus.  Yeah.  And we've only been at it about three weeks.  This only started feeling comfortable, like, late last week.  Well, that's good.  I'm glad you guys are feeling comfortable because you're way better than the other guy was.  I just want to know, Wico, what a forensic scientist, what do you do?  Well, actually, I work in the DNA section of the lab.  Oh.  Yeah, we do.  So you check out a lot of lacrosse players' fluids and stuff like that?  Yeah, yeah, we do. 
[00:26:00]  That's turning out to be a big bust for the prosecution there.  They found no DNA on any of the three?  They found a little bit of consistent DNA with one of the guys under her fingernail, a piece of fingernail that was actually in the trash.  But there was so much waste in there that it could have gotten from anywhere.  But what was from the rape kit that they got?  They could have been from anybody she had sex with within five days, and none of them matched the lacrosse players.  So it looks like a case of a girl just kind of crying.  Yeah, they're hinting that she had sex with one of her boyfriends. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  That's the DNA they're finding.  So do you work for the police department, Mike?  No, actually, we're all civilians, so we're not affiliated with the police department.  What, different departments kind of sub out the work to you guys?  Yeah, sort of.  I mean, we get all their cases.  Anything that the PD picks up or gets reported to them comes to us.  That's wonderful.  That's what we handle.  Anything extra is all yours, right?  You get to take home.  What are you going to be reviewing in the near future?  What's your next project as part of the review crew? 
[00:27:00]  Well, I'm still waiting for them to give me my next one, but I'm going to be done soon.  They switch us out every six months or so, so we're on the tail end of our time there.  Yeah, I don't want you building up too much of a power base there.  Well, the review crew, they reviewed gas prices yesterday, and today they're all about the Sopranos on Newsday.  Yeah.  I haven't seen the new one yet.  You don't need to.  Don't spoil it.  Yeah, don't ruin it for me.  All right, Mike.  That's all right.  Thanks, Mike.  All right, all right.  There goes Mike, part of the review crew.  He didn't give us a good review.  He gave us a C after three days on the air, but now look. 
[00:27:30]  I think he's up to about a C-plus now.  I think he's a, yeah, well, our grades are getting a little better with Mike.  He's got a little itch as far as the ONA virus goes.  Here's the latest audio on the Duke lacrosse thing.  A new face has emerged in the Duke lacrosse scandal.  And it's a glazed donut.  Standing before the media, the 23-year-old calmly defended himself and his teammates.  I'm absolutely innocent of all the charges that have been brought against me today  that Reed Seligman and Colin Farney are innocent of all the charges that were brought against them.  You have all been told some fantastic lies. 
[00:28:00]  Evans, one of three team captains, spoke for several minutes without notes,  denying that players raped an African-American exotic dancer on the night of March 13th during a party.  Stop that. Why do they have to mention that she's black when it's a rape case?  Never said black. They said African-American.  Oh, my fault.  Go ahead, play it. I stay.  The night of March 13th during a party at this off-campus house.  I've repeatedly, through my lawyer, tried to attempt, tried to contact the district attorney. 
[00:28:30]  All of my attempts have been denied.  Evans was identified by the alleged victim as one of her attackers with 90% certainty.  According to a transcript, she wasn't completely certain because she believed that Evans had a mustache at the party.  David Evans has never had a mustache.  Oops.  We have pictures of David Evans from the day before, the day after, and almost every other day.  Ah, he's off the hook.  He's off the hook.  No mustache and no DNA, and they still charge him. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Oh, they were hanging these guys out to dry a few weeks ago.  And I don't like the fact that there was no racial implication in the case, and they still mention the race.  Again, I hate to say it, but there's been rape cases where there's black guys raping white girls.  There's been?  But I'm saying, when's the last time you heard, and they raped a white woman?  I mean, you haven't heard that in the paper since 1957.  It usually ended in something like a lynching.  But, you know, they just have to throw that in there. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Who cares?  And I don't think they're guilty.  That's, by the way, what an innocent person sounds like.  You get up and go, no, she's lying.  Yeah.  You don't hide behind your lawyer.  Your lawyer's saying all kinds of things where it could happen, but they're trying to kind of brush it under the...  That's an innocent guy going, hey, no, uh-uh.  No, sorry.  I've been trying to tell you this.  I'm innocent, and you've heard a lot of lies, and there's no DNA and no mustache.  What if the guy had a fake mustache on so he would be incognito?  One of those real bad ones.  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  He's back at his dorm room going, oh, I fooled them.  And the funny glasses.  Exactly.  He had eyes that came out on springs, I swear, and big waxy tasting lips.  And he was smoking a cigar and starring in Day at the Races.  And his brother tooted a horn in my ear while they all raped me and played lacrosse.  He gave me a piece of gum, and it made my whole mouth turn black.  A gift?  No.  He shook my hand, and it went...  And he put rubber doo-doo on me. 
[00:30:30]  I sat down in the chair to relax and heard...  Then there was plastic vomit all over the sheets.  Hey, we got to say hi to some girl in New York City.  Hey, what's up, you guys?  Hey, some girl.  Hi.  Yeah, I just didn't want to mention my name.  We figured that.  Okay, um, I was attacked a while ago, and...  Oh, bae.  That's terrific.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  That's terrific.  No, Bobby De Niro should not be chuckling at that. 
[00:31:00]  What happened, miss?  Well, whenever I...  If I do talk about it, and I say I was attacked, people always ask, was he black?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  And, um, what is your answer for that?  No, he wasn't, actually.  Hey, where are the white women at?  So, you were attacked by a white guy.  Yeah, but I just, I agree.  I like what Opie said about, you know, why do they have to mention... 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, that's what I said.  Now, that was a good point that Opie mentioned.  Drew Boogie brought that up.  That's right.  Anything intelligent on this show, I say, so remember that.  The weird part is, next time someone says, was he black, you should just say, he may  as well have been.  What were some of the circumstances, quickly?  Like, what happened?  I was on the street, and...  What street?  Like, where?  In New York?  Yeah.  I was, like, it was, like, one in the morning.  Oh, boy.  And I was, like, right across the street from Caroline's.  It was really weird. 
[00:32:00]  In Times Square?  Yeah.  It was, like, a Monday night.  Comedy club.  And you were alone?  Yeah.  Oh, God, you girls are so stupid.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I gotta say it.  You girls are stupid.  I was coming out of Colony Records.  I bought some music.  Okay.  What kind of music?  It was a Dinah Washington song I was looking for.  What song?  Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby.  Oh, see?  You were asking for it.  I went to iTunes.  So, who would actually pay for that in public? 
[00:32:30]  So, you walk out, and the sidewalks are empty in Times Square on a Monday at 1 a.m.?  Yeah.  You start walking.  Now, I know for a fact you probably had a bad feeling before anything happened.  Yeah, it was weird.  I switched directions, but obviously I switched in the wrong direction.  Oh, 50-50 shots.  Oh, wow.  And you walked into, what happened now?  Did he jump out at you?  He came up to me, like, put a knife to my face.  Ouch.  But out of nowhere, he just puts a knife to your face.  Did you?  It was weird. 
[00:33:00]  Wait, wait.  Did you feel someone walking up to you?  Did you see him coming?  Was he coming toward you from behind you?  Like, what happened?  Well, I really don't want to talk about it.  Well, you don't have to get into gory details.  I just want to know what...  I was just walking, and I was looking for a cab, and there was a lot of noise, I remember,  and a big truck went by, and I was, like, almost to the middle of the block, and it was weird.  The way the guy just, like, he was running.  He was totally crackhead out. 
[00:33:30]  It was weird.  Running, like, toward you?  Yeah, well, he was out of his mind, and it was really weird.  Goddamn, you girls can't be alone in the city.  Did he assault you, or did he, like, just...  Was it, like, a sexless...  He put a knife to my face, and he slammed me up against this, like, smooth black granite pole or something,  and it was, like, kind of, like, in...  Like, off the sidewalk, but, like, on the entrance to this building,  and it was weird because there were cameras there,  but the cameras weren't in that position at that particular time. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, boy.  So, he's out there somewhere.  Asshole.  Oh, excuse me, sorry.  Yeah, that's okay.  That's all right.  And he forced himself upon you?  Yeah, I kept saying, you don't want to do this.  You don't want to do this.  And he said, no, believe me, I do.  Jeez.  Yeah, it was...  So, what do you do now to protect yourself?  I don't go out alone.  Did they ever catch him?  No.  No, they never catch guys like that.  It's just, like, this random, you know, it's very hard to...  And there have been other girls, like, with the same MO that happened, like, in that area. 
[00:34:30]  Like, it's really weird.  Well, hopefully somebody will catch up with them with a rifle.  Too late.  It's too late at night.  There's not enough people around you, and you're not with a friend or anything.  Yeah.  The girls should just, like...  You should have been out in the middle of, like, 7th and Broadway,  just walking in the middle of the street.  I was going to, but I walked uptown instead, and it was so stupid.  I was just trying to get a cab, and, like...  Wait, was this on...  Wave down a cop, you know? 
[00:35:00]  Was it on Broadway that this happened?  I'm sorry?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's kind of hard.  I mean, look, you think...  I mean, it's late, it's late, but it's...  Yeah, but you think Times Square on Broadway, right?  It seemed...  It was, like, an eerie...  It was really eerie.  I've seen it, though, where it's been pretty desolate there at night,  especially at that hour, and if you're walking on the sidewalk  and you're close to the buildings, there's a lot of nooks and crannies  where these nuts can just, like, drag you into.  Yeah.  If you're a girl and you're alone at that hour, walk in the middle of the street.  Yeah.  I've done that, and if I ever am, like, alone for, like, a block or so, 
[00:35:30]  I always walk in the middle of traffic.  Middle of traffic.  Scroll.  It's easier.  It's almost safer.  Do you carry mace now?  Pardon?  No, I'll carry it with a lit cigarette, or just...  I'm just more aware.  A lit cigarette?  Why should we, can I have a smoke afterwards?  That's about the only thing that's going to do.  A lit cigarette so you can hear, ow!  Now you've really made me angry.  Yeah, really.  Really fast.  Miss, carry mace.  A lit cigarette is not going to do...  A secondhand smoke, there's not enough time for that to be effective. 
[00:36:00]  Where's 30 years to wait?  Yeah, but carry mace or pepper spray and just blast his...  Filthy mouth or eyes with it.  Can we have a program in this city where the people that can't shoot their intended targets,  that hit innocent children and stuff, hand their guns over to people that could really  use them, like this woman?  Yeah.  Can we just have it where we hand illegal weapons over to the people that can kind of just  use them?  Well, maybe we should take guys that are jerks and get arrested and use them as, like, target  practice for people. 
[00:36:30]  Target practice?  That's a good thing.  I'm sure you've had quite a few disgusting fantasies in your head about killing people over the years,  but you sound like you've adjusted pretty well.  How many years ago?  It was about six years ago.  Yeah, you doing all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  I love you guys.  You're hysterical.  Thank you, some girl from New York City.  Okay, you guys have fun.  Best to you.  Bye.  Thank you for calling.  Some girl, everyone.  Girls gotta learn, man.  They are like...  They're like a prize out there to some sickos, and you can't be alone. 
[00:37:00]  Every one of them.  And I know it's the worst thing to do and say, it's your fault.  It's your fault.  And, you know, it's not your fault.  There are kooks out there.  It's their fault.  But there are things that have to be done.  You gotta look around.  You gotta be paranoid.  That's what you gotta do.  Walk around paranoid.  Because it could happen.  Walk in the middle of the street like a nut.  Speaking of kooks, creeps, and really horrible guys...  I can't believe...  Are the lights on yet?  I can't believe I'm gonna say this, Anthony, but... 
[00:37:30]  Oh, they are.  But we love Tom Chiasano.  We certainly do.  Of course we do.  How could you not?  So far, he gets our radio show.  We'll see what happens as we move forward.  But so far, so good.  Mr. Chiasano has realized that he's hired a bunch of creeps that like voyeuristic activities.  Yeah.  And we've been looking out this really large window ever since coming to Free FM here in  New York City.  Jimmy's in my way. 
[00:38:00]  Steve's in my way.  He made our viewing much, much better by handing us all binoculars.  So yeah, some really nice binoculars were handed to us this morning.  The lights just came on in our girl's room.  She does her exercise bike for a little while.  Then she goes in.  She takes all her clothes off.  Goes into what I guess is her bathroom.  Showers.  Comes out.  Nude.  Lotions.  And then wiggles the jeans on.  And then wiggles the jeans on.  Goes through 18 different outfit changes before she figures out what she's wearing that day 
[00:38:30]  for work.  So now we're going to get a nice close-up today, thanks to the binoculars.  Thanks to the binoculars.  Because there's been speculation whether she's hot or not.  And her lights just came on?  Her lights just came on.  We don't see her yet.  She's probably in the bathroom.  Yeah, right on schedule, actually.  What's that?  She just had her top off before.  Well, thanks for telling us, Steve.  The show is secondary to nude woman.  You guys are in the middle of that segment, and it doesn't matter.  That segment was boring.  It was literally a second and a half before she got her hair off in my way. 
[00:39:00]  You guys interrupt the show for that.  Really?  Yeah, really.  What are you, a faggot?  Of course, really.  Really?  Oh, don't.  No, no.  I don't want to see a nude girl.  No one around here wants to see a nude girl, Steve.  If you got from the console to the window, she wouldn't have been topless anymore.  All I want to hear is topless, and then at least we got a shot to check it out.  Steve is lying.  There really is no right answer.  If he would have interrupted, somebody would have yelled at him.  We're doing a bit.  Why would you interrupt with that?  She'll be there in a minute.  Thank you, Jimmy, for once.  There's no winning. 
[00:39:30]  There is no winning.  I'm either a fag or I'm an interrupting ass.  How about both?  Thank you.  Can we cut that up and use it in a promo?  Yeah.  What else did we see today?  We saw a chubby girl.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, there's a chubby girl.  What?  Oh, my God.  There was a chubby girl.  What?  What, Jimmy?  Her furniture.  And then something in a darkened room I couldn't quite make out, but there was movement.  Wait, right now there's an American Indian using a drill to drill through a woman on the top floor. 
[00:40:00]  Building of murder.  Anthony, by the way, Bert in Philly, this girl's got to be doing this on purpose, we think,  because there's no shades whatsoever, no blinds.  They're completely open.  Not a hint of a curtain or a blind on her window, and the light is on.  She faces this huge, huge building.  Yeah, it's not like your little house on the prairie over here.  There are buildings all around you, and she pops out of that bathroom.  She's exposed where she is to hundreds and hundreds of other windows that could be looking at her at any given time. 
[00:40:30]  We've got to get a telescope to take a look at these buildings that are a little further away, by the way.  That's the next step, telescope.  You've got 40-time magnification on the binoculars.  I'll tell you the next step is turn the lights off in the studio.  One time we're looking out, and it stops those reflections from bouncing off.  Oh, really?  How do you know this, Jimmy?  Just because I'm looking through, I can see the light bouncing.  Oh, okay.  Not that I've...  No, no, no.  I don't have anything at all.  But you kind of wrote the book on this one?  Yes.  When peeping.  All right, let us know what's going on over there, guys. 
[00:41:00]  We need a 30-story ladder.  Yeah, the second you see her come out, let us know.  Maybe give that job to someone else besides Steve.  Exactly.  What?  There's a gentleman that just...  Oh, excuse me.  I need to interrupt the show.  Gentleman is nude.  He gets so mad.  Now he'll interrupt for anything.  Maybe she's making waffles.  Good.  Good.  Every time she cuts an orange.  I'm perfectly enunciating ass. 
[00:41:30]  You're welcome.  Ooh.  All right, we're going to take another break.  On the way, we got Bush sounding very drunk last night.  Yeah, maybe a couple of drinks before the speech.  I don't know.  We'll play it and let you decide.  Also, the Rocky IV speech that we were talking about yesterday on the second half of the Opium  program won't do that for exam.  Why?  It moves everybody.  Well, we got the speech that you were talking about, how awful it is.  I sent Danny on an assignment.  Yeah?  Hopefully, that'll be good and he'll have that. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, apparently, it's another Bill Cosby tape off of CNN.  Bill Cosby pulls no punches in his comments on modern black culture.  I love Cosby.  He really is not into hip-hop culture and e-bombs.  Oh, we got it.  Oh, we got it.  Danny is the manny.  Black people.  Can I say that without sounding like a complete retard?  You sound like a gangbanger when you talk that way.  Danny is the manny?  Kid rhymes. 
[00:42:30]  Bill Cosby on blacks will do that next.  How's that sound?  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Responsible parents everywhere, Opie and Anthony are now back on the regular airwaves.  So take your baby off that windowsill and sit him in front of the radio.  To hear the shriek of a small child, that would be wonderful.  Opie and Anthony Dash, bring in the funny.  Opie and Anthony, weekday mornings.  Getting right back into the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:43:00]  A lot of staring out the window during the break.  Oh, my God, everybody.  With the brand-new binoculars that Tom Chiasano gave the entire staff.  Thank you, Tom.  And Anthony, for some reason, knows her entire schedule.  She's on the exercise bike now?  Yeah, here's what she does.  She gets up.  She goes into the bathroom.  And, you know, I guess goes.  It takes her a little while.  Then she brushes her teeth.  Then she comes out of the bathroom in kind of some lycra pants and a sports bra 
[00:43:30]  and gets on her exercise bike, which she does for about 15 to 20 minutes.  So we're good for a while.  For a little while.  She's been on it now for a few minutes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  She's dicing a papaya.  Thanks, Steve.  Quick, guys.  Stop the show.  She's swiffering the kitchen.  No, wait.  I think it's Muppin' Glove. 
[00:44:00]  So after the exercise bike, you were telling us that she strips down immediately?  After the exercise bike, when she stops and gets off of that bike,  she will then take off what she's got on and go into the bathroom to shower.  So that's your key moment.  Goes by very quickly.  When she comes out of the shower, then you have a little more time  because she spends some time drying and lotioning.  That's where you get your maximum viewing time.  But we'll get a little something when she's done with the bike.  Unless she, you know, one day decides to take her clothes off in the bathroom. 
[00:44:30]  But we haven't seen that yet.  And that's the only action we got so far?  I mean, we're looking at hundreds of windows.  Yeah.  Oh, believe me.  There's a fat woman in a muumuu in that bigger window.  And then there's some dude over there.  We can't get girls up here for contests.  And we're excited.  We're watching a five on a bike.  She is the ten of the building, though.  She is.  I'll tell you that.  We've been looking around at this building.  And this is the ugly building. 
[00:45:00]  It really is nasty.  And she is the only one that doesn't have shades or blinds.  And she's on the exercise bike, so apparently, you know, she's working out.  She's working on it.  She had a little bit of a tummy.  Oh, she likes to be watched.  Yeah, you pedal that bike, you bitch.  Let's go to Lorenzo in Westchester.  Lorenzo!  Yo!  Hey.  Good morning.  What's going on, guys?  What's going on, man?  Love your show.  I just want to share a little story I have.  I stumbled over a chick in the floor going to work. 
[00:45:30]  I go to work at five in the morning.  And all of a sudden, one day, I looked into this window.  And I seen some chick in the window with her top house hanging out.  Yeah.  I mean, awesome, bro.  Every day, religiously now, I stop there with binoculars.  The chick's got a routine.  She gets up out of bed.  She goes into this one room.  She turns the TV on.  She takes her clothes out of the closet.  She goes inside.  She comes back out with a towel.  Right in front of the window, she looks out.  And she's stalked naked, bro.  Yeah. 
[00:46:00]  A lot of guys are assuming that she might be doing this on purpose, has this little exhibitionist in her.  And, you know, because she does it.  Her window is completely open.  The lights are on.  And she gets naked.  And there's buildings facing her.  It's not like she can't see this building.  This is an office building.  She has to know people are working.  Dude, but this window that I look at every morning, it's on the first floor. 
[00:46:30]  It's at a private house.  I found out from the people in the area.  Behind a fence and some hedges.  Right.  Dogs I got to get past.  And I got to look through the bars of the crib.  I found out she was a school teacher.  And this girl was a seven and a half every day.  But now that it's a little lighter out, it's a little difficult to see.  But, like, around the fall time, full-blown right in the window, bro.  That's the best viewing, right?  You ought to start viewing season.  Yeah.  Sell the address, and then people will start going there, like, lining up, like, at the Field of Dreams. 
[00:47:00]  Hey, dude, I caught a guy over there one morning doing the same thing.  I asked him what he was doing there.  He goes, nothing.  I was looking for my keys.  And you're like, I know what you're doing.  All right, Lorenzo, thank you.  Sir, what are you doing here?  You came to look at a 39-year-old girlfriend.  And think about slacks.  Dateline Predator.  Dateline Predator.  Peeping Tom DJ shock jocks.  Ralphie on Long Island. 
[00:47:30]  Ralphie.  Why the binoculars?  Is she listening to the show?  Huh?  Do you think she's listening to the show?  I don't know.  If she's listening to the show, we ask her to maybe blink her lights on and off a few times.  Oh, yeah, that's going to happen.  Even if she was listening to the show, I think she would just deny that she is.  Blink the lights on.  And if she was listening to the show, wouldn't you just say, could you just get naked and  plaster yourself against the window?  Maybe she wouldn't want to do that.  Maybe she wants to just go so far, Anthony.  Hey, how many guys do you think in that building are cranking them out there? 
[00:48:00]  What?  What?  No one.  Not in that building, sir.  No, in your building.  In our building?  I don't know.  I don't know what goes on up around here.  No one.  Look out the window.  She's not exactly Bo Derek.  I don't think every guy in the office is face first against the window cranking.  We can't really tell yet.  We haven't had the binoculars.  And we're so critical.  Someone yells out, ah, she's flat.  And then someone had to say no, man.  She's got a sports bra on.  Who blurted it out?  She's fat.  Drew says she's fat?  Oh, flat.  Oh, flat.  Ty in Georgia, what's up? 
[00:48:30]  There's a girl.  I drive up to Chattanooga from Atlanta quite a bit.  And there's this woman that drives with one titty out all the time.  Wait a minute.  I don't think that's allowed, sir.  She has one breast out all the time?  Yeah, she'll drive and you blow the horn and she'll just smile.  I took some pictures last time.  I got to get them.  And you see the same girl on the same ride?  Yeah.  And she likes to drive with one of them out.  And meanwhile, there's a baby somewhere that she forgot to pick up.  No, there's no baby. 
[00:49:00]  She's a good-looking girl.  No, I know, sir.  Rides up the road.  But I got some pictures.  I'm going to get them to go up and send them.  Stop the show.  Stop the show.  I believe she's hit one mile on the bike.  She's also reading a John Grisham novel.  Yeah, it did look like something.  Either that or some romance novel.  Stupid law book he wrote.  He stinks.  I used to like him.  Yeah.  The young lawyer who makes good.  Oh, why don't you die already?  Steve on Long Island.  20 times. 
[00:49:30]  Same book, 40 times.  Hey, Steve.  How's it going?  All right.  The Pelican sodomy.  All right.  Steve.  I'm a cop.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  Yeah?  And we used to have different blocks of classes, and we'd have our gym block.  Following that was one of our classes.  And every single morning, the same girl would be getting undressed in front of the window.  So we'd run, all the guys, we all knew this in the same class.  We'd run from our gym class to get the good seat next to the window in our behavioral science class. 
[00:50:00]  So our instructor would come in, and you'd have like 10 or 11 cops all sitting on the left side of the classroom.  And all the other cops are sitting on the, like you have two or three cops on the other side.  And they'd come in there, what the hell is going on?  People are fascinated by this, and we've talked about it before.  You can just log on to plenty of sites and pop up women of all different shapes, sizes, colors, slutty, girl next door-ish. 
[00:50:30]  It doesn't matter.  It's different when you can look through a window.  And it's a regular girl.  And it's just some girl going about her business with her clothes off.  There's something else that makes that better for some reason.  We were given the definition of peeping Tom.  Peeping Tom.  It's a noun.  A person who stealthily peeks into windows, holes in restroom walls, or other openings with a purpose of getting a sexual thrill from seeing women or girls undressed or couples making love. 
[00:51:00]  The term comes from the legendary Tom, who was the one person who peeked when Lady Godiva rode her horse naked through the streets of Coventry to protest taxes.  Being a peeping Tom is treated as a crime based on sexual deviancy.  With various names in different states, it forms the basis for a lawsuit by the victim on the basis of invasion of privacy.  Interesting.  Unless, of course, it's public display like that. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  Like the fact that we're in a place.  I think if you search it out.  If you're in a tree somewhere.  In a tree.  On private property.  You have to go out of your way.  With a golf club.  Looking at that Moxley girl.  Right, exactly.  That Moxley girl.  Oscar in Westchester.  Oscar.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good on you, man.  Better now, Oscar.  Thanks.  Hey, so what are the details on this girl across the way?  Is she taking care of herself nice and clean shape?  Well, from what we saw yesterday, I don't think, I think she's using the razor on her armpits and her legs. 
[00:52:00]  Period.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What, Steve?  She has Yahtzee.  I guess she's an average girl, though, right?  A brunette?  Very average.  She stinks.  She's just very average.  Exactly.  Plain Jane.  But this time of the morning, while we're trying to do a radio show, she's a 10 in our eyes.  She's, like, on the 10th floor on an exercise bike.  Yeah.  She's just, uh... 
[00:52:30]  Fat.  She doesn't shave.  And she's flat, and she's in a bike reading a romance novel.  She should be shot.  Let's go to Scott.  So should we.  Scott, let's go.  You got to get right in, man.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  So when I was growing up, I lived next door to my little fantasy girl.  She was big hot.  And then in high school, I found that she had a little routine when she would come home from dates.  She had a curfew, and I would time it so I would be walking the dog past her house at that time,  and she would get undressed, and she had no curtains or nothing on her windows, pitch black at night, 
[00:53:00]  and it was bright as day in there.  And I found out years later that she was doing it on purpose because she knew I was out there.  And it was my little fantasy come true.  Wow.  Would she tell you?  Did you read this in Penthouse Forum?  Yeah.  It's too perfect.  Dear Penthouse Forum.  Well, we're real good friends.  So when my sister went, she was good friends with my sister when my sister went away to college,  and she didn't.  I was home, and she and I became closer, and all that kind of came out one night when we were drinking. 
[00:53:30]  Did you hook up?  Actually, we did, yeah.  How was it?  You know, it's never as good as you imagine.  I remember I used to live next door to these two teenage girls when I was younger,  and I would try to peek at them, and they were really sexy.  And I remember I stole their panties, one girl's panties, off the laundry line.  You sicko.  I know.  That really is dear.  And then I tortured their animals.  No, I just took her underpants and put them on my face.  Unfortunately, though, I'm so dumb, I take them off the laundry line after they're clean. 
[00:54:00]  Of course.  Squeaky clean.  I should have just stolen them out of the bag before she opened them.  I'm a sexy idiot I am.  Shoplift them from the store.  The same brand she uses.  Let's go to Rowdy in Oklahoma.  Rowdy.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey, man.  All right, man.  Hey, how bad is it that we will look at the ugliest women through a window that we won't  even turn our heads to look at on the street?  That's true.  Because there's something wrong about it.  Yeah.  That's right.  Because it's just a nasty thing.  This is a dirty thing to do.  It's a dirty thing. 
[00:54:30]  It gets into your primal, the primal side of you.  The naughty, like, why do I, I like peeking up a skirt.  I love to peek up a skirt.  Peek.  But I love, I love a good, like, thigh shot up a skirt or a little panties.  Sexier than nudity to me.  Yeah.  I love it.  I mean, sometimes I'll just lay on the sidewalk and play dead while people walk over me.  Let's go to Sammy in Queens.  Sammy.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Congrats on radio history, man.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you, my friend.  Yeah.  I used to work downtown by the Seaport on Water Street. 
[00:55:00]  Mm-hmm.  Across from us, they converted an office building into NYU dormitory.  Oh.  We were on the 16th floor.  It's still there now.  How many Asians did you get to see jump to their depths?  Yeah, right.  Oh, I got to beep for us.  It's all over.  Dishonored.  It's an epidemic here in New York City.  They should just install trampolines all around NYU's campus.  Hey, if you were peeping Tom by the Seaport, it was like smell-o-vision for you.  You got that right, Anthony.  You got that right.  You scratched the window. 
[00:55:30]  A lot of fish there, boys.  A lot of fish.  Yes, we understand the joke, sir.  I just told it.  Yeah, thanks, Larry Literal.  A lot of water, sea salt.  Seaweed sometime, low tide.  So what would happen?  You'd peak?  Well, we used to sit in a conference room on the 16th floor, and we would see girls going  taking showers, walking out naked, getting banged.  After, like, school started, we would get to learn their schedule, their class schedule  for the semester.  And you would know what time of day, who's going to come out, who's going to shower, 
[00:56:00]  who has late classes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What?  She's on the phone, and she's using her anytime minutes.  Wow, Steve.  That is exciting.  That's terrific, Steve.  Thank you.  Good thing you stopped the show.  Go ahead, Sam.  It was like every day, a bunch of guys would get in the conference room, and we'd just  sit there and look out the window.  Yeah, that's a good day. 
[00:56:30]  It's insane.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Once you get a few of them, you could kind of make up names for them.  You know?  It's not fun when you just have one.  She's just the girl now.  We could do this for the rest of the morning.  We'll do a couple more, and we'll try to move on.  Charlie in New York.  Charlie.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I'm a window cleaner here in New York, and I've seen some good stuff over the years.  A window cleaner.  Wow.  Yeah, that's got to be one of those jobs where you just kind of, what, the little scaffolding  goes down, and hello.  You don't work at Show World, do you?  Well, you know, I have this one routine where I used to work in this medical building, and 
[00:57:00]  it was like a library area, and there was this one broad.  She had a routine every morning, 7.15, she'd get in the shower, and it was like a real  close-up view.  It was like directly across the street, and I had this routine where I would kind of hide  behind the aisle of the library books and kind of sneak out and just kind of sit in a chair.  And one day, I just, I went over there, and there was a guy in the shower, and he caught  a look at me, and he jumped out of the shower, and I just had this face all on, like, when 
[00:57:30]  Butthead was watching a Winger video, and it was horrible.  I haven't been back since, but that's about it.  Punch it out, guys.  Out my window, I live on the 10th floor.  I can see into the window of, like, the 8th floor apartment in front of me, like, looking  down.  And I saw one night, I can't really see much, because I have to get a telescope, because  I, like, live in a fishbowl.  There's, like, windows all over.  Yeah.  And I see, like, these, like, legs, but because I'm looking down from a top angle, you can't  see much.  Uh-oh.  And I see, like, somebody is, like, standing up. 
[00:58:00]  I can see it's a guy's legs, but I can see the motion, back, forth, back, forth, but  he's standing up.  So I'm like, no, there's another person there.  I just can't see anything.  And I never saw anything, but one time I'm looking, and I see two guys in the kitchen  talking.  I'm like, oh, Jesus.  I'm like, I hope that that's just a friend that stopped by, and not the second half of  who I scrapped to.  Just talking in the kitchen.  Oh, man.  How are you feeling?  Better?  How are you?  Oh, my God. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Let's go to Eric in Colorado.  Eric.  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  Hey.  The house behind me, the couple that live there, their bedroom window faces my computer  room window, and there's curtains on it, and regularly I get a good show from them.  The woman is a really hot Asian, and, I mean, I've watched, I've been sitting there on the  computer, I'll turn the lights out, and I'll sit there and watch them, 8, 9 o'clock 
[00:59:00]  at night, just sitting there going at it, and they know I can see them, because a couple  of weeks after I saw them the first time, I was out in the backyard doing some yard work,  and the guy came out, and he says, I hope we didn't embarrass you, but my wife's kind  of an exhibitionist.  Oh, if he's saying that to you.  Yeah, of course.  He's saying, like, watch, tune in again.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think it's as much fun if they know you're watching.  No.  It takes away from it a little bit.  No, I like the fact that she's an exhibitionist.  I like that, because she'll do more, and she'll make, she'll show more. 
[00:59:30]  I like that, if she's going to turn a certain way to show.  Oh, I like that a lot.  Yeah.  Like, let's just fear of getting caught, and you can just kind of let it all go.  Nah, it's just got to be like that.  It's got to be like that slob.  It's just down there on her bike.  Yeah, is she still doing cardio, this bitch?  I can't tell.  Club Soda Kenny's big body is in the way.  Hey, can you move that seven-foot chest king jacket?  I know, really.  What do we got over there in that window?  Just some old hag?  Just some old lady.  Oh, my God.  Her rent must be like 50 bucks a month. 
[01:00:00]  She's been there forever.  Wow.  All right, moving on to other things.  Kenny's dressed for a confirmation in 1982.  That's great.  Awful coat.  All right, why don't we do this?  Don't touch my hair.  That's what he looks like, doesn't it?  That's the only time anybody thinks I'm good is when I'm down at the disco, dancing down at 2001.  Take a lot of time on my hair, and he touches my hair. 
[01:00:30]  Hey, we got some audio from the State of the Union last night.  Let's get through this really fast.  And it looks like the president sounds drunk there.  Yeah, I don't know.  Want to take a listen?  Sounds like he was tipping a few back, maybe relax himself before the speech.  Yeah, he was talking about the immigrants and the problem we're having with that thing.  Once here, illegal immigrants live in the shadows of our society.  Many use forged documents to get jobs, and that makes it difficult for employers to verify 
[01:01:00]  that the workers they hire are legal.  Illegal immigration puts pressure on public schools and hospitals.  It strains state and local budgets and brings crime to our communities.  Communities.  He sounded a little drunk. 
[01:01:30]  Sounds a little drunk and a little digitized.  America can be a lawful society and a welcoming society at the same time.  We will fix the problems created by illegal immigration,  and we will deliver a system that is secure, orderly, and fair.  And fair.  And fair.  And fair.  And fair.  A little more Bush from last night sounding a little drunk. 
[01:02:00]  Slurred speech.  It is a way for those who have broken the law to pay their debt to society  and demonstrate the character that makes a good citizen.  We must honor the great American tradition of the melting pot,  which has made us one nation out of many peoples.  Many peoples.  Many peoples.  Demonstrate. 
[01:02:30]  Anything over there in Iraq?  She has stopped pedaling.  Uh-oh.  She is now sitting on the bike.  Uh-oh.  Is she reading?  Is she reading?  Miles?  Is she reading?  No, I'm reading.  Put the book down.  She's just trying to finish the chapter before she hits the shower.  We're in the bowl like the rest of us.  You ever read until your legs get numb?  You get off and you're like a newborn baby fawn.  Yeah.  Big kneecaps.  Legs shaking.  All chafed.  More audio from Bush last night. 
[01:03:00]  And as we work it out, all of us need to keep some things in mind.  We cannot build a unified country by inciting people to anger or playing on anyone's fears.  We're exploiting the issue of immigration for political gain.  I love that gag.  This is the best gag.  Damn, does he sound wasted.  One more.  Oh, oh.  All right, she's up. 
[01:03:30]  She's up.  She's up.  All right, going over with the binoculars.  Grab a wireless.  Grab a wireless, you pretty sweetie.  I must describe.  God damn it.  Hold on.  Anthony's looking through his binoculars courtesy of Tom C. Asano.  Where's the window?  All right, I found the window.  She is.  Oh, my God.  She's moving a piece of furniture.  This shit sucks.  Can someone get a microphone for Norton, too?  She's taking some stuff off the bed. 
[01:04:00]  She's going.  Come on.  She's got to lose the bra.  She's going back in the bathroom.  Oh, she's taking her.  I think she went into the bathroom to take her pants off.  Son.  All that waiting for her pedaling.  She's in the room.  To the right.  To the right.  What's going on in the room to the right?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  She's mixing a Metamucil.  There she is.  Okay, she's going back.  Let's see.  Don't stop in that bathroom.  You tease. 
[01:04:30]  All right.  What did she bring in?  She brought in her pocketbook.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  That's not a good sign.  Oh, boy.  You know what girls keep in their pocketbooks that they need once every month?  That's right.  Dare to dream.  And now she's disappeared on the side of the, uh, bed.  All right.  She's spinning in a circle?  Yeah, she's kind of circling.  You could barely see.  There she is.  All right.  Full view again from the back.  She's sitting down on the floor? 
[01:05:00]  Let's figure it out.  She does this thing.  She, uh, she does the ab workout against the wall.  She's doing a headstand.  She, I swear to you.  Please let her neck break.  She is doing a headstand against the wall.  Her feet are up in the air.  How funny would it be if she just fell and paralyzed herself and we just laughed instead  of calling someone?  And this is like real live call the police.  This is like real live Sims.  Steve knows her complete activity.  Why does she?  I've never seen her do this, Steve.  Yeah, she did this yesterday.  She stands on her head.  She's looking under her bed for dust bunnies. 
[01:05:30]  So she's doing her abs now?  Oh my God.  She found the Scrabblex she lost.  She's doing an ab crunch.  She's doing some crunches.  An ab crunch?  Yeah.  How do you do that with your legs up against the wall?  I've never seen this.  This is the dumbest exercise regimen ever.  Her butt's on the floor.  Her legs are against the wall up in the air and she's crunching her upper body.  Okay, the only saving grace here is with the belly she's got, you know she can't do this 
[01:06:00]  long.  Ten minutes?  Ten minutes with the ab workout?  There ain't no way.  All right.  We got to take a break, Anthony.  All right.  We'll take a break and keep an eye on this situation.  Yeah, we'll have an update when we get back.  As we go to break, some more Drunk Bush audio.  On a visit to Bethesda Naval Hospital, Laura and I met a wounded Marine named Guadalupe  Dano Han.  Dano Han came to the United States from Mexico when he was a boy. 
[01:06:30]  And then he volunteered for the United States Marine Corps as soon as he was able.  During the liberation of Iraq, Master Gunnery Sergeant Dano Han was seriously injured.  Hey, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yep.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings 6 to 9.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:07:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Anthony's next to the window.  Anything going on, Anthony?  This girl's a tease.  Anthony's been looking towards binoculars ever since we went to break.  She's been doing her ab crunches. 
[01:07:30]  What else?  She does some ridiculous headstand thing against the wall.  Then she gets up and I swear to you, as if to task us, she tasks me.  She looked like she was going to take her pants down three times.  She went for the tie in the front and everything.  And then nothing.  Now she's back in her living room area.  Okay.  She's walking now back into the bedroom.  We have a clear view into our bathroom also.  I see her toilet bowl.  Apparently, she uses scrubbing bubbles because it's spotless. 
[01:08:00]  Well, she stopped somewhere in between.  Living room.  Is she in the living room again?  But she never takes her clothes off in the living room.  What is she doing?  She's going through paperwork.  Oh, she's grabbing her pants.  She's either just scratching her butt or she's going to take her pants off.  All right.  She's done this three times.  She's adjusting her radio and now flipping us the bird. 
[01:08:30]  Jimmy, uh, Jimmy's in on the surveillance now.  She's, she's doing a lot of walking back and forth, but this is the time she always takes  her clothes off.  But for some reason, she's being a real tease.  Where is she?  I can't even see her.  She stopped in between the living room and then you got the bricks and then the bedroom.  What? 
[01:09:00]  I don't know.  If she's having breakfast, I hope she chokes on it because this is no way to treat a room  full of perverts.  No way.  Where?  Where do you see her?  No, I thought I saw a movement.  I realized, who's holding this for me?  Catherine Hepburn?  Why are my stupid binoculars not staying still?  You have to put it against the window to steady it.  It is against the window.  I should be picking blueberries and looking at loons.  Make me laugh.  It shakes.  This has completely shut down the show, by the way. 
[01:09:30]  I know.  Thank you, Tom Chiasano.  Tom got us these binoculars this morning.  He didn't realize what kind of pervs we were.  That we really are horrid human beings and we'd much rather see a naked woman that doesn't  know she's being watched.  Living room.  All right.  He doesn't realize that by next week, the bottom half of this window is going to have  an opaque covering on it.  You know what?  Night vision.  We're going to need night vision. 
[01:10:00]  That's right.  And like a helicopter like they had in Blue Thunder so we can just hover and watch.  Yeah, we can just hover with the silent rotors.  She's doing like work.  What is she doing?  Isn't she naked by now?  You got a sports bra on.  Maybe she works from home.  She's naked by now, no?  Maybe she's a...  Usually she's naked by now.  Maybe she's an author.  She's not an author.  Maybe she writes saucy material.  Dare to dream.  Wow.  Is that a laptop?  She's working on a book? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Nah, she's reading.  I've had it.  I really hate her.  You bitch.  I still want to look though.  All right.  Well, have someone just kind of take a look.  Yeah, someone's got to look then.  Interrupt the show if anything's going on over there, okay?  And not Steve.  And not Steve?  I believe she has writer's block.  She looks frustrated.  Oh, my God.  She's searching for Whiteout.  Oh, God. 
[01:11:00]  Club Sword, Kenny, you're on the job, right?  Yeah.  Kenny's on the job.  E-Rock's got to move though because at any moment...  Yeah.  There you go.  You do have a vantage point from your microphone over there.  Yeah, I got a pretty good seat over here.  I could just turn my head and kind of see if she's doing anything.  All right.  All right.  We got the cause.  The cause.  You had Danny find this?  What's going on with this thing?  Well, I was on CNN just kind of scrolling around and I see Cosby and then it has a quote.  It says, people have gone crazy. 
[01:11:30]  And it's a little audio of him being angry.  He's come out before criticizing this black culture that he doesn't appreciate the hip-hop thing  and the black-on-black crime, lack of education, he has said.  So he comes out every so often and just lambasts the black community and they call him an Uncle Tom for it.  They don't like it.  They don't like it.  They don't like it. 
[01:12:00]  Black people don't like their laundry being aired in public in front of white people.  It's a really weird thing.  And because a lot of people know he's right.  I mean, people know that he's telling the truth, but it's the fact that he's doing it publicly like that that bothers people.  Yeah, there's something that should be kept underground, you know?  It should be kept within the community, just kind of whispered, because if you get somebody as big as Bill Cosby talking about it,  then maybe someone's got to do something about it.  Drew, you're a black gentleman.  I mean, how do people look at him?  He is not, first of all.  He's barely black. 
[01:12:30]  He's black?  He's more white than black.  He's not.  I'm black enough for this room, I think.  Absolutely.  Yeah, you are really dark compared to everyone else.  If it's not you, it's Steve, who's Lebanese.  That's as close as we have.  Leave, let my people alone.  Just have some baba ganoush and pick it up with your feet.  Well, you want to hear the Cosby audio?  Let's hear a little Cos.  All right.  We're at a time when you look at numbers, and people are just throwing numbers out,  and these numbers tend to have no feeling about the incarcerated African-American male. 
[01:13:00]  But it sounds like there's not good news.  If the African-American female is looking for a love partner.  All right, hold.  Stop the president.  Stop the president.  Stop the president.  We're getting nudity.  God damn it.  I can't zero in on this room in a second.  It just takes too long.  There we go.  She is topless. 
[01:13:30]  How do they look?  They don't look bad.  Give me the...  Can someone hold the mic here?  She has now gone into that little corner by her bed.  It's not much room, so she usually pops right back out of there.  She's naked!  She has...  Oh, there are...  She's laying out some clothes, I guess.  Come on.  I'm trying to see how dark they are.  For when she gets out of the shower.  That's her closet.  I hate her OCD.  That she's going into.  But she took her sports bra off. 
[01:14:00]  So she is topless.  She's wearing these black kind of stretch exercise pants.  Yeah, complete pants.  And those are the next thing that have to go.  I'm trying to focus better.  Are they going?  Are they going?  Take them off, you almost fat lady.  Are they going?  Now, she's kind of walking into the bathroom.  Oh, I had enough of this woman.  She really is ruining the show.  Stop moping around.  She's coming back in.  She's grabbed a piece of paper. 
[01:14:30]  Why am I excited about mediocre breast walking by?  They're B-cups.  I'm looking at B-cups from across the street.  But they're...  There's nothing wrong with the small ones, Jimmy.  Hey, Tom, can you get us the Hubble so I can see these?  Stop making me laugh.  It's shaking.  All right, her boots.  All right, come on.  Lose the pants.  Here they go.  Here they go.  Here go the pants.  She is completely naked. 
[01:15:00]  Naked, naked, naked, naked, naked, naked.  She's naked.  There it is.  Nice panties.  Uh-oh.  What's going on there?  Nothing.  She needs to stay on that bike a little longer than she has been.  Exactly.  Wow.  But she's completely naked, and that's what we were waiting for.  Those panties are awful.  This is good.  It would be sexier if she just wrapped herself in a flag.  Yeah, look at that.  No, is she going into the living room naked?  I hope so. 
[01:15:30]  All right, let me move to the side.  There she is.  Look, she's in our living room naked.  Can you not rub the microphone on my chin, Uncle?  Isn't that great?  She's walking back now.  Back.  All right.  Yep.  Saw it.  Hey, pick up a razor.  Saw it.  She finally turned in the right direction for us to see full frontal.  What does she shave with?  Miracle-Gro?  Ch-ch-ch-ch-chia.  That's just putting the lotion on.  Oh, she's lotioning.  See, Jimmy, what's wrong with this? 
[01:16:00]  Nothing.  If she would get front and center, but she's in the corner like a screensaver.  She's now lotioning her body.  She's not showering today?  I don't know.  She's going to go in stinky?  It puts the lotion on.  It's bunt.  It does this when it's cold.  Fat belly.  Could you help me with this tuba lotion?  I got a broken arm.  Would you?  Nice papoosh, fatso.  You're about a size 14.  I want to go over there and carve diamonds in her back.  Make a dress out of her. 
[01:16:30]  Go for the tuck.  Oh, yeah.  Is she a great big fat person?  Look, she's hugging herself.  She's lotioning her shoulder.  Oh, I thought she did.  And now her hips.  Positive affirmations.  And now she's walking right up to the window.  Wow.  Get on the scale, puppy.  Dude, she's getting on the scale, which is right by the window.  I'm not even kidding.  Is she still wearing panties or is that something else?  Dude.  Are you kidding?  She really needs to take care of business. 
[01:17:00]  Please look across the street and see us.  South of the equator.  Please see us, tub lady from The Shining.  She's not tub lady from The Shining.  She certainly is.  I believe with that shape, she could wobble and not fall down.  She stinks.  I'd rather watch Travis naked in the little room behind us.  Again?  Tell her to up her cardio.  What is she doing?  Four minutes and then having ice cream?  You mediocre slob. 
[01:17:30]  Get dressed already so I can go sit.  I believe she's putting on some type of skirt.  Now, what's she doing?  That's great.  She's not showering.  Time on the bike and some Froot Loops and no shower.  What a lovely girl.  Maybe she's got the day off.  Maybe she's just going for newspapers.  No, she wouldn't be.  No, she's loading stuff into a black, like, bag.  She's putting some white stuff into a balloon and swallowing it.  Wow, she really does have an ample butt. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, she dropped her up.  That bend over must have looked nice from that other angle.  Oh, look at the bunt from the side.  Look at that bunt.  Wow, that is like the continental shelf.  It's like watching a giant European ant.  I want to break in and just shave her.  I don't want to risult her.  I just want to shave her.  He broke in and he shaved me.  Karen.  Karen.  It looks like a forest. 
[01:18:30]  Where is she?  Bathroom.  She's hovering.  Oh, yeah, she works out on a bike and she goes out not smelling so fresh.  She really is a filthy animal.  She's awful.  She's awful.  The elevator just smells like sushi.  Well, I think she's by her closet now.  She put some stuff in a bag.  I don't know what that means.  Is she going away, do you think?  Maybe she's going to the gym. 
[01:19:00]  Nah, she wouldn't have done bike.  Where she will work out and then shower there.  Nah, she would have done it all there.  I love the speculation.  Me too.  And it's all worthless.  She's probably going to Sloan Kettering because she has to have something removed.  My God.  Man.  I'm going to take the sexiness out of it.  What sexiness?  Like watching my mother but not quite as hot.  She's disappeared into her closet for the past about a minute or so.  How funny would it be if she hung herself? 
[01:19:30]  She's been listening to the show.  Exactly.  You just see the flash of a gun.  She's playing a Van Halen record and killing herself.  Oh, well.  Where is she?  I think she's probably in the closet getting dressed where she should be.  Exactly.  Right in front of the window.  I can't wait until she looks up and sees us and just covers her mouth and hides.  Isn't it the worst part of this whole thing is that she's the hottest girl in the building so far?  She's the only girl. 
[01:20:00]  It's either her or the old lady in the other apartment.  Yeah, you stir that sauce, you old bitch.  We're just like rooting for her.  Come on, grab that chest and fall.  Hit that medical earth button.  It's her life call.  It saved my life because the shock jocks were looking at Fatty.  We're all trying to get off watching her and her little rascal.  They never called the ambulance.  Yeah, she's gone.  No, she's in the back.  I see her.  You see a piece of her?  I do.  You've got a little bit of a better vantage point. 
[01:20:30]  Better angle.  She's walking away.  All right, you take the shot.  I can't see.  All right, the motorcade is turning left on Elm.  And she's naked.  She's got a pile of garbage all over her bed.  Yeah, she really is a mess.  She's a real, like...  Snack wrappers.  Just loading up.  Why?  She was...  Oh.  All right.  That's going to send me right back to my seat. 
[01:21:00]  I got scared.  Jimmy got all scared.  I got excited.  And nervous.  He got a nervous stomach.  When I see nervous...  When I see naked girls walking, my body reacts.  All right.  I've had it.  I'm going back to the seat.  She ain't worth the smell coming off of Jimmy.  My goodness.  Wow.  Well, that was a good first day with the binoculars.  Thank you, Tom.  Yes.  Thank you very much.  That's the only window that has action so far.  All the other windows, they're not even awake yet.  No, the shades are down or it's too dark in there.  There must be a retirement building or something because no one's getting up for work. 
[01:21:30]  Retirement from caring about how fat your body gets?  That bunt is hilarious.  That is really funny.  Don't you just want to punch it?  Yeah.  It's more than I want to breathe.  It looks like she's pregnant with a football.  Stupid, awful shape.  What are you doing, life lady, besides never drown?  She doesn't need one of those shells in the shower for the shampoo and stuff.  She just rests it on top of the bunt.  Hey, the game gum. 
[01:22:00]  We got the down in the hole.  We should play that again today.  A lot of people enjoyed that.  And I believe we have some other audio as well.  Oh, yeah.  We were doing Cosby, okay.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we were doing the Cos.  Cosby's a little angry.  Yes.  Well, let's see how to Hank Hill real fast.  Hank Hill, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hey.  How the hell are you?  Hey, buddy.  It's the guy from PalTalk.  Yeah.  Yeah, speaking of PalTalk, the only thing you guys are missing from this show looking out  the window is the little user screen names underneath everybody's window. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we're working on the PalTalk thing.  Unfortunately, it's taking longer than we thought it would.  What are you going to name this lady?  Fat Bunt Girl.  13th floor fatso.  You're on the line.  Go.  Uh-oh.  Yeah, we're working on it there, Hank.  All right, Hank Hill.  Hank.  Yeah, we should have the PalTalk camera set up in this studio within the week, I guess.  You ever hear the calls he makes on PalTalk?  He's a funny dude, man.  And Hank Hill.  Hank Hill's all right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He actually sounds just like the guy on PalTalk, yeah. 
[01:23:00]  Hey, we'll go to break with this down in the hall sung by James Gumm.  You want to explain this, Anthony?  James Gumm.  Oh, we, first of all, just love the character.  James Gumm from Silence of the Lambs.  And, um, yeah, Fatty Cycling Girl.  Is that what we're calling her?  Excuse me, why is Matt Lauer broadcasting in front of the Mona Lisa?  Uh, Da Vinci Code coming out.  Why do you have to stand in front of the painting?  Uh, because Da Vinci painted it.  It's part of the movie, I guess.  That painting sucks. 
[01:23:30]  It's a big part of it.  How do you say the Mona Lisa sucks?  She looks like E-Rock with a wig.  It's not about her beauty.  It's the subtle emotion on her face.  What emotion?  She's a fat curmudgeon.  She's a fat girl.  Look at her.  She's looking at her friend right now going, I want to leave the party, even though you  and that guy are talking.  I hate the Mona Lisa.  Wait, look behind him.  She's getting on an exercise bike and taking her clothes off.  Mona Lisa is awful. 
[01:24:00]  It's a classic.  It's a lot of excitement because of the Da Vinci Code's coming out.  So, they're in Paris.  He's got to be there in front of the painting.  Of course he has to.  In the ass he is.  Uh, James Gumm as we go to break.  Down in the hole.  James Gumm.  Down in the hole.  Where is she?  Well, uh, we never all, we also, I don't think we could ever play that on, uh, on FM radio,  but a couple of guys out in California, uh, made a Broadway musical kind of takeoff on  Silence of the Lambs and they use James Gumm's voice.  Uh, one of them does a great impersonation of the, uh, you'd think it was the real guy. 
[01:24:30]  They sing a song called Put the Effing Lotion in the Basket.  In the basket.  We play it on our XM show all the time.  Yeah.  It's much too filth ridden.  Yeah.  Uh, for, uh, regular radio.  But, uh, this is a guy singing down in the hole as James Gumm.  Yeah.  It's John S. uh, from Hartford, Connecticut.  Yeah.  Because what, where does he put his girls that he gets?  His big fat girls to lotion up their skin and get it all supple so he can make this,  the little suit out of the girls and put them on. 
[01:25:00]  Check it out.  It's John S.  Tuck.  He's tossed our holes.  He's dancing around.  Would you?  Would you?  What?  Can you help me put this in my van?  Would you?  With my broken arm, I don't think I can.  I have been guilty of murdering girls that are fat You're on my list now, what do you think

Hey guys, I want to say thank you so much for inspiring me to go to the gym today 
[01:28:00]  A little inspiration for the gym?  Yeah  Why are you talking so quietly?  Yeah  Am I talking quietly? It must be my phone  Okay  Sorry, I'll talk louder, how's that?  Much better  Where are the problem areas there, Michelle?  For me, it's my thighs  Your thighs?  Yeah  How old a gal are you?  I'm 25  25?  Yeah, you should have good thighs at 25  Why the big thighs?  Well, I used to be really, really heavy  And then I lost a lot of weight  And now I'm not really fat anymore 
[01:28:30]  But I kind of, I see it every time I look at myself  Ah, you got lasagna thighs  Oof  What happened?  What happened?  Is it just your perception of them?  Or are they really kind of meaty, your thighs?  Actually, Jimmy, you've seen me in person  Of course you have  Of course he has  Ladies and gentlemen, if you're new to this program  Any girl that calls knows Jimmy Norton  I do know Jimmy Norton  I actually, I kissed him on the head at Atlantic City on Saturday  If he doesn't remember you, you must have been a pig 
[01:29:00]  No, no, no, there was a huge line  Oh, yeah  Yeah  Yeah, Jimmy  I had a t-shirt that says Bimmel 14  Oh, I remember you, yeah  Bimmel 14, that's you?

[01:29:30]  See, that's, sure, that's what you gotta say  So she's alright, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah, she's really sexy  Alright  Bye  Thank you, Michelle  Bye, guys  And speaking of MySpace, I gotta address this  Poor Nathaniel  This is what, bands get groupies  This is what Nathaniel gets  It's a woman named Katie  Very attractive  We're holding a baby in a MySpace photo  And this is the subject  Looking to hire for stand-up  Hi, my husband and I are moving into a new home in Suffolk, North Carolina in the fall  And we're interested in hiring your services as a stand-up for our housewarming party  I know the venue is small 
[01:30:00]  But we're willing to pay cash  And your hotel and travel expenses  If interested, contact blah, blah, blah  It's not a venue, it's a living room  It's a house  It's someone's housewarming  And Nathaniel goes, how do I politely decline this?  Why would you want to politely decline this?  Because I have precious few fans, Jimmy  And I want to hold on to the ones  And you should do the gig  You should do the gig taped  It would be great for the show  Yeah, that's actually a good idea  Because I was going to say tell her to just die and hope her house burns down 
[01:30:30]  But that's probably better for the gig  She's going to fly in, right?  I somehow knew this would get wrangled into me doing this gig  Demand a lot of money in first class  They're going to fly in, they're going to give you a hotel, you should do it  And tape the gig  First class, a five-star hotel, a 24-hour room service  And then just completely verbally trash the place as soon as you get there  Demand a limousine and do six minutes and leave  And make sure you empty the minibar in the hotel  Exactly  For every expensive little thing  I say he does it 
[01:31:00]  I have to agree  And we record it  You've got to record it  You've got to tape it and record it  Yes  Housewarming party  Please wear a tuxedo  What's her name?  Katie  Katie  Then we'll be doing your housewarming  He'll do it  He'll do it  Nathaniel, how long have you been doing stand-up now?  About two years  Perfect  About two years  Pretty, pretty new to the game  Meaning he should not be doing these gigs  Yeah, he's good  He's got a natural ability and everything  He shouldn't be doing things like housewarming parties 
[01:31:30]  But we will force him to  It'll be all people in North Carolina who don't know the show  It'll be her two neighbors  Oh, everybody, he's a comedian from the Opie and Anthony show?  Well, they're in New York  They broadcast that in New York  He's so funny  He's hilarious  What was that thing you said that time?

[01:32:30]  That nobody wants to hear at a housewarming party  The guy in the neighborhood that thinks he's funny  Is going to heckle you the whole time  To get his attention  He has to do this  Oh  Hey, Inspector Gadget  The whole land  Denise in Pittsburgh, what's up?

He's a roadway. 
[01:34:30]  I say he's either a rapist or he works with steel.  We don't care.  Go ahead.  Go on.  Leave.  Leave.  I pardon you.  What's he do?  He does roadway construction.  Shut up.  Shut up.  All right.  Well, I appreciate the call.  I don't.  Thank you, guys.  Keep the good work.  We love you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  All right.  Hope you're dead before you get back to the radio.  I want to say hi to everyone that's listening to us on 93.7 K-Rock in Pittsburgh.  This is why we stink. 
[01:35:00]  This is the first nice call from Pittsburgh.  We're horrible.  Just awful.  All right.  Here we go.  We've got some dumb news banter.  And we've got to talk about the alligators.  And then who's our guest today?  Oh, a guest.  We have a guest.  We've got some dude from The Smoking Gun.  Beautiful.  Nice.  They break a lot of great stories.  Yeah.  We'll talk to him in a few minutes.  But first, it's dumb news banter.  Courtesy of Fox here in New York.  We've been asking for this from listeners.  If you have any dumb news banter, please send it in. 
[01:35:30]  Where they try to improv.  Whenever they improv.  They go off the teleprompter and just cannot improv.  Yeah.  We're looking for that.  And, of course, news teases.  And you could email it to Danny.  I forget Danny's email.  Hello exactly at Gmail.  He's one of those Gmail people.  At Gmail.com.  Hello exactly at Gmail.com.  Of course.  And put something about your genital size and shape in the subject heading. 
[01:36:00]  That way he'll know what it is that's in the email.  Oh, yeah.  And a picture attached.  Some sort of a picture.  If you're a white gentleman, that's fine.  But Danny prefers a black gentleman.  I'm going to throw that out there.  All right.  That'll let him know.  Here's some dumb news banter from this morning here in New York City.  Yahoo.com getting a new look this morning.  The popular search engine overhauling its home page.  Adding some new features.  The redesigned page reduces the need to click through other pages to check things like your email.  Whether, you know, listen to music.  Stuff like that. 
[01:36:30]  Yahoo's last makeover was in 2004.  I remember when Yahoo first came out, Mike, oh so many years ago.  And I just thought it was a fun thing to say.  Yahoo.  Yahoo.  Yeah.  And it was a company.  Now I say Yahoo.  I don't even bat an eye.  I was thinking chocolate milk stuff or something.  But that's something else.  I like that.  Is that you who?  You who, Yahoo.  Same thing.  Yeehaw.  It's early in the morning.  It's only 525.  We're just getting going here.  Actually, this is one of those forecasts.  Oh.  Wow.  Too many people cheered about. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Thank you Lord.  Sometimes I would just say Yahoo.  And then I realized we're in the media.  So I say, controlled by Jews.  And then I would see Blackstown go, Jigaboos.  It's just awful.  Yahoo, you who.  When I hear this broadcast, I think, P-U.  P-U.  Awful. 
[01:37:30]  Awful is this?  That is horrid.  He's trying to cover for her bad improv and he's worse.  Yeah, it's early in the morning here.  It's like Yoo-Hoo.  You know when you're sick?  Just stick to the script.  The second they go off that teleprompter.  It's awful.  Over, Jamie.  I remember when Yahoo came out.  Do ya?  Really?  I was sent a file and it said horse and lady, so I opened it and it was an EXE file and I  got a virus.  Yahoo!  Let's say hi to Laura in New Jersey. 
[01:38:00]  Laura.  Yes.  Hey, Laura.  Hi.  How are you doing?  I just wanted to let you know that the commissioner of hockey is on Imus right now and Imus is  totally confused why the Stanley Cup is in his studio.  Well, why the hell isn't the Stanley Cup in our studio?  I asked Joel Hollander for the Stanley Cup.  We want the Stanley Cup so we can break it.  Oh, my God.  There it is.  Start showing us some respect around here.  Joel Hollander gave us a dumb 10-inch Stanley Cup on, what, Friday was it? 
[01:38:30]  What did he say?  Show it to Ed?  Oh, you weren't here for the Stanley Cup that was presented to us.  No.  It was symbolic.  To make us work harder.  What was the note that said, it said, just like Mark Messier promised in 1994, you guys  will be on a lot more radio stations or something like that.  Yeah.  And it turns out that Mark Messier never said that.  And then he gives us a 10-inch Stanley Cup that's-  With a devil's logo on it.  A devil's logo and it's autographed by a New Jersey devil.  And I'm like, I'm an Islander fan.  He's got it all messed up.  He's got a Ranger quote that's not right.  He's got a 10-inch Stanley Cup trophy signed by a New Jersey devil. 
[01:39:00]  You were very angry.  And I said, it's Joel Hollander and it's the thought that counts.  And I threw his thought right in the garbage.  And Ovi throws it.  And then demanded that the actual Stanley Cup be brought in here to make up for it.  That's right.  And I'm still waiting for the Stanley Cup.  And as we look over on MSNBC, Don Imus has the Stanley Cup on his show with the commissioner.  How did that happen?  Imus doesn't even know what hockey is. 
[01:39:30]  Well, I think that they got the show confused.  Well, that's what I'm thinking.  Because they're a Stanley Cup in my studio.  Yeah, you know he's not appreciating that.  And why is Opie and Anthony getting a call from Senator D'Amato?  They're kind of, they screwed up.  They screwed up the two shows here.  Gary Bessman is the NHL commissioner.  I'm just not a hockey fan. 
[01:40:00]  I wish I was.  Hockey is just the greatest sport to watch.  Well, you kind of want to see the Stanley Cup, right?  I would see it if it was here.  Is it kind of cool?  You don't want to see the Stanley Cup?  It's the greatest trophy in sports.  Name another trophy that's bigger than the Stanley Cup.  No way.  The Heisman.  The trophy I won when I was young.  It looks silly.  He's turning a wacky way.  A murderer won it.  Yes.  Is he running?  Is he a dancing homosexual?  You can't tell what the Heisman trophy is.  You can't tell.  So he's fussy hands.  It's the greatest trophy in sports.  When I was a kid, I won trophy. 
[01:40:30]  I won boy voted most likely to brighten your day.  My mother gave me that under a porch.  All right.  Well, I just has the Stanley Cup, and we got a 10-inch replica last week.  I'd like to look at the Stanley Cup and then give it back to them with what appears to be a Snickers bar in it.  There you go.  Now, Commissioner, who's this Stanley guy with this deal?  You know that's what he's got to be asking him.  What's that made out of? 
[01:41:00]  Can I put my brother's salsa in there?  Shut up, stupid.  Stanley Cup.  It should be Ben's Cup.  It would be bigger.  Awful interview.  We want the Stanley Cup in this studio.  Pronto.  Why don't we have it?  Huh?  Why don't we have it?  We should have it today.  If they have it over there, bring it over here.  I just didn't ask for it.  We asked for it.  We did.  We got a dumb plastic one that was 10 inches high. 
[01:41:30]  I want to be naughty.  I want to take the Stanley Cup and put it on my head like a hat and make everybody laugh.  Not only do I want the Stanley Cup here, Anthony, I want to be able to walk it all the way to the XM Studios.  I don't think you get to do that.  We do the walk every morning.  I want to walk with the Stanley Cup.  Make that happen.  Not in the rain.  Make that happen.  Hold it over your head.  I want Mariano Rivera's hemorrhoids.  You know he's got them.  He has to.  He has to.  He's from Panama.  He probably flies home every few weeks to see people.  So you're sitting in the seats a lot. 
[01:42:00]  More flights.  Yeah.  More baseball players and hemorrhoids.  Hey, it's all about the alligators.  Let's get this over with.  They got details about the alligator attacks in Florida.  It's a blanket statement there.  No kidding.  That's why Maguire retired.  It was the roids.  They were killing them.  Not steroids.  Hemorrhoids.  Stupid Faye Vincent.  My book.  Yeah, I'm sure it's fantastic.  Well, guys.  Shut up.  Well, guys.  Well, guys.  Put your right on your swollen prostate.  Look, man.  Back in the 30s, bro. 
[01:42:30]  Look, we've turned the corner.  We're starting to get better guests on our show.  Let's keep it that way.  I like Faye.  Nice name, girl.  Sometimes we've got to take a boring interview to get the other ones on.  Didn't King Kong carry you up there, Faye?  Faye Ray.  Oh, whatever it is.  Commissioner of Baseball, Faye Ray.  Ah!  All right.  I could go into a few other jokes, Sam.  Let's do this.  Let's do the alligator attacks, okay?  I'm scared.  It's all about the alligator attacks in Florida. 
[01:43:00]  And they found the one alligator that did what it's supposed to do and eat people.  And they decided it needs to die.  Yeah, of course it does.  It needs to die because, you know, you can't have alligators eating people.  It should have known in that walnut-sized brain not to hurt people.  It just knows.  Listen to the details about the first two attacks.  Ugh.  Gross.  As menacing as they are, alligators have rarely killed people.  That is the stuff of fiction.  Until now.  Three people killed by alligators in just the last few days here in Florida. 
[01:43:30]  On Saturday, trappers captured and killed this alligator that they say is responsible  for the death of a 28-year-old woman near Fort Lauderdale.  Medical examiners say the gator attacked her while she was on land and dragged her body  into the canal.  And this gator is a large gator.  He's probably close to 10-foot range.  Back in 1970, the federal government placed gators on the endangered species list.  They have come back with a vengeance.  Today, it is estimated there are between one and two million alligators in this state. 
[01:44:00]  Another of them attacked and killed a 43-year-old woman by a canal north of St. Petersburg over  the weekend.  Investigators are still searching for that alligator.  We are trying to catch an alligator that has become accustomed to people.  And there's a public safety issue here.  Have you been to Florida lately?  Yes.  When we were off the air, I went down to Florida and I was playing golf with Rich Voss.  They've given up as far as the alligators go because there's so many down there. 
[01:44:30]  We were on a golf course where the alligators were just hanging out on the side of the right  off the fairway.  Really?  They just can't.  There's just, like they said, one to two million alligators down there.  They used to be really careful where they were building and stuff.  But now it's just like, eh.  Well, they put them on the endangered species list years ago and they came back.  And they're really, I don't think anyone does much gator hunting, do they?  How about you club it with a bat and make a purse?  Well, we have...  Right there on the golf course. 
[01:45:00]  Just smash the dumb 10 million-year-old head.  I bet you'd get in big trouble for that.  We have audio of an old lady.  She protected herself with a garden hose.  You're kidding.  An alligator was attempting to attack and she took her garden hose.  With a garden hose?  And just started beating the animal.  God, it should have eaten her.  The third alligator death, a 23-year-old woman killed at a lake near Gainesville.  Her friends managed to pull her out of the jaws of the alligator, but it was too late.  74-year-old Connie Gittles could have been a fourth victim, but she got lucky. 
[01:45:30]  She felt something bite her while she was gardening, looked down, saw a gator, and started hitting it with her garden hose.  And I got him right on the nose.  One whack.  I don't know where he went, but he was gone.  All of this should not be surprising.  The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission reports that nuisance complaints about alligators have more than doubled in the last 20 years,  from 7,000 in 1984 to more than 18,000 in 2004.  And they say the reason is simple. 
[01:46:00]  More and more people are building right in the heart of alligator habitat.  The funny thing is the way she said she was gardening, and then all of a sudden I felt something bite my leg.  What did you go?  What is that?  Oh, wait, wait.  Oh, 10-foot reptile.  Yeah, she didn't see the thing coming or hear it.  That's not the way an alligator should affect you.  You shouldn't just notice it biting you.  Yeah, I think something's nibbling on me.  Oh, that's right.  It's a dinosaur.  It's just nibbling on me.  I'll hit him with the hose.  Maybe the hose isn't what chased him away. 
[01:46:30]  Maybe the fact that you taste like graham crackers, that she crunches like nothing, Jimmy.  You're going to help me?  I was trying to.  I knew you were finished.  You knew where I wanted to go?  No, but I knew you were.  I was actually going for an incontinence joke.  That's funny.  And I couldn't find it.  It tastes like popcorn.  Believe me, that's accurate.  Okay.  Well, only certain people know that.  Mr. Torrance on instant feedback.  Ope, you liberal man, you.  First of all, I'm not liberal by any stretch of the imagination. 
[01:47:00]  The croc was doing what it was supposed to do.  Well, so were the humans who killed it.  Stop with the whole we are such hypocrites man angle.  I'm all for alligators eating humans.  Sorry about that.  But the goddamn hypocrites got nothing to do with it.  It's alligators.  Where's Sheriff Brantford?  Look, if an alligator is able to eat a human, let it live.  That's all I'm saying.  Let it live.  Why do you have to kill the animal because it's doing what it's supposed to do?  Well, I say meat is murder.  Because we're building into their habitats, we have to destroy the alligators. 
[01:47:30]  I say if you want to build near their habitats, God bless you.  But if you get eaten by an alligator, the alligator lives.  That's all.  It's got a taste.  Well, how about this thing?  And a taste for the humans.  The alligators just learn to mind their P's and Q's.  Why can't we just tell them that?  Exactly.  Leave the old lady alone.  She's gardening.  You know, the mother nature is cyclical, right?  We've seen it with the deer population.  The bald eagle once extinct.  And now, of course, it's flourishing.  But they don't pose the same danger to people.  No. 
[01:48:00]  We don't pay as much attention, perhaps.  Not the kind of thing you want to see in your backyard.  Yeah.  And I have friends who live in Orlando.  And one friend in particular, she lives along that chain of lakes there.  I said, do people swim here in the lake?  And they do.  Their homes are on the lakes.  And they jet ski.  And you wouldn't find me in there.  Me neither.  No.  And so they're keeping a close eye there.  That must have been a fascinating conversation.  No kidding.  Where you said, do people swim there?  Well, yeah.  I mean, there's homes there.  And they jet ski.  Did you hang up then?  Or did you laugh that one off after? 
[01:48:30]  I said to my friend, did you?  And news reporters should never say that.  Yeah.  According to my friend.  Yeah, you're a news reporter.  Should be more than your friend as the source.  What else did Ethel say as she was hanging laundry?  Who are you, Richard Johnson from the Post?  And did you see what the alligator was wearing?  Bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip, bip.  Gossipy Gertie.  Oh, you stupid broad job doer.  Why don't you cook some dinner for your husband and put rollers in your hair? 
[01:49:00]  Faggot.  You're still on the Richard Johnson thing.  He makes me sick.  You stupid girl's job.  Here you go.  Here's the lady.  Oh, he went to journalism school.  Page six, New York Post gossip column.  Oh, he likes our gossip.  With Richard Johnson.  With Richard Johnson.  Wow, it's shocking.  Where Howard?  Love for Rosie.  No, that wasn't an optical illusion.  It no boo over the weekend.  It was Howard Stern and the longtime butt of his wrath, Rosie O'Donnell dining together. 
[01:49:30]  Wow.  Wow.  This Richard Johnson really gets the skinny.  He gets the skinny on things.  He's dishing.  This guy makes me sick.  Do a man's job.  And now I think she's great and I like her honesty now.  The shock jock cooed on his serious radio show.  They love the word cooed in that column.  I actually agree with that.  Everyone's cooing. 
[01:50:00]  Cooing.  Or canoodling.  I told you one of my regrets was trash.  And Rosie, I like how honest she is now.  The fact that she's...  Really?  Yeah.  One of your regrets.  No, I mean, as you say things sometimes, you're like, I wish I hadn't said that.  That's very rare.  I feel like...  What did you say?  The first episode of Tough Crowd.  Yeah.  Where Janine Garra...  What is Jim Norton wearing?  I can't wait till that's on page six.  Ugh!  Die, you faggot.  I was on the first episode of Tough Crowd.  We had, at the end, in our act, Floyd had to issue a fatwa.  A fatwa.  A fatwa, which is an Islamic death sentence. 
[01:50:30]  Yes, of course.  And Janine Garofalo, of course, issued a piece, a non-violent one, you know, because  why do something for comedic value when you can make a non-poignant statement?  So the one I issued was towards Rosie O'Donnell, and it was relatively brutal.  Yeah.  And I look back on it, I kind of feel like a goose, because...  What did you say?  I don't remember.  We'll get the audio.  Yeah, I have it.  I'll never be friends with her.  Oh, I have it.  Could you bring the audio in?  Sure.  But I had met her once before, and she was actually very nice to me.  I kind of wish I hadn't done that.  I never want you being friends with her. 
[01:51:00]  Oh, no.  I like the fact she's brutal now.  She's really brutal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's completely changed her tune.  Certainly has.  Yeah.  Do you want to call it a tune?  It used to go...  It used to be...  Now it's...  It's a much different tune.  It's now...  That's good.  I did the same joke twice.  I don't know why I did that whole words full time.  Because you used actual music the first time.  It was a tune.  Yeah.  All right.  About the second time.  If you get one last, you might as well get two.  Give me those ribs.  Let's go to Cheryl in Florida before we take a break. 
[01:51:30]  Elbow.  We got to get William Bastone in here, the editor of The Smoking Gun.  Hey, Cheryl.  Cheryl.  Stop listening to you.  Stop listening to the radio.  We're on a delay.  Okay.  Just talk on the phone, Cheryl.  Yeah.  What's going on?  Nothing.  I was just wondering, you know, like how you say you're not liberal, but then you agree  with alligators eating people.  I agree.  He is, right?  Am I right or wrong?  He's like that.  No.  Aren't the conservatives more for alligators eating people? 
[01:52:00]  No.  How is this a political thing?  Alligators have the right to, you know, explore territory and eat whatever they fucking want  to.  Language.  What type of talk is that for a boring woman?  Her phone almost dumped out of her anyway.  I think animals should eat people because, I mean, let's be real.  How many people are that important out there?  Yeah.  And let's be honest, Cheryl.  We always say on this show that we're not as important as we think we are.  You know, humans have just invaded the animal kingdom, Cheryl. 
[01:52:30]  How do you feel about that?  Yeah, man.  No, I totally agree with you, but that is so liberal.  That is the...  It's not liberal, but the trees have a right to live, too.  And if I have to fight to save one tree, I will.  We're going to live in a tree this summer that they want to chop down.  How do you know a vegetable doesn't make a sound when you're bite down on it?  That's right.  You're anti-liberal.  That's right.  You know, if you're the complete opposite from liberal, then you're conservative.  And that is not conservative.  Yes, it is. 
[01:53:00]  And, like, being pro-animal and helping...  I'm not completely pro-animal.  Are you saying conservatives aren't pro-animal?  Have you seen Republican women?  Shut up, Cheryl.  Who cares?  It's scary.  Shut up, Cheryl.  Did you have a friend eaten by an alligator?  Oh, maybe that's it.  How about the good way?  Too close to the phone.  She was dating it.  No, but I haven't been by a dog.  That doesn't mean I'm going to kill every dog in the nation.  Well, why not kill the dog?  No, I love animals. 
[01:53:30]  Because we've decided dogs are more important than alligators.  Absolutely.  They're cuter.  That's why.  No.  They're furry.  Yeah, the famous Dennis Leary bit.  We only kill the, what, the ugly animals?  Any animal that puts his nose in your crotch, you have to love.  No, all animals have equal rights.  Andy, why don't you talk to Cheryl?  Hey, you ever hear of Natural Selection?  If we're hanging out where the alligators are and they want to eat us, let them eat us.  But if we can kill them while they're trying to eat us, hey, we win.  There you go.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah, I did not hear any of that.  And by the way, Mr. Torrance has written back on instant feedback, tell this dumb whore 
[01:54:00]  to stop defending my position.  I was just busting Opie's balls.  Yeah, he was breaking in the balls and right away he's getting fresh.  Goodbye, Cheryl.  Thank you for spoiling everything.  Goodbye, Cheryl.  Good day, you woman.  We shouldn't be so mean to our listeners.  Cheryl, are you...  Oh my goodness.  We're sorry.  Cheryl, Cheryl, I like you and I enjoyed your opinion.  I was saying that you were right.  Yeah, I know.  Cheryl, we're a little cranky because we're all gay. 
[01:54:30]  I guess so.  And you haven't had your coffee, apparently.  Oh, it's almost like...  It reminds me...  I have a t-shirt that says, get out of my way until I've had my coffee.  Yay.  Yeah.  And he means it.  Yeah, I've seen you driving down the road.  Yeah.  Well, where have you seen me? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  Thanks for putting everyone to sleep there, Cheryl.  Yeah, down the road.  Where are you from, Cheryl?  Port St. Lucie.  Oh, Florida.  Oh.  Oh, yeah, yeah, Florida.  Cool.  Why don't you put chum on your face and go hang out by the canal?  That's mean.  What, you guys are based in Florida?  Yeah, we are.  Yeah, we're on...  Yes, Orlando.  Yeah, we're at the...  Studios here.  We're at the...  We're at K...  Right here at the...  We're at 103.1 The Buzz, of course, right here in West Palm. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, you don't know where you are.  Is that where you're listening to us?  Hey, Cheryl, if you die, will anyone care?  We love you, Cheryl.  I hope an alligator eats you, but only your voice box.  I'm going to do a call back to the beginning of the show.  Cheryl dies in the middle of the night.  Oh.  No one's phone's ringing.  That is not the...  No one's getting woken up.  We're teasing.  Cheryl, we don't mean it.  Cheryl, tell your friends about us.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, don't be... 
[01:56:00]  Now, don't be that way.  What way is that?  Talking, I mean.  Shut up.  No, yeah.  Actually, you know, it'd be a lot more funny if I could hear what you guys were saying.  Well, we figured with the phone, that would help communicate.  What do you do?  Do you hold the earpiece away from you and talk into the mouth thing?  Wait for a teletype, stupid...  No, I'm trying to look at the, like, two and three of you all at once here.  See?  See?  We're all talking through the same earpiece.  It's called a gang up.  That's right.  We think you stink, and we're going to let you know every way possible. 
[01:56:30]  And if you were here, it would be a gang something else.  Oh, wow.  In ball, do you?  Yeah, no, no.  Cheryl, please.  I doubt you have the ability.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Wait, what ability, Cheryl?  The ability to satisfy her in any way whatsoever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cheryl, we got to go.  We got William Bastogne.  Cheryl, thank you for listening, and please tell your friends about our program.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, conservatives. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, right, yeah, yeah.  What's your favorite radio station?  Shut up.  Shut your Edward G. Robinson mouth, stupid.  You know, I don't know.  We are really late.  We got to take a break.  We got William Bastogne standing by from the smoking gun.  We'll talk to him next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America, including West Palm Beach.  Opie and Anthony, these guys thrash hard.  Come on. 
[01:57:30]  No.  Opie and Anthony.  Mornings 6 to 9.  Brown starfish from Long Island on the instant feedback.  Opie and Anthony, these guys thrash hard.  And then he writes, probably the gayest promo I've ever heard.  Almost embarrassing.  When we went to break, we had this promo or sweeper that says, Opie and Anthony, these 
[01:58:00]  guys thrash hard.  Right.  And then, what, we got Sam going, uh, yeah.  Right?  And the guy thinks it's the real deal.  We're goofing.  We're goofing.  It's a joke, you dummy.  It's, it's, it's a joke on promos, like old school monster truck commercial.  Right.  And old school radio promos that used to take themselves seriously.  Aw, he didn't get it.  No, he didn't.  Aw, that's cute.  Some people don't get it.  He's a character. 
[01:58:30]  We got William Bastogne in studio.  Bastogne?  Yeah.  I said it right.  Nice.  I rarely see the.  What?  Get his mic up.  It's up.  Oh, goody.  Hey, William.  Hi, how are you?  How you doing, man?  He's up.  He's up and rolling.  From the smoking gun, of course.  Yeah, I love the smoking gun dot com.  A lot of, uh, scandal comes out on there.  A lot of people learn things on that one.  Right?  Yes.  What did we learn?  And, uh, was the Pat O'Brien thing broken on that? 
[01:59:00]  Uh, no, we've done.  Oh, damn it.  No, that was.  It was broken on our show.  Yeah, that was, uh, his competitor.  Thanks for.  Do you have a competitor?  Jesus.  No, not really.  Everyone goes to the smoking gun.  Actually, we were the first to have the Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  Yeah.  Oh, did you?  Because we do the satellite radio show, we were able to play them uncensored.  Ah, uncensored.  Well, everyone else in, uh, you know, terrestrial commercial radio, whatever, they, they had to  play a very, uh, uh, bleeped version of it.  Yeah, how much fun was that?  You had the Bill O'Reilly, though.  Yeah, we were the people who, um, posted the complaint against Bill O'Reilly. 
[01:59:30]  We had a lot of fun with that.  Let me ask you, that Bill O'Reilly stuff, that didn't sound like just quotes.  That sounded like transcripts because of the way, like, well, a little speech thing.  Did you guys hear any audio on that?  No, we, well, we know that she recorded him.  There's definitely tapes.  There is a tape.  Yeah, but he settled that thing out of court.  He wrote her a check and probably, you know, in, in instances like that, he got the tapes  back.  Ah.  So, they're probably been shredded someplace.  Why would she take copies?  Ah, I think there's a copy.  There's another copy.  Like a serial killer, he just keeps it around his house like a trophy, plays it every so 
[02:00:00]  often.  I can't destroy this.  It's wonderful stuff.  Listen to me.  She has one.  Well, I think if, if it ever surfaced, she would probably be liable to pay back the money.  I'm sure that's part of the deal is you, you, you're giving us the copy and if anything  ever gets played ever, you're in big trouble.  It's so odd you would think that whatever the settlement was, she could get more money  just selling it because, you know, it's Bill O'Reilly.  Well, I think a lot of people might be concerned about stepping on his toes and stepping on 
[02:00:30]  foxes.  You'll be blackballed there.  Ah, he's an ass.  The guy's just an ass.  He really is a pompous boob.  Apparently, well-endowed, though.  I respect that.  He went after our show because it was all about sex, he said.  All about sex.  Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex.  Edited our appearance on that show to make it sound like we were just perverts, basically,  even though we talked for over an hour about some very intelligent things.  And then this comes out, it just made us very happy.  Yeah, well, he's a total hypocrite and, you know, you only have to read the thing.  It actually was the most popular thing we've ever put on the site. 
[02:01:00]  I don't doubt it.  You know, it runs, the best stuff we do is stuff that we put on the site that kind of  runs counter to the subject's public, you know, persona and stuff they don't want anyone  to know about.  I think they did a little thing on us, by the way.  Didn't you have the audio of the Sex for Sam incident that was posted on there for a  while?  Guilty as charged.  Yeah, that's where a lot of people got it.  And then they trashed us pretty good on the website, too.  It kind of cleared us, though, because it showed that nothing really went down.  It was kind of, you know, dull. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah, well, we didn't really follow it too much after that, but it was, you know, entertaining  for a few days.  Not for you guys, but...  For two years.  There was some entertainment value to it.  Jesus.  And the site got hit, what, 75 million times in January?  So it's still rocking.  Yeah, we did a story on the guy, James Fry, who did the book, A Million Little Pieces.  I read the book.  Yeah, that thing came apart on him.  I read the book, and I was questioning all sorts of stuff.  I'm glad all that came out.  Why'd you read that?  Because, you know...  Because Oprah recommended it?  No, no, no. 
[02:02:00]  Jesus.  I think I read...  Did I read it before Oprah?  I'll be honest.  I'm not sure.  But no, there was a buzz on it, and I tried to read.  I tried to do some of that reading.  You're stuck up.  And it's...  You know, the reviews on the book were unbelievable, and I read it, and I thought it was unbelievable,  but then I started questioning all sorts of things myself.  Yeah.  Like, is dentistry without any Novocaine?  Getting root canals without Novocaine?  I'm like, come on.  What dentist in his right mind would do this?  None.  And that's what piqued my interest. 
[02:02:30]  Like, wow, something's not right about this book, and sure enough, it all came out, and  now he's just a disaster, and he might as well start boozing, because his life is over.  Booze it up.  Yeah, he lost his movie deal.  He lost his deal with the book company.  No more books for him.  But you never know.  Look where we are.  Yeah, he only has to fall back on, like, the $15 million he's earned, so it's a little rough.  Good point there.  Good point.  So you guys broke the fact that he was lying?  Yeah, well, we did essentially, we read the book and realized that the book was, to us, 
[02:03:00]  was unbelievable.  There were things in it that, you know, we didn't think were truthful, but what we focused  on were the things that you could figure out whether they were true or not, didn't rely  on just his words.  So that ended up being things that documents would have been attached to, police reports,  rap sheets, you know, any kind of incident reports.  And basically, we gathered up all that information, and basically you found out his account of  his life was directly contradicted by the actual records of it.  And once you start calling into question the things that you could kind of verify, why 
[02:03:30]  would you believe anything else the guy says if it relies on his word alone?  Were there any things that you got across the table and you went, eh, no?  From time to time, I mean, we're not too interested in, you know, we don't do gossip, so everything  we do revolves around us obtaining a document so that you can visit the time.  Or audio from the same patch.  Not really editorializing.  A lot of people are pointing out that the Smoking Gun has called you guys moronic shock  jocks and was in favor of you guys getting fired. 
[02:04:00]  No.  In favor?  I don't know if we were ever, I don't think we've ever come out and get people fired.  I mean, we may have written the moronic thing.  Yeah.  Hey, it was moronic.  We're the first to admit that.  It was also clever.  Really?  Was it?  Well.  So you started the Smoking Gun?  Yeah, I'm one of the three founders.  We started it in 1997, so we're heading towards our 10th anniversary.  And the sites actually started out as a side project. 
[02:04:30]  I was a reporter at the Village Voice here in New York and kind of grew into something  rather big.  And now we have, like, a pretty big audience.  Sued yet?  We've been sued one time.  Successful?  Actually, it's pending, but we think it's going to get kicked out.  Can you talk about what it is?  Yeah.  We did a story about a woman who, for a period of time, we did a fair number of stories around  reality television.  And then we kind of got a little sick of it.  And we did a story about a woman who was kind of like the in-house psychiatrist or psychologist 
[02:05:00]  for a show called The Swan.  Right.  It was a makeover show.  Remember that one.  Anyway, we did a thing about her credentials.  At lack thereof.  Well, she, you know, we contend that she got her degree from a less than reputable kind  of university of higher learning or something, kind of a mail order college.  And she's kind of saying, well, it really wasn't kind of a degree mill, a diploma mill. 
[02:05:30]  So we're fighting about that, but we don't, there's not a lot of wiggle room.  And if we get a police report or we get your mug shot or there's a lawsuit, we're just  putting it on the mug shot page is great.  A lot of people you'd never expected looking awful.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  It's us.  It's kind of like when a famous, it's like the one time a famous person gets their photo  taken and they don't have like a stylist.  Right.  Right.  A manager there.  It's kind of like, well, this is what they actually look like.  Yeah.  Really bad.  35 Coronas.  The FBI sex tour site. 
[02:06:00]  Uh-huh.  What's that about?  They gave us a few things that we might want to bring up.  Yeah.  We did a story a couple of days ago.  It's on the front page of the site.  The FBI, as they do fairly frequently, arrested a guy who's involved in kind of one of these  international kind of like sex tours when you're, you know, you want to go and do whatever  with like a 14 year old in Guatemala.  Go to Thailand or something.  Right.  Thailand.  Other places.  Vietnam.  Anyone going to Vietnam is not going there to crawl around in box holes. 
[02:06:30]  Let me check out.  There's a, there's a.  Ho Chi Minh City.  There are people, let's just say, they, they like to talk to us about their trips to Vietnam.  I'm like.  Yeah.  Who do you think you're fooling?  Wonderful.  You're going there to, to what?  To see how small the foxholes really were?  The crawl space.  Are you?  Are you really?  Looking for hidden POW camps?  Yeah.  Stop.  You know why you're going there.  Yeah.  But anyway.  So we did a story about, um, one of the things the FBI did was they set up this undercover  website, this fully operational website that they use to lure in people. 
[02:07:00]  People who they were trying to convince to take these sex tours to Thailand and other  places.  So we did a story about, they, they arrested a guy and in the reading of the documents,  we realized this, this site is up there.  So we've done a story about that.  So we kind of like, we'll do things that are kind of silly, kind of strange crime, celebrity  stuff.  Um, so it's kind of like we have a, we're just a three person staff, but we have a pretty  wide.  That's it?  Yeah.  We have a pretty wide array of interests. 
[02:07:30]  So if it, we find it funny or interesting, it finds a way onto the site.  Best celebrity scandal in your opinion?  Um, I don't know.  I mean, I, you know, we've done a lot of them, but I gotta, I have to, this thing that's  going on with Charlie Sheen and.  Oh yeah, this is good.  I'm not a particular big fan of either one of them, but she filed, which she, you know,  she filed a document a little less than a month ago.  That is one of the most unbelievable page turners, like in our site's history.  Like it's not usual, you know, it's not often that we'll post like a 17 page document and 
[02:08:00]  there'll be dead spaces in it.  But I couldn't stop reading this thing.  And it's just, it keeps going.  And you realize, you know, if like 50% of it is true, it's like the greatest document  ever published.  What thing is that?  What thing?  This is Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards.  With the phone transcript.  Yeah.  The C words being thrown around.  Oh, like crazy.  My favorite one is she talks about at some point as the thing's falling.  apart.  She like, he comes back to the house and goes into the garage where they have like  a four foot by six foot wedding framed wedding photo. 
[02:08:30]  Right.  And he takes like a saw and he saws it in half.  But before that, he writes like dumb, he spray paints dumbest day of my life on the photo  and then saws it in half.  Nice wedding picture.  Yeah.  By the way, that's filled with tidbits like that.  By the way, the listeners will not let it go.  Vincent from the Bronx.  Tell me again.  He called the stunt moronic August 23rd.  We don't usually agree with the Catholic League, but moronic shock jocks Opie and Anthony  got just what they deserved for broadcasting last week's stunt involving the Virginia couple 
[02:09:00]  arrested for having sex in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  I'm telling you, man, we got pests all over the place.  They watch out.  Oh, well, what are you going to do?  It was moronic.  Any skeletons in the closet that you're afraid might end up on a website for yourself?  Me personally?  Yeah.  No.  You got to keep pretty clean if you run a site like this.  Oh, yeah, no, I think there's three of us who have never been arrested.  You don't drive after a couple of drinks?  I don't even drive. 
[02:09:30]  No?  No, I'm a New Yorker.  I take the subway.  I don't drive yet.  No, I'd be...  Do you laugh all the way to the subway?  Remember from yesterday?  Nice call back.  Did you hear about that?  There's a huge scandal, actually, and no one's going to cover it.  It's about the Stress Factory in New Brunswick.  Oh, jeez.  Because I'm doing a gig there on Memorial Day weekend, and there was a whole big conflict.  There's no conflict.  That was Memorial Day weekend?  Yeah.  It's a shameless plug.  We'll look into that.  You stink.  Well, we got to wrap up the first half of the Opie and Anthony show.  You want to do some more over at XM?  It's up to you. 
[02:10:00]  Where we can talk and use the F word.  Or you can run away.  I wouldn't blame you.  Why don't you come with us?  We'll all talk and get to know each other.  It's William Bistone from The Smoking Gun, and we got to get out of here, I guess.  Yeah, we got to go over and do our other half.  Yeah, we're going to be broadcasting live.  What we do is we leave here, we meet in the lobby, they give us wireless mics, and then  we start broadcasting live exclusively on XM, all the way over to the XM studios.  Yesterday, by the way, a city bus driver stopped and gave us a ride that lasted 100 feet in 
[02:10:30]  the rain.  Nice guy.  All right, William, thanks for stopping by today.  Thank you so much.  Thanks, Joe.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America, and we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Thanks for checking us out today.  Ladies and gentlemen, it's the Opie and Anthony Show, radio to the power of rock.  Sounds exciting.  Opie and Anthony mornings. 
[02:11:00]  Ah, another crappy day in New York City.  Oh, when is spring going to spring?  We have to walk in the rain once again today.  Amen.  It's a shitty day, by the way.  No listeners out here, by the way.  Fair weather fans.  They're here when it's sunny and nice.  Literally.  Going across here.  That would be, you know.  Break it up.  That would be crazy.  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  Driver guy.  Just beep to us.  Everyone is miserable out here on the sidewalk today.  Because it stinks.  It's cold and rainy in New York City.  The chick getting naked and stuff was really good.  Yeah.  Dug that.  That killed about an hour of the show today.  She had an awful bunt, big fat ass, and little tits. 
[02:12:00]  Is she really that bad?  I haven't gotten a good look at her yet.  Nah.  Not that bad.  Seen worse.  I get dizzy looking through those.  I paid for worse.  I get dizzy looking through those dumb binoculars.  My nephew wants to come in tomorrow.  He's 11.  To see that?  Yeah.  He wants to come in and watch the show for a little while.  Growing pervert.  Let him.  You're cultivating.  Yeah.  Let's show him his first naked girl.  CBS would appreciate that.  When is it going to get nice? 
[02:12:30]  He dropped something, Danny.  Stop littering.  He's littering to put wow stickers in the same place that they're removed every day.  I know.  Don't litter.  We here on the Opie and Anthony show do not support litterers.  Do I have to take a dump?  Do you?  Oh, you never have to take a dump.  I know.  I hope you shit your pants.  I did.  What's better than a friend shitting their pants?  Nothing, Jimmy.  What kind of logs do you think Anthony has? 
[02:13:00]  Right now, it's probably going to look like lava.  Like a fucking pile of I'm tired, soupy lava.  I'm thinking he has perfect logs.  No.  No.  No.  No?  What's cooking here ain't good.  For him to have to shit this bad on 57th Street.  Are you percolating?  I've been staying at the hotel over the weekend and then last night.  And I get the fruit plate.  Oh, boy.  And it's a huge plate of cantaloupe, strawberries, honeydew.  Oh, boy.  And it's all just made this soup that is ready to blast out of me like Mount St. Helens. 
[02:13:30]  I should have come with toilet paper.  It could take a piece of my cheek off and send it flying miles.  All right.  Let's see if the bum is here today.  Yeah, of course he is.  Get a job.  Let's just walk right by him and completely ignore him.  Yeah, this time.  Not a word.  Don't even acknowledge he's there.  He's sleeping again.  Oh, is he?  All right.  Well, let's make a little bit of a...  Just wake him up.  He needs a haircut. 
[02:14:00]  Whose money is this?  Hey, Mac.  How are you today?  Hey, Mac.  All right.  We'll see you soon.  Yeah, it's raining.  We've lost interest.  We have a doctor that's supposed to do the walk with us and see what's going on with his leg.  But I guess the doctor's waiting for nice weather.  Hey, look at this looker.  Hi, miss.  We're doing a story.  Jesus.  How are you holding up in the rain, AIDS?  Are you for real?  Yes.  Yes, we're doing a radio story.  It's about the rain, AIDS, and how people are holding up and stuff.  How are you holding up, AIDS?  Okay.  All right.  It was good. 
[02:14:30]  The subway was fine.  No flooding.  No, no flooding.  Nobody tried to grow up here, sodomized or anything.  Sorry?  No, but it was cool on the subway.  No flooding.  No problems.  Right.  Right.  Okay.  We're just doing a walkover.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  I think we have to interview this woman over here, Jimmy.  Which one?  The one that is on the phone fat.  Oh.  Hey, Mama Kasmus.  Oh, too bad you're on the phone.  We're doing a radio show.  We're trying to do some interviews.  Oh, okay. 
[02:15:00]  You want to do the interview?  What kind of interview?  For fat people.  We're just talking about the rain and how people stay out of the rain.  And stuff like that.  And what are the people doing?  I walk through the raindrops.  LOL.  Oh, good gosh.  Where are you from, dear?  From Staten Island.  What's your name?  Iris.  Hi, Iris.  What are you doing in the city?  I'm going to work.  Okay.  What kind of a job do you have?  Management.  Oh, right.  Wow.  She's very prepared for these answers.  Who are you talking to on the phone?  My best friend, Sandy. 
[02:15:30]  Why aren't you just at work?  What?  Why aren't you at work?  Because I don't have to be here until 930.  Okay.  Well, this is fun.  Well, stay dry.  You guys have a good day.  Yeah, we will.  I suck at these.  You should have asked her when the baby was due.  That was a good one.  Why didn't you ask me?  See, now that would have been funny.  I had to use my mic to find her.  That was very funny.  That would have been funny.  All I could think of was vicious things to say to her.  I know.  Horrible.  I'm such a coward in person.  Yeah.  So, what do you...  I'm not even going to start with them now. 
[02:16:00]  Like, I'm brave.  Kenny.  Where's Kenny?  No smoothie for me today.  Yeah.  It might do more damage.  So, miss, what do you do for a living besides freeze hands solo?  I want a picture.  I want a smoothie.  Yeah, we'll do a picture.  Yeah, we'll do a picture.  No, why not?  We're not going to be inconvenienced by it, sir.  Step in.  Have someone take it.  Let's go.  While we're young.  You want to get in it?  Oh, it's picture time.  Have the faggot Steve do it. 
[02:16:30]  All right.  Let's pretend we're broadcasting.  All right.  Bye, mister.  You're welcome.  Love the show, man.  Of course you do.  Everyone loves the show.  Get in line, shit dick.  Club Soda Kenny, smoothies for Jimmy and I, all right?  No, I don't want a smoothie.  Oh, no?  I got a big meeting after this.  I want a smoothie.  You can't be in the bathroom.  I got a big meeting with Sirius.  Smoothies?  No.  No.  Pretzels?  No.  No.  No smoothie.  Oh, I want pretzels.  All right. 
[02:17:00]  Is that a cup?  Yeah.  All right.  I guess we'll...  And a handjob.  Do you really have a meeting with Sirius?  That made me scared.  Yes.  Huh?  Never.  They want me to do my own show.  Really?  They want to be called Sist Talk with Jimmy.  We'll be upstairs in a few.  Over here, Anthony!  Where the fuck am I?  The fuck is this kid?  Disgusting.  Sexual.  Parents say it is not for kids.  Pornography in the workplace.  People played on TV screens for drawings.  They rants out and took off with a family car. 
[02:17:30]  People making nasty comments about women.  Virus spreading in our area.  Find out where.  Racial language and racist attacks.  Push the button!  I'm me and Anthony!  I'm a black ninja, fuckbait!  All right.  We remember.  Shut up.  We smoke pot with Snoop Doggy Dogg on a daily basis.  You're talking out your ass.  Just give me some action today.  I'm going to crap myself.  Oh, what a log you're going to have.  Holy shit.  Holy shit! 
[02:18:00]  Yahoo!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Holy shit.  Yahoo!  And the O.  With Opie.  I have psychosis.  Anthony.  I'm a xenophobic asshole.  Jim Norton.  I don't have the chops to do this.  And a bunch of zeros.  Good old Ben.  Ah!  Steve really is love.  Perfectly enunciating bulb.  Sorry, Steve.  E-Rock!  I bring nothing to the table.  They love when Hawk buffs up.  Shut up!  But more importantly, we see Derek's balls. 
[02:18:30]  You just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Problem, Hawk?  My cross is burning so bad.  Shut up!  Ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We don't get a break.  All right!  Right already.  Oh!  Another day without the Stanley Cup.  Where's my Stanley Cup? 
[02:19:00]  Doesn't XM have hockey?  Yeah.  Give me the goddamn Stanley Cup!  I really thought we were going to get the Stanley Cup that time.  Wait, does XM have hockey?  Yes!  Do something.  Do something nice for us for once.  No bitching.  Oh yeah, no bitching today.  Not today.  Takes us a little longer to set things up these days.  I love this Alabama Democrat. 
[02:19:30]  He disputes the Holocaust.  Wow.  And he's speaking to a pro-white organization.  A Democrat?  Yeah, he's from Alabama.  And he, uh...  What's he say?  This guy is a classic.  He thinks that the Holocaust is a myth.  And he says, uh...  Tyson says, aside from his views on race and the Holocaust, Darby also has publicly advocated  legalizing drugs and shooting all illegal immigrants.  How do you not vote for this goose?  Right to the point. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, the soundbite you'd get for the next few years.  And what is he, uh, running for?  Or, um...  He's in Birmingham, Alabama.  He's a candidate for Alabama Attorney General.  He's actually...  I think I vote for him.  He's too liberal.  That's really funny, actually.  He's a bleeding heart.  All right.  Where do we begin?  I don't know.  We're the 50...  We never did the top 10, uh, most depressing songs of all time.  I'll reply.  This is mine.  What the hell is going on out there? 
[02:20:30]  I don't know.  What happened, Thad?  Nothing.  What's the matter?  It should be closed.  Atta boy.  What?  Huh?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  Huh?  What?  What?  That's the worst watch ever.  Right?  Can we actually punch into Ben's interview with, uh, Ortiz right now?  What?  What? 
[02:21:00]  What?  Gotcha, the malanga.  Duggan, is he okay?  Uh...  You think Ben's doing a good job?  No.  You think he's shy and nervous?  Have we even talked about this on the air yet?  No.  Freaking Ben, uh, I don't know how he pulled this one off, but he left at 6.15 this morning,  a mere 15 minutes into the show, uh, after the show started, he's on a train to Washington  as we speak to go, um, interview David Ortiz.  Yeah. 
[02:21:30]  I wish we could do that.  I would love to interview David Ortiz.  Yeah, what would we say, though?  Thanks for nothing.  I know, you bastard.  Thank you.  What is Ben going to say?  Nothing.  Ben is just going to, like, fawn.  I blocked it.  I'm going to fawn over him.  There'll be a lot of boah-has and do...  Just nonsense.  I'd like to read a transcript.  Boah-ha-ha.  Boah-ha.  David, you know what?  David Ortiz is going to think that they sent, like, a retarded kid from that news organization  that got Al Franken. 
[02:22:00]  Okay.  I'm glad you're here.  All right.  Remember, Al Franken, all uncomfortable.  Please find attached a sound clip of an Aussie radio show telling a joke.  Okay.  This is from Steve.  Is it good, Steve?  Well, let's watch this wishy-washy non-answer.  Well, you know, a lot of people might have said something.  Sometimes.  Maybe funny if...  What is this about?  We're trying to think it's funny.  You clean up some of this material.  Someone sent this in.  I can't remember if you would ask for bad jokes or bad cheesy something. 
[02:22:30]  It was an Australian radio show, and someone called it a bad joke.  Is it funny?  Indeed.  No, it's a bad joke.  If you think it's funny, it's funny.  If you don't think it's funny, not funny.  Here's the problem.  A bad joke usually takes four seconds.  I see that this clip is three minutes long.  Oh, yeah.  It's a long-set-up bad joke, too.  Oh, God.  Oh, boy.  Is it the three-part joke where it's like the first guy does this, and the second guy  does this, and the third guy does this?  It's along those lines, I think.  Oh, I hate the three-part joke.  A couple attending an art exhibition at the National Gallery was staring at a portrait 
[02:23:00]  that had them...  I know this one.  Oh, you do?  Yes.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  I do.  Stop, Jimmy.  A couple is standing in an art gallery, and the one guy goes, did you paint that?  And she goes, fuck you, you kangaroo fucker.  Love that joke.  It's probably funnier than the real joke.  A couple is standing in an art gallery, and all of a sudden a fucking kangaroo comes  over, and an aborigines come over, and we call them niggas down here. 
[02:23:30]  Fucking...  Oh, they do.  That awful Australian accent is the unsexiest accent.  Chicks love Aussie accents.  Well, I don't like it on a girl.  Hey, you want to go out?  I can't even do it.  You want to go out for a shrimp?  You want to go out for a touch of the...  Shut up.  Are you even trying to...  Are you even trying to...  Not really.  That stinks, that accent.  Hey.  Let's get some...  Down under, hey.  Let's get some Aussie...  Hey.  Aussie girls to call us today.  Yeah, with your fucking awful accent. 
[02:24:00]  I'd rather hear a cleft palate and a lisp combined with French.  Ron in Canada.  Trying to figure out...  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, Ron.  You guys are awesome, Jimmy.  You're awesome.  You're certainly correct.  Well, I know.  But I was just hearing that Ben snore there, and I want that for my ringtone,  for my mother-in-law, when she phones.  It sounds to me like what a stegosaurus stuck in a tar pit would sound like. 
[02:24:30]  Like just trying to get out.  Poor stegosaurus.  Huh?  You put that elastic on a donkey's balls, and it just...  No, I don't.  Perhaps our own Steve does.  That's what it sounds like.  Like when a bull rapes a small female boar.  Motherfucker.  I cannot believe that's him actually snoring. 
[02:25:00]  I know.  That is Ben's five times.  Snoring.  All right.  You guys are awesome, man.  All right.  Thank you.  We all love you up here.  Oh, thank you.  Why don't we throw that on opianathlete.com so they can make it into a ringtone?  And why can't I have that as a ringtone on my dumb pebble?  Uh-oh.  Why is it a dumb pebble now?  Pebble stinks.  That was the best phone ever when you first bought it.  Because I can't get ringtones.  You can't get ringtones.  Well, we were trying to get...  No, you couldn't get twidgels because your phone wasn't compatible with the one with the  service you used.  But...  Who's showering?  Who's that?  Red rum is showering on Palton. 
[02:25:30]  I love red rum.  Well, what the...  Why am I...  But can I get...  Now she's covering up.  Ah, you can't do that.  You just can't do that.  I love red rum.  She's a dirty girl.  Hey, Steve.  Yeah.  Can you get Ben's snore as my ringtone?  I'll do a little bit of homework.  I'll see if I can get it on there.  Shouldn't be too hard.  You know what would also be an awesome ringtone?  Yeah.  Is Jimmy's mic test.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  That would be.  Here's a good one.  With a mouth full of pretzel. 
[02:26:00]  I have pretzel.  Sometimes I lick my pretzel and smell it.  I heard that somewhere.  Perhaps it was yesterday.  I didn't say on the air, though.  No?  No.  I thought you did.  It was off air.  Who knows what's on air or on air or FM or XM anymore.  All right.  Drive me crazy.  Hold on.  Let me give them a ringtone.  All right.  Here's a ringtone.  Yeah.  Hey.  One more thing.  I hope you...  Oh, my God.  You stupid fuck.  You ruined it.  You ruined it.  He was doing the ringtone, and you fucking chime in.  Jimmy, now don't do it. 
[02:26:30]  Okay.  Someone teach this kid some fucking manners.  Ron, thank you.  Here's a ringtone.  Ringy, dingy, dingy.  Ringy, dingy, dingy.  So obnoxious.  I love it.  He's just a kid a little fucking manners.  I'm trying to do a ringtone.  He's getting fucking fresh.  I'm breaking your balls, and you don't matter what you're getting fucking fresh.  Ring, dingy, ding.  Ring, dingy, ding.  All right.  There's your ringtone, jizz toes.  Let's get back to the Aussie radio show.  I'm telling a joke. 
[02:27:00]  I want to hear the joke.  Funny joke from Australia.  A couple attending an art exhibition at the National Gallery were staring at a portrait  that had them totally confused.  The painting depicted three black men totally naked sitting on a park bench.  Two of the black men, Paco, had black penises.  But the one seated in the middle had a pink penis.  A pink?  Pink penis.  Pink.  The curator of the gallery realised the confused couple were having trouble interpreting the  painting and offered his assessment.  He went on and on for nearly half an hour, explaining, Pete, how it depicted the sexual 
[02:27:30]  emasculation of African Americans in a predominantly white patriarchal society.  Ah, right.  In fact, he pointed out, some serious critics believe that the pink penis reflects the  cultural and social oppression expressed by gay men in a contemporary society.  After the curator left, a Scotsman approached the couple and said,  Would you like to know what that painting's really about? 
[02:28:00]  The couple said, How would you claim to know more about that painting than the curator of  the gallery?  Because I'm the guy who painted it, he replied.  In fact, there's no African American representation at all.  They're just three Scottish coal miners and the guy in the middle went home for lunch.  What's that?  Oh, yes.  Do you get it?  I like that joke. 
[02:28:30]  I don't think I was paying enough attention.  I absolutely like that one.  Shit, I wasn't paying attention.  I thought there was two black penises and a pink penis in the middle.  There was three guys on the bench and there was a pink penis and two black penises.  No, no, but the couple was watching them.  Right.  Yeah.  So, I didn't listen.  The guy was hungry, so he left throwing.  He ate.  But he came back because they're all from Scotland.  Shut up, Jimmy.  You didn't get it, did you?  Here's a practice.  Wait.  Here's a ringtone. 
[02:29:00]  Was that horrible?  Yeah, why don't they have ringtones like that?  That is your ringtone.  You should start a whole ringtone business, Jimmy.  Imagine you're just on the train and you hear that coming from someone's pocket.  Listen, we got more.  We got more.  I guess not.  That was it.  Wow.  All right.  There was just more time left on it, but it wasn't really time.  Okay.  All right.  Can I have the song for the dumps?  Live from the Opie and Anthony Show Studios, that's the Daily Dump Report. 
[02:29:30]  Daily Dump Report for this day, May 16th, 2006, 6.17 a.m.  I quote, or fucking eat out of a garbage can.  That was Jim Norton talking about immigrants.  And the funny thing is, I've been pretty good with the language, but it just got away from me.  It really did, because you said it so naturally.  It wasn't like a joke that you were cursing and trying to shock people.  You were just talking, and your own potty mouth came out. 
[02:30:00]  Here's a ringtone.  Hold on.  Okay.  Oh, that one was boring.  No, it wasn't.  That's for when you're in the library.  Library.  On Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Are you in the library?  Oh, look.  Ringtone.  It's all ringtones.  Oh.  Oh.  A little Diet Coke.  At 6.42 a.m.  Asshole.  Someone said asshole.  It was a caller talking about being attacked. 
[02:30:30]  Of course, the person was an asshole.  7.06.  We all knew this was going to be dumped out of.  When a caller talking about seeing a naked woman on the road said,  drives with one titty out.  Even though you had the cute little T.Y. at the end of tit.  Unacceptable.  7.53 a.m.  I don't know why this is another one of those gray area marginal calls.  This was right on the fence.  Right on the fence.  I smell cunt.  During song parody about Silence of the Lambs down in the hole. 
[02:31:00]  It's all context.  Yeah.  All context.  At 8.26 a.m.  Eat whatever the fuck.  Eat whatever they fucking want to.  Caller about gators eating people.  There's your daily dump sheet.  There are people out there that go to Scott, Steve, putting a ringtone on.  Guys like Colin Quinn have no idea how to use their cell phone,  so Bob Kelly will always put weird things on his phone that Colin can't take off.  So if any of you out there have friends or a girlfriend or a wife 
[02:31:30]  that does not know how to take things off her phone,  I'm going to get a little ringtone that you might want to put on there  and she won't know how to take it off.  Okay.  Ring, ding, ding, pick up the phone, cunt.  Ring, ding, ding, pick up the phone, cunt.  Ring, ding, dash, cunt.  Now just put that on your wife, girlfriend, daughter.  Put that on anybody's phone that doesn't know how to take it off. 
[02:32:00]  Even a guy friend and does not know how to take it off  because some people don't know how to use their phones.  They know how to just answer it.  Or how about it?  Ah, fuck, it wasn't loud enough.  Ah, it smelled like Chinese food from last night.  I would absolutely please somebody put that on someone else's phone.  All right, here's Dave in Oceanside.  Dave, what do you say, Dave?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, how about, can we get a blorker, blorker, blorker from Jimmy for my ringtone?  Jimmy's got the best ringtones. 
[02:32:30]  I'm feeling precious.  Hold on.  He'll do it in a little bit.  I'll do it in a minute.  All right, let's go to Japan.  Japan.  Japan.  Japan.  Japan.  Japan.  Japan.  Opie, you're in Japan.  You're in Japan.  So am I.  So am I.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  How did this happen?  Jim Norton has a big cock.  Cock.  No, he doesn't.  No, he doesn't.  Hello.  Hello.  We're broadcasting from Ben's cup.  A blurka, blurka, blurka.  A blurka, blurka, blurka.  A blurka, blurka, blurka. 
[02:33:00]  A blurka, blurka, blurka.  A blurka, blurka, blurka.  A blurka.  Here you go.  Hello.  Hello.  Bobby.  Bobby.  Cindy.  Cindy.  Bobby.  Bobby.  I knew we shouldn't have come to the Grand Canyon.  T-cells.  T-cells.  Dignity!  Dignity!  Any weight over 85 pounds?  Listen to me laugh at you.  I like listening to us. 
[02:33:30]  We do a good radio show.  All the way to Japan.  Brett, are you there?  And then back.  Brett!  That's how long it takes to get to Japan and back.  You know, electricity moves quickly.  I'll say it does.  Radio waves.  Like the speed of light.  It's gotta go 70 miles an hour.  Perhaps faster than that, Jim.  You're a little faster.  Bye, Brett.  Bye, Brett.  I think we should just listen to ourselves.  In Japan. 
[02:34:00]  You know, that's twice as good a show.  Cause it's the same thing.  Twice.  If you miss a joke, you catch it a quarter of a second later.  Right.  Alright.  One other thing here.  Steve stuff.  Okay, here's the back story.  I'm going to stop at a radio station on Long Island.  I shall have them remain nameless.  Anyway, these freaking douchebags paid to do a half an hour show.  And they were complete assholes.  They thought they were big radio stars.  But they paid to do radio. 
[02:34:30]  So they left and went to WLIR, thankfully.  So I decided to do a Ramone call.  Here you go.  Oh, I thought we were going to get the recording of their program.  New York fan 16.  L.I.R.  Real radio show.  Come on in.  Ramone.  She did a cunt.  Smells like gefilta fish.  Goodbye.  What was that?  Gefilta fish.  Oh, I got a hole.  Okay, have a good one. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah, okay.  Have a nice day.  They have a hole.  A cunt smells like gefilta fish.  Gefilta fish.  All right, that's pretty good.  I'll give it to them.  They don't have a delay over there, huh?  I guess not.  Let's say hi to Rich in Philly.  Rich.  What's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  Yeah, I want to hear Jimmy's impression of Richard Johnson as a ringtone.  Hmm. 
[02:35:30]  Hold on.  Hold on.  This is a ringtone.  He was swallowing pretzel.  I'm sorry, guys.  I'm a faggot.  I'm a faggot.  I'm a faggot.  That'd be fun to put on a friend's.  Absolutely.  And have him not know how to remove it.  All right, here we go.  I'm a faggot.  From the book, I hate myself and want to die.  I need the cock.  I need the cock.  These are all to be put on Foundry Music as ringtones. 
[02:36:00]  I hope they know that.  Or how about this?  Jews are inferior.  Jews are inferior.  Jews are inferior.  Oh, my God.  Why not?  Put that on someone's phone who works at the law office.  Yes.  All right, we're going to need some help with this.  Fumbling with his phone.  Panicking.  From the book, I hate myself and want to die.  The most depressing songs you ever heard. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  We forgot to do the top ten list, so we do that now.  Okay?  And if you could help us with what some of these songs are about, that would be wonderful.  Oh, Brett's back.  Brett.  Hey, Opie.  What's up, Brett?  How's it going, bud?  You're calling from Japan?  Yeah, I'm in Japan.  Shin Yokohama.  Uh.  What are you doing there?  I'm spreading the virus.  I got my new brown O and A.  Literally.  SARS.  Hot off the press last week.  Yeah.  And so this morning I ran around the street like a complete idiot and walked up to people 
[02:37:00]  and said, hey, you guys know who Opie and Anthony are.  So first they look at you funny because you're actually speaking English to them.  They don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  And then you ask them about Jim Norton.  You ask them about all this different stuff.  And they just basically run away from him.  So I got a couple pictures of them.  I'll send them into the website tomorrow.  Of Japanese people running from you.  Yeah.  Because, you know, the first thing is you're about a foot taller than they are.  Yeah.  And they just simply do not understand what happens when you're going to speak English  to them.  And so I'm a marketing guy.  So my theory is you got to walk around, you got to ask people what they think. 
[02:37:30]  So I spent the week last week in Seattle doing this.  And I listened to a couple local shows there.  They got the Man Show, the Man Room.  They got the H-Hole Army.  They got all this crap, the copycats stuff.  It doesn't matter how far away someone is.  When a call sucks, it just sucks.  Oh, come on, Anthony.  I'm trying to become the unofficial marketing guy for the LNA program.  Could be a guy calling from a couple of doors down.  I like Brett.  Brett's all right.  Or just from halfway around the world.  He's a marketing guy.  What do you sell, melatonin?  No, software. 
[02:38:00]  So how long are you in Japan?  It's 11 o'clock to the night here, Rich.  So it's about 10.30.  Shower curtain rings.  Oh, come on, Anthony.  Cut me a break, man.  It's late.  It's been a long night drinking.  I'm not that late.  What time is it?  500 o'clock?  Stupid Japanese time.  Well, we've got to spread the virus in all the different countries.  You can't just settle for Boston and New York and all the crap places you guys want to be.  Well, yeah, Japan could be a big market for us. 
[02:38:30]  Absolutely, man.  Go to some African village and tell them you're spreading the virus.  Because I want to be hacked up with a machete.  Actually, tomorrow I'm heading to Korea.  We're going to try to give it a shot in Seoul and see what these guys think.  Yeah.  I'm thinking if the Japanese don't get it, the Koreans probably won't as well.  Well, good luck to you.  Keep up your good nature.  Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Anthony.  Keep in touch.  All right.  I'm calling you next week from Boston.  Please do.  Yeah, later.  All right.  There goes Brett from Japan.  I hope that cost them a lot of money.  Jesus.  All right. 
[02:39:00]  The most depressing songs of all time, according to this book, I Hate Myself and Want to Die.  They did the top 52, but we'll cut it down to 50.  We'll do...  Well, number 11 was won by Metallica, so it just missed the top 10 list.  Aw.  And number 10.  Number 10.  You got the list in there, Dirk?  He better.  He got to play the songs.  If he doesn't have that list, he would have a list of job openings.  Number 10 is not a depressing song.  No?  Fun little ditty.  Then why is it on the list?  I don't know.  It's by the Jim Carroll band. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, because it's People Who Die.  People Who Die.  It's a depressing song.  There's a clue.  He was 12 years old.  He fell from the roof on.  He's 2-9.  Kathy was 11 when she pulled the plug.  26 friends in a bottle of wine.  Bobby had leukemia.  14 years old.  He looked like 55 when he died.  He was a friend of mine.  People Who Die.  Die.  It's an up-tempo number, but for God's sake, it's pretty depressing.  Little kids. 
[02:40:00]  One more verse.  He broke his church and let the gimmicks go rotten.  So they died of hepatitis in upper Manhattan.  Flying to Vietnam.  Pulling it in the head.  Bobby OD'd on Drano on the night that he was wet.  There were two more friends of mine.  Two more friends that died.  Those are people who died.  Die.  Those are people who died.  Die.  Those are people who died.  There you go.  Number 10, People Who Died by the Jim Carroll band.  Robert Reed was a dad on TV. 
[02:40:30]  Ended up getting the HIV.  When they heard it, they went tee hee.  And I have it too, said their pal Jimmy.  Huh?  A lot of the songs in the top 10 I don't think I've ever heard in my life.  No?  Mary Ann Faithfull in 9th place.  A song called Sister Morphine.  Does anyone?  I think I've heard it.  Shut up, Jimmy.  I know Mary Ann Faithfull.  I think I've heard that one, though.  No, you don't.  I do.  No, you don't. 
[02:41:00]  Sister Morphine.  Brother Aspirin.  I don't think Brother Aspirin makes an appearance in this song.  Uncle Cottonball.  Ant Needle.  Let's go to Jason in Oklahoma City.  Jason.  Hey, I was wondering if I could get a ringtone from Jimmy there.  All right.  All right.  Which one?  Get a wah-wah penis.  Oh, yeah.  You got to do wah-wah penis.  A lot of people like wah-wah penis.  Wah-wah penis.  Wah-wah.  Wait, yeah. 
[02:41:30]  Let me do it.  Thanks, Hawk.  Wah-wah penis.  Wah-wah penis.  Good ringtone, man.  Exactly.  Good ringtone.  Nick in Texas.  Nick?  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Listen, whoever made this stupid list, a song has to sound depressing to be depressing.  That's what I'm saying.  Nobody can just...  Go ahead.  That was ridiculous.  Yeah, that's up-tempo.  I like that one.  Yeah, that was too...  Even if the words say, die, die, die, or commit suicide, commit suicide, if it sounds 
[02:42:00]  happy, it's happy.  It's kind of like you playing the Benny Hill music behind something, you know?  I completely agree with you.  Still depressing, the words.  Not at all.  Come on, little kids with leukemia and...  Ah, you just get into it.  It's a...  65 when he dies.  Just sing along to it.  Yeah.  That's a toe-tapper.  Uh, Sister Morphine, what's this about?  We have a little taste?  No?  No?  All right, good.  Sister Morphine, oh, the time has come...  No?  Uh, number eight. 
[02:42:30]  Sister Morphine, brother John!  No, I don't think that's it either.  I hate that fucking song.  Wait, it's, uh, it's, uh...  Someone's knocking at the door.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Somebody's ringing the bell.  Do me a favor, open the door, and let him in.  And let him in.  That's the name of the song, let him in.  So, hopefully it's not a shoe salesman.  All right, number eight, uh, it's Nine Inch Nails and Hurt. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Cash's is better.  Cash's is way better.  I know the original...  More depressing.  I know the original is done by Nine Inch Nails, but can we get a taste of Johnny Cash doing Hurt?  This song is deeply depressing.  I hurt myself today.  Here he goes.  Hello.  I'm Johnny Cash.  I should have had Joaquin Phoenix sing this.  I hurt myself today!  I hurt myself today. 
[02:43:30]  Did ya?  To see if I still feel.  Well, do ya?  I focus on the pain.  Did ya?  The only thing that's real.  Is it?  The needle tears a hole.  Does it?  The old familiar sting.  Is it?  Try to kill it all away. 
[02:44:00]  Do ya?  But I remember everything.  Do ya?  What have I become?  My sweetest friend.  Everyone I know goes away in the air.  Do they? 
[02:44:30]  All right, we get it.  Yeah, could I?  That's a great song though, man.  Fantastic.  Hey, let's say hi to Rick.  Another Canadian checking in.  Lucky us today.  Hey, Rick, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey.  I'm telling you, we fucking love you guys up here.  Thank you.  We haven't gotten a lot of emails from Canada yet, Rick.  What's up with that?  Go.  We don't have computers up here. 
[02:45:00]  It's cold.  It's cold.  They freeze up the keys, eh?  Anyways, you guys don't know who Jim Carroll is?  You gotta know who Jim Carroll is.  Of course we know who Jim Carroll is.  Of course we know who Jim Carroll is.  Okay, good.  Basketball Diaries, my friend.  You've never heard the song before?  I've heard the song many times.  Oh, coronavirus.  I think we all heard the song.  Isn't it supposed to be autobiographical for him?  Like, didn't he write the Basketball Diaries, that movie with that Hagate DiCaprio?  I don't know.  What?  Hagate.  Wow. 
[02:45:30]  Uh-oh.  Phew.  Uh, System Morphine is a Stones song that was co-written by Marianne Faithfull.  The Stones version is on Sticky Fingers.  Eric, do we have that?  Is that true?  Yeah, we got it now.  Alright, thank you, Rick.  We know-  It's a historic day, by the way.  Why?  Because it's the first IM I ever got from PalTalk that actually contributed something  to the show.  What?  You know I don't like being IM, so I will ban you anyway.  No, I would say pardon this one, if they help the show.  Oh, okay. 
[02:46:00]  I'd pardon you.  And the rest of the room.  Yeah.  But somebody's gotta pay.  You're right.  I say-  Someone's gotta pay just to keep the law in line.  Uh.  Put one of the hot chicks out.  You gotta show them- I would let them back in, but you gotta show them who's boss.  Yeah?  Do I have to do that?  No.  Yes.  Alright.  Yeah, let's hear the- let's hear- oh, I see what you're saying.  Which one?  You wanna hear the Rolling Stones version?  Does Mary Ann Faithful sing on the song?  I don't know. 
[02:46:30]  Yes.  I don't know if I know this.  Red Rum's gotta go.  No!  Are you kidding?  You said-  I-  But not Red Rum.  Why?  Because I like her name, and she shows her bosoms.  It's a Shining reference.  No!  O-Town.  Alright, I pardon everybody.  Shut up.  O-Town.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's up, Robert?  Hey, uh, thanks for, uh, making that Johnny Cash song a little better, Jimmy.  That's so fucking depressing.  I love that song, man.  It's very depressing.  Maybe you'll cheer me up.  Do ya? 
[02:47:00]  May 26th, 27th, 28th at the Strap.  Green, New Jersey.  Atta boy.  7-3-2-5-4-5.  Ah!  Ah!  Alright.  Fucking shit-dick Vinny with the funny phone number to smash your cock.  I was gonna say smash your teeth with my cock, but then I said smash your cock, and I almost  said with my teeth.  Smash your cock with my teeth.  I'll show him.  Wait a minute.  Here, give me a cock against my face.  Yeah.  Who's boss?  Blake, you are.  Let's listen to Marianne Faithful backing up to ninth place, Sister Morphine.  Oh.  What happened?  Oh, Iraq.  Oh, Iraq.  You telling the boss he's wrong, Iraq? 
[02:47:30]  Alright, hit it.  You're wrong.  I hurt myself.  I hurt myself.  Angel.  She was great at Metallica's song.  Yeah.  Da da da da da da da da da da da da.  Oh, Iraq.  Oh, Iraq.  Oh, Iraq.  In my hospital bed.  Oh.  Tell me, Sister Morphine, when I'm coming round again. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, I don't think I'm quite that long, no.  Here, turn that.  Can I have Mick Jagger show her how it's done?  God, she has the worst voice ever.  I like her.  You didn't like her in the Metallica song?  No.  What was the one she was...  What was that fucking song?  Hated it. 
[02:48:30]  Where she chimed in and ruined the song.  I was at...  When Brewer was on SNL and I got to watch Metallica rehearse Fuel and that song.  It was like 15 of us in a room on the SNL soundstage and Metallica came in and was rehearsing.  They had to time it out, so they were doing the same song like eight times just to get  the timing right.  And then Marianne Faithful came in and was helping them, you know, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Whatever song it was, Fuel was one and the other one.  The memory remains.  The memory remains.  Hated it.  She ruined it.  Hated it. 
[02:49:00]  Hadfield was annoyed at her.  He didn't want her to stand in the next door.  Boris, get away.  Mick used to bang her, by the way.  Mick used to bang her, by the way.  I'm Vicki Rivers, I mean.  Not much better.  Is it?  I said not much better.  No.  Oh, okay.  I don't like either version.  Not quite sympathy for the devil, is it?  No.  Not much better.  Not much better.  In my heart.  In my heart.  Is it?  I said not much better.  No.  Oh, okay.  Tell me, Sister Morphine, when are you coming round again? 
[02:49:30]  Alright, enough.  I like her version better, actually.  I don't like either version.  Not quite sympathy for the devil, is it?  No.  Sister Morphine.  Here's your ringtone.  That's called pretzel bag.  Onoxious ringtone.  That is such a great business right there. 
[02:50:00]  It will be downloaded like crazy.  Wait, wait, one more on the pretzel.  Uh-oh, look.  Mother's calling.  Oh, God.  Number seven.  Most depressing songs of all time, according to this dumb book, I Hate Myself and Wanna Die.  I love you.  Billie Holiday.  Billie Holiday.  Strange Fruit.  Who's he?  I understand.  Strange Fruit.  Oh, boy.  Someone help us out with what these songs are about, by the way. 
[02:50:30]  Help us on the instant feedback or something.  I think we know what this song's about.  Never heard the, uh, saying strange fruit.  Something that grows on trees.  It's not supposed to be there.  It's strange.  Maybe that fruit was seen with a white woman.  Ah.  Ah, oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah.  Long enough intro, huh? 
[02:51:00]  Don't stop treating me like a whore.  Yeah?  You like Huey Lewis on the news?  How long does this intro go on?  Wow.  Come on.  Get to the strange fruit part.  Is this an instrumental? 
[02:51:30]  Do we even know?  Oh, is it?  I don't know.  There.  There she goes.  There she goes.  Bear a strange fruit.  She's a fag.  It's a girl.  No, the fruit, you idiot.  That she's looking at.  Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze.  Jesus.  There's a strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees. 
[02:52:00]  That's just a little depressing.  It's good, though.  Who wrote this?  Oh, it hurt.  Pastoral scene of the gallant sound.  The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth.  The scent of magnolia. 
[02:52:30]  Sweet and fresh.  Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.  Was this a hit?  There is a fruit for the crows to pluck.  For the rain together.  For the wind to suck. 
[02:53:00]  For the sun to rise.  For the trees to drop.  Here is a strange and bitter crop.  Wow. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah.  Now they all get back at us with that strange fruit in their pants.  The giant plantain.  That's a good tune, though, man.  That is, uh...  I'm gonna have to go to iTunes and get that.  Put that on your iPod.  Yeah, why not?  I listen to that.  I listen to Minnie Ripperton singing, uh...  Loving You.  Yeah, but the fucking bird sharps wrecked that song.  It's the worst sound of...  What did you do that with a Casio?  Fucking 75.  Loving you.  Charp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp. 
[02:54:00]  Charp, chirp.  Flutter, flutter, chirp, chirp.  Another ringtone.  Of course.  Here's Captain Obvious.  Eric, what's up?  Hey, that's, uh...  It's about a winching, isn't it?  Really?  Wow.  It's not, actually.  It's about...  They planted seeds for one fruit and another fruit grew and it's just depressing in the  South.  It's very strange.  Okay.  Did he really think he was enlightening us on that one?  Yes.  He did.  Let's go to Jim in Florida.  Jim?  Because black bodies swinging from the trees wasn't exactly a tip off as to what it was 
[02:54:30]  about.  Hey guys, we need a collage of Steve's ringtones.  You know, a grrr in the hybrid car, all that.  Yeah, put those on foundry.  All right, yeah, we'll get a bunch of ringtones up on opiananthony.com.  That'd be great, dude.  Love you guys.  Thank you.  All right, so that song, yeah, that's definitely depressing.  More depressing than the Jim Carroll band, People Who Died.  Number six, most depressing songs of all time, Blood Rock.  I've never even heard of this band.  That's E-Rock when he's on his period. 
[02:55:00]  We all are getting going.  Wow, yeah.  The wheels just started turning and Jimmy's already in first gear.  Jimmy is quick.  He's ripping down the strip.  Blood Rock.  Oh, why'd you make a face before?  Because his breath is awful.  Oh, no.  I was trying to be cool, but...  Oh, stop, no.  I almost passed out.  Well, he leaned over because he was looking for something.  I was like, you've got to be kidding me.  Don't tell him when he gets back, though. 
[02:55:30]  All right.  Trying to be cool.  Keep it under your hat.  Johnny from...  No, Snap Man from Whack Bag.  People Who Died is about people lucky enough not to hear Brett's call.  Love in you.  All right, here we go.  So, Blood Rock.  Chirp, chirp.  Sixth place, a song called D-O-A.  Oh, sounds creepy.  Laying here, looking at the ceiling. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, I've heard of this song.  Yeah?  This is like a...  This is one of those songs the rock stations like to play every Halloween.  Oh, really?  Dead body?  Like Monster Mash?  Dead body.  It's Monster Mash in here.  I played this song many times when I was doing the rock jock thing. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Monster Mash stinks.  Oh, what an awful song.  It was a graveyard!  The Monster Mash!  All right.  All right.  It was all in a flash.  Was it?  Really?  His uncle fucked him in the ass.  The Monster Mash!  The Monster Rain!  Oh, the bubbling of the laboratory.  And my uncle took me down for some Monster Rain.  Monster Rain! 
[02:57:00]  Oh.  His butt was in pain.  Oh.  In the land.  Oh.  Were ya?  When my eyes beheld an eerie sight.  Did they?  A monster from the slab began to die.  Did he?  And suddenly, to my surprise.  He did the mash!  Did he?  He did the Monster Mash!  The Monster Mash!  It was a graveyard smash!  He did the mash!  Oh.  Huge hit.  He got on in a flash.  He did the mash!  I don't know who I want dead more.  Him?  Or the background people? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  Wow!  He's released.  Wow!  Somebody actually...  These women actually for years are probably telling people,  you ever hear Monster Mash?  Yeah.  I'm a backup singer.  I'm backup singer four.  They have the mash!  That's me!  You can hear me more than the other ones.  I like this version of Monster Mash.  Yes.  Okay.  Here I am, out for its throw, minding my own vampire business.  Hey, what's that noise under the porch?  I better investigate.  Oh my goodness, stop that. 
[02:58:00]  I'm scarred for life.  I don't remember this.  I was walking one fine day when I first saw two young eager boys hidden under the porch.  One was little Jimmy Norton with eyes so round.  He was on his friend's clutch making slurping sounds.  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  The monster rain.  And now his clothes are all stained. 
[02:58:30]  He did the rain.  It caused him mental pain.  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  With his little buggy eyes and soft little breasts.  He was blessed.  Young Jimmy saw that he was making amends.  His hair was all sticky, but he kept his pace.  Now we know why he likes hookers to piss on his face.  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  The monster rain.  The little Jimmy was game.  He did the rain.  It caused him mental pain. 
[02:59:00]  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  The two boys were just having fun.  The monster rain had just begun.  The other boy's father caught them and he said,  Hey there, what are you doing to my son?  Hey young Jimmy, let me tassle your hair.  Why you're so sticky and covered in sweat.  Your spit-stayed cheeks are so very pale.  When I just invented a game called the first night in jail, 
[02:59:30]  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  The monster rain.  The little Jimmy was game.  He did the rain.  And now his clothes are all stained.  He did the rain.  He did the monster rain.  Now that Jimmy's a little older, he must repent  that he has such memories of lava cement.  He should have protested and stated quite plain.  Dude, I'm not gonna taste your DNA. 
[03:00:00]  Oh no, you hear that?  They read it again.  Man, that's disturbing.  I'm going to have to have my eyes washed.  Why would anybody even tell this story?  Little Jimmy Norton's a sociopath.  Very funny.  Hey, a couple of instant feedbacks coming in.  Rob from DC, please isolate Jimmy singing along with Hurt.  Funniest shit ever.  Yeah, we should make a little promo or something out of that.  Oh, you got it? All right.  And then you got this asshole Surge Master from Whackbag.  Of course.  Are you fucking kidding me? 
[03:00:30]  Your show sucks and isn't funny because you assholes are sleepy.  Today, it's the worst.  The worst?  We've had much worse shows.  We've had horrific shows, sir.  I think today has been a very enjoyable show.  Maybe we'll rebroadcast them and remind you.  That's right, Surge Master.  All right, Surge Master.  You douchebag.  So getting back to the most depressing songs of all time.  You know what's a good song by Johnny Cash, by the way?  Life Goes On.  No.  Now go home and get your fucking shine box. 
[03:01:00]  I'm trying to point out a song right away.  You're getting fucking fresh.  He's just getting a little fucking manners.  All right, here's number six.  So it's Blood Rock.  They play it every Halloween on a lot of rock stations.  It's DOA and it's a guy.  He's dead, but he's singing.  Oh, is that it?  From his perspective, yes.  How does that happen?  It doesn't.  I think it's a really long song too, right?  In a rock block.  Yeah.  It's long. 
[03:01:30]  It's not that long.  We won't make it that far.  Sounds like it's long.  Yeah.  Laying here, looking at the ceiling.  Someone lays a sheet across my chest.  Oh, he's in a hotel.  No.  Something warm is flowing down my fingers.  He's singing Dominatrix.  Pain is flowing all through my back. 
[03:02:00]  I tried to move my arm and there's no feeling.  And when I look, I see there's nothing there.  What?  The face beside me stopped it totally bleeding. 
[03:02:30]  The girl I knew had such a distant stare.  I remember we were flying along and there's something in the air.  I remember we were flying along and there's something in the air. 
[03:03:00]  Oh, my trash is so creepy.  Then I look straight at the attendant.  His face is pale as it can be.  He bends and whispers something softly. 
[03:03:30]  He says, there's no chance for me.  I remember.  How is this more depressing than strange fruit?  This asshole in a Cessna, it's a John Denver story.  I was eating great nuts.  I hit the water. 
[03:04:00]  We know.  We know.  We're sure you did.  I was in first class having a Sunday.  The rest of the filthy O&A crew was in the back where they belong.  Let's get Eric in Kansas City.  Eric.  Oh, so why would someone have been calling me?  Hey.  Hey.  The most depressing song I've ever heard is Estrella by Brave Saint Saturn.  Hi.  What's it about?  It's about a kid who- 
[03:04:30]  Oh, can I call you back?  I'm on the radio.  Who is it, Jimmy?  It's Laura Armstrong.  Who is she?  I'll call you back in a few.  Who is she?  I have a meeting with her after.  Funny.  Okay.  Full of gelatin and you can pull her arms real far.  Oh, shit.  Hello?  Yeah.  Oh, you're on the phone too, right?  Guard ahead, sweet angel.  Sorry.  You got to play a song called Estrella by a band called Brave Saint Saturn.  We'll get right to it.  Who's deaf and going blunt?  I am.  Okay.  What's the song called?  My driving test? 
[03:05:00]  Sounds good.  Fuck em.  All right.  Back to the real list.  Yeah, we're going to take a break and we'll do the top five.  Okay.  What's the song called?  My driving test?  Sounds good.  Fuck em.  All right.  Yeah, we're going to take a break and we'll do the top five most depressing songs of all  time.  Although, who was the guy in the Wackbag that didn't like us?  Surge.  Everybody.  Surge.  Surge.  Douchebag.  Sorry, cuntface.  You're not enjoying the show.  Turn it off.  Why don't you just stop listening?  That's all you have to do.  Just fucking stop listening. 
[03:05:30]  Masterpiece Theater presents a production of Gargantuan Proportions, Ode to Ben's Hog,  as read by Rod Von Cocksmith.  Ben's Hog is so big, there's still snow on it in summertime.  Ben's Hog is so big, it won't return Spielberg's calls.  Ben's Hog has an elevator and a lobby.  Ben's Hog is so big, there was once a movie called Godzilla vs. Ben's Hog. 
[03:06:00]  Ben's Hog is so big, the head of it has only seen his balls in pictures.  Join us again as we pay tribute to the precious gift, which is Ben's Hog.  Spread the virus, motherfucker.  Let's go!  Let's go! 
[03:06:30]  Da-da-da-da-da!  Da-da-da-da-da!  Da-da-da-da-da!  Da-da-da-da-da!  Who's this?  It's raining blood?  Ow!  Slayer, right?  Sounds like him.  Yeah.  Manny in Jersey.  Manny, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Love the show.  You know, it's raining.  And it's already pretty depressing.  The top five, please don't do it, because I'm very close to pulling over and just fucking  hanging myself.  We're a national talk show.  It's not raining everywhere. 
[03:07:00]  That's right.  It's sunny somewhere.  Is it?  Well, it's sucking balls right now.  Fucking going to work and this shit.  I'll tell you.  It's New York area.  Love your show.  All right.  Thank you, Manny.  It's been awful lately.  And it just, it won't stop.  It's like, you watch seven.  Oh, God.  And the whole movie, it's just pouring rain and gray and miserable.  That's what New York has been for I don't even know how long.  It's close to a week now.  Where's the sun been?  It's close to a week. 
[03:07:30]  Where's the warm, kind of warm May weather?  Where's the daffodils?  I want daffodils.  Daffodils.  Daffodils.  Daffodils.  Daffodils.  I went to grab a daffodil.  Do we have Life Goes On by Johnny Cash?  Not do we hear it now, but I'm just in the future.  No, we...  Opie, I wouldn't know.  Derek, we don't have it right.  Hey, top five.  What, Opie?  Most depressing songs of all time. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  We finally hit good old Terry Jacks.  Terry Jacks?  The one hit wonder of seasons in the sun.  Oh, we had joy.  We had fun.  We had seasons in the sun.  What's sad about that?  You had some fucking fun at the beach.  A little fun.  What's wrong with it?  Where does it go wrong?  I don't know.  Oh, is it?  Yeah, maybe it starts bad. 
[03:08:30]  Goodbye to you, my trusted friend.  We've known each other since we were nine or ten.  Oh, right.  I want you to hit him over the head with that old Leslie keyboard.  Learned of love and ABC.  We can't climb trees.  Goodbye, my friend.  It's hard to die.  All the birds are all singing.  With the sun on.  You got no idea. 
[03:09:00]  Peek rows of everywhere.  Think of me and our banner.  We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons and our time.  But the hills that we climb  We're just seasons out of time  Goodbye, Papa, please pray for me  Oh, no, an early death  I was the black sheep of the family 
[03:09:30]  Oh, boy, oh, no  You tried to teach me right from wrong  You disciplined me with your veiny dong  It's over, Jenny  Goodbye, Papa, it's hard to die  It's over, Jenny  You can act like a man  Look out  That's terrific  That's terrific  We're tanks for nothing 
[03:10:00]  When you see them, I'll be there  We had joy, we had fun  We had seasons in the sun  But the wine and the song  Like the seasons have all gone  God damn it, are you fucking with me?  We had fifths in our bums  But the wine and the song  Hello, exactly!  The seasons have all gone  Oh, no, no, no  I'm Michelle, my little one  Ah, the little one  Kid saying goodbye 
[03:10:30]  You gave me love and helped me find the sun  Did your parents have any children to live?  Sir, yes, sir!  How about they regret that?  You would always come around  And get my feet back on the ground  Goodbye, Michelle, it's hard to die  Yes, do it!  When all the birds are singing in the sky  Oh, you little things  You make me want to vomit  Yeah  With the flowers everywhere 
[03:11:00]  Now lean forward and choke yourself  I wish that we could both be there  You're getting the finger-tank  In the old Mary-Kate front spot  To her pretty pink pennies  Are over!  Not gonna beat that one  Pretty fucking tired, sweetheart  You folks fell on your face 
[03:11:30]  That's a hard one  Why is it to keep coming up like this?  You folks fell on your face  No shit  Did the guy die?  Apparently  In real life?  I don't  I don't  His career did  What's that song about?  Can someone get me a bio?  Quick, quick, quick  It's dying  He's saying goodbye to everybody 
[03:12:00]  But is it from someone else's point of view or his?  I don't think it's his  No, it was Terry Jacks  He wasn't dying  But who's who's Michelle?  He named people  So it's gotta be from someone  Yeah, imaginary fan  Goodbye, Michelle, my little one  My little one  Well, that's number five  Most depressing songs of all time  Goodbye, Franny, my neighbor  That's all right  Whose lawnmower I never return  Goodbye, my mailman  Always there for me  Goodbye, milkman  Thanks for the extra cream  We get it  You were loved 
[03:12:30]  That's for tomorrow  Fuck yourself  We'll do that tomorrow  Make sure you remind me  Goodbye, grandmama  And your smelly feet in diapers  Yes, I know Nirvana did a cover of that song  Yes  Did they?  Number four, Anthony  Number four  Jimmy  Most depressing songs ever  Uh, Bonnie Tyler  Total Eclipse of the Heart  What's wrong with that song?  What?  Turn around  Bright eyes  No, which one is that? 
[03:13:00]  Turn around  What's wrong with the song?  Every time I  It's a good song  Something, something  Every time I  Bah, bah, bah, bah  La, la, la, la, la  La  Well, let's see where this goes wrong.  I've heard this song a million times.  I had no idea it was a depressing song.  Shut this cock.  I don't know if I can't hear this.  I thought you were going to start there.  And there. 
[03:13:30]  But not here.  A little bit lonely.  That's her uncle.  Is it a heartbreak or something?  Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears.  Turn around.  You know what it is?  She's really drunk and she's squatting and shitting on the floor and leaning on the toilet with her elbow.  Someone's telling her, hey, turn around. 
[03:14:00]  She's evacuating all over the tiles.  Turn around.  Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears.  Show me how you suck a guy's cock.  It's the last time I'm going to ask you.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Every now and then I get a little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child.  Turn around.  Every now and then I get a little bit angry and I don't know how I can't cry. 
[03:14:30]  Turn around.  Every now and then I get a little bit terrified but then I'll see the look in your eyes.  This lady dies singing to her ex-husband.  Every now and then I'm lying like a child.  Every now and then I fall apart.  Every now and then I fall apart.  Every now and then I fall apart.  And I need you now tonight.  And I need you more than ever. 
[03:15:00]  And if you only hold me tight.  We'll be holding on forever.  And we'll hardly be making it right.  It's just like heartbreak.  We've had a bunch of death and destruction and this is just like heartbreak. 
[03:15:30]  He never turns around.  Who cares?  He don't turn around.  That's the problem.  Bright eyes never turn around.  Is she saying turn around or is the guy saying turn around?  It's like he's saying.  Who's saying it?  Who cares?  But he's going turn around.  Like maybe I'm right here.  I think that's just a thought.  It goes unanswered.  There's no eye contact.  She's the one that's heartbroken.  Why is she calling them bright eyes?  Who is she?  Sinatra?  Turn around, babe.  Turn around, you classy dame.  That's number four.  Fucking asshole she is.  That's number four. 
[03:16:00]  Most depressing songs of all time.  Bonnie Tyler.  Totally clips of the heart.  I'm going to guess that number three is.  All right.  Happy birthday.  To me.  It's somebody called Bobby Goldsboro.  Oh, no.  Which one is this?  Oh, I know what it is.  I know this one.  What's the title?  You're a liar.  Honey, there's a lump on your tit.  What's the title?  It's called Honey.  Honey.  Is it?  I was joking.  Yeah.  It's called Honey.  That was a complete goof.  Honey.  Oh.  And it's about him, I think. 
[03:16:30]  She dies.  She dies.  Honey.  Sure it's not about Steve's lunch?  Honey.  I forgot how the tune of it goes.  If I knew, I would probably know every word.  All right.  Let's take a listen to Bobby Goldsboro.  Honey.  Got it.  Space.  The final frontier.  It goes like Pink Floyd's Money, but instead of Money, they say, Honey.  Honey. 
[03:17:00]  See the tree.  How big is grown, my friend?  It hasn't been too long.  It wasn't big.  I remember this song from when I was a little, little, little kid.  I laughed at her and she got mad.  I punched her in her fucking face for laughing at me.  Because it wouldn't get hard.  I've been drinking, you castrating pig.  She ran out to brush the snow.  You put a few pounds on.  So it wouldn't die.  See, she went to, they planted a tree.  She brushed the snow away so it wouldn't die. 
[03:17:30]  Came running in.  All excited.  All excited.  Slipped and almost hurt herself.  Almost.  Very close.  And I laughed till I cried.  And he laughed at her almost slipping.  That's funny.  She pulled a muscle in her back.  She was always young at heart.  Kind of dumb and kind of smart.  She was an easy lay.  Jesus.  She's a clumsy retard.  A retard.  She'd shit her pants and wave her medals, wear a Pete Rose hairdo, and spoil the family  pictures two years ago.  Jesus. 
[03:18:00]  What else did this enchantress do?  It would sure embarrass her when I came in for working late.  Fucking useless cunt brushing snow off tree roots.  And she'd have peanut butter on herself and the dog was there.  He'd lick her pussy and fuck her throat.  We'd laugh and make eye contact.  Here it is.  And honey, I miss you.  Haven't gotten to the part where she dies yet, though.  Oh, he's singing this to the tree. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And I'd love to be with you.  Then kill yourself.  If only I could.  All right.  I think the death scene's coming.  Uh-oh.  Hold on to your hats.  How'd she die?  She wrecked the car and she was sad and so afraid that I'd be mad.  And I was.  My insurance premiums went up and I had a kicker in the uterus.  It was a Saturn and I couldn't cruise trannies for a while. 
[03:19:00]  She was pinned against a tree, causing a ruckus.  Oh, here she came home unexpectedly.  And caught her crying needlessly.  Yeah.  In the middle of the day.  She's a fucking psychopath retard clumsy bitch.  There was a stewed tomato on the floor.  To repaint that room again.  She went away.  And honey.  Yeah.  She's kind of crying.  And then she drops dead.  She had something, I guess.  I'm being good. 
[03:19:30]  I don't know.  I'd love to be with you, but I'm busy repainting the nursery.  We'll make it an office like we originally planned.  We made the nursery an office and the chick that I was really looking at moved in last night.  I know you've only been gone three days, but what the heck, I got to get over it sometime.  Guys, I want to debut my ringtone.  Oh.  It's all set and ready to go.  You got a ringtone?  E-Rock is calling my phone.  Ooh.  E-Rock. 
[03:20:00]  If this works, I will be the happiest person on the show.  There's the Ben snoring ringtone.  That's good.  It ought to vibrate like Ben's head.  Can I get it louder?  I can see what I can do.  I want the same one on mine.  That is awesome.  I can see what I can do.  Here.  We should all have Ben ringtone.  No, we shouldn't.  Put it loud.  Get to it, Dan. 
[03:20:30]  That rocks.  No, we shouldn't.  Thank you, Danny.  Thank you, sweetie.  So, number three, the most depressing songs of all time.  Let's see it.  Bobby Goldsboro, Honey.  Anthony knew it.  I'm amazed.  When I was growing up, that song was like on the radio when I was a real little kid.  And it was on all the time.  I don't remember that one at all.  And then me and my brother used to make fun of it when we got a little older.  Yeah.  Sort of like we were just making fun of it, make up our own words.  So, she crashed.  I've been doing that shit since I was like four years old.  What?  The lyrics?  Making up just awful words to songs. 
[03:21:00]  So, she crashed a car because she had something wrong with her.  She was home crying and then dropped out.  Yeah, she was home crying apparently as she had something.  Yeah.  And, you know, they never get into it.  Hopefully it was the old news.  All right, the runner-up.  Most depressing songs of all time.  According to this book, I hate myself and want to die.  She wore a robe and drank some broth.  Alice the maid and Sam came home.  But wait, she's not a man.  We have Harry Chapin.  Harry Chapin. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, my God.  Cats in the Cradle.  No.  Taxi.  If it's Taxi over Cats in the Cradle?  No.  Cats in the Cradle.  30,000 pounds of bananas?  I'd never heard of this song either.  Track the trailer on the LIE?  Is it Dreams Go...  Is it Oopsie Daisy Bumper?  Don't tell me it's W-O-L-D or fucking Dreams Go By.  How do you know all these Harry Chapin songs?  I love Harry Chapin.  He was amazing.  I know what it is.  It's fucking...  Wait.  It's not Mr. Tanner. 
[03:22:00]  It's about upstate New York.  It's about the fucking...  I am the midnight watchman down at Miller's Tool and Die.  That's probably the one.  What's so sad about that?  It's about a guy...  He's got a shitty job, but at least he's working.  He has a one-night stand.  He's a very lonely...  A Better Place to Be.  It's called...  Gets the AIDS?  It's a song called The Shortest Story.  Never heard it.  Never heard that.  Same here.  There's no way that's sadder than fucking...  Is it about E-Rock's successes?  No, it's Ben's haircut list. 
[03:22:30]  Verse one goes Lawnmower Blade, and then the chorus is...  Blah, fuck it.  Fade out.  Fucking zilch.  He's probably annoying David Ortiz right now.  Yeah, he's interviewing David Ortiz.  It's like a more...  We better have an engineer down there, because I know Ben.  He'll throw the interview away.  We need the raw...  No, we need it.  All of it.  Unedited.  All right. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, all right.  Very cool.  And now it's very loud.  Could someone call my phone?  I'll do it right now, boss.  Hold on.  Jim Norton calling you.  Give a call.  You just made it really loud, because I wanted to be real loud in the restaurants.  Oh, no.  516.  I dialed it wrong.  Oh, just say it on the air.  No, please don't.  I made a mistake.  You got it there, Jimmy?  Why are you dialing?  How else am I supposed to do it?  Just look at the phone and it'll know? 
[03:23:30]  Oh, just about.  Don't you have my speed dial?  No.  I don't fuck with speed dial.  Here we go.  All right.  That's pretty loud.  Could be louder.  No, it's perfect.  Dan, get to it, please.  Oh, it's horrible.  Hello.  Hello.  It's me.  I'm not going to be in today.  All right. 
[03:24:00]  Thank you.  Thank you, Danny.  You suck this cock.  Let's listen to the short story.  The runner-up is the runner-up of the most depressing song of all time.  Did somebody call you again?  Fucking Logan.  Elo.  Elo called you.  He wanted to hear it again.  What's going on?  All right.  Bye, Elo.  You just called to say have a good show and hear the... 
[03:24:30]  I want to hear it again.  That's going to be the greatest ringtone.  I know.  I wanted a Twitchell's one, but the...  How old?  All right.  How old?  What are you going to make that as?  Make that as...  I'll just load a ton of stuff for you.  Can you load them on there and then we can make them what we want?  Yeah.  Oh, Dan, this is nutty.  I won't be ignored, Dan.  How old is the oldest song on the list?  Are there new ones?  Not really.  Because there's one.  Don't tell me if it's on it or not, but the Christmas Shoes. 
[03:25:00]  Have you heard of that one?  The Maple King song?  Way to fucking wreck the whole bit.  I didn't say...  Give me a clue whether it's...  Way to wreck the whole bit.  I didn't say.  Opie, what did I say?  I said don't say if it's on the list or not.  I couldn't help myself.  Look.  See?  Now look what you did.  Bill Burr's not here, so you decide to be a bit wrecked.  I didn't ruin the bit.  You ruined it by not reacting.  I want to hear the shortest story.  I never heard that Harry Chapin.  All right, let's do Harry Chapin and then, of course, the number one most depressing... 
[03:25:30]  Oh, I ruined the bit.  I love it.  It doesn't matter.  Good.  That's right.  Take out your tissues, you melodramatic jizz buckets at home.  Get ready to dab your eyes.  Flying faggot.  That's right.  Boo fucking hoo.  Let's hear Kenny in Jersey.  Kenny?  Hello.  Hi, Ken.  He wants to play a ringtone for us.  Go, all right?  Hold on.  Why is Fred Berry on CNN in a hat?  Jesus.  Kenny?  I'll try to play it.  Here it goes.  All right.  His ringtone.  There he goes. 
[03:26:00]  No.  Oh, I want that one.  Oh, he's got the Steve on.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I want that.  Grr.  I want to set that as my ringtone.  Love it.  I have a new phone.  All right.  He's...  And then it's like the whole show.  God, we should have went into business, Opie and Anthony Rinkton.  Why don't we?  That's too late.  Rinktones are a thing of the past.  It's a fad, like the hula hoop and the pet rock.  Oh, just when he said that, I said we.  Oh, we.  Let's play the shortest story.  Harry Cameron.  Shortest story. 
[03:26:30]  I've lost his fingers.  Big A's cock.  Is this a real-time story of his life or something? 
[03:27:00]  I'm glad.  Plus the two minutes left.  To be alive.  Oh, I hope there's a fucking small toy involved that shouldn't be eaten.  It is my seventh day.  Oh, no.  I taste the hunger.  The blind string.  The string to the blinds that you're supposed to sniff at the bottom.  That yummy paint chip. 
[03:27:30]  That thing to mama's side.  She squeezes her breasts.  But it has nothing to provide.  She shoots a fart like a whoopee cushion in a kid's face.  What's wrong with mommy?  Is she poor?  Maybe let's daddy these facts.  Maybe the kid wanted to win.  She's a little hungry.  20 days.  I'm funny.  Nothing.  RCS.  20 days. 
[03:28:00]  Mama does not hold me anymore.  Anymore.  I open my mouth, but I am too weak to cry.  Upon me, a bird slowly crawls across the sky.  Why is there nothing now to do but I? 
[03:28:30]  Whoa.  He's ripping off Neil Diamond.  Yeah.  It really does sound a little Neil-ish.  That is not that sad.  Who knows?  The kid had fucking some kind of problem?  No, I think the mother had a problem.  Just neglected him?  Yeah, neglected.  Drug addict, whatever.  But fucking Cats in the Cradle is a much sadder song than that.  Like the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon.  Fucking kid, he teaches him to throw the ball and he went, I want to be like you, dad. 
[03:29:00]  And he's getting fucking fresh.  And he ends up just like his dad.  He's busy.  Being a piece of shit that's too busy to be with his son.  It's just about life getting busy.  He's like, eh.  No, you could take some time.  He long since retired.  My son's moved away.  A man is never a true man unless he spends time with his family.  That's a good point.  But he fucking called him up the other day and the kid's got the flu.  The kid's got the flu.  What are you going to do?  You better get your head and your ass wired together or I will take a giant shit on you.  That's the way you teach your kids. 
[03:29:30]  Time to die.  Die.  The most depressing song you've ever heard.  According to I Hate Myself and I Die.  Can I guess?  Go ahead.  I'm going to guess.  Go ahead, Anthony.  The Christmas shoes.  My daughter married at...  Well, forget it.  Oh.  I didn't say what.  No, I don't...  I never heard Christmas shoes.  It's a song by New Song.  I don't know.  I heard like, you know, Sal. 
[03:30:00]  My mom and Sal.  Yeah.  Sal just will burst into tears spontaneously during this song.  Are you kidding?  Around Christmas.  He's a pretty tough guy.  Yeah, but Sal's just gotten older.  You know, the old days when we used to be out on the boat, he's cruising around the Great  South Bay in this huge sea ray, drinking CCs, getting all hammered, laughing at shit,  who cares, skipping through life with your shoelaces untied, you know?  And now, you know, Christmas shoes come on and, oh, this is so sad. 
[03:30:30]  What's going on?  What's going on?  Ro.  All right, Baldingmore accent.  Baldingmore.  Why don't we listen to a piece of Ro?  That's fucking the accent.  Why don't we listen to a piece of the Christmas Shoes by New Song, all right?  The most depressing song you've ever heard.  Boop-a-doop-a-doop.  Boop-a-doop-a-doop.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone. 
[03:31:00]  I've got this feeling so appealing for us to get together and sing.  Sing.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, banana phone.  It grows in bunches.  I've got my hunches.  It's the best.  Beat the rest.  Cellular, modular, interactive, modular.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ping, pong, ping, pong, ping, pong, ping, banana phone. 
[03:31:30]  It's no baloney  It ain't a pony  My cellular, but an annular phone  Yeah!  Give me a minute.  Give me a minute!  All right.  No, I know the saddest song as voted by.  Blah, blah, blah.  Day is never finished.  Master got me working.  Sunday, Master set me free. 
[03:32:00]  Now listen, you communists and niggers and you.  Tell all your buddies to spread the news.  Today, judgment will soon be nigh.  As the Lord in his wisdom looks down for an eye.  Will his battle be lost by mixing the races?  We want beautiful babies, not ones with brown clays.  Never, never, never, I say.  For the Ku Klux Klan is here to say.  Never, never, never, I say.  Because the Ku Klux Klan is here to say. 
[03:32:30]  That ain't it?  No, I thought it was.  I actually have the most depressing song you've ever heard over here.  All right.  You got a little confused.  Okay.  Here it is.  The house next door to me's been sold to niggers.  They claim to be wild Indians from the plains. 
[03:33:00]  This is not the most depressing song ever.  Oh, but they...  It's the most depressing thing to happen to the neighbor.  That's not right.  That is so wrong.  I mean the house being sold.  I just want to go on record and say that that was suggested by our own true boogie, by the way.  It was not.  Don't lie to us.  I deny everything.  You did not just write that down, huh?  Oh, my God.  Do you have it over there?  Because if you don't, I might have...  I don't think I have it.  I have the most depressing song you've ever heard over here, if you'd like to hear it. 
[03:33:30]  I would certainly would.  I don't think I have it over here. 
[03:34:00]  Yahoo.  Holy shit.  Yahoo, indeed.  Let's go to Zach in Tennessee.  Zach, what's up?  What's up, man?  I have the best ring.  Hold on.  All right.  That's his ringtone.  That's his ringtone.  That is really funny.  Let's go to Mike in Jersey.  Mike has a ringtone for us. 
[03:34:30]  Mike.  Yo, I got a lot of little ringtone.  Here you go.  So, it's coming on at NYU and that good radio.  So, it's pretty cool.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  I don't know how to load ringtone.  This seems like fun now.  I want this to be like my new hobby.  So much fun.  Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff?  Yeah, how about Ramone?  Get the phone.  Yeah, real hit.  Jesus.  Most depressing song.  Oh, you got it here? 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Mama.  Do you know what actually is a very sad song?  Did you ever hear Jim Nabors singing, Oh My Papa?  Oh.  And Thug Eat.  As he gets a cock in his ear.  Doug out, Doug.  It's actually Oh My Papa.  What's up, fellas?  Hey, I got a ringtone suggestion I've been using for my ex-wife now for the past year.  If I could play it.  Sure.  Yes. 
[03:35:30]  That's pretty funny.  That's C-word alert.  That is hilarious.  That could be a big hit.  All right, Doug.  Thank you, doll.  Short and sweet today for Doug.  Doesn't Remembering Lacey rate up there?  Wish we had a copy of that one.  We do.  Remembering Lacey.  Her smile will make you smile. 
[03:36:00]  If I could use the word smile twice like a fucking idiot.  Please, can we play that?  Where is it?  We'll find it.  Please?  We have a happier version of the song.  Here it is.  This is a song some idiot wrote about Lacey Peterson and Lil' Connor.  Are y'all ready, kids?  Aye, aye, captain.  I can't hear you.  Aye, aye, captain.  Oh, who lives in a body bag under the sea. 
[03:36:30]  Lacey Peterson.  Absorbing and bloating and pregnant, was she?  Lacey Peterson.  Where noise-eating, nagging Scott won't miss?  Lacey Peterson.  Her and Connor are food for the fish.  Lacey Peterson.  Lacey Peterson.  Lacey Peterson.  Lacey Peterson.  Lacey Peterson.  Lacey Peterson.  Lacey Peterson.  Lacey Peterson.  Lacey Peterson. 
[03:37:00]  That is so long.  Wow.  Please find, remember, I remember one of the biggest laughs I've had on this show is,  one of the lines is, uh, Mama, this for you, and you said it's a bouquet of seaweed.  That was in that stupid song.  Yeah, Mama, this for you.  This for you.  A bouquet of seaweed.  All right, shut up, you little creepy corpse. 
[03:37:30]  Exactly.  Completely, you fucking perjurya thing.  There is nothing creepier than dead corpse children in movies.  Oh, they're awful.  Nothing creepier.  Oh, we found it?  Oh, here it is.  This, uh, rememberingly.  It's a melodramatic dreck.  It combines awful writing with a horrific death and, uh, uh, horrid vocals and music.  Remembering, Lacey, how her smile would make you smile. 
[03:38:00]  Remembering, Lacey, how she loved, there's no denial.  You get nothing, you lose.  Good day, sir.  And little Connor's with her, too.  And she smiles and says, we're all right, and we send our love to you. 
[03:38:30]  So full of life and happiness was pretty Lacey's life.  Life.  Life twice.  With little Connor on the way, just made things seem so right.  Not for, uh, what was his name there?  Still the two of them together, from the start to heaven's door.  The door.  And she smiles and says, we love you, to the one she's loved before. 
[03:39:00]  It's over, Johnny.  The last time I saw a mouth like that, I had a hook.  Here's that they'll make flowers bloom on earth in heaven, too.  Oh, here it is.  And little Connor runs and picks them.  Mama, these for you.  Now the angels are preparing special tributes from afar.  As you gaze into the heavens. 
[03:39:30]  Look, the Lacey Connor star.  The only star with an anchor on it.  Remembering, Lacey, how her smile would make you smile.  Remembering, Lacey, how she loved, there's no denial.  Now the angels are over gently.  I hope she loves denial.  Because that's what she wanted at the bottom of the tree. 
[03:40:00]  And she smiles and says, we're all right.  And we send our love to you, girl.  That's an intention, get it?  And we send our love to you.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  I love you.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear.  Oh, dear. 
[03:40:30]  What have we got here?  A fucking comedian.  Oh, my God.  Teresa in Florida.  Teresa.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  What do you say, Terry?  Teresa.  Oh, that song was horrible.  There's a sadder song out there than any other song.  It's Flowers for Mama by Red Sovine.  Oh, Flowers for Mama.  Yeah, Flowers for Mama. 
[03:41:00]  By who?  By Red Sovine.  Sovine.  A trucker singer.  I never heard that.  I think that's on truckers and talkers.  How does it go?  Oh, God.  Just a little bit.  I might have heard it.  Can I tell you what it's about?  No, just sing a little.  Oh, just a verse to me.  Who cares?  Just a little verse.  Oh, no.  You guys want to make fun?  No, I actually want to know the song because the title is familiar.  Yeah. 
[03:41:30]  Um, Flowers.  Sing it.  Sing it, Teresa.  Sing it.  Sing it.  It'd be great.  I can't remember the words.  It took me like a half an hour to think of who sung the song.  Someone got a pitch pipe?  You got a pitch pipe?  Clear to feel some men are going to do some drinking.  Go ahead, Teresa.  You can sing it.  All right.  I can't sing it.  Here's Teresa.  She's going to sing a little piece of the song for a while.  And Teresa.  All right.  You're on.  Go.  Just a little bit.  Every second that ticks away is valuable radio time.  Here we go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Teresa.  Flowers from. 
[03:42:00]  Oh, you son of a bitch.  Perfect.  Hope she's still belting it out as a trooper pulls her over.  All right.  Can we hear a.  Yeah, let's hear the number one.  This is new song, The Christmas Shoes.  Let's listen to the most depressing song you've ever heard, according to I Hate Myself and  Want to Die.  This is very touching.  This dumb book. 
[03:42:30]  Aw.  And Sal really cries?  Oh, yeah.  Like by this part, he'll be bawling.  Christmas Shoes by Paul McCartney.  Christmas Shoe.  It was almost Christmas time.  And there I stood in another land.  Trying to buy that last gift or two.  Not really in the Christmas mood.  Because I'm a Jew.  Standing right at the front of me. 
[03:43:00]  What's up?  Little boy waiting anxiously.  Oh, what's wrong with the boy?  Hacing round like a little boy.  That's right.  Child molester.  And in his hands he held a pair of shoes.  A pair of shoes.  The kid's got some shoes.  And his clothes were worn and old.  Yeah, old.  He was dirty from head to toe.  And when it came time to pay, I couldn't believe what I heard him say. 
[03:43:30]  Here it is.  Hold on to your hats, kid.  Sir, I want to buy these shoes.  Yeah.  For my mama, please.  Please.  It's Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her size.  Could you hurry soon?  Hurry.  Daddy says there's not much time.  Not much time.  You see, she's been safe for quite a while.  I know these shoes will make a smile. 
[03:44:00]  If she won't be needing new shoes, then will she?  Why don't you buy her a Christmas diaper?  How about a New Year's Eve satin pillow?  He wants the shoes, so she has nice shoes.  Oh, fuck.  I'm stealing like the black kids do.  Now he's looking at the guy. 
[03:44:30]  Mama made Christmas good at our house.  Most years she just did without.  Tell me, sir, what am I going to do?  So how am I out of my life?  Here's what he told him.  You had best not fuck yourself or I will unscrew your head and check down your neck.  So I laid the money down.  I just had to help him out.  And I'll never forget the look on his face.  What'd he say? 
[03:45:00]  Mama's gonna look so gray.  So gray?  You're a liar!  That's right.  Goddamn liar!  Why, do the shoes match the outfit you're going to bury her in?  Fucking depressing waist.  And these shoes are just her size.  They're just her size.  Could you hurry soon?  Hurry up.  They're small because she's Japanese and Daddy binds her feet with blocks.  You see, she's been sick for quite a while. 
[03:45:30]  No, these shoes will make her smile.  Want her to look beautiful if Mama meets Jesus tonight.  I knew I caught a grab from heaven's love as he thanked me and ran out.  What does Mama have?  You will be molested.  I hope Mama doesn't have cancer. 
[03:46:00]  You should get her a Christmas wig.  What's this all about?  So I wanna buy these.  Why did you do that?  Why did you spend everyone loving me?  As Mama's illness drains the inheritance, you better trip over that Christmas plug.  Would you kindly shut your noise hole?  You see, she's been sick for quite a while. 
[03:46:30]  Yeah, we get it.  Shut up, you damn ass, dog.  She'll make her smile.  What's wrong with her?  You need to shut the fuck up.  Mama meets Jesus tonight.  Sad.  Put on Nikes and then castrate her like fucking Marshall Applewhite.  The shoes so she can catch the spaceship.  This song stinks. 
[03:47:00]  Goddamn rich cunts.  Poor people tend to live in clusters.  Oh, that was like one of those fucking Little Marky songs.  Yeah.  Yeah, let's go to Leroy of Pennsylvania.  Leroy.  Fuck Mama and her new shoes.  They'll just lay there and fucking bum everybody out as usual.  Fuck Mama.  Somebody ought to call Bob Kelly.  She'd be crying right now. 
[03:47:30]  Of course, he's humping a sink.  Mama's a fucking downtrodden cunt with the sniffles.  Trying to tough it out and fucking be sick in January.  Ruined Christmas for everybody.  Exactly.  Self-centered twat, Mama.  All right, well, there you go.  Little kid came and buys shoes.  He should be taught to shop.  If Mama was so good, she would have raised him to shop in November.  Right.  Not Christmas Eve during the rush.  What do you think?  Jesus wants to see someone come up to heaven and fuck me?  Put those away, kid.  They're inappropriate. 
[03:48:00]  They're like fucking Roman sandals where you fucking tie them all the way up.  Horseshoes.  Horseshoes.  She goes up to St. Peter and he won't let her in.  Take off those horseshoes and put on heavenly loafers.  Who gave you those?  We're going to kill him immediately.  The saddest, uh, there it is, song ever.  That song eats ass.  Fucking Christmas shoes.  Oh, fuck yourself.  How about some Christmas socks?  They're cheaper. 
[03:48:30]  The Christmas chemo session.  Exactly.  Get Mama a Christmas bucket to throw them.  Maybe you could, uh, come up with, uh, some better things to spend the money on than shoes.  Of course.  For Mom.  Jeez.  Woo.  It's a little sad.  But yeah, Sal will just lose his mind when that song comes on.  Julie's saying it makes her cry, too.  Oh, yeah?  Did it make her cry?  Julie?  Yes?  You okay?  No, it used to make me cry, guys. 
[03:49:00]  Now every time I hear it, I'm going to laugh my ass off.  Yeah, exactly.  Why did that song make you cry, though?  It's, it's a little boy who was trying to buy shoes for his mom.  He's a douche.  Infused little kid.  Exactly.  And Jesus is going to give a shit about her shoes.  Exactly.  As soon as you heard that song, all my friends called me, and they were like, there's the  goofy song that makes you cry.  They were all making fun of me, and now I can't help but laugh when I hear it because  of you guys.  Yeah.  Because you guys ripped it to shreds.  Christmas Jews.  It's just about a kid with a menorah opening a shitty gift on the eighth day. 
[03:49:30]  You guys are horrible.  You always wanted to buy his mom some shoes.  It's such a depressing song.  I can't believe you don't see that.  No, it's fucking dumb.  It's supposed to tug at my heartstrings.  Go fucking.  Mama's shoes.  All right, Julie.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Give mama some flip-flops.  All right, we should take a break.  We've been at it about an hour. 
[03:50:00]  There's the guy behind the counter.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Yeah.  Poor kid.  Fuck him.  Spoiled boy.  Go, go, go, Ben.  Go, Ben.  He's like a tall six-year-old.  With hair that was combed with a rake and a hammer.  Calm your hair, stupid.  Go, Ben.  Doesn't matter what he's doing, he'll just walk around going,  E-Raw.  E-Raw.  Tell him.  E-Raw. 
[03:50:30]  Ben looks like poorly spliced film.  An old Ben.  Ben, our producer.  You'll see him at his email.  Highlighting text.  And then unhighlighting it.  Highlighting it.  Scroll.  Scroll.  Highlight.  Unhighlighting text.  Sweetheart.  Love in the front.  I want Ben to wear saran wrap slash with no underpants.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Hilarious.  Burn, burn. 
[03:51:00]  Burn, burn.  Yes,ior ERR than the room.  Burn.  Burn.  Burn.  Burn.  Burn.  Burn.  Burn.  Burn.  Burn.  Burn.  All right, you're checking out the O.B. and Anthony program. 
[03:51:30]  We've got to go sleepy soon.  It is so sleepy time.  It's sleepy day.  That Hannity taping took a lot out of me.  I've got a big meeting at noon.  What do you got?  I've got meetings with people.  We've got meetings tomorrow, so I need a good night's sleep, a good day's and afternoon's sleep.  You know what I'm going to do when I go home?  I'm going to give you my rundown.  I'm going home.  I'm going right into bed.  It will probably be like noon-ish.  I will be in bed for the night. 
[03:52:00]  I will go through some Sopranos, the Sopranos that I missed, maybe watch a movie, and then fall asleep.  Whatever time I fall asleep, that's it for the night.  I will sleep the entire day.  I can't function like this.  It's fun and everything.  I think we have a lot of fun, and we get goofy, and that's kind of funny when we're really sleepy.  But you can't live a life like that.  I'm like that every day.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, you are.  You are.  What's this song for Jimmy?  Uh-oh.  Remembering Jimmy, his smile would make me smile.  Did we play this yet?  I don't know.  Jimmy, breathe right, star.  EMC2.  EMC.  EMC2, records from Nashville.  It's Wes.  A song for Jimmy.  A song for Jimmy.  I don't know what this is. 
[03:53:00]  Bam, bam, bam, bam.  Steve just throws this stuff in front of us, and we're supposed to...  We should ask him if it's funny.  Well, you know, he was sent to my listeners.  Well, somebody sent it.  It could be funny.  It could be awful.  If it's funny, it would be...  If it's awful, it was them.  Get Steve.  Iraq recommended it.  Steve, is this funny?  Steve, funny?  We're really tired.  Jimmy's song?  No, it's not funny, but it's...  Why would you submit it?  What?  It's a song about you, fella, and it's well done.  Did you get hit in the eye?  No, I cut myself.  How?  Doing what?  With shaving myself quickly. 
[03:53:30]  He's one of these guys that's got to shave all the way up to his eyes.  He's got to shave up to his retina.  I would absolutely tell you if that was the case, but it isn't.  I was just being very sloppy, and it was early.  And I whacked myself with one of those Mach 3 razors, so I had three...  How do you fucking cut yourself on your upper cheek?  Do you shave while you're dancing?  As a matter of fact, that's a little high.  That's a little high up there.  That is high.  Were you eating lunch, and you went to swat a bee that landed on your face, and you clawed yourself?  That's like when you laugh, it goes right up your appley cheek to your bottom eyelid. 
[03:54:00]  I know.  It's red.  Don't pick it.  You should pick it.  Don't pick at it.  I hope it gets infected.  His face rots off.  Good.  Can I nuzzle with you when that happens?  Of course you can.  Who did this song, Wes, from...  Wes, he works at a record label down in Nashville.  All right, let's take a listen.  Is this a song for Jeremy?  Yeah.  Better be good.  Well done, according to...  Well done.  I had him send a lyric sheet, because the lyrics are...  He's a distortion filter on his voice.  Oh, boy.  Why would you do that on a song where you want people to hear the words? 
[03:54:30]  Exactly.  So where are the lyrics?  I thought I put them in front of you.  Well, we think different.  Well, I'll get them for you.  You may have thought wrong.  Well, it was also like a week ago that I brought that in, so...  Oh, hey, that was a little bit...  Oh, oh, oh.  A little something.  You gotta catch them when you can.  Those little things.  Well, a week ago when I brought it in, that was...  Hey, Opie, go fuck yourself.  It was sitting there a week.  Slam on the headphones.  Yeah.  Headphones are dropped, and he leaves the studio.  That's the words, you Nancy. 
[03:55:00]  That's really well done so far.  I am Iron Man.  I like it.  It sucks, cop, when the monsters start to rain.  He wants a picture if you've ever seen some pain.  He has a collection that'll make you go blind.  He'll block any fat pussy he can find.  His body's in the shape of a pear. 
[03:55:30]  He'll creep you out with his crazy-looking stare.  He crawls his path like you wish that you were dead.  I didn't understand that forest part. 
[03:56:00]  He wowed once, and he thinks he's in love.  If you touch his keyboard, need to wear a glove.  The only fuck of girls that like to work the streets.  Some Reynolds-Rabbing Java logs are a treat.  Don't eat a bit, Saturn's how he likes to roll. 
[03:56:30]  Straight-up missionaries, way too dull.  When he was young, he had imaginary friends.  Jim Norton's gig's never seen the end.  It's amazing that he don't have AIDS.  He's on a channel, but he don't get paid.  He stinks, and I don't like it.  You don't know what buddy's got in mind.  Little Jimmy's on a way.  I'm not digging it. 
[03:57:00]  Sorry.  I mean, I know it seems like they put a lot of work into it.  It kind of sounds cool and stuff.  It's no White Unicorn by Wolfmutter.  I hope right now Steve is slamming his hands in a door by accident.  That was, you know...  A bad joke.  It was...  It was aight.  It was aight.  It was just aight, bro.  It was just aight.  Yeah.  By the way, what happened?  Chris Daughtry's all over TV today.  He's in New York doing press, and we didn't get him. 
[03:57:30]  Why?  Big supporters of Chris Daughtry.  How did that happen?  And we've been trying to get Simon on.  We need the American Idol guy.  I think we will.  All right.  They're working on it.  Jimmy, you all right?  Someone's calling.  Who's calling?  Ooh.  Important stuff?  Yeah.  I like your ring.  Me too.  It's nostalgic.  Number please.  I think we have to cut out.  No, I think we should do a little half hour. 
[03:58:00]  I got time.  No.  How about no extra show today?  No, I don't like that.  Because even when Opie says...  Sometimes Opie or Jimmy or anybody will say,  you know, we're just going to leave today.  No extra show.  And we wind up staying until like a quarter after or something.  I say no extra show.  It's too late.  It's too late.  I'd like to see some extra show.  I love extra show.  Indie Mike is on the phone.  Indie Mike.  Indie Mike.  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Hi.  What are you calling about today?  Well, I was calling to say welcome to bonus time, 
[03:58:30]  but it may be a very short bonus time from what I hear.  We are officially in bonus time.  So I could just leave.  Yeah.  We don't get paid for this.  I could just walk out.  You guys hang if you want.  I dare you to leave.  I wouldn't leave.  It would be the most despicable thing said about me.  I'm too paranoid to leave.  All the way home, you'd be hearing Anthony's a faggot.  Oh, it would just be the worst.  Hit a pole.  I couldn't leave you idiots alone.  Just do it. 
[03:59:00]  No.  Just see what happens.  I can't.  I can't.  Yes, you can.  Just go.  I'm too paranoid.  Just go.  And it would just take too long for me to get to the car,  and I'd be wondering what you're saying before I got to the car.  You'd hear it in the replay?  It would.  Ah, I'd hear it in the replay at home.  I'd be all, like, hot.  But he would avoid the replay.  I'd get all hot and embarrassed and red.  Would you?  Yeah.  Not in a good way.  Anthony took a nice dump before, too, apparently, right?  Uh, yeah, I thought it was going to be a little bit of a mess,  but it ended up being very torpedo-like, quick delivery, which is always good. 
[03:59:30]  You don't want to be sitting there, you know, when it's showtime  and have to worry about clean up and things like that.  All right.  Someone give us a really good request,  something we haven't played in a while to start off this bonus time.  Let me see.  Oh, my God.  What?  Thanks.  These are the lyrics from Steve.  Oh, good.  Just in time.  Let's go to Tony in St. Louis.  Tony.  Hey, Tony.  Hey, uh, I just wanted to put in my vote for, uh, no extra show.  You dullards need a nap.  Yeah, we're tired. 
[04:00:00]  Dullards.  I'm tuckered out.  We taped, uh, Hannity and Combs last night.  It's going to be on Friday, but, uh, we had to stay up really late to do it.  All right.  We'll go tuckered at home.  We'll see you guys later.  I'm tuckered out.  All right, Tony.  Thank you.  Thanks, Tony.  I'm not horny.  Jimmy's just laying down, feet up, asleep.  I'm packing, like, half a ride because I'm so tired.  And you're, like, you got your eyes half shut.  You're manipulating your own penis.  James.  That song made him recline. 
[04:00:30]  Yeah.  James in Illinois want to say that this show is confusing.  Yeah.  Oh, I would like to have, uh, heard that.  Why?  And, yeah, that would have been nice.  I hope the reason it hung up is somebody punched the phone out of his hand into his ear.  I don't know why I wish violence on people.  I don't like violence.  Dan, what's up?  You can come along.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hi.  Hey.  I was wondering if you guys wanted to play, uh, the Kaplan Brothers' Silence of the Lambs musical.  Oh, yeah, man.  Maybe some put the rubs of those shenanigans.  We've played that a lot, though.  We do like that, haven't we?  I've not heard that.  Never play it.  Yeah, we do kind of play that. 
[04:01:00]  Or Pat O'Brien, someone.  Ah, fuck you, then.  I like this guy.  All right, now we've got balls.  All right, we'll play it.  Which one do you want to hear?  You want to hear from...  Shut up, Jimmy.  You're making us all tired.  Take the solutions.  Yeah.  What we haven't played in a while is Siskel and Ebert.  Oh, the Siskel and Ebert little tapes?  Yeah, but then we'd have to explain it.  Yeah, fuck it.  It's not a hard way to explain.  You just put it on. 
[04:01:30]  What happens is the one guy sneezes, and you hear chuk-chuk-chuk-chuk-chuk, and you realize  it's the rattling of pudding in the head.  Chuk-chuk-chuk-chuk-chuk.  Oh.  Jimmy just lit.  Jimmy's a mess.  I'm tired.  He had a great show today, and now he's crashing.  Now he's crashed.  I'm crashing.  I want a girlfriend.  That's what happened.  I didn't have my smoothie because I thought there would be a smoothie problem in the bathroom.  I'm lonely.  So I didn't get the protein pick-me-up that I get from the smoothie.  We were up late. 
[04:02:00]  It helps, right?  How many more excuses can I make for being really tired and wanting to leave?  We really got a bail.  I'm just tired because I was out doing shows last night, and I didn't nap properly.  Who's this?  Could it be because I'm not helping?  No.  No, that never makes us tired.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jerry in Pennsylvania.  Jerry?  Hey, what's going on?  All right.  Baby girl just took her top completely off.  That might help.  Oh, she's got lovely bosoms.  Is she putting it back on?  No, I hope not.  Yeah, she just likes to change this shirt. 
[04:02:30]  Oh, baby girl.  Your bosoms are lovely.  They're sweet.  If I ever got a hold of those things, I would just shake them and go.  Jerry?  Yo, what's going on, LA?  Hey, Jerry.  How you doing, Jimmy?  Better now that you called, Jer.  Yeah, I know.  I have no energy.  I'm a fucking pathetic piece of shit.  I know.  What's going on?  I'd say it before you guys said it.  No, you're all right.  I was going to say you guys should go home early, but leave Jimmy there to test all the  equipment and make sure it works finally.  All right. 
[04:03:00]  We're going to hear a cool sound.  This is the microphone on my cock.  This is not a cool sound.  It is gay.  All right, and I are going to leave, and Jimmy's just going to have to lay back.  I'll just sniffle into the microphone.  All right.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow. 
[04:03:30]  Jimmy. 
[04:04:00]  Jimmy, you can go home now.  Who's there?  Jimmy.  Don't do that to me.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy, wake up.  It's time for the show.  I don't have my pants on, girlfriend.  Jimmy.  It's five to six.  It's time for the show.  I don't know why it tastes so good. 
[04:04:30]  Jimmy.  What a penis.  Jimmy.  Uh-huh.  Do my whiskers give you a rash?  Oh, my God, my Peter.  Jimmy.  Uh-huh.  Are you awake?  Pants of faggot.  Jimmy. 
[04:05:00]  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Jimmy, roll over, but it's our little secret.  I'm scared.  There's nothing to be scared of.  Okay.  Your poopy might hurt for a couple of days.  Huh?  Again.  I don't like when there's blood in it.  Jesus. 
[04:05:30]  I'm tapping out.  It looks like dark cherry chocolate in the toilet.  Hey, it's a chocolate-covered cherry.  All right.  I'm getting out of here.  Let's see.  I'm done.  Tired.  Hey, where's my wallet?  Where's my wallet?  Where's my wallet?  Where's my wallet? 
[04:06:00]  Frozen in rosin from five billion B.C.  It's in a tar pit.  Good.  Good day.  Bad smell, bad language, and now bad jokes.  This is the freakiest show I've ever been party to.  Because we're perverts.  Really?  Stupid.  So you know it's good.  That's why we love doing this radio show.  Right?  Okay, terrific.  I'm going to put your mouth where a ball is on. 
[04:06:30]  Buckle up, kids.  It's cool.  Let's just put it this way.  Sexual harassment mostly.  Just shut up.  I was so offended.  No, listen, you twat.  Hit her over the head with a shovel.  If you did that, I would make love to you right now.  Come on.  People that get their news from O&A are the same people who watched Sesame Street until  they were 12.  Yes, precisely.  Guys talk about nasty stuff like this all the time.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats, because here comes a home run.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
