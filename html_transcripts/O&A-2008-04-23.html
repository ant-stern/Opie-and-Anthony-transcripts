<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie (Greg Opie Hughes) furiously reacting to a New York Post Page Six article claiming the existence of a sex tape featuring his fiancée.  He vehemently denied the allegations, blaming a disgruntled, recently fired former employee who, over a year and a half, had subjected him to hundreds of threatening texts and calls. Opie detailed the employee's alleged substance abuse problems and hinted at impending legal action.  He offered a $100,000 reward for a copy of the supposed tape to prove its non-existence, further criticizing the journalist Chauncey Hayden for publishing the false story.  The hosts also briefly mocked Hillary Clinton's Pennsylvania primary win and commented on Newark, New Jersey's brief respite from homicides followed by a renewed spate of shootings.  Big A was present in the studio, having just eaten an oyster.  An upcoming Saturday Night Virus broadcast with “surprises” was also mentioned. The overall tone was aggressive and punctuated by frequent profanity.

The show continued with in-studio guests Colin Quinn and Jimmy Norton. Opie again addressed the Page Six article, reiterating his belief that the story originated from a disgruntled former employee who allegedly collaborated with another ex-employee and Chauncey Hayden, whom Opie accused of harboring a personal vendetta.  He expressed his frustration with Page Six and Richard Johnson, whom he believed to be biased against the show.  The conversation frequently veered off-topic.  Segments included clips from a previous show featuring Rich Voss’s poorly acted scene from *A Bronx Tale* with Chaz Palminteri (followed by the original scene for comparison), a discussion of Anthony Cumia's gun ownership, a story about a Florida woman's alligator encounter, and a Brazilian priest's ill-fated balloon flight. Opie also discussed his long-standing habit of picking at scabs on his hand and his recent dermatologist visit.  The segment, like the rest of the show, was replete with vulgar language and off-color jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Intimists DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  We got Big A in studio. He's got the tongue scraper.  He just scraped down an oyster.  Iraq, get in there for a sniff of that sample.  Opie and Anthony.  Why don't you shut up?  Shut up! Shut up! Shut the f**k! 
[00:01:00]  This is where entertainment is going.  Would you reenact baby diaper mustache and tippy-tombs underpants?  Sure. Oh, no, you wouldn't.  It's like the underpants were dyed brown.  All right, open them up.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee! Wee! 
[00:01:30]  Good morning. Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning.  How's everybody today?  Fantastical.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Where to begin today?  More disgruntled employees going after me. 
[00:02:00]  What a surprise.  Disgruntled.  And they wonder why they're not part of the Opie and Anthony show.  I'll admit this much.  I'm stupid.  I hire bad people.  Really bad people.  Jim Norton?  No.  Oh.  E-Rock?  No.  Ah. 
[00:02:30]  Uh...  Steve?  No.  Oh, a little delay there.  Yeah.  Oh.  I'm teasing, Stephen.  You said bad, not incompetent.  What'd you say?  You said bad.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  I've got a wrist thing on my wrist.  Oh, God.  Gotta deal with more crap.  More crap.  That's a...  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  I'd like to consider myself...  Yes, Anthony.  ...a gruntled employee.  A gruntled?  I'm a gruntled employee.  Now I have to look up gruntled.  What does that mean?  I'm not disgruntled.  I'm pretty gruntled.  Is that good?  On a daily basis.  I have no idea.  I don't know what disgruntled...  I don't know if you could break it down to gruntled.  But I like it.  Well, it looks like a bunch of my haters got together.  Had a little coffee clutch.  And whipped up a doozy today. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, Lulu!  Whipped up a fine doozy.  Oh, boy, are they going to wish...  They never decide to do this one.  Yikes!  Boy, are they going to wish they never did this one.  I think some people finally went over that line where it becomes something that you can  actually take legal action on.  It's already begun.  Yeah.  It's already begun.  The ball's rolling. 
[00:04:00]  It's already begun.  Basically, there's claims this morning that my lovely fiancée is starring in a sex tape.  That old gag.  Yeah.  Well, sex tape's all the rage these days.  Oh, they sure are.  All the rage.  So if somebody can say that they have one, people are going to just jump on it and think,  oh, this is great.  I was holding back my sex tape, just waiting for the day when, you know, we really need 
[00:04:30]  a bit of publicity.  A little publicity.  I know.  Coincidentally enough, it's the same one as my sex tape.  Right.  Just the two of you in front of a cracker.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Why not?  So, obviously, my fiancée did not star in a sex tape before she met me, okay?  Yeah.  This is pure fabrication.  And people are in serious, serious trouble now because they went over the line.  I can tell you this much.  There's been a few people that have been let go from this radio show over the years, and 
[00:05:00]  then they turn around and they get very, very disgruntled.  Disgruntled.  And then they want to punch back and fight back.  As opposed to gruntled, which is an adjective meaning pleased or happy.  Right.  I'm pretty gruntled.  Ah.  Opie's disgruntled today.  Ah.  With good reason.  I'm not disgruntled.  I'm frustrated because you got a paper like the New York Post.  You know, obviously, the New York Post doesn't like the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:05:30]  Well, that's obvious.  Obviously, they have connections to another huge radio show.  And so when these rumors start making their way around, of course, they get really, really  excited because they think they finally got us.  Right.  And I'm here to tell you today that they don't have us once again.  This is fabrication.  And I would love to mention the employee's name at this point, but I will not.  Oh, it will be mentioned in documents, let's say. 
[00:06:00]  The faithful listeners of the Opie and Anthony show know exactly which employee this is, okay?  Mm-hmm.  There was an employee that was let go a while ago, and he decided to take it upon himself  to completely, completely harass me.  Yeah.  Completely harass me.  We're talking hundreds and hundreds of text messages around the clock.  Yeah.  The person doesn't sleep because he has maybe his own issues.  Yes.  Phone calls all hours of the night, the day, around-the-clock harassment, okay? 
[00:06:30]  I have seen over the years, especially back in the 80s, I've seen people that have issues  with cocaine, and there were some people that were working for this show that did show signs  that I felt was from cocaine use. 
[00:07:00]  It just, it absolutely looked that way to me.  Right.  And there was a lot of speculation as far as that goes.  Uh, that actually was an issue, a problem, uh, and, uh, that person is no longer working  for this program, and like Opie said, disgruntled, bitter, angry, harassing.  And the funny thing about this employee, I pretty much saved his job three or four times 
[00:07:30]  because this is what drives me insane, by the way.  This was a guy that needed a lot of help.  I don't know why, I don't know, I honestly don't know, I never saw anything myself, but  there were obviously some kind of issues with this person.  And, uh, the company, XM at the time, wanted to fire this guy on three or four occasions  because he just wasn't doing the job.  Yeah.  I went to the bosses, and I saved his job on numerous occasions, and this is what drives 
[00:08:00]  me insane.  I was witness to this many times.  And then, finally, there was a, uh, a situation, a lot of this is going to come out, by the way,  but there was a situation where we could not save him anymore because he lied to, he lied  about an incident that went down.  Mm-hmm.  That was a pretty serious incident.  Yeah.  And then it was taken out of my hands, and I'm like, look, you cannot save this person  anymore.  More.  Yeah.  It went up to the top, and the top said, this person has to go. 
[00:08:30]  And I didn't do the firing, matter of fact.  No.  Okay?  And he, he was fired.  He turns around, and he blamed me.  Mm-hmm.  Which, which is completely insane, because you know what?  It's time to tear down a lot of walls today.  I, I'm a complete a-hole on the air.  Absolutely.  I'll be the first to admit it.  But a lot of people don't really know, you know, what I'm like when I'm not doing the  radio show.  And I think a lot of people would be very, very surprised.  Okay?  And so for this guy to come after me when I was looking after his best interest and, 
[00:09:00]  and saved his ass on numerous occasions just, just blows my mind.  Mm-hmm.  Blows my mind.  Okay?  And I, I, I took the high road, and I'm like, oh, you know, and, and I, I, I allowed  him to call me, and harass me, and send text, text messages, and then I got.  At all hours.  And then I got some of our mutual friends to talk to him, and like, dude, this is a  bad place you're going down.  What's up?  You know, the guy was nothing but nice to you, and really, you know, saved your ass 
[00:09:30]  on many occasions, and also taught you how to do effing radio, and, and you should be  able to just get another job and move on.  But that wasn't good enough for this, uh, person, for whatever is going on in his sick  head.  Okay?  So then, uh, we couldn't get him to stop by using mutual friends, and then, because we  tried to get him to stop, the, the text messages, the phone calls, the harassment, uh, escalated  big time.  Big time.  Yeah.  I was able to get some lawyers involved from, uh, from XM to, to calm him the F down, because 
[00:10:00]  I, I saved every text message, and some of them were brutal.  Some of them were threatening me physically, some were hinting that, uh, that, uh, I was  going to be killed.  Just, just insane, insane text messages.  Ramblings of a madman.  Insane.  So we were able to, like, and, and, and, and let it be, uh, you know, known, there was  no, um, there was no, what, what, what's that order of protection thing?  There was no, uh, uh, help me out.  Oh, restraining order.  There was no restraining order or anything. 
[00:10:30]  The lawyers were able to make him understand that this is a really, really bad road you're  going down.  Right.  And then somewhere in those text messages, he decided to start, uh, texting me that he  has a sex tape.  Yeah.  This is over, this is over a year and a half ago.  And let it also be known that, uh, there was constantly fabrications coming out of this  guy's mouth, constantly coming up with these stories that just were complete bulk. 
[00:11:00]  I mean, just, you'd listen to him and go, oh my God, this is, this is a lie.  Right.  You know, the guy is, is blatantly lying.  Right.  And you just would look in shock that the person is, is just so blatantly lying to you.  So then, yeah, he comes out with this, uh, uh, doozy.  Well, this started a year and a half ago.  Yeah.  A year and a half ago.  Started sending me text messages that he has some kind of sex tape.  He was trying to get me to react.  I, and I didn't, I never wrote him back. 
[00:11:30]  I never wrote him back.  I never called him back because I know, I know it's just not true.  Right.  And I thought we were done with this, uh, stupidity, but then, uh, the New York post decided to,  uh, to print a pretty outrageous rumor today.  And now all hell is going to break loose.  All hell is going to break loose.  Yeah.  Okay.  Just go balls out on him now.  Completely balls out.  You think if there was some kind of sex tape that starred someone very close to this radio 
[00:12:00]  show, it would have been out there already.  Especially, especially if, if some douche like, uh, that had possession of it, he's not the  type of guy that is sensible enough in, in a ridiculous way, sensible enough to actually  hold onto it and, and try to get money for it.  And, and, you know, he would have put it out just to screw you over, uh, years ago. 
[00:12:30]  This person doesn't need money.  This person, uh, has a lot of daddy's money.  And when daddy gets his phone call today, he is not going to be happy whatsoever.  Cause it could take down daddy's business as well.  Yeah.  Cause I'm not sitting back and taking this one lightly.  Simple as that.  Simple as that.  No.  And for everybody out there, you know, having fun reporting and talking about this, you  better be careful.  Yeah.  Why didn't they contact you?  Cause when it's, they didn't contact me.  The article says that, uh, calls to, uh, my rep went on, uh, on return. 
[00:13:00]  This Chauncey Hayden has had it out for me for a long effing time cause I have no respect  for the guy.  He's a horrible journalist.  He's not a journalist.  He's a douche with an agenda who, who comes up with a lots and lots of lies on a daily  basis, uh, basis.  A lot of celebrities have complained about his interviewing style and how he just makes  up crap and takes anyone's word for it without checking facts.  I mean, there are things attributed in that article, uh, uh, that you're, you know, taking 
[00:13:30]  a legal action already.  I haven't even thought about this thing in a long time.  And that's why, because this, this disgruntled employee is frustrated that I'm not reacting.  So now somehow he was able to, you know, the, to get Chauncey Hayden and, and, and the  post involved.  Yeah.  And a CW 11 news, by the way.  Well, they're, they're, uh, they're in deep S too.  And how about the fact that they don't know, uh, how to get in touch with you?  Wouldn't you want the other side of the story? 
[00:14:00]  Dude, I'll have my own statement today.  No problem.  No effing problem.  There is no tape.  And the frustrating part about this, it's in print.  It's in print.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's right there in print.  It just doesn't make a, and the funny thing is, uh, any sense.  This is what makes it even more interesting.  The sex tape, uh, starring my fiance, which is not real, uh, is her and Bam Margera.  Right.  Someone she's never met in her life. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  My chick doesn't want to be a part of this.  I mention her name every once in a while, but that's why I say my girl.  Every once in a while, I'll say her name, you know, but it kind of slips.  I'll say my fiance.  Cause guess what?  In the end, she doesn't want any part of this crap.  She's low key.  Definitely.  Oh man.  I feel sorry for this person.  I feel sorry for this person.  Yeah.  Could have just left it alone. 
[00:15:00]  He needs his attention.  Well, now he's going to get his attention.  No problem.  No problem.  I remember watching you in California talk to Eric Logan on the phone and stop Logan from making a firing.  I've never been able to tell this guy that, but it was, I remember sitting in the back of a car as we were going from one hotel to another.  And you were like, yeah, we were telling her not getting the job done.  And you're like, well, can we just, let's just wait.  Don't make a decision now.  Don't, don't do it.  Yeah.  I physically watched you stop Logan from firing. 
[00:15:30]  I was on many occasions, many occasions.  And then we were even looking into a possible rehab.  If this person had issues and go, well, could he, could he take, could he take some time off to get his act together and then we'll bring him back.  I, I would, I did everything possible for this guy.  And this is talking interventions.  And this is, and this is what I get in return.  When I met this person, he was, he was stuffing envelopes with wow stickers.  I gave him a life. 
[00:16:00]  I gave him a life.  Stuff like Bam's name has been banned on this show.  Has it?  We don't talk about Bam because no one really is talking about Bam.  It's not relevant for the past few years.  No offense to the guy.  I'm actually a fan of his.  So, you know.  But, I mean, part of the article says that, that we banned his name even being mentioned on our show.  What is that about?  Well, we have been told to say kaboom.  Kaboom instead? 
[00:16:30]  You know, even when talking about like explosions.  Oh, God.  Why not call you and say, hey, Greg Opie Hughes.  Here's a story.  We're going with it tomorrow.  Do you have any comment?  Are you indeed taking legal action to try to keep this tape from getting out?  Right.  And then you can go, hey, idiot.  There is no tape.  There is no tape.  Here's my official stance.  There is no tape.  It was a disgruntled employee that if you want to take his word for it and print it, there's going to be consequences. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  And supposedly there might be another disgruntled employee involved that has a relationship with.  With the first disgruntled employee.  Exactly.  Over the years.  Exactly.  And I know why they didn't call me or anything.  I'm not stupid.  You know, when you do this type of show, you're going to get your haters out there.  When you speak your mind and speak honestly and openly, you're going to piss off a lot of people. 
[00:17:30]  And people are going to want to get back at you.  They try to do it all the time.  Yeah.  That's why I know.  They got a little tidbit and they think they got something.  So, of course, they're going to go with it.  Of course.  I got my haters.  I'm not.  You think I go home and I don't know that?  You know, the sad part about it is I could deal with this.  I've been doing radio since I was 18 years old.  But my chick who, you know, she doesn't want to be part of any of this crap. 
[00:18:00]  No.  And this person knew that.  And this person knew this was the way to, you know, to get to me.  Well, you got to me.  I'm so pissed.  Trust me.  Watch what happens next.  Yeah, you probably didn't want to.  Watch what happens next.  Probably didn't want to get to him like this.  Watch what happens next.  Now we're going to have some fun.  Okay?  You know, but my girl's like, you know, people are going to read this.  It's not true.  We know it's not true.  But, you know, people that read this, they're not going to know that. 
[00:18:30]  They're just going to read and believe what they're reading.  Yep.  Jesus.  What a douche.  I can't even tell you how pissed I am.  I'm just, it just, well, it doesn't amaze me, actually.  No.  You know, then you had the other ex-employee, you know, trashing us in Chauncey's, like,  little rag magazine that you'd get for free in bars and restaurants. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  That's how desperate that guy is for attention.  That's how desperate that guy is to get back at us.  For what?  I wouldn't wipe with anything he wrote.  Why is he getting back at us?  He's another guy that had no gig when we hired him.  And we taught him the ropes.  Yeah.  And then trashes us.  So we're mostly, mostly me again.  Yeah.  I showed him how to do this dumb job.  And for the record, he never starved. 
[00:19:30]  When we all got fired, he was getting paid, too.  He didn't get paid as long as Ant and I did, because guess what?  He wasn't that important in the long run.  The company wanted to keep Ant and I from not working, and they did everything in their  powers to do that.  So what they did was they sat us on the beach, it's called, and paid us for two years, three  months.  And I know, in Boohoo, we got paid.  I understand that.  We've been over this a million effing times.  But we could have worked for another company, kicked some serious ass doing radio, and got  paid the exact same money.  And the company knew that. 
[00:20:00]  That's why they sat us.  But they didn't need to sit Rick, because he wasn't that important.  And he knows that.  But he got paid for three or four months, and then he moved on to the next radio gig based  on what he did for our show.  And then moved from Philly back to New York based on our show.  And then from New York, he went out to San Francisco.  The guy never starved.  The guy had a fine career after the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, he just kept screwing up.  And then he finally can't get a job.  So then he comes back and trashes us in some rag effing magazine hoping for attention. 
[00:20:30]  He got attention for five minutes and then alienated himself from everyone in the business.  My only fault is that we hire some bad people.  I mean, they're just bad, bad people.  They got deep issues inside their souls, and this is what happens.  This is what happens in the end.  Yeah.  I mean, Rick, I know because, you know, I was part of this family for a long time.  The guy has major daddy issues, major daddy issues that we had to deal with. 
[00:21:00]  And then this other person, it's been rumored.  Not just by us, by the way.  Pretty much everybody within XM.  A lot of people here at CBS.  We had all gotten together at one point and spoken about an intervention.  Right.  It got that bad.  Right.  There was, you know, apparent signs of all kinds of substance abuses.  Right.  So, obviously, I'm here to say there's no sex tape. 
[00:21:30]  There's absolutely no sex tape.  This has been something that this person tried to start a year and a half ago when he got fired.  And you're not in legal action to try to keep this imaginary tape from being distributed?  Go check the records.  Isn't that public files?  That would be public records.  Go ahead, you scumbags in the media.  Go ahead.  Go do your work.  Go ahead.  Yeah, do a little research.  Go ahead.  Do a little research and check into things. 
[00:22:00]  This has been a rumor for a year and a half.  Message boards went with this rumor for a while.  And that's why I like other message boards than others.  Because they were smart enough to realize this is complete BS.  And coming from a disgruntled employee.  And that's why I do not like certain message boards.  Because you're not fans of this show if you're going to go with these rumors that are obviously not true.  And try to get something going.  When you quote say you're a fan of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  That's why.  Now you know why.  This has been a rumor for a year and a half.  So where is this effing tape?  Where is it?  And this New York Post just prints it just like that.  Just like that.  Go ahead.  Do your research.  There's no legal action stopping this from coming out.  Because there's nothing that's coming out.  Go see if Opie's tried to pay anyone off. 
[00:23:00]  Went to court to try to stop a distribution of some tape that doesn't exist.  It's easy to check.  And Chauncey writes,  Hughes is taking legal action to prevent its distribution.  That's a lie right there.  Apparently he's so distraught he's banned the name Bam from being mentioned on the show.  That's a lie.  Those are lies that are printed.  Those are lies.  They're actionable lies that are printed in the newspaper. 
[00:23:30]  And given as fact by who?  Chauncey Hayden gave that?  Hey, Chauncey.  That's going to be fun.  You know, I hope you're making a little bit of money with that rag, that Kotex with a print in it.  I hope you're making a little bit of cake because I think you're going to need it.  This guy.  Yeah.  Well, and Chauncey's another one that never got the attention from this radio show and it always frustrated him. 
[00:24:00]  You know, the guy that did interview us once back in the day and completely trashed Howard.  Oh, yeah.  In front of us.  And we were like, well, whatever, dude.  That's your issue with him.  You know, we actually kind of like didn't discuss that with him.  You know, when we were interviewing him, we took some shots at Howard back at the time because some crap was going down with us and him.  You know, that's well documented.  Yeah.  And then he gets back on Howard's good side and then starts trashing us.  I'm like, what?  I thought you were saying how great we were.  And we were way better than him.  He would come up with all this crap.  And then right then I knew this guy was a two-faced, you know, liar. 
[00:24:30]  So they all got together and they're having their fun today.  But boy, is it going to get interesting.  Boy, is it going to get interesting.  Why would the Post be so stupid?  I don't know why the New York Post would be so stupid.  I don't know.  I just don't get that.  I don't know.  Yeah, because that's really a lame ass move.  You would think.  The beauty is.  Check your information.  It's easy.  The beauty is.  You're very accessible. 
[00:25:00]  The beauty.  A lot of the quotes in this article, I got the exact quotes from text messages a year  and a half ago.  So I know exactly where this is coming from.  A year and a half.  A year and a half ago.  And believe me, this idiot could not hold on to something for a day if he had it.  For a day he couldn't hold on to it.  This is what the Post I don't get.  It says a disgruntled ex-employee of the radio show duo recently acquired rights to the videos 
[00:25:30]  from Margie.  Like there was some kind of illegal rambling and Bam said, all right, here's the rights  to my thing.  You can.  Who would believe that?  It's idiotic.  Right.  It doesn't make sense.  Why would Bam give the rights to a sex tape to a disgruntled employee of our show?  Yeah.  Doesn't he do a radio show for Sirius?  I don't know.  Right?  So why wouldn't he use that to get some exposure, you dope?  Right.  Wouldn't you think he would say something?  He doesn't give a crap. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, God.  So now I've got to deal with complete lies in the media.  No surprise.  We spent half our show talking about how lame the media is and how they lie through their  teeth on a regular basis.  So no surprise that they're finally trying to come back at us or come back at me or whatever.  Unbelievable.  I just want to make it perfectly clear.  There's absolutely no sex tape, okay?  Yeah.  And I don't even want to turn this into a stunt.  I'll tell you this much. 
[00:26:30]  I'll tell you this much, and it's on record.  I got $100,000 cash.  $100,000 cash.  And this is no radio stunt.  This is real life.  This is real life S, okay?  I got $100,000 in cash that I will bring into this effing studio.  You and because someone's going to confuse this statement, too.  Yeah.  You bring me a copy, a copy of this tape.  That means there could be other copies everywhere else.  Right.  It could be on every website in the world. 
[00:27:00]  All I want is one copy of this so-called sex tape.  I will hand over $100,000 cash.  And this is not a radio bit.  This is real life S.  Just to prove that no one's going to come in with a copy.  This is called putting your money where your effing mouth is.  $100,000 cash for one lousy effing copy of this so-called sex tape from this disgruntled  employee that supposedly he has this.  Yeah.  One. 
[00:27:30]  That's it.  And then you can do whatever the hell you want with the rest of it.  Make the other copies, whatever you want to do.  Make 1,000 copies, give me one.  So, because I don't want people confused.  Well, obviously he's trying to buy the tape.  No, I'm not.  No.  One copy, $100,000 is yours.  And then you can do whatever the hell you want.  I don't think you're going to be having to go to the bank anytime soon.  No S.  Everyone knows how cheap I am.  You think I'm insane.  You think I'm that insane? 
[00:28:00]  You think I'm that insane?  That's how sure I am, okay?  Yeah.  Because you can say, oh, there's no tape, there's no tape, there's no tape, there's no tape.  That's how I prove it.  One copy.  I don't give a crap who you are.  And then this person wonders why, you know.  Why he's alienating himself completely from everybody.  Everybody. 
[00:28:30]  Good job.  And his daddy's going to get a phone call.  I'm sure his daddy's not going to be thrilled on this one.  Oh, not going to be happy.  Especially when this could, you know, could threaten some of his interests.  He's got a lot of interests, too.  He's got a lot of interests.  A lot of money.  Oh, yeah.  Sometimes you're able to, like, take everybody down in lawsuits.  Sometimes it's all connected nicely.  And a moronic son.  Your son. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, God.  All right, good morning.  To all my haters.  Ugh.  Go after yourself.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Shue? 
[00:29:30]  Hello.  Hillary won the primary.  Gives a crap.  She was supposed to win.  She won by 10, though, which sucks.  And then she's, if they say she just won by a teeny bit, they maybe could have dumped her.  She's still in it.  Yeah.  And boy, did she sound so sincere.  Did she?  When, oh, I was listening to the news and it was nothing but, um.  The people have spoken.  We are not going to leave this race.  Like, every inflection in her voice is this phony politician crap. 
[00:30:00]  The only voted for her because she has, like, legs and calves like I'm minor.  They relate to her.  She has outdoorsy legs.  Good birthing hips.  Outdoorsy.  Nice Clydesdale feet.  The people of, like, rural Pennsylvania like a gallon Clydesdale feet.  We like a good strong woman.  Yeesh.  And then she was, like, uh, using one of, uh, Obama's little catchphrases. 
[00:30:30]  Like, yes, we can, or whatever the hell it is.  Whatever the hell it is.  They both got so many slogans.  I don't know what the hell, which one is which.  But she was using his because, you know, she pulled it out.  We got the, uh, victory speech from Hillary Clinton.  Oh, listen to the sincerity.  It's a long road to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, and it runs right through the heart of Pennsylvania.  Now, that's kind of an odd way to drive. 
[00:31:00]  From where?  Exactly.  What if you're in, let's say, South Carolina?  Would you go through Pennsylvania?  No.  No.  That would be silly.  She was supposed to win.  Larry literal.  This is really no big deal.  She was supposed to win this one.  Obama's claiming slight victory because, I mean, she was killing, uh, in Pennsylvania.  But it was 10 points?  That's a lot.  I thought it was closer than that.  I could have actually read that wrong because I'm a dope.  I thought I saw 55 to 45. 
[00:31:30]  Am I right?  Okay, I was right.  Pennsylvania.  Some people counted me out and said to drop out.  But the American people, the American people don't quit, and they deserve a president who  doesn't quit either.  Either.  Can she just talk like a human being?  She stinks.  That fake, like, she can't even, she can't even figure out how to talk to where people 
[00:32:00]  can relate to her, just to her voice.  Like, I don't want to listen to that.  I know when people campaign, they're, they're kind of being showy.  But is that going to be every speech she gives if she does win and she's the president?  Every speech we listen to is going to be that, that stupid cadence and the accents and the,  ugh.  She's horrendous.  She's a phony.  Those dumbbells in Pennsylvania, they would have voted for her anyway.  I think they just like her for labor or whatever more than Obama. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  But I hope throwing back a shot didn't, didn't actually motivate.  Like, are people that unbelievably stupid?  Jeez, look at her, huh?  One of us.  She's pitching one back.  She's a lush.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven, seven, seven, eight.  I was thinking I wanted to hear this.  And on to Penn State, she's...  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  I'm down. 
[00:33:00]  I'm down.  I'm down.  I'm down.  I'm down.  I'm down.  I'm down.  I'm down.  Wow.  She didn't get much of the song out.  She didn't even get to the...  Oh, if you want it, we could.  Oh, no.  That's fine.  Thank you.  All right.  Well, now we have to do it.  Yeah, I love that.  I missed the high part.  Yeah, it is really fun.  All right.  We got the joke in.  Now we get to, you know, piss everyone off.  One, two, three, four, five, six, two thousand, eight, Wisconsin, Ohio. 
[00:33:30]  Here it comes.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  She's going to do it.  Give her just a chance, she'll make it.  Any glass ceiling, she'll break it.  She's going to be your president.  Hillary Clinton.  She bleeds once a month now.  Straight ahead and on the track now.  With plans to make our dreams come true.  Hillary Clinton. 
[00:34:00]  There is nothing she can do.  Never heard the word impossible this time.  There's no time for a chance.  She's going to do it.  On your mark, get set and vote now.  Try to dream and got to know how.  With plans to make our dreams come true.  Working for us all day, yes, all day. 
[00:34:30]  Is she?  Make all our dreams come true.  Working for us all day, yes, all day.  Isn't she still a senator?  I don't think she's been working for us all day.  Doing nothing.  Make all our dreams come true.  She's not a Jew.  She's not a Jew.  You do bring up a good point.  Who's running New York, man?  Who has our interests at hand here while she tries to become the first female president of the United States of America?  And they've taken this campaign has been so long. 
[00:35:00]  So goddamn long.  They started like a year ago.  What is she doing?  Is she still getting paid?  This has been well over a year, a couple of years at this point, right?  So is she still going in and doing her job as senator of New York?  I doubt it.  She's campaigning all the time.  Is she getting paid to be senator?  Who's making a policy for this state?  Like, how is that allowed?  How are you allowed to run once you've been voted in and you're still in office? 
[00:35:30]  To get a better job.  Wouldn't that be good to, like, tell, let's use our show as an example.  Okay.  You tell our bosses here at CBS, look, I know I work here, but I'm going to go work at another radio station for a while because I want a better job.  So I'm just going to go there and try to get a job there, but I still want to get paid.  I'm not going to put on a show for a year and a half.  But that doesn't make sense because we're already the presidents of radio. 
[00:36:00]  Ah, we've reached the pinnacle.  We hold the highest office in the radio land.  Jesus Christ, this is it?  Oh, God.  It doesn't get any better than this.  And that's why they now need to, like, tear us down.  Are we at the tearing down portion of our career?  Yeah, this is what they do.  Know when people wanted to put us up on that pedestal?  This is what they do to everybody that makes it in America.  You know, they allow you to get to extreme heights of fame, and then they have to rip you apart. 
[00:36:30]  Rip you down.  And tear you down and bring you back down to earth.  I think we're in that stage.  That's the stage of our career?  Damn.  Yeah, I think so.  Damn.  But no one has our interests at hand as she's trying to be the president.  That's just amazing.  She thinks she gets voted in and then just doesn't do the job.  So she could run for president.  Right.  Hey, moving on.  There's a fine little, I guess they call it a city.  The only thing we know about this city is we have to go there to take flights out to really nice places in America. 
[00:37:00]  Sometimes if you get a limo driver that, not a limo driver, that was bad.  Actually, I hate limos.  We get a driver that, you know, wants to get you back to Manhattan.  And they decide to go through these streets because they're trying to save five bucks on a toll.  Yeah.  And if you like hockey, you got to go to this little city as well.  We're talking about the great city of Newark. 
[00:37:30]  Newark, New Jersey.  What a fantastic place.  Well, they're bragging today, but then they're not bragging.  Yeah.  Newark hit a record this year.  Six weeks without a homicide.  Six weeks?  So they're celebrating today.  They've gone six weeks without a homicide.  But oops, what happened?  Well, but it's been terrible in the last 36 hours.  They're all making up for six weeks of violence.  So the city wanted to celebrate the fact that the murder rate is way down.  I think they had a parade scheduled and balloons and clowns. 
[00:38:00]  They were really going all out for this one.  And then the last 36 hours kind of just ruined what they wanted to brag about.  Oopsie.  Here's some audio.  Well, it's a city that was hoping to overcome violence here on the streets.  However, that has not really been the case of late.  Look, Newark earlier this year broke a record by going a full six weeks with no homicides.  That ended at the end of February.  And in the last 36 hours, that's gotten much worse. 
[00:38:30]  Some guy was covered in blood.  It looks like he was helping some guy out.  That guy got shot in the face.  A witness talks about a shooting yesterday on Bloomfield Avenue, one of Newark's main streets,  in which three people with no apparent connection to one another got shot in broad daylight in the same incident.  Wow.  Well.  Ooh.  Made up for that.  Those missing homicides.  Yeah.  But then they finish here by saying, even so, Newark is doing better this year. 
[00:39:00]  Is it?  Now, in that incident, none of the injuries was life-threatening, but it came less than 12 hours after two men here in Newark shot and killed each other.  Definitely not good numbers here in Newark.  However, let's take a look at the numbers here in Newark regarding homicides.  There have been 16 of them in this city so far this year, but that's 10 fewer than this point last year. 
[00:39:30]  Hey.  Congrats, Newark.  That's a hell of a butt.  You're doing great.  The second the warmer weather hits is what it is.  Do they just, like, say, well, there's a lot of murder still going on, but...  But, hey, it's less than it was.  Let's turn this into a positive here.  When the weather gets warmer, that's what happens.  People just love killing people in warm weather.  Yeah.  So much nicer.  Let's say hi to Tom in White Plains. 
[00:40:00]  877-212-ON-A is our phone number.  Tom, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Oh, this is Tom Alive.  Yes.  Tom.  Yes.  Oh, what's up, Tom?  Guess he is.  I just want to say, you know, whoever badmouthing you is a complete idiot.  You know, I've known you for, well, listened to you for a couple of years, but known you personally for just, you know, nine months.  Uh, and, uh, who's ever badmouthing you, uh, they're complete morons because, you know, you have your, you know, great persona on, on air. 
[00:40:30]  I love it.  It's great.  You know, I met you and Ant off air and completely different.  The disease has gone to his brain.  I think it's really interesting that, like, his last few breaths he's using to really help my cause.  Yeah.  I got to, I got to, I got to respect. 
[00:41:00]  I've never wanted someone hung up on so badmouthing you guys' lungs are turning into cement in front of our eyes, but you know what?  He's going to, he's going to stick up for, uh, for the show.  God bless you, Tom, from White Plains.  I love the way, the quick, the quick amendment he made.  I've known you, I've listened to you.  Right, right.  Big difference.  Go ahead, Tom.  Sorry.  You should have said, uh, you know, you've been listening a long time and I acknowledged you for maybe, uh, I don't know, for five minutes.  He went to high five him, a traveling virus on the way by? 
[00:41:30]  Tom, you all right?  Yeah, yeah, hanging in there, uh, barely, uh, but, uh.  Oh, barely.  I was just listening to you this morning and I just, it, it, it kind of, uh, upsets me to hear that, you know, people have to attack you, uh.  Well, I'm not, I'm not surprised.  I, I, I understand why this crap, uh, happens, um, and obviously this, this person has deep emotional issues that someday he's going to have to deal with. 
[00:42:00]  You can't avoid it forever, you know, and, uh, you know, this is what you got to deal with, unfortunately.  Yeah.  You know, uh, you know, uh, you know, there's a lot of morons in the world, uh.  All right, Tom, you're making everyone uncomfortable.  I really appreciate you calling me.  Just the way you talk.  Yeah.  You're waxing philosophic.  Yeah.  Uh, a lot of morons in the world.  And I think we met, I think we met you a year ago, man. 
[00:42:30]  You, you've made it another year, Tom.  Congratulations.  Yeah.  Yeah.  July.  Oh, matzo lungs.  Don't laugh.  Don't laugh.  That takes a lot of energy, man.  That was two months off your life right there.  One chuckle.  Right.  Steven has from Basher.  Nine months to Tom equals 17 years.  God, I've known you 17 years, Tom.  Wow.  I was, I was.  It just seems like yesterday.  Yeah. 
[00:43:00]  All right, Tom, hang in there.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Have a great, great one.  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Mike in Newark.  Uh, Mike, what's up?  Uh, nothing much.  Just wanted to say that you guys are great.  Of course we are.  I keep hearing you guys every time I come out of work.  And I live in Newark for all, like, pretty much 18 years that I've been here.  And I'm freaking glad that I keep shooting each other.  It's fantastic.  That's what he means by they.  Where do the, like, real human beings live?  Do you guys, I don't know much about Newark.  Are there actual areas where you're, you feel safe? 
[00:43:30]  Well, the nicest area they have in Newark is called the Ironbound section.  That's pretty much where all the restaurants are at.  They're where the stadium is close by, too.  Right.  And, uh, but then everything else, like, I used to live in Valesburg.  And, uh, Valesburg is pretty, you know, heat up or whatever.  Everybody keeps, uh, killing each other over there.  Right.  And, uh, but Newark, I mean, I love Newark, man.  I have, you know, I've been there for all this time.  And I love it.  You know what I mean? 
[00:44:00]  All right.  Thank you, Mikey.  He loves Newark.  You forget how bad Newark is, because you're right.  We do always use the airport.  It's like, yeah, we're going to, you forget Newark is really a dangerous area.  Well, and I went to, uh, see a hockey game, because the Islanders were playing the Devils.  And they got an amazing new arena.  But they have, you get off the train.  What is it, the path train or something like that, Iraq?  And then they, they pretty much like, uh, like cattle get you from the train station to the  arena for the hockey game.  Literally like they, they march you around the streets like cattle with, with cops on 
[00:44:30]  every corner and with, with directionals and this way to the arena.  They got cones set up.  It's pretty much a wall.  It's a police barricade, uh, five blocks in every direction.  Yeah.  Just so.  All right.  You have to go from here to there.  Don't wander off.  They know.  It's like the green zone in Baghdad, but I guess, right.  Give you a safety zone.  But I guess that's what you got to do, uh, to, you know, to turn around a city, you got  to start somewhere and they decide, look, we're going to build this really nice arena in the  middle of this, this hell hole.  And hopefully that will mean other businesses and hopefully, you know, we could get the crime 
[00:45:00]  and murder rate, uh, way down.  Yeah.  It's the whitest sport on earth too.  It's not like they put like where, you know, where the, I think Jay-Z and moving the next  to Queens or something or Brooklyn, but they should have put a basketball team down there  where you would have had a more mixed group going.  Yeah.  Believe me.  You think that they don't know when the devils are playing?  They just see the 10,000 white people.  Yeah.  They're just waiting for the, the one white person.  Well, whatever.  One, that's to say it.  One white person to wander off.  Of course.  Like he's in the Serengeti. 
[00:45:30]  Everyone else left the watering hole except for one.  Don't happen.  Right.  The cops actually do ask you where you're going if you're not in that area.  Really?  If you start to stray, they say where you're going.  To be killed?  Well, cause that would be horrible if, uh, it hits the paper that someone got,  you know, murdered just going through a freaking devil's game.  Yeah.  So the cops have to work really hard to make sure that doesn't happen.  Yeah.  I'm sure they sat down all the officers and let them in on that one.  Take a bunch of sheep walking through like wolf territory.  Yeah.  Like holding sodas in one hand and little weenies in the other. 
[00:46:00]  Right.  Cash just flying out their pockets.  Right.  All right.  We got to take another break.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Phone number is 877-212-ON-A.  Broadcast program.  Saturday Night Virus.  Hey, Sam.  What's up, dude?  Not much.  Just hanging.  What are you doing this Saturday night?  Oh, I'm doing a radio show with you.  That's right.  Sweet, dude.  Tell them all about it.  Well, it's at 9 o'clock p.m.  and it goes till about midnight and we're going to have lots of cool stuff.  For instance.  Where's my car?  And Tony will also be there with his big date. 
[00:46:30]  Where's your car, dude?  And a couple of other big surprises, I guess.  Dude.  And hopefully no more references to the movie Dude Wears My Car.  You got to learn to roll with me on these, Sam.  Saturday, 9 o'clock.  It's going to be better.  Saturday Night Virus.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  We got a priest that disappeared during a balloon flight. 
[00:47:00]  We'll get to that in a second here.  And also another home invasion.  The home invader might surprise you, though.  Anthony.  Are you doing a news tease?  Absolutely. 
[00:47:30]  That was an exact replica of the stupid news teases.  Absolutely.  Another home invasion.  But the home invader may surprise you.  It will surprise you, Anthony.  What?  But we...  I don't know if you could defend against the home invader in this story.  That's all I'm saying for now.  Really?  Yeah.  It wasn't a...  It's the only thing that would surprise me.  Phone number 877-212-0&A.  Moving right along.  It wasn't.  He had one driving.  Yeah.  It's a different type of show today because I got to deal with some major, major crap. 
[00:48:00]  Major crap.  We talked about this about an hour ago.  And we'll talk about it again, no problem.  Sure.  No effing problem.  But we got a disgruntled employee.  We got many disgruntled employees that just can't move on after the Opie and Anthony show.  I guess we're like their daddies and we have to take care of them for the rest of their lives or something.  Yeah, that's our responsibility, I guess.  It doesn't work out for one reason or another and they just can't move on because that's what happens in life. 
[00:48:30]  You know, you outstay your welcome and you got to move on.  It's happened to all of us.  I've been doing radio a long time and I was in situations where I've been fired.  Guess what?  They didn't want me anymore.  You're not guaranteed a livelihood once you get into any job.  So just like any other job, then you regroup and you figure out what the next move is.  Right.  But for some reason, if you work for the Opie and Anthony show and you get fired or let go or what have you, you have to take it out on Opie and Anthony. 
[00:49:00]  I don't get that.  I sort of get it.  I think one of our faults is that we just hire bad people.  I think we hire people that are damaged psychologically.  And I think I think what happens is it makes for great radio and stuff.  But unfortunately, here's the other side of it.  You get delusional a-holes that get other people believing their lies.  And then it comes together like a nice little cocktail.  And now I got to deal with crap. 
[00:49:30]  That's just not true.  It's a fine line because sometimes the lunatics do make very entertaining radio.  So you kind of go, I'd really like to have that person on board, you know?  Right.  And then they're there.  It's fun.  You could goof on them, you make your jokes.  But then when the situation comes about where they screw up, they get fired, they become these nuts.  They're still lunatics that were, you know, fun on the air to goof on.  But then off the air, it becomes harassment. 
[00:50:00]  Right.  And lies and slander.  We are the radio show that technically, I was going to say hire, but we don't pay her.  Well, we have paid her over the years.  Actually, thousands of dollars it comes out to.  But we basically invited our stalker to be part of the ONA family.  That's how stupid we are.  Yeah.  Like, people like now know Stalker Patty and they love her in the ONA community.  And she posts and she works at Starbucks and she comes in and she's a huge fan. 
[00:50:30]  And the reality is she was a true stalker of me personally and of the show in general.  Any normal person would have had a restraining order put against her and taken all the advice from people as far as stalkers go where you don't have contact with them.  You don't do anything.  But for some reason, we embraced her.  She learned.  She figured out where I lived.  She back in the day, she would follow me to Penn Station on subways.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, I look up and like, what are you doing? 
[00:51:00]  Just taking a ride on the train.  And the first time you give it to that person, I'm like, ah, it's a coincidence.  But then when it happens over and over again, you're like, wow, this person is a bit obsessed.  Yeah.  You know, and then when I moved into New York, there was a Starbucks up in my neighborhood that not many people really go to.  It's not one of these areas of Manhattan that you walk through on a regular basis.  And all of a sudden, I'm in a Starbucks and she's there.  I'm watching you.  But whatever, we've embraced her, but that's how stupid we are.  Yeah.  So we got Rick, you know, just yelling and screaming in a lame little rag magazine that he could get for free in bars and restaurants saying how he wasn't treated right. 
[00:51:30]  And only one of the guys had his back and and and that me, Opie, I'm a well, they couldn't, like, print the word.  So it was either it was I'm a D.  It could be the D for your junk or it could be the D as in chill.  Right.  Or no.  Yeah.  But I mean, just the D by itself.  And then he goes and everyone is scared to say it to him, but I'm not all dramatic in this article, but I'm not scared to say what I'm saying, man. 
[00:52:00]  He didn't say a word down on the sidewalk.  Exactly.  We've said it many times, but like late summer, early fall of last year, the PD, who is completely a waste of space, you know, was was running this place.  And she had a relationship with Rick, who used to work for our show.  So, Rick, make a long story short, was coming into our building to hopefully get a gig.  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  And he ran into Ant and I on the on the sidewalk could have said whatever he wanted to my face.  I was right there.  I was right there.  Right there was the perfect opportunity.  And it was cordial, you know, his small talk.  And then he moved on.  Like, oh, whatever.  I guess he's doing OK with his life.  I don't know what he's up to.  And then fast forward about eight months, he's like trashing us in this this rag magazine and Chauncey Hayden's rag.  That thing should be you know, it should be used for when you take your dog out and he leaves a huge steaming pile of Nagel on the sidewalk. 
[00:53:00]  You just pick it up with that with that rag and throw it away.  Right.  He has dumb eyes over the computer.  Oh, Eric.  He hates that.  By the way, that's the new bit around the office.  A big pile of Nagel.  Yeah.  Whenever you reference crap, just say Nagel.  All of a sudden, you need an email from crap.  Hey, look, I don't appreciate it.  Imagine.  I'm sorry, Eric. 
[00:53:30]  Crap can't.  Imagine.  Oh, the look on his face.  He's not a big deal.  Oh, no.  He is really peeved about this whole bit.  He doesn't like it.  So, Rick had his day in the sun, which completely, like, burns every remaining bridge that he had in this business.  You know, whatever.  Whatever.  But I want to make it perfectly clear.  The guy could have said all that stuff right to my face.  I was right there.  Yeah, I didn't say a word.  You're real brave, Rick.  Real brave.  Real brave.  I was a foot away from you. 
[00:54:00]  You had nothing to say.  And you know that.  And I know that.  So, then it leads us to today, where another disgruntled employee, and I know that this disgruntled employee is in cahoots with another disgruntled employee, believe it or not.  Yeah.  Believe it or not.  And when this person got fired, you're going to hear a lot of the same stuff I said at the 6 o'clock hour, hopefully with a few jokes thrown in.  When this employee got fired about a year and a half ago, he started harassing the hell out of me. 
[00:54:30]  Me.  No one else on the show.  I actually, he harassed a few other people, but not to the extent he was harassing me.  Every once in a while, like, I can't bring names into this right now, but, you know, I know of others that were harassed, but just not to the level I was harassed.  Over and over again, text messages around the clock.  Hundreds, yeah.  Actually, close to a thousand, I would have to say.  I would have to say close to a thousand.  That's pretty wacky.  Close to a few hundred calls easily, a few hundred voicemails. 
[00:55:00]  Just really pissed at me because he got fired from the Opie and Anthony show.  And like I said earlier, what amazes me, and I still don't understand to this day, is why he went after me when I was the one that took it upon myself to really, A, get this guy help, B, save his ass on many occasions because I knew he was going through some issues.  What those issues are, I will go on record.  I really don't know for sure.  I have some pretty good educated guesses. 
[00:55:30]  We all had our theories on what was going on with the guy based on our own life experiences.  You could look around and kind of see what the hell was going on with the guy.  We used to think it was fun when he would exaggerate and tell just amazing lies about a million different celebrities.  And we actually found it fun, fun, but now the lies are coming back to haunt me and I got a major situation to deal with now, which is, which is fine.  I get it.  I'm fine with it.  So he, he just kept harassing, harassing, harassing me. 
[00:56:00]  I didn't get a restraining order, but, uh, but some of the things he was saying, he was saying in the text messages, it was very obvious that he had some major issues.  And we were, we were able to at least say, you really got to stop because this could lead to a really bad place for you personally.  This is not smart.  Even then I was like, this isn't smart.  I could have taken legal actions for some of the stuff he was texting in this thing.  But once again, feeling sorry for somebody, I just was like, ah, no, no, we'll, we'll handle it a different way. 
[00:56:30]  And now I'm kicking myself that I didn't handle it the other way.  And I'm hoping that I can still do it the other way because now it's all out.  Now it's an all out war.  Yeah.  All out.  Now you go.  So during these, uh, text messages that, uh, were around the clock, hundreds, if not close  to a thousand, it's somewhere in there because I wasn't writing him back.  He really wanted to get to me.  He wanted to get to under my skin.  Um, he, he started like hinting that there's a, there's a sex tape starring my now fiance. 
[00:57:00]  And I'm like, Oh God.  All right.  All right.  Boy, I almost said his name.  All right.  And I'm like, Oh my God.  I rolled my eyes and we were even having fun, uh, with it around the office.  And stuff.  Can you believe he's actually doing this?  This is ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  Cause it just fell in line with all of the other, uh, just crap that he'd come up with.  It became a running joke that everything he said was just, uh, was crap.  Like, Oh, uh, guys, uh, Ben Affleck. 
[00:57:30]  I'm going to get Ben Affleck for the show.  Are you?  Right.  Really?  Okay.  Oh, sorry.  We have hundreds of those examples.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it was, it was just like these A-list celebrities and you never saw hide nor hair of them.  Right.  And there were other stories about things and, and promises that were made and just, they  never materialized.  And then we realized, Oh my God, this guy is just like lying at every turn.  Right.  And, and the text messages, he was just trying to get to me, the doing this, doing that, 
[00:58:00]  uh, threatening me with a physical harm, all sorts of crazy ass stuff.  And I should have done something.  I did.  And then that didn't get to me.  So then he started hinting there's a sex tape.  And of course, if, if someone's going to say there's a sex tape starring someone that  you love, you know, it's going to, obviously it's going to like, uh, get to you a little  bit.  Yeah.  But, but I knew the source.  I'm like, this is ridiculous, ridiculous.  And that was a year and a half ago.  And I thought we were finally done with it, but somehow this ass got together with another 
[00:58:30]  disgruntled employee, uh, and then got, uh, Chauncey Hayden involved who hates our guts  because we don't acknowledge him as, as a journalist or anything.  I, he's just, he's just another one of these losers with, with, with, uh, serious issues  deep down in his soul.  They all got together and, and came up with a fine cocktail today and they got page, uh,  page six in the post to actually print this nonsense.  Yeah.  And, and, and page six, we know hate, you know, they hate us.  They hate us.  Because, uh, Richard Johnson is, uh, you know, it's, it's no secret. 
[00:59:00]  He's, uh, but he likes Howard a lot and we, you know, what's going on between the two  shows there problems over the years.  So he doesn't like us.  So now, uh, a year and a half after, uh, this person has claimed this, this quote, sex tape,  it's now in print in a paper.  I know it's not true.  These guys know it's not true, but now I have to effing deal with this.  Yeah.  Well, deal with it.  Uh, deal with it right.  So the haters are, are having a lot of fun today, but you know what? 
[00:59:30]  Be careful with what you, with what you say, be careful with what you print because you're  going to be, uh, you're going to be very disappointed in the end.  Chauncey had the opportunity to call you up, get your, uh, statement on the whole thing,  but that would have blown it up.  It would have not made an interesting story because you'd have said, no, there isn't.  Uh, I'll, I'll, you know, you show me, show me one, one frame from, uh, a sex tape.  Yeah.  And then, uh, it would have ruined the story. 
[01:00:00]  So of course, why get in touch with you?  And I, and my statement, I, I, I made it at six, but I'll say it again.  It is very easy.  Very easy.  I have a hundred thousand dollars in cash and cash to the unmarked bills to the first  person that brings me and hear, hear me out.  Cause they'll, they'll misprint this crap.  Yeah.  A copy of the sex tape.  That means you could keep the original and all the other copies quote you might have.  Sell it to people, put it on websites, do whatever you want.  Do whatever you want. 
[01:00:30]  Bring me a lousy copy.  That doesn't mean I'm trying to buy the tape and I will hand over a hundred thousand.  Yep.  Because it doesn't exist.  Guess what?  No one is collecting the hundred thousand.  Trust me on this.  And this person has no idea what he started, man.  Oh, he has no effing idea.  Oh, he's a severely damaged person.  And you know, someday you can have your fun with all this and move on to the next thing  that's going to get under my skin or someone else's skin. 
[01:01:00]  But guess what?  Eventually you're going to have to deal with your demons eventually and stop blaming everyone  else.  Everyone else for your failures.  Blame everyone else because, because you couldn't hold the job.  Oh, Ope is willing to spend money on this one and he still has his communion money.  Yeah, basically.  Yeah, exactly.  Everyone knows that.  If you offered money for this Zapruder film, I would believe it was a phone. 
[01:01:30]  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Ridiculous.  Yeah, but you got to deal with it now.  And it's, you know, and, and, and this, this is the type of guy I said this earlier too.  This is the type of guy that if he did have a tape like this, he would not physically or  mentally be able to hold onto it and keep it under wraps for that long.  He'd have at least to, to get to Opie emailed him stills from it or something, just some 
[01:02:00]  evidence that, Hey, look what I got, but it doesn't exist.  So it's another, uh, wild concoction in this guy's head, uh, one of the many wild concoctions.  And then the, the printing in the paper, these lies that Opie's been, um, behind the scenes  trying to, uh, uh, stop distribution.  You can look that up.  Of this.  Where did, when did that happen?  Wouldn't a lawyer be involved with that? 
[01:02:30]  Isn't that public file?  So why doesn't the media go do a little research, do some research, you see suckers, see if you  filed any kind of, uh, C and D or filed, uh, what do they call that when you try to keep  something from getting out?  You're not even going to, uh, injunction.  I'll slap an injunction on him.  You're not even going to find that as far as, uh, me dealing with this disgruntled employee.  No.  To shut him up.  No.  It was just very obvious that, you know, he knew, he knew that he was being stupid. 
[01:03:00]  Did he?  And that, well.  A moment of clarity?  Well, at the time, cause it, you know, he finally realized and stopped his nonsense.  But for some reason now, a year and a half later, it's, this, uh, rears its ugly head  again.  Ugh.  So, uh, it says, Opie, fiance, and sex video, uh, the sex man, Opie, and Anthony radio show  is facing its own carnal comeuppance.  Greg Opie Hughes is said to be livid over an X-rated romp starring his stunning, uh, stunning  blonde fiance. 
[01:03:30]  Say, no, I'm livid because this is being printed.  I was, I was nowhere near livid before today.  And the reason I'm livid is because now there's printing a complete lies in the paper and I  don't give a crap.  I swear, man, I don't care.  For the most part, I don't care what people say about me and you can print whatever you  want in the paper.  They, they printed horrific things when we did our sex for Sam thing and all the other  radio things we did over the years.  But my chick doesn't want to be involved with any of this crap.  That's why I kept a low profile.  That's why I do care. 
[01:04:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  Uh, let's see.  It's said to be livid over an X-rated romp starring his stunning blonde fiance known by her  first name.  Uh, and, and, and by the way, the, the sex tape isn't me and her.  It's, it's according to the paper, it's her and someone she's never met in her life.  Bam.  Yeah.  Bam Margera.  A disgruntled ex-employee of the radio duo recently acquired rights to the video.  It's just an all out lie. 
[01:04:30]  And I'll say it again.  One copy.  Not even the, not even the, not even the original one copy.  You can, you can make a thousand copies.  Give me one of them to prove this is true.  And I will hand over $100,000.  Once you put your money where your mouth is.  Rather have a drink there.  Oh, and here it is.  And, and this is, this is, and here's, here's some bullet points here. 
[01:05:00]  Okay.  Uh, for the media, uh, you know, uh, once you started looking into, you know, what, I don't  even know how you do it, public files or whatever to see what kind of lawsuits and injunctions  are being.  Yeah.  Okay.  Do that.  Because, uh, the next line is really interested, uh, uh, interesting.  A disgruntled, uh, all right.  Required, uh, the, the rights of the video from Bam himself.  Bam himself turned.  Listen to this craziness.  Yeah.  Bam himself turned over a sex tape to a disgruntled loser employee of ours, ex-employee of ours. 
[01:05:30]  Right.  On what effing planet?  On what effing planet?  Yeah.  Why would he do that?  On what effing planet did that happen?  Uh, and it's soon to be released on a pay for play website.  Go for it.  Really?  Go for it.  Really?  Soon to be.  Oh, uh, and Chauncey, uh, is the one that wrote this.  So, Chauncey, when did, how soon?  How soon?  And what's the site?  Wouldn't you have plugged it in there?  In there?  Soon to be on.  How soon, P-boy? 
[01:06:00]  How soon, P-boy?  You, you, you're not too brave now.  And how much can you make on a pay for play website?  People would do it once and copy it.  Yeah.  You'd make $1.80.  It's just idiotic on every level.  This is, uh, reports stepping out to Chauncey Hayden.  And then, uh, this is in this, uh, lovely article.  They're doing the nasty, and I mean nasty, Hayden says.  So, Chauncey, are you saying you saw this tape?  Yeah, Chauncey then must have seen it.  You do realize what you're saying by saying, by having that in print, right?  You do realize that.  Mm-hmm.  You do realize that. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  And what's very interesting, you've never met my girl, and there's, you know,  there's, there's no way you would know what she looks like.  So, you standing by that statement, Chauncey, I ask you that today.  I ask you that today.  And then it says, uh, Hughes is taking legal action to prevent its distribution.  Really, that's something you can look up.  This is something that started a year and a half ago.  Go back and check it out.  Check it out.  A year and a half, all the way up to today.  You're not going to find nothing. 
[01:07:00]  Uh, let's see.  Uh.  Distraught.  Uh.  Apparently, he's so distraught that he's banned the name Bam from being mentioned on the show.  Really?  Holy S.  Did I do that, Jimmy?  No.  Exactly.  Hope not.  I like to say it.  It's a fun word.  Yeah, exactly.  Steve from Bayshore. 
[01:07:30]  What?  By nasty, uh, Chauncey means it was a guy and girl having sex.  He only likes videos featuring gentlemen of mutual affection.  Yeah, maybe that was what he meant by nasty.  Um, people are confused because of our old bid, a hundred grand.  No, I'm talking a hundred thousand dollars in cash.  Yeah.  Dollars.  And then you get, you got some haters writing this and feedback.  How you're reacting?  It seems like it might be true.  No, I'm reacting because this crap gets to be printed without anyone, you know, doing, 
[01:08:00]  uh, just, uh, a little bit of research.  Yeah.  A little bit of, uh, of, uh, uh, snooping around.  I don't think you're reacting like it's true.  Well, but that's what the haters do, you know.  Ralph.  Is that why we weren't, uh, because we wanted to have Emeril Lagasse on, uh, but Opie said  no.  Emeril Lagasse.  Think about it.  Think about it.  I, I, I got it.  Thank you.  Hope you don't ban the word boo.  Boo.  Boo. 
[01:08:30]  Boo.  Oh, damn it.  I don't get the Emeril Lagasse.  Oh, that's what he says when he spices something up.  He goes, bam.  Let's, uh, how do you know that?  I think he used to be popular for 10 minutes.  Why don't we, uh, why don't we get Bam on the phone?  Yeah, there you go.  Let's get Bam on the phone.  There's an idea.  I'm not, I'm not hiding you idiot on this feedback who thought I'm reacting in a weird  way.  Let's get Bam on the phone.  That's a good idea.  Let's get Richard Johnson from page six on the phone.  Let's see if he's prepared to Dick Johnson. 
[01:09:00]  Let's see if he's prepared to stand behind these, uh, these, these false allegations.  Let's get Chauncey on the phone and see if he's brave enough to stand behind this.  Yeah.  Where is he?  They're all hiding.  You were completely available to any of these people, uh, in the, the media for a comment.  And what did they say?  Oh, uh, a Greg Hughes was unavailable for comment.  Really? 
[01:09:30]  His rep.  Were you?  Yeah.  His rep.  What?  Bob?  It's the only rep we have.  Bob didn't get a call.  Cause he, when the second he gets a call, he calls us.  It's a thing they do in the media.  They could say that and there's no way of proving they actually made the phone call or  reached out.  Yeah.  It's a, it's a very, they do it all the time.  I love when Bob calls me late at night.  It's like Ambien.  It's kind of not right.  How do we get Bam on the phone? 
[01:10:00]  How do you do that?  You got Bam's number?  Oh, no.  All right.  Well, we'll, we'll try to get him on the phone as well.  All right.  So, so effing frustrating.  I'll tell you this, what we, what we did for this guy, cause it's just, what we did for  this guy over the years, what we did for him.  He'll never know.  Cause he was never told really.  Um, he was told things like, look, you better, you know, you better step up. 
[01:10:30]  You better watch yourself.  The, the, the brass is looking, uh, things like that.  But he wasn't told how many times, uh, it was, we were asked, look, we want to get rid  of this guy.  And we sat there and said, no, you know, Opie personally said, uh, to, uh, Elo, look, give  the kid another shot, give him a break, give him a break.  You know, maybe he's got some issues. 
[01:11:00]  Well, I know, I know a bunch of, uh, issues he's dealing with, which are real issues that  I, I know for a fact.  Yeah.  Okay.  But he's got some serious demons and, uh, you know, he can continue down this road and  he'll go down other roads.  He'll, he'll, he'll move on from this and come up with something else.  I guarantee it.  He was, but eventually he's going to have to deal with the demons that are, are making  him, uh, do this.  I got a phone call from Elo one day and his father is, is, is a very powerful guy and he's  not going to be happy when he gets the phone call today because he, you know, this could 
[01:11:30]  affect him too.  I got a call from Elo once and, uh, he said, look, uh, he's gone.  We're, we're just, we're, we're firing him.  And, uh, I was talking and going, you know, ah, come on, give the guy another shot.  We'll have a talk with him or something.  And Elo actually said, okay, look, uh, I'll let you guys handle it.  It's your show.  You guys know what's best.  And then after a while, like I said before, it got to the point where the, it went so far 
[01:12:00]  upstairs that it was out of our hands.  They just said, no, look, it's been too many times.  Uh, this is the final straw.  He's gone.  We got to fire him.  And even then we were like, you know, ah, come on.  And they said, no, dude.  And then he got the boot and what did he do?  He turned around and just started bashing.  No, it's sad too.  We have him on record lying.  So this is, you know, if that doesn't, ah, whatever. 
[01:12:30]  It's really just frustrating that I got to deal with it.  But we have, because there was a big incident that happened that was really serious and  everyone had to give statements, everybody, everybody.  And he gave a statement to lawyers, actual lawyers.  There was a possible case involved with this where I got, we got to beat around the bush  a little bit here.  And then a video surfaced that, that, that proved that he was lying in a statement that  we still have.  And he almost took the whole effing showdown with that lie. 
[01:13:00]  And that is when Eric said, we can't have him around.  The liability.  We can't have him around.  He's going to take you guys all out with this crap.  And even then I was, I was, I was bummed.  I'm not even going to lie to you.  I was bummed.  I'm like, come on, man.  You know, he's, he's, he really needs, uh, he really needs help.  Maybe we could, maybe we could do some other things and, you know, get him some, some of  this help.  And then maybe he comes back on the show.  I don't know.  And what do you get?  And he goes, no, this time around, it's out of your hands. 
[01:13:30]  This has to be done.  He lied to a lawyer.  So.  Oh, Chauncey, you are just a scum.  Yeah.  He's a.  You are a scum.  He's just got a paper blog.  It's a paper blog.  And trust me, I'm fully aware that you're frustrated that we don't, you know, acknowledge  you and give you the respect that you desperately, you desperately want from Howard. 
[01:14:00]  That's what he hates.  And everybody else.  And you want respect from fellow journalists, but you know what you are.  You're just a scum.  We sat at a table with him when he interviewed us for Penthouse and he did nothing but rip  Howard apart talking about his hair and personal stuff and just ripping him apart and saying,  oh, my God, you guys are great.  And then I guess we didn't give him enough respect. 
[01:14:30]  The last time I saw him, which was years ago, he came running up.  It was that privilege.  It was some kind of something going on it.  You know, they were somebody.  We had a book that came out or something.  I don't know exactly.  And he came running up to me to shake my hand, all excited that I was there.  And I just turned my back on the guy.  Yeah.  I don't want anything to do with him.  Now he's got a vendetta.  Because this is the type of guy he is.  I don't shake hands of phonies ever.  Douche.  Ever. 
[01:15:00]  Ass.  It's the Opie and Anthony program.  Hi.  How are you?  Being joined right now.  Hi.  Of course, Jimmy Norton.  Hi.  Per usual.  I think Opie's in the can.  He's dropping a nagel.  Oh.  Sorry.  Oh, boy, does he not like that.  Not even a hint of a smile when you refer to feces as a nagel.  He does not like it. 
[01:15:30]  Who thought that up, guys?  Was that Sam?  It was.  I knew it was Sam.  Sam is very cherubish.  Very adorable.  Yeah.  But he is one of the biggest a-holes on the entire program.  He's just a nasty, you're a nasty kid.  He was a nice kid.  You guys made him go intern with Scorch.  What do you expect?  Yeah, that might have done it.  Colin Quinn joining us here also.  Welcome, Colin.  Hi, guys.  Always good to have you on board. 
[01:16:00]  Colin!  Like it's a ship.  I've been listening to you.  On board.  I've been listening to the show.  It's great to be here on Aces Up with Lefty Rosenthal.  You know, it's a shame if the county commissioner wants to come on and debate me.  I just dropped an ex-employee.  Some people can do something and get away with it and others can't.  It's hypocrisy.  Such is life.  Right.  My first guest is Frankie Avalon.  Colin, you're going to be at what?  Caroline's.  I'm going to be at Caroline's Comedy Hour on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 
[01:16:30]  No Thursday show.  No, what?  You had a Thursday show?  No, I wanted to know why you did.  I'm sure people did.  Did you have one?  Come on.  Yes, Jimmy did.  I didn't have one.  That's what he was getting at.  Of course.  Oh, he was doing it to me.  No, I was actually probably implying that when you only do the weekend, that's more a sign  of being famous than when you do the full week.  The celebrities come in and just do Friday, Saturday.  They don't do Thursday through Sunday.  Oh, is that how it works?  I like how you just spoke.  No, it's true.  I like that he said that.  But the truth of the matter is, in some clubs, that's true on the road. 
[01:17:00]  But in Caroline's, I think it's a sign of a decline and fall of a great man.  You know, the county commissioner wants to come on and debate any time I'm here.  The county commissioner.  And just now, I was waiting for you guys.  For some reason, out of nowhere, there was a commercial for the movie.  The movie of a Bronx Tale.  And all I could think of was Beans.  Beans?  Louis Beans.  You know what we ought to do?  We ought to get the real audio from the movie of Beans. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, God.  And compare it.  Oh, we haven't.  Why don't we do that?  Definitely.  And then have Chaz come in and go, and are you, is he dodging you?  He's dodging me.  He's only 20 bucks and he's dodging me.  You know, Louis Beans.  You're right.  You're always right.  He could be reading off a menu.  Oh, he's horrible.  I watched it on YouTube and it was really great.  Yeah.  It's so bad.  Oh, that's right.  There's a video of that, right?  Yeah.  We videotaped that.  We videotaped everything.  It was on YouTube.  All right.  We'll have to check that out. 
[01:18:00]  And I saw this guy, this up-and-comer named Big A.  You want to hear what I look like?  This up-and-comer.  A young up-and-comer.  Well, do the big setup there, Anthony, for this.  We'll play it again.  It's called The Bronkish Tale.  A Bronkish Tale.  Well, look at that.  What a coincidence on CW11, Chaz Palminteri walking on.  Hey.  Hey, Chaz.  Well, we had Chaz Palminteri coming in.  So we wanted to do something a little different with him from the first time. 
[01:18:30]  So we figured we would set Rich Voss up.  We told him we had a script, because he's always talking about his acting, Rich Voss.  We had a script that we wanted him to read with Jim Norton from A Bronk's Tale.  And just show off his acting prowess.  At the last minute, we informed him, no, it's not going to be with Jim Norton.  It's going to be with Chaz Palminteri, the guy that wrote the movie, wrote the story,  acted in the movie.  And he was so flustered. 
[01:19:00]  Well, he was nervous.  Let me explain one thing, though, Anthony.  Yes.  That was the exact opposite of the way the story went down.  You were on the show.  I watched it on YouTube.  He didn't inform him.  He stood there, and Chaz came out next to him.  Yeah.  That was how he was informed.  Well, that's how he was informed.  Yeah.  Chaz walked out.  And he was so informed by his actions.  Well, I forgot.  Yes.  How about last time I was on, and he was doing Bobby Dice as Bobby Kelly?  It's one of the funniest things in the history of the world. 
[01:19:30]  Dude.  I broke my knee, dude.  Ouch.  So I'm playing Call of Duty 4 with Dane.  Me and Dane.  Dude.  Dude.  Hey, Jimmy, feed snot to my dogs. 
[01:20:00]  Andrew Dice Kelly.  So let's play this bronchish tale.  Yeah.  So we acted with him.  And this is what we got.  This is what we got.  Why haven't we gotten the original scene yet?  We should get the scene.  Get that for tomorrow, Steve.  We can't get the property rights.  You're right.  The original scenes, we could compare.  Oh, God.  That would be a great comparison.  Absolutely.  Here we go.  A bronchish tale.  Robert De Niro. 
[01:20:30]  It's not what you say.  It's what he sees.  In his directorial debut.  We can't accept that.  Starring Chaz Palminteri.  I didn't give it to you.  I gave it to your son.  And Rich Voss.  Louie, things.  I want my money.  A bronch.  You can't dodge me forever.  Come on.  What are you doing about it?  What are you doing about it?  John, I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie Beans.  This guy owes me 20.  And it's been two weeks now.  And every time he sees me, he keeps dodging me, John.  Should I crack him one or what?  The struggle of an idiotic Jewish comedian stammering his way through a few lines of film dialogue 
[01:21:00]  with a genuine Hollywood actor.  Listen, see, sometimes violence is not the answer.  Is he a good friend of yours or not?  Nah, John.  I don't even like him.  Well, there's your answer right there.  Look at him this way.  It costs you $20 to get rid of him.  He's never going to ask you for money again.  He's never going to bother you again.  He's out of your life for $20.  Come on.  You got him cheap.  You're right, John.  You're always right.  A bronch.  Tell.  How do you know the right answer all the time, Johnny? 
[01:21:30]  Well, I try to keep my eyes and ears open all the time.  And I read.  You read?  Yeah, I read.  Come on.  Come on.  Let's go to Mario's next door and get something.  The only line that sounded real is when voice shockingly goes, you read.  What's that?  And if it was real life, he would have said, how do you do that?  Louis Baines.  It reminds me of his act of the daughters.  The original script was Johnny and they used to change it to Sonny.  Yeah.  His first line in that bit there is classic. 
[01:22:00]  Can't you guys bring him in for a lot of actors for movies?  I believe it.  Well, now it's got to be the new bit.  We got to set up the sequel.  The sequel.  Yeah, the sequel.  Yeah.  Because he was nervous when he thought it was me and him doing the scene.  He was in the bathroom.  He really wanted to show us chops.  He really is.  He's horrible.  We had a lot of the boys in that day.  He was going to show off for all of us.  Yeah.  And then Chaz walks in.  Because any time we know this when we're doing the show on Tough Crap, any time we  do a little scene, even his daughters and him did a scene once, he goes into a shame 
[01:22:30]  spiral and just starts like, his face turns red and he just starts going, ah, and starts  like, oh.  No confidence.  None.  And he shouldn't have any.  All his self-esteem just comes out.  I have a movie I did with him.  It was a bad film and we had footage of Voss doing cutaways when he was looking shocked  to the camera.  I've never seen, I've never seen like worse acting even in real life in a movie, in a  play.  Just anyone acting out anything can't be as bad as him. 
[01:23:00]  He's still gunning for Keith over that incident that you guys is a pilot.  Oh, really?  A pilot we haven't heard about since we did it?  Oh, Jesus.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  What does that mean, guys?  I think from what I heard from that scene in particular, it was the only part of the  pilot I heard where he blindfolded two 90-year-old men and made them kick each other.  I think they're sending it over to A&E.  Yeah, I know.  That pilot, the soonest see Amelia Earhart.  We teased the... 
[01:23:30]  Pilot jokes, nothing.  I like it.  We teased a home invasion story, Anthony.  Yes.  And I'm glad Colin's in today.  You know how petrified I am of the home invasion.  But maybe he could talk some sense into you.  I don't need sense to talk to him.  Last time I was in, I remember he was saying he walks around with a gun on his waist.  He's bought two more guns since then.  He's got four handguns.  I like guns.  Four handguns now.  I like guns.  He already has his eye on a fifth, I hear.  I might pick up a Desert Eagle.  Just for fun.  Yeah.  Huh?  Desert Eagles.  Just for fun.  Yeah.  Well, if you have...  Go ahead. 
[01:24:00]  So what happened?  Yeah.  Well, that's what happened with him.  I mean...  I walk around...  Yeah.  And people laugh at me.  They go, well, what do you need to walk around?  Well, the problem is...  I know.  But the problem is you're like falling into that category of any guy from your neck of  the woods, as we know my cousins are from out there, that gets a few dollars, immediately  they go into, you know, that crisis, you know, instead of having like an existential crisis  where they like try to go to threat, you just buy more guns and somehow project outward 
[01:24:30]  the inner pain.  You know what I'm saying?  I'm not Dr. Phil about it.  It can't just be that I enjoy shooting different types of guns.  I go to the range.  Yes.  I love guns.  I'm talking about walking around fully strapped in your house.  It's not fully strapped.  I'm not wearing a bandolier full of like a bandito.  But you told me you never walk around even in your underwear.  You said you wear BVDs with a footwear.  Well, I don't think I've ever talked about walking around in underwear.  I like...  It's comfortable.  It almost...  You have your wallet in your back pocket, right?  Right.  Well, this feels like another just accessory that you have that you carry with you. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, but I'm just saying even in your house, you can probably get a lot of alarms and stuff,  right?  But your house is...  That's where the home invasions happen.  I understand, but you have a little pre-alarm system.  I have an alarm system, but let's be honest.  I totally agree with carrying the gun, having the gun handy.  The gun being around...  I've read stories of home invasions where then the guy couldn't get to his gun.  Well, even the BTK killer.  I know what you're talking about.  Yeah, the woman cocked the gun and... 
[01:25:30]  No, that was the Richard...  Oh, that was...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, was that horrid.  The guy was a boxer.  And this guy kicked in his door, and the family...  But he thought it was like a setup.  And that was the beginning of BTK killer.  He thought they were joking.  They were the family in the middle of the year.  Yeah, it's a joke.  Yeah.  Yeah, oops.  So you're right to have the guns handy, but I'm just saying having them on you is probably  more handy if you could just be like, oh my God.  No, how about just have one on you, and it's, like I said, like your wallet.  You just have it on you.  All right, I agree.  It's nice. 
[01:26:00]  It's a small little thing.  Fits right there under your shirt.  Talking about Sig Sauer, maybe a 3A.  I got the Sig 45.  Nice.  Well...  It's wonderful.  An HK 40, and just picked up a Walther 9mm.  Do you know, not one person I'm told that to has said, that's a good idea.  Not one person has said...  But I do understand.  Not one good for you or good for him.  Good for you.  Not one good for him.  Well, you know what we say, better to be judged by 12 than carried by 16. 
[01:26:30]  Anyway, so when the home invasion stories come up, I try to help Anthony out a little  bit.  Yeah.  Because a lot of people think he's a bit paranoid, but then you got these stories in  the news every day, but this home invader, I don't think you could do anything about.  No?  No, I think this one would get you.  Oh, boy.  Here's the story.  And in Florida, a woman finds a surprise in her kitchen.  An 8-foot-long alligator.  Oh!  An alligator?  Yeah.  Wow, that would suck. 
[01:27:00]  Alligators are doing home invasions now in Florida.  That's what they're doing?  Yeah.  How would you defend against that?  Well, I probably wouldn't shoot him.  Well, because you hear, I think what would happen, you would hear a noise, someone obviously  broke into your house, and you're looking around for this...  Oh, you're looking at, like, eye level.  Yeah, you're looking at eye level, and all of a sudden the croc takes your leg off.  Bites your foot off.  Takes your foot.  Oh, wow.  How do you defend against that?  And then you got the pain, and now you can't really focus with the gun.  That's tough.  You're in deep trouble.  You know what, though?  Well, he'd have to come up my stairs. 
[01:27:30]  See, my game plan is to be upstairs, high ground.  But you're not really fully committed to it, because if you're really fully committed  to it, what you would do is have, like, one time I saw this movie...  Scunners?  ...that had a bunch of different mirrors, and every time the guy shot, he thought it was  you, but it was really the mirror.  Oh!  So I need to put mirrors on every wall.  No, put, like, fake entrances, and then when the guy comes in, you shoot him, you know?  I like the idea, believe me.  I have a game plan.  You know, I have a game plan in the house.  Yeah?  Look, all jokes aside, I agree with you.  I think that all people should be murdered. 
[01:28:00]  And what bothers me about the anti-gun people is they never mention, and this is a big part  of it, how many people don't get killed and don't get raped because they had a gun and  shot them by.  Well, when you're a card-carrying member of the National Rifle Association, like I am,  you get a magazine every month...  And they give you the stats?  ...and they have stories.  Yeah.  They have stories of armed citizens and how they avoided getting killed during the Commission  of Crimes using their guns in their homes because, you know, the news never prints that. 
[01:28:30]  But, Opie's got a good point.  Why can't they give you the stats which would help them?  No, they just have crazy stories out of detective magazines.  Right, right.  I was almost killed and buried alive until I used my Walter P. gator.  It was great, it was...  But the stats would help in the long run.  It really would.  Let's get the rest of the story on.  Foot-long alligator.  Deputies say 69-year-old Sandra Frosty called 911 after finding the 200-pound reptile.  A trapper came to remove the gator and the animal was cut when a plate fell to the ground 
[01:29:00]  during the chaos.  No one else was hurt.  Deputies say that gator pushed through a screen door before making its way through the living  room, down the hall, and he pretended he was selling encyclopedias and the woman opened  the door and he stuck him.  Yeah, I guess so.  And he bit her ankles.  Encyclopedias?  I'll tell you, he'd make a...  That's the one part of that joke you found a fault with?  Thanks.  My pronunciation.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  What about Joseph Callinger?  Remember him in the 60s? 
[01:29:30]  He used to work around with his son and he'd go door to door and he'd be fixing things and  I mean, his son, he'd kill people and he'd cut off one of his son's penis and put it  in a jar and they'd rape and kill people.  It was in suburban Philly.  Wow.  The shoemaker.  The shoemaker.  The shoemaker.  I never heard of him.  Him and his son together?  Joe Callinger.  Yeah.  And the other son, he didn't like.  He fell into disfavor.  He cut his penis and put it in a jar.  Huh.  Did they ever make up after that?  Joe Callinger.  Yeah, right?  Dad, come here.  Look, I owe you an apology.  You'll never go for one. 
[01:30:00]  You'll know exactly what it's for.  Hey, switch of gears slightly here.  Well, more than slightly.  We have a priest that went bye-bye.  He disappeared.  Yeah, this is such an odd little story.  Have you heard this one yet?  No.  Oh my God, listen to this.  This is Reverend Adelier Antonio DeCarli just moments before he set out on an ambitious  journey to fly 465 miles using small, helium-filled party balloons.  The Brazilian priest was looking to break the record for most hours flying balloons. 
[01:30:30]  He was hoping to raise money for a spiritual rest stop for truckers.  Now, more than a day later, rescue workers are...  A spiritual rest stop for truckers?  A spiritual rest stop for truckers?  That story has so many things in it.  You know, wait, wait, what?  Yeah.  Where do you understand?  It's a glory hole where you can also receive communion.  You're back, Jimmy.  You're back.  Oh, God.  Chicago's going to love you this weekend.  Oh, God.  That's a great line.  That's a great line.  Cool rest stop for truckers.  Now, more than a day later, rescue workers are trying to figure out where he is. 
[01:31:00]  Port authorities say the last time they heard from him, he was calling to get help using  a GPS device that was tracking his coordinates.  Fire department officials say they're focusing their search on the southern coast of Brazil.  Winds apparently had pushed DeCarli about 31 miles off the coast when he last made contact.  Pieces of his balloons were also found here.  The tariff treasurer says she's confident the priest will be found alive.  In addition to being an experienced skydiver, she says he also had a floatable seat and 
[01:31:30]  a parachute with him.  What?  Inspector Gadget.  These guys go like 18 to 20,000 feet in a chair lifted by balloons.  I've seen those videos.  Those are insane.  Years ago, the guy got down because when he wanted to go down, he had a BB gun.  He just started shooting balloons until they took him down.  That's crazy.  The priest kind of disappeared.  Is that what he was in?  I thought he was in a regular hot air balloon.  I think he was in a regular hot air balloon, but he had these other gadgets.  It looks like he had a shoe to do a little skydiving. 
[01:32:00]  What do you know, Danny?  It was not a regular balloon.  Much of it, right?  Yeah, he was using that stereotypical kid floating away on a bunch of carnival balloons.  Oh, like a lawn chair?  Yeah, it looked like something out of Mythbusters.  It was no basket.  It was just pretty much exactly what you said, like a chair with a harness on it.  Oh, my God.  And that's all he was using.  He's so dead.  I don't know about that.  He's a skydiver, so he might have jumped out.  Just the fact that we're discussing this is asinine, but also, don't you think the minute  they go to some other country besides America, you're always like, oh, we don't know how to do stuff there. 
[01:32:30]  It's retarded.  We've got to go back to guns for a second.  We've got Ray from Westchester, a lovely lady.  Ray, what's up?  Hi, I was just wondering if Anthony's going to get an underwater assault rifle to keep  in his pool.  Yeah, yeah.  How much do you love her, by the way?  That's a tough one.  I've still got to figure out what I'm going to do when the pool goes in.  She just told you what to do.  Underwater assault rifle, like the SEAL teams use?  Yes.  Or at least a harpoon, like a harpoon gun. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, oh, like a spear gun.  Yes.  Excuse me.  Okay.  Good.  These are all good suggestions.  That makes cleanup a lot easier, because you can pull the person out of your pool.  That's true.  Not to profile, but you don't need to protect yourself in your pool.  Oh, okay.  That's true.  Two places to save, the pool and the library.  Not known for swimming prowess.  Oh, my God.  We have to take a break.  All righty. 
[01:33:30]  Playing Caroline's starting Friday?  Friday, Saturday, Sunday?  My skit is on Friday.  Yeah, I guess I'm not on Thursday.  Like, this phony over here.  Two on two, 757-4100.  I'm guessing you're doing two Friday, two Saturday, and one Saturday.  I like that jaded, but I'm still a pro and going to give the number.  Shut up.  I have to.  I want people to come see you.  I also.  They didn't run you a good morning America, you phony.  I know they didn't.  They never ran it.  I heard they were getting B-roll for the piece.  I know, but I was already there, so why would I do that?  Yeah, he was promoting Caroline's.  I think I saw it for last week. 
[01:34:00]  Oh.  What is Steve talking?  Somebody said yesterday they were looking for B-roll.  They need B-roll.  I don't know why they did.  I guess they didn't like the piece.  Well, maybe they're looking forward to your next performance there.  I'll tell you something, because Caroline's, what a great place.  And they treat us so well over there.  I want to thank them.  And the food is really good.  Yeah, it is.  It was great.  You got Greg Charles to thank.  Yeah.  He's in the office.  He looks like a young guy, McDowell, with his hat and his hair and the shape of his nose.  He looks like Malcolm McDowell, clockwork orange face, except he has facial hair. 
[01:34:30]  Really?  Yep, that's who Greg looks like.  I have a feeling he's a raging alcoholic, too.  You think so?  Why?  What do we know on that?  I don't know.  Every time I see him.  What do we know on that?  Give me some info.  Right.  I need some intel.  Well, he's just high with lefties.  That's unbelievable.  Such is life.  What's wrong with Colin?  Hey, when we get back, maybe your take on the whole Hillary thing?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Oh, I'd love to.  Why not?  And we got audio, because you were coming in today.  We have to take care of Colin. 
[01:35:00]  We have brand new Scorch audio for you.  It's always, you know.  You want to know what we got?  The only thing I'm worried about is you guys being upstated by some of his topicals.  Well, this is what we got for the people out there.  Scorch's top names for Food Network shows.  I feel we did that last time.  It's all the same thing.  But we didn't.  Check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Colin Quinn in studio today playing Carolines here in New York City.  212-757-4100. 
[01:35:30]  There's a lot going on today.  There was something else I did want to talk about before we get into the Scorch audio.  And also, we got the original scene from A Bronx Tale.  Oh.  We got the original scene from A Bronx Tale.  I finally took care of my picking problem.  I don't think I brought this up in the air that much.  But the guys around here, completely fed up.  As a matter of fact, two days ago, Anthony walked in just before the show started when  we were jamming to Rush.  And he was in a bad mood? 
[01:36:00]  Even though he says he wasn't?  It was for two seconds.  Yeah.  Hold on a minute.  And Opie has a thing on his right hand.  Kind of like on the fatty area between the thumb and pointer finger.  Forefinger.  That looks...  It was something that was a cut that became a scar.  Oh.  I just want to thank Keith the Cop.  You're real friends coming out of the woodwork in the time of need.  Oh.  What were you saying?  I was just reading a text.  I was just explaining where your little cut was that you started to pick at.  Right.  On your hand.  Well, I'll tell you when it started. 
[01:36:30]  I banged my hand getting up for the show.  You know the deal, Ant, Jim.  I bang my hand quite often.  Actually, I'm not...  That little moment of silence had me a little flustered.  That's a close call.  I knocked over a fan this morning getting ready for the show.  Because you're just walking around in the dark, confused like a zombie.  Yeah, right.  Just standing there. 
[01:37:00]  You're accessible.  So, what was the movie that came out with...  This helps the story.  This is where it'll get people to open their mouths wide and look at the radio.  Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn, that dumb comedy.  What was it called?  The Breakup.  I'm not gay if I watch this.  Well, then, guilty as charged.  All right.  Me and my girl went, saw the movie.  Whatever.  It was okay.  It killed a couple hours.  It was no big deal.  Yeah.  We went and had sushi and I had a little scab.  Sushi. 
[01:37:30]  I remember the day this began.  I had a little scab and I went, pick.  And just picked it off my hand.  Mm-hmm.  How long ago did that movie come out?  Because I've been picking ever since.  This same area.  Should have been done right there.  One pick.  Right.  End of story.  So, it got to the point where Anthony walks in two days and goes and he goes, will you  just...  What did you say exactly?  Is it stop picking that?  He just finally had it.  Like other things that we didn't bring to their attention out there in radio land.  Kenny would bring me Band-Aids every day.  I would try everything. 
[01:38:00]  He would give me a Band-Aid to cover up the area.  You'd scratch through the Band-Aid.  I would scratch through the Band-Aid and get back at it.  I tried putting like glue and stuff around it so I would at least pick the glue before  I get back to the scab.  It was just a complete nightmare.  My family is known for being pickers.  We all will pick.  Yeah.  But I thought I was all right with that except for this dumb thing on my hand, right?  So, I went to the skin doctor yesterday to get...  How's the sore doing in your nose?  Oh, man.  Look, man.  I'm having a bad morning, man.  Just trying to bring a little levity to the day. 
[01:38:30]  We could talk about my nose picking on another day.  I'll throw myself under the bus for that one.  No problem.  I didn't even realize you guys knew on that one.  We all have our crosses to bear.  It's a dry nose.  But anyway, because now people are going to...  Nah, whatever.  It's been many years.  So, I went to the skin doctor to get my skin check to do it every year because my mom  had skin cancer, blah, blah, blah.  And stupid Tom Chiusano got us all paranoid with skin cancer.  But God bless him because now I'm taking it seriously, right?  That's good, yeah. 
[01:39:00]  So, I went to the skin doctor for my regular checkup yesterday and I finally said, look,  I'm picking my hand for well over a year, year and a half at this point.  And she looks at it.  She goes, well, you haven't really done any damage.  It's completely healed.  What's going on is there's a lot of scar tissue, which is a lot thicker, and you're just  digging away at that scar tissue over and over again.  She goes, I'll solve that.  I'm like, really?  She goes, yeah.  She hands me a stress ball and she goes, hold on.  She pulls out a needle.  Pulls out a needle.  So, it's going to be a meat cleaver and cut your hand off.  I wish. 
[01:39:30]  She brought in a psychologist.  Right.  So, she pulls out a needle and she starts poking it with steroids.  Uh-oh.  I guess that will soften up the tissue so you don't touch it anymore.  But after feeling these needles, especially because I got another one on my pinky that  I've been going at.  Your pinky knuckle.  Pinky knuckle that I've been doing since November.  So, there's two of them, really.  Is that how you tell time? 
[01:40:00]  Is that like your calendar?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, look at that.  Oh, it has been 11 months.  It's a reminder.  Fourth of July.  I got someone's birthday coming up.  You told me that four scars ago.  So, getting a needle right into your pinky knuckle will stop you from touching your hands.  I am here to say that today.  Yeah, that's got to hurt.  She goes, yeah.  And then she goes, yeah.  There's a lot of nerve endings in that area.  I'm like, well, maybe we should have numbed the area before you decide to do this. 
[01:40:30]  So, I haven't picked in about 12.  It's like AA.  Oh, maybe I shouldn't say that.  Why is it?  I haven't picked in 12 hours.  I'm going to, you know, hopefully do the right thing.  It's great that we should get to the root cause.  You're talking, Colin!  You're talking!  Your picking is the equivalent of my guns.  Right.  Oh, we got problems on this show.  I mean, I'll be the first.  They'll have our issues.  It's your fingers, your guns, and my genitals.  Just three dysfunctional nothings. 
[01:41:00]  Our little addictions and problems.  Three chimps.  We got the OCD in my family there, Colin.  Yeah, I have a little bit of that kind of stuff, too.  But I got the easy one.  My mom is suffering bad with the OCD.  Her thing is, like, horrendous without getting into it.  If it means me picking everyone's wild, so be it.  Compared to what she's dealing with, woo-hoo!  Yeah, we got a little bit of that stuff, too.  I think I must have, like, ADHD or something.  I forget what I have, but somebody...  No, I... 
[01:41:30]  You forget.  They say everyone has a little taste of the OCD.  I think you have Alzheimer's.  What's ADHD?  You know, that's not funny.  Because one time I was on a show, and they were making fun of Charlton.  Oh, that was you.  So, anyway, hopefully the picking's over.  Wait, what is ADHD?  I don't know, but I heard I had it for a doctor.  It's like attention deficit disorder with an H thrown in.  I don't know what the H is for.  I think that's right.  That's the H.  I don't like the fact that you were about to confront it.  Like, wait, what is it? 
[01:42:00]  Like, he cares about your well-being.  Shh.  Look it up.  Anyway, and $1,500 later, by the way.  Yeah, but that's also the stress point.  She just...  What she did was killed...  You know, that's a real important stress point.  She just destroyed your nerves in that area.  You can never relax again, really.  It's all right.  I'm just going to make it into a tattoo or something.  And isn't it funny that speaking of his guns and Jim's genitals, it's all that same area  he used to pull a trigger and also...  It could be anything in life that you use that hand for. 
[01:42:30]  That's true.  Here we go.  I don't like the fact that Opie goes, all right, all right.  Why?  I'm trying to have a little metaphorical moment.  Eating.  What the hell's the problem today?  I've got to, like, move on.  We've got a lot of good material here.  Fine.  I mean, we could...  All right.  Fine.  Because we don't really want to know what you think when it comes to our little foibles.  Why?  Because it'll get us all depressed.  We know we've got our issues.  So?  We all do.  I pick. 
[01:43:00]  Anthony buys a gun every other day.  Every other day.  I was actually thinking of picking one up today.  And Jimmy has insomnia, so, you know...  Jimmy has insomnia?  He has a new character that the message board is loving.  What is it called?  They're calling it something like Jim the Insomniac or Insomnia Jimmy Rules.  I hadn't slept in...  I was up for almost 48 hours.  I just couldn't...  I would lay in bed and just stare.  So I would just get up and writing to be productive.  And I finally napped yesterday and slept last night.  But it was two days without...  It was awful.  It sounds like a good character, though. 
[01:43:30]  What does that have to do with the character?  He led you in to tell me about Insomnia Jimmy.  I had to tell you.  I had to set up Insomnia Jimmy.  Because the character, I was just very silly.  I get very silly when I'm overtired.  Ah.  And the reason, Colin, I'm trying to move on is because we got the original scene from...  I'm excited.  I know.  I want to see it.  All right.  I want to hear it.  Do we have to play Vosses again or no?  Well, I would love to hear Vosses again.  It doesn't matter to me.  I can hear that a thousand times.  Can we hear the real one first?  The real one?  Yeah.  Let's hear the real one. 
[01:44:00]  It's slightly different, obviously, but you'll get the point.  Sonny is Johnny.  The script is changed.  And I think the words are a little different in places.  The original clip from A Bronx Tale that Voss redid with Chaz a couple months ago.  Louie!  My grandmother's sick.  I got to get out of here.  I'll talk to you later.  I can't.  I got to go do something.  Where's my f***ing money?  F***ing devil that catch you, you piece of s***.  Hey, come here.  What's the matter? 
[01:44:30]  This guy Louie dumps over here.  You know, he owes me $20.  It's been two weeks now.  And every time he sees me, he keeps dodging me.  Yeah.  He's becoming a real pain in the ass.  I mean, should I crack him on or what?  What's the matter with you?  What about the telling me?  Sometimes hurting somebody ain't the answer.  First of all, is he a good friend of yours?  Nah, I don't even like him.  You don't even like him.  Well, there's your answer right there.  Look at it this way.  It costs you $20 to get rid of him.  Right?  He's never going to bother you again.  He's never going to ask you for money again.  He's out of your life for $20. 
[01:45:00]  You got off cheap.  Forget it.  You're always right.  You're always right.  Yeah, I'm always right.  Come on.  You're worried about Louie dumps.  Nobody cares.  Nobody cares.  The first thing you notice, Chaz, when he came in and did that cold a couple months ago,  I know it's his piece and all, but like it was yesterday.  It was just like that.  He did it like it was yesterday.  He was talking.  Right.  Right.  And now you got the Voss version.  Louie, beans.  I want my money. 
[01:45:30]  That right there is the best.  Louie, beans.  Rewind, man.  Louie, beans.  He doesn't even, he can't even do a person yelling to another person.  No.  He can't even do a gambler, which he is.  And I'm talking hard.  Louie, beans.  The original is just smooth.  Oh, no seams.  Louie, beans.  I want my money.  Beans, you can't dodge me forever.  Come on.  What are you doing about?  What are you yelling about, huh? 
[01:46:00]  John, I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie, beans.  The guy who's 20.  I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie, beans.  I want to ask Colin Quinn what he thinks.  I guarantee that Chaz was like talking later to his friends and he's trying to relate.  He's like, yeah, they have this guy.  I guess he's like the show Jerko.  And they bring him in.  I do a scene with him.  That was it.  Yeah.  He's a retard, I think.  He's a retarded.  They laugh at him.  He's got like helmet head.  I think it was a Make-A-Wish Foundation thing that they were doing. 
[01:46:30]  They're charitable.  Louie, beans.  Louie, beans.  Louie, beans.  Louie, beans.  It's like doing a Meissner exercise.  Louie, beans.  Louie, beans.  Louie, beans.  I got a problem with this guy over here.  Louie, beans.  Louie, beans.  He's 20 and it's been two weeks now and every time he sees me, he keeps dodging me.  Should I crack him one or what?  Come on.  He wants his Girl Scout cookies. 
[01:47:00]  Sometimes violence is not the answer.  Shut up.  Is he a good friend of yours?  No, John.  I don't even like this guy.  Well, there's your answer right there.  Hey, look at it this way.  It cost you $20 to get rid of him, right?  He's never going to ask you for money again.  He's never going to bother you again, right?  He's out of your life for $20.  So forget about it.  Look, you're right, John.  You're always right.  Why are you always right?  You're right, John.  You're always right.  That's what he says to Bonnie.  You're right, Bonnie.  You're always right.  You're always right.  I should have got to see the old card in the scene instead of knocking it out with these 
[01:47:30]  losers.  You're right, Bonnie.  You're always right.  Except for the time you said, I do.  He can't even sigh, honestly.  No.  But do you hear the mucus build up at the beginning of every line?  Before he gets to the spittle, there's a mucus pull up.  Oh, yeah.  And then when he gets to John, when he says John, that J, it sounds like he's saying it  underwater.  You should have made them face each other so he'd spit in Chaz's face during the scene  and Chaz would crack him.  It's like he had to act in the middle of gargling. 
[01:48:00]  Louie Beans?  You know Louie Beans?  Louie Beans?  Louie Beans.  I want my money.  The guy's name is Louie Beans.  Louie Beans.  Two guys.  Greg Hughes.  Jim Norton.  Come here.  He's a bad actor.  You should bring him in to do all kinds of scenes from that movie.  I couldn't agree more.  From a lot of movies.  With different people.  Different guys.  Any actors out there who want to help us out from real movies? 
[01:48:30]  That would be great.  He's got the chops for us.  Because this is a solid bit that we've got to continue.  All right.  I love it.  What a brilliant bit.  What do you think of the Hillary...  You don't really care about the Hillary Obama thing, right?  It's just rehashing the same crap.  What the hell kind of intro was that?  Let's go into Scorch.  See, that's what I was getting at.  I was going to go down that road.  I'm thinking it's going to be who gives a crap stuff, man. 
[01:49:00]  She won Pennsylvania.  She was supposed to win Pennsylvania.  Right.  Whatever.  Oh, yeah.  You know, the brothers are pitching a fit this morning, but that's what happens.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  We lost.  They must have miscounted or something.  Mm-hmm.  Well, what's next?  What does she have to win next?  Anybody know?  Indiana.  Indiana.  Let me think of a song.  Two weeks.  Pennsylvania.  Indiana.  We're going to do it.  What's that from?  No.  You're going to show it? 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Oh, God.  Oh, I heard this story.  Oh, you heard it.  You sure are.  It's so horrid.  I heard it.  You sure you heard it?  I tell you.  Oh, but sometimes I put it, like, last week, I just, if I wake up at, like, 6.30 in the  morning, just put it on the show for a few minutes, I fall back to sleep.  Last week, I put it on literally one thing.  Some dumbass calls in and goes, well, why don't you have Colin push Jerry's car?  And I hear Anthony explain, oh, yeah, when Colin pushed Jerry's car, and Norton, and  I wish I could have, he goes, ha, ha, with, like, the meanest little spider.  I wanted to get up again and come in again. 
[01:50:00]  I was so mad.  I wanted to come in.  I was fuming.  Ha, ha.  Idiots.  We miss the days where you would just come strolling in, because we said something,  next thing you know, the door opens, and your hair is askew, and you're pretty much wearing  your bathrobe still, just to confront whoever's talking bad about the other show.  Yeah, holy Colin.  You live too close to the studio, I'm thinking.  We gotta, like, move you out somewhere else.  Did you hear the listener that had the good little joke about the Popemobile breaking  down and you coming out?  Yeah, that's the line.  I was just having a call.  Yeah.  But if you can get that and isolate Jim's cruel little mean little laugh. 
[01:50:30]  Cruel.  I really wanted to come in and punch him in his face so badly.  That's exactly what happened.  It was early in the morning.  I just thought, let's do the show before I fall back asleep, you know, a few minutes.  Oh, it made me livid.  Oh, it was livid.  Why don't we do a little fun story before the break?  Yes.  You know, the news likes to do this.  We're taking our cues from the news today.  Here's a fun little story to make everyone a little happy today.  Well, who says dominoes are just for kids and Istanbul, they're for adults.  More specifically, adults who want to break records. 
[01:51:00]  A group of 15 people worked together for nine days to set up this 165,000 domino landscape.  It's meant to be Istanbul's.  It was part of Turkey's celebration of Children's Day.  It was part of Turkey's celebration of the Dominican Republic.  Who says dominoes are just for kids?  Nobody in the Bronx, from what I remember.  No.  Dominos.  I love you, the dominoes.  Dominos.  You know, if you take the bike path, it goes along the Hudson River, and you go a bit too 
[01:51:30]  far north.  Yeah.  Man, you want to see dominoes going down.  Yeah.  Happy dominoes.  And it's not the kids playing.  No, it's not.  And they're not playing for fun either, man.  They're playing for a few dollars.  They got some bucks on the game.  They got their car table set up all over this one park up there, and they're dominoing their  asses off.  And they got some of that rap slash Hispanic music playing.  Oh, yeah.  What is it called?  Rigatoni. 
[01:52:00]  Rigatoni.  Rigatoni.  Great stuff with a little sauce.  And these guys, they set up their car speakers like massive speakers.  One car over here, one car over there, and man, what comes out of those speakers.  You got out of there alive.  And it's a radio station that's broadcasting out here in New York.  But then they always, you know.  Reggaeton, right?  Or something like that?  Yeah.  Reggaeton.  Yeah.  So go ahead.  Whatever.  So dominoes isn't just for kids.  It's just a little.  It is certainly not a, it's a contact sports.  Domino landscape.  It's meant to be Istanbul's.  It was part of Turkey's celebration of Children's Day. 
[01:52:30]  This domino display broke the Turkish record.  Oof.  Well, there you go.  That's the most unimportant record I've ever heard.  The dominoes record in Turkey?  I am Turkish.  I always wanted to hear Midnight Express.  Oh, yeah.  Turkey.  Bily eyes.  Turkish prison.  When a fat man's head was cracked against a coat hanger.  In a coat hook.  You know what, dude?  That scene, dude.  You're right.  Bobby could play that part. 
[01:53:00]  Of course he could.  Oh, yeah.  Of course he could.  His shape and his sexuality.  Or the two little children.  Little fat kids.  He's just walking down the street.  After he beat some poor bastard's feet with a cane.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, what a cruel guy he was.  He got his comeuppance.  Sounds like a real character.  Mm-hmm.  You ever see it in a monster's wall?  And she's telling this story right before having Billy Bob go at it.  She goes, and then you do this.  She goes, sounds like a real character.  You ever have Billy Bob in here? 
[01:53:30]  You should have him in Wars do a scene.  We'd love to.  Best sex scene ever, though, in that movie.  Oh, I agree.  Oh, my God.  That was good.  She just needs it.  Yeah, that was great.  Oh, she starts yelling.  Oh, wow.  Is that after Patrice got run over?  Better sex scene in a mainstream movie.  We've done this many times.  Mainstream.  Oh, that was an amazing life.  That was probably the best sex scene in regular movie history. 
[01:54:00]  And don't say nine and a half weeks.  That's the most overrated effing sex scene.  Keep the food out of it.  I agree.  Right there.  Dad.  I would say, what about.  Dude.  What about.  What about grumpier old men?  And Margaret needs it.  That thing calls on, man.  This weekend with Colin Quinn.  212-757-4100.  The Swimming Pool.  Yeah.  Remember that one?  What was that? 
[01:54:30]  I don't know, but Opie turned me on to this movie, and he was talking about it for a while.  This is a while ago.  I don't even know who turned me on to, but it's a movie from 2003.  Yeah.  It's called Swimming Pool.  So Opie tells me about this, and I noticed one day it's on cable.  So I turned it on, and I had to call Opie up during this movie and just go, oh my God,  this is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.  I forgot all about it.  The movie sucks, but this chick that's in it is naked half the time.  She is really hot.  Basically, the story goes, she goes to live with her aunt or an older relative in the middle 
[01:55:00]  of nowhere in France or something, and she has a swimming pool.  And this older woman, she's like a writer, and she's there trying to write her latest novel.  Yeah, get rid of her writer's block.  And her young, whether it's a niece or whatever, is just a nymph, just effing all day and all  night as this woman's trying to write her novel.  And she's getting turned on by the noises that are coming from the other room, and she's  taking a peek at her while she's sunbathing next to the pool. 
[01:55:30]  It's just crazy, crazy stuff, man.  There's a scene that E-Rock has put up over there.  Yeah.  But see, that's the old hag, though.  And then the old hag gets naked by the end of the movie.  Oh my God, and it looks like she's got the black sheep of the family in her lap.  And she finally gets some action from the gardener or something.  I don't know.  Put up a still of that girl.  I'll tell you what I liked.  It was like that, too.  That movie with the sirens.  You ever see that one with Elle McPherson and all the naked girls on the...  Look at that.  Oh yeah, she is pretty amazing. 
[01:56:00]  First Wives Club.  Oh yeah, they let those guys have it.  Oh, don't they?  Those sassy girls.  Ladies, come on.  Jimmy, look at that.  Where?  Look at that.  Oh my God.  Because the girl's all innocent, and the lady's by the pool just trying to get some work done,  and all of a sudden she comes over to her all topless just to talk to her about life and stuff.  Is there any lesbian sex?  Like the old school?  I don't remember.  I haven't seen this.  I think it's the undercurrent that's very exciting.  This came out in 2003. 
[01:56:30]  It got actually really good reviews for one of those art films.  Yeah, look at this.  But that's not why people...  Look at this.  She poked out of the pool at night to take care of a guy who just happens to be sitting  on the edge of the pool.  Yeah, the guy's sitting on the edge of the pool, and she just swims up.  That's what kind of made the movie is this old broad just taking a look at all this craziness  this young girl's up there.  She's just watching this young hose bag.  Yeah.  Well, maybe that's why we like it, because you don't have to do anything.  You can just be like, okay, watch it.  Look at that, Jim.  You know, it's a sexy movie.  You ever see Failure to Launch?  It's funny, but it's also... 
[01:57:00]  Failure to Launch.  What is that?  Well, it's a movie where Sarah Jessica Parker gets hired by the parents to get her son out  of the house, because he won't leave.  He loves living at home with his friends.  He's sort of like, in many ways, a glorified child.  They have fun.  They go like, you know...  Oh, my God.  You love awful movies.  Colin's...  I really do.  That is awful.  I've watched all those horrible...  Rumor has it...  You ever see that?  DiPaolo turned me on to that one.  How is it?  He...  It's so bad.  I can't believe...  He won an opium segment, that breakup movie. 
[01:57:30]  That's on the upper end.  I've seen that movie.  Right.  It's on the upper end of those movies.  It's not as bad as most of them.  But even in that movie, they have a ridiculous...  He's like a tour guide of Chicago.  How do you audition for that movie?  For what?  Not the Vince Vaughn part.  That's right.  You did.  We do have to take a break.  Colin.  Caroline's.  This weekend, starting Friday.  2-1-2-7-5-7-4-1-100.  I highly recommend you go see...  Hold on.  It's available. 
[01:58:00]  Now that Colin has taken care of his issues, I highly recommend you go see Colin and Caroline's.  I would plug Chicago, but two sold-out shows.  Why mention it?  Oh, come on.  Where are you?  He doesn't need to stay.  He only says when he needs a little help-ski.  May 2nd, Pittsburgh.  I need some help-ski.  There you go.  That's Pittsburgh.  That's what they call it there.  Help-ski, those Pollocks.  Sorry.  In honor of Colin being here, we got Scorch audio just for you, my friend.  Yay, Scorch!  Scorch!  And you gotta explain why you love Scorch so much again, because I love your take on the Scorch. 
[01:58:30]  But after the break, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony and the great Colin Quinn.  And sometimes I wish the fans could hear what we say on the breaks.  That's even crazier.  We're gonna tape that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And Jim Norton's here today, too.  Oh, yeah.  Mr. Chicago.  Mr. Chicago's here.  Don't talk to him.  It'll end up on his radio show.  Don't let him behave.  I just always say that Jim might end up in his book. 
[01:59:00]  It is blah.  Oh, ho, ho.  I love when that happens.  It's for anyone listening, whenever I'm hanging out with you somewhere, and you say,  Hey, I better watch out.  This is gonna end up on your radio show.  It won't.  It's not.  Never good.  It wasn't funny or entertaining.  Not on that, but you're still keeping secrets about where you go on the weekends, if I remember  correctly.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Do I?  It's a little more open now.  Not that much of an open book.  What did you do?  Go to Erie, PA and then switch flights?  Erie, PA.  Good old Erie. 
[01:59:30]  What are you, in junior high, you're making kissing noises?  Colin's hysterical, man.  Oh, Anthony.  Oh, what are you?  Am I supposed to go, stop?  Anthony is a friend of mine.  He resembles Frankenstein.  Hey, when he goes out on a date.  I was like, fight, fight.  Whoa, whoa.  Okay.  But we all know it.  Suffice to say, the ending is one turns red and one drops dead. 
[02:00:00]  And then, of course, there's eeny, meeny, miny, moe.  Oh, yes.  Who are we catching by the toe?  Well, figure it out.  I can't believe Hillary said that last night.  It's one thing to win, but to gloat like that.  In that fashion.  It's a little racist.  That's Freddy from Jamaica Station.  Stephen S. gets credit.  The rundowns have been hysterical lately.  He's been smashing the hell out of you guys.  Good.  You can read the rundowns on onaradio.com.  Imagine if, because I have not read the rundown.  They're great.  In probably a week, a week and a half. 
[02:00:30]  And how funny it would be if he just really was bashing us.  Not even in a fun or sarcastic way, but just harshly beating up on us.  After all the things we've said about him, I wouldn't blame him.  I wouldn't either.  Scorch.  Yeah, Scorch.  Colin loves this guy, Scorch.  Just a little back history really fast.  Ant and I, back in the day when we were working in Worcester, we worked at the same radio station  as Scorch.  Scorch.  There was something about him.  We loved the guy from the first day we met him, and he would come in with a boom box,  and he would set up his kingdom of nakedness. 
[02:01:00]  Even though he didn't get naked or anything, but he had the illusion that he did naked radio.  Naked radio.  He just had this whole, yeah, everything was like radio.  It was like a weird, like, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  He just had a way about him, man.  He was really, really into his kingdom of nakedness.  Totally nude radio.  Totally nude.  Naked militia.  And then poor Sam started interning with us, young Sam, really wanted to get into radio.  And then we found out that he was going to Syracuse University, right?  Syracuse?  And I go, wow, we got an old friend that does radio up there. 
[02:01:30]  His name's Scorch.  So we basically forced young Sam onto Scorch, right?  That was great.  Yeah.  Yes.  He's never been the same, Sam.  And then Sam did, like, his internship up there while he was at school, and then,  you know, a gig opened up here, and here's young Sam waiting for the show.  Does Colin know about Scorch's color of the day?  Oh, the new color and number of the day?  I think, I don't remember.  This was where Scorch would just give out the color of the day. 
[02:02:00]  He'd be like, yeah, all right, the color and the number.  Like, all right, today we're looking at brown 17.  Oh.  Just, but there would be nothing else to it.  But it's like a unifying theme for the Scorch listeners.  Yeah, yeah, because then they would know, and he said people would look forward to the  next day to see what the color was.  That part, I can't believe.  No, who could?  And you're sitting there waiting for the sarcasm or something, and it never happens.  We got the actual bit.  It's 20 seconds.  We got to do this for you. 
[02:02:30]  Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.  I'm going to guess blue 43.  All right.  Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up.  Today the color is what they say here, working man's brown.  It must be working man's brown.  The number is five, so it is working man's brown and five.  What does that mean?  What does it even mean?  He brings up some good points.  I was thinking about all these crazy cooking shows.  There's just too many cooking shows.  I mean, I'm sick of them.  You know the brothers in Philly have a brilliant thing they do. 
[02:03:00]  I was on the show with Color of the Day.  They'll have a Color of the Day, and they all, guys in the neighborhood, all wear the  same color shirt, like white shirt and jeans.  This way there's a problem with the cops looking for a young male in a blue shirt and jeans.  There's 150 guys with blue shirts.  Is that real?  Oh, yeah.  I stood on a police show.  I thought, how brilliant is that?  Very interesting.  Are the ONA pests listening?  It's all the ONA pests.  What's tomorrow's color?  That's a pretty good idea.  Let's make them have to wear a really awful color, like pink. 
[02:03:30]  Fuchsia.  Right.  Periwinkle.  Periwinkle and pink.  Periwinkle.  All ONA pests have to wear periwinkle and pink tomorrow.  You're going to get sued by Scorch.  Right, yeah.  You're ripping me off.  Hoo-hoo.  I bet you there's a lot of people in the Syracuse area playing the Scorch numbers now.  Yeah.  Probably bedding and back alleys and back rooms and stuff, waiting for the color and the number.  Yeah, but now he's going to say five.  He's going to be one of the other colors.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  So we've got brand new Scorch stuff.  It's Scorch's top names for Food Network shows. 
[02:04:00]  Really?  Yeah.  There are a lot of those shows.  I'd love to see some.  Well, I think these are the top rejected shows, by the way.  If Sam's correct, when I was talking to Sam before, shows that couldn't make it.  Yeah, a little too racy.  Reason will be obvious.  Here's the great Scorch.  We're going to talk about shows that I came up with for the Food Network.  Some of these shows, I don't think they would like to have.  Some of them, I think, really have a chance to make it.  Uh-oh.  Tell me what you think.  For instance, the Chef Lollipop Show. 
[02:04:30]  You know what I mean?  The Chef Lollipop Making Show.  And it's called, Mmm, That Is a Great Cook Sucker.  You know?  Whoa.  That might not be that.  Wait, wait.  That might not be that.  What's a cook?  A lollipop, you suck on it.  Yeah, but a cook's sucker.  I don't get it.  The cook made the sucker.  The cook made it.  Yeah, it's like a.  But wouldn't that be a cook's sucker?  Yes, or a cook.  They'd probably call it a cook's lollipop.  Right.  No one calls a lollipop a sucker.  Yeah, a sucker.  Don't be jealous.  Usually when you guys wouldn't have the guts to do that.  What's next? 
[02:05:00]  What's next?  What's next?  And it's called, Mmm, That Is a Great Cook Sucker.  You know?  That might not really have time to make it.  That might not be the easiest.  I agree with him.  To get through the censors.  The cook's sucker.  Nope.  Don't go there.  The cook's sucker.  He knows how to sell it, though.  I like that one.  Huh?  I like that one.  You like that one?  Yeah.  How about this?  I was going to have a show based on soups, but the soups weren't made from meat. 
[02:05:30]  They were made from, you know, the muscles and the tendons and the bones, and the show  is going to be called, I Want to Bone You.  Oh!  Wait a minute.  I Want to Bone You with the Bones.  There's bones in the soup.  It's not meat, but bones.  Just bones in the soup.  Yeah.  And, and...  The funniest part of the whole thing is you guys making poor Sam go up and intern for him.  Yeah.  What a nightmare.  Why is soup involved with boning you?  Yeah.  Why should it just be, I'll take the meat off and serve bones? 
[02:06:00]  Where does...  The whole thing is horrendous.  Why are you picking that part?  Yeah, yeah.  How about we start with the concept?  Like the expression soup to bones.  Like you, basically you're saying I accept the concept of the bit, but now we got to like  pick it apart.  Right, right.  But he's right though about, about cook soccer.  Like that would never go.  He is actually able to give him a point.  Oh, is that what he's doing?  Proving a point?  You know what?  Some of the shows, I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't go these days.  Guys, Colin, you know who?  You want the Bachelor? 
[02:06:30]  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, you guys should have the, uh, hmm, uh, the...  Oh, he's like, this is problematic.  Uh-oh.  Well, we should have the colored of the day.  Oh, I got ya.  But then he said we should have done that during Black History Month.  That's, uh, Steven S. from Bayshore with that witty line.  Oh, new.  Come on, how can you beat I want to bone you, you know?  Oh, God.  And this one really could have the chance to make it.  This one is a barbecue show where the girls are just wearing bikinis and thongs and next 
[02:07:00]  to nothing, and the show is called Grills Gone Wild.  Come on, that is a winner right there.  That's a good one.  Come on, that is a winner right there.  This is crazy.  Scorch knows what he's got in front of him.  Does he?  Yes, exactly.  A big steaming pile of Nagel.  Oh, I was going to go radio Nagel.  He doesn't even look up and laugh.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  E-Rock's texting. 
[02:07:30]  E-Rock.  He hates that.  Let's ask him on air.  I want to know what this bit's about.  He does not like this bit at all.  What is this bit, E-Rock?  Oh, I didn't hear it.  Oh.  Oh.  Aren't you paying attention?  Aren't you above the fray?  He's not even paying attention.  He didn't want to hear.  How do we expect the listeners to pay attention if the guy seven feet to my left isn't paying  attention?  E-Rock, what about that?  I don't know.  It's not my bit.  Ask Sam what that bit's about.  Sam?  Comment?  You know, it was a throwaway line at the time that I regret because I feel like it's 
[02:08:00]  gone wild and hurt people's feelings.  Throwaway line that was repeated over and over and over.  I know.  They just repeated it after I threw it out there.  See, Colin, quickly to bring you up to speed.  Around the office now, well, just for a little fun, off the air.  Whenever you refer to crap, instead of saying the S word, you say Nagel, which is E-Rock's  last name.  I get it.  So you go, oh my God, I stepped in some Nagel yesterday and I had to scrape it off my shoe.  And he hates it. 
[02:08:30]  Of course he does.  The Nagels have a long and proud history of being destroyed in one month here on the  show.  They arrived from Eastern Russia during the first, you know, pogroms of the early 20th century.  I don't know if that you said a long and proud history.  So E-Rock, what happens?  That bet just bugs you, gets you a little bit?  Not one of my favorite, no.  E-Rock, you got to fight back.  Which one's favorite, Mayo?  A little fighting back.  Exactly.  All right, Scorch continues.  The Boys of Simmer. 
[02:09:00]  You know what I mean?  You want to just make...  Oh, God!  You can't just have the clean...  You can't arbitrarily set up the list and you have these filthy cook sluker and then  have it filled up with the Boys of Simmer.  Yeah, the Boys of Simmer.  It sounds like Boys of Summer.  Oh!  That actually doesn't make sense.  Yeah, but if he did those first and then he got to the dirty ones later, you can't  just throw him randomly.  He's an idiot.  Why are you trying to fix this bit?  I just think of him brainstorming this and thinking, let me think.  Oh, look. 
[02:09:30]  Simmer.  All right.  First, he started with cooking words is what he started with.  Okay, cook.  Simmer.  Soup.  Summer.  And then just went through.  It's like, okay.  Simmer.  Simmer.  Summer.  Boys of Simmer.  Boys of Simmer.  I got one.  Colm, when you were getting great comedians for your tough crowd, why not Scorch?  If I had thought...  I mean, does he do stand-up too?  We were only using my cast to do stand-up, but I mean...  He could do stand-up.  He could do it all.  He probably used to do stand-up.  He could do it all.  That's your official reason why you never invited us on the show? 
[02:10:00]  Because we didn't do stand-up.  I did invite you guys on, I believe, many times.  Many times, yes.  Couldn't come because there's no...  Couldn't talk.  Oh, really?  At this time, I thought that you just didn't want us on the show.  What did you guys do all the time?  Actually, if you...  Didn't you have Stalker Patty on?  Yes.  All right.  So...  Chums instead of Friends.  That was the show?  They did a parody of Friends.  Chums.  Chums.  Chums, right.  Here's more cooking shows.  Simmer Lovin'.  Patty was great.  Where was Patty?  Simmer Lovin'.  Ask me to dance.  Simmer Lovin'.  Simmer Lovin'.  Patty's now working for Ron and Fez, so... 
[02:10:30]  Ow.  She's parlaying...  Oh, my God.  Her success into a game with Ron and Fez.  I'm on multiple shows now.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You want to just make, like, other sautéed sauces and things like that?  The boys of Simmer.  Come on.  How are you going to beat that?  You know?  You can't touch it.  Here's another one.  If we're a sauté person, how about Sauté Day Night Fever?  Oh, no.  No, he didn't say that.  But if he at least set it up first with, like, hey, how about a show with Brooklyn with dancing?  But he doesn't... 
[02:11:00]  Only other ones get a big set-up.  That way, he just goes into it.  Sauté Night Fever.  Because it's sautéing in the show.  Hey, you always touch my pasta.  Stop touching my pasta.  Gonna sauté.  Gonna sauté.  You happy now?  See?  Now you're a cannoli.  You can't tell by the way I used my walk.  I'm a woman's man.  This one, I feel good.  This one, I'm cooking down at the restaurant. 
[02:11:30]  Sauté Night Fever.  What the hell is that?  Sauté Day Night.  Oh, Sauté Day.  It isn't even, like, just sauté.  It's brilliant and it's stupidity.  You gotta give him that much.  But can't you leave that song on and make him do Dice Clay and Scorch in a scene from  Sauté Night Fever?  That would be a lot of elements there, Taller.  Hey, come back over here.  Stop dancing on the bridge.  You're gonna hurt yourself. 
[02:12:00]  Get over here.  Hey, look, I'm dancing, Tony.  You didn't call me.  You didn't call me, Tony.  Hey, look.  I'm sorry.  I borrowed your car and I said I was gonna call you.  And I didn't.  I hurt my knee, dude.  Anthony's overheating because of you, Colin.  Too many elements in the pit.  What are you, crazy?  Anthony never gets confused.  He started as Travolta and went into Dice.  And then he went to Andrew Dice Kelly at the end. 
[02:12:30]  And a little Andrew Dice Kelly.  Andrew Dice Kelly.  All right, well, according to Sam, Scorch brings it home in a big way with his final part  of the bit here.  Yeah, he knows how to close it.  All right.  And the best one of all was one where it was gonna be.  He tells you what the best one of all was.  And I'm not into seeing men, you know, undressing or anything like that.  All right, Scorch.  What could it be?  It was gonna be a show with some of the best-looking men in the world.  And it was gonna be meant specifically for women.  And the show was gonna be called, excuse me,  Your Fry is Open. 
[02:13:00]  See?  All these shows.  Oh.  I actually can't say all of them.  Some of them might not make it because of the title.  Oh, you know what?  Grills Gone Wild?  Come on, how can you beat that?  A show with scantily clad women barbecuing food?  Guys, you have to agree with me.  Something like that would definitely be P-F-G.  Oh, yeah.  His new show is called P-F-G.  That's what it is.  It's Scorch P-F-G.  P-F-G.  Which means the P and the G is pretty good.  Great.  Great. 
[02:13:30]  Sorry.  I just remembered.  Pretty great.  And you could, you know, just imagine what that is.  Oh, yes.  Don't go there.  I get it.  P-F-G.  Pretty effing glad we're not doing that type of radio.  It would be something funny about your gals in bikinis on that sautéing show.  Grills Gone Wild.  We should, like, take some of these ideas and just run with it.  You really, you know what you should do?  I just set up a grill and studio show.  Right.  Hey, that was my idea. 
[02:14:00]  What the F?  He gets a job, though, man.  He gets fired every six months and there's another station waiting for him, man.  Right?  Yeah, just a couple of markets below the...  I can't even keep track of all the stations he's worked for.  Since we moved on.  And he got one of the greatest firings ever.  The PD actually told him he was pizza.  Yeah.  And the PD was looking for a hamburger.  Yeah.  That just kills me.  That's how I think about it.  It's not that, like, pizza isn't good.  People love pizza, but...  Scorch sat us down his last day at the station. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, guys, I just got fired.  And explained the whole story how Dave Dickless sits him down and goes,  I'm looking for a hamburger around here.  And you're pizza.  You're pizza.  Pizza's a good food.  Pizza's good.  People love pizza.  But we're looking for hamburger.  Meanwhile, there's, like, no distinction if you're going to mention, like, a food manager.  Pizza or hamburger would be the same category.  Yeah, exactly.  It's not like...  Yeah, it's a stupid analogy to make.  Yeah.  But Dave was stupid. 
[02:15:00]  On so many levels.  We're going to play a pizza or hamburger today.  Pizza or hamburger.  Call up.  Tell me what you'd rather have.  I'll tell you what I'd like to do.  Go home and watch that movie, The Pool.  What's it called?  Swimming Pool.  Swimming Pool.  Colin, write it down.  Let me write this out for you, because you're going to get all confused, and you're going  to see some dumb movie that's not...  Oh, that's where you're wrong.  Y'all watch The Swim with Burt Lancaster.  Love that movie.  Oh, God.  I'm swimming through people's backyards.  Why?  Swimming Pool.  Why?  Swimming Pool.  That movie stunk.  I watched it as a kid, and I just thought I was too young to get it.  There you go.  And then I watched it when I got older and was like, no, it's just a stupid movie. 
[02:15:30]  2002, because I think this was a remake.  Believe it or not, they had to remake this movie, Swimming Pool, from 2003.  Sorry, William Shatner.  Okay.  Believe it or not, it's not the first name that came to mind.  It's not the second name that came to mind.  I think you have Tommy Lee on the tip of your tongue.  There we go.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  Colin Quinn, it's always a pleasure.  You've got Caroline's this weekend.  212-757-4100 starting Friday night. 
[02:16:00]  Right?  Anything else?  Jimmy Jackson.  Jimmy Jackson.  Jimmy Jackson.  Oh, let's see.  Yeah, Colin's obsessed with Ant's old family member there.  My childhood.  Well, he was just a friend of the family.  Friend of the family, I should say.  Jimmy Jackson.  Do you love Jimmy Jackson stories?  Run his rent string.  My favorite Jimmy Jackson story was him trying to sell the dead horse.  The dead horse.  Actually, my favorite was him riding the drunk in the chariot down the street.  And the horse ran between two parked cars and the chariot couldn't fit. 
[02:16:30]  So it just wiped out two cars.  But the best was he convinced someone to buy a dead horse.  He was able to show that the horse was still alive even though it was as dead as dead is.  Yeah, he said he had to tranquilize it because it was so full of spirit.  Right.  How great is that?  Jimmy Jackson rules.  All right, remind us.  We've got to do our Jimmy Jackson stories on the next Opie and Anthony show.  Colin, thank you so much.  Colin, always a pleasure.  Give us a nice little boost of energy today.  Thanks.  Sorry I got serious there for a moment. 
[02:17:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Most of you guys can't handle serious.  I noticed that about you.  No.  All right.  Make a joke.  F off.  We'll see you guys soon.  Hey.  XM 202. </pre>
