<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a rambling introduction featuring nonsensical references and a song segment.  Opie and Anthony discussed their weekend plans, Anthony's scratchy throat, and childhood memories of novelty items like sneezing powder and x-ray glasses, leading to a sexually charged discussion about observing women and reactions to public nudity.  They recounted an incident where Kenny's car was damaged by a tour bus, debating responsibility. This segued into a message from Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney, including a voice recording and signed photo, obtained through deception about Anthony's identity.  The show then shifted to criticism of government spending and the political climate, followed by more speculation about Maroney's message.  Upcoming birthdays, particularly E-Rock's, were mentioned, along with a disastrous Club Med experience. Random topics included a viral helicopter-herding-deer video, complaints about excessive TV news graphics, the declining popularity of Apple products, and the anticipated Apple Watch.  The segment concluded with anticipation for Donald Trump Jr.'s upcoming appearance and further discussion of Scott Weiland and Stone Temple Pilots (STP), culminating in playing some of their music.

The next segment began with Opie and Anthony playing a song, possibly self-composed, referencing "Bullhorn," and comparing its sound to strip club music.  The conversation then turned to STP and the reported firing of Scott Weiland. Doug Breon, guitarist for the Wild Bouts, called in to clarify it was a publicity stunt.  They discussed a TMZ clip of Weiland, speculating about his sobriety and the band's dynamics, describing their relationship as primarily business-oriented.  They mentioned a new STP tour, "Purple to the Corridor." The show then covered Islanders goalie Rick DiPietro's struggles, playing a clip of his interview. A significant portion focused on a Twitter feud with Ralphie May, centering on a past incident involving a naked, intoxicated woman outside their studio and May's alleged exaggeration of his role in resolving the situation.  The hosts vehemently denied May's claims of turning down the show twice.  Donald Trump Jr. then appeared as a guest in studio. The conversation covered his son's birthday, fatherhood (including diaper changing), his preference for coach travel over private jets, his fishing and hunting hobbies (planning a fly-fishing trip with Opie), Celebrity Apprentice (mentioning Gene Simmons's firing and the intensity of filming), and the drinking habits of various celebrities.

Donald Trump Jr.â€™s in-studio appearance continued into the next segment, discussing his business ventures (golf courses in Scotland, Miami, and India), a golf injury at Doral, his views on Augusta National allowing women members (expressing a preference for men's-only clubs), political correctness, excessive regulations, union practices (using Hostess bankruptcy as an example), and gun control laws in New York.  He further discussed Celebrity Apprentice contestants. A call-in section followed, featuring a listener's birthday and banter.  The segment concluded with discussion of an upcoming comedy tour, logistical challenges, and jokes about Jim Norton's tour and the potential for a chaotic multi-bus tour, including a designated "party bus." Vulgar language and offensive jokes were prevalent.

The show then opened with jokes about one of the hosts having a boner, transitioning to a discussion about Brazilian steakhouses ("churrascarias") and strategies for maximizing enjoyment of higher-quality meats, referencing Patrice O'Neal's advice.  The hosts discussed their gym routines, Jimmy's impressive pull-ups, a creepy gym-goer ("Peter Pumper"), and the juice bar lady's differential treatment of them.  Leone, a delivery man from Brooklyn Italian Heroes, arrived with sandwiches, promoting his business and mentioning a planned Joe Paterno sandwich.  E-Rock (celebrating his birthday) and the hosts sampled the sandwiches.  A clip about a radio station's $10,000 promotional contest with poor production quality was played.  The main topic became a news story about a six-year-old transgender child and the school restroom controversy.  The hosts discussed the parents' account and the school's policy, conversing with a caller, Bailey J, about personal experiences and perspectives on transgender identity and the complexities of gender identity at a young age.  The discussion included interspersed comments and jokes.

This discussion about the six-year-old transgender girl continued into another segment, debating safety and legal ramifications, exploring the broader topic of transgender identity (whether it's a choice, sexual orientation for transgender individuals, personal experiences). Bailey J, a transgender woman, called in, sharing her personal experiences, including her family and husband. The conversation included explicit discussion of genitalia, sexual acts, and sexual preferences.  Jim Norton's comedy tour and show-related matters were briefly mentioned.  Birthday wishes for E-Rock were offered, along with discussions of upcoming events and a Dollar Shave Club advertisement. Sam Roberts was frequently referenced and participated, along with several callers. The tone was informal and included vulgar language.

The show concluded with a brief segment mentioning upcoming segments (Alan's idea, Roland's food court, Scott Baio on Sam Roberts' show), Eric's birthday, Ron and Fez's show, a rude farewell ("Go fuck yourself"), and the closing announcement.

[00:01:30]  Good morning, everyone.  It's Friday.  We're here.  Wake up, everybody.  Oh, boy.  We get it.  It's Friday.  Friday, Friday.  And by Friday, you know what I mean?  What?  Monday will seem like it comes in a second.  Monday is going to seem like Tuesday.  It's just there.  Because Tuesday will be my Monday.  Every Wednesday is Sunday at Carvel. 
[00:02:00]  Wait a minute.  No.  What?  Hoping to take Monday off.  Oh.  Yeah.  Well.  Well, we did a five-day work week finally.  Wow.  Is it a holiday or something?  Oh.  Oh.  You okay?  I don't know.  My throat's a little scratchy.  There is something going around.  I'll be fine today, but I sure hope it doesn't get worse over the weekend.  I heard that.  Oh, man.  I have heard of that.  I have heard of that. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Give me some of that sneezing powder.  You're too young for that shit, Sam.  Growing up in the 80s, man, we had some cool shit.  Like, remember sneezing powder?  Snuff?  That's stuff like they used to use in the old days?  I don't know.  Look it up.  Sneezing powder.  You could buy it.  Yeah?  Before there was Spencer's Gifts.  On the back of comics?  With Spencer Gifts?  Yeah.  Spencer.  Spencer!  Yeah, you would buy it in the back of, I don't know, Mad Magazine or something.  It was called, yeah, fucking sneezing powder. 
[00:03:00]  And I think all it was was like fucking...  Some peppery stuff?  Yeah, some kind of peppery.  There it is!  Holy shit.  There it is!  Sneezing powder.  I love those old gags.  Those are the most fun things to get as a kid.  Yeah.  This is double strength sneezing powder.  I ordered x-ray glasses off of one of those things one time.  Did you?  And...  I'm disappointed when they didn't work.  Why?  No, they don't work.  You don't know how to use them properly.  Trick gum?  Spearmint or fruit?  Fruit, please.  Didn't taste any fruit, though, did it? 
[00:03:30]  No.  No.  You gotta put the x-ray glasses on.  Garlic gum.  And then you gotta walk around your neighborhood.  Oh, that's right.  And then when you see some young lady changing in her window, you don't feel guilty because  you're like, whoa, I got my x-ray fucking glasses on.  You should just wear those on the subway and just look at chicks and go, whoa!  Holy shit!  Whoa!  Can I steal that?  That's wacky enough for me.  I'll take that.  I'll take that.  I'll take that one.  That'd be great.  X-ray specs.  You just watch girls get all fucking uncomfortable because they're too stupid to realize they 
[00:04:00]  don't work.  I swear to y'all, I want to do that video.  Do it.  It'd be hilarious.  If that's the one that goes viral, man.  Whoa!  I'll do that one.  That'd be so dumb.  Or me some x-ray specs.  Get some x-ray specs.  The old school, yeah, those that look just completely ridiculous.  You need this concentric circular pattern on the lens, you know, to look all hypnotized-y.  What's the principle that they do work?  What do they do? 
[00:04:30]  Nothing.  Supposedly, here's what it does.  There's little pinholes in it, and it shuts off so much light that all you see is a silhouette  of the person.  So you don't see their clothes, but you see a form that, theoretically, if they were wearing  form-fitting clothes, a leotard, you would see a shadow of them looking naked because  that's all you'd see.  They look like an x-ray.  It doesn't see through their clothes, but they look like an x-ray.  Exactly.  Oh, yuck.  Terrible.  What was the one thing we did years ago? 
[00:05:00]  It was something with a camera.  Oh, that was the night vision, the night shot.  On a certain camera, though, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And it was a big news story.  They realized a certain camera, if you put it on a night shot...  And then put some kind of a negative over the lens, you'd see almost like a heat signature  of the person through clothing.  You absolutely saw some shit.  Tide-fitting black clothing worked best, but you'd see nipples and fucking pussy and ass  crack and shit. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, we tried it.  It absolutely worked.  Yeah, I have a night shot camera still.  What is sexier than when you see somebody walking, and a woman, and the light hits her, and you  get this...  Sundress.  Holy fuck.  Sundress.  It's so hot.  You just walk around following the person like a creep.  No, man.  Clumber over the head.  Oh, wait a minute.  You guys are amateurs.  Amateurs.  Yeah, man, you hunker down.  You find that one spot where the sun is hitting just right with a lot of people walking by.  And you hunker down for about...  Hunker.  ...two and a half hours. 
[00:06:00]  I hear you.  Bottom globe to the ass cheek.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Would you lose your mind if you saw, like, from the back, and you saw, like, puffy vagina  coming down like that?  It would make me...  I would have to catch my breath.  That's hot.  Yeah.  Yeah, look.  See?  There's her ass right there.  And that isn't even, like, the best one I've seen.  There it is. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  It worked, though.  It worked.  Night shot cameras, you'd see right through.  Yeah, you would see some stuff.  It's not bad, right?  See her ass through the thong and the bra strap and shit?  You think women love cheap thrills like guys do?  No.  You really don't think so?  Nah, because a guy will just whip his dick out and start walking down the street, and  women will be like, eh.  Like the subway.  Subway, a guy pulls his dick out and start jerking it, and girls freak out.  They take pictures.  They call the cops.  If a girl just pulled up a skirt and started fingering herself, guys would just be like,  fuck!  This rules! 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, it is a weird double standard.  But we have heard from the women that say, most of them that listen to our show say they  wouldn't be freaked out.  Liars.  You think they're lying?  Of course they are, because when it happens, they freak out.  If you're on a subway, and you have like a female flasher, you'd be out of your mind  happy.  And here's the other thing.  You'd be so happy.  A fucking chick, if it's a guy that looks like he's one from a fucking perfume commercial  on television, then they might go like, oh, look at him, ooh, look, his fly's open 
[00:07:30]  and I see some fucking bag.  I understand what you're saying, but I will stop you in your tracks.  Yeah.  If it's a fucking mess of a woman doing it on the subway, I'd still be into it.  That's what I was getting to.  All right.  That's exactly what I was getting to.  Girls, it has to be that dream guy.  Right.  And then they might not call the cops.  Right.  But for a guy, it could be a slob.  Yeah.  Even a slob doing something like that.  You're not going to call the cops.  It's kind of a turn on.  Right.  In a way, it's even more of a turn on, because you know they need it a little more, because 
[00:08:00]  they don't get it as much, because they're a slob.  Yeah.  They're slobbery.  You're a fucking pig.  Right.  Oh, you want it, but not many takers, right?  Don't you?  Yeah.  How long have you been, you fucking pig?  So you do try hard, don't you?  Yes.  I woke up to some porno this morning.  Wow.  That's a crazy way to wake up to.  Yeah.  I went to sleep, and I guess Cinemax, one of the Cinemax channels were on or something. 
[00:08:30]  And then Cinemax apparently changes their whole tune from about 4A to about 6A.  Skinamax.  Skinamax, whatever you want to call it.  And it's that soft core pornography, which is annoying.  No, I kind of like that stuff.  It was cool, because the girl was really hot, you know?  They show the boobies in the end?  Yeah, yeah.  They show the tits, the ass, the legs.  She was doing that thing where she's on her back, and the guy's fucking her, but her legs  are up, and the feet are just kind of going, eh. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  I love watching fucking fuck her when her feet are in the air, but they're kind of just  moving because she's being banged.  That's fucking hot.  The feet look dead.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, they're just kind of hanging there and shit, like an invalid during diaper change.  Yeah, it's fucking hot.  I guess Jimmy knows what that looks like.  I guess I do.  Oh, yes, I do.  He's all proud, yeah.  Fucking great.  But then they do that fake sex thing, where you're watching and going like, there's no 
[00:09:30]  way his dick is in her.  Yeah, whatever.  He's fucking her with his belly button.  Right.  And then you know he's too low, or the angle that their vagina and dick is at was all wrong.  But he's like, fucking her, and he's like, oh, making fuck faces.  You're like, that's impossible.  It's impossible.  The angles are all wrong.  I watched them make softcore porn and hardcore porn when I hosted the award show, and to  watch them shoot the softcore stuff is more impressive.  Wow.  Because it's harder.  Like, when they're just fucking, they're fucking.  Right. 
[00:10:00]  It was two guys and a girl, and I'm standing behind the director.  So when they had to do the softcore stuff, they were slamming just as hard, but like  their dick wasn't in, and they were a little bit all, and it was so much more work to shoot  the softcore stuff.  Wow.  So that's why.  Yeah, well, you gotta act, I guess.  You have to act.  You gotta act like you're fucking, instead of, you know, you're fucking.  You need some acting chops.  Acting chops.  And then there was, I forgot what movie it was, and I was kind of just waking up, but  I saw, I saw one of the chicks in the softcore one was somebody we've had in here. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah, it was some dumb blonde.  She was like, I don't think it's, I'm looking at, ha ha, we know you.  Seen her.  Did E-Rock abuse her, too?  I don't think it was E-Rock fucking punching her ass cheek.  It was, it was fucking, it was pretty hot, though.  Nice.  Yeah.  I drove in with Kenny's tiny car.  Oh, I saw it out front.  A little up, a little update to the big accident from yesterday's show.  Yeah.  Where a tour bus swiped Kenny's car, fucking taking it out of the game for a while. 
[00:11:00]  Uh-huh.  So Kenny picked me up today in an Ultima.  Yeah.  He is way too big for an Ultima.  Of course he is.  I was laughing, I go, I feel like we're, we're in a, we're in a skateboard, if that's possible.  It's a little clown car that he gets out of.  I don't know, he's gonna have, like, major back problems.  Yeah, he better get his car fixed.  He'll be driving you to Poconuts in that thing, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, I think we're growing up in that little thing.  That's perfect.  That's the way it should be.  I should be driven to Poconuts in an Ultima. 
[00:11:30]  That's exactly what my weekend is.  With Lurch driving it.  Yeah.  He's too giant for that.  He really is.  I haven't been in a car that low to the ground in years.  It's so weird.  I have my own car.  Yeah, when you get used to the SUVs.  Yeah, yeah.  I haven't, I've had SUVs for the last, I don't know, at this point, probably 15 years.  Mm-hmm.  Every once in a while I'm in a car low to the ground.  That's fucking creepy.  Yeah, I got the Mustang, so it's not as, like, alien to me.  Yeah.  But if I get in a car that's really small, like, even the Mustang isn't a tiny car. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  But that gets, like, weird.  Mm-hmm.  You just feel like, and only in nice weather.  So if it's, like, snowing out and I'm in a car, I don't like that at all.  Mm, no.  I'd rather be in a fucking SUV.  I'd like to be a little higher up.  Yes.  A little higher up would be nice.  Yes.  Nice.  Kenny in his tiny car.  I'm like, you want me to upgrade your car?  What do you need?  I'll help you out here.  No, the insurance company allots me this. 
[00:12:30]  That's what he said.  He goes, yeah.  They only give me $30 a day allotment.  Allotment.  So this is it.  But, you know, it's a 2013.  Has 5,000 miles on it.  I'll make do for two weeks.  I'm like, dude, let's upgrade your car.  I'll make do for my entire life.  That's what Kenny does.  He makes do.  I bet.  As soon as I get in the car, he goes,  I just got to tell you, that accident yesterday was my fault. 
[00:13:00]  Oh.  Because he's feeling all bad.  The fact is, it's not.  So if the insurance idiots are listening, it wasn't his fault.  It's not his fault.  But he's, you know, we all know Kenny.  I got to tell you, G.A., she was my fault.  So we went to the scene of the accident.  Oh.  And then I'm like, look.  Returning to the scene.  It's two.  Because he goes, I think it's only one lane officially.  I'm like, no, it's two lanes.  Two lanes.  And certainly we got there, and it's very obvious it's two lanes.  And the tour bus got lazy, and he was a little bit in Kenny's lane.  So when he made that, he had to make that slight right. 
[00:13:30]  You know, there's not enough room.  Oh, was it a tour bus?  Was it one of those?  It was a tour bus.  Oh, I fucking knew.  Not a city tour bus.  One of these coming into town buses.  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  Okay.  I believe, yeah.  I don't think it was a city bus.  Now, Kenny was going to go straight.  What?  Kenny was going to go straight, and this guy was turning right?  No.  I don't really get what happened there.  It's a weird right.  It's a circle.  It's a central park south.  It's a circle.  So you go around the circle, and then eventually you've got to kind of, like, straighten it out 
[00:14:00]  now and go straight.  So it's a slight right for both people.  Okay.  So both lanes have to slightly go right.  Why couldn't Kenny go slightly right when the bus went slightly right?  He did.  That's what I'm saying.  And the guy, the guy had to go in Kenny's lane to fuck him up.  Well, obviously, yeah, yeah.  He had to.  And Kenny sort of knew he was in a weird spot, so he was looking to see.  He was trying to jump the light, and he blew it.  The bus got, you know, started out before he did. 
[00:14:30]  What if he, Kenny, pulled up by the door of the bus so the guy could have looked and seen  there was a car there?  Yeah.  But we've been, yeah, but we, yeah.  But, I mean, we've been in that situation a million times.  He's been, I told him this morning, I'm like, don't beat yourself up.  We've been next to huge trucks, but we've been next to everything, and nothing has happened  like that.  You know what Kenny is right now?  Where?  Gassing up my truck.  Nice.  You barely made it?  Be careful, Kenny.  Why? 
[00:15:00]  What happened?  Nothing.  You know, Kenny's got a bad rip now.  Yeah.  Don't back at anything called Clancy Kenny fucking running into the gas tankers.  Driving into the gas pumps.  Yeah, exactly.  I buy signal, but it didn't move.  But it's a building, Kenny.  I was hit by the gas pump.  But anyways, he pretty much told me the whole process that he has to go through.  I'm like, yeah, that's what we all do when we are in fender benders.  But he's explaining it step by step, like I was from some foreign country or something. 
[00:15:30]  Then the adjuster has 48 hours.  Then I have to take it to the body shop.  He's good.  I know him.  He does a good job.  I'm like, this is something we all know.  Hey, just God bless everyone walked away okay.  Am I right or wrong?  A hundred percent.  You know, from your lips to God's ears.  You know what I care about?  Getting to work, getting home, seeing the fam.  You do what you got to do.  Why would you set him up for that?  Because it's all I do now at home.  You do a lot of regular.  I constantly do regular Joe at home now.  I hate it. 
[00:16:00]  I annoy me doing it.  I annoy me doing it.  That's what I'm talking about.  Oh, it's just he's so fucking annoying of the character.  He's a teased spot.  Yeah.  Got a message for you, Anthony, from one of your, from one of, well, from someone.  Fan man from some flounder.  Trying to figure out how to set this up.  From someone you admire.  Oh.  Wow.  From someone you admire.  David Duke.  Yes.  David Duke.  What did he say?  We're serving chocolate in the bunker if you'd like to make it over. 
[00:16:30]  Get it?  I work for a rental car company.  I could tell you how to get a larger car.  Oh, boy.  And then, that guy's full of shit.  You can't get a larger car that way.  So you have to just pay for it?  Yeah.  There's probably a way to upgrade, though.  I mean, if they're giving you the $30 a day, but the bigger car is $50 a day, then I would  imagine you're paying the difference to being a nicer ride.  Right.  Is it as simple as that?  Let's see real fast.  Rick in New Hampshire.  Hey, Rick. 
[00:17:00]  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, so, yes, what you just said, if you stick with your own insurance company and they  only allow you a certain amount, you would have to pay the difference.  However, if it's the other person's fault and you go through their insurance, they have  to give you a comparable-sized vehicle.  Oh.  Sounds complicated.  It sounds a little complicated.  And plus, how do you know whose fault it is?  Yeah, we don't know whose fault it is, really.  Your fault hasn't been determined.  Right.  Okay, well, it's the insurance company that's determined that, so if you just give them 
[00:17:30]  the insurance company information for the other parts.  Maybe in New Hampshire, that's how it works.  Not here.  And the Big Apple.  NYC.  That's right, the Big Apple.  Mm-hmm.  Big Apple.  Did you see the Katja documentary?  No.  It's pretty good.  Is it?  Yeah.  Wasn't bad.  I don't see that one.  Wasn't bad.  You get to see New York all gritty and shit.  Like that gritty New York.  I love seeing New York all gritty and shit.  And the way things are going, I think we might get to see it again.  Yeah, we'll get back to that.  What the fuck is going on out there? 
[00:18:00]  Detroit's declaring bankruptcy?  Yes.  One by one, these cities are fucking going down.  They're falling.  We're going toward the sequester.  Oh, my goodness.  The sequester.  But meanwhile...  They can't figure this shit out.  $60 million was just given to Syrian opposition.  I don't give a fuck what they do in Syria.  That's $60 million pumping into Detroit or another American city.  I don't want to give that money to fucking...  I don't care what's happening in Syria.  Until we got our own shit figured out, I agree with you, Jimmy. 
[00:18:30]  I understand that it's important that we give some of these countries money.  Egypt still is giving money, too.  But until we figure our own shit out, why are we helping other places out?  We got cities going bankrupt left and right now.  I don't understand why we have to fucking give money away when we're broke.  $60 million could go a long way in this country for certain things.  They're trying to fucking get more money out of the taxpayers.  More fucking money they want.  The Democrats and Obama want more fucking money from the taxpayers instead of concentrating on spending cuts. 
[00:19:00]  It's astounding to me.  That's what drives you crazy.  I wouldn't mind if they took $60 million more and they were going to rebuild infrastructure in Detroit and put people to work.  Because the auto industry has taken such a beating.  Yeah, but they came back pretty strong.  They're doing all right now.  But that's not enough to save Detroit at this moment in time.  I'm more frustrated that these idiots down in Washington just can't work together.  They don't want to work together.  Because if they do work with the other side, like we were talking before the show, 
[00:19:30]  then the next campaign, that comes out.  Like, this guy was working with the enemy, so fuck him.  What did you say?  They're all crooks.  No, you said it perfectly.  They're all trying to stay under the radar.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're perpetually campaigning.  Politicians, their whole job is to stay under the fucking radar between elections.  Don't cross the boat.  Yeah, no one wants to work with the other side of the aisle. 
[00:20:00]  Why would you?  Because then you're up for re-election, and then even your own party, the guy that wants  to run against you in your own party will turn around and go, he sided with this Democrat.  Right.  And the Democrats do the same thing.  Do you want a man that signed a bill that said...  Right.  So they don't do anything with each other.  They sit there like they're on eggshells.  They freeze for their entire term, and then hopefully get re-elected again based on their  name, not anything they did. 
[00:20:30]  It's become a fucking battle.  I know everyone has their party.  I understand that.  But I think the bigger fucking story here is they just don't know how to work together  anymore.  They don't work together.  It's disgusting.  And the guy at the head of the fucking line...  And then someone will go, well, the reason is because the Democrats, and then the Democrats,  well, the reason is because the Republicans...  It's both sides.  But they've got to figure out a way to work together in the end.  But also, the president is supposed to have some kind of leadership qualities and bring 
[00:21:00]  these people together, whether it's through some kind of nice talk or wrapping their heads  together.  Right.  He's supposed to be the guy that gets past these impasses, you know?  He's the leader that is supposed to make this work.  I have never seen the government more divided than it's been under this president.  I think it's just showing how broke the system is, though, in general as well.  I mean, you can blame Obama's leadership qualities, and I'm sure... 
[00:21:30]  Horrible.  I'm sure you got a point there.  I'm not even going to say you don't.  But I think it also shows that the system is in trouble.  Yeah.  I really believe that.  You know, we'll find out when the Republican gets in next.  Well, yeah.  That a lot of this shit won't change.  If the Republicans...  I mean, they did a good candidate.  Oh, there's a big F. You're right.  Yeah, but we were talking about that just before the show.  They're already trying to find another candidate instead of fucking govern.  They're getting together where?  New York?  Yeah, New York now.  They're, you know, they're coming for fundraisers. 
[00:22:00]  They're coming to New York to try to figure out, you know, their guy already.  The Republicans?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  When there's shit going on in Washington, they got to figure out.  They're going to, yeah, come here.  And then, of course, they're saying anybody that voted against Sandy Relief should stay  the fuck away and not come to New York to try to get any money.  Well, you know what?  There's your $60 million.  We were all kind of figuring out the $60 million thing.  They voted against helping out those people.  Yeah.  But then Syria, they ship fucking money over there so the savages could blow each other 
[00:22:30]  up.  Who cares?  $60 million locally in New York, you know, we'll take it.  Yeah.  There's some people really hurting out there.  I know they pork barrel all this stuff.  I know they throw all this bullshit, but that Banner's a cunt.  John Banner is a cunt.  Well, I hope that cunt sticks to his guns and doesn't cave in to fucking Obama this time  about taxes.  No new fucking revenue in this deal.  If they want to avert this stupid fucking sequester, no new revenue.  Cut shit.  Cut it, you motherfuckers. 
[00:23:00]  Cut, cut, cut.  Cut, cut, cut.  Cut, cut, cut.  Exactly.  Where were we?  Oh, well, you got someone you admire has a message for you.  A message for me.  You want to guess who the admirer is?  Is it for me, me?  Or is it like...  Yeah, I'm saying this is all about you right now.  Like personal.  Huh?  To me, personally.  Personal to you.  Does this person say my name?  Yes.  Really?  If it's who I think it is, no way.  Nope.  It's not.  Fuck. 
[00:23:30]  What?  I just like the chemistry you guys have.  We have really good chemistry.  Is it who I think it is?  Nope.  I'm getting very excited.  Nope.  It's someone I admire.  Someone you admire.  But not that person.  It's not.  Nope.  It's not Tom Skerritt?  Oh, I know who it is.  Ah, Sam, I told you I have...  We fucking read each other's minds.  I love that.  I know who it is.  You were right.  Because you were scared that I was wrong, but I'm fucking right, am I?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:24:00]  It's not Tom Skerritt.  Damn it!  And I knew that would be who he was thinking.  Yeah.  Thus, then, why the brilliant chemistry?  Exactly.  You try to get that with Bob Kelly.  Or the who kid.  Right.  Or both.  Oh, damn.  Did you shout it out?  I know who it is.  Oh, who?  I mean, I'm not privy to it, but I just know.  Well, no.  I want it to be a surprise.  Okay.  Because that's why, even though you...  But you knew I wasn't going to pick who it was, because I was going to say Tom Skerritt.  But there was a very good chance you could have picked who it was.  Oh. 
[00:24:30]  Very good chance.  Because it's not out of the blue.  Mm-hmm.  But I knew you would go Tom Skerritt.  I'm not looking.  I'm not looking.  All right.  Ready?  Yeah.  Are you ready?  All right.  I'm ready.  Hi, this is Olympic gold medalist Mikayla Maroney.  I know Anthony is a big fan of my selfies.  I'll have to take one just for you.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Oh, boy.  How creepy is that?  That's going to be part of the trial of Anthony Comey.  A friendly message turned deadly. 
[00:25:00]  God, she talked to me.  I heard her all through the radio.  Her fans are going to be pissed.  Yeah, they fucking are very...  Her fans have been attacking you.  Very possessive of her.  We got a little more.  What?  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Hey, this is Olympic gold medalist Mikayla Maroney.  Thank you, Anthony, for the sweet birthday wishes on Twitter.  I marked them as a favorite.  And then, of course, I had to block you.  That's funny.  I did wish her a happy 17th.  Yes, you did, which caused a bit of a stir out there. 
[00:25:30]  It was a bit of a stir.  In the Twitterverse.  Mm.  Wow, that's pretty good.  How did that come about?  Anyone?  Bueller?  Comment?  Iraq?  Iraq, comment.  And I mean it this time.  Wow.  I know.  Yeah, she showed up yesterday.  Yes.  And we waited for a very long time.  Ooh.  And we were excited.  I bet.  And then we had to lie as to who you were.  Oh, really?  Well, maybe not really.  Lie as in not telling her exactly who you were. 
[00:26:00]  Peace on up.  Why?  Because there was no way we were going to take the chance to have this ruined.  Sure.  That they would look it up.  If we mentioned the name or the show that they may be aware to.  Right.  So who did you say Anthony was?  I just said Anthony.  He works here at the company.  The company?  The company.  I'm one of the satellite techs.  I was ready to say I had a whole story that you were a sports broadcaster.  Ah.  What?  Didn't have to go there.  McKayla Bavone.  She was one of the satellite techs right here on my radio show. 
[00:26:30]  He works here at...  How great is it?  He works at the company.  The company.  What's that?  The CIA.  And this is for you.  Oh.  Let me see.  Wow.  That's nice.  Wait.  Look at that.  She's making the face?  Let me see.  No, she's just smiling.  We were expecting her to do so, but she was like, if you go to mood.  Very cute here.  She wasn't?  No, she was. 
[00:27:00]  How does she look in person?  That's very cute.  She's tiny, right?  She wasn't as bad as TV was making her look.  As bad as TV.  No, remember, we were looking.  Her body was all weird on TV.  She's very cute.  Look at that picture.  What's that one?  Uh-oh.  This is the sign that she was holding in the photo for you.  Oh.  She signed it.  Plus, she put on some lipstick and she kissed it for you.  Oh.  Oh.  I'm going to hang this in my basement.  Oh, my God.  How creepy is all this?  How old is she?  17. 
[00:27:30]  That's good.  That's good.  You hang that up.  Look at Jimmy.  You hang that up.  You know, 17 is completely illegal in New York State.  I don't mean nothing illegal.  It's just, in God's eyes, you're disgusting.  But it's a gold medal winner.  It is an Olympic gold medal winner, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Take away all of your filthy thoughts, Jim Norton.  That is true.  You know what?  And it's an Olympic gold medalist.  That's correct.  Oh, my God.  Am I going to have to tweet that and piss a lot of fucking people off? 
[00:28:00]  That's great.  Hey.  Wait till she finds out what she just did.  Oh, no.  I hope she finds out.  I'm lying to her.  The headline will go out in the serious paper monthly, fat kid fired.  Fat kid.  Birthday boy shit canned.  Well, thank you for that whole thing.  That's pretty cool right there.  I mean.  E-Rock's a good boy.  Yes, he is.  So what did you do for E-Rock's birthday?  Oh, E-Rock's birthday is coming up, right? 
[00:28:30]  Is it today?  It's tomorrow.  It's tomorrow.  Oh, all right.  Well, then we'll do it.  No, Roland keeps telling everybody it's different things.  I can figure something else.  Well, we'll do something for your birthday tomorrow.  You're going to leave at 930?  Leave at 930 in honor of your birthday.  That's good.  That is good.  And then we'll do something for your birthday tomorrow.  For you.  Yeah.  We'll leave early for you.  Oh, that's so nice.  Big E-Rock birthday show tomorrow?  Big E-Rock birthday show tomorrow.  Yeah, bash.  Yep.  Live at Poconuts.  Jimmy just.  I just.  Oh, my God.  You can't do the Harlem Shake on an airplane. 
[00:29:00]  What the hell is that about?  Yeah, that's too scary.  That looks like our plane ride of fucking Club Med.  That was a little crazy.  Those assholes.  Remember the fucking guy.  Have we told the Club Med story in a while?  That's pretty funny.  That's a good one.  But the FAA is not feeling it.  No, of course not.  Have we told the Club Med plane ride stories in a while?  The plane ride.  I sure don't remember much of that.  Remember the drunk asshole?  That was me. 
[00:29:30]  It wasn't you.  They got up in front of the plane and grabbed the.  This is when you could still do shit.  Because, yeah, it was before 9-11.  Grabbed the fucking walkie-talkie thingy.  Yeah, the intercom.  The intercom.  And announced to the plane he was buying a drink for everyone.  Do you remember that guy?  Yep.  Yeah, that's a fun plane.  That was that charter plane.  And you know what?  And they were cool with it.  They allowed it to happen.  So then they went down the aisle and said, well, this guy's buying.  What do you want?  And he bought a fucking round for the entire plane.  That man?  Mohamed Atta. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  It was amazing.  Wow.  Amazing.  One big setup.  It was very nice to have on the plane that day.  I have a new character called Upbeat Producer.  Guys!  I have an idea.  I have an idea.  Let's do a video where the whole gang does the Harlem Shake, and we'll release it.  It will go viral.  How many radio stations did that?  I don't know.  A lot.  I bet a lot.  A lot.  They did, right?  Yeah, there's like a hundred of those that go up a day. 
[00:30:30]  To this day, even.  I mean, it's over now.  It's over, but people are still putting them up there.  But it better be unbelievably stellar if you're putting something up now.  Like crazy.  Right.  Like fucking Congress doing it.  Yeah.  Ugh, Jimmy.  What?  You just fucking farted.  Nobody's so prejudiced against me.  Did you?  Or is it the eggs?  The eggs.  No, you farted.  It's the eggs.  The eggs smell like farts.  The eggs always smell like farts.  People always think you fart when you're eating eggs.  The eggs are sealed.  Huh?  The eggs are sealed.  It was farts. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, I know.  The containers haven't even been opened.  That's how eggy they are.  Unlike your ass.  That's how eggy they are?  They're very eggy.  The big YouTube video today is the helicopter using the rotor wash to push the deer off of  the ice.  That's pretty brilliant.  Wow.  Where was that?  You can't see it because the fucking...  Yeah, yeah, because they got the big fucking stupid ticker on the bottom.  Getting creative with CNN in the way.  Oh, you know what?  I was thinking about you, Jimmy.  Why?  Did you guys see the...  Thank you, Kenny.  That is a cool video, by the way. 
[00:31:30]  Do we know where that was?  Somewhere cold.  Yeah.  On a lake and all that.  A lake.  I love going on fucking frozen lakes, by the way.  Somewhere cold?  I think it was a lake.  Love frozen lakes.  We don't get to see that shit around here.  No.  But you drive a little north of here in the winter, you get to go on a frozen lake.  They're awesome.  They really are.  It's fun.  I like the one from The Omen.  You know how Jimmy bitches about all the shit on the screen, especially on CNN?  Mm-hmm.  Did you guys see the trick basketball shot with the cheerleader who was doing the flip? 
[00:32:00]  And as she's flipping, she grabs the ball.  Flips it into the basket.  Flips it into the basket.  Yeah.  They set up this whole thing as a viral video when it was hot.  Obviously, everyone knows it now.  And then they sit back and are like, enjoy.  Enjoy this amazing shot.  And because of the graphics, you never get to see her pick up the ball or anything.  That's a perfect example of what Jimmy's talking about.  It's lazy.  She does this amazing, you know, the amazing gymnast flip or whatever.  You can't see her hands, her head. 
[00:32:30]  You can't even see her shoulders.  And then next thing you know, she's kind of, you know, right side up as she's, you know, throwing the ball.  The most important part of the video is covered up with their dumb graphic.  Right.  The most important part, how the fuck did she get the ball off the ground as she's doing this flip thing?  And it's dumb, lazy TV producers who aren't seeing this and stopping it.  Right.  You'd never see that.  But it's got to go higher up than that, where the CNN people got to go, look, it's so obvious.  A lot of times we fuck ourselves with all our graphics.  So we got to have a system in place where we can knock out the graphics for a second or pop them in the corner or something. 
[00:33:00]  Someone should have one button that they hit.  Right.  Someone that has to monitor what's on screen constantly and just hits the button and wipes every graphic off.  Yeah.  It puts a little, I'm sorry, a little, you know, there's little ones they put that are kind of transparent up in the corner.  A bug.  When you hit, yeah, when you hit one, you hit the one button and that just appears.  They could even do it just, they could keep everything where it's at.  At least you could see through the graphics for a second.  Yes.  I don't know why they're still doing that. 
[00:33:30]  Because they're lazy, dude.  It's all, they wonder why the internet, most people watching the news on the internet now, because they're fucking lazy.  I know a lot of the people we've talked to don't give a fuck about golf, but I love watching the PGA.  Oh my God, that's the worst.  That's the worst.  You know, they try to do golf highlights on CNN, it's like.  The cup is always at the bottom of the screen.  I'll just take your word for it, I guess.  Yeah, yeah.  That that was amazing, because guess what?  An amazing putt.  I saw the putter go, you know, back as he's about to stroke the ball, and that was it.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, I saw a couple guys jumping up and down. 
[00:34:00]  I never saw the ball roll toward the hole.  And with golf, it's always that way.  Like, they've filmed or shot golf that way constantly.  But the cup is always at the bottom of the screen.  Right.  And they show the shot.  How do you not know you're going to block the whole fucking thing with your dumb graphic?  I guess Jimmy's right.  They're just lazy.  They don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  So stupid.  Retarded.  It's especially stupid in this day and age when you could go to yourself, you know what?  Fuck that.  I'll just go online and watch it myself. 
[00:34:30]  I don't need you.  That's all I do.  You don't want your viewers to go, I don't need you.  Everything is scrolling and busy.  How much fucking visual entertainment do we need?  More colors.  But that's really what it is.  More moving stuff.  Quick.  The stock market ticker should be rolling.  Yeah.  Because everybody doesn't have that on their phone.  Let it be rolling.  Let the chyron that says either Fox or CNN or MSNBC spin in a slow circle so people become  hypnotized by it spinning. 
[00:35:00]  And then let this roll.  Fuck you.  Stop it.  But when they show like an old newscast, you feel kind of empty inside.  There's nothing going on.  You don't like the desk and the clock.  And then when they put a graphic on the screen.  It's all loud.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do remember those.  But they don't move it.  How much do you need on Fox Business?  Look at that.  Well, it is business though, Jimmy.  That's a little different.  But look at the one below it.  What's that?  It's CNBC.  Look at that Euro thing ticker. 
[00:35:30]  Go with regular Fox for real.  Because the business channels are different because they know a lot of people just have  that in their office and they're just looking at the ticker.  It says Fox News Live on the left.  Coming to compromise.  But the live has to spin a little bit.  The live spins and then occasionally shows the time.  Right.  And then there's the big fucking graphic that shows what's on the screen.  It tells you what's on the screen.  That Nick Raygon is a presidential historian.  Right.  And the sequester versus shutdown.  Right. 
[00:36:00]  And then you've got to have the graphic of the show you're watching.  Fox and Friends.  Fox and Friends.  And then you've got the ticker at the bottom with all the news that they're actually talking about.  And then they just throw in like extra stuff if need be.  It's absolute noise and nonsense and they do it reasonlessly.  Yeah.  Like if you're watching these guys just talking and you're above the suit jacket, that's fine.  But that's a great idea to push it and have it just be clear.  Empty screen.  Empty.  Something to be said for an empty screen when you're showing a video.  Because you want to fucking see the video. 
[00:36:30]  Well, that would be too much.  But they want credit for it.  At least, yeah.  Yeah, they want to have the credit for it.  So at least, like, you know, knock out a bunch of that.  But why are we even talking about it?  They're not going to change because of us.  They're not going to change it.  And who cares?  Because, like I said, any video they do show, I've seen it already days before.  MSNBC is even worse.  Look at that.  Yeah.  What is that?  They've got Morning Joe at the top.  Live in the middle.  March 1st.  Like, we need to know what day it is.  Lean forward.  Lean forward.  MSNBC.  3.49 Pacific time.  Picture in picture.  Picture in picture.  CPAC snub over there. 
[00:37:00]  MSNBC graphic again.  They have two MSNBC graphics on the screen at the same time.  Washington, D.C., New York missing from the guest list.  CPAC leaves Governor Christie out.  Then another scroller at the bottom.  They're into talking about politics.  How many different things they have?  It's very busy.  They think you're getting more information that way.  It's horrendous.  It's like, look how important this is.  They're trying to compete with the phones and the computers.  It's not worth the luck.  I don't mind as much as far as this.  But when they start showing highlights and stuff, that's when you've got to fucking knock it off. 
[00:37:30]  It's terrible.  Enough.  You know what I'm digging, working with on one computer I got at home?  Because I got big, one of those touchscreen things.  Tropico.  From HP.  One of the casinos sent it to me.  Tropico?  No, no, no.  It's a big, like, fucking monitor.  You know, your regular size, like, desktop monitor.  Whatever.  Fucking 20 inch or something like that.  And it's touchscreen.  Oh, wow.  And Windows, fucking Windows 8.  Windows 8 for a touchscreen, it's pretty fucking good. 
[00:38:00]  You set up all your little fucking cubie things on the screen with all your little things.  So if you want to use Twitter, boom, you just hit that fucking thing.  Wow.  You want to check the stocks, boom, you hit that.  And it's like, it really is a pretty good interface now.  With a mouse, though, it would stink.  Like, I couldn't imagine using a mouse on the fucking thing.  But with that, like, all those little cubie things, I'm kind of digging it.  But you kind of lean too forward.  What?  You kind of...  No, it's on my, it's actually in my kitchen. 
[00:38:30]  Like, it's kind of the spare kind of computer I use for security cameras and other shit.  I could see if it's a typical desktop with a, you know, you got a nice fucking little room in your house with a desk.  It would be a pain in the ass to kind of stretch forward a little bit after a while.  Yeah, yeah, that would kind of be weird, I think.  Well, you'd probably put it to the side, so you kind of turn and it's right there, maybe.  I don't know.  But the Windows 8 seems to be a better interface for touchscreen than it would be for mouse and keyboard anymore.  So, I don't know.  Something going on.  Apple's going away.  It's obvious. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's done.  Yeah, Apple's going away.  Give it another year.  It's pretty much done.  It's done.  It's done.  They had their run.  I wonder what they're working on.  I'm hoping it's not that dumb.  I'll tell you right now, this fucking phone that I, this fucking Samsung, I see everywhere now.  Yeah, yeah.  I hope that Apple went into a different direction.  When they saw the other phones catching up and they realized, well, we can only do so much.  I'm hoping that they just said, fuck it, let's concentrate on Apple TV.  Right.  For stock prices.  I hope they do.  Because if this cunting watch comes out. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, boy.  A what?  That cunting watch.  That dumb watch.  Bob Kelly thinks everybody will use it, but he's wrong because a watch is something that  you don't really, it's an accessory piece.  It's different.  Yeah, but we also said the iPad was stupid when Bobby brought it to our attention.  No, but I understand.  And that was new technology.  Yeah.  The watch is something that people have been wearing for centuries and people don't like  wearing it if they don't have to.  And most people have a watch.  Dude, give me the watch.  I put it up my ass.  I have this uncomfortable piece of metal in my ass.  Dude. 
[00:40:00]  I throw on a nice watch every once in a while for an accessory.  Yeah.  But the time's never right.  Oh, really?  No, I just throw it on.  But if you had a Rolex or a Breitling, you wouldn't take it off and put the iPhone watch  on?  No.  Oh, look, my apps are on my watch.  I know.  It's just fucking...  It's not going to work.  Apple better have some grand news soon because their stock price is fucking...  It's shit now. 
[00:40:30]  What the hell did it go down to?  They are now sitting at $441.40 from a high of over $700 a share.  Jeez.  Um, just, uh...  Yeah, just like a couple of months ago.  Going into December, something like that.  I mean, they're working on something like the elbow touch.  Where now you can touch your apple, but it's only your elbow.  You'd think there would be panic at CES?  Oh, my God.  The guy came out and said, we're going with the elbow touch. 
[00:41:00]  Elbow touch.  The elbow touch.  Holy shit.  Oh, no.  Oh, funny.  That, uh, Steve Jobs sure proved his worth.  Yep.  Uh...  Tim Cook, not so much?  He's a cunt.  No.  Nope.  All right, we're going to break.  This is E-Rock's birthday.  Aw.  Roland better be setting up something nice if he's been pushing this, uh, birthday thing.  He's been pushing it like crazy.  So he better come in here with something nice for E-Rock.  Right.  He seems...  Even if it's self-serving and something really nice for Roland that E-Rock could partake in. 
[00:41:30]  I mean, he's talking about sandwiches.  He's talking about a lot of different stuff.  Sandwiches.  Tomorrow we'll have sandwiches.  Sandwiches.  All right.  All right.  We'll see.  All right.  We got, uh, Donald Trump Jr. coming in today.  What is he promoting?  More Celebrity Apprentice?  Celebrity Apprentice.  I really, really liked the Donald Trump call yesterday.  That was fun.  And then people like, you know, because they don't believe, um, with him politically how to  be all...  Oh, yeah.  ...all douchey about my tweet yesterday. 
[00:42:00]  I don't, I don't, I don't agree with him politically, but I, I, I know when I'm hearing  some fun shit, people...  He was hilarious yesterday.  I know.  It doesn't matter.  He says stuff that he knows people are going to disagree with.  Of course.  That's why he says it.  He's the perfect heel.  Who said that after the show yesterday?  He's the perfect heel.  Yes.  Working everyone.  But he also, he also doesn't back off when he says something, which I kind of like.  No, no, man.  I respect that.  Yeah.  I loved it.  I would really enjoy arguing with him, I think, though. 
[00:42:30]  Because he's very argumentative.  Yeah.  He'd be fun to...  Yeah.  And he doesn't, he doesn't, I don't think he gets, he's not a baby about it when you  fight with him.  I think he can.  I think he's been in some tough negotiations over the years.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's got to have a thick skin, I believe.  I think he enjoys it.  Yeah, so we got Donald Trump Jr. coming in a little bit, and Eric's birthday, and now  this.  Hey, this is Olympic gold medalist Mikayla Maroney.  Thank you, Anthony, for the sweet birthday wishes on Twitter.  I marked them as a favorite, and then, of course, I had to block you. 
[00:43:00]  The Opian Anthony Show.  Opian Anthony.  The Opian Anthony Show.  The Opian Anthony Show. 
[00:43:30]  The Opian Anthony Show. 
[00:44:00]  The Opian Anthony Show.  I love, I love his voice.  I like Scott Weiland.  I like SDP.  Oh, yeah.  He had a lot of songs.  What was the song that Scott Weiland did?  I think it's a, it might be a, is it a solo song?  No, maybe it wasn't a solo song. 
[00:44:30]  Which one?  Ah, we've done this break.  Atlanta.  Oh.  It sounds kind of Jim Morrissey.  Jim Morrissey?  Yeah, I know you don't like Jim Morrison and the Dorts so much, but give me a taste of Atlanta.  Just because I'm thinking of it.  And then we'll give you the update on Scott Weiland.  Not the live version.  Oh, it's live version.  My God, man.  That's what they call him.  No, that was Sam.  Oh.  That was Sam.  It's solo.  That's what they call me.  Do you got Atlanta?  Oh, yeah.  Hold on.  I'm looking for his solo stuff. 
[00:45:00]  Oh.  Maybe it is solo.  It is solo.  Oh, all right.  I get confused.  Because when the guy is, like, the band, and then he does solo stuff, like, well, no,  that's just STP.  That's, yeah.  Different guitar guys.  With guys you won't notice that aren't playing.  Well, when you have such a unique vocalist.  Right.  We don't have it.  Really?  Whoa.  Son of a merch.  There it is.  No.  This next song. 
[00:45:30]  No.  I don't want to do it this way.  It's on our new album, number four.  It is STP.  But we actually really sort of came up.  Who cares?  We can't find the studio version of Atlanta by STP.  How about the one with the star up top?  Did you do that one?  What's that?  It's usually a studio version if it's a picture.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:46:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  She lives in the bungalow.  Oh.  This is definitely doors sounding.  What?  What?  You swear that this was some kind of lost track or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The new album.  It was all mine.  I love this song.  Oh.  It's painted with roses and balls.  Yeah.  He sounds very, uh, marzen.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You think he was influenced by the doors on that one? 
[00:46:30]  You know what?  I hate the doors.  I don't mind that song.  You kind of like it?  As much, yeah.  Well, I know you're a big Scott Weiland fan, so.  I like that.  I like Sour Girl.  That's a good song.  Sour Girl.  Sour Girl.  Give us some Sour Girl.  That's a good song right there.  I don't know that one.  Oh, you'll know it. 
[00:47:00]  Should we do this?  Oh, you'll know it.  Should we call it?  Should we call it?  Are we calling it?  Oh, no.  D-Rock, can we call it?  Oh, no.  S-T-P Day.  Yeah!  It's got the next pick, Sour Girl.  Oh, yeah.  I love this song even more than the last one.  I like this.  I like this.  I believe it's on the same album, too, right? 
[00:47:30]  Sour Girl the day that she left me.  Yeah.  Hey, what are you looking at?  Meow.  She was a happy girl the day that she left me.  Yeah, that's a good one.  She turned away.  What was she looking at?  I don't like that song.  Oh, you don't like this?  No, no, no.  Jimmy.  Sour Girl?  It's S-T-P Day.  Well, you've got to wait for the chorus. 
[00:48:00]  Okay.  Can't make a decision based on it.  Fair enough.  You go, that's a Sour Girl?  Yeah.  Nice harmony.  What would you do if I'd follow you?  Sounds very good.  Yeah?  I like it.  There you go.  Yeah.  I like it a lot.  I like it. 
[00:48:30]  It's a good one.  Can we do one bullhorn song before we move on?  Yeah!  Give us one bullhorn song.  You're picky, Rock.  Yeah!  You wouldn't sing to a bullhorn, right?  That's such a weird sound.  Sings into that bullhorn into the mic.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  Yeah, it's awesome.  Yeah!  Was Cracker Man a bullhorn song?  Oh, he sings into a bullhorn.  You don't like Scott Weiland?  No.  Just because of what happened in Boston, right?  I just think he's a self-centered, typical singer. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, yes.  But I think he's great.  I mean, he's a good singer.  We had two horrible experiences with the guy within, like, I think a couple days of each  other.  Maybe a week of each other.  Yeah.  We went all the way to Boston because we were told we'd interview STP.  It turns out we didn't because Scott Weiland didn't want to have anything to do with it.  And then me and Jimmy, I don't know where you were.  You weren't on the stage with us, right?  I wasn't?  I don't know.  No, I don't remember seeing it because I remember me and Jimmy being beyond annoyed 
[00:49:30]  because we're one of maybe six people on the stage, way off to the side, not bothering  anyone.  And they demanded that we leave the stage because Scott Weiland requested it.  He didn't want anyone on the stage.  I'm not saying on the stage where the people would see, like, way off to the side.  He's a douche.  He's a douche.  And then, of course, the PNC incident where, I don't know, he just, he was waiting for  the right time to leave his tour bus and you had the DeLeo brother there just screaming  and yelling at him, calling him Axl Rose. 
[00:50:00]  Me and Kenny saw that shit go down.  That was amazing.  That was a great night.  He was what?  Like an app?  Yeah.  I am smelling like a rose that somebody gave me on my birthday deathbed.  I am smelling like a rose that somebody gave me because I'm dead and bruised.  Let me sing that through the guitar pickup, though, or something.  Oh, that wasn't a Bullhorn song officially?  I don't remember. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Like yelling into a guitar pickup.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I am smelling like a rose that somebody gave me on my birthday deathbed.  This is pretty good.  Crack-A-Man's a Bullhorn song some of the times.  It is?  I am smelling like a rose that somebody gave me because I'm dead and bruised.  You could definitely change the sound, too, which I like.  What's the Cracker Barrel one?  Cracker Barrel.  No, Cracker Man. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's fun.  I remember saying that's live.  This is a Bullhorn song.  Rock.  Sam, comment?  Anything on STP?  No?  You don't believe it?  Not feeling it?  Not feeling it?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, fuck. 
[00:51:30]  I've got to break out my STP songs today.  Yeah, that's a good song right here.  Yeah, that's a good song right here.  Yeah, that's good.  Oh, man.  There's a Bullhorn.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  There's a cow's like it.  I can see it on that.  It's pretty sick.  Strip club music?  Yeah, it's okay.  Whatever.  Yeah, absolutely.  You can see it, definitely.  Whatever.  Some whore fucking writhing around on the pole.  Yeah.  Love that.  You're kind of shaking her pussy all over the darn place. 
[00:52:00]  Fat pussy.  Let's see.  Last we left you at STP, which was yesterday, they fired Scott Weiland, but now they've got  Scott Weiland on TMZ, and he has a lot to say here.  Uh-oh.  So let's play this for everybody.  I'm a huge fan.  Say hello to Doug Breon here, the lead guitar player in the Wild Bouts.  Is he going to be in the new STP?  Uh, no, STP's not broken up.  It's, uh, things that just try to, uh, boost ticket sales. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, it's a thing that they did to help us boost ticket sales.  That's great, because it's almost impossible to break the band up, or fire you in a way,  because you pretty much put the place together.  No one can, that no one is in the band.  So what is this they said?  What does that mean?  I have no idea.  I haven't talked to them for a while, uh, but, uh, they were trying to get shows put together,  and, uh, but we already had our tour.  So, you don't know what the reason was that they put that surprise statement out on you 
[00:53:00]  like that?  Well, they've done a lot of that stuff in the past before.  It's just kind of the way they roll.  Okay, because you've got a pretty stable career going, and a lot of people are just wondering.  You have a lot of fans, and some people were questioning, maybe it's because you're doing  a little drinking and stuff, which you pretty much cleaned up in comparison to most other  musicians.  Um, well, as far as that, I haven't been doing any of that stuff for a long time.  I drink some, yeah, but, you know, I don't think I'm fine. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, all good.  Awesome.  So, STP is still together, and you're leading it.  I started it.  That's right, man.  Jesus.  Was that in New York?  That sounds like a guy that I know doing the interview.  Really?  Is it the guy we know?  That's what I'm saying.  It sounds like him.  God, if it's him, then let's get him on the air.  If that's him, I don't know what he was even done.  Do we know?  I don't know, to be honest with you.  I know he likes to, he has a place in New York, I do know that. 
[00:54:00]  He comes here from time to time.  Wow, he's definitely not doing anything.  Look at him.  Look how much bigger he is.  He's obviously off the stuff.  He's almost unrecognizable as Scott Weiland there.  Wow.  He is definitely a little chubbier.  A little chubbier.  He looked like a skeleton there for a while.  I mean, I've heard things over the years, and we kind of saw it for ourselves a little bit.  Like, the band doesn't really talk to him.  He travels by himself on a bus, and the first time they see each other is pretty much on stage. 
[00:54:30]  And then they kind of go their own ways after the show's over.  It's like, they're just pretty much a business at this point.  He's walking through an airport, Jimmy.  So I don't know.  Oh, boy.  There's trees in the airport.  That's not New York.  We don't get trees in our airport.  Who's that with him?  That's his guitarist for another band he's doing.  Wow.  Got him in the airport, huh?  Right here.  I'm surprised.  I'm surprised he stopped.  No one can.  No one can.  So what is this they said? 
[00:55:00]  What does that mean?  I have no idea.  I haven't talked to them for a while, but they were trying to get shows put together.  But we are together.  I'm surprised he's talking.  And what's the new tour?  What's the name?  It's Purple to the Corridor.  Yeah, so we're doing songs of ours.  We're doing songs of STPs.  I think we're actually back there.  And, yeah, so it'll be cool.  You think this guy's like, fuck, this is great.  I got him.  You don't know what the reason was. 
[00:55:30]  You can tell he doesn't want to stop.  They've done a lot of that stuff in the past before.  I know exactly what's going on.  Yeah.  The band is all fucking pissed off because he's pretty much doing a solo thing where he's going to be singing STP songs.  STP.  So they probably turned around and said, well, we're firing him.  Okay.  You think?  Yeah.  Why would he do that?  What?  Like, what?  Does the band not?  Why would he just tour Stone Temple Pilots?  And why would you?  There's probably things he wants.  Yeah, there's other things a guy like Scott Weiland wants to do. 
[00:56:00]  So he goes off, does his solo thing, probably plays a few covers, a few STP songs, a few songs from other projects he's been in.  Or solo projects.  Yeah.  Right.  And other shit.  Maybe he wants to try something a little different, you know, that wouldn't fit the STP mold.  Yeah.  Okay.  So I think they're going to be in New York in April.  I want to, or Scott Weiland's new project there.  I want to check it out.  Hey, did they ever get, um...  He seems way cooler there, by the way, than what we've seen over the years.  Because he seems like he's pretty lucid. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, I forgot.  Oh, did they ever get a new singer for Velvet Revolver?  No, remember?  They stopped knowing?  No, they were, remember they were hinting, they were close to signing somebody, but man, we haven't heard about that in a while now, right?  Maybe they're all sick of it.  Yeah.  I know you guys aren't hockey fans, but Rick DiPietro, the Islander goalie.  Rick Double Penetration Pietro, what?  Oh, DiPietro, right.  The Islanders signed a 15-year contract with the guy, and he's been a complete boss. 
[00:57:00]  He's been injured a shitload.  And the Islanders finally, this year, kind of put him on waivers, and he's down in the minors.  Yeah.  Playing for their farm team.  Yeah.  And he basically talked about killing himself.  Really?  And now, because it's a big deal in the sports world, and especially in the hockey world, and with Islander fans, he's trying to say, oh, you know, I was just kind of...  Kidding?  Kind of saying some shit, I actually wouldn't really do it.  But no one's surprised, because this guy has had a nightmare of a career, even though he's making a ton of money. 
[00:57:30]  Who did he play with before?  Islanders.  Is it embarrassing for him to be fucking shipped down to minors?  Yeah.  He was supposed to be pretty much right up there as one of the best goalies in the league.  A lot of promise.  And then just injured over and over and over again.  And then, you know, rehabbing.  Like, he would miss a year here, six months here.  It was ridiculous.  How long has he been playing?  He's now 31 or 2, so...  And he started young.  He's probably been at it 10 years this far.  But hasn't seen a lot of time. 
[00:58:00]  He just gets injured all the fucking time.  I hate injury-prone athletes, and I know I shouldn't, but I do.  And I forgot how much the contract was originally, but it's a big nut.  15 years.  It's basically a lifetime contract they gave him.  And it has not paid off whatsoever for the Islanders.  Anyway, here's DiPietro talking.  DiPietro says he doesn't know what his future with the Islanders is now,  but he does know he's healthy for the first time in years. 
[00:58:30]  You know, there's three years there where you just...  Every time you go on a butterfly, it hurts.  Or every time you do something...  It sucks having a play like that.  It sucks having a, you know, warm-up for two hours before you go pray.  It just becomes...  It just becomes a hassle, you know.  And it's just not as fun as it should be.  And at one point, it nearly became too much for the $68 million goalie.  Between the injuries, the losing, and the wrath of the fans,  he thought about giving up and just quitting. 
[00:59:00]  And I'm not talking about hockey.  There's times where I've thought about driving my car into a tree,  off the Throgs Neck Bridge.  I mean, it's been a lot of dark times.  But DiPietro can still see light at the end of the tunnel.  After all, he's only 31 years old.  And while he's not the franchise goalie he hoped to be,  he still would like the chance to bring the franchise glory.  So...  So why is he backpedaling?  I mean, you know, it's 70...  He's making about...  I did the math quickly.  He's, what, $4.5 million a year for 15 straight years. 
[00:59:30]  That's a lot of fucking money.  That is a lot of fucking money.  I know it's about more than the money,  and the money is not going to stop you from being depressed,  but it's like...  Mm-hmm.  That's a lot of money.  Give me $4.5 million a year.  I won't be depressed.  I'll take $4.5 million forever.  Yeah.  Are you willing to take a pay cut?  Wait a second.  That's a lot of fucking money to be depressed about.  That's a lot of, and you guys can't see at home,  but I'm doing the thumb rubbing between my fingers.  I see that, Jimmy. 
[01:00:00]  You believe him?  You think he actually would have maybe drove off the Throgs Neck?  I don't know.  Or is it the Throgs Neck?  The Throgs Neck?  Yeah.  Why would he say it?  Unless...  When you were thinking it.  Yeah.  Because he followed up, but there was a lot of dark times.  Yeah, he must have thought it.  He must have been thinking.  Well, it's got to be frustrating.  I mean, it was extremely frustrating for the fans,  so I can't imagine how frustrating it is for the individual.  Like he said, he would have to warm up for two hours  just so he could go practice. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Imagine that.  Oh, is he pulling muscles?  Everything.  Everything.  Hips, knees, groins, you name it.  What's the butterfly?  Is that when they're in the goal  and they kind of go like left and right legs  splayed out different ways?  I would assume, yeah.  Something like that.  Oh, God.  It's not my love.  What happened?  Ralphie Mae.  What happened now?  He's going off on Twitter.  I thought we were fine.  I thought you guys squashed it.  We squashed everything.  He's going off on you?  But now he's fucking...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  He was on our show. 
[01:01:00]  We kind of smoothed things over.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Was there any flare-ups on your part?  Not.  I haven't said a word.  So what the fuck's going on?  I wonder if one of the fans started it.  It probably was a fan, but I mean, you know.  Yeah, because he says...  He says, I've turned them down twice.  Here's what I see from him first.  I've turned them down twice.  ONA would probably still be in jail, if not for me.  Oh, God, Ralphie.  You're welcome.  Why is he going with the same thing? 
[01:01:30]  I have no idea.  I mean, if he wants to play, I'll fucking play.  And then he says...  Because I've never had a problem with Ralphie Mae.  The fact is, we had an incident where things got really crazy, and there was a naked girl  outside our building crying.  Puking or something.  They came in drunk.  Yeah.  They might have had a little something in studio.  I don't know, to be totally honest with you.  So there was a situation, and Ralphie Mae swears he saved the show because someone that was  there to arrest everybody happened to be a fan of Ralphie Mae. 
[01:02:00]  But he wasn't there to arrest everybody.  A cop showed up because there was a chick puking on the sidewalk.  We made a lot of it because it was kind of fun to...  We made radio out of it, as it's called.  And it came in, and the cop recognized Ralphie.  They started talking, and everything was cool.  But the cop wasn't ready to do anything.  And we allowed Ralphie to kind of have his moment in the sunlight.  Because it didn't matter to us.  So we're like, yeah, Ralphie saved the show.  Yeah, but then he fucking liked taking it all seriously.  But he didn't save the show. 
[01:02:30]  We just kind of allowed that to be good radio.  So what is he doing?  This isn't that bad, what he said.  What?  Oh, my fault.  Which one?  This last one?  Oh, my fault.  The one where he goes, I turned them down twice?  He might have been...  Are you sure he's not answering a question?  Like, some guy might have said, did you ever turn them down?  He might have said, well, I turned them down.  He hasn't turned us down twice.  I turned down.  He says, I don't care.  But I did call when Anthony was being a cunt to me for no reason.  Fuck him calling me a cunt.  Saying I was a cunt to him.  Fuck him. 
[01:03:00]  He said, I turned them down twice.  Once when I got busted in Guam.  And once when they wanted me on with a comic I don't care for.  So there might have been...  Someone might have said, did you ever turn them down?  He might have been saying, well, these are the two times I didn't.  I have no recollection of Ralphie May turning our show down.  But I did call...  The fuck, Ralphie?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  For no reason.  For no reason.  No.  Shut up.  And we smoothed things over with that shit.  Enough with this guy.  He blew us off with Ryan Starr.  We were in the Billy Joel box. 
[01:03:30]  What?  Oh.  Oh, that's Scott Weiland.  Oh.  I just read a text from Rowling because I thought it meant something here.  Yeah, we went to see Ryan Starr and it was the night I was hanging out with Billy Joel.  Like, you know, I was good enough for Billy Joel, but we weren't good enough for Scott Weiland.  What happened?  It was out there in Huntington.  They treated me great.  And I happened to hang out with Billy Joel a little bit, for real, as we were watching  the Scott Weiland show with his daughter. 
[01:04:00]  He was so down to earth and nice to me.  And we had a little chit-chatting, nothing too crazy.  We were clinking our drinks together a little bit and he was joking and had a really good  time with Billy Joel.  He couldn't have been nicer.  Knew the show, knew of us because we know the same people out there on Long Island from  radio and stuff.  You know, Bob Buckman, if I have to get very personal.  Did Billy Joel go around saying he saved the show?  Did he do that?  Jesus.  What?  Well, and then...  Right.  And then the owner of the place that STP was playing at, like, takes us around and go 
[01:04:30]  say hi to, you know, STP.  And we got shut down at the door, the owner and everybody.  What the hell's that about?  When they were taking me back there, I'm like...  You knew.  I just knew.  You knew baby boy wouldn't see anybody.  I said, there's no fucking way we're meeting Scott Weiland or saying hi to Scott Weiland  tonight.  Wow.  But then, you know, five minutes later, I'm hanging out with Billy Joel.  He couldn't have been nicer.  It's like, really?  Billy Joel, you know, the guy that has sold fucking, I don't know, two and a half million 
[01:05:00]  records probably at this point.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know what Ralphie's doing.  You want to get him on the phone?  No, I don't want to get him on the phone.  I don't want to get him on the fucking show.  Fuck him.  I've had it with him.  I don't think...  Just fucking relax.  Do your fucking shit and stop commenting.  I will go on record and say that, Ralphie, you did not save our radio show.  We were in a spot, but we were going to be okay.  One of the cops that came by to kind of take a look at the situation knew you, and then 
[01:05:30]  we kind of went with the whole angle, like, yeah, Ralphie, save the show, because it didn't  matter to us.  The fact is, you did not save our radio show.  I appreciate what you did that day, and you talked to the guy and all that, but we weren't  even in trouble.  Trust me, if the, you know...  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  No, go ahead.  When did he say we'd be in jail if it wasn't for him?  Well, that's the day where he said he saved the show and saved us all from being arrested.  There's a tweet that he says that.  Oh, I think he said that.  Yeah, it wasn't even...  No, no, no.  That's not even close to true.  We were in a spot. 
[01:06:00]  We were in a spot that day.  We had naked girls.  One was naked.  It was fucking business.  People were going into the building for their jobs.  I used to put her on a table in what became the Ron and Faye's office.  28 minutes ago, he said that.  Oh, did he?  Okay.  He tweeted, I've turned them down twice.  ONA would probably still be in jail if not for me.  You're welcome.  He puts like, you're welcome.  Oh, I didn't see that.  I'm sorry, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm not accepting you're welcome because you did not save the show.  I'll say it again.  Fucking Ralphie.  I've had it with him. 
[01:06:30]  It made fun radio that day, so we went with the angle that you kind of saved us.  I'm sure you helped us a little bit, but you didn't save us.  Like, we don't bash fucking comics on this show.  I was being cunty to you for no reason.  I was doing a show.  We were having fun.  And I don't think...  Came up.  We were fucking bashing everybody.  And he takes it all fucking seriously.  And now that he's...  For you.  And then he's kind of bragging that he turned us down twice.  I have no recollection that he turned us down.  Believe me.  Okay?  He didn't. 
[01:07:00]  None.  None whatsoever.  A comic he didn't care for?  What?  I thought we kind of smoothed things over when it got a little weird there.  Oh, I've had it.  For Ralphie May, in my life, in any way, shape, or form, I've had it.  For this stupid tweets.  Needy fuck.  Shut up.  Had it with him.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break.  And then we're going to say hi to Donald Trump Jr. next.  Stay there.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:07:30]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah!  By the way, I know y'all is not SDP.  Don't you worry about it.  It's Days of the New Enemy.  Yeah!  It's just that same sound that I enjoy.  Days of the New?  I know our guys from Philly were Days of the New Enemy.  Enemy. 
[01:08:00]  Octane.  No.  Sang Enemy.  Does Days of the New also sing a song?  Oh, yeah.  I think they were just very good at doing that song on a bunch of other covers that we liked.  Yeah, we liked those guys, Octane.  Wait, they were doing a cover when they did Enemy?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the Days of the New song.  Yeah.  Wait, wait.  I think we're very confused here.  I don't.  Wait, what are you talking about?  Octane's Enemy is their song, right?  Oh, is there another Enemy song?  Yeah, Enemy was, what's his name? 
[01:08:30]  That band that was the Israeli guy, singer.  Well, they also had one that said Disturb.  Disturb.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What?  Enemy!  Oh, no, I know that one.  Yeah.  I'm going, yeah.  Oh, okay.  That's Enemy by Days of the New.  We're all confused.  Right?  Now I'm fucking confused, too.  No time.  No time to waste.  I got a lot of, I got a lot of anger.  It's not a lot of waste.  Not another time. 
[01:09:00]  They did the side side for us.  Where the hell was this?  On the walkover.  Because Rogan said, do something in the original.  Animals, enemies are the closest friends I keep.  All right, so we got that figured out.  Octane and the band out of Philly, who did a bunch of stuff with us over the years, they  had a song called Enemy.  Now go to Days of the New, Enemy.  There you go.  This one.  Yeah.  Okay, so we're both right so far.  Right.  And then we're at Disturbed Enemy.  Oh, yeah, let's make it, everyone's right. 
[01:09:30]  I bet you were all looking at each other like the other two are wrong, but now all three  of us are going to be right.  That's all I was thinking of was Disturbed Enemy.  Guys, that's case scenario as far as I'm concerned.  Everybody's right.  And then here's Anthony being right, Disturbed Enemy.  Yeah.  Because that's a popular song title.  Yeah.  That is so weird how that worked out.  Exactly.  Especially Jimmy's.  I thought I had them.  Yeah, no, I know.  I thought I came doing a cover of Days of the New, so I was wrong about that part. 
[01:10:00]  Everyone wins.  I thought it was Meg.  There's one thing I can talk about.  It's original covers.  I mean, original songs that we've had performed for us on 57th Street.  You must have really liked that song, because I forgot all about that.  Love it.  I actually got it on my daily iPod fucking rotation, whatever.  Right.  Old man way of saying it.  Hi, Donald.  We got Donald Trump Jr. in studio.  Yes.  I saw your tweet.  It's Donut Day or something after this?  Yeah, I had to come in a little bit earlier, because my son's Donut Day, and you know,  you've got to make your priorities.  Donut Day?  Yeah, I don't miss Donut Day.  What's Donut Day?  I don't know.  It's just a bunch of four-year-olds eating donuts and making their dads fat. 
[01:10:30]  Aw.  You know what my son decided was yesterday?  What's that?  His birthday.  And we just went with it.  Just go with it?  How great is that?  He decided it was because it was his Pop Pop's birthday down there in Philly.  Oh.  So we did a whole, like, you know, we had to do it on the fucking phone and stuff, but  man, you really feel like you're watching, like, a TV show.  It's my birthday, too.  We did the birthday phone call, but then we're eating dinner, and I go, hey, just leave the  phone on.  We'll just kind of eavesdrop into your world.  You can see what we're doing. 
[01:11:00]  That's cool.  It was kind of cool.  But somewhere in his little mind, he decided to make it his birthday because of that yesterday.  No, you know why?  So my wife went with it.  Birthdays are like, you know, that's a major celebration when you're four or five years old.  I mean, that's the end-all, be-all.  That's the big one.  No, he wrapped his own gifts and everything.  It was his birthday yesterday.  He decided.  Hey.  All this kids.  It's a madhouse.  It's kind of fun, though, because it was like, kind of made yesterday a little more fun  than usual.  Like, all right.  Yeah, no, my son would turn four this month, and yeah, he extended his birthday for like 
[01:11:30]  three days.  Yeah.  So it became a major celebration.  Right.  Yeah, so.  Not bad.  Yeah.  Donut day, though.  Why would he just start saying it's birthday on a random day?  I wonder who else does that.  Your kid's ripping me off.  Oh, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Jimmy only does that when he goes to, like, the, you know, the Japanese hibachi place.  He just tells them it's the birthday every time, so they bring him out the little, you  know.  Oh, we've all pulled that trick, man.  That's a very gentlemanly way of saying it, but I do it when I go to massage parlors. 
[01:12:00]  It's my birthday.  They give it a little extra for your birthday?  Yeah, you get extra fingers.  A little extra knuckle?  Yeah.  Jesus.  We've all done the dumb, hey, could you bring a dessert?  It's his birthday.  And he's surprised someone at the table.  Oh, where it's not the birthday.  We all think we're clever because we do this.  Oh, yeah, because everyone's birthday is that night.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're not that original, but you still think it's funny, and it goes along with it.  It's all embarrassing.  Yeah.  How many kids you have?  I got four.  Four?  Jesus.  Four.  Yeah, it's pretty ridiculous.  Wow.  What are the ages now? 
[01:12:30]  Almost six.  Right.  Just turned four.  Right.  Sixteen months and four months.  Wow.  Sixteen months and four months.  Yeah.  I know your last one is right behind ours.  Yeah, I'm right there with you.  Yeah, we're only a week or two apart on the last one.  Yeah, we're like late October.  You went sixteen months.  Wow.  They're a year apart?  Yeah.  I mean, we have four, five, and under, so it's pretty ridiculous.  I tell my wife I'm a little disappointed because it's been like four months since she's  been pregnant, and I'm just not used to that. 
[01:13:00]  She's actually thinking about another.  I think I'm done.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  I have no say in the matter whatsoever, as anyone who has a wife knows, because I'm  probably just not willing to go that next step to finalize it.  Right.  My end of that negotiation, so basically it's totally in her control.  I would imagine to have a little help around the house, Donald.  No, honestly, not much.  Not too much.  Not much.  Every once in a while, but we don't have any kind of full-time or live-in.  My wife's a machine.  She does it all.  Yeah, it's scary to trust other people.  Four kids. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, we don't like that, and she's very, very much like that, so this is what she wants  to do, and she loves it, and she does an amazing job with it, so it's great.  Me and my brother are barely a year apart.  That's just crazy.  Yeah.  No, yeah, my youngest and my second to youngest are 12 and a half months apart, so almost  Irish twins.  And then my other brother after that is 13 months from my other brother.  So my mom was like...  How about the mindset?  Just get it over with?  Get them out?  You know, they keep themselves busy.  It's a lot easier than once they get out of diapers and you go back into diapers, that's 
[01:14:00]  a big transition again.  So our theory was just get it out and be done with it.  I just never minded the diaper thing.  I thought that would be a big deal.  Really?  Yeah, I didn't mind it.  It wasn't big for you.  I don't do much of it because...  Oh, you're one of those guys.  No, no, no.  By the way, I have no issue with it.  I'm not that...  I used to think I'd be that guy.  But do you hand off the baby?  Or at that point, do you go, all right, I'll change it.  I thought women's work.  Go for the past.  All right.  You know, I'll do it. 
[01:14:30]  Again, I don't have any...  You know, once you...  When it's your kid, it's a whole lot different than what you think it's going to be.  Like, it's just not a big deal.  But I tend to just give it back.  And, you know, listen, I work a lot also.  So, you know, my wife's not one of those wives like some of my friends where I come home  after, like, a 15-hour day, and she's like, okay, well, I've been with the kids all day,  so now it's your turn.  Like, she recognizes that I was breaking my ass.  And, like, she's...  You know, so she does most of that.  I do want to state that other people's baby shit is horrendous.  But when it's your own, for some reason, something in your head, I guess, makes it a little easier. 
[01:15:00]  I don't know.  It's different.  But then you smell someone else's baby shit.  Oh, man, it's a nightmare.  Oh, good God.  It's a nightmare.  Good God.  Would you change a baby?  Never.  I wouldn't either, man.  No.  No.  Yeah, but you know what?  Every guy in there says that until they have a baby, and they talk so much crap.  But I was never going to change someone's baby.  And then, like, two minutes later, they're changing a baby.  I used to say that, by the way.  I was like, yeah, it's just not going to be my thing.  You know, we had our first.  And, like, literally 20 minutes later in the hospital, the nurse is like, you know, the baby made poo. 
[01:15:30]  Do you want to learn?  I'm like, my wife's like, go do it.  I'm like, okay.  Wow.  So I lasted about 15 minutes with my theory of I'm not going to change a baby.  My nephew is 18, and my sister just has another baby.  You're changing your nephew's 18-year-old diaper?  You're an 18-year-old.  It's a really weird thing.  He'll just wear it, but he wears it on his head.  And I'm like, you're doing it wrong.  And he just thinks it's funny.  It's just so much easier than going to the bathroom.  Yeah.  I can just go right here.  Like, why?  Yeah.  That's a big age difference.  18 and how old?  Five months.  Five months.  Six months.  So you're right behind. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  That one's right behind our babies.  It's really bizarre.  Like, why would you do that?  Now you've got to start all over.  Wow.  That is a nightmare, man.  I can't imagine that.  Yeah.  Like, you're ready to get them out of the house.  You're about to start your life over.  And it's like, here you go.  Because that's such a binary thing, man.  Once you flip that switch, like, you're there for 20 years.  It's not.  20-year investment.  Yeah.  The first few months is a nightmare.  See, my daughter's just becoming, I call it aware, where she's starting to, like, move  around and check things out.  She smiles. 
[01:16:30]  She recognizes you now, finally.  Yeah.  But the first few months, it's all just zombie, zombie land.  Yeah.  I'm not big into the first, even, like, year or two.  It's once they start being able to communicate.  I can't relate.  You're just not a nice guy.  No, no.  Listen, if you follow my Twitter feed, I'm always doing something with my kids.  But I need, like, I need some back and forth.  No, I'm surprised you're saying two years, to be honest with you.  Yeah.  Like, my son.  Maybe it's a little extreme, but, like, that's when they start.  Around 18 months is when I really start digging my son.  Okay, but, yeah, when they're starting to walk and do that kind of stuff, then you can 
[01:17:00]  start playing with them a lot better.  But that first year is painful, man.  I can't do it.  Yeah.  The first year was a little rough, but first four months especially for me.  But, like, now with my four, like, he, you know, he's like my little sidekick, man.  We just go everywhere together, you know, on the weekends and stuff.  So it's nice.  It's a lot different.  A little mini-me.  Oh, yeah.  You get to do any fly fishing, any hunting?  What are you at these days?  Ice fishing?  Season's over.  No, I'm not a big ice fisherman.  I mean, the idea of sitting there and just doing nothing.  Yeah, I need a little bit more active outdoor, you know, activity.  So season's going to start, you know, pretty soon, April 1st, basically. 
[01:17:30]  And I'll start hitting up or, you know, hitting upstate, like, Lake Ontario trips and stuff  on the weekend.  You know, get out there.  So, you know, I know you have the open invite up, so I'm just not going to keep going for  this because it's freaking embarrassing at this point.  Like, talking about, yeah, I feel like a jerk on it.  I have a kid like you.  I'll go with you.  I'll go with you.  And then he never calls.  I feel like I've been stood up.  It's not, you know, something.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm not going to pursue this.  If you want to pursue this, let me know.  Can I defend myself?  What are you doing?  He wanted to take me to Montana.  I can't just go off to Montana. 
[01:18:00]  I'd roll.  It would roll.  Absolutely.  Trust me, I want him to go.  You'd like it, too.  You know, go do some prairie dogging and, like, long-range shooting out there.  Oh, yeah, I'm not a big hunter.  I love shooting, but I'm not a big hunter.  Yeah, I can't shoot out of us.  I don't mind.  I'm not one of those guys that say that you shouldn't, either.  I just know I can't do it.  No one invites me to Montana.  No one invites me.  Oh, Jimmy.  Because you yelled and screamed how stupid fly fishing is.  It's true.  I'd still have to be invited.  So you can hate on us for a week.  That's going to be great.  I can't wait.  Thanks. 
[01:18:30]  And then I'm thinking, like, I was going to be last man in.  It's all his friends that he obviously has known forever, and I'm like, man, I would  look like the biggest fucking dork if I don't fit in.  You don't fit in.  By the way, if you wouldn't fit in, I probably wouldn't invite you, because I wouldn't do  that to you, because then I feel awkward about having, like, the one guy that's not fitting  in, and then, you know, since you're my friend, I got to deal with you.  Like, I don't want to do that crap.  We were brought up a little differently, sir.  I was brought up very poor.  Oh.  What's your point?  I don't know.  We might not fit in. 
[01:19:00]  I don't know.  I don't know how that works.  A lot of my friends are blue-collar guys, just because I was brought up not that way.  Like, I was still brought up with, like, a good understanding of the other side.  I'm really right.  My Eastern European grandparents, I mean, I've gone through this with you guys before.  I'm really just joking with you.  I know that you work your ass off and you've made your own way.  Let me explain Molly Ringwald in freedom.  She's afraid that she's going to go away with you and all the rich kids won't like her.  You know what?  Jimmy's right.  But, you know, honestly, like, my friends aren't necessarily, you know, of that demo. 
[01:19:30]  You know, I got a lot of, you know, blue-collar, you know, because of the hunting and fishing  and stuff like that.  You know, I'm sort of, you know, I know it's hard to believe, and, you know, I get it if  you think I'm, you know, exaggerating it, like, a lot, but I can fit in both sides of  the spectrum.  I can do redneck pretty well.  No, you've been in here enough that we know what you're all about.  Where in Ontario do you fish?  Well, not Ontario, but, like, basically Pulaski, New York, like Lake Ontario tribs for the  steelhead.  Oh, you go steelhead? 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Steelhead, they're nasty, man.  Yeah, they're fun to catch.  And just, you know, listen, just break up the ear.  One big head muscle, basically.  Yeah.  They'll give you a fight.  Yeah.  It's all about that tug.  You know, they pull.  Not like your kind of tug.  Oh, no.  Not the type with an apology.  Different kind of tug.  Really?  Jim got all excited when I said tug.  You saw him light up.  You don't need Visine and a lawyer?  You ever do tuna fishing?  I have.  I'm obsessed with that dumb show, Wicked Tuna. 
[01:20:30]  I have.  I think it's Nat Geo.  Yeah, I mean, not so much that guy.  I mean, I'll go chase him with a fly rod and stuff like that also, so.  Is that a long day, though?  It can be, man.  Some of that deep sea stuff is, you know, it can be great or it can be like standing  in a cold shower tearing up $100 bills, you know?  Really?  It can be.  Yeah, you're sitting there.  You know, some days are great.  I mean, I had a day this summer I was invited with a friend to go down to the Dominican Republic  and, you know, we caught, I think we went like seven for nine on Blue Marlin, which  is like unheard of in a day.  So, like, that was the most exciting day ever, but I was also with, like, a tournament  captain.  That's all he's done for 25 years. 
[01:21:00]  He was like, yeah, well, that was like the top three day of my entire career.  So, I was like, so basically there's zero chance I'll ever have something like that  again.  So, I basically retired from deep sea.  You should, yeah.  I'll do it with the fly rod and inshore stuff.  I can't wait to do a little more fly fishing.  I really do want to go back up there.  Like I said, man, just shoot me an email.  Really?  See?  Yeah.  But then I feel like it's an empty invite.  We have weird, like, you know, he's a real pain in the ass.  Like, I, I, no, I'm just being honest with you.  Like, six times, seven times or whatever.  And like, each time I'm like, no, seriously.  And like, listen, my free time is precious to me. 
[01:21:30]  Like, I work hard, but I play hard too.  And like, I would not sacrifice a weekend to babysit your ass if I didn't really want  you to be there.  Like, I'm not doing this for fun.  Like, I'm not one of those, like, false invite guys.  It's just not what I do.  Like, I probably should do stuff like that for business, but I just, life's too short to hang  out with people you don't actually want to hang out with.  This is what it's based on.  And we've had Quentin Tarantino in here.  He's like, next time you're out in L.A., man, look me up.  Love to, like, you know, have you over.  We'll do, you know, he does movie night or whatever. 
[01:22:00]  I'm like, that's awesome.  Never looked him up.  Because I don't know how to get a hold of him.  You didn't ask him for his email.  Fishing and outdoor stuff is different.  Like, it's a guy's thing.  You get together.  Like, it's not.  No, but we didn't exchange numbers.  Jerry Cantrell, I saw, he goes, hey, we should get together.  And I'm like, all right, yeah, if you want to, you text me later.  And he did.  He texted me later.  We went out.  And it was like, I don't really know him that well, but it was a genuine thing.  And I haven't seen him since.  Did you hang out?  Yeah, a couple years ago.  Well, I went out to L.A. and Greg Brady did the same thing. 
[01:22:30]  And we did exchange numbers.  So I'm out in L.A.  I go, hey, you sent a call when, you know, I'm here.  He goes, oh, great, come on up.  So I went way up into Bel Air, this ridiculous house overlooking, like, everything, literally  everything with an infinity pool.  It was an amazing spot.  Turns out it was his wife's money.  She was an international banker.  I thought it was Brady Bunch money.  That Branson, that Missouri show money that you're doing right now?  And he's the coolest guy.  You know, we've known each other a bunch of years.  And long story short, I brought a friend with me just because I felt uncomfortable just showing 
[01:23:00]  up at Greg Brady's house.  And I saw him and his wife having a conversation near the refrigerator because I kind of showed  up unexpected.  And I basically had Greg Brady's leftovers.  They were trying to figure out what they could serve me in the fucking refrigerator.  But we had a great, we really had a great night.  You should call in advance, like, a couple days.  Like, I'm going to be in L.A. on Tuesday.  Are you around?  I'm not that guy.  I'm last minute guy.  No, but I mean, that's how I do.  I never call last minute. 
[01:23:30]  I give them a couple days, and if they want to see me, they'll see me.  By the way, I used to be like that also, but I've sort of gotten over it.  And, like, sometimes when someone gives you that invite, even if you don't know them,  like, say, you know what?  Screw it.  Like, I'm going to put out that phone call.  I'll make the effort.  And honestly, I've made, like, a lot of great friends, like, people that are now, like,  very close friends that I probably would have never gotten to know had I just been afraid.  You know, you just got to pick up the phone sometimes.  You know, people are so afraid of kind of networking or whatever.  And it's, like, honestly, one of the best things you can do in life is just get over  that, like, fear of rejection. 
[01:24:00]  Like, honestly, what's the worst thing they can say?  Yeah, sorry, I can't do it.  Okay.  Yeah, no, I want to go to Montana, but my wife was pregnant at the time.  The kid was a little younger.  It was just a weird time.  So I think I'm finally out of the woods, and I could start doing some things again.  Well, it's a good time if you want to go.  We'll probably go again this year.  To Montana again.  Yeah.  Well, listen, we do it, like, because it's hard for me to take a week off also.  So we'll go out, like, you know, Wednesday night, fish Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday  morning, back on, you know, and just back, you know?  Do we get the power fishing?  Do we get the private plane on this one? 
[01:24:30]  No, man.  You know, if I'm not, if I'm not, if I'm not, DJT's not a big outdoorsman, and if I'm  not with DJT, I don't fly private.  Now, you've said that on our show.  You don't fly private, right?  Yeah, no, everyone assumes that.  They're like, oh, your travel schedule's not so bad because you're flying private.  I'm like, yeah, right.  I'm not even flying business class usually.  You fly coach?  Yeah, usually.  Wow.  You know, I sort of had a principle, you know, when I was young, it was sort of easy.  And then as I got older, you know, and even with work, it was sort of like, well, you're  flying sometimes with a whole team of younger guys, you know, for business. 
[01:25:00]  You know, I'm not flying them business class.  It's just, you know, wasteful.  But I have a hard time just myself being like, okay, even if I'm senior or whatever, like,  you know, putting them in the back and sitting in the front.  I was used to that, like, with my mom, like, you know, she'd be in first class.  I was like, that kind of sucks.  Sam, what's going on up there?  As we were kids.  And so, you know, I sort of had a policy.  If I'm going to make them do it, I'm going to do it myself.  And, you know, you're looking at three guys that absolutely agree with you.  What?  I have not sat in a coach seat in years. 
[01:25:30]  I would make my girlfriend sit and fucking coach if there was only one seat in the hospital.  We refused to fly coach to Cleveland.  Yeah.  Do you understand?  Yeah, I do a lot of international flights that way.  We refused.  They almost had to cancel the trip because we were being divas about it.  But, you know, it's just a, honestly, it's just a principal thing for me.  And I'm, like, just, whether it's, like, the Scottish half of me, I'm just naturally cheap.  I feel like a two-hour flight, six grand versus, like, 800 bucks.  I feel like an idiot.  Like, I'm just going to be reading a book anyway.  You know, you just feel stupid spending the money. 
[01:26:00]  And I can't help it.  It's just the way I was brought up.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Scottish people are known to be a little cheap?  That's what I hear, yeah.  Thrifty, yeah.  I don't know that.  Thrifty, whatever.  Oh, yeah.  Scotsman.  Really?  I've never heard that before.  Yeah.  Your dad was on the phone yesterday.  I heard that.  And I was like, oh, boy.  Because I've literally had one of those weeks where I've been going, like, eight till midnight  working on a deal.  Because it's one of those deals that if people leave and go their respective ways, like,  it'll never get done.  So, it's just kind of institute the lockdown policy.  So, I have no idea what's going on in the world in four days. 
[01:26:30]  But I saw on my Twitter feed that someone said he was on yesterday.  So, I was like, oh, boy.  Now, I'm going to get ambushed.  I have no idea what's coming.  It was great.  I know, based on history, that interview could go either way.  We got over that.  No, it was a misunderstanding.  I was coming back to the office later on.  He's like, yeah, you're fired for going on with those idiots.  He was hilarious.  He did say he would never go on our show again.  But we got past that.  Oh, come on.  We got past that a few years ago.  I'd like to think I smoothed over those waters.  He probably did.  Who knows?  It was a misunderstanding.  He's been in those situations with plenty of people over the years. 
[01:27:00]  You know, it happens.  I'd say there's some precedent for that.  He's a very dynamic personality.  Has he always talked his mind like that?  Like, he doesn't care, man.  Yeah, he doesn't care.  Well, you know what?  By the way, I think he's earned that, right?  No, I love it.  I absolutely love it.  And if everyone was honest with themselves, they would do it, and we'd be a better society  for them.  There's just so much caging.  And so many people won't say what they really think, so they act on sort of false actions.  It's just inefficient and a waste.  It's ridiculous.  I agree.  Do you ever win arguments with him when you were growing up? 
[01:27:30]  Because it seems that he's a very dominant, bright guy.  And if you're not attached to him, it doesn't really matter.  But when you're living in that world, it's probably difficult.  I mean...  It's actually a really good question, because I probably spent a lot of time in my life  trying to...  It's not my personality to sort of back down.  And I think in the grand scheme of things, some fights are worth having and others aren't.  And I probably spent a lot of my life having stupid fights just for the sake of winning.  You know, it's hard to win those battles.  And sometimes you just got to realize what it is.  And so, you know, working for him and with him, you know, sometimes it's difficult. 
[01:28:00]  But, you know, I think I used to try to prove a point, because I was working on a deal.  I knew whatever it was, and perhaps I had more information, but you're giving it to him.  And it's...  You know, you just don't do that in a group of 20 people, because he's not going to be  shut down in front of that.  In front of people, yeah.  At the same time, I'm not doing him a service as an employee.  You know, not telling him what I really think.  You just got to pick a time and a place, and you got to do it not in front of everyone  else, so he doesn't have to have that, no, no, no, I'm the big dog, this is how we're  going to do it, almost to, just to prove the point. 
[01:28:30]  So...  Right.  Don't ever go against the family in front of him.  Yeah, exactly.  No, but there's a lot of truth to it, you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, I think I probably did a lousy job of that growing up, and I've sort of figured it  out, and, you know, because of that, have just garnered a much better relationship,  and, you know...  Sure.  With it.  Well, this celebrity apprentice looks good.  Oh, yeah, it's good.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, the cast of All-Stars.  It's all the All-Stars.  Right.  Yeah, well, also what it is is everyone's been there, done that, so you don't have, like,  the first six-episode lull where people are trying to be nice, and they're just like, 
[01:29:00]  you know what, we've been...  Out for blood immediately.  Oh, they jump right in because they understand the game now.  Yeah, yeah, this is not their first rodeo.  They're just like, boom.  There's some good surprises early.  Pendula was in here recently.  He's a good friend of the show.  He said that the boardrooms are, like, two and a half hours long.  Sometimes longer.  Like, you don't see it in the show.  It's hard to translate it over, and, like, I wish they could do, like, an outtakes reel  because there's some shit that goes on in there that's...  It's just amazing.  The problem is it has no relevance towards what ends up happening in the end, so it's 
[01:29:30]  sort of...  With a limited amount of airtime, you've got to cut it.  Yeah, yeah.  But those things are intense, and they just go.  Like, they don't stop.  None of it's scripted.  It's just, like, you know, free-flowing crazy.  But I would love to see that.  There's got to be a place for that.  Online or something.  There's some stuff, like I said, there's...  I'd say 50% of the best stuff ever on The Apprentice happens, and it ends up on the  cutting room floor because there's just not enough time.  And there's no way to, yeah, present it.  You know, it's just not...  How did Gene Simmons behave when he was on?  Because Gene likes to talk, and Gene likes to dominate, but in that situation, in the 
[01:30:00]  boardroom, you really can't.  So how did he act on the...  I had a good time with Gene.  I have a lot of respect for him.  He's a very bright guy, everything like that.  But yeah, you know, he...  In his own world, he's a big dog, but you can't be the big dog when you're a contestant  on the show, and I think, you know, he tried to show that, and that's why he got fired.  By the way, there's no question in my mind, you didn't want to get rid of him, but there's  a point where you take a stand, it goes against everything that the executives and everyone  else said, and it's like, come on, we'll give you the app.  Like, try to...  Like, we just want to fire the guy that no one cares about, Gene, and we'd love to keep 
[01:30:30]  you on this show, but, you know, you can't do it.  Or it stops being real.  Yeah, your dad said that yesterday, the exact same thing.  It's about Dice.  Like, who doesn't want Dice running around like an asshole on the show?  It's very entertaining, but he said if they would have kept him and gotten rid of somebody  else at that time, people would have been like, ah, wait a minute.  Yeah, you can't do it.  I would have loved to have him on there just, you know, creating havoc, and I thought he  was a great guy.  I was disappointed to see him go, but, like, the show has to have credibility.  What was his deal?  He didn't want to make the cupcakes or the cookies or something? 
[01:31:00]  I don't make the cupcakes.  Was it cupcakes?  Well, by the way, also, like, don't kid yourself.  Like, the show is intense, man.  These guys work 20 hours a day.  Right.  There's a lot of personalities.  Like, if you're not ready for that, like, people say, oh, it's a game show.  We'll go on for an hour, and we'll do a little bit, and it's, you know, we'll get a sound  bite in or two.  It's not that way.  It's intense.  And so there's people that get on, and they just cannot keep up, man.  They're freaking exhausted.  They literally just give up.  And so there's an element I've seen of that.  And, you know, there may have been some of that with Dice, where it's just like, holy  crap, I bit off a bit more than I can chew. 
[01:31:30]  Like, I got to get out, and maybe that's the way I get out, by taking a, you know, and you've  seen guys basically quit, because they just can't handle it.  I'm sleepy.  I'm a little tight.  I'm tired over here.  He's on, what, one episode, two episodes?  Yeah, I think it was, he was one of the first guys gone, right?  He was the first one gone, yeah.  We loved it.  He would have been great, too.  He would have been awesome.  Like, he's literally, like, that's one of the ones that disappointed me.  I was like, oh.  Yeah, yeah.  I was Dennis Rodman, man.  Honestly, he's a good guy.  Yeah.  He's a good guy. 
[01:32:00]  You know, I had some fun with him.  You know, is he still having a problem with the drinking?  He was, he seemed like he was actually getting his stuff together.  I think it probably, um, definitely, you know, better than the last time, but it's  sort of, you know, the problem is, I think, you know, that's sort of his thing.  Like, he's got to be the wild and crazy party guy, otherwise there's not, you know, that's  what he's made himself.  That's his image for the last ten years.  You try to remake yourself now, it's a bit hard.  Yeah, but why would he want to be healthy? 
[01:32:30]  Well, because, you know, I think he probably generates a lot of income by being a clubbing  guy and all that stuff, and it's sort of hard to put yourself in that environment.  Right.  You know, if you're going to quit that, you've just got to get the hell out.  You feel like you're losing a piece of yourself, too.  Like, I won't be me without whatever unhealthy thing it is.  But I feel like he has enough money at this point, no?  I would think so, but you never know, man.  Like, a lot, you see that with a lot of the guys.  And I, you know, my dad's, you know, big sports guy.  He's friends with a lot of the athletes.  And, you know, you see these guys that when they're playing, they have these big contracts,  man, but that burn rate is, you know, they blow it. 
[01:33:00]  And you don't know how, you know, you had $100 million, and now you have nothing.  And it happens every time.  People take advantage of them.  They're not particularly financially savvy.  We had one in here recently, and we don't know for sure.  We should say that.  But Dr. J, I'm like, man, this is a guy that should, you know, be set for life.  And maybe he is, but he doesn't have the type of money, you know, the other athletes that came after him that were just, you know.  Well, I think it's probably a little different today, man.  The salaries are just different. 
[01:33:30]  You know, the fame is probably the same, but it's, you know, the compensation today is just insane.  You know, now, that doesn't mean they don't spend equally insane, you know, and end up in the same place.  You don't see many guys that 50 years later, you know, 30 years later, they're still, you know, doing great.  We felt like very few guys transition to be businessmen, effectively.  We felt like you had, you know, some money and a good life, but it wasn't anything you would expect from someone like Dr. J that completely changed the sport and was the guy for so long.  Yeah, I agree with that.  But I think he just missed out on the really, really big salaries. 
[01:34:00]  Correct.  But look at, well, what's his name from Boston?  Just like one dumb major.  Oh, Curt Schilling.  Curt Schilling.  It's like you put everything into one thing.  Oh, God, yeah.  How do you blow $50 million?  Trying to make a video game.  And you see it.  Listen, in business, you see that deal.  It's like, wow, you know, that's going to make me a billionaire.  It's like, you know, if it were that easy.  And I think, you know, that's probably becoming like an American thing.  It's, you know, that, hey, what's the easiest way to make a billion dollars?  Like, you know, as though it was so simple.  Like, you know, it's really not, you know, and I see that in the business world. 
[01:34:30]  Like, you know, everyone likes to say, well, if I had a million bucks, I could turn it into a billion.  It's not that easy.  And so you've got a lot of guys that have always had their asses kissed.  And, you know, they're telling how great they are.  And then, you know, you have a good salesman telling them what they can do with that.  And, you know, it's easy to get suckered into kind of going all in.  Like, you know.  Yeah.  What are you working on these days?  Where are you flying to?  A bunch of deals all over the place.  I love it.  Back and forth to, you know, Scotland a lot for that golf course we have going over there.  Spending a lot of time in India.  A lot of international deals. 
[01:35:00]  You know, probably picking up a lot more of those.  You know, we picked up Doral down in Miami, the golf course.  Did you really?  Yeah, we bought that last year.  We got the big PGA tournament there this week.  You know, this week coming.  So, you know, we're keeping...  I broke my wrist at Doral.  Really?  Drinking or playing golf?  No, I'm not a big drinker, actually.  During our time off.  Rich Foss set us up and we got to play Doral.  Oh, is that where he fucking...  Huh?  Is that where he launched the ball and hit you on the wrist?  Oh, no.  I broke my hand because of Rich Foss, too. 
[01:35:30]  A slight fracture in my left hand.  Well, how did you break your wrist, Plingo?  Well, so, we got out at Doral.  They have, what, three courses, I think?  Five.  Is it five?  Okay.  And we played two...  We might have played three.  Every day we played a different one.  And we got to play the one they actually do the PGA on.  Yeah.  And they were getting ready for the tournament.  So, they didn't have any of the fresh sand and the sand traps.  They had some.  But it was hard pan underneath, and I didn't know that.  It took a full swing in the fucking sand trap.  Wow.  I think it was the first or second hole, and I broke my wrist or my hand. 
[01:36:00]  Something was...  Whoa.  Something was going on.  But it just goes...  Oh, dude.  I mean, like...  Something I'm like...  I say broke, but I never went to a doctor.  But I'll tell you this much.  You couldn't play.  The next T, just hitting the ball, like Ant said, the vibrations was fucking brutal.  So, here we are on this awesome course where the PG gets to play, and I had to hack it  around the course.  Like, I barely could fucking hit the ball.  And every shot hurt like a motherfucker.  And then I had to take off about four or five months from playing golf before it actually 
[01:36:30]  healed properly.  Do you play a lot?  I used to play a lot, but...  You know, if you want to get out, we have a lot of courses in the area that are quite  good also.  Another invite that he will not take me up on, but that's okay.  You're kidding me?  One of these days...  And by the way, you guys are more than welcome.  No, I'm terrible.  I don't know if I want Ant one of our courses.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  I don't know if the beer cart has that much beer, but...  My father-in-law is a big golfer, too.  We'll play that one across the river tomorrow.  That place is supposed to be amazing.  Yeah, Badminster, in Jersey? 
[01:37:00]  Yeah.  That's the big exclusive one.  That's the main one, right?  Yeah, we have a bunch in the area.  I mean, we have one right outside Philly.  We have one in Colts Neck.  We have one in Westchester.  We have one in just north of Westchester.  What's the one near Liberty?  Liberty Island and all that.  Well, the pond would be good for you up here.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  The pool, the pond.  The pond's for you.  But Scotland, that's your deal?  Yeah.  So that's your baby?  Yeah, that's my baby.  That thing's been great.  I mean, it's the highest-rated course to ever open.  It was rated seventh in the world just before anyone had ever even played it, because we just 
[01:37:30]  got the greatest piece of land ever.  And who designed it for you?  Martin Hawtry, who's probably not an architect you'd know, but he's the guy that, in England  for Lynx courses, the royal and ancient, that's their guy.  Any open championship, any open venue, when they're doing some stuff, fixing it up, he's  their guy.  And so just between him and my father, really, you know, my father's good at that stuff.  And he really's got an eye.  So between sort of that traditional Lynx and then my father's sort of, you know, how do  we make it bigger, better, tougher, we came up with something that's just ridiculous. 
[01:38:00]  I have a golf question for you.  We speculated why Augusta let women in.  As somebody that owns a lot of courses, what do you think that really was that finally  broke them?  It's political.  It was, yeah.  I mean, come on.  I love the old school.  I'm probably an old school guy myself, but it's a lot harder for these guys to get away  with it.  They have sponsors.  You know, they make a lot of money from the masters.  Like, you have sponsors and basically saying, yeah, we don't want women.  We don't want minorities.  We don't want this.  It's like, that's so easy.  You know, like when you're a Rolex or whoever the hell sponsors them, it's kind of like, 
[01:38:30]  but, yeah, I don't know.  Can you do something about it?  So they'll, you know, they'll let it water a couple people.  They probably want sponsors then.  I think they're sponsors.  I don't know.  It's not like they need the money.  I mean, you know, that's a...  They felt a lot of pressure.  But they got a lot of pressure.  Our point, because we talk about this from time to time on our show, we're not begging to  get into women's clubs and stuff.  Why do they have to be where we are when we're doing our thing like that?  It's the way of the world, my friend.  And does that sound...  And that sounds...  Everyone wants what, you know, but to go back is almost ridiculous.  You're like, hey, could I play in the WNBA because I'm not good enough to play in the 
[01:39:00]  NBA?  No way.  But if there's someone who's a woman basketball player and she was good enough and that,  you know, that would be acceptable.  But does it sound male chauvinist to say that in this day and age or is it something...  It does, but it's, again, it's...  It is by the definition of the word, but it's ridiculous that we say that.  Because, again, but people can't help...  If women want to be empowered, why wouldn't they go off and there's a ton of powerful  women out there and start their own stuff and say, fuck them.  We don't give a fuck about them.  We're going to start our own traditions and our own clubs just for women. 
[01:39:30]  Because it's, you know, it's a lot easier to do it the other way and, you know, break  balls and they'll eventually win because that's the way, you know, that's where we're  going.  We're just becoming a different society and, you know, for better or worse.  Because, yeah, I mean, it doesn't bother me if I see a woman on the course.  It's just weird, though, that they desperately want to be part of that.  Yeah, but there's something still cool.  I mean, for me, the old school, like, if you have a guy's place, you have a guy's  place.  You know, like...  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  I have a hard time letting go of that.  Maybe I'm not going to have a choice, but, like...  The problem with women is...  You know, I'm kind of a guy's guy, so it's, you know... 
[01:40:00]  They complain and they fuck it up.  Like, I don't like being around just men.  I love when women are around, but they complain.  Yeah, and these harassment...  And that's why we hate them around, because they fuck...  They stop us from doing what we want to do, and they complain.  And, you know, in the clubhouse, guys just want to be guys.  And they want to talk about stuff, and they don't want to have to...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, you know, you start, you know, including too many other things, and all of a sudden,  you're basically having a boring freaking conversation.  Right.  And, by the way, even if you're just talking shit, and, you know, it's not really true...  Well, that's what it mostly is. 
[01:40:30]  There's nothing worse than, like, starting to tell a joke, and then someone...  And you're like, uh...  Yeah, okay.  You know, this kind of screws up that punchline.  Right, right, yeah.  Because it mostly is just bullshitting around.  It's not like, I demand to be able to hang up, you know, nude women pictures.  It's just usually just bullshit.  Joking and...  That you're talking, making jokes that people...  It's the things you never expect, and then HR or someone will come up and go.  I don't even start...  Because, I mean, I'm of that mindset, and, you know, I'll get in trouble, and I'm sure...  I've been on the show enough, I'm sure I'll get myself in trouble one of these days. 
[01:41:00]  But, like, if you can't handle some of the basic stuff that's become a problem in the workforce...  Right, right.  Like, you don't belong in the workforce.  Yeah.  Like, you should go, you know, maybe teach kindergarten.  I think it's a respectable position, but, like...  And those little kids won't be spending it.  You can't be negotiating billion-dollar deals if you can't handle, like, you know...  There's a place where you have to draw the line, but, like, today, this stuff that you get in trouble for,  it's like, I wouldn't even think about, like...  Donald, our stupid world, it's radio, right?  Yeah.  If we want to just look at a naked girl on this computer, watch, we can even do it to just show you what happens. 
[01:41:30]  Everything gets shut down.  If we go, hey, what do we want to see real fast?  Well, you have to, then the curtains have to be shut.  Watch your naked men in the shower.  Let's just...  Yeah.  That's okay, though.  That's okay.  Look.  Look, because they heard already.  Look, turn around.  You've got to close the curtains.  They're going to close the curtains.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Look.  Look.  I'm watching people just for the people...  They're actually closing the curtains.  They're on high alert.  They're not doing it to show the bit off.  They're doing it because they really believe we are actually now...  Well, we are doing it officially.  That's not bad. 
[01:42:00]  I mean, I see some...  Yeah.  But...  Wouldn't it be funny if you showed Tiss and then Donald sued?  Yeah.  I feel harassed.  But Donald, this is great.  This is my get-rich-quick scheme.  I'm now suing you guys because I feel uncomfortable.  And by the way, that's what happens in the world.  Like, I can play along.  I can be fine.  And then I can decide randomly, uh-oh, you now have crossed the line.  Even though I've been going with this.  But this is not a stuffy workplace.  We're in radio where it's, you know, it's known to be a little more edgy and this and that, right?  By the way, if you guys weren't edgy, you'd be off the air. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, then we'd just be a milk toast radio show.  But who would be offended if they walked by our studio in a radio world and saw that  we might be looking at something a little crazy on our computer?  Apparently someone, because the serious people closed the curtains of the studio.  That's hilarious.  Isn't that wild?  They're on high alert.  I mean, someone is listening to the show just...  So they actually pay for an employee to sit there to basically listen to see if this is...  That was scared.  I mean, that's...  They scared the shit out.  I mean, that's where this world is going.  I mean, think about that stuff.  I mean, it's so frustrating. 
[01:43:00]  I hate when the curtains are closed.  Open the goddamn curtains.  Yeah, I don't like them.  Yeah, it's gotten way out of hand.  Political correctness, inability to speak your mind.  I mean, we like for people to be honest, but then the second they are, they get crucified.  Yeah, everything.  I mean, you look at some of the stuff going on in the business world these days.  Look at Hostess.  I mean, they went bankrupt because if they made Twinkies and Wonder Bread in the same factory and delivering them to the same store, they had to have two separate trucks, two separate drivers to bring the same product from point A to point B because of unions and this kind of... 
[01:43:30]  It's like, of course they're going to go bankrupt.  Like, how do you do these things?  And I see it because I spent a lot of time working in Europe and Scotland.  Like, that's where we're going, and it's impossible to do anything there.  Like, it's literally...  You know, there's places in the world that you just don't want to do business because it's so, so much bureaucracy and so much nonsense.  I mean, we were over there, what was it, last week, two weeks ago, and, you know, people are moving a radiator to put it into a spot, and there's two... 
[01:44:00]  The radiator is a small one, like 20 pounds, right?  And I'm watching them, and they have these straps on, and they're tried up, and there's two guys lifting a 20-pound radiator, and they're moving it one inch at a time, putting it down, waiting five seconds, and they're counting.  And I'm like, oh, my God, there's a law that they can't actually pick the stuff up.  They have to have two people doing it.  Oh, Jesus.  They can't...  They're moving it 10 feet, 20 pounds.  I'm like, guys, let me save you 45 minutes.  I just picked it up, and I put it where it needs to go because this is how ridiculous we've gotten as a society.  What country was it? 
[01:44:30]  This was in Scotland.  Oh, Scotland, because I wasn't sure it was India or Scotland.  But, you know, that's where we're getting with the regulation.  The government knows everything, and you can't...  You just can't be efficient anymore, and it's hard to, you know...  How much of that have you had to deal with on job sites here, like where unions are kind of shutting you down?  Or can you do value in your labor, or do you care about the rat in front or not?  By the way, listen, we use...  Because, you know, when you're doing big stuff, it's sort of hard not to in New York, right?  Right.  That said, you know, when I have friends that are in similar businesses, if the rat's in front of the building, I commend them for doing a good job because they're probably doing it efficiently. 
[01:45:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And listen, I'm all for everyone making a good wage and making a good living, but, like, you can't put in rules that are just, you know, where you need two guys doing a job that one guy can do, and they have to be there for a minimum of four hours.  And, you know, I saw this when I was young, just my first real job.  I was working in Atlantic City as a dock attendant, and there was a Coast Guard station on the point there.  And I got to know some of the guys because I was, like, 14, living away from home.  I was hanging out with them.  And there was one day they had a water outage, so they called the plumber. 
[01:45:30]  The plumber comes up to go to the water main, but there was a piece of plywood over the water main.  So they're like, okay, here, you go in.  He's like, no, I can't touch it now because there was a piece of plywood over it.  It wasn't, like, a door and thing.  We need the carpenter here.  And because it's a major water main, we need the master carpenter in the whole area and his assistant.  The problem is the guy was on vacation.  So these guys are in the Coast Guard, right?  They're breaking their ass.  You know, they're protecting our country.  And, like, they can't get water because the freaking union plumber won't even do them a solid. 
[01:46:00]  And is that what the union was supposed to be there for?  Yes.  Is that what the initial...  The notion has changed.  And I talk about, you know, the car companies in America.  And when, you know, what was it, General Motors, like, $6,000 of every car that they make,  like a $30,000 car, goes to pay people who no longer work there.  Yeah.  Like, I don't know how you compete in the world.  Right.  People complain about, well, American manufacturing's disappearing.  It's like, of course it is.  Because someone wants to make $100 to do something that someone somewhere else will make $1 doing. 
[01:46:30]  And the consumer doesn't want to...  And I don't begrudge them the $100, but, like, you can't expect...  But the consumer doesn't want to buy a car that costs that much money...  Yeah, you scale it up, it doesn't work.  ...when they can buy a comparable vehicle that isn't built with this unbelievable labor cost.  Well, well, the devil's advocate thing, and I agree that unions have become annoying.  Yeah, the devil's advocate!  They should make lists.  Yeah, the commie hippie over here.  No, but the union a lot of times, and again, they're very irritating.  But a lot of times the companies don't want to lose profits. 
[01:47:00]  So instead of paying that guy the $100 and keeping $1,000 for themselves,  they want to pay him $20 and keep $1,080 for themselves.  So the guy is just, like, a smaller corporation.  You know what I mean?  I mean, that's all the individual is.  They're as greedy as, at times, the corporations can be.  But we look at the unions and go, look at these greedy fucks.  But a lot of times they were driven to be that way.  By the way, management is definitely at fault for some of these things.  But, again, there's a point where things are rational, and there's a point where things are not rational.  Okay?  The hostess example I used.  You know, you're delivering two products that are going from point A to point B, 
[01:47:30]  and they have to be taken by separate trucks, separate drivers,  and that's part of the mandated stipulations.  Like, that's freaking ridiculous.  What was the point to that?  What was that?  Because the union basically says, we want more Teamster drivers or whatever, you know, Baker drivers.  There's a way to get some more guys working.  And, you know, they've managed to cram this down their throats for a long time,  and then they wonder, like, well, there was mismanagement, and they spent a couple bucks the wrong way.  It's like, yeah, but, you know, like, you also have three times more people than you need to do something.  Like, all of those people now lost their jobs rather than a few. 
[01:48:00]  It's just there's a point where you need to run efficiently.  If you don't, you can't subsidize everything, and that's where we're going with this country.  Everything needs a subsidy.  Everything needs a this because no one can actually make them work on their own.  And it's frustrating to see as an American, and you look at Europe, and, you know, we're there in a few years,  and that's why they can't do anything.  They can't get out of their own way.  Yeah.  Wow.  And we are definitely headed in that direction.  Wow.  Terrible. 
[01:48:30]  What does that just have to do with celebrity opponents at home?  I have no idea, but they're unionizing all of these celebrities.  Who are the ones to look for this season?  You can't name them all, please.  Give us a few highlights here.  Listen, there's the guys that are solid competitors, and there's the guys that are their impediments.  Oh, no, yeah, yeah.  And I think you can look down the list.  I mean, solid competitors.  You said Penn Jillette, Little John.  And, you know, you've got Trace, obviously, you know.  Brett Michaels, who won it. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Brett is, you know, just a great guy and become a great friend.  Let me pick an Albatross.  Let me pick an Albatross.  You've got Alvaro Rosso.  You've got Steven Baldwin.  You've got some guys that are going to get in the way.  Is she nuts, Latoya?  She's a sweetheart.  She's a sweetheart.  This guy's good.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  A lot of crazy people are nice.  Like I said, you know, I spend a lot of time with these guys.  I'll find out when I go fly fishing with them.  He'll tell me about Latoya, as long as the broads aren't around.  The broads.  She seems nuts, though. 
[01:49:30]  Come on.  Listen, I think she's probably got a different mentality, generally, than, you know, you or  I or whatever.  You know, she's definitely, you know, out there in some respects.  But, like I said, you know, there's not a mean bone in her body.  You know, she's just, she's a good person.  The Jacksons in general seem like that.  Well, you know.  Except for the father who beat the shit out of him.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know if history would agree with you.  Yeah, the rest of them seem like they're pretty nice people.  What do we know?  Very cool.  When, I guess Sunday, right?  Yeah, Sunday.  What's up, Sunday and Don? 
[01:50:00]  NBC.  Very cool, man.  Yeah, it's going to be fun.  Nice.  Do you have to go to Donut Day now?  Donuts.  Yeah, I think I'm pretty.  Donuts.  Yeah, I need that like a hole in the head, but I think I'll.  What's your favorite donut?  What?  Oof.  Are you a Krispy Kreme guy?  Oh, in terms of company?  Yeah, let's go company first.  Yeah, I'd say I'm a Dunkin' guy.  Dunkin' Donuts.  You know?  D&D.  Yeah, yeah.  But, you know.  Ah, you just give me a Cruller, I dip it.  What the hell do I know?  Regular Joe.  I don't eat much donuts.  It's not my kind of food.  I try to, you know, I try to avoid those. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Unnecessary.  You try to eat healthy?  I like stinky donuts.  I don't eat healthy, no, and I work out hard, but I'd much rather have a steak, you know,  kind of meal than, you know, load up in donuts and then feel guilty for the rest of the day.  So I work out hard so I can eat what I want, but it's generally not like snack junk food.  With kids in the house, there's always treats around.  I try to keep all that shit out of the house.  I can't waste food.  But now I can't with kids.  Grandmother beat that into me, so I can't waste food.  So when the kids, you know, they order this and they order that, and it's just like all of it's left over, 
[01:51:00]  and I'm like, okay, I'll finish.  Like, it's hard with kids.  Wow.  You really can't waste food.  I have a hard time with it.  I have a hard time with it.  It was like, you know, you got that guilt trip from, like, my, you know, Czechoslovakian grandmother.  It was like, I didn't spend two years hiding in a basement from the Nazis.  You know, I was like, you know.  All right, that's a lot worse, because I was going to say, my mom would put the egg timer on,  and we had to finish our meal every single fucking time, and it was a nightmare.  So when I got older, it's so freeing to go, boom, and throw it in the garbage. 
[01:51:30]  It wasn't a requirement per se, but it was definitely made very clear that you just want a little brat.  And I'm just like, okay, I'll eat all those unnecessary.  You know, and her idea of healthy food is like, sure, throw some sour cream on it.  It's great for you.  Oh, my God.  It's pretty rough.  Do you have to eat crap, like, stuff that you didn't really like?  No, listen, I grew up with it, so that Eastern European, like, Germanic food is, like, it's right up my alley,  so I can eat like that, and that's why I try to avoid the other crap. 
[01:52:00]  Did it make you OCD with money to a certain degree?  Not necessarily crazy OCD, but, like, where it's like some people get very caught up in that when you're a kid,  if you're hearing it, where you have, like, you say you fly coach everywhere, and, like, there's reasonable saving,  and then there's that thing where it's just like, oh, fuck, I saved a little bit.  Yeah, I think I probably push it on certain things, whether, you know, again, the flying thing is probably not one of them,  because it's more of a, that's more of a principle thing than a, you know, but, listen, I indulge in my hobbies,  but I probably, like, I don't spend a lot of money on clothes, because I don't give crap, you know what I mean? 
[01:52:30]  I'm just not, like, I'm not one of those guys that has to be the guy wearing the, you know, $2,000 shoes.  I feel like a jerk off, like, so, you know, but, you know, I definitely indulge in my, you know, my firearms hobby,  and, you know, those kind of things.  You're a New York resident, right?  Oh, yes.  Don't even get me started.  Having any troubles?  No, I just wanted to quickly delve into that part of it.  Yeah, no, well, listen, I don't have any troubles, because I'll comply with the laws.  That's what it is, yeah.  But, like, I feel like a jerk, you know, you have a 10-round mag to put seven rounds in it, 
[01:53:00]  because the criminal's gonna, you know, he's gonna say, oh, crap, I got 10 rounds, I'm gonna take those top three off.  I want to comply with the law before I go use this in a crime.  Yeah, so I'll carry a 1911, and I have a lot of 8-round mags for my 1911, I'll make up for it in extra firepower,  but, like, so am I breaking the law by putting 8 rounds into my mag so I can have one in the chamber?  Because I can have 8 rounds in the gun, but one has to be in the chamber.  But I can't have an empty chamber with 8 rounds in the mag.  With 8 rounds in the mag.  How stupid are we?  You know, listen, honestly, that was Cuomo acting for the sake of action.  Uh-huh.  The rules that were implemented, and by the way, I'm fine with some of the executive orders, 
[01:53:30]  I'm fine with background checks, like, I'm not a nut with some of these things,  but I'm also a competitive shooter.  You know, I compete with an AR-15, you know, my teammates are national champions, like,  you know, there's a lot of discipline to this thing, the whole assault weapon,  and when you look at the grand scheme of things,  how many people in America are killed by assault weapons versus illegal guns.  By the way, make, crack down on illegal guns.  You know, people who don't register, don't, by the way, make it really difficult on them,  but then you can't do that because then someone's going to say,  oh, you're disproportionately affecting some community, you know. 
[01:54:00]  Exactly.  Like, it's nonsense.  So, you know, the New York stuff is insane.  Cuomo acted for the sake.  He just wants, when he's running in a couple years, he wants to say,  hey, I'm the first guy to act, look what I act,  even though he basically prevented police, you know, they didn't think this through.  The police weren't allowed to have 10 rounds in their magazines.  Like, it's so stupid.  Yeah.  It's ridiculous.  And, again, I'm not, you know, against some things within reason.  Exactly.  I'm fine with background checks.  I'm fine with, you know, the mental health stuff.  But, you know, you have, you know, people that have kids that have issues, 
[01:54:30]  and I, trust me, as a parent, I get that.  That'd be the worst thing in the world.  And, you know, but to track, you know, crack down on mental health and those aspects,  oh, my God, you're going to offend some lobby of people who don't want their kids.  Like, you know, I get that.  But, like, don't attack, you know, that's like going after fat people, you know,  and saying, well, we're going to ban spoons.  Because, you know, that's what made them fat.  Like, you know, you've got to act.  They should ban spoons because people play them.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  So, I mean, it's gotten, you know, sort of weird things. 
[01:55:00]  And you'll jump through the hoops, and I'll jump through the hoops,  and everything will be great.  Yeah, because I'm not willing to go to jail for some of these things.  But the guy that you're looking to actually stop, they're not going to follow this thing.  They're not going to comply.  And they're going to do whatever they want.  So it's really ridiculous, and it's a shame.  And, you know, and it's just the first step.  Exactly.  And it's not just about guns.  It's probably about everything.  You know, and, you know, the government regulation of this.  You know, more people are killed annually by, like, a factor of four or five with baseball bats.  What, are we going to ban bats?  Yeah.  You know, and if you look at the U.K., okay, you know, 
[01:55:30]  they banned guns, and they banned this, and it's impossible.  Guess what?  Their violent and vicious crime and their murder rates are higher than us,  because if someone's that crazy, they're going to do it.  And they just get stabbed every day.  You know, people just get stabbed, and they get hashed up, and they get beat with it.  There's a lot of bludgeonings and strangulation.  You're not going to stop someone from crazy by, like, eliminating one thing.  They're just going to switch what their modus operandi is.  So, you know, to institute all these policies against law-abiding citizens for the sake of, you know, action,  and, I guess, listen, I get it. 
[01:56:00]  It's hard to say, you know, given what happens and all these things,  but, like, you know, you look at the guy that did Newtown.  Hey, like, that freaking kid was crazy.  Like, you know, like, I don't like the stereotype I get,  but you look at that picture, like, there's something wrong with him.  That guy's batshit crazy.  And no one wants to talk about video games that he played eight hours a day.  And, like, that kid's freaking crazy.  Like, it's not, I'm like, you know.  I think the news media also, mainstream news media,  how they just plaster the guy's faces all over the place, read their manifestos,  make them the heroes, the anti-heroes that they want to be. 
[01:56:30]  Correct.  So the next guy looks and goes, well, I'm a piece of shit, nobody.  I want to be famous.  I have no ability to do that.  But if I do this, I'm going to be all over it.  Yeah, and the news media never calls themselves out on that.  Well, and they also manipulate the statistics so much.  And when, you know, Diane, when these people, you know, they're talking about,  well, this is the, you know, just because something aesthetically looks like something  doesn't make it, you know.  You have people that are legislating without any facts.  It's like watching the Senate Finance Committee back during the bad banking days a few years ago, 
[01:57:00]  like, where, you know, they're asking more, you know, Goldman Sachs, how many home loans they made.  It's like, that's not what they do.  Like, if you're making trillion-dollar decisions, you should at least understand the business model.  Just like if you're making gun legislation, you should know the difference between what is and what isn't.  And not just arbitrarily spew out facts that sound convenient but have no merit.  The most uneducated people I've ever seen about guns are the anti-gun people.  Correct.  They don't know anything.  They don't know an automatic from a semi-automatic.  They don't know rifles from shotguns from â€“ they're really uneducated. 
[01:57:30]  Well, and when they're talking about, like, some of the aesthetic things that you can put on an AR,  like, well, the vertical grip, well, that makes it much more deadly.  Look at that.  More deadly.  Stop.  Yeah, you guys should get a room.  Oh, it's great.  We're going to make it out later.  It's going to be fun.  Wow.  All right, guys, I've got to go do Daddy Donut.  All right, Donuts.  I look forward to being back on soon.  Yeah, this was great.  Donald Trump Jr.  Thanks.  You guys can ask and help.  We're going to do it.  All right.  Open invite.  I told you, Roland has all of my contact information.  I think we need to exchange, didn't we? 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, you have it.  You have it.  You're just pretending you don't.  No, I'm not pretending.  We're going to do this.  I'm going to write Rich today and set up my little...  Oh, I do have Rich's number, too.  I'm going to text him right now.  We'll go float.  Listen, it opens April, but I'd say let's go in May when it gets a little bit better.  Some of those early days can be cold and painful.  It can be good, but it's...  It's cold, though, right?  It can suck.  We floated last time.  It was nice.  Yeah, just in the boat on the river for like eight straight hours.  You wouldn't like that, right, Jimmy? 
[01:58:30]  We had one sandwich.  All I would think of is how bad I had to shit.  I didn't have to shit.  I cannot do anything outdoorsy.  Oh, my God.  You have no idea.  On that note, I'm out.  Good seeing you guys.  I hate that.  All right, listen, Celebrity Apprentice, Sunday night at 9 o'clock at NBC.  Thanks, man.  Thanks, guys.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I got a picture of a holy ground from the wedding in the show. 
[01:59:00]  It's just a burning edge of memory.  I never can kiss you tell.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  STP day, right?  You like this one, Ant?  Yeah.  I'm a big STP fan.  Absolutely.  Which one did you used to sing?  I did the slow one, the fast ones.  I did a few STP ones.  No, there was one that was your go-to song for a while.  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:59:30]  Here I feel it.  Here I feel it.  I just don't like this whole era of music.  I don't think it stinks.  It just didn't resonate with me.  I wish I did.  I enjoyed some of the stuff from it, but it just did not.  You know who else didn't like that era?  Gays.  In the 90s?  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  No, gays.  Why?  Because I'm calling you gay.  Oh. 
[02:00:00]  What's gay?  Oh.  I like girls.  Oh.  With this.  So what?  Why don't you just say that?  I didn't say that.  I didn't say that.  I like girls with big ears.  Don't be so prejudiced.  Jimmy's going to be at Poco Nuts.  He doesn't want to mention it for some reason.  And where are you staying again, Jimmy?  Beautiful Mount Harry Lodge.  I like the dynamic he gets on that.  He feels good, man.  He sells it.  He does.  He should be their spokesperson.  I got dates in other cities coming up, and then Caroline's April 11 through 14. 
[02:00:30]  And I'm just pushing that, because everybody else is selling out their shows.  And just, why would I?  You should get one of those lights that make it like it's summer.  That Troy Kwan was talking about.  Yeah.  Maybe it's winter.  I should get a light that makes it look like there's more people in a room than there actually are.  That's what I need.  I don't need the summer lights.  I need fucking people makers and seats.  Oh, boy.  You can get some of those cardboard people. 
[02:01:00]  I realize I'm fucking a week away from getting the fucking Rupert Pumpkin-type props and just setting them up and talking to them.  I got to catch up, bud.  My right.  My right, ladies and gentlemen.  I think you're going to sell out Caroline's.  I'll sell out a couple of the shows.  And Poker Nuts.  What's going on up there?  I don't even know.  I know.  In 100% honesty, I don't care.  I just, I'm meaning, I want people to be there, but I'm putting the hour together, and that's all I care about. 
[02:01:30]  And that's going to be great in Boston.  We know that.  I, uh, can I see the picture of you?  Good Friday, right?  That's a great picture.  That's a, that, that, that should bring people in.  Good job, guys.  Um.  You look like you're going, ah, what do you want from me?  Regular joke.  Regular joke.  That's fat pig.  Regular fat pig alien face.  Holy shit!  I'm so, uh, I'm pleasantly uncomfortable.  I know.  That's possible.  Aw.  I don't know how you could be pleasantly uncomfortable, but I, uh, oh, stop, Jimmy. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah, it's true.  It's actually going to be great.  I feel very good about the material.  Um, I'm happy where the act is.  Very happy.  Um, uh, a lot of the topical stuff, I'm just trimming, so it holds up in six months, like, you know what I mean?  Or, you know, when it's on Netflix eventually.  You know what I mean?  You want it to hold up.  Right.  I think, I think, please be offended, some of the stuff's a little bit too time sensitive, but, you know, that's, that's what I was doing, and that's what's up.  Yeah.  Uh, but this one I want to be slightly more.  I want to, I want to go to Boston for the taping, but it's a weird weekend with, uh, Easter. 
[02:02:30]  Easter, yeah.  But literally, the venue just didn't have availability in May, June, and I wanted to shoot there.  The show's Friday, though.  Good Friday?  Friday night, two shows.  So then we leave, we come back home Saturday.  I agree.  And then we get, uh, the, the Easter egg thing done Sunday.  Yeah, it's not Easter Sunday.  I mean.  I gotta die, I gotta do the dying of the eggs and stuff.  I'm back in that world.  You're back in that world.  I was, I was out of that world for, fuck, decades.  Many years.  Next thing you know, I'm back in that world.  You're back mixing them up, dropping little colored things in there.  With the vinegar, the vinegar, the, the, the colored tablets, all this shit you forgot about fucking decades ago. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  And now we're dipping eggs.  Do you know the best way to color eggs?  Mm.  Is you put paint on the inside of the hen's pussy.  Put red paint inside the hen's pussy.  Holy shit.  But the, uh, the egg dyeing company, though, they're lazy fucks. 
[02:03:30]  Nothing has changed since we were doing it as kids.  Still the little, uh, the little fucking metal wiry thing that is almost impossible to keep  the egg on.  Yeah.  It always falls off.  Falls off into your stupid cup of dye.  Yeah, it's like trying to move an invalid on a glass, a piece of glass.  There's no back to it.  Right.  And you would, you would think they would have updated this shit by now.  And then the cardboardy thing that you put your eggs in to dry.  To dry, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That falls apart.  It's all mushy.  They were able to use the box for fucking part of the thing. 
[02:04:00]  Nah, nah, they just haven't updated that well.  I wonder if Sandy Duncan, when she was, when she has kids, Sandy Duncan, I wonder if she'd  hide an egg in her fucking eye socket behind the eye.  And they would notice, mommy's peeper looks bulgy.  And then she would fucking peel her eye out and a stinky eye socket egg would fall out.  Beautiful Mount Airy Lodge.  Beautiful Mount Airy Lodge.  And they don't have feather pillows, so I have to bring my own pillows. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, you like bringing your own pillow.  I only do it when you don't have feather pillows.  Any place that doesn't have feather pillows sucks.  Those fucking horrible hard rubber pillows.  What am I, in a mental hospital, you cunts?  Fucking terrible.  And this is an upgrade from the hotel they wanted.  I'm paying for half this hotel.  I would love to mock you, but my last trip to LA, I brought my own pillow.  You did?  Oh, God, I won't do that.  I'll buy one in the city.  I won't bring it cross country.  Why?  Nah, it's too much.  I don't want to lose it and carry it.  Hi, I have a pillow. 
[02:05:00]  It was nice.  Can't do it.  It was nice.  So then when I lean up against that window, I got a nice pillow instead of this stupid fucking...  That makes sense.  Airplane pillows.  Your head fucking gets wedged between the seat and the side of the plane.  Yeah.  Especially for all the way to LA.  Come on.  Crazy.  You need a good pillow.  I like to bring a good...  But when you take certain flights, they have great...  This is where Donald Trump Jr. and I disagree.  His life is, you know, he chooses to fly.  Coach, I do not. 
[02:05:30]  I do not.  I do not.  Yes.  And it's a write-off.  So it's so cool being in a business where it's a legitimate write-off.  It's not a bullshit write-off.  I just love how you say that.  I do not.  I did that for many years of my career.  What?  Terrible coach flights.  How are we all doing?  Yeah, fuck that.  Oh, he's coming down the whole floor.  Oh.  What's he coming down the whole floor?  Steve.  Oh, wait.  She wants to show off his new haircut.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  And his shirt.  He's like, you know, I came to work like a 13-year-old boy today.  Oh, Jesus.  It's casual Friday. 
[02:06:00]  Is it?  Yes.  I didn't realize it.  They love casual Friday.  He's shaking his head.  He knows.  I know.  It's new hair to do Friday.  Also known as dress like Opie Anthony at Jim Norton Day.  Yeah.  We get to do this every fucking day.  Every day is casual day.  And these knuckleheads on Fridays get to dress down.  Welcome, Steve, to Fresh Haircut Day.  Tell him we're happy that he's bringing his fresh haircut.  It is fresh.  It's very, very much a bad...  He should have a trapper keeper with that hairdo.  Holy shit.  Very back to school-ish.  I love the idiots that have casual Friday outfits that they know they purposely bought 
[02:06:30]  just for casual Friday.  That defeats the purpose.  Instead of, like, just getting your regular jeans and the shit you would wear that you...  But they have to overthink that as well.  You know what we should do?  We should make Gary wear a hairpiece on Fridays.  Holy shit.  He should have to wear a wig.  Was anyone else really uncomfortable looking at his new glasses?  Casual toupee day.  Yes.  Was anyone else uncomfortable looking at his new glasses?  Foghorn Leghorn's nephew?  No, he looked terrific.  Oh, my God. 
[02:07:00]  He was saying something to me the other day.  Hey, boy.  I was trying to be nice for once, and it took everything I have in my fucking body not to  openly laugh at his new glasses.  He's not listening now, so he doesn't know what's going on.  Hey, boy, you're about as sharp as a bag of wet mice.  Wait, can I see that guy?  What a dull thing that is.  I keep pitching him, and you keep missing him, boy.  I gotta see those glasses now.  No, there were too many, like, sides to his.  Yeah.  What were they, like, octagons, or?  Did you see his glasses? 
[02:07:30]  They looked very, very complicated.  I wasn't really gazing into his eyes as much.  It's not that you're gazing into his eyes.  It just looked like a silly prop on his face.  Now he's going to break his glasses, right?  Yeah, well, you made fun of him.  Hopefully somebody else will.  I can take the money and run.  Every time he walks in to see Scott, Scott throws his glasses on the floor and snaps on him.  Beautiful Mount Harry.  I think I've heard.  What?  That Gary will be the representative for management on the bus trip with us. 
[02:08:00]  What?  What are you talking about?  What bus trip?  We don't need a representative.  What is he talking about?  You gotta have someone for management just to keep it safe.  No, what is he talking about?  Well, somebody's gotta be there.  So he's gonna, what, follow in a car?  He's not on my bus.  Not on my bus.  No, he's not gonna be on Anthony's bus.  So how is he getting around?  He'll probably be on one of the buses.  No.  I'm telling you right now.  But why do you see your bus and Anthony's bus?  They're separate buses.  They are. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, they're supposed to be.  That's the story right now.  There's two buses.  You want your bus, Jimmy?  No, but we're doing separate buses.  There's a party bus.  It's gonna be a convoy.  It's gonna be Opie's bus and Anthony's bus.  And then a bus of depression.  And a bus of mental illness.  And from what I hear, I hear tell, the scuttlebutt is that Troy Kwan, when we go to these various  places, will be supplying the bitches.  He said, we're supplying the bitches.  And the music, he could be a DJ. 
[02:09:00]  Troy brought that up in our meeting.  He did?  About picking up girls along the way and dropping them off in other spots.  And all eyes are on Jim Norton.  We're all waiting to see which bus you'd pick.  I'll jump between them, actually.  There'll be times where I want the craziness, the alcoholism, and the racism, and there'll  be times where I just want the uncomfortable staring straight ahead on Twitter.  I'll go to both.  I'll go between my two parents.  But you kind of made his bus sound a little too much fun.  What, the racism and the alcoholism? 
[02:09:30]  That's not fun to anybody.  Oh, it's hilarious.  It is.  Troy Kwan's gonna be bringing bitches.  There's gonna be drinking games.  We'll probably be playing rolling beer pong and fucking quarters.  See, that'll be too much for me.  I'll jump back and forth.  But I'm banning Twitter on my bus.  What?  You should ban drinking and no loud conversation.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  Our bus is gonna be a safe place.  It's a quiet car.  You're allowed to read.  Yes.  Yeah, I'm gonna have a fully stocked bookshelf. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, man.  With all the classics.  Why are we doing this?  We're not doing this.  What are you kidding me?  This will never go through.  Something's gonna fall through.  You know that.  I have not made plans for this.  Okay.  Yeah.  People around me in my regular life, they're like, when are you going?  So when are you doing this?  Oh, no.  We're not doing this.  So we could schedule our shit like we usually do.  We might.  I don't know.  They will absolutely come to us.  Something will get fucked up.  And it'll be something that they're not responsible for.  It's something that was happening from upstairs or some things. 
[02:10:30]  We gotta flash.  And then it'll be like, ah, well, but we can get, you know those bachelor party buses?  We could get one of those.  And we're thinking of maybe going out to a club on Long Island or Jersey and having some  of the listeners there.  So we could go from bus trip to that.  I'm absolutely not scheduling this.  I don't know.  We are in our meeting on Tuesday.  Oh, it sounds like we're doing it, Sam.  I'm with you.  I understand everything you're saying. 
[02:11:00]  Sam, we were going to go to the Super Bowl, too.  I love how Sam thinks we just started in this business.  Oh, I know.  We did.  Sam.  It sounds like we're doing this.  I understand that part.  You do a cute little show every day.  It's adorable.  But leave the experience.  Right.  And what we know from that experience to us.  You know how many times we truly believed we were doing something and it fell through?  Uh-huh.  How many?  I hope they proved me wrong.  Us wrong.  Because we're already talking about how to schedule the channel, when we're going to  go live.  Oh, really? 
[02:11:30]  That's great.  The ability to just throw stuff on at any point in the day.  That's terrific.  Sounds like a fucking wonderful world.  Where is this place?  Yeah, yeah.  Where is this place?  You know, recording at a moment's notice.  I hear you, Sam.  It sounds great.  It always sounds great on paper.  Sure.  Schedule.  Nashville to Memphis to Branson to Austin.  Oh, nice.  That's where they want to go?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, the Southeast.  Okay.  Yeah, like Dollywood. 
[02:12:00]  All the weird places we've talked about.  Memphis, Nashville.  Sure, sure.  Okay.  Branson.  And then, yeah.  And then a big show in Austin.  Yeah, I don't know why Memphis, though.  Do we have a big following in Memphis?  Oh, my God.  Just to see Graceland.  Yeah.  We're doing that for ourselves.  We should do that.  Yeah.  There'll be some people.  I've been there once.  It was fun.  I want to see Graceland.  Yeah.  Yeah, I went up.  I just got us kind of a semi-private tour.  Oh, did you get to see shit that other people don't get to see?  No.  I mean, although...  Probably did.  They probably give you a little slightly extra, no?  We might be able to now, because, you know, some people have the same management people 
[02:12:30]  as Elvis, so...  Oh.  I know the guy that owns Elvis.  I am Elvis.  I am Elvis.  In my own way.  It's this guy.  I love this guy.  He also owns Muhammad Ali.  Oh, he's the one who introduced me to Ali.  Who?  Craig.  No.  But the guy that works...  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's my brother's billionaire friend.  Mm-hmm.  Literally.  My brother's a friend. 
[02:13:00]  He's friends with a billionaire.  Me, not so much.  Will he be on the bus?  Me, not so much.  Not?  What?  Can you get Ali to get on the bus?  I don't think so.  Trying to figure out, like, different celebrities who might be able to get on the bus for legs?  We'll get none.  So...  No celebrities who are on the bus.  Can you imagine if they...  We have such a connection at Graceland, they go, hey, man, you know what?  Just go wherever you want.  Just walk around here.  You got the next hour to go wherever the hell you want.  Lock up when you leave.  Here's the keys to everything.  It's like, when you want to just go in the basement or the attic or just some... 
[02:13:30]  All these fucking...  It's not basement in Graceland.  Yeah.  Just keep your...  You know, don't go into Lisa Marie's room, or if you do, just don't, like, you're stuck  on to her panties.  Just jacking off.  Hugging it.  Fuck.  Does anyone live there now?  I think she still does.  I'm sure.  Oh, does she really?  And the mother.  Sure.  I'm guessing.  That's probably one of them.  Maybe she stays there once in a while.  Take the pink Cadillac out for a drive.  Yeah, you know, here's the keys.  Yeah.  Enjoy.  It might be depressing that you have no time alone there.  It's not...  I'm sure they have other places. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Remember the time we called to ask about the duty that they fished out of the toilet when  they found Elvis?  We did.  We called.  And the lady was trying to have fun with us, but just hated us.  Of course she did.  We were convinced they had to have it in a jar somewhere.  Yeah, the last duty.  That they fished out Elvis's duty.  Elvis's last duty.  What are we doing?  I don't know.  While we're waiting, we're stalling.  For what?  Exactly.  Because there's a delivery.  Oh, is that what was going on here?  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, we're so good at this.  I was just thinking that. 
[02:14:30]  I didn't even know we were stalling.  You got a half a rod.  Over sandwiches?  No.  Sandwiches.  So why are we doing it?  I don't know.  What, the bus tour?  No, the birthday celebration.  I don't know.  I don't know what's going on.  There it is.  It's the birthday boy, right?  Yeah.  We got some fucking treats.  Should we bring him rock in?  Let's bring him in.  I think so, too.  It's his birthday.  We give him a hard time all year.  And I think this should be his special day.  Why do I feel like this isn't going to end well?  Why?  It's great.  Can we be nice guys for once?  Absolutely.  We can.  He's walking around right now. 
[02:15:00]  He got you a nice little thing.  He did.  He hooked me up with my Michaela Maroney autograph and picture and everything.  The fat fuck is coming around now.  And audio.  I can't hear it.  And audio.  We got her talking about me.  It's great.  Beautiful Mountaine.  Oh.  There it is.  Hi, Iraq.  Happy birthday.  It's the end of the celebration.  How old are you, Iraq?  41.  41?  36?  35.  30?  35.  That is the midway point right there. 
[02:15:30]  What did your wife get you or you don't know yet?  Oh, tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  I saw it.  You know what?  I saw a billboard, though, that said a person's going to live to 150 is alive today.  Oh, yeah?  Did you see that billboard?  It's on the way into the Midtown Tunnel.  It's not us, no.  It's probably like a baby.  No, I understand that.  No one thinks there's 45.  Yeah, probably just a little older.  But they said someone will live to 150 years old, and they're alive today.  Wow.  How about that?  Do you think that's possible? 
[02:16:00]  I wish it was me.  Who can tell in the future?  I'd be happy to be a little short and live to 110.  Good one.  Happy birthday, cocksucker.  Oh.  What'd you get?  I got a Lamborghini for my birthday.  What'd you get?  Wow.  You know what's good about the Iraq thing?  35.  Still got a very good head of hair.  You son of a bitch.  That's pretty good.  What's the genetics like in your family with hair?  Good.  It's what's under it that's not too good. 
[02:16:30]  I'll just continue to throw setups out there for Jimmy.  Whatever happens.  Look at me.  I'm so happy with my joke.  I got a boner.  He's still got a boner.  Jimmy's pants is sticking straight out.  Still not gay.  That was just fun.  No, it was hilarious.  So all the DNA was used making the hair look all nice.  Man.  What are you doing for your birthday?  Yeah.  What's on the agenda?  I think I'm going out to dinner tomorrow. 
[02:17:00]  Oh.  One of them Brazilian places.  Oh, where they cut the meat off the fucking platform in the city.  The little paddles.  Got a tip for you.  I learned the hard way.  Yep.  Wait a little while.  Wait.  Pass on a couple of the early ones, because they try to fill you up, so then when they  bring out the nice stuff, you don't eat too much of that shit.  You think I'm a rookie at this.  Oh, you know.  Exactly.  Oh, you really are.  You're teaching funny.  Maybe you told me.  You're telling Tom Brady to stay in the pocket. 
[02:17:30]  I didn't know this, though.  I learned the hard way.  Was it Patrice?  Patrice.  Patrice.  He took us to the one a couple blocks from here.  Yeah, plataforma.  Yeah.  He says you got to pass on the, or just take a little nibble.  Depends on what you like, though.  I don't like a lot.  It's just too fattening, so I don't eat like that.  A lot of salt, man.  Holy shit.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You feel your arteries pumping after you go to one of those joints.  So Jim.  Yeah.  You don't start with skirt steak.  I love a good skirt steak.  But they salt the shit out of it where it does taste good.  But then that filet comes out and you're too full.  Yeah, you're all full.  You get a good piece of it.  Do you eat those?  Oh. 
[02:18:00]  You like a good bacon-wrapped filet?  Well, they wrap the lower-quality shit with bacon.  Yeah.  Tricky little bit.  The really good ones come out.  They're just a huge, juicy, red.  Yeah, on a skewer and they got a machete.  That perfect red color.  Cutting it off.  Not too much, not too little.  Perfect.  You like the bacon-wrapped stuff?  It's a start.  I haven't had it in a long time, but I wouldn't mind some bacon-wrapped stuff.  I love bacon.  Extra crispy, though.  It can't be crispy when it's wrapped around like a sausage or whatever. 
[02:18:30]  Sausage.  I like turkey bacon.  Just to match it up.  No, at that point, just eat the bacon.  But I like a good piece of turkey bacon.  It's very salty.  What?  Turkey bacon stinks.  They got to salt the shit out of it to make it almost taste like bacon.  If you're going to eat bacon, you might as well just fucking dip it into the bacon world for a little bit.  Right.  Then get back to that gym next day.  Oh, boy.  Are we going today?  I have to.  Well, yesterday, too.  You know what it is?  When you do all those pull-ups, you just get tired.  Oh, how many are you doing now? 
[02:19:00]  70.  70?  How many?  You're kidding?  How many in a set?  13, 13, 10, 10, 12, 12.  No help.  He's not like on that machine where it takes some weight away.  I've seen him.  He's an animal with the pull-ups.  Hands this way or this way?  Fingers toward you or fingers away?  Fingers away.  Fingers away.  I can't do fingers towards me because I still have that fucking elbow thing, and that's  almost like curling, and that I'm doing right now hurts.  Fingers toward me a lot easier than fingers away.  I would love to do them, but they hurt me. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  I've seen them.  How does he do it?  He does sets of 10, 12 at a time.  We need a bar in here so he can fucking...  Dude, over and over again.  I mean, I would...  No, I can't...  Whatever.  13.  I can't even come close to what he's doing.  It's crazy.  And as I'm doing, I'll count them off.  Oh, one, and two, and three.  And four, and one.  That's pretty goddamn impressive.  We have a routine.  Yeah.  Because we're... 
[02:20:00]  We go to the gym.  We hide our cocks from the men who are trying to look at them, including each other.  The meat gazers.  But now we learn there's a meat-gazing chair.  Yeah.  Perfect for your meat-gazing.  And someone told me there's an app on the phones that makes it look like you're actually  on a real website, but you're actually taking video the whole time.  And so that's what this fucking Peter Pumper could be doing.  Oh, no.  Really?  Fucking Alan Arkin-looking fucking pasty walk on the treadmill every day and do nothing  for your awful body.  You see how he walks on the treadmill?  Yeah, he holds on and just walks creepy.  It's the weirdest walk I've ever seen. 
[02:20:30]  He's a loose asshole.  I'm trying to figure out how I can describe it.  Creepy.  You're right.  Picture a pedophile walking uphill.  But his shoulders are way up in the air, but then it's curved.  Yeah.  And then...  I don't know.  He's terrible.  It's hard to explain, I guess.  It's like he's missing one leg muscle or something, so his legs don't work quite right.  But they do work, because we see him walking around.  Then we have the juice lady, but Jimmy finally turned her, where she sees Jimmy and she goes,  Oh, hi, regular sweetie.  All those pet names.  Uh-huh.  And then I'll go, same lady, same shit. 
[02:21:00]  She goes, what do you want?  And slaps the blender down.  What the fuck?  Well, I saw it tonight.  But in all fairness, you're going to say, of course people would act like that toward me.  She's like that with most people.  She likes Jimmy.  But obviously, she likes Jimmy.  I have a feeling she might even be a fan or something.  She might be, yeah.  Because she...  A lot of people would side with me that she's kind of a twat.  But when she sees Jimmy, it's all pet names, regular...  Oh, don't worry. 
[02:21:30]  She goes like this.  Oh, don't worry about it.  We'll take care of that later.  Everything's so convenient for Jimmy.  I forgot to mention, I saw her.  And then she slams, like, there's a big bowl.  You've got to collect all the vegetables for a fruit drink.  And she's just throwing it around.  The vegetables she throws in, and they go up the lid and off the side.  She's just so annoyed that she's got to make me a juice drink.  I saw her the other day, and she's like, where have you been?  I was like, oh, I was in Vegas, you know, working.  She goes, what about us?  And I'm like, well, you know, I meant to come back in. 
[02:22:00]  She goes, no, why didn't you take us with you?  Yeah, she likes Jimmy.  I'm not there.  Yeah.  But she's cool with me now because of Jimmy.  She's absolutely cool now.  Oh, okay.  And then I got a, what could only be described as a two that is the one that flirts with  me.  Oh, no.  The one who looks like fucking Rerun?  Yes.  She's the worst.  Oh, no.  But she flirts with me.  She's the one that gives me the pet name.  She goes, hey, baby.  Yeah.  She looks like Bookman from Good Times.  Oh, God.  Not a handsome man.  No.  Horrendous.  But, man, she likes me.  She is an unsexy monster. 
[02:22:30]  What are we waiting for?  What are we doing here?  Yeah, why are we waiting?  That's right.  That's it.  Oh, Roland, come on in.  Are we doing the...  Bring him in.  Happy birthday thing.  Bring him in.  Yeah, it's a birthday for E-Rock.  This is a birthday celebration for E-Rock.  Whatever E-Rock wants today, except respect.  We get...  Ooh, what do we got here?  I know this guy.  Oh, you got to go over there with us.  They have Huggies.  Holy fuck.  Thank you.  There you go.  Huggies.  How are you guys?  Huggies.  No, it's a hoagie. 
[02:23:00]  Brooklyn Italian Heroes.  How do you say your name?  Leone?  Leone.  Leone, but...  All right, it's L-I-O-N-I.  Leone.  Brooklyn Italian Heroes.  Brooklyn means quality.  Where'd you play?  Featuring the king of fresh Mootsettles.  15th Avenue on Bensonhurst.  Oh, okay.  Wait, talking to the mic.  No one heard the plug.  Yeah, he said 78th Street and 15th Avenue?  78th Street and 15th Avenue in Brooklyn.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  It's been about 25 years.  All right, so you got the Tony Bennett, the Joe Montana, the Phil Esposito, the Mario Andretti. 
[02:23:30]  We basically made a hero shop named after Italian-American heroes.  Right.  Oh, now I got the gimmick.  Yes.  The Vince Lombardi.  Where's the Anthony Cumia?  What about Anthony Cumia?  Anthony Cumia.  One of the most popular Italian-American heroes.  All right, where are you talking?  Well, there's a little research done to see what people eat.  So Frank Sinatra loved salami.  Oh, he did?  And we just ate it some fresh mozzarella and olive oil, and that was a sandwich. 
[02:24:00]  You can't do much better than a fucking, like a sub place in Brooklyn.  You can't get better food than that.  You got like a hundred and...  You got like a hundred and...  I'm going to...  I'm going to...  Two hundred and fifty-three.  Two hundred and fifty-three sandwiches.  You got the Pat Cooper.  You got the Pat Cooper.  Oh.  Number forty-five.  Yes.  Yes.  What's all this stuff, Roland?  So we brought a bunch of sandwiches with us today from...  Oh, you rolled, man.  This one's called the Opie and Anthony.  Yes. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, shit.  What is it?  Two pines with nothing inside?  Great.  And you can Opie and Anthony.  Really?  It's a chicken cutlet, melted provolone, great combination.  Spicy suppressata.  Oh.  In Brooklyn, we call it supersad.  Sure.  And sliced hot stuffed peppers.  Holy fuck, that's not good.  Are they all hot?  Some of them are hot, some of them are cold.  We brought some non-meat options because...  Yeah, because, you know, we have a few fruits that work here. 
[02:25:00]  Oh, the vegetarians are...  No.  If you're eating, you might as well eat.  And this is not on our menu yet, the Maestro.  This is named after my brother.  He's one of these crazy sandwich guys who has to have all the combinations right.  Uh-huh.  So this is in the test run right now at our store, and it'll probably be on our next menu.  Chicken cutlet, mozzarella, bacon, and sweet barbecue sauce.  E-Rock, you start.  Choose the one you like.  E-Rock, choose your weapon.  What do you got yours?  I got the Phil Rizzuto.  Oh, the scooter. 
[02:25:30]  What's that?  It's nice.  Roast beef, fresh mozzarella, lettuce, mayo, salt and pepper.  He just treats himself.  Where's the cold ones?  Let's see what we have here.  Uh, the 16 is a cold one.  Okay.  Uh, we have two opium anthony's in here.  Okay.  We need to save a little food.  I just want to have a bite of one.  I'm not going to do much.  This is Sam Roberts.  It's just full of bologna, and it's Limburger cheese, so it stinks.  It's full of bologna.  You're full of bologna.  This one here is very popular.  I see.  What's the popular one, Jimmy? 
[02:26:00]  Prosciutto, provolone, soppressata, I don't know what that is, capicola, mozzarella, bruschetta,  and balsami.  Is this all vegetables?  No, that's a lot of meat.  Oh, I just made, they mentioned eight meats.  I'm truly stupid.  There's no ham.  Oh, capicola, yeah.  Well, all of those are...  I have a call.  Okay.  Yeah, they're all pork products.  It might be too much.  Do you know Roland?  I just met Roland just now.  We had about a...  Just met Roland.  He's going to be your best friend.  Oh, yeah.  That's delicious.  Oh, yeah.  He's feeling heavy subs. 
[02:26:30]  He knows the food places, Roland.  We have his sandwich outside already.  Oh, that's good.  Really?  You deliver?  We deliver, yes.  We're actually in Manhattan almost every day.  I love that.  A lot of corporate stuff out here now.  I love a good delivery.  I do, too.  Yeah.  I can't believe you just said, I love a good delivery, and I actually said, I do, too.  Yeah, of course you do.  This is a lot of sandwiches.  A lot of sandwiches.  That's great.  What's left in the box, guys?  Well, so we have a Danny Aiello.  Oh. 
[02:27:00]  It's a grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, broccoli rabe.  Nice.  We have the doo-wop, which I just mentioned before.  We actually have a Joe Paterno.  Uh-oh.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  You're going to be changing the menu, huh?  The sandwiches on the chopping block.  It may get a name change.  I don't know.  What happens if the little meatballs are being abused and it turns around?  It comes with a question mark.  Is that a blindfold?  What's in the Joe Paterno?  Joe Paterno is a grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, fried egg plant with honey mustard. 
[02:27:30]  It's actually super popular.  Call it something, like, less controversial.  Like, the Hitler.  We have a super, super, super, super busy sandwich on the line.  The Marissa Tomei.  It's an eggplant sandwich.  Oh.  Oh, I thought that would have been someone else.  Fresh mozzarella.  What else on there?  It has mushroom stuffing on it.  Yeah, the Anthony Comia.  There you go.  Thank you.  But what's unique about our store is, instead of just making a traditional turkey sandwich, 
[02:28:00]  ham sandwich, we took all the ingredients that you might make a sandwich in your house.  Would you slice up banana peppers and put it on a sandwich?  Would you put ribbop there on top of meatballs?  And that's the type of sandwich shop that we built.  Nice.  Good for you.  You know, three, four different ingredients, five ingredients.  Some have eight ingredients.  But things you won't see in your traditional sandwich.  Iraq, why don't you take a bite?  A little bit.  Chaz Palminteri.  What's that?  That's a veal.  A veal palminteri.  Very popular.  A lot of our sandwiches are super popular. 
[02:28:30]  Our least popular is the Vinny Testaverde.  Oh, really?  He picked that sandwich when we met him.  It's an olive loaf.  Oh, jeez.  Of course.  You eat it, you choke.  And mayo.  Oh, that's terrible.  That is terrible.  I'm not an olive loaf guy.  Iraq loves olive.  Of course Iraq likes it.  Yeah, he loves it.  For real.  It's terrible.  Olive loaf.  Loaf fucking stinks.  Part of the name is what he does all day.  Exactly.  Olive.  Guy who doesn't get references.  Yeah, you know what? 
[02:29:00]  Give me a hero, I'll get right back to work.  There you go.  Come on now.  Should we take a break?  Yeah, five-minute break and take a break.  Leone, Brooklyn Italian Heroes.  I'm all about the plugola, so I have no problem helping you out here, sir.  I'm not supposed to say it.  What?  Fifth Avenue and 78th Street there?  Oh, 15th Avenue.  Sorry, 15th Avenue and 78th Street in Brooklyn.  Bensonhurst.  Bensonhurst.  God, it smells good, dude.  Have you been to the new arena?  Over there in Brooklyn.  All right. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  I'm a ghost, right?  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  I really appreciate it.  Absolutely.  You rock.  Fantastic.  I'm going to grab one of these during our little break here.  Yeah, we're going to try to eat a huge sandwich in three and a half minutes.  Three minutes.  Right.  What a rock.  What?  Oh, boy.  Look at Iraq.  Look how happy Iraq is. 
[02:30:00]  He's in his own element.  How good is the sandwich?  He's in his own elephant.  This is amazing.  This is amazing.  Which one do you have again?  The bread is important.  The one you have.  Got to have a good bread.  I got the Phil Rosendo.  Oh.  Brick oven bread.  Brick oven bread.  Brick oven bread.  It's all about that.  It's for his birthday.  You said that.  What's your birthday?  Yeah.  It's his birthday.  That's why you're here.  He rocks a cow.  Jesus.  That's so unnecessary. 
[02:30:30]  He got you the picture.  Jesus.  It just never ends.  Happy birthday, E.  I hope he chokes me.  I hope he chokes me.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Thank you, sir.  I really appreciate it.  Say hi to the gang in Brooklyn for us.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  If you've got a problem.

My wife and I thought we'd have enough to live comfortably and maybe do some traveling.

[02:39:00]  Sub sandwiches are the fucking best.  I love a good sub.  I like the way the broccoli rabe tastes on it.  Broccoli rabe.  But I like a cold sub.  Like, I like, uh...  I'm glad he didn't bring all cold subs.  I would eat a whole one.  Yeah?  Do you like this?  You know the cold ones with the vinegar and oil?  Oh.  Why am I explaining what a sub is?  Mingy.  Yeah.  I'm actually going, you know, with the bread, we got it, dummy. 
[02:39:30]  We know what a sub is.  Wow, this is good.  Yeah, it's fucking phenomenal.  You rock.  Hey, Rock, it's your birthday.  I know.  Oh, God.  He's eating.  Mmm.  Mmm, mmm, mmm.  It could be the worst break in the middle of history.  Ha, ha, ha.  We can't throw sandwiches in front of us and expect us to talk.  I know.  And Sam, who's like a fucking tyrant, refused to give us more time. 
[02:40:00]  He really is a slave driver.  How did you become a slave driver?  Yeah.  We used to get our coffee.  What the fuck happened?  Somebody's got to make you guys do a show.  Really?  And that's somebody as you?  That's right.  I'll take on the responsibility.  I'm the man to do it.  I've had it.  That's great.  That's fucking good. 
[02:40:30]  I was just eating.  Fuck it.  I can't tell you what to do once the show's on.  That's true.  That is true.  I was asking Roland how Mikhail Moroni smelled.  So she smelled good.  And her hands were really soft.  That's impossible.  I know.  You think like on that parallel bar.  Although they wear those things on their hands, right?  I don't know.  Yeah.  How do you hand soft?  I wear gloves when I do certain exercises in the gym because it fucks your knuckles up. 
[02:41:00]  All that rosin.  Not your knuckles.  I'm sorry.  The inside palm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're right here.  It gets like all calloused.  You were saying you do like a fuckload of pull-ups.  Yeah.  We got to get a pull-up bar in here.  I want to see Jimmy in action.  I'll film him.  You're like a little monkey, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like a madman.  Yeah, but you know, when the pressure's out, I'll do two and my arm will hurt.  I'll go, ah, I can't go to her.  Because the pull-up is very difficult. 
[02:41:30]  Yes, it is.  Excuse me for chewing and I have a...  All right.  Did you say chewing?  Fuck that.  Enough with that guy.  Ben Stein.  Oh, by the way, yes, the six has been found, apparently.  It has?  Yes.  Whoa.  The six has been found from Power 96.  It's no longer Power 90. 
[02:42:00]  Look, see, it's back.  Wow.  Thank God.  Oh, boy.  Thanks.  You want to see it?  She's a $10,000 winner?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  What happens?  Oh, dear.  Get it beautiful.  Some woman sitting on a bench.  Now some slob is walking up to her and talking to her.  This is all hidden camera stuff.  I guess the station.  People are in a vehicle.  Uh-oh.  Oh, my God. 
[02:42:30]  And now she's saying, are you the...  That's it.  That's it.  It's like a fucking bust.  Why didn't they mic that lady?  Why didn't they have a mic?  Fucking assholes.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to run.  Now they're walking up to her with a camera.  My kids are like, mommy, you're crazy.  I'm like, $10,000.  I'm not crazy.  My kids, I was thinking of the school.  Are you okay?  Are you okay?  All right.  $10,000 after taxes. 
[02:43:00]  You're going to be crazy.  Oh, my God.  Right here.  Oh, good.  Oh, my God.  Fat lady one.  Yeah.  A big pig one.  And no one cares.  Of course.  Oh, my goodness.  You can trust your mom, man.  Oh, my goodness.  Could you plug this for one second?  You've never seen...  I have no one there.  ...less fanfare.  This is nothing.  There's no one there.  No one's there.  This woman's just rambling on.  There's a couple of interns around her, I guess.  But they got their six back. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, thank God for that.  It's the dumbest video ever.  They don't even have a wireless mic on the fucking lady.  No.  They didn't give her permission.  I bet you that was a lawyer thing.  Oh, there was probably a lawyer thing.  Well, they could have recorded it and then just not aired it.  Yeah, they're probably just idiots.  I think they're idiots.  Oh, my God.  That was horrible.  Wouldn't it be funny if they did it, like, in a way that got them in such trouble?  Like, they waited until there was, like, a domestic murder.  And then the radio van showed up. 
[02:44:00]  And they said that she was brutally raped.  And we found our six in her vagina.  They thought that would be great to tie in a local story.  No, it wouldn't.  They would get in trouble.  And there they are presenting the giant check.  So you think your mommy's crazy?  No.  No.  Oh, my goodness.  What am I going to do?  It's really not enough for what I need to do.  So I just tried to do that.  Oh, it's not enough?  Now she's once more gives me that?  No.  She needs to fucking eat.  That's why.  Yeah, it's true. 
[02:44:30]  Well.  Munch.  Oh, I've had it.  Videos do a while, though.  Oh, how many views?  A lot, right?  1,600.  1,600 reviews.  Oof.  Oh, look at this.  The top comment from 10 hours ago is,  E-Rock Army, nigga.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And then the other one, ha, ha, ha, ha.  90% of the views will be O&A fans.  Hack.  Fucking hack.  Radio station.  Oh, wow.  Oh, no.  You pest are vicious.  LOL Ramon. 
[02:45:00]  Oh.  Feet up on the board like I run this show.  Hoagie in my mouth.  Hoagie in my mouth.  E-Rock Army, nigga.  E-Rock, E-Rock.  That boy in the chair, bikini girls on the screen,  Coke floats in my cup, Coke floats in my cup.  You're saying a lot of the people that saw it,  a lot of those views are O&A.  Oh, this is probably one of their station listeners.  So where's the six?  Did that fatty eat the fucking thing?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  These people are messes. 
[02:45:30]  That pig could stand to lose a few numbers herself.  Wow, that's not nice.  Prize pig, prize pig, prize pig, prize pig.  They're all of them.  They're all of them.  Iraq, you got your song for your birthday?  I'm looking for it.  Iraq.  Sam El Mulatto.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  No, that's you.  And we do have audio of the parents of the transgendered kid.  Oh, yeah.  That's a weird story.  This is a weird fucking story.  Yeah, I don't know how to feel about this. 
[02:46:00]  A little strange.  I don't know much about it.  You got Iraq Army nigga?  Yep.  You just play that for your birthday.  And then we'll go into this thing.  God, if he got fired on his birthday.  Oh, what's going on here?  Yeah, there you go.  It ain't working.  Cool.  Iraq.  Iraq, what are you doing?  Iraq.  File's fucked up.  You're on your way out.  File's fucked up.  Yeah, that's fine.  He doesn't know what song you're like.  No, he doesn't.  So what is this story?  You got a transgendered kid.  He's six.  Six years old? 
[02:46:30]  You know that at six years old?  No, I don't know, man.  No, that's just it.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Now, of course, I think most of you know...  What's transgendered?  Which one is that?  I think it's...  You think that you are...  Or maybe you are.  The opposite sex...  Yeah.  Excuse me.  It's a weird in-between thing.  They said the kid identifies with girls more than boys.  So they're raising the boy as a girl, even though he still has his little boy parts.  But it's not just you say you are.  Or I think it's more like they really... 
[02:47:00]  They just know?  I don't know what it is, man.  I don't know.  It seems a little young for...  It does seem young to kind of twist it around.  Complicated shit like that.  Yeah.  They all say that, you know, from a very young age, though, like, I knew that this is who  I was and this is...  Which one is him?  With the purple hair.  Yeah, but I mean, he's dressed like a girl, so...  Wait, which one?  He didn't reach puberty yet, so...  In the middle?  No, with the purple hair.  Not the red hair.  The one on the end.  The one on the right.  With the pink dress on.  Yeah, that looks like a girl, but that's a boy?  I disagree, though.  I disagree that they should be able to use the... 
[02:47:30]  That's a girl or a boy?  That's the boy.  Boy or a boy identifies as a girl.  Identifies as a girl.  But that's sex.  Correct.  And when did this all start?  A couple years ago?  Yeah.  Yeah, they got...  They explained it at a press conference.  The other girls, though, the problem is, you can't infringe on their privacy because you  identify a certain way.  Like, if they should give this kid access to the teacher's bathroom or something that's  single, that's fine.  Yeah, something like that, right?  Right?  Yeah, maybe.  Can someone explain this? 
[02:48:00]  It's like, how does this sound?  I'm really confused.  Yeah, they know.  Because the kid just seems way too young to be making such harsh decisions.  They know.  They put him into bed, and he would start crying and just punch his little penis.  You kidding?  Yeah, of course.  Well, I don't know.  Sometimes.  They're punching it.  The mom said she took the kid to, like, the kid got depressed, like, at this young age.  And, like, took him to...  She said medical whatever.  I'm assuming it was a therapist.  Yeah.  And the therapist said, yeah, he's transgender. 
[02:48:30]  Some crazy fucking therapist.  But is it...  Here's the thing.  Because it's kind of a newer thing that's talked about, is it crazy and somebody just identifying  themself wrong and mental wiring being fucked up?  Or is it actually a legitimate...  You know what I mean?  It's like, that's the question.  Is it, like, a legitimate thing?  Like, no, transgender people have always existed, just never been identified properly.  I don't know.  Where is this?  Seattle.  I don't know.  It's way off. 
[02:49:00]  Interesting.  So we should get Bailey J on the phone.  Oh.  Well, let's play the mom explaining when they realized their kid was transgender.  We started noticing when Koi was about 18 months, as soon as she could express herself,  that she was really expressing that she was a girl.  And...  Holy shit.  That seems young, man.  It's weird.  18 months, they're starting to... 
[02:49:30]  These parents are fucked up.  You don't express yourself as a gender when you're that young, dude?  Not really.  You really don't.  Not so much.  Oh, my God.  My dad would have had me in a fucking dress...  Right.  ...in a second.  Little faggot I was.  Jesus.  Imagine you're transgender, but you're just blocking it because of everything you're damn  did.  Oh, my God.  Little Anthony was a transgender man.  Oh, no.  Transgender.  That's why you were crying and scared all the time.  All the time. 
[02:50:00]  How great would it be?  We just opened his eyes.  He comes in near Monday fully dressed as a girl.  Where is it, girl?  Oh, my God.  And he's crying when he lost his beautiful years.  Guys, I...  He prefers to be called Ann.  Yeah.  I had an awakening.  I'm not Ann.  I had an awakening because of Friday's show.  I'm Ann.  I hope you respect what I've decided to do.  It's not going to change anything.  It's going to come in in really slutty outfits.  Hi.  Yeah.  No, that's...  I'm going to move out to Arizona to a warmer climate where it's better for my skin. 
[02:50:30]  And I...  Yeah, I identify with a woman now.  I'm Ann.  No more guns.  No more racism.  It's all just a cover-up for this transgender thing.  Oh, you think it's all that?  I do.  I do.  I do.  Oh, man.  I do.  Opie and Antoinette.  Antoinette.  Ann Cumia.  Tight little slutty miniskirts.  Oh, yeah.  And I dress like...  I go way over the top, so I'm dressing like a slut.  Who's that?  Wow.  Who's that chick?  That's...  Here she goes.  Who the fuck is that bitch? 
[02:51:00]  Who is that?  Who's the red-headed ship?  I don't know.  Get that fucking bitch in here!  Is that Marie Osmond or something?  I don't think it's Marie Osmond, no.  No.  She looks like Sandra Bullock from the side, but it wasn't Sandra Bullock.  There'd be a whole bunch of fanfare.  Yeah, there wasn't a lot of people around that one.  The girl from the bus.  No, it wasn't Sandra Bullock.  No, it wasn't.  Who was it?  You're a lady.  I'm a lady.  I think so.  I'm not a...  I don't think I am.  That would be hilarious, though, coming in.  It would be, right.  And I just don't even know how to dress like classy. 
[02:51:30]  No.  I'm a cougar.  Oh, you'd be such a dirtbag with fucking slut red lipstick.  That'd be horrible.  You'd put it on wrong.  You'd put it on like a guy.  You'd start inviting E-Rock to come over to your house to help you with, like,  household things.  No, no.  Bend over a little more.  You see the guy in our neighborhood?  He walks around like a woman, and man, does he own it.  And he gives the feeling that if you even say a word, you're going to get your ass kicked.  Is he a homeless guy or no?  No, not that guy.  This guy is, like, he's tall. 
[02:52:00]  He wears, like, fucking one of those hats like he's from Bahrain or something.  Bahrain?  Like one of those weird, like, roundy hats.  A fez?  I wouldn't call it.  Nah, maybe.  Hey!  Maybe sort of like a fez.  He walks around on the Upper West Side.  He fucking owns it, man.  And he's quite scary.  And he seems like he's, like, has an important job or something, too, which I just would love  to ask him one question. 
[02:52:30]  That was her.  Yeah.  What was that?  Roma Downey.  She's an actress, and she's Mark Burnett's wife.  Oh, yeah, Mark Burnett's here.  Yeah, Mark Burnett.  I'm sure Mark Burnett was next to her.  Oh.  What?  The Mark Burnett?  Yeah.  Who used to do our show, too?  Yeah.  Well, how about we get him in here?  I have a word or two with him.  I don't think so.  We probably could have.  He used to do our show all the time.  I know.  I think he's promoting a Bible miniseries.  Yeah, that's going up on the...  Oh, that's a big thing going on, man.  So why would he do our show?  Did you turn him down?  I wouldn't turn Mark Burnett down. 
[02:53:00]  A, he's good radio, and we used to have him on a bunch of times.  Roland, what's the word?  I absolutely would not have turned down Mark Burnett.  And did you turn him down?  We weren't.  I don't remember being offered Mark Burnett.  I don't recall it.  Do you feel slighted?  Yes.  I'm feeling slighted.  Do you think it's because of who you are in your recent announcement that there's been prejudice displayed against you?  I think people are looking at me a little strangely now, and I think they just ought to get over it. 
[02:53:30]  Ugh.  Anthony just becomes like Fez.  I'd be all defensive.  Everything is an issue with transgender.  Everything now.  You know, the transgendered community.  I take all the fucking passion I put toward pistols.  Yeah.  And turn it into rights for the transgendered.  Well, you'd have a friend on this radio show.  Oh, God.  Hmm?  Nothing.  What do you mean?  I didn't say anything.  If people are willing to accept me as I am, I'm a woman. 
[02:54:00]  I'm a woman.  Watch what happened  You did mention Fez's name is the only thing  It just sounded familiar  No, you said the hat  I said what about the hat  I was talking about that guy  It's a hat  Here's the parents talking about their kid  They knew at 18 months old  That's very fascinating to me  I wonder if we can get some fucking people to call in on this topic 
[02:54:30]  I knew it my whole life, Ma  We started noticing when Koi was about 18 months  As soon as she could express herself  That she was really expressing that she was a girl  And, you know, of course at that time  Our thought was that she was a little boy that liked girls' things  Fucking grudge  And it wasn't until she started becoming depressed and anxious  That we knew that there was something more going on  And took her to medical professionals  Who then, you know, told us that she did 
[02:55:00]  She was, in fact, transgender  Cigars and scotch  They knew because he kept putting the bottle up his ass  That's fucking funny  Yeah  You're a nasty motherfucker  Wait, no  Wait  He kept taking the bottle and going, look, it's a peck of  He's coming to the last joke  Oh, God  How embarrassing is Chip  How do you think so? 
[02:55:30]  Is that comfortable?  Because you picture someone really doing that  Horrible  Destroying everything  Wait, wait, wait  Yeah, just  So the kid was like two years old and depressed  Yeah, the parents seem like  How do you tell if a two-year-old's depressed?  Well, a lot of times they start crying  And every time you walk in, they pretend to be sleeping  Liars  Maybe that's it  Sure  The parents seem to be on top of this  Yeah  They seem uber aware  They have a bunch of kids  That's weird, man  The transgender kid was one of triplets 
[02:56:00]  So these three at the top of the page are triplets  Oh, okay  Adorable  They got their eggs  Easter egg colors  Pink  And everything was going really well  She was in kindergarten at Eagle Side  And everything went wonderfully there  She finished kindergarten and did first grade there  And everything was going well in first grade  And then out of the blue, the school contacted us 
[02:56:30]  To tell us that they were going to be changing  And she was not going to be allowed to use the girls' restrooms anymore  I don't necessarily think she should  Because, again, the other little girls  Their parents are reasonable if they go  Look, we're not comfortable with this  It's just not something  They confuse the kids  Yeah, we don't  It's like, I understand  It's not just about the cock or the breast  It really isn't  But  As a parent, you have the right to not want your little six-year-old daughter  Using the bathroom with somebody with a cock 
[02:57:00]  I don't  I really think  The exception you could make  For a genuine transgender kid  Is, for now  Allow them to use  One of the adult places  It's a single stall  Or a handicapped  Whatever  Yeah, find a bathroom for her  For now  Yeah  I don't know how it feels  It's just weird  It's like, you know  A lot of parents want to like that shit  Yeah, I don't know  Why don't they have sexual reassignment surgery  At that young age  So it just fucking, you know  Some of them don't want it  Sexes, everything  Like Bailey 
[02:57:30]  I think Bailey said  That she doesn't want her to get cut off  Yeah, but it's the fucking kid  What the hell do they know?  Just wake up the next morning  Like, all right  I got a fucking pussy now  I don't care  Cut that shit off  Yeah, cut that shit  The mom explains the school's harassment in this clip  Her ass  And that really just was not a safe environment for her  That set her up for a lot of issues at school  For bullying and harassment  It wasn't a place that we were able to let her be  Because we want her to be safe  And we want her to be healthy  And so we've temporarily withdrawn her from school 
[02:58:00]  And so we can reach a resolution with the school  And we have filed the complaint with the school  And we're hoping that, you know  That they will change their minds  And they will come back and teach that  You can love somebody  And you can accept somebody  Even if they are different  And it's okay  That's not the point  That's not the point  Thank you  It's not about loving  Oh boy  They are going to have a fuck of a discrimination case here  It's not about loving  It's not  They're gearing up  There's obviously a lot of confusion in that school 
[02:58:30]  People are confused  They don't fucking know what to do  It's not about not loving your kid  Exactly  You can't throw that into this  She just threw it in out of nowhere  Yeah, well that's again  That's because she's a parent  People feel uncomfortable  Because they don't understand  They're five, six, six year olds  Yeah  Kid's born with a pecker  It's a boy  Stop  Holy fuck  Your kid's  I would assume  Is loved at the school  I don't know  But they're confused  They don't know what to do 
[02:59:00]  They're just trying to do the best  I got one  You got one?  Oh my god  Yeah, how they knew it was a transgender baby  Yeah  Because every time that  See my hands were rattling  She was like shoving up my butt  And going, look at this  Holy shit  Oh my god 
[02:59:30]  That's just the worst  That is so bad  Oh, good  You know what?  You know what?  One of the kids a kid  What the hell do I know?  You're transgendered  Transcontinental for all I know  You get me a container of coffee  And you give me the carpentry stuff I need  I get the job done  I don't know about the rest  You build an extra bathroom  What do you want from me?  Oh  Well, that's pretty open-minded  For regular Joe  No, no  I mean for me  Because I'm busy on this site  I don't got time to wait  For little girls, little boys  I don't know what the heck you are 
[03:00:00]  All I know is who I am  I'm just Joe on the job site  That's all I know  Of course you are  Get my lunch pail  Lunch pail  I hate Joe  You think he's an idiot?  Regular Joe stinks  On the job site  Thinks everything revolves around the job site  You do that at home, though?  Oh, constantly  I can't stop  Do you know the joy  That like an odor  These things permeate my friends' lives  Yes  Do you know the joy that is?  I can't stop doing it 
[03:00:30]  I see something on TV  I just start commenting on the commercial  The commercials  Ah, this isn't that  Like tampon commercials  Are, you know, inappropriate  This shouldn't be  Back in my day, you know, growing up  Did your girl get annoyed with it?  Oh, everywhere  Yes, of course  It's terrible  Eh  It's like  Shut up  Somebody even if they are different  And it's okay to be different  And that's what makes you special  I mean, really  In the end  We just want what is best for the boy  In the end  We want her to have the same opportunities  As all of our other children 
[03:01:00]  And we want her to be able to go back to school  And be treated equally  Without discrimination and harassment  That's not harassment  That's not harassment  That's not harassment  That's a little different  Than being treated equally  Hmm  Yeah  You got a penis  And you go into the girl's bathroom  That makes parents uncomfortable  And other kids uncomfortable  Yeah, if they're saying  I'm not saying it's wrong  I don't think it's wrong  But it's an issue where it's uncomfortable  If you're saying you're transgender  They say that that's not the same as being a woman 
[03:01:30]  So then you should not be entitled to use the woman's bathroom  Because technically that's not the same as a woman  They say that that's a different thing altogether  That's why I texted Bailey  I was wishing she'd be up to call in  And like, how old were you?  I would love to ask her  Oh, yeah  And what do you think?  Because she's pretty centered  Why don't they just get her like a spackle bucket  And tell her to go out and back  Go shoot her, man  Yeah  And they all point and laugh at her  They say carry things from the movie  Uh-huh  You know what?  In this world we live in  It's all about soundbites  That was a joke 
[03:02:00]  Oh, is that it?  Yes  Yeah, it is a soundbite kind of world  Of course that would be a soundbite-y thing  Oh, yeah  That sandwich, wow  Mmm  Tasty  I just don't know  Like, is it possible to identify at that young age?  Maybe it is  I mean  I don't know  I think the parents should have maybe given the kid a little longer  To maybe assimilate to the male fucking side there  I don't know  You know  But at that angle  You're not thinking about dating other people, I don't think  You're not thinking about sex  You're not thinking about who you like 
[03:02:30]  So, I mean, what is it that enables people to identify?  Why would you identify with a girl?  Yeah, what is it?  Dolls?  Is it because you  Maybe because  It's stupid for the parents to  So early  Pull the trigger on this whole thing  And raise the kid as a girl  Seems a little young  Well, they're triplets, right?  Yeah  It's a boy and two girls, technically?  Yeah  Technically  I mean, it's a transgender thing  But is it possible?  Well, no  It's two  Born biologically  Two boys  One girl  Gotcha  Two boys and a girl  No, two girls and a boy, right? 
[03:03:00]  Two girls and a boy  One in the middle is a boy, right?  They were born  Two boys and a girl  Okay  The one in the middle is a boy, too  Which one is a boy?  Oh, really?  The one on the right was born biologically a boy  This is the kid we're talking about here  Oh, I thought the one in the middle was the fucking girl  No, no  Oh, God  So, okay  No, they're all in, making her look like a girl  Her hair is long  Is it possible that at that age with triplets  That's what I was thinking, too  You identify more with one and you think, I'm her and I'm not him  How do triplets see each other and themselves? 
[03:03:30]  They have weird relationships compared to, like, regular siblings  So, could that be, like, could that be a common confusion that mixed-gender triplets have?  Where one identifies with one and not the other?  Parents seem responsible and it seems like they're on top of it  And they understand something's up here  They seem like weirdos  Yeah, I think strict punishments needed to be  I don't know, but to put it all on the school, like, not loving your kid  I don't believe that  No, that's 
[03:04:00]  At all  This looks like one of these Munchausen fucking syndrome by proxy things  Where the woman, the mother, apparently likes this type of attention  Likes what goes along with it  And that's what she's going to do  And instead of feeding the kid fucking Drano  And getting the hospital thing  And making that her life  She does it this way  Yeah, I mean, you want to talk about harassment for having to use a different bathroom  How about plastering her kid all over national television? 
[03:04:30]  Right  Hey, you guys don't think that the kid's transgender?  I don't know, but at that age, you should give the fucking biological portion a little more time  Perhaps it's a phase the kid was going through that  Maybe you'd like to put on mommy's shoes  Six isn't even long enough yet  There's no real fucking  18 months to six, though, they've been dealing with this  But 18 months was too early to start dressing the kid and treat him like a girl  So now you think the kid  So now the kid's just used to it  Just used to it? 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, I mean, if you start dressing at two years old  If you start dressing a kid  That's all you know  Get the kid longer than 18 fucking months  Let his little testes come in and see what the fuck he says  I may have an expert on the phone in just a moment for our hotline  Let's play the last clip as the phone rings here  Every father has a vision of what they want their son to be like  But in this case, Coy is a girl  And just the transformation and the blossoming of her  And being able to be herself and who she really is  I don't want to miss that 
[03:05:30]  I don't want her to grow up and regret such a horrible childhood that she might have  And so whatever is best for Coy  And I love her so much  That's just all I want to see  You know what?  Good for him  Yeah, he's obviously a loving parent  This little girl, little boy could have been born to some real shitty fucking parents  So good for him for being open-minded and trying to figure it out for his kid  I don't know what to make of this  That's my final statement  Because it's so confusing  Say hi to Belly J 
[03:06:00]  Belly J!  Hey!  Hi, Belly  I sound like Miley Cyrus right now  No, that's alright  You don't see another story we're doing?  I assume so  It's the transgender kid I keep hearing about  Every person has sent me an email about this  I would imagine  Yeah, and the parents want the kid to be able to use  Want her to be able to use  They're triplets  There was apparently two  You know, a boy, a girl  And then, I don't know  You know, transgendered  Is it a boy or a girl?  And then they want  Parents want this kid to be able to use the girls' room 
[03:06:30]  And what do you  Well, wait, hold on  Let me ask the first question  They say that they knew their kid was transgender at 18 months old  Okay  In your experience, does that seem like it's a little too young to really understand what's going on?  Well, it's weird because my instinct is to say you can't know until you're an adult  But if I'm going on my own experience  I knew when I was five  I told my mom  And she was like, okay, you're full of shit  I'm signing you up for T-ball  And so  What did you tell her? 
[03:07:00]  What did you tell your mom?  It was actually  I remember exactly what I said  I told her I was mad at God  Because he was supposed to make me a girl  And so I told her I wasn't going to pray anymore  And so she  But so she basically thought I was out of my mind  And pushed  But I think that's also kind of a normal reaction  If a parent reacts that way  But what told you that, though?  Like, what internally  Like, what do you remember thinking or feeling like  This is not the way it is? 
[03:07:30]  Or this is wrong?  It was  Well, basically because there were boys at school  And then there were girls at school  And I was like, oh, I'm obviously one of the girls  Like, everybody thought I was a girl anyway  I was really small  My voice was really high  I'm like, everybody thinks I'm a chick  And I want to go play with Barbies  And hang out with the girls  Because they're awesome  And these guys are kind of gross  So it was just  I kind of like  I knew then  I don't know  I feel like you know, though  Because I knew when I was five  Like, I totally knew  Yeah  Well, we're more wondering 
[03:08:00]  About 18 months  Seems way too young  But now  Now this  Transgender  Girl  How do you say it?  I don't even know how you say it  Girl, I guess  I guess a transgender girl  Would be a  Okay  Trans  Transgender girls  Future Norton girlfriend  Future Norton girlfriend  Is now six  So what do you think  Like, when you're that young  Should this  Girl or this kid  Be allowed to use the girls room  But if you're saying it's different  Like, you're not a girl 
[03:08:30]  You're not a boy  Like, do transgender say  Like, we're totally  We're a third  Gender  Or what do they  I don't understand it  I mean, I think  I think there's no  Universal trans experience  As stupid as that might sound  But, like  Everybody kind of  Has their own thing  I definitely  She should be using  The girls bathroom  As opposed to the boys bathroom  For her own safety  Because she looks like  A little girl  And, um  And, and  Because what is she gonna do?  Bang a bunch of other  Six-year-old kids?  Like, she's a little kid  She can use  She can use the other bathroom 
[03:09:00]  She's not gonna rape anybody  Like, it's ridiculous  You know what?  You just turned me on  The whole thing  The school's gotta relax  Just let her use  The fucking girls bathroom  Who cares?  Especially when they do  All their business  In the stall anyway  It's not like  It's not like  She's gonna whip out  Her little, little penis  Because she is a  A boy by birth  And, and  Peel over everything  With his little dog  I don't agree  I'll tell you why  Because the school's position  Is, like  What if  Let's just say  This kid's a little  A weird kid 
[03:09:30]  Who is a voyeur  Transgender  You can still be a voyeur  Let's say this kid  Starts looking under stalls  At little girls peeing  For whatever reason  Just to see what they're doing  Because, uh  Then the school would be in trouble  The transgender kid  Feels different  And wants to see how they do it  So she could do it the same  You know what?  I'm with Jimmy  Then the school's in trouble  Because the parents are like  You violated our little girls rights  To have an all girl experience  In the bathroom  It's like  It's a really weird  But to Belly J's point  Uh  The  If she went into the  Boy  She  I'm just gonna say she 
[03:10:00]  Went into the boys room  She'd absolutely be harassed  Because she looks like  A little girl  I agree  So you know what?  I gotta go with Belly J  Oh man  Gotta  I can see it from both sides  It's a huge liability  But obviously  You know I didn't think about lawyers  You know what?  I gotta go with Jimmy  Yeah  These stories happen all the time though  I mean this is the third one  I've heard of recently  Where a kid  Couldn't use the bathroom  And the people that make  A big stink out of it  Are Christian organizations  Bathroom  In public schools  Which is ridiculous 
[03:10:30]  Why can't they just have  Another bathroom?  Yeah  An alternative bathroom  Because we don't really  Socialize in the bathroom anyway  We're just  Well speak for yourself  We're just dropping duties  And getting the hell out of there  A single store somewhere  They have those in Europe  They have gender neutral bathrooms  In colleges and stuff  Because transgenderism  Is so accepted  In other parts of the world  Wow Europe  Yeah  They're crazy  But when you just walk  Into one of those  Going  I'm transgender  That's right I am  Yeah  So you get to see some boobies  I just like to think 
[03:11:00]  That girls get completely naked  When they have to go to the bathroom  Yeah right  That's why their boobies  That's going on  It's always sexy  It's always sexy  It's always sexy  Even a big fucking deuce  And at any moment  You think they might just  Start lezzing out in there  Right  So you gotta be in there  Scissoring  Scissoring  Bumping donuts  Yeah  The girls bathroom  Ruins the whole mystery  I promise  I use the girls bathroom  And I do not want to  Have sex with women  Alright let me ask you this  Wow  You're an adult  Have you ever had a problem  Being in a girls bathroom 
[03:11:30]  Has anyone ever called you out on it  I mean obviously  We've all seen you  And you certainly  You certainly looked the part  But I mean has anyone  I look like a chick  And I don't like  Piss in the sink or anything  Right  Nobody gets on my case  It was weird though  Because I mean I'm like  When I started using  The girls bathroom  I'm like I thought this place  Was supposed to be cleaner  Than the guys bathroom  It's like disgusting  It takes forever  There's like a tampon receptacle  I'm like  This is fucking gross  So using the boys bathroom  When you were growing up  Was there ever times 
[03:12:00]  Where you felt like  Where you got harassed  Or bothered  Did people kind of know  Well yeah  It was weird  They came across as a chick  As opposed to like  Some fag  So they were  Boys were really protective  Of me  And we were  Look  We got transgender people  That are tweeting at me  I didn't know we  We had a few out there  Well  We welcome all  Certainly  I don't know  If this person  Wants their Twitter  Promoter  But it says  It's not a choice  I knew in the second grade  Can I ask you though  This is what's curious  Because you said  Like you'd look at the girls  Behaving and talking 
[03:12:30]  A certain way  And  Oh  Sorry  Because I  Don't want these people  To think that  I don't think it's a choice  I think  Eventually  We're questioning  At what age do you know  I don't think it's a choice  I really don't  But is it  Like this is what I'm asking  This devil's advocate question  Is it possible that you  You identify more with the girls  Because there are men  Who are effeminate  Just like there are women  Who have more masculine qualities  Right  And is it possible  That someone who identifies 
[03:13:00]  Themselves as transgender  When they're really young  Is too young to realize  That no I'm not a girl  I'm just  I'm just a male  Who's very effeminate  And has more of these traits  Yeah  That's what makes it tough  Because I've had those same thoughts  Gender is a sliding scale  Masculinity  And femininity  Is a sliding scale  So you don't know  I am glad I waited  Until I was 18  But then a part of me wishes  My mom had listened to me  When I was 10  Or you know 6  Or whatever  Like as a kid  Because you can start  Hormone therapy at 13  And that can make your life 
[03:13:30]  A lot easier  In reference to  You know  Finding the right shoes  I think  I think the whole choice  And genetic thing  I think it's  A sum of both  I think it's like  You got your black gangsta  And then you got your wiggers  You know  You got people that  Obviously couldn't make the choice  And then people that  Kind of are drawn  To that lifestyle  And what not  And want to just be part of it  And act the part  Can I adjust my statement?  Sure  I think most of it 
[03:14:00]  Is not a choice  But I think  Oh absolutely  Most I think  You're right  I think you are right  I think there is a little wiggle room there  A little wiggle room  To maybe choose  A little wiggle room  Choose something  Lifestyle looks  Looks like something  You want to be part of  Or something  I think in general  It's not a choice  I mean deciding to transition  Or you know  Start your transition  That's definitely a choice  I guess maybe the urge  Is not  Can I ask you  To get a pair of them  Big fucking tits  Nice  Billie J  Can I ask you 
[03:14:30]  Do you have a good relationship  With your parents?  I do  I have a great relationship  Oh good for you  Yeah  Not with my father  But I'd like to think  That's not why I'm transgender  But I don't  I don't talk to my dad  But why?  You don't talk to him  Because of this  Or there was other  Family issues  Or whatever  No no no  He was the fuck up  I decided not to talk to him  He was like a crazy person  Oh okay  What would he do  That was crazy?  He was  Well when I was growing up  He had a  Give me a baseball bat  That's exactly where I was going  You went with the ball 
[03:15:00]  I was going to go  Yeah try to play catch  That's insane  He's like a junkie loser  But my mom's awesome  And my grandmother's awesome  And I've got good  Like good family members  And I've been like  Really supportive  Even though they're all  Like tea party  Or crazy people  So they're very conservative  But with you  They've been very  Kind of understanding  Yeah  Yeah because I look like a chick  If I was embarrassing the family  By looking like a chick  Right  Yeah you know  If it's like  Yeah some fucking  Just some dude 
[03:15:30]  With a wig on  That's  Right exactly  My grandmother basically  Just wants me to be hot  And marry well  Was like her only  She's crazy  Good for her  Yeah  So does she like your husband?  She does  Everyone likes my husband  I'm happy about  They've hated every boyfriend  I've ever had  And they like him  So it's good  Why'd they hate your other boyfriend?  Because they fucking suck  And I'm weird  In that charity case  I've never had the chance  To talk to you on the radio  I don't understand  Are you  So are you gay?  Is he gay?  Like how does that all work? 
[03:16:00]  Like break it down quickly  And that question  Makes less sense  And less sense  Every time someone asks me it  Because being gay  Is basically calling me a man  Which I don't identify as a man  Right  I understand that  You know whatever  I've never had a chromosome test  I could be a hermaphrodite  Because I don't have  Like really any body hair  Naturally  Like it's really weird  But I think if you're gay  You know you're gay  You want to have sex  With a bunch of fucking dudes  But if you want to have sex  With chicks  And then this one dude  That looks exactly like a chick  Then you're probably straight  All right 
[03:16:30]  I know  But you have the penis  So like does your  Jimmy Jensen  That's not really bad  Jimmy rules  All right  But your husband  Is he  Would he consider himself gay?  I think I already know  The answer to that though  It's kind of like  No because I'm  Very confused by the whole thing  I'm really  Trying to understand  The definition of gay  Is really misunderstood  Because it's like  It's okay  But a lot of straight guys  Would say the penis  Makes it gay  Right  But saying something  Doesn't make it a fact  True  True 
[03:17:00]  So it's  For me  And I'm not insulted  If the person I'm with  Would be considered gay  It wouldn't make me feel bad  Because we're actually  Very pro-gay rights  Even though neither of us  Feel that we're gay  We feel like a heterosexual couple  Except we have sex  So it's  It's weird  Like  Well Bailey  Did he date  Did Matt date men before you?  No  No but I'm saying  He was involved with women  And then met you  Of course  That's how they all start  I ruin their lives  Yeah  I've never  I've never hooked up  With a bisexual guy 
[03:17:30]  I've never  I've never hooked up  With a gay guy  Believe me  I would fuck the shit  Of a gay guy  They're adorable  But they do not  Want to have sex with me  They think I'm disgusting  So  Okay  Just confusing  That's all  Yeah but it is  It is definitely  Gay's a frame of mind  It's not just a dick  And you know  Two dicks  I understand  You know  Exactly  Exactly  Yeah  So it's  But I get that question  So  Alright how about  Alright I got another  These are all probably  Dumb questions  That you guys  Probably laugh at  But  Has he ever wished  You had a vagina  Um 
[03:18:00]  No because he  I mean  Like most guys  He likes anal sex  And fake tits  And I bring both  Of those things  To the table  Wow  Her answers  Her answers rule  But now  This is where people  But he doesn't miss a vagina  Right  Well you  No no no  I mean  Obviously  I assume  When he masturbates  He masturbates  To the same porn story  As everybody else does  With vaginas  But I mean  Who knows  When I'm 30  Maybe I'll get a vagina  They don't look terrible  I've seen pictures  They look  We saw one  It was horrendous  But then again  The lady was older 
[03:18:30]  So we know the surgery  Was a while ago  Remember that one  A lot  It's come a long way  Remember  Where we saw  Got that  Do you  But here's the thing  Where people would say  It's confusing  Like if you're  Like say you date women  And then you're hooked up  With a  You know  You meet a  A transsexual  A transgendered girl  But then you're having sex  But you're also  Doing like you know  Sucking the cock  It's like  Doesn't that make it  A gay activity  Or is that still part of 
[03:19:00]  I don't know  That is confusing  Why you have your fingers crossed  Jim  Believe me  You've never seen anybody  More nervous about an answer  I'm doing the  The Vegas dice thing  With my hand  Come on  No it's okay  This is called  The Curt Schilling  He has all his eggs  In one basket  I'm on the ledge  Answer correctly  Or I'm jumping  I think guys  Are a lot less afraid  Of dicks  Than they'd like you  To think  I mean all guys  Do is sit around  And take pictures  Of their dick  And play with their dick  And try to suck  Their own dick  For like 30 years  So it's like  Guys like dicks 
[03:19:30]  They finally meet  A hot girl  And they finally  Get to put a dick  In their mouth  Finally  Finally  Like that's what  Every guy's thinking  It's like finally  Fair enough  Fair enough  I didn't realize  You had a sense of humor  Very funny  Badly rules  Guilt free cock  Right  Is that it  I'm imagining  It's a girl  She just has a cock  Yeah  But it's also  Female energy  I'm sure too  Like you know  It's not  No I know 
[03:20:00]  I know it's a lot  More complicated  Than just saying  Oh penis gay  You know  But  Cause I've talked to  Girls about threesomes  With guys  Like watching them  Get fucked  To be hot  But I would much  Rather see them  Fuck a transsexual  Because that to me  Would be more  Of all  But they  Women get weirded out  By the idea of that  Because  It's the female energy  Right  That they can't compete with  Like they don't  Like they would fuck  Two guys  But they're afraid  If they have two cocks  And there's that  Other female energy  That they would be  I don't know 
[03:20:30]  Oh yeah women  Women hate me  I have terrible luck  With girls  They cannot stand me  Wow me and you  Have a lot in common  Oh Jimmy  They don't like me  Oh  Alright  Alright well  We're wrapping up  The show Bailey  But we wanted to  Get your expert opinion  Okay  Awesome  Alright thanks guys  Thanks  Talk to you soon  Take it easy  Thank you  Bye  Alright  Um  Yeah Bailey's  Uh  See very great  She says uh  Very funny  Yes  Mine's still open 
[03:21:00]  I liked her  There we go  And um  Yeah yeah  That's definitely uh  A unique situation  They almost figured out  That voice too huh  What Bailey's  Yeah  That's not just fucking  Like figuring anything out  That's been that voice forever  Yeah  Some hormones  To tell  Oh no  Really  Yeah  On the Friday show  You just listen to a room full of men  Asking questions  They didn't think they'd have to ask  As we eat sandwiches  Exactly  And thinking  You know what  I could fuck her in my hot tub 
[03:21:30]  Oh god  You think I  You think I would do that  My goal  Of course you would  My goal  Is to fuck  Of course you would  My goal  Is to get Anthony  The transsexual  Oh my god  Because he's such a kook  And such an obsessive lunatic  That house  Would be fucking  Sodom and Gomorrah  That would be  The last fucking straw  Before  God just puts a lightning bolt  Through the roof  I don't know  Show up around 2am  When he's had a few  I don't 
[03:22:00]  I don't think  I would  But he might be  A little weak  I'd be so afraid  Of that fucking cock  That's what I said  Yeah but you'd learn  To relax and take it  All I'd hear is  Jesus Christ  Son of a bitch  Yeah  Like oh no  It's okay  It's okay dad  Look  Looks like a girl  No but if you were taking it  And you were going  Ow ow  He'd be going  Jesus Christ  If you're going to  Take the cock  At least take it  And enjoy it  Son of a bitch

[03:25:30]  Steve Blatter  Came in here  To you know  I don't know  He was talking about  Something or other  Some kind of meeting  Keeping Opie and Anthony  From starting their weekends  But he made the huge mistake  Of using the word chip  Multiple times  Throughout the discussion  So just a whole bunch of  What's that  We're trying to accomplish something  What's that  Oh no  Let's do a line of the day  Since Opie and Anthony  Didn't get to it 
[03:26:00]  How many runners ups  Runners is ups are there  Gotta give me a moment  But there's three runners up  I don't gotta do anything  Just cause you're  Well then we don't play it  Just cause you're the birthday boy  Doesn't mean you're the boss  It has nothing to do with that  Hey Fez  How are you  Tell Fez I said hi too  Sam says hi Fez  Hi Sam  Oh  Nice  Alright  Give me a second  Let me go to 302  You're the first call  On After Opie and Anthony  Live today  How exciting for you  302  Yeah it is very exciting  It is very exciting  It's always a pleasure  To talk with you 
[03:26:30]  Thank you  It really truly is  But I've got to confess  That today it's not about you  As much as it pains me  To say this  It's strange  It is  It really is strange  That's why I haven't gone  Through my usual diatribe  Because after all  You are  The one and only  The Hollywood primetime  Sammy Sweetheart  The effing robbers  Professional broadcaster  Is this Larry  Yes it is of course  What are you at home  No I'm in the truck  In New Mexico  You sound really different  Maybe just because  You're subdued  I'm  Well I am subdued 
[03:27:00]  Because I really wanted  To wish the sex bagel  A happy birthday today  Because it's all about  The sex bagel today  How do you like that  Sex bagel  Thank you Larry  I appreciate that  If I may offer you a song  Yeah  Happy birthday  To you  I mean we're not going to  Hear him play the whole song  What the hell  I'm not going to listen  To the guy play the entire song  We got the gist  He's like your biggest fan  And he was doing something nice  I know but we got the gist  We know what he was singing  We got things to do today  I wanted to see how it ended  It ends very similarly 
[03:27:30]  To the way it begins  So you don't have to worry about that  How many runners up  Sizz are there today  We have three runners  Sizz up  Oh  How exciting is this  Alright let's go to the  Third runner up then  Okay  No gays  Why  Because I'm calling you gay  Oh  You're gay  So that was not  Not the line itself  But the explanation  Of the line  That became  Runner up line  Yes yes yes  Alright alright 
[03:28:00]  Let's go to second runner up  You know the best way  To color eggs  Is you put paint  On the inside  Of the hen's pussy  It's disgusting  I don't think that's true  I think that's not factual  Easter's right around the corner  Alright  The last runner up  Line of the day  The one that almost made it  I don't mean  Nothing illegal  It's just in God's eyes  You're disgusting  Who was that about  That was about Anthony  And Michaela  Oh  Well that was probably accurate 
[03:28:30]  How was that  Getting that  Material from her  I mean I was going to  Stick around and help you guys  Out with it yesterday  But I'm not going to  Wait around until  3, 3.30 in the afternoon  To talk to some  Olympic shrimp  Yeah her  She was running behind  On her schedule there  Yeah I'll bet she was  But she was very nice  Tell her to backflip her ass  In here on time  No scowls  Nothing  But that's not nice at all  That's all  The only thing people  Want to see is the scowl  She didn't scowl at all  No  I saw it rolling  You took a photo 
[03:29:00]  With her on Instagram  I was like oh  If you have a photo  With  What's her name  Michaela Maroney  And she's not making  The scowl face in it  What's the point  I don't know  You know  You might as well  Have taken a picture  With one of the  People who run track  Or something  You know  Still she's high  She's 17 rolling  Almost 18  Were you attracted to her  Well duh  Alright what's the  What's the  Runner up line of the day  That was the last runner up 
[03:29:30]  We did all three  Oh okay  Line of the day  Line of the day  Line of the day  The Phil Rizzuto  E-Rock's a cow  Jesus  So unnecessary  He got you  The picture  No shit Sherlock  Did you make it  About yourself today  Because it's your birthday  Or was that because 
[03:30:00]  Jim was laughing  About that joke  For an entire  Commercial break  Yeah that had to be  Oh E-Rock  You poor thing  You have big plans  For the weekend  Other than going to dinner  Or is that it  Dinner  People over  What people  Friends  Who  Of mine  Did you get invited  My wife's  Wait wait wait  You're having people  Over your house  For your birthday  Yeah  Like who  Like people  That we're friends with  Like who that I know  I don't think anybody  You know 
[03:30:30]  That got invited  Dave  You invited Eastside Dave  I don't  No I don't think  We did  What do you mean  You don't think  It's your birthday  You were invited  I was not invited  I was told you were  Where  To dinner  And to my place  On what medium  I don't know  I was told  You were  You were contacted  I didn't get any contact  I will find out  What happened  Oh Jenny Hut  Is she coming in  She just walked by  Jenny Hut's here  Roll and go grab her  Yeah go see if 
[03:31:00]  Jenny Hut wants to hang out  She's not doing anything  Important  Ever  And her show's over  Her morning show  Let's go to 765  You're on after  Opie and Anthony Live  She went the other way  Rowan  To the right  Hey Sam  What's up buddy  Hey man  Alright so I know  It was the line of the day  But what I learned today  Was that you can make  Jimmy laugh uncontrollably  Just by doing a  Phil Rizzuto voice  Saying you're on the count  It was a good line  It was well done  508  Hey I'd like to wish 
[03:31:30]  E-Rock a birthday  In his native tongue  Okay  Moo moo moo  Moo moo moo  You see that one coming  E-Rock  I dumped out of it  Did you see it coming  I heard  I figured it was coming  Yeah  We got show business  To talk about  We can't talk about  Your birthday all day  Is it the bus trip  No  I think the bus trip  Is going to happen though  Do you  I think it is  I mean  You rarely see management  Keep the charade on this long  That's right  You know  If it wasn't going to happen 
[03:32:00]  And we've had a lot  Of discussions about it  And the details  That we're getting into now  Really  I believe  The bus trip will happen  It's scheduled right now  To go down like  You know  End of April  Beginning of May  Type of time  You know  Who really knows for sure  But around then  We're saying like  Spring-ish  When it's going to be nice out  And stuff like that  We're not trying to  Get on a bus  And drive through the winter  No  And you know  Touring down in Dollywood  In Memphis  In Nashville  In Branson 
[03:32:30]  In Austin  And I mean  Based on the meetings  We've been having  And the details  That we've been getting into  I truly think  It's going to go down  I'm excited about it  Troy is very excited about it  He's on his cruise right now  But he's convinced  That he's going to make  Ant's party bus  Just the end all  Be all  Of party buses  I don't think  You know  Troy has been known  To hype things before  He talks a lot  And sometimes he delivers  And sometimes he doesn't  You all remember Chicago 
[03:33:00]  He was talking up a storm  Iraq  How much did Troy  Talk about Chicago  Beforehand I mean  He was saying  That this was going to be  Even better than Cleveland  Yeah  Like of epic proportions  But then again  He also talked about  Las Vegas that way  With Roland  And what did he do  In Chicago  He didn't come  He didn't even  Make it to the airport  Nothing went down  In Chicago  By the way  I got a message here  A text was sent to you  You probably just  Didn't get it  Yeah that's bullshit  That's not bullshit 
[03:33:30]  I get my text  Your wife's lying to you  No  I didn't get any text  You are  I know for a fact  You were on the list  No but you know why  Because she doesn't like me  Because I make jokes  About you sometimes  No she likes you  And she thinks  I'm a bad influence on you  She likes you  Because you make a lot of money  That's right I do  That's why she likes me  You need to have  Rich people around you  Yeah  But yeah I really do think  It's going to happen  Yeah and then  And then Troy was hyping up  This trip with Roland  Going out to Vegas  And then what happens  Roland goes to bed early 
[03:34:00]  You know what I mean  Yeah  So I'm not saying  Troy  And then Troy was sick  Right  Yeah yeah yeah  He was sick or whatever  I'm not saying Troy never delivers  Because you all heard the gay off  He delivered that day  There was a penis in the room  He delivered  However  There are many times  When Troy  Just doesn't pull through  And it's hard  To hype something up that much  So  We'll see how it goes  There was something  In the back office  I forgot who the discussion  Maybe it was involving you  Probably was  About who was going to have 
[03:34:30]  The first fight  On the bus  Were you part of that?  Maybe  What was the thought?  I heard the aftermath of it  But that it was going to be  Troy and Roland  To me I think  The most likely first fight  To happen on that road trip  Will be between Troy and Roland  Because I think Troy  Will be trying to encourage Roland  To party  Yeah  And to celebrate  And to  You know what I mean  And to not  To not pussy out  And I think Roland  Will have fun at first 
[03:35:00]  And then he'll get tired  Of the partying  But he'll keep doing it  Because Troy's asking him to  And then eventually  He'll just snap  And go crazy  I was just saying  I think on the road trip  Roland  Yeah  The first fight  My money's on  Would be between you and Troy  Yeah  He does  I told him  You can't  Overhype  Like Vegas  Right  That's what we were  Just talking about  You know he hypes  Like when you hype Vegas  Vegas  Will say  You know what  Fuck you  Same thing happened  On a road trip  Yeah  You can't hype it up 
[03:35:30]  Like that  Otherwise  He had to piss cruise  Very very much  Yeah  He said dude  When I walk on the  The minute I walk on the cruise  They all know  They all know  There's a fucking party going on  The beauty about this cruise  Is that he's just going on it  With his girlfriend  So even if nothing happens  He could just lie  You know what I mean  We'll never know  If it lived up to the hype or not  But the road trip  The bus tour  We'll be aware of that  Yeah  Because he said  A lot of things  We all know what he said  Partying  Bitches 
[03:36:00]  Bitches Roland  He said bitches  He said sleep  Is not even an option  It just  He said when the bus  Pulls over  When the bus pulls over  The first bus  Will get out  And go  What the fuck  Is going on  On the second bus  He said  That's what they're going to say  He won't  And sleep is not an option  For when  For anybody  In the party bus  No you can't sleep  For the whole five days  You cannot sleep  Well that's not going to happen  He's going to get tired himself  And just fall asleep  I know  Of course not  That's ridiculous  And he said  Dude we're not going to sleep  We're going to party hard 
[03:36:30]  There should be bad shows  I mean you're going to be  So tired of partying  By Wednesday  That nobody's got  Any energy left  But the thing is  I told him  How can you party  On the bus  While you're driving  11 hours  And you feel sick  Because you're drunk  And it's that emotion  Right  You're going to  Want to kill yourself  I'm telling you  He's going to encourage you  To party  And there's  You know  It's likely to be  A fight there  But that's not even  That's not the  Show business  In particular  That I was talking about  Our intern  He came  Oh 
[03:37:00]  Maybe before I get to that  Let me talk to you  Before I talk to you Alan  I'm going to talk to you Roland  Because a few months ago  There was  A block of programming  That went down  On this channel  On a Saturday night  Yeah  And it was  Roland's Food Court  And what was the other one called  Sexy with the Bagel  Or Bageling with the Sex  Bageling with the  Eric  Was it called  Bageling with the Sex  Yeah  That's what your show  Was called right  You named it that  No I did not  You were happy with the title though  No I wasn't 
[03:37:30]  You weren't  I didn't even want to do the show  Oh  Oh  This is so confusing to me  How do you  You don't want to do shows  I do  Just not right now  When  When I want to  I don't  Not when you decide  I'm going to  I'm going to  I choose  Not to go  What were you going to say  Go ahead Alan  I mean  E-Rock should just have a show  Where he just  Comes up with scripts  Every week  You like hearing about  E-Rock's movie  It's incredibly entertaining 
[03:38:00]  What do you think of that  E-Rock  I think that kid  Is fucking stupid  Okay  He said he thinks  You're stupid  Oh  That's not nice  This is what I don't understand  I keep hearing about  E-Rock's plans  For a podcast  He's built a studio  In his house  If you go down  To his basement room  He's got a little studio  That he set up for himself  Uh huh  But why don't  So why don't you want to do shows  I don't know  Are you scared  No I'm not scared  It's just  I know  It's going to be shit on 
[03:38:30]  Dude  Let me tell you something  Do you  Did you read  The Facebook  The Opie and Anthony  Facebook page  We talked about  The goofy  Harlem Shake  Parody video  That I made  We talked about it  On this show  Once we talked about it  You put it on the Facebook  As you do  For every video  We talk about  Correct  Uh yeah  Right  Did you read the comments  On that  No  They're all  First of all  They're all fucking morons  Except for 
[03:39:00]  A few of them  Almost all of them  Are fucking idiots  They're all like  I hope Sam dies  Sam's not funny  I don't know why  Sam's on the show  Do you know why  Sam's on the show  Because Opie and Anthony  Put him there  Your gods  Put him on the show  Once you trust  Their judgment  If you don't trust  Mine  Trust theirs  But I don't let it  Stop me from doing shit  Because they're idiots  Like they're just  The people who say that  Are saying that  Because they think  Opie and Anthony  And Jim 
[03:39:30]  Are going to read  Their comment  And laugh  And daddy will  They'll finally get  Daddy's approval  The people who have  An honest evaluation  Of it  I respect them  The people who  And it doesn't have  To be positive  But the people that  Aren't just  Recycling Norton jokes  And wishing death  I can respect that  But the vast majority  Are just doing  What they hear  Opie, Anthony  And Jim do  Thinking  That daddy's going  To laugh  And not realizing  That every time 
[03:40:00]  Opie and Anthony  And Jim  Do the Opie  Twitter voice  That's the guy  You're the dude  You're the guy  They're doing  Like and they're  Sitting there  Listening to their  Radios and laughing  At Opie, Anthony  And Jim  Making fun  Of them  You can't let that  Dictate what you do  You know what I mean  I used to get shit on  A lot more  Than I get shit on  Now  Did I not  You still do  How can I still  Get shit on 
[03:40:30]  A lot more  Listen to the phrasing  Of the sentence  Okay  I used to get shit on  A lot more  Than I do now  That's not to say  I don't get shit on  Now  I just did a whole  Rant about the  Idiots on Facebook  But  I used to get shit  On even more  I don't let it  Stop me from  Doing stuff  Because you can't  Control the audience  You gotta  You gotta  Put stuff out there  Pay no mind list  Put them on the  Pay no mind list  Rowan  The list that I 
[03:41:00]  Told you about  And how great  Is that list  Awesome  It's great  Put them on the  Pay no mind list  And then  Let your audience  Find you  You know what I mean  Let the people  Who actually have  A brain in their heads  Give it a true  Evaluation  And some of them  Are gonna like  What you do  And honestly  When you did  Bageling with the sex  People liked it  I got tweets  From people being like  That was a good show  That was a fun show  To listen to  You know what I mean  You're never gonna get  The full 
[03:41:30]  This show has a  Massive audience  Nothing that we do  Is going to get  That full audience  That full audience  Is given to  Opie and Anthony  And even they  Hate what  Opie and Anthony  Do  You know what I mean  There's a percentage  Of this audience  That listens to  This show  Every day  And you hear  They talk  They don't like  What Opie and Anthony  Do  It drives you  It's enough to  Drive a person insane  But you can't  Let them dictate  Whether or not  You're gonna do stuff  You'll be  You know  You'll be hiding  In your rabbit hole  Forever  If that's the case 
[03:42:00]  You know what I mean  The people  Who are gonna  Criticize you  No matter what you do  Are the people  That aren't doing  Anything themselves  And when you start  Getting off your ass  And actually doing shit  It scares them  Cause they're not used  To that type of behavior  It's scary to them  To see somebody  Who actually has  Personal motivation  Who's actually like  You know what  I'm gonna make the most  Of whatever it is  That I have  That's scary to them  Because  They don't do that  With their lives  They sit there  And live vicariously 
[03:42:30]  Through others  And just think  That if they can put  Some negative energy  Out there  It'll be good  Now look  I know I do my share  Of making fun of people  I'm not saying  Making fun of people  Is wrong  But I at least  Try to have some laughs  With it  I at least try to be  You know  Somewhat funny  And at the end  Of the day  E-Rock's wife  Is still inviting me  To his parties  You know what I mean  She knows that  I'm not sitting there  Wishing cancer  Upon him  You're not  Not actively 
[03:43:00]  I mean there are times  Where maybe I have  But not as like  A regular active thing  When you twitter it to me  Right  When I'm just  But those are direct messages  Those are between you and me  Two in the morning  Sam had to go to the bathroom  Yeah  He tweets  Die of cancer  Go back to sleep  I got a direct message  From Sam  I hope you die of cancer fatty  Why the fuck would he send me this  It's not even a public thing  This isn't funny  But that's the level  That some of these guys  On Facebook are doing  And Instagram  You hear him on Instagram 
[03:43:30]  Don't you Roland  I attack him  Right back  And you should  I just  I like you  I was actually reading  One of your Instagrams yesterday  When he goes  It's an honor  To be attacked by you  And you're probably  Reading that response  Going  Well I still hope he dies  I hope he dies  With honor  But I hope he dies  I just said  Why are you still alive  So E-Rock  I mean I know  You want to do it  You just got to  Start doing it  You know  Yeah I'll get to it  You won't  It's like working out  You just got to start  And  He doesn't 
[03:44:00]  Alan he doesn't know  What you're talking about  Oh  Like that's a terrible  Point of reference  I understood what he's  Talking about  Did you  Yes  I just thought you had  No personal experience  With it  So you wouldn't  I used to  I just don't anymore  You realized  Exercise just  Wasn't for you  Right  It's there  Like the same way  Donald Trump Jr.  It'll be there  It'll be there when I choose  To pick it up again  You won't pick it up again  It might  Well same way today  Donald Trump Jr.  Said that he thought  Changing diapers  Just wouldn't be 
[03:44:30]  His thing  As if that can be  Your thing or not  You thought  You think  To this day  Exercise  It's not your thing  Yeah  Well  Anyway  The announcement is  Rolls Food Court  Is coming back  Next Saturday  At what time  Do we do it  Five  Five p.m.  Eastern  For one hour  Rolls Food Court  Is back in the house  Are you excited  Yeah  A lot of guests  You were already booked  I didn't even announce  The show yet  Yeah  It's all booked up  It's all booked up 
[03:45:00]  Yeah  I just announced the show  Can I tell you something  The process since Christmas  Involving Rollins show  We'll be in the office  And he sits behind me  He'll spin his chair around  Real casually  Almost like Bond villain like  And he'll stick his right hand out  With his finger  And he's petting a cat of course  And he's looking at me  And he goes  Got a guest for my show  And I go  Okay who  And he'll tell me who  Couple days go by  He does it again  He does it again  This happened earlier this week too  And I said  How many damn guests  Are you booking for this show  And you can count them 
[03:45:30]  On two hands right now  I just picture him  Petting a cat  And then saying  Eric  I have a guest for the show  And then just picking up the cat  And taking a bite out of it  He rubs his stomach  While he shoots the other finger  Out at you  Oh  Yes exactly  Like that  He rubs his belly  And he gives you the finger  Now listen  It's a big show  It's your second time at bat  Yeah  First one I'll say  Home run  It's not about the heavy  Chef hitters  You got big  You got big plans for it 
[03:46:00]  Yeah I got the iron chefs  Coming in  Yeah  Yeah big chefs  It's very exciting  Eran  Are you going to follow it up  With Bageling with the Sex 2  I don't think this time around  Why  Just because I don't  I'm not ready to do it again yet  What do you got to do to get ready  Just call it on the radio show  You should call Scott and Todd  Are you kidding me  Big O and Dukes are listening  Oh my god  You should get Scott and Todd  Dude that would be a get  Big O and Dukes are listening  To their  This right now  Going what the fuck dude  Why  How are you not ready  We're ready 
[03:46:30]  They bought train tickets  And everything  Yeah  What do you mean  You're not ready  Dennis in Baltimore  Hey guys  E-Rock  You just  You really need to listen to Sam  That's right  Hearing you over the years  You remind me a lot of myself  I'm 38  A little older than you  Low self-esteem  Low self-confidence  I've always struggled with  Doing what I want to do  Because I feel like  I'm going to fail  But Sam's right  You've loved radio 
[03:47:00]  All your life  You need to do this  And embrace what  What's happened on O&A  And I don't mean this  To sound mean or anything  But like I said  Embrace what's happened on O&A  And your podcast  Name it something  That the fans are going to love  The one thing I thought of  Was  Like I said  Not to offend you  Piggy Boy  Podcast  I think that would be great  What about Pigcast?  No thank you  5-7-1  They call it Piggy Boy  So Piggy Boy Podcast  4-8-0  Better ring to it 
[03:47:30]  Podfat  But Dennis is right  Maybe you don't do  Exactly Piggy Boy Podcast  But Dennis is right  Don't give out his phone number  He's right  Dennis is a loser  Because I know a Dennis  Dennis is a loser  Because I know a Dennis  Ha ha ha  That's the quote  You probably are sitting there going  I must not have heard that right  That's more of the behind the scenes  Oh I don't care  It just made me laugh  The point that Dennis is making  Is  Maybe not  To that extent  But 
[03:48:00]  Take  The audience  That you've  Garnered  With this show  And own the stuff  Like if you own  What you're made fun of for  If you go on  And you talk about  How fucking awesome  Legos are  And you talk about  How great coke floats are  Doctor who  And you talk about  Never had a coke float  Oh come on Eric  If you're just gonna lie  In the conversation  I don't know why I'm giving you advice  But if you go on  And you're like  Let me tell you about  My Florida days  And all this stuff 
[03:48:30]  People will love it  And you're not gonna get everybody  And some people will not love it  But it's like  When I started doing  The stupid YouTube videos  With the camera pointed at my face  And that's all it is  I'm sitting there  And I'm looking at the camera  Before I shoot  And I'm like  I know  That I'm literally  Going to get people  Who wish for my death  If I do this  I know it's going to happen  Regardless of what I say  Into that camera lens 
[03:49:00]  There are going to be people  That wish for me to die  You gotta get past it  Okay but I think you're not seeing  The point of  I'm not worried about the audience  Shitting on this  You just said  I'm worried  No  I'm more concerned  About the actual  Environment here  That we're working on  About destroying this  Who gives a fuck  About the environment here  How could you possibly care  What anybody here thinks anymore 
[03:49:30]  It's been eight years  Are you kidding me  People might actually  Listen to it  Because then they'll hear  ONA shit on the air  And then they'll download  Your podcast  And then you'll be huge  He's right  Alan's right  Because the minute  ONA talk about it  You've got thousands of people  That are going to listen  Regardless  Now you're not going to  Hold all those people  But you know what's going to happen  You'll do this thing  Right  And  ONA  All of us  Will trash it  The first week  Guaranteed  You're right  It will come into work 
[03:50:00]  And we will do  Two  Maybe three hours  On how miserable it is  And it'll be hilarious  And we'll all love it  But then you've got to  Just come back  And do it the next week  And do it the next week  And do it the next week  And just do it  Week after week  Until  ONA are either  Tired of it  Or you get to the point  Where they're like  Oh that's kind of good  Like  Rocky speech  Well they bring you down  You get up  Right  Right Roland  And what did he do  He ended the cold war  Eric  Rocky ended the cold war 
[03:50:30]  Thanks to that speech  How you cannot be listening to this  Is beyond me  Remember when I came in here  One show on Hits 1  One show  And what happened  What happened to me Eric  Yeah that was the first hour of the show  Destroyed  Dismantled  Horribly crushed  But I've been doing Hits 1 shows  For the last three years anyway  Now I haven't dramatically improved  But  I've been doing them  Look at Jenny Hutt  No Jenny Hutt's a terrible example 
[03:51:00]  I mean she  Literally everything she does  Could be brought on  And made fun of  Yeah but she thinks she's great  So  Well yeah I mean  You could go the route  Where you're just  Totally delusional  And your red headed  Head is up in the clouds  Somewhere  Not realizing what's happening  Around you  How's it going Travis  I don't know where this  Lack of confidence  From Eric comes from  Me neither  Because like  He did  He did his show  And they  Barely talked about it  The  The week after  They barely talked about it  It was more like  Leading up to it 
[03:51:30]  He was getting shit on  But they barely talked about it  And that was just because of  His guest process  Right  You know  Like  The fans overwhelmingly enjoyed it  Like  Right and you read the responses  Yeah reading Twitter and Facebook  And everything  They overwhelmingly enjoyed it  Opie and Anthony  Basically didn't talk about it  Right  So I don't  I don't see where all  You know what I hear  I hear excuses  Right  Excuses  Eric  Eric  Travis is right  It's excuses  You watch wrestling  Yeah  What role do you think you play  Here 
[03:52:00]  Right now I'm Brad Maddox  I don't even know what that means  Because you couldn't be  You're not handsome  You're not in shape  I'm not talking about that  Brad Maddox is the guy you wish you were  When you're taking selfies on Facebook  He's Miss Elizabeth  Miss Elizabeth you think  No  Eric  You're not the heel  You're not the guy that people are going to bash  Okay  You're the underdog  Alright  You're 1-2-3 kid  Yeah you're like the hurricane  Yeah  Yeah  You're the 1-2-3 kid  And you know what 
[03:52:30]  You're about to moonsault Razor Ramon  Grab that fucking money  A man your size is about to moonsault Razor Ramon  That's quite a feat Eric  Everybody loves the underdog  He's not listening  I know  And he never understands that  That he's the underdog  And everybody loves the underdog  You know why everybody hates me  Because I'm the guy who makes fun of the underdog  I am the blonde guy from Karate Kid  I'm sweep the leg Johnny  Okay  You're Ralph Macchio  You're Rudy  Erickson  You're Erickson  I'm the bully 
[03:53:00]  Somehow  My unathletic squeaky voice  Has become the bully in this operation  And that's the role that I'll take  But you have to  As heavy as you are  I'm lifting you up  Okay  You like that one Alan  You did  Alan liked it Eric  Good for him  Good for him  You know what I'm saying to you  Listen to Mark in Iowa  If you don't believe me  Mark  Hey what's up man  How you doing  Well  You can tell  Erick  That his show  Couldn't be any worse 
[03:53:30]  Than your show is  What a fucking asshole  This Mark is  But that's what I have to deal with  And I come back here every day  Okay  I have to deal with Marks in my life  I get made fun of on the air  Okay  I have to sit by that computer every day  Once a day somebody makes fun of me  For not knowing how to use Google  It's difficult  And YouTube  YouTube is owned by Google  I thought it was  Taken care of in one statement  Then Yahoo  I tried using Yahoo 
[03:54:00]  Because it's a little easier than Google  Fortunately the search results  Are not as good  Fred in Brooklyn  Hey what's up Fanny  What's up buddy  Hey  Erick  Hey Fred  I listened to your first podcast  It was fun  Right  What you did is you relinquished  Too much of your podcast  To someone else  People are interested in you  They really are  You have a  A vast knowledge of the radio business  You can share your experiences  I don't get it  Erick 
[03:54:30]  I really don't get it  It's so therapeutic  And you build confidence in yourself  Fred you do a podcast correct?  I do  And it's just you  It sucks shit  But I continue  I continue because it's therapeutic  And it gives me something to do  And you know what  It's a hobby  Right  You only get better at it  Erick  Just give it a shot  You're on the radio every day  I'd say if you could talk through the computer  You can talk on my retweet  I'd let people know you're doing it  You get Fred's retweet  And Fred from Brooklyn is like 
[03:55:00]  A very powerful guy  Oh yeah  Powerful  Well now that I know you don't hate me  I'll call in regularly  Yeah I didn't know  Fred thought I hated him  Because for some reason  I blocked him at some point  I'm not sure why  But I saw him on the night  Of the Patrice benefit  And he goes  I go hey Fred  How's it going  And you know  We're making small talk  And I think he realized  As we were talking  Obviously I don't hate him  Because my wife and I  Were having a nice conversation with him  And he goes  Could I ask you to do something for me  And I was like yeah  And he goes  Could you unblock me  And I was like  I blocked you?  I like your tweets 
[03:55:30]  And then all of a sudden  They stopped showing up  When I said something  About your wedding  I think I said  Jump in  The water's warm  That's not even unpleasant  I've been married  For over 20 years  It's warm water  And you just  I never saw a tweet again  That was it  If I need well wishes  From you Fred  Hey  I got a winning marriage  At last  That congratulations  Is going to go right to the bank  All right  Well thank you very much Fred  You're back in my good graces  Thank you sir 
[03:56:00]  When you do your podcast  Just think of something  That interests you  And it'll interest the people  That listen to you every day  I assure you  Right  Well that's what he did the first time  And everybody liked it  Everybody liked your show Eric  It's almost like he lacks confidence  From being beaten down for eight years  And I don't understand why  That's a weird thing isn't it  It's very strange  You're right Travis  It doesn't really make sense  It doesn't add up  No it doesn't  You got it  You don't even have to worry  About trying to direct people  To a website Eric  You got a channel  And an hour  That's just like

[03:57:00]  And see if he wants it  Eric we have alternatives  Although Scorch  May not come in  Because I'm not sure  If he talks to me anymore  Scorch doesn't have to  He's syndicated  Internationally to London  That's true  His show is very big  In London, England  Garth in Indiana  Hey Sam  I really don't appreciate  You saying that  Iraq is an underdog  He eats underdogs  He's kidding  Iraq  Iraq wasn't listening  Don't even worry about it  You didn't hurt his feelings  Marshall in Texas  Hey Siri 
[03:57:30]  First of all  The Holocaust  Is quite literally  Less of an injustice  Than the fact that  You're not a  Millionaire  High powered radio host  Thank you very much  And I think that's true  I mean  It's been brought up  In history  Accurate  Absolutely true  Not only did this  Take place  But also  You know Sam Roberts  Yes  I'm a historian  I have a master's  In history  So I know these things  Nice  But then also  You know  I listened to Iraq's  First thing  And I had expectations  Going into it 
[03:58:00]  That it was going to be  You know fat  And dull  And boring  And stupid  Right  Famelly  Sure  Go on  I don't know  Irritating  And uninteresting  And slidery  Yeah  If that makes sense  Yeah go on  There'd be portals  To other time periods  Sure  I felt the same way  Yeah  And just kind of  I don't know  Just  White bread  And tarted  And  Kind of  Fat  Oh wait I already said fat 
[03:58:30]  Right  And then what happened  And obnoxious  And it actually was interesting  Like I  About radio  So it was  It was cool  Eric you have the gift  Of very low expectations  When you have low expectations  When people have very low expectations  Only good can come  That's true  Susan Boyle  Susan Boyle  Well he's right  Eric does look like Susan Boyle  People are like  There's no way  He's going to do a good radio show  Listen  E-Ruck  You'd look a lot better  If you'd shave  You know what I mean
