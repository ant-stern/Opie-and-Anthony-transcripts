<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a discussion of Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore's potential Twitter exodus due to a rumored reality show exploiting the platform.  This segued into a debate about Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor's "wise Latina woman" quote, sparking conversation about race and judicial impartiality.  The hosts then moved on to geopolitical issues, expressing frustration with the US government's response to North Korean missile launches and Iranian actions, followed by commentary on O.J. Simpson's appeal and Fred Goldman's continuing anger.  Mike Tyson's film and the death of his daughter were briefly mentioned, alongside a quick update on the swine flu.  A significant portion of the show criticized Mayor Bloomberg's Times Square pedestrianization plan.  President Obama's perceived hypocrisy regarding corporate junkets to Las Vegas and the ongoing "John & Kate Plus 8" drama, including Kate Gosselin's physical transformation, were also discussed, along with Jose Canseco's disastrous MMA debut.  A website promoting show rundowns was advertised.

The next segment started with more speculation about Kate Gosselin's new show and appearance, followed by an anecdote about their manager, Jonathan, being a terrible party conversationalist, recounted through a story involving awkward questions about a house possibly linked to Albert Speer and Hitler. The majority of this segment focused on a shocking video of a man punching a blind woman on a bus, eliciting highly offensive language from the hosts and callers who reacted with anger and disgust.  The hosts and callers speculated about the attacker's motivations and discussed the video's viral spread.  The segment also included a negative review of a country music demo from a caller named Kenny, audio from Chris Chan detailing his self-described habits of recycling and consuming his own semen, along with self-spanking and wearing adult diapers, and a discussion of his online persona.  Finally, the hosts played audio clips from Larry Sinclair, who claimed to have had a sexual encounter with Barack Obama, and further discussed Chris Chan, comparing him to Jenny Cam and Maggie Bond, with detailed, often offensive commentary on Maggie Bond's appearance.

A significant portion of the third segment centered on a Japanese anime-esque internet sensation with severely flawed teeth, described with crude and sexually explicit language.  This was interspersed with a lengthy debate about California's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage, with callers expressing diverse opinions.  The discussion included tangents on the legality of the vote, comparisons to past civil rights struggles, and accusations of hypocrisy.  A comedic segment featuring George Takei from *Star Trek* was used as a transition to more raunchy and homophobic jokes.  The segment concluded with commentary on a poorly written promotional bio for Jimmy Norton, a bizarre promotion of a fictional New Jersey tourist attraction called "Devil's Creek," and a discussion of several female teachers arrested for sexual misconduct with underage students, with offensive commentary on their appearances.

The fourth segment heavily featured sexually explicit and offensive discussions, primarily focusing on "docking," with graphic descriptions and imagery.  The conversation included discussions of a teacher's inappropriate conduct with a student, comparisons of women's attractiveness using vulgar terms, and several bizarre news stories: a teacher's resignation (with humorous mispronunciation), giant rabbits, a teen's online meltdown, a father biting out his child's eye, a woman finding God in her salami, and a fight club involving mentally disabled individuals, which provoked outrage from the hosts.  A birthday call from a listener briefly interrupted the segment.  The segment included listener-submitted images and videos, often described in graphic detail, and a brief appearance by Tony, a show "soldier," commenting on their new studio.

The final segment began with the hosts reviewing pornography websites, criticizing "whatboyswant.com" and another site.  A call from listener Gail, preparing for back surgery, followed.  The conversation included crude humor and banter, references to Gail's age and appearance, discussions of her past, her husband's death, and speculation about her lifestyle, along with attempts to get her to sing 60s music. The hosts returned to discussing pornography websites with highly explicit language, referencing listener submissions ("Jay from Huntington") before concluding the show.  No other guests besides Gail were present in studio during this final segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Choo-choo.  Choo-choo.  We start the show with breaking news.  Breaking news, Anthony.  That's right, breaking news.  We're here.  Ashton Kutcher threatens to stop twittering.  Okay, I have to leave.  It's an emergency.  I have to be with my family.  Once again, Ashton Kutcher threatens to stop twittering.  Yeah, I read this yesterday. 
[00:00:30]  Go away.  Don't make light of it.  Why?  Him and Demi are threatening to stop twittering.  Why?  Well, because there's some rumor that they finally have a movie offer.  Yeah.  And they can go back to being Hollywood douchebags.  Ashton is one of the top twitterers in the country.  Yeah, I hear.  For what?  Two million people he's got following him.  He twitters a lot.  That's because he got a hit on, what, CNN?  With Larry King or something? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, he made a bet with CNN that he could reach a million before they did.  And he did.  He was able to get on CNN to say that.  Yeah, exactly.  And then he reached the two million mark like five weeks after that or something.  Ridiculous.  So now he's like, you know, the poster boy for twitter.  But apparently there's some rumor that twitter is in a deal with some type of reality show.  Oh, great.  Where people actually stalk celebrities using twitter and I don't know how this show works. 
[00:01:30]  They don't even know.  There's no details out.  But that was kind of what was leaked out.  And he said, if this is going to happen, I am not going to be part of twitter because, you know, this puts us and other people in danger and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Why do we have to ruin everything?  Yeah, because the twitter thing is kind of cool right now.  But of course there's going to be someone out there that someone out there has got to wreck it.  I mean, remember, everyone had a MySpace page.  And what happened with MySpace?  Facebook.  They spammed the shit out of it.  Yeah.  And then it turned into, you know, someone else bought it. 
[00:02:00]  And then it turns into a friggin.  Actually, it's the best site to go and get a virus on.  And number one rated virus distribution center.  And it's a pain in the ass navigating through ads and all kinds of crap because now they're a business.  They're not just some cool underground web thing.  Once these things, it's like anything else.  You know, you talk about, we talk about this all the time with bands when they become popular. 
[00:02:30]  People go, fuck them.  They sold out.  It's the same thing with, like, internet little applications and stuff.  They're cool when a few people know about them.  Then they really get popular when a lot of people know about them.  And then once business picks up on it and sees a way to make money out of it, much like a business I think we're familiar with.  Oh, yeah, radio.  And then once they figure out a way to turn a dime on it, they fuck up what it was all about in the beginning.  So you move on and find something else.  Another kid in a garage making a program. 
[00:03:00]  And then they're left in their offices saying, what happened?  What happened?  What happened?  We were doing so well.  We were going to make millions on paper.  Does Ashton Kutcher do some good tweets?  I don't know.  Apparently, they do open up their life more than any other celebrities at Twitter.  A lot of pictures.  There's a picture of Demi Moore at the dentist getting her tooth fixed.  Without her tooth.  It's her looking over at the camera with big glasses on and a tooth missing. 
[00:03:30]  A front tooth.  You know why she wears the big glasses, right?  Which Bruce must have punched out on one of her bitchy rants.  You know why she wears the big glasses?  Cover up the eye problems when you get old.  Yeah, you cover up.  She looks like Stalker Patty now.  What happened?  Yeah, the big glasses cover up.  A world of hurt?  The age thing.  The race would wear those glasses.  Well, the age looks like an idiot with his glasses.  With his friggin' De Niro and casino glasses. 
[00:04:00]  What does she have done where she's missing her front tooth?  She's missing her front tooth.  Half of Hollywood has fake teeth.  So she had to get one replaced.  That's all that is.  That's all that is.  They don't have real teeth in Hollywood.  Yeah.  But apparently they Twitter a lot.  And they're threatening to leave.  Yeah.  Because of a reality show.  Reality.  It'll be interesting to see how Twitter ends because they're going to ruin it.  They're going to ruin it.  Yeah.  Reality. 
[00:04:30]  That's how the boy Twitters.  So that's breaking news, Ant.  Breaking news.  Yeah.  Who cares about the Supreme Court justice?  Oh, God.  That's a...  You like Obama's pick?  No.  Why not?  Because she's a racist.  What?  So I see it.  I see it.  Okay, faggot.  What's next?  I call it like I see it.  That's not the one I wanted.  I'm sorry, Ant.  I didn't mean to call you a faggot.  That's all right.  I really wanted another one there. 
[00:05:00]  I'll take it.  I'll take it for what it's worth.  Why do you think she's a racist?  Well, she made a statement about...  First of all, she was involved in some anti-discrimination case in which a bunch of white and one Hispanic firefighter were up for promotion.  They had passed the tests and everything else.  Apparently, some black applicants did not pass the test.  So they didn't promote anybody. 
[00:05:30]  Instead of promoting the white or Hispanic guy that had passed the test, they did not promote anybody because they wanted black people in there.  And the black guys didn't pass the effing test.  And...  Wait, did they use that excuse that it was a culturally biased test?  Well, you know something?  I wish I knew more about the case, and I'm glad I don't because I get so annoyed at things like this.  And she apparently thought it important enough to issue a one-sentence comment on the decision. 
[00:06:00]  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Here comes the racism.  No, no, which was just that...  Not from you.  I'm just saying her statement.  She believed that the decision was just and right, and that's about it.  No comment on why.  No, the other thing is that she believes that a Latino woman is more suited...  I read this.  ...for...  I wish I had the exact quote right in front of me, because I really want to find her. 
[00:06:30]  You've got to find it.  Because this goes with the whole thing we talk about on the show a lot, that, you know, people think only white people can be racist.  Everyone is racist.  Everyone.  She's also a member of a very militant Latino rights group.  Mm-hmm.  God damn it, where's the friggin' quote?  It's right in front of you.  All right.  I would hope...  There's a big font going on here.  I would hope that a wise Latina woman, with the richness of her experiences, would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life. 
[00:07:00]  Stop putting race in everything.  It doesn't need to be there.  White male doesn't mean to be in there.  It doesn't need to be in there.  It's in there because white males can be beat upon with impunity by any racial or cultural group out there these days.  Fair game on whitey. 
[00:07:30]  Fair game.  It's annoying to see in print.  And if she's saying that in public, God only knows what she thinks in private and how she would run the court.  And why can't a white guy have a richness of experience?  No, because it's just all biased white guy stuff.  Oh, you don't know what it's like, man, to be raised as a Latina or as black or as Asian or something else. 
[00:08:00]  No, I know what it's like to be white and invent everything.  What is the context of that quote, though?  They're also misrepresenting her because they say that she came up in the projects in where?  The Bronx?  Brooklyn?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Where?  Yeah.  The Bronx.  The Bronx.  And, yeah, they're saying, oh, well, she, you know, what a, what a, oh, she brought herself up from adversity.  Adversity?  How does adversity lead you to Princeton and Yale? 
[00:08:30]  Another one that, you know, goes to amazing schools, becomes a lawyer.  How'd she get to those amazing schools, though?  Yeah, exactly.  Was there a little program put in place?  I don't know.  Or is she one of the truly lucky ones?  Perhaps, perhaps, and then a few people that she had worked with.  And I saw this on the news yesterday.  This was amazing.  MSNBC, of course, which say one word about a Democrat and they crucify you.  She says, yeah, they were talking about, I don't know, affirmative action and all kinds of other stuff. 
[00:09:00]  And some guy, a Republican, said, oh, and some of her clerks had said she wasn't very bright.  And they were like, who said that?  You give me a name, sir.  You give me a name.  You can't just throw irresponsible statements out like that.  Oh, like you did at every turn.  People are saying George Bush.  People are saying Dick Cheney.  People are saying our sources. 
[00:09:30]  Sources.  And I'm not saying that, you know, they were right when they were talking badly about Bush or Cheney or anything.  Don't get me wrong on that one.  I'm just saying they were able to throw in just statements from anonymous people.  Well, and that one comes out and they, whoa, this is a wonderful decision on Obama's part.  So you're basically liking the choice.  Oh, yeah.  I think she should slide right through.  I think she should slide right through the process as the GOP looks at it.  And as Rush Limbaugh was freaking out like she's the Antichrist. 
[00:10:00]  You know what, bud?  F Rush.  He's loving all this.  Oh, he is.  Definitely.  Can we at least make that?  Could we at least agree on that?  Exactly.  Rush Limbaugh loves that in his mind the country's going to shit.  He loves it.  It's great for business.  It's great for the Rush Limbaugh business.  It is.  More people tune in to him because, you know, he's got the other side of it now.  What's Rush going to say about this one?  They want to hear the other side.  Yeah.  And that's exactly what they get. 
[00:10:30]  And the country's looking a lot different the last year or so.  Holy mother of God, is it ever.  Wow.  Wow.  I was kind of on board for a little change.  But now this is getting a little scary, the change.  It's called diversity.  I understand.  Enjoy it.  I understand.  Enjoy the diversity as white males, especially, are just the heads put on the chopping block  with impunity.  You can just bash them, use them in quotes that are demeaning. 
[00:11:00]  And don't sit there and go, hey, take it.  Hey, you were in charge for enough years.  Yeah.  And look what it got us to be a world power.  Now you look at the news.  Every other day, Korea is a place on ground, light fuse, get away with another rocket.  They're just ignoring us at this point, right?  Yeah.  They're ignoring everything.  Because Iran, too, which Obama goes over there and just kisses ass and shakes hands  and he's doing everything. 
[00:11:30]  And what do they do?  They challenge his weakness by launching missiles, by firing up the nuclear sites to the point  where Israel's going, ah, we're going to have to bomb something here.  Right.  You know, we're going to have to bomb something.  They're getting very nervous.  We're very nervous.  Well, the North Korea thing, they did the nuclear test underground, right?  Supposedly.  That's another thing they don't know.  First of all, I don't like reading that we're testing nuclear bombs underground.  I don't like thinking that we have confidence that it's not going to just crack the earth 
[00:12:00]  in half.  I'm supposed to be testing nuclear weapons.  Deep underground.  Yeah.  And then was it yesterday they launched a short-range missile?  A couple of them.  Yeah.  They launched a couple of them.  Yeah.  And Japan's a little nervous about that because it could reach Japan.  Of course, Seoul, South Korea, very nervous.  Very nervous because they could reach the capital.  And what the hell is Obama saying about it? 
[00:12:30]  What's he doing?  Where is Hillary Clinton, the secretary of shit?  Where is she?  I don't know.  I want to see her talk about these issues, about the fact that Iran is blatantly throwing  gauntlets out there.  They hit the open seas, international waters, with warships for the first time yesterday.  They said it was off the coast of Somalia to protect their interests, but they've never 
[00:13:00]  left like the Gulf.  They've never left their bordering waters.  You're expected too much from Hillary.  Too much.  She couldn't even keep Bill's missile in his pants.  Exactly.  That's another dick joke.  Whoa.  You know what, though?  It's almost like who cares if North Korea's firing?  I'm tired of worrying about these fucking shit.  I don't care.  You know what?  You're tired until they blow something up.  Let them.  Honest to God.  They're not going to attack us.  Let them.  Let them attack somebody. 
[00:13:30]  Fuck them.  The ripples of repercussion that would affect us.  We wouldn't be hit by the bomb itself.  And I'm not even talking about fallout blowing its way over our country because I'm sure it's  a pretty nasty, unclean bomb that they're putting together there with a lot of fallout.  Oh, it's not pure cocaine, my friend.  Not one of these good bombs like we got.  It's not pure cocaine.  It's cut up a bit.  But economically, a nuclear detonation anywhere in anger, in force, not in testing, on this 
[00:14:00]  planet will fucking crush any economic growth that we're trying to pull ourselves out of  this recession with.  And you do have to look at allies.  You do have to look at Japan.  If fucking Kim Jong-il decides, let me just fire a nuke at Japan because he's crazy. 
[00:14:30]  It's not out of the realm of possibility.  It's not probable, but it's not out of the realm of possibility.  If he did that, do you know what Japan does for this world?  I like Japan.  I really do.  But you know what?  Every time we stick our faces in and try to protect everybody else, the whole world  has, in the last 35 years, done nothing but turn against us and nothing but call us colonizers  in the world.  Absolutely.  Fuck them.  I'm tired of it.  It's like if Ahmadinejad wants to test, fuck them. 
[00:15:00]  Test all the weapons you want.  You know what it is, though?  And if they fuck with Israel, Israel will wipe Iran off the map.  That's not, I'm sick of worrying about everybody else.  You know what it is, though?  You're talking like someone that saw an iceberg on a ship, said something, it hit the ship,  and now you're sinking along with it just going, see, I told you.  Like you get the satisfaction of going, see, we were here trying to protect everybody, and  now this guy's hair is falling out in clumps, and my dollar is worth a penny, and some countries 
[00:15:30]  we know are just gone now.  It doesn't seem like we have a choice anymore, because like you said, the whole world is  now connected.  You know what?  Yeah, it is like we don't have a choice.  I do agree with Jimmy on the fact that we have been world police for too long, and it's  time to let the rest of the world try to sort out their difficulties and problems without  us jumping in as the superpower parent that has to keep the kids in line.  Let's try to deal with them.  Let's fucking try to deal with them. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Let China deal with them.  What does North Korea mean?  Yeah, in the civilized fashion that they do.  Wouldn't that be nice?  But for some reason, China won't, because they have aligned themselves with communist North  Korea.  They give them little spankings every so often, verbally, but they won't really ever do anything  to North Korea.  How about South Korea, then?  Instead of bitching and moaning about our soldiers being over there, how about fucking South Korea  does something to fucking defend themselves in the world against the North?  Well, if that happened once, it didn't quite work out. 
[00:16:30]  The line went right back to where it was.  Yep.  We got a good comedy TV series out of it, but that's about it.  It was kind of a waste of time.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, Drudge Report.  They have a pretty good picture of Hillary Clinton up.  Oh, it's great.  Yeah.  Really?  I got to see this.  She's just shrugging.  Shrugging like a...  And the headline is...  Yeah.  The headline is North Korea...  Oh, it's not a shrug.  Yeah, go to the top.  North Korea fires another missile, and Hillary's at the podium putting her hand over her eyes 
[00:17:00]  like she's shielding the light, looking, and it's almost as if she's looking for the  missile.  Like where?  They did?  Yeah, they did.  Where?  Where?  Where did that go?  Over here?  Where did it come from?  Over there?  What?  It's insanity.  And then on a kind of a connected note, I want to talk about the OJ thing quickly, too,  because this has to do with race.  OJ is actually appealing his conviction in Vegas. 
[00:17:30]  Well, of course he is.  On the grounds that the jury was not diverse enough.  There were one Hispanic, and I guess the rest were white.  Not diverse enough of a jury forum.  Isn't this supposed to be a jury of your peers, and aren't we all equal in the eyes of the  blind justice that's blindfolded?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  This guy is...  Oh, is that why it's blindfolded?  Yeah.  Because it just weighs the evidence with the scale.  It doesn't see. 
[00:18:00]  It just weighs the evidence.  Yeah, I know.  It is ridiculous.  It's dumb.  She'll have her tits hanging out, too.  Doesn't she, like, sometimes have her tits hanging out?  It's like, Jesus Christ, if that ain't distracting, I'm not looking at the scales anymore.  Look at the justice's tits.  I want to feel your tits.  That's fantastic.  You're not going to know who felt you up.  I love it.  The blind justice tits.  Right.  Yeah, but he had to come up with something.  He doesn't want to rot in jail.  Also, I was telling you before the show, if that's the best he could come up with, he  is in trouble.  Yeah, yeah.  Because everyone tries to appeal, right? 
[00:18:30]  You figured the race card worked the first time.  Let's go back to the race card.  Did anybody call me the N-word?  Like Mark Furman?  Did he have anything to do with this?  No.  Sorry, OJ.  That ain't going to work out for him.  You're going to rot in jail.  But, again, it's just another thing of, you know, how often would a white guy be able  to turn around and go, yeah, my jury, not diverse enough.  Not enough white people on it.  Well, a black man or a black woman or a Hispanic or an Asian person can't make a wise decision 
[00:19:00]  based on the evidence.  You're a racist, sir.  It's okay.  It's fucking sick of it.  It's just a desperate move by OJ and his people.  Sick of it.  It's sad that they're using that.  Well, it's just, what it is, though, is just another thing.  I've seen a lot of things, and it's just another thing.  A lot of things going on.  A lot of things.  Fred Goldman had the best quote.  He said, yeah, if OJ wants to drive his peers, love to include a wife, abuser, and a murderer. 
[00:19:30]  Of course, I go to Fred Goldman for comments.  Yes, of course.  Some real comedy comes out under that mustache.  Fred just is at home just chomping at the bit.  Oh, of course.  Oh, the press is calling again?  Well, I got a doozy.  Here's my latest doozy.  I'm writing.  Shut up.  I'm writing some OJ jokes.  He rules.  He has made OJ's life at every turn.  God bless him.  Oh, he is not letting this one go.  God bless him, because you hear these families.  They give up.  They give up.  Their daughter or whatnot is murdered by some animal. 
[00:20:00]  And they come out and go, oh, you know, forgiveness is the boo, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.  Not Fred Goldman.  Not Freddy.  No, Fred is living with anger until OJ drops dead.  OJ's going to have cancer, and he's going to be down to 80 pounds, and he'll be in that  hospital room just, you know.  Oh, yeah, poking his ribs.  Right.  Tragic news.  The Mike Tyson thing did not end well.  No, that's, you know.  A four-year-old daughter dies.  Yee.  She was pretty much dead when they found her, you know, right?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:20:30]  That's it, yeah.  I mean, she was still breathing, but it was very obvious that she wasn't going to make  it.  She might have been braided or something.  Poor Iron Mike.  Got that movie out and stuff.  The movie is terrific.  The filmmaking is horrendous.  I know.  Did anyone see the Tyson?  I saw the trailer for it.  The Tyson movie.  It gives you a good glimpse as to what it's about.  James Tolbeck, right?  Yeah.  Directed the Tyson movie.  He got Tyson to open up and just talk for an hour and 40 minutes straight.  That's the movie.  An hour and 40 minutes with a bunch of, like, clips and highlights of Tyson's life. 
[00:21:00]  Very open and honest.  But the filmmaking is like, it's like a, I don't know, like a film project that a college  kid would do.  Yeah.  And why does he have to be in it?  Who?  The director.  Is he in the actual movie?  Like, yeah, he puts himself in there at some point.  I don't remember seeing him.  Yeah.  No?  I don't know.  I saw him the trailer.  Maybe it was just, like, a thing showing him as the director.  Well, they show Tyson talking, and then they make Tyson talking small on the screen, and  then bring up another Tyson talking.  Yeah.  So, you know what I mean?  Like, if I filmed you, but now put it on screen three different times? 
[00:21:30]  It's almost like a...  It's like, why do you need to do that?  It's like somebody singing on the old Dinah Shore show.  Right, right.  It would fade out and...  So, he's doing all this weird, like...  He's trying to be artistic.  I'm in college, and this is my way of being artistic.  Yeah.  It was kind of lame.  Yeah.  But what Tyson was saying, and the movie itself, it was really good.  Yeah, yeah.  Very interesting.  Because Tyson comes across very intelligent.  More intelligent than people realize.  Yeah.  But his daughter is dead.  Yeah, that's... 
[00:22:00]  And I guess another one of Tyson's kids found the daughter in that scene.  Seven-year-old son, yeah.  Seven-year-old?  Ew.  Yeah.  They'll have to look and see if he had anything.  Like, you know, kids are...  Kids fuck around, and they're playing.  They're going to have to make sure he had nothing to do with it, too.  They said they were investigating it.  Yeah.  But it looks like an accident and whatever.  I don't think they want to, you know...  I'm sure it was an accident either way.  Yeah, yeah, but is it a playtime accident, or did she just fall into something?  I don't know.  And we have your swine flu update. 
[00:22:30]  Do we?  Two more died in New York City.  Really?  But the news is, you know, they're...  See, look, the coverage is off the TVs, by the way.  Because I think they have realized that we don't want to listen.  We don't want to hear about the swine flu.  Two more dead in New York yesterday.  Three people killed getting run over by cars yesterday in the boroughs, by the way.  How do you know?  I read in the paper.  Three people were killed just walking around, getting run over by cars.  Two people killed by swine flu. 
[00:23:00]  And the two people killed by the swine flu had other issues.  Right, right.  Once again.  Underlying...  The swine flu is really dangerous for people that have other issues.  Right.  If you're a healthy human being, the odds of you dying from the swine flu are just...  Yeah, you got asthma, some...  I'll give you asthma.  Diabetes and whatnot.  Yeah, something like that.  And you want to know something?  They said this was a pandemic, right?  Which means the whole world is in trouble in some way.  Want to guess how many people have died from the swine flu worldwide so far?  Since they brought this to our attention a month or so ago? 
[00:23:30]  86.  Yeah, you read it, right?  That was a good guess.  I was going to guess 2,400,000.  86.  It is 86?  For real, that was the number you just pulled out of your hat?  I figured it was some of the 80s.  You got to fucking play lotto today, my friend.  Oh, come on.  Wow.  You didn't read that on one of your screens?  No, no.  It's nothing.  86.  And if you looked into those cases, most of those people probably had something else going  on in their bodies.  So they lived in some awful country anyway. 
[00:24:00]  And finally, just kind of throwing the ball around to start the show today.  We got to do this justice for the rest of the country and actually the rest of the world  because we're worldwide these days.  This Times Square traffic thing is hilarious.  Yeah, it really is making some news.  Give the people the ABCs on Times Square and the traffic.  The Times Square is called the crossroads of the world.  Right.  That is what they call Times Square. 
[00:24:30]  It's where Broadway, you might have heard of Broadway in Manhattan.  I don't care where you live.  It crosses with 7th Avenue and they cross right by where the big ball drops for New Year's Eve.  That's Times Square.  Yeah.  The pictures you see of New York City whenever they're showing an establishing shot in an  old movie, a new movie, whatever it is, they show a thousand taxi cabs, buses, and all 
[00:25:00]  kinds of just traffic and trucks converging into Times Square through this crossroad of  Broadway and 7th Avenue.  And let me just add to this.  New York City is to the point as far as traffic goes.  One car stalls out.  Almost the whole island is fucked.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  It just takes one problem to just almost close down parts of the city.  At least parts of the city.  Well, our esteemed mayor, Michael Bloomberg, has decided that traffic can find some alternate route. 
[00:25:30]  Look, I was kind of for his idea.  I thought it was kind of cool.  And I'll tell you why.  Because I was thinking, wow, why not make Times Square this area where people go and it's  just pedestrians without the cabs and the buses and stuff.  I was sort of in on his plan, to be honest with you.  The more I read into it, it just makes me laugh.  It's insanity because now Broadway is closed between 42nd Street and 47th, which is Times Square. 
[00:26:00]  It's Times Square.  That's where all the lights are.  And what they've done is seem to have thrown lounge chairs out of an airplane.  These cheap, those cheap chairs that you'd always pinch your thigh in where they fold back up with that webbing,  the uncomfortable nylon webbing, and they weigh like an ounce.  And tourists now are just coming in. 
[00:26:30]  Because I've got some quotes that I've got to get sent to you.  Are just coming in and sitting down on these things with their I Love New York shirts.  As cabs and stuff are losing their minds.  As cabs and delivery guys and people just trying to drive to work are going crazy.  Someone, mark my words.  I don't condone this.  But I will say, I believe, someone is going to get so aggravated.  They're going to go off-roading.  They're going to go right through the barriers and run every single tourist over that is sleeping in those effing chairs. 
[00:27:00]  And say, why did I do it?  Mike Bloomberg.  There's a picture where the cabs look just completely frustrated.  And there's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight people on lounge chairs.  So they're closing a lane for eight people to enjoy a little fresh air in the Times Square area.  Out of the way, enjoying fresh air also consists of, that is a smoking zone.  Yeah.  Where Mike Bloomberg has been like, stop people from smoking. 
[00:27:30]  So as you're relaxing in there, people are coming out of the buildings all around Times Square.  And now they're lounging out and smoking cigars and cigarettes.  So it's just a big smoke screen, too.  Which is funny because Mike hates the cigarette.  And hates the smoker.  So now these people are walking out like, look how nice the mayor is.  He got his chair so he can smoke outside.  Sit and smoke next to people that don't smoke.  Guaranteed you'll see Mike Bloomberg say you can't smoke in this area.  Well, Andrea Peiser, she wrote a column in the paper today, 
[00:28:00]  Real New Yorkers mauled by incredibly dumb ideas, the headline.  In the annals of stupid ideas, this has got to be the worst ever.  Yesterday, as New Yorkers dragged themselves back to work,  they found cheap beach chairs thrown into the middle of Times Square,  replacing buzzing, honking, vehicular traffic with gas-producing tours,  who really ought to lay off this.  Now she goes for the joke, whatever.  Turning the crossroads of the world from the vibrant, frenetic center of the universe  into a butt-littered suburban parking lot is an idea so ferociously dumb, 
[00:28:30]  it harks off other catastrophic decisions, sorry.  Yeah, so.  Yeah, it's, it's, no one is enjoying this, except, I guess, tourists.  Yeah.  Things like that.  It's, you, people work here.  The one line I wanted to read, Mayor Bloomberg,  admit you were wrong, I dare not hold my breath.  Our mayor, who tried and failed to shove congestion pricing down our collective throats,  has thrown the mother of all hissy fits. 
[00:29:00]  They're calling this a hissy fit.  It's a hissy fit.  But how does he get passed?  He doesn't do it alone.  He didn't get his way, so he just said, oh yeah, watch what I do now.  He seems to do it alone.  You're right, you're right.  Who else passes this?  I think he's like the Fuhrer of New York.  Nobody seems to say anything, and you never hear them talking about it,  like with the pricing plan and stuff.  He, he was, uh, uh, uh, turned down for, for that.  Where are those people when he comes up with stupid ideas like this? 
[00:29:30]  And he gets mad over the pricing.  No one can afford the pricing plan.  No, a stupid pricing plan.  It costs way too much money just to come in and out of Manhattan to begin with.  Yeah.  And now you want people to pay more money, and then they shoot it down,  and you get pissed off, and according to Andrea Peiser, this is what he did.  Uh, uh, it's payback time, she's calling it.  And New Yorkers, those who actually live here must pay.  Yep.  So there you go, now you get lounge chairs.  You get lounge, cheap lounge chairs. 
[00:30:00]  Don't forget the yoga.  When's the yoga?  I can't wait.  We got to send Sam down there to interview the people that are doing free yoga  in the middle of Times Square where, uh, where vehicles used to travel.  Yeah, do some relaxing yoga as some, some young ethnic boy is, is banging away on spackle  buckets for money.  How can you, how can, how are the theaters not going to get hurt?  Uh, Caroline's, uh, comedy club is right there.  It's like, how the fuck are these businesses not going to be hurt by this asshole's traffic plan? 
[00:30:30]  Now, when there's, uh, uh, when it's snowing out, raining out, crappy weather,  and you have to now walk, uh, a couple of blocks because the cab can't go there,  what are you going to do?  I don't know.  I mean, it's, it's...  We'll have to wait and see.  The delivery guys are out of their minds.  They were quoted in, in all the papers.  Oh yeah, they're, they're out of their minds.  Not happy.  Because now they have to haul their stuff a block or something.  And they're going to get a ticket for parking where they park,  so they're going to want to block in 7th Avenue and these side streets anyway.  And there's a new idling law that they're enforcing, too, 
[00:31:00]  where you have to, you can't leave your vehicle running at the curb.  So now these guys have to shut their vehicles off, which, uh,  this one guy was saying, the, the engine runs my refrigeration unit for the back of the truck.  He goes, what am I going to do?  He goes, I got eggs back there.  Look, I'm not a fan of, uh, car pollution, but that, that's a dumb idea, too.  Yeah.  It's stupid.  These guys got to make their deliveries,  and you want them to shut their engine off every single day, every time they stop?  Yeah.  It, it really is insane. 
[00:31:30]  This guy's, he's crazy.  Didn't they just raise our taxes?  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  And this is what this fuckhead is wasting our money on?  Yeah.  Yep.  Shutting down Broadway and building little islands so we can make lefts,  so some guy delivering fucking General Chow's chicken doesn't get run over?  Exactly.  It's ridiculous.  You've got to see, because, uh, I have a five-minute ride to work every day.  That five-minute ride at five in the morning is now a ten-minute ride.  Yeah.  And I'm not complaining.  It's still only ten minutes, right?  But. 
[00:32:00]  But I'm like, wow, what a, Kenny, it's, it's taken twice the time now.  Yeah.  Just because of this.  And, and then I'm thinking, how awful is it when, when there's real traffic in Manhattan?  You got to, have you driven down Broadway yet?  No.  It used to be four lanes straight through for the most part, more or less, right?  Now, before you even get to the closure, there, it turns into one lane with a lot of left  turning lanes, a bike lane, and then like, uh, Jimmy just said, these weird islands in  the middle of the road.  For no reason.  I don't know what the islands are supposed to do. 
[00:32:30]  It's a waste of time.  I mean, he is, like she said, good word, throwing a little hit, a little bitch fit.  A little bitch fit.  So it's more than just this, uh, five, six block closures, what I'm saying.  The lead up to the closure is insane too.  Yep.  Insane.  I got to also bring up, um, since we're talking about, uh, a little bit of politics and hypocrisy  and everything else, is, uh, Obama.  Uh, I, I like to point out when Obama, uh, uh, trips over his own dick because, um, uh, no 
[00:33:00]  one else seems to.  No one criticizes this guy.  Uh, and this is, to me, a pretty biggie.  This is, well, yeah.  Rush Limbaugh does.  That's true.  Okay.  The three of us.  Anthony Cumia does.  Yes.  Now you try to tell me this isn't hypocrisy.  Uh, he, he made a big stink about, um, and, and, and caused a lot of angry people, um,  in, in Vegas.  Remember what he said?  He made a speech and he said about these corporations that are being bailed out and,  um, these corporations that are wasting money and the stock, uh, holders are, are, uh, angry 
[00:33:30]  that their stock prices are going down.  He goes, well, it's over for you guys.  He goes, no more, uh, uh, private jets, no more, uh, uh, junkets, uh, to Las Vegas and  Vegas got pissed off and said, you know something?  We actually had a bunch of cancellations, uh, amounting in millions of dollars because Obama  said, you know, no more going to Vegas, uh, as a corporate, you know, junket or trip or  something like that to, um, uh, hold a business conferences, uh, things like that, which, all 
[00:34:00]  right, it's the hard times.  Maybe you don't go to Vegas, but the people in Vegas were very angry that he said this,  uh, regardless, that isn't the point.  The point is the good president will be at a fundraiser at Caesars in Vegas.  Uh, and he said, by the way, he goes, because we will not be paying for this, uh, uh, uh,  these, these executives to do this and go to Vegas on the taxpayer's dime. 
[00:34:30]  He's going to a fundraiser in Vegas at Caesars.  Uh, how's he getting there?  Air Force One, I would believe.  No.  I believe Air Force One.  No.  And, uh, that Marine One from the airport to, uh, Caesars, uh, uh, uh, uh, limos and  stuff.  Who's paying for that?  The taxpayers are paying for the president to go to Vegas.  Vegas!  When he said, uh, this won't happen, uh, with the businessmen because, you know, there 
[00:35:00]  are no more trips to Vegas, guys.  I'm in charge now.  Meanwhile, he does the exact thing.  He should make a point and go, look, there's a fundraiser.  That's fantastic.  Uh, I'll send, uh, you know, somebody to represent me, uh, for cheaper.  Maybe somebody in Vegas.  Maybe there's somebody already in the organization, uh, that, that can go there and, uh, and, and,  and stand in for him because, you know, taxpayer money.  Do you think maybe he's going as a way of making up with Vegas because he knows he said 
[00:35:30]  something stupid?  Because he won't even acknowledge it now.  Oh, okay.  He won't acknowledge, he won't apologize.  His staff won't return phone calls on the subject.  They say things like, that's ridiculous.  That, but no one's brought up the fact that the, he's using taxpayer money, which ain't  just a coached, uh, trip on, uh, American Airlines or anything like that.  Air Force One, the pilot steps on that thing.  It's a few million dollars. 
[00:36:00]  Taxpayer money to fly to Vegas for a fundraiser, which by the way is for, uh, uh, uh, good cause,  I guess it's, um, I can't remember the guy's name, but I got one of these frigging health  causes, you know, it's good cause, but for real, I thought, yeah, no, no, no, but there  is a loophole here.  Yeah.  What's the loophole?  If you donate over $26,000, half of that money goes to the cause.  The other half goes to the Democratic Party and gives you, the donor, uh, uh, uh, an opportunity 
[00:36:30]  to meet with, um, prominent Democrats and the president to voice any grievances or favors  you might need.  So if you come up with $26,000 and hand it over to this, uh, uh, foundation, only half  goes to the foundation.  The other half is pay money to see the president and say, yeah, I gave $26,000, I could really  use this.  And then he'll, you know, get the wheels working. 
[00:37:00]  Business as usual.  Business as usual.  With this guy.  Well.  Just, just, I just pointed it out.  Thank you.  I think we're learning today that the world is just insane.  We live in a crazy world.  Yep.  Uh, I went to bed with, uh, with, with, uh, with the Cavaliers, uh, leading the magic.  I wake up to find out that they lost in overtime.  Ah, I hate these hours.  Was that hockey is, uh, hockey. 
[00:37:30]  Great game.  What's that?  That's the NBA.  Oh.  And the NBA is not happy because they really, like I said yesterday, they need the Cavaliers  and the Lakers.  Oh, right.  That's, that's, that would be the two biggies.  And now, uh, the Orlando Magic have a three to one lead over the Cavaliers.  Not looking like LeBron James is playing in the NBA finals.  Yeah.  And, and the Lakers sort of on shaky ground, not shaky ground, but you know, it's not a  guarantee they're going to make the, the playoffs.  They do too, right?  I think it, I think so, Jimmy.  Yeah.  But I, I mean, these hours suck. 
[00:38:00]  I like, I like my NBA playoff basketball and I like, I like my NHL playoff, uh, hockey.  Same time.  But I, you can't stay up for these games if you get up at 4.30.  The Penguins are in, huh?  Uh, Penguins eliminated Carolina four to one.  Yes.  And Mets win six to one over the Nationals or whatever.  That's, that's local sports.  And Jose Canseco.  We love him.  Oops.  I kind of like, like knowing that he's getting the shit beat out of him.  I don't know why. 
[00:38:30]  Yes.  Because I don't really know.  I don't, I don't know what he was getting at with that book.  Yeah.  It was, it was, you know, a way to get his name out there and turn a dime, I think, make  a few bucks.  I think there's a lot of major league baseball players that are pretty happy to, to read  the paper to see that he lost his MMA debut fight.  Lost, lost it.  Oof.  He only lasted a little over a minute.  I believe it was 14 punches that were thrown at him.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And, and the, the ref had to stop the fight. 
[00:39:00]  And the, and the guy was an average fighter.  He was a giant.  He was a seven real tall kickboxer.  Yeah.  Seven, two, seven, three Chinaman.  He looked Asian.  He was Korean.  He was Korean.  Yeah.  I do believe so.  I'm going to try to find a video.  I watched it this morning.  I just can't remember where I saw it.  And he was just out, out cold.  Jose is just trying to figure out what to do with his life.  He doesn't know.  Does he want to be a tattletale?  Does he want to go back in and play in some independent baseball league?  I bet some of them.  Does he want to be a UFC fighter? 
[00:39:30]  Wait, who got knocked out?  Jose or the other guy?  Oh, Jose.  Jose got his ass kicked.  I bet some of his, his ex-girlfriends and wives probably liked seeing that.  Hey, now you know how it felt.  Oh, here he goes.  Yeah.  This is, he comes out, little tap of the gloves on each other.  Big.  What a big guy.  This.  Wow.  God.  He is giant.  Check out the video.  He's nice kicking.  Cause Jose was in studio.  He's a monster.  He's a big dude, man.  He's a big dude.  He looks like a tiny little person. 
[00:40:00]  He's no chop meat in the ring, Ope.  Look at the size of that.  It's like, how tall is that Korean?  He's gotta, he's gotta be 5'11".  How tall is he?  I think he's over 7 feet tall.  Now, now, now, now Cansego just took a fist to the face and started running away from the  guy, realizing he's hurt and this guy could do him some damage.  Well, Jose's punching and then kind of ducking his head.  And every time he gets close to this big guy, he just gets a knee. 
[00:40:30]  Or a fist in the face.  Why the fuck would you fight this guy?  Oh, now he just took another punch in the face.  He's hurting.  This, now the, the guy knows, uh, Cansego is really hurt.  This guy's a, Jose's trying to kick.  He lays a kick into this guy and it's nothing.  Now he's just running around the ring.  Now he realizes, I, I, there's nothing I can do against this guy.  He's in big, big trouble.  He's winded.  He just bent over like, and almost put his, now he's down.  Oh, there it is.  Down.  Here comes the flurry of punches. 
[00:41:00]  And the guy's not even, the guy's just kind of hammer fisting him casually and Jose's done.  That's it.  It's amazing how fast a tough guy can not look tough.  Yeah, yeah.  True.  Yeah, because Cansego's known as like a tough guy.  Oh, he's kind of blaming, blaming his knee, I think.  Yeah, okay.  Like he'll help him up.  He'll carry him like a girl.  Now they're, now they're big, huge Korean.  He'll carry him out like an officer and a gentleman.  Big galoot.  Look at him.  Big galoot.  You too, Jose.  Ah, is that fantastic? 
[00:41:30]  Unbelievable.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break?  Here goes Jose being coddled by some hot blonde.  If that was worth it for you.  We'll do our first break.  Okie dokie.  There you go.  I want to welcome the Howard fans this morning.  Live programming for you.  I hope you're enjoying it.  It's better than a replay, right?  That's all right.  Hope you and Anthony will continue.  The top online searches for today.  Take a glance at this every day and every once in a while it's, it's worth mentioning. 
[00:42:00]  Jessica Biel.  Why Jessica Biel?  Piece of ass, but why is she the number one search right now?  Can we know?  Does she have a new movie coming out?  There's a rumor that she and I were dating.  Oh.  Susan Boyle.  Wow.  There's a big drop off.  Number two.  No, she's dead.  No, she's not.  Susan Boyle, the second most searched person today.  Boy, that's a big drop off.  That's sort of what I just said.  Oh, okay.  I was pressing the button. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  He just stole up his job.  I'll have to listen to that on the replay.  Word for word, you stole it.  Good for me.  Good for you.  The Jessica Biel thing is because she's on the June cover of Allure magazine.  Allure.  That's a big drop off.  What?  Well, from her to Susan Boyle, that actually is a drop off.  Of course.  Well, I don't know why she's the number one search.  We can go in circles like this all day.  I think we should.  NASCAR.  A lot of people searching NASCAR today.  Why NASCAR?  A lot of NASCAR fans.  Because they're mad that the Indy 500 got so much attention? 
[00:43:00]  Oh, maybe.  Yeah.  Make up for it by, you know, hey, let's go search a bunch of stuff here.  And then John and K Plus 8.  I know it's not your show, but did you even take a peek?  Well, there's so much controversy going on.  Did you take a peek?  They hate each other.  Can't even help but look.  We're saying, our John and K Plus 8 expert.  Can't even help but look, because there's so much controversy.  Can you get the running music?  Sam's attempting to run.  Oh, look at his feet.  Oh, my God.  It's the worst.  I love it. 
[00:43:30]  I hope John and K Plus 8 ends like OJ's marriage.  They're pointing straight out his feet.  And then the fifth search of the day is NBA, just NBA in general.  Sam, did you take a peek at John and K Plus 8?  Yeah, I took a look.  And what can you tell the boys?  Well, they don't seem to be pretending to be happy with each other anymore.  John is not even looking at Kate anymore.  He won't talk to her like the interviews now. 
[00:44:00]  Really?  Well, just if you know anything about the show, they would get him on this love seat.  Yeah.  And to talk to each other.  Yeah.  And she would just berate him in front of the cameras.  And one time she slapped him in the face.  Another time she bitched.  Did she really slap him?  Oh, yeah.  Because she bitched that he breathes too loud or something during her interview.  So she reached over and slapped him.  She's a real twat.  Yep.  Apparently so.  But I guess she's like, it seems like she's getting action, he's getting action, and they 
[00:44:30]  don't give a shit about each other.  And they're trying to claim that the reality show kind of broke them up.  But they're going to continue doing the reality show anyway.  With them all pissed off at each other.  Yeah.  That's good.  How about this?  10 million people checked out the first episode of the new season, John K. Plus 8.  And I think on an average night, maybe they do half that.  Maybe.  Probably less than half that.  Because people don't want to see a happily married couple sitting there with their kids  and everything.  They want to see controversy.  They want to see anger.  But he's finally fighting back. 
[00:45:00]  He's not taking no more shit.  Yeah.  Because he's signed to do five seasons.  So they have to do this full season.  Is this the fifth season?  Yeah.  And they're doing the interviews now.  Like, you know, when they go back to the interviews, a small portion of it was them  together.  But now they're doing separate interviews.  Separate.  Yeah.  Was that the birthday party episode?  Yeah.  I saw some of that.  Yeah.  And he arrived and the paparazzi were in the woods.  Yeah.  And he barely looked at Kate. 
[00:45:30]  She barely looked at him.  They're denying that there was any affairs for either of them.  They're both denying their affairs.  But it doesn't seem like they're denying that their marriage is in shambles.  In shambles.  Yeah.  She's been walking around bowlegged with a Nuggets jersey.  So we don't know who she's been fucking.  She kind of...  I hate to say this, but she's kind of hot now.  She has a pretty face, but her body is a disaster.  Well, one of the rag magazines did a before and after.  Yeah.  She's a completely different person now. 
[00:46:00]  Really?  Get her up there.  I want to take a look.  Do the before and after.  She had a chubby face.  I think it was the cover of Us Weekly.  Dark, horrendous, like mousy brown hair.  That'll happen when...  Now she's got the hairstyle that every housewife out there wants.  The pussy can't just go out on its own, Opie.  It's got to be surrounded by the meat that is called a woman.  So when they go out, they have to gussy up all that other meat. 
[00:46:30]  Look at this before and after.  You can find...  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  Look at the difference.  We got to get a website.  We got to get our website up and running.  Holy shit.  We got to get Stephen S. from Bayshore's rundown working again, because then we can pop this  up.  Is she running from the law?  That's not the same person, right?  Yeah.  You would pass her by and not even know that was the same person.  She's a bit chubby.  Maybe she's already pregnant with six kids.  Probably.  And then the other one, she's holding multiple bless bings.  Bless bings.  Let's not forget about bless bings.  Multiple bless bings. 
[00:47:00]  No, it's an eight.  A bless bing.  That's how you pronounce it.  Jimmy nailed that one.  I know.  A little callback.  A little callback.  Because she spells blessings.  B-L-E-S-8-I-N-G-S.  So it's bless bings.  Uh, bless bings.  Well, she doesn't look bad with that little hairdo.  Would you?  Did they adopt?  Nope.  Nope.  Oh, never.  That fucking thing, that thing opened like a fucking, like a burlap sack and tumbled eight 
[00:47:30]  things out of it.  I hate to say it because it's been used, but the only accurate thing, the predator's mouth  just opens up and babies fall out.  I think we got a quick, uh, clip of, of Johnny K plus eight from, uh, yeah, I brought in  the show the other night because they asked him like, where are you at now?  Like, what's your relationship?  What's the status of where you guys are right now?  Dick.  Cunt.  I wish I knew. 
[00:48:00]  I don't know.  And what the future holds, we don't know.  I can only speak for myself.  I'm here.  I'm here every minute that working doesn't require me to be away.  So I, I can't speak for anyone but myself.  I'm here for my kids.  Oh, wow.  They are just, they hate each other.  He normally would never be allowed to say something like that.  I'm just here for my kids.  Oh yeah.  She would never allow that. 
[00:48:30]  She would allow that.  She's not berating him anymore because she's, she's got to be getting some action now on the  side.  It's, um, is anyone mentioning or taking into consideration how this may be damaging eight  children that is playing out in public like this?  Everyone is, everyone is, they don't know.  They'll snap back.  You know what Kate has said?  She loves being on TV.  She said, this is my job.  She goes, this is my job.  I'm stuck.  This is my job.  But the reality is she loves the attention.  She loves being on TV. 
[00:49:00]  She's, she got caught up in that whole thing.  But all the experts are saying, try to figure out how to get the fuck out of this, uh, out  of this, uh, TV contract and do what's right for your family and maybe yourselves.  What's good for the children?  Do you think she'll probably have her own show after the, uh, after the season runs out, she'll  probably sign on to do her own show.  Called White Was Overrated.  She'll have every week a gentleman of a different ethnicity or color plowing a hole.  Her follow-up book, You Can't Go Back. 
[00:49:30]  She'll have a, it'll be multiple blessed bings, except it'll be an 11 as a tribute to her  new husband.  A circle.  John, John's writing a children's book.  Wow.  He is.  Jesus, is he?  Yeah, it's going to be called Eight Little Treadmills.  Oh, no.  Right?  A little too soon.  Just a tad. 
[00:50:00]  Uh, what was I going to say?  Oh, I'm, just one other thing about this and we'll move on because I know this isn't really  in our wheelhouse.  In our wheelhouse.  I think most of the guys listening to us don't give a shit about this couple and their  dumb kids.  But I'm suspicious and I think that this might be a, this might be some kind of a work.  Yep.  I think you might be right.  Really?  It might be a bit of a work.  They can act then?  Is that what, because they'd have to be able to act.  She loves being on TV.  She loves the attention.  I think the ratings were so-so. 
[00:50:30]  And then, uh, uh, TLC, what, they're on TLC.  TLC turns around and fucks them hard and, and, and puts a show on where, oh, you think  it's pretty crazy to watch a, watch a, a family raise eight kids.  Well, how about the, you know, you watch a show where they raise 18, I think they're  up to.  Yeah.  Ooh.  So it's the same show, but with more kids.  So why would you watch Johnny K plus eight when you could watch the other show that they're,  they're trying to raise 18 more kids, more better.  Right.  Right.  So then I'm thinking they got together and I think that Kate is a smart one and said, 
[00:51:00]  you know what?  We need a little drama and whether it's fake drama or they went out of their way to actually,  you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Do this to make the show better.  Is that them getting married or something?  Why?  That was their, uh, I, I, well, I wouldn't know because I don't watch the show.  Oh, yes, you do.  You knew it.  That was their, um, well, uh, from her on fire time.  I have no clue.  Renewing of the vows, eh?  I don't know. 
[00:51:30]  Renewing of the vows?  There's a special episode.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  They went to Hawaii.  Sam knows everything about this.  They went to Hawaii, right, Sam?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's my job.  Let's say hi to Matt on Long Island.  Matt.  Yeah.  Sam forgot to mention that now when there's only one person on the couch to take the place  to the other person, they have a huge, like, multicolored pillow.  So you obviously see, like, hey, there's one person missing here.  Yeah.  They didn't get a new chair.  Come on.  It's still a couch built for two. 
[00:52:00]  But there's just one.  And a pillow.  And a pillow.  Well, thank you, sir.  Let's go to our pal, Mongo.  What's up, Mongo?  Morning, guys.  Do you guys realize that you have rundowns being done for your show every single day by  Struth on OARundowns.com?  He does the complete thing.  He puts in links.  He puts in, embeds YouTube videos.  He does everything.  OARundowns.com.  He's been doing it for years.  There you go.  Nice plug for Struth today. 
[00:52:30]  Thank you, sir.  All right, Mongo.  So you can check that out for show rundowns.  How about that?  How about that?  So I guess that's all we need on Johnny K Plus A, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I was just saying people must know about it because I completely know nothing about this.  And it's even been, like, sort of on my radar.  Okay.  That I know there's problems.  Cody in Indiana, the new show that Kate's going to have.  Kate Plus 8 Inches. 
[00:53:00]  8 Inches Plus.  Maybe not.  Yeah, perhaps.  Would she ever show her vag?  Wow.  Did she have them natural?  That thing's just got to be.  Did she have all the kids natural?  I'm not positive, but she might have.  That's just got to be a wreck.  You would watch.  You would look at a picture of that, right?  Sure.  Rocky's eye.  Like a hole they cut in a redwood.  Fucking drive cars through.  Got it. 
[00:53:30]  I got it.  All right.  What else is going on out there in the wall?  By the way, when you said it's in my wheelhouse, my manager used that term recently, Jonathan.  Yeah, I don't really like that saying.  I don't know why I used that one.  The wheelhouse.  But it may be.  That's where all the important business is done.  You know everything in the wheelhouse.  I really don't know why I said that.  Yeah.  I'm not a fan of that one.  Well, it made me think of Jonathan, who is the worst party conversationalist in my fucking history.  We went to a party when I was in L.A. on the Saturday night. 
[00:54:00]  We did the gig Saturday afternoon.  It was a day gig.  So at night, Jonathan's friend was having some people over in the Hollywood Hills.  And I had never been.  It's right by Doheny.  I had never been there.  That's nice.  Like into a house.  And they show movies.  They were showing Blade Runner outdoors on a screen.  Yeah?  It was a really big house.  That's pretty cool.  And we're talking.  And Jonathan says to this couple, they're architects.  And we're in the kitchen.  He doesn't know them.  And he goes, I forget the guy's name. 
[00:54:30]  But he goes, what would you do if you bought a house?  And then through some mix-up, you finally realize that the architect was the Nazi, Albert Scheer?  Speer.  Albert Speer.  And they're like, I don't know.  He's like, would you keep the house?  And they're like, I don't know.  But then how about if you found out Hitler was hanging out there at one point, too?  And he just throws this question to these two total strangers.  He's the fucking worst party conversationalist ever. 
[00:55:00]  Why would you ask that?  Exactly.  The answer is a resounding yes.  Yes, you'd keep the house.  But it was inappropriate.  Is it inappropriate?  Because the guy was, the guy talks like this.  He says S's like that.  He's one of those guys who says S's.  Like that?  Yeah.  He says S's properly.  I understand.  He was in the business?  No, it wasn't him.  He was just, he says S's wrong. 
[00:55:30]  Okay.  It was really disgusting.  We were joking about how he probably, his wife would probably get annoyed at him because  he'd go, I just have to suck your pussy.  And she'd go, just call it a cunt.  Big dumb teeth.  What kind of ridiculous questions does he ask people?  Well, he had asked me that earlier in the day.  It was like, that was just his theme for the day.  And then he asked these people.  And it's like, what the fuck are you doing?  Why would you ask that? 
[00:56:00]  Why would they be building houses here?  I don't know.  Why would Hitler be here?  And then he takes me on a tour of this guy's house.  And he showed me all these, because he used to stay there, like after one relationship  broke up, he stayed with this guy and his wife.  And he showed me family photos the guy has.  He goes, yeah, whenever they would go on vacation, I would replace their family photos with Idi Amin  and see how long it took them to realize that the black dictator had been put in a den.  That's good.  Yeah, it is a good one. 
[00:56:30]  Just covering all their family pictures of their grandmother with fucking Idi Amin photos.  He's a real jokester.  Yeah, he's a fucking freak.  We got a great story.  Listen to this one.  It was an average day on Metro bus number 3684 on Route 18.  That all changed near the corner of 15th Avenue West and West Armor Street when this man got  on the bus.  He looks like a normal guy until he pays his fare.  Then, out of nowhere, he punches the victim, Jeannie, square in the face. 
[00:57:00]  You can just see the force.  Oh, my God.  Look again.  Witnesses say the man shouted, the sick must die and let punches fly at an elderly, defenseless woman.  His initial attack was just, I mean, she didn't know what hit her.  And she was, she was in, she got hit pretty good.  I got to see this.  I got to see this immediately.  Is she wearing a hat?  Because perhaps the guy was just helping her. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, she was wearing a hat.  Was she?  She really was.  Does it stay on?  Just, I mean, yeah.  But, I mean, I don't want to, this isn't about me spoiling.  Let me, let me get the second half of the story and then we'll watch the video.  There were six heroes in all that day.  Sheriff Sue Rohr awarded them all for meritorious service to the community.  He walks onto the bus and da, da, da, and he walks up to Jeannie and just punches her in the face.  And as I watched this, I said, oh, my God. 
[00:58:00]  That was my reaction.  It was so startling what this guy did.  Jeannie was still too shaken to speak with us today for this story.  But at the award ceremony, she had this to say to her heroes.  It really restores my faith in humanity that these people did, in fact, join together and protect me.  And I want to thank you all.  Oh.  For what you did.  God bless you.  See, I misread that.  I thought the guy was one of the heroes and the other five helped him. 
[00:58:30]  Oh.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you, all dear friends.  For coming to my birthday.  I love that one.  It didn't even make sense, but that one has to be introduced to the show today.  There's a clip of what he said right before he hit her.  He said, I can smell your cunt. 
[00:59:00]  He was very angry.  Yeah, you know.  He was very angry, indeed.  Not good, not good.  Is that the woman sitting there?  Which is the woman?  Where is she?  Oh, with the cane there.  With the cane?  Why is she looking out the window if she's blind?  She's in the red hat.  Oh, the red hat.  Okay.  All righty.  We'll tell you where you can find this video in a second.  And now the gentleman's getting on.  Maybe.  He doesn't look like a gentleman.  Why has he got binoculars?  I don't know.  He's obviously nuts.  Maybe he was trying to cure the blind. 
[00:59:30]  Now he...  Oh, boy.  There's a fucking...  Oh, Jesus.  What the fuck?  Oh, wow.  Does he just clock her in the face?  What?  Oh, what a shot.  How could she not see that coming?  Oh.  What an asshole.  What a complete asshole.  I say it was race-related.  He probably would have said that.  If you're nuts enough to yell the sick bus die and punch a blind lady on a full bus, he's 
[01:00:00]  just a nut.  Yeah, he's crazy.  He's a nut.  He doesn't look like he's crazy, does he?  Yeah, he's got binoculars and a whistle.  Yeah, he's wearing binoculars and a whistle and he punched a blind woman unprovoked.  I think he's nuts.  I think he's a little crazy.  I had that same outfit on over the weekend.  What do I know?  Oh.  Oh.  Where's the people rushing to her aid?  Yeah, yeah.  No kidding.  And then someone jumped up.  You can see the guy right next to her jumped up.  He looked like he was jumping away.  He got three good hammer blows.  What do you mean he got three?  God damn, that put Canseco out. 
[01:00:30]  He went...  I thought it was just the one big punch.  Yeah, he looked like he got a couple more in.  Do they show the people getting up to help her?  Yeah, what the hell?  No, but we're going back to the beginning.  If it runs all the way through, do they show the people jumping on him or no?  This looks like that looped surveillance clip from Speed.  Oh, yes.  Wait a minute.  Unbelievable.  I see her pocketbook.  Oh, now people are getting up. 
[01:01:00]  And now the guy's just fighting everybody?  Dom DeLuise is trying to help them.  The guy with a beard there.  They're kind of girly fighting.  They were slap fighting each other a little bit.  How does that guy just not get the shit beat out of him?  They should hold this guy down.  He's crazy.  They should just hold him down and kill him.  Yeah, yeah.  He should be killed.  Like that bar right there?  The guy should take his hand and smash his head into the metal bar right there.  Why are they just holding him?  Why don't they beat him up?  They're holding him right next to the blind woman. 
[01:01:30]  So if she looks up.  Yeah, yeah.  He could kick her in the head.  The thing is, it's like that's a case where, again, a guy should just be beaten to death.  He has nothing to contribute to society.  No, no.  Unbelievable.  Just harm.  Where do they find this video, Danny?  Our hat is cut.  It's been all over the place.  Yeah, I know.  This is from, I think, a local news story.  If you just put in blind woman attached on bus.  Yeah, blind woman punched.  Blind woman provokes gentleman.  Jesus. 
[01:02:00]  Her hat just set him off.  Yeah.  He saw red.  Man punches blind.  Well, I just saw red.  Man punches blind.  Okay.  All right.  That's unbelievable.  Punched her.  Unbelievable.  Do you know a white lady?  Yeah.  It's another video of a young black gentleman beating up an older white lady, and no one  seems to have any racial issues with it.  Yeah, it's just...  If this is the second piece of news footage with, like, a young white guy punching an  elderly black woman in the face, and then it was this one, don't tell me that even if  it wasn't racially motivated, people would be saying it. 
[01:02:30]  Well, let me tell you another thing.  If that was exactly reversed, white guy gets on a bus full of black people, punches old  black woman in the face, that guy would not be leaving that bus.  No.  It's one thing you've got to say.  Know how to deliver the street justice.  We've got a question.  Whitey just holds the fucking guy there for the law to show up.  Gingerly.  Yeah, to tell him he's crazy, and we ought to, you know, be sympathetic to his thing  because he's such a struggle to grow up and...  Shut up.  She kept her hat on, though. 
[01:03:00]  Rid of him.  She kept her hat on.  She did.  Not like old, can't-keep-her-hat-on lady with that shock of white hair.  Is it true they took that video off of YouTube?  Yes.  The show has to have a website to put up.  That should be on the website.  Oh, boy.  Yes, yes, yes, indeed.  There he goes.  Let's say hi to Tom in Chicago.  It looks like A-Rod getting on.  Tom?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, Ant, are you going to base your new UFC fighting character on this dude?  Uh, yeah. 
[01:03:30]  Chopmeat.  He delivers a...  No, see, but he delivers a blow.  He would have kicked her a few times.  Chopmeat's a big kicker.  Yeah, my character's name is Hiv If You Hit Me.  Hiv...  What?  Hiv If You Hit Me?  H-I-V-I-F-U, and that's the first name.  Oh, so you're going to get the Hiv if you hit me.  I guess that doesn't really distract anybody that you're fighting on the game.  No, why would it?  I get my crap shit kicked out of me every time. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  All right.  They should be hitting one.  Punch him out.  Why aren't they just beating that guy to death?  Yeah.  Why aren't they beating that fucking savage motherfucker to death?  Why aren't you stomping his brains out?  Let's go to Tom in Jersey.  Tom?  Hey, how you doing, man?  The lady's hat's name is Charlene, sir!  Sam, you're a freaking idiot.  How the hell is a blind lady going to look up and see the guy being held back?  Who said that?  Sam.  I think Sam sort of...  Oh.  He got her in the ear. 
[01:04:30]  Maybe Sam looked...  Maybe she looked up because he yelled all the sick people should die, and she's like,  uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Maybe she was hoping she was next to somebody with a fucking IV sticking out of them, and  they didn't mean her.  When you're blind on the bus and you hear that real close, you're like, I hope there's  someone worse off than me.  Oh, boy.  Like a headless person.  That is a great observation.  You're sitting there like, oh, dear God, I hope he's not talking about me.  The odds are not good.  No.  Boy, she could take a punch. 
[01:05:00]  The punch is kind of like the Edward Norton, Tyler Durden, you punch me in the ear,  punch.  Ow!  You punched me in the ear.  He hits her right in the ear.  God, that is just violent, man.  That's horrible.  She probably thought the bus crashed.  No bus yells that before it crashes.  No bus yells that and has fucking...  And all of a sudden, you have Popeye's grease on your face.  Fucking animal.  Popeye's grease.  Fucking people on the bus should have beat that motherfucker to death. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  Really.  I'm sorry.  If you punch a blind lady in the face, the public should just kill you.  It should be in the rule book.  You have nothing to contribute.  Let's go to Eric in Jersey.  Eric, what do you think?  Yeah.  If the people on the bus would have fought back, they probably would have charged them  with a frigging rage.  Oh, yeah.  I know.  Exactly.  They beat up on the poor black gentleman.  Absolutely.  That's probably right.  Your Honor, a white mob attacked this man.  This disturbed man.  Ugh.  He's now suing or something.  Just enough. 
[01:06:00]  Dom DeLuise.  That guy doesn't...  Yeah.  It's like...  The guy's like, I'll suck your cock.  I'll suck your cock.  Just relax.  I'll suck it.  I'll put it in my mouth.  I'll put it in my mouth.  That fat queen.  Yeah.  He's dead.  Yeah.  He died.  He had a few songs, though.  He's got him gingerly holding.  Yeah.  Just holding the guy.  Yeah.  Somebody right now should be sinking their teeth into his ear and ripping it off.  Yeah.  Just pounding his head against that bar.  It's right there.  You just take his head and go, bang, bang.  Fucking animal.  But no, they just stand there holding him.  Punch is an old blind lady and they just hold him. 
[01:06:30]  I mean, I probably would have done the same thing.  I'm talking shit because I'm here.  I probably would have just stood wide.  She's curled up in the fetal position in the chair.  Oh, is that her?  Holy shit.  She looks like Ray Orbison.  That fucking hat in her.  Ray Orbison?  Were you rich boss?  Roy Orbison.  The guy punched the O right out of her name.  She looks like Ray Orbison.  Oh, God.  God damn it.  You haven't been to Ray Rogers? 
[01:07:00]  Who would call me Roy?  God damn it.  Thank you.  Thank you, old dear friends.  For coming to my birthday.  Love it.  Should we take a break?  Sure, why not?  Might as well.  We'll stay early.  What?  I mean, you know, we'll stay where we don't build it all up to the end and then have to 
[01:07:30]  play a bunch of commercials.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Ray Orbison.  God, Ray Orbison.  That was a good one, too.  Oh, that's a good one.  Ray Orbison.  Fucked up.  When we get back.  I'm tired and nervous.  When we get back, we got Kenny's Country Demo gets reviewed.  Oh, we didn't get to that.  Remember the Country Demo we did?  Yeah, wait, it got reviewed?  It got reviewed by the country music programmer for SiriusXL.  So we'll see what he had to say about that.  I'm curious.  We're going to be losing Kenny to the country station.  And then we got a fine semen video. 
[01:08:00]  Semen.  Story.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I don't know what kind of semen story we can have.  Oh, I want to do Vossipedia.  Yeah, Vossipedia.  Let's do Vossipedia as we go to break here.  Because of Ray Orbison.  That's so good.  She looks like Ray Orbison.  Yes.  She had big bug glasses.  She had giant sunglasses and a fucking, like a beret.  A mushroom hat.  It was so bizarre looking. 
[01:08:30]  She's wearing a shiitake mushroom on her head.  She looks like some fucking weird artist.  Hey, man, you know.  You know, it's like, what the fuck, man?  The government.  You just want to punch her in the face.  She's talking into a microphone.  She's holding onto it with both hands.  Yeah.  Like, she's really got some shit to say.  She looks like a hipster.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like she's been doing ecstasy all night.  She's like, I'm rolling right now.  Can't believe that man punched me.  She does.  Her glasses match the hat.  Very stylish.  Pink jacket.  Yeah, she kind of is stylish. 
[01:09:00]  For a blind woman, very stylish.  She looks like Kinnison.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  Yeah.  Attention, college students.  Are you having trouble punching up that term paper?  Yeah, my professor is killing me.  Need to doctor your dissertation?  Oh, man, would I ever.  Impress your professors with a flurry of words from the new Vossipedia Online.  Awesome.  Simply type in your question, and Vossipedia spits out the appropriate terminology.  What's the capital of Georgia?  Alana.  Wow, it's so easy.  Man, I can't remember the name of the U.S. prison in Cuba. 
[01:09:30]  Juanima Bay.  Oh, that's right.  Vossipedia Online is the most useful research tool since the paperweight.  What's the name of that mountain with the president's faces?  Mountain in Rushmore.  Oh, man, I'm a fucking idiot.  Of course.  What festivity is celebrated with booze and muggings in New Orleans?  Mardi Gras.  Here comes another egg.  Stutter, stammer, and slobber your way through college with helpful hints from Vossipedia Online.  What does IQ stand for?  Intellectual quiz. 
[01:10:00]  Man, this is a lifesaver.  Thanks, Vossipedia.  Anything you want, you've got it.  Anything you need, you've got it.  Anything at all, you've got it.  Baby.  The great Ray Orbison.  You got that right. 
[01:10:30]  It's not his name.  Oh, it's not, Jimmy.  I made a mistake.  When are we going to get a video element to our radio show so everyone could enjoy this?  I'm sure I could beat the piss out of somebody, too, if they were standing still for me.  You're just doing a shimp on them.  What's the music? 
[01:11:00]  Do you have to hear the music?  For that?  Do you have to hear the music?  Oh, I thought there was music.  Stomp.  What is he doing?  We're just watching some martial arts being demonstrated.  A demo.  I've watched that video so many times. 
[01:11:30]  Have you?  Oh, my God.  So many.  I bet.  Uh-oh, what is this about?  Bob in Cleveland.  Bob.  Yes.  Welcome aboard, Bob.  First of all, what's going on with your Cavaliers, Bob?  My Cavaliers.  Not a basketball fan, huh?  No.  Good.  But the whole town is sweeping the nation?  Or the state?  Yeah.  They're in a tizzy up there.  It is kind of exciting, yeah.  You're not caught up in the whole Cavalier thing?  I'm trying to. 
[01:12:00]  I don't know.  All right.  What do you got?  I'm a good sports fan.  I like rollerblading, skiing, stuff like that.  Sounds to me like the only thing Cavalier about this guy is his attitude.  Oh, Jimmy.  Whoa.  Anyways, I wanted to see Anthony's opinion on the...  All right.  That was Jimmy.  Wow, he did an impression.  Sound like the real person.  The Tasmanian devil? 
[01:12:30]  What's up with him?  Um, it's, they're, they are on the endangered species list now because they spread a cancer  by biting.  Really?  How is that?  Come on.  Come on, come on.  I don't think you can do that.  Is that possible?  I don't know.  I've never heard of that.  Let's, uh, let's, uh, let's, uh, go to the O&A research team.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, research that.  Let's research that one.  And then we'll have an opinion, Bob, all right?  Let's blue sky it. 
[01:13:00]  Yes.  Well, let's bake that one for a while.  Let's put it up the flagpole, see who salutes.  How about we...  Ew.  Let's run that one up the flagpole, see who salutes.  Really?  Really.  Shut up.  How about we do this?  Thank you, thank you, oh, dear friends, for coming to my birthday!  Do we have any more clips that are worth playing?  Paul Rubens is a genius.  That's Pee Wee from a 30 Rock episode that no one talks about anymore. 
[01:13:30]  All right, uh, oh, this.  Oh.  When the big fish is hooked and you finally land him, reward yourself with the pleasure  of smooth smoking.  Smoke longer and finer and milder Pell-Mell.  Pell-Mell is longer, yes, but greater length is only half the story.  Oh.  Fine tobacco is its own best filter, and Pell-Mell tobaccos are the finest quality money can buy. 
[01:14:00]  And look how Pell-Mell's greater length travels the smoke further, filters the smoke naturally,  and makes it mild.  In fact, your appreciation of Pell-Mell quality has made it America's most successful and  most imitated cigarette.  It's your cigarette.  Fine tobacco blended to a flavor peak, distinctively Pell-Mell.  So reward yourself with the smoothness, mildness, and satisfaction no other cigarette can offer  you.  Buy Pell-Mell famous cigarettes, outstanding. 
[01:14:30]  And they are mild.  Pell-Mell.  Yeah.  And they are mild.  Love the old cigarette commercial.  I never understood why it wasn't Pell-Mell.  I thought it was Pell-Mell.  People called him Pell-Mell.  But back then, they called him Pell-Mell.  Pell-Mell.  And then, after a while, people just started calling him Pell-Mell.  And mild?  Stop it.  Those things were always just throat burners.  I used to have to bump a cigarette when I was living over at a friend's family's house 
[01:15:00]  when I was, like, homeless.  Yeah.  Up there, I used to wash the dishes and vacuum for, like, a couch.  You had to do chores at their house to stay there?  Yeah.  That's a great job.  Yeah.  I had to do, like, chores.  If you had that type of responsibility, you would have never got kicked out in the first  place.  Perhaps.  So now you get kicked out, you're homeless, and now you have responsibilities to hopefully  have a couch?  Because I learned, like, I guess I have to do stuff.  Wow.  All right.  But, yeah, I would go there, and I would have to actually cook dinner, wash the dishes. 
[01:15:30]  Like, clean the house, mop, vacuum.  Wouldn't you rather live in your car?  No.  No.  You'd rather do all the chores like that?  It was fucking cold out, man.  I had a, you know...  Oh, and this might have been after they repoed my car.  Oh, okay.  You were a slave.  I was a house boy for a room and board, which wasn't even really a room.  I just slept on the couch, and then I'd do all my little chores, and then I was able  to stop at three so I could watch General Hospital, and then I had to start up again 
[01:16:00]  at four and get dinner ready.  You were 30, right?  Yeah.  No, I was 20...  Oh, man.  22.  Okay.  I was 22 years old, and I didn't have anything.  Yeah, no car, no money, no job, no nothing.  How did I get out of that mess?  Let me think.  All right.  Moved.  I think I got a job as a pool dude. 
[01:16:30]  You were a pool guy?  Yeah, I was one of the vacuuming the pool and installation, too.  In the ground and above the ground liner pools.  Did he get to bang any of the housewives?  No, it wasn't one of those.  It was Long Island White Trash doing that.  Well, they need loving, too.  Yeah, they were all just messes.  And that helped me get out of a little bind that summer where I was able to pay some rent,  and that's when we moved into Peewee's Playhouse, which was the house where we never paid rent. 
[01:17:00]  Because then I started making money, and instead of paying rent, I wanted to buy fun things like slot car sets and helicopters and fun things like that.  And the landlord used to come and pound on the windows and,  I know you're in there.  Oh, shh.  Quiet, the landlord.  Shh, shh, shh, shh.  Yeah.  Shh.  Oh, smooth.  But I had to bump cigarettes off of the woman, the mother over there, and she smoked Pell-Mell.  Pell-Mell. 
[01:17:30]  And just the most awful, harsh cigarette.  Did you have to lick her pussy to get a cigarette?  Now, Opie, no.  What was that movie with that horrendous poop job?  Something about Mary.  Oh, with the, yeah.  No, no, wait.  No, what am I thinking?  Was that the one with the tan?  No, I'm thinking the other one.  Fucking, god damn it, with the brutal old broad, the bowling movie.  Right? 
[01:18:00]  Kingpin.  Was she in Kingpin?  I don't know.  That ugly mess?  That was a bowling movie.  Oh, fuck.  Someone help me out.  Language.  All right, it was Kingpin.  All right, sorry.  It was?  I knew there's something about Mary one, with the sand, the socks full of sand tits and  the tan that looked like leather.  No, Woody Harrelson's landlord.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, right, right.  Didn't he have to have sex with her or something?  Okay, that's sort of where I was heading, and I just didn't have it all figured out in  my head.  No.  So you didn't do that to bump a cigarette. 
[01:18:30]  No, I didn't.  I can't believe you did that.  I had to do chores.  What'd you get for licking her ass off?  I didn't ever.  You're being very defensive.  Do you know this person, and they're nice people?  Well, I know the family.  Okay, I'm sorry then.  Yeah.  She's now?  No, she's dead.  Yeah.  All right.  That was a while ago, you know.  So you had to bump cigarettes, though.  Yeah, yeah.  And it was those, and they weren't mild at all.  No?  No. 
[01:19:00]  Do they have filters?  They were non-filter.  Another non-filter cigarette?  Non-filter.  Wow.  They love it.  Look at the ad shows this woman just like, ah, I love this cigarette.  Someone should Photoshop a cock in her head.  She's so dead from cancer, that woman, Sean, that ad.  You think?  She's got to be.  She is enjoying it.  But look how glamorous it looks.  It does look glamorous.  She's got big manicured nails, and she's holding a cigarette, a perfect waft of smoke coming  off the tip.  They're in some kind of Twilight Zone room. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, everything looks like the Twilight Zone.  It looks like the Twilight Zone.  Everything in black and white.  Absolutely.  Let's say hi to Anthony.  Anthony.  Hi.  Not you.  Hey, it's a dog.  Hey, butter maker.  Are you the pool boy?  Are you driving over to the back?  I'm butter maker.  Hey, boiler maker.  Hey, butter crud.  That was me.  Hey, and the other thing, with the Pee Wee Herman thing, if you have dinner, look it up.  You should be able to find the whole episode, and you should play the plot when he's blowing 
[01:20:00]  out the candles and spitting on the cake.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we saw that yesterday.  Very funny.  With his tiny little hand.  Excellent.  I'm glad you guys have a good day.  Thank you, Anthony.  Let's go to Chris in West Virginia.  Chris has got the scene I was trying to reference.  Chris, go ahead.  Yes, sir.  The scene was where the old lady is standing there, and she pulls her fingers apart, and  she sticks her tongue in between her fingers and goes, Roy, my boy toy.  Oh, yeah.  Roy Munson.  Roy Munson. 
[01:20:30]  Sure it wasn't Ray Munson?  That could have been.  All right.  Thanks.  Very good.  Backstage with good old Club Stodakani.  Remember the country demo he did?  Of course.  How could we forget?  He was a club.  What was he?  Cowboy?  Kenny Cowshit.  Kenny Cowshit.  The cowboy something.  Country Kenny Cowshit.  That was it.  Country Kenny Cowshit, which might not work too well on there. 
[01:21:00]  I'm going to probably think that there was a problem.  Ew.  Oh, God.  It looks like her.  They got Woody puking in the toilet.  What is that from, that lady?  That's Kingpin.  Yeah.  Oh, that's awful.  Yeah.  Someone was on the phone earlier and is convinced we're all high today. 
[01:21:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Could be.  Could be.  So Club Stodakani did his country demo, and then we brought it to the country music program  director, and this is how it all went down.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and Club Stodakani's dreams of becoming a radio DJ continue as he  cut a country radio demo.  Howdy.  It's the highway. 
[01:22:00]  XM 16 Sirius 60 with me.  I don't want to drop this yet.  Hold on a minute.  Maybe we are high, because I just remembered another line from the movie.  Go ahead, Terry, in Toledo.  Hey, the best line from that Kingpin movie, the classic, it's, uh, they just get done  having sex, and she says, hey, what is it about good sex that really makes me up to  crap?  I love their tiger.  Oh, God damn.  She is an animal.  You have to hook it up at the gray line.  Yeah, we got to find that, too. 
[01:22:30]  Okay.  Hello, darkness.  Eh, all right.  We could just, like, watch Kingpin.  Sorry, let's go back to this thing.  And now, backstage with ONA, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and Club Stodakani's dreams of becoming a radio DJ continue as he  cut a country radio demo.  Howdy, it's the highway, XM 16, Sirius 60, with me, Country Kenny Cowshit. 
[01:23:00]  And when I'm not fucking a relative, I love listening to Rascal Flatts.  And here comes I Told You So by Carrie Underwood.  Carrie Underwood?  I'd love to sniff her Carrie underwear.  She really knows how to fuck shit up.  We found John Anthony, Vice President of Country Programming here at Sirius XM, and asked him  to give Kenny's demo a listen.  He did, and we caught his initial reaction. 
[01:23:30]  Hey, well, he's got some personality, so that's the first thing that stands out.  Mechanics need a lot of work.  Does he do anything except coming up next?  I mean, come on, really.  How easy is this for him to sit down and do?  He totally screwed that one up.  Does this guy edit it all, or does he just kind of go in and turn the mic on and do whatever  comes to mind?  He calls himself one-take Kenny.  It's obvious.  He needs to learn to be ten-take Kenny.  After finishing up, we got a full review from Mr. Anthony. 
[01:24:00]  Let's see.  You know what?  In air check sessions, I always try to find something positive.  So give me a minute.  Um, I'm still thinking.  A lot of passion, I tell you what.  The man's got a lot of passion.  Sounds like he wants to do it.  Um, I don't think he's going to fit on the country channels on Sirius XM.  Man, I don't, you know, I don't think he's going to work in country, man.  Not at all.  First disco doesn't work, and now country.  We found Kenny and broke the news. 
[01:24:30]  Kenny.  I have good news.  I played...  Do you?  I played your demo, your country demo, for the vice president of country programming for  Sirius XM.  Why not the president?  Because the vice president was here.  All right.  He didn't like it.  What?  He thinks country is not the genre for you.  No.  He's wrong.  He said you had passion, but you just didn't translate at all to a country audience. 
[01:25:00]  Tell that guy to eat cow shit.  Has Kenny given up on his dream?  Not on our watch.  Stay tuned as we wait and see which genre the lunk-headed wannabe DJ fails at next.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been...  Backstage with ONA.  Lunkhead.  I love lunkhead.  I love his what.  What?  What?  What genre next?  That's the question.  Let's see.  We did disco and country.  We could do a little hair band stuff. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, something like that.  We could do...  Hair nation, yeah.  Want to do a little, like...  I think, yeah.  Cinemagic.  Well, the spa channel.  This is from that fake movie.  The spa channel would be pretty cool.  Spa, chill.  Chills are too cool for Kenny.  How about right across the hall?  A little shade?  Shade 45?  Shade 45 or out cue?  Well, we've got to figure it out and then get Kenny to work on his next demo.  On the next biggie. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Very good.  By the way, John Anthony is one of the original XM people left.  Oh, yeah?  He made the cut, and he's a fan of the show.  So, hi to John Anthony.  Well, thank you.  And thank you.  Nice to have a comrade from the old regime.  Not many around, right?  No.  There was a push, as they say.  Yeah.  It was a merger, though, right?  They got the best of both worlds.  I'm into murders and executions.  Oh, mergers and acquisitions. 
[01:26:30]  It was a merger.  The kind of the way that Rome merged with the rest of the world.  Yeah, exactly.  The Soviets did.  What are you saying?  That they took XM.  It was a little heavy.  They put a doggy dick inside of it, and when they pulled it out, there was a bunch of  XM employees hanging on it, and they fell off.  XM got raped.  Fucking pink socks personnel.  They're like, we'll take your listeners, and you can all leave.  But what about, but we.  I thought it was, yeah.  Did you?  But we were told it was. 
[01:27:00]  Goodbye.  But we had more.  Yeah, well.  What happened?  We were winning.  Yeah, that's the weird part.  Yeah.  Let's not forget, XM was winning.  It was like the big Yankees-Red Sox choke of a few years back.  Remember that?  It's like, oh, we got this one in the bag.  Winning?  What happened?  How many XM employees are left?  For real.  Look in the room.  One, two, three, four. 
[01:27:30]  Our show.  Bob Edwards made it.  Ron and Fez made it.  Of course Bob Edwards made it.  You can hear them all over the promos on Serious.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Boy, what does that mean, Jimmy?  I love promoting him.  What are you trying to say with that?  No, it's just a smart move by them.  I love promoting that guy.  Excellent marketing department here.  And they have Oprah made it, of course.  And who else?  I mean, broad-minded.  That chick's channel made it.  Did they?  Mm-hmm.  They did, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Good for them.  There you go.  Now this.  I'm just going to keep saying now this and just start. 
[01:28:00]  And now this.  And start audio.  Captain's Log, start date April 28, 2009.  It has come to my attention that certain videos of the naughty nature have been leaked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a good idea if it's a good idea.  But, you know, you don't have to do it if you don't like it. 
[01:28:30]  But I recycle my own semen because, you know, yes, I do masturbate.  Wait a minute.  He recycles it.  Yes.  So, now, there's only, um, does he eat it?  I'm going to find out there, Anthony.  He's a little.  But he recycles other people's, too.  Look at him.  He has toys in his room.  He's a little nerdy kid with a.  Yeah. 
[01:29:00]  With a controller.  He's all nerdy.  Nah, he's just a nerd.  He's.  I'm not a nerd.  He's definitely prematurely balding.  And he's got big glasses.  Mm-hmm.  And he seems to be a little effeminate.  Xbox controller of some sort.  Can't tell.  And action figures all over the place.  Yeah.  Over his room that is obviously in his parents' house.  The man's a complete asshole. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  Let's find out more.  Great.  I'm not ashamed to admit it.  I saw a lot of guys, I'm sure, have done the same thing in their time.  No.  Anyway, uh, basically, uh, yeah, into the cup and, yeah, I recycle it.  So that that way, uh, I won't lose any, uh, unborn children.  So then I can also still, uh, have a good number of, a good semen count. 
[01:30:00]  A good semen count.  Keep maintaining that by recycling that.  Horrible breath.  Oh.  And depending on, uh, the taste of it, uh, to the, to the original owners of, uh, their respective semen, uh, it's a good idea to recycle.  But, uh, if, uh, you don't, if you don't, if you feel uncomfortable, uh, doing it or it tastes bad to you, then, uh, you don't, then you don't have to do it. 
[01:30:30]  I, I, I, I, I literally didn't close to, like, let it dry out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I, I, my, my whole mouth just started, like, just getting all fucked up.  But this guy is putting his semen in, like, plastic cups and, and then.  And then he drinks it.  Sure.  Oh, good God.  Sometimes, though, because the cum is so thick, sometimes what you got to do is take a plastic spoon and scoop the cum down inside the cup so you get it all.  It's got a metallic taste.  Oh, God, Jesus.  Keep going, because I think you're going to get me to puke.  I'm so, I don't even, I'm so close to puking.  Oh, yeah, that's really. 
[01:31:00]  He probably shoots, he's a dumb guy, he probably shoots those loads that are, like, almost like runny egg whites.  You ever fucking see a runny egg white load you shoot?  Oh, God.  And he probably fucking just tips the cup back and takes a plastic spoon and scoops the cum into his mouth, and then he has to rip the cup open and just lick the inside of it to get all of it.  What's wrong with that?  Nothing.  Nice thick load?  Nothing.  When you're cumming, you're going to put your dick in a cup and shoot into it.  I know, how much fun could that be?  And then drink it, it's still your body temperature. 
[01:31:30]  Oh, someone is suggesting that he sounds like Obama's old limo boyfriend.  Remember that guy?  What was the best life of that guy?  Could we get that audio?  Now that everyone knows who Obama is, it's worth playing again.  He's got the same voice as Obama's limo.  What does he say about how he bought pot for himself?  Oh, that guy, right?  Okay, that lunatic. 
[01:32:00]  Can we find that one clip where he talks about the drugs that he bought for him?  Yeah, yeah.  What happened to his allegations?  Is he still alive?  I know.  Where did he go?  We had him on the phone, remember?  We won't see him no more.  Randy from New York has a very good observation about the audio we just played.  Randy, you're on the Opie and Anthony program.  What's up, guys?  You know where you learned that awful habit?  Devil's Creek.  Oh, is that where they teach that?  No, nobody came in Devil's Creek.  No.  That was the mystery.  It was at the island and lost. 
[01:32:30]  No one came.  We've got to figure out why.  But the worst thing is if, imagine if he recycled other people's.  Yeah.  And he had like fucking three or, can you imagine three or four of your friends jerking  off into a cup and then you'd drink it?  That'd be very viscous.  You'd smell it as it was coming down the fucking cup towards your lips.  Oh, God damn it, Jimmy.  Ugh.  Here we go.  Like sucking down an oyster.  Hi.  My name is Larry Sinclair.  Yeah, same guy.  I'm making this video and posting it on YouTube because of an incident involving myself and 
[01:33:00]  Senator Barack Obama between November 3rd and November 8th of 1999.  I bet the Secret Service is all over this guy's shit.  The mainstream media and Obama himself has done greatly to prevent this story from becoming  public.  During those time periods in 1999, I met Obama at an upscale lounge in Chicago, Illinois.  Upscale lounge.  After having a few drinks, Obama and I left in my limo.  Did you pause that?  This is a dance drink.  He's got the whole Jesse Ventura thing going. 
[01:33:30]  An upscale lounge.  Name the lounge.  Yeah.  Like when Ventura was talking, I know a guy.  Name the guy's name.  I know a guy.  An upscale lounge.  Wouldn't that help your story if you named the lounge?  Where was it?  And then there has to be some kind of record that Obama was actually at this lounge.  In Chicago.  Because he was already a big time politician.  Yeah.  I hate when people do this.  Well, he's a nut, Hope.  I know.  Yeah, I know.  You're looking at him like he's a logical lawmaker.  The man's a psychopath. 
[01:34:00]  Good point, Jimmy.  He's being vague because he fucking, he has white spittle drying in the corner of his  mouth.  All right.  Good point.  He takes fucking, he takes Haldol and other medications.  All right.  And he forgets to take them.  And he bites children's fingers.  He's a kook.  You don't have to point out my pofah.  Your pofahs.  Yes.  Stop pointing out my pofahs.  Let's go back to the limo driver.  The drug line gets me every time.  Mr. Obama acquired powder cocaine for my use, crack cocaine for his use. 
[01:34:30]  I performed oral sex on Senator Obama, who at the time was a state representative for  the state of Illinois.  Mr. Obama knows these allegations to be true.  I'm challenging Mr. Obama to come forth, be honest, stop claiming that his drug use is  limited to his teenage years.  He did blow me.  Right.  What do you want him to do?  I come forward.  Well, yes, he did blow me in the limo.  Well, I did smoke crack cocaine. 
[01:35:00]  You know, the part of the, you know, the state of the union going down the laundry list.  Yeah, yeah, laundry list.  Okay, now I want to talk about Larry Sinclair.  Now that I'm done with the economy and world events, I want to address Larry Sinclair and  the blow job he gave me in a limousine outside of a lovely lounge in Chicago.  And the overrated blow job he gave me.  That guy is a nut.  That powder cocaine for himself and, of course, crack for the black guy. 
[01:35:30]  Crack cocaine for him.  Of course.  I want to challenge him to come forward.  Get the fuck out of this guy.  I love this guy.  Can you play?  I can't get enough of this.  Go ahead.  1999, you weren't a teenager.  1999, you were state representative for the people of the state of Illinois.  1999, I performed oral sex on you in the back of my limo, as well as in my hotel room in  Gurney, Illinois.  Oh, Gurney. 
[01:36:00]  He's got about the Gurney part.  If you challenge this, the authenticity of this allegation, I challenge you to take a polygraph  test as I will submit to as well.  These allegations are true and need to be told to the public that the public decide whether  Mr. Obama is being forthright and honest.  Thank you.  The president is now taking a polygraph test.  The results we are eagerly awaiting. 
[01:36:30]  Did he indeed get a blowjob in the limo and at a hotel room in Gurney?  This will be part of the situation room, right?  Yeah.  We got a situation.  That guy is fucked.  You got to love Larry Sinclair.  You know how the Secret Service...  He believes it, too.  The day Obama was sworn in, I bet the Secret Service just went over his house and fucking  threw him in a black van and he's gone.  He was reprogrammed.  Reprogrammed.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:37:00]  Well, anyway, the YouTube video we were playing today for the first time sounded a lot like  Larry Sinclair.  That's why we went there.  Oh, come drinker.  Back to this nerdy dude.  Nerdy dude.  Nerdy guy.  Nerdy boy.  Nerdy.  He looks familiar.  Anyway, after that, the second topic, the one where I spanked myself.  Yeah, I just...  I was doing that for fun because, you know, sometimes I do random silly, crazy things.  And, uh, sometimes adults feel pleasure from pain, even when they, uh, do it to themselves. 
[01:37:30]  But, I mean, I'm not, I mean, not, I mean, not to a point where they kill themselves, but,  I mean, uh, just like, you know, spanking is, uh, generally, uh, pop, generally a popular  type, uh, spank amongst adults.  Anyway, uh, it's a fish for some people, uh, and I just, uh, randomly feel like doing that.  So he does, uh, shots of his own sperm. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  And he likes spankings?  He drinks his own jizz and he spanks himself.  How old do you think this guy is, for real?  Maybe 20?  Yeah, he's in his early 20s.  Maybe 20 years old?  He's in his early 20s.  He's obviously got a little trouble with his sexuality.  Um, from the looks of it, it does look like he lives at home or in some, no, that's not  at home.  A toy store?  There's, yeah, there's too much shit in there from, like.  Big Kev's house?  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  There's just too much shit in that, in that room there.  Uh, so yeah, he's, he's probably a little confused.  And then the, uh, third topic, which was the, uh, the, uh, photographs of, uh, me in  adult diapers.  All righty.  Okay.  That's a whole nother.  Do you got the pictures of him in his adult diapers?  No.  I didn't see where that was coming.  I didn't see that coming.  I don't know where the original pictures of that is.  Apparently, I think where this is coming from was, like, he's posting on some message 
[01:39:00]  board going back and forth and these guys are giving him shit for whatever reason.  And, like, this was his big, like, response video.  Ah.  It's Maya Culpa.  Uh, yes, I did, uh, get, uh, free sampling of diapers from a troll, but regularly, I, uh,  do not use them, but I just felt like trying to pair on.  And it was okay.  Not, not a big deal.  It's just, uh, but, you know, I wouldn't, I would not wear them on a daily basis. 
[01:39:30]  I wear briefs.  No, that's crazy.  I wear regular briefs.  And sometimes I do, uh, I get very stressed out from, uh, people who yell at me or, uh,  misunderstand me or talk bad about me.  And, and between that and, uh, other real life stresses, uh, it just, it just builds up  and sometimes, uh, it just, I just have to, it just comes out and I sometimes have to  definitely, uh, poo my pants. 
[01:40:00]  I mean, who has it in their lifetime?  What?  I mean, pooed their childhood diapers, much less pooed their underwear at least once in  their lifetime.  I mean, we're only human.  Doesn't it be ashamed of?  And, uh, and, uh, and to those who, uh, find it, uh, amusing, uh, I respectfully disagree  with their opinions.  Respectfully.  I just want to continue to make it, uh, perfectly clear that I am, uh, healthy, growing, sane, 
[01:40:30]  and sound-minded, uh, adult individual.  No, you're not.  And I should continue to be treated and respected as an equal among the human population just  as anybody else.  Private matters are private matters.  They're not private, you idiot.  This guy is...  You're talking about everything.  ...insane.  Insane.  Yeah.  He has a good idea, though.  What?  Just recycle and cum.  Oof.  Oh, the recycle and cum part.  Yeah.  Let me, uh, I think we're gonna find out more about this guy. 
[01:41:00]  Doug in Boston.  Hey, Doug.  Yeah.  Smell that fuckin' bleach smell.  Hey, guys.  Um, if you go to Google and you Google Chris Chan, um, yeah, his name's Chris Chan.  He, he's fucked up.  Do you think he says his real name or is Chris Chan stored for Christian?  Well, his name's Christian, but he goes on websites and his name is Chris Chan.  Ah, gotcha.  As in C-H-A-N, right?  Yeah.  Okay, we got it.  So, what, he's trying to be like an internet sensation with his video blogging? 
[01:41:30]  He has, like, Asperger's syndrome and he's really crazy.  He's got Asperger's?  Yeah.  What is Asperger's?  I'm stopping.  Isn't that what good stuff?  You don't know how to interact with people.  Isn't that what Pee Wee had in that episode of 30 Rock?  Thank you, thank you, all dear friends, for coming to my birthday!  Greatest line ever delivered fucking brilliantly.  We got one more clip from the guy. 
[01:42:00]  Asperger's.  What a dumb name for a disease.  It's bad enough you got a disease.  Yeah, you don't want to be called Asperger's.  That sucks.  But, uh, also, in reality, I actually did those, uh, videos and pictures as a favor to, uh, an individual, as a favor to a, to a, to an anonymous female individual who just wanted to get her kicks off of it.  But, you know, a lot of women, they, uh, tend to get their kicks off of kinky things as such. 
[01:42:30]  An adult fish, an adult fish, nothing to be ashamed of.  I mean, everybody's got at least one, I'm sure.  I have some.  I'm not sure, uh, how exactly how I described them.  But, yes, I have some, and I'm not afraid to admit.  Thank you very much for your time, and, uh, have a pleasant day.  Peace.  There he goes.  Mr. Internet Sensation.  I love that guy.  There's, um, there's some internet sensations out there. 
[01:43:00]  Uh, some of them last, some of them don't.  What was it?  Remember that one, uh, originally?  She had a camera in her house?  Oh, God, yeah.  Um.  Something Cam, of course.  No, uh.  She was one of the first, like, cam girls.  Yeah, she had the, she had the camera on, on in her house the whole, you know.  Yeah, but it updated, like, every fucking, like, ten seconds, maybe.  You'd get another new picture.  The fuck was her name?  She was massively huge.  Yeah.  It was something, Cam. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, her name.  It was her name, and then Cam after it.  Can't remember, though.  She's got to be, like, 30 years old.  Oh, forget it.  If, I think she's older than that.  Really?  Perhaps more than that.  Because that's about ten years ago?  Easy?  Longer than that.  That was when we were up in, uh.  She started when we were up in Boston.  AF.  That's where we used to watch her.  And then we watched her when we went to N.E.W.  Yeah, a little bit, but most of the stuff we watched was from...  What the fuck was her name again?  She was the first Cam girl, basically.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, uh, the most downloaded girl on the internet or something she was called? 
[01:44:00]  Was it?  Yeah.  If it's this chick who you're talking about.  That was her reputation.  It was the most viewed girl on the internet.  The letter P.  P.  Not like Paula or...  Look down.  Someone's got it.  I know, that's what I'm trying to...  Someone's got to have it.  I can't, um...  My phones are lit with, like, stuff about this weirdo we just played, so now we can't  get the answer to the other question.  Yeah, I know.  That's what we were looking for.  Oh.  The, uh...  Yeah, we'll figure her out. 
[01:44:30]  There's this other one that, um...  God, what the hell's her name?  Oh, uh, uh, uh, Maggie Bond?  You ever see Maggie Bond?  What's Maggie Bond?  Yeah, the girl that's supposed to be Japanese, but she's not, um, yeah, Maggie Bond.  She's supposed to be this young-looking Japanese girl, but she's not.  She's apparently from Pennsylvania, and she's 22 years old, and, uh, she uses these weird 
[01:45:00]  lighting and angle tricks, uh, when she does her little broadcast, and she's like, oh,  konnichiwa, boto-baba, and she looks...  Jenny Cam, that was it.  It is Jenny Cam.  Very good, thank you.  That was the original one, Jenny Cam.  Uh, and she, um, she's really kind of heinous.  She looks really cute on the videos, and then they had her live in Japan, like she went to  Japan, she's on some talk show, and she kept hiding her mouth, and then she pulls her  hands away. 
[01:45:30]  She had worse teeth than Steve Buscemi.  Worse than Steve Buscemi.  They are going everywhere.  I think it's Maggie, Maggie Bond?  I don't know.  Hmm.  But she's another one, though, that was like, yeah, that might be it.  Yeah, that's her.  Uh, internet, most, so many fucking downloads.  So many videos.  Oh, this, yeah, I've seen her.  Yeah, that's her.  She's, she's 22.  And she's from America?  She's completely American.  She's some white trash girl that worked at a CVS in Pennsylvania. 
[01:46:00]  Um, and...  What does she do that people want to check her out?  That's all she does.  She looks like Japanimation.  Look at what she's doing, because she looks like anime.  Right.  Oh, it's like anime.  Real live anime.  They like her.  But her teeth are so fucked up that she doesn't show them.  She keeps her mouth shut like this.  And then she looks into the camera real close with a smile.  And that's it.  But then, if you see her live, like, there's pictures of her.  Go to Google Images of her.  And pop up an image of her. 
[01:46:30]  And you'll laugh your ass off at one of these shots.  She's just like, ah!  And he's fucked up.  How old is she?  Yeah, yeah, down, down.  I think it's the four picture.  Or one of those real.  Yeah, real.  So, uh, she's 22.  And what, she works at a CVS?  She did.  Now she's like, I guess, doing shit like this.  She got, like, some modeling gig in Japan where she did some.  That's her right there.  Look at the choppers.  Wow, yeah, she's got horrible teeth.  Look at the choppers.  That's the same girl?  For real?  That's the same fucking girl. 
[01:47:00]  No.  No shit, dude.  That's her.  What shit?  Can we zoom in on them choppers, Danny?  Holy shit.  That's, um, yeah, that's her.  But she looks like, you know, a little Japanimation girl.  And that's what kind of why people are like, oh, she's hot and everything.  And then she did this live interview in Japan.  And that's what she really looks like.  Wow, she's got horrendous teeth.  Look at that fucking grill.  Holy shit.  What's her name?  Fucking.  It's really bad.  Yeah, I kind of covered it with Buscemi. 
[01:47:30]  She sure did.  I was going for a boss.  And then you look at, like, those pictures, and she's all, like, cute and innocent looking.  And then there she's just some Pennsylvania fucking farmer.  A farmer.  There's also a bikini picture of her, though, that isn't that bad.  How old is she?  Did you say?  22.  Okay.  She looks like she's, you know.  Out of college, more or less?  No, she never went to college.  Oh, of course not.  She dropped out.  Well, you did say CBS.  She's got some big problems with her.  Wasn't at the University of CBS, so.  Because she's got some tits on her, too. 
[01:48:00]  Danny, that red bikini shot, I think, it was a.  Yeah, red bikini's good.  But that's good, too.  The little white thing she has on there.  No, that's not her.  That's just some other.  Oh.  See, the other one is.  Yeah, get that one.  Pop that up.  Maggie Vaughn?  Yeah, look.  See?  She's got, like, nice tits and everything.  But she will hide those choppers, man.  I still don't know why she's famous.  She does not want those popping out.  She's famous because.  Just because she looks like an anime. 
[01:48:30]  Her eyes.  Yeah.  That's it.  But she doesn't do anything, really.  No.  Okay.  She just goes on, and sometimes she talks.  Sometimes she just stares at the camera.  There's thousands of clips of her just looking at the camera and going.  And then she goes, peace sign.  She goes, bye-bye.  And then, boom, she's gone.  Can she have those dirty, rotten shoppers fixed?  Oh, my God.  She's just some piece of Pennsylvania white trash.  She would have her teeth fixed and had braces put on.  And then she could talk, and they would love it.  Yeah.  Yeah, because she was hiding over.  She's at this interview on Japanese television, and she's hiding her mouth the whole time. 
[01:49:00]  She had both hands over her mouth, and she's trying to talk.  She's speaking in English.  But she's a huge internet sensation, that one.  And sometimes you just don't understand why.  I don't get it.  It's just one of those things.  That's it.  Unexplainable.  Yeah.  We didn't do our Prop 8 shit yet, right?  Yo, Prop 8, yo.  What happened with the Prop 8?  Prop 8, apparently, California not quite as, you know, not quite as, like, liberal and Hollywood and everything as people thought. 
[01:49:30]  There were two questions here about whether Prop 8 was unconstitutional.  One was whether it violated the California separation of powers between the courts and the legislative branch.  The other, whether this came onto the ballot in the wrong way.  And the court has brushed aside both of those challenges.  So that means that the proposition that was voted on by voters last November in California to ban gay marriage remains intact. 
[01:50:00]  Gay marriage remains illegal in California.  Now, as to the second question about whether marriages that were performed before that vote,  and after the state Supreme Court ruled earlier last year to allow gay marriage,  those 18,000 marriages that were performed in the interim will remain valid.  So there will be this little bubble of gay marriages that will remain valid under state law.  There just can't be any going forward beyond that,  unless, of course, voters were to go back to the polls again and undo Prop 8. 
[01:50:30]  But, so, for now, gay marriage remains banned in California,  but the marriages performed last year will stay valid.  How the fuck are we going to solve this?  This is one of those issues that need some kind of solution.  This isn't going away anytime soon.  What was the reasoning?  Like, they said the court said that, but they never get the reason the court said that it's illegal.  They just brushed aside the argument that it was unconstitutional.  Like, Prop 8, the court said it was legal, and the challenge is, 
[01:51:00]  it's like they're saying, no, no, no, it was a legal thing, the Prop 8, the vote was a legal thing.  I don't even think that they're dealing with gay marriage as much as they are the legality of the vote.  I think.  Really?  I think so, yeah.  That's interesting, because, hmm.  It's legal in five states, and this is what's funny, it's legal in Iowa,  and the funny part is these fucking, these, like, big city liberals think that their states are so progressive,  and yet, the way they shit all over the Midwest, and one of the places it's legal, I believe, is Iowa. 
[01:51:30]  Iowa?  Where they would think that they're just a bunch of dummies who eat corn,  and they are more progressive than California.  Let them fucking get married, who gives a shit?  I agree.  Why should anyone give a shit if a couple of homos want to get married?  I'm being honest.  It's like, why the fuck would you care?  What is it going to do?  It ruins the sanctity of marriage?  50% of them fail.  Nope.  The other 50, well, whatever it is, more than 50, right?  It's 85.  It's way higher than 50 now. 
[01:52:00]  It used to be 50.  I think we're pushing over 60 now.  But for the people that are even in marriages, some of them are, there's just criminal activity going on during the marriage,  of beatings and abuse and all kinds of shit.  What, just because it's a guy and a woman, it means it's a perfect union?  No.  Maybe the homos know how to do it better.  Well, the issue needs a solution, because it's not going away.  This isn't one where people go, all right, well, back to our jobs, back to this. 
[01:52:30]  They need some kind of solution.  They'll eventually get it.  It's the same bullshit argument that we use for civil rights, for blacks.  And it's like a lot of times black people don't like when you lump in the gay struggle with the racial struggle,  because they, well, it's a choice to be gay.  But let's just say science comes down and says it's not a choice.  You're just born gay.  That's it.  There's no room for debate.  Then what's the argument?  You see some of these little kids running around, they're all choosing to be gay?  Are you kidding me?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  They choose to towel. 
[01:53:00]  Towel.  All you have to do is walk around, and you see kids that are already gay, and they don't  even know what sex is about yet.  You just look at them, and you go, holy cow, that kid is gay.  How do you, like, at two or three years old, they start, like, fucking playing with their  mommy's shoes and shit like that, and doing stuff where it's like, uh-oh.  Ballerina moves in the outfield.  Maybe that's why my father was mad that I had the stringless puppet that I brought to the store.  Exactly.  It's a doll, bro. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, Joey, it's a puppet.  It doesn't have strings.  What is it, doll?  And that Mexican picked up on it and tried to fuck you to shrub in California.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that beaner wanted me bad.  He knew it.  He smelled it on you.  Boy, did he want to fuck my little asshole.  Jesus.  He wanted to grab your afro and give you a fucking, he wanted to put your face in juniper  berries and rape you.  Didn't he know if I was going to go that way, I'd have done Richard.  I know.  He's much cuter than that old Mexican gentleman. 
[01:54:00]  Unbelievable.  Well, we hit the streets in New York.  Oh.  They're not happy.  What do we want?  Marriage is wild.  Ask sex.  Now.  Their voices loud, their message powerful, hundreds marched along the streets of Manhattan today  to demand the right for gays and lesbians to marry.  They are standing up, they say, to today's decision by the California Supreme Court to  uphold Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage.  This Prop 8 speaks to all of us about, I mean, injustice.  And I think that's the big problem with what we're saying today is this is like Jesse D. 
[01:54:30]  Ferguson.  This is racism.  You know, it's the same.  It's the same thing.  It's separate but equal.  And we're standing up.  You know, it's very interesting how the media doesn't mock these protests the way they  were mocking people protesting the higher taxes.  Oh, right, right.  It is interesting how the media handles, if you want to look at it logically, we all  hate higher taxes.  And they mocked people fucking protesting for that.  It was racist.  It was lunatics. 
[01:55:00]  Bunch of goober rednecks.  Random rednecks out there protesting against Obama's policies.  Wow, they've got to be racist.  Yeah, but go ahead.  Try to criticize this and see what happens to you.  And even though I agree with gay marriage, it is something that basically the whole world  cross-culturally has rejected.  And I don't agree with that, but they have.  And yet the media, for this small group fighting for this right that the whole world and our  country has said, we don't want you to have, they handle it gingerly and with respect. 
[01:55:30]  I'm just pointing out what scumbags the media are.  Yeah.  We've got some great phone calls coming in.  Let's go to Sean in California.  Sean.  Hey, guys.  Basically, it breaks down to marriage is defined as religion.  You know what I mean?  It's in the text of religion.  So that's what the whole battle is.  It's not over, I mean, if you want, it's benefits that the gays are going for.  So then why are the, why are the, why are politics involved if it's religion?  Because it will, it goes back with you, and I was hoping you would support this one. 
[01:56:00]  It goes back to politics and religion.  They don't mix.  Look, look, I know.  I'm not saying, look, also, I'm not saying I'm out there in the streets marching for gay  marriage.  I could care less if gays get married or not.  It doesn't fucking matter to me.  The thing is, I don't care if they do get married or they don't.  It doesn't even bother me.  So, like, to waste fucking time with the courts trying to decide this shit.  This is my view, too.  The problem is religion defines marriage as, you know, a man and woman. 
[01:56:30]  You know what I mean?  So I'm on the same book.  If religion is defining it that way, then the courts should have no say.  But the courts, it's a completely legally binding commitment.  Yeah, it is.  It is.  And that's the problem with the whole gay side of it.  You know what I mean?  It needs to be redefined as such.  But it's the same thing.  Dude, it's the same fucking thing for a guy and a woman.  When they get married, it's a religious thing. 
[01:57:00]  It's a, you know, marriage between two people, the whole fucking bond, blah, blah, blah.  Unless it's a civil union by a justice of the peace, which, for some reason, they're able to do civil unions or something, but they want the right to be married.  Right, right.  Now, marriage, like you said, is a religious thing.  But here it is.  Even with a man and a woman, it turns into a business contract that is dictated by law and the courts.  Right.  Now, I've said, I mean, that's what it's all about. 
[01:57:30]  You know what I mean?  Because, like I said, marriage is defined on the religion side.  I can't really, you know what I mean?  I mean, I grew up as such, like you, and I can't define it, how they say, you know, marriage between man and woman.  But in the courts, they say, you know, civil union, bam, you can't do it.  You know what I mean?  So it's like a catch-22 almost, but you have such hostile both sides.  You can't really define, I don't know, it's hard to decide because I'm on your side.  It bothers me, though. 
[01:58:00]  It's like, I'll tell you why it annoys me, because one segment of the population is telling another segment of the population that they can't do something that's not going to affect the oppressing side of the population.  It's just people who don't like something.  And it's like I'm fucking sick and tired of everyone in our country being selective as to where they want more government and less government and more infringement and less.  The conservatives are the ones who are like, less government, less government, deregulate, deregulate, unless it comes to your drug use or your sexual choice. 
[01:58:30]  Then we want to regulate and completely dictate what you do.  It's fucking sickening.  Right, right.  Civil unions, blah, blah, blah.  It's boring over on this side, too.  I just want to give you that.  You know, I'm on your side, grew up Catholic and all that, but I can see it as such.  Yeah, give them, so one of them is sick, dude.  Give them the benefits of fucking the doubt.  You know what I mean?  It just doesn't make sense.  And that's what the whole jump up and down about it is.  You know what I mean? 
[01:59:00]  All right, buddy.  Very good.  Punching out.  Thank you, Sean.  Take care.  Good phone call.  That's Sean's a lunatic.  More of the protests here.  Gay, straight, black, white, marriage is a civil right.  The protests here began in Sheridan Square Park, where in 1969 the Stonewall Riots gave birth to the modern gay rights movement.  Then they marched through the streets to Union Square, gaining protesters and momentum.  We're just as good as everyone else, and we deserve the marriage and the equality and all the rights to go with it with everyone else. 
[01:59:30]  And words are important.  So you can't say it's equal, but you can't call it marriage.  It has to be marriage.  The hope that the decision in California will be repealed.  And that's why this shouldn't be a decision for the courts.  It should be a decision where legislators stand up and say what they think.  Where they stand up and get counted.  She sounds like she'd be a monster in bed.  Oh, my God.  Is she just lapping clit? 
[02:00:00]  Oh, wow.  Oh.  Does she love the muff?  Well, the majority voted on the Prop 8 thing, though, too.  The majority is against it, man.  They really are.  The majority of people are against it.  So what to do?  What to do?  The majority is not always right.  It's like that's the thing with our country is the minority has to be protected.  The minority voice has to be protected.  And everything, like, look, I love America, but it's like, let's be honest about the fucking phoniness here.  Every group that has gotten what they've gotten have only gotten it through forced legislation and through kicking and screaming. 
[02:00:30]  Like, the country has never or very rarely has just went, yeah, that's the right thing to do.  You should be treated equally.  Right.  Never.  It's always through riots and protests.  And then eventually the courts make it so.  They give him.  Yeah.  We're never going to get to all these phones.  But Jeff in West Virginia in Prop 8, the differences between races and men and women.  Marriage is a legal issue.  That's Harry in North Carolina.  Mongo, Canada and England allow gay marriage and gays in the military.  Yeah, England is a whole gay country.  Everyone knows that. 
[02:01:00]  Lee in New Hampshire.  Two guys get married.  Do they quit getting head like regular married guys?  That's funny.  They just knuckle bump before they go to bed or shake hands.  My God, no head and no ass sex.  What do they do?  They just bump penis heads and yell at each other.  No matter what the subject, if you throw your point in someone's face enough, no one wants  to make it acceptable.  Is that guy on the phone?  Yeah.  Let's go to Mike in West Virginia.  Mikey.  Yo.  Hey, buddy.  Yes, Mike.  I think no matter what the issue is, whether it's something you agree with, disagree, it 
[02:01:30]  doesn't matter.  If you shove something in everybody's face so much to where you're going to have a group  of people whining and pissing and moaning for it and you make it acceptable, it's not  going to make everybody happy.  Well, that's true.  You know, like all of a sudden, if I decide that it's okay, that I can go to work whenever  I want, if I don't feel like working, I shouldn't get in trouble if I just don't go, whatever,  and I'll raise a stink about it and whine and piss and moan and enough people back me 
[02:02:00]  up, you know, does that still make it right?  Well, so you like, hold on, so you think that it's appropriate that the government or  that some people put their view of what's appropriate sexually and for people to get  married on other people in our country?  No, if the majority voted, okay, then let it be, but no, that's not good enough.  Let me ask you something, hold on, one point at a time.  It's not going to make them happy, so no, we're going to keep whining and keep moaning.  So that's what's whining and moaning, okay, hold on, hold on, hold on, like, so at one 
[02:02:30]  point in our country, slavery or racial degradation, whatever you want to call it, was the majority  mentality.  So if the majority voted that slavery should not have gone away, would the majority have  been right?  Would blacks just bitching and moaning because they wanted to be free and have the same rights?  I would say at the time, the majority would have been right.  You're not going to make, you're always going to have one group for something, one group  again.  Right.  You're not going to make everybody happy across the board, but yet, where does it stop, 
[02:03:00]  though?  Well, when people have the same rights, and you're right, maybe at one point the majority  would have been right, but history, as we look back, it's an embarrassing blight on our  history.  It's not a proud moment for Americans the way they treated certain people.  So just because the majority would have agreed with it back then, history looks back and  realizes it was hypocritical and disgusting.  So it's like, this is just another case, and you can't, I understand about bitching and  moaning when you're not getting your way, but the majority is telling a group of people  that they cannot live the same way as the majority. 
[02:03:30]  So people have the right to tell the majority to go fuck itself.  Yeah, but that's true.  It should stand up, but that's why we have, you know, that's why we have what's called  a voting process.  Hey, there's a lot of stuff that's in vote now that I don't agree with, but I have to  live with it.  So how about if they found, like, whatever religion or, say, church you go to, how about  if the majority found that to be offensive, or found the terminology of God to be offensive  and said that you really shouldn't be able to go to the place of worship that you want 
[02:04:00]  to go to?  Well, I mean, either I'm going to do it or I'm not going to do it, if people are going  to like it or not.  But, okay, if people, what's to say that, you know, two people can't be together, whatever,  why does a piece of paper have to make it okay?  Well, why does, if that's the mentality, then why not just make it okay?  Like, it's almost like, because there are certain rights afforded to a married couple,  and, you know, there is a certain thing where the guy just said in that clip, you want to 
[02:04:30]  be called what everybody else is calling it.  It shouldn't be a, well, you can't call it that, but we'll give you the same, there's  no reason for it.  The majority's morality when it comes to this issue should not take fucking priority.  I mean, like I said, there's going to be people that agree, disagree, you're not going  to be able to make the whole country happy on one issue, there's no way, and it doesn't  matter what it is, but I just don't understand, you get to a point to where, okay, we, you  know, we protested, we spoke, whatever, everybody hears us, it's still not going through, let 
[02:05:00]  it be.  They're not going to let it be, because they're not getting, their lives are being affected.  There's no letting it be.  They're not getting what they want, so they're pissing and moaning, just like it backs up to  where, okay, if I don't get what I want, I should keep pissing and moaning.  But let me ask you a question.  Everybody should just say, okay, then you're right.  Mike, you're, you're right, what you stood up for, and you're, you know, you're pissing  and moaning about and whining.  But Mike, what, Mike, hold on, hold on, that's a weird, that's a weird example to give, because  what, what, what example can you give that's a relative comparison, like, what in your life 
[02:05:30]  are you being denied that other people are allowed to do, that you can't do as a citizen?  Nothing, that's what I'm saying.  You could bring up anything, you could bring up anything, something that you agree with personally  as Norton, that you find that a lot of people disagree with.  Yes, but we're talking about people being denied something.  Like, I'm not talking about agreeing or liking or disagreeing or disliking.  I'm saying, like, these are not people who are just complaining about something they don't  like, they're complaining because they're being denied the right to do something that 
[02:06:00]  other citizens can do.  So I'm saying, what comparison do you have in your life?  Like, what are you being denied the right to do that other citizens can do?  Nothing, I'm not, nothing really.  I'm not pissing and moaning about nothing.  I go through life like everybody else does.  Well, you have nothing to piss and moan about because you're not being denied anything.  Like, I'm saying, like, if you were being denied something, it wouldn't be pissing and moaning.  No, there's nothing that's really out of the norm that I'm unhappy with now that I'm trying  to make happen.  That's just it.  All right.  All right. 
[02:06:30]  Thank you, Mike.  Some cases of affirmative action where certain white people had denied promotions or things  like that, even though they tested better or whatever, based on racial quotas.  Yeah.  That, and that usually results in somebody getting very angry and going to court.  But, like, even on that scale, you see how enraging it is.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Even though you know the motive behind it, it's still enraging to watch.  Like, you motherfucker.  It's like, you know, can you imagine being on the other side of it and being told what 
[02:07:00]  to do?  It's fucking annoying.  Let's go to Frank in Brooklyn.  Frank.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Frank.  Hey, Jimmy, let me ask you a question.  How is it that you can compare racism and what happened to black people that came into this  country with slavery and everything else to two guys that want to get married or two  girls that want to get married?  Because it's not, you can't compare every instance, but what you can compare is a certain  view of a minority group in the country and that minority group being denied equal treatment  under the law.  I think, hold on, explain to you how I can say that. 
[02:07:30]  Like, of course, slavery is different than the way gays are treated.  But there's also been, look, let's, the reality is gays have been attacked and mistreated  and they're being denied certain rights.  Blacks were denied certain rights.  History proves, like, there are plenty of people that thought, hey, separate diners are  fine.  Separate water fountains are fine.  And we look back on that and we go, that's disgusting.  And now, well, this is the way history is going to look at this.  But the history of the way black people, which I'm not, I'm not all shopping, okay?  But the history of the way black people have been treated in this country is reprehensible. 
[02:08:00]  Yes.  And a couple of gay guys getting beat up, although it's not right, I'm not condoning  that, you've got pants and compilations.  Well, don't forget, though, the thing is...  You've been able to 300 years, 400 years, and get people right like they've had.  Yeah, but, dude, gay people are, it's a different, it's a different thing in the sense that you  can't just look at people and know they're gay.  Race is a very obvious thing.  You can't just have gay and straight water fountains, you know, especially because of the way  the shootout, one would, you know, add joke there.  But you know what I mean? 
[02:08:30]  You can't separate because gay and straight like that, because it's much harder to tell  who's who.  With black and white, the separation was obviously much easier.  Well, I don't agree with that analogy whatsoever.  I think it's, I mean, look, I love you guys.  I really do.  I think it's reprehensible, though, that you use that kind of analogy.  I understand.  Why is that reprehensible?  You don't understand.  You're kind of getting caught up in the details of his analogy.  It wasn't the details.  He was looking at it like a minority group being told what they could do by the majority. 
[02:09:00]  And regardless of what it is, slavery or homophobia, whatever, his example did make sense because  he wasn't talking about the specifics of race over sex.  He was talking about just the basic minority-majority battle.  Well, how about women?  How about women?  Frank, how about women?  How about women?  Women had to fight.  Women had to fight for their rights to get paid the same amount. 
[02:09:30]  They had to fight for their rights to vote.  What was the excuse for not giving them the same rights afforded other citizens?  I don't know.  I don't know.  But you know, I'm just offering the women.  I'm just offering the fact that I think that what black people went through in this  country, you know, with the beatings and everything else they had to endure to get  where they are today, 400 years later, that a couple of gay guys from the 70s want to  make a, you know, a whole big state of our marriage.  Marriage is between a man and a woman.  You can't compare the two.  So why don't you just admit that maybe you don't like the comparison because you don't 
[02:10:00]  agree with me on the issue?  That's why I'm calling you.  Okay, but it doesn't matter.  Like, you can still understand and agree with the comparison and still disagree on the issue.  Right.  I don't disagree with the issue, but I don't disagree with the comparison because I don't  think it's a level playing field.  And then, well, based on what you're saying, then the gays can look forward to many years  of being coddled and treated with kid gloves and walking on eggshells when we talk about  them.  So maybe in the future, they'll get exactly what black people got.  Yeah.  Is it happening now?  No, it's not. 
[02:10:30]  No, it's not.  Not to the extent it is with African-Americans, sir.  And there was people that said for a long time that interracial relationships people  were against.  And it's like if you tried to legislate against, aside from white fathers, if you tried to  legislate fucking interracial relationships, people would think you're fucking crazy.  Right.  They'd say you can't do that.  But a lot of times, like Frank calls up and goes, that's not a good comparison only because  they're against gay marriage and they've got to find a reason to say the comparison is 
[02:11:00]  wrong.  Yeah.  No one is saying that gays were made slaves.  Why would you say that?  No one's implying that.  Let's finish up the Prop 8.  I like Jimmy's point on that one.  We've got to finish the Prop 8 up with this fine clip from one of our favorite actors of  all time.  Oh.  We're bringing a little comedy into this.  All right.  The Supreme Court said that our marriage.  The Supreme Court.  Well, see, we're still able to fuck each other in the assholes, but other people can't legally. 
[02:11:30]  The Supreme Court said that our marriage is.  I recycle my own spurt.  I can't do the voice.  Aye, Captain.  And, uh, solid.  However, other gays and lesbians cannot get married.  So, uh, it's, um, a decision to be indecisive. 
[02:12:00]  This ruling does not affect our marriage.  It's solid.  And, uh, the Supreme Court has stated that, uh, they're not ruling on the validity of our  marriage.  It is valid.  Uh, so, uh, we are fine.  We are more equal than other gays and lesbians.  And we are fighting for equality.  American democracy guarantees equality and justice.  And there are other couples that are being denied that equality and justice. 
[02:12:30]  It is a fundamental issue of civil rights.  Uh, equality for gays and lesbians, bisexual, and transgender people is the great civil rights  struggle of the 21st century.  Is it?  And, in this case, the California Supreme Court failed that test.  Wow.  George DeCat.  Hey, if you don't like gays, I think you have the right to not like gay people.  You have the right to fucking think it's disgusting.  Like, whatever you want to feel is cool.  Yeah.  But you can't fucking... 
[02:13:00]  Can't infringe.  Infringe on people's rights to do what they want to do.  It's amazing.  How many people want selective enforcement?  I'm starting the United Federation of Homos, where we will go through the galaxy, freeing  homosexuals from oppression.  Ah, the movement will just regroup.  They'll regroup and figure out the next, uh, you know, the next way to get this done.  But nobody wants to admit they're a repressive prick.  Nobody wants to admit, like, you know what? 
[02:13:30]  I want certain rights, and I just don't like that motherfucker.  I don't want him to have them.  Right, right.  They have to find reasons, well, no, but it's this, no, but it's that.  You just don't like something, and you don't want other...  The same people that would scream if this show was taken off the air for content, well,  let me do what I want to do.  Let me enjoy what I want to enjoy.  What about fags getting married?  Fuck them!  Jesus Christ, what a chest that guy had.  I was quite buff in his Star Trek days.  That's when I was going crazy and took a sword through the hallways. 
[02:14:00]  Why is his body glistening in?  I don't know.  It's fucking stone arching on him.  Oh, it's wonderful.  Ooh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Don't get any of that.  That's how I sneeze.  Now I jump out and see.  I'm going to fuck you in your ass.  He looks really gay in this fucking clip.  He's so gay.  I'm ripped.  Look at the guys just bagging up.  They don't want any part of the gay sword.  Look how gay he looks. 
[02:14:30]  Oh.  Yeah, this is the episode where the whole crew kind of went a little crazy.  He's got a sword, and he's shirtless, and he's chasing a couple of men down the fucking...  Obviously, the hallways of the fucking studio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That episode was referenced in the movie, by the way.  Oh, really?  Where Sulu has to fence.  He goes, yeah, I'm good at...  He goes, can you fight?  He goes, well, I know how to use a weapon.  And then on the way down or something there, he asks him, what do you use?  He goes, well, fencing, because I know how to fence. 
[02:15:00]  It's fencing.  He knows for real, though.  Yeah.  It's not a body double.  He's good with a sword.  Mr. Spock is just worthless, standing there with his big ears and his fucking heart on  for...  What's her name?  Oh, Uhura.  Uhura.  He grabs Uhura.  He's like, I'm...  George Takai.  Do you have a cock?  Yes.  Okay, then get away.  Ah, Kirk's jumping.  He must have loved this scene.  There we go.  Just to choke him.  Spock just gave him the fucking Vulcan nerve pinch there.  That's all it takes.  Now he's on the floor on his back, waiting for a good Vulcan teabagging. 
[02:15:30]  He would love Spock's fucking planetary balls on his nose.  His green balls.  Yeah.  A little pointy fucking ball bag.  I bet you Spock has a pointy cock head, and it's probably like fucking five inches long and  thin.  Vulcans have awful dicks, and they don't get hard.  I don't know that.  Just the head swells up.  Oh, look.  It's his first time.  Yes, I'm screaming.  Why is he screaming?  In great pain.  Because I'm getting one in the ass for the first time.  It's great that Kurt was freaking strangling him, choking him out. 
[02:16:00]  He was choking him out.  Give him a little.  We're going to go to break.  The phones are lit.  We can continue on this after the break or get into some other things.  We'll figure that out.  We've got to play the Norm Macdonald clip.  Oh, no.  When you talk about Prop 8, Norm Macdonald comes to mind.  That's a great picture right there, Danny.  We'll continue in just a bit.  One time I was doing this thing in San Francisco, and they were all gay people in the audience,  they told me.  So I figured I'll do it.  In San Francisco?  No. 
[02:16:30]  So I figured I'd do stuff about gay people so that they could relate to it.  Yeah, it's warm up.  They love that.  And so I was talking about, because I went to this gay pride parade, and I saw in it  there were these old men and old ladies with these signs that said,  We are proud of our gay son, you know?  And so I was saying, that's an odd thing to be proud of, you know, because it's not an  achievement, you know?  It's not like something you work all your life to be gay or anything like that.  And I just wondered, I had a hard time believing that these 50, 60-year-old men are actually 
[02:17:00]  bragging, you know, at work, like they're, hey, Bill, you know?  You know, my kid, oh, my God, we're proud of him, Johnny.  He graduated from Harvard, you know, first in his class, you know what I mean?  Now he's articling over at a law firm, and, oh, yeah, he loves cock.  He can't get enough cock in his mouth, his ass, this kid's always cock. 
[02:17:30]  I got a picture of the boy here sucking another man's cock.  Come on, I'm sure it's a...  You're going to be proud of him.  So watch the maturation of you as an artist to realize it took you nine and a half minutes  to get around to the second cock stuff.  It's beautiful to see you comfortable in your own skin, Normie.  All right.  We'll be in Anthony. 
[02:18:00]  Are the American Idol dudes coming by SiriusXM today?  That's what I'm hearing.  Yep.  Will we get him for a couple minutes?  No.  No, we won't.  No, we shan't.  I want to address something that Kenny brought to my attention.  Yes.  I have upcoming gigs, which I haven't promoted yet, in Florida, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm  Beach.  June 19th, 20th, West Palm Beach Improv. 
[02:18:30]  You wouldn't know that because I'm not on their website at all.  Why?  I don't know.  And June 18th in Fort Lauderdale.  I am on their website.  And here's the bio that they put for me.  It's a good one.  Jim has appeared on the nationally syndicated Opie and Anthony Radio Show.  He has performed feature spots on MTV's Jim Brewer Show and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man.  He has opened many times for Andrew Dice Clay. 
[02:19:00]  Are you kidding me?  That's the bio they put for me on the Fort Lauderdale Improv website.  And the person that wrote that doesn't know much about you, Jimmy.  And I understand that they don't.  But to put...  I haven't appeared on the Opie and Anthony Show.  I'm on the Opie and Anthony Show.  For the last eight years or so.  You sure appear a lot.  Yeah.  And I have performed feature spots.  I did one spot on...  Can somebody Google what year Jim Brewer's show on MTV was? 
[02:19:30]  Oh, my God.  I did one spot on that.  That's got to be ten years ago.  Easy.  Makes it sound like you haven't done anything in years.  And I didn't perform a feature spot in Spider-Man.  No.  I had what they call a five and under.  I had one line.  And I have...  How about your HBO specials?  How about your books?  How about things like that that you could actually make it look like, hey, Jimmy's been doing stuff in the past ten fucking years?  Tough crowd.  Lucky Louie.  Jay Leno.  David Letterman.  Because exactly what happens is, if you don't sell tickets, the clubs get justifiably angry. 
[02:20:00]  But it's like, who would go see this guy?  It's like...  That's great.  Come on.  Look.  You're a brewer.  Yeah.  Didn't Brewer's show.  He's been on that show.  What show?  Seven Tonight Shows.  Two Lettermans.  And I've never read my credits before.  Two Carson Daly's.  How about HBO?  How about the Half Hour on HBO?  Or Down and Dirty?  Or Kimmel?  Or something.  Two years on Tough Crowd.  Two books.  Something that's happened after the millennium.  Right.  Except for the O.P. Anthony show. 
[02:20:30]  So let's call him up.  Which you, you know, appear on.  And it's probably not the club.  It's just their web guy.  Doesn't know.  But someone should be checking his work.  1998, Jim Brewer's show was.  That was 11 years ago.  I did one spot on Jim Brewer's show.  And that's in the fucking...  But it's like, guys, you want to help sell tickets?  It's a great club.  I've done it once.  I'm only doing it one night.  Oh, my God.  I'm not saying it should be a special event that people are going to fly in for.  And I'm not listed at all on the West Palm.  So just so you know, if you're down in that area, I will be at those clubs.  But, you know, if you want to get tickets, call the Improvs. 
[02:21:00]  Because you're not going to get them through their websites.  Yeah.  Obviously.  There you go.  I also see on the website that they have you having appeared at Devil's Creek.  You know, come on.  Let's get this millennium here.  Tired of those all-inclusive vacation packages to overcrowded Caribbean beaches?  The hottest vacation spot is practically in your own backyard.  Visit Devil's Creek in the heart of downtown Edison, New Jersey.  Here's the founder of the Devil's Creek Tourism Board, James Norton, who's going to share with you some of his fond memories of this beautiful vacation destination. 
[02:21:30]  I have a really weird, vague memory of my pants around my ankles, on the steps in this apartment building.  There's an older boy.  An older boy who used to make me suck his penis.  He's got to be older.  I think he tried to fuck me in the butt once, but it didn't work.  First, you'll fly into picturesque Newark, New Jersey.  Then you'll whisk away southbound on the scenic New Jersey turnpike to beautiful Edison Township, where you'll be a hop, skip, and a jump away from Devil's Creek, where your fantasies become a reality. 
[02:22:00]  It was these twins.  I would get both of them at different times to sit on my face, because they used to pee their pants.  So I liked that smell.  Yeah.  And that would make them sit on my face behind the bushes so I could smell.  I remember my one friend, I was sucking his penis, and we got caught by another friend.  He's the same one that...  Fucking crazy.  He's the same one that urinated in my mouth.  For memories that'll last a lifetime, even the suppressed ones, come visit us at Devil's Creek.  I don't even think I got erection to that age.  I can remember my friend's penis getting erect, and me wondering, why'd that happen with his penis?  I didn't know what that was. 
[02:22:30]  It was in your mouth?  Jesus Christ.  The whole of our kid.  Devil's Creek.  If you don't leave crying, we're not trying hard enough.  Wow.  That sounds like a great place.  I hate the fact that that piece comes after the gay marriage segment.  Yes.  People are going to start tying things in unnecessarily, and they don't need to.  I think this Devil's Creek's going to take on a life of its own in the coming weeks, huh?  Yes, quite the tourist spot.  That's right.  They forgot to mention that in the bio. 
[02:23:00]  Jim has appeared on the Jim Brewer Show and got muddy knees.  Worst bio ever.  It's horrendous.  Yeah, it really is.  They fucking dropped the ball on that one.  It's dropped the ball.  They fucking stuck a knife in it and went.  Just laziness.  Just laziness.  It's just laziness.  Teacher in North Carolina caught with 15-year-old student.  We've seen these stories before, huh?  Hotness.  You've got to see the picture, usually.  I don't know.  I have not seen the picture of this teacher yet, but the newscaster just messes up the  teleprompter. 
[02:23:30]  Really?  As well.  So you've got a couple things going on in this story.  27-year-old Jessica Wishnask made her first appearance in court this morning.  Police say early Saturday morning, a patrol officer spotted a suspicious vehicle on North 5th Avenue.  Inside, he says he discovered Wishnask in an intimate contact with a 15-year-old boy.  And Pitt County School spokeswoman Heather Mayo tells us that Wishnask resigned Monday from  her job as an 8th grade English language arts teacher at Pectolis Elementary School.  New Hanover County School's assistant superintendent for human resources director, Dr. John Wellmers, Jr., 
[02:24:00]  says Wishnask resigned in December as a 7th grade English language arts teacher at Houston Middle School.  She's a fucking news person.  Resignined?  God, what a dumb bitch.  You know what's great about that story?  She got past a really difficult last name like 10 different times.  And resigned, tripped her up. 
[02:24:30]  The easy word.  She couldn't figure it out.  I've got to hear that again.  Resignined.  How did she say it?  Resignined.  At Pectolis Elementary School, New Hanover County School's assistant superintendent for human resources  director, Dr. John Wellmers, Jr., says Wishnask resigned in December as a 7th grade English  language arts teacher at Ruliston Middle School.  How do you pronounce it?  Resignined.  Resignined.  Resignined. 
[02:25:00]  That G will screw you up every time.  Oh, yeah, well.  Fantastic.  I got to hear it one more time.  Is she hot, Ed?  It's one of those would you.  Let me see.  It's a would you picture.  Would you?  The would you game.  Oh, no, not her.  Is that her?  I saw the other one, Danny.  You tripped me up.  You made me look silly.  Oh, wow.  She looks.  That one looks stoned and.  I don't know.  Fucked up.  You know what the problem is? 
[02:25:30]  For real?  The really flat hair.  Yeah, yeah.  She got no.  A little too much conditioner.  She needs some bangs.  She needs.  She's got droopy eyes.  She needs to open those fucking eyes and probably lose a few.  I don't know.  Her job as an 8th grade English language arts teacher at Pectolis Elementary School, New Hanover  County Schools Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources Director, Dr. John Wellmers,  Jr., says wish not resign in December as a 7th grade English language arts teacher at 
[02:26:00]  Williston Middle School.  Well, I'm not saying we would do this, but how many more times can you hear that?  For real.  Resignine.  I'm in for at least six more times.  I love her.  Reservoir dogs.  Resignied.  Residents.  She should hang out with Rich Voss.  Hey, no, who was that other chick?  Yeah, there was a hot chick.  Danny.  Who was that other chick that was up on the thing? 
[02:26:30]  She looked like the girl from Baywatch that had some drug problems.  You had had another girl up there.  Jasmine, right?  Yeah, up top.  Who's this one?  See, now this is a would you because she's kind of.  This is another situation of a.  She's I.  She's more than I.  Or something is going on.  She's more than I.  Yeah, like she's really not put together there.  You clean that shit up, she looks good.  I bet she cleans up good, yeah.  That's the one I was looking at where it was like, would you?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, okay. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, that's easy.  That's making sure.  That's an easy would you.  All right.  The other one, duh.  No, the other one, not.  But if you're 15 and she's your teacher, yeah, then you're fine.  You're very, very happy.  Very flat, dead hair.  A religious school teacher was charged over the weekend with sexual battery  on a teenager hours after the two returned home from a trip to Disney World.  Happiest place on earth.  That's a good one.  Dave.  Oh, yo. 
[02:27:30]  Dave B. from Philly.  Oof.  I saw the picture.  She's going to do some time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's going to jail.  Hot teachers don't do as much time as early teachers.  We learned that a while ago.  Nope.  Oh, the reporter wasn't stammering over resign.  She was using auto-tune.  A little hero from Kentucky, right?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  I could look at that picture.  I know.  The eighth grade elementary school, question mark.  Oh, my God.  That is ridiculous. 
[02:28:00]  Hot.  Yes.  What'd she do?  Like an afternoon in jail?  Dude, she did.  That's LeFavre, right, Debra?  She didn't see a day.  She picked up some litter in the judge's office.  Oh, my God.  That's all she had to do.  Look at that hair is blowing.  Yeah.  Oh, the face of an angel.  You can't send that to prison.  No, that'd be ravaged.  Stop it.  It's cruel and inhuman.  I love that bit, too.  And then we showed the real ugly teacher that they're like, 18 years to life. 
[02:28:30]  18 years for this pig.  Right.  But LeFavre here, oh, my God.  Those legs.  You know, I don't yell and scream breast implants, but someone like LeFavre?  Nah, she's good.  You pop a couple implants in there?  Hey, Bill, what do you got?  She's good.  Oh, we lost Bill.  He had a good line, too.  Oh, well.  That is the funniest fucking thing.  And there's she's with a stupid husband who couldn't give her the deep dick and she needed. 
[02:29:00]  She just ran off.  Yeah.  She's like, I need some fucking kid to give me a deep dick.  There are so many pictures of her on the internet, man.  Yeah.  Amazing how many fucking pictures of her.  Any recent pictures, though?  Smiling.  Is she in jail now or no?  No.  Oh, man.  Is that her right there?  Where?  That was her?  Yeah, I do believe so.  Fuck.  God damn it.  Damn it!  God damn it.  Holy shit. 
[02:29:30]  I put that right up there with Popeyes.  Fuck, is that correct?  Popeyes fried chicken.  Oh, I'd be licking my fingers more.  Oh, mmm.  Thank you.  Thank you, old dear friends.  For coming to my birthday!  The greatest.  Absolutely.  Fucking Pee Wee.  Those pictures are amazing.  But let's say hi to Bill.  Bill, how are you?  Oh, Bill!  Hi, Bill! 
[02:30:00]  You guys there?  Yes, Bill.  I think so.  A couple of things.  Nobody mentioned that I just got done TiVo on a show that Jimmy did on Comedy Central.  I haven't had to watch it yet.  But earlier, Jimmy touched on the equal and fair under the law thing, and I heard this morning that the state of Kentucky, as of Monday, they're no longer offering the driver's tests in the 22 languages that they've done in the past.  As of Monday, as of Monday, it's going to be in English only.  Good.  Good. 
[02:30:30]  You hear that?  Wow, English only, huh?  Good.  And that's good, considering all the traffic signs are in English.  I agree with that.  So, yeah, it's going to be interesting to see what the other states are going to do here.  And no more smiling for license pictures, apparently.  Why?  Oh, yeah, I heard that, too.  No smiling for license pictures.  Why?  No smiling anymore.  Why can't you smile?  Why?  Because you could look different if you smile.  Huh?  So they want, like, fucking mug shots on your license now.  They want you to look like you're going to look when the cop is talking to you through a window. 
[02:31:00]  Exactly.  You're not going to be like, eee, eee, eee, unless you're drunk.  If you smile, they pull you right out, I guess.  Good for Kentucky.  Should be in English.  Yeah, Kentucky's one of those states that could get away with it, though.  New York, places like that, you're not going to get away with shit like that.  That'd be an uproar, or outrage, or something rage, roar.  They'd be all pissed.  But shouldn't you be able to read, like, the road signs?  They get pissed off when someone wants to fucking cover their face and show their eyes through a slit 
[02:31:30]  and take that as their license picture.  And that had to be in court, wasting our fucking time and money.  Unbelievable what some people put the court system through and the taxpayers.  Should have thrown that woman right the fuck out.  She wants to wear a burka.  A bur-bur-bur-burka.  And take her license picture.  You're going to drive with that stupid thing on your head?  Well, yeah.  How the hell is she going to see?  I don't know. 
[02:32:00]  Just look at her little slit.  No, it's a little screen or something, I think.  It's crazy.  Don't they have the screen?  Robocop.  The little fucking slit she's looking through.  Look through that slit.  I can't get enough of looking at Debra LaFave.  Jesus Christ.  It's great.  Dude, she is the most photographed person on the internet.  It's every...  There's hundreds of thousands of pictures of her.  Check out...  Check out...  Someone is saying...  I don't even know.  We're going to go into this cold...  Wedding thing.  Check out Heather Lynn, L-Y-N-E. 
[02:32:30]  That always means something, that Lynn.  Heather L-Y-N-E, Z-O.  I don't know why we're checking her out.  Is she another teacher that got in some trouble?  How do you spell that last name?  Z-O.  Z-E-O.  Oh.  Is this a teacher that got in trouble?  Let's see.  Hang on.  Um.  Well...  It's mostly your Facebook is public.  Well... 
[02:33:00]  I'm not seeing anything yet.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  What the fuck, dude?  What's wrong with this guy?  Fail.  You fail.  That better not be her.  What the hell?  You're wasting valuable radio time.  Yeah.  It is.  Come on.  We were just looking at pictures of Deborah LaFou...  LaFouverie.  You fucking...  What's her problem, Dan?  I see there's a news article, so that can't be good. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Charged in sex case.  Uh-oh.  What'd she do?  Police say that Z-O-37, a married math teacher from North Penn High School in Lansdale, admitted  having sexual relations with a 17-year-old student last month.  She also left sexually explicit internet and phone messages for another student earlier  in the year.  Blah, blah, blah.  What a dummy.  Well, it's nothing really.  Nothing new.  Nothing new, and she's not hot.  Nah.  God, they're fucking students.  How hot is that, though?  Well, that's, you know...  Fucking teachers are so... 
[02:34:00]  It's great.  How much...  That's coming out a lot lately.  Did this always happen?  Dude, it's all women lately.  I think it's always happened.  It's just that now we're at a time where, you know, Facebook's getting you in trouble,  text messages are getting you in trouble.  I think back in the day, you just...  How did anybody know?  It's a hot topic.  And if a kid said something, it was like, well, prove it, but now there's the proof.  You know, he's very troubled and disturbed in class, and he has a problem with me.  I think that's why he's accusing me of this.  But when you got an electronic trail of sexually explicit photos... 
[02:34:30]  It was like, you're from a .gov email address.  Yeah.  That's probably a problem there.  Good point.  All right.  Moving on.  Oh, no shit about this one.  The Miami Herald, a little newspaper we all know, is saying Twitter poses a risk for newspapers.  No shit.  Yeah.  Newspapers are done.  They're going broke everywhere.  When I look at the newspapers in the morning, I'm like, this is old news. 
[02:35:00]  Like, this is old stuff.  Already read it.  And then I go to the internet and find new stuff.  Yeah.  Like, they lose.  Newspapers lose.  There's nothing they can do.  Unless they figure out how to do it online and make money off it.  I mean, they're doing it online, but they can't figure out how to make money off it.  I go to CNN and I go to Drudge.  Those are like the big two.  And then I'll go to, you know, FARC and other things.  But to get, like, whatever news is happening right now, the important stuff, two sites.  And I know everything that's going on in the whole fucking world.  Yep. 
[02:35:30]  I don't have to thumb through goddamn ads in the paper.  Get ink on your fingertips.  Stupid stories about shit I don't care about.  Look at this.  It's not stupid stories.  It's just old stories.  That's all old news.  And that's today's paper.  Look at this.  A Macy's ad.  There's something called, I think, Breaking News on Twitter.  So I follow that, right, Ant?  Yeah.  Anything happen in the world, it's right there.  It pops up.  Boom.  Oh, really?  I'm informed.  Thank you.  Wow.  Yeah.  I don't need newspapers.  We're just used to newspapers. 
[02:36:00]  That's all.  We're just used to them.  Yeah, because we're the younger generations.  They don't really understand a newspaper.  They probably look at it like, that's stupid.  Right?  That's stupid.  This guy's still fucking backing this Heather.  What is he trying to say about it?  He said, wrong one.  This is the right one.  And it's the same one.  You're an idiot.  What is he saying?  Is he trying to say she's a hot teacher?  There's, there's, I've seen uglier. 
[02:36:30]  Wrong Heather.  But you can't go from Deborah LaFour.  No.  To this one.  Of course not.  Deborah LaFour, he is hot.  She's ridiculous.  It's stupid.  Deborah LaFour or five or whatever it is.  She's just as hot as Christina Applegate in her prime on Married with Children.  Yeah.  She's hot.  Equally as hot.  You might be right.  And I was a big fan of Christina Applegate.  Yeah.  This Deborah is hotter.  Wow.  Back in the middle.  She's hotter. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  Oh, was she, uh.  You guys want a little entertainment news?  Yes.  What's happening in Tinseltown, as they call it?  Oh, good God.  Didn't David Spade have a show where he was going to really take it to Tinseltown?  Oh, was he going to set them straight?  What happened there?  Oops.  No one cared.  Holy shit.  Come on.  That's Photoshopped.  I don't know.  Someone shot that.  I could tell.  There's too much dark between the cleavage.  The internet's cruel.  Showing a picture of her younger with her boobies still.  They took tits, they lowered the opacity on it, threw in some fucking, uh. 
[02:37:30]  Opacity?  Opacity.  No, it might be a word.  I just never heard it.  It's the, how opaque something is.  And then they added in some darkness around there and then recolored it.  I've done it all.  I do it all the time at home for my own purposes.  No.  Hey, uh.  God damn it.  There's a website we're supposed to check out today and then some feedback came up.  Um, if, if he's still out there, what was the, the site called?  Was it called cockknockers.com? 
[02:38:00]  No, this is a favorite of mine and Travis's.  Oh, well, when are you going to share with us, Dan?  Well, because this isn't something that you share with other people.  It's, uh, it's cockdockers.  Oh, okay.  Cockdockers.  Cockdock.  That's different.  Let's check out cockdockers.  All right.  It's the ridiculousness of docking.  It's just a bunch of docking.  Do you really need a whole website called cockdockers?  Yes.  What do you do when you're docking?  I don't understand it.  Except look silly.  You look silly.  Like, you'll be standing there. 
[02:38:30]  Uh, you could have your oral.  You could have your anal.  You could manually stimulate.  You could do, there are other things.  Docking is like, once you're done, you just look at each other.  It doesn't seem like there's any pleasure in it.  Well, what happens is, um, I imagine after you dock, like, you look at each other, and  then one of the guys goes, look at that.  And the other guy goes, I know.  Yeah.  And then you just both go your separate ways.  And then you're done.  Well, you both piss.  Oh, wow. 
[02:39:00]  That'd be, uh, an interesting contest.  Hey, Dan, you got a favorite picture?  Knowing that it's you and Travis's favorite site.  Well, it's not that our favorite.  It's just that, uh, we've, we've Googled, like, docking, and this site comes up a lot.  But, so, uh, when I saw the feedback come in, I actually highlighted that feedback and  put it up by his desk.  Looks like a boa eating a python.  Jesus.  It's like sausage links.  Oh, shit.  Probably smells like them, too.  Yeah, guys are fucking disgusting.  All right. 
[02:39:30]  I'm against gay marriage now.  Why, these are not married people.  Married people don't dock.  No.  They fuck in the ass and make salads.  We don't dock anymore.  Now that we're married.  You don't bring me foreskin anymore.  Oh, God.  You're not a fan of the cockdoggers?  Uh, no.  From what I've seen so far, you know, take it or leave it.  Sounds like a sitcom family name. 
[02:40:00]  Cockdoggers.  Cockdoggers.  The wacky neighbor next door that always comes over with his foreskin pulled out.  Yeah.  Makes a funny remark.  Hello, Jerry.  Slides in and just clips over Jerry's cock.  Stop with the docking.  I don't want to be a cockdogger.  I don't want to be a docker.  Wow.  Of course.  Framer slides in.  Is he holding his foreskin over?  He's a docker. 
[02:40:30]  He's a docker, Jerry.  So, you tried out docking Jerry.  George, I don't want to dock.  Thank God we pulled the curtain so we could look at the cockdoggers website.  This place stinks.  What the hell?  What is going to happen if someone walks by and sees silly photos of guys docking?  Come on the window.  The fuck?  It would be funny when we turn around and there's eight guys just jacking off on the window.  And there was another channel over there with no DJs currently on the air.  Exactly. 
[02:41:00]  I just don't understand that policy.  You're doing radio shows in this environment that's supposed to be a bit edgy to begin with.  And we got to make sure the curtains are pulled to look at guys docking?  It's not the old days.  Exactly.  Who the fuck did this?  Human resources?  Lawyers?  They used to keep the production facilities and the management facilities apart from each other in radio.  Remember that?  You used to have the jock lounge and the little hallway and then the studio and shit like that.  And the program director would be somewhere. 
[02:41:30]  And then sales and stuff.  You'd have to go to an entire different part of the fucking building.  Now everyone's on top of each other so you've got to pull the curtains.  I miss the days when people would just walk in on horrific shit going on.  Whoa!  What the fuck?  What is that?  Wow, that guy's gravely outmatched in docking, by the way.  There is somebody.  That isn't quite docking.  You see some real Davian Goliath happening.  You really got to study your penis before you go into the docking world. 
[02:42:00]  You got to make sure you're up for the challenge.  That's a quarter-twenty nut trying to go on an eighth-inch bolt.  As an eighth-grade English language arts teacher at Pectolis Elementary School, New Hanover  County Schools Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources Director, Dr. John Wellmers,  Jr., says Wischnaps resigned in December as a seventh-grade English language arts teacher 
[02:42:30]  at Williston Middle School.  How do you resignide, by the way?  You turn in your resignidation.  That's when you have a stroke as you're resigning.  Like to resign online.  I'm the Mr. Marshall.  I'm resignidating.  Look, that's obviously a brain fart, but even when you're brain farting, you never come up  with a word you've never heard before.  You try something.  You resign, you left.  Right.  Quit.  God forbid you should make a joke about it and go, I can't believe I just screwed that word 
[02:43:00]  up.  Yeah.  Is there a G in that?  Reza, Reza, Reza.  How much docking can you look at?  How many different versions of two guys with their dicks locked together can you possibly  take?  I tap out at the 1,500.  They're saying that about all the straight people.  Like, how could you look at another one of those things again?  Yeah, what, oh, a vagina again.  How many different ones do you need to see?  That's true.  At least you're getting two guys in this picture. 
[02:43:30]  With a girl, it's like one vagina.  And you could just look at a thousand of them and not be tired of it.  All right.  I wasn't looking at it with a homo point of view.  I'm glad I was able to provide one.  Thank you, Dan.  No problem.  Why does Maury have a giant rabbit on his show?  That is a big bunny.  How cute is that?  That thing is huge.  I want to pet it.  I'm going to sniff it.  I bet he's soft.  Where do you find giant rabbits?  I like to cave his head in with a bat.  Yeah, that's why I pet him and distract him.  And when he starts to crinkle his nose, you sneak up with the aluminum. 
[02:44:00]  Yes.  A thud.  And why is Maury rerunning a Christmas show?  Yeah, Maury's out of material.  Look.  It's Christmas.  Wow, that's a giant rabbit?  Look how fucking big that giant rabbit is.  That's Photoshop.  No, I don't think this one is.  I remember reading a story about this guy.  He actually breeds them for food.  The rabbit's head is bigger than the human's head in this picture.  It is.  The guy is a chunky guy, not a fat guy.  And the rabbit is as big as his entire torso.  Isn't that a little forced perspective? 
[02:44:30]  Come on, Ant.  Maybe he's holding it a little closer to the camera than he is.  Wow.  The feet are weird.  It doesn't look like they're hanging right.  I don't know.  I don't buy it.  It's a big rabbit.  Maury doing animal stuff.  Maury is charmless.  Isn't he?  He's a charmless man.  He can put on all the Christmas colors he wants and make all the wacky.  There's an animal on my shoulder face.  Yeah, it just ain't working. 
[02:45:00]  He's a charmless exploiter of filth.  He's a ghoul.  All right, let's play U-Choose.  I'm not believing that.  You want to play U-Choose?  Those are giant rabbits, man.  No, look at the head.  Look at that ear.  It's giant.  No, that's a giant rabbit.  I've never seen a rabbit that big.  We're an international show.  Someone call up about giant rabbits.  I think they're fake.  I'm going to pet one.  Go to Snopes.  Do you want parents interrupt teens meltdown on cam? 
[02:45:30]  That's always good.  I love a teen meltdown.  A woman finds God in her salami.  We're doing a little cleanup today.  We have a lot of stuff in front of us.  We haven't gotten to.  Another God in the food story.  And look, he's carrying it.  Oh.  But that doesn't look that big.  No, that one doesn't look that big at all.  That's huge.  Oh, it's big.  It's big, but not as big as the one that you've shown in the still pictures.  Someone bring us a goddamn giant rabbit.  Dead or alive, I don't care.  Or father accused of biting out kid's eye.  Wow, that's a good one.  The choice is yours. 
[02:46:00]  That's a good one, but I go with teen meltdown.  Why?  Because that's always funny, listening to fucking some spoiled brat get all pissed at something.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, that means nothing in the scheme of life.  And then we'll go with the father biting out the boy's eyeball.  I went with a woman finds God in her salami.  No.  I hate this.  This was me.  You were crying out loud.  God damn it. 
[02:46:30]  I hate this.  Scott, kill it.  Go offline.  Scott.  Scott.  What?  Go offline.  Go offline.  Who was on the phone?  Nobody's on the phone.  He was on his channel.  And he's acting.  He's having his.  Scott.  God damn. 
[02:47:00]  When did he turn off his computer tonight?  Cut yourself off, Scott.  You're not.  Scott, Scotty.  This is stupid.  You're being stupid now.  Now you're going and showing, putting yourself up there with someone to laugh at.  God damn.  Where are your brains, boy?  Having a meltdown online?  You were online.  Where are your god damn brains?  You were online?  Yes.  He was on his frickin' channel, whining and crying and acting like a three-year-old to the entire world. 
[02:47:30]  Where are your god damn brains?  Like I said, you don't understand.  No, you don't understand.  You're making an ass of yourself for all of eternity.  For all of eternity.  And the father's just as stupid because he's still on camera, right?  Yeah.  That's why we got the audio off.  Now he's an ass.  Is that the kid?  Yeah.  Why is the cat playing piano every so often?  Because that's the new internet thing that has to happen now. 
[02:48:00]  Like at every, instead of like fail or LOL or lulls, it's the cat playing the keyboard.  It's not even playing it.  The cat's falling asleep on the keyboard.  You know something has reached the masses when CNN starts reporting on it?  I saw a CNN piece about keyboard cat and like where the cat is.  Really?  Because CNN wants to be so cool.  CNN is fucking irrelevant.  You don't understand.  You don't understand what I'm going through.  Shut it.  Scott.  Scotty. 
[02:48:30]  Scott.  Where's your brains, boy?  That's pretty funny.  Your brains, boy?  That's pretty good.  There were no internet when I was a kid.  Daddy?  Yes, sir.  Pamela Rogers Turner.  They're saying even hotter.  I think I remember this.  Don't say Debra LeFavre.  She is.  Don't say hotter than LeFavre.  She is the pinnacle of teachers having sex with students.  Holy mother of Christ on a pony.  Oh, yeah.  I remember her.  Wow.  What's her name?  Yeah, they should be in. 
[02:49:00]  Look at her.  She's cuffed in that picture.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get another picture.  Yeah, this could be a split decision, my friends.  Oh, my God.  They look like they could be almost sisters convicted of the same time.  Yeah, they both got the blonde hair.  She's got the nicer boobs, too.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  I hear she was sentenced to one day in her room.  That's the ugly broads.  Brooms up their twats in prison for 10 years.  Yeah. 
[02:49:30]  Well, what do you think?  Not as good as LeFavre.  Yeah.  LeFravre.  You still go with LeFravre.  I go with LeFravre.  Some pictures of this chick is unbelievable.  Pretty damn good.  And then other ones.  Tough call.  That is tough.  Boy, how do you present that?  Well, I guess you present it as pretty as possible in court so that the judge would be like.  I remember this lady now.  Wait, she got busted.  Wait, I think if I recall correctly, this was the one that got.  She got busted once, got off, and then got busted a second time sending like a striptease video to some kid. 
[02:50:00]  Yeah.  And she got off of that one, too, didn't she?  I hope so.  I hope she just continually gets away with it.  Oh, yeah.  She could do it as many times as she wants.  Oh, the kangaroo.  Now they got kangaroos on Mori.  Yeah.  Mori could give a shit.  And a little kinkachu.  Aw.  Cute little animals.  What's Mori doing?  Ha, we're going to try to find its mother. 
[02:50:30]  You are not the father.  We got more on the meltdown.  Aw.  The meltdown of that kid.  Holy shit.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What is she doing, Dan?  That's the teacher?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Holy shit.  This is the striptease she did on her cam for the student.  Look at her ass.  Holy shit.  Would you?  How do you ever let that out?  Why don't you just fuck her and keep your mouth shut?  Would you?  Did you just say, would you?  Dude, I'd fuck her if his head was in the way.  Oh, my God. 
[02:51:00]  Look at that friggin' move she's doing.  Thank you.  Thank you, all dear friends.  For coming to my birthday!  Can I just be the first one to say I can't wait for it to be my birthday?  I know.  We need more birthdays.  You know, we haven't even used the clip properly once today.  I just throw it in because we have to.  My friend.  We've got to figure out how to use that clip.  Oh, it's a birthday clip.  It's just fantastic.  Yeah, but it's fantastic.  What, are we going to use it four times a year, five times a year? 
[02:51:30]  I know.  Wow.  That is a great little striptease video she's doing.  It's on YouTube.  Kiki, K-I-K-I, or Kiki, Kiki.  Kiki.  Ta, new word, T-A.  Yada, Y-A-D-A.  And this is.  That kid was crying about the San Jose Sharks losing in the NHL playoffs?  According to Nick D in Philly? 
[02:52:00]  I thought he was having a meltdown over a girl or something at school.  Yeah, you would think it was something important.  I knew it was going to be some spoiled idiot with no, uh.  What do we got on Kiki, Ta, Yada?  Nothing.  Nothing on Kiki.  No, not even Kiko.  Nothing, huh?  K-I-K-I?  Yeah.  I love when people do that.  They send you shit that goes to nowhere.  You people are morons.  Interrupting our good fucking pictures. 
[02:52:30]  All right, let's move on.  Here we go.  Here we go.  A woman finds God in her salami, father accused of biting out kid's eye, or video released  of retard fight club.  All right, you know where I'm going with this.  Come on.  God in salami.  All right.  No!  What?  If we don't get to the retard fight club at some point, I've got to hear retard fight 
[02:53:00]  club.  Can we open up the curtains?  It's creepy when we're in here with the curtains drawn.  I can't put docking pictures.  I know.  I'm looking at docking pictures.  Look at Kenny right on the spot.  I'll open it.  He's a fucking, he's a charmless man.  It's amazing.  I've never seen a man with less pizzazz.  Hold on a minute.  We got a very important phone call coming in. 
[02:53:30]  Dustin?  Hey.  Hey.  It's my birthday.  It's your birthday?  Yeah, it's my 30th birthday today.  Is it really a 30?  Oh, my God.  Happy birthday, Dustin.  I really wish we had something for you today.  What are you going to do?  Oh, boy.  What are you doing for your birthday?  I'm driving.  I'm a truck driver.  Oh, but you should play that clip.  What clip?  I think there was a something.  I wish we had something for that guy.  Fucking Jim, you pray. 
[02:54:00]  Retard fight club.  We are getting our first look at some disturbing images of a brutal fight club.  Maybe for you.  Brutal.  Disturbing for you, maybe.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Brutal.  I lost a lot of money in this club.  I kept betting on Tongues McGillicuddy.  He looked like the fucking odds-on winner.  He would come in wearing just a pair of ill-fitting shorts.  No shirt.  Perfect bull do. 
[02:54:30]  I'm like, this guy's got to go undefeated.  He didn't know any better.  He kept punching himself.  I'm like, McGillicuddy, you're doing it wrong.  Then he spun in a circle like a Tasmanian devil and got dizzy and threw up on himself.  He vomited fucking, he vomited a small change and soup.  Tongues McGillicuddy.  You punch him and his little belly rattles because he eats quarters.  He actually bites them in half.  You got to think. 
[02:55:00]  Tyler Burden.  Rockhead.  Rockhead.  Kirsten.  K-I-R-S-T-E-N.  Kirsten.  Oh, we're finding another. 
[02:55:30]  Boyle.  B-O-Y-L-E.  Should we lay it to Susan?  Sound good.  Come on.  Bring it on.  Again, nothing.  What do you guys...  Come on, man.  You people suck a dick.  You doc.  Anything good?  You're a bunch of dockers.  Nothing?  All right.  Bit over.  You guys can't play at home.  No, you can't play.  You don't know how to play.  Here we go.  We are getting our first look at some disturbing images of a brutal fight club held at a state 
[02:56:00]  school for the mentally disabled in Corpus Christi, Texas.  The story is clear at how poorly people can treat the disabled.  Last week, a grand jury indicted six former employees of the school for organizing fights  with the residents.  Police believe the late night fights were on for at least a year.  And all were captured on camera.  Late night employees made the videos themselves using their cell phones.  The faces that stick with me are the face of one man who was being chased through ruins 
[02:56:30]  and he was so afraid his yelling was almost guttural.  Police obtained the video last March.  They say the six employees who've been charged are the ones who were identified in fights where  there were clear injuries.  Where can you see these?  I don't know.  In that place, MMA is an organization.  It's something they yell. 
[02:57:00]  MMA!  Again, employees like that.  If you're doing that, why do we have to even put them on?  If you're making retarded people fight, you should just have your hands cut off.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's disgusting.  We're not harsh enough in this country.  Of course not.  No, apparently not.  Is this commercial?  And then the videos come out.  Boy, they've really just invaded the internet with full-length, full-size commercials. 
[02:57:30]  And not even appropriate.  If this is for the retarded...  Yeah.  You want your car dealership...  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, fight club.  It's going to be a commercial for electrical outlets.  A shitty one from New Orleans writes, first drool about fight club.  First drool?  What are we looking at now?  I have to...  Ah, I got the story.  Oh, we got to see the video?  Night shift workers use their cell phones to record residents awakened after midnight and 
[02:58:00]  forced to fight.  The employees can be heard laughing and prodding the residents who they supervised to fight harder.  Not only are they prodding them to fight, when they run away, it's like a pack of wolves  chasing, you know, the weak and the helpless.  Residents were told that if they didn't fight, they might be sent to prison.  And they were warned if they told anyone, even their parents, they faced punishment. 
[02:58:30]  They say snitches get stitches.  What do you think they meant by that?  Men's like, if I snitch, they're going to beat the mess out of me.  Six former state workers have been fired and indicted by a state grand jury for causing  injury to a disabled person.  Authorities discovered the videos when one of the night shift workers lost his phone.  Oops.  And police opened it to find the owner.  Looks like Michael Vick and his pit bulls, except they treated these human beings like  dogs for their pure enjoyment. 
[02:59:00]  A federal civil rights investigation last year...  If only one of the retarded kids would have ate that guy's phone like he was supposed to.  Never found it.  All right.  Dan, we're going to try one more time.  Poor retards.  Wow.  One more time.  I know.  Ooh!  Ding-Dang's knocked out by a book.  Let's see.  Let's see.  What are we doing?  Hold on a minute. 
[02:59:30]  Hold on.  Kelly?  Huh?  Brooke.  Oh, that was right at the top.  Not a teacher, but very hot.  All right.  What is this for, though?  What the hell?  I don't care.  Get the naked one on the beach where she's covering herself up a little bit.  Thank you to that.  Or one of the bikinis.  Let me see her.  Let's look at...  Hmm.  I'm a little confused by this one.  Yeah, yeah.  That's a rough shot.  You should be screaming and yelling she's hot because she's covering up her naked boobies 
[03:00:00]  on the beach with a little bikini butt.  Let's look at something else.  She's got some giant titties.  She's going for a Raquel Welch look almost.  She's pretty.  Her hands are up over her head, though.  None of us are, like, jumping up and down about this.  No.  She doesn't beat Lafayette.  Give me one more.  Lafayette is hot because she's just the regular teacher.  Right.  This is obviously a model. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah.  Oh, pretty good there.  That looks pretty nice.  You've got to give her that one.  Her tits are actually too big and round.  I don't like...  Yeah.  They look like fake tits.  Yeah.  It looks like rising dough at a pizza place.  You know the only way to really test a girl's tits is just to kind of, like, jiggle them  a little and take a big shit in between them.  Is that the same girl?  Supposedly.  Topless?  Not bad.  Nice tits.  Dan Ariel.  A-R-I-E-L. 
[03:01:00]  The Little Mermaid?  Rebel.  R-E-B-E-L.  All right.  Now we're just getting into, like, porno girls.  All right.  Well...  Let's see.  Pop up a pic of her.  See what this is all about.  Okay.  She's one of these fairly legal looking girls.  And the curtains are open.  Oops.  Oops.  Curtains are open and we're looking at porn.  Oops.  It's not porn.  It's art.  Which curtains?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  It's curtains for you. 
[03:01:30]  All right, Ant.  All right.  Stinky Fridge Makes Workers Sick.  Stinky.  No, Dan.  Back over here.  You might as well Google it.  Something dumb will come up.  Swedish Girl with Down Syndrome Sings Opera.  Dead Fat Lady Removed on Flatbed Truck.  I think opera gets an audio.  Yeah, yeah.  We go more retarded.  Yeah?  I like the stories with the retarded. 
[03:02:00]  All right.  I don't know why.  I think we played a piece of this, but this is just terrific.  Thank you. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, dear friend.  Fuck off me, do my bad day.  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up. 
[03:03:00]  I hate you.  Wow.  Oh, God, that's her?  Yeah.  Wow, she looks like Susan Boyle.  Dude, that's how Susan Boyle's supposed to sing.  She looks like Devine.  She is horrible.  Tony, one of the good guys from XM.  Oh, look at that.  Tony. 
[03:03:30]  Love Tony.  What if he just ran and threw himself out the window?  Tony, what's up?  They did our hair to try to make her look good or something.  Hi, Tony.  How's Tony doing?  Curled that head.  You good?  I'm good.  Ah, nice to know.  A little visit from Washington?  Yeah, a little Washington trip.  Oh, boy.  That means someone's getting fired.  Got your credentials there.  Oh, boy.  You need your credentials.  He's all right.  It's okay.  Mars is going to be all right?  He's going to be all right.  I hope so.  Mars makes the cut? 
[03:04:00]  Is this breaking news?  For now.  No, not yet.  Not official.  All right.  All right.  All right, Tony.  Thanks for stopping the show.  Oh.  I guess you're checking out the studio, huh?  Nice?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Thank you, Tony.  See, he's a real soldier of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  You didn't want to do this to us, right?  Not quite the studio you guys had built for us back at the other place, huh?  Remember the multi-million dollar state-of-the-art studio that you built for us and we were 
[03:04:30]  proud of, Tony?  Yeah.  They think this is okay for us.  Just because there's screens everywhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And if we bitch about it, we're the problem.  Yeah.  That makes sense.  Hi.  Yeah.  Look at Tony.  This is classic.  He's just kind of looking around.  He ain't saying shit, but I can read faces.  Yeah.  This is what they did.  Gentlemen, to your show.  Enjoy your program.  This is what they did to us, Tony.  See?  See what they did to us?  Look what they did.  Look what they did. 
[03:05:00]  Look at where they put us.  They massacred us.  Look at them massacred our studio.  This is the famous hallway you looked at, huh?  Yeah.  I want you to use all your skills to make our studio bigger.  I don't want the listeners to see them like this.  Just in case people thought we were crazy.  See what Tony did?  Bye, Tony.  Yeah.  Nice, Tony.  Take it easy, sir.  A true soldier for real.  We're all soldiers here, because we never know when we're going to get a bullet in the 
[03:05:30]  head and remove, similarly removed from the building.  But where are the problems?  You want one more before the break in?  Yeah, one more choice.  All right.  Bruno's, what is this one again?  The Bruno thing?  I don't know.  He was doing some fake MySpace thing he was doing called Mind Space.  I don't even know if we're going to have that as a choice.  Let me see what we got here.  Let's do that lady with the God and the salami. 
[03:06:00]  I'd rather have the father biting the kid's eye out.  Oh, yeah.  That's true.  They're both food stories.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm going to add another one to the choices.  Sam.  Putting headphones on.  I guess this is a...  Oh.  You must have something important coming in without us.  You must have something to say.  Telling you to come in.  No, I was just here in case you needed any help with the Bruno clip.  Oh.  What's the Bruno clip about?  Well, it's just one of his viral videos that's going along.  He started...  He has, like, all the social networking sites, except they have German names. 
[03:06:30]  And so he has a MySpace that's masked to Mind Space and stuff like that.  But he put out...  I'm winded from running down that hallway.  You're too young to be winded.  It's a long hallway.  What the hell are you guys?  What are you doing?  You're a kid.  I've done, like, four laps down that hallway today.  Four laps.  How old are you?  25.  You shouldn't be winded at 25.  No.  But I've ran down that hallway too much.  You don't smoke.  You're not even a fat guy.  That's even weirder.  You're not fat.  You don't smoke.  We've got to get a closer office.  It's too far.  You don't eat bacon-a's? 
[03:07:00]  I eat bacon.  Oh, you like bacon.  Dan, check out Mothers in Heat.  Jesus Christ.  I hope my mom's not on that side.  Oh, how embarrassing.  Mothersinheat.com.  Got to love this one.  Blogspot.com.  The old .blogspot.  Thank you, John Field.  You'll meet me.  What's this about?  What's wrong?  She's in there.  What is this thing about?  Just women and mothers in heat? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, that's the teacher right there.  Is it a list of teachers or just in general?  It looks like a list of older women who, not just teachers, but just older women in general  that got in trouble.  Yeah, that got busted doing it.  Who's on the top of the list?  I mean...  The top is Tracy Conley, 39-year-old mother from Hamilton.  Pig.  Blah, blah, blah.  Charges streaming from sex acts with underage boys ages 13 and 14.  Friends of her own children.  What do you think the motivation is there with the women that do this? 
[03:08:00]  With the men, there is some kind of twisted reason that they're...  What is that thing with the women, with the younger boys?  Probably somebody.  They want someone who they can talk to who isn't going, all right, already, after three  seconds.  They want a guy that jizzes every 15 minutes.  Is that what they need?  Just loads and loads of jizzes.  Stiff as a board every fucking second.  She's just got to touch his dick. 
[03:08:30]  Dan?  Yep.  We're going video now.  All right.  Oh.  Thank you, Snuffy the Trucker.  Little.  Don't thank him yet.  Lupe.  L-U-P-E.  Caged.  Lupe.  So, so far we've got Little Lupe.  Caged.  Tuck or no tuck, Lupe?  Anal.  Little Lupe. 
[03:09:00]  Caged.  Anal.  All right.  That should close the curtains now.  Why?  Why are we closing the curtains?  Well, because I'm seeing jizz on the face.  All right.  We got it, Dan.  Oof.  Here we go.  Lupe.  Little Lupe.  Caged anal.  Caged.  This is a stupid fake cage.  Fast forward through this. 
[03:09:30]  Well, Lupe does.  Are they both?  This is legal, isn't it?  I don't know, man.  Hold on.  Lupe looks pretty little.  Really?  Nah, I think he's pretty little.  Oh, good God.  Don't say that.  He just looks that way.  Hold on, Anthony.  He's wearing little butterfly wings.  This is coming in.  What would management say?  Uh-oh.  Bring in the gimp. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, the gimp's coming in, ringing a bell.  How long is this video, though?  This is...  It's 15 minutes.  Directed like shit.  Well, how about you get to the dick in the ass instead of the fucking story?  Well, you can't slide the fucking...  I can't slide the slider over.  You can't slide?  That sucks.  Why?  Fuck.  I hate when they do that.  Well, I can't.  That is stupid.  That is stupid.  Oh, I don't care about this.  You want me to try to find another side?  Yes.  You know what?  During the break, how about Denise? 
[03:10:30]  Jimmy needs to see, they're saying.  So let's see what this is about before we go to break.  I want to see Loopster take one in the shitter.  Jimmy needs to see Denise Massino.  M-A-S-I-N-O on freeones.com.  What's freeones.com?  Massino?  She's a bodybuilder.  She has a big clit.  You know her?  No, she is.  No, I've seen her.  She's a big pussy, I think.  Oh, my God.  Danny just made a weird face like he just drank sour milk.  That can't be good.  Oh! 
[03:11:00]  What the fuck?  Dude, come on now.  That's a guy.  That's a little too big.  That's a guy.  There is testosterone pumping through that clitoris.  It made it into...  She could dock.  That used to be a guy.  Come on.  No, that's a woman with just the stuff she's taking.  No way.  That's an enlarged clitoris.  Yeah, but look at the rest.  Does it give you guy's hips and guy abs?  That's from her working out.  She's got muscles.  That's a guy's body. 
[03:11:30]  That's horrific.  What the fuck?  You don't want...  Oh, dude.  Oh, God damn it.  What the fuck?  It looks like one of those fucking clams we brought in.  What were they called?  Gooey duck.  Gooey duck.  She's got gooey duck clit.  What the fuck?  We were having fun, man.  Yeah, how did this start with Devil Lafarve and we end up with that?  The shit.  That wreck. 
[03:12:00]  All right, we'll take a break.  Farmer ring.  Oh, the other one I wanted to add to the list?  Yes, the cleanup.  We're doing well with the cleanup.  We've needed to do this for a long time.  Mother gets back at girl her nine-year-old daughter is fighting with by putting the girl's phone number in a Craigslist sex ad.  Poof.  Come on.  You decide which one we go to next.  Opie and Anthony.  What are you looking at over there? 
[03:12:30]  A little pornography.  I'm on slutload.com.  Slutload.com.  Yeah, apparently.  Yeah, there's that news girl or what was her name?  She was some kind of news girl and what?  She went in the truck with the boys?  Went in the truck.  The news truck with the guys?  Yeah, and one of the camera guys filmed her, I guess, taking care of herself.  And then at some point, word has it, they prop the camera up there and then he comes over and gives her the old... 
[03:13:00]  Eh, this could be it.  Uh-oh.  Gives her the old dick and...  Oh, man.  This is a very...  It's a good video.  Something very hot about this video.  She's pretty hot, no?  Because it's just taboo.  Oh, boy.  Oh, look what she's doing.  How did I miss that?  Oh, my God.  I slid forward too much.  Well, she's playing with herself, and then the next second, she had a big dick in her  mouth.  I slid over too far.  How do you...  Now he's coming to walk over, I guess. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, well, a little dick in her mouth.  What the fuck is that?  You think she had to resign or resign?  She was resign-ended.  Why would she suck that?  There's nothing going on.  What's wrong with this guy?  Jesus Christ.  It's time for him to be the star, and he's got nothing.  He's not visually stimulated at all?  He's got a gangly little leg.  Add it to the treat list.  Nice, though.  Turkey chili from Cafe Metro here in New York City. 
[03:14:00]  Do I have some, too?  One of the great treats.  Kenny, I love turkey chilies.  Oh, good God.  Kenny, I like turkey chilies.  Smell that.  Smell it.  Oh, that's good.  That's good stuff.  Smells like diarrhea.  Smells like smoking.  I'd love to smell a Diet Pepsi, too.  Okay.  Diet ginger ale, actually.  He sure is getting bossed around.  This guy ain't going to be able to do anything with this limp dick.  That guy's dick is awful. 
[03:14:30]  Nothing there.  Oh, we're still doing the show?  Yeah, something like that.  Here's a cute little story.  Cute story.  I love an acute story because it means it's not.  No, this one's funny.  I love how this works itself out sometimes.  You'll understand in a second.  Maybe we can get a list of these stories if we feel like doing some research.  Man named Beverage.  Last name is Beverage. 
[03:15:00]  B-E-V-E-R-A-G-E.  For real.  Uh-huh.  Charge with DUI.  Oh, okay.  I love when these things work out.  Thank God his name isn't come as a...  A 50-year-old man with an unfortunate last name, given the circumstances, was arrested  at 3rd Street and 51st Street, 3 a.m. last night after a breath alcohol test asserted  he was at nearly three times the limit.  Wow.  Whoa.  Randy Joe Beverage is his name. 
[03:15:30]  Registered a .23.  Wow, that's a good one.  And a .19.  Nice.  I knew it was ironic because he was hanging out with his friend Pete Rape.  Pete Rape.  There you go.  Beverage.  Randy Joe Beverage.  Perfect.  Likes his beverage.  He sure does.  Getting pretty loaded.  That happened to my friend Larry Tallboys.  Oh, my God.  Does the guy, the camera guy, having sex with our looks... 
[03:16:00]  He did.  He's not into it.  Larry Tallboys.  He looks like Billy Mac.  Holy shit.  It's Billy Mac.  Billy Mac better call up and explain himself.  All right.  Yes, more cleaning house.  All right, what do you want?  Who's this fucking murderer that just walked into the room?  That's...  Are you a new intern, sir?  Yes.  You are?  Yeah.  All right, let's see if this works.  What's your name? 
[03:16:30]  Dennis.  Dennis?  Yeah.  I'll try to remember that.  We're going to ask you in 20 minutes.  I'll never remember.  Dennis.  Dennis.  You totally nailed him.  That's the best gag.  It's got such longevity.  It really is.  It's always appropriate.  Call someone's name when they're leaving the room, and then just turn around.  Don't acknowledge them.  All right.  Woman finds God in her salami.  That's still on the table.  Yeah, let's see.  That's probably going to be the go-to story now, right? 
[03:17:00]  Father accused of biting out a kid's eye.  I want that one.  Dead fat lady removed on flatbed, or mother gets back at girl her nine-year-old daughter  is fighting with by putting the girl's phone number in a Craigslist sex ad.  Oh, that's good.  That's kind of...  Oh.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  It's kind of sexy.  Which one do you want?  Craigslist.  That's the one I had in my hands. 
[03:17:30]  Which now, you know, is home of murderers and rapists, apparently.  Man, they shut it down.  And arrested guys for just trying to make a living.  Yeah.  By pimping out whores.  Yeah, by exploiting girls into a life of sex.  Might have a drug problem.  Neighbors in this quiet part of Long Island drop their jaws upon learning of the  unbelievable Craigslist crime.  Police say 40-year-old Marjorie Tenenbaum, a licensed psychotherapist, placed a fake sexually 
[03:18:00]  suggestive ad in the casual encounters section of the website.  The ad read, looking for a good time?  Woman for man.  21 years old.  When sex-hungry responders emailed, investigators say Tenenbaum gave them the phone number for  her daughter's nine-year-old classmate.  Police do believe a feud between Tenenbaum's daughter and her Mount Pleasant elementary classmate  motivated the mother's vindictive classified ad.  Investigators are not yet sure if the ad was meant to lure men to the child classmate or  to the classmate's mother. 
[03:18:30]  In all, more than 20 men called the nine-year-old's home looking for casual sex.  Oh!  She must be a great psychotherapist.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow!  I have father issues.  Kill him.  She's good at the psycho part, not good at the therapist part, perhaps.  What is the best part of that story?  Uh, that people called up.  Danny?  Yeah.  Nine-year-olds.  Just the idea of people calling the house is pretty twisted. 
[03:19:00]  Maybe the two best words in the story.  How many do you have to answer?  The two best words in the story.  Sex hungry.  Oh, yeah.  Sex hungry.  They had to pump that up for everybody.  Sex starved.  Who's here?  Things like that.  Sex hungry.  Wow, this video is really getting hot and heavy.  I haven't turned it off yet.  What's Billy Mac doing?  Billy Mac is holding a dildo as she squats down on it. 
[03:19:30]  And, uh, she's got a really nice, uh, body there.  Oh, it's fat.  As far as, uh, now Billy Mac is, wow.  That's what he's doing with that thing.  Billy Mac's working a, like, uh, he works the bilge pump on his boat.  He's trying to.  What's he doing with his own worthless little penis?  Just hanging there like a pig's tail?  Wow, he, like, is slamming that thing, uh, pretty deep.  My God.  That's pretty good.  Did she get, when did this come out? 
[03:20:00]  Well, it's black and white, so it's got to be the 50s.  No, that's kind of color.  That's black and white.  That's in color.  Oh, I don't know.  Now the dildo's away, and, uh, we'll see if Billy Mac can perform.  Billy Mac.  Is it, is it time for him?  Allison Williams?  Is that who it is?  What did she used to be on?  There's a, uh, yeah, local West, uh, I think it was West Virginia, uh, local news station.  Wow.  W-V-E-C or something like that. 
[03:20:30]  Great, um, head there.  She's doing a good job at that.  All right.  Are we moving on?  Right down to the balls.  What?  A woman finds God in her salami.  Uh-huh.  Fight at a Waffle House.  Can I add a, uh, a couple?  You're adding a new one.  See, I like that.  You add a new one, and it's like, oh.  That's what you think you know, right?  Oh, fight at a Waffle House is pretty good.  That's probably not a good white trash.  Man puts cow abortion drug in girlfriend's Gatorade.  All right.  All right.  Look. 
[03:21:00]  Wow, she must have been a fat chick.  How do you get this done?  Three people have been charged with criminal attempted homicide.  It's all part of a plot to end the pregnancy of a teenage girl.  WTAJ news reporter Ben Manning did some digging into this case.  He joins us live from the newsroom.  Why do you say digging like that?  With the latest on this.  Because he was in the dumpster.  In the, uh.  Abortion.  It's an abortion story.  He said she was in a bad mood. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, God.  With the latest on this very strange investigation, Ben.  John Carolyn, this is the case where police say a Williamsburg high school student put a dangerous chemical in his pregnant girlfriend's drink.  He thought it would kill the child she was carrying.  Luckily, it didn't work.  And police say they're just now filing charges because they had to send that poison Gatorade to the chemical unit of the FBI. 
[03:22:00]  The Blair County District Attorney's Office filed charges against Jonathan Emler Sr. and two juveniles.  Police say they were all involved in a plot to end the pregnancy of a teenage girl.  Police say a high school boy put prostamate in his pregnant girlfriend's Gatorade.  It actually happened inside Williamsburg High School on March 31st, 2008.  Prostamate is a prescription drug that farmers can use to abort cow fetuses.  Why do you need two friends involved? 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Well, look out, maybe.  For what?  Here's your Gatorade.  Drink it.  I mean, while you're putting it in?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Put it in there, shake it up.  Procure it?  Perhaps.  The DA charged all three with criminal attempted homicide of an unborn child, aggravated assault, and theft.  But only Emler is being tried as an adult.  Police say Emler helped the juveniles steal the prostamate and was involved in planning the whole crime. 
[03:23:00]  Police say this is a new one for them.  I have not seen it in this area.  This is the first time that I believe that we investigated something of this nature.  People in the community are glad charges are finally being filed.  When this first happened, I think the community all was just so devastated because it was hard to believe the things that you were hearing that that could possibly happen.  Councilwoman Becky Mingle says it's a sad situation for everyone.  And she's glad the plan didn't work and the girl and her child are still doing fine to this day. 
[03:23:30]  These young adults, they need all the support that they can get to be able to, you know, get through these situations like this and hopefully have a, you know, a future ahead of them.  That was kind of a dud.  Well, it's a pretty twisted story.  It was a dud, though.  What are we supposed to do with that one?  Jesus.  Run through our repertoire of abortion jokes.  Yeah, the one friend milked her, the other friend put the stuff in her drink.  The other friend made fucking steak out of her hiney. 
[03:24:00]  Dan?  Awful me from Wackbag.  Got another one?  Look up.  I think it's a me.  A-M-I-E-E.  Amy?  Yeah, I think that's Amy.  Oh, yeah.  A me.  You should resign.  I must resign.  Yeah, that is Amy.  No shit, Sherlock.  And L-U-I.  L-U-I.  Amy Lou.  It's going to be an Asian girl?  Let's take a look at Amy. 
[03:24:30]  Amy Lou.  Oh, Jesus.  Better go back to the last one.  What about that first pick?  Is that her with the ponytails and stuff?  Well, no, that's somebody else.  That is somebody else.  That's it.  That guy was...  What are you doing?  Don't send us names that aren't...  All right.  What regular chicks?  Come on.  No models.  Stop it.  Stop it.  What else did we have?  I liked one of the other choices. 
[03:25:00]  All right.  Let me see.  The...  The...  The...  Stinky Fridge Makes Workers Sick?  No.  Dead Fat Lady Removed on Flatbed?  It could be good.  Or Sam's Hip Hop Interviews?  I like our little Sam.  Who did he interview?  Anyone big?  Rick Ross's Baby Mom.  Oh.  And Method Man and Red Man. 
[03:25:30]  Baby Mom might be good.  That might take too much time.  I saw Method Man in the airport.  I should have said hello to him.  I was such a fucking dick.  Yeah, I saw your tweet.  Tweet?  He was in The Wire.  He was great.  Tweet.  He's like, why didn't you...  That's right, he was.  You're the kind of guy that goes up to people.  I know.  Because you know why?  Because I've met him before, and he loved me on Lucky Louie.  So you got an in.  No, I know, but I was so full of shame that he wouldn't remember me, and that would just  look stupid.  It's the difference.  When you're asking for an autograph, you usually do look stupid.  I didn't want an autograph.  I already, you know, I don't need...  Or a picture.  I already got a picture with him from MTV. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, then fuck him.  Where's all your autographs?  I keep them on the windowsill outdoors.  No, I keep them in, uh, just in a drawer.  Yeah.  Like a little box I have, you know, at a safe place, signed photos.  I separate them very carefully.  I take, uh...  You're all catalogued.  Last time I was at your house...  Alphabetically listed.  It's a good idea.  Your house is starting to look like a museum.  It is.  Really?  I like my stuff displayed, yeah.  A lot of stuff.  What else am I going to put on the wall?  Painting?  I don't look at it.  Flowers?  Eh, some guy did this. 
[03:26:30]  It's a duck looking at a fucking pond.  Eh, dog looking one way, another dog looking the other way.  That I'd put up.  Yeah.  Yeah, that is, um...  So, like, I got a lot of the signed stuff and things like that.  I gotta wait till, uh, something's built downstairs.  So I can't really...  The whole motif of my house isn't really conducive to put shit up.  Well, I need more than...  I have a one-bedroom apartment, but there's not a lot of wall space.  There's a lot of windows.  I don't know where to hang stuff. 
[03:27:00]  Hang them on the windows.  You can't do that!  Use nails.  And then complain that the glass keeps breaking.  That's overreacting, Jim.  Who the fuck would do that?  Oh, it's overreacting, Jim.  That would be funny to fucking put a nail through.  I'm just trying to hang a picture.  Found a flying ant the other night.  You ever spend hours trying to determine if something's a flying ant or a wasp in your house?  Wow, that's scary.  Yes, it is.  I don't like wasps.  I finally put it in my mouth and let it fly around.  See what it would do. 
[03:27:30]  I'll show you a picture of it.  You tell me.  You took a picture of it?  Yes, I did.  Uh-oh.  Well, you find the picture.  Mike R. from Toronto.  Is this going to be a big lump of shit?  No.  We want regular girls.  Mike R. suggests prisonchicks.com.  Are they real prison chicks that you can get mail letters to?  One look and we'll know if they're real prison chicks.  That's a wasp.  That looks waspy.  Wasp.  Now, if you look at flying ants, they look a lot like that. 
[03:28:00]  Ants don't fly.  Sorry, this site is not currently available.  Wow.  Prisonchicks.com is up for grabs?  No.  Did you spell it right?  Someone has it, but.  Oh, with a K.  With a K?  Mm-hmm.  Right.  That's prison chic.  Well, yeah, but this one didn't work, so I tried the other one.  No.  What do we got on prisonchicks.com?  Nothing.  Nothing.  What the fuck are you doing to us, guys?  Come on, you idiots.  We have to count on you sometimes.  C-H-I-C-S.  All right.  Gotta is in capital letters, Ant, so we're going to try one more. 
[03:28:30]  Green lighting.  Lightning.  You gotta look up Yulia.  Y-U-L-I-A.  Oh, boy.  This ain't going to work either, I bet.  Oh, and we got the correct spelling on that Amy chick, too.  Nova.  N-O-V-A.  Nova.  I taught you to smile.  Oh, God.  What is this mess?  Wow.  Wait.  Look at the size of these.  Oh, come now.  What's wrong with you? 
[03:29:00]  You have mommy issues if you want boobs that big.  Wow.  A big boob is all right, but those are giant.  Oh.  She's a...  Stop it.  Dan, what do you think?  Would you bring that girl to a family outing?  That's one of my favorite bits we haven't done justice to.  Family outing?  Well, you bring your big-titted new girlfriend to the family outing, and everyone looks at  you because they know why you're with her.  And they're just like, oh, look at the size of her tits.  Someday we'll develop that bit properly. 
[03:29:30]  Right?  Yeah, where it's...  Because your family's not going to sit there and go, oh, let me guess, you're going out  with her because of her personality?  Yeah, she's got like fucking 18 inches of cleavage.  And she can't fit into the summer clothes too well.  You got the cool uncle that comes up to you when you're alone and goes, hey, uh-huh.  Good job, huh?  Hey, hey, hey.  How many times in your titty fuck those?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, here she comes.  Melons.  She got a sister?  Yeah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  You know, your aunt's got cancer.  Oh, shit. 
[03:30:00]  Your uncle just ruins it.  All right, we're going to go with the real Amy thing.  Puta loco?  I don't know.  Amy.  A-M-A-I.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  M-E.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah.  A-M-A-I.  Uh-huh.  And we still go with the Lou.  L-I-U.  All right.  Nothing, Dan.  God, what's wrong?  Our tastes are different than our...  Let me see one with the chick because she's got the little braids in her hair. 
[03:30:30]  They're trying to make, yeah, like a barely legal thing, but she's Asian, so she's, like,  weighs three pounds.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  And...  She could take a cock.  Looks like an angel fuck.  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Stinky fridge makes workers sick.  Yeah.  Woman finds God in her salami.  Father accused of biting out kid's eye.  Still want to know what that's about.  Fight at Waffle House.  I don't know why that would be here. 
[03:31:00]  Fight at Waffle House?  I'm starting to think this could be the...  Can't just be a fight at a Waffle House.  Right.  I'm thinking that might be good because fight at Waffle House, we'd throw this in the garbage.  Like, who gives a shit?  If maybe they have funny accents or affectations on their voice, maybe.  And dead fat lady removed on flatbed.  That's pretty good.  Why don't we try the Waffle House?  I'm thinking Waffle House.  Let's try Waffle House so if it sucks, we could bail.  I have confidence in the guys because fights at Waffle Houses happen every weekend.  Exactly.  So there's got to be something special to this fight in a Waffle House. 
[03:31:30]  Let's give Waffle House a day in court.  Run up the flagpole.  An early morning run for breakfast at the Waffle House turned terribly wrong for Crystal  Samuel.  I thought it was going to get me an all-star.  All right.  Popular rail on the menu.  I think...  Wait, what happened?  I think now I see why this clip was chosen.  I was too busy thinking of bacon salt.  No, the sound quality is very good.  Oh, what?  Yeah, yeah.  That's why they chose this clip.  Something about when the interview started.  Oh.  Everybody want a piece of my chicken. 
[03:32:00]  Something fried chicken.  Baby, love it.  Yeah.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  An early morning run for breakfast at the Waffle House turned terribly wrong for Crystal  Samuel.  I thought it was going to get me an all-star.  A popular meal on the menu.  Grit, sausage, toast, eggs, and a waffle.  While she waited for her order, her friend started eating.  That's when Samuel says she was told they couldn't eat from carry-out trays inside the restaurant. 
[03:32:30]  What was you fussed about?  I said, we didn't pay for our food.  She said, y'all got to leave.  I'm like, how you want us to leave?  And we didn't pay for the food yet.  It got ugly after Samuel says she threw a waffle at the waitress.  I did actually threw the food, but it didn't hit her.  She threw a fool?  She drove across the counter.  And we got into it.  Clarendon County Sheriff Randy Garrett says the altercation continued outside.  Well, he says 29-year-old Waffle House employee, Akeisha Ward, got a gun from her car.  Poor judgment on her part.  What?  I didn't settle this matter with a weapon. 
[03:33:00]  Investigators have charged Ward with assault and battery with intent to kill after they  say a bullet fragment struck Samuel in the arm when the weapon discharged.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That's a good one.  What a bunch of lunatics.  She threw foo at her.  Well, she had toe.  She had toes.  She had some toes in her.  She had some toes, but you can't stand there and eat your toes and the rest of your foo  in the takeout container. 
[03:33:30]  I understand exactly what happened.  They're waiting for the next order to come out, and this pig couldn't fucking wait to  get out of the place.  You either stay or you go.  You can't sit there and eat your foo here.  What kind of thing did she want?  An all-star.  An all-star.  No, Grand Slam.  I'm on the all-star.  Was it a Grand Slam or an all-star?  A Grand Slam is Danny's.  No, no.  This was just some local while we were around.  Yeah, Danny's is another problem.  They have other issues at Danny's. 
[03:34:00]  Google.  N?  No.  Oh.  What the fuck is it?  God damn it.  Busty.  Oh, this is going to be some big-titted monster.  Marilyn.  M-A-R-I-L-Y-N.  Busty Marilyn?  Yeah.  Marilyn!  Now, Grandpa.  How busty is Marilyn?  Oh, God.  Oh, stop it!  Damn, Marilyn's a busty girl.  More mommy issues. 
[03:34:30]  Someone didn't get breastfed.  Yeah.  She's chesty.  Someone needs to snuggle up in those and fall asleep in the fetal position.  No sex, just sleeping on big boobie pillows.  Because somebody lacked a little attention.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  How do you have sex with that monster?  Those tits are in the way.  Dan?  Yeah.  Thamy.  T-H. 
[03:35:00]  This is from Snuffy.  Wait, Snuffy did us wrong already, didn't he?  Yeah.  Motherfucker.  All right, we'll give you a shot.  Thaney.  T-H-A-I-N-E-E.  All right.  That's it.  Um.  What is this?  Another one of these Polynesian fucking waifs?  Flat-chested tiger.  I don't know.  Where are you going to get this?  Snuff?  You, you, you fucking.  Snuffy!  All right. 
[03:35:30]  You start talking to her and some guy does kung fu on a motorcycle and steals your camera.  Let's try, uh, Snuffy, Snuffy gave me a third one.  We're out, Snuff.  You're out.  Let me go to the phone.  You sucked.  Yeah.  Boo.  You're out.  Change your name.  Let's say hi to Bill.  Bill?  Hey, what's up, Dave?  Oh, Bill!  Hey, I got a one for you.  It's whatboyswant.com.  What boys want.  Wait, that's Dasha? 
[03:36:00]  That's Thaney.  Snuffy might be back in the game.  That's Thaney.  No, no, no.  That's Thaney.  Oh, that's Thaney.  All right.  I apologize to Snuffy.  No, it's not that bad.  Thaney's not bad.  It's in that picture, but.  All right.  We're at whatboyswant.com.  Yes.  Whatboyswant.com.  Other men talking.  We're just hoping for that one website or one picture that just shuts the show down.  Candy.  I don't like any sites with the name, with the word boys in it.  Yeah.  Trust me, you guys will like it, and if you guys want, I'll give you a password for it  on there. 
[03:36:30]  Well, Bill, where do we go for the freebies?  Well, it's a fucking page with little thumbnails.  Yeah, we don't even know where to go on this page.  Too many words.  There's a lot of words.  Porn sites shouldn't have a lot of words.  We want to put in an address, hit it, and just see nudity.  Right.  Okay, well, go off there.  I'll give you the password for it.  Well.  Well, it's a little too complicated.  We're just trying to do a fun little quick bit here.  You can't go hold and password.  What the hell?  What the hey?  Oh, all right.  Wait, Danny might have found something.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  All right.  All right.  Click on one of those down there with her hands on her breasts. 
[03:37:00]  It says, yeah, that one.  No?  Unclickable pictures?  Just slow.  Unclickable thumbnails?  That's all right.  All right.  Oh, not bad.  I'm kind of liking that.  We're looking at amateurs.  A little slutty girl in the shower?  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  What are they doing there?  I don't know.  They're going to bathe together.  They're going to bump donuts.  Hey.  Well, I've walked in on you in the shower, girls.  Well, I'm sorry. 
[03:37:30]  What have we got here?  Oh, tub girl.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yes.  Yes.  Who's this?  This is Gail.  Hi, Gail.  We haven't heard from you in a while.  What's going on?  Hey, not much.  Yeah?  How's things?  Getting ready to have surgery.  Oh.  Surgery on what, Gail?  Goodness, Gail.  My back.  Your back?  Yes.  What seems to be the problem with your back, Gail? 
[03:38:00]  I have three bad discs.  Oh, three bad discs.  Oh, that's a shame.  Three bad discs.  Thoughts and prayers.  Thoughts and prayers to you.  Thank you very much.  Gail, what can we do for you?  And what channel are you listening to?  Tell the fine folks out there what channel are you listening to.  I'm listening to 60 on 6.  That's right, Gail.  You're one of our regulars.  We love Gail here at 60s on 6.  Yeah.  Do you like Flash?  60s on 6. 
[03:38:30]  You like Flash films?  Yes, I do.  Yeah.  Flash is great, isn't he?  He's all right.  Like that 60s music, do you?  You like the Mamas and the Papas?  I do.  Yeah.  I'm dedicated to the one I love.  Yes.  Yeah.  That is a good one.  That was the great Mama Cass Elliott.  Yeah.  Who we just heard a recording from, her last actual recording.  But fantastic, Gail. 
[03:39:00]  Well, when did you start listening to the 60s here on 6?  About a month ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you just love that era of music, huh?  I do.  Remember when you were 70?  Yeah.  Oh, good gravy.  Wow, that is nice.  Gail, what kind of song can we play for you?  I wanted to hear Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying.  Oh, what's the matter, Gail?  You've got to be a little more up than that. 
[03:39:30]  Sure.  Well, uh...  Not that son, Uncle Paul.  That's because I lost my husband, and that's a good song.  Oh, goodness gracious.  Gail, I hope that wasn't too recent.  You know, not that time...  You know, time does heal all wounds.  We've got to remember that, Gail.  Okay.  We've got to remember that.  How long ago did your husband pass?  It's been 11 years, but it seems like yesterday.  Aw, doesn't it, though?  Gail, when we lose the ones we love, it's so tough. 
[03:40:00]  Where did he die from?  It really is.  How did he die?  He had brain tumor.  Oh, my goodness gracious.  That's terrible.  Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that, Gail.  Yeah, they've...  As a matter of fact, with the 60s channel,  that took the great George Harrison also.  The great George Harrison.  So you could take solace in that, I guess.  Yeah.  You know, that they died of the same awful disease.  Right.  My goodness, that's terrible.  One will remember for eternity, the other one we forgot about the day. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  What else, Gail?  Yeah, tell us on your list.  I love listening to y'all's channel.  What do you like the best about it?  I love all the music that y'all play.  Yeah, you like the, like, so happy together.  Right.  Wow, hold it, Danny.  Don't move that.  Holy.  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, Jesus.  60s were a great time, weren't they, Gail?  Could you print that out for me?  They were. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, yeah.  What do you do in the...  Does it...  Do you reminisce when you listen to the 60s music?  I do.  Yeah?  What does it remind you of?  What were you into in the 60s, Gail?  Mainly singing with music.  Really?  Do you remember the Summer of Love, 1968?  Let's have her sing a song.  Yeah.  Times are different now with this thing, like the internets and things.  I don't have time for any of that garbage.  I like the way things were, Gail.  I like the simpler times when kids knew about music and... 
[03:41:30]  Oh, my God.  Right.  That was the best time.  Remember how good things were, Gail?  Before they could vote.  Oh, God.  All right.  I need this.  Right.  I need that site.  Hey, Gail.  Could you copy and paste that to my email immediately?  Hi, Gail.  Well, let's get Gail to sing a song.  Gail, what is your favorite song from the 60s?  Well, your favorite song to sing.  I know there's the one that you just requested that you want to go out because, you know,  it reminds you of your husband, Puddin' Head. 
[03:42:00]  But what song do you love from the 60s?  I love any of the Mama and Papas.  See, I knew it.  When you said 60s, I knew the Mamas and the Papas, or Mama and Papa, as you so dumbly  put it.  But, yes, the Mamas and the Papas.  Fantastic.  Could you sing something for us, Gail?  Please.  Hey, Joe.  Mama?  Is Johnny Angel in the 60s, or was that in the 50s?  Oh, you're pretty much talking the 50s, Johnny Angel. 
[03:42:30]  Just missed.  Johnny Angel.  That was more doo-wop kind of sound to it, wasn't it, Gail?  Yeah, that was a great song.  You like the doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop, doo-wop.  I do.  I love the doo-wop.  Bang-a-dang-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding-a-ding.  You like that?  Blue moon.  Wasn't it so much better when, you know, back before, you know, ah?  Yes.  Yes.  Here we go.  Yeah, Gail.  You like this music to you, Gail?  I do. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  You like separate water fountains?  Yeah.  A little take on Jimmy's joke.  I can't get enough of it.  How did you hurt your back, Gail?  Yeah, what happened to your back?  I was lifting concrete birdbaths.  What?  What?  A concrete birdbath?  Yeah.  Where do you find concrete birds?  See, concrete birdbaths.  Oh, it's a joke.  Hold on.  God, I wish you were on a bus with a hat and a cane. 
[03:43:30]  Dan, chessmeat.com.  Yeah, you can bring that down in the mix.  We just wanted a little piece of that.  Well, can we get Gail to sing a song?  Simpler times, Gail.  Simpler times.  How about, you want to sing a little Mamas and the Papas for us?  Sure.  All right, what song?  Monday, Monday.  La, da, da, da, da, da.  Can't.  Let me think I got those.  Here it comes.  Can't stop this day.  Well, can you hear the music playing, Gail?  Monday, Monday. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, my Jesus.  Here it comes, Monday, Monday.  Come on, come on.  Here it goes.  So good to me.  Come on, Gail, sing.  Come on.  I'll kill.  Monday morning.  You've only had 40 years to figure out the lyrics of the song, Gail.  Let's go.  I hoped it would be.  Come on, everybody.  Monday morning.  The doctor gave me no warning of what was growing in my head.  Monday.  Yeah, come on, Gail.  What a shock. 
[03:44:30]  A bird brain lifting a bird bat.  Oh, Jiminy Cricket.  Tumor, tumor.  Yes.  Oh, my goodness.  Monday.  Hatful of oatmeal.  Oh, God.  It's growing inside of me.  Sometimes it just turns out that way, right?  That's right.  You're crazy.  We're all crazy.  Crazy in love. 
[03:45:00]  But Monday, how could you leave?  That way.  And take my hair.  Well, you know, chemo's a bitch.  Every other.  They really have ruined this country, haven't they, Gail?  Oh, they certainly have.  Yeah.  Are you a fan of the black man?  Oh, Jesus.  Let's get into it, Gail.  All of the time.  Well, Sam, I'm listening to Cow Sills now. 
[03:45:30]  What?  The Cow Sills.  Yeah, that's good.  Yeah.  What song is that?  Hair?  Rain Park and Other Things.  What?  Which song?  Which song are the Cow Sills doing?  Rain, the park, and other things.  Brain?  No, oh, rain.  Rain.  Oops.  Freudian slip.  Rain, the park, and other things. 
[03:46:00]  Right.  How old a woman are you there, Gail?  57.  What?  57.  57?  57 years young.  Yes.  Oh.  57?  You sound a little old.  Do you smoke, Gail?  No.  Did you used to smoke?  No.  I bet you did.  I've tried it.  Yeah?  You ever tried the marijuana?  Did an inhale?  What about some of the Marahoochee?  You smoked that in the 60s? 
[03:46:30]  Right?  Did you go to Woodstock?  Yeah, I bet you.  God bless you.  God bless you, Gail.  Memories.  You an old pudding head.  Is she a big girl?  Oh, gee.  You a big girl there, Gail?  No.  No?  You're a slender, petite woman?  Yes.  Oh, that's fabulous.  Did you find yourself another man?  Any boyfriends?  No, I haven't.  Oh.  Why is that, Gail?  Because I haven't been looking. 
[03:47:00]  Why not?  I don't know.  You could find a guy that likes the same music you like, the 60s music.  That would be nice.  Yeah, one whose brain hasn't been through a Cuisinart.  You know, something like that.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, good gravy.  Good gravy.  Pardon my French.  All right, Gail.  I guess we'll get a song on for you.  I appreciate it. 
[03:47:30]  Absolutely.  And what was the song you requested?  My head hurts and it ain't stopping.  Oh, I appreciate it.  Of course.  It's good that we can all laugh about it, isn't it?  That's right.  Yeah, I hear you.  What song do you want to hear, dear?  I want to hear Don't Let the Sun Catch You Crying.  Right.  Fucking Jay from Huntington writes, Gail hurt her back from the high pressure fire hose pushing her against the building.  Oh, what happened? 
[03:48:00]  What happened, Gail?  No, seriously.  Did Johnny Angel come out in the 60s or the 50s?  I believe that's the 60s.  1958.  1958.  1958.  62.  62.  Right.  That's what I thought.  No, no.  No, 1959.  No, no.  It was 60.  Now you're josting with me.  Oh!  Oh!  Get out!  On the phone.  Mother fuck. 
[03:48:30]  Wow.  You can play either one of those songs.  Yes.  I like the one of them.  A little hat removal.  Yeah.  All right, Gail, we're going to let you go.  Okay, I appreciate it.  We're busy.  We're talking to y'all.  Good luck with that.  Good luck with those three discs.  Yes, good luck with your operation.  When is that happening?  June the 8th.  Ah, June the 8th.  Hey, the 9th, tell your husband we said hi.  Okay.  I hope they fix your back like that cow at the end of Apocalypse Now. 
[03:49:00]  All right, Gail.  All right, Gail.  All right.  You keep going.  Stay away from those birdbaths.  All right.  All right.  You're crazy.  Yes, we are.  All right.  There goes Gail.  Oh, my God.  The cow went apostolic when he fixed his back.  He sure did.  Oh, it was horrible.  Can we go home now?

Always time for that later.  I got to get out of here.  Unrealboobs.com.  I tend to.  Unrealboobs.com.  That's going to be fucking animal monster tits.  You think?  Of course it is.  Where's our, where's Dan?  Those aren't even, Danny even had to leave. 
[03:50:00]  He was jerking off to Gail's phone call.  You sure he's not taking his once a week shit?  Jesus.  Yeah, apparently.  We found out Danny doesn't move his bowels very often.  He had a lot of meat products during the long weekend.  What does he eat?  A burger with fucking glue on it?  He said he used to shit like every, every other day or something.  But now it's like every third or fourth day.  Tell him to stop holding his shits in and just get his fucking system fixed already.  He's stocking up.  Gotta get a little roughage in there.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  What does he eat?  Just spackle and shoe leather? 
[03:50:30]  What a dick.  No one's going to type in.  Adobe and straw.  Could you type in unrealboobs.com?  No.  What the fuck?  That's horrible.  Why?  Because those tits are fucking awful to look at.  How do you know?  Unless you try.  Because I have already looked at eight different monster tit sites.  They're horrible.  Oh, they're bloody horrible.  Oh, is it?
