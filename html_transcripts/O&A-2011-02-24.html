<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts – Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton – engaging in their typical crude humor, focusing initially on Opie's struggle with dieting while simultaneously enjoying his sister's lava cakes.  E-Rock contributed to this discussion, revealing his aversion to chocolate.  The conversation then veered towards their experiences at the gym, featuring graphic and humorous observations about women's workout attire and Opie's admitted strategy for discreetly viewing women in the locker room.  They also discussed the prevalence of women who seem to prioritize socializing over actual workouts.  A Brian Regan bit about gym behavior was referenced.  Opie's renewed fandom of the New York Knicks, fueled by Carmelo Anthony's acquisition, led to a discussion of Anthony's debut and reminiscences about past Knicks players, including Patrick Ewing's controversial jump shot. This transitioned into an offensive discussion about the history of NBA shorts and perceived racial differences in their design, with commentary focusing on how shorter shorts might conceal genitalia.  The ongoing Libyan civil war and desperate tweets from Libyan civilians were discussed, seguing into commentary on the broader political situation and gas price increases.  The show promoted upcoming guests: Duff McKagan, Louis C.K., and a phone interview with Donald Rumsfeld.  A new Billy the Bass production piece was teased. The show concluded its opening segment by highlighting their newly renovated studio with prominent Opie & Anthony branding and the potential for conflict with fellow Sirius XM hosts Ron & Fez.

The next segment featured Louis C.K. in studio, promoting his Borgata show.  The conversation immediately shifted to Donald Rumsfeld, his new book, and speculation about his knowledge of classified information. They discussed the Middle East uprisings, focusing on Egypt and Libya, and the personalities of Gaddafi and Mubarak.  Graphic details of the assault on Lara Logan were discussed.  A lengthy discussion ensued about the decline of small businesses due to large corporations and online services, using numerous examples like bookstores and coffee shops.  The plight of a homeless Pakistani man sold into servitude as a child was mentioned, as was a caller's experience living near one of Gaddafi's sons. The segment concluded with further discussion of the loss of local culture due to corporate dominance and digital technology.

The following segment included both Louis C.K. and a phone interview with Donald Rumsfeld.  The conversation with Louis C.K. began with a critique of corporate America and the displacement of small businesses.  This expanded into a discussion of the declining quality and repairability of modern products, exemplified by cars and Starbucks coffee.  Louis C.K. advocated for supporting local businesses.  He expressed a bleak view of American identity and the potential for societal collapse.  The Rumsfeld interview followed, focusing on his career, his legacy during the Bush administration, and his views on the Middle East.  A significant portion involved Louis C.K.'s playful but pointed questioning about whether Rumsfeld was a lizard person, to which Rumsfeld offered evasive answers.  The 2012 elections, American education, unions, and Rumsfeld's views on the Second Amendment were also discussed. The interview concluded with more lizard jokes.  Post-interview, Opie and Anthony analyzed Rumsfeld's evasiveness.

A subsequent segment featured another phone call with Louis C.K., who was again repeatedly asked if he was a lizard, providing increasingly nonsensical answers.  The hosts speculated about the reasons for his evasiveness.  They then discussed Rumsfeld, expressing amusement and disbelief at having interviewed him and joking about the potential danger to Louis C.K.  Duff McKagan then joined in-studio.  The conversation moved to the Middle East uprisings, Duff's investment strategies, the economic downturn, music industry trends (including potential plagiarism in a Lady Antebellum song and Guns N' Roses' potential Super Bowl performance), and the changing landscape of music distribution.

The final segment began with praise for Carmelo Anthony's Knicks game performance.  The conversation shifted to the Seattle Sonics' relocation to Oklahoma City, blaming Howard Schultz and Clay Bennett.  This led to comparisons with the loss of the Cleveland Browns and the Tasty Diner.  Duff McKagan shared anecdotes about Seattle and his NBA views.  Sam Perkins' alleged marijuana use and the contrast between teams in smaller versus larger markets were discussed. The segment concluded with a farewell to McKagan, promotion of upcoming Louie C.K. shows, and a sexually graphic CB radio conversation between Jim Norton and Anthony Cumia.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny, and it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck, I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Uh, funny.  Ah, good morning.  Welcome to The Opie and Anthony.  Ah, good morning.  I was thinking about that.  Does that even make any sense anymore?  What's that?  To start every show with, ah, good morning.  Ah, good morning.  Are you just talking to people that know?  Yeah.  Or do they just hear, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. 
[00:01:30]  Words, words, words, words, words, words, words, words, sex bench.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Catherine Hepburn, get to that soon.  Yes.  Why aren't you taking a piece of my sister's lava cake?  Because I had that wonderful chocolate-dipped Oreo cookie yesterday.  Right.  And, oh, I just felt guilty about it the whole day.  It went right to your thighs?  Oh, right to my thighs.  My sister, I don't know, man. 
[00:02:00]  I'm running into her lately.  And a lot of these baked goods.  Tell her thank you very much, but you've got to keep that shit out of here because it's too delicious.  And she's going to take on Bobby, and she's going to take on Martha Stewart, my sister.  Yeah.  The Cake Boss is, that's easy.  I mean, shit.  That's easy.  Yeah.  Our baking reality show would be so much better than The Cake Boss.  That looks really good.  You ever watch that, Cake Boss?  I've seen it. 
[00:02:30]  I think I've, like, strolled onto it halfway through.  Probably jealous, actually, because I'm meeting myself.  Because you go to Hoboken on a lousy Tuesday afternoon, let's say.  Hoboken.  There's a line all the way down the street for dummies.  Sorry, but if you've been in that line, you're a dummy.  They're in line to go in to see the Cake Boss place.  And watch the...  So, pure jealousy on my part.  See, I didn't even know it was there.  I think I need a little reality show based around F.H. Riley's. 
[00:03:00]  And then we get the line.  Why don't you do that?  Yeah.  All the way down New York Avenue.  Just so they could see the place where the reality show was filmed.  I've heard, like, Pawn Stars, if you go to that place.  Same thing, right?  There's a line.  There's security people now.  Yeah.  And it's constantly packed.  That's Cake Boss.  Yeah.  And they wander in.  And, of course, you've got to buy something.  And they're like, oh, this is where Cake Boss is filmed.  Do they sell little Cake Boss tchotchkes?  I didn't go in.  Are there tchotchkes?  I walked by and said, why are these dummies online?  A teacup?  Can you buy a teacup with their name and logo on it? 
[00:03:30]  I'm sure.  I'm sure they have all those trinkets.  God.  But my sister's baked goods is just as good.  Just as good.  Today, it's homemade lava cakes.  Because I was out there in Huntington yesterday for my mom's 75th.  Ah.  The big 75 for my mom.  Wow.  Maybe she doesn't want everyone to know her age.  Too late.  You let that out of the bag.  You know, things better with me and her, I guess.  Oh, that's nice.  Things are better. 
[00:04:00]  Better?  And I went over there and said happy birthday.  Then went to FH Riley's with my sister's kid.  And then my sister goes, I'm making homemade lava cakes for you guys when you get back here.  Delish.  Yeah, but I don't want to eat this stuff.  I know.  You can't.  I want to eat this stuff.  Who doesn't?  But I don't want to eat this stuff.  There's temptation everywhere.  And then she made some kind of homemade vanilla something whipped cream.  I'm like, you made this from scratch?  What are you doing?  They sell that.  She said, I whipped it up.  They sell that in stores. 
[00:04:30]  I know.  Like everything.  I love that.  I made it from scratch.  It's like, really?  Yeah.  They make a thing.  It's called Cool Whip or something.  Yeah, exactly.  You take a dollop out.  Give me a dollop.  No, this shit was fucking good, man.  So I brought in the leftovers.  Because then she sends me home with lava cakes.  I'm like, I don't want lava cakes laying around all willy-nilly.  It's temptation.  So I brought them in here to see who's weak.  I remember being able to just eat anything.  Cake and ice cream. 
[00:05:00]  When you're a fucking kid, you just shove that shit in your face and it's gone.  You can eat it now.  Yeah, I know.  But you think about it.  Yeah, but then you don't go run around outside for three straight hours burning off.  Yeah, yeah.  Ride your bike fucking 15 miles in one afternoon.  It just fucking sits heavy in you.  I'll just slouch on my couch with the remote in my hand.  That was tasty.  I don't care.  I could eat this stuff, but it just sits heavy.  Yeah.  That's what bothers me.  It just feels like... 
[00:05:30]  I feel like I've negated a workout if I eat shitty.  That's about right.  Like what I did yesterday is not.  I've just completely taken it out of the mix.  You call it a wash.  I don't like that at all because it's too hard to work.  That's why they don't call it a play out.  Right.  It's a workout.  You don't want to do it and it's hard to do.  Yeah, correct.  So you don't want to fuck it up by just munching out. 
[00:06:00]  And then how fast do you actually eat that?  It's gone in probably a minute and a half.  Seconds.  You think seconds?  That lava cake seconds.  Honestly, I was thinking like maybe a minute and a half of chewing.  I went to my sister's house, like I said, and she had them all warm and ready with the  whipped cream.  It took 30 seconds.  Yeah.  I'm not even joking.  And that takes care of an hour and a half of fucking crunches and cardio and fucking lifting  and dips and curls. 
[00:06:30]  It's not fair.  Yeah.  See, look, I got crappy oatmeal here.  Look, crappy fucking oatmeal and look what's over there.  Nice lava cake.  And you know, you throw that in the microwave for 15, 20 seconds, it's going to be just  heaven.  And the smell would permeate the room.  Oh, yeah.  Chocolate.  Oh, fucking.  Cakey.  Yeah.  So I don't know.  Give it to E-Rock.  E-Rock will eat it.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock eats anything.  E-Rock does not eat chocolate.  What?  Never?  What's wrong with you?  Nah, I'm not a chocolate fan.  You're a racist. 
[00:07:00]  I don't get to people that aren't chocolate people.  Jesus.  Why don't people like chocolate?  What's wrong with you?  It's delicious.  Chocolate is the greatest thing ever invented.  It really is.  I was in Godiva yesterday and they had the fucking.  Godiva.  The almonds with the dark chocolate.  Almonds.  The almonds.  And then the stupid lady's trying to sign me up for a, what is it?  Chocolate of the month?  Something like that.  We send you a piece every week of chocolate in the mail.  I'm like, no.  Mail. 
[00:07:30]  She goes, what's wrong with you?  I'm like, what's wrong with you?  Come on, get it.  Now where are you?  And then I go, you don't look like you're eating a piece of chocolate every week.  What does that mean?  Well, it means you're not a fat pig is what it means.  Oh, you're being a little sassy with her?  I didn't say fat pig though.  But it was close to saying that.  I'm like, no, I don't want to be on your mailing list with a piece of chocolate in the  mail every week.  But that does sound like it.  It would be a good thing.  Chocolate.  What is it though?  A little piece or you get like a big fucking bag?  Yeah, because Godiva is like messing around with their flavors, man.  It's like a key lime, dark chocolate type of thing. 
[00:08:00]  Wow.  But the key lime in the middle now.  A couple of Marys we are chatting about delicious chocolate and how it, ooh, we've got to work  this off.  No, but it just.  I've got to go to, I've got to go to Curves and work this off.  Is Curves the women's gym?  I'm going to Curves to work this off.  Yeah, that's the women's gym, right?  That's the women's gym.  Because women have decided they need their own gym because of us perverts.  Yeah, we have to go to Cox.  Right. 
[00:08:30]  Curves.  They had to invent a gym for themselves because perverts would make sure they grab the machine  right where the girl is doing her bend over.  That's not even, that's not even, I've been going to the gym, by the way.  Yes.  In case you haven't noticed.  Dan's lost some weight.  I see this girl all the time at the gym.  And the gym that I go to, the girls are pretty good.  Like it's a reason to actually go.  Because if you go, you go, well, I'll be, I'll be motivated because there's always hot  chicks on her.  Hotness.  Yeah.  So there's one chick, and I know she's caught me staring like a thousand times. 
[00:09:00]  What's she wear?  Uh, just like the tights, you know, like those tight, the tights material.  Some like white, wife beatery type of thing.  But she's my type of chick.  Like she's got tats everywhere.  You know, she's got that gothy emo thing on.  It's like, I'm doing this, I was doing this thing where it was just like, I would pretend  that, that she caught me, but I was really just staring at her so that we can make  the eye contact.  So now you're just blatant, you're being blatant.  So, nothing ever really came from that.  So I was just like, whatever.  But obviously I'm still going to the gym.  She's still going to the gym.  So I go to the gym the other day, I get on the treadmill. 
[00:09:30]  This fucking bitch takes the machine right in front of me.  Like, like, almost like she was like, like, ah, you like that?  You know?  And then she, and got on the machine for like a half an hour.  She fucking knew exactly what she was doing.  So fuck that perfect shit at the gym.  They know exactly what they're doing.  And they fucking like it.  She fucking passed you.  Like it.  Getting to the point, though.  I mean, they had to invent their own gym to keep those pervy guys out.  To keep the fucking.  I said this on the air.  My old gym.  That's the fat chicks, though. 
[00:10:00]  What?  That do that.  Because the hot chicks want to show off their hotness.  You think?  Yes.  At the gym.  Let me think about that.  They're busting their balls to show off their hotness.  The fat chicks are just like, I'm going to try to lose the weight I have from shoving  cake in my face all week.  So they go to the fat lady gym, which is curves.  And, you know, then guys don't have to watch them and go, ugh, look at her fat jiggle.  Do you have women at your gym that have the pocketbook that they drag from machine to machine? 
[00:10:30]  What?  Yeah, no, no.  Oh, my God.  What is that about?  It's infuriating.  I'm like, I'm obviously not in the right gym if they allow these Bettys in here.  What are they doing with the pocketbook?  Leave it in your locker.  They have their clipboard, and they have their pocketbook, and then they go from machine to  machine, and they put their pocketbook down.  Is that new people?  And then they do five reps with 15 pounds, and then they check it off on their clipboard.  I'm all done here.  And I see them week after week after week, and I want to shake them and go, it's not. 
[00:11:00]  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  First of all, leave your stupid pocketbook in the locker room.  Let's start there.  Let's get ready to work out, people.  I like the fat girls that they get on the treadmill, and they walk at like three miles an hour for seven minutes,  and then they get off, and it's like, what are you doing?  You're not doing anything.  Just long enough to get dizzy.  I think I've got to change gyms, because then the trainers, and I bet you this is some equal  opportunity bullshit, the trainers are getting older and a bit out of shape. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, really?  A little flappy?  So then I'm thinking, if I'm going to have a trainer, I don't want a guy that's graying  and has a potbelly.  Yeah.  Because then you're looking at them like, why are you telling me how to do this?  Why don't you do it yourself?  What, you learn how to do it properly, but you don't do it yourself?  That doesn't make sense.  You want some...  Do as I say, not as I do.  Give me a Twinkie.  You want some animal that's ripped, because then you're thinking, okay, this guy or this  girl knows what they're talking about, because some of the girls are ripped too now, which  is kind of scary.  But the pot...  Show me something, and he'll have massive weight on, and be like, okay, and just do this. 
[00:12:00]  And then he goes, pulls the pin, clang, I'm one plate guy.  Thanks, Thunder.  Regan bit is great.  Can we play the Brian Regan gym bit into break today?  Clang, clang.  I'm one plate guy with the clipboard.  So I guess you could take a training class to train other people, but you don't necessarily 
[00:12:30]  have to be like a workout person.  Nah, I don't like that.  Nah, it bothers me, man.  And then the trainers spent half the time in my gym just chit-chatting with their clients.  What the hell is that about?  I don't know, man.  When I was sort of living in LA for a little while, I had a trainer out there, and the  guy was all business.  Yeah.  And then maybe we talked for five minutes after the workout, like, you know, about whatever  that's going on.  But when we were in the gym, it was like, all right, we don't have time to talk. 
[00:13:00]  Business.  It was all business.  But they're like talking about recent trips, and you know, I watch and study all this shit  all day long, so.  I have a TV.  Chit-chatting.  I have a TV in my gym, and I just fixate on that, which kind of makes the time go by.  It's a little easier to work out and kind of glance up and watch the news or something  like that.  Right, right.  But yeah, chit-chatting.  Yeah, in between.  Like, if I'm shaking off, you know, I'm shaking off a set, you know, shaking off my legs or something,  then I'll have a little chit-chat that goes on. 
[00:13:30]  No, this is as the reps are going on.  No, you can't talk during that shit.  That's absolutely what I'm talking about.  And you shouldn't, you actually shouldn't be able to carry on a fucking conversation.  You should be grunting like an animal during that shit.  You should be miserable for that five seconds of reps.  Exactly.  My old gym, I don't live in that area anymore.  I haven't talked about this in a while, and I don't want to blow it for the other guys  that have figured this out, but it's too good for the radio.  In between sets, I would go to the, I told you, the bulletin board. 
[00:14:00]  There's a dumb bulletin board, like yoga classes today, or blah, blah, blah.  Oh, and, hey, if you've seen this missing cat, and, hey, blah, blah.  Tear off the little tab with the phone number on it.  They had this weird, like, bulletin board in between the two locker rooms.  And I went over there one day just to check it out, and then I looked to my left a little,  and I go, no, no, no.  I looked to my left.  You could see the mirror in the fucking ladies' locker room, swear to God, and then it bounces 
[00:14:30]  into the reflection.  And also, I'm looking at girls in bras.  I'm like, this cannot be happening.  Wow.  So then every fucking set I did, I walked over the bulletin board like it was the most interesting  thing ever to see if there was anything going on.  Oh, that.  And then I'm feeling like a pervert.  And then I'm thinking, who else knows about this?  Because there wasn't a line there.  How many car services do you need?  But I would, like, kind of whistle and, like, make believe, like, just stretch and, like, 
[00:15:00]  kind of wander over to the bulletin board.  I don't think many people, honestly, I don't think anyone else knew about it when I was still  at that gym because I didn't see anyone else, you know, going over there doing what I was  doing.  You would think the women would notice if they, you know, if they could see the person, the  person could see them.  I would love to go back in that gym just to see if it's still happening.  If you can't see my mirrors, you're in my blind spot.  All of a sudden, girls just, in bras, I didn't officially see any, uh, ta-tas.  That's hotness, though. 
[00:15:30]  But it was pretty good.  A little sneak peek.  Yeah.  We all love the sneak peek.  Oh, my God.  Nothing better.  Yeah.  The little fucking, ooh, inadvertently, ooh, look.  Right.  Ooh, she doesn't know I'm peeking at her.  Lady and Jim works out in Uggs.  Tony and Brooklyn.  Jesus.  Uggs.  What are you doing?  What's the, uh, what's the consensus on the Ugg?  Do we like the Ugg?  Yeah, the Uggs are all right.  Danny gives the thumbs down on the Ugg.  They're just all right.  I'm, uh, I'm up in the air on the Ugg.  Yeah?  I'm not sure.  Some girls can wear the Ugg and pull the Ugg off. 
[00:16:00]  Others, not so much.  I'll tell you, I think it depends on what else is going on with the Uggs.  Oh, what other part of the Achutra Mall?  Like, jeans, eh, whatever.  But girls all over Long Island are doing the Uggs with the, uh, with the, like, the tights.  I don't know what you call it.  Is it just tights, or what is it?  What do they call them now?  I don't know what it is.  There's no words for them.  It's basically leaving the house in a t-shirt Uggs and pantyhose, and I love it.  Yeah.  So keep doing that, folks.  That's a good look.  That works.  Don't mind the Uggs.  But it is the official fucking women's shoe of Long Island, is the Ugg. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  I mean, there are a lot of Uggs on Long Island.  Yeah.  And Uggs.  And Uggs, yeah.  Ugg faces and Uggs on their feet.  Right.  That's why it's the official shoe.  The Ugg.  Ugg.  The Uggs are wearing Uggs.  Uh, yeah.  A stretchy, uh, yeah, they call those, what are the jeans?  Leggings.  There's leggings, but there's also this thing that's jeans that are leggings.  Oh, pajama jeans. 
[00:17:00]  I've seen those.  We've seen pajama jeans.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're just, uh...  Jeggings.  What?  Jeggings.  Is that something official?  Jean leggings are jeggings.  I never heard this term before.  Dude, look.  Look at that.  See?  Yeah, I see it.  They're called jeggings.  There's the jeggings right there.  And they're leggings, but they look like jeans or something.  Some of these jeggings make girls' asses look a little too flat.  Yeah, that girl has an awful ass, by the way.  They're pushing down too much stuff.  Find a good ass in jeggings and see it, because that's a mom ass. 
[00:17:30]  Ugh.  Well, there's...  There you go.  Oh, hey.  Look at that.  That's a golden jeggings.  Yeah, jeggings is jean leggings.  I didn't know that.  Yeah!  A little out of touch, I guess.  They put the Uggs on and walk around with that.  You can see camel toe.  They're wearing jeans, but you can see camel toe through jeans.  People are saying we would love chocolate in the mail.  I'm not getting chocolate in the mail.  No.  Get the fuck out of here.  That message board is in every gym... 
[00:18:00]  Hold on a minute.  Let me go to Nate in Philly.  You can see inside your women's locker room, too?  Nate?  Opie, I haven't been in a gym where there wasn't a message board  conveniently located next to the women's locker room.  It's the straight man's version of the gym teacher's glass wall.  Wow, I thought I really was on to something.  Maybe the people buying these, building these gyms are on to something.  So I think I kept my membership there a little longer than I probably would have. 
[00:18:30]  You really were?  You knew every little fucking detail about a missing tabby?  Yeah.  If you saw that cat walking around, you'd absolutely know.  Yeah.  Is that Conan wearing jeggings?  He went with the jeggings?  Look at his fucking cock bolt.  He also tucked his dress shirt into the top of the jeggings.  That's pretty funny.  Well, embarrassed to say, but it has to be said,  I'm officially a hardcore Knicks fan again. 
[00:19:00]  Is that it?  Hardcore Knicks fan again.  Well, I guess...  You know what?  Call me the fair weather...  Call me all that shit, but...  Fair weather fan!  What am I going to do?  The Knicks have sucked for so long that I really did tap out to the point, I didn't even know  the players anymore.  Yeah.  This year I started...  The last two years started kind of taking a peek.  Then the Knicks get Carmelo Anthony and Chauncey Billups, by the way.  Yeah.  Who's an amazing player, but they're downplaying that because it's all about Carmelo Anthony. 
[00:19:30]  Mello!  Right.  Mello!  They were chanting.  Oh, yeah, man.  And his debut, he had, what, 27 points last night, beat the Bucs 108-104, something like  that.  You know, he's the third highest scoring Knick for a debut player.  Very good.  Who's number one and who's number two?  Oh, that's actually, I believe, Patrick Ewing.  Uh-huh.  No, I have no idea.  Oh, I don't know either.  I don't know.  I was just going to go with your answer.  I just heard on the news, I heard a factoid, but I blurted it out.  That's a good factoid.  So I sound informed.  Yeah, the last time you were a fan was when I think you were bitching that Patrick Ewing 
[00:20:00]  was doing his fadeaway jump shots.  Oh, you remember that?  Yeah.  And that was it.  After that, you were all out.  It was driving me nuts.  You remember that bit?  Oh, yeah.  Fucking, we got a seven-foot, eight-inch center, and he's taking fadeaway jump shots from 12  feet out.  What are you doing?  That was the last we heard you even talk about the Knicks.  That was kind of near the end of Ewing's career.  He started doing that fadeaway jump shot shit.  And now you're all back in.  All back in.  And I was trying to remember the last time I was an actual fan of the Knicks, where I 
[00:20:30]  want to search out, you know, going to games and all that.  And I can't remember.  I think it was around that time.  We've been back on radio for six years.  I definitely have not been a Knicks fan.  No, not at all.  The two years we were off, I was wandering the fucking earth.  It was an EW phase.  That's eight years.  So it's at least nine years that I wasn't a fan.  Yeah.  I couldn't even tell you.  I think it was...  How long has Ewing been retired?  It was weird.  See, there's the fadeaway.  Thanks, Dan.  He made that one, though. 
[00:21:00]  The fadeaway.  There it is.  What are you doing?  We have plenty of guys that could shoot from the outside.  That's great.  You need to get down low.  There it is.  Look at that fadeaway jump shot.  That was the...  That's when I knew the Knicks were in deep shit.  Yeah, you're putting the finger up...  Patrick Ewing!  Patrick Ewing had a habit of putting that one finger in the air.  Guess what?  I didn't see no championship.  He'd be like, yeah, there's one point.  I didn't see no championship.  No.  Fuck.  But at least Carmelo Anthony has just made us completely competitive now. 
[00:21:30]  People were very excited.  Although this year's team was not bad to begin with.  But now, wow, we got a team.  We got a team in front of us.  They're very excited.  That's what I'm hearing when they were talking about on the news.  Very excited.  And I'm like, why aren't they talking about Chauncey Billups a little more?  This guy's a fucking player, man.  It's like Patrice said.  He's a bit older, but he's still got a couple years left, man.  A couple real good years left.  Maybe Chauncey is the slouch, the good slouch.  What was Patrice called? 
[00:22:00]  The bum.  The confident bum.  We still need some height.  We still need some kind of a center presence.  But, you know what?  We're all right.  Ewing retired in 2002?  Yeah, that makes sense.  So I haven't watched the Knicks on a regular basis in nine years.  Wow.  That's the truth.  That is the God's honest truth.  Jesus.  Ewing's final season as a Knick for Patrick Ewing was the 99-2000 season.  Oh, a Knick. 
[00:22:30]  That was the last time he was a Knick.  Oh, you're right.  Then he went over the Supersonics.  I forgot about the Supersonics years.  You're right.  All right.  Yeah, but I was still watching a little past 2000.  Okay.  Yeah, so it's been about 10 years.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's craziness.  That's been 10 years.  I remember.  And now all in.  One trade, all in.  I heard because...  I'm the definition of a, you know...  The Fairweather fan.  Fairweather fan.  I was listening to you just talking now and noticed that you were saying, we need some hype. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, we do need...  We need a center.  We.  It's like, all of a sudden, you're back in...  All of a sudden.  I heard that yesterday.  Oh, really?  We need.  We need.  I'm talking for a lot of New Yorkers, though.  There's excitement now.  Well, it is.  People are really excited.  Something could avoid the drug dealer that wants to kill him.  Oh, what?  Somebody sent me a video.  I guess there's some fucking drug dealer that has some old gripe and basically hinted...  Christ.  ...hinted a while ago, you know, you better never show your face back in the hood or back 
[00:23:30]  in New York or something.  I don't even know how real this video is.  I have no fucking idea.  Someone tweeted that to me.  Yeah.  But these guys look like they meant fucking business, man.  Damn.  They, uh...  I guess they ran out of jerseys.  What's his...  Number seven?  Seven, yeah.  Yeah, they ran out of jerseys.  Everyone grabbed seven yesterday.  Yep.  So.  Yeah.  And, uh, what number was he?  And I think that number was retired from the Knicks.  It's up in the rafters, so you couldn't actually, uh... 
[00:24:00]  You listened to someone's source report.  Earl the Pearl.  Earl the Pearl, number 15.  Wow, very good.  I didn't know that.  He wasn't allowed to use that.  I loved Earl the Pearl.  Earl the Pearl Monroe.  He fucking was really tough.  Monroe!  Monroe!  Extremely tough to defend.  Which way is he going?  Oh, my God, yes.  Where is he going?  Spinning.  Where are we going?  He would do some spin shit.  Earl the Pearl, he'd take a shot.  Where are we going?  Where are we going?  Earl the Pearl was the man.  That's back in the day when they wore the funny shorts. 
[00:24:30]  Was that the funny shorts or the big, long shorts?  They really hated the black man in the early days of the NBA because everyone knows the  black man has the big hog.  The big dick, yeah.  But they made them, if you made it to the NBA, you got to wear the tiny little shorts.  The tidy whiteys almost.  They were the tidy whitey size.  And that was fine when it was just white, tall white guys playing basketball.  When Bob Cousy was playing.  Back in the 50s.  Then they allowed the blacks in the NBA, but they made them wear the tight whitey shorts. 
[00:25:00]  Very embarrassing.  I'm amazed their cockheads weren't popping out every time they went for a jump shot.  Or a rebound.  Just fucking jumping up and sticking their big dick in the white guy's face as they're  towering over their heads.  It's all good when Bob Cousy was doing his two-handed fucking push shot.  A layup.  Or the underhand free throw.  But man, when the blacks came along.  With their big dicks.  Could you show me some Google images of some blacks in the tiny little NBA shorts?  Tiny, tidy whitey NBA shorts. 
[00:25:30]  Then they came out with the long jams that were down to their ankles.  Yeah, because then the blacks finally got some power in the NBA and said, look, we got  to cover up our dicks.  We need longer shorts, assholes.  We got big penises.  I'm telling you.  Look.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  That's Artis Gilmore.  Yeah.  From the Colonels.  The Kentucky Colonels, by the way.  The Kentucky Colonels.  Yeah, this is ABA shit.  But look.  Look at Artis Gilmore.  He's got his arms folded and he's scowling.  He does not like that.  And that's because he's embarrassed that his cock might fall out of the tiny shorts. 
[00:26:00]  Look, the white guy's got both hands on his hips and his legs are a little spread apart.  Dude, that white guy was a great player.  Really?  I haven't seen his face in years.  What's his name?  Dan Issel.  Thank you.  Holy shit.  Dan Issel.  Yeah, he was an amazing player.  And the black guy, like he's almost got his legs.  It's Artis Gilmore.  He's a legend.  Like his legs are kind of like, ah, don't look at it.  But you can see the bulge.  He's pushing his left leg forward to hopefully hide his cock.  Yeah, to try to hide his big dick.  His body language, his arms are crossed in front of him, so he's kind of self-conscious. 
[00:26:30]  He's mortified.  Like, how are these tiny shorts going to hold my big black hog?  Someday us black people will persevere and get longer shorts.  Right, right, right.  I had that card.  That's Phil Jackson.  That Knicks card.  Sorry, I'm just looking at the Google.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I see that.  That's Phil Jackson, obviously, when he was playing for the Knicks.  I actually have that basketball card.  Crazy white guy.  You can't find any more blacks in the tiny little shorts?  Oh, those are fantastic.  And then you look at, like, yeah, JoJo White. 
[00:27:00]  Look.  He's leaning all the way to the left as he dribbles to kind of keep his cock in his pants  as he goes toward the hoop.  Running down court with his fucking big dick and his tight shorts.  Am I on to something?  Totally.  This is disturbing.  It's so...  Do you think they finally just said, look, we can't have these monsters running around  with their dicks?  You see the picture of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar?  He's got a rebound over his head, so his arms are up. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, no.  I mean, you're...  You're just less than...  He's fouling you with his dick.  Right.  Walt Frazier.  Personal foul, yes.  That's why Earl Monroe was doing those spin moves, because he just didn't want to be stationary  long enough so he could see his cock heads sticking out.  Yeah, this guy.  Yeah, this guy.  When that guy played, you know, the shorts were fine.  Yeah, he's the white guy from, like, the 50s.  He's holding the basketball in front of him with two hands. 
[00:28:00]  That was, like, the pose for white guy basketball.  White guy basketball.  Yes.  Boy, the black really changed the face of basketball, literally and figuratively speaking.  It just really became a sport that just white people really had to be good.  Look at poor Wilt Chamberlain in this shot.  He's actually leaning down.  Yeah.  To give his cock some more room in those tight little shorts.  Look at him.  To give his stilt.  Right.  To make his stilt.  Wilt's stilt. 
[00:28:30]  And that's what's-his-name who won 11 champions for the Celtics there.  Damn, man.  Yeah.  That's some old-school fucking shame.  And now, if you look at Magic Johnson had half the tiny little shorts.  You know Larry Bird was packing nothing.  Look at Larry Bird's fucking Irish white ass is just fucking flat in his little shorts.  Yeah.  Magic's just thinking about AIDS and his little shorts.  You know he had plenty of room for his little penis. 
[00:29:00]  I would assume Larry had a little one.  I had to.  Yeah.  Larry was a little Irish dick.  But there you go.  And then now today, I mean, the shorts are almost down to the knee.  Yeah.  They're big and fucking baggy.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  There he is.  Mellow.  Did I spell his name wrong last night?  Is it?  What?  Carmelo?  Yeah.  Look at the fucking-  Yeah.  They're down to the knees.  The shorts are down to the knees. 
[00:29:30]  See, now they can play properly.  Has there been such a change in uniform over the years?  I mean, I know football, if you go way back, they had that wacky leather helmet.  Right.  That wacky leather hat they would strap to their head.  They just had tiny little shorts.  I never understood that.  And then they had to pull their socks up, well, really high.  Yeah.  In the old days.  But look, now LeBron James could bend down for the loose ball without worrying about his cock falling out.  His dick or his balls popping out the fucking side.  I'm telling you, man. 
[00:30:00]  That's when the blacks got the power in the NBA.  They were able to change some things.  You think it was the blacks getting the power?  You think it was the whites going like, we can't have these blacks having their dicks hanging out.  We don't want to see your dicks anymore.  Get those longer shorts for these guys.  It's crazy.  Artis Gilmore is a mammoth man.  He could cross his arms over a golf cart.  Yeah.  All right.  Damn.  Hope you're going to be disappointed.  Knicks don't have a chance.  Oh, boy.  Look, man.  You know, there's excitement.  We got Kamala Anthony.  Well, you got to rain on the parade here. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, why not?  There's always going to be haters.  Yeah.  I mean, how could you hate today?  You know it was a good move for the Knicks, so how could you hate?  If you're into basketball in the Knicks.  And no one is expecting a championship this year.  Yeah, but it's a great rebuild time.  Yeah, it's exciting.  Yeah, moving forward.  Not 10 years of fucking nothingness.  There was energy in the garden last night.  Muhammad Ali had his cock fall out during a match.  What?  Yeah, the same thing was happening with boxing. 
[00:31:00]  They made him wear the tiny little fucking shorts.  Ron, is this true, or are you just fucking going,  with the bit?  Oh, no, it's true.  It's back in the late 60s, early 70s.  He might have even still been Cassius Clay.  But they had to have everybody come around in the ring,  hold towels, and he had his gloves on,  so somebody had to put it back in for him.  They had to put his dick back in?  See, I might be onto something.  Yikes.  They were like enough of the black man's dick popping out. 
[00:31:30]  We actually came here to see the sport.  All sports.  Yeah.  They needed to make their shorts longer when the black man started becoming the superior  athlete.  Right.  Right.  Danny, can you find out if that's true, if Muhammad Ali's dick popped out?  I've never heard that before in my life.  Me either.  You'd think it would be on the first page of results, but...  Yeah.  See, they had to go with the bigger shorts because your black athlete has the bigger penis.  Really, Jimmy the Greek?  See, your black athlete would breed back in the Civil War days with his giant penis. 
[00:32:00]  Really?  Is that what happened?  Shane of Westchester.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How you doing?  Good, Shane.  What's up?  Listen, I just need to say, you know, Opie, you brought up that bit again about looking  through the Bolton board and seeing naked girls.  Yesterday, you had that jerk-off from New Hampshire radio on, and you knew it wasn't...  What?  Go listen to something else.  No, it wasn't... 
[00:32:30]  I'm too old and tired to listen to your horseshit.  Scorch was great.  Yeah.  Actually, the feedback on Scorch was wonderful, and to defend myself, I haven't said the Jim  thing in probably three or four years.  We reiterate things.  If you've been listening that long, great.  If you haven't, great.  Right.  But no need to start bitching and complaining.  There's more people than just you.  If you're listening to something that you've heard before, other people haven't.  So shut it.  And my dumb Bolton board thing was only a minute out of a Jim bit that was pretty fucking 
[00:33:00]  fresh and new.  It was reiterating.  And then we went with the black cocks falling out of fucking...  Black cock.  Shorts.  Yes.  Say...  How often do we fucking really delve deeply into the black cock?  Shane, you don't have a voice on this show.  Sorry, brother.  You might have listened a little too long, and you got to move on to something else.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what to tell you.  Take a hike, listen to some other shit, and then if you want to come back sometime, fine. 
[00:33:30]  If you don't, fine.  Whatever.  Yeah, whatever.  If you could get 20 good minutes out of this radio show every day...  Oh, my God.  ...then we've done our jobs.  That's it.  If you're looking for four hours of brand new, holy shit material every day...  Go fuck your mother.  It's just not here.  It's not...  You're not going to get that with any radio show.  No, you got to kind of just...  So if you're like, ah, fuck, I heard that before, then move on for a little while and  come back and maybe you find something else you like.  I don't know.  I don't know what to tell you at this point.  Jeez. 
[00:34:00]  Fuck the haters.  Well...  Jeez Louise.  I don't know what to do with the haters.  They just...  Yeah, they just...  I think their job is to...  Hate it, got to hate.  I think their job is to try to destroy this whole thing for everybody.  I really do.  I think that's their job in the end.  Ah, fuck them.  Or what they're attempting to do.  Even though most people still enjoy this fucking radio show.  And that is a fact.  Or we wouldn't be here.  We're like Gaddafi.  We're not leaving.  No.  I don't care if you're protesting.  I was out of touch yesterday because of the mom's birthday thing and the chocolate of 
[00:34:30]  the week thing.  Ah, yes.  And all that crap.  So what's going on with Gaddafi?  With Muma.  Is it Gaddafi?  Gaddafi?  Isn't that odd?  I've said Gaddafi my entire life.  I've always said it with the K.  But I've seen it with the Q too, right?  And the Q and the G.  It's because we're just trying to spell a sound.  Like there's...  He doesn't spell it with a letter G, K, or Q.  Right.  They spell it with them squiggly lines.  Right.  And then you hear it said and someone heard like Gaddafi. 
[00:35:00]  And you're like, oh, how do you spell that?  Andy Levy had a great tweet about that.  He basically said that Gaddafi spells his name so many different ways that he ruined  his chances of trending on Twitter or something like that.  That's great.  Andy Levy's a good one to follow.  He is.  One of the best.  He's a really good one to follow.  He goes, is it with a Q, a K, a G?  He's not going to trend.  How's this guy going to trend on Twitter?  He's splitting everything up.  You split up the masses. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, Gaddafi, he's remaining defiant and killing a lot of his own people who are now  starting to go like, eh, this guy's a little crazy.  Even the military is starting to defect.  He's got some high-level, high-ranking government officials defecting and coming out and saying  that he was directly responsible for the bombing of the Pan Am flight over Lockerbie.  Jesus. 
[00:36:00]  So, yeah.  You know, I did hear that, and that means we had to have known, right, America?  Yeah.  So why didn't we really?  They all know.  I think we're just trying to keep.  I think Ronnie did do something.  I think he bombed the shit out of him.  Well, that's true, because he thought, but now we know through this guy, right?  Yeah, now it's like, oh, okay, I get it.  Yeah, you definitely did it.  Wow, so this guy's just ratting him out for all the horrific things he's done over the years.  A lot of people, yeah.  That we've wondered about, right? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And then a couple of these fighter pilots that were directed to bomb the protesters with fucking  fighters.  Yeah.  A couple of them punched out of their planes, just parachuted out, let the planes crash,  said fuck it.  A couple other ones defected to Malta and landed the planes there.  They just don't want to bomb their own people, which is kind of noble.  But this Gaddafi isn't going.  He's no Mubarak.  A lot of these guys are not Mubarak. 
[00:37:00]  No.  They are just fucking staying till the end.  No one's telling them to leave.  They're blaming America.  They're blaming Israel, whatever.  And they're not leaving.  So how does this end?  How does this one end?  Why does he have enough people still to kind of...  Iron Fist kind of a guy.  Yeah, but it seems like a lot of defections are going on.  Yeah, but he's still got enough people, especially the military.  He's still got the military.  Right.  He's able to just rack some fucking head.  Fuck. 
[00:37:30]  And you're not really seeing a lot of the news out of there because it's just some camera  phone shit.  And that shit's been getting out, and that's pretty graphic.  He's slaughtering people.  Right.  Hundreds so far, if not thousands.  You go on Twitter and you get a tweet, if you go to the trending topics in Gaddafi.  Yeah, yeah.  Then you get a creepy tweet like, help me.  Oh, I know.  It's weird.  Is this real?  Someone just got out on their phone and it's like, I'm being bombed.  Right.  They found a place where there's one bar and they're basically sending out an SOS tweet. 
[00:38:00]  It's so creepy.  Have you read some of those?  Yeah, it is eerie.  I wish I had one right in front of me to actually read, but every once in a while, it's  like, we need help in this town.  They're slaughtering.  Yeah.  And I'm like, what?  Is this real?  What happened?  Right.  Yeah.  And they're getting a couple of tweets out.  Creepy.  And it is creepy because these are people on the verge of being blown up, shot, stabbed.  Right.  Fucking whatever.  It's creepy.  And they're hoping that someone reads their tweet. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  But they only have seven followers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You really need followers during the revolution.  Right.  You really want to have like a few followers.  Because I just happened to read this one, but it's in the trending topic area where they're  just flying by like a slot machine.  So did someone besides me actually see the help SOS tweet?  Help SOS, please RT.  Right.  Please RT immediately.  Could you RT this because I really need help?  They're banging my door down now. 
[00:39:00]  And then no half the people are like, ah, he's just looking for followers.  Oh, he's got like fucking five followers.  Abdul is following him.  Right.  And the other four are all Mohammed.  Yeah.  But kind of creepy to see the SOSs coming out of there.  Yeah.  That's pretty much the only thing.  If I win, that'd be great.  They fly by though, man.  That's the only thing.  You got to camp out on that trending topic to kind of see it.  But so he's still hanging in there.  Yeah, he's he's there. 
[00:39:30]  Whoever it is, I don't even know the guy's name, but in charge of in Bahrain, he's still  there racking some head.  And Egypt is kind of getting a little rambunctious still because the military is still in charge.  They don't have a leader in there.  They don't know.  Yeah.  They got to wait for elections.  So they're getting a little edgy.  Yemen.  Same thing.  Gas prices are up over 100 bucks a barrel now because Libya is a huge supplier for Europe. 
[00:40:00]  Right.  And they're now assuming that the Europeans are going to start honing in on our shit from  Saudi and stuff.  And I heard that Libya has that sweet crude oil.  What's that?  Light, sweet crude.  What does that mean?  You learn so much shit when there's a revolution going on.  It could be.  I don't pay attention to these places usually.  Yeah.  It could be refined into like the very easily that we need.  Yeah.  It's a lot easier to refine.  Right.  What's the what's the price per fucking gallon here now? 
[00:40:30]  I don't know.  I filled up yesterday.  It's so expensive.  Why is diesel?  Didn't diesel used to be less than regular gas?  I believe so.  And now it's like more.  I believe so.  We got a thousand truckers that'll answer that.  But what are we going to pay this summer?  Five dollars a gallon?  Oh, my God.  Do you see it going up to five?  At least four.  I think we're going to crack well into four.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  And of course, it hits when we all decide we need to start driving around a lot more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's so weird how they figure that out.  So weird.  It's Mideast Violence Serious. 
[00:41:00]  Expect higher prices is on this gas station sign.  That could say anything.  Yeah.  People are like, it's going to be raining tomorrow.  Expect higher prices.  Yeah, they're going to.  I believe they like to take advantage of us, huh?  Oh, please.  Motherfuckers.  I have to raise prices.  Very bad violence in the Middle East.  I have to raise the price.  Yeah?  When do you lower it?  If everything clears up, you're going to lower it?  I don't think so.  Right. 
[00:41:30]  Prick.  You prick.  Old Man Dick writes, light, sweet, crude.  Yum.  It does sound tasty, right?  It does.  It always sounded like a good coffee from Duncan.  I always liked a lot of sugar and some heavy cream.  Light and sweet, just like my crude.  If I said, would you like some light, sweet, crude or one of my sister's lava cakes, you'd  have a tough decision on your hand.  I take it black, like my men.  Great scene that was.  All right.  Why don't we take our first break? 
[00:42:00]  Another busy show.  Yes.  We got Duff McKagan coming in.  Duff's coming in.  We like the Duff.  Louie of the CK.  Of the CK.  And on the phone, wow, Donald Rumsfeld.  Hey.  I've always been a fan of Rummy.  He's got a book out, Known and Unknown, a memoir, Donald Rumsfeld.  Look at that guy.  Look at the picture of him on the back, dude. 
[00:42:30]  What do you think he knows even at this point in his life?  Look at that picture.  He looks like one of them guys that just knows everything that happened in the world.  That's from 75 when the evacuation of Saigon.  Yeah.  There's a picture of him on the back.  Look at him playing tennis as a young guy with fucking Ford.  Is he wearing short shorts?  No, man.  How's this a hug?  This guy's wearing short shorts.  What's that guy about?  He's playing tennis with Ford.  What the fuck?  This guy was involved in everything that happened since the Vietnam War. 
[00:43:00]  When did he start?  I would say, yeah, Vietnam.  I mean, he's been the military guy forever.  Yeah.  Like, when did he start kind of doing the Navy and the government White House thing?  The Marine.  Is this him shaking hands with?  Intention of Marines assigned to.  Look at him shaking hands with Dwight Eisenhower, 1962.  Ike.  This guy's been in the shit for a long ass time.  That's just a young guy, man. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  There's a lot of cool pictures in this book.  Yeah, I'll never read this.  Oh, really?  Nah.  Peruse?  Nah.  Do you peruse a book?  I'll read some books.  Will you peruse a book without reading it?  No, I'll look at the pictures.  Yeah, you've got to look at the pictures and then read the under thing.  There he is with Reagan.  Yes.  Nixon.  Yes.  Donald Rumsfeld.  He's talking about Lebanon.  Hey, Will.  Reagan was deeply distressed over the loss of American lives, of course. 
[00:44:00]  In the end, the problems of Syria, Lebanon, and Israel proved as intractable for his administration  as for others.  It was not for lack of will on the president's part.  Yeah, this guy's been in the shit.  This looks like some tough reading.  And I just, I want to know about, you know, not just what he's been through, but how he  feels about his legacy.  Because he is really known as an evil guy. 
[00:44:30]  He's known for a lot of people as an evil, evil guy.  And I see him as being a patriot.  I don't see this guy as having no lack of love for country.  I mean, you know, he was in there during a rough time.  Right.  A lot of Cold War stuff.  And we'll see.  We'll talk to him.  I am a little petrified, though, with Louis C.K. being here and having Donald Rumsfeld on the phone.  Because Louis, not one to mince words. 
[00:45:00]  And not one that I would think would be a fan of Donald Rumsfeld.  Well, that's good, then.  Yeah?  Yes.  You've got to challenge him a little bit.  If he calls him a nasty word?  I don't have the knowledge to challenge him.  I don't think anyone does.  This guy's been in front of so many different press corps, there's no throwing him.  Right.  He used to stand there and be like, what?  What are you talking about?  Yeah.  He'd point at them and know everyone's names.  Bill?  What? 
[00:45:30]  Why were there no weapons of mass destruction?  I'm not going to get into the details of that.  And then you'd be like, why?  He knows how to deflect.  Oh, he deflects like fantastic.  What do you think?  A bunch of shock jocks like ourselves are going to get to the bottom of what he's all about?  I don't think we're going to get to the bottom of anything.  Actually, yeah.  It's going to be just a very normal interview.  We'll talk to you.  I don't need the government prying into my life because I pissed off Donald Rumpstead.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Fuck that shit.  Would Patrice call it the book of fucking dead people? 
[00:46:00]  It's like he's got a book of everyone that he's directly been responsible for being dead.  And it's giant.  And he doesn't want to be in it.  Yeah, fuck that.  We'll take our first break.  We got the Brian Regan gym bit.  Ah, love this one.  I got it over here, man.  What?  Oh.  What happened?  We both got it.  No, you could play that.  Yeah, but I was wondering if you wanted to do something else before that.  What?  Because you had mentioned a catchphrase that we had production for.  Oh, can we play the...  Oh.  You can save it.  I mean...  Yeah.  After the break, a brand new production piece. 
[00:46:30]  Billy the Bass, man.  Where are we going?  Oh, damn.  Because I figured we'd play it in show because we might want to fucking comment about it.  Nice.  Uh, D-Boy came up with this with the help of, uh...  It's D-Boy.  It's D-Boy.  It's not D-Boy.  It's a D-Boy production.  Everything's a D-Boy production.  D-Boy production.  I like to call it Lionsgate.  Lionsgate?  Yeah, he's like Lionsgate back there.  He can't even defend himself today.  No.  He's not here.  Also, you might want to listen to Ron and Fez later because they changed the studio. 
[00:47:00]  And I'm sure Ronnie's going to have some comments about it.  Oh, this is great.  We're here in Opie and Anthony Studios, broadcasting live from the Opie and Anthony Studios.  There used to be a couple banners that had our name on it.  And they could be torn down.  Torn down and then you put a Ron and Fez banner up or something.  Oh, right.  There was Velcro.  There was Velcro.  And then when Ron and Fez would have something going on, they would put their banners up.  Sure.  And now the entire wall is covered and there's no seams to rip down like panels. 
[00:47:30]  No, you can't rip none of this down.  The walls are all covered with giant Opie and Anthony, Sirius XM radio.  Logos.  Satellite.  With no room for Ron and Fez.  No.  And there's not nary a Ron and Fez to be found on the wall.  So I think we're going to hear Ronnie later on talk about how he's broadcasting from the Opie and Anthony facility.  We had nothing to do with this.  No.  Don't blame us, please.  Please.  All right.  Quick break.  First this.  I joined a health club and that's intimidating. 
[00:48:00]  They always have some big giant guys showing you around.  Hey, are you thinking of joining here?  Follow him.  I felt like a little monkey.  Where are we going, Thunder?  They gave me a clipboard for my first day.  Can you feel like more of a loser with a clipboard?  I'm new.  I'm supposed to check things as I see them.  I'm supposed to check things as I see them.  And I think the guy was making up muscle names just to play games with me. 
[00:48:30]  You know, this machine right here is for your flaktoid.  That's the toid I'm working on.  And then he leaves.  I don't remember anything he said.  All I know is I don't think I ever felt so alone in my life.  I'm in a health club with a clipboard.  Nobody's talking to me.  I had black socks on.  All I knew is I didn't want to follow these big guys that are able to move the entire rack of plates. 
[00:49:00]  You know, I don't want to go next and be moving only two plates.  Clank!  Clank!  Clank!  I'm the two-plate guy.  Clank!  Who wants to spot me?  Clank!  So I get away from these guys and I go over to this other area where there's nobody around.  And I got into this one thing, but I got into it wrong, apparently. 
[00:49:30]  I don't know where your arms and legs are supposed to go.  So I just get in there and I just start moving stuff.  This guy comes up.  Hey, buddy, would you mind getting out of the painter's scaffolding?  I'm checking the exits.  Call the Opie and Anthony Show now.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.

[00:50:00]  I love the macro.  Gotta love this.  Louis C.K. in studio.  Very nice.  Promoting the Borgata.  He doesn't have to promote that.  That thing's going to be sold out.  It's April 23rd.  For tickets, go to Borgata.com.  April 23rd.  Louis C.K.  Yes, sir.  We got Donald Rumsfeld calling in today.  I know.  I'm really excited about it.  Are you?  I'm really excited.  You a big Rummy fan?  Oh, God.  I'm just so excited that we're going to actually be speaking to this guy. 
[00:50:30]  It just feels like a very rare opportunity.  Oh, yes.  A rare opportunity is the only way to put it.  Well, he's got a new book there.  He's very inner circle.  This is the guy.  This is the guy.  This is the guy.  You look at some of the pictures in there.  You see him during the Cold War, during Vietnam.  This guy was in all of this stuff.  No, he knows actually what's going on.  Yes, exactly.  He actually knows.  He knows.  Can you imagine what he knows that he'll never tell anyone?  Oh, my God.  Because this book is a waste of time because he knows real stuff that he'll never write about. 
[00:51:00]  It's just his memoir.  No, he's the shit he's taking to his grave.  But on his deathbed, he should just release it and go, here you go.  This is what I really know.  We are aliens at Roswell.  Yes.  We did kill Kennedy.  There was an interview with Jimmy Carter.  I don't remember who did it, but somebody who asked him, is there, when you become president,  do they sit you down and tell you, here's what's really going on?  Here's the deal.  Aliens and all kinds of stuff. 
[00:51:30]  And then did you carry that to your grave?  And he said, yep.  He just said, yep.  He said, yep.  Blanket, yes.  Yep.  And they said, well, what are the things?  He said, I'm not ever going to tell anybody.  But yeah, they tell you some things that will really surprise you.  Wow.  And they also scare you to the point where you're not even going to release it on your deathbed  because you know that you'll probably take out your entire family or something.  Exactly.  So you've got to be a loner that knows all this stuff.  And this is one of those guys.  I mean, he's one of the guys who tells. 
[00:52:00]  He's not one of the people who gets told that.  No, no, no.  No.  I absolutely believe that.  He tells the people.  Yes, he is the teller of the story.  Teller of the crazy things.  Yeah.  Come on in here.  I've got something to tell you.  Oh, Rummy.  And then it's just hard stuff.  I never missed a single press conference of this guy.  No.  Weren't they fantastic?  Unmute the TV Rummy's on.  I loved the Rumsfeld press conferences were the best.  He could deflect questions like a superhero with fucking, with bracers on his arms. 
[00:52:30]  No, that really is, that is like, you're defending, like you're, you're, you're on the,  like the cutting edge of the world's everything and you're fixing your tie and just standing  there, fixing your tie and going, no, I hate you telling you that.  Oh, the balls.  Oh, move on.  Bah, bah, bah.  What's your question?  Knows the name of all the reporters.  So defiant.  Knows their family.  Knows where they live.  Knows their credit history.  Yeah.  Knows if they're going to be audited.  Right.  Knows how much they owe on their house. 
[00:53:00]  Rummy.  Is there any, uh, anything in particular you want to, uh, talk to him about or ask him?  I'm sure somebody from his camp is listening.  Yeah, man.  I don't even know why we're talking to this guy.  Why are we taking a chance like this?  A chance?  We're not going to get anything out of him.  I mean, it's just going to make our lives miserable.  Uh, no, I'm excited to talk to Mr.  Rums.  Yeah.  Yes.  Donald Rums.  You see the picture on the back?  He's still looking to go.  He'll, he, by the way, he ain't done.  No.  Next Republican president is going to bring him back. 
[00:53:30]  He'll be right on.  He'll be right back in.  He'll be right back in.  You see the picture on the back of the book?  Like, that, that, that is the look of a guy that was, during the Cold War, that just knew  everything.  How close, how close we really were to the world.  Yeah.  To the, to the bomb actually going.  Yep.  He was standing in the room while people's fingers were on buttons to launch missiles  going, well, here it is.  All right.  Stand down.  He knows what had to happen and not there be those wars. 
[00:54:00]  Right.  He's got to be pushed.  But then on the front, he says, yeah, but I just still put on a polar fleece and stand  on my porch.  That's all.  That's it.  The casual shot at the ranch.  I'm going to throw this polar fleece on.  Take a picture for the cover.  Yeah.  It's looking good.  With his sensible jeans.  Yeah.  Sarah Palin has a polar fleece on her cover, too.  Is that the look?  That's the new thing.  It's like, yeah, but I got a polar fleece on.  You look like what I ever do to anybody.  Right.  Look at me.  Can't hurt a fly.  Come on. 
[00:54:30]  All right.  Well, we got that happening.  What time?  He has things to ask him.  In about an hour.  I'd like to ask him about some of the, some of the situations that are going on now in the  Middle East when he's not involved and if he, you know, how maybe he would like to see  a president handle things and, you know, does he feel left out?  What did he say to Gaddafi yesterday when they were right?  Yeah, yeah, when you were on the phone.  You think he's on the phone with Gaddafi?  He's got a bunch of phones in his house.  Gaddafi.  Right.  Fucking Ahmadinejad is in the other line. 
[00:55:00]  All right.  We're taking a call from fucking.  That's funny.  Yeah.  What do you think of the revolution going on out there?  Any, any thoughts on the whole Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Tunisia?  That's pretty exciting that people are pouring out on the streets of countries like that.  And then, and then guys are having to leave.  Yeah.  I mean, Gaddafi's crazy.  He was the guy, but he used to come to New York and go to Studio 54 and do Coke.  He did. 
[00:55:30]  He used to fly in New York.  He used to be in like the New York Post once in a while.  Gaddafi was at Studio 54 last night.  And he was one of those guys.  He would have been on TM, nowadays he would have been on TMZ.  TMZ, yeah.  And he doesn't come here anymore, but he used to.  No, he's just a guy who gets, you know, much pussy and gets high.  And he's been, so that was in the 80s.  Yeah.  So he's just been in like a deep, rich guy, crazy freeze.  You know, fucking hookers that get killed the next day.  Yeah. 
[00:56:00]  That kind of.  Without an inkling of ever being thrown out either.  No, and now he's like, what?  He's just herked up out of nowhere.  There's a, give me an umbrella.  I'll tell them.  He's completely lost.  He's obsessed with that umbrella, man.  He loves the umbrella.  What's that about?  Keeps the sun off of him?  I don't know.  But he's got the skin.  He can handle a little sun.  I don't know.  Didn't a comic once do a whole bit on him too?  It's like he's ahead of the place 40 years.  Yeah.  He's been ahead of this.  Why is he still just a colonel? 
[00:56:30]  Like somebody, somebody done something.  You can make yourself General Gaddafi.  Right.  Why does he insist on just.  He's been a colonel for 40 years.  That's a great point.  He hasn't really done anything.  Well, he just.  To merit.  No.  Not militarily speaking.  How does it end?  Suicide or, or the people take him out?  Well, he's, his rhetoric is quite.  Because they said he can't go anywhere.  He doesn't really have any country that.  No one wants him.  He doesn't take him anymore.  No, no.  He, and, and a lot of, uh, Libya now is all divided. 
[00:57:00]  I mean, um.  Well, it's funny that Egypt's.  That guy being overthrown.  Notice how he went muh.  And then.  Yeah.  Quit on knowing.  Muh.  Muh.  Fucking name.  Muh.  He's yesterday's news.  No, I didn't get my eyes.  Totally.  Yeah.  Nobody gives a shit that Egypt's government doesn't exist now.  Yeah.  There isn't one.  Well, they're mad though.  Already.  They're getting mad already.  They're going to protest again.  Cause they're mad at that, what the, uh, well, cause I don't think they want, uh, the military 
[00:57:30]  in charge until September.  Yeah.  That's not usually a good, uh, result of a revolution is to have the military in charge.  It's like, we'll take care of it.  They never had a guy though.  Yeah.  Usually you have a guy standing by ready to take over.  That's kind of great though.  To me, there wasn't a guy, it was really just the populace, right?  We don't like you.  Leave.  They didn't want it anymore.  And actually they went about it the right way is that they were, they're nonviolent  basically.  They didn't do anything.  And so they gave every world leader, uh, uh, a platform to say, you got to gang rape 
[00:58:00]  a white woman.  Do something.  It's about, they're only violent.  Well, that goes on all day in Egypt.  They pinched her really hard.  That's not a big deal.  They pinched her really hard.  The reports are coming in that she got pinched really hard.  Maybe her nipple got pinched.  Maybe.  No, definitely.  The sensitive areas they said got pinched really hard and she got beat with flagpoles.  They were calling her Jew, Jew, Jew.  Lara Logan.  I didn't know what you were talking about.  The white reporter.  You guys are really getting creative with this weird idea.  No, the white reporter they decided would be just fine in the square with a little security, 
[00:58:30]  meaning the camera guy that might have.  And she got pinched.  Might have taken a karate class once.  She got, she got pinched.  Really hard.  Beaten with flagpoles.  All the details.  Beaten with those flags they were, uh, carrying around the flagpoles.  Sexually assaulted.  Pissed on.  She got pinched where?  Bitten on her nipples.  She said in sensual areas.  In sensitive areas.  Or sensitive areas.  Sensual areas.  Sensual areas.  Sensual.  Sorry.  Pinched in sensual areas.  Sensual.  Sensual.  Sensitive areas.  Yeah.  Yeah, but what does that mean? 
[00:59:00]  Some hard nipple tweaks.  Yeah.  I don't know.  And then they were saying maybe some rape.  Maybe some rape.  Maybe a little rape.  Maybe a little rape.  Just a little rape.  And flagpoles.  And flagpoles and beatings.  And only imagine what happens with flagpoles.  Yelling Jew, Jew, Jew, Jew.  Even though she wasn't Jewish.  Right.  They got a little confused.  They love yelling Jew when they're beating people over there.  Yeah.  But now some of these other countries, like Libya, they think, all right, it worked there.  Now let's give it a try here. 
[00:59:30]  Sure.  And we'll make him leave.  He's not leaving.  He's bombing and shooting his people.  Yeah.  So that's a little different take on this whole thing.  Yeah.  He's actually strafing the crowds with jets.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's taking jet fighters and bombing and strafing them.  But a bunch of them, I guess, won't shoot.  Well, they're horrified.  A couple went to Malta, was it?  Yeah.  A couple.  And then a couple said, you know what?  I don't even need this plane anymore.  Yeah.  And they just ejected.  And said, fuck this.  Pulled a Maverick.  Right.  Said, get the...  I'm not doing this.  Yeah.  No, I remember that in the first war with Iraq, whichever one that was, I don't remember. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  Whenever that was.  First, you can ask Rumsfeld, they'll know.  Yeah.  They'll tell you.  And there was a thing, I remember on CNN, that a fleet of Iraqi jets, a squadron of Iraqi  jets had taken off.  Yeah.  And that they were going to hit Egypt.  And then they watched, I saw on the news on some map, they just turned around and went  to Syria and landed and asked for college education.  That was the end of it.  That was the end of the Iraqi Air Force.  The whole air force just left. 
[01:00:30]  And they must have gone from, yes, sir, you know, absolutely.  We are going to get every one of them.  Once they are in the air, they're like, what?  Yeah.  Let's turn this thing around.  Let's go to Morocco.  Fuck this.  They're going to kill us.  They just landed.  They're going to get our asses handed to us.  Mm-hmm.  That's...  But they're going to get Libya, right?  The people will get Libya eventually.  I don't know.  No one's really...  Is this going to be a tough one?  You know, this guy ain't going down.  Gaddafi isn't...  Yeah, but he has nobody.  I mean, that's like, we're leaving him.  Where does power come from?  Yeah, but he's still got...  He's still got enough people shooting at civilians. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Unarmed civilians.  He has a lot of money.  He probably has a lot of actually, like, gold bars.  It's going to come down to him giving some pilot a gold bar.  To just drop fucking napalm on his people.  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah, because he still has enough of that.  He's got enough money and enough power.  Well, these guys, the leaders, their lives are so weird.  Because they don't care, literally, about their countries.  They just are...  No.  They're like royalty. 
[01:01:30]  They're like gold European royalty.  Yeah, they don't care.  They're just people that live in the palace.  Yeah.  And they just eat shit and they make deals with other people.  It must get...  They sap the country's resources.  And so he...  The look on his face is like, I don't understand why I'm being asked to defend this.  This is just...  I'm a despot.  What part of that do you not understand?  This is what it is.  I stay till I'm dead.  When did this not...  Start not happening?  And then my kid takes over.  Yeah.  That's how it works.  My kid takes over. 
[01:02:00]  He's worse.  Yeah.  Because he was raised...  At least I fought to get here.  Yeah.  He was raised and was entitled.  He's going to be a kid who was raised in this decrepit, fucked up environment who's never  seen a poor people except for the ones we eat.  Yeah.  Always had complete impunity.  Yeah.  Now it's his turn.  He could just rape and pillage and kill without any consequence.  And now he's in charge.  Yeah.  Amazing.  That's the way the world's going to run.  I heard rivers, rivers of blood.  When you hear them, whenever they mention rivers of blood will flow. 
[01:02:30]  That's not good.  Not a good sign for the populace.  This guy says Qaddafi has a house in Jersey.  Brian in Philly.  Hey, good morning.  Opie, Anthony, Louis.  Bob Qaddafi.  Danny, if you could help us out, I've got to see if Qaddafi actually has a house in Jersey.  Where's his house?  Englewood, New Jersey.  He owns a property.  If you remember...  Oh, he pitched his tent in the backyard.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember that.  Yeah, when he was at the UN thing last year or the year before, he actually owns a property  in Englewood, New Jersey. 
[01:03:00]  And if things go really bad, he may end up, you know, there, but...  Oh, you think he'll end up there?  Yeah, you think we'll take him in?  Are we going to see him at Jets games next year?  Yeah, he's going to be on the floor at MSG with some popcorn.  Next to Spike Lee.  Yeah.  There's Muammar Qaddafi.  Talking to Woody Allen.  Just taking him the game.  With his weird little beard.  Just sitting next to his...  Former murderous dictator, Muammar Qaddafi, taking him the game.  Look at him.  Big fan.  Big Knicks fan.  Giving a peace sign for the jumbotron. 
[01:03:30]  What's up?  Yeah.  Five people.  Woo!  Yeah.  Wearing a Jersey Shore fucking shirt.  This guy used to live next to Qaddafi or his son or something.  What?  What's your neighbor, Qaddafi?  Well, all these guys have huge families.  Like, the guy in Egypt, the whole thing, and also, by the way, the leader of Afghanistan  that we support, they have big families.  The whole thing is these clans.  Yeah.  And they, whoever gets in charge just starts, they plug in, like, fucking ticks, and they 
[01:04:00]  start sucking the blood of the economies and giving all the money to their...  To their people.  To their people.  Not their people, but their family.  Well, to their clan.  Yeah.  And everybody who's a Qaddafi is fucking rich.  And then, meanwhile, Libya's getting grayer and less...  Like a tick.  Fruitful, yeah.  Like what a tick does.  And what?  The women are just constantly pregnant, I would assume.  Yeah.  They just keep...  You keep growing, and you send people out into the world, and, you know... 
[01:04:30]  It's fucked up.  It really is.  And to have such a resource...  They have so much fucking oil, Libya.  And to have that much money coming in, and the people are just impoverished, it is amazing.  Well, a lot of...  And even on every level.  Like, I once talked to a homeless guy in Union Square, or wherever it was, somewhere in New York.  I smoked some marijuana, which I'm not good at.  Like, I have to get away from people when I get high.  I was with some comedians and some... 
[01:05:00]  Doug Benson, who's a famous pot smoker.  And he gave me some pot, and I was like, okay, I'll see you later.  Because I can't be around anybody.  I can't smoke this with you.  So I got...  I was really high on 14th Street, just standing there.  And some guy says, you know, can you give me a dollar?  What is this guy?  Weird-looking, interesting guy.  And I gave him $100.  Jesus.  So that he would talk to me.  I just didn't want him to ask.  It was a big crowded area, and he could have been doing better.  Yeah, yeah.  So anyway, I asked him about his life, and he told me... 
[01:05:30]  He's from Pakistan.  And he told me his whole life that his father sold him to his uncle when he was, like, 12 years old.  And he was moved to Queens, where he worked in a gas station.  And he lived in a basement room of a gas station in Queens.  Of the basement of a gas station.  And he would just be brought upstairs, and he worked, like, 17-hour shifts.  He just worked until he would fall down.  And then they'd go down in the basement, and they'd put a little food in him.  And he said he was... 
[01:06:00]  He did that for something like 13 years.  Oh, God.  That's a slave.  That's a slave.  When he became too old to...  You know, once he became not a minor, you can't...  You know, then he becomes capable of suing him.  Yeah, filing charges and things like that.  So they just toss him out.  He said, then I didn't even have the gas station job.  And then so he had a few jobs, and now he's homeless.  But that's what...  You know, it was a family business thing.  Yeah, yeah.  And then they throw you out.  Wow.  Then you're out on your ass.  That's brutal. 
[01:06:30]  Let's go to...  Jesus Christ.  Michael, who lived next to one of the Gaddafis.  Michael, what's the story?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Louis C.K., by the way, in studio.  Louis, love your work.  Thank you.  Anyway, when I lived in Vienna, Austria, in the late 90s, I was in high school over there.  And one of his sons...  And Louis is 100% right.  He's got like 20 brothers and shit.  So he's over there, and he's studying in university.  And you'd think, like, a dictator's son would kind of have that same mentality. 
[01:07:00]  This guy's a complete fucking stoner.  Smokes pot constantly.  And he would run around and do all this crazy shit around the neighborhood.  But even though he was studying over there, he still had diplomatic immunity.  His dad sent him over there as, quote, a diplomat.  So he used to do all this crazy shit, throw parties.  He tried getting a tiger to live in his backyard for a while.  It was just...  They love that shit.  They love shit like that.  Well, and the thing is, that's what his father is. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Right.  That's the...  He's not...  It's not...  You know, dictators are not shrewd and, you know, really smart.  You know, Hitler was like a other thing.  These guys are like...  Gaddafi is one of 40 sons, or whoever his father was.  Yeah.  And he was the one who got this gig.  Yeah.  But he's fucking wasted all the time.  I'm pretty sure Gaddafi is on drugs.  Just fucked up.  He looked...  All the time.  He looked so fucked up when he was giving those speeches.  No, he cums too much.  Like, he just came on a teenager's face for the 50th time that day. 
[01:08:00]  When we saw him with the umbrella.  Yeah, yeah.  He just...  He was covered in whatever fucking tiger cum.  And he fucking...  Just had jizzed in some way that makes you not want to be in public so much.  Look at him with his umbrella.  You know, he smoked tons of...  Probably did all the kind of drugs, like, in, like, Last Lieutenant, whatever that shit  that was that he did that made him look so fucking...  Bad Lieutenant.  Yeah, and Bad Lieutenant. 
[01:08:30]  And how bad he looked in the mornings.  Like, that kind of drugs.  Those crystal meth drugs that really fuck you up.  Completely fuck you up.  And he's doing weird.  He probably...  He shat in some fucking guy's mouth while he came on his mother's face.  And then he killed everybody that he was involved with in a couple hours.  And...  Yeah, that's...  And then he woke up and was told, you're getting thrown...  What?  Ah!  Get me my umbrella.  I'm talking.  I've got to talk to these people around.  I'm talking.  I'm talking. 
[01:09:00]  Get me my umbrella.  So, did Michael...  You have a point to your caller, Mike?  What the hell are you talking about?  His son was...  Yeah, his son was just kind of eccentric.  He was kind of a cool guy.  Cool guy.  There you go.  And, you know, he got to do shit.  Diplomatic immunity is pretty great.  Unless you're in...  Where?  Afghanistan?  Is that where that guy is?  But supposedly some of the Bin Ladens are cool people, so...  Hey, possibly.  I mean, he was a great guy to hang out with.  Fucking looked like some 90s grunge flannel shirts and the long hair and all that. 
[01:09:30]  Stupid shit, so...  I don't know.  And he was a Katofi.  Yeah.  It's pretty odd.  No, I mean, Osama Bin Laden, he's got...  Oh, he's got family that was living here.  He's got family that were living and going to school in Boston.  Yeah.  And we got calls back then.  Oh, man, I knew that guy.  He was cool.  He had to leave school very quickly.  You got to have, like, you know, the bad guy in your family.  Yeah, I guess.  It's weird, though.  Oh, is that... 
[01:10:00]  Who is that?  Bin Laden's what?  Niece.  Niece?  Yeah, she was trying to get a modeling career going.  Yeah.  Kind of, you know, I think people are a little put off.  Yeah, it's weird.  It's kind of hard to really...  Tough to hire for a modeling gig.  I don't care how hot you think she is.  Yeah.  You're just like, eh.  Who's going to be the brave guy to do that?  Ginger Bin Laden.  She's not really...  Yeah.  Right, right.  And it's like, eh, but, you know, yeah, she's the niece of the guy, you know, the towers  and, ah, well...  Yeah, the tower thing. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know if we really want to make her represent our new fashion line that's coming  out.  Well, look, Louie's got a sandwich in front of him.  Why don't we take a quick break?  Fine by making.  I want to talk about this bench, the sex bench with the pot and the sex.  Oh, yeah, there's pot and sex going on.  I don't know.  A little tease out there, Louie.  Oh, wow, radio tease.  We've got a bench that people are having sex on and smoking some pot.  And where is that? 
[01:11:00]  But the bench is dedicated to a very famous individual.  Oh, so you can never keep those things sacred or safe or anything.  I think it's a good idea to name a bench after someone thinking that people would take  it very seriously and just have a nice little lunch there.  I bet there was an unveiling when it was first put there.  A pomp and circumstance and everything nice.  And now people are just fucking and smoking pot.  Yeah, it's a horrific bench.  Louie C.K. promoting the Borgata. 
[01:11:30]  April 23rd.  Tickets go to Borgata.com.  Are you going to go down and see Louie?  I love the Borgata and I love Louie, so yeah.  If I can sell it, I think we've got like 500 tickets left for that show.  If I can sell it out, we'll add a second show.  If I can sell it out by the end of this month, then we'll add a second show.  I would really like to do that because then I get more money to spend on things that I  like to put in my body.  So 500 tickets if we sell them today.  Let's do this for Louie. 
[01:12:00]  You know you're going to have a good time.  Sell it out.  Right.  Where are we going?  D-Boy came up with this.  Based on Bob Kelly's brand new fucking character, Billy the Bassman.  He's one of the biggest comedy names in Middle America and south of the Mason-Dixon line.  Let's have a give it up.  It's Billy the Bassman.  Where are we going?  All right, now settle down.  Where are we going?  I'll tell you where we're going to go to funny land.  He's back with an all-new CD, Where Are We Going?  What a termite is he for breakfast. 
[01:12:30]  I love Billy.  Old meal.  Where are we going?  Fat, uneducated slobs are calling it a comedic masterpiece.  Did you hear about the lookalike competition in China?  Yeah, everybody won.  Jim Crow is rolling in his grave with laughter.  Fuck that.  Rock that.  I hate the fucking.  Just like you do.  Where are we going?  Move over, Larry the Cable Guy.  There's a new bland, predictable redneck in town.  All right, what's Mary short for?  She's got no legs. 
[01:13:00]  Where are we going?  It's Billy the Bassman and his all-new CD,  Where Are We Going?  Available now at truck stops and Cracker Barrels everywhere.  Call the O.P. and Anthony Show.  866-1211.  That's 866-969-1969.  We've got Louis C.K. in the studio. 
[01:13:30]  April 23rd, the Borgata Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City.  That's a great gig for Louis.  And, man, you should go see him, obviously.  I saw Louis.  Oh, we talked about it the last time you were in a Carnegie Hall.  What an amazing show.  Thanks, man.  That's an amazing show.  Yeah, it's perfect for it.  It's such a cool place.  Perfect for it.  It's the only place in Atlantic City that's...  It really is like Vegas, kind of.  It's got that Vegas vibe.  It doesn't feel like...  Like, I stayed in another hotel right on the boardwalk once, 
[01:14:00]  and it felt like I stepped into the 70s.  And it feels like you're in Atlantic City.  Yeah, yeah.  You know you're in Atlantic City.  The Borgata could trick you into thinking,  Man, I took a fucking flight to Vegas.  I went to Vegas.  That's exactly the difference, yeah.  There's some old diner waitress bringing the drinks at this other casino,  bringing the drinks to the table,  and you're just like,  Oh, and then you look at the Borgata babes and shit,  walking around.  They're just stunning.  No, the other Atlantic City places,  it's like you're faced with the economy you're hurting  with everything you do. 
[01:14:30]  There's supposed to be more of a buffer there.  Yeah, yeah.  Where you can get lost in it.  But Atlantic City, the dealer looks at you like,  Thanks for fucking up my hometown, asshole.  Would you like another card?  Like, they just look depressed.  God damn, that is it.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  My father owned a house,  and now I live in a fucking shack.  Right.  So that you could play blackjack.  Hope you're having fun.  Yeah.  Oh, look, blackjack.  I would hit on that, yes.  You so see the corruption.  All you have to do is just drive around a little bit, 
[01:15:00]  less than a mile from those beautiful casinos,  and you realize they don't give a fuck about the local economy.  No.  It's all being sucked out.  I don't know where that money's going.  It's another kind of tick, but it's a remote.  It's like, it doesn't even spread nearby.  No.  It's like a scientific taking money.  It's like a tick that has a long-distance sucker.  Yeah.  They must have helicopters at night that literally lift it up into the sky.  To make sure it does not touch.  Even touch the local economy.  Anybody there.  And the politicians, they obviously just look the other way. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  It's like, you're not even going to throw a dollar into the economy?  No.  Who are you talking about?  Yeah.  What are you trying to say?  What are you trying to say?  What are you trying to say?  Who are you saying is doing this?  What, what, what, what, what?  You're right.  Yeah, exactly.  We're already in a weird spot with Donald Rumsfeld.  I bet he knows where that money goes.  You know what?  I think Atlantic City's beautiful.  Oh, you've got to go there.  It's beautiful.  The Borgata.  It's fantastic.  Go see Louisville.  Jobs. 
[01:16:00]  They got jobs.  They got jobs everywhere.  Jobs.  Jobs.  Jobs.  How many people they employ?  Jobs.  There weren't those jobs when it was before the casinos?  No.  No, there was just a really kind of a nice area.  Steel Pier.  What the hell happened?  Where someone could actually open a store and try to have a business instead of a job.  But now they got jobs.  They get to wear a vest.  And deal cards to fucking assholes and Qaddafis.  Yeah, Qaddafis.  They get to fucking...  Oh, that's great.  Jobs.  Jobs.  You mean people just open up their own family business down there? 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  Like bakery.  Like delicatessen.  Yeah, wherever the fucking, wherever the Trump down there is.  Does he have one down there?  Oh, he's got the Taj and the Marina.  I don't know how much he actually really owns.  Yeah, the Trump Marina is sitting where some guy used to have an old fish restaurant.  He had the restaurant from 1850 in his family.  And now it's a fucking Trump Marina hotel.  It is right there on the wall.  I worked that fucking place.  Or it was the Trump Castle it was called.  I don't know where that is now.  Yeah, I think they changed the name at some point. 
[01:17:00]  But I did.  I worked at Trump Castle.  And I remember just watching people.  I had never really been down there before.  And I'm just watching these fucking old ladies from around the country come on buses.  Like from the middle of Ohio or Kentucky, literally.  Like you see a bus that says like Lexington, Kentucky.  And they fuck.  And these fucking old women come out of the bus.  And they took a medical hit from the trip. 
[01:17:30]  Like you just see them.  And they get out of these fucking buses they were in for hours, days.  Yeah.  Blood just clotting in their legs.  Helping each, you know, the 60 year olds helping the 70 year olds off the bus.  And they go get shit rooms.  Yeah.  And then they pour buckets of fucking coins.  All of their fucking retirement.  All they got left.  They just pour it in buckets into these machines.  And then they leave.  Leave.  And then so I'm watching all this and it all says Trump all over it. 
[01:18:00]  And then I was in an elevator and Trump got on.  With Marla Maples at the time.  And everyone was like, oh, there they are.  They were really excited.  They saw them.  Oh my God, there's Trump and the woman he's fucking illicitly.  And they get on the elevator and Trump looked miserable.  I was in the elevator alone with him just by chance.  And he just looked miserable.  He looked so unhappy.  Yeah.  And all that money I realized is a weird like he has all this billions of dollars. 
[01:18:30]  But he's fucking miserable because he needs a hundred billion to look in the mirror and not want to kill himself.  He needs that.  These old ladies from Kentucky, they don't need anything.  They have like maybe a thousand dollars in the bank.  Right.  It's like they're coming.  It's like a religion.  Like they're coming to help him feel better.  Like they're coming to give him money.  Giving him the money.  He's like, I have a hundred billion dollars and I don't fucking fuck everybody.  It's not enough.  And these old ladies are like, I have maybe a thousand. 
[01:19:00]  You can have all of it.  I'll give you all of it.  I'll take a bus all day to give it to you.  We could have pumped it into our own economy where we live.  Yeah.  I could have given it to my neighbor's store that closed last week.  But I figured I'd come all this way just to dump it into this machine.  Hopefully make you a little happier.  Yeah.  That's classic.  With the only buffer being this vague hope that I might leave with more.  Yeah.  That I may be one of the trillions.  But it ain't going to happen.  No.  So it was just poor, poor money.  I want to know more about the family fish business. 
[01:19:30]  The little restaurant that was there.  That poor guy.  That's, forget that.  With his little boat.  Maybe a little bait shop.  He would just go out every day.  Bait shop on the pier.  No, he used to wipe off the table when you walked in.  And he would feel real proud.  Nice.  You'd smell like the ocean air.  It was open windows in the summer.  What was his last day like, you think?  Wrecking ball.  A bunch of suits and ties.  A wrecking ball with the whole family just outside crying.  Yeah.  And now in that exact same spot.  It's ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, God.  That's all you did.  It was Donald Trump and a bunch of other guys in suits with golden shovels taking that photo of them breaking ground.  And in back is the boarded-up fish place, just ready to be plowed asunder.  That was there for 150 years.  You know, and it's not the fault of some corporations or Donald Trump.  It's like Walmart kills all small town economists. 
[01:20:30]  But it's not Walmart's fault.  It's the fault of the fucking people.  I used to have a house upstate in upstate New York, and there was a town that held these beautiful old diners and general stores, and they all closed one by one because of Walmart.  But it wasn't fucking Walmart's fault.  It was the people that lived in that town that don't give a shit about their neighbors.  But is it giving a shit?  It's the American basic consumer who's like, well, okay, I could spend 13 cents less on a mop, so fuck my fucking neighbor. 
[01:21:00]  Fuck my neighbor who's had that store in his family for, you know, who's taking care, you know, there's like a million George Bailey moments in there, that town's history, where the whole, well, I'll give a check to your, you know, baseball teams with names, John's General Store.  Right.  Like those, the whole community coming together to do stuff.  Yeah.  Fuck that.  I want to buy a Jim Carrey movie three-pack for $7, so fuck the old movie theater with a Wurlitzer organ. 
[01:21:30]  But think of, like, think of Blockbuster Video.  Now, that caused a big thing because it pretty much closed down all the little mom-and-pop video stores.  Yeah.  Which was a great family business.  Which was a family business and shit like that.  I remember those things and having to go in and you'd have to buy a membership fee when you first get in when it was like a hundred bucks.  And that was just to try to keep the store alive.  Yeah, to keep the store open.  But then Blockbuster came around.  Now, what do you want to do?  Go into the mom-and-pop and wait a week for the latest release?  Yeah, why don't you? 
[01:22:00]  Why don't you fucking wait a little bit?  I want it now.  So fuck the family that opened that store.  Yeah.  And by the way, fuck them that they used to think about what movies you might like.  That you might walk in and they go, Anthony, you like comedies.  Anthony, we got a whole section for you.  Do you even know who Francois Tati is?  And they'd show you something that we went and found this.  Blockbuster would never do that for you.  Fuck them.  I agree with both of you, but...  So that you can save a little bit of fucking money.  The local place that Anne's talking about, you had to wait for some asshole to bring 
[01:22:30]  back the nice new movie.  It's out.  You'd be like, it's out.  It's like, what?  When is it coming back?  I want to watch that fucking thing.  Yeah, so again, fuck that.  And then Blockbuster said, look, we could just put a hundred copies on the shelf.  So you're thinking the whole loyalty thing should outweigh the convenience?  Absolutely, because you're supporting somebody who is...  There's a human being and a family who's living off that business, and they  give a shit about you.  By the way, where's Blockbuster? 
[01:23:00]  It's fucking gone, so they leave a vacuum.  You can't rent a fucking video anymore.  But why would you?  Digital delivery.  If there was video stores...  You know why?  It's like bookstores.  A bookstore is not just a place where you can buy books.  It's a place where somebody expresses themselves by deciding what books to put out there and  what books they want to offer their community.  Right.  And that gets replaced by Barnes & Nobles, which means you get the same fucking books  that every place in the world gets.  I mean, not just America. 
[01:23:30]  Right.  Every bookstore has exactly the same books now.  I mean, that's a...  People don't realize what a massive...  It used to be.  You go to that bookstore, you're going to get some weird off-color books of this kind,  or you're going to get maybe a right-wing bookstore, a left-wing bookstore.  That used to be how people fucking...  And then so Barnes & Nobles comes, and the difference is a family business will hang  on through the tough years if they have half a chance, but a corporate business will go,  oh, we're not making a $10 trillion, just pull up stakes, and they're gone. 
[01:24:00]  So now there's no more fucking bookstores.  That's fucking amazing.  Or video stores.  Yeah.  No bookstores, no video stores.  Right.  Yeah.  The big Barnes & Noble on the Upper West.  Yeah.  Because those are predatory businesses.  Given your thinking, though, wouldn't we never progress?  Like, wouldn't...  Who's progressing?  That's the...  Well, I mean, with everything.  Like, wouldn't we not...  Look at the automotive business, which is horrible now, of course, because of the outsourcing 
[01:24:30]  and everything.  But early on, there were guys working those lines.  What about the technology to come in and use robots that did eliminate jobs, but it makes  the car better and faster and...  Yeah, but that's exactly the thing.  These things like bookstores and video stores, they weren't improved.  They were destroyed.  And a book is not a car.  It's not a product that needs to be perfected like a technology.  It's about having a way of life.  But now you just download it on Kindle.  Yeah.  Like, exactly.  But it's rubbed out a whole getting out of your house and going to a bookstore and meeting 
[01:25:00]  the bookstore guy and other people.  You used to get fucking laid by going to bookstores.  A way that people used to get laid is by going to a bookstore and standing in a section that  makes you look smart.  And then a chick comes around.  Yeah.  Oh, do you also like this book?  I'm perusing this book.  Yeah.  You can't do that anymore.  When I grew up in Boston and there was a place in Harvard Square called the Coffee Connection.  And this was a place that was obsessed with coffee.  And they had coffees from all around the world.  And they'd have stuff like you'd get a cappuccino and they'd shave chocolate onto it. 
[01:25:30]  Not like a canister of chocolate powder.  It took time.  I mean, they had a cheese grater and a block of chocolate and they'd shred chocolate onto  the fucking thing for you.  That's like how good it was.  You sound like my grandfather.  My grandfather talking to me.  You don't even understand the old days.  No, you have no idea.  I know the point you're not to make, man.  You'd go to the fucking Coffee Connection and you'd sit there like trembling.  And they'd bring you this thing that would just change your life. 
[01:26:00]  They'd go, hey, you want to try Turkish?  We have a new Turkish coffee today.  It's a weird thing.  Never tried it.  So then Starbucks opens down the street.  But this Coffee Connection hangs on.  So Starbucks opens another one like on the other side of them.  Starbucks isn't doing so great that they can open another one.  They're just trying to fucking kill.  Oh, shit.  So they open like five within a block of the place until Coffee Connection goes,  this is getting hard.  And they sell themselves. 
[01:26:30]  They go, let's just be at Starbucks.  Yeah.  So then Starbucks buys them and then closes the other ones.  And then you're just left with fucking just one choice.  You get Starbucks.  And the quality of Starbucks is horrible now.  It's okay.  And instant Starbucks isn't making a profit.  They'll give up.  And then there won't be a fucking place to even get coffee.  Right.  Then we go back to having no coffee again.  No coffee.  He's right.  I remember the lumber stores.  I remember we did a lot of renovation on our old house because we had seven kids,  a small house, where we were constantly adding rooms and this and that. 
[01:27:00]  Mom and pop lumber shops.  Mom and pop.  Yeah.  I would get in the car with my dad.  I remember like it was yesterday.  We'd go to the local lumber guy.  He knew my dad's first name.  We got this for you.  We made your pile.  It's all set.  Putting a dormer on the house, are you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you're going to need some of that.  No, no.  I'll come over here.  I'll help you out.  You need that for the joists.  But it was a social thing, too, man.  How are the kids?  Lumber stores were very social.  Right.  And then the Home Depot.  It's a fucking massive warehouse and no one wants to fucking help you. 
[01:27:30]  It's inhumane.  You're just mad right when you walk in.  And there's sad people working there.  Right.  The buying of the lumber is not a happy exchange.  It used to be that you could say to yourself, you know what?  If I invest in a good saw and I get some trucks, I could go out and get some fucking  poplar and cut it well, and people will come here and build fucking houses with it.  Yeah.  And you go and you go, hey, you got some nice poplar.  Not as good as Joe Wilson's.  Yeah.  Well, mine is down three cents.  Right.  I'll buy yours.  This was like a...  Yeah.  And by the way, we don't improve through this shit. 
[01:28:00]  No.  We actually don't.  It's like...  It's...  What happens is the second place product always wins by being more vicious to take over.  Yeah.  It's like Microsoft versus Apple.  Right.  Microsoft is bullshit software.  It's horrible.  Compared to Apple...  I know.  Believe me.  It's horrible.  But Bill Gates is a capitalist and he was vicious and he fought Apple for some years anyway.  Yeah.  Yeah.  America lived on shitty computer technology because of his ambition. 
[01:28:30]  It was a point where we all thought Apple was gone.  Yeah.  It was dead.  VHS versus beta.  Beta is still used today.  Yeah.  Beta videotape is still what most TV shows are shot on.  Yeah.  And we all watched VHS tapes because the VHS people said, we make the second best, so we're  going to be cutthroat and fucked up and pay off people and go to litigation and like sue  beta.  And beta's like, we just...  Well, we're making the best kind. 
[01:29:00]  We can't even get people to buy it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And so everyone gets VHS.  Unbelievable.  It's Tesla and fucking Edison.  Edison and Tesla, yeah.  One guy's a genius and is selling a beautiful thing.  The second in this place guy copies it, doesn't do it as well, and then takes him to court  in every fucking state in America and muscles him and fights him and outdraws him.  Ruins his credibility.  Gets some fucking Texan to pay for it.  And then we all have to buy the shitty product.  You're fucking brilliant. 
[01:29:30]  It's true.  It's the same with cars.  They would be better if what you're saying was actually true.  If it was like the guys still on the assembly line.  Yeah.  But your coffee story is deeply depressing.  It is.  What happens everywhere.  I was thinking, as you were talking about that, like the Starbucks popping up are like  weeds.  Yes.  Taking out the really nice fucking crop.  Nice flowers.  That's what they do.  And they're only interested in...  They're just putting weeds all over the place to destroy it.  That's right.  And they don't even make money.  Like Harvard Square is a good example. 
[01:30:00]  I love Harvard Square.  It's been a while, but...  I love that place.  You won't love it next time you go.  It's been years.  There used to be a place called the Tasty and like the Verst House, all these places  that have been there from the 1900s.  It's a sunglass hut and an Abercrombie and Fitch now.  Jesus.  And I was talking to one of the local business guys who owns a cigar store.  He's like the last guy left.  Look at you.  No, I'm the shit fascinates me.  He's a business man.  And I asked him, are you going to go under too?  And he said, you know what?  Because he went to Harvard Business School and then he opened his little cigar store. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, God.  He said Abercrombie and Fitch in Harvard Square doesn't even make a profit.  They lose money every day.  They're not...  That store, the rent is so high for what they built there that they can't...  They could sell jeans all day.  They're not going to make a profit.  They're not there to make a profit.  It's just a billboard.  It's a 3D billboard.  It's there so that you'll buy Abercrombie online and to keep it visible.  In your mind, in your head.  That's fascinating.  There's like the Nike store on 50th or whatever.  All those stores, they don't make a fucking dime. 
[01:31:00]  They lose money every day.  It's worth having a giant...  The global...  It's like a billboard.  Yeah.  That you walk into.  That's how far away this is from like...  The mom and pop guy.  Guy has an idea.  Right.  Puts it out there.  I love it.  This folks love it.  And they start buying it.  It's not even...  Wow.  We're not even close to that anymore.  Like I'm nostalgic for the guy who started Wendy's.  Like that's...  That's now like a great American.  He's like a revolutionary.  A great American story.  Yeah.  Or Ray Kroc from McDonald's. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  He's like Che Guevara or whatever his name is.  He's like, oh, great man.  They're sort of making a comeback.  But remember just the local burger joint was cool.  Are they making a comeback?  A little bit.  You see more burger joints popping up.  Maybe they're a part of a whole corporate thing.  Well, like in New York, there's five guy burgers here.  Right, right, right.  But when we were growing up, every town had its local burger guy.  And they bragged about their burger.  And it was better than the guy's burger from the next town over.  And then you watch those slowly. 
[01:32:00]  The one in Huntington, the Choo Choo Hamburger place.  Oh, right, right.  And their thing was, well, we'll bring your burger on a nice fucking train right in front  of you.  Right.  Oh, here comes my order.  You see it fucking rocking the restaurant.  It comes around and stops at your counter spot.  Well, that's what it used to be like when things were more spread out that everyone had to have  their own idea of here's why you want to come here.  And then I think instead of like if you come here, it doesn't matter because we're across  the street, too.  Right.  Fuck you.  Just eat this shit.  You think it's going to get better?  Once these big companies take over, the product goes down. 
[01:32:30]  What do you think about like online purchasing then?  You must do a lot of that, though.  Yeah, I do.  Yeah.  No, I think that's probably the next version of it is that you can throw together a little  product and sell it online.  And just be the mom and pop online thing.  Yeah, because you don't need a store anymore.  And then someone will figure out how to fuck that over.  Yeah.  But you can't because it's not real estate.  You can't take over.  You can't push somebody off the Internet.  Yeah.  They'll always be there.  That's true.  But you can be the better online or the bigger. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, they'll make you have the website with .org.  Yeah.  They'll give you a .something that no one does.  But if you're like a mom and pop thing and you're selling, let's say, electronics, you'd be  like, oh, great.  They don't have that.  Let me go to Best Buy's website.  Fucking no.  No, that's absolutely true.  That's hard to sell.  Yeah.  Just to add to the discussion, I used to be a big music store guy.  And every music store was a little different.  And this guy, if you got to know him, he's like, I got some fucking bootlegs you might  want to see.  That's right. 
[01:33:30]  And it's completely illegal.  And we know it.  But I've seen you in this place enough times that I know you're not a rat.  So why don't you follow me?  Well, that's exactly it.  Guys like Iggy Pop.  Iggy Pop becoming popular was a good thing, I think, for America.  It's a good thing for the American voice that guys like that would.  But the reason he came up was because certain record stores would go, I'm fucking digging  Iggy Pop, and I'm going to make a, I'm going to sort of take a gamble that my customers  will like him.  Right.  Right.  So they'd go, they'd order, like, give me 10 Iggy Pop, you know, 12 inches. 
[01:34:00]  And they'd put them out there.  Right.  And the kid with the leather jacket, who the fuck is this guy?  Right.  I'd try him out, kid.  You're right, old man.  Fuck you.  You know.  And he'd try Iggy Pop, and he'd go, holy motherfucking shit.  And all of a sudden, Iggy Pop is flying off the shelves.  When I was growing up.  But now, if you're not on fucking iTunes, like, the whole country has to make one decision  of who we like.  There's no sort of local guy.  God, that's fucking...  That's a massive, massive difference in how the culture grows.  I just loved, when I was growing up, I would go to the village and all those underground 
[01:34:30]  record stores.  I would spend all afternoon there.  And every place had something a little different.  So what is this?  And bootleg, like, concert shirts.  Like, what's the bottom line of what this does to society?  No one even has, even young people don't even consider the idea that it's a good idea to  be off, out in the fringe, which is where good ideas come from.  Like, people are almost, like, begging the government to take over, and the corporations  to take over your life.  Like, people are excited that when you take a picture of yourself on your phone and put 
[01:35:00]  it online, it says where the fuck you were.  Why are people excited about that?  Yeah, what is that?  Like, I remember when Easy Pass first happened.  Everyone was like, I don't want everybody knowing when I went to the Lincoln Tunnel.  Like, what are you, fucking carrying secret documents?  Who the fuck is the shit about you?  But people used to think that way.  Cameras in Central Park for crime?  Yeah, but what about my privacy?  But now people are like, guess what?  If I take a picture and send it to somebody, the whole world knows exactly where I was.  Where I was at that given moment.  And I can store all of everything I have on a computer in North Carolina. 
[01:35:30]  And they get to have all my stuff.  And Facebook knows who all my friends are.  And what I've said to all of them.  Every single fucking conversation I've ever had is a public record in the fucking Library  of Congress.  Yay!  Cool!  That is fucked up.  Isn't that cool?  And we worried about Easy Pass a mere three years ago.  People were excited.  Three years ago, right.  If ever that you tell somebody, I think I might be pregnant. 
[01:36:00]  It's in the Library of Congress now.  Forever.  Cool!  And there's a fucking geo tag on it saying where you were standing when you fucking said it.  A fucking coordinate.  Yeah.  A global coordinate.  Of where you were standing.  Of where you were standing.  Of where you said that.  And when you took a picture.  But we didn't want to use Easy Pass three years ago.  That is really fucked up.  It's sick.  It is really fucked up. 
[01:36:30]  You have to belong to a fucking club to listen to a song.  You have to have a credit card to listen to a song.  You can't go buy a record and play it.  You have to.  If you fucking lose your credibility and your iTunes account gets suspended, you can't play  any of your music on anything.  You're done.  You can't listen to that word on satellite radio.  You have to subscribe.  Yes.  To listen to the radio.  Like the only way to listen to music without being a credible American citizen with a  credit card at belonging to a corporation. 
[01:37:00]  The only way you can fucking whistle.  That's about the only way.  That's how you're going to hear the song.  That's the only.  Whistling to yourself.  The only time you can.  Unless you want to join some.  Yeah.  Because there are a lot of the music stores don't even carry fucking.  There's no music stores.  There's no music stores.  You got to go to Best Buy.  And they got their CD section, which is dying out.  It's being pushed.  Yeah.  And it's just.  And it's just a reflection of what's on iTunes and what's on Amazon.  You don't have a guy taking care of that section, so it's all just kind of willy-nilly. 
[01:37:30]  You're not finding something new and eclectic.  No.  The problem.  And the problem is what Louie's getting at is with corporate America, only a few of the  people in corporate America actually make the money.  And the decision.  Then everyone else is just slaves to that fucking corporation.  And they're not even American.  I mean, it's all offshore.  All the companies are unaccountable and they're offshore.  And most of them are foreign owned anyway.  Yeah.  Go with the Tower Records.  Each Tower Records probably was easily 10 mom and pop record stores.  And those guys were actually making a real living. 
[01:38:00]  And now, like you said about Atlantic City, Tower Records moves in and now you used to  make a living.  Now you're just working for that schmuck.  Yep.  And then Tower Records is gone.  Tower's gone.  So they leave a vacuum.  It's not even this idea that everybody's like, yeah, but come on.  But this is good for what?  The convenience is like, but who's benefiting?  They just come in, eat, eat it all, and then they're gone and nothing's left.  I know, but still it's probably, you know, if we didn't do that, you wouldn't have the  thing that, uh...  We wouldn't have the polio vaccine. 
[01:38:30]  The cars run worse than they did in the 70s.  And I could go back...  You need a computer to fix one.  Yeah, you can't work on your car.  No.  That's true, too.  You cannot pop the hood on your fucking car and work on it.  I'm full around a little bit.  I remember if your car stalled, you would ease over a shoulder and you'd lift the hood  and you'd look.  And you'd fuck around with it.  And you'd be like, all right, I know enough about the distributor.  I think this is something...  I think maybe...  Let me see if that's tight.  Yeah, I think...  Are you going to tighten this a little bit?  My points are touching. 
[01:39:00]  I'm going to jiggle this cord, right?  I'm going to gap it with a matchbook cover.  That'll get me home.  You could actually do that.  That'll get me home.  It'll run a little fucked up, but that'll get me home.  Yeah, you could do that.  If you knew where the fuel pump was, you could jiggle it a little bit.  Yeah, give it a little knock.  If you caught it and start...  You hit the starter a little bit.  And then...  I had a 68 Mustang and I used to fix it.  I worked in a garage when I was younger and I used to fix it.  So, like, the fuel pump would go...  Like, the fuel pump that was in there since 1968 died in, like, 1993. 
[01:39:30]  And then I put in a new fuel pump.  And that fuel pump died in 1995.  And I went through three fuel pumps on that car.  Same...  Every part of it.  The starter that this car was made...  That was put in by some fucking heavy Michigan hands in 1968.  When I was one year old, some fucking guy with a cigarette dangling put that starter in.  Yeah, yeah.  And then went to a very beautiful home in Flint, Michigan, which is now a fucking crack house.  He's been dead for years. 
[01:40:00]  His white picket fence.  Yes.  His wife was waiting for him to come home.  And then finally that starter that he fucking personally tightened every part of finally  just went, I can't do it anymore, and died in 1994.  Yeah.  And then I took it out, and it was heavy, and it was beautiful.  It was like a piece of art.  And then I put it in with this...  I put in this thing I got at a parts store.  And I asked them, I said, give me the best starter available.  And they gave me this starter.  And the metal it was made out of is some weird composite.  You could see, like, Coke can pieces in it. 
[01:40:30]  And I put it in to weigh anything.  And I stuck it in, and it lasted like six months.  Yeah.  And it just came apart.  When you used to drop the starter motor, it was like, when you pulled those bolts out,  it was heavy.  Yep.  And then the new one, you're holding up with one arm as you're threading the fucking bolt.  Look at the picture Danny just found.  You can't work on that engine.  You can't work on that engine.  Just a big block with a logo on it. 
[01:41:00]  Right.  That's it.  That's a Cadillac.  It looks like it just all melted together.  You can't get at it.  It's all just cowling that they put on so you dare not even look and see what's under there.  You can't work on it because it's all computerized.  Now if your car breaks down.  You've got to hook a computer up to it in a corporate place.  If it breaks down, you're lucky enough to get out of your own car.  Yeah.  Might not even let you out.  Right.  You'd be lucky if you could at least leave the car.  Holy shit.  I keep going back to the coffee thing because I was a big coffee guy as well. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  And when Starbucks did hit, it made it convenient that there were more nice coffee places around  because you really had to search them out like you were talking about.  Right.  And I didn't live anywhere near Harvard Square, so a Starbucks was like, nice, instead of  a shitty diner coffee.  Right.  But then Starbucks didn't care about their product in the end.  No.  At first, the coffee was amazing.  Yes, because they had to compete.  But you watched it drop over the years.  Yeah, they had to.  They had to compete.  Now you know the beans they're getting have to be just shitty.  Of course they are.  They have to be.  They're not going to work hard for your money. 
[01:42:00]  Why would they?  They've got it.  At first, they needed your money, so they worked hard for it.  Exactly.  I explain this shit to my kids all the time because we'll go off the beaten path.  We'll go three blocks over and spend 40 more cents.  That what are we doing with this precious money that people are like, well, I'm saving so that  I can buy some fucking video game, have a video game experience for 10 seconds that evaporates  from my existence later.  What are we saving the money for?  But we go a few blocks over, spend a few more cents to go to like a butcher. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Instead of going to, you know, that price chopper, we go to a fucking New York City butcher.  Yeah.  Where the guy's got a red face.  How you doing, my man?  Fucking blood all over his fucking little apron that he's wearing.  Gets his steaks from a fucking place where there's like a direct line from the cow to the steak.  Yeah, instead of this fucking shop right, you know, probably some human parts in the steak  thing. 
[01:43:00]  I was going to, like, somebody go, oh, you want to get something for lunch?  Let's go to like Subway or something.  I'm like, why would you not just go to a deli?  Like, you get a real sandwich made on a hero roll that was in a bakery that morning and  the driver took it over.  A place where they're not going to measure the meat.  I remember I was a guy where the local guy goes, oh, Anthony, you know, you've been a  good customer.  Here's a few extra slices.  The Subway, they actually weigh their meat and their tomatoes to make sure it's the proper 
[01:43:30]  weight.  I was in a Subway once in somewhere in Arizona and I was driving across the country and I  stopped and it was a Subway inside of a fucking Sunoco station.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And there was the fucking kid working there was this depressed looking kid with his,  they cut his own hair like there was chunks, cut his own hair, skinny fucking, just depressed  looking, pale American.  And the kid he's serving is this exact same person.  Oh, shit.  Like he's just barely, just different colored version. 
[01:44:00]  You know, like in Star Wars, there was R2-D2, but then there'd be like a red version of it.  It's the red R2-D2.  It's just kind of basic.  And one guy, and he's going, what kind of sauce do you want on?  And he's like, um, and like, I guess I'll get, go ahead and get the green one.  And he's making it for him.  And I wanted him to say, should I just eat it too?  Does it even make a difference which one of us eats it?  Like, everyone's just on one side of the counter or the other. 
[01:44:30]  There's no identity to any American.  The only identity you have is what your sauce choice is.  Yeah.  Like, that's the only thing you get now is like, well, I like, I particularly like.  You do make this grim kind of image of, I don't see, I don't see this going to a good place.  No, it's not, man.  No, it's not, man.  No, it's not, man.  The only good thing that could happen is that it all falls.  That it just all collapses.  It all dies.  And everyone has to look around them and go, what could I piece together itself? 
[01:45:00]  Maybe recycle myself a little bit.  Maybe.  Post-apocalyptic lifestyle.  Would be terrific.  Yeah.  We got a timing issue, so we're going to take a break because we got Rummy calling right at 830.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Just Rummy.  Rummy.  Donald Rumsfeld.  Can't wait.  His new book, Known and Unknown, excuse me, a memoir.  You think we'll know some of the unknown?  I ain't so.  You think he's going to fest with the unknown?  I'm not saying a word.  You know, I'm going to go ahead and tell those Opie and Anthony fellas stuff that I never told anybody.  There's the show I'm going to break all the news on. 
[01:45:30]  More with Louis C.K.  He's just.  That was a good time as any to tell him that Gerald Ford is still alive.  Why not?  Why not these guys?  Why don't we ask him that weird shit?  See what he says.  I've had a Roswell.  Louis is killing this morning, and Louis C.K. is going to be at the Borgata April 23rd.  For tickets, go to Borgata.com.  B-O-R-G-A-R-T.  No, that's not it.  What? 
[01:46:00]  It misspelled the website, right?  That's awesome.  Borgata.  There's no R in the end of Borgata, right?  Borgata.  Google it.  No, it's B-O-R-G-A-T-A.com for tickets for Louis C.K.  You know what?  If you just have a computer to go online, right?  Right.  Just Google the fucking thing.  Yeah, Borgata.  Does anybody need to know the website?  How do you spell it really?  Anything you can't spell, just throw it in.  Even the browsers, finally, you just put it in the URL.  Right, right.  Someone figured out these fucking people don't get it.  They said, hey, dummy, this is how it's really spelled. 
[01:46:30]  Just write it with your finger on the screen.  Right, we'll figure it out.  I don't even use dictionary.com or Miriam website.  I'll just go to Google, type in the word that I know I'm misspelling.  And it says, did you mean the correct spelling?  Now you know the correct spelling.  I know.  Yeah.  We don't even need to know it.  You can continue spelling it wrong after that.  You know, you used to have to go to a library and speak to the librarian about that.  That's right.  And she would direct you to a book.  That's right.  Libraries used to be kind of cool, too.  Libraries.  In New York, it's very different. 
[01:47:00]  It's just that's where homeless people shit now.  Oh, speaking of which, we got the bench story.  Oh, yes.  With the drugs and the sex.  One last thing.  Encyclopedias.  The house that had the encyclopedias.  But then they would become dated so quickly that a few short years later, you know, borders  move and people take over power.  And you'd just read these encyclopedias.  But that was like your internet.  That's right.  Because the only information you were able to get at the drop of a hat was in your encyclopedias 
[01:47:30]  in your house.  You used to sit there and toil.  If you didn't know something and couldn't find it out in your house through some kind  of book or newspaper, you didn't know it.  Where this stuff is good is things like the internet.  Because if you lived in, you know, Oshkosh, Michigan or someplace, you weren't going to  get a cool book.  You weren't going to get Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.  You weren't going to get an Iggy Pop album.  Right.  You were going to get a Pat Boone album and whatever, and Encyclopedia Britannica.  That's it. 
[01:48:00]  You had to live on that.  Yeah.  You know, but now.  You throw on a leather jacket and leave town, you fucking, what's your problem?  Get off the farm.  You're going to stay in your house?  Get off the farm.  Louie, just great social commentary today.  Holy shit.  I love it.  You opened my eyes to a bunch of shit.  Quick break.  Donald Rumsfeld next.  Stay there.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  We got to go right to the phone.  Oh, my God.  Turn that music down.  And welcome Donald Rumsfeld to the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:48:30]  Sir.  Hello, sir.  Yes, indeed.  How are you?  Very good.  Very good.  What a pleasure to talk to you.  Donald Rumsfeld's new book, Known and Unknown, a memoir.  I've been looking through this fascinating stuff because, boy, you have been a part of history  in this country for many years, known many presidents.  Welcome to the show, Mr. Rumsfeld.  Well, thank you.  It's a little embarrassing to discover that I've lived one-third of the history of our country. 
[01:49:00]  One-third the history.  And been involved in a lot of things that have gone on through history.  Indeed.  Very important.  I want to mention that all the proceeds that I receive from the book are going to go to  the troops and their families.  Oh, that's nice.  I thought what you were going to mention was you know exactly where we live and to be nice.  Oh, we...  O.P.  It's not...  Where are you right now?  Are you just at home?  No, I'm in New York City. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, okay.  Last night I was on the Jon Stewart show.  Right.  There was a...  How did that go?  Because Jon is a little liberal, I would say.  Well, he comes at things from that direction, but he is very smart.  Very quick.  And it was a good discussion.  I was pleased to be there.  Yeah.  Have you ever been interviewed where you got upset with how it went and then actually did  anything to exact revenge on the person?  Never.  Why would he do that, Louis?  I don't know.  That's Louis C.K.  Because, you know, if you're a man of power, it's got to be an interesting thought at least. 
[01:50:00]  Well, no.  What you do is you think to yourself, what might I have done differently?  You've got to expect people to come at you because in our wonderful country, everyone  can have their own opinion.  And goodness knows, they can have intense opinions.  But I find that if they have intense opinions that are opposite to mine, there's an awful lot  of people who have intense opinions that are very much like mine.  Now, you have been in front of a lot of the press over the years, and you've learned how 
[01:50:30]  to kind of deflect certain questions and handle the press.  So I guess interviews are pretty easy for you?  Well, I enjoy it.  I think it's important that people, you know, put their views out there so that we have a  competition of ideas and the American people can sift through it and make their own judgments.  Yeah, absolutely.  When did you first get inside?  And by inside, I mean, you know, the kind of inner circle of power in the government, especially 
[01:51:00]  during the Cold War.  When did you just go from a military guy into becoming kind of an enigma, kind of a person  of power and on the inside?  How did that happen?  Well, you know, I don't have any idea.  I was a Navy pilot, and I knocked on doors, got a job working for a congressman in Washington,  and I'd never met a congressman.  And then I ran for Congress and served during the Kennedy and Johnson era. 
[01:51:30]  And then I was in Nixon's cabinet and Ford's cabinet and worked for Reagan as a special  envoy of the Middle East, and then George W. Bush's cabinet.  It just kind of all happened over the decades, and suddenly I'm 78 years old.  But so haven't you, like, how much, how does it feel to have, you've probably accumulated  a lot of things that you know that you'll never tell anybody on the planet Earth, right?  Well, you know, not really.  I'm interested in history. 
[01:52:00]  I love to read biographies, which is one of the reasons I took four years and wrote the  book and tried to discuss what it was like being inside and how the decisions are made  and how complicated they are when they reach the senior levels of government.  I also created a website, rumsfeld.com, where we've put hundreds of documents, thousands  of pages, from throughout my life so that people can read them and check things in the  book.  For example, if I quote a paragraph off a memo in the book, you can go to the website 
[01:52:30]  and read the whole memo.  Oh, okay.  But you must have lived moments where you were like, holy cow, no one but me and these two  people are ever going to know this happened.  And it had a massive impact on history.  Well, there certainly are times like that.  But over time, almost everything comes out and there are moments when what's going on  inside the White House is very sensitive and very private.  But within any reasonable period of time, much of what goes on becomes public and the American 
[01:53:00]  people look at it.  Yeah.  Do you look at, how do you see your legacy based on your career with George W. Bush?  Do you see yourself as a fall guy?  Do you see yourself as somebody looked upon as evil?  And do you think it affects what you've done before that? 
[01:53:30]  Because I see you as a very patriotic guy that served his country well and still does.  But some people, based especially on your experience with George W. Bush, see you as an evil guy.  How do you accept that?  Well, you know, I know who I am.  I know what I've done.  And one of the reasons I wrote the book was to try to get out there what the arguments pro and con were 
[01:54:00]  so people can look at them.  And I've taken on tough jobs.  I've had to make tough decisions.  And when you do that, you can expect people are going to disagree strongly.  It doesn't come as a great surprise to me, I suppose, having lived so many decades.  Were you disappointed, though, with the way your career ended with George W. Bush's administration?  No, I think he made the right decision and I made the right decision.  I think once one of the houses of Congress went to the other party, the next two years 
[01:54:30]  would have been hearings and, you know, people would have tried to go after the Bush administration  through me.  And I decided it would be better for the military, better for the Pentagon, better for the president  and the administration if I left.  And the president and I were very much in agreement.  But doesn't that kind of leave you hanging out to dry, is what I'm saying, and looking  bad, like you did something very wrong?  No, I don't feel that way.  And I don't think history will suggest that.  And I don't think that serious people interested in what went on, who go to the website and read 
[01:55:00]  the book carefully, will feel that way.  These are complicated issues, and we took on tough jobs.  We spent every waking moment trying to protect the American people, and we put in place  some structures that, lo and behold, almost a decade later, there's not been another successful  attack on America.  Now, that's worth something.  And I think...  I agree with you.  And the book, Known and Unknown, a memoir by Donald Rumsfeld, it's out there. 
[01:55:30]  And does this kind of open up who you are as a person?  Because I don't think people really know you as a person.  They see you and have seen you at press conferences and whatnot, and kind of see you as, I don't  know, a very mysterious guy.  And that kind of scares people.  Well, I don't feel mysterious.  I think what you see is what you get.  And I think that the book, it does open up my life, my family life, my circumstance, 
[01:56:00]  where I came from, from a small town in Illinois, and went to college on a scholarship, and was  a wrestler, and a person who loves the country, and is so grateful to have had so many opportunities  to serve.  It's interesting, though, because there are people who think, I mean, here's a guy who  met Eisenhower as a congressman, right?  I was running for Congress, exactly.  And, you know, worked for Ford, and Nixon, and Reagan, and both Bushes. 
[01:56:30]  And there's still those people out there that think, you know, Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney  are actually lizards, who, I mean, literally, there's people that think they're lizards from  outer space.  Yeah, that's true.  Who eat human flesh.  I don't know if anybody's ever asked you directly, sir, but are you a lizard?  He's, I don't think, are you, actually, can you just please give that a straight answer?  Are you a lizard person?  Louie's a little left-leaning, sir. 
[01:57:00]  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  Let him answer, are you a lizard?  Here's the short answer.  I'm in New York City.  I walk down the street.  People walk up, shake hands, stop me.  They want an autograph.  He's a lizard.  I want to get a photograph with me.  Go to eat last night at dinner, and Joyce and I were sitting there in the little Italian  restaurant, and a man came up and said he'd like to buy my dinner.  And it turns out I paid for my dinner.  The next thing I know, the waiter comes back and said, the man insisted to pay for your  dinner, and here's your canceled receipt for me. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, wow.  That's very nice.  See, there's plenty of people that...  You didn't answer the question.  He's not going to dignify...  I think you're hanging around with the wrong people.  He's not going to dignify an answer to, are you a lizard, Louie?  Why not?  Because he's not a lizard.  What is the story about getting somebody paid for your dinner?  I would pay for a lizard's dinner.  I think I understood the fact that there are people out there that appreciate what he's  done as a leader.  There is plenty of evidence that this guy is a well-decorated and appreciated American, 
[01:58:00]  and he has more credibility than almost anybody.  Exactly.  But I just want to know if he's a lizard.  He's not a lizard.  Stop it.  I want to apologize, Mr. Rumsfeld.  Louie C.K. is a stand-up comedian, and I do not share his ideology one iota.  Matter of fact, we're meeting him for the first time.  We don't even really know him.  Yes.  So we apologize.  Exactly.  It's usually just me and Anthony.  Exactly.  But we said, what the hell, we'll try out this local comedy.  Mr. Rumsfeld, I want to ask you a little bit about the situation that's going on now  in the Middle East.  You are an envoy to the Middle East.  What do you see happening there? 
[01:58:30]  What's your take on the whole situation?  Well, I think what's happening is that we had good relations with many of the governments  in there, in that region, and it was contributing to a stable situation with respect to the generally  hostile attitude towards Israel, because an important country like Egypt had a peace treaty  with Israel, and that was a valuable thing that Sadat did and Mubarak stuck with.  The problem is that those countries did not move towards freer political systems and freer 
[01:59:00]  economic systems as rapidly as they should have, and the people are looking for opportunities.  Very large populations that are young, and they don't have jobs, and they don't see opportunities,  and they look around the world on television or Facebook or something, and they see other  countries where people are doing well, and they become dissatisfied.  So you have these kinds of turmoil and popular revolutions.  Now, the problem is that, take Lebanon, for example, there was a popular revolution. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, the Hamas wound up...  Hezbollah ended up taking over, and that's a terrorist organization, and repressive.  Right.  The same thing in Iran.  Now, isn't that a worry?  Like, especially when you have a revolution, as they did in Egypt, not a revolution, but,  you know, protest, whatever you want to call it.  The guy's gone.  Without having another guy to put in there, isn't there a worry, America, as to who's 
[02:00:00]  going to be there, and what kind of government's going to be in place?  Absolutely.  Everyone ought to be concerned.  Not just our country, but Europe and Israel and the neighboring countries.  The problem is that you can have a popular protest and revolution, and the winner is not the people  that are looking for greater opportunity.  The winner often is the most...  A minority group that is very disciplined, very well-organized, and very vicious. 
[02:00:30]  Listen...  Like Hezbollah in Lebanon.  And...  Or like the Ayatollahs in Iran.  Yeah.  So you could get the Muslim Brotherhood...  Oh, that doesn't sound good.  ...and the radical extremists...  Exactly.  ...over Egypt, which would be terribly dangerous.  Absolutely.  Listen, and these are great questions, Anthony, and they're questions that Mr. Rumsfeld is  going to answer better than almost anybody in the world.  Yeah.  But they...  But I still want to know if he's a lizard.  And if he is...  Stop it! 
[02:01:00]  If he's tasted human flesh.  No, stop!  I just want to know.  Mr. Rumsfeld, again, I want to apologize for Louis C.K.  He's a stand-up comedian.  He's playing at the Borgata.  Go to Borgata.com.  Look, if he's a lizard who has eaten people...  Don't encourage him.  It'll just make him worse.  And it has, Mr. Rumsfeld.  The second I get a denial, I'll stop asking.  Tell Louis that my grandchildren are listening.  See?  Well, listen, they have a right to know, too. 
[02:01:30]  No, he's not a lizard, and he's not tasted human flesh.  But here is...  He's answering.  That's easy for you to say.  I can answer, because I know...  The guy is a great American, a great patriot.  Yes, I totally agree with that.  He's done great things for this country, and...  Yes, Anthony.  Is he a lizard?  Is Dick Cheney a lizard?  No, they're not.  They are people.  Have they eaten any Mexican babies?  Have they eaten any human beings?  No, stop it.  Stop it.  I know.  Mr. Rumsfeld, I apologize.  Louis C.K. is...  I paid for this microphone, mister. 
[02:02:00]  He's trying to be funny.  I want to answer.  I don't understand it.  Where do you see the...  Why don't you let him answer?  Where do you see the 2012 elections going?  Do you see the Republicans taking the White House again?  And who do you see as maybe a good front-runner for the Republicans?  You know, I don't think there is one.  I think it's one of those rare times when there's not an incumbent president running, and there's  not a vice president running, and there's not an obvious person.  And I think what we ought to do is watch them run around the track a while and see how  they handle things.  It's a tough job. 
[02:02:30]  As President Obama is finding out, it's a lot easier to campaign.  Exactly.  And so I think we ought to watch all these candidates.  There are some terrific ones running, and I think some of them have executive experience.  Some of them have a lot of legislative experience.  And see how they handle...  Because what's going to happen is they're going to get asked tough questions.  They're going to get put in difficult positions.  And we're going to then be able to see how their brains work, how they react, how they  handle things, what kind of people they recruit for their campaign team, how effective 
[02:03:00]  they are in organizing.  And all of those are attributes that are helpful for a president.  Before the Lizard Council meets and decides who to appoint.  The Lizard Council doesn't appoint a president, and he's not part of the Lizard Council.  If they do, don't you want to know?  No.  Don't you at least want to give them a chance to say, no, I'm not a lizard?  I don't want to picture Donald Rumsfeld on the other end of this phone listening to  you asking lizard questions.  No, he's not.  Mr. Rumsfeld, again, with the 2012 elections. 
[02:03:30]  Wouldn't it be good to, and I always wonder why this doesn't happen sooner, to start really  grooming a good candidate now?  They always seem, the Republicans always seem to wait until the last minute to really kind  of get together and get a candidate there, a viable candidate that could take on a Democrat,  especially an incumbent.  Well, I think that's true of both political parties, if you think back to the Democratic 
[02:04:00]  primary that Mr. Obama won.  And I think the reason for that is there's no senior council of leading Democrats or leading  Republicans who can go into a smoke-filled room and start grooming somebody.  It's the American people and the parties, the people of each party that end up picking  these candidates.  But it does seem like it would be a lot more advantageous, especially for the party, if  they would kind of work together, instead of everybody trying to get their piece of the 
[02:04:30]  presidency, to just work together and get a candidate, a viable candidate to run that  would really have a shot at winning.  Well, and of course, a primary process can produce a mistake, and you could end up with  a candidate who's not very good.  Exactly.  And I don't think we want to see that.  I definitely don't want to see another four years of Barack Obama.  No, I know.  That's for sure.  Incumbents, you know, often get re-elected.  And I think the Republicans are going to have to be careful not to overreach and to manage 
[02:05:00]  their affairs in a way that are responsible and yet address what the American people really  care about.  And my goodness, this administration has served up a number of targets.  How anyone can think that the budget President Obama put forward is responsible is beyond  me.  The debt in this country is crushing, and it's going to damage this generation and future  generations and let people have the courage to step up and deal with it. 
[02:05:30]  What was it like when you met?  There's a picture of you shaking hands with Saddam Hussein.  Like, what was that day like?  The day you met that dude.  Oh, that famous picture.  The dude who later was hung in a badly lit room.  I tried to tell Louis that that was indeed during the time when he was an ally.  I'm just curious what that day was like.  Okay.  I'm just curious.  What was that like to meet that fellow?  Fair enough.  Well, I was in Baghdad at the request of President Reagan, and I kind of described this in my book.  I met the night before with Tariq Asis, the deputy prime minister, and then the next morning I was invited in to be with Saddam Hussein. 
[02:06:00]  And the reason that Secretary Shultz and President Reagan and I all agreed that it made sense was Saddam Hussein was in a war with Iran and had taken our embassy people hostage and was very hostile to the United States.  The United States did not have diplomatic relations with Iraq.  And the thought was that, you know, the old adage, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. 
[02:06:30]  Right.  How did we manage to get crossways with the two big countries in that region, both of them?  And yet they were hostile to each other.  Right.  So we felt that it was a good idea to see if we could reestablish relations, and that ultimately was done shortly after my visit.  Now, what was it like?  You walk in, there's a Middle Eastern despot.  Is he a good guy or a Democrat?  No.  He's a thug.  And he's in it fatigues, and he's got a pistol on his hip. 
[02:07:00]  And he's a tough guy and not a good guy.  On the other hand, people in Iran were worse.  And when you get up in the morning and look around the world, you know, there are not a lot of George Washingtons or Abraham Lincolns.  We have to deal with people who aren't perfect on occasion.  Exactly.  That's what I was trying to tell Louie.  So how many guys do you think you've met that died by hanging?  Oh, Jesus.  That's a good question.  Yeah, more than one.  More than one.  More than one.  I've never met anybody who, I met a girl who hung herself, but I've never met anybody who was sentenced to hang. 
[02:07:30]  He's had to deal with thugs during his career at some point.  Sure.  He's, you know, the world, and a lot of people judge things, I've noticed, Mr. Rumsfeld, a lot of people judge things based on what's going on now.  They don't take it in the context of the history and what was going on at the time.  Now, during the Cold War, I think we were willing, as Americans and the press, to accept a lot more covert action on the part of the government for our own safety than we are now. 
[02:08:00]  Do you think that's a better thing, that there's so much more information available now, or is it kind of a good thing for the government to have maybe a little bit of, a little more covertness in their actions?  Oh, I think you're right.  I think that we live in a world where there are relatively few countries that are like we are.  We have softballs.  We have free political systems, and that means that we have got to have intelligence-gathering activities if we're going to protect the American people. 
[02:08:30]  Exactly.  But what, like, American safety is, like, the biggest deal to us.  American defense.  We've got to keep the American people safe.  How many, but what if a whole lot of people in other places have to die in order for us to be safe?  Like, what if you found out that a lot of America was going to get hurt unless we just took France and just wiped it out?  Would you trade France?  Hypothetical.  Would you trade France for Texas and Arizona? 
[02:09:00]  Can you imagine if I answered that question?  Thank you.  Thank you.  But the news lead would be?  Exactly.  It would be like answering your earlier question, where I would deny that I'm something that you asked me.  Right.  He's not going to deny he's a lizard.  But he hasn't officially denied it.  What would be hurt by denying that you're a lizard?  I did not just arrive in town falling off a turnip.  There are no turnip carts in New York City.  Well, he didn't fall off of one. 
[02:09:30]  No, I totally understand.  But no, that's fascinating to me.  What would be hurt by denying that?  And I'm not going to ask you to deny it now.  I'm more interested in what would be hurt if you denied that you're a lizard.  He's justifying the question.  Sorry, I brought it up.  I apologize.  No.  But, I mean, we like to think that we're a comedy show, so we're just kind of asking a silly question there, Mr. Rumpstop.  But that is fascinating to me that saying, I am not a lizard, might be dangerous.  I want to know how it might hurt.  Wait, how would it hurt your credibility?  How did this happen? 
[02:10:00]  How did this happen?  There's a guy laughing in the background that is looking up our addresses now.  Mr. Rumsfeld, notice that Anthony Cumia is right behind you.  I love your book, Donald Rumsfeld, known and unknown memoir in bookstores now.  This thing really flying off the shelves, too.  I want to ask Mr. Rumsfeld his opinion on the unions right now.  That's a big topic out there.  Well, it is.  And what we've got is a government and administration that, according to the data, 
[02:10:30]  has fewer people who have ever been in business than any administration in modern history.  And what you've got is a lot of people who are lawyers and professional government people,  and they don't have the business background.  They have very close connections to the unions.  And I'm terribly worried about the way that our trade relations are going around the country.  We are – the president and the administration have been responding to pressure from the unions with respect to the trade deal with South Korea, 
[02:11:00]  the trade agreement with Colombia.  Here's Colombia, an important country in our hemisphere.  And we've been stiffing them.  And we're missing what's going on in the world.  In Asia, there are all kinds of trade agreements, and the United States is absent without leave.  We're not engaged in doing it.  And I think the answer is it's because of the unions.  And we're at a first point in our country's history where there are more union members who are government employees than there are who are in the private sector. 
[02:11:30]  That's a conflict, if you ask me.  Well, it's a worry.  Yeah.  And I think it's also not surprising, then, to note that the average pay of government employees is now higher than in the private sector.  That's not right.  And, of course, why is that not right?  Because it should be the other way around.  Well, of course, where –  Teachers are government employees, right?  And the jobs and the products and the opportunities are all in the private sector, not in government.  Right.  But a teacher is a public employee, right, is a unionized public employee. 
[02:12:00]  Yes.  So they should be paid well, right?  But it's not a matter of being paid well.  But they should have the power to get together and bargain for better pay and better benefits, right?  Well, if you look around at the school systems, they are in trouble.  And they're not providing the kind of education for kids.  And so the system isn't working perfectly.  My wife, Joyce, started the Chicago Foundation for Education because the Chicago school system was described as the worst school system in America some years – 25 years ago. 
[02:12:30]  Wow.  And that's – here's a great city, a wonderful city.  And it had a school system that the Secretary of Education labeled the worst.  Now, why is that?  It isn't because people are bad.  It's because the process isn't working.  There wasn't any choice.  People didn't have a choice.  They paid their taxes, and they had to go to school in their neighborhood, and they didn't have choice. 
[02:13:00]  I'm a Milton Friedman fan.  I think giving school vouchers so that people can – parents and kids can make those choices.  And pretty soon, the schools that nobody wants to choose have to disappear.  And the schools where people want to go succeed because they get a good education, they prosper.  Yeah, but American public schools used to be great, and now they're not.  So for years and years, they did well without vouchers and charter schools.  And then all of a sudden, money got taken out of those systems, and now they're suffering.  And then the people that took the money out point at the system and go, 
[02:13:30]  ha-ha, you suck because I took your money away.  So now we're going to – so what happened – why did they work before?  I don't think that's the case.  What you just said, I don't think that the reason the schools are not doing well today is because the money's not there.  I think that you look at the average price that we're paying per student or per school, and it's quite high.  It just isn't producing the kind of results that a more competitive system would.  How come it worked before, though?  When it was simpler, public – most people went to public schools, and you could just walk down to your public school and get a great education. 
[02:14:00]  Like, how come there's a decline when it was working without the competition?  I think probably it was a result of the fact that we were more of a rural country.  We had much more parental involvement.  There was more – smaller elements.  And then as we became more of an urbanized country, there was more distance between parents and the schools, 
[02:14:30]  more distance between government and the schools, and they just deteriorated.  And teaching the basics of what people need to know instead of a lot of political correct gibberish that are in the schools now.  I believe that, Louie.  Is teaching evolution that's what hurt the schools?  No, no, no, no.  I'm not saying that.  I just think that there's a lot going on in schools that has nothing to do with educating the students and preparing them for life.  I could be wrong, but I think there might have been one other thing.  You know, for years we had the draft, and we excluded people from the draft who were students, teachers, or married. 
[02:15:00]  And as a result, people who did not want to serve in the military kind of gravitated to getting married or becoming a teacher or becoming a student.  And so over time, you had a bifurcation of a generation, and that group is now just about retiring.  Because the all-volunteer military came in under the Nixon administration in the late 1960s and early 1970s. 
[02:15:30]  And so all of those people up to 1970 now, of course, would be 30, 40 years later.  So if they became teachers in the ages of 20, 25, 30, they'd now be retiring.  Did he answer the question about unions?  Are you for or against the unions, sir?  What do you mean?  I've got no problem with unions.  What I have a problem with is if unions end up exerting an undue influence in what's taking place in our country 
[02:16:00]  and stopping the United States of America from participating in free trade agreements around the world,  which are the kinds of things that help to create jobs.  Yeah, that's not a good thing.  But if the jobs are in other places and what – I mean, if the United States is getting to compete,  who is the United States at that point?  Is it General Electric and, you know, Walmart?  Or is it actual people who live in these places like Wisconsin who are asking to be able to sue for their own rights as a union? 
[02:16:30]  Well, you know, I –  Are you a lizard?  If the governor up there – I'm not knowledgeable about Wisconsin.  I'm from New Mexico, as the cover of my book shows.  No, you've got to pull a flea, son.  A handsome picture.  But my recollection is that the governor ran on a platform of doing exactly what he's doing,  addressing the fact that the state is bankrupt.  And how does he fix that?  Well, he can't fix it if the unions won't let him. 
[02:17:00]  And he's going to have to find a way to put that state on an upward path  rather than allowing it continue to go down, spending more than they take in.  Exactly.  And if the unions are going to try to prevent that, he has to do something about that.  I got an observation.  You sound just like Dr. Demento.  What?  Dr. Demento.  Someone's going to appreciate that out there.  Why, somebody –  The Funny Five.  The guy used to do the funny radio thing.  Yes.  You've got the exact same voice.  Well, he's got a very distinctive voice.  I know you could always tell Donald Rumsfeld when he was on TV. 
[02:17:30]  Right.  Even from the other room, you have a very strong, distinct voice.  I have a couple of questions.  Just out of curiosity, I want to ask you, Mr. Rumsfeld, what type of aircraft did you fly?  I was flying – the last plane I flew was an F-2F, which was a Grumman anti-submarine plane.  Oh, that's cool.  Did you have more capability to fly it because of your lizard reflexes?  Stop it.  I've got a thought for you.  Okay, good.  Folks are looking for a present for friends of yours. 
[02:18:00]  I spent eight days recording the unabridged version of my book, about eight hours a day.  And if you want to hear the voice –  And the voice, right.  What you do is you buy the unabridged version of the book, and then you can play it in your car when you're going to and from work, and I'll be right there with you.  I think you need that, Louie.  I'll be right there with you.  You absolutely do.  I want to ask you one more thing because I know you've got to go soon. 
[02:18:30]  I'm a very, very strong advocate of the Second Amendment.  I'm a lifetime member of the NRA.  Are you a member of the NRA?  I'm not sure if I am right now.  I have been, and I think I am.  And are you an avid shooter?  Because I am, and I love it.  I have guns.  I have rifles and shotguns and pistols and various locations, and I'm an elk hunter out in New Mexico.  So you're a strong advocate of the Second Amendment as I am, sir?  Have you ever shot a person? 
[02:19:00]  No.  No.  That's a great question.  I think everybody should be asked that.  No.  Have you ever shot some?  He was the Secretary of Defense.  He was in charge of everybody that America killed for a very long time.  Oh, stop it.  I've been shot at.  Does that count?  He's been shot at.  That's crazy.  I was my next President Ford when the bullet went right by his head and right by my head into the hotel in San Francisco.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  That was that crazy.  Were you ever shot at with any other, besides bullets, like plasma rays or anything else that are used? 
[02:19:30]  Space.  To take down.  Would you stop it, Louie?  My God.  Flesh-eating space lizards.  My God, man.  Who eat the poor?  Donald Rumsfeld, Known and Unknown, a memoir.  I suggest anybody that's interested in the history of this fine country and the history of a patriot and this fine man, go out and buy this book.  Thank you, Donald Rumsfeld.  Well, thank you so much.  Thank you.  Enjoy being with you.  I'm pretty sure you're a lizard.  Thanks, sir.  He's not a lizard.  Stop it.  Thank you, sir.  He ate people once.  You can select your partners carefully. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, I'm trying.  I'm trying, sir.  Come see me at the Porgata in Atlantic City on April 23rd.  It's almost sold out.  Just a local comic, sir, that we really don't know much about.  Yeah, I don't know him.  He'll be gone tomorrow.  Thank you, sir.  Donald Rumsfeld, everyone.  There he is.  Donald Rumsfeld.  Quick, hang up the phone.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  I can't believe you didn't let him answer.  Why would you not?  Because he wasn't ever going to answer.  Why not just at least hear his not answering? 
[02:20:30]  At least hear the silence of not answering.  He said I wouldn't answer that because it gives the...  I didn't get to hear because you kept talking with other questions over him not answering.  I'm not going to sit there and listen to the former Secretary of Defense try to defend that he's not a lizard.  Why?  Why wouldn't you?  Why?  Why wouldn't you want to live that moment?  Because, first of all, he's not a lizard.  Why do you want to be baby CNN instead of the only show that finally got the guy to say,  okay, look, I'm going to finally say something about this lizard shit. 
[02:21:00]  I'm tired of hearing it.  I'm not a lizard, per se.  No.  He said he wasn't going to dignify it.  He said if he said yes or no.  That could have been a recording, what we just...  He could have just...  It could have been a dude playing like those prank calls.  No, it was Donald Rumsfeld.  But the thing got interesting when we asked him if he was lizard.  It put a hitch in his giddy-up.  You know what?  He handled it like a gentleman and like a professional.  He handled it like a lizard who knows how to never answer. 
[02:21:30]  No, he said I'm not going to answer.  Did you hear at one point, and I wish you'd almost play it back, the first time I asked  it and he told that fucking psychotic story about some guy buying him dinner?  And then he said, you're messing with the wrong people.  He said that.  Go back and play it.  And then he bought me dinner.  You're messing with the wrong people.  And then I swear to God, he said it.  See...  Go find that and play it back.  But it was because he was saying how people do find him fine and a great person. 
[02:22:00]  So what does that mean?  Because...  I'm messing with the wrong people unless he's trying to tell me that I'm not going to make  it home tonight.  Maybe he was throwing a subliminal thing out like you threw a subliminal lizard out in  the middle of his discussion.  It was not subliminal.  It was quite direct.  And I paid him respect.  I said, you totally are this guy who's done these amazing things.  I just want to know if you and Dick Cheney are lizards.  No, and if you...  When you ask somebody...  If he ate human flesh, you asked him if he ate human flesh.  That is not a question for the Secretary of Defense. 
[02:22:30]  Well, I just...  Look, if...  Again...  If he has eaten human flesh, we better find out.  If he is a legend, we better know because he's coming back.  If he ate Mexican babies, you asked Donald Rumsfeld if he ate Mexican babies.  If I was in his position, I would be...  I'd be happy.  For the opportunity to equip myself on that.  Come on!  On that issue.  The guy doesn't have to...  What the fuck is it hurt a person to say, no, I am not a lizard. 
[02:23:00]  No, I haven't eaten a Mexican baby.  Because then somebody in the press can write, when asked if he was a lizard, Donald Rumsfeld  replied...  Told a story about the guy buying him dinner.  What the fuck kind of a denial is that?  It's not...  What the fuck kind of denial is that?  No one would buy dinner for a lizard in a restaurant.  I believe that he was saying he was answering you through a story.  I believe that the space lizard baby eaters who have...  He's not a space lizard. 
[02:23:30]  Who he and Dick Cheney are have some weird thing where they can't lie about it.  Listen.  Where if asked directly, they have to say yes.  Oh, you think that's a...  They can either not answer or they can't say...  Or they have to say yes.  If they do anything, tell a story about someone buying you dinner.  So you're saying that there's something ingrained in the lizardness that keeps him from saying...  From just saying no.  No.  Of course not.  They can't do that.  Can't do it as lizard head comes off and the red eyes come out.  In honor of Louis C.K., I just tweeted, answer the question, are you a lizard? 
[02:24:00]  Hashtag, are you a lizard?  Louis C.K. wants to know.  Pass it on.  I really want to know.  I can't wait.  I just want an answer.  And I really was fascinated that he said, can you imagine what would happen if I answered...  Exactly.  By the way...  Could you imagine?  I asked him if we could wipe out France to save Arizona and Texas, would we do it?  He's not going to answer.  Why wouldn't you answer that?  Why would you?  Because the answer...  As Donald Rumsfeld, why would you answer that? 
[02:24:30]  Because he may have...  If he can't answer the question, that means he's had to weigh that and he may have to  do it.  And he may have to do it.  The fact that he can't answer that on the same level playing as can't answer that he's  not a lizard means that they're both viable questions.  No, they are not!  Roland, do we survive?  I can't wait until Louis gets home and it's going to be dark and he'll unlock his door,  shut it, and someone will go, leave the light off, Louis.  Well, his guy asked me for a Louis email address.  Did he really? 
[02:25:00]  No.  Really, Donald Rumsfeld?  Leave the light off.  Let me say hi to Brian in Pennsylvania.  Brian?  That was Radio Gold.  That was a fantastic interview.  And do you realize that you had one of the major chess pieces in world history?  I mean, the last 10 years has influenced all of us as Americans.  Exactly.  No, absolutely.  You guys just interviewed.  And you know what was even classic was that you can tell how much Louis C.K.  is a fucking comedian.  This guy should not keep it straight. 
[02:25:30]  You couldn't do a straight question.  No, I couldn't stop laughing.  You know what?  I was laughing because I was a little scared to be saying it.  Like, I was laughing.  I was cracking up because Travis Teff, by the way, Travis, was popping up pictures of  Donald Rumsfeld at the podium with a big lizard head.  Like a suit, a tie, and a lizard head.  And I was laughing.  I couldn't look at the screen because I was laughing.  Look, you'll know Danny Ross sits in this seat.  It was a perfect interview because he's not going to answer really, really tough questions. 
[02:26:00]  So Louis kept it nice with the lizard thing.  I think it was fascinating to talk.  You certainly asked the Donald Rumsfeld.  I wanted to keep.  I like that I got a direct answer to how many people have you met that died by hanging.  Yeah, there were quite a few.  And he said more than one.  More than one.  Very casual.  That was more than one.  That was, hey, yeah, yeah.  Well, Saddam is a biggie.  Maybe Chemical Ali.  You might have met him at some point.  At one point, someone in the background was laughing. 
[02:26:30]  One of his people.  Oh, one of his people started laughing.  We got the lizard comment.  I got to hear it again.  You got that?  Oh, no.  Iraq.  Oh, no.  Here we go.  Yeah, play.  This is the answer with the dinner thing.  All right, play it until he says you mess with the wrong people.  I want to hear that context.  Go ahead.  The whole thing is a minute and a half.  All right.  That's fine.  Where are we going?  It's interesting, though, because there are people who think.  I mean, here's a guy who met Eisenhower as a congressman, right?  I was running for congress, exactly.  And, you know, worked for Ford and Nixon and Reagan and both Bushes. 
[02:27:00]  And there's still those people out there that think, you know, Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney are actually lizards.  I mean, literally, there's people that think they're lizards from outer space.  Yeah, that's true.  Who eat human flesh.  I don't know if anybody's ever asked you directly, sir, but are you a lizard?  Can you just please give that a straight answer? 
[02:27:30]  Are you a lizard person?  Louie's a little left-leaning, sir.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  I'm deflecting.  Let him answer, are you a lizard?  Here's the short answer.  I'm in New York City.  I walk down the street.  People walk up, shake hands, stop me.  They want an autograph.  They wouldn't do this.  Lizard.  Go to eat last night at dinner, and Joyce and I were sitting there in the little Italian restaurant.  And a man came up and said he'd like to buy my dinner, and it turns out I paid for my dinner.  The next thing I know, the waiter comes back and said, the man insisted to pay for your dinner, and here's your canceled receipt for me. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, wow.  That's very nice.  See, there's plenty of people that...  You didn't answer the question.  He's not going to dignify...  I think you're hanging around with the wrong people.  He's not going to dignify an answer to...  Stop it there.  Stop it there.  Did you hear that?  Yeah.  He was asked if he was a lizard from space who eats human flesh.  His answer was, the short answer is, I was walking to New York City last night and went to a little Italian restaurant.  Me and Joyce had a nice dinner. 
[02:28:30]  A fellow wanted to pay for our dinner.  Turns out we'd already paid for our dinner.  Next thing I know, the waiter gives us a canceled check, says, it's on the house.  I think you're messing with the wrong people.  That was his answer verbatim.  That was his answer verbatim.  I think he said, you're hanging around with the wrong people.  Play just that last quote again.  You didn't answer the question.  He's not going to dignify...  I think you're hanging around with the wrong people.  Well, even what the fuck does that even mean?  He meant that we shouldn't be hanging with you.  Oh, is that it? 
[02:29:00]  Yes.  You're so dead, Louie.  Somebody bought me dinner last night.  You're hanging around with the wrong people.  It's still bad for you, because he basically told us we shouldn't be hanging with you.  You're so dead, Louie.  Unless you want to be collateral damage.  You know what?  You know what I say?  Go see Louie C.K. at the Borgata.  I don't think he makes it to April 23rd.  April 23rd.  Come watch me be assassinated live, like Malcolm X.  Come watch a fucking Patsy, whose kid is in a cellar being beaten, shoot me in the fucking 
[02:29:30]  head in front of the Atlantic City fucking half-awake gamblers.  They're going to walk you through the kitchen, like Bobby.  In front of a bunch of comped Chinese guys.  Flew in on jets.  Your head's going to vaporize.  Yeah.  The point is still, lizard act.  See, there is why I asked him, because I hang with the wrong people.  The way I watch Rumsfeld is that when I saw him do those press conferences, I always thought  if somebody asked him something like that, are you a lizard that eats human flesh, he'd  go, ah, yes I am. 
[02:30:00]  Next question.  And it would be like, now we know, but who cares?  They have too much power for anybody to do anything.  He's an unelected official.  He's a dangerous man, and he never has been, he ran for Congress once, otherwise he's never  been fucking.  There's been dangerous people that have been elected.  Sure.  He's a great man.  Sure.  Donald Rumsfeld, great man.  That's what I say.  That's my take on him.  I mean, look at his fucking face.  He's a handsome man.  That is an easy mask to zip on and off.  Look at the back.  He's not zipping it. 
[02:30:30]  You think he's zipping it over his lizard head?  Yes, every few years, they update it so he ages.  They got a guy that they fucking took hostage from Lucas, you know, from the Lucas Ranch.  Industrial Lights and Magic?  Yeah.  When does he go back to being a lizard lizard?  What's that?  When does he just go back to being a lizard lizard?  He's probably fucking sitting there as a lizard talking to a shark.  Holy shit, really?  I am not going to get to that question.  He's sitting there as a lizard with his little fucking green legs crossed. 
[02:31:00]  Because he didn't have to be in public today.  That's right.  And his tail.  The guy laughing.  If you probably play it back, you'll hear a lizard.  He left.  The guy in the background.  Yeah, he's playing with his tail.  Whatever lizards do when they're twirling his tail on the phone.  Not even answering your question.  Yeah, I'm not going to answer that.  Get his phone.  He's not a lizard.  You are so good.  You're hanging around with the wrong people.  You're hanging around with the wrong people.  What kind of fucking answer was that? 
[02:31:30]  I don't understand it.  Here's a short answer.  It's almost like if you ask a computer a question that gets underneath its program, and it comes  back gibberish.  It doesn't know what it is.  Like, that's how to find out somebody's a robot.  You're talking to them, and all of a sudden you say to them, like, lemonade dog sauce.  And they go, five, six, seven, eight, nine, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve, twelve.  That's what that was like.  That's how Kirk used to get the hand drives all the time.  I'm telling you what happened.  I'm going to tell you what happened.  All right.  He is a lizard who presses these buttons to answer questions.  Like, he's got a bodysuit that goes on when he does press conferences that he runs ergonomically. 
[02:32:00]  Okay.  But when he's a lizard with his body off, he can't talk, so he just uses this button.  Oh, it's like a soundboard.  Like your fucking soundboard.  Like a sound machine or something.  Yeah, like...  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that kind of...  He's got a Rumsfeld loaded, one of those.  Okay.  And I said, are you a lizard?  And he went, oh, fuck.  And he fumbled, and he hit the tell the story about dinner button.  He told the story, that nice story button. 
[02:32:30]  Like when we hit the wrong effect sometimes.  He has a button.  He had that loaded for, like, have you enjoyed your time in New York?  Yeah, yeah.  So what have you been doing in New York?  Are you a lizard that eats flesh?  Oh, fuck.  Well, I went to a dinner.  I hit.  It was short of it.  I was...  And he's like, I can't just stop it now.  No, he has to listen.  I can't stop it.  I can't let it roll.  So, yeah, let the whole dinner story...  That's what happened.  I'm telling you.  Oh, fuck, Louie.  God damn, man. 
[02:33:00]  That was one for the ages right there.  He's not a lizard, I don't think.  Be careful.  If he is.  Be careful what you eat in the coming days there, Lou.  Yeah.  Oh, you're going to get some fucking ricin stuck in your side.  I'm going to only eat figs like Caesar Augustus.  Fucking lived on figs until his wife painted poison on him.  We should take a break, I guess.  Yeah, please.  Let's take a break.  And certainly getting props on the interview there.  Oh, it was a lot of fun talking to him.  Well, I had to be the straight man.  Someone had to keep him on the fucking phone. 
[02:33:30]  No, it is pretty artful how you were able to keep him on the phone after those questions.  Just blurt out another question.  And you heard me going like...  All I'm trying to think of is anything I can ask him.  Wasn't Reagan nice?  What kind of airplane did you fly?  Oh, Christ, man.  All right.  We got Duff McKagan.  He's going to check in next.  Oh, Duff is coming in?  Say hi to us.  It's been a while.  Good friend of the show.  He's not a lizard.  He can help you with stocks, too, Lou. 
[02:34:00]  All right.  Good.  I want to hear about other things.  All right.  Are you a lizard?  That's what we're asking.  Unanswered.  That's what we're asking on Twitter right now.  And it still remains unanswered.  Unanswered.  Unanswered.  Enjoy that hashtag.  Are you a lizard?  One word.  Opie and Anthony.  Louis C.K.  Bergada.  April 23rd, man.  What are you doing?  Get your tickets now.  You didn't answer the question.  He's not going to dignify.  I think you're hanging around with the wrong people.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  On the virus. 
[02:34:30]  Sirius XM.  Oh, fuck.  What a day.  Louis C.K. in studio.  Louis C.K. on Twitter.  And Louis playing the Bergada April 23rd.  Tickets are going to go fast, man.  And he's hoping to add a second show.  But it's not a guarantee yet.  So get your tickets for April 23rd.  Louis C.K.  Bergada Hotel.  We got Duff McKagan outside the studio.  Yeah, Duff.  Duff.  We should bring him in.  Yeah.  To join the program.  Certainly. 
[02:35:00]  Come on in, Duff.  What's he been up to?  There he is.  What's up, Duff?  Duff.  It's been a while.  It's cold over here.  We're in the new studio.  How you been, man?  Good.  How are you?  Good.  Good.  Doing all right.  It's Louis C.K.  Hi.  How are you?  Duff McKagan.  How are you doing?  Nice to meet you.  You too.  Nice to meet you.  Yeah.  Louis is a good guy.  We like Louis.  Yeah.  He's going to be dead soon, though.  No, no.  He'll soon.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Donald Rumsfeld is going to have him killed.  We're calling him.  It might not be a good day.  He's a lizard.  Yeah.  You missed it. 
[02:35:30]  You guys got one of the five interviews or something?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  We did real well, man.  I don't know how he got that done.  Louis was suggesting he was a lizard, man.  He had no business calling this radio show.  No.  None.  So I really don't know how he got that.  I don't know.  I think.  Was that Roland?  That actually bullshit?  Bullshit.  Because Imus is mad.  Imus does politics.  You know.  Imus didn't get.  Imus didn't get Rummy Bull.  What happened?  Opinion.  Anthony got him.  Yeah.  He's pissed off that we got him.  Uninvite him from my party. 
[02:36:00]  So who else got him?  Us and Jon Stewart.  Jon Stewart.  I think.  That's really it.  And then like the top whatever other guys.  And then like the news channels.  The View.  He was on The View.  Like A View and maybe a Fox type thing.  He got the ladies on The View.  He got probably two Fox News.  But we got to the bottom of it.  Louis C.K. almost had him answer the question.  Are you a lizard?  Are you eating human flesh?  Are you a lizard?  Yeah.  Almost.  Asked him.  Asked him repeatedly.  Did you?  And he refused to answer.  Yes or no.  Of course he refused.  And now we're worried about Louis' safety. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Because he has never answered.  Rumsfeld insider.  One of the inner circle guys.  You better stay up on this floor and not leave maybe.  No.  I'm not going to be alone for a while.  Yeah.  You are.  I'm not walking with you today.  You'll stay up on this floor until he mysteriously flies out a window.  Louis killed himself.  Man.  Weird.  He seemed so happy.  I saw him shot in the gymnasium at the Pentagon.  I saw him alone in a wheelchair.  I saw Louis in Times Square and someone poked him with an umbrella.  An umbrella.  Very strange. 
[02:37:00]  Because it's not even raining.  And his body was full of salt water.  Right.  And he was in the desert.  It was weird.  Yeah.  Very strange.  Very strange.  Very strange.  Tattoo that he didn't used to have.  Oh, well.  Whatever.  And then we'll go, oh, well.  He'll be missed.  His spleen is gone.  His spleen is gone.  And there's no sign of surgery.  No sign of surgery.  We found a scale next to him.  A couple of scales on his head.  A couple of scales and scratches.  Is this your guy's way of catching me up on the show?  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  No, I apologize.  I don't even worry about it. 
[02:37:30]  What's going on today?  What's Qaddafi doing and all that stuff?  He's still defiant, I guess you'd call it.  Oh, he's defiant.  Yes, he's defiant.  I think he's trying to kill as many of his people as he can.  Before he gets killed.  Yeah, he gets out.  It's like a stratego or something.  Yeah, what do you think about that whole thing?  The Middle East revolting in general.  You know, I guess my only comment, I have that column for the Seattle Weekly.  And I got an email from a girl, an American girl who's married to an Egyptian guy. 
[02:38:00]  So this was a couple weeks ago.  And they were in the square.  And the girl's from Seattle, but she lives there.  And her letter highlighted what a day-to-day life is like that and how much people make a day  and how much bread and gasoline is.  And she wasn't really commenting either way.  She was just, this is our reality.  We need to change.  And, you know, I played, my only experience really, I played in Israel and I played in Dubai. 
[02:38:30]  And I played in Dubai about three years ago at the Desert Rock Festival.  They're really trying to do like a rock festival.  And the kids, they come from Iraq, Iran, Egypt, India, and they're starved for rock and roll.  And kids, rock, kids are just kids.  And, you know, these are 20-something-year-olds.  And they want rock and they want to talk and they want to exchange ideas. 
[02:39:00]  And very, very eye-opening to see.  You know, I mean, traveling in a rock band, you see that people are just people wherever you go.  And the people aren't necessarily their government, you know, just like, you know, me touring.  I wasn't one of Bush's cronies, you know, when I...  I was.  I'm a free thinker.  And there's a lot of free thinkers around the world. 
[02:39:30]  So I guess these, I don't know.  You know, my take is that the young youth of those areas are just a little sick and tired of it.  Yeah, but you know what?  You throw the leaders out and then the youth isn't in charge of who gets put in next.  Well, no, that's the problem.  It's Donald Rumsfeld.  Rumsfeld will decide.  He's deciding right now.  No, he's cloning a pot of himself to go there now.  He's brewing up some sort of dictator stube over there.  His lizard friends will be in office over there. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, that's a good point.  Sorry to keep digressing, but when you asked him about the primaries and stuff, he said,  you can see how their brains work and you can study them.  He said that about learning about the candidates, you can see how their brains work.  He probably literally has seen their brains working and dissect them.  Open them up.  Yeah.  Sorry, Duff.  We're very...  It was just really fucked up to have that powerful a guy.  We've never had a guy like that on our show.  No offense to you and Louie and everybody else, but that's a powerful guy. 
[02:40:30]  Yeah.  He's had people killed.  Well, how...  Have you ever had people killed, Duff?  Naturally.  Naturally.  Of course.  Try.  Come on.  So how do I follow up Donald Rumsfeld?  It's not the best spot for you.  I'll be honest with you.  How about throw a curveball in there and ask you a couple of things about the stock market?  Stock market.  Yeah.  You invest a lot?  Are you bullish or bearish right about now?  Um... 
[02:41:00]  I'm kind of neither right now.  Yeah.  I mean, I take positions and I hold them.  Oh, you're a hold guy?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I think we talked about this before.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you're much more of a...  You're an active guy.  Yeah.  I'm not an hour-by-hour, buy-and-ticks kind of guy, but I'll hold for anywhere from a few days to a month.  You made a move yesterday, though.  Yeah, yeah.  I made a great move yesterday.  Why don't you tell Duff your move?  What's your move?  I bought some Apple call options right before it tanked. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, well...  Oops.  Yeah.  Oops.  I see it coming back, but...  You know, the market's been down a couple of days in a row here.  I buy gold coins.  Oh, you're a gold guy.  Gold coins.  Yeah.  I've seen Louis do this.  It's very fascinating.  The ones on TV?  You got some on you?  The ones on TV.  Do you carry Krugerrands with you?  I carry one gold coin for when the shit hits the fan.  When you get mugged?  At least you're...  Oh, for when the shit hits the fan!  So you can get a taxi or something. 
[02:42:00]  I've got one gold coin.  That is great.  I've got one ounce of gold on me at all times.  I shouldn't be telling this to people.  Right.  Why am I saying this?  I am always carrying an ounce of gold.  You really don't like your life.  If you hit me on the head, it's worth it.  Guaranteed at least $1,400.  I'm getting the impression...  It's a big elixir.  ...and I'm getting the impression Louis doesn't like his life.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, that's a Canadian gold.  Asking Rumsfeld if he's a lizard and carrying around gold coins, that means...  How about heavy gold?  I know some...  Heavy, right?  No, gold coins are nice.  Gold is nice and heavy. 
[02:42:30]  You slam it down.  Hey, man, give me a good farthing of whatever.  Farthing!  It's for real.  Give me a satchel of...  That bit is great, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  Payment, vague payment payments.  That's what made me start liking gold coins.  Yeah, well, that's a good thing to have, especially in this day and age.  That's right.  The world I come from, you know, it was so...  Especially in my 20s, it was so sort of insane.  And rock and roll is so up and down.  And there's enough chaos and rollercoaster-ness in rock and roll.  Yeah.  And, you know, I'm the last of eight kids. 
[02:43:00]  My parents grew up in the Depression.  And so I learned a lot.  I heard the stories.  I just heard the, you know, I just kind of learned the lessons.  And there's enough chaos in my life that I really found when I went back to school in  my 30s at business school that I was really, like, that rule of sevens for me.  Seven percent every seven years, you double your money.  That really stuck for me.  So I don't...  I'm really non-aggressive. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And I don't lose any sleep.  And I hold positions.  I held through the whole 2008.  Yeah, all that...  You know, when I...  When that tanked, yeah.  And everybody...  Put it all in, you know, take it all out and put it...  Just leave it.  I didn't do it.  Don't look at every statement like it's...  Now, your problem, Anthony, is that you're a blackjack player.  Yes.  And the problem with blackjack players, if you just sit there and win $25 every hand,  then you're going to be a millionaire if you're just patient.  That's great.  And when you lose, you're only going to lose $25. 
[02:44:00]  But which...  You start thinking that you're good at blackjack.  It's like casino.  If you win three hands, you think it's due to your eminence on Earth.  Right.  Of course.  So you go, fuck it, $10,000 hand.  I'm like...  I don't consider it winning $25.  I consider it losing $9,975.  That's right.  He's been known to do that, Doc.  Because he didn't bet that.  He's done some pretty crazy hands.  I've done crazy hands.  But you've done okay.  You're pretty smart about that answer.  I'm not...  You know what?  Here's what people don't understand. 
[02:44:30]  I think I was until last time out.  Wow.  By the way, go to the Borgata.  Enjoy the Anthony Cumia wing that they've installed there when you go see Louis C.K.  at the Borgata.  Wow.  No, it was a biggie.  How much did you lose?  Will you tell me?  I don't talk...  I'll tell you off the air.  Okay.  But I don't like talking figures on the air.  Because, you know...  I understand.  Right there.  Because the guy's like that.  Imagine if I answered that question. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, that to me...  To me, answering that is like him answering the lizard question.  Yes.  I just won't do it.  But, uh...  See, I don't think a lot of people understand.  Did Rumsfeld say anything like, uh, um...  What are you doing, Don?  Donald?  What do you call him, Don?  Mr. Rumsfeld, I was calling him.  Could have called him Mr. Secretary.  Are you...  Did you say anything like, are you pimping your book?  Is that where...  Was he pimping his book?  Is that what's going on?  No, I was...  He's trying to sell books.  I was saying that his book is fantastic, even though I have not read it yet.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But I looked at the pictures.  Oh, you did? 
[02:45:30]  Uh, yeah.  And I even read some of the words under the pictures.  Is there any, like, childhood pictures?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  His little egg.  They have a picture of him when he was just in his egg.  You know, when he was just an egg in the...  In the sands?  Yeah, in the sand.  Buried in the sand.  In the sands of Mars?  In the red sand of Mars when he was an egg.  No, there really is no childhood pictures.  When he was an egg in the sands of Mars 6,000 years ago.  6,000!  He should have put some pictures. 
[02:46:00]  He's got pictures?  It went up as a child, right?  You know, childhood pictures would have made it more endearing, right?  Yeah, when he was a teenager in Mesopotamia.  This is my, yeah, fashion faux pas when I was 16, you know?  Yeah, something like that.  You know, way back.  When the hell was he born?  How old is he?  He says 78, I think.  Yeah.  What are we promoting today?  What brings you to New York?  Well, I have, The Loaded has a record coming out.  Oh, right on. 
[02:46:30]  April 19th.  It's called The Taking.  We're making a movie.  Really?  It's pretty damn hilarious.  Right.  Our drummer gets kidnapped.  You're a figure, too.  And it all happens in one day.  And it's a madcap comedy.  Well, of course.  Of course.  But it's really, oh, thank you.  Coffee delivered.  Yeah, Starbucks.  You guys do it all day.  We're not happy with Starbucks.  This is real good.  He remembers when Starbucks literally was a local fucking moment.  Right, when it was a Pike Street, when it was a cool thing for a minute, right? 
[02:47:00]  You remember when there was one?  At the market.  Yeah, Pike Place Market.  And at the time, they had to compete with a bunch of other kids who had their own little  coffee kiosks.  There was more.  Those kiosks on the streets they used to have?  There was one.  There was the one under the monorail.  That's the original, yeah, sort of walk-up.  No, that wasn't before Starbucks, but there was just like a lot of little coffee.  I remember that.  We should ask Kim.  Are you from Seattle?  No, but I do stand-up, so I've played there a lot in my youth.  But we should, there's a couple of shitty comedy clubs there. 
[02:47:30]  We should ask Kim.  They were shitty.  You know, Giggles, I don't know if you ever.  I played Giggles, yeah.  Now, you know what it just turned into?  What?  Jiggles.  It's a strip club.  Really?  Giggles to Jiggles?  They just had to change a letter.  It was very inexpensive.  That's really sad about comedy.  I don't know why, because I think...  One letter away from a fucking strip club.  I think that place did pretty well with comedy.  Giggles was there for years, and I worked for one guy who owned it, and I came, I was  a young comic then, and I was headlining, and I did the first show. 
[02:48:00]  He had to work like Tuesday through Sunday then.  And so I did the Tuesday night show, and then Wednesday morning, he woke me up in my hotel  like at 6 a.m., and he says, how do you feel it went last night?  Wow.  And I said, I thought I did pretty good.  He goes, I didn't feel that the audience respected you at all.  Wow.  At 6 a.m. he did this.  Yeah.  And I said, what are you talking about?  And he goes, you don't wear a jacket.  You're on stage in a t-shirt.  What the fuck?  I want you to wear a jacket the rest of the week.  Wow.  And I said, I don't wear a jacket. 
[02:48:30]  I don't own one.  I'm certainly not traveling with one.  Yeah.  So why don't I take you to the store today, and you buy a jacket, and I'll take it out of  your check, and then your shows will go better.  And I said, let's...  A jacket is gonna...  He said that.  And I said, listen, I'm not gonna go to the store with you.  I'm not gonna buy a jacket.  So just tell me now if I gotta get on the plane and go home.  Because I'm not...  This whole line of questioning, I'm not doing this.  Yeah, it's just awful.  Either put up with me or send me home.  Yeah.  And he goes, all right.  You should've worn a jacket, but fine. 
[02:49:00]  What was the 6 a.m. thing about it?  How are you calling me at 6 a.m.?  That's when he wakes up.  He was obsessed.  Yeah.  In fact, he was up all night.  Fucking comic wasn't wearing a jacket.  Let's fast forward for Duff.  Wow.  Louie played Carnegie Hall recently in a black, shitty t-shirt.  Yeah.  So what did that guy know?  That's right.  Sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  Sorry to say shit, but I'm not...  Black t-shirt and jeans.  No, it was just a black t-shirt and jeans.  No one gave a shit because the guy was hilarious and got a standing ovation at the end.  Yeah, and that guy...  So what did that guy know with a stupid jacket?  His club's now jiggles.  That's right.  Look where he's at.  That's right. 
[02:49:30]  Right.  Well, he's probably looking at...  Duff, can we ask you something?  Yeah.  Because we were talking about this earlier now.  You remember when Starbucks was one store, we were talking about corporate America squeezing  everyone out, especially like a Starbucks is squeezing out all the local coffee guys.  Are you seeing that even in Seattle?  Is Starbucks...  No, the Northwest in general, like Seattle and Portland.  Have you seen Portlandia yet?  No, I haven't seen it.  You've heard about it.  Yeah.  What?  What kind of genius?  That's what I heard.  It's funny.  It's a show on like IFC.  And it's a... 
[02:50:00]  You have to see it.  It's a...  It kind of takes the piss out of the preciousness of like Portland and Seattle, but more Portland.  But no, there's still like little independent coffee roasters all over the place in Seattle.  In Seattle, Starbucks is looked at as sort of like, oh, really?  You went to Starbucks when you could have went to Stumptown or Zoka Coffee Roaster, you know?  So you guys are hanging in there because the rest of America is being taken over by  Starbucks.  That's the point where he was made of today.  But it's convenient. 
[02:50:30]  I mean, I don't really...  It's...  Starbucks is fine.  It is huge in corporate, yes.  But you can get it anywhere in the world.  And that's the problem, man.  Man.  That's it.  Yeah, well...  Man.  Right.  I'm kind of losing that edge, you know?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  But, you know, I mean...  Yeah, but do you only want to go to Starbucks?  I mean, wouldn't you like to...  No, no, no.  Wouldn't you like to think, man, when I used to go to Chicago, there's this one coffee place, 
[02:51:00]  you know, McG's, and they always had Ethiopian somewhere or other, but now it's just a Starbucks?  No, no, no, I will seek out...  There's a great little coffee place on 6th and 54th or 55th or something here in town  that I can...  There's a lot of good little coffee places, and I will seek it out.  Yeah, I seek it out, too.  If I'm up here...  But a lot of places, Starbucks kills those.  They kill them.  They predatorily kill them.  No, no, there is that.  They will strategically put their stores in places, of course. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, but I don't know where we're going with this.  Starbucks is taking...  I get, you know, when BP...  Yeah, we're doing the whole corporate thing.  That's where we're going.  When BP...  I mean, that kind of...  The BP and the sort of passing the buck thing happened in...  Now that I made some money on.  BP.  Yeah, I...  BP went down because, you know, little ducks were fucking... 
[02:52:00]  Ducks were being all coated in oil.  Well, by opportunity.  Well, by the way, I have a different view about that because a lot of people called it an oil spill.  That's what they were calling it.  Like, it's an oil spill.  They like to think that a corporation created toxic oil and poured it into the Gulf.  That's what people like to tell themselves.  That a Texas American corporation.  But oil is fucking dead pine trees and all kinds of...  It's just... 
[02:52:30]  It's a natural mineral that's beneath the earth that leaked out...  Right.  ...by a British corporation that was trying to get it.  Yes.  But it's...  It's the earth shitting in its own mouth.  It's not...  It's all natural.  And animals died.  And greed was the cause of it.  But it wasn't...  It's...  It's natural.  Yeah, it is a natural thing.  It's a bubbling...  It's like getting mad at a volcano in a way.  Ah, ah, lava.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A volcano.  It's like getting mad at a volcano. 
[02:53:00]  And you go, well, human beings made it the volcano erupt.  Well, human beings are just like animals.  We're just like...  We're just here fucking around.  No, we're like yeast that eats sugar and shits alcohol.  We eat oil and shit smoke.  I mean, it's just something that we do.  If you pulled back like an anthropologist or even just biologist, you'd say these bugs  burrow into the ground and sop up the oil.  Yeah.  It's like if beavers move into your area, the water goes up. 
[02:53:30]  The water goes up.  Nobody gets mad at...  Nobody calls the beavers fucking Republicans.  But here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  BP...  BP didn't shit in their own mouth.  They shit in the Gulf of Mexico's mouth.  Yeah, and by the way, it's the Gulf of Mexico.  Like, nobody even gives a shit how the Mexicans feel about it.  Like, it's a thing that America suffered for.  And Mexico's like, yeah, you know, we're not nuts about it either.  They're busy in a drug war right now.  Yeah, they're having a big drug war down there.  And I don't know.  But it's all, you know...  I just decided it was a great time to buy British Petroleum stock. 
[02:54:00]  And it went up.  It started going back up after they realized...  I bought it when it was still leaking.  And the second they capped that thing and did the test, and it's like, well, it's capped.  Ding, ding, ding.  It ticked up.  I sold out.  And I'm like, I'm counting my oily fucking Pelican money.  My oily, dead Pelican money.  It was fantastic.  No, and by the way, that's what people like to think, that it's all cleaned and it's been capped.  Go buy BP again. 
[02:54:30]  Of course, it's just as bad.  There's like wafting weird black jellyfish of oil now roaming the Gulf.  Yeah.  Yeah, just kind of...  Killing creatures.  Killing things.  Yeah.  I know a couple of my buddies are two of the guys on the Northwestern that deadliest catch crab boat.  And they say, even now, crabbing up in the Bering Sea...  They get Valdez oil that they run into.  Still.  Still.  Yeah, like a foot thick. 
[02:55:00]  Wow.  They'll pull up some pots and they're just coated.  Wow.  Yeah, it's still in there.  Makes them real tasty, though, the legs.  The crabs.  Oh, yeah.  That oil seeps in the crab legs.  Nice and moist.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Nothing better.  Wow.  Duff's like...  God bless those guys because those king crab legs are great.  They are.  They are.  Fantastic.  And then you watch the show and you're like, God, I really got to appreciate when I eat  these because people are literally dying.  Actually, what's his name?  One of the guys died. 
[02:55:30]  Justin Tennyson.  They found him in a hotel.  They found him in a hotel.  I hope that's not the guy you knew, Duff.  No.  Jared.  Oh.  Yeah, he was...  One of the guys, they found him in a hotel room.  A kid, yeah.  Which ship was...  Which one of the boats was he on?  He was on the Captain Phil's boat.  Yeah.  Was it Captain Phil's boat?  The...  Yeah.  I don't even remember.  Shit.  I had to get a second ago.  You know, that's all sort of close to home, all that stuff.  That was great.  Oh, I would imagine.  Yeah.  I don't like that.  So, Loda has a record coming out in April. 
[02:56:00]  We're going to play South by Southwest in a couple weeks down in Austin, which is a really  killer, great event.  And we have a new record company that's just completely excited about this.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I was just laughing.  Louis found out how much I lost and said I could have set up a scholarship fund that  would have lasted generations.  He could have done that with the money and lost in Atlantic City.  Wait, are you...  Generation.  Was that...  No, I wrote that.  No, he wrote it down.  Because I asked him to tell me how much he lost, and so he wrote it down for me. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, yeah.  He wrote it down for me.  And I could have affected an entire generation.  No, he would have had people, like, getting choked up when they said your name.  Yes, yes.  Because of what opportunities you created for them.  Instead of me spitting on the floor, walking away from the table.  Where, to me, is the big hole in all of your conservative politics.  Because I've heard you say...  I listen to the show all the time, you know?  When I'm shooting my show, we start working at 7 in the morning.  I'm always listening.  Turn on the show.  Yeah.  And I always hear you saying stuff about, like, if I have to pay more taxes, then 
[02:57:00]  I won't pay a worker to fix my house.  Right.  Like, if you don't let me have all my money, I won't help other Americans.  I can't hire people.  But it's such bullshit, because if your taxes go up, that's not what curtails your spending.  What curtails your spending is losing a shocking amount of money playing blackjack.  But that's part of my enjoyment.  And that's what most Americans, their taxes aren't their real burden.  It's their fucking own stupid, retarded spending.  Right.  And their wife is like, where's the heating? 
[02:57:30]  You know, should we pay the gardener now?  And they get a cold sweat.  Oh, fuck.  I bought...  I bought a fucking Stretch Armstrong for $6,000 on eBay.  But that's my decision with my money.  Yes.  Not the government's decision with my money.  Yes.  But you don't get to say that the government made you not pay a contractor by raising your  taxes.  They make me pay money.  You throw your money away.  Actually, me and Opie had to talk about this, and I want to set the record straight as far 
[02:58:00]  as this whole tax thing goes with me.  It's not even so much paying the taxes.  I understand it.  We eat it.  We all have to fucking do it.  Yeah.  And I'm not going to be like, oh my God, I can't do something because I'm overtaxed.  I despise watching anyone on the news and whatever saying that the rich, the wealthy,  where I fall into that category, aren't doing their part.  Well, who says that?  Every fucking Democrat and liberal is saying, well, the rich have to do their part. 
[02:58:30]  I've been doing my fucking part for years.  I've never heard that exact quote.  I've never heard that either.  Oh, please.  That's what you hear.  Please.  That's what you hear.  You're like, you know what you're like, and this is what conservatives are like, they're  like paranoid girlfriends.  Yeah.  Where if you say, I'm not crazy about how you said that.  Why did you just call me a cunt?  What?  I didn't call you a cunt.  No.  That is a direct...  I just asked you to treat me a little bit. 
[02:59:00]  There are direct quotes from people saying that the rich, the wealthy have to do their  part.  They're not doing their part.  They need to do more.  They're getting too many breaks, whatever.  And when I write a check to pay my taxes, I'm thinking...  Do you really sign the checks?  I'm thinking...  Yeah, I actually do.  Do you write them out and sign them, or are they pre-written?  I write them out.  Really?  It sucks.  Yes.  I write them out.  You don't have an accountant?  Yeah, but he doesn't write them out.  I just sign.  He just tells me how much... 
[02:59:30]  I don't even sign them.  He tells me how much...  I don't even sign them.  Really?  That's brilliant.  Until they rip you off.  That's why I'm a liberal.  You're going to be so fucked one day.  They're going to rip you off one day, though.  You're going to sign your own checks.  I know.  It's worth it.  It's been...  I've stored away enough years where he hasn't fucked me.  If Billy Joel could get fucked, Louis C.K.  can.  Dane's old brother fucked him over.  Billy Joel's what?  Brother-in-law?  Was it?  Yeah.  I've been with my guy since 90-something.  One day he's going to realize that he's not...  At this point, he kind of deserves it. 
[03:00:00]  You know, there was a guy...  If he takes my money, he kind of deserves it.  He floated me for many years.  There was like...  I remember one year where I was like,  can I...  Like, I got...  Come on.  I want to buy one of those.  And he was fighting me over something I wanted to buy.  Oh, wow.  Kind of politely blurted out,  you know, you haven't paid me in a year.  Oh, shit!  Like, I don't take money anymore.  Because you're barely alive.  The partners of the firm have told me to dump you several times.  Wow.  Good point.  Stop telling me you want to buy a fucking, you know, Rolex. 
[03:00:30]  When you haven't paid me.  We haven't taken our 2% in a year, you asshole.  So at this point, if he rips me off, he's got to come.  There are people that were with Bernie Madoff for like 17 years and longer.  Sure, 17 good years.  And 17 great years.  Yeah.  And then just got fucked.  That's right.  So, you know, I guess anybody is capable.  Would you take that deal?  17 amazing years.  17 good years and then fucked.  Amazing, amazing years.  It all depends on how old you are when that ends.  That's true.  When it starts.  If you're fucking 75, 80, fuck it.  You know what, it's a pretty good deal for the victims.  Because they're not much better off than he is in terms of... 
[03:01:00]  They fucking did the same dumb, corrupt thing.  They just...  Yeah.  Their crime is they didn't care or want to ask.  Right.  But he gets to be the lightning rod.  He goes to jail and they get to go, oh, and start again.  At least they get to start again and they're free.  Start over again, they're free.  Yeah.  But he goes to jail.  You got to think a lot of those guys kind of knew something wasn't right, right?  Something was up.  You got to think that.  Definitely.  Hey, I got one question for Duff.  One GNR question.  And I apologize ahead of time because I try not to ask you guys the GNR questions anymore.  Because Slash goes, oh, man, come on. 
[03:01:30]  But there is like a weird rumor.  Well, as long as you're still doing the Super Bowl and playing the one riff and then going  back down on the riser.  Slash had a good gig.  Then he needs to answer the question.  He did have a good gig at the Super Bowl.  Came up, played that one riff, and then back down to some quiet room with an intern.  Am I done?  He goes back under the field, and there's some bored-looking Texan kid there.  Can you imagine?  I think that's it on his headset.  Yeah, I think that's it.  You can go home. 
[03:02:00]  You're done.  Was that his accent?  Was that?  I don't know.  Yeah, that's it.  I think you're done.  You can go ahead and get back on the chopper.  Imagine the check he got for that, though.  Oh, yeah.  That was the easiest money anybody ever heard.  There is a rumor of a...  And also, by the way, it might not have been Slash.  I mean, he's got that hat.  And I'm not even saying that they fake Slash.  I mean, the Slash could have sent a...  Like, you want to do that for me?  Yeah, I'll give you $12,000.  Go do it for me.  There's no money in playing the Super Bowl.  Oh, really? 
[03:02:30]  No, no.  It's just an honor.  Yeah, they pay all expenses and whatnot.  Yeah, and it's sort of just like...  I didn't know that.  You promote your thing.  Your project.  Well, there is a rumor the NFL is trying to get you guys together, the actual Guns N' Roses  together.  To play the halftime next year.  The funniest thing was...  Is that a real...  I mean, you've heard that rumor by now, right?  Yeah, I heard it in my own house.  My wife comes to me.  She goes, honey, the NFL is trying to get you guys...  You know, they're getting you guys back together for next year. 
[03:03:00]  I said, Sue, it was a baby.  Really?  She goes, yeah, it's on the internet.  I'm like, honey, you're talking to me.  Hey, break away from the internet.  And get back to reality.  No, but it's right here on TMZ.  Yeah, exactly.  No, you don't know yet, because it's on...  You don't want to look at TMZ.  That's our culture, though.  It's hilarious.  She's living with the guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You have to break the...  Cut the thing.  Actually, turn your head away from the machine.  It's me.  Look at the person that you're talking about.  You can trust me.  You can trust me what I have to say about this. 
[03:03:30]  Fourteen years together, you know, we're good.  Wow.  So, no, it's just rumor and wild rumor.  I remember when Guns N' Roses broke, and I was in high school, and I was a senior.  And the kids, freshmen and sophomores, started listening to Guns N' Roses.  Guns N' Roses is the first band that I had the experience of saying, what are the young  kids listening to?  Oh, really?  A senior, but I was like, what is that?  Because I didn't know any...  But me and my friends were listening to Led Zeppelin, and Van Halen was where we were 
[03:04:00]  at.  And then freshmen and sophomores that had weird haircuts and were kind of fucked up, and  they were listening to this Guns N' Roses, and I was like, what the fuck is that?  Like, it was so different.  It was way above everything else.  It was so from the gut.  Like, you could hear every string of the fucking guitars.  It was such tightly wound, but I went nuts for it.  I loved it.  I still do.  Every time I hear it, I still go crazy.  Everybody was just freaked out.  I remember that, yeah.  It really is rare when...  Because rock and roll, especially by the 80s already, was such a fucking oversaturated... 
[03:04:30]  Every color of the spectrum is out there.  To have a sound that people go...  That shakes everybody, you know?  Yeah.  Rarely happens.  And it's weird to be, I mean, for me, you know, to be sort of, you know, to be inside  of the thing and not being able to experience it from anywhere else.  You're not getting to be a Guns N' Roses fan.  You didn't get to be a...  Yeah, I mean, you know, you don't get to be a fan.  Like, Slash, you know, at this, you know, it's so sort of iconic in some circles. 
[03:05:00]  Like, Slash's top hat could have come up on that pedestal, and people would have went  crazy, you know?  Yeah, exactly.  People would not even hand in it.  That's how big the deal is.  Just that.  So it went from us being, like, you know, kind of street urchins, really.  It was a band from the gutter, and Five Guys, that's all we had was this music, nothing  else, and it was that or kill somebody, really.  Yeah.  Well, it's like the Beatles coming out of Hamburg.  Like, that's what made them great, was playing the rough rooms. 
[03:05:30]  We have beer thrown at you.  Yeah, yeah.  You're wearing leather because it's actually protecting you.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, the thought that they were tough guys back when they were actually in Liverpool.  No, and the L.A. scene was such a, I mean, it was dangerous just because how strung out  everybody was.  Yeah.  It was like, it was hard to just survive.  Yeah.  And these guys found this, I don't know, you just tune into this frequency.  Yeah.  Play this one note.  I moved to Hollywood in September of 84, and there was the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles 
[03:06:00]  in 84.  September, the Olympics were over.  So I guess what happened was the cops had cleaned up Hollywood, pushed everybody out,  the hookers and the drugs and all that stuff.  And there must have been some events in Hollywood.  But I came right as the cops let down all the barriers.  Oh, and let everybody come back in.  And the floodgates were open.  And I had no idea.  I was 19 years old.  And it was just, it was just dangerous.  I didn't live in a high-risk neighborhood. 
[03:06:30]  I lived in like the, yeah, kind of the drags of Hollywood.  And it was, it was for real.  I mean, it was, it was on.  It was, it was dangerous.  There was ghetto birds over my apartment every night, helicopters.  Okay.  You know, there was a time where you, you drove down Sunset and you had this feeling  like, if I got out of my car, I could get killed and nobody will find me for a while.  Really?  That bad?  Yeah.  It was just seemed shitty and seedy.  And by the way, they came out of there and it became one of them playing in the Super 
[03:07:00]  Bowl for five seconds.  That only happened, again, going back to our fucking earlier conversation because of record  stores in the 80s.  Because some record store owner in Indianapolis said, this sounds fucking hot.  I think this will move if I put it out there.  And that's why he was able to come from the gutter up to mainstream was through that system.  It's like you're, it's, it's like a, it's like a septic system or something.  Yeah.  And now if you got to go directly from your playing it to iTunes, you have to go right 
[03:07:30]  to mainstream.  There's no coming up as much anymore.  I was living in Rochester and we got Appetite from some guy in Arizona.  It wasn't available yet.  People were just kind of trading it around.  You had to go find that shit.  I don't even know if it was a bootleg.  I'm not even sure.  That's why the reason it excited me was because I haven't heard this and I don't know where  these fucking kids got it.  It absolutely wasn't in my local record store.  Something that the kids at the time were just passing around.  Yeah.  The freshmen and sophomores in my school got it at the record store in Harvard Square.  And then they obviously changed the cover because you had controversy about the cover, 
[03:08:00]  right?  Yeah.  If I remember.  And then it, and then it was mass.  It was in every record store in America.  But at first when I discovered you guys, it was because some dude fucking mailed it to  us from Arizona.  Yeah.  That record was out for a good year before it hit.  Yeah.  And they were about to pull us off.  See, and that's because the record stores like Louisville.  Yeah.  Because the record had legs because it was given some time to seep out through the system.  And people went, what are those fucking kids that I'm a little afraid of listening  to?  Yeah.  I think I'm too old now, but Guns N' Roses and Nirvana, when I heard those two fucking 
[03:08:30]  bands for the first time, I was like, holy shit.  What is that?  What is going on?  And I haven't had that feeling since.  But then again, I'm getting older.  So maybe it's passed me by, but.  Yeah.  Well, there is.  I mean, I think there's sort of a disconnect now with younger bands coming up.  And I have a feeling something's going to happen.  But you're right.  There hasn't been that one band.  That wow moment.  Maybe there has been.  But it just, I just, you know, I'm in another world now. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, I haven't heard it about it.  But I can't really think of one off the top of my head that could have been, you know,  Guns N' Roses and Nirvana and then who was next after that?  Yeah.  Everyone's just still waiting for whatever Black Eyed Peas wants to do.  Like there isn't that kind of like Darwinist thing in the music right now where somebody  else comes around and goes, forget everything you've ever heard.  This is now.  Right.  Forget everything you've ever heard.  Except Madonna.  Right.  Did you guys hear that thing?  You probably did.  What is it?  Lady Antebellum, the song that they won the Grammy for? 
[03:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  I don't even know who that is.  I don't even know what that sounds like.  Do you know the song I'm talking about?  I heard the song on the Grammys.  Okay.  So Bob Rivers, he's a DJ.  Yeah, a Seattle guy.  Right.  He, the next day after the Grammys, he was driving to work to his DJ job.  He's a Seattle DJ now.  And he, he goes, I know this song.  I know.  This song is something else.  And it's a, um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, Alan Parsons. 
[03:10:00]  Alan Parsons project?  It's, and he, so he got to work and he put the two songs together.  It's, it's on the, on that internet.  Holy shit.  Um, and it's exactly the melody.  What Alan Parsons saw?  I don't know many songs by Alan Parsons.  He's great.  We got it.  We got it.  Has this come out?  Is it a big deal?  And it won a Grammy.  It won a Grammy.  I think, um, that's the lady and the Bellum. 
[03:10:30]  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God damn.  Lawsuit.  Hello.  Is that amazing?  I didn't even see that one coming.  And I don't know how I can do without. 
[03:11:00]  I just need you now.  And I don't need to see anymore to know that.  I can leave your mind.  Fuck.  I can leave your mind.  Oh, my God.  I can leave your mind.  Yeah, I certainly know that Alan Parsons song.  Wow.  What a big line.  Didn't even notice.  But the second that kicked in, it was so exact.  That's great. 
[03:11:30]  And, I mean, that's so much even better than George Her...  My Sweet Love and...  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  That's even more exact.  Well, the...  We were also talking about...  It's even the same fucking arrangement.  Right.  Lady Gaga doing Express Yourself.  It's that little...  Lady Gaga does Express Yourself.  It's fucking Madonna's song.  So what's going on there?  I don't know.  She...  Do you find...  Do we have one of those?  Is Alan Parsons Project Person going to get some cash for that?  I would assume that they're looking into it.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't want that going to front of a jury. 
[03:12:00]  No.  No.  Wow.  No.  Let's listen.  My mama told me when I was young.  Now, which one is this and who gives a shit?  Gaga.  No, check it out.  Gaga Madonna.  See, at least this is twisted a little bit.  He needs...  Yeah.  They want to hear it?  There's a part of it that's exact.  Yeah.  She pulled my hand with my lipstick on.  This is Gaga.  Nah.  That's the other one.  Bye. 
[03:12:30]  It's a...  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a twisted...  This guy didn't fucking do it right.  That other one's ridiculous.  That sucks.  That's amazing.  It's the exact same arrangement.  You heard the George Harrison one, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You would think you could rip off Alan Parsons, because who cares?  But that's one, you know, that's a popular one.  Yeah.  He's somewhere in Colorado like, what?  I heard...  Oh, that's a drag, man.  Can we get some cash for that?  That's a drag, man.  That's much better.  Okay.  Let's hear this one. 
[03:13:00]  Who are these people?  This is Lady Gaga and Madonna.  Someone might have just put it together wrong.  I was falling away.  The topic of mistakes.  I'm on the right.  I was on the way.  Don't lie, still very great.  Just love yourself, baby.  I'm on the right.  That's Gaga.  I was falling away.  Don't go for a second.  That's the baby.  Yeah, but you know who they're both ripping off?  Yeah.  It's Annie Lennox.  Would I lie to you, honey? 
[03:13:30]  Play that.  That does sound a little like that.  Would I lie to you?  That sounds a little like that.  Would I say something that...  Just play that quickly while it's still in our ears.  Why?  Because I can't.  Because it's going to show you a 30-second ad first.  Oh, Jesus.  Dumb ads.  Coming through!  Oh, man.  Now the ads are on there.  Stupid ads.  Dumb ads.  It's so...  Making the internet free.  It's interesting that the ads are for specific moments now.  Like, when you watch CNN or ABC News, and it's sponsored by Kellogg's, it's one thing.  But when you want to watch one moment, like, a man being beaten to death in Egypt. 
[03:14:00]  Sponsored by...  Target.  It's like, hey.  Yeah, Target.  Did you know the Geico?  And then a man being beaten to death in Egypt.  Doesn't seem to go.  Geico brought you this guy being beaten.  Thank you, Geico.  And aren't they funny?  And what do they even fucking do?  I don't even know what they're selling.  Let's see.  Hey, Frida.  Oh, there's a story video.  It's an old video of the story first. 
[03:14:30]  Remember these?  Duff had a story video or two in his career.  A couple of them.  Yeah.  What the hell?  Oh, we're really going through this whole deal?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  We're really going through this whole deal?  Annie Lennox is...  Oh, my God.  It's a minute in.  Finally.  Wow.  This took forever.  This better be good.  This is like...  I know.  I see you.  You're kind of over there.  Here we go.  Uh-huh. 
[03:15:00]  Any second.  Get to the chorus, please.  Are you sweating?  Isn't that a particular song?  I don't know what it is.  Yeah, middle of the road.  A little bit, right?  Yeah, a little bit.  My friends.  All right, so play a little Gaga.  Oh, wow.  Oh, my God.  Oh, Danny's fucking head is going to explode.  He's ready for this.  Don't you know how to use tabs?  No way to topic, no mistakes. 
[03:15:30]  I'm on the right.  Touch it, baby.  I'm on the way.  Would I lie to you?  Yeah.  Are you doing your own mashup?  Yeah.  That's right.  All right.  I'm not going to win any more.  I think it's tougher.  It's obviously tougher with pop music because there's not many directions you go.  There's only so many notes for pop music, right?  There's about 12.  About 12.  Oh, that's a lot.  Combinations of 12 are pretty high.  It's pretty infinite. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah.  Pretty infinite.  Pretty.  Pretty infinite.  Slightly infinite.  What is the universe?  It's pretty infinite.  It's pretty.  It's pretty infinite.  Wow, that Alan Parsons, though.  Holy shit.  I didn't hear that one yet.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey, so, okay, listen.  Yeah, let's go.  Joke for all ages here.  That's right.  You know why Tigger bounces on his tail?  Because he's a cunt.  No.  So he doesn't step on Pooh.  Uh-oh.  No.  That's not working? 
[03:16:30]  I don't think you're winning awards for that either.  Really?  I had some good jokes last time.  I was on here.  That one was not so good.  How come Louie was trying to do music and Duff's trying to do comedy?  No, check it out.  That really isn't working out well.  Two lesbian frogs are sitting on a lily pad.  Uh-huh.  I was telling it to Louie.  And the one lesbian frog looks at the other one and goes, you know what?  We really do taste like chicken.  This is my joke.  Louie's just nodding.  I can't respond to jokes usually.  That was kind of a respectful nod he gave me there. 
[03:17:00]  Louie, show him how.  I bet you're at work, so I don't get it.  I like your Kung Fu.  Louie, pick up a guitar and show him how that feels.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  I respect that very much.  Show him how that feels.  Yeah, you see how that felt?  That's this.  I'm just fucking done.  That's hysterical.  You know, music, hitting a chord that people remember is such a fucking powerful.  I was at the Knicks game last night with Chris Rock.  I don't want to brag on everybody.  Oh, you just did.  We were at the game and they're playing all this music, you know, all kinds of rock and  roll and stuff. 
[03:17:30]  And we were thinking about, like, I forget one of the songs.  What's the song you hear at the fucking...  Always Ozzy Osbourne.  Used to be Gary Glitter.  Crazy guy in trouble.  And then we were thinking, like, there's been comics who have written jokes that are as  good as some of these songs, but they fucking evaporate.  They don't...  You can't just climb over and over.  Nobody plays Steve Martin saying, excuse me, after a slam dunk.  That'd be good.  And excuse me was pretty phenomenal.  That could be good, though.  You might have started a trend today.  You know, they could do it after a foul called on a hometown guy.  Tell me about the game. 
[03:18:00]  I don't...  What happened?  That guy Carmelo was great.  I know all about that, yeah.  So, Melo was there playing.  He was great.  He was great.  Duff's a big sports fan.  They played the Bucs.  The Bucs, yeah.  And the game started and the Bucs looked really good because they've been playing together.  As a team.  Yeah.  And the Knicks had two new guys on the floor.  That guy Chauncey.  I don't know how you grew up black with a name, Chauncey.  But he fucking is so good.  He's a great player.  He was running the offense, and it's his new team.  Right.  And the thing I really liked about the Carmelo guy is that he played really smart and conscientiously. 
[03:18:30]  Like, he wasn't just a star throwing up hoops.  He looked like he was into the...  Like, he was crafty.  Like, the stuff you get to watch when you're there, that the camera's not there.  Like, watching him set up picks.  Watching him fool guys for the benefit of somebody else.  Like, doing fake, give me the ball stuff when the ball's nowhere near.  Or pretending a pass is coming.  Like, that's something that great players do.  Because when your defender's looking at you, and then you pretend, oh, here comes the ball. 
[03:19:00]  And then the guy turns around and you fucking dash.  He did such cool stuff.  Yeah.  He looked like a guy who hoped he was playing well.  He looked...  You know what I mean?  You look at a guy and it's like, he doesn't look cocky.  And then he just quietly scored fucking 29 points or whatever.  His first game in New York.  Something like that.  Knicks win?  They won.  Yeah, they did.  They were never behind.  I mean, the Bucs.  They're not...  You know, they should have beat them.  Bucs can beat anybody at any given time.  But Duff's not an NBA fan anymore.  Well, here's the deal.  I'm from Seattle.  And they lost their team.  Yeah, that sucks. 
[03:19:30]  Our team, yeah.  But I think the best...  You were talking about kind of sort of off of the camera play.  Yeah.  Remember Sam Perkins?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Three-point guy?  Yeah.  And he always looked like...  And I think he was baked the whole time on weed.  Yeah.  Those lazy eyes.  We called him Sleepy Sam.  Yeah.  Sleepy eyes.  I mean, the word was out.  Like, he smoked a lot of weed.  And it looked like he was high on, you know, court.  Yeah.  But he would just kind of meander.  Right.  But he was so crafty with it.  He would...  All of a sudden, he'd be there out, like, in the corner for a three-pointer. 
[03:20:00]  And just a great guy to watch, like, sitting there in the audience.  Yeah, just...  I like earnest players.  Yeah.  How did Seattle lose their team?  How do you allow that to happen?  It was not unlike the Cleveland Browns thing.  Right.  From back in the day.  Yeah.  It was horrible.  Was it the middle of the night type of thing?  I think some teams...  Like, you know, Green Bay still has Lambeau Field.  And they're still operating the same way they always did.  I mean, whenever you start buying massive stadiums and needing a bigger and bigger profit margin to stay alive, it's easy to tumble. 
[03:20:30]  Like, teams that have stayed in weird towns, like Portland or whatever, it's because they just sort of just keep doing the same thing.  When they start overgrowing, I think, is when it's like...  Why was it criminal for the Seattle Super Bowl?  Well, okay.  So, Howard Schultz, the CEO of...  By the way, we're going to acknowledge you do have to go, but I just want to hear this answer, and then we'll get you out of it.  Okay.  So, Howard Schultz on the team.  He's CEO of Starbucks. 
[03:21:00]  I think he had some whatever health problems, and he...  It was too much of a burden for him to have the Sonics.  So, Clay Bennett, who, when there was the hurricane in New Orleans, New Orleans went up to Oklahoma City and played during that half of the season, remember that?  Yeah, yeah.  Clay Bennett was sort of this guy, this mover and shaker in Oklahoma City's Stearns, like, best friend.  So, all of a sudden, Clay Bennett's up.  I'll buy the Sonics. 
[03:21:30]  Well, there was a, you know, thing in the contract that he could move the team.  Howard Schultz had in place.  You can't move the team if you're going to buy...  You can buy, but you can't move.  Yeah.  And he bought the team and moved them.  So, there was, you know, lawsuits and all that stuff, but, you know, of course, the fans, we don't care about skyboxes and luxury suites.  We just want our team, you know, and it was really pretty sad.  That's pretty sad.  Yeah, so it didn't matter.  It's like in Harvard Square.  There used to be a place called the Tasty Diner that was there since, like, the 40s, and the company that eventually sold the building to Abercrombie bought the building and said that we're going to tear down the Tasty and everything in it. 
[03:22:00]  And so, everybody started defending the Tasty, and it was a big movement, and somebody found out that George Washington had an office in the building.  Oh, shit.  And so, they said, so it got put on the National Register.  You can't tear this down because it was a historic building, and everybody celebrated.  And so, the company that was going to, that bought the building, you know, figured out, what happens when you tear down a building? 
[03:22:30]  Oh.  They don't, you don't go to jail.  You don't go to the electric chair.  Oh, right.  You get fined, what, a fucking, what, $200,000?  That's a great idea.  You know, half what you fucking probably, theoretically lost in a blackjack table?  Fuck it.  Fuck George Washington is the, uh...  Fuck it.  It's what I just learned.  So then they just go, fuck it.  Just pay it.  Holy shit.  Tear it down, pay the fine.  Wow.  And by the way, the building is no longer national. 
[03:23:00]  It ain't anymore.  Yeah.  And they ripped it down.  They ripped it down.  Yeah, so that's what that guy did.  He's like, it says I can't move the Seattle, out of Seattle.  Or else, what?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we'll be awful mad at you.  You nailed it.  Duff, you really gotta go.  They're begging us to take trade.  You're out of here.  I don't know.  You must have a busy schedule.  Fellas, thanks for having me on.  Loaded, the taking, comes out April 19th there in the United States.  And, uh, yeah.  And next time you're in New York, we want you to play.  The last time you played, it was awesome.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, this was good.  Trust me.  I liked it. 
[03:23:30]  But we'd like to, you know, see you play a little bit.  My jokes, I should have brought a little stronger jokes.  No, you were fine.  Are you gonna think about it?  You were in Guns N' Roses.  Don't worry about it.  You're fine.  No, you don't have to.  No, but it isn't my morning forte.  I'm just a shitty shock jock.  Don't worry about it.  You're fine.  No, you guys are great.  Your legacy is set, okay?  Okay.  No, Duff McKagan, good friend of the show.  Great to meet you.  Thanks for the music.  All right.  You're welcome.  Absolutely.  Thanks, Duff.  Always a pleasure.  That's a good one.  Might as well wrap up.  Louie, just an amazing appearance by Louie C.K.  He's gonna be at the Borgata, April 23rd.

Sirius XM.  The virus. 
[03:24:30]  The following sexually explicit CB radio transmission took place one evening in early 2010  between radio personalities Jim Norton and Anthony Cumia.  Neither party has been made aware of its existence until now.  I'm thinking about you.  Yeah.  Did you get the video I sent?  Yeah.  I really do want to be rough with you.  Wow.  Well, what do you want to do?  What are you going to do to wear me out?  I want to treat you rough.  Throw you around. 
[03:25:00]  Spank and slap you.  Slap your face.  Yeah.  Treat you like a dirty little whore.  Put my cock in your ass and then shove it down your throat.  I want you to bite me.  I want you to bite me.  Now you're talking?  Then I'm going to tell you to shut the fuck up while I slap your face and pull your hair  for making noise.  Wow.  I want you to beg for my cock.  Yeah.  Kiss you all over to convince me to let you have it in your mouth.  We will see how bad you want me. 
[03:25:30]  Whatever else turns you on.  Whatever I want, you are mine.  You please me like no other has or ever will.  I'm not losing that.  Great thing is we have a lifetime of this.  Okay, light out.  Good night, sexy. </pre>
