<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with the hosts’ characteristically crude and offensive humor, immediately launching into sexually explicit jokes and self-deprecating commentary about their controversial reputation.  The bulk of the early show focuses on a recap of the NFL games, with significant attention paid to the New York Jets' victory and Brett Favre's performance despite injuries.  The hosts’ commentary is heavily laced with vulgar descriptions of Favre's physique. They also discuss the Cowboys' poor performance, the Bills' ongoing losing streak, and a surprising win by the Browns, all delivered with their signature offensive style.

A caller then rings in seeking advice on whether he should let his 14-year-old daughter watch *Jackass 3D*, prompting a graphic discussion about showing children genitalia and a sexually suggestive anecdote from the hosts’ past movie-going experience.  Further calls cover Formula One racing (much to the hosts’ amusement), the New York City Marathon, and a Chilean miner's recent ordeal, the latter generating more crude jokes.  The show transitions to a review of the weekend box office, covering *Megamind*, *Due Date*, and Tyler Perry's *For Colored Girls*,  followed by a scathing and offensive critique of movie critic Ty Burr. Anthony then recounts a frustrating experience using public transport due to Long Island Rail Road disruptions during the marathon, leading to further vulgar anecdotes about his encounters with various commuters.  No guests are present in studio during this portion.

A caller, Sam, dominates a significant segment, recounting a bizarre and unsettling encounter with his landlord.  He details a strange dinner invitation, noting the landlord's odd behavior (repetitiveness, obsessive tidiness), the presence of firearms, and the landlord’s unsettling fixation on Sam's girlfriend, Jess, culminating in inappropriate touching of Jess's foot.  Sam describes the excessive amount of food prepared (chicken, carrots, potatoes) and expresses his discomfort throughout the ordeal.  The conversation then veers into explicit discussions of pornography websites, including detailed descriptions of specific videos and sexual preferences. The hosts also share their opinions on *Toy Story 3*, including a debate about a negative Rotten Tomatoes review and a discussion about their emotional responses to films.  The discussion returns to Sam’s story, with speculation about the landlord's motives and mental state and darkly humorous conjecture about what could have happened if the situation escalated.  The segment ends with more details of Sam's experience, including a photograph taken by the landlord, and concerns about his potential future actions. This segment continues with further details about the landlord's bizarre behavior,  extensive speculation on his motivations (including foot fetishes and cuckolding), and discussions about the possibility of hidden cameras.  The hosts and Sam explore methods of determining if their apartment was entered while they were absent.  The segment includes numerous sexually explicit and vulgar comments.  A caller, Chris from Alabama, shares a similar experience with a creepy landlord who rearranged his underwear. Another caller, Rachel from Long Island, recounts a terrifying encounter with her landlord’s disabled son who was found staring at her in bed.


Comedian Brian Regan joins the show in studio. The conversation shifts to Regan's career, his views on Twitter and political campaign ads, intertwined with further discussions about Sam and Jess's landlord situation and anecdotes about Greyhound bus travel. The segment ends with reminiscing about a past Opie and Anthony show segment involving a rat-eating contest.

The show continues with Brian Regan, beginning with a discussion about parenting styles, ranging from physical discipline to gentler methods.  The hosts then delve into a lengthy and profane discussion about Daylight Saving Time, speculating about its origins (eventually linking it to factory production and morale).  Regan shares anecdotes about his early career, including a failed attempt to make a semi-pro football team in Orlando where he received a helmet without a facemask, and compares being cut from the team to being fired. The hosts discuss the challenges of maintaining privacy in the digital age. Regan recounts stories of his early stand-up routines, including bad jokes and embarrassing outfits. The hosts play a clip from an old Opie and Anthony show featuring a human finger bone necklace.  The segment concludes with Regan discussing his oldest jokes, including one about Oprah and a black hole.  The focus throughout is Regan's early career struggles and embarrassing moments.

[00:26:30]  that one I like  a lot  what else is going  in Hollywood  I'm trying to think  I don't know  I wasn't prepared  this morning  Bubby  I just got up late  what do you want  me to tell you  I don't know  Hollywood  schmollywood  I say that all the time  is there any Oscar  buzz on any of these  films  who knows from Oscar  I don't know  what the buzz is  oh there's a new  Conan O'Brien  program starting  apparently  maybe they put  the minor on that  they have him be  the announcer  or something  they put him  in a big hole  he yells up  at Echoes  people go crazy  for that stuff  what about 
[00:27:00]  127 hours  that's got Oscar buzz  oh god  I don't know  what that means  127 hours  that's how long  I feel like  this conversation  is for me  it's endless  what's happening  that's the hiker  that was trapped  and had a fucking  saw off his own arm  there  oh I don't know  what I think  he was just  in a big hurry  oh here's your saw  what's your hurry  that's what I always say  why not cut the rock  new Michael Jackson  it's amazing  he's dead a year  and he's doing  he's like the  Tupac Shakur guy  Tupac 
[00:27:30]  Tupac Shakur  what is it with  these blacks  they die  and they keep  putting out records  oh my god  Irving Berlin died  we haven't heard  from him since  well  a person that  doesn't have a name  yet  we have the  new Michael Jackson  oh let's hear it  it's called  Breaking News  what's it called  don't bother me  I'm dead  boobie  that's a good name  for the Michael Jackson  record  how could Michael Jackson  song be called  Breaking News  he's dead  it's a commentary  on the media  maybe that was  the news  brand new 
[00:28:00]  Michael Jackson  this is an exclusive  you can find it  everywhere today  isn't this the way  it's just news  reporting of the way  Breaking Snooze  if you ask me  endless  how much filler 
[00:28:30]  does he have  what is he doing  a radio show  if I dance in this  I'm going to get  a heart attack  they got to put  a lot of music  in I guess  yeah there's  one line to it  are they even  using his voice  wait who is that 
[00:29:00]  there is controversy  that it's not  really him  but they're  insisting  that it is  that's not  his voice  it's not  Michael Jackson  sounds more  like Michael  Bolton's song  you know  exactly  you know  boobies  sound like  Michael  Bolton  that  that's not  Michael Jackson  that's the breaking  and he can sing  his own name  no  what is he a rapper  maybe it is 
[00:29:30]  this fucking stinks  it's horrible  no no  I don't think  that's him  I don't think  it's him  no  what are the fuck  what are they doing  how badly do they get money  what's the controversy  that someone else  might be singing this  yeah they're saying  when they first put out  the preview to this song 
[00:30:00]  they said they didn't  think it was him  so then they put out  the full song  Catherine Jackson  is insisting  that it's him  and he's singing about  things that happened  after Michael Jackson  died  yeah yeah exactly  Wade Phillips  shouldn't coach them  mine isn't true  this is horrible 
[00:30:30]  he might have done  like a part of the chorus  that's not him  no  this isn't Michael Jackson  I'm not sure  I think they're taking  pieces of stuff he did 
[00:31:00]  and adding it in  with other people  singing the fucking  other lines  turd  turd  turd  this is pathetic  right  thanks  we're not the less  than the rest of it  that's pathetic  that's sad  give some propofol  to Michael Jackson  his kids  don't think it's him 
[00:31:30]  really  it's not him  those little white kids  don't belong to  Michael Jackson  those Osmonds  do not belong  to Michael  his voice is in there  they got a few  from the archive  and just threw it  in the song  that's what it sounds like  his father's fist  hit the face  of Michael Jackson  lose your medical license  over  too much propofol  to Michael Jackson  try to say  there has come  all over your son's back  from Michael Jackson  right  fucking terrible  probably said 
[00:32:00]  that one line  on an answer machine  once  get a few  and throw it out  throw it in  you're in  he recorded the album  in 2007  in New Jersey  oh shut the fuck off  in New Jersey  one of the sopranos  or something  you know  he sings like a soprano  that's probably  what happened  in 2007  there was a  desperation  as far as  Michael Jackson goes  so why didn't he  put it out then  if he could have  made some money off it  yeah  he was always  such a perfectionist  shut up  he's no Tupac 
[00:32:30]  after Tupac  oh madam  Tupac rules  after his death  what  she's big tits  so what  she knows  I never noticed  she knows  oh my god  she can't say  someone's got big tits  anymore  someone's not coming to  anymore  I can say  Stevie's got no eyes  I can't say  she's got big tits  exactly  juicy  oh god  exactly  he's wondering  who's got tits  he doesn't even know  a girl is here  why is he sitting  there like that  what else is he 
[00:33:00]  going to do  hey you want a name  for that character  Jimmy  this guy's got  your name maybe  Mike in Pennsylvania  Mike  Mike  morning boys  hi  birthday Jimmy  Jimmy  I think that the  name of Irving  Heinz  Schmoyle  would fit that  character very well  Irving Heinz  Schmoyle  I don't know what  you're talking about  I think it has to be  something that's  Jewish  it's not  I don't know what  you mean sir  is that person 
[00:33:30]  still around  because we have  the weekend box office  I want to see  what  no probably  people just pop up  when they're there  that's what I was  asking  yeah you know  how it is  I mean  Megamind was the  number one movie  at the box office  even though that  movie Four Lions  is way better  but I guess Four Lions  wasn't in a lot of  theaters  right  Megamind did  47.7 million  all you gotta do  is put out one of  those fucking  little computer  animated things  and you're gold  you're gold  then due date  a lot of people  say it on  on the Twitter 
[00:34:00]  that it's  it's  it's a  it's a  it's a movie  it's okay  it's not great  it's not bad  it kind of just  sits there  that due date  and then for  colored girls  how did due date  do how much money  33 and a half  it's good  it's respectable  how did colored  girls do  colored girls  20.1 mil  big thick legs  full lips  is that what they  say in this movie  yeah in the trailer  oh really  yeah yeah  it's like  some kind of a  fucking  little thing  going on  Tyler Perry movie  yeah  it's another  Tyler Perry fortune 
[00:34:30]  maker  love this guy  this guy  cannot lose  does he do it  in Atlanta  or something  he does  whatever  he just  fucking does  whatever he wants  and makes a  shitload of money  for colored girls  yeah  here's the trailer  what's a Lionsgate  movie  another song  for singers  lyrics  no voices  unseen performances  Janet Jackson's  in this  ordinary 
[00:35:00]  brown braided  woman  with big legs  and full lips  become yourself  I got a real  dead love  in here  for you  now  I guess  this is goodbye  like you've  never seen  it before  a film by  Tyler Perry  motherfucker  realize  there was  someone called  a colored girl 
[00:35:30]  or an evil  woman  or a nag  I've been  trying not to  be that  my skin  is black  save your  sorry  I can see  aunt singing  this at karaoke  you can keep  yours  being colored  is a metaphysical  dilemma  I haven't  conquered yet  whoopee  I do  belong  and Felicia  Rashad  my skin 
[00:36:00]  is yellow  high yellow  oh we got  some Asians  my back  is strong  strong enough  to take  the pain  inflicted  again  yeah  I will never 
[00:36:30]  see this movie  doesn't look bad  at all though  oh stop it  really  I'd see this  it's getting bad  reviews  it's not as funny  as precious  I love the fact  that Tyler Perry  you don't know me  do  I love the fact  that Tyler Perry  doesn't stick one  token white person  in there  good  it's for colored  girls  that's good  it's not for  cracker guy  imagine if a white  person made a movie  like this  they'd have to  throw in the  fucking  the Asian  the fucking  of course  good for him 
[00:37:00]  geez  what kind of  reviews does the  35%  last good white  movie that was  made was  Birth of a Nation  and there were  a couple of  blacks in that  but look at the  fucking people  who are watching  82% like it  of the fans  right  yeah  well that's  you know  look who's  come on  but most of the  critics are probably  white  right  what are they  saying about it  critics white  audience black  but what are the  critics saying  I'm surprised the  critics trashed a  black movie  yeah  what are they  saying  look at these  dumb white  faces  fuck these  guys  wow there's 
[00:37:30]  just nothing  but white  faces next to  the squished  tomato  give us  everybody in the  theater holding  a soda  popcorn  yeah  and nachos  and twizzlers  they're hungry  yeah  yes exactly  god damn  anybody bust 
[00:38:00]  any caps into  the screen  I don't think  so  no at the  the magic  johnson movie  theaters  there were no  reports of that  no  okay  that's a chick flick  they're not shooting as much in theaters  no that's a  that's a  that was a few years ago  yeah that was  that was a while ago  yeah  they kind of calmed down on that  I wonder why  I've never been to a movie where a gunshot went off  I guess they um  been lucky that way  it's rare  what movie did happen  I don't know  it doesn't happen terribly often  I don't think  it was an epidemic 
[00:38:30]  yeah  I wouldn't say it's  strange that it hasn't happened  I think it was more a joke than anything  you know  is this Megamind worth seeing  no  no  is it a kid movie with the adult thing going on  is it cartoons  yeah  I fucking hate cartoons  you see Toy Story 3  no  fucking rolling rules  I never saw Toy Story  Toy Story 2  or Toy Story  I wouldn't see them  oh  they're good movies  very well written  and Toy Story 3  is an action flick  I loved it  fucking loved it  Roland got me the box set 
[00:39:00]  I don't even know if it's available yet  had four lines do  I mean will that be listed at all  I don't think so  no  very few theaters  because I mean the  the fifth place movie was Saw 3D  and that only made 8.2  so that means four lines  you know  maybe did a mil  well  a couple mil  can we check anywhere  is it listed  only a few theaters  well that's just amazing  because that really is a very good movie  but you know what  it could get picked  what movie  Sling Blade  was only in a couple theaters  but it'll never do well  mass appeal  look at this  81% positive reviews  on Rotten Tomatoes  82% positive reviews 
[00:39:30]  by the viewers  and no one's going to see this movie  what are some of the bad reviews  that's just how it is in America  unfortunately  let's see  you can't read the reviews  because they always have to use  ridiculous words  that are  either hard to pronounce  or you don't know the meaning of  real talk  didn't like  the jihad of the mind  may be close to plausibility  but protagonists in films  self-destruct  in jumpy  unnecessary close-up  the four-lying gang  merely staggers  from one pratfall to another  what a douchebag 
[00:40:00]  who is that fuck  he's a bore  he's a bore  he has to be different  that was happening  Seattle Times  he has to just be different  give me another one Jimmy  an ambitious  uneven new farce  that dares to mock  the motives and personalities  of four suicide bombers  who plan to attack  the London Marathon  that's a description  it's ambitious  and uneven  and that's why you pan it  right  Ty Burr  from the Boston Globe  a brazenly comic  fatally inconsistent romp 
[00:40:30]  that tries to destroy  radical fundamentalism  with ridicule  it does  it does destroy it  with ridicule  doesn't it  I would love to know  what Ty  what's his name  I would love to know  what he likes  in a movie  because none of these  have you noticed  not one of these  has said that  it's poorly acted  none of them  have said it's poorly acted  the jokes aren't good  the writing's great  less for politics  than his general bravado  there's not one  really good critic  the New York Post  the director  Chris Morris  has been successfully  making TV  for 20 years 
[00:41:00]  but he falters  in this  his first feature  he's taken  what might be  a funny sketch  and forced it  to run more than  an hour and a half  it's just  horseshit  it is horseshit  the Washington Post  didn't like it  the movie falters  with an inconsistent tone  these fucking faggots  these faggot critics  it's a really good movie  it's hilarious  it's really good  well done  let's see what he liked  whatever  yeah I want to know  what Ty Burr likes  we should guess  what does he like  I don't know 
[00:41:30]  you tell Ty Burr  I'm gunning for you  Ty Burr  Ty Burr  I hope Ty Burr  gets esophageal cancer  oh shit  Steven S. from Bayshore  wants to know  what did rotten bananas  give colored girls  oh Jesus  that's way unlawful  Steve  fucking piece of shit  Steve from Bayshore  is one of the worst  people ever  what did Ty like  he'll never be invited  to any of my parties  ever  it's true  what did Ty like  he liked machete  alright forget it  Ty stinks 
[00:42:00]  alright Ty Burr  please  you like the expendables  oh did he  what a cunt  what a fucking  pussy boy  Ty Burr  I hope Ty Burr  is injured somehow  he's horrible  hope he gets his foot  caught something  he gave a fresh review  to Dinner for Schmucks  he did  he liked it  that's all I need to know  2.5 out of 4  that's all I need to know  that movie was horse shit  does he like  for colored girls  I don't think he's reviewed  for colored girls  this guy sucks a dick  he liked Dinner with Schmucks 
[00:42:30]  or for Schmucks  he's alright to his opinion  but it's like  when you see what somebody  it's like  what are you doing  that movie just bothered me  and we all got free tickets  so when you go to a movie  where everyone got free tickets  usually like the crowd's  a little more energetic  and even in that movie theater  after they got their free tickets  no one was into it  snooze  because Kurt Loder  was mad at you  yeah then we almost got in a fight  with stupid Kurt Loder  why  because we got up  as soon as the credits hit  because we couldn't wait  to get the fuck out of there  and he was still doing 
[00:43:00]  I guess his review  and needed the credits  so he's pissed off  that we're walking past him  just google it  there's no reason  to sit through the credits ever  go to IMDB dummy  I love those people  that get mad at you  when you stand up  when the credits start rolling  stop already  unless there's some kind of outtakes  while the credits are rolling  there's no reason to see  a million fucking names  that you don't know  who cares what Kurt Loder thinks  no offense to the people  that work in the industry  but seriously  we're not sitting there  everybody wants to know  who the gaffer is  studying names  right  the best boy  right  best boy  yeah but Loder 
[00:43:30]  was really mad at us  please  I think we should see  for colored girls  as a show  E-Rock  E-Rock's reminding  I'm trying to be a nice guy today  but E-Rock just reminded me  and I might as well say it  that I purposely kicked his legs  on the way out  after you yelled  excuse me  really loud  there's ways of doing things  where you make it look like  it's an accident  I kicked his legs  probably broke his hip  I kicked his old man  his old man  legs 
[00:44:00]  Loder was old  when he was on MTV  I know  how old is this fucking guy  they goofed on him  that he was the old guy  on MTV  and it was back in the 80s  yeah  Christ  alright  should we take a break  yumping yimini  wow this guy  Charlie in Virginia  Charlie  yes sir  what's up  we were willing to give  I downloaded and burned  a copy of Four Lions  it's all over the internet  and four of us sat down  to watch it a Saturday night  and we all fell asleep  less than halfway through  were you stoned  no 
[00:44:30]  no  were you drinking  I wanted to give it a chance  were you bored  yes  I'm surprised  wow I love the dialogue  in that  yeah I love the movie  Jimmy loved the movie  and liked the movie  a lot of people like this movie  so  I'm surprised  if you didn't like it  that's fine  I'm just off  on a different point of view  what do you need  an Adam Sandler movie  to entertain you boys  yeah what kind of comedy  you're jerking each other off  you fucking homos  Four Lions is a good movie  what do you enjoy  you were all post  jerked off  yeah  all sleepy  the only one who stayed up

[00:45:30]  really good  Rob Schneider  no Corey Feldman  decided Lost Boys  wasn't good enough  to just leave  the way it was  and decided  he was gonna be  in Lost Boys  3  this is the third one  this is the third one  oh yes  well fuck me running  Lost Boys 3  now the jackass movie's funny  yeah that was funny  of course  they're doing fucking  wacky funny things  alright  Charles sorry  you didn't like  four lines  I don't know  what to tell you  we really like that  Daisy Chains  make you tired  we understand  yeah  take care  godless queer

[00:46:30]  just the one  just Corey Feldman  Lost why don't you  find yourself already  how long has this  guy been lost  yeah I found him  he's at Michael  Jackson's house  again  how much time  are you going to  spend there  Corey  goodness gracious  four lines  I thought it was  about a safari  I had no idea  who are these  men with the hats  I don't want to  see this  a bunch of  bombs running  around  boo hoo  I poo-pooed  that movie  we'll break 
[00:47:00]  wait a minute  did that go  right to DVD  fairly quickly  so did the second  one  wait Lost Boys  3 is already  out  on DVD  you can  you can own  it in your own  home  wow  but the second  one also was  fairly quickly  released to DVD  I would assume  he's holding a  machine gun in it  if I was Corey  Feldman I would  fucking swallow  a shotgun  no problem  I would have  no problem  doing that  if my name  was Corey  Feldman  no problem  what is he 
[00:47:30]  doing  he should have  jumped in the  last remaining  Corey  he should have  jumped in the  hole with  Michael Jackson  he's very  lonely  he's the last  Corey  apparently he's  been hurting  a lot too  over this  Michael Jackson  fiasco  I heard the  new song  who is it  I don't know  Helen Bergeron  here signing  off  Helen Bergeron  we'll see  what else  is going on  from the  weekend  after the  break  I will  tell you  this 
[00:48:00]  I took  public  transportation  squad car  Anthony  on public  transportation  when  Saturday  night  somebody  was drunk  no  no  no  somebody  was sober  and didn't  want to go  out  and then  drink  and drive  someone's a  faggot  I know 
[00:48:30]  my  older years  I'm starting  to get  really scared  of getting  a Dewey  I don't  want one  I've been  lucky  this long  at this age  get a Dewey  who cares  exactly  hit a family  fucking live  a little  the Deweys  are like  they suck  when you're  young man  when you can't  afford your car  insurance  and stuff  like that  and you  can do  10 years  in jail  and still  have most  of your  life  absolutely  at this age  gives a fuck  I don't know  a little too much  to lose 
[00:49:00]  I think  the thing  about the  public  transportation  after the  break  I'll let  you know  but the  little twist  on this  everybody  in New York  knows  which I  didn't know  at the time  Long Island  Railroad  was down  I know  and we should  talk about that  I know  you're not  a bit  we'll get  into it  because it's  infuriating  with this  fucking  piece of  shit  I want to  say the  city in  general  but it's  the MTA  right  or is the  Long Island  Railroad  different 
[00:49:30]  no it's  MTA  we'll get  into it  after the  break  wait to  hear what  they decided  to do  this past  weekend  oh yeah  we're rocking  with Zeppelin  Zepp 4  released 39  years ago  today  really  oh yeah  holy shit  39 years 
[00:50:00]  ago  it's a long  time ago  yeah this is  a ripoff  right  yeah we're  back already  I must have  ripped  I must have  ripped this  off from  some poor  black man  we decided  to do some  radio today  so  I don't know  if this is  a ripoff  I don't know  if this one  is  JFK  defeated  Nixon  50 years 
[00:50:30]  ago  today  yeah  then Oswald  defeated JFK  I certainly  did  whoopsie  yeah so  public transit  Anthony did a  little public  transit on  Saturday  yeah  and just  amazing what  they do to  the people  they had to  do some  upgrades on the  Long Island  Railroad  they have a  switching system  that goes back  to 1908 or  something like  that  when they had  steam trains  at Jamaica  station  but they keep  raising the 
[00:51:00]  fares  year after  year or  every other  year  but they  finally decided  to take some  of the money  from raising  the fares  and actually  updating the  system  but they  needed to  shut down  pretty much  most of the  service for  a couple  weekends  and they  did one  about three  or four  weeks ago  and the  second one  was this  past  yesterday  right  yeah this  whole weekend  the whole  weekend  I'm sorry  and the  problem is  the New York  City Marathon  was yesterday  so I'm not  sure if it  was the  mayor or  somebody  who asked  the Long  Island Railroad 
[00:51:30]  can't you  maybe put  this off  and do it  next weekend  because a lot  of people  really need  the Long  Island Railroad  this weekend  for the New  York City  Marathon  and the  dopes at  the Long  Island Railroad  said nope  we don't  give a shit  we need to  do this  yeah  inconvenience  inconveniencing  a million  fucking people  yeah  just a  ridiculous amount  of people  where they  had to get  on buses  and shit  because they  didn't have  service to  get into  the city  quickly for  the New  York City  Marathon  speaking of  buses  oh you had  to get on  a bus  oh dude  wow she must 
[00:52:00]  have been  really fucking  hot  no no  nothing to do  with that  I was  I just  decided I'm  going into  the city  to go see  and hang out  and sing a few  songs with my  brother  my brother was  playing a bar  in the city  here  and I'm like  hey you know  something I'm not  doing anything  it's Saturday  night  I'm going to  get out  going to  the city  and then I  start like  I'm thinking  I don't want  to fucking  drive  I just don't 
[00:52:30]  because I know  I'm going to  fucking drink  I don't want  to drive back  all fucked up  so  and here's  what you got  to do  when things  are working  perfectly  in order to  not drink  and drive  and get  into the city  I got to  take a cab  from my house  to the train  station  then take  you had no one  at your house  that could  drive you there  no  but all the  people that  hang out  tell someone  to give you  a fucking ride  exactly  I take a cab  from my house 
[00:53:00]  to the train  station  then take a train  into the city  and then take  either the subway  or a cab  to the bar  and then  like late at night  you got to  get out  like drunk  now I'm trying  to hail a cab  to get back  to Penn Station  to get on the train  to go back  to the train station  to grab a cab  to get back  to the house  it's just  being safe  is a pain  in the fucking ass  that's the problem  that is the problem  plus you got to deal  with crazy white guy  Long Island cabbie guy  yeah

[00:55:30]  and then  I buy a ticket  and then  after I buy my ticket  I'm informed by  a bunch of  Long Island Railroad people  that are in their  little reflective coats  that are helping people  ah yes  there's no train service  into Manhattan  ah  there's a bus  and he points to the bus  and I'm like  you know something  I could just  try to get another cab  and go home  and just sit around  or I could hop on the bus  have a little adventure  why don't you just take a cab  all the way in 
[00:56:00]  at that point  ah  I don't want to listen  to that fucking guy  yapping either  you throw money around  like it's nothing  ah  you know what  cause  cause  I don't get you  cause it  probably would have taken  just as long anyway  I guess  so I'm like  you know  I haven't been on a bus  since school  so I figured  you know what  little adventure  let me take a little adventure  so I hopped on the bus  way in the back  and ah  I was  the 
[00:56:30]  I think  one of three white people  on the bus  really  from your area  yeah  believe it or not  no  cause they were coming in  the train stopped  at Mineola  and that's where I was  at Mineola train station  were you on the wine dance line  Mineola  well they  they were bringing him in  from eastbound  them  them  so they stopped at Mineola  they all got off the train  and on my bus  that's fucked up  so I'm like  okay  and then driving to  then we had to drive the bus 
[00:57:00]  to Jamaica station  without taking any highways  they  he took Jericho Turnpike  and Jamaica Avenue  the whole way  why  I don't know  they don't take main roads  they  they just took  they took  Jericho Turnpike  lights  everything  it had to take you hours  to get into the city  it took me about an hour  and 45  to Jamaica station  no to get in  cause once I got to  Jamaica station  I took the E train  downtown  the E train  which 
[00:57:30]  hysterical also  I get on this thing  and in the middle  of the subway  there's  the seats  you know  against the windows  on either side  that whole area  is taken up by a group  of black ladies  and gentlemen  one  woman  was  so  fucking  fat  I mean  fucking  obese  fat  how fat  was she  she's  obese  fat  had those  long ass  black chicks 
[00:58:00]  seem to like  them fingernails  oh it's weapons  where they paint them up  and everything  earrings  that were  giant  giant big  gold star  earrings  and she's  eating  fried chicken  out of a  giant  like  bag  just  munching out  she's fat  she was  so  fucking  compacted  round fat  did her  fatness  bother you  it annoyed  every once in a while  you find somebody  where their fatness 
[00:58:30]  bothers you  and she's  eating chicken  out of a bag  yeah she did  I'm looking at a picture  right now  of a giant  fat  black woman  eating chicken  so she's  eating a chicken  next to her  is  what I could  only  describe as  a  thug  with these  Yankee hat  turned sideways  and shit  and  he's  eating  a McRib  they're just 
[00:59:00]  all  munching out  and across  the aisle  or across  the middle  of the subway  they were  all together  there was  this  skinny  sassy  black chick  that was just  saying shit  like  so I told her  I'm gonna  I'm gonna  cut you  I'm gonna  cut your face  and she gets up  and starts acting  it out  in the middle  of the train  how she's gonna  cut this bitch up  were you nervous  at all  no I got  fucking  Mr. 40 caliber  you weren't  I could give a shit  I'm like 
[00:59:30]  fuck it  I even took  an extra magazine  I'm like  fuck it  nine ain't enough  I'm taking another  nine with me  what in case  two baseball teams  were on  I thought he meant  to fucking  in case the  fucking Jamaica  Queens  against the  Hollis Queens  baseball team  that was it  I'm like  I don't care  you didn't tell us  that you were  gonna see  four colored  girls  this weekend  I saw that  fucking  E-train  yeah yo  acting it out  they were  acting it out  and uh  yeah it was  and fucking 
[01:00:00]  just loud  like everyone  else is just  kind of sitting  keeping to  themselves  everything they  were saying  was so  fucking like  loud  everyone on the  train had to  fucking hear it  it's their world  you're just  living in it  it exactly  you are  exactly right  exactly right  not Anthony  Ferguson  I was waiting  for a Colin  Ferguson  I'm the one  that protects  people  I know  I'm the catcher  in the rye  you'd be Colin  Ferguson  because you're  an asshole  the joke is 
[01:00:30]  he would be  more like a  Bernie Getz  Bernie  of course he  would  don't ask me  for money  motherfucker  except if he's  anything like  the call on  man cow show  he'd give him  the money  and the gun  and go oh  wait a minute  I messed up  turd  just so loud  but I was  soaking it all  in  that Jamaica  station  wow that's  some area  and driving  through to get  to Jamaica  station  on Jamaica  Avenue 
[01:01:00]  that's some  neighborhood  we used to  make jokes  when we had  to go all  the way out  to Huntington  on the Long Island  Railroad  they always  stopped at  Jamaica  station  and those  doors would  open  and you  would just  sit there  in a panic  waiting for  the doors  to close  again  come on  close  just close  close  because you  can get  to Penn  station  and get  on a  real safe  white  looking  train  all the way  out to  Long Island  of course  but they  have to  open those  doors  every  fucking  night  at  Jamaica  station  and man  was that  potluck  Jamaica  station  transfer 
[01:01:30]  bloody  bloody  bloody  you would  find yourself  you would  stop  breathing  yeah  and just  pray  for the  doors  to quickly  shut  again  I was  just  I was  just soaking  it all in  it was  it was  an interesting  little trip  into the city  it's good  to hobnob  with the people  and subway  it in  why didn't  you just  get a car  service  that's  because  why  what's wrong  with you  you know why  because I thought  the train  was coming  so I took  the cab  to the train  station  now I'm 
[01:02:00]  at the  train  station  I guess  I could  have called  a car  service  but by  the time  it gets  there  I just  hopped on  the bus  and I  thought  I figured  let me see  what this  is all  about  a little  adventure  and  I didn't  do it  going home  my brother  dropped me  off going  home  because I  would have  had to  take the  subway  to Jamaica  again  hop on  another bus  take that  to Mineola  get a cab  and get  that home  and this  is all  to avoid  you know 
[01:02:30]  because I  just had  a bad  feeling  about going  out  and having  some drinks  and driving  I was like  you know  something  I am not  doing that  tonight  I don't  know why  but  yeah  because dude  it's like  it could be  a DWI  but it could  also be  it's like  you forget  that you  could actually  have somebody  do something  that's their  fault  and you  hit them  and it's  like one of  those kind  of no  fault  or both  fault  and you've  had drinks  and you're  fucking doomed  or you kill  somebody  fuck that 
[01:03:00]  shit  texting  and driving  is way  worse than  drinking  and driving  way fucking  worse  drinking  and texting  and driving  oh my god  that's  you know  when you're  out on the  road  later at  night  you don't  know where  the drunks  are  every once  in a while  you see  one that  it's very  obvious  but man  when you're  out on the  road  in the middle  of the  afternoon  you see  the people  texting  and driving  they're all  over the  fucking  place  all over  the road  that's gotta  be way  worse  it's  amazing  all over  the road  I don't think  you should  drink and  drive  obviously  but I  think the  texting 
[01:03:30]  thing is  completely  out of  I will be  Mr. Legal  Eagle  doing the  speed limit  staying in  the right  lane  driving nice  not weaving  if I'm  trying to  read a text  and then you  look up and  realize you're  almost into  the wall  you do that  cutback real  quick  I've been  thinking of  that lately  as I'm  driving  how fucking  we discussed  it I'm like  I'm really  trying not to  do that  I'm gonna  hit somebody  every action  I've almost  had in the  last year 
[01:04:00]  or two years  I've been  texting  I made  the decision  when I  had the  kid  I'm done  with the  texting  and driving  and it's  driving me  fucking nuts  I hear my  phone going  off  I'm like  I gotta  check it  it's killing  me  it's like  I'm an  addict  I have  to do it  and I made  a little  pact that I  wouldn't do  it anymore  unless we're  going really  slow and  fucking  horrible  traffic  then I'll  pop it  in  they need  hands  free  something  that recites  your text  that's what 
[01:04:30]  they need  there's a  market for  that  is there  an app  I'm sure  there's  something  out there  I'm not  the first  one to  think of  this  but whenever  you get a  text  it should  be  you know  you got  a text  you press  a button  on your  steering wheel  or something  and it reads  your text  to you  unless somebody's  in the car  that you don't  want to hear  your text  that would  be awful  I'm going  to suck  your duck  wrong  backspace  so the  weekend was  good 
[01:05:00]  you guys  sang a few  songs  yes  had a few  laughs  had a few  pops  a few  laughs  hung out  and then  yesterday  was pretty  much  one of my  favorite things  to do  when I'm  alone  at the  house  I just  stay in  bed  and watch  television  all day  long  all day  long  I got  up  you know  get something  to eat  and then  right back  into bed  prop the  pillows up  just  watching  movies  and shit  not a  care in  the world  on a  sunday  have you  seen  toy story  3 yet

[01:12:00]  end of toy  story 3  could someone  tell me what  part i was  supposed to  cry at  i don't even  know  i don't know  you know  it almost had  such a sad  overtone for  the whole movie  and i knew  it was coming  and my wife  called me  and i'm looking  and i'm going  jesus christ  these kids  are gonna  leave me  any minute  and that  made me sad  i don't  where was i  supposed to  cry  you know  it just seemed  like the whole  thing i guess  maybe from  watching the  other movies  and watching  the kid  grow up  it just  seemed like  looking at  this kid  same kid  kind of thing  growing up  oh see 
[01:12:30]  your kid's  growing up  leaving the nest  yeah  i felt the  same way  at the end  of downfall  i was tearing  up a little  bit  honestly  did you ever  cry at  something weird  though  like  thank you  bobby  like a weird  thing that  probably you  didn't think  would make  you cry  but did  like what  you got an  example  lost used to  make me cry  all the time  like especially  the first season  i bawled  probably 50  episodes of  lost  don't forget  about ebert  ebert makes  you cry  that was one  time that was  very early  that was too  late now i'd  laugh at old  fucking slack  asshole jaw  travi what's 
[01:13:00]  up what makes  you cry  travis  nothing  really are you  one of those  guys  besides the  survivors in  schindler's list  had a picture of  your mother  i was just eating  my breakfast i  wanted to help  what are you  having field of  dreams will make  me cry to answer  your question  yeah that would  get me a little  bit though at the  end  that's because me  and my dad  baseball had a  catch  yeah  yeah  every time  that'll get  to me  now that i  mean  what's the

[01:14:00]  the wind or  something right  yeah i don't  know i i  like it  he was going to  college he didn't  need his stupid  toys gave him to  a little girl which  sets up toy story  4 obviously  right no  yeah i don't  think so this is  it yeah  why because it  ended on such  like everybody  loves this movie  it got you know  i love toy story  3 it was very  good i just  wasn't crying at  that scene no i  wasn't crying my  chick was crying  but you know  it was a good  scene did you  hit her yes  did you hit her  oh my god

[01:15:00]  movie it's not a  good movie yes  it is fucking  peter pumper  it sounds very  sad and i don't  want to see it  exactly it doesn't  sound sad  no the end is  99 positive reviews  on rotten tomatoes  so let's go back to  rotten tomatoes who  was the douchebag that  decided he hated  toy story  i say who  in 99 that  there were two  what an asshole  uh the first the  first like two  weeks that this  was out it got  a hundred percent  and then someone  had a yeah  what that's about  someone wanted to  stand out on  rotten tomatoes  and be different  it was just two

[01:19:00]  white you're a new york  press guy so so ron  tomatoes should just  kick him off because  he's obviously doing it  uh you know for himself  he's just one of those  guys right technically a  reviewer so they can't  really say no because  then they'd be limited  yeah but if the guy is  purposely doing that then  there's got to be  something they could do  he's just a jerk off he  is a jerk off one of  those guys  uh yes sam he also gave a  rotten review to the  social network which has  97 positive reviews he's  different guy yeah he's 
[01:19:30]  different guy what did  you like about social  network  we should get this asshole  on the phone i don't get  it  like one of those fake  smart middle brow tv shows  this  special spaciousness come on  dumbbell the social network  is disguised by topicality it's  it's really a movie  excusing hollywood  ruthlessness  what  i know  this guy doesn't like  anything  this guy's an idiot  he's crazy  watch out for him 
[01:20:00]  this guy's a tough review  oh boy  he marches to his own  beat  easy  easy a the uh teen comedy  oh it's easy a sorry  best line in show history  anthony when he goes  big a little c  remember they said  we showed videos of him  masturbating  tiny penis  it got 87 positive reviews  he gave it a rotten review  saying easy a is now  front runner for worst film  of 2010 
[01:20:30]  okay  yeah all right  he's a rebel is what he is  thank god for him  the town  don't get on his bed  here he comes  uh-oh  here comes a tough guy  the town after 94 positive  reviews he had to say the  town is nearly as ludicrous  as affleck's debut  gone baby gone  another poison pen letter  to bean town  first of all i liked  gone baby gone  i don't know if a lot of  people like that  i didn't love that  no i thought it was  terrible  i kind of liked it  that got 94% reviews  positive  no town  i hear the town 
[01:21:00]  here's a really good movie  and uh he did however  have good things to say  about resident evil  afterlife  which got 25%  on rotten tomatoes  they should kick him out  of rotten tomatoes  he's obviously doing this  if  to get his name out there  if critics and fanboys  weren't suckers for  simplistic nihilism  and high pressure marketing  afterlife would be  universally acclaimed  as a visionary feat  superior to inception  and avatar  on every level 
[01:21:30]  is this guy just  fucking around  sounds like my kind  of movie review  i think he's just  fucking around  maybe he's like  my grandmother would  say he's full of  turkey  he really is like  opposite guy  uh let's see  bizarro reviewer  95%  which one is that  where  a film unfinished  oh i never heard of it  so fuck it  yeah  exactly  i  he didn't like  step up 3d  this fucking guy  step up 3d 
[01:22:00]  did you see  step up 3d  no i missed it  i'm waiting until  the blu-ray 3d  comes out  because even on  the nagletron  they look a little  better  no they don't  a little better  can't  a tiny bit better  slightly  dude they look  a little more crisp  impossible  i was having a  little twilight zone  festival of my own  uh over the weekend  also and  and you gotta kinda  you gotta clip the screen  on on the wide screen  you gotta go to that  regular where the  bars are on the  side of the tv  and and i'm watching  this thinking  how did 
[01:22:30]  we ever watch  television like this  how did we ever  watch fucking  like almost square  tvs  who thought that  was a good idea  and then when the  letterbox tvs came out  people thought that  was weird  people didn't like  letterboxing  hey people that don't  like letterbox  i always liked  letterboxing on my  regular tv  it's like  now i can see the  whole movie  it's a little smaller  but uh you know  what are you gonna  do  but but like the  twilight zone  i had it stretched  but everything is  looking a little  fucked up and and  kind of distorted 
[01:23:00]  because you know  it's old shit  so i just went to  the standard uh  resolution of the  old tvs  and it was like  what the  how the fuck did  we ever watch this  shit  square is still good  in a lot of cases  no it's not  although i'm moving  like this week  oh yeah  and so i may say  goodbye to the  nagletron because  that thing is not  an easy thing to  move  no it's got to  weigh like 300  pounds  it's horrible  yeah  i may have to  say goodbye to  the nagletron 
[01:23:30]  which i don't  want to do  but i also  don't want to  move it  are you gonna  have a new  landlord  oh yeah i'm  getting rid of  this  you want to  talk about  your old  landlord yet  yeah  no he's got  no i talked  about my old  landlord on  special delivery  i don't care  if i just  can't mention  his name  getting files  where you  move  uh no the  building isn't  wired for  files yet  he needs a tv  first before he  gets to  files  yeah i mean  what difference  does he make  you gotta hear  about his  landlord  seriously  this is good  radio  oh my god  his landlord  invited him and  jess to dinner  the barbecue  the apartment 
[01:24:00]  that we live in  now  sex with jess  uh pretty much  uh pretty much  yeah in a manner  of speaking  oh wow  exactly you  cuckold  right he's all  man but the  apartment that we  live in  wait is the  barbecue the  big uh is that  the headliner  i think so  yeah did he do  other stuff before  the barbecue  just follow-ups  he was all right  go ahead tell the  story really fast  the apartment we  live in is it's in  a building but each  apartment is owned  separately so our  landlord just owns  the apartment that  we're in it's not  like a corporate thing  it's just the guy  owns the apartment 
[01:24:30]  so we deal directly  with him and so  like after living  there for a year we  didn't sign a new  lease but we were  just like yeah we're  just gonna stick  around he's like  okay and then after  a year and three  months or so he  started texting and  calling like to  pursue a personal  relationship he's a  fan of jess's and i  never who isn't i  never gave him my  phone he never had  any contact with me i  always told jess just  to deal with it oh  shit that's what are  you dumb and so  you don't tell an  attractive girl to 
[01:25:00]  deal with some  fucking guy wait  it was over the  phone it was that  personal that's how  it starts over the  phone but he's a  weirdo yeah why  would you let your  chick deal with him  instead of protecting  her she's with you  you're a weirdo  she's into weirdos  this guy is like i  mean i'm we anyway  he started uh no  this does you gotta  hear this he started  leaving uh jess goes  sam you gotta hear  this voicemail that  the landlord just  left and this was  like over the summer  and i go okay  and he leaves this  voicemail he goes 
[01:25:30]  hi uh uh it's uh  so and so i was uh  i was thinking that  uh uh uh you and  and and sam of course  sam would could come  over to my house uh  you could come over  uh it could be on a  saturday or a sunday  and just come over  and we would have  some food and maybe  some drinks we'd eat  and and you'd have  something to eat and  you'd come over and  sit down have some  food uh we could  drink something if you  wanted to have  something to eat  talking like this  this is on the  voicemail  wow  wow then i could  drug your boyfriend  and rape you with a  hammer  and we go oh 
[01:26:00]  and so uh we  just called him back  and she was like  yeah we get uh  sam's real busy  works on saturdays  and da da da  and he goes well  we could do it this  weekend or next  weekend or then any  other weekend  oh great  and we go oh  jeez so we have  no and we go okay  so we made a weekend  to finally do it  and we went over  there and he was  like he lives with  his mother  holy shit  like his old  mother  he's  norman fucking  bates  he's definitely  ocd and probably 
[01:26:30]  autistic too  wow  because he was like  he's repeating  everything as  where he takes us  a tour around the  house he's he's  twisting the picture  frames you know  making sure everything  is just right  he's like he's got  his mom lives in  her room she doesn't  really leave her room  she seemed like a  nice old lady but  it's just a mattress  on the floor  oh wow  that she slept on  and then like a  chair with a tv tray  attached to it and a  small tv  what a sick scene 
[01:27:00]  this sounds like  and then he brought  us into his dad's  old office because  his dad had died  like six months ago  stuffed animals and  animal heads on the  wall  no but a wall full of  firearms  oh  firearms he likes  he's a collector  that sounds like a  reasonable fella  but instead of having  them locked up  whisper or put  they're just on  hooks on the wall  hanging on the wall  yeah just on hooks  never know  and uh and he's  showing us all these  rooms everything  it's just all kinds  of horrible things  and uh we go back 
[01:27:30]  downstairs and there  was a mace gun in  the kitchen  and i just all right  well we just won't  mention that we've  seen that and just  try to get through  the evening  and uh why would  you go there man  you put i would  never put my girl  in that kind of  danger  i guess we didn't  really  unless you're packing  i wasn't  did you feel like  i had no choice  and you had to do  the barbecue with  the landlord  the first one  yeah i mean i told  her we wouldn't be  doing it again  the first one  because he wanted  to do keep having  like a social  relationship  oh boy  and so he explained  that the mace gun 
[01:28:00]  was there  because if you uh  if there's a robber  yeah  and he shoots him  yeah  then the bullet  could go through  his wall of his  house and into  his neighbor's house  that's why he used  hollow points  no he used a mace gun  instead  and then  what does a mace gun  do  it shoots mace  at assistance  but out of  like how  you know what i mean  it's like  it looks like a gun  is it like a  water pistol  but it's filled  with mace  you load a mace  can in it  like with it  you'd spray  you just load it in 
[01:28:30]  so does it shoot  spray  yeah it just shoots  the liquid  further  and stronger  it's crazy  this guy's crazy  and then we  like he started  making his dinner  we said alright  we'll leave  at 6  and he goes  6.30  we'll leave  at 6  ok 6.30  he told you  6.30  that's when he  said ok fine  6.30  and so  while we're in  the kitchen  he's turning  he has to turn  the faucet on  off and on  like 4 times  every time  he turns it on  off on  off on  off on  off on  and then he  started  making chicken 
[01:29:00]  made a giant  pan of chicken  did you look  to make sure  if he was  sprinkling anything  in there  yes  it was  marinating  in something  you couldn't  tell  the blood  of his  other tenants  I was gonna  say damn it  the last victim  but he literally  made enough  chicken  you probably  ate human  flesh  you don't  even know  it  he made  enough chicken  for 10  people  and he put  that in the  oven  and then he  made it  two full  bags of  carrots  and he put  that into  a giant  and he made 
[01:29:30]  all this  food  and then  it was 6  o'clock  already  when he  was just  putting  stuff in  he put  in baked  potatoes  at 6  o'clock  no  you gotta  go  it takes  too long  and so  we brought  it up  and he  goes okay  so he  rushes it  along  because once  you confront  what's going  on he  immediately  oh yeah  okay  okay  yeah  yeah  yeah  and so  he gave  jesse  me  giant  plates  full of  food  and then  he sat  down  yeah  and we  go  with 
[01:30:00]  like there's  tons of  food  aren't you  gonna eat  and he  goes yeah  I will  this is like  a serial killer  oh my god  it's like  it's poisoned  I'd be like  he's poisoned  this  he just sits  there while  we're kind  of picking  at it  just saying  when can  we like  leave  at this  point  are you  TV eating  you know  how they  eat on  TV programs  mixing  everything  around  and then  jess has  her leg  kind of  crossed  over her  knee  with her  foot  sticking up  keeping  that snatch  closed 
[01:30:30]  and the  guy  goes  oh these  are really  nice  shoes  are they  she's wearing  moccasins  and she was  like yeah  they're like  real moccasins  and he started  holding  her foot  with the shoe  on it  no way  and I was like  oh what  this could end  horribly  hey dude  I was  I was more  concerned with  leaving without a  confrontation  with your giant  plates of food  what was on the  plate  a lot of  chicken  carrots  and potatoes  that's it 
[01:31:00]  meal  that's the  whole meal  that's the whole meal  this guy's weird  and then he started  showing us pictures  from the 80s  of his friends  and family  that we've never  met any of them  this is the first  time we  dead  yeah  this was  she was  and then we were  like look  I gotta  I gotta get  home  because my  parents are  coming in  from out of  town  yeah  I don't know  whatever  he goes  okay fine  fine  you can go  and then  Jess goes  can we help  you clean up  why are you still 
[01:31:30]  being polite  oh why did  she say that  he goes  no no  just leave it  and she was  like well  should we  at least  throw it  out  and she  like kind  of eaten  the baked  potato  but pretty  much just  scooped out  the potato  and he  goes  no no  I'll eat  the skin  and we  go  we go  what  and he  goes  you don't  have any  socially  transmitted  diseases  do you  I'm just  kidding  but he  never made  clear  whether he  was  he took  the empty  skin  that Jess  had been  like some  of her  saliva was  on and 
[01:32:00]  just fucked  the potato  skin  oh he  used it  like a  fuck toy  while his  mother sat  upstairs  watching  television  what are  you doing  tell me  wait a minute  but  wasn't there  more with  the feet  well he  was  stroking  them  and holding  oh my  you just said  he held  the moccasin  no no no  he held  her foot  inside the  moccasin  why did  she allow  that  how far  up did  one hand  go up  her ankle  not far  past the  ankle  did he  touch  skin  he's a  foot guy 
[01:32:30]  he might  have touched  some skin  wow  because it's a  low cut shoe  yeah  you ask why  but I think  sometimes you get  in a situation  where you're like  fuck  just let him  touch your feet  so we get  out of here  alive  who knows  what else  he could do  and so we  finally got out  he was like  before you go  of course I'll  need to take  your picture  the time  you ate  the chicken  and so he  did  he took  our picture  how do you  wait wait wait  wait wait wait  it's a souvenir  hold on  before you get  to the picture 
[01:33:00]  taking  how do you  know for sure  that  that  you didn't  lose a couple  hours of time  how do you  know for sure  yeah  any roof  at all  no  you know  what I mean  like  I was conscious  sure  yes I was  sure I was  conscious  because we  were monitoring  the clock  the whole time  yeah good  good  you know  took a UFO  abduction  they lost  like three  hours  her asshole  hurts  and so does  his mouth  what happened  so like  we got out  of there  and then  I mean  we really  had to make  this move  thing happen  quick 
[01:33:30]  because like  a month  ago  he texted  wait wait  wait stop  the picture  because I  interrupted you  outside the house  yeah he took  a picture of us  outside the house  and then like  a week later  he texted  saying he  would have to  send give it  give us a copy  of it  we went  okay  like why would  we want a copy  of it  what  why would  you take  a picture  of us  he's  a weirdo  yes he is  a creep  is what it's  called  I wonder how  close he was  to killing you  guys  and maybe  something  happened 
[01:34:00]  maybe  I almost  maybe his  mom wasn't  supposed to be  in the house  or I don't  know  something  I almost  got furious  at Jess  because we  were sitting  it's a  it's  we were on  the ground  level of the  house in the  living room  and you could  see the front  door  windows  this is safe  territory  so you  had  there's a  downstairs  and an  upstairs  right  and so  20 minutes  into being  there  Jess  asked  for a tour  oh my god  what's wrong with her  first thing  they just take  us downstairs  into his garage  downstairs  where there's  no exit 
[01:34:30]  oh my god  where all he has  to do is lock  a fucking door  and the neighbors  will never hear  your scream  exactly  that's fucked  Jess is not  smart with that  I mean not as a  person but her  perception of  danger is not  good  no  she really needs  to stop doing  you're crazy  after that though  she got completely  and he texted  her like a month  ago and said  hey I'm making  some home  improvements  you and Sam  need to come  by again  and she goes  what do I do  say I go  just don't even  respond to him  he's just  a landlord 
[01:35:00]  you don't  we don't have  a relationship  no  no you probably  should respond  though and make  it kind of vague  like yeah that  sounds  well  six days later  he texted her  again  saying hey  you never responded  to the text message  that I sent you  six days ago  I'd be surprised  if your phone  doesn't get texts  winky face  oh Jesus  see I hated  your chicken  wow  and your potatoes  I shit for three days  yeah  and so we did  that's when we  started doing the  blow off thing  and saying well 
[01:35:30]  and then  and then we go  yeah we're kind of  busy  fall is bad for us  and he goes  fall  the entire season  when a whole season  when a whole season  is bad for you  you know you're  full of shit  and his response  is no problem  I'll text you again  we'll do this sometime  after Thanksgiving  but before Christmas  right  in the window  well that's good  so then you realize  that's the window  you realize holy shit  we gotta be out of there  we need an apartment  before Thanksgiving  that gives you incentive  to get the fuck out 
[01:36:00]  right  and then  where was the mom  the whole time  in her room  she doesn't leave the room  do you know  if she's alive  no we met her  she seemed like  she had it together  oh yeah  somewhat  but who knows  and then  he  when Jess called him  to say we were moving out  he was totally like  there was no emotion  attached to it  as if  we never  none of it ever  he was like  okay that's fine  okay that's fine  so when do we get  together again  he goes  but 
[01:36:30]  I'll need your new address  so I can send  your deposit  oh  no  let's just eat  the deposit  I said he'll send it  to the work address  he can have  Sirius's address  yeah  the guy's a  I wouldn't even  give him that  honestly  he's a fucking  asshole this guy  wow this guy's like  weird  he's a fucking  asshole  he's a maniac  he's got friends  what was in the basement  he had  the basement  was connected  to a garage  where he had  an old  where he had  an old car  that he and his dad  had put together  well you should have 
[01:37:00]  checked the trunk  of the old car  I'm sure there's  something in there  I'd rather not know  and then in the  little room  downstairs  I guess he  claimed he liked  sound equipment  so he had some  speakers that are  from the late 90's  plugged into a  Nageltron type TV  with a VCR  connected to it  that's the tape  when he's killing  people  well good thing  he records it  and then watches it  oh man  this guy  he might have been  in a serial killer's house  yeah you were  he might have been  I wouldn't be surprised  any lime 
[01:37:30]  did you see any lime  down there  I didn't see  any mods  I didn't see  but I really  wouldn't be surprised  she asked for a tour  holy shit  did he have a  great big fat ass  robe  yeah I don't know  why she asked  for the tour  probably out of  just nervousness  that's like  every bad movie  where the girl  will go like  oh can we have  the tour  and the boyfriend  is like oh boy  here's where we die  and then they do  and then the girl  gets an instant  hard on  like fuck  this is easy  yes why don't 
[01:38:00]  I show you  the basement  when we left  Jess was driving  and she just  got in the car  and just started  driving  we were going  in the completely  wrong direction  just to leave  just to get away  just get away  yeah  was she shaking  and crying  she was like  I was like  yeah that was weird  huh  and she was like  no  you don't understand  how uncomfortable  that made me  did she still have  chicken grease  on her foot  like  where she was  handling her ankle  she would have  if he had eaten  with us  instead of just  watching us  the whole time  eat  and just loading 
[01:38:30]  up our plate  with it  she gave Jess  probably six  full size carrots  on her plate  you know how many  and he kept  insisting  she took one  piece of chicken  and he stood  there for like  five  ah no  take another one  I know you're  hungry  that's not  the full dose  you have to take  more  yeah you might  wake up  how did you guys  actually put food  in your mouth  I know  like I would have  never done it  if he's just  watching  yeah I would  that's like  poison  I just wanted  it to go  sounds like a bad 
[01:39:00]  guy from Dexter  very good  yeah  gun toting  fucking  whatever the rest  of your name  is from Tampa  just go as  because obviously  he's got the OCDs  things and the  autism or whatever  it was  and what that is  is it makes it  so that the things  he plans things  in his head  yeah  so I wanted  everything to just  go according to  what was planned  in his head  so he could just  escape  well except for  the poison  what would have  happened besides  fucking serious  stock going up  what if you  started like  what if at one  point you started 
[01:39:30]  feeling like  woozy  and you'd be like  I would have been  like oh shit  like you drugged us  yes yes I did  and then he makes  the human centipede  out of you  and Jess  I would have gone  for the mace gun  yeah  would you rather  her lips be  sewn to your  asshole or  your lips be  sewn to her  asshole  I'd love my  lips to be  I mean if I  was in that  situation  and then she  because then  you'd have to  eat her shit  all the time  as opposed to  her eating your  shit and you  get to eat  like regular 
[01:40:00]  food  yeah I mean  it seems like  her eating my  shit seems very  selfish  yeah  but hot in a way  like dominating  but you're a very  picky eater  she'd probably  rather eat your  shit too  than the food  that she'd have  to eat to make  you happy  might as well  be shit  you dumb mouth  I want Sam  to prove to us  that he didn't  lose track of  time  I didn't  I stayed  conscious  I looked at  the clocks  because we were  very observant  of the clocks  because we said  we'll get there  what if he's  fucking moving  the clocks  man  oh no 
[01:40:30]  moving the clocks  yeah like  moving them  backwards  he moved them  back  he's got it  all planned out  all of a sudden  you're out cold  but then you wake  up and you're  like oh look  nothing happened  it's still two  in the afternoon  oh and he  like  the clothes  don't feel  like quite  right  on you  like they're  not sitting  on you  right  you gotta  kind of  adjust your  shirt  like why  is this  your underwear  is to the  right  just a little  too much  like what  my left  nuts  hanging out  the leg  of my  underwear  I hate  when that  happens  he's got  an area  where he  keeps  he has 
[01:41:00]  like raccoons  and stuff  he feeds  them  outside of  his house  dude  people  try to get  those are  pesky  you just  went through  a whole  ordeal  trying to get  their pests  yeah  and he feeds  them  he feeds  them  he tries to  attract  them  his victims  fingers  they're his  friends  he has no  friends  how do you  know  you ate  chicken  yeah  maybe it  was one  of his  raccoon  buddies  that died  I hope  it was  and it  looked  how was it  prepared  was it  regular like  bone chicken 
[01:41:30]  was it  chicken cutlet  it was  boned  chicken  like chicken  parts  like legs  and wings  and breasts  and stuff  different parts  and what was  the seasoning  I don't know  it was marinated  in something  and then  baked  cum  it was marinated  in his own  cum and the  blood of his  victims  I sure hope  it wasn't  semen and  blood  and then  whisked  they have to  whisk that  to get it  together  oh wow  that is  creepy  yeah  we might  I mean  he doesn't  I told  and then 
[01:42:00]  this is how  Jess  like you  had a  perception  of danger  I go  just give him  my phone  number  and say  Sam's being  bad about  time  just deal  with him  I said  start giving  him my  phone number  he'll stop  texting you  give him  my phone  number  and she  goes  no  because then  when I  want to  move  you'll tell  me  everything's  funny  because you're  dealing with  it  and I  said  what's  worse  so deal  with him  then  what's  worse  they're  calling it  the silence  of the  Sam's  actually  Joe W 
[01:42:30]  gets the  credit on  that  up there  in Boston  did the  rancher  make you  perform  fellatio  did he  make you  listen to  special  delivery  no  he's  very decent  man  was he  wearing an  opium  anthony t-shirt  because this  sounds very  familiar  no  okay  you will let  me know  if Sam  stops  screaming  and then  we had to  Jess made  me get  a lock  like a chain  or a deadbolt  or something  for the inside  of our door  because she was 
[01:43:00]  then I forget  who reminded her  that he's our  landlord he has  keys  you put afro  sheen in your  hair but not  today  that's great  multiple  migs  should have  thrown  jism in  your face  in my  role  actually Sam  would have  made the  yummy noise  and went  back for  more  just hung  out in  front of  the cell  catching it  like peanuts  why did he  need a photo  of you guys  I don't know  you think he 
[01:43:30]  was jerking  off to the  photo  I hope  not but  it's a  possibility  you think  of course  he was  he was  holding her  tootsies  maybe that's  his thing  maybe that's  just his  thing  and you're  lucky  so Sam  what happened  with the  chicken  I don't know  they're gonna  find those  photos in a  little secret  compartment  in Frederica  Bimmel's  house  he could also  be doing it  in stages  so you gotta  get the fuck  away from  this guy  maybe he  starts with  photos and  jerking off  on just his  face  sorry to say  that  then it  leads up to  him slicing 
[01:44:00]  your throat  letting you  bleed out  while he  has sex  with your  girl  well if  you make  it  if I'm  on the  show on  Friday  you'll know  I'm okay  when are  you moving  Friday  he's gonna  be waiting  does he know  what you do  for a living  you might be  listening to  so you're  gonna have to  leave a  forwarding  address for  mail  no no no  I mean I  never  post office  we know I  mean I still  get half my  mail sent to  my parents  house anyway  so okay  of course  you do so  I have an  address  you can  organize it  nicely for  you  check too  oh your  parents  oh yeah  yes  oh okay  great  he's gonna 
[01:44:30]  be after  your parents  then  yeah  wait  when you  know  CT2  hmm  Terminator 2  oh yes  he goes over  to the parents  house  they've lived a  long life  they got their  I have a feeling  Sam's father  could take care  of himself  yeah  they probably  do have some  is this guy  what's this guy  look like  uh  gotta pick a  celebrity  he doesn't  look  he's not  John Wayne  Casey  he's not  terribly weird  looking  he looks  like a clown  he comes out 
[01:45:00]  a little  painting  he looks a  lot less  weird than  I thought  when I heard  his voice  but his eyes  dart  not like  Stevie  but like  he's got  like crazy  eyes  crazy eyes  that's good  like they're  open  wide  he can see  everything  but they're  all like  you don't know  what's going  on behind  them  wow  like he's  not completely  in touch  with what's  going on  and who  does he  look like  like is he  big build  slight  no he's  I mean he's  not skinny 
[01:45:30]  but he's  shorter than  me  could he  overpower  you  do you  think  well I  mean he  probably  has a  rage  in him  that would  be hard  to  craziness  yeah  crazy people  usually have  that strength  you're fucking  nuts  I would  never have  gone against  my instincts  never do  that man  no always  stick with  your instincts  never  put your  chicken danger  like that  never  you don't  mean to  but  she didn't  help the  situation  she was awful  she was awful  she was terrible  she was a hindrance  never be nice  you probably  would have left  her behind  Sam  to eat a 
[01:46:00]  stranger's food  when he's  sitting there  not eating  even James Bond  wouldn't drink  the drink  unless the bad  guy drank some  or you'd switch  him  usually you switch  him  yeah  very smart  you would have  done that  him and Jess  should have  just switched  that would have  been smart  then they drug  each other  I just don't  know how you  ate the food  a limp  drunk Jess  that would be  so cool  he picks her up  carries her into  the room  you're just  passed out at the  table  you're facing the  chicken  clockwork orange  and he just 
[01:46:30]  picks her up  she's all  her hair is like  down  and he's  bringing her  into a room  and you just  like  you see  he lays around  the bed  and then the  door shuts  and you hear  da na na na na  da na na na  da na na na  da na na na  and he didn't  peel the carrots  what  that's weird  as hell  he left carrots  skin on  yes  how did he  prepare the carrots  that's where all  the nutrients  are  at least 
[01:47:00]  two  maybe three  full bags  of carrots  that you get  at a grocery store  he wanted to put  them in Jess's  vagina  and then put  on a bunny  outfit  and fucking  do a shining  moment  why is he  obsessed with  carrots  I don't know  he opened  all three  bags  he poured  them out  three bags  of carrots  for two people  he cut like  the top  and the bottom  off of them  and then he  just put them  into a pot  I said I  preferred  raw vegetables  while you were  passing out  he'd take a few  bites of the  carrot  and go  what's up  cock  and then he'd  have his dick  out  and you'd laugh 
[01:47:30]  as you pass out  and get a big  dick in your ass  oh man  no I didn't  that didn't end up  so he boiled  your carrots  no but I ate  mine raw  and my potato  raw  because that's  how I get  down  was it a cold  potato  yeah well you  put it in  cold water  that's good  because he  couldn't have  done anything  with it  it's really  good  a cold  potato's  good  they're  very starchy  is that better  for you  you slice it  yeah  they're horrible  they're very  they sat with  salt right  they're horrible  I tried it  it sucks  no they're good  it really does suck  and it's crunchy 
[01:48:00]  and cold  it feels fresh  but that's a raw  foodist would probably  like that right  oh I bet  yeah  I would eat a raw  potato every day  except not at my  landlord's house  kiss you later  kiss you later  I'm eating a potato  this is a very good  question coming in  where's Jess right  now he might listen  to the show and  realize this is his  last chance  that would be horrible  what's in the box  what's in the box  it's a Tupperware  with his hair in it 
[01:48:30]  silence of the  Sams  maybe he did cut  our head off  at least your mom  would save it  you'd be able to  talk to her  at least you could  visit it  like you could do  your hair  JD in New York City  you know for a fact  that two hours before  he served them  those carrots were  buried in his hairy  asshole  no I saw them  in the bag  you sure  don't matter  he could have  put them back  in the bag  might have been  a little trickery  oh he's just  getting off  yeah you like  those carrots  don't you  yeah  he had them up  his tiny hole  I would love to know  what his thing is  obviously  well I'm not even  going to say  obviously  doesn't seem like 
[01:49:00]  a serial killer  but he's into  some weird shit  why did he prepare  so much food  he's an asshole  that's why  the guy's a fucking  asshole and a kook  the only bigger  assholes are you two  for going over there  he's a foot fetish  he wants to suck  he wants Jess to  stand on his face  he wants to  worship her feet  three bags of carrots  he wouldn't hurt her  those represent toes  and he's making  baked potatoes  how many baked potatoes  for two people  so yeah  there's  he's not going to eat  he's got  he's like  why would he  invite you over  and not eat 
[01:49:30]  he's a dickhead  he's like  I'll make four potatoes  and Jess goes  well Sam's not going  to have a baked potato  and you could  this is why  I'm saying his mind  is just like  he's got a plan  he's going to go through  he goes  well I'll make four  just in case  of what  potatoes  he makes four potatoes  and one is served  here's what you should have said  we got something for you  in the car  Jess let's go grab it  I can't even wait  and she would have went  what  and he'd go what  he'd go no  come on  we brought it for you  we have to bring it in  and then he would have heard  peel out 
[01:50:00]  but the problem  with your plan  Jess would be like  we didn't bring him anything  I know  I didn't even tell her about it  I didn't even tell her about it  it's a big surprise  but it's going to take  two of us to carry it  it's her teeth  if she keeps talking  and then he'd have gone  Jess you stay here  I'll go help get it  yeah well if it's that big  yeah I'll help get it  you said no no no  it's a surprise  it's got a lot of pictures  of Jess's feet  you're going to love it  Sam hear me out  there's another  there's another take  on this whole thing  Sam's a cuckold  you don't make a lot of money  no  why not fucking sacrifice 
[01:50:30]  a little foot fetish thing  to get free fucking rent  so you think sacrifice Jess  oh yeah  not totally  but maybe hint to Jess  that it would be a good idea  to take her moccasins off  and maybe walk all over the guy  yeah suck that nigga's tootsies  oh man  oh no  you could have got free rent  maybe make some kind of deal  I would have to watch  to make sure  it didn't get out of hand  insist that you know  rent is free from now on  does Jess have  does Jess have like cute feet  I think so  I mean I'm not a foot fetish  no I don't have pictures  you want to come over for dinner  no 
[01:51:00]  do you have videos  of her toes crinkling up  foot fetish guys like that  when the toes crinkle  toes crinkle  what is that about  I don't know  I don't get that  sometimes I'll google  the word meaty  like because I'm looking  for a meaty pussy  so I'll like  look up meaty  on a dirty site  and then meaty feet  comes up  foot guys  love a meaty foot  a meaty foot  I never got that  I know when I'm looking  at a horrible fucking foot  but besides that  I like a meaty puss though 
[01:51:30]  yeah I know  did uh  people are suggesting  you want to see  Jess with another guy  and that's why you brought  her over  no I have no desire  you would be a cuckold  really you wouldn't want  to see it  no I wouldn't  how do you know  you don't have cameras  in your apartment right now  we painted  oh man  could he compliment the paint  before you mentioned it  you missed a spot  on the third wall  before you changed the locks  are you positive  that he was never  in your place  when you both were at work  who can be  how can you be  anything could be a camera  how can you be 
[01:52:00]  he's fucking keys  he's got keys  no how can you be  positive he wasn't  you could be sniffing  just his underwear  I would so put a camera  in there  well I mean he could be there  he could be there  right now technically  we got a chain on the door  oh yeah  which we chain  well you know  when we're there  when you're there  you can't chain it  when you're not there  here's what you do  put some baby powder  on the fucking floor  when you walk out  when the last one walks out  take baby powder  and put it all over the floor  on the inside  and this way  if he walks in  the fucking footprint  will be there  he'll just take his finger 
[01:52:30]  and spell you motherfuckers  in the powder  I'm gonna kill you  I feel like the cat  wouldn't have been safe  if he was there  or the cat would have  done something weird  yeah  fucking pissed behind  the self and hid  while you two  were bludgeoned to death  cats suck  maybe you replaced your cat  no Bruiser Brody  is Bruiser Brody  I don't know  here's a guy  here's a guy  here's a guy  he's got a little insight  on the vegetable thing  Kyle and Callie  Fred Quinlan  hello  hey bro  I remember when I was a kid 
[01:53:00]  the old man  the day before  he was about to kill a pig  he would feed it up  on vegetables  it would make the meat  taste a lot sweeter  ah  so you feed  you fill it up  on vegetables  like carrots  and stuff  and then when you  slaughter it  oh look at Obama  he's busting a move  in India  he's the nerdiest  black guy  in history  he's in  Pankot Palace  with the kids  call him  some guy's trying  to rip his heart out  a little Bollywood  for everybody  is that what it is  a little Bollywood 
[01:53:30]  so they feed the vegetables  and make it taste better  but there was no slaughtering  yeah but maybe  he like  something went wrong  with his plan  he had the opportunity  if he was going to  at least  he had the opportunity  to attempt it  he never attempted  I bet  I would bet anything  he's got at least  one semi-clad picture  of Jess  you think  that he took  somehow  it's his place  through the window  what floor  he knows how  through the window  it's  well it's  the floor above  the line 
[01:54:00]  it's technically  the second floor  you'd have to get  on a ladder  to take a picture  through the window  he's the landlord  he could be on the ladder  dude what would you  have done if like  I don't know  you went to the bathroom  whatever  and all of a sudden  you're just a little curious  so you look in the bathtub  and there's just a fucking  victim in there  a body  alarm  would you  probably would have  alerted the authorities  and moved out immediately  would you have  I would have left  the Nageltron behind  that's for sure  but if you see  something like that  would you have  your senses  to actually be able  to do something  or you'd be just  frozen in fear 
[01:54:30]  if I saw a body  in his house  when I was there  I would  how do you know  you would have  enough of your senses  like  knowing myself  I believe  I would  freeze up  and then  there would obviously  be something wrong  but I wouldn't  you know  I would avoid  eye contact with him  I would whisper to Jess  let's go  were you at any  and she'd go  why do you want to go  what's in the tub  a booty  whose booty  I would leave immediately  were there any points  where you were looking  around for a suitable weapon 
[01:55:00]  if something had gone down  were you looking  there was  there were not any points  where I was not doing that  oh okay  all points  was the mace gun again  it was in the kitchen  on the table  just on a table  it was in his package  it was brand new  package  oh oh  yeah like he bought it  from like whatever  oh god  brand new  he was trying  by the way  that's illegal  illegal to own  arrest this man  and he was  and he was trying  to intimidate you guys  a little bit  where is it  New York City  or  no  suburbs  oh suburbs 
[01:55:30]  right yeah  might not be  yeah so  what did you think  would have been  the best weapon  for you to have  and what would you  have done with it  all I was doing  was looking for  blunt objects  yeah  because I didn't  want to  we're not looking  at a scenario  where there's  going to be a fight  what you need  is a blunt object  a fight  a fight  Sam and the landlord  a blunt object  for one  swift blow  that would be 
[01:56:00]  enough of a  distraction  to then exit  immediately  the swift blow  yeah  would have been  what you were  witnessing  as you were  falling asleep  how great  would it be  is like  you see them  fucking  and you're  all passed  out  and then you  hear her  going  come on  faster  I think  he's almost  asleep  oh my god  she was in  on it  the whole time  and he has  a big skinny  landlord cock  that would be  horrible  how bad  would that  twist be  she was in  on it  the whole time  I would hate  that  let's go to  Chris in Alabama  Chris  what are you 
[01:56:30]  bad news  Alabama  mayor  how's it  going  I had a  landlord  one time  that was  almost like  Sam's  there  I grew up  in Buffalo  New York  and me and  my wife  at the time  this was our  first apartment  we went to  work one  morning  and we lived  on an upstairs  apartment  we had two  doors  downstairs  that led  into the  house  and then we  went upstairs  and there was  a second  door up there  well every day  when I left  I would always  leave the top  one unlocked  and lock  the bottom  door  that day  I came  home  I found 
[01:57:00]  it weird  that the  doors were  reversed  locked  I slipped  up  yeah so I  went upstairs  with my wife  and when we  did we  walked into  the bedroom  all our  underwear  was pulled  out of the  drawer and  laid out  across the  floor  why would  he put  the underwear  back  I have  no idea  he's lazy  and you know  what my guy  did say  while we were  over there  he goes  he said  yeah I see  they've been  doing some  work to 
[01:57:30]  the outside  of the  building  I drive  by just  to see  what the  building  looks like  from time  to time  oh no  trying to get  a glimpse  of Jess  he said  that  you got  uglier  her up  a little  bit  you think  she's  just  scar  her face  scar  her face  up  just cut  her up  just one  of those  scars  where she  could still  go through  life  where it's  not too  bad  yeah  yeah  we had  called  the cops  when the  cops showed  up  the cops  told us  that  there was 
[01:58:00]  a history  with this  landlord  that he  did this  with every  tenant  and that  it was  a regular  thing  but how  is he  allowed  to be  a landlord  it's a  regular  thing  it's in  the  least  you can  take the  underwear  and put it  on the  floor  why doesn't  the guy  put the  underwear  back  yeah  well because  he wants  to be  noticed  sure  he does  have a  key  right  to your  place  the landlord  must  so he  could gain  access to  that place  anytime he  wants  if I'm 
[01:58:30]  in there  I could  put that  little chain  on  Jess  try to  get through  the hangler  that's great  in the movies  too  the chain  we tried  to get  one of  those  bar locks  but  didn't fit  on the  door  why don't  we take  a break  Jess is  very unhappy  I'm telling  this story  he's very  scared  silence  of the  sams  is a  great  story  he's  going to  find out  about this  and we're  not going  to make  it  to  Friday  he'll  make  it  to  Friday  she's  texting  me  right  now  saying  you know  what are  you doing  yeah  you probably 
[01:59:00]  should have  waited till  next week  you guys  asked  give us an  update  exactly  have her go  over there  for a little  while  he probably  knows way  more about you  than you think  beverages  what do you have  for beverages  oh he kept  he kept  trying to get us  to drink alcohol  like he kept  saying we have  I have all  kinds of wines  he had like  six different  kinds of beers  I was like  did he buy all  this stuff  just for the  big barbecue  yes  and he kept  trying to booze  you two up 
[01:59:30]  four times  throughout the  afternoon  early evening  he kept  offering  different kinds  of wines  and beers  and alcohol  whatever  and we kept  just saying  just seltzer  water please  just seltzer  water please  just bottled  water that we  brought please  yeah  and then he  goes okay  well I'll have  a drink  and then  he started  drinking his  scotch  which he  enjoyed  oh shit  maybe  maybe he's  just a nice  guy that has  horrible social  skills  he rubbed  her fucking  feet  he's a foot  guy dude  he wants to 
[02:00:00]  suck her toes  he wants  he wants her  to jerk him  off with her  feet  I ate his  chicken with  a nice seltzer  water  that's true  a mulatto  tried to question  me once  idealistically  I'd like to  think he's  just has  poor social  graces  to me I  felt like  a lot of  the way he  acted  was like  if intern  David  when he  grows up  if he  just stayed  in that  sort of  wow really  like just 
[02:00:30]  stunted  developmentally  they turn  into killers  by the way  which again  that would  be not  the idealistic  turn  but the more  realistic  have you  looked into  his background  or anything  on some  of the  websites  that are  available  I'll tell  you I  like that  iPhone  has a  sex offender  app  because  check that  he's not  there  he doesn't  have that  but  did you  check out  his  criminal  background  oh no  I should  on the  thing  yeah  yeah  the thing  Danny uses  that  yeah  no I 
[02:01:00]  will do  that  use the  thing  why  those are  a bunch  of lies  you're  gonna be  smirch a  good man  saying he  was doing  things in  a schoolyard  with his  trousers  down  to pack  a lies  there was  a bee  flew into  my underpants  the boy  was trying  to help  me get  the bee  away  poor uncle  paul has  flyers all  over his  neighborhood  with his  face on  it  I thought  I was  popular  I thought  they was  welcoming me 
[02:01:30]  until a bunch  of the  fodders  dragged me  out of my  house  hit me  spreading  lies  Sam we  got a very  good idea  coming in  we just  want to  make sure  you guys  are safe  Kathy M  from Connecticut  writes  maybe Ann  should let  Jess stay  at the  house  for the  week  that is  a good  idea  it's not a  bad idea  if you  two of us  stayed  no no no  you'd have to  stay at the  apartment  and sit  with the  lights off  in the  corner  no so he's  not suspicious  so you know  he doesn't  think  you catch  him  you catch  him  but she  wouldn't be  in danger 
[02:02:00]  so you're  sitting there  in the  corner  with the  lights  off  with a  baseball bat  just waiting  for the  door to  open  Jess is  safe and  sound  at my  house  but what  if I  just did  that and  Jess was  in the  other room  anyway  do you watch  movies  do you know  how that would  end up  somehow it would  end up with a  knife to her  throat  with him  going drop  the bat  drop the bat  and it's like  how did she  get into  trouble like  that  if it's  just you  it's fun  at the  cumia  compound  that's  right  she'd be  you know  downstairs 
[02:02:30]  she loved  the movie  theater  with the  popcorn  machine  she got  to see  the bar  the karaoke  the studio  she'd have  the run  of the place  that's fine  I mean it's a  nice offer  but  just to look out  for her  though  the bunny ears  that she wore  on Halloween  Kenny made a  very creepy  comment about  the bunny ears  I wanted to  hop on my  face  actually he's  going to get  really mad  that I said  this on the  air  but mid  sentence  while she 
[02:03:00]  was talking  he asked  her a  question  she's  answering  and he  looks at  her  dead in  the face  and says  I can't  get over  how sexy  you look  in those  rabbit ears  he was  talking to  your television  the  Nageltron  Nageltron  doesn't have  rabbit ears  there's another  scenario here  I'm trying to  remember the  name of the  movie  and we'll  know  how about 
[02:03:30]  you fucking  set a trap  a booby  trap  and you  are waiting  for this  guy in  your apartment  dressed as  Jess  with the  Jess  that was  Nighthawks  Nighthawks  thank you  I would  just have  my back  to the door  you'd be  washing dishes  with your  back  you can only  see your  back  thinking it's  Jess  I would  have to  crouch down  a little  bit  because I'm  much taller  than Jess  you have  that fucking  horrendous  shit on  your head  that's my  hair  you have  a more  girly  body  I mean  young girl 
[02:04:00]  what's Thelma  doing here  there's a  masculinity to  it  wearing her  moccasins  you're a tough  guy when you're  shaving your  pussy in the  shower  oh my god  you gotta hear  this one  what happened  I was trying  not to go  phone topic  with bad  landlords  but this one  holy shit  well it'll make  everybody feel  better if they're  worse landlords  than mine  Jess will feel  better  listen to this  one  Rachel on  Long Island  what part of  Long Island  Rachel  Mount Sinai  I just want to  go a little  local today  what do you  got  I had a 
[02:04:30]  landlord once  me and my  boyfriend were  living together  and he had  a disabled  son who was  like 29 or  30  I'm sorry  again  I woke up  because I had  this really  weird feeling  and I look  over and I  see him just  sitting at the  end of my  bed staring at  me  what  was he  holding a  lawnmower  blade  you woke  up in the  middle of  the night  and this  disabled  adult  is at 
[02:05:00]  the end  on your  bed  I aim  to kill  you  with it  huh  he was  just sitting  up there  and at me  it was  really weird  I moved  down after  that  what did  you do  nothing  he just  sat there  and I  kind of  I hadn't  really opened  my eyes  all the way  they were  just kind  of squinted  open  and I  made like  I was  yawning  and I  rolled over  to my  boyfriend  and I  tapped him  a few  times  and he  kind of  coughed a  little bit  and I was  like  sit the  fuck up  and look down  at the end  of the bed  because you're  not going to 
[02:05:30]  fucking believe  this  and he wakes  up and he  just flips the  shit  and he chases the  guy out of the  house and he calls  the landlord  what the fuck  what the fuck  what the fuck  you do  with that  hammer  how long  after that  did you  move out  oh  two days  later  and you  were safe  this should have  blown the guy  okay  should have  blown the guy  these suggestions  I don't know  about  sucking the toes  and blowing the guy  I don't know  these are good  suggestions  have him leave  happy  alright Rachel  thank you  no problem  we should break 
[02:06:00]  it's nice to know  that there are  people with worse  landlords  and they ended  safely  so that'll make  Jess feel better  landlords in general  are really  really creepy  they are man  if it's a house  or something  they're really  creepy  you know what  it is they have  access to  everybody's private  lives  if you have  access to  people's private  lives  it's gotta be  tempting to look  lord of the land  that's why I said  wherever we move  it's just a company  that owns a building  yeah  just corporate  anonymous  there's no deals  there's no negotiating  no dinners  this is it  with lots of carrots 
[02:06:30]  all business  and how much chicken  there was enough  chicken to serve  ten people  literally  are you exaggerating  for the radio  no  enough chicken  to serve ten people  and have everybody  leave full  and with a smile  on their face  wow  alright well  lots of chicken  yeah  I mean at least  fifteen pieces of  chicken  god damn it  big bedo's right  from El Paso  hey Ope  you realize that  the three of you  are now gonna have  to testify at  this guy's double  murder trial  yeah  it's a double  what is a double  who's the victims 
[02:07:00]  with the double murder  you guys  oh man  we'll try our best  to get the death penalty  for this guy  for you and Jess  that'll be a memory  we'll make t-shirts  with your faces on  with R.I.P.  and buttons  and they'll be like  in front of the building  there'll be like  candles and flowers  and the news will be here  here's where the  gruesome murder  took place  we'll have a walk-a-thon  for Jess  of the beloved  Jess and stupid Sam  it won't even be  about you anymore  because she's  no  she's really good 
[02:07:30]  looking  the media will pick up  on how hot she is  and you'll just be like  oh yeah  and her dumb boyfriend  they'd just be like  everyone would read  the story  and wouldn't even  care what the story is  they'd be like  what is she doing  with him  oh god  but I'm trying to  pursue a career  in entertainment  yeah well  well  you're not gonna  be much of a career  if you're dead  you're right  you gotta  smarten up kid  you should record  a lot of Hits 1 shows  so your voice  could go on  for the next few  like Michael Jackson  and Tupac  so you should start 
[02:08:00]  recording that now  just start voice tracking  like crazy  yep  would you have been  more comfortable  if you had  had a gun  oh yeah  I would like  and the longer  this conversation  goes on  the more  I want a gun  this evening  exactly  I wish  guns are just  the great equalizer  a nice little gun  right under the bed  right next to where  I'm sleeping  just in case  it'd be great  just rack a shotgun  a lot of people  asking if we would 
[02:08:30]  have Jim C  help with the  investigation  I don't know  I think Jim C's  too busy  to deal with the guy  with the carrots  and the fucking  potatoes  and the fucking  chicken  he was a bunny  Sam  a bunny  don't arrest that  man  he wasn't black  they dusted for  fingerprints on the  moccasins  yeah  there was saliva  on the girl's  toes  and there was a 
[02:09:00]  little bit of  carrot under the  nail  we believe the  perpetrator was  eating carrots  he was African  American  we found his hair  all over  oh no that was  Sam  not you Sam  the other Sam  Sam  yeah  the Asian Sam  is the one  with the good  radio show  we found  ground up  baby aspirin  on the chicken  it's a girl  her name is  Jess  we thought it  was semen  it was just  a little bit of  it was just 
[02:09:30]  a little bit of  salted milk  with crackers  in it  what kind of  milk is that  buttermilk  buttermilk  he had  buttermilk  in his pants  if there was  a scenario  where he was  in the apartment  at night  and I woke up  and shot him  would I be  okay  it depends  don't shoot him  in the back  never shoot him  in the back  it does give him  access to the  place  but what if he  had to break  the chain  still  it could have  claimed some  kind of  emergency 
[02:10:00]  his family  could claim  there was  some kind  of a gas  leak  maybe  he needed  to get in  you need  to feel  as if  your life  is being  threatened  before you  could use  deadly  physical  force  can I make  something up  an intruder  I think  you can shoot  an intruder  yeah but  there would be  a lot of  fucking shit  going on  with the  landlord  if you  would blast  the landlord  because he  does legally  have access  to the place  so you  can't just  get him  for breaking  into the house  but if I  said his  hands were  going towards  my neck  and I felt 
[02:10:30]  as if my  life was  threatened  maybe  that would  go to  grand jury  depends on  the jury  go to  grand jury  if he had  a weapon  on him  you'd be  better off  fingers crossed  if he killed  Jess  you'd be  fine  yeah but  then I  would not  be  Jess would  be  deceased  and that  would be  a shame  you're still  alive and  you got to  shoot somebody  that would  be great  Sam what  you have  to do is  go way up  town and  get an  illegal  oh no  have that in  your apartment  fucking couple  of years  mandatory  hear me out  it's not  for him 
[02:11:00]  oh  but you  fucking put  it in his  hand  drop it  fucking kill  a little  drop gun  little handkerchief  and just like  on the TV  show  dust off  the prints  dust it off  and then wrap  his hand around  it to get  his prints  on it  yeah  and then  but we saw  the powder  burns  weren't close  enough  we knew  he had  fired a shot  Sam  he gets mad  there were  fish sticks  all over the  floor  we knew  a child  had been  eating  Mr. Monaghan  which is  Detective

[02:16:30]  the vote  out  mr president  you can't  write hillary  has fat  legs what  a cnt  i ran  i ran  out of  characters  we  understand  that  i ran  out of  characters  should i  add it  to that  that's  pretty much  what obama  tweets though  obama called  me at  my house  he called  yeah he  called me  at my  house  in las  vegas  this is a  bit  uh  we doing  a bit  scary  he actually  called you  he called  me at  my house 
[02:17:00]  yeah  but he's  not the  brightest  guy  because he  said he  was calling  for harry  reid  and i'm  like barack  harry reid  harry reid  doesn't live  here and  the man  don't listen  he just  keeps talking  i'm like  barack  you got  the wrong  number  yes that  was a bit  that was a  bit  i just  have to  confess  i'm calling  for harry  reid  can i tell  you something  because i  do have  to apologize  i really  your acting's  really good  i really  thought obama 
[02:17:30]  called your  house  so i'm  the idiot  in the end  okay  you should  give like  acting awards  for comedy  bits  two jews  walking to  a bar  are these  fictional  jews  with their  family  slaughtered  in the  war  i want to  confess  i wasn't  trying to  be a jerk  i really  thought  no no  no that's  fine  they own  it but  is there  a lean  on it  who is  the lean  holder  you're  out there  in vegas  are you  very political  at all 
[02:18:00]  did you  keep tabs  on the  old harry  reid  and how  he  actually  stayed  in office  there  a little  bit  yeah  i don't  follow it  that closely  i just love  the negative  ads  i think we  talked about  that last  time  every two  years  four years  this year  was really  good  some of  these ads  were really  fucking good  the one i  heard recently  was he  voted to  allow seven  year olds  to be  tasered  you know  as if that  was the  man's 
[02:18:30]  platform  i want  to taser  seven  year olds  when i'm  elected can  we have  some seven  year olds  on the  stage  with me  i'll swear  it and  then i'll  taser a  seven year  old  it is  amazing how  they take  something that  is in a  bill  for like  it gives  police maybe  the authority  to taser  anybody  that is  causing a  commotion or  a problem  whatever  and they  take that  and go  well does  that include  a seven  year old  well technically  in the bill  we don't have  an age limit 
[02:19:00]  we never put  an age limit  in a year  he signed  a bill  to taser  seven year  and meanwhile  it had nothing  to do with  tasering  seven year  there's no way  to explain  the thing  in time  yeah you  did you  not have  enough time  in the  other ads  so you  just bash  him back  he voted  not to  taser  seven year  olds  he's no  fun  he's not  fun  he's just  not fun  do you want  somebody not  fun  in office  now you've 
[02:19:30]  been uh  what just  playing like  the big  jernts  or what  you  i haven't  seen you  in the  smaller venues  uh  lately  yeah  well  i started  i got  i got much  too famous  no no no  i  last time  i kind of  missed the  comedy clubs  in some  ways  but last  time i  saw you  you had  a tour  bus  that's a  big jump  oh wow  yeah he  was doing  a tour  bus  shut up  about the  tour  oh really  is that  bad  no it's 
[02:20:00]  it's all  right  i used to  take i used  to buy 30  day greyhound  bus passes  when i first  started so  it's oh  wow  yeah  so to go  full circle  where could  someone get  those now  did you see  america  yeah  doing the  bus thing  yeah man  it was uh  but what was  weird is you  know you'd get  on a greyhound  bus and  one time i  got on a  greyhound  bus and  literally there  were no seats  available and 
[02:20:30]  i had to sit  on the floor  of the greyhound  bus  oh  well we got  to the next  stop and  then a seat  opened up  sit on the  floor  i'm like uh  wow talk about  paying dues  yeah  i'm paying some  dues here man  the only greyhound  bus story i  ever have  was that one  i told about  my father  when when  my mother  sent money  out to  my dad  in california  because we  were staying  with my dad  to fly me  and my  brother back  out to new  york because  we were coming  back to new  york and  my father  promptly cashed 
[02:21:00]  the tickets in  and saved the  month took the  money and bought  us greyhound  bus tickets  no wonder my  mom divorced  him  so we  spent about  two weeks  going cross  country with  what he gave  us was a  hundred dollars  each to go  two weeks  he probably  took the  money to  put into  your education  fund  yeah that  was it  yeah yeah  i learned how  to drink beer  you gotta tell  brian how old  you were  uh i was uh  i think i was  14 at the  time and my  brother was  oh that's not  bad i thought  you guys were 
[02:21:30]  younger  no we weren't  that young  but but it  was it was  really bad  half my head  fell asleep  for a month  because of the  way i had to  sleep on the  back of the  chair there's  that metal  thing and and  it cut off the  circulation to  like my scalp  and and half my  head was asleep  i thought i had a  stroke at 15  it's like really  bad and and they  they stop  everywhere and  and you get you  become less than  human man you know  because i i was on 
[02:22:00]  some of those bus  rides that were  literally over 24  hours because they  do have to stop all  the time oh yeah  yeah you know and  uh it isn't like  you're just going  straight from florida  to new york you're  stopping at every  single city along  the way  the bus rocking  back and forth  i was on a bus  when i was on a  greyhound bus one  time and i had the  seat way in the  back you know like  that's when you look  down the aisle the  bathroom is in the  back and there's  three together in the  back and the only  seat that was  available was the  one literally right  next to the bathroom 
[02:22:30]  and the guys driving  in the middle of the  day and i don't know  why he thought this  but he the guy just  pulls the bus over to  the side of the road  and like looks gets  up and says well  apparently the guy in  the back take a look  around everybody and  everybody turns around  and looks at me he  goes apparently he  thinks it's okay to  smoke pot on a bus  so i'm pulling over  we're gonna let this  bus air out and we  ain't going anywhere  until the bus smoke  there until the the  pot smoke clears out  and i'm like what the 
[02:23:00]  hell are you talking  about i don't i didn't  smoke any pot and  everybody's turning  around going what the  hell are you doing i'm  like i didn't do  anything yeah sure you're  stoned i think the guy  just wanted to take a  break and that's how he  does it he just he just  blames the guy next to  the bathroom for smoking  pot he threw you under  the greyhound bus yeah and  i wasn't assertive i  wasn't assertive enough to  like say i hey i didn't  smoke pot i just kind of  sat there and took it you  know i'll take wow  that's funny i'll take 
[02:23:30]  the blame i'm sorry  everybody and the  people you meet we met  like a male prostitute on  his way from like la to  chicago we're on the  bus with fucking rico  rizzo and john voigt  i'm telling you as well  it's uh i was i was on  a an overnight bus ride  one time and uh it was  about four in the morning  and i was asleep but then  i woke up and i heard the  woman next to me behind  me you know between the  crease and the seats say  to the lady next to her  i'm pretty sure my  brother killed somebody 
[02:24:00]  i'm like i just i need  to go back to sleep i  don't want to be in on  this do we have do i  have to stop and report  this now just whisper  back i never saw your  face yeah i don't know  you i don't know what  you look like i won't  turn around i promise  those things are just  human cattle you are just  ushered in and and the  course it takes looks  like uh the dotted line  on an old indiana jones 
[02:24:30]  movie map where the plane  goes like it's never  straight you're never  just taking a freeway all  the way across pain in the  ass unbelievable yeah  obama's in uh in india yeah  see that one they showed  him uh doing some native  dancing he's doing some  bollywood uh for india and  it uh it was just as bad as  when george w went to africa  that one and he was doing  like the he was trying to it  was like he was doing the 
[02:25:00]  steve martin king tut dance  that's all i could uh conjure  up but obama has zero uh  dancing he's a complete  nerd or rhythm or anything  uh not that i should say not  that i'm saying he should  have rhythm have you seen  him play basketball you know  it's not it's not like the  like he's adequate but he's  not as good of a basketball  player as as one might think  as he should be well when  you're playing against the  president who's gonna who's  gonna knock the ball out of 
[02:25:30]  his hands i mean you know  what i mean it down face  face you yeah commander in  chief you can yell face but  you have to follow with mr  president face mr president  as you're tackled by secret  service there's uh michelle  obama she's dancing around  with uh some of the young  children from pencott palace  she's they just got freed they  just freed them obama got the  stone back with the three lines  and uh they knew because the 
[02:26:00]  uh crops started growing can i  do any more temple of doom  jokes before anybody gets  anything i'm talking about  or cares i'll be honest i was  lost i'm a big indiana jones  fan i was a little perhaps a  little too big  there we go oh yeah they're  doing a little  look at the white teacher  oh they have to wait wait they  have to stop the music they have  to stop the music for a second 
[02:26:30]  hello this is bill from dell  computers  no really my name is bill did you  unplug it and plug it back in  yes you did hold on i got to  continue with my flow chart  yeah they're having a good time  oh they certainly are i don't  know dime i don't know what they're  doing but they're doing something  yeah playing some instruments  that's good for them could have  gone to any school music class to  do this you didn't vote did you  brian  in the midterms i did not 
[02:27:00]  oh oh well you're not a true  american  i know i know i feel i feel guilty  i have a good excuse i have a good  excuse  i have a good excuse  oh he's got an excuse  what i was relaxing around the  house  that is a good excuse and uh you  could have just told obama what you  wanted to vote for when he called  yeah i got i got you on the phone  right write me in for uh  like he's a bookie 
[02:27:30]  i'll take uh i'll take harry reed in the  fourth right  how many points does he get  hey a lot more people would vote if it  went through a bookie  yeah  you kidding me maybe you make a  couple of bucks  that is a great idea  yeah because that's what the  american system is based on  getting money for your vote  well oh it's not  i know  they just do it a different way  that's how harry reed got uh  elected  the unions  the unions like the harry reed 
[02:28:00]  he promised the unions a little  bit of uh cash  sure  from washington  did you run  did you run the marathon while  you were in town brian  no  but my hotel  overlooks the  the people running in  to central park  yeah  and uh  it's funny you look out  every half hour to 45 minutes  and you can see  the different rate of speed  the different uh  you know  quality of runner  yeah you look out at the  two hour mark when the leaders  are coming in  and these guys are like  literally sprinting  you know 
[02:28:30]  and then an hour later  it's a very fast pace  an hour after that  it's pretty good  and then from then on  it just starts degenerating  you know  if you watch long enough  you will see guys running in jeans  you will  how many hours in until you see the white people  and the clothing  the clothing  taking the barricades away  then the white people start coming in  no  the beginning  beginning of the line looks like  black hawk down  and there's a skinny cross the finish line  a skinny cross the finish line  and the bellies get bigger too 
[02:29:00]  you notice that  oh yeah  yeah  and then at the end everybody's walking  and i'm like  well what's that all about  thank you  you know  what does it have to do with  there's obama dancing  it's just astounding  he's a nerd man  like jimmy always says  what's he doing  he's urkel  he's doing the urkel  wow that is horrible  the little kids are doing better  that's it  that was  very nice  yeah  president obama  in india  took a big  load of people over there  security people 
[02:29:30]  like 2,000  3,000  or something  to make an impenetrable ring  around the hotel  they're staying at  you don't need that many people  i travel with like 800  yeah  you don't need 2,000 people  you don't have 800 people  you can get by with 800  you can  it's absurd  ah shit  they have a bunch of aircraft  going over there  they said it was costing  the taxpayers 200 million  but the white house is  I think if you gotta  protect the president 
[02:30:00]  to that extent  he should  it's not worth going  well he should just  stay in the white house  his entire term  they shut down  New York City  when he comes here  they pretty much  shut it down  frozen zones  and all sorts of stuff  it's amazing  in the old days  the president  just walked down the street  hi  how you doing  shook hands  got his head blown off  like a few did  Lincoln went to a play  he's just hanging out  John Wilkes Booth  is able to just go to  the box that he's in  yeah where is he  in here  yeah  he's in here 
[02:30:30]  he's enjoying the play  go on in there  say hi to him  well I wasn't here  to say hi necessarily  go right in  yeah he's right in there  guy opens the door  for him  there you go  he's right there  he's the guy  with the big hat  he's right there  he's enjoying  American Cousin  yeah that play  never took off  yeah no  you never see a revival  you don't see a lot  of revivals  our American Cousin  they should bring it back  they really should  I'm sure it was  if the president went  to go see it 
[02:31:00]  I'm sure it was good  it's gotta be good  it's gotta be a good  play  one head off  no  screw me  whatever  yes  yeah they'd have  those whistle stop  things where the  president's on the  back of a train  and he's just  talking to people  sure  now no one gets  to see him  if you want to get  elected president  I think you come  to New York City  one time  you know and then  they like snarl up  all the traffic  and everything  and he should like  you know find some  place and say 
[02:31:30]  ladies and gentlemen  if you all vote  for me  I promise you  I will never  come back  to this city  I promise  you'd get so many  votes  I would love that  nothing worse  than here  and you know  and President Obama  will be arriving  in the city  we have closures  of Manhattan  Queens  wait a minute  you're closing  entire boroughs  only New Yorkers  get upset  you know  like the Pope's  coming in  people go  ah damn it 
[02:32:00]  ah damn Pope  how am I supposed  to get to Brooklyn  well he's the Pope  he's kind of a high  figure  any other city  would be like  we're being honored  the Pope is coming  you know  an honor  the visit  from the Pope  it's great  anything that happens  in New York  it fucks our traffic  up  that's all  anybody cares  his dancing  is embarrassing  oh you're watching it  that's why JFK  wouldn't put on a cowboy hat  when they asked him to  in Dallas  because he didn't  like being photographed  should have put on  a Kevlar helmet 
[02:32:30]  screw the cowboy hat  he didn't want to  look ridiculous  that's true  if he only knew  how bad his hair  was going to look  an hour later  and then LBJ said  is that a dog  I'll pick it up  by its ears  you gotta be careful  man  he didn't want to  wear the cowboy hat  that's true  he would not put it on  at breakfast earlier  I believe it was  they offered him  a cowboy hat  and he wouldn't  put it on  he goes  oh you've come  to the White House  you'll see me  wearing this 
[02:33:00]  and um  I think that was  that morning  or the night before  put on a little  propeller beanie  with a target on it  now that's silly  yeah fascinating  you guys were  talking about the Pope  did you hear about  the gay kiss-in  oh yeah  the gay kiss-in  it should have been  gay kiss-in  as in sit-in  kiss-in  kiss-in  it came out  gay kiss-in  I thought  gay kiss-in  yeah about 200  people staged 
[02:33:30]  a gay kiss-in  as the Pope  drove by  okay  yeah and then  the rest of them  jeered at the Pope  they jeered him  oh yeah they jeered him  that's how you  literally do it  you actually say  the word jeer  jeer  you yell the word  jeer loudly  jeer  and you can add  as many e's  as you want  jeer  unlimited  that'll hurt you  that'll cut you  to the bone man  somebody jeers at you  yeah so they  while he was  driving by  they were making out 
[02:34:00]  oh yeah  guy on guy  make out  what was he doing  asking the driver  to stop  he's just not the  most masculine  Pope we've ever had  snapping pictures  I don't blame  gays for fucking  hating him  he should  well he's just  interpreting  what he thinks  is biblical  isn't he  isn't he terrific  you know  hey by the way  sorry for all the  ass fucking kids  I'm not ready  with that  something about  a man laying  with man  Brian has left  the studio  Brian has left  the studio  I'm taking a  left turn 
[02:34:30]  Brian has left  the studio  hey man  I was trying to  drink coffee  and all of a sudden  I saw it just shaking  his left head  oh no  there goes my  career  how about them  pop tarts  though  pulp tarts  he always try  to blow up  Brian's career  when he's here  that's why the  visits are less  and less by the  way  you know  no no  it's not that  I'm just kidding  I'm kidding  I love coming  in here  I just haven't  been doing  I know you  I'm just fucking  busting your balls  the first time 
[02:35:00]  I realized  the power of the  show is  remember the  people were  eating the rats  oh god yes  and I did a show  that weekend  and people were  holding up placards  that said rats  eat rats  got any rats  and I'm like  what the hell  is this  what  what's going  on here  those were the  good old days  I don't think  the new bosses  would allow us  to have a rat  eating contest  that was  that was one  of the most  disturbing shows  we ever did  I know  with the serial  killer cook  that was  he was a chef 
[02:35:30]  yeah  well he said  he was a chef  I was convinced  he likes killing  animals  yeah one guy  was a chef  one guy  killed it  appropriately  we had  they had to  kill the rats  in front of us  wow yeah  and the other guy  was just bashing  over the head  what did we  get ourselves  into  yeah Mark  the chef  there  he was able  to kill it  in one  like one hit  he knew  where on the neck  to hit it  or whatever  this other guy  was just like  bashing it 
[02:36:00]  in the face  and it's just  awful  you know what though  Brian Ring was all in  he didn't run out  that day  no that was  I was intrigued man  my eyes were wide open  but I wasn't moving  do you remember  we were amazed  that we got listeners  to actually come in  and eat the rats  but do you remember  that some people  went back for seconds  because he made  that was the best part  of the whole bit  frenchie  all of a sudden  we're like okay  everyone got through it  and then a few people  were like hey  notice there's a little  left over  do you mind if we 
[02:36:30]  have some more  that would be  wonderful  the ultimate compliment  for a chef  it really is  is that when people  go for seconds  on your rat recipe  rat  and we picked  the perfect chefs  because then  the other chef's dish  people were actually  hurling  they couldn't keep it down  he put it in a pan  and just cooked it  like it was the civil war  like an old black skillet  yeah yeah  an old black skillet  yeah I hear down there  in South Carolina  they're eating rat 
[02:37:00]  just threw it in there  with no oil or anything  just heat coming  through the bottom  that's all it was  we're just gonna keep  cooking it  till it's dead  oh my god  yeah  that is the truth  oh my god  it really was  like they were in  one of those  civil war  POW camps  eating rat  and mattress ticking  everyone's saying  you rock  on the phone  so  Brian really rocks  they're very excited 
[02:37:30]  very nice man  yeah  what have you been up to  Brian we haven't even  asked you that yet  I've been  I've been rocking man  I do a rock show now  yeah  no  I just do the  you know  been out doing stand-up  constantly touring  huh  constantly  not backing off  a little bit  no  kind of the same schedule  you know  I try to do  a couple of weekends  a month  and you know  that's not bad  you don't have to go out  every weekend anymore  no  oh that's  no  no no no  I mean you know 
[02:38:00]  it's because  you're playing bigger places  my wife and I have kids man  I want to be home  yeah you can't be  watching them grow up  you know  absentee dads  or something  right  come home every  once in a while  just to say hi  and then you're  back on the road  you go home  and they go  your son knows  how to juggle now  when did that happen  yeah  he's playing a Harry Chapin song  might have been on the road  a little too long  huh Brian  he's got a lot of cats  and cradles  in his room  right  hey do they have 
[02:38:30]  a sense of humor yet  yeah  yeah  they're both funny  my  our daughter  our daughter always  tries big words  and she's only seven  and she doesn't quite nail  you know  like Mazagine  you know  are you reading  a Mazagine  and like I hope  she like never  corrects it  but  but I know  you have to  you know  I know  like if she ever  gets a job  with a magazine company  she can't still  be hanging on to  this is a great  edition of our  Mazagine  but she tried one  the other day  that I had not heard 
[02:39:00]  she said  daddy I finally  figured out  what cadenzuance  means  and I'm like  what does that mean  she goes  a cadenzuance  is like if you  think you want  an ice cream cone  and then one  just falls  out of the sky  in your hand  I'm like  wow  you're right man  that sure would be  a cadenzuance  but I just thought  it was beautiful  that anyone would  even have that  as a fantasy  that a world  could be like that  man I sure  could go for an  ice cream cone  whoa  man how's life 
[02:39:30]  wonderful  it's wonderful  very good  holy jeez  that would be great  yeah  just wish it  and look up  into the sky  and it'll fall  into your hands  I do think though  that whenever she  messes up a word  to be a parent  you should grab  her shoulders  and shake her  and scream  the correct word  that's parenting  you don't allow  them to make  mistakes  my father  used to slap  me in the face 
[02:40:00]  and put up  panties on me  saying mistakes  are for queers  boy  well see  that's what's  great about  our world  there's different  ways of parenting  different ways  of raising a kid  right  I like that  yeah  that's why  there's so many  shake them  shake them when  they make mistakes  absolutely  don't hit them  just shake violently  shake the mistakes  out of them  yeah I won't love  you if you say  that again  nobody will  yeah that's good  co-winter  what was that  co-dince-o-ince 
[02:40:30]  co-dince-o-ince  co-dince-o-ince  that is a good one  oh boy  yeah  yeah  I hear ya  well you know  it's one of those  Mondays  what do you mean  I'm just like  getting up  is just the worst  what happened  we were having fun  no I am too  I'm just  I'm just reflecting  on the  what happened  I'm just reflecting  on the  the fact that you  had to get up  Monday vibe  but we had the  daylight savings time  that was  it was easy today  and that's another thing 
[02:41:00]  it was a cakewalk  today  I really  I tweeted that  which was such  great knowledge  for everybody  the fact that  I don't like  technology  falling back  and springing ahead  automatically now  cause I kinda liked  looking at a clock  and going like  oh god  it's like  oh it's 10 o'clock  already  wait a minute  it's really  9 o'clock  and then you set  your watch back  everything just  automatically clicks  back now 
[02:41:30]  to what it's supposed  to be  cause we're all  you know  we're all under  government watch  they got some  satellites  that they're  setting you  if they could  set your clock  man  they could read  your Texas  man  Texas  Texas  none of us  are farmers  so why are we  still doing this  shit  why can't it  just be what  it is  I don't know  I think that's  a myth  I think the  farmer thing  is a myth  no cause I was  curious about that  one time  and I don't  remember what the  answer is  I'm not a very 
[02:42:00]  good learner  but I don't  think farming  is the reason  it's like you  smoking the pot  in the back  of the bus  people are  just like  and the  farmers  made us have  to turn the  clocks back  yeah I think  it's like a  knee jerk  thing  cause it  makes sense  but I don't  think that's  the reason  now I'm  gonna find out  I'm completely  wrong  why would  we purposely  make it  darker  well it's  lighter in  the morning  yeah but who  cares you want  it to be  light after you  get out of  work  who cares  if it's  light  why don't  they make  it lighter  on both  ends  thank you  you know 
[02:42:30]  what I mean  make it  lighter  in the morning  do that  how would  they do  that with  the clock  we would  have to  switch  make the  hours shorter  make a  40 minute  hour  isn't it  based on  the rotation  of the earth  why don't  we just  cut the  shit  leave the  clocks  alone  bunch of  faggots  we are  just  fucking  leave it  alone  or just  make it  a huge  hassle  and make  people have  to switch  their clocks  every fucking  day  every day  every day  it should 
[02:43:00]  switch  every day  at 2 o'clock  now it  goes to  3 again  you gotta  get reminders  every  remember  you change  your clock  every single  day  you know  how confused  everybody would  be  or instead  you jump  ahead a year  how great  would that  be  or 11 minutes  just a shitty  time  you know  it's always  a pain  traveling to  Arizona  because they  never change  their clock  and I never  know what  time it is  when I'm  going there  for a gig  and you know  they don't  acknowledge it  would you fit  in with the  rest of our  country  they blame  it on 
[02:43:30]  Mexico  and isn't  it parts  of Arizona  they hate  that  I think  that's  Indiana  I think  all of  Arizona  never changes  Indiana's like  right in the  middle of the  time zone  or something  Indiana  switched recently  but up near  Chicago  they don't  Chicago  they stay  on central  time  if anybody  has a commute  from northwest  Indiana  into Chicago  how do you live  on the border  of the people  that change  the clocks  and don't  change the clocks  that's gotta be  it just sucks  can you imagine  I don't know  it'll be over  at noon  what 
[02:44:00]  what time is that  an hour ago  I'm here  it's fucking  he knows  you're alone  that call  was coming  from an hour  ago  in the bedroom  hey are we  getting an answer  on this  oh yeah  we're very  professional now  Brian  we've matured  that's right  so it's not  the farming  it's not  the farming  alright  what is it  originally  as indicated  by time change  2010 fall  Brian  you wanna read that  when and why  daylight savings  was initiated  at the start 
[02:44:30]  of the 20th century  to help increase  production in factories  and boost morale  yes we must boost morale  and increase production  in the factories  boost morale  we're gonna change  the clocks  hooray  America  as they're getting  all sorts of weird  cancers  because they don't  know what they're  working with yet  we can't give you  a raise  but we're gonna  change the clocks  yes folks  it's time to  change the clocks  everybody do  the Charleston  it's time to  change the clocks 
[02:45:00]  unless you're  a colored person  whites only  change the clocks  yes my battery  is dead I think  I hate my  I hate when my  battery goes on  my oldie time  talk machine  I can't  oldie talk  stupid thing  oh wow  that bit was  gonna go  places  and we don't  have batteries  but I don't  have my  oldie time  battery talk  walkie talkie 
[02:45:30]  device  increase production  I walkie  and talkie  haha  how do you  how does it boost  you have the same  thought I do  because there's no  windows in factories  how does that boost  production in factories  I don't know  it's like  we can't make  any more widgets  it's only one o'clock  okay  how does it boost  I guess because  people wake up  early to go to  work and it's  lighter out  so they're like 
[02:46:00]  ah that's good  you never see  daylight when you're  in Hefty's  factory especially  the turn of the  century  and the whistle  blows that  Allentown song  whistle and then  they leave and  it's dark out  and it's dark  outside  I mean that  that's not morale  that's a morale  booster in the  morning but then  it's downright  depressing at night  and then six  months later they  boost morale the  other way  they just keep  boosting it back  and forth  yes  spring forward  fall back  which is the good  one  did we just do  the good one 
[02:46:30]  or the bad one  nah it's the bad  one  it's the bad  one right  it's gonna get  darker earlier  out  which one  why is one good  and one bad  well I kind of  like when it  stays light out  later  I kind of like  when you go  the other way  yeah  I don't like  like 3.30 in the  afternoon and it's  like starting to get  dark  that's creepy  I like when it's  dark when a comedy  show starts  I don't like when  it's daylight when a  comedy show starts  what's worse than a  7 o'clock show  selfish Brian  so I'm lobbying  so when I had  Barack on the phone  I said hey 
[02:47:00]  morale's up for  Brian Regan  I guess  I just thought  you've become so  huge that you  would actually talk  to Barack Obama  no no no  I feel like an  idiot  why  that was kind of  that was an  innocent question  that a boy  38 years  your junior  should have  asked  Brian's daughter  should have  asked  Daddy  the president  call you  I read it  in a  masagee  I got words  wrong when I  was a boy  and my father  would take a  cigarette and  burn the tip 
[02:47:30]  of my penis  until I said  it correctly  that's how I  learned  and you speak  so clearly  I do  I have amazing  diction  isn't that a  coincidence  I guess I  didn't have  my penis  burned as a  kid  exactly  well lucky  me  so is he  like a grammar  school teacher  was that his  technique with  all the kids  no he just  hated poorly  pronounced words  I guess  we should take  a quick break  because before  you got here  Brian we talked  for three and a  half straight  hours so we  need to take 
[02:48:00]  another break  three and a  half hours  why don't we  move the clocks  back we come  back we're all  going to feel  great  it's going to  feel well  rested  how about we  move it forward  one more hour  that means we'd  be out of here  I'd be home  why don't we  do our  I don't understand  the concept  ok you're right  brianreagan.com  he does have a  lot of great  dates in the  near future  all over the  place  waterbury  pittsburgh  colorado  everywhere  so go to  brianreagan.com  good to see  my friend out  doing big gigs  absolutely  thank you man  I mean I'm

[02:54:00]  i was sharing  the apartment  with was staying  on the team  so he sat us  both down  and he goes  well brian  and he didn't  want to like  say the word  cut  he goes i'm  just came by  well  just came by  to give you  the word  and i knew  what that meant  so i was like  i get it coach  that's fine  but looking  back i wish  i would have  like said  that's the word  and then got  my mom and dad  on the phone  he's right here  he just gave  me the word  i'm on the team 
[02:54:30]  he's here right  you want to  talk to him  he just gave  me the word  the word  yeah  so that's how  you get fired  they just give  you the word  yeah  i got it  came here  to give you  the word  came here  to give you  the word  at least he  had balls  to do it  in person  oh yeah  yeah  a lot of  these high  school coaches  they just put  the list  on the wall  and you have  to hope  that your  name's on  the list  oh yeah  that's not  good  that sucks  right  you can just  stay on the  team though 
[02:55:00]  pretend you  never saw it  i never walked  down that hall  what happened  they're just  too uncomfortable  to tell you  that you're  a fucking  retard  keep going  out to  practice  every day  there's no  uniform for you  just wearing  your civvy clothes  civvy  like a fucking  navy frog man  just bucket  that's what  you know  when practice  is over  we would put  our civvies  back on  and head back  to class  to the dorm  and our civvies  i'm a putz  but that was it 
[02:55:30]  after you got  the word  your sports  career was  over  that was it  yeah  i mean it  was over  before i even  went up there  to try out  i knew that  i guess it was  they're trying to  say if you eat  dark chocolate  you'll stress  less  cranky eat apples  sugar free peanut  butter  stop  that'll make  you less cranky  yeah  or more cranky  it doesn't say  it just says  cranky  just cranky 
[02:56:00]  apple sugar free  peanut butter  i think it would  make you more  cranky because  you're not having  a big mac or  something  yeah you're not  having something  good  right  some comfort  food  so you'd be a  real crank ass  if you're hungry  and somebody puts  that in front of  you you're going to  be cranky  what are they doing  this is just nonsense  on the news  i don't know if  that i guess i have  to talk to a parent  and since brian is  one and oh he's  still a little too  young  but but no i mean  the the kid as far  as uh eating things  goes with like sweets 
[02:56:30]  and stuff uh because  everybody now the  thing is yeah get  apple slices and  carrots and you give  them that instead of  like cookies and  they're just as  satisfied  well that's not  i don't think that's  true that's a bold  face  bald face whatever  that expression is  it's a bald slash  bold face lie  yes i know i never  bought into that  crap that a kid is  going to be like oh  i'll take the carrot  over the uh you know  oatmeal cookies 
[02:57:00]  well we started feeding  our kid um carrots  yeah like mushed up  carrots like baby food  and i got a i got a  kid update my kid's  poo went from not  smelling whatsoever  to smelling like cat  and dog poop  oh now it's starting  to stink up the uh  it doesn't smell like  human poo yet because  he's not he's not  getting all that  fucking chemicals and  stuff but it now  smells like animal  poo  sort of like a cat  poo do you do you  do you have to clean  it up you clean it  up you gotta scoop  out his ass  we never did that

[03:05:00]  for an elective time  he seems a little  oh wow that's a good one  that's brian  that's when brian was in sha-na-na  yeah  ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-banger thing  oof  big yellow one's the tie  how awful is that  jesus christ  who are you working  fucking 158th street here in new york  a purple suit jacket  and a multicolored tie  wow  You sure wanted to be noticed. 
[03:05:30]  Brian Rodriguez.  In lieu of an act,  I put on that outfit.  In lieu of an act.  They're going to pay attention to something up here.  Spin in circles until people vomit.  Something bright is on stage.  What is it called?  The carnival? The spin art or whatever?  Yeah, that's what that was like.  The suit or the tie is acceptable,  but together, it's just an atrocity.  You should have gone with one or the other.  It's a war crime. 
[03:06:00]  That's great, man.  But the material is good.  You should wear the curtain behind you.  It would be less embarrassing.  That's good.  Did you ever hear old material and you're embarrassed, Brian?  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy brings his stuff every once in a while.  And the weird thing is, this stuff was on TV.  Not your stuff, mine.  Yeah, my stuff.  Oh, not your stuff.  We bring it all.  But he's not here.  I wouldn't doubt it, man.  I wouldn't doubt it.  Oh, listen to this crap.  I had a tape from years ago that was on beta, 
[03:06:30]  and I never watched it.  And then a few years back, I found this thing  and had it transferred so I could watch it.  And I put it in.  It was like from 1984 or something.  Oh, wow.  And I felt like I had been kicked in the stomach.  Dude, you have to release that on something as a goof.  That's funny.  I was so bad and so green and so unready to be on stage.  It was, it was, it was, I could barely watch it.  When did you start?  Yeah.  I started in 1981. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, so you're three years old.  So this is like one of my first things that was ever taped,  and I had never.  Can you bring it in?  We do it to ourselves all the time.  Dude, there's nothing worse.  We do it to ourselves all the time.  There's nothing worse than all radio shows  and Jimmy's old stuff.  Oh, it's terrible.  It's so uncomfortable.  Yeah, we did shows where me and Obi first got together  at like BAB on Long Island,  and I have to, literally, I have to pull my coat over my face  because I can't look at anyone in the studio.  We'll play for everybody.  I'm so embarrassed.  You know what would help?  I think if you played a clip that we played last time 
[03:07:30]  for Jocktober for Brian, maybe.  No, see, that's not a clip.  See, that's when you guys started?  Yeah, they had something recently they played  where it was an uncomfortable.  You have it, right, Sam?  I can hear the vibe.  That's what I felt like.  15 years ago.  When I watched it.  I think we should hear.  I think you should hear it,  and you should hear how these guys,  not themselves,  but I think you should hear them trying to find their identity.  You got the FM voice.  Yes.  Obi, I don't know what the voice was.  And me, I was just happy to be there.  Like, I was just happy to be there, guys. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah, like a puppy with a tail going.  Everything was just, yeah, yeah.  More like a jackass.  We will play this.  I had to make an imitation for everything.  Brian, how about, we'll play this for you,  but you have to bring in five minutes from 1984.  I will try to find that.  Yes.  I will try to.  Three minutes, even.  All right.  There's nothing you could bring in that's worse.  Nothing.  All right.  We'll do that.  We'll do that, man.  Well, E-Roc's just walking down the halls.  Oh, that ought to take a while.  See, that'll give me time to go make a fake old version of myself. 
[03:08:30]  We're not nearly as bad as I'm saying.  It's brilliant stuff.  Does he look good now, or did he look like shit then?  We can't tell.  It's recorded in HD, widescreen.  He's referencing things that just happened.  Pulls out his iPhone.  What's with these cell phones?  Wait a second.  1984.  Are we really going to do this?  Yeah, I think Brian should know the guy he's hanging out with.  Oh, God.  All right.  Maybe this gives us hope that Brian will bring in something really old for us one day. 
[03:09:00]  Well, if you were aboard, then you guys have already been around for a while.  No, I wasn't aboard when this happened.  Oh, this is before it happened.  This is abominable.  I would have had one radio day, and I would have left.  No amount of money would have kept me.  The only defense I have is that this is about 14 years old.  Okay.  This is on the air?  Like a radio show on the air?  Yeah.  This is when we were in Boston, so you did this show.  Yeah.  You'll ask that again after you hear it, too.  I'll be the guest on it.  Oh, wait. 
[03:09:30]  That's not me.  It's Brian.  That's why it was so bad.  We had Brian Regan on.  So, dude, how does it look, man?  How does it look?  Obi was wearing...  Why?  Hey, Obi was wearing...  He had gotten a cool piece of jewelry from...  That's how he looked, by the way.  Let's see.  Let's see.  That was different.  Yeah.  Let's see.  I'll put kind of a wild hairdo.  All right.  It was a little wild.  A bit Prince Valiant-ish.  And Anthony would paint Obi as he sat on a Dutch boy can. 
[03:10:00]  So, dude, how does it look, man?  How does it look?  I see you are sporting a new piece of jewelry there, Obi.  What is that?  Well, our faithful listeners would know that we talked to a guy named Chuck from San Jose.  Yes.  And he markets cannibal wear.  Cannibal wear.  That's right.  That's a human finger bone.  Hanging from my little neck right now, man.  He sent us a piece of cannibal wear.  Check it out.  Cannibal.  Shut up, Brian.  Shut up. 
[03:10:30]  I'm laughing with you.  He sent us a piece of cannibal wear.  Dude, man.  Dude, man.  There's more.  No, that's it.  No, no.  There's more.  Oh, there is?  Yes.  There were more mans and dudes between the two of us.  It's all we used to say.  Bill and Ted.  Check it out.  Cannibal wear.  I'm styling, man.  Dude, isn't that creepy, though?  That was someone's finger at one point.  It's a finger bone.  It looks like from the middle knuckle to the knuckle right under your fingernail. 
[03:11:00]  It is definitely the curse finger.  It is.  It's the middle finger.  Right.  It's the middle finger, and it's the middle joint of the middle finger.  Dude, isn't that weird, though?  That was someone's finger, man.  They used that.  I'll tell you one thing.  I'm starting to feel like Greg Brady.  Oh.  Okay.  You know.  Too bad you weren't feeling like Mr. Brady.  You're red.  Oh, but you're red.  Oh, you're red.  Oh, yeah.  Was that the end of it?  No, we got more.  Oh, good.  It's still the end of the end. 
[03:11:30]  Everybody has to start somewhere, you know?  And I don't know how anybody gets anywhere in today's world, because everything gets  YouTubed and thrown up right now.  So anybody that's getting started at anything now, they put your worst nightmare up right  off the bat.  So everybody's quitting.  It's like, I'm not putting up with this.  Yeah, I saw it.  Ant didn't say finger enough either, which I think now you'd probably say it more.  It's the bone of the finger.  It's the middle of the finger.  It's the FU finger idea.  Finger, finger, finger.  And he couldn't say finger.  She was going to finner.  It's the finner.  Finger. 
[03:12:00]  Finger.  Middle finner.  Instead of finger.  Yeah, he threw his G's away.  I just kind of let it run on.  Finger.  Finger.  Finger.  I said finger.  Yeah.  I'll tell you one thing.  I'm starting to feel like Greg Brady.  Oh.  The tiki.  The tiki.  The tiki doll, man.  When we last left Opie, he had worn the tiki, the taboo around his neck.  Yeah, I'm not going surfing in Hawaii with this thing on.  What a great episode.  We're so happy to be there. 
[03:12:30]  It's not, you know, it's not horrible.  Really?  You know, what do you listen to?  It's not so bad.  What are you listening to?  Our little banter.  Our little banter.  Hoot-le-doo.  Hoot-le-doo.  Hoot-le-hoo.  What a great episode.  Oh, yeah.  I do believe that was the Hawaiian episode.  That's right.  It is pretty creepy.  We're going to have to call him to thank him for sending the cannibal wear.  That's got it.  Someone's finger.  I'm sporting the cannibal wear around my neck.  I don't even know who that was.  It's a little creepy. 
[03:13:00]  I definitely feel like Greg Brady.  Oh, not this one.  Finger.  Shut up, man.  The crows are on the radio.  The crows should have been plucking our eyes out.  Or the listener's ears.  They were merciful crows.  Wow, the phones are dead.  They've been ringing all morning.  Look at the phones.  Seriously.  Yeah.  They've been ringing all morning.  We've had one of those shows. 
[03:13:30]  And they're dead.  They're gone.  Wow.  Shut up.  We got your plugs in before that, Brian.  Because they're gone.  The crows are on.  So, see, if you bring in your stuff from 84, we'll be kind.  You couldn't be worse.  Is that supposed to entice me to bring in my tape?  Yeah, exactly.  See how fun that was?  That was a prime example.  Yeah, that's like watching an execution and go, see?  Now you stand up there.  Dude, my fucking, my 1993 tape when I was three years in, I was a happy to be their character.  I was trying high energy. 
[03:14:00]  And I was.  Yeah, what was the voice?  How we doing?  Yeah, you'd be like, hey.  Why are you doing that?  This guy is crazy.  I'm thinking, come on, people.  Oh, it was fucking, it was so, I can't even watch it with my girlfriend, to be ironic.  It's fucking humiliating.  She won't be your girlfriend anymore.  Of course she wouldn't.  I told her that.  She's like, I want to see it.  I'm like, I'm not even being funny.  You won't fuck me after you see this.  You'll never fuck me again. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, it's embarrassing.  Oh, it's awful.  We did it with, who else?  Voss?  We've done it with a lot of people.  Voss, yes.  Yeah, Voss, it was, oh, wow.  Bobby Kelly.  Oh, God, yeah, he was atrocious.  It was great.  And now, next, we'll do it with Brian Regan.  Oh, man.  Brian is probably not nearly as bad as us.  What's an example?  You got a joke example?  Yeah, you got a bit.  Were you doing, like, the same type of material?  No, I had, here's a joke. 
[03:15:00]  Knock, knock.  Knock, knock, people.  Close to it.  Really close to it.  I had a, I had some props when I first started.  Well, it works for us, some people.  You know, and, yeah, and I would go on stage with a bag of props.  Oh.  I had props for jokes I didn't even need props for.  I had a box, you know, you know that cereal 40% brand flakes?  Sure.  So, I would, that was in the, in the bag, you know, it was a reveal. 
[03:15:30]  So, nobody, nobody saw that yet.  A reveal?  So, I would get on stage and say, well, folks, I don't know about you, but I'm always getting  ripped off at the supermarket.  Um, I bought a box of cereal and, uh, it was less than half full and I brought it back  and I, I said, hey, sir, the box is less than half full.  And then he, and then I pulled the box out.  He goes, yeah, you bought 40% brand flakes.  I bet you the audience at that moment knew about feeling ripped off. 
[03:16:00]  They got 40% comedy out.  5% humor.  Less fattening comedy.  Club was 40%.  It's pretty strong stuff.  Pretty strong.  Wow.  Yeah.  Because, you know, you think about it, 40%, you know, that's less than half.  That's less than half.  So, I, you know, I drilled them with the literal stuff.  Yeah.  But I had to drive it home by holding up the box. 
[03:16:30]  Did you get a cease and desist from Kellogg's?  I had no doubt in my mind that you were so proud of that when you came up with it.  Oh, yeah.  The first time.  Like, I'm going to go get my.  To actually go buy a box, go buy the box of cereal.  I'll go, I'm, I'm.  40%.  You're probably just shopping one day.  You looked at that and went, 40%.  Yeah.  I had, I had a follow-up next to it in the bag.  Oh, no.  For the reveal?  Yeah.  For the reveal.  Okay, there was another reveal.  I love that there is a reveal.  You had to make sure they didn't see it. 
[03:17:00]  I think this is some type of lofty kind of, now wait for the reveal.  Okay.  And I said, yeah, man, I'm always getting ripped off.  And I said, well, what about this?  You know, I bought this product and it was completely empty.  And then I pull out this, remember that product, no salt?  Oh, yes.  And then, well, I had emptied it and he, and I go, and then he says, yeah, you bought no salt.  Then I take the top off and shake this empty canister.  And you got no salt. 
[03:17:30]  I don't know why I'm sharing these jokes.  It's fantastic.  It's fantastic.  Oh, God.  I love it.  I had to bring that bag to the showroom, set it on a stool.  Make sure no one touches it.  Nobody touches it.  Hey, don't touch my bag.  Who's touching my cereal?  When the prop bag goes out there, please don't let the people see the 40% brand because it's very important.  The reveal is very important at that point. 
[03:18:00]  It's a reveal.  Yes.  If they see that ahead of time, they're not going to laugh nearly as hard as when the big surprise comes out.  I kind of equate it with Bruce Willis being dead the whole movie.  That's how the audience is going to wish they were.  Yeah, it was bad, man.  It was really bad.  Everyone's got to start somewhere, and it's usually right at the bottom.  But then you think back to go, how did I even, why did I come up with a joke like that? 
[03:18:30]  Why did I go on stage and think anyone would want to hear that?  I think, actually, we've pondered why we ever got a job in New York.  Like, they listened to that and said, these guys are number one market material.  It's like, thank God the radio business is so fucked up and stupid.  No one knows talent or lack thereof.  Yeah, we were mad that New York didn't call sooner, if you remember.  Yeah, come on.  Why the fuck are they calling us?  We're doing great.  Bo-do-do-do-do sound effects. 
[03:19:00]  That was a great episode.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You guys said that seriously.  It was a funny episode.  Oh, I know.  We're talking about the greatness of it.  And I made it sound like I go to Hawaii all the time just to surf.  I'm not going to Hawaii anytime soon to surf there than I've ever done it.  Ever.  Cowabunga, dude.  Never been past Western New York in my life.  But I'm going to go to Hawaii.  I'm not going.  Can you imagine me out in Hawaii like I do every summer?  Please.  With this on? 
[03:19:30]  No way.  Well, you should have said, well, I hate to surf in Lake Kitchagoonie with this, man.  Kitchagoonie.  Is that right?  I always say that.  Is I wrong?  It's a Kitchagoonie.  Oh, who cares?  It's a shitty lake.  Kitchagoonie.  I know.  It swallowed the Edmund Fitzgerald.  It certainly did.  BrianRegan.com.  He's coming to your town soon, man.  Yes.  Oh, I said man.  I will be hitting the stage.  That's right, dude.  What's that?  Man, dude. 
[03:20:00]  We're just taking it old school, man.  Yeah, man.  He's playing in an auditorium, a few centers, a couple theaters.  This Brian Regan is becoming popular.  He'll be styling.  I have the, sometimes the video screens come down because when I hold up the 40% box of  friends, you got to see that.  You got to see it in the background.  You got to see that.  The laugh builds.  And you're just yelling into the mic because the crowd noise is drowning you out.  It's 40% love.  He's blowing out. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, you're beautiful.  I love that joke.  What's your oldest joke?  You don't have to say the actual joke, but how many years old is the joke?  Because you're always updating your stuff.  Well, you know, like that kind of bit.  One of them was, I said, my parents told me they named me after Thomas Jefferson.  And I said, I don't understand.  My name's Brian.  And they said, no, we named you after Thomas Jefferson. 
[03:21:00]  See what I'm talking about?  It is clever.  I kind of like that.  And then, and then, see that one didn't have a, and then I would, I would pull as a reveal.  I would show the photo of Thomas Jefferson.  He pulled a sling girl out.  Oh, fuck.  After.  I'll bet you want to hear old Brian Regan tape now.  Oh, God.  I would love it.  This is one of my first jokes. 
[03:21:30]  This is the difference between the two performers.  This might be the first joke I ever told on, on stage.  I think it was like, I was doing something about it.  Like, yeah, I was watching the news and they were showing a black hole.  Turns out it was just Oprah laying spread eagle.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Oh, yes, I did.  Black hole.  I did.  It was one of my first jokes, if not the first joke I ever told on stage.  Should have been the last one.  I know.  Leno loved that one.  Did that have a reveal?  Yes.  Flop sweat. 
[03:22:00]  Came pouring out of my head.  I will be doing that joke, the 19th and 20th, in Poughkeepsie at Bananas.  Get your tickets now.  Please open up with that.  Oh, my God, that's great.  Please.  That would be hysterical to actually just slip that into the middle of your act and just  see if it can get carried through.  Yeah, if it actually gets a laugh because of what you've done before.  Or a bad one I used to do.  This is embarrassing because I used to think people in Connecticut were always snooty.  And I would say, yeah, they're so snooty up there, they don't even eat chunky monkey 
[03:22:30]  ice cream.  They eat obese primate.  Oh, I hate that one.  As you should.  I fucking hate that one.  As you should.  It's hateable.  Did you show the same picture?  Oh, man.  Brian Reagan has left the studio.  I can't say anything.  Keep Brian in his theaters.  It's been a long time coming.  We want to keep Brian in his theaters and his centers and his auditoriums. 
[03:23:00]  No more chuckle huts for Brian Reagan.  Oh, peace, Brian.  Whoa.  Whoa.  That's funny.  Oh, boy.  Ow. </pre>
