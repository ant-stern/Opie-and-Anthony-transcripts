<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts.  This featured a heated debate between Opie and Anthony about Obamacare, with Anthony advocating for a revolution and Opie boasting about saving money under the plan.  Anthony's contradictory Twitter behavior—alternating between political rants and poolside photos—was also discussed.  Numerous listener calls dominated the pre-show, many requesting tickets to the upcoming "Unmasked" event.  This led to a discussion of banned attendees, including Lady Di, Marion, and Bobo.  A lengthy segment dissected the YouTube video "Summertime is Great," with scathing commentary on the performers and their family dynamic, referencing Dan Soder's prior involvement.  Other topics included wrestling tickets, Colin Quinn's potential Unmasked appearance, complaints about the SiriusXM app delay, and analysis of viral videos, such as a Wheel of Fortune clip and a news report interrupted by rioting college students.  Anthony arrived in the studio, noticeably sunburnt from his pool time, as the pre-show concluded with speculation about the main show's segments.

The main show started with a discussion of computer viruses used for blackmail involving nude photos.  This transitioned to listener calls about advanced car features—a Peugeot with a traffic-detecting drone and a Mercedes with infrared night vision—and a caller's somewhat incoherent anecdote about the Space Shuttle Endeavour.  The hosts then discussed Cinnabons and the Cronut creator's reluctance to mass-produce, criticizing his perceived lack of business acumen.  A humorous aside involved a family member named Osama.  The conversation briefly touched on Carvel ice cream before shifting to Oscar Pistorius' prosthetic legs.  A discussion of the British Royal Family and their perceived lack of productivity followed, along with a caller's suggestion for a cyanide-infused "Jonestown Cronut."  Anthony then detailed his recurring dreams of murder, burying bodies, and a cellophane-wrapped, urine-smelling woman. A therapist called in to interpret these dreams, suggesting a link to the impending end of the hosts' contract.  Further listener calls explored the evolutionary purpose of dreaming and offered additional dream interpretations.

The next segment focused on listener calls about dreams and sleep paralysis, debating the perception of smells in dreams and the prevalence of sleep paralysis.  One caller’s wife woke him due to his loud farts, while another described incorporating sounds, like a train, into his dreams.  Extended discussion and clips were played from a viral video, "Chip Ruins the Mood".  A significant portion analyzed a Wheel of Fortune contestant’s consistently poor decisions.  Announcements about upcoming events, including an Opie and Anthony Unmasked with Ron Bennington, were made.  Listeners shared dream anecdotes, including one about Casper the Friendly Ghost defecating and another about a child seeing their deceased grandfather.  A caller mentioned a college study on light-enhanced dream manipulation.  Numerous advertisements aired throughout.  Although a "Bird Man" caller was mentioned, no in-studio guest was explicitly identified.

This segment began with a humorous story about a two-year-old asking about chickens.  It then featured two video clips: the Wheel of Fortune contestant losing money and a Minnesota college hockey game riot where drunk students harassed an Asian news reporter with obscene language and miming sexual acts.  Jonathan provided a live account of the riot, detailing the chaos and the reporter’s mistreatment.  Dave added details about a student fleeing riot police.  Callers used offensive language, and the hosts found the situation highly amusing.  The conversation shifted to the Long Island Medium, with the hosts and callers expressing skepticism and mocking tweets from believers.  A caller mentioned their two-year-old nephew inexplicably saying "Tattletail" and "Castor Earl," leading to further discussions about psychic abilities.  Mention of a Long Island floatation therapy center was made.  The show was interrupted by a seemingly medical emergency for one of the hosts (Jimmy), followed by a commercial break.  Upon returning, the hosts announced the death of comedian Otto, expressing shock and sharing numerous crude and offensive anecdotes and memories.  They discussed his career, addiction struggles, and recent sobriety.

The subsequent segment largely focused on the death of Otto, with hosts and callers sharing numerous anecdotes about his offensive but hilarious material, stage presence, and uncompromising comedic style.  Specific bits, including newspaper reading with George the puppet and a David Letterman appearance, were recalled.  Clips of Otto and George's act, some extremely graphic and vulgar, were played.  Comedian Joe DeRosa called in, sharing personal memories.  A listener recounted a dream about Joe DeRosa, and a discussion about *The Godfather* ensued.  The latter half mourned Otto's passing. A “Cock Talk” segment featuring a caller's first homosexual experience was also included, punctuated by commercial breaks.

The final segment opened with a discussion of the Minnesota college hockey announcer video.  The focus quickly shifted back to Otto's death.  The hosts discussed his career, ability to connect with hostile audiences during the "Traveling Virus Tour," and sharp one-liners.  Clips of Otto and George's act, including sexually suggestive jokes and a discussion of Jeff Dunham, were played.  Listeners shared memories, often hilarious and shocking.  Otto's background—street performances, John Lennon encounter, and David Copperfield's appreciation—was discussed, along with a story of a woman physically attacking him.  The show concluded with tributes to Otto, the announcement of an upcoming Ron Bennington "Unmasked" segment featuring Otto on Ron and Fez, and commercial breaks.  Callers expressed shock and sadness, sharing anecdotes highlighting Otto's talent and abrasive personality.  No specific cause of death was confirmed, though the hosts addressed rumors and mentioned previous health issues.

[00:01:00]  Only a show this big could have a pre-show this good.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show with Sam Roberts.  Welcome, indeed.  Time to start another week of wonderful radio.  With the Opie and Anthony pre-show, my name is Sam Roberts, and we are counting down the minutes until Opie and Anthony begins, as we do every morning. 
[00:01:30]  Here on the Opie and Anthony channel, it's Monday.  Opie and Anthony will be live in just a few minutes.  In the meantime, you can celebrate that fact with me by talking about everything that they may be talking about today and everything that went down as we closed last week.  Call me up, 866-WOW1-WOW, 866-969-1969, and we can talk about everything that's on your mind. 
[00:02:00]  It was a big week last week.  It'll be a big week this week, a lot planned, not only today but throughout the week, and we'll get into all that as the pre-show moves forward today.  But why not start today's pre-show with what was for a lot of people the moment of the show on Friday?  Of course, Opie and Anthony made news recently by going out and saying that they can't believe that there hasn't been a revolution in this country, and that maybe there should be, based on the Obamacare thing. 
[00:02:30]  You know, they were talking about everybody losing their health care.  They were talking about everybody's premiums going up.  You know, and Ant, I tell you, when Ant gets on a roll with something, he, I finally understand cultism.  I get the whole David Koresh thing.  I understand why people went along. 
[00:03:00]  Because when you're sitting in this studio, well, that studio, we broadcast the pre-show out of this little closet studio next to the main studio.  But, I mean, when you're sitting in that studio with Ant, he can convince you of just about anything.  And he convinced the room how bad and unfair Obamacare was.  And I think we were all on board until we heard this from Opie at the top of Friday's show. 
[00:03:30]  After it was all said and done, and he crunched the numbers and showed me what I'm now dealing with.  I'm saving money.  Wait, so.  What?  I didn't save money.  Anyway, so.  I heard money.  What?  What was that?  Save money.  Yes.  No.  Come on.  So.  All right, look.  Yes, after all that and calling for a revolution, I'm actually going to save money on Obamacare. 
[00:04:00]  I swear to God.  See, this show that you listen to is very different than most radio shows.  So, you're saving money.  After all that crap.  Uh-huh.  And listening to you.  Uh-huh.  And getting influenced by you and calling for a revolution.  Now.  Barry told me I am actually saving money because of Obamacare. 
[00:04:30]  I want to know, though.  Not a lot.  I'm saving a little over 1%.  1%.  That's kind of a lateral.  And some of the numbers, you know, are dropped, like premiums and such.  What about deductibles?  See, the premiums go down sometimes.  Oh, the deductibles went down, too.  Deductibles went down.  What about your co-pays?  It went, oh.  I thought you lost your plan.  I did.  Oh, no. 
[00:05:00]  But then it got replaced with a better one.  It's what's called a blessing in disguise.  Oh.  A blessing in disguise.  See, and this is why this show is different.  I could have kept that info to myself.  Sure.  And kept the whole revolution thing going.  But I guess I got to throw myself under the bus.  I'm actually saving just a tad bit.  What started as what we thought was a nightmare turns out to be serendipity. 
[00:05:30]  As Obamacare now has a more affordable health care plan.  It was amazing.  But this all led to what was going on on Twitter over the weekend.  So I'm sure that we'll get into the talks of revolution later on on today's show.  Because Anthony, I love reading Anthony's Twitter.  Of course, Anthony Cumia.  Because it gives you some insight onto whatever is on the man's mind.  And this weekend was one of the more manic weekends I've ever seen. 
[00:06:00]  He was going back and forth all weekend between Americans standing up to a tyrannical government and talking about rights being taken away and all this with photos of his pool being open for the first time because it's warm outside.  So it was either, you know, everybody's standing up for their second amendment rights or look at my adorable cat next to my pool that's open.  It was amazing.  I loved it.  I loved it.  And he's a multidimensional man. 
[00:06:30]  And I think that's what makes him so good.  But he's definitely a good follow.  And I want to see what the weekend takeaway was for Anthony.  Obie was honest.  He said he went to his meeting and found out that Obamacare is actually good news.  Good news for him and his family.  I want to know what the takeaway from the weekend was for Anthony.  Was it Americans need to stand up to their government or was it I can finally take a dip in my jacuzzi? 
[00:07:00]  I don't know where his brain is right now, but I can't wait to find out.  Let's go to some phone calls.  We'll start with Jeremy in Maryland.  Jeremy, welcome to the pre-show.  Hey, what's up, Sammy?  How you doing?  Hey, I'm pretty good, man.  Hey, I used to be a huge wrestling fan when I was a kid.  I'm 39 years old, but I'm taking my 8-year-old to Monday Night Raw in Baltimore on next Monday.  And I was wondering, how do I go about, I guess, getting backstage or getting to where, like, they have, like, a meet-and-greet, man. 
[00:07:30]  I know you know all the ins and outs of that shit, but I couldn't find anything on the Internet or anything like that.  I think you just got to buy tickets.  Just, is it like, I mean, dude, I'm like three rows from the ring, and I just...  Why do people, they tweet me, and they call me, and they go, hey, dude, do you think you gave me some wrestling tickets?  No!  I don't know.  What?  I don't even get stuff like that from my own friends.  Why would I...  I've never met these people before in my life.  If you want VIP tickets, go to Ticketmaster and buy VIP tickets. 
[00:08:00]  I don't know what to tell you.  I know about tickets to Unmasked.  That's my event.  I don't know anything about this Monday Night Raw.  Lou in Jersey.  What are they calling me with that for?  Six o'clock in the morning.  What's up, Lou?  Good morning, Sammy.  How are you?  Good.  That's actually what I was calling for.  I'm predicting a little bit of chaos.  I'm sure you and Ope and Jim were getting barraged with ticket requests for this Unmasked.  And I think it's going to get a little bit more crazier as the week proceeds. 
[00:08:30]  Well, of course, Unmasked with Ope and Anthony is going down on Thursday.  And it's become a hot ticket because we're doing it at Caroline's Comedy Club,  which means only a few hundred people, less than 300, I think, can fit into the club.  And there's thousands of people that want to go see this thing.  So, of course, throughout the week, last week, we were hearing from Lady Di and Bobo,  who have effectively been banned, as has Marion, Lady Di's best friend. 
[00:09:00]  Marion was calling into the pre-show a whole bunch last week.  You think it's only going to get worse this week, Lou?  Oh, absolutely.  I think it's going to skyrocket.  Well, Colin Quinn, thank you, Lou.  Colin Quinn called up Friday to talk about maybe getting some plus ones for Unmasked.  Let's go to track four.  The thing that infurries me the most is the amount of white people jumping ship on being white.  Yes.  And going, yes, these white people, please love me. 
[00:09:30]  I'm one of the good ones.  Yes, look at me.  I understand.  My innate racism.  I do.  I know.  Yes, it's just this ingrained.  For some reason, white people can have an inherent racism.  It's like in our DNA when you talk to these people and when these people go on these shows  and apologize for their own whiteness.  That is acceptable to say that.  But if you then in turn said that there's an innate disposition for violence in the black community, 
[00:10:00]  now you're a racist who's generalizing everything.  But these are the same people that say that 100% of white people have some form of racism embedded in them.  Yeah, 50% of white people say it.  That's the other thing.  Yes, and that's it.  50% of white people will say that, too.  I think you need a whiteness studies class.  Yes.  A white study class.  I like it.  One of the important things, guys, I hate to ask favors. 
[00:10:30]  Can I get four tickets to the Unmasked?  Now, we need to know who you're taking.  One for me and then three for some friends of mine.  I got to know who the friends are you're taking, though.  Are they bothering me?  What?  I would love to know that Lady Diablo are bothering the shit out of you for taking it.  Harassing Colin.  I hope they're doing that.  I love it. 
[00:11:00]  Ah, shit.  Colin, Colin, I need tickets to the young bears.  As of this morning, Lady Di, Marion, and Bobo are all still on the Bobo list.  Unmasked is this week.  And none of those people, not only are none of those people invited, they're all banned as of now.  But I think Lou and Jersey was right.  I think this week we'll see them pull out all the stops and try to get into this thing.  I mean, we're hearing from people that we don't even know, like just super fans of the show that don't feel the need to call up all the time and make it about themselves. 
[00:11:30]  They are trying to get into this thing like crazy.  So you can imagine people like Bobo and Lady Di who have no concept that the show is not just a showcase for them not being able to get in.  I think it's only going to be it's only going to get worse.  The other big thing, you know, the Obamacare thing was huge on Friday, and that'll lead in nicely to where we begin on today's Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:12:00]  But I think the big takeaway for me was our analysis of Summertime is Great.  The hit new song on YouTube, our pal Dan Soder was in as we broke down this music video like nobody else can.  Let's start listening to how we broke down the song.  Summertime is Great with track eight.  Talk about poor body image. 
[00:12:30]  She looks like the son of a professional.  She looks like the daughter of a wrestler.  Why would she do this?  You know how much evil is out there?  Why are you doing this?  You know what, so far both kids look like children that got abducted and murdered.  First of all, the boy riding the bike at the beginning comes off a little effeminate.  A bit fruity.  And with the internet. 
[00:13:00]  You're saying top button on a golf shirt?  A little bit.  He reminded me of like a young version of the killer from True Detective.  He could use a cycle.  Blast those delts.  Now the girl has so much wrong with her.  She's like a chubbier version of the girl from Shameless.  Yes!  Yes, yes.  Much chubbier.  Even chubbier. 
[00:13:30]  She looks...  Who was the fat guy in Pee-wee's Big Adventure?  Oh my god, Francis!  She looks like Francis.  Pee-wee.  Pee-wee.  Nice bike, Pee-wee.  That's who she looks like.  She looks like fucking Francis.  You deal with Katy Perry, man.  She's going to be pissed.  Wow.  She wrote a whole song about this shit.  Bullying.  Francis?  Firecracker, right?  About Francis?  You're right.  Firecracker had the chubby girl jumping in the pool because it's cool.  It doesn't matter what you looked like. 
[00:14:00]  Well, let me tell you something.  Yeah, but if you want to make good radio, you make fun of that.  But the thing is, it's not...  Look, I'm not taking blame on this.  They know that YouTube has a fucking comments section.  She's going to get slaughtered.  Yeah, you put your daughter out to die.  It's crazy.  You put her in a video like that.  And Katy Perry is one of the hottest chicks ever.  So yeah, if she writes a feel-good fucking song...  Yeah, she probably shouldn't be singing those songs.  Yeah, you let an ugly person...  Yeah, Lord.  Yeah!  Lord should be singing Firecracker, Lord.  Exactly.  Poor Lord.  You're right, Katy Perry. 
[00:14:30]  I want a hint of fat on her.  With a wonderful tits.  Except in the titty.  But she's going to tell fatties it's okay.  Be beautiful!  Oh, okay, chick who everyone wants to see, topless.  I don't want to see Francis from Pee Wee and circling a pool like some sort of land shark.  You'll get yours, Pee Wee!  Oh my goodness.  Now, there is an update on the group.  Do you remember what this group's name was?  Three Beat Slide.  Three Beat Slide, right?  Yeah, there's an update on Three Beat Slide. 
[00:15:00]  We were trying to figure out on Friday whether it was a prank or it was a real group.  There is an interview that they did.  It's a foreign language interview, but still.  An interview nonetheless.  So I think we'll be able to get into that a little bit today.  Anthony just walked in.  And there is no doubt that he spent a little time in his backyard this weekend.  He looks like he just came back from Turks and Caicos.  He was just outside, in the sun, opening his pool, raging against the system. 
[00:15:30]  Oh my God.  Let's go back to Jeremy.  Jeremy, you're on the pre-show.  Hey, you fucker.  I wasn't bumming like Bobo, okay?  I was just fucking thought you knew some shit.  But obviously, you know nothing, bro.  I was asking you some fucking tips.  Look.  So, don't call me Bobo.  Don't treat me like Bobo.  I'm all for helping somebody.  I'm trying to do a radio show, though.  I can't help you find wrestling tickets right now.  I didn't ask you to help me find you, fucker.  I asked you for advice.  But do you understand that it has nothing to do with the show at hand? 
[00:16:00]  It has nothing to do with what we're doing?  It's kind of like something that you would call your buddy.  If I ask you about comm, I don't have any buddies, man.  You're my only buddy.  So be my buddy.  You're right.  You're right, Jeremy.  Jeremy.  I was out of line, and I apologize.  All right.  The doctor about to start.  I'm sorry.  I'll see you later.  I'll be listening to you later.  Are we still buddies?  Yes, sir.  All right, buddy.  Not buddies, but we're buddies.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  Later.  Thank God.  Thank God Jeremy and me are still cool. 
[00:16:30]  Because that was kind of, that's one of those things that was weighing on my conscious.  He was the guy who called in 10 minutes ago asking about wrestling tickets.  I'm glad that we covered all that.  But let's go back to the summertime video.  Let's skip ahead a little bit to the big reveal of the father.  Because to me, I think the real star of this band is the father that put these two little  kids up to singing this song.  Let's go to track 10.  Here's this guy with a horrid comb over.  Sitting on a cheesy motorbike. 
[00:17:00]  With obvious bad breath.  Yes, it does look like it's a bad breath.  We're not there.  Playing an acoustic guitar on the side of a road by like a field.  On a shitty, almost motorcycle.  I wouldn't.  If I had a child playing sports and this guy was anywhere near him, I'd be like, I'm pulling  him from the game.  I'm not letting the son play.  This guy has the hassle of having to tell all of his neighbors when he moves into town.  Yeah, fucking old clammy hands that's moving in next door. 
[00:17:30]  He's not allowed to celebrate Halloween.  Is this the father?  I think it's the father.  If I shave my mustache, people won't be able to tell.  You can tell he has really bad dandruff.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that comb over and everything.  It's just unhealthy scalp.  The beatings that you would take in school, based on that being your father, is so much  worse than anything else you're actually doing in the video.  Right.  Let's go.  Come on, guys.  Here we go. 
[00:18:00]  Well, if they didn't stop throwing so much ugly at us.  Yeah, I know.  They really are.  We can mow through this thing.  It's funny you ask.  I played in a band in college.  Yeah.  You know, we should make a video.  Kids.  That'd be fun.  Yeah.  His kids have no concept what cool is.  No, I'll bring the motorcycle out.  What do we write a song about?  Well, just write a song about something you enjoy.  What's something you like?  Summertime, Dad.  We'll write a song about summertime. 
[00:18:30]  Okay.  Now put your clothes back on.  We're going to show Alicia swimming.  Oh, yeah.  Get her in that swimsuit.  We need to sexy up this video.  His wife is yelling at him.  I thought they took the video camera away from you.  We have to move again.  It really is a humiliating thing.  You wonder if people realize when they're going to put something like that up, the impact  that it's going to have on their whole family.  We tried to explain exactly what the family dynamic was as we were watching the Summertime 
[00:19:00]  is Great video.  So let's move on to track 13.  That daughter's face, though.  The daughter's face is Francis.  The son needs hormone therapy immediately if they want to keep him from being something  trapped in something else's body.  He does look like he's a transgender mids.  He needs a strong shot of steroid immediately.  He's going either way.  I wouldn't know steroid if you bit me in the neck. 
[00:19:30]  But this boy needs some.  A rabid bat would bite her in the fucking neck.  He really does look like a guy that's either going to be a billionaire or end up...  Or a school shooter.  And the father just...  He's at the crossroads right now.  He's going to be like Steve Buscemi and Billy Madison just putting lipstick on and taking  photos.  And humming, it's summertime.  And the father will be completely bald by Sunday.  I bet he's bald by now. 
[00:20:00]  The father's got that look of somebody in a prison interviewer that's going, I've made  peace with myself and what I've done.  With the Lord.  Yes, with the Lord.  Jesus forgives me for just making all those people disappear.  I realize I've hurt a lot of people.  He'd love to meet the kids.  They're not here right now.  No, no.  Their mother has them.  Yeah, where's the mother?  Yeah, I'd like to find out what this family story is.  I'm telling you, who was driving the golf cart at the end of the video? 
[00:20:30]  His lady friend.  That also lives in the complex.  I thought it was a woman, though.  It was.  Maybe it was the mom's cameo.  Oh, she's just my friend.  You think the mom filmed it?  You know we can never replace mom.  Yeah, yeah.  This reeks of Jimmy Kimmel or dead mom.  Dead mom.  I think the mom is alive and they're putting it out because they want the mom to see it.  To see it.  And come back.  And be like, oh my God, my super talented family is putting music out.  You should probably use that strategy.  Maybe your mom will see the video.  She'll come back. 
[00:21:00]  Do you remember when?  She'll know we're living in that apartment near that rest area off the highway.  There's got to be something up with it.  And how good was Dan Soder, by the way, on Friday?  Amazing.  Always amazing.  Let's go to everybody's favorite caller on a Monday morning.  And, of course, I'm referring to super fan Eric.  Good morning, super fan Eric.  Welcome to the pre-show.  Oh, Sam fucking Roberts.  I'm so fucking fired up.  I can't believe it.  It's fucking Monday.  I got five days of work ahead of me.  I'm going to be making fucking hoagies for the city of the greatest city in America. 
[00:21:30]  The city of brotherly love.  Philadelphia.  My Philly.  They swept the freaking Marlins right back to Miami.  Get them the hell out of town.  My flyers.  We're coming after you, Sam, New York.  You better watch out.  All right.  I'll watch out.  My question is, what happens to people who want hoagies in the weekend?  You said you've got five days of work.  What happens if on a Saturday I drive down to Philly and I'm looking for a hoagie?  Listen, my place is open where I work.  I don't want to say who it is.  I'm not effort to plug.  I'm not to be a super fan.  I'm all fired up. 
[00:22:00]  Hey, you never know.  Some days I work on a weekend.  Some days I work on a weekend so that I have off during the week so I can go to the Flyer  games because that's how I live my life.  I'm a super fan for Philadelphia.  Well, Eric, it's always good to hear from you.  Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster.  I love you.  Can't wait for Monday Night Broad tonight.  Can't see what they have in store for the Ultimate Warrior.  Listen, you're the ultimate professional broadcaster, Sam Roberts.  I love you.  F. Larry.  Yay.  My boy Todd from Burlington.  Love you, buddy.  I'll talk to you soon.  Sam, good talking to you.  All right, I'll talk to you later, Superfan Eric. 
[00:22:30]  The last time Eric did that, Todd from Burlington was on hold for the rest of the pre-show,  on the main show, and on the post-show.  I didn't pick up his call, but the message was, yes, I'm the Todd that Superfan Eric brought  up earlier this morning.  It's like, so what?  His energy was a little lower.  His energy was, it was a little lower today, but that's because it's a Monday.  You know, Superfan Eric only gets more and more fired up as the week continues, so I  can't wait.  And quite frankly, I can't wait to hear from Todd from Burlington today either. 
[00:23:00]  Well, only a few minutes before the Opie and Anthony show begins.  Now, we've got a big show to get to today.  If you didn't see this video that was going around all weekend, stay tuned.  You're going to want to hear not only the audio from the video, but the show's take on  it.  There was, there's this great Wheel of Fortune clip that's been going around.  Maybe, and there's been a lot of good Wheel of Fortune viral videos, but this is maybe  the worst Wheel of Fortune player there's ever been. 
[00:23:30]  We'll get into that.  Some white rapper kid is posting a bunch of vines that Jim got turned on to, so we'll be  playing a bunch of those.  And, oh, this great news report from Minnesota.  Minnesota, I guess Minnesota lost the NCAA hockey championship.  And so this reporter for Fox Minnesota is outside on the street trying to do live shots  in the middle of this riot.  And these drunk college kids just won't leave him alone. 
[00:24:00]  Like, it's not like one or two of them.  They're just all rallying around him.  They're putting their hands on his shoulders.  They're pushing him around.  It's really one of the funniest things I've ever seen in my life.  So, we'll get into all of that later today here on the Opie and Anthony channel, on the  Opie and Anthony show.  You heard in that last clip that we played of the summertime video explanation that Dan  Soder was doing his Nancy Grace impression.  We got into Nancy Grace on Friday and her theory on the Ultimate Warrior dying and her, I mean, 
[00:24:30]  she just makes things up.  She comes from a place of being completely uninformed.  But I think the real takeaway was the doctor that Nancy Grace had on her show and the character  that it turned into with the great Dan Soder in studio.  Let's go to track seven, Sal.  It ruins your cholesterol, raises your blood pressure, it can cause a lot of heart enlargement  that can lead, actually, to an arrhythmia causing sudden death.  Can you imagine if the Ultimate Warrior got taken out by cholesterol? 
[00:25:00]  That would be crazy.  Yeah.  I don't like this guy's doctor energy.  Let me tell you something, cholesterol.  After all the years of just eating whatever I wanted, cholesterol, you're here.  This guy's doctor energy is upsetting me, too.  If he was my doctor, I wouldn't go back to him.  No, I don't like it.  Because he's that fun, like, science is fun energy.  Yeah.  You can learn about science.  Science is everywhere.  Shut up, doctor. 
[00:25:30]  Don't you have fun?  Put a little dye in the water.  See how it changes?  Science.  Shut up.  Science is in a flower.  Science is in the trees.  All around you.  Science.  I love that.  I could picture that show.  And it stinks.  And then they're like, can you talk about steroids?  He's like, steroids make people die.  Only 1%.  Oh, fuck this guy.  I think that he was in great shape, so why would he be found there? 
[00:26:00]  Yeah, but, you know, sometimes, oh, I don't know.  The last thing I am is a doctor.  But I am a doctor.  Come back to me.  Oh, do you want to learn about science?  Oh, welcome back.  I like that Diamond Dallas Page sounds like an old black musician.  He's like, I haven't been on the road for about 40 years.  I thought, school you, wow, wow.  Where does she get these people from? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  Well, she's trying to get Diamond Dallas Page to say that it's steroids.  Right.  And he's not going to say that.  Just slightly.  Well, Nancy, piece of vinegar and baking soda volcano.  It simulates how a real volcano explodes.  But now, how does this, what does this have to do with the wrestler?  It's like his heart was a volcano.  And it blew up catastrophically.  That may have actually been what happened. 
[00:27:00]  I think Dan Soder got to the bottom of stuff there.  Let's go to Daniel in Pennsylvania.  What's up, Daniel?  Hey, how's it going, Sam?  Good.  I was calling a complaint about that summertime video.  Yeah.  And then you had on the Dan Soder clip.  And I think you're the right person to talk to.  You're the producer.  Why is the delay so bad on the XM app?  Like, I call in all the time.  And you're like 15 minutes ahead by the time I get put on hold.  That's the magic of the internet, Daniel.  No, I know about the internet. 
[00:27:30]  The internet goes faster than that.  It's a series of twos.  Didn't you know that?  Oh, I didn't know.  I think there's not enough ones and zeros in the right orders.  Well, anyway, what I was calling about was that summertime video.  Are you guys sure that that's not, like, a goof?  Because I can't see that amount of ugly being, like, unintentional.  Yeah, we were actually talking about that on Friday.  No, we're not sure that it's not a goof.  The theory that we had was that Jimmy Kimmel put this together and it's going to be one of his big reveals that he does from time to time.  But I think that the fact that there's now an interview with this family, and it's like a Telemundo Spanish language interview, it makes me feel like it's more real. 
[00:28:00]  I don't know why, but it just, the fact that it's a foreign language interview, and the fact that it exists at all, and it really does look like it came from TV.  It doesn't look like it's a fake TV interview that they just put, like, you know, the graphics on, on some video editing program. 
[00:28:30]  It looks real. It's on their YouTube page, and we may get into that a little later today on the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's go to Russ in New Hampshire.  Welcome to the pre-show, Rush.  Hey, Sam, how you doing?  Russ, what's up?  Hey, so I was thinking, with these three retards, I want to get tickets to the unmasked.  Of course, you're talking about Lady Di, Marion, and Bobo.  Those are the three retards.  But I really think that you guys should offer up maybe just one ticket, and either do, like, a Hunger Games thing, where they try and kill each other for it, and Lady Di could literally be the girl on fire. 
[00:29:00]  Or, I forget the movie.  Remember the one where they all, they're all, like, these rich people that get these poor people with, like, diseases and stuff.  They sit at a table, and they kill each other off one at a time, and at the end, somebody gets a ton of money.  I don't know if you remember that one or not.  I do like your theory about making Lady Di the girl on fire.  No, Lady Di, it's just like Katniss.  Just, here, here's some gasoline, and here's a match, and she just lights herself on fire, and we wheel her down 50th Street. 
[00:29:30]  They should absolutely do something where they completely sell their soul for just a ticket to a fucking stupid unmasked.  That would be funny.  Thank you, Russ.  By the way, unmasked is going to air live.  So, for those of you that want to see it, that'll be on Thursday.  But I'm sure that we're going to hear from Lady Di and Bobo, if not today, throughout the week.  And maybe that's a good idea.  Maybe we offer up one ticket.  We light Lady Di on fire, like Katniss, in Hunger Games. 
[00:30:00]  And then we see who really wants it the most.  Because that's what it's all about.  Well, listen.  The Opie and Anthony Show is seconds away.  Big, big show today.  The Reverend Al story continues.  Reverend Al says he did not do cocaine.  And some guy came out and talked about, in that period of time, how much Reverend Al loved having that mic'd briefcase around.  Boy, did he love that briefcase.  I'm sure we'll get into that.  Billy Crystal is getting an FX show.  And he said that he's bringing back some of his characters from SNL. 
[00:30:30]  Like, what?  Nobody watches television.  Who remembers Billy Crystal on SNL?  These characters are 40 years old now.  Write something.  I'm sure we'll get into all that and more once the Opie and Anthony Show begins.  Which, as luck would have it, is right now. 
[00:31:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:31:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:32:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:32:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:33:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:33:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:34:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  From the murky banks.  The Opie and the banks of terrestrial radio.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and the Opie and the Opie and the Opie and the Opie and the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:34:30]  People sure are listening.  Two Long Island natives.  Island natives who together would one day change the world as broadcasting's greatest duo.  Oh, my God. It was beautiful.  After 20 years, these children of the 80s have arrived.  Their hugely popular radio show is not just in New York anymore.  Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, I don't show the radio.  Through 55-gallon drums and wiffle ball bats.  You push it in until you're comfortable. 
[00:35:00]  From mayors to mayor.  It was an April Fool's hoax by two radio disc jockeys.  With bottle rockets and brow bombings.  And wieners and pigs.  Opie and Anthony got their hands on the photo. I tweeted it.  Two men that have taken a box of cocks further than any.  Well, these people will definitely stop. Guaranteed.  Lift up the cocks.  They've met friends along the way.  Jim Norton.  I have a raging hard-on right now. 
[00:35:30]  Can I please put my dick in your dog?  And through fines, scandals, suspensions, cancellations, and terminations,  it's the one show that remains unscathed.  Striking fear into the hearts of management everywhere  comes a radio show that after 20 years remains above all else.  Real.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:36:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Morning.  Oh, there it is.  Another Monday.  Hi.  Another Monday.  There it is.  Another morning where we get to adjust all the buttons.  Yes.  And the knobs.  Don't know what shenanigans, hijinks, and chicanery happens in here.  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  That's right.  Oh, my goodness.  Dude, what did you do to your face?  What?  It was nice.  That looks so painful.  It's not too bad. 
[00:36:30]  How slappable is it, though?  Oh, God.  Is it your chest, too?  No, not really.  No.  You had a shirt on outside.  No, but I was in a pool.  I was in a pool a little bit, so.  Oh, you went in?  Oh, yeah.  How cold?  Well, I had the heater cranking for a couple of days.  So you got it up there, too.  So it was pretty good.  And then the jacuzzi was, like, really boiling hot.  So that was nice.  Yeah, I said, summer, open for business at my house. 
[00:37:00]  Open for business.  You threw out the first sunburn.  So I threw out the first sunburn.  I went out on the lounge chair.  Yeah.  Finally took the cushions out, you know, and laid down, grabbed a nice beer,  and then fell asleep for maybe an hour and a half.  And then I woke up going, like, ooh, I think I'm a little sunburn-y.  Your face looks very tight.  Yeah, it's very tight.  It's like sweating from the sunburn.  This guinea skin will turn fucking tan in no time.  For you.  I think everyone got a sunburn this weekend. 
[00:37:30]  A little sunburn.  We go from winter to, wow, first nice day, and then everyone's just getting sunburned  because it's insane.  It's freezing cold.  First you get a few days outside before you start realizing, oh, maybe I will get some sun  and I should do something about that.  There was no in-between weather.  This went from below freezing weather to you can actually go outside and lay down.  Get a sunburn.  Go out in the sun, yeah.  So that means a week ago when it was kind of cold, we could have got a sunburn, too, 
[00:38:00]  I guess?  Maybe.  If you're willing to lay out on a chair in 30-degree weather.  Well, why do you got sunburn?  Well, it's very uneven right now because, you know.  No, on your inner arms.  That's where it looks like it's really painful.  Oh, because sometimes I'll lay with my hands to my side, but sometimes I put my hands kind  of behind my head.  And I'll lay down like that.  You get your armpits burnt?  Yeah, a little bit, but not bad.  It's not too bad. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, the face is bad.  It's bad.  It's bad.  I was just kind of like fucking looking up at the sun there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It happens.  You know, it's the first, you know, the first foray out into the sunlight.  I want to pinch your cheeks really well.  Yeah, it would probably hurt.  I just want to pinch them.  Ow.  Sadistically.  I know.  It would hurt, Jimmy.  Well, looks like everyone had a good weekend.  Jimmy was in Tampa, right?  Tampa was good?  It was awesome.  Nice. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, it was a great club and the fans were, they're hardcore down there, man.  Yeah.  I forget sometimes because we don't go out and do like all these road shows, but yeah,  we have a lot of fans in a lot of different places.  Yeah.  And they were really good.  We just wouldn't know.  We just were in this box every day.  We were sequestered.  We used to get out there a lot more.  Yes, we did.  And, you know, comedy tours and the like.  The like.  I bet we could have filled a cruise ship up if I could just throw a random idea up there.  That never happened.  Why would you say that on a Monday? 
[00:39:30]  I know.  I'm just mad again.  Ah.  Yeah.  Heard you guys had a good rant this morning.  Shut up.  Boy.  Shut up.  Yeah, that would have been good.  Then I wanted to do a couple other events before the contract ends, but they can only handle  like one at a time.  One.  Just slow down.  One at a time.  Hey, bliply.  I know.  Whatever.  What are you going to do? 
[00:40:00]  Whatever.  I know a couple of the events you mean, or at least one of them.  I want to do the animation fest, but they can't figure out how to put it on the docket.  That's a big one.  Because we got the unmasked on Thursday, and then there's some other thing, I guess, planned  that we don't know about.  Oh, yeah.  Then they're thinking maybe a little trip up and down the East Coast.  Oh.  So, who knows?  We'll see.  Hmm.  We'll see.  Yeah.  Oh, my neck hurts.  Uh-oh.  I don't know. 
[00:40:30]  It feels like a bulging disc.  What happened?  Did you try to blow yourself?  Yeah.  It's always good for some neck pain.  Yeah.  Well worth it.  It's one of those where...  I just try to blow someone else.  It saves the neck.  Oh, it sure does.  You lose weight, too.  It's one of those where you feel like a good stretch will get it back in place, but I just  can't figure it out.  It ain't working out.  It's like the neck and the shoulders where that meets in the middle there. 
[00:41:00]  It feels like there's a fist.  Giant monkey fist.  I don't know what to do.  Maybe a little Aleve.  Ah.  Right?  There you go.  Bubba!  That'll get you going.  Bubba Watson winning the Masters.  Oh, he did?  He beat that kid.  I went for the kid, and of course he's got to lose now.  Oh.  Spieth.  He's a 20-year-old kid.  Came in second.  No one cares about this.  What are we talking about?  No one really cares about it unless, like, you know, when the old Tiger was in there. 
[00:41:30]  Right.  You know, that kind of made golf a thing.  Yeah.  But now everybody's like, oh, wow, who won?  I don't know.  Bubba Watson won it for the second time.  That's a good story.  Bah.  No one really gives a shit.  No.  No one really gives the old flying fuck.  You don't watch the golf?  No.  Well, I was not watching the golf.  The golf is good.  Yeah.  Yeah, you just relax.  Ah.  Watch a little.  I don't know.  I can't fucking find anything on TV.  Hence, you know, why I watch Roots and things like that. 
[00:42:00]  There's just nothing.  There's nothing on.  I fucking rally around those channels.  I got eight million.  Rally around the channels.  Rally around the channels.  I got eight million services for fucking movies, Amazon, Netflix, fucking.  Fios.  Kaleidoscape.  Kaleidoscope.  Kaleidos.  Right.  I got all kinds of shit.  And you spend hours going through it all. 
[00:42:30]  And then you realize, like, there's nothing on.  What's up with the movie channels?  They gave up.  HBO, Showtime.  They gave up on movies, by the way.  I was going to mention that at some point.  I went to the on-demand premium channels.  Right.  And you go to, like, HBO and The Movie Channel.  And all that.  Showtime.  They're not playing movies anymore.  Or the movies are who gives a fuck.  They're who give a fuck movies.  And the list is very short.  Like, they don't even have...  I guess they don't want to pay the rights to movies if no one's going to them for movies anymore. 
[00:43:00]  Like, HBO is all about original programming and documentaries now.  Which is great.  Which is great.  They figured it out.  Right.  But if you're a premium cable channel, depending on movies, you're fucking done.  I can't find kids' movies.  You'd think they would at least have kids' movies.  They have a section for that, though.  There's a section for kids' movies in the on-demand area.  That's not that great.  Well, on-demand.  Yeah.  You've got to pay the extra.  No, no, no.  I mean, the...  Which is fine.  With the premium channels and stuff. 
[00:43:30]  They're not that great, the kids' movies.  Yeah.  No, not really.  Some guy sent me, like, 20 to 30 kids' movies.  But your address on your envelope was so horrendous.  Your penmanship was so bad.  I don't even know how I got the envelope filled with the movies.  And I'm frustrated because I want to thank the guy because it was awesome what he did for me.  His fault.  Like, 20, 25 great kids' movies for the car.  Yeah.  And his...  I don't know who it was. 
[00:44:00]  His loss.  So now everyone on Twitter is going to go, that was me.  Yeah, it's me, please.  So if you're out there listening, I got your stuff, and thank you very much.  Yeah.  I'm a big fan of envelopes, and that was a nice one.  That was a nice, fat envelope.  Yeah.  With lots of movies to preoccupy the kids.  So I wind up, like, just playing fucking video games.  Yeah.  Because there's just nothing on.  I bought that goddamn Xbox Kinect Sports Rivals. 
[00:44:30]  What's that?  It's terrible.  Well, it's supposed to, you know, you use the Kinect, the Xbox One Kinect, so you don't have your control.  You know, you're just moving your body and stuff like that.  Right.  And control it.  And I just wanted to, like, you know, do a little of that Kinect bowling.  Because I remember, for the Xbox 360, their sports package with the bowling and stuff, it was pretty accurate and pretty fun.  Right, right.  And then I go to play it, and I just want to throw a little bowling, virtual bowling ball around. 
[00:45:00]  And you've got to go through all, because they made, like, a game of it.  Oh, God.  Don't make a game of it.  Let me just play what the fuck I want to play.  So I had to go through this goddamn jet ski fucking part first.  And I don't want to do that.  I just wanted to bowl.  Can you just bowl?  No.  No.  No.  You have to have an option where you can just bowl.  I swear to you, I couldn't just turn the game on and bowl. 
[00:45:30]  Why?  I had to go through the tutorial with this guy that's like, all right, now we're going to learn how to do the wakeboard jet ski thing.  Like, I don't want to do this.  And then I get out of it so I can try to find bowling or something.  And then I realize I can't, so I had to go through it again.  And he's like, all right, get ready, we're going to, it's like, it goes through the same thing and you can't get out of it.  So finally I was just like, Xbox, watch TV. 
[00:46:00]  And that was it.  And can't, I didn't even want to fucking deal with it anymore.  Did you have to play tennis?  I probably would have at some point.  And I don't like the rocket tennis ball.  I just want basic fucking games.  But why would you have to go through all of it just to play one particular sport?  Because they want to make a game of it.  They want to make it like.  That's fine.  With different levels in challenge.  I know.  But that's fine.  But they should have an option where, all right, I don't want to play it this way.  They should.  I just want to do the bowling section.  They should. 
[00:46:30]  So were you on one of these wave runners?  Yes.  Did he look silly?  I looked real silly in my living room.  Did he have to squat down?  No, I had to do this, like back and forth with my hands for the handlebars.  And then you squeeze your fist like this to work the throttle.  Right.  And then you lean forward or backwards to do tricks off the ramps.  Right.  And then you lean into the turns and you've got to go through the gates and stuff.  But I didn't care.  I didn't want to do that.  I just want to fucking bowl.  I just wanted to bowl a little bit. 
[00:47:00]  The Xbox 360 version was pretty good.  Pretty accurate.  But, um...  I'm looking at this as you were talking and Sam's got on.  I'm like, these are really good.  But, like, as years go on, like, we're going to look back at this the way we look at Atari.  And laugh.  Like, I can't wait until it's just real, like, real people doing it.  Right.  Or the other option is we're just at the end of everything.  It's not as good as it gets.  Right.  You think that's one of the options?  Like, ah, no.  200 years from now, it's the same thing.  It's as good as it gets.  Or we might be just pushing our limits, and this is just about it. 
[00:47:30]  That's about it.  I love when people say that.  Imagine what we're going to be doing with our phones in 10 years.  Maybe we've just about...  Maybe we've maxed it out.  Yeah, we've maxed all the technology out.  That is true.  The car is not that much different.  I mean, it's got some bells and whistles.  What's different about the car?  You can see where you're going when you back up now with the rearview camera, and your kids can watch TV.  That's about it.  It's all improvements on what they had already, and then little improvements. 
[00:48:00]  Like, yeah, the camera, that technology just made natural to put in a car.  Right.  But it's still an internal combustion engine for the most part.  You know, they've got the electric cars, but who's really using those?  It's still a piston-driven engine.  Right.  The brakes work the same way they have forever.  It's all, you know, the same one runs on gas.  You've got heated seats, GPS.  Right.  All the bells and whistles.  A few bells and whistles.  But for the most part, you step on that skinny pedal, you go faster. 
[00:48:30]  Right.  You step on the wider pedal, you stop.  I'm back up down the highway now with the camera just because it's fancy and I can do that.  I drive backwards.  Drive backwards with the camera.  Yeah.  Vocal commands would be cool.  Yeah.  They would just go 72 miles an hour, and your car just goes up to 72.  How great would that be?  Brake.  Brake harder.  That'd be good.  They can't trust people with voice commands in a car.  There's so much technology they could put in cars, but you're right.  The reason they're not in there is because you just can't trust people. 
[00:49:00]  I'm sure automated, completely automated cars would be available today.  Right.  You just can't trust people to fall asleep in the driver's seat and then, you know, have your car drive.  Because the person would fuck something up.  The machine's fine, but the person would fuck something up, not set something properly.  True.  True that.  And stop fucking around with my Xbox.  It turns on whenever you're talking.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  Oh, that thing. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  What is it again?  It's Xbox Watch TV.  Xbox, go-to Call of Duty ghosts.  Let's say hi to Scott in Detroit.  Scott.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Yeah, it's been fucking around with my Xbox all morning.  Xbox, sign out.  Xbox, put up nude photos of family.  Yeah, because if you turn on the radio, you guys would be fucking killing people left and right.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, I hear you.  That's weird.  Sometimes if I say I'm talking about the Xbox to somebody in the room, the Xbox decides I'm talking to it.  See, that seems like something they could improve on.  Yeah, maybe.  I don't know.  When it's command is Xbox, it's kind of hard.  But at the very least, why are you saying that is turning this guy's Xbox on in Detroit?  It's kind of funny.  You should recognize specific voices, don't you think?  At least start there.  Thanks, Scott. 
[00:50:30]  How's Detroit falling apart?  It's beautiful.  It's beautiful.  Depends where you live, right?  It certainly does.  Just stay away from downtown.  Stay away from downtown.  That city is rotting.  My God.  It's crazy.  It's gorgeous.  Gorgeous.  Gorgeous.  Gorgeous.  Sounds it.  All right.  All right, brother.  Let's say hi to Ken in Michigan.  Ken.  Hey, I wanted to tell you about the technology.  Did you guys see the new Land Rover where the hood becomes invisible when you're going up a hill? 
[00:51:00]  Oh.  What?  Yeah, like it's got some kind of a heads-up display, right?  Yeah, it's got a camera like in the front, and then it puts an image of the hill that you can't see over the top  on the windshield so you can, like, see right through.  Yeah, so you know where the hood would block your view if you're going up a hill and coming over the crest of a hill?  Right.  For a couple of seconds, you wouldn't know, like, what's there until you step on the brakes.  This superimposes the image from a camera on your windshield that would be looking through your hood. 
[00:51:30]  Wow.  So you can see what's over the hill before the front of your car comes back.  It saves you a tenth of a second.  Yes.  Do they have video of that?  I've got to see how that looks like.  Yeah, I saw something on the TV the other day.  Wow, that sounds pretty cool.  Yeah, so we're still getting a little technology.  We're not quite to the end yet.  Yeah, the camera stuff is pretty cool.  Yeah.  I think the heads-up display still, they draw lawsuits by too many people looking at it. 
[00:52:00]  Somebody would crash and say, I was looking at my heads-up display.  You have to press a button that says you accept all responsibility before that.  Yeah, probably like that.  You have to on your nav, right?  Yeah.  On your nav.  Yeah, you've got to do that.  I can't stand the fact that you can't work your nav if you're driving.  Mm-hmm.  Like, let the passenger do it.  Right.  They have a sensor in the passenger seat that says, like, that lets the car know if someone's sitting there.  Right.  For the airbags and the seatbelt and everything.  So have that, that the nav won't ask. 
[00:52:30]  Right.  Or won't cut you off if you have a passenger.  Right.  Because a lot of times, that's the part.  You're driving, you're fine, and the passenger's doing the nav shit.  Got to wait for a red light and then quickly get some more.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, fuck, I misspelled it.  Right.  I think on mine I can, actually.  You can?  Yeah, I think on some of them you can, some you can.  Well, nice death mobile you have there, Jimmy Norton.  They should give you the same amount of time you would take to change your radio station.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, okay, all right.  We'll give you, like, two seconds to try to do something. 
[00:53:00]  Give you a little bit.  A little bit.  Is that it?  Yeah, we're looking at it right now.  Oh, man.  All right.  It's going up the hill.  And yeah, you can see, it's almost like a reflection.  Wow.  You can see right through.  That's pretty cool.  Wait a minute.  I don't understand.  Yes, you can see right through.  It looks like you're watching a little image on your hood.  The hood doesn't totally go away.  Yeah, I don't understand that.  You're watching it on the hood.  No, it seems silly.  You can see your tires.  What?  This guy that made the video, why wouldn't he go up a really big hill?  That was a little hill.  That was a fucking tiny hill. 
[00:53:30]  Tiny hill, so it doesn't.  Tiny lift hill.  That's not that impressive.  You know what they have now, too?  And I know Mercedes has it, and I don't have a Mercedes, but they have these technology  where you can look through infrared on your screen, and you can see heat imaging.  So you can see somebody walking on the side of the street or in the shoulder of the road.  You can see the green thermal image, which is pretty cool.  Yeah.  I wish BMW had that.  That is handy.  You can tell if a deer is going to run out in front of you.  That's exactly it, yeah.  Or some drunk on the side of the road.  Yeah. 
[00:54:00]  Or black people.  Oh, Jesus.  They love to walk slowly across the street.  I think the people that get hit the most, especially in New York, are Asians.  Like, when Asians, like, for some reason, when I read a story of somebody getting hit by a car in New York,  it's usually an Asian guy.  Or woman.  Old Asian women.  But it seems to be black people that walk very slow in front of your car.  Oh, well, that's not if you're driving, though.  That's if you're stopped at a light.  I know what you're talking about.  Oh, no.  No.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Wow. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  I see in the crosswalk, if it's flashing the red light, like, it's going to be don't walk in a second.  Right.  And then it goes don't walk, and they're still in the crosswalk.  Oh, you'll get a saunter.  A saunter across the street and a look.  A saunter or two.  Yes.  There was a stabbing over a hunk.  Really?  A honky?  I want to say Brooklyn.  No, it was a lady driving with her son, and there was a guy walking slowly across the street.  They didn't say what race he was, but there was a hunk, and the guy looked and started yelling.  So then the son got out of the car, and the guy, yes, because the guy walking cut him with a razor or whatever he did. 
[00:55:00]  Of course he did.  Stabbed him.  Why get out of the car?  I don't know.  Unless he got a gun.  Right.  I don't know.  Never get out of the car.  That seems to be accurate, though.  I hope I don't get in trouble for saying that.  Oh, boy.  Nah.  What are you going to do?  Fucking chef was smarter to get out of the boat than to get out of those cars.  Fucking smart.  Get out of the boat.  Stay in the boat.  Greg in Texas.  Greg.  Oh, Greg.  Hey, how you doing?  Hello.  Just getting started, warming up a little bit. 
[00:55:30]  How are you?  Pretty good.  Good.  What do you got?  Xbox Kinect.  I've got one, and I keep it facing away.  It's sitting at the bottom of my TV facing towards me.  You know, I have, when you're standing up in front of you, it kind of bobs up and down.  Yeah.  What I'm talking about.  Uh-huh.  Well, one day I was watching television.  Xbox isn't even on.  The thing starts bobbing.  And so I keep it turned away from me now.  I keep it faced away, because apparently, Microsoft, government, or somebody can turn that thing 
[00:56:00]  on any time they want to.  So what are you doing that's so important and secretive?  I mean, if somebody wants to watch me sitting there watching TV, go for it.  It's a bit creepy, though, knowing that that's a possibility.  No, I know.  I'm kidding.  It's like, but I don't, you know, fucking point it away.  It's 1984.  Yeah.  The Kinect is watching you.  The Kinect is the whole 1984 angle there.  Exactly. 
[00:56:30]  Thank you, Greg.  You voluntarily put a camera in your house that connects to some fucking faraway thing  that can absolutely be controlled by them and, you know, watch you.  See, it is weird.  And let's say you could figure out how to look into everyone's homes through their Kinect.  Yeah.  You would see, you would have to go through a thousand homes to maybe see one thing that  might be halfway cool to check out.  Yeah.  You'd be bored quickly. 
[00:57:00]  The only good things that work are those little viruses that you can send out in an email  that if they click on it, it installs a program on your computer where you can then control  the person's computer.  So you can turn the camera on without it even looking like it's on so that, you know.  Are there viruses that do that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And they, uh, they've caught a bunch of guys that have used this to get nude pics of girls. 
[00:57:30]  They got their computers in their rooms and, uh, the laptops opened and they could just  turn the camera on without it even looking like the laptop's on.  How do they do that and override the light that's on a...  I don't know.  They fucking do it.  It's, it's all in their dumb little program.  Wow.  And they, they...  How do you know about this?  Uh, I have friends in the business, let's say.  Ah.  And, uh, yeah.  And, um, then they, they take video of them.  They take the video and then they blackmail them and say, I'm going to post this online 
[00:58:00]  unless you send me, uh, more naked pics.  Five million dollars.  No, they usually, they look for video, naked pics.  They look to, you know, like, get off my mind.  Well, why would the blackmail be send more of you naked?  That sounds crazy.  It's, it is crazy.  I don't know why you're doing that.  They gave some guy a lot of years in jail for that recently.  Yeah.  Some scumbag who was blackmailing girls or whatever.  Yeah.  He hacked their emails, though.  Yep.  And he went to jail for a long time.  Some guy got naked pictures of, um, Miss, uh, Teen something.  It was Miss Teen, one of those states.  And, uh, yeah, he got in trouble. 
[00:58:30]  Hmm.  Yeah, that's gotta be possible.  He wanted more naked pictures of her.  Right.  She told on him?  Yeah, she told on him.  Cool.  All right.  Let's say hi to Todd in Jersey.  Todd.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Uh, so, on Yahoo tech page, I think it was, I think the car maker, Peugeot, is making  a prototype of a car so that if you're stuck in traffic, a drone pops out of the roof of  your car, flies ahead, and gives you a camera look out of, like, where the traffic ends.  Oh, yeah, because that wouldn't cause a lot of accidents with drones falling in front 
[00:59:00]  of cars and bumping into each other.  Out in the, uh.  As everyone, yeah, sets their drone off.  Why not just have a giant periscope in your car?  Nice.  And that way you could lift it up and see further.  I think we've seen videos like that already.  For real.  I'm serious.  I think that was Larry David.  Oh, it was on Larry David.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Okay, you're right.  Uncurve your enthusiasm.  You're right.  That was a funny one.  Well, how about just one drone that we can all access?  You don't need, everyone has their own drone. 
[00:59:30]  Well, but then you need it, like, in every certain area.  Right.  Well, yeah, you have, like, cell phone towers.  You have a drone up way high so it can see X amount of miles, and it takes, like, almost  a satellite view, and in certain areas you access the cell towers, however, that we can  all see.  300 million drones.  I like the idea of just the traffic thing on your GPS because it works with, like, with  the traffic reports.  So you kind of know that you're going to be fucked. 
[01:00:00]  They pretty much got figured out on the GPS.  They got it figured out.  You know, yellow, red.  Red, green.  Green.  Some other them colors we got.  Gavin in Pennsylvania.  Gavin.  Yeah, hey, how's it going?  Hey, man.  Hey.  The new Mercedes S-Class is, they have a infrared camera on the front of their car that, at  night, it actually picks up images in the woods, like animals and all that shit, so  you don't run into cars and heads up display on your windshield.  Yeah, I was just saying that. 
[01:00:30]  It's like a thermal imaging, almost.  Yeah.  Yeah, that sounds cool.  Which is great.  Yeah, I was kind of hoping that all cars had that, but I guess that's exclusive to them.  Right.  What a brilliant technology.  That is a good one.  You don't really need it in the city as much, though.  Like, that's the one you need.  Like, if you live in, like, the backwoods or you're driving on a turnpike at two in the  morning, it helps.  Something alive is coming onto the road.  Yeah, it's more fighting for deer that really helps.  Yeah, they're just feeding right off the highway.  Yeah, the deer will fuck you up.  It's like, what are you doing?  Deer will fuck your car up, man.  Back into the wooded area. 
[01:01:00]  Like hitting a sack of cement.  All right, Gavin.  Thank you, buddy.  Yeah, no problem.  All right.  We got food.  Why don't we take a quick break here?  All right.  Just getting started.  Oh, man.  We got to do, yeah, the bad wheel of fortune player.  Oh, my God.  That guy is a gem.  Holy shit.  We got to talk about him a little bit.  Billy Crystal's on the news.  Oh, boy.  That looks sad.  A transgender woman's in the news.  Uh-oh.  Got the feds in Nevada. 
[01:01:30]  That was a good one.  Got a girl tweeting American Airlines.  Huh?  We got a very frustrated news reporter out of Minnesota.  Minnesota.  Oh, Chad.  What happened?  Well, we're going to find out.  Oh, I can't wait.  About a lot of these things after we eat.  Relax.  The Opie and Anthony show will be right back on Sirius XM.

[01:09:00]  I have a fun fact, too.  Yeah.  So the Spatial Endeavor, you know, the Spatial Endeavor, you know,  the part that the Spatial Endeavor was actually...  Wait, wait, wait, wait. The what?  Spatial Endeavor.  The, uh...  The Spatial Endeavor.  All right, wait. It's, uh...  Hold on. It's somewhere wrong with the phones.  Uh, Andrew, right?  Yes.  Um, Spatial Endeavor.  Um, that spacecraft was actually built to replace the Challenger and the... 
[01:09:30]  Something about the Challenger.  Andy!  I can't hear him.  What? You can't hear him either?  What ship, uh, was built to replace it?  Endeavor was built to replace Challenger.  Are we talking about... Uh, what are we talking about?  It's about Spatial Endeavor was built to replace Challenger,  and the parts that were used. 
[01:10:00]  The what Endeavor? I didn't hear that.  The Space Shuttle.  Yeah, but, uh, okay, but which one, bro?  You talking about...  Which one?  The first one, and then there's another one.  What, I keep...  All right, the phones are working.  Go ahead.  All right, you're going to have to start over.  Sorry.  Start over.  Sorry, Andrew.  Go ahead.  This sounds really interesting.  Um, the Space Shuttle Endeavor...  The show that replaced Challenger Endeavor  was actually built with spare parts  from the shuttle's Discovery and Atlantis. 
[01:10:30]  They were left over when they were finished built.  From what?  When they finished building both.  The Atlantis?  No, I said Space Shuttle Endeavor.  It's spare parts.  I mean, the parts that were used to build it.  Excuse me.  The parts that they used to build the Space Shuttle Endeavor  came from...  You said it again.  Yeah, it came from...  It came from Space Shuttle's Atlantis and Discovery.  It's because they finished building... 
[01:11:00]  They finished producing the Space Shuttle...  Excuse me.  Yes, yes.  Yeah, sorry.  I'm sorry.  I have a bad phone.  No, continue.  No, your phone's fine, dude.  It's a good phone.  That phone.  That thing was messing up, though.  So, wait, wait.  I don't understand, though.  You're saying the spare parts were used from Challenger?  No, excuse me.  I'm saying Space Shuttle Endeavor.  The material that was used to build Space Shuttle Endeavor...  What about the other space...  What's the Challenger?  Yeah.  So, that was built to replace it. 
[01:11:30]  Endeavor was built to replace Challenger.  And the spare parts...  I mean, all the parts that were used to make Endeavor  came from Discovery Atlantis...  Came from Discovery Atlantis  because they were finished...  They already finished building them.  And they stopped producing Space Shuttles after Atlantis.  Right.  And Atlantis was built in 1985.  So, then...  All right.  So, they took those spare parts and made what?  Endeavor replaced Challenger...  Wait, what's Endeavor?  Space Shuttle Endeavor. 
[01:12:00]  Right.  The material that they used...  Yeah.  ...to build Space Shuttle Endeavor...  ...were rational words...  ...from the Challenger...  ...from Discovery and Atlantis...  So, the Space Shuttle...  What did you say?  Endeavor?  Space Shuttle Endeavor.  Right.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you for that...  Well, it is fun fact Thursday.  ...you mush mouth.  We all learned something from Andrew in Brooklyn. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks, Andrew.  The Opie and Anthony Show is back.  Consumers XL.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Mop.  Cinnabons, huh?  Yeah, we were talking about Cinnabons.  Cinnabons, right.  Cinnabon.  In the airport, when you grab one of those things...  ...and you take that first bite...  ...it's... 
[01:13:00]  ...you just want to eat those for the rest of your life.  It's like, this is the greatest thing that's ever been made to put in your face.  And then by the third bite, you're like, this shit has to go in the garbage.  Yeah.  I cannot eat it.  I can't even look at it.  It's disgusting.  Just too sweet.  Very fast turnover on the Cinnabon when you're eating it.  Cinnabon.  We were talking about the Cronaut guy.  Yeah.  Because Roland's friends with the Cronaut guy, and he's back in business.  Is he?  I wouldn't know.  And the health people are up his nuts. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, there were nine health department people there the day he opened, making sure everything  was rat and mouseless.  I think Sam said that he should not be dealing with any of this stuff anymore.  No.  He should be outsourcing.  He should be in every airport right now with his Cronauts, and he should be at Costco and  all these different places.  What is he doing making...  I make seven a day.  He should be the figurehead guy, like the Wendy's, and you know how they have the guy, 
[01:14:00]  Sam Adams, things like that, that he could just walk around his mansion, drive his cars.  He's got the Cronaut fucking...  He's got the metal gate by his house that says Cronaut on it.  Of course.  That's how...  He should have nothing to do with putting his hands in the dough.  I've met Dominic a few times now, and he's the greatest guy, and his stuff is amazing.  It's over-the-top delicious.  It really is better than most things you're going to get in New York City, but he frustrates 
[01:14:30]  the hell out of me.  Just stop with this.  Today, I'm going to make 21.  21 Cronauts.  That's it.  That's it, huh?  What are you doing?  Yeah.  That should be in Costco.  Just boxes of it stacked up.  What do you need?  I need a case of Cronauts.  So many boxes stacked up that they're just throwing them in the dumpster in the back because  of the expiration date.  Yes.  You know what I mean?  Just gluttony.  There should be so many Cronauts.  There should be, on How It's Made, the Cronaut. 
[01:15:00]  Of course.  On that show, How It's Made, and just show these machines just spitting fucking Cronauts.  Cronauts flying out the other end.  Because in the end, he can make a lot more.  What is he doing?  Right.  What's he doing?  Nice conveyor belt where it's just...  Oh man, they're flying out.  And then a big tractor trailer full leaves the plant.  Get to see the packaging of the Cronauts.  Oh yeah. 
[01:15:30]  Bunch of Mexican people with hairnets on.  Right.  Fucking working it.  Right.  And he doesn't even know.  They're like, I haven't even been to all the Cronaut factories around the country.  But today I'm going to make 13 Cronauts.  Yeah.  Oh.  A special Cronaut today.  Oh, please.  You dunce.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  What is he doing?  As he watches every other store have their Cronauts.  They all have Cronauts and they're passing them by. 
[01:16:00]  I don't know.  He seems like a nice enough guy.  How much do you think he makes a year off the Cronauts?  Not a fraction of what he could be making.  It's nice to have a line, but...  Yeah.  You know.  Well, when I factor in my cost...  Right.  You know.  He's fucking got a little calculator.  Now he had to redo his entire place so those mice don't get back in there.  Batting down the hatches.  But we love him.  We love the Cronaut guy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Roland gets nervous when we talk about the Cronaut guy because he thinks we're bashing him. 
[01:16:30]  No.  We're not.  We're all in.  We're not the Cronaut guy.  Frustrated, but we're all in.  Yeah.  We support the guy.  Sell that off.  Because I really believe someone tried to do him in.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You got to sell that shit off like some kid with an app.  With a new app.  It's good.  It works.  Everybody gets its attention.  And then you find out, you know, well, Google's buying it for a billion dollars.  Exactly.  Like, what the fuck?  What?  I'm sure he's getting those phone calls.  Right? 
[01:17:00]  Costco's on.  I'm not interested.  No.  They're my Cronauts.  I want to just make 28 a day.  Oh, come on.  They're probably calling him every day.  What an opportunity.  He's fucking wasting.  Walmart's on.  No!  Tell him no!  I won't have my Cronauts.  As he has that squishy thing with his hunchback just slowly making.  Oh, making them one at a time. 
[01:17:30]  Very artistic.  With that love thing.  Putting love in each one.  Uh-oh.  You think Costco makes their stuff with love?  That machine knows no love.  That fucking Cronaut machine is spitting out Cronauts on Christmas Eve.  Right.  New Year's Eve.  It doesn't care what day it is.  If your hand gets stuck on the machine, there's just going to be some Cronauts with your fingers in them.  Right.  Nothing stops it.  That machine keeps a-rolling.  As he's just slowly mixing the ingredients in a bowl. 
[01:18:00]  Please.  Costco is just rocking it.  They should show some guy with a giant bag of, like, fucking powdered stuff.  Right.  Dumping it into a giant hopper.  Exactly.  With a big auger in there, and then he hits a valve and water shoots in it.  That's how it should be made.  Not this guy where he has a measuring cup.  A measuring cup.  Come on.  Just a little average-sized bowl.  I think I can make 17 this time around. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's great.  There should be pallets and hand trucks moving around.  Big barrels.  55-gallon drums of liquid.  In the last five minutes, as we've talked about this, companies like Costco just made thousands.  Thousands of them.  Thousands.  And how many did Cronaut guy make?  Is this guy's hand-picking eggs somewhere?  In a farm upstate.  What are you doing?  Fresh eggs.  Yes.  Oh, enough.  Comes up with the greatest dessert ever, and he's making, like, tens of thousands of dollars off it. 
[01:19:00]  That's it.  Letting it fly right past them.  Oh, God.  You've got to be exclusive for a while, and then let it take off.  Then you do your new thing, and then the lines will be for your new thing.  But you've got to know when to fucking go, okay, time to mass produce.  Sell.  Well, the Cronut.  It's time for the Cronut.  I agree.  Of course.  Obviously.  When all the other places have it.  Obviously.  You've got to have Cronut Man's Cronuts.  Right.  Like, you know, get the fucking name on there, and people will be like, oh, I'm not buying 
[01:19:30]  the regular Costco ones.  I'm buying Cronut Man's.  He's too busy taste testing different sugars.  It's sugar.  Let's go.  Different sugars from around the world.  Right.  Let's go.  Yes.  Oh, God.  Oh, enough of him.  Anyway.  Now I want a Cronut.  I went to Carvel last night.  Did they have Cronuts?  A Carvel Cronut. 
[01:20:00]  And then my...  Tom Carvel.  You know, I forgot that there's a Muslim in my family.  What?  Yeah.  Who's that?  So relax on the Muslims there.  Oh.  I forgot.  And his name's Osama.  No, it's...  Swear to God.  Great guy, sir.  Osama Hughes?  Great...  No.  Married in, you son of a bitch.  I don't want...  I don't want people to think there's a Muslim in this bloodline.  But, you know, someone might have married into that. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He's a very nice guy.  And his name really is Osama.  Osama.  I forgot all about this.  You'd think you'd change that, though.  It's hot in here, right?  Is that heat too much?  Yeah, we're trying to figure out the temperature.  It's...  You could knock it down a little.  I think they threw the A.C. on in here because it hits 70 degrees over the weekend.  Oh, that might be...  It was too cold.  Now it's too hot.  Yeah.  I think that's my fire.  Maybe just touch it down slightly.  The width of a human hair, if you move the little thing that much, it's crazy. 
[01:21:00]  I was called Nana because I was a little cold this morning.  You said, is it cold in here?  Maybe we turn the heat up.  Okay, Nana.  There is nothing funnier than calling someone Nana.  You were chilly.  That's all.  You were chill.  God, that ice cream was good last night.  Carvel, huh?  Yeah, I'm getting my shit back together, but I couldn't say no to a little Carvel.  I didn't realize that Carvel is up there game.  Have they?  I haven't been to a Carvel in at least 10 years. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Probably longer.  It was used to just be soft serve and a few saucers, right?  Saucers?  They had flying saucers.  Flying saucers.  And they had the chocolate bonnet and the cherry bonnet cones.  Yeah.  And the cakes.  No, man.  Now they got the whole...  Fudgey the wheel.  I had cookie dough.  Cookie dough?  They got all that ice cream now.  I didn't know that.  Like scoop ice cream?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Every flavor you could imagine.  I guess they figured...  I'll say it.  No, I guess they figured they had to do that to compete with what? 
[01:22:00]  Everybody else.  Baskin Robbins or something?  Right.  And it was amazing.  Because when they picked Carvel, there were three ice cream shops in the area.  I was visiting my brother.  Ooh.  And he picked Carvel.  I'm like, ugh.  Because I'm not a big soft...  Industrial ice cream.  I'm not a soft serve ice cream guy.  Yeah.  Are you?  I am.  I love Carvel vanilla cone with some fucking chocolate sprinkles on it.  I'm surprised about that part.  Oh, well, yeah. 
[01:22:30]  Well, it's much more white in there.  Yeah, that shit's great.  You like when it's coming out like it's coming out of your asshole?  It comes out like that later, too.  No, it's...  You can't let it sit.  That's for sure.  Carvel ice cream, the soft serve ice cream.  Once it starts melting, I don't know what it is.  It's not ice cream.  I know that.  I know that shit ain't no ice cream.  Right.  I don't know what it is, but it's pretty fucking good.  But it's delicious.  It's delicious.  What about these yogurt places where you put all your toppings on and what should cost $2.50? 
[01:23:00]  It's like, okay, this is $17.  This is $12.  Because you put all that stuff on it.  Yeah.  All the goodies.  They got a racket going.  Some Reese's Pieces and...  You get your frozen yogurt out of the machine and then you decide all the toppings you want.  Yeah.  Oh, they just kill you.  Let me weigh this thing.  Fat-free.  Yeah, fat-free with all the...  Fat-free.  And the toppings are...  Of course. 
[01:23:30]  What gets you.  That's good shit, though.  Yeah, I was surprised how good the Carvel was last night.  It was amazing.  Maybe it's just...  Well, you had the scoop stuff.  Maybe you just haven't had it in a while.  That happens with a lot of stuff.  You don't have it in a while and then you eat it.  It's like, wow, this is a lot better than I remember it.  It's like, well, maybe because you were eating it every day.  No, I thought I would have to go soft serve.  And I just...  Like I said, I don't like it.  I'm not a fan.  I love that shit.  I like where they have to just scoop it out and it's...  I don't like that.  They have to scrape the scoopers in the water and then it drips over their hand and then 
[01:24:00]  it drips into the fucking ice cream from their hand.  I can't take that.  You can't handle that?  No.  Really?  Yeah, like that scooper's dirty.  I love when they have to work it to get your scoop out of there.  They got that thing that looks like the murderer's feet.  That fucking guy in South Africa, Pistorius' feet.  And then they got a...  Murderer's feet.  Jesus.  The old, give me two murderers' feet worth of... 
[01:24:30]  You know what a funny bit on him was, uh...  Oh, Cat Williams had a fucking hilarious bit on Pistorius' feet.  Really?  Looking like backwards paperclips.  Yeah, it was a fucking great...  It's the only guy I've seen do a real bit on Oscar Pistorius' feet.  Yeah.  It was very funny.  That's, uh...  That's an interesting little story there.  When is that trial going to be over?  I don't know.  Pretty soon.  I mean, the judge gets to decide.  It's not a jury, so... 
[01:25:00]  You could take all that whining and crying he was doing on the stand and throw that out  the fucking window.  Yeah.  Over the weekend, I saw a lot of coverage on, uh...  Prince Harry, or is it...  William?  What's his name?  Uh, William is, uh...  The guy with the baby.  With the Kate?  With the Kate.  I was watching news clips, man.  What the fuck do they do?  Man, they walk around...  That's what I tweeted.  I said...  And be royal.  They walk around, and they nod.  They nod, they wave a little. 
[01:25:30]  They observe.  Yes.  And they shake hands, and then they move on.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's...  What the fuck do they do?  It's ridiculous.  And then you realize that we're...  We're...  We're known around the world now, because that tweet would have been just like a, you know,  a...  Yeah, I agree, motherfucker.  But all these English people attacked me, because I tweeted that.  Oh, shit.  That's their fucking boy.  They still take that stuff seriously, I guess.  I think they attach a lot of charities to their names and stuff like that, and causes  and things around the world, or attach to their names, so they seem to be very charitable. 
[01:26:00]  They don't do anything.  But I don't think they...  I don't think they personally do anything.  They travel.  They have to dress ridiculous.  Yeah.  Ridiculously nice.  They nod, observe, handshake, and move on.  They have to be very fucking, you know, nice.  And then, of course, someone is following that Prince William to, you know, sweep up  his hair as it falls off his head.  Oh, is he losing his hair at an alarming rate?  Wow. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, wow is right.  They also hate when we criticize their shit the way we hated when Piers Morgan criticized  America.  That's true.  If there's something about an American saying it, that probably annoys them more the way  Piers annoyed us.  We criticize our shit.  I'm just saying, that's what...  Well, I'm sure they criticize their royalty, too, but it's like, hey...  But why would they put up with that stuff?  Tourism makes a lot...  I think they probably think it makes more money than it costs.  Maybe.  It's so weird.  It's so ingrained in their way of life.  They walk onto a...  Way of life.  They walk into a room or a classroom or a factory or a playing field. 
[01:27:00]  Uh-huh.  And then there's the guy that just explains everything and they just, like, start nodding  and observing.  They just have to nod and look around.  Right.  They look around.  Oh, the right.  I see.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And then they, like, get on their knees to maybe shake a little kid's hand.  Oh, yeah.  And then they...  And then they just walk off to the next one.  And they're gone.  There's something about it this week.  It was really just driving me nuts.  Oh, shit.  Uh, let's say hi to Johnny in Atlanta. 
[01:27:30]  Johnny.  Hey, boy.  Go for Johnny.  Hello.  Yeah.  A good suggestion for a new flavor of Cronut.  It'll be the O&A flavor.  We call it the Jonestown Cronut.  It's infused with cyanide.  So you guys will quit talking about these fucking things.  Jesus.  Not already.  I don't know.  I thought we came up with a kind of a nice little bit about it.  Uh, you know.  I know.  Because, I mean, most people that are inventing things, they figure out how to mass produce 
[01:28:00]  it to, you know, get the payday.  Uh-huh.  And this Cronut guy is just not doing that.  Yeah.  Maybe he doesn't own the name Cronut.  Did he?  If he didn't fucking get that name.  Maybe that's the problem.  Maybe it would be a whole different thing if he tried to mass produce it.  I don't know.  He's like one of those artists, man.  He's got an artist mentality.  That's all.  I think it's literally just he has an artist mentality.  That's crazy, though.  And that's why he's such a good chef, because he has that crazy mentality. 
[01:28:30]  But it costs him money, probably.  But give up on the Cronut.  He's making new stuff all the time.  If you go down there, I'm telling you right now, there's stuff that tastes better than the  Cronut.  But the Cronut is the thing.  Because it's got the wacky name.  Right.  It has that name recognition thing, you know.  Right.  But instead, he's like, you know.  Taste testing creams from around the world and obsessing about getting his own milk made  by one particular farmer in upstate New York. 
[01:29:00]  Right, right.  You think some of these other places.  He's driving hours and hours away to farms.  Right.  This, um, no.  This cow got into an onion field.  What's that?  It's Napoleon Dynamite.  Let's go to San Francisco.  Chris.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just wanted to say that last caller is absolutely full of shit. 
[01:29:30]  Oh.  The Cronut stuff is really fucking funny.  Nice.  Thank you for it.  I'm just going to punch out.  Thank you, guys.  Wow, nice.  I was going to ask about the car tipping thing.  Is it still happening?  But he did hang up.  He hung up.  He did exactly what he was going to do.  He hung up.  Man, I had one of those fucking dreams last night where I was in a lot of trouble.  Right.  You know, we've talked about those.  Mm-hmm.  Apparently, years ago, and I had just been going through a lot, like, you think of these dreams, 
[01:30:00]  like, but apparently years ago, I had helped murder a couple of people and buried them.  Right.  One in one of my old friends from, like, the 80s, his yard.  Right.  And another one, apparently, in my own garage.  And, like, they were starting to ask questions around people that I knew.  They hadn't asked me yet.  And I'm just thinking, like, I am fucked.  Right.  I'm fucked.  They're going to figure out.  They're going to dig this up.  There's evidence.  And then I'm thinking back to the day of the murders. 
[01:30:30]  Mm-hmm.  And I'm like, what was I doing?  I think I destroyed some evidence and stuff.  I'm fucked.  I'm so fucked.  And then I wanted to, like, go where the body was buried in my garage and sniff around  to see if you could smell dead things.  Jesus.  But every time I tried to do it, this dumb old bag that was walking her dog kept peeking  in the garage.  And it's like, I can't now smell, because she'd be like, oh, yeah, he was smelling at his garage.  So you had to kill her, too. 
[01:31:00]  No.  No.  I just kind of, um, I just kind of, uh, was waiting for her to leave.  But then she didn't leave.  She leaned against something.  She's like, do you mind if I take my pills here?  I'm a bit woozy.  I was like, yeah, go ahead.  Now I'm thinking, fuck, I can't smell for the dead body, because this fucking bitch is taking  the pills in my garage.  I got to smell.  Well, that doesn't have any type of psychological implications.  No.  You sniffing around the garage where the bodies are buried, all your little deep secrets.  Is that what it is? 
[01:31:30]  Of course it is.  Are they my deep, dark secrets?  Yeah, so you're burying a body, of course.  It's in, like, this private, deep place and sniffing around for it.  But everyone has that dream.  I've never had a sniffing around the garage dream.  But that type of dream where you're worried about you're going to get caught or you're involved  with a crime.  Oh, when I woke up.  Because everyone has, I guess that means, you know, you're worried about your dark secrets  coming out.  But I think everyone has, like, secrets, darks, whatever.  That's why just about every person has that dream. 
[01:32:00]  It was, uh, when I fucking did wake up, though, I was like, oh, oh, oh, I didn't kill anyone.  It's the best feeling.  Oh, I'm not going to go to prison for murder.  This is great.  Oh, it was so creepy, though.  When you're in it, it's like, how did I not think about this for years, that there's bodies  buried and, and, uh, there was a murder.  Oh, terrible.  These dreams are fucked up.  And then it changed into another one where I was hanging out with this girl. 
[01:32:30]  She was supposed to come meet me.  And, and she was wrapped in cellophane.  She was wrapped in cellophane.  She's like, usually I only wrap my head and feet in cellophane.  But I figured I'd wrap my whole self up, and she smelled like piss because of the sweat  from the cellophane.  You could smell in your dreams?  Yeah.  I don't think I could smell in my dreams.  She smelled all pissy because she was sweating in the cellophane.  What the fuck am I doing?  I don't know, but I'm trying to figure out what could it mean when you, a girl smells like 
[01:33:00]  you're in because she's wrapped in cellophane.  Cellophane.  Certainly not a condom reference.  Yeah, right?  Uh-oh.  I don't know.  That's interesting.  It was pretty sick, though.  I'm sure we have some dream readers out there.  Aren't there always?  I had a horrible drunk dream, and I forgot about it until I was talking to Kenny at the  Diner.  I get those once in a while where in the dream, you're the same thing.  You're like, oh my God, I blew it.  Oh my God, I fucking blew it.  I can't believe I did it. 
[01:33:30]  And it's like being awake.  And then you wake up, and you're like, oh, thank God.  I better have a drink.  Yeah, exactly.  Calm down.  I just kicked the hook around.  Thank God I'm emotionally healthy.  Get out, madam, sir.  Whatever you are.  I have the smoking ones like that, too, where in a dream, I'm smoking, and then as I'm taking  a drag off a cigarette, I'm looking going, what the fuck are you doing?  Like all of a sudden, you realize what you're doing.  My go-to is that I didn't graduate college or something, or like I'm not going to get  it all together to graduate college. 
[01:34:00]  Well, that'll go away the further you get from college.  You're only what?  Two, three years.  I'm only, well, thank you for, you know, I know I look younger than I am, but it's about  10.  Oh, okay.  10 years out.  Yeah, yeah.  That'll go away.  What's that about?  Because in the end, it didn't matter I graduated from college.  Yeah.  I didn't really need the degree for what I went into, so.  We have, I did.  It's so weird, but it's like I'm missing finals, and then like teachers tell me you didn't get  this paper done.  I'm like, what? 
[01:34:30]  And then the panic of running around campus trying to get all this done.  I still have high school dreams.  It's like, can't I just sleep?  Yeah.  That means you're a last minute person.  Oh, yeah.  Because you're a very last minute guy, so maybe that's that panic.  Oh.  Of not being ready or not getting shit done.  You think?  Yeah.  I got taxes to pay still.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  It's today, right?  I don't know.  Today's the 14th.  Oh, I got another day.  I'm good.  I'm good.  Yeah, it's not tax day.  We'll do our big tax day show tomorrow.  Oh, we will. 
[01:35:00]  We're doing it from the post office.  Let's broadcast from the post office.  So we can talk to people that are getting in last minute.  Boy, what did you wait for?  We got a guy who's going to analyze your dreams, Ant.  Thanks.  Let's go to Oscar in Texas.  Oscar.  Oscar.  Hey, guys.  What happens in dreams is very common.  It's called, you know, real association from what's happening in your bedroom to what you're  seeing in your dream.  And usually if you smell this, it's because your cat Beavis has got his damp dick up your  nose. 
[01:35:30]  His damp dick up my nose.  I've never woken up with Beavis' damp dick up my nose.  So I don't think that's it.  Why are you smelling piss?  It was just in my dream.  I woke up and I didn't smell piss.  Maybe you had to go to the bathroom.  Maybe I had to take a piss.  Maybe you had to pee and your body was trying to...  You know, I did wake up at some point and take a piss.  But no one's answering the question.  I don't think you could smell in your dreams.  I could smell, definitely.  You could smell in your dreams?  I don't remember, but why not?  You're not really smelling.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Definitely.  Maybe you think you're smelling, but you're actually not smelling in your dreams. 
[01:36:00]  Maybe, but in the dream, it feels pretty real.  Yeah, yeah.  I was able to, you know...  All right.  There's so many set locations, too.  Like, I have sets.  Like, oh, I'm at this place again.  Or do you?  Or that.  It's like, oh...  Or was that the first time?  No, I remember different dreams from different times in the same place.  How do you know?  A lot of people say they dream the same thing over and over again at times, but maybe you're  just dreaming that for the first time.  Oh, shit.  That's fucked up.  How can you prove that you've been... 
[01:36:30]  Because I know.  There's one...  Are you sure?  That's like the elevator one, and I know that.  What's the elevator one?  It's an elevator in a building that it's all fucked up.  Like, you can't just go...  You gotta go take the stairs down to the first floor to get in the elevator from there,  and then it goes up, but it always passes the fucking floor I'm trying to get to.  Holy shit.  It's a pain-in-the-ass elevator.  I thought it was the microphone.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  Oh, is your mic stink?  What was it?  It's Jimmy's fart. 
[01:37:00]  I didn't fart.  You didn't?  No.  You didn't make it a face?  No.  No?  Oh, my God.  Smell that.  If you don't...  I don't smell it, you don't smell it.  Why is it hitting me first?  It's gonna hit you.  He definitely farted.  Look at his face.  No, I'm...  I don't know how I defend against it when I...  I mean, I'm laughing.  I'm not smelling anything, though.  I'm not either.  Jimmy, come on.  No.  You'll know if I fart.  He'll know first.  Or I'll know.  I usually pick up on him right away.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You farted.  No, I didn't.  Wow. 
[01:37:30]  It hit me...  No.  It went this way first.  Mm-mm.  It might be the microphone.  Sometimes Mars doesn't spread them.  No.  No?  No.  I mean, I will laugh if you keep pointing at me.  I know there's probably one coming.  Wow.  I got hit with something.  Man.  All right.  Anyway, sorry.  Elevator.  Yeah, that's about that.  But there's been so many dreams in that location.  Name another set.  Another set is...  Dream that you haven't dreamt about in a while. 
[01:38:00]  It's a house.  There's a certain house where there's a...  It's like a ranch house.  It's got a fireplace.  It's got a front and a back door with the windows.  And the windows, if I look out them...  Do you see the rising sun?  No.  I see...  There's always, like, bad people out there.  Oh.  Bad people trying to get in.  And my gun never works in dreams.  Never!  It's just fucking...  I have the wrong ammo.  The trigger won't pull. 
[01:38:30]  Or I got pulled trigger so hard that the fucking...  The bullet...  I'm not aiming properly.  Oh.  Kenny?  I used to have a dream like that, too.  And that's common for cops to have.  Is it?  Yeah, like, I'd be...  But I'm not a cop, you idiot.  Walking up the stairs in a project.  Yeah.  And the door would open, and the guy would be there with a shotgun, and I'd draw and pull  the trigger, and nothing happens.  Oh, that's like...  Oh, boy.  And when you wake up, because if you don't wake up, that means you get killed.  Oh, right. 
[01:39:00]  It's because it's...  Dream...  Sure.  You wake up, and you realize that you're at a place having your sperm tested, and you're  shooting blanks, yes.  Fear of impotence.  Yes, yes.  All right.  I just checked my Twitter.  Pretty Plus More on the Twitter.  I don't think you could smell in REM sleep.  That is why people die in fires.  I'm not talking about smelling in real life when you're asleep.  Oh, boy. 
[01:39:30]  I'm talking about you're in a dream.  Right.  And you can smell things that are happening in your dream.  That person is an idiot.  Yeah.  It's not what we meant.  Just adding it to the discussion.  Yeah.  But if you're in REM sleep, you can't smell?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I would assume...  Well, people do die in fires.  Sleep right through that smoke inhalation.  I don't know.  Now we've got to figure that one out.  How do we know that they die...  Oh, yeah. 
[01:40:00]  People find it in their bed.  Maybe they're just lazy.  Maybe.  Let's say hi to Joe in Connecticut.  Joe!  Hey.  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  What's up?  What else?  I had an excellent dream I wanted to...  Actually, I didn't have the dream.  I was sleeping with my girlfriend, and she had a dream that I cheated on her with another  girl from high school.  Oh.  And she woke up, and I fucking woke up to her fucking grabbing my dick, and we went at  it.  Oh.  So that was probably one of the best things I ever woke up to. 
[01:40:30]  It's very vulgar.  It is.  Yeah, we're trying to keep it a little cleaner.  Exactly, sir.  Thank you, sir.  We've got Steve, the therapist.  He wants to comment on Anthony's dreams.  That last caller?  Yeah.  I knew exactly what he was talking about.  Just kidding.  Anthony, I've been listening to you guys for a long time now, and there's a pattern that's  developed with the dreams that you find disturbing.  Oh.  The closer you guys get to your contract being up, the more your dreams bother you.  Oh. 
[01:41:00]  Now, what that means, only you could tell us, but...  I know what that means.  We're going to have a lot more time to sleep come October.  Oh, have you been graphing this, sir?  No, I just...  Charts.  I just listen to you guys very religiously.  But Anthony's dreams tend to go around either remembering the past, being a violent past,  or secrets coming out, or being afraid of being injured and not being able to protect  yourself. 
[01:41:30]  Like when you had that dream upstairs, and your mother was in danger, and you couldn't  help her, you were in the attic or whatever.  What?  You remember that one?  There was something happening, and you were looking at plates or bowls or whatever.  It was a whole weird...  Oh.  Which one was that?  I don't remember.  I find that Anthony's dreams generally project his thinly veiled, profound contempt for women.  Oh, yeah?  You have a lot of violent dreams, a lot of rape dreams.  No, not a lot of rape dreams.  You misunderstood what I said.  Maybe you just talked about it.  No, it's dream rape, but it doesn't happen a lot. 
[01:42:00]  But if it does happen, like if I realize that I'm dreaming, because a lot of times, not a  lot of times, sometimes, if I'm dreaming, I'll all of a sudden go like, holy shit, I'm dreaming,  but still be asleep and in the dream.  And then I'll be like, yeah, and just go on a rampage.  And I will grab any dream girl that's around me and just fucking rip her clothes off and stick it in her.  But you're a rarity, because as soon as you realize you're dreaming, and you're like, oh, wow, I'm dreaming, 
[01:42:30]  and this is a cool dream, as soon as you acknowledge that in some subconscious way,  it always changes your dream into something else.  Or you wake up.  How are you able to actually control it?  That's why I jump on it so fast, because I think if I'm going to do some slow finessing and, oh, let me do this,  the dream's either going to change or I'll wake up.  I panic and I go, oh, it's a dream, quick, rape.  I'm a goody two-shoes in my dreams.  No, you've got to be crazy. 
[01:43:00]  But how do you get to that point?  I don't know, it just happens.  How?  Because he has the same type of dreams, in spite of the fact he's saying he doesn't.  I've got the same morals in my dreams.  Bullshit.  Well, I do, too, if I don't know I'm dreaming.  If I don't know I'm dreaming, I've missed out on a lot of dream pussy by fucking being Mr. Goody Two-Shoes,  and then I wake up and go, why the fuck didn't you just fucking do it?  Right.  Because you didn't realize you were dreaming. 
[01:43:30]  I didn't realize I was dreaming.  I was trying to be a nice guy when I should just be rapey guy.  All right, Steve, that was great.  You really added a lot there.  Thank you.  For whatever it's worth, your type of dreams, same exact scenario for me.  Which ones?  Always like they discovered I was two credits short of graduating, and I got to go back and  take a class.  What a nerd dream.  Exactly.  I forgot.  I dropped my books on the water and couldn't read them over Christmas break.  What dorky dream.  I mean, I take Anthony's.  I raped everyone with a gun, and then wrapped her in cellophane and farted on her. 
[01:44:00]  Oh, yes.  Tinkled on her.  You think I'm enjoying these dreams?  It's boring as shit.  It's all slow motion.  You're trying to get to the pencil shrugger.  My pencil broke.  He only has a number three and a number one pencil for a test.  Thank you, madam.  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Jared in Jersey.  Jared.  Jared.  Hey, guys.  Hey, buddy.  I normally I side with Professor Anthony on the science-based question.  But I'm at the back opiate up here.  How do you explain that you can wake people up with smelling salt if they can't smell in 
[01:44:30]  their dreams?  Oh, yeah.  What's that about?  Maybe that's not a smell.  Maybe that's a pain because the receptors in the nose are being aggravated more than stimulated  by a scent or anything.  Good rebuttal.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  He's through that.  That's great.  Good rebuttal. 
[01:45:00]  He got caught with more info.  He did.  That's great.  That's funny.  Dan in New York.  Dan.  Hi, guys.  The man?  Yes, he is the man.  The man.  So there is a recent study that actually thinks that from an evolutionary perspective, dreaming  is the reason why we have our fight or flight instinct.  So while you're dreaming, you're running yourself through all these different scenarios and trying  to figure out a way out of them so that when it happens in real life, you have a response. 
[01:45:30]  It's like the training mission on a video game.  Ah.  There you go.  When we're cavemen, it's running away from bears.  When we're adults in the 21st century, it's, what if I didn't graduate college or what if  there's a lot of people outside my house?  Unless you live in a certain area of New York and it's still running away from bears.  Stupid, terrible joke that was.  I liked it.  I can't.  And they've done a study with...  Have the right spirit.  What, sir? 
[01:46:00]  They've done a study with mice where if they prevent them from dreaming, meaning they put  them on a little inner tube in the water and when they start to get into REM sleep, they  slip through and they wake themselves up so they don't dream for a couple days and then  they stick them in the middle of a field and normally when they would run away, they just  kind of stand around and do nothing.  They're probably tired.  Yeah, they're exhausted because they're still tired.  It forces them not to dream and not to sleep.  Right.  Because if they're falling through the little inner tube, that means they're not sleeping. 
[01:46:30]  A little tuckered out mice.  They don't want to do anything at that point.  Fall through the middle of a cronut.  Right.  Whoops.  They're going to go back to the drawing board with that study.  Yeah, I don't think that study's very good.  Exactly.  How do you know mice even dream?  Yeah.  Think about the types of dreams you're having and is it something that you're reacting to  in a negative way?  I mean, it's, you know, I think it has some validity to it.  I think if I've had the same type of dreams over and over for years and years and years,  I don't think it's any one situation that I could pinpoint. 
[01:47:00]  I think it's just a personality disorder.  That's what I think.  You're probably reacting to that situation differently each time.  No, I'm not.  It's the same fucking thing every time.  The same fucking thing.  The same cellophane-covered young lady smelling of tinkle.  Oh, my gosh.  And then I didn't want anybody to see her.  And there were a couple of people in a truck.  And I had a pickup truck for some reason.  I think because somebody called me a redneck on Twitter. 
[01:47:30]  And somebody said, well, Anthony doesn't have a pickup truck.  That's kind of weird.  And then I had to open the door and get her in there without them seeing her.  Right.  She was wrapped in cellophane.  But they could see right through the cellophane.  Oh, amazing.  So maybe that's what it is.  This fear of being discovered.  Or this fear of your secrets being uncovered.  But you feel like they're wrapped in cellophane and very, very visible.  And you can't cover them.  And then maybe the smell gives away, too.  She smelled of piss, though.  But that's a strong smell.  It gives it away.  Or you want to be a serial killer. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe that's it.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Or you're having sex with a girl whose last name is Saran.  Well, Jenny Hutt just tweeted me.  Oh, yeah?  Yay.  Dreams are your mind's way of trying to work something out.  That can be, yeah.  Everything in a dream represents something else inside of you.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think everything does.  I don't think it's the same fucking one in the same places.  I have, like, ten different dreams.  But they're all in the same places and same situations. 
[01:48:30]  I could fucking think, oh, there's one that's by this fucking store.  Like a deli or something.  Right.  And a parking lot and a house across the street from it.  And that's where I live.  And it's like, and they're the same places every time.  Thank you to that guy.  We're moving on to John in Jersey.  Johnny!  How you doing?  Ear and nose, Doc?  Yes, sir.  Am I right?  I just wanted to say that olfactory dreams are very uncommon.  However, olfactory nightmares do happen more often, usually, when you go in the bathroom after he rocks. 
[01:49:00]  Your phone dropped out, brother.  What's that?  Your phone dropped out.  What did you say?  That's all I had.  You said olfactory dreams and your phone dropped out.  Olfactory.  Yeah, but your phone dropped out.  What are you saying?  Yeah, we didn't hear your call.  He hung up.  Oh, he wasn't going to be party to that.  But is it not common to smell during, like, how about when you're awake? 
[01:49:30]  Does it, like, happen, like, when you're awake?  Oh, no.  Was the last one you...  No.  Really?  What the hell was that?  All right.  James in Ohio.  James.  Yeah.  We were discussing the smells and dreams and being in REM sleep.  My wife calls me all the time and tells me that the dogs woke her up from farting,  so I know you can smell while you're in deep sleep.  Oh, true.  So if I can get you up out there gagging... 
[01:50:00]  I guess my question was, do you actually smell in dreams themselves?  I don't know.  I believe that you can, or maybe you just think you do.  Wow, Jimmy.  Are you having a dream right now?  No.  It's a nightmare.  I think you're dreaming again.  A living nightmare.  Holy shit, it's coming right through the shirt and everything.  Wow, this is a very ill potente.  Holy shit.  Well, that's what happens.  You ask, I deliver.  Don't request them, and I won't give them. 
[01:50:30]  I don't think I requested anything right there, right?  You're begging for it.  He was asking for it.  I think we're too old to be farting in front of each other.  Not at all.  I just feel like that should have passed us by by now.  I know.  Maybe I'm a little emotionally immature.  What did you eat last night?  Yeah, what did you eat last night?  Are you pushing something out from your Tampa trip?  I had a wonderful Tampa trip, so there's no bad things.  The load in his ass.  Whoa!  Why do you think he said, sir?  This is the load in your ass.  You're fucking out without a load in your ass.  There's no load in my ass, sir. 
[01:51:00]  I'd be perfect.  Load in your ass.  Bird man, what's up?  What's going on?  Hey, you ever, guys, you ever dream when you hear a noise and you incorporate that in your dream?  Yeah.  The fucking train, I feel like every time I hear the train, I'm driving the fucking train right into a fucking building or something.  It's fucking weird, man.  Every time I hear the train.  So if that's, that is true.  So why don't we get some kind of like sound machine, right?  Yeah.  That goes off in the middle of the night, but it's like sex noises. 
[01:51:30]  So then your dreams are nice sex dreams.  Nice fucking sex dreams.  That's an experiment they should try to figure out.  But then the dream will be something horrible like you're fucking trapped to a chair and there's people like raping a loved one.  Right.  Like, oh no, this isn't.  This isn't working out like I wanted it to.  I don't like this dream.  But why not have some, if you, if you fart, I wake my wife up all the time when I blow a fucking nasty one in the bed and she wakes up and goes to your fucking ass.  I don't count a way.  It's probably loud though.  I woke up really mad one night because my wife was gagging and she, she said your farts. 
[01:52:00]  No, she said your God.  She said my farts were fucking horrendous.  Really bad?  But I'm mad because, you know, I was in a nice sleep.  Oh man.  Were you mad?  I'm with you.  Were you embarrassed that you farted?  I would be so proud of myself.  I was just annoyed that now I was awake.  How about when she rips them?  She doesn't rip.  I don't know when she rips.  Yeah.  They would probably all her and she's just playing you. 
[01:52:30]  My fucking sister rips some fucking bums.  Some fucking bums.  These women, I don't know when they, I don't know when they rip.  I don't know when they, you know, lay their hammers in the toilet.  Lay their hammers.  Oh shit.  You fucking guys make my days.  Thanks bird man.  Hey, let me come hang out with you guys up there one day.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I would like to see the bird man.  You've called our show for many years.  We'll set it up.  Hold on a line. 
[01:53:00]  Hold on a line, man.  Let's get the bird man a little visit.  Yeah.  All right, bird man.  Yeah, I call them hammers now.  Hammers?  Yep.  Lay some hammers.  Dropping the hammers.  My kid knows how to drop a solid hammer.  That is really disgusting.  Dropping a hammer is actually, there's something clean sounding about that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's solid.  It's out of the way.  It's out of the way.  Yeah.  You don't want to hear dropped a bunch of fucking stew with screws in it. 
[01:53:30]  Dropping a hammer is better.  When is Jimmy coming to Seattle?  He's coming in right now.  Oh, Jimmy.  I'm supposed to be doing a gig with Dave Attell, and we're probably going to hit Seattle.  I mean, Dave, we're going to do a few gigs together.  Washington.  Yeah.  I want to talk about dreams.  Dreams when you're throwing punches, but they do no damage.  Oh, that's like the old running dream where you try to run and you can't lift your legs  up.  Yeah, you try to punch and that doesn't fucking work.  A lot of dreams are just exhausting.  Yeah.  Whether you're in a road race or something and you just can't get it going. 
[01:54:00]  It's just something you can't.  You're chasing the bad guy, but you just can't quite get him or get out of his way.  It's the gun one, too.  It's like if you try to look for ammo in a dream for a gun, you'll never find the right  ammo.  Why are they exhausting, though?  That's a question for the experts.  Try to run.  It's like...  Everything is like cement.  Run your hands and knees, like trying to fucking get some traction.  Nothing.  Well, I actually had...  The running in place where nothing happens, for me, that was a memory. 
[01:54:30]  Because for a couple of years before I did comedy, I worked in a molasses factory.  And what happened is they would ring the bell for lunch and we would all run for the  door but get stuck in the molasses.  Why was molasses all over the floor?  We were not good employees.  It was a January strike.  Okay.  Now it makes complete sense.  I think we got one more worthwhile before we move on.  A lot of phone calls today.  Chris in New Hampshire.  Chris.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  So, especially...  I know right after 9-11, I had, like, all these terrorism dreams. 
[01:55:00]  And I tend to talk to him.  I sleep when I dream.  Not when I'm not dreaming, but just, you know, only when I dream.  And so, one particular one, I remember I was, like, in a cockpit of a plane and I'm screaming  at the terrorists, like, sounding all badass.  I'm, like, motherfuckers, I'm going to kill all of you bastards.  And just going crazy.  And my wife taps me and she's, like, wake up, wake up.  And I was, like, what's the matter?  She's, like, you're sitting there going, move, move, move, move, move. 
[01:55:30]  Like a complete retard.  And so, I've learned now that that's exactly what I sound like whenever I dream.  She safe recorded me a few times doing it.  So, you think you're actually saying stuff, but your real-life body is just going...  That's pretty funny.  Yeah.  And then, one other quick one.  So, apparently, my son has picked up...  My son has picked up...  Trying to double down.  Yep.  Go ahead.  Well, my kids picked up some crazy dreams, too.  And one night, my wife and I were sitting at the dining room table just chatting about something. 
[01:56:00]  My son comes flying out of his room, and he's about three.  And he jumps up on the couch, and he looks out the window, and he goes,  Where are all the chickens?  And I guess he thought there were chickens all over the front yard, so...  From a dream.  Yep.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  Yep.  He broke even.  Yep.  We saw that coming a mile away.  He broke even.  It's like, when you bet, you win, and then you bet it all again, and you lose...  Just walk away.  He broke even.  He did. 
[01:56:30]  Chickens.  And now we lost our momentum, so now we just take a break.  I had a very weird nightmare, a dream, actually, recently.  That Chip Ruins the Mood had over a million views.  Oh, my God.  Could you believe that?  I don't know what happened, but now it was on the front page of Reddit again.  This wasn't a dream, Jimmy.  E-bombs world.  Yep.  And break.  I don't know why this amazing video pops up once in a while.  It had a resurgence again.  Where's the rest of that footage from that ride?  That was in Cleveland.  Yeah.  You've got to find that, because there's probably more nonsense on there. 
[01:57:00]  I took it with my phone, so it wasn't really...  It was whatever clips I did.  Oh.  Yeah, there wasn't like a lot of footage.  Oh, you weren't...  That's right.  Okay.  Yeah, I was just doing it with my phone.  That one is so good.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, wait a minute.  I like when you go, wait, wait a minute.  And someone's talking, so you just kind of hunker down and wait.  Let's play it.  It's so fucking good.  Oh, it's so fucking good.  That's a great audio bit as well.  You guys are what?  I have...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Sorry.  Another hit. 
[01:57:30]  But Cleveland, you've got a driver taking you to the hotel, right?  Yes.  Going to the hotel.  Talking about...  Having some fun.  Kenny and just talking about being married.  And I'm over the top laughing at what the driver's saying, because, you know, he's just...  He's the driver.  He's doing a shtick.  He does his shtick.  Chip.  Oh, Chip.  And Chip ruins the mood.  Yeah, yeah.  Thus Wyatt's title, Chip Ruins the Mood.  I have my wife convinced that I'm deaf, but I never listen to anything she says. 
[01:58:00]  That's funny, Bob.  I have my wife convinced that I'm her husband.  Yeah.  I've never been married, but my wife...  How's that going for you?  Not good.  No, wait, wait.  She probably was going to do all the work around the house.  I was going to get married once, but I couldn't, because she was sick with cancer.  See, that's Chip.  That's tough. 
[01:58:30]  Very industrial.  Very industrial.  Very industrial.  Oh, is that so fucking uncomfortable?  Wait, wait, wait a minute.  I like how you want to get in there with it.  It's such a good one.  Oh, my gosh.  Remember when we were playing the World Star Hip Hop comments?  Yeah.  And one of them comments, because only me and Kenny you could see, and what did the  guys say?  All those niggas look like birds? 
[01:59:00]  Me and Kenny.  Yeah, but when it was on World Star Hip Hop, the comments were great.  Yeah.  It pops up once.  I was just surprised someone tweeted me it was on Farm Pressure Road.  Oh, yeah.  It went everywhere again this weekend.  Yeah.  That's awesome.  Mikey and Baltimore.  Mike.  Hey, fellas.  This one will scare the shit out of you.  I had a buddy who learned how to be a lucid dreamer.  Hold on.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  My friend learned how to be a lucid dreamer as a kid, because he had nightmares that kept  him up every night, so his sleep specialist taught him how to do it. 
[01:59:30]  So, like a moron, I tried to do it myself just based on what he learned.  The problem I had, though, is I would feel like I was wide awake.  Like, my eyes are open.  I'm looking in my bedroom.  Yeah, I couldn't move for a minute.  Yeah, I have that, too.  I've heard people that have had that.  I've had that many, many times over the years.  Hundreds of times.  Many thousands.  Yeah, you try to scream.  You try to move.  You just can't do it.  It feels like an hour, but it's probably like two minutes.  It's that REM sleep thing, I think.  Sorry, but I think that that's the way your body protects you from hurting yourself in 
[02:00:00]  your dreams.  It is.  Like, you can't move because that way you don't injure yourself while you're dreaming.  Yeah.  Thanks, buddy.  I'm punching out.  Great job.  But that has happened to you, Jimmy?  I can't tell you how many times I've woken up and felt like I know I'm like, it's like  a weird, like, that's what it feels like.  Like, my whole body is buzzing, silently buzzing, and I can't move, and I can't do anything.  And I'm trapped.  And it's a very real feeling moment. 
[02:00:30]  Like, if I think of myself falling out of a plane, I'll feel the wind.  It'll be an extremely lucid moment.  But then I come out of it.  Wow.  That's just waking up, I think.  Oh, man.  Nothing beats that falling in a dream feeling.  What?  You get all fucked up.  What is that?  Holy shit.  Like, I've been driving, you're driving a car, and you're going really much too fast for  the road, and then you fly off a cliff, and that feeling you get when you're just like,  oh, shit, I'm fucking falling. 
[02:01:00]  Right.  Then you've got to wake up before you hit or you die.  Or you're really dead.  I don't know if that's bullshit, by the way.  Steve, the therapist, is back.  Oh.  I'm better than ever.  I'm back.  Jimmy's absolutely right.  When you enter a certain level of sleep and you're dreaming, your brain releases a chemical  that, in effect, paralyzes you, obviously, except for your breathing, so you don't act  out your dreams.  That's why, in many of your dreams, you feel like you can't run, you can't fight back, 
[02:01:30]  you can't change after the bad guy, that type of thing.  What chemical does it release?  I wonder if that's tied into central sleep apnea.  I don't know the name of the chemical offhand.  Oh.  Wow.  Let's see.  So we're all paralyzed at some time during our sleep?  Except for essential functions, yes.  I like that.  That's a little weird.  Well, how come if you wake up, how come if you wake up, then you can move?  Yeah.  It's that instant that it goes away? 
[02:02:00]  It depends on the stage of sleep that you wake up in.  I think everybody could probably remember waking up and it taking a second or two before  they're able to move.  The anecdote...  Then how are we hitting our alarm clocks?  Yeah.  Well, if you've got this paralysis, your alarm goes off, everyone hits it, hits that snooze  quickly.  Yeah.  Well, it's the level of sleep you're waking up in.  But what if you're waking up in the middle of fucking this chemical thing? 
[02:02:30]  With all the people that set alarm clocks, you've got to think a percentage of those people  would not be able to hit their snooze alarm because they still have that paralysis.  Comment?  Well, it's the question...  There's also the question of how long is the alarm clock going on before they wake  up.  Oh, come on.  I won an award for fastest alarm shutter offer.  Ooh.  Where is it?  Hanging up on the wall?  Yes.  It's just an alarm clock with a hand on it.  Made of solid gold.  That would rule. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm thinking...  You're with me on this one, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there'd be a lot of people going, fuck, I can't hit that snooze alarm.  Oh, it wears off instantly?  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't buy that.  I think that's some kind of bullshit.  Yeah, I say nerds.  And then how come you can't roll over?  You know, you roll over in your sleep.  You fucking...  How about we get Dr. Steve on the phone?  Grab the pillow and fucking...  Bite it.  Bite it.  Let's do a little Dr. Steve after the break. 
[02:03:30]  You know what?  Dr. Steve knows everything.  You're right.  All right.  And video of the fart king.  I don't know what that means.  Video of me?  I guess.  Tom and Tucson, stay through the break if you can.  We'll talk to you.  Relax.  The Opie and Anthony show will be right back on Sirius XM.

[02:16:30]  Coachella.  First of all, that Coachella looks like the worst fucking place to be.  Oh my god.  I know I'm way, way out of the demo.  If Opie's nana, the grandpa is complaining about the kids' music.  Way out of the demo.  Yeah, who's at Coachella this year?  What do we got?  We've got all Twitter pictures there.  I saw the lineup and was like, what the fuck?  I know Fatboy Slim.  That's about it.  Jared Leto was talking at the MTV Movie Awards last night about wanting to head back to Coachella.  Yeah, I saw that little segment. 
[02:17:00]  How were the awards?  Were they good?  No.  I mean, even I'm out of the demo at this point.  Outcast, Mews, Arcade Fire.  Okay.  I mean, Outcast was the big one.  Right.  Because, you know.  Yeah, Mews, Arcade Fire, Queen of the Stone Age, Skrillex, Pharrell, Lorde, Foster the  People, MGMT.  Wait.  Pet Shop Boys.  Pet Shop Boys.  Kid Cudi.  Western Town, those guys.  Nas.  Eastern, Western.  I think so.  Right.  MGMT.  Nice.  Beck. 
[02:17:30]  Whatever happened to MGMT?  Motorhead.  Calvin Harris.  Answer my question.  I think that...  It faded away a little bit.  Yeah, I think EDM kind of took off and kind of left MGMT behind.  A lot of letters.  Motorhead was a Coachella?  Where do you see that?  Oh, yeah.  Yep.  Lana Del Rey.  A lot of good bands.  Why are the band names getting smaller and smaller?  They're less important.  Maybe I was looking at the other stages. 
[02:18:00]  Because, man, it just looked like a fucking collection of shit.  Oh, you got back.  Bunch of stupid hipsters.  You like the back rap?  Yeah, to a point.  Mm-hmm.  You ever hear that Loser song?  I heard that one.  What are you implying?  It's a big song.  Oh.  Is that your Loser band?  Is that the one?  Yeah.  You know what I heard over the weekend?  Mm-hmm.  Tom Petty. 
[02:18:30]  You're jamming me.  Right.  And it's like, what did Joe Piscopo ever do to deserve to be in that song?  Take back Joe Piscopo!  Maybe he was a fucking psychic.  I don't know.  That's a very good question.  Yeah.  What the fuck did Joe Piscopo ever do to deserve to be in that?  We've got to ask Joe Piscopo about that song next time he comes in here.  Yeah, I remember, guys.  Guys.  He did that.  But it's cool.  He's a great guy. 
[02:19:00]  Roland, get Joe Piscopo on the phone.  No!  Let's do it today.  Yeah, I want to find out.  Yeah, we haven't talked to Joe in a while.  He put that in the song, and it was at the same time me and Eddie.  It was like Eddie was in the song, too.  Oh, God.  That's a fucking good Piscopo.  That's a really good Piscopo.  I love Joe Piscopo.  That's very good.  Take back Joe Piscopo.  Take back Eddie Murphy.  Give him all some place to go. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, Eddie Murphy's in that song, too?  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Wait, is it over at Coachella, or is it still happening?  No, it's just this weekend.  It's coming?  No, it's already over now.  Then they do it again.  It's done skiing.  Then they do it again when?  They do it twice now.  They do it twice.  So next weekend, it's again.  Did Motorhead play or no?  Yes, Motorhead played last night.  Yeah.  Oh, they did.  Okay.  But they're going to play again next week.  It's the exact same lineup.  Same lineup.  Twice?  Next week.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah, because it sells out so fast.  Why not do it?  So they all have to go back there?  That's right.  Where is it?  It's in California. 
[02:20:00]  It's in the desert.  Yeah.  Oh, hold on a minute.  People know why Piscopo's in that song.  Let's say hi to Gil, it looks like, in Atlanta.  No, it's Bill.  But anyways.  Oh, Gil!  Look how it's Bill.  I know.  All right.  Anyways, Petty said that he opened up a Washington Post style section, and on the cover of that,  on the front page of that was Piscopo Murphy and somebody else, and that's why he needed 
[02:20:30]  some names to put in that song, and that was the first thing he saw.  And then Murphy, Eddie Murphy had a big shit fit about it and said that he was pissed off  at Petty for using his name.  Was he bashing him or no?  Well, it kind of was.  Well, he's naming a bunch of stuff in the song that is like bullshit, kind of pop culture  crap.  And so with the same Piscopo and Eddie Murphy, I could see that pissing him off.  What do you think he is?  Yeah.  Eddie Murphy was at some press conference, and they asked him about that, and his response 
[02:21:00]  was, I don't give a shit what Petty says.  I don't listen to his music because I'm black.  I think he called him something, too, like some buck-toothed fucking hillbilly or some  shit.  Well, let's hear that part of the song.  Right?  Where is your jamming me?  Your jamming me.  All right, guys.  Punching out.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Take back your pension pain.  Remember this?  Take back your ups and downs of your life in the razor's land. 
[02:21:30]  Take back Vanessa Redgrave.  Take back Joe Piscopo.  Vanessa Redgrave and Joe Piscopo.  Oh, take them back?  Place to go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, he's just...  You're jamming me.  I don't know what that meant.  I mean, like, you're bullshitting me, you're fucking me, you're fucking with me. 
[02:22:00]  Little known fact.  Yeah.  Without Tom Petty, there wouldn't be Jay-Z.  What?  That is a fact, my friend.  How so?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I'm not going to explain it to you.  That is true.  Nick in Syracuse.  Nick.  What?  Huh?  You.  Hey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, what's up, Nick?  What do you got?  Yep.  Hey.  Nick?  Jimmy was talking about the sleep paralysis.  Yeah.  This guy on Art Bell's show for, like, whatever, however long he was on Sirius, this one guy, 
[02:22:30]  Dr. Albert Taylor, came on and talked about how, like, that happened to him all the time,  and he was able to, apparently, he could be full of shit, but he said that he used that  state to, like, have out-of-body experiences and shit, and he, like, went out and did an  experiment.  Like, he went to one place and looked at him.  Isn't it like a gum?  Yeah.  Exactly like that.  But, yeah, I don't know.  Apparently, like, he said it's possible and shit.  Like, you could, he ended up, he was afraid of it at first, then he, like, used it to do 
[02:23:00]  all kinds of crazy shit with it, go to different dimensions and all that.  So, I was wondering if Jimmy ever did that or if he ever was doing that.  No, and neither did he.  You know, it's just, you feel like you can rise out of your body, though.  I understand why someone would say it feels like that, but it's, no, you don't have out-of-body  experience.  I swear to you, when I was younger, living with my parents, early teens, maybe, I swear, I  have this, this, I felt like I left my body and walked into the bathroom. 
[02:23:30]  Were you comfortably numb?  Is that it?  There is no pain, no?  No, I, but I have a memory that I've, I feel like that absolutely happened.  Huh.  But I don't, I don't know how to explain it.  Was I just dreaming?  Could have been a dream.  I felt like I went to the bathroom, but not with my body.  How do you explain that?  Did you piss yourself?  You were just dreaming.  Yeah, maybe you were just dreaming. 
[02:24:00]  Just a dream.  Yeah.  Especially when you're a kid, you don't even get the fucking, what the dream is, so you think  it's real?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Sure.  Sure you do.  You was just dreaming.  I remember that, Gregorio.  You thought I went to the bathroom.  I was like, no, you're just not used to that pressure in your hiding.  That was my finger.  He doesn't even try to be subtle.  I know.  No, I was helping him.  I was taking his temperature.  Oh, okay.  He had a fever.  As long as you're helping. 
[02:24:30]  Your head was warm.  Yeah.  So I wet my finger and I put it in your bottom.  I said, let me see how warm you are there, Gregorio.  Oh.  Your little feet was kicking in your PJs like you were swimming.  It's horrible.  This isn't fun anymore.  That would be a quick question.  When you took that out-of-body shit, were you able to smell it?  Like you guys were talking about smelling a dream?  I don't even remember if I took a leak or any of that stuff.  I just have this memory from when I was a child that I've kept with me for many, many 
[02:25:00]  years where I truly felt like I left my body and for whatever reason walked into the bathroom.  And I'm sure it was probably, you know, just a dream or whatever, but to my...  There's no way to know.  I mean, it could be true, though.  Who knows?  And I always thought to myself over the years, wow, I really would like to do that again.  It was cool.  I remember one dream that I had when I was fucking like five years old.  And it was when Casper the Friendly Ghost took a shit. 
[02:25:30]  I was hanging out with Casper the Friendly Ghost, and he took a shit on the sidewalk.  And I was like, Casper went to the bathroom.  And you remember this from being five?  I remember it.  It was like, it's definitely the first dream I ever remember having.  And I remembered it for so long because I thought it was the funniest thing.  As I got older, I kind of remembered it.  And I was like, I remember like Casper taking a shit.  Casper the Friendly Ghost.  Did Casper have a bunch of friends that looked like him when they were on horseback? 
[02:26:00]  Let's go to Mark on Long Island.  Thank you for that other call there.  Marky!  Yeah, what's going on?  Hey, man.  I'm in the clinic.  Yeah, in college, I used to take Adderall.  And that shit would cause a lot of sleep paralysis.  And I would take it to study.  And I would see myself from across the room and I would take naps in the study hall.  It was weird. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, you're probably just thinking you saw yourself.  Yeah.  All right.  Punching out.  Dreams will weird you out.  Right.  That's what it is.  Yeah, exactly.  I think a lot of people, when they have these spiritual awakenings and after death experiences,  experiences, but then they come back, I think that's all some kind of a dream state thing.  You know, once you start crossing wires in your head, you could, you know, it can make  you believe anything.  You could see things, hear things, smell things. 
[02:27:00]  You're in certain places where you're not.  You confuse your memory of things with the actual reality of where you are now.  So it could fucking short circuit all kinds of shit up there when you got stress going  on.  Just made up of a lot of goo and some electric currents.  We're a goopy machine.  It's a goo machine.  Instead of metal and wires and everything, it's all goopy stuff, but it works the same  way.  Bishop in Chicago.  Bishop!  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  I've had the sleep paralysis probably five or six times in my life. 
[02:27:30]  It's the weirdest thing.  You just wake up, you cannot move your eyes, you can't control your breathing, you can't  scream, you can't move, and then what happens to me is I just basically get in such a panic  I pass back out.  And then wake up covered in sweat.  You pass out?  Yeah.  It's just like such a panic feeling, then it just all goes black, and then you wake back  up, and every time it's happened, I've been just covered in sweat, and it's not a fun  thing. 
[02:28:00]  Wow.  That is really strange.  Okay.  We're getting no answers to any of this stuff, by the way.  No, because there really aren't any.  Where's our experts?  There's a lot of theories as far as dreams go.  I understand that.  When I was a kid, it was probably just a dream, but I remember it being that I really, truly  felt I left my body and walked into the bathroom.  I fucked up.  So just explain that.  You can't just say, well, it's a dream, but why is it a dream to the point where you really  believe you actually did that?  Yeah. 
[02:28:30]  That's what I'm trying to figure out.  I never forgot that one.  It's one of the only things I really, truly remember as far as dreams and things like that  go.  I had a fever as a kid, and I remember being a little delirious and thinking that I was  doing certain things, you know, walking around when I wasn't.  Did your hands swell up like two balloons?  Yes.  You want to learn how to control your dreams?  Sure.  Dave in Pennsylvania.  Dave. 
[02:29:00]  Hi.  Nick Fanny, guys.  Hey.  A local college here was in the newspaper a year or two ago.  They developed these special glasses.  Penn State.  It developed these glasses with like a light in them, and they claim that like when you  were in REM sleep, like if you were dreaming you were in a field, like the sky would like  blink, like it would be that light.  And they said with training, you could participate in your dreams. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Could be all bullshit, but...  No, I think you can, because there are certain times you realize you're dreaming and then you  can do things, but you're right at the brink of waking up, which is the bad part, and I  think that's the only reason you can control them, is because you're so close to waking  up, because every time I do get into a point where I'm controlling a dream or I know I'm  dreaming, so I start doing other things like flying around or something like that, then  I wake up.  You just got to stay cool?  Stay cool.  I always blow it.  I'm like, whoa, I'm dreaming and this girl's naked over here. 
[02:30:00]  The next thing you know, it's like butterflies in a fucking field somewhere.  Oh, it's terrible.  I panic.  So what do you do?  You just stay cool?  You're like, okay, I'm dreaming.  Oh, I'm dreaming.  I'm dreaming.  That girl over there is naked.  Now what do I do?  What do I do?  What do I do?  I'll stop walking over there and she turns into a dog.  Yeah, good.  Now you fucked up.  You got to stay cool, right?  Yeah.  Do you tiptoe over to her?  I think so.  You edge your way over real slowly. 
[02:30:30]  Hello?  Hello, baby.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Let's move on because these phone calls are all the same shit.  Oh, no, I didn't mean you.  I thought we were gone.  Sorry, Dave.  They're all shit.  I don't hold the little fuckers for a while.  He's right there.  Do-do-do-do-do.  I got a good out-of-body experience story.  It's better than these retards on the phone.  All right, we got to take this one.  Another Dan the Man. 
[02:31:00]  Dan.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I took, back in the 90s, I took like two big fat tabs of ecstasy and a huge line  of K, and I was floating out-of-body for about five minutes until I came back down, and I  was sitting on a couch, and I fucking, I don't know, it was the craziest thing ever.  I don't know.  Out-of-body experiences are definitely a real thing.  You know, you prefaced your call with, I got a good out-of-body experience story. 
[02:31:30]  It's better than these retards on the phone.  Yeah.  And your story is to the point of, I don't know.  I got a little nervous.  I got a little nervous.  Okay.  Oh, you got a little nervous.  Fair enough.  I'm still fucked up from last night.  You got a lot of nervous.  Yeah, all right.  Fair enough.  That was nothing.  But that's drug-induced.  Fair enough, guys.  Well, sorts of things could happen when you're on drugs, right?  Yeah, that's not.  Just a dream, you silly.  Right.  All right.  Dummies.  Can we see the Wheel of Fortune guy?  Yeah, that guy.  Talk about a nightmare. 
[02:32:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  No kidding.  Like that tie-in there?  I liked it.  No.  This guy is an idiot.  He's giving you another opportunity.  Let's spin, Pat.  All right.  Wow.  Hits the million.  L.  Yeah.  Four L's.  Pick that up.  Turn it over.  Lay it down right over that one.  He has a million dollar thing.  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  And he's got all the letters.  So he's got all the letters. 
[02:32:30]  It's right there.  All he's got to do is read it.  Yeah.  He's just got to solve.  It's mythological hero Achilles.  Right.  Yeah, there's no letters covered.  That would be a good idea, yeah.  Mythological hero Achilles.  How much would he have won?  I don't know.  He doesn't get the million dollars.  But he gets the shot at a million.  Not at a million, which, you know. 
[02:33:00]  Achilles.  Wait, can he go back?  What a stupid man.  You're a stupid, stupid man.  Achilles heel.  When the woman next to him solves it and he's just standing there, his face is, he is so lost.  Oh, I love it.  That would be a good idea, yeah.  Mythological hero Achilles.  I can't accept that.  Okay.  I'll check.  I'll solve. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Mythological hero Achilles.  Yeah, that's it.  Oh, boy.  Well.  His face.  Well, when it comes to names and.  He's just lost.  Even though the letters are up there.  They're just ignoring him, too.  It's great.  This is what you did.  You have to say it.  And she won a thousand dollars.  A thousand bucks.  She had no money.  She had nothing.  What?  Because she didn't get to spin it all.  Because he kept spinning and picking all the letters.  What a dope.  Do you think they're going to make fun of him back at Indiana?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:34:00]  That wasn't the only.  No, that wasn't his only faux pas.  Oh, no.  There's another.  Oh, yeah.  And you said it.  You get a thousand dollars, which is a house minimum.  So you have a thousand.  But we'll just.  They gave her the house minimum.  The house minimum.  Because she hadn't spun at all.  Oh.  She's like, I guess I'll solve and just read the.  Yeah, he took up the whole game.  And then just.  Oh.  Achilles.  Achilles.  What a dummy.  A dummy.  W.  There's a W.  Pick up that half car.  He's getting all the fucking good spins, too. 
[02:34:30]  He got half a car.  And then he spins and gets the other half.  There's an L.  Pick it up.  Solve it and get a car.  Wow.  Solve it and get a car.  Same guy.  And he's going to make up.  Same guy.  He's going to make up for where he flubbed.  And it's going to be a happy ending.  And look at the smile on his face.  He's got it this time.  Wait, hold on.  Pause real quick.  I want to see what the letters are that's left.  I can't see what's left.  It'll show you.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Because he's still gone.  Yeah.  The world's fastest blank, A blank. 
[02:35:00]  And he said C?  He said C.  Yeah.  But the clue is person.  Oh, okay, yeah.  So it's definitely not.  Maybe he thought it was the world's fastest cad.  So it says the world's fastest.  And we're looking for a person.  Blank, A blank.  It's man without the M and the N.  Yeah, of course.  He thought it was car.  With the clue is person. 
[02:35:30]  The world's fastest cow.  Maybe it was a Ripken reference, he thought.  Yeah, maybe.  And so then it's going to go back to the girl again.  And it couldn't be car because there's already an R on the board.  Right.  In world.  So he really fucked this up.  He stinks at this.  He's terrible.  The world's fastest man.  Yeah, that's it.  And again, the same face.  How funny would it be if he just right hooked her?  He just punches her in the face.  And she had nothing on the board again.  She just gets her minimum thousand dollars.  Oh.  Unfortunately, he screwed up again. 
[02:36:00]  Again.  In the game, yeah.  He screwed up a third time.  And this is all one show.  Right.  Let's solve.  Okay, Jim.  He's going to solve.  He's going to solve this.  The, uh, hold on.  In the on-the-spot decision.  Oh, very good.  On-the-spot dice spin.  Dice spin?  Is he doing this on purpose?  I'm spinning around and around. 
[02:36:30]  He's the dumbest man alive.  Dice spin.  What's so great is he might be the greatest wheel spinner.  Yes.  That the show's ever had.  Right.  But the dumbest man.  Dice spin.  You don't even spin dice.  You roll dice.  On-the-spot?  On-the-spot.  On-the-spot dice spin.  Oh, no.  God.  On-the-spot dice spin.  So the blonde looks at him.  You see how the blonde girl looked at him? 
[02:37:00]  Her head whips around.  She goes, like, you've got to be shitting me.  Not again.  And then the brunette's like, how come I have to be on this side of the retard?  Yes.  Oh, my.  And his excitement is the best.  Oh, he's so psyched to get the winning answer.  He's like, finally.  All right, I missed out on the million dollars.  I missed out on the car.  But I'm going to get my $7,500 for this on-the-spot dice spin.  Oh, God.  Play it out.  Shelby?  On-the-spot decision.  Yeah, that's it. 
[02:37:30]  He looks again.  He did it again.  Is he doing that on purpose?  Why would he?  I don't know.  To be in a viral video.  But why would he give up a million dollars in a car and then $7,500?  A chance at a car.  I mean, a chance at a million dollars.  He would have definitely got the car, right?  Yeah, because he got the two halves of the car.  He definitely had the car.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  And it's not like he's making any money off the viral video.  It's just people who watch it on TV.  Right.  That's true.  Oh, he just looks like a moron.  He does look stupid. 
[02:38:00]  He really does look stupid.  Hey, I didn't have time to prep for this dice spin.  Dice spin.  Let's do it on the spot.  On the spot.  And we got an angry guy on the line.  What?  Go ahead, angry guy.  You dumb, fucking uneducated cunts.  Look up this shit before you just play it on YouTube.  Do some show prep.  Uh-huh.  He's an Ethiopian man.  English is his second language.  He's not the best at figuring out all the letters and all the words.  Ha, ha, ha.  Then don't play the fucking games.  He got into the University of Indiana. 
[02:38:30]  He's on Wheel of Fortune 2.  He's on a fine university.  University of Indiana.  You can be bored somewhere else.  Jim, you're bored in fucking England, you dumb fucker.  Maybe he's hungry then.  Yeah.  Maybe he's just hungry and he couldn't pronounce it.  Being Ethiopian and all.  I just think it's hilarious.  That's fair.  No, that's fair.  I take it back.  Thank you.  All right.  He's a dope.  The guy's a dope.  He's a moron.  He's an idiot.  This guy also had a trip to London and blew that?  Why isn't that part of the video?  I don't know.  Let me go to Greg.  Greg. 
[02:39:00]  Hello, Greg.  How are you?  I'm doing good.  Yeah.  No.  Right before he landed on a million, he landed on a trip to London.  He blew a trip to London.  I guess he's not going on that.  And it's been for a million dollars.  What a fucking fool.  How did he blow the trip to London?  Oh.  Maybe he had, in the first spin, maybe he had the million dollars and the trip to London.  Oh, and the trip to London.  Both on the board.  Oh, right.  Okay, I gotcha.  Yeah, and then the chick just got a thousand bucks for it.  Look at her look of surprise and shock that the man is this dumb. 
[02:39:30]  Right.  His stupidity astounds her, as it should.  There's never been such fortunate placement for a game show contestant as that chick next to that guy.  Right.  Right.  Let's go to Dave in Iowa.  Dave.  Hey, Dave.  That's a great video, by the way.  Yeah.  Doing very well.  We'll put it on our Facebook page in case you haven't seen it.  Go ahead, Dave.  Yeah, you've been talking about all this dream stuff.  My four-year-old keeps telling me he sees my dad at night.  He died a few years ago, but he was like only three months old when he only met him for the first time. 
[02:40:00]  Is he Haley Joel Osmond?  Yeah, no, we've done this break before.  I'm sure the parents are going to start calling now.  So, this gets really fucking creepy.  Remember we read that list a while back?  Things creepy kids say?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we had a whole bunch of calls from parents going, I'm telling you, man.  Yeah.  This is what happened to us.  Right.  Right.  I'm waiting for that day in my house.  So far, we're good.  So far, we're good. 
[02:40:30]  My two-year-old, we moved in a new house.  My two-year-old, he's just now learned how to wave.  And the other night, he was waving at somebody in the house.  And I just chalked it up as being two years old, but a little weird.  Yeah.  Yay.  We was waving at each other.  Hi.  You hear about the little kid came out of his bedroom, looked out the window, and said,  where are all the chickens?  Very scary.  Very scary.  Very nice call, right?  I wish that guy would call.  Yeah.  Yeah?  No. 
[02:41:00]  Let's look at the Minnesota video as well.  This is our video segment.  Because that one's really good, too.  And I'm going to clear the lines, because I'm sure the parents will be calling with their  creepy shit now.  Apparently, when he lost a million dollars, the girl next to him laughed.  Of course she would laugh.  Yeah.  On Wheel of Fortune.  Yeah.  Terrific news for her.  Yeah.  She gets a thousand bucks.  Yeah.  She gets a fat G.  Score.  All right.  What do we got going on in Minneapolis?  Well...  The party's over.  What's this clip about?  Basically, the hockey team for this college in Minnesota lost the NCAA championship. 
[02:41:30]  Right.  And so they decided to get drunk and riot the way white people do.  Okay.  Which means just be generally uproarious.  Right.  And then when an Asian news anchor tries to do his report...  Oh, boy.  ...just completely harass him like no one's been harassed before.  Oh, no.  But why would he be annoyed at this?  Because they keep, like, shoving him and stuff.  But he went into a tough assignment. 
[02:42:00]  What do you expect from these people?  They say, what's your fucking problem, man?  I also like that the news anchors at the desk, like, he keeps saying, if you listen, he'll  keep saying, I gotta send it back to you, and they keep going back to him.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  I'm loving that he's out there.  Yes.  Have you seen this?  No.  Oh, it's great.  They're normal service revolvers that they use in crowd situations like this.  Let's go back to Jonathan.  It looks like he's got something there that he wants to tell us about.  Jonathan, go ahead.  Tim, we're hearing shots right now. 
[02:42:30]  I don't think they're gunning.  It sounds like colored guns right now.  A lot of people moving down the street.  Running down the street.  We saw another group of students running out this way.  And they keep reaching for his arms and stuff.  What was the guy saying?  Did he say fucking something?  Yeah, if you listen, they're just cursing up all the time.  This is great.  They just wander into the camera and stare into the lens.  This should happen every day.  We're bringing back our assault on the media finally, right?  Just don't fucking touch anybody.  We've got to get the Hawk doing a few more of those.  Absolutely. 
[02:43:00]  Just show how it's so good.  Show people how it's done.  Yeah, just show them how it's done.  Woo, cronuts!  And then runs out of steam and he has tiny fists.  His little dumb arms like a midget and he walks off camera ashamed.  Meanwhile, there's an 11-minute live shot happening somewhere else.  And he's texting through it.  What a clod.  Wrong place, wrong time.  Absolutely.  Daily dollar choice.  All right.  Listen to the, uh, listen, now listen to the people.  Yeah.  Close about.  Jonathan, go ahead.  Tim, we're hearing shots right now. 
[02:43:30]  I don't think they're gunned.  I think that it sounds like pellet guns right now.  A lot of people moving down the, running down the street.  We saw another group of students run down this way.  We're not sure.  Get off me.  Tim, I got to send it back to you live.  A lot of people here drunk right now running down the street.  We fucking won.  This is a, and that's the news reporter going, get off me.  We fucking won.  Get off me.  We're not sure.  Get off me.  I got to send it back to you live.  A lot of people here drunk right now running down the street. 
[02:44:00]  This is a chaotic scene.  I got to send it back to you this year.  Yeah, no worries, Jonathan.  No worries.  No worries.  We're going to take you back up to Sky Fox now as you see two squad cars heading west  down the fourth.  All of you who went to the U know that is a very...  They're going to go ahead and go back to John.  John's probably like, okay, I got it back.  Come back to me.  And look at these kids already.  They're waiting.  All revved up.  To pounce.  They're not, you can tell that they're leaving him alone.  And then the minute he starts talking, they all just go over. 
[02:44:30]  Popular place.  He's there live right now.  Jonathan, set the scene for us.  You've got officers walking past you.  Tim, look at the riot police right now.  They are moving on 13th Avenue trying to get students out of the streets.  Again, after the game, people, the students inside the bar seem to be leaving in an orderly  fashion.  But then we started to see people running.  The guy's flicking his tongue like he's licking.  The riot police out here in full force coming out of teams building walls right now.  Tim, I got to send it back to you. 
[02:45:00]  You see them all grabbing by the shoulder and jumping up and down.  Jumping up and down with their hands on the guy's shoulders.  He's just being annoying.  He's there fucking all cranky.  He is so annoyed right now.  The one guy's mimicking eating pussy.  Yeah.  Like his tongue.  And then not only are they behind him, but they're jumping in front of him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the worst thing that's happened to this man.  That's great.  Every time we turn the camera on, we've just got a lot of idiots getting in our way.  So if we have anything new, we'll get it back to you.  What did he say? 
[02:45:30]  Something about pussy.  It was something about pussy.  And you miss it as the clip goes on.  That one guy is still just pretending to eat pussy.  He's doing the tongue between his fingers pussy lick.  And the reporters just spend the whole time pushing.  He's in a fucking riot.  Did you hear him call them idiots?  Yeah.  Every time these idiots keep shooting.  Idiots.  Yeah.  And then someone said pussy.  I want to hear it.  Every time we turn the camera on, we've just got a lot of idiots getting in our way. 
[02:46:00]  So if we have anything new, we'll get it back to you.  Fuck her right in the pussy.  He says fuck her right in the pussy.  Wait, one more time so I can hear that.  No way.  Holy shit, yes.  Idiots getting in our way.  So if we have anything new, we'll get it back to you.  No doubt about it.  Fuck her right in the pussy.  Absolutely.  He felt compelled to get the fuck her right in her pussy.  Helpful advice.  Oh, that's great.  Wow.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Oh, my God.  What a bunch of drunks. 
[02:46:30]  I love it.  Those are two great videos today.  And now someone's saying the Wheel of Fortune guy ended up winning in the end.  He won something.  He's a fucking idiot.  I saw the video clip.  He is an idiot, but he did win.  He's a fucking idiot.  He lost two trips.  The guy on Wheel of Fortune actually lost two trips.  He was the greatest spinner.  Why is it getting worse and worse?  Steve, Chicago.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  He actually, that was the second trip he lost because that was a prize puzzle where the  world's fastest man was actually from is where he was going to on the prize puzzle. 
[02:47:00]  So that would have been the second trip of that round alone that he lost.  Ah, okay.  I have my kid.  He fucked up.  Yeah.  He was serious.  Suffice to say.  Yeah.  It was horrible.  Thank you, sir.  Even if he was from, even if he was from wherever the other guy said, he had still no excuse when  he's going to like this.  Of course.  Ethiopia.  Oh, look at this.  He's just a fucking idiot.  Evolution.  Oh, no.  Bob Saget.  It says, Evolution of Bob Saget, Family Man to Filthy Comedian. 
[02:47:30]  What do you call yourselves?  The aristocrats.  After a family has done something you don't want to do.  Bob, you've been known for years.  But it's not right.  Family Man to Filthy Comedian.  He was Filthy Comedian that went into.  Right.  Family Man.  That Family Man thing in the sitcoms.  Making him do the aristocrats joke again.  No.  Yeah, let's let them.  In theaters.  I didn't know it was going to be in theaters.  I had a daughter going.  My oldest daughter, who is in this book. 
[02:48:00]  And she's been in my book signings.  And she's beautiful.  And she said, I'm going into the theater now, Dad.  So watch the aristocrats.  I remember it was a nightmare.  I said, no, don't go.  Love you.  It's full.  Bye.  So it was an interesting time where people went, you know, he's got a foul mouth.  But I've been doing stand-up since I was 17, trying to get a job.  And I was always probably not as blue as I was after that defining moment.  I was also one entourage at the same time.  So there's these two. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, people see.  They don't know.  Got to get the word out that he's not the guy from that TV show.  He's a dirty guy.  People now know that.  I know.  Mainstream media, I guess they don't.  Let's say hi to Dave in Minnesota.  He wants to add a little more to that video we just played here of the TV reporter getting just harassed.  Dave.  Yeah, you got to look like halfway through the video, you'll see one guy walking past the reporter, fucking with him. 
[02:49:00]  And then there's a line of cops that just come out of nowhere and he spots them.  And he's like a deer in headlights.  And he just bolts at the other direction.  Oh, really?  We did see when the cops showed up.  Yeah.  They weren't really fucking with him as much.  Oh, it's great.  I love those.  I love all of those.  Yeah, fucking videos are great when the reporters lose it.  That riot was just a bunch of drunk kids, but the news made it seem like it was some crazy, dangerous, life-threatening situation.  Mike in Minneapolis.  Yeah.  Seemed like it was all right. 
[02:49:30]  In a lot of those cities, the cops have all the riot gear and all the fun stuff, but they never get to use it.  Yeah, they want to break it in a little bit.  So if there's a gathering of people committing shenanigans, you've got to put on the helmet and get the fucking clubs out in the shields and start racking a few heads.  Breaking in your new gloves.  Right, right.  Breaking in the new gloves.  For spring.  And it gives you a few fun stories to tell in the locker room.  Sure.  Things like that.  Let's go to Sandra in Cincinnati. 
[02:50:00]  Hi.  Whose birthday is it today?  What?  Oh, boy.  Cincinnati.  Big star.  Coming out of Cincinnati.  March shot.  March shot's birthday.  Nope.  I don't give a shit about baseball.  Pete Rose, 73.  Pete Rose, come on.  Pete Rose is 73 today.  What do you got there, Sandra?  Well, when my grandma died about a year ago, about a week after she died, my daughter was playing on my phone, 
[02:50:30]  and she said that she was talking to grandma, and that she said that she loved her and wasn't sick anymore because she had cancer.  And I just was like, whatever.  It's probably just she's repeating what we told her.  Uh-huh.  Well, about a week later, we had dinner with my other family and my niece, who's about the same age as my daughter.  She was like, yeah, I talked to grandma on the phone the other day, and she said that she wasn't sick anymore and that she loved us.  And I was just like, holy shit.  Well, grandma got a new repertoire. 
[02:51:00]  Exactly.  Telling the kids all the same shit.  Grandma's on board.  Right.  A redundant board.  That's the Twilight Zone.  I remember that one.  That was the one with the kid, Billy Moomy, there from Lost in Space.  His grandmother died, and he kept getting phone calls from her, and the grandmother was trying to get him to kill himself.  What?  So he would be with the grandmother.  Sure.  And the father and mother are like, what the fuck?  Knock it off. 
[02:51:30]  So then the kid, he does it.  He jumps into the fountain out back and drowns himself.  And he's laying on the ground, and they're like, oh, we can't get, you know, the EMT guys are like, oh, we can't get him back to life.  And then the father gets on the phone, the little toy phone, and so it's going, Mom, please, please don't take our boy.  He has such a long life.  And then you hear, oh, my God.  And the kid comes back to life because the father was, like, pleading with his mother to not fucking take the kid.  That show was brilliant.  That show is great. 
[02:52:00]  It holds up, too.  It absolutely does.  You can still watch those, and it's just as chilling or fucking captivating to watch.  I love it.  Thank you, Sandra.  Thank you.  Have a good one.  We got a therapist.  He's going to explain why children can speak to dead relatives.  His name is Gorilla Bob, and he's calling from the Jersey Turnpike.  Gorilla Bob.  Hall.  Yeah, hello, boys.  I'm a therapist.  I know why children can see or babies really can see all of those dead relatives. 
[02:52:30]  Oh.  Yes.  We're eagerly awaiting.  I'm not explaining it to you.  Oh, what?  That's Obie's new bit.  I'm the new bit guy.  Remember with Beck?  Goodbye, boys.  What the fuck?  That was like a bad edit of six phone calls.  Yes.  But I don't understand.  I don't either.  New bit guy.  He's not going to tell us? 
[02:53:00]  Is he the guy that calls up and says, I know this, but then doesn't tell us?  Is that his character now?  I think I said that one time.  Yeah?  Oh, maybe.  Maybe he ran with it.  I guess.  All right.  Jim on Long Island.  Jim.  Right here.  What's up, boys?  Hey, buddy.  Hello.  Hey, man.  You there?  Oh, yeah.  We're here waiting.  Yeah.  Listen.  So the other day, my two-year-old nephew, he's in the crib, and all of a sudden, I hear  him going, Tattletail, Castor Earl. 
[02:53:30]  Way to go, Uncle Paul.  Yeah, I called him on the phone.  Oh, I make ghost noises.  I saw on Twitter over the weekend that the Long Island Medium was trending.  Really?  So I kind of clicked on the trend to see what that was all about.  And it was all these, mostly women, I got to be honest with you, were completely losing  their shit over watching the Long Island Medium.  Well, what was she doing, talking to dead people, which has been disproven by everybody? 
[02:54:00]  Well, but they love suing people that say just that, for whatever reason.  Well, that say what?  Who told us to be careful with that, Penn?  Oh, Penn, you just can't call them liars.  You can't say liar or fraud.  But you could say, you know, I don't believe that bullshit.  Yeah.  But who's still buying into that?  And you could say, I'm sure a few of my family members, I should shut up.  People who are very hopeful.  I've never seen people that have definitively proven that they talk to dead people. 
[02:54:30]  And I've seen a lot of people who have definitively disproven.  Like, Penn is brilliant when it comes to that shit.  And how they do it.  It's amazing.  But, I mean, like, just how she gets vague information and people are still holding  out hope.  It's like, why does she have vague signals coming from the beyond?  You know what the greatest thing for these people has been?  The fucking internet. 
[02:55:00]  If you have an appointment, if someone calls you with an appointment to fucking have a  reading done about your dead relative, and you just Google their name, or go deeper.  Fuck Google.  It's a business expense at that point.  You go into their records, find up their files.  Ancestry.com.  Ancestry with their death records.  Yeah, exactly.  Ancestry.  You know, shit like that.  You could get so much information.  Anyone could seem like an amazing psychic.  Yeah, you would absolutely blow someone's mind.  Yep.  But to still believe. 
[02:55:30]  And when she's like, I'm thinking of the way he's kind of highway.  I think he's trying to say, it starts with an S.  Yep.  And everyone just stares so she knows, okay, it's not an S.  It's not an S.  Well, no, no, not an S.  Wait, wait.  It's an S in the name.  A P.  And then she sees someone, like, jump up a little bit.  Ah, yeah.  And people still buy into that shit.  John Edwards shit on his TV show.  He used to make people fill out stuff.  Right.  They didn't show that part.  Go to Twitter and put in Long Island Medium as, I think that was the hashtag. 
[02:56:00]  You've got to read some of these tweets.  Yeah.  People are, they lose their minds over her.  Yeah.  They're dopes.  They deserve what they get.  They deserve what they get.  They're dopes, right?  They're fucking dopes and they deserve what they get.  There was only one good medium.  Her name was Raya.  Yes.  And I remember telling her once, well done, medium Raya.  We heard you.  I think she spelled out Long Island, by the way. 
[02:56:30]  We heard you.  Loud and clear.  Yeah.  It's really bad.  It's your face, though.  You're hurting today.  You're hurting.  I like to pick up a nice raw steak with both hands and slap your face as hard as I can.  Smack me across my sunburned face.  With a nice raw steak.  Yeah, if you're tuning in, it's face is like beet red.  It's supposed to.  It's calmed down a little bit the last couple hours.  It's supposed to be like 74 today and sunny, so I'm going to be out by the pool again. 
[02:57:00]  Nice.  But I'm going to put a little lotion on this time.  Or something that resembles a lotion.  It's something that resembles a lotion.  So your tussles don't get burned.  Did you see my picture that I tweeted of Mr. Brady from one of the episodes?  No.  When did you tweet it?  Apparently, yesterday.  Oh, I saw.  Apparently, Mr. Brady, in one episode, was wearing an apron.  Right.  And he was cooking something.  And then Jan was doing her spastic tap dancing.  Right.  And she knocked into what he was cooking, which was some batter stuff.  And it hit the floor and sprayed up on him. 
[02:57:30]  So he's standing there in an apron, looking down with this white, creamy stuff all over his shirt.  And your tweet was just nice.  I just put it.  Foreshadowing or something.  Foreshadowing for my question, Mark.  Because he had cum on him.  Sam, read some of these.  Start with that plain Jane one I see.  In the red.  Down here?  Right there.  Start with that one.  If I could meet anyone, it would be Teresa Caputo. 
[02:58:00]  I freaking love her.  She is amazing.  Hashtag Long Island Medium.  I honestly think she changes lives.  This person is dumb.  I mean, in all fairness, she might change people's lives.  But it's all, in my opinion, complete bullshit.  She's not talking to any dead people.  This person says, I get some people think hashtag Long Island Medium is fake.  Regardless, the thing she does for people is amazing.  They need what she gives them.  This person says, hashtag Long Island Medium. 
[02:58:30]  I love you, Teresa.  I'm your number one fan.  I wish you can tell my grandma that I love her and miss her so much.  Thanks.  God bless you.  Well, you just did.  She's got Twitter.  If it's heaven, it's got to have everything, right?  Of course.  So grandma's got Twitter.  Don't worry about it.  This episode of hashtag Long Island Medium is hitting too close to home.  First time I ever cried this way watching something on TV.  Oh, God.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what I'm saying. 
[02:59:00]  Because I believe in what she's putting forward.  How does she sleep at night, do you think?  They're just dopes.  People are dopes.  She probably just says, well, you know, I know it's entertainment.  Or maybe she says, I'm helping people.  Yeah, she probably spins in her head like, well, I know that I don't actually have these powers.  But in the end, I think I'm helping them get over this.  It amazes me that people don't know that these powers don't exist.  It's amazing to me that there are people that believe shit like this. 
[02:59:30]  People are stupid.  You can tell when you watch videos that people post.  Check this out.  It's amazing.  And you look and go, no.  A plane can't land with one wing.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Let's go, R.C.  R.C. in Indiana.  The home of that Wheel of Fortune dope.  Yeah, that Wheel of Fortune dope.  It's fucked up.  I went to IU for a little bit.  So, you know, Tom Crane's embarrassing our basketball team bad enough. 
[03:00:00]  He's talking through a tire tube or something.  Yeah, what are you talking through?  I'm talking through a cellular phone.  Sounds bad.  No, it really sounds bad, for real.  It's a cellular phone.  Well, I'm actually traveling to North Carolina right now.  All right, drive safe.  Be good.  God bless.  He says, but you were at a John Edwards reading, and it was pretty fucked up.  What made it so fucked up?  The fact that he knew that I called my grandma Nana. 
[03:00:30]  Which, you know, I heard you guys say earlier than me.  He knew you called your grandma Nana.  Really?  What a great cold read that is.  Nana, Grammy, Nana.  I'm getting something.  Right.  Mima, Mimu, Mama, Papi, Poo Poo.  Yeah, and the funny thing was, I didn't even have a dead grandmother.  Ah.  Ah, okay.  You're fucking around. 
[03:01:00]  Good for you.  Yeah.  In my humble opinion, he's a complete and utter fraud.  Yeah.  Yes.  I just find it hard to believe that anybody can communicate.  I wish all that stuff was believable to me.  That'd be great.  I wish I could believe it.  It'd be amazing.  It's such a nice, reassuring thing.  That would absolutely prove that there's life after death.  That would be an amazing thing for everybody.  Let's go to Tom from the float place.  Tom, where's your float place?  Long Island? 
[03:01:30]  Yes, sir.  Long Island.  It's in Fongville.  It opened up in November, man.  I'm supposed to go, right?  Yeah.  I'll send you some stuff in the mail.  I'll get it out to you.  I've always wanted to float.  I learned about floating from Brother Wee's back in the day.  What is it?  One of those chambers that you lay in?  With all that salt and shit.  Is it sensory deprivation?  All the salt makes it where it's impossible to go into the water.  Then you close that cover up, and it's nice and dark, and you kind of chill out.  Then Joe Rogan, obviously, loves to float as well. 
[03:02:00]  I definitely want to try this.  Yeah, you should.  It's about 150 gallons of water, and there's 900 pounds of medical grade Epsom salt.  You actually float on top.  You don't have to try.  You don't have to hold your breath.  You just sit there and float.  Isn't that wild?  Yeah, it is fucking wild, huh?  I'll try it out next time I'm out your way.  I bet you're pretty salty when you get out, huh?  I would imagine so.  There's a shower right next door to the tank.  You step out.  Oh, yeah? 
[03:02:30]  Glory hole in the side?  There is, actually.  Oh, nice.  You guys were talking before about Pendulet and what you can say and what you can't say  about people, and I remember exactly what he said, because I use it day to day whenever  I comment on people.  You're allowed to...  You can say, like, oh, that guy's a fucking asshole, or that guy's out of his fucking mind.  You said the pivotal thing is if you curse when you're insulting them or when you're commenting  on them, that's the biggest thing.  So, when you're talking about, like, the one-hour media, you can't say, oh, she doesn't know  what she... 
[03:03:00]  You know, you can't say, oh, she's a fraud.  But you can't say, she's a fucking lunatic, or she's a fucking fraud.  I could say, in my humble opinion.  Yeah, you could say that.  I believe.  Yes, sir.  I learned that a long time ago.  As long as you say, in my humble opinion.  As I see it.  As I see it, right.  Yeah.  Thank you, buddy.  All right, cheers, Luke.  All right, man.  Cheers.  Let's go to Bob in Texas.  Bob.  All right.  A couple years ago, you know, the guy, my girl sat there and went to over in Houston 
[03:03:30]  where he had it at.  Yeah.  And it was $175 a pop.  There was a couple thousand people there, and when you're standing in line, they make  you fill out a whole card that, you know, your name, contact, the whole thing.  Yeah.  Right.  Then what happened?  Yeah, when people...  He's gone.  Wouldn't people be on to it if you go to one of these places and they make you fill out 
[03:04:00]  cards?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You shouldn't have to fill out anything.  Wouldn't you be the guy there going, I ain't filling out nothing.  And I don't want him to pick me.  Yep.  Or just lie on the card.  But I bet you if you're defiant like that, they figure out a way to get you out of the  taping or something, too.  Because they're desperate people that want to contact loved ones.  What's the matter, Jimmy?  What happened?  You okay?  I don't know.  Are you okay?  What happened?  Are you okay?  I don't know. 
[03:04:30]  Are you okay?  Want to go to break?  Uh-oh.  Jesus.  What?  He he he he he he, he he he, he he, he he. 
[03:05:00]  That's not good.  We'll be right back.  The gentlemen are off to drop a deuce.  Stay tuned for their progress.  On Sirius XM.

[03:27:00]  Breaks  He always loved  Reading the newspaper  Otto loved  Getting knowledge  And he's reading  The newspapers  While we're in break  And I look over  And then I kind of  Like get  Ant's attention  I go  You gotta look at this  What is he doing  And he's reading  The newspaper  And George is reading  Along with Otto  Like he's moving  George's head  And stuff  And I'm  Moving his eyes  Like back and forth  And I never forgot that  Because I'm thinking  Oh my god  He's not doing this  For anyone  He doesn't even realize  We're looking at him  Right now  And I'm like  What is that  I'm like  What is that about 
[03:27:30]  Well that's what it is  It becomes like  You know  It's part of you  Right  You know what I mean  Like to him  And like  When he was done  With his set  Like  No one can tell you  He would wrap  His doll up  His head up  Like you know  Like an Iranian  Or something like that  So it was comfortable  It had like  The headgear on it  But it always had  To go home  Before we went out  After a show  Man  And he always had  Like you know  Rodney loves him  Okay 
[03:28:00]  And he always had  He goes  Listen to this message  We always  Every time we went back  We listened to it  And he's like  Hey kid  I'm telling you  You know what I mean  Let's go  You got it  You know  You're the man  You know  You missed your laugh  You know  But you know  I think he was  Somewhat  A little bit  Afraid of success  Yeah  Yeah  But the whole thing was  Is that you never  You can never  Sit down with a guy  And just  Like  A sweetheart 
[03:28:30]  You know what I mean  Right  Like you know  There's scumbags  In this business  You know what I mean  But you know  I mean  Nobody could say that  About him  I mean  He was a true  Fucking person  And you know  It's just  You wake up  And you're just  Fucking you know  I'm listening to you guys  I finally got my schedule  Set up  And fucking  I got a call  And I'm like  This has got to be  A fucking joke  Because we were just  Talking  Last week  We were supposed to 
[03:29:00]  Go to Florida  Next Friday  Or Saturday  Right  And I'm like  Fuck we were going  To hang out  And that shit  And fucking  I'm just like  I don't  You know what I mean  It makes you think  About everything  You know  It's just  Fucking  Heartbreaking  You never know  A guy who never got  Is doing the business  And uh  You know  He's just another  Funny guy  Who the business  Just did not  Give  What he deserved to  Right  He was another  Funny guy 
[03:29:30]  Where all these  Fucking  Mediocre  Motherfuckers  Because the critics  Like him  And because  They uh  They carry  The right narrative  Or ideology  And a brilliantly  Funny guy  Like him  And he  Otto was  Punch you in the  Stomach funny  Nobody made  People laugh  When he killed  It was  Absolutely  Unfollowable  Yeah  And he's one  Of those guys  That all the  Comedians would  Walk in to watch  And I remember  Somebody at a  Roast  It was years ago 
[03:30:00]  This is probably  1992 or 93  Was talking  About somebody  And they said  They mentioned  What did he say  About Otto  He said something  About you'll notice  That the comedians  In the room  He was a roast  That the public  Was at  And he said  You'll know  Who the comedians  In the room are  Because they're  The ones in the room  Who are not laughing  Until Otto is on  And then they're  Going to be  The only ones  Who are  And I always  Remember that  Is such a great  Description of  Mixing Otto  With comics 
[03:30:30]  And the public  Right  And he would  Just come up  That's what  He always said  He always said  How come  These pieces  Of shit  Are on TV  And we can't  Get a fucking  Special  You know  What I mean  He goes  It's because  You know  What I mean  Like these MTV  Guys  They got 15  Fucking minutes  They're fucking  Selling out  Are you fucking  Kidding me  Comedy is  So fucking  Like  You know  Like me  Jenny  You know  Otto 
[03:31:00]  Florentine  Deposit  You know  Everybody  That you know  That's fucking  Anybody  That's fucking  Powerful  And knows comedy  It's just  Just such a  Shitty  Fucking business  Because  They put out  Shit on TV  Yet  You know  What I mean  So people  Don't go  As the clubs  They're like  If this is  What's in clubs  No  That's not  What's in clubs  Where are  Fucking clubs  Come and see  Fucking real  Comedy man  Not some  Fucking  18 year old  Fucking girl  That  That has 
[03:31:30]  15  Fucking minutes  It's just  One of those  Things  Thank you brother  I'll talk to you soon  I'll see you  I'm sure  I'll see you  Before the  Thing  Thanks man  Help out the  Family  Alright  Bobby  Bob Lee  It's just  Very close  With Otto  George  Jimmy just  Told us  That Otto  Died in his  Sleep  Yeah  I got the  Call from Jim  In  During the thing  Right  I just  Really weird  To not be able  To say  That  You know  I just  Couldn't say it 
[03:32:00]  Right  It was you know  Whatever  We all act weird  When we hear that  And then  You take a couple  Minutes  But it's just  Terrible  Do you remember  The first time  You met him  Or saw him  Yep  It was in  The varsity pub  And it was  Before I did comedy  I was just starting  And me and my buddy  Would go to watch  Shows  That's where I first saw  Florentine  And guys like  Quentin Higgs  And that guy  Jeff Zabrowski  Who I did get  An update on  By the way  He retired  And won some  Kind of lotteries  Oh really  Yeah he's doing good  But Otto  Was one of the guys  That Patrick Gaynor 
[03:32:30]  Who was the guy  Who really  I would not be doing comedy  If it wasn't Patrick Gaynor  Told me  Who was Patrick Gaynor  He was a local booker  Oh okay  And he died years ago  And the varsity pub  Was the first place  I ever went on  So I would go  And watch the shows  On the weekends  And I would never  Heckle the comics  Sometimes Patrick  Would let me  Like introduce the show  Just to get me on stage  Before I ever performed  And that's where  I saw Otto  For the first time  And I  It was  It was  It was like  Seeing Zeppelin  For you know  Yeah  Jesus 
[03:33:00]  Yeah  Seeing him  For the first time  Was a shock  Right  Like  And I think  I saw him  At  The place  Fast Eddie's  That was the first place  I saw him  They taped them  And then  That was one of those  Tapes  You gotta remember  Way before the internet  I'm talking like  My BAB days  So what  92 to 95-ish  Somewhere in there  And they taped them  A couple times  And that tape man  Yeah yeah  By the time you got a copy  You almost couldn't 
[03:33:30]  You know  Hear it anymore  But that's  He was one of those guys  Where his stuff  Was just passed around  And traded  If he was gonna be around  Locally  Everyone knew it  Right  And you had to go see him  Because he was like  The  You know  You were gonna see shit  You weren't gonna see  Anywhere else  But you had to go  Pick him up  Always  All you guys have stories  About that  Yeah yeah  You'd have to pick him up  He lived off Jewel Avenue  In Queens at one point  And I lived in North Brunswick  And I remember  I would pick him up  To go to  You'd have to go 
[03:34:00]  Yeah  Wow  Wow that's a hell of a try  Right  I remember  What's his name  Oh great  White gorilla  He used to have to  Pick him up all the time  Oh yeah Jeff  Jeff Norris  I remember he stepped  In dog shit  And brought him in my car  And I wanted to  Fucking strangle him  So I just got the car  And Florentine was with me  He's like  Otto you tracked  The whole log in the car  He brought a fucking  It was like a log  Of horse shit  I was like  You dope  It wasn't just a little  No  Giant beast  He brought the whole log  Yeah he brought the whole log in  Is Florentine up for talking 
[03:34:30]  Or not really  I don't know  I don't want to force  Any worry on the show  But maybe get word out  If he wants to call him  That would be great  I also remember at NEW  He was this funny  That we like tolerated  Some of his stuff  Like he would kill  For a minute or two  And then feel like  It wasn't going well  And then he would just leave  And me and Anthony  Would sit  And certainly Jimmy too  Would solve this over the years  And all of a sudden  Where did he go  He would just run out  He got that under control 
[03:35:00]  Years later  But  You remember those days  Yep  I like it  He thought he sucked  He's gone  I'm like  He was killing  Yeah  Oh this just sucks  No it's just  Enough of this  I fucking hate it  I mean you just gotta kinda  You know  Get through it  What do you do  There's no fucking  Nothing you can do  There's nothing you can do  You just gotta  Feel like shit 
[03:35:30]  Now for  You know  Everybody makes it  How come Otto  Wasn't able to become  More of a star  That's a pretty good question  I don't know  He was one like  Fucking Patrice  He wouldn't play the game  He wouldn't  I think  I think it's one part  Of his career  It was probably  His demons  Yeah  And  Substance abuse  That kept him from  Really achieving  But then  You know  He's not gonna compromise  And not say  Pope wrote  Cunt sir 
[03:36:00]  He never had the proper  Management  I don't think  He ever had the proper  People  Rick Messina  Really loved him  Who was Tim Allens  All those guys  Loved Otto  Right  And they really did  And he was in  Comedy's Dirtiest Dozen  With Chris Rock  And Bill Hicks  And a bunch of those guys  You know  And I think  That they loved him  But it's like  What do you do  Yeah  With a dirty  Ventriloquist  I'm guessing  That's what the business  Which is so uncreative  And pathetic  And every time  They come out  With those fucking  Funniest people lists  I want to just 
[03:36:30]  Fucking strangle  The dummy  Who wrote it  Because there's usually  10 people  That really  Or 15 people  I think  Really deserve  To be on it  And then  And the other  35 that are just  Like oh you  Fucking  Really  Benicio Del Toro  Is he a hoot  It's just the weirdest  You know  And it's like  A guy like Otto  Will never make a list  Like that  Yeah  Never  And he was funnier  Than any of them  Yeah  He was funnier  Than any of them  Jeez  Oh jeez  Yeah  Boy did I work with him  Having some fucking 
[03:37:00]  Awful shows too  Well when they didn't  Like him  It was ugly  Oh yeah  Yeah  There was no ambiguity  They hated him  Boy it was full steam ahead  Right  But he had no problem  With that  No he didn't like it  But I mean  He knew how to deal with it  I mean he would just  He couldn't change gears  He was who he was  Yeah  You know  And so he would just  Kind of fucking  Plow ahead  And make it worse for him  Oh he could rip into people  Oh man  Yeah  Wow he says some great stuff 
[03:37:30]  Yeah  We got any  Otto and George stuff  We could play today  Yeah  What do we  You guys find a few  Well we're looking  Through stuff right now  But we actually have  The Wizards of Oz  The line  Oh god  Yeah  A little two minute  Oh good  Alright  Thing if you want to  Go to it at any point  Yeah why don't we do that now  We'll go to break with this  And then we'll continue  Oh yeah  She dressed immaculately  In an elegant royal blue 
[03:38:00]  Dressing gown  Then with her hair  Properly styled  She took an overdose  Of sleeping pills  She laid down on the couch  Covered herself  With a gold blanket  Over her shoulders  And tied a plastic bag  Over her head  And then she shoved  Hay in her twat  And asshole  After all that  Beautifying  She just shoved  Hay in her twat  And asshole  Oh god 
[03:38:30]  Yeah maybe grass  Too  Annie M  Read the note  She left behind  Read the note  She left a note  Behind it said  Sorry  I love that man  I am now  About to make  The great adventure  I cannot endure  This agonizing pain  Any longer  It is all over my body  Neither can I face  The impending blindness  I pray the lord  My soul to take  Amen  Wow  And then her landlady  Found her  And then she died 
[03:39:00]  Oh that's great  Hay is such an unpleasant  Thing to shoving  Your twat  And asshole  And asshole  Like mulch would be okay  Because it's soft grass  No that's hard  But hay would hurt  Your kind of grass  Perforate things  Was she sick  Or just not getting work  She shoved hay  Just not getting work  No one wanted Annie M  In 1962  Nobody's hiding  I gotta shove hay  In my mouth  Cunt and asshole  Give me a fucking  Dry cleaning bag  Or room 206

[03:55:00]  Couldn't sleep  And I looked  On twitter  And I saw  Levy's  Tweets  About Otto  And George  I can't fucking  Believe it  Man  I'm like  In shock  Right now  What's going to happen  Well that's what  We're all trying  To figure out  I think we  I think Jimmy  Said that he  Took a nap  And that was it  I will  I'm sure we'll  Get more info  Later  But yeah  That fucking  Blows  He was so  God damn  Funny  Yeah  He  The thing that  Always blew me  Away about him  Was like 
[03:55:30]  When the dummy  Would do like  His inner monologue  Yeah  And like  I remember  Seeing him at  Carol Orange  And like  You know  He did a joke  That didn't go  Over that  Like Otto  Said a joke  That didn't go  Over that well  And then the dummy  Looked at him  And started going  What are you  Nervous  You fucking  Pussy  Yeah  Yes  It would be  It was the greatest  Inner monologue  Reaction ever  Because he had  The puppet  And it would be  Very funny  Like if a joke  Didn't work  And Otto  Would just  Stammer something 
[03:56:00]  George would go  Sweat you  Danish junkie  Your lips are moving  You're supposed to be  Creating an illusion  Oh he would just  Deconstruct  Nobody ever  Deconstructed  Themself better  Than fucking Otto  Through his puppet  The brilliance of that  You know  Nobody  Did that better  Than him  It's so funny  I remember  I remember  We did the nasty  Show  At Just for Laughs  One year  And the two 
[03:56:30]  Things I remember  Is one  He did the  He did the  Kennedy bit  Where the puppet  Gets shot  And the brains  Come out  Like the Kennedy assassination  And during it  He's going  They're shooting  Norton  They're shooting  They're shooting  Put the top up  Norton  Yeah put the top up  Norton  They're shooting at us  So funny  Went to a  Honeymooner stand  Honeymoon  Right  Oh shit  That's so good man  And then  And then  And then I remember  Patrice was on the shows too  It's so fucking sad man 
[03:57:00]  Jesus Christ  But Patrice was on the shows too  And we were down  The theater we were in  The green room was downstairs  Under the stage  And there was this long  Cinder block hallway  So if anybody was coming down  The hallway from the stage  You could hear it  It was just echo  And I remember Patrice was  Otto was on stage  And Patrice came walking down  And Patrice's cackle  Was like cascading  Off the cinder block  And he walks in the room  And I go  What's so funny man  And he goes  Otto  Just don't give a fuck 
[03:57:30]  About even trying to make you  Look like  Ventrilous  He's talking  He's talking  I can so fucking see that  Don't give a fuck  Oh shit man  Oh that's great  Hey Joe DeRosa  Yeah  I forgot about this  We were talking about dreams earlier  I had a dream  That Joe DeRosa was in  Oh really  Yes  And this was just like  Two nights ago 
[03:58:00]  Yeah  I was  I was in this bedroom  Trying to  Have sex with this girl  On a mattress  On the floor  And you were on a bed  In the same room  But it was on like  A frame  Bed frame  So it was a little higher up  And I was trying to fuck  Real quiet  So you wouldn't hear  But I don't know  Why you were in the room  What was going on  I don't know why I was either  The most  Most unrealistic part of the dream  Was that I was wearing a condom 
[03:58:30]  Because  You're responsible in your dreams  I know why in a dream  When I wear a condom  What an asshole  I don't know  But he dream rapes Joe  But he's responsible enough  To wear a condom  And the condom  Was weird  The condom was making  A squeaky rubber noise  That I thought  Was going to wake Joe up  Right  Fucking odd  I like that your dream  Was reinforcing  That you shouldn't wear condoms  Yes  That's the lesson  That's the lesson  I grabbed out of the dream  Fuck the condoms  I love that I was in the dream 
[03:59:00]  I am too  You got up  You walked out of the room  I was like  Hey Joe  Yeah  When are you  Are you planning on  Coming back to New York  Anytime soon  For some beverages  Yeah  I think I'm going to be  In New York all of July  So  Oh nice  I hope  I hope I get to see  All of you guys  And hang out  I just cracked  Just cracked the pool open  My friend  So  I have a party coming up  I love it  Yeah party

[04:01:00]  Of the stage  And it's like  This big Italian guy  The guy's got to weigh  400 pounds  He's just huge  But he's wearing  This checkered sport coat  And Otto's on stage  And he's doing a bit  And the dummy  Like isn't  You know  Isn't paying attention  And in the middle  Of the bit  The fucking dummy  Just looks over  At the fat guy  And he just goes  Jesus fucking Christ  How much  What size is that  Sport coat  You fucking zilch  And it would seem like 
[04:01:30]  Oh my god  Why is the puppet  Saying that  When Otto was in the middle  Of doing something  Like  For somebody who moved  His lips  When he talked  Working at puppet  You were completely  Fooled into thinking  It was a different entity  Oh absolutely  You know  It was a different  Fucking person  Absolutely  He was twittering out  A lot of old photos  Recently too  Like stuff from  Like the 70s  Wow  Really like when he was  15  14 years old  If you see his

[04:05:30]  It's kind of  You know  Will he just disappear  Or  Because he made him  So mortal  That it's like  Yeah  Yeah  We're gonna lose George too  Yeah  No one else can  Fucking use him  Fucking just  Kind of a weird thing  Yeah  George goes with Otto  Yeah  Period  Well okay  That's a strange concept  Do you think that would be  If Otto had a  If Otto had a will  I have no idea  I would guarantee  That's a will  Yeah  George goes with me  You know  There's only one thing to say  Get over it 
[04:06:00]  Well  Yeah I know  In time perhaps  But  There's a time  You know  You guys make so much fun  Of so many  But it's weird  When it hits you  You almost feel like  You guys can't  I mean I know  You're gonna joke about it  But it's so  I mean I remember  You guys  You're panicking sir  I lost somebody  You're panicking  Why are you panicking  Because the get over it thing  Didn't work that well  Yeah  Because now you're panicking on us  That's exactly what it was  I get it  We would have done the same thing  Yeah we would have played get over it  All right  All right  Wish them all the best  All right 
[04:06:30]  Stop panicking please  Thank you  Tony in Brooklyn  Did your testicles get hit by a storm window  Moosh on  That might be one of the funniest clips ever played  And I downloaded it when it was on  What do you call the free  Yeah  Man I loved all your old clips  And man he was a star  At AEW man 
[04:07:00]  We've all gone back and forth  The greatest live read ever  And it was always between  Otto and George  And Brewer's  Razor Rollerboard Scooter one  Yeah  Between those two  I can't even think of a third  That would be in that category  Those were just amazing  Was there a time  When Pat from Winaki  Went down on a girl  In our studio  Maybe  That's what I'm getting here  It says  And Otto was there  And he said  It's like watching  Tor Johnson 
[04:07:30]  Bobbing for gonorrhea  Oh  He definitely said that  That was actually  One of your lines of the day  Right there  He definitely said that  Tor Johnson  Bobbing for gonorrhea  Holy fuck  Is that funny  Yeah  Lisa Sparks  Lisa Sparks  Is that  All right  Okay  All right  Yes  Right  Thank you  You A-Rab  Let's go to  Ernesto  Looks like  Staten Island  Hey 
[04:08:00]  Oh  Sad day man  Sad day  Yeah  Yeah  I had heard  About this guy  Who was  A ventriloquist  With a filthy puppet  A couple  And then about a year later  You guys had him on  For Anthony's birthday  And they did  And you guys did  The Bouchon commercial  Yeah  I still  I have that  Yeah  I bootlegged  Played it  That it's still  One of the funniest  Oh you did  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I 
[04:08:30]  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I 
[04:09:00]  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  I  Wait, she twisted motherfuckers out there.  Wait, it wasn't all at the same time?  No, no.  Obviously, if they're calling it seven babies.  Over ten years.  Over ten years.  I guess she didn't want to have, you know, those babies.  Right.  So she had them and then killed them. 
[04:09:30]  And no one knew until now?  I guess not.  She's a weird-looking bitch.  She's got them crazy eyes.  How long would the baby survive before she decided they were evil or whatever the fuck?  Nah, nah.  Nah, nah.  Yeah, when do, when do, how crazy do you have to be?  Like, does that, does it come up how crazy you are for how long you wait before you realize  your baby's the devil or something and then have to get rid of it? 
[04:10:00]  Aw.  Let's see.  Let's say hi to Corey in Yonkers.  Corey.  Yes, Corey.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  All right.  All right.  No, I just went to, like, one of the first times I ever saw Otto was in 1990 or 91 in Yonkers  at a place called Shooting Stars.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  And it was owned by Grandpa Al, I think, at the time.  Oh, sure.  Right.  And no, I mean, I was only, like, 18, 19 years old, and they would let you in.  And just the impact that he had on me, he was one of the funniest people I ever saw from then on. 
[04:10:30]  You would always keep seeing him.  But, you know, even though his act mostly didn't change over the past 20-something years,  I think there were a few new ones in there.  But that night, the girl I was with was just a very conservative girl, and boy, did I get  an earful coming out that night.  Oh, really?  Especially if she got up and decided to go to the bathroom during his set.  I think Otto was very particular, because he absolutely came up with new stuff all the  time.  But it was small. 
[04:11:00]  It was a line or two, you know what I mean?  But every time he had something new, it killed every time.  Every fucking time.  Oh, yeah.  I must have seen him at least, you know, five or six times over all the years and stuff  like that.  And just, yeah, some of the stuff was the same, and a lot of, you know, some of the stuff  was new.  But, yeah, just every time.  But he was one of those comics, too, that you could go and see him do some of the same  stuff, because you wanted to watch the reaction of the crowd.  Like, you knew what was coming, so you're like, oh, fuck, I want to see, like, what this 
[04:11:30]  old bag up front is going to do when that line comes out, you know?  Right.  But one time that always got me, I forgot where the heck it was, someplace in New Jersey.  And I guess he was getting ready to go up, and he was sitting behind me with George.  And I guess he was warming up, but they were basically having a conversation with each other.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We all saw a little of that over the years.  I used to bring him on stage sometimes, because he hated when you refer to the puppet as a  wooden pal or wooden friend.  Oh. 
[04:12:00]  Just to annoy him.  Oh, no.  I would go on stage sometimes and say, please welcome Otto and his wooden buddy, George.  Because he hated being introduced like that.  Did he say something when you left the stage and he took the mic?  I don't remember.  I know that he just sees something under his breath.  He despised it.  Like a motherfucker, I'm sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He really loathed it.  Yeah.  There was one time I was sitting up close, and I used to be really friggin' fat.  I mean, I lost like 170 pounds over the past year.  Yeah.  Congrats. 
[04:12:30]  But, yeah, thank you.  But he looked at me, or the puppet looked at me, and he just looked at me like, ring  ding.  Just out of nowhere.  Ring ding.  He would just do that.  It was so funny when he would just stop what he was saying, and then George would jump  in, but you're like, no, that's him.  Right.  He's doing the whole thing.  Yeah.  Genius.  I didn't want to share that, guys.  I'm sorry to hear about, you know, about Otto.  Oh, my God.  Everyone's sad.  Are you kidding me?  He would grab, like, George's arm, or the lapel of George's little jacket, and be like, 
[04:13:00]  no, George, and pull him up.  Right.  Take your hands off me, cocksucker.  Take your hands off me.  Stop touching me.  Oh, fucking great.  All right, Corey, thanks.  Sweat, you Danish junkie.  Oh, that made me laugh.  What a great fucking jab at himself.  We got Mike Francesa.  He was a huge fan of Otto.  I don't think.  What's up, Mike?  My condolences, man.  He's fucking one of my favorites, man.  Seriously.  He's one of the comedians that fucking, you can tell his, like, repeat his material. 
[04:13:30]  Somebody can repeat his material to you.  Like, I saw Otto at George, and he actually was fucking funny, like, coming from somebody  else.  Yeah, yeah, you're right.  And fucking so funny that I was listening recently to, like, the old N.E.W. days, and  fucking, he wasn't even in the studio just doing the impression of George.  You guys were fucking with Dice.  And Dice was like, who is that?  Is that Otto in there?  And Ant's doing a puppet. 
[04:14:00]  He's going, no, it's just George.  And Dice was like, oh, they split up?  What happened to them?  You know what I mean?  He was like, oh, they split up what happened to them.  Yeah, Dice obviously knows how to go with a good bit.  Exactly.  Right.  It is fucking great, man.  But like I said, man, one of my favorites.  And, you know, it just, it sucks.  Somebody mentioned that, you know, the life of wrestlers, man, the comedians are right  up there, man.  Oh, shit.  All the good ones go.  You know what I mean?  So, like I said, I didn't do the stupid voice today, so I just wanted to fucking, you  know, say I'm sorry to you fellas.  Talk to you guys later.  All right.  Thanks, Mike. 
[04:14:30]  I don't even know his real name.  I just know him as Mike Francesa.  That was kind of cool.  The amount of character.  Yeah.  Otto and George on The Late Show with David Letterman.  We should play this.  Wow.  He was very funny on that.  This was around, yeah, okay, 2007-ish?  They did Ventriloquist Week.  Right.  Oh, wow.  And Otto was the last one.  I think it was kind of a slam at Ventriloquist, but he did really well on Letterman.  He worked very well clean.  Wow.  Yeah, let's play this right now for Otto.  Thank you.  It's great to be here. 
[04:15:00]  Happy Valentine's Day, everybody.  I just hope to God you don't curse.  Nah, I'm not going to curse.  Happy Valentine's Day.  And look, I got a big heart on.  Would you like to touch it?  No, no, no, thanks.  Just take this off here.  Yeah.  You look good.  Nice shirt.  I didn't know Ted Bundy had a catalog.  So what do you got planned for Valentine's Day?  Well, me and my girlfriend like to eat, you know?  So I'm going to take her to a nice restaurant for a romantic candlelit dinner, followed by 
[04:15:30]  a smooth elevator ride up to the room, and then I'm going to watch the Letterman show.  Well, of course.  Yeah.  And as she talks when it's on, I'm going to crack her skull open with an ashtray.  That sounds real romantic.  Just don't curse.  Yeah.  I can't curse that entertainment tonight can show Britney Spears Velcro when she's getting  out of the car with no underwear on.  I can't believe we're here at the Ed Sullivan Theater. 
[04:16:00]  This is just amazing, the history here.  You know, Elvis Presley, Jim Morrison.  Yeah, both dead.  Speaking of dead, are they storing the bodies in here?  I'm freezing.  It's freezing in here.  It's cold outside.  This gig sucks.  All right.  Oh, my God.  The Statue of Liberty has the torch under her dress.  All right. 
[04:16:30]  Ventriloquist leak.  You know, they're mocking our profession.  Yeah, Letterman over there, the skinny guy.  Looks like Audrey Hepburn.  No, he looks good.  He should eat something.  You can afford it.  Have a gyro, pal.  He looks like he should be a bouncer at a salad bar.  All right.  By the way, I like you in Cabin Boy.  That was your best work since Mork and Mindy.  He's like De Niro without the talent. 
[04:17:00]  All right.  Come on.  Paul Schafer.  Yeah, he looks good.  Your barber called.  The turtle waxes in.  All right.  Stop that.  Does your head slide off the pillow at night?  He's like Letterman's puppet.  Who's working your head?  All right.  Be nice, George.  By the way, I drive a taxi here in New York. 
[04:17:30]  Anybody recognize me?  Hey, George, have you ever had anybody really famous in your taxi?  Yeah, I had former governor in New York, Pataki, in the cab.  What kind of name is Pataki?  It sounds like something you stepped in on the way to the car, you know?  Hey, that's Pataki.  Walk around it.  All right.  Mommy, I made a Pataki.  Who else have you had? 
[04:18:00]  I had McGreevy, the governor in New Jersey.  I made him right up front.  He ain't sitting behind me.  Why don't you leave him alone?  It's an alternative lifestyle.  Yeah, right.  Being Amish is an alternative lifestyle.  All right.  What did the black lesbian say to the white lesbian?  You the man!  All right.  Hey, George, did you, uh, did you see Brokeback Mountain? 
[04:18:30]  Yeah.  What'd you think?  Loved him, hated him.  All right.  You know the original title of that was A Fist Full of Testicles?  All right.  No way.  All right.  We better hurry up.  We got four minutes and they're throwing us out of here.  Try getting in this building tomorrow, Geppetto.  All right.  George, do you like plane travel?  Oh, man.  It sucks.  Every time I get in an airplane, I'm never sitting next to a cute girl. 
[04:19:00]  I'm always sitting next to some old guy who wants to talk, you know?  Where you from?  Where you going?  Where am I going?  Look at your ticket.  That's where we're all going.  Oh, man.  I'd like to sing a song for Valentine's Day.  This is the love song from the movie Jaws.  Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to.  Good crowd, right?  Yeah, and Sonny Bono's a good skier. 
[04:19:30]  All right.  I love Jaws.  Jaws was a great movie.  Remember the opening scene in Jaws?  This drunk girl goes swimming naked.  I'm drunk.  Come on in the water.  Come on in.  And then you hear, ta-dun, ta-dun.  Ah, ha, ha.  Come on in, the water's name.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Ah, ha, ha.  Doesn't this broad here the music?  Get out of the water, that shark music.  All right. 
[04:20:00]  Hey, is anybody here from New Jersey?  New Jersey?  Kill yourself.  What a polluted dump New Jersey is now.  New Jersey, where a fart is refreshing.  Seriously.  Here's a poem I wrote about Jersey.  It's called Pollution.  It's a poem.  Go ahead.  I shot an arrow into the air.  It's stuck.  Thank you. 
[04:20:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Wow.  Jeez.  Yeah, you did very well there.  That was a ballier set than most comics have heard about that show.  Sure.  Fistful of testicles.  Fistful of testicles.  It's funny, man.  Sonny Bono's a good steer.  He was brutal.  Try getting into this building tomorrow.  That's a good idea.  Oh, shit.  What did he say?  Loved him, hated him.  Loved him, hated him. 
[04:21:00]  This freaking sucks.  Yeah.  Yeah, damn.  That was a great set.  I remember we all were a little excited for Otto.  Like, okay.  Yeah.  This is going to really push him forward, forward.  Yeah.  To more places.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Oh.  Let's take a look.  I always take a peek down the hall. 
[04:21:30]  What's the matter, Sam?  Nothing.  Oh.  How are you going to do your after show today?  What do you mean, how?  Well, you know, it's very hard to get through these moments.  I don't think you're professional enough to, you know, rise to the occasion.  Well, I mean, talk about Otto.  Oh, boy.  Reflect.  Yeah.  Reflecting.  And then, you know, worst case scenario, I'll try to get Sal and Erock to fight about  something.  That's always a good go-to. 
[04:22:00]  Yeah.  You need your go-tos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  People want us to play the Yoo-Hoo clip with Otto and Jay, but that was, like...  Yeah.  They were...  Yeah, that wasn't really a showcase of...  No.  Oh.  It was accusations and...  Yeah.  Yes.  Oh, whatever.  Almost came to fisticuffs.  Not really.  All right.  We certainly could call it, so... 
[04:22:30]  Well...  If you want, we can end on a four-minute clip.  What do you got?  I have Big A and the Johnny Ola murder.  That's 4.15.  Sounds funny enough, just from the title.  Eric says it's good.  Johnny Ola.  Hey, Johnny Ola, take me here.  Oh, that one was great.  Stupid Fredo.  Yeah, it's fine.  So, um...  I don't know.  Whatever.  Nah.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Oh, we're gonna try the Johnny Ola murder on Big A, because you know how they do this... 
[04:23:00]  Johnny Ola!  The Mythbusters?  It doesn't look like you could snap somebody's neck with a wooden hanger.  That fucking bottom part is pretty frail.  Yeah, yeah.  So I'm gonna try...  I'm gonna try and murder Big A on the next show.  Johnny Ola?  Yeah.  I'm gonna see if that'll work.  Otto's a huge fan of Big A.  Johnny Ola was killed with the hanger, or he killed somebody.  He was killed with it.  Yeah.  It was the bodyguard.  The old man bodyguard that didn't even have a name.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Was it Rocco Lampone or no?  Yeah.  The bodyguard? 
[04:23:30]  I don't remember, but when they told Michael, your bodyguard is dead, he had no reaction.  He just went, so where'd you get my kid for Christmas?  It's like, no feeling.  I'm glad I'm here with movie aficionados.  Yes.  Here's a quick, before you go, five minutes left.  Yeah.  Godfather question.  Yeah.  Original Godfather.  Okay.  How did, and this is not a quiz, but how did the father, Don Corleone, how did he know  after that meeting, when he said, I did not know to this day that it was Barzini, how did 
[04:24:00]  he know, what happened in the meeting for him to know that it was Barzini the whole time?  I knew he said it and he figured it out, but what instance happened for you to go back  and go, oh, this is what happened for him to know?  That was probably the one question everyone fucking had.  I think it was him, the way Barzini manipulated the meeting and ran the meeting and made it  happen.  I think Barzini, he was just a smart guy, Don Corleone.  And he was too agreeable. 
[04:24:30]  And he was like, uh.  Yeah, he was too agreeable.  He was too agreeable.  And he said, a refusal is not the act of a friend.  Yeah.  If he has them, he must share them.  Yeah.  And I think that was probably it.  It was probably that subtle way he led that meeting.  Yeah.  And got Don Corleone to concede his point that he had been fighting with to tell you about.  And I think that's what he knew.  So it was never a moment.  It just was an overall theme.  Yeah, perceptive.  A mobster hunch that he knew from, you know, growing up.  Watched The Godfather 2.  And those guys just on a maybe that year did something. 
[04:25:00]  On a maybe, right, right.  You know, better, better, better.  I didn't know until this day.  Well, I kind of know.  Ah, fuck him anyway.  Yeah, he didn't pass the catch up that one time, so fuck him.  Why take a chance?  Yeah, but he said he goes, he could charge for these services.  He's not, we're not communists.  I think just the way he led it and made it happen.  Yeah, yeah.  Tipped him off.  Yeah, good enough.  That helps me to watch it again.  And wanted the drugs done.  I think it also said that Bartini wanted the drugs sold. 
[04:25:30]  Yeah.  Because I think.  Some real greaseball shit.  He might have thought that Bartini would side with him on no drugs.  Right, right.  But when Bartini said that, that indicated that he was on the side of the drugs being sold.  Yeah, yeah.  But didn't he kill, but didn't they kill anybody anyway?  Yeah.  They ran up killing everybody, right?  Michael did.  And he knew he could make that, that swear that oath.  And Michael would do it.  He knew Michael would do it.  Yeah, Don Corleone didn't have to do anything.  Even Stracci, who I have no idea who the fuck that was.  Stracci, when he tells them, Stracci, Stracci. 
[04:26:00]  Who's that?  What?  Me, I thought he was all itchy and stopped scratching.  Fucking shit.  You're fucking Stracci.  Fucking shit.  I bet Stracci's going through the names and you hear Stracci, you're like, who?  Who the fuck was Stracci?  Yeah, he probably killed him on a horse's head or something, right?  So it was no definitive thing that happened then?  No.  No, I don't think there was one moment where they, it wasn't such a blatant thing.  I think it would have been corny if it was this blatant, like, ha ha, where he looked and  curled his mustache and his fingers. 
[04:26:30]  Yeah, when Michael found out Fredo did it, it was kind of a moment of dun-dun, like, that  happened.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It wasn't like, oh shit.  It was like, he fucked up, he lied.  So I thought it was maybe a moment there where he fucked up.  Yeah, Johnny Ola took me here.  Johnny Ola showed up.  What an asshole Fredo is.  Yeah.  No, no, we never met.  I never, no, no.  And there's like five minutes later, ah, me and Johnny Ola.  Johnny comes here all the time.  What an idiot.  Fucking dummy beluga whale far-headed fuck. 
[04:27:00]  Then Michael, then Michael kissed him.  I was like, what, are you still getting fresh?  All right.  It's fucking Friday.  I ain't putting up with this shit.

[04:32:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Post Show.  Post Show.  With Sam Roberts.  Yes, it is.  Welcome to the Post Show.  Call up now.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  And be a part of the Opie and Anthony Post Show.  With me, Sam Roberts.  Taking your phone calls on everything that went down today, of course.  Any memories of Otto and George.  Favorite moments.  Things you want to reflect on. 
[04:32:30]  Feel free to share.  Taking lots of calls.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969 to call in.  We found out earlier today that this morning while the show was on.  That our friend Otto from Otto and George passed away.  Within the last couple days.  I don't know if we know exactly what day it was.  But we just found out this morning while the show was on.  So most of the second half of the show was spent kind of reflecting on his life. 
[04:33:00]  And specifically his experience with the show.  We'll get into that in a minute.  But first, why don't we play Line of the Day, Sal?  Here comes the Line of the Day, Line of the Day, Line of the Day.  Getting in our way, so if we have anything new, we're going to refuse.  No doubt about it. 
[04:33:30]  Fuck her right in the pussy.  He felt compelled to get a fucker right in the room.  Whoever that guy is, just one Line of the Day.  So congratulations to that guy who, somebody from Minnesota.  If you haven't seen that video, we posted it on our Twitter and Facebook pages.  Which is at O&A Show.  So I guess the Minnesota's college hockey team lost the NCAA hockey championships over the weekend.  And completely destroyed this announcer's live shot that he was doing for the news. 
[04:34:00]  So it's a really, really funny video if you haven't checked it out.  But, I mean, the news of the day certainly was finding out that Otto from Otto and George has passed away.  Now, we're not, we don't know how it happened.  I believe we know that he apparently died in his sleep.  But he was a part of the O&A Show for years and years. 
[04:34:30]  Back to the WNEW days.  I mean, easily 10 to 12 years he's been doing the O&A Show.  And, I mean, you heard, if you were listening to the end of the show, you heard his set on Letterman.  And, I mean, even as filthy a comedian as Otto was, even on Letterman he's able to pull off a set like that.  Which was hilarious.  All of us, the mics were off.  But all of us in the studio were laughing.  He was, of course, part of the traveling virus tour that we did for a couple years. 
[04:35:00]  And that's the thing.  He was able to pull off doing a set on Letterman as well as going in front of an audience that really, when it boiled down to it,  the reason that they stopped, Opie and Anthony stopped doing the traveling virus tour was because the audience was simply out for blood.  I mean, they would go out of their way to make life tough for the comedians on stage.  And Otto would just constantly have them in the palm of his hand. 
[04:35:30]  Such an interesting guy, too.  Do we have an Otto and George clip to start, Sal?  Yeah.  Do you want that gonorrhea clip that they were talking about?  Yeah, we were talking about the gonorrhea clip a little earlier.  Let's hear that.  I almost wish I was gay.  I would love to rape him.  But is he doing pretty good?  Yeah, pretty good.  Gentle?  Yeah.  Very nice.  Did you have a cheeseburger for dinner last night? 
[04:36:00]  Yeah.  I was doing that.  I was just going to say, but no.  Oh, that must have been me.  Oh, I burped.  I was like, no, I had no cheeseburgers.  He's got to be the happy clown always.  I know.  It's like Tor Johnson bobbing for gonorrhea.  Hey, I have no gonorrhea.  Don't give me a complex.  What?  Huh?  Fucking Otto. 
[04:36:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah, don't give her a simplex.  We don't even have to bother later.  We don't even have to bother later.  Holy shit.  Does that conjure an image?  Hmm.  Pat, how's it going?  It's going quick.  And that's what it would be. 
[04:37:00]  Like, one of those spots, that was Pat from Munaki performing oral sex on a woman, I believe.  This was way back when we were on 57th Street and there were no bosses around to tell us that was completely against the rules.  But that's kind of a tough spot for a comedian to be in because generally, not a lot is going to be able to take away from the attention to what's going on in the room.  But Otto was just, I mean, he was a sniper with his lines.  I think he might have been, him and David Teller, probably the two best one-line artists to come into the Opie and Anthony studio, maybe ever. 
[04:37:30]  Intern Adrian, you an Otto and George fan?  Yes.  Do you remember your first exposure?  With this show, yeah.  Listening to some of the older clips.  Yeah.  Especially the one, a lot of college brought up between him and Jay Moore.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Arguing about the Yoo-Hoo.  Yeah, and they argue about that, but then, like, it kind of, because it's such a ridiculous premise.  Like, they were arguing over who compared Yoo-Hoo to diarrhea first. 
[04:38:00]  Yeah.  But then it leads you to listening to the actual joke and you're like, holy shit, there's something about when Otto does this.  It's an art.  Yeah, he was great.  You know?  Okay.  Let's go to Brady in Louisiana.  What's up, Brady?  Hey, I wanted to reflect on my first experience with Otto and George.  It was seventh grade back when XM, before Sirius and XM merged.  It was on the old comedy channel.  I forget what the name of it was.  And it was me, my mom, and my dad in the car. 
[04:38:30]  And Otto and George came on.  And all of a sudden, they just started telling cunt jokes out of nowhere.  And so, Dad and I are just howling.  And we listened to this for about a minute and a half when Mom makes us turn it off.  And I was laughing for, like, five minutes after that.  And then came on on your guys' show.  And it's really my first venture in the truly filthy comedy.  And I wanted to thank him for that.  And isn't it an amazing thing that somebody, because Otto was among the filthiest comics anywhere, 
[04:39:00]  and that somebody who has taken as much heat as he has for being filthy is bringing a father and a son together.  I mean, I don't know what that says about you and your dad, but you guys are bonding over all these C-bombs.  Yeah, it was a great, great family moment.  All right, what's now?  All right, thanks, Brady.  Eric in New York.  Yeah, hi, Sam.  Just so sad to hear him go.  I mean, every time I hear of Otto and George, it just brings me back, my reference point, 
[04:39:30]  to the Mujon commercial on WNW.  It was just a classic, classic bit.  And it just came out of nowhere.  Yeah, we played that during the show a little earlier.  But it was.  I mean, it was just, he didn't know it was a live read.  He didn't know, it was just like, here, let me tell you about this.  And he was able to just riff and create this thing that is maintained for over a decade.  Just amazing.  Just one more question for you.  I may have gotten a ticket or two for the Unmask. 
[04:40:00]  Would Opie and Anthony mind if I bring Lady Di as a date?  Yeah, I think they probably would mind.  But, I mean, if you have an extra ticket, what can we do?  Yeah, I guess I would like to use it.  I mean, they'd probably, yeah, they'd probably be upset about that.  Okay, then I won't upset them.  All right, I'll talk to you later.  I'll see you on Thursday at Unmask.  All right, bye-bye.  Bye.  Jay in Nyack.  Oh, professional broadcaster, Sam Roberts. 
[04:40:30]  It's an honor to be on your show, my friend.  Well, thank you.  Well, I share a lot of the same passion as you do with wrestling and WWE.  And I just couldn't believe when I turned the radio on and heard about Otto.  I don't have any really great funny stories, unfortunately, other than the fact that he made me laugh every time he was on your show or on ONA.  And it's just like, I remember he was supposed to be on a couple of months ago or something, and he didn't show up. 
[04:41:00]  And you guys were like, you know, we can't reach him.  And I had a bad feeling right then because I know he had issues in the past.  And I just hope and pray wherever he is now, he's happy and he rests in peace.  And just, you know, just lots of love and appreciation to him and his family and to the whole Otto and George, you know, family of comedians.  I'm sure Jimmy Norton has got to be, you know, and that's a shout-out to Jim Norton if I could. 
[04:41:30]  I missed his advice show.  And, you know, I wish I had more to add to that today, right?  No, that's good.  Thanks, Jay.  I'm in shock, man.  Yeah, man, thanks a lot.  And that's the thing that, you know, he did, he was guaranteed that he was going to slaughter every time he came on the ONA show.  Like, it wasn't about, you know, the long-form bits.  It wasn't, it was whatever was going on in the studio that day would just be peppered in by some of the most disgusting, wittiest one-liners anywhere. 
[04:42:00]  Let's go to Bello in Staten Island.  Hey, Sammy.  I was just thinking the first time I saw him was probably 30 years ago at a bar in Staten Island.  And I'm always drunk and everything.  But, like you said, he just took control and it was amazing.  And that's it.  Like, you're in a bar in Staten Island.  I'm sure everybody's drinking. 
[04:42:30]  You know, it's just the worst crowd to perform in front of.  And he would just grab you.  So, yes, and he said that joke, what do you call it, four Puerto Ricans, a quicksand, cuatro, cinco.  I'll never forget it.  Loved it.  And I love you, Sammy.  Thanks, bro.  Thank you, Bello.  866-WOW1-WOW, 866-969-1969 if you want to call up the post show and talk a little bit about Otto.  Because the other thing about it is, and he was like, he was the nicest guy that you'll ever meet. 
[04:43:00]  I mean, when I was doing my Sunday show live, he came up one Sunday and said,  Sam, I'm, you know, I want to come up and do your show.  And I said, of course.  And we got to talking.  And past all his act, he was one of the most interesting people that you'll ever encounter just because of his life experiences.  Like, this was a guy who, from the time he was a kid, was performing on the streets of New York.  Like, he was doing his ventriloquist act as a teenager on the sidewalk in New York City, back when New York City was, like, real New York City. 
[04:43:30]  You know, like, taxi driver in New York City.  I mean, he's got stories about being approached by John Lennon.  He performed for John Lennon on the street.  His, David Copperfield, the magician in Vegas, was such a big Otto and George fan that he has one of the original George puppets in his private collection.  That's true.  I mean, it's amazing the amount of lives that this guy touched. 
[04:44:00]  What's the next Otto bit that we want to play for the folks, Sal?  We have Otto on Jeff Dunham.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's hear that because, you know, obviously there are not a lot of successful ventriloquist acts.  So we have, yeah, Otto talking about Jeff.  Like, every radio show I've ever done, they always try and goat me into bad-mouthing Jeff Dunham.  I have nothing against the guy.  I mean, to me, he's more of, like, a Jim Henson than what I do.  I have the one character that's a domineering character.  He's got a thousand little creatures. 
[04:44:30]  And they always try and, like, get me to bash the guy.  I have nothing, you know.  Ah, that fucking rich guy.  Yeah.  That successful guy.  He's an interesting guy.  We've had him on.  He's a wonderful entertainer.  He's cool, Todd.  I have a great Dunham story.  I was playing in Vegas years ago at the Riviera and was working for Steve Sharippa, Bobby Bacaloff and the Sopranos.  So I play in the comedy room, which is like a 300-seat room.  And Dunham, he booked Dunham the same week as me in the big room where Dean Martin used to play. 
[04:45:00]  And all I see is Dunham's picture all over the fucking casino in the elevators.  And normally when I arrived at the hotel, I'd see my picture within five minutes of walking in the hotel.  So I called up Shariffa, and he's a scary guy to talk to.  You know, every conversation he says, I'll bury you in the desert if you don't do the full time.  You know, that's how he talks to you.  He's a big, intimidating guy.  I can see why they hired him for that role.  And so I called him up, pretty much screaming at him.  I go, why is Dunham here the same week as me?  Why is there two ventriloquists? 
[04:45:30]  Why is his picture everywhere?  He goes, are you giving me shit?  And he goes, you're funny and he's not.  If he goes, if you give me any more shit, I'll kick everybody out of this fucking hotel and put puppets in every room.  And then we immediately, both of us just cracked up at the absurdity of that statement.  I'll put puppets in every room.  And then he just started laughing at just the fucking, it was so absurd.  Fucking crazy.  I couldn't believe I screamed at him, no.  Good for you, man.  Because that's a weird booking to have both of you guys.  I didn't get it. 
[04:46:00]  I didn't get it.  Did you have people show up?  Kind of dumb.  Yeah, I had a normal, the Penn Jillette always brings 50 people to see me.  But then Dunham came and he was groveling and kissing my ass.  Oh, wow.  It was great.  You know, he was a really nice guy.  That's the, I mean, you don't have to stop mid-word, but that's the other thing.  I mean, you just heard Penn Jillette goes and brings 50, I mean, Penn Jillette, who does the show all the time,  and maybe we'll try to get him on the phone or something tomorrow because I'd love to hear his reflections.  Penn adores Otto. 
[04:46:30]  I mean, he has come on this show so many times to talk about the affection that he has for Otto.  And I know that last caller or a couple callers ago had said that they had heard that he had had problems or whatever.  But as far as any of us know here at the show, he was in good health.  You know, Otto has had somewhat of a history with some substances or whatever.  But as far as any of us know, and Bob Levy was on the show today to talk about it a little bit, 
[04:47:00]  he was not using.  He had had health problems about a year ago.  He was stuck in Canada and he was hospitalized.  But he recovered from that and he had been on the show since then and he seemed healthy and everything.  So, you know, I just don't want anybody to jump to conclusions as to what caused the death of Otto,  which is what we're talking about today.  But, again, if you have anything you want to add to the conversation, call up 866-WOW1-WOW. 
[04:47:30]  866-969-1969.  And we have one more clip that we want to play before we run out of time.  Is that right, Sal?  Yes, it's Lady Palm's Otto in the head.  Of course.  One of my favorite things, we did a gig in Delaware.  Yeah.  It was a giant fucking, this is many years ago, a giant room, like a big bar.  And afterwards, I was out there and Otto killed and I had a great set.  And there was a girl that walked up to me and she didn't know Otto was the ventriloquist 
[04:48:00]  because he didn't have George with him in the parking lot.  And she just, everyone focuses on George.  So she goes, you were really funny.  And she goes, I liked you more than the last guy.  And she goes, he was really funny, but he was more of a guy's comic.  Like, she did enjoy you, but you're very harsh for a young fucking girl.  Yeah.  And her head was not shaped good.  Oh, shit.  She had a really bad hairline.  And when she said he was a good comic, but more of a guy's comic, Otto said, yeah, well, 
[04:48:30]  you're really pretty, except for your forehead, it's too big.  And she was so hurt, she took her palm and she palmed Otto with a forehead.  Holy shit.  Wow, she must have been upset.  Dude, it was so uncomfortable and fucking great.  Good, good, good.  Fuck her.  She palmed Otto.  Did you like that?  It's one of my, said the worst thing to say.  I remember that exchange in the parking lot like it happened four minutes ago.  That's hilarious.  What did you laugh at more, me getting hit or her? 
[04:49:00]  The whole thing of it was, the fact that you just, you went to, you went, her making it  offhanded with Mark, you went right for the Achilles.  Yeah.  You sliced her Achilles.  And because you said forehead, she just palmed your forehead.  She didn't know how to handle it.  She didn't know how to react to it.  It was everything that she's ever been afraid a guy would say to her.  Right.  No guy has ever said that.  Like, they've all talked to her and looked up at her fucking bad hairline, but she sees  the eyes go up, but she's never actually had a guy say it to her. 
[04:49:30]  Wow.  Oh, man.  Except for your forehead, it's too big.  Absolutely.  Wow.  Yeah, in hindsight, she did try and spare my feelings by saying I'm a guy, kind of, and  all that.  She didn't know it was you at first for a second, but she really was, she was saying  that sincerely.  Yeah.  She just thought you were harsh, but funny.  God, I'm a vindictive, vicious asshole.  Fuck her hydrocephalous head.  She'll learn it's time to fucking think before she speaks.  You taught her a lesson.  That's why, this is what makes Otto, like, the comedian's favorite comedian, because he 
[04:50:00]  goes and gets smacked in his head in the parking lot, and he talks about what a funny story  it was.  There are a lot of people who would not enjoy repeating the fact that one of the audience  members was so upset by what they said that they had to physically assault them.  But Otto was a real comedian.  Chris in Jersey.  Hey, I was just wondering if you think that Nancy Grace believed that it was steroids that  killed Otto.  You know, I wouldn't be surprised if that miserable person decided to launch an investigation into 
[04:50:30]  the deaths of comedians, as many as we've had recently.  Well, again, I think Jim Florentine is going to be on the show tomorrow, so I'm sure we'll  talk more about it then.  Hopefully we'll get some more information, because I know when stuff like this happens, especially  with somebody, I guess people listen to this show regularly and religiously, and they kind  of, you feel close to the people that you hear on Opie and Anthony.  So everybody's going to want to know what happened with Otto, and we'll get that information 
[04:51:00]  to you as soon as humanly possible.  Shane in New York.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  I was on your show with Otto.  He brought me in just as a friend.  That guy was one of the best fucking guys.  I'm just beside myself right now, man.  I mean, and that's what I don't want people to lose, because he was such a brutal comic  that he's one of the sweetest guys that ever walked into the studio.  Absolutely.  I mean, for him to bring me on, because he liked the way I just told a story. 
[04:51:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm repeating myself.  I'm just freaking out, brother.  Yeah, well, good luck, man.  That's tough.  Joe in Jersey.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  How are you doing, buddy?  One of the best stories about Otto with the John Lennon thing is what had happened was  he was performing, and John Lennon's there with Yoko, and he's doing his thing, and John 
[04:52:00]  Lennon walks up to him and gives him two bucks.  He says, hey, $1.50 for the puppet and 50 cents for you, because you didn't do that much.  And the best part, the best part of it is that, and then as Lennon goes by, Lennon gives  him an elbow.  You know how, like, with your pals, you get a little boom.  He gives Otto, like, a shove.  And we were talking about it one day.  I'm like, Otto, man, what are you, a pussy?  Why'd you let him do that?  He's like, dude, he was a fucking penal.  Yeah.  What do you want me to do? 
[04:52:30]  If he was one of the monkeys, it would have been go time.  It's a really horrific, horrific day for us, you know, who were really tight with him,  and we're still trying to, you know, we're just still trying to come to grips with it,  but he's got so many great stories.  There are just so many hilarious and interesting things.  Hanging out with Belushi one night.  I mean, you know, he's just got so many great things, and he's so fascinating because  he just, one night we were doing a show somewhere, and some guy's sitting at a bar, and everybody's 
[04:53:00]  looking at the guy, and we all recognize the guy somewhere, and it was the guy who was  in Superman 2, one of the three villains.  You know the three villains?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.  Right?  It was the one that didn't speak, so we're all sitting there, and all of a sudden Otto's  like, I know you.  You're Jack O'Helloran from My Queen's Fair Lady, some movie from, like, 1963.  I'm like, who recognizes him from that?  Yeah, how would you know that?  How would you know that?  I gotta let you go, Joe, but we're running out of time, but I appreciate the call, dude. 
[04:53:30]  You got it, Sam.  All right, I'll talk to you later.  Good luck.  Bye.  And I see all the rest of you on hold right now.  I wish I could get to you, but I don't have time.  But yeah, so we'll get you more information as it comes.  Sal, can you put the bed on so I can organically go into a commercial after talking about the  memory of one of our great friends, Otto?  Yes.  Ahem.  Now moving on to the commercial.  Who is the only woman in your life to wipe your mouth and wipe your tears all in the
