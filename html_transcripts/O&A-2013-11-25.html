<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide array of topics, beginning with Thanksgiving week scheduling woes and transitioning into a robust critique of the American Music Awards (AMAs).  The hosts, Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton, along with Sam Roberts, heavily criticized Miley Cyrus's performance (featuring a giant kitten and near-exposure), Lady Gaga's sexually suggestive Oval Office skit with R. Kelly, and Katy Perry's allegedly racist Asian-themed performance.  Their commentary was frequently crude and sexually explicit.  They also discussed Macklemore's AMA performance and acceptance speech, expressing skepticism and using vulgar language to criticize his comments on racial injustice and Trayvon Martin, speculating on Jay-Z's silence on the matter.  Norton recounted personal frustrations with a broken phone, access card issues, and ongoing construction.  The show also included discussions of the New York Jets' poor performance and the New England Patriots' comeback, a long car ride with Norton's son watching *Frosty the Snowman*, and interactions with Twitter users. The segment concluded with Thanksgiving travel plans and a near-plane crash anecdote.

The show continued with jokes about the JFK assassination's 50th anniversary footage (including a humorous mention of Oswald tap-dancing), Jackie Kennedy's marriage to Aristotle Onassis (with crude jokes), and the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.  Lady Gaga's horse-riding appearance at an awards show was also the subject of crude humor.  A significant portion focused on the "knockout game," including a phone interview with a New York State legislator working to pass a law addressing it.  The hosts heavily criticized a CNN segment on the "knockout game" for its perceived lack of honesty and avoidance of racial demographics of perpetrators, engaging in heated debate with callers about self-preservation, racial profiling, and media sensationalism. A therapist, Steve, called in, agreeing with the hosts' assessment of the media's role.  The conversation also touched on Brian Griffin's death on *Family Guy* and *Doctor Who*.

A substantial segment debated the use of the n-word, sparked by comments from Charles Barkley and Bryant Gumbel.  Audio clips of both were played, showcasing their differing views on its contextual acceptability.  The discussion expanded to include its use in rap music by artists like YG and Drake, highlighting the perceived hypocrisy of radio stations censoring the word in song titles but playing the uncensored songs.  A caller, Mark, criticized the rappers' inauthenticity and suggested alternative artists.  The hosts debated the merits of various rappers, including Drake and Jay-Z.  Other topics interspersed included Opie's upcoming LA stand-up performance, the workplace holiday schedule, an upcoming winter storm, a humorous video of Shaq falling, and a segment featuring Alex Jones at a Dealey Plaza protest, presenting his perspective on police brutality. A Denver news anchorâ€™s critique of overuse of snow-covered patio furniture photos was also included.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Michael Jackson's death and comments from Conrad Murray.

A segment heavily featured sexually explicit jokes about Sam Roberts's supposed childhood experiences and a bizarre anecdote about his foreskin.  The conversation shifted to Mark Goodman's firing, Howard Stern's birthday party, and the hosts' consistent absence from the Super Bowl.  Dennis Falcone joined the studio, discussing his hair coloring and dental work, interspersed with more crude humor.  A phone call with Alex Jones followed, detailing an alleged police assault during a protest in Dallas and expanding on his conspiracy theories surrounding the JFK assassination, including alleged confessions and Lyndon B. Johnson's involvement.  A portion of a supposed deathbed confession related to the assassination was played, though largely unclear.  The segment ended with a MyPillow advertisement.

A lengthy interview with The Miz, a professional wrestler and reality TV star, dominated a later segment.  The interview covered his WWE career, his movie *Christmas Bounty*, his relationship with Maryse, locker room experiences (including hazing and the Richie Incognito controversy), his self-described arrogance, and the pressures of WWE. He discussed a concussion and subsequent depression.  Numerous advertisements for MyPillow, MagicJack, and Steven Singer Jewelers (which The Miz disliked) were interspersed. Callers asked about his WrestleMania 27 promo and future prospects, and one aspiring wrestler sought advice.  Sam Roberts engaged in playful banter with The Miz throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Opie's the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is he at me?  This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment. 
[00:00:30]  And having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio stuck hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people, real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Welcome aboard.  Well, that's, uh...  I think we're the only, uh, morning show working today.  Actually working?  When everybody breaks off for the Thanksgiving or something?  Thanksgiving week?  We don't get enough vacations, so we have to fucking squeeze these days out.  Eh, why not?  That's right.  Squeeze a few of these out.  Nothing better than getting up bright and early on a freezing cold morning for a... 
[00:01:30]  On a Monday morning.  Monday.  After a weekend.  Sure, sure.  You know what I'm going to do?  I'm turning this into Wednesday.  Because we're working three days this week, so we're up to Wednesday.  I thought the same thing driving in.  Fuck yeah.  I think it's Wednesday.  It is.  It's Wednesday.  Yeah.  This is the moment.  That was the weekend.  I like the Macklemore.  I can't stand Macklemore.  He's such a dick. 
[00:02:00]  This is the moment.  That's all I know.  Yeah.  Something about raise your hands up and, like, the ceiling can't hold us or something.  He's just for everything.  He's so, like, accepting.  I love him.  He's great.  That's good, right?  Nothing wrong with that.  Nothing wrong with a little love in the world.  In theory.  This is the moment.  There it is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  This was part of, what, the American Music Awards?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Mackle douche.  It's a very catchy song.  But that's not Macklemore, right?  Of course not.  Yes, that's Macklemore.  No, that's not Macklemore.  Singing the hook?  Yeah, the hook is the whole song, so.  No, that part's not Macklemore, no.  So that guy should get the credit.  Yeah.  The catchiest part of a song should get the credit.  Right.  What if Macklemore told that guy what to do?  I don't think he did, though.  Here goes Macklemore.  See?  I hate this.  This doesn't compare to the, this is the moment part. 
[00:03:00]  Just because you don't get these words going in your head.  If you can talk fast doesn't mean you're good.  It doesn't make it good if you can go fast.  Yeah, let's keep it all nice.  This is the moment.  What is that?  What is he doing?  What is Mark Goodman doing on our TV?  Free listening through December 3rd.  Oh, how's that working out for everybody?  He went in.  Apparently there's a big button on the controls.  Right.  Mars, that's in the engineering room, right?  Yeah.  Mars, what happens?  I never saw that button. 
[00:03:30]  You guys were too busy playing ping pong.  That's right.  You were distracted by your ping pong games, and Mark Goodman goes into that fucking room  and hits the big button to make, make what, old radios work or something?  It activates radios, inactive radios.  Oh, wow, that's great.  How come my sister had to be on the phone for two weeks trying to get her fucking radio  turned on?  Well, she had an old radio.  She should have told me how to just hit that button.  Why don't you take care of your sister?  I did.  I tried.  My family, they write me, my radio's out, and I pass it on, and they're good. 
[00:04:00]  They're not dealing with customer service.  It was a problem that a lot of people were having with the new or old radios in older  cars.  I have no idea.  All right.  But, you know.  She's set, though?  She's listening?  I pass her on to some people.  Did you just push her on to other people?  What am I going to do?  Grab a wrench and go into the fucking engineering room and start fucking turning some screwdrivers  in there?  You don't need a wrench.  You just got to hit the big button.  That's true.  Mark Goodman taught us that.  A big red button that turns the radio. 
[00:04:30]  Where's the big button around here for the management to listen to us?  Where's that giant button?  They hid that one.  Please let me know where it is so I can push it.  Why would they put the free radio button in perfect view of the window for all to see?  You'd think they'd put it somewhere a little more hidden.  You'd think it's small, subtle?  Like the boss listens to your button.  That one is well hidden.  Oh, yeah.  Nobody knows where that button is.  No, I don't even know where the boss has been lately. 
[00:05:00]  So, whatever.  I don't know.  Whatever.  It's the holidays coming up.  Come on.  Yay!  That's a good distraction until the new year.  Yay!  Yay!  Yeah, this year is over.  These two holidays bump right up against each other.  This year is over.  That's it.  This is like easy time now.  Doing nothing for a month and a half?  Yeah, because everyone's distracted.  Yeah.  Very distracted with the Thanksgiving thing.  And then, of course, you've got to set your alarm for 2.30 the next day to go and get a deal. 
[00:05:30]  2.30?  You've got to leave right at Thanksgiving dinner.  You've got to run out.  Right after dessert?  Dude, Walmart's doing specials this year.  Thanksgiving night.  Right.  6 p.m.  They expire at 7 p.m.  Right.  So, they're fucking up their workers Thanksgiving.  Of course they are.  Oh, yeah.  I read about that.  They're pissed off.  I don't blame them.  If you have people that are in your family that work in retail, you just might see them  for a second.  Right.  For the most part, you probably won't see them. 
[00:06:00]  Like my sister, she's worked in retail for years and years.  She, Thanksgiving's nothing.  It's like, oh, well, bye.  Bye.  You do realize those same sales will happen throughout the whole shopping season, right?  Exactly.  You slide in two days before Christmas.  It's amazing what you could get.  Oh, yeah.  Slide in all nice.  Start your Christmas shopping.  I heard that people are...  You take a deep breath as you open that door to the mall and have at it. 
[00:06:30]  They're already camping out.  No.  Put that on the news.  People camping out for their Black Friday sales.  They got tents out by some of the Best Buys and...  Oh, it's fantastic.  Those people are just looking for a picture for their Facebook.  That's what I think.  Look at me.  I'm first.  Look at me.  I'm first online.  Now I can get that DVD that my husband's been looking for.  I was in a DVD store in Philly this weekend.  Whoa.  It was extremely strange. 
[00:07:00]  What's that about?  F-Y-E.  What the fuck?  I thought all those stores closed down before Blockbuster.  Wow.  I actually saw an F-Y-E store.  What do they sell?  Fucking DVDs.  Who's using those?  I am.  For the car.  Oh.  For the car.  Oh.  For the kid.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I hear you.  Drove us fucking nuts on the way home yesterday watching Frosty the Snowman.  Oh, he's a holly jolly soul, that one.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  My son asked a million questions. 
[00:07:30]  What do you mean?  He wanted to know if Frosty had legs, and he wanted to know if Frosty had ears.  What?  Kid, watch the movie.  He's made of snow.  Yeah, yeah.  He's made of snow, man.  And then he goes, Frosty has arms.  I have arms.  Oh, that's good.  He's identifying things like arms.  And then we're like, I think Frosty has legs when he starts marching around the joint.  And then he goes, I have legs, too.  We're like, yeah, we know.  We know.  Yeah, got that.  Frosty gets legs when...  Go back to your movie.  It's a long weekend and a long drive. 
[00:08:00]  Please be quiet for two minutes.  Thank you.  When the breeze comes in, right?  Yeah.  He gets his legs and starts marching around.  Yeah, they do the little march thing.  Yeah.  I want to be a dentist.  Oh, God.  That was the Rudolph one.  Oh, right.  The long version of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is monotonous as all hell.  Yeah.  It takes forever.  Did I use my gift card from FYE?  No, I did not.  I do have an FYE gift card somewhere.  Wow, where'd you get that?  I don't know. 
[00:08:30]  Years ago.  It's in my gift card drawer.  You should hold that like a time capsule.  Right.  Right.  That's a collector's item now.  I look down.  The guy, I go, you guys are closing down, right?  He actually goes, no.  He goes, we're doing really well because we're like the flagship for the entire Northeast or something.  But how many people are really?  Because you need one place in every city that still has the DVDs for people that are a little behind.  But there was an FYE by me a couple years ago, and I went in to sell like 200 DVDs. 
[00:09:00]  And they gave me like a dollar each or something, which was still Righteous Box.  Righteous, yes.  Cheapskate.  But I go, so are you guys closing down or are you doing?  No, we're doing okay.  Six months later, they were gone.  Of course they're gone.  Of course.  Yeah, I'm surprised Blockbuster lasted as long as it did.  Like who the fuck was the last few people going like, oh, who was upset about Blockbuster closing?  Like, oh no, where am I going to get my stuff?  How about going into the Blockbuster when it was like 75% off and there was nothing fun to grab? 
[00:09:30]  No, no.  You know, the last movie they rented at Blockbuster or sold at Blockbuster was, right?  That's the end?  Yeah.  Isn't that funny?  It's hilarious.  They are funny.  Oh.  Yeah.  Long weekend in Philly.  I gotta wake the fuck up.  Oh, you're in Philly.  What'd you get at FYE?  No.  What do you think?  Frosty the Stoeman.  Oh. 
[00:10:00]  The Holiday Favorites.  Oh, Rosty.  And I think the first Muppets movie.  Oh.  I don't think we have the one yet.  Frosty the Stoeman.  This isn't in the movie.  What?  That's what it says here on the soundtrack.  Is it Leon Redbone?  I don't think so.  No, this isn't in the movie.  Eric.  Why would you play the original?  Because this is what it said on the album selection for.  A little research, buddy.  A little research.  Oh, boy.  That didn't take me a lot. 
[00:10:30]  You don't know Frosty the Stoeman?  I usually just watch Rudolph.  You like Rudolph?  Usually.  Like, you just go home.  Usually.  Because that's what's usually on.  Usually.  That and Charlie Brown Christmas.  Doctor Who.  Right.  Enough with Doctor Who.  And then we're driving through the Lincoln Tunnel.  And then my young son points out that's the same Lincoln Tunnel that Elf walks through.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  With the Christmas movies.  Or is it the Holland Tunnel?  I don't even know what tunnel the fucking Elf walked through. 
[00:11:00]  I just tell them it's the Lincoln Tunnel, the same one we used to go to Philly.  Yeah.  It's great when they notice things, right?  Oh, God.  They notice every single thing.  Curse words?  Yeah.  A few curse words.  A few curse words.  Sure.  I think that's always funny.  Yeah, it is.  Curse and kids.  Hilarious.  And then the stupid fucking Jets looked horrendous.  Oh, I was reading some tweets.  They looked horrendous.  Yeah.  We just want a halfway decent season so we can move on here.  They looked horrible. 
[00:11:30]  Who were they playing?  I don't have any idea.  The Dodgers.  The Dodgers?  Oh, that's just Dodgers.  They should have won.  They really should have.  The Dodgers.  What?  They should have won, yeah.  That was the Ravens.  Ravens.  Ah.  They're a good team, but still, the fucking Jets.  Jets have a really good defense.  Their offense is all over the fucking place.  I guess the Giants couldn't rally, keep their win streak alive.  Yeah, but they had such a ridiculous shot at the playoffs. 
[00:12:00]  I guess it's officially over now for the Giants, right?  And then the Patriots and Broncos.  I saw part of the game, and it turned out to be an amazing game.  Yeah.  The Patriots were down 24 zip and came all the way back.  And then won it in overtime.  How do you allow a team to do that?  You're just waking up and you don't know that.  There you go.  How do you let a team do that to you?  I don't know.  You just fall apart?  But then the Broncos came back a bit to tie it, and then OT, and blah, blah, blah.  Blah, blah, blah. 
[00:12:30]  And there you have it.  There's our sports break.  Your sports wrap-up.  We're concise.  Yes.  So what happened on the AMAs?  I was telling Anthony, this Miley Cyrus, everyone's looking at her performances, but there's too many of these shows.  So every show, you've got to outdo the prior performance.  Well, she didn't outdo her camel toe twerking.  She didn't outdo her joint smoking.  Right.  That she did for the European MTV Awards.  But by the way, the joint smoking was to outdo her earlier performance when she was spanking a midget. 
[00:13:00]  Right, right, right.  Well, you know, you've got to...  I would just do the same act at all the award shows.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to fucking twerk again, and you guys are going to talk about it.  Like a teddy bear's asshole.  Exactly.  All that shit.  Remember this?  What is this one?  This is last night.  Yeah.  So how did she perform last night?  Well, usually she does Wrecking Ball with a big video screen behind her with her face  on it crying. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  But she switched it up.  Okay.  Yeah.  Who's that?  Will Smith's kid?  That's Jaden Smith and 2 Chainz.  2 Chainz!  Motherfucking 2 Chainz!  2 Chainz.  I like the 2 Chainz.  Titty boy.  Yeah.  Kylie Cyrus.  Man, they're making that kid famous, huh?  They're trying.  Yeah, they're trying really hard.  They're giving them their best shot.  Giving them the best projects in Hollywood and everything.  Oh, it's the cute little cat kitten that's standing on his hind legs. 
[00:14:00]  It's just a giant kitten behind her in space.  It's a mean kitten.  Holy shit.  Look what she's wearing.  She loves wearing those...  She's got some sweet ligaments in that upper leg.  You can see it all.  What the fuck?  She loves wearing those bottoms that just about cover her pussy lips.  Well, yeah.  But almost like not quite.  Right.  And the little kitten picture is lip syncing and blinking its big sad eyes. 
[00:14:30]  This is all she did?  Yeah.  She's just staying next to a giant kitten in outer space.  Yeah, why not?  With her vagina almost showing.  Why would she have the kitten lip syncing?  Well, it kind of is.  It is.  I don't think so.  The lip syncing is off.  Well, it's a kitten, so...  Yeah.  Well, you can figure that shit out, though, in post.  All right, whatever.  Yeah, that was her big thing last night.  Not quite as provocative...  No. 
[00:15:00]  ...as everything else she's done.  She's calming it down a little bit.  But it was a very, like, what the fuck are we watching?  Yeah.  It's kind of funny.  Kind of cute thing she's doing.  What was the big performance last night?  This...  Well...  I saw the Lady Gaga fucking Robert Kelly performance.  What?  He's the black president, and she's some, like, hua?  That's right.  And they're having sex in the Oval Office or something?  That was...  And then, somewhere in there, she sings her song, right?  Well, yeah.  Believe it or not, in a Lady Gaga song, she turned the whole thing into a high school play. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  You just never see that.  Just completely over the top and obnoxious.  Of course.  She loves those productions.  Yeah.  We don't need to see that.  All right, good.  What else?  And then, the other one...  Oh, boy.  ...was...  I've read a few different articles.  People are trying to figure out whether or not they're going to call Katy Perry racist.  Okay.  Oh, we're still working on that?  Yeah, that consensus hasn't been reached yet.  Well, she's part of the big three.  Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry. 
[00:16:00]  But she's too beloved to call racist.  Yeah, but then she came out in...  Blackface?  Asian face.  Oh, Asian face.  And I guess she mixed some Chinese and Japanese things.  Can't do that.  You're not allowed.  No.  All right.  Nope.  Just throw all your Asian shit together.  Why not?  It's crazy.  Why not?  Have a little medley.  Oh, boy.  An Asian medley.  She's done.  An Asian cornucopia.  Why not?  I would take the rounder eyes from the Koreans.  Oh, here she is. 
[00:16:30]  She's doing some kind of...  Although the Koreans don't have the round eyes.  It's the Japanese, right?  See, I don't even know.  I have no idea at this point.  Who has the, you know...  What's that?  Who has the...  Oh.  I can't see, but...  Who has the eyes that, you know, looks like you're looking into the sun?  Which one?  I'm not sure.  Chinese?  Or the Koreans?  My instinct says Chinese, but I can't be sure.  I think the entire, you know...  Which one looks like they're walking around on a really sunny day? 
[00:17:00]  Japanese, that's like a cloudy day.  We all know that.  Yeah, right.  Right.  That's obvious.  But which one is like, you know, not a cloud in the sky?  August of 45, there was...  Which one?  Bright light over there.  Yeah.  Oh, my boy.  But which one?  High noon?  Yeah, I think we could discuss this a little bit.  Um...  Hmm.  Oh, she's doing like a kabuki thing.  Yeah.  All right.  Geisha?  How do they say that? 
[00:17:30]  Geisha.  Geisha girls.  So what's the problem here?  What is the problem?  And is she roaring here?  No, this is her new song, Unconditionally.  Why would she sing this one?  This is the hit, and Roar is over.  No, Roar is still happening.  On commercials.  Yeah, but she doesn't need to sell Roar anymore.  Roar is not selling any more albums.  So what's the problem?  She's mixing Japanese and Chinese.  Yeah, plus she isn't Japanese or Chinese.  So?  And she's kind of trying to look that way. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  Kind of.  So?  Oh, so we got some Chinese stuff going on.  And then you got like a fucking samurai, and then you got like...  Right.  Oh, boy.  This is the most racist thing I've ever seen.  That's what I was thinking.  So disturbing.  Like one blog was going as far as to say,  Well, the kimono is Japanese, but the collar is Chinese.  Ha, ha, ha.  I was like, come on.  What about the titties?  The titties are neither.  Oh, the titties are Japanese.  Really?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:18:30]  The Japanese know how to...  Get some titties going?  Yeah, they get their titties going.  What the hell is going on?  So why is this racist?  It's too Asian.  For who?  Because she's not Asian.  She's not Asian.  But no one dresses like that anyway.  You're not allowed to pay homage or tribute to any nationalities or cultures anymore if you're not a member of that culture.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Well, Katy Perry's doing it.  Well...  With a horrible song, by the way.  She'll pay.  This song stinks. 
[00:19:00]  You didn't even listen to it.  She should have started with this one and then go with Roar as her second hit.  You gotta have to bang her out of the gate.  Is she trying to make her eyes look Asian or what?  I think maybe with the eyebrows there.  Yeah, a little...  See how they're angled a little bit?  She's got retard bangs, too.  True.  What's up with that?  Which some people say are Asian bangs.  Well...  Yeah, I don't know.  It sounds like Wrecking Ball. 
[00:19:30]  Wrecking Ball.  Wrecking Ball.  A little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Came in like a wrecking ball.  Yeah.  All right.  That shit.  All right, it's harmless.  Who cares?  So the AMAs were no big deal.  It's basically blackface.  It's blackface for Asians.  Yes.  Why is that?  More offensive.  More offensive.  Yes.  Wow.  Why is that?  Bold statement.  I don't know.  Who's calling her out on that?  There's a bunch of blogs that are calling her out on it.  Blogs?  Blogs.  Blogs.  What's a blog?  It's like a blog.  It's like a log. 
[00:20:00]  Blog.  Log and log.  Hi, Jimmy.  How are you?  Mr. Norton.  Fucking 605, I was in front of the building.  For a cab?  No.  Oh, no.  If I'm serious, in the cab, getting out, and I realized, something feels weird about my  travel bag.  Right.  I'm like, oh, I don't have my phone, which I need, so I'm flying.  So I go home, I get my phone, I knock my fucking home phone off the thing while I'm  scrambling to unplug my phone.  Right.  I break my home phone.  Why'd you break your home phone?  It was a mistake.  Something about a phone.  There was a phone.  What a phone issue.  And then I get back here, and the fucking, I go up to 37. 
[00:20:30]  And then my card won't swipe, so I'm just standing up there.  Oh, my God.  Hitting, I wanted to fucking, I almost had a meltdown upstairs in the glass thing.  Right.  You're on video.  You can't break shit.  Oh, my God.  That would have been great.  That would have been hilarious.  What a great video.  That would have been hilarious.  You're trapped, trapped in a glass cage, just banging on the fucking door.  No, the other side's open.  The other side works fine.  When you walk in the main side, because I couldn't get back around to where the steps  are, because everything's walled off.  Yes.  Because they're doing construction.  How about you pick a fucking floor?  Walled off the floor.  Fuck, you got me right out of that mood. 
[00:21:00]  Putting the stone in, man.  The stone looks great.  Yeah, it's terrific.  It's supposed to be done today.  Cool.  It's amazing, the stone.  Apparently not.  Online app, not so much.  But the stone, the stone work looks amazing.  Is there still a problem with the app?  I have to read.  I got a few emails and a couple of tweets, I guess.  All weekend long.  All weekend long.  But the stone work, my God, it's beautiful.  It's lovely.  Fucking amazing.  Who cares, right? 
[00:21:30]  Your Cowboys won.  Congratulations.  Yeah, I watched some of the game.  I still think we're all done.  He marched down the field for you guys.  Well, that defense just sucks a dick.  But Roman did his job.  It's usually him fucking it up.  Yeah, he did.  He did.  And the 11th game or something.  It's fine.  I almost hope they get to the playoffs just so we can ruin it in the first round.  It always does.  Let's see.  They had a 21-3 lead, didn't they?  Or was it 21-6?  I don't know. 
[00:22:00]  I wasn't really watching that one.  They had a good lead.  I was just watching the Jets look really bad.  And a little red zone action, so a few plays, I guess.  If I comment on something, they're like, why aren't you watching football, you faggot?  Yeah, okay.  I guess I should watch football.  I guess that makes you a faggot.  Uh-huh.  People just like commenting, that's all.  I know. 
[00:22:30]  They're nice people.  No, for the most part, they're a bunch of scumbags.  I can't stand fucking Twitter people.  They're very nice people.  Yeah.  I don't think so.  Huh?  I don't think they are.  No.  No, Twitter people are fucking dickbags, for the most part.  There's a couple of nice people, but it's the exception to the rule.  Everyone with their voice.  I'm going to start buttoning my fly, I decided.  That's a new thing. 
[00:23:00]  Why?  What?  I just stood up and buttoned my fly like a gentleman.  For what?  Because I was...  I realized I don't button my fly, and I got caught in that UFC photo.  With two fucking real men.  Well, you're just buttoning the top?  As you fly open?  Yeah.  Not drastically where you see, you know, tighty-whities or anything, but you can tell it's open.  Maybe I should start buttoning my fly.  I do prefer the zipper more than the button fly. 
[00:23:30]  I've got to be honest.  It's just so much faster.  Yeah.  Easier.  Taking your calls.  What do you like better, the zipper or the button fly?  And then I guess AMA's Macklemore.  A little controversy they're talking about on the news channels.  I see him popping up.  Oh, yeah.  A little controversy.  What's the controversy?  How about we avoid the controversy?  Yeah?  What's the problem?  Well, he...  I guess he was saying something about Trayvon. 
[00:24:00]  I don't know.  A lot of people think Trayvon got a bad deal.  Yeah, I know.  A lot of people think that.  Yeah.  So he was speaking up about it.  Well, yeah.  Wait, Trayvon got a bad deal?  Trayvon Martin?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What was his head?  He said, you know, that...  Let's just play it.  How long is this thing?  It's not long.  It's his acceptance speech.  Oh.  Because he won Best Rap Artist.  Oh, did he?  Who did he beat out?  I don't know who was nominated.  Boy, is he clawing to gain acceptance in the black community.  Of course he did, yeah. 
[00:24:30]  So he'll throw out anything.  Yeah, but you were right.  He wants acceptance in every community.  Yes, yes.  Because last time it was the gays.  Well, that means more record sales.  Yeah, right.  He liked the gays.  Right.  Loves the gays.  Yeah.  You get everyone on your side, you could sell a lot of units.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Can't say records anymore.  Units.  Yes.  Sell a lot of downloads.  But they were in Florida.  Is McElroy like an Irish guy?  It's Macklemore.  Is McElroy...  Oh, McElroy's the golfer.  I don't know who McElroy... 
[00:25:00]  Yeah, McElroy may be Irish, but...  I'd rather watch McElroy than McElmore myself.  What is he, Irish?  You like golf.  I don't know where he's from.  Golf.  Golf.  Golf.  Golf.  Golf.  Golf.  That's how you say the word.  Best pick.  Golf.  That's how you say the gas station.  Golf.  Golf.  Golf.  Golf.  Golf.  Golf.  Golf.  Oh, golf.  Maybe it looks...  Dull.  Maybe it looks...  Maybe it looks like golf, but it's golf.  Golf.  Yeah, we took a lot of words and made it our own in America. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  What the fuck is wrong with that?  You got fucked up living in London, man, or wherever the fuck you were for a few years.  That fucked up your whole world.  Your whole speech pattern, everything.  I say words correctly for the most part.  You eat like shit because you lived over there.  Yeah.  That's not why.  Because they eat like shit.  They do.  Wow, the Polar Girl Club rules.  They got a little fucking...  How cold is it?  A little chub on a couple of them to keep warm.  I like that.  Yeah, I like that too. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  That's Green Bay for you right there.  Oh, yeah.  And Green Bay Packers bikinis.  Go pack gold.  It was freezing up there.  Bikini clad, cheeseheads, brave, frigid temperatures.  That's a big story on Fox right now.  Nice.  Don't wash your dick and give them a little fucking cheese head.  Yeah.  See, because it's cheesy, ew.  It's just disgusting.  Let's do the Macklemore.  Here's the acceptance speech. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, Macklemore.  Here's the acceptance speech from Macklemore and Ryan Lewis.  All right.  Wow, that is amazing.  First of all, hello to everybody.  Thank you to the AMAs.  It has been an absolutely incredible year.  I feel extremely blessed to be accepting an award at the AMAs.  And now that I'm sitting here in front of millions of people, I'd like to address something  extremely important to me. 
[00:27:00]  Oh.  I was talking to my friend, O'Warby.  You don't like the start of it?  My fucking stomach hurts already.  Here he goes.  He's got some things to say.  I know.  How about you sing about it?  You already have an art form.  There you go.  How about you sing about it?  No, he's got to do something very important to say.  I'll be accepting an award at the AMAs.  And now that I'm sitting here in front of millions of people, I'd like to address something  extremely important to me.  I was talking to my friend, O'War, before the show, and he reminded me of a great Martin 
[00:27:30]  Luther King quote.  Did they?  He said, injustice anywhere.  By the way, he had to pick a name that was definitely not a white guy.  Right.  War.  And so they just hang out backstage trading Martin Luther King quotes and stuff.  Who does that?  Party fest.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who's that guy?  Who is the guy he's referring to anyway?  Just some dude.  I don't know.  Is it one of his crew?  Probably.  Does he have a crew?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm embarrassed for this guy.  He is embarrassing.  That's embarrassing. 
[00:28:00]  You know how poor we'd be if we had a crew?  Like these guys?  Oh, man.  Fuck.  Why would you do that?  A crew?  Entourage.  They're getting money.  I want a crew.  You want a crew?  Yeah.  I want to have a whole crew walking with me.  It's Jim and the crew.  Some of us just walk around lonely by ourselves.  Yeah.  A crew would be nice.  I knock tentatively.  Like, I want someone to just open the door and they're like, oh, there's Jim in the middle  of this crew.  Like an entourage.  Big group.  Important. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Pretty nice.  That's a quote Malcolm X at award shows.  The great Gandhi once said, all right.  Luke the King.  Macklemore.  Here it goes.  All right.  I'll be accepting an award at the AMAs.  And now that I'm sitting here in front of millions of people, I'd like to address something  extremely important to me.  That's true.  I was talking to my friend award before the show, and he reminded me of a great Martin  Luther King quote.  He said, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. 
[00:29:00]  And due to the fact that we are in Florida tonight accepting this award, I want to acknowledge  it's Trayvon Martin and the hundreds and hundreds of kids each year that are dying due to racial  profiling.  Oh, my fucking God.  It's a drop in the pocket compared to the black on black gang crime.  Hundreds of kids dying.  What a groveling.  Oh, he really is trying very, very hard to. 
[00:29:30]  Well, if he said something about gun violence, I would at least, or at least he's saying  something, but the racial, how come you're not mentioning gun violence because everybody  else in your fucking genre sings about it so you didn't want to go there and you figure  that was a safe way?  This guy sucks.  And he can't talk about gang violence either because they like, you know, rap fans enjoy  hearing about gangs.  This is people in gangs that buy his fucker or steal his records.  Wow, wait.  We need a fraud alert sound. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, really.  This is just, he's a fraud.  Fraud alert.  A fraud is a fraud.  We can get that.  Oh, God.  You think he's trying a little too hard here?  I'm so embarrassed for him.  It reminds me of me when I was 16 and drunk with my black friends trying to say black things.  It doesn't feel like a real moment going down, that's all.  No, no, he's trying.  I was trying, I was backstage talking to my black friend and we mentioned a great black  man who had a great quote and it's going to be about another black man and I'll mention 
[00:30:30]  more bad things that white people are doing to black people.  That's it, exactly.  Crabbling idiots.  You know, we didn't land on Plymouth Rock.  Plymouth Rock landed on us.  I'm reminded.  Yes.  I'm reminded by a great quote by Jimmy J.J. Walker.  And dynamite!  This runs out of things to say.  Reminded by a great quote by a man in the Chicago Projects named James Evans.  Oh, no, Florida Evans.  And she said, damn, damn, damn. 
[00:31:00]  Fucking boo.  He really is.  Let's listen to the rest of it.  Boo.  Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.  Damn.  And due to the fact that we are in Florida tonight accepting this award, I want to acknowledge  Trayvon Martin and the hundreds and hundreds of kids each year that are dying.  Thousands and thousands.  And the violence that follows it.  This is really happening.  These are our friends, our neighbors, our peers and our fans. 
[00:31:30]  And it's time that we look out for the youth and fight against racism and the laws that protect it.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  And the laws that protect it.  Thank you so much to our family, our friends and our incredible fans.  There you go.  Thank you.  Yeah.  The guy would thank his family and friends.  There you go.  That's nice, right?  Macklemore's a cunt.  What a cunt.  Because I don't believe.  It's just.  It's such.  It seems.  He's a hack.  That's a hack emotion. 
[00:32:00]  But a hack.  A hack poignant acceptance speech.  We have to fight racism.  Really?  Uh-oh.  1970?  Shut up.  He's like how Miley Cyrus has to out-crazy yourself at every award show.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  At the VMAs, he was supporting the gays.  Right.  So now the AMAs come up, and he's like, oh, who am I going to support this time?  And this time it's the blacks.  So, how about he just says thank you?  Thanks, everybody.  Let his music do the talking.  Yeah.  Do the talking. 
[00:32:30]  Thanks for buying the music.  God, he makes me.  That's embarrassing.  That is embarrassing.  The whole thing is filled with corn balls.  Oh, my God.  They really are.  Everyone's trying for their moment.  This is the moment.  See?  He was going for that.  The moment.  Yeah, he was going for the moment.  I wish Jay-Z had won.  He could have just plugged his new collection of Barney's.  Everything would have been fine.  He wants everybody to see him and go, yo, man, that was good.  He'd go, yo, it had to be said.  You know, just saying what has to be said, yo.  Would he say it like that?  Yeah, he would.  Yeah, right.  He'd be quiet about it. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  Was Jay-Z there?  I wouldn't think so.  Oh.  No.  Oh, he doesn't acknowledge the AMA?  I mean, come on.  Is he walking around with his head down as black people look at him going, why the fuck  didn't you support us in this one?  No.  He's fine.  Dude, that's bad.  He doesn't give a fuck.  You know it's bad, though, right?  He's all about the black cause, but when it comes to the money.  Yeah, but dude, he'll just put out.  Don't take Jay-Z's money.  He'll put out another song and everything will be fine.  You're going to take his money?  But I think they're looking at him like, Jay-Z, what the fuck? 
[00:33:30]  You were supposed to be behind this one.  But he didn't want to yank those fucking clothes out of there.  Oh, hand that.  No fucking way.  I like it, though, because Reverend Al Sharpton is left just standing there going, what the  fuck, Jay-Z?  What happened?  Come on.  You were supposed to join me behind this podium.  We were doing some things together.  But Reverend Al won't go after Jay-Z, really?  No.  Of course not.  Yeah, where's Reverend Al?  Way too powerful.  Reverend Al had to go away because Jay-Z didn't jump on the cause with him.  Right.  It's over.  Right, so you had to find something new. 
[00:34:00]  Exactly.  They always bully advertisers, right, to threaten their products when they want radio guys to  do something.  So how about you go after Jay-Z and threaten his music?  Oh, that's my shit, motherfucker.  Jay-Z would be like, what the fuck are you talking about?  I'd be like, I'm sorry, Jay-Z.  I was shut up.  But how did Jay-Z handle this?  What was his statement that made it all okay in his mind?  In the beginning, he said, let's wait until all the facts are out.  Right.  And then just ducked and weaved. 
[00:34:30]  The facts are out.  Goodbye.  The facts are out.  It's a little ugly.  Yeah.  For the black man.  He knows the story will just go away.  He says, we'll wait until the facts are out.  And in that time period, the story goes away.  Right.  He says, we wait until the facts are out.  Then he jumps on a plane to Turks and Caicos.  Comes back in a month.  Nice.  He's got a new single and everything's fine.  Everything's fine and dandy.  Is that where he is?  What are you going to do?  I don't know.  Probably.  Why'd you say Turks and Caicos?  He loves it there.  I love it there.  But he's on the special island, I bet.  Probably.  He's a special island.  Is he?  For the biggies. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you get on that island?  You're big enough to get on that island.  It's a special island.  No whites allowed.  Oh.  This is the moment.  That's a good song.  Love it.  Why does he have to try to be meaningful?  Just because you can't have any meaning in your music, don't bore us at the award show.  Well, that's why, though.  You're right.  This song couldn't be more basic.  Yeah.  I think it's about in the club and you're partying.  Oh, aren't they all?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like Malcolm X said.  No, it doesn't fit.  Sing about it. 
[00:35:30]  Dummy, you're an artist.  What was the Pitbull doing at the American?  He was the host.  He's good, that guy.  I thought so.  He sucks.  Why is he a host now?  He's the worst dude ever.  Pitbull is fucking fat.  Was Taylor Swift very thankful when she got her award?  I'll tell you, she was surprised.  She was so surprised.  I can't believe this was happening to her.  After 15 years, I think it's time to believe us.  Look.  Oh, my God.  I couldn't believe her.  She thanked Idi Amin.  It was really bizarre.  Her act is getting fucking thin, too. 
[00:36:00]  She's approaching middle age.  It's not like it's this crazy thing happening to a teenager.  Exactly.  Yeah, just a fresh-faced kid in the business.  Why'd she perform in front of a cat?  Because she's fucking Raleigh Cyrus.  What else is she supposed to do?  She showed her hiney hole and she fucking licked midget ass.  Yeah.  Now it's like, ah.  This is all she's got left.  I mean, she's licked assholes and done drugs.  Right.  Now she's just going to perform in front of a giant cat.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Who's that?  That's R. Kelly and Gaga. 
[00:36:30]  That's a dumb Gaga bro.  I like her, but I like this song.  What's this song called?  American Nightmare?  Jesus.  Yeah.  So that's supposed to be the president?  Yes, R. Kelly is the president.  They went through a whole performance before the song even started.  Didn't he tinkle on a girl in a video at one point that might have been underage?  But then they said she was.  Yes, he did.  Someone had a funny tweet.  They said, Lady Gaga, SNL is over.  She's still doing sketches.  It really is like SNL skits.  I heard she did all right on SNL, but just sing your stupid song. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I heard she was funny.  Someone said she was really good.  Yeah, she got rave reviews.  I still haven't watched her.  I haven't TVR'd.  Well, yeah, I mean, she's like a drama kid, all grown up, you know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She still wants to, you know, put on a little show.  Hey, gang, let's put on a show.  Let's put on a show and raise money for the cause.  She's very talented.  Oh, boy.  Not as much as the Katy Perry.  No, she's more talented than Katy Perry.  No, she's not Katy Perry.  She's better than Katy Perry.  She is. 
[00:37:30]  Katy Perry's okay.  Katy Perry has way more hits.  She does, probably, but it doesn't matter.  I don't know if she does.  Way more hits.  What's her big song?  The fireworks?  War?  She's a goody gumdrops.  She is, that's true.  Goody gumdrops?  Language.  Yeah, she's a goody gumdrop.  Oh, look, here's Katy singing about happiness.  Oh, clouds are good.  What?  Nobody refers to Katy Perry as their mother.  No, I don't either.  Lady Gaga is.  Who is she?  She's Mama Monster.  God, how embarrassing.  Why?  I'm a little monster.  Industry's embarrassing.  Jesus. 
[00:38:00]  It's also stupid.  They all have to name their fans now.  That's the big thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We have names.  We do?  We're little monsters.  Yes, we are.  It's like Hulkamaniacs.  That's true.  I don't want to be bad.  That hangnail didn't work out too well.  Out.  Hold it down a little too far.  That hurts.  Man, that fucking hurts.  Isn't this offensive that she's having some type of relationship with the black president 
[00:38:30]  guy?  First of all, interracial relationships are no longer offensive.  No, I don't mean the interracial relationship part.  Most of us got past that one.  Yeah, we're all okay with it.  I don't mean...  We're all right, because it doesn't bother us personally, so we don't give a fuck.  I don't mean that.  Man's still trying to cover up those three civil rights murders in Mississippi.  I mean the part with, like, just the office of the president there, you know.  I don't know.  I don't think there was an official seal, so...  Oh, yeah?  Is that what it takes?  But it's fairly well known that there's sexual conduct happening in the... 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, but Bill Clinton kind of ended that role.  But we don't know if he's the president of the United States.  He could just be the president of, like, I don't know.  Oh, the NLBACP.  Like an Ikea or something.  See, there's no...  Ikea.  They weren't brave enough to do an official seal.  I don't know.  That desk looks like the desk.  It's got the eagle on the front.  American Fly, yellow curtains.  I don't know.  But notice they didn't put any type of seal.  They weren't brave.  Yeah.  Even if the official seal was different.  I mean, I think he is supposed to be the president of the United States of America, but...  I wouldn't assume. 
[00:39:30]  Having sex with the president is no longer a taboo thing, since it was actually...  But they weren't really having sex in that video.  They were just kind of dry-humping.  Yeah, you could dry-hump.  They were blue-balling.  You think Michelle would be fine with that?  In the oral office.  Dry-humping with Lady Gaga?  I don't like when Mama Monster's smutty.  You know?  No.  You like her to be clean?  I like Mama Monster to just sing and rock out. 
[00:40:00]  You want to talk about someone that's predictable.  She is.  No.  Oh, God.  She thought she was going to be banging the black president?  She doesn't believe half that shit she says.  Stop it.  I don't love this song, though.  The R. Kelly one, I think.  No?  Yeah.  Yeah, but I like watching them mock have sex.  Oh, yeah?  Same thing they did on SNL.  That album's going to be a bust.  It really isn't.  Sold a billion copies.  Catching on.  Yep, that's a bust.  A billion.  I'm buying one.  I don't think it's a billion.  In this day and age, a billion.  It's a drop in the bucket.  I think it sold 250,000 the first week.  Is that a lot? 
[00:40:30]  Nope.  Not by her standards.  What's a big one?  What would Katie Parris sell the first week?  At least twice that.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You've got to go platinum, yo, for a million.  Yeah, people can sell a million records in a week.  It's rare.  Yeah, I've done that.  No, you haven't, Chip.  What's half a million is gold, right?  Yeah, I think so.  Gold ain't shit no more.  You get a gold record, you're a piece of shit.  Isn't it different with a double album, too?  It counts both records as...  Yeah, it counts double. 
[00:41:00]  Each sale counts twice.  Why not put out, like, four albums set?  Or 500,000 albums set.  It's good gold immediately.  No one buys it.  One person.  Sell one copy.  That would be ridiculous.  Yeah, no one would go for that.  No room to store it.  But she's also, like, only doing 80s throwback songs now.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like, when she was having massive hits, at least they sounded fucking crazy.  Like, that Bad Romance song was like, what the fuck is this?  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Alexandro.  Alejandro. 
[00:41:30]  But then, like, now she's just doing kind of throwback 80s dance songs.  Do you know what I've been listening to a lot lately?  Oh.  Um, it's off the second record.  Mm-hmm.  It's, um, not Judas, and, uh, Americano I like.  I know that song.  I've been listening to that a lot.  Oh, no.  Like, twice in a row sometimes.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  You love it?  I love when Mama Monster sings about naughty things.  What is it about?  She's, I think she wants to eat this girl's box that she met.  Um, she likes this chick.  It's about women getting married or whatever. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  Can't marry her, and, you know, they speak the language of, I guess, fucking love, whatever.  Yeah.  Lovely song.  Why is this guy losing his job because he fought off a robber?  I don't know.  Oh, my God.  I guess it's, um...  You're on the fire.  A clerk loses his job for fighting off a robber.  You're not allowed to fight?  I guess not.  I guess you're not supposed to, uh, duke it out with the old robber.  Did the robber have a gun?  I don't know.  Oh.  Well, he was dressed like that.  He's got a towel.  How'd they know he was a robber? 
[00:42:30]  Over his head and sunglasses and rubber gloves on.  Would you just hate your life at that moment if someone like that walked in the store you were in?  Dude, you can...  I've been in that situation once.  That's right.  You were.  I forgot about that.  And you immediately know there's a problem.  It's August.  They have on heavy winter jackets.  Oh, Jesus.  It's very scary.  Yeah.  Where were you again?  McDonald's?  McDonald's in North Brunswick.  McDonald's?  McDonald's in North Brunswick.  What did they order?  They had a side order of cash register and a little extra get the fuck up in front, Whitey, and stand there. 
[00:43:00]  You guys all had to get up and stand in the front?  Yeah, but it was frightening because you realize how powerless you are.  The one guy waving the pistol went into the back and was screaming at the fucking person.  Open the motherfucking safe!  Screaming.  Shit, yo.  Why didn't you make a run for it?  Because there was other guys.  There was one guy blocking the front door.  Holy shit.  And this one black woman that worked there was like,  And she just ran out.  Oh, man.  And then that door got blocked.  It was like three of them.  One guy watching the people up front. 
[00:43:30]  It was at night, so it wasn't full.  It might have been ten people there.  And me and my girlfriend, we were sitting in the window facing out,  and he grabbed us and says,  Let's go, let's go!  And he moved us up to the front, and my girlfriend fell.  And I was just...  She had given me back then...  I had like $150 of her money in my pocket,  which was a fucking lot of money when I was 19.  And I just told her to just look down.  Run your pockets.  Run your pockets!  No, but the guy watching us was okay, though.  He's like,  Hey, you're not going to get hurt.  Just stand here.  It's going to be okay.  He was actually...  He saw me a bunch of fucking fighting funny rabbits. 
[00:44:00]  But I was just scared they were going to rape my girlfriend.  I was like,  Are they going to take her and fucking rape her?  And not let you watch her?  Exactly.  Not let me fucking...  Yo, man, get the cracker.  All right, at least this is working out.  You're not with the girl anymore.  No, we broke up probably a long time after...  Not long after that,  because as they were leaving,  I'm like,  You sure you don't want to dip a little?  That's crazy.  That's a horrible story, man.  No one got hurt, though.  But just as easily...  They catch those guys?  Oh, probably not, no. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, they never caught them?  I mean, they might have a week later or that night,  but I have no...  Back then, there was no way to follow up.  Like, you need to call a police station.  No phones, no...  It feels like...  I feel like I'm talking about fucking caveman times.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm talking about when I was 20.  Right.  God, that sucks.  Yeah.  But it's a little frightening.  I've been...  I've had a pistol a long time when we were buying drugs.  Me and my friend Rodney.  I don't know how much of a friend he was.  He tried to lose me in fucking New York  when I had no money on the trains.  I would have been helpless.  And we fucking went to buy drugs in Harlem 
[00:45:00]  from New Brunswick.  We went to this Jamaican guy's  and he opened the door with a pistol and let us in.  And that was kind of weird.  Fucking 17-year-old North Brunswick kid.  I was like a young Macklemore.  I had a little black guy.  Oh, yeah.  Yo, let me tell you this quote I know.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  When they open the door  and there's a pistol sticking out,  you're like,  we're not in a good area.  We're not in a good area.  Wow.  Scary.  Yep.  I was a weakling.  Were you? 
[00:45:30]  Oh, fuck me.  Well, what are you going to do in those situations?  No, but not just for those.  Drop in bombs?  In other ones.  Oh.  Just a weakling.  Are we going to be able to travel this Thanksgiving?  What you mean, man?  Why not?  There's big, huge storms coming through.  What is it?  Oh, no.  Wind and rain.  What do we got?  Well, what?  The Midwest got a little fucked up.  When?  Yeah, I think Wednesday.  Wednesday.  We have a lot of rain coming here.  Just rain.  From Boston all the way down.  God knows how far, but pretty far down.  I land Wednesday.  Will I be okay, Kenny? 
[00:46:00]  No.  That's a long flight.  Wednesday, you're going to have to.  You're going to have delays, sir.  I probably will, right?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You've got to cross the front somewhere.  Yeah.  Maybe we can go around it, though.  It's going to be bumpy.  Over the top.  It's a big plane, though.  It's 767.  Oh, I like those.  Nice. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, nice big.  I don't mind.  You know what?  I'm on a big plane like that.  I don't mind the bumps.  I feel like it rocks me to sleep.  Yeah.  I like a good bit of turbulence.  Those planes never feel like they're going fast enough to get off the ground, though.  And then it just does.  It's so weird to me.  It is creepy.  You feel how big those fucking things are when you're in it.  It's like a living room just fucking tipping back.  It's happening.  But at least they take off, like, smoother.  Those smaller planes where everything rattles before you fucking bang.  Everything is just rattling like, you know, it can't go any fucking faster. 
[00:47:00]  The screws are shaking, and then it finally gets in the air and calms down.  Everything's shaking.  Holy fuck.  That's not good for stress.  Did I ever tell you the time we were going to South Carolina on a prop plane or North Carolina?  It wasn't real?  Yeah, it was just a fake papier-mÃ¢chÃ© plane.  There was a giant man going to throw it.  And it was so stormy.  It was a little prop.  And the guy goes, all right, I'm not going to lie to you.  Storming all the way down to North Carolina.  It ain't going to be pretty up there.  I was like, oh, my God. 
[00:47:30]  This is the last two or three years ago.  And we take off, and it's lightly bumpy, and then nothing.  It was one of the smooth...  It was literally through clouds the entire time.  He did lie.  No, but it was a fucking...  It could have been a disaster.  Those little planes, when they drop, you just hear it.  Goosh!  Goosh!  There's nothing smooth about it.  Scary.  Scary.  You just need to get on that microphone more when you're in that turbulence.  Because they know it's no big deal.  Right.  If you have no one talking to you, you're sitting there thinking all sorts of crazy shit. 
[00:48:00]  Unless you're like that other pilot that was like, we're going down!  And then the plane started diving.  I guess they had a pressure problem in the cabin.  And the mic comes on, and he says, we're going down.  And then the plane noses down and starts going into a steep dive, and the passengers were shitting themselves.  But he meant on purpose we were going down.  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, wow, we're crashing.  Food's here.  Yay!  We're going to take a break. 
[00:48:30]  We've got a great Alex Jones clip for after the break.  An amazing Alex Jones clip.  More tyranny.  Where was he in Dealey Plaza this weekend?  Yes, of course.  For the big anniversary?  For the 50th.  Boy, did I watch a lot of that Kennedy stuff on TV.  It was great.  Did you?  It was a lot of it.  It was great.  History, Smithsonian.  Because with some of those clips, they just don't pull out a lot.  Yeah, yeah.  I didn't see anything.  It was great, man.  It was pretty good.  What clips did they show?  They showed them doing tap dance.  A little tap dancing. 
[00:49:00]  That's a real one.  The Harvey Oswald tap dancing.  It was fun.  The LBJ clip talking to Jackie on the phone.  Yeah, yeah.  The whole fucking country's got your back and hanging there.  And she's sort of like flirty.  She's a little flirty with her voice.  Not on purpose, but a lot of people notice that's why she had that fucking, that it.  She had the it thing.  Grace.  She has grace.  She was Greek, I think, right?  Well, she fucking took off after that Greek guy after that. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, right.  Onassis.  Oh, yeah.  It's for Aristotle.  How long did she wait before she got remarried?  It was actually December of 63.  I love you.  I thought it was too fast.  No, I don't know.  In the 70s, I think.  She was single for a while.  She did?  Yeah, I think so.  She just couldn't get a piece.  Stay single for a while.  It really was something where they had hooked up.  Onassis and her had hooked up.  But they kind of were trying to keep it quiet and stuff.  Because America was just like, they didn't want to see her move on to someone else.  It was an odd thing.  Because that would mean Camelot is over. 
[00:50:00]  Yes.  Camelot.  Cameltoe.  Clint Hill said that JFK didn't want her around him.  Aristotle, they were going there.  I think he took Clint Hill aside and he goes, watch this guy around her.  Oh, you know, right?  Yeah.  He had an uncomfortable vibe with her and Aristotle.  So I'll bet there was some flirting.  He wanted Clint Hill to turn his back so he could fuck abroad.  That's what JFK was doing.  I think he was trying to just distract him.  He had to distract the main guy.  Clint was always around, right?  Clint Hill?  Well, that was Jackie's guy, so no. 
[00:50:30]  His guy, I want to say it was Roy Kellerman, I think, was Kennedy's.  Clint Hill would be the tattletale to Jackie.  Maybe.  So keep him distracted so you get a few things done.  You know when Jackie had to put down the fucking little, the inner tube O on her seat  before she sat down, that the Greek gentleman was trying to see how I put it in there.  Bit girthy is what you're saying?  Yes.  Bit girthy?  The Greek loves to the fucking, fucking the ass.  That was that big fucking yacht he had.  And I think JFK did not want her on that boat alone with him.  No. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, the Rockefeller Christmas tree is about ready to be decorated.  You just missed the shot.  They have the scaffolding.  That's nice.  All around it.  Great.  Whose fucking tree did they take this year?  Murdered it.  What idiot fucking said, yeah, take my beautiful tree that's been in my yard for a hundred years?  It's so wonderful.  You got to find that story for me.  It's the best.  And they always do that, yeah.  And they don't take those trees out gently.  They fucking put chains on it and rip it out of the ground. 
[00:51:30]  Huge tire fucking marks all over your lawn.  Hold on.  Okay, and then check out.  Ah, we missed it.  Taylor Swift.  Who was on a horse?  Lady Gaga rode it on the red carpet.  Lady Gaga was on a horse.  But that's a fake horse.  No, it's not.  Yeah, it looked like it.  It's a real horse.  It's like paper mache.  No.  It's head was all fucked up.  It didn't look real.  Really?  Swear.  I think that was a real horse.  It was a man walking it.  Why can't she just walk into the awards?  Because the horse is taking her.  It looked like it.  That's why I love her. 
[00:52:00]  She always makes an entrance.  It's head looked weird.  No, it's fake.  That's a fake horse.  Fake horse.  There's people inside that horse.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  That's even better.  Yay.  Yeah, she doesn't need...  She doesn't want too much attention.  Oh, God.  What happened to her growing up that she needs this much attention?  And did she get out of the car and then they had to set the horse thing up?  I know, right?  How did that happen?  She stands there like, oh, boy.  Is my fake horse ready?  She fellates it. 
[00:52:30]  That'd be great.  I really want her to sit on my face.  Yeah?  Why?  Dude, I'm telling you, she would be fun to fool around with.  Big, puffy vagina.  She's fucking hot.  I wonder.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  She'd be in there like, oh, Jim, no one's ever done it like this before.  For a mediocre man, you're good at this.  Wow.  Play with my pud.  Yeah.  Pud.  Pud.  Alex Jones next.  That's a great clip.  Yay.  And some other things.  Stay there. 
[00:53:00]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  The O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  Good old Ben Stein.  Yeah.  69 today.  He's 69.  69 years douche. 
[00:53:30]  Ah, yes.  And the Bush twins are 32.  Wow.  That happened.  And Ileon Gonzalez.  That's already 14 years ago.  How old is he now?  I make him like 20 years old, right?  How old was he?  He was what?  He was, he was, I was, he was about, he was eight at the time, right?  Somewhere around there, seven or eight?  Yeah.  21, 22.  Damn.  What's he like, a proud commie worker now?  Oh, yeah.  He's like a militant over there.  He loves Cuba.  Cuba.  We tried. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Tried to grab him up.  Show him the way.  He wouldn't bite.  Oh, my God.  Remember those photos?  Any time you're wearing those fucking shoulder epaulets, you're a bad guy.  Of course he loves Cuba.  But look what happened to him in America.  As a kid, that's beyond traumatic.  A gun in his face.  Huge gun in his face being yanked out of a house.  Where he, he thought they loved him.  He couldn't wait to get back to Cuba.  Oh, yeah.  What is he doing now? 
[00:54:30]  Where are they now, Sam?  Yeah, what is he?  Where are they now?  What is Elian Gonzalez up to?  Wow, yeah, he's, he's got the militant stripes on and everything.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, he's all in.  He's like a, uh, uh, ambassador of national pride over there.  Oh, man.  I bet you they made him that, because that was such a PR disaster, having him shift back  against his will.  He was crying, and.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, he joined the Young Communist Union of Cuba in 2008, after graduating junior high 
[00:55:00]  school.  I'm in that.  At age 15, he began military school.  Junior high school, they mean.  Oh.  Yeah.  They're taping it, they're putting it on websites, they're tweeting it.  Those individuals would know, if they want to be a part of this, take part in this activity,  they too would face these types of penalties.  So we think it'll detour it in two ways.  They'll realize there's going to be a serious penalty.  They can't use youthful offender status to get off the hook.  Secondly, if they do do this crime, they're going to spend some serious time.  They're going to be in jail for five years at a minimum, up to 25. 
[00:55:30]  We're going to get them off the streets.  Look, I have a lot of compassion for maybe the family lives of some of these kids and young  people who are doing this.  But that can't go above and beyond protecting innocent, honest, law-abiding citizens.  That's got to be our number one goal.  The rest of the societal issues, we have to deal with.  You know, we have to help these kids in some way.  Obviously, they're involved in sociopathic behavior.  We've got to try to turn the corner on that.  But first and foremost, we've got to protect, like, the 70-year-old, 88, 78-year-old lady 
[00:56:00]  who was knocked out her 12-year-old kid last week.  Listen to the guilt this guy has over a legislator against these fucking animals knocking people  out.  We can't allow that to happen.  This is a serious crime.  There's got to be serious time for it.  And I think this will be a deterrent.  Do you have hope that this will be passed?  I mean, how much support do you have?  We're excited about it.  We've got a primary sponsor in the Senate, Senator Hugh Farley.  He's been there with the most seniority in the New York State Senate.  He's a very effective legislator.  In just this past weekend, we've got a Democrat who signed up on the bill. 
[00:56:30]  That's very significant because I'm outnumbered four to one in the New York State Assembly.  We don't have the majority there.  But this crosses demographic lines.  This affects all of our constituents.  And it may affect more of them as it's escalating.  James, thanks for being...  We think we have a good chance to pass.  He's trying to get a law passed where...  Thanks for the opportunity to be with you.  Hey, thanks for being with us this morning.  I appreciate that.  All right.  He's trying to get a law passed where if you're videotaping it also, it's guilt by association.  So you can't just be standing there videotaping it, which is a tough one. 
[00:57:00]  That's a very tough one.  We're going for harsh penalties for the knockout game.  I know.  What was it?  Massachusetts was...  The town of Massachusetts was the first one to enact one of those good Samaritan laws.  If you videotape somebody as a victim of a crime, some fucking fat guy was being mugged.  And there were people just fucking laughing and videotaping it.  And then they wound up going to jail.  Why?  You can't legislate that.  Because you can't...  If you're videotaping somebody... 
[00:57:30]  But you can't help them.  It's like a good Samaritan law.  You're supposed to help them instead.  Yeah, but it depends on how dangerous the situation is.  I think if you're just on the side videotaping and documenting, it's one thing.  But they were fucking laughing at them and shit.  All right.  So don't laugh when you make your videos.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't legislate that.  That's our citizens.  That's who our citizens are.  You can't...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't be able to say that.  Why does it seem to be happening more?  Are cops figuring out what to do about it?  Why is the knockout game happening more? 
[00:58:00]  The stupid fucking...  Because you guys are doing stories on it.  Yeah, you gave it a cute name.  Yeah, a cute name.  Why is it happening more?  I was going to discuss this today.  I was down in Philly.  Wherever you go, there's stories on this.  We're talking about it.  We're guilty.  Well, yeah.  If everyone would just ignore, you know, that it's happening.  They love shit like this, though.  They love like this.  It's perfect for them.  But don't say, why is this happening more?  We all know why. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You're promoting the hell out of it by doing the stories on it.  God, why won't they ever acknowledge that in some weird way?  They won't.  They're absolutely part of the problem.  They see it as they're just reporting the news.  Yeah, it's bullshit.  Meanwhile, the way they report it, it does.  They have such an influence on, you know, future kids decide to do the knockout game.  Yeah, yeah.  And like I said, because we're discussing it, certainly.  Yeah.  I just like calling those idiots out for not acknowledging that that is part of it. 
[00:59:00]  When you call it the knockout game, it sounds like something as a kid you would like to try.  It's like, hey, you got it great.  Let me try that.  It has a nice name now.  Yeah.  It's got a cool graphic.  And then they show the best ones so far.  Yeah, maybe if I put a video.  That juices up some people to go do it.  Maybe I'll get my video on the news.  Right.  Or even like, you mean I could just go up from behind and knock someone out and then just run away and that's it?  That's hilarious.  You know, we used to just ring the doorbells and run away. 
[00:59:30]  That was pretty good.  We would ring and run.  Ringsy runsy it was called.  No, it was called ring and run.  Ringsy runsy.  Ringsy runs it.  Oh, that's good.  Why is it happening more?  They know.  How do they sleep at night?  They know.  They know.  Of course they do.  Because they publicize it.  Which Seinfeld reference did I miss?  What?  Which one did I miss?  Everyone's a bunch of rats.  Which one did I miss?  A bunch of rats. 
[01:00:00]  Which one?  I don't even know.  It was the final episode where they go to jail for videotaping the fat guy.  Getting the entire thing.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That was a good one.  That was smooth, dude.  That one was...  The listeners always rat me out.  Wow.  Fuck me.  That's a good one.  Oh, shit.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't see a lot of Seinfeld episodes, but I saw that one. 
[01:00:30]  I think everyone saw the final one, yeah.  With Panette, right?  John Panette?  Yep.  John Panette.  I never saw it.  You never saw the final episode of Seinfeld?  I might have seen one or two full episodes of Seinfeld my whole life.  Jacket Chow.  The lawyer.  That's when they brought everybody back to recreate their little catchphrases and whatnot.  Oh, did they?  Yeah, yeah.  As character witnesses in the case, they brought everybody back to kind of bash the four of  them as the horrible people that they are. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah.  Very good.  Wow.  That was a solid one.  Oh, damn.  I guess Family Guy killed Brian the dog last night, huh?  Oh, yeah.  So how are they going to spin that, and how does he come back next week as Brian the dog?  I hate when they do this shit.  That reminds me of the time.  Yeah.  One time.  That's like the time.  All right.  Remember Brian?  Let me just go back to...  What's the story about that? 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, what is the story?  They're looking for a little promotion.  I would think E-Rock would know about this.  They want morning DJs to talk about it today.  This is in his wheelhouse.  I didn't see it.  No?  No.  You two caught up in the Doctor Who thing?  That I was.  What's the Doctor Who thing?  There was so much of it.  Do you like Doctor Who?  Do you like Doctor Who?  Doctor Who stinks.  Terrible.  Doctor Who fucking stinks.  Never watched it, so don't judge it.  I've seen moments of it.  Shit.  Told you, motherfucker.  He's not wrong. 
[01:02:00]  I mean, but I've seen moments of it.  It was fucking awful.  It was shot in somebody's fucking living room.  Yes.  Terrible quality.  Terrible.  No, it's not.  It's awful.  Guy with the fucking afro.  What year did Doctor Who start?  Yeah, which Doctor Who fucking do you watch?  How do you like Doctor Who?  That was in the 70s.  Yeah, there's many different iterations.  Yeah, iterations.  Or iterations.  That too.  Okay, so you like...  Is there a new one now?  There'll be a new one on Christmas.  Oh, yeah?  They just had the 50th anniversary on Saturday.  50 years?  That shit?  Yep. 
[01:02:30]  How did that nonsense get 50 years?  I know, right?  Doctor Who.  It's a worldwide phenomenon.  Oh, it's so Euro trash shit.  Doctor Who's a fruit.  It doesn't...  Who is that?  Ian McKellen?  No.  No.  No, that's the other guy that was in Alien.  Yes.  Wow.  He's old.  I think King Ralph.  He was in King Ralph?  I think so.  He's in a lot of things.  The guy that the fucking alien bursts out of him in the first Alien. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, God, yeah.  Yeah.  Why was it Day of the Doctor over the weekend?  Ew.  That was the title of the movie for the 50th anniversary.  Day of the Doctor.  Wow, I never saw one episode of that.  It's so British.  It's terrible.  It's not.  Is there anybody from the original cast in it?  No.  Most of them were dead.  Oh, that's a conspiracy.  50 years ago, most of them dead.  They can't talk now.  What does Doctor Who do?  What kind of doctor is he?  Oncology? 
[01:03:30]  What is he?  He travels through space and time.  Ew.  Ew.  Jimmy just goes, ew.  Why would he do that?  Exactly.  Stay in one place.  Open a practice.  Doctor shit face.  Really?  Is Obamacare going to affect his gig?  Yeah.  Is Doctor Who accepting Obamacare?  If you like Doctor Who, you can keep Doctor Who.  Oh, okay.  Doctor Who.  So, they killed off Brian, and no one knows really why. 
[01:04:00]  They're just like, okay, whatever.  Floundering ratings?  It's unclear just why McFarlane and the Family Guy producers opted to kill off the character.  Hmm.  It was like a Time Machine episode.  Oh, yeah?  But the Time Machine wasn't working, but I'm sure they'll spin it somehow.  Oh, they'll get like the dog from the past and bring him back or something.  Oh, I'm sure.  I can't turn off Family Guy quick enough.  The only show I turn off quicker is Big Bang Theory. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, God, yeah.  But Family Guy, it's just like, it seems to click.  I used to love it.  Yeah?  Yeah, I used to love Family Guy.  Yeah, I used to like it, too.  Oh, yeah, but, oh.  That's like that time we went to, oh, you sure did.  It's just annoying now.  It's the same thing.  Over and over and over.  Good morning to you both.  A 12-year-old boy, a grandmother, a 24-year-old Jewish man.  Just a few of the victims recently punched in the face for no apparent reason. 
[01:05:00]  But all of these violence that's isolated are part of a larger phenomenon known as the so-called knockout.  By who?  So-called.  By who?  Because you guys are pushing it forward?  New York City police arrested this 28-year-old man Friday and charged him with assault after he randomly punched a 24-year-old Jewish man, according to authorities.  An NYPD spokesperson says its hate crimes task force is investigating that case and looking into recent similar attacks against Jews in Brooklyn, New York. 
[01:05:30]  By who?  By who?  New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly stopped short of saying they're part of a knockout game.  When you highlight an incident or a type of criminal activity, some people will simply start a copy.  Yeah, thank you.  It's a phenomenon of that we've seen before.  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Is that a game?  What the f***?  And the media's showing people on their video call.  Wait, there was like real people that wasn't like CGI or something?  No.  Yes, it's CGI.  The only show video too could hardly believe that this is happening. 
[01:06:00]  A colored guy incident.  Oh!  These videos captured by surveillance cameras could just be random attacks or they could be what is considered the knockout game or the one hit or quitter where youths randomly punch strangers with the goal of knocking them unconscious with a single blow.  Guys, 28 years old who got arrested?  It's not a game because, I mean, a person probably was really injured.  The idea that you could just attack someone for no reason on the streets of New York City is something that's outrageous.  One of the latest victims, a 78-year-old grandmother.  Her daughter says she was walking home earlier this month when a young man ran up and punched her. 
[01:06:30]  She's terrified.  She now will not leave the front of her building.  The violent stunts have been reported in at least six states and Washington, D.C.  At least four victims have died, including this Vietnamese man in St. Louis and a homeless man in Hoboken, New Jersey.  They're doing this to get a thrill, to prove their manhood or womanhood, part of peer pressure, and certainly they are followers and not leaders. 
[01:07:00]  And it's difficult for police to know exactly how widespread these cases are because up until now they'd all fall under assault.  Some police departments I spoke with are reluctant to tie any of these recent random assault cases to the knockout game.  After all, random attacks on strangers is nothing new, and it's unclear whether they're tied to the knockout game unless a suspect confesses to it.  But, you know, one thing is clear here, that these suspects in these cases face very severe consequences. 
[01:07:30]  In fact, in the case with the St. Louis man who was killed, as was mentioned in my piece, the suspect in that case was sentenced to life in prison.  So these kids need to know that this is anything but a game.  The guy was 28 who was arrested in New York.  Let's talk more about this.  He's not a kid.  But they have to say teen or youth.  What's your take on this?  Is this a growing trend?  Is this an urban myth or maybe better stated as growing trend or a group of isolated incidents? 
[01:08:00]  Well, you know, because we all know about what's going on, I mean, the whole country knows about the knockout game pretty much.  All right, so this is definitely a trend.  You know, this is no urban myths.  Urban myths really don't exist.  These attacks exist in everyone's minds, especially those of the victims.  Is there a concern that by us focusing on it is going to give it more life and more legs?  I mean, I think the goal is from law enforcement to the public to just shut this kind of thing down immediately.  Well, awareness is a good thing.  I think that we have to let the public know what's going on to protect themselves. 
[01:08:30]  I mean, that's our job.  You know, that's what the police department's job is to protect the public.  How can the public protect themselves when you're leaving out a huge part of the story?  It's our job to make sure that people are aware of what's going on out there in the street and how to protect themselves.  Now, I get why they don't, why the cops don't want to attach it to this title, because they don't want to glorify the activity.  What you're talking about with PC is an important point to make.  What are we not hearing here that the police need to focus on in stopping these incidents?  Well, I'll tell you, stopping the incidents are going to be very hard to do. 
[01:09:00]  There's no way we can find out an incident that's going to occur tomorrow or the day after.  Because there's a random attack on the street with groups of black youths.  Ah, thank you.  I'm asking people, you know, who I run into every day, what are you doing to protect yourself on the street?  And they're basically saying that if they see a group of black youths, they cross the street.  See, now, okay, that's going to be a problem right there.  Why?  That's going to be a problem because, you know, nieces and nephews and kids and black kids around that don't need to be feel, made to feel that they're a threat simply because they're hanging out with their friends. 
[01:09:30]  And so there's a concern.  You can see how that concern is going to grow.  There's a fucking fact that every black kid is doing this.  Of course.  It's very feel, all right, but if you're the victim, all right, if you're a potential victim and you're afraid walking down the street and you see a group of black youths, everybody I am talking to says they're crossing the street.  They are getting away from them, all right, and that's what's happening.  And that's the thing that concerns me.  And it's something that concerns me, yeah, because the good black kids are going to say, you know, why are you crossing the street when I come walking by? 
[01:10:00]  The vast majority of kids aren't doing this.  Why do you have to take that?  Black kids are getting clopped, too.  She's part, she's part, she's part, she's part, she's part, she's part.  That's what's happening also.  This guy will never be on CNN again, by the way.  It's not new, okay?  There was an incident that happened like this in New York City where they actually targeted a kid who was mentally challenged.  And he was just standing there and this guy stood up and he was as renowned prowess for fighting.  And he knocked the kid out with one tongue.  And the videotape hit.  But here's what happened.  It sparked such outrage, which goes to Harry's point about notifying the public, that they found the guy. 
[01:10:30]  He changed the race thing real quick.  And he got to be arrested.  Is that what's different here?  Is that they continue to happen and the people who are behind it aren't getting caught.  I mean, there are definitely some folks who have been charged.  It's black kids doing it in the fucking fat one.  It's the threshold.  Where do you, where, what do you do to kind of stem this time?  You can't, well, hopefully that this trend will just wear out like everything else does.  And then they'll just sign up.  He couldn't help himself with that.  What's going on?  There's extra police patrols down there on the street.  What's going on on the street? 
[01:11:00]  You rarely get a real moment like this.  This guy will never be on CNN.  He's great.  He's got to be charged.  He's got to be charged.  That's amazing.  A lot of people are uncomfortable with that.  He made the fat one uncomfortable.  Well, it's like, why do you have to take that angle?  This is who's committing the crime.  Stop saying there's good kids, too.  We know that.  If nothing was happening, and he got on and said, well, when you see a group of young black people steer clear,  then she could come out and say, hey, what are you talking about?  There's no reason to do that.  But when you're coming out and saying that this whole thing, you're doing a story on it, for the love of God. 
[01:11:30]  You're doing a story on it because it's happened enough times.  And it's always a group of young black men doing it, and women, and girls.  I don't want people to walk around suddenly in fear.  We have to be aware of ourselves.  But we also don't want to start looking askance at every group of kids that walk by.  That's true, especially when the guy who just got hit for the religious, you know, attacking the religious guy, the Jewish guy.  He's not a black guy.  No.  You know, so it's going to spread in terms of which kids do it because nobody's immune to stupid.  I think that way you don't want to be nervous. 
[01:12:00]  Wow.  You also want to increase the groveling fear, to be honest.  The way that you will anticipate is that as it's forming and happening, everybody's got one of these now, right?  Listen to the way they talk around it.  If you want to take video of what they're doing, you take video.  You know, if you're at a safe distance and you see it, videotape it.  You don't want to get involved.  You can't even tell the truth.  You want people out there to take video of what they're doing.  People will stop it.  This is creating terror, you know, on the streets.  You know, people are, you know, as soon as they see black youths, and like I said, everybody knows.  Yeah.  You know, but you can understand why they don't think that way. 
[01:12:30]  No, you also can understand why it concerns me, Harry, right?  No, it concerns me also.  It really does.  It concerns me also.  Because, you know, you're pointing the finger at some kids who would never even think about doing something like this.  They can't handle honest TV.  But you as a person walking down the street, you're saying, I don't want to be the next guy to get cropped in the face.  Why should I?  You've got people who are dead.  You've got people who are seriously injured.  And let me just quickly jump in here.  First of all, this isn't like an organized crime.  I mean, any kid can jump in and do this, right? 
[01:13:00]  So there's, I don't think, I don't think there's any bounds as far as that goes.  I mean, it's, but also we've talked about how these random attacks on strangers have been happening for years.  Keep trying to move away.  Is it just, is it that now it has a label?  But the detective keeps bringing it right back.  You know, the blacks!  The internet makes these things more interesting because they can communicate these things.  That's why another component of it is getting the ISPs and having them to take these videos down right away,  source the videos right away.  That part is not being done yet.  The police are just trying to do that and it'll help.  Wow.  It'll help.  Thank you very much.  Robbling cowards.  Appreciate the perspective. 
[01:13:30]  And now the fat one will talk again.  Lots of concerns on this.  You don't have to be black to be worried about the perception of blacks.  But, you know, we have to do everything we can to stop it.  Coming up on New Day, wait until you hear about this.  The people are being killed.  People are being killed by being punched in the face.  And all the fucking the CNN anchors can worry about is that  somebody may misinterpret them telling the truth as being racist.  That is the country we live in.  And if you're walking down the street and you see a group of young black men, 
[01:14:00]  a group walking down the street towards you,  would you want to take that chance?  What's the upside to not crossing the street?  What's the upside there that this other woman here wants you to?  She wants you to not cross the street, apparently.  She doesn't want you because they might be good.  And they probably would be completely harmless, good kids, no problem.  But what's the upside?  You see, what she was saying, and this is what's so wrong with it, 
[01:14:30]  is saying, like, well, that's what concerns me.  No, what's concerning should be the fact that people are being killed  with knuckles in their face, you big fat fucking devil's advocate dummy.  Not the fact that you might appear impolite by saying something that's truthful.  How about this?  What's sickening is the fact that these guys are doing this,  and they're causing completely innocent people to be looked at.  Yes.  Why does that concern you?  She's almost putting the onus on the people making the decision across the street  instead of the onus on the animals that are committing the crimes. 
[01:15:00]  So the victims and the potential victims are the problem here.  Holy shit.  But the detective didn't back down.  Oh, no, he is great.  I feel bad for him because those type of guys don't work on news shows.  Oh, he'll be on Fox.  They'll move him over to Fox?  They'll fucking roll out the red carpet over on Fox for him.  Amazing.  Ah, that's amazing.  It really is.  And he has way more knowledge than that fat fucking lady does.  Yep, yep. 
[01:15:30]  As far as what's going on on the streets.  That was fun to watch.  If we want to know about buffets, then we'll talk to her.  If we want to know what's going on on the streets of New York City,  we'll talk to the detective.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was watching them scurry.  That was a good find.  They get all fucking like, oh!  They were petrified.  Mm-hmm.  That was embarrassing.  Yeah, yeah.  The lack of honesty in them.  Just the lack of honest, simple, like, hey, this is what's happening. 
[01:16:00]  Mm-hmm.  You can say it respectfully.  You don't have to be a racist about it.  But the reality is that's what's happening.  They keep saying hate crime, hate crime, hate crime, and mentioning the victim, the victim,  the victim.  They're not mentioning the perpetrators.  No.  It's all the detective does.  CNN themselves didn't say anything about the perpetrators.  No.  They will not mention it.  They are.  The phoniness.  I literally feel like I'm in a movie.  Yeah.  I feel like we're in a movie and this is not real.  Of course it's real, yeah. 
[01:16:30]  But doesn't it feel like they couldn't?  Well, you are in Fantasyland.  They couldn't be this fake.  Huh?  They couldn't be this fake.  Like, it's almost like it's...  I can't comprehend why people would be so dishonest.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow.  The lady telling people not to walk across the street.  If it was her, she would.  Of course she would.  We all would.  We all profile.  Yes.  Every single person.  It doesn't matter what fucking color you are, you profile.  Period.  It's part of a survival instinct.  It's part of being a human being.  You assess a situation around you, your surroundings, 
[01:17:00]  and you act accordingly to the best of your ability to preserve yourself.  That's what that is.  And to go against that, those hunches, those feelings and stuff,  isn't a good thing.  Especially for what?  To be politically correct?  No.  There's too many people I've heard on interviews and crime documentaries,  and when you talk to them and they say,  I should have trusted that voice in my head told me I shouldn't have done this, 
[01:17:30]  or I should have done that, or, you know, I've had a feeling and I ignored it.  That fat bitch, right?  Yeah.  Let's say they were giving out free sherbet at the free sherbet store.  Oh, yeah.  And you saw that she was marching toward the free sherbet store.  Wouldn't you be running a little faster and get in front of her?  Because odds are.  That's called profile.  Odds are it's not going to be there when...  How do these marching bands do this shit?  How the fuck they do this? 
[01:18:00]  Oh, they make the little shapes.  This band lit a huge cannon.  That's nothing about what they do in Korea, because I guess North Korea.  Korea, they really know how to do that shit?  Oh, my God.  A hundred thousand will do it.  There's a hundred thousand in the stadium.  It's amazing.  I don't know how they do that shit.  Yeah, it's like each person is a pixel, and they just keep changing.  They just got to know what to do.  It looks like a fucking television on this field.  All timed out.  Cool.  Amazing.  Pretty amazing.  Do you want commentary on when crimes are covered by the media? 
[01:18:30]  Huh?  Oh, Steve, the therapist.  What?  Fucking intention-seeking idiot.  Hey, Steve.  What's up, buddy?  Hi.  Yes.  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are you?  Hello.  Good, Steve.  Speaking to Anthony's point, there's a book called The Gift of Fear by Gavin Decker.  Yes.  I've read it.  It's excellent.  Have you really read that one?  I gave it to somebody that, yeah, we know.  So, I gave that.  And it speaks exactly to the point that you have natural instincts that know when bad things 
[01:19:00]  are going to happen before the brain recognizes it.  Yes.  The book also, the author Gavin also goes to speak to the fact, way before Sandy Hook, that  we are building the next monster by the way the media, you know, exploits what they do.  Yeah, we've talked about that in the past, too, yeah.  Where the media pumps up these fucking lone gunman psychos and gives them a platform and 
[01:19:30]  fame, even after they're dead.  The next person sees this and says, hey, this is great.  I could finally be a somebody.  I have no doubt that us talking about it, because we do have to add ourselves to this  one, and CNN talking about the knockout game.  We just turned on a few people to the knockout game, and they're going to try it.  Well, you know what it is?  Period.  I disagree, and I'll tell you why.  There's a difference between...  You disagree with that?  Why?  There's a difference between sensationalizing it and reporting it. 
[01:20:00]  You guys do a pretty good job of not sensationalizing it.  So if you do nothing, sensational.  Yeah, but even us talking about it, isn't that kind of sensationalizing it in some...  I think we talk about it in a way that's not the way they want to be spoken about.  In some loner's mind.  Like, we don't make the loners look like heroes.  We call them little groveling pieces of shit.  That's true.  We don't give them what they want, which is hero status.  We call them animals.  Yeah.  They should be shot.  There's a difference between, I think, bashing them and talking about them harshly and propping them up like they're these weird anti-heroes. 
[01:20:30]  Reading their manifesto.  Yeah.  So if you don't...  Hold on.  So if you don't sensationalize, then you're not turning kids onto the knockout game in this case.  Well, I don't think the kids need to turn on O&A to learn about the knockout game.  You know what I'm saying?  The rest of the media is doing a very good idea of sensationalizing it.  Every news channel has a story on it now.  Every fucking channel.  And they wonder why it's ramping up. 
[01:21:00]  Well, because people are...  Hold on a minute, man.  Mark Goodman is ready to push the fucking button, man.  Oh, nice.  Wow, they bought a lot of time on Fox, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Free listening through December 3rd doesn't include the O.P. and Anthony channel.  By the way, I tried to listen on my fucking...  It doesn't include us.  Why?  I don't know.  Shouldn't we be on the free thing?  It would be nice.  It would be.  Anyway, go ahead, Steve.  Here's a good litmus test for sensationalizing.  Look at the way Jimmy talks about a pair of tits versus the way you guys talk about the 
[01:21:30]  knockout game.  That's true.  Nobody says they'd like a dick to be hanging under the knockout game.  There's not a lot of guys getting in their cars cruising trannies because of the way you  guys talk about it.  And Jimmy loves punching tits.  Who doesn't, right?  All right.  I'm punching out, guys.  Thanks, man.  I think he's right.  I think this guy's right.  As long as you don't sensationalize it.  Or if you talk about, like...  That's interesting to me.  When you read, like you said, read the manifestos.  When they call this, like, you know, James, whatever his name was, the joke.  James Hollywood Joker. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We don't do that.  We, I think, pretty much call them scumbags and little broken people.  And nobody wants that.  It's like nobody wants to be made fun of and mocked.  I think if you're honest...  Yeah, that part of the story is really, it really is missing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Big five.  You're so right.  Yeah, if you're honest about it in the reporting, then, you know, I think it does a lot.  Yeah, they give him all cute little names.  Yeah.  Comic book names.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice graphics, music.  Uh-huh.  Why did he do it?  Like, I don't care. 
[01:22:30]  He's a crazy fuck.  Yeah.  We all know why he did it.  He's nuts.  He's a damaged human being.  I've gotten into so many arguments over the weekend about the whys, you know.  Why do they do it?  We need a solution to this.  It's like, you know what?  You know what?  Well, no.  With the knockout game and stuff.  People are just trying with the whys and how...  If you have a leak in your roof, you don't sit there for days as it's raining wondering  how the hole got there.  What happened?  You fucking fix the thing and then deal with it. 
[01:23:00]  And try to prevent it from happening again.  But this whole, well, you know, you're not offering up a solution.  You're not helping by what you're saying.  It's like, I'm just saying protect yourself.  And like that detective said, you know, there's an element of profiling there that has to go  on in order to protect yourself from this.  There isn't anybody that can give you a protection little seminar for the knockout game, honestly, 
[01:23:30]  without bringing up the racial aspect of it.  You can't say, well, to protect yourself, look at everybody, because they might punch  you in the head.  No.  You whittle it down to who the group of people were that's been doing it.  And you try to, you know, keep your head on a swivel when you see that happening.  And what they do is, this is why I have such a loathing for them, because they always throw  in, hey, look, this could be anybody.  It's like, you don't have to say that.  But in a case like Zimmerman, Trayvon Martin, they don't throw in the other, yeah, but also 
[01:24:00]  black youths are doing it too.  Like, it's just, it's such a fucking weird, I don't know why they're afraid to tell the  truth.  What do they think they're doing?  It's like, can't you see the difference between being honest about a crime and what  America did in the 50s and 60s?  Can't you see the difference between just telling the truth and actually being racist?  It's not a blanket excuse, either.  You can't use America's history as a blanket excuse for the inability to know right from 
[01:24:30]  wrong, the penchant for violence.  You just can't throw the old, well, this happened, so, you know, that's going to happen.  No, I'm not accepting that.  Sorry.  That was a great example.  I think we all know that by now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not accepting it.  Exactly.  Oh my God.  And by that, and by that, and then he sprinkles in a cute fucking kitten picture.  That's what you got to do.  You're a weirdo.  Keeps him going.  You're really weird on Twitter. 
[01:25:00]  Ridiculous on the top, what some would say hate, and then a cute kitten picture.  And by not accepting it, Anthony means the Emancipation Proclamation.  Right.  I won't accept it.  No, it's so fucking weird, though, because people do say hate, and it's a discussion, an honest  discussion I have online about race.  And, of course, I'm called a racist for it, because I'm just being honest.  I'm not preaching hate.  I'm not preaching violence against any people.  I'm not preaching keeping anyone down. 
[01:25:30]  You know, I've said in the past, America's a great place with a lot of opportunity.  If you apply yourself, educate yourself, find your talents, whatever, whatever, there's  a great opportunity here.  I'm not saying everyone shouldn't be entitled to that opportunity.  But when I get honest and talk about things that are really happening in this country,  people then turn around and say, racist?  You're really demeaning the word racist by including me in that.  You're taking people that actually did kill other people because of their race, kept them 
[01:26:00]  out of jobs, kept them out of schools, those are racist.  Yes, hat purchases.  That's a racist.  By calling me a racist, you're really softening the word down, don't you think?  Jesus.  I have an open and honest discussion.  And then I post kittens.  Adorable kitty pictures.  God, that fat pig was great this morning.  She's everything we've said.  Oh, well, I thought when he played the music, she got so annoyed.  Oh, I fucking hate her. 
[01:26:30]  I'm kidding, you rock, I love you.  She got so annoyed.  Yeah.  Just had to do it.  She fucking had to do it.  Had to be the whole.  There's a great documentary called Outfoxed, where they go into all these news programs  and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  And a guy like that will not be back on CNN because he didn't play his part properly.  Nope.  He got her mad.  Right.  You know the damage he did by saying that?  He won't be back.  They'll find somebody else that's a little, you know, more, quote, honest for their world. 
[01:27:00]  But then to make the detective almost feel defensive, like going, well, you know you can't, and then  you've got to go, yeah, well, I'm concerned about it, too.  That's irrelevant.  We're not talking about that.  He's just telling the truth about who's doing it.  Yeah.  And they felt a need.  We could not have talked about a better example than that, of the subtlety of that.  Right.  Yes.  Because none of them discussed it.  None of them said, don't say that.  But how do you, in a court of law, describe the tone?  If we had to go to court, we'd lose.  And then Cuomo backed her up by finding the one time where it wasn't, you know, a black 
[01:27:30]  guy.  Oh, yeah.  Did he?  We said the Jewish guy was targeted.  Did he say that the perpetrator was white?  I don't remember.  Yeah.  He found one incident where it might not have been a black guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wasn't a black guy.  So they've been showing that one a lot.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's, you know, that's the way they operate.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  It's not a black, white thing.  Oh, good.  Let's just.  Oh, no.  Sure.  No, not today.  It's Monday.  All right.  Please.  No.  God, no.  It'll be nice.  Larry in Jersey.  What's up? 
[01:28:00]  Yo.  Yeah, guys.  I mean, I know it's black guys doing it right now, but if I'm in the city and I'm  with my chick or alone, and it could be any group of guys, white, Chinese, even Hasidic  Jews, this group of guys, my fucking radar's up, man.  Like, you're just not going to walk past a group of guys.  A group of Hasidic Jews?  Really?  Really?  Yeah.  They might fight, you know, especially in Brooklyn, bro, you're in their territory.  A group of Asians maybe with cameras taking pictures of, you know, you got to look at  the context of where, what a group is doing.  Yeah.  You know, if it looks like the Warriors and they're fucking swinging baseball bats and shit 
[01:28:30]  like that, I can understand.  But if it's a group of black guys, let's say, dressed in, like, school uniforms, let's  say, walking around, talking to each other about the day's studies, would you cross the  street?  No.  All right.  If it's a bunch of white guys and they're brandishing, you know, something that could  be perceived as a weapon, talking about someone's ass that they just kicked around a corner, 
[01:29:00]  would you cross the street?  Yeah.  Yes.  It's all about the context.  I'm with them with the Hasidic Jews, by the way.  Are they dangerous?  Yeah.  They could penny pinch you to death, man.  Oh, man.  Wow.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  They use those, uh, yarmulkes like odd job, use this hat.  Right.  Yes.  Very dangerous.  Did you ever walk in Brooklyn in their territory?  You saw the videos, man.  They'll fuck with you.  Understandable, but when we're talking about this, you know what we're talking about. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  You see who's been committing the crimes.  No one is saying other groups can't commit the crimes.  But as of right now, this is just what's happening.  Yeah.  So instead of feeling so guilty about just saying what it is that's happening, why not  just stop looking for what other groups could do.  We know that.  Yeah.  Don't look for a way to exempt people from this, the people that are doing this.  I think you're just missing my point.  My point is that, like you said, Anne, like in context, like if you're walking down the 
[01:30:00]  street and you see a bunch of black guys in school gear, you know, from Catholic school,  you're not going to feel as threatened as, say, a group of white kids that are all fucking  dressed, kind of ghetto, all fucked up, I need down.  Just black adults and like coming out of work, I wouldn't feel threatened by a bunch.  If I saw five black construction workers standing there talking, I would feel zero threat from  those guys.  Zero.  But that black lady is making people feel guilty because they might be profiling their  own heads for their own safety.  Yeah.  Whatever their profiling is based on, by the way. 
[01:30:30]  And now if you're trying to make you feel guilty to have those dirty, dirty thoughts in  your head.  Exactly.  And the story that is twisted.  They're talking about the story of young black kids, people, punching people in the face.  So if you're addressing that story and then the detective says it's young black people  doing this.  Majority, whatever.  Majority.  Yeah.  Overwhelmingly, it's black guys right now.  Then when he says people are going to avoid groups of black people walking down the street, 
[01:31:00]  you can't then call them out on that.  Well, that's where I have a problem.  What's the problem?  Because you're black.  I see.  So the damaging part, instead of people, four people have been killed by this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And instead of saying, wow, these guys are such animals doing this and causing this  uncomfortability around other black people who are doing nothing.  Yeah.  You blame the people walking, looking out for themselves.  I have never seen a group of people that are so coddled and that people have such a, just 
[01:31:30]  this, you have to make an excuse or some type of cover or, or, or change the subject.  Like, it's just such a taboo thing to talk about.  Yeah.  Amazing.  That's the press.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's say, thank you, sir.  Let's go to Clayton, uh, in Ohio there.  Clayton.  Morning, fellas.  How you doing?  Hey, buddy.  Hello.  Hey, Anthony, I totally agree with your self-preservation thought. 
[01:32:00]  Yeah.  The other thing I was thinking was the, and I'm not calling anyone, any race animals.  What I am saying is if I'm walking down the street and there's a giant Rottweiler, it  could be the nicest dog in the world.  There's still a good chance I'm going to cross the street.  Same thing with a pit bull or, or, or, or, you know, something that has a history of,  of, of predict, you know, predictable behavior.  They're, yeah, I'm absolutely going to try to preserve my own health and safety.  And, and I don't think it goes any further than that is you have to look at facts or 
[01:32:30]  you have to look at the past performance to indicate future performance.  You can't, you can't make people feel guilty because they profile whatsoever.  Yeah.  It is part of human nature.  We all know that.  Right.  Sorry.  I wonder what Macklemore would say.  There's Macklemore.  Yo, you can't judge anyone.  Yo, no groups of people.  He would, he would grovel and not say anything.  Macklemore looks like spaz.  You know what?  I'm trying to figure out who he looks like.  Yeah, that's it. 
[01:33:00]  Yes.  I want to say hi to Trayvon.  Wants to weigh in on the topic.  Joe in Nebraska.  Oh.  What do you have to worry about in Nebraska?  Right.  Nebraska?  Oh.  Yeah.  That Omaha's mean place.  What are you getting, coin thrown at you or something?  You know what?  I'm going to be honest with you.  Isn't Nebraska filled with a lot of, what?  It's big cities.  It's liberal.  It's liberalism.  It disgusts me, dude.  All right.  When fuckers walk up and they want to knock people out, I don't care if they're black,  white, or fucking spick.  I will put some fucking bars between their fucking eyes. 
[01:33:30]  Look at that.  This guy will take a...  God's on his fucking truth.  I'll tell you what.  Bring it on, motherfuckers.  Bring it on.  That's kind of...  I have that bumper sticker.  Bring it on, motherfucker.  Bring it on.  A ball between the eyes.  There you go.  I don't see much wrong with that.  So what is your point, though?  If I'm going to do a situation by myself or with my old lady, if I fucking see guys that  don't care, black, white, spick, Asian...  You made that point already.  We get it.  I got my fucking eyes on it.  We get it, Charlie Bronson.  We got it.  They...  They...  Boy, I tell you, they will rue the day they crossed your path. 
[01:34:00]  We got it.  Bronson.  Well, Macklemore's going to be very upset with you, Joe.  You motherfucker.  What's that?  I didn't hear what you said.  Fuck you.  Victim.  That's what you are.  You fucking whine and cry.  Well, fuck you.  Try and fucking play the other end, you dumb motherfucker.  Fuck you two and your phony phone call.  Hey, if that guy came to me, you bet I'd shoot him dead.  Me and my gal.  Don't you mess...  Fuck you and your Midwestern speculative nonsense. 
[01:34:30]  Oh, get killed in a boating accident.  Oh, I forgot there's no water there.  Yeah, right between the eyes, bucko.  You tangle with me and my gal on the way to the sock hop, and I'll give you the business.  Shut up.  Talk about what you've done, not what you're going to do in a speculative situation.  If I were in space, I'd float.  Yeah, wouldn't we all, dickhead?  You don't know.  Of course he did.  Thanks for the phone call, Joe. 
[01:35:00]  Stupid asshole.  That's the type of conversation I had when I was 16 and drunk.  Exactly.  Fuckin' it, come for me and my girl.  Here's what I do.  Yeah.  Let's just go do it.  What'd you...  Shut up.  Let's say hi to Brian in Texas.  Brian.  Hi, Brian.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  What I want to know is, where are the black leaders that are sitting there saying, hey,  you know, we're noticing this going on, let's take hold of the reins, let's get it taken.  Because they, obviously you're talking about like an Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson.  Sharpton did comment on this. 
[01:35:30]  He did?  Yeah.  When?  Over the weekend.  Oh, fuck you.  Oh, great.  He had to.  Yeah, yeah, he had to at this point.  Wow.  That's a step in the right direction, right?  Yeah.  I'm surprised he would have, you know, spoke about this.  It doesn't mean anything, though.  He has to.  It's self-serving.  Yeah, he had to.  What did he say?  He said more white people should get punched.  Yeah, he goes, you know, you need to hit harder and uppercut.  I see.  Hey, oh, well.  Just don't videotape it, stupid.  Yeah.  Oh, is that true? 
[01:36:00]  Sharpton said, only knock out the Greek homos.  Oh, okay.  Thank you for that.  Yeah.  Wasn't he part of the knockout game on Morton Downey Jr. Show?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Morton Downey.  That fuck went down easy.  Oh, he did.  He looked up.  He was mad.  Oh, boy, was he.  He looked silly.  Is there any audio from Reverend Al?  I don't have the audio.  He said, we would not be silent if it was the other way around. 
[01:36:30]  We cannot be silent or in any way reluctant to confront it when it's coming from our own community.  Oh, that's very good.  Well, why doesn't Al Sharpton tell that fat bitch from CNN that?  Yeah.  Would she accept it if Al Sharpton said it to her?  Maybe.  He said, this kind of insane thuggery, there is nothing cute about that.  There is no gameplay about knocking somebody out.  And it is not a game.  It is an assault, and it is bias, and it is wrong.  Damn.  Wow, Reverend Al.  Reverend Al, nice. 
[01:37:00]  He is outraged.  He's outraged.  He's got to be outraged.  Damn.  It's good for business.  All right, well, you know what?  At least he said something.  Yeah.  And it was in the right direction.  Again, at least, yeah, white people won't say it.  No, no, no.  White people won't say it.  But the absence of them speaking about one of the most important parts of the story,  it's unbelievable.  Yeah.  It's so obvious, too, that they're not talking about it. 
[01:37:30]  And we're not making it up.  It gets fun.  It's nice to see, like, something confirmed, even though I guess maybe I don't want to  overbeat the same point.  I mean, yeah, yeah.  All right, we're going to break, and we're going to talk about Alex Jones next.  Yeah, Alex Jones.  Got a really good clip from Alex Jones.  Oh, yeah.  And don't forget about our podcast, doing very, very well.  The Mike Tyson episode, doing extremely well.  We have a new Opie and Anthony podcast that comes out every Wednesday.  I don't know what we're doing this week.  Uh-oh. 
[01:38:00]  We've still got to figure out this week's podcast, boys.  Today's considered Wednesday.  See, that's weird right there.  Yeah, we've got to figure one out.  Maybe a Thanksgiving.  What did we do for Thanksgiving over the years?  For Thanksgiving.  Special.  The hard rock special.  Is it good for a podcast?  It was a good broadcast, definitely.  Could be.  It was very funny.  All right, we'll figure it out.  We don't have to figure it out live in the air, I guess.  I have a special thing to figure out, though.  What?  Oh, what?  I booked an L.A. gig for December 12th, the improv, one night. 
[01:38:30]  So if you were in L.A. and people always complain I'm not in L.A., well, Thursday, the  12th, I'm doing an 8 o'clock show.  It's in Melrose.  Ooh.  And it's going to be fucking good.  Nice.  So we...  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius X.  Sirius XM.  You guys are back for the toilet.  Now, back to our show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:39:00]  It's Monday.  Yeah, apparently.  How many people are working?  Big workforce out there today?  I don't think so, right?  I'm not sure.  I don't know.  I don't know many people that work the business end of this are actually off, but...  Really?  I think some on-air people might have taken the week.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or taken, you know, the whole fucking...  I think you take from now until New Year's.  Yeah.  It's like...  Most of upstairs is gone until January 1st, more or less. 
[01:39:30]  Oh, they are?  Yeah, they don't...  They just check in so often.  Yeah.  Wait, are we on...  For the winter storm, that's...  When's it hitting?  Wednesday?  But it's rain.  It's hitting right now somewhere else, though.  As far as our area of the country.  Wednesday?  Yeah.  Is that a good clip?  That's the clip.  No, yeah.  Let's listen to this.  Bryant Gumbel.  We talked about this last week.  I think he's a little mad at Charles Barkley, because of how Charles Barkley was talking about 
[01:40:00]  the N-word.  Yeah.  And I thought what Charles Barkley had to say was pretty intelligent.  Do we have that clip?  Because it matters to play that clip before the Bryant Gumbel clip.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  He's just pointing.  Oh, boy.  Why would E-Rock just point at you?  Maybe he's queuing him for something, no?  Oh, man.  Looking for that clip.  Oh, there they are.  I have to go through our crack archive system. 
[01:40:30]  Which is a stack of CDs.  A lot of CDs.  The compact disc.  Croy, you don't see those very often.  Yeah, I don't use them much for photos or whatever, but I might have to go with a MacBook Air.  But I still watch DVDs occasionally, but they have a portable one that you can kind of plug into it, don't they?  Yeah, yeah.  There's plenty of those.  Yeah.  I like the little MacBook Air, but I'd rather use the MacBook.  But I'm saying, is the MacBook Air of enough memory? 
[01:41:00]  I'm going to get a new computer, I think.  Well, it's probably not worth getting.  If you have an iPad, it's like a MacBook Air.  I would just get the MacBook Pro.  Okay.  And, you know, get top-of-the-line one, and you're set for a little while.  That's what I got.  It's great, right?  How old is yours?  You have a new one?  New.  Mine's old with a broken screen.  Oh, boy.  Mine's three years old.  I just picked one up.  They're great.  I got a cracked screen on mine.  Yeah?  Yeah.  How'd that happen?  Outer Banks, a couple years ago.  Uh-oh.  I still haven't fixed it. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, shit.  We should know it.  Did the technology change?  At this point, yeah.  You found it?  All right.  Here's Charles Barkley on the N-word.  And then, because of this, Brian Gumbel did his thing on the N-word.  So, let's start with Charles Barkley.  You might have heard this.  But I'm done standing up for the-  Can I get louder?  Can you turn up your volume?  You better let us say that.  Well, it's one more louder.  And that's Matt Barnes' tweet.  Okay.  And then, uh, overnight, uh, he-he thought about it.  And then he-he unleashed it.  It's too late now.  Like a string of-  Like Herm ever said, don't push sand.  Yeah, like six-like six tweets, uh, uh, uh, when he was, uh, saying- 
[01:42:00]  I'm sorry.  I'd like to take a second to apologize.  That was the part we need.  As you see him there, for my actions.  And then, uh, another one.  Barnes, there's no apology needed.  Needed.  I'm a black man.  Damn it.  No way.  I use the N-word.  I'm going to continue to use the N-word with my black friends.  With my white friends.  They are my friends.  This debate that's going on with the Miami Dolphin thing about bullying and racial slurs. 
[01:42:30]  Hey, Ernie, in a locker room, and when I'm with my friends, we use racial slurs.  So this was appropriate to tweet this out?  No.  No.  Okay, that's not-  The one white guy playing devil's advocate.  Hey, hey, now.  We should not have made it public.  But this debate, it goes back to the Paula Deen thing, where they're like, where all black  people use it among themselves.  It's in rap records.  Listen, what I do with my black friends is not up to white America to dictate to me- 
[01:43:00]  Unless it's punching them in the face.  It's very inappropriate.  Matt Barnes should not have said that publicly.  You are 100% correct.  But-  I don't think anybody right now is telling you, Charles, what you can do with your friends.  I've been watching TV for the last few months, going back to Paula Deen, going to the incognito  Martin thing.  White people, white reporters.  Number one, first of all, they don't have the courage to go in the locker room.  That's why they're reporters.  What we say in the locker room, and it should always stay in the locker room, I might add 
[01:43:30]  that also.  But the language we use, first, sometimes it's homophobic.  Sometimes it's sexist.  And a lot of times it's racist.  We do that when we're joking with our teammates.  And it's none personal.  But this national debate that's going on right now, it makes me uncomfortable that regular  people try to act like they have the courage to play pro sports.  They don't have that.  And Mike Wilbon did a great job on television today. 
[01:44:00]  I love his show, him and Tony Kornhouser.  I saw it too.  White America don't get to dictate how me and Shaq talk to each other.  And they have been trying to infiltrate themselves.  Shaq Balloon rules.  And you just drop the N-bomb to the Shaq Balloon?  No, no, no.  That's not the same.  As I tell my white friends, who I love like brothers, whether it's Joe Klein, Mike Jeminski,  Dan Marley, they've asked me, well, when is it appropriate?  I said, well, if you use it around the wrong, brother, the next thing you're going to hear  is the clock's out your damn head. 
[01:44:30]  Go, Shaq.  That's when it's inappropriate, Ernie.  You know what?  The N-word.  And it was inappropriate.  In this, in this segment.  When he took it publicly.  Exactly.  See, this is the childish, we just fucking.  Can you, I know, it's just.  A bunch of children.  Just stupid language.  Oh, it's just.  We really are.  We think we're advanced.  We're the same dickheads we were in 1950.  What did, what did Shaq say?  What did Shaq say?  I'm here with Shaq say.  I'm still getting over, floating over the house.  Over the.  I still don't know how he did that. 
[01:45:00]  How did I love floating?  How did I be floating over the house?  Shaq balloon's everywhere.  Shaq balloon is everywhere.  That's the thing.  That ain't what Matt Barnes was trying to say.  Exactly.  Matt Barnes was trying to say.  What was Matt Barnes trying to say?  Stop earning.  And we've had this same conversation on this show the last couple of years.  Blake Griffiths, I like you.  You seem like a nice kid.  I never even met you.  You're a very good player.  But people are starting to talk. 
[01:45:30]  And you know the people.  Other guys are just starting to knock the hell out of you all the time.  You ain't got to hurt anybody.  People who fight all the time, they're punks.  People, they're punks.  I guess we're not going to hear Shaq.  I thought Shaq was going to try me in.  Shaq just apparently sits there.  Yeah.  Oh, is that Shaq right there?  I didn't even see what that was.  Oh.  Yeah, that was.  I didn't realize it was Shaq.  Oh, yeah.  He's part of the broadcast.  He fell on his face the other day, too, which was hilarious.  Did he?  Yeah.  He had slippery shoes on.  Oh, shit.  And they were doing a little something something. 
[01:46:00]  I had some slippery shoes.  He was running to the other side of the studio.  And boy, did he face-plap.  Did people laugh at him?  Oh, my God.  It's probably bad when he falls.  He's a clown.  Oh, he fell.  He fell.  He fell.  He fell.  He fell.  He fell.  He's got loafers on on a polished studio floor.  He fell.  He was running.  And poof.  Oh.  I bet that hurt. 
[01:46:30]  Stay down.  Stay down.  All right.  That's funny.  I don't know why I was running across the studio.  I have no idea, because there was no, like, fall involved.  Big guys like that falling.  Jesus.  The joy in the other.  That's as basic as you can get.  If you don't know what a man is, listen to the joy in that guy's voice.  He fell.  He fell.  He loved it.  Dude, there's nothing funny about it.  You laugh every time.  Every time.  That is so true.  You laugh even before asking the person if they're okay.  Yeah.  You get your laughing, and then maybe you go, all right. 
[01:47:00]  Are you all right?  You good?  Yeah, yeah.  So Brian Gumbel, I guess, heard Charles Barkley, and then he had his own take on the N-word,  and this just came out over the weekend, so let's listen to this.  I'm Brian Gumbel with a few words about words.  Between the NFL's locker room flap in Miami and the tweets of the NBA's Matt Barnes, the  use of the N-word seems to be on everyone's lips these days.  So for jocks of all colors, I'd like to offer a few guidelines, or personal truths, gleaned  from over 40 years in locker rooms and 65 years of being black. 
[01:47:30]  Truth number one.  No matter what color you are, no one else can give you a pass to say the word.  Not once, not ever.  Passes don't exist.  You shouldn't even want one.  What?  Truth number two.  Be smart.  Using the N-word says a lot about you, and none of it is good.  Oh.  Just advertises your ignorance.  Truth number three.  Pronouncing it with an A after the double G in the word because you're with your boys  makes you no more with it than the clown who pronounces it with the E-R.  Really?  Truth number four.  Being young is not an excuse.  The words used as a weapon to define, demean, and destroy millions of people should never 
[01:48:00]  be forgotten.  Oh, my God.  If you need help remembering, check out the new film 12 Years of Story, and you'll never  view the N-word the same way again.  I bet you will.  Lastly, stop believing in fairy tales.  That old kid's line, sticks and stones, may break your bones, but words can never hurt  you.  Not true.  I'm Brian Cohn.  You know what?  I have no problem with that.  Because he's not asking for anybody to say it or not say it.  This guy can say it here.  He's just saying, hey, the word is very damaging, and he doesn't... 
[01:48:30]  The more you know.  Just his opinion.  That's fair.  The more you know.  My problem is I've been hanging out with Who Kid all this time for no reason.  Yeah.  I thought I was going to get a pass.  No.  You have a pass.  Wait, so we can't...  He said they don't exist.  He said there's no passes.  So you don't get a pass.  Fuck.  And the ER and the GGA is the same thing.  Same deal.  Damn it.  Yeah.  Fuck.  What about that one song?  You mean YG's big hit?  Yeah.  What is that hit again?  You know what's...  My nigga, right?  I love it.  This kind of fucks up Brian Gumbel's thought. 
[01:49:00]  But you know what happens when they play this song?  Yeah.  On the pad data?  Right.  Like on the radio display?  Yeah.  It says my N star star G-A.  Yeah.  Like it won't actually say the word on written, but it's not censored.  It's not the song's uncensored.  Well, that's crazy.  My nigga, my nook.  That's the hypocrisy.  It's...  It's childish.  It's childish.  You have no problem playing the song, but you can't write the word on the pad data.  It's a huge hit. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love this song.  My fuck...  My fuck nigga.  Niggas.  My nigga.  I like this guy.  My motherfucking niggas.  You'll never be cool.  Oh, this is great.  How do you make that word even cooler? 
[01:50:00]  He figured it out.  Oh, yeah.  Let me call my nigga.  You gotta be able to dance to it.  That's how you make it cool.  Yeah, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Look at him.  He's pulling triggers.  Oh, yeah.  He's pulling triggers.  He'll probably die with his finger on the trigger.  Probably.  And you know what he's got in his hand right there?  What?  He's got that styrofoam cup.  Oh, yeah.  You know what that is?  What?  Probably had coffee.  He's on his way to the job.  I know. 
[01:50:30]  I had a container of coffee.  I don't think so, regular Joe.  And some of that drank.  Some drank.  Why styrofoam?  Scissor.  He's getting twisted.  Oh, yeah.  Scissor up.  Scissor.  He's getting twisted.  He's down for his niggas.  He's down for his niggas. 
[01:51:00]  He's down for his niggas.  Fuck the mother niggas.  I'm gonna ride for my motherfucking niggas.  Do you think Brian Gumbel, like, cranks this up in his car with the windows rolled up?  A hundred percent.  Yeah.  He loves this song.  My niggas.  My niggas.  My niggas.  You think these boys will get the Brian Gumbel message?  Yeah.  They'll watch that show and say, you know what?  Find the error in their ways.  Why do black guys always have to look hard when they take pictures?  Like, there's not one picture where they're, like, smiling high. 
[01:51:30]  No.  It's always like, hmm.  You gotta look hard.  You gotta look all hard.  Yeah.  Edge easy.  This song must not be liked by people that do not like it.  I don't like the n-word.  Probably not. 
[01:52:00]  I would assume.  I mean, but, like, Young Jeezy used to be known as the snowman.  Yeah.  Which implies that he sells cocaine.  Oh, see?  That's, uh...  Yeah.  Maybe he just likes the winter.  Well, they got a huge sign in the back that just says blow.  That just says blow.  Yeah.  That's a nice fucking six-po.  Drinking.  I mean, it's coding.  That's a prescription.  And he's hanging out with his crew. 
[01:52:30]  He's got a crew.  It's his niggas.  How great is that song?  He's posing outside the Atlanta City Detention Center.  Detention Center.  Which, you know, because he gets...  All proud and shit.  Because he got out.  He didn't rat.  Right.  And he's getting a reward for it.  They're showing that if you don't rat out on your niggas, you can get a nice car and shit.  You get a car.  You get some drank.  Yeah.  Some scissors.  And some fucking blow, I'm sure.  Some blow, probably, from the snowman.  Why does it say blow in the background?  And some scissor-up.  Yeah.  That's exactly right.  Some scissor-up.  Some scissor-up. 
[01:53:00]  Get some jewelry.  All right.  That's a cool song.  You like it?  That really is a good one, man.  I like the one, I know it's old now, but we started from the bottom, but now we're here.  Started from the bottom, now we're here?  Right.  I say it proper, but now we are here.  Now we are reciting.  Here.  That's another one.  Started from the bottom, but now we are here.  Freely uses that word.  Oh, really?  Let's hear that.  Oh, my God.  I didn't know that word was in there.  Are you kidding me?  Is it peppered about?  Oh, is it? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Oh, is it?  I love that song.  Yeah.  Okay.  Explicit version.  This is like a crossover hit.  That's how big this song is.  It's crazy.  Yeah, this is Drake.  91 million hits on YouTube.  Jesus.  Motherfucking Drake.  It gets played everywhere.  I was happy Shaq blew and did 25,000.  Nigga.  That's what he throws out.  Yeah.  There it is. 
[01:54:00]  It's peppered.  He's had to throw it in.  Started from the bottom, now the whole team fucking here.  I didn't care for real from the jump.  My question is, what do they have to do to get here?  And that's his actual mother, his white Jewish mom.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's got the white Jewish mom.  Is he half and half, or is she a double?  How doesn't he acknowledge the Jewish side?  Well, he does.  Is that cool?  He put her in a video.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Wait, is he half black and half white, or is he?  Oh, okay.  He's got a Jewish mom.  I didn't know if it was a daughter.  It was a birth mother.  And Canadian, on top of that.  What do these people do to get here, though?  What happened?  Well, they started from the bottom.  Right, but who had to suffer for them to get here now?  What do they do?  They don't have new friends.  Slank some dope for a little while.  Do they explain how they got here?  Yeah, he'll explain.  Is Drake popular?  Sell your records?  Is he better than Pitbull, though?  Well, Pitbull's good.  I mean, Pitbull's just shit.  He's good. 
[01:55:00]  Pitbull's just a whole other thing.  Is he a street cred?  No, Pitbull's a piece of garbage.  No, he's not.  He's got some catchy stuff.  He's good.  Yeah, he's got that true.  I want to know what this gang did to get here.  Well, it's not a gang.  It's a crew.  A crew.  I'm a little nervous.  Did they break some laws to get here?  No.  He didn't kept it real from the jump.  Living at his mama's house, he'd argue every month.  N-word.  N-word?  Is that in the song?  Yeah, that's the lyrics of the song.  Oh, let's hear it.  So, good boy, making good.  Yeah, listen to the lyrics. 
[01:55:30]  Nigga started from the bottom, now we're here.  Started from the bottom, now the whole team's fucking here.  I done kept it real from the jump.  Okay, so he always kept it real.  Drake likes to tell him, though.  Is he really allowed to fucking say that word?  Huh?  He's a great voice, this guy.  See, his uncle would call him the N-word. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because he let him borrow the car, but Drake was stuck in traffic after work.  Was it the father's brother or the mother's brother?  Big difference.  His mom's brother.  Where's my car, yo, nigger?  Totally different, Tom.  We got a hardcore.  It's a great angle.  We got a hardcore checking in, Mark, in Jersey.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  What's up, Mark?  I got a quick comment for that Lil Wayne and Drake incident. 
[01:56:30]  Man, that is straight trash right there.  Ain't none of them dudes is really what they talk about.  What the fuck are you talking about?  What incident do you mean?  What happened?  The whole song.  Oh, the song.  What song?  It's my nigga that.  Tell you the truth, black folks don't do that.  Every other word ain't nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga.  I don't know.  I saw that YG video.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, they stand and raps, but they ain't really about their life.  And then the whole Drake thing.  We started from the bottom. 
[01:57:00]  He was filthy rich before he even got on Nickelodeon and started rapping.  So as far as it started from the bottom.  Wait, Drake was always rich?  Well, he was not.  He was a child.  Son of a bitch.  He was a child actor.  Misrepresenting.  He was not Degrassi.  His mom was rich.  His mom was rich from what?  I think she was a lawyer.  A lawyer?  It's him.  This guy has no street cred.  That's how good.  But it's not a secret.  That's how good he is.  That he came out of this Canadian teenage melodrama show. 
[01:57:30]  He's on Degrassi.  The Next Generation.  That's a Canadian show?  Yeah.  But it came to America.  Who else is on there?  No one famous.  He's not even American?  No one famous on there?  No, he's Canadian.  Oh, God.  He is fucking good, though, man.  But he's good enough that he got past it.  Got past what?  He has no street cred?  People love him, dude.  He's making believe he's hardcore.  Hardcore.  Hardcore.  I'm whore.  Hardcore.  Hardcore.  I'm whore.  I'm Canadian, eh?  I'm gangsta, eh?  It's tough to be a Canadian dude with this in your past.  We're in Canada, because Toronto's got some dicey areas. 
[01:58:00]  That was Toronto, I think.  Oh, yeah.  Toronto's got some shitty areas.  But not for the kids on Degrassi.  Yeah, but not for Drake.  He had a Jewish lawyer mom.  But he is quite a good rapper.  Mark, who should we be listening to?  You're saying that we're playing the worst rappers in the world right now.  What?  Drake is a shoot?  Are you saying Sugarhill Gang?  Because that's who I'm in with.  That's right.  Little Wonder Mice.  I said a hip hop.  A hippie nigga.  A hippie nigga.  A hippie hip hop.  But you don't stop.  Rockin' nigga.  Anybody with some good lyrics.  You know what I mean? 
[01:58:30]  Kendrick Moore.  Things of that nature.  Okay, what do you think?  I like this Drake song a lot.  Wait, wait, wait.  I've never heard this.  I love this song.  Yeah.  Hey, Mark, turn us on to one song that no one knows in this room.  Yeah.  One?  No one knows?  That you think is way better than this Drake song.  Abba, Dancing Queen.  D-Block.  You know, the Rough Riders and DMX and them.  I don't know.  I know a little D-Block.  Anything, anything, anything from D-Block.  Anything from, you know, even Jay-Z.  I'm not really a Jay-Z fan like that. 
[01:59:00]  Even Jay-Z.  No, I don't like him either.  Oh, forget it.  Jay-Z's a fucking man.  All right, thanks, buddy.  All right, Mark.  You're supposed to come up with a song.  Not have us, like, just figure out which one.  Drake is better than Jay-Z.  I'm enjoying this more.  Come on, stop.  Much more.  All right, Drake is better than Jay-Z.  I don't enjoy his rap.  Oh, shit.  I don't enjoy what he does.  You're a goofball.  No, I've heard of him.  I've tried to like it.  No, Sam is just a Jay-Z ass licker.  But 99 Problems and the B-J1, that's not, it's not, it's corny to me.  It's not good.  What are you talking about?  I like, I like, I like his voice, though.  Jay-Z, just, I don't like his fucking, his, um, I don't like the tone of his voice when 
[01:59:30]  he's saying, I just don't enjoy lyrically what he does.  You're out of your mind.  No, I'm not.  I have two fucking things on the side of my head that process it and tell me that it's not  good.  I'd prefer to listen to Eminem or Old Run DMC.  Hey, I'll fucking pop lock for hours.  You're all over the place.  Personal choice we all need to make.  Of course.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Want to play more of the Drake song?  Yeah, I do.  But it doesn't get much better.  It's fucking awesome the whole way through.  Yeah. 
[02:00:00]  But that's what, it just stays right there, though.  No, it's awesome the whole way through and he starts, you want to talk about peppering  in N-bombs.  All right, let's hear that.  There's a lot more to come.  Oh, that's great.  I gave you the keys so you bring it right back, nigga.  I just think it's pretty high.  Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show.  Started from the bottom now.  It's a little comic interlude for the video.  Like this?  Oh, I like that.  Holy shit, who's that? 
[02:00:30]  It's a video ho.  Oh, my gosh.  Hi.  Hi.  Damn.  Holy shit, she looks great.  Top season is the Regime, babe.  I can't tell you anything else.  This is...  Why would you do this to his video?  What?  This is horrible.  She's beautiful.  She's definitely affected the hit count.  He's looking right at her tits.  Good call, Chip.  Yeah, she looks pretty good.  No, thanks.  Is he just reciting the lyrics to the song?  Mm-mm.  Yo, your girlfriend's on the phone, man. 
[02:01:00]  She sounds super pregnant.  Laquisha.  I don't know what that.  I'm going to be all right.  Fine.  You look just like my ex-girlfriend.  This is not good.  It's horrible.  Hip-hop artists love the little interludes, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but how about a good one?  I can write a better one than this.  My treat.  You should.  Contact Drake.  That's all on me.  Come on.  Yes.  Mr. Drake.  Don't be shy now.  Oh, thanks.  Or be shy.  Okay.  I look way different when I'm not in my work clothes.  Oh, right.  Yeah, now we're back.  All right, we're finally back. 
[02:01:30]  Terrible.  Now my whole team fucking here.  Started from the bottom, now we're here.  Yeah.  Started from the bottom, now the whole team here.  Nigga.  Started from the bottom, now we're here.  Started from the bottom, now we're here.  When he's a rapper, he's not hanging out with those two corny white guys.  He's falling.  Yeah, now.  He's dancing in the store.  Did he used to work there?  Well, that's the story of the video.  Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry.  Yeah, I doubt it, nigga.  I can turn your boy into the man.  There ain't really much out here that's popping off without us, nigga. 
[02:02:00]  We just want the credit where it's due.  I'ma worry about me, give a fuck about you, nigga.  Just as a reminder to myself.  I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house.  Because we started from the bottom, now we're here.  Started from the bottom, now we're here.  He wears all his jewelry when he's just sitting at home.  That's a reminder.  It's like Anthony with his guns.  Yes.  Even when I'm in a hot tub, I got a gun, nigga.  Got a velociraptor in my house.  I got to remember, yo. 
[02:02:30]  All right, that's cool.  Explain it.  Explain it.  Damn.  Well, we're going to break and do some Alex Jones.  I've been teasing that all morning.  I don't know why.  What the fuck?  I guess we've been distracted just shooting the shit.  Yeah, we have been.  So we'll clear the field and do Alex Jones next.  Alex, because he's in the middle of another conspiracy.  Oh, he certainly is.  He's in the middle of a tyranny with a conspiracy, with a little false flag mixed in for good measure. 
[02:03:00]  It's a great clip, actually.  Gulf of Tonkin.  Yeah.  But first this.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Check the old Twitter during the break.  Oh, yeah.  I like to check the Twitter every once in a while. 
[02:03:30]  I'm Opie Radio on Twitter.  Opie, by the way.  People still can't spell my name.  Opie, why do they do that still?  Is that the...  So Opie Radio.  Then you got Anthony Cumia on the Twitter.  And Jim Norton on the Twitter.  And people are telling me that you've got to listen to the Lil Jon song before you move  on from the N-Word songs.  Which one?  I don't know.  It's called like N-Word Roll Call.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  Damn.  It's hard to have a serious discussion about the word when these songs are extremely popular  in pop culture.  Extremely popular.  What?  This one's like four years old at least.  Probably more.  Maybe ten years old.  But Jesus.  They're just saying that, you know, this is a good one too.  I don't care when it came out. 
[02:04:30]  What's nice about that?  He's a fucking man.  Pause.  You like him?  Lil Jon?  Yeah, he's the shit.  There's no singing talent there though.  No, nothing.  Whatever happened to yesterday?  Oh my God.  Oh my.  Trouble seems so far away, nigga.  Yeah, now it's holy.  I don't know what the hell's going on.  It's just a party.  Oh, okay.  He brings the party.  All right, let me hear this a little bit.  Yeah, I like this. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, I like this.  Oh yeah.  The kid dancing on TV works with this song, huh? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, he's on CNN.  And they're all laughing behind.  Boy, don't beat your ass.  Man, if you're watching, there we are.  That's hilarious.  What a great sync up we got going on with CNN and this song.  This is like Pink Floyd in Wizard of Oz.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It really fits. 
[02:06:00]  Does John realize it's going to be tough to get airplay with this song?  He did just fine for himself.  Is it all right with this song?  Well, this song wasn't.  This one could be the worst of all of them.  I like it.  Because not only is he saying the word a lot, it's also layered underneath as he's saying it.  And it's angry.  Bitch.  Yeah, there's some anger here.  Do you know the lyrics? 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  I like this.  That's called harmonizing.  They're harmonizing.  Yeah, yeah.  It's amazing the rhyme scheme, though.  I know.  The ice cube. 
[02:07:00]  What?  Sounds like it.  Doesn't he have like, doesn't he do like the fucking vacation kid shows?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Movies?  Yeah.  But I mean, he was also shooting guns in Compton.  I have a feeling people are going to continue using the word, even though Brian Gumbel would  like people to think twice about it before they use it.  Because, like, little John is so much cooler than Brian Gumbel.  Yeah, totally.  Brian Gumbel is like a dork deluxe.  Hey, your buddy's down there.  Your Mythbuster buddies are down at Fox.  What? 
[02:07:30]  They're shooting the pumpkin cannons.  Who are these guys?  The Mythbusters.  They got...  They used to do our show.  Well, no, not those two.  The other ones.  The girl.  What's her name there?  Carrie Byron.  Carrie.  Carrie or whatever.  I want to sleep with her.  Well, you should see if she will.  She's pretty cute.  She's got that right here.  They're shooting the pumpkins.  Yeah, they're shooting the pumpkins.  She's very dangerous.  Because they do that pumpkin.  But they got one of those giant, like, pneumatic pumpkin launchers sitting out there parked.  A trebuchet or whatever the hell. 
[02:08:00]  No, it's not one of those, but they've used those.  What are those called again?  The trebuchet, yes.  The trebuchet.  But they got this giant pneumatic one that just fucking...  It could shoot that fucking thing.  If they fired it there, it could probably hit, like, Madison Square Garden.  Wow.  With it.  Very cool.  No problem.  Well, there you go.  The little John song.  So I think people are going to be using the N-word.  I think we, you know, let the N-word out of the barn, and it's going to be pretty tough to go get it and bring it back into the barn.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  That horse has left the barn.  We squeeze the N-word out of the toothpaste.  Oh, yeah.  Container, whatever the hell it's called.  Oh, yeah.  You can't put it back in.  We're not going to be putting it back in anytime soon.  Oh, they are using one of the little pneumatic ones?  Yeah, but they probably don't.  That's a little one.  They probably didn't crank it up, really.  Yeah, no.  They probably haven't.  They would launch it out into sixth.  They should hit the building across the street.  How great would that be?  Right through a cab window.  The cabby fucking...  Tell them they can aim at our office window. 
[02:09:00]  We're not in there.  Oh, that'd be great.  Well, can we see what Alex Jones was up to?  So you got the 50th anniversary of the JFK thing all weekend long, and he went down to  Dealey Plaza.  To make it about him.  And there was a huge crowd down there.  Huge, right?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  He tried to gather like a protest thing going on.  Yeah.  What is he protesting?  He's just being a general rebel rouser, I think.  Oh, boy.  Or rabble rouser.  Yeah, rebel rouser's not a thing.  It's not a thing?  No stupid thing.  It's rabble.  Doesn't he live there, though?  Isn't he a Dallas guy? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, he's a Texas guy.  Yeah.  I'm not sure what part, but...  Yeah, we gotta get everybody together.  There's a problem.  Yeah.  Protesters.  So, to set up the clip...  He's such a douche.  The cops were like,  All right, Alex.  You had your time.  And they were just trying to get him out of the area.  A little crowd-controlled.  And that's it.  I watched the video.  I know.  And the cops were really courteous.  And there was this one douchebag  who's got the camera on himself.  And he's like,  The brutality.  The just utter brutality 
[02:10:00]  of the Dallas Sheriff Department here.  And they weren't doing anything.  They just are trying to do their jobs.  And these dumb protesters  were screaming in the cops' faces.  And the cops are just standing there  with their hands folded.  Just going,  You gotta stay back.  You gotta stay back.  This brutality!  Stand down!  They were told to stand down!  Stand down.  Ah, stand down.  Silly little kids.  Shut up.  Exactly.  Can you tilt that screen  so I can see it, Sam? 
[02:10:30]  And then I guess Alex Jones  worked his way up  to the police line there.  Okay.  And got his bullhorn out.  Okay.  And started telling the cops  what of it.  You know,  giving him a little,  hey,  this won't be stood for  in America.  You've never been  to Daly Plaza, right?  No.  You know there's another half  that looks exactly like the half?  Yeah, on the other side.  And that half gets  no attention whatsoever.  No.  And it's the mirror image  of where it all went down.  By the way,  the title of this,  maybe we're thinking  of different videos. 
[02:11:00]  The title of this video  is Rampaging Federalized  Police Attack  First Amendment  Demonstrators.  Yeah, I didn't see that.  That doesn't sound like  what you're saying.  I didn't see Rampaging...  This video might have been  mistitled a little bit.  They were very courteous.  Well, let's have an open mind.  Let's see.  Info Wars.  This is a usual tactic 
[02:11:30]  to kind of  the crowd.  They're not attacking  or hurting anybody.  I'll give Alex  a couple extra shoves, though.  You think?  Yeah.  But he also won't move.  He's not as cooperative  as the others.  He's not moving.  I'm being assaulted here.  I'm being assaulted.  All right.  He's ready to turn  his megaphone on.  You guys are engaging  in tyranny. 
[02:12:00]  Tyranny.  That's tyranny?  It's exhausting.  Yes.  Yeah, this is just like  Tiananmen Square.  Is it?  Yeah.  Who's that?  Some nerd from Tiananmen?  Yes, he's a square.  Boo.  And the cameraman...  The camera... 
[02:12:30]  The camera...  They usually rock the camera  a little more than they have to  to make it look...  Right.  There's not really  anything going on here.  There's nothing going on.  This stinks.  This is the federalized police  running rampant.  A rampage.  It looks like a guy  that just wants to  make some money  to pay his bills.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's no deep, dark secret there.  Hey, if we would have resisted  and beat their ass,  they would have started 
[02:13:00]  shooting us  in Tiananmen Square  would have started.  Imagine Tiananmen Square.  In Tiananmen Square.  76 almost started right there.  Because if we'd have started  beating their ass,  their cowards,  they'd have shot us.  And I was literally thinking about  when the cops walk over  and one punches me  in the stomach  before they even started pushing,  I literally thought right there,  do we want 1776 to start?  Because those cowards  would have started  shooting people,  including children.  But doesn't he want some?  I mean,  those guys were a bunch of goons  who thought they were  and it was a white guy,  a short, big white guy  walked up first.  He got right there 
[02:13:30]  and he goes,  pow, right in my stomach.  Um, where?  I didn't see the pow  in the stomach.  And he re-showed it.  And you don't see anything?  No, no.  Shouldn't have re-showed it.  They got him cornered.  They pushed a little girl right here.  They pushed a little girl.  Oh my God.  He's running over there.  Let me, let me get her.  Where, who pushed a little girl?  Yeah, where is she? 
[02:14:00]  Where?  Do you honestly think  the police would have started  shooting everybody  and the children?  Yeah, shooting the children.  If they would have taken  a swing at the cops?  Or do you think  they would have  pinned him down  and handcuffed him?  Shame on you!  Shame on you!  Shame on you!  Shame on you!  Oh, the old shame on you.  Here they're talking to Alex.  Yeah. 
[02:14:30]  Where's the tanks?  Yeah.  Running people over  and killing them.  I lost you in the stomach right now.  You and your dudes  would try to jump on me  and break my back.  Well,  that's how cowards are.  You know something  that every one of us is.  I can't imagine  being that big of a wolf, man.  I can't imagine  when, I mean,  I'm not a bulldog.  He's like right in the face  of these cops  that are holding their line.  How do you stand up  if it's me?  Huh?  I guarantee you  you're a bunch  of damn cowards  and I hope you enjoy 
[02:15:00]  the lawsuits you get.  Wow.  Wait, why would,  let me ask you,  if it's such a conspiracy,  why would you trust  an American court  and file a legal action?  Right.  Wouldn't they be in cahoots  with the government?  Yeah, the government  can control it.  And the conspiracies?  Yeah, they control everything  but not your fucking  civil litigation.  Great point.  That was so ridiculously  What was he even trying to do?  I don't even know  what he was trying to do.  Nothing happened.  But what was he trying to do?  I don't even know.  What was he trying to do? 
[02:15:30]  I don't even know  what his goal was there.  That wasn't even  Dealey Plaza.  Where was he?  Wow.  Wow.  What does it say  in the description?  Well,  Dallas Sheriff's deputies  assaulted peaceful demonstrators  almost immediately  after arriving  at the Dealey Plaza  Oh, that was Dealey?  Well, alright.  And proceeded  Maybe they didn't let him  get close or something?  to push the free speech activists  back at least one block  in today's violent assault 
[02:16:00]  initiated by law enforcement.  Violent assault?  We just watched it.  It's not...  Yeah.  He posted it.  Why would you say  violent assault  and then post...  You don't have to post everything.  Like that.  That one didn't work  as well as the other ones.  Just let it go.  You'll have another hit  right around the corner.  This is just like  Tiananmen Square.  So you're saying  that's cutting room  floor material?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, and you should have  posted a funny video.  Oh.  Some kind of wackiness 
[02:16:30]  happening while you were  down there.  Spread some laughs.  Any examples of  something that could be  perceived as wacky  or funny?  Maybe you could make  a phone call to somebody  and pretend you're  somebody else.  Oh, like, okay.  He's in Tiananmen Square.  Tiananmen Square.  Dealey Plaza.  Same thing, according to him.  And he makes a call.  Who would he call?  I don't even...  Hey, this is...  This is...  Larry Harvey Oswald  Ruby Jack.  Yeah.  I need a new 
[02:17:00]  suit jacket.  I was down there  trying to do some  vacationing,  and I got brain matter  all over mine.  What was the motive of the cops there, too, 
[02:17:30]  by the way?  What were they preventing?  I think it was the 50th.  Alex had like 20 people with him.  That was it.  I think it was the 50th.  So, okay.  So what was he trying to get done,  Alex Jones, that he couldn't do  because the cops pushed him back?  I'm just speculating here,  but I bet it was,  hey, release the documents.  Okay.  Hey, you know,  let us talk to these people  or something about the Kennedy thing.  I'm sure it was Kennedy. 
[02:18:00]  But no one was there to talk to.  No.  So, release what...  Does no one...  And then he probably wanted  to get closer to...  Where it happened?  Where it happened.  Yeah.  I want to...  I want to get up in there  and sign the book depository.  He's probably trying to ask  for unreasonable access.  You should let us in there  so we can see  that the vantage point  is obvious.  Oswald could not make the shot.  Really?  Is that what happened?  What happened?  We're being beaten to a pulp here. 
[02:18:30]  No, you're really not.  I'm watching the video.  Is the camera's not even broken?  No, no.  No cameras were broken.  Nothing happened.  What happened?  Violent assault.  There's some weird thing going on.  Is there?  Where?  I don't know.  There's nothing weird.  I was telling Eric  to call Alex Jones.  Oh, God.  I remember.  So not today.  We just wanted it easy today.  You mean,  well, we should get  to the bottom of this.  I don't know.  If not Alex Jones,  then at least Bobo.  Actually,  that clip just sat there  so maybe we do need 
[02:19:00]  Alex Jones to pump it up  because we don't really  understand what was going on.  Yeah,  they didn't have  the proper camera angles  to see the big punch  that was delivered  to my midsection.  But they went back  to the footage  and I was watching  the white guy.  If you notice,  it looked exactly like  when Ruby shot Oswald.  He was standing there  and I got punched  in the midsection.  Really?  Did you?  No, you didn't.  Ooh.  Got a text message.  I was watching  a lot of the Kennedy stuff 
[02:19:30]  over the weekend  and when you watch  that shot  by Ruby  into Oswald,  it looks like  a gut shot  like he just shoots  him in the stomach  and it's  you're kind of like  like he died  from that.  It seems like  it wouldn't have been  that fatal a shot.  I don't know.  A lot of people live  from that type of thing, right?  When you read  the autopsy report,  he hit like  every fucking  vital organ  with that one bullet.  Oh, yeah.  It went in, 
[02:20:00]  hit like  the kidney,  his spleen,  his liver,  the aorta,  a renal fucking artery.  He just bled to death.  Why would he try  for the heart?  I think he was.  He went up  into his chest  a little bit  but the gun  must have went down  a bit.  It wound up  wiping out  like so much shit  inside of him.  He just bled to death.  He did a great service.  Even though  it began  the conspiracy stuff  took off,  Jack Ruby did  a great service  because he killed  that fucking  worthless, 
[02:20:30]  worthless little  bag of shit  and now  there's no  platform for Oswald  to fucking  babble on  and he can't be  interviewed  and be an anti-hero.  Now he's just  some dead cunt  that people thought  was a patsy.  Honestly,  when you look  at how it happened  too,  it was such  circumstance  that Ruby  went there.  When you look  at all the facts,  he was just  home watching  television.  I think Oswald  was supposed  to have been  moved out  of the police  station  at the time  Ruby was  still at home.  So there was 
[02:21:00]  no schedule  that he was  on.  Supposedly he was  home three minutes  prior or something.  A lot of people  think he was  hanging there  for a while.  He ran down  there and was  only there for  a few minutes  tops.  He went to  Western Union  to pay for  some dancer  to send  her 20 bucks.  So he does  that and  then he looked  over and  noticed that  there was a  crowd by the  police station  and went over  there and was  like,  oh,  look at that.  I could walk  right in here  and shot him 
[02:21:30]  on a whim  thinking that  no one would  do anything.  They thought  they'd be  like,  good job.  Do a good  job there.  You're free  to go.  Not quite.  You would  think,  though.  You would  think,  right?  The guy that  killed the  president,  you would  think you  would get a  pass on  killing that  guy.  And how  fast they  got Oswald  in that  movie theater,  that's the  oddest part  of the  whole thing  to me,  is how  minutes after  the fucking  assassination,  for the most  part,  like 45 minutes 
[02:22:00]  was it?  Yeah,  but he was  followed there  by people  who saw  him killed  so he  was followed.  Okay,  okay.  So people  told the  cops where  they were.  But what  did he do  wrong?  He got out  of the  building.  Yeah,  and then he  shot a  cop.  But why  was that  cop  suspicious?  The cop  was just  driving slow.  I don't  know if  they were  looking at  it.  And he  was seen  walking  quickly.  I mean,  when the  president's  murdered and  they don't  have a  suspect,  everyone's  looking at  everybody.  And then you  see this  lone guy  walking  suspiciously.  But why  wouldn't he  walk slowly? 
[02:22:30]  He took a  bus.  I think he  took a cab  or a bus  home.  Yeah,  yeah.  You know?  Took the  bus home.  But where  did the  suspicions  start?  I don't  know.  He got  out of the  building fine,  obviously.  He went  home.  But did  someone in  the building  go,  wait a  minute,  what the  fuck,  and alert  somebody else?  They might  have noticed  immediately after  that he was  missing.  They might have  accounted for the  employees who were  there that day,  just not  him.  Yeah.  So that might  have been how his  name first got  out there. 
[02:23:00]  But I think  initially they  followed him to  the movie theater  because people  followed him.  Oh,  I didn't know  people had  followed him to  the movie theater.  Yeah,  people saw where  he went.  Because it was  like,  how the fuck  did they just  decide,  let's go in  this theater  and see if  Oswald's  sitting here.  Yeah,  I've read the  progression.  I don't remember  offhand.  I wish I had a  better memory,  but I've read  how it progressed  and it's  perfectly logical.  Perfectly logical.  Yeah,  I totally believe  it was just  him,  so it must  be.  I believe it.  You're gay  capers. 
[02:23:30]  You really  are.  Yeah,  keep it up.  You know,  same people  that believe  that the  buildings were  hit by planes  and not blown  up with  demolition that  was put in  there months  in advance.  Kick it,  Alex Jones,  on the phone.  He's healing  from his kidney  punch.  From the  big punch.  Everyone knows  you could have  an office building  working with  people working  in it and  bring demolition  crews in to  plant explosives  in the walls  and blow the  building up with  people, you know,  secretaries and 
[02:24:00]  whatnot, working  in the building.  That's Alex.  Come on.  Can we play the  clip from the  Denver TV station?  Is it a video  or just the audio?  We could play  the video if you  want.  Yeah, because it  will be more  visual for us.  It's a good  clip.  News loves  their weather  clips.  Oh, is this  the guy that  can't say  something?  Nope.  All right,  because I  think that  one's fake.  What's this 
[02:24:30]  guy?  You'll see.  Oh, I  heard about  this guy.  I didn't see  it, though.  I think he's  got a point,  right?  Sure.  It doesn't  matter if it's  the first snow  of the season  or the last.  When it snows  in Colorado,  our viewers  start sending  in photos.  Hundreds of  them come in  with just one  storm, and we  can't help but  notice most of  them show one  thing, snow-covered  patio furniture.  And that bugs  one member of our  team, Kyle Clark,  who is joining us  for a rare on-air  editorial. 
[02:25:00]  Kim, thank you.  I know.  Okay.  Good afternoon,  Colorado.  Listen, you know I  love you, but it  is time that we had  a talk about your  snow-covered patio  furniture.  Why is it that  every time it  snows, we whip out  photos of our  patio sets like  we're showing off  baby photos of  our kids?  Is that really the  best we can do?  We live in one of  the most beautiful  spots on Earth,  but we point our  cameras toward the  back porch.  Yes, everyone is  impressed you have  a four-piece set.  We saw it at 
[02:25:30]  Costco, too.  Chair covers?  Somebody got a  raise.  A grill?  Nice.  Three grills?  Easy there,  Bobby Flay.  Is that a gazebo?  Okay, that's kind  of cool.  But let's be more  original the next  time the snow flies.  You can still  feature your patio  set, but if you  like it, then you  should have put a  thing on it, like a  disgruntled dog, or  your husband drinking  a beer.  You're a pecker.  Better yet, how  about an action shot  of the dog?  Pecker.  Or the husband.  You don't even have  to turn the photo  right side up.  Just crop out the 
[02:26:00]  patio set.  Oh, so close on  this one.  Yeah.  Listen, I know  why we take photos  of snow-covered  patio sets.  It's easy.  Point your camera  out the window  and click.  But are we really  a state that takes  the easy way out?  We blasted a road  through the Rockies.  We put a cliff  inside a Mexican  restaurant.  Wow.  Our welcome sign  is a demon horse  with crazy laser  odds.  Fuck yeah.  We'll do easy  around here.  And you know  what else?  Casa Bonita.  How are you optimistic  to live in a prison 
[02:26:30]  of patio sets?  Fuck yeah.  What a sad way  to celebrate the  new season.  Well, guess  we can't sit  outside on those  anymore.  This guy's a scream.  Would you really  send us a photo  of your skis  in a closet?  No.  It's depressing.  Come on, Colorado.  We love winter.  We own winter.  So let's see  some photos  that look like it  next time it snows.  Please, I'm begging you.  Tired of looking  at patio furniture. 
[02:27:00]  That guy's  fucking hilarious.  Tired of looking  at patio furniture.  Back to you.  Oh, wow.  Why is that clip  popular?  What did he do?  It's just stupid.  I don't know why  these fucking clips  get paid.  Because a lot of  people can relate  to it.  It's awful.  Their local news  does the same thing.  And people take  pictures of the patio  furniture.  How much it snows.  Because you can see  underneath the table.  You can see the  actual table and then  all the white shit.  The level of the snow. 
[02:27:30]  And that's why  people do it.  I didn't like the way  I thought he should  have gone a little  harder with that.  Yeah, maybe.  Why would you take  a picture of your  patio furniture?  Why not a picture  of your wife's tits?  Perhaps with a nice  load between them.  Throw some snow  in her stupid face.  Like a snow angel  with your asshole.  Think that'd  go viral?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's see those  little bleeding  fissure and roid  marks in the snow.  Oh, God.  Is it true 
[02:28:00]  Michael Jackson  didn't change  his underwear  toward the end  of his life?  Yeah.  Conrad Murray  held his penis  every day.  Yes.  Oh, cool.  Had to hold  his penis.  Why is that?  To do a medical  procedure or what?  Would he put a  catheter in every  night when Michael  would get knocked  out because he  couldn't get up  to the bathroom?  Yeah, he would  put a catheter in.  We also said  Michael used to  dribble a lot.  What?  Out of the dick.  Conrad Murray's  an asshole. 
[02:28:30]  What happened  there, though?  He killed  Michael Jackson.  Michael Jackson  was a drug addict  who...  That's how the  headline is,  by the way.  Michael Jackson  was a drug addict  who accidentally  killed himself.  In his first  interview since  getting sprung  from prison,  Murray said he  and Michael Jackson  were unusually  close.  You want to know  how close we were,  Murray told the  mail on Sunday?  I held his penis  every night to  fit a catheter  because he was  incontinent at  night.  Oh, God.  How embarrassing.  Wear diapers.  Why would he  fucking say that?  He'd wet the bed. 
[02:29:00]  He made a lot of  money off Michael  Jackson.  Let him fucking  be.  The six-year-old  Murray released  from prison October  28th, insisted he  was not responsible  for Jackson's death.  I did not kill  Michael Jackson.  He was a drug addict.  Michael Jackson  accidentally killed  Michael Jackson,  Murray said.  Wow.  He was in crisis  at the end of his  life, filled with  panic and misery.  By the end,  Michael Jackson  was a broken man.  I tried to protect  him, but instead I  was brought down  with him.  You're not  protecting him by  saying you held  his fucking penis  every day, you  piece of shit.  He tinkled all 
[02:29:30]  over the place  like he's a big  tinkle monster.  Oh, here it is.  You're right.  Murray claimed  Jackson was so  unhinged in his  final days that he  didn't allow his  underwear to be  clean because he  feared the maids  would sell it.  So what did he do  with his dirty  underpants?  He left them on.  I would have  bought them.  He would leave  on his dirty...  Just one pair?  Yeah, he didn't  change them, right?  So he left them  on.  Left all the little  pee-pee drops and  skid marks.  What do you  smell his underpants?  King of Pop? 
[02:30:00]  Yes.  He was the King of  Pop?  Yes.  I'd go, oh, he  smells just like my  underwear smell.  I would wear them.  Oh.  Not like for a long  period of time.  Well, believe me,  when you were popping  that quarter off your  ankle, you probably  could have gone over  there and smelled  his underwear and  everything that's  under his collar.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Remember, I taught  you, I see London,  I see France, I see  Sammy's underpants.  Oh, God.  I'd do the smell  check while you  were wearing them.  I'd spread your  legs and bury my  nose in there.  Oh, he's rutting. 
[02:30:30]  He's rutting around  in your drawers.  He's getting your  nose in there,  trying to find a  truffle.  Yeah.  A little shit  truffle.  Oh, God.  Damn it.  Disgusting.  God damn it.  I'm quite certain  I would have  remembered that.  Yeah.  Remember your little  slippy footy PJs?  I'd throw you on  your stomach by force  and bury my nose in 
[02:31:00]  there and see if you  was mining your  P's and Q's.  And you'd be  flicking your little  ankle in my hands.  Click, click,  click, click, click.  And I'd be opening  up your legs like  a wishbone smelling.  I'd get in there  at my nose.  Sometimes I'd pull  my nose out.  Your little  your little feety  pajamas would be  crammed into your  bottom because of  the force in which  I use my nose.  You'd forget to  open the hatch.  You'd be so into it.  You wouldn't open  the hatch. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  I'd slam my face  in there.  It looked like that  plane hitting the  runway in Russia.  I would love to know  what's going on  inside you that you  have to act these  out.  That's fantastic.  Act these out.  What happened to you?  Oh, probably lots of  things.  Yeah.  You've got a great  imagination, but I 
[02:32:00]  don't know.  That's based on  something.  Just an imaginative  little boy.  Yeah.  Holding your ankles  while they flicked.  Way too visual.  They're like little  kites.  Oh, they're just  clicking.  His clicking ankles.  You were trying to  flick my fingers off  like they were five  nickels.  No dice.  It's a defense  mechanism.  Keep people's  fingers off of you.  Yeah.  Click.  I'd pick you up  by your ankles  and get in there  and sniff.  Sniff your little  multicolored bag. 
[02:32:30]  I know the front  of your underpants  would always smell  like tinkle  because of your  ballooning  foreskin.  Ballooning  foreskin.  He's got the facts.  Maybe there is  some truth to this.  Yeah, your little  ballooning foreskin.  I heard that  on the after show  the other day  when you were  talking about  your 19-year-old  circumcision.  Yes.  That you got  when you were 19.  And how you  take a piss  and the hole  was so small  in the foreskin  that the foreskin  would blow up  like a water balloon.  True.  Fucked off.  Yeah. 
[02:33:00]  Wow.  Sure, it would  always leak into  your little  Hulk Hogan  underpants.  I could always  tell when you  made a wet.  Why would you  think that's  normal, Sam Roberts?  Why didn't you  show mommy that?  Because there's  no reason to  not think it's  normal if you  don't see...  You thought  everyone had  a balloon dick?  Of course.  Why wouldn't?  If that's the  only dick you  see, you're  like, oh, God.  He did show  mommy.  She said to me,  Paul, check  that out.  Is that  normal?  And I took  you in a room  and checked  it out for a  few hours.  Got in there  and cleaned it. 
[02:33:30]  I don't think we  knew each other  back then.  Oh, that must  have looked  like a fucking...  I don't even know.  like that cake  on the  little rascals  that went  just blowing  up with the  urine.  Old thermometer  dick.  And then you  got to pinch it  to squeeze all  the excess liquid  out.  Oh, my God.  Needs all that.  How many infections  did you have?  How does that  not...  That can't be  clean in there.  I had no  infections or odors. 
[02:34:00]  You must...  How do you...  Your dick must  have stunk.  I know infections  or odors that  I'm aware of.  Wow.  Why don't you  just cut it  yourself?  Cut a little  relief.  Mark Goodman  is on TV.  Oh, look at  that.  Oh, wow.  He's doing the...  What's he got  there?  Well, apparently  there's a button  in the control  room.  Did he get  fired for this?  What did he  do?  I think what he  did was some  illegal activities.  The management  saw him hit that  button that  activates inactive  radios?  He pushed the  free radio button?  Yep.  Why is he 
[02:34:30]  sneaking around  and then telling  a camera?  And still,  no answer to  why they would  position that  secret button  right next to  the window.  It'd say  button.  With a big  sign next to  it.  It'd say  button.  It's not a  real button.  You don't  think so?  No, I was  looking for it.  Jim almost  said that.  What happens  now?  Like radios  get this or  something?  Right now,  all the old  deactivated radios  have been  reactivated.  Nice. 
[02:35:00]  And can  listen to,  I believe,  60 different  SiriusXM channels.  Are we one of  them?  No.  Not that I'm  aware of.  Where's the  button that  makes the  app work?  Oh.  Is that  button around  somewhere?  It's on the  shotgun,  the toe  trigger.  We can maybe  have a button  that fixes the  app on a  daily basis.  We're doing  good today with  the app.  No complaints  today.  Quite  astounding.  Peel in.  Mad dog. 
[02:35:30]  They gave  mad dog,  but not,  I guess,  because we  curse.  Oh, you got  entertainment weekly.  Yeah, because  we curse.  Cool.  If it's free,  they'd be like,  oh, I'm  outraged at  what they're  saying.  So no XL  channels, I  guess, right?  No.  It would  appear not.  Did Letterman  give Howie a  little bashing  when he was  on the show?  I guess Howard  did Letterman  what, Friday  or something  like that?  Yes, he did.  No, I didn't  either. 
[02:36:00]  I was reading  some tweets  and stuff,  and people  said that  Letterman was  saying that  pretty much  that Howard's  a pussy now,  and the old  Howard's gone.  I guess they  got into a  little back  and forth.  Did they  really?  We'll talk  about the  birthday party.  Yeah, I'm  sure.  The birthday  bash.  The big  birthday bash.  I'm going  to it.  No, you're  not.  Are we allowed  to go?  I would  assume not,  no.  Has the  company said  other employees  can go?  We should  be able to.  I'm sure  there will  be some 
[02:36:30]  employees  there, but  I have it  on, I  wouldn't think  that.  We're going,  right?  I don't think  you are, no.  I'm planning  on it.  We work for  this company.  What is it?  When's the  birthday bash?  And if they're  going to have an  ass-kissing party,  we should be  there.  Why?  Why not?  You don't do  that.  What?  It's a birthday  bash.  I don't know  if I'm trying to  see you.  Where's Dennis  Falcone?  He's sitting at  his desk.  Oh, here it is.  Crash the bash.  Crash the bash 
[02:37:00]  sweepstakes.  It's on January  31st, so don't  bother clearing  that on your  calendar because  you will not be  going.  January 31st?  Yep.  Super Bowl  weekend.  Oh.  Oh.  And you can  crash the bash,  huh?  Well, I'm not  going to plug their  contest, but yes.  Didn't it seem like  yesterday we weren't  going to the Super  Bowl?  Yeah.  Wow, it did,  right?  It's right around  the corner where  we're not going to  go to another  Super Bowl.  I love that the  way you figure out  how much time has  passed is, oh,  how long ago was 
[02:37:30]  it that we didn't  go to the Super  Bowl?  No, that was two  Super Bowls ago  that we didn't go  to.  But we're not  going this year,  but it's right  there.  We can't go this  year.  It will make a  clean 20 years  that we never went  to the Super  Bowl.  But it's here.  I know.  That's why it's a  little difficult.  I've never been to  a Super Bowl.  I've been to  three.  No, you haven't.  Three Super Bowls?  Yeah.  Yes, I have been.  No, he's lying.  I went to one,  two, and three.  The radio show I  was doing out in  Wisconsin at the  time.  They sent me as a  stunt boy. 
[02:38:00]  I've never been to  a Super Bowl.  No?  Been to quite a few  World Series.  You know, as a  Yankee fan.  All right.  But never been to  a Super Bowl.  All right.  We heard you.  Never been to a  Super Bowl.  We're going to take  a break because we're  trying to get Dennis  Falcone in here.  And the hotline rang.  I don't know who it  was.  Was it Alex Jones?  Yeah, conspiracy.  I was on the phone  trying to get through  to you, and the cops  came in and punched  me in the gut again.  Did they?  I think you're lying. 
[02:38:30]  All his lines are  busy.  Ah, yeah.  Well, he's talking  to a lot of media  today.  Yeah, I bet he is.  What happened?  What a character.  Oh, Denny.  I got a guest coming  in.  When?  Right now.  What did he do to  what the fuck?  What's going on?  Can we acknowledge it?  I mean, you'd have to,  right?  Dennis Falcone.  Dennis Falcone.  Oh.  Liam Neeson has 
[02:39:00]  entered the studio.  Morning, gentlemen.  How are you?  Hi, Denny.  What do you do?  Getting all ready  for Thanksgiving.  Oh, yeah?  Did you get a lot  of sleep this weekend?  A lot of sleep?  Yeah, I got sleep on it.  You just look younger  and fresher.  Oh, I do my hair  all the time.  Were you painting  the ceiling?  My hair?  Yeah.  Painting the ceiling.  No, just...  Fall into a Sharpie  machine?  No, just color the hair  if that's what you're  getting at.  Cut to the chase?  Give you the payoff  right there?  Yeah. 
[02:39:30]  Well, you are in  entertainment,  so you've got to  keep your looks up,  right?  Well, I mean,  it just doesn't look good,  you know?  You've got the white  peeking through and stuff.  I've got to be honest,  when I'm going to be  on TV doing a red eye  or something,  I head over to  John Sahag,  the hairstylist place,  and I do have  a little color  to put into my hair.  You should die  with a shotgun.  Do you do your teeth  also?  You get the teeth  whitened?  What?  The teeth whitened.  Well, I'm having...  He's getting dentures.  Not dentures. 
[02:40:00]  He uses this special  stuff that comes  from this really  weird hanging bag.  It's almost like  what you squeeze  frosting out of.  He puts his finger  in some buttocks.  Are you implying  I put gum on my teeth?  Yeah, then he gets  a nice teeth cleaning.  I'm getting, you know,  laminates put on.  Yeah, it's great.  Whitened.  Are they on already?  No.  What are you waiting  for?  Well, I have to get  this bridged work  taken care of.  Are you trying to be  worried after Thanksgiving  because you don't get  cranberry sauce all over  the years?  Yes, I don't want  cranberry sauce on my 
[02:40:30]  laminates.  Dyeing your new teeth.  Oh, that's great.  I hope five minutes  after the dentist  all of us,  you trip and you  crack on a bumper.  Holy shit.  $200,000  worth of chick  was on the ground.  $200,000?  Wow.  You're so mean.  Oh, just fucking  jagged remnants.  Oh, shit.  Oh, that would suck.  Slip on some ice  and ride on a bumper. 
[02:41:00]  Right into a fucking  bumper.  Just look at them  all fucking laid out  on the street.  Yeah, just a shattered  bleeding mess.  You have to walk back  in.  You have to pick them  up and try to hope  they can put them  in for you cheap.  Uh, uh, uh.  Fucking suck.  Sorry.  Danny.  Yes, sir.  Danny, what do you do?  You use Just for Men?  Yeah, whatever one  of those things.  Does that make you rash?  You don't think  he goes to the stylist?  No.  That's obvious.  You wouldn't think so?  No.  It wasn't really bad, though.  Jesus.  If you didn't know it,  you know,  if you didn't know the person. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  If you didn't have eyes.  No, if you didn't know  the person,  you would say,  you know,  you wouldn't even notice.  Just for Men,  uh, it's good.  A lot of people  are allergic to it.  Makes them itch  and cause a bad rash.  Is that the shampoo?  Yeah, whatever you wash in.  I don't know.  How long do you leave it?  Five minutes or something.  Yeah.  Do it.  It's fine.  Yeah.  Turn around.  There you go.  It's fine.  It's like you missed  a little on the back.  It's just dark brown.  I mean,  if you do,  if you come in  where it's jet black,  I did that once  and it looks weird.  Wait,  is your scalp all dyed too? 
[02:42:00]  No,  just the hair.  You don't really rub it in.  You just kind of push it through.  Well,  I have crew cuts.  How could I do it?  You wouldn't do it.  That would be silly.  It would look like Charlie Brown  if you did it.  You could tattoo your head.  Oh,  that would be terrible.  I'm going to tattoo hair on my head.  Hey,  man,  you wouldn't be the first.  No,  it's good.  Just a little house cleaning.  Yeah,  the Joey kid.  Joey Lawrence.  Joey Lawrence has tattoo hair.  Tattooing his hair on.  It's creepy looking.  That poor guy.  He just looks good on TV.  Sometimes people have it  on the side of their heads.  They have the haircut. 
[02:42:30]  A lot of kids do that.  They put their team number,  their uniform number on there.  They all cut it in.  Got a couple questions  for you.  20 years ago,  man.  This is an ass kissing party.  It's going down  in late January.  Crash the Bash,  right?  I can't get you tickets for it.  It's Howard Stern's  fake birthday party.  They're paying him probably.  I'm guessing  they're getting him  at least a million to show up.  I'm guessing.  It might be more.  It's a personal appearance?  Absolutely.  It's a real birthday  is two weeks before that.  Are we going to be invited?  I don't think so.  I wouldn't count on it.  Why?  We're part of this company.  We're part of this great company. 
[02:43:00]  Well,  I think you'd want to  okay the guest list.  I think you'd okay the guest list.  Why?  It says Crash the Bash.  If you also don't crash it.  Well,  you can't call it  Crash the Bash then  because we're here to say  we're going to crash the Bash.  Yeah,  but I'm sure they're going to have  a company list of people  who will be invited.  You're going to DJ it?  No,  I wasn't asked yet.  Maybe the Who Kid.  The Who Kid.  Yeah.  Maybe he'll do that.  So we're not going to be invited?  I don't know.  I wouldn't count on it.  That's bullshit.  I'm making plans  for that Friday night.  And then the other thing is  Thanksgiving right around the corner. 
[02:43:30]  What the fuck are we supposed  to be doing  with this radio show?  You're going to run  the best ever you guys  coming in?  A very Chipperson Thanksgiving  is running  where Chip makes appearances  and also Craig Schenkel  helps out  and Edgar  and Uncle Paul  does a little introduction.  God.  Uncle Paul for the holidays.  That would suck.  It's great.  Craig Schenkel  He does drop that  and Valley Jim shows up.  Oh my God.  Are you going to the parade?  Are you bringing the kids  to the parade?  No!  Jesus.  Why not?  Get the hell out of here.  Such a festive thing to do. 
[02:44:00]  No, it's not.  You freeze your balls off  and you can't see anything.  If you come into this building  because the parade  is going to be running  along 6th Avenue  they change the route.  Right.  You could get a nice seat  and the kids can see the floats.  Where?  Yeah.  From our building.  What part?  The 19th floor.  You can see it's a little easier.  Why is it easier at 19?  You get a little closer view  because we're up here  on 36.  Oh.  We're taller.  Yeah, so the kids  would like that.  It'd be a nice thing.  Aren't the balloons  up this high?  If it's too windy  the balloons might not be.  It's going to be cold this year. 
[02:44:30]  Oh boy, is it?  It's going to be cold.  Bundle up.  Yeah.  And the work goes out  for the fleece police, boy.  I tell you.  What's the fleece police?  Well, it's just when you do  the weather.  It's not a real thing.  The fleece police.  It's what we do  to our listeners.  You know something  when you tease the weather?  Yeah.  You know.  What do you say?  Hey boy, you're going to want  to alert the fleece police.  It's going to get below  the freezing notch tonight.  Oh man.  So you put a fleece on  and then everything's okay?  Or get under the bunny skins  or something.  The bunny skins?  What's that? 
[02:45:00]  The blankets.  Get under the bunny skins.  It's getting cold.  How about just call them blankets?  Oh, you could do that too.  People don't like to kill  bunnies anymore.  Yeah.  The rabbit's so cute  little twitchy noses.  And what kind of vibe  should we have on the radio  leading up to Thanksgiving?  Oh, you guys should be  playing some holiday music  or promoting the holiday  channels that we have  here at Sirius XM.  Hell, can that.  What about Thanksgiving  morning?  What should we play?  What should we...  Alice's Restaurant, of course.  Oh, wow.  That's a fucking song.  Yeah.  It sucks.  We're going to be playing  it across the platform.  Are you?  Oh, yeah.  All the channels.  It's terrible.  A lot of opportunities  to catch it. 
[02:45:30]  I was a weekend DJ  and I had to push the button.  Yeah.  It's a great song.  It's not a great song.  It stinks.  It's a whole story.  It's great.  It's fun.  Did you like the movie?  Did you like the movie?  I long acknowledged  there was a movie  and the song is shit.  I've never heard  the whole song.  I hate it.  Well, you should listen to it.  What makes it a great song?  It's just a whole story.  It's funny.  There's a lot of stories  out there.  There's no loads in it.  It's also part of  the history of rock and roll.  Is there farting in it?  Why is it the history 
[02:46:00]  of rock and roll?  Well, it's one of the songs.  I mean, it's such a, you know.  Why can't we get  It's interesting.  Why can't we all get together  and go, this thing stinks.  It was never cool,  so let's move on to something else.  That's your opinion.  And by golly,  you're entitled to it.  I try to start a new tradition.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  Then do something.  So come in every Thanksgiving  and do something that you'd like.  I'd rather listen to  Mr. Customs, man.  I would play Lil Jon  on a loop.  Oh, that's a good song.  Right.  You ever heard that one, Dan?  You gotta do Roll Call.  I have to tinkle.  What?  All right, Pat.  You guys talk about  Alice's Restaurant.  That's adorable.  I have to piss. 
[02:46:30]  Alice's Restaurant.  I like a little Pitbull.  He's got some great party tunes.  Pitbull fucking sucks.  Yeah.  Don't Stop the Party.  A whole bunch of great songs.  Yeah.  You ever heard this one?  This one on your  hard drive of hits, Danny?  You play a lot of, uh...  Yeah, this one.  Yeah!  Right about now.  What's up?  It's time for the  real nigga roll call.  Real nigga roll call.  Then when you hear your city or state,  wait till the chorus kicks in.  It's not that bad.  Wait for the hook.  What are you supposed to do  when you hear your city?  Put your fingers in the air.  Your middle fingers. 
[02:47:00]  New York.  I hear you.  You want to go?  That's not on his holiday album, is it?  That's not on his...  You don't have that on the hard drive?  No, I don't have that one.  I missed that one.  I'll get you a copy.  That was written by Jagger and Richards. 
[02:47:30]  Oh.  Did you know that, right?  Yeah.  I didn't know that was a cover.  Yep.  What was the dirtiest Rolling Stones song?  Motherfuck that bitch.  Oh, the star?  Star, star, right?  Star, star.  Star, star.  Star, star has to be the dirtiest Rolling Stones song.  And there was also the Harry Nilsson song,  You're Breaking My Heart.  I thought that was actually a...  It says Keith Richards and Mick Jagger,  but it was actually an old blues singer.  Oh, really?  Hear that.  Motherfuck that nigga,  Motherfuck that bitch.  Motherfuck that nigga, 
[02:48:00]  Motherfuck that bitch.  Motherfuck that nigga,  Motherfuck that bitch.  Motherfuck that nigga,  Motherfuck that bitch.  Look at you writing the songs there.  That's the old...  No, we stole from the black man, remember?  It was recorded from the 20s.  That guy got no credit.  Little John made it a hit.  Going back to the blues.  Oh, yeah.  What else?  Should we start talking about holiday shopping?  Sure.  Or getting the decorations out for Christmas?  I just kind of think it's sad, though.  A lot of stores are opening up, what,  8 o'clock now on Thanksgiving night?  6 o'clock!  It's ridiculous. 
[02:48:30]  You know, Thanksgiving,  you're supposed to sit down,  eat the meal all day,  watch football,  go back to eating.  It's sad.  But know how many losers  are going to leave their own families  in the middle of Thanksgiving  to get on the stupid line?  It's sad.  It's ridiculous.  There's no reason.  And people who work in the department stores  and the boys...  Now they have to go and work Thanksgiving Day.  So it's like, you know,  they can't be eating and drinking  and carrying on  and having a good time  because they keep looking at the clock  going, oh, I've got to work,  got to work, got to work.  Is it really a good time, Dennis?  I don't think so.  I wouldn't want to be in a party like that. 
[02:49:00]  No, I mean Thanksgiving.  It used to be.  Yeah.  It used to be.  But now it's like Thanksgiving dinner,  more like Thanksgiving lunch,  huh, Dennis?  Let's get through it.  Let's get through it.  Let's get through it.  We've got to go to the stores.  We've got to go to the mall.  I mean, hey,  I want everybody to make money.  I want the economy to do well  and everything,  but it's ridiculous.  I don't think so.  Although I'll probably be out there  early in the morning.  Dennis is still babbling.  I was just being questioned.  I was just being questioned.  He's fighting the war on Thanksgiving.  He's fighting the war.  Yeah.  He's declared war on Thanksgiving.  Screw Bill O'Reilly's Christmas thing. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  It probably is my favorite holiday.  Yeah, it's way better than Christmas.  Yeah.  A lot less pressure and stress.  I've got to...  What?  What happened?  I've got to buy a cake.  For what?  I don't know.  Who's coming?  What?  I've got to buy a cake for what?  I've got to buy a cake.  I don't know.  I've got to go for Thanksgiving.  I want to bring a cake.  Where are you going?  I don't know yet.  Are you going to Bobby's?  I might see family.  I don't know.  Wait, you just know you have to buy a cake,  but you don't know where you're going yet?  Yeah, I want to buy it from that place  that did Roland's birthday cake.  They were so good.  There's going to be a cake.  You can come over to my house. 
[02:50:00]  You should bring pastries.  Pastries are always nice.  Are they?  Yeah.  What kind of cake?  Time pastries.  Cannolis, sfugnadells,  busterchotes,  all those nice things.  What if it's not an Italian Thanksgiving?  Yeah, I don't want to bust the chuttees.  I don't have to buy new chuttees.  No, you're bringing pastries.  It doesn't matter if it's an Italian Thanksgiving.  You're bringing pastries.  It's the dessert.  Isn't the thing to do with buy a pie?  If you'd like buy a pie.  Thanksgiving is pie season.  But the problem is pies have to be picked up the day of, right?  How about strawberry rhubarb?  You like some rhubarb mixed in with the strawberry?  I like pecan pie.  It's my favorite pie. 
[02:50:30]  I like pecan.  Can you buy cake the day before?  Well, your dad's also from another century.  I think you can.  I want it to be fresh,  but I'm flying home Wednesday,  so when will I pick up my pie or cake?  I don't know what to do.  Probably Thursday morning on your way out.  You think so?  Get to your garage early, though,  because of the Thanksgiving Day parade.  Oh, God damn it.  I get fucked every year.  Not this year.  Everyone parks in my building for the parade,  and then the people that are actually paying monthly fees 
[02:51:00]  to park there get fucked.  But you're right.  I can't go pick it up if it's across town.  It's brutal.  Where does the parade go from where to where?  From point A to point B.  Come by my desk.  I have the whole route.  Cool.  I have the whole route.  Of course he has the whole route.  I hope it includes fucking making a left on Elm.  It was a part of a color map  that was in one of the newspapers  that I'm giving out to free.  So you cut it out?  No, it's just a color piece.  It's just a wrapper.  And where is it?  Just sitting on your desk just in case? 
[02:51:30]  Right next to my stand-up picture of Jimmy,  right next to him.  They have really put Denny in the corner.  I know.  Well, they moved him  because he was bothering everybody  when they came in the door.  Because he used to sit right by the door.  You're the reason I'm not a company guy,  guys like you.  I've seen a million of you coming up.  That's right.  That's just a lie.  They just shit on you guys in the end.  No, no, no.  They really do.  No.  I like your serious sweatshirt.  No, no.  I'm happy making $8 an hour.  What's that?  No, this one's old, too.  I need one.  20 hours a week.  I need a new one.  I have to go down to talk to the promotion.  Why pecan pie? 
[02:52:00]  What's up with the pecan pie?  Yeah, and you put a nice scoop,  you warm it up,  put a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream on top.  Of course it has to be vanilla.  Even your ice cream choice is boring.  You put whatever you want on it.  I like a key lime pie.  How about a nice slice of key lime pie?  You know what?  Now we're in agreement, sir.  I love key lime pie.  I love key lime pie.  Give that key lime pie dang court.  Makes your whole mouth go like this.  It's good.  It sucks.  It really does.  I love key lime pie, though.  Pretty tasty shit, though.  I can't complain about that, Dennis. 
[02:52:30]  See, we're finding common ground,  me and you, finally.  Yes, we're just meeting on common ground.  That's all.  What are you doing for the holidays?  I like the nice piece of food.  I've got to ask you.  The Islanders were staying in my hotel  in Philly this weekend,  but I don't know who won the fucking game.  They didn't.  What was the score?  I think 5-2.  5-2.  Yeah.  Things have been in the toilet  since we traded Molson.  Yeah, because Molson was a fucking heart.  You don't trade the heart.  No.  That's very valuable.  It's a shame.  And now up in Buffalo,  Pat LaFontaine is up there.  What is he doing up there? 
[02:53:00]  I think they hired him as general manager  or director of operations or something.  How did he move there?  I guess he got the gig  because he was living out  on the north shore of Long Island.  Trust me, we know.  I remember when he played, of course.  Hey, do they have any party rooms there  where they're looking for DJs for the holidays?  Oh, come on.  Hold on a minute.  The piece of fruitcake is delicious.  Oh, my God.  Alex Jones, I've got to ask you.  How is your gut, man?  We saw the punch.  Holy shit.  Well, it's fine.  I mean, but the whole point is that we went there 
[02:53:30]  because the mayor had said no free speech in Dallas.  And then a judge had put an injunction in  saying you can only stop people during the ceremony  inside a three-blocked area around Dealey Plaza.  And then I talked to the Dallas police chief,  and I realized that was the guy that came over  and said, no, you're right.  You can go in now.  It's 2 o'clock.  They opened up all the barricades.  We went in, and we're just peacefully waiting  to go into Dealey Plaza at the next checkpoint.  And the Dallas police are standing there.  We're talking to them.  And then here comes the sheriff's deputies, 
[02:54:00]  we later learned, federalized out of the federal building.  And then they start attacking people.  Just amazing.  Now, why?  It's weird you didn't catch anything on the video.  I like you guys.  They must have made you shoot around all the violence.  Specifically what?  We didn't seem to see any violence whatsoever on the video.  And it's kind of seedy the way they made you shoot around all of it.  Like, the way they constructed it,  where they probably had, like, whenever there was violence happening,  they probably turned the video guy away. 
[02:54:30]  All I know is there were probably, I don't know, 50 cameras there.  And I got home Saturday night, and I watched some of it yesterday.  Crazy shit, right?  And it was also, like, four or five Ustreams going.  Yeah.  And so there's all sorts of different video and different angles and different stuff.  But, I mean, I was there.  They were, like, ramming people's heads into signs.  They were stomping on people, knocking some little girl off her dad's shoulders.  It was pretty bad.  But, I mean, some of the footage, I haven't watched a ton of it, quite frankly, 
[02:55:00]  just because I've been busy.  But you know what happened, obviously.  Yeah, that's what happened.  John B. Wells, Coast to Coast AM host, he was there and witnessed it all.  Right.  Now, what were they trying to keep you from doing?  Well, the Dallas Morning News lied until we were trying to break into Dealey Plaza.  The event had been over for about 45 minutes, and they kept the streets blocked off.  Everybody was out of there.  You know how when there's a concert or something, how fast things clear out? 
[02:55:30]  Right.  It was cleared out in, like, 10 minutes.  We're sitting there in the rain, waiting to go in.  The judge had said that demonstrators and people that didn't agree with the official Kennedy story,  had to be let in after the event, after it cleared out.  So the police chief of Dallas, and this is all on tape as well, up at the first checkpoint,  after about 30 minutes, made phone calls and said, no, you're right, go on through.  It was real friendly.  Okay.  Go in there.  And then we're waiting to get through the final checkpoint into Dealey Plaza itself.  And the Dallas police were standing there. 
[02:56:00]  And then the feds came over, said some stuff, went over to the federal building, and out  of the federal building came deputized sheriff's deputies who were federal auxiliary special  event police, part of the federalization of police, and they did what they did.  So regardless, we were a lawful, peaceful demonstration and had our first amendment violated.  Well, what was the motivation on their part?  Why would they want you kept out?  Well, they were obviously scared of Alex Jones and his crew. 
[02:56:30]  I don't know what...  Because they can't handle the truth.  No, no, no.  It's very, very simple.  Yeah.  They don't want the idea that demonstrating is legal and lawful in America to send the  message, the chilling effect, that the first amendment will not be tolerated.  Right, right.  And listen, I can tell you guys are being sarcastic.  I was just finishing a short jog of amount of breath.  And I know it's all funny, but listen.  We love you, Alex.  Go ahead.  I know I love you guys, too.  Go ahead. 
[02:57:00]  The NSA is spying on us without warrants on record.  We know that.  They are now preparing publicly, this is in the news today, to bail in and take money  out of your account and give it directly to offshore banks that are running the whole  show.  They're putting a police state in because they are going to get rid of all due process  and all freedom, and the cops are going to lose their pension funds, too.  When I'm anti-police state, I'm not anti-cop.  In fact, on average, cops are more awake than most people.  And the military is very awake, I found, as well. 
[02:57:30]  System giving them orders.  We have on tape all this high-def footage.  I want to put a special report together by tonight.  But it takes time to dump that down, where the police chief said, yes, you're right.  You can go in.  Very friendly.  Dallas cops all nice.  And then later, we have Dallas police on tape saying, look, we're sorry.  That was the sheriff's department under the feds.  And we've gone back and reviewed the video.  So I don't know what video you're looking at.  Quite frankly, my crew did stuff like take videos at the end or this piece or that piece 
[02:58:00]  and just throw it up because there's so many different angles, so much footage.  But I will go through it all and put a report together today or tomorrow.  It just takes a lot of time to take through all this footage.  And then I will send you a three- or four-minute compilation to see exactly what was going on.  All right.  Now, I agree with a lot of stuff you talk about.  And I think we are losing our freedoms here in the United States.  I think the powers that be that are in charge right now, I really do think they have this â€“ 
[02:58:30]  they would like it much better if the people were just quiet and would, you know, capitulate to their bidding.  Exactly.  Up until 1963.  And I don't romanticize Kennedy.  He wasn't a perfect guy.  He was a sex addict.  He took drugs.  He partied.  You know, all this other stuff.  He was a pretty serious guy, but he was a war hero.  And he wasn't a total tyrant.  And he did cut taxes by 50 percent.  He was more conservative fiscally than Ronald Reagan because he knew when you cut taxes, 
[02:59:00]  actually it boosted the economy on average and more tax receipts come in.  So I am a fan of Kennedy.  And up until the time that Kennedy was killed, the CIA generally actually tried to put better governments in  and tried to overturn dictators.  They've done some of that before.  Right.  Ever since that coup, all they do is put in dictators.  Now, why is that important?  Because if they're running America, what do they want here?  If our government sets up tyrannies worldwide now and puts even worse people in than Saddam Hussein, 
[02:59:30]  the list goes on and on, then what are they going to do here domestically?  They're going to set a police state up as well.  Yeah, yeah.  I think we've been seeing that a lot more lately.  You know, when the police have to respond to an emergency, it certainly doesn't look like the police anymore that are showing up.  It looks like, you know, paramilitary.  It looks like a troop of orcs.  Right.  Yeah.  And I'll tell you, you know, I was sitting there on my own radio slash TV show last night.  That was a Sunday show as well.  And my guys were just randomly playing clips off Ustream. 
[03:00:00]  And I went, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I mean, I've had a whole crew here this weekend of three or four people supposedly trying to grab all this.  I'm not putting my crew down, but, you know, I'm like, where's all the really hardcore stuff?  Uh-huh.  Because it doesn't look as bad with the few tapes that have got hundreds of thousands of views.  That's true.  Just wait.  Because last night I had to go to my dad's birthday, but I said, look.  Look at this.  And I was looking at the computers with all the high-def footage.  And I was like, look at that.  He's choking.  He's slamming his head in there.  So we didn't see any of that, Alex. 
[03:00:30]  We only saw the one clip with you, and it didn't look, honestly, it didn't look that bad.  Yeah, it looked like they were practicing a little crowd control.  You know, kind of pushing you back a little bit.  I don't know, but, yeah, exactly.  Here's what happened.  By the time we got a â€“ they pushed us for 200 yards.  Damn.  All the way around a building.  And by the end â€“ by the middle, we're slamming people's heads into signs for no reason.  Choking people.  All right.  And some of these guys, you know, look like they were waiting for the Dallas Cowboys front line.  I mean, they were really ramming into people, bloodying people. 
[03:01:00]  And, again, we weren't expecting this to happen.  It totally â€“ in fact, it's on the raw footage.  I saw this last night.  Like, everybody starts booing because they immediately attack on my left.  And I'm like, hey, stop booing the cops.  And then 10 seconds later, the cop says, move one time, and then starts pushing me and shoving me.  And I had two of them up against me, and one of them punched me in the stomach.  All right.  So now, where can we see this footage once it gets up tonight?  It'll be on InfoWars.com.  And I've also got an interview. 
[03:01:30]  No one has interviewed her in 10 years except one film show.  And, of course, that's Vivian Kubrick, the protege daughter of Stanley Kubrick.  Turns out she showed up, hung out with her for two days, incredibly smart, obviously.  She was a witness to what the police did.  She was actually in that whole melee.  So I'm going to be premiering that interview today or tomorrow as well at InfoWars.com,  and you guys are welcome to use that.  Well, thanks, man.  Are we ever going to find out what happened in Dallas that day, Alex Jones? 
[03:02:00]  Well, here's what I know.  E. Howard Hunt sued a newspaper that said that he was on the Grassy Knoll,  the famous CIA hitman that Mission Impossible, you know, named the main character off of.  He overthrew on record seven different governments himself in World War II.  He was a sniper in China against the Japanese.  So a real badass.  On his deathbed, he gave an audio and video confession that I got the exclusive from the sun on. 
[03:02:30]  The Gunga.  Wait, you're the only one that has the audio right now?  No, no.  You can look it up.  This is years ago.  I want to hear the audio, so go ahead.  Continue.  The point is, E. Howard Hunt sued the newspaper decades ago that said he was the commander of the team  and lost in court.  The jury found that there was evidence he was the killer.  He then apologized on his deathbed on audio, video, and in text.  Did you find that, Sam?  And said that he ran the operation for LBJ. 
[03:03:00]  Okay, so we know what happened.  I've interviewed Barr McClellan.  His son became the White House Chief of Staff or head White House spokesman, Dr. Bush.  Barr McClellan from Austin openly sat in meetings with LBJ talking about how he had that son of a bitch killed.  Wow.  Let me just make sure I got this right.  E. Howard Hunt, Sam.  Who was saying that he had him killed with LBJ?  LBJ was saying it, or the other guy was saying it, to the current president who was just going, okay? 
[03:03:30]  No, no, no, no.  I'm telling you that E. Howard Hunt, who was a CIA hit squad leader on record.  E. Howard Hunt, you know, one of the Watergate plumbers, you name it.  E. Howard Hunt, on his deathbed, admitted that he'd been there.  He got arrested as one of the tramps.  The head of the railway station was 100 yards away, saw E. Howard Hunt, identified him, and got killed two days later.  How would people know what he looks like if he's like a CIA sniper guy? 
[03:04:00]  No, no, no, no, no.  He didn't know he was E. Howard Hunt at the time.  Oh, okay, okay.  The man in the railway station identified the tramps.  They were in the police station.  He said, yeah, that's the guy with the gun.  And so they killed him.  This is all on record.  This is all on record.  Who was saying this in front of LBJ?  I had the son of a bitch killed.  Who was saying that?  It was Barr McClellan, LBJ's top lawyer for 30 years.  So he was saying it while LBJ was in the room?  No, LBJ. 
[03:04:30]  LBJ said it, and the lawyer overheard it.  Oh, LBJ said it.  Yeah.  Yes, and then now, and then, of course, Barr McClellan's son went on to become the press  secretary for George Bush.  I'm just pointing out who the McClellan family is.  Right.  Who else was in the room when Lyndon B. Johnson was saying this?  Oh, a whole bunch of people.  I interviewed his mistress, who actually had his illegitimate son, and they never challenged  it.  And payments were made to her as well.  I mean, I grew up in...  No, no, no.  Hold on.  So all these people...  Lyndon B. Johnson was saying that he was admitting that he had Kennedy killed in front of all these 
[03:05:00]  people.  Absolutely.  That's why they killed him at broad daylight at high noon, so the whole world, and all  the serious people, not the sheeple, you can tell them anything, it was...  They could have poisoned Kennedy.  They had people all around him.  They wanted to execute him in front of the Russians and in front of everybody else.  Well, then why would they go through such a...  If they wanted there to be a statement, why would they work so hard to make it look like  a lone gunman?  Well, it shows the hubris of what they did.  Listen, this is all on record.  I've even interviewed the Black Secret Service agent who was in Chicago two weeks before 
[03:05:30]  that blew the whistle, so they were unable to kill him in Chicago, they were going to  kill him in Miami, and Hunt talks about all this.  Listen, E. Howard Hunt gave a death-dead confession.  You can play the audio.  I want to get the audio.  My question is on...  I can't get off the Lyndon Johnson thing, though.  Why would the President of the United States, if he got away with it, blab it in front of  a bunch of people?  Well, listen, I live here in Austin with all of his grandchildren and cousins and everybody. 
[03:06:00]  I mean, I'm even friends with people in the Johnson family.  You know, I go up in, like, big mansions over the lake and, you know, hang out with  them and stuff.  I mean, come on, guys.  This is absolutely well-known around here.  Fair enough, but how come with Governor Connolly's, you know, who was shot and his wife could  have been killed, didn't take issue with this, especially if he was callous enough to discuss  it, apparently, at parties?  That's what I don't understand. 
[03:06:30]  Why would the President say that in front of people?  Well, listen, that's what you always do, is seize on one area that you think sounds  improbable.  Reality is improbable.  No, it's not that I seize on one area.  We're discussing something, and you're saying the President of the United States admitted  to having him killed in front of people.  So I'm saying let's really talk about that and analyze it and not use it as one thing  in a list of things.  Bar McClellan, it was national news when it came out, and the LBJ family threatened to 
[03:07:00]  sue, but then backed off.  There was national TV shows, I guess about four or five years ago, and I interviewed Bar McClellan  multiple times, it's on YouTube, the audio of the video, that he was LBJ's official lawyer  for decades.  His official lawyer said that LBJ brags all the time about killing him.  Is that clear, pervert?  Well, again, I certainly can't sue him for libel.  He's not lying.  I'm just joking. 
[03:07:30]  No, I know.  But the thing is, though...  I'm actually jealous of you, okay?  No, I know.  But the thing is, I agree with you as a lawyer, but I always have a weird thing with, like,  I just...  There's something about, if everyone's getting killed, and all these people have been silenced  and shut up, and everyone's too scared to talk, why is it that the lawyer of LBJ, who  had all this privileged information, goes out and blabs it with no penalty?  Okay, well, listen, here's the deal.  Jim Garrison, decades after it happened... 
[03:08:00]  You know who Jim Garrison is, right?  I do, yes.  Yeah, we saw the movie.  He did.  Okay.  Yes, he was a boob.  He fucked it up.  Okay, well, the point is, is he was a bad man, yes.  Anyways, the whole point is, you know, World War II hero, oh, no, I was a horrible person.  The point is...  We didn't say it's a bad...  Thank you for your service.  Thank you for your service.  Let me just get back to what I was saying.  All right, yeah.  Expanding on this, okay?  Because it's very, very important just to get this out there.  Where were we now?  I forget.  Oh, yeah, Jim Garrison.  Yeah.  Jim Garrison said the way to stay alive is to go public. 
[03:08:30]  You can put everything you know out on the table.  That's how he stayed alive.  Barr McClellan did this 40-plus years after the assassination.  They don't kill you now, generally, for speaking out, okay?  And so that's the bottom line.  I mean, here's an example.  I'm on KLBJ 590 AM and their FM here in Austin, Texas, 99.7, okay?  I've been on that station off and on over the last decade, okay?  They pick up my show. 
[03:09:00]  I've actually done my syndicated show out of there for a couple years, okay?  It was well known until the LBJ showed that in their TV stations that if you said one thing  about JFK, you would be thrown out of there and fired.  And, of course, so that's the kind of stuff we're talking about.  And you're sitting there going, well, why would his lawyers say this?  Because people are sick of the lies.  Look, you didn't respond to me.  E. Howard Hunt went on record saying it's true.  He basically was a, quote, backbencher as a backup quarterback, in his words, on the 
[03:09:30]  big event, killing JFK in Dallas.  His lawyers gone public saying, yes, indeed, LBJ openly bragged about it.  And I don't want to say any more about it, but I mean, I'll just tell you.  I'm not going to say it.  I mean, anyways, the whole point is that I have a very elderly member of my family who  actually dated one of the people that worked for LBJ or something like that.  Oh, oh, ooh. 
[03:10:00]  A little family member, so you might have gotten a little information.  Well, no.  I mean, one time I was like, right after the Barbara Cologne interview, I was sitting  around talking about LBJ's group of hitmen, because he was a total mobster.  I mean, there's like best-selling, you know, mainline books, three-volume sets, you name  it, all about how this guy from nowhere, literally the countryside outside Austin, you know, took  over Texas and then took over the country.  I mean, he had like a whole string of hitmen who were just, you know, basically killing  anybody that got in his way. 
[03:10:30]  And he liked to drink a lot at night, and it was just an absolute gangster, man.  Very cool.  I want to hear this audio.  All right, Alex.  Thank you, Alex.  Thank you.  Always a pleasure.  Have a good holiday, man.  Infowars.com.  Check it out.  You bet there's dozens of videos up there.  You guys are welcome to pour through them, but I will have everybody go through all the  videos.  And I want you guys to have an absolutely fabulous Thanksgiving coming up.  And you guys are always, always welcome to come on my show.  Would you guys like to come on my show? 
[03:11:00]  I would love to do that.  Let's do that.  Absolutely, man.  I want to see Austin, so fly us down there.  Really?  I'll fly you guys there.  You want to fly down?  Yeah.  We only go first class.  That's right.  Well, not me.  Have a good holiday, man.  Yeah, we'll figure something out.  Thanks, Alex.  Thanks, man.  Thank you later, guys.  All right, Alex Jones.  I have to leave because I have to catch a plane.  What?  What about the audio of the E. Howard Hunt deathbed confession?  I have to catch a plane because it's fallen.  I'm in shake. 
[03:11:30]  Why don't we play the deathbed confession?  Yeah.  I'll be gone.  A little bit.  We'll just hear the first little bit.  I bet it's long.  It's only four minutes.  Five minutes?  Yeah.  JimNorton.com for all my dates, if you care.  Okay.  Okay.  I heard from Frank that LBJ had designated Kornbier Jr. to undertake a larger organization  while keeping it totally secret. 
[03:12:00]  Kornbier himself was a rather favorite member of the Eastern Aristocracy.  He was a graduate of Yale University and had joined the Marine Corps during the war and  lost an eye in the Pacific fighting.  Yeah.  I think that LBJ settled on Meyer as an opportunist, Perrin like himself, Perrin, and a man who had very little left to him in life ever since JFK had taken Kornbier's wife as one of his mistresses. 
[03:12:30]  I would suggest that Kornbier welcomed the approach from LBJ, who was, after all, only the vice president at that time. 
[03:13:00]  Of course, could not number Kornbier among JFK's admirers.  I have no idea what's going on in this audio.  As for Dave Phelps.  He's just talking about the players.  Let's go.  Keep going.  I knew him pretty well at one time.  He worked for me during the Guatemala project.  He had made himself useful to the agency in Santiago, Chile, where he was an American businessman. 
[03:13:30]  In any case, his actions, whatever they were, came to the attention of the Santiago station chief.  And when his resume became known to people in the Western Hemisphere division, he was brought in to work on Guatemalan operations. 
[03:14:00]  This is like...  Perrin and Morales and...  Rambling.  People of that yoke stayed in apartment houses during preparation for the big event.  Those were the players.  He was explaining the players.  Their addresses were very subject to change.  So that where a fellow like Morales had been in one day, you're not necessarily associated with that same address. 
[03:14:30]  What happened to the groceries?  In short, it was a very mobile experience.  Let me point out at this point that if I had wanted to fictionalize what went on in Miami and elsewhere during the run-up for the big event,  I would have done so, but I don't want any unreality to tinge at this particular story or the information, I should say. 
[03:15:00]  I was a benchwarmer on it, and I had a reputation for honesty.  I think it's essential to refocus on what this information that I've been providing you...  This sounds like a meeting down the hall.  ...and you alone, by the way, consists of.  What is important in the story is that we've backtracked the chain of command up through Cornmire and laying the doings at the doorstep of LBJ. 
[03:15:30]  He, in my opinion, had an almost maniacal urge to become president.  He regarded JFK as he was, in fact, an obstacle to achieving that. 
[03:16:00]  He could have waited for JFK to finish out his term and then, undoubtedly, a second term.  So that would have put the LBJ at the head of a long list of people who were waiting for some change in the executive branch.  Uh-huh.  See, but he didn't want to wait to be president.  Wow.  That's amazing.  That explains everything.  That's going to make driving home that much harder. 
[03:16:30]  Because my eyes are just going to start shutting.  Wow.  That was amazing.  And when...  That's like most of Alex's, like, sources and his source of video and documents.  There's some vagary there.  There's some vagary there.  There's some vagary there.  But most of his source documents and video, you watch it or read it, and within one paragraph or a minute in, you're like, I just can't do this.  Right.  Well, they were very vague back then.  Very vague. 
[03:17:00]  All right.  I guess we're all tired.  Wow.  We'll see you all tomorrow.  Great stuff.  You want to say something, Anthony?  Well...  What?  What happened?  Hey, how did you sleep last night?  Did you wake up stubborn, stiff, and cranky?  If so, maybe you don't have the right pillow under your head at night like LBJ had.

If they put his big chop meat head on that MyPillow, it would have cured his big hole in his head.  I don't know how much MyPillow wants to be ad-libbing on their reed.

[03:21:30]  I'd spread your legs and bury my nose in there.  He's rutting.  He's rutting around in your drawers.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much.  This show will be available later today with Sirius XM On Demand.  After ONA Live is next.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts. 
[03:22:00]  I'm glad we got to the bottom of the JFK conspiracy today.  And that we can make room for a huge...  Right there is just fine.  A huge star.  In the world of sports and entertainment, and sports entertainment.  The Miz has arrived.  I have.  How's it going?  Good, Miz.  How are you?  I am awesome.  I knew you were here.  You know how?  How?  Our intern.  See that female intern right there?  Yes, I do.  Yo, what's up? 
[03:22:30]  She just said, I don't know who you have coming in here, but he is really good looking.  Well, you know.  I said, that must be the Miz.  That must be the Miz.  That must be me.  That's got to be.  That has to be.  But then she meets me, and she's like, well, all right, never mind.  Maybe far away was a little better.  Nah, I feel like up close I'm good, but when she starts talking to me, sometimes I'm a little  too much for people.  I think it's a little too arrogant, egotistical.  It sends a wrong message.  But it seems like you know yourself well enough.  You're not coming off as egotistical to me right now.  You're saying, I know I'm handsome.  I feel like when people first meet me, I'm sometimes too much. 
[03:23:00]  I'm too in your face.  But once you get to know me, people end up liking me.  So is that just what your default is?  Like when you meet somebody who says, yeah, you're a good looking guy, do you just start  going on about how great you are?  How great I am.  You too.  And then I tell them, yeah, I have a movie coming out tomorrow, November 26th, called  Christmas Bounty at 7 p.m.  ABC Family.  You can watch it if you want.  Why do you do that?  Well, I don't know.  You think that you would just be cool.  I think it's a nervous tick.  I think it's a nervous tick.  You think I would just play it off cool, but I don't know. 
[03:23:30]  Because at this point, I would...  Because you think I've gotten it enough to where women just throw themselves at me that  I've gotten it enough to where...  One can only assume.  Of course.  That's just you being charming again, though.  No, I would think that you've gotten to the point where you've kind of achieved the  things that you set out to do.  I feel like guys talk like that when they're kind of on their way up to do...  Well, no, I'm going to be a wrestler.  And yeah, I'm doing this reality thing right now.  But I'm going to be...  No, I'm going to be the champion.  No, I'm going to be in movies.  I feel like I'm always trying to prove myself, no matter what. 
[03:24:00]  No matter what I've done with what I've been through in WWE, whether it's WWE Championship  or main eventing WrestleMania or doing movies, I still want to prove to everyone that I  could do more.  And I could do better.  And I'm the best.  And I'm number one.  But isn't there something to having the confidence of being like, no, at this point  they know I'm the best.  My work has spoken for itself.  You don't have that.  No, I mean, I do have the confidence, I do believe, but I just think bragging is more  fun.  You just have to keep talking. 
[03:24:30]  I just have to reiterate it and my mouth just keeps moving.  And then it's funny whenever people say, you know, I try to talk about the other person,  I'll always end up talking about myself about that other person.  And your interactions with that.  How conceited am I, honestly?  Come on.  Very.  Are you taking full credit for MTV's real world ratings going down?  Have you heard that they're reformatting the show?  No, I have not heard that.  What are they doing?  Do scripted reality?  Well, I'm pretty sure they've been doing that for a few seasons.  They weren't doing that with you.  Same with me, no, I mean, when I did it back 13 years ago. 
[03:25:00]  But yeah, when I was on the real world, it was completely as real as real can be on TV.  It wasn't like they were telling you, hey, can you start this storyline with this person  and this person?  No, it was just like, just live your life and we'll film it and we'll edit it however  we feel will be the most dramatic and nice.  Yeah, I've read that now, because nobody's watching the show anymore.  No, I'm not on it.  I haven't been on it in five years.  I've been on the challenges in like five years, so I mean, I understand the ratings going down.  You take full credit for that.  But somebody told me that they're now doing it with exes. 
[03:25:30]  Like, they're taking couples who dated and broke up and they're bringing the couple in  and they're doing like whatever.  So it's not really the real world anymore.  Not at all.  I guess it's the real world with exes, but I mean, are they going to change the intro?  Yeah, I mean, this is the true story of seven strangers picked to live in a house.  It's not seven strangers anymore.  Some of whom are strangers.  Others know each other quite well.  Yeah, and they're exes.  And guess what?  They live in a house.  No, I think it's a guarantee they will definitely fight and be very beautiful people. 
[03:26:00]  But I mean, you also got to think about it.  It's been 30, what, 30 seasons of, I mean, how many shows can actually say, you know,  30 seasons of, you know, of a certain show?  You can't say that with anything, but the real world has made it.  And it has said in the test of time.  So I guess revamping it is, I guess, a good call.  You think they would just let it go, though?  Or just call something else?  You can't let it go.  You can't let it go.  I can't let things go.  You know, it's kind of a pastime.  It's run its course.  It's over now.  What about WWE?  What happens if that would happen to WWE? 
[03:26:30]  Wouldn't you throw a fit?  I would.  Wouldn't you?  Exactly.  But they changed their name.  I think there's some people that would throw a fit because, you know, they have lived through.  Yeah, but the WWE has, like, fans all over the world.  I still have fans come up to me to this day.  I've been on the show in, like, eight years.  A challenge in eight years.  And I still, every day, someone will recognize me.  And I can tell if it's a real world person or a WWE person.  People come up to you of no recollection, no sense of you being a wrestler and just know you as the guy.  They go, oh, my God, you're Mike from the real world. 
[03:27:00]  How's Coral?  And I'm like, I haven't seen Coral in ten years.  And then they're like, so what are you doing now?  Oh, I'm WWE.  Wait, didn't you want to be a wrestler on the show?  Yes.  Thirteen years ago, I wanted to be a wrestler, and I became one.  I was on pay-per-view with The Rock.  I mean, I don't know if it was a big deal.  A little bit.  To some people.  Made some good money.  Are the groupies for wrestling, I would assume the groupies for reality,  TV are probably better.  Yeah, absolutely.  I mean, it's all different, I guess you could say,  because I think the WWE fans are more passionate. 
[03:27:30]  For instance, I landed in Boston Airport yesterday morning at five in the morning,  and there was like ten people there to sign autographs,  sign their chairs, sign their programs, pictures of me, pictures of Maurice.  Like, it was my fiancÃ©, for anyone that doesn't know.  Has anybody called you?  Because I would assume there's some five o'clock in the morning moments  where you don't want to deal with a whole bunch of wrestling fans.  I'm not that guy, though.  I'm more of the person that I just remember back in the day  when my dad would take me to Cleveland Municipal Stadium to see the Indians play, 
[03:28:00]  and we would wait outside for the players to come through,  and players would just walk by,  and there was always one or two that would sign autographs.  It would make my day as a kid.  And so I always remember that kid,  and whether it's an adult asking for my autograph or a kid,  whether I'm eating or doing something that I don't want to do,  it's like, they want my autograph.  It's kind of a privilege and an honor.  You're still in that mode.  You're not jaded.  I don't think I could ever get to a mode where I don't appreciate the person. 
[03:28:30]  I mean, granted, you're going to catch me sometimes in a bad mood,  or I just got off doing something.  But most of the time, I would say 95% of the time,  I'm always very courteous to our audience,  because they're the people that pay my bills.  And do you think the reason that you're not as jaded as some other people  is because you have kind of been, every step of the way,  a lot of people have been telling you that you can't do it  or that you're shitty or whatever.  Like, you're met with criticism a lot.  So I feel like maybe the mentality of constantly trying to prove yourself 
[03:29:00]  also stops you from just being like,  yeah, whatever, man.  This is what I do.  I'm always in a constant state of making myself better  and doing better and just appreciating where I'm at.  I'm always one of those people that, whenever I'm in that ring  and I look around and I see that audience either cheering me or booing me,  it's one of those situations where I try to take a step back  and go, look at where you are.  This is incredible.  Not everyone gets to have this opportunity,  and you are lucky enough to be the person that's doing this. 
[03:29:30]  So do the best you can and try to motivate these people  to either boo you or cheer you, either way.  Speaking of the opportunities you get, let's talk about why you're here.  You mentioned it briefly, but you have a movie.  I do.  Another one.  This is not a WWE movie this time, correct?  It is.  It is.  WWE Studios, but it's also with ABC Family.  That's why.  This is an ABC Family movie.  It's going to be on the ABC Family channel tomorrow night at 7 p.m. Eastern,  and it's called Christmas Bounty.  Now, Miz, tell me what the name of your character is in this movie. 
[03:30:00]  Mikey Muscles.  Yes.  My character is Mikey Muscles.  What is Mike?  Christmas Bounty, Tuesday at 7 p.m. on ABC Family.  What exactly does Mikey?  Why are you laughing?  Why are you laughing?  What does Mikey Muscles do for a living?  He's a bounty hunter.  That seems like a great coincidence that he was born with the last name Muscles.  I know.  Well, you know, Mikey Muscles.  He's got some muscles.  It's his nickname.  Right.  That was really his last name.  It's his nickname.  You know, and then the lead character is named Tori, but her kind of nickname is Tornado. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, okay.  Because there's a lot.  I mean, Mikey Muscles, Tori.  I wasn't even going to say.  Don't you have nicknames for all your friends?  Well, yeah, but you can't say on ABC Family.  And the things that start with T after Tori that immediately came to my head are not things  that you could put in a Christmas movie.  Well, yeah, but I mean, so, yeah, it's a Christmas movie.  It's for the family, for the friends.  It's for you.  You know, you can sit there with your wife and you can bring out the popcorn.  Just share a warm moment. 
[03:31:00]  Put your nice little cozy socks on.  Maybe get a Snuggie out there.  My Miss Snuggie.  You know, share a Snuggie or your Miss Snuggie.  There you go.  Watch the movie.  Enjoy it.  You'll leave with a smile on your face.  It's something for everyone, too.  Are you self-critical?  I'm very self-critical.  I saw the screening of the movie, and I watched it with Maurice and Maurice's mother.  And in the movie, I'm actually kissing another girl.  And is this the girl?  I think the girl who's in the movie is the one who is on...  The Secret Life of an American Teenager.  The Secret Life of an American Teenager.  It's amazing that you know that. 
[03:31:30]  Well, because my wife used to watch the show all the time.  And I'd just sit there and have to watch it with her, I swear.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, you know you liked it.  The Chick wants to watch it.  She's super hot, though.  Yeah, she's very, very pretty.  The Chick that's in this movie with you.  Very pretty girl.  And very charismatic.  Always came to work with everything prepared, everything ready.  And taught me a lot.  And she's really good.  But so you had to watch it with your fiancÃ© and your fiancÃ©'s mom.  Yes.  And with Francia there as well.  And you've never done a storyline where you've had to make out with women on TV. 
[03:32:00]  No, no.  This is the first time.  She kind of popped my cherry for this.  Yeah.  I'll bet she did.  Oh, yeah.  Well, so yeah.  Watching me make out with another girl with my fiancÃ© and her mother there, I was like,  oh, man, this is kind of nerve-wracking.  Because you don't know what to expect.  You don't know what's going to happen.  I know Maurice is a very cool chick and that kind of stuff.  But the best part is, at the second part, I basically told her I had a kissing scene.  She was like, oh, okay, no problem.  And then when it was done, she was like, that's it? 
[03:32:30]  I'm like, what did you want?  Fifty Shades of Grey?  I mean, Jesus.  And you're like, no, it was good.  I mean, come on.  You know what I mean?  It's like, that's it?  And I'm like, yes, that's...  She didn't even...  That's the worst.  Yeah.  Like, you'd rather her be pissed than not care.  Yeah, I was thinking, man, you know, she's going to be angry, like, you know...  Wait until she sees the passion that I have.  Yeah, the passion, like, that's how great of an actor I am.  Yeah.  Now, I guess that's the first time that you've seen yourself...  Have you ever made any whole movies?  No.  That must be the first time that you've seen yourself kiss, or is it not?  First time I've seen myself... 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, on camera.  Is that weird?  Because I would have...  I've never...  I've never looked at myself in the mirror making out with a chick.  I'm sorry.  Maybe you've done that.  Maybe you've done that.  I don't have time.  I haven't.  However, I have thought many times about how horrific I must look doing anything sexually.  Like, it's not something that I want to see.  I angle all mirrors in the bedroom.  Well, I work out.  So, I mean, you know, it wouldn't be that bad.  It wouldn't be that bad.  I mean, I wouldn't mind, you know, looking in a mirror, checking out my butt at the, you know,  at the right moment.  Patrick Bateman in American Psycho, just flexing for the mirror. 
[03:33:30]  Just flexing, just showing it off.  Not even paying attention to the girls you're with.  Yeah, taking pictures of myself, bam.  It's all about the Miz.  What did you think when you saw yourself, like, making out?  I was like, I'm pretty good.  Jesus Christ.  And I imagine she thought the same thing.  Where does it come in?  I think now that Francia has kissed me, she will basically wish that she could have a  guy as smooth and as good of a kisser as me.  The sad part is, she will never have a better kisser than the one she had in a movie. 
[03:34:00]  How can you be aware that this is why people don't like you?  I know, right?  You just keep doing it.  What do you don't like?  I can't help it.  What don't you like about yourself?  What's something you do that you're bad at, that you wish you could be better at?  There is everything.  I mean, I wish I was better at WWE.  I wish I was better at...  So you will watch a match and be like, oh.  Oh, my God.  That was the shits.  Every, every, I think, I've never seen, you know, a match that I didn't say, I need to  do this better.  I need to do this better.  This could be better. 
[03:34:30]  I mean, even in movies, I nitpick everything.  Because I think you look at yourself and you just see everything.  Things that people normally don't see.  Like, I ask my dad.  Every Monday, I'll call my dad and go, what'd you think?  And he'll say stuff completely different than what I thought people noticed.  And my dad's more like, yeah, why don't you do any stuff off the top rope?  I'm like, well, dad, you know what?  Your genetics didn't allow me to have that high-flying ability, okay?  That is your fault.  Yeah. 
[03:35:00]  Not my fault.  You should be better.  Thanks, dad.  I appreciate it, you know?  But you won't be, but you're not public about that stuff.  Like, you'll sit there nitpicking in your own head, but none of that comes out.  You're just like, when you're talking out loud to people, it's always the good stuff.  Because perception.  It's all about perception and what people see you as.  So if you tell them you're the best, how do they know you're not?  Eventually, they'll believe you.  Eventually, yeah.  Eventually, they'll believe you.  If you stick around long enough.  If I tell you Christmas Bounty is the best movie you'll ever see in your entire life,  guess what?  If you don't watch it, you don't know. 
[03:35:30]  Right.  And I can only assume.  I guess you're going to have to watch it and then either say yes or no on social media.  That's some weird Jedi shit.  Right.  And it obviously works, because you were talking about your fiancee, Maryse, a minute ago.  It's The Miz in here.  And you're talking about Maryse, who used to be a female wrestler for WWE.  Sure.  And she is among the absolute hottest women that have ever been in that company.  No doubt about it.  You would agree with that.  I would say in the world.  In the world.  She's ridiculous.  I'm a very, very lucky person.  Like, she now, what she does, I'm sure she does other things, but as far as being in 
[03:36:00]  public, she goes state to state and goes to these autograph conventions, and you should  see the way that these fans just get so lathered up.  How do you know?  How do you know?  I'm everywhere, Miz.  You know that by now.  You're one of those guys.  Yeah, I'm just facing what you're saying.  Oh, Maryse, how much for a photo?  How much for a photo?  Will you sign it up?  I'll get you one.  I'll get you one for free.  Okay.  Thank you.  I'm glad we have that connection.  But, you started dating her when she was working in the company?  Yeah.  She actually tried out for the diva search, and I was the host slash one of the people 
[03:36:30]  that got to help pick with the divas, which ones were.  And I didn't really, she didn't even speak English at the time.  Right.  She spoke French because she's from Montreal.  And that accent only makes it better.  Oh, it was great.  I was like, so what's your name?  Huh?  And it's like, what is your name?  What is your name?  Right.  What is?  Okay.  You know, tell us a little about yourself.  Huh?  Okay, you're beautiful.  You go to the next round.  Yeah, you're past.  And then finally, finally, I was like, listen, can you cut a promo in French? 
[03:37:00]  She's like, promo?  Sure.  Well, she cut this amazing promo in French.  I was like, she's in.  Yeah.  So after a year later, we ended up dating.  And it's crazy, too, because last time I saw you, you two were together, and I was talking  to both of you.  And she's all on this Ms. Bandwagon.  You have her convinced that you're awesome, too.  What do you mean convinced?  You have her convinced people that you are the greatest thing.  Well, I think she thinks that.  I believe she does, too.  Well, my fiancÃ© thinks I'm great.  Doesn't your wife think you're great, or is she on the, like, I hate him, Bandwagon?  I wish you would stay at the radio show all day long so I could just be by myself and 
[03:37:30]  not hear you.  I think that's what we have in common.  There's a lot of people that hate both of us, but we both have women that are way more  attractive than us that, for whatever reason, think we're fantastic.  Yeah.  Was there a lot of jealousy in the locker room when you started claiming Maurice as your own?  No, we knew.  I actually didn't tell anyone for the first, like, three years that we were dating because  we didn't want that kind of awkward kind of weirdness that you get when you're in the  workplace and you have a relationship that tends to get messy, so we were just going to 
[03:38:00]  hide it from everybody, and we did it for about three years.  I would assume a lot of the wrestlers would hit on her, though.  Yeah.  I always think of that as a compliment.  Like, when a lot of people get jealous, I'm more of a person that, if you're not, if  a person isn't hitting on my fiancÃ©, then I'm like, I mean, they should.  Right.  They should hit on my fiancÃ© because she's beautiful, she has a great personality, she's  a wonderful person.  Why wouldn't someone want to hit on her? 
[03:38:30]  That's more my mentality.  And there's nobody there that you're threatened by that could be like, oh, let me keep this  dude away from her.  If, no, because if I do that, then I'll always wonder if I was really the one.  You know, I always, and if she thinks that there's someone better than me, go for it.  Because guess what?  If, you know, then you're always going to wonder.  And I'd rather her not wonder, I'd rather her know.  And I feel like she knows.  You've got to let the bird fly, and if it comes back to you, then it was meant to be.  Is that right?  Thank you.  Is that what you're telling me?  Very philosophical of you. 
[03:39:00]  You're a romantic guy.  I am a romantic.  Hopeless.  Romantic.  You're back to being a bad guy in wrestling.  That's what people say.  I don't think so.  Well, you turned on your tag team partner the other week.  That's one of the most dastardly things I could think of.  I know.  So dastardly, right?  I dropped off the apron when a guy goes to tag me in.  That is so horrible.  He was counting on you.  Let's put it this way.  Kofi Kingston wants a spotlight.  The Miz wants a spotlight.  We are not in the main event right now.  No.  And we get it.  But the fact is, we need to start making noise.  We need to start doing things that people aren't used to seeing. 
[03:39:30]  And so they talk about it.  And what happened?  I created people talking on social media, on Twitter, on Facebook, YouTube, you name  it.  People were talking about, oh, Miz is turning heel.  Miz is a bad guy.  That's how they sound, too.  Exactly.  But then we went to Survivor Series last night.  We had a great match.  Shaked hands.  And then at the end of the match, I win.  Shook hands.  Thank you.  Shook hands.  Thank you for your English major there.  And then at the end of the match, I won.  I go to shake his hand again. 
[03:40:00]  I could say shake that time.  That time shake.  And yes, I go to shake his hand, and he slaps me in the face.  Yeah, but he's mad at you.  See, the thing is...  Why is he mad at me?  You got people talking, but it was at the expense of your tag team partner.  This is an evil thing to do.  Imagine if E-Rock's in there, and he's at the board, and I...  Well, I do.  I go out of my way to make him look bad, to help myself shine.  Now, I'm shining, but everybody's like, what a dick Sam is.  Yeah, I understand, but...  And if you're a dick in wrestling, that makes you a bad guy. 
[03:40:30]  But then he smacks you, does that make him a bad guy?  No.  Does that make you a bad guy if you go to shake his hand?  How about this?  Kofi would have never had him match at Survivor Series if it wasn't for me.  Right.  So thank you.  He should be thanking me for his paycheck that he's got.  As a matter of fact, he should give me his paycheck that he's going to get from Survivor Series,  because I'm the reason that he has a match.  So, you're welcome.  That's a bad guy thing to say.  Is that a bad guy?  How is that bad?  You're asking for his money.  By the way, this entire interview, you've called me a bad guy.  You are a bad guy.  From the beginning, all the way from the middle to the end, you've basically been telling 
[03:41:00]  me I'm cocky, I'm arrogant, and you've been agreeing with me, and I agree with it.  I said you're very good looking, too.  Thank you.  Well, at least there's something good about this.  Exactly.  Now, you're more comfortable being a bad guy, I would assume?  You know, I never consider myself a bad guy.  It fits your personality a little better.  Is that another thing?  You're just zinging me all over the place, aren't you?  It fits me so much more.  Like, we look at you and we think, oh, he's so good.  Angelic.  He's such a good guy.  But do you feel like that's more just being you and it's easier?  I feel like being me is a lot easier.  I can put on The Miz very, very easily. 
[03:41:30]  And it's just a natural...  Yeah, I've been noticing you floating in and out of it in here.  Well, yeah, I float in and out a lot.  But yeah, it's one of those situations where when I was, quote unquote, a good guy, it was  kind of a situation where I was the good guy that kept on getting beat down and never had  any retaliation.  Right.  As a bad guy, when you're getting beat down, my retaliation is all I have to do is talk.  And I can get everyone to believe in all my nonsense.  Right, I guess because when you're a good guy, you get beat down and you still can't 
[03:42:00]  say anything that's that nasty about the guy there.  Yeah, you can if you have edge as a...  Like, if you look at the greats of all time, Stone Cold Steve Austin, you look at The Rock.  You know, when they would be heel, when they would be babyface, it was just a slight tweak.  They were still the same person at the core, but you just tweak it a little bit.  And so, and they did great at it.  So I think it takes some time to get people used to whether they're cheering you or booing  you.  Let me ask you.  We were talking about you being on pay-per-view with The Rock a couple years ago, which was 
[03:42:30]  obviously the biggest moment of your career, I would think.  Or WrestleMania, I would say.  That's what I meant when you were, when he rock-bottomed you at WrestleMania.  Sure.  Right.  I'm glad that you make that.  We're on the same page.  That's the most memorable moment, even though I can't remember it because I was concussed.  He was your hero, though, at one point, right?  Yeah, he was the reason I wanted to be a WWE superstar.  So, going against him at...  Did he really give you a concussion?  No, he didn't.  Or was that earlier?  That was earlier.  I got tackled off of a stage onto the concrete, and my head hit the concrete. 
[03:43:00]  And yeah, and then I still went on to win that match.  Do you know immediately when you're concussed?  I don't remember any of it.  Like, I had to watch it back, and I look at myself and go, oh my god, I can't believe  I got through that entire match.  So how much memory did you lose?  I don't remember that entire match.  Like, my most memorable moment...  Do you remember, like, the rest of the night?  What's supposed to happen as your most memorable moment, I should remember, and I don't remember  it.  Like, main eventing WrestleMania and holding that WWE championship up, winning in the main 
[03:43:30]  event as a bad guy, quote-unquote bad guy, like, that doesn't happen.  That's not supposed to happen, especially to a reality star.  I was on the real world.  That's not supposed to happen to me.  Especially when you're against the biggest good guy in the company.  Exactly.  And I don't remember it because I was concussed, and do I remember anything afterwards?  No.  And here's the best part that I think, to tell you a little bit about my dad.  So my parents come backstage, and now I don't remember this, or I don't remember anything.  They basically fill me in the next day of what happened.  So my parents come backstage, my mom is backstage with me, I guess, in the trainer's room, and 
[03:44:00]  my mom said my dad left.  And she thought that he just couldn't see me, you know, asking questions like that.  But my dad comes up to me the next day and goes, look at all these pictures I got.  I got a picture with The Rock.  I got a picture with John Cena.  Like, I won't let my dad backstage because he asked everyone for pictures.  And I'm like, Dad, please don't annoy people while they're trying to do it.  So he found it as an opportunity, when I was concussed, when I was hurt, when I was injured,  to find an opportunity to get the pictures then because he's backstage. 
[03:44:30]  Who cares about his kid, his little boy, who he grew up, you know, feeding and nurturing  and doing all the following stuff.  Mike's not going to remember anyway.  He doesn't remember anyway.  He's like, you were asking the same question over and over again.  It was a little annoying, to be completely honest with you.  I thought he just couldn't stand the sight of his baby boy doing that.  You bored him.  Yeah, I bored him.  Thanks, Dad.  Appreciate it.  Is that scary when you realize that you wake up the next morning and you're like, how did  WrestleMania end that I was in? 
[03:45:00]  It's completely scary.  And, you know, I guess we have a bunch of doctors that come in now that we have impact  tests.  We have a bunch of things that WWE does for us, for concussions, because they are such  a huge, huge thing that's happening right now.  Not just in WWE, but in NFL as well.  You know, we're very, very careful with them.  And so whenever you have a concussion, I guess one of the symptoms is depression.  And I became immediately, like, really depressed.  Like, I didn't do well.  I hated everything. 
[03:45:30]  I hate everything about me.  For how long?  My fiance, it was like the whole week.  It was just nonstop.  And I was like, I don't know what's wrong with me.  Why am I feeling this way?  Especially coming off that WrestleMania high that you would think.  You would think I would be, like, in the greatest of moods, but I thought, like, the match was  horrible.  I was horrible.  You know, I'm horrible.  I can't do this.  I can't do that.  And I'm talking as the WWE champion.  Yeah.  You know, I'm the guy.  And the next night, I'm talking on a microphone with Stone Cold Steve Austin. 
[03:46:00]  You know, one of my idols growing up.  And we literally go in a back and forth.  And I get to stand tall with Stone Cold Steve Austin.  It's pretty incredible.  But I was, after that, I was depressed.  The whole week, I was just depressed.  It took about a week and a half to get fully back to normal, if you will.  Being in the ring, like, the doctors were all very helpful.  So it takes a toll.  Does it shake you up as a performer when that happens?  Like, do you like, I don't want to take any more bumps. 
[03:46:30]  I'm not going out of the concrete again.  That was kind of my first major, major injury.  I've been very, very fortunate in the WWE that I haven't broken or torn anything, knock  on wood.  But that was my first, like, taste of, like, wow.  Like, that's serious.  Like, when you don't remember anything, it's kind of...  Do you remember hitting the concrete?  No.  So you don't even know what it was like to just hear the concrete on the back of your head?  I got to feel what it was like the next day when I watched it in slow motion.  That was definitely a sight to see. 
[03:47:00]  Ah, and was that...  And really, the concussion thing has only become something that people are aware of within  the last few years.  Yeah.  I mean, you're lucky that something like that didn't happen 10 years ago.  Exactly.  When it was like, okay, you know, you got a concussion, you shake it off, and you're back  in, you know, 24 hours.  Throw some dirt on it and get back in there, kid.  Yeah, yeah.  Walk it off.  Shake it.  Shake it.  Yeah, there's nothing wrong with you.  Look at you.  You look fine.  It's a bruise.  Yeah, it's a bruise.  Relax.  Man.  So that's when you're the main event.  And then after that, you kind of drift out of the main event. 
[03:47:30]  And like you said, you're now with Kofi Kingston.  Neither of you guys are the main event.  When you're out of the world title scene, does that shake your confidence as a performer?  Like, are you like, oh, maybe that was a fluke.  Am I not good enough to do this?  In WWE, you go ups and downs.  Every superstar goes through it.  And whether you're the top guy or the bottom guy, every superstar goes up and they go down.  And it's your job to be captivating enough to get back to that top spot.  And that's what I've been working for since then.  And not only that, but it's like I have so many other things that I'm doing for WWE. 
[03:48:00]  Whether it's media promotions or it's doing the Marine 3 Homefront, a movie from WWE Studios,  or the Christmas Bounty, which comes out tomorrow.  Or it's main event, doing commentary.  You know, WWE gives me plenty of platforms, hosting Miz TV on a show.  You know, it's pretty incredible the things that I've gotten to do.  And so you look at everything and you go, how can I make this better?  And that's just the kind of the way that I'm going right now.  It's like, how can I make this better? 
[03:48:30]  How can I get back to that main event, those main event storylines?  And it's just getting better and doing better and doing the best you can with what you're given.  So it seems like you're the type of guy who just wants to do everything.  Like, okay, well, I don't have a great match this week.  Let me do a Miz TV segment.  Let me commentate on that.  Let me...  Is the reason that you're given that many opportunities to do it,  is it just because they believe in you?  Or are there not that many guys like you that want to do everything?  I think a little bit of both.  I think they believe in that I can do whatever they need me to do.  Like, one time I remember Stephanie calling me the utility player. 
[03:49:00]  And I was like, is that a bad thing?  Because usually utility players last the longest, in my opinion.  Right.  And so if you call me utility player, I am a person that can do a main event WWE match.  I can go on commentary and do that.  I can host a TV show.  I can go on any kind of media network and be fine.  I don't think everyone can do that.  And I'm not...  This isn't me boasting and bragging, but it's kind of the truth.  It's like not everyone in the WWE can do what I do. 
[03:49:30]  So I think they do believe in me.  And I'm fortunate for that.  Do you like when storylines start blending into reality?  Like a few weeks ago, you were just talking about Stephanie and Triple H.  And these are the people that are legitimately in charge of the company.  Along with Vince McMahon.  Behind the scenes, storylines aside, these are the actual bosses.  And, you know, they bring you into the ring.  And they're kind of talking about how shitty you are.  And they're bringing up stuff that is legitimate things.  You know what I mean?  It's not necessarily strictly storyline.  Do you sit there going like, Jesus, guys, relax a little with that stuff? 
[03:50:00]  Or do you like that it starts to bleed?  I like it.  I love drama.  I love reality.  I come from the real world.  I mean, come on.  So, I mean, I enjoy when people...  Like, I will sometimes go, listen, talk about whatever you want to talk about.  With me, I'm the WWE superstar that if someone wants to come at me, if I have a microphone,  I'm going to come right back at you.  So, come at me.  Come with your best stuff.  Because guess what? 
[03:50:30]  It's only going to make us better and make the audience more captivated.  Who, when you're going shot for shot in the ring with...  Because most of it's, I'm assuming, scripted.  But a lot of times when you're in the ring and you're on a microphone, you're in front of a live audience,  you can easily go off script and just start going back and forth.  Who is somebody that you don't necessarily want to do that with?  Like, who's good at it?  Who's really good at it?  CM Punk's very, very good.  Paul Heyman is at his top of the game.  John Cena's really good.  The guys you would think are really good are really good. 
[03:51:00]  So, when you see on paper, you're like, okay, Miz and CM Punk have this thing in the ring together  where they're going...  I know he's...  Where they're talking.  Are you going, oh, fuck.  No, I'm going, this is going to be awesome.  This is going to be amazing because he's going to make me better.  And I'm hopefully going to make him better because of the things that we say.  Like, I have an improv background.  Like, I used to do improv Olympics.  So, I know how to handle myself in a ring and with whatever you give me. 
[03:51:30]  Whatever you give me, I'm going to shoot right back.  I'm going to try a phone call.  Let's see what happens.  Let's do it.  John in Georgia, you're on with the Miz.  Hi, Miz.  I just wanted to say, I was live at WrestleMania 27 and your promo for that was probably one  of the best since Rock vs. Austin with Limp Bizkit.  I just wanted to say, as far as you being WWE champion, do you ever see yourself, do you  see the company ever giving you that gold ring again?  Absolutely.  It's a belt, by the way. 
[03:52:00]  They do a belt, not a ring.  You could buy a belt at Target.  But, yeah, to answer your question, of course, I wouldn't be in the WWE if I don't think  I could be a World Heavyweight Champion or a WWE Champion again.  You know, it just takes that one moment sometimes.  Sometimes it takes one moment.  Sometimes it takes a year of building to that moment.  But, like you said, with that promo that they did, that vignette they did for WrestleMania  27, it was pretty incredible.  It told my entire life story and how hard I worked and how hard I fought to get to that 
[03:52:30]  spot.  And now it just means that when you get that spot, you have to fight even harder to keep  that spot.  And when you start going down and down and down, you have to work your way back up, back  up.  And it just takes time.  And sometimes it just takes one moment.  I mean, you look at Big Show right now.  Big Show is the top storyline right now.  He's had his ups and downs in the WWE.  And that's just what happens.  It happens to most, like 99% of the superstars it happens to.  When you see new guys coming in and kind of being pushed straight to the top past you, 
[03:53:00]  and you're like, this guy just got here.  There's no, like, oh boy, my luster's starting to wear off.  The new kid's in town.  No, I don't think so.  I think if there's a person that's going to help this product, help WWE get more ratings,  then guess what?  Good.  Because if there's more ratings, there's more people that get to watch me.  Right.  And hopefully you'll be able to...  There I go.  Bringing it right back to me again.  And you'll want the people to see the Miz.  Exactly.  Because I feel like if they're going to bring this guy up and they're going to watch him,  they're going to stay to watch me.  The movie, I should mention again, is Christmas Bounty.  Are you going to watch it? 
[03:53:30]  Of course I am.  Of course.  I'm a Miz fit.  That's what I'm talking about.  Not a Miz steak.  No.  So, Tuesday, tomorrow, 7 p.m. Eastern, on ABC Family, Miz plays Mikey Muscles.  Of course.  I do.  Why do you keep laughing at that, by the way?  Listen, if you like romance, if you like action, if you like drama, if you like alliteration,  it's a little bit for everything.  A little bit for everyone.  There's something for you, something for your wife, something for the kids, something for  everybody.  And you know where else I'll be tonight?  Are you going to be at Nassau?  Nassau Coliseum.  Of course I will.  Michael Strahan's hosting that bad boy. 
[03:54:00]  That's going to be huge.  Raw.  It should be very interesting.  It's tonight at the Nassau Coliseum with Michael Strahan hosting.  What are you doing tonight?  I don't know.  You know, we never know what's going on until we get there.  And then maybe an hour before, I'll probably figure out what I'm doing.  How long does it take you to be okay with that?  I would assume at the beginning, that is a very stressful thing.  It's stressful even to this day.  It is.  But it's one of those things where you just laugh it off and go, you know what?  I'm going to do the best I can and entertain this audience.  You told me last time we were talking, you were, well, no, a few times ago, but we've  talked many, many times.  Yes.  You were talking about how tough it was for you when you first got there. 
[03:54:30]  In terms of, you had some locker room hazing going on.  You were kicked out of the locker room.  I heard a story, I think I was listening to Colt Cabana's podcast, where you had to...  You listen to everything, man.  I'm all over the place.  You're all over.  Where you had to pee.  You were kicked out of the locker room.  Yes.  Because you ate chicken over someone's back.  Yes.  You had to go to the bathroom.  The wrestlers would not let you in the locker room.  You had to go to the arena bathroom, where the audience pisses, and piss real quick before 
[03:55:00]  your match.  Yes.  Now, I have...  Do you have any idea what it's like when you're using the urinal, and a kid goes, hey, I think  that's the Miz, to his friend, and it's like, I'm basically using the restroom, and I don't  know how to react.  I'm like, hey, kids, how are you?  And you're like, no, I'm not the Miz.  I just happen to be wearing ridiculous glitter shorts.  Yes.  That's exactly what I was wearing.  Don't worry about that.  But what I was wondering was, with the Richie Incognito thing happening right now, and all  this talk about locker room hazing and NFL bullying, what do you think of it?  Are you sitting there going, dude, I dealt with that, and everything's fine now, or... 
[03:55:30]  I think everyone's different, and everyone reacts to bullying different.  I was a person that I said, you know what, I'm going to prove these people wrong.  This is the motivation that I'm going to use to get myself to the top.  But I do believe that sometimes bullying is too much.  That's why WWE has an anti-bullying campaign called Be A Star, where we go to schools, whether  it's elementary, middle, or high school, all over the world.  I've been to Australia.  I've been to Germany.  I've been to Abu Dhabi, speaking to schools all over the land, just promoting anti-bullying 
[03:56:00]  campaigns, because it's...  A kid shouldn't be scared to go to school.  Yeah.  And some people are like, oh, well, you know, it makes them better, it makes them that.  Some kids it doesn't, you know?  And I'd rather risk the fact that those kids, that they're having a hard time, I'd rather  them be able to know how to deal with a bully.  And to all of us that got bullied in high school and survived, we didn't have to get bullied 
[03:56:30]  over Facebook and Twitter and have to follow us home.  It's brutal, man.  It's brutal now for kids, like...  It's brutal for me!  It's a WWE superstar!  Do you have any idea what it's like being a WWE superstar with Twitter fans, with faceless  people going, you suck!  Like, you don't know what I go through!  How do you know if I suck?  Just because you have an opinion!  Keep it to yourself!  You go home and you're like, oh, I think that was great!  And you pull up your Twitter, I'll bet the fans are all talking, you suck, Miz!  No, no, and you know what the funny part is?  There's a hundred, Miz, you're the best, you're so great, oh my god, that was such an amazing 
[03:57:00]  match!  And then it's like, the only reason it was a good match is because Kofi was in it!  It's like, you know, that's the one guy that ruins my entire day!  Thank you for that!  You really needed to do that!  Does that make you feel better about yourself, honestly?  No, it probably doesn't!  No wonder you turned on Kofi!  I know!  Yeah, I just wonder with the bullying thing, when it gets to...  I think by the time you're an adult, and you're a pro athlete, and you're in a locker  room, that's a little more where you...  It's a little easier to survive in that arena than it is, you know, dealing with the kids  who get bullied in school. 
[03:57:30]  Because the kids who get bullied in school, it's horrible.  Sure, I'm a grown adult, like I kind of know how to handle myself now, but the locker room  is completely different than it used to be.  Now everyone is striving to make the best product possible for our WWE Universe.  Right, so that's good.  Let's go to one more question.  Paul in Pennsylvania.  Sam Roberts, how's it going?  Good, but why don't you ask the Miz?  Miz, how's it going this morning?  I am awesome.  I get to sit here and hang out with Sam.  See?  I'm a wrestler in training at the Backbreakers Training Center. 
[03:58:00]  I just wanted to know, what's the biggest obstacle when starting?  I'm just a couple months in.  Biggest obstacle is sticking with it.  The best advice I ever got was from Billy Kidman.  I saw him at a Playboy party at the Playboy Mansion, because Tori Wilson was having her  cover shoot, and it was before I was in the WWE, and I was just on the real world.  And I can get into Playboy parties, so I was like, oh man, Tori Wilson's going to be there.  Maybe I can meet some of the wrestlers, and hopefully they can give me some advice.  Saw Billy Kidman, and his advice still sticks with me to this day.  Stick with it, because too many times, I've seen so many people come in and start training, 
[03:58:30]  and just, it got too hard.  There was so many sacrifices that they had to make, whether it was your job, whether it  was traveling, whether it was your wife or your companion.  There's so many obstacles that will basically take you away from wrestling, but if you truly  believe that you can do it, sticking with it is my best advice for you.  I've been doing DDP yoga for a week now, so I know something about sticking with it.  There you go.  Yes.  Miz.  You look great, by the way.  Thank you.  It's been really working for you. 
[03:59:00]  It's transforming.  I also want to tell you, you know about Steven Singer, Miz?  Steven Singer?  Yeah.  Oh, I know Steven Singer.  I hate Steven Singer.  Yeah, a lot.  I hate Steven Singer.  A lot of people hate Steven Singer.  You know, Miz, you've got to get the girl in your life, Maurice, a great gift for the  holiday season, am I right?  What would I get her?  Like, are there any rose-type things with, like, gold on it and stuff?  No roses.  Okay, no roses?  Maybe a ring?  He's got a brand new, Steven does, a brand new collection of colored diamonds.  Get out of here.  Starting at only $249. 
[03:59:30]  That's a steal.  It's a steal.  Diamonds last forever, bro.  That's right.  You can choose from sky blue diamonds, green diamonds, yellow diamonds, black diamonds,  and more.  Wow.  No matter which color or size you pick, you're going to come out the hero.  You have to get the woman in your life a gift, and you want it to be a great gift.  The more you procrastinate in buying her her holiday present, the guiltier you're going  to feel.  The guiltier you feel, the bigger the present you're going to buy.  You don't want to do that.  You know, Sam, sometimes I hate getting gifts and receiving gifts because you get that,  oh, well, you know, this is nice. 
[04:00:00]  This is good.  It's like, do you really like it?  No, no, I really love it.  And you know they don't really like it.  Right.  I think this is a gift that they're really going to like.  And you don't have to give them that whole, do you really like it?  Honestly, honestly, do you really like it?  You know they're going to like it with their eyes wide apart, basically saying, oh my god,  I can't believe you got me a diamond.  Yeah, you'll see it in their face.  A colorful one.  The sky blue diamond circle necklace, the sunshine yellow diamond circle necklace starts  at $249.  You can see it all right now online at IHStevenSinger.com. 
[04:00:30]  Fast and free shipping.  So take my advice.  Take the Miz's advice.  Get the woman in your life a great gift.  Steven Singer Jewelers, the other corner of 8th and Walnut, 1-888-IHATE-STEVENSinger  or online at IHATE-STEVENSinger.com.  Miz, if you've proven nothing else today is that you really can go with whatever.  Whatever, man.  Whatever you'd get thrown at.  I know Steven Singer.  I get it.  On the other corner, you know.  On 8th and Walnut.  I like it.  Well, everybody check out the Miz's movie, Christmas Bounty, tomorrow, Tuesday, 7 p.m. 
[04:01:00]  on ABC Family.  I've heard it's going to be even better than the Hulk Hogan vehicle, Santa with Muscles.  I hope so.  I would pray to God that it's better than that.  It couldn't possibly be worse.  I think it's going to be better than No Holds Barred.  I think so.  And I think it's going to be the best one ever.  It's going to be better than The Call in WWE Studios.  It's going to be better than The Marine 3 Homefront, Marine 2, Marine 1.  You're going overboard.  It's going to be better than all of them.  You're talking yourself up again.  It's going to be better than Christmas Vacation.  It's going to be better than A Christmas Story.  It's going to be better than Elf.  It's going to be the best Christmas movie ever, and you're going to watch it again and 
[04:01:30]  again and again on all 25 days of Christmas.  And Raw is on tonight, and it's live at the Nassau Coliseum.  I will be there, Miz.  I will see you there.  Excellent.  You'll be cheering me or booing me?  I always cheer you.  There you go.  That's what I'm talking about.  Because everybody else is booing you, so I've got to be contrarian.  Thanks for your support.  No, I've got to be contrarian.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez are coming up next.  Thank you, Miz.  Thanks, bud.  Goodbye.  The O.P. and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.
