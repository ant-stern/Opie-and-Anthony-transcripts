<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast detailed the 2006 (or a later year, as a 4th annual event is referenced) "Homeless Shopping Spree" at the Short Hills Mall in New Jersey.  The broadcast began with E-Rock and Sam Roberts recounting the planning and execution of the event, hampered by a Reverend Al Sharpton-led protest march that caused significant traffic delays in Manhattan.  This resulted in difficulties locating several recurring "homeless friends" of the show, including Papa Rock, Blue (deceased), Half a Hulk Face, Slow Motion, Grey Wolf, and Rich Voss, as well as a new participant, Homeless Fez from the Ron and Fez show, and several other unnamed individuals.  Anthony, in particular, expressed extreme anger and used strong profanity regarding the march and Sharpton.

The show then transitioned to a live broadcast from the studio as a bus carrying the gathered homeless participants journeyed to the Short Hills Mall.  Numerous callers reported massive crowds, estimated to exceed two thousand people, gathered at the mall awaiting the bus.  Listeners provided video and pictures via Paltalk.  The bus journey was extensively documented, with updates from individuals on board, including Rich Voss, who performed stand-up comedy.  Reports detailed heavy traffic, the Lincoln Tunnel crossing (accompanied by humorous commentary about the smell and behavior of the passengers), spotty communication, and anecdotes about various passengers, including Papa Rock and Grey Wolf, whose original song, "Shelter Me," was played.  Grey Wolf's song and a later song, "Homeless for the Holidays," recorded by the participants, were both played on the broadcast.

Upon arrival, the disembarking of the participants was described as chaotic and exciting, met with cheers from the massive crowd.  The show then shifted to relaying events at the mall, focusing on the overwhelming crowds and the homeless individuals' shopping sprees.  Multiple on-site reporters (Fez, Danny, Rich Voss, Than, Kenny, Roland, Steve, Sam, and others) provided updates, detailing purchases ranging from practical items to more extravagant choices.  Several stores temporarily closed due to the overwhelming number of people.  There were numerous humorous anecdotes, including a homeless man repeatedly trying on and returning shoes, and the difficulties navigating the crowds.  A major portion of the broadcast focused on an attempt to get a photo of "Half a Hulk Face" with Santa Claus, which involved negotiations with mall staff and the eventual closure of mall entrances by security and police. A caller expressed significant displeasure with the event, leading to a heated exchange with the hosts.  The strong smell emanating from the participants was repeatedly referenced throughout the broadcast.

The show's live broadcast from the mall involved multiple cameras and phone calls, suffering from numerous technical difficulties and frequent audio problems.  Big Red, a staff member, fell over at some point.  There were reports of confrontations at various stores, including the Gap.  Mall employees and some shoppers expressed discontent.  The broadcast concluded with the homeless individuals boarding the bus back to New York City, along with farewell messages and promises to post photos and videos online.  Throughout the broadcast, numerous callers provided updates and commentary on both the positive and negative reactions of mall patrons.  The entire broadcast featured frequent use of explicit language and profanity by the hosts, callers, and participants.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show, my name is E-Rock and joining me as always  Prime Time, Sam Roberts  That's right, and the Opie and Anthony show may be on vacation, but if there's one thing that E-Rock and I do not do 
[00:00:30]  It's vacation  Because they don't give us enough days  Well, I do it because I have a strong work ethic  I do it because I ran out of vacation days  You do like your vacation days  I didn't take every Monday off  That was Steve, but again, this is not a place for your personal grievances  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show  What we're going to be doing here is replaying the 2006 homeless shopping spree  Oh, yes 
[00:01:00]  This was a big one  Yeah, the homeless shopping spree to me is the greatest thing in all of radio ever  Ever  Ever  It's, uh, we gather up all our homeless friends that we meet throughout the year  We give them each 200 bucks, send them to the mall during Christmas season  All the fans show up, they contribute money  It's a really joyous thing  We take over the entire mall, the homeless people get to go away with some goodies  And everybody walks away with a smile on their face  Except for the dopes who are doing their Christmas shopping at the mall 
[00:01:30]  And didn't know there'd be a dozen homeless men coming  Yeah, we had some of the homeless guys that stood out  Papa Rock  Of course, Papa Rock and his little amplifier that he always carries around  Blue was there  Blue, I was with Blue  The late, great Blue  I miss him to this day  Blue's gone too?  Blue is gone  Half a Hulk face was there  Yes, Half a Hulk face was there  I think he got his picture with Santa Claus  Slow motion was there  I don't quite remember him  He just spoke slowly, he was a large man  Okay  Without a home  Uh, Grey Wolf was there  The infamous Grey Wolf 
[00:02:00]  He wrote the song Shelter Me and recorded it and vocalized it and did all that  Rich Voss was there  Yes, the homeless Jew, Rich Voss  And, um, apparently it says here  This homeless person stole the show  But I don't know this one  Homeless Fez?  Homeless Fez  Nah, it doesn't ring a bell  Well, he apparently was a part of this thing  It was so great  We start in the studio  We move to the mall  What mall was this?  Short Hills  Short Hills Mall  In New Jersey  Also, I want to point out to everyone who usually writes in and complains 
[00:02:30]  This was simulcast on the satellite side  But on our terrestrial network as well  That's right  So you will hear it uncensored  But when they're complaining about certain things  Look, it's not beat  Don't give a shit about this  It's just the way it was back then  And you'll have to deal with it now  Deal with it  Because it's funny  And you'll enjoy it  And happy holidays  It's the homeless shopping spree  Only on the Opie and Anthony Show  But enough of this palaver  Let's get the show on the road  It's the Opie and Anthony Show 
[00:03:00]  The O and A virus spreading across America  Welcome to the homeless shopping spree  2006  Anthony already pissed off  Jimmy just arriving as I turn on all our mics  It's  It's  It's  What's the word here in New York City? 
[00:03:30]  Chaos  A bit crowded  A bit crowded  A bit dark  It's a bit dark in Midtown  I  Am livid  Livid  I heard nothing of this  This  Reverend Al protest march  Is that what it is?  Down 5th Avenue  I  I  I had to drive in from Long Island  Um  The drive was very pleasant 
[00:04:00]  Right up until  I got across the 59th Street Bridge  Onto  57th Street  In Manhattan  Where I was then  Turned off  Of 57th  Now I don't know how  You know how much  Everybody else can understand  Here in New York  You can if you  You work or live in the city  When you're on 57th  And they close it down  And you get turned off  57th is a main thoroughfare  Across town  The rest of the streets  Are these  Double parked  Single lane  Crappy roads 
[00:04:30]  That get  Packed  Crowded  With traffic  And the reason  That 57th was closed  Because Reverend Al  Had to have a march  Today  Today  Down 5th Avenue  Where all the  White people shop  Uh  For Christmas  And completely  Tie up  This effing city  Why can't they tell them no?  What  That's what I said  Uh  In between  The use of the N word  Every third word 
[00:05:00]  Out of my mouth  I set a personal record today  Which I'm very proud of  Yelling it out the window  Uh  In the car  Just with the windows  Rolled up to myself  Well I know the old record  Is 851 in one day  Blew it away  Blew it away  And in record time  Yeah  Well  I was  Just livid  So I get turned off  Of 57th  And when you're  You know  Driving down  And you plan  And you're timed out  What time you're gonna get here  And I have to be here  By a certain time 
[00:05:30]  It's my job  You know people  You know jobs  That's places you have to be  To make money  On a daily basis  Dad  I'm just filling in some people  That probably don't have them  When you're on 57th  And get turned off of it  You know  It's gonna tack another  At least 45 minutes to an hour  On wherever the hell you're going  Well  This city is a  Is a  Is a fine organism  And if you block off one street  Yep  I mean  If one car stalls  The whole city's effed 
[00:06:00]  The city gets screwed  They have it to a point  Driving around in Manhattan  Yep  One car stalls  Or they block off one road  Everybody's screwed  It doesn't matter  How far you're away  From this roadblock  Or this stalled car  The ripple effect  The ripple effect  Is ridiculous in Manhattan  And just to explain  Because people are a little  Clueless here  Yeah  Reverend Al decided today  To get  I don't know  Thousands upon thousands  Upon thousands  Thousands of people  Thousands of black people  Together to protest  What happened there in Queens  A few weeks back  The 50 shots  The groom getting shot  I understand 
[00:06:30]  That was a tragic event  Let  Let  The judicial system  Take care of it  Let a grand jury  Take care of it  Let people investigate it  And see what happens  And if  Then you don't get  The answer you want  Then do what you usually do  Effing riot  Okay  Keep  Let's keep things  The way they usually work  In this world  But  But while they're still  Doing the investigation  Could you let  Whitey shop  Let  Whitey shop  Let 
[00:07:00]  Whitey shop  Let  Whitey shop  You're tying up  Fifth Avenue  Was there a lot of traffic  When you were veered off it  It's like you couldn't believe  It's a nightmare out there  And  And how does that pertain  To today  Besides the fact that  Anthony is out of his  Freaking mind  We're trying to get together  This homeless shopping spree  2006  And  The buses  Is stuck in a roadblock  The homeless  The homeless  We can't dig up  All the homeless  We wanted to  Because we can't  Get around the city  To pick them up  Yeah the homeless  Are not where 
[00:07:30]  They're usually  Where they usually are  Because those streets  Are blocked off  For the march  Like here's  Here's something  We can't find Andrew  From the cake  Stopping incident  Goddamn  Led Zeppelin  He is  He's the who  Of this event  He is the star  Of this year's  Homeless shopping spree  2006  Of course the guy  Where he offered us a cake  I jumped on his cake  Everyone knows the bit  By now  Well he's usually  Outside a church  On 5th Avenue  5th Avenue  5th Avenue  Is the street  That is completely  Closed down  For this protest  Because Reverend Al's  Gotta march

[00:38:30]  Are you  But I'm bouncing from one friend's house to another  To stay a little cleaner  I've been off the booze  I go every now and then and get drunk  But it's this simple thing  The thing is that  If this record will be able to  Through America  Yeah  If you buy it  Yeah  I talked to Keith about  I want to put a $5 donation for  Some kind of coalition  That will  Keith will be in charge of the money  Oh coalition  So we can get homeless people housed in  Ah  And the rest I want to have a nice house for myself

[00:40:00]  Yeah  I was thinking about this thing  It was in the future  Where you guys will be looked upon  As like  Like forebears of some sort  Of  There was a  It was a vent  And  Yeah we'll be  Probably CGI effects  In the movie stuff  That happened later  I love this guy  Wow  The homeless matrix  The homeless matrix  Yeah  I'm going to work on that  All right  I heard there was free liquor as well  I like it  Thanks  The guy that almost fought Mr. Pell  All right  And  That was the key  No he's not here  Oh yeah where's G.I. 
[00:40:30]  We couldn't fight G.I.  I know yeah  He was a no joke  G.I.'s M.I.A.

[00:41:00]  Fez  You are homeless  And we're trying to  Take care of you  We're hearing  Different stories  I  I heard  The story about you  At the Apple store  Looking all disheveled  And people were taking  Pictures with their  Camera phones  And then sending them in  And apparently  You're living some kind of lie  Like  You're homeless  Yeah I was mistaken  For being homeless  On the street  A couple weekends ago  And now I'm part of  This homeless nativity scene  That you put together here  So I'm really confused  On how all this has happened  I don't know how 
[00:41:30]  What could  You know  I don't know how  Ronnie does so well  Yeah  You gotta renegotiate  Your contract  If this is the case  Because Ronnie does well  He has a place to live  And everything  You know  Nice clothes  Nice clothes  Cigars  And you  End up a homeless bum  On the streets  On the homeless shopping spree  I heard there was a meal  Really that's why I'm here  What are you looking forward to  Buying at the mall  I'm supposed to get  Church pants  Tight itchy church pants  Church pants 
[00:42:00]  And cigars I hear  Oh yeah  That's also on my list  Cigars  I can't come home  Without cigars  I can't beat  You don't smoke cigars  Yes  Yes  If anyone asks  I do  I'm supposed to say  I smoke cigars  I'm blinking a code to you  Get me out of this  No you belong here  This looks like the casting call  For the part of Grady  On Sam  What am I doing here  You're in some kind of denial  Is what it is  And we're just trying to get you 
[00:42:30]  To that next step  Because you're in denial  You've got to face  Your life  And the way it is  You're homeless  So what's next  I stay here with you guys  And everyone else  Leaves on the bus  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  That's blue  He's taking over  A mic over there  That's not blue  It's just really dark black  Wow  Well Fez  Welcome to the  Homeless shopping spree  2006  My only advice

[00:59:00]  The biggest crowd  By far  I mean by far  One year we had  A couple thousand easily  Yeah  I think this is  Way over that  Way over that  This year  Once the people are there  Yeah  Once we get the homeless  And they're shopping  Yeah these are just  The people that showed up early  Well because what happens too  There's people in  In their cars  In the parking lot  And doing a little  You know pre-game  They're just hanging out  Tailgating  Yeah as soon as they know  That the bus is close  Then all of a sudden  All those people  Will join the crowd  I see Lady Di  I see No Filter Paul  Pal talk rocks  Yeah when the 
[00:59:30]  When the bus pulls in  It is an event  I mean that  The cheering starts  The fans line  The side of the road  And the bus pulls in  Like it is a rock  A rock band  Tour bus  Coming in  And then when they  Get off of that bus  The cheers that they get  Hey someone on  Pal talk  Can go F themselves  I hate when  Opie exaggerates  What am I exaggerating about  What am I exaggerating about  Hey you know  It's not going to be  Exaggerated  When reports come in

[01:18:30]  That it's crazy here  They blocked off like  Two of the main entrances  Yeah  So it's kind of hard  Getting in  So but where  Everyone's at  I mean people are  Hanging off the parking  Decks like it's just  Pack  Oh man  It's awesome  I can't wait to see  The video and the pictures  Because I can't imagine  We're getting glimpses  Every once in a while  From the Pal Talk cameras  They're on site  But their batteries  Are running out  Or they're trying to save power  Yeah they're saving power  So it's kind of like  A NASA mission 
[01:19:00]  Every once in a while  You get a little glimpse  And then  Yeah yeah  They got to shut down  Power to save batteries  Until the big moment  Until the big moment  Touchdown  Right right  Now it's crazy here  I mean everyone is just  So excited for  For the homeless people  To come and enjoy  And enjoy themselves  Right on  Thank you Melanie  For the update  No problem guys  Have a good holiday  Alright let's go to the bus  See where they're at  We got Steve  Steve I'm sure  Is just thrilled  To be on the bus  With the homeless  He hates the clean listeners  Yeah  What's up Steve  Hey boys 
[01:19:30]  How are you  What's going on  On the bus there Steve  Well the stench  Is really starting to move  From the back of the bus  To the front of the bus  I couldn't be happier  About that  I'm trying to  I'm actually trying  To break wind  To offset it  But it's not working  Break wind  We're moving nicely  It looks like we have  A state official  Or no we don't  Oops  Oops  Oops  You guys are on your own  Aren't you  Wink wink  Nudge nudge  Yeah  But it looks like 
[01:20:00]  We're gonna  It looks like  We're gonna be  Hearing another  Christmas carol Danny  Yeah  This one is called  Pendulum  It's from  The band  Foundry  Handed out some  Of the foundry CDs  I had left over  Did ya  I had about  900 of them  Left over  And the homeless  Don't want them  900  Hey Steve  Any problems  On the bus  Okay  What's that  Any problems  On the bus  Hold on 
[01:20:30]  I can't hear you  There's a bum  Making noise  Any problems  On the bus  No not at all  Actually  No  I think  I think  Blue got a little  Bit upset  Before when  When you played  The Grey Wolf song  Yeah  Yeah he got  A little bit jealous  He heard the tribute  To Tippi Tom  And he got  A little bit jealous  And started  Making some noise  But that was  Very temporary  But everybody's  Actually been  Pretty subdued  So far  Okay  Boy he can't  Stand Tippi Tom  No he can't  Red doesn't like  Tippi Tom  No  Oh Blue hates  Tippi Tom  Blue doesn't like  Why was Blue  Getting upset 
[01:21:00]  I don't know  He just  He heard the song  And he got all  Upset  And he was all  Ornery  Why ain't there  No song about me  Why don't we go  Talk to Blue  Real fast  I hate to do this  To you Steve  But  I know  Jinks  I hate this  He really does  Jesus  Now this one  Bumped in my way  Hey Blue  They want to talk  Yeah  Hey Blue  Blue  Blue  Blue  Why did you 
[01:21:30]  Get so upset  When  Is he just  Gonna yap  Over me  Probably  So hard  To talk  To the homeless  Blue  Why do you  Want to talk  To the homeless  Why do you  Want to talk  To me Blue  We're talking  To you Blue  Why were you  Upset when you  Heard the  Grey Wolf song  Hello  See it's  Imposive  This is why  They're homeless  He's talking  Into the earpiece  And he has  The mouthpiece  By his ear  Let's try again  Anthony  Why don't you  Try  Blue 
[01:22:00]  Blue  Why were you  Getting upset  And ornery  When the  Grey Wolf song  There's no  You might as  Well just  Throw a cell  Phone into a  Monkey cage  And expect to  Get some kind  Of an answer  From him  My phone  Has bum  Cheese on it  Bum  Cheese  That's good  Disinfect my  Phone now  Wow that does 
[01:22:30]  Not sound like  A happy situation  To be in  No  I'm glad I'm  Not on that bus  If we had gone  Of course we  Would have  Pulled up first  In a nice  Limousine or  Something  As a prelude  But these  Poor bastards  That have to  Ride on this  Danny's on the  Bus too  Yeah let's say  Hi to Danny  Danny  Hey guys  Hey  What's going on  Just for you guys  Another reason  That Blue  Couldn't hear you  Is because he  Had the earpiece  Of Steve's phone  Pressed up  Against his cheek  Dope  They are just 
[01:23:00]  Dopey bums  Yeah  Oh my god  How is it  What's the  Atmosphere like  In the  Buzz  And by atmosphere  I don't mean  Like the feel  I mean the real  Atmosphere  Air wise  What is it like  It's very thick  There's no other way  I can describe it  Besides thick  Isn't that true  When the homeless  Come in here  Like before  When the whole  Crowd was in here  It's a thickness  That the air takes on  It's a heaviness  It's pungent  Pungent  Is the word  Pungent  Because their odor  Is so deep  It's such a deep  It's a dull odor  Dank  Dank 
[01:23:30]  Dank  It's a rotting  Odor  They're odoriferous  Fungal masses  Many parts of their bodies  Rotting away  Yeah  Rot  There's a rot  Moldy  Dank  Dark  Deep  Heaviness  They smell like  The opposite  Of money  Danny  Any other observations  From the bus  It's been a pretty  Pretty tame ride  So far  They're being  Very very behaved  It's funny  Because Grey Wolf  The entire time  I don't think 
[01:24:00]  Has once gotten  Off of his cell phone  Oh really  It's nice to see  A homeless guy  With a cell phone  By the way  And you know  During one of the breaks  Blue was singing  Silent Night  So I thought  It would be a good idea  If he sang it on the air  Yeah let's do that  Alright  Blue to sing  Silent Night  By himself  In honor of Ziggy  Who passed  One of my homeless friends  That used to go on  The homeless shopping spree  He's got the words  In front of him  Alright you ready  You're gonna sing  Silent Night  Alright  Go for it  Silent Night 
[01:24:30]  Holy Night  Holy Night  All of my  You have to sing  Come on  But  See  In  Heavenly  Yeah I think  That's about all  We're gonna get  Blue  Blue is a dope  He stinks 
[01:25:00]  And by the way  I brought  I brought the  Polaroid camera  In case anybody  Wants a picture  With half a Hulk  Size letter  Oh nice  For five bucks  Yeah we're doing  Photo ops  With half Hulk face  As well  For the people  That show up  At the mall  Danny how much  Are the photos  Going to be  Photos I think  They're gonna go  For five dollars  Hey Danny  I want to talk  To some more  Of the homeless people  Who do you think  Will be good right now  Well I would give you  To Tippi Tom  But he keeps 
[01:25:30]  He's cursing  Way too much  Yeah  Yeah he's a loose cannon  Hey Danny  Just say hey Tippi  Do you want to talk  To the guys  Yeah  Hey Tippi Tom  You want to talk  To the guys  Yeah  Danny goes  To Big Red  Hey Tippi Tom  You want to talk  To the guys  And he goes  Suck my  He was very upset  Oh does he  He gets so pissed  He gets  Man can you imagine  There's gonna be 
[01:26:00]  About a thousand guys  Cheering Tippi Tom  Tippi Tom  When Big Red  Gets off the bus  They're all gonna be  Tippi Tom  Tippi Tom  Danny anyone else  We could talk to  Right now  Yeah I got this  One guy here  I think his name  Is Lez or something  Fez  Hang on  Oh Fez  Ah  Yes from the  Ron and Fez show  He's in denial still  Yeah  He still thinks  He's not homeless  Poor guy  Brown brown brown  Brown brown brown  Brown brown brown  The cell on the bus  Is booze and crap  Booze and crap  Booze and crap  I don't think 
[01:26:30]  That's the way  That song goes  Are you having  A good time  Fez  Yeah you know  We just did  Have a nice moment  We passed  Raleigh prison  In New Jersey  Yeah  The homeless  Got to wave  To their friends  You know this isn't  Just about helping  The homeless out  You're near homeless  But it's also about  Kind of you know  Getting you out  And  And mingling  With people  Yeah  You know  For some reason 
[01:27:00]  All the homeless  Have decided to use  The bathroom  On this trip  It's a short trip  To the law  Oh no  And they all had to go  Use the bathroom  The bad part is  There's no toilet  On this bus  I was gonna say  And they all used  The bathroom  I was gonna say  I don't remember  There being a toilet  But now it makes  Perfect sense  Yeah  I hope it's Steve's  Stupid laptop bag  And I do have  One complaint  Yeah  You know  I was nervous  Going through  The Lincoln Tunnel 
[01:27:30]  Yeah  You know  We finally got out  The other side  Hit the light of day  My brooch was missing  Where's my brooch?  My brooch was missing  When the lights came back on  My brooch was gone  My brooch was missing  You gotta watch them Fez  They're not  They're not the most honest people  No  Not at all  They're used to  That's something  You're gonna have to  Figure out how to do  When you're completely homeless  Is you know  Take advantage of people  When they're sleeping  Or in the dark  Or something like that  Exactly  You know what's nice  Is the bus company  This has got to be 
[01:28:00]  The last time  They're able to use this bus  Before they retire it  It's done  It's gonna have to be burned  This bus is going to the yard  After this one  The only use for this bus now  Is that they're making  One of those man-made reefs  And they dump it  And they dump it  And they dump it  Yeah  A reef  Like they do with old subway cars  Yeah  Yeah right on  It'll help the fish  Alright Fez  Hang in there  Hey can we talk to Kenny  I want to get a  Oh here he is  Let's say hi to Kenny  And then get an ETA  Kenny

[01:39:00]  Obviously they're  Introducing the homeless  But there's just  Way too many people  They just introduced  Big Pop  Big Pop  Yeah yeah 
[01:39:30]  Hold the phone up  So we can hear them too  Absolutely  All right  Next off the bus  We have a contestant  From W1  Fan Philly  All away from Philly  David  All right  We can hear a little better  Our next contestant  His name is James  They also form  Slow Mo  Can you remember him  From the watermelon man  It is James  James

[01:43:00]  Yeah  Alright so  Obviously the phone's  Having a very hard time  Picking up the  Sheer amount of sound  That was coming out  Of the crowd over there  While they were introducing  The homeless  Getting off the bus  Gearing up for the homeless  Shopping spree  Inside the mall  I'm thinking  Perhaps  Because you know  We're doing this live  And on Saturday  But we will replay this Monday  Hopefully  Sam  Has this all taped  With his camera  And perhaps we could  Pull the sound  Of the intros  And them coming off the bus  Yes  And put that 
[01:43:30]  In the place  Of the phone  Yeah  Audio  So that way  It'll sound a lot better  On Monday  Or at the worst  It'll be up on  OpieAndAnthony.com  Whatever they figure out  I'd like it to sound  Really nice on the air  On Monday  When we replay it  So if that's at all possible  Of course  That would sound a lot better  Than just the phone connection  But yeah  All this will be  The video  You'll see  The audio  And the photos  That our  People are taking  And the fans are taking  Are going to be  All over the place  So you'll get  A really good view 
[01:44:00]  And the sound  Of what's going on  Without the smell  Which is good  We should have sent  Our own guy  We didn't think  We should have sent  A Paltalk camera down  That was  We should have  Well the problem is  There's so many people  Trying to check out  The Paltalk cameras  A lot of traffic  Too much traffic  We can't get it working right  Yes  We want to get a peek  At what's going on over there  Deb's camera seems to be  The one that  Is the one that won't come up  Right  And that's the one  We really need  Yeah that's the one  We kind of need  She's probably very frustrated too  I bet she is  But just to give you  The visuals 
[01:44:30]  Obviously  The bus  Pulled up to the mall  There was just  Who knows how many people  It just sounded like thousands  I don't know  We'll get the numbers later on  And you know  As Keith was introducing  These guys one by one  They would step off the bus  And the crowd was just  Giving them nothing but love  Let's say hi to Danny  He's at the mall  Danny  Hi guys  Alright what's going on Danny  Dude this is unbelievable  I can't even  I can't even estimate  How many people  Are here for this thing  There's that many people  It's like a sea of people  It just never ends  Yeah like fill in some 
[01:45:00]  Of the pictures for us  When the bus pulled up  What was going on  Everybody was just  Losing their minds  And you should have seen  Some of the actual  Customers of this mall  Just be absolutely disgusted  When you guys pulled in  Was the crowd chasing the bus  Were they opening up  Like the Red Sea  Well basically  They were like on the side  Of the entrance  And I mean  It was as far  As far as you could see  It was people  And you know  It looked like a lot of people 
[01:45:30]  And it was  And then we looked  Inside the entrance  And it was just  It was just  Thleaded with people  It was three times  As many people  As we thought it was  In the first place  Wow  So the entire mall  Yeah  Unbelievable here  How many people  Would you estimate  At least 2,500 people  That's ridiculous  Oh my god  Great  This is easily  The biggest one  We've ever done  Hands down  Hey Danny  Do these people  Look like the normal  Shoppers at the  Short Hills Mall  Oh yeah  When we pulled up  Everybody started 
[01:46:00]  Screaming at the top  Of their lungs  And this couple  Of really old ladies  They almost fell down  You just don't get it  Unbelievable  I've never seen  Anything like this  And then as the homeless  Like got off the bus  What was the feel  It was actually  Everybody was really cool  They were very excited  For everybody  To come off the bus  And these guys  These guys are gonna  Walk away with so much stuff  I mean just the amount  Of people here  That are gonna buy stuff  For these guys  They're going home  With way more  Than those $200 gift cards  We gave them  Do you know the ovation 
[01:46:30]  That stupid Andrew  Would have gotten  If he got on that bus  That dope  Yeah and the actual  Dippy Tom  Yeah we're done  With Andrew  Well dude he's a homeless guy  We don't know  Where it happened to him  He might have fell asleep  So he's a beach  He can't even maintain a house  Who cares  We're done with him  We're so done with him  That's funny  He's irresponsible  Right  Hey Danny  Have you guys all  Split up now  We're done with Andrew  No not yet  We're about to do that  And what I didn't even realize  Was as many people  As there are  On this main floor  I just looked up

Boots or something  Good for the winter?  Just some sort of  High top sneaker  Oh  Alright are you guys  All split up at this point?  Yeah they're actually  I guess the policy here  Is to close the metal gate  After the homeless  Get in here  So there's a whole bunch  Of fans just waiting 
[02:14:30]  To get in outside  The homeless are shopping  Like Paris Hilton shops  Yeah  And like big celebrity shops  They go in the stores  And the stores close down  Exclusive service  Just for that person  You know security  Got together  Had all sorts of meetings  Oh you know it  And this is what they decided  Okay when one of the homeless  Goes into one of the stores  You know close the gate  Pull down the gate  This will keep the crowds  From coming in  And perhaps having  An inventory loss  Then when the homeless  Want to leave  Lift the gate again  And release them  I gotta tell you 
[02:15:00]  The gang at the mall  At Short Hills  Showing they got  You know  A good sense of humor  So far  And they got their  Security together  Doing the catch and release  Program with the homeless  Let's get a Nick in Jersey  Nick what's up?

[03:07:30]  Yeah what are some  Of your other thoughts  There Steve  My opinion of homeless people  Has remained the same  They stink  I really don't like  Being any closer to them  Right now  Who would  It was  We actually  At Brookstone  Big Pop bought  Actually spent the last  Of his gift card  Buying a young lady  An inflatable neck pillow  He spent 80 bucks  Buying her inflatable neck pillow  Well  Dope  That's nice and sweet 
[03:08:00]  And all  But why  Who the rock guy  No the  Big  Like the  One of the  The guys  The key  I guess  At the last minute  Big Pop  One of the big black guys  He just  He was being smooth  He was putting the moves on her  He was sitting in a massage chair  I decided he wanted to buy her a present  And spent the last 80 bucks  On his card  Buying her an inflatable neck pillow  You know how much alcohol  That idiot could have bought  I know  80 bucks  20 minutes worth  Why didn't he just buy it for himself  He sleeps in the street  Why not  I have no idea  How did your neck pillow pop 
[03:08:30]  Hey Steve  Have you guys pulled away  How did your liver die  We're back on the road now  We're heading back  All right  Very good  Yeah  I'm seeing a little slide show  That's up on one of the cams  Of pictures that were taken  Yeah  This is great  I'm just watching on PalTalk  One of the cameras has a slide show of pictures  That have been taken  And just crowds of people  Unbelievable amounts of people  Packed wall to wall 
[03:09:00]  They go the entire length of the mall  And I'm looking at another live camera  Of people still milling around outside  After the bus is already gone  Sharing experiences I'm sure with each other  Yeah  Memories that will last  An hour or two  Wow  Something else just happened  Than  Shooting I hope  Than  Yes  This is I guess  Truly a holiday story  Gray Wolf  Apparently when he gets off the bus  In New York  Is going to be meeting his son  For the first time 
[03:09:30]  In 27 years  Wow  Yeah  Now how did that get  Hooked up  Do you want to talk to him for a second  Yeah  Yeah sure  He won't be able to  Understand us  Hey Gray Wolf  What's up  What's up  I got my son on my phone  Right  And  When he was three years old  I did a bid  And  I never got to see him  For 24 years  Went to jail  He's 27 years old now  And he called me  Last Friday  Today he wants to meet me 
[03:10:00]  Right on the show  He's on his way from Connecticut  To come down with his wife  And his kids  I'm a grandfather  Wow  Oh wow  How do you feel  I'm emotional  Yeah  My son is listening to us right now  He's on my line  He's getting a little choked up  Uh Gray Wolf  What  I got a question for you  Yes  What is the  First thing you're going to do  When you see your son  For the first time  I don't even  Oh you suck  You suck 
[03:10:30]  That  That ain't even close  To being right  And here I am  An idiot  I'm sitting here  Waiting to hear  Like maybe  What he'll do  Bam  Oh  Just an emotionless  Cyborg  Wait  We have to get rid of it  Well I'm gonna 
[03:11:00]  Click  Who cares  Oh horrid  Can we uh  Can we get video of that meeting  I'm sure  I would love that  If we make sure  I  Sam  Make sure Sam  Has his camera rolling  So we have that  I do  I do want to ask 
[03:11:30]  Gray Wolf  Yeah  Yeah  Hey let's say hi  To Rich Voss  Rich  Hey what's going on  What's up buddy  He's literally in front of  Gray Wolf  Cause he's got a tear  Coming from his eye  Right now  Yeah he's  He's a bit emotional  About his son  He actually  Sent out a smoke signal  And it just got to him  Is what happened  His son wanted to see him  Years ago  He has his ear to the floor  On the bus  One wagon  Four horses  I know  Here's the thing 
[03:12:00]  I just realized  How hard it is to be homeless  These guys  They're all over the place  But  Everybody was so nice  But the gap  The gap is the worst  There was a bunch of  Pretentious salesmen  It was like we got  Thrown out of the gap  By Nathan Lane  It was horrible  And the girl  The little sales girl  Going  This is a mockery  Of homeless  Okay  You know what  You're a sales person  At the gap  Shut your face  And work to register  A mockery  I wonder if that was  The same girl  That called us  I bet you that was 
[03:12:30]  The same snooty  Little brat  That called us  How is it a mockery  Of the homeless  To take them  Have them get the  Adulation  Of thousands of people  And then have  A bunch of people  Spend money on them  And let them  Get warm clothes  And ridiculous  Other items  For Christmas  How is that  Exploiting them  Yeah we have fun  With them  Just like we do  When anyone else  Comes in the studio  We goof on everybody  Each other  And to goof on  A homeless guy  What are you going  To talk about  The way they smell 
[03:13:00]  It's horrible  Wait Rich  The gap threw you out  How can you  Exploit them  When you're not  Going to talk to them  For another year now  You know what I mean  Wait the gap  Tossed all you guys out  That to me  Is a nice way  To treat the homeless  They're not good enough  To shop in the gap  Their money isn't good enough  To spend in the gap  Around the holidays  Yeah but all of a sudden  They want to  You know they're donating  All their money  For disease cures  That's all their billboards  Until the disease  Walks into their store  Literally  What a bunch of snots  What an elitist  Snotty store 
[03:13:30]  Alright let's  Thank you Rich  You did a great job  Man for us  I really appreciate it  Thanks man  Alright let me  Let me say hi to Danny  He's on the bus  Danny what's up  Hey guys how's everything  Alright you guys  Get out of there live  I see  Yeah it was unbelievable  I mean I can't even believe  The amount of people  That were buying  These guys stuff  They really came to the table  Yeah  Are you observing  Some of the gifts  What did everyone get  That would be pretty interesting  As we wrap up  The homeless shopping spree here  Alright they said what now  What did they end up buying 
[03:14:00]  That we don't know about  Oh well  Actually to be honest with you  They spent so much time  Just dawdling  That they didn't really get  To many stores  Jackass lazy homeless idiots  All they wanted to do  Is go drinking  I mean it really  It really showcases  The reason why  These guys  They can do that  Every other day of the week  Why on one day  When they're able to  Actually take advantage  Of other people  And get some  Things they can use  For the winter  Do they have to spend it  Being lazy and drinking booze 
[03:14:30]  Can't they just take  One day off  From taking their life off  This is the only time  This winter  They'll be able to  Drink indoors  Yeah yeah  Exactly  That's why they want  To have a drink  Sit down and enjoy a beer  Without being punched  And bricked  Well at the very least  They have the balance  Of their cars  They could spend elsewhere  Alright Danny  Get a sing along together  I'll go back to you  That's how we're gonna end  Alright  Tell them the gift cards  Work great for jimmying  Doors open too  If they want to rob people  Let's say hi to brother Elmo  He did a great job too 
[03:15:00]  Elmo what's up  Hey man  Yeah we're all on a bus here  Just kind of talking about  What went on  The goods and the bad  A lot of bad  But a lot of good  Yeah like what  What's some of the bad  Some of the bad  You know some of the  The people working  On the counters  Were pretty awful  But uh  And uh  The guys  Me and Roland had  They were really  Everybody was really  Cool helping us out  Well Elmo why were they awful  They were rude  You know it's a mockery  Of you know  These homeless people  That kind of stuff 
[03:15:30]  You know we heard that  A bunch  And we just ignored them  And just went to other people  Who were more than  Willing to help out  Good  Very good  Creeps  It was good  Our one guy  Marcus  You look at him  And you could tell  Why he's a homeless guy  He's just a psychopath  But instead of buying stuff  He wanted to go to Starbucks  Sit back in a nice cozy chair  And enjoy a nice latte  And chat with the customers  So we were like  Like a real person  Yeah  And he was losing his mind  Trying to get him out 
[03:16:00]  It's like dude  You know you could buy some stuff  What are you doing  He wanted to be  Again if we can bring up Shawshank  He wanted to be like  The guys on the roof  Drinking the beer that one day  Yeah  Just drinking beers  Like regular guys  On the roof  And then you're back  In prison again  He was like the elephant man  When he got his shaving kit  And he delicately dabbed  A little calogne  On his stupid neck  Calogne  And he tried brushing  That rotten head  With his little human comb  Those little wispy cancer hairs 
[03:16:30]  Over that giant mountain of the head  He just wanted to go  Into a Starbucks  For one day  A little  A few minutes  And actually not get kicked out  Be able to buy something  And sit there  Like a real human being  Like a gentleman  Right a gentleman  I think he's just a psychopath  And has nothing to do with that  He kept trying on different ones  Because one of his feet  Apparently is larger  Than the other ones  So it was just a nightmare  Like a run over by a bus  Like gout  And tire marks on it  Alright Elmo 
[03:17:00]  Great job  Thank you so much  Good job  Alright guys  Alright  It's a dope  Surprised he didn't go get  Like scuba gear  Idiots  Why would that guy spend  $80 on a neck pillow  For some chick  Why  Buy it for yourself  It's funny that you guys  Are trying to figure it out  Yeah  Do you know how many meals  You can buy with that  I know  It does  You're homeless  Don't go  You go to Burger King  For a month on that  Yep  Let's say hi to Fez  Fez  Hi boys  Hey  Gap may I help you
