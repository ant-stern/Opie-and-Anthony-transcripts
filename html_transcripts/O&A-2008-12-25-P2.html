<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Dennis Leary's comedic song about a sexually suggestive interpretation of the nativity story.  This transitioned into the second annual "Homeless Shopping Spree," a live broadcast from a bus carrying ten homeless individuals, each given $100, to Roosevelt Field Mall.  The bus, equipped with bathrooms and pornography playing on screens, was a scene of chaos from the start.  Passengers, nicknamed "Sperm," "Tippy Tom," "Rock and Roll Tommy," and "Blue," among others, engaged in fights, intoxication, urination, and even defecation.  Staff members Ben, Rick, Psycho Mark, and Jim Norton, along with the hosts, attempted to manage the increasingly absurd situation, while providing commentary and interviewing callers.  Jim Norton repeatedly expressed his need to use the bathroom. Tippi Tom repeatedly fell asleep, scratched himself, and threatened violence; Rock and Roll Tommy threatened self-harm and later had an "alcoholic seizure"; and Blue displayed erratic and aggressive behavior.  Ziggy believed he was on an airplane.  The hosts, facing escalating tension and considering the potential consequences of giving the passengers beer, ultimately decided to do so, despite Keith's warnings of a potential riot.  Callers reported a large following of cars and rumors of police involvement at the mall.

The arrival at Roosevelt Field Mall was met with significant commotion, a large crowd, and a heavy police presence.  While largely celebratory, the police were needed to manage the crowd and the increasingly erratic behavior of some participants.  Several stores, including Victoria's Secret and Armani, initially refused entry.  The shopping spree itself was chaotic, with one individual jumping into a bathtub display.  Participants bought various items, including clothes, a boombox, and a radio.  The event concluded with the group going to a bar, resulting in further intoxication among some participants.  Throughout this segment, the hosts and guests used extensive profanity.

The aftermath of the shopping spree featured more phone calls from Psycho Mark, Rick, Ben, and Steve detailing intoxicated participants, enthusiastic crowds, and incidents such as Psycho Mark losing his teeth and Andre nearly exposing himself.  A caller criticized the show's lack of originality.  This transitioned into a recording of Frankie Blue, the program director of their former station WNEW, drunkenly broadcasting a radio show after an apparent argument with a female DJ, repeatedly mispronouncing the station's call letters. The hosts and callers speculated on his likely firing and discussed WNEW's struggles since Opie and Anthony's departure.  The "Homeless for the Holidays" CD was promoted.

The broadcast continued with a discussion of Frankie Blue's firing, which involved yelling and potentially manhandling a female co-host; an audio clip was played.  The hosts used homophobic slurs to describe corporate radio executives.  This led to a promotion for a RuPaul-involved contest with a $50,000 prize.  An interview with the cast of *A Christmas Story* (Zach Ward, Ian Petrella, and Scott Schwartz) followed, covering their experiences filming the movie and explicit details about Scott Schwartz's adult film career.  The conversation then shifted to Christmas, featuring jokes about gift-giving, technology, and personal experiences, interspersed with listener calls.  "Golden Buns" repeatedly exposed his buttocks on air.

The show continued with a highly inappropriate and sexually suggestive discussion about Robert Reed, using homophobic slurs and making crude jokes. This segued into a profane, sexually suggestive Christmas skit featuring Santa Claus.  A listener called, expressing anger about the Santa Claus jokes made in the presence of his three-year-old son.  The hosts spoke to the child, telling him "there's no Santa Claus."  The broadcast concluded with a Christmas carol performance by Ziggy and repeated website addresses.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony 
[00:00:30]  Dream what Santa brings them  Unless they're Jewish or Muslim  Or some other chip religion  Crappy toys flying off the shelves  Midgets dressed up to look like cows  Spread good cheer or burn in hell  It's a merry fucking Christmas  All the kids go to bed each night  Dream what Santa brings them 
[00:01:00]  Unless they're Jewish or Muslim  Or some other chip religion  Cracklin' fires to keep me warm  And my collection of Asian boys  Cradle my bells and work my hord  It's a keep on truckin'  Last year suckin'  Midget chuckin'  Slap the puckin'  How much wood could a wood chuck chuckin'  Merry fucking Christmas  Hey, this is Dennis Leary here 
[00:01:30]  I listen to the Opie and Anthony  Hey, this is Dennis Leary here  I listen to the Opie and Anthony show  Every day  Yeah, right  Howdy how  Virgin Mary was sleeping  When Angel Gabriel appeared  He said you are to be the virgin mother  But Mary thought that was weird  Mary said I'm not a virgin  I blew a guy last year 
[00:02:00]  But then Gabriel said to Mary  My child, have no fear  You can suck all the dick you want  And still be a virgin  Mary  You can suck all the dick you want  And still not be considered flawed  Although you went to town  And sucked some semen down  You're still a virgin  In the eyes of God  There was no room at the end 
[00:02:30]  When Mary and Joseph did arrive  But they were so very tired  You see  And Mary had to offer a bribe  Since she had no money  How would she pay for a place to sleep?  Gabriel appeared to Mary  And told her not to weep  Cause you can suck all the dick you want  And still be a virgin  Mary  You can suck all the dick you want  And still be the mother of Christ 
[00:03:00]  If there's no room at the inn  Then it's not considered a sin  To suck some dick  To get a room for the night  Then three wise men did appear  Bearing gifts of myrrh and such  They said that they had followed a star  And missed a woman's touch  Mary thought she might pleasure them  But could not take them too bad  But again Gabriel appeared to her 
[00:03:30]  And this is what he said  You can suck all the dick you want  And still be a virgin  Mary  You can suck all the dick you want  Everyone that hangs in the nation  Felicio ain't no sin  Gonna blow those three wise men  And you'll still be a virgin  Cause there was no penetration  So you can suck all the dick you want  And still be a virgin 
[00:04:00]  Mary  The donkey and the ox and the lambs  And even the little drummer boy  People will remember your name quick  They'll say damn that bitch could suck a good dick  Cause suckin' dick brings peace on earth and joy  Cause suckin' dick brings peace on earth and joy  Mary, Mary suck that dick  Opie and Anthony 
[00:04:30]  Hodge was a punk just like any other boy  And he never had no trouble  Till he started up his oivet  Safe in the garage  Singing in the tub  But Hodge went too far  And he plugged in as a pump  It was a cold Christmas Eve  When Trevor and his skins 
[00:05:00]  Popped in full apart  And then they got back and frisked  Tammered like the music  What not the unity  He was wound on his servant  And he knocked him to his knees  The door came down on Christmas Day  I know exactly what he say  He said  Oi to the conks  And oi to the skins  But oi to the world  And everybody went  Hodge was a bloody mess  He ran out through the crowd  He said  We'll meet again  We are bloody yet unbowed  Trevor pulled his gloves  And told him about a meet Christmas Day  On the roof  Down on 20th Street  He thought came down on Christmas Day

[00:06:30]  But oi to the world  And everybody wins  If God came down on Christmas Day  I know exactly what he'd say  He'd say oi to the pups  And oi to the skins  But oi to the world  And everybody wins  There we go  Here we go  Rock and roll  Let's go homeless guitar dude  What'd you do?

Alright  Someone is on the line  Oh, they just hung up  They said  We should allow the homeless people to curse today  Because this is more like a documentary  Well, that's true  Like, scared straight  The prisoners were able to curse and whatnot  Anthony from West Orange is saying  He's wetting his pants  Just listening to this  And  Sheep Lover is saying  I have to say  Even before they get to the mall  Homeless shopping spree too 
[00:29:30]  Better than the original  Well, yeah  Because no one was in our way this time around, Anthony  They wanted us to go to the shelters last time  And Anthony from West Orange again  Saying that perhaps Ziggy marked his territory for the ride back  Okay  That's what he was  Okay  A couple  I got a couple  Junk mail, Jerry, from the city  These malls have to feel like the different countries of Europe  Wondering which one of them were going to be next on the German invasion list  And then  Somebody else wondering if there's a 15-year-old boy writer for the Rolling Stone magazine 
[00:30:00]  Going along on the bus almost homeless  Is what they would call that  We will announce the mall we're going to about 15 minutes before we get there  Okay  Dave from Jersey  Voss is going  Jesus  Bad smell  Bad language  And now bad jokes  Hey, Voss  Hey  What's up, Voss?  How you doing, man?  My eyes are tearing  Yeah, that's what  We hear the smells really bad 
[00:30:30]  I think what we should do is just take them up to the woods and hunt them  Okay  And the winner keeps all the money  A homeless hunt  The homeless hunt  I'm telling you  That sounds like maybe next year  This is unbelievable  I don't know  This smell  I don't know  This stink is worse than Norris' act  But this is bad stink in here  And I'm  Listen to me  I'm not  I'm scared to go back there  Yeah  Are all you guys hanging out at the front of the bus?  Yeah, we're hanging out at the front  I'm going to go back there  See if any of them can write me some new material 
[00:31:00]  All right, Voss  All right, I'm going to go back there for a second  They're all going  I know the struggle  All right, Voss  Thank you  All right, cool  RJ from Boston  Is Blue too stupid to realize that jail would be an upgrade in his lifestyle?  Yeah  Why are they so bummed about  Rick?  Yo  How's it going?  It's going okay  Blue wants to wish everybody now a Merry Christmas  Oh, is he okay now?  He's not crying anymore?  He seems to be okay  Yeah, he's giving everybody high fives  He's showing the love  Are we going to be doing some kind of Christmas carols later on? 
[00:31:30]  Oh, yeah  Those are coming up as soon as we get onto a highway  Great  And Ben is on the phone  He says he's in the back of the bus with Rock and Roll Tommy  Well, let's go to Ben  Let's talk to Ben  First time Ben's checking in from the bus  Ben?  Guys, Rock and Roll Tommy is in the back of the bus  Spraying Lysol all over the place  He's disgusted with the smell himself  Rock and Roll Tommy is disgusted with the smell  What's with the smell, Rock and Roll Tommy?  Huh?  What do you think of the smell back here? 
[00:32:00]  It smells fine with the air fresher  They're spraying air fresher all over the place  Ben, I know you get really easily grossed out by this stuff  How are you dealing with the smell?  Lots of Lysol  Yeah  Lots of Lysol  And this is my first trip to the back of the bus  All the guys are in the back  And like Norton and Boss are hidden in the front  And Mark and Rick are all in the front  This is a day that will make Ben very happy  And are the homeless guys  Have they started drinking alcohol yet?  No, we're trying to control that 
[00:32:30]  They've been asking for it  But with the condition of some of them  We thought we'd hold off for a little while  Yeah, I think maybe a couple of beers  Before they get to the mall  But not too many  Yeah, I could agree with that  All right  Okay  Thank you, Ben  All right  Hey, is traffic moving?  What's that?  Is the traffic moving along?  Yeah, we're still  We're on 57th and 1st Avenue right now  Oh  We're moving along  Oh, is that our first hint?

I don't think it's very ethical  Where are you from?  Salamanca  Then don't listen, you twat  No  What, what seems to be your problem, uh, Tricia? 
[00:34:30]  Well, I just think that having these people on display to be riddick  Bye-bye  That's how much we care about you and your stupid phone call  You know something?  Don't wreck our buzz today  They're going to have, uh, money and go to the malls and get some, uh, clothing  There you go  Have some fun  And these guys are, uh, completely, uh, into it, man  They're thrilled  Yeah  To have the opportunity to be part of this today  Ray, what's up?  No, my child  Can you hear me?  Yeah  Tell me that guy, Blue, doesn't sound like Damon Wayans from A Living Core  Oh, when he would do the, uh, homeless guy? 
[00:35:00]  Yeah  He was, uh, crapping in the jar and stuff?  Yeah  He does  Remember that bit Damon Wayans used to do?  Blue does sound just like him  Just like him  I can't wait to get a little more of Blue, uh, on the phone  And then once they get to the mall  Oh, my God  Trying to keep them together  You know what it is?  They're on a bus  They can't move around right now  How the hell are they going to keep those guys together?  We were just trying to keep them on the bus for an hour  And it was a nightmare  Yeah, they wanted to get off the bus and start walking around  Like they're homeless 
[00:35:30]  They're used to just walking around  We probably have about 40 people from, uh, from the station going as well  Yeah, yeah  A lot of people  There's like a caravan of just, uh, you know, uh, radio personnel  Following the bus  And, um, I hear, uh, we might have some pictures and, uh, whatnot  Uh, yeah  Oh, well, Steve is, uh, taking video  And we'll probably have 300 to 400 pictures of this  Great  When we're all, uh, done  But right now what you can do is go to opiananthony.com  And you can see the people that are joining us 
[00:36:00]  You can see the participants  It's their headshots  So when, when, when Blue goes back on the air and cries  You'll go, oh, there's Blue, that's what he looks like  Let me pop him up so you can get a little, uh, a little visual going  Right  There's Blue right there  Let's go back to the phones here  Chris, what's up?

Hey, what's up, guys? 
[00:38:00]  Alright  Uh, we're in the back of the middle of the bus  And, uh, Blue is just  Uh-oh, Blue is what?  Hello?  Hello, Blue's face  You like to marry?  Uh, Rick  You like to marry?  Rick, you broke up  We didn't hear what you said  Blue is doing what?  Rick  How is Mary?  Yeah  I guess Blue likes Mary  Blue is  I forgot Mary's on the bus  Alright, give me the phone back, thank you  Blue is hitting on intern Mary  What is she doing on that bus?  Typhoid Mary  Her new typhoid Mary  Oh, that's not funny! 
[00:38:30]  Hey, Rick  Rick, you were breaking up a little bit  Uh, so what?  Blue is making the moves on Mary?  Blue is  Blue is doing his, uh  His  Best  Best, uh  Uh, romance and  Spiel to Mary  And it seemed to be working  She was talking like crazy  Oh, I'm sure  Uh-oh, there he goes  She'll talk to anybody  Blue is going to the bathroom  What?  Blue, Blue is going to the bathroom  Where?  Where's he going?  He's headed to the bathroom  Oh, oh  He's  Well, there you go  The first homeless guy 
[00:39:00]  That is going to use the best  All right  Immediately  Rockin' roll, Tom  He's running around with a light  So I can't stand it  You know what it's going to smell like  When he opens that door back up  Homeless, uh, dumpster  Dumpster food dump  Is pretty much where  The fumes that are going to come out of that bathroom  Rick, what else is going on on the bus?  They're just kind of hanging out and waiting  Rick's breaking up  Rick's breaking up  He's taking another nap 
[00:39:30]  He's napping  They love napping, the homeless  Napping  Okay  Yeah, he's definitely out cold  And, uh, just  Looks like sperm is just chilling with snoop  All right  And making friends  That's nice  So they're more relaxed  And they're realizing  They're not going to get arrested, right?  Well  All right  Hey, Rick, your phone's crapping out  Kind of crappy  We'll try him in a minute or two  We're going to have a lot of that today  Because we've got just cell phones everywhere  Yeah  Uh, Frank, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show  What's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey  Funny, funny  Cool 
[00:40:00]  I was just thinking  When this bus pulls up to the mall  With all these guys passed out  Covered in excrement and urine  It's going to be like a boxcar  Rolling up to Auschwitz  I cannot believe that there is a bathroom  Uh, just a few seats away from anyone on that bus  Yet two of them already have decided  That they would rather sit in their own urine  Than get up and go to the bathroom  Or maybe they didn't realize they were going  Which is even more disturbing  But two of the homeless  Have already, uh, wet themselves 
[00:40:30]  In the seats  Well, when they pull up  And the mall security's there  It's going to be like the Nazi thumb guy  Telling them to get the hell out of there  Oh, well, we'll have to wait and see  It's going to get interesting from here on out  All right, guys  Great show  Keep it up, man  Thank you  Neil's got an observation  Let's go to Neil  Neil, what's up?  Hey, guys  How you doing?  All right  Great stuff  Thanks  I was thinking that  Based on the coordinates of the bus  That were last given  I think I just heard  A collective sigh of relief  From the New Jersey side of Manhattan  Well, you don't know for sure 
[00:41:00]  It might be a clever ruse  Clever ruse  Very nice  Very nice  That's a funny, funny observation  There was a little clue  That was given out  As to where the bus  What direction it was heading in  Still wide open  I think so  As to where they can be going  But, um  There's still a couple things  You could do from that area, right?  Oh, hell yeah  Hell yeah  All right  We've got to get to Psycho Mark  Take left, go right  All right  Thank you, Neil  Yeah, we might be doing  The muddle law thing, Anthony  Three rights make a lot 
[00:41:30]  Three rights make a left  Psycho Mark, what's up?  Boss in order  As far in front of the bus  As we could possibly be  So we can die first  If this thing crashed  I just went back there  Yeah, those two are not  Going to go to the back of the bus  I just went back there  I know one of them  I know Butter Roll  You know Butter Roll?  He hangs in front of the cellar  Every night  He's like an angry man  When you don't give him money  And he's so mellow right now  Right?  We're chatting and stuff  I think we're going to hang  After the whole thing's done  But Butter Roll  Sounds like a cool guy  He's like almost out of this 
[00:42:00]  Half of them are like sleeping  In a drunken stupor  Okay?  It's unbelievable  And I went back there  I gave him cigarettes and stuff  Yeah  And I'm talking recovery with them  And they're just staring at me  Like I'm some alien  Talking recovery with them  Fuck, there's one guy  One guy's sober  Like three months  Right?  Yeah  I think between all of them  There's four teeth  Right?  Yeah  So we don't have to worry  About any of them biting us  It's really scary  Yeah 
[00:42:30]  You know it's bad  When Voss is talking recovery to you  Yeah  Yeah  I knew  We can go to an AA meeting  And keep everybody busy for months  I knew the struggle  In the world  Hey, you guys  Get Jim Norton to call us in  Call in  No, no  Have him use his phone  You want to know  What a disgrace this is  Wow  Are you there?  Yeah, go ahead Jim  The guy blew into the bathroom  And everybody's like  Oh, let's go to the bathroom  Let's go to the bathroom  People on the bus are excited 
[00:43:00]  Because a homeless man  Is dropping the kids off in the pool  I am not happy to be on this bus  Oh my God  Listen to Voss  Hacking and coughing  If they don't have AIDS  He certainly does  That Voss can give some of them  A run for their money  Recovery with them in the back  And he's as drier drunk  Than anybody I've ever met  So it's going really well  All right  Have a good time  Just bed  Thank you  What's up, guys?  Hey, Ben  They're now demanding 
[00:43:30]  A stop at a liquor store  Uh-oh  Now, I saw  I saw a case of beer  At least one case  Under the front  One of the front seats  Of the bus  Yeah  I'm just wondering  If they've been allowed  To take part in the beer yet  I know they want to go  To a liquor store  That may be  We're trying to  I don't know  Because Tippi Tom yesterday  And I know why  They call him Tippi Tom now  He was on  A 45 degree angle  Backwards  Backwards  Where he could not walk  He was staring at the ceiling  Keith had to push  His shoulder blades forward 
[00:44:00]  Or the guy would have  Fallen right back  On the back of his head  I can only imagine  How many times  He has done that  On the streets  We're trying not  To give him too much beer  Before they get to the mall  Not until  It's got  It's got to be timed out  There's a formula here  You don't give them enough  They're not going to be themselves  Let's say  In the mall  You give them too much  And we're going to have a problem  So it's a fine line  Some of them might be able  To handle their booze  Others no  Right  Ziggy's going to need  A couple of beers  He hasn't said a word  He's napping  He's napping  He's going to be the star 
[00:44:30]  By the end of this  Yes  John what's up  Hey gentlemen  How are you  Good  Great great stuff  I mean real funny  I was thinking next year  To outdo this  How about getting a bunch  Of progeria kids  And taking them to  FAO Schwartz  For the holiday  Oh  Would that be great  Not bad  That's good  I'm going to jump around  On the keyboard  On the floor  Like in the movie Big  Yeah  Me and Tom Hanks  I'm going to play  That little song  I'm so light  That I can't even  Trigger the little  Sensors  So my part 
[00:45:00]  Never comes through  Hey Uncle John  What's up  And then my parents  Went to carry me  Out of FAO Schwartz  Once  And the security  Came running over  Because they thought  They were carrying  An E.T. doll  Out of the store  But it was me  Because I'm a regular kid  I look a little weird  Regular kid  You like to play baseball  Yeah I play baseball  Give me a glove  And a bat  I'm happy  Hey Uncle John  What's up  Hey guys  I just want to  Give a heads up  To these people  That are calling in  And saying this is wrong  And it's not right  And all that stuff  Yeah  You know these guys  Are going to make out 
[00:45:30]  Like they're  Two years ago  People were buying  Coats and clothes  Yeah now  That's another thing  We give them money  So they can go  And buy stuff  At the mall  But the people  The listeners of this show  That join them  At the mall  They go all out  I remember Ziggy  He was like a favorite  They were buying him  Sneakers  And a jacket  All of which  He got pounded on  Beat up on the street  So other homeless  Could steal it from him  But we're helping  The homeless economy  That way  He was able to keep  Some of the stuff  It puts newer goods  And services  Into the community 
[00:46:00]  That's what I want to say  To the malls  I'm telling you  A lot of our listeners  Are going to buy  A lot of stuff today  A lot of stuff  Don't you worry about it  And you know  The guy Snoop  Wants to come on the show  He's on the bus  From the last  Homeless shopping spree  There's only two  That were on the first one  Ziggy and this guy Snoop  Snoop is off the street now  Oh I know  He dresses better  Than you and I  You go to Snoop's picture  On the website there  Either one  What is it  OpieandAnthony.com  OpieandAnthony.com  Will work today  Yeah  You go to that  And plunk down Snoop 
[00:46:30]  That guy was  Almost two years ago  This guy was  Look at his watch  His sweater  His jeans  His jacket  Clean as a whistle  This guy  He took off his fancy  Shades that he was wearing  He's got a job  And last year  He was homeless  And he was on this  Homeless shopping spree  Two years ago  Yeah  And we met him  On the sidewalk  He goes  Guys I know  This is all about fun  And doing some cool radio  But I just want to tell you guys  That because of  The last time you did this  It set me straight man 
[00:47:00]  So something went wrong  With what we did  What's supposed to happen  Jesus Christ  I hate touching moments  Alright Uncle John  Thank you  Alright guys later  You know what this is like  What I realized  From two years ago  With Ziggy getting beaten up  And his clothing stolen  That he bought  At the mall  This is like  Our homeless  Economic stimulus package  You know  It's like we're giving  The community  Some stuff  That they can then  Beat up other people  For and take  And it works  It's way down the line 
[00:47:30]  It's the trickle down theory  That Reagan talked about  So many years ago  We're helping  We'll check in with Rick  Real fast  Then we have to take a break  Rick what's up  Hey no it's Keith  Hold on  Snoop wants to talk to you guys  Real quick  Snoop  Here's Snoop  Hey how you doing gentlemen  What's up Snoop  I just got a comment  To some of the negative  Callers that's been calling  You know  People fail to realize  That anybody needs help  Even the president  You know what I'm saying  And before 
[00:48:00]  I came to the show  I was doing bad  Just like Ziggy  And some of the other people  Peeing on themselves  In the streets  Yeah  You know  It's a shame  That people don't care  They forget where they come from  And that everybody needs help  All right  Look at that  All these negative people  Calling about these negative things  All right  He's breaking up  Right in the middle of his  Compassionate speech here Anthony  But basically saying  Because of this station and us  Yeah  He would  You know  If it wasn't for us  He'd still be on the street  Even though I'm still homeless  I don't have a job 
[00:48:30]  I'm in a job training program  You know  I still need help  Right  Yeah  Everybody does  You know  And that's the main focus  In this man-made society  People forget  Everybody needs help  All right  And it's a shame  It really is a shame  Cool Snoop  Well have fun today  All right  I will sir  Thank you  All right  And thank you  For all the caring people  Out there  Because you know  Everybody needs help  Once again  There you go  There it is  Thank you  Thank you  That will be the only  Serious moment of the show  Today Anthony  Enough of those speeches  Get back to the people 
[00:49:00]  That are crapping themselves  Please  All right  I'm assuming they're  They're out of Manhattan  At this point  Oh you would think  I'm thinking  Manhattan's safe  I think Manhattan is safe  I would think so too  You could rule out Manhattan  Yeah well  I think that was obvious  At this point  We could tell people  We did want to go down  Like Fifth Avenue  In Madison  Yeah but  Whenever we take a bus  Down there  There's trouble  Well I think the cops  Have had enough  Problems to deal with  So we want to  Just leave them alone  Ah 
[00:49:30]  This time around  That could be a hint  Right there too  My friend  Why?  I don't know  Want to leave the cops alone  What?  NYPD?  Well it's not Manhattan  Well it's NYPD's  In five boroughs  My friend  I'm just saying  It's not Manhattan  Okay  Alright  Do you know where we're going?

[00:51:30]  No way  You can play  Hide the hamster  On a one horse sleigh  Hey wait a moment  Holy shit  It's Christmas  Hey what happened to my lyric sheet  Anyone seen my lyrics  We don't need no lyric sheets  We know our parts by heart  Right fellas  Yeah sure  I know my parts by heart  Me too  Well that's great guys  I love Christmas songs 
[00:52:00]  Santa tried reaching out the neighbor's blouse  After drinking all the eggnog  Is that necessary  Camped out in the bathroom for an hour or two  Squashing off a eulog  Godfrey  We wandered in his undies all over the house  But we find it our own business  Till we caught something hamsters up and get trapped too  Holy shit it's Christmas  Santa comes just once a year  Up the chimney he'll disappear 
[00:52:30]  Keep on the lookout for Mr. Geer  Hamster's a little ring in the rear  Roast nuts chest and on an open parson  His tongue stuck to the doorknob  What?  His balls got funneled by a caroling choir  While the parson gave him a hint  What?  The sleigh came down and took him away  The whole damn crowd was dismissed  Because it's time to be dolly  And it's time to be gay 
[00:53:00]  Holy shit it's Christmas  Holy shit it's Christmas  Holy shit it's Christmas  Holy shit  Holy shit  It's Christmas  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  It's the 2001 homeless shopping spree  Oh my god  On the Opie and Anthony show  I'm gonna jerk off  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show 
[00:53:30]  It's homeless shopping spree too  And  Yes  The bus is loaded with ten  Very smelly homeless people  Yep  And they're on their way to the mall Anthony  What mall?  Hmm  We'll let you know 15 minutes before we get there  Rich Voss on the bus  What's up?  Where's Voss?  There he is  Hey Voss 
[00:54:00]  Hey Voss  I think your caller should take stock out in Fubu and Timberland  For when we get to the mall  This is gonna be a lot of purchasing  You know what I'm saying?  You think a lot of Fubu?  And Timberland  I think the stock's gonna go up once we get to the mall  If we get there without puking  What else is going on?  Are you guys stuck in traffic or anything?  Yeah we're stuck in traffic  People are driving by holding their nose  Oh really?  We're stuck in traffic  But they're pretty mellow  All the guys are pretty mellow  Yeah this is the calm before the storm 
[00:54:30]  Yeah they have settled down finally Anthony  I'm giving them cigarettes and stuff  You know it's kind of like prison  I'm buying them  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah  Buying favers  I give them a cigarette and then they owe me  Treats  It's going pretty good right now  It's pretty mellow  Yeah  No one's peeing themselves or screaming or yelling or anything  No fighting  No I noticed Rich that there's a lot of seats on that bus  More seats  A hell of a lot more seats than there are people  Are some of the homelesses buddying up and sitting next to each other  Even though there's plenty of seats for everyone? 
[00:55:00]  No I think they're all kind of alone  I think they compete  Because you know it's like when they're bumming money  They don't want to be next to each other  Right it kind of ruins it  Yeah so I think they're kind of like competing on the bus  They all want their own space and stuff  See because I think Tippi Tom and Rock and Roll Tommy  I kind of think of them as a team now  You know  They hate each other  But they hate each other  Well they're sitting close  See the funny thing is they're all taking their own seats  But everybody else we're all in one seat 
[00:55:30]  So we can keep away from them  I think  You know we're all squeezed up front right now  I see them like a comedy team  You know  Kevin's falling asleep right here  Look at this  He's dreaming  You can see like a big burger over his head  Here's Norton  Alright  Here's Jim Norton  Hello fellas  Hey Norton  What's up?  How you doing?  Defeated  Why?  Just because we're in bumper to bumper traffic  We're not moving  I have to take a dump  I can't do it here  Why can't you just go into that bathroom and crunch? 
[00:56:00]  I certainly will not do that  I'd rather do it in my pants like the one dude does when he gets arrested  I'm not going in that bathroom  I have to pee  I can't do it either  I'm just waiting until we get to the mall  I can't tell you how many people are writing in Norton saying you're going to start smoking any moment now  I will not  Mary's in the back drinking out of their mules to keep them quiet  It's horrific  Oh that's awful  Typhoid Mary  We're giving her like alcohol wubs and she's putting them on her tongue and gums 
[00:56:30]  Oh god  Just roll it back and watch pieces of beef jerky fall off  That's just awful  I'm just really hoping  Look, whenever you guys announce the mall  I'm just hoping some 17 year old will give me treats for tolerating this odor  Well you never know  Yeah you do know and it won't happen  Alright  Here's Ben  Ben  Nope 
[00:57:00]  I guess there is no Ben  Let's go to Rick  Hey Rick, what's up?  Hey guys  We're just about ready to sing a little Christmas carol  Oh good  I love this part  But I noticed that rock and roll Tommy in the back  He looks like he's about to light himself on fire  He's got a lit cigarette and an aerosol can  And he keeps turning it on right in front of his face  Here he goes again  Here he goes again  No, no, don't burn up anybody  Tommy, don't do that, dude  Why don't we take the aerosol can away from Rocky?  Yeah, how about that?  Can we get the aerosol can away from him before he explodes? 
[00:57:30]  Doesn't seem like that would be a good idea  No  Stop it  Hey Rick, how's the traffic?  How's the traffic?  The traffic is slow  Slow?  Slow, but we're moving in the right direction  Have you guys announced where we're going yet?  Hell no  You gotta tell us when you're about 15 minutes away  Alright, no problem  We should be there in about five, maybe seven minutes  As we get through this little traffic jam, we'll be fine  Although this is for Rusty, who checked in on instant feedback  Ouch  Oh  Are you answering in instant feedback? 
[00:58:00]  Well, he asked me a question and the answer is  Ouch  Okay  Alright, alright  Alright, guys, I think we're ready to sing  Alright, let's hear it  Oh, great  Alright, everybody  We're doing Deck the Halls  Page four, you ready?  Page four  And a one  And a two  And a  Deck the Halls  With  La la la la  La la la  La la la  La la la  Now it's a season to be jolly  La la la  La la la  La la la 
[00:58:30]  La la la  Good job, good job  Oh, my God  The only thing I can make that better is screeching tires and some explosion  I'll be homeless for Christmas  Alright, Rick, hold on a second  I gotta go to Ben real fast  Yeah, no problem  He's with Blue 
[00:59:00]  Uh, Ben  Hey, guys  What's up?  I'm here with Blue and, you know, we needed extra people to come on board today  So we brought up Matty, who works at the station  And Blue has been planted next to him the whole time  Yeah  And all he's doing now is scratching himself and itching himself all over the place  Every few seconds  I just got the heebie-jeebies from that  The guy, oh  He's got bugs  Opie, you said you left here last night itching  Uh, yeah, I was itching all the way home and when I got home last night  Ugh  Uh, Ben  Yeah  What else is going on on the bus? 
[00:59:30]  Uh, it's just, uh, everyone got into the singing  I saw Ziggy pipe up and get, they all got involved in that, uh, caroling  I think Ziggy should do a solo number because he does have that great voice  Yeah  Can we get a solo from, uh, Ziggy, Ben?  What's that?  Can we get a solo from Ziggy, possibly?  Yeah, Rick's right by, uh, Rick's with Ziggy right now, actually  All right, let's go to Rick, then  Let me go back to Rick  And we'll ask Rick  Hey, Rick  Rick  I know you were singing Deck the Halls  Do you want to sing one by yourself?  The guys want to hear you  I don't want to sing by yourself  You don't want to sing by yourself? 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, we're on top of the world  I know we're on top of the world, I understand  Yeah, he's afraid because we're up on a bridge  It looks very high  Oh, oh, oh, oh  Bridge, bridge, bridge  Another clue for you there  But we're far away from the city at this point  There you go, a little hint  Hey, Rick  Yeah  Uh, can we maybe even talk to Ziggy for a second?  I'm trying to get him to take the phone  Ziggy, you want to take the phone and talk to the guys?  Right here  Yeah, I'll hold it for you  Keith will hold it for you  There you go 
[01:00:30]  There you go, just talk to him when you're here  Hello, how are you?  Hey, Ziggy, how you doing?  Oh, you could answer on the telephone  What?  Who am I talking to?  This is Opie and Anthony, Ziggy  How are you?  Oh, Anthony?  Yeah  Oh, okay, we're just about making a landing now  You're making a landing?  We were all the way on top of the world  And there's a  Well, you've got to think  It doesn't get on a bridge  I'll give it to Keith  No, no, Ziggy, Ziggy 
[01:01:00]  Ziggy, are you listening?  I think he's done walking to you  Oh, God damn, he's homeless  Keith, does he really think he's in a plane?  Uh, yeah, he might  He thought  Because he hasn't been on a bridge in a vehicle probably ever  And he thought he was on an airplane  Because we're going to be landing soon  All right, well, sure  He thought they were flying  God damn, is that twisted  I would have loved to have gotten a little solo song out of Ziggy 
[01:01:30]  With his great rendition of Silent Night two years ago  I'll see how we can make that  I'll try and make that happen  And everyone behaving there, Keith?  Everyone is settled in and behaving, yes  Yeah, I just can't wait until they all got to get off that bus and get into that mall  It's going to be great  I'm looking forward to it  I'm sure you are  All right, Keith  All right, talk to you a bit  Thank you, there goes Keith  A couple instant feedbacks coming in, Anthony  Yeah  Dan from the city  I look at Snoop's picture  And I put my wallet in my front pocket 
[01:02:00]  And I'm in my living room  People checking out the pictures on opianthony.com  Most of the pictures will be up way later tonight or tomorrow, by the way  But we have just some face shots of the guys that are joining us today  Sarah from DC  What makes you guys any better than the talk shows you put down on exploiting the less fortunate?  What?  What makes us different, I wouldn't say better, is the fact that we're not making believe we're doing something good here  Absolutely not  You know, they go on those shows and the hosts of the shows are like, hey, we're helping 
[01:02:30]  Please, we just think it's hysterically funny to get a bunch of homeless guys and take them to a mall  And if something worthwhile comes out of this, great  Fine  If not, oh well  Rick, what's going on?  Hey guys, I'm sitting right here with Tippi Tom  Uh-oh  Yeah  I know his eyes are closed and he looks asleep  He's scratching himself incessantly and he's cuddled up with a chicken sandwich that he got from Hard Rock Cafe  Oh, that's how they keep their food warm 
[01:03:00]  I'm serious, I took a couple pictures, we'll have them up on the website later  Hey, hey, uh, Rick  Yeah  Put the phone by his mouth and then knock him on the head a couple of times  Alright, hold on  Don't touch his hair  I'm hearing it could be contagious  I swear to God  Listen to it  I don't know you  Go  No, come on  What are you  Come on  Oh my God  Rick, what happened? 
[01:03:30]  He's all pissed off  He's all pissed off because I woke him up  He's all pissed off  Where you at?  He's all pissed  Listen to him  Alright  Go  Go  Go  Go  Go  Go  Go  Go  Have a seat  Have a seat  Let him start it up  Yeah, don't start it up  Don't underestimate  The power  The power 
[01:04:00]  Oh, he's ripping off  He's ripping off  He's ripping off  Hallelujah  Hallelujah  No  No  Rick, what's going on?  Blue is standing up making a statement  Oh, he is?  Don't touch the power  Yeah, he said  Don't touch the power  Of the big, big blue  There you go  The power of the big, big blue  I think he's taking your line  Don't underestimate the psychofactor in my head  Well, that's Jay Moore's line now, Anthony  Alright, Rick, thank you 
[01:04:30]  Alright, guys  Alright  Oh, how funny is it that Rick does what I said  Knocks him on the head  And the guy just loses his mind  Don't effing wake me up  I don't know you  I don't know you  Andy, what's up?  Andy  Hey, man  Alright, you only get one shot  We gotta move around here  Ben, what's up?  Hey, guys  Well, last Friday's show did nothing to stop our crew from smoking cigarettes  The bus is filled with cigarette smoke at this point  And whatever happened  I was in the front of the bus 
[01:05:00]  So I missed what happened with Tiffy Tom  But he just threatened to kill me  And I was in the front of the bus  Get all of you  Make your hands up  You woke up the wrong motherfucker  Whoa, wait, whoa  Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait  Tiffy Tom's yelling  You woke up the wrong mother ever  Hold on, hold on, hold on  Alright, hold on, hold on  Hold on  We had to dump out again  Holy Jesus, he's lost his mind 
[01:05:30]  Losing his ass on the bus  Remind him we're giving him money  And he'll be shopping  And it'll be great  Ben  Tom, we're gonna give you money  You're gonna go shopping  We're gonna have a good time  What time is it?  What time is it?  What time is it?  What time is it?  Like he's got an appointment  He's wondering what time it is  I don't know  Yeah, well wait a second  I was supposed to get 20 bucks  Yesterday  You got the 20 bucks  You got the $100  When you're worried about 20 bucks  You got the 20 bucks 
[01:06:00]  No, I got a bottle of liquor  I got drunk  Now he's arguing over money yesterday  It's very funny  Because he's sitting right in front of Ziggy  And Ziggy, you know  Is very well behaved here  Right behind him  And Tom is just going nuts  Screaming and yelling at anyone that walks by  Now he's yelling at Steve and Keith  Ben, who is the most freaked out on the bus?  Most freaked out?  Well, Blue is really freaked out  As far as our staff goes  Jim Norton is definitely freaked out 
[01:06:30]  Probably Jim Norton, I would say  Without a doubt  And Mary  Because Mary keeps getting hit on  Like crazy by Blue  They were sharing cigarettes  They were having cigarettes together  Well, not sharing them  But they open up a pack  And they're talking  And Blue just keeps looking at her  With a big smile  He's sitting  Mary's sitting on one side  But Blue's sitting  You know, in the next  Right  Over from the aisle  He has not moved  Since his whole episode earlier  So he likes Mary  You know how many batches  He's going to slam out  With her in his head? 
[01:07:00]  Oh, God  Bunch of homeless batter  I bet  Now rock and roll Tommy  Screaming back here  What's up, Tommy?  I'm going into an alcoholic seizure  Yeah, Tommy's complaining  He wants booze  But he's rocking out  He was showing me earlier  His cheap trick CD  And how he looks like Robin Xander  He looks like Robin Xander  If they were in a plane crash  What is he talking about?  An alcoholic seizure  He's going into an alcoholic seizure  What's the alcoholic seizure about, Tommy?  I'm going below .8 
[01:07:30]  He needs some booze  I'm going below .8  You know what?  He's not bad  You could probably give him a beer  God  We can do that  Do we have the breathalyzer on the bus?  That would have been a good thing  Give just one guy the beer  Just give rock and roll Tommy the beer  And don't give the other one  Yeah, just give one to Tommy  I want to see how this goes  It's like throwing a steak to one tiger  Right  Ben  Yeah  Give him a beer  Just him though  Just give him a beer  Yeah  All right  Hang on  This is great 
[01:08:00]  It's like we're able to play with human beings  I like seeing what happens  It's like a test subject  All right  I'm waiting  I know  He's getting the beer  Yeah  I know where the beer is  Yeah, again  See, I'm the way in the back  Yeah, I know  Yeah  That's the way in the front  I'm still back here with  With rock  I go to the head of the class  What did he say?  He's in the head of the class  He just told me  I go to the head of the class 
[01:08:30]  He's going to the head of the class, Anthony  Okay, Mark is here  Hang on  Let me turn it over to Mark  Gerard's checking in  Gerard's checking in  Gerard  What do you want me to do?  You want me to tantalize him?  No!  Keep going  Oh, I can't  What happened?  Wait, hold on a second  Keith's telling me really not to do this  It's a bad idea  If we start giving him booze  The rest of them are going to go bananas  That's what I want  That's what we want  I want  No, I want just him to get a beer  And none of the other guys  Keith is looking at me right now 
[01:09:00]  Saying, absolutely not  Get Keith on the phone  Get Keith on the phone  Dude, this is like The Sims  There has to be a certain sense of control  Keith, we just want to give one beer  To the rock and roll topics  Keith, just give him one beer  Let me ask you a question  Yeah  Don't you think that the theory applies  That if one gets  Everybody's going to want  That's what we want  That's what we want  That's what we want  That's what we want to hear  Were we not all in the studio together yesterday?  But just give him one beer 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, I know how it is  Yeah, yeah  You know what?  You guys are like the dealers that I like  Just one, man  It's all right  Just have one  The next thing you know  We're going to hold off for a little while longer  I guess they didn't like our idea  Oh, damn it  Okay  Let's just put it this way  Keith, when you finally start handing out the beer, right?  Right  You've got to give one beer to rock and roll Tommy first  So we can get the reaction  And then you can hand it out  Oh, great  Inciting a riot  I want to hear all of them freak out  Oh, sure 
[01:10:00]  That's not because you're there  Right  I'm here keeping control  Exactly  Won't that be great?  All right, hold on a second, man  I've got to go to a couple people  Gerard, real quick, from Boston  Says, Ziggy thinking he's flying  Is one of the funniest things I've ever heard  Ziggy and the bus going over the bridge  He looked down, saw it like the water  And just thought he was on a plane  It's like, we're on top of the world  We're landing now  Adam, what's up?  Landing  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, man  All right  Hey, when Ziggy was complaining 
[01:10:30]  And thinking that he was on the plane  The layers thing  I'm telling you  If you play it back  He sounds just like Ozzy  And if Norton gets a little bit too distraught  Just have Ziggy talk to him  And he can close his eyes  And pretend he's Ozzy  Crinkle, crinkle  Crinkle, crinkle  All right, Adam  Thank you  Yeah  All right, well  Poor Mary  Mary's like the only girl on this bus  And they're hitting on her  She got spit on yesterday  As Tippy Tom was yapping about something  A big piece of spit 
[01:11:00]  Flew out of his mouth  And hit Mary on the arm  I think she'd have rather been struck  By hot lead  Than that guy's spit  Because she freaked out  I think you could see scratches  Where she scrubbed herself with a brillo  Lena from Boston  Holy yes, guys  I want you to have these guys  Take pictures on Santa's lap  Oh, we'll definitely do that  We did that last time  It's a wonderful photo op for the guys  And you can imagine these guys  Trying stuff on  And then putting it back on the rack  Who is going to end up  Wearing things they have tried on 
[01:11:30]  Ernie from Jersey said  This is great  We get to play with human beings  I think Dr. Mengele said that too  No, it's like a little test subject  A little test environment  That goes along  With basic primal human nature  Jay, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey  Hey, you know what you guys should do?  You know what you're saying?  You're going to get close to these guys?  Yeah  You guys should take them to the bed and bath store  And have them get all cleaned up  And give them little smelly soaps  And stuff like that  Well, they're going to go wherever they want  Yeah  Maybe they'll head over there 
[01:12:00]  Because, I mean, it sounds like  Your little friends over there  Saying that that place smells like a dumpster  Or something like that  You should score for a few  And see what they do  Well, there'll be plenty of people  Probably going to the cologne counters  And whatnot  There you have it  Sure  All right, why don't we take a break  Because I have a feeling  When we come back from break  Yeah  We'll be able to announce them all  Oh, do you think so?  I have a feeling, yeah  We'll get them on the phone  We'll see if they think  They're close enough  Okay  And then maybe we'll have an announcement  All right, it's the Homeless Shopping Spray 2

[01:19:00]  While I'm standing here with Rick  Rick, let me just say a couple words to you  Three of them  As a matter of fact  Oh, wait a minute  No, no  This is legal, right?  Four words  This is legal  Remember those four words, Rick?  Remember where the two guys on the phone were sitting when those four words came out?  Oh, come on  It was pure logistics  As a consultant to the show, I'm going to say  We're going to hold off on the beer a little bit longer  Oh, this sucks  Only because I happen to know the ten people that we have in the back of this bus 
[01:19:30]  I know, but all we're saying is  Just give Rock and Roll Tommy one beer  And then when they all want to have one  Then we'll give them the rest  Oh, good  Before we get there  Great idea  Great idea  How much damage could one beer each do?  Trust me  Trust me  That's why we want to do it  I know  Trust me  Keith  Let's just hold off on him for a little bit longer  But you're almost there  I understand that  And that's the beauty of it 
[01:20:00]  We're almost there  All right, put Rick back on the phone  There's no talking to you for some reason  I don't understand Keith being the responsible one today  I know  Psycho Mark, what's up?  What's going on?  I'm sitting back here with Tommy right now  He looks like a pit bull waiting to fight somebody  He wants to take the bus over  He's growling  Oh my God  All right, let me go to Ben

Good, three, Nick  What the hell was that?  Three, Nick  Whatever he said  What the hell was that?  What the hell was that?  Well, I don't know what he even said  I don't know  He looks puzzled  Oh, God  It just smells like, uh, like, uh, pee 
[01:23:00]  Ask him, ask him if he's excited about the shopping that he's about to do  Ziggy, are you excited about the shopping you're going to do?  I mean, I didn't realize  I didn't see you again  I was up with that before  Ben, Ben  Ask him if he has any clue where he is  Ziggy, do you have any clue where you are?  Yeah, wrong arm or something  Oh, wow, all right  He knows where he is  A little more coherent than we thought, isn't it?  There you go  All right, he knows he's on Long Island somewhere  Ask Ziggy, ask Ziggy if he needs a beer, Ben  Ziggy, do you want a beer? 
[01:23:30]  I don't know if everybody else will have one or another  Listen to him  I'm telling you, he's the man  I don't think there'd be a problem  I want to talk to, um, rock and roll Tommy  Okay, here he is  Rock and roll Tommy  Yes, can I have my beer now, please?

Because I want to time out this break here  Um, we've got about one more mile  Then we're going to get off the expressway  Yeah  And, uh, Keith is still frowning 
[01:24:30]  Very, very disapprovingly  At the idea of giving them beer  I'm working, I'm working on Keith  I'm not getting anywhere, though  One beer each is not going to cause them to, uh, go crazy  Keith, one beer each  They'll, they'll finish it by the time we get there  Everybody will be in a festive holiday mood  What do you think?  One beer  Yes  One  There you have it  Let the homeless drink  Let the homeless drink  Let the homeless drink  Let the homeless drink  Let the homeless drink  All right, here we go

[01:32:30]  It's going to be brutal  Alright thank you  Let me go to Jimmy  Mall security at the mall Anthony  Oh really  Jimmy  Are you at Roosevelt Field Mall?  Yeah  What's up Jimmy?  Jimmy?  Yeah what's up?  Yeah they just called me back into work  I'm a security guard at Roosevelt Mall  They got  They got a clamp down on you guys  Like how?  They're not going to let you guys go in  And what is going to be their  They're going to watch the exits for the buses  And they're going to have the cops check the bus on you guys  What's going to be the reason?  I have no idea  I have no idea  They just called us all back 
[01:33:00]  Did they call a red alert?  They told me to get back and guard the gate  Is it true they called a red alert Jimmy?  Yes  Red alert  It says there's a red alert down here  What does a red alert entail?  It's like high security  They just don't want  They think you guys are going to go crazy in the mall  Jimmy is there something higher than a red alert?  I have no idea  This is the first time I heard of it  I mean people with guns should be a red alert in the mall  A terrorist invasion is a red alert  I got a pencil neck thick running around screaming and yelling at us 
[01:33:30]  Not to let you guys in at all  Haven't people been listening to the show?  We're going to behave ourselves today  I hope so  I think it's great man  I'm even going to give some bucks to the homeless  Alright thank you Jimmy  Let's go to Kevin  The bus is checking in  We'll get to him in a second here  Kevin what's up?  Hey what's up  Hey  I'm at the mall right now  Yeah  There are mounted cops on horses  Stop it  There's no  Helicopters  Yeah sure 
[01:34:00]  There's no way  I swear to God  Get out of here  There's no way  There's a helicopter  There's no way there's a helicopter  And police on horses  Helicopter  Where's uh  Look let's get to the bottom  Alright let's go right to Ben  Oh Rick's checking in too here  Ben what's up?  Ben  They're jamming our frequencies Opie  Let's go to Rick  Rick what's up?  Hey guys what's happening  We're about a mile away  Do you see any cops Rick?  I see no police  I see no helicopters  I don't know what this guy's talking about  Of course 
[01:34:30]  I think they're just making us freak out a little bit  Everyone likes doing that  Because anytime we do something  People always talk about all the cops that are there and showing up  And the only time it was true was when everyone got arrested  This is kind of like that Apollo mission when it had to go around the  What was it the sun?  Oh the moon  Oh the moon  And we lost  Loss of signal  Loss of signal in communications with the Apollo  Right  And now we're just holding our breath hoping that we can get into the mall here  Yeah  So Rick what's going on on the bus? 
[01:35:00]  Right now we're just pretty much gathering up all our stuff  Because we're coming up to the main entrance of the mall  Everybody's making sure they've got their phones  We've got the cameras all set  Everybody's making sure that they've accounted for their homeless  The homeless have been assigned  Right  To different people  I don't know if you want me to go through who's got their homes  No no no no  Hold on a second  Rick hold on for one second  There's a lady on a roof  Sue what's going on?  Hi I'm on the roof of Bloomingdale 
[01:35:30]  Yeah  And I'm parked up here  There's no security up here  But there's definitely  There was a helicopter in the sky  And I see yellow flashing lights  By that big Charles Lindbergh statue  When you drive in  Okay  And I'm just waiting for the bus  I'm doing my work  And I was in the area circling the mall  Thinking and hoping you'd stay Roosevelt Field  Yeah  And here I am  So I'm waiting  There's a lot of entrances to the mall  I can't imagine they could block every entrance Anthony  Of course  The roof of Bloomingdale  Is always a good place to park 
[01:36:00]  Yeah  So I'm up here  Well thank you Sue  You're welcome  Thank you  If you see anything calls back  Well I'm going to keep you on hold for a minute  Hold on  Alright Sue's on the roof Anthony  Let's go to Bob  Bob what's up?  Hey can't you guys abort the mission  And head over to an undisclosed location  Another mall?  No  The fun of this is to have our listeners help the homeless  Right  You know we only gave you guys like a 10 minute head start  That's 10 minutes too much my friend  Yeah that's what we're starting to figure out  But alright  Thank you Bob 
[01:36:30]  Alright bye bye  Let me go to Ed  Ed what's up?  Hey what's up guys?  Hey  Hey  Ed's inside the mall  You're in the mall Ed?  Yeah listen  I just walked outside the door  There's security not that high at all  The mall looks normal  Nobody has a clue  There you go  Of course  I think people are trying to panic us  I just walked out by Sam Goody  And there's nothing going on here  There's a couple of cops walking around  But nothing extraordinary  See people are trying to freak us out  Yeah I did see a helicopter when I came in 
[01:37:00]  But I think that was just passing by  Coincidence  Let me go back to Rick  Thank you Ed  Let's talk to Rick on the bus  Rick what's up?  Hey guys what's happening?  Hey  We're just coming  Like I said we're just hitting up like every light it seems  Before we get to the mall  But we're coming up fast  A lot of people following the bus at this point?  Yeah we've had plenty of idiots almost side swipe us  And then drive themselves into a tree  Which is always a nice treat  But it seems to have calmed down right now  Since we hit some traffic and some lights  Alright 
[01:37:30]  Alright hold on  I'm going to check in with Ben  Hold on  Alright so they're stuck in traffic Anthony  And some lights there  Ben what's up?  What's up guys?  Hey  That phone sucks  Yeah Ben your phone blows  Ron's checking and saying  I was at the Lincoln Tunnel  And saw them pulling back the National Guardsmen  Putting them on Humvees  And heading to Long Island  And there are reports that NORAD is scrambling fighters  To head to the mall 
[01:38:00]  People stop it  Roosevelt Field Mall on Long Island  Rick what's up?  Hey what's happening guys?  We're just stuck in a little bit of traffic  Just before the mall  The holiday shoppers  And probably a good portion of our listeners  Are tying up things to try and get there  Yeah okay  Did you want me to go through  Who's got what homeless guy or whatever?  No no that's alright  Alright  You know what Rick?  Hold on  Someone's going to pick you up  And as soon as you see the mall  We're going to go right back to you alright? 
[01:38:30]  No problem  Someone talk to them  And we'll go through some of these calls in the meantime  Aaron what's up?  What's up guys?  Hey  On my way to the mall right now  I'm about two blocks away  I just want you guys to know  Cops on horseback is totally normal at the mall  Totally normal  Totally normal  That's nothing like out of the ordinary  We promise we're going to behave  Right Anthony?  Right  That's a good thing  I hope not  Look there's nothing anyone can do  It's just a shopping trip  And people that try to scare us 
[01:39:00]  Are being very silly  Yeah that's not nice  Dude let me tell ya  Psycho Mark what's up?  Hey what's up?  These guys are so excited to go shopping  Hey we want more beer before we go shopping  They want more beer before they want to go shopping  They want an extra road trip so to speak  Yeah they want one more beer Anthony  Before they leave the bus  Oh well should we give it to them?  It's up to them at this point  I was just told we don't have any more beer  We're going to have to pick them up  Yeah sure  I saw at least the case 
[01:39:30]  That old guy  Don't tell them  How close are you right now?  We're real real close  Yeah  We're going to get right in the mall  What are you kidding me?  What are we going to do to us?  Please come on  We're just having fun  Of course  You know this is America  People forget about that  We live in America  You know just because a couple smelly people are on a bus  And they're drunk  Who cares?  Are you guys stuck in traffic  Because someone is reporting  There's an accident just past the mall  Yeah the traffic is brutal 
[01:40:00]  I mean it's crawling along  We're right here on Old Country Road  That's where the cops and helicopters are from  Hold on hold on a second  Yeah because Dennis has got some good info here  Dennis what's up?  Hey what's up there boys  Yeah I've been sitting here at a certain entrance of the mall  And whenever it was saying cops were running  There was an ambulance and everything  That went down the opposite way down Old Country Road  And that was that  Ah okay  Horseback true  Helicopter circling overhead true  But now it disappeared  And there's about 30 to 40 people jockeying for position 
[01:40:30]  To try and follow this bus  Oh really?  It is effing hysterical  People are sitting up  They're tailgating  I'm waiting to see a hibachi out here  Well this is  It's quite an event  When the homeless bus actually pulls up  It's such a sight to behold  All the fans there  That's quite exciting  You're going to be hearing honking and screaming  Like Ozzy just walked in  Nice  Well he did  His name is Ziggy this week  Ozzy  Alright  Dennis thank you 
[01:41:00]  No problem brothers  That is the deal right there  We got to the bottom of where the cops were going  Yeah  Sue on the roof  Sue  Hi guys  Hi  You know I don't see the bus yet  But you know what's funny  There's a big office building next to the mall  And the number is 666  Oh yeah  And it's just blowing overhead  Waiting for the bus to come  Of course  But I'm looking forward to meeting Ziggy  Personally  Maybe we'll sing a duet  You know I'll definitely catch up with the gang later  Are you going to check them out  Oh absolutely  Absolutely  We're going to go put on makeup  Yeah Ziggy's the man

Schwartz  Right now Ziggy's looking at a women edition G.I. Joe doll  And some Harry Potter stuff at the moment  Oh Ziggy's a Harry Potter fan  Yeah you know he's looking around  He looks like one of the workers from the bank scene  I didn't see it but  I can only imagine  Someone out there is chuckling  One of the other funny points of this whole thing  As the downstairs of the mall is completely packed 
[02:37:00]  Mark screams down from the upper level  Gak Gak Gak Gak  About as loud as you can imagine  People just looking horrified  Great  Right on  What a way to spend the holidays guys  Alright  Ben speaking of Psycho Mark  We've got to check in with him  Because he's finally has decided to shop at his homeless guys  Yeah  Mark  I'm going to shop with Tommy  He's so drunk he can't even read the CDs  He just picked up a copy of F.J.A.C.E.

[02:38:00]  Uh  Three shots of Absolute and a couple of Heineken's man  Hey what do you think of Mark?  Who's Mark?  I hate to introduce myself formally to me  Yeah  But uh Mark is a very respectable man  You are a nut  Alright  That's good enough  Ira what's up?  Guys this is the greatest thing I have ever seen in my 26 years of life on this earth 
[02:38:30]  The looks on these people's faces are priceless  They are priceless  They are horrified  They are disgusted  And F you to all those stores that would not even let them shop  Yeah some of the stores sticks in the mud  They pulled the grate down and didn't let them shop  But the one thing you guys have to do next  Send them to the Islander game  Not a bad idea  I might have to call Ted over there at the Islander's office 
[02:39:00]  Alright man we gotta check in with a few more people  Thanks Ira let's go to Big Kev  Big Kev what's up?  Hey guys what's up?  Hey man  I'm here with Butterall and Youngblood  And one of the listeners Carl  Decided to take them to the shopper image  And buy them anything they wanted under $50  Oh yeah that's pretty cool  Yeah so Butterall has got a fist full of batteries  For his radio  And a collapsible umbrella  Nice 
[02:39:30]  And Youngblood is still  He's searching among the electronic items  I saw Youngblood before he got on the bus  Perhaps you ought to recommend that nose and ear hair trimmer  Alright man  Thank you Big Kev  Sorry about that I didn't mean to do that  We gotta check in with Norton  Norton what's up?  We're in a Macy's and they're buying pants for one of our  I don't know where my guys are  Kevin has them and let him have them  Norton's disgusted by this whole thing  There's 500 potential rapists standing in a circle 
[02:40:00]  And there's a homeless man trying on clothes in the middle of the store  He removed his trousers  He did a striptease  I actually got a rod it was pretty nice  And he's trying on pants  And once you try them on I would suggest the store just letting him keep them  Yeah regardless of the price  So that's who we are  There's about 300 people down there  We have 500 people just screaming and causing a ruckus  And everybody in the store is extremely nervous  I'm not with them believe me if the cops come in  So I'm just kind of standing back here  Right see that's what he's doing  My mule on chicks were standing in front of me 
[02:40:30]  So it's going well and the guys are moving his clothes in the middle of the store  But I don't think anybody can see it because everybody is surrounding this man in a circle  So the last time I think a black guy was surrounded by this many white people  He was on an auction block dancing  Oh god damn  Holy Jesus  I'll see you guys later  Let's check in with Rick  Hey guys we just left Sam Goody  Yeah  With Big Ed and Big Blue  And Big Blue was dancing, singing, thanking everyone in the store 
[02:41:00]  Because he just got himself a big boombox  Oh yeah?  And he's just excited  Right Blue, Blue you got the boombox  How do you like that man?  Excuse me  Yeah I got boombox, who this I'm talking to?  ONA  I don't hear nothing  Hello?  I don't hear nothing, he's deaf, why is he getting a boombox?  He can never hear us  No he can't  They all get nervous when Blue starts running  And also we gotta thank a lot of the listeners who helped chip in 
[02:41:30]  Because we didn't have enough money to get them this boombox  And they chipped in a bunch of cash  Ah that's cool, see that our listeners  To make the season brighter for Big Blue  Cool  Our listeners not quite the scum everyone thinks they are  Hey Rick  Yo  We're gonna wrap up pretty soon because we gotta end the show  Alright you got it man, we're just gonna get Big Ed some sneakers and then we're out of here  Alright cool, thank you  Alright, bye  The homeless shopping spree too  Coming to an end in about 15 minutes here Anthony  Ben, what's up? 
[02:42:00]  What's up guys, we're just denied access to our Marnie exchange  As they saw Ziggy walking up  So we're heading towards Sharper Image at the moment where Ziggy might pick something up  But we love when he tries on the suits  I know  Total dicks man, total dicks  What do you think Ziggy might want at the Sharper Image, a Razor rollerboard scooter?  I don't know, Ziggy hasn't really been in the shopping mood  I mean he bought some essential stuff  I think he could use the Ionic Breeze air purifier and just put it in his pants 
[02:42:30]  In his pants  Purify that stench  Sharper Image, a big client of the Opie and Anthony show  And the homeless guys seem to gravitate toward the Sharper Image store  There you go  Alright Ben, thank you  Alright, they're running out of energy obviously  Ryan, what's going on?  Hey, what's up man?  Nothing funnier than watching Big Blue in a massage chair in Brookstone  It was absolutely, totally  Were the people in the store just horrified that he was smudging up their equipment? 
[02:43:00]  And he's looking at a radio and there's an old lady just shopping for the same radio  Had no idea what was going on  I'll take the one the homeless guy wanted  Alright guys, take it easy  A lot of the listeners that were there had a great time  Anthony, a few things  You go to opianthony.com, you can get the face shots of all the guys that went shopping today  And keep checking back because I know Steve C was there videotaping  Everyone was taking pictures, digital pictures  So we'll have those up as quick as we can  And you'll be able to follow along

Wow!  What a day!  I'm waiting, someone's calling in here  I'm just waiting to go to them  Not a very successful shopping spree  Alright, we'll go to Seattle  Jeremy, what's up?

Alright, thank you Jeremy  And I got a message for Norton too 
[02:44:30]  Yeah  It sucks  Alright, thank you  Bye, later fellas  Much from Allentown's gotta add a little taste of reality to this whole thing  You know that boombox is gonna be stolen within five minutes of him hitting the street  Isn't that awful?  Ah, Jack, what's going on?  The war out there  Jack  Hey  Hey, great unfunny show  I tell you, you guys are the most unfunniest people I've ever heard  I mean, I try to like listen to the morning programs  Which are much better than your unfunny afternoon program  But I have to tell you, you just ate the cake 
[02:45:00]  It's just so unfunny  Hey Jack, Jack, it's so smart of you to call up on one of our best shows ever  And try to pull that by us  Oh really, it's unfunny  I mean, you guys are just great at being unfunny  If you're gonna be great at something  Be great at being unfunny  Jack, keep listening then  Keep listening  Every day just like you do  I do, I compare you to the morning shows that I like listening to  God only knows what morning show he likes  Oh, he probably thinks snorting  Right, exactly  Exactly  With his drivel  Wonderful  A little tip to the people that hate us 
[02:45:30]  Yeah  Like pick a day when we really suck  Yeah, there's plenty of those  Oh, there are plenty of those days  Then you call in and tell us how unfunny we are  Yeah  And then it'll get to us  But a day like this, you're wasting your dime  It's a great fun show today, absolutely  Freaking loser  Trying to ring on our parade, Opie  Not today  Yeah, this was obviously a very unfunny show  Steve, what's up?  Hey man, what's up?  Hey  We just walked out of foot action with Tippi Tom  I'm with Matty  And  Gotta give a big thanks to foot action  They hooked him up with some really, really nice boots 
[02:46:00]  Tippi Tom is littered with bags of socks and clothes  Stylin'  Yeah, he's really stylin' now  Stylin'  Well, slow down  Stylin'  Yeah, but he was dancing  He's dancing and randomly breaking into Christmas carols too  We have no idea where Ben is  We were with Ben for a little bit  And Ben, I think he freaked out with Ziggy and went somewhere else  Well, Ziggy was a star, so it's kind of a little more pressure on Ben  I think so, I think so  It seems like you  You want to say something? 
[02:46:30]  Yeah  Here you go  Who am I talking to?  That's Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony, how are you?  I wanted to meet you the other day  Well, you were in here for quite some time, Tippi  You met us  There's no idea he met us yesterday  Oh God, I was hammered  You weren't there when I was there  Right, we weren't there  Exactly  It was on our show, but we weren't there  He did the whole show with us yesterday  The guy from KISS was there though  The guy from who?  The man KISS 
[02:47:00]  KISS  He remembers Gene  He remembers Gene being in the studio, but not Opie and Anthony  Hey Tom, did you get some good stuff?  Yeah  Well, happy holidays there, Tom  I feel like a celebrity  Well, you are a celebrity today, my friend  No, stop it  All right, man  We're going to let you go  We're going to let you go  Can you hear everybody?

Tommy's yelling at everybody in the CD store  He's yelling so much his teeth popped out and fell on the floor  He's yelling and screaming  I'm like, come on, hurry up, let's go  Yeah, that's not funny  We got Andre in the shoes  We got him some new tibolins  Oh, you did?  Yeah, he got some fresh tibolins so we can go back to 14th and kick some ass  And Andre is almost about done  He almost whipped his junk out and rubbed it against the 70s rock collection over here 
[02:48:00]  Well, thank God that didn't happen  Oh, God, thank you  Well, I'll say that again  Well, I think they're going to start leading them out  Yeah, I think we're going to get them out of the mall now  Mark is trash  You can tell  Mark is trash  Kevin, what's up?  Hey, guys  Hey  Oh, and hey  To answer that guy earlier, it's not that you guys aren't funny  It's just that you're unbelievably unoriginal  Oh, okay  Of course, this has never been done before  Who did the homeless shopping spree?  Oh, Jesus, guys 
[02:48:30]  Okay  Stop fooling yourselves  Okay  For Christ's sake  Thank you, Kevin  Oh, you know something?  You're right, I will  Yeah  I'm going to stop fooling myself  You know how ridiculous this sounds?  Especially today with someone taking what's in my pants and doing it today  Yeah, exactly  Don't worry about it  Then don't listen  I never understand the people that call up  It's like, why call up?  Just stop listening  Easy  I will tell you, the show sounds so good that they're pissed off  Yeah, I think that's  Yeah  It pisses them off  You mean someone else out there could actually do good radio? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah  Ben, what's up?  Hey guys, what's going on?  What's happening?  I brought Ziggy into a very nice men's room where he's gone into a stall and I think he's  going to be in there for a while  He came in and it was like a kid going F.A.O. shorts for the first time  He was so excited  That's great  Like paradise  Like when Dorothy opened the door of the house and walked out into a land of color in  Oz, right?  Yeah, totally  Unbelievable  Alright Ben, you should wrap everyone, well round everyone up and get them out of there 
[02:49:30]  because we've got to close the show, man  Yeah, we're right at the exit  Ziggy wanted to take a dump and I figured why not do it in style and then we'll get on the bus  Alright cool, thanks Ben  Alright, okay  Anthony, with that why don't we take a break and we'll wrap up Homeless Shopping Spree 2 next  Alright  Playback  bowl  1  3  2  3  4  2  3  3  1

[02:51:00]  Ding-fi-da-dun  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show  Yeah  Home of shopping spree too  Huge success  Oh my god  At the Roosevelt Field Mall  It had everything, didn't it?  A little bit of drama, a little danger  There when they were pulling in  We weren't sure, Rick sounded like the Rick from the Voyeur bus  For a little while there  And then they got off the bus 
[02:51:30]  Entered the mall to just hundreds of people cheering them on  And they bought stuff  And people bought stuff for them  And the ones with Psycho Mark drank until they fell down  And spit their teeth out in the CD store  What a great day  I want to thank the mall for not being tools  Yeah, the mall itself was great  There were a couple of stores that were a little bit tool-ish  Psycho Mark, what's going on? 
[02:52:00]  Oh, he's not down  Oh, crap  There we go  Psycho Mark  I can't hear him  Let's go to Rick  Hey, Rick, what's up?  Hey, guys  We are out front where we started  In front of Houlihan  And it's just been an emotional time  As Big Blue and Tippi Tom  Have been making speeches to the crowd  To let them know how much they appreciate  Everything they've done for them today 
[02:52:30]  Oh, great  Oh, they've broken up to Rudolph  Everybody  He's out of town  And if you ever saw him  You could even stay in close  All of the other Rangers  You still have to call him names  They never let Cor Rudolph  Come on, Brady  All right  Now they forget the words 
[02:53:00]  Oh, yeah  So, Rick  Hello  They're getting back on the bus  The bus  The bus is about to arrive  So everybody's  Out here  Fans of all day  Upstairs  Cheering  Throwing down  It's just  An incredible  Collier  Holiday  Action  Let's hear it for the homeless 
[02:53:30]  Let's hear it for the homeless  They cheer as long as it's not them who's homeless  Right  Heftard Mike said he learned that Houlihan's is under construction  After all that, that's what he learned  That's what he learned  Sure  Steve, what's up?  It's Concord  I'm here with Steve  Hang on a second  All right  Hey, what's up?  What's up, Steve?  Well, it is officially a mob scene 
[02:54:00]  We were sitting out here with Pippi Tom, Blue, Ed, and about a thousand people easily  Outside of Houlihan's, which I am told is to shut down  And these guys are singing Christmas carols  It's really amazing  Very cool  It's very cool  And I'd like to say thank you to the really self-righteous security guard  Who not only stopped us from videotaping easily a dozen times  But told us that all the help that we were doing today was completely useless  Because it was only one day and not every day 
[02:54:30]  So that freaking kissed my ass  All right, Steve  Hey, Steve  Steve, did you get some tape anyway?  Oh, there's tape everywhere  I had my little hidden camera  Jeff and I got amazing videotapes  Thanks to a couple hidden cameras  Very cool  Hidden cameras  All right  And that footage will be up on foundrymusic.com  Absolutely  Oh, my God  Thanks, man  Thank you, Steve  One of the homeless guys very nervous about the hidden cameras  And he started freaking out  Oh, no, I was stealing stuff  Todd from Buffalo writes 
[02:55:00]  I learned that asking a woman, excuse me, miss  Have you seen ten bums and a thousand people?  Will not get you laid  Ever  Ever  Ah, Psycho Mark  We're just starting to exit the hall  We're drinking our way  And we're paying the ass  Tommy  He's charging shopping  I'll tell you that  I don't know if it's the phone or his drinking, Opie  I couldn't understand a word Mark said  A little of both, I believe  Rick  All right, we lost Rick  Okay  Well, they're obviously making their way out of the mall, Anthony  Yeah 
[02:55:30]  Back on the bus for the trip back to New York City  And, well, tomorrow we'll have all the stories from the trip back to New York  I'm sure it's going to get really interesting  And some audio from the bus trip back, too  Because I think they got a couple of debt machines there  Yeah  Rick, what's up?  Hey, guys, I got a quick one that I learned  Okay  That even the smell of homeless people's feet nearly gets me to puke right in the store  That's got to be disgusting, man  I gagged four times while Ed was trying on a pair of sneakers 
[02:56:00]  Oh, man  And it didn't even look like he had socks on  Yeah  Hey, Rick, what's going on out there?  Looks like Snoop is coming out of the mall  Some other of the homeless people that are joining us as we wait for the bus  Okay  The bus should be here, like they said, any minute  So, uh  All right  We're just laying back into the group here  Yeah, it seems like more of the homeless guys are coming out, including Ziggy  Hey, Rick  Yo  You're going to get some audio on the bus trip?  Yeah, we'll run some audio on the bus and video and pictures and everything 
[02:56:30]  All right, good deal, man  All right, we'll see you guys later  All right, call back when the bus arrives  I'll call you when the bus arrives  All right, good  Just a huge crowd out there, man  Hey, Frank, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey  Laugh my ass off, just like last time  Oh, cool, man  That was fun  Hey, who was chaperoning who?  Psycho Mark or Rock and Roll Tommy?  That's a great question  I know, you know something?  Both of them became complete equals  I don't know, man  When they left that bar  I'm surprised they didn't arrest Mark  All right, thank you, Frank 
[02:57:00]  All right, later  Let's go to Anthony  Anthony, what do you have for the show today?  What's up, guys?  Hey  Hey, man  I think you guys just effing rule, man  You guys are just great  Hope, I think you're a genius  Yeah, whatever  And that guy in the morning is like the biggest rip-off, man  Anybody call and saying that you guys are rip-offs or whatever  Just don't know what they're talking about  Well, it sounds like you're pissed off  It pisses us off, too  Because we work pretty hard on this damn radio show  Yeah, I mean, you guys  I mean, you know, that guy has a lot of nerve, man  Getting on the air saying that  He invented a lot of stuff 
[02:57:30]  Oh, he's a douchebag  He's getting on  He's all pissed off  Because he was laughing  And he's so brainwashed  That he feels he shouldn't laugh at anything else on the radio  Because somebody's been telling him for years  That there's nothing else that could be on the radio  That could be entertaining  That's it  Exactly  I mean, I used to listen to that guy for a long time  And I haven't listened to him now in months  And when you guys got on before  Saying about that bit that you guys do  That he ripped off  I mean, that's just pathetic  Well, whatever  Thank you, Anthony  You guys are the best, man 
[02:58:00]  Well, I'm sure they're dumping out  As they dump out  Which is just fantastic  Thank you  Incredible  All right  You guys rule, man  You guys are the greatest  Hell, man  They didn't rain on our parade today  We had a great time  No, you guys are great, man  That was like one of the best shows I've ever heard in my life  Thank you, Anthony  That was great  I believe tomorrow we bring back  Guess What's in My Pants  Live on this show  Full version  Might as well  From the originals  All right  Thank you, Anthony  Take care, guys  Yeah  Yeah, but he doesn't take from anyone  Sure  Okay  Yeah  Rick, what's up?

I think Ziggy  I didn't hear Ziggy get on the bus 
[03:02:30]  Who else?  I would say Tippy Tom  Spur was very paranoid  He might have ran  Yeah, he might have bolted  Ron, what's up?  Hey, guys, what's up?  I'll tell you  This is one of the most hilarious  Second editions of the Homeless Shopping Spree ever  And I'll tell you right now  What a great sequel  Oh, yeah, I'm taping it  I wonder if they're going to do it again  Christmas Day anyway  You know, we didn't want to do  Homeless Shopping Spree again  Because we didn't think we could top ourselves  But I must say, man  A lot of people worked really hard  Behind the scenes  And this was a home run today 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, Keith did a great job  Home run  You guys did great  But I'm going to tell you one thing  This is more funnier than last year's first Homeless Shopping Spree  Is that Rick says  Is that a train?

[03:04:00]  Without hearing from the gang  Aw  I want to hear who is missing  I want to give props to Keith the cop  This wouldn't have been possible without Keith  Norton is still in baby gap  Aw  Is that what they're saying?

[03:07:00]  So you think this is funny?  The Frankie Blue thing?  I do  I love it  Anytime you can  It's very voyeuristic  Even though it's going out to a bunch of people on the radio  I think this is very voyeuristic  It's an uncomfortable situation  It's somebody put in a position they shouldn't have been in  Well, I guess what happened  Our old radio station, WNEW  Yeah  There's a curse with our old station  Ever since we left  Absolutely  Ever since we left  It's just been in the toilet  They can't figure out what to do with the station 
[03:07:30]  And it's just failing miserably  Ratings are always in the toilet  They have tried  How many different formats?  They've tried three or four since we left  Yep  And the one that did the best  Was the three months that they played Christmas music last year  Right  They started like at Halloween  And played it through New Year  And it did better than any format they put on there  Well, our old company  They hired this dope John Sykes  Who was supposed to help the radio division  And the radio division has been a disaster 
[03:08:00]  Ever since he took the helm  And now they're just kind of paying him  And he's like in a little office  And no one bothers him  Because he's under contract  And they're going to fire him real soon  But he had no business  Trying to run the radio division of Viacom  Got to bump Joel Hollander up into that position  He's the genius  Joel Hollander is an amazing radio guy  And he will right the ship  But this guy  John Sykes  Which is just a waste of space  An asshole  A two-faced fuck  You know, he told Anthony and I  When we did the Sex with Sam thing 
[03:08:30]  That  Crazy-haired dick  That we were going to be okay  He said we were going to be okay  And then all of a sudden  He just blew us off  Never talked to us again  And then just hid behind lawyers  And, you know, and his secretary and stuff  Never could get him on the phone again  And we find out how he didn't like the show  Didn't like what we were doing  That's the type of executive you want  Running your radio division  A guy that doesn't have balls  And will tell you to your face  What's going on, you know  Oh, didn't he think it was bad for kids, the show?  Yeah  Yeah  So, you know, he thought he knew what he was doing  And we get fired 
[03:09:00]  And the station has been a complete disaster ever since  And the radio division, quite frankly, has been a complete disaster ever since  They lost millions upon millions of dollars  And in the end, it was John Sykes' fault  Simple as that  Joel Hollander wasn't running the radio division back then  He just wasn't  And anyway, it's unheard of in radio history  To have a station that has been floundering for as long as any W  It just doesn't happen  When that happens at a station, they fix it  They fix the problem  Right  Especially in New York  Right, it's the number one mark in the country 
[03:09:30]  Right  You can't have a radio property just sitting there with one rating  And a history like any W has  Yeah  It's in last place  There are radio stations that don't even have a signal  A strong signal in Manhattan that are beating our old station  Easy listening music stations from Long Island beat it out  Right  It's ridiculous  So getting back to the Frankie Blue thing in our old radio station  That has just been in the toilet ever since we left  Falling apart  Because they really thought they knew what they were doing  By firing us and moving on 
[03:10:00]  Oh yeah, they figured they would compete with other stations that are doing very well around New York  Because boy, there's a win situation  Go head-to-head against stations that are just entrenched in the market  Have great ratings doing what they're doing  Because people will just change their habits like that  For the same thing they could get in the place that they've been for years and years and years  Now RuPaul is what, their morning person now, wasn't RuPaul?  Person, that's good  Oh, whatever, yeah  Morning guy  Yeah  It's a guy 
[03:10:30]  Morning parental disappointment  When I  It's RuPaul the drag queen does mornings over there  Okay  When I sit there and you have to listen to some people go  RuPaul, she is so pretty  It's got a cock  It's a guy  Boy, you're a buzzkill  Sorry  Big smooth back  So then the old company gets a bright idea to hire this Frankie Blue guy  Because he was really good at KTU, I guess  What was KTU?  Kind of like a dance mix station?  Yeah, kind of like commercial dance music 
[03:11:00]  Like dance music  So they're like, well, we'll hire the guy that made KTU great  Uh-huh  And we'll put him on NEW and he'll have the same success over here  Right  Well, so far he hasn't done anything  Except get drunk at Christmas gatherings  Oh  And Earl was there too  Yeah, our old pal Earl was here  Earl  Was there, I should say  And Earl did not give us this tape  I want to go on the record and tell you  He did not have anything to do with the tape we're about to play 
[03:11:30]  Right  He didn't  Okay  So Frankie Blue was at the Christmas luncheon a couple days ago  A Christmas luncheon?  They did a Christmas luncheon  And I guess everyone got completely hammered  I would too if I was working over there  As a matter of fact, I did many times  Yeah, he got destroyed, everyone else  And with the ratings that just came out  I think he had a few extra shots  Because he's probably thinking, oh my god, I'm a fraud at this point  Oh boy  So then he goes back to the station  And he gets into some kind of argument with the DJ that was supposed to go on the air 
[03:12:00]  Now if he was a little tipsy at the time  I'm thinking it probably wasn't one of those good legitimate arguments where you have a point  I've been in arguments with drunk people  They don't usually make good points during arguments  You ever notice that?  What is that?  Why you gotta wear that fucking shirt?  Oh, there's a good argument  Yeah, this one will last about 18 hours straight  Yeah  So that's what he does  He goes over there, gets in a little tiff  And it's the DJ that's supposed to go on the air  She pretty much runs out of the station crying or something 
[03:12:30]  I don't know  I wasn't there  Oh boy  But something happened and she just ran out  So now someone has to do the radio show  So who do they get to do the show?  Well, Frankie Blue is the boss over there  He decides, oh, fuck her, I'll just do it  He's gonna take the mic  But he's not a DJ?  He's not on air?  He's the program guy  He's a legendary, quote, programmer here in New York  Was he ever on the air?  You'll see how legendary he is in a minute here  And then he goes, oh, fuck, I don't need her  I'll just do her shift 
[03:13:00]  And I'll do probably a better job  Now he's doing it for WNEW  During this, he's talking about KTU  Which is their arch rival in competition  He's just using the KTU call letters  He makes a mistake and actually says, you know  On 1027 WKTU  KTU  And it's NEW  Yeah, that's the station they're trying to beat  Yeah  Oops  Oh, they must have been loving this at KTU  I bet they play this and just laugh their balls off  So Ben has been playing this all morning in the office 
[03:13:30]  Just laughing like an idiot  Like Ben  I think it's hilarious  Yeah  Yeah  And Earl's there  Earl jumps on the air at some point  Earl was the producer  Board op  Yeah  He's the board op guy  The girl that does the show  Is supposed to do that  And Earl hits the buttons when she goes to commercials  And stuff like that  He operates the board  Yeah  So he had to board op for Frankie  Who's all hammered  Right  And who's his boss  And who's his boss  So Earl  I guess you hear him chime in a couple of times  I guess just out of nervousness 
[03:14:00]  And you know  He must have been sitting there going  Oh my god  This guy's hammered  He can't even talk  He's stammering  He's forgetting words  He hiccups in one word  And it makes the word two words  Yeah  And Earl's just like you can tell  He's really nervous  And then you gotta understand too  This is one of those radio stations  Where you talk really quickly between the music  Music's the most important thing  If you're talking more than 30 seconds  You're not doing your job  He's talking for about four minutes here  Oh I know  We cut it down  But we'll play about two and a half minutes of this 
[03:14:30]  But he's just babbling about nothing  Saying the wrong call letters  This is the boss of the radio station  That was supposed to put WNEW back on the map  Here you go  In New York radio  The boss  So here  You know what  I gotta be honest  If they got Frankie Blue drunk every day to do a radio show  Oh yeah  The ratings would go through the roof  I'd listen every day  Absolutely  And I hate that type of music  But that's the type of thing they should do  Just get drunks on the air  Drunk DJs  Drunk DJs  I love this song 
[03:15:00]  This is the fucking boss  I love this guy  He's fucking hammered  And don't think for a second  That this is some kind of relaxed laid back delivery  Yeah this is not radio from the 70s  When all the DJs were encouraged to talk like this  This guy's hammered  This is the type of station where you know  Your voice has to be way up there  Like WKTU  Yeah high energy  Don't forget RuPaul at the Mordead  Yeah high energy  Your next chance to win $2,000  Coming up with RuPaul tomorrow morning  RuPaul let's get back to the music 
[03:15:30]  The new mix WNAW  That's the delivery you're supposed to have  Right  And he completely messes up  You're supposed to hit the post  Which is stop talking right when the vocals kick in  He goes right over the phone  Oh I know  Stomps on it  And he's the boss  I love this song  Nelly featuring Tim McGraw  This is Frankie Blue  Now you know for the last several weeks 
[03:16:00]  We've been  Giving you a chance  To win $50,000 in cash  Holy shit  Wow  That is snotted  Wow  Hey this is Frankie Blue  This was the guy that was supposed to get  N.E.W. out of the toilet  He's taking the record off the turntable  You think he's gonna use the turntable?

[03:18:30]  But it doesn't really matter  It's a talk show  You just  Go with the flow  And if I fuck up  You know  Someone's gonna jump on me  And tell me so  But at these radio stations  Everything has to be  Just perfect  Right  And you're not supposed  To just babble and babble  You gotta get back to the music  Yeah  As far as I'm concerned  You guys never fuck up  Thank you Kenny  Thank you Kenny  Very sweet  Just enjoy your hustler  And let us do the heavy lifting here  Okay  Isn't that funny  That's right  50 grand prize winner  Of the redo contest

[03:21:00]  Right  But he says KTU  Which is their arch rival  Pick the two stations in your city  That battle it out between each other  And picture one of the jocks  Being drunk  And making the mistake  Of using the other station's call  So here's the boss  At our old station  I'd drink too  If I was the boss over  That shithole  Completely hammered  Ratings are in the toilet  He has to go on the air  He thought he could handle it  And this is some more of him  Doing his little show  Mix 1027  The new Mix 1027

[03:22:00]  I guess  Luncheon  He's on the air at the 7 to 12 shift at night  So the luncheon was probably  You know, what?  Noon, 1?  Noon to 3, 4 maybe?  Love the nooners, man  Pounding them during the nooners  Here we go  This is Frankie Blue  And I am so excited for tomorrow  I got Ricky and Rue  Coming in in the morning  Putting a hand in the big old barrel 
[03:22:30]  And picking out a $50,000 grand prize winner  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo  Oh, there it is  Winner of the KTU Mix 102  Ooh, where the hell do I work?  Is he going to start singing Janis Joplin tunes?  Wow  Oh my God  This doesn't sound like just alcohol, by the way 
[03:23:00]  That's my opinion  Dude, this sounds like you're fired  Yeah  This is a firing offense  Yeah, because this is the guy  This is the boss  This isn't some stupid DJ that has a coke problem  She should be  That you're trying to, you know, take care of  What?  She should be fired for walking off the shift  He's the boss  Dude, he told her to leave  Oh, he told her to leave?  It just shows you that the old place is still a fucking train wreck  Yeah, it is  It's a dump  Yeah, smart move  Getting rid of Opie and Anthony  The only thing that was happening over there  Even when you were there, it stunk 
[03:23:30]  Except for Ron and Fez  Those guys did okay  Us and Ron and Fez  We, you know, we kept the ship going  Yep  They were making a lot of money off our show and Ron and Fez  They should have backed us  Instead, they got this mess  Two years later  Two and a half years later  They still have nothing  Some of the most entertaining programming I've ever heard out of that station, though  Right here  I would put this guy on the air every day drunk  Every day drunk  I would listen every freaking day  And he's, quote, a legend in New York radio  Wow  A fiery wreck today on our wreck cam 
[03:24:00]  Boy, that's a bad one  That is a bad one today  How embarrassed do you think he is this morning if he's up yet?  Oh my God  When you wake up sober and you'll hear it  You'll, ugh  All hungover  Shaking, feeling a little nauseous  Your head is pounding  And your phone's ringing  Frankie  Yeah, Frankie, pick up  Pick up  Yeah, I heard your, uh  I heard your air show last night  What, are you stupid? 
[03:24:30]  You fucking drunk?  You get a call from Infinity yet?  You will  Yeah, you will  Take a couple of aspirin and get your ass out of bed  Because I'm sure you'll be in a meeting today  Can you say fired?  Fired  Yeah, call up Hoppy and Anthony  They'll give you some pointers on what to do during your time off  You idiot  And it's not like nobody's heard this clip  This clip just hasn't been circulating through the radio circles all morning  You know, it's like  Dude, I emailed it to everybody this morning  Frankie, it's your mom 
[03:25:00]  Hi  How you doing?  Dr. Phil said when you give something up to replace it with something else  So, um, I was good to see you giving up the NEW call letters  And replacing it with the KTU call letters, you stupid fuck  I'm your mother so I can say that  Come on over, we'll do shots  I love you  Oh, isn't that great?  There's just a little more here  I gotta hear the KTU thing again  I hear there's a third clip  No, no, this is it  No, this is the 
[03:25:30]  Rumor has it there's a third clip  Well, I think this  At this point is when he was removed  After this break  He was removed from the station  Who removed him?  The general manager  Oh, that is not good  The GM came in and took him off the air?  He's the Mac Daddy at every radio station  Holy shit  Doesn't go much higher than the GM  Who finished the shift?  I would assume they probably just played music  Probably just played music and Earl pushed the button  That's good  When your big boss has to come into the studio  And you're supposed to be in charge of all your DJs  And tell you to get the fuck off the air  Oh, get off 
[03:26:00]  You are so fired  Go home  Fired  Come out like the manager going to the mound  Just get out  Get out  Do you got the KTU line in there again?  Did you rewind it a little?  I gotta hear him screw up on the calls again  Yeah  He's supposed to say WNEW once again  As winner  The winner of the KTU Mix 102 Redo Contest  And also you win a Toyota Scion  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull 
[03:26:30]  They're going to put their hand in the barrel  They're going to pick out a winner  And then they're going to fight that winner  And that winner will be rewarded with everything  Mix 102.7  He's stepping all over  He's supposed to be done by the time those lyrics kick in  That is like the most important thing in that type of radio  In that type of radio?  Man, you gotta hit the post  It's called hit the post, right, exactly  What did he say?  We're going to fuck the winner?  That sounded like it  Oh, is that where they thought he cursed? 
[03:27:00]  Yeah  I didn't even notice that until we just listened to him  Toyota Scion  Now what's going to happen is they're going to pull  They're going to put their hand in the barrel  They're going to pick out a winner  And then they're going to fight that winner  Fight  What?  What was that?  I think he said fuck  They're going to fuck that winner  I think he was going to say fuck it  And was able to stop just in time  Fight that winner 
[03:27:30]  That's not a word  They're going to pick out a winner  And then they're going to fight that winner  And that winner will be rewarded with everything  Mix 102.7  Frankie Blue  What's happening?  Tries to have the cool little thing like he's out  Like, yeah, I meant to step all over the vocals  Frankie Blue, what's happening, baby?  All I know is the FCC should hear about that 
[03:28:00]  Ooh  And they're going to fuck that winner  At least you guys never said that  Fuck  Right in the asshole  Frankie Blue, baby  They're going to stick it in the barrel  And they're going to pull it out  And fuck the fucking fucker  Frankie Blue, baby  On KTU  W-N-E-double

On W-D-R-U-N-K  Well, this story is developing  But I do believe he's  Fired  Fired  How long has he been there?  Not too long, man  He was supposed to be the big hire  That was going to turn around that  Crap hole  That was it 
[03:29:00]  He was going to be the guy  At the turnpike  That big fire  Jersey turnpike  You know what that's got to be doing to traffic  Oh, boy  Oh, boy  We have audio  Ridgefield  General manager coming in  To Frankie Blue  You're fired  Do you have the audio of Frankie Blue after he was fired?  The, um  If, uh  I may  A little more, um  Alright, I'll  You're fired  Wow, you had to tell him twice  And, uh, trying to console him, I guess  It's over, Johnny  Aw  And then, uh, Frankie Blue

[03:31:00]  Why did you come in for Bernie?  Yeah, Earl  What's going on with you?  You should have come in for Bernie Getz  I'm sorry, guys  Wouldn't that be great?  Having Bernie in here with a black gentleman?  All I wanted was to get a photo with Earl and Bernie  I thought that would be hilarious  But then people in Earl's community probably would have been very upset with you  You could have staged something where, you know, he's handing you five bucks and you're laughing about it  You know?  Or you have your hand out like you want it and he's reaching into his pants, grabbing the gun  Sure 
[03:31:30]  Holding a screwdriver  And then he hears your black rock coalition idea and shoots himself  Earl, how are you?  Can't hang with a comedian, I'm not going to even try  Where's your headphones, Earl?  All right, no big deal  How is it over there at NEW?  Quiet  Hey, thanks for that tape, by the way  I did not, I swear, as Christ is my witness, I have nothing to do with it 
[03:32:00]  With what, the Frankie Blue tape that you handed me personally?  No, I  In the middle of the night when no one was looking?  You're an awful human being, you know  Earl had nothing to do with the Frankie Blue tape  Of course not  Aside from the fact that you ran the board, right?  Anthony, why are you winking as you say that?  I know  What were you thinking as that was happening?  It was over, that's all I was thinking  Why didn't you say to him, did you say something like during commercials or something and say, hey, you know, maybe you're a little too intoxicated to be on the air?  I have no response to that, I have no comment 
[03:32:30]  No comment, he's so shy  He is a typical Viacom employee  What are you going to do, cut your two out, yeah, you're like Dana McClintock  Bland douche  Anything, Earl? Can you contribute anything to this program by telling us what was going on?  Absolutely nothing, I got nothing  You don't want to talk about it  No  The drunk, was he indeed drunk?  No comment  I got more info from Bernie Goetz and he shot four guys 
[03:33:00]  Had he been drinking at the Christmas party?  Were you at the Christmas party?  There was a party earlier, yeah  Oh, and was he drinking at that party?  I don't know, quite honestly  You don't know?  I honestly don't know  No  No, I think he was popping something  What was the argument about  My personal opinion, anyway  Between him and the  That I don't know, I swear to God  Did she walk out crying?  I don't know that either  What do you mean you'll tell us off the air?  No, I'm being honest, I don't know anything  I'm telling you  Isolate that  I'm being honest, I don't know anything 
[03:33:30]  Nothing  No  Don't know what the argument was about  I have no idea what happened  Okay  You were in there, you were working the board  Who finally took him off the air?  I think he actually pulled himself  Now stop  You're not being honest  No, I am being honest  Why did he pull himself?  One minute he was there, one minute he was gone  And that's all I know  No one came in during that time?  No  That's not what we heard  Did you ask Bernie for $5?  No? 
[03:34:00]  No  Why didn't you come in and meet Bernie Gantz?  Do you have a personal problem with Bernie?  No, I don't  Because he's a black guy?  No, I don't  Honestly, I think  Four potential audience members of the Black Rock Coalition program?  No, honestly  My feelings on Bernie then were the same as they were  You know what?  If they tried to rob him, they got what was coming to him  All right  All right  Earl's taking a stand  I'll say he is  What a controversial stand he's taking  That's right  All right, don't give us any information on what happened with Frankie 
[03:34:30]  Earl, another great appearance, thank you  Earl, great  I heard Earl treated Opie finally to lunch or dinner, was it?  What was it?  No, not really  And Earl finally fessed up?  What'd you treat him to, Earl?  I didn't treat anybody  You took him up to dinner, didn't you?  No  When I didn't have money, I was telling these guys  So you had to like  I coughed up some  I always  I always offer money  Always  Always  To prostitutes, maybe 
[03:35:00]  Always?  Yes  I've never seen you offer money  At any of the dinners  It's usually everyone else digging in  Or someone pulling out a credit card  I always put money on the feet  Ben told me you had a burger and a bunch of sodas one day  And just paid for the burger without the tax or any of the sodas  No, that's not  I always overpay  No, you  Always  No, not  Come on  I'm not  Okay  Goodbye, everybody  Goodbye, everybody  Wait, Earl  Oh, Earl  Earl  Earl 
[03:35:30]  Come on, Earl  Earl  Earl  Earl  He's leaving  Oh  He's black and Jewish  Come on, Earl  Sammy Davis  I can't believe he walked out  I can  He has a good jawline, though  That was a fast appearance for Earl  I'll say  He actually left the studio  Goodbye  He's got his head down and everything  Bye-bye  I'm not coming in  Goodbye  Goodbye  I was born and raised in New York City  In a housing project way up in the hood  I dressed in dark clothing so folks started calling me black girl  Oh, and they used to laugh about it 
[03:36:00]  Cause deep down they knew they'd call me that  Cause I was as black as should  I've always been a lazy man  A couch potato with a clicker in my hand  See, motivation I never had  Hit in the shadows when the boss got mad  For twenty years I never got a raise  I'm thirty-three and I've never been late  I look busy but I'm not  I'm just walking around  I pick up some papers and I put them back down  One day I'm gonna stop paying my rent 
[03:36:30]  Live in a refrigerator box  Never get out of bed  I'm black girl  A genuine lazy bum  I'll always make it through  Hard times at any W  Then one day some lame brains came and took O&A away  And at the age of thirty-three  I felt like I was carrying the weight of the whole station on my shoulders 
[03:37:00]  And Ronnie Fezzy knew what I was going through  Every morning I'd unlock the door  Lay down and I'd sleep a little more  Then I'd put away the bathroom key  Everybody was depending on me  I'd eat a chicken wing with lemonade  Lord, give me strength to make another day  Times I felt I couldn't go on  Push a button, throw a switch, answer the phone  Got lost in the van, I did my PSAs 
[03:37:30]  Ten minutes work gonna take me all day  I'm black girl  A genuine lazy bum  I'll always make it through  Hard times at any W  I could hear Scotso say  Black girl, you're a genuine lazy bum  You'll always make it through  Hard times at any W 
[03:38:00]  Ken and Jeremy say  Black girl, you're a genuine lazy bum  Yo, check one, two  This is definitely Flavor Flavor on your radio  Just to let y'all know  Y'all are definitely listening to the worst  I mean the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  Right here  Opie and Anthony  The saga that is Frankie Blue  Is over, Anthony  Oh, yes  Is over  Hopefully we replayed the Frankie Blue stuff 
[03:38:30]  In some of the worst of  In the past few days  Oh, yeah, we did  We did?  Thursday  Oh, good  So a lot of people know  What we're talking about here then  Because we got a lot of new listeners  Through the holiday  Frankie Blue  Frankie Blue  Frankie Blue  He blew up his spot there at any W  Blue, you're my boy  You're my boy, Blue  Thanks for all the great radio  Sorry you got fired  You're my boy, Blue  You're my boy, Blue  You're my boy 
[03:39:00]  I don't have one today  Oh, hold on  Well, because I'm using your thing for this  Yeah  For the porno  Hold on  Now you're back  You're fired  Blue, you're my boy  You're fired  You're my boy, Blue  So you want to explain Frankie Blue really fast, Anthony?  Yeah, Frankie Blue was the program director  You know, the boss  Over there at the station we used to work at  WNEW in New York 
[03:39:30]  And they do like  What would you call that music?  Music  That gay guys play when they're having sex  Yeah, you could call it that  I don't know what it is  It's like that dance type music  And like music that dopey chicks put on in their car all the time  Just that crap  What's a good example, like a song that they would play?  I don't know  I'm just trying to like  So people get the grasp of the type of station it is 
[03:40:00]  To know that it's not like this  Where you could come on drunk  People have  You know  And get away with it  It's not that type of thing  It's very fast delivery  That the jocks give  And Frankie Blue was at a Christmas party  Got a little tanked, it seemed  Went back to his station  And got in a little argument  With the girl that was supposed to be coming on the air  And that's what they're saying he got fired for  Right, it's just for the argument  But he figures now she's gone 
[03:40:30]  He threw her out of there that day  Now he was going to take to the airwaves  And show the talent that is Frankie Blue  All hammered from the Christmas party  He gets on just slurring and stumbling through the show  That he was doing  And then I think the worst thing I think that he did  He called WNEW WKTU  Which is the competitor of the station  So it kind of  It really looked bad  You're not supposed to be the boss doing that  And at the time  We got a hold of this tape 
[03:41:00]  And exploited it to the max  Of course we did  And now there's radio guys all over the country  That have copies of this  And they're playing it for each other  They think it's one of the greatest things ever  I've talked to more radio guys  That said  Oh my god  I'm sending this to everybody  And all the guys in radio  Were playing it  And listening to it  Like it was the funniest thing ever  Yeah  Because we love when people screw up  Especially when it has something to do with our old station  Yep  Another program director losing his job at our old station  Yeah  They've been through a lot of them since we left there 
[03:41:30]  It's been an abomination since they unjustly booted you guys  That is correct  An abomination in the biggest radio market in the country  Yeah  And that station has been an abomination for the last two and a half years  You wouldn't see  An embarrassment  You wouldn't see a station this screwed up in a 200 market  You wouldn't see it  And this is the number one market in the country  And it has been just a mess for years  A disaster  A legendary station 
[03:42:00]  After the music went down  They put you guys on  And you're the only thing on the station  And then Ron and Fez start to do very well  Of course there's no morning show  Because they don't want to compete with Howard in New York  So they put nothing on in the morning  It's just an embarrassment man  It has been  And the revolving door of program directors that have gone through there  If you take that gig  You're insane  Because you're not going to be the one that straightens it out  There is no quick fix for that place  And they're not in it for the long haul  So you're just done 
[03:42:30]  There's no quick fix  But they don't want to wait for a longer solution to take place  So they just keep firing the people that can't fix it quick enough  Or they get drunk on the air  At least that was an original firing  The past bosses of program directors that have been through there  Have been fired because it just hasn't worked out  They can't get the station going  And now they got some new guy  I thought Steve had gotten a new job over at NEW when I read this 
[03:43:00]  It says Martini returns to NEW as PD  It's Rick Martini I guess  I thought they meant Martini Steve  Yeah Rick Martini  A 25 year radio veteran  Did a lot with his career obviously  You know what's wrong with 25 year radio veterans  He's going to bring nothing new to NEW  Nothing new  A 25 year veteran uses all the stuff he's learned over 25 years  Which is the same old crap that no one wants to listen to 
[03:43:30]  It's not new  It's not cutting edge  It's not something people are going to tune into  And go wow this is something  I got to hear this  Because they'll hear it elsewhere  No one's going to switch  If you could go to KTU say  Which is the other station that plays this kind of crap  Do we have one of those songs?  Do we actually have one?  They play this?  Are you kidding me?  Isn't this Donna Summer?  Just Donna Summer  Last Dance  Hey baby  It's Frankie Blue  It's Don 
[03:44:00]  Don Summer  And we're going to  And we're going to  We're going to listen to this last dance  Last dance Earl  Dance with me Earl  You're working my board for me today  It's Frankie Blue baby  Let me tell you something  We're here at WKY  WLY  Right  KTU  Where are we?

[03:45:30]  And  Reads into  Donna Summer's box  I mean  What a mess he was at that  I'm going to do a little riff  You know  Because I'm Frankie Blue  You know  We got RuPaul in here  I was in the bathroom  What a huge horse cock  On that black guy  Let me tell ya  What a huge horse cock  What?  Are we on the arrow?  Uh oh  And you know the station  The on air talent  Did not address it honestly 
[03:46:00]  You know they didn't goof on it  Once it happened  Just don't talk about it  Just pretend it didn't happen  Make believe it didn't happen  Until we fire you  That's pretty much what radio does  Well cause we said it earlier  I mean  They've taken the fun out of radio  Everyone has taken this whole thing  So seriously  No spontaneity  It's just radio  It's the stupidest job in America  Yeah  And no one has a sense of humor anymore  If this happens on your radio station  You gotta go with it  I agree with you baby  Frankie Blue agrees with you  Corporate people  Are talentless  Humorless  Faggots 
[03:46:30]  And they ruin  Everything they touch  That is creative  Yeah  Every time corporations  Get involved with creativity  You ruin it  Shut up  Oh sorry  Try to soak everybody  Louder  Flashback  I'm sorry  Yeah baby  On the new KTU  How long has this station been around  Why do we still call it new  Yeah  Frankie Blue here  Get me another god damn drink  Woo  Blue  You're my boy  Oh that's me  You're not funny  You're not interesting  And that's why when things like this happen  You don't know what to do with it 
[03:47:00]  You just clam up  And pretend it didn't happen  Fire it  96 was when they were the new KTU  Alright well  They still call themselves the new  So there's the Frankie Blue update  He got fired for the audio we're about to play  So he yells and screams at the poor girl that was supposed to be on the air  Whatever her name is  She's some legend too I guess  Whatever  She still got a job there?  I guess  Yeah  Oh you bet she does  I thought maybe they'd just eliminate the entire problem  You know sometimes just flush it out  Make like it never happened 
[03:47:30]  We don't have to look at her  We don't have to think about him  You know they kind of do that sometimes  But I'm sure she would sue  Oh yeah  And probably rightfully so  Someone said he manhandled her  I don't know if he did or not  He shoved her out  I have some respect for him now  I would too  Show her who's boss  Something he used to be  He thought he was big enough  Show her who used to be boss  He thought he was big enough to go on the air and do a radio shift  And we got our hands on the audio  Yeah baby  Here's Frankie Blue blowing up his career baby  There it is

I got five grand Canadian  Oh!  Hello!  What the hell could that be worth?  Eight dollars a month  Yeah, exactly  I mean, because this is radio, everyone explain what part you played in the movie  All right, I'm Zach Ward, I played Skuff Farkas, I'm the original bad boy  Right  You were the bully  I'm the original redheaded stepchild, yeah  Yeah  And I'm Ian Petrella, I played little Randy Parker 
[03:59:00]  You were a little kid, man  You were just a little kid  You were the one that, uh, had the oversized coat in  In the snowsuit  Right  And had to eat under the sink because you were a little psychopath or something  Yep  Man, and I'm Scott Schwartz, I was Flick, also known as the Tonger  Yeah  Now I have the famous tongue  Mm-hmm  Yes, yes  Yeah, we know  It's kind of like how Spider-Man got his radioactive powers  Yeah, yeah  The pole that they use in Christmas Story, if you watch it close, it glows  And they brought that pole from Chernobyl 
[03:59:30]  And after little Scotty stuck his tongue on it, he was imbued with magical power  He can actually climb a building with his tongue  He's actually climbed  It's a good morning in Haman, Indiana  It starts off with Haman  Do you even remember doing the movie?  Oh, yeah  How old were you, though?  I was eight  Oh, you were eight, okay  I mean, I looked a lot younger  You know, I was supposed to play like a five-year-old or a four-year-old  You were eight?  I was eight, and I acted like a five-year-old, so it worked out perfectly  He had diapers on underneath that outfit, which was great 
[04:00:00]  How old were you?  I'm 36  So you were what back then?  13  13, and...  I was 14, I'm 37  You were older than him?  I'm the oldest one  Yeah, but I was the biggest, so I kicked everybody's ass  It was great  Now, we know where you went afterwards  What film industry you got into  Well, was it hardcore or softcore porn?  No, it was the real deal  It was the real deal  It was the real deal 
[04:00:30]  Oh, in my case, it was softcore, but that has nothing to do with it  You couldn't get a rod?  Huh?  You couldn't get a rod?  No, no wood in a lumberyard  Who'd you do sing with?  Julie Ashton  Oh, she hosts a show on this, I think  Playboy  She hosts a show on Playboy  Jimmy knows every single porn star  We had them on the show  We had them out with them, yeah  In Vegas  If you want to call it that  Yeah  More like Sactor, but that's beside the point  Sactor  You know  Push the helmet in with your two fingers  Something like that, you know  What was it, nerves a little? 
[04:01:00]  Probably got to be a little nerve-wracking  Yeah, a little bit of that  And, you know, just  There was just other  I didn't really have a chemistry with her  We were kind of like  Hi, how you doing?  Okay, fine, you know  We're going to do this  Yeah, whatever  Oh, did you want flowers?  No, I wanted  Maybe a little wine?  No, I wanted like  Did you want her to kiss you and hold you?  No, I wanted like Tyler Faith  I wanted Sunset Thomas  I wanted Ashlyn Gere  Those were the girls that I had an interest in  Right  You know  Dude, ass is ass  Fuck it  I mean, I'm sorry  If I  I'd reach around and put my finger in that hole 
[04:01:30]  And just like  Pa-coosh  Done  I'd fuck you if I had a Playboy on your back  Hey  So what happened between  Eh, eh, eh  And  Eh, eh, eh  Yeah, exactly  What went on between those two movies  That got you from point A to point B?  We all did a lot of other things  I just  I mean, my dad and I have a collectibles business out in California  I mean, I've done a lot of other things besides just point A to point B  Didn't you know that? 
[04:02:00]  I was being crude for the WWF for a couple years  I mean, I did all kinds of stuff  Oh, yeah  You worked with Dice, too  I did some stuff with Dice out in LA  Which, by the way, when we were leaving LA  Ian and I  There's Andrew Dice Clay  He's on Dice  Taken off  And we were gonna be like  Hey, Scotty  But he's like making out with his wife and shit  And I didn't want to like tap him on the shoulder  That's not his wife  Trust me, okay  I gotta dump that whore  Oh, yeah  Oh!  I got my tongue in this chick's ass  What did you do with him?  I just did stand-up with him at the comedy store  Yeah?  Yeah, I was doing like this whole bit 
[04:02:30]  Dice Jr.  And it was hysterical  You know, so we had a lot of fun with it for a while  Yeah, I worked there in 89, 90, 91  They call it like the second golden years at the comedy store  Yeah  With Dice, Sam Kinison, Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall, Yakov Smirnoff  I was there  Well, Yakov, now you're talking the big guy  Bob Icon  Now you've impressed us  Yeah  The only guy that ever tipped me when I worked at the comedy store  When I worked in the valet  He couldn't get his rolls out and I pulled it out  And he said, you're a nice boy, he's $50 
[04:03:00]  I said, oh shit, man, that's a $50 bill  He was the only guy that ever tipped me at the comedy store  You know what you're talking about that story?  That Yakov had a rolls  Yeah  That's the most upsetting part of that fucking story  Exactly  The man's a fucking genius and you back off  Alright, alright  You jealous fucker  I am  You little regular shit  I am  Yeah  Alright  Let's go to T-Bagger  T-Bagger  What's up, fellas?  What do you got?  Hey, how's it going?  Listen, I gotta call this cat out  I do adult films down in Florida  And you don't get to choose who you fuck  You just show up and you do it 
[04:03:30]  If you're a man, you get a ride and you take care of business  Or Viagra, Levitra, Cialis  That would be in your case  But consider the deal that I had  We were just trying to get somebody that I would, you know, have some chemistry with  It just didn't work  Yeah  Well, what's the fucking deal, man?  You like the cock or what?  I mean, she's a beautiful woman  Absolutely  Unfortunately, the week before she worked with me  She worked with Mr. Marcus and Shawn Michaels and did a DP  And that's like putting the fucking Hugo through a goddamn Lincoln Tunnel, alright, man?  So what you're saying is you got a little cock  I'm not Mr. Marcus or Shawn Michaels 
[04:04:00]  Let's just put it that way  I know both of them, I shot both of them on video  I know what they look like, dude  It's like my leg  Let's say hi to Charles in Delaware  Charles  Hey, Charles  Hey, guys  Hey, Scott  I just want to ask you  What was it like working with Richard Pryor on the toy, man?  That's insane  Fantastic  Probably the nicest, sweetest, kindest  They're not enough experlatives to say how great this man is  After we did the movie, sent me telegrams  You know, well wishes at the holidays  An incredible human being 
[04:04:30]  You actually still hang out with him all the time?  I still see Richard  I go to his house  I mean, he's got MS  And he's got any bad shape  Actually, Scotty won't talk about it  Because he's too cool  But I have no class  Scotty has actually created a film  That is going to be raising money for Richard  And there's a  Dude, there's a fucking whack of celebrity stars  That are going to be doing cameos in this movie  And all the money is going to be going towards raising money for MS and Richard  And I think  That's cool  I think Richard turned 65 yesterday  Yes, he did  I think it was his big birthday last year 
[04:05:00]  Oh, yeah  You have no idea how jealous I am that you're friends with him  That really hurts  He's the greatest  The thing is  It really showed me how wonderful a person he is  When I started putting together this project  And, you know, I went and talked to Whoopi Goldberg  And I talked to Jim Carrey  And I talked to all the comedians  And the entertainers  And the sports personalities  And I'm like  I'm doing this thing for Richard  And nobody said  How much are we getting?  It was  Where do we have to be?  And when do we have to be there?  And that's the reaction I've been getting from everybody  Did anybody say no?

[04:13:00]  At English Town  You've been there  It's built up  The rubber  There it is  Oh, English Town  Right  Hey, this is Billy Conley  And you're listening to  The worst of Opie and Anthony  I had to Christmas up my house  A little bit  Oh, that's right  You know  My girlfriend did all the work  I thought you did  I called you last night  And you said you were outside  Hanging up lights and stuff  I just threw up  Anthony was outside  It was like 17 degrees yesterday  You can't even stand walking  From the building a block  To get your car  I bundle up like an Eskimo 
[04:13:30]  And I shiver the whole way  To my car  It's awful  It's an awful walk  From here to the parking garage  No, all I did  Was throw one of those  Those light blankets  They make now  They really make it easy  For people  It's  You open the box up  And unravel this thing  And it's a blanket  It's like a net mesh  With Christmas lights on it  And you just throw it  Over your bush  Or your bushes  In front of your house  Oh, wow  So now you don't have to  Go around and around  With the individual  Stray on the lights 
[04:14:00]  You just throw these blankets  Over your trees  Very cool  So I did that  To like two of them  But no, no  My girlfriend took care  Of like putting them  Around the garage door  And out the windows  You were telling me  Last night  I called Anthony  He goes  I was outside  Marking my territory  I have to let  The Jewish neighbors there  Know that  There's a Catholic  On the block  By gum  On the block  Sorry  Catholic on the black  There's a black  On the  Look how  I don't think  The Catholic church  Would appreciate that  The Freudian slips  There's no blacks 
[04:14:30]  In my neighborhood  A Catholic on a black  Wow  On the block  Wow  You know what  Alright  You know what  They would do to you  In our neighborhood  Ouch  It was  Yeah  So you know  I had to have some lights  And let people know  That we celebrate Christmas  In our house  Not that Hanukkah stuff  Are you one of the only ones  One of the only households  I saw one other lonely house  Kind of way down the block  With some Christmas lights on it  But no  For the most part 
[04:15:00]  It's menorahs in the windows  Or no decorations whatsoever  And I was feeling a little  You know  Did you get yourself a nice  A little bummed  Blow up  Frosty  No  None of those  I should have like  The big plastic snowman  And Santa  For the front lawn  Really do it up  And piss the neighbors off  I want to  I just want to  Pop those things  They're everywhere now  Yeah  Yeah  Very popular item  I remember a couple years back  You know  Maybe one person  In the neighborhood had  And you're like  Oh wow  That's kind of neat  You know  Blow up  Frosty the snowman 
[04:15:30]  You know  That's different  Than what you usually  See in front of houses  Now every house  Has it  Yeah  They take off  After  I remember years ago  When the icicle lights  First came out  Yeah  Somebody decided  Instead of just a string of lights  You could have the string of lights  And then other strings  Hanging off of that string of lights  So it looks like icicles  And when you first saw them  It was like  Wow  That's kind of unique and new  Now everyone has them  And they're not special anymore  I was going to get it like a  I was thinking of getting a manger scene  To really piss off the neighbors 
[04:16:00]  Imagine that  It's just a complete Jewish neighborhood  And having little baby Jesus  In the  In the little manger scene  You really should  It would  I think it would  Spruce up the neighborhood  Show that there is some diversity  And you're right  Nice try Jews  In Christmas lights  In your window  Dear Jews  Please try not to kill this one  Wow  Wow  Yeah so my house looks 
[04:16:30]  A little more Christmassy  Kind of happy about that  I have a reef  Got little stockings  For our fireplace  Really?  Yeah  You're really being a fag  I'm not being a fag  It's just  When  You know what happens  You're getting domesticated  You know  It usually ends up  That Christmas goes by  And then after the fact  You're like  I came and went  And you know  Like I hate the whole thing  With Christmas  With the shopping  And the presents  And having to give  Like having to give people  Stuff that you don't know 
[04:17:00]  What the hell they want  And it sounds like  The old cliche  I don't like the commercialization  Of it  It's not that  It's just  I really don't enjoy  The forced  Things you have to do  Every year for Christmas  But then once it passes  And you did really nothing  It's kind of like  Ah you know  I kind of missed out  On a little bit  So this year  It's kind of cool  You know  Our little house  Is kind of Christmassy  To walk around  In a sweater  In a pipe  Admiring your work 
[04:17:30]  There it is  Hon  I've got to call  That chimney man  So he could light  A little yule log  In that fireplace  Yeah that's me  Oh god  Slippers  Well I could use  This all year long  Thank you dear  Are your slippers  And your pipe  Waiting for you  When you come through  The door  Yes yes  An old blue  My dog  Is sitting there  On the side  For me to pat on the head  Come here boy  Woof woof  It's a regular 
[04:18:00]  Norman Rockwell painting  My house  It's hard to be a Jew  On Christmas  My friends won't let me  Join in any games  And I can't sing  Christmas songs  Or decorate  A Christmas tree  Or leave water  Out for Rudolph  Cause there's  Something wrong with me  My people don't believe  In Jesus Christ divinity  I'm a Jew 
[04:18:30]  A lonely Jew  On Christmas  Hanukkah is nice  But why is it  That Santa passes over my house  Every year  And instead of eating  Ham  I have to eat  Kosher like peas  Instead of Silent Night  I'm singing  Hu-hach-do-cavish  And what the fuck 
[04:19:00]  Is up with lighting  All these fucking candles  Tell me please  I'm a Jew  A lonely Jew  I can't be married  I can't be married  Cause I'm Hebrew  On Christmas  Hey little boy  I couldn't help but hear  You're feeling left out  Of Christmas cheer 
[04:19:30]  But I've come to say  That you shouldn't be sad  This is the one month  That you should be glad  Cause it's nice  To be a Jew  On Christmas  You don't have to deal  With the season  At all  You don't have to be  On your best behavior  Or give to charity  You don't have to go  To grandma's house  With your alcoholic family 
[04:20:00]  And I don't have to sit  On some fake Santa's lap  And have him breathe  A stinky breath on me  That's right  You're a Jew  A styling Jew  It's a good time  To be Hebrew  On Christmas  On Christmas 
[04:20:30]  Hi this is Hillary Swank  And you're listening  To the Opie and Anthony show  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  You're listening to the worst  Hey this is Richard Dreyfuss  And you're listening to the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  This is the fucking worst  Of Opie and Anthony  That's pretty stupid  How was your Christmas there Anthony?  Oh wonderful 
[04:21:00]  Were you done with your Christmas  Jimmy?  Nothing?  I didn't open one present  I didn't see one person  Except until I went  To the pet dinner  Did you go see your family  Or anything like that?  Nah I talked to them  I'm going to see them  I'm going to bring them out to LA  And you had no gift to open up?  None  Are you kidding?  No  That's okay  It's my own design  I didn't buy any either  Oh you didn't get anybody  I'm going to buy some today  My family  I went the American Express gift card  Or root  Route  Whatever you want to say  And I'm noticing  Or I did notice anyway 
[04:21:30]  A lot of gift cards this year  By the entire family  Like Christmas Eve  My family does  Well the news did a report  They said gift cards  Were just massive this year  Massive  People have reached the point  Where it's convenient  It's not like  The old gift certificate  To some cheesy place  You could get  American Express gift cards  Or other gift cards  That are good in  Multiple places  You go  You use it like a credit card  It looks like a credit card  You go there  You use it like a credit card 
[04:22:00]  And it's however much money  You have on it  Where do you get them?  AmericanExpress.com  Is where I got mine  And yeah  They get delivered to your house  You throw them in some cards  And hand them out  And that's what I did  The most work I did  Was on Photoshop  I made something  That I could print  On the envelopes  With everyone's name  With a little shadowing  And some nice festive colors  And stuff  And print it out  A bunch of envelopes  By the look of disgust 
[04:22:30]  Jimmy  I don't know  I was in the Christmas spirit  Sounds like it  And that's what I gave out  Next year I'm just going to do  Some wheeling and dealing  What do you mean?  You're going to give me a gift card  I'm going to give you a gift card  We swear  We're good?  We're good  Okay let's not worry about each other  How about me and you?  Me and you?  You're going to give me a gift card  Okay we're done right?  That's it  That's it  Done right?  And then all I have to do  Is buy a gift for my mom  And I'm good to go  Then we had a big controversy  Over my mom's gift  Because my mother  For some reason  Does not want to leave 
[04:23:00]  The 1800s  The digital to her  Is some evil thing  I talk to her all the time  About things like  The internet movie database  IMDB  Dot com  You go there  If you want to find out  Anything about movies  My mother  One of the biggest movie buffs  Ever  Loves going to the movies  Loves old movies  New movies  Just loves it  And I tell her about IMDB  Because there's constantly  Times where you go  Who the fuck was the actor 
[04:23:30]  That was in that movie?  IMDB  You got the answer  In a second  She insists  And every year  She gets it  The big thick  Leonard Malton book  Of movies  Like you're going through  This big encyclopedia  Of movies  To find answers  And trying to cross reference  Things  I mean you could just  Pop it on  Because she will not  Get a computer  We have tried  Getting her a computer  Maybe she reads it  On the bowl  Well you know  A laptop fits there  In the bathroom 
[04:24:00]  Let me tell you  I don't think she reads it  On the bowl  And I don't want that  Image conjured up either  I'm only saying  Play devil's advocate  Why would you want  A big book  Sometimes I spend  Hours on the bowl  I like a big thick book  To peruse  A lot of people  May do that  That's not out of the realm  I could read my phone  On the book  It's very handy  I could read my phone  On the bowl  On the bowl  On the book  Alright a flub  Market  No no no  I just  I wasn't sure what you meant  You mean you said  On the bowl  You read your phone  Alright  Yeah  There's plenty of things to read  On the bowl 
[04:24:30]  And my mother  Isn't reading it  On the bowl  Was that  No  Did I  Yeah  I don't know  I have a son about  Reading a phone  No he said  Reading his phone  Yeah  I do read the phone  You can read the phone  These days  That's what you do  In this modern digital age  That my mother is just  Not  She wants no part of  So years ago  We tried to even get her  That  Remember when web tv  Was out  Yeah  It's like look  It's on the tv  Just so you can get  A fucking email  So we can send you  A picture 
[04:25:00]  Or something  So it doesn't have to be  Put a photo  In the mail  With a stamp  And mail it to her  She wants nothing  To do with it  They tried getting her  A digital camera  A couple of years ago  That plugs right into  A docking station  On the thing  And photos  Come out  No computer involved  I don't  Oh no  I  No  No  So this year  They got her  A digital camera  She wants no part of it  So I got  And I start a big controversy 
[04:25:30]  Because me and my girlfriend  Got her  A Canon  35mm camera  Got a regular film camera  And now that started  Because we didn't  You know  To talk  It's like  Oh we got her  A digital camera  Now she's not even  Going to use  The digital one  Because  Big controversy  On the gift giving  For mom's camera  But that was about  The biggest controversy  Aside from  The present my brother  Gave me  Which  Probably one of the best  Christmas presents ever 
[04:26:00]  Wait wait  Before you go there  Yeah  So which camera  Is she going to use  So she looks at me  And goes  I'm using the film camera  Of course  I'm using  I totally undermined  Their attempt  To get her up to speed  And really fast  Because I have a thought  Before you move on  Yeah  Who else try to buy  Their like parents  Just a simple  DVD player  Nah  And your folks  Cannot figure out  How to use a DVD  Where does the tape go  No it's  It's not tape anymore  It's DVD  And here's the  Oh I don't  Their arms go up  Oh I

Who doesn't like  It's pretty much cash  Without being as tacky  As just handing them some money  You know  Because that's kind of  You know  You don't want to just  Hand people money  I think it's kind of  The same thing actually  No  But it's like  The Walt Whitman mall  Out on Long Island  Now you can just get  The gift cards  For the whole mall  So isn't that like  Just giving cash?  It is  Yeah  What's the difference?  You go to the ATM  You take out whatever  A thousand dollars let's say  And you hand it over  To some people  In your family  For Christmas  Or you wait in line 
[04:33:30]  For an hour  Just so you can have  The gift card  Because it looks  A little nicer  Didn't even have to  Wait in line for the  Oh the American Express thing?  You get them at the bank  You just go in there  And you're done  Why wouldn't everybody  Do this?  Screw the presents  And opening  And then you get something  That you don't want  And you feel bad  Because you don't want it  Yeah  You know what  So then you feel guilty  And you gotta like  Make like you like it  I think holidays  Are for the young 
[04:34:00]  For the kids  I think like  When you're still  Dressing up for Halloween  And you're in the  You know  You're older  And you're worried about  If you're gonna get  Good gifts at Christmas  I don't know  I just don't get  The older I get  I don't get it anymore  I don't  I don't care what I get  Like it doesn't  I don't want anything  I don't want anything  I know  Because I get all awkward  And weird  Because I know  People don't really know me  And they're not gonna  Get me anything  I really like  So then I have to fake it  When I'm opening stuff  And I'm sure  They think the same way 
[04:34:30]  I don't wanna think  I'm the only pompous one  I think everyone  Has that feeling  You start feeling all weird  Yeah  You open up stuff  You're like  I'm never gonna wear  This sweater  Oh  I could use this  Right  Oh thank you  And then they're like  Well I got you  A Knicks jersey  Because I know  You like basketball  Well yeah  But I don't wanna  Walk around in that  I'm not gonna walk around in that  I'm not a wigger  You know  You'll be  It's always  The logic of getting you  The gift is always  A little strange  Well I thought  I'd get you this  Yeah  Well you're into 
[04:35:00]  You're into video games  So I got you  You know  And it's always  It's just the worst game ever  It's always a game you'll never play  Oh fishing  Because all the games  The fishing video game  Because all the games  You would play  Are sold out or whatever  So you know  They don't know that  They're like  Oh that looks cool  He'll enjoy this  And I have all the games  That I want  Because I get them  When they come out  So if anyone's gonna  Get me a game  It's probably something  I don't want  If I wanted it  I would've gotten it  There was  What the hell was it  Something a couple of years ago 
[04:35:30]  One of my relatives  Had asked my girlfriend  What did I want  And she was like  I don't know  You know  You could get some kind of DVDs  Of like war documentaries  Which is cool  You hang out  There's nothing on TV  Pop one of those in  You could watch  You know  Some gooks get shot up  In Vietnam or something  I don't know  It's entertaining  And uh  So that's what she told  The relative  And what did I get  One of those huge 
[04:36:00]  Coffee table books  On like the Civil War  I'm like  I want to pop in a DVD  And watch like planes  Duking it out  Above the Pacific  I don't want to read  About Gettysburg  And how good was  Your acting  Oh wow  Oh  I held my hands up  In front of my face  And fanned my face  Going  Oh  With my little  Hot dog thumb  Wiggling  It just stinks 
[04:36:30]  It is  It's awful  But that's a prime  Example of what happens  And you know  The people that you  Get things for  Are doing the same thing  Yeah I have no doubt  In my mind  Oh this is beautiful  You know  It's like  Why bother then  We also last year  Got all the  All the women  In the family  We got them  Something from Tiffany  You know  Not the knockoff box  That some people get  And put other stuff in  You know  The real  From Tiffany  And you get the act 
[04:37:00]  Of like  Oh this is beautiful  And then it starts  Creeping in  Yeah I don't really  Wear these  That much  Like a bracelet  Or something like that  But oh  I could go back  I could take it back  I'll just  I'll take it back  And then you're at the point  Where you might as well  Just give them cash  Here's some cash  Go to Tiffany  Go to wherever you want  If you think  Most people aren't happy  With their Christmas gifts  All you have to do  Is go to the mall  The day after Christmas  Yeah there you go  What explains the huge crowds 
[04:37:30]  Of people taking crap back  And they  They can't get to the mall  Fast enough  To bring your junk back  Your  Your gift sucked  So bad  So bad  They couldn't even wait  A day  Just go there  The lines are out the door  I don't even want this  In my house for a day  Because you always go  Well just in case  I got the gift receipt  Or whatever  And you go  Oh no I don't  No I think I could wear this  I like it  Yeah as soon as you leave  You're waking up at  At 5 a.m.  To beat the crowd  In the mall  To get what you want 
[04:38:00]  Take it back  And get what you want  You selfish bastards  I don't take anything back  I don't think  I've ever taken back  A gift  They just end up  In a closet somewhere  Never used  And then eventually  When you move  They get lost  Or thrown out  Or something  But I never take  Anything back  Because I hate  I hate going to the mall  Whether it's to buy stuff  Or give it back  They're just awful places  Full of horrid people  Everyone is always  In my way  I got such a problem  With people in my way  Whether it's traffic 
[04:38:30]  Or at the mall  People just can't move fast  You just don't like  To be around people  I really don't  I guess that's right  And it's gotten worse  Over the years  I have my crowd  That I like hanging out with  My peeps  And anyone else  I really can't be bothered with  Because they annoy  The piss out of me  I don't like  Being inconvenienced  In any way whatsoever  And if that's  Me being stuck in traffic  I am convinced  It's because  Some asshole  Isn't driving properly 
[04:39:00]  Or if I'm behind somebody  If I'm in a long line  At a store  It's some jack off  Is up there  Trying to fish change out  Or writing a god damn check  They hadn't filled out  Or screwing something up  How about the guy  That  I see this a lot lately  People that have to  Use their credit cards  At like Starbucks  Oh yeah  Yeah  That happened to me  Over the weekend  I'm like you've got to be kidding  Your coffee is two dollars  Or whatever it is  I don't know  Yeah and they're pulling  Their pen out  They're pulling out  An actual credit card  Yeah  Signing 
[04:39:30]  Lay some cash down  And every time  I get up to the  Point in the line  Where people finally  I'm up at the  Front of the line  It takes two seconds  I'm never standing there  Bitching that I  Have a coupon  For a nickel off  And why aren't you  Taking it  When you stand in these stores  And these old  Bitchy women  Are complaining  Because they're supposed  To get another nickel  Or eight cents  Off of the item  That happens at the 
[04:40:00]  Drugstore a lot  All the time  A lot  This was supposed to be  On sale  You advertise this  As being  Seventy eight cents  And why am I paying  Eighty five cents  If  I will punch you  In the uterus  And leave the change  In there  You bitch  Move  It is a big inconvenience  They're all  It's all about  Me me me  You're not that important  Pay the extra money 
[04:40:30]  And leave  It's not like ten dollars  Is it something  It's seven cents  Stockings are hung  On the chimney  And the presents  Are under the tree  And mama's in the kitchen  Making some  Herbal tea  The windows are covered  With frost  And the candles  Are all alive  But as I wander  Through this quiet house  Something just doesn't 
[04:41:00]  Seem right  You see  Every year  The neighbors bring us  A Swiss colony  Beef love  But the neighbors  Aren't around  Around  Around  There's no beef love  To be found  This year  No beef love  Christmas 
[04:41:30]  Is it Christmas  Without a Swiss  Girl  And a beef love  Without those  Jesus enemies  I don't think  I can get along  Mother tries  To comfort me  She says  Her son  Had some eggnog  But I fucking  Hate eggnog  Seriously  But what  Do I see  Underneath

[04:45:00]  We'll be right back. 
[04:45:30]  We'll be right back. 
[04:46:00]  We'll be right back. 
[04:46:30]  We'll be right back. 
[04:47:00]  We'll be right back. 
[04:47:30]  Do anything without noticing how gay he is now.  The hand on the hip.  He is very gay.  The left hand being this while the right arm is akimbo on the hip.  You cannot notice.  Peter, Peter, why don't you slip this sexy little night shirt on, Peter?  Because it's no fun unless I can pull something up in the back.  That's why all the Brady boys wear the night shirts.  He just gave up acting straight.  Because I think in the original series, I don't think you can tell at all, but you're right. 
[04:48:00]  These later episodes and specials that came out, he just said, ask.  I am what I am, and here it is.  Those scenes where he's laying in bed with Carol at the end of the show, doing the little show closer,  and they have to make like they're a loving married couple.  It's like, oh my, oh, Carol, come here.  Let me give you a kiss, I guess.  I can smell that vagina from up here. 
[04:48:30]  Mind if I sleep in the boys' room tonight, Carol?  Greg, do you think I could shove that big horse sculpture at the bottom of the stairs on my ass?  Let's try.  There's one scene where one of the Brady kids, like one of their kids,  like whether it was Marsh's little eight-year-old red-headed son,  slid down the banister and Robert Reed was at the bottom to catch him. 
[04:49:00]  I'll catch you.  Come on down.  Oh, he's coming so fast.  And so am I.  Oh, yeah.  I love those boys.  Stupid.  Girls, you okay?  All right, good night.  Hi, boys.  Let me tuck in and read you a little story.  Once upon a time, there was a homosexual actor playing a dad.  Well, I understand that he would molest Bobby and Greg,  but he wouldn't molest Peter because Peter wasn't mechanically inclined. 
[04:49:30]  Peter, why don't you put on the Phil Packer mustache you wore in episode 33  and, you know, tickle my little member down here with that mustache.  All right, boys, we're going to play Steal the Playbook.  I put it in my pants.  Now you boys got to steal it so Greg can read the plays. 
[04:50:00]  I've rolled up these plans and put them in this tube.  Now you've got to hide them in me.  It's Christmas we're talking about.  Now, beware. 
[04:50:30]  I'll cover you with Fast Eddie's underwear.  Well, I'll eat your mammy's panties and tell your mom to come to me  and come to my prom.  It's in outer space.  That's where my sleigh can fly to.  Goodbye.  Excuse you.  Can I come back and say the rest of it?  It's Christmas, kids, and you're going to love it. 
[04:51:00]  Gravy dripping all over me.  Christmas is good, but only when I come to your house and you've been good.  Christmas comes to everyone in every neighborhood.  Oh, yeah, Christmas is back to see Christmas lying on its back.  Get back to work, bitch, with me on top.  And don't you ever, ever pull the lever that's at stop.  Santa cooked your Christmas in his hobbit hole.  Oh, yeah, yo, Lord.  Santa cooked your Christmas in his hobbit hole. 
[04:51:30]  Oh, yeah, yo, Lord.  Yeah, you know, it is what it is, so.  Whoa.  Took a big old dump in a Pringles can.  Now I'm wiping off my ass.  Forget about my hand.  I'm ready to do it.  Get in my sleigh.  My sack's filled with fluid.  I'm bringing joy to my elves.  Don't put it by me.  Pleasures I won't deny there, heinie.  My armpits will sweat when I see that long-haired elf coming out of his corvette. 
[04:52:00]  Even though it's old and it's got a little scratch, it don't matter.  I just love to lick his patch on his chest.  You'll catch me red-handed.  Douglas, I'm the Christmas bandit.  Topsoil plant.  Don't you love the taste of a beaver when it hesitates.  Santa cooked your Christmas in his hobbit hole.  Oh, yeah, yo, Lord.  Santa cooked your Christmas in his hobbit hole.  Oh, yeah, yo, Lord. 
[04:52:30]  Santa cooked your Christmas in his hobbit hole.  Oh, yeah, yo, Lord.  Santa cooked your Christmas in his hobbit hole.  Oh, yeah, yo, Lord.  For this Christmas, you're going nuts.  Oh, yeah, yo, Lord.  Get me out of this now.  Oh, yeah, yo, Lord.  That made no sense.  Oh, yeah, yo, Lord.  Fill you up with plasorous nutrients like a worm hatch. 
[04:53:00]  Santa cooked your Christmas in his hobbit hole.  Oh, yeah, yo, Lord.  Santa cooked your Christmas in his hobbit hole.  Oh, yeah, yo, Lord.  And it all happened at the company Christmas party? 
[04:53:30]  Oh, yeah.  The worst.  It's the worst.  Of the Ovi and Anthony Show.  All right, ladies and gentlemen.  Listen up and listen up then.  I'm going to sing you, I love the real song, which is all Chris Crankle McCarthy. 
[04:54:00]  Once upon a time, Chris Crankle stole.  He beat a memory part from my house.  He used a screwdriver to give me the lock.  After that, he didn't jump into the stolen car and started up the motor.  He drove away the stolen car in half a suit.  Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle.  Chris Crankle was a car thief. 
[04:54:30]  Chris Crankle spread down what's full of them out there near the hospital street looking  for a curse.  He was fired while he was fired.  When the Chicago police officers spotted the stolen memory, as it soon passed them, they  turned on their siren.  Then they went out to defeat the stolen memory.  Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle was a car thief. 
[04:55:00]  Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris Crankle, Chris

[05:01:00]  Merry Christmas, I don't want to fight tonight with you. 
[05:01:30]  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  I'm going to be right back.  Hey, man.  Did you hear that?  Hey, everybody.  Santa's here.  Oh, there ain't no Santa Claus.  Yes, there is.  There is, too, man.  Here.  Here.  Oh, Merry Christmas, boys.  Oh, shit. 
[05:02:00]  Red Peter.  Come on, you swinging hamsters.  Get over here.  We're going to sing us a happy Christmas song.  Oh, no.  Not another corny stupid song.  Yeah, no way.  Yeah, you tell him, brother.  Yeah, no way.  No way.  Get over here and sing or I'll ring your little neck.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  So grab your nuts, hamsters, gather round with me.  Forget about all that teasing.  We're breaking out the holly and aluminum tree,  because it's that jolly season. 
[05:02:30]  Oh, boy.  I know you've been naughty, but have you been nice?  That's only Santa's business.  That's right, Red.  He's making his list and he's checking it twice.  Holy shit, it's Christmas.  Santa comes just once a year.  Tell him it's just like you, Red.  That's what we need.  Hey, wait a minute.  He's got a soft spot for reindeer.  Oh, it looks nice.  Especially Rudolph's barriere.  Hey, knock it off, fellas, it's a holiday.  Go on and give Santa a big kiss. 
[05:03:00]  No way.  You can play hide the hamster on a one-horse sleigh.  Hey, wait a moment.  Holy shit, it's Christmas.  Hey, what happened to my lyric sheet?  Anyone seen my lyrics?  Heck, we don't need no lyric sheets, Red.  We know our parts by heart.  Right, fellas?  Yeah, sure.  I know my parts by heart.  Yeah, me too.  Well, that's great, guys.  I love Christmas songs. 
[05:03:30]  Santa tried reaching out the neighbor's blouse.  After drinking all the eggs out.  Is that necessary?  He can't out in the bathroom for an hour or two.  Squashing off a yule.  God free!  We wandered in his undies all over the house.  But we find it our own business.  Till we caught us up and answers up and get trapped, too.  Holy shit, it's Christmas.  Santa comes just once a year.  Up the chimney, he'll disappear. 
[05:04:00]  Keep on the lookout for Mr. Gear.  Hamster's a little ring in the hair.  Roast nuts chest and on an open fire.  Santa's tongue stuck to the door.  No, no, no, no.  What?  His balls got funneled by a caroling choir  while the parson gave him a hint.  What?  The sleigh came down and took him away.  The whole damn crowd was dismissed.  Cause it's time to be dolly and it's time to be gay. 
[05:04:30]  Holy shit, it's Christmas.  Holy shit, it's Christmas.  Holy shit, it's Christmas.  All right, how you doin'?  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  It's Christmas.  Uh, yeah, I was just listening to your station a little while ago.  Yeah.  And I had my three-year-old son with me and you guys were putting down the Santa Claus thing  and, oh, it's just your parents and all that.  Yeah.  And, you know, I was, I like, I love Opie and Anthony, you know, and I'm a faithful listener, 
[05:05:00]  but, uh, I had to change the station.  Oh, that's okay.  You're, you're doing parenting, that's called, when you change the station.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, wait, I, I detect that you're a little pissed at us cause we just said that there's  no Santa Claus on the air.  Well, it'd be one thing if it was, you know, a little later at night and there wouldn't  happen to have been someone's kid listening, you know?  Dude, I'd just save you, uh, the, the hassle.  Now you could get the credit for all those presents you bought for him.  Did we traumatize him?  No, you didn't, actually.  He, he, I changed the station in time where he didn't pick up on it cause he was busy 
[05:05:30]  doing something else.  Hey, what's your, uh, son's name?  It's Jeffrey.  Can I, uh, talk to him real fast?  Uh, why, what are you gonna say?  I just wanted to say hi to him.  You're not gonna say anything bad, are ya?  Oh, I wouldn't do that.  Yeah, are you sure?  Yeah.  I hope not.  Alright, where's Jeffrey?  I'll, I'll get him.  He don't, he don't really talk much on the phone, but.  What's your wife saying in the background?  Oh, she wasn't too happy about it when I told her.  She wasn't listening, but.  Oh, wait, wait.  Barb, chill out. 
[05:06:00]  Oh, I don't.  Okay, hey, Jeffrey, somebody wants to talk to you on the phone?  Those guys we were listening to on the radio?  I'm on the floor first.  He's, he's, he's got a measuring tape.  He said he's measuring the floor first.  And your wife is mad at me for, for doing that?  I, he said something.  Oh, I better, I better talk to him and then smooth it over.  Okay, well, here, here he is, okay?  I'll give him the phone, but I don't know if he'll talk.  Alright.  Okay, here he is.  Here, Jeffrey, listen.  Listen to this guy on the radio.  He wants to talk to you.  Here.  Jeffrey, take it. 
[05:06:30]  Come here.  Come here for a break.  Let me get him on my lap.  Jeffrey, come here.  Come here.  Just listen to what this guy has to say to you.  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  Jeffrey, there's no Santa Claus.  That's your dad.  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Heartless.  Ziggy, do you know any Christmas songs?  Yeah, I know a Christmas song.  A lot older.  You want to sing one real fast for us?  I think I can sing it.  Alright, let's go.  I didn't have him pegged as an alto. 
[05:07:00]  On yon virgin, mother and child, holy infant so tender and mild, sleep in heavenly peace.  Sleep in heavenly peace.
