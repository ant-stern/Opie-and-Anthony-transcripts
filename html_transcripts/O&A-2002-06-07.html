<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a celebratory look back at their one-year anniversary of syndication on Philadelphia's 94 WYSP.  This involved playing old audio clips from their initial days on the station, showcasing initially negative listener reactions and contrasting them with their current success. A particularly lengthy and humorous segment featured a caller who remained on the phone with the show while simultaneously listening to the broadcast, creating a noticeable delay and frustrating interaction.  The hosts also discussed their upcoming return to a Seattle station and announced upcoming guests: Tyson Lewis, Jim Gaffigan, and Kreskin.  A significant portion of the early show focused on a dissection of Kreskin's UFO prediction, ultimately debunking it as likely caused by flares.  Studio guest Dustin Diamond ("Screech") joined the show, sharing anecdotes, including a humorous story about feeding rats with the hosts.  Numerous advertisements punctuated these segments.

The show then transitioned to discussions about upcoming events, including their appearance and live broadcast at the River Rave in Boston.  The hosts engaged in banter about professional wrestling, specifically Stevie Richards and Shawn Michaels's WWE return.  A substantial portion focused on MC Hammer's financial troubles, blaming an excessively large and allegedly exploitative entourage.  This segued into a broader, highly offensive discussion about the financial mismanagement common among celebrities, especially rappers and boxers, often attributed to their large entourages. The hosts used highly offensive racial slurs and stereotypes throughout this discussion.  Jennifer Lopez's separation from her husband was briefly touched upon, leading to speculation about a possible reconciliation with Puff Daddy and a discussion of Puff Daddy’s extravagant spending habits.  The conversation also included jokes about the poor quality of MC Hammer's cartoon, "Hammer Man."

A phone call with Kreskin followed, centering on his UFO prediction. Kreskin insisted on its success despite contradictory evidence. He described a large gathering witnessing something in the sky, attributing it to a new form of psychological warfare. The hosts and callers challenged his claims, highlighting inconsistencies and lack of evidence. The conversation grew confrontational, with accusations of lying and fabrication, and Kreskin remained evasive, frequently altering his account.  The hosts concluded the segment expressing disbelief and frustration. More commercial breaks were interspersed.

The debunking of Kreskin's UFO prediction continued, with listeners contributing to the ridicule, attributing the sightings to airplanes and possible light displays.  The show then abruptly shifted to the hosts’ $21,000 FCC fine for indecent broadcasts, specifically referencing a segment involving a girl performing oral sex on her father, a phone-in segment with a girl putting a phone in her pants, and a pedophilia parody song.  The hosts and guests discussed the details of the complaints and the implications of the fine.  Studio guests Dustin Diamond and Jim Gaffigan then shared anecdotes: Diamond discussed his *Saved by the Bell* experiences, and Gaffigan briefly spoke about his acting career.  More advertisements aired throughout this segment.

The show continued with a chaotic and rambling segment.  The hosts, along with Gaffigan and Diamond, struggled to maintain a coherent discussion.  Negative listener calls, using highly offensive language and wishing harm on the hosts and guests, prompted co-host Norton to temporarily leave the studio.  Diamond recounted his celebrity boxing match against Arnold Horshack, detailing a broken pre-fight agreement to avoid head punches.  The show announced a new sponsor, a New Orleans gay bar named Oz, which led to further off-color jokes.  Gaffigan’s attempts at humor largely fell flat amidst the chaos.  The conversation repeatedly devolved into sexually explicit and offensive topics, including discussions about pedophilia (often in the context of the FCC complaint), genitalia, bodily functions, and other taboo subjects.  Gaffigan even shared a personal anecdote about taking self-portraits during masturbation, and the hosts engaged in a lengthy, tangential discussion about facial hair.  The overall tone was highly unprofessional and sexually charged, largely focused on reacting to negative listener feedback and unsuccessfully attempting to regain control.

The final segment began with the announcement of their "Best Wow" photo contest, sponsored by RisqueVideo.com, offering a $5,000 prize and encouraging women to submit creative photos.  The contest was to begin Monday at their WBBN Boston location.  Jim Gaffigan remained a studio guest, and his upcoming performances at the Stress Factory were promoted.  Further banter, described by the hosts as somewhat uncomfortable, ensued between the hosts and Gaffigan.  A large number of advertisements ran, including those for Progress Bank, Stacker 2, the History Channel's "Secret Passages," the Old Bridge Township Raceway Park, Robbins Delaware Diamonds, *The Bourne Identity*, Tweeter, Comedy Central's *Crank Yankers*, Captain Morgan rum, and Payroll Data.  A Jersey Shore weather forecast was also included. The broadcast concluded with a "What Did We Learn" segment, where hosts and callers humorously recapped the show, highlighting Gaffigan's awkwardness, the show’s poor quality, and other crude observations.

You just said hello, you dick.  This is way off, huh?  Hey, dude, dude, dude.  Oh, my God.  He's listening to the radio.  Dude, dude.  We're not talking about sticker stops anymore.  You're live on the air.  What an ass.  Hey, stupid. 
[00:04:00]  Turn the radio off.  You know how annoying this is, but it intrigues me every time.  All right.  I got to finish it and see where it goes.  Well, we're going to say hi to him in a second here.  Yeah, listen.  Let's listen.  We're on like a two-minute delay or something.  Let's listen.  All right.  To the guy that has the phone to his ear and he's listening to the radio at the same time,  we are talking to you now.  I want to hear him answer it.  I want to hear him answer it when we go to the phone.  All right.  He's listening because then he'll hear his name and go, huh? 
[00:04:30]  He's going to answer himself.  I'm not comfortable with that.  Brian?  Not yet.  Here he goes.  Come on.  Wow, what a delay in Boston, huh?  They don't trust us at all anymore in Boston.  I thought the delay in New York was bad.  He'll hear his name soon, and then he'll start answering the radio like an idiot.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  Hey, y'all, don't worry.  Hey, Ken. 
[00:05:00]  Thanks for helping it down.  Here we go.  Hey, you're following me.  Okay.  Shh, shh, shh.  Let's listen.  All right.  There's the music back.  Now you took the call.  We got someone in Boston checking in.  Ryan, what's up?  What's up?  What's up?  You idiot.  What a dick bag.  Yeah.  What an ass.  I am.  What a dick.  Yeah.  Ryan.  Shut up.  How are you?  Hello. 
[00:05:30]  What?  What an idiot you are, dude.  I can't hear you on my phone.  My phone isn't the greatest phone in the world.  Well, well, well, jackass, Ryan, don't you realize that...  Hey, stupid, I have the radio off.  You still fucking do it.  Holy fool.  That is great.  Is he still there?  Ryan.  Ryan.  I know you're talking to me. 
[00:06:00]  My phone stinks.  Hello.  He's still talking to the radio.  Yeah.  Ryan.  Hello.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Ryan.  On the phone, stupid.  On the phone, you idiot.  He's talking to...  Who talks to their radio?  No one talks to their radio.  You're on the phone with them.  Oh.  Yeah.  You.  I love...  Yeah, you're funny. 
[00:06:30]  Listen, he's talking to the radio.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Oh, my God.  He's still...  It's going to go around again.  I know.  When we talk to him again.  Will he be smart enough to hear himself and go, hey, me.  That's me.  Wait a minute.  I'm talking to me, too.  Yeah, there's where it happened.  What is that?  Hey, Ryan.  Ryan.  Ryan. 
[00:07:00]  Ryan.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Ryan.  Ryan, don't you realize that...  So, now we're off the riddick, you're lost.  Now he's laughing at himself.  Hey, uh...  Hey, Ryan.  Ryan.  Oh, funny. 
[00:07:30]  What a bunch of idiots.  What did he say?  What did he say?  He goes, oh, funny.  What a bunch of idiots.  Brian.  Brian.  Yeah.  He's still answering to the radio.  He's answering to the radio.  You are the biggest tool we've ever had on the air.  Brian.  Brian.  Hello.  Yes.  Yeah.  But answer us.  Brian.  On the phone.  Mike.  Hey, Brian.  Brian.  I did. 
[00:08:00]  You filmed the phone.  Listen.  I can't hear you through the phone.  Why?  Just want to tell you.  The Celtics are going to spank the Knicks, and Jason Kidd is a life beater.  Oh, what a dope.  What a moron.  Knicks.  They're not even playing the Knicks.  That's classic, though.  That is classic.  What a complete ass.  There you go, Boston.  Looking good. 
[00:08:30]  Looking good.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Friday.  Here's the air appointment.  That's the air appointment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mama, I want Minnie.  Mama, I want Minnie.  Yeah.  And sorry about that, Anthony. 
[00:09:00]  That's all right.  And welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oink.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area.  877-692-1027.  Give us a call.  We'd love to hear from you today.  Anywhere else, including, it may surprise you.  Yes.  Philly.  Philly.  What's up, Philly?  Hey, Philly.  Outside of New York, including Philadelphia.  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW. 
[00:09:30]  This is a prime, my, where has the time gone moment.  Right here, right now.  Can you believe it, O.P.?  We're saying hi to Philly because a year ago today, W.Y.S.P. in Philadelphia picked up  the O.P. and Anthony Show in syndication.  Yeah.  They said it wouldn't last.  This was a year ago today.  We're now a year into syndication.  And some people, boy, some people didn't think we'd finish out the week. 
[00:10:00]  And now we're in something like 22 cities or something like that.  But Philly was the first one.  It started a year ago.  So, and thank God and thank the people of Philly.  We're doing very, very good in Philly.  That's right.  Thanks to some fine people like Tim Sabian, who's on hold.  Before we get him on the air, though, Anthony.  Yeah.  We had Stinky go through the show a year ago when we first started syndication.  Yeah. 
[00:10:30]  And he picked out some calls that we were getting from Philly.  Oh, a couple of the calls welcoming us to Philly.  Those warm, friendly, cuddly, welcome to Philly calls we got a year ago.  Yeah.  Would you like to hear Tim Sabian from a year ago?  Oh, that's right.  We called him right when we got on the air.  Right.  The program director of WYSP.  So this is pretty much exactly to the minute a year ago.  And this is how it went down as we started our syndication.  Tim.  You. 
[00:11:00]  Hey.  Tim Sabian, the PD of WYSP.  Tim.  What's happening?  How's it working?  Are we number one yet?  That's all he cares about.  I saw all your quotes in the Philadelphia papers today, you bastard.  The self-centered, selfish person that I am?  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Are we number one yet?  Not yet.  Okay.  Give us till next Thursday.  See, he doesn't care.  It's just product B or product C or whatever the hell is in this time slot.  That's all he cares about.  That's right.  Tim, what's the vibe down there?  It's big.  It's big.  It's big? 
[00:11:30]  It's big.  We have a lot of people listening today?  Everybody's in the hall, up and down.  It's just a buzz.  It's buzzing.  Great.  And they're saying, be funny.  Have they come into your office yet and said, well, they're really not doing anything yet.  It's been nine minutes.  Right.  You know, where's the funny stuff?  It's on the way.  But, yeah.  Everyone's psyched down there?  It is great.  It is welcome to Philadelphia.  This is a historic day at WYSP once again.  And we're looking forward to doing whatever it takes. 
[00:12:00]  And we will be big in afternoons.  This is huge.  Huge.  We don't know if it's history like...  It's huge.  History like inventing a serum for a disease or history like a building collapse.  But it's going to be history one way.  Ant said that a year ago today.  I'm like Kreskin.  I was predicting the future.  That's pretty freaky, man.  Sorry, I picked that one.  It's about building an audience and just taking care of business here.  And are we number one yet?  Not yet. 
[00:12:30]  But...  Oh, my God.  This guy's just going to be on our ass the whole time, Opie.  He's going to be on our ass the whole time.  Well, we know what phone call we're not going to take too often.  Not with your help, Tim.  Yeah, Tim.  Well, the ONA virus has spread to Philadelphia.  What can I tell you?  It's just...  It's intense.  It's intense.  Thank you, Tim.  All right, Tim.  Great statement.  Great quotes.  Anything you guys need?  No.  We got two lovely ladies from Philadelphia.  We got the care package and we're pretty psyched.  All right.  Hey, what song was supposed to be playing right now today? 
[00:13:00]  Right now, Aerosmith.  Oops.  Sorry.  Sorry, Aerosmith.  All right.  Thanks, Tim.  We got to do a show, okay?  All right.  Congratulations.  And there you have it.  A year ago today.  That was the phone call.  That's how our syndication started.  That was it.  That was like the first break we did.  With a very boring phone call from Tim Sabine.  Yeah.  A year later, they're still waiting for us to be funny in Philly.  Look, I know.  I've known Tim for a year now. 
[00:13:30]  And that call, you could hear how nervous he was.  His voice was like, yeah, it's going to be great.  The vibe.  Oh, yeah, great.  And everyone's listening.  In the back of his mind, he's like, oh, this better work or I'm out of a job.  He was going through bailout plans in his head.  Yeah.  All right.  When this tanks, I'll be able to go back to music.  I'll do this.  But lo and behold, wow.  Philly embraced us, Opie.  Pope DX from Philly.  Hey, why aren't you here for the one-year anniversary?  We should be in Philly today, Anthony. 
[00:14:00]  Wow.  But we committed to the River Rave.  We're going to Boston right after the show tonight.  Can't wait to go to Boston for the River Rave.  So we committed to that a long time ago, and it was just one of those things.  We'll get down to Philly soon, though, right?  Are we going to get calls?  You guys won't be here a year and two months.  You want to hear the first Philly caller?  Ah, yeah.  You want to explain this to the other cities?  Because this is exactly what happened when we moved back to New York City four years ago. 
[00:14:30]  To New York, Philly, every city that accepts this program, the first day we're on the air, we get calls like this.  It's people that just do not want to accept something new.  They've listened to minutes of the program and decided they think it sucks.  So we take the calls because it's kind of funny because we know how this is going to end.  We know we're going to do well and have fun with the people in those cities. 
[00:15:00]  But right off the bat, people get a little edgy, and they don't like change.  Especially because we haven't done anything yet.  This call came in 15 minutes into the program.  Yeah, we talked to Tim.  I wonder if this guy, Tom, was the first Philly caller.  I wonder if Tom is still listening today.  Well, if he is, we'll be able to tell if his voice is the same or something.  Because I'd love to talk to Tom.  See if he still hates us.  Yeah, well, he might.  Who knows?  Here's Tom, the first Philly caller, as we went into syndication a year ago today. 
[00:15:30]  Do you want to go to Tom, who's calling from Philadelphia?  Tom!  Yeah.  Hey.  Our first call from Philadelphia.  Yeah, your first call from Philadelphia?  The first call from Philadelphia is telling you we don't want you guys here.  You're trash.  I love it.  I can already tell you you're trash.  There we go.  How could you tell after 15 minutes?  Because you guys aren't funny at all.  Well, give it some time.  Give you some time.  I want to listen to rock and roll.  I don't want to listen to more people talking.  There's a million talk stations in Philadelphia.  And there's a million radio stations playing music, right, Tom?  Yeah.  Well, we want music.  Why is that? 
[00:16:00]  It's the best rock station.  We want to listen to rock all over again.  We don't want to listen to white trash people from New York.  You stay in New York.  You should have stayed in New York.  Don't try coming around here.  Oh, no.  Hey, Tom.  What?  What song are you missing right now?  Aerosmith, like Tim just said.  I think they would have been into the next song by now.  Well, they would have been playing Led Zeppelin then.  All right.  You guys are white trash.  Just order us to it.  What Led Zeppelin song?  Let me see.  Dire Mares, some stuff.  Yeah.  Haven't you heard that enough, Tom?  No.  Well, I don't want to.  No one in Philly wants to hear. 
[00:16:30]  Well, no one in Philly wants to listen to you guys.  Yeah.  You just wait and see it, all right, Tom?  Yeah.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  No, I'm not going to wait.  We'll obviously be talking to him as the weeks go on.  We told him to wait and see, and we did pretty well in Philly so far.  I'd like to hear his opinion now.  Yeah.  I'd like to know after a year if he just stopped listening.  I don't know.  I'd like to hear from him.  Yes, Jim.  You know how you knew he was an ass?  Because he said, we don't want to hear no talk.  You want to hear rock and roll. 
[00:17:00]  We've heard that so many times.  Whenever we take over a music slot, man, it's brutal.  They're used to it.  Who refers to it as rock and roll?  Rock and roll.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Alan Freed's rock and roll show.  Rock and roll.  You don't talk.  I got the second call from Tim Sabian.  Don't worry.  We're not going to spend all day on this, just this first break.  But Tim Sabian calling back early in the program a year ago as we went into syndication. 
[00:17:30]  Tim.  I don't want to speak too loudly here.  What's the matter?  I'll be leaving out through the alley door.  Tim, you were so excited an hour and a half.  I was.  What happened?  And I still am.  Okay.  What happened?  Oh, please.  Are you fielding a lot of phone calls there?  Yeah.  We told you about this, Tim.  It's called the purge.  This is the purge.  The first phase.  We're so experienced with this.  When did the binge come?  You should be binging right now.  Don't you worry about a thing.  Okay. 
[00:18:00]  Tim, can you tell us some of the phone calls you're getting so far?  Where's the Van Halen?  Uh-huh.  Where's the Aerosmith?  Uh-huh.  Where's Cousin Ed?  Uh-huh.  These guys suck.  Right.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Where's the Van Halen?  Uh-huh.  Where's the Aerosmith?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  These guys suck.  Where's...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was there one promising call, Tim?  Uh-huh.  Yes, there was.  Just to give us a little hope?  Yeah.  Ken said, how you doing?  I said, it's going great.  Good.  Ken, of course, the boss of both stations.  Absolutely. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  You had to be prepared for this.  Absolutely.  Come on.  You're going from music to this drivel?  Let me tell you something.  It's over the top.  It's going all the way to number one.  I think at this point, Tim's like, oh, my God.  They don't do anything.  I don't know.  What happened?  What happened?  They said it was a fun show.  I don't know what happened.  Wait.  I thought they did things.  Did we get the Opie and Anthony or one of them?  Like Gallagher 2?  You know how Gallagher goes out and his brother goes out as Gallagher 2? 
[00:19:00]  Did we get Opie and Anthony 2?  Yeah.  So when did the real Opie and Anthony show up?  Yeah.  When did they smash the watermelon?  He's thinking to himself, because he heard the whole show yesterday, maybe they're just still  hungover from those nine bottles of champagne from yesterday.  You want us to do some shots of Jaeger?  Oh, let's go.  Yeah, you're right.  You're ready.  Let's slam them.  I'll do that.  Set them up.  Let's knock them down.  All right, Tim.  We're going to check in from time to time just to make sure everything's okay.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  What memories? 
[00:19:30]  There was Tim's, he sounded a little more nervous.  He'd probably been just getting bludgeoned in the office.  With hate calls.  With hate calls.  Yeah.  People that want to hear the music.  Now we've got all these nice memories with Philly.  Oh, my God.  This is just the beginning.  The first day in syndication.  The road show.  The Norton shows that we've done.  Unbelievable.  The concert Kid Rock show we just went to recently.  Right.  And it's amazing hearing that first call, but no one understood the juicy lima bean buttocks 
[00:20:00]  that were waiting.  Here's the second Philly call.  Uh-oh.  A year ago today as we were trying to do our first show in syndication for Philadelphia.  Any better?  No.  And then we have one more Sabian call and then we move on.  Okay.  Hello?  Anthony, they're saying we got a positive call on the line.  Yes, Chris from Philly.  Chris, I'm calling from Newton.  Yeah.  Okay, I'm listening off 94.1.  Yeah, that would be WYSP in Philadelphia.  Yeah, I was in my car. 
[00:20:30]  I'm trying to get some music on and I hear this crap.  Okay.  Are you going to be spinning records at all?  Yeah, a little bit, sure.  You're spinning them in front of us.  Because I don't need, why do you have to talk all that much?  You're not even saying anything important.  Oh.  Exactly.  You got the show now.  It's a big out of Philly listener that figured out the show.  I just want to hear some music and then I get this garbage.  Chris, what can we play for you today?  What do you want to hear?  How about the Van Halen?  Ah.  Or is that too much of a problem?  You haven't heard enough Van Halen in your life or what?  Why don't you just play some? 
[00:21:00]  It's a music station.  Maybe you should play some music.  But haven't you heard all the Van Halen?  Well, look, you got Cousin Ed on and then you got this crap.  He plays music.  Why can't you?  Cousin Ed's still rocking.  Sure.  Why can't we play music?  You know, sir, why don't you get into a warm bath, open your veins and play Brown Eyed  Girl, you white trash rock and roll lover.  Shut up.  Who the hell is that?  Hey, Jim Norton's in the studio.  Yeah, why don't you talk about something interesting?  Play some music, at least.  Play some music.  Yeah, you know, it was funny the first time I heard it.  Drink A to the picnic. 
[00:21:30]  Hey, Chris.  Yeah.  You didn't enjoy the game What's in My Pants?  I was trying, you know, it would be cool if I hadn't heard it a thousand times on other  shows before.  I don't think you've heard that before.  You've heard What's in My Pants?  Very similar.  You've heard Wood Floor and Mohawk?  And Mohawk?  And that's an O&A Ramsey?  I'm insulted because that's an O&A original.  Yeah, it's the first time anybody's done something like that.  Of course, Chris.  Get the hell out of here.  All right.  I need to talk to you.  Yeah, all right.  I'm all right.  Jim, we'll be looking forward to Chris's calls in weeks to come. 
[00:22:00]  That's right.  Because they always call back.  Wow.  Oof.  That guy was a little brutal.  He annoyed me again.  Yeah, all over again.  I want to hear, like, spin some records.  It's like a year ago.  All over again.  Who spins records in this day and age?  There he goes.  You guys don't talk about anything.  Well, you figure this out.  Good.  First day out.  First day, and the guy completely got the show.  You guys aren't talking about anything.  Yeah.  Sorry.  That's what you get.  All right.  I'll wrap it up. 
[00:22:30]  Tim Sabian called back one more time a year ago today as we started syndication.  Checking up on us.  To Philly.  Now let's talk to the Tim Sabian at 5.53.  I hate these guys.  Will you ever play Ozzy Osbourne?  It just doesn't stop.  Well, you had to know that when you put us in place of music that people love, that you're going to get some flack.  Yeah, but...  Tim?  You know, it's funny for the first ten minutes. 
[00:23:00]  Will you ever play Ozzy Osbourne?  Will you ever play Van Halen?  These guys suck.  It's a mantra.  Are you reading feedbacks or just telling us this?  No, I'm just off the top of my head now.  Is that just you talking about it?  The beaten Tim Sabian.  What'd you think?  Are you the only one left in the studio now down there?  Yeah, that's it.  Just me, the janitor.  Everyone's fled.  Man, you sound beaten. 
[00:23:30]  This poor guy.  It's been a long day.  I got audio, Anthony, of Tim Sabian as he tries to get his job back after this...  Oh, really?  This train wreck.  Yes.  Would you like to hear it?  Let's hear.  Let's listen to Tim Sabian.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Is it that bad, Tim?  Oh, my God.  It's really... 
[00:24:00]  It's weighing on you, isn't it?  Oh, wait.  We have Tim's boss on the phone.  Yeah?  Hello?  You're fired!  Wow, it is bad.  If one sound effect could sum up us in Philly, I think it's this.  Oh, yeah.  No?  What could help?  But...  Oh. 
[00:24:30]  Anthony, I have more audio from Tim Sabian's boss.  What are you people?  On dope?  Tim?  Yes.  Tim, comment.  Comment, Tim.  It hurts.  Uh-oh.  Tim's boss on the phone.  Jeez, this guy doesn't give up.  Your days of finger...  Old Mary Jane Rottencroft threw her pretty pink panties are over!  Hey, here's the new, uh, program director. 
[00:25:00]  Never here, Smith is here.  Ah, you poor bastard.  Here's Tim trying to explain this whole mess to his, uh, his, his boss, Anthony.  I got, I got thought of a kind of brain.  Here's him trying to describe the show to his boss.  It's gonna make you puke!  Tim's boss.  Go!  Ask yourself!  Is this kind of, um, what's going on? 
[00:25:30]  Exactly.  Right to the T.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Tim.  Feel bad for him now.  Maybe tomorrow will be better.  I'll have two Jägermeisters and I'll forget about everything.  All right.  Well, here's Tim's boss.  Man, you are one pathetic loser.  All right.  Tim, you're the only one not laughing. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, thanks for slowing up my life.  That's okay.  Tim's boss, Anthony.  Get on your hands and knees like a dog.  That's it.  Crawl around like a dog.  You see?  You see?  You're stupid minds.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Tim, would you like to give out the address for the complaint letters that we'll be following?  Ah, very good.  I'll have a P.O. box and a 1-800 number. 
[00:26:30]  All right.  Well, thank you, Tim.  All right.  Hang in there.  I've got to go back to packing.  Okay.  Oh.  There he goes.  The man responsible for this.  Just remember, I've got two kids and a mortgage.  And we understand.  Thank you, Tim.  All right.  Thanks.  The guy responsible for wrecking your radio station.  That's so great.  How miserable does he sound?  There you go, Anthony.  It was a year ago today.  We started syndication to Philly.  We sure got away with a lot more a year ago. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  You hear all the new beats in our bits?  Scumbags.  Hear that?  Boy, that was a year ago.  We got away with a lot more a year ago than we do now.  God, I hate that.  Whose decision is that?  Who says that now you have to beat that?  I don't know.  And it's ridiculous.  Anyway, though, let's talk to Tim really fast.  Tim!  Oh.  Yes, Tim?  Swimming champagne.  Oh, is that what you're doing?  You're just drinking the champagne now?  From a year ago, you guys are up 176% with men 25-54. 
[00:27:30]  Look at that.  36% over the second-rated station.  134% with men 18-49 from a year ago.  152% over the growth from a year ago in men 18-34.  He certainly did.  It's huge.  Tim, now, a year later, I think you can be a little honest, that first day when we were  calling you up, and you were being very nice on the phone and very supportive, what were 
[00:28:00]  you really thinking as far as the phone calls you were getting and how this show would perform  on your station?  I figured there's got to be another radio station in the country someplace that would  hire me.  It was that bad, right?  There was a couple of weeks, about two months of fielding phone calls and letters and, you  know.  Yeah.  This show really, really sucks out of the box.  It really does.  Because we were listening to the first show we did for Philly, and I'm surprised anyone  is still listening to us.  We gave you guys nothing.  We were horrendous. 
[00:28:30]  It was a little nerve-wracking, too.  It was our first city that we were syndicated in.  Yeah.  So even though you're just sitting in here doing the same show you've done, on my mind  is, oh my God, people are listening.  They hate us.  I'll tell you something.  Stinky listened to the whole first show.  You guys suck.  Yeah.  Bring Stinky in real fast.  Stinky, who now has grown balls.  It wasn't even funny.  But look how great it turned out.  I smoked five joints, and it still wasn't funny. 
[00:29:00]  Where's the young Garrett?  Oh, he's in the bathroom?  Oh, now he doesn't even hang on.  Because we gave Stinky the job of going through the first show to see if there's some stuff  we could play for everyone.  You know, the first caller's hating us and things like that.  He comes in, and he goes, I almost fell asleep.  Horrible.  It was awful.  Well, you know, it was one of those days.  Very nerve-wracking.  All right, Tim.  Well, thank you guys very much for a great year.  A year later, we're rocking and rolling.  When are you guys coming back? 
[00:29:30]  We've got to have a one-year celebration.  Yeah, we ought to do that.  Yeah, we've got to figure something out.  We've got to do it soon.  And thank you for Chicago.  Tim runs the Chicago station.  We're on, and we're now on 7 to 11 in Chicago, Anthony.  Yes.  On a regular basis, every night.  On a regular basis.  No more hockey interrupting us.  How great is that?  Hold on.  Stinky's in the studio.  Stinky, how bad was our first show to Philly?  Oh, it was a tense one.  Yeah.  People were coming by, and you had to introduce everyone again.  Oh, yeah, we were like...  Hey, Marco. 
[00:30:00]  He does this.  Instead of just doing the show, everything we did, we had to just spoon feed to everybody.  This is Joey Paisano.  He brings us food.  He owns a place called Paisano.  Here's Brother Joe.  He is my biological brother.  It was that bad?  Yeah.  We were over-explaining everything?  Oh, I can imagine...  We gave up on that like 10 markets ago.  I know.  We really did.  We were like, ah, screw it if they don't get it in Albany.  What are we going to do?  Here's a bit where we called out Butt Plug and looked for Butt Plugs. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, God damn.  Notice I'm saying Butt Plug, but the guy doesn't know what I'm saying.  Just in case you don't get it there in Philly.  Oh, we've come a long way.  Thanks, Dane.  All right, Tim.  We've got to do a real show now.  All right.  Congratulations.  We've got the greatest listers in Philadelphia and in Chicago.  Thank you, Philly.  We'll be back soon.  All right.  Hey, Tim.  Nope.  Oh.  Hey, Anthony, before we... 
[00:31:00]  By the way, Tim's still fielding those calls.  Before we take our first break, we're talking about syndication a little bit, which we don't  do often.  I want to say thank you to Dallas.  Dallas has decided to move our show down starting Monday.  Yep.  We're now going to do, I think, 7 to 11 in Dallas instead of being on in the middle  of the night.  And also, big news.  Are we allowed to announce...  I wouldn't yet, but I'm just saying...  No, this won't we're allowed to the listeners.  No, they're sending in an email.  I know, but I...  I'll just read this email.  Okay. 
[00:31:30]  Because nothing's official.  All right.  I could do that, right?  It's not saying anything of where or anything, right?  Scott from Seattle.  Specifically.  Dude, it's in an email.  Yeah.  How does this guy know?  It probably works in the industry.  What do you mean?  He probably works in the industry.  What do you mean?  Screw that.  It's like Voss's stupid questions from his tape yesterday.  I say we read this email, and that means we'll be on Monday instead of a few weeks down  the road.  Anyone in the industry here? 
[00:32:00]  I will just read this email.  I'll just read the email.  All right.  Ben's against it.  Remember, we were on a tiny little AM station in Seattle, right, Ant?  But it seemed we were getting a few callers, fans of the show, from Seattle.  It seemed like we had a little following, sure.  But they didn't think so.  No.  And they decided to boot our asses and move the station back to classic country.  Excuse me.  Classic country.  Ben is freaking out.  It's just an email.  Well, it doesn't say what? 
[00:32:30]  It doesn't say anything else.  Other people's jobs may be too.  Oh, well.  Oh, stop it.  Why is it on Monday?  Well, now they know.  Now they know.  It doesn't say anything else.  It's not specific.  So we got dumped really bad.  Yeah.  And we said we would be back.  And everyone had a laugh.  All our critics were laughing.  It wasn't, see, these guys stink and syndication.  They're getting stations dropped left and right, even though it was two.  It was Seattle and Austin. 
[00:33:00]  And we said we'd do something with Seattle that would make big news.  It was a crappy AM we were on.  All I'm saying is Scott from Seattle, nice on the re-syndication to Seattle.  Ah.  Guys can't wait until the, I won't give the day, see?  Didn't give the day.  Even though you're not live, it's still great to know that you'll be back on Seattle airwaves  again.  Mm-hmm.  And this is a much, much, much, much bigger station.  Much more gooder. 
[00:33:30]  Much more powerful-er.  All right.  So that's that.  And gooder.  And another city to announce in the very near future.  Mm.  All right.  Roll the dice.  Oh, oh, oh.  Didn't apply yesterday, but it applies in that sense.  Oh, very nice.  Certainly does.  There you go.  We're already on in Vegas.  I know.  Oh, hmm.  Oh, well, hmm.  Hmm.  Short flight.  Hmm.  I know her drive. 
[00:34:00]  Hmm.  Short flight.  Roll the dice in between taking some runs down the slope.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh.  Roll the dice, Naughton.  All right.  Lady Di and Marianne, Philly endorsement, 12 seconds.  We'll play this.  These guys are very cool.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Ready, go.  But Philly, these guys are very cool, and you'll get to know them.  You'll love them.  I'm sold.  You'll love them.  I'm sold.  That's right.  It's really out of here.  Just listen to them for a week and forget you guys will love them. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  Hey, there you go.  Wow, that must have sold it.  That must have put us over the top.  That put us over the top.  That awful Downs tongue lolling.  That's a big tongue.  I'm sick of a mess.  All right, Anthony, on the show today.  Yeah.  Screech in studio.  Well, Opie, can't you use his real name?  I don't know his real name.  He's Screech.  Dustin Diamond.  Oh, okay.  Should be nice to him, because he could kick your ass.  I know him.  I know him.  All right.  How do you know him?  I hung out with him when he came to New York.  We went and looked at rats together. 
[00:35:00]  You did?  Me, him, and Voss, and Bob Golub from LA.  Yeah.  And I heard he's a great stepfather.  What do you mean you looked at rats?  Me and Voss are lonely, so we'd go by this park by Broadway and just look at little rats  where we would feed rats.  And one of the things we did was when Dustin was here.  You really do have an awful life.  You fed rats with the...  Yeah, we would put the peanut butter out.  We would just sit in the car and watch them.  And Voss was such a cowardly, midget-fingered Jew that every time the rats would...  Every time the rats run out of the park, he would roll his window up.  Like, you scatmack.  They're going to jump.  They're not going to rappel into the car. 
[00:35:30]  You're going to climb up his teeth.  That's what he was frightened of.  They were running.  I was dodging them.  All right.  I heard that Dustin has a chess.  Yeah, he's a really good chess player.  He's a really good chess player.  And he was putting together something.  I've got to talk to him about this.  A comedy chess video.  Really?  Even though I was going, really?  I think it was coined Edutainment.  That's a song by Boogie Down Productions.  Oh, is it?  Yes.  Well, we'll have to talk about chess and comedy and how you tie those two things together. 
[00:36:00]  Wow.  I can't wait.  Well, you know, I'm a big chess fan.  Yes, you are, North.  Thank God Philly knows we gave him 364 days of great radio.  And then there's today.  So they'll stick with us through this mess.  But I have a...  Comedy and chess.  I have a couple of Kasparov anecdotes I'll share later.  Jim, what's going on?  Jim calling from Seattle.  Hey.  What's up, Jim?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Great to see you guys back on in Seattle.  But how do you know? 
[00:36:30]  The 16th, I think.  How do you know without saying anything too specific?  Well, the guy just talked about it.  He was on the same station right now.  Oh, he did?  Yeah.  Oh, they're already promoting it?  Yeah.  What did they say?  They just said, if you guys like our show and whatever, Don and Mike and everything,  then you'll like you guys.  Cool.  All right.  Because you guys are on the same station.  But you're after like us.  After like us on the buzz?  Yep.  The buzz in Seattle.  There you go.  If they're promoting it, I guess we can say something.  Thanks, Jim. 
[00:37:00]  Thanks.  All right, man.  Bye.  All right.  So we got Screech.  Tyson Lewis is tomorrow.  So Tyson might be stopping by today.  Really?  Who booked?  Oh.  Oh.  What?  I thought he was.  He's always by.  Of course he is.  Yeah, no, I understand.  Videotaping yourself having sex, Anthony.  We've got to talk about that a little bit today.  Jim Gaffigan in studio.  He's hilarious.  We've got to talk about the MTV Movie Awards.  Kreskin Phoner at 415. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, thank God.  We're going to get Kreskin on the phone to talk about that UFO sighting in the Nevada desert.  The Nevada desert.  Where's that email that I got that was hilarious?  What was it?  It was a bust.  Was it?  It was a bust.  Where did you read about it?  I heard about it on Art Bell.  I listen to Art Bell.  Yeah.  He's a kooky guy.  I love Art Bell.  He's a UFO man.  Yeah.  You want to explain the UFO thing real fast in case?  Well, people, I don't know, don't listen as much as they should be.  But Kreskin predicted that there would be the biggest UFO sighting, how he put it, of the 
[00:38:00]  century.  But considering it's only a couple of years into the century, I think he meant the entire  20th century.  Bin Laden.  Bin Laden.  Bin Laden, as his glasses fly off and his hair gets all tousled.  He said that there was going to be this huge UFO sighting in the Nevada desert.  He pinpointed the time and date and told people to go out there.  And if this isn't the biggest UFO sighting in history, he would donate $50,000 to a charity. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Well, it happened last night, didn't it?  We got the press release in front of us.  The press release is for immediate release.  It's like a big important thing.  And it's all written by him.  And he's got Las Vegas, June 7th.  Like, it's a big important thing with a big headline.  Go ahead.  Read it real fast.  And what began as a demonstration of the powers of mass psychological suggestion, world-renowned 
[00:39:00]  mentalist, the amazing Kreskin UFO prediction came true in front of thousands of viewers.  Kreskin intended to exhibit the ramifications of the power of suggestion could have if used  by terrorists or enemies of the free world.  However, in a stunning turn of events, there was an actual UFO sighting that was broadcast  live by NBC Las Vegas news crews.  It was not.  It was a bust.  No, they saw flares.  Hold on.  I got an email from someone that was there.  Continue with the press release.  It's not true.  Rick just circled the first paragraph, but the second paragraph is priceless. 
[00:39:30]  I guess this is a Kreskin quote.  My original intention was to demonstrate a scenario where an enemy who may possess the  same skill and similar abilities to yours truly would create a mass happening on even  a larger scale and over a much greater territorial area, stated Kreskin.  Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that the prediction would come true and be seen  by thousands of people watching the evening news. 
[00:40:00]  So he didn't even believe in his own prediction.  No, he said he was just saying this, so he'd get people out there and through, I guess, the power  of suggestion, they would see something.  Right.  But then it actually came true.  Then somebody saw something.  But he didn't even believe in his own prediction that he predicted on this very show.  What a creep.  And thank God Kreskin is there to help us out with the terrorism thing.  Yeah.  Pin Laden.  What a...  It was flares.  All right.  Well, here's an email from Sean. 
[00:40:30]  And the subject is, warning, warning, Kreskin is a S-head.  Is that the headline from his immediate release?  It's good to be back to the humor on this goddamn show.  Kreskin is an a-hole.  He sucks our energy.  What he did was tell the thousand people that showed that they would see a UFO.  Then an airplane flew over, and about 15 retards believed that they saw something.  And Kreskin said, show's over.  Go home.  What a dick. 
[00:41:00]  It was the largest UFO sighting of the century.  He got 15 people to believe they saw a UFO.  I heard four different planes.  People saw four different planes.  And then there was a point where there was like four flares.  There was no UFO sighting.  It was a bust.  Ugh.  Not only that, if you've ever been out in the desert,  out west,  the sky is amazing.  And if you stand there for any length of time,  five minutes,  you're going to see things in the sky.  You're going to see... 
[00:41:30]  Shooting stars.  Shooting stars by the hundreds.  You're going to see satellites  that are orbiting our planet  in the right place at the right time.  And it just so happened  the space station that they're building  was over that location at that time.  So I hope you...  I guess he was banking on that.  The shuttle had just launched  and is docking with that space station.  So that was generally in the same area.  Can you see it with the naked eye or no?  Yeah, you see something moving.  You see a reflection.  Oh, yeah.  Wow. 
[00:42:00]  So Kreskin like had all of his eggs  in one basket here with this one.  If I may use that term wrongly.  Well, Kreskin's calling in  in about a half hour, Anthony.  Is he?  Yeah.  So we'll get him on the air  to talk about this.  Is he able to predict the fact  that we're going to make him  look like a buffoon yet again?  Has he predicted that?  He's not going to have much time for us.  I think the press is...  Hot on his heels.  He always gets off the phone so quickly.  Whenever he comes in here to do something,  he runs in, does it, and goes, 
[00:42:30]  I've got to go.  The press is waiting.  I'm going to have to talk to the press.  Do you know in 33 years,  I've never seen him on the news.  No.  Ever.  Never.  For immediate release.  The best is when...  I know he said this the last time he called,  but he shows up.  He's got his TV makeup on.  And I are so embarrassed.  We're like, oh, God.  He goes, well, I'm getting ready  for all the interviews I've got to do  after I do this Penn Lawton thing.  So we have Steve from foundrymusic.com  with the video camera  follow Kreskin out to the courtyard, Anthony,  where I guess he was going to have 
[00:43:00]  this big, huge press conference.  They were gathering as he was doing  this thing on our show.  Steve runs out with Kreskin,  and Kreskin runs out to an empty,  effing courtyard.  Steve said he was so embarrassed  and just wanted to crawl and hide.  And Kreskin did the famous Dr. Bellows thing  with the, you know...  Well, but I thought a second ago  at Major Nelson, there was...  But they're over...  Maybe they're...  Yeah.  Peter Brady had more people 
[00:43:30]  at his surprise party  than Kreskin had  at his press conference.  All right.  Well, if you go to Kreskin.com,  he's got a bunch of press clippings  for when he was in the news.  Now, as I click on them,  all I am seeing is  ancient news clippings.  Where are the dates in this?  George Reeves?  This is...  Look, there's a picture of Superman  and Lois Lane. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Critic's choice.  He's got...  I guess...  Oh, the amazing Kreskin's  going to be on NBC.  And then they have a bunch of shows  that have been off the air for years.  He's got his TV guide clippings  in this.  There's nothing recent  in this at all.  Oh, there's a picture of George Reeves  and did Kreskin sell him the pistol?  All right.  Well, why don't we step aside and...  He's amazing.  And we'll continue.  Welcome to the bottomless

[00:55:30]  p.o.d. boom  they're playing the river rave sunday in boston  we're bringing the party to boston right after tonight's show  we'll be there all weekend and then broadcasting live at wbcn  the day after the River Rae.  It's going to be a lot of fun this weekend.  Oh, yeah.  Can't wait to see some old faces, some new faces.  Yeah.  I just hope I don't get choked out again this year.  Oh, that was last year, too?  Holy, yeah.  That was, uh, what the hell was his name? 
[00:56:00]  Stevie Richards.  Stevie Richards.  Choked you out.  I, uh, I was flung off his back like a fly.  That was a bad scene.  That sucked bad.  Not fun.  Not at all.  Couple phone numbers.  Oh, go ahead.  And then you get made fun of by the other wrestlers because, uh, they all think Stevie Richards  is a pussy.  Yeah.  And you're the guy that got choked out by him.  By the way, Anthony said that, Stevie.  Oh, I don't care.  He is a pussy. 
[00:56:30]  Let him come here and kick my ass.  I'll show him.  There's going to be a lot of wrestlers at the River Rafe Sunday, Anthony.  What has Stevie Richards done lately?  Anything?  Yeah, they, uh, yeah, they reinvented him.  Did they?  Yeah.  Doing something a little different for the WWE.  And Shawn Michaels has returned.  Oh, he has?  Yeah.  Not wrestling.  Yep.  Really?  Yep.  Joined the NWO.  I thought he had that bad leg.  It was a bad back.  Not a bad back.  Whatever.  I know who I, uh, who gave him the bad back? 
[00:57:00]  I think it was Tyson.  Really?  Remember Tyson was part of, uh, a wrestling family will help us out, but Tyson was part  of one of those WrestleManias?  Yeah.  And he came in and, uh, gave, uh, Shawn Michaels one of those fake hits or something?  Oh, that's right.  But I think that was the thing that, uh, messed up Shawn Michaels.  I think it was like four years ago now.  I forgot he was part of that.  Someone will correct me.  I'm, I'm not positive, but I think that's how it went down.  Because I forgot that he was part of WrestleMania.  Tyson?  Yeah.  A few years ago?  Oof.  Uh, a couple phone numbers in New York and the surrounding areas of New York. 
[00:57:30]  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else?  866-277-4.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Uh, breaking news, Anthony.  Yeah.  Jennifer Lopez splits with husband number two.  That was her second husband?  Yeah, that was her.  Yeah, oh yeah, she tossed the first one aside as soon as she got famous.  Really?  She did that thing.  Yeah.  A lot of the celebrities do that thing.  Yes.  Oops.  Ah. 
[00:58:00]  Okay.  Ah.  They must have their reason.  Yeah.  Yeah, I bet they do.  I bet they all do.  Wow.  Insert foot.  But, uh, she has, uh, yeah, she has split with Chris, uh, Judd.  They have separated, Anthony.  How long have they been, uh, been together?  Not, uh, like a year?  Less than a year.  Less than a year?  Dancer husband? 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Chris Judd, uh, she, she blew off Puffy for this guy.  She's going back with Puffy, I'm telling you right now.  Do you think?  Without a doubt.  I don't know.  I think he's writing songs about her.  A little too gangster for her image.  Nah, she's going to go back with him.  You watch.  I think it hurt her image to have the Puffster there with his gats and whatnot.  We saw that, uh, what was it, E-Tro, True Hollywood Story?  Me and Ben were watching something in the office and had Puffy and just how he's like,  yeah, all I drink is the Chrissy. 
[00:59:00]  All I drink is the Chrissy, man.  And the people at the bars are talking about how he, he'll, they'll bring four buckets  of Cristal at a time.  He'll go through $15,000, $20,000 worth of Cristal in one night, just hanging out with  his boys.  With his boys.  Yeah, this, this here's all on Biggie.  Everything's on Biggie.  And all I kept thinking is seeing poor MC Hammer on those goddamn car insurance commercials.  Oh, did you see that?  Did you see that? 
[00:59:30]  I saw that.  Did you see the one with Tiny Hammer, where Little Miniature Hammer is talking to the two  construction workers on the job site about insurance?  And then, uh, at the end of it, they go, hey, hey, but what are you doing in the toolbox?  He goes, hey, I'm the Hammer.  Oh, boy.  My jaw hit the floor.  I'm like, what?  I saw that car insurance commercial.  Is that, is that a national commercial or is it just local?  I could not even tell you.  It looks like it's a local commercial.  It looks like a little local commercial.  Well, of course, you don't recognize it's Hammer. 
[01:00:00]  By the end of it, you're like, oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Hammer.  There's the same guy that had that palatial mansion that he couldn't pay for and all his  posse.  He was buying helicopters for the Oakland Police Department.  How do you blow all that money, man?  What's wrong with people?  You know what it is?  It's your peeps.  This has happened to so many people, usually boxers, but a lot of, uh, a lot of sports  figures, rap stars.  For some reason, they take care of all their peeps around them. 
[01:00:30]  People in the community feel that if they make it, they have to, uh, bring everybody they've  ever known ever in their life along for the ride.  And these people are, I mean, a lot of scumbags that just fleece them.  They sit there and fleece them with the booze and the dope and the chicks and the cars.  What do you need 50 cars for?  You see all the cars Hammer had?  The guy had all kinds.  This here's my Rolls Royce.  What do you need that for? 
[01:01:00]  50 cars.  And how much does he drive each car?  He does it.  He collects them.  Just to show off, right?  Yeah.  And then they got all taken by the bank because he was paying for everything.  He had an entourage.  I need one car.  That's it.  You just need a car.  Give me a nice car.  Maybe two if you're really famous.  No.  I need one car.  I'd like to have two.  Why?  Because I have my Saturn, which is my sensible Jimmy Norton car.  Right.  And I'd like to have another one that a girl gets in and goes, wow, this is...  Something a little nice. 
[01:01:30]  You make a lot of...  Something with a little more headroom.  Lexus, exactly.  Something a little nice, right?  A leathery Lexus.  Dude, I was in Patrice's car last night.  Where the F is he pimping?  Let me tell you something about what that mask did.  He bought it with 100,000 miles on it.  Patrice has this Cadillac in.  Is it the sky blue one from 48 Hours?  Nice.  He has got to be a pimp when he's not doing his comedy.  He's a big man, as you all know, after yesterday's show.  So, we're at the garage getting his car, and the little garage... 
[01:02:00]  You know, the garage guy comes driving his car up, like they do.  You could barely see the guy's head.  He was sitting on the floorboard.  Oh, Patrice is a big guy.  The seat was so low and so far back, the guy was like this, stretched all the way out,  trying to get Patrice's car.  It's a great car, but it would be nicer if he had bought it without 100,000 miles on it.  100,000 miles?  100,000.  What year?  Is it a new or an old, like, classic Caddy?  Not that old.  That's fierce.  Yeah.  I mean, it's in good shape, but 100,000 miles. 
[01:02:30]  Well, Voss did the same thing with his Mercedes.  All I hang out with is used car buying asses.  I have any friends with dignity or class.  So, getting back to the cars and stuff.  Oh, yeah.  And Hammer.  Right.  With his 50 cars.  He had that huge mansion.  And then, eventually, when you watch the behind the music, it's great, because he goes, you  know, and then I just started getting these tax bills and bills for my entourage, and my  accountant said, you just don't have any money left. 
[01:03:00]  He had made a fortune.  30 million, right?  The Pepsi endorsements.  Yeah.  30 million.  A hell of a lot more than that.  He went through millions, more millions than you can imagine, and just peed it all away,  as they say, on an entourage and all the peeps.  So, that's what happens a lot of times with these guys.  Boxers, the same thing.  How many boxers just went broke?  They're saying Tyson doesn't have much money left.  Well, Don King, scumbag. 
[01:03:30]  That guy's a prime example.  He's a prime example of just attaching himself like a leech to the guy that's doing the work  in the ring, and then just soaking him.  And then, once they're done, he throws him away.  The entourage leaves.  They're satisfied.  They go on to the next guy, and he's left broke.  Do you need an entourage?  For some reason, in the community, you need an entourage.  We have an entourage.  You see Puppy's entourage?  We have an entourage.  We have an entourage?  Of mental patients that follow us around. 
[01:04:00]  Well, yeah.  You're not paying for them.  Oh, you don't think so, do you?  You know, cars and paying their rent.  Let me show you some bills.  All right.  Puppy, though, he has an entourage.  And you know something?  You've got to make sure that when you're done, when you're finally done, and everything's  over with, you have a little something left to go off somewhere and do something with.  I think the mistake...  Take care of yourself.  I think the mistake a lot of these guys make is they just assume they're going to be huge  forever.  Right.  Yeah.  Especially these music guys. 
[01:04:30]  I mean, your shelf life in music, it can't be more than two albums.  Very short.  In most cases.  Most cases, it's one album.  But they live like they're going to be Zeppelin or something, you know?  And for the rest of their lives, they're going to be able to cash in on what they're  doing.  Uh-uh.  Don't work that way.  Puppy's smart, though.  He's not stupid.  A lot of these guys are dumb.  How do you know?  He just seems like he's really a bright...  Didn't Hammer look smart at the time?  No.  Like, he was a business guy?  What?  He's getting Pepsi endorsements?  The guy's richer than rich.  He looked like the type of guy that, if it all went away, he'd be fine for the rest  of his life.  It looks to me like Puffy spending 20 grand a night on Cristal is the kind of guy that, 
[01:05:00]  you know, when it's all said and done and over with, what do you do?  20 grand a night on Boaz.  And then they try to diversify, what, he's got a clothing line and stuff like that.  Hammer had them pants.  That's right.  He had some Hammer wear.  He had the genie pants.  He had those big genie pants.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Hey, Mike.  Boss bought at least one pair.  He sure did.  Mike, what's going on?  My two favorite crackers. 
[01:05:30]  What's going on, Al?  Let's get the black man perspective on this one.  Now, look here.  Really?  Leave him alone.  He like Jesus to us.  We got a pair of big pants in the closet we pray to every night before we go to bed.  Religious Hammer.  They all turn to God, too.  When everyone else abandons them, Jesus is there, man.  Yo, I saw him on TV and rapping with a gospel rap.  I was sitting there like, this brother has fallen off, hasn't he?  No one is fine and dandy and turns to Christ, man.  It's all the guys that, like, just get left behind. 
[01:06:00]  The footprints in the sand.  At my lowest point, you left me alone.  I saw one set of footprints.  That is when I carried you, my son.  Listen, the whole thing with the entourage perspective, you go back to the hood, you  see your boy sitting on the street corner, you ain't got no money.  Yo, man, come with me.  You know what I mean?  You want to help out the brothers.  But then, like...  I don't know if it's noble or stupid, though.  It seems like a nice Robin Hood kind of thing to do.  So, but, when it's all said and done, these guys just go off and leave, and they probably 
[01:06:30]  don't even put Hammer up for the night when he needs a place to sleep.  Hammer would go to the hood, and somebody would be like, yo, Hammer, my man just got  out of jail, and Hammer would give him a job.  You know, that's how he works.  That's how he works.  Okay, that's another thing Hammer spent a lot of his money on.  He did.  He went back.  He got a lot of people to work for him.  Where he's putting everyone on the payroll, to where when he would do a show, there would  be almost a thousand of his employees working the thing.  And it would come out of Hammer's pocket.  What were they doing for Hammer? 
[01:07:00]  They were just standing there.  Just standing around, hey, carry that pack case from here to there.  Oh, but the thing was, you couldn't sleep with the other groups, like the girls, the  girl dances.  You couldn't sleep with the other groups on the road, and that's how they would send  girls home.  The guy from Jodeci was Will, and they'd be like, yo, why should we get shorty tonight?  And they had to send her home, because she slept with Jodeci.  It sounded like he was having fun, I'll tell you that.  Hey, hey, hey, as long as it ain't me.  I'm just trying to live my life, you know what I mean?  Well, you guys are better than that best of that precedes you, I must say. 
[01:07:30]  Thank you, my friend.  Love your happiness, people.  All right, peace.  Hammer, yeah, noted for having the largest entourage.  Needed a real jet.  A whole jet?  Not like a little Learjet or something like that.  A commercial airliner that he used to carry his people around it.  How do you expect to keep that kind of cash flow going?  I wonder if any of those people are helping out Hammer now that he's effed.  No, you know who's helping out Hammer?  You've got to think some of those people that were in his entourage ended up doing okay  for themselves after the Hammer thing, and I'm wondering if some of these people are kicking 
[01:08:00]  back to Hammer.  Jesus Christ is helping him out.  And the guy that gave us such hits is too legit to quit.  It's a sin that he is no longer relevant.  Isn't that LL cool, Jay?  No, that was Hammer.  That was Hammer.  I don't know.  I've never listened to Hammer.  Jay, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I was just down in Philly, and it was on down there.  And he was in a mailbox, shrunk and Hammer like the construction one.  It was great, man. 
[01:08:30]  And he gets all mad when she doesn't close the box.  He's like, ahem.  And then she goes, ooh, sorry.  And he starts laughing.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm the Hammer.  That's Hammer's gag now.  New house.  He's the little Hammer, and he lives in a mailbox.  It was great.  And he pops out of construction where his toolbox is.  Because I'm the Hammer, baby.  Does that mean that Brian Cox is going to someday do Fruit of the Wind commercials?  Bunching out.  Let's go to Rich.  He used to work at the garden.  Rich, what's going on? 
[01:09:00]  Yo, guys.  Well, what would you rather have, boxing stories or rock concert stories or rap stories?  Just give us a good story.  Because these guys, like, the hangers-on, like, I used to see Mitch Bloodgreen, Jake LaMotta,  all those guys.  And even lower lives, some guy, Mr. D, he had this huge medallion, D, show up, like, at all the shows.  And then, oh, and then your favorite, who's the big mouth?  Sharpton.  Yeah.  You'd eat hot dogs, suck them down.  Like, I used to see these guys just come in and all hang around, you know, trying to mooch money, do whatever. 
[01:09:30]  And they were nobodies.  But somehow, they used to get on the ropes, you know, pull them in through.  I don't know.  You've got to kind of assess how you are in a situation and see how big your entourage is.  And maybe whittle it down a little if you're an accountant saying,  Hey, Earl, any insight on MC Hammer?  He was spending up to, when he was on tour, he's got a hammer in his throat.  Hey, I'm the hammer.  Look, I'm little hammer in Earl's mouth.  When he was on tour, he was spending $250,000 to $400,000 a week. 
[01:10:00]  A week?  Just on the entourage.  How do you keep that up?  You don't.  You go broke.  Yeah, over 200 employees.  That's got to be some memory he's got as he's filming the tiny hammer in the mailbox.  To do what?  Commercial.  They did nothing.  Some were dancers.  Some were security.  Some were hangers-on.  They were all hangers-on.  Yeah.  He taught the shows.  He would have, like, over 100 people on stage dancing.  Puffy's going that way, man.  You think he spends too much money.  He's got too many people. 
[01:10:30]  You see that party that he threw?  That giant party?  How much does that cost?  And that's all him.  What, in the Hamptons?  Oh, yeah.  That's got to be a $1,200 to $1,500 party.  You think that?  I think so.  That much?  The hors d'oeuvres, the chips, the soda pop.  That's a lot of cake.  Chris knows what the Hammer thing's all about.  Chris.  Yeah, what's up, ONA?  Hey, man.  Hammer had the people on payroll 24-7.  That was his problem.  What do you mean?  They were on payroll 24-7. 
[01:11:00]  They got paid around the clock, no matter what.  Jesus.  In reference to him finding Jesus now, he was a preacher before he was a rapper.  Yeah, but you know something?  It's easy to be the preacher and then just kind of tuck away Jesus for a while.  You know what?  When you got the cash flowing in, you got the chicks and everything.  I think Hammer needed a Jew in his life.  But he's like Mason Betta.  You don't see Mace rapping no more.  He's a preacher.  How much cash is he making?  See, some of you black dudes, man, you need all black people around you.  Yeah.  You got to be a little smarter. 
[01:11:30]  If you're making that much money, you need one Jew around.  He'll make sure you got some money left off.  I know a lot of Jewish people.  I went to Oneonta College.  Trust me.  Jewish people kick ass.  Some of you black people, you get it in your mind, though.  Everyone around you has to be black.  Your manager has to be black.  Your girlfriend has to be black.  Your accountant has to be black.  Like black girl.  Where'd everybody go?  All that's left is Jesus Christ.  Smiles so I could see it.  All right, Chris.  All right.  How much was Hammer making a week to spend $400,000 on his stupid group? 
[01:12:00]  He grossed like $40 million one year.  And then the next one.  One year.  Oops.  And then the government took 40% of that.  Of course.  The house cost $10.  Scumbags.  And then the tour cost like almost $400,000 a week.  And it lasted two years.  And I was like, okay, I'll carry the five, one, zero.  His brother was his accountant.  His brother?  You mean brother?  His brother was like his manager.  By that, you mean brother?  And was he qualified for the job?  Absolutely not. 
[01:12:30]  He was just trying to help out his brother.  $40 million one year.  What's up?  You broke.  I figured it out.  I got you a commercial.  You stand in the mailbox, see?  You're making it.  You're on the comeback trail, brother.  You're on the little toolbox.  And then you go, I'm the hammer.  Get it?  Chris, what's going on?  Ain't funny if you say screwdriver.  What?  I was reading at Sports Illustrated a couple weeks ago.  They had an article about the Posse's, they call them. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Shaquille O'Neal has a guy on payroll.  After the game, he'll go out, start the truck, and put on some loud rap music.  So when he gets in the car, the music's already playing.  And it's all warmed up and ready to go?  Yeah.  Guy's on a payroll for that.  You don't even need to warm up a car if you live in L.A.  Yeah, but he wants, the important part is to have the music playing.  So it's cool when he gets in the car, people are around, you know.  I mean, just reach over and turn it on.  I guess not.  Do you need to pay that guy?  He's the jack daddy.  Running up a court for an hour, how lazy a guy can you be? 
[01:13:30]  You're an athlete.  Just lean over and hit on, stupid.  The athletes, at least, they kind of get like pensions and whatnot.  You know what I mean?  Like, they kind of get hooked up by NFL or basketball, whatever.  They usually pay him after they retire.  So they have something.  Like the O.J.  Goddamn O.J.  That son of a bitch is living large because of his NFL pension,  which they can't take money out of to give to the parents of the people he killed. 
[01:14:00]  So he's set.  You know, but rock stars like that or rap stars, they don't care.  They're rich for a very limited time, and they spend all their money.  Hey, guys.  Used to be a word for it.  Clean up.  Enrich.  You ever hear that?  Enrich.  You're acting like you're Enrich.  Right.  I never heard of that one.  Oh, you never heard of that one?  The Italians use it all the time.  They did.  Sean.  Hey, guys.  Towards the end, when Hammer's career was circling the drain,  he tried to sell his house, but the Indians forgot that he built it on the outside of a ghetto. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, you know what?  Who's going to buy that thing?  You don't ever build a mansion in the ghetto.  You build a shack in the wealthy neighborhood.  You guys suck.  Is that what he did?  Yes, he did.  That's right.  Because once again, I want to be with my peep.  Well, once again, going back to that theory, it's what the mentality of some of these black  people, when they get rich and famous, it's like, everything has to be black, so I got  to get back to my community, so I'm going to build my big-ass mansion in the middle of  the ghetto. 
[01:15:00]  You can't sell that.  It doesn't go up in value.  Yeah, what do you think?  The next rap guy's going to make it rich and buy it?  You know Thurston Howell and his wife ain't coming, and this is wonderful, Lovie.  What a great house.  You go and you get your brother to be your accountant.  The natives are restless, Lovie.  I hear drums.  Where was his mansion?  Was it in Compton?  It was Oakland.  It was like over a hill.  Yeah.  Looking at his old neighborhood.  And that's something.  I remember that.  It was right on the outskirts.  It's like he kind of committed back to his hood, but barely. 
[01:15:30]  But just on the outskirts.  And he made sure he was on a big-ass hill so he could take a look at everybody, make  sure they're not coming up that hill for him.  He had the high ground.  He sure did.  And then he winds up buying a bunch of helicopters for the Oakland police, which pissed off a  lot of the brothers in the community, going, you know, are you one of the brothers or  are you one of them?  You're giving them helicopters.  How much are you making that you can pay for helicopters to give them away?  Oh, poor guy. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  I want to move on, but people keep coming up with some good stuff here.  Dave.  Yeah.  Have you ever seen a VH1 behind the music on this guy?  It's classic.  Oh, it's the best.  That's what we got most of our energy.  He's got like 12 fountains.  It looks like F and C World every time you turn around.  Fountains.  Yeah.  He was big on the fountains.  All right.  Wait a little.  12 of them.  And yeah, Mike's bringing up the Hammer Saturday morning cartoon.  Remember Hammer?  Did he have magic powers?  He did.  He spun around with his pants and it made like a glittery effect and he was able to do stuff. 
[01:16:30]  Awful.  What was the premise of that?  Hammer Man.  That's so.  Hammer Man.  How long did that last?  Hammer Man.  It was horrible.  That's how you keep your credibility up in the hole.  Aw, yeah.  And when he came out on one of the award shows with the Diet Pepsi or whatever it was in his hand.  With his entourage.  Yeah.  And then he started drinking it and it's like, oh boy.  I think the Hammer sold out.  And then he lost the cred with his peeps.  And that was it.  And he ran out of cheddar.  He would spin around and his little pants would give off fairy dust. 
[01:17:00]  There was something that happened.  I'm trying to find his cartoon show.  What was it called?  Hammer Man?  Hammer Man.  There it is.  So horrible.  Hammer Man.  Let's see.  God, there's no.  91 to 92.  One of those childhood memories.  The millisecond I saw an episode of Hammer Man on video.  He bought it.  It doesn't really have a thing on it though.  About his powers. 
[01:17:30]  I want to know what his powers were.  Well, we'll find out.  Why don't we break?  Of course we will.  Made money disappear.  Just had a problem.  He threw money at it.  Dumb ass.  We have Screech outside the studio.  Dustin Diamond, I know.  And also, we've got to get Kreskin on the phone.  Oh, great.  It's time to get Kreskin on the phone.  About that UFO thing.

We've all seen these beers that have developed the cute little custom of adding a lemon or a lime before you can drink them.  Is it because these beers are a little deficient in the flavor department?  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[01:21:30]  When it said beer on the label, I actually thought it would taste like, I don't know, beer?  Of course, there's always Amstel Light, which has the perfect proportions of barley, hops, and yeast.  Did you notice I left out fruit?  Now, I have nothing against the hard-working lemon and lime producers of the world,  but when I want a beer, I'm not looking for some bizarro mango kiwi surprise.  I want something that tastes like beer, like Amstel Light.  They don't need to pull some cover-up of Watergate proportions to distract you from its taste. 
[01:22:00]  Amstel Light tastes good because it's from Amsterdam, and it's made by people who have beer in their blood.  So next time you're ordering a beer, tell them to skip the fruit cocktail and give you an Amstel Light.  Always satisfying, never watered down.  Amstel Light, the beer drinker's light beer.  Imported by Amstel USA, White Plains, New York.  Hi, I'm calling about the car you have for sale.  Can I come by and see it on my way to work around 5 a.m.?

[01:28:30]  This is Opie and Anthony.  94 WISP.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Creskin's on the line, Anthony.  Anthony, the amazing Creskin.  We've got to get a UFO update from Creskin.  Yes.  I'm curious to see what happened here. 
[01:29:00]  Ah, there we go.  It took forever.  Jesus.  They had to pick Creskin up in the other room, so he couldn't hear us while he was on hold.  What a buffoon.  It seems yesterday was the big day, or last night, that Creskin's prediction that the largest UFO sighting in like a century would happen last night.  Creskin put up $50,000 cash to go to a charity of his choice if, in fact, this did not happen. 
[01:29:30]  Uh, he says, his press release that he put out says there was, uh, about a thousand people out there in the desert.  They saw something.  Some people say planes.  It was a flare.  I don't know what it is.  I just know I've been out in the desert out there in the, uh, out west, and you see a lot of stuff up in the night sky up there.  It's amazing.  It's beautiful.  But you're going to see things.  Your mind runs away with you a little bit.  And I'm sure that any, anyone who would be out in the desert with Creskin at that hour for this purpose is a lunatic anyway and is probably seeing things. 
[01:30:00]  So what are we going to get from Creskin today?  Well, I, I see that because it amounted to nothing.  This was nothing.  And it was supposed to be the, the biggest UFO sighting in.  He said history.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In history.  And he thought, like, the press was going to be all over this thing, and his, his, his picture splashed all over the front pages of the papers, and, you know, nothing.  Dude, for Art Bell to say it's a bust, it's a bust. 
[01:30:30]  I was listening to Art Bell last night.  Yeah, and he's a lunatic when it comes to UFOs.  They're being a genius, and they kept saying it's nothing.  It's nothing.  It's Creskin again trying to pull something that gets him in the news, and it just never works.  And how is he going to get out of this, uh, phone call?  I think he's going to say that it was a huge success.  No, I mean, how is he going to hang up?  Because we always push, push, push, push, and then he realizes that he's got to go.  Oh, he'll have more press to talk to.  You think it's going to be the press angle?  All day long, he's been doing nothing but talking to news organizations about what was seen in the night skies of Nevada. 
[01:31:00]  Okay, let's get, uh, Creskin on the line and, uh, and talk to him about his UFO prediction.  The amazing Creskin.  Creskin.  Creskin.  Okay, Anthony.  Hello, Creskin.  How are you today?  Well, I'm on Earth.  Uh, last night, I, I have to tell you, I was going to a restaurant.  They said, Creskin, is this your last meal on Earth?  Oh, yeah, they thought the UFOs were going to take you away.  Creskin, uh, you must be a little tired.  You were up, uh, last night.  Well, I haven't been to bed for two and a half days, but it's because of something that happened that, uh, nobody anticipated. 
[01:31:30]  Um, we went out, you know, by Monday I said it would happen Thursday between about quarter of ten and midnight.  Yes, you did.  Now, was this something that you received, that you knew this was going to happen?  Nope.  A feeling?  Nope.  The bottom line was, I had a statement to make, uh, to the public about, uh, a form of, uh, warfare that we haven't anticipated, psychological warfare.  Creskin warfare, they're going to call it.  Oh, no.  It's a terror, a form of terror, could be used in a form of terrorism, and what I basically plan to do, plan to do. 
[01:32:00]  Never thinking this would backfire, I plan to gather, uh, groups of people and have them hallucinate on the desert, something that wasn't there, that apparently was UFOs.  He's passing around peyote buttons out in the desert.  Yeah, well, no.  Oh, peyote.  No, no.  You hallucinate in the desert.  Hey, wait.  Creskin, better known as Ecstasy Dad.  Yes, yes.  No, no, this is a tourist suggestion.  Creskin Morrison. 
[01:32:30]  Right.  Could you make Cameron not, like, hallucinate and think he's not broke?  Yeah, so 41 people ended up, uh.  How many?  Some people crying violently because of sighting, the sighting in the sky.  How many joined you in the desert this night?  Oh, about 2,000.  2,000.  2,000.  We were near the end of it, so nine college students ran out of sight, and we couldn't find them for until about midnight because they had seen a glowing, um, green, uh, two glowing green objects going across the sky.  It could have been the lenses of your glasses, Creskin. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, that could.  But, well, I went inside because the, uh, some of the press wanted to interview me away from the crowd.  Sure, of course.  Of course.  Crowd dispersed.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Where did the press, uh, interview you?  Well, the press was outside, but at one point they needed to ask in depth how I created this phenomena.  Right.  Well, we went indoors, and suddenly pandemonium broke loose.  Pandemonium.  And we, in the casino, and some of the crew came in and said, they're packing, they're packing their equipment, 75 different, uh, member, you know, members of broadcast people and what have you. 
[01:33:30]  Right, sure.  Glanced up.  75.  And, uh, yeah, one of the 75 or so said, my God, what's happening?  He created, uh, hallucinations of two, uh, green objects.  Look at the sky.  And there in the sky.  Yeah.  Were two green objects.  Fortunately, guys, the NBC, uh, fellow, his name is, uh, Steve Krupe of NBC here in Vegas had his camera on.  He calls the 11 o'clock news already on the air. 
[01:34:00]  They stopped the news.  Oh, they stopped the news.  And broadcast live, for the first time in history, ending up in thousands of people seeing a UFO sighting live.  People ran out in the streets.  And that's what you said, because you said the biggest, uh, sighting.  Yeah, but, but guys, Yopi and Anthony, I never expected it to happen this way.  Because you were lying.  Oh, Jesus.  Prescott, my, my friend lives in Vegas, and I talked to him, and he said that there was no stoppage and no live news coverage.  No? 
[01:34:30]  Yes, there was.  Tell him to look, tell him to look in the news, first of all, NBC News last night, and it was in, it was on NBC News this morning, three different times, and I just received a call.  What, what, what, what city, uh, the Nevada NBC affiliate?  The Nevada NBC affiliate, the gentleman's name is.  All right, well, we're on in Nevada.  I want to, uh, some people call.  All right, all right, the gentleman's, and so in case, just in case you want.  Hey, Jim is saying, uh, he called, he's calling from Vegas.  He's saying that it was only 350 people, and it was a hotel parking lot.  Stop it.  Were you in a hotel parking lot, Kreskin? 
[01:35:00]  The guy's name was Steve Groupie.  It was KVBC3NBC.  All right, and, uh.  And by the way, by the way, I just received a call from a military gentleman here.  Yes.  In Nevada, that a second sighting was also seen on the desert, uh, within about 10 minutes of midnight that last night as well, which we didn't know about.  Who called you?  Was it Private Snowball?  Well, but.  Wow.  But the important thing is, guys, who would have ever dreamt that if these guys had put the equipment away, so you would have heard stories that some of the guys saw. 
[01:35:30]  Maybe they were drinking vodka or what have you.  Yeah.  It was only flares.  My, they, they, they were doing it on Art Bell last night.  They saw four flares.  Yeah, sure.  Were there?  It was not flares.  There were not flares.  There were not flares.  Of course it was.  Well, why did, why was it shown again this morning on two different, on two different NBC news shows?  Look, they were, Art Bell was talking to someone from Area 51 last night.  Well, now, now, wait a minute, guys.  Guys, I was not in Area 51.  I know that, but I mean.  What is that music I hear in the background? 
[01:36:00]  It's the Brady Bunch UFO.  By the way, parenthetically, just before you called, you'll see it in USA Today on Tuesday or Wednesday, I was asked about the Tyson fight, and I won't go into it.  Oh, wait, can we have a prediction?  No, no, no.  Why not?  No, no, absolutely.  No, no, please.  Why?  What is going to be your next prediction?  No, I shouldn't have brought it up, but anyway.  I said, I'll be back.  I'm going to be back on the East Coast on Monday, but I never, I never expected this to happen.  Brescombe, where do you have to go now?  I have some more interviews. 
[01:36:30]  I'm going to.  Do you?  No, you don't.  Who's going to be interviewing you?  No, no, no, no.  What is, what's your idea to fight the terrorism?  Like, we do all kinds of card tricks and bore them and fall asleep and then storm their camps?  Yeah, what was this supposed to be now?  This was a new form of terrorism?  It was originally to show that if a person could, could get on the airways and, and play the cautious  generously and carefully over a number of days, they could have caused, they could have caused.  Wow, that is a lot more dangerous than planes flying into two buildings.  So, Kreskin, who is that?  No, no, it is, no, it's a different kind, it's a different kind. 
[01:37:00]  It's a different kind, right, Kreskin?  I can't even joke about planes flying into two buildings.  Yeah, I know.  I can't believe Norton said that.  Kreskin, who has interviewed you so far?  Yes, name it.  Who has interviewed me so far?  Yeah, I want to read some of those articles.  Yeah.  But Jesus, I mean, I've had 42 interviews.  I can't remember.  42.  42, can you remember one of them?  Yeah, one.  One paper, one news organization.  All right.  I've been interviewed by all of the media here in Nevada.  In Nevada.  In Nevada, yeah.  We've had a press conference earlier today. 
[01:37:30]  So, gentlemen, listen.  Name one paper.  Oh, baby.  One paper.  One paper.  One TV outlet.  One paper.  One paper.  Yeah, one paper.  There's two papers in town, guys.  Yeah.  There's two papers in town.  All right, well, name one of them.  Name one of the papers?  That interviewed you about this.  Guys, I don't even have a list of the interviews, so this isn't going on.  But we had a press conference attended by the press of TV.  All right.  Mr. Kreskin.  And we brought, some of it was broadcast live on news shows.  Yeah.  You, Mr. Kreskin, you were interviewed by 42 news agencies, and you, the great Mike cannot 
[01:38:00]  remember one?  No, no, no, no, no, no, that's not true.  Yeah.  How many?  I was interviewed by 42 different radio shows and TV people, yes.  A liar!  And you cannot remember one?  Yeah, I have amnesia.  I have amnesia.  Yeah.  Well, see.  One, just name one.  Well, you know, you're talking to me, guys, you're talking to me on, I'm on Mars right  now.  He's been awake for a while.  I'm having a different kind of meal, I don't even understand.  You're tired, right, Kreskin?  No, I'm not tired.  Kreskin, we're big fans, we want to read the interviews, that's all.  All right.  Just give us one magazine or one newspaper. 
[01:38:30]  Just have a little mule juice and tell us which one.  Which one?  Guys, I have been interviewed all the way from Canada.  Oh, okay.  All right, who interviewed you in Canada?  Say, yes.  You want me to list some of you who interviewed me?  Yes.  All right.  In Canada?  No.  What do you want to know about Canada for?  No, not the United States.  C.J.  I mean, in Canada, CFRB Radio, Jim Oakley, I could, Jesus, I can't even, we don't want  me to start throwing through the whole list of people in Canada, interview me, you want  to call these people, how are you? 
[01:39:00]  United States, how about the U.S.?  We want a paper, I want to read.  Would you leave us alone?  All right, I will send the stories on to you.  No, you'll send the stories on.  I haven't seen them yet, either.  I absolutely am a believer, Crescent.  Well, now, you've got to understand, wait a minute, the only thing you've got to understand,  this was not, I was not playing in the hands of the abduction type theories and everything  else.  I know this business of people being abducted, I mean, I think it works best if you're drinking  vodka in a swamp.  This is not what I do.  You're right.  Crescent, I'm thinking of a number between one and three. 
[01:39:30]  What's the number?  You know, I'm not that, Anthony Openey, I'm not that sharp right now.  I'm thinking of a number between zero and negative four, and that's how many interviews  were done about this.  Yeah.  All right, guys, listen, got to go on now, but I'll talk to you next week.  Wait, where are you going?  I've got to go on, I've got to go on to another interview.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, thanks, guys.  Thank you, Crescent.  Take care now.  The amazing Crescent.  There he comes.  I can't even be nice anymore.  Enough already. 
[01:40:00]  Stop it.  He is so full of crap.  I love he ended it that way.  I have another interview.  Liar!  I have another interview.  You can't even be nice anymore.  I have another.  I've done about 42 interviews.  All right?  Name one.  One.  Well, I can't remember the Crescent rule.  Man, you tell me you don't want him on the show.  I love him.  I love Crescent being on this show. 
[01:40:30]  You know what, man?  When he first came in, I was like, I'm going to be really polite and respectful because  the guy's done so many cartoons.  Yeah.  But after a while, you start, stop.  Stop.  It really annoys me.  I cannot.  He doesn't annoy me at all.  I love pushing his buttons.  Man, that whole Bin Laden thing bugged me.  Well, that was bad.  You've got to shut your face.  It really is annoying.  I can't see the video that is supposed to be up on this news website, this NBC News affiliate.  Yeah.  There's a link to some kind of video.  Yeah.  But I can't get to it. 
[01:41:00]  Well, Scott's calling from Vegas.  Very pissed off.  Scott, what's up?  Hey, man.  I rode out there last night just to see what was going on.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  It was a joke.  There might have been 150 people out there, Tom.  Crescent said 2,000.  Yeah.  What happened?  2,000.  Crescent can't count either.  All right.  Wait, Scott.  Did you see all the media gathered?  I was as close as any media I've seen.  You didn't see anyone with a pad and a pen or a camera or a video camera? 
[01:41:30]  No, man.  I've seen some tourists with some cameras.  Yeah.  But you didn't see the media there?  No, no.  No, no.  No media.  And just exactly what North said.  Didn't you say the media was all around, but then they wanted to get in-depth, so they  had to go in a room somewhere?  Maybe they just were in the room and never got out.  All right.  So what went on, Scott?  Absolutely nothing.  There was some flares, just like Norton said a few moments ago.  There was some flares that looked like cheap fireworks, maybe.  And weren't there four planes or something? 
[01:42:00]  There was four legitimate planes and four flares, I heard.  Here's what the KLAS news site is saying.  The amazing Crescent's prediction of seeing a UFO may have been true for some southern Nevadans,  but not many.  Thursday night, the famed mentalist.  Isn't that a dopey thing to be?  I'm a mentalist.  Claimed that between the hours of 9 p.m. and midnight, UFOs could have been seen near  the Silverton Hotel.  So it was like in the hotel parking lot. 
[01:42:30]  Wow.  Hundreds of onlookers showed up for the sighting, but not everyone left convinced there was  life on other planets.  I've seen many UFOs, but once you've seen one, you know you've seen it.  But there's no other way, one onlooker said.  A cuckoo.  But at least one viewer claimed to see something strange in the sky.  It was a little bitty blue thing, then came toward us and moved away again, the viewer  said.  Came down, went right back up, down and right back up.  Can I tell you guys something? 
[01:43:00]  That was his wife's head.  Exactly.  You know how obvious this is?  Those are plants that Kreskin put in the area with them.  Kreskin promised that if there was no UFO sighting, he would donate $50,000 to charity.  He'll hold a press conference Friday today to discuss his prediction and its outcome.  Well, you just heard his outcome.  I'd give him more credit if he was in a hotel parking lot and he jumped garbage cans and hit  a fried chicken stand.  Hey, fun. 
[01:43:30]  Brian.  Yeah, I think it's funny how Kreskin can see the future, but he can't see the past.  That's all good.  That's good.  How many interviews did you do?  I don't know.  I don't know.  42?  Who did you do them with?  Oh, there were so many.  Well, one.  The last one you just did.  And he can remember, this is what annoys me, he remembers the call letters for the radio  stations in Canada.  Yeah, yeah.  And he can't remember what American interviewers have interviewed him.  Oh, there were so many.  That's CRXJ, HIV, STD. 
[01:44:00]  Aaron, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  All I got to say, dude, it's more like the amazing douchebag, because I was outside all  last night getting drunk and I didn't see nothing.  Yeah.  Nothing.  And the way he was doing it was right in the flight pattern of McCarran Airport.  So there was airplanes flying over constantly.  So any kook that's out there looking is going to see an airplane and be like, oh, you know.  Yeah, wait, I think that's something.  Yeah, exactly.  What an amazing buffoon.  What an ass.  He had everybody meet at the Continental Hangar at McCarran. 
[01:44:30]  The aliens are boarding now.  Take it easy.  I'm out.  He's got the flashlight up in the window like Greg Brady.  It's a UFO.  Hey, Bobby's seeing a UFO.  Hey, Kreskin, why are we at the planetarium?  I don't mean to do this.  It's going to be big.  The newspapers are going to be big.  Oh, all the newspapers are going to pick up on this. 
[01:45:00]  It's going to be huge.  All right, Kreskin.  Hold on.  Now the Vegas callers are starting to call like crazy.  Eric, what's up?  What up, y'all?  Hey, man.  It was so funny last night.  Yeah?  They had, right after they were out there on location, just like, that was actually my  friend Aaron that called.  Anyway, they're on a location just like a mile south of the airport.  The weatherman gets on after they're done talking to everyone.  Then they had a list of like 20 identified flying objects that were going overhead like  every minute interval. 
[01:45:30]  They're like, a satellite here, a satellite here.  And the flash, it was so stupid.  It was like two little colors.  And everyone was like, what the hell is that supposed to be?  If somebody's out in the desert and sends up a flare or some kind of Roman candle, I can  picture that's what it is, you know?  Oh, look, there's lights in the sky.  If it was the flight, if you were a guy, if you guys were below a flight pattern, he  probably was one of his friends.  Yeah.  In a plane with cars.  Of stupid colored flashlights. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  Out the window or something.  Did you see the news thing, Eric?  Yeah.  And what, when Kreskin said that the news all of a sudden went, oh my God, and ran outside  and cut into live programming to show this up in the sky, what was it?  There wasn't any live programming.  It was in the middle of the newscast.  And there's nothing interesting going on in Vegas anyway, except for Kreskin's dumb ass.  What did they say on the news?  That there's a doddering old ass suckering people to the Silverton Hotel? 
[01:46:30]  And what time did it happen?  It was right about, it was a little after 11.20 maybe.  Yeah.  I mean, the newscast is still going on, we get 11 o'clock news out here and, I mean.  But they didn't break into the news and like, oh my God, move the equipment quickly.  Like, Kreskin makes it sound like, all right, I was sitting down for an interview and everyone  started yelling and screaming and the news crews grabbed their cameras, ran out, and there  was two UFOs in the air.  That's what he says. 
[01:47:00]  What do you say?  What did you see on the news?  Well, when I was sitting there watching it, I mean, I'm watching the news and all of a  sudden they're like, oh, oh, we got to go live to Kreskin's thing.  And you look up and they show a shot of the sky and there's like three little flashes and  that's it.  And they're like, okay, there's your UFO.  Everybody go home.  Oh, what a tool.  What a tool.  I was about to throw my TV out the window.  Yeah.  That's classic.  Thanks, Eric.  Mentalist.  All right, late.  Big press conference.  Mental retardedist. 
[01:47:30]  Brian.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What up?  Hey, Kreskin has many interviews as Vostell's good jokes.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Hey, thanks, guys.  Take it easy.  That's evil.  All right.  Well, there you go.  There's the Kreskin thing.  Finally.  That just...  All wrapped up.  The whole thing that time, well, you know, there's CNN footage of me predicting that  there'd be a terrorist attack.  So you shut your face.  Oh, he did say that.  That really annoys me.  It's like, stop using the terrorist attacks to somehow further your mentalist nonsense. 
[01:48:00]  I forgot.  He came in and said that.  He said that he had predicted that.  He then said he came out with a Pin Laden thing, which was just an abomination.  He's been on our show about six or seven times.  Now, in the beginning, we were buying all this crap.  Because we all grew up seeing him on Carson.  We're like, hey, he's got to be for real.  He was on Carson.  But they were magic tricks.  You were watching tricks.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  And they're like, wow, how'd he do that?  Nobody actually thought that, hey, wow, well, this guy says it's true.  It was very, how'd he do it?  Yeah.  They're tricks.  But then we started getting very suspicious.  Tricks.  Something aggravating about that. 
[01:48:30]  Stop it.  I like the guy.  Don't get me wrong.  He's a nice, he's a charismatic, fun guy.  He's great for this show, because he always ends with, oh, I've got another interview.  But no one's interviewing you.  I know.  We know all of you.  You can't remember who you talked to.  That annoys me.  Stop lying.  I don't like it.  On his homepage, he's got all the predictions for 2002.  People will be buying larger homes.  He has predicted that. 
[01:49:00]  Wow.  Wow.  Oof.  The greed of the chairman of the boards of Enron.  will cause scandal, and the government would also create a distrust for Wall Street analysts.  Wow.  This is after the fact, though.  Of course it is.  These are his predictions now.  Saddam Hussein will be the real major evil of the year 2002.  Wow.  There is.  He's really pulling these things out of left.  Yeah, there he is going off on a limb.  Oh, man. 
[01:49:30]  It's just, he's got all.  Well, John Walker, son of the wealthy family who fought in the Taliban against the Americans,  he will be tried by a military tribunal.  And no, he's not going to be.  Wow.  If Condit chooses to run for re-election, he will win.  He lost.  It's that right.  Didn't he lose?  Yes.  He lost.  Where's the big press conference about that little mix-up on the old website? 
[01:50:00]  I have another interview.  No, you don't, stupid, unless you're talking to the shady homes, rest people.  Fuck.  I was with you, too, man.  I was pulling for you.  I couldn't shady, rest homes.  I was looking at you like, come on.  I couldn't do shady homes, rest homes.  It said homes twice.  Bill Maher will no longer host Politically Incorrect.  Wow.  Well, all righty, hit that one.  You have to be really deep into psychology to have a friend at ABC. 
[01:50:30]  Stupid ass.  Okay.  There we go.  That's about it.  There's a lot of press people.  So much press with Kreskin.  Well, let's step aside.  We've got Screech, Dustin Diamond.  Yep.  And I saw Jim Gaffigan wandering around out there.  Very funny guy.  Yes.  We'll get those guys in to join the party next.  Coming soon.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show.

These days, everybody's looking to cut some calories from their diet,  but who wants that kind of sacrifice to come out of their beer?  Especially when it means sacrificing taste.  Nobody wants to take a step down in the flavor department.

A light beer will be a mild-mannered milk toast in the flavor department.  95-calorie Amstel Light will kick the butt of your taste buds  with its rich, full-bodied beer flavor.

This beer should be pumping iron at Beer Muscle Beach  with the rest of the big taste boys  and kicking sand in the face of the other light beers  and doing it while still looking buffed and ripped 
[01:53:30]  in its snug little six-pack.  And in the process of cutting calories,  you may be surprised to find yourself pumping up the taste quotient  from that bland beer in your hand  to a flavorful Amstel Light.  Somebody spot me while I go for this clean and jerk.  Always satisfying, never watered down.  Amstel Light.  The beer drinkers like beer.  Imported by Amstel USA, White Plains, New York.

Can I do that again?  Because I'm illiterate.  All right.  Hey, this is Jim Norton.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show on 94 YSP.  Ugh.  Things are going to get interesting now.  Always in it.  We got Dustin Diamond in the studio.  Jim Gaffigan in the studio.  We're finding out we're being fined by the FCC as we speak. 
[02:03:30]  I guess so.  And they're getting everything all wrong.  Breaking news.  Like Kreskin will be holding a press conference.  Goddamn Kreskin.  And of course, New York Radio Message Board getting it all wrong.  Well, that's only one of the many, many media outlets jumping on the story already.  This is ridiculous, first of all.  You want me to read a little something?  Yeah, go ahead.  FCC hits ONA with fine. 
[02:04:00]  PM drivers, Opie and Anthony, locally heard on WJFK-FM.  Guess this is coming out of Washington, this story.  Get their New York City station.  Fined by the FCC for, what, $21,000?  $21,000 for a series of indecent broadcasts, including late 2000 airings of, okay, could  you please tell me when we did this show? 
[02:04:30]  Girl giving her father oral.  When?  Was I out that day, perhaps?  Maybe I was going to the bathroom.  That was the day you were a little sick.  Was I playing foosball?  That was the Christmas show, right?  Was it?  I came in late, maybe?  I was trying to make that last goal.  I came in a minute late from break, and it had already been over.  I think you had a court date, and I figured, you know, if I'm going to do the show by myself.  You might as well have a girl giving her father oral.  Well, I'm not good at the voices. 
[02:05:00]  I figure this could be something that'll get us through that day.  You sons of bitches.  You're getting this all wrong.  Can you read that again?  That's one.  Yes, yes.  Read it again.  We're getting fined for what?  What, what, what, what?  $21.  $20,000 for a series of indecent broadcasts, including late 2000 airings of a girl giving  her father oral.  Jim, you want to be on this show today?  Comma.  It's not over yet.  A girl.  They're accusing you for R. Kelly or something.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:05:30]  A girl sticking a phone receiver in her pants.  Right.  And in early 2001, a parody song about pedophilia.  All the fines, blah, blah, blah, broadcast to Kerry before opening, Anthony started airing  on JFK.  So, uh, I, I, first of all, I don't remember the, uh, father, uh, daughter oral.  That's, see, that's one of those benchmark things that would kind of stand out in my head.  But that was one of our, uh, throwaway bits.  Was that a throwaway? 
[02:06:00]  Maybe we didn't remember it.  Not one of our benchmarks.  It was just one of those, eh, eh, whatever, we're just filling time here type of thing.  And guess what's in my pants?  Has it gotten to the point now, without even describing what is going on, that you can't  even make sound effects on the air in certain ways?  Has that where we've gotten to, as far as this goes?  And a parody song about pedophilia, in the context of a contest we were doing, the most  offensive song ever written.  That's what we were doing that day.  We had people write in offensive songs on race, sex, retardation, everything. 
[02:06:30]  Because the gimmick of the bit was the most offensive song.  Were there any street songs?  No, there were no street songs.  Which, uh, yeah, that might have, that might have, uh, covered up the pedophile songs.  Yeah.  Can't get fined for that one.  No, not at all.  Good to have you in here, by the way.  That's great to be had, you know?  We, uh, we saw you, we were, we were behind you once at Wrestlemania.  Yes.  Out in Anaheim. 
[02:07:00]  In 2000, April 2nd.  It was only, yeah, it was only one time.  Okay.  And for 2002 airing of Screech, performing oral on, jeez, man.  That's ridiculous.  Can you believe they do this?  And yeah, now it says, uh, I don't know, I'm not even going to get into the ins and outs  of this whole thing, but, I mean, it's getting ridiculous.  It's getting ridiculous.  It's radio.  It's supposed to be an open forum to some point, and now they're, they're pulling back a little 
[02:07:30]  too hard, and, uh, the repercussions are going to be a lot further than, than just this show.  You're going to see stupid stuff start happening.  Maybe there are certain people who are members of the church that want to divert attention  from what's really going on with their, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, how about that one?  Fellow, uh, parishioners.  Do you think, uh, our show, uh, is responsible for priests sucking away?  Well, if you look at who's in the FCC, oh, you guys are probably going to get fired for  this conversation.  Hey, Jim Norton, Jim Norton, don't say that, Jim Norton. 
[02:08:00]  So, there you have it.  That's breaking news.  Breaking news.  Boy, this will bump, uh, Kreskin's UFO story out of the top slot.  Whoops.  I'm sure.  The press is going to have a field day with this one.  You watch.  Yeah, yeah.  What'll this mean?  And then all the little message boards will start chatting.  It's over.  It's over, see?  No.  The backlash has begun.  Shut up.  We eat crap like this up.  Don't worry about it.  And Kreskin was stupid, too. 
[02:08:30]  I was listening to that earlier.  How ridiculous is Kreskin?  You know, I have a prediction for Kreskin myself.  Yeah.  Okay, wait, I'm getting it now.  I'm feeling that while he was doing this interview earlier, uh, old Zeb was taking care of his  old lady at home.  You know, come on, Kreskin.  Kreskin is a tool.  He is a tool.  Kreskin, fellas, Kreskin is my best friend.  Is he?  No.  Jim Gaffigan.  I remember growing up and watching him on the Tonight Show and stuff, you know, on  Johnny Carson.  You go, and here comes Kreskin. 
[02:09:00]  And Kreskin would come out and it was like, wow.  As a kid, you're like, ooh, look, he's amazing Johnny.  He's amazing Johnny Carson.  So he's got to be good.  Now he calls us up and he's 800 years old.  Wow.  He calls us up now and tells us that he's got to run real quick.  He could only be on the air for a short period of time because the press is waiting for him.  He's got to go to the next interview.  I'm just amazed he's still doing anything at all.  I mean, the amazing Randy, you know, made him a hoax way earlier with his spoon bending  and all that.  You've got to give him credit.  He is still around.  Kreskin did one of his gags on our show about a month, month and a half ago, Dustin. 
[02:09:30]  He fell down.  We thought he had a stroke live on our show.  It was great.  We didn't know what to do.  It was part of his gag, I guess, that he was overcome by the power.  The power that flows in him just got to him.  Once you do that crossing in New York Street, you know what I mean?  And just fall down and have a bus hit him.  His big, goofy glasses went flying and we just were all so uncomfortable.  You know what should happen to Kreskin on his way into a performance?  He should be murdered like Scatman Crothers in The Shining. 
[02:10:00]  Somebody should just come out with an axe.  Is anybody in the press here?  Flock.  Gay Marco wants to say hi to Dustin.  Hey.  Marco.  Oh my God, I love Saved by the Bell.  Yeah, Gay Marco.  I'm the biggest fan.  What's going on here, Marco?  I love that show.  I have to tell you, when I was a male escort, I adopted your name.  I was Dustin Diamond.  Oh no, I thought you meant Screech.  I was going to say you should go with Scratch or, you know, Sniff or something.  Oh my God, I love Saved by the Bell. 
[02:10:30]  Every Saturday morning, I would spank one out to it.  Oh.  And cut.  It was the best show.  And you know what?  The first year cast was so great.  Oh, well, great.  Yeah, thanks.  Except, and I wonder what happened to everybody until now I see your back, but what happened  to that black chick?  I don't know.  I think she's probably spanking one out somewhere right now, too.  Oh my God.  You don't keep in touch with those guys anymore?  No, I don't make it to the unemployment office that much, though.  You know what I mean?  Oh, boy.  I'm always on the road. 
[02:11:00]  Wow.  That's a little brutal.  Oh, come on.  You didn't get along with her?  Oh, yeah, sure.  But you spend 10 years with someone, you got to, you know, bust them a little bit.  Right, okay.  Anything else, Marco?  Oh, my God.  And that guy, Angel, who was in the second year, you know, the second class?  Oh, my God.  He was so hot.  Okay, now, wait a minute.  Marco, I got a question for you.  Now, how much were you charging when you were going under my alias?  $200.  Oh, good.  So I wasn't cheap.  All right.  Were you barebacking?  No.  What would you get for $200, Marco? 
[02:11:30]  Just about everything, except for, like, heavy-duty S&M.  So no one's going to watch Saved by the Bell ever again is basically what we're going to.  All right, Marco, you are.  Okay, I wanted to say hi.  Bye.  Love you.  You have nothing.  What about Elizabeth Berkley?  What was that like when you saw her in that movie?  Had you seen her nude before on the set of Saved by the Bell?  Showgirls?  Oh, come on now.  Yeah.  I mean, the first week.  Because it used to be with Hayley Mills, Good Morning, Miss Bliss.  Then it became Saved by the Bell when NBC picked it up from the NBC-Disney merger. 
[02:12:00]  They added Slater, Jesse, and Kelly.  And Elizabeth Berkley was in the next dressing room over from mine.  And we had, it was one of those, it was Sunset Gower Studios in L.A.  And it was set up to where it was two dressing rooms with a very thin dividing wall that you could,  it was so thin that you could hear through it.  It whispers, anything.  Oh.  You know, TV.  Oh.  Now, here's why.  I asked later, and I found out you could take the wall down in, like, 15 minutes.  No questions asked.  Oh, they need a bigger room.  Yeah, to make, you know, in case a big celebrity comes in, someone important, right?  I'm taking down the stock photos and paintings of, like, vases, apples, stuff like that, 
[02:12:30]  putting up my own pictures, you know, I'm going to be there for the whole season, right?  Uh-oh.  Take down the poster on the dividing wall.  There's a hole.  No sawdust.  Obviously cleanly been drilled through.  Oh, yeah.  Looking into where Elizabeth's going to be changing.  Ah.  So I got a moral dilemma now, right?  You know, do I call security and have them come plug up the hole?  There's no dilemma.  No, you look.  You don't even go through that thought process.  So you're saying I should plug up the hole, right?  Yeah.  Did you see it?  Now, I sat down for about a half hour looking at that wall.  You know what?  Pondering it.  Screw it.  Let her look.  I don't care. 
[02:13:00]  You know, give her a thrill.  Oh, I get it.  It doesn't offend me, you know?  Oh, boy.  So why they call me Screech, you know?  Welcome to the fourth dimension.  But when you saw her in the movie, you hadn't seen her naked before.  A little bit.  You had?  Yeah.  You know, I mean, I still went and sat in the front row.  I mean, I buttered my popcorn, so to speak.  Nice.  Nice.  Yeah, pretty good.  When you see something like that happen, it's like...  The movie was only missing one thing.  A story.  You know?  It didn't need one.  It was just cool that the girl from Saved by the Bell was naked. 
[02:13:30]  Because that's how everybody was saying it.  You want to go see that Saved by the Bell girl naked movie?  Yeah.  And Marco's out there right now going, when is Showboy's coming out, you know?  Oh, no.  Yeah, the same poster except the ad campaign, but the leg is hairy.  Yeah, that's right.  I don't think we'd go see that one.  Andy with the bad phone.  Hello.  What's up, Andy?  Oh, my God.  Where's he calling from?  Venus?  Where I'm calling from is way upstate.  We're way past where Saved used to live.  All right.  All right.  What's up is, I have a rumor that Dustin Diamond was Michael Diamond's little brother from the BD Boys. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Or not.  That is a very old rumor.  It is not true.  Mike Diamond, Mike D of the Beastie Boys, is not my brother.  What about Neil Diamond?  Neil Diamond?  Tell you the truth, I think he might be my dad's second cousin.  Related?  Yeah.  I'm not sure, though, because the only woman who knew all the family secrets and stuff, I never met him.  But she died and took all the secrets with her.  Saved by the Bell.  So we'll never find out that, and we'll never know who Miss Calabash was, you know? 
[02:14:30]  This is Calabash.  All right.  We've also got to say hi to Jim Gaffigan.  He's in the studio.  Jim.  You guys are ignoring me.  Huh?  No, we're not.  Not at all.  We're just going to farm.  Hey, at least Dice isn't here today.  I know.  I tell you.  Was that the last time he was in here?  Remember when Dice was in here?  Dice was here.  He kept on calling me a farmer.  Yeah.  A farmer.  The guy's a farmer, and he's got a TV show.  And he wouldn't let him talk.  It was awful.  It was so funny.  He was sitting there being nice and just trying to say a couple of things.  He's, who's the farmer you got here? 
[02:15:00]  No, it was awful.  But you don't have that distraction today.  No.  No, I'm not.  So you'll be able to just flow with your comedy.  Whatever you want to do, feel free.  You're welcome here.  He saw our prep sheet and started laughing.  There's nothing there.  There's nothing there.  We've got to go with the breaking news of our FCC fine.  Yeah.  I don't know how you follow.  And we made that up.  I don't know how you pedophilia stuff, because that's funny.  It's in the context of the most offensive song. 
[02:15:30]  I just don't know how you follow a picture of Rich Voss, you know, in his old comedy days.  Oh, my God.  By the way, for the people listening that listened yesterday, we were reviewing Rich Voss' tape from 13 years ago.  He was standing back.  The pictures are up on foundrymusic.com.  So go there.  It is now my wallpaper on my desktop.  Really?  Yeah.  There it is. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  Look at the hair.  How long was he in, Johnny?  The teeth.  The teeth.  That is a chasm.  That's a cocaine rot chasm.  Well, he had them capped.  Now they're just these huge walrus things.  But before that, look at how black.  Yeah, it's unbelievable.  In the middle.  Well, that is a just-say-no-to-drugs ad right there.  Those are the hills-have-eyes teeth.  Yeah.  He's a disgusting, awful jerk.  And the jerry curl is like...  Is it a worm on his shoulder, or is that a curl? 
[02:16:30]  It's a jerry curl.  I mean, he's got his hair all jerry curled out.  Dustin, is it true you guys went to check out rats together?  You and Voss and Norton?  Yeah, yeah.  We checked out...  I mean, it was the craziest thing.  They were saying all these rats lived in these little, you know, bushels that were, you know, fenced in.  Was that by 72nd?  Yes.  Yeah.  We're throwing down...  Right where you make that turn off of Broadway.  Make a left off like Columbus Rams today on Broadway.  Dude, I used to have to make a left turn there, and I'd pull up and look down and go, oh my God, it's a plague. 
[02:17:00]  It's a plague of rats.  It's the craziest thing, because Norton pops out, I was like, check this out.  He got some, like, Reese's Pieces stuff, right?  Yeah, feed him.  Great.  Yeah, and he throws it out, and literally, like, two or three hundred come running out.  Come on!  Yeah.  It's insane.  And where is this?  It's at 72nd?  Yeah, but they're doing...  It's right by the 72nd Street subway station.  They're building something now, though, so I probably...  I know.  I think that...  You know something?  That was a big problem.  And it said...  There were signs on there that said, don't feed the animals.  Yeah, I don't know. 
[02:17:30]  I thought they meant the homeless, you know?  Anything.  You didn't expect, like, 200 rats.  And you'd see that there was a covering of, like, ivy and this little short brush that would come up about a foot and a half high.  And you'd see it rattling.  With all the rats just moving underneath it.  And it wasn't big.  The plot of a fenced-in area wasn't any bigger than this studio.  Oh, they were under the ground.  We're not talking little, like, rats you'd see hamster-sized in the store. 
[02:18:00]  We're talking big rats.  Giant rats just overtook this area.  And that's where you went to feed them.  We would put little peanut butter things out and just sit in the car for hours.  Yeah, keep in mind, sit in the car.  You wouldn't want to be just standing there, you know what I mean?  No, frightening.  They don't really bother me.  I mean, I don't like them, but they're not going to jump on you.  You just know it's a big, diseased mess in there.  Well, so are you.  I never saw it.  I've paid big, diseased messes for oral treats.  Vapors.  I'll tell you, I had one.  This is true, man.  I had a hooker.  And I'm not going to say it was very recently.  Because I've been on dates with regular girls. 
[02:18:30]  Right.  And I was absolutely true.  I'm like, well, do you shoot dope?  Because she was really skinny.  And you've got to be careful.  And she's like, no, I don't shoot dope.  You just ask these things right out.  Yeah.  What a romantic thing.  Absolute interview.  And she's drinking out of my mule, and she's taking her fingers, and she's going like  this on the vein.  On yours?  Yeah.  Like they do on their arms.  Right.  To get the vein out, and it worked.  To get me.  Well, that isn't good.  Because then you know she's a pro.  And of course that's what that means.  With the vein tap.  With their two fingers, she was like.  I'm not hungry anymore. 
[02:19:00]  Absolutely true.  Let's go to Mr. Gaffigan.  Do you have a similar experience?  No, I don't.  Nothing like that?  Nothing like that happened to you?  Your hookers never do that?  Most of my hookers have been non-drug induced.  Really?  Non-tappers, huh?  So that's healthy then.  No tappers.  You get the healthy hookers.  Do you have a rat story?  No, I think I stepped on a rat once.  But that's, I'm like a total pussy though. 
[02:19:30]  I mean, my girlfriend and I, there was a mouse in her apartment.  You know how like the guy's supposed to like get rid of it?  I was like jumping on the couch.  I was like, you deal with it.  That's a good story.  That's the difference between me and Gaffigan.  He did Letterman and has his own TV show.  I have hooker and rat stories.  I'm a failure.  Hey, those are some good rat stories.  This is all lies I'm reading in this complaint, Opie, if I may get back to that for a minute.  Yeah, we're a little distracted here.  In a segment of the Opie and Anthony show, the show's host asks a 17-year-old girl to remove her panties. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, yeah.  And rub the telephone on and then it gives a very, very graphic description of what I'm saying.  I can't even say in this forum or we'll have another one of these.  Let me say, turn it around.  On her...  Elbow?  On her...  Oh!  Filtrum?  I'll just say on her...  Hair.  Very, very graphic.  On her...  Underarm?  Right.  For certain curlies, huh?  Right.  And it says, the show host called the game Teen Guess What's in My Pants. 
[02:20:30]  The show host gave detailed instructions regarding how to rub the telephone across the girl's  area.  No!  Wrong!  Well, you know, you should only be punished, you know, if you do that repeatedly, you know.  Do you know...  At church, you only get away with it once, right?  We never say where the girl is rubbing anything.  Right.  We made a point of that because we're knowledgeable broadcasters.  Because we're professional broadcasters.  I'm not saying you're a pedophile. 
[02:21:00]  And we're smart, all right?  We know.  Look, just because you do pedophile things does not mean you're a pedophile.  Yeah.  We don't.  I'm not saying you're a pedophile.  You're not helping us today.  I mean, you might have a lot of symptoms of a pedophile, but you're not a pedophile.  They said the same thing about Gary Glitter.  That's right.  You know?  I thought you would love that guy.  Did you hear the latest about Gary Glitter?  They want to...  He's the guy...  You know the guy from...  What the hell did he do?  Rock and Roll Part 1.  Da-na-na-na-na.  Hey!  Da-na-na-na-na. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's the guy that did that song.  That's him?  Yeah.  That's Gary Glitter, yeah.  Da-na-na-na.  Hey!  Yeah.  So he gets...  He has a problem with his computer.  Right.  You know?  A little problem with the computer.  And he brings it into the shop to have it fixed.  Right.  And they look at his hard drive, and lo and behold, there's plenty of children on his hard drive.  Very provocative poses.  You know what I mean?  Very provocative indeed. 
[02:22:00]  As a matter of fact, when I see you on those computer commercials where you look over at Derek Jeter,  screen same stuff he's probably got on his screen oh you shouldn't bring that up why he doesn't do  the commercial i've seen him already it's not what we assume to wipe out all history they replaced me  he got kicked out though it's a touchy subject is it we can't even discuss it anymore you can  discuss it he's like stalin just wipe out any history before they they went with some other  guy they did with a guy that's going to be cheaper they went with dyes no hey what are you doing on 
[02:22:30]  a computer i actually i don't know who the guy is but they went with someone else yeah they replaced  him but get it bastards oh my god this fine thing is going everywhere really so no one makes a big  deal out of all the priests that were you know i know yeah well they're kind of making a big deal  of it but i mean a little bit but you know we're just a dopey radio show that's the catholic church  and they've been doing it for years yeah i mean you know it makes it makes a news headline once 
[02:23:00]  you know after how many uh how many events many yeah they really went out on a limb and say like  if the guy's done it twice we're gonna let the police know it's like wow thanks after each direction  from the host the station broadcast the sound of the telephone rubbing across the girls  area now no what is that her elbow how is anybody to know see this is how the rules are getting a little  too tight we never said where she was rubbing the phone could have been an armpit could have been a leg 
[02:23:30]  could have been like when we say hey have you shaved lately rub the phone  oh it's a leg who knows we don't know what she was doing we honestly don't she's on the phone  could have been speakerphone could have been speakerphone unless you would have known unless  you heard like a you know something along those lines then there's lyrics from  there's lyrics from one of the songs hopey  yes anthony uh it's the let me just say uh the first word i'm horny 
[02:24:00]  oh yeah oh two round butts like all right ram what no that was said what okay look i'm gonna  have to i love the bell well that's that really lets everybody know that that's what's going on  and i'm in agreement okay hey get back to the gary glitter thing oh yeah gary glitter or you want  to continue with this we're really distracted because this thing is gary glitter brought his 
[02:24:30]  computer and had it repaired and uh they found a bunch of uh pictures of little kids and sex and  things like that so uh they arrested him and uh he got out of jail i guess and went to vietnam  which if you know anything about vietnam and thailand and those areas it's uh it's kitty disney  over there if you're a pedophile it's disneyland you just uh they're all running around the streets  like that girl with the napalm on her back from the old vietnam photo running down the street 
[02:25:00]  that well gary glitter likes stuff like that hey so uh vietnam how bad do you have to be that  vietnam's just announced they are looking for gary glitter they want to deport him  how how bad do you have to be to be deported from vietnam during the war they strap bombs to  their kids i know they want to boot him out for banging them we're really trying to change our

[02:48:30]  the weigh-in we got the producers come down and meet us and the producers come down and said that  that he had had a nose job and a chin job and he was worried about me you know because of my size  getting you know popping him in the face i weigh 198 right yeah so uh um i said look you know i'm he's  got to do hamlet the next day i gotta catch i caught a red-eye flight that night to go do stand-up  and uh so i was like uh look i'm not out to you know kill you or anything we're making the same  money who cares you know we're making our money regardless of what we want to lose so uh we go

[02:49:30]  gotta you gotta fight back no no and if you watch the first round because they stopped it in the  second i thought i was trying to get it to go to the third round i didn't think i was hitting him that  hard i mean i wanted that tv air time you know you only get three rounds so i go up there and uh and  i'm hitting his body even though he's so small and i don't know if anyone noticed that goiter on his back  he had like this big lump it did have something going on on his back it was like a cyst i didn't  want to hit it i was afraid it was gonna pop you know so i'm out there that would have been good

[02:50:30]  and you blew his eye up i saw his eye was uh full of blood they said that i broke his nose oh you did  did you i don't know i don't think so it looks straight to me but it said that on the news  news so i plan a whole career now of uh beating up the elderly the retarded you know kids yeah you  know it looked really bad because he's just some old guy you were beating up an old man okay he's 48  george foreman got in the ring at 52 i mean foreman i don't know if you compare george foreman and  short yeah but you don't compare me and tyson either i mean you know foreman is a better actor yeah

[02:53:00]  in and you know and see what happens we had a couple of guys in yesterday just sitting around oh my god  it killed for us i don't know what happened i don't know it's i'm just just woke up yeah gaffigan just woke  up i'm disappointed myself check out my website i was like all right all right we'll check it out  maybe there's something good there and we go and it's like no it's the best website  come all right and then he's thumbing through the paper he's just reading eating i i don't know wait 
[02:53:30]  you know i thought we'd hang a little yeah talk about anything anything the first hour we were here  you were talking about your pedophilia it was an fcc complaint you're addicted to pedophilia  it is not it's an fcc complaint it's an fcc complaint we brought it up and then we're moving  on moving on i just want to go back to why everyone thinks it was bad for me to to beat up uh horse  shack because he was old he knew what he was getting into no i thought that was very good as a matter of 
[02:54:00]  fact i wish i wish you would have heard him more yeah that's all i'm saying is it was entertaining  watch when you hit the ring both of you i'm like oh my god he's gonna kill this old guy i had some  showmanship in there you know i was playing for the crowd i liked uh at one point you did you went back you put  your arms down and kind of waved him in he thought it was an opportunity came running in and he got  pummeled yeah you lifted your hand up and punched him in the face i thought that was uh i thought that  was clever who cares i thought that was nice i mean it was a very highly rated television show 
[02:54:30]  this show stinks and cut to all of you we're talking about boxing yeah but it was a big thing 17 million  viewers you know and cut what does it mean when cousin rob from brooklyn says there's more humor in  the cancerous testicle is there that's actually true yeah there's there's always humor it's not  necessarily the cancerous testicle as much it is the shattered dreams and heartbroken family members  the what could have been 
[02:55:00]  ebstein's mother saying you were looking for boxing prowess you were fighting effing horse  shack and he was fighting effing screech i mean come on now you know he knew what he was getting  into you all right what do you do jim jaffigan stop reading i'm not help us  i i i don't want to be i know you're funny i don't want to interject look he you know mr diamond  here is talking oh this is bad now people are asking is voss still in town perhaps we can get rich

[02:56:00]  the audience is a pretty good gauge of what we should do next i i the audience is a good gauge  as to what we should do next i don't i don't see anything good that could come out of that what  so well i'm curious to see what the audience thinks was you know the down point of the uh of  the experience so far i mean was it the talking about the pedophilia i don't know 45 minutes the  fcc complaint i think it all went was that what happened i think it all went wrong when i said uh  hey guys it's uh dustin oh man so it's me yeah i'll be well we know we know what's going to be 
[02:56:30]  in celebrity boxing three now there you go yeah i think what we said ladies and gentlemen it's uh  screech uh andy what's up help us out yeah i just wanted to know why uh dustin there thought he beat  ali after he beat horseshock dancing around the ring like he did oh i'm supposed to just bend over and  say thank you insult me again yeah you should well how about i take you on god absolutely yeah 
[02:57:00]  right when and where you'd be afraid of me yeah you're right i'd be afraid you'd try and uh i don't  know oh yeah that's a good one yeah that's a good one that's yeah well oh even the listeners suck  what are you calling me from new orleans come on could you at least pretend to have confidence in  that i didn't have anything to say you know i didn't i don't have the background of saved by the  bell you know you know how bad you'd feel if you say you got your ass kicked by screech you  wouldn't have you wouldn't be able to leave the house oh you're absolutely right well good thank  you all right and thank cut oh one more thing no it's not gonna work that caller was one sentence 
[02:57:30]  away from going why i ought to wait jim gaffigan stood up all right i just stood up because i thought  maybe it would help i don't know mike is saying i don't know what i'm doing i thought you were  gonna start a fight or something mike said june 7th it must be a curse thinking back at last year yeah  every seven was our first day in philly every two and seventh we're gonna our show was horrible  a year ago we remember it was our first day in philly and it stunk on ice and now today well 
[02:58:00]  look be more gooder well let's just we're getting people that have poor grammar dimitri what's up yeah  i just want to know where screech is playing so i won't accidentally walk in oh man shut up so how  how did how did uh the end there's a room of like six people here and uh i'm the one that's  targeted right yeah target dustin diamond you can't just blame dustin we've all stink yeah see no no  no it's a mcguire yeah it was definitely uh i i blame it on uh jim gaffigan i think jim's got 
[02:58:30]  some responsibility here to uphold his end i just want to know he's reading a commercial log at this  point i'm not the pedophile all right are you reading what did what did i do a movie script  i'm trying to do a radio show i'm doing some work here i mean was jim safe because he was quiet  more than i was that might have been a good strategy on jim's part yeah that was a very  probably good strategy on our part on the whole show sometimes for an audition yeah sometimes you got  to know when to just keep quiet yeah i just yeah i'm just listening i'm listening and learning you guys 
[02:59:00]  are the pros you know learn the price of fame that's what you get you know what certainly is  well you know makes an easy target like the last caller the last thing he said is like  well i want to know how is it my fault he's well he's screech that's what he said before he before  he was cut off you know so i guess you know being screech is the easy target yeah demetrius from philly  is saying that uh those uh percentages that tim sabian was giving off earlier about how much 
[02:59:30]  percentage we've gone up in philly yeah over the past year has just went down 23.9 percent across  the board and they're still dropping i took three hours of my life away and i want it back says then  noel yo anybody many good any of them guys wear a wig get them out of here huh you know i don't  more and more that the callers keep calling in i'm not feeling bad about their insults i mean  you know no one has anything today thank god next year out there no one june 7 falls on a saturday

[03:24:30]  well dustin had to get to his uh it's a long drive it's it's long island it's a long drive it's  friday it's a rush hour he had to leave early  is what i'm saying where was patrice and voss uh bob what's going on how you doing guys all  right i hear chicago's running a best of minor league hockey tonight all right and tim sabian  jumped all right uh take it easy that's a cute little joke for chicago because they take the  show in uh tape delay and instead they know how bad the show's gonna be why bother why bother running 
[03:25:00]  it so minor league hockey best though yes jim norton i don't know if i'm all i don't know if i  i haven't heard any official word at all but it doesn't i don't know it could not be true but  i'm not sure if colin's show is going to go it doesn't look like it will and i just want to say  what a disgrace it is that the networks will not pick up such a brilliant comic and his show it's a  disgrace oh it's a disgrace wow more tragedy happening really makes me want to vomit more tragedy 
[03:25:30]  uh jim gaffigan would you like to share i i tell you colin quinn is a really really funny guy  we all know that oh hell yeah we've had him in here break away and that show was really solid  and it was a great vehicle for norton to get off the show you know what just just his monologues  it's so aggravating that somebody's so goddamn funny gives them such great brilliant political  stuff and they don't want it you're putting chiseled chin people on and wonder why cable is  smashing you nobody's watching your faggot sitcoms we are so consumed with beauty in this country it is 
[03:26:00]  ridiculous i mean compared to like like british television it's like you watch that and it's  like watching an orville reddenbacher commercial it's like you're like where'd they get all these  ugly people but we put like beautiful people on that are like boring as sticks and again we have  them at least the british people are homely and boring but you weren't you weren't boring on tv i was  not no jim's funny but i i'm not i'm not handsome enough to keep on there i guess is that what it was

[03:33:00]  she 14 why do you videotape that first of all you shouldn't do it and b you shouldn't tape it  stupid why does this show always go back to pedophilia well it's you know what this is this  is a hot news story that people are talking about i'll say even hot off the presses even cnn is uh  discussing right and all i'm saying it you first of all you don't tape yourself having sex ever i know  why do that i brought up a point the other day a bunch of people have had videotapes of uh  graduations and weddings and anything else and then uh you think what happened to those tapes do you 
[03:33:30]  you remember nah you move you lose some same thing happens to the uh sex tapes and they wind up  on the internet and whatnot so i i have no idea why anyone would do that if you want to see yourself  having sex on television you can prop the camera up without a tape in there yeah and look ridiculous  doing it last thing i would want to see is myself having sex it's yeah why why do that yeah go with  the mirrors there's no reason to videotape yourself what's that i got photographs of my mule i thought
