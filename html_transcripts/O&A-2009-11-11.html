<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with self-deprecating humor about their history of controversial content, immediately transitioning to a darkly comedic discussion of the D.C. sniper's execution.  The hosts debated capital punishment methods, expressing a preference for more brutal alternatives to lethal injection, and speculated, in a darkly humorous way, about the sniper's final moments.  This segued into a fictionalized, humorous segment about a caller named "Ted" who invented a deadly electric chair with a metal floor, leading to a discussion about the lack of modern updates to electric chair technology.  The conversation then shifted to the movie *Angels with Dirty Faces* and its parody in *Home Alone 2*, prompting a trivia segment and discussion of the film's role in the franchise.

The show then addressed the Fort Hood shooting, with the hosts debating its causes and assigning blame, expressing frustration with political correctness hindering open discussion of the event's potential Islamic terrorist roots.  This segment included a discussion with a studio guest caller, Sobe, an Arab-American, who challenged the hostsâ€™ views and pointed out the underreporting of violence against Arab-Americans post-9/11. The conversation also touched on the difficulties of identifying and addressing homegrown terrorism. A significant tangent involved a listener's problem with a massive hornet's nest in his brother's attic, prompting absurd suggestions for its removal from the hosts and callers.  A brief discussion of Susan Boyle's media appearances and a funny moment involving one of the hosts finding a booger under the studio console concluded this segment.

The next segment started with a caller's humorous story about a colleague who sleeps so soundly he refuses to wake, even when struggling to breathe. This transitioned to a caller's experience at a World of Warcraft convention where they were unexpectedly on Ozzy Osbourne's setlist while announcing contest winners.  The conversation then took several bizarre turns, including a caller's video of their dog having sex with a stuffed elephant, leading to a discussion of R. Kelly and comparisons to Roberto Duran. Stories about comedian Keith Robinson, including a tense Madden game with a South Boston mob associate and his appearance on Wanda Sykes' show, followed.  A significant portion focused on the hosts' reaction to Sharon Osbourne's comments about Susan Boyle, highlighting the extensive media coverage of the ensuing controversy and featuring clips of Boyle's *Dancing with the Stars* performance interspersed with the hosts' vulgar commentary.  The segment concluded with a call from a "lady trucker" and a discussion about the Affordable Care Act with Dr. Aaron Carroll in studio.  This included a debate about the bill's merits, flaws, the definition of socialism, and the role of government regulation in healthcare.  Anthony made a factual error regarding vaccine distribution priorities, which was corrected.

The discussion about the ACA continued in the next segment, with Dr. Aaron Carroll participating.  Disagreements continued on the definition of socialism and the bill's practicality.  This was interspersed with an advertisement for CougarLife.com and a brief discussion of *Used Cars*. The hosts also lamented a missed opportunity to interview Chaz Bono. Rob Halford, the lead singer of Judas Priest, then joined the show.  The conversation covered Halford's coming out, his career, Judas Priest's music, and their potential Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.  The hosts and Halford discussed the band's history, music videos, and the challenges of maintaining his vocal abilities. A listener called in to discuss Judas Priest's *Nostradamus* album. The segment concluded with further discussion of the band and Halford's life, with frequent use of vulgar and sexually suggestive language.

The final segment featured a continued studio interview with Rob Halford. The conversation focused on Judas Priest's British Steel tour, including setlist variations and their surprisingly successful cover of Joan Baez's "Diamonds and Rust."  Halford recounted a heartwarming meeting with Joan Baez and his unexpected last-minute performance with Black Sabbath in Philadelphia, filling in for an ill Ozzy Osbourne. He described the initial shock and then enthusiastic acceptance of the crowd, along with being hit with a beer bottle and a loogie early in the performance.  The hosts and Halford discussed his clothing line, "Metal God Clothing," and his business ventures, drawing comparisons to Jay-Z. The segment ended with Halford performing a rock scream on request, followed by a brief call from Atlanta regarding the "Diamonds and Rust" cover, and the hosts signing off.  Penn Jillette was mentioned as a scheduled guest earlier in the broadcast, but no interactions with him were detailed in the provided summaries.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We'll be in Anthony, are no strangers to scandal.  We'll be in Anthony on Satellite Radio, host Anthony Camilla and Greg Copey, he's a controversial team.  Good comment, profanity list, and Anthony.  We'll be in Anthony apologizing for yet another launch gag.  We'll be in Anthony show.  We'll be in Anthony.  Who is this the last straw for the launching radio duo?  The launching radio show?  Disturbed and deviant.  There's nothing I enjoy more than drunken teen girls.  The history of misogynistic behavior. 
[00:00:30]  The home of incest and anal sex.  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.  I am a fucking lunatic.  That's not shocking.  I love it!  What a freak show.  What a Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey freak show.  Best of our abilities.  We'll try really hard every day.  What are we going to do?  Best of our abilities or a good show?  This is what the show is.  It's silly.  It's stupid.  Whatever you want to call it, listen to it and like it or don't.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  DC Sniper is dead.  He's dead.  Goodbye.  Bye-bye.  They make it easy for him, though.  I know.  No last words.  No nothing.  He just went in, laid down, got a little fucking, you know, shot in the arm, and went  to sleep, and then they shut his organs down.  It's nice.  So wait, he didn't, he could have had last words, but he didn't? 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, I don't think he said much.  They said he was very, he didn't say anything.  They said that he was very relaxed, but I hear they give you all sorts of stuff to  mellow you out a little bit before they give you the big injection.  Before the Green Mile walk?  Come on, I want old school executions.  Come on!  It should be a lot fucking brutal and scarier.  I want the old fucking, what was it, Sparky?  Riding the old Sparky.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to fire up Sparky again.  Yes, ride the lightning.  Where there's always a problem.  They gotta hook him back up because they didn't give him enough juice or something. 
[00:02:00]  Or that dummy didn't fucking wet the sponge.  Right.  I love that one.  All of a sudden, the top of the head explodes, but the guy's still alive.  Fire shooting out his eyeballs.  All that stuff.  You gotta kill somebody.  You gotta go old school.  I heard that when, a lethal injection, though, it can be like suffocating internally.  Yeah, but the thing is, physically, yeah, you're, supposedly, people that have seen it,  you're laying there going like, you know, because you can't breathe. 
[00:02:30]  But, you're fucking asleep.  You're unconscious.  Right.  Unconscious.  You're not, you're not sitting there like, oh my god, I can't breathe.  You're asleep.  And then you just don't wake up.  I would assume they're giving you something as strong as like propofol or something.  What?  Which, which I had recently.  You have no memory of, of going through a procedure.  That's it.  So if they're giving you something like that, before they give you the drug that kills you,  what are you feeling?  He's just still waiting.  What are you feeling?  He's still waiting to wake up from surgery.  Right.  Like, when you get, when you go into surgery, and you go to sleep, they go, you know, count 
[00:03:00]  backwards, and then you go to sleep, and then all of a sudden you're in recovery, waking  you up, like, and it seems like it was a second.  And you're like, what happened, what happened?  Oh, everything went fine.  You're just in recovery.  You're like, wow, that was amazing.  Right.  Time travel.  Right.  Well, for him, he's just waiting.  He's just waiting.  He's sitting there going, well, when the fuck am I going to wake up?  I think he's frozen in time right now.  He's frozen in time.  The execution should be whatever the guy did.  So the D.C. sniper, you snipe him to death. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Why not?  They don't do that, though.  Why?  Because we're a civilized society and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Cruel and unusual punishment.  But he's done.  D.C. sniper, 9-11 last night, I do believe.  Relatively quickly, as far as executions go, from 2002 until 2009, you know, you see some  of these things go 25 years.  Seven years.  Seven years is, you know, with the death penalty case, it was so clear cut, too. 
[00:04:00]  I mean, this motherfucker was guilty.  There wasn't one of those things where it's like, free Muhammad.  He didn't do it.  Although his lawyer was claiming right up to the end that he was innocent.  Fucking lawyer should have been in there, too.  Should have strapped.  They should fucking do that.  They should have two gurneys in those rooms.  One for the fucking defendant and one for the lawyer.  You lose the case because you were pitching this fucking guy as being innocent.  You get to die right next to him.  Unless you say, hey, that guy's guilty as shit. 
[00:04:30]  Let's slow down and think about this.  Maybe these lawyers won't be taking on these obvious cases.  You want to take this case on?  Well, here's the consequence.  If he's found guilty, so are you.  And you will get his sentence.  You're going to get the same sentence.  How great would that be?  At least they'd be a little more honest about it, where it's like, all right, look.  Every lawyer at that point, every defense lawyer, the first thing out of their mouth would be like,  okay, look, I know he did it, but here's why. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  This is why he should get, like, less of a sentence.  And we'd get rid of scumbag lawyers.  They wouldn't be quick to take on a lot of these cases.  No.  Can you tell we hate lawyers?  Fuckers.  Let's go to Space Trucker.  Space Trucker, we haven't heard from you in a while.  What's up?  Well, I just thought you all might be interested to know that in the state of Kentucky, we've still used the electric chair.  Really?  You've seen the electric chair?  I've been the foreman on the grand jury twice in Lyon County, Kentucky, where the Eddyville State Penitentiary is. 
[00:05:30]  And the grand jury has to inspect the prison.  So I have singled Sparky, and it will chill your blood.  Yeah, huh?  It's an old wooden chair with these big metal clamps.  Green Mile did a really good mock-up.  Green Mile, if you watch that, you'll see what the electric chairs look like.  Like, why is it that the electric chair is, like, the only thing that hasn't been updated for forever? 
[00:06:00]  It's this old, like, it's nailed together fucking two-by-fours and shit, old wood, and these big metal clamps and shit like that.  How come they haven't made a sleek, nice electric chair?  Like, everything else has been updated.  You'd think they would make it nice and comfy.  Update the electric chair.  Get some nice armrests.  Yeah, like, look at our office chairs that we have.  They don't look like the office chairs from the 50s, where, you know, Beaver Cleaver's dad would be sitting in the office. 
[00:06:30]  These are very modern and everything.  The electric chairs, they should have, like, clamps that go around the arms electrically.  Not some guy screwing down the thing.  Some sci-fi movie shit.  Yeah, they got all that stuff.  It's not out of the realm of possibility.  How do you get a company to build a new one?  Build a new electric chair.  That's where I'm going.  Don't steal this idea.  Me and Danny are going to get drunk and discuss how we can get a new electric chair, Mark. 
[00:07:00]  Wait, Anthony, is there a company out there somewhere that might be interested in execution chairs?  I don't know if there would be a company, maybe a young entrepreneur, that would run a company that does nothing but make new electric chairs.  Yeah, there's got to be some kind of company out there.  Some young go-getter.  Someone that's done a lot of things.  That's an entrepreneur that might actually make... 
[00:07:30]  I know exactly what you're trying to do.  You'd like me to discuss the opening and closing of Ted's Hopstein Emporium.  I know exactly what you're doing.  You're trying to humiliate me again.  Opening and closing, what happened?  You didn't do very well.  What happened, Ted?  Because I opened up, it was a big metal chair with little electric things.  Yes, that's kind of what it's supposed to be.  And they were no straps, and you just sit down, and they plug it in and zap you.  What happened is, I had a metal floor I sold with it. 
[00:08:00]  All the workers were dying.  I'm being sued.  Litigation, huh?  Yes, litigation is killing me.  My insurance only covered me up to $4,200.  How many people died?  Seven.  That could be a little more than that.  I think so, yes.  I've been $385,971.48 so far.  Why the metal floor?  That seems stupid.  I just thought it would sound funny if somebody dropped change on it.  I like the sound of ting-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling when they drop a nickel on the floor.  You're trying to taunt me, Gregor. 
[00:08:30]  I know exactly what you're doing.  I won't be a part of it.  Ted's Hopstein Emporium didn't do well.  Hopstein Emporium has got a catchy name.  It certainly does.  I had 10,000 hats made with my insignia.  Why would you have hats made, Gregor?  Well, because everybody loves a hot seat hat, Gregor.  That's what I was told.  It's like a little promotional thing.  A young lady told me that while we were whispering sweet nothings to each other in the bedroom.  Sweet nothings.  Yes.  What did you say?  I said, I wonder why I should get a hat that applies how people die. 
[00:09:00]  And she said, how about Ted's Hopstein Emporium hat?  I said, that's very good.  Ugh.  You come fast.  I certainly do.  I want to ask the person that might be playing Ted for the radio when he realized that we were talking about him.  Oh, I'd probably say about five minutes into the old Bob Saget, I was perusing.  And then I realized two people were saying something in my direction.  I wish I videotaped this. 
[00:09:30]  It and I are trying to get Jimmy to do Ted.  And Jimmy is deep into an article.  He has no idea.  I wonder what young entrepreneur would make new electric shows.  And Jimmy's got like his brow is furrowed and he's reading an article like, yeah, yeah.  And we're looking and going, oh no, he doesn't know what we're talking about.  And then he's slowly, and then you watch him slowly wake up, wake up to the fact that we're trying to get him to do Ted.  That's not true, Gregory.  I was being coy. 
[00:10:00]  Oh.  And then you start looking around the room like, uh-oh, I think they're talking about me.  Oh, fuck.  I was looking at this picture of Bob Saget and the Olsen twins.  Apparently they did a thing at Caroline's.  I was like, oh, fuck, it would have been cool.  When, last night?  I don't know.  It didn't say.  Why the fuck isn't Bob Saget coming in here anymore?  He is.  He probably was only in and out of town.  He probably comes in and out often.  But the Olsen twins, I'm like, fuck, man.  It's hard to get them together.  Yeah, we should get them on the show.  We got Jodie Sweetin in recently, huh?  That'd be nice.  Turn her boobies.  Yeah, but the Olsen twins aren't.  Not as hot as Jodie Sweetin, that's for sure.  Jodie Sweetin. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, they are.  That was a surprise to me.  What, how hot she was?  Yeah.  I knew she was kind of a weird-looking kid.  She had the lift and everything.  It was kind of weird, skinny and gangly.  And then she grows up and, wow.  Had the big boobs.  Wowie Kazaui.  Oh, I like that one.  Let me say hi to Jeff in Delaware.  Jeff?  Yeah, how are you doing? 
[00:11:00]  Pretty good, Jeff.  I don't want to talk about the electric chair.  It's like, why do you want to fix something that's not broke?  That does its job.  That's there to kill people.  I mean, what the hell?  I guess they want it to look intimidating.  Like, anyone who's still using, any state that's still using the electric chair doesn't  want their victims, not victims, believe me, I am all for it, but the people that will  be sitting in the chair, I guess they don't want them to be comfy at all.  Like, they don't want them to look at the chair and go, oh, that's kind of nice. 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  Smooth lines.  It's good.  It's electric beanbag.  Ergonomically designed.  That is an uncomfortable chair that you're not going to be sitting in for long, is what  it is.  I'm kind of mad that we're all comfortable with the fact that we say, wow, this execution  happened quickly.  Yeah, yeah.  We only had to wait seven years.  That's good.  I know.  It is.  You hear how we've become as a society?  Hey, not bad.  Only seven years.  Yeah, seven years.  That's it. 
[00:12:00]  It should have happened immediately.  Yeah.  Well, he didn't seem to, he's one of those guys that didn't seem to mind.  No.  He's a sociopath.  A complete sociopath.  Yeah.  I think the time fucks it up, though.  It does something to people where they accept it.  A lot of people find religion.  A lot of people accept the fact that they're going to be put to death and they're at peace  with it.  Like, I want to see these guys being dragged screaming.  You never hear that.  Witnesses said he was dragged screaming, going, no, no, please, no. 
[00:12:30]  I don't want to be killed.  Like, that would be great.  You read that and go, wow, that's horrible.  Yeah.  You know?  We're the only Western country that still puts people to death.  So I'm saying it's like you want it to be as clean looking as possible because cruel  and unusual punishment is the article, is the thing people use against it.  Oh, death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment.  The Constitution says you can't have cruel.  And if you made it look like you were dragging somebody, quartering them by horses, people would  look at that and go, we can't accept that regardless of what the guy did.  So it's quiet and it's clean.  To me, the object is to get the roach squashed. 
[00:13:00]  They could fight that, though, just saying like, hey, we can't control how fucking freaked  out this guy is that he's going to be meeting his maker or, you know, worse.  We want to see the guy kicking and screaming.  Yeah, I want to see him dragging them all the way.  Oh, my God.  Just ripping his nails off his fingers.  You ever see that movie, that movie, um, his claws wave?  No, no.  It's an old movie.  And, um, I think it's that guy that squished the fucking grapefruit in that girl's face.  That guy that used to play gangster in all the movies. 
[00:13:30]  Cagney.  Yeah, I think it was James Cagney.  James Cagney.  And he was a criminal.  And the kids, like, really, the neighborhood kids, you know, it was like the little rascals  and fucking shit like that.  They loved him and thought he was cool and everything like that.  And finally, he committed a murder and he was going to be put to death.  And he's spitting in the fucking guards' faces and he goes, yeah, I'm going to go sit there  and I'm going to curse you out.  He's just really being obnoxious and saying he's going to sit in that chair. 
[00:14:00]  So a priest comes and visits him and goes, look, these kids are going to see this.  He goes, if there's one last decent thing you could do, he goes, don't make yourself  a martyr to these kids who look up to you as a criminal.  And he's like, whatever, whatever.  And as he starts walking, he does this bad acting thing where he's like, no, no, please  don't kill me.  No, don't kill me.  See?  See?  Don't kill me.  And then it came out in the paper that he was a coward.  And they're all like, oh, he was yellow. 
[00:14:30]  He was yellow.  And the kids all saw that he was just a pussy at heart.  But the priest knew.  Like, he was the one that knew.  And he kind of looked at him like, you know.  Like, look, he's all tough-faced.  That's it.  Angels with dirty faces.  Let's find this.  That is it.  I don't want to die.  Oh, please.  I don't want to die.  Oh, please.  Oh, don't make me cry.  Oh, please.  Oh, please. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, please.  Please.  Oh, please.  Oh, please.  Just strapping him in.  He's holding on to the radiator.  All the witnesses are watching.  Oh, yeah.  That was it.  That's a good one.  See, but he didn't really mean that. 
[00:15:30]  The yellow rat was going to spit in my eye.  Yeah.  The yellow rat.  But he did it as a last gesture.  Rocky dies.  Yella.  Kill a coward at an end.  Wait.  He did it as a gesture for what?  To show the kids here.  See, the kids are reading the paper now.  That he tore himself in the God's grass.  Because the kids loved him.  He thought he was cool.  So he did.  He looked up to him.  And if he would have gone out like a criminal, spit in people's eyes, they'd have been like, 
[00:16:00]  wow, he's a tough guy.  We've got to be just like him.  But now he looks all yellow.  And the kids, like, go, ah, fuck him.  Rocky Sullivan died at cop.  God.  God.  Who's that guy?  That guy reading the paper looks familiar.  Yeah, he does.  He's some kid.  He's probably fucking Jimmy Olsen or something.  What a great name for a movie.  Angels with dirty faces.  Dirty faces.  What a great name for a movie.  They fucking...  That's a classic, man.  But he was.  He was going to spit in the guy's eye and just be like, yeah, put me to death.  I don't care, see?  Meh.  And then the priest talked to him and he was like, you know, come on, one right thing in 
[00:16:30]  your life, you asshole.  Right here.  Nah.  Nah, don't kill me, see?  Nah.  Tom in D.C.  What's up, Tom?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Don't kill me, see?  I was through that D.C. sniper here in Montgomery County, Maryland, just over the D.C. line.  And I just thank God he went over to Virginia and killed somebody, so he's dead now.  Because if he had been tried here, he would still be eating and living and walking around.  Yeah, they picked a good state. 
[00:17:00]  They had a statement from, I guess, the prosecutor.  And, oh, boy, it sounded like fucking, it sounded like 18 fucking 40.  Oh, yeah.  This guy, any time that accent comes up, he's like, well, we put him to death at about 9  11 p.m. last night.  And that colored boy ain't gonna be doing nothing else to no white people.  No, I mean, the, uh, that's how he sounded like.  That's the last time he cuts a white lady on line at the market. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  The last time he winks at a young white girl.  He claims something was in his eye.  We feel different.  Now, he was put to death, yet he did use the wrong drinking fountain.  Imagine that's the real reason they put him to death.  And not all the sniper shootings.  Like, fuck.  Yeah, he was a scumbag.  He couldn't even apologize.  A lot of times victims' families go for apologies.  They really do want an apology.  They want to hear something from him.  It means something.  They want to hear anything like, uh, I didn't know what I was doing. 
[00:18:00]  I'm sorry.  Or even, you know, I have no remorse for what I did.  Like, anything to get some kind of insight on why the fuck you did this to my loved one.  And he just gave nothing.  Yeah, he was a complete piece of shit.  I mean, a complete piece of shit.  Don't kill me.  See?  Man, man.  Don't kill me, yo.  We got, we got useless trivia that's based on that movie.  Oh, really?  Wait, wait.  You want to figure it out?  Don't look down at the screen.  Useless trivia coming in about that movie.  Is it the same movie? 
[00:18:30]  Angels with Dirty Faces.  Is it the same movie as The Grapefruit?  No.  No.  Well, I don't know that.  I don't know that.  Oh, one of the people in it?  Probably one of the kids grew up to be an actor.  I don't know that.  Well, he was an actor.  Yes.  Shit.  Maybe one of the kids grew up to be fucking put to death.  This useless trivia, most people would go, holy cow.  Okay.  What's it about?  Like, what's it?  Yeah, yeah, good.  It's also a porno movie name.  Angels with Dirty Faces.  Or Iraq went to buy it and asked for angles with dirty faces. 
[00:19:00]  Or Angels with Dirty Faces.  It's German.  Angels with Dirty Faces.  No, it's German.  It's Angels with Dirty Faces.  Younger generations know this movie.  They do?  That's your clue.  Okay.  It was remade?  That's your clue.  It was remade?  That's your clue.  I don't believe it was remade, no.  Okay.  Why would younger generations know this movie?  Hence the useless trivia. 
[00:19:30]  If that guy, if the guy who wrote that trivia says that it was featured in the movie Bad Boys  with Sean Penn, it was featured in a movie, though?  No.  Ah!  I misread Gregorio's acting.  So it was in the background on a TV in a movie?  Where are you going with this?  I thought I was pretty clear there.  Where are you going? 
[00:20:00]  How else would it be?  It's like...  Oh, my God.  Ah!  You look down?  Nope.  You got it?  That was the movie that young fucking Macaulay Culkin put on...  You're looking right at the screen!  There's Macaulay Culkin!  He just put it on.  Oh.  That he put it on and used some of the dialogue to scare away the bad guys. 
[00:20:30]  Let's go to Sean in Albany.  Sean!  Ah!  It wasn't that movie.  It was parodied.  It was called Angels with Filthy Souls in that movie, and it was parodied.  Oh, it was parodied.  What do you mean it was parodied?  Well, that's terrible then, so it's not really trivia.  In Home Alone 2, it was Angels with Filthy Souls.  They probably couldn't get the rights to show any of the movies, so they didn't just please do the joke of it.  Now, see?  Whoa, whoa.  Let's slow down a little bit.  I'm very confused.  Was it the actual movie that was...  No.  I guess they...  I always thought that was an old movie. 
[00:21:00]  I guess they just, like, made something that they could use...  That looked like it.  ...for that.  Yeah.  Oh, what?  Did you know that?  I just always assumed it was some old movie.  I thought it was, yeah, an old movie.  We should bring Devin Rattray in here and grill him relentlessly about what happened behind the scenes.  He would have no...  I don't know.  I don't know.  And then we'd just keep fucking grilling up.  We'd just be really aggressive to him.  Like an interrogation.  Yeah, like really vicious to him about how, you know, like, what the fuck's he doing with himself? 
[00:21:30]  And it all comes down to, we want to know, what was the fucking copyright issue, you motherfucker?  Yeah, there it is.  The movie that Kevin watches on videotape is not a real film, but footage is specially created.  I did not know this.  It was called Angels with Filthy Souls, along with other similar era references in the movie.  This is a play upon the movie Angels with Dirty Faces, starring James Cagney.  Nah.  Did you know that?  That was pretty good.  Nah, I didn't know that.  James Cagney's a great scene at the end of... 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, I knew you'd cheat because I saw it pop up and you went, oh, it was the worst, I just figured that out thing.  Of course I cheated.  I can see the reflection of Macaulay in your fucking eyeballs.  Ah, Bloomington, Jackson.  I'm a rat, see?  Kevin, what's up?  What's going on, bu-bu-bu-bu-boy?  Hey, man.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  I hate this.  We're talking about the, uh, don't kill me, don't kill me.  There's a great deal with the Crips, where in the beginning of the episode, the guy is actually the executioner, 
[00:22:30]  and then the state goes and cancels all executions.  So he goes around and starts killing people, and then at the end of the episode,  he becomes the person who's going to be killed,  and they're actually dragging his sorry ass to the execution chamber,  and he's screaming, the governor's gonna call, the governor's gonna call!  Anyway, brush it out, boys.  I was waiting for his next fucking word with great anticipation.  We kind of did that on purpose to the guy. 
[00:23:00]  Uh, Matt in Boston, what's up, Matt?  I have great news for Ted.  If he can get those legal problems resolved,  Obama's extending energy-saving tax credit if we can come up with a more efficient chair.  Yes, I know!  I put in a request.  It was actually a letter I wrote to the president,  but I think I spelled Obama with two Ms.  Oh, that's not good.  They're not gonna take me seriously.  No, not at all, Ted.  You should at least spell his name right.  I tried to be funny.  I went, dear Mr. Prez.  I put a Z.  That's cool.  Yeah, I figured, you'd think I was one of the hyper-newer people of the generation. 
[00:23:30]  So...  I don't talk politics.  No?  No!  I like to mix people up.  I yelled at President Obama once on the TV,  because I thought he went to Canada during Vietnam!  What else is going on?  That fucking...  You know that Twitter shit my dad says?  A bunch of people are following that.  I'm fucking disgusted with...  This will depress Jimmy, too.  Some guy comes up with a Twitter account that shit my dad says. 
[00:24:00]  It blew up.  He got 700,000 followers in a month.  Yeah, works on Twitter.  Something like that.  That's great, whatever.  Well, he just got signed to a TV deal.  They're making a TV show.  Based on his tweets, shit my dad says.  You know why?  They could fill up a half hour for dirt fucking cheap.  This show won't cost anything,  but they don't realize you get what you pay for.  So this is going to go down in history 
[00:24:30]  as something like the Caveman show from the Geico commercials.  And what was that other thing they came up with?  Yeah, we had another example.  Yeah.  That's funny, though.  It's just some funny lie.  I mean, it's probably a TV show.  I don't know, but that's...  Oh, yeah.  Funny line.  There's a list of shows there  that we got to kind of think about.  That's a clever idea.  Whoever did that on Twitter,  I mean, I got to...  It's a fucking good idea.  Really?  Yeah.  Is it worth the show in Hollywood?  No, but they're thinking,  like, this is the dad character. 
[00:25:00]  You know how they fucking...  Yeah.  We can write around this.  I was telling him before the show,  then this guy would get to Hollywood,  and then the lawyers and the network  and the censors would get involved.  Oh, they'll water it down.  And they'll water it down to a point  where it's one of the biggest bombs  in recent memory on TV.  Exactly.  And then they'll all be going,  well, I don't understand  why this didn't work on TV.  What happened?  It worked great on Twitter,  but it doesn't work on TV.  What happened?  And they'll be scratching their heads.  Yeah.  They'll fuck it up.  Oh, I'm sorry.  We have to watch Oprah today  because the fucking Chimp Lady is on. 
[00:25:30]  And I were talking about it before the show.  Yeah, Chimp Lady's on Oprah today.  Everybody watch.  Yes.  That's your homework assignment  for tomorrow's show.  What a horrid story, too.  I was reading that,  and she actually thought  up until just a couple of weeks ago  that she was going to be able to see again.  They never told her  they had to remove her eyeballs.  She just didn't know.  She thought someday  she'd be able to see again.  Her face was ripped the fuck off.  And they were talking about 
[00:26:00]  how she's really disfigured her lip,  her eyelid,  her nose is gone,  just her cheeks, chin.  And then she said  she wants to be able to see her daughter  go to her prom.  It's like,  could you just maybe leave the prom thing alone?  Yeah.  Maybe it's her day.  Please, no distractions  like old monkey food face.  We don't need that. 
[00:26:30]  Let the girl have her day.  Oh, my mom's bringing me to the...  She lost her nose, hands,  and eyelid and lips.  And her neck.  Both her hands?  God, surgery removes her eyes  due to an infection.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, you get monkey spit in your eyes.  Yeah, I guess they...  Oh, filthy monkey spit.  Digging dirt into her eyes, yeah.  You know what they do?  They stick their fingers in their assholes  and then lick it.  And then she...  She...  She got monkey shit teeth 
[00:27:00]  in her eyeballs.  Ow.  God damn.  Yeah, so we'll see what she has to say  on Oprah today.  She wears a veil  throughout her TV appearance.  Does she?  Is she Muslim?  What happened?  What happened?  Why, man?  Oprah should force her  to take the veil off.  Take the veil!  She won't be able to see  what Oprah would do.  Oh, yeah.  She would rip the veil off her face.  No!  I don't want people  to see my monkey-eating face! 
[00:27:30]  Take the veil!  Take the veil!  The eyes are the fucking worst.  People will see me.  Yeah, but she won't see  the reaction  of the horrified audience.  No, but she'll hear...  She'll hear a lot of gas.  She'll hear...  Hi, this is my mom.  She got something  that dropped louder.  She's at an audience  that's just full  of emphysema patients.  What the fuck was that?  She'll look around.  Why are people yucking?  Oh.  Yuck.  Poor lady, man.  12 minutes. 
[00:28:00]  Like, if you...  You ever get bitten  by your girl  or something joking around  like she's put your...  Like that...  Ow!  Can you imagine  fucking chimp teeth?  For 12 straight minutes  like that.  They aren't stopping!  You know how long  12 minutes is  when a monkey  is eating your face?  You gotta feel like 13!  At least...  The fucking...  Just those nails  digging into your fucking face  and ripping...  They don't clip them  and use an emery board.  It probably bit her nose off. 
[00:28:30]  It probably fucking  bit her nose off.  It did.  Just bit her fucking nose off.  Any protuberance  is doomed  with a monkey.  Ears.  Eyelids.  Just clawing at her face.  Ripping her eyeballs.  Ah.  Fucking...  Her lip.  She was probably screaming  like,  Ah!  I'll shut you up.  I'll bite your fucking lip off.  Must have been like  how we attack a lobster.  Oh, where you're just  ripping and trying  to get the meat out  and eating.  Sucking.  You think you used  a big nutcracker 
[00:29:00]  on her head?  Yeah.  Trying to get to those  tasty brains.  To the soft meat.  Chimps are fucking brutal.  Oh, this is, uh,  this just in.  Russ in Pennsylvania.  Yes, Russ.  Yeah, so is Maury  going to have her on  and have a guy  come out in a chimp suit  to see if she's  recovered dramatically?  Oh, look, the chimp  is chasing her.  Look out now.  Look out.  Ha ha ha.  As he's laughing,  she's fucking falling  on the floor  in a catatonic state.  Okay, okay, enough. 
[00:29:30]  All right, enough, enough.  You are beautiful.  You're a beautiful person inside.  And we can see your insides  through your face,  so I know you're beautiful.  Good job, Russ.  Good job.  All right.  God damn, that's brutal.  But she's on, uh,  Ofra.  Ofra.  She's on the Ofra show.  Good old Ofra  getting the big guest  this, uh, season.  Just joking.  Uh, and we're a little  late on this one,  but the drunk woman  in, uh, Boston  that falls on the subway tracks. 
[00:30:00]  Wow, that was amazing.  How the fuck did the subway  stop just short of her?  It really did.  I think we've all seen  the video by now, right?  It's fucking stopped  on top of her.  It was right there.  It just kind of pushed  her a little bit.  Just a little,  little tap at the end.  Yeah, that was a movie  train stopping  before it hit somebody.  Yeah.  It only happens  in the movies.  Here's the story.  Boston Transit Police  say the woman was drunk  and she sure looked like it.  Security cameras  show her wobbling,  stumbling,  suddenly falling  onto the tracks 
[00:30:30]  of an oncoming train,  whoops,  unable to get up.  As she laid  between the tracks,  people waiting  in the station  started waving  for the train operator  to stop.  It was like  the people were waving,  but they were waving  a little bit too much  and they were really,  really close  to the yellow line.  And then as I'm approaching,  the lady pulls her head up  and I'm like,  oh my God,  someone's in the pit.  So I just threw it  in emergency,  exactly what I'm supposed  to do.  And it just,  it stopped just in time  not to hurt her.  The front end  of the train  was actually over her. 
[00:31:00]  She was under the train  and how she did not get here  to hit the third rail  is amazing  and we're very thankful  that the passengers  were able to stop  that train.  The most exciting part  for me was when  she crawled out  from under  and she was fine.  Anything,  any second,  any other thing  could have happened  and I'm just glad  it came out  the way that it did.  We all,  the subway operator  Sharice Lewis  is being hailed a hero.  She says she didn't have  time to think about it,  she just did it.  You hit the brake  because something's  on the track.  Exactly.  All right,  we get it, 
[00:31:30]  you're a hero.  I would have liked  if she thought  everybody was waving,  oh hurry,  we're late.  I love the correspondent,  he couldn't even  like swallow his lunch.  No!  How'd he give a statement  with a full mouth?  Look,  they're all fucking waving.  Are they doing aerobics?  What are they doing here?  Exactly.  Just stops in time,  look at that,  that's crazy.  That is fantastic.  Look at all the squares  which are like fucking  tracking and face recognition shit. 
[00:32:00]  What is going on  with that fucking camera?  What is she doing?  She's just drunkenly falling.  God,  a figure's a typical  Boston chick.  Yeah,  exactly.  Those are the type  of girls I fuck.  Two more drinks  and she'd fuck me.  That thing stopped,  yeah,  the coupler  for the front of that train  is right over her head  and then she just gets up  like,  what happened?  Look,  she's all,  I almost get hit by a train  and then the third rail  is like, 
[00:32:30]  she's lucky  it's on the other side.  Wait,  can you,  she really came close  when she fell backwards again?  What a stumble bum.  I want to hear you.  Death after a woman  fell onto the subway tracks.  Police say the 26-year-old woman  was drunk  and illegally smoking  on the platform on Friday.  Surveillance tape shows  when she tried to put out  that cigarette,  she stumbled  and fell onto the tracks.  As the headlights  from an oncoming train  came toward the station,  other riders,  as you saw just there,  tried to warn the driver.  Amazingly,  the train stopped  halfway over her body.  And look at her. 
[00:33:00]  It's amazing.  It looked like she was  passed out before the train came.  Look at the third rail.  I wonder if she was just  trying to lay perfectly still.  Look,  boom.  Or if she was asleep  in the train.  Get her arm pulled.  She didn't manage  to put her hand down  on the third rail.  Exactly.  Considering everything  that was going on,  she was,  whatever.  It's all right.  She lights a cigarette  off of it.  She has the worst hat  of her scene, too.  Really?  Don't like her hat?  There was any justice  to fucking train  when it kept going  and ripped the hat off  with her head on it.  No,  left her head attached  in it. 
[00:33:30]  Wow,  what a buzz, huh?  For the rest of her life,  she says,  I'm the lady  that almost,  that the train stopped over  and the girl.  Oh, yeah.  Do you think  that is a bottom  for her  where it's like,  now I really need  to get help?  Hell no.  And when people  years from now  ask her,  so what happened  to make you stop drinking?  Well,  it's like this.  You got an hour  she'll justify it  somehow in her mind  by saying,  ah, you know,  no, I know,  I was really drunk  but I lost my footing, 
[00:34:00]  you know,  I wasn't used to  those sneakers  I was wearing,  you know,  she'll find a way  to go back into it.  Oh, I know,  I've heard things.  Oh, the socks  were slippery  on my floor  and that's why  I fucking slipped  and fell on my head.  Right, Janine?  That was funny as shit.  What happened?  Oh, she was hammered at,  what was that,  the Halloween party  or something?  I don't know,  it was some party.  And then she just,  she had like white socks on  and my floors are slippery  and she just falls  on her ass.  First she fell down the stairs  and then she slipped 
[00:34:30]  and fell into one of my columns.  Was it a cartoon fall?  Oh, it was fantastic.  Did the fix just go flying?  Dude,  it was the funniest  goddamn thing.  There's nothing funnier  than watching people fall  and if it's your friends,  it's even funnier  as long as you know  they don't get too banged up.  A little dent is funny.  She's saying it didn't happen.  No,  I saw it.  It was pretty funny.  I heard the donk, donk, donk.  And then I look  at the bottom of my stairs  and there she is  and there she slides again  and hits one of the columns.  Tim in Brooklyn. 
[00:35:00]  Tim.  Yeah,  if you guys watch the video again,  there's a guy standing  on the platform  near the edge of the tunnel  and as the train stops  and knocks him dead  right in the head.  Now,  if that train wasn't able  to stop in time,  he probably would have  lost his head  and he's trying to wave  and stop the train,  the freaking idiot.  He was leaning over the tracks  far enough to get hit in the head.  I did notice this guy  because he's...  He's knocking the head a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  This guy's assuming  that the train will stop in time  and if it didn't,  he would be dead.  Watch the guy...  I kind of wish he lost his head.  That would have been hysterical. 
[00:35:30]  And he does bang his head  a little bit.  You got one guy  that goes all the way  to the end  and is trying to wave  the subway train down.  Yeah,  stop,  stop.  If the train doesn't stop,  this guy's fucked.  They all look like  they want to fly.  Watch,  he gets hit in the head  at the end.  Watch.  Blam.  She's probably yelling at him.  Like,  hey,  idiot,  what are you doing  pulling your fucking head out?  Right on,  man.  And a drunk  just gets up.  Hi,  who are you? 
[00:36:00]  I love  she falls back down again.  And they all help her up.  Yeah.  Fontaine,  what's up?  Yo,  Fontaine!  Gentlemen,  rape!  Jesus.  What's up,  Fontaine?  I got a pat  from Monoculine.  Oh,  you do?  Yeah.  You think  after this incident  she'll get her life  back on track?  I'm right back on track.  A life back on track.  That is indeed  a pat from Monoculine.  Pat's got to be flattered  when people call and go, 
[00:36:30]  I got a pat from Monoculine.  Oh,  great.  You know what?  She's already saying stuff.  Katie in Boston.  What's up,  Katie?  Hey,  boys,  it's my happy birthday,  Jimmy.  The girl that fell  on the tracks  is already denying  having an alcohol problem.  She had about  like three or four forties  before she fell in.  She's like,  oh no,  but I have no drinking problem.  Wow.  Three or four forties.  That's pretty impressive.  She seems okay.  Yeah.  She's just falling  in front of subway trains. 
[00:37:00]  I guess they found her  outside at the Cromia house.  Well,  in Boston,  that isn't really  a drinking problem.  To tell you the truth.  She was actually  not even too drunk  to drive legally in Boston.  Why wasn't anybody  brave enough  to jump on top of her  like they did in New York?  Yeah,  what happened there?  Where's the subway Superman?  Yeah,  they called him  the subway Superman.  He's psychotic.  The guy's crazy.  If you look,  in my humble opinion.  That track was a little different.  The subway Superman track  had like the railroad ties  are cut out in the middle. 
[00:37:30]  Right.  And he was able to go down  into like a ditch.  Right.  But here,  there were no,  yeah,  it's a little different.  Especially if you're  on top of somebody.  That woman would have been dead.  Never mind somebody  stacked up on top of her.  Let's say hi to Butch  in New Jersey.  Butch?  What's up gentlemen?  Hey Ann,  are you sure this wasn't  your ex-mother-in-law?  No,  that would have been impossible.  She's not with us anymore.  Yeah,  she passed.  Good old Judy.  Grandma,  yay.  Good old Judy.  And there was  Choo Choo. 
[00:38:00]  Well,  she had some moments.  Oh,  yeah.  She had a few moments.  My favorite is  how she got into the condo  next door to hers.  Yeah,  that was a good one.  And fell asleep on the couch  assuming it was her condo.  During a,  I guess the parents  were away  in the condo next door  so the kids were having  like one of those  fucking parties  you're not supposed to have.  But every kid has them.  But every kid has them.  Yeah.  And,  so she walked into  the wrong condo  and just walked to the couch. 
[00:38:30]  There's a huge keg party  going on.  Walks to the couch  and just falls down  and falls asleep  on the couch.  That's amazing.  God,  and they just like,  I think they left her there a while.  Yeah.  She's lucky  they didn't draw like  dick on her head.  You know how kids are  at those parties?  They're a little crazy.  Put it on YouTube.  Yeah.  It wasn't a YouTube back then.  It's the old days.  Why don't we take a break?  Boylegate,  day three.  No way.  Fuck yeah.  No way. 
[00:39:00]  It's still going.  They're still talking about  what Sharon Osbourne said  about Susan Brown  on our fine radio show.  Damn.  This time,  oh wow,  Inside Edition  and Access Hollywood  did another story on this?  Access Hollywood  and Inside Edition  are shit.  I watched one of those shows  yesterday  just for the fuck of it  to see what it was all about.  Yeah.  And I didn't see  any of the clips  so that's odd  but  There's a million of them.  Just Extra,  there's TMZ,  there's Entertainment Week,  Entertainment Tonight,  Inside Edition,  Access Hollywood.  So awful  and just 
[00:39:30]  the hypocrisy  of their  fake anger  at this situation  is so stupid  because all they were  talking about  at one point  I guess Dan Aykroyd  was out  trying to buy a car  and it's a picture  of him  now obviously  he's gained a lot of weight.  He's older.  He's old.  He's wearing short pants  with really bad  like untanned legs  and just old man legs  you know.  And they put the picture on 
[00:40:00]  and we're just going  Dan,  instead of the car  how about you buy some pants?  They're like laughing at him  and what's the difference  between that  and what Sharon said  about ugly fucking  Susan Boyle.  Because they're  fucking snotty  good looking people  who feel entitled  to throw a little jab  as long as it's done  in the parameters  of how they feel  that humor should be delivered.  Well you know what?  Dan Aykroyd's a celebrity  and so is Susan Boyle. 
[00:40:30]  Once she entered  that world  of celebrity  you know  then  especially in their eyes  it's the same thing.  Why can they make fun  of Dan Aykroyd  and not make fun of her?  Agreed.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All agreed.  The motion is passed.  Day three after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  We've got a busy show today.  Our friend Penn Jillette  is stopping by.  Does great radio. 
[00:41:00]  Oh yeah?  He'll be here around nine.  And then we've got  Rob Halford  at ten o'clock today.  What is he up to?  He's promoting.  He's actually got  a clothing line on.  And I've seen the shirts  I didn't realize  they were Halford  I actually like them  it's called Metal God  clothing line  and he's got  a fucking Christmas album  he just looks like  a psychopath on it  and it's just called  Halford Winter Songs.  What kind of songs  does he say?  Any familiar ones?  I don't know  if they're just remakes  The Three Kings  or We Three Kings  I can't read the writing  it's fucking like 
[00:41:30]  calligraphy writing  Yeah  Oh  Let me see if I can see it  That's difficult  That's not good  if you can't read the writing  I'm just an older man  You might have to yell  at Rob Halford  I can't read what it says  Oh Holy Night  Okay he probably  does do some more  Oh good  Because there's nothing worse  than a brand new  Christmas song  Yeah  It's the worst  I wonder if some of these  Just remake one of the old ones  Oh here's one  Christmas for everyone  I don't  Cave  You can't read that  I don't care 
[00:42:00]  probably  That's what I think  I don't  Holy Night  Uh oh  I don't cave  Come all ye faithful  Okay yeah  Faithful's in there  Light of the world  Are you showing me  where the track list is  I'm showing you  that he's redone  Classic ones  And he's also got  some new ones  Oh  So he does have  new Christmas songs  Oops  Okay  That could be a problem  Nothing worse  than when they  Alright  Alright so he'll be  talking about that  Cool  Yeah 
[00:42:30]  We haven't talked to him  in a long time  Huh  Yeah  Um  Yes  I just gotta bring up  something  What happened  A little offshoot  thing happening  with the Fort Hood  massacre  Yes  Which I consider  and a lot of other  people do  a terrorist attack  Can I guess  what the problem is  Domestically grown  terrorist  Yes  Uh Obama  No  No  Actually not  Took him five days  to go down there  Did it really  Well that's what  they're saying  Well he went  to the memorial  So  Yeah  And a situation 
[00:43:00]  like that  It's hard for Obama  to do anything  and not be bashed  by the other side  to tell you the truth  Oh I like how you think  Well it's true  Yeah he's just gonna  get bashed anyway  but um  I don't like the  blame game that's  going on  You know  They're like  who's to blame  Let's see  who had the  information  Who did this  Why don't we blame  uh  this uh  fucking savage  that did it  uh  Blame Al Qaeda  for their hatred  of um  uh  the western world  and  their influence  over weak-minded 
[00:43:30]  uh  douchebags  like this  fucking savage  uh  and  and uh  actually commend  the FBI  and uh  Central Intelligence  Agency  and whoever else  was in on this  for picking up on it  and investigating it  not knowing  not having a crystal ball  that this guy  is just gonna go  lunatic  and shoot a bunch  of people  um  The fact that they  were  onto him  is commendable  if you ask me  it's it's it's not like  they didn't know  anything about this guy  uh  the fact that 
[00:44:00]  as Americans  we sit there  and just try to  blame  ourselves  we try to find  some inner blame  well  oh it's gotta be  the government  it's gotta be the FBI  it's gotta be this  that  how come we can't  and and it goes back  to the conspiracy theorists  with 9-11  how come we can't  just blame it  on who the fuck  did it  this savage  was influenced  by a  uh  imam  from fucking  uh  a mosque  that that  the uh  world trade  center terrorists  uh  went to  um 
[00:44:30]  his his mind  was poisoned  by a  hateful  violent religion  and he took  that to heart  and decided  that um  instead of being  a soldier  for the American  uh  army  for the United  States  um  he was against  killing  Muslims  because he was a  Muslim  well you're an  American  first  if you're going  to war  as an  American  uh  in the  United  States  military  that is  first  not  I'm a  Muslim 
[00:45:00]  so  all  Muslims  as he said  should have  some kind  of exemption  uh  it doesn't  work that  way  he  uh  is a  domestically  grown  uh  Islamic  terrorist  and  enough  with trying  to blame  to find  blame  with our  own  government  the only  thing  is  where  we  should  find  blame  is  where  people  sense  something  was  wrong  or  they  were  saying  like  in speeches  about the  environment  he started  talking about  is the war  a war on  Islam  and somebody  questioned him 
[00:45:30]  and his  superiors were  afraid to go  after him  because they  didn't want to  appear politically  incorrect  that's where you  have to start  blaming the  military  again  there's a  but that's  a blame  on the  whole  fucking  society  that's a  blame  on what  the  pussification  of this  country  and the  fact that  we can't  let anyone  get upset  that the  one of the  generals  or commanders  what the fuck  was he saying  that he  hopes this  doesn't affect  the diversity  that was General Casey  the diversity 
[00:46:00]  of the military  like that's  important  the most  important thing  is a strong  military  fuck  it doesn't  have to be  diverse  it's not  a democratic  society  in the  military  we don't  have to  do things  that we  have to  do  here in  the outside  world  because  of the  threat  of the  scarlet  R  of racism  on your  shirt  then why  are they  doing it  because  we've  fallen  into the  pussification  exactly  and also  for a  general  to be  saying  that  for a 
[00:46:30]  fucking  general  to be  worried  about  diversity  after a  bunch  of his  soldiers  are  gunned  down  by a  radical  Muslim  who was  yelling  Allahu Akbar  as he  fucking  did it  is sickening  and Obama  I do have  a little  jab at  him too  during his  speech at  the memorial  service  not one  time did  he say  the word  terrorist  or terrorism  not once  did he even  say that  and this  I mean  stop  come on  please  he was  at the  very least  this fucking  lunatic 
[00:47:00]  was influenced  by terrorism  and Al Qaeda  and fascinated  by it  and  in the  end  use  their  tactics  to  strike  back  at  the  American  military  here  on  American  soil  how  is  that  not  terrorism  and this  is where  Obama  loses me  I like  Obama  I really  do  I think  he's  not a  scumbag  I think  his heart  is in  the right  place  I just  don't agree  with some  of his  stuff  but I  don't  dislike  him  at  all  but when  it  comes  to  this  shit  and  dealing  with  Islam  he  drives  me  fucking  nuts 
[00:47:30]  because  he  looks  at  it  like  I'm  going  to  show  that  the  Americans  are  compassionate  you're  looking  at  it  like  they're  these  legitimate  freedom  fighters  in all  aspects  instead  of  realizing  you know  what  their  religious  obsession  makes  them  as  irrational  and  vile  as  violent  abortion  bombing  obsession  there's  no  reasoning  with  that  type  of  religious  obsession  and  this  is  something  that  they  don't  want to  negotiate  with  us  they  hate  us  and  Al  you  got  to  think  is  playing  to  our  weaknesses  at  this  point  so  how  are  we  handling  that 
[00:48:00]  and  weaknesses  let me  tell you  something  that is  again  weaknesses  meaning  the  diversity  in the  military  and  what  what  the  voters  at  the  last  presidential  election  were  afraid  of  and  were  remember  the  fear  mongering  that  was  going  on  when  you  talked  to  the  left  and  the  Democrats  the  fear  mongering  that  the  right  conservatives  and  Republicans  were  spreading  around  that  oh  my  god  it's  going  to  weaken  our  stance  in  the  world  especially  with  terrorists  it  absolutely  has 
[00:48:30]  when you  have  a  president  that  will  not  criticize  these  motherfuckers  for doing  shit  like this  the only  thing  I like  is that  he said  he was  going to  close  Guantanamo  it's  still  running  I  believe  there's  a lot  of  things  that he  said  he  was  going  to  do  which  it  just  seems  like  behind  the  scenes  were  kind  of  fucking  well  if  you  do  that  for  whatever  reason  it  didn't  happen  I'll  give him  that  I  think  he  intended  on it  but  either  was  counseled  your  decision  is not  wise  or there  are  people  in the  intelligence  community  behind  the 
[00:49:00]  scenes  he  brought  that  up  before  he  was  elected  and  he  was  criticized  on  it  there  were  people  professionals  people  that  knew  the  situation  that  said  why  this  couldn't  and  he  only  listened  after  he  got  into  office  I  think  you  know  more  I  think  you  told  more  after  you  get  in  office  he  fucking  knew  there's  no way  you shut  that  place  down  and  just  let  these  guys  where  put  them  in  regular  prisons  send  them  to  their  home  countries  where  they  just  hailed  as  heroes  it  bullshit  you 
[00:49:30]  can't  shut  down  a  prison  like  Guantanamo  especially  with  the likes  of what's  happening  recently  also  the  Pan Am  bomber  getting  out  I  think  in a  way  I  think  is that  guy dead  yet  no he's still  alive  I thought  he just  recently  I'm not  sure  I think  he's  dead  I don't  remember hearing  that he  actually died  I didn't  either  I think  that would  have been  big news  he was  supposed to  die  within a  month  that month  has passed  I need to  find out  I think 
[00:50:00]  England  or Scotland  really in  a way  that kept  Guantanamo  because all  of a sudden  the outrage  over that  fucking  savage  being released  people being  sent home  from Guantanamo  it would be  seen as the  same thing  and if one  of them  fucking  did something  that killed  Americans  it would ruin  his presidency  this actually  wasn't the first  thing  I wanted to  bring up  Chicago Mayor  Daley  and his  blame game  that he's  doing  what is he  doing  well of course  he's blaming 
[00:50:30]  America's love  of guns  America's love  of guns  is being  blamed for  the terrorist  massacre  at Fort  Hood  because again  guns don't  vote  so you can  blame guns  it's a very  easy thing  to do  Daley  and other  politicians  like to  blame gun  violence  on the  guns  themselves  it's  easy  easier than  admitting  any  inconvenient  politically  incorrect  truths  that might  reveal 
[00:51:00]  where to  place the  blame  kids  murder  each  other  in the  inner  city  that's  because  of the  guns  that's  what he's  saying  and by  the way  let me  explain  something  to people  there are  I believe  two cities  in the  United States  of America  that under  no circumstances  allow  guns  one of them  is Chicago  where's the  other one  I believe  it's DC  but they're  passing laws  they're trying  to get  things done  over there  they actually  have a case  that's going  on  Chicago  which by  the way  has some 
[00:51:30]  of the  highest  gun  violence  and murder  rates  by guns  in the  country  so  how  how does  that figure  Mayor  Daley  how does  that figure  it doesn't  it doesn't  do you notice  when something  like this  happens  whether it's  gang violence  or this  guns are  attacked  but when it's  a white  right wing  extremist  nut  who does  snap and  kill people  guns are  attacked  but also  his ideology  is attacked  and the  obsession  he has  with his  ideology  a militia  like that 
[00:52:00]  it's not so much  the availability  of the guns  because everyone  knows  the militia  will have  the guns  but then  they attack  that ideology  that white  supremacist  here's this  guy  you'll never  hear that  with a  Muslim  attack  like this  Mayor Daley  not blaming  a jihadist  stop it  let's go to the  phones  we got some  great calls  coming in  I don't know  what your name  is sir  Jim  Anthony  that's Danny  hello this is  Sobe 
[00:52:30]  Sobe  yeah  Sobe  he's an  Arab American  which is  the worst  of this  phone call  what's up  I am the  Egyptian  magician  my name  is Sobe  I do  magic  no accent  to him  sorry  what's up  Sobe  I love you  I love you  guys  I really  hate that  the first  time I'm  calling  is actually  to disagree  with something  no  listen  the only  problem  I have  and I  actually  agree  with you  guys  on a lot  of things  but the 
[00:53:00]  only  problem  I have  is yesterday  I was  listening  on the  replay  and I  hear you  guys  kind of  saying  you know  hey  don't be  saying  all these  things  about  you know  toddling  the  the  you know  don't  don't hate  on all  Arabs  and don't  hate  on all  Muslims  listen  you have  to say  that  because  you guys  don't realize  there was  plenty of  violence  on Arab  Americans  after 9-11  they just  didn't show  it  you know  you don't  go around  after that  and show 
[00:53:30]  and make  people feel  bad  for people  no one  would feel  bad  after 9-11  if there  was a  real  outbreak  of violence  against  Arab  Americans  I remember  let me  explain  something  I remember  the stories  there was  a Sikh  that was  attacked  pulled out  of his  cab  and beaten  by people  that was  saying  you towel  head  and meanwhile  a Sikh  has nothing  to do  with that  religion  or terrorism  there was  plenty of  instances  if you look  back  you're kind  of forgetting 
[00:54:00]  about those  I remember  them  there were a lot  of beatings  that went on  and the news  the fucking  vultures  they are  they would  have loved  to have shown  stories like  that because  America at that  point wanted  to see some  type of  retribution  regardless of  what it was  people being  beaten in the  streets  we're fucking  animals  we kind of  wanted to  see that  so the news  wasn't sweeping  anything under  the carpet  but then if you  start showing  innocent people  getting beaten  people are going  to start feeling  bad for them  and then that's  not really 
[00:54:30]  I'm not saying  beat innocent  people  I'm not saying  that  and so  it's not even  that you're  wrong  they should  say  you have to  realize  when they're  saying  the initial  reaction  is what's  driving everybody  nuts  is don't  overreact  don't have  a backlash  instead of  addressing  what the  problem is  they automatically  are doing  a politically  correct damage  control  it's almost  like when a  black guy  mugs an old  lady  they don't  say don't  attack blacks  or when a  white man  fucking  commits a  hate crime  against a  black  they don't  say don't  beat up  white people 
[00:55:00]  it's like  they don't  do that  with other  groups  they do it  in this case  yeah  I've never  seen a  group  you said  it yesterday  it was your  point  they don't  do it  but they do  it with  Arabs  but that's  because the  main thing  about Arabs  is their  terrorist  it is because  that's how  they're perceived  they wouldn't  do it about  white people  I've never  seen a  group  I've never  seen a  religious group  handled with  kid gloves  more than  the Muslim  religion  just like 
[00:55:30]  we were  saying the  other day  I've never  seen in  this day  and age  a group  like  African  Americans  handled  the way  they're  handled  with  this  coddling  no jokes  can be  ever made  about them  if you  disagree  with the  president  you're a  racist  that's the  type of  shit  I hate  and as  far as  the Muslim  religion  goes  I've never  again  I've never  seen a  religion  handled  with  kid gloves  like the  Muslim  they will  not  fucking  the only  thing  again  Fox News  they will  get on 
[00:56:00]  and say  this guy  is a  fucking  Islamic  terrorist  he is  a  jihadist  he was  influenced  by  one of  these  imam  fucking  assholes  in a  mosque  he went  to  by a  website  he wrote  letters  trying to  get in  contact  with  Al Qaeda  he is a  homegrown  terrorist  who was  influenced  by  international  terrorism  and took  it out  on  American  soldiers  what's 
[00:56:30]  the  difference  between  that  and  a  terrorist  he is  an  Islamic  terrorist  no no  I  totally  agree  he is  an  Islamic  terrorist  but  hey  listen  Fox News  wanted  the  DC  sniper  to be  a  terrorist  so bad  they actually  were disappointed  when he was a black guy  I'm not fucking saying  Fox News is the be all  end all of news  my friend  they fuck up a lot  believe me  but you know  they're the only ones  that are  taking this at face value  they showed a shitload of clips  yesterday  I was watching Hannity 
[00:57:00]  and they showed some clips of  how CNN  and MSNBC  and everything was handling it  and it was this blame game  of  let's remember  this is an individual incident  of this  not once  mentioning terrorism  and Islam  they wouldn't fucking  put their hands on it  that's the point  it's not that all Arabs  are terrorists  it's this  blindness  to it when it exists  it's so out of balance  in the other direction  because they don't have a problem  talking about  right wing 
[00:57:30]  Christian fundamentalist ideologies  and again  they should shit on that  when a guy like that  bombs an abortion clinic  or McVeigh  they attack  the ideology  that caused him  to do that  these fucking media outlets  are so terrified  because they're not afraid  of Christian backlash  as far as violence  against them  the New York Times  would not show  the cartoon of Mohammed  that got the Danish  cartoonist death threats  because those fucking  pussies  were afraid  meanwhile they'll show  pissed Christ  they'll show anything  from any other religion  there were people 
[00:58:00]  that reporters  were quitting  because the fucking  New York press  I believe  or the village voice  wouldn't show the cartoon  whereas you're goddamn right  they would have  if it vilified Christianity  or Judaism  so there is a handling  of Islam differently  and that's what drives me  fucking crazy  no no  I do  I do realize  that it is that case  but at the same time  maybe  kind of  I don't want to be a hypocrite  and kind of say  maybe it should  but honestly  from my point of view  from where I'm sitting  I don't really hate it 
[00:58:30]  too much  there could be a backlash  out there  I'm really scared  I'm always scared  of things like that  you guys have no idea  no one hates terrorists  more than Arab Americans  they have nothing  look look look  let me say something  I mentioned this yesterday  that's a pretty good point  right there  I'm not saying  I like that point by Sobe  I'm not saying  that all Muslims  are terrorists  but what I am saying  is  I am saying  that most terrorists  against the United States  are Muslim 
[00:59:00]  there's a difference  between saying  all Muslims  are terrorists  and saying  all terrorists  are Muslim  it's like  everybody that attacks  this country  or at least  a very large percentage  based on  religious ideology  are  Islamic terrorists  and there's a difference  between that  and saying  that all Muslims  it's the same thing  as when you talk  about blacks  and you watch the news  and every time  you see a fucking  hold up 
[00:59:30]  or this and that  a large percentage  of the time  very disproportionately  to the percentage  of black people  in the society  it's usually  a black guy  holding up the store  doing this  drug dealers  bringing them in  I'm not saying  all black people  do that  but I'm saying  a disproportionate  number of blacks  are committing  these crimes  why does it have  to be lumped  into the same thing  you say one thing  that doesn't mean  I'm saying  all Muslims  are terrorists  but I am saying  that most of the  terrorism  is done by Muslims  I agree with you guys 
[01:00:00]  on that  what I'm saying is  I actually agree  that they really  should be mentioning  it more  they shouldn't be  such wusses about it  I know  but a lot of these  politicians  and stuff like that  like the army guy  I think the army guy  saying it  honestly  to be honest  with you  is in a way  trying to say  hey we don't want  Arabs to now  not join the military  because now you're  really scared  because they want  translators  they want guys 
[01:00:30]  like me to be  able to go in there  you know what I mean  help out a lot  and I think a lot of  Arab Americans  are like scared  and something like  that happens  how do you fix that  how do you fix that  problem  where you get  some guy  that starts  getting influenced  by radical Islam  and then  maybe changes  his mind  like this guy  again  like I was saying  earlier  he's an American  soldier  not a Muslim  American soldier  where when you're  sent to war  you know  there were  actually  there were 
[01:01:00]  Japanese soldiers  fighting  in the American  military  during World War II  there were German  soldiers fighting  during World War II  they didn't think  of themselves  as Japanese  Americans  and they couldn't  kill other  Japanese or Germans  so Muslims  this guy had it  in his head  that I cannot  in good conscience  go over there  and shoot other  Muslims  now that to me  is a giant  red flag  first of all 
[01:01:30]  but how do you  then sort that out  between other Muslims  or people that  join the military  and then find  religion in Islam  and decide  that they're gonna  do this  it's a very tough  situation  and this is what  you gotta understand too  it's a different case  with Islam  than other groups  because you say  like all Arabs  you don't want to be  perceived as  and of course  nobody would want that  because it is stupid  it's not realistic  but how do you  fix the problem  because what  Al-Qaeda has done  and look  maybe it's a brilliant  strategy  is they have attacked 
[01:02:00]  from within  as civilians  so it's almost like  we're taught  you know  when you look at the Germans  or the Japanese  or any other country  the Russians  it's always been a nation  a nation making a statement  and sending planes  this case  it is civilians  attacking civilians  or paramilitary people  who have immersed  themselves as civilians  we've been taught  that anybody you know  could be somebody  who is a potential attacker  and we've been taught that  by the guys who did it  so it's like  how do you  then all of a sudden  you need more outcry  and I'm not saying  there's none  from Muslims 
[01:02:30]  only because  the attackers  are fucking civilians  so it's like  you're taught  that the guy  who drove your kid  to school  that normal guy  who had a good career  all of a sudden  is flying a plane  into the building  and they're constantly  making arrests  from people  who are living  as civilians  not just here  but in Germany  and England  the neighbors  are always stunned  it's this just  how do you combat that  that's the key  it's like  how do you not look  at people  as potential  problems  when they have  kind of trained you  like this is how 
[01:03:00]  we're going to attack you  yeah they're not  on their patios  firing AK-47s  up in the air  in the middle  of any town USA  let me say  what do you think  man  that's I mean  that's a tough mission  I honestly  I honestly like  I mean for me  I have nothing to hide  so and I know  people kind of  you know  the government's  watching people  all the time  and stuff like that  so for me  if I join  if I join the military  and I almost signed on  to the National Guard  a little while ago  but if I join the military  I have no problem  with you know  them listening  and on conversations 
[01:03:30]  or emails  or whatever  because I'm not  going to have  anything to hide  so that I don't mind  it's the public  kind of look  that I would be getting  that's what scares me  you understand  what I'm saying  like if I have  that attitude  if that attitude  is not  you know  you kind of have  to do some damage  control  if you are a general  or whatever  because you can't  have them now  look at those soldiers  in a different way  and I'm not talking  about people in general  you guys are kind  of generalizing  I'm talking about  specifically other soldiers 
[01:04:00]  you don't want them  to start looking  at Arab Americans  or whatever  so they kind of  have to do this  this kind of  you know  damage control  but should they be  watching the Arab American  soldiers  absolutely  why not  you know what I mean  if you see that  this guy clearly  doesn't have any ties  whatever  you kind of  leave him alone  like that  that I don't mind  that I don't mind  it's just  generally publicly  saying it  definitely kind of  scares the crap out of me  so you're saying  in the public  like in the military  I mean look  you don't want  Arabic soldiers  attacked 
[01:04:30]  the president  saying the speech  or the general  saying the speech  something like that  they really have to  watch what they're saying  because it can have  a backlash  not everybody sits there  and looks at it  with an open mind  like you guys  not everybody's  that smart  there are plenty of  you know  knee jerk  reacting  go get them  kind of guys  and those are the guys  that get the crap out of me  yeah you want  look you want to  speak responsibly  right  I mean  of course you don't  want to just fire off  some dumb shit  I got two words  internment camp  oh shit  that's what I say  Toby where do you work 
[01:05:00]  hello  where do you work  I'm a flight instructor  I'm a chemist  I'm a chemist  oh no  oh shit  oh no  that's not good  oh shit  oh no  you are not a chemist  oh no  I nigh  I nigh  I nigh  I nigh  I nigh  yeah what are you  mixing up in that  lab of yours  where do you live  it's actually  it's actually like  precious metal stuff  it's a gold line  on Palladium  where do you live  I'm in  I'm in Jersey

[01:06:00]  stop it  we all know that right  there we go  alright so  there we go  thanks I'm a chemist  you motherfuckers  I wouldn't mind  hearing from more  Arab Americans  we just heard  from our entire  Arab listening audience  thank you so much  there can't be many  out there  can't piss him off  he's the only guy  that likes us  how about a few  more of you  call  let's go  let's go  let's go  ex-military  Tim in Maine  Tim  hey boys  how you doing  happy birthday  Jim  hi Tim  oh Jimmy  hey yeah  I was in the military  and I 
[01:06:30]  understand what you guys  are saying  happy veterans day  by the way  yeah today  to all the vets  out there  happy end  slash somber  veterans day  well thank you  we must remember  I'm a member  of the check  of the month  club now  I'm out now  oh yeah  but anyway  the general  was just doing  what he was told  to do  because  you know  the army  is almost  the government's  test bed  for all this stuff  I mean  desegregation  started in the  armies in the  50s with Truman  and all this 
[01:07:00]  other stuff  so it's nothing  new that they're  trying to be  diverse or anything  like that  when you get  into combat  then you're all  equally worthless  to me  yeah  and it isn't  even that  the diversity  of the military  of course  is great  dude  I want Arabs  in the military  I want blacks  and whites  and fucking  everyone in this  country I want  to be comfortable  joining  I want gays  in the military  anybody who wants  to fight for this  fucking country  I really want  to be able to  go and do it  but it was just  the fact that  that's one of the  more prominent  things he said  if we lose our  we're not going 
[01:07:30]  to lose our diversity  that's just an idiotic  it's a non-issue  this guy was a  fucking radical  we're not losing  diversity by looking  for radical Muslims  in the military  exactly  nobody wants  Muslims thrown  out of the military  nobody wants  Arabs thrown  out of the military  I want  maybe closer  attention paid  when there's  warning signs  to fucking  guys who are  emailing  a guy who was  the head of the mosque  that two 9-11 hijackers  were a part of  I'd like that  look at more seriously  someone brought up  a great point  on 
[01:08:00]  they didn't  yes  it was on  O'Reilly last night  that  if this was  during the Cold War  and there was  a soldier  that was sending  letters to Moscow  yes  on a daily basis  you would  damn well  look into  what the fuck  shenanigans  he was pulling  you think that  would have been  a problem  I think that  might have been  a problem  so you know  we are at war  with these people  no matter what  some people  don't like to  call it a war  it is a war 
[01:08:30]  and we're at war  with them  and you can't  be trying  to send  letters  to the enemy  that's a great  point though  man  in the Cold War  that's a great  fucking point  no shenanigans  and fucking  coddling back then  and no email  so the fact  that they were  emailing in the 80s  we would have been  like what is this  thing  what a great invention  it's magic  it's magical  there's no  negotiating either  like with past wars  you can negotiate  with the other side  eventually  and figure some shit out  yeah that is true  we're in one of those  weird situations  there's no negotiating 
[01:09:00]  with this one  we laughed  our asses off  at Russia  for going into  Afghanistan  because we knew  it was unwinnable  because we had just  gotten our ass beat  in the same situation  in Vietnam  and now we're there  thinking  oh fuck  how are you going  to stop these things  where there's no  real borders  there's tribal regions  and fucking areas  where this sect  lives and stuff  some hate us  more than others  there's no clear  cut enemy  which of course 
[01:09:30]  we've heard before  how do you  how do you fucking  fight that  the Russians  you know what  these the Afghan  fighters were doing  and this is when  people say  we armed  bin Laden  right  we did  he was fucking  fighting against  you know  our enemies  you ever have a  friend that all  of a sudden  isn't your friend  anymore  but I've heard  that happens  if I just disagree  with everything  no I never have  they're all my  friends from  town  I hate you  but it's uh  you know  I heard that the  Afghan fighters  were fucking  I mean they were  good fighters  man  they were like  they would open  the top of the  Russian tank  and drop 
[01:10:00]  fucking beehives  in the fucking  Russian tanks  and close it  and when the  fucking soldiers  how were they  handling the  beehive before  they dropped it  probably in bags  or whatever  I mean they  probably just had  them and then  fucking just  opened it in the  tank and then  when the soldiers  came out  they were just  shooting them  because bees  will make you  vacate a tank  how many times  do they do that  don't know  but I remember  hearing it  and going  the fucking  brilliance of that  that's a hell  of a strategy  taken out by a  beehive  yeah a whole  bunch of them  that's gotta suck  I know they're  like it's as  busy as the  inside of a  tank in here  it was a real 
[01:10:30]  inside of a  tank of activity  the inside of a  tank hairdo  stop me  I'm on a  beehive roll  oh you know  that's a good  point Tom in  Iowa I can't  go to you  any Arab chemist  that calls your  show should get  a prize so we  could get a  name and an  address  oh yeah we  should have  given us  something from  the prize  closet  yes we need  your address  good job Tom  can't get to  you right now  Jason what's up  buddy  no then how  are you guys  doing  alright man  bye  hey I was  wondering if you  guys caught the  60 minutes on  Sunday I've seen a  lot of these over  the last few years 
[01:11:00]  but was it on  bananas  what a good fruit  it comes in its  own wrapper  oh you meant the  other part  do you ever notice  when a guy with  receding hair shoots  his fellow soldiers and  nobody wants to  call it what it is  do you ever notice  that  go ahead buddy  what  no but basically  they were telling  about they're talking  about electronic  warfare and how  terrorists can basically  take down the whole  US through electronic  warfare and it just  drives me crazy  because they have  these specials all the  time where basically  they're telling you know  terrorists and other  people how they can  attack us where we're 
[01:11:30]  completely vulnerable  well you know what  we have hackers too  and that can be done  they keep breaking  into the pentagon  and all this stuff  but so far nothing  has really happened  to hurt the country  with that stuff  unless they have a  way of getting in  and getting secrets  and strategies  but the most horrible  thing I've seen so far  is I click on a link  that you know  it says hot chick  and it's meat spin  and if that's all  they're doing  so be  I've had just the  opposite problem  with that  someone is  questioning your 
[01:12:00]  brilliance with the  beehive thing  Brian Owen Chicago  writes brilliance  why didn't they  just drop a couple  of grenades in there  because if they're  opening the top  then they can just  pop a couple  what's fucking  cheaper  economics  yeah exactly  who wants to  waste grenades  on three guys  but you've got to  go around the  countryside collecting  beehives  these are  voluntary I'm sure  in that country  and let me also  say whose job is  that  what stupid  tank crew is  letting an Arab  with a beehive  walk up to him  Jesus Christ  shoot him  I'm calling  shenanigans  on the whole  beehive thing  I thought it  happened once  snopes it 
[01:12:30]  they would probably  just run up on  the fucking tank  and somehow  get in  yeah  somehow get in  hello  yes  hello  it is not a  Russian  want to come  in fight war  oh shit  it is bee guy  yeah what do you  think they walked  up with a fucking  beekeeper suit  they're like who  is this man  approaching the  tank  apparently he  needs punch  do you think  he wants a  piece of cheese  I need one of  these Afghanis to  get that god damn  hornet's nest out  of my brother's  what's he doing  with that  I got an idea 
[01:13:00]  drop it in the  sunroof of your  car  I want to start  a campaign  you know the  big hornet's nest  in my brother's  attic  I want Mike  Rowe to  personally remove  the hornet's nest  from my brother's  attic  that'd be a great  dirty job  he does dirty  jobs  not fucking  deadly jobs  fuck that  I want  how do we get  this started  I want to  start a campaign  I want Mike  Rowe to  personally help  my brother  god damn  that's a good  idea  that would be  good man  and his wife  my brother's wife  is in love  with Mike Rowe  which makes it  perfect  get a little  honey 
[01:13:30]  a little cuckolding  I think we should  all start tweeting  the shit out of that  I need Mike  Rowe to help  my brother out  dude that's a  fucking good idea  and we'll either  fucking film it  for some kind  of dirty job  episode or we'll  just film it  for YouTube  we'll do  something  come on Mike  Rowe help me  out we got to  get this hornet's  nest out of my  brother's attic  he probably even  know how to  do it already  yeah  he knows everything  but the problem  with the hornet's  nest you saw the  video I don't know  how you get to it  it's in the worst  spot because you  can't take it out  without cracking it  open is what it is 
[01:14:00]  right you can't  just scoop it up  you can't just  you can't even  cover it up really  well I'll tell you  again you have to  cut the roof I think  to get at it  you take a thick  clear plastic tarp  and it's in a  nook and corner  there but you  block off  it isn't a weird  thing though  there's joists  there  you staple  fucking  you staple down  all of this  tarp around it  where you can see  through it  where they can't  escape so if they  fly they're gonna  hit the tarp  you just surround  it with tarp  you gotta make  sure that you  got all the  holes covered  that's doable 
[01:14:30]  there's too many  fucking  there's floor  joists  this thing  kind of goes  over floor  joists  which are very  I don't know  if you get the  plastic to just  seal it that  easily  there's so many  nooks crannies  and angles  on that thing  imagine trying to  get plastic  yeah there's a  few there  oh my god  I love when my  brother pats this  damn thing  dude that looks  so fucking  otherworldly  I know it does  it doesn't look  like it belongs  on earth  no it's 
[01:15:00]  it's it's on  youtube opie radio  if you haven't  checked it out  but a lot of  people have  I want mike roe  to remove that  that's what I  say today  you're right  though you know  what that mike  roe's been lazy  lately let's give  him a real job  you gotta do it  you know what  you gotta do  he's gotta deal  with that nest  until december  when it's fucking  five degrees out  and he ought to  just not put the  heat on in the  house for a day  and just let it  get a little  colder  because that  that there's  not gonna do  anything  well that's the  other problem  is a lot of  people saying  but it's good  that's a warm  spot  you want to get  rid of that  beehive 
[01:15:30]  put your  businesses  back on a  paying basis  that's what you  need  fucking the  quint of  beehives  I talked to  my brother  yesterday  and unless we  can get mike  roe to do  this he's  seriously going  to wait until  it gets colder  and try to  scoop it up  no  by scooping it  up you're gonna  break it open  it's like  remember in stupid  faces of death  they show the  monkey head  sticking through  that's what it  looks like  it looks like  you'd be slicing  the head off the  monkey and the  entire brain  would be  you're not 
[01:16:00]  taking the  whole thing  well let's start  something on  twitter  i want mike roe to  help my brother  out and get rid of  this fucking  hornet's nest  is mike roe on  twitter  you know me  you know what i do  for a living  i'm mike roe  would you guys come  over in bee suits  for my video  without a fucking  doubt i'd go over  in a bee suit  i would need to  you'd be freaked  out right  absolutely sure it  is completely  sealed  yeah  like i will wrap  duct tape around  me like a  fucking maniac  the video camera  did not pick it up 
[01:16:30]  because i was using  the hd flip but  when my brother  patted this thing  you heard a  massive like  get a stethoscope  coming from inside  get a stethoscope  put it against it  and then put the  ear things by the  microphone  oh you'd get  Mike roe's a friend  of the show  he'll come over  and do this  we ought to get  steve to contact  we have his  contact  let's do it  yeah let's contact  mike roe immediately  if we get him on  the phone to even  talk about it  that would be nice  we need a giant  fucking beehive  someone is saying  that mike roe  already did that 
[01:17:00]  on dirty job  but he didn't do  it for my brother  well yeah  and my brother's  wife who's in  love with mike roe  and the horse nest  is literally like  right behind the  door of my nephew's  room  how does he sleep  how the fuck  does your nephew  sleep  does he sleep  knowing there's  monsters in the  closet  literally  kids are afraid  of monsters  in the closet  that's fucking  a monster  and you remember  being a kid  any little weird  thing in your head  would just  fucking be  real scary  I would picture 
[01:17:30]  the bees coming  from under the door  like the bugs  came out of  Mr. Pratt's mouth  and chest  and creep show  just fucking  pouring out  just pouring out  from underneath  the door  uncontrollably  what a great  fucking horror movie  that would be  but my nephew  said that he  sees one in his  room every once  in a while  so they're  kind of moving  around  they're coming  out  checking things  out  they probably walk  through a vent  once in a while  wake up and  one's crawling  in your ear  freak out  on your dickhead  and it stings  the hole  that's hot  imagine that  bees sting  on your dick 
[01:18:00]  hole  and you're in  the middle  of a conversation  so you can't  swat it right  then  I think you  could end  the conversation  is it amazing  how a bee  landing on you  there's nothing  that would take  priority  if a fucking  hornet lands  on you  I don't care  what you're  holding  you're fucking  dropping it  yeah  well I've done  that so many  times  and been in  like conversations  serious conversations  important conversations  and just then go  you flail  you just lose your mind  I'm a pussy  would be  I hate him  Joe  everyone has 
[01:18:30]  their idea  how to get rid  of this fucking  hornet  what does Joe  say  lasso them  but what if  your idea  doesn't work  and these things  come flying out  yeah you got  one shot at this  go ahead Joe  yeah isn't there  some kind of  a bug bomb  you could throw  in there  you know  like a poisonous  gas  yeah but  Anthony raised  the point  is that  it's over  these things  where they may  just be able  to go into  the nest  may actually  be in  there's a lot  of the nests  you can't see  so they may  just hide in there  we don't know  how big the nest  is  and it's not  just sitting  on a one flat 
[01:19:00]  surface  it's in a corner  where it's actually  on the  the floor  the ceiling joists  of the attic  and the roof  you put the top  on the bug bomb  and throw it in there  it's like a grenade  and it smokes up  the hole  oh really  we gotta cut the top  open  how's it gonna get  into the nest  no you don't  cut the top  open  you let it  seep through the nest  it also kills  our escape room  the same way  the hornets  breathe  the nest has holes  in it  yeah but it's got  holes to the outside  like that's how  they get in and out  and this nest  these little fuckers 
[01:19:30]  decided to build  their nest  around this huge  heavy plastic bag  they knew they were  gonna build a huge nest  they attach to like  everything  it's like a tuma  I say your brother  covers himself with honey  and runs up there naked  I do think that you have  to cover it up  with a tarp  I think  and then you can get  something to slowly  let smoke go in there  and you do it slow  from the outside  and then you fucking  inject the nest  or something  and just blast  the poison  well Jeff's got  today's idea  in the winter  would you do this  Jeff go ahead 
[01:20:00]  oh yeah  morning guys  happy birthday Jimmy  I'd get a couple of  CO2 fire extinguishers  and get it from  each side  and freeze it  with them  what is it  the blob  in his fucking attic  you dummy  Jimmy's always  Jimmy what if it  doesn't work  these things  as soon as they know  they're being attacked  trust me  they get very angry  and they figure out  what the hell's  going on  you know what  immediately  a CO2 fucking  fire extinguisher  what's the temperature  of the stuff  that comes out  that might fucking  last long enough  what if it doesn't 
[01:20:30]  I don't like the  might part of that  statement  wrap the hive  in dry ice  yeah  a dry ice  might work  if you  if you take  some dry ice  put it  how would you get it  to sit over  the entire surface  of it  I don't know  you don't need to  okay  no  wait wait  Wes has a little  info on this  go ahead Wes  yeah  hey guys  listen  it's just  three pieces  you put  one on each side  one on top  put a piece of  plastic over it 
[01:21:00]  that thing will  freeze in six to eight  hours  you just come back  pick it up  take it away  the only thing is though  because it's not  you don't know  what  how many nooks  and crannies  they're in  the bees  the nest may go  say the nest  extends out  two feet on either  side  what you just  can't see  like say  me  what  me  what  they're not going to  feel  it's not going to be  a sudden  thrash to them  what it's going to be  is just a steady  steady freeze  it's going to be  a steady cold  a slow freeze  you know this guy  might have a good idea  dude  you box  you like  block off 
[01:21:30]  the perimeter  of it  with like  a cardboard  or something  right  you tape the cardboard  down  and then you just  fill that up  with dry ice  so it covers  the fucking hive  with dry ice  now you cover that  with plastic  so it keeps the cold  then that fucking  thing will be  frozen  solid  how do we get  the dry ice out  you know you let  it melt  and it doesn't  get wet  it just melts  into a gas  I like that  well  good idea  me and my brother  we're discussing  we want to see  how active the hive 
[01:22:00]  is so we're  going to be  filming a video  in the very near future  cold six  says here's an idea  hire a professional  I told you  my brother can't  afford a professional  how much is a professional  so I guess  I gotta hire a professional  but we want to see  how active  introduce Islamic bees  into the hive  it's funny  someone wrote  I don't know  oh Blue Healer  Blue Healer writes  oh just have  Sobey suicide bomb  so he can claim  his 72 virgins  how fun would  just fucking  putting an M80 
[01:22:30]  on top of it be  oh  boom  blow a huge hole  in it and  aggravate the  fucking survivors  they would be so annoyed  oh the noise  oh their hard work  oh yeah  we're going to  aggravate the hive  in the next few days  to see you know  what kind of action  is inside  yeah  and I'm going to  put some cameras  down and see  action  that's a good idea  yeah you want to  light it up  and fucking  then we'll see  what we're dealing  with you know  oh yeah  why don't you  just be one big bee  oh Christ  imagine a giant  fucking wasp in there 
[01:23:00]  how scary is that  very  I'm frightened  but I think  Mike Rowe  you think Mike Rowe  would come  all the way out  to take care of this  it's not one of those  things where I'm like  there's no fucking way  you can get him to do that  I think you might be  able to get him  it's good publicity for him  not that he needs it  with all the commercials  he's doing  but  if not you could  probably get Rogan  to fucking kick it  yeah  I'll hire Pat from  Monaki  yeah it'll go from  Joe Rogan down to  Pat from Monaki  here Pat  I'll eat it  how much to remove  the hornet's nest  Pat  $75  that's fair 
[01:23:30]  well let's just  call it  even $50  just give me  a free appetizer  FH will do it for you  I have no economic  common sense  hey guys  just pay me what the  gas cost me to get  halfway to your house  I have no business  sense whatsoever  Drew Boogie's like that  too  like I'm doing  I'm working on a CD  with a small material  and I'm using Drew  to do some of the  he's very good  sure  and I'm like  I'm like I put it on  hold for a while  and now I started  again  I'm like Drew  I gotta pay you 
[01:24:00]  and he has no business  sense  he's like I don't know  I'm like Drew  it's okay  I don't mind  pick a price  are you out of your mind  watch him  yeah watch him  really fucking  hold me up  gonna motherfuck you  $15,000 shit bird  motherfucking me  but true  oh sandwich  alright well we'll  I mean the phones  are lit again  about the hornet's nest  I gotta figure this shit out  yeah  cause he's got  four small kids  in that damn house  yeah the  Environmental Protection Agency  loves this one Mark  dump motor oil  on it  and that way 
[01:24:30]  it'll seep through  the fucking sheetrock  and go into  the fucking  room downstairs  ass  yeah I'm gonna  definitely  irritate the nest  and have a camera rolling  put gas on it  I gotta freaking  make sure the family's  out of the house  when I do that one  but yeah  pour gas on it  just burn the house down  that's good  decon foregone  decon foregone  gonna be great  we're gonna exterminate  wait Brian has something  he's an exterminator 
[01:25:00]  we haven't heard  from one exterminator  about this  yeah really  Brian what do you got  hey what's up  bite  hey  um  I  the way I would  take care of it  is I take a drill  and drill a hole  through the wall  like in the room  or the ceiling  wherever it's touching  and then just puff  an apicite dust  into it  into the nest  a what  well it's a dust  it's an insecticide dust  kind of like baby powder  only it's specifically  made to kill bees  how does it get into  all the little compartments  there are so many 
[01:25:30]  fucking compartments  in that  yeah I know  but dust travels  like big time  yeah but it's gotta  travel a huge time  you don't really notice it  cause it's really small  but like when wind  catches it  it travels everywhere  yeah  how do you know  I mean a bee expert would know  but how do you know  where the nest  like is the nest contained  in what you can see  or does it go  like say it goes  into the insulation  how do you know  that the nest  doesn't have fucking  I actually saw this on  you'd see some  you'd see some staining  on the wall  because inside  all the larva  and bee excrement 
[01:26:00]  and things like that  it's gonna stain  you imagine stepping  in bee duty  in your own house  about throwing  a fumigant up there  like a flea bomb  or something  yeah  it's against the law  and you'd get  in some huge trouble  if like  someone got sick  or the fire alarm  went off  or something  yeah  what Danny  would you say  you could also  see where the hive  is using a  like a thermometer  because you could  see if the temperature  in the wall  has risen a couple  of degrees  from activity  inside the hive  oh Jesus 
[01:26:30]  actually so  I think they did that  on Dirty Jobs also  they saw how  a beehive was like  like six feet long  because they were  measuring the temperature  along the wall  they knew where to cut out  yeah that's what  I'm starting to wonder  if this thing  is in the wall  as well  yeah it could be  we can't really tell  dude if it goes down  oh my god  could it be bigger  this thing  around the plate  I'm trying to think  it could go down  the wall  into like the  drop ceiling  well it's usually  a plate  well another  another approach  to do is just  I mean I know 
[01:27:00]  there's  alright guys  I know there's  you know  bad feelings and all  but you could have  Jill Nicolini  ink it  ink it  ink it  Jesus  thanks Brian  Jesus  fucking thanks Brian  alright well that's  where we're at with  the fucking  hornet's nest  yeah  it's still there  it's amazing how  fucking bee chatter  look at the phones  I know  nobody doesn't want  to talk about bees  they want to talk  about  everyone loves  talking about bees  they want to talk  about homegrown  terrorism and  fucking bees  and bees 
[01:27:30]  that seems to be it  that's the buzz  oh Jimmy  I'm sweet  use nitrogen  nitrogen  liquid nitrogen  the biggest problem  is it's really hard  to get at  yeah  so you could cause  a problem  very easily  it's in a horrible  spot  look at the video  it's in a bad spot  it's fastened  to so many different  angles  and things  and you don't know  how deep it goes  it could go into  the wall  it could go  through one of the 
[01:28:00]  eaves  maybe my brother  had to like  you know  crawl down  and then  squeeze in  this one part  to just look at it  it's going to be  really hard to get it  just sit back  where you crawled  into that crawl space  and just start  blasting it with a  shotgun over and over  there's a video  just have him go  keep giving me  keep giving me  shells  bam bam bam  just blast it  someone video  response to my  video  and they did  just that  they blasted  with a fucking  shotgun  they get angry  the video  could have been  better  but this guy  took out a  hornet's nest  with a shotgun  it's pretty cool  you are not 
[01:28:30]  going to kill  them all  though  that's for sure  no  I think even  the guy's like  oh boy  angry  yeah no shit  so  hornets look  we hate them  but that takes  them a long  time to build  a giant nest  and all of a sudden  to have someone  just throw a rock  through it  imagine if you  had to just  puke your house  up  that's how  you built it  just by throwing  up and building  a house out  of your vomit  you're all  fighting to fuck  one queen  your whole life  is worth to  vomit and get  one load off  you'd be angry  if some idiot  came over and  kicked your vomit  house over 
[01:29:00]  your fucking  roof is gone  you're like  oh boy  this sucks  hey  opie  yeah  millionaire opie  quit being so  god damn cheap  and give your  brother a grand  so he doesn't  want to find  his kid  Mikey  how long have  you been  listening to this  show  that's the easy  way out  why would you  sacrifice such  entertainment  thank you anthony  in the end  i'm sure i'll be  paying for the  removal of the  nest but why  not make some  good radio out  of it is what  i'm thinking  of course i'm  paying for this 
[01:29:30]  thing  how much do you  think it would  cost to get that  done  i don't fucking  know  i would say  twenty eight  dollars  i swear it  would have to  be a couple  of grand  fuck  in that situation  where it's located  because i'm sure  it all comes into  play they don't  just go oh you  got a wise  problem here's  the price  they'd look at  that and go  that is in a  horrid spot  i got an idea  pat for munaki  if you could get  this nest out of  my brother's attic  i will give you  one thousand  dollars cash  he's gonna be  dead 
[01:30:00]  one thousand  dollars cash  that's right  if you do it  with your fist  five thousand  dollars cash  if you if you  want the job  you give me a  call  you're gonna have  to sign your  life away but  i would just  get in a b-suit  that is so  airtight  and then just  kick it  time and time  again leave  and go where's  my money  it's gone  it's gone  you didn't say  anything about  the hornets  derrick jeter  and to share  one golden  gloves  yes golden  gloves

[01:31:00]  dance with the  stars in front of  kelly osborne  how'd that go  sharon's uh  daughter i don't  know i didn't  watch i didn't  how the fuck  would i watch  that we'll get  into it next  though opie and  anthony stay  there  all right before  we move on one  more about the  bees i promise  last phone call  then we're going  to move into the  uh boil gate  thing we got lee  in philly lee  what's going on  buddy  uh nothing much  hey i'm a farmer  my wife's a  professional beekeeper  and farmers are as 
[01:31:30]  well okay the first  thing first thing you  got to do is figure  out whether or not  they're bees wasps  or hornets so you  can look at them if  if anybody's got one  of the little  fuckers you gotta  look between their  legs well no no  no no yeah that's  how you look and  see uh for the uh  the bee balls  hot balls uh no  seriously a bee is  brown dark brown with  tan stripes on it  no my brother my  brother knows a  little bit about  everything i'm pretty  convinced that it is  uh hornets okay well 
[01:32:00]  so there's nothing you  can do for hornets  except put a bug bomb  in there but if it's  bees you can get rid  of them for free and  people will be  grateful to get them  what you do is check  out the local  beekeepers association  and they have what  they call a swarm list  at the 800 number you  call them a professional  beekeeper will come out  and take them away and  put them in a hive for  you but if it's a  wasp or a hornet  fuck them just put a  bug bomb in there get  their family out of  those aren't honeybees  that's not honeybees  man this is this is 
[01:32:30]  uh fucking it comes  from another world this  nest yeah  but if you say it's on a  like a plastic bag that  often sounds a lot like a  bee nest that's what they  do uh but i can tell you  that the beekeepers get  really pissed off when they  get called in for a  hornet okay i think it's  hornets though  fuck bam okay all right  thank you  that's enough about the  uh the hornet's nest  enough about the bee  for today anyway  i'm gonna try to get  my throat to remove it 
[01:33:00]  when it breaks open and  spills out it's deadly  cargo  all right here we go  imagine you come home  one time the bees are  watching television they've  just taken over the house  get out there's all your  furnitures and the lawn  there's all bee things  little teeny seats  susan boyle  what happened with her  this fucking thing has  legs huh  who's susan he does  yeah four of them  beast uh the  entertainment show's all  over it for the third  day getting a lot of  exposure for the uh 
[01:33:30]  radio show there  nice  and now one person  around here acknowledging  it it's so bizarre i  know this is a worldwide  story you think one  person here at sirius xm  would acknowledge that  we just got huge  attention for the company  and our radio show  or the motherfucker who  inspired the whole thing  damn  what happened what  was that  i think it's fucking  fizzy's booger  what  i didn't eat it  eat it  what just happened  you grabbed a pen  no i fucking put my

[01:53:30]  we all laugh  and laugh  and laugh  and now the  world  literally the  world is talking  about it  the world  I'm not joking  the planet  earth  is talking  about it  if you look  at the stats  on the video  it's like  it's one of  the most viewed  in all these  fucking countries  around the world  I saw comments  like  it's the world  we did more  marketing with  one lousy video  than this  Sirius XM  has done for us  remember when  we came here  they were like  you guys aren't  marketed  and we will  change that 
[01:54:00]  let me tell you  what XM  wasn't doing  for you  and we'll do  we're going to  do everything  right for you  shut up  nothing has  changed  who are you  kidding  we're still  marketing ourselves  and doing a  pretty good job  at it  yes  so Inside Edition  was all over it  again Anthony  and Jimmy  playing the clip  and commenting  because I guess  Susan Boyle was 
[01:54:30]  booked to do  Dance with the Stars  and Kelly Osbourne  is still on the show  and Sharon usually  sits on the front row  so they're like  oh boy  they're going to be  face to face  for the first time  since the controversy  Kelly didn't get  the boot did she  I don't know  I used to watch  the show  when Chuck Liddell  was on  and then when he  he got  smiling Chuck Liddell  what a great line  that's a great line  do you love  Susan Boyle  I mean do you  know she helped  the show or not  Jimmy started  oh I'm happy  that she  I like everybody 
[01:55:00]  to do well  even someone  that looks like  a slapdoll  I don't know  why they tried  to clean her up  I mean  that is fantastic  it's kind of  hard to spin that  what did you mean  when you said  she was a hairy  asshole face  I didn't mean it  to be taken  in a bad way 
[01:55:30]  and she is  a lovely  I would hope so  followed by God  bless her  you just want to  say God bless  and here's a  Gillette razor  I never noticed  that she had  facial hair  oh my god  I couldn't get past  the slapdoll  I couldn't get past  the fucking  G Wilder wig  God bless her  God bless her  but we love her  yeah  but she's terrific 
[01:56:00]  at a price  God doesn't  give everyone  everything  absolutely  yeah  but he gave her  the talent  he certainly did  yes  yes  he did  really short  changed it on the  rest of it  he gave her with the  fucking ugly  and the fucking  ugly stick  he certainly did  holy Jesus  are you holding back  God  God damn  Sharon I need you  to open up  you gotta open up  a little bit  you gave Tiger  what the ugly stick  wow that is very 
[01:56:30]  refreshing  absolutely  she was just  having a fucking  good time  she was being funny  we were all laughing  fucking idiots  so anyway  inside edition  it was day three  tries to talk to  Kelly Osbourne  about what her  mother said  now they're hunting  now they're hunting  Kelly Osbourne  why  let's see how it  went down on the  entertainment show  Kelly Osbourne  is one of the  final five  on Dancing with the 
[01:57:00]  Stars  but will there be  an awkward moment  for her on  tonight's show  Susan Boyle  is the special  guest  Kelly's mother  Sharon  just blasted  the singing  sensation  in a radio  interview  Kelly's staying  mum on the  controversy  I'm not talking  about that  but she does  call Boyle  an inspiration  and says she's  looking forward  to seeing her  performance  what I find so  sweet about it  is you can tell  that no matter  what she still  really wants to  do it  everything's got 
[01:57:30]  in with a  stinger  and start  with a stinger  this thing is so  awful they got to  make sure they do  something on it  every night  right  every night  and then Access  Hollywood  with Billy Bush  you know your  mother made this  statement to  Susan Boyle  Kelly Osbourne's  I roll to  LaToya  don't you think  Maria says it  all  it's a TGIF  fact  following last  night's Dancing  with the Stars  Kelly says she  supports her mom  following Sharon's  mean-spirited  cracks about 
[01:58:00]  Susan Boyle  on Sirius XM's  The Opie and  Anthony Show  but Kelly  appeared to have  some misgiving  it's just one of  those things  you know  she's my mom  and I have her  back no matter  what  God  everyone's just  talking about it  well why are they  asking Kelly about  something her mother  said nothing to do  with Kelly  these fucking  scumbags  just want to  keep it going  they are mad  Sharon said it  and they can't  stop playing it  because they know 
[01:58:30]  it's great  God  they know it's  great stuff  at least we play  stuff and laugh  about it and go  oh this is great  let's milk this one  yeah  that's what they're  doing milking it  but they won't  admit that  there's such shit  if it was so  horrible the best  thing they could do  is just let it go  away  and here's  Susan Boyle  performing on  Dancing with the  Stars  because you know  she sings like  an angel  she sure does  she really sings  like an angel  welcome back to  Dancing with the  Stars  our next guest  is a Scottish  singing sensation  who created a

[02:01:00]  nigh  when I  was young  and  unafraid  I've come  over for  first class  fucking  alpha  and some  slop  I need  some slop  before I  go on  the show  cause I'm  a peg  some slop  from the  slug  and wine  and  disted  for the

[02:03:30]  Is it all that your album is called dream a dream  Yet you're every man's fucking nightmare  I see some fucking irony in that  You're a peg  They should have had her perform in chains 
[02:04:00]  Oh shit  Now don't worry  Those chains are made of way tensile steel  She can't break them  Do take a picture  You're gonna annoy her  She'll break them  She'll eat the Empire State Building  See she's as big as King Kong  That's the chick  Get us some  That's my chick  Get us some  British milk you fucking cow  They should have had the dancers perform on her back 
[02:04:30]  Oh fuck  I'm very happy for her  Whatever man  Oh is that her album right there?  What do we got?  A dream to a tree  She does Creeping Death?

[02:07:00]  How sweet the song  She stays on key very good  But it's so dull  This is ponderous  Every song is like that  There's an audience for this unfortunately  But now you're found 
[02:07:30]  We're at the fucking restaurant  I bet  Put on Silent Night  I'm sure Silent Night  Was the time she said  Who wants to fuck me tonight  Or what happened after she  Fucked a night  And rolled over on it  Can we do a duet  Ziggy doing Silent Night  With Susan Boyle  Oh wow  Can we work on that real fast  Maybe in production  You might have to get a  Yeah time it right  She's on  On the album cover 
[02:08:00]  She's like  It's kind of a black and white shot  And she's holding her face  Yeah  Like a 1991 comedian head shot  But it's to hide the fucking  Blabar  Big jowls  Yeah it makes her face  Look a lot thinner  Exactly  Because the hands are covering up  A lot of chin  She's also next to three oak trees  Which makes her face  Look slightly thinner  Not much  I wonder how many people  Were listening to Tony Orlando  And went and tied a ribbon  Around her face  That was yellow by accident  I had to say sorry ma'am  We're an old oak tree 
[02:08:30]  Dan very confused  Dan the trucker  You seem confused  What do you got  What's the matter  I'm not confused  Is this Peter Doyle  Singing Put on the Ritz  Peter Doyle  No it's Susan Boyle  Let's go to Roach  Roach  Well first off  I completely understand  Why you're doing this  But you're saying that  You don't understand  Why they won't let it die  But you keep doing it  Over and over again  No see we understand  We understand  We're  This is good radio for us 
[02:09:00]  We completely understand  And  And they  And what they're  Not being honest about  They're continuing the stories  About Susan Boyle  And Sharon Osbourne  Because it's really good  TV for their purposes  And they're not  They're not helping  Susan Boyle  Right  By playing the clip  Night after night  After night  That's the difference  My friend  Right  I think she should  Really sing  Her next song  Should be  Goodbye Horses  What do you mean  Boo

[02:16:30]  Thanks for that  One in there  You can give  Your heart to Jesus  But your fat  Belongs to  Susan Boyle  You think they're  Going to play this  On Access Hollywood  I don't think so  No I don't think so  I wish they would  Do it in person  For them  Susan Boyle  032  Eating  Congratulations  You made it  She was singing  Congratulations  Private Boyle  We finally found  Something you  Do well  Because you 
[02:17:00]  Dreamed a dream  Private Boyle  Is not a  Disgrace herself  Jefferson is  Killing today  Yeah  I think that was  The name  I don't remember  I think it is  Let's take a break  Cool man  And we'll do  Something different  Yes  What a show so far 
[02:17:30]  Fuck  I'm having fun  Hurts from laughing  We got Dr. Aaron Carroll  In studio  How are you sir  I'm good  How are you  Now some people  Might be going  Who  Because we have  A lot of doctors  On the program  Well we were supposed  To like have a nice  Debate between him  And you  Last time you came in  About health care  Remember all that  You had the worst  Timing though  Because Anthony  Went off  Like the two hours  Before you got here  On Obama  And health care  And all this stuff  And then you come in  And you know  Anthony already  Fought the fight  So he just kind of 
[02:18:00]  Let you  You know  And the odd thing  Now that I know more  I'm totally behind  This new health care thing  Are you really  Fuck no  Shut up  You're shocking me  Terribly  You're doing Dr. Oz today  Yeah  They're taping  Later this afternoon  What are you doing for him  He's doing some stuff  On medical myths  Which is more of the books  Medical myths  And that's the book you wrote  Exactly  I like that book  It's on my toilet  Really  It's a good toilet book  You're shocked  How often that's where  People put it  I'm not even kidding  It's a good toilet book  It's called  Don't Swallow Your Gum  Don't Swallow Your Gum  There are certain 
[02:18:30]  Gum people  Stop it  It's okay to swallow  The other stuff  You keep making the mistake  No one else is making the mistake  You're weird elf  Teasing of course  Books like that are great though  In the bathroom  Because it's not like a novel  Where you have to sit there  And you read a few items  And then you move on  Wait until the next time  You're gurgling  See I'm a quick shitter  So it's perfect  Me too  The chapter's like  I think two pages  I'm good for two pages  When I'm taking dumps  Now the title itself  Don't Swallow Your Gum  Big medical myth 
[02:19:00]  Or is it fact?  No  It's total myth  The body's incredibly good  At getting things  From one end to the other  Yeah  Anything you swallow  Even if it's not digestible  And there's lots of stuff  If it's not digestible  It goes right through you  Let me explain something too  I think Don't Swallow Your Gum  You know that's  Maybe it's a myth  But that it won't  Screw you up  Or stay inside you  Because there's some things  That say it's stored inside you  And it never leaves  And blah blah blah  But I will say one thing  I remember I swallowed my gum once 
[02:19:30]  As a young teen  And it got caught in my ass hair  On the way out  Yes  What a fucking swarthy  How much fucking hair  You got back to hair  I'm not talking like  I'm not saying  You know  There's hair enough  To ponytail back there  But I'm a guy  Most guys have hair  Back there  And it did  A stick in my hair  What did you wipe  With glue traps  I swear to you 
[02:20:00]  I've talked about this book  So many times  That is the first time  Anyone's ever come up  With a legitimate thing  That actually makes me  Think about  My god  Thank you  Yes  Of course they've done  No studies on that  You need an agentum  That seems like  A legitimate problem  For people that might  Be swallowing gum  Yeah because it  Kind of comes out  You know there isn't  Much to break down  I guess  Do the stomach acids  Break down gum  No stomach acids  Won't  It's pretty much  Inadjustable  But still it should  Be surrounded by shit  I mean it's not like  Yes but it wasn't  Encased 
[02:20:30]  I think it was  One of those things  You ever see like  If you eat sausage  And peppers  Sometimes a pepper  Is just right on the  Outside  Sort of like  Like a chocolate chip cookie  Yeah  Or like fucking  Pinstriping  But you would think  It would still be  Covered by mucus  Or something  That it still not  Came through  And still was just  Sticky  Maybe  I had to break off  Midway  Sometimes you gotta do that  And it's just a wreck  Anyway  Maybe if you wiped it  Into the hair  Or something like that  Regardless of how it  Happened  It happened 
[02:21:00]  How did you get rid of it  And it was  I just kind of  Sat there for a while  Like tugging  With the  With the toity paper  And kind of  Pulling it out  It hurt  It was like  Plucking  The old remedies  Of putting ice on it  To freeze it off  Yeah  Freezing  Try some peanut butter  And then get your dog  In there  Yeah that was  So when I read that  I was like  Wow that's a myth  But I did have a problem  Usually people are thinking  About it getting stuck  In your stomach  For seven years  You're the first person  I've met  That's worried about it  Getting stuck  In the ass here 
[02:21:30]  Thank you  Give me a few more  From this book  Some good ones though  You know  The one that blows  That still disturbs me  The most coming up  On Thanksgiving  Is that turkey makes you sleepy  Ah yes  Everybody  Totally not true  They talk about the  Tryptophan  Tryptophan in it  And it makes you sleepy  See everybody knows that  But why are we all sleepy  First of all  Turkey doesn't have  A lot of tryptophan  It has no more tryptophan  Than like chicken or ground beef  And it has less  Than cheese or pork products  So but the ham and cheese sandwich  Nobody would ever say  Make you sleepy  I fall asleep mid bite  When I eat cheese  Even more shagging though 
[02:22:00]  If you buy tryptophan  As a sleep bait  It says on the side of the box  You have to take it  On an empty stomach  Because tryptophan  Is incredibly poorly absorbed  With food  So getting tryptophan  In turkey  In a huge meal  Would be the worst way  To try to get tryptophan  To get you to go to sleep  Why have they been saying this  For all these years  Because probably  First of all  If you eat a huge meal  You might get sleepy  And if you drink a lot  You might get sleepy  Both of which are likely  To occur on Thanksgiving  And they just decided  It had to be the turkey  It never sits there  It just gets invented 
[02:22:30]  It's crazy  Yeah they call it  Like a food coma  You sit there  You ate a lot  And then you plop down  On the couch or something  And you're just kind of  All full of food  That I think  But the thing is  Now with Thanksgiving  Coming up  There's got to be  One idiot  That has to mention it  Every time  You know the trip to phantom  And you're like  Now I'm going to have to go  Excuse me  You're wrong  And then it's going to be  A big argument  And be a problem  But it'll be  It'll be on every show  Every newscast  I'll mention  Every magazine 
[02:23:00]  I'll have it  It'll be on comedy  It is known now  As fact  Yes  Which is why I think  That was the one  I think that totally  Disturbed me the most  When I actually found  That wasn't true  I don't want to say  It blew my mind  But it's just  Well yeah calm down  It disturbed me  Well because  You just know  It's true  Yeah  And so when you find out  That it's not  It's sort of  Like Santa  What else isn't true  I want to move on  Where are you at  With the healthcare thing  Man  You know what  This is  I might agree  I think it's a mess too  But I think we probably  Think it's a mess  For different reasons  Anthony blames blacks 
[02:23:30]  I don't  Obviously  No I think  It's very partisan  The politics  That they're playing  Back and forth  Now it's just  A complete wreck  There's compromises  Being put in  There's things  That are being put  Into the bill  That have nothing  To do with healthcare  Oh that old gag  See this is where  I think we're going  To disagree  Because I think  The reasons that  You don't like it  Probably aren't  Aren't really  As problematic  As they probably are  I think that the  Reasons I don't like it  Are completely different  But why 
[02:24:00]  What are the things  You think that are  In there that are wrong  Well I don't like  The fact that  It's going to cost  Me more money  As a taxpayer  Up in the upper echelon  Of the tax bracket  Which I'm already  By the way  Feeling the effects  Of the Obama administration  And again  The Democrats  Here in New York  And I now pay  A MTA commuter tax  That I drive in  I fucking drive in  I pay street taxes  I pay tolls  To get into the city  I pay for parking  I pay for everything 
[02:24:30]  So why the hell  Am I paying for the trains  But I digress  I think honestly  First of all  You're one of the few  People I'd probably  Speak to  That with the house  Bill would actually  See an increase in tax  Yes  I give you that  The cost of this  Health care  Bill is crazy  But the senate bill  I bet  If the senate bill's  Way of paying for it  The excise tax  On high cost insurance  I will bet  Solid money  That the insurance  You get from  Sirius XM  Is not going  To qualify for that  Wait wait  Insurance from Sirius XM  What?  No  Hello?  No  No I don't get insurance 
[02:25:00]  But I will bet  Still that your  Health insurance  Probably doesn't cost  As much  As the really  Really high ones  Yeah well  I'm a business  Right  I'm incorporated  I run a business  I have health care  For my business  Right  And yeah  It's whatever  It costs  It's a lot of money  I don't deny that  But the tax  The health insurance  They're going to tax  In the senate finance bill  Is incredibly expensive insurance  And it's very likely  That insurance  Will start coming down  To be below that cap  So I will 
[02:25:30]  I bet there's a good chance  You won't actually  Have to pay that tax  Are you going to be able  To keep your own insurance  Under this bill  Did you read all fucking  Six feet of papers  Yes  Actually I'm one of the few  People that has  So again it depends  On what kind of insurance  You have now  Is your insurance  It depends  What if I  What if  Fuck it  What if I enjoy  The insurance I have  What if I like  The insurance I have  The insurance you have  My insurance  I lost my insurance  This year  They change companies  That happens all the time  Yeah they always like  Private insurance  Changes all the time as well  But what if I enjoy 
[02:26:00]  The insurance I have  Right now  If the private insurance  Keeps it  Then you can keep it  But now also  How are the insurance companies  Going to compete  Against a government  Insurance company  That is in essence  Cheaper  Right  This will probably  Undermine the insurance companies  Which probably isn't  That good of a thing  I think less choices  Will be out there  And I don't want to be  Under the government's insurance  I don't want to be  That's fine  But you got four things  Going on there  The first of all  Is you're talking about  The public option  Which may or may not 
[02:26:30]  Make it in  The second is  You're saying  Whether or not  It can compete  And drive private insurance  Companies out of business  Personally  I feel if like  If the government  Can push money around  Which is really  All insurance is  And do it cheaper  Than private insurance  Why should I have to pay more  Cheaper is never better  When it comes to the government  By the way  To insurance  Never  To insurance  To insurance  That's what I mean  It's just pushing money around  That's all it is  Insurance doesn't  Cure any disease  Doesn't make any drugs  Doesn't do anything  It's just pushing around  Nothing the government does  Is better  Is done better 
[02:27:00]  Than a private entity  Can do it  It just isn't  Government  There's too many  Redundancies  Red tape  Bullshit  Fucking  20 layers of management  What does quality mean  In insurance  What does good insurance  Get us  What does it produce  At the end of the year  It means  Can I go  And if I'm Ted Kennedy  Get fucking brain surgery  At the drop of a hat  That has nothing to do  With insurance  Oh really  No  Come on  Whether or not  You can get the best doctor  Or whether you can  Weasel yourself 
[02:27:30]  Into the best clinic  Has nothing to do  With insurance  And all about  Who you are  And what kind of  Influence you have  That has  You know  Whether or not  I have Blue Cross  And Blue Shield  Or Anthem  Doesn't determine  Whether I can go downtown  And see which doctor  Oh really  Some doctors  Don't accept certain insurance  That's true  But if  Let's be honest  If there was only one insurance  They'd have to take it  Yeah but is that  They'd have to  So once you eliminate  The insurance  That's not what gets you  In to see the good doctor  It's influence  I bet you have influence  I'm not talking about  You know 
[02:28:00]  I do talk personally a lot  But I'm talking the big picture  Especially again  Of the country  Again  But you brought up competition again  For America  But you brought up competition again  And the truth of the matter  Is that in 94% of insurance markets  In the United States  There are only one or two options  Of where to buy insurance  It's a myth  That there's a lot  Of competition right now  Because in most places  You're stuck with whatever's available  In fact if you  Most jobs  You really only get one or two options anyway  Which is how most people get insurance  We're not getting a lot of competition 
[02:28:30]  A public option theoretically  Would offer another choice  Or competition  What's public option mean exactly  Now you're forcing me to defend  The public option  Which I hate doing  What exactly is it  The public option would be  The government actually providing  Another  Being acting as an insurance agent  Providing another type of  Just insurance  To people  Through the insurance exchange  That would compete with  Private insurance  It would be like  Not Medicare  But another public plan  Like Medicare  Which everybody could buy  And then it would be  Instead of 
[02:29:00]  Just taking over insurance  Correct  Why do they want to do  Like why do they  Why do they want to have  Cover everybody  Why don't they just cover people  Who can't afford regular insurance  Why are they just doing that  Because that's a bad deal  And that's to some extent  What they do right now  Because  Because people who are poor  For the most part  Or people who are uninsured  Tend to be unhealthy  And less healthy  Than people who do have insurance  So right now  Private insurance covers  About two thirds of people  In the United States  It only pays for about 
[02:29:30]  One third of care  The government on the other hand  Covers one third of people  And pays for two thirds of care  That's a bad bargain  And it's not good economics  And that's why it's a bad risk  Why don't they just give  Tax incentives  Or something like that  For the insurance companies  To take on  Or whatever it is  That would cause  The insurance company  Democrats getting incentive  Why don't they do that  To get the insurance company  To cover people  Who can't afford it  Like can't the government  Do it that way  Where they're  Well to be honest  Without the public option  Which may or may not 
[02:30:00]  Get passed anyway  Depending on how things go  That's what you're sort of getting  They're saying  You know what we're going to do  We're going to give everybody  Up to 400% of the poverty line  Subsidies  We're going to give them money  So that they can go buy  Private insurance  And that way  Everybody will get insured  But you can't just give them money  Because they'll spend it  Where they want to spend it  No no no no  It has to be given directly  To them  It will be  Now will it be  In essence  Illegal  To not be an insured American  Yes  Yes  Yes  Isn't that interesting  No  Isn't that very interesting 
[02:30:30]  We do that with car insurance  I know  But there is a liability  As far as  Hitting somebody  It's not illegal  You have to pay a fine  I mean it's just like  Pay a fine  Right  It's the government  There's lots of things  In the United States  We make people pay fines  I know  But you know something  And people got annoyed  When they made us wear seatbelts  Which by the way  Is something that  Is just kind of a safety issue  It is a safety thing  And insurance on cars  Obviously if somebody  T-bones you  And it's not your fault  You want somebody to pay  When it's your own health 
[02:31:00]  Your own insurance  That you're talking about  To make it  A finable offense  As stated by the government  To not have  Health insurance  Is  Insanity to me  I  To be  Again  You're sort of forcing me  To defend their position  Which is not what I would want to do  Exactly  I don't  I don't like the mandate  Much more than you do  But there's  Mandate  Hey  Is he here yet  What  Oh I'm sorry  You do like the mandate  You have to actually 
[02:31:30]  You must get everybody  Into the insurance pool  Healthy people  And sick people  Because you need  Healthy people's money  To pay for sick people  That's how insurance works  And so  There's two ways to do that  One is the Medicare way  Where we just say  You're all in  We'll figure it out later  We'll tax you  The second way is to say  Okay we're going to  Not tax everybody  But you're all going to have to be in  So you've got to pay  And buy it yourself  To be honest  Usually conservatives  And in the past  Conservatives  Had defended the mandate  As a much better way to do it  Than to do it through  To everybody in  Which is what Medicare does  Now of course 
[02:32:00]  You know  Through partisan fighting  They don't want that anymore  But you have to have everybody in  You can't allow healthy people  You have to  If you want a viable  Health care system that works  Because you must have  Healthy people money  To pay for sick people  When you crash your car  Yeah yeah  The money to pay for it  Comes from people  That didn't crash their car  That's the only way  Insurance would work  Right  When you get sick  You must have healthy people  To pay for it  If we let all the healthy people  Hang out  Until they get sick  And then come in  That won't work  But there have been  Usually healthy people  They have insurance  Like you said 
[02:32:30]  The healthy people  Are usually a little  Better off  But of a lot of the uninsured  I mean a lot of the uninsured  And this will feed into  Some of your things  If you want to do  A lot of the 49 million  Uninsured are healthy people  A lot of them  The vast majority of them  Yeah sure  We need them in there  Because a lot of them  Are young people  Primarily younger people  That came off  For their parents insurance  And so we need them  We need their money  We need to pay  For everybody who's not well  That's how  Socialism type of an idea  It is very social  And to think that  If you're a young guy 
[02:33:00]  You're a young guy  You get out of college  You leave your parents insurance  Now you are  You're mandated  To buy insurance  Now these are the times  In your life  Where of course  Any tragedy can happen  Something can go wrong  Whatever  But to play the odds  Like that  Odds are  You're probably  Going to be okay  Right  To not have to  Shovel money out  For a few years  Is a good thing  It's forcing people  Like you said  Forcing the healthy  To pay for the sick  That is socialism 
[02:33:30]  Like forcing the rich  To pay for the poor  Forcing the people  With food  To feed the hungry  It's  That's socialism  It's not  Technic  I mean it depends  Again  Well it depends  Because socialism  Dr. Semantics  Well that's it  Dr. Semantics  Socialism is you know  The government owning  Or running parts of businesses  In this case  It's not social  I mean they are saying  You must comply  And you must go buy  Private insurance  Well let me tell you  It's more government regulation  Than you would like  Say that's semantics  Government regulation  Doesn't mean so  Can I jump in  This is a question 
[02:34:00]  That you might be able  To answer  This is something  Is it like  Is socialism in the sense  That saying  If you drive  You must have insurance  People would say  Well that's socialist  To make people have insurance  If they drive  Is it same  Is it kind of like  Misinterpreted as being socialist  I think we've stretched  The definition of socialism  To include anything  That involves government regulation  And there's lots of things  We regulate with government  That is not social  There's a difference  Between government regulation  And just in the short time  Obama's been in there  How many fucking companies 
[02:34:30]  Have been taken over  By the government  That's socialism  You're getting no argument from me  But that's not the same thing  To swing it all the way over  And say healthier  If we had Medicare for all  If we said  Everyone's going to get Medicare  It's mandatory  We're going to tax you  It's still only  It's socialism  In terms of health insurance  It's socialized  Financed care  That's not what we're doing  We're saying  You must go  Either buy private insurance  Or pay a fine  That's  I think it's like  Two and a half percent  When you say you must  Therein lies the problem  That's not socialism  No no  That kind of is  No no  When the government  Tells you 
[02:35:00]  You must do something  Especially paying in  You know  Money to take care of  Other people  That don't have it  That to me is socialism  Do you think  Do you think  The draft is socialism  What  If we said  You must be part of the draft  Is that socialism  No not necessarily  If we say  You must pay sales tax  Is that socialism  Well it depends  On how much tax  And where it's going  If we say  You must go to like  School until the age of 18  Is that socialism  Can I jump in quick  Sales tax  Is done on things  Purchased though  Sales tax  Is you make a decision  To purchase 
[02:35:30]  So to say  You have to pay in  Is like say  If you make a decision  To purchase  You have to pay in  The decision  Is not here  What it comes down  If you must get vaccines  To go to school  Is that socialism  Well a lot of the things  You've pointed out  Are things that people  Sometimes don't do  And don't have to do  They're hardship exemptions  But they're even in this law  There are hardship exemptions  But I don't even mean  Hardship exemptions  I mean  Fucking homeschooling  Look  I don't want to go to a public school  There are ways  For small percent  Of the population  To get out  If they truly  There are always ways  I don't like the fact  That I'm paying school tax 
[02:36:00]  And I don't have a kid  But you do  Is that socialism  Yeah to me  I consider  I consider that  Being very socialistic  Because I'm paying  But I am getting  Something out of it  I'm getting a neighborhood  Without raucous kids  Running around  Fucking my house up  Well theoretically  You get something out  Of everybody  So I have to get  Something out  Do I  Higher taxes  No but I mean  You know if you want  To take it down the line  A healthier society  Theoretically more people  Should be working  Therefore we should have  More productivity  More people working  There's not even enough  Jobs out there  For the ten percent  That aren't working now  Today you're correct  Oh so 
[02:36:30]  And with Obama  Taxing the shit  Out of the rich  Which in other words  Means the people  That employ people  The unemployment rate  Will continue to go up  By the way  And even with the economy  Springing back  You're going to see  Unemployment stay  Where it is  Because people are  All they're doing  Is firing people  That's why companies  Have you heard  Companies are actually  Making a little more money  They say like  Wow I think we're kind of  There's a light at the end  Of the tunnel thing  They're making do  With paying less people  Less money  Right  To do the same work 
[02:37:00]  Right  That doesn't take care  Of the unemployed people  Correct  But that has nothing to do  With health insurance  Or health care  Well it's just another form  Of taxing  That's  When you're talking  About nationalizing banks  Or doing stuff like that  That  You're not going to even argue  Some of that stuff  Is socialism  This is not  It's going to cost  Companies like me  More money  I am going to then  Have to not  Employ people  Why will it cost  A company like you  More money  Like me  Because I am always  The first to get nicked at  Companies  That make money 
[02:37:30]  The wealthy  They are the ones  That get the hands  Shoved in their pockets  To subsidize  Where are all these  Billions of dollars  For this health care  Coming from  Well they're coming from  They're pulling back  On Medicare Advantage  Which is just waste  You should be thrilled  About that  And the second thing is  You're right  They're either looking  At one of two types  Of new taxes  Either the income tax  In the house bill  Or the excise tax  On high cost insurance  In the senate bill  But again  You're forcing me again  To defend  That's not how I do it  It's like this is  I think a bad 
[02:38:00]  But you're trying  To completely separate  The health care issue  From everything else  That Obama  The Democrats  And the liberal left  Have done  Since they've taken over  But why can you not  Do this independent of that  Why can we not do this  And I don't care  What they're doing  Because it's part  Of the same project  It's part of the same  Tax  Spend  Very left  Very socialist  Thinking  It's just part  Of that whole picture  Which isn't  I don't think  Is good for this country  It cuts down on competition 
[02:38:30]  Which has always been  A very healthy thing  This is not so much tax  I mean at least  They're making an effort  To try to make this  Not cost money  To the deficit  In the future  It's actually far less  Tax and spending  Than what I think  You've seen over the last  Eight years  Can I ask a question  About this  If you say making people pay  Who are like 20  Or the percent that's healthy  And not insured  Is the thinking behind  Forcing them to join  They have to pay  And have insurance  Even if they quote unquote  Don't want it  Because if they get sick  We're going to pay for it  Exactly  Almost like  It's the same thinking 
[02:39:00]  Where if you're driving  And you don't have insurance  And you hit me  Someone's paying for it  It's almost like  By not paying into the system  I'm going to use it  If I get sick  We're not as a society  Just going to let you  Sit on the side of the street  And die of a gunshot  Or die of cancer  Exactly  But they will bill you  You can't just  You can walk into  An emergency room  And get treatment  Anyone in this country  Can do it  You're going to get billed  That's why a lot of people  You're going to get billed  Most people who truly  Have catastrophic cancer  They don't pay it  They can't pay it  Well then what the fuck 
[02:39:30]  That ain't my problem  Well it actually is  You're paying for it in taxes  Yeah exactly  Fix that shit  They're not going to  Oh my god  Own that  They're not  No one's going to do that  No one is going to say  You know what we're going to do  I know  We're going to say  If you get sick  You're out of luck  Well mine's a fascist plan  And his is a  Radical liberal plan  A socialist plan  I'm more of a fascist  I'm more impressed  You own the fascists  I do  I'm proud  Of course you do  Of course you do  My fascist thoughts  Well that's the difference  Between you I think  And most of the people in power  They won't own the fascists 
[02:40:00]  So it's own that fascism  I tell you  I tell you  After even that  That quick little  Quick little glimpse  We got  From election day  This past  Election day  I said election day  Why wouldn't you  It's still  Real for you  Do you sense  People getting a little  Nervous at this  Healthcare thing  And how much energy  Obama is putting into it  And we have other things  Going on that need  His attention  And this healthcare thing  Is just the only thing  That's really being pounded on 
[02:40:30]  It's not  I'm not nervous about that  Because I think that  You know there's plenty  Of people working in government  Who are all working  On different things  And the truth of the matter  Is that most of the people  We see every day  Congress people  Senators  You know the president  They're not  It's not like they're  Doing the actual work  That actually gets  The stuff done  So no  I'm not worried  The stuff isn't getting done  Apparently they're not  Reading the fucking bills  Either which is nice  That's disturbing too  I'm not arguing  I mean  But I think the truth of the matter  Is that I'm  I'm disappointed  And I think that people  Are getting skeptical  Because this bill  Is just not enough 
[02:41:00]  It's not going to do  What everybody thinks  It's going to do  You don't think it's enough  I don't think it's going  To do enough good  I think it's going to  Cost too much money  And so you know  At that point it just becomes  Will do more good than nothing  I do think so  Well that seems to be  The same problem  That Clinton had  And even more so  Clinton didn't even  Get this far  But the compromises  That have to be made  Don't make it effective  Even if I thought  It was going to be effective  Let's say I thought  The Obama health care plan  Was going to be effective  With the compromises  That have to be made  Between party politics 
[02:41:30]  It just won't be  What it's supposed to be  I know you hate the socialism  But every other country  In the world  Has a system  I think you would  Define as socialism  Regardless if it's socialism  Or not  And they all  They all cost less  They all cover everyone  And they all achieve  Better outcomes  But I just heard  Horror stories  Of people like  Like you're averaging out  You're averaging out care  So instead of  You working  In this country  America is a lot different  Than every other country  I think it's based on success 
[02:42:00]  It's based on opportunity  And luck  I've said this before  And when you attain  A certain level  In this country  You just are entitled to more  I sound like a fucking  Entitled ass  But you know something  But you can still do that  That's what gives you  Drive and ambition  Is to attain something  So once you attain that  I don't want this  Thing that's been run  Through a capacitor  Where health care now  Is just this 
[02:42:30]  Level playing field  Where I might not get  As good a health care  As I can get  Because this guy  Has to get the same  Health care that I'm getting  But most other countries  And I mean the ones  That are doing a really good job  Don't have that  I mean the people  At the time  They're getting phenomenal care  I mean really really good  You hear horror stories  But you know  Anecdotes are anecdotes  You know they always talk  About the uh  You know like breast cancer  In Canada  Oh my god  Women have to wait  Until you know  But they don't  They're fucking dead  That's not true 
[02:43:00]  They do wait  For some procedures  Which are elective  Not for breast cancer  Not for things  That's just not true  And now the elderly  How about that whole  Argument that  That is completely  That one is just  The biggest joke of all  Is that it  They do not ration  At all about the elderly  Is that the same thing  As the reason  They're not handing out  Flu viruses to people  Over 50 years old  Then it's only  Yes  That right now  It's between the ages  Of I believe  12 and 50  They have supplies  For that  And that's who's getting  That's the actual opposite  Those are the people  Who are not getting the vaccine 
[02:43:30]  Yeah I think  I think  Babies and old people  Right  Yeah it's exactly right  Babies and old people  Kenny couldn't get it  Kenny could not get it  I was hearing about  On 1010 wins  My friend  That there  There's a cut off point  There's a  Yes for not getting  The group that you  Just described  Are the ones not  Getting it  They're not prioritized  Check my facts  Go for it  Because no  Kenny was saying  Because Kenny's 52  And he said that  He couldn't get it  I think because  He wasn't old enough  Old enough  It's the elderly  It's young people  It's people who are getting sick  And it's healthcare workers  It's people who are getting sick 
[02:44:00]  And there's not enough  To go around  So I probably couldn't get it  Did I get it backwards  Yeah I think you did  Fuck me  That's tough in an argument  This is how these bad things happen  That hurts me  This is how it all happens  That's a bad one  That was a slip up on the witness stand  Anthony has to get up  Off the canvas  Yeah  Because that wasn't a knockdown  That was one you threw in  That was a slip up on the canvas  You got to shake that one off  Yeah well god damn it  I wouldn't mind this  If it was the other way  Oh it is  Oh my god  Well I still mind it  Correct me  Yes  So anyway  I'm just watching how I'm getting  Completely hammered 
[02:44:30]  Holy shwire  Who cares  You humiliated yourself  And the show  Big deal  No no go ahead  Just fucking  Here doc  You want to just  No no no  I'm just going to let him  Hit himself  The whole show was counting on you  And then you let us down  No  You let us all down  I'm telling you  Okay anyway  So those things don't happen  In other countries  Excuse me while I do a  A message board person  Ectomy  There we go  Bye bye asshole  Are they killing you on the fucking  Pelt  Of course they are  Where we at with this thing though 
[02:45:00]  Is this ever going to get passed  It'll get passed  I think if they strip the public option  Out of it tomorrow  It would get passed  Immediately for the Senate  Really  And so I think that  That may be where they go  I think that they'll  They'll bring this to the committee  And they'll  Well I think  Oh fuck me  Well that's the thing  But it's going to  It's not going to do as much  As everyone thinks it does  It's absolutely not going to  Contain costs  We haven't even  You know  Health care in the United States  Costs two and a half trillion dollars  A year  A year  Perhaps  16% of GDP  All these bills  We're talking about 
[02:45:30]  The difference between  Like 80 or 90 billion a year  That is chump change  Compared to the two and a half trillion  Will it  Will it cut down  Because people  Anthony worries about  And I worry about it too  Like you know  Good doctors not making the money  They should make  Which keeps them here  Will it cut down  On their malpractice insurance  Because they pay  Large amounts of money  Will their malpractice  Will they have to pay less money  In malpractice insurance  Or they'll have to pay the same  Because they're just as suable  No  See the thing about this is  Even when they talk about  Malpractice reform  They always are talking about  Just capping damages  That's really  Because they're against  The trial lawyers 
[02:46:00]  Which don't get me wrong  There's money to be had there  Sure  But the truth of the matter  Is that even when you cap damages  That doesn't necessarily  Trickle down to cheaper insurance  Because the insurance  No no no  Oh okay  So what happens  If you  The problem with  Malpractice premiums  That nobody ever talks about  Is that different  Specialties of doctors  Have to pay way different amounts  Right  As a pediatrician  I don't pay nearly  What an  You know  An obstructive  An OB-GYN pays  Sure  Wow  I should have seen that coming  Lucky devil  So some doctors 
[02:46:30]  Pay way more than others  If they wanted to truly  Bring premiums down  And make them fair  They should spread them  Across specialties  Because it's not really fair  That a radiologist  Can make more  Than an obstetrician  But an obstetrician  Has to pay way more  In malpractice costs  Just because  That's what  What's the average  Malpractice insurance  For a doctor cost  I swear to god  You asked me this  The last time I was here  And I didn't know then  And I still don't know  I wonder what the range is  From what  Like for a pediatrician  I mean  It's pretty low  I bet you  I mean granted  It's you know  Part of my  The hospital pays it  But I bet you  It's like around  10,000  Wait a minute  Oh the hospital 
[02:47:00]  Pays the insurance  For the doctors  I didn't know that  Depends how you're employed  So like I'm actually  On salary  I'm not in private practice  Okay  I do research mostly  So the little amount  Of practicing that I do  Actually the hospital  My department covers it  So maybe it's like  10 or 15,000 dollars a year  That's almost what I pay  In fucking insurance  Right  So but  But you know  A bad bill  Could be like  100,000 dollars  You know  And that's a lot of money  Sure  For somebody who's  Practicing medicine  So that's the problem  But we need to find a way  To make it more equal  To figure out a way  To sort of pool it 
[02:47:30]  So that everybody's sharing  And that that would bring down  The cost of my practice  Insurance  Not not capping damage  Well it's like I said  In my book  The quagmire of cost  The quagmire of cost  I have a question too  Is about your book  Because this I disagreed with  You said this  The last time you were here  And I remember this  You said that certain foods  Don't make you like  Get up phlegm  Yes  But they do  They don't  Look  They don't call me  Fucking a phlegmy tits  Gym for nothing  I'm always going  Well what's that about 
[02:48:00]  Let me do it again  Maybe doing that  So the way that they  The thing is  Part of it is  Unfortunately it's in your head  And you're never going to lose that  So just stop  How do I get rid of it  Well you could either  Just convince yourself  It's not true  But I said it's not true  And all of a sudden  I felt the phlegm  And I talked  And my voice was like  Gargle gargle gargle  But what they did  What they did is actual studies  Where they gave people  Like milk  And not milk  But no one could tell  Which was which  Because they flavored it  And colored it  And when they do that  The people can't  When they don't know  What they're getting  They couldn't  No more people got phlegm 
[02:48:30]  With the milk  Than not the milk  So it's not  When you actually remove  The ability of people  To know what they're getting  They don't get the phlegm  And then they did  Other studies  Where literally  They were measuring  Like droplets  Of the size of the droplets  And mucus  And things like that  And again  No different  What causes that  That thing I get  I always have to  Clear my throat  What it drives me crazy  Like if I eat sushi  I get it more  Certain foods just do it to me  And I didn't even know  There was a pattern  Until I'm like  Oh yeah every time I eat  Is it like an acid reflux  Thing happening  No  That could be an allergy  I mean it could be  Something where you have  Some sort of allergy  Am I allergic to being sweet? 
[02:49:00]  I hope not  You are the sweetest boy  It drives me crazy  Because like a lot  I used to take mucinex  It would help  When I would perform  It's not as bad  I perform anymore  But it would  Fucking panic me  When I go on stage  So what  So you say sushi  And what else?  Yeah sushi  Milk definitely does it  Any type of milk products  Maybe a lactose thing  I thought so too  But then it could be wheat too  It's like  I don't know man  Yeah those wheat things  Are usually all or none  It's not like  It's not a subtle thing  So  And usually not  With just this kind of symptom  In your throat 
[02:49:30]  It's probably  To be honest with you  It's just  It's  A lot of it is in your head  And in your head  Doesn't mean it's not real  Like you know  People talk about  Getting like butterflies  In their stomach  That's actual pain  You know people get cramps  And actual pain  Just from being nervous  So it's not that  I'm minimizing the symptoms  It's just  There is no cure  I mean there's no  Medicine or pill  I can give you  That's going to make it better  It's just  You gotta convince yourself  It's not real  I tried that  Talk to your fucking  Throat full of phlegm  We gotta take a break  And you gotta go to Dr. Oz  Where's Penn? 
[02:50:00]  I don't know  Where is that motherfucker?  That's another reason  We gotta take a break  Cause we gotta get him in here  Cause then we got  Rob Halford coming in  Well the book is called  Don't Swallow Your Gum  And I say this complimentary  It's a great toilet book  Toilet books fucking rule  Cause literally you can read  Like a quick chapter  Or whatever  You drop a deuce  And you fucking read it  The next time you're in  You gotta get a great book to read  Your wife with the page  You just read  It's perfect  You leave it there for your wife  And point that  And say anti-woman things  But no it's a really cool book  Man it's all these medical myths  And I thought of that  I'm like god damn it  He said it was in my head  And I tried to 
[02:50:30]  Maybe I just  Maybe your body produces it  Cause it's in your head  Like the mucus is in your head  That's what I mean  If you convince yourself it's real  It's going to happen  That's scary  Yep  Alright  Alright  Dr. Aaron Carroll  It's a pleasure  Thank you  Stop by and see us  Next time you're in New York  Risk groups  People who are with  CDC  His son qualifies  Under this  To vaccinate  But his daughter doesn't  People 12 years and older  Okay  CDC  People 6 months  24 years  You're going to lose  Prevention for vaccines  And people who are 
[02:51:00]  25 to 64  Yep  Or with chronic medical conditions  Yes  So where's the  25 to 64  I'm guessing  What if you're older than 64  Then you get it  What  Then you get it  You're not eligible  Unless you have a chronic medical condition  Between that age  People who live with  Or care for infants  Younger than 6 months  Health care workers  And people  25 through 64  With chronic medical conditions

Don't look  Chaz  That wasn't Chaz Bono  No  It wasn't  I tell you how much I love  The way Halford talks  When he talks to Eddie Trunk  Eddie  Eddie  The metal  No fucking  Bad motherfucker  Right before he went back on 
[02:55:30]  I go to Jimmy  I go Jimmy  Why did you like  Used cars so much  Because Jimmy references the movie  And says it's one of your favorite comedies  Of all time  So I finally got the Netflix  For the PS3  Which is like  I don't know  Oh welcome  Oh it fucking rules  And I said  You know what  The first movie I'm going to watch  With this damn thing  Is one of Jimmy's favorite comedies  Used cars  With Kurt Russell and the gang  Maybe it doesn't hold up  Jack Warden  And I was  I don't know  It was alright  Yeah maybe  Thank you  Maybe it doesn't hold up  Like  Because don't forget  I saw it many years ago 
[02:56:00]  But I've watched it recently  And I still love it  Because there's certain moments  Like with movies for me  There's just certain little  I used to work for everybody  But I love the scene  When her fucking tits  Like when that dress comes up  And just the way he goes  When he goes  Oh she's caught on the hood  On him  Oh don't you hate women  I think that's just such a  Comedically great line  I love fucking  Frank McRae  Through the whole movie  I love  Frank McRae  Frank McRae is the black guy  The black guy  Getting in the motherfucking car  Getting in the motherfucking car  When the dog pisses on his face  Toby  And he's chasing 
[02:56:30]  There's a lot of stuff  That made me laugh  But again overall  It's probably like a  Kurt Russell is a goddamn good actor  Yes he is  I mean is that  Is that okay to say  Quite a while  Yeah man  I still used car sales  I mean he was perfect  Yeah  I mean it was  I liked it  It's not a great  I mean maybe it's like  You forget that every movie  Had to have tits in it  That was refreshing  To see that again  Hey look  A pair of tits  Yeah  And tits for no reason  By the way  It's just like  Alright just show your tits  It's time to show some boobies  Titties  Yeah it was alright  Jack Warden was good  Yeah in two rolls 
[02:57:00]  To do that  Grabs his crotch  I liked him a lot  He reminds me of my friend Dean  I guess that's why I like him  Because my friend Dean  Used to always do that  And he did it in front of my mother  Like the guy would grab his crotch  And go hey amigo  And grab his cock  So Dean  Would always do that  And he didn't care who was around him  I think my mother  My grandmother  Did it in front of  And they  One time  We would fucking  Dean was on my front lawn  And we fucking  He cut the grass with a mulcher  And we took mulch  And we put it down his pants  So he's on my front lawn  And he pulls his pants down  And he's pulling grass 
[02:57:30]  Out of his fucking  Private areas  On my front lawn  And my fucking family  And my neighbors saw him  They hated Dean  Penn  Gillette  Canceled  The info  I got  Wes  That  He's  Sick  Probably Drew  I mean he's never blown the show off before  Gotta give him the band for the doubt  He's uh  He doesn't look good on Fox 5 right now  Oh  It's Carly Simon  Oh  Jesus Christ 
[02:58:00]  Wow  Carly was pulling it off  From the long shot  When she was on stage  Wow that time is a bitch  But uh  Wow  Oh  Oh look look  There's a little  You can't put a magnifying glass  Stop it  The cover of her album  Is her looking through a magnifying glass  From the other side  So it's magnifying her eye  Eye  And there isn't one fucking  Anything going on  They photoshopped  The shit out of her  Or anything  She looks horrendous  Eddie  Hey uh  Steven Tyler's saying  Speaking of um  Carly Simon 
[02:58:30]  Cause they look pretty similar  Steven Tyler's saying  That he did not leave  Aerosmith  Yes he went to a gig last night  With Aerosmith  No with uh  Joe Perry I think  Did something in the city  And Tyler showed up at it  And they sang  A walk this way  I think it was me  That reported yesterday  He was absolutely out of band  And uh  I might have heard it wrong  I was saying  In the break  When old band myself  Were walking  And uh  You know  Just me hanging with the boys  And talking to Anthony  About how fucking great it was  Yeah  Cock's always out  It's one of my favorite moments 
[02:59:00]  I'd say in the last 11 years  Is that  There was just no  Retracting  Just me  Falling completely  On my face  With your hands  Behind your back  I swear to you  I was listening to that  On Wednesday this morning  On the news station  And I must have fucking  Either the anchor person  Said it backwards  Or didn't include the part  Where it's like  They're the ones that are  Like not included  Or option C  You didn't get it  I just fucked up  And then he shut up 
[02:59:30]  And then he was trying  To find the fact  I was just looking  For anything  And this is the beauty  Of Anthony  That was a hell of a fight man  But he got you in the end  He starts reading  The CDC information  But before he reads it  To himself  He just reads it out  Because he saw the numbers  He goes  Oh my god  Numbers  Numbers  I'll just read numbers  Just reproving the guy's point  I was on the canvas  On the canvas  Going  What happened  You're a double agent  Democrat  Deep down you hate guns  Yes  Exactly  What are you going to say  At the big debate  God damn it  They kill innocent children  Yes  Good news 
[03:00:00]  Rob Halford  Is on his way up  Good  We'll talk to him  In a few minutes  Dave in San Diego  Dave  Hey boys  What's going on  Hey  Hey did you guys  Happen to see the clip  Of Hugh Heppner  On Dancing with the Stars  Last night  Oh my god  What did that look like  No  No  He looked like  Any ghoul  In any horror movie  His jaw was dropped  He's dead  His jaw was dropped  He's walking dead  He  Since the last  Girls Next Door  He's aged a lot  And I think  There's only about  A year difference  Between the last 
[03:00:30]  Filming and the new one  Is there just  Something with people  That get that age  That they can't  Put weight on anymore  Probably  It's like that  Because they just  Look like  Like walking skeletons  That's  Eat something  Maybe it's all  That sex he's having  If I was with  Those three blondes  Like him  I wouldn't be  Eating either  You know  Except for  Well  Like he's actually  He's got the creepiest laugh  Check out his laugh  Next time  Maybe  Maybe the boys  Could get his laugh  From Girls Next Door  You can hear it  When he's going to the bank  I bet  How about you 
[03:01:00]  83 years old  It was cool  When he was walking around  In his pajamas  When he was in his 40s  And 50s  Oh back in the old days  But now that he's in his 80s  Walking around like that  It's just downright  Not right  They'd actually  They had a show  And he'd bring him down  Immediately  Of course  Because we're getting  The fuck out of here  They had a show  Where he was hosting  At the Playboy Mansion  And it would be like  Hey I'm Hugh Hefner  And he'd have this pipe  And everything  And the ascot  With the robe  It's like  Just hanging around  The mansion  With a few girls  I don't have time  To put pants on  Because I got girls  That are going to  Suck my dick 
[03:01:30]  It's the coolest  Motherfucker  Yeah  Not now  Playboy clubs  Used to be everywhere  You'd have the key cards  I didn't  I was too young  I was too young  I was too young  But I remember uncles  And stuff like that  And my dad  Like had the Playboy  Had the Playboy club  Oh god  The key cards  And uh  There were  Oh man  The fucking Rob Halford  Get your ass in here  Yeah  Rob Halford everyone  Nice  What's up Rob  Mr. Halford  Been seeing you all over  The television  All over 
[03:02:00]  The telly lately  That morning show  Yeah huh  Yeah so you're doing  A morning show  And I'm like  Alright there's Rob Halford  We know him  Heavy metal god  And  And  And he's selling  Clothes  Like what  What  I was only there  For the male models  Is that it  The one was really hot  I saw a few of those  I thought maybe you  Handpicked them  No but somebody  Must have been thinking  About me  Because I know my type  Do you  I was just going to ask you  Do you have a type 
[03:02:30]  Or I'm sure you do  What is it  Or what do you find  No anything with a penis  Works for me  So don't get too close  Right now  You should all take  Taking a piss with us  Before  We were doing the  You hold mine  I'll hold yours  On the bathroom  Yeah we're all  Pretending to make  Eye contact  Yeah there's like  There's a really funny  Video on YouTube  From Holland  Where there's like  Three guys  Signing at the urinal  And the one guy  Reaches over  To the other side  And the other guy  Reaches over  To the other side  It's some strange  Like Dutch  Comedy  You know that's  Their kind of  Twisted sense 
[03:03:00]  Which is why  I have an apartment  In Amsterdam  It seems like  Now it's like  You're joking about it  You're very comfortable  It's like when you came out  It sent like shockwaves  And then all of a sudden  You're back and  You're doing Judas Priest  And nobody cares  And it just shows you  The  Thank you  It just shows you  The  My audience  Don't give a shit  Quite frankly  They just want me  To get on stage  And do my gig  Just want you to rock  And I thought it was great  I thought it just showed you  The  You know  That  That the people  That support me  Just don't care about  That kind of stuff  Yeah 
[03:03:30]  What finally made you do it  Like what  I know it's a huge decision  It's a big decision  And you know  There's probably people  Listening now  They might be thinking about  Should I step forward  Or go to your left  Yeah  You go  They misunderstand  Transsexual  What's a part of New York  Meatpacking district  Who doesn't love a girl  In a dress  With an extra gift  Jesus  They act like they've  Never fucked a tranny  Rob  I don't get it  Jesus Christ  It's just girls  With giant clits  Yeah so anyway 
[03:04:00]  Yeah  It was a good thing to do  It's a great moment  Was it something  Were you  Was somebody threatening  To out you  Or did you just go  You know what  It's time  No  I mean if that  If that had outed me  I could have  Quite frankly  Give a shit  You know  At that point in my life  I was just having  So much fun  With my musical career  You know  And especially  Being able to  Fulfill a lot of my  Music  Outside of Priest  I was just ready  For everything  And anything  And it felt like 
[03:04:30]  The right thing to do  I would have never  Have done it  While I was in Priest  Because I loved my band  So much  And you know  I think that's  That's the big dilemma  That people  That are going through  This struggle  Have to face  You're putting everybody  Else first  And that isn't the way  To live  You know  You've got to put  Your own house in order  And then you can  Do whatever afterwards  Especially with a band  Like Priest  Because that  You know  Especially at that time  Of just  In the 80's  You know  80's  With you know  Vince and Nicky 
[03:05:00]  And all those  Other great guys  And the irony is  All the guys were  Looking like chicks  In the 80's  In Bangles  They got all the  Fucking lipstick on  And the rouge  And the fucking  Like tranny hair styles  And stuff  You know  How ironic  But no  Anyway  It took a while  But it's  It's been out in the open house  Since 19th  Have you been political  Have people asked you  To be political about it  Yeah they have  They have  I'm seeing Larry  A little bit later on  Like Mr. Flick  On his show  But I'm not  Smart enough to do  Wait Rob 
[03:05:30]  You've been out since 93?  Yes  I'm not smart enough  To deal with the issues  There's far more  Articulate people  That know what's really going on  I know what the basics  Of the struggle are  But whatever  To you does it just seem like  You know  This is my life  And I don't have to get up  On a fucking pulpit  And discuss  This that  Exactly  It's just  Alright here it is  But now I'm going back  To doing my music  That's all I live for  I've been you know  I've been a professional metalhead  For 38, 39 years now  Doing what I love  You know 
[03:06:00]  And just because of this thing  That's also there  You don't have to be a spokesperson  Exactly  I just want  Just give me a mic  And let me wail  A mic  A bill  A peach  Whatever  I know a really hot mic  In the Navy actually  The Navy  Is it  Now is that hysterical  I'm working my way  Through the arms  Is it  Is that a stereotype  Or just a joke  That gay guys like  The guys in the Navy  Or is the Navy  The one that  No it is  I think that's just  It's a joke  It's a stereo  It's a stereo  But I'm at that point 
[03:06:30]  I would just like to give a shout out  To all the veterans  Because it's Veterans Day today  Yeah  So you know  Even though I'm a Brit  And I spend most of my time  In this country  I know how important  This day is for the vets  We've been pals with the Brits  Since like the 1700s  Yeah we gave you this country  You know  We said you want America  Keep it  You know  Yeah yeah  Go back to our little  Island in the middle  Sent a few people over  To make us feel good  Like we won it  Or something  Like oh look  Let them think  They won the fucking country  We don't even want the shit anymore  Yeah but there are 
[03:07:00]  There are some  There are some residual things  Hanging over  Like we have the tea  Over in England  Yeah  But you Americans  Like to do the  The tea bagging  Tea bagging  Yes  We brought bagging  To tea time  I'm like  My friends are texting me  Going the Americans  Are tea bagging  At last  We figured it out  We took a boring beverage  And made a fun  Scruttle  Coniliation  Jesus  And here's the thing  Here's the great statement  It's like  I went and saw you guys  I'm a Heaven and Hell freak  And I fucking love Priest 
[03:07:30]  And I went and saw  Heaven and Hell Priest  In Jones Beach  And it's like  Nobody can care about anything  About your personal life  Watching you perform  Exactly  It's fucking  It's Alfred and it's Priest  And the fucking  It was as good as it was  Fucking 20 years ago  I mean your voice  That was a great tour  That was an amazing tour  The Metal Masters tour  Yeah  It was Motorhead  And it pissed down with rain  Again  Oh did it  At Jones Beach  It always rains  It always rains  And you've got to get  All the gear  Through a tunnel  That's gone angry  With your lifestyle  Strike me dead 
[03:08:00]  God doesn't want  To strike him dead  So just  Oh a little rain  On everyone  A little rain  Yeah  Ruining my hair  But yeah  That's  Apart from  Whatever  It's a real good venue  And all the  Strong Islanders  Are there  Just going crazy  For the band  How do you keep  Your voice  It's like  A lot of singers  They just lose it  Over the years  And you  One thing I've heard  About you  Is you've kept  That voice  I don't know  What it is  I was talking  To Alice yesterday  Back in Phoenix 
[03:08:30]  Doing his show  Cooper  Yeah  And we were just  Talking about  The way we  Deal with it  Alice has got  A remarkable voice  For the character  That he plays  And the stuff  That he works on  We both use  These in-ear monitors  Which is a real  Blessing  Because up until  That point  You were screaming  Above the guitars  And the drums  And trying to get  Yourself heard  Did you ever feel  Though in the early days  Where you did have  Stage monitors  Blasting at you  That it made you  Push more  Yeah 
[03:09:00]  And almost  Like I always thought  It made it  It made it sound  A little better to me  To yell a little more  During certain songs  Whenever I used  An ear monitor  It was like  Too  Too clinical  Yeah  Yeah  No again  We talked about  That point  Because he was  Really resistant to it  For that very same  Reason and so was I  And then  It was a show  I went to  Many many years ago  And it was  It was  Sebastian back  In Van Halen  And he was  He'd got those  Things in his ears 
[03:09:30]  What the hell  He got in your ears  And he goes  Oh dude  You know Sebastian  You gotta try these  Another great thing  In the world  And it'll save your life  Blah blah blah  And that was it  So from that point  On I've used them  But in fact  I probably  I'm able to get  More into my performance  Now because I can really  You can hear what you're doing  Yeah what I'm doing  Save your fucking ears too man  Exactly  Like standing in front of that shit  For that many years  But the rest of the guys  You walk past Glenn's stack  And it's like a  You know an H5 hurricane  Yeah  You know I mean it's just  It's this wall of fucking noise  It's just absolute  I mean he's got the monitors 
[03:10:00]  And he's  You know  You know  When you get the wind blowing  In your face  He's pulling his skin  You're feeling the fucking  You're feeling the speed  With the air coming off of him  How the hell does he do it  It's amazing  Did you deal with  Any tinnitus or anything  Because you guys  Were fucking like loud  Yeah  The band is still  Incredibly loud  Yeah  No shit  I mean that's what  You know  That's what we're about  To make it  Yeah  Yeah  Nobody wants to fucking hear  Electric Eye  Played softly in acoustic  Well I told you that time  I went to fucking  I went to see a band  That I grew up just loving 
[03:10:30]  For the  You know  Because they're fucking hardcore  It was Blue Oyster Cult  I love Blue Oyster Cult  So  And this is going back  Years ago now even  I went to go see him  In Huntington  And I'm listening to him  Doing these songs  And you could  You could turn to  Who was next to you  And go  Oh this is great  They're doing astronomy  And you'd be like  I don't want to hear him like this  I want to hear him loud  Yeah  And the pre-show is  I want a beer  Right now  And then you still don't  You know  Skip the message across  But you have to use  Sign language at pre-shows  There are some 
[03:11:00]  There are some bands though  That were  Very heavy in the day  And then  They lightened up  And turned into  A whole other entity  Where you guys  Kept  Kept rocking man  Yeah  And you to this point  Even still  You know  The volume's up  You're fucking kicking ass  Yeah  Nostradamus  Nostradamus  Nostradamus is a really  Really intense record  You know  Got some  Really strong stuff on there  And so it is  You know  You might wonder  I mean metal is everything  You know  A band like Priest  Can be the painkiller  And then we can do  Like Beyond the Realms of Death  You know 
[03:11:30]  But the essence of  What we do  And what I'm doing now  With my solo stuff  I think you still  Got the vibe  It's a cool thing  It's called  Halford Winter Songs  And it's got you on the front  With a winter  Kind of like a white  Snowy background  Yeah but I wasn't there  That's a green screen  I was in Phoenix  It was 120 degrees outside  How funny is that  I was wondering  Why you were sweating  In the snow  Yeah exactly  And that's some kind of  Norwegian wood vibe  Going on  I look like a serial killer  You really do  That's not the picture  I want 
[03:12:00]  That's totally  This is like  This is like  Supposed to be like  A Christmas holiday  I think I look like  A satanic serial  Looks like a professional  He's about to  Fucking save a plant  And kill somebody  That kind of works though  But the only problem  I had with this  Was I couldn't read  Because it's written  In like a calligraphy  Old English  Yeah it was hard to read  Some of the song titles  Yeah it's supposed to look  You know cool  But I even  I mean  What does it say  I don't know  What is that  We were going to ask you  There's one here called 
[03:12:30]  Come all ye faithful  Obviously we know  Oh holy night  Then there's  I don't care  Light of the world  Why am I reading these  Perfectly now that he's here  Because I couldn't read them  Yeah he couldn't read it  Look at that  Christmas for everyone  How many of these  Are kind of classics  There's ten songs  Six of them  Are the classics  And four of them  The band wrote  Did you always want to do it  Or is it you know  You know  I loved the holiday season  And you know  The eating and the drinking  And the hanging out  With your family and friends  And stuff  And there's always music  In the background  And there's 
[03:13:00]  For me there wasn't  Enough of this kind of  Vibe going down  So this took a while  To put together  But now we've  What style  What style is this now  It's rock  It's that opening cut  Getting to the spirit  You know  It's got all the intensity  Of like the painkiller vibe  Really  We've got to play one of these  Yeah  Drums and screaming vocals  Yeah  It's a real  Real good opener  I've been a big critic  I'm sure Eddie Trunk  Talked to you about this too  Of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame  And just how fucking shitty  They've been to metal  But after Sabbath got in  It seems like it's  Opened the door  And now Metallica's in 
[03:13:30]  But bands like yourself  I mean do you guys think  You'll be in the hall  Or Motorhead  I don't know  I'd love to  It would be a great honor  Because it's  You know  It carries a lot of value  And a lot of prestige  I don't know how that game works  How do you even get in it  I don't know  Who the fuck votes  It's guys that are in it  And also a lot of older  It's really a shitty system  But now what they're doing  Is they're putting guys like  LL Cool J to be nominated  Madonna  Simply because they probably  Weren't making money  So they want to open it up  Just as a money making thing  Oh great  Yeah that keeps its credibility 
[03:14:00]  But it's disgusting  That you guys aren't in  Or that Rush isn't in  I mean just bands  That contributed so much  You know what it is  Bands that were very  I think bands that were  Very influential  Over the years  And not copiers  But leaders  Like you guys  When MTV first broke  We were in  Priest was one of the  First bands  Yeah you guys are on it  And I remember  Fucking turning it on  And just going  Holy shit  You know  It was in the  12 song rotation  You sit there and watch  The Priest video  Yeah the 12 song rotation  It was like 12 songs  Yeah there was Devo  And there was 
[03:14:30]  Fucking Priest  Chilliwack I think  Was one of them  Right  But you'd  Fucking sit and watch that  Because you know  Except for like  Don Kirshner's rock concert  You weren't really  Able to sit and see  And watch a band  Performing like that  Unless you went to the shows  So I think it's influential  Yeah we had a lot of fun  Making those videos  I mean you've seen them  You know  Hot rocking in the sauna  Setting me on fire  Setting me on fire  In free will burning  And you know  Blowing people up  In another thing coming  One of the 
[03:15:00]  One of the funniest  Fucking  Beavis and Buttheads  Were when  I think it was  You got another thing coming  I'm not sure  And  Butthead goes  What's he doing  With his shoulders  Do you like dancing  Skip out of that  Skip out of that  Fucking limo  I was laughing  My balls off  You know  I don't know  What's he doing  With his shoulders  I don't know  But this rocks  He didn't care  Yeah that was a great day  Out in Soho 
[03:15:30]  In London  Next door to the pub  You know  We were all  We were all pissed as farts  Drinking between takes  It was just a crazy day  We were watching  Some old 80's videos  Do you ever look back  At old videos and stuff  And like go like  Oh  Yeah  Absolutely shouldn't you  It's like me in Turbo Lover  You know  What is that look  What's going on  You're a Turbo Lover  I'm all spritzed  I'm all spritzed  And bulging  And everything  Turbo Lover should be  That's what it is  Oh no this is  Painkiller  This is 
[03:16:00]  This is one of  This is one of  My all time favorites  I feel like killing you  Peterson playing  Oh  God damn  God damn  What a fucking voice  Dude  Jesus  I just want to listen  You really did just want to  Fucking kill something 
[03:16:30]  That is music to kill by man  Holy shit  What a unique  Fucking strong voice man  There's nobody  That sings like you  Yeah with that range too  You got one fuck of a range man  Probably because I just got one testicle  Is that it?  Yeah I've only got one sadly  Do you really?  For real?  Oh come on  I have two big balls  And you know  They're hanging to my knees  At this time of my life  This is where I'm wearing loose pants  And I'm going  I've gone commando 
[03:17:00]  I was going to get mad  That I wasn't in your bio  I was going to scream  How do we not know  This man has one ball  We can talk about  We can talk about  One ball for an hour  That's easy  Well Hitler only had one ball  Did he really?  Yeah  Made him a little angry  Which is what he started  Yeah the compassion ball  Didn't drop  It made him a little testy  Oh stop  It's actually pretty funny  We got some fans  On the line here  Let's go to Jeff  In St. Augustine  Jeff Rob Halford  In studio today 
[03:17:30]  Rob  Hello Jeff  We were down  We played in your location recently  Didn't we?  Did you come see us?  I damn sure did  Okay cool  Nice  I've seen you about six times now  Alright  Back to the  Screaming for Vengeance tour  Well you go way back  That's great  I go way back  And I just wanted to let you know  That you're real fans  You're true fans  Yeah  We knew all along  That you were gay  Never had a problem  There you go  There you go  I was hiding  And I didn't need to hide 
[03:18:00]  Does it feel like  I'm sorry to interrupt you  Go ahead Jeff  No that's good  I was just going to ask Rob  Because you're in like  The metal scene  Which is such a kind of  Like an alpha male  Or aggressive chick fucking scene  Right right  Did it feel dishonest  Or did it feel  How did it feel  Living like that  And knowing you had to  Present a certain front  Which denied  You know  It wasn't  It wasn't any real big deal  To me  Because I was already  Established in my work  You know  And so I was just  Doing my gig  Never even  You just don't think 
[03:18:30]  About that kind of thing  You just go out  And do your metal  And that's what it's all about  But I mean  If you had somebody  That you were seeing  Like you knew  Like you couldn't be photographed  Like you know  Like you guys  Walking around  With your chicks  Or whatever  Yeah but the irony is  You know  For the longest time  I mean  I didn't really  Come to the terms  Of understanding  About myself  Until really later on  In life  You know  Like in my  Mid late 20s  When I was trying  To figure it out  Because I'd been  I'd been hanging out  With chicks  I'd been fucking chicks  Up for  You know  For the longest time 
[03:19:00]  And so  It's just  That's why  It was kind of  A crazy feeling  You know  What's going on  So  You know  But  I think the main thing  When you're a professional  Musician  Is that  Okay  That's in your life  But your main aspect  Is just doing the best  Geek  That you can possibly do  I think yeah  You know  Your sexuality  Is a part of your life  But  You have other things  That  Kind of take precedent  Your fucking work  Your career  Your music  Shit like that 
[03:19:30]  And then you know  When you want to fuck  Whoever the fuck  You want to fuck  You fuck them  That's it  That's pretty much it  That's how I think about it  It's just like  You know  Whether you're hetero  Or you're fucking gay  It's not like  Alright  I like fucking girls  How is that affecting my job  No but  It's really not  No the question I was asking  Is only because  Of people's perception  It could make it  A different perception  Of being in  Priest  Yeah like  Was it frustrating  To ever 
[03:20:00]  Like you know  If me and my girl  Go somewhere  Whenever a girl  They're dating  I'm doing comedy  If we want to go somewhere  Anybody walk in with her  Was it frustrating  To have to say to that person  Like well we have to  We have to behave this way now  Because there's people  Or there's fans  Or whatever  I don't ever recall  Being in that  In that circumstance  Quite honestly  No  And I think again  Just because  Just because  You know  I was putting my band  And my bandmates  And my fans first  Which I still do  To a great extent  You know  You didn't  You didn't put yourself  In those kinds of  Scenarios  Where somebody could  Take a picture 
[03:20:30]  Or the room  And that's  That's the other crap  You go through all the  Stupid fucking  Childish rumours  And innuendo  And I'm like  I'm sick of this  Let's get it out of the way  You know  And there it goes  Did you talk to your guys first  Your band  Did you talk to them first  You go look  This is what's going to happen  You know  Just to reflect on the moment  I was doing something  For MTV  I was working on that  Two project  With Johnny  Johnny Five  And Trent Reznor  And I was up at the MTV studios  Here in New York  And I was in  Yadda yadda yadda  Blah blah blah  And speaking as a gay man  Bang bang bang  And the guy dropped his clip 
[03:21:00]  And then  And that was it  Firestorm  And ran the planet  For like two or three days  Did it slip out  Or did you just  Highly fuck it  You know  In all honesty  It wasn't a planned event  Yeah  I was just  Riffing away  And just talking  And it happened  And I thought  Oops  There it was  You know  Must have been a load off your show  I'll wait off your mind  It did  It was  Yes  It was a load off  Yeah  Yes  All of that  Let's go to Maximum  Maximum  We got Rob Halford in studio 
[03:21:30]  Yeah Rob  Maximum  Is that your real name  Is that your real name  Rob  Is that like  Trojan Maximum  Maximum  Anyway bro  What's up  Well  I just want to tell Rob  That Judas Priest  Was the first metal band  I ever listened to  Yeah  You guys  You guys fucking rocked  And I kind of got out of you  Out of you guys  Wasn't really listening to you  And recently I heard  Nostradamus  Yeah  And I thought  I thought it was older shit  I mean you  You still have it  You sound great  You're fucking awesome Rob  Thanks man  I really appreciate it  That's really cool 
[03:22:00]  Do you know about this guy  In Cleveland  Who has listened to Nostradamus  Every single day of his life  Since he came out  Really  Yeah he's listened to it  About  I don't know  When did that record come out  Like almost two years ago  So he's listened to it  Close to a thousand times  Jesus  A thousand times  And he dresses up  Like Nostradamus  And he's a bachelor  But he has a dog  And he sits there  And he comes home from work  And he dresses up  Of Nostradamus  And he gets his dog  And he puts it on  And he sits there  And he listens to the whole record  An hour and forty minutes 
[03:22:30]  Or whatever it is  To CDs  Of Nostradamus  That's just  I don't know what it is  It's insane  A little bit  He's the most insanely dedicated  Priest fan  You could ever wish to know  But I was just talking to some friends  In Cleveland on the radio  The other day  And they go  Hey  I said what's up with Jim  He goes  You might have to stop listening  You know  It's  There's some strange things  It's going on right now  It's getting a little odd  You know  We're getting to about 958 plays  You know  After work  Jesus  So 
[03:23:00]  But that just goes to show  That priest fans  Are the best fans in the world  What does he do for a living  That's the important question  I never asked him  I met him  I never asked him  Please find out what he does  Because you might just drive around  And lop heads off  Serial killer  Let's continue with the phones  Ron in Georgia  Ron  Hey  I was wanting to ask Rob  If there was a plan  To do a  Screaming for vengeance  Tour  Like they did with the  British Steel album  This last time  Thanks buddy  You know  I don't know  What year was Screaming for vengeance 
[03:23:30]  1980 something  Can somebody  Google issues  I would guess  82  You know  It must be nice  To be able to go like  What the fuck year was that  That fucking  Massive head  Yeah that huge head  Or something  I don't know  Google it  It's like  Google it for me  I do know  That British Steel  Turns 30 years of age  Next spring  It's the 30th anniversary  British Steel  Shit  And that's why  This guy was just mentioning  We just went through  America on our second leg  And we flipped from 
[03:24:00]  Nostradamus to  Getting the party  Started early for  British Steel  We made a movie  That's going to come out  In the spring of 2010  To go with  The official anniversary  Oh really  What's the movie  All about  Documentary  Just the live show  Yeah live show  And anything else  We can find to put in  You know what song  Is very underrated  By Priest fucking  And if you're not  Like a hardcore  Priest fan  You should go  It's a fucking  Rapid fire  What an underrated  Fucking song that is  That's a great way  Of course  That's the  You know  There were two versions 
[03:24:30]  Of the way  The running order  Went over in America  It started  British Steel  Starts with  Breaking the law  That's the way  The label wanted it  But everywhere else  In the world  It starts with  Rapid fire  So that is the first song  That we played  On this current  British Steel tour  And what a great  The opening line  The first thing you hear  Is pounding the world  Like a battering ram  Yeah it's fucking  Do you have that  It's fucking  Such an underrated song  It bugs me  Yeah  Pounding the world 
[03:25:00]  Like a battering ram  Jesus  This is fucking  Phenomenal  All I want to do  Is listen to this song  And tap Rob  And go  Do you remember  When you sang this part  The annoying fan voice  Yeah  What's that  What was that  Like Greg  A comedian  From Saturday Night Live 
[03:25:30]  Chris Farley  Chris Farley  When he does that thing  With McCartney  Yeah  You remember  When you were in the booth  He's like pulling his hair out  That was awesome  That was awesome  We love that  Hey let's go to Greg in Atlanta  Greg  Greg  Hey I wanted to  Rob big fan man  Thanks bro  And Ovi and Anthony and Jimmy  Thank you  Big fan  I wanted to  Ask what was the  Meaning behind  Or what was the idea  Behind covering  Diamonds and Rust  And the boys were talking about  Jimmy was just bringing this up  The other day  I brought this up the other day 
[03:26:00]  Because I finally heard  What a fucking  I literally was teary eyed  I'm very emotional  When I don't sleep  Oh Joan Baez  Joan Baez's version  I couldn't stop  Fucking listening to it  I could not stop  Listening to her version  Of Diamonds and Rust  What  Maybe  Mary  I knew you'd ruin it  All I could think of  By the way  Is I'm enjoying this song  Is of him going  Why  Shut it off  He ruins everything  What made you cover that song  It was such a great cover  Yeah it was  It was the label's idea  We were starting to make  Headway in America 
[03:26:30]  And you know  They said  We need a truck for radio  I mean this is going what  80 something  81  So yeah  No before then  Give us a minute  We'll get some fucking hits  For America  You asshole  So they sent us  I remember  We were in Rockville Studios  In Wales  Which is a great  Really famous studio  And they sent us  A 45 record  Vinyl  And they said  This is our idea  So we huddled around  The record player  And put the  Put the  The record on  And then you hear  This little guitar 
[03:27:00]  Twinking  Here comes your voice  Thank you  They want us to do  A metal version of this  But the truth of the matter is  It's a beautiful song  It's an incredible song  And a great song  We'll take any interpretation  So we  We kind of put our stamp on it  And then fast forward to  Live Aid in Philly  At the JFK Stadium  In 86 or something  And I'm backstage  And there's this lady  Walking up to me  And it's John Baez  And I'm thinking  Oops  She goes 
[03:27:30]  I just want to tell you  That's my favourite son's  Interpreter  My son's favourite song  That I've ever done  That's been interpreted  By another band  I thought  How cool is that  What a nice lady  You know  Somebody else would have  You jerk  You screwed my song up  Yeah you fucked my song up  But anyway  She was really cool  And it worked  It's become part of  The catalogue of  Most people don't even know  John Baez did it  To tell you the truth  Exactly  It's the same when we did  Green Man Leach  Which is a famous  Peter Green song  Who was in the original  Fleetwood Mac lineup 
[03:28:00]  You also did  And I think  I met you very briefly  At K-Rock one time  When you were doing  Ian's show  No he doesn't remember Jim  He does  Because I said  Hey Rob  Look at this face  And I stared  No we were talking about  When he performed in Philly  Because Ozzy  His voice wasn't holding up  Or he was ill  Or whatever it was  But you performed  I think with Sabbath  And did the entire  Fucking  The entire  Catalogue for the show  With Tony Gieser  And Bill  Which  That must have been  Pretty fucking great  Yeah  That was awesome  I knew I just said that  I had no question 
[03:28:30]  I don't know why I did that  But yeah  The deal is  It was the day or two  After my birthday  And I'm in  We're in Philly  And getting ready to do the show  And I get the phone call  And it's Sharon  And she goes  Hi Robbie  I said hi Sharon  They sent me some  Really cool  Dark evil  Black leather luggage  With skulls all over it  I said  Thanks so much  For the luggage  Well I'm not really  Not really calling about that  This is my  This is my Sharon Osbourne 
[03:29:00]  Actually  If you close your eyes  Isn't it rubbish  Yeah no  Close your eyes  And put your fingers  In your ears  It sounds just like  Sounds and looks like  Sharon Osbourne  But anyway  She goes  I said  What's the deal  She goes  Well you know  Ozzy's not feeling very well  I said  Oh what's wrong  He's lost his voice  He's got bronchitis  Oh okay  So can you help out  What do you want me to do  Can you sing for him  What do you mean  Can you step in for Ozzy  Yeah well  Yeah when  When  Tonight  What  This is like  Four o'clock in the afternoon  Tonight  And she goes  Well you know  You know all the Sabbath songs  And you know  You love Ozzy 
[03:29:30]  And Ozzy loves you  And you can't do the show  And blah blah blah  So  Cut a long story short  They  Courier  A motorcycle courier  Came over with a video  Of the show  From the  From the  The last night  I get on my tour bus  Go in the back lounge  Put the  The video on  And I'm singing acapella  With Ozzy  As the bus is going  To  Was it Camden  That was it  Tweeter Center and Camden  Yes  For the Philly audience  Yes  Going on  You know  Through the rush hour traffic  And blah blah blah  So just as we get there  I've done the show  Get off the bus  Go on stage  Do the priest gig 
[03:30:00]  Come off stage  To have a shower  And go back out stage  With Tony  Holy shit  Wow  What the fuck  Did they have a teleprompter  Or did you know the words  Oh teleprompter  Okay  Did the crowd know  I said  When did the crowd find out  Literally when you walked out  Yeah let me tell you what happened  Yeah because I'm wondering  What kind of reaction that would be  I said  I said to Tony  I said there's a crowd now  And he goes  I'm standing with Tony  He's got you know  He's ready to go to work  I said  Have you told the crowd  And he goes  Bill's going to tell him  I said  Bill's going to tell him  Gunner 
[03:30:30]  Is not a good word  Bill's going to tell him  I'm like  They don't know  He goes  No Bill's going to  Bill's going to read  Read a note  From us  Oh shit  I said they don't know  That puts you in a bad spot  So anyway  Oh fuck  What's going to happen  I said Tony  I said if they start bottling me  I'm at  I'm at that fucking stage  Into my tour bus  And I'm driving to  Wherever  He goes  Oh it'll be fine  Robbie  It'll be fine  So anyway  You know  The crowd's waiting  And waiting 
[03:31:00]  It's a sold out show  And the promoter walks out  And everything quietens down  You could hear a fucking pin drop  20,000 people  And you could hear  One of them fart  So  He goes  We've got an announcement  And Bill wants to  Come out  And tell you what it is  So there's like  So Bill wonders  It's Bill Ward  Yeah  And he goes  Hello everybody  I've got a note here from Ozzy  I am not able to sing tonight  Boo  You suck  Boo  Just to Bill  Poor old Bill  He goes 
[03:31:30]  Yeah I've got a really bad voice  I've got bronchitis  My doctors have told me to take a couple of days off  So my good friend Rob Halford is going to sing for me  Boo  Boo  Oh shit  And I'm looking at Tony  And we've got like  You know fear in our eyes  What are we going to do  So anyway  The intro tape starts  And I walk out  And you know  We start whatever song it is  And I said to Tony  I said  It's always four in  With Sabbath  Four bars in  I said  Just give me the nod  So all night long 
[03:32:00]  Tony was nodding  You know  And like  Come in now  And I'm like  Trying to concentrate  But we started  And the first song  Started  And I got a fucking  Ping on the head  With a plastic beer bottle  I thought  I've only sung a fucking line  And I'm throwing shit at me  And then  And then somebody  Gobbed a big  Loogie at me  And I thought  This ain't going to work  But the deal was  The deal was  Like two minutes later  The whole thing flipped  And that wonderful crowd  Just accepted it  And they thought  Hey this is better than nothing  And it was 
[03:32:30]  It ended up being  A bit of rock and roll history  And it's Halford singing Sabbath  Exactly  You know something  You might go there thinking  I want to see Ozzy  I want to see  But you know  But you saw something different  Yeah man  I heard it was phenomenal  And people said  It was really a memorable show  You're never going to see that again  It's not like some fucking  Nobody just walking  It's fucking Rob Halford  And not only this  And Jimmy please  Nothing against  The great Ozzy Osbourne  I would hope not  But  I bet Rob hit all the notes  That's all I'm going to say 
[03:33:00]  I'd let Tony was smiling  This is unique  Wow  They should release that  I love my Ozzy  He's my best mate  And you know  He was seriously  Sick  It's a lot of fun  But anyway  He recovered  A couple of days later  They're saying that Rob  Has to go in a couple of minutes  Because  Alright let me  I want to see  Tony go ahead  I don't even know  If we can get this done  But let's see  Tony go ahead  Hey Rob  Can you give us a rock  Rock scream?
