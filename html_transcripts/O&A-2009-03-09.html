<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts expressing significant anxiety and anger about their uncertain employment status at K-Rock.  Their workplace was in disarray – missing equipment, empty hallways, and their photos removed – leading them to accuse former boss Eric Logan of sabotage and current agent Bob Eatman of poor communication. This fueled a profanity-laced rant filled with graphic metaphors detailing their feelings of betrayal and Logan's perceived incompetence.  The conversation then unexpectedly shifted to Robert Kelly's underwhelming Twitter poll regarding the *Watchmen* movie, which surprisingly led to a lengthy, vulgar discussion about a foot-care product ("pet egg") and a hyperbolic scenario involving Oprah Winfrey and Eric Logan.  Robert Kelly, filling in for Jim Norton, participated in this discussion and the overall conversation about their job insecurity.  Callers Sean and Jeff were involved, with Sean being instructed to move his makeshift studio to the parking garage and Jeff being berated for suggesting their financial demands may have played a role in their predicament. The show concluded this segment with a discussion about the Amityville Horror House, Daylight Savings Time, and a fun fact about heart attacks, all while maintaining a highly offensive and sexually suggestive tone.


The show continued with a discussion about sleep deprivation, prompted by a caller, Steve from Long Island, who recounted his tiredness after visiting a house in Abneyville. Bobby was confirmed to be in the studio. A caller, Chris from the Poconos, brought up President Obama gifting the British Prime Minister incompatible DVDs, sparking a discussion about NTSC/PAL coding differences. This transitioned into a discussion about buying electronics in New York City, comparing the shady Times Square shops with the reputable B&H Photo Video. Callers shared experiences with B&H, praising its efficiency and low prices but noting its strict return policy. A listener mentioned encountering Hasidic Jews who were fans and expressed hatred for a radio personality named David, leading to a discussion of the Hasidic community and a suggestion for a “Jew poll” on Twitter.  Stryker, another caller, recounted a frustrating experience returning a faulty GPS power cord from B&H. The conversation then shifted to Patrice O'Neal's show, his reactions to excessive picture-taking, and his relationship material.  A picture of "Lady Trucker," a large woman surfing on a cruise ship, became a central topic, with numerous crude jokes at her expense.  A call from Mongo, another trucker, provided a brief humorous interlude. Lydia called to inquire about the show's Easter schedule.  The hosts again heavily discussed their potential firing, speculating on reasons for their possible dismissal, discussing their ratings, and expressing frustration with management's lack of communication. This led to a lengthy, vulgar back-and-forth with Lady Trucker, involving numerous personal insults that continued even after she countered Anthony's attacks. Ryan, a caller, challenged Anthony's behavior, prompting Anthony's defense that he only retaliated after Lady Trucker insulted him. The segment concluded with further discussion about the potential cancellation of their St. Patrick's Day broadcast at Connelly's, based on information from various sources, including E-Rock. The banter around their imminent job loss continued.


The next segment focused heavily on the rumor mill surrounding their impending departure from K-Rock. The uncertainty of their future dominated the conversation, fuelled by conflicting information and cryptic hints from various sources, including a co-worker referred to as "Iraq."  There was much discussion about a potential St. Patrick's Day concert or live broadcast and its possible cancellation, and the potential involvement of CBS and Guinness.  A listener threatened to switch stations if Opie and Anthony left.  A notable moment involved Bobby vomiting after discovering dog feces near his microphone. A contentious phone call with "Patty," who criticized Anthony's treatment of women, led to a heated debate. The studio phone lines were cut due to ongoing construction. The hosts attempted to gather information from colleagues and contacts while engaging with listeners and wildly speculating about their future.


The following segment featured Larry expressing disappointment about their potential departure and discussing his listening habits. Guest Nick Carter discussed his own career uncertainty.  The hosts joked about their job security and the station's plans. Another listener expressed concern about their job prospects due to the show's change.  The conversation included tangents on Larry's beer consumption, Highschool.com, and the hosts' plans to "rob a 7-Eleven" for satellite radio.  Larry the Cable Guy then joined the studio.  The conversation included Larry's upcoming Comedy Central roast, a detailed account of a fight between Rich Voss and a heckler (involving head kicks), Larry hitting a deer, and numerous off-color jokes about race, appearance, and sex. They discussed their experiences in radio and management issues.  The segment concluded with calls, including one from Heather, and further off-color jokes and banter. Robert Kelly was also present in the studio at various points during this segment.


The final segment featured Larry the Cable Guy and began with a brief discussion of a comedian's physical altercation on stage. This transitioned into a series of crude and offensive jokes about various racial and ethnic groups, including redheads, Black women, and Asians, focusing on physical characteristics and sexual differences in highly offensive and stereotypical terms. Larry the Cable Guy participated, sharing his own experiences and preferences using similar offensive language.  A significant portion involved a graphic and vulgar description of a hypothetical encounter with a woman from a fictionalized African tribe, emphasizing her supposed unhygienic attributes. They discussed a TV show featuring people living with a tribe, focusing on cultural details including a penis gourd.  A picture of a woman prompted further vulgar commentary on her appearance. The conversation meandered through Larry's weight loss, his wife's sexual preferences given his weight loss, and Anthony's hair plugs.  The segment concluded with plugs for Larry's Comedy Central roast and Bob Kelly's stand-up show, followed by farewells and further banter.

Yeah whatever  Don't worry about the burning of the bridge thing  We allegedly had a couple of sex in a church  And guess what  We ended up working for the same company  I know  A mere few years later  That's what I mean  Like they get a whole new crop of management in  Right  Like man  You can only throw away so much air staff  Before they come looking for management to throw away to  Right  Like management goes  Ah we gotta do this  We gotta

[00:31:30]  I haven't ended the poll yet  I'm gonna have  Two people are commenting  And saying  I'm gonna have my first  Twig poll today  You might want  You might want to turn off  Your twitter today  Literally a twig poll  Right  I uh  Robert Kelly is  I went  Question mark  I didn't even think  This is the problem  Is that you look  I have a lot of comic friends  Other than people  That would be on this show 
[00:32:00]  Right yeah  And they're you know  I know what you're gonna try to say  We're a little edgier  Than everybody else  And all that  But this is like  Well hang on one second  This is what little  Little little  Teenage girls  Would run to  Hang on  I have all these other people  And I see their  Like my other friends  Comics in the business  Yeah  The way they tweet  It's like hey fans  You know blah blah blah  Yeah  I hate fans  And you know  You see them like  Hey man I just took a poll  And what did you think  About Slumdog Millionaire  And then you got 
[00:32:30]  My creep fans  You know the people  Over on this side  And that's why  I added the suck ass  Make a little edgy  Oh alright  I see  I could have put  Hated it  And then just went  Right to didn't see it  But I put suck ass  Well that  For the edgy  Opiated fans  That was good  Well now you got  139 votes  Robert  Oh no  And boy  The graph looks  Exactly the same  And Grit  At Green Guy  Writes  Boo  With a lot of O's  In the comments  He didn't like the movie 
[00:33:00]  So people can put comments  Do your poll  That was great  That's all I'm going to say  I saw the movie  And I just  I have my own opinion  Was it good  The movie was great  But it was  But you know what  This is what sucks  About movies in New York City  Is that you have to get there  On a movie like that  An hour  Or an hour and 20 minutes  Before the movie  To get a good seat  That's why I wait  A couple weeks  Let the crowds die down 
[00:33:30]  Why do I need to be  Well I probably need to  For the radio show  But in most cases  We get a nice screener copy  So we're on top of things  Yeah but in LA  They have movie theaters  Out there for people  Who want to spend  A little more money  Okay  And you get assigned seating  You can go on the internet  Pick your seat  Right  Where you want to sit  Where you feel comfortable  If it's available  You buy it  You spend more money  Wait they actually  You can pick your seat  In LA  Pick your seat  They don't have that  In New York  Do they  No  You don't go to the movies  Really but  No  I can pick my own seat 
[00:34:00]  Yeah  And  And  They don't have any  You know like  I went to see The Wrestler  I got tickets sold out  There was two seats  In the front row  But the front row  Was just a  You had to look up  At the ceiling  Your neck was  Yeah  Literally bent  All the way back  And it's  I don't know why  It should be illegal  To put the seats  Thank you  I don't know why  They still do that  No one enjoys those seats  Ever  I don't want to sit up front  Yeah but it's not even up front  They don't care about the movies  They just want their retinas burnt out  It's illegal  No  You know there's a movie theater 
[00:34:30]  In Huntington  It's an artsy theater  What is it called  The Huntington Art Cinema  You probably know that  Yeah  They have seats  Not only that are  I am not joking  When I tell you  Your knees hit the wall  That the screen is on  Okay  Not only do they sell those seats  They sell them all the way  To the corner  So you can actually have  A corner seat  Where your knees are  Hitting the wall  That the screen is on  Now you have to turn your head  Completely to the right  While you're still facing forward  And look straight up like this  It's awful 
[00:35:00]  And then you  And you're the dummy  That gets the last seat  In the theater  And that's the seat you get  And then you go back  To the box office  Like look  I want my money back  I'll come back  And see you another time  And they give you  A major hassle  It's like  Are you kidding me  It's like  Take those effing seats out  You have to fill out  These forms  And you did already  Watch half the movie  Right  Sure  Do you ever go see a movie  Like on vacation  On one of the islands  And it's like  Literally just a room  With a TV  And like some chairs  Like the movie theater  Is like an Aruba  It's just like  You go in  There's a TV  And they put cloth 
[00:35:30]  Around it  Right  I feel like  I'm at the movies  Just a bunch of  Flatbacks in there  With popcorn  So what was the deal  With Watchmen  I mean it made  A bloody fortune  Obviously  Of course it was  It was  The number one movie  In America  A 445 movie  I had to get there  At like 10 or 4  There was a line  Already formed  So you're waiting  In the line  To get in  Then we all got in  Everybody got seats  It was alright  Packed in  And then you have to wait  You know  45 minutes  For the movie to start  And then you have to wait  Another 30 minutes now 
[00:36:00]  With the  They had commercials  Previews  The previews don't even start  They have all these commercials  Then  With previews in there  And then they do  The whole preview thing  With that  So now you gotta wait  Around 10 more minutes  For all these previews  To happen  And then the movie starts  And the movie's 3 hours  So I was there  For 4 hours  Over 4 hours  That's putting in some time  Yeah that's not worth it  Dude I was just  No movie worth it  Did you vote on your tweet poll  That it was too long  I  Yeah what was your  What was your vote  I voted  Too long 
[00:36:30]  Too long  You know that's a good  You know that they  How long is the movie officially  I think it's like  Just under 3 hours  Just under 3 hours  2.40 I think  Yeah  They said that the movie  In the original cut  Was over 4  And that's what it's gonna be  On the DVD  On the DVD  Yeah  Cause they were really bummed out  That they had to cut out so much  The most fascinating  And they could kinda fit into  The time slot  That these movie theaters need  Two things happened  In this movie that blew me away  One  Doctor Manhattan  You know  Which I love  The fact 
[00:37:00]  And they should've did it  In the Hulk  Is they showed  His  The goods  The junk  They showed  And it was  Why do you need to see  Superhero junk  The Hulk  The only reason  Why I couldn't believe  The Hulk  Is cause  His shorts  Pants would grow  With him  It's stupid  Show me a green  Piece of meat  And I'll believe it  Dude  Obviously he's  Hung like a tiny  Little shrimp  Because he's on  All those roids  To make him look  Like the Hulk  Yeah it could happen  Too  You know what  Those roids do  When his  Yeah cause  Cause his pants 
[00:37:30]  Didn't really grow  His thighs did  Everything ripped off  The Hulk got huge  And the new one  The movie  Yeah yeah  He got so big  It was a giant thing  That the pants  Wouldn't stay up  Forget about it  No  And it didn't have  An elastic band  It was jeans  Why do you need  To see male junk  Cause it's like  It's a superhero  I gotta suspend reality  I can't  I look  Well why is his  Pants fit  Oh he can jump  Across and he gets  Green and big  So as soon as  You got to see  The male junk  You're like  Oh god  Thank you lord 
[00:38:00]  There's two reasons  For that  Yeah but  He had a nice  Piece too  Let me tell you  Oh they really  Let me tell you  And they actually  Got the swing  Like when you walk  What did it actually  Oh that's wonderful  The actual  You know  Just  I don't want to  Get too graphic  But they got it  They got it right  Let's put it that way  Where you saw it  You're like  Oh good  Well you were  Very happy with it  What you thought  They were going to  Make it move  Like an elephant's trunk  Just haphazardly  Like  Yeah I thought  It maybe had  Like rag doll  Graphics dynamic  That video games 
[00:38:30]  Have  A little swing  Yeah  A little swing  To it  Random  And you know  Everybody in the movie  Theater  As soon as that  Happened too  Whispers  Keith from Philly  Writes  R underscore Kelly  Is being a homoerotic  Douche right now  No  I understand  What you're saying  And I understand  Thanks for promoting  My Twitter  But  No I just like  The fact that  They didn't  Cover it  Yeah  Because I can't  Handle it  I can handle it  You could take it  But you were 
[00:39:00]  Very happy  That they decided  Not to cover it  No  I got you  He's naked  Alright Bobby  Now I don't have to  See  I'm with you Bobby  I don't have to  That's fun for everybody  That's good  Like in the Hulk  I didn't have to go  Oh come on  Really  His pants don't grow  His pants didn't rip off  Did it take you out  Of the movie  It took me out  For a couple minutes  And the other thing  That was really cool  About this movie  What's his name  Rorschach  You know  Who he is  Who  The guy who plays  Rorschach  In the movie  No  I don't know anything 
[00:39:30]  About Rorschach  Do you remember  Bad News Bear  Now this guy  First of all  He had one of the  Baddest lines  He was really badass  In the movie  Really good  But then when you  Find out who he is  In reality  You're like  Really  Like wow  Lupus  Do you remember  Loomis  No  Do you remember  Bad News Bears  Of course  Do you remember Kelly  Oh Kelly  Kelly Leach  Kelly  Kelly Leak  I think  Leak  Kelly  Kelly  Kelly  Has a huge part  In this movie  The guy was  Three feet tall 
[00:40:00]  How could he be  Dude he is  He's got one of the  Best lines in the movie  When he's in the prison  And like 50 guys  Want to kill him  And one guy attacks him  And he just throws  Hot oil in his face  And the guards  Grab him  He goes  You think  They got me  Caged in here with you  You're caged in here  With me  And the whole theater  Just erupted  Like wow  He's a badass  In this movie  Kelly Leak  I'm telling you  I'm telling you  He's the comeback kid  The last couple of years  He's been in some  A bunch of movies  And he's a badass 
[00:40:30]  Scary looking  Mother effer  Yeah I mean  Is he bald in this movie  Because there's a couple  Of movies that came out  He just like  Shaved down his head  And everything  No he's got his hair  But he's a small guy  Have you seen the latest  Pictures of him  No  He's a badass  I have no idea  What he looks like  He looks like a badass  I just picture him  Playing a little  Air hockey  Yeah I know  With that awful skin  With that awful skin  Trying to play air hockey  With a little  What's her face  Oh there it is  Second picture  And look  That's how he looks  For the most part nowadays  A goatee and a bald head 
[00:41:00]  There he is  That's the same badass  I can totally see  That that's him  Yeah see he would be  He does look like a prisoner  He would get some  Some good parts  Looking like that  He's like an ex-con  Yeah let's say  How to Kent the movie guy  He's good for one or two  Every week  What do you got Kent  What do you got on this watchman  Well it made  55.6 million dollars  This weekend  But according to some  Analysts  Some insiders  That's still not enough  Because Fox sued  If you guys remember  A couple months ago  About who would get  Distribution rights 
[00:41:30]  So basically  They didn't do any work  On the movie  Sued  And now they get  A third of the cut  So each studio  Is walking away  With way less money  Than they should be  So the movie  Is going to be  Considered a bomb  Which means  Less rated R  Comic book films  For studios  Thank God for lawyers  By the way  Yeah  It's fantastic  They know how to  Make everything good  They certainly do  Yeah but what about  DVD sales  What about the  International market  Come on  Blu-ray  This movie is going 
[00:42:00]  To be killer  There's a  They animated  A short film  That is a  Pirate story  That's in the comic books  It's kind of like  An allegory to what's  Going on  Inside the comic  Like one of the  Characters is actually  Reading a comic  That's almost  Narrating what's  Going on in the  Main story  So they animated  That it's coming  Out on DVD  This month  And Blu-ray  And then when  Watchmen comes out  On Blu-ray  That's going to get  Re-cut back into  The film along with  A lot of other  Stuff that got  Left out  So it's going to  Be really 
[00:42:30]  Really long  Like Lord of the  Ring  Yeah it's going to  Be big  Fans are digging it  I went to the  Midnight showing  And I haven't seen  That many people  Cheer at arms and  Legs breaking  In my entire life  Yeah it was pretty  Violent  Did you like it  Kent?  I really liked it  I liked how  Unforgiving a lot  Of parts are  It is not  People say  The Dark Knight  Was a dark movie  And it doesn't  Hold a candle  To how dark  This thing is  This movie is  So graphic and  Gory  People getting 
[00:43:00]  Turned inside out  Attempted rapes  The arms getting  Cut off  Sounds nice  Breaking  It is brutal  They have Dr. Manhattan  In Vietnam  They sent him  Oh yeah  They sent him  At the end  And he's just  I mean Anthony  Would love this part  He's just walking  Really slow  And you know  The Vietcana  Trying to run away  And he's just  Blowing them up  From the inside out  That's nice  The song from  What is it  Flight of the Valkyries  Is playing in the background  Oh really  He's a hundred feet tall 
[00:43:30]  Turning guys inside out  And their guts  Are just flying everywhere  That sounds great  And they just show  All of them  Bowing to him  It's about time  They bring that  That song back  Into the movies  It's been a while  That was my one  Biggest complaint  Was  Zack Snyder's  Never been very  I don't know  Subdued  With his directing  And a lot of  His musical choices  Bat you over the head  Like there's a funeral  So of course  The Sound of Silence 
[00:44:00]  Is playing  And the movie's  About the end of the world  So 99 Look Balloons  Plays at one point  And Leonard Cohen's  Then we take  Berlin is playing  All his musical choices  Are really  Really cool  You know Leonard Cohen  Stuff don't you  Of course  Right  Hey can I ask you  A question dude  Yeah go for it  When they showed  Dr. Manhattan  And they showed  He had his stuff  You know intact  Weren't you in your head  Like alright good  I'm glad they left that in  Instead of covering  You just can't get 
[00:44:30]  Enough of that  Can you  Let him answer  It is in the comics  And I mean  They're staying true to form  The whole movie  Is almost everything  From the page  But were you excited  When you saw it  Alright Bob  No I was  I was actually  Enough about the cock  Because I thought  I thought  Wow  I can't take it anymore  I can't  Shut up  We can put up  A poll poll  Yeah you  Yeah  That's  I'm going to put up  A poll right now  A poll

[00:49:00]  Care if there's cement in the basement  Yeah they do  I'd holy cement  I'd have somebody bless it  Holy cement  Okay  Now you're blessing the cement  Is that what the Amityville Horror House looks like now?  No  Wow  Unrecognizable  By the way  The horror is now  It's worth 20% less than it was  I bought it  That's the true horror  Could you help me out with Nick in New York?  Go ahead Nick  Nick  The movie was filmed in Tom's River, New Jersey  So? 
[00:49:30]  Yeah  The house  The house  Does not  It looks nothing like it did in the movie  It's kind of like almost a row house  The real house  Dude have you ever seen the real house?  That's the house where all the crap happened  Hey ask that  And that's why it's cool to go check it out  You idiot  Hey  And the house was in the news  Hey jackass  It doesn't look like it did in the movie  This guy is an idiot  It doesn't look like it did in the movie anymore  Hey dummy  Hey dummy  It never did  It never looked like that you're saying 
[00:50:00]  No it didn't have it's own yard  I know  It was very small  It was a lot small  That's what got people wondering why it didn't look like the house  But it had the quarter round windows  And it had the barn roof  It was the same house  But that was the house where the real killings happened  Thank you Ed  You stupid son of a bitch  You're talking about it being creepy  It's the creepiness out of the movie  No it's creepy because the real murders happened at the house 
[00:50:30]  I checked out as a stupid high school kid after a beer and a half of my buddies  Killed his family in a Long Island house  Not a Tom's River New Jersey house  Ass hat  Who gives a crap to use the house in Tom's River  That means nothing to me  Nothing  Nothing  Nothing  And then I also checked out the local bar where the guy went after the murders  And just sat down and had a few pops  Yes  You guys are dumbasses  You're the dumbass  Go screw 
[00:51:00]  Thank you  March 15th  All these points  140 Maverick Road  Amityville, New York  I'll be doing one show  One show only  8.30pm  For tickets  631-264  7712  That's if you want to see r underscore slash kelly dot org  No, no, no org  How about you make it easier for everybody  Hey, don't see Brock's Twitter  No one uses an underscore for their screen name  That's stupid  I'll change it for you, Opie  Change it  I'm going to change it  Opie and Ed  Only if they come and see me 
[00:51:30]  A big good morning to everybody  Hey, that daylight savings time  It's going to be good in a week or two  But the first few days  Just suck  You get used to one thing  Next thing you know  Your alarm's going off an hour earlier  I don't care what people say  No, not really  It's actually the time now  No, it's an hour earlier  For the first week or two  Yeah, that hour makes a difference  I woke up so goddamn late yesterday  And it was because of that hour 
[00:52:00]  I knew it was  Yeah  And then you go to bed  Like last night  You're like, do I go to bed?  What do I do?  I'm not really tired  But the clock says it's bedtime  What?  It's 12.30  Why can't we just keep the same time around  11.30  How about if we just keep the same time?  All year long  All year long  I don't know  Because I kind of like doing this  Because then it stays lighter out later  I do like that  And didn't we used to do this like later?  Like in April?  First week in April or something?  Yeah  They moved it up this much? 
[00:52:30]  They moved it up like three weeks now?  Yep  It's supposed to help the economy  Yeah, is it?  I have no idea  Sun's sort of coming out here in New York  But it looks like it's going to be a cloudy day  So  It's time to see  It was raining  It's time to see like  Grey clouds in between the buildings here in New York City  I'd rather have it cloudy  And not freezing  Everything that's hanging off  Nah  We're just about done  I think so  Yeah, we're going to get one big, huge, massive, over-the-top snowstorm  But then the next day it'll all just melt 
[00:53:00]  And then spring will officially be here  It does it that way every year  Puxataniope  Apparently  Do you want to bet?  No  Between now and  I can't afford to bet anymore  We'll get one huge blast  A ridiculous blast  But the next day it'll be completely gone  Like it never even happened  Yeah  That's how it is here in New York  Every year  That's how it is  I'm looking forward to the St. Paddy's Day party that we're throwing  What?  Yeah, where is it? 
[00:53:30]  At Connelly's?  Why don't we say  Oh boy, that's a bad time for that to happen  What the hell was that?  That was a broken CD player  That should have been our first clue  We've been bitching about that for months  And it never got fixed  What song was that?  Because you don't fix stuff for the guys  You're kicking to the curb  Something you take anal nitrate pop  And lay on your belly  And hope for the best  Dude, it gets a lot worse than that 
[00:54:00]  Try to just lie on your belly button  And that's the only part of your body  Touching the floor  Kick your feet straight up  And your neck back  As far as you can go  Hey, we've got a nice fun fact coming in from Jared in Boston  We love our fun facts  Yes, Jared, you've got a fun fact for us?  I sure do  Did you know that in countries that observe daylight savings time  For the first week that you roll your clock forward  There is a 5% increase in the rate of heart attacks 
[00:54:30]  Hey, how about that?  Why is that?  The lack of sleep  Added stress on the body  Hey, that's a fun little fact  I like that one  If you're at the point where you're teetering on an hour's sleep  As being the defining line between living and dying from a heart attack  Perhaps you ought to, you know, cut back on some of the red meat and smoking  Yeah, lay off on the ham  Yeah  Perhaps it's not our problem  Perhaps it's just not the hour 
[00:55:00]  Right, right  That's pretty  That's it, though  Imagine you're  Yeah, like you said  You're teetering on the fence and it's all just an hour  That's what it comes down to in the end  Let's say hi to Steve on Long Island  Steve  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey, Steve  Hello  Yeah, I live in Copac, one town over from Abneyville  We decided to go down Ocean Avenue one night  And see the Abneyville house  And something really weird happened when I pulled up  Yeah, what happened?  I got really tired 
[00:55:30]  So I decided to go get a cheeseburger  And then go home and go to sleep  Wow  Bobby, is Bobby in the studio?  Yeah  Of course he is  Bobby  Yeah, hi  What's up, dude?  Yeah  Oh, you got me  How needy are you?  As needy as they get  As needy as they get  Let's go to Chris  He's in a heart-shaped tub in the Poconos  Oh, enough about the tubs  Yeah  He hates the tubs  All right  You're in a champagne glass then 
[00:56:00]  Are you sick of the heart-shaped pubs  And the champagne  What is the champagne  The big champagne glass bubble bath  Yeah  I only work in this area  It sucks as is  All right  What do you got going on in the Poconos today, Chris?  Did you guys hear about the awful gift that Obama gave our biggest ally?  What?  The British Prime Minister, what?  Yeah, he just gave him a bunch of DVDs  That, you know, won't even play over there because they're not PAL  Yeah  What? 
[00:56:30]  He gave him DVDs?  He gave him a box of 25 DVDs of classic American films  That aren't even in the format that they play over there  They're for our region and not there  Oh, he gave him a couple of helicopter models of Marine One for Gordon Brown's kids, too  All right, I gotta be  What a cheap son of a bitch  Wait, I gotta be the stupid one here, though  DVD players don't work over there  They have a whole different format  Cameras  Everything  Cell phones  Why can't we all just at least do that together? 
[00:57:00]  Yeah  I mean, supposedly we're all heading toward the world as one  But we can't even figure out the DVDs?  We're supposed to figure out the economies of all these nations?  Yeah, they code the DVDs to different regions  The tapes used to be NTSC and then PAL format  NTSC, and then, yeah, we use that and they use PAL  And the video cameras, they're PAL, right?  The video cameras are PAL  Yeah, it's different  Ours are 30 frames per second  Theirs like 20, what's it, 25?  Yeah, I bought one of those, a video camera from, you know, those shops in New York when I first moved here 
[00:57:30]  Oh, hey  You walk up to the window, you're like, the electrical heaven  Oh, that's real  Those are the worst places to buy idiot things  I walked in, yeah, I was an idiot, I just was like two days here  And I was like, oh my God  I walked in, and first of all, the one I wanted, he, yeah, we got it, we got it  I waited an hour and a half, and I gave him the cash  I go, here's the thousand cash, whatever the hell it was  And he goes, yeah, he goes, no, we have this other one  They gave me an English camera  And he meant PAL, P-A-L 
[00:58:00]  Can I give a tip to everybody that's going to come to New York, the tours out there  If you find yourself between 30th Street and, let's give it, 60th Street  Yeah  Do not buy any electronics  No  That's a large area, but Times Square especially, you're crazy  You're absolutely nuts  How do they stay open, though? The rent must be ridiculous  You know what it is?  You know why? Because they're selling $200 cameras for $1,000  A Rube comes in and buys it every so often 
[00:58:30]  We'll buy something instead of going to a good place  Like, what's the place we usually go to, B&H?  Yeah, B&H  Well, that's in that area, I guess, but it's sort of to the west  B&H is the best  It's outside  Just a bunch of Hasidic Jews with Palestinians, with Arabs  There's a couple of Arabs  They're working together  Together on the one roof, and they're not open on Saturdays  Don't go down Saturdays  No, the Sabbath  That's the Sabbath  They're not open on the Sabbath  On Jesus' day, they're open all day 
[00:59:00]  There's all kinds of rules on their website  We will not be open between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. on such and such a day  Well, they have to be home before the sun goes down  I was in there once as it was getting close  And man, you could see the panic  It starts sinking in  They turn to dust  Oh, yeah  They have one of the most efficient methods  You walk in, you point out what you want  And then they give you a little ticket  And you go up to this  And it comes down in a conveyor belt  So from somewhere  Yeah  There's conveyor belts everywhere 
[00:59:30]  From somewhere  Who knows where  But there's your thing  Because they understand  People are going to try to rip you off  So guess what?  You can't touch the merchandise  It's all in glass cases  Until you buy it  And all of a sudden  Conveyor belt above your head  Here it comes  Yep  But the only thing that stinks about B&H  If you want to return something  You better have every little elastic  Of course  Every little twisty tie  Really?  I went to return a camera  You're missing a plastic bag that the remote came in  You have to go around the corner  Around the side  There's a door  Returns, it says 
[01:00:00]  There's four of the oldest Hasidic Jews  Yeah  That hate life  And you walk up  And they go through it  And they have their glasses  Hanging on the edge of their nose  That's where the old gristly ones hang out  Oh, God  The ones that are just too nasty  To work the floor  They go through  They actually go through the manual  Really?  And they go through every little thing  Where is this?  There was tape that closed this 
[01:00:30]  Where is this now?  You cut the tape?  You're missing a staple  From the box?  It's a staple  Can I please?  You pinched the styrofoam  And it has a pinch mark out of it  But boy, they really are pretty good  Oh, they're the best  I never had to take anything back  So, yeah  And they'll sit and talk to you forever  About everything  Because they'll explain  Why you should buy this instead of that 
[01:01:00]  They're really good at that  Speedwards, really fast  I went to the Jim Jefferies HBO taping on Saturday  How'd they go?  Well, we're staying in the same subject here  Trust me  After the show  Ten Hasidic Jews going  We're the Hasidic Jew community  There's a lot of us that listen to the Opie and Anthony show  Surprisingly  Really?  I know you're surprised  But yes, you have a lot of fans in the Hasidic  Muzzletop  In the Hasidic community  Wonderful  And then they go  And we hate David 
[01:01:30]  Because he gets everything wrong  Wrong  About our faith  He's the worst Jew  Really?  Yes  Because he just is not knowledgeable about Judaism  Why don't you have a Jew off?  But they are out there listening  Why don't you make a Jew poll on your Twitter?  Yeah  A Jew poll  David, that doesn't mean we want you on the air  I'm sorry, buddy  No, why don't you push yourself right back out?  Let me tell you something  The first second I walked into the office this morning  And sat down  Yeah  I heard David's voice  Yeah  And I turned to Travis and went 
[01:02:00]  I cannot take that voice this early  Like that  He was just talking about something with the whiny voice  It's like, I can't take this  Yeah  Leave  Let's go to Stryker  Stryker  Stryker?  Good morning  Good morning, Stryker  Good morning, Stryker  Speaking of B&H  I ordered a GPS from their website  And everything was fine  Except they sent the wrong  I ordered a second power cord for it 
[01:02:30]  And they sent the wrong one  Boy  I tried to return it  Now, I'm in Colorado  They're in New York  It should be a simple transaction  To pick up the phone and call them  And request an RMA to return it  It cost me more in freight charges  To return it than it did originally  Because I had to return it  They shipped it back  Because I forgot one number on the RMA  They shipped it back to me 
[01:03:00]  Oh, you're done at that point  I had to write the number down again  Ship it to them  And then when I shipped it to them the second time  I actually got a phone call from them  Saying, oh, you forgot something else  No, it wasn't collect  Oh, okay  That's a good line, though  You know what it is?  Their shipping hub is Jerusalem  So everything has to go through there  But I've got to say, though  Other than that  You're right  I mean  They had everything  And, you know, it's true 
[01:03:30]  What they say about Jews and pennies  Because the pricing  What?  So low  Oh, yeah  Well, it really is  For a place, especially in Manhattan  Their online sales are national  But, yeah  We're doing a commercial for B&H  They're always the lowest  Hey, they do a good job  What are you going to do?  They're always the lowest  You got places that suck a big one out there  You know  You might as well give a little credit  Thanks, Stryker  Hey, Bobby  Just wanted to let you know  I'm looking forward to seeing you here in Denver in June  Oh, I'll see you there 
[01:04:00]  Go up and say hi  Well, give me a hug  Yeah, I saw Petriki  Saw Petriki over the weekend  And effing hilarious  Oh, good  Yeah, he's funny  He's doing his whole relationship show now  And it just had the place rolling  Yeah, he's the man  Absolutely  Until you snap too many pictures of him  And he gets mad  And chases you out of the theater  Chases?  That was a, you know  Rrrr joke  That was a little joke  Oh, geez  Sorry, well  Those chains are high-tensile steel

[01:05:30]  And ate the cell phone  She's not that big  She doesn't care, though  I know she doesn't care  Does that frustrate you  That she doesn't care?  I'll make her care  You know why?

But everyone else was laughing

[01:46:30]  It annoys everybody  I love that  Stay still  Stay still  Iraq  His vision is based on movement  So just don't move  That's mean  Iraq  He's losing weight  Bite a lawyer in half  That's sitting on the crapper  He's always staring at me for  Like he's going to attack me  Focusing on you  Ignoring the rest  Alright  Very good  Iraq you want Anthony  You should do that with a salad  You want Anthony  No I gave up on that  He gave up on that 
[01:47:00]  He tried though  Did you even know  I was never on your hero list  But he did all these nice little things  For you over the years  What  And you never really  Acknowledged it  I don't know of any  I'm not saying Iraq's ever done  Anything bad to me  But as far as nice things go  I don't remember anything  He sent me a few blurry  Celebrity pictures  Which was nice  Tell him all the nice stuff  Blurry celebrity photos  Because you never ask  For celebrity photos  But every time  You make sure  I'm there with the camera 
[01:47:30]  To take your celebrity photos  Yeah whenever I want  One taken  I say Iraq  When you're snapping them off  I go Iraq  Could you take a picture  Well if you didn't like them  Stop asking me then  But Jimmy  Who takes great pictures  Is usually in the picture  Or having his picture taken  Oh that is true  Why don't you just  Steady your hand a little bit  No it's  I have a bad luck with cameras  Is that what it is  You have a bad luck with cameras  But I just felt a little  You know  Jilted that I wasn't  On your hero list  It was never intentional  Wow we're finally getting this out 
[01:48:00]  Three years later  It was never intentional  Nor was  Most of those lists completed  Because as soon as  That got called on the air  Everything got deleted  He was part of another list  Yeah  Huh  The a-hole list  No  So Iraq  I heard from you  I told Ant  Who'd you tell Ant  Anyone good  Uh  No  Not really  I keep my mouth shut  And just  Alright  Skip through life  With my shoelaces untied 
[01:48:30]  Iraq what do you know  About our big broadcast  At Connelly's  I don't know  Probably just as much  As the  The actual bar  That's supposed to be  Hosting  This event  Oh you called them  They said we're gonna be there  Really  When you  You called them yesterday  Um  Maybe a little bit earlier  Ah and what was the uh  Uh  They weren't sure  Had they heard from anyone  Besides you  That they didn't say  But uh  When  When it was asked  You know  What's the information  For the broadcast  Yeah  Um  Will Opie and Anthony 
[01:49:00]  Be there  Will 2U still be there  They weren't sure  Was the answer  That I received  On the phone  Ah see  So they're getting info  From somebody then  When was that  Uh  This might have been  This might uh  This was Saturday afternoon  About 4 o'clock  We're still on their website  I thought I heard  From Stuntbring  Didn't you tell me  Stunty  That um  That this gig  Was uh  Off  I have no confirmation  But Iraq was saying 
[01:49:30]  Just spill the beans  You're too old for CHR  Will you say something  I don't know  I've been told  The same thing  You've been told  He does know something  You can see  No I don't  I heard from Iraq  So you heard from Iraq  That the gig was cancelled  Down at the Irish  There was a call made to  The satellite place  Right  That they needed to do something  Oh right right  That's where I heard  Some info also  Oh why is Iraq  Getting mad  And shaking his head  What's the matter Iraq  Iraq  He didn't say it was confidential  Nothing  Use your head  Stuntbring  Oh so that was confidential info 
[01:50:00]  Wow  Oops  Was it  Who knows what's confidential anymore  I was ready to say the same thing  To tell you the truth  Yeah Iraq  Alright well  Since uh  This is going to be the case  Hey CBS  Why did your sponsor  Call our other company  And ask them repeatedly  Can you salvage this broadcast  Because it seems CBS  Doesn't want to have anything  To do with this anymore  Oh my god  Iraq  There you go  How dare you  Answer that  That's confidential information  Really  Why are you calling out CBS 
[01:50:30]  That's insane  Why are you burning a bridge  Who's CBS  Isn't it really just made up of people  It's not  So  Yes  It's not for the time being  Alright so maybe the broadcast  Was cancelled  That's no big deal right  Yeah  I'm sure that's uh  That's the only thing happening  Is it the only thing happening  Iraq  Iraq  You're the like  You started the whole rumor thing  Like you were the one  That went to Opie with  I heard from this one  That this is happening 
[01:51:00]  Very reliable sources  Very reliable sources  Are saying what  Uh  That's the 100  Because they're a little worried  About the  CHR thing right  Yeah  Two douchey stations  Fighting over the pop  The pop music audio  Maybe a concert too  That's new info  Oh really a concert  Maybe  Something that doesn't quite fit  The um  The  Yeah  Rocking thing  Yeah  Miley Cyrus 
[01:51:30]  Rock moving  I don't know  This will be hilarious  If they decide to keep us  And then they have to  Get rid of  Iraq for bed  Mouthing the company  Oh man  Will I laugh my ass off  You know  What's the concert announcement  Yeah what is it  That I'm not sure  No you're not  You're not sure  But you've heard something  What did you hear  That I don't know  Come on  Iraq  What did you hear man  That I don't know  You do know  No  I think enough  Has been said already 
[01:52:00]  There's no doubt  You know  So  Oh wow  There's no doubt  You know  So  Gwen are you going to tell us  What  I can look in your eyes  There's no doubt  That you know something  No I have no idea  What you're talking about  It's Stefanoli  Here at this station  Stunt brain  When did you stop  Wearing your wig  When did you take  Your wig off  So what do you know 
[01:52:30]  We rock  What have you been here  What's the word on the street  Yeah what's the word on the street  We used to ask her all that  All the time  And half the time  He was wrong  But it was always fun  To ask him  Did someone tell you  Don't speak  Yeah  What's going on  Yeah  I think we need to take a break  Look at him  He's freaking out  You're sweating  Like crazy 
[01:53:00]  That's good for you  You'll lose a few pounds  Now let's go  What do you know  You're in the hot seat  Well  There might be  Something to do  With  With a concert  That  Maybe two sides  Are fighting over  Oh  I thought of that one too  Travis  You dummy  If it was you out here 
[01:53:30]  I'd use it  Who knows  Was it an AIDS joke  Close  Oh  Yeah  Why can't you just spit it out  There's nothing to spit out  I don't know 100% yet  So why can't you spit out  Like 85% of it  Because that would be  Giving out incorrect information  Yeah but you can always  Apologize and give the  Correct information later  What was  What did you hear about  The broadcast though  And Guinness and all that  Because they really needed us  To do this live broadcast  That's what I want to  Stick with here 
[01:54:00]  So  Is it cancelled  Because no one has told us  It's cancelled  We would be the first to know  And then we would tell  Everybody else  You'd think that  But  It seems all sides  Are  Signs are pointing to  That  This may not happen  What  This live broadcast  The one we're supposed to do  Yeah  Yeah  Well that's what I figured  Anyway  You're not  You're not a CHR guy either  Shut up  What do you know  What do you know  What do you think  You're salvaging something

Thanks man  I'm back over here  They changed mics up  I think  Yeah  Well was it poo or not?  Smells like African gum disease 
[02:03:00]  With this microphone  I think it was  It looked like doggy duty  Dude you know what it was  Is that it hardened  Over the last couple days  But  Don't smell it  Taste it  Taste it  Oh my god  I'm going to throw up  Taste it  Just sniffing it  Kind of smells like  What?  A dog bone?  Like poo  I had to stick  My dog swallowed a piece of chocolate  Yeah  Last week  They don't like chocolate  They'll die  A dog will die  I mean they like it  But they don't understand  They're not supposed to eat it 
[02:03:30]  They'll die  No no no  It's a fact  You get two hours  I googled it  And I called the vet  You get two hours  Before it goes into its intestines  The antidote into them  No you have to  You have to get it out of them  If you bring them to the vet  They make them puke  And they have to give them some stuff  I stuck my whole arm  Down my dog's throat  And what?  Pulled out the chocolate?  No I stuck it down there  And I just started wiggling stuff  And then I slowly dragged it back out  And it threw up  Just a ball of chocolate 
[02:04:00]  With phlegm  What?  I saved my dog's life  You did not  I swear to God  I called the vet  They complimented me  Season Milan sent me a letter  Over the weekend  Let's say hi to Jason in New Jersey  Jason how are you buddy?  Good evening  Good evening Jason  How are you?  I'm good  I would just like to thank the both of you  For having to scrape one more bumper sticker off my car  I just leave it there  Until the next letters are on it  Your bumper sticker should be on Magnus  At this point I can't even keep track of the Opie and Anthony bumper stickers 
[02:04:30]  I walk around New York  I'm like that was like four years  That was two years ago  That was another city  That's another city  That now they live here  It's very confusing  Thanks for taking my call  I'll see you guys on Tuesday  Oh never mind  Punch it up  Bye  Let's say hi to Sean in Georgia  Sean how are you buddy?  Hey Opie  Hey are you guys still going to be able to be heard on Sirius XM Radio  Which you can also get a just online account and still listen to from work?  Yeah I guess we still do that  That dig right?  I wouldn't sit here and mention it 
[02:05:00]  No  But since you brought it up  Since you brought it up  Alright alright  Well just checking to make sure that Sirius XM at Sirius.com or XMradio.com is still available for everybody  Yeah because they've never seemed to mind somebody plugging a satellite radio  Let's go somewhere  Alright Sir  Let's go to Jody and Fishkill  Fishkill  Yeah um  I just wanted to say  It's Fishkill  Yeah it means like  I don't know 
[02:05:30]  Ah who cares  And he knows what it means  Yeah  Ah bite me  It's a place where fish are  Oh dude you want to yell at her?  It doesn't actually mean kill the fish  It's Fishkill  It's where fish are  No  Um  Bobby you're full of crap when you say that you saved your dog's life  My dog ate 19 truffles on Valentine's Day  He was only 30 pounds and he lived  We didn't do anything  He didn't even have diarrhea  Well why do I have to be full of crap?  Maybe it's the internet and the vet was full of crap  I hope your dog dies now  How's that sound?  Urban legend 
[02:06:00]  Yeah I hope your mom dies  Really?  She is dead  Oh really?  Good  Sorry to hear that Bobby  Sorry thanks Opie  Hey uh  Go ahead you fat cow  What happened?  Jody  Every time we talk about the chocolate and the dog thing  Veterinarians start calling like crazy and say  It's a fact  Look  Tell your listeners the chocolate and the dog thing is not good  It's not good  It's not good but it ain't gonna kill him  It's not good for dogs  It's not good for dogs  It's not good  But if my dog ate 19 truffles  How do you know he ate 19? 
[02:06:30]  How do you know it wasn't you sleep eating?  What's sleep eating?  Because it was in the fucking box  Watch him  Oh  Oh  Oh  This isn't XM  It soon will be  Oh  That can't be true  What?  It is  It doesn't kill your dog  I'm sure if your dog ate  Your dog  This is what happens  It gets into your dog's intestines  It will get either very sick  Or it can actually go into a coma and die  Stalker Patty 
[02:07:00]  Hi is this really her?  I don't think it is  Patty  Hey  Hi it's Patty  It's not Stalker Patty  Oh okay  Just another Patty  Stalker Patty  She sounds kind of like  Travis  You know what I'm with Travis though  I hear a little Stalker Patty in her voice  But it's just a Patty  What's up Patty?  Patty?  Oh don't tell me I sound like Stalker Patty  A little bit  A little bit  The voice is deeper though  Okay  Well whatever  I just wanted to say  I really don't think Anthony has any respect for women  I don't think he likes women 
[02:07:30]  Why is that?  Because either that or you have absolutely no class  You break up with somebody that should be the end of it  I don't see why you have to tear them apart on the radio  That's true  I just think it's class  Yeah one of you and Lady Truck  Wait wait  Hold on  Hold on  Patty  What are you talking about  What the Jill situation?  Yeah  I'm talking about a couple of situations  Like your ex-mother-in-law  Yeah  Your ex-wife  Uh huh  You know the Jill situation 
[02:08:00]  Alright  Do you understand that  I come on the radio  And I talk about my life  No no  I talk on the radio  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  I should have  I should have cleared that up  I was wondering  On the bottom of your shoe  I understand  Your last name's spelled like that  But I didn't think you figured that  And I talk about my life  And what has happened in it  Honestly  And as openly as I can  And if somebody is a bitch  I'm going to call them out as being a bitch  If someone is a conniving piece of crap 
[02:08:30]  Well I would say that  But I wouldn't know where you go  You know  Why?  Like the bed sheets and stuff  I think it's low class  Well what was more  You know it makes you come off like a jerk really  You know what though  I told the story of what happened before that  And uh  There were things going on where  Perhaps even what I did  Wasn't all that bad  Compared to what other people did  I talked about a relationship  Two people  What am I  Mr. Perfect  Over here 
[02:09:00]  I can't break up with somebody  And trash him  Who am I?  No I don't think  I think you could trash him  Because I would do the same thing  But I just wouldn't go where you go  He goes  You know there's like certain limits  That like now  Like you're in the area  Where it makes you like  You know like  I would just have more class about it  So what  Don't say it's not  The class thing has nothing to do with it  Because  It's just how  I feel like a sore loser  A sore loser  You know  Don't shake your head Opie  Oh sorry 
[02:09:30]  Opie's nodding  Well she has  Good for Opie  She has a point though  She's trying to just tell you  That sometimes  Sometimes  Sometimes you take it a little too far  A little bit  She's trying to help you out  A little bit  I hate the high road  I don't  The high road is a good road to take  You know the high road  You could just fall further  From the high road lady  Let me tell you that  I like the low road  And I like the old dirt road  Let me tell you about that one  Hey  Why is this  Are you saying  I have  I think you're a riot  I really do  Why do you say  I have no respect  And don't like women 
[02:10:00]  Because  What  There's not one woman  That you've ever talked about  On the radio  That like  In a loving way  Yeah  Not even in a loving way  But like  It didn't work  You know  It wasn't her fault  It wasn't mine  Oh really  Really  What about my last  Long term relationship  That I had  That I  Don't bash  Melinda  What about her  Have I ever gotten on the air  And bashed her  I don't know  I bash her 
[02:10:30]  I bash her  Of a mother  But not  Her  Oh  Yo  You don't know about those  Because you don't hear about them  Exactly my point  You're saying  I bash them all  Except for the ones  You don't hear about  What a  What a tidbit of logic  That is Patty  You know  Good point by Anthony  There Patty  Point to Anthony  Anthony was with  With his ex there  For a long time  And never came on the air  And bashed her  After the fact  I don't bash her  Because you know why  Because there really  Isn't anything to bash there  We just 
[02:11:00]  After years of  Being together  And going out  We didn't  Get along  And that was  And that was that  And Anthony's  A really good boyfriend  He's monogamous  When he's with a girl  He's with that girl  For a while  He's not out there  Doing a lot of stuff  He's probably one of the  Nicest guys I know  With the chick  It's almost sickening  Sickening  I go on a date  Scott from Louisiana  What  I go on  Don't do it on dates  Because I go  If I go on a date  And it's like the first time  And the guy's like  My ex-wife was a jerk off  My ex-girlfriend was a bitch 
[02:11:30]  Do you think I do that  On a date  Do you think all I do  Is bash  Exes on my  On dates with a girl  Are you insane  Well I don't know  Yes you don't know  Again you don't know  This is a radio  But this is  My job  Is to be an idiot  My job  Is to be like this  What  You're doing a great job  Thank you  Yeah  But when  Do you  Do you understand  Do you understand  When I'm with 
[02:12:00]  People  Girls  Or  Or  Friends  I bash the listeners  Like you  I don't bash  Girlfriends  For the most part  Some I do  I bash my  Ex-wife  To people  I just go with that  Jill  Nick  Whatever  Yeah  Yeah  Really too far  Well that was  That was too far  When she  Then poured gasoline  On a girl's clothing  And valuables  And passport  And lit them on fire  In my backyard  Stole my pistol permit 
[02:12:30]  A laptop computer  What  She was an asshole too  But they used to go there  Why not  Wait wait Patty  I gotta stick up for it  I know  I've known it  For a long time  And if Jill  Didn't do what she did  I don't think  I would've talked bad  About her  No  I would've just  Hey it didn't work  Whatever  Bye bye  That's it  But when I had to go  I had to  Bite my lip  And plaster a smile  On my face  So I could get my  Permit back  And other  Things  And then I had to pay 
[02:13:00]  I had to pay  I forgot how much  Money it was  Keith remembers  500  I don't know where he is  Like 500 dollars  To get dry cleaning out  You have such bare relationships  No I've had  She's been divorced  Hey you're divorced  Let me tell you something Patty  Let me be honest with you  Since I was  Probably in my mid 20's  I was monogamously  With three girls  Up until a year ago 
[02:13:30]  Fag  So  How does  How does that grab you  How is that for woman hatred  And  When my relationships  Don't work  I was in long term relationships  How about you Patty  Let me hear your story  Just a little bit  Who are you with right now  Where's your husband  Well I have a boyfriend  Where's your husband though  We're divorced  Of course you are  You know why  He didn't want kids  And I did  So  What  He didn't want kids 
[02:14:00]  I wanted kids  To date  Non-negotiable  What  Non-negotiable  And we're still best friends  I mean I would never  Even you know  Like even dates I go on  You know  So like  Yeah  But we're still good friends  I wouldn't have married a jerk off  Oh god  You know that  Well no one  No one goes  No one goes  And says  You know what  I'm going to go marry a jerk off  It just happens  It happens  And I have to stick up for Anthony again  Anthony was married for a very long time 
[02:14:30]  To someone  I stuck it out  And he stuck it out  He was miserable  And trust me  There were temptations  All over the god damn place  There certainly was  And besides the underage girl  That he made out with  At an event up there  In Boston  Oh right  And blew off the skinny dipping  Yes  He was a very faithful person  Was she underage?  Well maybe underage drinking wise  I don't know  But there was nothing  Other than making out  With a mouth full of braces  A mouth full of braces  That was pretty fun 
[02:15:00]  Smelled like lollipops  She smelled like  Cotton candy and homework  But Anthony  Anthony was the good guy  Through his marriage  That really wasn't working out  Right up until the end  Okay that is the biggest turn off  Like you go out  With these guys  And they start trashing  Everyone they were with  And I'm like  Well these are the girls you picked  Do you think  I trash everyone I'm with though?  But how many guys  Are you dating?  Do you think I got  When I'm hanging out  But you don't talk about  The good ones  I guess you just talk about  The bad ones  And that's what we care 
[02:15:30]  Exactly  Because it's a radio show  And that's what I do  But do you think  When I'm alone with a girl  I sit there and just  Bad mouth other girls  Some guys do  I know but why  Why are you calling me  And saying I have no respect  For women  I know some guys do  I've seen those stupid  Dating shows  Where the guy sits down  And he's bashing  As well  Why do you want to  Talk about that  Pull your pants down  Alright guys  I hope you stay on  I do love you  But  I hate you  Hey  Because I hate all women 
[02:16:00]  Right  I think she was  I'm misogynistic  I think she was  A pretty good phone call  If you met me  You'd love me  I would  I don't know  Everyone loves me  No one likes you  Wait a minute  Everyone loves me  Even people that  Have left me  Love me  Oh God  Patty how old are you?  Oh shit  I've just turned 50  How many dogs  Do you have?  How many cats?  I have one  Exactly  Anthony  She's 50  You're 50 years old?

Nothing sexier than  An old squirt of  Vagisil beforehand  Oh God  Anthony  What did she do?  What?  You're wrong  I'm just saying  Oh stop it  I walk my dog  I swear to God  Cards are stopping  I can't even watch  Because they don't know  Which one is the dog  Someone had to say

[03:00:00]  OP and Anthony show  We got Larry the cable guy  In studio  We are live by the way  It's Monday  March 9th I guess  Right  March 9th  I do believe  It's a rainy  Shitty day here in New York  And  I was  I was  What are you doing  What are you doing  What's that  Something good  Show me a picture  Of his huge cock  Yeah see  Ah it's fucking huge  Let me see  I know it's not a cock picture 
[03:00:30]  Now turn around  No you didn't see that  Obviously I didn't give you that picture  That's fucking great  I was helping Bobby out  Robert Kelly's in studio  With Larry the cable guy  I'll just shut up  Let me know when you're ready  To do a radio show  Why talk  If I'm gonna like  I don't like that  You just took your ball home  I'm sorry  That was my fault  I'll wait  I don't care  No I'm sorry  I don't give a shit  I'm waiting for 11 o'clock  And I'm getting the fuck out of here  I don't give a fuck  I like to see  I like to see  You think I give a fuck today  What you guys spend your millions on 
[03:01:00]  Huh  As I have a  42 inch plasma  Stuff  Well Ant was showing you  His home theater  But see  That's  If you're staring at something  You should let the people know  And then you know  And then everyone's involved  A little bit  A little bit  A little bit  Pretty impressive home theater  Right  That's pretty  Yeah pretty fucking wild  That actually looks like a theater  He doesn't know how  He's gonna pay for it now  But I mean  It's still impressive  That's how you fucking  Live in this country though  You're just  Massive debt  And then you're forgiven for it  Obama  Obama's gonna give me money 
[03:01:30]  For everything  Right  Hello credit cards  You can get a bailout on that  Theater  Yeah yeah  You're gonna bail  I'm gonna say  It's a movie theater company  And even though it's in my house  I'm just gonna have to have  A couple of people  Line up outside my door  To make it look legit  How funny is it  If you gotta bail out  I want a bailout  From Obama  You know the three big automakers  Got 15 billion dollars  And today  The makers of Saturn  Said they just need  A couple hundred bucks  Till Thursday  That's it huh  How do car companies fail 
[03:02:00]  That is like  What the fuck's going on out there  Yeah  I think the price of gas  Kind of got to them  That people weren't buying  And they weren't ready  With you know  Smaller cars on their lots  They have the big SUVs  But I mean  How do you lose  Like billions of dollars though  Like  That's how they do it  I don't  Like  How does it get to that point  But how does it get to that point  Retard you're managing  Amazing  Yeah the managers  Of all these things  That's what we were talking  About earlier too  Not just radio  But everything  The management  Doesn't seem to lose the jobs 
[03:02:30]  It's everyone else  Until they don't have  Anything  For the managers  To manage  So they just  Stand around  Under the desk  Doing the duck and cover thing  Duck and cover Billy  Yeah  Here comes your pink slip  Right  But they haven't even  Gotten down to management yet  Where they start  Throwing them out the door  Because that's going to be  Fun to watch  They blame everybody else  And then they get new people in  And then they blame the new people  For a lot cheaper  And they get rid of them  And then they blame the new people  That replace the new people  That replace the other guys  And it just goes round and round 
[03:03:00]  That's how it works  So Larry the Cable Guy is in studio  And I was trying to  That's why I was a little mad Bobby  Because I was trying to pump you up  To Larry the Cable Guy  Like he thought you sold  T-shirts or something  No he actually asked me  He goes  Hey what's up  What's up dude  Nice to meet you Larry  He goes  Yeah what do you do  I go  Insurance  I sell insurance  And he didn't even blink  He was like  Oh that's a great job  And then I told him  To go fuck himself  And then he was like  I'm sorry  And then I fell past  He goes  I'm sorry  I just don't know you  But then I apologized 
[03:03:30]  Because it's not his fault  That he doesn't know me  It's my fault  That I have a shitty career  But I did  But I did think to myself  That's a funny insurance guy  Right  He ought to be a comedian  No but I apologized  Because I told him  I said man  I apologize  I don't get to New York  You know  But literally  I mean  I've been touring  With two opening  I had an opening at first  For the last five years  I had an opening at  For two and a half years  I've had another opening at  For two and a half years  And he's about to go  And then I'm going to get another  Open at  Why is he about to go 
[03:04:00]  Well I'd keep him  For about two and a half years  Each  Because then you start  Repeating everything  I hope Dane's not listening  Can you play to the deep south there  No  They would  You know what  Not that  They would love him  I'm not shoe warning you  Trust me  I know you're playing everywhere  But  No my first five minutes  I'd be good for five minutes  And then all of a sudden  I was in Nashville  Every night I had some lady  Some dyed blonde haired lady  With tight jeans  And a rodeo shirt  Yelling at me  Telling me I was just 
[03:04:30]  I was a hunk  I was Satan  And I was a hunk of shit  I was fighting every night  Speaking of comedians  We haven't talked about it yet  Maybe we can get him on the phone  Rich Voss  I don't know if you know this  But got in a huge fight  With one of  Oh yeah  What the fuck  I heard a story about that  But I didn't hear  You know Rich Voss right  Yeah  You know Rich Voss  And you don't know me  No I don't  You know  That's actually more of an insult  No I know  I never met Rich Voss  I know Rich Voss  Because I  Because he's been around  For 60 years  I remember him  Because he was on  The last comic standing  Ah see  See  I saw two episodes of that 
[03:05:00]  I saw the one with Alfie May  And the one with Rich Voss  Alright  Where Richie's just  Dying the whole time  I like that  We gotta start calling him Richie  Richie Voss  But that's what I was saying  That's what I was saying  Him though  And then before I did that  I was just with Ron, Bill, and Jeff  So I really don't  You know  Yeah but you know Rich Voss  That really hurts him  That really hurts everybody listening  You're doing great so far  Larry  That hurts all the people in there  Look at how depressed  They're all sad  You know what  I'm gonna take you to Nashville  With me  I'm coming  I'm coming  Can I read any redneck jokes there 
[03:05:30]  Do I have any  No I have no redneck jokes  Not a warning  I work up in Boston  And upstate New York  And Connecticut  I fucking love his accent  I fucking want to pinch his cheeks  I'm a thorn  I'm a thorn  That's what I'm saying though  Yeah but if you talk like that  You get a lot more gigs in this country  All I need is a fucking people  You get a lot more gigs  You understand like  Oh you need a people  I'm a white Catholic  Irish Catholic guy  Okay  I have  There's nobody  Yeah  Irish people  White people don't follow  Their white people 
[03:06:00]  They don't support their people  Rednecks support  Rednecks  Blacks support  Blacks  He's more than a redneck comic  Well you know  But you know what I'm saying  You just don't have the right uniform  I should get a hood  He's blue collar  Let me  I'm just preaching the wrong jokes  All right  Let me  Let me just come call  For a small moment  That would be fantastic  If he really talked about it  If he was French  I'm actually from Manchester  He's sort of one of us too  He did a lot of radio  Coming up  A lot of radio  Hundreds of stations 
[03:06:30]  That's when I first heard of him  No that's what he was telling me  He would wake up  And he would have to call  A list of radio stations  Every morning right  And make believe  You were on that station  For real  Yeah pretty much  I had 27 total  But I remember when I was going in  You know when I  When I wasn't doing stand up  They asked me to come in  And be a sidekick in Orlando  At the rock station in Orlando  And I'd show up  I'd go in here  And I'd be in here  About 20 minutes  I'd go  And I'd be like  I gotta call  I'll be right back  And I'd go in the other room  And I'd call five stations  I'd come back in  And do about another 25 minutes 
[03:07:00]  Go back in  Dude I did that for about 13 years  There was a lot of guys  Like Larry man  You're living  You get a character going  And then these radio stations  Because they don't do  Any of their own material  So they hire guys like Larry  Which is good for Larry  Yeah well yeah  And all of a sudden  And it makes them  And then the morning show  It sounds like  It was their creation  And nothing to do with it  The thing I learned about it  Is everybody could use  Something funny  For three minutes  Sorry  What happened  You've been out of the conversation  Something going on over there  This mic windscreen 
[03:07:30]  Smells like vomit  It smells like  That's where the great Ronnie  Vomit  That's where the great Ronnie B sits  Well I don't know who else  Is sitting here  I think it was Dave  Can I smell it  Dave was sitting there  Dave was sitting there  Dave sits there too  Is there where Ronnie B sits  Ronnie B  Ronnie B  Tell me he is not  One of the funniest dudes  On the list  Ron Bennington is God  Dude he's like  The funniest guy  On the planet  He used to do his club right  Yeah all the time  I still think he is  The funniest guy  Yep  In the 
[03:08:00]  In the quickest  The funniest  Yeah he'll come up  With shit off the wall  Like he's  Everything from  Like he's a 30's gangster  Or something  That just kind of  Was dropped in a radio  You know  A funny story about Ronnie B  We was  He was working  The comedy corner one time  In West Palm Beach  When I was down there  And they used to play  Rocky Horror Picture Show  Next door  So me and Ronnie B  Would go in there  You know how they  Yell stuff at the street  Oh yeah  Well we started  This one guy  Looked like  From the Mary Tyler Moore show  The  What was his name  Lou 
[03:08:30]  Mary  Oh we love  Ted Knight  He looked like Ted Knight  So every time  Ted Knight would pop up  There me and Ronnie  Would go  Lou  Mary  And people  Nobody yelled it  But us  And so the next night  We went in there  And he popped up  About eight people  Went  Lou  Mary  Because they thought  You were supposed  To yell at  The guy  They didn't know  I'm probably doing it  To this day down there  Oh good  That smells like  New electronics  Where were we  Um  We were talking about  How no one knows  Bobby 
[03:09:00]  No that he actually  He knows Rich Voss  Oh the Rich Voss story  Right  Rich Voss just  He wasn't listening to the show  But he actually woke up  He heard that  Oh I'm sure  The radio wasn't on  Somebody's talking nice about me  We were outside the cellar  On Saturday  And Bobby's phone rang  It was Rich Voss  Like completely excited  Like  Apparently  An adrenaline rush  Was happening  Apparently  He's on stage  He's got  Three to four minutes left  In his act  So he was  Twenty minutes in  And uh 
[03:09:30]  Nothing  Uh  Oh  Oh  Hang on  And uh  He did it so  As a matter of fact  What are you doing  He knows Richie  Better than you  So what are you doing  I'm trying to tell jokes  Trying to be funny  Like he was  To get somewhere in life  You jackass  Let it go down  So he's on stage  And uh  Yeah  Some guy was yelling at him  And saying he's  He's saying he's stunk  He stank  And Voss was like  Well then get the  Go leave  And fucking leave  And the guy took a drink 
[03:10:00]  And threw it at Ross  Wow Voss  Whoa  Voss took a diet coke  Off of somebody else's table  And threw it at the guy  For a mature response  Well  I mean look  A guy throws something at you  You throw something back  Right  And uh  The guy went to rest the stage  And Voss kicked him in the head  Yeah  The guy went down  Another one of Voss's karate kicks  Was it one of those karate kicks  With his little legs  His little foot  It's kind of impressive  But he only stands about 5'4  So 
[03:10:30]  What damage is he really doing  And he has a size 6 shoe  Yeah  Right  Yes  And uh  It's like getting kicked by Dakota Fanning  It's like getting  It's like getting kicked by someone's keychain  So  So the guy got up  And came out up again  So he kicked him in the head again  I guess he kicked him in the head  What a dummy  Twice  Twice  And then the bouncers  Grabbed him  And dragged the guy out  But he only had a couple minutes left  That was the end  So they just said wrap it up  So he had  He had to kind of end on that note  Oh that's nice 
[03:11:00]  He couldn't sell his  He was like  It sucked  I'm like yeah that's crazy man  That's terrible  But that news  No I couldn't sell my DVDs after the show  Couldn't do my merch  Couldn't do my merch  He should have  UFC fucking shirts printed up for himself  We should get rich on the phone  Larry anyone attack you ever?  Who tells the best story?  Otto and George  Otto got stabbed once  Or the dummy got stabbed  The dummy George  The dummy got stabbed  His fucking puppet got stabbed  And then it mysteriously went through Otto's hand  Because I believe it's in the public 
[03:11:30]  Right right right  Now back in the 80s  A girl threw a drink on me  That's about it  Then I ended up banging her  Of course  I got it  I got it  I returned the favor  Gave her a little facial  I got into a fight with a guy  He actually threw a drink on me  And we got into a fight  And I wound up fucking him  So  It wasn't on stage  Just a little bedroom spat  I just fucked him  He said roasted fucking almonds  Jesus  I said roasted almonds  I don't want fucking regular almonds 
[03:12:00]  Wow  What's up man?  I'm just joking  I'm joking  I'm kidding  No he's not  I'm kidding  That was the real  That was the real Bob Kelly  Coming out for a second  Yeah why are you showing off  In front of Larry like that?  Yeah I'm showing off  That's what I'm doing  I'm throwing almonds  He's really impressed  He doesn't even know who I am  Sorry I don't want to be  He's madder than a hunchback  In a limbo contest  I don't want to be a hack radio guy  But there's a fact in front of me  I got to ask you about  You hit a 250 pound deer for real?  Oh yeah  Me and my publicist Maggie 
[03:12:30]  We were going to the  We were going to work a fair  In Pennsylvania  So we're headed to the airport  There in Lincoln  Live outside of Lincoln  And we're just driving down the road  And all of a sudden  Darting out of this bean field  Out of this corn field  Holy shit  Is about a 250 pound  12 point buck  No way  And I hammered him  But the funny thing was  I didn't  Because you can't slam on your brakes  Right  So I just slowed down  And hit him  Kept going straight 
[03:13:00]  The entire front end of the truck  Is smashed in all the windshield  And she goes  Weren't you going to stop?  And I go  My first words were  That was a big sumbitch  And I'm not kidding  We pull over  And I'm looking at the deer  And a van pulls over  And there's two dudes in it  That look just like me  And the guy gets out of his truck  And the first words out of his mouth  Were  Boy that's a big sumbitch  What are you going to do with it?  And I said  I got to go to the airport  And he goes  Well can I take it?  And I said  Go ahead  It's your deer  Oh it was great 
[03:13:30]  You know my brother  Hit a deer a while back  And it ain't funny  He could have been killed  But he's fine  So it's funnier than him  And I'll tell you what  He had  Hanging off the back of his truck  He had them fake bull nuts  Yeah  To make his truck look up  Well he hit a deer  Got  Rolled his truck  Got throat clear  And the paramedic showed up  Seen them nuts laying there  Thought they was his  And reattached them  At the hospital that night  And he's dating a nurse now  Which is nice  I know a friend of mine  That hit a deer 
[03:14:00]  In upstate New York  Him and his buddies  Was driving in a car  Hit the deer  The deer's ass swung  And like slapped into the door  And shit in the kid's face  Oh my gosh  Sometimes those things  Go right through the windshield  Yeah  They do  Well that thing came  Right on the windshield  Then rolled back down  We hit him  And then rolled over him  Like speed bumps  That's all you hear about  When people hit deer  Is how fucked up your car gets  From hitting a deer  Oh it was  It was messed up  Yeah  Turns out 
[03:14:30]  It was  Around Halloween  It was two kids  And a deer  Thank God  It wasn't a deer  Thank God  It wasn't a real deer  We had Peter Pratt  We got Rich Voss  Voss  What's going on  I was going to call you yesterday  I heard you got in a fight  A fight  Yeah  Richie how's it going  Tell your parents  I said hi  It was nice to come over  And eat with you again  I'm just kidding  Larry the cable  Rich  Larry the cable guy  In studio  How's it going  And he knows you  From last comic standing  And he doesn't know  Bob Kelly  Well he's like the rest 
[03:15:00]  Of the country  Oh  See Bobby  That was a nice  Stop telling everyone  My tricks  You ass  No more  No more promotion  For your twitter  What are we supposed to talk about  Why are you calling me  You had a fight  You had a fight  That doesn't happen every day  So we're like  Well let's get Rich on the phone  And see what he can tell us  About the fight  Well Bonnie was being a bitch  And oh not that fight  No I was on stage  And the front row  The two guys 
[03:15:30]  They were so plastered  One guy kept nodding out  Like the heroin nod  You know how you keep  He had a heroin nod  And the other guy  Was just like  He wouldn't  He didn't look up  The whole time  And I'm going to his wife  I go  Is he blind  Because I didn't know  If he was blind  And he just wasn't looking  Because it didn't matter  Because if he was blind  You know  And he was just so drunk  And you know  His head was down  So  You know  I'm doing whatever  Smashing whoever  And then I  Smashed these guys a little 
[03:16:00]  And then towards the end  Of the show  He goes  Well you stink  I go  Well that's okay  That's your opinion  I don't mind  But you know  If you don't  Why did you stay  For the whole show  You know  I don't like a movie  I get up and I leave  Well you know  It didn't get better  After 35 minutes  It's not going to get  Any better  So I go  Well you know  Whatever  So he gets up  And he throws his drink  At me  Which has happened  Many times  And uh  You know  When you were  On Last Comic 
[03:16:30]  My mom actually  Threw a drink  At the TV  So I threw my  Bottle of soda at him  And then he came  Rushing  To stage  I mean this guy  Was kind of big  You know  He was like  How Bobby used to look  You know  He was a big  Big husky guy  And he came running  At the stage  So I just  Kicked him in the head  You know  Because I was like  A little  You know  I'm a little higher  Up on the stage 
[03:17:00]  And then uh  Then he  He fell down a little  And he got up again  So I kicked him again  They started dragging him out  And you know  Of course  Just like  All the other times  Fights happen  I go  There goes my DVD sales  And they dragged him out  And they ended the show  So  And then the cops  There was cops  In a coma  And they arrested him  So anyway  Larry  Oh man  How could Rich  Kick someone in the head 
[03:17:30]  Twice  To get Rich  Got the head injury  Did he really need to tell us  He was on a stage  You kicked him in the head  We got it shorty  I was higher  Than him  Because I was on a stage  Usually you got a story  Like that  You know  It's going to be fun  What is he doing  Some of the ins and outs  Of what happened  I was  You tagged the DVD thing  I want to throw my drink  At the microphone  He sounded like  He was  He's probably tired 
[03:18:00]  He's probably tired  Well  Larry's been here  20 minutes  We haven't even told  The people why  The big Comedy Central roast man  We're roasting you Larry  Larry the cable guy  Being roasted this Sunday  March 15th  Is this Sunday ready  Holy shit  10pm on Comedy Central  Yeah that was  That was a treat  You know what  It was fun though  Because everybody on there  I asked for  They were all friends  Of mine  So it was a lot of fun  You know  And before they went up  On stage  I'd go  Don't let back  Don't hold back  Do it  So everybody  Comedy Central  Didn't just jam
