<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Opie, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton introducing their characteristically profane and boundary-pushing style.  Norton launched into a lengthy anecdote about his Monday morning search for his missing shoes, a humorous tale that segued into a recounting of a Saturday poker game.  This poker game involved guests Dr. Steve and Jenny Hutt (who briefly appeared on air), with the conversation veering into sexually suggestive comments about Hutt's husband. Norton detailed his poker losses, connecting them to his missing footwear.  He then transitioned to a heated discussion of the UFC fight between St. Pierre and Hendricks, expressing outrage at the judging decision, praising Dana White's criticism, and lamenting his own $25 loss.  The hosts debated the judging's impact on the UFC's reputation, with Norton mentioning his Twitter blocking spree stemming from disagreements about the fight and racial discussions.

A substantial portion of the show focused on Norton's appearance on *Celebrity Ghost Stories*. He detailed his genuinely unsettling experience in a previously Andrew Dice Clay-occupied Las Vegas hotel suite, describing hearing pool balls moving, murmuring voices, and seeing a disturbing reflection. He confessed to calling a prostitute to the room, a detail omitted from the televised segment.  The hosts discussed the episode, comparing the actors' portrayals to reality, with Norton highlighting the show's creative liberties.  Jokes and anecdotes followed, referencing a man named Edgar and the hotel's eventual demolition.

The show continued with a discussion sparked by Norton's ghost story, questioning the story’s truthfulness and leading to banter about the comedian’s storytelling techniques. This segued into a debate about political correctness and the use of offensive language, particularly the n-word and other racial and homophobic slurs.  The hosts and guests debated inconsistent reactions to offensive language based on the speaker's race and political affiliations, using Alec Baldwin, Riley Cooper, and the Richie Incognito/Jonathan Martin NFL scandal as examples.  They discussed the media's perceived selective outrage regarding racial slurs and violence, highlighting the disparity in coverage between incidents involving white perpetrators and those within Black communities.  A YG song featuring excessive use of the n-word was played to emphasize their point.  Matt Wilbon’s ESPN comments on the n-word and the subsequent debate were also analyzed.  The discussion was rife with offensive language.

The conversation shifted to a critique of female big-game hunter Melissa Bachman, using highly offensive language to express disapproval of her actions and photos with hunted animals.  Norton shared numerous crude and shocking anecdotes from his construction work experience, detailing pranks involving bodily fluids.  Further tangents included stories about Jim Florentine's long 90s hair and experiences at Woodstock '94, including an encounter with a man possessing an unusually large penis.  A caller, Adam, defended hunting, sparking a debate with Norton about the ethics of sport hunting versus subsistence hunting.  The hosts continued their scathing commentary on Bachman, interspersed with more anecdotes.  The conversation touched upon the legal and economic aspects of big-game hunting in Africa, discussing varying regulations and the motivations of hunters and governments.

The hosts continued their relentless mockery of Melissa Bachman, calling her names like "attention whore" and "vapid, shallow nothing," and mimicking her speech impediment.  A call with Joe Rogan followed, discussing the controversial UFC fight judging, Rogan's frustrations with the scoring and potential corruption, and a blood-spinning procedure he underwent in Germany.  Rogan speculated on the future of this technology, leading to darkly humorous discussions about creating "perfect" humans and bizarre physical alterations.  The conversation broadened to encompass life extension technologies based on Ray Kurzweil's predictions,  environmental concerns, specifically global warming, the health effects of pollution and different environments, and the challenges of high-altitude fighting and training. Norton rejoined the conversation, sharing his health concerns and experiences with alternative therapies like acupuncture, and comparing pharmaceutical and alternative medicines.

Jim Norton called in to promote his stand-up shows and Jack Osbourne’s *Dancing with the Stars* appearance.  Andrew Schulz and DJ Whoo Kid joined, discussing Schulz’s MTV shows, including *Guy Code* and a new dating show analyzing contestants' social media.  Vulgar, sexually explicit humor and commentary on social media followed.  The show concluded with a Steven Singer Jewelers commercial, using the ironic phrase "I hate Steven Singer" despite praising the jewelry quality.  Further discussion of Schulz’s success and future prospects and a mention of "Ron and Fezzer" as the next segment brought the broadcast to a close. The entire show was saturated with crude and sexually suggestive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Opie, the father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is it happening? This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment. 
[00:00:30]  And having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio is stuck hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people, real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  I just laugh into the microphone.  It's a good way to start.  To, um, you know, get everybody in that jovial mood, you know.  And check my mic.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  You ready for a Monday?  Who cares? It's Monday.  Let's all have fun anyway. 
[00:01:30]  Monday is just a pain in the ass.  I'm not breaking any new ground there.  But, uh...  I was walking around the, uh...  Walking around the house this morning  like a fucking idiot  looking for my shoes.  It's, it's...  And it's that morning, uh...  The morning time  where when you know you have to get out  at a certain time  you look at the clock  and it's like  that couldn't have been two minutes. 
[00:02:00]  It's it.  That couldn't have been two minutes.  It was ten seconds.  And I know I gotta get out  and get in  and drive in.  I don't wanna be late.  Cause then the second...  If I go over a certain amount of time  I'm driving  and Kenny calls me.  You know.  You okay?  So I, I look at the clock  and I'm like  ah, I'm gonna hit Kenny call time.  Yeah.  But, uh...  So I'm walking around the house  I'm like  where the...  My shoes.  And then you look at all the normal spots 
[00:02:30]  next to the bed  under the bed  downstairs by the couch  there's only so many places  I take my fucking shoes off.  In front of the liquor cabinet.  Yeah, maybe that...  Where did I pass out?  I was just like fucking...  I couldn't find them.  So I'm barefoot to them.  No, I had to throw on like  an old pair of sneakers though.  I still...  I can't...  I could not find my shoes!  Maybe somebody stole them  and you could do a funny voice  and accuse... 
[00:03:00]  My shoes!  What's that, Todd?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I couldn't find my shoes.  This is old shoeless  grobble-wobble  snappy-wapper.  Yeah, hey,  this is Tongue McGillicuddy.  Your shoes were no good.  They got up and walked out  on their own.  Did they?  That's always fun.  That are...  Those are problems  that pop up  when I guess living in a mansion.  You know what? 
[00:03:30]  That you lose your shoes.  Perhaps that is it.  You simply don't have time  in the morning  to look at every single room.  Yeah, I have three possible places  my shoes could be.  Yeah.  Right.  You never lost your shoes  in your apartment?  No, if I didn't walk over them  when I woke up,  they're in the living room.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, because I then...  I look at the grand staircase  and I'm like,  now I gotta walk  all the way up those stairs again  to check if maybe  I overlooked  where they were  in the bedroom.  and, you know,  I look 
[00:04:00]  and then, okay,  maybe they're in the bathroom.  So I looked in the bathroom  and they weren't there  and I have no idea  where my fucking shoes are  but thank God  I have another couple of pairs  laying around  and that problem was solved.  But, you know,  and I was getting mad.  You get mad.  You don't know where your shoes are.  I'm just alone  in my house  walking around  actually,  not just in my head,  but actually saying  where the fuck are my shoes? 
[00:04:30]  Like a mental patient  in my house.  Your life is empty  because your shoes are gone.  Because I have  my shoes are gone.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Do you ever hear that song  My Life is Empty  Without You, Babe?  Just put shoes  where you is.  Shoes, babe?  No.  Yeah.  Yeah, so, you know.  Well, I'll keep you all posted.  The mystery continues.  Yes, yes.  The mystery continues.  Do tell.  I'll keep you posted  as to where my fucking shoes are.  What are the emergency shoes  that you're wearing?  They're terrible. 
[00:05:00]  What are they?  They're just these fucking,  you know, whatever they are.  Oh, it's black sneakers.  It's black sneakers.  Oh, but of course,  I think they were captured here  once in a photograph  and I had to take fucking,  yeah,  days of grief  about my fucking shoes  because people,  yeah.  No, it's because  they're your shoes  and they have N on them.  That's true.  It is true.  And they're black.  They have, yeah,  they have black shoes  with the letter N  on them,  so I have a special name for them.  Yeah, yeah.  Fun-filled weekend, though. 
[00:05:30]  I would have made,  sounds like it.  Had, oh yeah.  If you lose your shoes.  Yeah.  If you can't find your shoes  by Monday morning,  you know it was pretty  bang-up weekend there.  A lot of fun.  Had the big poker game  on Saturday,  which Dr. Steve  was privy to this time.  He came over  with the rest of the fucking  poker vultures  that I never win  with these guys.  I think they're in collusion  against me.  Did Jenny Hutt go?  Jenny Hutt showed up  for what amounted to 
[00:06:00]  three or four minutes.  What?  She showed up  with her husband.  She comes downstairs,  says hi,  and then it's like,  well, okay,  I gotta go.  Well, they probably  thought it would be a party  where everybody was talking  and communicating  and having laughs.  No.  No, I don't know why.  But she just stopped in.  It was like,  it was very quick.  It's weird,  because she was like  begging to go.  I know.  Literally, on Twitter.  Please, please!  She never took off  her Bob Vila 
[00:06:30]  fucking down vest thing.  Really?  That she was wearing.  And, um,  yeah, yeah.  Maybe she had to get  out of there quick  because she stole your shoes.  I'm kind of,  I'm starting to think.  Maybe Jenny Hutt  took my shoes  for the abuse  that she takes  on this very program.  Her and her husband.  Her husband's like  some fucking  tall, good-looking guy.  Yeah.  I guess.  Is he handsome?  Yeah.  Good for Jenny.  Everybody looks stupid.  He's probably well-endowed.  Big cock, you think?  No, he's all cock.  She's a size queen. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Jenny's a size queen.  Yeah.  What a bummer.  Not only is he handsome,  he's got a massive dong.  Oh, yeah.  Big pull.  Oh, God, yeah.  I respect that.  Yeah, so she stopped him.  But Dr. Steve,  we got a few pictures  of him at the poker table  pulling out the old wallet,  pulling out some money.  I think he got fucking,  I think he got anally raped  pretty well.  Oh, no.  For the poker game, yeah.  You want to play Dr. Steve?  I want to get raped by you guys. 
[00:07:30]  We saved him to be Dr. Steve.  Jewish.  Yeah.  Yeah, so that was...  So you sent him back home  with nothing.  Yeah, it was pretty grim  for Dr. Steve.  Me, too.  I lost pretty big  that Friday night.  And then, I guess,  went upstairs to the couch,  fell asleep,  or passed out,  however you're doing.  Right.  And that was the last 
[00:08:00]  I saw of my shoes.  So you didn't have...  The last I saw of them.  And that was what night?  That was Saturday  night into Sunday morning.  So you weren't a big  social guy on Sunday, then?  Sunday, I spent the day  shoeless.  Yeah.  Around the house.  Watching TV.  Did you know your shoes  were missing,  or were you just having  that kind of a Sunday?  I did not even know  my shoes were missing  until this morning  when I went to put them on. 
[00:08:30]  It was quite a casual day.  It was a very casual Sunday.  Maybe Dr. Steve  took them as a souvenir.  Or Jenny Hutt.  Yeah.  One or the other.  I don't know.  I think Jenny Hutt  is the number one suspect  right now.  Yep.  She's begging to come over,  and then she leaves  after three minutes.  She was on Twitter  saying,  please, please,  let me come, let me...  And she shows up  for three minutes and leaves.  You don't think she took  some parting gifts with her?  Ulterior motive right there.  Yeah, that's right.  To take the shoes.  Yeah.  And then, of course,  during Saturday night's  poker festivities, 
[00:09:00]  on the TV  was the big UFC fight.  Yeah.  Which I was,  as they say,  beside myself.  Well, did you have  a little investment in that?  I had made a bet.  People are laughing  at the amount of the bet.  It was with Mikey Cuffs.  Mikey the cop.  Me and him made a bet.  $25.  That was your bet?  That was it.  Mr. Harding  from Cuckoo's Nest  made the same bet  with McMurphy.  I'll bet $25. 
[00:09:30]  It was an inexpensive bet,  but it was the principle  of the bet,  more so than the dollar value.  Yeah.  And I watched  the St. Pierre fight,  and the judging  was atrocious.  And I wound up  losing the bet.  And I was none  too happy about it.  How they fucking,  how the judges  weren't arrested 
[00:10:00]  for that  is beyond me.  They're terrible,  and this is why,  before the Sharks,  I think there was  a pro-Canadian  vibe in there,  because another fight...  Should that ever  make a difference?  No, but I just,  I had a feeling about it,  because there was another guy,  Rory McDonald,  who I love.  He's one of my favorite fighters.  But he lost the fight  to Robbie Lawler.  Fuck, he's a tall,  skinny Canadian guy,  and he lost.  And Lawler, I thought,  beat him pretty handily.  I think at least  two rounds to one.  And one of the judges, 
[00:10:30]  it was still a split decision.  And I'm like,  what judge thought  that fucking Rory McDonald  won that fight?  Yeah.  Believe me,  I wanted him to win the fight,  and he didn't win it.  Yeah, yeah.  What judge sits there  and goes like,  oh yeah,  he won that one handily.  And this is why  I love fucking Dana,  because he came out  and was...  Oh, was he angry.  He was disgusted.  And it is to his advantage,  like as a UFC,  the head of the UFC,  Yeah.  It's to your advantage  if George St. Pierre wins.  Yes.  Because hopefully, 
[00:11:00]  you can get a win  out of Anderson Silva  in December,  and then maybe book  a super fight,  like a Silva GSP fight.  It's not to his advantage,  if fucking Hendricks wins.  Right, right.  But he knows that  seeing a fight end like that,  It's terrible.  It's terrible for the fucking,  for UFC.  Yeah.  It puts UFC in that same realm  as stupid fucking boxing,  which just got destroyed  because of horrible judging  and management 
[00:11:30]  and everything else  that goes along with boxing.  Now,  the judge is just bad.  Like what motivation  would they have?  You never know, man.  Right.  Is it an odds thing  with Vegas?  Right.  You don't know.  You don't know.  The Nevada State Athletic Commission  has nothing to do with UFC  or boxing.  They're completely independent.  Yeah.  There's nothing Dana can do  to change them,  I don't think,  and neither could boxing.  He was angry.  We have a clip  because I love this.  I love the fact  that he jumps right on it.  That's why people,  that's one of the reasons  UFC is so popular  is because he fucking 
[00:12:00]  just comes out  and says what fans are thinking.  He doesn't tow the company on it.  And before he actually  made this statement,  because I got right on  fucking line on Twitter  and just started  fucking lambasting the judges  and what a fucking joke it was.  And then these motherfuckers  just start going,  oh, asshole,  he won that fight.  What did you watch?  What fight did you watch?  I watched it again last night.  I said, let me be fair.  I watched it again.  And then they're like,  oh, yeah, but did G,  first of all,  GSP being beat up  had nothing,  like his face didn't matter to me 
[00:12:30]  because he does,  like in the Condit fight,  he gets fucking,  he bruises.  Some people just don't like that.  You fucking rub their cheek  and all of a sudden  they're bleeding.  But he lost the fight.  People are like,  no, the 10.2,  I watched the fight.  He lost the fight.  He lost the fucking fight.  And then Dana comes out  and says he lost the fight.  Of course he did.  And I think Dana would know  pretty well  if somebody's winning  or losing a fight.  So go fuck yourself.  It's in Dana's best interest  to side with the judges.  Well, no,  they're not that bad.  You know what I mean?  He doesn't want people  to know necessarily 
[00:13:00]  that the judges are bad,  but he's being honest.  And he got the result,  which was a George St. Pierre win,  which again,  sets up a fight  with Anderson Silva  or whatever,  which is a tremendous  financial gain.  And he still came out  and he goes,  it's bullshit.  He wants the judging  to be fair  and to be right.  And that's why I think  people like him so much.  A super fight.  But at what cost, Jim?  At what cost?  Yeah.  Yes, yes.  Rogan said it.  In the ring,  Rogan said it.  You know,  it's like,  and these are guys  that love George St. Pierre.  Yeah.  These are not guys 
[00:13:30]  that have fucking  invested in him losing.  But he said to Hendrickson  in the ring,  it's like a lot of people,  myself included,  think you won this fight.  Because you look like  a fucking moron  if you're standing there.  If you're Joe Rogan,  you're in that ring  and you go along  with the horrible  decision of the judges,  you look like  you're some dumb crony.  That's not Rogan.  That's not his fucking personality.  You know?  Or Dana.  They say what's on their mind.  And Dana knows too  that the whole selling point 
[00:14:00]  of the UFC  is that it's real.  Like the integrity  of the product  depends on...  Unlike that fucking  horrible wrestling stuff  you watch.  And boxing  because people  stopped watching that  because they couldn't  depend on the result anymore.  Yes.  One of the reasons  boxing got stopped  being watched  is like you just  didn't get the fight  you wanted.  It took too long.  And I'm thinking that  while I was watching  this fight.  Yeah, it's true.  I was like I like  Hendricks a lot  or Johnny Hendrick  and his big left hand.  I'm like I want to see  him fight safe here  and I got the fight.  I want to see  the Anderson Silva  fucking Wybin rematch.  I got that fight.  It's coming.  It's like every fight 
[00:14:30]  you want they give you.  Fuck boxing.  Yeah.  Alright, let's hear  Dana's reaction  to this horrible...  Hendrick and I've been  saying Hendricks  before you start  killing me on Twitter.  Hendrick.  Yeah.  Alright.  This is a fight.  It's whoever  inflicts the most damage.  You get hurt,  you get wobbled,  you get dropped.  Yeah, I'm blown away  that George St. Pierre  won that fight.  And listen, I'm a promoter.  He's the biggest  pay-per-view star  on this fucking planet  for me.  And I still don't think  he won that fight.  I want what's fair  and that wasn't fair.  I think the Nevada 
[00:15:00]  State Athletic Commission  is atrocious.  I think the governor  needs to step in  immediately  before these guys  destroy this sport  like they did boxing.  Who is next?  We talk about  all the time  what alternatives  are there  and specifically  to Nevada.  The alternatives are  that the governor  needs to step in  and fix the incompetence  that is happening  in the state of Nevada  that used to be  the best commission  in the world.  It's absolute  100% incompetence 
[00:15:30]  and it needs to stop.  It needs to...  I'm fucking scared  to come back here  and do fights.  I'm afraid  of this state.  Jesus.  How fucking great  is that?  Yeah.  That's an honest  fucking statement  right there.  It's Hendrix.  I was saying it  with an S  and then I thought  I was wrong  and it's with an S.  I'm a dummy.  I'm a dummy.  How much do you love  that statement though?  Yeah.  It keeps your credibility  and the credibility  of your sport. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Because I was just livid.  I'm yelling at everyone  on Twitter.  Come on Dana.  Fix it.  Joe Rogan's a crony.  No, but Rogan said it  and Dana hates that shit.  It makes him look bad.  It does.  Once Dana said that  then was everybody  on Twitter  off your case?  Yeah.  They just go away.  Like, oh yeah,  I knew that.  Oh, was I on a blockfest  this week?  I probably blocked  over 100 people  this weekend.  Why?  I have various reasons.  There was the fight.  You know,  didn't like that.  So they disagree with you 
[00:16:30]  about the fight?  They're blocked?  No, it all depends  on how they do it.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's how they do it.  That and of course,  you know,  any racial discussion  will get some people blocked.  Others, not so much.  People don't seem  to understand.  They think it's just  if you disagree with me,  you get blocked.  It's not.  It's not true.  There are plenty of people  that I hold debates with  quite often  and it's fine  as long as we're,  you know,  a little give and take,  shit like that.  When it just comes down to,  you know,  you're an asshole  or you're a racist 
[00:17:00]  or you're something,  then, you know,  you're just fucking blocking.  Why am I going to bother?  I can't do those on Twitter  because I get too frustrated  in 140 characters.  You know what you ought to do?  You ought to write a blog  or something.  Like when you get like  one of these fucking things,  it's so frustrating  to not be able to say  what you want to say  in 140 characters.  Right, right.  Sometimes you want to  and then you're like,  you want to make everybody see?  I mean, me too.  I don't know,  but you don't care.  You just gotta,  but you said that.  It's just too much.  Yeah, it's,  you really have to finesse  those letters.  It's a no win.  It really is. 
[00:17:30]  You're not changing  anyone's mind anyway,  but I just like  the spirited discussion.  I get too angry.  I do, yeah.  I get pretty angry myself,  but, you know,  it's the only dumb outlet  we have in the public.  You know,  we have this,  which is great.  We got microphones.  You're one of the biggest  radio shows in the country.  But, you know,  who wants to talk  to the fucking callers  about that?  So, yeah.  It gives the other people  an opportunity  to chime in,  as they say.  Chime in. 
[00:18:00]  How did you see  the fucking Rashad Chael  fight?  Yeah, yeah.  Rashad is fucking,  I've taken one of those  punches.  They're not pleasant.  Awesome, yeah.  He was probably  hitting Chael harder  than he hit you as well.  In the face.  In the face.  Yeah.  Imagine that punch  in your face.  Yeah.  Ouch.  A lot of times  in a row.  Did you see  the fucking,  there was one point  when St. Pierre Hendricks  in the first round  when Hendricks  was driving his elbow  into the face.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not a punishment 
[00:18:30]  those guys take  from elbows, man.  Wow.  Is that awful?  It's amazing  they don't end sooner.  And the ref,  he was letting them fight.  There were a couple  instances where I'm like,  oh my God,  they're going to stop this.  Yeah.  And, you know,  the ref didn't stop it.  He stood them up  a lot more than  I thought he would.  Like a couple times  they were in the middle  of the ring  and they were actually  standing and he  broke them up to fight.  Sometimes if the guys  are just both  taking a break  in a jiu-jitsu move,  they'll stand them up.  I didn't think  they were doing that.  He was still,  yeah, yeah.  He was like  almost over-managing. 
[00:19:00]  He was like  Tony La Russa-ing  the whole thing.  But the best one  is fucking,  the best one is  Herb Dean,  the black guy.  I think he's the best  ref in UFC.  It was,  aside from the horrible  judging,  it was pretty good.  I kind of liked it.  Yeah.  That's some of that  conditioning  that I will never  be able to understand.  Not only do you have  to have your body  ready to fight  like every whatever,  four to six months,  but you have to  condition your body  to take a massive beating.  I don't know how  you do that. 
[00:19:30]  Every four to six months.  Yeah, how could you?  How do you even  condition your body  to fucking take a beating?  Just be hurt.  Did you see those  fucking,  with those kicks  when St. Pierre and Hendrix  were kind of like  grabbing each other,  Hendrix was doing  those fucking knees  to the thighs.  Yeah, he just pulled  his knee up and...  Oh, in the thigh  and his thighs  just jerking back.  You know how much  that hurts?  I'd be getting  a big charlie horse  right there  in the middle of the ring.  Like, ow.  Like, that's part of it.  Like, not only do you  have to protect your face  and be like,  okay, if I duck and weave here, 
[00:20:00]  every part of your body  is vulnerable.  You can get kneed  in the thigh.  Yeah, which would  really hurt.  Yeah.  I remember getting  that cramp in my leg  and screaming in pain  and my father told me,  you know,  next time I hear  you scream like that,  you better have an arrow  in your chest.  Right.  Right.  So that's got to hurt.  Too bad he didn't say  in your head  you might have been  Steve Martin.  You might have become  a very famous comedian.  I get it, Jim.  Okie dokie.  That's what happened.  As I said that, 
[00:20:30]  I was just like,  you better keep explaining  until the break.  So it was a very action-packed,  fun-filled weekend,  I think.  And it was capped off  shoeless last night.  Poor Anthony.  But with watching  just a wonderful television show.  Scary.  It was just great. 
[00:21:00]  Jim Norton.  Oh.  Featured on  Celebrity Ghost Stories  on the Lifetime  Movie Network.  Lifetime Movie Network?  Yeah.  It's a weird show.  It kept saying  Lifetime, Lifetime, Lifetime,  and it wasn't on Lifetime.  It was on Lifetime Movie Network.  That's why they show  all those movies  where like,  you know,  Marky Post gets a boyfriend  and he's wonderful.  Just the greatest guy  in the world.  But Marky Post's best friend  sees something wrong. 
[00:21:30]  Marky Post can't  fucking understand why.  She's like,  you're just jealous  of my new great boyfriend.  And they kind of  drift apart a little bit.  And then,  something happens  and this boyfriend,  you realize,  oh my god,  he's a fucking asshole.  Her friend was right?  Well, yeah.  And then,  it just,  it gradually grows into  him just punching her  about the face  around the house.  And then,  he's ready to kill her.  Ready to kill her.  And who comes 
[00:22:00]  swooping in  like Han Solo  I have no idea.  To fucking  clear the field  the best friend.  Oh, thank god.  I thought she was gone.  Nah,  she comes in  and saves her the day.  Oh, whoo.  Just proving once again  on Lifetime  that men are  pieces of fucking shit.  And that was proven  with Jim Norton's  ghost story.  Oh,  it certainly was.  Dude,  this was great.  I watched it.  You can get it.  I actually bought it  on iTunes  because the player 
[00:22:30]  wasn't working.  I think a few fans  might have gone there.  So I bought it  and watched it.  It was so fun  to watch.  I'm watching it  and I remember  what I said.  Yeah.  And then I'm watching  what they show.  That's the way it is.  They edit it and do it.  They actually do a good job  with putting together  a cohesive story.  Oh, yeah.  I was watching it.  I'm like,  this isn't scary  because it was mine.  No,  it was a good story.  Was it really?  I get watching  your own thing.  It was a good story.  It was creepy  and the only thing is  as I'm watching it, 
[00:23:00]  I'm like,  Jim would have conveyed  this story  to us at some point  on the air  and I didn't remember  really hearing this story.  Well,  part of it I've told  but the other part.  Well,  that's just it.  You kept to yourself  all these years?  Well,  perhaps you realize  that something  will work very well.  It was great.  I mean,  you were stoic.  You played it  very straight  as you told the story. 
[00:23:30]  I love the reenactments.  Oh, my God.  There was the Jimmy guy  and then Dice.  You're reenacting  this time  where you're in Vegas.  That actor who played Dice  looks just like him.  Rob Bartlett  looks more like him  when he does him  in the morning.  He does the Dice impression  in the morning.  And the guys who played  Kenny in Happy Face?  Oh, yeah.  And Jimmy's drinking.  I know.  Jimmy and Dice  down in some booze.  So,  how long ago  did you film it? 
[00:24:00]  I probably filmed that  five months ago.  Four months ago.  The whole time  are you thinking,  oh, God,  I hope they don't  figure this out?  Yeah.  See,  when I did it  I had to be careful  because there's  a lot of  let's just say  a lot of that  actually happened.  A good piece  of that did happen.  You stayed in the hotel.  And it was in Nevada.  But, no,  there was a couple  of other parts  that really did  completely creep me out.  But, you know,  you remember things 
[00:24:30]  like, oh, yeah,  that happened too.  That is creepy.  Did you really hear  the pool balls?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, but I heard it.  I'll tell you how I heard it.  Oh, please, yes.  Because this is all scary.  Should we watch  a little bit of it?  Oh, yeah, you want to?  Yeah, let's watch  a little of Celebrity.  I'm embarrassed watching it.  No, it's great, Jimmy.  You played it great.  Everybody's got a scary story.  Yes, yes.  All right.  I don't blink too much  in this.  I'm very proud of myself.  I was watching my eyes.  I'm like, ooh,  Blinky McBlinkfuck  finally got it under control.  Are you conscious of it now? 
[00:25:00]  I'm conscious of it  since 1974.  I've been conscious of it.  Where can they go to watch it?  They can go to  mylifetime.com  and...  Find it.  Yeah.  Or you can just Google  Celebrity Ghost Stories  and it's the first.  And Jim Norton.  It's also on our Facebook.  I know on Fios  it was on demand.  Hey!  I was able to just  click, click, click  and there I was.  Wait, mylifetime.com?  Yeah.  Thanks.  It's 2013.  I know.  It's amazing, the future.  Whatever. 
[00:25:30]  Here's Jimmy Norton.  Celebrity Ghost Stories.  This was not  the voices of people  that I was with.  I mean, at a point  I thought that I had  I had gone crazy.  There was something  wrong with me  that I'm hearing this.  Comedian and actor  Jim Norton  has been performing  for sold-out audiences  for over two decades.  Apparently they haven't  been showing up  to the gigs.  That's what it says.  While in Las Vegas  Jim jumped at the chance  to stay in a high roller suite. 
[00:26:00]  It was a decision  he would quickly regret.  This music is scary.  It is frightening.  I used to tour  with Andrew Dice Clay.  Liar.  I love the guy  that got to play Dice.  This is about  2009, 2000.  Pause it a second.  I could just see  pausing and pausing here.  Yeah.  The guy they got  to play Dice  looks nothing like Dice.  No.  He doesn't even have  a good bedazzled  Dice jacket.  No, he looks like  one of John Travolta's  friends in Greece.  Yes, yes.  Knicky or something.  And then the guy  that got to play you  he put on that face 
[00:26:30]  that is a Jim face.  He put on your  little smug face.  Who is that guy?  I don't know  but he doesn't look  like me from the front.  He looks like  there's a couple scenes  in the hotel  where they're not  showing the actual face  but from the side.  Really?  And I'm like  from that angle  he does look like me.  But you could have  just got me to do it.  Yeah, why did they just get  you to done it?  I'd have done it.  I'd have paid  my own airfare.  I wonder if they  get guys to do it  because they're probably  afraid the person 
[00:27:00]  will be too territorial  about things  and start trying to  and they probably  just get two actors  to do what we tell them  to do and knock it out  in an hour.  Right, because they're  going to edit up  your story.  There's got to be  a whole industry  of actors  that do recreations  because so many shows  do recreations.  My ex hated  dramatization actors  with a vengeance.  Really?  Loathe them.  And I'll read  the text you sent  after.  Oh, oh, okay.  Yeah, let's continue. 
[00:27:30]  I used to tour  with Andrew Dice Clay.  That was his opening act.  Back in music.  This is about  1999, 2000  and we worked in Vegas.  So Andrew got a contract  at the Stardust.  Doesn't look like him.  Which was one of those  really old school  original Vegas hotels  which for a long time  it was like the place  to be.  Isn't his great?  In that place  that I didn't feel  in any of the other  Vegas hotels. 
[00:28:00]  It just felt like  there was something heavy.  Is this true?  Something uncomfortable.  Is that true?  Yes.  I'll tell you one point.  The room that they  put us in.  I'm frightened.  We should turn the lights  off and you should  put a flashlight  by your chin  and tell us.  Good luck finding it.  Forever.  There was two buildings  at the Stardust Hotel.  There was the big hotel  that everyone sees  is the Stardust  and then there was  the nine floor  and they didn't portray 
[00:28:30]  I guess they have to  they have to edit  the ninth floor  of the high roller building  which was right next to it  which was a smaller building  and the ninth floor  was as high as it went  and the top floor  was like the presidential suite.  So Dice got the  presidential suite  and I'm the president  but I think that the hotel  kind of creeped him out  a little bit  and he bought a house  in Vegas  so I got to stay  in that suite  and Kenny  Kenny doesn't remember this  but he was there 
[00:29:00]  at that time  and him and Happy Face  I think were on the floor  and the ninth floor  was deserted.  It was just  I think it was myself  and then Happy had a room  Kenny had a room  and I had a room  and I had the  Dice had the big suite  so there was four of us  on that floor  my regular room  I wasn't using  because Dice gave me  his suite  so when Kenny  and Happy went out  with Andrew  I wasn't alone  on that floor.  Does that make any sense  because Dice  is in the city house.  Sounds creepy.  But it was actually  a creepy vibe  in that fucking place. 
[00:29:30]  They couldn't have just  used like photos  of Dice  instead of battery and access?  Maybe they're not allowed to.  They might need permission  to use those  if you didn't get permission  from the fucking photographer.  Fuck you!  That might be why.  Yeah, maybe.  They all have to do  with permission and legal shit.  Yeah.  They could have got my  I was not busy.  I would have bounced  in there to the music.  Oh, good Vegas music, guys.  You did it, dude.  It's that wacky  comedian music.  Look out.  Here he comes.  I was such an idiot  when I was a kid  when they would do  reenactments.  I'm still an idiot.  When they have reenactments.  I used to watch  Unsolved Mysteries  constantly. 
[00:30:00]  Unsolved Mysteries.  And they'd have reenactments.  And I remember  for a long time  just being like,  oh, this is what happened.  And then getting to  a certain age  where I go,  how the fuck  did they get this on film  if it's an unsolved mystery?  Yeah.  Not too long after that  I discovered  reenactments.  Kenny said,  worst actor portrayal ever.  Look at the person  who plays me.  I should sue for defamation.  How do you think he feels?  Wait till he sees  the real you.  Exactly. 
[00:30:30]  This is the guy?  And how are you  going to sue an ostrich?  That'd be great  if they just got an ostrich  put him there.  An ostrich with a tie on.  Yes, he's just pecking  at food at the bar.  Being mean to people.  Yes.  Well, let's continue  with Jim Norton's  celebrity ghost story.  Very scary.  The drinking.  Toasting.  What?  Andrew was there  with his two box marks.  Kenny and Happy Face.  And on this night, 
[00:31:00]  Andrew said to me,  the suite they give me  is not going to be used.  Do you want to stay in it?  Now, as the opening act,  you never get to stay  in a suite.  Ever.  So I was like,  yeah, of course I want this.  It was probably the first time  I'd ever stayed in a suite.  Sweet.  And I went up  to the suite.  It doesn't sound like him either.  No.  And that thing you know,  it's nice.  He has gloves.  Yeah.  Oh, the crooked hallway.  I got off on the ninth floor. 
[00:31:30]  They skewed the camera  to one side  to make the hallway tilted.  It was just me  and a hotel floor  full of empty rooms.  You're like Jack Tarnes.  And I got a slightly creepy feeling.  Oh.  They're flashing ghost faces.  Yeah, they're flashing evil people.  I felt like I was being watched  slightly creepy  as I walked down the hallway.  It's turned into him  like furrowing his brow  at every door he passes.  Were you doing that? 
[00:32:00]  No, but I did.  I'll tell you what I did do  on that floor.  I went back.  Instead of,  I left the high roller suite  for a while  and I got a prostitute  to come to my regular room  on the ninth floor.  I had a room down the hall.  So I went in there  just for the prostitute.  This way,  if they came back,  they wouldn't know  what room I was in.  Right.  I was thinking the same thing.  What's that?  Is that going to be  on the DVD extra?  I think I mentioned that,  but I think they left it out.  Of course they did.  They didn't want this  to be the ghost  of prostitutes past.  As I'm watching, 
[00:32:30]  I'm just like,  yeah,  they're leaving something out.  A prostitute, I'm sure.  They left a couple of things out.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  Ooh, nice digs.  So I got into the suite.  I mean,  it was the biggest hotel  I've ever been.  Tubular bells, exorcists.  I was thrilled.  Look at my smile, Malone, smiling.  There was a fireplace.  There was a bedroom  and there was a billiard room 
[00:33:00]  with a full pool table  and cues and sticks and all that.  So it was everything you'd want.  Even though it was an older hotel  and the suite had obviously  seen better days.  There had been many,  many, many years of people  coming in and out of this place.  And I knew nobody else  was going to be showing up  at the suite that night  so I latched the door.  The door had one of those  looks like,  shaped like that.  And it closes over the locks. 
[00:33:30]  We've just seen them, Jimmy.  Yeah.  I love your explanation.  We've all been to hotels.  And part of the thing  is me explaining  and then they show  the demonstration.  See?  He was not lying.  Looks like this.  Shaved like this.  And then everybody goes,  you couldn't have just said latch?  Yeah, but I was actually,  that was clipped there.  I was describing  what my escort had  hanging down.  It was shaped like this.  She was a lovely girl.  Like a giant hot dog.  Many, many, many years  of people  coming in and out 
[00:34:00]  of this place.  The doorknob was round.  It was shaped like this  that I pulled my cock out.  The door had one of those  looks like,  shaped like that.  Look at how awkward  my hands are.  Look at my fucking fingers  are splayed like a cadaver.  There were three hinges  on the door.  The door swung  when you opened it  as opposed to Star Trek.  That night.  I guess shut up.  There was a part of me  that was embarrassed  even alone to admit  that I was really  uncomfortable in this room 
[00:34:30]  and that I was  slightly frightened  to be by myself.  Wow.  So I found myself  just doing things.  Here's why I didn't go out  because I wasn't feeling well.  I had like a flu  or a real,  I was really feeling sick.  So I might have eaten  something down on the plane  or whatever,  but I was definitely  not feeling well.  That's why those guys  went out without me.  Oh, okay.  All right.  But you're still  called a prostitute.  Yeah, you're never  too sick for that.  I was ill,  but I wasn't ill-in.  Yeah.  And the billiard room  was above me. 
[00:35:00]  Not that that matters.  Oh, it was a two-floor suite?  Yes.  They're like,  just say it's one floor  because it'll be hard  to do that for the reenactment  to go to a two-floor suite.  Now, how did the door lock?  Yes.  Is there some kind  of mechanism on it?  Yeah.  There was a,  I mean,  I'm just putting out  my fucking,  my Blair's Cousin Jerry  from Facts of Life hands.  The palsy hands.  It was shaped like this.  And I walked  and you guys can't see  but I was doing  the finger walk  in the air.  Yes, of course.  Putts.  Fucking bent-handed putts. 
[00:35:30]  To be by myself.  So I found myself  just doing things  to avoid going to bed.  Getting across.  Jerking off.  I put the TV on  and I went into  the billiard room.  TV.  You turned the TV on.  I was going to play pool  but I just felt stupid  playing it by myself.  So I took the balls.  They were in the pockets. 
[00:36:00]  I took them out  of the pockets.  I racked it.  Rack is a triangular  shaped item.  It's like my hands  are making now.  I racked it  since girls' tips  are in screen.  I discovered it  for a game of eight ball  and then I left  the rack  on the table.  And I figured  we'll play tomorrow.  I was just  not even thinking coherently.  I was just doing something  to be doing something.  Ominous music, man.  Yes.  And they did get  the creepiness  in the room.  Oh, shit. 
[00:36:30]  Demon face.  They're flashing demon face.  And then I finally  went back to the bedroom.  That's where he looks  like me, see?  Oh, okay.  Alone in the bedroom.  Yeah.  Went to sleep.  Perfect.  Ha, ha.  Three or four hours later.  You're asleep.  I just slept with a light on.  Pretty scared.  I was awakened  by the sound  of a cue ball  hitting pool balls.  There's no other sound  like that in the world. 
[00:37:00]  And I heard murmuring.  Murmur, murmur, murmur.  So, I'd assume  that just Kenny  and happy face  had come to the suite.  And it made me feel better.  I felt like I wasn't alone.  I felt more comfortable.  Oh, boy.  Because Kenny was there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I knew the laughs  would be coming.  Spooning with Jimmy  in the bed.  Don't worry, Jim.  Yeah, giant seahorse.  Then I was kept awake 
[00:37:30]  by the sound  of the pool balls  and I'd start  to get irritated.  I irritated.  He goes from being  glad they're there  to, like, shut up.  Oh.  There's a lot of echo  and reverb on this show,  I noticed.  It's a loud pool game.  Echo and reverb.  Very scary.  You think I was asleep  on the table hearing it  that loud?  Yeah.  All right.  He's walking out.  I looked. 
[00:38:00]  There it is.  The door was still  latched from the inside.  Now, if I may explain  for 20 minutes  how this latch works.  Maybe I should do  an example of what  inside and outside  the differences are.  Yeah.  Maybe I could sprinkle  rain on myself.  This would be outside.  Fool.  Now, this is a great  little reveal for this.  You walk out,  you look,  and because I wasn't  even thinking,  it's like, okay,  he thinks Kenny  and Happy Face  and whatnot,  they're playing pool,  they came in,  and then when you go,  but the door's latched,  I'm like,  but the door's latched. 
[00:38:30]  That's why we spent  half an hour  finding out about the latch.  Yes.  It was a little foreshadowing.  I like it.  Yeah, you want to shadow  five and six still,  right, guys?  No.  Nope.  And, uh,  whatever.  So you walk past  the latch door.  Into the suite.  Mm-hmm.  And I was creeped out.  Did you just find a mirror?  Creeps out. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, gee.  All right.  All right.  I still could hear  the sound of the pool balls.  And as I walked towards  the billiard room,  I could hear  little odd  voices that I knew  were not Kenny, 
[00:39:30]  and I knew  it was not happy face.  Happy face?  Yeah.  Mike.  I wasn't imagining it,  and I know I'm not crazy.  that's the shining angle.  Yes.  Opening the door  to the billiard room.  Ah!  I walked into the room.  The pool balls  had been broken 
[00:40:00]  out of the rack.  Jesus.  They were all over the table.  It looked like  somebody had been playing pool.  Whoa.  I felt like I was  in a nightmare.  Holy Jesus.  Suddenly,  Jimmy,  I heard somebody saying,  I'm dry.  I'm dry.  My mouth  is dry.  My mouth is dry.  So I looked  towards the window,  and I saw 
[00:40:30]  a reflection  of a guy's face.  Oh, my God.  It was just an awful,  ugly face.  It looked like  he was being hurt,  but he was involved  in a struggle  with somebody else.  Of course.  It was a reflection  of something  that was happening  in the room,  but there was  nothing going on  in the room.  At that point,  I was as scared  as I've ever been  of anything  in my life.  Oh. 
[00:41:00]  Wow.  Wow.  The ghosts do,  I'm dry.  Dry.  Oh, my God.  Come back upstairs with me.  How scary is that?  My mouth is dry.  I think I said  teeth at one point,  too,  but, again,  I wanted to be,  I didn't want them  to go on and see.  Right.  And then go,  oh,  we can't see it.  So, yeah,  I was kind of being  a little...  Fucking Edgar. 
[00:41:30]  Big before  the commercial reveal.  Yeah, yeah.  I got a text  from my ex,  and she said,  when they had  the Edgar actor  saying his mouth  was dry,  I just felt humiliated  for him,  trying to find  a motivation  and channel a man  who was killed,  and it's just  a shitty Edgar Mellencamp.  Yes,  that poor actor.  What am I doing here?  I have to say  my mouth is dry. 
[00:42:00]  How long are my fingernails?  Yes, yes.  I guess I told her  I was going to do it,  and she said,  when he said  mouth is dry,  I'm like,  oh, God, no,  I swear,  before you walked  into the pool room,  I was praying  you backed out  of doing the Edgar thing.  It's just so embarrassing.  He's not dead.  He's alive,  an April Falsing person.  People on Twitter.  Are you Falsing?  That's the guy you played.  This is the fucking thing.  It's a joke.  By the way,  I've been awake for an hour.  I have 13% of my battery gone, 
[00:42:30]  and I've listened to three songs.  This fucking is enraging.  What happened?  Is that the new one?  It's the updated,  when you update the old phone  with the new operating system.  Uh-huh.  It's just horrendous,  Apple.  Yeah,  I had to shut a bunch  of systems off on mine  to even have it last  for a while.  Yeah.  Can I get the battery case?  Oh, God.  What systems?  Oh, that's good.  Like, uh,  fucking,  I just shut Siri off.  Yeah,  shut off Siri,  shut off location services.  Location on certain  fucking apps,  and, uh,  it's just a big pain 
[00:43:00]  in the goddamn ass.  Okay.  Should we finish watching?  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, yes, please.  Please.  Very frightening.  Y'all.  Well, what happened?  Oh, there we go.  The reflection.  Reflection of a window.  The guy's face.  That there was nothing  going on in the room.  And every instinct I had  said just go.  Yes.  Get out.  Yes.  Something is very,  very wrong.  I walked out of the room. 
[00:43:30]  I did not.  Oh.  Please.  Poor Edgar.  I was so frightened.  My mouth was crying.  I just quietly  walked out of the suite,  and I walked down  to the casino.  In your pajamas?  Yeah.  My PJs.  I found Kenny  and happy face.  What?  I told them a little  of what had happened.  I just told them  this is a creepy,  creepy place.  And they came back  upstairs with me.  and we walked 
[00:44:00]  into the room.  The vibe of the room  was different  than it was  when I had walked out.  That's what I say  when I'm bombing  and the comic before me  did well.  The vibe of the room  was a little different.  They don't seem to be  having what I call fun.  Yeah, exactly.  Those weird things  that they were doing  with their mouths  that showed teeth  have disappeared. 
[00:44:30]  All right,  so now you're up  in the room there  with the...  I just didn't feel  like whatever was there  was there.  I packed up my bags  and I went down  to the end of the hole  with those guys  and stayed  in the original room  I was assigned.  Oh, that's scary.  The next night  we were down  in the showroom.  I was talking 
[00:45:00]  to one of these.  Who's this  Captain Kangaroo guy?  The guy, by the way,  the guy playing the...  Oops, your mic  fell out of the stand.  Yeah, it's the ghost  telling me not to tell  the story.  Fucking ghosts are real.  You believe this one, Chip?  Fuck yeah.  Fucking Edgar.  You know Edgar, though.  Oh, it's him?  Yeah.  So this guy  that they got to play  is fucking hilarious.  He looks like  Greg the Hammer Valentine  on the Insane Clown Posse show.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's got like  long white hair. 
[00:45:30]  He's an old white guy,  but the guy was black  in real life.  That's why  when you hear him talk,  he sounds like a black guy,  but doesn't fit his face.  Oh, no,  but they got a  old white guy.  Old Ofe.  With a  Ofe.  With a snow white mullet.  Yeah, yeah.  I said,  I'm upstairs  in the top floor  at the end of the hallway.  I told him in the suite  and he said,  oh, they got you  in the Edgar suite.  And I'm like,  what do you mean?  Why do you call it that? 
[00:46:00]  And he said,  when the mob ran Vegas,  there had been  a murder  in that suite.  Somebody named Edgar.  trying to keep it  together there.  Yeah.  Edgar's tied to a chair.  He wants to drink water.  And now they choke him out. 
[00:46:30]  Poor Edgar.  When I heard that,  I was so creeped out.  And even though  I worked the Stardust  for another couple of years  with DICE,  I never went back  to that suite.  The Edgar suite. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Oh, they got you  in the Edgar suite.  The Stardust closed  in 2006  and was ultimately  demolished  by implosion.  Yes.  By implosion.  Let me explain  how this works.  My head should have  that happen.  Like the World Trade Center  that exists  that is beyond  anything I long  to acknowledge.  Yes, that thing is success.  And it changed  the way  I saw it.  Ah, 
[00:47:30]  that goes out  the window again.  See, the thing was,  I had said his name  was Edgar.  I said that I heard  the name Edgar  during the thing.  The guy was saying  something about Edgar.  So when the guy said  you're in the Edgar suite,  it was a callback  to the name  I had heard  in the room.  Yes, perfect.  But instead,  they used that  as the reveal  where everybody  can look at their TV  going, Edgar?  I liked the,  the bellhop's  explanation  was that,  you know,  there was a guy  named Edgar  and he was killed  and everybody  at the hotel  knew about it.  And they just  called it the Edgar suite. 
[00:48:00]  The Edgar suite.  And how did,  no story whatsoever.  How did the bellhop  know that the mob  was depriving him  of water?  Yeah,  his mouth was dry.  I don't know  to be honest.  Maybe.  The mob,  he didn't say that.  That was just  what the ghost,  I had seen the ghost say.  Well,  they had his character  in the reenactment  asking the mob  for what he said,  my mouth was dry  before they killed him.  I had seen that.  Yeah,  Jim and the window.  I saw that in the window.  Yeah.  I saw the gust.  I'm a gust. 
[00:48:30]  I bet the mobsters,  in their jovial way,  when they kill people,  later on,  probably told people,  remember Edgar?  Yeah.  We were ready  to fucking kill him  and all he was  about was like water.  He was fucking  saying his mouth  was dry.  Right,  he was just trying  to make April Falls  jokes the whole time.  Poor Edgar.  I actually felt bad  for poor Edgar there.  He was like crying.  Shit, Deb.  Well,  that's over.  I wanted a glass of water. 
[00:49:00]  It's very scary.  Shut up.  Edgar,  you should have just  cut through the ropes  with your fingernails.  Yeah,  use those awful fingernails  as knives.  Yes,  I should have.  What did you do,  Edgar,  that made the mob so mad?  I said,  in the casino,  I said,  hey,  look at,  let me see your cards  and I knocked them down.  Apple Falls. 
[00:49:30]  Oh,  April Falls.  Doesn't even give anyone  a chance to be falled.  No,  I'm just glad  that Edgar is dead.  I know.  The best is fucking,  the best is,  just my magic  can't get it right.  It's ruining his life.  I told you,  it's ruining his life.  Oh,  he can't get it right.  This is how he says it.  Okay.  We'll be in the restaurant  and the sushi restaurant  and the lady will come over  and go,  what would you like?  And he'll go,  I want cannonballs.  Apple Falls. 
[00:50:00]  That's not right.  It's so loud  and humiliating.  Buzz.  I'm just glad they showed it  and they pay you  to do reenactment.  This is why it sucks  because you go back  to these places  and you make more money  to do a reenactment  than you do  for the original thing  but they send guys  back to their original place  but the Stardust was destroyed.  Oh,  well,  yeah,  by implosion,  I hear.  Yeah,  by implosion.  Implosion.  Do I talk with that awful cadence 
[00:50:30]  all the time?  How does anybody listen to me?  It's terrible.  Fucking terrible.  I'm terrible at speaking for  Demolished.  I wonder if  in the wreckage  of the Stardust  in the pile of rubble  after the implosion.  Is it an unused condom?  Just a big pile  of those door latches.  They survived.  Yes,  they're shaped like this.  I like where you're telling the story  when you get to the reveal  that it's the Edgar Suite,  you roll your eyes 
[00:51:00]  and look away from the camera  and you can see  in that moment  you're about to crack.  You don't understand  how many times  I was about to crack.  I was sitting there  because you're in a room  and it's dark  and that light's on you.  It's like the old CIA  where you put just a light on you.  Interrogation,  yeah.  And you're talking  and you feel like such a dick  because occasionally  the director will jump in  and go,  could you say,  but he'll just look for a term  like,  and I was  instead of I'm going to,  like little things like that  because they know  how they're going to  piece the story together. 
[00:51:30]  They need different options  on your,  on things like that  this way,  however they show it works.  It makes sense.  And they know  what they're doing  and they actually  piece together  a coherent story.  How,  from when you got  asked to do the show,  how early on  did you know  you were going to do Edgar?  When my manager first said  they'd like you to do  Celebrity Ghost  before the tea was out.  That quick?  Yeah.  It was going to be  Chip or Edgar.  Uncle Paul made an appearance,  but I,  I just couldn't do too many  because even alone  I was going to laugh. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Now,  where,  where does this story  diverge  from fact  to Edgar?  Like,  what,  what,  what actually happened?  Faction to non-faction.  Faction?  I was,  I got really scared  when I went upstairs  and I heard,  I heard,  I woke up,  I was not feeling well.  Yeah.  And I thought  Kenny and Happy  had come back  and I heard,  I heard the sound  of a pool ball  dropping onto the table.  Okay,  that donk, 
[00:52:30]  like,  that unmistakable sound.  Yeah,  it's like a,  yeah,  yeah,  okay.  So I went upstairs  and I saw that the pool table  was,  the room was empty.  But,  but there was no pool ball  on the table?  No pool balls on the table?  He's like,  no,  no.  I was very scared.  No pool balls.  You were scared though.  I was,  yeah.  So you're probably  just mistaken about the sound.  It could have been anything.  No,  because I heard it more than once.  That was,  I was really,  I kept waking up,  feeling like I wasn't alone  and I was hearing things.  It was really creepy. 
[00:53:00]  That was one of the worst nights  I ever had.  Go back to sleep,  daddy.  Yeah,  of course that was that simple.  Balls on your face.  Yeah.  I heard the sound of balls  falling on my chin.  Yeah,  and I smelled onions.  I realized someone had brought  fucking Burger King  into the room  and I'm like,  oh no,  just a gentleman  with a crisis.  No,  I was actually  really frightened  in that room.  That was very fucking creepy.  Dice got creeped out  in that room too.  Like the hotel he didn't like.  You have to know.  Yeah,  the Edgar suite.  It's just that feel too  that like so much history 
[00:53:30]  and old school,  old school.  So things probably did happen.  Oh,  without a doubt.  It was like one of those  old mob rooms.  Yeah,  yeah.  It just didn't have a feeling  of being cared for  or being relevant  and I know that feeling well.  Even backstage,  that's where I got  my Don Rickles picture.  Me and Florentine  were doing that.  After a while,  we were doing that with Dice.  This is a while after.  And even the backstage area  was like Wayne Newton's  old dressing rooms  were back there  and it was creepy 
[00:54:00]  and old  and cryptic  and I don't know  what year was the Stratus built?  Oh man,  probably,  I'm going to say  50s.  50s.  53 is my guess.  19 and,  I have no idea.  1958.  Eight.  Yeah,  so that was way as in.  And it was demolished  by Implosion  in 2006.  Wow.  Implosion.  Damn.  Yeah,  that's like old school Vegas.  2007.  I wonder if  when you walk by the site now,  what's there instead? 
[00:54:30]  Yeah,  what is there?  Probably nothing frightening.  But do you think  Probably an empty comedy club.  Do you think that you can still,  if you listen closely  on a clear night,  hear,  My mouth  is dry.  You can,  yes,  because what's happening  is somebody's ordering a drink  and there's so few people  in the room  you can hear  each individual  and he's probably  whispering to the waitress  who's sitting next to him  wishing anybody else  was performing there  so she could make money.  I will be in Vegas  the 27th and 29th of December. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, yeah.  Returning to the scene  of this horrific  Wow.  Incident.  I'm doing the Hard Rock Cafe.  Thank God,  a newer hotel.  Yeah, yeah.  To celebrate  the New Year,  not New Year's Eve,  but around there  for UFC.  You guys,  there's still nothing  built on that site.  No?  That'd be weird.  They built a big casino  called Edgar's.  I just hope  if you're staying  at the Hard Rock  that they don't put you  in the Sheckler suite.  Oh, no.  The Chipperson. 
[00:55:30]  The Chipperson room.  A young boy named Lyle.  Yeah,  was lost.  Hard Rock,  how come they don't  call him Salt Pebble?  Boom.  A young comedian  named Lyle Chipperson.  I couldn't do  certain things  you can't do  because you know  you'll laugh.  Yeah.  The whole time  you're doing something  you don't want to laugh  because then you're afraid  that they'll go  alright and not air it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean  you have to keep  your absurdity  to a certain level.  I wonder who  would get mad. 
[00:56:00]  Who do you think  would get mad?  I don't think  anybody would  but I don't think  they want it to be  something that's been  very publicly  a radio show.  No, they don't want  their credibility.  They would probably  get upset if they  filmed everything  and paid everyone  and then found out  that it was just  a ruse.  A ruse.  A clever ruse.  Yeah, I wonder  how many people  do that though  just to be on the show.  I tell you.  All of them.  All of them, yeah.  I don't think  the other guy  from fucking  Bosom Buddies  had a real ghost story  either.  Oh yeah, that was him.  Celebrity ghost stories  to make a series.  Yeah, but you know what? 
[00:56:30]  Most people  even if they're lying  don't lie  and make it  an inside joke  so the whole  radio show audience  can then laugh  at the show.  Oh no, I wasn't lying.  I was telling the truth.  That actually happened.  You were?  Yeah.  That's where Edgar  comes from.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no.  I actually have  more than one ghost story.  You do?  I do.  A real one?  Yeah.  Another real one.  Save one for the next season.  I won't reveal it here.  It's too frightening.  Well, I'd like to hear it.  Can't we just have a taste?  No. 
[00:57:00]  But again,  that's  a young  young man  telling bad jokes.  Whatevs.  Whatevs.  Whatevs.  That's  that's ludicrous.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah.  I don't give a fudge.  Yeah.  Chip's probably  afraid of ghosts anyway.  Yeah.  Pussy.  He is a pussy.  Punch a ghost  right in the face.  Will ya?  Fuck yeah.  Haunt this.  Yeah. 
[00:57:30]  Then grab your nuts.  Very scary.  Haunt my pecker.  Nice.  Haunted pecker.  Alright, that's cool.  Yeah.  Well, that was great.  I was very surprised  at the reveal.  I didn't know you  kept it hidden very well.  Yeah, I kept it  a big secret  for the guys.  I wish they had just  like  they used all actors  for the reenactment  except Club Soda Kenny.  Like how great  would it have been  if Kenny  is there in the reenactment.  Yeah, but he probably  just didn't see  the ad they put  for a monster. 
[00:58:00]  Seeking monster  with organization skills.  They did get  a big tall guy.  Oh, did they?  Yeah.  He was like  he looked like Kenny.  Tall guy.  He'd come to the room.  Ugh.  Shut up.  You were  definitely playing it.  Nice.  Talking straight.  Very guess.  Slow.  Calculated.  Methodically.  Picture of Edgar.  Who played Edgar?  I don't know.  Put him on IMDB  and see who fucking  see what else he's done. 
[00:58:30]  Probably DB Cooper.  Characters.  It's too bad  they didn't know  his last name.  It would have been  so great to see  Edgar Mellencamp  show up on IMDB.  Then you Google that.  That's true.  You can't have that.  Well, that is true.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, let's find out  if this is a true story  and it's just you.  You think they Google  the stories?  This guy's on...  Well, yeah,  they probably want to find  if there's a name  attached to it.  You know.  I'm...  I'm being...  I don't have the money  I owe you.  The money. 
[00:59:00]  Some old man  with a mullet  said,  Oh, you into Edgar's suite.  Yeah.  The 19-year-old black guy  who...  Yeah, yeah.  You into Edgar's suite,  motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  Alec Baldwin.  That's a whole story.  I guess we could...  It's awesome.  ...get into that  after we take a little break.  It's kind of fun.  I love the fact that  they just keep poking...  Look at the way  these fucking vultures  roll over this guy.  He's just an actor.  Yeah, yeah.  Why...  In front of his car.  I don't...  The thing is,  he's giving them 
[00:59:30]  what they want every time.  He gives them gold.  Oh, yes.  But it's probably hard  not to.  These scum...  Because they really  are scumbags.  Chasing down the street  and...  Probably...  What's that?  Donald Trump on the phone?  He's a different  kind of a guy.  He gets very angry.  I have people  taking my picture.  Let him take my picture.  Do you think he's serious?  The photographer  takes my picture.  I don't punch him  in the face.  Do you think he's serious  that he was quitting?  Oh, Donald.  Oh, that Donald.  I don't think he'll quit.  No, he's been saying  that before.  I mean, he's said it before.  He does get very angry.  Look at the way  they're putting the mic  in the face like...  I know. 
[01:00:00]  It's very fucking  intrusive.  How do you...  They just stand...  She ought to be able  to knock that microphone  out of her hand.  This is a guy  who's now made...  Allegedly made  some gay slurs.  He's...  Who cares?  Who cares if he said  faggot when he's mad?  I know.  God almighty.  You're allowed to do that.  Gay slurs.  Fox News is loving this  because he's on MSNBC.  Yeah.  Well, you know  who else is on MSNBC?  Reverend Al,  who said those Greek homos.  But, you know, 
[01:00:30]  apparently if enough time  goes by and you're black,  it's fine.  All right.  I guess we'll take  a little break.  As they call...  I like calling it  a break-a-roonie.  Take a break-a-roonie.  Hey there, break-a-roonie.  And we'll come back.  Yeah, I'd like to talk  about the Alec Baldwin thing  and the political correctness  gone mad in this country.  Oh, haywire.  After all this is worse.  The O.P.N. Anthony Show  will return 
[01:01:00]  after these messages.  The O.P.N. Anthony Show  continues.  Oh.  Any reason?  Any reason for this music?  Nope, just a bit.  All right.  I like that.  I was just fucking  rocking over a song  all weekend, too.  Abba?  Huh?  Abba? 
[01:01:30]  No, it wasn't Abba.  Oh, thank God.  It wasn't Abba  or Abba.  However you want to  fucking pronounce it.  How you doing,  Mr. Florentine?  I'm curious to what song  it was.  Oh, it's fucking great.  Maybe we could  punch it up.  Were you tweeting it out  a couple times?  I tweeted it.  I tweeted it.  I think I should  announce the artist.  Yeah, yeah.  Is it by an artist  named YG?  It's YG.  Oh, yeah.  Featuring some  of his closest friends.  Is it?  It's pretty goddamn good. 
[01:02:00]  It's very catchy.  We played it here before.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  It's very catchy.  I was rocking it  all weekend.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  See, it's a big hit.  Oh, yeah.  They love it in the club.  Yeah.  I'm not singing  on a ride  for my motherfucking new  Most likely I'ma die  with my finger  on the trigger  I've been grinding  outside all day  with my niggas  and ain't going in  this one with  my nigga  my nigga  my nigga  my nigga  my nigga  my nigga 
[01:02:30]  my nigga  I was just all  fucking weekend.  I'm just going around  singing this.  This isn't usually  your type of music.  Oh, but this is great.  And there's all story  to the video  fucking guy  gets arrested, right?  Uh-huh.  But he don't rat  because, you know,  his niggas  don't snitch on him.  Oh, I see.  And he goes  through the system  and everything  but then he gets out  and he gets rewarded 
[01:03:00]  for not snitching.  It's a great message  that they're sending out.  Well, I've heard  snitches get stitches.  Well, that's true.  Yeah, that's my nigga.  Oh.  I like that part  where he goes,  my motherfucking nigga.  Well, now he's in jail.  Yeah, because he didn't rat.  They probably play this  on Hits 1.  This one hasn't made it  to Hits 1 yet.  No, not yet.  And now for all  the motherfucking niggas, 
[01:03:30]  I'm Casey Kasem,  the American Top 40 Countdown.  He's in his hip-hop outfit  in prison.  I don't think they'd  let him wear it at.  I don't think so either.  But, uh...  How many times  do they drop  n-bombs,  as they call them,  in this song?  In this song.  It's got to be  well over 100.  It is.  200.  I think it's  160-something.  160-something.  See, look,  they got a bunch of evidence  against the motherfucker.  But he didn't rat 
[01:04:00]  on his boy.  Who is this?  That sounds like Jeezy.  Of course they are.  I mean,  if you wanted to find it  on an album,  you'd have to  pick up YG's album.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What's up?  You gotta give him this.  Yeah.  He does rhyme.  Yeah.  I'm enjoying this.  Figure,  trigger,  nigga.  I'm not offended, 
[01:04:30]  but this is good.  No.  Nice tempo.  YG,  my niggas.  Right.  Shout out the artist.  It's just hilarious  how many times  they fucking say it.  They're outside  on a warm day  enjoying some adult beverages  with their friends.  Of course.  Some nice fucking  old Chevy Impala.  All fucking hooked up.  Does this not show you  how fucking fake  the outrage in this country  is over that word?  Yes.  The entire point. 
[01:05:00]  Yes.  So silly.  There is  this fake outrage  that obviously,  you know,  this would be  a prison sentence.  if the outrage  that gets people  fired  and makes  people grovel  and apologize  for using such  horrid language,  if that was honest,  these guys  would be in  purgatory.  Right.  CNN would be doing  a round table  on this video  right now. 
[01:05:30]  They're not going to  touch it.  Exactly.  That's just it.  It's phony,  fake outrage.  So just keep fucking  mocking it  and attacking it.  Yeah.  I don't care.  Offensive.  I think this  rules.  It really does just  make the word  nothing.  Yeah.  Like it's used  so many times  it's just like  but yeah,  I was just fucking  bopping around the house  all weekend.  Wait,  and that's on YouTube,  right?  Oh yeah,  it's got 23 million views.  It's funny how certain  things are removed 
[01:06:00]  because they're considered  hate speech  or they're considered  bullying  or they're considered  whatever  but YouTube knows  what not to fuck with  so they're cowards too.  Don't play this song  on Hip Hop Nation.  This is a big,  big song.  They actually should.  I was walking around  going like  motherfucking Beavis  my cat,  my nigga.  I was just singing  it to Beavis.  My brother was my nigga.  Right.  Dr. Steve playing  poker's my nigga.  Right.  It was all weekend.  Well that's why  you love this song  because it's like  it takes all power 
[01:06:30]  from that word.  You can now use it  amongst your friends  in a fun way.  In a song  instead of screaming it  in my vehicle.  Right.  Like I normally do.  Yeah,  why don't you just play this  on the LIE  when there's traffic?  Yes,  yes.  Yeah,  so that was catchy  all weekend.  Well they're going  after Richie Incognito  because  Jonathan Martin's mom  took that off his cell phone.  She's a lawyer.  She went to Harvard.  She went through his phone  and found that one text. 
[01:07:00]  That's the one?  Yeah,  that's where it came from.  His mother?  Ew!  He went back to his mother's house  after he got  so-called bullied.  And she's like  both his parents  went to Harvard  so he's not accepted  in that locker room.  Uh-huh.  He's a rich, spoiled kid.  He could have went to Harvard.  He went to Stanford  to play football.  And then he comes  in the locker room  and they're either thugs  or meatheads.  Yeah.  So he walks in.  He's the rich, spoiled kid  so they pick on him.  And he was a second round pick  which is supposed to be good  at tackling.  He's been a bust so far. 
[01:07:30]  Uh-huh.  So they're all over his ass.  They're making fun of him.  And then, you know,  he goes home to mom  and then mom takes  this little text off.  This little,  not in context at all.  The black players  have no problem  with Richie,  the head linesman.  Uh-huh.  He's like the head guy  in the locker room  saying that word.  If they did,  they would tell him,  dude, don't say it.  Right.  And this is where we're at now  because of that.  Do his parents not really,  like, do his parents think  that that's going to help his case?  That now his mother  goes to his little cell phone?  His little mama's boy?  Right.  Yeah, that's what she did  because he didn't really want to, 
[01:08:00]  he just said,  look, I got to get out of here.  This is getting to me.  He didn't really want it  to blow up to what it was.  I'm sure.  It makes him look like a fucking man.  Right.  He just said,  I'm going to go away  for a few days.  And that, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  And now there's like  some internal investigation.  He was, you know,  being interrogated.  Yeah.  Well, the offensive line coach  in the Dolphins  is a former Marine.  So, you know,  he was all over that guy's ass.  He's the one they're going after  now at the NFL  because he was the one  that was riding them.  Of course.  Toughing them up.  Yeah.  The guy was an animal.  I've seen him on like 
[01:08:30]  that hard knock show  from last year.  The guy's a psychopath.  So, you know,  he's fucking in his ear  constantly.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  It's such a ridiculous thing  to, I mean,  you hear about  the locker room culture  and NFL,  the players,  you know,  they beat the shit  out of each other  verbally, too.  And it's racist,  fucking sexist,  sexist, homophobic,  whatever you want to call it.  And they're doing this  in the locker rooms.  It's just accepted  between them  and that's all it should be. 
[01:09:00]  If they recorded  a conversation  with Jim and Voss  and Keith Robinson  and all those guys  at the comedy cellar  one guy explaining  to two guys  what a sellout bonus is.  But just,  you know,  that ripping  that goes on,  you know,  all of that stuff,  the racial stuff  or whatever,  amongst friends.  Exactly.  If someone had  a tape at Angle,  this is what Jim said  to, you know,  when Patrice was still alive  or Keith  about being black  and Artie Fuqua,  all of that stuff.  If you don't want  to be in that mix,  then get out of it. 
[01:09:30]  A lot of comics  don't even want  to go near there  because they know  they're going to get destroyed.  But in that,  just ripping each other  and making fun  of each other,  it's not a problem  in that world.  You put a soccer mom  in there,  hearing those conversations,  this is terrible.  How could they do this?  We have to stop this.  How can a grown man  who's an NFL player  not be able to tell  his mom  to knock it off?  How fucking  embarrassing is that?  That's humiliating  because it didn't seem  like Jonathan Martin  was the one who  was trying to make this  the big public thing  that it is.  Incognito had texts  from him that said,  dude,  this isn't me. 
[01:10:00]  I don't know what's happening.  It's not,  it's not going to do  with you.  It's the locker room cult.  How does your fucking mom  have you a fucking password?  Something tells me  he might have given it to her  and then regretted it  like, oh fuck.  But you can't now say,  mom, stop.  Yeah, yeah.  It's out of his hands now.  And this is why,  and I know most people  disagree with me  on my stance  on the Redskins  changing their name.  I know that.  This is why.  Look at how,  I know this is not the NFL,  but this is the mentality  of sports,  of baseball,  of football,  if it's a black thing  or if it's anti-gay. 
[01:10:30]  You say faggot  in the locker room  or you say nigger.  Who was the guy  who said nigger  at the Kenny Chesney concert?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The fucking whole system  shuts down.  Yeah, Riley Cooper  from the Eagles.  Go to the sensitivity train.  Sensitivity train.  These PC cocksuckers  in the NFL,  but in this one place  they feel comfortable.  It's like,  you either gonna  show balls everywhere  or don't,  you know what I mean?  That's what bothers me.  They're such fucking cowards.  I was always against  changing a Redskins name,  but then I heard  Jim's theory on it  and I like it.  I like that.  It's the first time 
[01:11:00]  I agree with it.  My good,  go after it.  Because the whole thing  with this whole thing  with Incognito  and the bullying,  it's all because  they opened up  the game to everybody.  As soon as they wanted  the females  and the nerds  playing fantasy football  in on this  to make it everybody,  I want everybody to watch  with the Super Bowl,  with the Beyonces  and the full Bruno  fucking Sammartino,  whoever's playing this year.  this shit  that nobody cares about  and that's why  you're having  roundtable discussions  on CNN about this  because everybody  knows about the game.  When you're getting  women involved, 
[01:11:30]  that's terrible.  Yeah,  family entertainment.  Hockey hasn't done that.  Hockey doesn't have  fucking pink pucks.  They didn't try to sell out  to get the women,  you know,  Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  They got a guy  that goes on the ice  just to fucking fight people.  Guy pulled his tooth out  on the ice the other night,  just ripped it out.  They had a,  you know,  if that happened in the NFL,  all the moms were like,  that's terrible.  What kind of example  is that setting?  And this thing keeps going  because,  think of this,  the nerds are the ones  who got picked on  by the Richie Incognitos  in high school.  The meatheads. 
[01:12:00]  So now they're the journalists.  They're the ones  that keep fucking  fanning the flame on this  because they reminded  that guy that fucking  threw him in the locker  in high school.  Now they could get their  vengeance.  So that's why  they keep going and going  because, yeah,  get rid of that guy.  He's watching me.  They could do it  without a penalty.  Like,  you can't bully somebody  without having a penalty.  But if a bully,  if it's a bully,  you could do  whatever you want to him.  He could ruin his life  without anybody saying  that you're a bad person  for doing it.  But where's the NFL  saying,  hey,  where's their fucking statement?  Where's their coming  to the defense of it?  They won't do it 
[01:12:30]  because that word  is involved  because it's white  and black race  or it's a special interest  group that they're scared of.  They fucking,  they fucking back off  and, hey,  we're going to do  the right thing.  They have brought  this on themselves.  Baseball too,  all of them.  They grab their ankles  and they take special interest  dick as far in  as it will go  and they deserve  what they get.  They deserve to be sanitized  and fucking whitewashed  and clean  and now all the shit  that's happening to them  they fucking ask for.  Good,  fuck them.  Makes me sick.  I'm just astounded 
[01:13:00]  by the hypocrisy  of the whole thing.  It really is infuriating  sometimes.  I don't think  there's any outrage.  There's no true outrage  over words.  Sorry.  Even the Redskin name  right now  just at this  bullying things  in the news  nobody's even  talking about the Redskin.  No one's even brought it up  the last three weeks.  No one brings it up.  There's no,  yeah.  They did a,  the poll is 10 years old  but 10 years ago  they did a poll  with Native Americans  and 90% said  it's not offensive  to name Redskin.  They haven't done one recently  but still 10 years ago 
[01:13:30]  they weren't offended.  Nothing has changed.  It's either offensive  or it's not.  Except it's been  all over the news now.  So now they'll have to say  oh yeah,  I'm offended.  If they did it with,  I've said it before  but the only thing  that it's like  if you're going to be  so sensitive  to everybody's feelings  then American Indians  have been kind of  treated like dog shit.  You got to at least  give them the same respect  as everybody else.  But if the NFL said  look,  it's a team name  we kind of  we caricature things here  it's part of the sport  we do it with blacks  we do it with Jews  we do it with the Italians  I'd be fine with it.  I would root the fucking 
[01:14:00]  if the Kikes were playing  the Spicks  I'd be there  on the 50 yard line.  I really would be.  I would support the fact  that they were showing balls  equally.  They just won't do it.  They're fucking  the worst  they won't do it.  No, they won't.  And then  we were talking about  the Alec Baldwin thing  that happened  where he's being  harassed  by paparazzi  and media  and he yells out  a cock sucking faggot 
[01:14:30]  at somebody.  Was it a woman  that he yelled out at?  I don't think it was.  I'm not sure  who it was  or what have you  but I don't think  he meant it  in a sexual way.  Or a literal way.  No, of course he didn't.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like  that's what you say  it's a fucking  it's a way to  yell at somebody  if you're pissed.  Just being angry.  Just to call somebody  a piece of shit.  You literally don't think  the person  is a log of fecal matter.  Right.  He's a piece of shit.  Yeah.  Yes.  Well, he's saying  he said fathead  instead of... 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He's trying to cover it up.  He said I said fathead.  A cock-sucking fathead?  Yeah.  Because that really  those words go together.  Cock-sucking fathead  instead of cock-sucking faggot.  Wait, is it on tape or no?  Yeah, there's video of it.  Can we hear it?  Yeah.  Do we have it?  Yeah, we got it on...  It's on the computer device.  This is like the fourth time  he's...  Said faggot, yeah.  Yeah.  And Glad is just like  we're disappointed in him  but nothing else.  He's still doing  Capital One commercials.  Right.  He's still doing all this. 
[01:15:30]  He'll be on Letterman  two nights from now  getting a standing O.  You know what I mean?  Look, why?  Why does he get a free pass  all the time?  Because of his political ideology  and his little pals  at MSNBC and whatnot.  If it was somebody  like Sean Hannity  who was saying that  or Nugent...  Right, right.  Well, look at Mel Gibson.  I mean, the guy  cracked a couple of Jew jokes  and he's done one film  like three minutes  in one film  in the last ten years.  Yeah.  Fathead.  And he did it  and he did it  by the way  in his own... 
[01:16:00]  Mel Gibson did it  on a private conversation  to an angry one  to his wife.  It's just the fucking  double standard  is so frustrating.  So you just got to  respect none of it.  Respect none of it.  It's all one.  I kind of like Alec Baldwin  and the way he deals  with these people.  I hate his politics  but I do like the way  he deals with these fuckers.  He genuinely scares them.  They're backpedaling away  with the camera on  but they know  Alec will punch you 
[01:16:30]  in the face  so you probably  ought to steer clear  of him  but boy,  he gives them  exactly what they want.  A show.  A fucking show.  Yeah, we got to  talk about that too later.  I got no problem  with Alec Baldwin.  Actually, I like him  and I think that he's  handling this the way  I would want to handle it.  Why should he be nice to them?  They're fucking...  They're vultures.  They're hassling him  and why can't you?  When somebody gets in your face,  you cock-sucking faggot  is a legitimate response  instead of punching them  in the mouth.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, right  because now they're  taking the words away 
[01:17:00]  besides your fists  which used to handle it  and now they're  taking the words away.  The guy's coming out  where he's got  a four-month-old baby.  He's trying to put  the kid in the car  and I bend through that.  You don't want  a camera in your face  annoying the shit out of you.  They're pieces of shit  and they keep antagonizing him  and poking him  like he's a hornet's nest  and he's giving them  what they want  but they're making it happen  and then they fucking  respond shocked  when he...  It's fucking...  Yeah, the shock  and outrage on their part.  Oh, how could he do that? 
[01:17:30]  But they poke at him.  You're right.  They try to get that response.  The second they get it,  he's the asshole.  They're camped  outside his building.  Yeah.  It's crazy  and now it's worse than ever.  Yeah.  Because...  Looks like Rob Ford's office.  It's the story.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the story now.  But, all right.  The saying,  cock-sucking faggot  in the context he said it.  Again, it's just...  You're pissed.  He was angry  and he said,  cock-sucking faggot  and that's perfectly legitimate.  He wasn't saying it  to a gay guy 
[01:18:00]  in the context  of being a homosexual.  Everybody knows that!  Yeah.  But we've...  We're at such a strange place  right now.  At some point,  I think they're going  to be taking away  the word cock-sucker, too.  Because if I call you  a cock-sucker,  that means...  He'll turn around  and answer.  You're being honest.  But that means,  like, you're gay.  I think that you stick  a dick in your mouth  and you're gay  and I'm calling you  a derogatory term.  So that word eventually  is going to go away, too.  They haven't gone after  that one for some reason.  I don't understand  why any of these words 
[01:18:30]  that are supposed  to be so evil  are always equated  to assault  and degradation.  It's ridiculous.  Because some of these words  have a dual meaning.  Calling someone  a cock-sucker,  one,  they're sucking a cock.  That's one use  of the word.  Why can't a woman  be a cock-sucker?  Well, they are.  Believe me.  Oh, I know it.  Fucking cock-sucker.  And then the other one  is you're pissed.  Get the fuck out of you,  fucking cock-sucker.  It's a term of anger  and, yeah, 
[01:19:00]  it doesn't necessarily mean  that you think  they're sucking cock.  And it's not a degrading term  to gay people  if you're using it  in that context  to a straight person.  It's just ridiculous.  It's the same thing  as the word redskins.  We only use that  as a reference  to the Washington Redskins.  We don't use that name  any other time.  Yeah, there you go.  You know,  it's just like,  you know,  when you reference  the Negro League  that Satchel Page  used to play in,  you don't say Negro anymore.  They don't like that.  Okay, fine.  But when you have  to reference that league, 
[01:19:30]  you go,  hey,  he used to play  in the Negro League  because it's acceptable  to use it at that time.  It's the same thing  as the redskins.  You only,  if I got in a car accident  and some guy  hit me in the back  or a fucking Indian  hit me in the back,  you know,  Jim's going to go,  really?  Is he from Pakistan?  I go,  no,  he's one of those  fucking guys  that own the casinos.  One of them.  Oh, that guy.  I'm not going to go  fucking redskin.  Oh, redskin.  Wasn't paying attention.  No one uses  the word redskin  as a derogatory term  toward Indians anymore  since, you know,  the 1900s.  However,  when you look  at the Cleveland Indians, 
[01:20:00]  in fairness,  can you say  that that fucking  smiling Chief Wahoo,  you like Chief Wahoo?  It's fucking Sambo  who's red.  You like Chief Wahoo?  With the big  Dunlard of Mercy teeth.  Look at him.  Can you imagine  any other fucking group?  He's smiling.  He's having a good time.  Fucking,  do that with a fucking  yellow face  and Chinese teeth.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that could be a problem.  They wouldn't fucking dare.  They wouldn't fucking dare.  You can't even curse 
[01:20:30]  in the Major League.  You gotta come out  and apologize  if you're caught cursing  on fucking camera.  We apologize  for something  you might have heard.  Yeah, yeah.  I agree with that part of it.  I think there's  a huge hypocrisy.  I don't care.  Right.  Like, I could care less  if they literally  put Sambo  on the side of a helmet  and let the team  play like that.  Yeah, I wouldn't either.  I don't find  any of it offensive.  Right.  Even personally,  I could give a shit  if they put, you know,  the fucking, yeah. 
[01:21:00]  The Dago's  and just had some  fucking guinea up there  eating a slice of pizza  or some linguine.  It doesn't matter.  Oh, wow.  The 1946 to 1951  is pretty bad, too.  Yeah, but I mean,  look at the difference.  But I guess that's  honoring the heritage.  Like, who the hell  the fuck are they kidding?  Yeah, yeah.  It's not honoring  the heritage.  No, I don't think  it was meant to be racist.  I don't think the design  of it was to be racist  or hateful at all.  I really don't.  I think it was meant like,  hey, man, these are Indians.  We're just going to use them 
[01:21:30]  like we would use  any other group.  But again,  when you get to a point  where you're fucking  such cowards,  well, then I guess  you better fucking be fair  and treat everybody properly.  Well, that ain't going to happen.  Oh, they'll change that.  It's all based on...  Guarantee you that goes away.  It's all based on...  That'll absolutely go away.  They put out a survey  at all their season ticket holders  asking what they think  of that, of the logo.  Yeah.  And what'd they say?  I mean, it just came out.  Like, it's the end of the year survey.  That's the first...  They will absolutely  get rid of it.  But I think fans would be like, 
[01:22:00]  no, I like it.  Fans don't care.  They don't like changing it.  Yeah, they don't want to change it.  Yeah.  95% of them are going to say no.  Leave it.  Most Indians probably don't care  that much, to be honest with you.  Most don't, right?  And again, that's like  most black people,  if they hear other black people  using horrible, derogatory slurs,  it doesn't matter.  They don't care.  I love what Barkley said.  He goes,  the white community  is not going to tell me  the way I can talk  around my friends.  I love that.  You're right.  He's the best.  I love that.  Yeah.  It's the same thing 
[01:22:30]  Matt Wilbin.  Wilbin?  Wilborn?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Wilbon said on ESPN.  ESPN.  Do we have that?  Yeah.  I'd love to hear that.  He's a black guy.  He's a sports writer.  He's great.  He's great.  By the way,  and that's the only people  and I love the fact  that these guys  like the mayor of Philadelphia,  the only fucking people  who can talk about race  in a non-groveling way  and the press doesn't get on them  are black guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that's not their fault.  That's the white press.  The fucking media  that just will not  will not fucking  weigh it out 
[01:23:00]  in context  and the second you're white  and you use certain words,  you're just evil  and you need to be fired  and banished from the country.  And it's a lie though  because they're the same white people  and again,  it was Patrice  or somebody  that pointed out  not the Natalie Holloway disappearance  but the soldier.  There was a black female soldier  who was missing early on  and then  when that was the Jessica,  the other one  who was missing,  remember the famous soldier  who was  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  they rescued. 
[01:23:30]  How fast  did that white face  knock that black one  out of the fucking news?  And every missing kid  that's famous  it's always a beautiful  little white face.  These are white reporters.  This is the same mentality  that's doing this  that is acting like  they give a fuck  about the word nigger.  It's fake.  Another prime example is  if there was a mall shooting  in Jersey  you know,  he wound up  just killing himself.  Yeah.  The amount of helicopters 
[01:24:00]  and police cars  and emergency units  and SWAT teams  the constant coverage  for hours on end.  Meanwhile,  in Chicago  on any given weekend  you have at least  six to eight people killed  14 to 20 people  wounded by gunfire.  They're all black.  They were shot  by other black people  and nary a mention  on the news.  Maybe the local  Chicago news  but as far as  national news goes  nothing.  It's still  people dying. 
[01:24:30]  It's still gunfire  which the news  loves publicizing  gunfire  when it's white people  shooting at other people.  And they could call it  a mass shooting  or a crazy  you know,  white guy  with a manifesto  or school shooting.  Oh,  they love a good  school shooting.  Unless it's an  inner city school  and it's gang related  then again  you won't hear about it.  It's the hypocrisy  and bullshit  and acceptance.  And they are  the most racist 
[01:25:00]  because they're  the ones going  well,  it's expected of them.  It's not news.  It's not even  deemed newsworthy  by them  because  eh,  you know,  those people.  And that's exactly  what they're doing.  And they're more  offensive  than some guy  just dropping  some n-bombs  or fucking  whatever.  It's a lot  more offensive  what they're doing.  And a lot more  detrimental to the  community  what they're doing  than one guy  fucking yelling  at somebody  that cut him off  with a slur. 
[01:25:30]  Do we have Alex  that's me?  I want to get  unfortunate.  You know who that was?  Mitch Kumpstein.  You said one guy.  Yes, one guy.  Anthony Cumia.  You want to hear  Alec Baldwin?  You want to hear  Matt Wilbon?  Let's hear Matt Wilbon  talking about  using the n-word.  Ooh, n-word.  Well, but there are  two issues here.  The use of the  inflammatory n-word  and the notion that  Barnes is sick of  his soft teammates  which you want first.  Well, I'm going to  dismiss the first one  first.  You know, people can  be upset with me  if they want.  I, like a whole lot 
[01:26:00]  of people, use the  n-word all day,  every day, my whole  life.  All day, every day.  If he wants to use  it, I got no  problem with that.  Publicly, I wouldn't  do that, but I have  no issue with it.  Okay?  Good for him.  We'll get back to  that.  I like it.  Yeah.  I like it.  Good for him.  Good for him.  He went off on  more of it.  I think that his  wallet is going to  be tremendously  lighter as a result  of doing something  like this.  I'm not going to  get into an  argument as to  who can and  who can't use  that word.  Yeah.  But I'm going to  tell you, if I'm 
[01:26:30]  the commissioner  of the NFL or  the NBA or  Major League  Baseball, I'm  going to make  the following  stand.  I don't care.  Yeah, Tony  Kornheiser.  It's pardon the  interruption.  Okay.  Now, would he be  saying that same  thing if it was a  fucking white guy  saying he used it  all day, every day?  Like, hey, I'm not  going to jump in and  say who can use that  word and who can't.  Why don't you fuck?  This is why I fucking  hate these guys.  The black guy said  something absolutely  legit and right.  So why are you  fucking, well, I'm  not going to say who  can use that word and  who can't.  Where's your fucking 
[01:27:00]  balls, motherfucker?  Why don't you tell  him, hey, I think  that word is wrong.  Yeah, if he was  doing a story on  Paula Deen, would  he be saying this  right now?  There you go.  Would he be saying  that?  No.  I don't know.  There you go.  The hypocrisy is  fucking infuriating.  Another fucking white  guy who's probably  never had an honest  racial conversation  with a black guy  in his life.  If the black  players, which is  probably 80% in  the NFL, in that  Miami Dolphin  locker room, had a  problem with Richie  Incognito saying the  N-word, they would  have told him to  stop and he would  have stopped.  Yeah.  He would have  stopped in a second. 
[01:27:30]  He's outnumbered.  Yeah.  And seriously, he  would have said,  all right, that's  cool, all right, I'm  not going to cause  any problems in the  locker room, I'll  stop saying it.  They even came out  and said, look, we  had no problem with  him saying that.  That's what we do.  Yeah, if we did, we  would have told  him.  Yeah, the reaction  between a black  person using a racial  slur and a white  person, it's just, I  mean, Paula  Dean, that she said  nigger 30 years ago. 
[01:28:00]  It could have been in  a joke when she was  12 that her dad told  her.  It didn't matter.  She never even had to  say that she said it.  That's how long ago it  was.  In a deposition, so it  wasn't even like it was  public.  It shouldn't have even  been public.  In a deposition, and  she gets crucified, just  thrown a, it doesn't  make sense.  There's no consistency.  But the subtlety of  what he just did, don't  miss it, because that's  the shit that's going to  get all you guys at  work who think that we  harp on this too much,  and then cry when your 
[01:28:30]  fucking Facebook gets  you fired.  Right.  This is the type of  subtlety that's at work.  This is the type of  stuff, like, you know,  you'll post something  innocent that you heard  your black friend say  and that he's not  offended by, and some  fucking, some white  jizz bag like this  will come in and not  hold you to, will hold  you to a higher standard  and as a result, you  lose your fucking gig.  Yeah, yeah.  Play that again if you  can.  Yeah, yeah, I want to  hear that again.  The lack of balls to  tell a black guy how he  can discuss Ray is  fucking, yeah.  And by the way, that's  the right way to do it.  You shouldn't care.  No. 
[01:29:00]  I think that his wallet is  going to be tremendously  lighter as a result of  doing something like this.  I'm not going to get into  an argument as to who can  and who can't use that  word.  Yeah.  But I'm going to tell  you, if I'm the  commissioner of the NFL  or the NBA or Major League  Baseball, I'm going to  make the following stand.  I don't care that that  word is used among  friends.  I don't care it's used in  film.  I don't care it's used in  music.  You ain't going to use it  here publicly anymore.  We're not going to have  it publicly. 
[01:29:30]  What?  This is the insanity.  What?  This is the insanity of  fucking political  correctness.  Yes.  The white guy is arguing  against the word nigger to  make the black guy think,  wow, he's a really good  white guy.  Yes.  This is the insanity of  this country.  And that is the whole  fucking thing.  And it's not the only  time.  What was it we heard last  week?  Yes.  We heard it last week.  Look at me.  Look at me.  I'm a good white guy.  I won't have that life. 
[01:30:00]  And the black guy is  being honest.  I'll use it all day,  every day.  All day,  every day.  He probably calls his  garbage can that.  Whatever.  Just everything.  The fucking faucet.  Give me some water,  nigga.  You know,  you're just fucking  everything.  All day.  What white guy did  this last week?  It was another white guy  that did this while  talking with a black  player, I think.  It was when Barkley  was saying it.  Or somebody,  I forget who he was  talking to,  but it was another  one of these fucking  these cornball  white guys  arguing, 
[01:30:30]  over arguing  against it  while a black guy  was giving you  reasons why he  doesn't care about it.  Over arguing.  It comes off as so  fucking phony.  So worried of how  you're going to look.  So worried that you're  going to seem like  you're okay with that  word that your boss  is going to fire you.  I understand you could  use it,  and I'm not going to  say who can and  can,  but not in front of  me,  pally.  The fucking white guy  acting offended by  the word nigger  talking to the black  guy who's saying he  uses it.  What a fucking  fake country. 
[01:31:00]  It's astounding  when you actually  spell it out and put  it that way.  It's ridiculous.  The fraudulent,  like what's happening  to us that we walk  around in a,  we're on a movie  set.  It's a movie.  None of us are being  honest.  No,  no.  Habit.  Publicly,  I can see what I'm  saying.  I have a problem  with,  and excuse me here,  white people framing  the discussion for the  use of the n-word.  Thank you.  Those I might be  related to and close, 
[01:31:30]  close friends with.  It is.  So I got that issue.  It is so much in the  public now.  It's inflammatory.  I know.  You know what?  Everybody's going to  have to compromise a  little bit.  Here's part of the  compromise.  David Stern and I  almost said Paul  Tagley,  but Roger Goodell.  Wait, pause again.  I just want to hear,  did the white guy just  say everybody's going  to have to compromise?  Yes.  So basically you're  talking to somebody.  Yeah.  Now reverse the  situation and the  black guy and the  white guy are talking  and the white guy  says,  I don't like black  people framing this  language.  You're never going to  hear that on television.  No,  never.  But this subtlety, 
[01:32:00]  and this black guy's  being,  what's his name?  Matt Wilbon.  I think he's being  honest and just  speaking,  being truthful and  he's not fucking,  he's being completely  rational.  But the white guy  saying there's going  to have to be  compromise means he  wants the black guy  to like knock it  off.  Or he wants to,  no,  he wants the black  guy to be able to  say it and he  doesn't want to say  that you can't,  it's just,  it's such eggshell  walking with a guy  who's not asking you  to walk on eggshells.  No,  no.  No,  he's fine with it.  Oh,  I don't have to 
[01:32:30]  compromise.  Why?  Why?  Why don't you just  sit there and go,  why do you care if  white people frame  the discussion?  Black people,  the NAACP are the  ones who retired the  word,  not me.  Yeah,  yeah.  Fuck,  I hate white people.  I really do.  I wish I was black  so I could hate  white people legitimately.  Well,  they made a bit,  when that Riley Cooper  guy from the Eagles  said,  you know,  had that video of  the N-Mart,  they're like,  he's never going to  put the first,  he's never going to  play in the NFL again.  What team would  take him?  Yeah,  yeah.  His career's over.  Who knows what,  he's 24 years old.  Meanwhile,  you know,  he just went away  for three days  so the press would 
[01:33:00]  just like,  and the guy's like,  you know,  third leading receiver  in the NFL right now.  Yeah,  there's no real outreach.  He has no problem  with it.  The black guys  aren't going,  I'm showering in the  other locker room  because I don't  want to be near him.  No,  if anything,  he'll say that.  Who wants those  big black dicks  in your face?  Especially after you  say that word  and you're packing  six in a fucking  NFL locker room.  Holy shit.  So much in the  public now.  You know what?  And everybody's  going to have to  compromise a little bit.  Here's part of the  compromise.  David Stern  and I almost said 
[01:33:30]  Paul Tagley,  but Roger Goodell  and it bleeds  over the bus ceiling.  They need to call  some people who look  a little different  from them in  to make that call  to figure out  how we're going  to address this.  But unilaterally  sitting on high  telling black folks  how to speak  and use the N-word  that doesn't go.  But you agree  that publicly  I would not have used it.  I'm not.  I would have said  and I know Matt Barnes.  I would have said  Matt,  not publicly  and he's apologized.  Yeah.  But he's kind of right. 
[01:34:00]  It's like the nerve  of fucking white people  and this really does  framing the discussion.  But again,  that's  and this is where  this dude  Wilpon has to  acknowledge  it's a reaction.  It's a panicked  white reaction.  Yes, it is.  From the NAACP  and from guys  like Al Sharpton  and from Jesse Jackson.  This is not just  white people deciding.  It's a panicked response.  Everyone's petrified  of getting fired.  And if you look at it  they don't want  white people framing  what black people  can say.  I don't like it 
[01:34:30]  the other way around either.  I don't like black people  framing what I can say  and losing  your job,  your fucking home,  whatever the fuck else  you could lose  for it  by saying words  that black people  deem offensive  and then that white people  just pump up  to a level of  you know,  oh, don't even think it.  And the brilliant Patrice  saw this.  Patrice said  when it first started happening  I think the NAACP  retired the word.  He goes,  it's crazy.  Do you think  and he was talking  to other black people  he said,  do you think white people  are going to let you  say something  they can't say? 
[01:35:00]  And you know,  he was coming at it  from a different angle  but he was right.  Do you think that's going to  of course not.  Everyone's going to have  to be penalized  a little bit for it.  And now black guys  are going,  you're telling me  I can't say nigga?  Fuck you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just like  the white people  get offended by a black joke  in a comedy club.  I don't like that.  No, I'm not laughing.  And then I'm like,  okay, so then  this is what you do.  If you're so,  when you're leaving  the parking lot  and you see a bunch  of thugs falling  when you don't lock  your doors.  Yeah, leave your window  open.  Leave your window  and don't lock your,  don't run into your car 
[01:35:30]  and hurry up  and lock your doors  because that's racist.  That's terrible.  You're saying that  black people  are going to mug you  and jump in your car  and carjack you.  Don't lock the door then.  When you're walking  out of Walmart  and you see a couple  black people behind you,  young black kids,  do you rush to your car  and all of a sudden  lock the door right away?  Don't do that then.  Don't clutch your purse.  You don't know,  even know what,  saying like,  it's a bad neighborhood.  You don't know  what that means  because you wouldn't,  you wouldn't say  that one neighborhood  is bad  and another one is good.  Oh, it's a bad neighborhood.  What do you mean? 
[01:36:00]  They wouldn't even  understand that  because they're so,  crime has nothing to do with it.  It's just crime.  It's just crime  and poverty.  Poverty.  Shut the fuck up.  I mean,  that may be  the basic problem of it,  but I mean,  that's,  they just deny  that fucking little thing  in themselves.  I don't get it.  And the denial sometimes  is so painful  to watch somebody  as they're trying  to convince other people  that they've never  even thought the word.  I love that one.  No, 
[01:36:30]  it's like,  you never,  I never even thought it.  No,  no,  I haven't.  Please.  Everyone's at least  thought it.  Yeah,  and again,  even if you haven't,  a lot of people  haven't said that word  in anger.  There are people  that don't say it,  but don't,  don't act like  you haven't said  other stuff.  Yeah,  yeah,  that too.  Sure.  We're in a fucking,  it's,  it's literally  a movie.  We're all,  we're all make pretending  with each other  about everything.  The word faggot  and this  and all these  unpopular,  inappropriate words. 
[01:37:00]  No one's being truthful  with each other  and just,  just kind of breathing  and relaxing  and just living.  We're all just fucking  pointing at each other  you said it,  you said it,  you said it.  What a country of liars.  You said it.  I know.  Where's this sensitivity  training that people  are going to  to get in trouble?  Yeah,  I almost want to try it once.  Yeah,  I'd love to.  Where is this class?  Where do they go?  Yeah,  where is it held?  Who does it?  Who teaches it?  They'll start building  schools soon.  Sensitivity training school. 
[01:37:30]  So you gotta go to  almost like a rehab,  a 30 day rehab.  Good industry  to start up,  I guess.  And then when people,  I love when they come at you  from this angle.  Why do you need to say it?  Like they come at you  from that angle,  like almost like you're  parading around  with a flag yelling,  I want to say nigger  all the time.  Yeah.  So not about the word.  It's about the nerve  of fucking us  to think that we're  an honest and consistent  country.  When we are constantly  dictating that one group  can do and say something  and yet another group  cannot do and say something.  You're penalized here  and you're not penalized there  and we don't say it. 
[01:38:00]  We pretend that we're fair  instead of being honest.  It's arbitrary  and it's selective.  But we all,  but then everybody  preaches equality  and let's all be the same  and we're not  and it's ridiculous.  We fucking talked  about democracy overseas  and fucking anything  with a vagina  couldn't vote.  Yeah.  And that's the mild part  of being a woman over there.  Not vote.  They're like,  okay,  just don't cut my clit out.  I'm fine with not voting.  No, no,  I'm saying like  we police the world  and tell everybody  how to be.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:38:30]  Blacks couldn't vote.  Women couldn't vote.  We've been full of shit  always with this stuff.  Always.  Full of shit.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just babbling.  I apologize.  No, it's great.  I'm coffeed out.  I love it.  And my theory  with the redskin thing,  if you're a white person  and you're like,  no, just,  I feel bad for American  and just get rid of their name.  I feel bad for them.  Then give them back  your fucking land.  Seriously,  if you're living  on a piece of land  that was stolen,  then give them  the keys to your house.  Are you going to do,  oh, no,  I'm not going to do that.  I was doing that  with my mother-in-law.  She's like,  that's ridiculous. 
[01:39:00]  I go, no, it's not.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because if you're really bad,  so you're just going to get,  so as soon as it pertains to you,  affects you personally,  then you go,  no, no, no, no,  we're not going to do that.  That's way worse.  If you,  Paula,  every Native American,  do you want a fucking piece of land  on the Jersey Shore  or do you want the redskin name removed?  We'll see what they go for.  I'll take the keys  to the fucking house.  Yeah, no, shit.  If you feel that bad,  give me your fucking land back.  Yeah, the, uh...  Yeah, we'll destroy your little bone.  Here's a little redskin name.  We'll get rid of it.  We'll change it.  We're not going to do that.  No way.  Yeah, well, 
[01:39:30]  and it affects you personally.  That's the big issue.  But everybody wants to come off  looking like they're holier than thou  and good  and, you know,  everyone's a fucking scumbag.  Please,  let's be real here.  I don't know how people do it.  I don't know how, like,  sometimes the audience is like,  we can say shit they can't say  at our jobs.  How the fuck do you guys work  in cubicles  and in corporations  and deal with this shit?  You just have to whisper.  Make sure you're not seen  or video recorded by somebody.  The dumb phones.  Emails.  You're trying to send an email.  Right, right.  Just a funny picture. 
[01:40:00]  Now your email gets out.  A goofy picture  you want to send out.  Look at this guy.  Yeah, you want to smoke  a little crack.  No?  If I have a quick comedy,  I would just go to  a construction site.  I'd work with a bunch of guys  and spackling  and putting wood up  and just...  And putting the roof up  and just saying  anything we want.  Blurring shit out.  Exactly.  You know,  I haven't been on a job site  in quite a few years,  but I do remember it being  pretty free and open 
[01:40:30]  with what you can say.  If we ever get to the point  where the foreman  of a construction site  goes to the news  and says,  I can't take this.  The language they're using,  the slurs they're thrown around,  we're fucking finished.  The carpenters  are bullying the cement guys.  I can't...  Someone shit in a spackle bucket  and left it  in the corner of the basement.  Very upset.  I used to shit  in a spackle bucket  and leave it  in my brother's work van.  Yes.  And he'd be driving  down the road.  He had to pull over  on the turnpike one time  because he fucking  ripped everything 
[01:41:00]  out of the van  because there was  all this shit.  He ripped everything out  on the fucking side  of the turnpike  and found my shit  in the spackle.  And he was my boss  and my brother.  Why would I do that to him?  Yeah.  Is he happy?  He was fucking...  He fired me the next day.  He told my mother.  My mother was like,  what's wrong with you?  It's funny.  This guy was in  a little bathroom.  It was in the summertime.  There's no electricity  in the house  and he's painting  and I shit in a little  paint can  and I put it in there  because there was garbage  all over there  and the guy  the whole day 
[01:41:30]  is like,  it fucking stinks in here!  And I walk in  and I go,  I don't smell nothing.  Dude,  just fucking deal with it.  He goes,  you don't smell nothing.  I go,  no,  not at all.  I was in there  the whole day.  He found that  at the end of the day  he was miserable.  Another time  there was a refrigerator  and I went in there  the first day  and I saw an empty  ice cube tray  so I pissed  in the ice cube tray  and I just threw it  back in the freezer  just in nothing.  I don't know why  I did it  just to be an idiot.  Three weeks later  we're sitting there  we're eating lunch  and he's drinking iced tea  out of this thing  and I hear ice  I go,  where'd you get  that ice from? 
[01:42:00]  Because it was  one o'clock  in the afternoon  and he's like,  I threw some ice  in the freezer  and I just took it  from there.  I couldn't say anything  because the guy  was bigger than me.  Holy shit,  he drank your  piss ice cubes.  And I'm still  friends with him  to this day  and I broke the news  to him on stage  at the Stress Factory  in front of a sold out crowd  in front of his wife  and everybody else  and his friends  that he drank  my piss ice cubes.  Was he mad?  He's still fucking pissed.  Yeah, job sites 
[01:42:30]  are fucking  like just savages.  It's like Lord of the Flies  in there.  You're just shitting  and pissing everywhere.  There's no,  no one cares  about political correctness  or what you're talking about  and there's such a hierarchy  of trades  on there  like the carpenters  look down  upon the fucking  like the concrete workers  and the laborers  and then the electricians  look down  on the carpenters  and it's,  yeah,  pretty amazing  a little microcosm  of life 
[01:43:00]  on the job sites.  I think everyone  should do it.  And the tin knockers  of course  were pieces of shit.  That's what I was  the air conditioning  and heating guys.  You're in the work van  all day  and you just  you're cranky  you hate your life  it was the worst  you hung over  it was the worst  fucking gig.  Were you ever hung over  when you were working?  Oh,  constantly  constantly hung over  and just  and the loud work van  hit those bumps  and it's just  all those  shoddily put together 
[01:43:30]  racks that are  in the back of the van  and they would just  be loud  when you're hung over  and  did you ever not  want to go to work?  Every day  and drive into the job  you just didn't  want to get there  because you just knew  that you had to  fucking start working  once you got there.  I know,  you hope if a trap  anyway you could stop  and maybe Home Depot  first and pick up  some supplies  kill some time.  And then when it was  just fucking  freezing cold  and you have to get out  of the nice warm van  and there's just no heat  now you're just  working in the  freezing fucking cold. 
[01:44:00]  Putting all those  layers on.  Oh,  all the layers.  Get long johns on maybe.  And God forbid  you knock your finger  with a hammer  or anything in that cold  it could be nothing.  Just a little flick  on your finger.  It was a horrid pain.  It really is a terrible  way to make a living.  That's why you don't  see many real old  construction guys.  I used to work  for this landscaper guy  he was older than me  and he was single  at the time.  Every time  if I got him laid  he would give me  a dollar an hour more.  I started at like 
[01:44:30]  six bucks  because I used to  work at this rock club  at the Birch Hill.  I was a DJ there  so I used to bring  fucking drunk chicks  back to his place.  He lived in his own house  it was almost like a mansion.  At like two in the morning  I'd call him  I'd go look  I got some girls  coming over  because I said  this guy's a record producer  from New York  he produced Metallica.  Did he?  No.  No.  He plants trees.  He had a jacuzzi  in the backyard  I'm like yeah  he's produced Metallica  Anthrax  ACDC  and then I'd call him up  and I'd go dude  I got three of them  coming over  and I fucking hammered  wake him up 
[01:45:00]  and if he got laid  he would give me  a dollar an hour  but then the next day  at work  I'd drive with him  in the van  so I wouldn't be  at the job site  until like two in the afternoon  because he'd have to go  pick up supplies  so I'm like this is  fucking awesome  I don't even have to  get out of the truck.  We just talked about  the chicks  we banged the night before.  One time he had to  put a wig on  because girls said  we only like guys  with long hair  so we got him a wig  at the mall  and he put a fucking wig on  and he banged a chick  with a wig on.  We met him early  in the afternoon  we had lunch with him  and they met him  he had short hair  and a mustache  and they go 
[01:45:30]  we only like guys  with long hair  that's why we like Jim  that's when I had long hair  and he's like really?  Come on  what if a guy's a nice guy?  They're like nope  we only like long hair  so that night  I said look  my friend's having a party  he's a producer of Metallica  he fucking put a wig on  and eight hours later  the same guy  with the fucking beard mustache  put a wig on  they didn't know who it was  and he banged a friend  and I banged the other one  it was beautiful  I told him  I said only hit her from behind  because you don't want to  pull your hair off  no shit  how embarrassing would that be?  I got to the  I brought props 
[01:46:00]  I got to the house  I brought the new Metallica record  he said oh cool  meanwhile the guy  liked fucking Barry Manilow  he hated metal  he's like oh this is great  just a new one?  he's like  what a fucking scam  you guys are really  running fucking scams  hard to pull that off  with fucking Google now  that's where fucking Google  would be a disadvantage  when they start  Googling your name  and they realize  oh he's not a producer  because he fired up  the jacuzzi  at like two in the morning  even if it was the winter time  he was right in his backyard  and I bring him all the way up  my girls you want a drink  my friend lives ten minutes away 
[01:46:30]  let's go  okay  wow  that's great  but he had the wig on  eight hours later  didn't even know it was him  do you ever see Jim with long hair?  do you remember Jim with long hair?  I remember Jim with long hair  do you have any photos?  where can we find a photo  of you with long hair?  that's how I knew Jim  was fucking  yeah yeah  when did you cut that?  I don't know  I kind of remember  like 95  something like that  you cut it that many years ago?  wow really it was?  yeah  yeah it was around that  95, 96  oh my god  no I couldn't have  because when was Woodstock 
[01:47:00]  because it was still along at Woodstock  94  yeah so yeah about 95, 96  that was 94  I gotta find the original picture  because I cut Don's head off in it  I feel bad  it was when it came out  in my book  that picture of me  you and Voss  from Woodstock 94  wow  that's pretty cool though  oh yeah  I'm wearing my  clockwork orange shirt  Jim's got long hair  Voss has got a ponytail  and Don is sitting on this lumber  but they cut his head off  and I want to get him  you know  I have to get the original  to get his head back in there  Voss had his little ponytail  oh yeah  it was a complete fucking

[01:48:00]  gotta go to image  Woodstock  was it fun?  to hang with the guys  was but  remember the guy  with the big cock  the African guy  in the tent?  oh yeah  we were in a performer tent  we didn't have to  actually stay in a  regular tent  and it was this  like African dude  that was in some  tribe band  or something  whoa  and he was in a tent  with us  and the guy  was just walking around  like his tighty whities  and he had the  hugest package  and he was just  hanging out  just playing his bongos  and me and Jim 
[01:48:30]  just kept walking by  and staring at him  and he would fall asleep  on his back  and he was wearing  these little shorts  and the balls  and all the comedians  would march by him  because Levy was up  doing coke off his license  at 3 o'clock in the morning  oh shit  I'll never forget  sleeping next to Bob Levy  and he's fucking  propped up on his elbow  and he's got coke  on the end of the line  and he's doing it  and I'm like  what are you doing?  we're all going to bed  holy shit  Jeff Lipschultz  who was Jeff Ross  his real name is Lipschultz  he was up there at the time  and Brick Mason  remember Brick Mason?  and then there was a thing  where with the performers  there was a shower 
[01:49:00]  male and female  it was a co-ed shower  so remember we saw  a hot chick walk in there  I took like 7 showers  the first day  just to fucking sear  yeah constantly  but then I had to go  to the side  to get it a little hard  I wanted to have  at least 4 going in  you gotta fucking  yeah I was only  packing like maybe  maybe an inch  you gotta pull  in a shower  so I plumped up  and then I went in there  and I was always just  kept scrubbing away  and scrubbing away  we had a guy  just waiting by the showers  like another one walked in  and I'm like  Brick Mason  that was Brick  yeah  and the chicks  were just fucking  yeah 
[01:49:30]  they didn't even care  they were hot too  yeah  because they were  the performer chicks  or whatever  I mean there was  that one guy  with the giant cock  he was a little  fucking white dude  I remember Levy  was so funny  Levy goes  they booed me  out of the shower  yeah  that's right  he booed me  out of the shower  he was a little  skimpy white guy  and he probably  had 7 soft  it was fucking  humiliating  ah well  try to find it  we'll take a break  and see if we can  I'm so mad  I can't fucking

[01:52:00]  that was considered  a cheek peak  and that means  he had a shower there  so I'd have to watch  Jim walk  and see if the girl  looked at his ass  and then report  when he came back  did you ever get  cheek peaks  yeah because  if they did look  then I knew  alright she's interested  so then I would  go back over  come back around  and start rapping with her  what a great plan  but Florentine  you never had to  look out in case  Norton was getting  a cheek peak  uh no  it didn't happen  well see cause I wore  tight pants  so you know  when you're wearing  tight pants  chicks used to always  look at your ass  when you wore tight pants  cause that goes in  during the day  yeah  so it was like

[01:57:00]  what's her name  Melissa Bachman  Melissa Bachman  and she's been  catching some  holy hell  you know  I love my guns  oh boy  do I love shooting  but I don't like  shooting  animals  I don't hunt  it makes me feel bad  I have hunted  in the past  when I was like  a kid  dad would take me  out  go ahead  kill something  alright  I gotcha  and then I would  feel like  ugh 
[01:57:30]  got that gloomy  like ew  you killed something  feeling  for no reason  yeah  well I used to  eat the little  bunny rabbits  that we shot  yeah but it was  still a happy  little bunny rabbit  a minute ago  yeah that's true  you could have  gone to the  supermarket  let somebody else  do the dirty work  can't get rabbit  at the supermarket  really  not back then  not there  not at Vons  in San Juan Capistrano  no rabbit  at Vons  but it was  kind of a  cool thing  back then  I still didn't  like it  but it was  I don't know 
[01:58:00]  you shoot a little  rabbit  you skin him  fucking  chop him up  and cook him  and then eat him  that was kind of  rugged  as a kid  you're kind of like  oh this is cool  you know  but  that lion shot  is just ridiculous  something tells me  the lion looks so  peaceful there too  I know  it almost looks like  the lion wasn't  doing anything wrong  why'd you do that  that's why  yeah  and something tells me  that no matter  how many lions  there are now  there's probably  not enough where  people should be 
[01:58:30]  going around  shooting  right yeah  the zebra too  there's a picture  of a zebra too  I'm gonna say this  for the record  I hope she's  fucking killed  by an animal  she's hunting  wow  I hope this pig  is fucking hunting  an animal  and it kills her  that doesn't hurt  her tits  I actually hope  she lives  let me  thank you for that  fucking  let's do a  course correction  I hope those  big dumb tits  are ripped off  by a wild animal  and she fucking  lives  wow  really  I hope this  fucking 
[01:59:00]  balding cunt  I hope her  and her fucking  shitty hairline  are mauled  by a wild animal  fuck her  okay so Jim  fuck her  and her shitty  hairline  let's cut to  three days later  she's at the comedy  cell and she's a  fan of yours  and she wants  to fuck you  then I fucking  take back  everything I just  said  and I fucking  I give her  a horrible  sexual performance  I look at her  stupid photos  I pretend I'm not  revolted  I eat her ass  and then I fucking  bash her again  when I come back  to work  fuck her 
[01:59:30]  and her giant  oval face  hunting is my  life  well then you know  what if hunting  is your life  your life has  amounted to  nothing  you've amounted  to nothing  if that's your  life hunting  big game  you're fucking  valueless  you know what  I wouldn't mind  so much  if it was  you go out  you head out  into the brush  with a knife  in your teeth  and you have to  take down the lion  that way  jump on him  and stab him  to death  before he kills  you  with that rifle 
[02:00:00]  she's got  wow  you know  yeah she's just  one of these  fucking broads  that needs  daddy's approval  maybe daddy  wanted his son  or whatever it  was  she just wants  mail approval  and that's why  she's out doing  a big guy thing  I don't know  a lot of people  are fine with this  I know they are  I understand that  go to Jersey  and Pennsylvania  we got deer  out the ass  where we need  to get rid of them  lions aren't  running out  onto the highways 
[02:00:30]  lions seem like  they're endangered  I don't know  what the official  numbers are  but if you ask me  with all the  fucking land  that's been  just developed  and such  I don't think  lions  are really as  numerous as they  could be  that's what's so  sick  there's a different  first of all  you'd walk up  to a deer  most people  don't run  when there's a deer  but they have  fucking big  brass balls  with a gun  when they see  a lion  hunting a male  lion like that  what a fucking  pig this woman  is 
[02:01:00]  what a horrible  pig of a woman  I hope she's mauled  that would be a  great example  for people  I hope her tits  are ripped off  by a lion  and then he  leaves her there  fuck her  the lion goes  back to his den  and mounts her  tits on the wall  like she does  with the heads  would that be great  god does that  make me angry  it's such a  murderous  empty thing to do  you're such a  non-contributor  if that's what  your life is  that you like  to describe  and shoot shit  you're a  non-contributor  huntress in hot 
[02:01:30]  water  I do not  understand the  problem  Africa makes  big bucks  from people  hunting the  animals over there  if they do not  like her  shooting the  lions  then change  the law  do not  take it  out on her  they're shitty  but so is she  we're not  we're not saying  that she's to  blame for all  the problems  we are  and by the way  I fault  Africa less  people who are  starving to death  it's hard for me  to criticize a poacher  when his family  probably has eaten  fucking toenails  for three weeks  and they live  with lions  then this woman  going over there  and fucking doing it 
[02:02:00]  because she thinks  it makes her  something that she's not  you're fucking  valueless  if that's your life  you're shit  I'm sure she sees it  as she's an adventurer  you know  a big game hunter  like the old days  I don't have a problem  with somebody who shoots  venison or shoots a deer  like Ted Nugent  I find to be annoying  but like Jim said  there's an abundance  of deer somewhere  and if you kill it  and you bring it home  and you open it  and you eat it  I find that motivation  he's feeding a lot of people  that normally wouldn't eat  too with what he hunts 
[02:02:30]  but I'm sure he wouldn't be  against sportsman hunting  I'm sure he wouldn't either  but I find the motivation  to be a little different  in that  so it's not so much  what's happening  it's the motivation  behind what you're hunting for  and the rarity  of the animal  it's just something  so piggish  about this fucking  this shitty hairline  fucking big oval faced  cunt  sitting there  on this fucking  beautiful animal  that's dead  do it while he's alive  oh well that would be rough  go sit on him 
[02:03:00]  while he's alive  courage  yeah you shot that  fucking gun  from a hundred yards away  you weren't that brave  yeah hidden in the bushes  king of extinction  lions could be gone  in 10 to 20 years  they're not on the  extinct  or the  the extinction  endangered list  endangered list  they're on the vulnerable list  oh vulnerable  there's apparently  32 to 35,000  I'm very vulnerable  right now  yeah  so they're not getting  into relationships  right now  no  they're very vulnerable  not right now  no  I don't want to  wow that's  what's the deal  with Africa 
[02:03:30]  you're able to pay  a bunch of money  over there  and you can just  hunt whatever the  fuck you want  there's no laws  or anything  I know they got  the big reserves  over there  where I'm sure  you can't hunt  but are there  other areas  that are owned  by people  that you can just  fucking hunt  on their land  probably  isn't that what  Trump Jr. did  I think Trump Jr.  got in some shit too  because he was doing  some hunting over there  I don't think he was  shooting lions  I think he was  shooting those big  fucking dumb  things that look like  giant deer 
[02:04:00]  with funny hairdos  you want to  try talking to  somebody who  disagrees with Jim  sure  pop him on  and I know  there's plenty  of people  that disagree  with me  Adam  hi Adam  in New Jersey  what's going on  guys  I want to  argue with Jimmy  for a little bit  as a hunter  myself  I just don't get  why he's got  this hatred  for something  he doesn't agree  with  considering it's  Jimmy  like he's never  disapproving of  much  I'll tell you  why  I'll tell you  why  because you're  fucking  whoever's doing  it is 
[02:04:30]  murdering an  animal  it's like  it's a  it's not  to eat  and I'm not  talking about  people like  I eat meat  I'm not a  fucking animal  rights activist  where I go  meat is murder  I'm not  irrational  even though  I know I'm  a little bit  of a hypocrite  there  but I'm  talking about  people that  go out  and they go  on these  safaris  to make  their life  a little  exciting  and their  idea of  being excited  is to pick up  a gun  and shoot  something  that they  wouldn't dare  confront  without them  and it just  makes me sick  it's like  why don't you  just go out  and punch  a retarded  guy  like really  or go punch 
[02:05:00]  a little  where do I  get my license  for that  or go punch  a little kid  or an old  lady  is there a season  for that in  New Jersey  apparently that's  being done  all over the  country  it's called  the knockout  game  that's where  my hatred  of this  comes from  this fucking  balding woman  sitting there  proud of  murdering this  fucking great  fucking animal  that did nothing  to her  I think if  you could  classify the  animal as  majestic  then there's  a problem  I don't think  a cow is  majestic  so I'll eat  the shit  out of one  of those  if people  were just  murdering cows 
[02:05:30]  and leaving  them there  and posing  with them  and they were  endangered  I'd fucking  hate people  too  but no one's  scared to walk  up to a cow  no one's  scared to walk  up to a deer  I've turned  on fucking  why is it a  confrontational thing  I mean I agree  to the extent  of like I'm not  out killing lions  I eat everything  I try to shoot  I'm um  you know  a hunter in Jersey  all we get  are deer  and bear  but I could  see why people  do it for sport  it goes back  to a basic need  I mean you have  a problem  with Ted Nugent  Jimmy  you don't like  Ted Nugent 
[02:06:00]  is that it  my issue  with Ted Nugent  and I've said  this before  he's very  self-righteous  which is annoying  he's a bright  guy  he defends  his points  really well  um  you know  like a lot  of people  who are against  guns  are irrationally  against guns  and Ted Nugent  has all  of his facts  down  so I admire  a lot about  Ted Nugent  and I think  that he eats  and uses  a lot of  what he shoots  I have much  less of a problem  with a guy  that hunts deer  eats the venison  to me the motivation  there is a little  different  you're living  off the land 
[02:06:30]  there's a difference  between that  and being some  fucking twat  male or female  who just goes out  and kills something  because it makes  you feel like  you're valuable  or you think  that's a satisfaction  to your instinct  well how about  you pick up a club  and take something  from somebody  then  that's human instinct  it makes me sick  yeah  I guess so  I mean there's  so many worse  things in the world  to condemn  and you know  and I try to  condemn them too  I eat everything  I try to kill  most of the  you know  but if I had 
[02:07:00]  the opportunity  I think I would  do something  big game too  but you know  it's not like  I don't know  I don't see the  confrontational thing  where like  because I normally  wouldn't walk up  to a lion  it makes it  I mean there's  a brew involved  there  exactly  that's exactly it  how about this  they're still  fulfilling a very  basic need  and I guess  just to get away  because I'm almost  pulling up to my office  I guess to finish up  I mean coming from  Jimmy it's like  we all know Jimmy  and what he's done  and it's just  crazy to hear  someone like  so adamantly  against something 
[02:07:30]  someone else does  because he doesn't  like it or something  I'm again  first of all  I'm right here  you can talk to me  you don't have to  talk about me  like I'm not here  I'm not a fucking  old person  but I fucking  but dude  I bash things  all the time  I bash things  all the time  hey  I'm sorry  I don't need  to pick up a gun  and go out  and shoot something  to make myself  feel valid  that's to me  what that is  you eat things  if you eat  what you shoot  I'm saying  don't shoot a cock  exactly  I don't have an issue 
[02:08:00]  with that  I really don't  but this fucking  this bitch  wants to feel like  what she's got  like a little rush  the next time  you go to Africa  let someone fuck  you without a condom  you want to rush  you want to thrill  you want to take a risk  how about doing that  put your own body  on the line  well I mean  we all have our vices  right Jim  yeah but dude  my vice doesn't  kill people  and I bash  a lot of things  that I hate  now who's being naive  alright Jimmy  I appreciate  what you're saying  Anthony  you gotta try 
[02:08:30]  to build yourself  a 300 blackout AR  put a silencer  on that bitch  you'll love it  yeah sure  in this state  I can't even  buy an AR  oh come on  I've got two of them  and I live in Jersey  yeah dude  in New York State  you're not allowed  to buy ARs anymore  alright well  yeah  believe me  I have  I have four of them  thank you  I'm fine  but I can't buy  any new ones  and silencers  stop it  alright take it easy  I'm kidding  I don't own a silencer  alright punch it out guys  in Jersey  in touch for yourself 
[02:09:00]  illegally  go bye  take care man  people don't know  I was watching um  where'd she shoot that  I'm sorry  was that Africa  oh yeah  okay  no it was fucking  Jersey  lying in Jersey  South Africa  she was at  lying country safari  now there's a petition  online to have her  banned from South Africa  see I guess  you can't start  banning people  it's not about  banning her  it's  ban her from  South Africa  for what  South Africans  let her do it  yeah  yeah yeah  they cost thousands  of dollars  and they'll let  anyone do it  yeah  wow that's worse 
[02:09:30]  than apartheid  it's crazy  that's South Africa  always getting  themselves jammed up  now they're  letting people  South Africans  have begun a petition  to ban her  but  well probably  the citizens  yeah but  still  it's  your government  has made it legal  I wonder if there's  anything over there  you're not allowed  to shoot  that might be  close to being  extinct  white people  like the fucking  rare albino  rhinoceros  maybe  something like  that  but I don't  know if that's 
[02:10:00]  like  Africa is just  the continent  you know  like if  if you have a  country  that doesn't  have any  regulations  I don't care  how endangered  something is  if you live  in a fucking  country that  that doesn't  give a shit  and it's like  goddamn  Thunderdome  they'll let you  do whatever you  want for a price  and there's no one  that could say  the UN could  fucking yell at  you  well we're gonna  sanction you  you ought to  do this  but they can't  make you do  or not do  anything  you're a  sovereign nation  there might be 
[02:10:30]  lions in abundance  there like there  is deer in New  York and Jersey  so they don't  have a problem  with that  so who knows  maybe that  or they're just  so greedy  with getting  cash  a lot of  these nations  you know  I guess  when you  can't build  industry  you have to  default to  killing your  fucking natural  resources  and pocketing  some cash  that way  what are you  gonna do  you don't have  fucking  sewage systems  and enough  food for your  people  build something  for the love  of Christ 
[02:11:00]  stop letting  people kill  your fucking  animals  Christ almighty  goddamn  crazy people  but they might  look at us  like us  you know  everybody  killing deer  here  I know  like in  Costa Rica  I was there  they said  we barely  have any deer  here  because of it  so they might  look at us  like why  are they doing  that  why is there  millions of  people out there  on a weekend  in you know  New York  and New Jersey  in the woods  killing deer  we'd love to  have a few  over here  they only have  like a couple  over there  it's like  in a zoo  they don't even  have an army  in Costa Rica  and you're not 
[02:11:30]  allowed to hunt  in that country  either  really  yeah  we'll take  another phone call  I want to see  what can some  of these hunters  say  a lot of them  disagree with me  I'm sure  Steven in DC  yes  yellow  yeah what's up  man  hey  yeah  I was just  calling in  I was just  getting ready  to go to work  and it turned  on and I was  hearing you guys  conversation  and I tried  to put my  two cents in  I think Ted  is just a badass  I like what he  does  but I agree  I agree with you  guys  if you're going  to waste  the meat  you shouldn't  be out 
[02:12:00]  killing it  but if  you know  I trophy hunt  so when it  comes around  to the big buck  or the elk  big bear  I'm going to  shoot it  if I don't  come across  the big one  I'm still  going to shoot  an animal  because it's  going to put  food on the  table for my  family  and I enjoy  the sport  it's fun to do  I mean get out  there  you know  nature  to me  it's one of  God's gifts  but at the  same time  if you're going  to be wasteful  about it  then you can  go fuck off  because that  roomed it  for everybody  else  and it's  inhumane  you know  what I mean  I don't agree  with it being  one of God's  gifts  because by  that same  mentality 
[02:12:30]  then people  who can take  things from  you  should just  be able to  I don't mean  necessarily you  the guy on  the phone  but I mean  just kind of  you in general  should just be able  to smash your  fucking head  and take it  no there's a  difference between  you know  the humans  and the animal  world  they figure  you know  they are here  for our  consumption  and you know  but God  didn't invent  at our pleasure  but God invented  it  he didn't invent  firearms  to kill the animals 
[02:13:00]  sure he did  yeah and that's not  why other animals  are here for our  pleasure  I mean  some people  look at it  like that  oh yeah  I know  I know  and I just  I don't agree  with that  then why  can I beat  my dog to  death  and go  to jail  because of that  but if I shot  the dog  would it be  okay  but in  you know  China  you could eat  the fucking  dog  it's  what if I tell  them look  I got Korean  neighbors  who are having  a barbecue  this weekend  can I get  out of it  that way  you think  you could  or some  religious  thing  you know  there are 
[02:13:30]  people that  get in  trouble  with practicing  santeria  because they're  choking  the chicken  and you know  they plead  their religion  and when you  mention something  like this  everyone knows  the difference  between  hunting something  and eating it  and just being  some fucking  privileged cunt  again  gender doesn't matter  and going overseas  and just murdering  an animal  because you like  to sit on it  because it's a thrill  fuck you  she's doing that  like people would  hop in a race car 
[02:14:00]  or go flying  things like that  take a risk  with your own body  not the body  of something else  that fucking  that has to  like a lion's  life is not  a great life  you know what I mean  a lion fucking  you know  he's fucking  just sitting there  there's flies on him  all day  you're in a desert  you don't even  hunt  you sit there  you're eating  your own fucking  shitty kids  if you're hungry  and you survive that  and you have to deal  with this fucking  baldy  you imagine  all of a sudden  he probably thought  look at that lion  he's full of flies  I'll bet you 
[02:14:30]  this lion thought  that she was  a fucking ostrich  because her hairline  is so bad  he's probably like  hey there's an ostrich  with big tits  we're gonna eat  great tonight  I hope  I mean it  I hope she is killed  by an animal  she's hunting  I hope a wild boar  drives those giant  fucking teeth  right through her tits  and drags her  to her death  that's something  fuck her man  you're out there  murdering something  I hope it kills you  and it's not like  wherever she's from  she could bring that  meat back home  on the plane  so she's just  killing it and moving on  I don't think you could 
[02:15:00]  take the fresh lion  back on the plane  you're not gonna be  packed that up  in your suitcase  bring it on your carry-on  yeah bringing  fucking meat  from another country  from lion meat  with anthrax on it  or some shit  she's been hunting  her whole life  there's pictures  on her little website  of her as a little kid  holding up  little dead animals  hunting is my life  then your life  has amounted  to absolutely nothing  if that's what  your whole existence  is based on  going into the woods  and just shooting 
[02:15:30]  something that's not  bothering you  you're valueless  wow  and not eating it  just running home  and showing daddy  look what I did daddy  look what I did  I hate these things  in the front  that tell you  that you don't have a son  look what I did  they are tits  I hate these things  oh my god  can you look her up  she obviously has a brother  I don't know  but I mean  is that her  which one is she  I would say 
[02:16:00]  now is she the older  is she the older  androgynous looking thing  or is she  she's in a picture  with her dog  why doesn't she  kill a dog  yeah why not kill that  well the dog  probably helps her hunt  oh look at her  right there  she's got a shotgun  and a little pheasant  is that the daddy  with the son  that could be the dad  with the son  the brother  and the thing  with lumps on the front  daddy with the loved son  and the thing  with front lumps  I wouldn't show daddy 
[02:16:30]  I'm worthy of his love  play with a dollhouse  you fucking idiot  you think maybe  she wanted  the father wanted  uh oh  obviously not  she got the black guy  in the picture  oh no  she was teaching daddy  a little lesson too  there's a couple of fish  there's a duck  poor little duck  there's her with a shotgun  you're thinking  maybe the father  would pay more attention  to her  if she was a guy  so she hates her lumps  in the front  and that fucking  empty slit in the front  she points at it 
[02:17:00]  she just wishes  it was a penis  she probably puts  rubber bands  around her pussy lips  really tight  to try to make them  stretch  and look like a penis  so she could be  what daddy had  kind of wanted  but then when she  got the implant  she was probably  mad at dad  so she's like  well now I'm gonna  grow some big tits  and show dad  and show dad  and then that will  be my identity  I'll be the hot  chick hunter  that will be my  identity  that is the whole thing  she likes being  the hot chick hunter  I think  I have fucking  such a dislike  for her  wow  oh 
[02:17:30]  okay  well that's  Melissa Bachman  but she's in  she's in some Dutch  now  but again  people are  a lot of people  are giving her shit  you know  you should die  fuck off  things like that  but they're also  this is a weird place  where people don't want  to be too critical  for the most part  because it is  kind of a  you know  it's hunting  and I don't know  people are kind of  wishy-washy  and by the way  to the guy  to the little  cunt on Twitter  Wayne Austin  who goes  would Jim 
[02:18:00]  talk to Ted Nugent  this way  first of all  I'm not speaking  to her  I'm speaking  about her  if she was in  the studio  I would disagree  with her  but I would be  more respectful  because again  I didn't attack  Paris Hilton  when she was in here  because she wasn't  being completely rude  and I wasn't afraid  to go after  Jesse Ventura  jerk off  yeah yeah  asshole  he's really brave  when it comes to  women  thank you for your service  I guess Wayne's a hunter  from Georgia  he's an army vet  I respect that  he's still blocked  goodbye cunt  I gotta be honest 
[02:18:30]  with you  I gotta be honest  with you  I respect your service  but you're a cunt  there are plenty  of guys that  are and were  in the military  that are complete  fucking assholes  of course  it doesn't make you  a saint  because you served  it's a good thing  for the country  and there is a  respect there  for the service  but not everyone  that served  is a good  cool stand up  guy  plenty of  shitheads  that wore  the uniform  and yes 
[02:19:00]  blocked  I will block  a motherfucker  I saw that  I was following  your twitter  this weekend  you blocked  a bunch of  people  shit was I  blocking like  crazy this weekend  bam bam bam  because they would  give me shit  about the UFC  thing  racial arguments  let me take my  tweet down  oh what happened  oh that's right  I'm not going to  take it down  I'm going to  insult her again  oh there's video  of her  uh oh  look at her  Jim  fucking epic music 
[02:19:30]  do they show her  killing something  beautiful bear  I'm a hunter  to the core  in fact  hunting has been  a part of my life  since I was a little girl  I was fortunate enough  to grow up in a  hold on a second  can we figure out  why she talks like  she just bit her tongue  how come she  had done CH everything  like she's trying to  talk around like  she just bit her tongue  she speaks a little  weird  yeah she does  talk stupid  yeah  even when my  brother and I  were too young  to actually hunt  my parents still  brought us along 
[02:20:00]  let us take pictures  with their game  and made sure to  always involve us  hunting has always  been a great time  for the family  it didn't really  matter how many  ducks we shot  or how big our  bucks were  it was about  spending the time  together  and doing something  that we all enjoy  that's a great  family unit  yeah I'll bring  on my son to  Chuck E. Cheese  in two hours  today that's how  we're spending  the time together  wouldn't it be cool  if aliens landed  and hunted her  whole family town  like fucking  predator  she's hunting  and it's all 
[02:20:30]  a nice family event  until they become  the hunted  yeah it was a night  what do you think  the fucking deer  are doing you cunt  spending time  with their family  yeah they're just  hanging out  what do you think  that lion would  have been doing  if it wasn't for you  and your fucking  gender crisis  showing up  licking your shitty  balls with flies  around them  absolutely  she probably did  the lion a favor  let's hear more  of her  yeah  I like her dumb  voice  things like  trapping pocket  gophers so they  wouldn't eat the  roots off all the  new trees we planted  was made into a  fun sport 
[02:21:00]  and even as little  kids we were right  there helping out  and learning about  the outdoors  what is she doing  I give my parents  a lot of credit  because I'm sure  it would have been  easier to just  leave us home  but they always  went through the  extra effort to  take us along  and because of that  hunting has become  my passion  someone once told  me if you find  something you love  figure out a way  to make it into  a career  and you'll be  successful because  you'll be doing  what you love  and I couldn't  she's retarded  yeah she really is  I love jerking off 
[02:21:30]  I can't make a dime  on it  exactly  what a fucking pig  this is the weirdest  it's creepy  and if she was a man  I'd be saying the same  thing honestly  it's just more fun  the guy from  Go Daddy  who shot that  elephant  I know he said  the Africans  wanted him to do it  but there's just  something so fucking  so cowardly about it  yeah  it's such a cowardly  and fucking vicious  thing to do  she um  she  that whole thing  where they had 
[02:22:00]  the little gophers  and she was picking  them up out of the  hole with the trap  it's like that's  that's kind of  serial killer-ish  like young kids  and dead animals  I don't know  it's just a weird  kind of creepy  all the serial killers  like Jeffrey Dahmer  and stuff  they all start  on the little  animals  and torture them  the first thing  I ever killed  in my life  I think I was  probably seven years  old  maybe even six  and I had found  a little amphibian 
[02:22:30]  a newt  remember those  little newts  they look like  lizards  but they're amphibians  and it was  on Long Island  in one of the  marshes  back in prehistoric  days  they actually  had like these  things  so I took it  back home  and I was  walking on the  picnic table  in the backyard  and there was  a piece  of a can  a top of a can  that had been  opened with a  can opener  and I took it  and rolled it  like a wheel  right over the  back of this  newt  on the picnic 
[02:23:00]  table  and the thing  actually went  it made a sound  as I cut it  in half  with a rusty  can lid  and this  weird  dark  horrible  feeling  came over  me  at six  years old  that I knew  I had just  done something  terrible  and wrong  oh you mean  because you're  a real person  well  slow down  yeah  it was  I think  that's the  normal  reaction  of just  being  a human  being  that you 
[02:23:30]  would get  from that  I think  a serial  killer  would get  that feeling  that like  that's exhilarating  or something  else  or you get  a rod  or something  yeah  but that  like was  the normal  kind of  alright  that was  bad  let's never  do that  again  that was  a living  thing  like it  was a whole  thing that  happened right  then and there  you know  I had friends  that would  want to put  firecrackers  in frogs  mouths  and blow them  up  and I never  like when I was  around them  I'd always  like ah  just come on  let's go do  something else  it just felt  bad 
[02:24:00]  yeah yeah  why would you  do that  I saw it  a couple times  it was awful  crazy  yeah  so at a  very young  age you  realize  you know  that's kind  of wrong  and this  broad just  kind of  fucking dug  it  and somebody  saying to me  not really  liking the  ultra liberal  gym  I don't  find this  to be  ultra liberal  this is  ultra liberal  because I  think  well that's  again  that's  a nation  of dopes  where you  take somebody  as a liberal  all I've been  doing is  fucking  railing against  the liberal  language policing  but I'm a  liberal  because I don't  want to  fucking shoot 
[02:24:30]  some fucking  some giant  animal and then  sit on it  like I did  something  oh you  that literally  is the equivalent  of me stealing  a joke  and getting a  standing ovation  and smiling  at the camera  it's like  really are you  that empty  oh jesus christ  carlos  this one bugs me  a lot  yeah I see  because it's  fucking  this is the  ultimate bullying  well it really  is bullying  when you  fucking put a  big slug  into an  animal's head  hunting is  my life  I like to 
[02:25:00]  hunt a lot  and I have to  be very careful  not to bite my  tongue again  are you  fucking  deaf  she talks  like a  deaf person  she kind of  does  maybe it's all  that fucking  guns firing  by her ears  she can't hear  anymore  I've damaged  my hearing  and now I  sound like  this because  I'm just  trying to  keep the  levels  let's hear a  little more  of her  she's there  in her  little  graduation  gown  TV broadcasting  in Spanish  I sent out  over 70  resume reels  hoping to  land a great  job in the  TV industry  but everyone  responded with 
[02:25:30]  the same line  you need more  experience  coming straight  out of college  it's really  hard to hear  when you've  been active  kept good  grades  and now  everyone wants  something you  don't have  a penis  and I decided  there was only  one way to get  experience  and that was  to work for  free  I thought  long and hard  and decided  to get  to the North  American  hunting club  they held  a position  for my  dream job  a producer  for hunting  shows  and possibly  a chance  to one day  be on camera  I knew you 
[02:26:00]  couldn't walk  into a place  and request  to be on camera  it's really  inspirational  to hear her  rags to riches  story  about how  I didn't know  what I wanted  to do  and I just  wanted to matter  and this is  what you landed  on  I love to hunt  and my daddy  let me pull  a dead gopher  out of a  fucking hole  which was a  legitimate kill  if you're  stopping it  from fucking  up your trees  but just  what a fucking  valueless  empty existence  well she  wants to make  it her passion  part of her life  I wanted to be  on TV  so I did it  for free  I want to be 
[02:26:30]  on TV  talk like you  just burned  your mouth  with soup  yeah  when Marley  Maitland  comes up  with her  own  channel  you can  be honest  I put in  the door  as an editor  and producer  and maybe  if the opportunity  came up  I could start  hosting  which was my  ultimate goal  after a four month  internship  I was hired on  as a full time  producer  with one of the  best teams  in the hunting  industry  not only did I  learn a ton  about producing  TV from the guys  I worked with 
[02:27:00]  but I was able  to travel the world  and kill things  sure I wasn't  the one squeezing  the trigger  but I was enjoying  every minute of it  I guess you can  compare me to  a big sponge  because I realized  how lucky I was  to hunt with  all these  unbelievable birds  and see how  they did things  of course everyone  has a different  hunting style  but regardless  of who I was  filming  I always learned  something  and that really  helped  look at it  by the way  her and this other  fucking jerk  off with a mustache  just sitting on  some dead bear  how do you 
[02:27:30]  look at that  and feel good  about yourself  ouch that hurts  all I want to see  is one of these  fucking beautiful  animals  mauling these  people to death  mauling them  to death  would you love  that on video  and just watch it  I would laugh  through the whole  thing  I would laugh  and do this  through the whole  thing  yeah  and people on  Twitter are so  fucking stupid  no they're not  do you eat meat  I can't wish  I was here  with a Twitter voice 
[02:28:00]  it's because  I'm not talking  about people  if you eat  what you hunt  and I know  it's a little  hypocritical  I wish I didn't  eat meat  but I do love  a good turkey  I do love them  and they look  silly  and there's plenty  of them  who cares  dumb turkeys  but I don't  sit on the turkey  before I eat it  and pose for a photo  you could  I just eat  and I take my shit  I don't take  a frozen butter ball  and put it on  the fucking kitchen floor  why do you do that  you fucking  empty content  that would be hilarious  why don't you take  a fucking 
[02:28:30]  take a frozen chicken  and stand on it  like you did something  that's what a hunter is  fucking shitheads  so you can keep hunting  I'm not saying  she shouldn't be allowed  to go and do that  but I'm just saying  that I hope she's killed  by an animal  she's hunting  I hope it kills her  let's hear a little more  of her  she's kind of interesting  after a lot of hard work  and dedication  to the job  I was awarded  by a chance  to be on camera  to do  awarded or rewarded  by a chance  I couldn't have been happy 
[02:29:00]  I was also spending  every break you make  that I wasn't working  out hunting on my own  asking anyone willing  to film me  to come along  attention whore  I was able to take  a 202 inch white tail  with my bow  on camera  after a pack of coyotes  chased him right to me  wow  hold on a second  that's amazing  do you mean the coyotes  were hunting to eat  and they chased him  right into the arms  of some cunt  trying to get on camera  wow 
[02:29:30]  what an inspirational story  they were being chased  in their natural habitat  by their natural  by an animal  a natural predator  and I  with my dumb tits  and my camouflage  I'm being videotaped  by a guy  who probably wanted  to fuck me  and just tolerated  my speech impediment  right into my arms  and I was able  to shoot him  with my weapon  and pose with him  it was a 202 inch buck  yeah  it's like someone's  house on fire  and the family's  running out  and she's just 
[02:30:00]  waiting in a tree  to pick them off  that came right at me  yeah  why don't you run  into a burning building  and grab some furniture  look what I got  fucking vulture  you fucking vulture  let's see how this  ended up  she got the deer  well  as I was able  to take a 202 inch  whitetail  with my bow  on camera  after a pack of coyotes  chased him  right to me  some may call it luck  but I'm gonna go ahead  and throw this one  to dedication  but the fact  that he was over 
[02:30:30]  200 inches  was pretty  oh my god  look what else I did  somebody happened  to be filming me  and a deer  had been hit  by a car  so I walked over  with my balding head  and my speech impediment  and I struck it  with a baseball bat  a baseball bat  now some people  would say like  hey you shallow whore  he was already  laying there dying  but I chalked it up  to dedication  and the fact  that there was a guy  who wanted to fuck me  holding a video camera  watching me  and listening to me  talk and pretending  not to be annoyed  by me sounding like  I have hot soup  in my mouth  how do you feel 
[02:31:00]  good about that  the coyotes  chased it to you  and you picked it off  some call it luck  but she calls it  dedication  what about the other  ones of us  that chalk it up  to the fact  that you're a twat  and the guy  videotaping you  just wants to  stick his dick in you  you think that  the guy videotaping  wants a banger  how could he not  watching her with a field  and a coyote  chases it  and he tells her  that was a great job  I got him with my ball  shot him with my ball  I was driving down I-95  and this little baby deer 
[02:31:30]  jumped out  and my car struck it  and thank god  we were videotaping  with a GoPro  now a lot of people  would say  hey cunt  a lot of people  hit deer with their cars  it doesn't mean anything  but I chalk it up  to the fact  that I'm a gifted hunter  fuck her  alright  let's see what happens  I think there's a bear  coming up  oh I hope so  I would love to hear this  it's jammed  oh no  I think you hear the swipe  and then it runs away  and she's like  oh god  he took one of my tits  he took one of my tits 
[02:32:00]  the beautiful animal  I was going to kill  took one of my tits  and ran away  and then the bear  is showing this big  dumb fake tit  if it's a fake tit  to somebody  going you know  a lot of people say  that her gun misfired  but I chalk it up  to dedication  dedication on the bear's part  yeah because imagine  how mad the bear would be  when it's a fake tit  because he thinks  he's got some real meat  and then he takes it  back to his cave  and he's like  what the fuck is this  and then he comes back  and eats her  he realizes he's eating  a water balloon  and the fucking bear cubs  are like  hey dummy  you brought back 
[02:32:30]  a fake tit  there's a nip  a balloon  with a nipple on him  what are we going  to do with this  yeah I know  the guy comes back  to his wife  he's like  honey I got you  some food  and it's a fake tit  she starts screaming  at him  he's like  alright fuck it  I'll go back out  I'll go back out  that'll be the equivalent  of a hunter  shooting a fake reindeer  on the lawn  at Christmas  and bringing it home  brings it home  honey I got dinner  dummy  over 200 inches  look pretty sweet  and I felt like  a very lucky person  to have been able  to take him 
[02:33:00]  capturing this footage  on my own time  sort of helped  open the door  to more hosting  I proved not only  was I a qualified hunter  but I had the drive  and determination  to get it done  at this point in time  I was on the road  close to 100 days  a year for work  so most people  would have probably  enjoyed sitting back  relaxing on their day  not her  not me  I'd get right back  out to a tree stand  every spare second  I had  and if that doesn't  show dedication  I don't know  what does 
[02:33:30]  she's a little weird  she sounds slow  she's an empty  non-contributing  zero  if this is her life  this is what makes  her feel good  but just to show you  how fucking  what a cheese dick  she is  a wild animal  looking for food  chased an animal  into her path  and she killed it  and she feels good  about it  and she says  it wasn't luck  it was determination  and hard work  and dedication  the fact that I was  willing to stand out there 
[02:34:00]  like a valueless idiot  look at the way  the camera cuts off  her bald head  it's fucking great  hey Ed Harris  with tits  why don't you fucking  do something else  in your life  and all the people  out there  I know there's  a lot of hunters  and if you don't know  the difference between  me talking about you  and me talking about her  too bad  and there's a guy  that's like  boycott Jim Norton  I don't care  don't come to my show  if you don't like  what I'm saying  stop following me  on Twitter  don't be a fan  I don't give a fuck  for real  I don't care  if this will turn you off 
[02:34:30]  my opinion on this  don't be a fan  I want to see where  this is all coming to  she's a  well that's like  waiting outside  someone's house  and go  they're going to be hungry  they're going to have to go  to a supermarket  eventually  and then three days later  the guy's like  yeah I gotta go get  a loaf of bread  and he gets fucking  shot dead  we'll bag it  yeah yeah  it wasn't luck  no  the guy was hungry  eventually had to come out  I waited by that house  yeah  alright she's uh  a lot of physical  and mental work  you're carrying  an extremely heavy 
[02:35:00]  backpack  tripod  and usually  oh my god  keep up at all times  oh I didn't realize  so much effort  went into it  you gotta carry  a tripod  and a camera  and big tits  and a backpack  yeah  oh my god  maybe you should have  got eight cups in there  you wouldn't be  so fucking heavy  you'd knock off  nine pounds  oh look at that  jive to carry  a tripod  why don't you just  do it for the love of it  instead of being  an attention whore  yeah  what's the tripod  for you  insincere hole  that's what that's about 
[02:35:30]  just getting some  attention for yourself  nice steady shot  of her uh  hunting  that's the important part  yeah  ugh  ugh  I'm sure Ted Nugent  loves her  how old by the way  and I don't know  this at all  how old is the  Courtney love story  with him  is that old news  maybe it is  I just saw it  retweeted recently  yeah it's old news  she claimed to suck  his dick when she was  12  what ever happened  with that  wow  nothing  did he respond to that  or is that just a lie  she made up  uh  I don't know if he  responded to it or not  I would hope he would  I would hope if a celebrity  accuses you of molesting 
[02:36:00]  them with your cock  in their mouth  that you respond  maybe he did  a lot of guys did that  in the 70s  to be fair  what  you know  got blown after  shows by  yeah but yeah  the Zeppelin guys  don't tell  this guy Roy Harper  supposedly a musician  that Zeppelin took  a lot of stuff from  is supposedly up on  chart from something  from the 70s  the girl was like 12  just came up now  so  I don't know  for some reason  they did that stuff  back in the day  didn't think it was  a problem  again I don't know  if it's true  maybe a total lie 
[02:36:30]  but if you were  a rock star  or anybody  and you let a 12  year old suck your dick  maybe the next time  you're out hunting a deer  you should put the gun  in your own mouth  and blow your fucking  brains out  maybe you should  but again  it may just be a lie  so what if she looks 16  I mean she said that  I'm saying 10 years ago  if knowingly  she said it 10 years ago  maybe there was nothing to it  I don't know if he ever  responded though  if you don't know  you don't know  that's different  I'm talking about if you know  you know what I mean  if you're aware of it  if you don't know  you don't know  the guy from Blood, Sweat and Tears  I think he got in trouble 
[02:37:00]  for that too  whatever his name was  Gary Glitter  famous  well Gary Glitter  Blood, Sweat, Tears  yeah  we know it's a great  great very appropriate title  I don't know how he got that title  the original fucking name of the band  was Bleeding Asshole  and Muffled Screams  but they're like  can you soften this  we can't put it on the album cover  yeah  what do we call the band  I don't know  what's on the sheets  fingernails and cum 
[02:37:30]  no the other side  any more?  tripod  and usually a big camera  you need to keep up  at all times  or you can miss something  and to add to the difficulty  you need to be filming  the entire time  and producing the show  in your head  and let's face it  not every animal  is interested in cooperating  with the camera  and giving you great footage  yeah they're trying not  to get shot footage  call the hunter off  undeniably 
[02:38:00]  it's a difficult job  but it also makes me  a more well-rounded person  and hopefully better on camera  because I understand  listen to her talking  every part  listen to this fucking  listen to this  shallow  it makes her a well-rounded person  and better on camera  you fucking square-headed hole  it's all about her  on camera  and getting that right shot  sometimes the animal  doesn't want to cooperate  and you know  he gets away from that bullet  an animal doesn't want to take two 
[02:38:30]  can we do that over again  yeah  we didn't get that shot  wait wait  we need a close-up here  we got the long shot  we need some coverage  wait we got to light this scene first  can you just hang out  in your trailer for a little bit  yeah then we got to  blow your brains out  and sometimes what I'll do  to attract the animal  that's just foraging  for food for its cubs  is when I'm on my period  I'll open my dumb legs  in the woods  and the smell of blood  will attract the animal  and then we drop an anvil  on his head  like a Bugs Bunny cartoon 
[02:39:00]  oh Jesus  alright  oh  after four years  of working as a full-time producer  for North American Hunter  I decided to part ways  and start my own company  I now do everything  from being on camera all fall  to both post and field production  to managing social media  managing  I absolutely love it  there are very few days off  but that's okay  well that's the way  we like it here 
[02:39:30]  in fact last fall  I decided to take  my family hunting  with me in Illinois  and I decided  well since I've got  all the gear  I'll try filming myself  and boy am I glad  how many times  did she say camera  or filming  filming  myself  a lot of hard work  yes yes  do you understand  what a fucking vapid  shallow nothing  this person is  cameras  I'm in fucking  show business allegedly  and I haven't said  camera this much  in my career  with good reason  I love how 
[02:40:00]  fucking pissed Jimmy is  but she's a fucking  vapid empty nothing  yes  and then hunters  are just rushing  to defend her  I will hunt her too  what do you eat turkey  Jesus how  do people not  hear the difference  people are  this is her whole thing  camera me  me  camera camera me  me  camera camera me  me  hard work  hard work  hard work  yes  hard work  lucky right place  right time  me  camera producer me  dedication  because nobody else  works hard  all you have to do 
[02:40:30]  is lug that equipment  in the middle of the woods  and set it up  and wait  that's not that  fucking hard  coyotes coming  fucking  it's really not that  hard  you set the tripod up  you go hang in a tree  and wait for a fucking  animal to come out  that's not hard  I think this is the part  where she set up  the camera  to film herself  hunting  and she's glad  she did  and now I want to see  why  what happened  it's produced  giant bucks  you're not always  going to see  the number of deer  you'll see on other places  but when you see bucks 
[02:41:00]  usually  they're a whopper  once three o'clock  or so came  deer started  coming onto the field  in fact  I had several does  come out in bed  right in the middle of the footfall  talk about a perfect decoy setup  and then  I saw a buck  coming through the back  just like the bigger bucks do  they don't always walk  right out  that voice is annoying  to listen to  or just see what's going on  they'll usually stay in cover  without exposing themselves 
[02:41:30]  quick blast it  and that's exactly  what this guy did  he was just inching  along the sides  watching the deer  get your gun  I looked at him  and he was nice  very nice  big rack  but no  that's what you are  exactly  why can't we go out  and shoot her  nice with a big rack  if you're a hot chick  and you spend this much time  hunting  you got a lot of problems  that means men  don't want to be around you 
[02:42:00]  right  hot chicks like that  are usually in a bar  they're out clubbing  they're out fucking drinking  having a good time  they're shopping  they're doing all these other  this girl's got a lot of  fucking problems  she likes being out there  killing uh  she does  there's no reason  a hot chick shouldn't be  in the woods  no  like that  nope  you're right  there's something going on  yeah  she should be doing  girly stuff  I think she's a little mental  she definitely  there's something going on there  that voice  she can't fucking speak  alright  what happens to this poor buck  really was nice 
[02:42:30]  very nice  big rack  but no brows  now this wasn't quite the buck  I was looking for  but it definitely  why  what was wrong with it  it didn't have no brows  what are brows  probably  uh  I think that's the part of the antlers  oh  okay  come down maybe  okay  so this  so this thing isn't kind of as valuable  over your mantle  because what  the little things  the bone coming out of its head  isn't good enough  you fucking  empty  fucking  vapid cunts  holy shit 
[02:43:00]  holy shit  oh my god  how does anybody do this  and feel fucking good about it  like just listen to her explaining it  you don't  no I don't  like her  no I don't  no brows  now this wasn't quite the buck  I was looking for  but it definitely got my spirits up  knowing  that the bucks  were probably on their feet  and I had all the decoys needed  right in my field  I don't know  might be making a big mistake here  but 
[02:43:30]  if I am  I'll go home without a tag  and  guess I don't get any venison this year  I guess not  I can't get over that  speech pattern  when you're hunting in December  the weather can change in an instant  can it  and unluckily for me  it started snowing  raining  just turning into a nasty day  uh oh  now what  now this is a farm  where you're not going to see  a ton of deer  you're going to see a couple  but guess what  I don't have a ton of tags  I've got one  buck pig  and my cutty bag 
[02:44:00]  is sitting up  and it's telling me  there are some giants here  there's one that's  palmated  a drop time  what is she saying  go back a little bit  wait did she  did she fucking just say  stop sign  stop sign  what are you  fucking fake teeth  can we hear that  with her fucking  it sounds like she has dentures  my tags  I've got one  buck pig  and my cutty bag  has been sitting up  and it's telling me  there are some giants here  there's one that's  palmated  a drop time 
[02:44:30]  drop time  the palmated  drop time  ugh  how fucking awful  I bet she gives a nice  sloppy blowjob though  yeah  a little spit  a lot of spit  her fucking  but it sounds like  she has fake teeth  hope her choppers  don't fall out on your balls  see now I see why  she spent so much time  in the woods  she's in a bar  guy comes up  look at that fucking  chick  look at those tits  hi how you doing  hi hi  I'm a hunter  guy's like  I'm getting the fuck out of here  going home and jerking off  yeah fuck that  yeah  don't tell you about 
[02:45:00]  the last  buck I banged  some giants here  there's one that's  palmated  a drop time  another  palmated  a drop time  basically any of those  will do  and that's kind of  what's been giving me  the confidence  to keep passing these bucks  but having a trail camera  I know what's here  it's not that maybe  someone's seen them  oh they think it's a  170  180  190  I've seen the pictures  he's a giant  now I just gotta wait 
[02:45:30]  and that's the tough part  that's the tough part  waiting  as the sun started setting  I looked over  and I saw a buff  right in the field  what  oh boy  oh boy  oh the poor thing  bye bye  she's gonna shoot  great music by the way  you like it  yeah  oh look how majestic 
[02:46:00]  oh boy  the suspense is killing me  oh  all right  she's  she's breathing  I'm just getting  the breathing down  uh oh  and  oh  that was so  cool  cool as opposed to what  your husband fucking you  properly and giving you  an orgasm  you know what would be 
[02:46:30]  really cool  let me correct you  what would be really cool  is if she went and shot  something jammed  and the gun misfired  and blew half of her  fucking dumb face off  you like that yeah  more than I would like  breathing I would like that  if that video ended  with her laying there  going oh my god  oh my god  like fucking  like Charlene Nash  would fucking have her  face missing  because the gun  blew her face off  that would make me happy  looking like the fucking  chicken guy  from Breaking Bad  leaving the hospital  oh god 
[02:47:00]  uh  oh okay  so  so cool  it's almost  almost at the end  of shooting night  any other producer  in the world  would have probably  said  no goat  you're not shooting  but lucky for me  I'm on my own  on this one  how fucking  hateable is this woman  I know  any other producer  I really don't like  this woman  she's fucking hateable  it's not even totally  because of her  her hunting  she's not a likable  person  she's very  yeah  vapid 
[02:47:30]  just bragging about  how great she is  obviously  raised in a very  privileged fucking  bullshit  plenty of money  family  yeah fuck her  I like you  I know her husband's  not fucking her  that was so  awesome  the gun stayed  hard  like I opened my  mouth and the gun  didn't just go limp  fuck you  luck  I'm really enjoying 
[02:48:00]  blocking people today  oh yeah I bet  yes  and you can disagree  with me  one guy said  I love you  but I don't agree  with you  alright fine  you're not blocked  that's what I don't  understand  like if you're a  passion hunter  the passions I have  are like pro football  and like metal  or something  like let's just  throw them out  if someone goes  metal sucks  it's fucking the worst  it's fucking  stupid lyrics  I'm not gonna go  what the fuck  you're not my friend  anymore  I don't care  I'm like alright  I like it  I don't give a shit  alright if you don't  like it I get it  you don't like pro football  it's fucking boring 
[02:48:30]  there's too many rules  there's a bunch of  pussies now  I get it  I'm not gonna be  mad at you  I like it  sorry  there's a little bit  left I guess  our end of this  video  wow  not only  is this an  absolute  beautiful buck  I filmed the whole  hunt myself  alright hold on  let's pause this  because we have  a phone call  very important  as far as  the weekend goes  with the UFC  thing  Joe Rogan's on  the phone  ladies and gentlemen  Joe Rogan 
[02:49:00]  hi Joe  what's up Joe  hey I got up  specifically  because I read  Anthony Coombe's  tweets  oh my god  I was livid  I bet $25  on that match  and I gotta tell ya  I was playing poker  with some of my  buddies  and the fight  was on  and I decided  to bet $25  it had nothing  to do with the  money  it was the  principle of it  Joe  what the fuck  was that about  well there's 
[02:49:30]  two problems  with the decision  one of them  is terrible  judges  and two  is a really  bad scoring  system  that we  took from  boxing  the 10 point  must  yes  it's a terrible  system  and even  even though  it's a terrible  system  even in the  format that  it's not even  used correctly  like if you  have a round  where it's  debatable who  won and you  give them a  10-9 round  and then you  have a round 
[02:50:00]  like round  two where  Hendricks  rocked GSP  had him badly  hurt  had him really  fucked up  they give that  a 10-9 round  as well  that makes  zero fucking  sense  yeah  hey let me  ask you Joe  which rounds  did you  I mean I  thought  P.O.1  won round  three and he  looked better  in round  five  did you give  him any  rounds  or what  did you  think  he could  have had  those two  rounds  yeah  he and  five  the real  issue is  damage  and the  like what 
[02:50:30]  has been  done to  Johnny  Hendricks  just scoring  like tagging  him or  hurting him  Johnny  Hendricks  clearly hurt  George way  more than  George hurt  him and  this is the  hurt game  it's all  about hurt  right I  don't know  why this  has to be  judged on  the boxing  criteria why  everybody thinks  well it's  this and  the way they  judged it was  because of  the punches  that connected  and stuff  no an  effective part  of this is  how much  you're beating  the shit 
[02:51:00]  out of the  other guy  yeah without  a doubt  and that's  also what  we're talking  about the  issue with  the scoring  system  we just  took the  10-point  must  system  that was  already  approved  by the  Nevada  State  Athletic  Commission  so what  MMA needs  is a much  more comprehensive  system  you're dealing  with kicks  and knees  and elbows  and take  thousand  submission  attempts  so many more  facets of  fighting  than exist  in boxing  that have  to be scored  and then have  to be  subjectively  analyzed  it's a  fucking  mess 
[02:51:30]  yeah  that was  obviously  Dana  was not  happy  with the  result of  that one  he let  it be  known  and let  me ask  it felt  like it was  almost  and this  might sound  paranoid  but it felt  almost like  one of those  judges was very  pro-Canada  because the  Rory McDonald  fight  and I love  Rory McDonald  but I thought  he clearly  lost that  fight  if I remember  he won  round two  but I thought  he pretty  clearly lost  that fight  and it was  still a split  decision  I'm like  how is that  a split  decision  who thought  he won  that fight  well the  Rory fight 
[02:52:00]  was a little  closer  and here's  the issue  the leg kicks  of Robbie Lawler  were big  in the first  round  and then he  landed a head  kick towards  the end  of the round  I thought  he won  that round  but I could  see someone  scoring it  for Rory  I wouldn't  agree with  him  but I could  see it  okay  do you mean  round two  or three  round one  I was saying  for Rory  round two  was  much more  close  right  and at round  three  Robbie won  in a big way 
[02:52:30]  yeah I thought  it was Robbie  Rory  and then Robbie  maybe right  but I was  about round  one  but I was like  how did anybody  see that  as a fucking  it just  the judging  is absolutely  just atrocious  and it's not  all like  and people  who criticize  Dana  it's like  the UFC  financially  it's a big  advantage  if GSP  wins  and then they  can probably  promote a super  fight  if Silva wins  so for him  to go out  there and go  look this  just wasn't  fair  is obviously  he's not  thinking  of the money  he's thinking  of what was  the right  and wrong  decision  credibility  and for the  UFC  first of all 
[02:53:00]  it's terrible  if a fighter  wins  but loses  that's terrible  because that  gets everybody  mad  gets people  who bet  angry  they lost  money  there's a lot  of people  in Vegas  that's dead  on that fight  oh man  they must have  been really  fucking pissed  imagine that  right we  so  look the  Nevada State  Athletic Commission  fucking sucks  they're terrible  they've done  nothing to  change  they have a  real issue  with their  judges  and a lot 
[02:53:30]  of the issue  is these  people have  no martial  arts experience  whatsoever  they're boxing  judges that  they've sort of  trained in MMA  they have the  same issue  with the  referees  you got  referees  there's a  woman named  Kim Winslow  she stood  someone up  while they were  in the middle  of a submission  attempt  you can't  fucking do  that  did you think  you're in a guy's  arm down  for an arm  triangle  now if you  understand  jiu jitsu  you know  what he's  doing  you see it  and you go  oh he's  moving  oh he's 
[02:54:00]  got the arm  and then  she's standing  him up  and I go  Mike what  the fuck  did you think  I thought  that a couple  of times  who was the  Asian referee  what's his  name  Mario  I thought  that he  a couple  of times  made them  stand  where they  were just  kind of  locked up  in the middle  and he  broke it  up  I thought  a couple  of times  he was  a little  bit  invasive  where he  shouldn't  have been  too  you're  absolutely  right  yeah  I didn't  like that  either  I don't  know what  they're  doing  you know  there's  a lot  of the  referees  are standing  people up  and breaking  people apart 
[02:54:30]  when they're  fighting  part of the  fighting is  you're trying  to get a guy  to the ground  it's a struggle  and if it  doesn't work  out  it doesn't  mean that  you gotta  separate them  make them  strike  for the  fucking  meathead  fans  they're  trying to  bring the  fight to  the ground  you gotta  let them  fight  that's  part of  the fight  if you  can watch  a fucking  baseball game  that's not  boring shit  ever  if you can  watch that  you can't  watch  the winch  and mortal  combat  trying to  drag each  other to the  ground  where they  are going to  strangle 
[02:55:00]  each other  people are  so used  to boxing  where if  they're  clinching  there isn't  any action  going on  you can't  use that  with MMA  because  people are  trying  submission  holes  why would  you get  in there  and bust  up the  two guys  that are  trying to  actually  work a  hold  Joe  so what  can the  UFC do  about this  so it  doesn't  happen  again  they can't  do  anything  the UFC  is  all they 
[02:55:30]  are  is  a  promoter  the  athletic  commission  are the  people  that assign  the  referees  they're  the  people  that assign  the judges  they're  the people  that do  everything  so there's  not much  they can  do  Herb Dean  is my  favorite  of all  the  I think  he has  the best  instincts  he comes  in like  he's  going to  stop it  and then  he sees  the guys  okay  I find  him to  be the  best  one  you're  absolutely  right  he's  the best  he's  the best  there's  a bunch  of  real  issues  on  when it  comes to  refereeing  when it 
[02:56:00]  comes to  officiating  fights  judging  fights  there's  a bunch  of  real  fucking  issues  and they  haven't done  anything  about it  and it's  the same  issues  that happened  in boxing  when you  saw  how about  the last  fight  with  Floyd  Mayweather  where one  of those  fucking  judges  didn't score  it  100%  for Mayweather  when he  fucked  Canelo  Averis  that's  corruption  that woman  is the  same  woman  that  scored  Timothy  Bradley  beating  Pacquiao  which was  another  atrocious 
[02:56:30]  decision  that's  corruption  so you've  got  incompetence  and you've  also got  people that  are probably  getting paid  that's a  real problem  because  here's a  position  like the  Floyd Mayweather  fight  it wasn't  a unanimous  decision  it was a  majority  decision  one of the  fucking  judges  that dumb  cunt  scored  in a  draw  so when  you look  at that  you go  what's  the  significance  he still  won  he didn't  win a  unanimous  decision  and the  betting  on 
[02:57:00]  unanimous  decision  was  huge  most  of  Floyd Mayweather's  fights  are won  by unanimous  decision  almost all  of them  the last  time he  stopped  the guy  I believe  was  Ricky  Hatton  that was  the last  fight he  stopped  everyone knows  he has  brittle hands  so he  doesn't  blast  guys  he stopped  that other  kid too  who was  turning away  and he  punched him  so people  don't realize  you could bet  on whether  it's an  unanimous  decision  or not  right  that's where 
[02:57:30]  a gambler  wants a judge  a gambler  with a  fuckload  of money  can come to  a judge  and say  listen  everybody knows  Floyd's gonna  win this fight  but if  one judge  has a draw  you know  it's not gonna  hurt anybody  right  oh man  so  one guy  steps in  and bets  you know  a fucking  million bucks  on a  five to one  shot  that it's a  majority  decision win  because most  people are not  thinking it's  gonna be a  majority  decision win  so she gets 
[02:58:00]  paid  he gets  paid  now she just  vanishes  from boxing  she just  retired  yeah she's  made her money  CJ Ross  I believe her name  was  oh she retired  yeah she said  well I'm gonna  step away for a  little bit  take care  see ya  later  yeah they stink  those judges  mate  yeah that's a  great point  I always thought  the fact that  it's in Vegas  and they're so  close to the  casinos  and so close  to the gamblers  it's gotta be  very difficult  to not allow  that to influence  you as a judge  when you have  so much power  oh no doubt  and you're in 
[02:58:30]  fucking Vegas  the dirtiest place  ever when it  comes to that  it's a place  that was founded  on corruption  yeah yeah  is it only Vegas  that you have  these problems  with  well you know  look  I love Vegas  I don't think  there's anything  wrong with Vegas  I think there's  wrong with people  when it comes to  money and influence  and just being  incompetent  a lot of people  just fucking suck  yeah yeah  and then there's  also the issue  that people get  into power  and they're 
[02:59:00]  essentially politicians  if you  if they revamped  the system  they would have  to admit  that they were  wrong  and then someone  has to come  along and say  well what the fuck  were you guys  doing back  in this fight  and how come  you didn't do  it after that fight  so it becomes  an issue of  admitting  that you fucked  up in the first  place  so you guys  have no  there's no recourse  there's no  nowhere to go  I mean  Dana was talking  about you know  getting the governor  involved  well he's right  because when you're 
[02:59:30]  dealing with  athletic commissions  they're all  people that are  essentially government  workers  they were trying  to get the  government  involved  after the  Manny Pacquiao  decision  after Manny  or the  that one  with Manny Pacquiao  and Timothy Bradley  where everybody  thought that Manny Pacquiao  won  and Timothy Bradley  was a big underdog  but won the fight  a lot of people  thought that was  corruption  and again  that was one  of the same  people  that's well  and CJ Ross  who doesn't  do it anymore  and then  there was  the fight  with  Canelo Alvarez 
[03:00:00]  and Mayweather  where everybody  thought Mayweather  pitched a shutout  and this one  chick  the same one  comes along  and scores  she looks awful  by the way  I hate her  fucking  androgynous  initials  I detest  her fucking  her attempt  to not let  people know  her gender  until she shows up  because she thinks  that's how she'll  avoid bias  CJ  yeah  that's actually  how Jamie Foxx  changed his name  so he could get up  at the Laugh Factory  are you serious  yeah  because his name  isn't Jamie Foxx 
[03:00:30]  Jamie Foxx  is a stage name  that he created  because it sounded  like a girl  oh my god  that's amazing  holy shit  that's amazing  it does  he's actually  kind of genius  it really is  I went the same  direction  but Cunt McGillicuddy  never flew  well that makes  sense dude  but by the way  Bob Kelly tweeted  me  he might have  texted me  that they're going  to do a rematch  in Dallas  which is where  I guess  Johnny is from  is that not true  or is that just  being true  they may do that  here's another issue  that I haven't  talked about before 
[03:01:00]  but I'll talk about  with you guys  I think George  should retire  and one of the  reasons why I think  George should retire  is George was on  my podcast  and he was  which is also  available on the  Opie and Anthony  channel  and he was  talking about  being abducted  by aliens  come on  yeah  and I was  going  you think you  get abducted  by aliens  he was like  there are times  when I'm driving  my car  you know  he starts talking  about like  missing time  like he started  talking about  how he's driving  his car  and all of a sudden 
[03:01:30]  he's at home  and he has no idea  where he got there  I've had that  I've had that happen  it's not  that's for sure  do you think it's  Alzheimer's or something  I think it's head  kicks  from the planet  Jägermeister  that's usually  the problem  well he mentioned  the memory too  in the post game  interview  yeah well that was  that fight  that fight  after  you know  the fight  he had some  serious memory loss  holy fuck  I think he's taken  too many shots  and an interesting 
[03:02:00]  statistic is that  George has taken  more punches  and kicks  in the last  three fights  than any of his  fights ever  in fact  50% of the  shots that he's taken  in his entire  career  were in the last  three fights  yeah  when you're at  that point  you gotta get  the fuck out  or you're just  gonna be a disaster  I know the UFC  probably doesn't  want to hear me  say that  I know that  you know  that could be  a huge rematch  first of all  I think they should  just give  Johnny Hendricks  the belt  I think Johnny 
[03:02:30]  Hendricks won  that fight  I think that  there's real  problems with  judging  and I don't  think that  there should  be a way  that a guy  could win a fight  but yet lose  a fight  I think there's  gotta be a way  they can step  in and figure  out how to  if it's a  unanimous  sort of a  verdict like this  where everyone  across the board  all throughout  almost every expert  there's a few  contrarians out there  of course  it was scored  you know  if you score it  you get scored  for GSP  and I've read  a lot of  really fucking  dumb people  that thought  GSP tapped 
[03:03:00]  in the first round  you mean  Johnny Hendricks  he was moving  his hand  but he did not  tap  he did not  tap  in the first round  people are fucking  ridiculous  didn't it almost  look like  I saw him  move his hand  like that  later in the fight  too  but he was  standing up  and it was  almost like  a judging thing  like  almost like  a stutter step  but he was  doing it with his  hand  it didn't look  like a tap  well he's trying  to figure out  what to do  with his hips  he's trying  to figure out  how to  well  when you've got  a guy on top  of you  and he's  mounting you  and he's trying to  choke you  the options  the options  are twofold  one  you've got to  figure out 
[03:03:30]  how to  push him  off you  and two  you've got to  figure out  how to  separate the  choke  so he's  got to  figure out  what to do  so he's  in the middle  of trying  to decide  how tight  is his choke  and that  depends on  which way  he's twisting  his neck  can he twist  his neck  out of it  can he tuck  his chin  should he put  his hands  on his hips  or should he  grab the choke  and so he  probably had  a moment  of hesitation  yeah  and it looks  like you're  tapping  the only way  you tap  that quick  is if a guy  is ripping  your fucking  neck off  your head  and that 
[03:04:00]  just wasn't  happening  I was impressed  with Johnny  Hendricks  I thought he  was kind of  like fucking  Roy Nelson  where he had  one big punch  but his  with his  left  I'm like  a GSP  is going to  kick the shit  out of him  I was completely  wrong  he's much  much more  rounded than  I gave him  credit for  he's a badass  wrestler  those badass  wrestlers  when you're  dealing with  a guy  who's a  two time  division one  national champion  wrestling is  the grueless  fucking sport  on the planet  and when you're  dealing with a  guy who's  gone through  the ranks 
[03:04:30]  of amateur  wrestling  and gone  to the top  you're dealing  with a guy  who knows  how to compete  he knows  how to win  mentally  they're incredibly  strong  there's a lot  of factors  leading into  that  and then there's  the fact  that he  fucking hits  hard  I didn't like  a lot of  things about  that fight  watching George  fight  I didn't like  that he wasn't  moving his head  and I was  mentioning that  in the fight  like he's not  moving his head  off the center  line  when he was  standing  he was like  moving in  or moving out  and Johnny  was tagging him  over and over  again  he was hitting him  in the clinch  when George 
[03:05:00]  was trying to  take him down  Johnny was  blasting him  with elbows  I think there's  I think there's  a certain amount  of enthusiasm  and passion  that George  that any champion  has to have  and I think  George is starting  to let that slip  because I think  he's concerned  about his health  right right right  as he should be  Jesus Christ  what do you think  about Weidman  Silva too  which is a fight  that I want to go to  I actually booked  Las Vegas  just so I can go  to a fucking fight  that's going to be  amazing  that's going to be  an amazing fight  do you think  that Silva's able 
[03:05:30]  to beat him  or do you think  that Weidman  just has his number  well when a guy  knocks you out  that's a huge  psychological advantage  and when a guy  knocks you out  because you're clowning  you feel like  a fucking idiot  yeah no shit  yeah I mean  that was like  the biggest  oh my god  I feel like  an idiot moment  ever in the UFC  a guy drops his hands  he's taunting a guy  and the guy goes  oh really  pink  and just knocks him  unconscious  I mean it was terrible  doesn't that also  make it like  maybe psychologically  easier for Silva 
[03:06:00]  because he's like  I know what I was  doing was stupid  so that won't happen  again as opposed  to giving it your best  and still getting  knocked out  it's possible  but you know  what here's another  thing Brazilians  are mad at Silva  like apparently  like Brazil was like  you know Anderson Silva  was the darling  of Brazil  but now Anderson  was getting booed  oh wow yeah  Brazil had a fight  and he looked  like an idiot  yeah well people  are like you  you know you made  us look stupid  like they're very  nationalistic  I mean I'm sure  he could get all that  back if he won  yeah yeah  but yeah 
[03:06:30]  and then the other  thing is  Chris Weidman  is a motherfucker  he's a motherfucker  dude  he's a different  kind of guy  he's a strong  dude  very strong  mentally  and he believes  himself 100%  and going into  that fight  he has issues  with his knees  Weidman's had  trouble with his knees  for a long time  but he recently  went and got  this blood spinning  procedure done  in Germany  oh that seems  to be the thing  to do  I just got it  done  yeah  I just got it  done on my neck  it's fucking  amazing 
[03:07:00]  what did it do  for you  I had a bulging  disc in my neck  that's been bothering  me for years  from jujitsu  from just getting  my neck cranked  and I was getting  numbness in my hands  at one point in time  so I stopped  I got real proactive  with it  did a lot of  different therapies  spinal decompression  all these different  injections  like prolo ozone  where they're trying  to promote  healing in the area  but nothing  worked like this  shit  this shit  they take your  blood out  and then they  they take out  like a liter  of blood 
[03:07:30]  it's a fucking  Evian bottle  blood  it's huge  I put pictures  of it on my  Instagram  how much blood  they take out  it actually gave  me the flu  because I was  kind of sick  going in  I had a little  bit of sniffles  and they took  all this blood  out  my body  just went  yeah  we need that  we need that  stuff  Joe  stupid  yeah  damn  so wait  they take  your blood  they spit  out  and they  they spin  it in a  centrifuge  and apply  heat to it  and apparently  it makes your  blood produce 
[03:08:00]  all sorts of  different factors  for healing  and it  it becomes  the most  effective  anti-inflammatory  drug known  to man  wow  yeah  and it's  produced for  your own  blood  it's not  FDA approved  in America  so like  if you get it  done in America  which I did  you have to  do what's  called off  label  which means  your insurance  doesn't cover it  and it's expensive  it's like 12  grand  but in Germany  they're just  much more  advanced 
[03:08:30]  because they  didn't have to  deal with all  the stem  shell bullshit  of the Bush  administration  so they  can do all  these different  types of  procedures  and they get  actual  insurance  and research  so with  this blood  spinning  they spin  it around  they heat  it up  and then they  take out  this yellow  serum  and then they  inject it  directly into  joints  to me  it was in  my back  Dana White  had it done  they did it  intramuscularly  with him  because he has  Meniere's disease  or something  in his ears  is it still  helping him  fuck yeah 
[03:09:00]  it's incredible  this stuff  is like  it reduces  inflammation  like almost  instantly  within two days  after the injections  I was like  holy shit  I got a new  neck  it's like  for years  my neck  was always  stiff  I'd have to  get deep  tissue massages  a couple times  a week  just to be  able to do  things  Joe  in baseball  and sports  and stuff  like that  they're totally  against this  they think  there's HGH  involved  I know  because  Bartolo Cologne  the pitcher for the A's  went over to Germany  and got this done 
[03:09:30]  and all of a sudden  he started pitching  great  they were researching  they won  medical records  what went on  why you healed  why can you throw  a fastball  92 miles an hour  42 years old  yeah  but it's just  healing  that's all it is  if they're against  healing  they're assholes  this isn't anything  that's  there's no like  steroids  or superhuman effects  or anything  where it's making  you grow extra muscle  or thicken your tendons  which other things  already you can do  that are legal  one of the things  that I had done 
[03:10:00]  was called  prolo ozone therapy  and prolo therapy  has been done  for years  and a lot of grapplers  do it actually  just to strengthen  their tendons  when they don't  even have injuries  what it is  is they inject  this glucose solution  directly into your tendons  and it makes them  thicken and strengthen  as much as 40%  that sounds fucked up  yeah I've had a dot  on my knees  I've had a dot on my wrist  I've had a dot on my back  it's painful as fuck  but it's very legitimate  it really does have  a substantial benefit  and the tendon strength 
[03:10:30]  is a permanent improvement  so people are doing that  legally  I mean you're strengthening  your tendons  by 40 fucking percent  legally  why doesn't sports  like baseball and football  to get these big stars  back on the field quicker  you know get into this  well they are doing it  Peyton Manning did it  that's how he's playing football  oh right  did he go over to Germany  to get this done  what's that  did he go over to Germany  to get that  yeah yeah  he was ready to retire  he had two fucking neck surgeries  he was ready to pack it  he had the exact same injury  that I had  what's the big aversion  here in the United States 
[03:11:00]  for making this mainstream  well I'm sure  there's a lot of different pressures  there's orthopedic surgeons  that don't like it  because it's going to  fucking kill their business  people that are doing  hip surgeries  there's people that  they're sawing the top  of people's hips off  yeah  they saw your fucking steamer off  replace it with this  mechanical joint  that's not necessary  if you go and get this  Regenokine  in a lot of circumstances  wow  Regenokine  and Regenokine  Regenokine  but you can read about it online 
[03:11:30]  they explain  all the different  things that it does  Joe you ever see  you ever see  when they saw the top  of the femur off  and then they  fucking mallet  hammer that metal  fucking ball in there  oh  it's crazy looking  it's horrific  I had a friend  who had it done  recently  really  it's amazing  six weeks late  actually another friend  Mark Coleman  the former UFC  heavyweight champion  he had it done  really  his hips were shot  all those years  of grueling  wrestling practice 
[03:12:00]  rips your cartilage apart  gives you arthritis  in your knees  it's  yeah  it's pretty  it's pretty amazing  I mean  if there's another way  to do it  obviously  that would be  the better way  but it is amazing  that they figured out  how to fucking  put a metal  goddamn ball joint  on your leg  and shove it back  into the fucking socket  it is amazing  and if it was  the best option  right  but obviously  the best option  is getting your body  to heal quicker  because once they do that 
[03:12:30]  once they saw that thing off  that's it man  you don't have that anymore  so you don't have to deal  with that forever  if it goes  those things are only good  for like 10-15 years  I think too  or maybe 25  whatever it is  but it's  a finite amount of time  those mechanical joints  are good for  you're going to have to  replace it with a new one  there's always this  image that  that surgery  is always very delicate  and you see the doctor  with the scalpel  doing this very delicate maneuver  and then you watch  these shows  they're literally 
[03:13:00]  taking a hammer  and chisel  and fucking like  banging at the guy's hips  and using a sawzall  like a fucking carpenter  notching a header  it's unbelievably hard to watch  yeah it's terrifying shit man  there's doctors  there's a lot of them  that specialize in that  and they're ready  to look  for me  I went to a doctor  and he was like  hey you know  you're going to need  to get surgery  we're going to have to  cut you open  we're going to have to  chop a piece of your disc out  and the other option 
[03:13:30]  is we can replace it  with an artificial disc  like they were saying  that it's just a matter of time  that I had to get surgery  you're going to deal with this  no matter what  you've got to get surgery  this Regenacine  shit  boom  done  6mm bulge in my neck  gone  vanished  how big is 6mm  how many inches  is that 6mm  it's about the size of your cock  length or girth  I don't know  it's not that big  half inch  6mm  yeah it's about a half an inch  oh wow  not even a half an inch  I don't think  it's significant enough 
[03:14:00]  it was numbing my hands  it was pressing against the nerves  wow  now is there anything else  that's good for  besides inflammation  it actually seems like  there's got to be  a bunch of other stuff  that you can do  with the blood  if it's spun like that  would that help  with any other ailments  well inflammation  is the big one  but what's going on  is that they're figuring out  a bunch of different ways  to use your body's  own tissue  to heal itself  there's stem cell procedures  that are being done now  and they're going to figure out  within 2 years  the same guy  Dr. Peter Welling 
[03:14:30]  in Germany  they're figuring out a way  to restart your body's  production of collagen  which is the reason  why people get wrinkles  in the first place  wow  so all these people  that have like  you know  have plastic surgery  and have their necks  pulled back  to hide their wrinkles  they're not going to be  necessary anymore  they're going to give you a shot  and your body's going to  kick start  your production of collagen  and you're going to look like  you're fucking 25 again  but will it go  but will it be able  to go retroactive  because I'm hanging in there  at 45  but I'm starting  fantastic Jimmy  oh Joe  from your lips 
[03:15:00]  to God's ears  but I'm starting  to look kind of  like a fucking bag of shit  so I'm like  well wait  until you'll be 47  I'll be out  in some years  yeah but they won't  give me the first shot  of treatment  so I'm thinking 50  then I'll have to fly over  to Germany  and fucking have a nice  new face put on  and then maybe hire  someone to shit on it  yes exactly  nice shit video  well there's probably  you know  there's probably going to be  some shit in the future  that's going to change us  from the ground up  I mean  what we're dealing with  is the steps 
[03:15:30]  the baby steps  of this new technology  when it comes to  the healing of the body  new understanding  of the healing of the body  that they're just getting into now  yeah everything else  seemed to  up till now  medically  to be very intrusive  on the body  instead of working with it  and if you could get  on the genetic level  to get the body  to you know  reboot  like you said  like a fucking computer  you know  just reboot the body  and have it start making stuff  that it made  before anyway  like why the hell  did it stop  you know 
[03:16:00]  if they could figure that out  instead of going in  and hacking things out  and being more  intrusive  I think it'd be great  yeah they're  they're gonna figure out  a way to genetically  alter the human body  and change it  not just  in terms of healing  but they're gonna be able  to design people  within a hundred  two hundred years  you're not gonna have  any ugly people left  oh man  Hitler was born  way too early  he could have  really appreciated  this type of technology  true  I mean everything 
[03:16:30]  that he wanted to do  created the Aryan race  right  perfect super race  but it's not even  going to be that  think about these freaks  that are like furries  that want to be  giant mascots  yeah  they're gonna be  real mascots  like they're gonna be able  to do that  they're gonna be able  to give you a dick  like a carpet roll  they're gonna be able  to give you wings  they're gonna be able  to genetically  manipulate the human body  fucking x-men shit  yeah  100%  that's crazy  they're gonna be able  to ready for this  they're combining  spider silk  and human tissue 
[03:17:00]  to make artificial skin  that's fucking bulletproof  okay that's crazy  they're gonna be able  to grow bulletproof skin  wow now just think of  the implications there  yeah  there's gonna be  some amazing shit  for bad people  all I want Joe  I don't need all that  nonsense  I just want to be able  to tap dance  like Gregory Hines  that's why I want science  to teach me  how to tap dance  we're gonna have  some really interesting  times in the next  100, 200 years 
[03:17:30]  and what  you know  a lot of people  like  the transcendent man  Ray Carswell  Ray Carswell  he believes  that if you can live  to be 50 more years  you're gonna be able  to live to be a thousand  he believes  that we're literally  on the cusp  and that within  the next 50 years  the technologies  that they're working  on right now  for life extension  are gonna kick  into the point  where they're gonna  be able to  things like this  where they're healing  your body  using your body's  own tissue  using your body's 
[03:18:00]  own blood zone  this is just  the baby steps  this is essentially  like creating  the transistor  that's gonna lead  to the iPhone  you know  in 100 years  right  and then it's just  exponentially  you'll be living longer  just like they have  with computer memory  and things like that  they're not just  living longer  they're gonna be able  to alter the human body  and change its form  into anything they want  when you're getting  to a point  where they're able  to 3D print guns  which is what  they're doing now  where essentially  you get the raw materials  you throw them  into this machine 
[03:18:30]  then you get the design  you print it out  you got that  Jeff Dunham in there  that we remember  yeah  with his printer  with his dummy heads  yeah  fascinating fascinating stuff  but they're using  that now  to print out  organs  they're using that now  to print out  body parts  they're gonna be able  to make guns  and then they're gonna  eventually  be able to do that  with tissue  they're gonna be able  to do that  with body parts  they're gonna be able  to make you  a new fucking arm  and a machine  and then they're gonna  be able to do that  with the human body  as far as changing  the shape  we're gonna have 
[03:19:00]  giants  we're gonna have  10 foot tall people  I love talking to  this wacky world  that we're gonna  fucking have to live in  do you think  Ray Kurzweil's  time frame is off  I feel it's partial  wishful thinking  that he thinks  what did he say  by 2035  45  I think he's off  yeah he might be off  but the thing about  Ray Kurzweil  he's been right  about everything  he predicted  search engines  when the internet  first started  he predicted  the internet itself 
[03:19:30]  he predicted  voice to text  speech  and helped create it  he predicted  a million different things  he's a super genius  so when a guy like that  sees the potential  based on  what's currently available  what's possible  and what's being worked on  he's not just  like speculating idly  he's making calculations  based on what  has already been achieved  his vitamin  what's his vitamin regimen  do you have to  belong to something  to get that  or join  Flintstone chewables  oh I thought it was  simple  yeah he likes 
[03:20:00]  Flintstone chewables  and the little gummies  the gummies  the gummy bears  I give those to my kids  they're awesome  he wrote a book on it  I don't know  his exact protocol  but he discussed  when I interviewed him  for my sci-fi show  when we were talking  about life extension  and he went into depth  about it  about all the different  supplements  and amino acids  that he takes  on a daily basis  he essentially takes  about 100 pills  now do you think  that's crazy  knowing about  the health that you know  well no  no it's definitely  not crazy 
[03:20:30]  but without a doubt  nutrition has a  really big impact  on the way  your body functions  the nutrition  is essentially  the building blocks  for cells  the building blocks  for repairing your body  it's definitely  onto something  if there's certain things  like nootropics  which are nutrients  that are designed  to enhance cognitive function  my company Onnit  I own a piece of  Onnit.com  it's O-N-N-I-T  it's all about  we sell  it's a human optimization website  we sell 
[03:21:00]  different supplements  that are designed  to enhance  the way your body works  one of them is  a nutrient rich supplement  called AlphaBrain  which is based  on this science  the science of  creating these  different supplements  that enhance  your brain's ability  to produce neurotransmitters  I hate when you  and then you talk  whenever I hear  something like this  that sounds so great  there's always one  person that will write  and go  don't take it  it gives you cancer  on the heel  there's always one  fucking naysayer  there's always naysayers 
[03:21:30]  but you don't  really have to worry  too much about  things that are  food based  as long as  there's a long  history of people  using them  and that's  what this stuff is  if you want to worry  about cancer  cancer is  a lot of what cancer  is is inflammation  and inflammation  which is what  this guy Peter Welling  is curing  with this  Regenochine  treatment  and also  free radicals  and there's also  a genetic aspect  to cancer  there's an environmental  aspect to cancer  guys people are living  in New York City  and living in Los Angeles  there's a study 
[03:22:00]  recently that said  that that's taking  a certain amount  of years off your life  no matter what  just where you live  yeah  living in a place  where there's a lot  of pollution  you're taking  no doubt about it  you're taking years  off your life  there's nothing  to do about it  when you realize  when you're walking  down the street  here in New York City  and there's that  many cars  just the brake  lining dust  alone  that's  like all that  asbestos  that's flying  into your face  from just the  brake linings 
[03:22:30]  terrible  is so bad  get me the fuck  out of here  or another planet  you know when you drive  like anywhere you go  my family used to live  in Pennsylvania  and I used to go  to visit them  they used to live  in like bumfuck  Pennsylvania  like Harrisburg  and I would drive  to visit them  through like these  areas where they  had these cow factories  and you know  there were just  like thousands  of cows  and it stunk  so fucking bad  yeah yeah  but when you're  breathing in  you're breathing in 
[03:23:00]  methane  yeah yeah  the whole  the whole fucking  town would stink  yeah that's methane  yeah  you're breathing it in  100%  you're breathing in  something that causes  global warming  that's gotta be healthy  cows produce more  global warming  in India  than cars do  yeah yeah  there's a lot of  natural  um  natural reasons  for uh  global warming  as they say  but I still don't  buy the whole thing  you don't buy global warming  well no I don't  I don't buy it  in that  it's as dangerous 
[03:23:30]  as everybody says  we're humans  of course  we're affecting  the environment  and the planet  you'd be silly  to think  we're not  but I don't know  how bad a thing  that is  when you think about  um  you know  on a global scale  like who cares  well it's pretty fucking bad  when it's gonna raise  the ocean levels  and Miami's gonna disappear  yeah and then you know  there's certain places  where we fucked up  and we built  where we shouldn't have built  that's the bottom line  yeah but then you know  we're not transient enough  when it comes to moving cities  but the great thing is 
[03:24:00]  it just fucks up the people  like when people say  it fucks the planet  it's like  nah  cause once  you know  if the earth decided  to turn around  and fucking  tell people  to go fuck themselves  this planet would be  just dandy  in no time again  that's right  you know  regenerating everything  that we fucked up  if the ocean raised  and killed a bunch of people  that would stop us  from polluting the fucking ocean  and give the ocean  a little bit of a break  yeah and then you know  like who really cares  if a fucking town  gets destroyed  or a city gets fucking  plowed over with water 
[03:24:30]  for a few centuries  no one seems to care  I'm on team people  yeah  that is a great part  of what makes Joe Rogan  he is team people  where do you live Joe  you're not in LA anymore  yeah I am  I'm north of LA  I moved back  when my wife was pregnant  when we lived in Colorado  we were way too high  we were at 8500 feet  it was real bad  so I wound up moving back  but I fucking don't like it here  why is it bad to be pregnant  and be that high up 
[03:25:00]  is that bad for the  really low  the high altitude  is low oxygen  it's really hard to breathe  like it's amazing  when you're working out up there  you know you feel like  you're you're like  like you have a wet blanket  stuffed in your mouth  you can't fucking breathe  it's incredible  how much difference it is  when you're up there  and when I was living up there  I would live up there  for a couple months  then I went to like  sea level  I remember I worked out  in Philadelphia  after I was living up there  you feel like a fucking  superhuman  your body's used to this 
[03:25:30]  high altitude  low oxygen environment  but for women  when they're pregnant  it's very bad  and it's very dangerous  for the baby  there's a lot of  premature births in Colorado  a lot of kids are born  kind of fucked up  it's real dangerous  yeah I guess you want  as much oxygen as possible  yeah  especially if you're not accustomed to it  it takes like three years  for your body  to totally acclimate  oh wow  and you're supposed to be there  all the time  in order for it to acclimate  like if you're up there  and then you spend a month  in Hawaii 
[03:26:00]  you're back to square one  yeah there's a football player  on the Steelers  I think it's Ryan Clark  who can't play in Denver  because he has some kind of condition  where the altitude there  he might die  is he scared of heights  that's very silly Jim  well there's a lot of fights  that we put on there  that are fucking terrible fights  because when we go to Denver  like especially heavyweights  they just can't fucking fight  yeah  we had Mark Hunt  versus Ben Rothwell  and you would think  the guys were incredibly  out of shape  but they're not 
[03:26:30]  they're just too fucking big  to be up there  just lumbering  I remember going to Colorado  for some fucking shot  I don't even know what it was  but I know I was there  and it was a jacuzzi  outside jacuzzi thing  and it was winter  so it was fucking snow  and it was great  but I went inside the condo  and I usually take  two stairs at a time  up the stairs  and I did that  and I was exhausted  like I was huffing and puffing  like I was completely exhausted  someone's just living life  to the fullest  two steps 
[03:27:00]  that's the name of Anthony's autobiography  two steps at a time  two steps at a time  it was terrible though  it's a big impact  but it has a huge effect  for fighters  a lot of fighters  train at altitude  like in Albuquerque  Greg Jackson's camp  trains at altitude  team elevation in Denver  there's a lot of  Amal Easton's place  in Boulder  is famous for guys  going and doing  their training camps there  because it's  at a high altitude  you're working harder  your body develops  more red blood cells  and then you go down  to sea level 
[03:27:30]  and you can perform  a lot of fighters  train at Big Bear as well  in California  for the same reason  how long does that  effect last for  like that super effect  not long  that's the thing  you gotta get it in  within a week or two  you gotta be back  you know  like if you have  a training camp  you're supposed to  stay up there  until as close  to the fight  as you can get  any of this blood  stuff you're talking  about  of these pills  I've always had  bad sinuses  I've gotten the  surgery  I've had my  adenoids shrunk  with a needle 
[03:28:00]  twice since  and I still get  the congestion  and the fucking  allergies  which you can't  do anything about  did you ever  change your diet  you know what  it might be  something to do  with it  what do you think  fucks that up  do you know  there's a lot  of things  I bet gluten  and I also think  dairy  those two things  probably have a big  effect  gluten has a huge  effect on inflammation  huge effect  makes a lot of  people inflame  joints  and then you  stop doing that  and all of a sudden  you have like  a lot of relief  and a lot of things  that are bothering you  so my nose 
[03:28:30]  might be better  if I didn't take  like I only drink  skim milk in the  morning with my  coffee  that's it  yeah but you got  a lot of yogurt  oh yeah  I do  you normally  don't eat yogurt  I just started  because shit  I went for acupuncture  and it cleared up  my allergies  and sinuses  and stuff  it's worked great  really  yeah  I don't buy that  shit  fuckery  yeah  it worked for me  man  yeah I rarely get  about 85%  I lumped that in  with Chinese dudes  eating rhino horn  to make their dick hard  yeah  it's probably the act  of hurting the animal 
[03:29:00]  that turns them on  I don't know  if it's real  I mean I've heard  people say it's real  but I've done it  before and it did  fucking absolutely  fuck all  yeah  do a god damn thing  you would take  a Cialis  I tell you  western medicine  has figured  certain things out  and fucking  and my fucking  punchable dick  on a Cialis  Ray Kurzweil would be proud  my fucking dick  just leaps to attention  Cialis rules  you don't need to kill tigers  you fucks  absolutely  leave the animals alone  pop a pill  yeah 
[03:29:30]  there's a  and yeah  there's a lot of those  things that they figured out  that's a lot better  than fucking acupuncture  yeah no shit  I guess we're ending now  it's 10 o'clock  oh yeah look at that  but Joe man  thanks for calling  and I love the fact  that you and Dana  and just you speak  you're very very honest  and I think that really  helps the integrity  of the sport a lot  well we're fans of the sport  and that's the number one thing  and I can't stand  seeing things like this happen  where people win a fight  but lose a fight  where you see  terrible judging  going uncorrected 
[03:30:00]  over and over  and over again  yeah  there's a real issue  in the sport  and I had a call  on you guys  and can I say  Bruce Buffer  I don't know  if he's ever done  a better job  than he did  announcing that fucking  that was one of the  greatest announcing jobs  I think ever done  was him introducing  GSP and Johnny Hendricks  ooh was he fucking good  does it ever  he gets fired up  he gets fired up  I never get tired  now I watch the old  Tyson fights  and that guy goes  it's show time  and I'm like  oh fucking  capital B 
[03:30:30]  oh  oh  oh  yeah  this man needs  no introduction  in the whole world  around  oh yuck  yeah that's some  old timey shit  from the old days  I'm like  fighter  yeah and he fucking  jams the card in your face  just daring you  to not fight  Buffer's face  gets bright red  and he's fucking  screaming  yeah  it's  fire  dude what  what a voice  what a powerful  fucking voice  yeah he's the best 
[03:31:00]  he's the best  and he's been doing it  for a long time  you know  he's been involved  in the UFC  longer than me  and I started in 97  have you been there  that long  yeah  yeah I was  I was a post fight  interviewer  at UFC 12  1997  who's your first  interview  Mark Coleman  I interviewed Mark  Coleman after he beat  Dan Severin  to win the  UFC heavyweight title  the first UFC  heavyweight title  I was a skinny  little fresh faced buck  aww  I was like a kid  in a candy shop 
[03:31:30]  I was in my 20's  and I was like  oh I can't believe  I'm here  woo  I was in  Alabama  just happy to be there  yeah  that's how I was  at AVN  it was like porn  it was like  the disgusting thing  that people were  involved with  it was by no means  mainstream  very fringe  well Joe Rogan  thanks  I missed the fuck  out of you guys  I'm coming in a day  early  in February  for the UFC  in Jersey  just to hang with you  oh cool man  yeah  and I'll see you

[03:37:30]  here's your  host  Sam Roberts  oh god  here we go  you know  that voice  by now  DJ  Who Kid  is here  what up  god  also joining  us  the famous  Andrew  Schultz  hey  what's up  you're a TV  star now  this is the  craziest thing  that's happened  because I try to  keep up with  what's going on  on MTV  okay  I know  you know 
[03:38:00]  I'm 30 now  so I'm officially  way out of the  demo  okay  but I try to  at least keep up  so I know  what's going on  you know what I mean  and like I'm  watching and first  this show  guy code is on  and then the show  guy codes on  like every day  all day  and I'm like  this show  they love this show  then they take  and guy code  is  it's kind of like  best week ever  except just talking  about the shit  that guys do  when they're dating  and all that shit  then  MTV is like  look  we love the 
[03:38:30]  guy code guys  this is the show  apparently it's the  only show on the  network that's working  because they launch  girl code  and then they give  everybody who's on  guy code  like a hundred  different spin off  shows  so now  if you don't know  who Andrew Schultz  is by name  turn on MTV  he's the guy  with the good hair  who's not  Chris DiStefano  who's on every show  I'm the other white guy  you got the Elvis  thing going on  right  you got what  you got a little Elvis  smoothness  how long does it  take you to get  your hair  I mean your hair 
[03:39:00]  I figured MTV helps  but your hair is  TV ready now  this is five minutes  in the morning  that's it  I do use a blow dryer  which might be  a guy code violation  I would think so  it really might be  but at the same time  it takes like  five minutes  or even less  it's so fast  get out of the shower  I blow dry my hair  it's kind of like  a short pompadour  yeah  look at these hair  connoisseurs  they're so perfect though  I keep going  I love this  you use jelly  and stuff like that  I use jelly 
[03:39:30]  yeah I use  I use a marmalade  tangerine actually  that's what that smell is  niggas use grape  you know what I'm saying  look who kid  I'm in the same category  my hair  my hair is more  in your camp  just cause you shave  your shit down  doesn't mean it's  I like that  but your camp  that's a polite way  of saying  I have black hair  yeah  yes  I'm gonna start  using that in life  now  camps  I was a little late  to this interview  you know  more like your camp 
[03:40:00]  it's not racist  if you're describing  them as camps  but I watch guys  like you on TV  like just  it's never gonna happen  for me  cause I can't do  anything  with this  that is  your hair is already  on TV  yeah  it's ready  you mean  no it's been on TV  what  in the Simpsons  oh  I'm sure you've  gotten that before  yeah here and there  here and there  no but I think  I think  specific hair  makes people remember you  I don't know if mine  is really that  that interesting 
[03:40:30]  but I know that  I'm not gonna forget  your hair  that's where MTV  made up for it  they were like  look he doesn't have  the most memorable hair  in the world  so we have to make sure  he's on the network  at all times  buzz it right  yeah  you're too memorable  you got a mouth  I can't forget to  what does that mean  look at them both  yesterday  on Friday  don't roll right past that  who kids have been  getting weird lately  oh where were you  this week  that Molly's still  in the system  Tyler  yeah he's world traveling 
[03:41:00]  he came in on  it was either Thursday  or Friday  yeah  you told me I look cute  I mean no  I mean motherfucking cute  there's a difference  yeah  oh  like you got a nice mouth  like if we were in prison  like it would be your mouth  yeah but we're not in prison  you know I always wondered  how he shaved like  around there  like  around my mouth  like everything  the chin  it's like one set hair  I don't know  it looks like  what are you talking about  like the Simpsons  like he just said  like it's like a Simpson thing  going on  even with the mouth part  I don't know  do you know what that means  Homer Simpson 
[03:41:30]  I know you're trying  you're trying to go with him  right  fuck out of this conversation  can I say  you can say fuck  alright cool  I don't know  does MTV watch what you do now  or they like  that is true  sorry guys  sorry if I come  I apologize for saying  the afterword  they're teenagers listening  come on  okay  Snooki can get punched  but I will never say  an F-bomb on Rick  what do you mean  I have one  thing of hair  when you look at  Homer Simpson  the way they draw him  like the bottom part  of his mouth  it reminds me  of your bottom part 
[03:42:00]  now I think  what he's trying to say  is that  this is messed up  but no Simpsons  have a chin  and that'd be really funny  and you have a chin  here's my chin right here  it's all connected  it feels like  I can take it apart  okay so you mean  instead of  instead of like  individual hair follicles  it looks like  my hair was painted on  on my face  is that it  that 5 o'clock shadow look  is what he's trying to say  but I don't think it is  your chin is not  all I see is a mouth  weird  he really loves that mouth  it's getting really weird  in you  get out of your mouth  man 
[03:42:30]  yeah  immediately  please  so  oh  we're just gonna  5 shows  5 shows  yeah  5 shows  is that how many shows  you have on MTV  5  is that the correct number  yeah  the 5th is gonna premiere  Jesus  in March  that's crazy  I like  I like your shows though  because they keep me informed  like I was sitting there  because when I went to high school  it was like  people were just starting  to get digital cameras  everybody was emailing  and AOL instant messaging 
[03:43:00]  and all that stuff  but nobody  there was no such thing as  Facebook and Twitter  and all that stuff  so I remember  going to high school  and the one day  there was one girl  who had naked pictures  leak of her in high school  it happened once  throughout all of high school  and it was like  the biggest thing  that ever happened  some  she sent them to her boyfriend  the guy who didn't like  her boyfriend  hacked into her boyfriend's  email account  found the pictures  and then just  printed off on paper  a ton of copies  and handed them out 
[03:43:30]  all throughout school  printed  like flyers  like everybody  you gotta see this  you gotta see this  breaking news  extra extra  read all about it  right  and that's what it was  all about  what was it  was it  was it titties  it was titties  it was pussy  it was everything  it was multiple photos  damn  just a 2 megapixel picture  of pussy  right  but you knew the girl  just a blurry labia  but you knew the labia  you knew who the labia  was connected to  so it was so much more exciting  oh dude that's the best 
[03:44:00]  yeah  and you'd go around  because you know  they had to pass them out quick  so they didn't get caught  but there were multiple photos  so you had to go  and find out  which ones your friends got  to see if you saw them all  and it was crazy  but now  like your  new  your game show  that you're on  it's like the new dating game  it's a dating show  but it's basically  you take  a guy and a girl  and you go through  the shit that they have  on social media  and expose it  oh shit  get out of here  and like now  all these girls  are like posting videos 
[03:44:30]  of themselves  like  what  just ratchet videos  get the fuck out of here  yeah  going like  let me tell you  something here  and just talking about  anything  imaginable  they're wearing  no clothes  that's not  no kidding  no  it's called  your camp  okay  yeah  it is  yeah exactly  it's you know  it's basically  the dating show  for our generation  wow  which is  because when you date  now  you're going to look  at some girl  on the internet  or look at her  Instagram  look at her Twitter 
[03:45:00]  so we basically  just look at all that  stuff  and then  show it to that person  it's amazing  how much is there  oh dude  you know what I mean  like it's not just  mundane tweets  do you know what I mean  yeah  like literally  everything we've posted  since we were in college  is still  on Facebook  so that's crazy  yeah  every status update  that's why I think  that at some point  like I felt like  when Anthony Weiner  was running  now Rob Ford  is going crazy  like these people  should just be left  in office  and realize  that this is the new  thing  because within 
[03:45:30]  I don't know  10-15 years  everybody's gonna  have that shit  dude  available for everyone  I was thinking  about this exact  same thing  like how  how are we  gonna elect  a president  that grew up  with social media  right  like you gotta  have dick pics  you know what I mean  like you have to  or at least  something embarrassing  there's no way  nothing bad  has been documented  throughout your entire life  yeah I mean  because you sent it  it's not like 
[03:46:00]  anybody  even if all you did  was take dick pics  on your phone  you texted them  to somebody  and you think  that they're just  gonna keep them  in their phone  when you're president  you think they're  just gonna stay  I know  nobody deletes  dick pics  ever  fuck no  you never  like nobody  deletes those  you tell people  you deleted them  but you keep them  forever  not to mention  the CIA  has a copy  of your cock  what are you  talking about  the CIA  and your mouth  yeah  they got a picture  of your mouth  Obama's like 
[03:46:30]  damn  but it's like  I would assume  that they're just  gonna  the whole standard  is gonna be changed  like when there's  a scandal about somebody  it's gonna be  the most ridiculous  raunchy  thing  because  the stuff  that we've all done  it's gonna be obvious  that we've all done it  that's the other thing  is like  is it not shocking anymore  like are we gonna get  to a point where  you know  seeing  you know  the first lady's  boobs  or seeing her  on spring break  is like  whatever  yeah because 
[03:47:00]  you're gonna realize  well I got that shit  about me too  so we just accept  that now we're a culture  where everybody  sees titties  and  and vaginas  and vaginas  like that's why  I think that  Anthony Weiner  we should've just said  alright put that guy  in office  and let's start  this thing rolling now  exactly  start the ball  yeah  he's a gay guy  right  Anthony Weiner's not  no man  he kept texting  his dick to women  I thought it was to men  no  why would you think that  alright whatever  just cause his name  is Weiner  that's not where 
[03:47:30]  that was going  at all  he wasn't the one  that got caught  by his wife  with a dude  oh that's the other guy  no that's the guy  from Jersey  Patterson  no is it  Patterson was blind  no  man we  well there was the one  there was the one guy  the governor Patterson  was blind  there was a blind one  I was in front of him  the other day  he was blind  yeah that was Patterson  he said what up to you  he saw me  he didn't see you  he was blind  swear to god  he saw me  he said  what did he say  he said what up  no he didn't  just lie so much 
[03:48:00]  I'm lying  I'm lying  but  but yeah  there was that one dude  who was in the bathroom stall  that was tapping  the guy's foot  McGreevy right  McGreevy  no that wasn't  McGreevy tapping his foot  not in the bathroom stall  McGreevy did something  what did McGreevy  McGreevy  he was the gay governor  yeah he was the one  he was the one  he said I'm a gay American  he's like yeah I'm a gay American  the other guy  who was in the bathroom stall  just said he had a wide stance  he wouldn't come clean with it 
[03:48:30]  wow  really  yes  that was a couple years ago though  yeah McGreevy was the one  who just had to come out of the closet  but it's the same thing  a wide stance  it's like now  you can come out  and be a gay dude  and probably get elected  without a big deal  whereas 15 years ago  that was never gonna happen  yeah totally  I mean there have been gay people elected  yeah  15 years from now  that's great  15 years from now  it's hard to take you seriously  I gotta be honest with you  wow  I'm being honest  I know  I know  I think it's a great thing  I'm serious 
[03:49:00]  15  one day we're gonna be able  to elect a DJ  I hope not  I hope not  I'm gonna be a nigga  I'm bringing the bitches  back on a stroll  like Goldie Wilson  nobody in New York's  gonna need a license  fuck licenses  fuck that license yo  yeah  you drive whatever you wanna drive  whenever you wanna drive  and FedEx is free  that's a hell of a campaign  if you need to get your weed shipment  from San Francisco  FedEx will ship it to your house  I won't vote for Andrew  Andrew  Andrew might be our next fucking 
[03:49:30]  because he'd have you in mind  he'd have you in mind  yeah  yeah man  so  everybody gets a half fare bus pass  I didn't even know they still have that  remember those  well you don't need a bus pass  because you drive without a license  everywhere  an ignorant phantom  I love it  when you're going through people's Twitters  like these teens  how old are the people on this dating show  everybody's gotta be at least 18  okay  so when you're going  but they probably won't go much past 20 
[03:50:00]  because MTV's like  we don't want to  hell no  we don't want old people  exactly  no I would say  probably 24  is the cutoff  so when you're going through these people's  Twitters and Facebooks and stuff  you don't get to do it  I'm assuming  nah  but they all have to bring me the stuff  like I gotta see all the stuff  and just sign off on it  and do they ever say like  Jesus Christ  this is filthy  like we can't  this we can't do  oh yeah  what have you found  oh just  I mean there's a lot of nudity  we see a lot of nudity  and MTV will blur it out  but it's just like the  like the raging misogyny 
[03:50:30]  they're a little bit  you know MTV's  majority girls  watch the network  so like when a guy's got a tweet  that says  fuck bitches  yeah yeah  gotta edit that out  fuck bitches  you only got a tight throat  I don't want nothing to do with you  you know what I mean  why is it  I'm shocked when I talk about balls  punched a bitch in her jaw today  lol  esophagus  esophagus  oh man  so they'll blur out the nudity  but they won't really go with the  yeah like  hardcore  misogyny 
[03:51:00]  exactly right  now  are any of the girls surprised  when you're like  look I found this naked photo of you on Twitter  they're just mortified  they're not like  funny  did they not realize it was coming  it's just  it's one thing to put it up there  cause you really think that it's just you and your friends looking at it  like you don't really think that the world is looking at it  and then just to be in front of a crowd of people  and knowing that your parents are gonna watch  and just like  and you're just passed out in an elevator  yeah  you know what I mean  it's just great  but that's how Kim Kardashian feels  every time she's out there  yeah she  we know what she's 
[03:51:30]  looks like inside  inside of her  yeah  yeah  like everybody knows that already  I don't know that pussy  if she and Kanye West  God forbid  separate  oh man  and she finds herself a new man  that man will already know  what she looks like inside  that's why  I mean I give Kanye credit  especially for that line  where he said  my girl's a star off of her home movie  yeah  that's gangster  and he says  cause like now you can't  he did like the Eminem 8 Mile thing  where  you can't make fun of me  for something  I take pride in  right  I wonder if he really takes pride in it 
[03:52:00]  or if he's just like  what's the best way to word this  either way  it works  cause I can't be like  yeah your girl's just a star off of her home movie  he's like yeah I said that  I mentioned that already  you don't listen to my music  we already went through that  it was a huge single  it was a fake head  Jay was on it  yeah  yo man  Kanye West is God man  you think so  that is Jesus Christ  what makes you say that  cause Jesus Christ  you know  he respected the sluts  did he  did they throw rocks at them bitches  back in the days  I guess  I guess  I mean 
[03:52:30]  I was reading this Hebrew book the other day  you're saying cause Kanye didn't throw rocks  at Kim Kardashian  he married her  no cause Mary Magdalene  obviously  you know  some people say she was a prostitute  right  okay  okay  and so you're saying  he's messing with Kim  wow that's interesting  maybe he is  I mean I love  it's like you know  reincarnated  like you know  I love when people meet DJ Hooker  for the first time  cause they're like you  like they think he's funny  and they want to take his side  and they're trying to find  some kind of rationality  in what he's saying 
[03:53:00]  superlative  but you know what he does  he sees you  and he's like  okay  Andrew Schultz is like  he's going with me on this  I'm gonna keep going  more and more absurd  superlative  I like it  you do  see yeah  cause that's more fun  for me to argue  exactly  you know I'd rather argue that  than argue like  2 plus 2 is 4  right  well that's not arguable  that's definitely 4  so it's like  so give me something crazy  like Kanye is Jesus  I just  I just find it weird  that like Jesus would come back  and  and all of a sudden  be so into clothes  yeah  and leather jogging pants 
[03:53:30]  he had one outfit  for 33 years  yeah  he was wearing Gucci  Jesus I don't think so  I think it was just bed sheets  nah he wears Gucci now  now  it'll be easy  I also don't think  if Jesus came back  he would start calling himself  Yeezus  I think he would just  if he's gonna go that far  he'd probably just  come clean  why do you think  I wear Gucci now  cause I'm following the leader  the God  you considered  Kanye West your personal savior  wow  DJ Hookah's wearing Gucci sneakers  you know Kanye has a license  oh shit for real 
[03:54:00]  let's not get that crazy  ain't no nigga there  when do you get to start  sell out  sell out motherfucker  getting a license and shit  what you gonna do  pay taxes next  how are the taxes  who kid  who me  yeah  what  you pay taxes  hell no nigga  Jesus Christ  he's joking  he's joking  Danny  you can't say that  IRS agents  out there  they will come after you  of course they will  you know Waka Flocka  of course  Waka Flocka Flame 
[03:54:30]  dude  so Waka Flocka  you wanna hear real quick  Waka Flocka  before you get into yours  he was in this building  the other day  I don't even think  I told you who kid  get the fuck out of here  and we were sitting  in our office  Waka Flocka Flame  is this giant rapper  he's like  how tall is he  6 foot 4  6 foot 4  I thought he was  a lot shorter  6 foot 3  he's like 6'3  6'4  big black dude  with dreadlocks  and he's all tatted up  and everything  tall nigga  and he walks  well come on  maybe your camp  can get away  with saying that  but  he walks 
[03:55:00]  he walks by my office  our office  all of us  are in there  and he just sticks his head  and he goes  excuse me  you guys got a sec  and we all looked  and we were like  yeah  what does Waka Flocka Flame  want with us  and he goes  just wanted to let you know  you can save a bunch of money  by switching to guy code  and I was like  I was like  oh  get the fuck out of here  thanks  thanks Waka Flocka Flame  and he just keeps walking  oh that's a great story  and I was like  are you serious  yeah  oh I would do that too 
[03:55:30]  if I was Waka Flocka Flame  oh shit  yeah  so what were you saying  about Waka Flocka  nah I can't follow  oh I would have saved him  for after then  shit that's a great  mine's just regular  he told me he put  30 G's on Instagram  and the IRS  called him personally  well of course  but I didn't know  that the IRS  follows you  on fucking social media  I didn't know that  that's how the IRS works  but apparently  if you're putting  a lot of money out there  it will get back to them  and they'll literally be like  hey where's this money  coming from 
[03:56:00]  are you showing income  he put 30,000 in cash  on Instagram  like a picture of it  just isn't like  look what I have  and he said  they called his fucking house  wow  that's crazy  how'd they even find his number  I don't even know  what his real name is  oh this is where we go  back to the CIA  nigga  okay I understand  conspiracy  it's not a conspiracy  if somebody posts  30,000 in cash  in the IRS  there's no conspiracy  about it  that should be declared  oh okay  right  I do that all the time  though  no you don't  I've never seen  30,000 dollars  on Instagram  what's a guy code  now for that 
[03:56:30]  like is it  is it gonna be  a nigga code  like  do you think  maybe  look  that might be  a big show  right there  Andrew  a nigga code  pitch it  I think you should  pitch it  and at least  get a producer credit  you probably  I think that'd be  that'd be great  to have my name  on that  just a bunch  of black dudes  and then Andrew Schultz  brought to you  by Andrew Schultz  that would be great  if the MTV  like after getting  all these MTV shows  the ego just  completely goes to  your brain  and you start  coming in  like you just  run  I got an idea  fuck MTV  I'm going to  BET with this 
[03:57:00]  I didn't want to say it  I didn't want to say  BET  I give up  you're a comedian  by trade  stand up  and MTV  what  they see you  and they're like  oh we're putting  together this show  you want to be  a part of it  well they saw  a video of me  and I did like  a New Year's Eve  bash  remember MTV  did these  New Year's Eve  things  so I did one  of those  where I did  some talking  head  kind of  best week  ever  type stuff  and then  Geico came  along  and then  the woman  who brought  me in  pitched me 
[03:57:30]  to MTV2  for Geico  because Geico's  on MTV2  and then  just took off  from there  man  and just  the rest  is  now do they  like  American Idol  own you  they  I have a deal  with them  it's not as  exclusive as  American Idol  American Idol  owns you  they own you  yeah  from audition  to like  if you make it  in front of  any of those  judges  that's 10 years  of your life  gone  that's it  nothing  that's why  that dude  the guy  from Daughtry  was he American Idol  yeah 
[03:58:00]  his name's  Daughtry  but that's  that's the genius  of his thing  he was signed  as an individual  artist  right  and then  they had him  but he didn't  want to be  with them anymore  so he started  a band  called  oh shit  Daughtry  this is what  my girl was  telling me  so and now  they buttoned  that shit up  in the contracts  but  but back then  they didn't  exactly  so he just  starts Daughtry  and he's on  his own  as the band  he's a genius  so he finds  the loophole  where I can  call the band  Daughtry  but it's a band  these are my boys 
[03:58:30]  I don't go anywhere  without them  exactly  wow  as an individual artist  he signed to  I guess  you know  American Idol  or X-Fact  or whatever it is  so Daughtry  from Daughtry  can't go solo  and just  be Daughtry  or Chris  he just has to go  he just has to go  Chris now  whatever his first name  is  but he's got  his band's name  is Daughtry  he probably has  majority creative  control  I have a feeling  that he might  have his hand  in it  my god  you know  any of his records  he could sing  something for us  what is it  are you getting  flirty today  no I'm not  I think you might 
[03:59:00]  still be on Molly  we love your mouth  anymore  we love your mouth  now you're asking  me to sing you songs  it's really fucking  weird in here  like  oh the Daughtry  is here Friday  on this  on ONA  wow  holy shit  I'm gonna slip  that info  to ONA  maybe we should  fact check that  but I'm pretty sure  man  I'm pretty sure  let's phrase that  in the form of a question  yeah yeah  they'll be like  so we heard  from Andrew Schultz  yeah yeah  you know  from Guy Code  you're like no  I don't know 
[03:59:30]  so are you worried  now that MTV  is putting you on  every different show  on the whole channel  like they've decided  okay  we're just gonna make  you on the channel  forever  are you worried  about overexposure  like you get  all this big hit  and you get fame  now  but then if everybody  gets sick of you  it's like  oh shit  you gotta keep  on coming with it  I guess  but what happens  if they're like  no we don't  want to see  your face anymore  you know  that's the weird  thing is that  like you know  I see guys like  you know  who do radio 
[04:00:00]  for example  yourself  this is everyday  yes  you know  so people  I think  appreciate  when you see  somebody  and you like  what they do  if it's a trick  if they're tricking you  you can't take  a lot of it  but if it's genuine  and if it's real  then they want to hear  it as much as they can  so they'll listen  to you everyday  they'll listen to  Opie and Anthony  they'll listen to  Howard everyday  so you feel like  as long as you're  being yourself  that's what I invest  in is myself  I'm just trying to  you know  I'm being myself  that is the investment  when I got into  this business 
[04:00:30]  it's like  okay I believe  that this is something  that people fuck with  so I'm just investing  in that  and I think  the people  that watch  especially MTV2  who are doing it  with a bunch  of different people  instead of creating  like stars of a show  they've really  kind of marketed  the network  around us  so they just  found real cool  vehicles  and then threw  us in these vehicles  it's like the new  VJs  yeah  honestly  somebody just said  that to me  the other day  they're like  you guys  you guys  are stand-ups  but what's  happened  is kind of  like what  happened  with VJs  back in  what is it  like the 90s  yeah  with MTV 
[04:01:00]  they were on  a bunch of  different things  and people  fuck with  like you like  seeing these  different  but it's great  for you guys  because now  that MTV  doesn't play  music anymore  it's just  VJs  so you get  all the air  time  no  like there's  no Bon Jovi  video  comedians  back then  they were just  generic  exactly  because  half of them  were radio  people  there were a lot  of radios  Carson did radio  yeah  there were a lot  of radios  and now  obviously  because comedy  you know  comedy themed  programming  is really popular  now  so they just  brought comedians  in and it's 
[04:01:30]  dude it's the best  man  we get to tour  so the bitches  the bitches be  sweating you guys  oh man  I got a girl  do you  I do  I got a girl  for how long  I've been with my girl  since before I was on TV  oh what are you doing  what are you doing  this is it  I know  this is it  ask DJ  are you married  hell fucking yeah  but you get all these  you get all these gigs  do you fuck bitches  I love this shit  because  this is what  these motherfuckers  this is what  they tell their wives  this is what  they tell their wives  oh it's just  entertainment babe  it's all  entertainment 
[04:02:00]  just entertainment  I just say that  on the radio  I still get my dick sucked  but true or false  DJ Hukit  you cheat on your wife  regularly  every week baby  every week  this is so crazy  it's so crazy  I came in a girl  last week  this asshole  mother fucker  the trick is  she good though  she good  Hukit admits  to so much absurd stuff  that you assume  that he's joking  and he's not  he's a dickhead  he's telling the truth  he's a bad person  real god 
[04:02:30]  I appreciate it man  so you've been with the same girl  since before you were famous  yeah man  but she's after famous hot  okay  so you still outdid yourself  I'm still outdid myself  how'd you do that  before you were famous  man I mean  you have a sparkling personality  I don't know what it is man  she fucked up  she fucked up  but now you're famous  so she's like  I can't leave  because now he's famous  I got her locked in  right  so I gotta keep on  she got the strawberry  she got that 
[04:03:00]  but let me tell you  she got the magic  she got the sunshine  are you gonna marry her  yeah man  I'm gonna marry her  are you engaged  no no I'm not engaged  but you will be engaged  yeah yeah  she's the one  I gotta bring to the club  yeah you should  because let me tell you something  what club  I want DJ  one old greenhouse  and whip  oh yeah okay cool man  so if I'm gonna come through  and get some  well  I'll look at some strange  I'll enjoy watching you  take part  because the thing is though  I do enjoy that though 
[04:03:30]  what  you just like to watch  not literally watching someone smash  but like  yeah  if you did it  and then showed me pictures  same thing you were telling me  about the girls pictures  yes  there's something about  oh this is great  DJ who just passed him his phone  immediately  oh great  and there's just these two girls  that are blacked out  on top of each other  just assholes open in the air  that's called the pancake  that's called the pancake  really  there's a name for it  and I'm the syru  you're married  why can't you be a classy individual  like Andrew Schultz 
[04:04:00]  and vicariously lives it  through somebody else  nah god  that's not you  nah dude  keep living like this  and send me these shits  bitches  I'm gonna give you an email account  my girl doesn't know about you  send me these  some kind of secret  Vine account or something  Rick that is a pink pussy right there  holy shit  it is like amazingly pink  yeah I went in there  that's why  you did  you finished in there  both of them shits  wow dude  so there's gonna be a DJ who kid  I couldn't believe it 
[04:04:30]  kid  yeah of course  you probably have children  all over the place  how many kids do you have  I got two sons  two sons  that's what's up man  but they're by your wife  yeah of course  right  and then you're done  that's it man  are you tied  nah  no I mean he's done fucking his wife  no cause some people tie  oh don't fucking his wife  yeah he's gonna be fucking other people now  he's done having sex with that woman  baby I gave you two kids  what more do you want me to be faithful  that's crazy  yeah  I'm the pull out king right now man  exactly so 
[04:05:00]  I think the pull out method works better than people  are you making big money yet  or is MTV not giving you big money  I mean I'm doing well man  I'm doing well  because  let me tell you  the fact that you were with this girl  from before you were famous  when you get married  you told me you're gonna get married  when you get married  I'm not gonna ask for it  you're not gonna ask for a prenup  nah  dude  she will get everything  if you divorce  because she will say  that she was there from the beginning  she was  and she brought you all  like she brought you to your show  she was  she was there from the beginning 
[04:05:30]  I'm look  I believe in that kind of stuff like that  this show is gonna be played in a courtroom  in a courtroom  but here's it  honestly  I'm being dead serious  I know it sounds corny  I don't chase money  so like I'll just make more money  what  I don't chase it  it's never  you never  yeah but what happens  when you're not like  this young handsome cool dude anymore  who could be on MTV  like what happens when you're 50  and you're like  that's why I bust my ass doing stand up  they can never take stand up away from you  if you're great  as stand up  you know what I mean  you always have the road  you always have your fans  you make more money doing that
