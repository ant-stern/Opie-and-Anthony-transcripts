<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a post-show discussion featuring Opie, Anthony, Sam Roberts, Roland, E-Rock, Enrico Spave, and Sal.  The primary focus was a graphic and highly detailed account of Sal's recent sexual encounter, specifically his failure to achieve orgasm despite multiple attempts.  The conversation was rife with crude humor and commentary from all participants analyzing Sal's sexual performance.  The discussion extended into Sal's relationships, including his relationship with Opie, debated based on the semantics of Sal's word choice regarding their past conversations ("have" versus "had"). Sal's tendency to lie was a recurring theme.  The segment included listener calls, one from a caller claiming to be Sal's boyfriend, a claim Sal vehemently denied.

A "Line of the Day" segment featured several contenders, ultimately awarding the prize to Sal's confession of needing "a little ass play" to climax.  Sal's personal style—his mustache and cardigans—became a target of teasing,  as did his perceived femininity and his objectification of women in the context of his sexual performance. A significant portion of the conversation revolved around Sam Roberts' blog for layfieldreport.com, focusing on wrestling news and pop culture commentary.  The show also previewed upcoming guests Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka and Dan Soder, incorporating audio clips from past Snuka appearances.  The show concluded with announcements of upcoming segments. Throughout the entire post-show segment, the language was consistently profane, laden with crude sexual humor, and included numerous personal attacks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All right, all right.  See, after Opie and Anthony live show with me, Sam Roberts, Roland, E-Rock, Enrico Spave,  and Sal.  Did you ever think all that information was going to come out about you? 
[00:00:30]  Oh, I totally knew it was.  If you missed that first hour of today's show, I would say even, Nikolai, even including Nikolai,  my favorite was the first hour of today's show.  I didn't hear it.  Oh my God, Roland, what do you mean you didn't hear it?  I didn't.  What were you doing?  Um, sleeping.  Oh, Roland.  You got to wake up for this shit.  I know.  Sal, it came out, well, Sal almost came out.  No.  That, uh, that he had, uh, had intercourse with somebody who works here, and we got 
[00:01:00]  into the whole thing.  He had sex with this girl who, we all, makes treats.  Huh?  Makes treats.  Well, we all agreed that she was super hot.  Yeah.  And he couldn't come.  He tried six times.  Poor fella.  And he couldn't make it happen.  Have you thought about that at all?  Like after, yeah, fuck yeah.  He sounds like, he's like Notre Dame.  Just couldn't make it happen.  No.  No.  Roll Tide.  Bama won.  Um, what, I mean, have you thought about that, especially after today's analysis of it, 
[00:01:30]  and the guys' opinions of what's going on, and, does it make you question things?  No, in a way I've had, like, you know, closure about it, because now, like, it's out in the  open, you know, it doesn't matter.  But it doesn't make you question, like, why?  I, no, it doesn't make me question anything.  Okay.  And you don't think it's a little weird?  Maybe his mom's going, Barry Manlow does this for me.  I don't know what that means, but, you know what I mean?  I don't know what that, I don't know.  Makes her cum.  I guess, but he didn't cum.  I know, that's what I mean.  He had to find his Barry Manlow. 
[00:02:00]  Are you turned on by Barry Manlow?  No, I'm not turned on by Barry Manlow.  But it doesn't make you question things?  No.  Just one of those things for you?  Yeah.  Okay.  Have you had sex with any other girls since her?  Uh, no.  That's a lie?  Maybe that's a lie.  Well, I can tell you're lying to me right now, because you think she might be listening.  What?  Are you lying to me because you think she might be listening?  Who?  The girl you were talking about earlier.  Oh, I don't know.  Oh, okay.  You haven't had sex with anybody else since her? 
[00:02:30]  Um...  Well, how could you not remember?  No, I...  Uh...  Yes.  Yeah, okay, yeah.  That's how I knew you were...  See, remember when I said you were lying?  Well, no, I had to think about, like...  Right, no, yes was the answer.  What's the right thing, like, the way to say it?  Yes was the right answer.  Right, I mean, because you said no, and the right way to say it would have been...  Yes!  Yes.  Right, okay, there you go.  That's one of the reasons why I have to take off this mustache.  Because the girl you're seeing said she didn't like it?  Yeah.  It was awful.  Is that true?  Yeah.  I think you're like, get out. 
[00:03:00]  I'm not lying.  I don't want to talk.  I'm telling you the truth.  Eric, Sal's starting to give me the creeps now, too.  I can't tell when he's lying.  Like, I think...  Like, he's looking at me...  Sam, I didn't lie once today.  I felt it was very cathartic to just be honest with ONA and just tell them everything.  That's because yesterday you lied about your relationship with Opie.  Well, it wasn't really lying.  It was.  No, it wasn't lying.  Eric, he said yesterday, I talked to Opie off the air, correct?  Yes, they talked...  And that's why there's not a lot of...  Music and sports.  Right.  Not I have spoken to.  It's I currently talk to. 
[00:03:30]  Like, it's an active thing.  No, I didn't say it was current.  No, you messed up.  I have the clip of that, of Sal talking about his relationship with Opie, if you want that.  Let me hear it.  Oh, wait.  There we go.  Now, what...  That sounds like me.  ...in the history of yours and Opie's relationship makes you think that deep down Opie likes you?  Stop.  What in the history...  There it is, right there.  You didn't...  I wasn't finished with your clip.  You didn't listen to your answer.  No, I know, but I'm saying the question was...  All right, so...  ...in the history.  Should we listen to the answer, maybe? 
[00:04:00]  Yes, you should hear it first.  And then get to the point?  Yeah, yeah.  All right, so maybe this time, Eric, we'll also listen to the answer.  Yeah, I'll start it again.  Okay, perfect.  Now, what...  ...in the history of yours and Opie's relationship makes you think that deep down Opie likes you?  I guess the conversations we have are fair.  We have?  Okay.  What do you guys talk about?  What?  He said, I guess the conversations we have off-air.  Right.  You don't have them anymore.  But they have happened.  So you would say we had, if you were not being misleading. 
[00:04:30]  Well, by saying have doesn't make it past or present.  It makes it present.  Have is present.  It's a conjugated verb.  Have is...  Had is past.  Have is present.  All right, so the one fucking word is debunking this right now.  Yes, it's the word.  Okay.  It describes the action.  So me and Obe didn't speak.  If I'm holding a glass of milk, do I have a glass of milk or would I say I had a glass of milk? 
[00:05:00]  You'd be like, no, you're holding it right now.  Yeah, but...  You have it.  Yeah, but...  Or if I said to this, hey, Sal, I have a glass of milk, you'd be like, no, you do not, Sam.  I see your hand.  It's empty.  Correct?  All right.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  Have you come?  Right.  Right.  Have you?  Well, yeah.  You jerk off plenty, right?  QVC.  You jerk off to QVC?  Fuck yeah.  You could jerk off an order, good shit.  Oh, okay.  So you jerk off, buy yourself a popcorn maker.  Maybe. 
[00:05:30]  Easy pickings.  I buy like a nice soft blanket.  Did you come with the girl that you...  Yes.  You did?  Yes.  Why?  Because it was raw.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  So be it.  Let's go to 205.  Dip that dick in the hole.  Dip that dick in the hole?  What's up?  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  Hey, this is one of Sal's partners here.  I don't like you talking out of school.  Look, I'm not gay.  My boyfriend is.  All right, Sal.  Now you've got angry boyfriends calling up the show.  I didn't mean to upset anybody. 
[00:06:00]  I've never had a boyfriend in my life.  That guy just...  You're telling me that that guy was lying.  Yes, he was.  That's ridiculous.  I knew his area code.  He wouldn't have lied to me.  Yeah, that's true.  Eric, we should do line of the day.  The guys didn't get to do it.  Can we do that?  Yes, we can do that.  Okay, how many runners-ups do we have?  We have three runners-ups.  Okay, let's play the first...  They're all from Nikolai.  Why?  Because that's all he listens to.  Because that's all he listens to.  I was about to say, it wasn't that funny.  All right, let's play the third runner-up, then.  Refreshing to hear what the average Joe is thinking. 
[00:06:30]  Give me a container of coffee on a construction site.  I'm just talking.  Oh, those look delicious.  Let me just smash my crackers.  How does Jim smashing his crackers get line of the day?  It doesn't.  It's a runner-up, but it was funny.  But it's not a line.  It's an action.  It's his pre-shit.  It's what?  Before he went to take a shit.  He goes, I like that line.  It's his pre-shit.  What?  Yeah, he picks a line before he takes a shit.  Did you just pick a line right before you shit?  No, I didn't go anywhere today. 
[00:07:00]  You didn't shit today?  No.  All right, well, you were wrong.  Well, I'm concerned now for his bells.  I would say that that was not a line.  That was an action.  That wasn't a line.  Oh.  All right, what's the second?  Oh, what's the second runner-up?  Here it is.  It's a big fucking...  Or is that our son?  It might be our son or it was a son.  It's probably our son, because that doesn't even seem that fucking big.  I wish I could find that.  We'll be right back with more vague space knowledge. 
[00:07:30]  That's a line in The Great Tom Papa.  All right.  The first, the number one, the line that almost made line of the day.  Let's go to the first runner-up.  I'll just say it.  Okay.  Because this is only going to end bad.  I just couldn't come with her.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  You're such an idiot.  Which was the line of the day?  You're such an idiot.  Oh.  Now, how do you feel about that, Sal?  You helped get a line of the day on the table. 
[00:08:00]  You're such an idiot.  Oh, I'm happy.  Way to go.  Yeah.  And it was a fun segment to do.  You like that segment?  Yeah.  It was fucking awesome radio.  Did you get humiliated by it?  Every second I was standing here.  All right.  Good.  Good.  All right.  Then let us hear today's line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[00:08:30]  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  What did she not do that you needed?  Ah.  There's something she wasn't doing that he needed.  I like a little ass play.  That's pretty much it.  Oh.  Jesus.  Oh.  Let's go with that.  Yo, nigga.  What up?  You won, Sal.  Yes.  Congratulations.  Yes.  Sal got line of the day.  Oh, I'm so happy.  I didn't even know what you were saying in that segment.  First, you come off and saying, I didn't come with the girl.  And then he says, I mean, you're just hearing the clips now, Roland. 
[00:09:00]  So you're just starting to put the pieces together.  They're like, because we had to press him a little bit.  Because obviously, Sal was very embarrassed to give most of these details out.  He goes, well, why couldn't you come with that girl?  She's a hot girl.  You're 22 years old.  You should be coming now.  Of course.  You should be coming as you walk down the street.  He goes, I need a little ass play.  Let's hear the line again.  This was the response to them saying, why couldn't you come? 
[00:09:30]  I guess it looks creepy if he does ask that new girl for ass play with a mustache.  Maybe that's what it is.  We were all kind of suspect and wondering, like, all right, Sal can't get off with a girl.  He says he's not gay.  Here was his response to, what do you need to come?  What did she not do that you needed?  There's something she wasn't doing that he needed.  I like a little ass play.  Oh!  And we're just sitting there going, Sal, you're making it easy for us now. 
[00:10:00]  I know it was easy, but, I mean, Jim is fucking awesome.  Jim was able to just pinpoint everything.  How was that?  Just, he was able to ask the exact questions at the right time to get the best answers out of me.  It was fucking awesome.  I guess.  Now you're being self-analytical.  I'm being self-analytical.  You're just a creep.  You're a weird guy.  I don't know.  Maybe I am, Sam.  You are.  Maybe I am.  You're very strange.  Your motivations for things are completely unclear.  I mean, just down to the mustache.  Yeah.  They asked you to grow a mustache. 
[00:10:30]  You said no.  And then, like, a month later, you show up and you have a mustache.  None of it makes any sense.  Well, I don't know.  I was just giving it a try now, and I...  It works and it doesn't work, I guess.  It doesn't work.  It just doesn't work.  I don't know what the work part is.  I don't know.  Yeah, it looks pretty stupid.  Very stupid.  Yeah.  But leave it.  Believe it?  Because now it's like a character thing.  Yeah, but this new hoe doesn't really like it that much.  Shave it, though.  Shave it?  Shave it.  Yeah.  I have another line from the Sal segment.  Ooh!  I didn't cut, but I didn't use if you want to hear it. 
[00:11:00]  Sal, you loved...  I mean, Eric, you loved the Sal segment.  It was very entertaining.  You enjoyed seeing Sal get thrown under the bar.  He came.  It was informative.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Eric, you didn't have any trouble coming during that segment.  Not at all.  No.  You could have put three condoms on.  You would have been fine.  Here's another clip.  Her genitals are internal.  Oh, right.  I was like, where is this?  Ew.  I can't sword fight with this.  You were pushing the belly button, hoping the genitals would pop out?  Did you ever try that?  Push the belly button to see if a penis would come out?  No.  You didn't try it once? 
[00:11:30]  No.  Okay.  I didn't know how much you knew about human physiology.  No.  I'm not going to take things for granted.  Let's go to 920.  920, you're on After Opin Anthony Live.  Hey, dogs.  I don't like Sal anymore, but I have a lot more respect for him, because just like everybody  on the show, and all of the listeners, he can only have sex with women he doesn't respect.  Is that what it was, Sal?  Did you have too much respect for this girl?  I do.  I still do.  I still have a lot of respect.  Well, she doesn't have much respect for you. 
[00:12:00]  Not at all.  You can't even come.  None whatsoever.  Do you ever, so do you have an easier time jizzing when you have respect for the girl?  When you don't have respect for the girl, I should say?  I don't know.  I've never really considered it.  You have to objectify these women?  Make them objects?  Yeah.  I, I, yeah, I guess, maybe.  Like, just treating them like shit?  I don't know.  I can't really treat a woman like shit.  Why not?  I don't know.  That's not cool.  Because you relate to them?  No, Sal.  Because you're very feminine yourself?  I'm not very feminine myself.  You don't think you're a bit feminine?  No.  You honestly don't think you're feminine? 
[00:12:30]  No.  Roland, do you think Sal's feminine?  A bit.  I mean.  He's a bit feminine.  A poquito.  A poquito, right?  How am I feminine?  You have a Chandler Bean Sweatnotch, like that sweatshirt thing on.  I have no idea what you just said.  Chandler Bean Sweatnotch.  One more time.  I don't know.  One more time.  I guess a guy from Friends wore a sweater like that?  Yeah.  Maybe.  But he was a heterosexual male.  So I don't know why that goes.  No, there was a question, Chandler.  Oh, did they?  Yeah.  Oh.  Eric, do you think Sal's a bit feminine? 
[00:13:00]  He has some tendencies.  He has some, right?  What are my tendencies?  You were the one this morning.  You were the one this morning.  You were the one around with your hands a lot.  Okay, so I'm Italian.  What am I going to do?  You were the one this morning, Eric, who goes, Eric, you go, hey, you've been dressing  a lot nicer lately.  I'm like, what the fuck are you joking about?  Compliment his wardrobe, Eric?  Well, it's becoming very noticeable that he's really been changing his wardrobe up  so that it would be noticed.  Get a call, Sal.  Eric, what's wrong?  You have been changing your wardrobe up.  I mean, you have been dressing a little more, I don't know, you've been wearing your little 
[00:13:30]  cardigans and stuff to work.  Yeah.  I wore the green cords the other day.  Why?  Because they're fucking cool.  I don't know.  I disagree.  Most people would.  Yeah.  Because I just stopped caring.  There's some part of me that...  No, you care more.  You're wearing three shirts.  A person who doesn't care.  That was the Troy defense.  Yeah, that's bullshit.  Yeah.  If you don't care, you're not wearing three shirts and making sure they match.  I absolutely care about how you present yourself.  It's very, very important.  You care how I present myself?  How everybody presents themselves.  Oh, oh.  Sorry.  How am I doing?  It was a have and have.  How am I doing?  So now you're doing great.  Thank you. 
[00:14:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay, good.  I think it's very important how you dress, but there's certain things that I just wouldn't  wear to work because I know I would get made fun of or whatever.  There's worse clothes?  You have worse clothes?  No, probably the green cords are the most ridiculous.  What would you not wear to work?  I don't know.  Probably some stupid graphic tees that I have or something like that.  I don't know.  That's all any of us wear, though.  Yeah, I know.  But like I'm saying, it's very important how you present yourself.  Therefore, I think you have to be comfortable.  So, like, I'm just going to dress more comfortable and not care what people say. 
[00:14:30]  Like, oh, that shirt's stupid or whatever.  Because that's what you feel comfortable in.  Correct.  This is how I like to dress.  That's how I feel comfortable.  Regardless of whether you're going to make fun of me or not, I like Chandler Bing cardigans.  Yeah.  I like the way this shirt fits.  Yeah.  I'm going to wear this shirt.  Yes.  Okay, that's what you start caring about.  Judgments.  Right.  Because you care about fashion, but you don't care about people judging you for caring about  fashion. 
[00:15:00]  Why?  Correct?  Yes.  Because you said it very convolutedly, and I came to this aha moment.  Sorry.  You know?  Don't be sorry.  We figured it out together.  Very Oprah.  Was that Oprah?  Aha.  Yeah.  She does aha moments.  I know, but Oprah's aha moments.  She's like, aha, you were molested, and I figured it out.  We did it together.  Let's cry.  This is different aha.  Maybe it's the same one.  I don't know.  Maybe it's based in the same direction.  I was never molested.  That you can remember.  Nope, never.  That you can remember.  What do you mean by that I can remember?  A lot of people got molested and don't remember it. 
[00:15:30]  They block it out.  I definitely, I know.  Think about it.  All right.  Let's think together.  Okay.  All right.  Sit there and think very hard.  Yeah.  All right.  Really rack your brain until you almost have a headache.  Okay.  No, I was never molested.  All right.  You thought about it hard?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  I'll take your word for that.  Do you talk to women?  All the time.  You ask them questions?  Sure.  Have you ever asked a woman what the best gift that she ever got was?  Not me inside of her.  No, of course not. 
[00:16:00]  Because there's no payoff.  There is nothing that's going to happen after that.  Without question.  Without hesitation.  Without even thinking about it.  That woman always says her engagement ring, Sal.  It's so...  I see where you went with this.  It's so important.  It's not just a ring.  It's not just a sign of affection.  It's everything to her.  I mean, an engagement ring would probably mean more to a woman than you reaching climax, Sal.  Absolutely.  And that's a very rare thing.  Absolutely.  Every time she washes her hands.  So when she goes to wash that Sal DNA off her hands... 
[00:16:30]  Or the Sal ass.  Right.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She'd have to wash her hands because they were in your bottom.  No, I don't like people touching my ass.  Well, that remains to be seen.  Every time someone at the store hands or change, you get the credit.  Every time she shows her friends, you get the credit.  You get credit for that ring every day.  So it's got to be perfect.  Steven Singer gets that.  At Steven Singer Jewelers, they have the perfect system to make sure you get the perfect ring.  Steven Singer knows how important it is, and he makes it painless.

Roland, did you learn anything? 
[00:17:30]  I know you didn't hear the whole show.  I learned a lot about Sal today.  Yeah, Sal, what did you learn?  Did you learn about yourself?  I did learn about myself.  I learned it.  I feel a lot better that I just came forth and just said it.  You just came out.  No, I didn't.  But, no, it feels good to just be truthful.  Now imagine if you took that to the next level.  That's all I'll say.  Just imagine.  No.  Eric, did you learn anything on today's show?  Just think about it.  Eric, did you learn?  Yeah, I learned Alex Jones had a lot of stats on mass murder pills.  Oh, my God. 
[00:18:00]  How great.  Did you see that, Roland?  How great was that episode of Piers Morgan last night?  We should have him tomorrow.  I could call him.  Alex Jones?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'd check with Opie and Anthony.  I would say in a heartbeat because he was fucking hilarious on Piers Morgan last night.  Did you see Dan Soder on Conan?  No.  Yes, very good.  He was awesome.  Was he good?  Yeah, his first appearance.  He was great in here the one time.  We've got to get him back in.  Yeah, I mean, he killed it on Conan.  Did he?  Yeah, and then tonight's Kimmel.  I'm so excited.  Did he do?  Not for Dan Soder.  No, no, no.  Yeah.  No, it was a good one.  It was Courtney Cox and Dan Soder. 
[00:18:30]  Did Soder do stand-up?  Yeah, stand-up.  And you did well?  Yeah.  You did well, Eric?  Yeah, you did very well.  It's up online, too, on Conan's website.  That's awesome.  Yeah, yeah.  Dan Soder's a great comedian.  He's been here once.  He does Bob Kelly's podcast with him.  I love his macho man.  He does maybe the best macho man, Randy Savage, there is.  You want to hear it?  Yeah, do you have it?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're listening to After Opie and Anthony Live  with the primetime kid himself, Sam Roberts.  Yeah, dig it!  It's like he's talking to me from the grave.  It's amazing. 
[00:19:00]  Speaking of wrestling, old wrestlers.  Miss Elizabeth.  Poor Miss Elizabeth.  The Superfly himself.  Jimmy Snuka.  As it stands, in studio tomorrow.  In the Opie and Anthony studio tomorrow.  I am pissed at you and Eric, though.  Why?  Because I started watching Raw.  Did you enjoy it last night?  Yeah.  It was good, right?  Yeah, it was the whole ladder match.  You were watching CM Punk's ladder match?  Yeah, I was like, why is he down?  Oh, he's climbing up.  That's true.  Roland sent out an email to everybody on the staff. 
[00:19:30]  I woke up to see it this morning, late last night, that said, why did CM Punk need the  shield to help him win that ladder match?  I was like, what?  Roland hates wrestling.  But Superfly will be in here tomorrow.  Are you excited about Superfly, Eric?  Yes, very much so.  Are you looking for the old Superfly stuff?  Yeah, I'm trying to find it.  In the meantime, oh, that reminds me, while I'm talking about that, you guys know JBL.  Yeah.  He has a website called Layfield Report.  It's layfieldreport.com.  All these wrestlers, they want to get out of the wrestling business so bad. 
[00:20:00]  He has delicious energy drinks.  They want to move into the mainstream.  Yeah, Layfield was doing the energy drinks for a while.  Wait, that wasn't an energy drink, though.  No, he did the energy drink, and then he did the other.  Slow your roll.  Right.  He did Mama Juana energy drink.  Oh, right, right, right, right.  And then he did the calm down drink, if you have too much Mama Juana.  But, yeah, he has a website called layfieldreport.com.  I think he's trying to launch it.  It's like a news website.  It's very Drudge Report, Huffington Post-E.  Well, he's on Fox News now and then. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, well, he's on Fox News every week.  He's a smart dude.  He's a Texas man.  He's on Fox News every week.  He's on Fox Business all the time.  Yeah, he's...  He's on with the guy from MASH.  Right.  He's a smart guy.  He's a very smart guy.  But I did a blog, and I think I'm going to do some more, for layfieldreport.com.  Check it out when you get a chance.  You should also mention the other thing you did.  Well, it's a pop culture blog.  It's not wrestling-related at all, so you guys can enjoy it.  If you go to layfieldreport.com, you can go.  It's in the first column.  It's like the third thing down.  I did it last night.  I wrote about Justin Bieber smoking pot and Johnny Football drinking and everybody making 
[00:21:00]  a huge deal out of this.  Like, you know, like a 20-year-old college athlete who's about to become a millionaire  has some champagne.  And this is a news story because he's not 21.  Whoa!  In college?  No, no, no.  But he made college millions of dollars.  Yeah, and like an 18-year-old who has money like Justin Bieber, and he's smoking pot.  Like, Leif Garrett used to get busted for heroin, and we have to hear about Justin Bieber  smoking pot.  It's not a story.  Didn't Partridge family, like, fuck each other and do cocaine and all that craziness? 
[00:21:30]  Danny Bonaduce.  Yeah, I think they did.  I think he's right, Eric.  I'm going to throw an alleged after that.  No, we're all just asking the question, and I think that's probably right.  I think they did.  Mrs. Brady and all the stories.  Is that the Eat True Hollywood?  That was the Brady Bunch.  Oh, Brady Bunch, I'm sorry.  I think the Partridge family probably all got on that bus, did a bunch of coke, and fucked  each other.  Probably.  I think they probably did.  I get those two shows confused.  We don't have proof of that.  The Brady Bunch probably did it in the station wagon.  They all did it. 
[00:22:00]  Probably.  I think.  Yeah, maybe.  But now they're just making up stories.  So that's what the blog's about.  Go check it out.  I was talking about the other thing you did.  Over at the video.  Check it out at layfeelreport.com.  Oh, yeah, the video's old, though, now.  I don't think you talked about it, though.  Did a JBL and Cole show on YouTube.  If you go to YouTube and look up JBL and Cole show.  It's a pretty big deal.  Yeah.  I had a video that it was a DWE logo in the corner.  Watch out.  You're doing JBL, trying to leave.  I like it.  You're teaming up with the right people.  I'm not going to comment on that, but I will say, I've always known you to be perceptive. 
[00:22:30]  Let's go to 352.  Hey, the great Sam Roberts.  What's up?  You know, not only can you get all your good weekend info on at not Sam on Twitter, but  you can also see the celebrity accolades that you get from celebrities, like the great Michael  Cole.  Yeah, I guess Michael Cole has some kind of vested interest in this Layfield report,  because I'm getting tweets from JBL. 
[00:23:00]  I'm getting tweets from Michael Cole, the IWE's big announcer.  Does it make you jealous, Eric, when all these wrestling guys are like, hey, it's my buddy,  Sam, on the website.  Check it out.  No, I think it's awesome.  I didn't ask you, Roland.  Of course you think it's awesome.  Why would you get jealous?  I don't care.  You could give a shit.  I don't give a fuck.  Have you read the blog?  I don't read it.  Of course you haven't.  But I'll read it for you, though.  I know you will.  Does it make you a little jealous, Eric?  I see photos.  I'm like, hey, I wasn't invited to dinner.  He does get jealous.  Going out.  He does.  In the office, he goes, ah, ah. 
[00:23:30]  You see a tweet that goes out last night, and it's Michael Cole.  That's a picture of you and him.  Michael Cole is the IWE's lead announcer, all right?  He has wrestled a match at WrestleMania.  As far as announcers go, in 2013, he's 1-0.  It gets no bigger than Michael Cole.  And Michael Cole is tweeting out, hey, my buddy at NotSam has a new blog over at LayfieldReport.com.  Does that get under your skin a little bit?  He said, my buddy, NotSam, and then he plugged my blog.  No, that doesn't get under my skin, but I'm just like, you know.  Do you think?  Yeah, you're going, I'd like a little of that love over here, over in the E-Rock radio camp. 
[00:24:00]  Do you think he'll get jealous when Michael and I hang out this summer?  When Michael, oh, when you and Michael Cole and me?  The three of us?  Yeah.  Don't tell him about that yet.  Oh, okay.  I'm just kidding, Eric.  Don't get all worked out.  Six months back.  Hey, Sam, I got a one that I learned today.  Oh, what did you learn?  I learned that fucking Sal was obsessed with saying how honest he was being during that fucking segment.  It was annoying the living shit out of me.  And he keeps saying it now, too, right? 
[00:24:30]  I got it off my chest.  I got everything I needed to say.  I was honest.  So honest.  What are you, douchebag?  He said he learned that you're fucking annoying because you mentioned about 400 times that you were being honest.  I'm just going to be honest here.  I'll be honest.  I'll be honest.  Okay.  Eric, do you think we could put together an I'll be honest montage from Sal?  Or a drinking game?  Yeah.  I don't have the time to go through all of that.  You're fucking hammered, Roland.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Do we have a little Superfly?  Yes, we do.  Superfly is going to be back tomorrow.  I'm excited. 
[00:25:00]  If Superfly could read, I'll bet he would be at LayfieldsReport.com.  Looking at my blog.  You don't have to look at everything on the website.  Just look at my one blog.  It's like 400 words.  Or why don't you get a few minutes before or after for your blog with Superfly?  Oh, that's taken care of, Roland.  You don't need to worry about that.  All right.  Go ahead.  This is the last time Superfly was in.  It was how many years ago, Eric?  That'd be excellent.  I think 99, 2000, somewhere in there.  Yeah, before XM.  Yeah.  So you're talking about probably 12 to 13 years since we've talked to Superfly Jimmy Snuka. 
[00:25:30]  And he was another guest that Opie and Anthony had on because he was falling apart.  Like Buddy Epson.  Yeah.  Who actually died.  But Jimmy Snuka.  But not when they were trying to get him to die.  I don't know if they were actively trying.  They were.  They were pursuing it.  They kept calling him like twice a month.  To find out if he was dead yet.  Because they wanted the last interview.  Well, Superfly was a wreck when Opie and Anthony talked to him like 12 or 13 years ago. 
[00:26:00]  He's going to be back in tomorrow.  He's got a book out.  Here's what he sounded like 12 or 13 years ago.  Okay, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  This is a Superfly Jimmy Snuka and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  It's a Superfly Jimmy Snuka and you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Superfly Jimmy Snuka on your radio doll.  Tell Troy to get his ass back to work, quote-unquote sick ass, back to work tomorrow 
[00:26:30]  so he can get some Superfly Jimmy Snooker drops.  Yeah, his hair's sick, too.  We need to compare and contrast.  661.  Yeah, I want to know what the hell happened with Martha's radio studio.  I don't get up early enough.  I'm on the West Coast.  Well, I'll tell you.  Can I go put all that shit over there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There are signs on the wall.  Apparently somebody got pissed off.  I don't know.  But I think at some point this morning, we put up the signs that we talked about yesterday. 
[00:27:00]  I don't know if they're still there.  That remains to be seen.  But they were very offensive signs, so I would think that they wouldn't stay there very long.  Well, I guess we'll have to wait and see.  We'll put them up.  But the Martha Stewart wall may or may not.  Who put the signs?  I don't know.  I think Sal.  Oh, okay.  Right?  Oh, Sal doesn't want to say anything.  I'm sorry.  What did you say?  Sal was getting mad.  I said that you put up the signs on the Martha studio.  Anyway, the soon-to-be Opie and Anthony studio.  I'll put up the signs. 
[00:27:30]  We will be back, I guess, on Thursday with the after show, because tomorrow is the advice show.  But stay tuned.  Ryan Fez are next.  Jimmy Snuka on Opie and Anthony tomorrow.  And David and Anthony Friday.  I'm excited about Jimmy Snuka.  David and Anthony.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ryan Fez are next.  Hey.  Hey.
