<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with technical difficulties and banter about the intro music.  They then announced Mickey Ward, the boxer from *The Fighter*, as a future guest.  A discussion ensued comparing Lowell and South Boston, followed by a *Real Sports* clip showcasing Mickey Ward's nephew, Ray, who has cerebral palsy and is boxing.  The hosts commented on Larry Merchant's interviewing style and the Ward family's challenges.  The conversation segued into *The Fighter*, Christian Bale's performance, and various Batman films, including clips from *Batman Returns*, and critiques of the various actors portraying Batman (Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney) and Jack Nicholson as the Joker.

A surprising anecdote followed about a positive experience with a Hasidic Jew who fixed their air conditioning, contrasting with their usual negative experiences with service providers. This led to a discussion of B&H Photo's excellent customer service, contrasted with Apple and Best Buy.  A caller, Travis, shared a negative experience with a Hasidic Jew.  A brief, unrelated discussion about a comedian's masturbation joke involving "The Wiz" record store also occurred.

The show then focused on viral videos of Russian daredevils performing death-defying stunts on skyscrapers and bridges.  The hosts and Sam (a producer/board operator) reacted with a mix of shock, disbelief, and humor.  This led to a reflection on childhood tree forts and bird-related myths, contrasting with the Russian daredevils' feats. The hosts also briefly discussed biking, Opie's air conditioning problems, and their fatigue before moving into the next segment.

The next segment started with a discussion of childhood myths and rules, like not touching birds or praying mantises.  This transitioned into a humorous critique of cyclists in Central Park and their attire, specifically focusing on their tight spandex shorts.  A video of child abuse was shown, eliciting disgust and anger from the hosts. Viewer-submitted anecdotes about childhood rules and misconceptions followed, including one about a pet raccoon.  A call-in segment featured listeners sharing childhood stories. The hosts then discussed their experiences with interns and their thoughts on hazing.  Finally, they debated the similarities between Lady Gaga's "Born This Way" and Madonna's "Express Yourself."  Mickey Ward was again mentioned as an upcoming guest.

The following segment heavily featured music discussions, focusing on Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga (and accusations of her plagiarizing Madonna), and Bob Dylan's Medal of Freedom ceremony, including several video clips. A caller further fueled the Gaga/Madonna plagiarism debate, extending the discussion to Led Zeppelin's alleged plagiarism.  Donald Trump's questioning of Obama's birthplace and a documentary about Trump and his son were also discussed.  Ice-T's new documentary, "The Art of Rap," was a major topic, especially after one of the hosts spoke with Ice-T earlier.  The segment concluded with a lengthy discussion about the "Hatfields & McCoys" miniseries and a surprising anecdote about a 1979 *Family Feud* episode featuring actual Hatfields and McCoys, along with guns and a pig.  Significant profanity and a brief, highly vulgar argument between two hosts occurred. Ice-T was present in the studio but mostly silent.

The next portion began with a news story about a man attacking police after self-harm.  The hosts transitioned to rumors, specifically focusing on Roland and Nagel as sources. The content of the rumor remained undisclosed.  A large portion focused on one host's (Eric) Lego collection, specifically the Millennium Falcon and a potential purchase of a massive Taj Mahal Lego set.

Ice-T then joined the show to discuss his documentary, *The Art of Rap*.  He detailed the challenges of making the film, including scheduling various artists and highlighting the artistry of rap.  The conversation covered hip-hop history, the East Coast/West Coast rivalry, Ice-T's experiences, and his views on rap's evolution. Mickey Ward briefly appeared at the end of this segment.

Finally, Mickey Ward's interview took place. He discussed *The Fighter*'s production, Christian Bale's method acting (which reportedly drove his wife crazy), his boxing career, his relationship with his brother Dickie Eklund, and his relationship with Chuck Wepner and Mike Tyson, including speculation about Wepner's death. He spoke about his post-boxing life, his boxing gym, his fitness routine, his nephew Ray's boxing success, and his family, including his mother's personality, his brother Max's recovery, and his aggressive driving habits.  He concluded by promoting his autobiography, *The Warrior's Heart*, and a book signing.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, and welcome aboard.  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Does that sound low in the mix?  I don't know.  The whole reason for this music is urgency.  Yeah.  So when you have it really low in the mix, E-Rock, it doesn't work at all.  You know that, right? After all these years.  But E-Rock's petrified that you're going to go, 
[00:00:30]  E-Rock, we're trying to talk. Turn that down.  Well, it's supposed to start way up high.  If you really want to get into radio for a second.  And then you pull it down.  You establish it. It's called establishing.  Shirtless guys on PalTalk get bounced.  Bye.  Like a sit and look at shirtless men.  What are you, a queer?  Yeah, exactly.  No, meaning you. What's wrong with you?  Oh, right.  Oh, good morning.  Good morning, good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  We're going to have Mickey Ward in today. 
[00:01:00]  I'm fucking psyched.  Yeah, me too, man.  Mark Wahlberg played him in The Fighter.  That guy from Lowell, Massachusetts.  I wonder if he knows my relatives.  Oh, yeah?  I got some whack jobs up there.  You got some people up there in Lowell?  Oh, I don't know their names and I don't know where they live,  but I got relatives up there.  Lowell is always a very blue-collar area when we used to go up there.  Is that Southie?  No.  Lowell is north.  Let me do this for you.  Northwest of Boston.  Yes. 
[00:01:30]  What is Southie?  Where is Southie?  Southie is southeast of Boston.  Believe it or not, east a little bit, too.  Well, that's what the east stands for in Southie.  Southeast.  Southie, yeah.  I wanted to go to Southie when I was up there in Boston.  I didn't make it over there.  It's kind of hard to get to.  Yeah.  And I think it's done that way on purpose.  They don't want anyone around there.  Yeah, yeah.  They just leave us alone.  Leave us to ourselves.  We know what we're doing with this area.  Yeah.  No need for you to come by and say hi.  Yeah.  We got this. 
[00:02:00]  We did a few shows in Lowell back in the day.  Yeah.  Is it a tough area?  Quite the crowd.  Supposedly it's turning around a little bit,  according to Bryant Cumble and his, what is that,  Real Sports or whatever, HBO Real fucking whatever the show.  Yeah, whatever the fuck that is.  I should ask him next time I'm in the elevator with that grump.  Oh, really?  Lives in my building.  A bit of a grump.  Your star-studded building.  Oh, this guy.  Yeah.  HBO Real Sports with Bryant Cumble.  You got Ray, who's Mickey Ward's brother. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  I want to ask Mickey Ward about this.  This was actually a great episode of Real Sports with Bryant Cumble.  I wanted to be a boxer since I was a kid,  to follow in the footsteps of my uncle, Mickey.  Oh, it's an uncle.  I'm sorry.  Because that's what this family has known.  That's what we grew up in.  Like, I started watching fights with my grandfather  when I was just five or six years old.  Around the house, not on TV.  They were there, too. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  This is going to take forever.  I thought it was a nice preview clip.  No, it's the actual thing, I think.  Oh, really?  What's wrong with the kid?  Because there's something wrong with the kid.  Cerebral palsy?  Yeah.  And for most of his life, he hasn't walked.  Yeah.  And then out of nowhere, he's starting to walk and train.  Yeah, he gets in the ring, starts sparring.  They're starting to say it's a bit of a miracle  that he's able to kind of spar a little bit and walk around.  You know, he's not going to have any real fights or anything like that,  but he's able to train now. 
[00:03:30]  That's a tough fucking family, man.  Oh, yeah.  Who's the old guy doing the interview?  What's his name again?  Larry Merchant?  Yeah.  He's been around forever.  He looks hilarious.  That's the one Jay Moore does perfectly.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  He just looks like some old dude hanging out.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, he's very chill with his interviewing style.  Yes, yes, he is.  So, Mickey Ward will be in at 9 o'clock today.  What is he promoting?  His book.  It's called...  A Warrior's Heart, right?  Yeah, and it's...  I knew the answer.  I was just saying for the audience. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, Warrior's Heart.  It is out, I think...  What's today?  Tuesday?  Wednesday.  It was out yesterday.  Oh, nice.  And I've been watching some of his clips on YouTube.  His Arturo...  I'd like to hear his feelings on Arturo Gatti, who looks like murdered by his fucking wife.  Right.  Damn.  Very interesting guy, man.  Yeah, absolutely.  I have not read the whole book, but I flipped through it.  And what a heavy fucking...  A lot of stuff that family's had to deal with.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  The brother, Dick Yecklin, you know, how drugs...  After the Sugar Ray fight, he said that should have propelled him, but he just... 
[00:04:30]  Right.  Fucking after that, he just went down the tubes.  Lowell's a tough, tough area.  It is, right?  A lot of drugs up there.  So, supposedly it's getting a little better, but there's still a lot of utes with problems.  How good was Christian Bale in that movie, man?  Holy shit.  Amazing.  He didn't talk like this.  I didn't like him in Batman.  I don't like the choice he made.  I never know.  But he's a great actor, man.  He is really a good actor.  He's been in some really...  He wasn't even that bad in Batman. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, he really wasn't that bad.  I just didn't like what he did with the superhero voice.  It was just a choice he made.  I still think the prestige was great.  But I think they fucked that up by fucking around with the voice afterwards, too.  Did they?  It sounded like it, yeah.  Yeah.  Like they ran it through some filters or something.  Oh, maybe they did.  So, I don't know.  Where is she?  I'm Bat Guy.  Hey, Commissioner Gordon.  Yeah, hey, you.  What?  Give me the bat hats.  What?  Bat hats.  So, who's now playing Batman? 
[00:05:30]  He is.  He's still playing Batman.  Oh, all right.  So, what are they doing?  This is the last one.  What do you mean it's the last one?  Yeah.  Then they got to reboot again.  Right.  Is he going to die?  No, it's just the last one in the Dark Knight trilogy.  So, if it's the last one, kill him off.  And then we start over.  Reinventing the story.  I'm sick of this shit.  Just kill these people off.  I want Michael Keaton again as Batman.  Oh, my God.  Imagine they just go back around.  We get Michael Keaton.  He's a little old fat.  You know how silly Michael Keaton's Batman looks now? 
[00:06:00]  I do.  Can we see some of that?  Oh, my God.  It is pretty silly.  Well, they went with cartoon.  Cartoon-ish.  And Clooney, too.  And Clooney.  You forget Clooney was Batman.  Clooney was Batman.  They should have killed all these Batman.  Clooney was Batman.  Why not?  Was that Kilmer Batman?  Yes.  Val Kilmer was Batman.  Everyone was Batman.  Who did he play Batman?  Which one did he play Batman in?  It was Michael Keaton for the first two.  And then Val Kilmer and George Clooney.  Or it might be those two reversed.  But that was the four.  Well, I don't forget about Adam West.  Well, Adam West was not the original.  As far as. 
[00:06:30]  And Mr. Freeze.  Oh, is he terrible?  Was he bad?  Yeah.  He was supposed to be, though.  That was all supposed to be cartoony back then.  And then they went with the reboot to make it really dark.  To make it dark, yeah.  Which was a great move.  Jack Nicholson was good as the Joker.  He was, even though he led you to straight that.  Oh, really?  Yeah, exactly.  But he was good, though, Nicholson.  This was 89?  Yeah.  They say he can't be killed.  They say he drinks blood.  Is there a six-foot bat in Gotham City?  God. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, I like him.  Robert Woolf.  Mickey Dale.  Who's mine?  And what do you do for a living?  I've got that.  That was Kim Basinger.  Yes.  This seemed like the beginning of an era for these kind of movies, though, right?  In a city without me, your luck is about to change.  This is definitely kind of dark, though.  Yeah.  I love this movie.  This wasn't terrible.  No.  You mean freak terrorizes?  Wait till they get a load of me.  It's out there right now.  Fucking Jack. 
[00:07:30]  I've got to go to work.  All right.  We're just watching trailers.  Batman Returns is worse.  This wasn't a terrible, terrible thing.  And didn't it seem like this style of movies in the 90s was kind of starting right here?  Yeah.  None of these movies were bad.  Right.  Well, this one was pretty good.  And it was darker than...  Right.  Everyone remembered Batman as being Batman, Batman, and then this came out and I was like,  holy fuck.  This was very well received when it came out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you remember, all the brothers were wearing Batman shirts.  Were they?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I had one.  The brothers loved fucking Batman. 
[00:08:00]  Because Batman wasn't black.  Like, he wasn't wearing an all black suit before this.  Yeah.  They still love the Batman shirts.  Oh, they love the Batman shirts.  I still see the Batman shirts here and there.  But Tim Burton said doing Batman Returns, like, after he did that, he will never do another  sequel to a movie.  Oh, really?  He hated it.  Oh, fuck Tim Burton.  Yeah.  So instead he puts out Dark Shadows?  He puts out the same movie.  Exactly.  He just casts Johnny Depp in it.  Exactly.  Johnny Depp, can we get you to do this?  Put some makeup on.  What's the obsession with...  Yeah, put some makeup on.  What's the obsession with Johnny Depp? 
[00:08:30]  He loves him so much.  He loves him.  He has to put him in every movie.  And that broad, too.  His wife.  And what's her name?  That broad.  She makes good faces.  Yeah.  Oh.  What the hell's her name?  Carter.  Helena Bonham Carter.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That broad.  I just want to say quickly that I love the Hasidic Jews.  I'm a big fan.  Yeah?  Really?  I'm a huge fan of the Hasidic Jews.  Yesterday I was telling you about the air conditioning.  I got six huge AC units and three are out. 
[00:09:00]  And I was told that the AC units need to be replaced.  What?  Replaced?  Or just the filters?  Replaced.  Taken out, brand new units put in.  That makes no sense.  Thank you.  And that's why I love the Hasidic Jews.  What'd they do?  We looked up a guy.  He comes over.  We were very surprised what he looked like, to be completely honest with you.  I was expecting some kind of, like, blue collar.  Some guy.  Yeah.  You know. 
[00:09:30]  Showing.  Exactly.  Cover rolls.  This guy was dressed like he was going to church.  Or wherever they go.  The temple or whatever.  Yeah?  Did he have pay us?  Oh, yeah.  He had pay us.  No, they had to pay him.  Double gun.  Nice one.  Go ahead.  That was a double gun.  He had the pay us.  He had the very long pay us, because he's been around a while.  Oh, okay.  With the shaved head.  Oh, wow.  And he had a little hat.  He had the little yarmulke or the...  He had the hat.  The hat hat.  He had the I'm working hat, I guess.  Oh, man.  I guess there's a I'm working hat, but you could tell him...  Was it that Amish looking hat? 
[00:10:00]  Yes.  Oh, man.  But I guess this is the work hat.  A little smaller on the brim.  A little smaller.  That's good.  But definitely, it was definitely the hat.  And he walks in, and I'm like, oh, all right.  Whoa.  So I shake his hand.  I'm like, nice to meet you.  And then...  Nice to meet you!  And then my wife puts out her hand, and he refuses to shake her hand.  Oh, wow.  He is hardcore to say.  What did he say?  He was very pleasant, though.  He kind of gave a little bow.  I don't know.  There's a move where, I guess when you're not supposed to shake the hand, he puts his 
[00:10:30]  hands to his chest and kind of went like this.  Just a little bow-y thing.  A slight little bow, like, nice to meet you.  Like, ah, they don't understand our fucking traditions.  You women are fucking pieces of shit in our eyes.  Exactly.  It was a slight bow to, like, the right, just a little off.  Wow, that's fucked up.  And then he comes in, and he digs in.  Yeah?  I go, yeah, these two units need to be replaced.  He goes, why?  I go, well...  Exactly.  I was told.  I was told.  He goes, let me look.  And he looks. 
[00:11:00]  He goes, these don't need to be replaced.  They just need to be steam cleaned.  Ah, same.  But he could have went with it.  Yeah.  Because I offered up that these units need to be replaced.  He could have fucking taken advantage and taken the job.  Was the coil clogged?  Coil's clogged, yeah.  Ah, shit.  Is that what it was?  Cleaned the filters.  Yeah.  And then it freezes over.  He goes, when was the last time these things were serviced?  I said, I don't know.  I've been there four years.  Oy vey.  He goes, ah, these things need to be serviced every year or two. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  So I love the Hasidic Jews because they're very honest people.  Is it working now?  This guy could have ripped me off.  Is it working now?  No, he's got to take the two out.  But he got one to work a little better than it was.  Oy.  So, yeah.  And, you know, we love the B&H, and that's all Hasidic Jews, too.  Great.  Very knowledgeable guys when it comes to their business.  Something is going on with these guys.  They're like honest businessmen or something.  I felt like I was in good hands.  Ah, see?  You feel like they're very informed.  Whenever I deal with Hasidic Jews as a group, I always feel like whoever I'm dealing with 
[00:12:00]  is very informed.  Right.  Has done their whole...  It's like I always feel like I'm dealing with a professional.  Maybe it's just the way they conduct themselves, but I love dealing with them.  Well, I'm two for two, man.  I get my video shit from B&H, the Hasidic Jew place down there on what?  Where is it about?  34th and 9th.  Yeah.  Down by the tunnel.  And now I got an AC guy that's a Hasidic Jew.  It's great, right?  Yeah.  It's a long pace and everything.  We have to clean this?  I was going to say Jesus or God, just because that's what you do when you're talking. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And I had to be very aware.  Oh.  Very aware.  I'm sure he understands.  Travis, what's the matter?  You have something on the Hasidic Jew?  We know your mom ran off with a Jew.  Yeah, that's why I'm in here.  Sure.  Why are you here?  To report how their penis tastes on the cheek of a mother when you give her a kiss?  Hello?  I'm sorry, Travis.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  I apologize.  Travis's mother ran off with a Hasidic Jew years ago and has written off her whole fire 
[00:13:00]  life.  Yes.  Makes me very angry for Travis.  I know.  It's okay.  And I miss Nitro.  Yeah, and I miss Nitro.  Thanks, Sam.  You were talking about how they always seem very informed, and I was talking to the guy  last time I bought a camera from them, and he said that every new product release, they  go through three hours of training so that they know every product inside and out.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And you can tell.  And you're right.  They'll never try to upsell you there.  Like, I've been told time and again, no, you don't need that.  You need this.  This is cheaper.  Take this.  And you know what?  It goes a long way. 
[00:13:30]  It's great.  I don't...  Some of these guys want to go for the quick little, I'm going to make a few bucks off this loser  because he doesn't know what he's doing, meaning myself and the AC units, but he's  like, no.  No, that's why they're so successful.  Right.  Because they're just...  And you're right with B&H.  They never try to sell you something else.  Never.  And they own every camera.  They know everything about.  They're very organized.  It's theft-proof.  It's a great store.  Right.  That entire thing cost $3 million.  Did it really?  Yeah.  What?  The conveyor belt thing?  Yeah.  Their entire system.  You get a receipt. 
[00:14:00]  You go up to the frigging checkout thing.  You pay for it.  And then everything comes down on a conveyor belt.  That alone is just worth going, just to buy something and see how it works.  And watch it.  Yeah.  Yeah, for the people that don't know B&H, they have no product on the floor, which is very  smart.  I don't know where they learned that type of efficiency.  And they also know to hire black security guys.  Yes.  And they don't, you know...  They know what people are afraid of.  Yeah, exactly.  They're really smart.  But I got lazy once. 
[00:14:30]  I'm like, you know, I don't feel like going down to B&H.  So I went to the, you know, the Best Buy.  Oh, no.  All it took was going back to Best Buy one time.  Once.  Nope.  You got some snot-nosed fucking asshole who doesn't want to be there.  I understand.  We all had jobs we didn't want to be at.  Yeah.  You know, he's like, oh, I have to help you.  And he gives you an attitude and sighs real loud.  I'm like, you know what?  That's if you find somebody to help you.  Exactly.  You stand there for fucking an hour.  That's not my department.  Looking around, excuse me, could you...  Because most people in that situation, they're going to hide most of the time. 
[00:15:00]  They're going to go down some of those aisles and make believe they're busy.  Because they don't want to help anyone.  I wouldn't want to help anyone if I had that gig.  Yeah.  So, fuck that.  I went right back to B&H.  Somebody's suggesting The Wiz.  The Wiz.  Oh, my God.  The Wiz.  Nobody beats me.  Nobody beats me.  I'm the Wiz.  Wait, who did the joke?  What comedian did the joke?  Nobody beats The Wiz.  I beat The Wiz a few times a week.  It was a masturbation joke.  It was not a great one.  Oh, my God, Joe.  It's not a great one.  The Wiz.  The Wiz. 
[00:15:30]  Nobody beats me.  The guy who...  Crazy Eddie beats The Wiz.  Oh, man.  Nobody beats The Wiz.  Nobody beats The Wiz.  Remember The Wiz?  And then The Wiz just...  I love The Wiz because they had...  Wiz.  Wow.  They had the Billboard 200, like, on a wall.  So, like, literally every...  All 200 CDs were there.  Number one, number two, number three, number four.  So you could go there every week, and they would change it.  Every week, and you would know, like, what's...  What's big.  Yeah.  When did that shut down, that store?  It just fucking...  One day, they were done.  Yeah. 
[00:16:00]  It was some kind of misappropriation.  Oh, really?  Going on.  Oh, yeah.  Not as bad as Crazy Eddie Anter, but...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Eddie Anter was great.  There's only two places I like shopping, and that's the Apple Store and being...  That is fucking it.  And some of these other companies should wake up and realize what's going on in those two  stores.  Yeah.  Customer service really does go...  Fucking Apple, you walk in, you get attacked by somebody that wants to help you immediately.  And both stores look different.  Both stores look different than other stores. 
[00:16:30]  There's a weird feeling in there that you don't feel in other stores.  Yeah.  You feel like you're in good hands.  You're in first class.  That's right.  The guy who did these lights was a...  He's a B&H light guy.  Yeah.  And I've never seen a guy that knows more about...  That's stupid fucking lights, right?  Just to be fair, Danny C. in Long Island, Hasidic Jews are the most corrupt and filthy  humans in the city.  Fuck them.  All right.  They are sucking the city dry.  Oh, boy.  They are scamming the system in the worst way.  That's why I love reading some of these dumb things.  Why, Danny? 
[00:17:00]  Exactly, Danny.  If you're going to say all that, you've got to say why.  Danny Gerbils?  Who's that?  That's just broad stroke shit.  Why?  Just a guy who irrationally hates Jews.  Yeah.  Fair enough.  They think they all the time.  They just say, I hate Jews.  I get letters mailed to my house from some guy, and it's like handwritten and like printer  things of faces of Jewish businessmen and little notes written on them and shit about the Jews  and how they're ruining everything. 
[00:17:30]  I'm like, that's this guy's fucking hoot.  And they're mailed to my house.  That's crazy.  Yeah, I'm mailing myself letters.  Did you hear about the baseball player?  I think, of course, it's page eight, a black baseball player who's got a hate crime against  these.  He's a fucking tiger.  Dumb and young.  I had never heard the story where he was beating up yelling fucking Jews while randomly  attacking a slight built male tourist in Midtown earlier.  Wow.  And they won't plea with him.  Prosecutors are not pleaing with him, which I love.  Good.  Yeah, good. 
[00:18:00]  But it's on page eight.  On page nine.  That means he's not a great baseball player.  Yeah, that's true.  In fairness, that was a couple weeks ago, and I think it was like on the front page.  Oh, was it?  Okay.  All right.  I just didn't see it.  We had like a long weekend.  Oh, okay.  That was a big story, actually.  It's moving further into the paper as the day is going on.  So, yeah, I like the Hasidic Jews.  I don't like caddying for Jews in general, though.  I'll be honest with you.  Oh, jeez.  Now you're using the wide brush.  No, that wasn't the wide brush.  What?  They were notorious for making sure you didn't get a tip. 
[00:18:30]  You tell Ty Webb I'm gunning for him.  The mafia and the Italians were amazing to work for.  You're a good caddy.  That's very important.  But the Jews were bad, man.  Oh, my God.  They were bad.  We would get depressed.  Really?  No joke, yeah.  They just would not take care of us.  Would they get hot golfing in that attire?  Oh, no.  They were the regular Jews.  Oh, okay.  So they weren't the Hasidic Jews.  No, they were the regular ones.  Country club Jewish guys.  I'm just, my experience. 
[00:19:00]  I can't think of one that was good to us.  Wow.  And they were the ones that usually threw their clubs and just kind of had an attitude in general.  Maybe you guys were the assholes.  No, because then you've got the Italians and they're like fucking...  Well, they'd probably just drink in it.  They're giving you double pay, man.  Yeah, sure.  They would give you twice as much.  Money they just took off a dead guy.  Who cares?  Exactly.  The Jews weren't taking money from the neighborhood at gunpoint.  I never had a bad experience with the mafia, man.  Yeah, I haven't either, actually.  They were always good to me.  Neither have I.  Thank you.  They were always good to me.  There you go. 
[00:19:30]  There's no bit here.  They were always good to me.  And my brothers.  There is no mafia, by the way.  Huh?  There is no mafia.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Hey, man, I'm going way back.  I'm going way back when there absolutely was a mafia.  No, there was never a mafia.  It was the thing.  It's made up.  It was a made up thing.  Yeah.  Used to park cars at parties and stuff.  These guys were great.  Yeah.  They would grab a few of us for some of their fucking parties out there in Huntington Bay.  Used to park cars?  What the fuck?  Were you Henry Hill?  Growing up?  I only did that a couple times.  But we had opportunities for side work. 
[00:20:00]  We had to just be careful which one.  Did the neighborhood kids carry home the groceries for your mom one day?  Yeah.  I had a respect.  There were a couple guys that I caddy with that got side jobs.  Oh, yeah?  I don't know what kind of side jobs.  I'm just saying side jobs.  All right.  Like, I went to park cars once or twice.  I think it was twice officially.  They probably just wanted you to start them so if there was a bomb in there.  Yeah, let that fucking Opie kid start your car.  But there were other guys that were a little older.  They got better jobs. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, huh?  You could just tell there was something going on.  I don't know what it was.  I don't even know if it was illegal.  Opie sells cigarettes.  No idea.  No more letters from school.  No idea, but...  No more letters from school.  Right.  Fucking mama gets the head in the oven.  Love it.  So, yeah.  That's good.  Well, hopefully by the end of the summer, your air conditioning will work.  He's saying bye today or tomorrow.  Yeah.  I got my guys coming in.  But now I got to deal with permits.  You know, guys can't just come in and do work on your apartment in New York City. 
[00:21:00]  They have to get permits and they have to have insurance for well over a million dollars  just to work in your apartment.  Just because they fucked something up or kill somebody.  So it's a whole process.  So because of, you know, this wonderful building I live in, I have to be, you know, in horrible  heat for another day or two until they figure out the paperwork so a guy could take some  units out and steam clean them.  Imagine a fucking thing falls out the wall and cracks somebody on the head down.  I'm going to have huge holes in my fucking apartment for a day or two.  What are you going to do with that?  You can't have a fucking kid running around. 
[00:21:30]  Why?  That makes it a little more exciting.  That's what my wife said.  This could be a hole.  And the guy's like, no, we have cabinets.  So, you know, that's screw on.  Push some shit in front of it.  Nah, it'll be fine.  But I'm excited to see some holes in my apartment.  I'm going to take a little peek out the side.  Oh, man.  Lay down and just kind of...  Fuck yeah.  Oh, that'd be pretty creepy.  Did you see the...  I know everyone's been tweeting it a shitload and I finally looked at it yesterday.  You see the new Russian fucking kids video?  Oh, yeah.  I know we're a little late to it, but... 
[00:22:00]  I haven't seen it.  Dude.  They're doing some crazy shit.  I have to keep trying to tell myself this is just a video because you get...  You feel like you're up there.  You feel like you're up there.  Hands sweat, right?  Yes.  Dude, you see the one where he lifts himself up and then lets go of the thing totally  and then grabs back on?  No.  He's like going like this.  I didn't see that one.  Oh, it's fucking frightening.  Maybe there's a couple different ones going around.  This one was way up on a bridge.  Way, way the fuck above.  It's so high up.  Way the fuck above.  No, you didn't.  Yeah, I did.  You never did.  You never did. 
[00:22:30]  Way the fuck above.  Which one is this one?  Nope.  Oh, yay.  18,000 views?  I don't think so.  Oh, my God, Sam.  The one I saw was...  That might be it right there.  I saw...  Remind me, I saw a horrible video when we're done here.  Yeah, this is it.  This is another version of it.  This is the one I saw.  Well, look at the guy.  They're on rusty beams.  Ah.  They're on top of the fucking span.  Yes.  Look for the people out there.  I know we do a lot of visual shit, but this stupid company doesn't understand that yet. 
[00:23:00]  But Iraq is putting these videos up on our Facebook page right now, Opie and Anthony.  Russians climb huge bridge.  Yeah, look at this thing.  You don't see this one?  No.  They're looking...  Oh, you know what it is?  They're building like a span bridge, and they're looking down from the top of the span.  I think they're on a crane, or are they on top of the bridge itself?  I don't know, but it is...  It's all Russian, but...  Dude, they are...  Oh, they're on the arm of a crane.  Oh, this is easy.  So this one guy, he's on the arm of the crane, and then watch what he does. 
[00:23:30]  Fuck that.  I'm going to walk on the outside of this arm of the crane.  Look at that.  Sam, look.  He's on the outside of the arm of the crane.  Is that a chute or a backpack?  I don't know.  It looks like a backpack, but I'm wondering if it is a chute or no.  I think it's a chute in case they fall.  All right, then there's another video where guys are way up, and they have no chutes or anything.  Yeah, I see that.  Does that bother you?  Yeah, wow.  They're climbing on the outside of the yellow crane, and the point of view is that it's a helmet can,  so it looks like they're your hands.  Yeah, yeah, that's creepy. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, that's wow.  That's what it looks like.  That stinks.  Is that fucked up?  That's so high.  Yeah.  They're barely bound.  I don't even know how high that is.  Dude, that's fucking way up there.  Ah, they're touching.  They're high-fiving.  Stop high-fiving.  It'll fall.  But if you high-five on a sidewalk, you wouldn't even think twice about it.  I would be and go inside.  I love how Jimmy gets at these.  I don't get this.  He's like, ah.  I couldn't even do the inside thing.  No, I couldn't either, dude.  I don't think I could even do that part.  Ah. 
[00:24:30]  This is petrified.  And they're outside.  Dude, this is terrible.  Because the helmet cam view is killing me.  Oh, they get to the end of this crane.  I don't know.  What is that?  That's the boom arm of a crane.  Crane arm.  That's the boom arm of a crane.  It is.  You see the yellow going down to the bottom?  Holy fuck.  That's a big-ass crane.  They're very high.  It just.  Wow, man.  Ah.  This is fucking horrible.  I'm getting that slipping inside.  I'm just going like, whoa, whoa, and then trying to grab that last thing you feel when  you try to grab before you fall off.  Would you even stand there just on the end of the crane inside? 
[00:25:00]  I wouldn't either.  Go inside, sir.  Go inside, sir.  This is fucking horrible.  They're high-fiving.  It's terrible.  Now they're just sitting on the railing.  They're crazy, man.  Who sits on the railing?  They're just not afraid of heights, guys.  We know.  It's a bridge.  I don't know.  All those crazy Russians.  I hate these videos and love them at the same time, man.  They're higher than.  Look, they're higher than the sun.  Sunsetting in the background.  Wow, these guys are way fucking up there, man. 
[00:25:30]  I do.  I wouldn't even walk.  They have no fear of heights.  Like American Indians, they have no fear of heights.  I don't understand that at all.  I don't understand the fact that in Russia,  it seems like there's no security on things that are really high up.  People just stay able to climb these fucking things.  Because most people just assume no one's going to do it.  Yeah.  Which bottom left there, Sam?  There's another one where.  Yeah, I want to see the one that Anne's talking about.  On the I-beams doing exercises.  And it's fucking.  Put that in like exercise. 
[00:26:00]  Or no, that's not it.  You don't get upset?  I get upset.  Wait, what's he walking on top of?  What was that?  Oh, we've seen.  That is an I-beam.  Yeah, that's the.  Put in like crazy Russian exercise, I think.  Is this it?  No.  Crazy Russian acrobatics.  I don't care about crazy Russian acrobatics.  Oh my God, he's way up there.  He's up there, man.  Yeah, that guy.  Crazy Russian.  This is like the new thing now.  Is Russians standing on top of high things? 
[00:26:30]  How many of these are fucking.  Work out.  Yeah, that's it.  All right.  My hands are.  Imagine your sweaty hands.  Oh, wait till you see some of the shit this guy does.  Lock up.  These guys.  Oh, what is this?  Commercials.  Oh.  Yeah.  This guy does these pull-ups hanging onto an I-beam, and at the top of the pull-up, he  lets go, and then as he's like falling, he grabs back on again. 
[00:27:00]  No, that's impossible.  Yeah, I do that.  I swear.  Crazy.  Fuck you.  Oh, man.  All right, here we go.  Oh, shit.  That's horrifying.  All right.  Let's see.  Russians doing a suicidal workout.  Can you move the arrow, Sam?  How about you go full screen with it?  That's easy.  I can do the push-up thing.  Yeah.  Oh, no, you can't.  I would do that.  You would?  Look at the guy on the bottom.  I wouldn't do what the guy's doing on the bottom.  Dude, I can't do pull-ups.  He's doing pull-ups hanging from an I-beam.  Imagine you do so many that you have no strength left in your arms.  You can't pull yourself back. 
[00:27:30]  One would do it for me.  These guys are in good shape.  They've got to be fucking gymnasts.  They've got to be crazy.  Oh, my God.  They are on top of an I-beam.  It's so high up over like a forest.  Oh, there he is.  He's doing the push-ups.  Get the fuck out of here.  That's right.  Oh, my God.  How do you do so many pull-ups?  He's going upside down.  No, no, he can't.  He's doing acrobatics hanging from an I-beam. 
[00:28:00]  Right there.  I would forget how to get back.  You're in panic, right?  You know how strong his fingers must be?  He can't fucking poke me.  Look how high up he is.  Look at all that shit down there.  Oh, my God.  He's not connected to anything.  No.  No.  Wow.  These guys are doing that thing where you lift yourself by like you're doing a push-up  and your body is suspended over mid-air.  Yeah.  And they're doing it off an I-beam planking.  Yeah.  Oh, my.  I couldn't do that for one second on a floor.  And this guy is just straight-hanging.  Get out of here. 
[00:28:30]  Off an I-beam.  Off an I-beam.  Holy shit.  Parallel to the ground.  Crazy Russians.  They are in fucking-  This guy's twisting his arms as he lifts himself up.  Yeah, these are all obvious gymnasts, but it's still-  Do you know what it feels like if your hands slip?  Oh, this guy's got-  He's doing yoga stuff now.  He's standing on one foot.  The problem is-  It's windy up there.  It's really windy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And they're on an I-beam that's no more than what?  What is that, Ant?  Six inches across, maybe?  Five foot.  No.  It's like two six-inch pieces.  It's like a nice day out to do this.  Look at how windy it is.  Oh, my God. 
[00:29:00]  I don't know how to do it.  Wouldn't you bump it to the other guy by accident and knock him over?  Here's what the problem is.  As one guy's falling, he's going to grab the other guy.  Oh, yeah.  You're going to grab anything to try to stay alive, right?  Yeah, the only thing you can grab is the guy.  And then just plummeting.  How high are they?  It's so fucking high.  High enough to die.  There's a guy doing just push-ups on the I-beam.  He's smiling.  I would be frowning.  That's really scary.  He's having a great time. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, these guys are fucking nuts.  I want to see the videos of them falling because I know that they have to exist.  There has to have been people that have just lost their fucking grip.  Oh, yeah, this guy's doing push-ups.  He's suspending himself.  He's going off the ground on the push-ups.  Yeah.  That's fucking awesome.  He's in like a pike position.  They're above the trees.  I mean, you look down the bottom of the hill is where you can see all of this industrial building.  The railway yard, yeah.  Yeah, railway. 
[00:30:00]  How?  What do you think, like 300 or 400 feet in the air?  Well, how about you look at the handstand he's doing on a three-inch beam.  Maybe four inches.  I don't know how high up they'd be.  Dude, this stuff would be impressive if it was just in the gym.  Yeah, of course.  And they had like padding on the floor.  Yeah.  Wow, that guy's in good shape.  That's at least 300 feet off the ground.  So if you slip, you're dead.  Three to 400 feet easily.  You're dead, yeah.  You're so dead.  I think that's how all circus...  This should be the circus.  Yeah.  Just go there and watch Russians do this. 
[00:30:30]  No net.  Yeah.  Well, that's pretty fucking fright.  Oh, he does that thing again where he puts his legs above his head and...  Well, now we're getting...  Oh, man.  Hanging on by one arm.  He's doing one-arm pull-ups.  He's got to be the fucking team leader.  That's some strong Russian.  It's amazing how like this is gymnast are probably looking at us like,  Yeah, you fags.  This is easy.  But I just couldn't comprehend.  I don't understand the wind factor.  Well, it blows because it's...  There's too much wind for them to be trying half this shit. 
[00:31:00]  I get being in shape and all that and not being scared of heights, but...  I wouldn't be up there with the railing around me.  You're just assuming the wind's not going to push over?  And everything.  Oh, this is where he does that thing where he goes inverted.  He does like...  What do they call that?  He's creepy.  He's hand-walking, hanging from a beam out to the front.  And now he's holding on, going upside down.  Skin the cat, I think that's called.  I think.  Yeah, man.  Oh, he is.  And he's doing like...  He's bike riding upside down, hanging by his hands. 
[00:31:30]  You could picture him going like this.  Going like...  And of course.  That's from 1988.  What?  No, that's just his name.  His name.  Okay.  Oh.  Yeah.  Just be how old he is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh, that's on our Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  Goddamn crazy.  Now we're getting Russian Kid Climbs Like a Boss.  Like a boss?  Does death-defying stunts.  That's the name of the clip.  Climbs like a...  Death-defying stunts.  Okay, we're from Connecticut.  What is Climbs Like a Boss?  That's what they name...  Maybe he climbs and then drops the ball. 
[00:32:00]  Stops.  That's what they named the video.  He's holding on with one of my magnetic trays.  Stupid Yakov.  You want to redo that bit today?  With my magnetic dinner tray.  We haven't done that in a couple of weeks.  Let's redo that one.  A couple of weeks.  Please?  A couple of weeks.  Exactly.  I've got to get my fill.  Oh.  Oh, he's doing like that wacky fucking jumpy James Bond shit.  This guy's just running and jumping off of things.  Whoa.  That was pretty impressive.  He's on the ledge of a building and he just ran into like a side somersault. 
[00:32:30]  Right.  Dude, look how high up he was.  Holy fuck, he would have been dead.  Oh, easily.  Yeah, he's probably like 15 floors up.  Yeah, he stumbled a little bit.  All the videos we're talking about, once again, will be on our Facebook page.  This guy's nuts.  He's doing all kinds of these moves on a rooftop where, you know, acrobatics and...  Gymnastic spins and...  Where you run against the wall and walk up the wall and then do a backflip over.  This is a big thing.  A lot of the kids are trying this shit.  I guess...  Oh, yeah?  What a good climber is best.  Climbing and running and...  Little monkey.  ...jumping off shit. 
[00:33:00]  That would be fun to just climb like that all day if you were able to do it.  I used to love climbing.  Not like this, obviously.  I remember when you ran up the apple tree.  I was a tree climber.  Oh, yeah?  You climbed those trees on Long Island Inn?  No, I didn't.  As a kid, I made tree forts.  I used to make tree forts.  So you'd have to climb the tree with the wood in your hands and nail it up there.  Yeah, I used to love climbing way up in the trees.  You had to find the trees where you figured if you fell, you had some chances on the way  down to grab some shit. 
[00:33:30]  Some branches.  Yeah, some of these idiots would climb the trees where you had one shot.  That I couldn't do.  Yeah.  I had one of our neighbor kids.  We had a tree fort in our backyard, and he was up in the tree, and he went to cross  over and grab onto this two-by-four, and it wasn't nailed to anything.  So he fell out of the tree and broke his leg.  Oh, fuck.  Wow.  Look at this one.  He didn't die yet, right?  From ledge to ledge.  He jumps off a ledge.  I got a corner of a building.  Look at this.  Oh!  Get the fuck out of here. 
[00:34:00]  No fucking way!  He jumps.  He did a somersault off a ledge about 10 feet down onto another ledge, and they are literally,  I'd say 20 stories up.  20 stories up.  That's easy.  How the fuck is he not dead?  Maybe he is.  One mistake.  Maybe he is.  That was very impressive, because he did a running somersault in kind of into the middle  of nowhere.  And then we got this one, Sam.  Wow.  That's fucking nuts.  Where is it?  Parkour, they call it. 
[00:34:30]  Parkour.  Free running.  Man climbs the top of Moscow's skyscraper in most dangerous stunt.  Is that...  Moscow's skyscraper.  I wonder if that's...  What's his name?  Did we just do that one?  No.  By the way, the most amazing one is still the Twin Tower thing.  Oh, yeah.  Philippe Petit.  He was a weird fucking dude when we interviewed him.  Philippe Petit.  Nothing but respect for what that guy did back in 77, maybe?  Was that long ago, yeah?  Something like that. 
[00:35:00]  I'm wondering, is this the guy...  The guy...  Oh, God.  We watched him many times.  Robert.  Alan Rob...  Elaine Robert or Robert?  I don't know.  Is that him or no?  No, this is just the guy...  No.  This is just the guy...  Oh, wow.  That shouldn't be up there.  600 feet up.  Helmet cam.  What is he on?  Aruniasov hauled himself precariously to the top of the skyscraper in Moscow.  Was I the only one that wasn't sure that was English at first?  Yeah.  A skyscraper in Moscow. 
[00:35:30]  Ah.  Well, he's like right at the...  He's on top and you can see his hands and they feel like your hands again.  Oh, my God.  Get off that.  Don't do that.  Aruniasov's video shows some impressive panoramic views.  You're going to fall, sir.  Jimmy's shaking.  What do you do from there?  On his YouTube channel, he wrote the climb was the most dangerous thing he's ever done in his life.  Please don't repeat under any circumstances.  But how did he get down?  How did he get up there?  I would need a helicopter to come just get me. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, you'd freeze, right?  You'd just be like, ah, I can't do anything.  You'd just annoy everyone because they would have to get you down.  Yeah, they'd have to look up there.  Help me.  With a basket and a real man grabbing you off the top of the tower.  Humiliating.  How humiliating would that be?  That would be very humiliating.  That video sucked, by the way, because how did he get up there?  Yeah.  I want to see them going down.  Like, how do you get down from there?  Getting down is, I think, just as hard.  That guy might be a worker and they dropped him off to fucking change a light bulb or something. 
[00:36:30]  I don't know.  Oh, that's the famous one that started this whole thing.  The massive climb up antenna station.  The guy that just climbs to the top.  That's just his job.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Another helmet cam.  Yeah, we've seen that one a million times.  This one gets crazier and crazier.  He's got his fucking tools.  That's right.  Should I bring my fucking tools?  So, once again, go to Facebook.  All the videos we just watched are up there.  Opie and Anthony.  Like us motherfuckers.  I went back into my attic yesterday. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, you're doing AC shit too, right?  Well, I got the AC guys coming over today.  But it's a simple problem.  Just fucking filters.  So I went up there and had to pull my filters out so it would work.  So I'm running filterless just for a day.  And then they got to get in there.  Because it was 90 degrees.  In your room?  In my room.  There's nothing worse than trying to sleep when you're fucking sweating.  How bad is it to go filterless for a day?  Not bad for a day.  As long as you're not cutting sheetrock in your house.  Well, what happens? 
[00:37:30]  It blows that shit all over the place?  Instead of a filter, it goes into your coil.  And then it clogs up all those little fins on the coil.  Right.  And there's nowhere for the air to go.  So the coil freezes up into a big block of ice and the blower can't blow the fucking air.  And you get nothing.  I was by myself last night because my wife and kid can't handle the heat.  And I'm just sitting in the living room.  It's 90 degrees.  I'm watching basketball like it's nothing.  Oh, I hate that.  And I think, and everyone looks at me weird.  And I think it goes back to when I was a caddy. 
[00:38:00]  Like the heat doesn't bother me as much.  I don't mind heat outside.  But in the house when you're trying to relax, it's the worst.  I mean, I'm exaggerating at 90, but it was probably easily in the 80s.  Easily.  Yeah.  And I'm just sitting there.  I have a window open, so warm air is blowing on me.  Yeah, it's just warm air.  My wife walks into the living room.  She's looking at me like, what's wrong with you?  We're in the nice, cold fucking bedroom right now.  But I like hanging out on my couch and watching my big TV.  And not in the heat.  I think it goes back to caddy because, I mean, we fucking, holy fuck, 70, 80 pound bags when 
[00:38:30]  you're carrying two of them around a golf course in the middle of summer.  Somehow I think I just adapted.  I don't know.  And I say for Italians, this is skilled labor.  And I went for like a 12 mile bike ride in that heat yesterday.  Yeah.  It doesn't bother me.  I like it.  Do you know what I almost did last night, man?  Because I was, I'm so annoyed at myself physically.  I almost went for a jog at 11 o'clock at night.  Dude, I wanted to jog.  I'm like, I want to just, I follow Sebastian Bach on Twitter and he's like a runner. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  So once in a while you'll see like, yeah, we're not ran seven miles.  He's like a big, tall, lanky fucker in shape.  Right.  And I'm like, why don't I jog once in a while?  And I'm like, I was going to go outside and just jog around the block once like an old  lady.  But I just, I was like 11 o'clock.  I'm like, I just, I was tired.  I'm like, fuck it.  Do something to that.  Fuck it.  We're almost too old to jog is the problem.  Do you think so?  That used to be my number one exercise, but my knees, fuck.  Is it bad for your knees?  Well, that's why I'm on the bike a lot more. 
[00:39:30]  It's easier.  The bike's good?  Yeah.  And I went back to inline skating.  I call it inline skating, assholes.  Oh, rollerblading?  No, inline skating.  I look like I'm fucking trying out for the Olympics when I do it.  Isn't that like, uh, not many people are doing that anymore?  No.  No.  Why aren't they?  No.  Because they fucking hurt themselves.  It became like a thing.  Yeah.  It was a fad.  I want to get out and start exercising a lot.  I'm sleeping a little better with this mountain car right now, and I want to do something.  Where you live, you should get a nice bike. 
[00:40:00]  I could turn you on to a few different bikes, and you'd hit that park along the river.  Just take the seat off and have fun.  Oh, by the way, I spent hours yesterday going back to you going, how come your puppet says  out?  It's all I was doing was laughing at that fucking, at that line over and over again.  Yeah, a couple of people found that funny.  That's what you should do.  Get a bike.  I know, I know, dude.  I really want to, man.  I'm so sick of my fucking self.  It's a nice ride all the way up to the GWB.  You don't worry about getting mugged?  Then you go the other way and go all the way down to the World Trade Center, or the 
[00:40:30]  new World Trade Center.  It gets a little squirrely.  Yeah?  Going up or down?  Up.  Man, I go through an area where I don't even know what language they're speaking.  Oh.  But they're having such a good time that I just get roped in.  Caught up in it?  I do.  It's very festive up there.  I'm like, man, it must be nice not to have to work and have a picnic every day.  Yeah.  Imagine having a picnic every day.  How cool would that be?  Well, they're working, I bet. 
[00:41:00]  And then they were playing baseball up that way.  And I guess it was in Spanish, I would assume.  They had the loudspeakers and the guys were calling the game and stuff.  And, man, they just...  This is going to bother Anthony, but they just don't take care of minority people's things.  Their baseball field is so shitty compared to what I see right outside my window.  Well, how about maybe they fix it up themselves?  Take a little initiative.  Take the drug dealers out at night. 
[00:41:30]  This baseball field hasn't been mowed in, I don't know.  Yeah?  Oh, it's ridiculous.  I was embarrassed as a white person.  It's dangerous when you're fucking mowing it and fucking heroin needles are flying out of the lawnmower.  I was embarrassed.  Yeah.  Because then there's a pristine field right outside my window.  It looks like the Yankees can play there.  Oh, yeah?  Nice.  And no one's ever on it.  Well, you pay high enough taxes.  Is that what that's about?  Your shit should be good.  Because as soon as you start taking a bike ride up Riverside Park, you notice the change as you get more and more north. 
[00:42:00]  Everything in real life can be equated to Sim City.  Is that what that's about?  Yeah.  You ever pull off some money from an area in Sim City?  Yeah.  And it starts going a little to hell?  Yeah.  That's what happens.  You put a lot of police in one area and then there's no crime.  Yeah.  It's just, it's basic.  It's Sim fucking.  I think anybody that becomes a mayor, you should, like, play Sim City, set it up as close to your city as possible, and then see how it runs.  Yeah.  Because it's probably pretty realistic. 
[00:42:30]  The bike path gets a little bumpier.  Gets a little bumpier.  Oh, my God.  People start complaining.  They're like, looking all mad.  They get that exclamation point over their head.  Yeah.  Ah, I'm angry.  And you've got to fix it.  I negotiate my water with these people.  It's nice.  See?  It's fun.  It's different.  You would never do that, right?  Never.  Not a chance.  How do you do, what do you do with that?  What is that about?  What?  I like biking to the bridge.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  No one stopped me to pay a toll yet or anything. 
[00:43:00]  I'm good.  Yeah?  A lot of white people do it, though.  No, that's fine.  A lot of white people do it.  Yeah, seeing white people on a bike path is not exactly, you know, everyone's used to this.  People don't usually run out and slam the bike over.  No.  But, man, they like that reggaeton.  Yeah?  That reggaeton.  Remember, Elo told us that was going to be the number one format.  In America, and that motherfucker was right.  Do you wear a helmet, Leroy?  No.  My skull's my helmet.  Oh, that's nice.  Why?  Because we all decide we need helmets?  No, I think you should be grandfathered in without a helmet. 
[00:43:30]  It's fine.  It's not illegal.  No, I didn't wear a helmet.  I probably would, though.  Why?  Because there's all the precious thoughts in this little noggin.  Oh, that's true.  I haven't fallen on a bike since I played Evel Knievel as a kid.  That's a real long time ago.  I'm not falling off my bike.  Maybe if somebody might knock you up by mistake, a kid might run out and bump into you, or a fucking  someone throws a rock at you?  I don't need a fucking helmet.  I guess I have to give my kid a helmet.  Well, yeah.  He wears a helmet.  Oh, I was going to say, he doesn't wear one? 
[00:44:00]  No, he does.  He's already biking around?  No.  Those tender little baby heads, they're like fucking robin eggs.  Remember robin eggs?  Jeez, those things, they're not very durable, are they?  You ever try to keep a bird alive when you're growing up?  We did.  Oh, everybody has.  Because we had a nice backyard, a lot of woods, and we were always finding these fucking  birds and bringing them in and being disappointed every time when they died.  They always die?  You can't handle that as a 10-year-old.  No.  Your little bird dying that you thought you could nurse back to fucking hell. 
[00:44:30]  Tweet.  Tweet.  Those fucking robin eggs, though, they're like rolling papers, the fucking outside of  them.  Right.  There's nothing.  It would start off good.  You would keep the bird alive for a day or two, and then you would run downstairs all  excited in the morning and see this dried up dead thing.  Some dead bird with his neck all twisted around.  Right, a 10-year-old can't handle that, Dad.  Like he watched The Ring.  Right.  Yeah.  We used to have a bird lady.  Yeah, crazy bird lady?  Asher Oaken.  Yeah.  People might know.  Was she crazy? 
[00:45:00]  No, man, but she took all birds in.  So if you found one in your driveway that fell out of a nest or something, because we  tried to do it ourselves and we finally gave up on that, and then you bring it to the  bird lady.  You just kick them to the side.  It was a nice ride out to Asher Oaken.  You handed the bird off to the bird lady, and then you go back a few months later to  check out the bird.  I wonder if she's still alive.  Probably not.  It was like a gimmick.  Yeah, she was cool.  Yeah.  You didn't have to pay her nothing.  It was one of those nice little things.  Birds falling out of the nest.  It's just like, eh, whatever.  And things are going to die anyway. 
[00:45:30]  You can't touch them.  Don't touch it.  No, because then the birds get pissed and go, fuck that.  Now I've got to kill my own kid.  There was so many.  Yeah.  No, that's what they would do.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't like the human smell on there.  Something.  I don't know.  Yeah, we could get somebody that knows more about it.  There were always so many of those rules as a kid.  You could have these little rules and urban myths that were real.  Like which one?  Praying Mantis, $50.  Yeah, Praying Mantis.  Exactly.  Praying Mantis.  Wait, that wasn't real? 
[00:46:00]  It might be, but I don't think so.  The curb is government's property.  You can stand it.  They were like fucking, it was like battle lines were drawn.  It's like, get off my lawn.  I'm on the curb.  It's government property.  Government property.  Government property was like the fucking, yeah, I can stand wherever I am.  Government property.  Don't touch the bird.  I'll sue you.  Kids were so litigious back then.  I'll sue.  How do you get fucking the skunk smell off you?  Yes, tomato juice.  How does every fucking person know that? 
[00:46:30]  Everybody knows that.  It just goes from the Partridge Family episode.  We could have killed Praying Mantises.  Well, you know what?  They said no, but did you ever see the Praying Mantis police patrolling around, handing out fines?  But as soon as you saw one, you thought you were looking at like gold or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, there's a Praying Mantis.  Give it some room.  You were always giving it some room.  It was that.  It was the bird thing.  You don't touch the bird.  And I was always, my mom would always tell me everything was fucking diseased. 
[00:47:00]  Just like, don't touch it.  Don't touch the, it's a dead mouse.  You know, don't touch it.  It's a disease.  It's got a disease.  Dead bird.  Don't touch it.  And I wouldn't touch it.  I'd be all scared of it.  Trying to remember all the ones.  I know you didn't touch like birds because then the mama bird would kill the baby bird.  Yeah.  Praying Mantis you have.  We're missing some good ones.  Yeah, there's plenty of them.  Never snitch on the adult.  Oh, don't go in the pool after you eat. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  That just came in from little Jimmy from Jersey.  Yeah, as a kid, though, there's all those little things in the neighborhood that would go around.  You'd be petrified by it.  Jimmy, get a bike.  I know I should.  People are asking what bike I ride.  Why does that matter to anyone?  What?  Oh, what kind of bike?  Yeah.  I go with a hybrid just because I want to jump on a couple of paths every once in a while.  I ride one with a giant front wheel and the tiny little back wheel. 
[00:48:00]  I wear a gentleman's hat.  Mountain bike, the wheels are too big, too thick for what I do.  And I don't want to look like Lance Armstrong.  I hate those fucking assholes.  I see them all the time.  You don't dress in all that spandex with an aerodynamic helmet?  With a cock bulge just to go around the park a couple times?  You look like an idiot.  I like the guy who's just standing there with cock bulge, drinking his water.  Yeah.  How are you doing?  You look like a fucking idiot. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  I dress appropriately.  Loose-fitting clothes.  Yeah.  No cock balls.  No.  A pair of shorts, a fucking rock t-shirt, and I'm gone.  All these guys are idiots.  I've got to get just a compilation video of all these idiots in the park that think they're  trying out for the Olympics or something.  Yeah.  They're all, oh, my God.  Yeah.  That's exactly what I see.  Sam's pulling up the famous picture where all the guys don't know what to do with their  cocks.  They're wearing these tight spandex shorts, and their dicks are like, it's like a bank 
[00:49:00]  robber's face when they pull a stock in them.  Yeah, exactly.  Your dick just doesn't know what to do.  You see these idiots in Central Park every day.  Every day.  They look like jerks.  They really look stupid.  The tiny little seat, too.  Huh?  The tiny little bike seat that goes up their asshole.  Yeah.  I mean, they're getting good work out of it, but I don't understand why you have to wear  a fucking outfit.  Yeah.  The outfit.  It's like, yeah, it's like it's Halloween.  What are you dressed as? 
[00:49:30]  I don't wear outfits to work out.  I just fucking find shit, and I go to the gym, or I go on my bike.  A lot of wind resistance with you, I guess, flapping clothes.  But that's got to take a few, uh...  Makes you work harder.  That's true, see?  I think it's good for the workout.  Sam's favorite page.  Would you bookmark this one?  Nice.  Guys with fucking tight spandex.  Yeah, I don't really understand that.  I would assume you just want to show off your cock.  Yeah.  Right?  To other men, I think. 
[00:50:00]  Right?  Yeah.  Because are women getting into that?  I don't think so.  Oh, jeez.  I'm looking at cock bulges, because guys have to, like, dress like Lance Armstrong on a bike.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think they're doing that for girls.  For the ladies?  I don't think so.  It's the guys.  I think girls would look at that and laugh at you.  They would.  Like, what an idiot you are.  It's not a good way to present your dick to a woman.  It's not, right?  Yeah.  Women don't like having your dick presented to them like that.  I don't know.  We should ask the ladies, because I don't really know. 
[00:50:30]  I would assume.  I would assume they...  I think women like the dick presented in intimate moments.  Like on a train.  If you're on the train, and some girl, you know, she doesn't have to be great attractive.  She doesn't have to, you know, be a pig or anything.  But she lifts her skirt up.  She's not wearing panties.  And you just see her pussy as you're riding on the train.  Are you yelling for the police?  Hell no.  And shit.  And be like, oh my god.  No.  But if you present your penis to a woman on the train, well, now there's going to be  trouble.  Well, there will be a problem.  Yes.  But that, in essence, is what it's all about. 
[00:51:00]  But it doesn't mean we shouldn't try.  Women don't want it presented like that.  It doesn't mean the woman isn't accepting of the penis in certain situations, like an intimate  moment, something like that.  But if you're just on the train, I don't think they want to see it.  No.  Yeah, they really don't.  I thought they would, too.  Oh, Jimmy.  You think so?  What happened?  Oh, nothing.  A Cialis and a pair of form-fitting slacks.  And you're like, look at this.  Look at how good it looks.  You can see it.  They should enjoy that. 
[00:51:30]  You'd think so, wouldn't you?  Why wouldn't they?  Against the back of the old knuckles.  You ladies are fucking fuddy-duddies.  Just enjoy the dick.  God, that girl's beautiful, by the way.  And on iMister's show, she's like something Wang, her name is Wang Morris, her first name,  I forget.  You're digging her?  Beautiful fucking girl, man.  She's got the right mixture of Asians.  God, is she pretty, man?  You mix up that Asian in the right way, and you've got a supermodel.  But is she in China?  Oh, she's probably not in China.  She's probably here in the background.  I don't know.  I see that fucking thing behind her.  Yeah, I know.  It's probably a back door.  I'm so naive.  Is it, though? 
[00:52:00]  I don't know.  She looks kind of like she's there.  The lighting's very good.  I wouldn't mind smooching with her.  She's in Ching Chang.  Ching Chang.  I love their roofs.  They're dumb.  They're funny fucking...  That looks...  Theidre Wang Morris.  Those roofs...  Those roofs look exhausting to build.  Oh, my God.  Imagine that.  How do you fucking line everything up perfectly?  Amazing.  Yeah, it's like a little fucking curvy pyramid up there.  How about a nice triangle?  Yeah, how about some shingles?  I think we figured it out for the world.  Stop with your weird roofs.  Or roofs. 
[00:52:30]  I don't know.  Is it roofs or roofs?  What about the Russian ones?  Those big onion dome things?  Oh, God.  I don't even know how you build that.  They look silly.  Is that built in pieces?  I guess so.  What is it called?  Silly.  I think it is like an onion dome, they call it.  Is it really?  Yeah, yeah.  Fucked up.  Yeah, the rest of the world's stupid.  They are.  Just go with a regular peak roof, you dummy.  That Indian shit, what they build?  What?  What?  How do you build that?  Look at that.  Why would you build it that way?  I don't know.  So you can't climb? 
[00:53:00]  I'm guessing so that raiders can't climb up and take the cross off the top?  Wow, that's pretty good.  That's just a thought.  That big, baldness, circular thing.  How the fuck do you climb that?  How do you get around that to get the cross?  Look at that.  Like, what?  What are you doing?  They look like Christmas ornaments upside down on top of the buildings.  Yeah.  I wish I was tall enough to sit on those things.  Giant butt plugs.  I don't know.  Oh, inside of golf ball, mysterious poison.  Zeus from Connecticut just brought back a memory. 
[00:53:30]  I was told that.  Being a caddy most of my life.  You ever cut open a golf ball?  Yes.  We were told there was poison in there.  It gets fun until all of a sudden you hit that fucking rubber band and that thing goes  flying everywhere.  It opens up like those Chinese noodles.  Yeah.  You got to cut it just right.  Out of nowhere.  You're cutting too deep.  Yeah.  You cut just slight and that thing will unravel in front of your eyes.  Nice.  Bounce it all over the place.  I don't realize how durable a fucking golf ball is. 
[00:54:00]  Why don't we...  Whacked around.  How about we cut open golf balls in the studio?  That could be good.  No, there's poison in there.  Oh, yeah.  Poison thing.  Let me do that.  Want to take a break?  Yeah, I got to eat.  Before we do break.  That was another one.  Don't swim for an hour after you eat.  Yeah.  That was something as a kid.  You would fucking have constantly...  And let me tell you something.  Now, I eat.  I go right in the fucking pool.  I'm a rebel.  And you know what happens?  Nothing.  No cramps.  Remember as a kid, you'd run back and forth to your parents and you'd be on the clock? 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  They go in the pool.  Why would they keep you out of the pool?  I don't know.  What the fuck was the problem?  I have no idea.  I guess they didn't want to watch you.  They constantly got to watch to make sure you're not drowning.  And they want to enjoy their lunch.  Yeah.  And you'd like to wolf yours down to get back in the pool.  And they're like, I'm not going to fucking watch this kid.  No, you've got to wait an hour.  So they've been tricking us.  Yeah, it's a trick.  Motherfuckers.  It's a trap.  All right.  We got Mickey Ward coming in at nine o'clock from The Fighter, of course.  Yeah.  He was the one that Mark Wahlberg played, right? 
[00:55:00]  Yes.  Okay.  Mackie Mack.  And they're friends in real life, too.  Mackie Mack.  I can do things.  You don't even know.  Oh, fucking boogie nights.  Also.  So good.  So good.  We also got an update on that girl that went right through that lady's house.  Yes.  This story has all the great features, man.  Fucking.  We'll give you the latest on this.  It's great.  And what?  We got another zombie thing.  Yeah.  Got another zombie thing.  Yeah.  That's two zombies already.  Yeah, yeah.  There's some zombie adventures going on around the country. 
[00:55:30]  We got a new zombie story.  Jimmy, you had something before the break?  Just.  I saw.  I don't know what.  I Twittered a link to the article, not the video.  It's one of the most upsetting videos I've ever seen.  It's all over.  It's a very, very.  Interracial marriage.  I couldn't get over it.  I'm like, what are they doing?  Doesn't she know better?  All right.  Next time, I'll keep the camera on longer when that guy's streaking.  Fuck.  To this woman, this Asian woman who was beating her baby. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, no.  I can't watch that.  I could.  I tell you.  That's my line now.  I haven't seen it.  I'll literally walk out of the studio like a bitch.  Really?  Fucking.  I can't watch it.  Oh, is it off?  I Twittered.  I Twittered a link to the article, not the video.  What's she do?  She just is hitting her baby for like four minutes.  In the head?  All over.  Yeah.  And it's all over YouTube.  And it's fucking.  It's amazing the murderous rage you build up watching.  Like, I don't even watch this.  Is she talking?  No.  She's just. 
[00:56:30]  She's from Malaysia.  And apparently, she's been convicted and is in jail for this.  Oh.  Like, she got a year and a half in jail.  Wow.  But it's.  Malaysian jail, too.  Fucking.  Some guy emailed me the link and he goes, see how long you can go without tapping it.  And I actually tapped it.  I couldn't.  I watched it.  I didn't even look.  I'm looking at the likes and dislikes.  Someone liked it.  There's like a fuckload of dislikes.  That's kind of funny.  But then there's a few that's like, yeah, I like this.  You got it.  It's kind of funny.  It's all over.  I've never seen more red in a video. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  But that little green.  That's kind of funny, man.  I like that.  Look, I can't watch this shit, but I know funny.  That's kind of funny.  That's not the only link to it.  There's a lot of it.  It's all over the fucking internet.  I haven't seen that yet.  I just saw it and it was fucking horrible.  But it's amazing to me the murderous rage you build up watching this woman.  Like, I couldn't believe how bad I wanted to do it.  You want to just sink your fucking teeth.  Yeah.  Like, I understand how people bite each other.  I really do.  Yeah, you are a biter.  Yeah.  A biter. 
[00:57:30]  But you understand how somebody can just really murder somebody with their bare hands and horses.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, having a kid that just, I tap out of all that stuff now.  I can't.  It's awful.  It's the worst, I'll say the worst non-death video.  Really?  I've ever seen it.  By far.  What about the one where the father has beaten the daughter?  This is much worse.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's upsetting.  Yeah.  That's upsetting.  But at least you know that girl made a decision to tape that piece of shit and judge father  and you know his life is being ruined. 
[00:58:00]  And there's part of you that also understands because you know how bitchy teenagers can be.  This is fucking.  Well, the innocence of a child, that's brutal.  It's fucking horrid.  I thought, I go to the playgrounds almost every day with my kid.  So do I.  Oh.  I thought by now I would see shitty parents as far as like maybe, you know, giving their  kid a slap or something.  Yeah.  Don't see it.  Oh, it's just not done anymore in public.  Don't see it, which I'm relieved because I don't know what I would do if I saw that. 
[00:58:30]  I used to like the fucking arm.  I'd be lifted up by one arm, shaking around, and then you get the smack on the ass.  Knock it off.  Dude.  You know what the new thing is, though?  Kids will yell the word bully at playgrounds.  No way.  And it stops everyone in their tracks.  Holy shit.  They use that word like it's nothing now.  I was at the park yesterday and this kid, it was just a dumb fighting over a frisbee or  some dumb little thing that we all did.  Simple.  One kid just fucking stops and goes, bully, bully, and the kid like panics and drops the 
[00:59:00]  frisbee.  I'm not.  I swear.  Right.  And all the parents turn around like, we got a bully in this playground.  We got to take care of that immediately.  This is crazy.  And it was just kid shit.  I mean, I, you know, I'm aware enough.  No, I'm aware enough.  Kid walking around, punching other kids in the face.  It was just kid shit we all did.  And this kid had no problem yelling bully immediately to stop the action.  You know, it's like the kid stuff that we all did.  I, I agree with you.  Like the people are getting softer, but then I'm like, did we turn out so great? 
[00:59:30]  Like, meaning the collective we, like when you look at kids not bullying, like it's easy  to go, yeah, fuck them.  But it's like, that's kind of nice to grow up and not have your fucking ass kicked for  no reason.  I don't know.  I think, I think it breeds fucking wimps.  Yeah, it breeds people that are like some of these stupid fucking Occupy Wall Street  people.  Just breeds this fucking entitlement thing.  That's the negative side.  But again, in the 60s, look what, look what happened to it.  And there was bullying back then, but look at the entitlement they had.  Free, free love of the 70s. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, that's what I've read.  It's so easy to say this, but I think the answer is somewhere in the middle.  It really is.  Yeah.  How this kid just yelled bully, like just knew all I have to do is yell bully to get out  of this situation.  And my parents will come running and this kid will probably panic a little bit.  I was like, really?  I mean, it was just dumb kid shit.  Yeah.  Kid wasn't being pushed over or hit with anything.  There wasn't really a bullying situation.  No, no.  But I've, I've heard that a couple of times though.  These kids know just, they know to yell bully and they've been taught in school that that 
[01:00:30]  shit is not going to be tolerated at all on any level.  How are you supposed to pin a kid down with your knees on his shoulders and spit in his  face?  Right.  He yells bully well before that happens.  You know, when you look at like all these fuck, this whole big movement against bullying  and stuff, it's all because of these school shootings.  That's what got the whole country going.  What the fuck is happening?  And I've always said that I would never encourage people to shoot anybody, but I would, I just  wish on some random level it happened to certain people in banks and wall street who stole 
[01:01:00]  from people on such a level.  I've always thought like I would love for those people to be dragged out in the street  and shot again.  I would never encourage it, but I would, I wish it would happen and I could report that  it happened.  Right.  Uh, that's how you get people to stop doing shit.  That's when people notice when, when the, when the penalty is so fucking horrible that  nobody wants to deal with it anymore.  Do I sound like a lunatic?  Maybe a little bit, but you know what?  They keep doing it.  Yeah.  They keep fucking ripping people off for everything and they suffer no penalty and they keep getting 
[01:01:30]  the same ridiculous, non punishments.  I heard in India, they drag some CEO in the street and shot him or beat him to death, whatever  they did.  And that put me on this fucking thought process.  Fuck yeah.  Like I'll bet you that fucking no one in that company ever ripped off all the people again  because they were beating to death.  If I saw that in America, I wouldn't be too bummed.  I wouldn't either.  I wouldn't be bummed at all.  Uh, one other thing about the playground and then I'll fucking move on.  Yesterday, I, I turned to my left and proceeded to start to pet what I thought was a dog. 
[01:02:00]  Uh oh.  Cause it was right near my feet.  It was a giant water rat.  It was a raccoon.  Oh, no way.  Right.  Another one.  I have a dumb video.  It's not worth even promoting.  In the daytime?  I didn't pet it cause then I realized it was a raccoon and then ran for my kid like everyone  else did.  This thing was wandering around the playground and, and, uh, and during the day.  Oh man, on a hot day.  That means rabies.  And it went for a drink of water.  There's a, this, this little dumb river thing that this one playground has.  And he went in for a drink and everyone's like, what the fuck? 
[01:02:30]  And then just, usually they don't like water when they got rabies.  Oh really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They got like hydrophobia.  I think it was just so fucking hot.  I said, fuck it.  I'm not waiting until dark.  I need to drink some water.  That could just be, maybe that.  But I thought it was a dog and I, I, I turned and I don't know if I was going to officially  pet it, but I turned like, oh, a dog and went, holy shit.  I've never been that close to a raccoon.  Raccoons are so fucking nasty.  They are right.  When, when they're cornered, they will, they make like a fucking crazy sound. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  I had one in a cage that was trapped at my house.  You got video of that?  I don't remember.  Yeah.  I had video of it.  I saw the video, right?  And it was like, I started getting close to it and it goes, rah, it starts barking at  you.  Do they bother you in like, in an open space like that if they're not rabid?  Like you saw that one there.  This one.  Now for the most part, they're afraid, but if you corner them or threaten them, uh, yeah,  it gets crazy.  This one made an aggressive move toward everyone just to fucking make sure everyone knows who  was boss in that situation.  And then, and then it took a drink of water and then it fucking moseyed off, but it definitely 
[01:03:30]  moved toward us in a, uh, a relatively quick fashion, a couple of feet, you know, forward.  I will tell you one thing.  They are adorable.  Do they have a little mask?  Are they, are they good pets at all?  Does anyone have them as pets?  I don't think anyone's trying that one.  Just for the fact that not many people have them as pets probably shows that they're not  very good pets.  From the time they're babies, if you raise one from a pup, someone's got one.  Yeah, but didn't they?  Oh yeah, I'm sure people have them, but it doesn't seem to be that thing that a lot  of people do. 
[01:04:00]  But they, you can't cut that part of their brain out where one day they don't recognize  you as the owner anymore and try to eat your face.  That instinct.  Right.  Sam picked the worst fucking video too.  It's not mad.  It's just creeping around the cage.  Raccoon gets caught in a cage and gets out.  He gets out.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Who cares?  He's in the cage.  Is he...  I want the angry one.  He's very cute.  He makes sounds.  I want to pet a raccoon.  I want to make sounds.  I was proud of myself that I ran for my kid instead of my camera yesterday.  That's why I don't have any proof that this raccoon thing happened, by the way. 
[01:04:30]  I had to make a decision, and I was glad to know my brain still thinks kid first.  All right.  All right.  Where's yours, man?  Yours is good.  Well, Sam doesn't want to play mine.  Why not, Sam?  Why don't you play the bosses?  And then let's put it up on the Facebook page, Opie and Anthony.  Jeez.  God, we're promoting Facebook a lot today, and that company sucks a dick.  Jimmy.  Jimmy!  Jimmy!  They're dropping. 
[01:05:00]  I bought in a 30.  I may sell.  I'll let it go a little bit, and I'll sell.  I mean, whatever.  If you think of loss, think of loss.  It's down to 28.  It's lost about...  $25 billion.  A quarter of its value.  Has it really?  Yeah.  $25 billion it lost.  Is that the quarter?  A quarter of its value.  25%.  24 and change it.  Was it just overvalued, though?  Maybe it was never worth that much money.  Where it went?  Oh, well.  I don't know.  I don't know what to make of this stock.  I've just been staying away from it.  I don't know what to do.  I'd like to maybe short it a little bit, but... 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, it's lost $25 billion in a week.  I made another stock pick that was a dud.  I used to have to say, you know, you take a couple...  You've got to take the hits.  I've got a big one, but...  I'll say.  I've got a big...  Well, yeah.  I don't know where it went.  I think Facebook is...  They say it's worth like $13 a share.  I've heard the analysts have said, like, if it's with growth and all that shit...  I wouldn't fucking touch that thing.  No way.  Rarely stocks that are well-publicized, their value is based on actual numbers. 
[01:06:00]  It's so weird.  Like, they go, let's look at the fundamentals.  And then you base what the stock price should be.  Ah, shit.  Still got phlegmy throat.  Oh, sweetie.  What the stock price should be based on, you know, the company's earnings.  But then there's other stocks that, for no reason at all, are worth a fuckload of money,  even though their numbers don't add up.  And Facebook could be one of those situations. 
[01:06:30]  They don't even know, no one really even has a clue what they're going to announce when  they're able to talk, and probably sometime after July, they're going to be able to make  some kind of announcements.  You're number two.  Oh.  There's your second record.  He's so cute.  I get close to the cage, and Scooty does.  No.  Can you get out?  What do you say?  Don't put your hand right there.  Oh, look.  He gets nipped.  Don't put it.  He's going to bite you.  He can't get through the cage.  No.  Wow.  It screams at you.  Oh, no.  It screams at you. 
[01:07:00]  It's okay, little guy.  I just want to pet you.  I was trying to be nice to him.  I want to pet you.  Look how cute you are.  Would you put your finger through the cage for a second?  I'll put my finger in the cage.  Don't.  No way.  I don't know what that would be.  He is cute, though.  Oh, oh.  He can put his little claws through the cage.  The raccoon's the second most vicious thing in this video.  He's like a snake.  He has rabies.  Oh, my God.  He's adorable.  He was adorable.  No way.  He's adorable.  He drowned the poor thing? 
[01:07:30]  No.  The trap guy came and took him.  No, they did.  Brought him to a wonderful place.  Upstate.  Did they say that, really?  Yeah.  I wonder if they do release him upstate.  What are you, crazy?  That cage goes in a 55-gallon drum of water until the bubbles stop.  Does it really?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't want to know, but I know one thing.  I didn't want him in my fucking attic.  No, they are bad to have in the house in the arcs.  They do bite.  They really do fuck you up.  Yeah.  You want neighbors had pet raccoon. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, I would love to hear how they...  I had two pet coons.  Raccoon ate baby's face up here.  That's in Michigan.  Probably had butter sauce on his face.  Raccoon brought his pets and worked with a vet.  Coon info.  Which one do you want?  Uh, just the one who had the pet or whatever.  It doesn't matter.  Neighbors.  Uh, there was one that said his grandma had a pet raccoon.  He couldn't stick around.  That was the one I actually wanted.  If you need to know.  Bill in Georgia.  What's up?  Oh, Bill.  Hello, boys. 
[01:08:30]  Hi.  Hey, when I was a kid, we had these, uh...  They were real weird people that lived next door, and one of the kids was a waterhead,  but they had a pet raccoon that lived in their house like a dog, and the first time we ever  went over there, this thing's sitting on the table, and they're feeding it fucking powdered  donuts with their breakfast.  It's having breakfast with them.  I think you gotta get them when they're really young.  When they're just...  Right.  I would try.  What the fuck?  I think it ended up biting them, and they got rid of it, but he lived there for a long  time.  He lived in their attic, and they just left the attic open, and he just crawled in and 
[01:09:00]  out like he belonged up there.  If I had a pet raccoon, I would get the teeth and the claws removed.  Give him a lot of cat, then.  There's a very cute one called Buddy the Pet Raccoon, and they're, like, showing...  Buddy the Pet Raccoon?  They took him to a park.  Look, he's so little.  He's punching out, boys.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  That's a little baby raccoon.  I had two pet coons.  Let's go to Todd and Caroline.  Is he gonna make a joke?  Good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Anthony. 
[01:09:30]  Shut up.  Yeah, well, I was in kindergarten.  My dad had raised two little raccoons, and my mom told me I used to actually walk one  on a leash.  Their names were Squeaky and Ralph.  Oh.  Well, that's adorable.  Squeaky and Ralph?  Squeaky and Ralph.  Oh, wow.  Is that real?  Uh-huh.  No.  It's not real.  It's a stuffed animal.  Oh, it's a little iRobot.  What?  No.  I have no idea what that is.  Uh, remember when the baby tigers came into the studio? 
[01:10:00]  I do, in 19, like, 2000 or whatever.  Yeah.  2001.  Long time ago.  There's pictures of us petting.  Yeah.  But they were hard to pet because, uh...  They were fucking...  Their paws were so strong, you were afraid they were just gonna claw you.  Yeah.  You'd pet one?  Yeah, those big fucking claws.  They were amazing, right?  I loved it.  It was, yeah.  I just remember...  That guy might have had problems afterwards.  Right.  I think it was that guy. 
[01:10:30]  I'm not sure, so I don't want to, like...  Yeah, then...  Speak out of turn.  I do know this much.  Wow.  He had a baby elephant outside.  Yeah.  And he wasn't allowed to bring the baby elephant up to the studio.  Can you imagine if they brought a baby elephant into that WNEW studio?  Oh, my goodness.  Remember?  Yes.  He said, hey, I got a baby elephant in the truck.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  I can imagine bringing one in here.  I know.  Come on in, E.  Let's try to think of a good one.  No, no, no, no.  Oh.  Oops, sorry.  We're watching a video, by the way, of a fucking tiger frolicking with two dogs in 
[01:11:00]  a garage.  He's playing.  Why would...  Why would...  DJ in the light bulb, you're just an idiot.  Uh-oh.  He's in it.  From Dallas.  He's a regular.  Holy shit, Jimmy.  I love you, but fuck you for mentioning that video.  I have a three-year-old son.  That was the most horrible thing I've ever seen.  What?  Don't watch it, Ope.  Of course not.  Then why...  If you have a three-year-old, why the fuck would you watch that?  The dog's trying to fuck the tiger.  It's like a fucking...  What kind of dog is that?  Like a Siberian husky?  Yeah, they look like huskies. 
[01:11:30]  Trying to fuck a tiger.  That's horny.  Yeah.  The tiger's like, I'm right, get out of here.  The tiger's not even fighting them.  It's like, I understand.  I guess how did the dog's trying to lick the tiger's asshole?  Yeah, tiger pussy has got to be...  You know how good tiger pussy has to be?  Where they don't even kill you for trying to fuck it?  They're like, we know, we know.  Tiger pussy must rule.  Of course you've got to smell it.  Yeah.  Oh.  Look how tired that little kitten is.  The kitten's sleepy.  It's a kitten just sitting there.  Eight million views.  Cutting off.  Eight point seven million views. 
[01:12:00]  Which means this is a fail.  This is an epic fail kitten video.  Oh yeah, come on.  Eric on Long Island.  What's up, buddy?  What's going on, man?  Hey.  How you guys doing?  Hi.  All right.  So my grandmother actually had a pet raccoon when I was a kid.  His name was Blueberry, and he loved to eat blueberries.  She found them in the wild real young, and he was great.  He was like one of the coolest pets we ever had.  Sorry, we're captivated.  Watching a dumb kitten video.  Which has 12.7 million views. 
[01:12:30]  His little fucking ears are all back.  It's Scottish Fold Munchkin.  And it's just, it's a little vicious little guy having some fun.  Why don't we just give the world kittens, and it would be a really nice place.  Would you pet a kitten right now?  Oh, in a second.  Oh, I would love to.  And I'm very allergic to it.  I would hold a kitten the whole show.  I haven't, like Don Corleone, I just kept thinking how he probably got cat hair all over  his black fucking tux.  I haven't petted a kitten in so long, but I would like to.  I want to do Kitten Day, man.  I don't know if I'd do Kitten Day, but I'd pet one for a few minutes and smack it. 
[01:13:00]  I think we could do Kitten Day and get a fucking YouTube sensation going.  Your kitten's in the studio just running around while we do the show.  Pissing.  I like when fucking Nicole brings her dog in.  That's cute.  That's a cute dog, yeah.  And her peanut butter.  I need to pet a kitten once in a while, for fuck's sake.  Are we done with raccoons because people are still calling?  Yeah, fuck them.  Rotten new things.  Stupid raccoons.  Oh, these interns.  Who are they?  Yeah, we got it.  It's new intern day.  Why?  Well, that's Sal.  Bunch of dunderheads.  The new guys. 
[01:13:30]  Did you see them this morning, though?  They walk up the hall in a gaggle, and then they stood outside the glass window here just  staring at us.  It's fucking uncomfortable.  Well, we are rock stars.  Well, yeah.  And then they opened the door.  You've got to remember that sometimes.  And tried to, like, come in here.  And you had to say, no, no, you could go in over there, find E-Rock.  Yeah, and then Sal told me that after that incident, he informed all three new interns,  you are never to enter that studio when any of those three men are in there. 
[01:14:00]  Ah, nice.  Put the fear of motherfuckers in them, guys.  And then E-Rock left and walked down the hallway with three of them in tow like a fucking mommy  goose and the little goslings.  What I noticed was E-Rock was slumped over, and the reason is because E-Rock hates the  fact that he has to be their boss.  He hates being the intern boss guy.  You don't like it, right, E-Rock?  It's all right.  No, you don't like it.  Don't lie to me.  He likes being looked up to. 
[01:14:30]  E-Rock likes being looked up to.  Yeah.  He likes it for the first couple days.  Yeah.  But then Travis and me were actually just talking about it in the office this morning.  The countdown when we get new interns is how long until they stop taking E-Rock seriously.  And that's when E-Rock doesn't like it anymore.  Do you think that they stop taking him seriously?  Yeah, very quickly.  Very quickly.  How old are these kids?  They look young.  They look like early 20s, yeah.  One's very handsome.  Is he handsome?  Very handsome.  Yep.  What do you mean?  He's a handsome guy.  Troy Kwan handsome?  Well, he's young. 
[01:15:00]  He's younger than Troy Kwan, but he looks like he got pulled out of an L.L. Bean catalog  or something.  He's very handsome.  Is this going to now put the pressure on Troy because he's kind of the older alpha male  around here?  He's certainly older.  Wow.  How old is this kid?  He's got to be in his early 20s.  He looks very young.  Troy may bring this young man under his tutelage.  His tutelage?  And show this young man how to take those good looks and go to the next level.  If the three interns are trying to figure out amongst themselves who's the handsome one. 
[01:15:30]  Who's the handsome?  Who does Sam think is handsome?  Do you think they could figure it out?  I would think so.  It's pretty obvious.  And then what about the other one that walked into the office this morning, I heard?  He didn't even introduce himself to any of the staff?  Me, Travis, and Danny were in the office doing our morning stuff, and one of the guys  just walked to the front door of the office and said,  Hey, where's E-Rog?  And Travis looked at him and goes,  Are you an intern? 
[01:16:00]  And the guy goes,  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Travis goes,  I think one of the other interns is up by the studio.  All right.  See, that's why these guys have to be hazed.  Yeah.  I go back to my fraternity days, man, because they need to be hazed.  Yeah.  Put in their place.  Yeah.  Ripped down to be built back up.  That's right.  They're taking it a little too far, but they absolutely need to be hazed.  Now we're not allowed to do anything with them, right?  Yeah.  No.  We used to get our best stuff from interns.  Can we talk to them on the air?  No.  Yeah, we can. 
[01:16:30]  You can talk to them on the air.  We can definitely talk to them.  Barely.  Yeah, we just can't have them whipping their dicks out.  Damn it.  I know.  If we can't kick them in the...  You could end this sentence there.  No kicking of them.  We're not allowed to kick them.  That's out.  Then why would you talk to them?  I don't know.  Find out where they're from.  Fuck that.  How excited they are to be here.  Get to know them a little bit.  Yeah.  I think it'd be great.  Get to know these studs.  Yeah.  I want to talk to the handsome one.  I want to bring all three in and figure out who thinks they're the handsome one. 
[01:17:00]  I would like to just to see before they know anything about this place, what they think,  what their expectations are.  Yeah.  Before they get jaded from fucking watching E-Rock.  Their first day here.  Yeah.  That's a...  You know, because it's a totally different vibe.  I agree.  I remember how excited I was my first day.  And they had to bring them back later, like, you know, later in their tenure here.  See what expectations they had.  And play back what they said and be like, ah, see, man.  They'd be like, fuck, man.  Yeah, what do you want out of this experience?  These are the new guys that just got to the NOM as replacements. 
[01:17:30]  And you gotta wait.  I hear you.  It's like stupid fucking rolling.  They'll develop a little gimmick that they won't realize is only going to last a week  before we realize what the real shit about them is.  Hey, I got Matt the intern at a gig with Brother Weiss.  Yeah, why?  I do good.  I do good work.  Why'd you help him of all the people?  Do you know how many interns...  I'm building bridges.  You know how many interns are pissed that you did that?  I know.  I love it.  All the old interns are pissed.  He's the worst, that guy.  He's the one you helped out.  He's perfect for Weiss. 
[01:18:00]  Is he doing well there?  I don't know.  I haven't asked.  I can't see how he does well anywhere.  Anywhere.  He was terrible here.  He was one of the worst.  I might have suggested something else to Weiss that didn't work out too well either.  What?  That was my suggestion.  You know, can't win them all.  Why don't we take a break, and then we'll figure out this internship.  I would like to meet them.  See who's going to be fucking...  Who's going to be working for this show? 
[01:18:30]  Yes, exactly.  Get to know them.  Before they're jaded.  I mean, Sal was an intern...  Sal!  ...a month ago, and now he's hired.  We could fire him and hire one of the new interns.  We didn't hire Sal yet, did we?  He's hired.  Oh.  Sal!  How long?  Probably about a month.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  What were you told?  I would think so.  He was better as an intern.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'd say as an employee, he's batting about .220.  He's lackluster as an employee.  He was a great intern.  He was an .800 intern and a fucking .220 with three runs batted in employee. 
[01:19:00]  Why does that happen?  Did he make the Roland angry fucking...  Was that him?  Who?  I made the record...  Don't get the panda angry?  Oh, Paul.  Oh, the panda.  Oh, that sucked.  Yeah.  Roland looks good.  Losing weight.  Yes, he is losing weight.  Yeah.  Let's take a break.  He-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM. 
[01:19:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Epic fail.  Ah, fail.  Fail.  Fail.  She's got to help, so I got to be...  Hold on.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, this is...  Getting topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With The Sex Man. 
[01:20:00]  E-Rock, just before we went on, I told Anthony, if you don't play Bob Dylan, you're a complete  failure.  Just want to let you know that.  Complete failure.  Huh?  The way you phrased it was so insulting, because what you said was, it's a fail if he does  it.  But when you told him to his face, you called him a complete failure.  Bob Dylan was down at the White House yesterday.  Why wouldn't you play some Dylan?  Pearl Jam.  You're a failure.  E?  All right.  Well, there you go. 
[01:20:30]  This isn't the same E-Rock I hear on the after show.  I know.  He's like, well, yeah, there you go.  And then on the after show, it's like, hey, well, let me do a break here with Sam.  I try to harbor an environment of positivity on the after show.  Shut up.  Where everybody feels comfortable to come in and just chat about whatever's on their mind.  Really?  Shit stir.  Good.  Hey, E, why the Pearl Jam?  Does it matter at this point?  Oh, man. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Whoa.  You want the new interns to see you acting like this?  Yeah.  I don't want to.  I could have played an example.  I could have played that dance for you if you wanted that.  Jesus.  Oh, wow.  That's a shot at us.  We're talking about an old movie, I think.  Is that a shot at us?  I'm not sure.  What's this one?  It's just a joint program.  Oh, God.  Why Pearl Jam?  I'm a big fan.  Big fan of Pearl Jam.  Why?  Well, if I'm a big fan, I would know, I guess. 
[01:21:30]  No.  Oh, good.  What's the name of the song?  How many years ago and what?  Seven years ago, Natalie Holloway disappeared.  That's when you're celebrating?  Oh, wait.  Where, oh, where has my baby been?  All right.  That's a little clever.  Yeah, all right.  Oh, and the Bat Dance came out 23 years ago?  Oh.  And we were just talking about Batman out of the blue?  How about that?  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  This was Prince, right?  This.  Oh, man.  This is bad. 
[01:22:00]  Prince, who wanted to be taken so seriously, and then he fucking puts this shit out.  Get the fuck out!  Ugh.  Go, go, go with the song.  This was when they started doing, like, pop artists started doing songs just for movies.  This is terrible.  Yeah, like, Vanilla Ice did Ninja rap.  MC Hammer did the Addams Family rap.  All right.  Bobby Brown did Ghostbusters 2.  Yeah, but MC Hammer, he just redid one of his songs, basically. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Give me the MC Hammer thing.  It sounds like fucking Hammer Time.  This is so bad.  No, he did the, he did, redid the theme.  They do what they want.  I know, but it made it sound like Hammer Time.  Yeah, this was a...  Stop.  There you go.  Hammer Time.  Hammer Time.  Sam's going to play it.  Just kidding, right?  Just kidding.  Just kidding.  I don't know.  This is so bad.  You're losing your head.  I mean, I'm losing my head.  Scenery.  Scenery.  Scenery. 
[01:23:00]  They do what they gonna do.  Say what they gonna say.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Oh, yeah.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  They play how they gonna play dance.  How they gonna dance.  They stop and pray.  Have a family.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm taking it.  MC Hammer's spinning in a big circle.  Yeah, he's on a wheel.  It's a good song. 
[01:23:30]  No, this song is terrible.  I don't mind this one as much as that dance.  That dance is fucking hard.  What year was this?  93.  Wow.  He's doing a hammer dance a little bit.  And here's a ninja rap.  How did that reality show work out for MC Hammer?  He came in to promote that.  Not great.  No one watched it.  Not great.  Wow.  You want to hear the ninja rap?  Oh, who doesn't?  Sure.  Little Ice?  It's from Secret of the Ooze. 
[01:24:00]  The Ninja Turtles sequel.  Oh, right.  One of the rarest instances where the sequel was better than the original.  Oh, you know.  Yeah, sure.  Go, go, ninja.  Go, ninja.  Go, go, go, go, go.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Fucking Little Ice.  This is the best.  Oh, man.  And then he's at the concert singing this song as if it's off the top of his head while the  Ninja Turtles are fighting Toka and Rezar. 
[01:24:30]  Sam, you're hilarious because you so thought this was cool when you were a kid.  The coolest.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  You were probably like, yeah, Ninja Turtles, this is cool.  Who didn't?  He just didn't want the world to know that he was a one-hit wonder, man.  New Jack.  Cool.  Look out.  You know, I'm not playing.  Never think you show what the hurdles are saying.  Wow.  This is old school.  Ninja.  Rap.  Ninja.  Ninja.  Rap.  Ninja.  Ninja.  Ninja.  Ninja.  Ninja.  Another guy just redoing his hit song. 
[01:25:00]  Kind of just putting a twist in it to make it sound like it's an original song.  That was good.  People are saying Pitbull's song from Men in Black 3 is awful.  Not people.  Steven Philly.  Really?  No.  Pitbull's all right, no?  Yeah.  You don't like Pitbull?  Oh, man.  No.  I don't care about him at all.  There's a disc from fucking Sam Roberts right there.  Is he the one with the tiny mustache that does the fucking beer commercial?  That's Hitler.  Oh.  Ball-headed guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what beer he's selling. 
[01:25:30]  Anytime you can bring up Hitler, it's hilarious.  I think this is officially like a hit, though.  They're playing this on Hits 1 and all that stuff.  Oh.  Morning Mashup playing it?  Oh, yeah.  Mashup's all about it.  What are they going to do, talk?  Of course not.  They're a fun show.  But can we kidnap Stanley and save him at least?  And let the rest of that show just fucking die?  You think Stan's the one?  I think Stan could be doing a lot more.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah, you baby.  Back.  You're cruey, baby.  You're mad. 
[01:26:00]  Let's make a movie, baby.  Time.  Excuse me, baby.  It's called Back in Time?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  You're cruey, baby.  You're mad.  Let's make a movie, baby.  Time.  Special Worldwide, A-G-A, reporting live from Cape Canaro, MK, Big Stack, that's rad.  Why does he sound like Jay-Z there?  I was just going to ask that.  He sounded like Jay-Z.  He's got the Dirty Dancing sample.  Yeah, sample and all of that.  He's sampling from another movie.  Yeah.  For a movie song.  Yeah. 
[01:26:30]  Whatever.  It's fine.  Back in Time, because the Men in Black go back in time.  How does the rap go?  Oh, we're going back in time.  We're not here.  We're going to be there or over there.  Yeah.  This is fine.  Oh, he's singing about the characters.  Oh, no.  Is he?  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to move back.  Yeah. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Miami Equals.  Black man.  Black clothes with a little bit of rock attack.  I flipped it.  Black suits.  White shirts.  Black clothes with a matching tag.  Like Agent J or Agent K.  You know, we're the whole world.  Okay.  It's not terrible.  It's pretty terrible.  No, it's okay.  What are you going to do?  Describing what they're wearing.  Agent J or Agent K.  Yeah, that rhymes.  Can someone get me that movie illegally?  That's one I'd want to see.  Maybe your doorman.  Yeah, that fucking doorman of yours.  That's been led away in cuffs. 
[01:27:30]  I heard him on the radio.  Did you hear that?  Of course I did.  He had the phone.  Jesus.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Yeah, what do you need?  Offering you illegal movies.  Shut up.  And you're broadcasting it to two countries.  That's just going for a bit.  Shut up.  Yeah.  It's probably just an actor.  Madonna.  You might as well do the Madonna thing.  She's finally taking a shot at Lady Gaga.  This could get ugly.  Is she?  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  Fuck you.  Yeah?  Fuck Madonna.  I thought they were all in one good, big, happy family.  Madonna's like, I've had it.  Because, what, Lady Gaga came out with Express Yourself or Born This Way?  Which one?  Born This Way.  Gaga.  Lady Gaga did Born This Way.  It sounded like Express Yourself.  And everyone said that, and Madonna finally took it on at a concert.  But, I think it's because Madonna's, like, you know, her album tank.  Boy, did it tank.  She's thinking like, hey, that Lady Gaga's taking my fucking audience. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, and, you know, Madonna's song sounds like bad romance.  None is the answer.  Oh, man.  Get the fuck out of here.  It's not like Born This Way is Gaga's biggest song.  Why are you defending Lady Gaga?  I like her.  She's great.  They don't need to defend her.  She wears her shirts.  She was born that way.  She stinks.  She doesn't stink.  She's amazing.  She's horrendous.  She's great singer.  She's not even close to her.  I'm in the Madonna camp.  Madonna was good?  She was, exactly.  Madonna was good.  Yeah.  Move over, Madge. 
[01:29:00]  Move the fuck over.  Say it to her face.  They start putting out complicated music.  Madonna just fucking put out pop songs.  What are you doing?  Just put out best ofs.  She's finished.  Wow.  Sam Roberts.  Goddamn, Sam.  That's vicious.  Well, maybe that's why Madonna's now taking shots at Lady Gaga.  She's very frustrated.  This is how it went down. 
[01:29:30]  What's going on here?  I don't have time.  That's the breakdown.  She's playing Express Yourself.  And then she starts singing the lyrics to Born This Way, back to Express Yourself, back  to Born This Way, as if to say.  It's the same fucking song.  Without saying.  Uh-huh.  Is our truck driving audience going to understand this break?  We just explained it to them, didn't we?  Is that a good one? 
[01:30:00]  Is that a good one?  Is that a good one?  That's a good one.  Come on.  Oh, come on.  Come on.  Come on.  I think Born This Way is a better song. 
[01:30:30]  It is a better song.  But Born This Way is a better fucking song than Express Yourself.  Really?  But the blueprint is Express Yourself.  Yeah, it was.  But again, Born This Way is more enjoyable.  Oh, Madonna's like, fuck you.  Fuck you. That's a fuck you.  Yeah, well, Madonna had...  It's not like Express Yourself didn't get played.  It's not like...  Of course it got played.  How else was Gaga going to rip it off?  It's definitely...  Is it passive-aggressive, though?  Yeah, it's passive-aggressive. 
[01:31:00]  She should say, hey, fuck you, Lady Gaga.  It's not aggressive-aggressive.  No.  It's passive-aggressive.  Very passive.  It is the same fucking song, though, right?  But it's not like Lady Gaga put the song out and Madonna's song was lost.  Like, she got 20 years of use out of her song.  Yeah, but then...  And then it inspired another great song.  But then Lady Gaga gets a hit by just changing the lyrics.  It was inspired.  It was instant.  The second I heard it, I was like, oh my god, that...  You didn't even have to think about it.  I didn't recognize it.  Point Jim.  I didn't recognize it at all from the stupid...  It's an old fact you don't know a lot of other genres of music. 
[01:31:30]  I'm not sure I know a lot about rap.  Express Yourself is a massive song.  Yeah.  It was inspired by...  It wasn't inspired.  It's not exactly the same.  This is better.  Born This Way is a better song.  I don't give a fuck, but it wasn't inspired.  It was ripped off.  It was the exact same song with different fucking words.  And Madonna has nothing to be mad about.  Lady Gaga didn't cost her anything.  How do you know?  She's not paying royalties to Madonna.  That pisses off artists.  Are you kidding me?  What's Madonna need the royalties for? 
[01:32:00]  Fucking raise that kid.  Yeah.  That lord who's already smoking and causing problems in the Madonna household.  No one's fault but Madonna's that her fucking album tanked.  No one told you to put it on sale with your fucking concert release just to try to get sales up.  Did you hear her song she sang at the Super Bowl?  It was terrible.  It was awful.  Horrible.  That's why her album tanked.  Because the biggest platform in the world, and she stunk on it.  Nicki Minaj is huge right now. 
[01:32:30]  And Madonna put her on a song and still couldn't sell it.  Nicki Minaj also stinks.  I used to like her.  I hate Nicki Minaj.  She stinks.  I mean...  We got it.  I heard you.  See, Jimmy does no music.  That's a perfect impression.  Shut up.  Eee.  Yuck a fucking room.  Boom.  You don't need so many words in your songs.  Yeah, I'm going to want my hand.  We got it. 
[01:33:00]  You're crazy.  Cartoony.  Fuck yourself.  Now we got to hear fucking Nicki Minaj.  So people...  The truck drivers understand what's going on.  It drives me nuts.  Truck drivers don't understand what's going on right now.  Find some.  Oh.  This is actually a good chorus.  Yeah, but then all of a sudden it gets silly.  Oh, you got to talk.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Why doesn't E-Rock want to play things loud? 
[01:33:30]  Because he's dumb.  Jeez.  Is it low in the mix or...  No, it's low.  It's really low.  What's wrong with this kid?  Maybe what Jim said.  Can't stop, because we're so high.  This is okay.  I won't say she stinks, but she's not good enough to be the cunt that people say she is.  Ah. 
[01:34:00]  At all.  Ah.  You're not Lady Gaga.  You're not...  Lady Gaga is good, man.  She's excellent.  I really like her.  It's tempting to not like her, because she's such a pop sensation, and her fans can be  a little irritating.  But you put on her music.  Fuck, man.  Speaks for itself.  Doug saying...  Would you fuck her, Jim?  I would.  I'd love her.  She was pretty hot in person.  I'm not going to lie.  She was great.  She's a star, man.  I thought she was kind of dog-ish, but then we saw her in person, and you know what?  She's not bad at all. 
[01:34:30]  This guy says that Lady Gaga rips off a lot of Madonna songs.  Oh?  Doug?  I'm going to relax.  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  I think you guys have covered this, but I mean...  What the fuck was that?  Oh, boy.  Alejandro was like a complete rip-off of La Bonita.  I don't know if you guys want to play those.  No, we don't.  There was a bunch...  I figured.  There was a bunch of them that were very similar.  I thought you guys kind of went over this a couple of months back.  We're busy.  Yeah, I mean, her first songs all sound like Madonna songs. 
[01:35:00]  Why don't we even take his call?  We don't care about her.  Well, she's obviously inspired by Madonna, but I think she'd probably tell you that.  Inspired.  Yeah.  She has said that.  Of course she's got to say that.  That's her defense.  But they're all...  Instead of saying, I ripped her off blatantly, you go, oh, I was inspired.  Why is everybody killing her?  And I know she's the...  Because it's too close is the problem.  Meaning, why are we...  I mean, I know it's been online, but why are we not just killing Zeppelin?  Like, they fucking blatantly stole, but nobody is questioning their integrity as a band,  and they out and out stole shit.  What are you talking about? 
[01:35:30]  You know.  That Spirit one is the best.  And see...  The Stairway to Heaven one is my favorite.  It's just inspired.  Oh, my God.  They stole shit from people who didn't get to have the hit with it.  They stole from smaller artists, not bigger artists.  Right.  So you think it's great if they have the hit already, and they steal it.  It's not costing Madonna anything.  No, man.  That's bad shit.  It's not bad shit at all.  No, man.  Fuck, musicians don't want...  It's 20 years later, and somebody gets inspired by the song.  Yeah, I agree.  They're going to court all the time.  Let them go to court, then.  John Fogarty had to fucking sue himself. 
[01:36:00]  That's how bad it gets.  I don't know what John Fogarty is.  He got so pissed at himself, he sued himself.  I know.  He's pissed.  That's how bad this shit gets.  Because he kept writing the same song.  One of my favorite stories.  Fogarty had to go to court because he sued himself.  I'm going to sue myself.  He's just angry.  Go sue everyone.  No.  Wait, how did that really go?  I'm so confused by that story.  I can't even remember.  CCR sued John Fogarty, but CCR is John Fogarty.  Right.  Right?  Right.  He sued as the band suing the person. 
[01:36:30]  Him as a solo artist had a song that was very similar to him in CCR.  So he had to sue himself.  And there's no CCR with John Fogarty.  Really.  I mean...  But why didn't you play Dylan, Iraq?  It comes back to you.  Yeah, why not?  Dylan was at the White House.  It was a big moment.  With Barack Hussein Obama.  Why do you have to do the Hussein part?  It's his middle name.  Come on.  That just shows hate.  It's his middle name.  We all learned yesterday that he's doing a very good job.  Bill Maher pointed that out to us. 
[01:37:00]  Thank God.  Thank you, Bill Maher.  It's about time someone stepped up and showed the world.  Well, Dylan could not give a flying fuck that he was at the White House and getting some kind of medal.  That's how fucking big Bob Dylan is.  He's bigger than any fucking president.  He don't give a fuck.  And what medal were they getting?  Medal of Honor.  No, Medal of Freedom is the highest civilian honor that could be bestowed.  But, again, this kind of works into the hero thing, if you ask me. 
[01:37:30]  By the way, I'm sure Dylan was impressed.  You can't be getting a medal by the president.  You should have seen him.  He patted Obama on the fucking shoulder.  He patted him.  And then he walked away.  And the whole time, Obama's gushing.  Was he?  Gushing at Dylan.  And Dylan's just kind of sitting there like, meh.  This is how big Bob Dylan is.  You might not like him, but, man, you can't deny how big he is.  Yeah, Dylan is one of the fucking...  He's one of the weirdest guys in music, I think.  I told you, man.  His radio show was amazing. 
[01:38:00]  I loved his fucking radio show.  Do you know he's a fan of mine, Bob Dylan?  Oh.  No, no one's going to believe that.  That was good.  Jimmy's mouth.  Jimmy's mouth went like this when he did that.  Bob Dylan?  You made liar act your mouth.  All right, here's the clip.  This is why E-Rock should have played...  Here's liar mouth.  Yeah.  Of course I do.  This is why E-Rock should have played Dylan.  It's a big clip today.  Yeah, yeah.  Go full screen, god damn you.  It's unique, gravelly power was redefining not just what music sounded like, but the message 
[01:38:30]  it carried and how it made people feel.  Today, everybody from Bruce Springsteen to Oze Bob, a debt of gratitude, there is not  a bigger giant in the history of American music.  Oh, bigger.  This is one of my favorite stories.  Oh, boy.  I don't like his stories.  An Ethiopian man came up to her and said, only in America can a refugee meet the Secretary  of State.  Would he do that?  And she replied, only in America can a refugee become the Secretary of State. 
[01:39:00]  First American to orbit the Earth.  John Glenn became...  Where the fuck is the Dylan thing?  This is like a whole montage of all the people...  Wow, John Glenn is looking like the attack of the 50-foot man guy.  Holy shit.  Second trip into space at age 77.  Damn.  What?  How did that go?  He was on the space shuttle.  The space shuttle.  Oh, yeah.  I forgot about that.  He reminds everybody, don't tell him he's lived a historic life.  He says, are living, he'll say.  Don't put it in past tense. 
[01:39:30]  He's still got...  Are living?  ...a lot of stuff going on.  Tony Morrison's prose...  Singular.  ...brings us that kind of moral and emotional intensity that few writers...  Oh, boy.  ...ever attempt.  From Song of Solomon to Beloved...  ...he looks like trouble.  Tony reaches us deeply using a tone that is...  That's got to be nice to get a medal for.  I want a medal for the president.  Why don't you have cat doo-doo on her hair?  Oh, my God.  It looks like a cat shit hair.  You're right about Bob Dylan, though, tapping on the shoulder.  Look at him.  He's Dylan.  Yeah, but that's not the clip we saw on TV this morning. 
[01:40:00]  I know.  Sam, you can never find the right clip.  Dylan is just standing there stoically, if that's a word.  And Obama's behind him, like, just laughing.  Yeah, he's like, fuck, this guy's not going to give me any respect, is he?  Nothing.  What year did Dylan start?  Like, 63?  I love the fact that Manny wouldn't put him on at the fucking Café Finjean, Manny.  Because he didn't think he was talented.  Someone said...  He might have missed the board on that one.  Yeah, and he laughed about it, too, what an ass he was.  Some guy goes, dude, I just Googled Obama, Bob Dylan, first video that came up. 
[01:40:30]  It's just...  That's what this video was.  What?  Oh.  Are you sure?  Joe and Obama was the first...  Yes.  No, no.  No.  Obama, Bob Dylan.  You know it's got to be different.  Obama, Bob Dylan.  Okay.  Obama, Bob Dylan.  Obama, Bob Dylan.  That's three words, and that would have taken longer, so that would have been the wrong  maybe when you get the right results.  Yeah, exactly.  Do as you're told.  Okay, and it's the same video.  No, it's not.  It's purple.  It's been selected.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It's the same shit.  Oh, boy.  I don't know what you're doing.  Oh, boy.  This asshole. 
[01:41:00]  Whatever.  Testing you in.  Take your word for it, though.  I know.  You ain't shit.  I am shit.  You ain't shit.  I am shit.  And Dylan didn't take his shades off?  Nothing.  That's right.  He didn't.  Nope.  I think you're supposed to do all that.  That's disrespectful.  I think you're supposed to take your shades off if you're in front of the president.  Generally speaking, yeah.  All right, let's see.  Watch.  This angle's different than what we saw saying.  Oh, God.  A commercial.  Bob Dylan started out singing other people's songs, but as he says, there came a point where 
[01:41:30]  I had to write what I wanted to say, because what I wanted to say, nobody else was writing.  Born in Hibbing, Minnesota.  Was that supposed to be a joke?  I don't know.  He says, wow.  Was that a joke?  No.  He's the worst.  Oh, okay.  No.  You sure?  A positive.  All right.  He paused like he was waiting for a reaction.  No, no.  I think he said what I was saying, nobody else was writing.  Maybe he wanted to.  We don't have to go back.  Fuck it.  Right.  You couldn't be a rebel.  It was too cold.  Oof.  Oof.  Bob moved to New York at age 90, by the time he was 23. 
[01:42:00]  Bob's voice, with its weight and its unique gravelly power, was redefining not just what  music sounded like, but the message it carried and how it made people feel.  How is this going to help the economy?  Today, everybody from Bruce Springsteen.  They have to.  The springing gas prices down?  Every president does this shit.  Come on.  You know that.  There is not a bigger giant in the history of American music.  Oh, bigger.  All these years later.  He's still tasting that sound.  You said that, right? 
[01:42:30]  He's still tasting a little bit of truth.  I'm an asshole.  He has some secret power.  Bob Dylan.  Come on, Bob.  Come on, Bob.  Watch this.  That's awesome.  He doesn't say anything?  No, watch.  He just stands there like a statue.  With a shade on.  Holy shit.  With a shade on.  He's got his shades on.  He's just rocking back and forth.  Then again, he is Bob Dylan.  I mean.  Just pats him on the shoulder.  Yeah.  It's okay.  Thanks, Chris. 
[01:43:00]  No handshake.  Just pats him.  He nods, too.  He does have to say, all right.  It goes back to his seat.  Yeah.  Where's the part where he was laughing behind him?  I don't know.  Oh, Sam.  You ain't shit.  I am shit.  Thank you for the middle.  I'm not a big Dylan fan.  Sorry.  You know, I've kind of become a bigger one.  Like, I never loved him, but I've become more of a fan of him.  I like Bob Dylan.  Yeah.  Fucking, uh, I like his version of fucking House of the Rising Sun more than the animals. 
[01:43:30]  He is a hell of a dude.  So why don't we play that going into break?  And it's rising or something.  Oh, Chip.  You don't need a weatherman to see which way the wind blows.  All you need is a hat to get knocked off or something, you know.  Like, throw it.  I got lactose.  Why don't we play a really long Bob Dylan song and go home?  Oh, God.  And go home.  It's 8-10.  What?  Fuck.  What about the interns?  We didn't talk to them.  Yeah.  We could do that before we get Mickey Ward at 9. 
[01:44:00]  Play some House of the Rising Sun going into break there, E-Rock.  Please.  Even though it's not going to like this.  It's quick though, right?  I like this a lot.  It's five and a half minutes.  Oh, it's quick.  See you in a few minutes.  There is a house down in New Orleans.  They call the Rising Sun and it's been the ruin of many poor girls and me. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, God, I'm a one.  My mother was a tailor.  She sold these new blue jeans. 
[01:45:00]  My sweet heart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans.  And the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk. 
[01:45:30]  And the only time he's satisfied is when he's on a trunk.  He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around. 
[01:46:00]  And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, tell my baby sister.  Not to do what I have done, but young, that house in New Orleans. 
[01:47:00]  Well, it's one foot on the playground and the other foot on the train. 
[01:47:30]  I'm going back to New Orleans. 
[01:48:00]  I'm going back to New Orleans.  My race has almost run.  I'm going back to end my life.  Down in the rising sun.  There is a house in New Orleans. 
[01:48:30]  They call the rising sun.  There is a house in New Orleans.  They call the rising sun.  The rising sun.  It's been a road of many poor girls.  And me, oh, God, I'm one. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, God, I'm one.  Oh, God, I'm one.  Oh, God, I'm one.  Oh, God.  Oh, God, I'm one.  Oh, God.  Oh, God, I'm one.  Oh, God.  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Man, that was a long break. 
[01:49:30]  We got Ice-T just hanging out by a computer for the last two and a half hours.  Yeah, he's just so weird.  He's chilling, yo.  He's just chilling and checking out his Twitter.  I walk by him, go to the bathroom, I'm like, I think that's Ice-T right there.  He's tweeting.  Kind of strange.  Jimmy's talking to him.  Yeah.  He's trying to become pals with Ice-T.  Jimmy loves celebrities.  He does.  He just, there's something that just, he goes crazy for celebrities. 
[01:50:00]  There's a difference between us and him because I walked by and went, oh, that's Ice-T.  And that was it.  I didn't even get out of my chair.  I didn't feel the need to say hi or anything.  And I like Ice-T.  He's been on our show.  I'm like, oh, Ice-T, checking his Twitter.  That's kind of cool to see.  And I walked by.  Jimmy's just finished the conversation with him.  There's a few celebrities that I'm like, you know, starstruck by.  Very few.  But, you know, I guess everybody's got that.  But then there are just people that just can't get enough of anybody. 
[01:50:30]  We're just discussing that.  Oh, we're discussing you love celebrities.  You know, I didn't realize I was gone for so long.  I actually like him.  I was having a, he, because him and his wife came to see me at Caroline.  So it's like, I kind of know him.  Oh, and I was, he was showing me his, normally I don't talk to celebrities like that.  I never stop and talk to celebrities like that.  I say hi, get a picture.  I'm going to be him.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  That is, that is true.  I never stand there.  But not talk.  No, no.  I understand that.  He needs to get the picture.  You're right.  But he's got to get the picture. 
[01:51:00]  Because, like, when McDowell came in here.  Malcolm.  Malcolm McDowell came in here.  He wanted to talk to you after you got him to sign stuff.  We captured it on video and all you cared about, the sign stuff and made sure it was secure.  Have a real conversation.  Because to me, I'll tell you why.  You were able to have a real conversation with him.  Yeah, you can have these little chats, but Ice-T.  You don't like those little chats?  I don't mind them if I have something to talk about.  Like, I saw him this morning.  I like him as a guy, so I said hi. 
[01:51:30]  And he's comfortable.  And then on the way, as I'm back in here, and then you said Ice-T is outside.  I'm like, I wanted to ask him about this Iceberg Slim.  Because Pimp is a great book.  He didn't write it, but he put it.  He pushed it forward.  He pushed it forward.  Got the attention of the people.  It's such an insight into being a pimp.  So I just stopped and said, when are they going to make Pimp a movie?  And he goes, no, we just did a documentary about it.  It's not out yet.  And then he starts talking about this documentary he's got in Sundance right now, which is what 
[01:52:00]  he's here promoting called The Art of Rap.  And I was just fucking watching the trailer with him and talking about all old school  rap guys.  And it looks really good.  Oh, that sounds like a movie I definitely would check out.  He's got every Dougie Fresh fucking, I mean, guys like, of course, Eminem and Kanye West.  But all these old school guys like KRS-One and anyone into rap from like the Melly Mel fucking  like early 80s rap.  Melly Mel?  Yeah.  Sugar Hill Gang?  I don't know.  But that wouldn't surprise me if they're in that.  Yeah.  Yo, Ice-T!  Sugar Hill Gang! 
[01:52:30]  But I was talking to his guy who was with him.  And I'm like, well, we didn't know you were in the building because we got Mickey Ward in.  And his guy goes, oh, no, we'll see if we can squeeze him in.  I'm like, we don't know what time Mickey Ward's in.  And he goes, all right, we'll bring him by right after.  So he might just come by.  I don't know.  But this actually looks really good.  And I was, he's got, you know, Ice-T has access to everybody.  So.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was, we were just talking about rap today.  I'm fucking very interested in this.  Yeah.  Some old school.  I love the old school guys.  I'm interested as to what happened to a lot of them. 
[01:53:00]  Like, well.  Because they weren't.  But he said a lot of, some of them are selling real estate and some of them are even.  Well, it's too short.  Yeah.  Who is he talking to in this movie?  Motherfucking too short.  But I was very interested to, uh, who is that Sam?  Oh boy, that guy's on drugs.  I was rapping back when rap was fucking rap.  Take pictures for people.  This is some of my purpose.  This is my perspective.  Say something with some dignity behind that.  I mean, you could consider Dr. Seuss, a rapper.  They think you're just talking over a record.  It's Q-Tips voice.  It's Snoop's swag and personality. 
[01:53:30]  What's your style?  My style, I would say, is Taekwondo.  Yeah, you do.  Taekwondo.  He's got everyone in this.  So nobody painted it off.  When you talk about hip-hop, we talk about the whole movement.  Let me tell you something.  Kanye.  That's Dougie Feige.  They go by way too fast, all the people that are in this film.  Damn.  Hip-hop.  So it's time to leave you a preview.  You see, maybe he is.  So you two can review what we do. 
[01:54:00]  Let's ask him.  Maybe he is enough.  Make yourself hungry.  That's just the way I do.  I'm a little bit tough in the studio, but everybody's happy once they come out of the booth.  Who's that?  I don't have no business where you're saying that.  That Dre motherfucker.  I don't want to get rich and die trying to.  I act like the mic cut off.  Is that Ice Cube talking Ice Cube?  Yeah.  Get those suckers off the stage.  Who's that?  Oh.  That's a public enemy guy.  That's what?  Oh, Chuck Deere.  I like public enemy guy.  That's fucking Karis.  One old school.  I'm H-I-P-H-O-P.  Freestyle. 
[01:54:30]  He was a weird rapper.  I got scared until he said the P part.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  All right.  Love is love.  Yeah.  That actually looks really good.  That was great, dude.  But I don't know why Jay-Z's.  Maybe he said no, or maybe he was away and couldn't do it.  But he got Eminem in it.  And 50 Cent, I didn't see either.  Or Rick Ross.  Was Rick Ross in that?  I didn't see him.  I don't know a lot of newer guys.  Oh, boy.  That means he has some beef for those people.  You think so?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, there's some beef going on.  East coast, west coast.  That's right.  You forget, though, because he's an actor on. 
[01:55:00]  That show.  Yeah.  That he was like a legitimate.  Before rapper, he was a fucking pimp and a fucking.  He was the guy.  Yeah, man.  He was a real.  He was a scary motherfucker back then.  Yes, he was.  One of my favorites is Chuck D.  Yeah, I like Chuck D.  Chuck D.  Public enemy.  I really liked growing up.  I didn't know shit about it.  Hey, are you a fan of Donald Trump?  Yeah, yeah.  On and off.  I'm a fan of his son.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Donald Trump Jr., I like him a lot. 
[01:55:30]  The Donald Jr., yes.  We've had Donald Trump on the show, and he's fun to talk to.  I woke up to a documentary about the Donald this morning.  Really?  It was on the TV when I woke up.  Yeah.  And then Donald Jr. was in there, too.  And he's talking.  I'm like, I just look up like, I know that guy.  Was he a little kid for this documentary?  No, no.  It's a newer documentary.  Kind of recent.  Huh.  Well, Donald Trump made some news yesterday, didn't he, now?  Oh.  He wants to know where Obama was born.  Do you think Obama was born in this country? 
[01:56:00]  I'll tell you one thing that came out, which makes it hard, was a-  Hard to what?  Believe that he was born in this country?  Yes.  An old thing from Harvard.  Oh, right.  Which was, when he was like the first black guy to, I think, be in charge of the Harvard  Law Review.  And it was, it listed his bio way back when he was at Harvard, and it said that he was  born in Kenya.  Yeah.  I think, look that up, Sam, Obama, Harvard, leaflet, or pamphlet.  It was done way back then. 
[01:56:30]  So I wouldn't be surprised if he wasn't born in this country.  So when did they do the switcheroo?  There it is.  Yeah, there it is.  It says, Barack Obama, this is his bio.  From back when he was at Harvard.  Barack Obama, the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review, was born in Kenya  and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii, the son, and that's all they show.  And that's put out by Harvard.  Harvard when he was there.  When he was there.  When he, say, looked at it.  And it was never corrected.  You need to correct that?  Yeah.  Wow, that's weird.  I personally, I know what the Constitution says, but I don't care if he's born here or 
[01:57:00]  not, to be real honest.  Well, that's a big deal, though.  It is, but I don't-  A president has to be born in America.  I get it, but I don't care.  That goes against the ABCs of what this country's about.  Well, the ABCs were all so fucking, it was all so built.  We have the Constitution, so I guess I don't care from Jim Norton doesn't really add up,  does it?  But we do make these amendments to the Constitution.  And look, when the Constitution was written- 
[01:57:30]  I think the president should be born in the United States.  That's to keep foreign influence out of the country.  Yeah, exactly.  But way back when, there was not the influx of, this was way before all of the immigrants  had come here.  And are you going to tell me, like, say you found out John McCain was born in Italy and  came here when he was seven or five.  Oh, that wop to stay out of fucking office.  Get back to the boat!  Yeah.  But it just doesn't matter to me if they're just born somewhere and then come here.  I don't give a fuck. 
[01:58:00]  Because let's say he was born here, and then went and spent, he still spent his childhood  in Indonesia, who gives a shit where he fell out of the vagina?  And that goes for anybody, I just don't care.  People think it affects their national pride, you know, you start thinking, you know, whether  you were, regardless of where you were raised, where you're born is where you're from.  You can't set a precedent and have your presidents be born somewhere else.  Why?  There might be other people who are born somewhere else that are very qualified.  Imagine if you could only be born here to be a governor. 
[01:58:30]  Like, I'm not saying Schwarzenegger was the greatest governor.  A fighter.  A Navy SEAL.  An asshole.  But it saved Schwarzenegger from Schwarzenegger from...  He wants to be president.  He wants to be president, but guess what?  He's not going to be.  Sorry.  Because he wasn't born here.  I don't care if Obama's born here or not.  It doesn't mean anything to me.  Wow, I'm surprised that wasn't corrected, though.  That's weird.  Yeah, a little odd, but I mean...  And they won't answer questions about him? 
[01:59:00]  No, no.  The people who worked with him there?  They won't release his fucking, like, his transcripts and shit from there.  Like, they're so secretive with a lot of his stuff.  It's just odd.  That is kind of weird.  Like, why won't they?  I think because there's some heavy-duty revolutionary writing that he did back in Harvard, which,  regardless, you know, who cares?  I don't care.  But, you know, let's see it.  But I bet there's a lot of stuff, probably some anti-American stuff, some anti-capitalism  stuff, that would come off looking very badly if it was released. 
[01:59:30]  When did they make the switch?  The switcheroo?  Where, you know, he started saying he was born in America when he was, you know, grooming  to be the president.  It had to happen a while ago, right?  I think it was during his Harvard days, right?  And then he said, wait a minute, I got a shot at the presidency.  I got to change that shit somehow.  I got to say I'm fucking born here.  Oh, man, there's some weird shit that happens in this country that you want to know about.  I don't like the fact that stuff is, everything he's ever done should be public record when  you're the president.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. 
[02:00:00]  But I don't care where he was born.  Personally, it means nothing to me.  The guy's going to call him, but I wouldn't care if he was a conservative.  I wouldn't care either.  Hey, do my bit.  What are they going to say?  Hey, Jimmy!  Hey, Jimmy!  You've got me!  Shut up!  I think we did get one already.  That was good.  Jimmy is proving what an asshole he is.  Obama thing was debunked.  Well said.  Let's go to Ethan real fast.  Ethan? 
[02:00:30]  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  Hey, no, all I'm saying is I heard on the news they were talking about the same story,  and it turned out when Obama was, like, the first black president of the Harvard Law  Review, he got a book deal from it, and it was some person from his publishing company  who made an assumption about that, wrote that thing, and then that same person's walked  it back.  So that's all I'm saying.  You can probably find that on the internet, too.  Okay.  All right.  Fair enough.  It's all on the internet.  If things add up, though, what are you going to do?  Well, Donald Trump, man, he knows how to get a sound bite. 
[02:01:00]  Wolf Blitzer loves this.  He really does.  I'll say this.  Trump bugged me because it's like, come on, who gives a shit about this?  I don't care who he endorses.  It's irrelevant to me what he thinks, but he knows how to get on TV.  That's what it is.  He's a publicity guy.  I love it because he's an entertainer.  I look at it as entertainment.  That's all I care about.  And he went at it with Wolf Blitzer, who's just a fucking blowhard with that dumb situation  rumor.  He's got a lot of TV screens there.  He sure does.  Yeah, bash him.  Oh, there's Wolf Blitzer talking about it now on the TV.  Ah. 
[02:01:30]  On the TV.  Oh, wait.  Here's the, you want to go with this clip instead?  Yeah.  Listen, listen to me, Donald.  Honolulu, can I ask, can I ask the question?  Donald, Donald, you're beginning to sound a little ridiculous.  I have to tell you.  No, I think you are, Wolf.  Oh, they kind of kept going at it for a little bit.  And earlier this morning, I spoke to Romney's surrogate, the former New Hampshire governor,  John Sununu.  He is such a warm and cuddly man.  First thing in the morning.  Here's what he had like a teddy bear. 
[02:02:00]  Right, Margaret.  But here's what he said.  How come someone doesn't say, Donald Trump is wrong?  And we're going to tell Donald Trump.  Donald Trump is wrong.  The president was born in the United States.  There it is.  I think that might be the first time.  Am I right?  Yes.  It's the first time that we have heard a surrogate say that Donald Trump is wrong.  Christine Pelosi is a former House...  Oh, my God.  Why wouldn't you play the whole clip, first of all?  It was great TV yesterday.  She placed 15 seconds on it.  Well, you can only play little pieces.  It's the news.  Soundbite.  He really needs to stop at the birth.  Who gives a fuck? 
[02:02:30]  It's fine.  Because it just gets under people's skin.  It does really get people angry.  But to me, it makes him look just ridiculous and stupid.  He's got his billions.  He don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah, he really loves just being in the public eye and knows what gets him in there.  Romney's got to, like, separate.  Where was he born?  Right.  He's doing his Donald Trump impression with his lips.  Yeah.  Romney's got to distance himself, huh?  No, Romney the asshole will stand there.  You know, it's what they do.  He doesn't really have to, though. 
[02:03:00]  I don't think he's taking him seriously.  All right.  He's, you know...  All right.  I mean, he knows Donald Trump is a kind of crazy fucking TV guy.  And I don't understand...  Here's the whole clip, by the way, because it's way better than what you just heard from...  The dumb news.  Yeah.  And I don't understand why you're doubling down on this birther issue after the state of Hawaii  formally says this is the illegitimate birth certificate.  He was born in Hawaii.  Why are you going through all of this, Donald?  Well, a lot of people don't agree with that birth certificate. 
[02:03:30]  But if the state of Hawaii authorizes it, if the state of Hawaii says this is official,  he was born in Hawaii, on this date, here it is, why do you deny that?  Can I stop for a second?  Yeah.  Wolf Blitzer's an asshole.  You're just assuming that everything was on the...  Right.  On the up and up.  You're a news guy.  You should be questioning everything, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Who wrote that?  Any deals between the guys in the White House?  You can't just dismiss it like that.  I think he was born in the United States. 
[02:04:00]  I think this is Trump's...  I think he was born in the United States myself.  He just doesn't want to look bad.  But Wolf Blitzer, just assuming what he saw is true, too.  I know.  What research has he done?  None.  Why do you deny that?  A lot of people do not think it was an authentic certificate.  How can you say that?  A lot of people know you won't report it, Wolf, but many people do not think it was authentic.  His mother was not in the hospital.  There were many other things that came out.  And frankly, if you would report it accurately, I think you'd probably get better ratings than you're getting, 
[02:04:30]  which are pretty small.  Donald, have you seen the actual newspaper announcements within days of his birth in Honolulu?  For example, the Honolulu Star Bulletin, we'll put it up there.  You see the birth announcement back in 1961.  The Honolulu...  Listen, listen to me, Donald.  Honolulu...  Can I ask the question?  Donald, Donald, you're beginning to sound a little ridiculous.  I have to tell you.  No, I think you are, Wolf.  Let me tell you something.  I think you sound ridiculous. 
[02:05:00]  And if you'd ask me a question and let me answer it...  Here's the question.  Did the conspiracy start in 1961 when the Honolulu Star Bulletin and the Honolulu Advertiser  contemporaneously published announcements that he was born in Hawaii?  That's right.  And many people put those announcements in because they wanted to get the benefits of being so-called born in this country.  Many people did it.  It was something that was done by many people, even if they weren't born in the country.  You know it, and so do I. 
[02:05:30]  So explain why, Donald, explain why...  So why did the state of Hawaii authorize that live birth certificate?  Why did they do it?  Are they part of this conspiracy as well?  Well, you know, your Democratic governor, who was the one that was really leading it, a lot of people say,  where did it come from, and they're saying, how come he didn't show it to John McCain, Hillary Clinton?  It was only Donald Trump that got him to do it.  So you know that, and I know that, and, you know, when you say that Obama doesn't mind this, Obama hates this subject. 
[02:06:00]  When his publisher comes out with a statement from him made in the 1990s that he was born in Kenya  and that he was raised in Indonesia and all of a sudden it comes out, I think it's something that he doesn't like at all.  See, the thing, the problem I have with Trump there is he's doing that thing that I hate,  which is a lot of people are saying, and then he's attacking Wolf's ratings.  Like, I get throwing jams at stupid Wolf.  But that's all diversionary to, like, why would they... 
[02:06:30]  And maybe Trump's right.  Maybe people did do it back then, and maybe they did put it in the paper to get the benefit.  But just because you're going, a lot of people did it, isn't...  Wolf is showing you, did the conspiracy start in 1961 when it was in the paper?  That's concrete.  Trump's going, many people did that.  A lot of people did that.  That's not solid.  Saying many people did that, and if you said that, more people would be watching you.  He's just throwing shit against the wall because he doesn't want to look stupid or like he's wrong. 
[02:07:00]  He ain't a politician.  That's true.  He's a fucking rich fucking builder guy.  Entertainer.  He loves TV and being on TV, so that's what he was doing.  The fact that Wolf was taking him seriously at all...  That's true.  ...is silly for Wolf.  Yeah, you're right.  Wolf should have just kept going, uh, Donald, you're silly.  I would have said you're flying and got the whole studio cracking up.  Right, Sammy?  No.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Piece of dog shit.  Wow.  You're a fucking birther.  Shut the fuck up. 
[02:07:30]  You shut the fuck up with your rust-colored pants.  You wore them yesterday, you piece of shit.  Whatever I want, you wore that shirt last night.  Fuck you.  No, I didn't.  It was dirty.  Cocksucker.  You're the only one here who sucked the cock.  Fuck you, cocksucker.  So what?  So what?  Nice shoes.  Chuck Taylor.  Hope you get fucking caught in an accident or something.  You just said so much.  Fucking piece of shit.  You just admitted that you sucked dick.  Hope your foot...  No, I did a couple times.  You did.  You said so much.  Hope your foot gets cut off by a fucking train, you piece of shit. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, really?  Yeah.  The only train I'm riding is the one that's on your mom.  My mom ain't no train lady.  My mom's a good woman.  She's Rubenesque.  Good in bed.  Rubenesque.  No, she's not good.  At least my mother doesn't bake cookies, you fucking cocksucker.  Oh.  She doesn't bake cookies.  That's right.  Your mother's a cookie baker.  And you know what that means?  What?  She sucks a lot of dicks.  Yeah, you would know about sucking dicks, wouldn't you?  Yes, I would.  I mean, I heard about it.  Troy in here so you can stare at something.  I ain't gonna stare at nothing with fucking Troy.  I don't care what color pants he's wearing or maybe the ruby red boxes today. 
[02:08:30]  Was he staring at Troy's fucking cock?  Every time Troy's in here, Chip's staring at his dick.  It's a fucking lie.  I don't look at Troy's fucking cock.  I don't care if it's always going to the left.  Don't mean nothing to me.  Fuck you.  Fucking cocksucker.  Wow.  Don't say shit to me.  Yeah, why don't you drink some Crystal Geyser water?  Then we'll see.  Yeah, we will.  Jesus.  Just thought of a good joke.  Why does Chip get so angry?  I'm not angry.  Oh, okay, Chip.  I'm glad.  He buries the anger. 
[02:09:00]  What's that?  Yeah.  He asked her.  From when he was a kid.  Yeah.  Watching his mom on the floor.  She fell and hurt herself and the guy was helping him up.  Oh, yeah.  She's like, Chipper, get out of those shrubs, Chipper.  What are you doing in there, Chipper?  Stop tugging on that, Chipper.  And I would start talking and go, Ma, what are you doing?  I seen the man helping you.  She'd say, Chipper, stop jibber jabbering.  You're jibber jabbering.  Chipper, stop it.  She would always say that to you?  Yeah, she'd say, go over there, go play in traffic or something.  And what were you tugging on? 
[02:09:30]  Nothing.  I was just there watching my mother get picked up because she fell on her back or something  and the guy was helping her.  But you said that she said, stop tugging on that, Chipper.  Yeah, she would say that.  Pull your pants up.  Quit tugging that.  Get out of the bushes, Chipper.  And don't you go jibber jabbering now.  Did Jesse Dixon help her up?  You made quite a bit of sport of me.  Quite a bit of sport.  Jesse Dixon would just tease him.  Jesse Dixon would tease him and then fucks his mom on the floor. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, it's a damaged womb.  Oh, boy.  Has anybody been watching the Hatfield?  Oh, no.  Why would I?  Well, apparently.  Is it good, actually?  Yeah.  That's the Kevin Costner thing?  Kevin Costner and.  Is he a Hatfield or a McCoy?  He is a Hatfield.  Are they the side to be on?  And Bill Paxton is a McCoy.  Is he really?  It's just so funny to watch him do anything.  Why didn't we get those guys?  Boy, that would be great.  That would have been nice.  I know. 
[02:10:30]  What makes the show so good?  I don't know.  Well, apparently it looks like a professional friggin' movie.  It doesn't look like a TV movie or anything.  The History Channel is playing it.  And what did they say?  It was the highest rated non-sports show on cable.  Wow.  Was this supposed to be a movie and they fell short so then they sold it to the History Channel?  I have no idea how this ends up on the History Channel.  When I saw the poster, I was assuming this was a movie coming out.  But oddly, you know, it does seem to have breaks in it for commercials. 
[02:11:00]  Like it does that little.  Well, maybe they have those moments where you could put a commercial in.  Maybe it started out as a movie and they realized there's no way we could cut this down to two and a half hours and said, fuck it.  Maybe.  What is it?  How many parts?  Was it like a miniseries?  Yeah.  It's the old school miniseries.  Three part miniseries.  Right.  Yeah, I kind of like it.  But, you know, I like the whole history thing.  Civil War kind of shit.  What was the problem with these two families?  I thought it was like one problem, but it seemed to be a lot of problems.  But who started? 
[02:11:30]  Like how long ago?  Well, the Kevin Costner Hatfield and the Bill Paxton McCoy were in the Civil War together.  And then the Hatfield decided he was going to desert and go back to his family.  And McCoy there, Bill Paxton, got captured and put in a POW camp by the Noleth and had, you know, lived pretty heinously as the Hatfield was getting into lumber business and with his family and kind of enjoying life. 
[02:12:00]  So there was some resentment there that he left.  And then there was a stolen pig.  And now they seem to be like these little things.  There was some shooting, killings.  One guy on the McCoy side went to the north instead of the south.  So one of the Hatfields, Tom Berringer, who is fucking really good in this, he plays like a fucking Civil War Barnes, is he kills the guy, murders him. 
[02:12:30]  So there's that kind of they're not sure he did it, but they think he did it kind of a thing.  There's just a lot of tension.  And then the last thing here that I saw on part one was, I guess, Bill Paxton's daughter got knocked up by one of the Hatfields' sons.  Yeah, Kevin Costner's son.  So what happens to those kids?  Well, yeah. 
[02:13:00]  We're going to find out?  That's what happens.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, part two is already over.  No, but what happened to the kids?  I don't know.  Oh, you don't know yet?  No.  Wasn't this in the Flintstones?  You know, I was thinking about how the Hatfields and McCoys have always been like this thing that was brought up years ago.  It kind of faded with time.  Like, you don't mention, like, oh, they fight like the Hatfields and McCoys.  No one really says that anymore.  I'm confused by the whole thing, because growing up, I assumed it was really just white trash, hillbilly-type shit. 
[02:13:30]  That's what it seems like.  But if the guy's going into the lumber business and stuff, he...  Well, the lumber business was pretty much him and a bunch of his fucking family cutting down trees on property they may or may not own.  Oh, I see.  And, yeah, doing shit like that.  Do they live next to each other?  Yeah, yeah.  They're all in the same kind of town.  No, but, like, on the Flintstones, I think, one lived up the hill and the other lived down the hill or something.  They were always shooting each other from two feet away over a fence, over a stone wall or something.  From their front porch.  Yeah.  Well, I'm going to get you, Hatfields.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what it was. 
[02:14:00]  Where'd I got you, McCoy?  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were always...  Maybe I should check this out.  Doing that.  It's an epic, you know.  It's one of those things.  I like Kevin Costner in movies.  He knows what he's doing, doesn't he?  Yeah, I like that.  And Bill Paxson's always just fun to watch.  I'm going to take care of my family.  Where are they at, these two families, at this point?  Ah, that would be interesting to find out.  I have no idea where the Hatfields and McCoys have ended up now and if they're palsy-walsy. 
[02:14:30]  I would have just moved.  Just moved, yeah.  I would have been the guy that just says, you know what, I'm going to fucking Cincinnati  or something.  Go somewhere else.  History Channel's milking it.  Yeah.  They're really milking it, though, with every show that's on the History Channel is doing  kind of Hatfield and McCoy promos and tie-ins.  You get, like, certain shows and they're like, yeah, well, it's like the Hatfields and McCoys. 
[02:15:00]  No one's brought that up in years.  Now, Chip found it funny.  Yeah.  How come it's not the shoe field?  Because the hats were glove fields.  No?  No.  I'm sorry, Chip.  God, I hope Mickey Ward's here.  Yeah, Pawn Stars had a Hatfield rifle on it.  Like, it's a tie-in.  And then some of the commercials they play were Hatfield and McCoy related.  I don't think you're going to bring them back as a trend.  Can I do this on demand? 
[02:15:30]  What are we up to?  I would think.  History Channel on demand.  What are we up to right now?  The third?  Tonight's the third.  Yeah, tonight's part three.  But you could probably get it, yeah.  And they play it ad nauseum.  What happened?  Where's your headphone?  Mic's off.  Can't hear you.  What?  I got to talk anyway.  Oh.  I got to tell you.  Oh, yeah.  They did a Family Feud episode.  Family Feud episode.  Did they?  What?  79.  Oh, fuck.  Now I got to turn your mic on.  You got my attention.  In 79, they had a Hatfields and McCoys.  Like, literally, they got members of the family to do an episode of the Family Feud. 
[02:16:00]  Wow, that's a real...  You see, they start shooting each other.  If you're on a TV show together, is it really a feud?  Yeah.  They played for a cash prize and a pig, which was kept on stage during the games.  Ah, for the pig that was stolen, and they finally settled up on that, huh?  The Hatfields one.  So, can we get a clip of this?  Oh, boy.  The Hatfields are the one that stole the fucking McCoys' pig, though.  Oh, no.  Did they steal the pig, or were they accused of stealing the pig, and they never did?  Accused of stealing the pig.  It looked like he had stolen the pig.  Did he?  But then one of the Hatfields was on the jury. 
[02:16:30]  They had six Hatfields and six McCoys on the jury.  And then one of the Hatfields was like, I don't know, you know, going with the evidence.  I got to say that he probably didn't steal the pig, but he probably did.  But then they, you know, he got off the hook.  The Hatfields and the Hatfields and the Hatfields and the McCoy family, Jimmy, Regina, Debbie,  Randy, and Kathy.  They're all dressed old school with guns.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck?  They got guns only in 1979. 
[02:17:00]  They're all coming out with guns.  Pointing at us now.  This is it, people.  On your mark, let's finish the Family Feud.  Ah, let's finish it.  Richard Dawson.  It's got to be, right?  Come on out, Richard.  It's got to be a Family Feud.  Richard Dawson.  I was just going to stop making out with the Hatfield and McCoy women.  Put your fucking guns down, you like it.  Wow.  Is he dead?  Oh, God. 
[02:17:30]  He's still alive.  Really?  There's the pig.  Pretty sure.  I'm going to make him feel at home.  Ray Collins is dead.  Green Acres is dead.  Everyone's charming motherfucking pig.  Welcome to day two.  That's Arnold on Green Acres.  It really is kind of fun.  He is fucking hammering.  The Hatfield and McCoy is fighting out.  Best out of five.  That's going to settle it.  He's a good host, though.  Get a lot of money, of course, so get the pig.  Now, you've got one game, right?  Yeah.  I'm going to forget as the days go by who's got what. 
[02:18:00]  Gene, how would I?  You give me something to remind me who.  How hard is it to remember best of five, stupid?  Yeah.  It's a gimmick, what do they bring up?  Dead body?  A dead body.  Thank you.  I've always wanted to work with Alex Trebek.  What's Palestine over here?  Oh, it's Canadian Mountie?  Oh, fine.  This is here, and this will mean they've won one game.  We'll just litter the stage eventually with bodies.  Oh, no, it's bodies.  Oh, my God.  This is, like, fucked up.  This is a game show. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, thank you, Gene.  You see, nobody gets a...  Where do we feed the chat?  All right, here we are, McCoy's Jimmy.  Jimmy's got on the Hatfield and McCoy promotional History Channel hat that Roland just brought in.  And it's like one of those, you know, kind of southern, almost cowboy-ish looking hat.  But it's got a bunch of holes in it.  Like it was shot through.  It looks like Sandy Cain's hat.  That fucking Family Feud. 
[02:19:00]  That was weird.  Guns, what?  Hatfield and McCoy.  Oh, my God.  Dinner Feud.  Dinner Feud.  Where is this?  Branson?  So this has gotten completely similar, this whole thing.  Oh, my God.  It's not even based on reality anymore.  Oh, wow, look at this.  This thing pulls down to keep your ears warm.  Oh, that looks good, Jimmy.  You should wear that.  Yeah, I feel like, look, it's Hatfield.  Because you're wearing a hat.  Yeah.  Where's my pig?  Someone took my fucking pig.  Hey, I bet you it's that McCoy guy. 
[02:19:30]  They're keeping him in that room by the board.  You hear that, fucking fatso?  Oh, shit.  Sorry.  Where is it?  It's in Pike County, Kentucky.  Keeping him in that room by the board.  Feudin', feastin', family fun.  Oh, we rock.  So, obviously, these two families aren't fighting anymore.  No, it doesn't seem like that.  Now it's just a joke for everybody. 
[02:20:00]  Back then it was a feud.  Now it's called murder.  Right.  It's like, you know, you can't quite get away with that.  Why don't we take a break so we can, like, sit up nice for Mickey Ward.  Nah, he's just single because he just checked in.  Oh, fuck.  All right.  Mickey Ward next.  His new book is called The Warrior's Heart.  The true story of life before and beyond the fighter.  The movie, obviously.  Most of us saw it, right?  Yes.  More than just a fight.  Great.  We'll talk to Mickey Ward next.  Welcome back to the radio program. 
[02:20:30]  It's Norton and Friends featuring my guest, Tony Cumia.  Hi.  And we have a young man of indistinguishable race setting up a camera.  That would be Sam Roberts.  And I'm waiting for a blonde guy with deep blue eyes to get back from the facilities and good abs.  I think he's in the bathroom doing some crunches to get his abs looking good. 
[02:21:00]  In the pisser?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we got, of course, Mickey Ward.  Who's not in.  Is going to be coming in.  Travis is walking down.  I heard he was in the building.  Maybe Mickey is up.  How long are you going to play the music for?  I'll kill everybody.  Where's Mickey?  What?  Why?  What do you mean we've been had?  What do you mean?  Who said that now? 
[02:21:30]  Roland?  Yeah.  Why did he say that?  Because he didn't know.  Because the publicist has the ability to check everybody in downstairs.  So when Roland gets an email that says Mickey Ward has checked in.  Oh, okay.  Mickey's not checked in.  It was actually the publicist checking everyone in.  Let's go back to break then.  That was fun.  So he's in route.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, there's my first question.  God damn it.  I had a good one, too.  Oh, what was that?  So, boxing.  What do you got? 
[02:22:00]  I'm looking forward to talking to them.  Boxing.  What?  You use those gloves, right?  Yeah.  What do you think?  You trained some fighters.  You did it.  What do you got?  Boxing.  What's that like?  Fun?  Yeah.  I shadow box.  Is that close to what you did?  Let's go.  Yeah.  What about the zombie, then?  Let's talk about the zombie.  I love that.  Oh, my God.  We got a new zombie.  We're not even over the first zombie.  We got a second zombie. 
[02:22:30]  I know this is news hysteria, by the way.  Because this shit probably has always been going on.  But now people are starting to go like, oh, what's going on?  And then the news reports more of it.  And people start thinking there's this thing going on when normally it just happened anyway.  You're right.  People are crazy.  They sometimes chew on other people's faces.  The news loves trends.  They love it.  So when there's one outrageous story, they find as many other ones as they can.  Especially when it gets people going like, do you think there's this zombie thing happening?  That homeless guy from fucking Miami is just goddamn creepy. 
[02:23:00]  But I see more of it on the news.  So it's, you know, this thing is taking off.  It's like, no, it's not.  Hackensack man stabbed himself and then threw intestines at officers.  That's great.  How do you do that?  I don't know.  That's pretty rough.  How do you do that?  I get the stabbing.  Then you're pulling your intestines out.  Then don't you have to cut your intestines off?  You probably cut them with his knife and then started heaving his own intestines.  The question is why, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  Some of them bath salts.  I don't need the why. 
[02:23:30]  I just need to know the how.  Oh, my God.  Like, how do you do that?  The man stabbed himself repeatedly in front of police and then threw his skin and intestines  at them.  He's in critical condition.  He's still alive.  Damn.  Got the call.  Had a knife.  Was threatening to hurt himself.  This guy named Wayne Carter.  When police arrived, they kicked in the door to his room, which had been blocked with furniture.  Carter was in the corner of the room.  Here we go.  Here's the good stuff.  With a knife in his hand.  And he stood up.  He yelled at police while stabbing himself all over his body. 
[02:24:00]  Officers noticed that his intestines were protruding from a wound in his abdomen.  Holy fuck.  Carter allegedly threw some of his skin and intestines at officers as they tried to enter  the room.  Wow.  How do you not have your arm just not do that?  How do you stab yourself repeatedly?  So you got to will yourself to do it.  Oh, my God.  That's crazy.  The officers ordered him to drop the 12-inch kitchen knife, but he didn't.  Carter is accused of swinging the knife at officers. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, that's all you need to do.  That's what he's accused of?  You can't blame him.  I mean, if you want to cut your own intestines out, anybody else is going to get it.  They pepper spray the guy.  I heard that didn't have much of an effect.  That must have hurt, like, in the open wound.  Once you're tossing your intestines, it's hard to sting someone's eyes.  Yeah.  Ow.  That hurts.  They retreated, the officers, and they got the SWAT team, and that's how they took him  out.  Wow.  Underwent surgery, and yeah, he's in the hospital in critical condition.  Now he's going to be all achy. 
[02:25:00]  It's going to hurt now.  They'll probably medicate him so he kind of regains some of his sanity.  He'll be like, what the fuck was I thinking?  You think?  Now life really sucks.  Boy, Mickey Ward got scrawny.  Oh, Travis.  Ah, that's Travis.  Why do we get tricked by the he has signed in thing over and over again?  Uh, because Roland likes lying to us.  It was an honest mistake.  Lying to us.  No, no, that was an honest mistake.  Roland is shit, but that was an honest mistake.  I was hanging with Roland a little bit yesterday because he was in the neighborhood, and he  told me a lie.  No, not a lie.  A rumor, I should say. 
[02:25:30]  Oh.  And I now have to ask him, is it a Roland rumor or is this a real rumor?  Because there's a drastic difference between.  What's the big difference there?  Uh, the Roland rumors never are true.  Oh, okay.  I mean, never.  Hey, did you hear?  And then regular rumors are about what?  What would you say?  50-50 is a good percentage?  Yeah.  But the Roland rumor never is true.  There, he, and he's only here till 9.30?  No.  We'll have him longer.  What happened?  Yeah, no, I mean, our, our time got, got pushed earlier. 
[02:26:00]  So whenever he gets here, we'll, we'll have our time.  Well, I'm going to fucking, I ain't staying past 9.50 today.  Well.  We got 8,000 papers to sign.  That's right.  Oh, you got to take time off for paper signing?  Yes, we do.  We deserve that right after all these years.  Fair enough.  Hey, uh, Sam.  Good to be here.  Yeah?  You know there's a difference between a regular rumor and a Roland rumor, right?  Hey, excuse me?  You just got back in studio.  Yes.  What's the difference between a Roland rumor and a regular rumor?  Well. 
[02:26:30]  A Roland rumor.  I, I don't know, a Roland rumor generally is, has a kernel of something in it.  Right.  But most of it is completely made up.  All right, there you go.  They're pretty close to what I said.  Sam's just that from the studio.  Roland told me a rumor yesterday.  And I said, is it a Roland rumor or a regular rumor?  I don't know what you mean to say.  Well, yeah, sometimes he also, like, sometimes he, I believe, he.  This is the rumor, by the way.  He makes up a situation that would happen in his head, and then he, he reports it as if 
[02:27:00]  it did happen.  Like, he'll say, he'll report something that actually did happen, and then he'll make up  a follow-up to it that would make sense.  That's the rumor.  I can't say it now.  Jesus.  We will eventually.  You know what a good way to.  I promise we will eventually.  A good way to figure out in your head if a Roland rumor is true or not is to use common  sense.  Yeah.  But now I just call him out.  I'm like, look, don't fuck with me.  We're kind of friends.  Is it a Roland rumor or a real rumor?  Now, where did he say, like, what was his contact on this rumor?  I think I, his contact on that, I think, was Nagel. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, God.  On this one?  Yeah, because I heard that from Nagel.  I heard it from Cramden.  Wait.  I heard that from Nagel.  Nagel, how do you know this one?  He heard it from.  Without saying what it is.  He heard it from a person who would know.  Why are you lost?  You started this thing, obviously.  How is he lost?  If he tells you who he heard it from, it'll be obvious.  But he heard it from a person who would know.  So.  Why don't you say it on the mic so everyone could hear it?  Iran.  The rumor that's going around that Roland hit me up with yesterday all started from you 
[02:28:00]  because you got from somebody, right?  Yeah.  Is your source reliable?  Yeah.  What's the rumor?  This.  I'm not going to be the one to say that shit.  Right.  So your source is reliable?  I have no reason not to.  I heard who his source is.  And if that's who his source is.  This is real?  If.  Oh, I hope not.  That's the source on that is a reliable source.  Wow.  People are hating us right now.  Well. 
[02:28:30]  Why would you say what it is?  It's a rumor.  Everything comes out eventually.  Maybe they're just saying it to something else.  Well, if people are talking about it around the office, well, people, I don't know, because  Nagel heard it from somebody and that's the direct.  Well, it's the rumor.  You know how many times he's been thrown under a bus?  He gets up every time.  How?  The bus doesn't.  How connected?  No, he's panicking.  We can't.  It's directly connected to Nagel.  The only people.  I can't.  But how connected to the situation is the person that Nagel talked to?  100% connected.  100% connected.  100% connected.  Write that name down?  1 to 10 in importance in that situation. 
[02:29:00]  Don't write.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Okay.  Wow.  That's one of the reasons.  And he told him?  Really?  Why would he tell him?  They're boys.  All right.  Are you guys bros?  Are you broing down?  They bro down a little bit.  Do you bro down with him?  We get along very well.  They bro down a little bit.  Why?  I don't get that.  So let's just say, is that situation bad?  Why would he hang out with Erod?  They're both fat.  It could go either way right now, but it's leaning towards... 
[02:29:30]  Get out of here.  Really?  Yeah.  That's sad.  It's terrible.  But yeah, the way to decipher...  My only strategy in dealing with Rowland...  So that wasn't a Rowland rumor yesterday?  No, but what will happen is he will get that source from Nagel,  and then he will add to it.  Oh.  Things that would make sense if they were true.  But they're just made up.  But he just makes it up.  So it could be or couldn't be.  More importantly, how does Nagel have the time to, you know, 
[02:30:00]  search out these rumors when he's collecting Legos?  Oh, no, Izzy.  Do you collect Legos, you fucking cunt?  You do?  Or is that just a bunch of Eggos around?  I've been waiting three hours to figure out how to bring this one up.  Listen.  Remember that 17-year-old girl, Jackie?  Yes.  I used to go out with...  She played with Legos.  Well, you know how...  You know the girl I had to take to pediatrics?  Remember my daughter?  Yeah, yeah.  She's three years old?  Yeah, she plays with Legos.  Yeah, she plays with Legos. 
[02:30:30]  No, it's good that you bring up kids.  You know how, like, some kids...  Wait, wait, wait.  Collecting Legos.  Don't give him a hard time.  I know why.  I know he has pocket money at all.  You know how some kids, like, they start collecting Legos,  and it just extends into their adult life?  Right.  This is not that case at all.  This is not what we're talking about.  I understand the temptation to get...  He just saw them and started liking them?  He started a new hobby.  In his new house?  Your wife gets a house, and you see all that space?  I could build Legos here?  What kind of Legos is he building?  It's not any Legos.  It's not just, like, he bought...  I bet you it's the Simpsons. 
[02:31:00]  No.  Wrestling.  No.  What kind of Legos you got, Iraq?  It's a space one.  It's probably a really complicated one.  It's a space one.  Oh, you get it.  Okay, okay.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Death Star.  Close.  Close.  Hold on.  Before we go there.  Millennium Falcon.  He got it!  He got it!  Yeah, I got it.  Millennium Falcon.  Yeah, you got the Millennium Falcon.  I got that one half built at my house because...  It's $140.  Jackie was playing with it.  Playing with it.  Let me see.  Playing with it.  How much did you say that was?  $140. 
[02:31:30]  That's not bad.  How many pieces?  That's the small one.  $1,254.  I want to do that now.  Who's got $140 to spend on Legos after buying a house?  Is that like building a 3D puzzle?  It's Legos.  That's the shitty small one.  But how do you do it?  I got the giant one that was discontinued.  Why was it discontinued?  It was too big.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  That's the one that...  It wasn't shelf space.  That's the one that he used to play with.  Yeah.  You got this one that's $2,700?  Well, now it is because it's discontinued.  No, it's $2,700 for a new one? 
[02:32:00]  Ultimate Collector's Millennium Falcon?  Is that the one?  How big is it?  Eric, are you totally jealous?  How many pieces?  Six.  Wing, wing, middle, wheel, wheel, window, doctor.  Why are you playing with Legos?  Or is this just a one and done?  This one's 5,000 pieces.  Wow.  Oh my God.  How big is that?  To answer that question, it's not a one and done.  He was on the Lego website in his office yesterday.  What are you looking at to buy next?  That's the one I am, motherfucker.  And I have a fucking ad at, too. 
[02:32:30]  What?  That's cool, but it's hard to find.  It's not cool.  Eric, you want the Death Star?  Wait, Ant, you got the big one?  How big is it?  The Death Star's too expensive.  It's fucking giant.  Death Star's $400.  How can we make fun of V-Rock if you're doing Legos, too?  I wasn't.  My 17-year-old chick was.  Do you still have it at your house?  Yeah.  Can I play with it?  Yeah.  I don't have a chicken.  I had to break your fucking Lego toy.  Just step on it.  Let's just throw it in the pool.  I would love to.  Let's just throw it in the pool.  Is it built?  Well, not totally. 
[02:33:00]  Whoa, the Death Star comes with a TIE fighter?  Why is it $400?  How many pieces?  I think that's another discontinued one.  You can still get it, but it's just ridiculously expensive.  All right, I want to throw it.  This one's 3,800 pieces.  The other one's five.  What's the biggest Lego piece?  Can we throw it out my window and see if it flies?  Eric, will the Millennium Falcon fly?  No, it will not fly.  Bring it in.  I want to throw it out my window.  I don't want to do that.  Fuck, man.  That one Millennium Falcon looks cool, though.  Oh, it's very cool.  They have the new...  Very complicated. 
[02:33:30]  I hope so.  The Super Starship, it's about five feet long.  It's 500 bucks.  Oh, wow.  Iraq's opening his arms wide.  Like when someone said, how big a hoagie do you want?  So now, I'm sorry.  Party hero.  Now, um...  By the way, people are really mad at the rumor thing, and I understand.  I would be...  If I was listening to the show, I'd be really pissed off at all of us.  Whatever.  When I officially hear the rumor, I'll say it on the air.  Or if any of us.  We gotta leave Iraq out of this one.  We just have to.  As soon as I hear the exact rumor from someone that's reliable, I absolutely will say it on 
[02:34:00]  the air.  I just can't throw them under the bus.  It's not fair.  I don't want to...  I don't want to say the same...  But it'll come out.  I promise you.  Because they are fucking pissed.  Yeah.  It will lead directly back to Iraq.  They're usually pissed when we're doing shitty radio, but...  When do we do shitty radio ever?  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Oh, you're kidding and I'm kidding.  Someone said something yesterday that was so goddamn good.  Thank you.  Yeah.  It was Jimmy Norton.  Someone said, I need a chick with Bindi Irwin daddy issues. 
[02:34:30]  Who's that?  That's the daughter of the crocodile hunter.  Bindi Irwin daddy issues.  Jesus.  Is Bindi looking hot these days?  No, she is one of the dopiest looking kids I've ever seen.  How old is she now?  She might be...  She's probably 13, 14.  She looks really silly.  Let me see it!  That is the largest Lego set ever.  Oh, that's probably...  How tall is that fucking thing?  18 stories. 
[02:35:00]  That fucking thing.  I would drive my car into that.  Oh, $799 is that bad.  Fuck that.  Why do you need that?  It's 5,900 pieces.  6,000 pieces.  Can we get back to you, Rock?  What are you buying next, D-Rock?  Where can I buy that?  Oh, my God.  You don't want that.  I want to play with Lego and build them and then break them.  No, you don't.  Lego store.  You would do this for two minutes and then...  No, I wouldn't.  I would like to have the new package and smell it and smell the booklet.  And he'd go, ah, and be like, ah, and knock it over.  Where's the fucking piece?  Yeah.  Yeah, I probably would.  It's only 16 inches high.  That stupid thing keeps coming apart.  The problem is it's fake Legos. 
[02:35:30]  I don't like that shit.  Manufacturer recommended age 14 to 20.  It's not 16 inches high.  It's 16 inches tall.  You've got to build something out of just Legos.  Square fucking Legos.  Thank you.  Make it work, motherfucker.  Make it.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  59.  I hate the fake Lego shit.  If you could take a regular Lego set and build something like that, I'd be impressed.  That's the impressive thing.  Take your square Legos and make something.  This is fake shit.  Right, because they have instructions and everything is shaped specifically right.  Some of these parts only go in one place.  Like get one of those big red boxes of Legos. 
[02:36:00]  And then build that.  Now build that shit.  And I would be impressed.  That's not fucking 5,000 pieces.  Eric, you got a challenge.  How big is it, Danny?  Is it being deceptive?  No, I don't think so.  You just don't understand how small some of these pieces are.  Like I've seen like that big fucking millennium.  There are some tiny pieces that go on there.  Oh my God, it's good.  I was so good at Legos.  Yeah, but I think you would lose your mind.  Like the instruction book is to put these things together.  Thank you.  It's like a dictionary.  We had Iraq in our crosshairs and now everyone's at the Legos.  But dude, I want to build a Lego monster. 
[02:36:30]  Legos are pretty cool, I guess.  What happened?  Who doesn't love a Lego?  We're totally justifying Iraq now.  Lego stores right across the street.  This start...  Where?  You start out with us.  Right next to the stage.  Jim's face just lit up.  Who doesn't want to go to the fucking Lego store?  You don't need another fucking habit.  Yes, I do.  Well, dude, you know how many fucking...  You know how many fucking...  Where has he been, Daddy?  I haven't seen him.  He's building Legos.  Maybe they've got a tranny Lego set.  You know what's very cool is that downtown Disney, they have a Lego store and they build  these giant...  Oh, yeah. 
[02:37:00]  Like...  I'm talking like giant Lego things.  Put it on us, they do that here.  No.  Giant Lego things.  They have a dragon coming out of the water.  The dragon in the water.  But they're not building it.  It was made to look like that.  No, that one's real fucking square Legos.  You sure?  Yes.  All right, fair enough.  They're all fucking lit up.  You know, Jimmy's never going to leave like Fifth Avenue now because now when he goes to  the Apple store, he's just going to pop into F.A.O. Schwartz and...  Oh, they have him in there.  That's right, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I always say F.A.O. Schwartz.  Why would you do that?  I just don't like to say those words. 
[02:37:30]  That's really annoying.  F.A.O. Schwartz?  Kevin from Connecticut, E-Rock also collects Eggo, so...  Oh, E-Rock.  So now you got this Millennium Falcon thing.  Yeah.  Are you building it in the basement?  When do you find time to build it?  I haven't started yet.  But I separated the pieces.  I think he has like a nice Coke float and builds a...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  An ice cream sundae.  He makes himself a Coke float.  Yeah, his Coke float is a beverage to go with his ice cream sundae.  A bunch of chips with that and treats around the table.  Yeah.  Starting his project. 
[02:38:00]  His wife is constantly complaining because she does the grocery shopping and he goes through  these cartons of ice cream and she goes, I just bought you ice cream.  And it's gone.  Has she had enough of your eating?  I don't eat ice cream, though.  Legos are all sticky.  Yeah.  Fucking grease on them and crumbs.  Yeah, there's fucking drops of like cranberry juice and delicious things on the fucking  brochure.  On the instruction booklet.  Puts it together and crumbs are crunching in between them.  One time he accidentally called his wife mom like he did in school for the teacher. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, that's embarrassing.  Yeah, mom.  I mean, Mrs.  And everyone would laugh at you.  I'd like to, as he's about to put the like three last pieces in his Millennium Falcon.  There's your boys there, right, Iraq?  There's your army.  There's your army of fucking...  Those guys go Lego shopping for them.  Yeah.  Get me that small corner piece, dammit.  Sex brigade.  Send them out for a sex brigade.  The sex brigade.  Ah, shit.  Ah, Legos.  Oh, man. 
[02:39:00]  Well, Iraq.  What's the next thing?  Don't bash them until you try them.  We all did when we were kids.  Who hasn't tried Legos, stupid?  I would have tried them when we were kids.  I would also love to know...  My kid has Legos.  I build dumb towers and they fall over.  I hate them.  How big is that Taj Mahal?  It's not good.  We already went over this.  We've done this.  It's 16 inches high.  Usually we wait a week before we do a bit again.  We don't wait five minutes.  No, but how big a round is it?  18 inches.  5,000 pieces?  Yes.  20 inches.  It's 25...  We did this.  ...by 18. 
[02:39:30]  And that's 15 pounds.  Wait, which one?  25 inches?  25 wide.  The Millennium Falcon?  No.  Taj Mahal?  I'm going to buy that.  Why?  Why wouldn't you?  I would like to know...  Because you're not going to do it.  Jimmy, please buy it and please post progress updates on your Twitter.  You should record pieces.  Yeah, record like you getting up there and doing it.  I'll do it in fucking two hours.  I'm a Lego master.  I would love to know what...  Can you do it in two hours?  Just separating the parts, he'd lose his fucking mind.  Where is this one?  How big a box is it?  It's huge. 
[02:40:00]  Is it?  You've got so many questions.  Please let me go and pick this up.  Yeah, it's a little boy question.  I want to know how big the box is.  I would love to see the box.  Well, can't you assume...  But I've got to get a table for it.  How big the box would it be?  I can't do it on my floor.  I've got to get a table for the fucking thing.  And I'll just look at it.  Go look at it.  It's Indian style on the floor.  That's exactly what I was picturing.  Indian style.  Why don't we get one for the studio and you can play with it here?  Oh, that would think we'd get smashed.  Yeah.  People would steal shit and throw it.  Yeah.  No, because you'd steal one piece just to drive the nuts.  Jimmy knows. 
[02:40:30]  Like post chess set.  Jimmy knows.  Where is my rook?  Hey, did anybody read what I Twittered?  Fucking interesting chess facts.  No.  Oh, God, no.  It was a great tweet.  Someone tweeted me that.  That's a cool thing, that Taj Mahal.  I would love to build that.  It's three.  The fucking instructions was three separate PDFs.  Oh, fuck.  But wait, let me see something.  That's 25 by 16.  How big is that?  I'm doing my hand like this, like this.  No. 
[02:41:00]  25 is about this.  Yeah, two feet wide.  16 is about that.  Yeah.  It's like.  It's not that big.  There you go.  That's not that fucking big.  24 inch.  Yeah, yeah.  But how deep back?  Oh, my God.  Why is he asking me questions?  Oh, 16 by 20?  I feel like I'm in third grade.  No, I need a fucking table or something.  You need a table.  He's going to build this.  I'm trying to figure out what void E-Rock is filling in with Legos, and Jimmy's too worried  about buying Legos for himself.  Right?  Why do you want Legos all of a sudden?  Because I want the biggest one. 
[02:41:30]  I want them.  Those are all small.  Of course he needs the biggest one.  Of course he does.  Look at the towers.  I've got to build those.  Yeah, that's just fucking tedious work.  They're calling you the Lego key.  I'm the Lego key.  I'm Lego-ing, motherfuckers.  Can you let Mickey Warden in, please?  He's just waiting up.  Uh-huh.  That was great, though, having to just buy fucking Lego kits for a girl.  It's nice.  What'd you buy?  I bought it the Millennium Falcon.  Oh, you bought that for?  Why don't you do the car one?  How come it's not complete, though? 
[02:42:00]  It's an incomplete.  That's an add-on.  What is?  No, it is.  That's how the hood turns out, because it's flat.  It's in steps.  Why don't they have the special Legos?  No, there's got to be a better way to do that.  That stinks.  That's dumb.  You've got to shave that shit down.  Yeah, but look at this fucking thing.  How come the Taj Mahal has stuff on it?  It's a different type, I guess.  Because they're special Legos, and that's why I think it's cheating.  Dude, I used to love Legos when I was a kid.  But if you get a regular Lego set and then build something cool, I'm impressed.  Yeah, that's impressive.  I want to get a fucking, like, that Taj Mahal one and display it in Showgirls, and when 
[02:42:30]  they look at it, just fucking hit them with a shoe and fuck them.  Oh, here's the time lapse.  Time lapse of the Lego Taj Mahal being built.  I was going to do that.  That's interesting.  All right, this could be good for you, isn't it?  Let's see how big it is.  Here's Eric's best friend.  This guy's got a cool hand Luke poster.  This guy rules.  He does it.  He's building a Taj Mahal Lego.  This is what we're planning.  I think we can figure out what this is.  How about you start building?  Yeah, do it.  It's time lapse. 
[02:43:00]  The description is how I spent my 34th birthday.  That's not that big a box.  No.  Oh, that's a good-sized Lego box.  But look at the table you're going to do.  And there's the table you're going to do.  Yeah, watching him open it, that's a good-sized Lego box.  Look at all the pieces, though.  That would be so much fun to open.  That would be fun to open.  Jimmy likes the thought of just opening the box.  Smelling the new Lego pieces and boxes.  And a lot of different bags with Legos in them, see?  Oh, he dumped all the bags out.  He's organizing everything.  Yes.  He's just organizing everything in fast motion. 
[02:43:30]  How much time do people have?  There he goes.  He's starting to fucking stick them on the...  Yeah.  He's really going fast, though.  I could never do it this quickly.  See, it's time lapse, Jimmy.  Oh.  Look at all those pieces.  They're all over the place.  That's a lot, dude.  You need cups.  Yeah, you need cups to put them in.  Oh, cups.  I never did cups.  Oh.  I always put them all over the place, guys.  Cups.  Cups.  How would you do this?  Why would you?  It's just a waste of time.  That's not something to do.  Listen to some music.  Look at all those fucking pieces.  How do you find the pieces? 
[02:44:00]  More pieces are showing up.  Where are the pieces coming from?  You can do so much more with your...  They're in the bags.  There's a lot.  Oh, wow.  Look at how nice that is.  The base.  It's good.  And he's building the towers.  Oh, the towers.  And then he adds them on at the end.  Are you noticing the sunlight changing?  Oh, God.  Oh, he's doing this in a row?  Yes.  He's been at it for a really long time.  Oh, he's making a cool video.  He's got 23,000 views.  The sun is coming through the window very differently now.  That means he's been at it a long fucking time.  Oh, yeah, overnight.  This guy's busy.  He's not making a cool video.  No.  Yeah, he is. 
[02:44:30]  There's nothing cool about this.  Oh, I didn't realize he did that in a row.  Oh, man.  Now it's the next day.  Wow.  No way.  I bet it took him like 18 hours.  What?  Look at the boat.  Oh, do we have...  What happened?  Tom, we've got Mickey Ward coming in.  I see he's outside.  He wants to stop in, but do we have time or do we have...  Do you like Legos?  Maybe he likes Legos.  How long before I can make you work?  I can't find out.  He likes pimping Legos.  Ice Q.  Ice T.  I mean, Ice T.  Holy shit.  I'll tell you why, though. 
[02:45:00]  I'll tell you why.  Oh, my God.  I'll tell you why.  I got a good reason, though.  Because I made a joke.  Oh, my God.  We know why.  He has a good...  Oh, my God.  He's playing that one.  Oh, my God.  He has a good reason.  He's white.  No, I have a good reason.  Let me at least do my good reason, and then you can call me out.  I mean, he's being Cuba friends, though.  That's good.  We saw the trailer of the movie.  We're very interested in this movie.  Thank you.  And I made the joke that Ice Cube is talking Ice-T.  Yes.  Yes, sir.  You know I know.  I know what it is. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I don't know what that happens every day.  Don't worry about it.  Oh, no shit, right?  No, it doesn't.  Who knows what...  No, no.  Every day I got a rhyme where I say, every day on the street, somebody calls me Cube.  I tell them that's my homeboy, but it's Ice-T, dude.  There you go.  We showed the trailer.  The trailer looks amazing.  I want to see this movie.  I didn't even know about this movie.  Well, you know, it's an indie.  And, you know, we shot it.  We just wanted to get it to Sundance.  We got to Sundance.  It got picked up, and it's getting a theatrical release. 
[02:46:00]  Wow.  But still, we don't have the money like Avengers, so we're going around promoting it word of mouth.  You know, we're letting all the critics see it first.  Right.  But they're going out promoting it.  You know, if your movie's whack, don't let the critics see it first.  Of course.  That's what happens.  Yeah, yeah.  But we're letting them see it first, and they're getting the people to come out and go see the movie.  So June 15th.  We noticed that Eminem wasn't in it?  He was.  No, who was it?  50 Cent?  Jay-Z wasn't in 50 Cent.  Oh, Jay-Z and Rick Ross.  50 Cent.  Yeah.  Well, what it is is that I just went to my address book, and I just called the people I know. 
[02:46:30]  You know, so it wasn't like I went out and said, oh, we got to get the big people.  Jay's traveling.  You know, he's having kids and stuff.  So we just weren't able to get everybody.  But at the end of it, I had 52 MCs and 20 people waiting to be filmed.  Wow.  So it just, you know.  You got plenty, obviously.  It's two hours.  Right.  So I tell people, if you don't see your favorite rapper, you'll see your favorite rapper's favorite rapper.  Right.  You know?  And it was just impossible to get everybody.  But I got a nice cross-section.  Kanye's in it. 
[02:47:00]  Nice.  You know, so I couldn't get Jay, but I got Kanye.  Everybody real receptive, though?  Like, when you gave them a call, they're probably like, hell yeah, man.  Well, you know, I called them and I said, I'm doing a film, but it's not about the money, the cars, the girls, the jewelry, the beef.  It's about the craft.  Like, how do you write rhymes?  And everybody was like, no one ever asked me that.  Right.  You know, so they wanted to go in and explain their art.  And I think because people listen to rap and they've seen us rap off the top of our heads, they think that's how it's all done.  But some of the stuff, I mean, most of it is written. 
[02:47:30]  Right.  It's thought out.  And you're dealing with people like Public Enemy and stuff like that.  It's very strategic how they lay out the lyrics.  So this is the first time it's ever been captured.  Did you know where all these guys were?  No.  You lost track?  I just had their phone number and I just called everybody up.  People were moving.  Like certain people, like say Ludacris, we're trying to call him.  He's like, I'm in Africa.  Right.  You know, and then I had a film come, the film crew comes from London, you know, that I got with them.  They were willing to put up some money to help me make the movie. 
[02:48:00]  So I'm still doing law and order, but I have to strategically put all three of us in the same place at the same time.  So say I'm trying to talk to Jim.  Jim's like, I got you.  I got you.  I'm in Philly right now.  And then I'm like, OK, well, my camera crew's here.  I'm here.  OK, right now I'm in Atlanta.  Right.  You know, so I'm trying to catch everybody.  It was it was logistically hard.  It took two years.  Do you know how great it would be, by the way, if in your film about rap, if half of it was you just interviewing me?  Do you know how annoyed people would be with just me telling boring suburban stories about how much I enjoyed Dana Dane? 
[02:48:30]  And hey, whatever happened to Big Daddy King just asking questions?  I don't know about that one.  That is bad.  Can you tell us one story of maybe one of the older guys that you got in contact with and you were surprised they were doing something different?  I mean, everybody got jobs.  I mean, you know, these guys are selling real estate and doing other kinds of things, working.  You got the bad thing about being a celebrity is that sometimes, you know, after that shot, the star goes out. 
[02:49:00]  You know, you have to people won't move over and do something else.  They hold on to that celebrity to their like sleeping on their mother's couch.  And they're just like, you know, I can't get a job.  I used to be this.  I respect people that keep their hustle going and say, hey, you know, I rapped 10 years ago.  Right now I'm doing this.  I owe money.  I'm making money.  So, you know, I ain't gonna put nobody on front street, but everybody was doing well.  You know, everybody was doing well and doing what they wanted to do.  Right.  You know, and that's what it was more about. 
[02:49:30]  Uh, once you talk to people from the old school, they have humility and they'll tell you the good stories.  They'll tell you the mistakes.  If you talk to only new school people, there's, there's two on top of their job.  They don't want to make, there's no mistakes.  Right.  There's no problem.  Trying to still keep an image.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Still keeping it.  But when you get older, you're like, oh man, that time I was so nervous.  I was scared.  You know, they can give you that.  And that's what's beautiful.  Any bitterness from some of these guys that didn't, because they didn't make the money back then, like they're making today?  I think, you know, I think that, that bitterness wears off real quick when you realize how lucky you were to even actually ever be in the game. 
[02:50:00]  You know, I think there's a bitterness to everything.  You know, if you were on radio and someone else was on there for a minute, you go, damn, man, that could have been my spot.  Then you get over it and say, man, you know what?  I'm not a sucker.  You know?  So that wasn't shown.  Nobody really was in that mode.  Everybody was this happy.  You know, they got the phone call and like, like one of the people, Grandmaster Kaz.  This guy, he wrote the, he wrote Rapper's Delight and never got his shine, you know? 
[02:50:30]  So I really featured on him in this film.  And since then, he's got a book deal, you know, people want to see him.  So it's one of those things where, you know, you just got to, you got to take it with a grain of sand and you just got to keep it moving.  Entertainment, everybody has their ups and downs.  What was the first rap song?  We tried to figure that out on our show one day.  It was Blondie.  No, really, really, though.  What was the first one that like put it sort of in the mainstream? 
[02:51:00]  Rapper's Delight.  It was Rapper's Delight.  By Sugar Hill.  Yeah, that was huge.  That was the biggest.  I mean, there were underground rap records prior to that, but that was like the first pop rap record.  The thing of it was in Rapper's Delight, you had three MCs and one was named Big Bang Hank.  And he actually took Grandmaster Kaz's rhymes.  He was a security guard at a place and he rhymed Grandmaster Kaz, who's the leader of the Cold Crush Brothers, an original old school rap group. 
[02:51:30]  And he actually said his rhyme.  He said, I'm the C-A-S-N, the O-V-A, and the rest is F-L-Y.  That's Casanova Fly.  So he not only took his rhyme, he rapped his name in the record.  But, you know, they say those who say don't know and those who know don't say.  That's all part of the game and you just keep it moving.  Yeah, I want to see this movie.  What started the whole, because back when I first started listening, I didn't know who the West Coast guys were at all.  What started the whole, was there a moment that started this whole weird conflict between the East?  The press did that. 
[02:52:00]  Was it the press?  The press did that.  You know, they much rather ask me a question about who I don't like.  It's like, it's not a day that somebody comes and doesn't put a mic in my face.  Even today, it's like, who don't you like?  Or who, you know, they love that.  So it was easy.  Because hip hop is very much like a sport.  It is a sport.  My DJ is better than you.  I can out-wrap you.  It has that element to it.  So it's easy to say, you're better than the East Coast or you're better than the West Coast.  And what happens is, you know, they keep fueling that fire until it turns into real beef. 
[02:52:30]  The problem is, say you got, me and you have beef, all right?  So Jim doesn't like me.  It's not us.  It's our fans.  Now, our fans will bump into each other someplace out in the street and they could end up in some real drama.  So I never was worried about, you know, even when I was talking mess about the cops, I was never worried about the cops.  I was worried about a cop lover, like some of my brothers.  Somebody decided they wanted to try to seek revenge on me for something that was a song.  But, you know, I think we've all learned that, you know, when they create those conflicts, don't push them too far. 
[02:53:00]  Because you can get ugly, especially with street kids and rappers.  You just push it too far and you're going to really ask somebody to get hurt.  You turn around with the cops?  I mean, you know what it is.  Or do you still drive 10 and 2?  Cops treat me the same way they did prior to the record.  If I run into that right cop, it's love.  If I run into that bad cop, he's going to prove to me I'm not special, you know? 
[02:53:30]  And that's basically, it's the roll of the dice with them cats.  You know, they just got too much power.  It's just the fact that if you do catch a bad one, you can end up in a bad situation.  You know what I'm saying?  It's not like catching a bad guy at the ice cream store.  And he just dropped the ice cream.  It's just a guy that has a gun.  He decides he wants to mess with you.  But you can get some food poisoning from some of those places.  They don't like you.  True.  You came up from, you were born in L.A.?  Yeah.  No, I was born in Newark, New Jersey.  Oh, I didn't know that.  And then what, did you move to the West Coast? 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, my mother and father passed when I was young, and I moved to L.A. to live with my father's sister.  And I mean, I was in junior high, so I didn't kick up any dust out here.  And I got my reputation in L.A.  And I've been back here for 14 years doing Law and Order.  Wow.  So, you know, full circle.  14 years already.  Wow.  Holy shit.  It is the 14th season.  That's crazy.  Wow, that went fast.  Yeah, and I only came on the show to do four episodes.  So, you know, 14 years in television.  Yeah.  That's a lifetime.  And I'm not ever quitting.  You know, Chris Maloney, I told him, I'm black. 
[02:54:30]  I will be on that show until it sinks and turns over.  We don't jump off ships that are still floating.  You'd be like De Niro at the end of Cape Fear just shouting out lines as they fucking...  Exactly.  I mean, check's clear.  Dick Wolf.  Thank God.  Yeah.  You got here early today.  We're walking to the bathroom.  I'm like, I think that's iced tea.  Almost did it again.  No.  We said hello outside.  I know, but I'm like, he's at the computer just on his Twitter just chilling.  Yeah, well, you know what it is. 
[02:55:00]  It's I'm on a promo tour right now.  The movie's the 15th.  So somebody got to get out here and push it, you know?  And I don't believe...  Why do the work if you're not going to promote it?  Right.  So I want to give myself every chance for this movie to be a success.  And this is a really important movie because there's a lot of people out there that want  to do documentaries and a lot of urban filmmakers that want to make it.  And they got to understand that if Hollywood, if the movie fails, then that hurts them when  they walk in with their movie.  They're like, well, yo, Ice's movie sucks.  So you're not going to make it. 
[02:55:30]  So, you know, when one wins, that gives that next person that chance to come through the  war.  So I'm just, you know, I really put my best foot forward when it comes to, you know,  promoting the stuff that I do.  Can we get a screener?  Huh?  Yeah, we'd love to see it.  Well, they're going to have a premiere out here on the 12th in New York.  So I make sure my man comes in here with some tickets.  Yeah, I'd love to check it out.  Can we go to the premiere?  We never get invited to premieres.  I would love to go to the premieres.  We're not that famous.  The premiere would be dope.  I mean, you'll be surprised when you see the film. 
[02:56:00]  The 12th.  Yeah, the 12th out here.  So I get my people to get you.  We're almost famous.  Almost.  You guys always show me a lot of respect.  And the thing of it is, I'm going to tell you the truth.  Recently, somebody hit me up and said, I just heard your Opie and Anthony replay.  I got new respect for you.  I'm like, I did that like a year ago.  Yeah, wow.  But they just heard it.  Yeah, yeah.  But you know.  Brand new to him.  Yeah, we replaced off.  And that is actually a very good impression of every one of our fans.  It was right down the middle.  So cool.  Let me tell you, dude. 
[02:56:30]  Hey, mom, they like me.  I'm cool with it.  I want to go to this premiere and meet some old school rappers.  We're going to go to this premiere or at least go to a screening.  I want to see this movie.  Yeah, I would like to meet these guys.  I wonder what happened to these guys.  I grew up with, I used to get high.  We listened to, you know.  Who was your guy again?  I loved a lot of those guys.  The one you mentioned on the show.  Big Daddy Kane.  Big Daddy Kane was one of the champions.  He was the guy who really changed.  Like, people seemed to rap.  And maybe it was just me being on the outside.  But people had a certain way of rhyming. 
[02:57:00]  And then you heard him come along.  And it was completely different than anybody.  It was almost like he took it to another level.  Yeah.  He changed it.  Yeah, that's what happens.  That's what happens.  You know, because everybody has to have a unique style.  And they'll just come in.  And Kane was, like you say, and he was hardcore.  He took it one step further.  You know, a lot of rappers, you know, it's verbal acrobatics.  A lot of rappers, it's content, you know.  I mean, one of the reasons I made the film now is because now a lot of rappers become very pop.  And kids are getting away with murder. 
[02:57:30]  They're not really even rhyming anymore.  You know, and I'm like, well, this is art form.  It has to have a degree of difficulty.  Or else, you know, that's why I call it.  Some people are stars.  Like, Michael Jordan's a star because it's something you can't do.  That's why you look up at it.  But when you make it so anyone can do it, you know, it's kind of like, all right, now there's no degree.  So I don't know if I really, you know, respect it.  So is it in trouble?  Where do you think it's heading?  I don't think it's necessarily in trouble.  I just think, you know, I wanted to hit a reset button and get people to understand where it came from. 
[02:58:00]  It's kind of like if I play jazz, but why wouldn't I want to learn about Miles Davis?  You know, it's like, why not?  You know, so you got kids right now that love it, but think the first rapper might have been Eminem.  They don't really know where Em got it from.  And when you hear him talk about how he listened to Tretch, and when he heard Tretch's record, his whole life ended because he thought, you know, it was so good.  When you hear this, you hear the emcees talking about it.  It's a very inspirational film.  We used to, like, Grandmaster Flash got in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
[02:58:30]  And rap is not rock, but he was a very influential.  Well, it should be the Music Hall of Fame.  I think so, too.  If they're going to put in rappers, you call it the Music Hall of Fame.  Well, in a way it is.  We call it rock, Quiet is Kept, because it's like, if you sing what everybody wants to hear, it's pop, right?  If you go popular.  But when you say, I don't care, I'm going against the grain, now you're rocking.  So we rocked the mic.  We rocked the house.  So in a way, early rock was done with pianos.  Then it became guitars. 
[02:59:00]  So rock is a state of mind.  You know, whatever guitars or whatever you use, it's a matter of how you're coming at the music.  So rappers are rock.  You know what?  Rock Box, Run DMC, King of Rock.  You know, there's a couple of the biggest rap songs of them.  Yeah, to mesh over with Aerosmith.  Yeah, yeah, that was huge.  Did you laugh at that?  Huh?  Did you laugh at that when that came down first?  Not really, because, see, we used to spin Aerosmith.  See, hip-hop, like, what we did was, with hip-hop, it started by cats spinning records, and they would play the breaks. 
[02:59:30]  Every record has a breakdown, and Aerosmith breaks, boom, da, boom, boom, da, boom, boom.  They would spin it, but the hip-hop kids didn't know where that came from, but it was a hot beat.  Wow.  Now, this is prior to actually having instrumental records, and we'd go in and we'd spin Black Sabbath.  Right, so we're spinning that.  So everybody, they're spinning Steve Miller Band, because we're looking for beat breaks. 
[03:00:00]  And then the DJ would say, well, I'm doing this so good.  Somebody tell them how great we are.  And that's the MC.  So the early rapper was always just to tell how great this DJ was.  So when Run DMC rapped over Walk This Way, we had been rapping over Walk This Way.  but didn't have Aerosmith be fly enough  to say we'll be in the video  and show it all  and hey truthfully that kind of  put Aerosmith back in the game  so love is love 
[03:00:30]  people always talk about sampling  but you don't sample something that's whack  you like it  so we were singing  over Steve Miller  I need to know where Steve  I mean everything  from all those  records I mean Big Beat with  Billy Squire  all those records  because we've got to remember before hip hop  there were no beats like that  so we had to get it from rock  or we would sample James Brown beats 
[03:01:00]  and all that stuff  but that's where it comes from  and also one last thing  the essence of hip hop is taking  something that may not  you thought was hip and making it hip  so for me to be able to say  yo this is that Hall and Oates break  and you don't know it  but I'm rhyming over it  and then  that's what makes it cool  but no one made fun of you  for knowing Hall and Oates?  no they don't make fun of me  I'm Ice too  I know  I'm not according to him  you're not  you don't get 
[03:01:30]  because everyone busts each other's balls  I just wonder  I'll tell you the truth  this is a good comment  thank you  white people  have a real weird concept  of how black people treat each other  like they think  oh Ice you a cop  they don't like you no more  I'm like no  I have a job  you know  they're like yo  you winning homie  you winning  and they think that  if I know about Black Sabbath  the Motley Crue  or if I know about  Mata Hoople  or whether 
[03:02:00]  Edgar Winter  or Neil Young  or any of that stuff  that's not cool  that makes me cooler  you know  anything I know  you don't know  that steps me up  white people are more surprised  that black people  know things  about things we like  like I'm always surprised  with black fans  like I'll get black guys  go walk up to me  and go I'm a fake fan  and I'm like really?  I don't know why  we're surprised  that black people know our stuff  but you gotta remember  our whole life  we grew up looking at white people  if we want to go to the movies  if we want a badass 
[03:02:30]  it's gotta be Charles Bronson  it's gotta be  you know  the Terminator  cause we don't have any  black gangsta stars  so we grew up  looking at Ozzy and Harriet  and Leave it to Beaver  that's all we had to see  so yeah  we're deep into white culture  we know all this stuff  you know  you guys gotta step your game up  stop calling me Ice Cube  you know  no it's all good  you'd be surprised  I can't believe I did this  no that's love  but it wasn't even that  it's like you did it  with such like  I was like 
[03:03:00]  yeah Ice Cube  you know I know  it's Ice Cube  yeah  I've been here before  it's love  that's the only reason  I'm messing with it  what do you got  on Biggie Smalls man  did you ever meet him?  yeah  what kind of guy was he?  he was a good guy man  you know he's a street cat  they found hip hop  his way out  he got good lyrics  and stuff  I mean you know  you just can get caught up  in this business  lots of ways  you know  and you know  when you get that star  and you start to roll  and you know  make some bad decisions  you know  I mean my big decision 
[03:03:30]  with Big was  you know  there was a situation  in LA with Pac  I mean why go to LA  right now  it's hot  right  you know it's hot  and you know  you gotta make those calls  at the right time  but Big was a great guy  and I you know  Pac in the same sense  was a great guy  but in a way  it was kind of like  they died for our sins  like after that happened  it just put up  everybody just  all of a sudden  you've seen the East Coast  and West Coast groups  trying to work together  and show that  this can't ever happen again  wow  you know 
[03:04:00]  but it's just you know  escalating the beef  and it has a lot to do  with the press  and everybody had  something to do with that  just keep pushing it  nothing's gonna happen  just keep pushing it  keep pushing it  keep pushing it  before you know  it's something terrible  happening  well it used to happen  in New York  between the DJs  I mean I remember  when Red Alert  and Marley Marl  would kind of go at it  back in the 80s  East Real Talk  they push it  they keep pushing it  and then something happens  so everybody kind of  falls back off that now  and that's a good thing  nobody needs to get hurt 
[03:04:30]  out of here  you know  yeah  how do you see  the perception of you  years ago  you asking me or I say  you  the perception of you  is like a  pretty scary guy  absolutely  and  do you see that  perception has changed  and is it you  that's changed  or do you think  people just see you  differently  I think people  really getting a better  look at me  it's kind of like  if I met  Clint Eastwood  I would think  he punched me  in the face  because you only  see in his movies  you only see in his work  but when you get  a chance to really 
[03:05:00]  meet him  it's a different person  or Charles Bronson  or somebody like that  if you only go off  my records  and my work  of course  I always play the heavy  I always play the tough guy  people always meet me  and say well Ice  you're cool  I go well you're not  my enemy  you know  so that other side  is available  if we were out  and we were in trouble  you'd be glad  I was there  because I have that  but you know  the guy that walks  around tough all the time  he's a sucker  he's got issues  you know  he's worrying about  what his perception is  if you're confident  in knowing how to  handle situations 
[03:05:30]  you don't really  have to project that  but of course  in music  that's what you want  on television  that's what you want  so nah  after Ice Love Coco  comes out  people are like  you're funny  I'm like yeah  I'm funny  I'm a nice guy  I think the most  dangerous people  are nice guys  that you're just  messing with  you know  can I curse  yeah please  that you're just  fucking with  no not that though  that's all  the normal guy  the normal guy 
[03:06:00]  that wants to be  left alone  and some reason  you're just  messing with him  you know  I've got a lot of  friends that are  really cool  and they go  oh he was mad  I'm like  he was mad  I've never seen  him mad  and that's how  I am  I'm a very  very cool  laid back  individual  you could give  one look though  and you know  see there it is  who wants to  mess with that  I mean I'm  an orphan  I don't have  any mothers  fathers  sisters  brothers  aunts  uncles  and I  I had to 
[03:06:30]  kind of  get a certain  energy to keep  people off me  to stay alive  like 50 Cent  said this ain't  how my mama  raised me  it's how the hood  made me  you know  this ain't  it's not  I don't want  to be like that  I'm as cool  as you'll let me  be  you have no  brothers and  sisters  that you know  of or  none  wow  yeah so when  you're put in  a situation  like that  you're going  to either  be a predator  or prey  right  you know  so a lot  of times  kids will be  predators  just out of  a defense  mechanism  they got  to act  tough 
[03:07:00]  to keep  you know  the other  cats  plus I'm  light-skinned  I got  light eyes  and my name  is Tracy  okay so I  got a nice  deck of cards  you know  what I'm  saying  so I  had to go  in I  had to lift  a little  weight  get my  weight up  I'm six  feet tall  I got to  put myself  in a position  that I'm  not just  going to be  pushed over  but that's  not really  who I want  to be  but who  raised you  then  did you  go from  home to  home  I went  from my  mother  passed when  I was in  third grade  my father  when I was  in the  seventh  I moved  to Los  Angeles  I lived  with my  aunt  I stayed 
[03:07:30]  in there  till I was  in the  twelfth  grade  when I  was 17  I moved  out  I've been  on my  own  ever since  I didn't  know all  that  and the  documentary  we have  to  plug it  though  it's called  the trailer  looks really  great  I really  want to  see it  the art  of rap  and it  comes out  June 15  and it's  in Sundance  this year  which is  just  huge  we blew  up in  Sundance  and if  you want  to see  the trailer  go to  theartofrap.com  and you can  follow me  on twitter  at final level  thank you  very much  looks great  man  good seeing  you again  thanks for  the support  did you 
[03:08:00]  talk to  Vanilla Ice  for the  movie  thanks Ice  T  see you soon  man  I feel like  you can take  this asshole  dude that was  I gotta hear  that again  it's almost  like when  Sam said  Adam Walls  it's  hey man  how you doing  how you doing  man  how are you  see ya  how you doing  good  good good  we're actually  on the air  we just 
[03:08:30]  god damn  Mickey Ward  in studio  yeah  you were late  so Ice  T was in  the building  so we just  brought him  in and  we're talking  about his  shooting the  shit with him  yeah if you want  sure  yeah why not  you got the  new book  A Warrior's  Heart  the true story  of life before  and beyond  the fighter  the fighter  was amazing  thanks a lot  I appreciate it  I assume you  know that  by now  did the movie  was it weird  seeing yourself  I mean you  watched yourself  fight but was  it weird seeing  somebody  even though you  know Mark  was it weird  seeing somebody  play you 
[03:09:00]  and behave  like you  and try to  be you  yeah I was  a little  different  I don't know  I wasn't  I don't think  I was that  quiet  you know  it almost  seemed like  I didn't open  my mouth  or anything  I opened my  mouth a lot  but it seemed  like I was  really quiet  I'm a quiet  guy but I'm  not that quiet  but Mark  honestly did a  great job  portraying me  he studied me  for a long time  I've known Mark  for a while  so he's known  me and he did  a good job  you know  I wasn't  like Dickie  jumping out  the windows  and doing  all that crazy  stuff 
[03:09:30]  you know  what I mean  but Mark  did a good job  when he studies  you does he  end up living  in your house  we've heard  that over the  years with  some of these  roles where  the actor  will actually  start living  with you  to pick up  those little  nuances  right  well what Mark  did was he  flew me and  Dickie out  to his house  and he has a  gym out back  and we lived  in his guest  house  for like  a few weeks  at a time  we went out  there like  three or four  times  and we  stood out  there  and he  studied me  Christian Bale  was there  at the time  too  and that's 
[03:10:00]  how they  asked us  questions  they hung  out with  us  and we  were really  close  you know  and that's  how I think  Christian  grabbed  Dickie's  role  like  unbelievably  you know  and he's  just  you know  outside of  Mark  Christian's  a great  great guy  and what a  method actor  he is  he really  got into  Dickie  and it  was incredible  to see him  how he  transformed himself  into my  brother  because  I mean  he  even on  the set  it's funny  when you  go to  like a  set  you see  people  act  and then  when they  get off  the set  they become  themselves  and they  just go  back to  their normal  life 
[03:10:30]  well  what Christian  what he  does  what Dickie  is  when he  got off  set  he'd go  back to  his trailer  and say  hi to you  and that  was it  and stay  in Dickie  mode  the whole  time  I think  he drove  his wife  nuts  he said  that he  was going  on the  house  acting like  Dickie  I don't  know if  he does  it all  the time  he must  but  he stood  in that  role  I guess  all the  time  and it's  incredible  that's  incredible  to do  he was 
[03:11:00]  accurate  as your  brother  he was  like  I thought  it was  spooky  because  from the  back  I didn't  know  if  it was  Dickie  or him  with it  because  they  shaved  the top  of his  head  a little  bit  with  Dickie  you got  the  picnic  area  up  there  you said  something  in the  book  about  Dickie  too  which  was  interesting  where  you said  after  the  Sugar Ray  Letter  fight  where  he  went  there  was  10  rounds  with  him  and  he  went  the  distance  with  him  which  was  amazing  as  an  accomplishment  but  you  thought  that  just  the  opposite  like  instead  of  feeling  really  devastated  about  it  he 
[03:11:30]  felt  almost  too  good  about  the  accomplishment  and  let  it  kind  of  like  you  said  he  stopped  after  that  as  opposed  to  right  he  I  don't  think  he  just  stopped  right  after  what  happened  was  I  don't  know  if  he  was  comfortable  with  just  going  to  10  rounds  or  he  was  happy  with  what  he  done  but  I  believe  that  if  he  capitalized  after  that  fight  then  he  would  have  done  something  you  know  what  I  mean  instead  he  went  back  to  doing  whatever  he  was  doing  I  don't  whatever  he  was  into  at  the  time  drinking  whatever  I  don't  think  he  was  into  drugs  at  that  time 
[03:12:00]  but  it  became  soon  after  that  it  started  but  you know  if he  just  stood  on the  straight  and  arrow  and  fought  regularly  after  that  I  think  he  would  have  done  something  but  he  went  back  and  started  drinking  and  you  know  what  happens  when  you  start  drinking  getting  that  depression  and  you  just  stay  out  you  get  out  of  it  and  you  start  finding  yourself  hanging  with  the  wrong  people  why  didn't  they  cover  I  know  you  said  they  were  mashing  things  together  like  in  the  movie  they  have  to  condense  things  and  Mark  Wahlberg  said 
[03:12:30]  look  we  have  to  get  your  whole  life  in  two  hours  but  they  didn't  cover  the  Gotti  fights  I  think  you  won  fight  what was  your  relationship  with  him  like  I  had  a  great  relationship  but  he  was  great  actually  when I  fought  him  I  didn't  know  him  I  just  knew  of  him  and  stuff  but  after  we  got  done  fighting  three  fights  I  became  very  close  with  him  and  we  became  good  friends  after 
[03:13:00]  I  trained  him  for  his  last  fight  of  his  life  and  stuff  like  that  we  became  really  close  I  talked  to  golf  tournaments  me  and  Chuck  Zeta  would  walk  him  into  the  ring  every  fight  before  the  fight  I  just  became  close  with  him  tragically  his  life  was  taken  short  I  was  reading  about  that  online  too  it  seems  like  there's  all  this  speculation  did  he  hang  himself  it 
[03:13:30]  seems  much  more  like  he  was  murdered  that's  what  they're  starting  to  say  right  well  supposedly  I  guess  they  said  that  she  didn't  do  it  and  he  just  wasn't  that  type  of  guy  I  don't  care  how  depressed  he  was  he  had  a  beautiful  daughter  and a  son  I  don't  think  he  did  it  I  don't  think  she  did  it  but  maybe  she  knows  something  maybe 
[03:14:00]  he  was  really  drunk  and  perhaps  somebody  else  was  involved  that's  a good  point  I  didn't  think  of  that  and  now  that  you're  out  of  boxing  how  hard  is  it  is  it  hard  fighting  no  not  at  all  honestly  it's  not  I  did  it  for  so  long  I  did  it  from  when I  was  seven  years  old  to  I  was  37  I  didn't  do  constantly  every  single  but I  fought  throughout  that  time  when I  was 
[03:14:30]  done  I  was  done  I  had  enough  of  all  the  stitches  and  the  concussions  and  this  and  that  my  hands  my  eye  surgeries  and  stuff  my  hand  I  had  enough  you  know  and  I  said  when  I  I  I  I  beat  a  tour  that  last  fight  I  was  still  done  I  don't  care  if  they  came  back  with  five  million  I  would  say  no  keep  it  because  what  good  am I  with  all  this  money  if  I'm  not  coherent  what  good  is  five  ten  twenty  hundred  million  if  you're  not  capable  of  speaking  if  you're  not  capable  of 
[03:15:00]  understanding  a  sentence  if  you  can't  say  we  spend  it  and  not  you  you'll  be  in  a  it's  not  worth  it  you  know  and  I  don't  mean  to  say  that  in  a  bad  way  I  mean  that's  just  how  I  am  I  gave  my  all  when  I  was 
[03:15:30]  in  your  mind  you  think  you  can  but  you  don't  want  to  let  that  limelight  go  I  didn't  what  do  you  do  now  besides  obviously  the  book  and  consulting  on  the  film  are you  training  fighters  or  are you  still  involved  in  I  have  a  boxing  gym 
[03:16:00]  back  in  our  north  in  Chemsit  actually  it's  in  a  fitness  Mickey  Watt  boxing  I  I'm  part  of  an  outdoor  deck  hockey  with  the  ball  and  I'm  also  a  team  stuff  for  local  25  out of  Boston  on  the  movie  division  when  the  movies  happen  I  drive  and  stuff  that  doesn't  feel  like  being  in  the  limelight  in  the  spotlight  isn't  it  harder  to  come  back  to  a  regular  9  to  5  no  no  I  liked  it  I  like  it  better  I  don't  like  all  that 
[03:16:30]  stuff  really  I  don't  care  about  that  and  you  still  keep  in  shape  obviously  so  I  run  two  marathons  since I  retired  I  train  almost  every  day  so  not  like  I  did  when  I  fought  but  you  know  I  still  I  guess  that  was  a  chore  training  for a  fight  that  seems  to me  like  it's  just  all  encompassing  it's  everything  you have  to  think  about  every  second  of  every  day  when  you're  training  for  a  fight  almost  definitely  it's  funny  people  say  how many 
[03:17:00]  hours  physically  three to  four hours  tops  physically  but  in your  mind  even when  you're  eating  I'm  talking  to  you  you're  thinking  about  it  when  you're  eating  when  you're  going to  the bathroom  you're  thinking  about  it  when  you're  eating  taking a  shower  you're  thinking  about  so  it's  in  your  mind  24-7  only time  it's  not  in your  mind  is  when  you're  sleeping  pretty  much  unless  you're  dreaming  about  which  I  never  did  that  no 
[03:17:30]  you  never  had  bad  boxing  dreams  no  I  don't  remember  a dream  I have  in the  last  10  years  oh  really  were you  a guy  like  now that  you're  out of  are there  people  who don't  know  who you  are  or don't  know  that  you  fought  that  ever  give  you  a  problem  in  civilian  life  now  never  got  it  once  I  never  got  it  once  because  I  get  along  with  everybody  I  I'm  kind  of a  happy  go  lucky  guy  until  get  me  going  but  I  get  along  with  everybody  I  don't  look  for  trouble  I  don't 
[03:18:00]  start  trouble  and stuff  like that  I don't  go on  no more  anyway  have you  always been  like that  or in your  younger days  when you're  young  when you're  18  19  you get  a little  chip  on your  not a  chip  on your  shoulder  I'm not  a punk  but  I'm not  loud  I'm like  5'8  how loud  am I  going to  be  what was  your weight  when you  fought  140  see I'm  168  right now  I'm trying  to get  down  to 150  I'm  doing  weight  watching  a couple  men  talking  about  physical  fitness  where's 
[03:18:30]  the other  man  you're  not  quite  I  understood  it  but  I'm  trying  to  drop  a few  pounds  and  Keith  Robinson  some  comedians  I know  are going  to the  boxing  gym  and they're  working  out  I was  hitting  the heavy  bag  for a  while  I just  had to  stop  the  bag  that he  just  bought  from  McDonald's  but  in your  book  you talk  about  those guys  that will  use  the gel  gloves  and that's  what I  was using  but they  would slip  and hurt  my knuckles  you are 
[03:19:00]  so not  a man  tender hands  I don't  know how  to wrap  my hands  I want  to wrap  them  and start  hitting  the heavy  bag  again  I should  have  brought  a  rapid  you could  have  showed  me  how  to do  it  for you  can I  ask  about  your  nephew  that was  just  featured  on  real  sports  with  Bryant  Gumbel  he wasn't  in the  movie  they kind  of blew  him off  his story  is pretty  amazing  too  his story 
[03:19:30]  is incredibly  amazing  he's an  inspiration  to everybody  in my gym  it's funny  because he  picks everybody  up  the way  that kid  works  explain for  the people  that don't  know  Ray was born  with CP  cerebral palsy  he can't  really walk  good  before we  did the  boxing  stuff  and working  out  he never  really  walked  he'd crawl  walk  and walk  a few  feet  stop  you have  to sit  but through  boxing  he walks  now  he can't  walk  I can't  say he  can walk  a mile  or whatever  maybe he can 
[03:20:00]  I don't know  but he's never  really  he walks  in a treadmill  fight  20 minutes  at a time  so I mean  he probably  can walk  a mile  but through  boxing  he never  could even  stand up  but then  he tried  it one  day  and he  stood up  in the  ring  and he  couldn't  walk  across  or anything  and he  couldn't  throw  punches  as he  walked  because  his mind  his brain  wouldn't  allow him  to use  his hands  and his  legs  at the  same time  you know  what I mean  get that  functioning  going  so the  next day  he tried  a little  more  and before 
[03:20:30]  you know  it  he was  walking  around  throwing  punches  now he  does  on a  Saturday  we do  12 rounds  with 30  second rest  nonstop  he goes  around the  ring  throwing  punches  for 12  rounds  with a  30 second  rest  on a  Saturday  it's  like  what  inspiration  that is  for  the guys  in the  gym  that start  getting  tired  and they  look over  at him  he don't  stop  he does  probably  a thousand  crunches  a day  over that  he's a  maniac  you gotta  slow him  down  in the  movie  if you've  seen him  he was  a little  heavy  right 
[03:21:00]  right now  he's  like  140  something  pounds  he was  190  pounds  then  yeah  Brian  did a  great job  featuring  your  nephew  really  a great  job  and he's  like a  coach  now  or  something  is he  still  doing  that  coaching  basketball  for the  kids  at the  boys  and girls  club  trying to  help  kids  stay  you know  he tries  to keep  on the  straight  and narrow  and he  knows  his brain  is so  sharp  he knows  fighters  from back  years ago 
[03:21:30]  all he does  is watch  boxing tapes  every  VHS  whatever  I gave  him like  about  10 or  12  one time  of all  my fights  when he  came back  to me  they were  all broke  he washed  them so  much  they broke  them all  I had to  get all  new ones  he like  wore them  out  he washed  them so  much  he wore  them out  they snapped  who was your  guy when you  were growing  up  you looked  up to your  brother I know  who was a 
[03:22:00]  fighter  who else  did you  look up  to  I don't  know  I really  didn't  watch  boxing  all that  much  I liked  baseball  and football  and wrestling  I wrestled  when I was  a Yankee  fan  Red Sox  I liked  honestly  people back  in my area  back home  they say  who's your  second best  team  I say  the Yankees  because I  love the  Yankees  but I'm a  Boston  Boston is my  team  since I was  a kid  but if the  Boston don't  want it  I like the  Yankees  doing it  oh really  people can't  understand that  but I think 
[03:22:30]  personally  they're a great  organization  they're a great  team  so I mean  why should I  hate them  because of  New York  I don't care  a lot of  people don't  think like  that  that's for  sure  Yankees  suck  Yankees  alright  that's because  he got his  aggression out  though  those are all  like anyone  who's that  in a sport  your aggression  was gotten out  because you  were just  fucking  punched  knocked  you know  when you're  punching people  it's kind of  hard to get  all hyped up  over the  fucking  bunch of  guys  swinging  at balls  you know  you get  your  aggression  out  right  probably  a lot  of them  people  don't have 
[03:23:00]  aggression  and they  hate  him  too  so  are you  are you  a calm  or a crazy  driver  or are you  if a guy  cuts you  off  are you  a maniac  yeah  oh you  are  in my  car  if you  have  a camera  in my  car  you'd  probably  put me  in jail  oh really  I'm the same  way  oh I'm  terrible  I gotta get  bad  but I mean  controlled  but I mean  I don't  know  there's just  too many  idiots  out there  love  god  get out  of the  left lane  move  jeez  your car  can fit  through there  go  what are you 
[03:23:30]  waiting for  I know  oh it's  infuriating  hey your  brother  is your  brother  doing well  Max  I know he  went to jail  at one point  is he  doing better  now  yeah he's  doing a lot  better  he actually  just had  back surgery  not too  long ago  so he's  having problems  with one of  the screws  that were in  his back  he has two  rods in his  back  and one of  the screws  is pinching  a nerve  in his foot  making his  foot dead  so he's  having problems  with that  right now  but he'll  be back in  the gym  after that  and hopefully  he just  picks up  where he  left off  but he's 
[03:24:00]  sober  and stuff  and he's  not  well I think  he has some  beers here  and there  but he's  not  he is  not  to the  extreme  that he  was  and whether  that's a good  thing or a bad  thing I don't  know but  we'll see  but you know  he's not  I can't say  he's straight  and narrow  but he's  nothing  believe me  I'll tell you  I'm not  gonna tell you  he ain't  I mean  he is  if he ain't  either way  but he's  not  not where  it was  not at all  how accurately  was your mom  portrayed  because she seemed  like a  kind of  you know  it was  she was  like a  hard woman  who was  kind of 
[03:24:30]  pushing you  was that  was that  just kind of  the way the  movie did  or was that  pretty accurate  no it was  accurate in a lot  of ways  but she  never pushed  me into  anything  she never  see they  had in a  movie about  me  hearing  Dickie  like  making  almost made  look like  they made  me take  that fight  you know  with the  kid that  was heavier  they didn't  want me to  take that  fight  they said  no you're  not fighting  I said  I am  fighting  I don't  care who  says I  ain't  because I  was in  shape  I had  a bunch  of people  coming down  from Lowell  watching me  on the  buses 
[03:25:00]  and stuff  I couldn't  let them  down  you know  what I mean  so I said  I can't  let them  down  I gotta  fight  and I  wanted to  I was in  shape  I didn't  care how  big he  was  I felt  if I was  in a good  enough  shape  I'd be  able to  win  and  like a  mistake  that was  but I  thought I'd  win  but that  was on  me  it wasn't  on them  was the  hand  breaking  I heard  that's  hard for  you to  watch  the  hand  breaking  you see  in the  film  oh wow  I can  still see  it  well I  got  three  what  happened  was  that  incident  it was  like a  fracture  in there  and then  from  never 
[03:25:30]  healing  properly  I let it  heal for a  little bit  and then I  used it  too fast  so what  happened  is it  formed a  bone  deficiency  in there  where  the bone  was like  rotting away  on its  own  that's  why it  kept  hurting  so they  had to  take a  bone  out of  my  pelvis  and  put  in my  the bone  out of  there  put  three  screws  in  and  it's  fine  now  and  there's  a great  photo of  you in  the book  too  I was looking  at the  pictures  of you  way back  in 83  with a  bunch of  guys  and Mike  Tyson  a young 
[03:26:00]  Mike  Tyson  was that  was obviously  in the  custom  auto days  it was  it was  well it  was  Cuss  yep  exactly  him  Kevin  Mooney  at the  time  yeah  he was  I actually  fought for  New England  and won  New England  and then we  went to  up in  upstate  New York  in Lake  Placid  we fought  in Lake  Placid  for region  one  and one  of those  go to  the nationals  in Colorado  Springs  and me  and Mike  I won  139  and Mike  won heavyweight 
[03:26:30]  who was heavyweight  how much  was that  I think at the  time it was  201  well it is 201  he fought  201  and he  represented  we both  ended up  losing out  in the  national  but we  represented  New England  well not  New England  but region  one  so  could you  tell back  then that  this guy  was the  phenom  that he  was at  that age  yeah you  could tell  he had  that fire  in him  he was  he was  tough  he was  very tough  he was  he was a  great  he was a  student of  the game  too though  he really  studied the  game  and I  know all  the stuff  that happened 
[03:27:00]  after but  I don't  think that's  the real  Mike Tyson  that was  just all  he's a  good  to me  he's a  really good  guy  he's a  really good  person  well you  know him  for 30  years  yeah I've  known him  I don't  know him  like I  don't  call him  and talk  to him  and all  that but  he doesn't  even realize  he realizes  but he  doesn't realize  why all  these people  always own  him  he's like  Mickey  does he  remember you  oh yeah  he remembers  me 
[03:27:30]  but he's  got his  own life  he's doing  all his  things  so it's  hard to  sit there  and talk  for a long  time with  him  anyways  because so  many people  jump on  his back  and Mike  Mike  Mike  Mike  they shuffle  him right  off  wow man  yeah  that's gotta  be  it's tough  on him  even to  this day  he doesn't  have it  no wonder  why sometimes  he flips  out  I'd flip  out too  people just  keep  always wanting  him  it gets  difficult  but I've 
[03:28:00]  found that  oh Jimmy  oh my goodness  Jimmy  do you watch  UFC  or are you  still just  watching boxing  I watch  UFC  I've been  to UFC  I actually  trained a  couple guys  not for  the UFC  but MMA  I like  this sport  Dana White  I know  Dana a little  bit  he's a  pretty good  guy  I like  MMA  it's tough  it's a tough  sport  you gotta worry 
[03:28:30]  about not  just hands  you gotta worry  about kicks  and elbows  knees  and everything  else  that's brutal  that's the part  the boxers  always seem to  be amazed  with  the ground  stuff  there's no  one better  than a boxer  just standing  up there  throwing  punches  but then  it's like  you're set  I don't know  why I'm  explaining  everybody  kind of  understand  how you  get thrown  on the ground  somebody grabs  your fucking  leg  I'm acting  like I just  created this  the book is  called The Warrior's  Heart  are you doing  any signings  I know that  you are doing  something tonight  and I may  even have it  here  have you done 
[03:29:00]  any yet  yeah I've  done I  did a couple  already  we did one  in New Jersey  last night  I don't know  if I have  information  on a signing  but it's  Mickey's life  story  and Mark  Wahlberg  writes the  forward  I haven't  read the  whole thing  but I have  read pieces  of and it  was great  what I was  reading  because it's  like the  movie  but you learn  more about  the movie  some things  go deeper  you know  yeah  oh yeah  which you know  and it's good  to get the  things that were  incorrect  straightened out  you know  right  so 
[03:29:30]  cool  thank you  very much  Mickey Ward  yeah true story  of life before  and after the  fighter  Mickey Ward  thanks man  thank you  I think we're  done too  we're done  for the day  too  so I guess  we'll see you  tomorrow  yeah so go  fuck your  sons  bye  the only  Anthony show  is pretty much  over  but if you feel  like sticking  around  after ONA  live  is next  seven  seven  you </pre>
