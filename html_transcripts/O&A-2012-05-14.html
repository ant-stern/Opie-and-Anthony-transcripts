<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of Anthony's absence due to illness (possibly pertussis), the late notice given to Opie and Jimmy, and the ensuing demand for a doctor's note from management.  This sparked considerable criticism from Opie and Jimmy regarding the lack of time to secure a replacement guest.  Opie then recounted details of his son's birthday party, mentioning guests Rich Voss and Jim Norton, and sharing humorous anecdotes, including his son falling asleep and Norton's less-than-respectful treatment of Opie's furniture.  The conversation segued into Opie's apartment's layout, its excessive bathrooms and foyer, and the financial realities of comedy specials, including comparisons of Comedy Central and HBO pay rates,  and the impact of Louis C.K. on the industry.  Further party anecdotes and discussion of Broadway shows, including "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying," ensued, punctuated by a humorous observation about Opie's unexpectedly attractive mother-in-law. The segment concluded with reflections on the hosts' personal lives, relationships, and the changing dynamics within their friend group as members married and had children.

The show continued with Opie and Jimmy, joined later by a caller, discussing relationships, aging, and mortality. Jimmy detailed his recent breakup, anxieties about marriage, and the impact of fatherhood on his perspective.  Opie shared similar sentiments about aging and societal pressures.  A significant portion focused on the recent death of their friend Patrice O'Neal and a new article about him, contrasted with their experiences with friends' deaths from drug use and AIDS.  Opie then shared a bizarre anecdote about being aroused by his son's birthday balloons, leading to a humorous exchange with Jimmy and a caller.  The discussion touched upon a helium shortage,  the Patrice O'Neal article, a New Yorker article on Osama Bin Laden's death (including detailed discussion of the raid), and advice for Jimmy's CPAP machine, concluding with Frank Sinatra's "Summer Wind."

The next segment began with a discussion of the killing of Osama bin Laden, focusing on WikiLeaks, the New York Times, and the political ramifications of the raid. The hosts debated whether any president would have authorized the operation and discussed a detail about using a doctor to obtain Bin Laden's DNA.  One host mentioned speaking with someone who dined with Admiral McRaven, describing the operation as "ballsy." The conversation then shifted to a Newsweek or Time magazine cover depicting Obama with a rainbow halo, sparking debate about its interpretation and political implications.  The discussion then abruptly pivoted to the hosts' sexual preferences, centering on Opie's attraction to breast-shaped balloons, leading to a lengthy and explicit discussion of sexual fantasies, featuring calls from listeners with similar unusual fixations and participation from a therapist caller, Steve.  This was followed by further discussion of the Obama magazine cover and reports on New Yorkers' reactions, brief mentions of the Avengers movie and a national math competition.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about the challenges faced by blind individuals, using humorous, albeit crude, descriptions of navigating everyday life. The conversation shifted to a math contest problem, followed by an extensive discussion of a Manchester United vs. Manchester City soccer game, including a caller's explanation of the rivalry and the reasons for soccer's lower popularity in America.  A Quiznos delivery led to a humorous exchange and a prolonged, vulgar argument with a staff member ("Chip") about alleged inappropriate behavior.  The final segments included discussion of a viral video, John Travolta's legal issues, Scientology, various television shows and celebrities, interspersed with crude jokes and insults.  The show concluded abruptly amid ongoing argument and insults.

The broadcast concluded with a rambling, nonsensical conversation about seemingly random topics, including giraffes, the hosts' fathers (one claiming his father was in jail for stealing mustache wax), and crude humor involving ejaculate.  The show ended with the announcement that it was "pretty much over" and a promotion for "Monday Live."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  Not enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  I'm only turning on two mics today. I'm very confused.  Good morning, Jimmy.  Hi, Opie. Good morning.  How are you?  Feeling relatively chipper? What's that?  Oh, boy. You sound much better.  I do feel a lot better. I did the antibiotic thing, and my call was almost done just to make sure it didn't kick into what Anthony had. 
[00:00:30]  Right. And you got a nice shirt on.  Thank you. I wore it last night. That's what I wear in the morning, whatever I wore last night.  Do you shower?  In the morning, no. I shower right before I go to the cellar usually or whatever club I'm doing, and then I...  I'm a grease ball. I gotta shower in the morning.  Yeah?  Yeah, you don't look greasy at all.  No, I don't...  I feel all greasy, and my hair gets a bit flat.  Oh, okay.  And it starts separating.  I gotta fluff it up. Gotta fluff everything up. 
[00:01:00]  How do you sleep? Sleep apnea mass?  No, I still...  Still waiting for the accessories?  Because when I called, they were gonna send me the chin strap. It still hasn't come.  I told them overnight, and I'll pay for it.  Your life depends on it. Don't they understand that? If you're in the sleep apnea business, a lot of people's lives depend on your accessories, and you gotta get those things right out.  It's just irritating, like...  Why don't you use some tape or something?  Dude, I thought of it. I actually went to Rite Aid.  A makeshift chin strap for your sleep apnea mask. 
[00:01:30]  I went to Rite Aid to look at Ace bandages.  And you know what's annoying about the pharmacies? None of them sell any of this type of stuff.  You can't get anything for a CPAP mask, and I understand why they don't carry the masks or the machines, but I'm in Dwayne Reed, and they have, like, beauty supplies, and, like, perfume.  And milk.  And milk, fucking, and potato chips, and fat, and Doritos.  Right.  What do you carry in that, and beer?  You can't set up your own chip.  I didn't mean to.  Can we make a rule? You can't set up your own chip. 
[00:02:00]  Unless it's accidental. I just realized it that quick.  All right, fair enough.  Maybe they don't want to be in the sleep apnea business.  Maybe there's some kind of lawsuit thing, or, I don't know, insurance with that shit.  Just a chin strap.  That's all you need.  Just keep the boy's mouth shut.  That's all you need.  Right around my fucking head.  Yeah.  So I was not able to use it.  And I was breathing so badly on Saturday when I went to bed.  Because I went to, uh, I went and saw Anthony Saturday night.  And, uh, he was ready to come in today.  Oh, you were at the compound? 
[00:02:30]  I stopped by and saw him, yeah.  You better get a doctor's note now, too.  Yeah.  How did he look? How did he feel?  He was better.  He didn't go in the jacuzzi or anything.  He just put his feet in.  And he was chatting.  And, uh, he's like, I feel a lot better.  But he was very mellow.  He was, like, just having a couple people.  He was, uh...  Was he walking around with a robe on?  No, he had shorts.  Yeah.  Well, no, he had his pants rolled up.  But he was doing better.  But he's like, this is the first day I've been really out of the bed.  Like, he was just kind of gingerly walking around.  How was the cough? 
[00:03:00]  It would happen in spurts, but not too bad.  It sounded like the tail end of a cough.  Oh, good.  But I wasn't worried to be around it, because he's not contagious now.  Right.  Well, it had every intention of coming in today.  We got the email from Anthony, yes.  When I went to bed, I'm like, all right, cool.  Uh, show back in, uh...  It's, uh, full form.  Right.  And then I woke up this morning and got in here, and Travis said, did you hear?  I'm like, no.  There's always a, did you hear?  Just in general, I mean.  And, uh, I guess, uh, the company wants a doctor's note from him.  I get that. 
[00:03:30]  But why...  How were we notified?  I found out the minute I walked in and just didn't see Anthony sitting here.  Well, they like to, uh, do everything last minute.  What time did we get an email from Ant last night?  Because I got an email from him.  Four or five.  About that.  Said he was coming in, making his...  He wanted to see how he felt Sunday, and he said he was much better and ready to come in.  Right.  Yeah, Ant sent his email at five.  Cool.  Management sent their email at 11.  11.  So six hours later, they send an email.  But 11 o'clock is... 
[00:04:00]  But I was sleeping.  Everyone's sleeping by then.  Yeah, I got the email at three when I woke up.  Meaning you're going to find out this stuff.  Yeah, you're going to find out in the morning.  You know, at the last minute as you're trying to get the radio show off the ground.  But who made this...  Because we would have liked to maybe have somebody in today.  We had no...  We had...  We have no options.  Who made that decision at that hour?  And if they knew it at that hour, didn't they know it Friday morning?  Or couldn't they have said that?  Well, you would think that if they wanted a doctor's note... 
[00:04:30]  They should have been on this.  If that's the direction they wanted to take, they should have been on this from day one.  Amazing.  It's the last minute.  The whooping cough is very contagious.  So if you want to...  I don't know.  They should have been...  Whatever.  Is anyone surprised?  No.  Just irritated.  Is anybody surprised?  I'm not irritated they want it.  I'm irritated with the 11 o'clock at night fucking email.  Well, yeah, because that really gives us zero chance to get somebody in, you know...  What did the email say? 
[00:05:00]  The email to me or the email to Anthony?  About wanting a doctor's note.  Saying that, you know, pertussis is such a serious issue.  We want a doctor's note before you can come back to work to make sure that you're not contagious.  Okay.  Well, that makes sense.  But not at 11 o'clock on a Sunday night.  Yeah, I mean...  Whatever.  11 o'clock on a Sunday night might as well be 4 o'clock on a Monday morning because I'm getting the email then.  Yeah, it doesn't give us an opportunity to figure out if we want to get somebody.  And they didn't email all of us. 
[00:05:30]  So it's like at that hour, I was up at 11 o'clock.  I was at Bob Kelly's.  Right.  I just watched Game of Thrones, Bob and his wife.  Right.  Like, I could have texted people or whatever.  It's just fucking stupid.  Mm-hmm.  Stupid.  Yeah, because you're...  Yeah, you go to bed late, so you could have helped us out big time.  Yeah, if I knew we needed somebody...  They were hanging out with all the guys we probably would have asked to do the show.  It's terrible.  11 o'clock at night, they send that.  Six hours after he sent his email.  Yeah.  What the fuck is that?  But it's good to know that he's doing better.  Yeah, yeah, he's a lot better. 
[00:06:00]  You saw him.  He was coughing, but not...  Not like he was coughing on that phone call.  He sounded better than he did on the phone call.  Yeah, that phone call was horrific.  Yeah, it was like the tail...  You could tell it was the tail end of something.  Right.  So maybe he never had pertussis.  Maybe he had a really bad cold.  I don't know.  I think he did because I think the antibiotics kicked in and did something and helped it.  It kicked in in time?  I don't know.  I mean, he was bad, dude.  No shit.  He sounded terrible.  No one's going to question that. 
[00:06:30]  If it wasn't pertussis, it's something...  It's way worse than a cold, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because his voice is still fucked up.  Yeah.  Like, he can talk, but you can still hear he has...  My throat has been racked voice.  Right.  But it was good to see him, and it was good to see at least walking around and...  You did double duty on Saturday.  What did I do Saturday?  Oh, yeah.  I saw both of the guys.  Saw you in the morning.  Or the afternoon.  Oh, yeah.  I had a kid party, and I invited James P. Norton. 
[00:07:00]  It was nice.  It was all right, right?  I felt bad I didn't have a gift, though.  I just wasn't prepared.  No, man.  I always like to bring a little something.  I asked you last minute.  Still, I showed roughly.  Because I wasn't even sure you'd come to a kid party.  So I'm like, you know what?  I'll ask Jimmy anyway.  And then, no.  The kid won't even know that we even had a birthday party for him.  And if you want to know the truth, I didn't even get him a gift.  I give him a lot of gifts, though.  Yeah.  And I paid for the shindig. 
[00:07:30]  Yes, and you told him that.  Yes, I did.  I went over there, and there was a bunch of people hanging out, and the baby was sleeping.  That's the whole reason everyone's there.  Yeah, and when he finally comes out, all groggy, I'd say 40 minutes later, Ope's wife tells  us, like, yeah, because she calls him Greg.  She's like, Greg was telling him, I paid thousands of dollars for this party.  You have to wake up.  Which I think is very funny.  It probably wasn't thousands or whatever, but. 
[00:08:00]  Well, he got so excited that we were throwing him a party.  He gets everything now.  He understood people were coming up from Philly and all that.  He was running around the house like a fucking lunatic.  And literally, we're feeding him as people are arriving, and he fell asleep in his chair.  Tuckered out?  Tuckered out right when the party was supposed to happen.  And I was trying to, you know, this is a parent thing.  You got to time this shit.  And I was trying to get him to take a nap before the party, so he'd be all good.  He fucking conks out literally as ding dong, the first guests were arriving. 
[00:08:30]  So then it's like, how long do you let him sleep before you completely ruin it?  It was just too much.  He blew a gasket.  It was just too much of an event.  He just knew the party was happening, the people were coming, and he just conked out.  Well, that's like if we were invited to an orgy.  You know what I mean?  You got to wrap your head around that, what his little brain is thinking.  As soon as the bell rang, I'd probably fucking, my abdomen would be cured, and I'd doze off.  I'd wake up with a fucking load on my foot as everybody was gone. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, it was a good time.  Unfortunately, it's, I don't have outdoor space, so everyone had to like, was it hot?  No, it's fine.  You have a massive apartment.  My wife thought it was hot.  I'm like, no, I didn't think so.  I think people were cool.  No, there was plenty of room to spread out.  The little kitchen area was kind of off limits because that's where they're preparing the food,  but the hallway area had the, or the foyer, the grand entrance had the food laid out.  Is that a grand entrance?  It is, yeah.  It's very big.  It's a waste of space.  That's what I think.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Yes.  I want to turn it into a lounge or something.  Oh.  These New York City apartments, they're so stupid.  I'm glad you're bringing this up.  A lot of these places have foyers.  Do you have a foyer?  No.  I got a fiver.  Like, space is limited in New York City, so they waste, in some of these apartments,  they waste a lot of space with this huge foyer, which could be a room, to do something in.  I don't give a fuck.  You come in my apartment and you have this area. 
[00:10:00]  Who cares?  I want to put couches in there or something.  You can.  And then I have a, officially, I got a four-bedroom, and I have four bathrooms.  That's stupid.  But for some reason, New Yorkers love their bathrooms.  Every room has to have its own bathroom.  And I look at that space like, what a waste.  You knock down two bathrooms, you've still got two.  And then you can do something with that space.  You can make the rooms bigger or something.  But you don't want to resell it with two bathrooms.  You've got to leave them there. 
[00:10:30]  No, I know, because other fucking New Yorkers want, for some reason, they want as many bathrooms as possible.  I guarantee we're talking to people that have huge houses out there that don't have four bathrooms.  You know, in the end, it's a small place when it's all considered.  And four bathrooms?  Well, you did something smart in yours.  There's a, when you walk in, I like the foyer there.  And I, the reason, it kind of, it's the central entrance.  And then to the left is a bedroom.  A straight ahead is a bedroom.  I guess to the left is a couple bedrooms. 
[00:11:00]  A straight ahead is a bedroom.  And then to the right is like the living room, other dining room area.  Right.  And you have that central area, so you're not just walking into your bedroom.  Right.  Yeah, but I don't know.  And you knock down the wall between the dining room and the living room.  It's fucking, it's a great space.  Yeah, I opened up the whole place.  No one's going to sit in couches to look at your door.  Yeah, I took out a, I took out a whole room to have, you know, a huge living room.  Yeah.  So we could have potty.  That's great, dude.  But fuck, man, I would, I would take out two bathrooms. 
[00:11:30]  I would take out that foyer and that place would be huge if you think about it.  You know, you make a little tiny little entrance and you move the wall in, then all the rooms  would be a lot bigger.  You could do that.  I invited Rich Voss.  Me and Rich Voss have become friends because when you become a parent, you kind of look  around to who else has kids.  So, you know, they got a little Raina there.  Very cute.  So Rich and Bonnie, you know, get the invites now.  Can I tell you that Rich was fucking, Voss was so fucking funny that day. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  He had me, he made me laugh out loud about eight times.  He was just on fire.  He's great in those situations.  Jesus, he's fucking quick.  When he, he can work a room like that.  I liked at the end when we try to all hug him.  Oh, he hates it.  I said, come on, let's all just hug Rich as he's leaving.  And he, he, yeah, he hates it.  You're right.  Him and Bonnie came together and she's also very funny, but Voss was just killing her and  he was killing everybody. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Um, and what, what did he say behind my back?  Cause I had to be the host.  I want to know some of the fucking lines he had.  He didn't slap you.  I mean, he just, I don't care.  I just want to know anything.  He said, I recorded everything.  Anyway, I'll go through the tapes.  Voss is a guy who always say he prefer to say something to somebody.  Yeah.  He's too dumb to really talk behind people's backs.  He really is.  He's just, I don't even mean it.  I don't even mean that.  Cause I, I had to be a host.  I hate those.  I hate those parties because you can't hang out with anybody.  You have to make sure everyone's cool.  So you're walking around the room and then you're inviting people that don't know other 
[00:13:00]  people.  So you, you feel, you feel obligated to make sure they feel comfortable.  Like we, we invited this couple that we met on vacation that happened to live two blocks  from our house, which is fucked up because we were in Turks and Caicos and we meet this  couple that she had a big gut, that lady.  Oh yeah.  She's, uh, she's due.  Oh yeah.  Okay.  Oh yeah.  She's due any day.  So I felt like, well, they don't know anyone.  So I got to hang out with them a little extra.  There was another couple there that didn't know anybody.  Who's the other couple that didn't know anybody? 
[00:13:30]  Um, the one that had the little girl with the curly hair.  I don't remember.  Yeah.  She, uh, Oh, know who she's best friends with?  I, I just learned last night, you know, the black, uh, the black bitch from a book of  Mormon that sings her lungs out.  Oh, Nikki James.  Childhood friends with that, that woman that was at the party.  I did not know that.  Nikki St.  James out there, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She, uh, she grew up in New York with all like Macaulay Culkin and, and that Nikki  broad.  Oh, okay.  They're all like, uh, performers. 
[00:14:00]  By the way, Josh Gad off the subject real quick is leaving book of Mormon.  Really?  Um, because he got a TV show.  And, uh, so I really want to go see it one more time with him in it.  And, uh, he's, he's leaving.  That's like breaking news.  Did you see, uh, is he getting out of his contract?  Maybe it's, maybe he's up.  I mean, uh, it's a big thing for him.  He did.  I just, I happened to very randomly flip on a movie Saturday afternoon called Love and  Other Drugs.  Right.  Where it's about a, a, a really hot girl who's a Parkinson's patient and she's dating 
[00:14:30]  this guy and, you know, the guy's brother is played by Josh Gad.  He's a funny fucking dude, man.  Yeah, he is.  In movies.  He was really funny in that movie.  Oh, good.  I'll have to check that out.  So yeah, I want to go see book of Mormon one more time with him in it.  Yeah.  It's, I think it sucks when they, uh, they switch out the people.  Yeah.  Like Sam, you went and saw, um, the business movie there.  What was it?  How to succeed in business.  Yeah.  How to succeed.  But you didn't get to see the little Harry Potter kid or, uh, John Larket.  No, but Bo Bridges and Nick Jonas were in it.  Oh, Bo, how's Bo Bridges? 
[00:15:00]  I would love to see him.  He was good.  I mean, the play's ending though.  When?  On Saturday, Sunday.  I don't know.  This is the last week.  Because Nick Jonas, and I know there's a lot of Jonas Brothers fans out there.  A big fucking bust on Broadway.  Is he?  He's sold.  I mean, the theater was full.  Then why are they ending the run?  I don't know.  Because the theater was full and like the sidewalks get swamped after the show.  Of course.  Waiting for Nick Jonas?  Yeah.  Well, when I went with the Harry Potter kid, half the audience was little girls.  They didn't even know what they were seeing. 
[00:15:30]  They just knew they'd want to be there because Harry Potter was on the stage.  It's the same thing with Nick Jonas.  I don't know his name.  I just know he's Harry Potter.  When Nick Jonas first comes on the stage, all the girls start screaming like it's a Jonas Brothers concert.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So what is, I'm sorry, what is E-Rock's Twitter so I can show the respect E-Rock showed Opie's furniture?  I took the photo at the party.  What'd you do?  What'd he do?  Nothing.  Just the way he was sitting.  He was talking to your father-in-law.  I'll show you.  Oh, great.  E-Rock Radio.  Okay, good.  What, was he standing on it?  No, but he might as well have been.  Really?  Yeah.  Do I have to replace any cushions because he was sitting too long in one spot? 
[00:16:00]  They flattened out.  So why is the show ending?  I don't know.  Because it was, I thought...  I think he's a bust.  I mean, it was full when I went on Saturday.  Because he only took over for the Harry Potter kid a mere few months ago.  Yeah.  I bet you they would want at least a year from the guy.  Well, they did, like, one of the kids from Glee was there for a couple weeks.  Right.  And then it was Nick Jonas for the run.  I bet you Rob Bartlett is relieved. 
[00:16:30]  Rob Bartlett loves doing Broadway.  That's the reason we all went to see that play.  Yeah.  I didn't go to see the Harry Potter kid.  I went to see Rob Bartlett because I support my friend.  And he's the guy from Imus that also does Broadway.  I don't know how he does it.  No.  He does Broadway at night and then gets up at 4 in the morning to commute from Long Island to go do Imus' show.  So I hope Imus appreciates Rob Bartlett.  I mean, just the thought of him doing two of those shows in one day.  Right.  Let alone also having a radio gig was insane.  I bet you he's relieved because he had a nice run with that show. 
[00:17:00]  And he gets all the work on Broadway.  He was in The Odd Couple.  He must hate Wednesdays.  Chicago.  I've seen three of his plays already.  Wednesdays has got to be a bitch.  I think that's the matinee day.  Or Wednesdays you do the afternoon show.  So he does three on Wednesdays?  No, two.  Matinee and then night.  Oh, okay.  And then Saturday.  And Saturday he does two.  Saturdays, too.  Okay.  That's a grueling scare.  And Colin said you don't make any money on Broadway.  You don't make any money.  Unless you're Nathan Lane or one of those guys.  Right.  You know, or maybe Alan Alda.  You don't make a fucking dollar on Broadway.  Colin's little play there that we all went and saw, which was really, really good. 
[00:17:30]  It's a shame.  He should have been set for life with something like that.  You get a big fucking spot on Broadway, you know?  And he didn't make any money off that.  That's amazing to me.  What is that about, you think?  I think the investors have to get their money back.  It's expensive to put a show on.  Right.  And it's also, Broadway is so expensive.  The rent is astronomical.  It's got to be in a theater like that.  They have to pay, whatever it is they have to pay, the overhead and the unions.  It's probably very expensive to put a show on. 
[00:18:00]  I grew up thinking if you got one hit, you're set for life.  Yeah.  And Colin's not set after doing that whole play.  That's unbelievable to me.  And a brilliant special.  He did a brilliant special, man.  Right.  He's so smart and funny.  Right.  Yeah, there's, you're not set for anything.  I just assumed if you were on Comedy Central with your stand-up, you got a nice little paycheck.  What do you get for a Comedy Central special about, without that?  I'll tell you.  I mean, I don't know.  I know for, I'm going to guess, I've heard, because I've never done a special just for 
[00:18:30]  Comedy Central, but I've heard 100,000.  You get 100 Gs?  I've heard that, yeah.  I've also heard 75.  You know, I guess it depends.  I'm guessing.  Is that for the half hour?  No, an hour.  So if you get an hour special on Comedy Central, 75 to 100 Gs.  HBO paid better.  I got 50 for a half hour on HBO.  Right.  And I think 150 for the hour.  I bet you this is surprising some people out there.  Maybe.  That's a nice number, but, I mean, all considered, you would think it'd be a lot higher. 
[00:19:00]  You think if you are good enough to finally have an hour special on Comedy Central, that  would, I would have guessed that would have been a half a mil.  I would have guessed that would have been 500,000.  Well, the reason they don't pay, I mean, in fairness.  Because that money goes fast after taxes and all that.  And that's it.  A lot of you guys, like, you know, you work hard to get up to a, you know, getting a special  on Comedy Central or some of these other networks, and then that's it.  So you're getting one big payday of almost 100 Gs.  Well, you have something on a back end, but the way it works is, like, they'll pay you, 
[00:19:30]  say, they pay, HBO paid to get 150, which was great for an hour.  A lot of work goes into it, though.  I mean, it sounds like more than it is, because you immediately lose 20% off the top, 10% agent,  10% manager.  Some people even more than that to their lawyers.  And then your taxes and all that shit.  So you make good money, but you work for that money.  But then they have to pay production costs on top of that.  Right.  So it might cost them, especially in a bigger city, like, especially in New York or whatever 
[00:20:00]  to shoot, it probably costs them at least $150,000 or $200,000 to shoot it, I'm guessing.  So they are, if they start at $200,000 plus $150,000 or $100,000, they're $300,000 in the hole  off the bat.  Before they even pay the talent.  And the only way HBO can make money is through, like, DVD sales, because they, they, and they  don't do advertising on their shows, like, commercials.  God.  So in the end, you got to make your money touring.  Yeah, the hard part, though, is back end is hard to get on these things, because all companies 
[00:20:30]  do this, and every performer should look out for this.  There's something called a distribution fee, which they all have.  And nobody ever, it's accepted.  Like, say, uh, uh, the Opie and Anthony show produces Jim Norton's comedy special, meaning  you guys pay for the camera crew, you pay for everything, let's just say.  All the production costs.  Everything.  All right.  Including my fee.  And I give a, let's say I take a lot less money from you.  Well, if you were working for us, your fee would be about, uh, I think I would give 
[00:21:00]  you $20,000.  I would accept it, out of gratitude.  And, uh, but the back, what happens is, like, okay, I get a good back end, which means  you give me 10% of all DVD sales.  But what all these companies do is they have something called a distribution fee, which  means, yeah, you get 10%, but that's after the distribution fee comes off.  So if we sell a DVD, there's a 20 or 30% distribution fee, which we keep.  It's a fucking VIG.  And nobody ever gets it changed.  And then it's one of those things that's accepted and there's nothing you can do about 
[00:21:30]  it.  And when you say, what is the distribution fee, they say, well, that covers all of our  costs.  But, um, they're basically just taking 25%, 30% off the top and keeping it.  Wow.  So they'll say they didn't break even yet.  That's why what Louis CK did was so important for all the performers out there.  Much bigger than people realize.  Huge.  He, he, he, he changed how you do business in that world.  Yes.  It's huge.  What Louis did, that, that, that had to piss off a lot of people. 
[00:22:00]  And Gaffigan and Aziz is, is even if those two did it too now.  Oh yeah.  They were the numbers two and three.  And, uh, I don't know how they're doing financially with it.  And basically what we're talking about, if you, I don't know if you're behind, Louis  CK did everything on his own.  Yeah.  He sold it up all the money and, uh, he sold it himself.  He didn't, he didn't put it on a network.  And what was it?  A $5 a lot?  Five bucks a download.  Five bucks a download.  He made a shitload and it changed how these guys do business. 
[00:22:30]  I think a million.  And it is the, the figure that came out easy million.  Yeah.  And he had to pay like a lot of money out.  He gave bonuses to his people.  Oh yeah.  It's, it's still a risk.  Louie immediately.  Maybe not for Louie, but when other guys do it, it's going to be a risk.  He immediately gave bonuses to his people.  Right.  Like what?  You know, he makes more money than he thought he was going to make off it.  And he fucking bonuses people.  I mean, right.  It's just a good dude, man.  Uh, and he's not a greedy scumbag at all.  No.  And that does change.  It lets the networks know that you are right now are still very needed, but eventually you won't  be. 
[00:23:00]  No, no, eventually you won't be because there's no, whatever he has to pay.  Like, I guess there's certain fees you have to pay to get your server up or whatever you  have to do to get your, your shit ready for everything to be downloaded.  But man, once they figure that out and this starts happening more, and then let's say  guys like Louie and Aziz want to co-present somebody.  Let's say two guys like powerhouses like that with, with, with, or Kevin Hart.  Mm-hmm.  But if Kevin Hart starts doing that with his fucking three million something Twitter followers, 
[00:23:30]  I mean, it's just, it's all that money the networks are not going to get.  Well, you know, serves them right.  I love it.  They've been fucking over the performer for so long.  Of course people are trying to figure out another way.  Or Daniel Tosh.  Tosh is right now with Comedy Central, so he probably can't, and they're paying him a lot  of money.  Right.  But let's say when he's done with Comedy Central, he moves on and he doesn't want to  sign with the network.  These are guys with a lot of fucking pull.  Sarah could probably do one because she has over a million people.  I think you need close to a million people on Twitter. 
[00:24:00]  Well.  That, I think, is, is the mark, which like people at gym, you should do, there's no way  I could pull that off.  I just couldn't.  I'm not a big enough comic.  We certainly could pull off our radio show this way.  Online?  Oh, yeah.  Or through some other means, yes.  Yeah, I, I, I, I, I've been crunching some numbers.  Yeah.  There's some shit going on out there right now that I'm not blowing up anyone's spot,  but I've, I've been watching.  I've been, I've been crunching some numbers.  There's absolutely another way to do this.  Of course there is.  So, um, where's that picture I want to see? 
[00:24:30]  I tweeted it.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  About E-Rock showing no respect.  Let me see this picture of Jim Norton on Twitter.  Oh, feet up on my couch.  Thanks.  Thanks, E.  You're dirty.  But they were, they were in the middle of the sofa.  Nice.  Yeah.  That's real nice.  Why is he covering his mouth?  Were you farting in my apartment?  He was fucking gassing and fucking, his feet were on your shirt.  He farted on his, on his cushions.  Yeah, and his feet were on his cushions.  Ah.  Yeah, very nice.  Oh, Eric.  What type of guest?  She's a terrible guest. 
[00:25:00]  Terrible guest.  He's just laughing.  He thought that's funny?  I gotta be honest, the food there was fucking really tremendous.  That's, that's my cook.  Yeah, he's great.  The food was so good.  No, it's a shit.  It's a shit.  The food was so good.  That he was the waiter.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  She's, uh, she's amazing.  I, I, I, oh yeah, I did meet her on the way out.  She's very nice.  She's very nice, Jimmy.  Extremely nice.  I may actually, uh, yeah, hire her. 
[00:25:30]  I, I, I've never had a party.  I just get a bunch of cleaning in my apartment.  It looks really good right now.  Right.  So I'm ready to have somebody come in and help me decorate.  And I'm so bad, dude.  Let's have a little party at your house.  I'm afraid of doing that.  Somebody will knock my baseballs over.  Oh.  The, the, uh, boxing, uh, gloves.  Oh, my God.  People, people told me you were literally having a heart attack.  You literally were holding your chest.  You weren't sure if you were in the beginning stages of a heart attack.  I'm sitting there in the living room and, uh.  And I forgot because I do have a backstory to this, but go ahead. 
[00:26:00]  I look over on the, on the, um, on one of the, on the, uh, not a shelf, but a countertop.  And, uh, it's a child's height.  Right.  And I see two signed boxing gloves.  That you got for me.  Um, oh yeah, but I, but you know.  No, you got them for me.  They were from here.  And, uh, I see them.  At least they're in a protective, uh, uh, case.  Oh, that's right.  No, they're not.  There's one glove sitting on top of another glove. 
[00:26:30]  And I'm like, who's, who signed those fucking gloves that the kids can pick up and run around with?  Right.  One is Bernard Hopkins.  And one is Sugar Ray Leonard.  Two of the greatest fighters of all time.  Yeah.  And I'm, I'm going fucking, I'm like, Sam, I, I was, I was very, I was upset by it.  Yeah.  And I'm like, this, this is fucking, this can't stay like this.  Yeah.  The fucking kid's going to grab it and run around.  Yeah.  And then Sam, of course, wants to make you feel worse.  It's like, yeah, at the last party, the kid was like boxing with him.  Well, he had him on last party.  It's unacceptable. 
[00:27:00]  He actually had him on last party.  And I, and I went, oh my God, you can't do that.  I went to your wife and complained behind your back.  I was like, this, this gloves in there.  This can't happen.  This gloves in there.  And she actually, did she get him or did I'll be getting him?  Who, who moved them out of there?  Um, they were given to me.  Oh, they were given to you?  She might've, she, I think.  Somebody gave them to me.  And then I, I, I put them in, in a higher, uh, location.  She did that.  Cause she knew it was ruining the party for me.  Yeah.  The party was being ruined.  Yeah.  Well, I mean the kids in general, they'll, they'll play with the kid shit.  That's all over the place. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  But there is one kid in my family that, that really just looks for other things to play  with.  But those look like kid toys though.  And they're usually adult shit.  Those look like kid toys.  They're big, soft dong, dong boxing gloves.  They fucking hit each other with them.  And he just can't comprehend that you can't put the boxing gloves on and punch people because  they've been signed by champions.  And he did a last party I forgot.  And I, and, and I, I forgot how to ban them from the fucking house.  I was, I was aware enough last party to get him off his little, little, 
[00:28:00]  little fists and, and hide them.  But I forgot to hide them for this party.  Most of my stuff I hide before the parties.  Most of the stuff that I care about.  That's why I don't see much, much stuff around.  Too nice.  I know.  Sugar Ray and Bernard Hopkins.  Those are displayable items.  Yeah.  Those are fucking very, very great, famous hall of fame athletes.  Yeah.  Real rare guys.  So any other highlights from the party that I missed?  No.  I mean, uh, I, I'm trying to think of something.  I can't think of anything Vaughn said, but he was so fucking funny, man. 
[00:28:30]  And his wife was playing with the kids.  What was that about?  No, she likes being, I asked her.  Is Bonnie antisocial?  No, she likes being a mom.  She loves it.  She was sitting in a little kid chair by herself.  And I went to Vaughn.  Serves her right that she has no one to talk to.  Yeah.  Lonely.  Crazy lady.  Lonely in the corner.  No, she, she loves being a mom.  And, uh, their daughter's very, very cute too.  Raina's very cute and she's, yeah.  Vaughn is just a funny fucking dude, man.  Jesus Christ. 
[00:29:00]  Absolutely.  He's a mean, funny guy.  He is.  There's something about Vaughn.  He just hits everybody equal strength, including his wife.  He never, ever pulls a punch.  He just throws punches.  Everybody gets fucking knocked in the face.  No, and he never chills out.  He's always on.  And Bonnie goes, he will tell me all the, all the great lines he had at your party on  the way home.  He'll, I have to go over his set that he had at your house.  Cause to Vaughn, he was having a set.  Yeah.  So he's a complete asshole. 
[00:29:30]  What I discovered about Vaughn for the first time, and I've known him for over 10 years.  He's Jewish.  He's Jewish.  And, uh, and I was laughing like a lunatic because I'd never realized how tiny his butt  is.  Oh God.  Yeah.  He's got a tiny, tiny little butt.  You knew this?  Did you guys used to beat him up for it?  Yeah.  I've seen his tiny, tiny.  Cause I, I guess I was sitting and his butt was right in my face.  I'm like, holy fuck.  That thing is fucking tiny.  Yeah.  It's awful.  It's awful.  Child ass. 
[00:30:00]  It's like a child.  And hands and brain.  Right.  We all know he has tiny hands.  I didn't realize he had a tiny little butt.  His, but his, it's amazing how fucking fast he thinks for such a, if Colin said it right,  he's like, Voss is a dumb Jew, which is very rare, but for such a, for such a fucking  a language idiot.  Right.  Oh, he said another one.  Oh God.  I wish Bonnie was here.  Another butchered expression.  There's too many to count now.  What'd he say?  I don't remember.  No.  I wish I could remember.  Unfortunately, everything he says just kind of goes through an idiot net and I lose most 
[00:30:30]  of it.  Right.  But fuck, he had another one.  Can we call Bonnie or text her?  No.  Oh, you guys got to see my mom too.  I didn't, I didn't even know she was there.  And, uh, and then you said your mom was there.  Yeah.  And, uh, I'm looking in and I, and I see your mother-in-law and I'm like, she's younger  than I, I met her before, but she's younger and a lot hotter than I remember.  My mother-in-law?  Yeah. 
[00:31:00]  Well, she was.  I thought that was your mom.  I'm like, that's your mom?  No, my, no, my mother-in-law is really hot.  Yeah.  She's like, I can say that.  Yeah.  She's checking me out.  She was checking you out.  Yeah.  She kept, you know, getting some vibe.  Voss goes, is she taken?  Is she taken?  But I looked at the living mother, I'm like, that's who you met.  I'm like, that's your mom.  And then I looked to the left on the sofa more.  I'm like, oh.  Let me just put it this way.  Voss is older than my mother-in-law.  And your mom.  And my mom.  Right.  No, the last time you saw my mother-in-law was at the wedding, I guess.  Yeah.  She's a, she's, she's a looker.  And I guess she was all dressed up for the wedding, made her look a little older. 
[00:31:30]  I don't know.  Yeah.  Because that, no, that's how I know her.  No, no, no.  But I, I didn't, I didn't see the woman you were talking about.  And then you're like, no, no, no, over there.  And it was, oh, that's your mom.  Right, right.  I was just not looking at the right part of the sofa.  Yeah.  No, I mean, I obviously married, I'd married young, but then on top of it, my wife's parents  had their kids really young.  Yeah.  So it makes it very, not strange anymore, I guess.  I think it's all what it, it is what it is.  You know.  I'm close, I'm obviously closer in age to my wife's parents than my wife. 
[00:32:00]  And they, but my mom was there, yeah.  And she was, it puts me in an immediate bad mood.  I went over and said hello to her.  And she said hi, she was, she, she, yeah, there's just a weird energy that comes with  my mom.  She seemed.  There was, there was 35 people in my place and the place was packed and the couch was  packed.  Everyone was just kind of shoving in to the one couch I have.  I had to get chairs for my party.  Yeah.  And then, uh, she arrived and sat in the middle of the couch and literally 15 minutes later, 
[00:32:30]  there was no one on the couch.  That's the kind of fucking dark energy she has.  I don't know if it was a dark energy.  I'll be honest, like from an outside point of view, she seemed very, uh, she was just  kind of looking around and she wasn't talking much.  The energy from the outside didn't seem rude or unpleasant.  It was just, she just seemed like an old lady.  I mean, that's like what old ladies are, are, are like where they kind of talk. 
[00:33:00]  They don't, they hear, um, they're harder to talk to.  Really old people can be harder cause you don't know what they know about you and what they  don't know about you.  Um, we just, you know, just chatted about the food being good and she's like, man, the  plate was good and you know, but we didn't, uh, it was weird, but it wasn't a negative energy  I got from her and that, at least in that.  No, that's good to know.  No, but not at all. 
[00:33:30]  You know, she was just, uh, eating the, uh, the food.  Yeah.  And your wife bought her a plate and, uh, dug into the sweets, which were fucking delicious.  You like the sweets?  Yeah.  She's arthritis, your mom?  No, her hands are fucked up.  Yeah.  She's been on a lot of, uh, medication for so long.  I think the medication is.  Oh, that's the other.  That's fucked up everything, to be honest with you.  So she's been on pills for, I don't even know how long, 30 years.  Oh, wow.  And a lot of them.  I mean, a lot of pills. 
[00:34:00]  See, the mom talked, just took the energy out of the room.  No.  I don't think so.  I don't, I enjoy it.  It takes my energy away.  I don't even know how to deal with that anymore.  Well, it's always easier from the outside to see something, you know, to talk to her for  five minutes, you don't get any kind of vibe on them.  Yeah.  But I pick up on shitty negative vibes pretty good.  And, and, uh, I didn't get them from her in that moment.  You were a gentleman.  You were very nice to her.  Of course.  Jimmy's, Jimmy's a gentleman.  I don't know if people know that.  Jimmy likes being invited to parties. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  And he takes them very seriously when he gets there.  Yeah.  He really does.  He socializes and, and he does everything just right.  He makes sure he talks to people.  He makes sure he tries all the food.  He's a, he's a good guest.  I think there's a part of him that really likes to be involved in sort of normal, uh,  uh, nice social functions.  Yeah.  Because, you know, he's such a filth bag.  Well, yeah, I mean, you're right.  Well, that's what confuses people.  But then you see him outside what he does in the radio show.  And he's a really just a down to earth, nice guy. 
[00:35:00]  Decent human being.  You could tell you were raised very well.  Yeah.  My parents.  That's why it's so weird.  They'd be very happy to hear that.  The juxtaposition of you just that I, I still, I'm not, I'm not used to it after all these  years.  Well, I'm always nice to people's wives, girlfriends, and families always like, especially my friends.  But I'll never, I'll never accept rudeness to my chick or my family.  Right.  I'm always, you got this weird.  It's like as much as we like in the comics and all of us fucking smash each other around  each other's families. 
[00:35:30]  It's like, no, you're, yeah, you want, we, I, you know, there's a humanity we have to have  with each other or it's, or it's just not fun.  No, that's, that's all obvious shit, but you would just assume that you wouldn't be  that guy.  Yeah.  But, you know, you are, you know, you, you take things very seriously.  Thank you.  You know, if I show up at one of your gigs, I could tell you're generally, generally very  happy.  I, I, I, you know, showed and all that crap.  So, and my parents, my, I would be very happy to hear that.  They, uh, it's just, I've told them that it's weird manners. 
[00:36:00]  Like I've had some nice conversations with your parents.  They're lovely people.  Very nice, lovely people.  Of course they are.  So I talked to my mother yesterday.  I didn't see her cause she's so far away.  Oh, Mother's Day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I did call her.  We had a nice chit chat.  Nothing.  Uh, you know, Saturday sort of taking care of that, right?  Nope.  Fuck.  Saturday was your child's birthday.  Unless you said happy Mother's Day.  Yeah, I did.  On the way I said, happy, happy Mother's Day.  Here's some strawberries from Sherry's Berries.  Enjoy.  That's nice.  Had extra breweries. 
[00:36:30]  Did you have a nice time with her?  See, for the people that don't know, we used as sponsors.  I, my, my house was filled with Sherry's Berries.  Is that who provided?  Dude, those berries were fucking phenomenal.  Yeah.  That's the Sherry's Berries.  I opened up a box for everybody.  They were, were they, were they, were they, that's what the little treats were made out  of?  We had these little treats.  Oh no.  That Wolfgang Van Halen made us?  They were delicious.  Which treats?  The little pastry thing?  Yeah.  No, that was her shit.  Yeah, but she had to use berries to make them.  She brought her own berries for that. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They were good.  What were you going to say?  I did eat some fruit.  Nice fruit ball.  You had some good stuff.  I didn't eat any candy.  I was trying to eat better.  How do you avoid all the sweets?  I had...  I just didn't.  Because I've eaten...  Again, the week after the special...  I've only exercised like three or four times since the fucking special.  I've been so tired and bad and not sleeping.  That's all right.  Can you guys hear my nose right now?  That's my right nostril.  My left one's blocked up.  My right one's free.  And that's how I'm talking.  Because my fucking...  I had to shoot Afrin one night because I couldn't breathe. 
[00:37:30]  I'm trying to...  You can't breathe out of both nostrils after all the surgery and all the shit you've done.  No.  You know what it was?  One night, I was...  I couldn't breathe.  Did cum get stuck in one of the nostrils?  No, no, no, no.  That would be...  Like cement?  Well, yeah.  It's better there than me going...  So I had to Afrin one night just so I could breathe.  So I only did it one night.  Now it's where I...  Blow out both noses.  Give me one.  Like I could go...  That's right.  That's one nostril.  I can't do it.  That's me pretty good.  Do it. 
[00:38:00]  Do it.  Do it.  Left.  Right.  That's it?  Yeah, it's terrible.  So what is that?  It's clearing up.  But I mean, I'm not going to Afrin again.  It swells up when you stop taking the Afrin.  Yeah, because that's highly addicting, right?  Highly addictive.  It shrinks the...  I got one Afrin thing in my medicine cabinet.  It's good for an emergency when you're sick or whatever, but...  Yeah, every...  Nah, I can't even say every once in a while.  I forget it's even in there.  But you blast that shit in your nose.  Holy fuck.  I stopped using it, really.  You realize that's how you're supposed to breathe through. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Through life.  So what did you say to your mom?  You didn't see her from Mother's Day.  Yeah, we chatted.  My sister's pregnant, so...  Damn, is that good or bad?  It's good.  I mean, she's happy.  I mean, she wants...  Man, she's pregnant.  I know.  She's got an older kid.  Yeah, her son's 18.  Imagine my nephew is 17.  There's going to be a...  Or 18.  There's going to be like an 18-year difference between the two.  Damn.  I didn't know that.  Congratulations.  Yeah.  She's having a...  I don't know if it's a boy or a girl or not. 
[00:39:00]  I don't know if she knows even.  But, so she's going through that.  Your parents got to be happy.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Another grandkid.  And me, I'll have another niece or nephew, which, again, gets them off my fucking back.  Good.  Another baby in the family.  Yay!  They bother you about having kids?  Nah, they know better.  They know better.  They don't.  I think of that like...  Does part of you want to have a kid?  No.  At all.  But I see you with your son and your wife.  And I look at your life and it's like, you're happy because that's what you wanted.  Like, you have a perfect setup. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, I think people have been confused by me for many, many years because, you know,  they feel like they know us because of this radio show.  And I guess I gave off the wrong vibe for many years because I was with the wrong fucking broad for so long.  What an idiot.  I look back at that.  I'm like, well, I wouldn't have what I have today.  So it makes it easier.  But before I met my wife and had my son, I was like, you just wasted like 10 years.  What's wrong with you? 
[00:40:00]  Literally, I felt like that.  But then when all this came together, then it's justified.  But looking back, I'm like, what a fucking idiot.  I always wanted a family.  I always wanted a big family, to be honest with you.  I feel very immature, though.  I was sitting there.  I'm in the apartment.  Immature?  Meaning, like, I look at you, and I knew you when you were single.  Right.  You're now married with a kid.  Anthony.  Is it that much different, though?  No, but I'm thinking as a whole.  Anthony, I really didn't know when he was married, but he has been married.  And I'm thinking of the guys on the radio show since we've come back. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  Young Sam is now getting married.  If fucking Danny gets married, I'm going to hang myself.  Travis is now married with a daughter.  Iraq is now married.  He'll be having kids someday.  Well, he's pregnant, I thought.  Eric.  He looks pregnant.  Are you pregnant, Eric?  Eric?  Eric.  Way to derail the story, Sam.  Oh.  That is true, Sam.  It took the wind out of me sails.  Oh, boy.  But Voss has been married. 
[00:41:00]  Bob Kelly is now married.  Since we've been back, all these people?  Yes, Voss was married before.  I'm saying Voss and Anthony don't count, because Voss was married ever since I knew him.  And Anthony was married before I really knew him.  But the guys, you...  You never knew Anthony as a married guy?  Nah, that was the tail end of the...  It was just the split was happening when I came in.  That's why I'm truly happy for Anthony, because I guess I'm the only guy that knew Anthony when he was married, right?  I'm trying to think.  Yeah, I met him at the very end. 
[00:41:30]  Jimmy was the closest, but trust me, I'm very happy for Anthony.  Anthony was very private about his private life back then, on the air.  I remember he didn't want to get into stuff.  It's weird.  He's much more open now.  Well...  You know, maybe he just...  You know, going through that is really hard, I'm sure.  Divorce is brutal.  Well, I could certainly speak for Anthony.  He wouldn't mind.  He was probably a bit scared.  Oh, maybe.  I mean, this...  I'd rather...  Wait for him?  Yeah, well, it's everything we talked about.  But, I mean, there'd be hell at home, man, if he, you know, talked badly about anything. 
[00:42:00]  You know, he was in a tough spot, so was I.  I was in a fucking tough spot.  You know, it was my stupid upbringing where you hang in there.  When times get tough, you just hang in there.  When you said that your ex or your chick at the time went on a vacation on his credit card with his ex-wife...  But, yeah, that was all near the end of that.  I knew my relationship was over.  It just took me another, I don't know.  A couple years.  A couple years, unfortunately.  Because that's what I knew growing up, man. 
[00:42:30]  You know, it's no secret my mom was fucking ill, mentally ill most of my life.  My entire life, what am I saying?  And my dad hung in there and tried to make her better.  And, you know, he refused to leave.  Anyone...  I mean, I feel bad saying this, but...  I think most men would have left my mom a long fucking time ago, but my dad hung in there.  And we all learned that behavior.  So, I knew my relationship at the time was wrong.  And I'm like, ah, no, you hang in there and things will turn around. 
[00:43:00]  And, ugh.  You know?  What were you saying, though?  Sorry, I just...  Oh, it's okay.  I just went off fucking road.  What was I saying?  I don't remember.  Oh, about everyone being married and you feel, what, immature or something?  No, it's just...  I'm looking at my single friends.  Like, who do I know that is single?  Everyone I know is headed towards...  And me and my ex are still friends.  Like, she's one of my favorite people in history.  Right.  I don't know if we'll get back or not.  I mean...  Even...  I don't know.  Even with a kid, I don't feel like my life drastically changed. 
[00:43:30]  I don't even really feel married, if that makes sense.  Because I always looked at people that were married.  It's something I wanted to do, yes.  But I always wanted to do it my way and go and try not to change too much.  You know?  We all have friends.  They get married and all of a sudden, like, who is this fucking person?  Right.  Everything changes.  And I don't really feel like my life has drastically changed that much.  It's just brought out another side of me that I always had, I guess.  You know?  But besides that, I feel like I could still do pretty much whatever I want.  I don't really know anybody single. 
[00:44:00]  I mean, I know some single people.  It's part of getting older.  People you know start dying and your friends...  I mean, it's a part of it.  And everyone out there who's 35 and up knows this.  But I don't look at you any differently.  No, I know.  And none of your friends do.  No, not at all.  But I'm only thinking from my own point of view.  Because we're in our own weird little world, too.  Yeah.  We're not like, you know, people get married and...  I don't know.  It's hard to explain.  We're in a different world just because of what we do, I guess.  What's acceptable in our world, and I think of this a lot, 
[00:44:30]  like what is acceptable for us to talk about, even with each other?  Or, like, if I get a massage where I get jerked off,  there's none of my friends I can't tell that to or won't.  Right.  And none of them are shocked by it.  They might laugh and go, well, how was she?  Or was it a she?  You know, whatever fucking idiot questions my friends will ask me.  Right.  But none of them are like, what?  Right.  And I think sometimes, like, can you imagine walking into an office  and discussing...  Well, go back to my party.  ...the thing that we talk about with each other.  Well, go back to my party.  People socialize and there's people there you don't know, 
[00:45:00]  and you just casually bring up the fact you get, you know...  Yeah.  ...wacked off every once in a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I'm trying to say by that.  We're in our own little world where we accept that more, I think.  It's hard to shock people who we work with in radio and stand-up  and all this stuff.  But regular people, man, it's got to be very fucking difficult  to not be able to talk about this stuff.  Yeah.  I kind of went off a different tangent there,  just thinking about all my friends who are...  And I don't feel sad about it.  Like, my ex and I just fought too much, and that was it. 
[00:45:30]  And I wondered to myself, should we get back?  Like, I don't want to get back for the wrong reasons.  Like, I don't want to get back with her just because  I don't want someone else to have her.  That's a very sick, unhealthy, possessive way.  But then I'm like, am I staying single for the wrong reasons?  But you just said something that so many people can relate to,  where, you know, you don't want to see your ex with somebody else.  But when you get to the point where you don't give a fuck  if she, in my case, is with someone else, 
[00:46:00]  then you know you're over us.  I could care less.  Right, of course.  Does that mean I care then, Sam?  How do we do that again?  I couldn't care less.  I couldn't care less, yeah.  Yeah, and I got to that point fast.  Fast.  There were other...  I remember, you know, growing up and, you know,  having these girlfriends or whatever,  and then you break up,  and it almost would rip your heart out  knowing they were with somebody else.  Even though you knew at the time it wasn't right, 
[00:46:30]  but there was still that connection.  And you would...  And in some cases, yeah,  I would prolong it and continue with that relationship  because I just couldn't even fathom them with somebody else.  Yeah.  And it's weird to think that, like...  And then all of a sudden you're afraid of waking up that one day  where you're like, oh my God, I made a mistake.  And it's too late.  And it's too late.  That's like a movie.  Because I know someone that happened to,  a buddy of mine who was with a woman.  They were married or whatever,  and they messed up, and he regrets it.  But I often... 
[00:47:00]  We've talked recently,  and he's talked to me about regretting it  and how he fucked up.  But then I ask him now,  is it that you really regret it  or that once the choice was taken away...  Mm-hmm.  And then he's like, I'll never know that.  I don't know.  Wow.  Sometimes it's just when the choice is gone,  you convince yourself you wanted something more than you did.  Mm-hmm.  I just don't know.  But with her, she's still one of my favorite people.  It's nice to be...  I'm never immediately friends with an ex, 
[00:47:30]  but the one that I broke up with,  we split 10 months ago.  It's like when I think of getting back together,  I still think of our fights.  Not like fuck her and I'm mad,  but it's just like, I don't know.  Maybe we're better off being friends.  I just don't know.  Dude, you guys were good together, man.  At times.  I've told you this.  At times we were great together.  At times both.  I saw all the good times then.  Yeah, the fight.  You didn't see her standing there screaming  or me saying just go home and her not leaving  or me being irrational and fucking...  Did you know you were being irrational at times?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:48:00]  Sometimes yes and sometimes no.  Like, I look back on it  and I see a lot more of her point of view  than I did when I was in it.  Right.  Sure.  Sure.  You see yourself ever getting married?  I don't know because...  I don't know, man.  I'm such an addict.  Like, I'm such a fucking...  It's so hard for me  to not even watch the porn  or dirty text or little things.  I cannot fuck girls,  but that little...  I feel like once you're in a relationship  and you're committed and that's it,  that's the ceiling.  And most people I know,  comics especially,  just hate the fucking ceiling. 
[00:48:30]  And I'm sure most people out there listening  can relate.  Like, you hate seeing the end of the wall.  Like, you like looking down the tunnel  and not knowing where anything can go.  Right.  But seeing the end of the tunnel  makes you feel mortal and human and older  and you just all of a sudden  get fucking freaked out  because you're like,  that's the end.  There's the end.  Not that it's bad, the end,  but there's the end.  Not seeing the end  helps keep you feeling like you're younger  and you're not going to fucking drop dead.  Don't have a kid.  You realize, fuck.  I know. 
[00:49:00]  You realize you made your replacement.  Holy fuck.  I know.  I'm not even joking.  I love it, but it's like,  oh my God, this means I'm getting older.  He's going to push me  the fuck out of this world.  That's what that means in the end.  In a way, when I was single  as long as I was,  I always felt the same age.  I always felt the same age  until I had a kid.  No joke.  Because, I mean, look at us.  We're fucking kids at heart.  We're idiots.  It's immature lives we live.  Right.  But I feel like, 
[00:49:30]  and this will make people howl  and that's fine.  Man, I swear to God,  I feel like I've been 27  for a really long time.  That's my age.  27, 28.  But then when I had a kid,  it was like,  no, you're in your fucking 40s.  Yeah.  And every fucking ache I feel now  and I'm like,  holy shit.  I am now,  now I'm moving,  you know,  forward with my age.  You feel,  I feel the same way.  Like, I might,  my age,  I acknowledge the number. 
[00:50:00]  What's your age?  43, for real.  No, no.  How do you feel though?  27 is a good way to put it.  I felt like,  you know,  okay,  I'm out of college.  I've had a few years  out of college.  30 has always been  that weird number  where, you know,  you have to really  have your shit together  and I never felt like  I ever had to have  my shit together.  I didn't need a house.  I didn't need a wife.  I didn't need kids.  I didn't need shit.  So I always feel  27, 28  was always my number  that I walked through life as.  Between 30 and 33 
[00:50:30]  because I'm Christ-like.  But I would say  in that early 30s way  because there's still  a very,  like I'm smart  with certain things  in business.  Like I work really hard.  I pay my bills.  Like I do certain things  a lot better than I did  when I was 21, 22.  Right, right.  I'm very financially independent.  Like I like to make  smart decisions  and take,  you know,  again,  I take care of myself  a lot better  than I would have  in my mid-20s  and I have feelings  about whether it's  politics or all this stuff  that I didn't have  in my early or mid-20s.  But I don't relate 
[00:51:00]  to people whose lives  are fucking adult,  quote-unquote.  So I think early 30s  is where I feel like  I'm at,  31, maybe 32.  And you just feel like  that's your age.  Yeah, I mean,  obviously your number's  going up.  Do people understand  what we're talking about?  Yeah, of course they do.  I think everyone has that.  Of course they do.  Because they all have  friends in high school  and college  that are married  and they're not married  or that stayed  or divorced.  My good friend growing up,  we went to different colleges  and when I went to college  it was like complete freedom  because of how I was brought up. 
[00:51:30]  And when he came home  for that first summer,  we're 18.  We're 18,  maybe 19 at this point.  I looked at him  like he was 30 years old already.  That's what I mean by this.  For some reason  he felt like he had to be  way more mature  because he's in college.  He had a very serious major  and everything,  like he had to get  his shit together.  He had to get married.  He had to get his house.  He had to get his brand new car.  You know what I'm trying to say?  And I did not relate  to this kid  at 19 years old.  I'm like,  what happened to you?  We're only a year older. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, we're out of high school  but what the fuck?  Why are you,  you know,  why are you walking around  like you're a 30 year old man?  It was weird to me.  And I've run into these people  over the years,  you know,  where they drastically change  because they feel like something,  they have to change everything  because they're getting older.  And it is,  it makes,  when you hang with those people,  it makes you feel older.  Like that's what scares me  is feeling like,  I mean,  I know I'm an adult.  Obviously,  I live like one  but emotionally,  I don't want to, 
[00:52:30]  I just don't want to acknowledge it,  man.  I don't want to fucking acknowledge it.  No,  I don't either.  It's fucking horrifying.  Yeah,  I don't think we'll ever acknowledge it  officially,  no.  And maybe that's the right way to be.  Maybe it's like,  maybe there are people  who look at maturity  or being an adult as,  maybe it's not the fact  that you're getting older,  it's not the number I'm scared of,  it's just the way people,  a lot of times,  lose their sense of humor  or they begin taking things  too seriously.  Right.  Or they begin going,  oh,  come on now,  that's silly.  Right.  When you want to go out  and do something. 
[00:53:00]  I don't know.  That's all the stuff  I'm talking about.  Yeah.  You know,  I mean,  I've been in radio  my entire life  so maybe this is not  the best example  but I remember like  people around my age  not discovering new music  when they're in their  like mid-twenties.  I'm like,  seriously?  There's so much  great music still.  Now that I'm in my upper forties,  it's like,  now I think I'm finally  losing that part of me.  I don't discover music  as much as I used to  but I went a long way  still discovering music  but these guys  were listening to classic rock  in their mid-twenties.  I'm like,  dude,  do you understand 
[00:53:30]  there's a band out there  called Nirvana  or Alice in Chains  at the time?  Metallica,  they didn't want to be  bothered with Metallica  as mid-twenty-year-olds.  I'm like,  are you serious?  See,  that was the end  of the tunnel.  They were listening to Seeger  and Bad Company  and Zeppelin,  sure,  bands that you could  certainly still listen to  but they,  something happened  in their brain  where they're like,  alright,  that's it.  That's it.  I don't want to  discover anything.  I know what I know  and I'm just going to  stay in that world  and I never  understood that.  It's like you get married,  like a lot of guys  get married and have  the kid  and that's what happened. 
[00:54:00]  That's what scares me,  what you just said.  It's like,  that's where the tree  starts,  I hate to,  I can't phrase it  any better,  I should be shot for free,  but like the tree  starts getting taller,  stops getting taller  and then the branch  and the branch  is the kid  and your life there  begins going off  to one direction  and I don't want  that middle part  to stop.  Like it scares me  to have that stop  and then the branch  is about the kid  and being married  and shit.  I think eventually  it does happen  to the best of us.  Of course it does.  But, you know,  my...  Florentine's getting married.  Right.  Florentine.  Right.  Jesus, he has a kid  and he's getting married 
[00:54:30]  and he's happy.  Right.  He, again, like you,  waited until he wanted it  and if that's not scary,  that makes me go,  hey, that's not that bad.  Watching you get married  and watching Florentine,  because you're both guys  I knew for years single,  do it because you want  to do it,  is not,  it doesn't look trapped.  Right.  It doesn't look...  Like, you know,  Sam and Eric and Travis  are younger than me  so that I don't...  Those are guys  I didn't know for years  as an equal in age.  Well, I think there's a lot... 
[00:55:00]  Or intelligence.  I think there's a lot of people,  maybe society does it,  their own families,  whatever.  I think a lot of people  end up just marrying  the wrong person, man.  They're...  I've called it settling  over the years  where it's like,  oh, it's...  The sex is good,  kind of care about this person,  but it's, you know,  they kind of know deep down  that there's probably  someone better out there,  but they just kind of settle  for whatever reason.  And those are the ones that,  you know,  you fast forward a bunch of years  and their marriages  are fucking, you know,  just shit, you know? 
[00:55:30]  But I think a lot of people  do that.  They don't want to be alone,  you know,  maybe, maybe like,  their parents are pressuring them,  oh, you're 30,  when are you going to get married?  And then, you know,  the first broad  that you feel  some kind of connection to,  you go all in,  you know?  And then I wonder,  am I, am I, like,  when I look at my own thing,  and again,  I think of my ex-girlfriend  who I have a great friendship with,  and we had great sex,  she's a great sexual partner,  she's funny,  like, you know,  it's like,  I don't look at my ex 
[00:56:00]  and go,  oh, she's this or that,  you know,  there's parts of her that suck,  just like there's parts of me  that suck,  but she was a good one.  You still talk about her, Jimmy.  Well, she's also  my last frame of reference,  and she's also  the character's lover,  and she's very tied in.  The character's lover?  Did you hear what he just said?  Yeah, I'm just kidding.  But we also...  I don't know if you're kidding.  We, uh...  You need someone  to love your character.  She also makes me...  Which, by the way,  I'm starting to warm up to Josh,  I'll be honest with you.  Oh, Josh was...  I like the Josh. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I like Josh a lot.  I like Josh, too.  I really do like Josh.  Why?  He's just the guy  at the party  who wants everybody to have fun.  He touches.  To what?  Ah!  Sammy!  Ah, Sammy!  Sam hates him in the hallway,  and he's walking ahead of me,  and I go, Sammy!  Here comes Josh!  But then I'm like,  am I allowing the...  Like I said, the addiction,  the thought of just  the pornography and jerking...  Like, am I allowing that  to stop me from fucking...  I don't know.  Where did the addiction come from?  Ah, it's just lifelong. 
[00:57:00]  You know.  I don't know.  You know?  I don't know.  Just childhood shit, I guess.  Whatever.  You know, I'm not sure.  Where does anybody's crazy,  you know,  obsession and...  Well, I...  A lot of my shit,  I just could easily  go back to my mom.  Easily.  At this point.  Through therapy, I know.  I know I did a lot of the stuff  I did because of,  you know,  my upbringing with my mom, so...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know how much  of it was my doing  or how much of it was theirs.  I don't know.  But it's like, you know, 
[00:57:30]  I go to therapy.  I'm a little annoyed  at therapy lately.  Not her,  but I just think,  eh, it's boring to go.  Yeah.  Oh, that's why I take breaks.  Yeah, you know,  I might take one.  I take a little break.  For a month.  Because, yeah, yeah,  you don't want to...  A, I never want to feel  sorry for myself, ever.  And B, I don't want to sit there  and go,  oh, and then I didn't get  the bicycle I wanted  when I was 12.  You almost don't have stuff  to talk about anymore.  So you start making shit up  that, you know,  you know doesn't matter to you.  You know?  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  That's right.  You feel like you have  none to talk about.  Like, yeah.  Yeah.  I've had some,  some,  some awareness  through that.  Breakthroughs.  Some breakthroughs, certainly.  Oh, that's why I do that.  Ah.  So.  I'm glad you guys  came to the party.  It was fun, man.  It was,  the food was fantastic.  Jesus.  7.30 already.  And, um,  yeah.  The food was great  and fucking,  um,  it was fun.  I dug right in 
[00:58:30]  the minute I got there.  You did.  You enjoyed the food.  I did.  Said my hello.  Hello, hello, hello.  Excuse me, excuse me.  Excuse me.  Pardon me.  Excuse me.  Hello, hello, excuse me.  This all started  because I said  you, uh,  did double time.  So then  you had this family  gathering,  a little kid party  and then you  head out to Ant's.  Oh, right.  Yes.  That might have been  a little different.  Not that much different though.  This,  I've been there  when it's crazy.  It was more chill.  Very chill.  There was only a couple  of people there  and a couple of his friends 
[00:59:00]  and, uh,  very mellow.  Very mellow setting.  Um,  I just went over there  to hang.  Um,  just relax and sit  and see him a little bit  because I was like,  I was done in the city.  I was like,  what am I going to do?  It's,  um,  it wasn't a decision I had  until I was leaving  for my spot.  I'm like,  fuck it,  I'll go see Ant.  Cause I'm home for a while now  since I'm done shooting.  Good.  Done editing.  I'm so fucking happy to be done.  Chill out.  Chill the fuck out.  I'm trying not to sniffle  into the mic as much so.  I don't have a cough button 
[00:59:30]  by the way to the fans  so a lot of times I sniffle.  I am sorry  but I don't have a cough button.  If I did I would hit it.  But I don't have any buttons.  Sit over there.  There's a lot of buttons over there.  Can't sit in and see.  I'm used to seeing you  face to face  and Sam on my right.  I personally wish we  had another studio.  I don't know if I've brought  this up on the air  but we were talking about  before the show  because a huge article  came out on Patrice O'Neill  by a writer we all know.  Adrian, yes.  Adrian is a really good writer  and she's been working 
[01:00:00]  on a Patrice O'Neill story  for, well,  since he died.  Since November.  So it's,  what are we up to?  Seven months already.  And it finally came out.  It's on the internet  but it's coming out  in the magazine  any day now.  What, tomorrow maybe?  Yes, and then.  I haven't read it yet  but I just assume  she did a great job  because she takes her time  with this shit obviously.  But with that said,  I don't like looking  at that fucking chair  to your eyes, Jimmy.  I don't know if I've ever  brought this up.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I can't look at that  fucking chair.  I don't care who,  so many of our friends  sit there  but that's Patrice's 
[01:00:30]  fucking chair, man.  Yeah.  Period.  Fuck.  Yeah, it's,  it's a rough one.  Patrice,  we all have friends die.  It's a part of it.  His is the hardest ever.  Awful.  Just because his voice  was so loud.  And it was unexpected.  Like, I wish Patrice  had got cancer.  I mean, that sounds terrible  but I wish I had  a year to go,  oh boy, this big dope  is on his way out.  Like, you know,  or it would have been easier  if he was doing drugs.  Like, Geraldo,  I was closer to Patrice 
[01:01:00]  but I loved Greg too.  Right.  But you knew  that sooner or later,  We knew we were getting  the call with Geraldo.  You expected it  because I know so many people  in sobriety who have died.  So I can't even count anymore  how many suicides I know  and fuck it.  You just,  you don't get used to it  where it doesn't hurt  but you understand  that it's a part of it.  All in the comedy world too, huh?  No.  No, no.  A lot of them  are not in the comedy world.  Oh, okay.  The suicides are mostly  in the comedy world  but a lot of them not.  A lot of the deaths,  a lot of the AIDS deaths  who have been from, 
[01:01:30]  since many years ago.  I got sober in 87.  So the guys I knew  who died of AIDS,  a lot of them were out  actively shooting  in the 80s and 70s.  You never did needles,  did you?  No, I did not.  You ever think of it?  No, because I was scared  of needles.  I mean, I'll take them  for medical reasons  but no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I had some very close  friends that have AIDS  and, you know,  it was just from getting high, man.  And I knew what it was  back in those days.  You know, in the early 90s  in sobriety.  Wow. 
[01:02:00]  I still,  I don't know.  It's, you know,  you get used to certain things  but natural causes,  natural causes are hard.  Right.  Because now I'm starting  to see my friends  that have natural causes.  Mikey Stefan was a fucking  heart attack.  Right.  Gee, ugh.  Ugh, fuck.  Stroke, heart attack.  Mm-hmm.  These are normal guy things.  Mm-hmm.  So that's where it gets  fucking difficult.  But yeah, this seat,  Patrice is a rough one.  And everyone has deaths  that are easier  than other deaths.  Everyone has them.  I agree with you.  That are,  and not easier 
[01:02:30]  because you didn't love them.  I mean, him I loved  as much as I love  any of my friends.  So Bobby Kelly  will be his hardest.  Or Voss.  These are all guys  that are on the same level.  Of course, you guys.  These are all same level  Right.  Guys, friends.  He was just bigger than life.  That's what makes it tough.  Yeah.  Just bigger than fucking life.  All right.  So if you're just tuning in,  Ant was supposed to be here  but the company wants  a fucking note from his doctor.  Which is, again,  totally fine.  But how about  you don't email  at 11 o'clock? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, in the end  I understand why  but, you know.  Oh, for crimey sakes.  You know,  they gotta,  I mean,  as soon as they found out  that he had whooping cough  they should have been  down this road.  You know,  because Ant had every intention  of being here today.  So hopefully he'll be  back tomorrow.  Hopefully.  We'll see.  You know,  balloons look like tits  by the way.  You see my,  you see the picture  of my balloons  on Instagram?  I did not.  I was,  the only reason 
[01:03:30]  I bring this up  was because we  bought a shitload  of balloons  for the kid  for his birthday  and I was laying  on the couch  very early  yesterday morning  and I'm just  looking up  at the ceiling  and the balloons  were there  in pairs.  Let's see this,  Jimmy.  In pairs  and they were moving  because my windows  were open.  They were moving  in unison  like boobs  and I was getting,  I'm not even  fucking joking,  I was getting  really turned on  looking at the ceiling.  Maybe we could talk  about this 
[01:04:00]  after the break.  Maybe someone  could relate  to this shit.  I was looking  at this dumb picture.  The picture  doesn't do it justice  because you got to know  there was a little breeze  in my apartment  because all the windows  were open.  Nobody in their 40s  will relate to it.  I got turned on  looking at two balloons  shake like tits.  Do they look like tits,  Sam?  I guess.  Look at the two  on the way left.  Do those two balloons  look like tits,  right?  I guess around.  And they were moving  in unison  and I was just  laying on the couch,  you know,  everyone was still sleeping  and I'm going,  holy fuck,  I'm getting turned on 
[01:04:30]  by this scene.  Because you look  straight up at balloons  that are on your ceiling  because of the helium.  I'm telling you.  I'm telling you.  I never noticed  that before.  No?  I'm crazy, right?  I'm crazy.  I don't think Jim  has to worry about  feeling immature  around you anymore  if you're looking  at balloons.  Why?  I got a rod  looking at balloons?  No,  no,  it's totally  healthy and good.  Well,  I did tweet that  and people were like,  oh,  great.  Good to know  that you're still  getting turned on  at your age  by balloons.  Although,  that must mean 
[01:05:00]  that you have  a very vigorous  sexual appetite.  Oh,  very,  very.  You know,  that's good.  Very,  very,  yeah.  If you're trying  to put your dick  between two balloons.  It was nice  to see your girl  too,  Sam.  She looked  very lovely.  Oh,  thank you very much.  She's a very nice  girl.  Three weeks  out from the  wedding.  This big wedding.  Less than three weeks,  yeah.  Less than three weeks,  holy fuck.  Yeah.  She said that she  got the invites  and she wrote down  the card as chip.  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  It took a while  to explain to her  mother,  who was writing  down everything,  that it's not  three people.  Oh,  really?  It's two people.  It counts as Jim,  but it doesn't say Jim.  Let's go one call  before the break.  Yay.  Andrew.  Hey.  Hello.  You're getting a little  depressing there.  Why?  You hurt the crowd.  Just talking about death  and getting old  and all that.  Well,  the Patrice thing.  Yeah,  I'm sorry.  Plus,  it's what we were  thinking of,  dude.  I mean,  when your friends  start having 
[01:06:00]  second birthday parties  for their sons,  how old are you,  bro?  I'm 46  and I have a 14-year-old  and it's Monday morning  and...  You want to laugh.  Damn right.  Well,  I brought up  the fucking balloon tit thing.  That could get us going.  Yeah,  that was great.  I appreciate that.  All right.  Well,  we're going to go  with the balloon tit thing  after the break.  We're going to get  some laughs at you.  We just try to go  with whatever's coming up.  I'll talk about it.  I mean,  it's great.  It's just all the bad shit.  I like the first hour, 
[01:06:30]  man.  Yeah.  I kind of liked it.  It was a little different,  but don't worry.  We're going to talk about  balloons turning you on.  And I've heard  a tremendous theory  about John Travolta,  which,  again,  may just be  a complete theory.  And the fucking  accuser  fucked up so bad  that the lawyer said,  I can't take this case.  Well,  I guess we can explain  after the break.  Yeah.  I don't mind  that me and Jimmy  got to know each other  a little more today.  I never mind.  I never worry.  We've been friends forever.  And this is  no disrespect to the listeners.  I understand  what you guys are saying. 
[01:07:00]  No,  actually,  I just checked  my Twitter quickly.  In general,  they dug it.  I never worry  about what people  out there are thinking.  And again,  that makes for probably  a bad radio guy.  True.  But I never care.  Not true to  you're a bad radio guy.  Right, right, yeah.  I never care  because I'm like,  this is what it is  at the moment.  This is the kind of show  it is.  It is at times  very unstructured.  And we just yap  about whatever's  on our mind.  And that's what it is.  Well, also,  we had to just  make it up today  because we just all  assumed Ant was back  and would be  at full strength. 
[01:07:30]  And last minute,  we're finding out  he needs a doctor's note.  And an article on Patrice  came out today.  I didn't plan on that  when I walked in the door.  I didn't plan on,  I forgot Adrian  was writing an article  until I got a fact check  call from the New Yorker.  I mean,  they're a real magazine  so of course  they check facts.  Well, it's funny  you should say that  because Patrice's girl  there,  Von DeCarlo  on Twitter,  V-O-N-D-E  Carlo,  C-A-R-L-O,  one word,  Von DeCarlo,  just tweeted the article.  And it's New York Magazine. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, I'm sorry,  New York Magazine.  New York Magazine.  When will it be out,  I wonder.  Patrice's girl saying  thank you, Adrian LeBlanc  for an outstanding article  on Patrice O'Neill.  Very cool.  And it's NYMag on Twitter.  I don't know if they have  the link to that article yet.  I don't know if  they were smart,  they would.  It's online.  The article's online.  Yeah, but they should have  had a link on their Twitter  to the article.  And it's the magazine itself.  It'll be out either today  or tomorrow.  I hope today.  Why would they put it out  a day before?  They're just killing their own...  Magazines by putting  things online immediately 
[01:08:30]  are really hurting  their own business.  That's why they're going  with those outrageous  covers now.  But even the outrageous  cover doesn't help  because you'll just look  at the, you know,  you'll look online at it.  I read a great thing.  I haven't read a magazine  in a long time.  I read...  I like greedy magazines.  I like grabbing one  for the plane and shit.  Timer Newsweek,  and they had  Bin Laden's last days.  It was last week's issue  or two weeks ago,  whatever it was.  I saved it  so I could read the article.  Right.  And it was really  fucking good, man.  In what way?  Could they talk about the... 
[01:09:00]  I'll talk about when we get back  what I liked about it.  Because that's going to lead us  to another...  I thought it was handled  very, very well.  Really?  Yes.  And we could talk about  the cover of Newsweek.  We did talk about it,  but yes.  No, Newsweek, no.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  That really annoyed me.  It does, right?  Yes.  Annoyed me.  All right.  We got a lot of explaining  to do next.  But let's not forget,  do balloons turn you on  because they look like  big, full titties?  I need to know.  I wanted to make a video, 
[01:09:30]  by the way.  I just couldn't figure it out  because I'm just laying  on my couch  looking up at the ceiling.  I'm like, man,  they're moving around  like nice big boobies.  And I was just going  to film it.  And then I took my son  out for a little while.  When I came back,  all the balloons  are on the floor.  It's just like life.  That was life sped up.  What fucking helium?  Did we get cheap helium?  Our balloons were on the floor  in less than a day?  The fuck?  That's normal, I think.  Can you get cheap helium? 
[01:10:00]  We'll find out next.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the opinion  of today's show.  That's my Frank Sinatra.  You like that?  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Fucking love this song. 
[01:10:30]  Thumbs up or down on Frank?  Not even this one?  I wouldn't care if I...  No.  I wouldn't care if I never  heard him sing again.  To touch your head.  I think his lyrics  are the worst lyrics  in music history.  You're pissing off  a lot of New Yorkers.  He could sing, though.  Snodger could sing.  He's a god to a lot of people.  All summer long,  we sang a song.  Yeah, man.  It's simple times, Jimmy.  So what?  The lyrics stunk.  It's not so simple 
[01:11:00]  out there anymore.  Listen,  just two sweethearts.  That's wonderful.  I just like how  they kind of romanticize  everything,  but you know  these two sweethearts  were doing some banging  and that guy was  finger-popping  under the summer wind.  And one was friends  with Sam Giancana.  This is Christ Frank.  The world was new.  The world was new.  Beneath the blue  umbrella sky.  Umbrella skies.  You can relate to that. 
[01:11:30]  Nice umbrella sky.  Then softer than  Yeah.  Then what happened?  Uh-huh.  One day  it called you  This is one of his  better songs, though.  Summer Wind's great.  I lost you  I lost you  to the summer wind  Yeah, I mean,  I'd say this is a good song.  And I also like  the one that you like,  Seasons of R-whatever.  Dude.  That's a great Sinatra song.  Dude, don't.  I fucking cried 
[01:12:00]  like a bitch  in the car  with my blood.  But she barely  knew me, too.  That's when I knew  I might have found somebody.  Found out she liked Sinatra.  We're driving home  from Philly.  Put on, like,  she had a cassette tape,  I think, at the time.  I don't remember.  No, it was a disc, I guess.  Illegally downloaded music.  And that song came on  and I started bawling  and I had to explain  to her why.  Because I would go  to my parents' house  and my dad would be  sitting on his chair.  All the kids are now  out of the house.  He's got a fucking 
[01:12:30]  lunatic wife upstairs  sleeping all day.  And he's playing that song.  He loved that song.  What is it called, even?  I forgot.  You know what, E-Rock?  No, I'm looking it up.  I do not see it.  I forgot what it's called.  Seasons of...  When I was 17?  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  I mean...  It's a whole fucking song  about a guy  just reflecting on his life  and there's my...  A very good year.  A very good year.  And there's my  getting older, fast dad. 
[01:13:00]  I'd walk in the living room  and he's just chilling  out to that song.  I got that album  in my house.  Did you see it?  It's on display.  The Frank Sinatra record  that he used to play  all the time.  Don't play it.  I don't feel like  fucking being weird  and shit right now.  Oh, why the Frank Sinatra?  He died, right?  14 years ago.  Wow.  14 years ago today  we lost Frank Sinatra  at 82.  So he could have been alive  still technically.  96.  That would have been  a tough 96. 
[01:13:30]  And then Seinfeld  14 years ago.  Last episode.  Aired.  Oh boy.  I'm getting text messages.  Hold on a minute.  Let's see.  Okay, good.  Okay.  Oh.  Okay.  Oh.  Wow.  All right, good.  My ship is coming in.  What's that?  My ship, I said.  Ship.  Let's say hi to Scott  in New York. 
[01:14:00]  Scott, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  Just gotta tell Jimmy.  Your CPAP stuff,  you can look for it  on eBay.  Number one.  Number two,  durable medical goods.  Just go to your yellow pages.  Thank you.  I am one day behind you.  You started one day  before I did last week.  I can't tell you  how much better I feel.  Oh my God,  it's like somebody's  been feeding me  fucking painkillers  for the last year.  All of a sudden,  I got all this energy,  which, by the way,  the wife appreciates too.  One last thing 
[01:14:30]  before I check out.  Jimmy,  careful with the chin strap.  You need a chin  for a chin strap.  I know.  It's humiliating.  Come on, boys.  I didn't want to say it.  I let him slide on that.  Oh, yeah.  That's gonna be very difficult  to find a chin.  I'm so happy  that I have a strap  for the chin strap.  I'm gonna try to use it  tonight if I can  with my chin strap.  If they mailed it.  I asked them overnight  if they didn't.  I'll pay for it.  Yeah.  God almighty,  why is everything  so fucking hard?  Everything's fucking hard.  Nothing's easy in this world 
[01:15:00]  for whatever reason.  Paul in PA.  That's why  summer wind is so nice.  I bet you things  were easy back then.  Yeah, I know.  Just a girl  with her nice eyes  and blue umbrella skies.  Yes.  How about something about  and I wake up  gasping for air  because my tongue collapses  over my airway.  So I'm gagging  and suffocating  while you enjoy  the summer wind.  I can't breathe.  I'll just keep going.  I want to know the 
[01:15:30]  could you look up  the lyrics to summer wind?  They're childish.  I didn't realize  they were childish.  They're awful.  Lyrics.  There's some other ones too.  Did you like  the Frank Sinatra  impersonator  at my wedding?  Did we ever talk  about that guy?  No, I haven't noticed him.  With the horrible rug?  He took over  the fucking room.  He wanted to sing  a Frank Sinatra song  in honor of my dad  who couldn't be  at my wedding obviously.  Oh, I didn't see him.  And then four songs later  the band was like  what the fuck is this? 
[01:16:00]  There's a mini  Frank Sinatra concert  going on.  I don't even remember him.  No, you wouldn't remember.  You were probably  making some time  with a young lady.  He's probably out there  getting some candy maybe.  Probably were fucking  showing my cackle.  What do you got, Paul?  Huh?  Paul!  Huh?  Helium is...  All right.  Remember the helium thing.  Sure, it makes your voice crazy.  I want to know  why my balloons  didn't even last  a fucking day.  They didn't even last  24 hours.  John in Connecticut,  what's up? 
[01:16:30]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  All right.  Well, one, you're cheap,  so you probably bought  latex balloons, right?  What's latex balloons?  Regular balloons.  Yeah, all right.  Latex balloons are more porous  than the Mylar balloons,  so they're going to...  How come they're not richest?  Just let the record state  that there's a fine  Mylar Toy Story balloon  still fucking floating  nice and high  in my apartment.  All right,  because you went  to a party store,  not a 99 cent.  Yeah, I went for  a quick little  I need like 
[01:17:00]  fucking 50 balloons  on the ceiling  to jazz up  the place a little bit.  You didn't go to  some shitty 99 cent store?  No, I went to  like the local party  bullshit store  in my neighborhood.  All right, yeah.  No, the helium is good.  There are some party stores  have a supplier  that's in New York  that actually does  add nitrogen  to their helium  because helium  is really expensive  and right now  there's actually  a helium shortage globally.  So...  How is there  a helium shortage?  Well, helium is a product  of natural gas. 
[01:17:30]  It's a byproduct  of, you know,  making natural gas.  So when natural gas  sources are becoming  depleted,  it's kind of complicated.  There's only three plants  in the world really  that produce helium.  They're not really  in America.  The ones in America  are all byproducts  of natural gas.  It all comes out of Texas.  It all goes to  Manalapan, New Jersey.  From there  it gets distributed.  It's all fucked up  right now real bad.  That's craziness though.  Can I...  No.  The Mylar balloon  that'll float forever.  The shitty latex balloon 
[01:18:00]  really porous  because, you know,  don't be cheap next time, buddy  and you'll have balloons  that float around.  What?  I need to get 50 Mylar balloons  so that...  How long do you need them for?  You have to float  for more than 20 minutes.  I expected the balloons  to drop to the fucking floor.  I didn't expect it to happen  in less than 24 hours.  I figured it would be  a couple days.  I'm not stupid.  They realistically  they usually only last  about 24 hours.  That's about what a Mylar  or a regular latex balloon  is going to get you.  And I got depressed  because I wanted to go back  into my apartment  and lay on my couch 
[01:18:30]  because I was very tired.  It was a long weekend  and look up at the balloons  and get turned on  because they look like  big titties.  Then you should have  paid for Mylar balloons.  Yeah, but the Mylar balloons  don't look like big titties  like the regular balloon  that we all know and love.  They make some round ones  nowadays.  Okay, I'll have to  look into that.  Thank you, sir.  All right, take it easy, guys.  All right, man.  Josh in Philly.  Josh, what's up, buddy?  Hey, morning, guys.  Morning.  I got an idea for you  for your CPAP machine.  I've been using one for years 
[01:19:00]  and I absolutely love it.  When I first got it,  they had it set  on a ramp setting  where when you first  turn it on,  the pressure is lower.  They say it's so that  you don't feel it as much  as you're going to sleep.  I found that I felt  like I was suffocating,  kind of like you were  talking about the other day.  If you turn that ramp setting off,  but you can do it  by going through  the menu settings,  it'll actually turn on  at full pressure  and then it feels  a lot better going to sleep.  You don't feel like  you're suffocating then.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.  These sleep apnea masks 
[01:19:30]  are very complicated.  That's the machine itself, yeah.  Oh, the machine itself.  Oh, it's the whole thing, Greg.  I'm very confused  by the whole thing.  All right, I guess  I'm the only one  to turn down big balloons  so we can move on  from that fucking thing.  Really?  Yeah.  There's not everyday things  that just turn you on?  No.  Besides the obvious.  I was like 10.  I mean, did I ever look  at two balloons and go  they look like boobies  and get turned on?  Yes.  Never.  Not even when I was six.  Really?  Never.  You don't fantasize? 
[01:20:00]  I do a lot,  but not about fucking balloons.  You know.  All right.  U.S. drifting toward helium shortage.  That's the actual headline?  That's right.  People are finding  the Patrice O'Neill article.  It's on our Facebook page, too.  Oh, it is Opie and Anthony.  There you go.  That's the easiest way.  I'll retweet Von DiCarlo  if I can find her  in my timeline.  Yeah, I'll just retweet  Opie Radio on Twitter.  Cheap plug.  I'll admit it every time.  And Von DiCarlo. 
[01:20:30]  And there you go.  I just tweeted,  retweeted her.  She's got the link  to the article  for the Patrice O'Neill article.  There you go.  Simple as that.  It's a wonderful world  we live in.  How was everyone else's  weekend, by the way?  Anything else go on?  No, just...  Anything else going on,  I should say.  No.  No?  Mellow.  Mellow.  Hang on New York weekend.  And, uh...  Oh, the article  about Bin Laden.  Oh!  I knew there was something.  I thought it was great, man.  I didn't read it,  so help me out  so I don't have to read this thing.  Well, I've been praising Obama 
[01:21:00]  because I think he did a...  It was a gutsy thing  to go into Pakistan.  And everybody is so...  No matter what side  of the fence,  Trump people are  so fucking biased.  Well, liberals say no  to the conservatives.  I thought it was a great move  and I just thought  they broke down  what happened  and how he knew  for eight months  and he's a very careful  decision guy  and how Biden  had advised him  not to do it  and so did Robert Gates,  Secretary of Defense.  They thought that,  as they say,  boots on the ground  was too risky  and they should have  dropped 500-pound bombs  or done a predator drone strike, 
[01:21:30]  but Obama listened  to other advisors  on why those things were bad.  Like, a predator drone strike  might have had  civilian deaths  and then he said  that you couldn't count  on the Pakistanis  to help you  so they may not  have been helpful  sifting through the rubble  so you may not  have gotten an accurate  record of what bodies  were found  or they may have lied  about civilian casualties  and said there were more.  Do you feel like Obama  was in a tough spot  and felt like he needed  a big one?  Very tough spot,  but I also...  No, but I mean,  do you feel there was  a bit of desperation 
[01:22:00]  on his part too  where he's like,  I gotta get this thing done.  I'm not looking  too good right now.  My presidency needs something,  a nice bump.  I'll tell you what,  because in the beginning  one of his priorities  had been to get bin Laden  and he said that  he made that a priority.  Yeah, but Bush wanted that.  Bin Laden reprioritized it.  Right.  And he also narrowed down  and changed the amount  of people that had to...  He made it a very small  group of people  that were his advisors.  Like, he changed  some of his advisors  and he changed  the way that was done.  I liked the way 
[01:22:30]  he handled this a lot  and I was right to like it  because I read about  the process he went through  and then decided to put...  Because they said  dropping bombs,  one of the disadvantages...  The disadvantage  of sending in troops  is you risk troops  being killed  or captured.  But they said  that if they had just  dropped bombs  they might not have  gotten the confirmation  that they needed  and anything  that would have helped  them bring down  Al-Qaeda  that was in bin Laden's  compound  they would have lost.  Right.  He said they wanted  to get what was there too.  Right.  And he said 
[01:23:00]  that they got  a 40% yes  from some people  that it was bin Laden  living there  and 80% chance  from this  and like a 60% chance  from the CIA.  Everybody had  a different percentage  and Predator drone  images  you could see  somebody kind of  walking in the yard  every day  but they had tarps  over the garden  just so Predator drones  couldn't see him.  Very, very interesting.  But they actually  got footage of him  walking around?  Oh, they thought  that was him, yeah.  Is that in the magazine article?  Yeah.  They don't show the footage  but they didn't tell 
[01:23:30]  the Pakistanis  they couldn't trust anybody.  There was like  only six people knew  for a long time  and they finally  brought in Robert Gates  and they finally  brought in Hillary Clinton  but they weren't even  allowed to bring staff  or any  they were so fucking  worried about a leak  when they were going  to kill bin Laden.  It was a great article  and I, again  I think it was a ballsy move  because it could have  destroyed his presidency  if it didn't work.  If it didn't work  and 10 SEALs were killed  or it wasn't  in fact him  and it was just another  if we went into 
[01:24:00]  and Pakistan  is just  but they also said  that since they've  gone through  all the rubble  and everything  there was not  one shred of evidence  that Pakistan  actually knew  even though I think  they did  they have not found  anything there  that indicated  that the Pakistanis  was there.  It's weird to me.  Yeah, I think it's weird too.  But do they have  his last days  you were saying?  Yeah, when they talk  about his  you know  the way he lived  with his wives  and they go through  the raid very carefully  and  How was he living  the final days?  In squalor.  I mean  they said he paid 
[01:24:30]  his trusted courier  100 bucks a week  I think  or 100 bucks  very terrible money  which is proof  that Al-Qaeda  was running out of funds  and  he only had  Wait, a guy  a guy he had  a count on  he was only paying  100 bucks a week?  Yeah, and they killed  that guy immediately  when they got the  I think his nickname was  the Kuwaiti I think  and  there was a three story  this is interesting  the courier  one of his most trusted  What do you mean  they killed him right away?  When the seals went in 
[01:25:00]  he was one of the guys  they shot immediately  Oh, okay  He lived in a one story  house with his wife  and then behind their house  was another seven foot wall  Bin Laden had walls  in his compound  where certain people  who lived in the compound  didn't even see him  in the six years  they were there  the courier's wife  only got a glimpse  of Bin Laden once  and she lived in the compound  with him  He lived there six years  or five years  He stayed in that house  didn't leave the second  or third floor  because again  he was afraid of  the fucking predator drones  taking photos  Wait, you're confusing me  you said he lived  with his family  in a one story house 
[01:25:30]  No, that was the courier  Bin Laden lived in a  two or three story house  Oh, so the courier  lived in a one story house  outside of a wall  Right, okay  in between two walls  There was a wall  and then like grounds  I think  and then the courier  and then  or a guard house  that he lived in  and then behind that  was another wall  and then Bin Laden  lived back there  in a three story  but he only had  windows on one side  so when the seal raid  was going on  Bin Laden couldn't even  look out his windows  he just knew  something was happening  and they said  one reason he might not  have gotten into  a firefight  in his house 
[01:26:00]  is because he was  afraid that his  wives and children  he lived with like  20 of his kids  or 20 grandkids  and three of his  wives were with him  so he was probably  afraid that they  would have been killed  Do you think this  guy had fear?  Of course he did  and they said he wore  just for men  because he was very  worried about his image  and this is how smart  the seals were  they cut the power  to the town  before they went in  the electricity being  fed into the town  was cut  so there's no way  they could have gotten 
[01:26:30]  any type of power  you know  so the seals  had a tremendous  besides technologically  had the advantage  now they had all  the night vision gear  and you know  Bin Laden  those guys  didn't have a chance  wow  and it was a pretty  easy raid  with the exception  of the helicopter  fuck up  which they explain  that  when the helicopter  crashed  because  they said  in the  I don't want to  say rehearsals  but in the  run throughs  in the mock up  compound  they had been  working with  there was a  chain link fence  so when they came  in behind solid  concrete walls  the solid concrete 
[01:27:00]  might have helped  the air whip  around faster  which hurt  the hell  it did something  and gave them  a heavy landing  whatever they call  it in the military  okay  but it was really  an amazing  and Admiral McRaven  I think his name  was was the guy  that pushed Bin Laden  finally and goes  no this is what we do  we go in  we get people  we kill people  and we get out  in a helicopter  that's what  seals do  right  so they were smart  to do that  and I just  he was just living  in squalor  with that shitty TV  that we've all seen  right  yeah he did not  what was he doing  writing a lot  but they said  he mailed letters  he did not do  on the internet 
[01:27:30]  he was smart  I mean Bin Laden  was not a dumb guy  I mean he knew  that there's  everything was traceable  but they said  it was also  not an effective way  to run Al Qaeda  because you're  writing a letter  and then your couriers  take it  and sometimes  it was two or three  months before  you got the response  like when he wrote  the head of Al Qaeda  in I want to say  Somalia  you know it would  take a couple of months  to get a response  because there's  all these couriers  and all this  fucking cloak and dagger  shit  tough to do business  that way  hard to do business  but again  had he used cell phones  and internet  he probably would have  been killed  by 2006  sure of course 
[01:28:00]  or 2007  I'm just amazed  he was only paying  the courier  a hundred dollars a week  yeah or whatever it was  yeah it was terrible  I'm just amazed  by that  and they also said  that Bush and Clinton  did not have the technology  that Obama has  there's certain technologies  that President Obama  now has  that just weren't  available a few years ago  which made  tracking him  because there was  they were watching it  unfold on Predator drone  footage  I mean  there was  Predator drones  fucking capturing  the whole thing  they had helmet cams  I don't think  we'll ever see  the footage  I think we'll see 
[01:28:30]  the footage  eventually  dude that's  that's not  police footage  that's  fucking  classified  military footage  whoever leaked  that would be traceable  right  like that's one  of those ones  where if you leaked  it  unless WikiLeaks  gets a hold of it  right  or unless it was  leaked like that  we'll see it  somebody will fuck up  somewhere  but the guy was very  the guy was very descriptive  he said that when  they shot him once  I think once in the chest  or once in the temple  and once in the eye  they said his brains  were all over the ceiling  and just fucking  gushing out of his left eye  he really took a brutal 
[01:29:00]  couple of seal headshots  wow  and his wife got shot  in the calf  his young 20 year old wife  because I think  they were worried about  her having a suicide vest  right  so they shot her in the calf  they killed  the courier  and they shot his wife  and there was another  oh his main bodyguard  they killed him  and his wife  and they shot his son  I think Khalid  or whatever  his son  in the main house  he was killed  how old was his son  I don't know  I want to say 21  maybe 30  I could be wrong  but yeah 
[01:29:30]  he was a smart dude  and just  he was obsessed  with his own image  and didn't like  getting older  I guess  now they got to get  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  this fucking cocksucker  making a big circus  at Guantanamo  right  and now they just  got to get Al-Zawahari  and they got all of him  where is he  don't know  they still don't know  where he is  no  no idea  but they said  they had not had  a good line on bin Laden  since Tora Bora in 2001  that was the last time  they knew where he was  and that's what  they're telling us  they might know  where he is by now  oh 
[01:30:00]  Al-Zawahari  if they did  they'd kill him  immediately  oh I know  but maybe  maybe  maybe it's a tough one  you know  yeah  it's hard to believe  that they don't know  where he is  but this is why  you hate the media  you think Bush knew  where Osama was  absolutely not  under no  in Tora Bora he did  and they surrounded him  and he got away  no  you don't think Bush knew  he was in this compound  but they just couldn't  figure out a way  absolutely not  absolutely not  when did they know  they got wind  I think eight months before  that's it  they thought they had  a good sights on bin Laden 
[01:30:30]  they had Intel  and this is where  this is where WikiLeaks  I mean I kind of admire them  and I kind of hate them too  in the New York Times  of course  you'd never get loyalty  out of your newspapers  unless it's one of their  fucking guys  that's captured  like if the New York Times  or whatever  if the newspapers  or the news  has one of their reporters  then they'll sit on information  to protect their own  but when it comes to  national security  they don't give a fuck  sure  but in the WikiLeaks  there was one thing  where they had indicated  that they had a courier  they had gotten one of them 
[01:31:00]  and I think that if  bin Laden's people  had looked closer  they would have realized  that the US government  knew the name of the courier  knew who he was  bin Laden's main courier  and that might have  tipped them off  but for some reason  that got by everybody  and the government  was able  but WikiLeaks  there was information  but Obama  was briefed separately  from even like  the high classified  briefings every day  the briefing on this  what was it  Abadabad I think  it was called 
[01:31:30]  where he was  I don't know  that was the compound  that was a separate brief  they were fucking  paranoid about leaks  so they handled this  he was smart  to do it like that  to handle it like this  and to cut off  the amount of people  that knew  so kill him  for what you don't  like him on  metaphorically speaking  I'm saying that  of course not physically  like you know  you can bad mouth  Obama for what  you don't like him  for but I think  he did it  like when Trump  was saying  Donald Trump annoyed  me because he was  saying like  anybody would have  done that  it's like come on  man you can't  give the president  credit when he  gets the guy 
[01:32:00]  we've been after  right  I mean whether  you like him  or not  well it's  fucking come on  he got him  well everything  has to be  politicized  unfortunately  it's fucking  ridiculous  you know  obviously if Romney  was in office  he'd go for it  I don't know  maybe  I think any president  would go for it  it worked out in  Obama's favor  you gotta give him  credit  you just have to  we think that  any president  would go for it  but would any  president be willing  to send a SEAL team  into Pakistan  without telling  because it  humiliated  it ruined our  relationship with  Pakistan  it humiliated 
[01:32:30]  the Pakistani  army and government  and they won't  release all the  ways they tried  to get them  but this is what  geniuses  these fucking  black ops people  are  they said that  one of the things  they had done  and of course  Pakistan arrested  the doctor  because they're not  true allies  this shit  was that they  had a local  doctor who had  been giving  inoculations to  the children  locally  and he was  trying to get  Bin Laden DNA  like what he was  doing I guess  was giving needles 
[01:33:00]  to all the kids  and I guess  saving  the needles  and seeing  any Bin Laden  DNA  so I don't know  if that worked  or not  I don't know  if that was  a confirmation  but two of his  kids were born  in local hospitals  he had four kids  when he was living  there  wow  but yeah  reading this  people are asking  what magazine  again  it was either  Time or Newsweek  my parents got me  a subscription  I believe it was  Time a few weeks  ago  it's like a  black and white  kind of aerial  footage cover 
[01:33:30]  like it looks  like a military  photograph  it was Bin Laden's  last days  and  fuck I gotta  read this now  it's so good man  it was really  interesting  and I just  I think  like I said  I know somebody  who had  who had  a meal  with McRaven  the guy  who was in charge  of the entire thing  and he said  coming from him  he said  that it was  a ballsy thing  that the president  did  so I kind of 
[01:34:00]  you know  I kind of  take it on  to that  no no no  but somebody  he introduced me to  no Jonathan  couldn't meet him  you never know  Jonathan  but he  even he said  that it was  it was done  right  and it was  gutsy  because it  could have  backfired  right  and they  didn't  he didn't  do the  fucking  bombing  he didn't  kill him  with a  bombing  he didn't  kill a  predator  he sent  in fucking  troops  and it's  not here  he'd be  yelling and  screaming  he might  not though  I mean  he'd be  yelling and  screaming  his voice  would get  better real  fast if he  was listening 
[01:34:30]  to this  I just  don't  maybe Bush  would have  done it  you know  Bush wanted  him badly  but I don't  say that  anybody  would have  just  sent in  troops  to  one of  our allies  without telling  them  without involving  them  I don't  say that  anybody  just would  have  done that  he might  have  and Romney  very well  may have  right  but I  don't  know  Ron Paul  probably  would not  have  right  as much  as I  like  Ron Paul  and I  don't  like  his  son  by the  way  so  fuck  Rand  Paul  oh  you  know  why  I  don't  why  don't  you  because  he's  the  guy  they're  saying  he's 
[01:35:00]  a way  way  religious  conservative  he's  pro-life  and I  guess  Ron Paul  is too  and I  think  he's  anti-gay  marriage  I believe  that's  all I'm  going to  say about  it  because  people  are  annoyed  that  I'm  on that  rant  lately  so I  apologize  which rant  about  gay  marriage  on  Twitter  it's  been  annoying  me  very  much  lately  well  what  do  you  think  of  is it  newsweek  calling  Obama  the  first  gay  president  you  said  you're  annoyed  by  that  it  annoyed  me  because  it's  going  to  he  was  forced  to  come  to  that  conclusion  don't  you  think  yes  and I  know  they  call  Clinton  the  first  black  president  but  you  think  Obama  is 
[01:35:30]  for  gay  marriage  if you  sat  him  down  in a  bar  without  all  this  shit  like I  said  I  don't  know  because  he  was  very  close  to  Jeremiah  Wright  who  was  a  fairly  conservative  hardcore  black  preacher  and  they  don't  typically  go  for  gay  marriage  but  he's  also  I  understand  people  have  to  evolve  on  their  own  time  but  I  don't  think  Obama  was  ready  to  endorse  this  I  really  don't  but  with  an  election  coming  up  it's  a  hot  topic  I  feel  like  his  hand  was  forced  on  this  one  radically  left 
[01:36:00]  I  think  he's  very  liberal  not  as  liberal  as  I  thought  with  and  they  put  the  rainbow  halo  over  his  head  and  he's  looking  up  and  he  looks  white  in  this  photo  and  it  says  the  first  gay  president  and  it's  just  a  cover  that  is  meant  to  be  shocking  or  like  ooh  well  they're  playing  off  the  fact  that  they  called  Clinton  the  first  black  president  I  understand  they're  playing  off  that  obviously  but  John 
[01:36:30]  Montone  one  of the  local  news  guys  in  New  he's  married  he's  taking  it  literally  the  cover  he's  married  and  they're  portraying  him  as  gay  it's  like  no  that's  not  what  they're  going  for  here  it's  figures  stupid  people  out there  don't  get it  we can  find that  clip  it made  me chuckle  on the  what kind  of dummy  thinks they  really mean  that  there's  people  they're  just  playing  off  the  Clinton  it  might  hurt  him  in  the  election 
[01:37:00]  though  it  might  actually  win  the  election  came out  with this  if he  knew  it was  going  to hurt  him  he would  have  kept  his  mouth  shut  maybe  and then  there's  a part  of me  that likes  the fact  that he  just has  to state  where he  is  you know  what I  mean  you take  the  fucking  hit  for it  or you  win  for it  but I  just  I like  I'm so  tired  of all  these guys  fucking  half  stepping  and  pushing  around  I think  every  single  thing  these  guys  do  is  calculated  and  for  whatever 
[01:37:30]  reason  he  feels  like  coming  out  and  supporting  gay  marriage  right  now  is  good  for  the  election  that's  coming  up  I  can't  imagine  this  close  to  an  election  he's  just  going  to  tell  the  world  how  he  feels  without  really  thinking  it  over  with  his  people  and  I  think  you  were  right  about  Biden  I  think  Biden  forced  his  hand  in  a way  yeah  man  because  Biden  really  just  went  rogue  on  that  whole  thing  why  would  you  why  would  you  come  down  so  then  it  put  him  in  a  tough  spot  with  the  minority  opinion  it  really  is  the  minority  opinion  in  the  country  he's  got to be 
[01:38:00]  pissed  at  Biden  behind  closed  doors  he's  probably  like  what  the  fuck  are  you  doing  I  have  to  support  this  and  yeah  you  know  what  that's  another  way  to  look  at  it  now  I'm  supporting  something  that  might  hurt  our  well  I  I  agree  but  you  know  they  have  to  they  have  to  look  at  every 
[01:38:30]  little  fucking  topic  and  see  how  it's  going  to  affect  them  it's  kind  of  like  I  love  Phil  Hendry  by  the  way  and  I  will  still  do  a  radio  show  I  mean  he's  doing  it  on  his  own  I  got  to  talk  to  him  see  how  much  money  he's  making  because  it's  it's  time  to  make  some  moves  around  here  and  Phil  Hendry  basically  said  what did  he say  this  morning  he  said  the  thing  that  killed  radio  now  is  on  Twitter  and  the  thing  that  killed  radio  is  ratings  is 
[01:39:00]  the  people  meter  and all  that  shit  the  arbitrons  and  it's  the  same  shit  with  all  this  that's  why  these  guys  can't  speak  their  mind  because  Twitter  no  they  got  research  out  there  so  it's  like  you  know  say  you're  for  gay  marriage  it  could  affect  you  this  way  this  way  this  way  and  that's  what  happened  with  fucking  radio  shows  and  all  that  the  consultants  and  overdoing  the  whole  rating  system  fucked  up  radio  companies  just  hiring  guys  to  just 
[01:39:30]  be  themselves  what  was  his  last  tweet  it  was  good  Phil  Hendry  he's  solid  man  he's  a  solid  fucking  broadcaster  seems  like  he's  out  of  his  fucking  mind  but  what  did  he  say  really  fast  he  tweets  a lot  this  fucking  guy  he  tweets  way  more  than  me  well  this  is a  dead  end  that's  good  how  many  followers  does he  have  Phil  hundred  28  28  he likes 
[01:40:00]  a nice  low  number  alright  whatever  yeah  what is  it  one of  the  reasons  radio  has  failed  so  wonderfully  now  has  a  Twitter  account  and  it's  ARB  programming  ARB  programming  ARB  programming  ARB  programming  is now  on  Twitter  is that  a real  Twitter  account  what are  some of  the tweets  I'm sure  it is  I am  sure  of it  yeah  I mean  it's  real  yeah  cause  you know  did you  know  that  Spanish  radio 
[01:40:30]  reaches  27  million  listeners  every  week  that's  a  tweet  from  ARB  programming  who  the fuck  would  follow  that  except  for  their  employees  yeah  consultants  and  overlooking  and  the rating  system  just killed  regular radio  for sure  man  this last part  didn't go anywhere  and my balloon  thing didn't go anywhere  I'm the only one  turned on by balloons  when they're floating 
[01:41:00]  on the ceiling  you should try it  someday  it's good  that's like a little  kid thing though  that's not like  gotta make sure  the balloons  are all  you know  matched up  in twos  you live with  your wife  so  I'm sure  she gets  turned on  by shit  too  but she  could  you could  actually  look at  what's wrong  with being  turned on  by other  things  you could  look at  her breasts  though  you don't  have to  look at  balloons  that's a  turn on  too  right  there's a  fantasy  fucking  world  too  Sam  you don't  do you  fantasize  not about  balloons  why not  because there's  pornography on 
[01:41:30]  the internet  that's too  easy  sometimes  the littlest  thing  and it's  unexpected  is a real  turn on  not balloons  balloons  I'm telling you  I'm telling you  I'm onto  something  wait till I  fucking make  some balloon  videos  guys will be  jerking off  all over the  place  I might have  giggled at it  when I was  very young  why  because I see  the resemblance  to boobies  but  once that was  passed  I was over it  what turns you  on Sam  women  besides that 
[01:42:00]  what do you  mean  what  just weird  shit  that you  see in  everyday  life  nothing  like  no  there's  no inanimate  objects  that  look like  you ever  go to the  supermarket  and get  turned on  by some  of the  fruits  and vegetables  no  things that  look like  lady parts  don't turn  me on  lady parts  turn me  on  what about  a taco  no  not a taco  because what  because there's  it's a  looks like a  pussy  yeah  fucking  hey man  you ever look  at a taco  lettuce  that's all  it has  there you

[01:43:30]  most of the  stuff i say  is right  so people  have to  agree with  it  but i agree  with you  on this  one  yeah  you don't  just get  turned on  by inanimate  objects that  appear to be  reproductive organs  oh no these  are shitty  flower paintings  they're horrible  who did these  georgia o'keefe  she's very very  famous  is she like  rich for this  shit  they're horrible  paintings  who cares  oh that looks  like a fucking  tight vagina  you missed the  tight vagina  one  right there  right there  the black  yeah  yeah

[01:44:30]  hands and knees  right  sticking up  and it was like  the type of pussy  that comes out  behind the legs  when they're on  their hands and  knees  it looks like  there's somebody  in the front  pushing the pussy  back between the  legs  it's fucking  outstanding  well i've  i've described  that as a  blown out  ball bag  yeah  put a fucking  m80 in your  ball bag  blow out  everything  and that's  the type of  pussy you like  oh god  wonderful  so yeah  i just thought  of that photo  if we were to  take a piece  of paper  and tape  two balloons  and print out  one of these  pictures 
[01:45:00]  that would  do it for you  well my mind  would certainly  wander  it would  wander  i'm just  making sure  i think you  have an  overactive  imagination  what's wrong  with that  sam  you guys  don't fantasize  about shit  yes  everybody  fantasizes  nobody  fantasizes  at a certain  age  looking at  balloons  i follow the  i like girls  daily thing  right  but then after a while  then i looked up  at the ceiling  and went  damn  no that's  that's an  underdeveloped  mind  no it's not  it certainly is  sam's right  yeah it is 
[01:45:30]  that's not the  sign of  of a mind  that's working  on fucking  all cylinders  no it's not  to look at  two balloons  and go  they look like  boobies  that's normal  no nobody  no adult  thinks that way  look at my boobie  fucking picture  i have it right here  close to my heart  i've looked at it  a few times today  i saw you tweet it  yesterday morning  what are you fantasizing  about sam  what are you doing  sam's a bore  no what do you  seriously what do you  think about  what would one of  your fantasies be  but give us a weird  one i gave you a weird  one it's easy to go  oh i look at naked

[01:51:00]  regular  he knows  why you  don't  fantasize  sad  let's go  to steven  connecticut  steve  good morning  boys  hey  what  what  flower  turns  on  that's  our  bit  today  no  flower  turns  anyone  on  this is  our  bit  today  we need  a bit  every day  a good  rose  nice and  soft  and silky  ugh  no rose  doesn't do it  either  no i was  thinking from a  uh from a  feeling perspective  although you know you get to the center of the rose  now or feeling  perspective you get to that  the center of the rose now you're talking a little bit  how about a venus fly trap  because it can keep  gripping your balls 
[01:51:30]  tickling them  well when i'm in my  submissive mode i guess that could work  hey you do radio with that voice of yours  uh no i just got a little bit of a call  i used to do radio when i was in college  uh you were smart you were one of the smart ones  for every one of us  no i didn't i didn't have the the nads you had sir  and well for everyone that made it there's hundreds of guys that just fucking  were smart to get out  that was my fear i didn't want to end up in iowa playing to corns  yeah good point  all right what do you got on sam's  corn erotic it's a plant  hydra 
[01:52:00]  it's like a hard arm with yellow stuff  hydrania  oh we did hydrangea  hydrangea i did it  hydrangea  you did not find it terribly erotic  isn't it hydrangea  no it's hydrangea  hydrangea  is there hydrangea  i need it to be drained  all right what do you got on sam fantasizing  this is why sam doesn't fantasize  because he's actually still getting laid  because he hasn't officially sealed the deal  with jess  once he's married that's all going to change  all i can think of when i heard you this morning opie with the flowers  is how the shop must still be closed 
[01:52:30]  no we're good  yeah oh all right  no we're good but i just like  i like fucking fantasizing  no but the thing with sam not is sam is still wearing rubbers  why would you put up with that  it's not it's it's i don't mind it  you do mind it  nobody likes putting rubbers on  a lot of people use protection  i sam that doesn't speak too much to the level of trust  i never minded using rubbers  to be completely honest with you  i just never minded it  i wish i didn't 
[01:53:00]  i just felt like i controlled the situation  because look at me  a lot of girls wanted my kids  well this is true  a lot man  so i was able to fucking control the situation  that's right you have such balloons and stuff  that's right  it was safer that way  yeah  but that's why uh sam  sam as soon as you ask someone  what when was the last time you jerked off  and what was it  people will have an answer immediately  sam had a fish  and i think he just came up with something  that wasn't true  if i had the answer  i said last week 
[01:53:30]  i said it was red tube or whatever website  red tube's a good one  yeah  you should do i like uh sex uh daily  i never follow those twitter accounts  oh they're great  they're not gonna show anything  that i can't just get on fucking x2  x2 x hamster are the best  i don't think about sex all the time though  ooh  why don't  why sam  it's just not on my mind that much  well you gotta save a little room in that brain for wrestling right  i think about wrestling  i bet i think about  do you think about wrestling more than sex 
[01:54:00]  yeah i think so  oh my god  i think so  i think that's probably accurate  i tell you what sam  for your wedding  i'll give you four complimentary sessions  and we can talk about  why you think about wrestling more than sex  what do you do for  are you a masseuse  sessions with you  yeah i want sam and this man to have some sessions  what kind of session  anything to do with this idiot  no i'm  it's steve the  why is he an idiot  oh you're the therapist guy  i i thought i recognized  do you want to go to therapy with steve  no  you need therapy sam  i am  you need therapy  i got therapy  i got therapy 
[01:54:30]  you obviously you shouldn't be bored at your therapist  you got shit to talk about  the balloon thing i would never even bring up  you should  that's that's basic shit  it's not basic  nobody does it  you should bring it up  you should bring up the balloon thing  and the flower thing  yes  if you tell you  if you can't look at a flower and see that it's sexual  you're fucking nuts  you can see it  and you're like oh  i'm not jerking off to flowers or balloons  i told you that  and that's the truth  that's the real answer  do you think that's a sign of emotional immaturity  yeah you said it's erotic  and first of all  looking up a balloon 
[01:55:00]  look up at the orchid  orchid  excuse me  look up the orchid  a lot of people say an orchid does it for them  i'm not alone on this  they're not saying it does it for them  they're saying there is a similarity  now put that side by side with a pussy  and you tell me you can't see the fucking resemblance  i understand that they look alike  that doesn't mean that  look at that orchid  i find it sexually gratifying  it has most of the parts of a woman  look there's the little clitty  no i see it  maybe sam doesn't have sex with the lights on  that could be why  on or off sam  on 
[01:55:30]  i prefer lights on  yeah i like looking at pimples and shit  and ass spiders  i like to see what's going on  all right i'm punching out  thanks guys  all right  maybe you should  seashells  see  this is what i'm talking about  steve  you  help me out  yo  have you guys ever looked at a big seashell  you know what i mean  you go by the water  pick one up  flip it around  i'm telling you right now  you can see  you can pound that thing  you can see vaginas  as you just walk through life  why would you have sex with a seashell 
[01:56:00]  you choose not to see fucking vaginas sam  why would you have sex with a seashell  you're not having sex  all of a sudden it's a little eroticism  it's not eroticism  it's added to your day  all of a sudden like  oh wow that's unexpected  that's nice  that looks like a nice tight pussy  there's plenty of eroticism in my day  right  if you're a dude  everything you see can remind you of a pussy  thank you sir  everywhere you walk  what's your favorite seashell that looks like a pussy  jesus christ  i'm telling you my people are out there sam  huh  i can't come up with one right off the top of my head  but i know i've seen a few  you walk down the beach 
[01:56:30]  you flip one over  it's got to be a bigger one  you flip it over and take a look at it  also  it's like a penthouse  also the tight clam  that's open just slightly  with a little  a little of the clam meat  it's falling out  it's got to be like a conch  or a  you know  something bigger  yeah  i'm telling you  yeah  yeah  sam's missing out  i'm not missing out  i understand the premise  and why  like i don't want to fuck a conch shell  but  you said  look at the pink of that  i understand  right there  it looks like a vagina  i'm not like  no the eroticism of that  is look at that 
[01:57:00]  nice pink color  it's not erotic  it's that nice  light pink color  the problem is  that you looked up  at two balloons  on the ceiling  and thought of boobies  i certainly did  and i'm sticking to it  i just retweeted the picture  if you don't see boobies  in that fucking picture  there's something wrong with you  you said it did a little  something for you  it was erotic  and chubbed you up  a little bit  roland what turns you on  a little eroticism  is it like seashells  flowers  or balloons  qvc  what  you have those ladies  on there  so if you want to 
[01:57:30]  rub one out  you rub one out  to the qvc  but see that makes sense  because it's a girl  that's fine  because there's a bunch  of girls  and sometimes you see  their nipples  you're like  ah what the fuck  and you just rub one out  but that's not  an inanimate object  see at least he's being  honest but  but he's on topic  not everything has to be  like a porn scene  to get your mind  going a little bit  there sam  well if i see an  attractive woman on  qvc  scallop  thank you john  i gotta get rid of you  because i got john now  uh go ahead john  scallop right  yeah scallop  they got the beard  and the fucking hair 
[01:58:00]  that comes out  and everything  the beard  yeah if you look at  a scallop that's  just open  they got a bunch of  uh little hairs  that come out  it's fucking hot  there's nothing hot  about that  well that's a bit  you picked the worst  picture of the scallop  wouldn't you hate  to put your dick in there  and have it clamped shut  look at that  that looks like a  that looks like a  pussy that has seen  some time  uh huh  look at that  turn it sideways sam  is that a scallop  yeah look at that  those guys are delicious 
[01:58:30]  yeah  i hate scallops  no  it's a texture thing  it fucking feels weird  in my mouth  i don't like scallops  you like them with  butter rolling  i love them with butter  you love scallops  i love scallops  i love seafood  but i don't like scallops  never have  if they're cooked  the right way  they're delicious  what's that texture  it tastes like  you're eating  like a sponge  or something  that's good man  that's good  i love a good scallop  it tastes like  it has the texture  of like fat  yeah  i don't like that  if you like burn-ins  and like bone marrow  you love scallops 
[01:59:00]  i never  bone marrow scares me  who the fuck likes bone marrow  it's delicious  you can put in bread  not when you could have a steak  why would you eat bone marrow  you can put in the bread  it's right there  it's delicious  no no  flavor  what  you can put in a piece of bread  you get the little bone marrow  put on top of the bread  alright see  now the phone's lit sam  sorry you're wrong on this one  i'm not wrong  and jimmy tapped out  i don't blame him  i understand that things look like vaginas  that doesn't make them a turn-on  jimmy's talking about osama bin laden's last days  and i'm talking about what the balloons that look like boobies 
[01:59:30]  i got it  that's the beauty of this show  brian what do you got buddy  there's actually a flower out there called clitoria  see they even name them after pussy shit  i got it  they look like vaginas  well look up clitoria  yeah if you don't like it you're gay  is that what it is  yes let's look up the clitoria  there you go  jimmy  a little bit  punch it out  yeah i'm not saying there's a lot of things that look like cunts  that's what i'm saying  yes it looks  clitoria  but that doesn't make it  that doesn't  they couldn't even name that anything else 
[02:00:00]  they had to name it clitoria  because it looks exactly like a pussy  but i don't find it stimulating  it's not erotic  it's just like oh there's a flower that looks like a vagina  yeah i think there's something wrong with you  you don't have a good imagination  yeah  i don't need to look  i'm not saying you fuck the flower  or pull out your penis and start jerking off  but you're walking through life going  oh all right look at this  every time something looks like a vagina  yeah  you should stop and fucking note that  oh all right  there's vaginas all around us  no i understand  i want to do a kid show about that  vaginas are everywhere  sure 
[02:00:30]  i want to call it vaginas are everywhere  very good  uh flowers are sex parts too by the way  for who  that's uh that really is a pussy  no it's not  it's a flower  in nature that's a pussy  let's go to gary  gary what's up  hey morning  morning  well like  flowers are the sex parts  i work at a garden center  and yesterday it was like  out of control with milk  you look at their tits  and you look down at the flowers  and you would look at their vaginas 
[02:01:00]  and you'd just be like  hey all this shit  kind of looks similar enough  that it's making you think  you know  it'll turn you on a little  cool  a guy who works in a garden  jerks off to flowers  that's good  i'm the one who's weird  you want to read my  my twitter  i'm not even joking  has exploded  angel four  the number four medal  just sent me a picture  tell me that doesn't look like  a fucking pussy  it looks like a vagina  i understand  right  so why aren't you turned on by that  you don't like vaginas  not every single one 
[02:01:30]  that exists  now people just sending me  pictures of flowers  that look like vaginas  are you very stimulated by that  has that added some  eroticism to your day  yeah it made me a little  happier today  just a little bit  a little blood rush down  to the crotch area  i don't have a full chubby  or nothing like that  no  yeah i'm gonna keep my dick  in my pants  but right now i'm feeling  just a little happier  a little feeling inside  somebody writes  in support of opie's flower  is sexual stance  where do you think  deflowering a virgin came from  there you go  i mean there probably is a 
[02:02:00]  look at this flower  i heard sam is partial  to the odd pansy  that made me laugh  mark in buffalo  mark in buffalo  marking it with what  look at that one  go to his twitter  wow  that  jimmy even said wow  right  because how it was shot even  you look quick  you're not even sure  if it's a pussy or a flower  that flower looks like a vagina  you gotta shoot it properly  there you go  why don't you just take  a picture of a vagina  wow i'm gonna have to  retweet this one  that one's fucking hot sam  it's not hot 
[02:02:30]  yeah that's more  than a turn on  there's  there's something  going on there  yeah  alright  does sam like  fish dicks in his mouth  that's a good one  south park  really didn't get enough  out of that  a year and a half ago  fish dicks  yeah  let's say hi to  ed in kansas  ed  hey  a smoked oyster  hold it up  and it's got lips  and all  see these guys  are coming out  of the woodwork sam  obviously they do not  have very fulfilled lives 
[02:03:00]  that they have to  look around  and figure out  what looks like  vaginas around them  no  we just  we just find happiness  when  when we're just  walking about  sam  look up  dendrophilia  is that the desire  to fuck trees  uh  d-e-n-d-r-o  i think so  yeah  i would never  i would  i just want to know  somebody twittered it  so is dendrophilia  the desire to fuck trees  yeah  who wants to fuck a tree  is that a real thing  would you maybe opie  fuck a tree  if it looked like  if it had a hole 
[02:03:30]  that looked like  a vagina  if the knot hole  looked like a pussy  and there was like  a lot of sap  and honey sapling  leaking out  like a wet pussy  the problem with trees  is  i have thought of this  by the way  if you want an answer  the problem with trees  the bark makes it look  like very old pussy  so i'm not really  turned on by that  i understand  what's it called sam  can you read what that is  oh and i've seen old pussy  yeah  yeah we all have  it literally means  love of trees  the term may sometimes  refer to a  paraphilia  in which people  are sexually attracted  or sexually aroused 
[02:04:00]  by trees  this may involve  sexual contact  or veneration  as phallic symbols  or both  what happened  yep dendrophilia  is when people  want to fuck a tree  so what's wrong  with that  a lot  it's a tree  i'm kidding  that's where i'm out  for real  that's where you  draw the line  don't want to fuck  that tree  i don't want to  fuck any of this stuff  you wanted  you got a little  excited by the balloons  that look like boobies  yeah  and and mark 
[02:04:30]  in buffalo's  picture of a flower  that he just tweeted  absolutely  yep here we go  yep frank in rhode island  frank  yes hi guys  i'm a little snappy  folding napkins  on the table  holding giant badges  what  yeah man  you go to a wedding  or something  and they fold  the nap  they're doing that  on purpose  to make you  a little happier  exactly  stick it in  stick it in  there you go  fucking pull it out 
[02:05:00]  and pump it  and stick it in  let's go to mark  mark  semi  semi  marky  mark  yeah  what's up buddy  how are you pal  i'm doing good man  hey listen  i just wanted to say  that uh  people that are our age  compared to today's age  i think have a better imagination  because back when we were younger  things weren't as exposed  they were covered up  so you used your imagination 
[02:05:30]  and compared things  like for example  a nice script w  looks like a nice  in the boobs  if you do it right  see  yeah that's fine  but you're now  in 2012  where you don't have  to jerk off  to the letter w  that's the problem  i'm married for 30 years  i'm very happy  so  good  yeah sam  i'm a child of the 80s  you're a child of the 90s  you're not a child of the 80s  first of all  and that 10 year difference  there's not a 10 year difference  between us  that 10 year difference  was a big difference  obviously  after the first break 
[02:06:00]  me and jimmy  were walking to the bathroom  man we were talking about  porn and stuff  and how hard it was  just to find porn  when we were growing up  that's what mark is getting at  i get that  so we had to use our  we couldn't find porn all the time  so you used your imagination  went wow  that flower looks like  a fucking vagina  that doesn't mean  wow look at those balloons  they look like firm boobies  that in 2012  you should be looking  at your ceiling  and getting just a tiny bit  turned on  that two balloons  look like boobies  next to each other  nothing wrong with it  i didn't lose my imagination 
[02:06:30]  you should find yours sir  i have an imagination  there's a guy saying  there's a piece of coral  in his salt water  thank you mark  i'm actually  i want to take kevin's call  uh kevin what's up buddy  hey how are you guys  all right  i got a  i just saw it  in a salt water aquarium  and i have this  you gotta google it  it's an open  face brain coral  it looks like a  fucking pussy  and when you  when you tickle it  to feed it  it'll swell up  like a slit  see  this is happening sam  i believe that 
[02:07:00]  and you're not  pulling out your dick  but it makes your day  a little happier  when you see the  fucking coral  in your tank  right  you say rain coral  what is it called  open-faced brain coral  brain  open-faced  brain coral  yeah it's got  lipstick  and when you  when you  when you  when you  when you  when you  the center  it looks like  a clip  it starts  it starts moving  and then it ends up  eating the  you know  the shrimp  or whatever  oh yeah it does  it does eat  that shrimp  look at that  sam  you can't find 
[02:07:30]  uh  well that's  that's a close up  the argument is not  whether or not  plants look like  vaginas at times  they do  of course they do  but a lot of  things look like  vaginas  but doesn't that  like uh  make you look  just a little  uh  i could give a shit  a little hornier  a little happier  no it doesn't make me  at all hornier  to know that there's  a flower that looks  like a vagina  that i just walked by  why would it  depresses me  for the flower  it's supposed to  look like something  that is so  fucking smelly 
[02:08:00]  and i'm definitely  not looking  i'm definitely  not looking  for cylindrical  shaped  objects  to put them  next to each other  so i can see boobies  i'm not looking  for it either  but if all of a sudden  it appears out of nowhere  it's gonna be  a little nice thing  it's not appearing out of nowhere  you had balloons  on your ceiling  dude i saw the balloons  on the ceiling  and i just put my head  back and went  whoa  and i was  happily surprised  who's talking  oh maybe the door  is open  or crack  let's see  open the door 
[02:08:30]  oh okay  i heard  no i wasn't  oh yeah  so i'm taking  a phone call  that's that's  probably a clue  you know  a cue to take  a break  i gotta tinkle  you think so  yeah we gotta tinkle  we gotta look at  more flowers  that look like  pussies  um  i'm surprised  the ladies  didn't get involved  i'm not  you just showed  a tree  that looked  like a penis  i'm thinking  if i'm thinking  the ladies  got one or two  out there  they get a little  horned up  when they see  a tree  that looks  like a penis  i bet you  they do  a hot dog  whoa 
[02:09:00]  look at that  i don't know  we might have  to ask the ladies  you don't think  they do so  no  why would they  it's a hot dog  sam i could have  taken easily  ten more calls  i believe you  they're out there  that's not to say  i got my people  in there agreeing  with me  at this point  you don't have  any people  agreeing with you  you can come  to the realization  that a flower  looks like a vagina  and move on  with your life  it's not exciting  every time  but it does nothing  to you  no it's a flower  i don't want to  have a fucking  relationship with it 
[02:09:30]  well what does it  do to you  just like  horned you up  a little bit  just a little bit  makes your day  a little more horny  a little bit  just a little bit  i don't need my day  to be any more horny  you do go through  your life  on some kind of  level of horniness  you do realize that  right  that's fair  all right  but i don't need  an increase  based on plant life  if you get  you know  a little pep  in your step  slightly hornier  guess what  you're not going to  yell at anybody  for a little while  but plant life  doesn't do it to me  no  what does it for you  women 
[02:10:00]  yeah that's the  number one for all  of us  the qvc thing  there's other shit  no there isn't  other shit after  women  it's just women  the qvc thing  i'm completely  with roland  because it's an  attractive female  but the qvc lady  was selling flowers  and he was  oh look at that  flower  that's a little  horny  no  yeah i would  make the  connection  quickly  that the  woman selling  the flowers  her vagina  looks like  that flower  that would be  that would be  a double one  that's like  that would be  really good 
[02:10:30]  that's what  something like  a nine-year-old  would do  but once that's  over  it's over  all right  you live through  life being bored  then  i'm not bored  at all  yeah you are  i'm not  all right  um  i don't know  well time  magazine with  breastfeeding  tyler on cover  stirs debate  yeah we did  that  we did that  a lot of  people talked  about that  all weekend  long  is that on  the list  for show  prep  no it's  stories from  yesterday i  guess  and the 
[02:11:00]  virgin we  did that  let's see  yeah well  we could get  into the  the travolta  thing certainly  and the  avengers made  another 103  million over the  weekend  is that in  america  that's in  america  it's made a  billion dollars  globally  we talked to  anyone from  that movie  uh you did  and i did  actually  did we talk to  any uh  superheroes  no but i  spoke to a  super villain  you spoke to  an agent  so was my  interview like  more important  than yours  no

[02:13:00]  ever seen on a kid  yeah look at all  right it's wow on an  ipad sort of yeah  all right i'm sorry  yeah i'm just looking  at his ears i thought  he was a normal kid  with big ears i'm  all i'm all in with  that shit but when  there's real shit  going on in his head  all right he still  has gigantic ears he  has massive ears  because he's sick  because he just  because he's got  cerebral palsy doesn't  mean that his ears  are not gigantic oh  sam you made a  little fucking joke  there did you yeah  and and someone  tweeted me that if  you put two ears 
[02:13:30]  together it looks  like a vagina great  so let's do this  let's put ears  together to look  we put roland and  eric's ears together  and we'll uh tweet a  picture of it and i  swear to christ  we should put their  ears together under a  truck tire  someone should send  me a picture even if  you put two ears  together it looks like  a vagina  lots of things look  like vaginas  but you're not  turned on by it  no no all right go  through your boring  existence i don't get  what is the national 
[02:14:00]  math competition some  kid just won the  national math competition  what do they do there  they do problems  mathematics five times  five twenty five  you're the champion  i think it's more  involved than that  thousand dollars  scholarship check  congratulations  how are you i'm fine  how were you nervous  yeah i was very nervous  describe the nerves  chad kian or kwan  um well  heart pounding  goosebumps 
[02:14:30]  it was mainly heart  pounding i i mean  tinta like a calm  expression a facial  expression but my heart  was pounding  to intimidate your  opponents  you had your game  face on  yeah  how long did it  take you to come  up with with 21  because i would be  here all day  probably like 10  seconds or something  10 seconds  what's the answer  is it an easy way  to explain  um wow  no  and that's a no  that's a no  god i thought we were  boring people today  but wait what is the 
[02:15:00]  i want to know  what the  calculator  totally cheating  when did you start  loving math  how old  since i was a very  small boy  oh ted you love math  i certainly do gregory  were you part of the  math fucking competition  i wanted five years in a  row  really  five plus two  seven  not bad  thank you trophy  please  but but don't the uh  don't the problems get  more complicated than  that ted  my mathematical skills  are unparalleled  you give me a math 
[02:15:30]  problem and i'll give you  an answer  that's what i do  samuel  all right  nine divided by  tree  it certainly does  and divides very well  whole bunch  what's the answer  three  three times three is  nine  nine  oh no  three is the square  root of nine  what about  nine times three is  twenty seven  nine plus three is  twelve  nine minus three is  six  nines and threes are  my specialty gregory  as long as they're  nines and threes  you're okay  what about 
[02:16:00]  nine next to three  looks like ninety  three  unless you flip it  it's thirty nine  what's six plus seven  i wouldn't know  i don't deal with  those two numbers  what  nines and threes  i said samuel  what about  three divided  into nine  i already said  that one  i only answer  a question  one time  it goes in  three times  well there's not  many other  fucking examples  left  i won the national  dance championship  on the three  nine category  how about  thirty nine  times three  i wouldn't know  i only deal with  threes and nines  is singular numbers 
[02:16:30]  or how they look  together  nine over three  looks like a  nine over three  three minus nine  yes you can't do  that negative six  you bag of shit  you knew that  like a personal  uh remember i said  john montone talked  to a guy that was  pissed off about uh  obama being on the  cover as the first  gay president  yes  yes  i believe this guy  took it a bit  literally  well the actual 
[02:17:00]  first black president  has been declared  the first gay president  on the cover of  newsweek  10 10 wins newsman  john montone's out  and about this  morning finding out  what new yorkers  think about that  in this report  from times square  john  a fellow visiting  from france  appeared lost  as i tried to  explain the  magazine cover  finally he said  obama  he is not gay  and  did you hear that  yeah  it's very  the guy felt like  he had to tell 
[02:17:30]  the world that  obama actually  isn't gay  it's a riveting  news story  oh my god  he is not  gay  and con ed workers  tim and jay say  newsweek's just  trying to sell  magazines  so if you see this  on the newsstand  you're gonna pick it  up  i might pick it up  but i won't buy it  and you're gonna buy it  i'll pick it up  and try to read it  in a magazine  until uh  they tell me  i have to buy it  then i'll eventually  i'll look it up  on the internet  a police officer  here who laughed  long and hard  when i showed him 
[02:18:00]  the magazine cover  then turned serious  saying obama is  giving everyone  their right to  express themselves  which is what  this country  is about  john montone  10-10 wins  it was a different one  it was a little earlier  earlier in the morning  a man from france  said he's not gay  how does he have a job  i like john montone  how does he do that  i could do that  yeah he's got a very easy job  jesus  and he just has to do 
[02:18:30]  one story a day  the police officer laughed  and then didn't  yeah he just has to do  one a day  terrific  it was the one from earlier  though where a guy  actually said  he's not gay  he's married  he has kids  that was the dummy  i was hoping we'd play  but those guys  are pretty good too  that guy was right though  they're pretty much  taking it literally as well  so  yeah but still  montone did a story  from fort lee  new jersey last week  we didn't get to  they are now  going to give tickets  to anyone that is  walking and texting  oh yeah 
[02:19:00]  i did hear  i saw that on the news  how do you feel  about that shit  it's disgusting  how about walking  and reading  is that okay  right  how about walking  and you know  how do blind people  allow to walk  right  how the fuck  do blind people  permitted to walk  i had a  i had a  i had to do that  the other day  i had to walk  a blind woman  across the street  we had a nice  little chat  about the whole thing  what did she say to you  so what's it like  to have eyes  and you said  it's pretty fucking good  i was just talking  about the weather  i figure they could  they understand  that it's a nice day 
[02:19:30]  or smells  you should just  talk about smells  yeah have you had  one of those yet  walking around new york  we all get them  yeah i have  i've walked one  across the street  all of a sudden  you're just at  for money  you're at a corner  and all of a sudden  you hear a voice  from the side  excuse me  could someone help me  and you see this thing  hitting everything  with the stick  yeah stick  hitting dog shit  in sewer water  and then bringing it  into her apartment  nice stick dick  so i got one  the other day  it's been a while  knocking everybody's  fucking feet  with her stick  yeah  tap tap tap tap 
[02:20:00]  tap tap tap tap  yeah they get a little  aggressive with their stick  i would hate to be blind  i don't know how the fuck  blind people get around  i watched the guy  by himself  get into the subway  i was amazed  by the whole thing  do you just  do you just  memorize everything  in your  in your little neighborhood  i don't know  how the fuck  do they know  not standing too close  to the track  this guy was  i watched him  do two blocks  without asking for help  and using that stick  he found the subway entrance  and he went down  down underground  to get his subway 
[02:20:30]  i don't  i don't even  i can't comprehend that  no i can't either  i think you just  gotta memorize  how many steps it is  you just start  knowing landmarks  with your stick  blind people  that go out  and buy shit  god bless them  and then come back  and uh  i just don't know  how you do it  i don't either  i don't understand  the ones that are  independent  good  you know  god bless you  but uh  they're  they're gonna now  um  give you a ticket  for for walking  and texting  i think that's  ridiculous  and the reason  why it's ridiculous 
[02:21:00]  is because  they're just  trying to find money  they don't give a fuck  about our safety  and if you get hit  because you're texting  so be it  it's your fucking problem  yeah it's not mine  you wanna know  what the question was  at the math contest  yeah  yeah  i could probably  answer the question  i used to be good at this  he did this in 10 seconds  10 seconds  well maybe not  he said 10  but he's probably lying  alright  a bag of coins  containing only  pennies 
[02:21:30]  nickels  and dimes  okay  that's one  and fives  and tens  okay  with at least  five of each  so pennies  and nickels  and dimes  there's at least  75  80 cents  how  has  how many  different  combined  values  if five coins  were selected  at random  yeah  oh my god  oh 21 
[02:22:00]  21  I see the face  you know what happened  what  yeah  he heard the kid  answering on television  no he didn't  yes he did  no he didn't  yes you did  why  he's smiling  as he's  tensively touching  his tooth  it's falling apart  why can't you  why can't you  stay stoic  I just added  all the values  together  because I'm laughing  that you guys  think that I  didn't know the answer  I was a math  part of you  as he casually  touched his chin 
[02:22:30]  yeah so much  how you think  yeah  21  how did you  come to 21  just show your work  why are you smiling  again  because I like to  have everybody  be followed  with my skills  21  why do you fall  apart so easily  I'm not falling apart  I'm just laughing  that nobody else  knew that  the answer is  indeed 21  I know  how do they get  to 21  you just gotta add  up the values  of what  just the coins  what was the  question again  yeah make sure  I got it right  a bag of coins  yeah I know  pennies diggles  and dimes  there's at least 
[02:23:00]  five of age  I got it  I got it  I got it  I got it  I got it  I got it  how many different  combinations if  how many different  combined values  if five coins  were selected  at random  five  so you take  five  I just did it  slowly  I said  okay  five coins  five nickels  would be 25 cents  right  that's one value  so yeah  five dimes  there's already three  there's automatically  three  because you have 
[02:23:30]  he's right  if you grab five  dimes  five nickels  five pennies  there's three  and then there's  automatically  hold on  so that's three  now we need 18 more  so there's six  combinations per  per monetary  coin  now there's three  right there  and then there's  automatically  right  two dimes  right  two nickels  and one  so that's  four five six  boom boom boom  just go down the line  so you do that  seven times  seven times three  you get the 21  me and Jimmy  are fucking  brilliant 
[02:24:00]  you did it  so where's our  fucking trope  faster than that  though  yeah I'm just  showing you slowly  how my mind works  I'm slowing down  my mind  oh  I gotta  I gotta ask  the listener  something please  why the fuck  was that soccer  game such a big  deal  that's all  that's the  question today  and I want an  answer  do you know  they're showing  that soccer game  I don't even know  who played  but I know  everyone is talking  about it today  why  why 
[02:24:30]  and why don't  we like soccer  in America  but people will  argue we do  at this point  we don't  we don't give  a fuck  why  I need that  question answered  today  why  I try  I like sports  in general  I try  I don't  understand  soccer  still  is it because  the whole world  plays it  it's the biggest  sport in the world  but it just doesn't  interest me at all  it's a dickhead 
[02:25:00]  kicking a ball  around  oh  boo  I think a lot  of people just  watch soccer  because the rest  of the world  does and they  don't want to  seem like  ignorant Americans  I don't know  man I know  there's a whole  culture in America  that really like  their soccer  I see these bars  in my neighborhood  but mostly in the  village Jimmy  where you go down  for the comedy  central and all that  there's a lot of  bars in that area  that cater to the  soccer fans for  these fucking games  and they start 
[02:25:30]  like early in the  morning obviously  because they're  being played  somewhere else  and these places  get fucking  packed and then  people are outside  these bars looking  in the window  just to try to  watch  is it a lot of  tourists like  Europeans that  come over  he's all foreigners  yeah  phones are lit  eroticism in  nature and soccer  we're doing good  today  Kev in New York  City what's up  hey what's up  alright so the  deal with this  weekend was this  yeah Manchester  United and  Manchester City  are both in the  same city pretty 
[02:26:00]  much  who are rivals  it's pretty much  like the  Islanders and  the Rangers  or Yankees  Mets right  or Yankees  Mets  someone even  said I heard  this much from  the morning Joe  he said it's  like a Yankees  Red Sox thing  as well  yeah but they  don't watch  Yankees Red Sox  in England  but I'm trying  to relate to it  so the one guy  said well look  at it this way  you know the  rivalry between  the Yankees  and the Red Sox  it's like that  but these two  teams play in  Manchester  it's like  frickin'  frack  so I guess 
[02:26:30]  the Islander  Ranger thing  would be a  biggie  yes  so  Manchester City  has a better  team  now  they've been  winning the  whole season  and then they  lost the lead  in soccer  there's no  playoffs  it's just  whatever it is  at the end  of the season  that's a champion  so it all  came down  to the end  of the  last Sunday's  game  where both  teams  had the same  exact amount  of wins  but the blue  team  Manchester City  had more goals  had a larger 
[02:27:00]  goal differential  no  and I'm not  I'm not trying  to be  I'm with you  oh Jimmy  of course he is  got it  so what  it came back  to this  it came back  to one game  Manchester United  had a win  and Manchester City  had to either  lose  and or tie  so when  Manchester United  game ended  they were winning  Manchester City  was losing  their game  in the last  three minutes  of the game  Manchester City 
[02:27:30]  came back  and scored  two goals  which gave them  the championship  so they won it  pretty much  in two minute  time  which is crazy  in soccer  because that's  why I hate  the fucking sport  there's not enough  scoring for me  oh it's awful  any sport  and I know  it's a hack  bit but it is  true  any sport  where they  could go to  commercial  while the game  is still being  played  that's a dumb  game  by the way  that's why  it didn't  take off  in this country  they know  that they're  not going  to miss  much  so they  actually  keep playing  as the 
[02:28:00]  commercials  are playing  but that's  why they don't  because they  don't know  how to show  it  there's no  breaks in  soccer  right sir  no  no breaks  only during  halftime  for 15 minutes  that's why  in America  we've got to  monetize  everything  I guess  it was a  big game  then  huh  yeah  it was  probably  like  a Super Bowl  Sunday  in a way  for the  British Premier League  and the  English Premier League  is one of the  best soccer leagues  yeah  it's probably  they have  the most  competitive  teams  and then you  have  La Liga  which is 
[02:28:30]  where Messi  plays  and Barcelona  Barcelona  and Real  Madrid  are the only  really two  good teams  in that league  and the rest  of the league  is pretty much  shit  so  really  and then  the Italian  league  is a bunch  of freaking  prima donnas  who tithe  all over the  place  that are  Italian  you know  what you want  but they're  lovers  they love  it  yeah  I mean  they're  maniacs  all right  yeah I guess  did you watch  yeah I watch  yeah I watch  every morning  I usually go  down to  Nevada Smith's  or football  factory  and watch 
[02:29:00]  all the games  at 7am  and these  places are  packed right  yeah they're  packed  yeah  they're  I mean  big games  they're really  crowded  and like  beginning of the  season  it's only like  the degenerate  fans will wake  up to want to  watch these  matches and  whatnot  so and  it's every  weekend  yeah it's  every weekend  yeah  no I mean  every weekend  morning so  the games are  being played  what in the  afternoon  over across  the pond  yeah across  the pond  it's like  you get a  1 o'clock  start I think  it is  and like  4 o'clock  so here it's 
[02:29:30]  like 7 o'clock  game a 10 o'clock  game and like  11  1130 12 o'clock  game  man people love  it so why  don't you watch  American soccer  um because  it's like  watching the  Premier League  and then watching  MLS  it's kind of  like going  that's like  your local  like watching  8 year olds  play  they're not  there's not  as good  it's fun  no  but you're  from America  so I would  assume if you're  into the sport  you'd watch  the American  version of it  is that dumb  yeah I mean  sometimes I do  a Red Bull  game just  because there's  nothing else 
[02:30:00]  to really watch  so how is  America gonna  finally embrace  soccer like  they do over  there  I don't think  it's gonna  happen  mainly because  people have  no patience  to watch  the game  for 90  minutes  right  but  but the  American soccer  I don't even  know what it's  called  what is  what are they  called  MSL  MLS  I mean  MLS  so uh  but people  are going  to the games  they're selling  out right  no they're 
[02:30:30]  pretty much  only selling  out when  the LA  Galaxy  play  the Red  Bulls  which is  T.R.E.  who came  from Arsenal  right  and David  Peckle  plays for the  Galaxy  right  people just  want to go  see those two  guys run  around the field  with Donovan  on the Galaxy  and that's  pretty much the  reason why they  sell out  but in the other  game it's pretty  much empty  you know there's  no one really  there  god  all right  all right  I know a little  more today  Kev thank you  you got it  all right buddy  have a good  day  you got any  more on that  I think we  got Quiznos

[02:38:30]  we spent  a lot  of time  on John  Travolta  last week  and one  of the  accusers  his lawyer  said I  can't  represent  you  because  you got  your  date  wrong  he got  because  basically  John Travolta  had an  alibi  that he  was in  New York  at Mr.  Chow's  and he  was at  some other  event taking  pictures with  fans and  that was the  day that all  that shit  went down  that we  talked about  last week  and all of a  sudden the  masseur goes  oh fuck  I got the  day wrong  and he might  be legit and  telling the  truth  he might have 
[02:39:00]  fucking  really made  fucked up  and gave his  lawyer the  wrong date  but the  lawyer's like  I can't  defend this  now  here's a  theory  they'll kill  you in court  here's a  theory  if you don't  have your  dates right  and this  theory may  be totally  wrong  yeah  it was just  something somebody  said to me  which made me  go oh  but again it  could be  complete nonsense  I've heard that  Travolta  or the theory  was that Travolta  wanted to leave  Scientology  and they are  I guess pushing  this stuff  to show him 
[02:39:30]  who's boss  right  and again it could  be total conspiracy  theory nonsense  and I would  never have  given that  much credence  but then all  of a sudden  the guy's  lawyer  drops him  what kind  of lawyer  drops you  because you  got the  date wrong  how does  the lawyer  drop you  because you  made a mistake  on the date  because I think  it would be  tough to prove  in court  because they  could keep  going with  that  yeah but why  not just  refile  I don't know  I mean a lawyer  should call us  we have plenty 
[02:40:00]  of those assholes  listening to us  and explain  I think it just  makes it really  tough  but that to me  boosted the  Scientology claim  because what  if they  either put  what if  let's just say  for the sake  of total  conjecture  and speculation  that they put  the masseur up  to it  getting the  date wrong  on purpose  purposely  putting a  bad date  so knowing  that it would  take a little  while for him  to come out  and publicly  prove that  yeah the  date was wrong  but that's  the shot  fired across  the bow  like  we get this 
[02:40:30]  guy to come  out  he gives  all this  information  it's  embarrassing  but you  can skate  how  because his  date is  wrong  the lawyer  will drop  wow that's  some conspiracy  shit  it really  is  it only takes  a couple of  people to be  involved  doesn't take  a lot  you know  somebody in  Scientology  a lawyer  and a masseur  or only two  of those  three  why would  he want  to leave  Scientology  I don't  even know  if he would  it's just  speculation  I'm a  Catholic  but not  a practicing  Catholic  so who  cares  you didn't  make that  decision  in adulthood  to go  to it  I believe 
[02:41:00]  he made  the decision  to go  you didn't  join  Catholicism  later in  life  you just  kind of  raise  this part  of your  DNA  whereas  this stuff  you kind  of  it's a  scary  organization  that Scientology  thing  not as much  anymore  I mean  they can hurt  you badly  but with  the internet  and with  the way  you can  get  stuff  out there  quickly  I think  it's  harder  for them  to ruin  your life  than it  used to  be  because  there's  so  many  ways  for you  to speak  your case  you hear  all this  shit  about them  that you  probably  didn't hear  15-20 
[02:41:30]  years ago  I know  very little  about them  that's not  a bad  theory  though  apparently  it was  on gay  websites  and it  really was  relayed  to me  by somebody  I'm not  just  pretending  to have  relayed  it  and read  it  somebody  told me  that  so I  could  be  getting  it  wrong  maybe  has  anybody  else  heard  that  those  phones  are not  lighting up  so I'm assuming  no one's heard that  yeah but if we talk about  flowers looking like  pussies they'll light up again  that's true  if it makes you feel better  I could get those phones to light up  if you could then I'll throw in the  Travolta question  alright what about  what about  the ladies 
[02:42:00]  with their  eroticism  no it's not  yeah  why not  grown women are not  turned on by phallic shaped  objects  they sure are  saying  just seeing them  they're just a little shy  right now  they'll call me before the end of the show  why did troy steal half the sandwiches  troy  he's outside probably flirting with monica right now  i hate the sound proof  troy  who's monica  she's that girl out there  with the white pants  she does a lot of our production 
[02:42:30]  troy was just whipping her chair around  you wish anthony was here to do this bit  what's going on  hopefully anthony will be back tomorrow  he's gotta get a doctor's note  he's gonna be livid  yeah what's up troy  he's gonna be livid  stop looking at his dick  it's so weird  every time i come in here he stares at my dick  i heard this uh  during the weekend  uh yeah that  it was relayed to me when  jimmy does  chip  uh  chip likes to look at  everyone's dick in the studio  but there will  there'll be times that i'll come into the studio 
[02:43:00]  and he won't even  he'll be in chip character  but not saying anything  he's just staring at my cock  is that true  you're lying  and he talks  so jimmy's not looking at you  stop fucking lying  and chip brings up troy's dick  sit up  no i don't  it's fucking lies  what do you think of his dick  i don't think nothing about it  i don't give a fuck how really big it is  i don't care  can i talk to jim for a second  sure  does chip like uh  looking at guys dick  you have to ask chip  i don't understand what chip does  yeah but he's gonna be in denial  alright can i talk to chip for a second  yeah  wow hi

[02:44:00]  looking at penises  well i'm sure he's being truthful  can i talk to chip for a second  what's that  it seems that you like dick  i don't like dick  you like dicks  what's that  i don't know  it's something on your pants  oh my god  that's so weird  see you're staring right at  troy's dick  i'm not  but you don't like dick  i was looking at his shoes  he's still doing it  i was looking at his shoes  they're red  no but your eyes were lifting up  toward the couch  they weren't  they were  i was just trying to talk to sam  hi sam  he's doing it again  jim  yeah  we're not getting anywhere with chip 
[02:44:30]  chip is new  we kind of want to know if chip likes dick  i don't think so  he's never indicated any homosexual desires to me  okay  i mean i've never heard chip talk about that stuff  or think about that stuff  when you're jim you're not looking at troy's dick  but  no i have no interest in troy's dick at all  but as soon as i ask for chip  he's looking at troy  you're looking at his dick again  i'm not  yes you are  i'm looking right at you  you're looking at my dick  i'm not  yes you are  you're covering it  how did you know that  i just saw where his hands were  troy why uh

[02:47:00]  um  i don't really get  light like house music  but on the lighter side  oh i thought you meant  the band lighthouse  there's a band lighthouse  yeah  well unfortunately  yeah  yeah  what was their big song  life house it was the  name  i think  oh yeah  oh life house  but i was with you on  it  you're right  roland you can't sing  the uh  the dawson creek uh  song properly  i don't know  that's what sam told me  how do you sing it  i don't want to wait  for life to remember 
[02:47:30]  the stories of yesterday  i don't want to wait  for your lives and stories  remember  we'll be fine  someday  he just gets to  i don't want to wait  for our lives  right  and then he makes up  the rest of the lyrics  oh that's all made up  that's none of those  are the right lyrics  give it your all now though  that was my all  no give it your all  like lean into the mic  i want to hear it  now i'm singing  how you think it's  supposed to be heard  i don't want to wait  for your life to remember 
[02:48:00]  the stories about yesterday  i don't want to wait  for your life to remember  the way that we were  yeah  i hear he walks around  singing it like that  yeah  in the elevator  in the hallway  yeah  should he sing along  with this  with the theme  no you can't keep up  with that  oh that's a different version  that's the later years  who cares  we don't need to do that  okay  we don't need to do that sam 
[02:48:30]  what's the documentary  on youtube about  from uh  the guy in natus  chaos  yeah  he writes uh  check  to me and you he writes  check out the documentary  on youtube about them  stalking and ruining lives  those people suck  oh  scientology  okay  yeah supposedly they have a group  that just  keeps dirt on all their members  that's scary  i just don't know anything  about them  i mean  are they really cult-like  or is that just a bad rap  they get  they're powerful in hollywood  they're powerful 
[02:49:00]  they are powerful in hollywood  but so is everyone  is powerful in hollywood  who's gonna avoid  you know  gay people are powerful in hollywood  jewish people are powerful  in hollywood  um  you know i mean  there's a lot of  scientologists  i mean  every group  when banded together  is powerful  it seems like they're no more  cult-like than any religion  they're just newer  so it's harder to take  maybe  yeah  maybe  yeah  i just don't know  i don't necessarily disagree with you  hey uh  i can't believe we had troy in here  we were talking about snooki  and we forgot to  almost forgot to mention  the guy who's attempting  i remember this drove jimmy nuts 
[02:49:30]  before the show  when you saw this story  this annoyed me  man attempts to set world record  uh fist pumping  for 17 straight hours  why doesn't the guinness book world records  just tell this guy to go fuck himself  so what's this about  he's gonna just fist pump  for 17 hours  because he said he used to do  uh lightning fixtures  so he's having his hands above his head  right  fuck  you think this is a me me me guy  how long can you do it do you think 
[02:50:00]  i just did as long as i can do it  yeah i don't think i could  eight seconds  i don't think i could do more than a minute  i'm going  i'm going for it  right now  that's not a fist pump  that's not a fist pump  you know what  how about tomorrow  you fist pump the entire show  okay i'll do it  mr cocky  i'm gonna get the record  he's from ohio  oh that's why he's bored  uh  did he set it  34 year old unemployed man from ohio  attempted to set a guinness world record  over the weekend  by fist pumping for 17 straight hours  so they didn't even care enough 
[02:50:30]  to follow up on the guy  no  i hope that his fucking  oh he's almost there  and his arm went into an electrical socket  over his head  electrocuted him  but do you understand  they wrote this after the fact  and said he attempted  they don't even tell you  if he made it or not  james peterson began the attempt  on friday morning  and was scheduled to end  at 3 a.m  peterson  look they  they don't  they don't follow up the story  they know it's  it's over  but they don't even give you  the  the fact if he  uh  did it or not  they knew nobody was gonna 
[02:51:00]  actually read the article  it was not  i did this on st patrick's day  but it was not documented  peterson said  telling the paper that  he super glued  super glued his right fist closed  to ensure i maintain  perfect fist formation  so he's cheating  on the  why didn't he spend his time  doing something  huh  why didn't this guy  spend his time  doing something  why would you put  this much effort  into 17 hours  of fist pumping  because he wants  to set the record  he could do something  though  he is doing something  this is not something  he's fist pumping  right  or he wakes up 
[02:51:30]  with a blood clot  what  you have a good  weekend rolling  yeah  didn't do much  just saw movies  what movies  just chick flicks  on tv  why chick flicks  what chick flick  i just saw  bridesmaids  again  a lot of people  are starting to watch  that movie a lot  it's good  i've seen it once  did you like it  i enjoyed it  i would  could care less  if i ever see it  again  but it was decent  just decent 
[02:52:00]  yeah funny  yeah  most comedies  don't make me laugh  there were some  funny movies in that  funny moments in that  but  did you turn the corner  on bridesmaids  because at first  you didn't like it  yeah  he likes it  i liked it  yeah  yeah  i liked the fat broad  she's really funny  from mic and mom  yeah she was very good  she was really funny  and then  maya rudolph  whatever her name is  yeah  i don't think she's that funny  did you hear they're  moving community  to fridays 
[02:52:30]  kristin wig is funny  she was great  yes  kristin wig's funny  i don't think  maya  whatever her fucking name is  maya rudolph  i don't think she's that funny  why are they moving  i don't even know what she does  that is funny  isn't that bad for community  yeah of course  it's horrible  because they put up all night  with um  will arnett  and christian apple gate  on their time slot  what  up all night  up all night  oh that's the uh  they're pregnant with a kid  or  30 rock  no they just had a kid  or something  would they move them  out of the after  fucking 30  no they weren't on 
[02:53:00]  after 30 rock  they were on  before 30 rock  they don't care  they may be  basically that meant  they couldn't find a show  to replace it  so they're keeping it  until they find something else  community's done  for them to bring it back  but bring it  are they doing another season  just next season  that's it  only 13 episodes  yeah but to bring it back  and put it on friday night  friday's at 8 30  they're putting it there  to kill it  yeah of course  yeah i don't know  that means they just  didn't have another show  they could uh  put on their line  we for us  the weekends  might be different  than a lot of people  at home watching  tv on friday  friday nights  are is a dead zone 
[02:53:30]  for tv  i know that  now that i have  a fucking kid  i try to find  something on friday  there's nothing  to watch  they know that  it's young people  that watch community  and they're out  high school  and college age  people  and none of them  are watching tv  especially on friday  they're fist pumping  yes  what other shows  they cancel  they cancel glee  no  that's massive  that's massive  oh  whitney is also  moving to friday  oh boy  is she really  whitney is on  at 8 on friday  and then  community at 8 30  i was sad to see  i rob go 
[02:54:00]  it's rob  it's not i rob  no it's i rob  because they go  with the whole  iphone thing  they might not be  they're not killing  whitney  um  they're killing  whitney  yeah they may be  that friday slot  you don't  you don't  you don't put your  show on friday  night if you really  like it  but musty tv  doesn't exist anymore  what  musty tv  doesn't exist  no i understand  that but friday  doesn't help it  friday is the worst  friday is the worst  even in this new  world we live in  what are they putting  in whitney spot  a new show right  whitney was on  on tuesday  i think it's that  new matthew perry show 
[02:54:30]  right  which one is that  yeah he's a sportscaster  oh  that should be good  it does look pretty good  though  no it doesn't  it doesn't  none of these shows  look good  they're all the same  same fucking shows  have you seen as more  comedies this year  same canned laughter  same fucking giant sets  yeah  why didn't i rob work  did you watch it  yeah i did  yeah you probably  i hear his wife  very bad  i hear he's married  to like a six foot  tall like zumba  or rumba dance  whatever it's called  that and i've heard  she is a fucking 
[02:55:00]  a beautiful woman  i heard his wife  is amazingly hot  let's look at his  wife  please  zumba dancer i think  or instructor  whatever that is  rumba  rumba maybe  i don't know  rumba rumba  rumba  rumba  i used to do it  but i hurt my leg  oh the rob schneider show  ew  yeah i heard rob's wife  is gorgeous  his brother looks like him  oh yeah she has a great body  she's  yeah she's  she's alright  oh she's  oh wow  okay  yeah she's nice  wow  rob schneider has a brother  that looks like him 
[02:55:30]  yeah  what does he do for a living  i think he's like his manager  or something like that  really  wherever he goes  he's with him  alright  well  it's good that he's got a hot girl  it's good that a show guy  cancelled  i never saw it  that was horrendous  it was very bad  cheech was good in it though  cheech marin is good in anything  that's his life though  he's married to a mexican woman  and i think he's just trying to  oh  so he brought a little real life to tv  i think so  sure  alright  and that didn't work either  spanish  is that  like everyone has raymond  but like in spanish  i would  i would say rob schneider is 
[02:56:00]  one of the most overrated  fucking guys in all of hollywood  i don't know anything he's ever done  i don't think i've ever seen  rob schneider in a movie  every samler movie  yeah think adam sandler  i never saw his sandler movies  dude's big ol' male jiggle  it was a big hit  never saw it  um  what was the one where  he dressed like a chick  the hot chick  holy fuck  i actually started watching that one day  i can't believe someone said  yeah this  we need to put this out there  i enjoy that movie  you do  i  yep  why  i don't know  i was so uncomfortable  watching that  not in a good way

[02:59:30]  in the x-files  yeah  in 98  she fucking  i look i'm sure she's got  a better career than i do  but  she's had parts and everything  but no one  talks about her  i'm so happy  as a comedian  you just can't boycott  stuff like that  especially since  you can't boycott  other comedians  what are you talking about  i would love to know  a list of fucking bands  that this phony was on with  and i would love to know  how their personal lives were  and i would love to know  what other performers  personal  you know like
