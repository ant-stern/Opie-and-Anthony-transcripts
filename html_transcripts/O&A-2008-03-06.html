<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with boasts about their superior ratings, celebrating their triumph over WMMS and the Maxwell show.  They then covered a small explosion near a Times Square military recruiting center, initially hyped by news channels but dismissed by the hosts as likely a minor incident, perhaps involving a small explosive device.  The hosts mocked news reporters, particularly one they called "Smug Guy," playing clips of their overly dramatic coverage.  The impending *The Wire* finale and rumors of a *Sopranos* movie were discussed, alongside listener calls.  One caller, Chris from a Garden City Marine recruiting center, speculated a connection between the explosion and anti-war protests, while another, Scott from the FDNY, identified the device as a small pipe bomb.  A segment replayed clips from a disastrous car giveaway, featuring a malfunctioning vehicle.  Regular caller "Cigars and Scotch" also called in, contributing to a running list of bizarre Manhattan events.  The show included a humorous, off-key rendition of "Time of My Life" for Patrick Swayze, and a clip of a news report with a reporter's amusing mispronunciation of "asphalt" as "ass blank."  A listener’s encounter with aggressive mosquitoes in Mastic, Long Island, concluded this portion.

A furious phone call from a female lawyer in Mastic, Long Island, protesting the show's mockery of her town, dominated the next segment.  The hosts defended their humor and tried to find her online information; station employee Jiven had initially taken her call.  Anthony Cumia's recent singlehood was a major topic, with humorous descriptions of his solitary life and a bit about getting him a new cat, repeatedly using the term "pussy."  The show revisited the disastrous car giveaway, playing audio from a news report and recounting their experiences, including the program director's involvement and consequences.  A call about the River Rave music festival in Boston followed, alongside a discussion of the recurring character Spuds Buckley, with old audio clips played.  The upcoming appearances of Geraldo Rivera and *The Wire* actors were mentioned.  Hosts made several humorous, often offensive, comments, including references to assless chaps and a "Made in Vagina" t-shirt.

Geraldo Rivera appeared as a guest, criticizing Bill O'Reilly's scapegoating of illegal immigrants, particularly regarding a drunk driving incident.  Geraldo argued against O'Reilly's inflammatory rhetoric and stereotypes, discussing his book on American fears of Hispanics and defending the Hispanic community against negative portrayals. He addressed assimilation, legal immigration, and the prevalence of Spanish speakers, engaging in a heated debate with a host about the extent of non-English speaking Hispanics and reasons for anti-immigrant sentiment.  Later, Isaiah Whitlock Jr. (*The Wire*'s Clay Davis) joined, discussing his character and the show's portrayal of Baltimore's drug trade and politics. They discussed plot points and characters like Omar, Stringer Bell, and Marlo Stanfield, briefly touching on the show's Emmy snubs.  A clip of Whitlock's character's dialogue was played, and the segment concluded with promotional announcements for comedians' shows.

More *The Wire* actors joined, beginning with a discussion about Emmy Awards and perceived injustices. Isaiah Whitlock Jr. shared *Goodfellas* set experiences, including a story about Martin Scorsese and a confrontational casting director.  Other guests, including "Bengu," shared their acting backgrounds, with Bengu detailing how his father's death influenced his career change.  They recounted *The Wire* roles and experiences, including humorous stories and a detailed description of a violent scene.  Discussions included interactions with Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and the show's realism.  "Flea," a listener concerned about a recent animation contest favoring professional studios over individual entrants, sparked a heated debate. Flea defended individual entrants, while the hosts and a representative from the winning studio defended their participation.  This led to a discussion about the contest's fairness and the announcement of an Opie and Anthony Animation Festival.  Several off-color jokes and comments were made, and a microphone feedback issue occurred.

A discussion about the radio station animation contest followed, featuring Andrea, creator of the second-place puppet animation "New Names." Andrea expressed frustration over the delayed winner announcement and losing to a professional company.  Her animation referenced Opie's fiancé giving him smelly sweatpants.  The hosts revealed Andrea received help from "Great American Zero," leading to a debate about disqualification.  Despite initial disqualification, Andrea was included in the upcoming animation festival.  The hosts discussed Flea, known for a drunk video threatening legal action.  They also discussed a hair-growing contest between Eastside Dave and Danny, and an upcoming segment titled "What's Up Eastside Dave's Butt?"  Geraldo Rivera's interview was revisited, focusing on Jimmy's strong opinions challenging Geraldo's views on immigration.  Numerous old audio clips were played, including a profane Darth Volker Star Wars parody, a crude commute recording, the "Scared Shitless Project" (a recording from Harlem containing overtly racist language), the "Schlong Song," and a Blair Witch Project parody.  The hosts discussed old bits like the "Spuds Buckley" character and the success of previous animations ("Vista" and "Darth Volker").  Listener calls and comments were interspersed.  Jimmy's upcoming Comedy Central appearance was mentioned.

The final segment started with confusion about an autograph request for Benga.  The hosts abruptly ended the show, repeatedly saying "bye" and wishing listener Jimmy well.  A listener's sports team victory was mentioned.  They promoted an upcoming event at FH Riley's bar in Huntington, highlighting the St. Patrick's Day parade, discussing the bar's atmosphere and humorous complaints about bagpipers.  The show concluded with a nonsensical closing announcement repeating "We'll be right back," including the phrase "בש Monument" and other unintelligible sounds.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  There was some dude who liked horses and liked the radio show and named his horses after us.  And then let them starve.  And then let them starve.  Great.  Kind of like what we're doing to the listeners.  Starving them of entertainment.  They are sick.  Freeze!  Bobby, please, there's one part we want you to see.  That's easy. 
[00:01:00]  Oh, you okay?  Where entertainment is going?  These guys are watching porn.  Oh, Jesus.  What are we talking about?  We're going down.  What is this?  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, that one's got to hurt in the end.  Ow. 
[00:01:30]  I want to say good morning to Cleveland.  Hi, Cleveland.  We'll say this a few times today, but I guess the ratings or some type of ratings came out yesterday morning.  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony show and tape delay at Afternoon Drive.  Yeah.  Kick the S out of WMMS and the Maxwell show.  And Maxwell.  Nat Verney.  So he's got to live with that.  The last ratings for us in Afternoon Drive.  Yeah.  We beat his ass. 
[00:02:00]  Good morning, Cleveland.  And now we're live in the morning to do some more ass kicking.  So the pest could ask him about that today because you're pretty much controlling his radio show in afternoons.  Yeah.  I'm sure he's really loving that.  The pests are on him.  You can't lie about something that's written down.  No.  And official.  It's the way it is.  Deal with it.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Got a very busy show here.  We got basil teas in the corner making breakfast for E-Rock's birthday, which was about three or four days ago. 
[00:02:30]  But it's smelling really good over there.  I'm looking forward to an egg white omelet, sir.  I hope you brought plenty of bacon for E-Rock.  There's a lot of bacon there.  And Club Serta Kenny picks me up and gives me the big news that there's a huge explosion in New York City.  Did you hear?  That's all they're talking about on 1010 Wins.  So then we listen to 1010 Wins, and they're talking about the weather, and the Knicks, and spring training, and stocks, and how coffee prices went way, way up. 
[00:03:00]  I heard that one on my way in.  And back to the Knicks because LeBron James scored 50 points, and a fan ran out onto the court.  And I'm like, I thought you said that's all they're talking about.  That's all they should be talking about.  You know, they have to go back into that cycle thing, that new cycle thing. 
[00:03:30]  And then we finally got some kind of news that there was an explosion in Times Square.  Yeah, at the recruiting center.  They got that recruiting center right down there in Times Square.  It was always a little odd.  It's just there, like, with all the lights and everything.  What's the purpose of that?  If you're just walking around Times Square and decide, ah, I want to be a Marine.  I think they get a lot of people signing up after, you know, the big ball drop.  You think that's it?  They're just staggering around, hammered. 
[00:04:00]  Like, I don't know what they're expecting.  Tourists aren't going to like, you know, I'm here to visit New York City, but, eh.  Yeah.  Let me join the Army.  Yeah, well, you're right, I guess.  I don't know.  It's just an odd place, I think, for a recruiting center.  But it's been there for a long time, and apparently somebody put some kind of explosive device in front of it, and it blew up.  No one's saying how big it is, but the news loves sensationalizing it.  They love using the word explosion.  Yeah.  And technically, they're right. 
[00:04:30]  It's some kind of explosion, but they love to make it sound bigger than it is.  But they said people felt it.  They felt this explosion, that buildings moved a little bit, and they felt it in their trucks as they were doing their morning deliveries.  If it's 3.15 or 3.45 in the morning, whenever this thing went off, an M-80 would probably do the same thing.  It's just deathly quiet, nothing's going on, and then all of a sudden, bang.  You've got canyons of buildings for things to echo off of and bounce off of, so, yeah, you're going to hear it. 
[00:05:00]  Most people, they have no clue, because they see Times Square just packed all the time.  Yeah.  But in the middle of the night, if you're coming home from a bar late and you're walking through that area, you could pretty much hear a pin drop.  There's, like, no one around.  Desolate.  No one lives there, and all the businesses are shut down, so there's really no reason to walk around there.  Back in the day, the reason was to cop, drugs, get a hooker.  Prostitute.  Go see a dirty movie. 
[00:05:30]  Go to the peep show.  It's a sandy cane.  Yeah, you had to wear your trench coat for that, but, so, I don't know, I mean, we're still trying to get some info, but the news, they're already moving on to other stories.  Remember the, we had a story recently in New York, I don't know, a few months back, maybe even a year, about that bomb that went off in the planter.  Yeah.  It was a tree planter in front of some news building, I think it was.  That was on the east side.  Wasn't that near some of the, like, the foreign buildings there, the, what are they called, the embassies? 
[00:06:00]  The embassies and all that.  Yeah, and at first, this big thing, when they first get details, they love saying, you know, big explosion in Manhattan.  And you're like, what, what, what, what, what, and then you realize it was like a, it was a pipe bomb, but, you know, I used to make those when I was a kid, pipe bombs.  They're like recreation for kids.  You just kind of find a pipe, fill it up with some, a broken open M80s or something, put some, put some Teflon tape on the end, screw a cap on, a little fuse, and then you take a cigarette and put it on the fuse. 
[00:06:30]  And leave it in a big fence post and, and just watch the fence just fly up in the air like a movie.  And you're sitting there as a kid going, wow, that worked.  That was cool.  Yeah.  So, uh, I don't, I don't know if it's anything more than that.  I don't think a terrorist is going to be setting off a bomb when there's no one around.  Yeah. 
[00:07:00]  I am a terrorist, but, uh, I don't want to hurt anybody.  So that's, uh, that's where we're at now in the, with the Times Square story.  I'm sure they'll, they'll, uh, give us details and it'll amount to nothing.  Or we're kind of used to this stuff here in New York City.  Yeah.  We really are.  Things blowing up.  Steam pipes blowing up.  Dennis Leary does an old bit where he talks about how great it is to live in New York City because every day it's something crazy.  Yeah.  We should start keeping track because this week alone we got a little explosion in Times Square that we're trying to figure out more info on. 
[00:07:30]  And we had a building just, the whole facade of the building just fell over.  Yeah.  The front of buildings will just fall off.  If you're in New York City, ah, in front of a building just falls off.  We've got to keep track of all the stuff that happens on a weekly basis because we do take it for granted.  It could be our new bit.  Maybe, uh, the listeners can help us out.  In one week period, what happens in Manhattan?  Yeah.  Because, like, I'm from Long Island, like Anthony, I'm from Huntington.  You don't have an explosion and a building falling down all in the same week.  I know it's a small town, but I think you know what I'm getting at. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  You know, most people go about their daily lives and they don't see half the stuff we see in a week here in Manhattan.  And, and anywhere else the story would last weeks.  Yeah, yeah.  And here it's like news for one day.  Yeah.  And it just goes away.  Oh, yeah.  The front of a building fell off.  Yeah, that was yesterday's news.  Yeah.  Today, a little explosion happened.  And we read these stories every morning like, oh, yeah, okay, whatever.  But if we kept track, it would be pretty impressive, I'm starting to think. 
[00:08:30]  Like, we're up to what?  Thursday now?  Yep.  Maybe the listeners in the New York area could help us out.  What has happened since Monday?  Uh, let's even say since Sunday.  Sunday night all the way to now.  To now.  In New York City.  What kind of, uh, hijinks and shenanigans are taking place out there?  Yeah, let's get our list together.  We got, uh, the, the whole front of a building falling down.  Yep.  We got this, uh, explosion in Times Square.  What else has happened?  Hmm.  We'll make that list today.  Also, I hear there's a lawyer, uh, changing gears.  We, we got a very busy show, so we got to cover a lot of stuff. 
[00:09:00]  Yes, we do.  Because we got Geraldo coming in today.  Uh, Geraldo Rivera, of course.  And a bunch of guys from The Wire.  Uh, my, uh, favorite show on DVD.  Yes.  Because he's way, way behind.  And Jimmy's favorite show on HBO.  He's, uh, right up to date.  Big, uh, uh, series.  Series finale.  Series.  I want to keep saying season, but yeah, series finale this Sunday on HBO.  I'm kind of glad at this point that I haven't been watching it.  Because I'm not familiar with any of the characters.  So, all the spoilers that you guys have told me, I, I won't know who these people are.  And I'll forget by the time I start watching it. 
[00:09:30]  Too many names.  Uh, which is good.  I, I truly sacrifice for you, the listener.  The listener.  Because I love this wire.  I got, uh, the box set.  I got seasons, uh, one through four.  And then when I'm done with that, I'll, I'll get season five somehow.  Yeah.  And, uh, and I, I was doing a pretty good job avoiding all spoilers until the dumb paper  had Omar gets killed, which is a huge spoiler.  Yeah.  Um, and then yesterday, I just got destroyed. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, you really did.  Destroyed, man.  At least four or five during the interview with the guys yesterday.  Yeah.  With Bubz and, uh, the other dude.  Yeah, Tristan just started.  Tristan.  And then I thought I was safe in the stall in between radio shows yesterday.  And Master Poe comes in and starts talking about the show and gives up another spoiler.  As Jimmy's in there taking a leak, he has to come in and go, oh, that wire, I love it.  And I'm in a stall trying to be.  Just yell, shut up.  That's what I did to Jimmy.  I'm like, oh my God, I'm not even safe in the stall. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, Poe just poked his head in.  Oh, just brutal.  He's a spoiler.  But you know what?  The show is so damn good in the character developing, uh, development and the, and the writing  that I, I truly don't even care.  I really don't care.  Cause some of the things I knew about, you know, have now happened and I'm like, all  right, it still was cool for me.  It was, it still made the show cool.  So, uh, oh, oh, you had some cause I was going somewhere with this.  Were you going with the, uh, uh, Sopranos?  No, go ahead.  Do you hear that?  Uh, rumor has it a movie. 
[00:11:00]  Of course.  Yeah.  Rumor has it.  Why not?  There's way too much money to be made.  I think somebody, um, tipped off the owner of, uh, the, what's it called?  The Settin' Doll or something?  The place that they made Bada Bing?  Uh-huh.  And, uh, yeah.  Kind of tipped him off that, uh, they're making a movie and perhaps he shouldn't, uh,  do this renovation that he was going to be doing in the place.  He was going to totally redo the place over again.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So now he's just leaving it the same. 
[00:11:30]  So if they want to film in there, uh, they can do it.  Right.  Uh, but yeah, rumor has it.  Oh, that's pretty cool.  That they could be making a movie.  It's cool, but it's not.  Because now what you're going to get is a lot of these really, you know, cool, um, cable  series just expecting a movie at the end.  Right.  So they're not going to wrap up stuff.  Yeah, they won't wrap anything up.  They'll just leave it wide open and you'll have to go to the movie.  To see the end of this fine series that you've been watching for, you know, many, many years.  It's all about the money. 
[00:12:00]  Christopher's dead.  Um, uh, Bobby Bacala's dead.  I mean, uh, what's it going to be?  Gandolfini and Pauly going for a ride.  You know what I would do?  I would just make the Sopranos and make believe all that stuff didn't happen and just pretty  much start over.  Start over.  You know and love the characters and just totally, totally throw.  Beginning to end.  Just throw a curveball.  Like, all right, this is the movie version of Sopranos.  You know, the characters are completely the same, but now you thought you knew what was  going on.  Oh no, we start over.  Brand new story. 
[00:12:30]  I think that would be, how cool would that be though?  It would be cool if in the opening scene, uh, Melfi just gets her head blown off sitting  in her office.  Right.  Doesn't get to say a word.  The door opens.  She opens her mouth to say something and her head explodes.  I think that's what wrecked the Sopranos for me.  I just couldn't take the, the sitting down as a therapist crap anymore.  Well, she was terrible.  Yeah.  I just couldn't take it.  She was terrible.  Oh no.  Why do you feel this way?  Now, Anthony, you have to shut up. 
[00:13:00]  It was okay here and there, but man, it took up way too much time.  Why are we talking about Sopranos?  I know.  It's two years ago.  I know.  Two years ago.  Well, movie rumor.  You love your mother?  Yeah.  You hate her.  Uh, you know what?  It's, it's, it's still relevant.  I think a lot of people can relate to how awful that is.  So Times Square Explosion.  Uh, this is all we know so far.  Uh, here's the, well, we're getting our info from Channel 11.  Whoa.  Hey.  Oh boy.  You know, they're on top of things, right, Jimmy?  Of course.  Whoa.  Hey.  Which we dub as, you know, we know some of the people down there and everything, 
[00:13:30]  and it's no insult to them personally, but we kind of dub the CW 11.  It's here in New York.  Their newscast in the morning.  Probably the worst newscast ever.  Yeah.  But we can't stop watching it because of that.  They, they, their cues are all off.  Their, their, their cameras are usually in the wrong spot.  Yeah.  They're stammering reporters.  Yeah.  They, they, they really don't get any information out.  No.  The updates aren't updates at all.  Little known fact, I, um, I, uh, did a little, uh, a little news. 
[00:14:00]  Well.  For Geneseo TV back in the day.  Whoa.  And I think our fine, I think our fine news is,  the news team for, for college TV did a better job.  Did a better job.  So you want to hear the, uh, the explosion?  Uh, yeah.  Not the actual explosion, but how they're reporting it?  Yeah.  Okay.  Here you go.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Oh, no, no.  Good morning, Bearman.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[00:14:30]  That's something else.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  That's something else.  Oh, my God.  Anyway, let's, um.  That, no, no, no.  What?  What are you talking about?  No.  No, that wasn't what I thought it was.  All right.  So.  Is that what I thought it was?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it was.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, it was.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh.  What are you talking about?  I got the news story of the Times Square explosion.  No, I know what that was.  You used to do some news reports?  That was.  No, I got the, you know, there's an explosion in Times Square. 
[00:15:00]  Let me hear that clip again.  What clip?  The clip you just played of the explosion.  No, what are you talking about?  The clip you just played.  Of the explosion?  La, la, la, la, la.  Hello, Bearman.  Yeah, I'll be very interested in hearing that as well.  Oh, so we got a, we got a Times Square explosion story here.  Well, let's just show you what we've got right here.  We are at 41st Street and Broadway, and you can see right here to your left, we have police 
[00:15:30]  here at 41st.  The whole Times Square area is frozen.  It's shut down.  They are turning people away.  The reason for that is, that is the Armed Forces recruiting station.  We've talked with a number of eyewitnesses.  They tell us that the front of that building is blown out.  The glass that is on the front of that building, blown out by an explosion.  The front of the building being blown out is different than the windows being broken. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  I'm sorry, it just is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all we got so far on that.  Yeah, that's, that's it?  Well, yeah, that is it.  Where's the, yeah.  No, that is it.  Is it?  Yeah, that's all you get.  I'd love to hear more.  Believe me, I would love to hear more.  All right.  Let's take a look at some video we shot here in Times Square about that.  What?  Wrong clip.  You put the wrong thing.  Yeah.  No, no.  You guys said you wanted to hear more, so I'm playing more.  It's the Times Square explosion story. 
[00:16:30]  This is a big, big story today in New York City.  I'd rather hear of an explosion or a career blowing up than a Times Square explosion.  Something about Bear Man?  Yeah, I heard something.  What are you talking about?  This is big.  We got to get into this a little bit.  Times Square explosion.  Let's take a look at some video we shot here in Times Square about an hour ago.  Around 3.50 a.m., an explosion that witnesses described as a thunderclap or a manhole explosion  went off in front of the recruiting station. 
[00:17:00]  A manhole explosion.  Yeah, look out.  You got to watch those manhole explosions.  A manhole explosion went off in front of the recruiting station at Times Square.  Eyewitnesses tell me they saw a column of smoke ten stories high after this loud sonic boom went off.  Sonic boom?  Hold on.  What the hell is he talking about?  What network is this?  It's stupid, you know, Channel 11. 
[00:17:30]  Stupid Channel 11.  First of all, a sonic boom?  What did he tell you?  What a plane fly over?  It's not a sonic boom.  And a plume of smoke ten stories high isn't that high.  Yeah.  It really isn't.  A ten story building and smoke coming.  I used to do that with my barbecue.  You could get your cigarette smoke up.  Yeah.  Up ten stories, man.  Yes.  Yes.  You could.  Ten stories high.  Well, let's... 
[00:18:00]  A matter of inches.  Let's keep it real here.  I'm going to say some underground explosion, some kind of pipe explosion, something.  Because it's Times Square.  That place is lit up with cameras, man.  It's a broken window.  Can they get...  Oh, my God.  That's it.  Their window's broken.  They got a little close-up of it now.  Dude, there's your front page on the paper, Mauro.  It says, I want you.  It's a broken window.  It's the poster of Uncle Sam.  It says, I want you.  And then the window in front of that poster is broken.  Is broken. 
[00:18:30]  And that's the front of the building has been blown out.  Yeah.  It's a broken window.  Just sensationalized everything.  We really don't know what this is all about, but I'm guessing that it's some kind of just  accident because Times Square has cameras, like, everywhere.  Everywhere.  And they're constantly on.  You could go online and punch up a camera for Times Square right now.  Right.  And it's on all the time.  So I'm sure they'll have video.  And we don't even have to wait for the NYPD.  Someone out there, if there was some suspicious character setting off a bomb, there's got to 
[00:19:00]  be footage already on the internet.  I think it was somebody doing a little hijinks.  You think?  Yeah.  A little pipe bomb, maybe?  Yeah, a little pipe bomb action.  Drop the pipe bomb and keep walking.  Something like that.  You keep walking.  Yeah.  You let it blow up.  You giggle.  Yeah.  And you run away.  After this loud sonic boom went off, a boom so loud, it shook some of the buildings  nearby and definitely rocked trucks and cars.  They were right nearby.  That's how significant this explosion was. 
[00:19:30]  It rocked cars and trucks?  It rocked.  It didn't rock trucks and cars.  They might have felt a little shaky shake if they were close.  We're getting reports now coming in that a paper bag full of dog duty was left in flames  on a patio.  Somebody came out and stomped on it and may have got dog feces on their foot.  We'll be back with this breaking story.  People have been ringing people's doorbells and running away. 
[00:20:00]  The ring of the bell could be heard throughout the house.  It's probably a stupid prank.  Yeah.  It looked like one broken window is what they showed.  That's all we see.  They zoomed right in on it, too.  So, you know, if there was any more damage, they'd have pulled out to show all the damage.  Right.  So they just focused in on that little bit of damage.  My favorite clip.  We got the report.  I'll tell you what my favorite clip is. 
[00:20:30]  What?  The one I heard about five minutes ago.  Mine, too.  What?  I want to hear more of that.  What are you talking about?  I don't know, to tell you the truth.  What are you talking about?  The report talks about his own experience out there.  Oh, the reporter.  Yes.  Yes, of course.  Let me tear down a wall for everybody.  You really think it's just going to be that easy?  Of course not.  You're going to have to invest some time in listening to this show today, tomorrow. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, but I want to hear it.  Maybe as far as Monday or Tuesday.  You don't think I just started doing this radio thing, do you?  The chatter has begun.  But anyway, the reporter talks about his own experience out there.  Yeah.  And listen to what his experience is all about.  Yeah, listen to this, because it's ridiculous.  I'll even stop it, so we can guess what it is.  I'll stop it in a second here.  I can also tell you, just from our experience out here. 
[00:21:30]  All right, I can tell you from our experience out here.  He's the reporter doing the stand-up, live from Times Square.  He's very far away from the site.  Yeah, he's a seasoned street reporter.  And he's basically saying, I can tell you from our experience out here.  He's been out doing the news for so long, he's seen it all.  Right.  So from his experience, you should really listen.  Sure.  Because I'm sure he's just a bevy of knowledge. 
[00:22:00]  You ready?  I'm ready.  I can also tell you, just from our experience out here, police are taking this extremely seriously.  We had been just paces away.  So, some type of bomb goes off in Times Square.  Right.  And he's got to tell us, because he's experienced enough to let us know.  Yeah.  Because we wouldn't have figured this out.  That the police are taking it seriously.  No, extremely seriously.  Extremely seriously. 
[00:22:30]  Seriously.  That's what we get from this seasoned street reporter.  Thank you.  There's levels of seriousness.  And in this one, it is called for extreme measures.  Yeah.  Right.  Extreme.  But we would never have known that if it weren't for his experience.  We would have thought, well, if a bomb goes off at the crossroads of the world, maybe the police are going to go, ah, ah, kind of busy.  Extremely seriously.  We had been just paces away from the armed forces recruiting station. 
[00:23:00]  They then moved us, moved our live truck a half block away.  Because you're a pain in the ass.  Because your pain's in the ass is why they moved us.  Didn't he say we were paces away?  Yeah.  Well, you still are, just more.  He said they moved them a half block.  Like, that's not that big a crash radius.  No.  And I'll tell you why.  Because the NYPD doesn't want to deal with you clowns. 
[00:23:30]  That's what it is.  They're tired.  They don't want to, you're yelling questions at them.  There's three things the NYPD don't want to deal with.  Oh, cool.  It would be rats, cockroaches, and dopey local TV news crews.  And they all fit in the same category.  Oh, and also.  Vermin.  And also, if you could use the bleep there.  And also.  Oh, oh, oh, yes.  And also.  Yes.  They then moved us, moved our lives. 
[00:24:00]  That was one for the NYPD.  Of course.  I'm sure they're laughing in their control room right now.  Hello, boys.  They then moved us, moved our live truck a half block away.  Wow.  Then forced us to move two blocks away.  Whoa.  Which is where we are right now.  And by seven o'clock, I think we're going to be three blocks away.  I'm reporting from Staten Island.  Right.  They're just screwing with Smug Guy is what they're doing.  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  Mwah.  Mwah.  Mwah.  Mwah.  Mwah.  Mwah.  Mwah.  Mwah.  Mwah.  Mwah.  Mwah.  That was Smug Guy?  That was Smug Guy.  Yeah.  We love Smug Guy.  One of our favorite reporters on Channel 11, Smug Guy.  We haven't been able to do this guy justice on the radio, but every reporter is like,  Mwah.  You see?  Mwah.  Mwah.  He makes an Edward G. Robinson mouth when he reports.  He goes, Mwah.  Yeah.  Well, I got to tell you, in my experience, and he tries to come off as a seasoned newsman.  Back to you in the studio.  And he stops and freezes and makes his face that just looks like, Mwah. 
[00:25:00]  Sammy Davis lip.  Yes.  Sammy Davis Jr. lip.  Yes.  And they'll just take it as a news crew.  I'm sure by nine o'clock, we're now reporting from East Hampton.  Yes.  They keep pushing us.  We're on a boat in the international waters.  Right.  They're just screwing with him.  This is where we are right now.  From this aerial picture, you can see not a car in sight.  There was someone taken into custody.  That person had been sniffed by bomb-sniffing dogs and then taken away. 
[00:25:30]  We have pictures of that person.  We'll be showing more later in the broadcast.  A lot of action here on this developing story.  That guy has nothing to do with the blast, you dummy.  Why don't you say it?  He probably happened to be in the area when this thing went off.  Like, oh, damn.  He's got a little dust on him.  Yeah.  He just wants to go home from a night of drinking.  And now he's in police custody.  Oh, damn.  I got gunpowder on me.  All right.  So, when we get back.  Yeah.  When we get back. 
[00:26:00]  Yes.  We got more audio.  Yeah.  We got.  He probably had pot on him.  Is that it?  Huh?  Poor guy probably just had pot on him walking through Times Square.  What, man?  We got more audio after the break.  Yeah.  Yeah, I can't wait to hear this audio.  Um...  Hmm.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Oh, wait.  That's not it.  We got more audio after the break.  Oh.  We got...  I don't know if I can listen to that.  Listen to what? 
[00:26:30]  What I just heard.  What?  My jaw and stomach hurts.  I know.  Yeah.  It's physical pain to listen to that.  Oh, but I'm so glad.  Why did I have to unpack boxes?  Oh, reports are coming in.  Yes.  Hey, when we come back, we go to the street and talk to the peeps.  Channel 11, they talk to the people on the street about the explosion. 
[00:27:00]  Well...  This is one of Jimmy's favorite bits where they have to get the local angle, they have  to get the man on the street a view or angle on the big story.  No story.  No story's complete until you talk to the people out there on the streets.  Right.  And as you know...  You know nothing and add nothing.  And as you know, I've been finally unpacking boxes now that I've been living in a real place  for almost a year.  Like a big boy.  And I brought in some more audio today. 
[00:27:30]  Mm-hmm.  We've been talking about this bit for a long time.  Off and on, it comes up on the show.  Certainly does.  Remember the time you and I gave away a car that didn't start?  I thought you were talking about some other audio.  I got the news report of the car giveaway.  Oh, okay.  Listen to that.  When we were up in Boston, we had this huge promotion at the end of it.  We were giving away... 
[00:28:00]  What was it?  Like a Mustang?  It was a Mustang, yeah.  And I remember a mere week before the actual giveaway, we still didn't have the Mustang.  No.  And Dave Douglas took a chance and bought a Mustang, a vintage Mustang.  And then it came time for the listener, the winner, to start up the Mustang, and it didn't  start up...  And the news crews were there, and we just got fried by the local news in Boston.  Yeah, it was supposed to be one that was, what, refurbished? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Not refurbished, like restored.  Yes.  Yeah, a restored Mustang.  Yes.  And it was just put together with bubble gum.  Yes.  And repainted like it was still wet.  The paint was still wet on it.  Yeah.  And it was pulled up.  Yeah.  It's just horrible.  We have the news story after the break, because it's really funny.  A little...  Taking a look down memory lane.  Yes.  We're kind of doing this bit called Old School Opie and Anthony on our website.  We can't promote, unfortunately. 
[00:29:00]  There's a whole section of old school stuff, like old videos and old pictures and old radio  bits.  Yep.  It's a fine section, if you haven't checked out our website in a while.  Also, there's an animation section now up on the website we cannot promote that is named  after this show.  Exactly after this show.  And Opie spelled O-P-I-E, by the way.  Yes, please.  And you got to spell out and.  It's not Opie.  And then you got to do his name.  That's easy.  And then you got to do, of course, the dot com.  Right.  And you would get there.  But we're not really allowed to promote that. 
[00:29:30]  No.  So let's keep it at that, okay?  Phone number 877-212-018.  Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy Norton.  Hey, good morning, everyone.  Look, here's the deal.  There was an explosion in Times Square.  We don't know anything.  And when I mean we don't know anything, no one knows anything yet.  And as soon as we do, we'll pass it along to you.  Of course.  I'm saying it's some kind of smaller explosion, obviously. 
[00:30:00]  Because it looks like, to me, just watching the news, it looks like,  just the window was blown out.  Yeah.  It's at the window, the front window.  And the glass on the door wasn't even completely broken.  It was kind of shattered.  Right.  But it wasn't out of the door.  But this is perfect for the news.  They'll make this into the second coming of 9-11 and all that.  Yes.  You watch.  You watch.  I mean, it's obviously a serious thing.  Yeah.  But they're going to just go over the top of this one.  And as soon as we get the latest info.  Well, where were you on three sticks? 
[00:30:30]  Where were you?  Thank you, fam.  877-212-080.  Listen, we got basil tea.  Sorry.  Cooking omelets over there for E-Rock's birthday.  He doesn't really get much from cooking us breakfast every once in a while.  He gets recognized like, oh, you cooked breakfast for Opie and Anthony.  He's like, yeah, but my business is suffering because no one is actually coming by and having the food.  The food is very good.  The food is excellent. 
[00:31:00]  Oh, yeah.  Basil tea is what?  Tom's River, right?  Pooper Avenue in Tom's River.  I've been down there.  And then Jimmy and Kenny were going at it.  Not going at it.  That's not the proper way to say that.  But they were discussing, as they always do, an upcoming gig that Jimmy will have and arrangements.  Here's the words you're looking for.  Jimmy is dealing with a psychopath on the break.  Mike, I'm doing Atlanta this Saturday night, which is the Roxy Theater in Atlanta. 
[00:31:30]  There are tickets available.  Now, going down there tomorrow morning very early because I didn't know what kind of press I was going to have.  And I was supposed to go down actually Thursday afternoon.  I figured I'd do Friday morning radio.  But I'm shooting a Comedy Central thing tonight live at Gotham I'm hosting.  So I'm going down tomorrow morning.  We land at like 9 in the morning.  And the rooms are charging us for the extra day to hold them because there's a big convention in town.  So there's no rooms available.  Atlanta's all about the convention, bro.  Yeah.  It's annoying, but I get why they got to do it. 
[00:32:00]  If there's NASCAR, you know, whatever.  They have to.  We're getting in hours early.  So it's 200 bucks for the room for each one of us.  Whatever.  400 bucks.  You have to do it.  We're going to do it.  Got to eat it.  Sit in the airport.  Yeah.  So what were the words you used, Kenny, when we're getting in at 9 o'clock?  I'll just keep, I'll what?  No, I'll, I'll just, I don't want to waste.  What was the words you used?  I don't remember.  I'll do something.  I'll just keep busy.  I'll, I'll camp out.  Yeah, I'll camp out.  That was it.  I'll camp out.  I'll camp out and wait. 
[00:32:30]  And hope a room opens early.  Yeah.  We're getting in at 9.05.  Check it is 4 o'clock.  You're going to camp out.  That's why I don't mind paying the money.  I'm like, that's what, you can't ask the hotel to just not have a resident there the  night before.  Well, I tried to negotiate as a condition of the reservation and early checking, but there's  a big convention and there's NASCAR races all weekend after, you know, in Atlanta.  Well, I'll camp out.  You can use my hair as kindling.  No, I figured the plane lands at 9.  We'll get to the hotel by 10. 
[00:33:00]  I'll have breakfast.  Wait, so you got a room.  Right.  That's a cozy half hour.  So you got a room because.  He got a rest.  No, I understand that.  And you're just going to walk around.  I'm so irritated.  He said he's just going to camp out and lurk and annoy the hotel employees.  What are you going to do in the lobby?  Just stand there like Dracula?  He's just going to walk around.  People are going to be, there's a suspicious character here.  And every time people are coming down with a luggage cart looking for a camp, what room  were you in?  Yeah, because there's a chance I'll get a, you know, a room. 
[00:33:30]  And I don't, I don't, I don't.  While you're camping.  He's so, I, I, Kenny's conscientious slash chronically and lunatically cheap.  Like, I don't always throw money around it to be an idiot about it, but it's like, dude,  I'm not going to have you sitting for hours when it's, it's an expense that we normally  wouldn't have.  If it's one of those things and it's $200, I would rather have you in your room. 
[00:34:00]  I'm not going to sleep in my room knowing that you're walking around in your, in the  lobby.  Yeah, but no, I'll have breakfast.  I got that.  I know.  All right.  But you're going to be tired and you don't want to check in and you don't want to, and  here's what I'm going to hear.  Can I use your bathroom?  Oh God.  Can I use your bathroom?  So I want you to call them and get the, get the, the room straightened out.  I don't want you to do that.  Seriously.  Please.  I'll be fine.  Don't concern yourself.  I'm sure you will be.  He is the martyr.  I don't want to be a bother. 
[00:34:30]  I know.  But you're a bother because it's so annoying.  Yes.  I only care about him.  He doesn't get that part of it.  I don't want to be a bother.  And all you're doing is you're in a nice warm room picturing Kenny walking around out  in the cold.  Yeah.  That doesn't affect us.  It's just walking.  Just walking.  Trying to.  I'm camping out.  Hanging like a bass upside down in the lobby.  Just up in the rafters.  He's got his little legs wrapped around a piece of wood.  Like I'm taking my chances.  I'm gambling that maybe a room could be available versus wasting $200 of your money. 
[00:35:00]  Well, it's not a waste though.  It's a, it's a tax write off.  It's a legitimate business expense.  It's a room for the road.  It's not, it's not like I'm, I'm throwing around going, eh, treat yourself to the rolls.  I'm going to nap kid.  It's a room to sleep in.  But you're, you're always very generous and hospitable and you always take care of me nicely.  He treats me to elaborate dinners on the road.  I know that.  So what do you, how do you make up for it? 
[00:35:30]  You eat a piece of steak and a potato.  That's all you eat.  I know.  What's elaborate about that?  That's elaborate.  Elaborate is a little like a shrimp cocktail, a little caviar, a nice fine glass of wine.  He doesn't drink.  He doesn't eat vegetables.  He eats a piece of steak and a potato.  He's the worst.  He's just the worst.  So that's how you make up for it for a couple of dinners we have at Morton.  We have a couple of dinners on the road and now he wants to sleep under the piano in the lounge.  What's the matter with you?  We'll go to really nice restaurants and Kenny will make them like, cook them like a piece 
[00:36:00]  of grilled chicken, plain grilled chicken and like, not even rice, like a potato or something.  I mean, Jimmy are just like living large, enjoying ourselves, having a nice meal, fish  or something.  I got a spastic colon.  That's what your colon says about you.  I got a spastic human.  Oh, great.  Yeah.  I mean, a spastic human.  More importantly, come see Jimmy Saturday night at the Roxy Theater.  Right.  That'll be the highlight.  Maybe Kenny will be dozed off on the stage. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  No room for you at all, as a matter of fact.  I'll be selling merchandise, so bring monies.  Monies.  You know what?  I changed my mind.  No room.  Get ready.  You wasted $200 for Saturday, too.  You sleep at the venue.  All right.  Let's say hi to Scott from FDNY.  What's up, Scott?  Jesus.  What's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  Yeah, listen, I just wanted to tell you guys that, although you'll find out soon, this  thing in Times Square is not a big deal at all.  It was a pipe bomb outside of a shed, a recruitment shed, like a kiosk they have there. 
[00:37:00]  So it's not going to be your remember where you were today event.  I remember where I was when I first heard this.  Yeah.  It seems like just yet.  No, not yesterday.  It was today.  Unfortunately, I remember where I was, and that would be in Kenny's doll car.  The car of dolls.  Did you hear?  Did you hear?  It's everywhere.  I don't even know if we're going to be able to get close to the radio station. 
[00:37:30]  I hope we could get into work today, G.H.  We are about 13 blocks away.  Wait, you can't tell me you were in Kenny's truck.  Oh, boy, was I.  Hey, cancel your airfare.  Meet me in Atlanta.  And just start driving.  Yeah, start driving now.  I really want to start saving some money.  Good point, Ken.  Let's do it, too.  Speaking of the truck to be 50 cents a mile, it'll cost me $8 million to get him down there.  Speaking of possibly a pipe bomb explosion at Times Square, we're going to call it a pipe bomb explosion at this point. 
[00:38:00]  That's what we're calling it.  They talk to the people on the street in the area.  Thank God.  And this is one of Jimmy's favorite things, because these people, you hear them all the time, they add nothing to some horrific story that's going on.  Useless.  But the news insists on talking to the people in the area, and then these people give them nothing, or they give them the obvious.  Oh, it's just terrible.  Thank God somebody could have been hurt.  I guess it's good it went off in the middle of the night.  No one got hurt. 
[00:38:30]  I heard what I thought was an explosion, and it shook the windows.  I woke my wife up, and then they'll have their fat mouth come in there.  I heard something.  Oh, they add nothing.  Well, let's see what they add this time around.  I heard a loud bang, thought it was a manhole cover.  I mean, it was loud.  It shook my truck.  I walked down a corner, and there was a puff of smoke.  And that's when the first cop car was pulling up.  I walked around. 
[00:39:00]  The whole front of the recruiting station's all blown out.  The windows and the door and stuff.  The windows?  And then once they seen that, they moved everybody back.  And I just heard the boom, and then I saw the pile of smoke rising up.  Sounds like that guy hears a lot.  Absolutely.  Usually out of the back of his chaps, his S-less chaps, the smoke is rising up.  Yeah.  What a coincidence.  This is the second manhole explosion of the night.  The first one was the door at the bar.  He was shooting.  Smoke rising up, and that was it. 
[00:39:30]  Then I saw the police cars running.  It went really fast, but it was a really high pile of smoke.  From where I am, it's not like 10 stories.  A pile of smoke.  A pile of smoke.  You really can't pile up smoke.  No.  It kind of just sits there.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  A bushel of smoke.  Can I have two packages of smoke, please?  I saw a pod of smoke.  Measurement unit, sir.  Yeah.  Plume, not a pile.  Yeah. 
[00:40:00]  Pillar, maybe.  Pillar or plume.  Never a pile.  Never.  You can't have a pile of smoke.  You can't pile up smoke like that.  It dissipates.  It's just going to go away.  I saw a stack of smoke.  What happened to the pile of smoke?  I had it here an hour ago.  Steve from Bayshore.  I saw the smoke.  I thought days was giving the window UPS.  It's how it was.  Could be a crack hit.  Ling, ling.  I want the gold. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  We've got to take a break to catch up.  Here's what we do.  Patrick Swayze, front page of our paper.  We broke this news yesterday.  During the other portion of the show.  But basically, Patrick Swayze has pancreatic cancer, right?  And a lot of info coming out.  Yesterday, we reported that the doctor said he had five weeks to live.  And that was four weeks ago.  Yeah.  Now they're saying it's not that dire as reported yesterday.  But I couldn't pay my bill. 
[00:41:00]  So he's giving me another week.  Take my wife, please.  But he still has pancreatic cancer.  The doctors are optimistic.  Aren't they always?  But basically, this is a death sentence, this pancreatic cancer.  They say that only 5% of people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer live past five years.  How long he's had it?  I guess it all depends on how long you've had it, too, and how they catch it.  Well, I guess it's in the early stages, and he's responding to treatment, whatever that means.  Yeah.  Who doesn't respond in some way, shape, or form to treatment? 
[00:41:30]  He's responding to treatment.  His hair's falling out.  Right.  So Patrick Swayze, stars fight for life, front page of the paper today.  And that's the latest on that.  But he's filming a pilot.  Is he really?  Yeah.  Some kind of detective show.  Wow.  And they say he's still filming it.  The white cell hunter.  Poor bastard.  I hope he didn't sign up for eight episodes.  Poor fella. 
[00:42:00]  So we got our moving tribute today to Patrick Swayze.  Yes.  We wish him nothing but the best as we go to break here.  Might remember this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You remember the movie, of course.  Of course you do.  The music.  This is probably one of his most famous scenes.  Yeah.  But a little twist to it.  No one puts Patrick in a coffin.  Oh, Jesus.  No, because he's a fighter. 
[00:42:30]  What if he's a fan?  No, but he's not a fan.  He's famous.  But he's saying that.  But that's something he would say.  Yeah.  He's a tough guy.  That's true.  Swayze.  Yeah, of course.  So here's our moving tribute to Patrick Swayze as we go to break.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Oh, no, no.  Good morning, Bearman.  Why does that keep popping up?  I don't know, but, uh...  What the...  Wow. 
[00:43:00]  The disc is labeled retard-sync time of your life.  No, no.  I kind of, um...  Why is that popping up all over the place today?  It obviously got mixed up in the retard file.  But look, it says it right on there.  Time of my life.  Uh, yeah.  A little strange.  Time of Opie's life.  Something strange is going on today.  Back in his old radio career days.  E-Rock, you're going to help me out.  You actually got it, right?  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to go to the master computer.  This is our moving tribute to Patrick Swayze. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Oh.  Uh, good luck, bro, as we play this.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony.  I've had the time of my life  Now I've never felt this way before  Yes, I swear  It's the truth  And I owe it all to you  Cause I've had the time of my life 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, I've always felt the muse  I've been waiting for so long  Now I've finally found this one to stay by me  Yeah, we're riding on the wall  And you've felt the magic called fantasy  Yeah, we're passionate in our lives 
[00:44:30]  It's the way we could decide to speak with me  Yeah, we take each other's hands  Cause we didn't understand  The love of tea  Just remember what  You're the one  King and all  So I tell you something  This could be true 
[00:45:00]  Because  I've had the time of my life  That I've never felt this way before  Yes, I swear  It's the truth  That I owe it all to you  And my body and soul 
[00:45:30]  Can you know that you never know  So don't just let it go  Be afraid to lose control  You're a noise or you're mine  You're saying  Stay with me tonight  Me  Don't just let it go  Be afraid to lose control  I can't get enough of 
[00:46:00]  I'll tell you something  This time belongs  Because I had the time on the line  No one ever felt this way before  I swear it's the truth  That all of you are mine 
[00:46:30]  That's the time of my life  And I'm dying to be  And I'm dying to be  And I'm dying to be  And I'm dying to be 
[00:47:00]  Oh, I had the time on my line  And I never felt this way before  And I swear it's the truth 
[00:47:30]  And I owe it all to you  And I have the time on my line  No one ever felt this way before  And I swear it's the truth  That all of you are mine  That's the time on my line  And I swear it's the time on my line 
[00:48:00]  And I swear it's the truth  That all of you are mine  That's the time on my line  I've never felt this way before  And I swear it's the truth  And I know it all to you  And I have the time on my line

[00:52:30]  I'd say there's about an inch  An inch and a half on the ground  You can see right here  And maybe even  Maybe even a little more than two inches  But take a look over here on the roadway  Just in the last half hour or so  The flakes have begun  To stick a little bit on the asphalt  Now if you actually compare that  Oh, okay  He used a different thing  He didn't say asphalt  No, but he said ass blank  Yes  He said ass blank  The thing you're not allowed to say  Oh, and then he was flustered 
[00:53:00]  What made him say  What made him do that slip  How do you say ass blank  Instead of asphalt  Yeah  How great is that  That's a good one  He was flustered  Yeah  Assault  Assault  Fault  I love when they screw up like that  And just because we can  I gotta play this again  Thanks to AJ down there in Philly  But the park is still flooded  So you'll see kids out there again  Some of those kids today  Will be my co-host  Just like  Dude, you got the best barrels ever, dude

Out of Mastic, yes  All right, that's what we learned today  Too many mosquitoes in Mastic  And that was a bird's eye view  Into the scenic town  We hold close to our hearts  A Mastic moment  On the Opie and Anthony show  Oh, there it is  I want to apologize  To a guy named Jiven  A guy we don't really talk about much  On this radio show  But he works a mere  Couple doors down 
[00:55:30]  Here at K-Rock in New York City  And his whole job is  When I go to E-Rock  And I point  Yeah  E-Rock then goes  Go into a headset  And then Jiven goes  And pushes a button  Uh-huh  And that's pretty much all he does  Turn your key, sir  He really wants to do more in radio  But that's what he's doing right now  He's a tranny hunter  And poor Jiven  Because we've been doing this Mastic bit  Had to field a phone call  I don't know how they got a hold of him  Field a phone call  From a very, very pissed off  Female lawyer for Mastic 
[00:56:00]  Uh-oh  Who demands audio  From the Opie and Anthony show  Is she that slob  That was on the  I have no idea  The news  When the DJ gave the apology  Now is Jiven allowed  To come in here real fast  Or is  Or he can't leave his post  He might can't leave his post  No  Can we get a phone call  To him or something  Or maybe he could yell  From down the hall  Because he's right over there  It's right there  And we can't get him in here  Because he's busy  I hope he curses  And then has to pay the fine himself  But Jiven  I guess he answers phone calls  Because you know  People are calling the station 
[00:56:30]  Here in New York  This lady calls from Mastic  She's a female lawyer  And just gave him hell  Really  How dare you guys  Make fun of a town like Mastic  Um  How dare we  Because  How dare you  Because it stinks  She wants audio  She wants to talk to management  Because I've been to Mastic  And I know  It  It  It just blows  Right  How about if she's listening now  Probably is  Record it  Oh Jiven's on the dump  I don't like Mastic  Wait it was Jiven  Oh yeah Jiven's the dump guy

[01:29:00]  Saying how great we are  The show's awesome  Those guys are really good guys  Yeah  We enjoyed advertising with them  I don't know if this is going to help  Keep their jobs  But we felt like we had to write a letter  I just found that the other day  And then of course  They were involved with the  Sex for Sam thing  Down here in New York  Yeah  And they were also involved  With this  Hard debacle  Tina Tucker  Couldn't believe her luck  Last February  When she held  The winning key  In WAAS  Sam Adams  White Ale  Mustang contest  They gave me a key  Along with nine other people 
[01:29:30]  And we all had a chance  To try it  Mine started it  Tina won  A 1967  White Mustang  I know it wasn't going to be  Like a 1998 Mustang  But I never expected it  To be in this shape  Tina's prize  Had body rot  A bad paint job  Ripped seats  And broken equipment  And it wouldn't start  Piece of junk  It really is  All embarrassing  Piece of junk  It really is  It's embarrassing  It had body rot 
[01:30:00]  The seats were ripped  It wouldn't start  At a bad paint job  And this  I mean  You know  People know  Radio giveaways  By now  And you know  You always hear about  A station bragging  About giving away a car  This is what we gave away  A piece of S  Tina had the car  Toed to a repair shop  Where it's been  Virtually untouched  Since March  Because Tina says 
[01:30:30]  She couldn't get  WAAF to fix it  No  They have not been  Cooperative  Until  This past weekend  When you got in touch  With them  They had no part of me  My stepfather  Got in contact with them  They were very rude  To my father  And they have had  Nothing to do with me  They've washed the hands  Of me in this car  For the past five months  Five months  Five months  We were part of  One of those  Shame  Yeah  Shame  Shame  Shame on you  Get that camera  Out of my face  Yeah  We gave the bitch 
[01:31:00]  The car  Hey  Leave us alone  Oh  How bad was this  Oh yeah  And you get to hear  The voice  Of Dave Dickless  Ah  Ladies and gentlemen  I present to you  The douche  We're very much  A victim  As is Tina here  While they admit  Giving Tina  A seriously damaged car  WAAF management  Says it's not  Their fault  They blame  The people  From whom  They got the car 
[01:31:30]  We trusted  This organization  To deliver the vehicle  In good working order  And they didn't do that  That is Dave Dickless  We're just as much  A victim  As she is  Really Dave  Don't you remember  When we were starting  To question  Question  The giveaway  And you said  We're working  We'll have the car  Don't worry  Let's just make believe  We have it  Don't worry  We'll take care of it later  Yeah will ya  This is what happens  When you do things  Last minute  They were hoping  She would just go away  Yeah  And she went to the news  Yeah  They were hoping  Like that was 
[01:32:00]  Shame  Shame  Shame  Shame  Shame on you  Dave was just hoping  She'll go away  She got this piece  Of crap car  We won't have to deal  With it  And everyone  On the air  Heard us  Give away a car  Right  And she was happy  At the time  Yeah  Until she realized  What a piece of junk  It was  But she didn't go away  Sometimes she goes away  Sometimes she don't go away  ONA  Body rot  It was just  Yeah well 
[01:32:30]  Just a piece of crap  How great is this  How  You gotta see the whole clip  Cause the car  When you see the video  Of the car  Body rot  That we thought  Was good enough  For one of our listeners  Back in the day  I forgot that  There was a bunch of keys  Yeah  And whoever had the key  That started the car  Won the car  Yeah  And it actually started  That first time  But it was hit or miss  Well  Could have been  Well everyone loses  Actually we had it  Hooked up to a car  Behind  A little  The sports bar  Yeah  I think it needed to jump  I'm really surprised 
[01:33:00]  That Dave's  Not working on radio anymore  I know  Emotions like this  This is just terrific  He's the best  Which Marco  Runs the National Veterans Scholarship Fund  They resell donated cars  For scholarship money  And agreed to give  WAAF the Mustang  In exchange for free advertising  But Marco insists  The car was given  As is  It's basically  Here's your car  And that's it  Now that the promo's over  They're coming back to me  In fact  WAAF has contacted 
[01:33:30]  The Attorney General's office  Asking for an investigation  Of the National Veterans Scholarship Fund  But they didn't do it  Until the very day  We called  Asking about Tina's car  Of course  Shame  Shame  Shame  Shame on you  I'm Arnold Diaz  With my awful  70s porn mustache  It's typical  It is exactly like  These shame  Shame on you things  Yeah  Well it was called  On your side  I believe  On your side 
[01:34:00]  We're on your side  Knock  Knock  Knock  Knock  Knock  Knock  Knock  Dave Douglas  Program director  Do you have a comment  We're victims  We're victims too  Swear  We gave away a piece of crap  And we're victimized  Because now we look bad  What kind of victims  And then of course  You get this  This afternoon  WAAF assumed  Full responsibility  For the Mustang  Promising to pay  For its full refurbishing  And delivery to Tina  Within a month  And even though  They weren't directly 
[01:34:30]  Involved in the car deal  Sam Adams beer  Has vowed to make good  If WAAF doesn't  Poor Sam Adams  Yeah  Now I gotta pay  For a Mustang  Because of these jerks  Jim Cook had to  Follow us around  With a mop  To clean up everything  All the mess  We used to make  The mess  We left in our wake  Last time I talked  To Jim Cook  He's a great friend  Of this show  And he wants to  Advertise so badly  Oh I know  But man  The crap we've done  To him over the years  He's just not ready 
[01:35:00]  And unfortunately  Irreparable damage  To the relationship  I know  I really like you guys  A lot  But you suck  At advertising  For me  You've gotten me  In trouble  I was kicked off  Of my own commercials  For two years  They just brought him back  Right  Like recently  When they're doing  The Sam Adams spots  On TV  You just now see  Jim Cook  Back in the spots  He was  He was like  Thrown out of his own  Company for a while  Right  I suggest 
[01:35:30]  If you're listening  To BCN  You demand  That Jim Cook  Starts advertising  On BCN again  Oh god  Say I will not  Drink Sam Adams  Until Jim Cook  Is heard  On the O.P.

[01:41:00]  Here beat the Super Bowl  Oh yeah  The hype that  Came before it  Was amazing  Well you know  Live events  They really invented  Live events  In that sense  Yeah  Just huge  1986  Wow  This is my old hood  I used to have  My boxing gym  Right across the street  For eight years  Oh from here yeah  Right on 57th street  Did you fight  Before you were reporting  Not  I really became  A fighter  After I became  A local newsman  On Eyewitness News  Raising money  For the charity  I was involved in  With the Mentally Retarded 
[01:41:30]  The one that  John Lennon did  The concert for me  One to one  Yeah  And Wall Street  Had a Wall Street  Charity fund  And every year  They would pick a guy  That would bid  On who was going  To fight me  And that's how  I got into it really  And you hung  With John Lennon  That's like  Just amazing to me  Yeah  I mean we  We get to meet  A lot of celebrities  But wow  I mean John Lennon  He was such a New Yorker  At that time in his life  You know  He was playing  With elephants memories  Living with Yoko  Down in the village  And they actually  Saw my expose  On the Mentally Retarded  And Yoko called me  And went down  And hung out with them  Down there on Bank Street 
[01:42:00]  And they'd be in bed  All day  You have to  They had like  A railroad kind of apartment  You know  Just one room  Had to go into the next  And then you go  To the bedroom  In the back  And everyone  Sit on the bed  Just hang out  You know  You get loaded  And then you talk  About solving  The world's problems  How cool is that  And then  I asked  And they said  Yes they did  It was John's last  Fully rehearsed concert  Of his life  At Madison Square Garden  We did two shows  Along with  Shana Nas  Stevie Wonder  A bunch of others 
[01:42:30]  Raised a ton of money  And then later  When John was being  Deported  By the Nixon administration  And John Mitchell  Was the attorney general  I was one of the  Four witnesses  The character witnesses  To say  You know  You can't deport him  Because he got caught  Smoking dope  In the UK  Fifteen years ago  It's ridiculous  He's done so much good  He's helped so many  Of these kids out  Well Mitchell  Got his comeuppance  Yeah they all did  They all did  What goes around  Comes around  Yeah  You know  You gotta live long  Enough to see it  Now you're  I remember years ago 
[01:43:00]  The exposés  You were talking about  Like on Willowbrook  That was a type  Of guerrilla reporting  That just wasn't  Being done  Oh no  At that time  Even in the 60s  When Robert F. Kennedy  Was the senator  Here from New York  And he went there  And he came out  All shaken  And said it was  A snake pit  And everything  But there were  No pictures  No one had ever  Been allowed inside  New York  Is a very stringent  Privacy law  And so  How long can  Outrage last  If you don't have 
[01:43:30]  The visuals  To go with it  You know  That's  It's always  You know  These days  You get the visual  First  Then the outrage  Comes from that  So it was very difficult  But I got a key  I got a key  From an activist doctor  You know  Even the parents  Were part  In those days  Of the cover up  Because  It was the way  You cared for  You know  Everyone was embarrassed  To even admit  They had a  Developmentally  Disabled child  So that's just  The way you cared for  You put them  In a big institution  You shut them up  And once in a while  Maybe once a year  You go visit them  Did you have problems  Getting that past 
[01:44:00]  The network  That you were gonna  Good question  It got on so fast  You know  We filmed it  Out in Staten Island  It was the world's  Largest institution  For the mentally retarded  Came back  It was film in those days  It was just horrifying  Developed the film  Put it on the air  So now it was on  The 6 o'clock news  Now what were they  Gonna do  Then the lawyers  Got involved  Then everybody started  And then they  Censored it for a few days  Then even then  I said no  I'm not gonna go  For that anymore  The outrage  That built in the city  Was unbelievable  Yeah it was out there already 
[01:44:30]  So now it would be  Very hard to  Pull it back  At that point  Because people had seen it  They were outraged  But that kind of started  I really do think  That started  A genre  Of newscasting  That wasn't  Happening before that  And I agree  And I  For better or worse  Because it did kind of  Mutate into this  Sensationalist  Let's shove a camera  You know  In your face  Kind of a thing  But that was a noble  A very noble cause  And there has been  A lot of examples 
[01:45:00]  Of nobility  I think that it  Really was  The best example  Of television news  Being part of a process  Of positive social change  You don't get a lot  Of that these days  Not at all  And it's a lot better  Than what came from it  You know  The blow dry hair  And the  You know  Every chick is a blonde  You know  With big boobs  And every guy is  You know  He wants to be on  The cover of GQ  You know  And nobody wants to go out  And do anything anymore  And when they do  It is these kind of  You go up to  A rinky dink guy  With a garage  And say you're selling 
[01:45:30]  Bad tires to kids  Or something  Yeah  Back in the days  When you were doing  Those exposés  It was pretty much  Now let's go to  Our filthy hippie  Geraldo Rivera  I was definitely  You know  It was funny though  Eyewitness News  In those days  Was the first one  That really tried  To integrate  The news gathering team  We really did look like  The city that we were serving  Right  That was the first  You know  We kind of  Gravitated from that  To then everybody  Had to have one of each  Yeah  Yeah  But nowadays  You go back to cable news 
[01:46:00]  It is often  You know  A bunch of grumpy  Old white guys  Talking politics  And you know  We come full circle  In many ways  We mock the local news  To no end  On this radio show  I heard the shame  On you  My old man  That's just a piece  We do the news teases  We have a whole  News tease hall of fame  Of the ridiculous news tease  That gets you to listen  Or watch longer  We can't get enough  Local news sweeps  Are really  Dude  We sit in the office  At five  And watch the local news  And all we do  Is laugh openly 
[01:46:30]  How awful it is  And just hacky it is  I had you guys  Hook up anyway  Me and Ant  Yeah  It was the OJ Simpson thing  Strangely enough  We were talking about that earlier  Before we hit the air  Yeah  I was in bands  My whole life  And wrote song parodies  And wrote one about OJ  And sent it into Opie  And he said  Oh come on and perform it live  So me and my brother came on  And me and him  Just started talking  And he goes  Hey you want to do radio  I was in construction  And where was your first station  Jersey?  No  Long Island  B-A-B 
[01:47:00]  Oh B-A-B  Yeah this whole show  Run up 109 there  This whole show is  Yeah on today  Because OJ killed  Based on OJ  Simple as that  I was exploring the hell out of it  And he came with the song  And the rest is history  You know I had a good OJ run  Yeah yeah  I still hate him  You got to interview Michael Jackson  You were one of the only guys  That got to talk to him  During the trial  I mean did you really  You're a smart dude  Do you really honestly believe  That he didn't do it  Or was it  You know  Like look I want to interview this guy  Well let me put it this way 
[01:47:30]  There's no  When you figure that he had  The witness against him  Hired the same psychologist  Who got the last settlement  The same lawyer  Who got the last settlement  It was so clearly entrapment  Maybe he had done it  To other children before  I don't know that  But they had no evidence  That he did this kid  It was  They went to court  In a case that was  I  Reason I said to everybody  That if he was convicted  I would shave my mustache  You remember that?  Yeah  The reason I said that  Is because I was certain  That there was no way  Any jury was going to convict him  Beyond the reasonable doubt 
[01:48:00]  On the evidence that they had  It was totally trumped up  So as a guy  You were looking at it  More like legally  No no I'm a lawyer  I was looking at it as a lawyer  I said no there's just no way  But not as like  I don't think he did it  But more like  I don't think they can prove he did it  Whether Michael Jackson  Is a pervert  Is not what I was talking about  What I was talking about  Is did they have him  On this particular case  You know  It's one thing to say  The guy's a pervert  It's another thing to say  He did this boy  In this way  On that day  That's very  It's a hard burden of proof  And when you  And you look at the mother 
[01:48:30]  She was later convicted  Of welfare fraud  And all the rest of it  They were totally trying  To soak him for money  When he had money  Now he's busted in  You know  Neverland  Or whatever they call it  Did you see the picture  Of Neverland?  Yeah  It's just completely  Falled apart  Looks like I am legend  Yeah  I went there  I brought the kids there  They loved it  The movie theater  I don't know  I hope  They were girls  They still are  There's so much 
[01:49:00]  To talk to you about  But one of my favorite  Things that Geraldo's  Done recently  Is just go after  Bill O'Reilly  When that was  I go over to Lou Doves  And Lou Doves  I didn't see that one  I saw the Bill O'Reilly  Thing live  I actually watch  Bill O'Reilly  Because I like  Being pissed  I don't like the guy  He did a thing on us  That we never forgot  We were just  New in the business  And stuff  Starting to get  Some national attention  We went on  You know  The O'Reilly  The spin zone  Whatever  The O'Reilly factor  The no spin zone  He spins more than  Freaking anyone out there 
[01:49:30]  And we did this  Great taped interview  And this is what's  Going to make Geraldo laugh  And we were sitting there  For over an hour  And he's asking  All these questions  And we're  Showing some intelligence  We really are  Then we watched  The piece he actually  Runs on TV  It's all about sex  This  Making us look like  Complete dopes  And we learned a lesson  You know  Finally  The lesson is  Don't do taped interviews  And don't think  That Bill O'Reilly  Wants to talk to  Opie and Anthony  About all the good issues  The good things we're doing  Because we're talking  About politics  You came from Huntington  How can you be that night  We're talking about  Politics 
[01:50:00]  Religion  All that was just  Left on the editing floor  We learned a lesson that day  But when you went  After him that day  I was like  Right on  You really dislike him  For real  Like you really don't  Like him as a guy  No that's not true  Because just like  We all have a kind  Of similar background  Everybody with a  Microphone right now  We're kind of  Blue collar background  A lot of Long Island  And New York City  O'Reilly comes from  The same kind of background  So I don't dislike him  In that sense  I mean he's  He's an unusual guy  To get along with  He's kind of distant 
[01:50:30]  And he's  You know  He worries about  You know  Who's going to use him  He's on the top of his game  He's number one  And cable  And all the rest of it  But I kind of  Sympathize with him  But I disagree with him  On everything  And this particular day  Or evening  He was talking  He was really scapegoating  Illegal immigrants  For everything  An illegal immigrant did  He was talking about  This particular night  It was a drunk driver  Who killed two kids  In Virginia  It was a tragic story  But there were  350 other drunk driving  Fatalities in Virginia 
[01:51:00]  That year  And it was the first one  We were talking about  And that was part of a pattern  The scapegoating  This very vulnerable class  That really  It led me to write this book  And everything  The book is called  Hispanic  I'm reading it  Hispanic  It's Hispanic  But it's white  Hispanic is the way  I say it too  Right, right, right  It's like when people  Break down history  Into historic  It's about  Why Americans fear  Hispanics in the U.S.  Is it like  Because my problem  With immigration  Is not that  Hispanics are coming here  I only ask that people  Try to immigrate legally  And just try to 
[01:51:30]  Kind of assimilate  Into the culture  A little bit  Like when you look  At Asians  Asians are very  Very  They speak English  To each other  That's all I kind of ask  That people attempt  To kind of assimilate  Into what we do here  There are many millions  Of Chinese  Who are here illegally  The second largest group  So everybody wants  To get here  That's a fact of life  And to me  If you want to talk  About illegal immigration  That's okay  I mean it's a real  Social issue  And I totally get it  But you don't blame them  For all the crime  The disease  The terror  The stealing jobs 
[01:52:00]  When the facts  Don't support that  And you don't show  A Mexican jumping over  A fence every time  You're doing it  It's like  It's like me  On Al Capone  And Opie and Anthony  On you know  The various  Church sects  And things  The various  It's  You know  After a while  It's a stereotype  And after a while  It conveys  A very negative message  That is at its heart  Racial  So you're saying  That in a way  They're going to show  The fence jumping  From Mexico  Show the Irish bartenders  Show the 
[01:52:30]  You know  The European au pair  Show the other people  Who are here illegally  Shipping containers  The people  Of Asians  The people who  Knocked down 9-11  All came on  Student or tourist visas  That they overstayed  They were all from  Saudi Arabia  Why did the Mexicans  Take the rap for 9-11  It's just not right  Do you think  That they should  Do something  With immigration  Just to make sure  That the process  Is followed legally  Yes  And you know  I think that  John McCain  And Ted Kennedy  Had a good bill  Bush  The best thing  He ever did  He ever did  In his presidency  The only thing 
[01:53:00]  That I think  That is universally  Applauded  At least by my crowd  It was the immigration  Reform bill  That was defeated  Last year  It had border security  Which is a good idea  You've got to secure  The borders  To have a sovereign nation  But it also had  A way to normalize  The existence  Of everyone in this room  Has  Knows illegal immigrants  Or they mow your lawn  Or they babysit your kid  Or they wash the dish  In the bar  Or the restaurant  You go to  They deliver you a pizza  Everybody  They drive the livery cab  Everybody knows 
[01:53:30]  That the situation exists  You've got to get these people  Out of the shadows  Get them so they can pay taxes  So the kids can  Have a life  Where you know  That ICE agents  Aren't going to be  Smashing in your door  At two in the morning  So are you for an amnesty then?  Basically  I am basically  But you know  When you say that word  It automatically turns  On people immediately  Yeah it does  What I prefer is to say  An earned path  To citizenship  Let them come to  The Walmart parking lot  You take their picture 
[01:54:00]  You take their fingerprints  You do a criminal background check  You find out who they are  So first of all  You do your inventory  On who's here  Then you give them  Some kind of visa  Some kind of legal visa  Where they could have a job  Where they can pay taxes  And you know  Have a normal existence  And then if Congress  Or the American people  Want to give them a path  To become American citizens  That's fine  My whole beef right now  Is that these people  Are living in terror  And it ebbs and flows  Depending on the political whim  It's being driven  This savage anti-immigration 
[01:54:30]  Movement is being driven  By the most egregious  Talk radio campaign  Even much worse than  Bill Clinton  And Monica Lewinsky  And impeachment  This is the worst thing  That ever happened  Can I tell you the thing  That bothers people the most  I think at least  At least personally  It is a feeling  That people who come  Don't want to  It's so stupid  But to learn English  That's not true  I'm just telling you  That's the vibe people get  But I'm saying  A lot of people  Do not speak the language  My dad is one of 17 children 
[01:55:00]  From Puerto Rico  My 17 children  Wow  Same mother  Same father  My dad came in 1937  And he  You know  During the depression  He got the  You know  He really got discriminated against  In every kind of way  Every one of the 17  My 16 aunts and uncles  Everyone in my generation  Speaks English  Older generation  Everyone  The problem is  That our children  Or even us sometimes  Don't speak Spanish  Every survey showed  That the Mexicans  Are learning English  At the same rate  As any other immigrant group  That came before  When you hit the phone 
[01:55:30]  I mean  And I understand  That's a decision  Big business makes  Because they want  But when you pick up the phone  And say press one for English  Press two for Spanish  I mean you don't see that  With other nationalities  Or other languages  What's the big deal about that  What are you going to be  If you touch two by mistake  Is your finger going to rot  I mean I don't understand  What the big deal is  No one minds choices  But the thing is  This is New York City  Yeah but it's all over the country  And it's also being done  To make it so people  Don't have to learn English  That's the key  It's not about  But I'm saying  Every survey shows  They're learning English  At the same or faster rate  Than any other  Than the Irish 
[01:56:00]  The Germans  The Italians  The European Jews  That came  The Asians you spoke of  You go to Brown University  You see a graduation  A guy might look like  He works in a Chinese restaurant  This kid is the valedictorian  Of the graduating class  You know that's just  The immigrant social mobility  That happens  Has happened  Will happen  The Hispanics aren't  The last group  There'll be some  You know I don't know  Pacific Islanders  Or you know  Central Africans  Will be coming next  But do you think  That it's the more  That you make it comfortable 
[01:56:30]  For people  In any language  To not learn  The language  The less likely  They'll be to learn  It just because  They can live a very comfortable  And productive life  Not knowing it  But I'm telling you  That if you could find me  A second generation  Hispanic immigrant  Who doesn't speak English  I'll give you a hundred dollars  I'll give you a hundred bucks  Second generation  You mean  I'm not sure  My generation  Okay  I'm not talking about older  I think with older  It's like  Again the Italians came over  They had to learn it  No no  I'm saying that  The children of immigrants  You go to Miami  Miami is a place  Where Spanish speaking people 
[01:57:00]  Are extremely comfortable  In a Spanish world  You know  The number one rated TV shows  The number one rated radio shows  The best restaurants  The best clubs  You know  Some of the best condos  You go there  Invariably  Those young people  Speak English  They eat Big Macs  They watch MTV  They listen to Opie and Anthony  They don't exist  And they speak Spanish  To their parents  That's just the way  It's always been  That's the way  It'll always be  Okay so you don't think  That there's like  A larger group of say 
[01:57:30]  People coming in from Mexico  Or Spanish immigrants  Who don't speak English  Than any other nationality  I think there's a larger group  Coming in from Mexico  Than anything  Since the Irish  The only thing that matches  This exceptional immigration  Is when  650,000 Irish  Came in two years  To New York City  Doubled the population  Of New York  In two years  And instantly became  The second largest  Ethnic group  And they had the same  Exact reaction  The nativist  Know nothing  You know 
[01:58:00]  These people are here  To undermine  Speaking that wretched  Gaelic  They want to  The Catholic Church  Is going to subvert  The real church  It was the same  You could read the headlines  From the 1846  It could be  You know  2008  You know  And I just think  That if people  Just cool down  Put it in the historic context  Give  Give facts  A chance  As opposed to  The hysteria  From talk radio  And from cable news  We can only live  Our own experience  So  I don't 
[01:58:30]  My experience  On a day to day basis  And this is everywhere I travel  Is that I am much more likely  To encounter people  Who are speaking Spanish  That don't understand English  Than any other language  In what context?  Whether you're  In a store  Or you're having something  Delivered  You go to a store  And the guy doesn't speak English?  You go to a bodegas  Where people hardly speak English  Of course  You go to a bodegas  People don't comprehend  You shop at a bodega?  Well I don't think  I buy my lunch furniture there  But you're acting like  It's crazy for me to say  That we encounter  A lot of Spanish people  That don't speak English 
[01:59:00]  And it's not crazy to say  And in our common experience  We know that that's not crazy  But how does that  Why does that  Assuming that's true  And I'll take you at your word  What's the problem?  Because again  That's one of the resentments  People have  But why do you have resentment?  Why?  I'm explaining to you  Because you want people  To come here  And assimilate into the culture  That you have here  That's all it is  And that's why I said  It's not about people  Being Spanish  Or not wanting Spanish people here  So you don't think  That the child of that person  In the bodega  That you could not  Communicate with  Which I think is a little  I don't know  I could communicate 
[01:59:30]  With everybody  Well of course I speak Spanish  You don't think  That their kid  Will be speaking English?  It depends on how easy  It's made for him  To not speak English  In certain places  Like I said  I'd pay you  If you find a kid  Born here  Or even a young person  Brought in here  Who doesn't speak English  Because I don't see it anywhere  In Los Angeles  There's huge groups  Of people  That speak very  Very minimal English  Their parents  Yeah  And their grandparents  But they're not attempting  It's almost like  It's acceptable  But see that's a stereotype  Where does that come from?  The truth  Stereotypes are based on truth 
[02:00:00]  But from your experience  How much time  Do you spend hanging out  In East L.A.  Really?  Well not a tremendous amount  Of time  I'm only going by  My own experience  But it's like  I'm not the only one  Having this experience  It's not like  Jim Norton  Is just saying this  It's a tremendous amount  Of people  Who are kind of reacting  In the same way  That the vast majority  Of people  Have the most virulent  Anti-immigration sentiment  Have never even seen  An illegal immigrant  Much less had a negative experience  But you're saying  That everyone deals with them  You're saying  That every one of us  Deals with them  You're saying  That in one breath  Some people have never  Dealt with illegals  And you're saying  That every one of us  Deals with them 
[02:00:30]  On a daily basis  And you go to Los Angeles  There's scarcely  A baby cared for  A lawn mowed  A dish washed  In a restaurant  Or a bar  Or a factory  Where a shirt is sewed  Except by an illegal immigrant  And I'm not saying  They're contributing more  To the economy  Every study shows  Than they take away  From the economy  That's the reality  See and again  I might even disagree  With that  It is simply  People see it becoming  Much more acceptable  Hit two for Spanish  And you're like  Why does that matter  Instead of saying  You know what  That's correct  That does kind of  Make it a lot easier 
[02:01:00]  For people to not  Because one  If you have one country  It's a little bit easier  If everybody kind of  Has a common language  And a common culture  Hit two for Spanish  First of all  Those are private companies  I know  I do that  Because they want to make money  Absolutely  They do it to make money  Because this is a good market  For them  That's why  You know  You get radio stations  That are converting  To Spanish language  Because they make money  Spanglish is huge  Right  Here in town  That's the number one station  Yeah  Two of them  Two of the top  Three or four  Yeah  You know  It's a big business 
[02:01:30]  Of course  I'm not saying that it's not  But there's a need for it  I mean  That's why they're doing it  I mean  If it was to speak a language  That nobody here speaks  They wouldn't do it  Because it wouldn't make sense  But obviously  There's a huge market for that  I just think that  What everybody has to do  Is cool your jets  Like I told O'Reilly that night  Stop  Stop the scapegoating  You know  A study came out  Last Monday  That you never would see  On cable news  Or hear on talk radio  There's a study  By the Public Policy Institute  Of California  It showed  Mexican immigrants 
[02:02:00]  Between 18 and 40  Were eight times  Less likely  To commit crimes  And be incarcerated  Than citizens  You will never see  That study anywhere  Eight times less likely  You know  It's because the images  That these people  Because the phony stories  By people like Lou Dobbs  They're bringing in leprosy  They're raping our children  They're eating our sandwiches  You know  It just goes on and on and on  I'm the only person  Speaking in their favor  And I'm not even disagreeing  With anything you're saying  On that  I am saying that  You're disagreeing  With everything  I'm saying  No  I haven't 
[02:02:30]  You haven't agreed  With one thing  I said  I haven't mentioned crime  I haven't said anything  About how  I didn't say  Amnesty was wrong  I didn't say  Get people out there  Ruining the country  I'm only saying  Not at all  You're pinning me  With O'Reilly  And that's not  The point I'm making  I'm only saying  That one of the resentments  People have  Or the main issue  For me  Is you just want to feel  Like when people come here  They come here  Through a legal process  And they kind of  Assimilate to  And attempt to learn  The language  And the culture  And you're saying  That's not true  They all speak English  And I'm saying  That a common experience  Dictates that  That's not the truth  I did not say  They all speak English 
[02:03:00]  I said they are learning English  At the same or faster rate  Than any other  Previous immigrant group  And I'm also saying  That every previous immigrant group  Had the same kind of thing  Said about them  That's all I'm saying  This is part of a historic process  But then you're saying  We are a nation of immigrants  But you're saying  It's racist though  If every group  Has that happen  If you show a Mexican  Every time you're talking about  You know  You ever watch Lou Dobbs  You ever see these programs  You got to watch these  Every time  There's not a single night  And I talked to Dobbs yesterday 
[02:03:30]  There's not a single night  Where you don't see a picture  Of a Mexican  Climbing over that damn fence  Not one night  And the FBI released  The study on the spike  In violent crime last year  The spike in violent crime  They led on CNN  With the news that  Violent crime is spiked  Obviously tied to the wave  Of illegal immigration  Even though the FBI  Never mentioned immigration  In their study  And in fact  The cities that had  The spike in violent crime  St. Louis  Detroit  Cleveland  Philadelphia  Had zero 
[02:04:00]  Or almost no immigration  Illegal or otherwise  So you're saying it's plaques  Do you  I'm kidding  Do you think  Like people  People do like  You're right about one thing  I'm not saying  You're saying that like  Well people  Make it a racial issue  Every time  But don't you think  Sometimes that when people  Raise legitimate issues  About the immigration  That race has fallen back on  As an excuse  Instead of addressing  I don't think so  I  Listen  You're saying that race  You read that book  You read those emails  That I've gotten  You know I'm a person 
[02:04:30]  Who's been on television  Now for almost 40 years  In some ways  And I say this  I'm like  Big pens  You don't think of  Scandinavia  Or France  When you hear big pens  Or Legos  You don't think of  Scandinavia  Toyota  You don't think of Japan  Geraldo  You don't necessarily  Think of Hispanic  Or Puerto Rican  It's just  I've been around so long  That I have like  A generic brand  I'm just Geraldo  And yet  You  I wouldn't even say  You have to bleep out  With the language  But the turd in the toilet bowl  Why don't you go back home  To  I was born on 17th Street 
[02:05:00]  They want me to go back home  To where  What the Lower East Side  You know  That's not  It is racist  In its content  The most vehement  And virulent  Of the language  Is racially based  You don't  It is inevitable  And when you read it  Lou Dobbs  The number one guy  On the  You know  The hate mongering  Group's  Websites  They're all listening  The KKK  Has made a tremendous  Comeback  Since the year 2000  You know  The Minutemen now  You think the Minutemen  Would be so  Outraged 
[02:05:30]  Mabel  Let's go  We gotta stop  These illegal immigrants  The Swedes  Are coming in  From Canada  You know  Call the FBI  Call the CIA  Call the NHL  You know  You gotta stop  These Swedes  You know  It's just not  Gonna happen  It is because  There is a browning  Process going on  The country is  Changing  Demographically  There are more  Hispanics  There were 4 million  In 1950  Now there's 45 million  That's what this is  Really  But how is it racist  If it's a process  I know we have to take a break  If every group  Goes through the process  How is it racist  If it's a part of the process 
[02:06:00]  That every group  Has gone through  I'm just telling you  The reaction  The real life  Real world reaction  You can say  That in your heart of hearts  It has nothing to do  With the fact  That they have brown skin  That they look different  But I think  That at its heart  That's what's going on here  It's who we are  As a nation  And the fear  That the nation is changing  Alright well  I'm telling you  That's not where I'm coming from  Good  That's why you're going to  Give me breakfast  You've got to come back  You've got to come back  Because unfortunately  We've run out of time  It was fun  We just scratched the surface  What he was your hit man today

[02:07:00]  It is a way for wimpy guys  Little dick wimpy guys  To attack someone  Who they know  Could eat them for lunch  Hey we have to take a break  Geraldo Rivera  Hispanic or hispatic  Why Americans fear Hispanics  In the US  Thank you  What's the answer  To that question by the way  Why  I just said  I'm just kidding  We ran through that one  The great Geraldo Rivera  Please come back  And we'll talk about this  And other  We have so much  That we want to talk to you about

[02:09:30]  Opie and Anthony  It's Opie and Anthony  Busy morning  Geraldo Rivera was great  We could have done  At least another hour with him  We gotta get him back on the show  Sooner than later  He was defending points  I wasn't making  I didn't think  Jimmy would be such  Instigator  Oh shut up  You were just being nasty  To our guest  I was telling Jimmy  Before Geraldo came in  I'm like  You're a little quiet today  He goes  I'm just enjoying you  And it going back and forth  And then boom  He becomes the star  Of the show  He chimes in 
[02:10:00]  Him and Geraldo  Going out  Like a maniac  I thought he was gonna  Bust a chair across your nose  It was very interesting  Radio  Absolutely  Jimmy who do we got in  I'm very psyched  We have Isaiah Whitlock  From The Wire  Of course  You prefer the junior  Or should I leave it off  You can put it on  Okay Isaiah Whitlock Jr  Thank you  I'm going to attempt  Banga  How do you say the last name  Akinabe  Akinabe  How do you say it  Akinabe  I actually just tried to do  An impression of him  Saying his own name  And I screwed it up  Yeah  Who play  Clay Davis 
[02:10:30]  And Chris the Assassin  From The Wire  And man  I am really  A tremendous fan of this show  Yeah  Can I say something really fast  Because you got two different fans here  Jimmy's up to date  And he's gonna be watching  The series finale  On Sunday on HBO  I'm on season two  Wow  Now I know you  I don't know you  And I met him  And I  I have a feeling  I know exactly  What role he's gonna play  Yeah  I have no doubt about it  That you're a badass  Mother effer  I don't know what season 
[02:11:00]  But I have no doubt  In my mind  Season three is when I start  Yeah  Jimmy says you're just huge  And I can't wait to get to your  Your part  What he just did right now  I've never seen  It's a smile  I've never seen you smile before  Oh that's funny  When Tristan was in yesterday  We were talking  One of my favorite scenes  In the entire series  Is when you beat down  His stepfather  He's one that was  Beating the stepfather  To death physically  Right  This kid's stepfather  And you're beating him  It's a savage beating  And as you're beating him  You watch this 
[02:11:30]  And you realize  This happened  To him  Yeah  To you  Like this abuse  This assassin  Right right  There's some kind of  Sexual abuse thing  Storyline  It never gets said  It never gets said  It's done in a look  And then in the beating  And the passion in the beating  Exactly  I mean it's unlike  Any other killing  That Chris does before  You know he's very cold  Methodical  And here he just snaps  And it's just  The writing is so good  They don't spoon feed it to you  It's like very subtle  And they don't mention it again  Either you get it  Or you don't  And they move on  Yeah they really do  They skate right by it 
[02:12:00]  And of course  The only person  I think who's probably  Like a swarthier  On the show  Than you  Has to be  The senator  Yeah  I felt sort of slighted  When he said  You know I can look at you  And see you're a badass  And I thought  Well okay  Alright  You're a smooth ass  Yeah right  Very smooth  Very good  Still an ass  Still an ass  Yeah  Shady smooth ass  We had  I don't know  I wish we had more time  Because we had  We had  Jamie was supposed to be in today  And he went up  Doing another interview 
[02:12:30]  But I had clips of him  And we had a great clip of you  Just talking to the mayor  Describing how you will  Accept money  Hey I got that  I think we have time  Why don't we hear that  This is Senator  This shows you exactly  Who Clay Davis is  In the show  Yeah Senator Davis  Of course  Played by Isaiah Whitlock Jr  Here you go  Money laundering  Ain't gonna come  Talk to me about  Money laundering  In West Baltimore  Where do y'all think  I'm gonna raise cash  For the whole damn ticket  From laundromats  And  From some 
[02:13:00]  Tiny ass  Korean groceries  You think I have time  To ask a man  Why he giving me money  Or where he gets  His money from  I'll take any  Money if he giving it away  I don't wanna know  I know you don't wanna know  But I'm scratching  And clawing  To get it done  For you Clarence  For you and me  And the rest of the team  And who comes through my dough  But a Baltimore city police  Looking to get up  Into my  S***  Ballet  You didn't know about that  I'm sorry  I got to leave up  Out of here  Before I lose  My damn mind  Nobody know about that 
[02:13:30]  You wanna run a campaign  With my money  Pillowed under your ass  You need your people  To back the  S*** up Clarence  Oh man  You just are fantastic  This is drug dealer money  He's talking about  Do you think I have time  To ask where it comes from  There's bushels of cash  Being carried out of the projects  With bodies piling up  He's got cocaine  Over every dollar bill  Just a casual conversation  With the mayor of Baltimore  You're acting like  It was a slightly 
[02:14:00]  Misappropriated  He's the dirtiest son of a bitch  In the entire show  And a badass  See  Now I can say badass  But it really is amazing  How interesting they've made  This politician  Like they've taken  Every character on this show  And I know  I obsess over the show  Because the fact that  It's never won an Emmy  It's just  It's almost  It's just embarrassing  And it's almost better  That it's never won  Because it just shows you  How awful the Emmys can be  I mean Sopranos is a good show  But I mean there's no one  On that show to me  With the complexity  Of what happens on this show  Yeah absolutely  I agree  I agree  Now are you allowed to say  What happens in the final episode 
[02:14:30]  I can't  Of course  You know  I mean  It would just  I mean sometimes  When I talk to people  You know  And I start talking  About certain things  And I'll say  Oh you know  I had to go and  Get this guy to be  Like my lawyer  And they say  Oh so  Why'd you need a lawyer  That means you gotta indict it  That means that  This is going to happen  So I usually just  Try and say nothing  Are we gonna get a  A big wow  At the end of the show  Or a  That's it  You're not gonna give us  A Sopranos ending  Are you  You're not gonna be 
[02:15:00]  Sitting there eating onion rings  At the end of this damn thing  Are you  Well  That was good  How you slipped that in there  You know  I want a big  I want you guys to go out  And a bang  I hope so  Were you surprised  Omar got killed  Did you guys  Were you shocked  When you saw the script  Like wow  They're really not gonna allow  This final gun battle  To happen  I was surprised  Like the actor in me  Because from the beginning  Of me being on the show  Everyone's like  It's gonna be you  And Omar eventually  And I just saw that coming 
[02:15:30]  But the writer in me  Is like  This is fascinating  How they did this  You know  It was fascinating  It really  It's amazing  What  Marlo  Who is his boss  Who is the boss of Chris  On the show  What a sociopath  Like you didn't think  It could get any worse  Than Barksdale  Or any of those guys  Or Weebae  I think his name was  On the first season  And man  You bastards  Roll the law  And they're just  The worst people alive  I mean  They shoot you  Without a facial expression  I thought the way 
[02:16:00]  They took out  Prop Joe  Was one of the most  One of the coldest  Oh damn  You know  The telegun  Hey hey  Hey  He's on the second season  I love that  It's getting room for him  I totally forgot  No no  But they just took him out  He had a cup of coffee  You know  That's all I was gonna say  You know  Of course  They had to beat him  Tried father  Tristan sat down yesterday  Off mic  The first thing he said is  And when they kill  Stringer Bell  And he's like  I'm on season two 
[02:16:30]  Stringer Bell's still alive  And well  And running things  And running things  That was the clip  I had them pull actually  To me that was  I mean the scene  That you guys did  In the jail cell  Where he's saying  My name is my name  Was a very intense scene  But that scene  With Prop Joe  Which was like  The only moment of compassion  In any way shape or form  He shows  In the entire series  Was close your eyes  It'll be over quick  That was like his idea  Of being gentlemanly  Nice  He respected Joe  Other than  The shady stuff 
[02:17:00]  That Joe was doing  He respected  Joe's position  So he's like  This was him  Respecting that  And close your eyes  You know  Because when you play  This game  You gotta know  That you know  Any minute  Anywhere  Anyone can take you out  It's not  It's not a minute  It's not about  This is unfair  This is unfair  This part of playing the game  You know  You're complicit  So yeah  It was wild  So obviously  Marlo  I know  I saw in the coming  Attractions  I saw the coming  Attractions  Because I'm on demand  I was always watching  The league earlier  And they make me wait  Now for two weeks 
[02:17:30]  They show that he's  Out of jail  So I mean  I'm hoping something  Kind of goes down  With him  I mean I know  You can't say  Exactly what happens  Marlo ends up  Running for mayor  You know what  Look  Barry and Barry won  That wouldn't actually  That wouldn't actually  Be too big of a stretch  I'm working on  An Obama Davis ticket  Obama Clay Davis ticket  You know  I can't tell you  How this show  Has wrote me in  And every angle  They cover  It's almost like 
[02:18:00]  Your storyline  As this dirty senator  Is as interesting to me  As the drug storyline  The newspaper  One I like  But I much prefer  You guys  Because you have  Been watching  Since day one  And you know  It's what  With the politics  And what's going on  In the police department  A lot of it's the same  Stuff that's going on  In the streets  They just happen  To have badges  And positions  In the street hall  I mean same conversations  A lot of the same  Back dealing  It's crazy  We just were talking  About it off the air  How he said  Some of the same things  In dealing with the mayor  In that excerpt 
[02:18:30]  That some of the kids  When offered drug money  Ended up saying  You know  Just taking this money  And moving it around  This and that  It's crazy  Yeah  You guys  What five seasons  Yeah  Fifth season  Ending  How do you feel  About that  I mean I'm sure  You'd like to keep  Working on it  But you know  I sort of feel like  You know  You reach that point  Where you know  It's time to move on  You know  I mean sure  You know  You love doing the show  You want to do the show 
[02:19:00]  But when you know  All things come to an end  And when it's time  Time to go  You got to go  It  I'm glad we're sort of  Going out  What I feel is on top  You know  Where people didn't  Like get tired  Of the show  And say you know  It went on like  Two seasons  Too long  But the big difference  To me  Was that we didn't  Like get cancelled  I mean  The show came to an end  So it wasn't like  You walked in  And it was like  Oh my god  I don't have a job  You know  You had a whole 
[02:19:30]  You had a whole season  To say goodbye  To everybody  You know  Don't say that too loudly  Does that happen  To someone in this room  On the same channel  That you guys are on too  Oh yeah  Okay  Alright  Alright  Lucky Lily  You know  But you know  I watched the show  Oh thank you  I watched it  Okay  I've seen you  Period  I thought it was  A semicolon  Yeah  Yeah  Timmy was hoping  Like a hand  A hand 
[02:20:00]  You know what  I don't even watch  Comedians  But I stayed up  And I watched  Like your special  Oh wow man  Thank you  That's funny  It was  And still waiting  For the end  No that's the thing  Just the fact  Just the fact  That this ruthless  Psychopath  Knows who I am  Which  Anyway  Again  Sorry I made you guys wait  It was just  Geraldo was there  We were running  A little bit late  But we have  The Wire series finale  By far the best show  On television  I mean it's by far  The Emmys are just  A completely irrelevant

[02:28:00]  And do what you make me think of  In the world of Radio Shock Shock  The biggest are Opie and Anthony  These people say shocking things  That border on offensive  In order to entertain their options  I refuse to sit here  And think that radio has to be nice  Why?  Why does radio  Out of any other medium  Have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard  Where we have to be nice  And make people feel good 
[02:28:30]  Go screw  Radio Bad Boys  Opie and Anthony  Controversial radio personalities  Opie and Anthony  Intimous DJs  Opie and Anthony  Talk show radio hosts  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  Radio Shock Jocks  Opie and Anthony  There was some dude who liked horses and liked the radio show  and named his horses after us.  And then let them starve.  And then let them starve.  Great.  Kind of like what we're doing for the listeners.  Starving them of entertainment. 
[02:29:00]  They are sick.  Freak.  Bobby, please look.  There's one part we want you to see.  That's easy.  Oh, you okay?  So where entertainment is going?  These guys are watching porn.  What are we talking about?  Oh, my God.  We're done.  We're out.  What is this?  No.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:29:30]  And we're off and running.  Very good news.  The guys made the walk.  Yes.  The guys from the wire made the walk, which we're very happy about  because now we're done with that bullshit radio show.  Now we can get into some shit.  I was talking to Ben Guy after the show, and I'm like, come on.  He's a nice guy.  I can tell.  And I'm only two seasons into the wire.  I'm like, how could this guy be a badass?  Look at him smiling.  He's making me laugh.  He probably likes going and seeing chick flicks. 
[02:30:00]  He bought two if I see the director's cut.  That's what's going to be fun for me, though, because like I said,  Jimmy told me about the wire.  I'm like, yeah, I'll get to it.  I'll get to it.  I finally got the box set, and I'm hooked to the point where my girl is  really frustrated because I'm like, it's wire time.  Sorry.  I'll be in this other room for the next hour and a half to two hours.  I've got to get at least three episodes in tonight because I'm trying to  catch up fast.  And I obviously know him because he's in the earlier seasons, 
[02:30:30]  but I don't know you at all.  So when he pops up on the screen and he's going to be this badass,  he's going to be like, wow.  There's just something really, really detached and frightening about his  character.  It's like the new crop of guys that they bring up, whether it's him  and it's Marlo and it's Snoop, it's really, really, they're murderous  people.  I mean, whereas like, you know, with Barksdale, you feel like, well,  he's got some kind of a code, he's a warrior, and these guys are just  cold-blooded.  Ruthless.  Ruthless murderers.  Which, look, that's the reality.  I've heard.  The suburban idiot. 
[02:31:00]  Pontificate like I ran with that.  Look at you.  That's how it is on the street.  Yeah.  Like Jimmy knows.  Yeah.  I said it yesterday when they filmed these scenes on the streets of  Baltimore and the projects and stuff.  I'm like, there's no way these guys are actors.  It's just way too real.  And I even asked that yesterday if they're using some extras and stuff,  and for the most part, no, right?  It's funny you say that.  No, they do use extras and people from Baltimore, but oftentimes I'll get  stopped in L.A. or New York and people will say to me, what are you doing here?  They expect me to be on a corner in Baltimore. 
[02:31:30]  I'm like, I'm an actor.  It's wild.  People don't realize that.  But I think it's credit to the show.  Oh, yeah.  You know, it may also be why this show doesn't get nominated because they don't  think they're actors.  Well, no, I think that's right.  You know, they say, well, they're just like people and they're not actors.  It was just people that got off the street and so on.  Yeah, they just got fun.  Some people on the show, which is true.  They went out and got 40 people to do a show on ESPN. 
[02:32:00]  I am one of those guys.  I told a story I got to tell in front of you guys, too.  The lawyer, Maury Levy, or is that his name on the show?  Yeah.  That's getting all you guys off in court and stuff.  He's just a dirty lawyer.  I told Jimmy, I'm so convinced that that's really how he is in real life, that if he  came on our show, I would go right after him and maybe try to choke him out because I  hate the guy.  Michael is such a cool guy.  And that's what everyone says.  He's so nice.  I mean, really, really nice.  He's big into theater.  He has done the producers on the tour of the producers. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, he did the...  Yeah, exactly.  And wait till you see this guy.  He's like, oh, God, you just hate him instantly.  I know.  He's just a shady, shyster.  A nasty dude.  Smooth, too, as he's doing it.  He's a great lawyer and just the pity of a scumbag who knows his clients are filthy and  guilty and he doesn't care.  Which is the guy you want?  One of the first scenes I saw on the wire, it's the white Jewish lawyer and he's in court 
[02:33:00]  and he's slapping one of these badass gangsters, you know, drug dealer guys going, shut up.  Oh, he goes in and makes D'Angelo out of the thing.  He slaps him in the head.  He slaps him in the head.  He's talking.  And these guys are evil, evil people on the streets of Baltimore.  But this guy, they all know that this is the guy that is like, he's the badass.  He controls as they come or go.  Sure.  They got this, yeah, the D'Angelo was a drug dealer with a conscience and there was a guy  killed.  So the cops said, why don't you write a letter to this guy's family?  And, you know, dumb D'Angelo's like, that'd be a great idea. 
[02:33:30]  So he's sitting at the police station writing a letter of apology, even though he didn't  do it.  And the lawyer walks in and says, stop writing.  He just slaps his head.  He slaps his fucking head.  Oh, that's great.  And he carries him out like a five-year-old.  He grabs him and he goes, we're going.  And you know that he's a bad lawyer, though, when a drug dealer is slapped in the back of  the head and goes, all right, I'm sorry.  I totally forgot.  That was a hot seat.  By the way, we couldn't say this on the other side of the show, but it's coming in a lot  that you say shit better than anyone on TV.  Can you give us one? 
[02:34:00]  Never in my wildest dreams.  I mean, you know, it was like, it was just one of those things, you know, that you do  and next thing you know, it's like, I'm walking down the street and everybody's, can you just  do that for me?  Can you do it?  It's like, look, man, I got to go.  You know, I'm late for an appointment.  Just one time, one time.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course, Senator Clay Davis from The Wire, played by Isaiah Whitlock, Jr.  It's when you do it, because I had an uncle who used to do that like 20 times a day. 
[02:34:30]  It was comical.  I mean, it was like you get up in the morning and say, hey, Uncle Leon, did you sleep well?  Shit, man, my hand hit that pillow.  How'd you like dinner?  No, man, shit, them pork chops were good, man.  You know, it's like, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what I'm doing around my place, my fiancee, it's driving her nuts, but she asked  me a question, I go, fo-cho.  Fo-cho. 
[02:35:00]  Driving her nuts with my Omar impression.  Fo-cho.  She's like, you're just a white douche.  You're a white douche.  Why are you saying that?  And we're obsessed over the line in court when he's, you know, he's throwing bird under  the bus, and you see the defendant in court, yo, what up, bird?  I went on YouTube again and just watched it, his little, like, nod to him, and bird is  the most frightening-looking guy they got in the series.  Unfortunately, he went away in the first season, because there's never been a more awful-looking  fucking guy ready to shoot you than that guy. 
[02:35:30]  Wee-bay was the scariest for me so far.  Yeah, he's not a pleasant guy.  No, wee-bay's scary.  Oh, yeah, he took a lot of bodies at the end just for some fucking, for an extra sandwich  in the season one.  Oh, explain it to Anthony, yeah.  He's just taking credit for all these, because he knows he's going, so he's like, he's trying  to wrap up a little drug dealer, he's just taking credit for all these hits, just to,  I think, take the heat off of other people, just to, like, take the credit for help the  police department, you don't give a shit, but he was negotiating before he gave up  more murders.  Yeah, he was like, well, what did he want, like, another pork sandwich? 
[02:36:00]  He goes, you give me, oh, shit.  He didn't care at that point.  Yeah.  He wanted a sandwich and a soda to continue signing murder confessions.  These guys are great.  You can't not fucking like these dudes, man.  It's like...  Oh, by the way, Isaiah, they're both in plays, too, so I want to, I want to, Isaiah's  in a play called Unconditioned.  It's on Lafayette Naster, it's called The Public is the name of the theater, and the guy  that plays Rawls is also in the play, too. 
[02:36:30]  Is also in the play, yeah.  Yeah, it's very good, very good.  Okay, what is it about?  It deals with a lot of racial issues, interracial marriage, loneliness, all the dark things about  living in the city of New York.  Okay, great.  And they're going to play called Lower Ninth?  Yes.  And it's the Flea Theater on 41 White Street.  Where's that?  That's right.  Lower Manhattan between Broadway and Church Street.  Who do you play in that? 
[02:37:00]  I play Lowboy.  You can check it out, theflea.org.  It's about 24 hours after Katrina hit.  Oh, okay.  James McDaniels and Gaius Charles as well.  The play's good.  It's really good.  Come check it out.  It's like an hour and 10 minutes of great theater at the Flea Theater.  You guys don't do a whole lot of light stuff, do you?  No, you know.  Katrina, interracial marriage and loneliness.  How about a comedy?  How about a comedy?  Exactly.  How about a less romantic comedy or something?  How about a buddy flick?  How about a Sandra Bullock movie or something? 
[02:37:30]  Hey, break it up.  Break it up.  You got some dirty work.  Call me, man.  Do a black, white cop flick, you know?  Yeah, something fun.  Some sort of procedural.  We got to get along with each other.  That's one of the beauty of this show.  There's just none of that shitty cop dialogue they have.  You know, like...  The procedures.  Yeah, they're just drunks.  They all beat suspects.  And, you know, it's across the board.  They're all just cops.  There's none of that hacky cop shit, you see.  Yeah.  With hacky cop dialogue.  No, the cops are all believable. 
[02:38:00]  On this show, no one is all good or all bad.  Right.  Even, you know, the sociopathic killers and the cops,  they're all trying to do the best they can in the world that they have.  I mean, however fucked up it is.  You know, McNulty is a great example of it.  This dude, like, he breaks the law.  He's destroying himself and other people around him  in order to do something that he thinks is right.  You know, now, has he crossed the line?  Yeah.  Is he right to do it?  Maybe not.  You know, it brings up all types of questions in you  while you watch this show. 
[02:38:30]  Now, you guys, are you based out of New York?  Where are you guys based out of?  Yeah.  New York City.  Oh, you've all...  Okay.  Yeah.  And so is Andre, and I think Michael Williams is in New York, right?  Yeah.  Fucking great.  A bunch of hardcore theater in New York actors,  and they don't nominate it for Emmys.  The fucking Emmys should just have Ryerson sprinkled on the table  so I don't have a bunch of assholes.  Unless, of course, I've ever nominated for one.  I don't know if that stats you like the fucking irrelevant whore that I am.  Fuck the wire.  You do well in L.A., my friend. 
[02:39:00]  The thing is, though, you know, I always say, you know, they can do what they want.  You know, I'm still going to try to do good work  and just kind of let the chips fall where they may.  Yeah, I mean, you can't control it,  but it's just when you see good stuff not being rewarded.  I mean, how many years do we have to tolerate at the Oscars  just people not getting what they deserve?  It's, like, frustrating.  It's supposed to represent the best, and you're like,  this, you know, House might be a great show.  House might be fantastic.  But I don't know.  It doesn't do much for me.  No, not for me either. 
[02:39:30]  I want to go a little obscure.  I'm looking at Isaiah Whitlock Jr.'s bio here,  and I see that you had a part in Goodfellas.  Yes, I did.  Wow, I love Goodfellas.  That's one of our favorites.  Yeah, yeah.  One of Anthony's favorites especially.  Who did you play?  I don't remember.  Wait, will we try to guess?  Will we be able to guess or no?  If you didn't blink, is it one of those?  Well, yeah, it might be.  But it's interesting because there's a scene right at the end of the movie  where he goes to pick up his brother at the hospital. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, yes.  And he, yeah, so, you know, you might do two blinks there.  Yeah.  But he goes to pick up his brother at the hospital,  and he's been strung out on coke.  Paranoid with the alcohol.  Yeah, and he's very, very paranoid.  And the only guy in that one particular moment that he trusts  is this doctor at the hospital.  And I check him out, and I give him more volume and everything.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I send him on his way.  I remember that.  And what's interesting about that is, I'll never forget, 
[02:40:30]  I went into audition, and I had done the reading for The Color of Money  at Paul Newman's apartment.  And there was Tom Cruise and Martin Scorsese,  and we were all sitting around on the couch reading the script.  And, of course, I was hoping, you know, God, you know,  I just got to get in this movie, got to get in this movie.  Well, I never did, and I was so disappointed.  But when I went in to audition for Goodfellas, 
[02:41:00]  Martin Scorsese kind of looked at me, and he said,  I know you from somewhere.  I said, yeah, you know, I did those readings for you  at Paul Newman's apartment.  He said, oh, yeah, yeah, right.  I thought you were wonderful.  He says, well, look, you know, don't have to read or anything like that.  You know, I like your work, and I'll just see you on set.  Oh.  And I thought, you know, and the casting director,  I can't remember her name, but she was such a bitch.  You know?  And she was saying, now, look, when you go in and you see Marty, 
[02:41:30]  make sure that you do this and you do that.  And then when Marty, when I walked in to see Marty,  and Marty and I were, like, best of buds,  she walked out and said, well, you never told me you knew Marty.  I said, you know, I'm going to go back in there and tell Marty  what a bitch you are, and I'm going to have your ass fired.  What did you audition?  Wouldn't it be funny if you came in and all we wanted to talk about  was Goodfellas?  Yeah, yeah, no, The Wire's good, but tell us about Ray Liotta.  How tall is he? 
[02:42:00]  That's a great film, though.  You know, well, you know, it was just great to be a part of it,  you know, but that was, like, the real sort of trivia thing,  you know, where I could always say, you know, look, I was in Goodfellas.  Yeah, that's a biggie, man.  You may not even recognize me because I look like I'm about 12 years old,  you know.  We had a guy that called up once.  We were looking for people that had bit parts that were just listening to the show,  and some guy called up, and he was the guy that was standing in the driveway  when his buddy got his nose caved in by the gun. 
[02:42:30]  Oh, yes.  He was the guy that went, don't shoot.  Don't shoot.  That's what I'm like, wow, you had a line two and everything.  That guy's a fan of our show.  And to us, that's kind of cool.  Yeah, because I'm just like, you were Goodfellas, dude.  I didn't care if it was two seconds ago.  Don't shoot.  You remember that part, though.  Don't shoot.  Don't shoot.  Oh, he beat that motherfucker down, man.  Don't you ever do it.  A good fucking, a good pistol whipping to the bridge of the nose.  Yeah. 
[02:43:00]  You're right at it.  Oh, my goodness.  That's what you get for touching Karen.  Yeah, really.  And, Bengu, you got into acting because, what, you had a nine-to-five job or something like that?  And you just said, fuck this?  I used to work for the federal government.  And, I mean, I dug it.  What I was doing, I worked for the Corporation for National Service.  And it's the headquarters of AmeriCorps and Vista social service programs.  And I worked in the Congressional Affairs Department.  Wow.  And I just got curious about acting.  I didn't even really want to pursue it.  I just got curious about it.  Started researching it online, bought some books.  And I saw what actors did.  I started going on auditions. 
[02:43:30]  Just because the information was there,  I still wasn't trying to leave my job.  And then I got called from the Shakespeare Theater.  And they offered me a role.  And I kind of freaked out.  And I hung up the phone real quick.  And I'm like, I'll call you back.  And I hung up.  And then, like, five seconds later,  my uncle called and told me my father died.  And that was just like,  I went into my supervisor's office and resigned.  It was just like a sign that I had to go.  And I've been acting since how many years now?  What's this?  2008? 
[02:44:00]  So seven years?  It was 2001.  Wow.  Damn.  I wonder if they resent the fact at the Emmys that so many,  because a couple of you guys have been not around for many years.  Like, Tristan's very new.  And you're doing such great work.  And not having, you know,  been through 25 years of awful projects  like so many of them have been before.  You know what I mean?  Maybe that's kind of a resentment from Hollywood, too.  You know, that's there in the industry.  If you're, I'm not saying the Emmys are.  I'm just saying, in general, if you're bitter  and if you had to do all kinds of things, 
[02:44:30]  you put that resentment out subconsciously or however.  You know, it goes out there.  You know, you're in this industry.  You see how people, you're experiencing a lot of success.  And there's a lot of comedians who aren't experiencing your success  who have been out there a lot longer than you have.  Yeah.  You know, and you feel it in the way they greet you.  You know?  That's right.  The way they say congratulations.  Like when I put my hand out for the ring to be kissed.  It kind of bothers them a little bit.  You're changing, man.  Not me, man.  I always say, fuck it.  I got mine, you know? 
[02:45:00]  You know?  That's all I'm going to worry about.  I got my part.  You know?  I don't care how many,  I don't care if you've been here two days.  I got mine, you know?  And that's all I'm going to be concerned about, you know?  Wade, holy shit.  I knew I knew you.  And like I said, I'm fresh to the wire.  I'm only two seasons in,  so I'm going to be introduced to you in season three.  You were in The Savages I just read.  Yeah, did you see the movie?  I actually saw that movie.  No, but that movie, no one really saw it.  I mean, let's be honest.  It's a great movie.  The critics loved it.  Yeah, the critics loved it.  And it was nominated for a bunch of Oscars. 
[02:45:30]  Me and my girl, we were looking for a movie.  And we went to the Archie Theater and we saw it.  And it was downright fucking depressing, man.  But it was a good story.  And you played like an orderly or something at the home, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Looked up for Philip Bosco.  Holy shit, yeah.  And with this thing with Laura Linney.  You were like Jamaican or something.  No, she thought I was, Laura thought I was Jamaican.  And we had the whole scene at the end.  I'm like, I'm actually Nigerian.  And she's like, oh.  Were you guys smoking pot together or something?  No, we were smoking cigarettes. 
[02:46:00]  Cigarettes, right.  And it's funny because I don't smoke.  And Philip on set, Philip Hoffman had to teach me how to smoke.  Well, had to teach me how to look like I was smoking.  And yeah, like Laura and I have a lot of great scenes together.  And where she kind of misconstrues it and kind of goes for it.  Yeah.  And I have to reluctantly let her down, you know, which was great, of course.  I don't know if I can recommend the movie.  It was definitely a good movie.  Depressing as hell.  It's based on like some adult kids having to put their father into a home in Buffalo of all places. 
[02:46:30]  And every scene was pretty much gray.  But Laura Linney, Linney, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, he had scenes with Laura Linney, who's pretty damn huge.  Please tell me you got to shoot at least one person in the hall.  That should be his thing.  He has to, I have to kill one person.  That's what I do.  Rewrite.  They're old anyway.  Come on.  Well, Chris was not his first character on The Wire.  We all remember the cameo, which I learned from watching that Wire Odyssey special. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  He played, you didn't have a line, I don't think.  He was an extra.  He was a cop.  In where?  In one of the earlier.  Oh, wow.  That's so odd when that happens, you know?  I was actually twice.  I was an extra in the pilot background.  You don't even see me.  Like, way, background?  I was way, way background in the pilot episode.  And then, like you said, I was an extra in a courtroom.  And I'm bald.  My face is all clean.  And you don't even recognize.  It's wild.  It's wild.  Yeah, they circled it. 
[02:47:30]  There's a special on-demand called The Wire Odyssey.  Or whatever it is about, like, all the seasons.  And they kind of focus on that and stop.  You know, like, how funny would it be if, like, when you were on there, all the message  boards exposed.  But that's the cop from season one.  I don't believe that.  Well, you know, when I first auditioned, I auditioned for Lester Freeman.  Did you really?  I can see that.  You know, and then I think I went in for somebody else.  I think it was just Lester Freeman that I went in for. 
[02:48:00]  Do you guys, when you audition for a part and then you don't get it and somebody else  gets it and you get to another part, do you kind of watch them doing something and go,  ah, that's not the way I would have done it?  Or are you always looking at Lester's dialogue?  How would I say this?  No, I don't do that.  No, what's meant to be yours will be, I was originally cast as Slim Charles.  Like, they offered me the role.  Okay.  Who I love.  He was underused in season four.  You know, and.  Did they really?  Yeah, I was originally Slim Charles.  And I ended up turning that down because it conflicted with something else.  And then later on, I was like, man, maybe I shouldn't.  Because I didn't have anything better going on. 
[02:48:30]  And I was like, maybe I shouldn't have turned down that role on HBO.  And I didn't have anything at that point, you know.  And then some time passed and they called me up and they offered me Chris.  They said, you know, the writers, they really like you.  They want to offer you this role.  And I took it.  And I'm very glad that I took Chris.  You know, things happen for a reason.  And when other people get roles, you can't, you definitely can't kick yourself  because that wasn't supposed to be yours, you know.  Yours is something else.  The way I feel right now, I don't want to play anybody else but Clay Davis. 
[02:49:00]  I mean, you know, I mean, you know.  Chris should have his own movie.  I'd steal all the money.  Where do you come up with the anger that it takes to, like, the description of that beatdown  is just amazing.  Like, where, because you're a nice enough guy sitting here and stuff.  Where do you get that?  It's not hard for a black man to find rage.  No, it is.  You want to see rage coming out to the public theater.  Unconditional. 
[02:49:30]  I'm hanging people in the show, you know.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I am.  I'm nice.  Holy shit.  Like I said, it's not hard for a black man to find Rays in America.  Well, now that he opened the door a little bit, I was a little too scared to ask.  But it's down on the sheet that he got in a lot of trouble as a youth, so.  Oh, yeah.  And you changed your life around.  I was in and out of schools, homeschooling, I mean, all kinds of stuff.  Like, it was an interesting time growing up.  Interesting.  You grew up where in New York?  No, I grew up in Maryland, like 40 minutes south of Baltimore.  And, yeah, we were in and out of schools, in and out of different homes. 
[02:50:00]  I mean, it was, yeah, I got in a lot of trouble.  And it wasn't until I started wrestling my junior year, like, I had to earn my way into  a regular high school first.  And then when I started wrestling my junior year, that I was able to stay in that high school.  So, and I got a wrestling scholarship the next year.  I was fortunate that I took to it, and I was very good at it.  I still wrestle, actually, when I can.  For who?  I did a tournament about...  For Vince McMahon?  For Vince McMahon.  No, not for Vince. 
[02:50:30]  That would be a great new character where you just, you pull a pistol and murder every  opponent in the ring.  And after, like, three weeks, people are like, we don't want to see this guy anymore.  But you can't wrestle here.  You can't wrestle here.  But the beauty of a Vince storyline, no one really figures it out.  He's still on the wrestling card every week.  Of course.  Of course.  We do a Wire WrestleMania, you know?  All the characters on the Wire will be taking on some of these guys.  I'll be a better cause.  Yeah.  Top group.  I want to go see these plays, man. 
[02:51:00]  Like, I don't go to see a lot of theater.  Come check it out.  The Flea Theater, Lower Ninth.  It's running right now.  The show is really good.  It's got James McDaniels, who is Lieutenant Fancy from NYPD Blue.  Gaius Charles, who's smashed Williams on Friday Night Lights.  And of course, myself, Bengai Kinebe.  It's at 41 White Street, south of Canal.  The Flea Theater.  Theflea.org.  It's not one where Jimmy would be sitting there and at the end of the show everyone goes,  There's one of the motherfuckers.  You know, you sit and go, man, I'm just here to see the fucking play.  No, no, no, it's your fault. 
[02:51:30]  I'm just a patron.  The kid I went for.  I would love to go, but I tend to do this during plays.  Like, during a scene when you're doing it, I tend to stand up and go, I know him.  Like, a lot of people have found that distracting, but I mean, a lot of people just kind of go with it.  We improv a little.  You know it's about me.  Why is a senator in a play?  Say shit, please.  You know, people in theaters, a lot of elderly people go and see theater, and it's wild because  they don't necessarily know their own voices sometimes, especially if they have hearing aids. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, damn.  Like, I've been in theaters where people, they'll talk to the person next to them.  That person's a bad actor.  Oh, shit.  Like, real loud.  It's like, I think this scene is over.  I mean, just, and they're like, the daughter's like, shh.  It's crazy.  It's so funny to see.  Quiet, Grandma.  You don't know their means so loud.  It's funny to see, unless you're the actor they're talking about.  It's like, would somebody smother her, please, on a fucking pillow?  Yeah.  It's not you. 
[02:52:30]  You're like, God, we've been saying the same thing backstage.  Since this thing started, thank God.  It's not just us.  You know what?  It's like when I was shooting Spider-Man.  Oh, right, right.  Oh, of course.  You were in the blockbuster movie Spider-Man.  Yeah, I mean, good fellow Spider-Man.  I remember.  You were in Spider-Man?  Well, you know.  He was surly truck driver.  Yeah, I am.  Number one, I believe.  I heard the residuals on there are hot, though.  Yeah.  Fucking, I probably made about eight grand off one line.  See?  I heard the residuals are hot.  Wow. 
[02:53:00]  I know somebody else who had, like, one line in that movie, and they were getting sick  residuals.  I got $1,000, which was higher than, for, I don't know, five and under.  It was $1,000 just to, I did, I said, he stinks, and I don't like him.  And that was the line.  And I just keep getting, I get a lot of checks.  That movie, it's running well.  It's, you know, doing well internationally.  It did well internationally.  Yeah, that's a huge one.  You know, yeah.  Let's get him another royalty check.  Here it is.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Yeah, you know, I had to emote someone right there, in the flesh, right there. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, you know how it is when you have to put something out there.  You beat people to death, and I just do it both.  I wish I could put that beating on audio.  It's unfortunate that there's no, except for the dull son of flesh, there's no way to say  that.  That'd be interesting to hear, the lead up to it, because we walk into it, we're talking,  it's like, I'm like, you like touching boys?  It's like, nah, nah, nah.  And it's like, you know, we're in prison, you gotta do what you gotta do.  I'm like, yeah, I understand.  I mean, it'd be interesting to hear that.  Wow.  And not see it.  You fucking savage ham.  I still have a hard time watching that scene, actually. 
[02:54:00]  Wow, really?  I was over at some friend's house, and they tried to show it to me, like, just about a  month or two ago.  And I started watching it, and then I was like, I have to leave the room right now.  Damn.  Guys were coming up to me on the street saying, yo, what's wrong with Chris?  I think you need to go ask Chris.  And the funniest line, I wish we had the audio, because the way Steve goes, damn, you didn't  even wait until the motherfucker got in the house.  Like, of all the things she could have said, it was, gee whiz, couldn't you be patient? 
[02:54:30]  Or the one guy who didn't want to be put in the house because his people wouldn't find  him.  And there were, he said, there's rats in there.  And I went to say, dude, they're going to kill you.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  Oh, was that the guy who, who, uh...  Ope Sondre.  That was the guy who, uh, he said, you're not, Omar said, you're not Delta Airlines either?  That was the guy who took his ring?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  He had to go.  He had to go.  He had to go, huh?  Yeah, Marlo had to fucking, took his ring and, uh, that guy had to go. 
[02:55:00]  You knew he wasn't going to be fucking, uh...  I think we actually have the audio of them talking.  Do we have that?  Which one?  Uh, it's Marlo talking, uh, Chris is in the scene, but he's in the, I'm sorry, I beg,  he's in the scene, he's in the background.  I'm going to call you Chris, you're a fucking idiot.  That's all right.  Um, uh, it's, it's Marlo, this guy, this guy was robbed by Omar, and he owes money to  Marlo.  And he's trying to explain that Omar's a terrorist, and you know how it is.  He robbed me.  And Marlo is basically...  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah, he's using the example, like, the, the government, like, forgave a lot of debts, 
[02:55:30]  or they put a lot of debts on hold because of the terrorists and Delta Airlines or whatever.  So he's trying to say, you know, that's what's going on.  I was, I was robbed and everything, you know, even the government...  Oh, shit, you ain't dead Delta Airlines.  It's not in there, is it?  Oh, man.  Yeah, he went there.  That's a great line.  You know, these are all Omar, this is a Marlo film.  Yeah, yeah, we're trying to find it, we'll find it.  Yeah, it's just a really, uh, a really cool clip, and you know, that guy wound up in the  house.  I wish there was a way to play that dull thud.  It's such, on a break, I'll show one of you, any one of you guys want to watch it. 
[02:56:00]  I know you don't want to get to that point yet, but you guys...  Yeah, I know.  I'm just, I'm just waiting for one of these guys to show emotion on this show.  Just one time.  Show emotion from the horrific crap that is going on.  With the kids, man.  Yeah.  The kids.  Oh, that'll bleed you emotionally.  Right on.  It's so good.  And what's wild is that, as horrific as things are on the show, as far as the grittiness of  it, it's not near the reality.  It's even worse than reality.  I've been in these schools in Baltimore, I've talked to these teachers and these kids, 
[02:56:30]  and, like, it's worse in real life.  Some of the stories, they could show it on HBO, some of the things that they did in these  schools.  There's a great face slashing in season four, too, with this dude.  It's one girl, like an ugly girl, who's getting teased.  No, it's okay.  Just a quick scene.  La, la, la, la.  She's got some sort of problem.  Yeah, and she's getting teased by a prettier girl, and boy, she gives her a face slashing.  I mean, look, after being in some of these public schools, you could see it coming, you  know?  The minute they put that camera on, I said, look, don't fuck with her, please. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, God, please don't.  I've seen this before.  I know what happens when you deal with a person like that.  Can't you see she's a fucking problem?  She's sitting there twitching silently.  Anybody twitching, you don't fuck with her, man.  She's a broke, ugly, fat girl.  Don't fuck with her.  She's only going to slice your face.  She does.  She's got Vaseline on her face and stuff like that. 
[02:57:30]  You don't want to mess with her.  She's got cold cream on you.  And she's in middle school.  Oh, shit.  I just recognized Isaiah.  Where?  From something else.  What?  No.  Dad got hosed.  That commercial.  Isaiah's in a lot of commercials.  I know, I know, man.  Dad got hosed.  Verizon, right?  Yeah, I try to sneak in and sneak out, but it just doesn't seem that same to happen. 
[02:58:00]  We lose you.  You got a lot of catchphrases.  What was really bad was I was walking down the street one day, and I started at one block.  It was like, she.  And by the time I got to the end, it was like, Dad got hosed.  And I thought, oh, God, I'm just going to lose my fucking mind.  We're all about catchphrases on the show.  I'm going to be afraid to talk after a while, you know?  That was, was this guy who has the campaign now, was he, can you hear me now? 
[02:58:30]  Can you hear me now?  Was this during this campaign?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  But you know what's really interesting is when you actually meet him, like, like the, because  you see him everywhere.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden, you meet him, and it's like, I'm here with the tech man.  It's like, he's the guy.  Yeah.  The most famous guy in the world.  Yeah.  Does he have an attitude about him, or is he down to earth?  No, he's really down to earth.  I hope he's well compensated, because his image is everywhere, and he can't do anything else. 
[02:59:00]  He's a really nice guy, and he came up to me, you know, in the tech thing with the glasses,  and he says, Isaiah, right?  I said, yeah, man.  He says, we've got some mutual friends.  We do.  We do?  Oh, my God.  You know, my heart started beating, you know?  Who do I know in the tech world?  But no.  But it turned out that he, I mean, he's an actor, and he knows a lot of people that I know.  How much money is he making?  That fucking Verizon, how much money is he pulling?  I've never gotten a commercial in my life. 
[02:59:30]  It's going to be a couple Gs.  Perhaps more than that old.  How many years has it been?  Oh, years.  How much do you think he is pulling?  I've never landed a commercial in my life.  I'm not quite sure.  We took a, he's got like a Learjet that we took down to.  I'll tell you an interesting story about that, that I heard.  I cannot verify that it's true.  Let me just say that out there.  And I probably shouldn't tell this story, but I am.  Yeah, tell us.  Why not?  I heard that.  I'm the new tech guy. 
[03:00:00]  I'm the new tech guy.  So he's in Taiwan with children.  And he kept his glasses off.  No.  I heard when he signed the deal, like Verizon, like his agent calls up, like they're making  their deal, whatever.  And I don't know who his agent is, and I'm not, I don't know, and he calls up and says,  he's not taking any less than this amount.  And Verizon's like, okay.  And they signed the deal and so on.  Apparently they agreed to it so quick because they were willing to offer him so much more. 
[03:00:30]  Like he had, yeah, yeah, yeah, he got a host.  Oh, yeah, right.  But I don't know if it's true.  If it's not true, I apologize.  I just heard, and that's an interesting story to spread anyway.  Yeah.  So now it's out there and it's back.  Oh, that's funny.  So Dumbbell agent tried to play a hardball and cost that client about $4 million.  His agent's Ralph Cramden.  He doesn't take any less than $500 a week.  Don't worry.  I got a good deal for you, Noah.  I went back to HBO and tried to get a signing bonus. 
[03:01:00]  My agent slapped me over the head like Levy did.  What are you, crazy?  Yeah, right.  I want a signing once.  Are you in the NFL now?  Yeah, right.  I want a $50,000 signing bonus.  It's like, whack.  Let's go.  You're out of here now.  They'd only give me $20.  We should get these guys out of here.  That's correct, man.  We really appreciate you guys coming over to XM with us.  Oh, hell yeah.  Thank you.  It's been a lot of fun.  Thank you.  I think you can figure out that we're pretty big fans of the show. 
[03:01:30]  Thanks for watching the show and supporting us, having us on.  Fantastic, man.  The season finale is Sunday night, 9 o'clock.  Hour and a half or so, right?  90 minutes.  So if you're taping and DVRing, make sure you...  Oh, well, no.  It'll just...  What am I saying?  What do you think it is?  An old VCR?  I know, I know.  I pushed record, but I only had an hour.  And put the end off.  And you guys want to plug the plays too?  Give them one more plug just so people know they want to come see you live to a real theater  here in New York City.  Come see Unconditional with the Labyrinth Theater performing at The Public. 
[03:02:00]  I'll be there.  Isaiah Woodlock Jr. with John Doman, who plays Rawls on The Wire.  It's a great show.  Come and check it out.  We run until Sunday.  We close on Sunday.  So come fast.  You better get down there early.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come down to The Flea Theater.  You can check it out at theflea.org, as in the insect.  And come watch me, Ben Guy, Keenabe, James McDaniels, and Gaius Charles in Lower Ninth.  We run until April 5th.  It's a great play.  Running time in about one hour, 15 minutes. 
[03:02:30]  Check it out.  Oh, that's good.  That's a good time for a play.  Yeah, in and out.  I like that.  I like a roll over an hour.  I'm good.  Yeah.  Whenever there's an intermission, I've never seen the second half of a play.  I just can't go back in.  But this one, you like.  It's like, no intermission.  Just hit it.  We knock it out.  Let's just get it done.  Exactly.  It's not a play when the fucking little sliding thing comes over the glass and you see a naked  girl on the other side, Jimmy.  And you got to keep putting them in quarters?  Yeah.  That's not a play.  It's not theater.  We do have an intermission, but still come.  Sorry. 
[03:03:00]  The intermission is fine.  Sorry.  That explains a lot, though.  It's like, wait a minute, man.  You guys are like ruining my show, man.  I mean, what's going on?  I'm going to make the second act.  I always cum in the first one.  Not intermission.  The five is a good play.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  We got to take a break.  Not us.  They're getting out of here.  Thanks a lot, guys.  The Wire, Sunday night, 9.30.  9 o'clock.  Very cool.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you, man.  All I want is to get laid in these sandwiches.  That's it.  That's the closest reference you can get to something cool, hip, and groovy. 
[03:03:30]  Cool, hip, and groovy.  Dick.  Yeah.  Where do you go when your wife changes the locks?  The Opi and Anthony Show.  I want to be on you.  Well, you've come to the great place.  I help you.  You help me.  We all laugh.  Don't worry.  We're not listening because this is a boring conversation.  I love you too, sweetness.  You walk past them.  They'll take your jewelry.  They'll take your purse or whatever, you know.  You have no idea what they are.  There are a lot of questions about them.  Real.  Dirty looking.  Pinky knife.  Shut up.  Bring on the booze.  Is this the Opi and Anthony Show?  Okay. 
[03:04:00]  Okay.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[03:04:30]  Ha, ha, ha. 
[03:05:00]  Get Stupid Flea in here for a minute.  Look at him.  Why do I have to leave?  I'm just, all I'm doing is hanging out.  Flea, come here.  Flea just handed me a letter in the middle of the show.  We're attempting to do a radio show.  Why is...  Something's feeding back.  I think it's one of these mics, maybe.  I think it's headphones or something.  Ha.  Or something.  Flea.  There you go.  What's up?  He showed me the same stupid letter.  Dude, there's this controversy going on with the fans of the fine radio show. 
[03:05:30]  And there's a lot of people pissed off because we did a quick animation contest with K-Rock  here in New York City.  And after two weeks, we announced the winner.  And there's outrage because the winning animation was done by an animation house, basically.  Yeah.  And why do we care about that, Flea?  Why don't you speak for the people out there?  Well, shouldn't it mainly be for people who are doing it individually rather than people  who would be possibly doing it on their job?  It just doesn't seem like a fair contest if you're having people who do it professionally, 
[03:06:00]  especially when it's five people.  It's not just one person.  Flea, let's say you are part of a show called Flea and Anthony.  Ugh, I quit.  Or Opian Flea.  There you go.  Why would that be good for the radio show to blow off professionals?  Well, it's not a bad idea.  Because in the end, this animation thing is very entertaining for us, very entertaining  for the listeners.  And the better quality work means that this stuff will spread further than the ONA community,  which could only help the radio show in the end.  But it's also saying to the people who are doing it by themselves, not who are being paid 
[03:06:30]  on the job.  What's it saying to them?  What's it saying to them?  Like CokeLogic who does it by himself.  Right, but CokeLogic is doing it on his spare time.  Yeah, but CokeLogic...  So I'm saying that professionals get the same thing as non-professionals.  CokeLogic is very low respect.  Yeah, CokeLogic should be working for one of these animation houses at this point.  I don't know what he does for a living, but he should really blow that off and start  doing this full time.  Secondly, this girl, Andrea, you gave everybody this letter, which pisses me off. 
[03:07:00]  Well...  She's getting a lot of exposure for her work.  Don't you get it?  That video is on YouTube.  It's getting a lot of views.  It's on all our websites.  There's a beauty to that, too.  Yeah, but the reason I'm saying it, and you brought up CokeLogic.  Imagine if CokeLogic had five people and he worked for Disney.  That'd be awesome.  And they do an Opie and Anthony video?  Yeah, we don't want Disney animation doing an Opie and Anthony video.  Imagine Pixar throwing together.  That would be awful for the show.  You're right, Flea.  That would suck for us, Flea.  No, I'd rather have some freshman in college do the animation. 
[03:07:30]  You're right.  It doesn't make sense.  I think it makes sense.  No, it doesn't make sense, because Andrea still gets exposure in the end.  She did a great animation on her own.  Absolutely.  For the coin cleavage contest, you could have five girls with large double Ds instead of  one girl who comes in.  Yes, you could have either one.  So should we say only real tits?  No, but what do you understand?  New Names, the only animation.  No, I don't know what you mean.  Hold on.  That's called New Names.  Already 9,100 views on YouTube. 
[03:08:00]  Now, if it wasn't for this show, this animation by Andrea would have been seen by nobody.  By nobody.  She got something out of it.  And it was a competition.  I don't believe it was said you can enter or not enter, right?  Yeah, if Pixar and Disney wants to get involved, because we are going to be doing this huge  animation festival, holy shit, we'd be jumping up and down for joy.  And the people that attend the event will be very happy at what they say.  You kidding me?  So the karaoke contest we had for Mac, we didn't say that people couldn't be in a band  or couldn't be professionals. 
[03:08:30]  You know what I mean?  We had some that were awful.  What?  Well, I agree with that.  But also, if you had a professional band come in and do karaoke, and then somebody who's  doing it by themselves do it, it just wouldn't be fair.  The difference between a professional band coming in and doing karaoke and submitting  it the way these were submitted, because we're not watching it.  We're only seeing the finished result.  There's a difference between that.  I'm just getting a little communique here from Marissa.  Tell Flea to shut the fuck up.  Who's Marissa? 
[03:09:00]  Probably representing everybody that knows you.  Oh, okay.  So why are you taking up for this girl when it's obvious that nothing wrong was done?  Well, I'm not.  She just asked me to, you know...  But why would she ask you thinking that you would do it?  Dude, I'd be flattered.  Plus the fact, like, she's got to understand the big game.  A lot of these people have to understand the big game.  I had a long talk with Steven S. from Bayshore.  I'm like, dude, you're a brilliant writer, and you're going to get discovered because  of your show rundowns.  He's making no money because they forgot to pay him, and when they do pay him, it's  only going to be about $100 a week. 
[03:09:30]  But if you look at the long, long-term plan here, it's going to lead to something.  And I say the same thing to Andrea that did New Names Animation.  Now she's got something pretty goddamn cool to put on a fucking resume if she wants to pursue  this career further.  All right.  I'm just...  I don't know what else you want me to say.  This is my animation.  I just decided to give it to you, and I didn't want...  I didn't even know it was going to be brought up on the show.  But you're taking up for her.  You didn't know it was going to be brought up on the show.  You wanted it to be brought up on the show.  No, I didn't.  How many people got this letter?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. 
[03:10:00]  Seven in this room.  You didn't want it brought up on the show.  Why are you handing out copies?  Because I just...  I wanted to hand it to you guys.  And also, you said you never check your email, so I just figured...  I don't.  I don't have an official email for this show.  Okay.  So I just wanted to...  Something we're looking into, because I think we should go back to that.  I gave it to you during the break, just so you could read, you know, on your spare time,  just like when I gave it to Anthony.  Spare time.  You said you read it on his spare time.  No, no, no, no.  Giving it to me to read on my spare time is like when I'm on the sidewalk walking home, 
[03:10:30]  so then there's no potential that I would bring it up on the air.  You're not a dumb kid.  You gave it to all of us, hoping that this was going to happen, that we would actually  discuss it.  And I see nothing wrong with it.  If animation houses or companies want to get involved with the real animation festival  that is officially on, then so fucking be it.  It's only good for everybody.  Now, listening to what Opius said, how can you counter that?  Like, here's a reasoning for what it will do for the radio show and things of that nature.  It's his animation contest.  It's your guy's animation contest. 
[03:11:00]  That's not what I'm saying.  I'm saying, but you didn't say that when you came in.  You had a point, like, I think it's wrong or it's better.  I didn't say it was wrong.  I just said it's dissatisfying.  No, that's wrong.  You're playing with semantics.  Dissatisfying?  It's dissatisfying for a small, extremely small group of ONA listeners.  And dissatisfying or wrong, that's a semantics game.  Yeah, and she, first of all, I'll be honest, I did vote for her to win the whole thing,  but everyone else voted as well.  So she lost, she came in second place, but everyone knows who she is now. 
[03:11:30]  And it was very good animation.  They absolutely could have won.  It doesn't matter where these things come from.  It matters how funny they are, how well put together they are.  It doesn't have to be a professional animation.  It just has to make us laugh.  Right.  That's all.  I've seen some professional stuff that's fucking utter shit.  She beat out some professional people, by the way.  She just didn't come in first.  She came in second.  So did you piss on your feet today?  No, not today.  He pisses on his feet.  Why? 
[03:12:00]  To make him soft.  Why?  Because he thinks there's something in piss that softens the skin.  Yeah, urea.  So he pisses on his feet.  What?  Urea.  And then on Pal Talk, he'll cross his legs and his disgusting yellow feet will show, because  they're fucking piss feet.  They're stained?  He's got piss feet.  Stained piss feet.  Well, urine is used for a lot of things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's true, though.  Urine does soften your skin.  Give me some urine facts.  Because they also have fucking, like, Vaseline intensive care lotion.  Yeah, that's about something else.  That's not about stopping your skin. 
[03:12:30]  Well, no, it's not something that you just, you know, kind of do standing in your room,  but like in the shower or something.  Why do you want soft feet?  You like the way it feels.  Why don't you just admit that?  If you want to soften your feet, you can put Vaseline on it like you just said.  Or some kind of, you know, cream or something.  But I'm also, you know, not, you know.  Why don't you just admit you like the way it feels?  The warm piss feel.  Why don't you just acknowledge to yourself.  Like warm piss on your feet.  You like that feeling.  That's what that's about.  I love the feel of warm piss on my skin.  You do?  I mean, for real.  You have to understand that.  No, it's just something that you can do in the shower that just, you know. 
[03:13:00]  All right, whatever.  Stop acting like you're being practical.  It is.  You're not pragmatic.  It's pragmatic.  Urine is actually good for your skin.  I know it is.  I'm sure it's terrific.  So are a million other products that you can rub without pissing on yourself.  Like a fucking chimpanzee.  You know what else is good for your hair?  Shit is good for your hair.  Right.  But there's shampoo.  Urine is good for your hair, by the way.  Come is good for your skin, too.  Yeah.  You know that?  Why don't you kneel in a booth and fucking, and have somebody fucking arc alone on your cheeks.  And then you rub it in and you say it so your smile has more luster. 
[03:13:30]  Let's do a bukkake on your feet.  What?  Bukkake?  Ziggy, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, I like how, according to Flea Man, this contest is for people with no friends and  no job.  Yeah.  Because, obviously, you know, we at this company, I'm from All Things Media, we made the winning  cartoon.  And, you know, we're all fans of the show.  We all listen while we work. 
[03:14:00]  And when we heard about this contest, we wanted to be part of it.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah, in the end, in the end, these guys are fans of the show, Flea.  Exactly.  That's great.  No friends and no job.  You're right.  Guess what?  This guy, Ziggy, if we do a karaoke contest for a Mac, that's not his expertise, so I  would imagine Ziggy's not going to go for that particular contest.  No, I would think at it.  Right.  But animation.  But animation.  Hey, this is right down my alley.  I'm a fan of the show.  Yeah, I'm going to give this a shot.  Why not?  Yeah, you know, we heard about, we're like, Adam, who submitted it, he was like, we should 
[03:14:30]  do this.  And everybody just was like, yeah, this is great, you know?  What's the problem?  And Flea Man's going on the message board, there was five people working on it.  Like, who cares?  Right.  They're all fans of the show.  You work on it with five people, and you do a good animation.  Right.  Hey, Zig, you guys working on one for the Real Festival?  Oh, absolutely.  All right, cool.  Right now, we're just trying to find a good bit to work with, you know?  Any bit works.  We just want, you can't make them, we're trying to keep them to two, three minutes at the most. 
[03:15:00]  Shorter is definitely better in this contest.  Oh, yeah.  Well, we figured that, you know?  Okay.  We just want to find a really good clip to work with.  Yeah, game on.  We're still looking for a venue, but we're doing the first annual, we want to try to do  this every year, Opie and Anthony Animation Festival, or we've got to come up with a  cooler name than that, but we've got at least $2,500, if not more.  We're trying to get the prize money up to 510Gs, other prizes, we're going to get comedians 
[03:15:30]  to perform in between the animations.  It's going to be a great night of entertainment.  And sorry, Flea, that we're going with professionals, but yeah, that's what we're doing.  All right, Zig, thank you.  Screw them.  If you can't take it, just screw them.  All right, cool, man.  Thanks.  All right, man.  All right.  Later.  All right.  Are you happy now that you'd like completely stopped the show with your nonsense?  I'm sorry.  I just wanted to hand it to you.  I didn't even think it would be brought up.  And you know, if that's your rules, it's your rules.  I'm not here to change the show. 
[03:16:00]  He's always got something to say that just is abrasive.  Oh, I know.  It's like, not just like, all right, well, you know, it's like this, you're abrasive.  You really are like kind of just.  He hears it all the time.  He knows it.  Yeah, yeah, people don't really, like they enjoy you around because they like making  fun of you, I think.  They abhor you as if you are a water bug.  You're just annoying. 
[03:16:30]  You can't be pleasant.  Your energy.  How do you get the frosted hair, by the way?  You allow people to piss on your hair?  Yeah.  That's fucking hairdo.  Dude, frost is out, bro.  Let me say something.  That's a hair don't.  Oh, good gravy.  Good gravy.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  There's no such thing as the first annual.  It's just the annual.  Absolutely.  Open Anthony, Cartoon Fest.  Until the second one. 
[03:17:00]  Cartoon Fest, the Palooza-ation.  Yeah.  What is the fucking kid with the Hawaiian punch hair going to fucking do?  That bugs me.  All right.  Well, Andrea, congratulations for coming in second.  I still think that's awesome, and I still think that's very good for you.  I think you should, you know, pursue that further, obviously.  Thanks for bringing it to our attention there, Flea.  Yes.  Anything else that's wrong?  Yeah, anything else?  I have my raging heart on right now.  I'm happy that they're working on their animations out there.  Do we have enough bits to choose from on the website? 
[03:17:30]  We were supposed to do that, and if you can find other audio, that's great, too.  Sort of?  No?  Anything?  Anyone?  What?  That's Steve's thing.  Oh, boy.  That means no.  Oh, boy.  That was a good passing of the buck.  Oh, boy.  Where's Than?  That son of a bitch.  I haven't seen him all day.  That fucking fruit's moving.  I didn't even notice he wasn't here.  It's kind of strange.  Oh, ouch.  Flea, what?  No, I asked...  Don't you know when it's over?  Jesus.  Right.  I just asked Sam if I could go. 
[03:18:00]  I'll just make a chore.  All right.  Just ask Sam if I could go.  I've got to go piss on my feet.  I want to thank Matthew for stopping in today.  Yuck.  Well, thank you for reading it, anyway.  Much appreciated.  I didn't even read it.  Flea, I didn't read it?  Oh, God.  Do you just hate him?  Why'd you throw up the devil horns on the way out?  Like there was fucking Dio staring at a fucking console.  No, I didn't.  I just...  What is that?  This isn't devil horns.  This is...  Instead of pointing like this, you just give, you know...  Why would you do that? 
[03:18:30]  I don't know.  It's the thumb and point...  It's the thumb and pinky...  Thumb and pinky.  Point it out in different directions.  Almost like a hang ten mahalo kind of a...  No, it's meant to...  It's the goodbye, you know?  It's not goodbye.  A wave is goodbye.  This is...  I'm a horse's ass.  Goodbye is you flying out that window.  That'd be a great goodbye.  Or a wave.  You're a chatter.  Thanks, Flee.  Plummet.  Now you guys can go discuss how you were on the show and how it's still wrong.  Blah, blah, blah.  No, it's your contest.  Jesus Christ.  There he goes.  No, it's your contest. 
[03:19:00]  Which means like...  I still...  I still completely think I'm right.  You're a dick.  But it's your contest.  I still...  I still disagree with what happened.  I still think...  It shouldn't be professionals.  Blind CC.  Blind CC.  I don't think professionals should be in there.  It should be just open to listeners.  Listeners.  I'm going to piss on my feet.  It's not really fair.  Hey, before you leave, you want to fucking hole up your lighter until we play Freebird?  Fucking bag of jism.  Why is he still here? 
[03:19:30]  I don't know.  Get out.  Let's go to Steve in Chicago.  Steve.  Yeah.  Good evening.  Hi, Steve.  How you doing?  Hey.  Am I on the show?  Yeah.  No, Steve.  Hey, how you guys doing, man?  I love the show, by the way.  Good comeback, Jim.  Hold on.  What did I say?  I didn't hear.  He goes, am I on the show?  And you go, no, Steve.  You're...  I'm sorry, boys. 
[03:20:00]  No, it was my fault.  I love it.  I just smoked a huge bowl of dro, so I loved it.  Oh, you like that?  Ah.  But anyway, what I wanted to say was I appreciate what you boys are doing for the animators here.  Yeah.  What are animators?  Animators.  I'm actually not much of an animator.  Like that Chicago accent, the Chicago hillbilly accent.  That's what that is.  But anyway, man, I just wanted to let you guys know, everybody in Chicago  was really filming the show, man.  I know at least 10 people that just bought XM Radio. 
[03:20:30]  Well, that's everybody if you're talking about Chicago.  10 people.  Everybody or 10.  Wow.  Well, that's all the people I know in any way.  You know, I'm like...  I love to hang up.  All right.  A couple of things we still need to do here.  We played this earlier on the clean side of the show, and we certainly want to do the  uncensored version for everybody today.  The dirty version.  Yeah.  We like the dirty, dirty, dirty version.  Dirty, dirty.  Do you remember when we played this?  Someone is suggesting, can we put Dice on Ice up on the website so you can animate that 
[03:21:00]  for the big animation festival?  Wow.  Any bit, if you can find it, will work.  Fair game.  It's fair game.  Go to audible.com.  I don't know.  We have some best of discs up there that have some fine bits, and I don't know.  But any bit.  So if you want to do Dice on Ice, I would love to see that animated.  Dice on Ice would be hysterical, animated.  I would assume in an animation festival, there'd be a bunch of dice animations that come in.  I would like to see the religious dice one, where he's walking down the beach and the 
[03:21:30]  footprints in the sand dice.  I like the hat.  Jesus, I'm over here now.  Dice.  And the hat one.  The hat down at Ground Zero, way past everybody else.  Oh, where he was going to have a thing.  A thing.  A teledown thing.  He was officially the last celebrity to go visit the boys down there.  Yeah, to visit and, you know, try to come up with a charity or something.  When did he go down?  Fuck.  I don't know.  2003?  2003?  Well, yeah.  Yeah, I'm here. 
[03:22:00]  All right, here we go.  From earlier.  We're live along Route 23 here in Pompton Plains, where the snow has been coming down  at a fairly steady clip for about an hour and a half now.  I'd say there's about an inch, an inch and a half on the ground you can see right here.  Maybe even a little more than two inches.  But take a look over here on the roadway.  Just in the last half hour or so, the flakes have begun to stick a little bit on the ass.  What?  Hey!  Hey!  What the fuck?  We sat through that and got a beep. 
[03:22:30]  We're live along Route 23 here in Pompton Plains, where the snow has been coming down at a fairly steady clip for about an hour and a half now.  I'd say there's about an inch, an inch and a half on the ground you can see right here.  Maybe even a little more than two inches.  But take a look over here on the roadway.  Just in the last half hour or so, the flakes have begun to stick a little bit on the asshole.  Asshole.  Now, if you actually compare that.  Ah, the flakes are sticking on the asshole. 
[03:23:00]  On the asshole.  Asshole asphalt!  Oh, I'm so fired!  Holy shit!  Oh, fuck!  This is exactly what Opie and Anthony talk about.  I'm not just fired.  I'm so fired.  Oh, I'm so fired.  Quantum Dice would be great in animation.  Which one is Quantum Dice?  Where he's jumping around, like, saving, like, little Jessica and just going through history and doing all the things a little too late.  I bet that was a big Sam Adams day for me.  I'm a little frustrated we don't have all the details yet, but it is going down. 
[03:23:30]  It is going to happen, hopefully, in May.  So, just to everybody that wants in on this thing, start animating and getting your shit together.  And we'll figure out the rest of this thing, okay?  Right.  All right, I mean...  Don't listen to stupid Flea.  No, no, no, not at all.  All right, we started this yesterday.  We should finish this today.  Spuds Buckley?  What?  What are you talking about?  I thought that's what you were going to do.  But we didn't start it yesterday.  Good morning, Batman.  Yeah, that was it.  Wait.  La, la, la, la, la. 
[03:24:00]  Good morning, Batman.  Good morning, Batman.  La, la, la, la, la, la.  Oh, no, no.  Good morning, Batman.  Oh, I got goosebumps of douche chills.  Holy fucking freezing.  Hey, man.  Oh, God.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Someone had to pave the way for this.  Wow.  This fucking dynasty.  Pave the fucking way.  You were macheteing through jungle.  That wasn't even paving yet. 
[03:24:30]  I don't know what the fuck that was.  La, la, la, la, la.  Wow.  You know something?  Yeah.  I got to give it to you, though.  That's bravery.  That's bravery.  Because that tape would have fucking ended up in the fireplace, and I would have went,  I couldn't find it, guys.  I just couldn't find it.  That's the beauty of our show.  Actually, someone else found it, so I knew I had to, like.  Oh, you had to.  They would have been like, hey, where's that Spuds Buckley tape I sent in to Opie?  I got a cassette filled with my great Super Bowl song I sang for everybody. 
[03:25:00]  As who?  As the Spuds Buckley tape.  Oh, no.  I had in one line of it.  Just one line.  Oh, no.  Look how embarrassing.  It's Super Bowl Sunday.  But I sung that.  But I sung that.  Wait, wait.  It's Super Bowl Sunday.  No, no.  And was Bear Man just like, oh, no. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, gosh.  He's in here again.  We can't keep him out.  Spuds Buckley.  What do you need, Spuds?  I don't know why.  He just runs in here, and security's never there.  Punch him in the face and throw him out on the street.  Andrea.  Hey.  You just saved my ass.  Thank God.  Andrea is the creator of the puppet animation called New Names that came in second place  in the mini animation contest that the radio station did.  Now we're taking their lead, and we're making this into a big, huge motherfucker of an event. 
[03:26:00]  I'm sorry you lost to a professional company there, Andrea.  Yeah, it's not fair.  No.  I don't know.  I think it was just, like, really frustrating because it took a week and a half to announce it.  I don't know what was going on there, but it was just, like, every day it was just, like,  we're going to announce it tomorrow.  We're going to announce it tomorrow.  And I think that was just really frustrating.  And then to get beaten out by it.  And it was awesome. 
[03:26:30]  It was an awesome animation, but it was, like, just frustrating that that was what won  because they were professional.  I hate to tell you, it was really, really close.  I voted for you, and I think you lost by only, like, two votes.  Uh-huh.  Faster!  That's what you get.  But I love her animation.  I love the part where she included my fiancé handing over the smelly sweats as I'm trying  to make this, like, statement in my own house that I'm now great. 
[03:27:00]  Snake audio!  That was nice.  You know what?  I need to give Jazz Green American Zero props for that because that was his idea.  Yeah.  Oh.  It's really funny.  And then when you have, uh...  Oh, wait.  I'm sorry.  I'll be...  Whose idea?  Great American Zero.  So there's two of you working on that.  Oh.  Wow.  Wow.  It was a collaboration.  Hey, wait a minute here.  You had a little help, did you?  Oh, well.  Lee wouldn't allow you in the contest.  But it's our fucking contest.  You do what the hell you want.  A little help from a faggot, huh? 
[03:27:30]  First of all, it doesn't count.  But, uh, when, when...  Yeah, when, uh, Jimmy pops on the screen and says, yeah, fucking huge laugh every fucking  time.  Very funny.  Where'd you learn how to do that animating?  What'd you do?  Uh, school.  Oh, school?  Very good.  Wait, so you took classes for this?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Then you're kind of a professional.  No.  What do you do for a living?  That's not what I do for my job.  What's your job? 
[03:28:00]  Um, photography and graphic design.  So you're...  Graphic design, though.  That's...  You're an artist.  It's part of the field.  So doesn't count.  You're an artist.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  It's part of the field.  I mean, you weren't able to make, uh, animated characters that looked like us.  Yeah.  Now, do you think anyone could do that?  Or you need some kind of talent, uh, in, in art and, and graphics?  No, not necessarily.  Oh, boy.  Not necessarily.  But you know what?  Following...  I'm sorry, Andrea, but following the rules of Flea, the great Flea...  You're out. 
[03:28:30]  You're out.  He wants complete beginners that just pick up software somewhere and go,  All right, I'm going to try to figure this out now.  Now it's retarded children with fucking finger paints.  Right.  I totally did not send Flea in at his own doing.  Andrea, I hope you're not, I hope you're not bitter enough where you're not going to be,  you know, I hope you're going to be part of the real, uh, animation festival we're getting  to go.  No, I think that was, I was just really frustrated at that point, but now I'm like, I have to.  So you're in.  Well, you know what?  I mean, you should up your game now. 
[03:29:00]  Maybe get other...  I don't know, though.  I think you have enough talent to win the whole damn thing.  I'm telling you, it was really fucking close.  You make a lot of money?  No, not at all.  Do you want to make a lot of money?  Damn it.  See, because...  Just going to hit that button.  Yeah, I know.  All right, Andrea.  Well, thanks for being a good sport, sort of.  Yeah, I, uh, yeah.  Thank you for putting me in second talk.  But do you understand the other side of this?  You got a lot of attention from your animation, which I think is cool.  I know, and that's what I love, and I'm appreciative. 
[03:29:30]  And let's get some views up today.  If you go to YouTube and you punch in, I think, just ONA new names?  Opie, Anthony's names, or puppets, whatever.  Yeah, puppets, or whatever.  It really is a great animation.  I was kind of bummed you didn't win, because I really thought it was the best one.  Yeah, it was a good one.  Definitely.  But we were fair as far as judging this thing.  And the only reason we didn't announce a winner sooner, we just hated that the contest  ended so fast and that they just didn't get it over there.  Right.  So, but we're on to the real contest now, and I hope you submit something. 
[03:30:00]  I think I will.  All right, Andrea.  Thank you.  Yeah, see?  She's fine.  Yeah, she's all right.  See, Flea?  Flea.  Stupid Flea.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Stop yelling.  Oh, my God.  Oh.  OMG.  It's a busy Manhattan morning.  I live in New York.  Everyone does a Flea impression.  You just got to sound like a douche.  Well, he's a good kid.  He just seems to be a little.  Oh, is he?  He's 30 years old. 
[03:30:30]  He's been around so long, he's got to be at least 30 at this point.  All right, Andrea.  Thank you.  Thanks.  All right.  Don't videotape me.  Don't videotape me.  I'll sue.  He's like, I'm making a statement right now.  You see the drunk Flea video?  It's hysterical.  Really?  Where he's telling, I forgot who it was, but he's telling him not to videotape him or he'll  sue.  Oh, shut up.  And he's not giving permission to put this on YouTube.  Shut the fuck up.  And then you can see it on YouTube.  Everywhere.  He's like the retarded Napoleon Dynamite.  Yeah. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, I got a laugh finally.  Thank you.  I've only been a fucking tribe for two hours here.  Fucking Sam is an instigator.  What is he saying?  What's Sam?  Sam's like, he's kind of, I figure, you know, we'll get the show going and Flea should come  in and defend himself a little bit.  If he would have steps in here.  No, please.  Like Sam knows too, that if he walked in here, opened one, gone, get the fuck out.  All right.  Sam's like, no, you ought to get in there.  He wants to get in there. 
[03:31:30]  He's coming up on the show.  Sam's a fucking prick.  I love it.  He's the best.  And because of that, now you got to grow your hair for another week.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  It's just, that's how it is.  It's, it's, it's sticking out more on the sides now and kind of flattening on top.  What's happening?  I don't have a lot of control over it all the time.  Yeah.  It just kind of does its own thing for the most part at this point.  Yeah.  All right, listen, here's the deal.  Face mask on that thing.  We're going on vacation soon.  Cool.  The last day before vacation, you shave.  It's the big finale before we go on vacation.  And then we allow Eastside Dave to officially win the contest because he's not shaving his  head. 
[03:32:00]  Well, technically, doesn't Eastside Dave still have to compete against Danny?  Ah.  That's true.  Eastside Dave's not winning this.  I don't care who's losing, but Eastside Dave will not win this contest.  And is today the day that we play What's Up Eastside Dave's Butt?  Never know when that contest is going to, you know.  Yeah, I hope not.  Friday, tomorrow.  Everybody's yelling tomorrow.  Right, tomorrow, tomorrow.  It could be any time.  Oh, that means they got a good one for tomorrow.  Ah, cool.  We don't know because we allowed Dave to decide when he wants to play What's Up Eastside Dave's  ass.  So I'm hoping before the end of the week here. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah, before we say goodbye for the weekend.  I want to give my props to James Norton.  For what?  Y'all, what up?  The Geraldo thing.  Oh, thank you.  That was very good.  Like, you know, we were having a fun interview and stuff with Geraldo, informative and everything  like that.  And then Jimmy ruined it.  I didn't even.  And Jimmy just fucking attacked him unprovoked.  Yeah.  No.  He really, like, called him out on a lot of these immigration issues.  And it was very cool.  Yeah.  You know, because you weren't backing down.  You have what you believe in.  He had what he believed in.  And I think it was a very compelling discussion you two had. 
[03:33:00]  My problem with what he was saying, because Geraldo was defending points I wasn't making.  It's almost like I wasn't, I'm not O'Reilly.  I don't, I'm not, stop mentioning crimes to me.  Right, right.  Or brown people.  You never brought that up.  I'm not saying that.  Right.  I'm not blaming illegals for the problems in this country.  And also, in one breath of you're saying it's a part of the process for everyone, but now you're  saying it's because they're brown.  And it's almost like you want to use race to point out why people don't like them. 
[03:33:30]  But, like, you're allowing yourself to use race, and you're blaming Americans for using  race.  Yeah.  It's almost like it's very convenient.  And you were also just saying, and your original point was why people in this country  are outraged at Hispanic and illegal immigrants coming from Mexico.  And he jumped on it like you were personally saying this.  And I just want to feel like people embrace American culture.  You keep your own ethnicity and your own identity. 
[03:34:00]  But I want to feel like they are a bit more assimilating.  And you can be, you can sit there and say they are at the same rate, but that's just not  the truth.  It's not, it's not common experience.  And then he's like, well, I'll challenge anybody to see it illegal.  But five minutes earlier, it's like everybody sees them every day.  It's like, what are you talking about?  Right.  I mean, it's like, we all know, and maybe the bodega, the store example I gave, wasn't  a great example.  But there's a whole thing in spoken language where, like, there's been plenty of times 
[03:34:30]  you go into a bodega.  Sometimes they're Asian, but the majority of times they're not.  And it's just, it's a very difficult to communicate what you're trying to say.  Yeah.  Because there's very, very minimal.  How many times have you been, like, Opie and I were walking by our building yesterday.  I should have mentioned this.  Four construction guys who were taking our stuff out of one of the buildings.  We were trying to say what's being built.  None of them understood what you're saying.  Yeah, they didn't speak English.  That's a perfect example.  I forgot about that.  And I wish I had thought of it.  None of them.  They're all working here. 
[03:35:00]  They're working in New York City.  None of them spoke the language.  Again, no one says, round up those brown motherfuckers and throw them out.  How about this?  Well, not no one.  Well, you know.  My favorite part of the interview is when you looked Geraldo right in the eye and you  said, you know, Geraldo, I just hate specs.  Wow.  No, I didn't do that.  Ho.  Ho.  No.  Whoa.  See, that was a joke.  That was me.  Of course it was.  Just kind of showing you how ridiculous that whole thing was.  Yes.  Okay, thanks.  Exactly.  But, Jimmy, it wasn't backing down, and I think you did a great job. 
[03:35:30]  All kidding aside, it was amazing.  Oh, thank you.  Hey, a couple things before we get out of here.  We've got to play more of the audio from the carts I found and brought in yesterday.  Shut up.  As far as that goes, I'll give you another piece of the puzzle tomorrow.  No.  And Jimmy's going to be in Atlanta, so you're going to miss the next piece of the puzzle,  but I will certainly replay that little piece for you on Monday, Jimmy.  This thing's going to have to develop a little bit.  I'm going to have to get into a comfortable place before I really, really go for it, okay? 
[03:36:00]  Skinny legs with socks pulled up on the outside of sweatpants, but it's got legs.  A little taste here, a little taste there.  I'll feel comfortable enough.  I'll come in in some hoodie and sunglasses, and then we'll really get into this.  All right?  Hey, very good idea.  The listeners come up with the best ideas.  For the animation festival, we're going to have a grand prize winner, but why not we  have a prize for a beginner animator or someone that's not professional?  Ah, beginners are faggots.  Just some kind of, we could name it something. 
[03:36:30]  The Flea's a Douchebag Award.  Yeah, the Flea Award.  For excellence in douchebaggery.  But that's not a bad idea.  We'll try to figure that out.  Yeah, for some sap that just learned how to do flash or something.  Yeah, maybe we'll do something like that.  So, all right, we'll acknowledge that we got professionals and we got just beginners attempting to win.  I influenced the show.  I changed it today.  They came up with the category because of what I said. 
[03:37:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Die.  Die.  All right, hey, so I brought carts in yesterday, another box that I unpacked in my apartment  there, and still so much other stuff to bring in.  I brought in the tape of us giving away that awful car in Boston.  That was fun.  Yeah.  We got a lot of props for that from the staff at K-Rock over there.  Oh, really?  They were coming to work.  They're like, dude, that was really funny because we could all relate to giving the listeners  some piece of shit.  Some crap.  And making believe it's good.  And then just telling them to go the fuck away. 
[03:37:30]  Right.  So yesterday we started playing some of these carts that were transferred to a CD so we  could actually play it on the radio because there's no cart machines anymore in radio stations.  And I got to communicate from the Philly crew.  And AJ and Kenny.  A mafia?  Not AJ Poopy Shits.  My AJ's cool.  AJ Poopy Shits rules.  My AJ's cool.  Where is AJ Poopy Shits, though?  We need something from him eventually. 
[03:38:00]  But AJ and Kenny, they called me up fucking dying over Darth Volker.  They really want you to bring back Darth Volker.  Wow.  It's just so old.  It's just so old.  Yeah, I know.  And I got to play this again.  And then we're going to play the ones we haven't played yet on the radio here.  But Darth Volker, which when made Anthony and I laugh so hard yesterday, we're listening  to this really old bit that's about 10, 12 years old. 
[03:38:30]  And the curses are barely bleeped out.  Yeah, that's the part that got me the most about this bit.  We actually played this on regular radio.  And it was legal.  Yeah, it was legal.  And then the FC changed their ways and said you really have to bleep out the entire curse  word now.  That's where they're at.  But back in the day, all you had to do was have some kind of beep in the middle of the  curse.  The shortest beep.  And you could hear the word fuck.  Right.  So in case you missed it yesterday, just one of the bits from one of my old carts that  I found in a box.  Buried, man.  We played this yesterday. 
[03:39:00]  I am Darth Volker.  Defy me and get a boot up your ass.  Ah, Princess Leia.  Buff my helmet.  R2D2.  Shut up, you overgrown butt plug.  I am Darth Volker.  Luke, I am your father.  Your mother was the worst f*** I ever had.  If she gave good h***, you wouldn't even be here. 
[03:39:30]  Not even close.  When she dropped her pants, it looked like she had a Wookiee in a leg lock.  Lando Carissi.  We meet again.  Shouldn't you be sitting in the back of the ship, you f***?  And you, Jabba the Hutt, you fat bastard.  You can't even see your d*** anymore, can you?  I am Darth Volker.  Yoda, make like a gerbil and crawl upon Solo's a**.  You look like a scrotum with ears. 
[03:40:00]  My balls are as big as the Death Star.  Obi-Wan, you limp d***hole f***.  You can't even get it up anymore.  Ha!  I am Darth Volker.  Motherf***er of the universe.  How?  I don't know.  It's just amazing.  How did we not get fined?  I'd fine me now.  Of course.  Of course.  I would fucking...  I want to fine myself. 
[03:40:30]  Of course.  Yes, the award will be called the Spuds Buckley Award.  Oh, la, la, la, la.  The la, la, la award for brand new animators as part of the animation festival.  Oh, here he comes again.  Oh, no.  Oh, look who it is, everybody.  Not this character.  Oh, you're a character.  No.  Do you think people at home are like, oh, Spuds Buckley's coming in.  This is my favorite part of the show.  I love this.  Stop.  Spuds Buckley's on.  No, I don't.  Spuds Buckley's on.  No, you don't.  Douche. 
[03:41:00]  What a douche he was.  I don't.  Oh, if you only had a fucking time machine.  Oh, man.  I'd give him testicular cancer.  Would you?  No problem.  No fucking problem.  I would probably, if I could get into a time machine,  I'd go back.  Go back.  I'd find Spuds Buckley, who is a young version of me, and I would fuck myself in the ass.  Wow.  Wow.  You would fuck yourself in the ass.  And it's not gay because you're fucking yourself in the ass.  It's yourself.  It's your own ass.  It's jerking off.  Right.  But Spuds Buckley would be like, you would know because you went into the time machine. 
[03:41:30]  Right.  But he wouldn't know.  No.  Because he hadn't gotten to that point yet.  So he just thinks he's being ass raped.  Right.  And you're just having fun, and it's a goof for you.  Yeah.  Waking him up.  So maybe he could develop a little faster so he doesn't have to stay in these shithole markets  year after fucking year.  Maybe that's what happened to him.  And that's why his voice was like that.  Bear man, my heart is sore.  Good morning.  La la la la la la.  Oh, no. 
[03:42:00]  Good morning, bear man.  Oh, I can't take it.  It is like, how did you get so much from four seconds, you fuckers?  It's just so bad.  That's how bad it is.  I thought that was an hour.  Dude, that's at least the beginning of one to two minutes of material.  And that's all you get today.  Because that's the brilliance of me.  La la la la la.  Oh, my goodness.  Good morning, bear man.  Good morning, bear man.  Oh, no. 
[03:42:30]  Here go the ratings.  Oh, spuds.  You've done it again.  It's true.  Done what?  Sucked.  Another piece tomorrow.  Hey, let it be known that Darth Vulgar has 874,000 views on Newgrounds.com.  I forgot.  That thing was animated a while ago.  Dan Milkman.  That's amazing.  My Vista has 2,500,000 views, by the way.  Yeah, but because you got into the whole geek culture thing.  Yeah, I did.  I really hit a nerve with that one.  It's some of my best work. 
[03:43:00]  We really got to get an animated TV show.  I hope HBO's listening to our plea.  How fucking great would that be?  It's a no-brainer at this point.  Funny as motherfucker, I think.  People love these animations.  Hey, so you want to hear more stuff in the carts I brought in?  Sure do.  Really old shit.  So keep that in mind.  And this next one we did about almost 10 years ago.  Ant and I used to drive into work.  Yes. 
[03:43:30]  And Ant was such a crazy driver that we decided to start taping our commutes into the fine city of Manhattan.  And people love this bit.  Yeah, it was not mornings either.  It was afternoon, so there was a lot of traffic and it just sucked.  Yeah.  And I had this bit because we wanted to play it a lot on cart.  Here it is.  Cart.  Look at all the kids going to see Daddy.  Come on.  Oh, my God. 
[03:44:00]  Okay, that's us driving by the prison.  Yeah, that's right.  I always thought it was little boys walking into Ant's house.  That's what he called himself.  Y'all coming to see Daddy.  Yeah.  That's before I left the house.  Opie.  Oh, wow.  Maybe the black.  This is the guy that knows how to linger longer.  Maybe the black guy.  This is Matt Lamb from the city.  Maybe the black guy in Buffalo was Ope in blackface going back in time to fuck himself in the ass. 
[03:44:30]  Hey, wow.  That could have been you.  And then he gives me a linger boo, boo, boo.  He had to go through the chimney.  That's why.  Maybe he landed in the chimney.  Yeah.  And it was soot.  Sooty.  Dude.  You got a little sooty.  I should have known, man.  That whole rape thing that almost happened to me.  God damn it.  That was me going back in a time machine.  I didn't even know.  At some point, you are going to find a time machine.  Right.  But if you are going to, why don't you just come back now and say something to yourself. 
[03:45:00]  Right.  What?  Just to prove that, you know.  Oh.  I don't know.  Walk in.  Spuds.  Say la la la.  La la la.  Good morning, Bear.  Oh, no.  Oh, good gravy.  Here comes some madcap fun.  Shut up.  Madcap.  Oh, boy.  Strap in, folks.  Give me one of those days.  He's here again.  That's crazy.  He's incorrigible.  La la la.  And by incorrigible, I mean completely unfunny. 
[03:45:30]  Hello, Bear Man.  That should be followed by a gunshot.  Do you have one in the replay?  I'm laughing because I don't want to cry.  Laugh.  Let me see something here.  Oh, yeah.  I would love to hear that.  This is my impression of that day.  La la la la la.  Good morning, Bear Man. 
[03:46:00]  Hey, I'm getting props.  Bobby D from Brockton writes,  Opie needs to sue the creators of Spongebob for stealing his Spongebuckly voice.  Yeah.  See?  I was an innovator.  You know who's giving you props?  Spuds B from Buffalo.  Stupid Spudz Buckley.  You know who should give you props?  A Cessna 180.  Or Carrot Top.  Here.  Improve that bit.  All right.  Here's us driving to work. 
[03:46:30]  The first comment was us driving by a prison as they're waiting in line to go in and see  Daddy.  Look at all the kids going to see Daddy.  Come on.  Oh, that woman has no teeth.  No teeth.  Sweetie, you need a burger.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Oh.  That guy's got to be guilty of something.  What up, G?  What up?  Never seen one with blonde hair. 
[03:47:00]  That's the same f**k that would be honking if you were in his way in a green light.  Look at these d**holes.  Look at this guy.  Hit him.  Oh, my God.  I'd ram right into the side of him.  Would have made that light.  Billie Jean King called.  She wants her hairstyle back.  My lane here.  My lane.  A**hole.  Now you don't get in.  F**k you.  Hey, Fabio. 
[03:47:30]  See that guy?  I cannot believe it's not about the wall.  Look at up there.  Where?  Coming out from behind there.  That's a dude.  Oh, it's...  Shut up.  That guy's got the biggest s**ts I've ever seen.  Yay.  No.  You think we're playing up to the f**king recorder?  Not at all.  Oh, my God.  I can't listen to this s**t.  Why?  It's very organic dialogue on the way to work.  But there's two geniuses riffing. 
[03:48:00]  It happens every day on the way to work.  This is why...  F**k you, Jimmy.  What?  This is why when they have those discussions on the fan side...  They were so much better at N.E.W.  I tell you, I laugh inside because I know it's not true.  I just...  Because listen to this.  It's like people remember this as a really good bit.  I had to stop the tape.  It's not a good bit.  No.  We are playing up to the recording.  You could hear.  When you know you're being recorded, you're not just going to sit there and drive like 
[03:48:30]  you normally would.  No, I disagree.  I think it sounded...  I felt like I was a fly on the wall.  Just listening to two people...  More like a fly on a pile of s**t.  Just listening to two people who comment comedically constantly.  Who's that guy?  Look at that fat guy.  Get out of here.  Who's that car?  Nice car.  Hey, there's rust on that one.  Look how tall that building is.  It was just non-stop improvisation.  What a ride into work.  How'd you have anything left for the air? 
[03:49:00]  Oh, God.  You suck.  That is so funny.  Constantly.  My new catchphrase is, fuck you, ad name here.  Fuck you, G-baby.  Can't you believe it's not butter oak?  Can't you?  And then, Smokezilla.  I can't believe it's not talent.  And fucking Jared from Rochester.  Did you guys...  I don't update.  Hold on.  Did you guys have a blimp in the back of the truck? 
[03:49:30]  Just in case we had to take off and bomb a building with bra bombs.  I wish we had the audio of the guy knocking the mirror off the side of my car.  I don't.  Rod J. from Colorado Springs.  Wait, can we hear more of the organic dialogue?  Sure.  Just keeping in mind, this is two guys driving to work who comment on everything at every moment.  But we are so much better when we're on NAW.  What the fuck is this?  Hold on a minute. 
[03:50:00]  John and Auburn.  John, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just wanted to see if Ophie could do his awesome impression of Fabio again.  I can't believe it's not...  He's right.  I'm going to hack my entire career.  Let's go to Sean, North Carolina.  Sean?  That guy's got the biggest tips.  Anthony's there.  Why didn't you stop and give A-Rock a lift?  What the hell? 
[03:50:30]  I think that guy did something wrong.  Look at that.  He's got blonde hair.  Big tits for a guy.  Just riffing all the way to work, you know?  Yeah, just riffing.  Yeah, just laughs on wheels.  So, Charity, we ride our bus into your town and just make you laugh all the way home organically.  Just riffing organically.  Mongo, what's up?  Sounds like Spuds Buckley got hit with the sword of the gate.  Two T-cells.  Two T-cells. 
[03:51:00]  I hated that until he did the two T-cells line.  Yeah.  And now I don't.  Let's say hi to Dave in Tennessee.  See, they picked right up on it.  Dave?  Hey, good morning, guys.  I just wanted to hear more from you crazy motherhuckers on the way to work.  Crazy motherhuckers.  All right, here's us just riffing, you know, because we're that damn good.  We're done.  Yay.  No, no.  Just go home.  I'll let you go. 
[03:51:30]  You can go anywhere.  Wax on, wax off.  Oh, why are we stopping?  Come on.  Look at this.  It's the way it happens.  Oh, come on.  Maybe they drive like that in Bangladesh, not here.  See?  It's funny.  I pick off your top.  Yeah, you eat that ice cream.  Oh, God damn.  Wow.  Thank God there was a crowd of people that commented on every single, never adult moment.  That's what the name of this is.  Never adult moment. 
[03:52:00]  It was just constant excitement.  Oh, my God.  And something to comment on.  And talking about every, this is how you know it's organic, because people always go,  ah, darn, slowing down, 25, 24, 23.  Why are we stopping again?  Ah, yellow light, red light, green light.  It's like these people were lined up for our amusement.  Yeah.  It's perfectly lined up.  It's there.  You got the black guy with the blonde hair.  You got the fat bitch.  With the tits.  You got the gay guy.  You got the Bangladesh guy.  Bangladesh cab driver.  You got the Asian kid.  It's perfect. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pick off your top.  Yeah, you eat that ice cream.  Mojo jokes, you know.  Out of the way.  Coming through.  Oh, this is awful.  My lane.  My lane.  Out of the way.  Ah, you f***ing a**hole.  I was robbed.  Holy Jesus.  I'll get you, my pretty.  And you little dog, too.  What is that?  What was that for?  What is that?  I have no f***ing idea.  What? 
[03:53:00]  Awful.  What was that for?  Horrid.  It was obviously an older lady that looked like, you know, the witch.  Oh, God.  I wouldn't care if it was the witch.  Why?  The only sound I want to hear is this truck crashing and the crackling of our fat burning.  This is terrible.  No, what sound you should hear?  The sound of a f***ing train car striking a motor vehicle.  Like a train horn and the car just f***ing broadsiding the car. 
[03:53:30]  The only authentic thing on that tape would be our screams.  Yes.  That would be good.  Oh, hey, is that a train?  Ha, ha, opie.  Wah, wah.  What was the name of the f***ing movie?  Some crazy Mary something Larry?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nothing's going to stop us now.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, and then the train gets them.  Well, Matt LaFarre from Queensbury.  Yeah.  He writes, two guys, one douche chill.  And then you get, this is a linger longer.  The guy writes, no wonder you and Ant drove around after work and never wanted to go home. 
[03:54:00]  Constant natural hilarity.  Absolutely.  Why get out of that?  Why get out of that nuthouse?  Really?  There's funny shit happening everywhere.  Are you kidding me?  You got B-Car from Orange County.  He writes, such natural dialogue.  Hey, Ant, you're in my f***ing car.  Yes.  Yeah.  Wow.  What's the name of that show we were watching?  It's called Everyone's Fodder. 
[03:54:30]  You ready for more?  I could not be more ready.  What the hell is he looking at?  Hey, everyone.  It's Arsenio Hall.  Arsenio?  Hey, it's Gary Coleman.  Watch out.  He'll punch you in the knee.  Oh, look here.  Oh!  Please tell me you both just realized what you were doing. 
[03:55:00]  Oh, my God.  There was our release, yeah.  Everyone has to drink.  Open the impression.  Yeah, someone's suggesting.  Chad from L.A.  Benny Hill should be playing in the background.  Oh, my God.  Look at these things.  Socks full of sand. 
[03:55:30]  Sacky tits, I guess.  Oh, just keep going through red lights.  Keep going.  Pickle aid!  Pump me off so you can just stop.  You f***ing dick!  Pickle aid!  Oh, my God.  Hey, look.  It's the frugal gourmet.  Hey, more steady boys lately.  Hey, frugal gourmet.  I think that actually was him.  It looked like.  That's it.  Just walk in the road.  Doesn't matter.  Oh, my God.  Look at the fossil getting out of this car.  Jesus.  Life.  Hug. 
[03:56:00]  Come on.  Come on.  Just go.  No one in front of you.  What a f***.  You can't pick up a fair in the middle of the road, you f***ing a**hole.  Holy s***.  He's stopping in the left turn lane.  Oh, my God.  It's Link from the Mott Squad.  Just in case we didn't know.  Where?  What did that do?  We're almost there.  Make this light.  Make this light.  Come on.  We're one block away.  Go.  Go.  Match for conversation.  Absolutely.  Coming through.  No wonder you guys decided to take this. 
[03:56:30]  Hey, hey, hey.  Coming through.  Yeah.  Yeah, we made it.  It stopped.  Sanctuary.  It's good to know that our commute took three minutes.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  And what happened?  Three minutes from a long time.  That's just amazing.  The commute took just enough time to fit between songs.  And the amazing thing is all of those laughs on a daily basis, both directions, why wouldn't  you get the tape recorder going?  What are we doing?  This gold is flying out the windows. 
[03:57:00]  We're giving this gold to the dashboard.  What's the matter with us?  Cheap Baby writes, fuck you, Jimmy.  Arsenio Hall whooping and then a midget punch in the knee joke.  Simply perfect humor.  And very naturalist, the way you go back and forth.  Yeah, I know.  That's what it was.  Eric B. from New Hampshire.  Way to tag that zinger, Opie.  Watch out.  He'll punch you in the knee.  Just a giant laughing box.  And Philly fan.  Four wheels on it.  Philly fan writes, now I know where the car crash came from.  This should have been a tube from the exhaust pipe right into the window. 
[03:57:30]  Jay Mansfield's wig should have fucking been at the end of that car ride.  Look, man.  What other radio show's brave enough to do this?  Oh, really?  Go break out those pictures of yourself when you're 18.  Then you'll understand what we're going through here.  Two douches, one car.  Yeah, thanks.  I bet you guys were sitting in a parked car.  The horn sounded like you were not moving.  Well, I beat my horn when I'm not moving. 
[03:58:00]  Someone wants to know if I, this is Steve G.  He writes, hey, did you say, hey, we made it every time you guys got to work?  Yeah, I know, yeah.  Hey, we made it.  Very natural.  Because that's what you do when you pull up and you go, hey, we made it.  Billy S writes, make it better and tell everyone this bit was so old you were recording from a truck wagon.  Hey, we made it.  Oh, God.  Go, go, go.  Go to my lane.  I'm driving.  Now I'm driving. 
[03:58:30]  I'm hitting the gas.  Oh, great.  Slow down.  Oh, great.  Yellow light.  Look at that guy.  Who is he?  Looks like that's your mind.  Oh, great.  Going again.  Oh, my goodness.  Ricky Murphy from Massachusetts.  Knowing Opie, he probably hyped this for three days and replayed it all week.  I think we did.  Can I take you inside what just happened?  I'm ready to play this thing from these old cards.  I swear I didn't listen ahead of time.  I'm listening to it cold like most people out there.  Cold as douche chills.  And I remember thinking that, wow, this is a really good bit. 
[03:59:00]  This is going to be cool to hear again.  And halfway through it, I'm like, oh, my God.  We got to turn the fucking mics on and acknowledge how hacky and awful this really is.  Oh.  Ugh.  Well, let's go.  I don't know.  We just.  Let's go to Cigars and Scotch.  Cigars and Scotch.  Yes.  I found more lost audio from this bit.  Oh, OK.  Oh, hey, Anthony.  Watch this.  I'll tap the guy with my bumper and scare the shit out of him.  Ha, ha, ha.  Oh, cool.  We got to fucking crash Cigars and Scotch.  Yeah, I like that. 
[03:59:30]  Let's go to Chris.  What's up, Chris?  Chris.  Hey, Chris.  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  You talking to me?  Yeah.  Hey, man.  Fucking this is Jimmy.  You're killing me tearing them a new asshole.  You're fucking hysterical.  I want to know, Jimmy.  Could I hire you?  Because I have a few people I need their assholes chewed.  And you would be a perfect, uh...  You want me to chew their assholes?  Their fucking Chinese versions of yes?  Yeah. 
[04:00:00]  No, I'm sorry.  I'm not a fucking, uh...  I'm not a surprise boss.  I don't put on a suit and pretend I'm with the parent company.  And then start goofing and doing abortion jokes.  Yeah.  But thank you, sir.  I'm glad you're enjoying it.  We have another one from the old carts.  These are well over 10 years old for the most part.  Uh, remember...  Oh, uh...  How long ago did the Blair Witch Project come out?  Oh, my God.  Anyone?  Probably...  About 10 years ago?  Eight to 10 years ago?  Nine years ago?  Something like that? 
[04:00:30]  Maybe 10?  Uh, Smud from Whackbag.  Surprised we didn't hear Opie telling people to back off, bro!  Oh, hey, we made it, brother man!  Yeah, we made it, mother huckers!  I wonder if George Burns would say this while he was driving.  Right, Timmy.  I feel such...  Oh, dude, it was...  It's inexcusable.  Pray for me. 
[04:01:00]  Hey, we made it to the garage.  Yeah.  Say goodnight, Gracie.  Nine years, okay.  Nine years.  Oh, God.  Nine years ago for Blair Witch Project, so of course we had to do our own version called  Scare Shitless Project.  That's us going up into Harlem, you know.  Oh, is that it?  I have no idea what this is going to sound like.  I haven't heard this in 10, 9 years, whatever.  Ew.  Well, hold on to your hats, kids.  Just more audio I found.  More hilarity.  More audio I found in these boxes that I thought was so...  That these things were so good, I had to carry them from apartment to apartment to apartment. 
[04:01:30]  It all started with three college students in the haunted woods in Maryland, and now it  continues with two DJs in the streets of Harlem.  We're going to bring like a dat recorder and we're going to record our day in Harlem.  It was just supposed to be a goofy radio bit.  I'll find the tape years later.  That's precisely what happened, and this is what they found.  What is that? 
[04:02:00]  Oh my God.  What's that sound?  Young cracker, get the fuck out of the motherfucking car.  Oh my God.  Dodge.  See what happens when Whitey goes to the hood?  It's a pile of crack pipes outside our tent.  What does it mean?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I came up here.  I'm sorry. 
[04:02:30]  What is that?  Yeah, just a goofy radio bit.  What was that?  The Scared S***less Project.  You gotta give up Ian Anthony a lot of credit.  What was that?  The first comment.  It didn't take long.  Jay Harra writes.  Okay.  He writes, the No Funny Project. 
[04:03:00]  Why?  That was very good.  The black voice.  Oh, the black voice was great.  Yeah.  Who was that?  And someone writes, how did he get this job?  Was the XM interviewer deaf?  Wow.  Holy Jesus.  You should put that bit up on Shitburger.  Byrd in Philly writes, why don't you just put these things back in the box?  Were we ever good? 
[04:03:30]  This is terrible.  I don't know.  I guess Bob is, like, probably the best agent ever.  What is he, Jedi mind trick these motherfuckers?  I'm now going to call him fucking Doug Henney Eatman.  Oh, yeah, well.  Let's say hi to Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  I only discovered you boys like two years ago. 
[04:04:00]  Yeah.  Boy, did I dodge a bullet.  Boo, boo, boo, boo.  Boo, boo, boo, boo.  Do we have time for one more?  I hope not.  One more.  This is called the, uh, the schlong song.  The schlong song?  It was on cart.  It's just bad, bad dick jokes.  It was on cart, which means we thought enough of this that we wanted it handy to play at any given moment. 
[04:04:30]  Right there at our fingertips.  Not funny.  Not funny.  Oh, no.  Okay.  This one.  Please no more, people are saying.  Mutton dagger, old blind bob, hanging Johnny, fishing rod, tally, wrapper, pocket rocket, one-eyed trouser trout. 
[04:05:00]  Ding dong, ankle spanker, pork sword, engine cranker, hairy hot dog, Davey, cock it.  Let them all hang out.  Pet names for genitalia.  You know the girls need double and you gotta love them.  Pet names for genitalia.  There's always something silly about little Willie.  Wang, wazoo, weenie, wacker, pecker, peepee, kidney, cracker, heat, seeking, moisture, missile, giggle, stink, love, whistle, tube, steak.  Uncle Dick, this is getting really sick. 
[04:05:30]  I'm not through.  There's one more.  Purple helmet warrior.  Pet names for genitalia.  You know the girls need double and you gotta love them.  Pet names for genitalia.  There's always something silly about little Willie.  Pet names for genitalia.  You know the girls need double and you gotta love them.  I can think of a pet name for genitalia.  You're forgetting a couple of tools.  Two more.  Two more.  Opie Anthony. 
[04:06:00]  That damn has a line.  Opie Anthony.  Pet names for genitalia.  Something silly about little Willie.  So you douches out there that think we were better in the NAW days.  Oh, you losing the argument today.  Oh boy, have you lost the argument today.  Steve from Rockland has a good comment.  Yes, Steve.  Steve.  I have been a devoted fan for 12 years. 
[04:06:30]  What the fuck was I thinking?  I hate these guys today.  Nat Fanny.  Just Nat Fanny.  Awful.  Nat Fanny.  There's something silly about little...  What's silly?  Willie.  Come on, Jim.  There's some silly names that you come up with.  Sure.  Purple Helmet Warrior.  I guess we don't have time to play anymore, right?  Shoehorning.  Shoehorning.  Warrior.  Warrior.  It was a different time. 
[04:07:00]  Yeah.  Yes.  One devoid of humor.  And this is what kind of douches we were?  This is the kind of douches we were back then, too.  Because we're sitting there after every show going,  God damn it, why haven't they syndicated us yet?  We got exposed more people to the greatness of this radio show.  Oh, that just hurts now.  What happened?  Cigars and Scotch.  Carol Miller was right.  Hey, if you remind me, we'll play those tapes tomorrow.  Eastside Dave. 
[04:07:30]  Not today?  Not tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  Mm-hmm.  Tomorrow, sir.  Tomorrow, Mr. Opie.  Oh.  Tomorrow we play What's Up, Eastside Dave's Butt?  Tomorrow, yeah.  Ron and Fez are cool with that?  Eastside Dave's Noon to Three, yes.  Oh, they're cool with everything.  All right, good.  Of course they are.  All right.  Ron and Fez Noon to Three, thank you.  Yep.  Very good.  Do you have the parody you guys did to Aerosmith's Falling in Love is so Harder Than These?  Yeah, I did find that.  I don't know if it's on this.  Was that on it?  Oh, I gave that thing to E-Rock. 
[04:08:00]  E-Rock has that.  Who's birthday?  The Aerosmith thing?  The really gay parody song done to Aerosmith?  Right.  You want to do another one real fast?  No.  Oh, this is just the Sharpton traffic music.  All right.  And when Ant was doing his Sharpton, I am outreached.  Yeah, that whole thing.  That was just a bed for when he was doing that.  So that one, we got off easy on that one.  Then this, I don't even remember this.  South Park Opie and Anthony song?  What the fuck is this? 
[04:08:30]  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  This can't be good.  E-Rock's making a disgusted face like someone just showed him a stick of celery.  You found the, uh...  Is this the one?  Because you said something different.  That's the only one you gave me.  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  It's not.  That's the only one you gave me.  Oh, all right.  There's one about...  I can't remember now.  All right.  We'll find it.  All this stuff will surface eventually.  South Park Opie and Anthony song.  Kick it.  Anthony!  Anthony!  Well, spank my ass in cold with Charlie. 
[04:09:00]  Isn't this exciting?  What?  You said you're going to kick your ass again?  Shut up, Cartman.  If some girl tried to kick my ass, I'd be like...  Anthony!  I, I, I...  Why don't you stop?  Damn, Cartman.  Jesus.  Jesus.  I want to tap my toes.  Shotgun.  Fucking trigger.  Well, I'll tell you why that's kind of cool, though.  Why?  That was actual Matt or Trey saying Opie in the Cartman voice for us because we had one  of the first interviews.  They used to be friends of the show. 
[04:09:30]  Then we made a little thing out of it.  Oh, maybe that's right.  Okay.  Oh, all right.  So we have to brag a little bit there.  That was special, special production done just for us from our old, old friends Matt  and Trey blew us off since they became famous when they really blew up to, like, fuck you  guys.  Pat from Monagy says he feels like he's been unplugged from the O&A Matrix.  Very funny, Pat, you nine-toed fucker.  Stoner Spelling Bee.  Hey, kids.  It's now time for another edition of Stoner Spelling Bee. 
[04:10:00]  The word today is asterisk.  A-S-T-A-S-T-E-R-S-I-K.  Asterisk.  A-S-T-E-R-C-R-I-K.  Asterisk.  A-S-T-E-R-I-C.  That's pretty good for a stone boy.  Pretty good.  And he thinks he got it right.  Asterisk.  Asterisk.  A-S-T-E-R-I-K.  E-R-I-K.  Yeah, that's it, man.

[04:11:00]  Let's go to John in North Carolina.  John.  Let's go to Jim in New York.  I quit.  IndyS is suggesting, from Tennessee,  he's suggesting that,  hey, Opa, this shit should have went in the fire  with the Java log.  Messed up his fine line, sorry.  Brad Pitt has a better surprise in his box  than Opie does.  Dirty Joe with that one.  Spell hack, Opie. 
[04:11:30]  Hey, John, North Carolina, what's up?  Jimmy?  Yes, sir.  How hungry were you to jump on these coattails?  My God.  There weren't exactly coattails  that were moving very quickly.  They were just kind of laying there in the mud.  I was actually trying to pick them up  just to get them out of the dirt.  Rob, New Hampshire, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey.  If it makes you boys feel any better,  Hillman still has us as a rotation  for Looney Tune Tuesday. 
[04:12:00]  Which one?  The genitalia song.  Oh, please.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  And let's go to Phil.  Phil.  Phil?  Phil Connors.  What's up, Phil?  Cupid, guys.  Just admit it's Scott Shannon tapes from last week  and you're just doing Cupid.  I'd love to be able to admit that or say that,  but no.  Sorry.  And then you had Howard yelling  that we were ripping him off.  Okay.  Wow.  Proving a lot of...  Who the hell wants to admit to that?  Yeah, no kidding. 
[04:12:30]  Are you working on anything, Iraq?  I gave you a bunch of stuff.  Yeah, we're pulling up more war stuff.  Pulling up more war stuff stuff  from some of the discs you gave us.  All right.  Like little tidbits like this  you got to give to me so we can play.  All right.  We end...  Out of all the cards I brought in yesterday,  we end with the fine Sunset Thomas.  This ended up on our Dementor World CD.  Her just kind of, you know,  playing with herself.  Oh, yeah.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Hotter.  Hotter.  Oh, yeah. 
[04:13:00]  Oh, hotter.  Oh, yeah.  Give it to me.  Higher.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Mmm.  Don't stop.  Don't stop.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Mmm.  Mmm.  All right.  See?  All right. 
[04:13:30]  We didn't wreck that.  That's all it is.  Thank God.  I'm sitting here going,  I guarantee we wreck a hot...  One of us, yeah.  A hot fucking orgasm.  Blurt something stupid out.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Another look down memory lane.  This old school Opie and Anthony thing  is starting to take on a life of its own.  I got so many...  Thanks.  Yeah.  I opened up a box yesterday.  It was easily a hundred cassettes from BAB.  A hundred.  Wow.  I don't even fucking... 
[04:14:00]  A hundred of them.  Want to...  Want to hazard to guess.  So, I got to bring these things in slowly but surely.  But we gave you a little taste today.  And Sam's working on...  I gave Sam a whole box of VHS tapes,  and he's going through it.  And hopefully he'll have something else for tomorrow.  I don't even know what's on a lot of these,  you know, VHS tapes anymore.  Oh, man.  But that's where the car thing came from today.  All right.  Line of the day brought to you by  SkiColoradoNow.com  for info on great deals on 26 world-class resorts. 
[04:14:30]  Up to the minute snow condition.  Log on to SkiColoradoNow.com.  Jimmy, you got to go, right?  Yeah, I'm shooting for Comedy Central today.  What is that about?  Just hosting that show for them.  Nice.  Live at Gotham.  It's a stand-up show.  That's awesome.  On Saturday.  Much of us doing it.  Very, very cool.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  A couple of dinners on the road,  and now he wants to sleep under the piano in the lounge.  What's the matter with you?  Let's go right to the next runner-up line of the day.  But they're going to just go over the top of this one. 
[04:15:00]  As soon as we get the latest info,  where were you on 3-6?  Where were you?  That was funny.  Doesn't mean anything if you didn't hear the bit.  No.  So, one more runner-up line of the day.  I just heard the boom, and then I saw the pile of smoke rising up.  Sounds like that guy hears a lot.  Absolutely.  Usually out of the back of his chaps, his ass with chaps, the smoke is rising up.  Yeah. 
[04:15:30]  What a coincidence.  This is the second manhole explosion of the night.  The first one was the door at the bar.  He was filming.  Who got it officially?  I'm like, ooh, it was me.  Oh, it's Jimmy.  Ooh, it's me.  Oh, it's Jimmy.  Ooh.  Oh, it's Jimmy.  Jimmy, have fun in Atlanta.  Oh, thank you, man.  I'm going to miss...  Because of you, I'm being picked up tomorrow by a Jetsons car.  Oh, Bob?  Or Steve?  Jetsons car.  Steve. 
[04:16:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  Going to take the ride in on...  Yeah, not anymore.  ...me and Steve riding to work tomorrow.  Nice.  Why don't you record it?  Get me a tape recorder.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We're here.  Look, we're driving slowly.  Here we go.  Ooh, look at the cock on him.  15 minutes of silence.  I drove eight hours to fucking Cleveland with Opie, and it was an hour of conversation  and seven hours of fucking mute.  Just dead silence.  We drove to Cleveland together.  Yes, I forgot about that. 
[04:16:30]  Wow, we started off strong, though, man.  We had a good, solid hour, and then realized, wow, we have nothing else to say to each other.  Wow.  Except Lonely Highway.  Yeah, and Opie doing goofy shit in the driver's seat, trying to pass the time.  What?  Yeah.  Hank's Place.  What are you talking about?  You guys, you were telling about how you sat there listening, I think it's called Willie's  Place now, but the Hank's Place channel?  Yeah.  Just sitting there listening to old, depressing country music.  Dude, because I was out of work for two years.  I was just driving around.  I had XM way, way before we ever got a gig, and I was lonely, man. 
[04:17:00]  Hank's Place got me through some tough times on the road.  The truckers know what I'm talking about.  The truckers know.  I don't even, I didn't even know half the sorrows, but man, I was, it's me in my life.  Everything died in my life.  Everything.  Jeez.  Well, at least Spuds Buckley was one of those things. 
[04:17:30]  Here is your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  You see the picture of the Neverland?  Yeah.  It's just completely falling apart.  We're down.  Looks like I am legend.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I went there.  I brought the kids there.  They loved it.  The movie theater.  Kept her eye out of the eye.  I hope. 
[04:18:00]  They were girls.  They still are.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Oh, no.  Good morning, Bear Man.  Ah, you had to know.  You had to know that one was going to be the old tagger on it.  Remember, guys, I paved the way.  Yeah.  Whatever I had to do.  Certainly did.  La, la, la, la, la, la. 
[04:18:30]  Oh, no.  Good morning, Bear Man.  My chick last night, actually, I got home from.  Left you.  You know how I'm unloading boxes?  She's packing boxes at this point.  My lovely fiancee got home yesterday, and that's what greeted me.  She had her Mac pretty much at the door.  I'm like, what are you doing?  And she just went.  Click.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  Because I thought.  She made it was cute?  Well, what happened was this guy, he emailed me these audio clips onto my Black Brewery. 
[04:19:00]  I can't play audio off the BlackBerry, obviously, so I transferred it to her email account.  So I didn't even know what he actually had.  So she knew before me, and she just pushed it.  She goes, is this it?  And then she looks at me.  She goes, why?  And I said, I was making 12 Gs a year.  You've got to understand.  I had to do whatever it took.  You were overpaid.  You should have come home until the computer opened up, and the ring you got her sitting  on the key that started the sound. 
[04:19:30]  Jeez.  I got to go piss, man.  All right.  Oh.  I will see you guys.  Right?  Monday.  Monday morning.  Yes.  On to Atlanta.  Break a leg in Atlanta, Jimmy.  Yeah.  What?  We're still broadcasting, Roland.  Could you sign a shirt?  It's for Benga.  You need your autograph.  I want you to sign that for a shirt.  It's for his shirt.  It's just, uh...  I don't know.  I, I, I, I just...  The show's still going, but I don't know.  I don't know if you guys think, uh...  What the fuck is that?  You think you'd want him? 
[04:20:00]  I get it.  Now you see, he's only in town Monday.  Monday?  Monday?  Hey, yo.  Your island has beat my rangers.  Bye, guys.  Have a terrific weekend.  Jimmy, you too.  Hey, Godspeed.  Congratulations.  Godspeed to you.  Can't be good.  Be careful.  Where's my sunglasses?  They're all in CBS.  I hope, uh...  Did someone go get them?  Oh, someone didn't bring them.  They, they run up our stuff and they bring half the shit. 
[04:20:30]  Okay.  That's how we end today, I guess.  Yeah.  Bye, guys.  Bye, Jimmy.  Oh, wait.  Wait, wait.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, man.  Everyone's thinking about him.  Yeah, man.  Jimmy, just for you, look.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, man.  Play that for Stupid Bob tomorrow.  Oh, we will.  We will.  We will, sir.  We will.  And I got to communicate for my brother.  I leave you with this today.  I guess we're, uh...  We're doing the hang at FH Riley's for the next...  Oh!  The big St. Paddy's Day Parade is happening in Huntington this Sunday, Ant. 
[04:21:00]  And we're going to have a big to-do at FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village.  It's a great, great place to be for the parade, man.  The Huntington St. Paddy's Day Parade is a blast.  So if you want to do some of that drinking, I'll be teetotaling.  Nice.  Teetotaling.  Teetotaling.  Teetotaling.  You know what I like?  I like when, especially around North Shore of Long Island, when you just go into a bar 
[04:21:30]  and you're drinking on St. Paddy's Day because you have so much elbow room, and bagpipes guys  come in.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Like, we're in a fucking closed-in area.  Right.  Stop with the bagpipes.  I'm trying to drink a Guinness.  And Saturday, a bunch of us will be down at FH Riley's as well.  So it's an FH Riley's weekend, I think.  FH Riley's double-shot weekend.  Yeah, but definitely Sunday for the parade. 
[04:22:00]  We had a lot of fun last year, man.  A lot of fucking fun.  Well, that was the gay parade.  The gay parade?  I'm kidding, of course.  It's a little ass-fuck joke.  They should do both those parades at the same time.  Oh, yeah.  Just have them start out at opposite ends of town and meet in the middle.  Oof.  All right.  Dude, what happened? 
[04:22:30]  It'll knock you on your goddamn ass.  Jesus Christ, what an anticlimactic piece of crap that was.  Okay.  Worldwide.  We'll be right back.  I'm right back.  I'm right back.  Houston.  We're perfect.  We're perfect.  We'll be right back to you.  Loved.  We're perfect.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  What an anticlimactic piece.  What an anticlimactic piece is being targeted to us for the bloody בש Monument?  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back. iyeb По labourers as a little pes et bicoart us up.  Yeah, I'll be right back.  Sempre in oペMe1e.  We'll be right back.  America isn't even better.  We'll be right back.
