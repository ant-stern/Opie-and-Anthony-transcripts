<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a discussion of the Nigerian schoolgirls' kidnapping and the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of celebrity activism like the #BringBackOurGirls campaign.  The hosts expressed skepticism, labeling it "slacktivism," and criticized the Nigerian government's response and the extremist group's apparent indifference.  This transitioned into a conversation about Michael Sam's public kiss after being drafted into the NFL, with the hosts describing their own initial awkwardness and discomfort, contrasting this with the negative reaction and subsequent fallout faced by Miami Dolphins player Don Jones for his critical tweet.  They also played a video of Sam's kiss and discussed the societal pressure to suppress such reactions.  The segment further included commentary on a purportedly fake Donald Sterling tape and Charles Barkley’s refusal to apologize for jokes about overweight women, playing audio clips of both.  The hosts wove in references to George Orwell's *1984*, relating it to the suppression of dissenting opinions.

The show continued with a debate on whether Charles Barkley should apologize for his comments, initially diverging in opinion before ultimately agreeing an apology was warranted. This led to the comedic revelation that their initial disagreement stemmed from an opinion from Les Moonves' wife.  The hosts then launched into a discussion of their own "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest, filled with offensive jokes about overweight women and graphic descriptions of unattractive physical attributes. This transitioned into a discussion about the absence of obese animals in nature, oddly seguing into an incident involving NHL player P.K. Subban and Sean Thornton squirting water at him, sparking a debate on whether the action was racist.  A caller, Sonny from Boston, brought up the Subban incident. The hosts then reviewed several recent public apologies, including those from Charles Barkley, Donald Sterling, Don Jones, and Nintendo (for the lack of same-sex relationships in *Tomodaki Life*), expressing cynicism toward their pervasiveness.  The Nintendo apology discussion included a detailed recounting of a gay gamer's social media campaign.

The latter part of the show featured Chris Jericho as a guest.  The hosts reminisced about his previous appearances, discussed his band Fozzy, and delved into his wrestling career, recounting incidents like his suspension for kicking a Brazilian flag and a fine for being in the ring when Batista bled.  Jericho shared details about his interactions with Vince McMahon and the WWE's response to these incidents. He also discussed his son's reaction to a Black Sabbath concert.

Jericho’s segment continued with a discussion of the WWE’s shift from the “Attitude Era” to a more family-friendly image, contrasting it with the extreme violence he witnessed in Japanese wrestling promotions. He detailed gruesome matches, including those involving barbed wire, exploding mines, and even a piranha tank.  He discussed the financial struggles of wrestlers, using Mick Foley as an example.  He then recounted his experiences at the KISS Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, including a humorous interaction with Paul Stanley, Stanley's criticism of the ceremony, and anecdotes from KISS members' autobiographies (including details about sexual encounters and health issues). He also promoted his podcast, "Talk is Jericho," and his upcoming tour and album release.  The segment concluded with an extensive critique of a SiriusXM DJ, Denny Falcone, dissecting his on-air style, playing various airchecks, and discussing radio DJing techniques, mentioning other notable DJs like Dan Ingram and Ron Lundy.


A segment focused on frequent guest Dennis Falcone, nicknamed "Menacing,"  saw the hosts and Falcone brainstorming alternative nicknames, which often devolved into vulgarity.  The conversation became graphic, detailing Falcone's eating habits and alleged self-pleasuring habits. Burt Bacharach's birthday was mentioned, leading to a hilariously butchered rendition of "Do You Know the Way to San Jose."  The discussion circled back to Michael Sam's kiss and the suppression of natural reactions to unfamiliar displays of affection.  Falcone shared stories from his childhood, discussing ethnic tensions and fights, and recounted a bizarre encounter with a fan at a comedy gig. A caller inquired about attire for an upcoming Opie and Anthony "super show," fueling further vulgar banter.  The segment concluded with a Bill Burr bit on unexpected same-sex public displays of affection and an apology from a Canadian political candidate for a sexist Facebook post.


The final segment featured a phone call with a female listener, which rapidly descended into vulgar and offensive questions about her Mother's Day activities.  The caller mentioned the upcoming "super show" and its requested attire.  Comedian Colin Quinn joined the call, leading to discussions about his attire for the event, past experiences (including a mugging), the event's date, and Quinn's jury duty. The segment concluded with the hosts abruptly ending the call in a chaotic and irreverent manner.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, let's do it.  Morning, everybody.  The familiar music.  There it is.  There it is. That must mean we're on.  We're on.  We're on.  Are they listening to the Bring Back Our Girls signs that are popping up all over the place?  No.  Are they paying attention?  It's more Coney shit.  We got all our big celebrities with their signs that they're holding up saying Bring Back Our Girls.  Till the next sign.  What do you think a hashtag with a sign is going to do to these fucking motherfuckers over there in Nigeria that are holding these girls? 
[00:00:30]  Nothing.  What? I thought they would release them immediately.  Michelle Obama held up the sign.  Bring Back Our Girls.  Hashtag. Oh, no.  It means nothing.  A whole bunch of A-listers are holding up the signs.  Bring Back Our Girls.  And what is that supposed to do?  Like, what is their education?  Like, so you find out about it.  We're finding out about it on the news.  Right.  I think a lot of people are aware of it. 
[00:01:00]  If they think it's going to spread awareness, that's stupid.  And if they think it's going to do anything to intimidate these people, you're thinking on a whole nother level.  What, they're not listening?  I don't think they're listening.  They're not listening.  No, the people...  What?  The frightening people with their AK-47s.  Oh, yeah.  I don't think they care about hashtags.  Are they laughing at the hashtag?  I bet they don't even know about the hashtag.  Oh, really?  I bet they're so far removed from what everyone thinks is activism here, that nothing happens. 
[00:01:30]  They're not feeling the hate from Twitter?  The hate?  They went into a town and pretty much killed every person in the town.  Just shot them to pieces.  But what about the signs?  The signs?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Our girls.  Bring back our girls.  There's 300 of these students, these girls.  Right.  They were taken captive by Islamic extremists in Nigeria.  Right.  And they've since divvied them up into different locations. 
[00:02:00]  Spread them out.  Spread them out.  They're saying they're going to sell them off to slavery.  Right.  Their whole gist is that they don't think their Islamic religion, you know, the religion of peace.  Right.  They don't believe that women have any need or want for education.  So shouldn't all the people that are holding up signs go look for them with compasses?  How about you go there?  With a compass.  At least that would be something.  Right.  You go to Nigeria.  I thought if you just held up a sign that said, bring back our girls, they would listen. 
[00:02:30]  They'd listen.  No, they're not listening.  This is that slacktivism we've talked about.  This people feeling like, I can do something.  I'm going to help.  Well, what should I do?  I don't know.  I can hold a piece of paper on the internet.  Didn't the Biebs hold up a sign?  Did the Biebs hold up one, too?  I know.  The Rock held up a sign.  The Rock held up a sign?  Sean Penn.  There's pictures of Sean Penn.  Real men don't buy girls.  Really?  Yeah.  What the hell is that about?  They almost commented until I realized what it was.  I was like, oh. 
[00:03:00]  They might be listening to that one.  No?  Nope.  Really?  Who are the other celebrities holding up the signs?  Oh.  Well, like you said, the First Lady of the Grand United States of America.  This isn't working.  Nigeria isn't even going above and beyond to try to take care of this problem themselves.  They should walk around with a sign in Nigeria that just says, do you know where our girls are?  Our girls are.  And just keep walking through these towns.  So someone goes, yes.  Right.  Over there. 
[00:03:30]  And then, you know, you try to, you know, get one back.  Yeah.  Chuck Schumer says.  Chuck Gay!  Chuck Gay!  He says that the United States ought to put up a reward for these girls.  Okay.  Like some kind of big cash reward.  And that they should give the person or persons asylum here in the United States that finds these girls.  That leads people to these girls.  So I guess he's trying something.  I don't know, you know.  That's a little better than just holding up a sign. 
[00:04:00]  And the people in Nigeria, there's just nothing going on.  They're like, there's really no military presence.  There's no this.  No one's really trying anything.  I guess right when this happened, the United States and Britain offered their assistance.  And Nigeria said, no.  Boo.  And that's kind of where it stands.  I don't see the signs helping, though.  I don't see the signs helping at all.  Well, that's too bad.  That's too bad.  I just thought with all the A-listers holding up the signs, we would have the girls back by now. 
[00:04:30]  Why don't they just have a peaceful talk?  Being the, you know, religion of peace.  They should be able to go to these Muslims and talk it out.  You know.  Oh, boy.  And I love how they try so hard, all these celebrities and everybody, to just steer away from the word Islamic.  They said extremist.  They've said that fanatical, everything but Islamic.  Oh, boy, are they petrified of that word.  They don't want to say Muslim.  They don't want to say Muslim. 
[00:05:00]  They don't want to say Muslim extremists.  Yeah, good luck finding them.  Wouldn't it be up to the Muslims to fix their own religion?  You would think.  And calm down the extreme branches of it?  The people that say that, hey, that's just a small batch of people, the extremists, the murderers.  Right.  How about those people try to open up a dialogue with the crazy Muslims and say, like, look, here's the deal.  We're peaceful people.  Right.  It's the religion of peace.  And then that would get more people to say, hey, look at that. 
[00:05:30]  Some Muslims are good and trying to rescue these people.  But that, for some reason, doesn't happen.  Right.  It's astounding.  I'm laughing because, oh, God.  Did you see the Michael Sam thing?  I was, like, off.  Are we allowed to comment that it was a little awkward to see him kissing his dude?  Oh, fuck.  That was.  I saw that.  Are we allowed to say that or is that bad?  You can say that.  You sure we're allowed to say that?  Because no one else is allowed to say that.  It was a strange new moment, let's say. 
[00:06:00]  I put it that way.  It was a very new moment for us.  And new things, being a human, when you see new things, you're a little taken aback just  to let it all soak in.  I didn't see the video.  I don't.  I have no problem with the gays.  I really don't.  I got gay friends.  You bet you do.  Right in this room, most likely.  I got so many gay friends.  I got them up the ass.  I think maybe in this room even.  I don't know. 
[00:06:30]  But with that said, I think even some of my gay friends.  Some.  I don't have a lot of gay friends.  Why am I trying to pump it up more than it is?  I think I have two.  I think I have two.  I do believe, I know them well enough, that they would be uncomfortable with this.  But you're not allowed to say that?  Apparently not.  If you comment, especially if you have any type of negative comment, you're done-scape.  And Michael Sam is a seventh-round draft pick.  They said that was almost embarrassing. 
[00:07:00]  Wasn't he like a unanimous All-American second defensive player of the year?  Yeah, but he didn't do well in the combine and all that.  That's where it matters.  And a lot of teams are very scared of drafting Michael Sam sooner because of what they saw.  Oh, boy.  And no player has gotten this much attention in the seventh round.  Just because of his sexual orientation, we all have to pay attention.  Is that his boyfriend right there?  There's been hundreds of gay people in the NFL. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Hundreds.  Sure.  If not in the thousands at this point.  Exactly.  But because he's the first openly gay player, we all have to give a shit.  Is he openly gay?  That was a hell of a smooch-a-rooney.  I jumped off the picture, but I didn't.  But you're not, I mean, we've got to at least acknowledge that you're not allowed to, you know, have a reaction to this.  No.  And this new, you know, this new day and age we live in, you're not supposed to react to this. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, that's the, like, you can accept something and still go, wow, that was a little uncomfortable or different to look at.  Exactly.  It doesn't mean that you don't like it or you're hateful.  It's just getting used to.  It takes some getting used to it.  Exactly.  We're going to need to see this at least 10,000 more times before we're used to it.  We're apparently supposed to do 10,000.  At least 10,000 times.  We're supposed to look at things as people now.  This is what we're supposed to do.  Look at things and be instantly accepting of it. 
[00:08:30]  And it's just not a human reaction.  How about you let us, like, soak this in a little bit.  Give us a little time.  Let it, you know, deaden the nerve a little by multiple viewings.  I would say in this day and age, anyone over the age of 30 needs a little time.  We need a little time.  We can't just shove this down our throats and go, oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  We've got to give us a little time.  That is some real talk right there. 
[00:09:00]  So could we set the scene here?  What is this?  They're at a house.  What is this?  Well, you know, these guys, it was the NFL draft was over the weekend.  And you've got the cameras all over the place.  And in this, you know, because it's Michael Sam, they've got a camera at his home waiting for him to be picked.  And the round, oh, boy, my phone's lit.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Or what did I say?  Boyfriend kiss.  Yeah, I know.  Okay.  Huh, huh, huh.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  I've got to turn this shit off.  All right.  Anyway, so. 
[00:09:30]  And then he's finally drafted by the Rams, which, you know, from a kid at heart made me chuckle.  The Ram.  The only team which would have been better would be the Packers, obviously.  Of course.  Let's make the jokes here.  Of course.  And don't go with the tight end wide receiver joke, please.  All right.  That's been done a million fucking times.  Sometimes you've got to be a little more clever, a little more creative with your jokes.  I hope he did that joke.  Right.  Jesus.  Right.  So he got picked by the Rams, and then the reaction was very emotional.  Very emotional and very, you know, very nice. 
[00:10:00]  Very nice.  There's some love in the room.  Just two loving men.  Right.  Congratulating.  And by the way, this video leads to our first apology of the day.  All right.  If you think we're going 10 days without an apology, you're crazy.  We can't go two.  It's amazing.  No.  On the Opie and Anthony show, we're trying to go 10 days without an apology.  Guess what?  Today, we have five.  Five apologies.  We have five apologies since Friday's show.  Five.  Since Friday's show. 
[00:10:30]  It's crazy.  Alert the media.  Opie and Anthony are trying to go 10 fucking days without an apology.  It's astounding.  Five.  And there could have been a six, but Charles Barkley basically told San Antonio and everyone  else to go fuck themselves.  Which is fantastic.  I can't wait to hear that.  It's an amazing video.  It's what everyone should be saying.  Great.  Even Donald Sterling.  Donald Sterling should go, look, I'm 80-something years old.  I grew up in a time where there were separate water fountains.  Yeah.  I need some time to figure this shit out. 
[00:11:00]  He's trying to bring them back.  God, all you have to do is hang out with your grandma, your grandpa, and you realize they  came from a different time.  Are you kidding me?  They can't figure out smartphones, and they can't figure out this shit yet.  I have my jitterbug phone.  You're right.  All right.  Here you go.  All right.  Here it is.  Michael Sam got drafted by the Rams.  Camera's on him.  Go back a little bit.  What happened?  A little bit.  How did I see him hugging?  Hold on. 
[00:11:30]  What?  Sam?  It's about to Sam.  You got to go with the whole...  It's about to Sam.  It's about to Sam.  It makes you nervous?  He wasn't picked yet.  No, he just got picked, but he isn't...  It makes you nervous?  Well, they're in mid-embrace.  I want to see how the embrace started.  Sam, what are you about to Sam?  That's the fun part.  They're all watching TV.  We got four hours to kill.  Yeah, this is like the dialogue.  We can play the whole NFL draft.  He's crying.  Yeah, but you're only showing it because he's openly gay. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, that...  Wow.  It's like a heavy gravy. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, look.  They're clenched hands.  Finger in between finger handholds they have going there.  His little boyfriend is embracing him, laying his head on his giant back.  His boyfriend's crying, too.  Where are they?  Home.  Oh, it's the house.  Oh.  Yes, sir. 
[00:13:00]  All right.  Oh, there it is.  Woo.  Look, the camera even fucked up.  The camera couldn't even take it.  It glitched.  There they go.  There's a big hug and kisses.  See?  Mmm.  Wow.  You're not allowed to have that reaction, Anthony.  Holy mo...  Oh, boy.  Oh, a bunch of kisses.  Oh, this is just kissy face city. 
[00:13:30]  Jesus Christ.  I don't know.  That's...  That's what...  Wow.  That's fine.  Did you guys see the part where...  It was like me and Jimmy after you got your last special.  Absolutely.  And before it.  Did we see what, Travis?  Where he puts cake in his boyfriend's face.  What's that about?  And they kiss some more.  Oh.  What?  Are they killing that?  It's just...  It's a good time all the way around.  Oh, boy. 
[00:14:00]  It kiss a lot.  It's a good time all around.  They want to...  You guys are liars.  These jock sports announcers and stuff that are commentating on this are so dishonest.  I mean, they're just so dishonest.  I think there's a way to be accepting and also have a real reaction to all that.  Like, holy fuck.  Right.  You know?  Right.  I really think there's a balance there.  They're all lying.  Yeah.  Some of them at ESPN and these other sports places absolutely felt a little uncomfortable 
[00:14:30]  seeing that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But they probably are accepting as well.  Oh, God.  But who got in trouble?  One of the Miami Dolphins players?  Yeah.  And that leads to our first apology?  Did he officially apologize?  Is he on the apology list?  Yeah, he is, right?  Is that the Don Jones thing?  So that happened, and it leads us to our first apology.  So we already set the apology clock.  That's, um... 
[00:15:00]  Who's the boyfriend, by the way?  Wow.  Any word?  Some stud.  He's some...  No, he's kind of a little white guy.  Right.  That's one of those deals where...  Hopefully this is the last time we...  It's like, Dad, there's good news and bad news.  You said it perfectly before.  And the good news is I'm gay.  Because, wow, it's like you're bringing home a very large man.  He's a football player, Pop.  It's got to be difficult, right?  Yeah.  Come out like that?  Depends on what his dad is like, but yes. 
[00:15:30]  I don't either.  Well...  I would assume it's probably a difficult thing for a gay man to come out to his father.  Look, you know, we bitch about this place a lot, but what we just did is completely acceptable  here at SiriusXM.  They allow us to speak our minds.  Yeah.  I want to acknowledge that.  Because other people had the same exact reaction we did.  That's why I just played this for everybody that way.  Because Don Jones probably had a very similar reaction, and now he's in all sorts of fucking  trouble, and he doesn't even play for the Rams. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, my God.  He plays for the Dolphins.  You could be accepting, but also have an uncomfortable feeling seeing that.  Plus the fact...  I'm not used to it.  He was drafted in the seventh round.  Name one other football player that was drafted in the seventh round.  This year.  Oh, this year.  Or any year.  You don't know those players.  Dick Butkus.  Dick Butkus. 
[00:16:30]  Emerson Boozer.  Anyway, Don Jones apologizes for tweet.  The Miami Dolphins have fined second-year defensive back Don Jones.  You hear that?  Find him.  An undisclosed amount, and excuse him from the team following critical remarks towards  Michael Sam, who recently became the first openly gay athlete drafted by the NFL.  Would you like to know the critical remarks from Don Jones?  Excuse him from the team?  Yeah.  They fired him?  No, they're just putting him on the sidelines.  On the sidelines. 
[00:17:00]  He's not allowed to participate right now until he learns his lesson.  Jones took to Twitter Saturday soon after Sam was drafted and tweeted, these are the critical remarks.  Are you ready?  Hold on.  OMG.  Oh, my God.  And horrible.  Horrible.  He later deleted those tweets.  Uh-oh.  What was the horrible part, though?  The kiss?  The kiss was horrible.  Yeah.  He said that was horrible.  All that cake in the face.  Jones met with the Dolphins brass about his comments Sunday before the team ruled on his punishment.  He must undergo educational training before he can return to the Dolphins, according to the team. 
[00:17:30]  He's in a sport where they're basically killing each other on a daily basis.  Right.  Or, you know, cutting their life expectancies drastically from all the head injuries and everything else that happens to these poor guys.  Jones met with the Dolphins brass.  Okay.  Jones apologized to Sam in his first public comments about the situation.  So here's your first apology.  I want to apologize to Michael Sam for the inappropriate comments that I made last night on social media, Jones said. 
[00:18:00]  I take full responsibility for them, and I regret that these tweets took away from his draft moment.  I remember last year when I was drafted in the seventh round.  Oh, okay.  He was a seventh-round draft choice.  Oh, there you go.  And all of the emotions and happiness I felt when I received the call that gave me an opportunity to play for an NFL team,  and I wish him all the best in his NFL career.  Great lawyer statement.  He was forced to lie, basically.  You're forced to lie now.  Exactly.  Do you think a lawyer wrote that for him? 
[00:18:30]  Oh, Jesus.  Legal eagle.  Everyone is forced to lie so they are, you know, put in line.  This is, you ever read 1984 and that whole part of the book where it's like you have to, they won't just kill you if you're a fucking, you know, an outcast.  Right.  Somebody that doesn't agree with the whole system.  They want you to really, honestly love the whole big brother thing before they kill you.  Right. 
[00:19:00]  So you're reprogrammed, even though they're going to eliminate you, but there's something in the fact that you need to assimilate before they kill you.  That's exactly what this sensitivity training is.  It's like, it can't possibly work.  1984 is one of the greatest books ever written.  Oh, my goodness.  And boy, did it foreshadow what we are becoming.  What year was that book?  It was 83.  1983.  No, it was way the fuck before 1984.  See, you read it now and then you almost say, ah, what's the big deal? 
[00:19:30]  You know, but you got to understand when this was written, none of this shit was going on yet.  Manipulation of the media and the government and the media being one.  And everyone watching each other.  Everyone's watching.  And tattling on each other.  When you first watched that movie or you read the book.  I never saw the movie.  The movie was a little slow.  But when you first read the book, the thing that got you and the thing about this big brother thing was that there was no real way to pay attention to what everyone's saying. 
[00:20:00]  Like, you were like, look, I could go in my fucking room.  I could say things.  I could write things.  I could keep secrets.  I could do that.  And then you realize, like, there's no way they could keep tabs on you.  But now they can.  Right.  It happened.  It really happened.  I sincerely apologize to Mr. Stephen Ross.  48, by the way.  48 or published in 49.  49?  Yeah.  1949.  I didn't know it was that early.  Wow. 
[00:20:30]  That was someone that really picked up on that whole fucking...  We didn't even know if TVs were going to be...  Communist United States against the Communist thing.  Is that when that was happening?  McCarthyism and stuff?  A lot of paranoia going on post...  Was McCarthyism after that or no?  Oh, yeah.  But it was post-war, kind of the divvying up of Europe and everything.  We didn't even know if TVs were going to hit in 1949.  And that's pretty key to 1984.  Yeah, yeah.  I sincerely apologize.  This is Don Jones' apology, which continues.  I sincerely apologize to Mr. Stephen Ross, my teammates. 
[00:21:00]  Who's Mr. Stephen Ross?  Does anyone know?  Travis?  Is that the boyfriend?  I don't know, maybe.  My teammates, coaches, staff, and fans of these tweets.  I am committed to represent the value of the Miami Dolphins organization.  I appreciate the opportunity I have been given to do so going forward.  Who's Stephen Ross, Sam?  I think he's the owner.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  We were disappointed to read Don's tweets during the NFL draft.  Dolphins head coach Joe Phillip in a statement. 
[00:21:30]  They were inappropriate and unacceptable, and we regret the negative impact these comments  had on such an important weekend for the NFL.  We met with Don today about respect, discrimination, and judgment.  These comments are not consistent with the values and standards of our program.  We will continue to emphasize and educate our players that these statements will not be tolerated.  What was that for?  What was that apology for?  It's like, just insert it into any situation. 
[00:22:00]  It's the same one.  We are sincerely.  Horrible.  Horrible.  Sincerely.  Horrible.  God.  So that was huge over the weekend, obviously, huh?  All right.  There's one away.  Let's say hi to Mike in Staten Island.  Mike.  Gentlemen, I just wanted you to know that if you don't know already, the picture of them  kissing was on the front page and the back page of the New York Daily News yesterday,  and I apologize for anything I was thinking about. 
[00:22:30]  Apologize for thinking about it, yeah.  Well, the papers are smart.  They know that'll get people talking.  Yeah.  They didn't put it on their front pages and back pages saying, look at this wonderful moment.  No.  They knew that would get people talking.  That it was a shock.  It was there for shock value also.  Right.  Shock value.  There's such a taboo thing that goes into that picture.  There's a lot of little taboos that are being broken there in that picture. 
[00:23:00]  And just to look at it as a heterosexual male, you look at it and go like, wow, that's  really kind of, I gotta look at this picture.  But a lot of times seeing a heterosexual couple kiss is a little awkward, you know, when they  do that in public or whatever as well.  Yeah.  For real.  Yeah.  But this is not something we've seen a lot.  So, of course, you're going to have a reaction to it. 
[00:23:30]  Interracial man-on-man kiss on national television.  It's, you know.  On ESPN.  You get taken aback a bit, you know.  The interracial shit used to be magic versus bird.  On ESPN.  On ESPN.  That's not as interracial as they got.  That's how they, that's exactly how interracial they used to get.  So, give us some time.  We come from the magic Johnson bird era.  There are people that saw this and actually had to pick up their Bible and talk to it. 
[00:24:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, Lord Jesus Christ.  What's happening, Jesus?  Oh, Lord.  Oh, Jesus.  The gay thing definitely dropped his draft stock.  He was, all right.  See, because we don't know as much about this shit.  Snowy in Michigan.  But, Snowy, his numbers were shit in the combine, I thought.  Well, I don't know about it.  I mean, I can't say I know everything, but he was a co-defensive player of the year in  his conference.  Right.  I'm sure, I mean, I'm not saying he would have gone in the first and second round, but 
[00:24:30]  I think it's a good chance he may have won five or six, being a co-defensive player.  And he didn't, he announced it to his team he was gay before the season started and kept  it private.  So, it wasn't like they gave him co-defensive player of the year.  Oh, look, he came out as gay.  It wasn't the end of the season.  Right.  He earned that.  He obviously earned that.  And you're saying he should have been drafted higher.  No, I'm just saying, I'm sure it affected his draft stock a little bit.  Because some people don't want to take that on.  It's like, ah, do we really want to bring it on and kind of bring the whole shit to something 
[00:25:00]  that could come about with this?  And if we caught him, they'll say we caught him because he was gay.  And, you know, I'm sure some teams didn't want to take that on.  They said he's a small, like the combine, they said he was a smaller player than, um,  that he's in that weird thing where he's not heavy enough or not tall enough, but he's...  He brings up a great point, though, there, right at the end of that, what he just said.  What?  The fact that if a team has to let him go, there's that liability that he's going to go,  you're letting me go because I'm gay, starts a whole big fucking legal issue. 
[00:25:30]  So maybe teams are like, look, we don't want to deal with that in the first place.  So it was a preemptive little strike here.  Fuck him.  We're not going to take him on.  That could be a very real possibility.  Yeah, where the wrong guy says the wrong thing in the locker room.  Right, now you've got a fucking whole issue, a whole new issue.  Oh, boy.  All right, let me go to Frank in Philly.  Frank.  Frank in Philly.  Good morning.  Good morning.  There was another Miami Dolphins apology on Thursday night. 
[00:26:00]  They drafted their player.  I don't know who it was.  But Mike Pouncey, one of the current Dolphins, decided to tweet that he could not wait for his gifts and presents from the new draft pick after the whole issue they just had last season with the guy being bullied.  I missed this.  I did, too.  Oh, yeah.  It was Mike Pouncey.  He tweeted it. 
[00:26:30]  Did he delete it and apologize?  Yeah, I think he did apologize.  I'm not sure.  But the owner of the Dolphins once again came out and said he was disappointed in the situation.  And this does not represent the whole Dolphins team.  It was kind of amusing.  But the Dolphins are lying.  Oh, absolutely.  They're lying in this apology here.  Yeah.  There are players on the team that are still uncomfortable with the gay. 
[00:27:00]  They have fans that are uncomfortable with it still.  There's people in the front office that are uncomfortable with it still.  You don't want the hate being spewed.  But I think it's okay for people to be uncomfortable with this still.  Apparently not.  Apparently not.  It does represent the Miami Dolphins.  There's a percentage of your fan base that are uncomfortable with this.  These horrible statements do not represent the fine, outstanding. 
[00:27:30]  We've worked with many gay organizations over the years.  Remember they just pile on an apology, everything they've done?  Right.  Oh, man.  That is a...  That's only the first apology, so...  Pretty disturbing, though.  Look at his little white arms around that giant black shoulders.  I mean, it really is a very...  I mean, you could kind of... 
[00:28:00]  I don't know.  Eminem's apologizing to his mom in a video?  This is how bad the apology culture has gotten?  That's somebody who probably owes one.  He said a lot of awful shit about his mother.  He said a few things over the years.  Yeah.  Why is he...  What is he doing?  This is a new song.  He needs a little attention.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's like, oh...  I think they're going to change the name of Shade 45 soon.  To what?  I don't know.  I mean, you know, when they made Shade 45, it was because Eminem was hot. 
[00:28:30]  Ja Rule, maybe.  He's a hot rapper.  Yeah, let's go with Ja Rule.  It's a bad idea.  No.  No, he just put out a new song where he's apologizing.  He's, you know...  He's empathizing when he's forgiving and apologizing.  How is the song?  It's just like any other Eminem song.  Oh, forget it then.  Chris in North Carolina.  Chris.  Hey, Ope.  Hey, buddy.  I just want to tell you guys about the best part of 1984 that you missed out on.  In 1984, the main character, there's three countries, and he's in one country, and he's  always told that the other country they're aligned with and the third country they're 
[00:29:00]  against.  Right.  And he's always told this time and time again.  And then at some point, they just switch it around and say, now we're against the first  country and we're allied with the second country.  And they're basically manipulating their minds so they have no idea who their true enemy  is out in the world.  Yeah.  And that's happening today.  Our government is constantly sort of rerouting what we think is good and bad, or who is the  good guy and who's the bad guy.  Yeah.  You could really pick it apart and probably take every instance of government deceit in 
[00:29:30]  1984 and peg it to something that's going on today.  It's almost laid out like a free book.  Yeah.  I was going to say I'm going to have to read the book, but I'll just watch the movie.  Well, I'll read the book.  The guy was in it that got the alien ripped out of his stomach, an alien.  Ah.  He's the main guy.  What's his name?  Exactly.  Okay.  That guy.  I'm going to tell you.  No actors.  He was in that other movie.  Yeah.  That's him.  What's his name?  I don't know. 
[00:30:00]  We're going to take a break.  We got Donald Sterling.  We got at least four more apologies as we reset the apology clock back to zero.  Already.  Already.  Hell of a world.  Charles Barkley clips, too.  The Charles Barkley thing is one of the greatest things.  Yeah.  He's a real man.  He's a TV in many, many years.  He's a real man.  And everyone should pay attention to that.  And you should have went to Twitter right after he did that.  People loved it.  That's what the people want.  Yes.  They don't want all this apologizing crap. 
[00:30:30]  They just don't want it.  But all these pussy boys on all these other networks, you know, can't get in front of  a camera quick enough to apologize.  Oh.  Bother.  The Joan Rivers one especially still bothers me.  They apologize for Joan Rivers.  Yeah.  So, all right.  We'll eat some food and we'll get into some more stuff.  Oh.  Excuse me.  ...where to keep the body moving.  Muscles use chemical energy and this requires a pretty constant input. 
[00:31:00]  Viruses are net consumers of energy.  A virus by itself cannot generate energy.  So, if you wake up tomorrow in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, hold yourself up for  a while until they all run out of brains to eat and they'll just fall down eventually.  This is why I think 28 Days Later series was the most realistic of all the recent zombie  movies and why the book World War Z wins the unrealistic award for its horde of immortal  undersea undead walkers. 
[00:31:30]  Barring a virus or a toxin, the only other explanation that bears scrutiny is something  supernatural.  And you don't believe in magic anymore, do you?  Be sure to check out Weird Medicine Saturdays at 10 p.m. Eastern right here on the Opie and  Anthony Channel.  The Opie and the show is back on Sirius XR.  The Exile of Main Street 42 years ago today. 
[00:32:00]  I hit that one, by the way.  For the record.  A little happy.  We have a lot of Stones things on this, like, break, too. 
[00:32:30]  When we talk about, like, what happened in 40-some-odd years ago.  It's usually, like, the Stones, U2, the Beatles.  The Beatles.  That's about it.  The Zeppelin.  Van Halen.  Van Halen, yeah.  Van Halen.  Yeah.  If you want a weird one, Billy Squire.  Weird.  What?  Lonely is the Night.  What was the big one?  Snoke.  Snoke.  Snoke.  Snoke.  Snoke.  Snoke.  Snoke. 
[00:33:00]  Snoke.  Right.  And then there's the Christmas one he did.  Christmas is the time to say.  I love you.  Right?  That one?  They're saying he's 64 today.  That just doesn't seem right.  Yeah.  I guess he was a bit older than everyone else when MTV hit.  I think he was in his, yeah, early 30s.  Early 30s when everyone else was kind of in their early 20s or so.  Uh-huh.  That doesn't seem right that Billy Squire is 64 years old, but all right.  All right. 
[00:33:30]  A lot of rumors about his mysteriousness over the years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the NFL should draft him and then we'll find out.  Find out.  Big smooch.  Big smooches.  Is it too late for the NFL to draft him so we can find out?  Cameras in his home.  Here he is and, oh yeah, there it is.  In the 48th round.  It's just great.  Those sportscasters just, uh, what a great moment. 
[00:34:00]  What a, like, it's not even acknowledging.  Yeah.  Like, what we know they're thinking.  Right.  Everyone's just petrified.  Like, well, that's, at least, you know, well, there's something you don't see every day.  And I don't want to see it, Bob.  Well, we got Irish underscore Tommy 81.  He knows a little more.  That's why I like the Twitter.  He says, uh, Michael Sam.  Statistically, Sam had one of the worst combines out of any player.  Okay.  And then he has an article that kind of shows, uh, that point. 
[00:34:30]  And then he goes on and says, Max Bulla.  I don't know this guy.  Not gay.  From Michigan State.  Was known as one of the best defensive players in the NCAA.  He wasn't even drafted.  Not gay.  And then he continues again.  And he says, Ron Jaworski on SportsCenter Sunday said, Michael Sam is average and one-dimensional.  And that's why he was drafted in the seventh round.  So it wasn't because, you know, he was, uh, gay that he was drafted so late.  A lot of people can still speculate.  So.  Just more info on the whole thing. 
[00:35:00]  That's all.  Yeah.  Uh.  All right.  Donald Sterling.  Yeah.  What's going on?  Is this the fake tape by his friend?  Yeah.  Okay.  Womp.  You heard about Donald Sterling.  Another tape was released.  Yeah.  And it's so fake.  It was so set up.  Totally fake.  Yes.  How did it, how was it faked?  Fake voice.  And all of a sudden they said, oh, look at another Donald Sterling tape.  It hits the media.  Oh.  And I guess Sterling did it with one of his friends. 
[00:35:30]  Has a goof.  Well, even on the tape, he's like, oh, no one's going to hear this.  To kind of, like, help, help the fact that he was secretly taped again.  Wait, wait.  It's so obvious.  Is this him trying to stay out of, like, trouble?  Did they think people were going to buy this?  This is to kind of, you know, counterbalance all the other tapes.  Oh, okay.  They put out a fake tape?  This is a fake tape.  I didn't read it a lot.  Who did he talk to, Sam?  You know offhand?  No, they didn't say in the article.  Just one of his friends. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  Yuck.  This is really uncomfortable.  But, I mean, you know, he's trying to save his property there.  Do you have that check for the NAACP that I just made out for a million dollars?  You might as well do.  Because I love black people.  Right.  There's nothing worse than an old person trying to use new technology.  Oh, yeah.  Thinking they can fool the people.  Well, let's listen to the tape.  All right.  Maybe it's real.  You decide if this is a real tape that was leaked.  All right.  But I'm talking to a girl. 
[00:36:30]  I'm trying to have sex with her.  I'm trying to play with her.  Ew.  We're going to turn this thing around.  Keep your chin up.  Keep your chin up.  He sounds like a Daryl Hammond impression.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What can you, you know, if you ever have sex with a girl and you're talking to her privately,  you don't think anybody's there.  You may say anything in the world.  What difference does it make? 
[00:37:00]  That was his bedroom talk.  Yeah, exactly.  He's saying, you might as well have sex with her.  He would say anything.  I hate black people.  Does that turn you on?  You getting all immersed?  Then if the girl tapes it and releases it, my God, it's awful.  Joel, all the ministers will, careful.  Who thinks anybody's going to tape something? 
[00:37:30]  What the hell?  I'm talking to a girl.  The girl's black.  I like her.  I'm jealous that she's with other black guys.  I want her.  So what the hell can I, in private, tell her?  You know, I don't want you to be with anybody.  I mean, do I have, can I, am I a person?  Do I have any freedom of speech?  I wish Magic Johnson was talking to a girl.  And you're trying to play with her.  And you might say anything. 
[00:38:00]  You may say you have the biggest penis in the world.  I would have said I could fly over a high-rise building if I had to.  And you're talking to her.  Then you go away.  And the next thing, three months later, what you said when you were hot trying to get at her is released.  Is the other guy's voice on this?  No.  What fucking nonsense.  I wanted to play with her.  What a creep.  How hateable is this?  I hate him more for this tape than the first one. 
[00:38:30]  I don't know.  What a creep.  Adam Sandler.  Yeah, it's old Adam Sandler.  I have a girl here who has black kids and is partly black, I think, myself.  I love the girl.  And so she's telling me, you're wrong.  I know I'm wrong.  What I said was wrong.  But I never thought the private conversation would go anywhere out to the public. 
[00:39:00]  I didn't want her to bring anybody to my game because I was jealous.  I mean, I'm being honest.  And it doesn't matter.  No one's going to hear it but you and me, so.  Oh.  Yuck.  And the other guy never talks?  No.  Because there isn't another guy.  It's just him recording himself.  No one's ever going to hear.  I think it was his idea and everyone had to go with it.  I don't know if you want to do that. 
[00:39:30]  Right.  Oh, this is great.  I'll talk like I do for some.  I'll explain myself.  Like it's candid.  I don't know.  Oh.  I mean, they kept saying that it was his girlfriend.  But was it his girlfriend?  I don't know.  He was trying to play with her.  That wasn't a guy trying to get laid.  Yeah, you're buying her.  That was a guy possibly talking after he got laid.  You know what I mean?  In the kitchen the next morning or something.  That wasn't someone trying to get in. 
[00:40:00]  You know what?  Why would he buy her fucking Ferraris and all that stuff?  He hadn't fucked her.  Well, you've got to take it all on a relative scale.  He's a fucking billionaire.  Buying a chick a Ferrari is nothing if you're trying to fuck her.  Maybe.  But then I'm like, there's been these rumors that she's transsexual.  And they're only rumors.  But is she?  Who knows?  Because if she is.  It's a big if.  But I wonder if she is.  She's got a few man features.  Is there her hands?  There's a few things I look at.  There's a few man features. 
[00:40:30]  Usually I hear that and I'm like, no, it's just a girl who looks a little bit.  She's kooky too.  Boy.  But I wonder if, like, say they had sex.  Let's just say she's trans and they had sex.  Maybe he's trying to spin it like, now he's got to put a thing like, we never had sex.  Because then there's that element that he knows might come out.  That's, what, the old penis?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Just a guess.  That was one of many Donald Sterling things that came about since our last radio show together.  Then he went on with Anderson Cooper, I believe, right? 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anderson Cooper.  And I guess this leads to apology number two.  As we try to go ten days without an apology, Donald Sterling has now apologized officially as well.  Yes.  As you will see in this bit of audio.  It's on and on.  So he talked to Anderson Cooper from CNN.  The problem.  I don't know how, you know, and I'm asking for forgiveness.  Am I entitled to?  Go back to the beginning.  Yeah, no problem.  A member who made a mistake, and I'm apologizing, and I'm asking for forgiveness. 
[00:41:30]  Am I entitled to one mistake?  Am I, after 35 years, I mean, I love my league.  I love my partner.  Am I entitled to one mistake?  It's a terrible mistake.  And I'll never do it again.  The vice president of the NBA Players Association, Roger Mason, he said that the players won't  accept anyone in the Sterling family owning the Clippers.  Not you, not your wife, not your son-in-law, not your daughter.  Do you believe that?  I really don't know. 
[00:42:00]  The people that are going to decide my fate, I think, are not the media, and not the players'  union, but the NBA.  The owners.  Pardon me?  The owners.  The owners.  If the owners feel I deserve another chance, then they'll give it to me.  But there is a path for you to fight their decision, isn't there?  Of course.  But if you fight with my partners, what, at the end of the road, what do I benefit? 
[00:42:30]  Especially at my age.  If they fight with me and they spend millions and I spend millions, let's say I win or they  win, I just don't know if that's important.  Why wait so long to apologize?  It's been a couple of weeks.  You could have come out.  That's a very good question.  I just, I'm so emotionally distraught. 
[00:43:00]  And the reason it's hard for me, very hard for me, is that I'm wrong.  I caused the problem.  I don't know how to correct it.  Do you trust people?  I mean, there have been a couple of phone recordings just in the last week or two that have come  out of people you've talked to on the phone, or it seems to be your voice, who then sold  it to, you know, Radar Online or TMZ.  Not him.  And I hear that and I think, do you have anyone you trust around you?  I don't give interviews. 
[00:43:30]  The only one that I know that I talked to is Magic Johnson.  You have talked to him?  Twice.  And then, yeah, he's...  Did you apologize?  He knew the girl, he said.  He knew the girl well.  Did you apologize to him?  Well, if I said anything wrong, I'm sorry.  He's a good person and he...  What am I going to say? 
[00:44:00]  Has he done everything he can do to help minorities?  I don't think so.  I'll say it.  I'll say it, you know.  He's great.  But I just don't think he is a good example for the children of Los Angeles.  I'm not a racist.  Hold on.  He just doesn't know when to stop.  What a dumb twat.  How is he not a good example?  LA loves Michael. 
[00:44:30]  Magic Johnson.  Magic Johnson, excuse me.  Loves him.  He just can't hold it in.  He came out with AIDS 20 years ago, HIV, and he's fucking lived a productive life and  he's showing that you don't have to give up and he's an entrepreneur.  Right.  He's talking about...  Anyone else hear that in there?  He was hinting that Magic Johnson knows that girl.  Yeah, yeah.  There was a little something to that.  Look out, you might get the AIDS.  But he was hinting like he knows her.  Yeah.  Well, what does that mean? 
[00:45:00]  Wow, man.  Keep going.  He can't accept blame for himself, though.  He's got to be like, well, Magic Johnson's not that.  Magic Johnson's an asshole.  Right.  He's trying to keep it calm.  He's ready to, like, throw everyone under the bus.  Oh, yeah.  He probably will if he officially loses the team.  He'll have some things to say.  I made a terrible, terrible mistake.  And I'm here with you today to apologize and to ask for forgiveness for all the people 
[00:45:30]  that I've hurt.  And I've hurt so many people, so many innocent people.  Have you?  And I've hurt myself.  Oh.  You know?  Comes back to him.  I spoke to a girl that I was fond of.  When I listened to that tape, I don't even know how I could say words like that.  And I'm so sorry.  And I'm so apologetic.  This is so insincere.  It's ridiculous.  What a disingenuous old twat this guy is.  I'm sorry.  I hurt. 
[00:46:00]  I'm so sincerely apologizing.  He is not sincerely apologizing for anything.  He's delusional.  I've hurt myself.  Me, me, me.  How do you make it about you?  He can't do anything else but make it about him.  This whole apology is about him.  Everything he does is about him.  That's it.  Anderson Cooper is not a great interviewer either.  He just sits there and listens too much sometimes.  All right?  With this guy, though, you just want him to talk. 
[00:46:30]  I guess.  You just want this guy to fucking yap.  Yeah, I don't know.  Anderson's not really adding much to this, though.  Go ahead there, Sammy.  What are you sorry about?  Well, I'm sorry that so many people are hurt.  I never dreamt that this could happen.  It's a terrible, terrible nightmare.  My players, they didn't need this.  They didn't need this cloud over their head.  And they're good people.  And I love them and I respect them. 
[00:47:00]  And I would always be there for them.  He's whining.  To hear that I'm a possible racist is so painful to me.  Because I'm not a racist.  And I've never been a racist.  It's not me.  When you saw them take off where their warm-up jerseys reversed and the name Clippers wasn't in that first game, what did you think?  I really didn't pay attention to that.  They are Clippers.  And they're mine.  And I'm theirs.  That's how I feel.  I would do anything for them.  I made a mistake.  I hope it's in their heart to forgive me for that mistake. 
[00:47:30]  I don't know why the girl had me say those things.  You're saying he was sad.  The girl had me say those things.  Oh my God.  She just won't take responsibility for the fact that he said it.  I love it.  I love it.  I don't know why she made me say those things.  What a fucking doddering old annoying man.  This is classic.  Almost done.  I mean, it's not the way I talk.  I don't talk about people for one thing, ever.  I talk about ideas and other things, but I don't talk about people. 
[00:48:00]  What?  Do you know how the tape got released?  No.  Do you think she did it?  It's, I don't know.  I mean, an 80-year-old man is kind of foolish, and I'm kind of foolish.  I thought she liked me and really cared for me.  I guess being 50 years, 51 years older than her, I was deluding myself.  Do you trust her now?  No, I don't trust her, and I just wish I could ask her.  These are dumb questions. 
[00:48:30]  Why?  And if she was just setting me up, I think that people say she was taping me for two years.  So maybe I was just fooling myself thinking for two years that she cared for me.  She certainly acted like it.  Yeah, Cooper with softball questions.  How can you pretend you didn't fuck her after two years?  Right.  That's fucking great.  Yeah.  He should have, like, tried to find out exactly what type of relationship he had with this woman.  The things she made me say. 
[00:49:00]  Right.  What?  We still don't know what kind of relationship they had.  Well, magic knew her.  That doesn't kill my other theory.  No.  Oh, right.  No, there was something in the way he said that.  I was like, uh-huh, uh-huh.  You would think at this point someone would release to the news that if she had a cock.  Yeah, you'd probably.  Yeah.  You'd probably think.  She's got a...  In celebration.  Yes, of course. 
[00:49:30]  A celebratory news press conference.  Well, Charles Barkley.  Yeah.  We move on to Charles Barkley now.  He, uh, he had two hot things over the weekend.  Uh-huh.  He commented about this interview.  He did.  Oh, boy, did he.  You want to hear that first?  Sure.  Okay.  This is Charles Barkley.  He's the man.  Charles Barkley's the man.  See Anderson Cooper's exclusive interview with Donald Sterling starting tomorrow at 6 a.m.  on CNN's New Day, and then the full interview on Anderson Cooper 360 tomorrow night, 8 o'clock 
[00:50:00]  on CNN.  I'm glad we got to work tomorrow night because we don't have to watch that junk.  We got games tomorrow night.  I love it.  You know, he was honored that junk.  All right.  He's got to know.  He's got to know.  They're going to the bumper music.  That's hilarious.  Mike's probably live. 
[00:50:30]  Of course.  And then, uh, that leads to what Charles Barkley did last night.  Uh, last we left you, he made fun of, um, women in San Antonio being big.  Yeah.  Big and fat.  Yep.  Fat chicks.  Fat chicks.  And then, uh, I think a couple fat groups, uh, stepped forward.  We're like, we demand an apology from Charles Barkley, blah, blah, blah.  They lumbered forward.  Yeah.  Uh, they stood up for a half a second and sat back down immediately and made their statement. 
[00:51:00]  If you didn't hear the original comments from Barkley, it was just hilarious.  He was just having fun.  Um, and the guys at the table were enjoying the hell out of it because Charles Barkley  has no problem.  He doesn't have much of a filter.  It's guys having fun.  Right.  So, uh, this is what Charles Barkley said last night as far as the situation goes and everyone  wondering if he was going to apologize for making fun of the women in San Antonio.  We got a minute.  Can I say something?  Yeah.  That's why you're here.  Okay.  You know, I've heard from some complaints from the people of San Antonio. 
[00:51:30]  Why would that be?  Let me just say this.  I heard they were talking about us on some stupid show called The Talk the other day.  I don't know what that is.  I heard that, uh, some idiot in San Antonio started a blog.  Let me just say.  What's the blog?  I don't know.  Okay.  Listen, I'm just going to have fun on TV.  You know, I'm joking.  I say San Antonio got a great organization.  They got the best point guard.  They got the greatest power for it ever. 
[00:52:00]  Some of you people don't like my sense of humor is what I got to say.  Turn off your damn television.  I'm not going to change.  If you don't like me or the show, turn it off.  And they want me to apologize.  That's not going to happen.  That's not going to happen.  Me joking about those big old women down in San Antonio.  Good for him.  And they're all laughing.  They're like, ah, look at him.  That's the only sports show where men are acting like the way men want to act.  You know, joking around and shit.  You've got to watch how hard Shaq laughs.  And you've got to watch the way the other co-hosts, I don't know who that is. 
[00:52:30]  Well, Shaq appreciates a good, you know, retard face.  So, of course, he's going to laugh.  Of course, he's going to laugh at this.  And he has fucking retired player money, so he doesn't get anything.  And the other co-host keeps egging Charles on the same way he was in the first clip.  In the first, yeah.  Trying to get him to say if San Antonio women are fat.  Right.  This is how...  He's the best. 
[00:53:00]  Choros.  Choros on the house.  Choros.  Choros.  There you go.  That's all you have to say.  Oh, is that fucking funny, man?  I'm having fun on TV.  I'm having fun on the radio.  Big old women.  Yeah, we're trying to make people laugh. 
[00:53:30]  They're trying to, you know, have fun on TV and make people laugh.  Forever.  As long as you have their company backing you up like that.  Like, they're not going to throw them under the bus.  That's hilarious.  It's great.  Do we have the clip of the talk talking about Charles Barkley making fun of fat people in San Antonio?  Oh, God.  That just sounds like awful.  That sounds horrible.  The talk.  Here it is.  I gotta...  Fat joke's gone too far?  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  They got a beach ball.  Every, like, women's show has to have a beach ball. 
[00:54:00]  That looks like Snipes in that fucking movie where you dress like a chick.  She looks like Wesley Snipes.  Yes.  That chick is Wesley Snipes, motherfucker.  That's great.  The talk is just...  This thing is a horrendous show, by the way.  Mm-hmm.  Go ahead.  Sounds like I need to start a new organization.  1-800-REN-A-FAT-GIRL.  Maybe I need to start a new organization.  All right.  All right.  She's going to be fun of herself a little bit.  I don't know.  Maybe I see.  I know that I am, for my body size and my height, I am fat. 
[00:54:30]  So, but I didn't take offense, because you ain't talking to me.  I live in California.  Who cares?  That's funny.  I wish she's having fun of it.  But I will say this.  I will say this in a serious tip.  Those of us who are pleasingly fun.  Right.  The love of us.  We have a sense of humor as well as we have feelings.  So, it depends on how you feel about that.  You need to worry about getting punched in his big, fat head.  I'm just like, I'm always amazed when celebrities, I guess, who have been in the public eye for a long time, don't realize they're going to get in trouble for saying something. 
[00:55:00]  But they shouldn't get in trouble.  We kind of know what we're going to get in trouble for.  But in terms of an apology, and maybe I'm alone in this, I don't think what he said is right, and I think it's hurtful.  But I'm kind of tired of celebrity apologies.  It's like they said it, they feel it.  Like, I don't know. 
[00:55:30]  That's the daughter from Roseanne.  But not the pretty one.  I don't know.  I just think it's a whole bunch of guys trying to do one-up on each other.  They're trying to be, you know, oh, look how funny he is.  I just don't take it.  I don't take it with any venom or any hurt.  I don't get that from him.  There's no way she's going to be offended.  No.  I mean, he's no, like, Playboy Centerfold himself.  Playgirl Centerfold himself.  I'm just saying.  No, she's okay to that.  He's got some curves on him, too. 
[00:56:00]  But it's just, I don't know.  I think that we're all kind of very politically correct, touchy-touchy-touchy, every little thing that everybody in the public eye says.  It's a bunch of guys.  Agreed.  We have a viewer's opinion.  This wasn't bad.  They didn't do this.  No, they didn't.  They were funny about it, didn't they?  They were saying.  Really, Charles Barkley, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.  You have the audacity to say those comments about women.  You definitely need to apologize.  Big, small, black, yellow, white, we are all the same and beautiful. 
[00:56:30]  No, no, you're not.  Obviously.  Stop.  You're not all beautiful.  You're not.  You're fat.  I'm not fuckable, madam.  Sorry.  Yes.  Yes.  I love that fake.  I think he needs to apologize.  I hear what you're saying, sir, but I think he needs to hear what people are saying who  were hurt by it.  You know what?  I made a bad joke.  I'm sorry.  No, you're not.  It was a good joke.  It was a good joke.  To people you don't even know.  Shut up.  What'd she say?  You know what?  She raises a point. 
[00:57:00]  I'm not going to disagree with that woman at all.  Wait, what'd she say?  I will not disagree with her.  She makes a point.  What'd she say?  What'd she say?  She just said Charles Barkley should apologize.  Yes, she did.  I don't mind necessarily agree, but she raises a good point, and that's the end of it.  Yeesh.  Oh, I know why.  Jimmy's an asshole.  Why?  Can I not agree with a lovely woman making a point?  I know why.  Why?  That's the boss's, the ex-boss's wife.  I didn't even know that.  He kind of runs TV. 
[00:57:30]  Oh.  He runs all of TV.  I didn't even know that.  She used to host that reality show, right?  She still does.  Big Brother.  She does Big Brother as well.  I didn't know.  She's a fucking idiot.  Look, I would never say.  Oh, that's right.  She is married to Les Moonves.  I just don't.  Good point.  Oh, God.  He should say he's sorry.  Oh, God.  She changed your mind.  She certainly did.  She actually said he should say sorry.  Why don't she marry more Moonves? 
[00:58:00]  I don't want to call me a yo.  He's bringing it around.  Certainly did.  Wow, that was stupid.  I don't know if I agree with that.  Ah, Jimmy.  You should apologize.  Get the fuck out of here.  It was a bad joke.  No, it wasn't.  It was.  It's a good joke.  He was killing.  It was funny.  He was killing.  He was talking about fat chicks.  See how hard Shaq was laughing?  Yes.  Do you know, ladies.  Let's remind the people Shaq enjoys a good reach on our face. 
[00:58:30]  So that's not too fair.  I don't think the ladies understand how funny fat chicks are to men.  They're the brunt of many jokes.  A lot of conversations that men have when we're hanging out goes over to the fat chick thing.  We talk about fatties.  It's a funny topic of conversation among men.  If your friends are fat, you make fun of them.  Right.  You make fun of them.  What was the name of our contest?  Fatty Pig Fatty?  Fatty Pig Fatty.  Fatty Pig Fatty. 
[00:59:00]  Can we bring back Fatty Pig Fatty?  I don't know.  Can we put it on the docket?  I think so.  In this day and age.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  We were trying to find the fattest woman that was willing to step forward.  And what were we giving them?  A dollar a pound or something?  No, more than that, I think.  I forgot what it was.  Yeah, it was a couple bucks a pound.  A couple?  Or was it ten bucks a pound or something?  Was it ten bucks a pound?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I think...  And we had some monsters that came walking through that studio door.  Yeah, real piggy wiggies.  And we called it Fatty Pig Fatty. 
[00:59:30]  You know what's not beautiful, fat chicks?  What?  The fucking crusty, darker skin between your folds.  Between your fucking fat folds.  Back of your neck.  Armpit fat.  Full of skin tags.  And the tone of the skin is fucking like three times darker than the rest of the skin.  Because it's just been rubbing together.  Jesus Christ.  Goes against nature a little bit, too.  It's not beautiful. 
[01:00:00]  It's not.  I was at the Philadelphia Zoo over the weekend.  Uh-oh.  I didn't see any fat animals.  No fat animals.  Because nature doesn't accept that.  No, they know what to stop eating and when they need to run around.  In the wild, nature just doesn't accept fat animals.  Yeah.  Elephants, are they officially fat?  I don't think they're fat considering their size and what they do.  Right.  I think the bigger the animal on this planet, because of things like gravity, you need to  have a stronger body. 
[01:00:30]  A stronger structure.  A stronger structure.  Well, that doesn't explain the giraffe.  No, but they're thin and tall.  So it's a different type of body.  I think they defy gravity in other ways, you know?  Do they?  Yeah.  Pretty strong.  All right.  You're not going to see them pushing shit like an elephant, Ken.  Right.  Let's go to Sonny in Boston.  Ta-ta-ta.  Thank you for this.  Hey, Opie, please, let me know.  You're not rooting for the Rangers in this series, are you? 
[01:01:00]  Oh, shit.  No.  I don't go Rangers.  I'm an Islanders fan.  Period.  No, I know that.  I know that.  So every team, safe to say, every team playing the Rangers, I'm four.  Okay.  So you're all right.  Very good.  Very good.  All right.  Now, listen.  I think they're going to Game 7, though, right?  Yeah.  Rangers made a bit of a comeback against the Penguins.  They're going Game 7.  Holy shit.  Go ahead.  Penguins.  Well, I wanted to get to the P.K. 
[01:01:30]  Subban incident in Boston's game.  Fucking Sean Thornton fucking squirting water at fucking P.K.  Subban and making a big fucking deal about it.  What happened?  Well, you know, it was...  Sean Thornton squared water at the black player on the Canadians and what?  He was fine for that?  Yeah.  Sean Thornton was fine for that.  Yeah.  And he kind of laughed about it, too.  Because, you know, pretty much Montreal...  Let me tell you something.  P.K.  It's too bad. 
[01:02:00]  I mean, even though he's a black player, he's like one of the best defensemen in the league.  And you can't take that away from him.  But the problem is that he plays like a pussy Canadian.  That's where it all comes from.  All this fucking political correctness is coming from Canada.  So you're not allowed to squirt water on a player?  Well, it's fucking hockey.  Of course you can.  Well, you're not.  Because he got fined for it.  Was it racist?  No, it's not.  He wasn't doing it for a racist.  Sonny, I wasn't even going to talk about this today. 
[01:02:30]  This is your story.  You're not allowed to squirt water on players if he got fined for doing so.  Ah, come on.  It's fucking hockey, you know?  I agree with you, but officially you're not allowed to do it.  Right.  Okay.  If they're fining players for squirting water on another hockey player, then they're not  allowing that behavior in the NHL.  That's right.  They're not.  Which I find ridiculous considering, you know, what kind of sport it is.  Yeah.  Especially where you're like, you know, you take the gloves off, you're allowed to fight  and get two minutes of penalty. 
[01:03:00]  You don't get penalized for it.  Yeah, because that's a sport where you squirt water in, you know, someone's face.  You're going to fight over it.  Yeah.  Exactly.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  Bye.  Can I comment on that phone call?  He waited an hour.  Epic fail!  He waited an hour for that.  Sonny.  All right, Sonny.  I don't even know the incident, really.  I don't know.  I don't know that one that well.  It's in our news prep, right?  That one?  We got the email.  I didn't think it was a big deal either. 
[01:03:30]  Okay.  Thanks, Sonny.  Look where you left us with.  Yeah, huh?  Bruin's Sean Thornton fined for squirting PK with water.  So he did get fined.  Misses to the left.  Marshan able to force it out around Placanix.  Fans on their feet here in Boston.  Canadians offside with 41.9 seconds remaining. 
[01:04:00]  What's Subban saying to Thornton, Pierre?  Subban thought Thornton sprayed some water on him, and he's gone over.  He's pointing at his mask right now.  He's telling Eric Furlatt, he put water up my face.  He's laughing.  Thornton's laughing over it.  All the fun it ever takes.  I didn't see it.  You think whatever you want.  I'll tell you one thing.  There's not a team in the league that wouldn't have PK Subban on their team. 
[01:04:30]  Did you see what Corey Perry did to Jeff Conner with the water bottle the other night?  Yes.  Did to his lost Olympic teammate, Jeff?  Are you doing that while he was skating?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, you got to get it.  Yeah, even though it's hockey, Sonny, you can't throw water on a player when he's skating by you.  Yeah, you got to be fined for that, of course.  I didn't even know how the water squirt happened.  It was during the game.  You can't do that.  Have they been doing that?  No one knew it.  They've probably been doing that for a long time.  Oh, I'm sure it's something that they do from time to time if they get away with it. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  You know, opposing players.  They just skate by your bench.  They give them a little squirt.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hockey players are just, you know, there's a lot of assholes there.  A lot of assholes.  A lot of assholes in hockey, which makes the sport great.  Go for them.  Exactly.  Any apology?  I don't know if there's an apology there yet.  How many apologies have we done so far?  Two?  I think three.  We went through Barkley's Don apology.  We went through Donald Sterling.  And we went through...  Don Jones, right? 
[01:05:30]  Don Jones.  From the Dolphins.  We didn't do the Premier League one yet.  No.  We didn't do...  Let's see.  Which one is...  Okay.  We got three more.  The Nintendo apology.  Right.  Nintendo apologizing for keeping same-sex couples out of game.  Out of a game.  What the fuck?  For what?  Now we're...  Oh.  People are apologizing for what's not happening in fucking games? 
[01:06:00]  Yes.  Yes.  And they actually felt like they should apologize for this.  And this would be the third apology today.  As we try to go ten days without an apology.  Nintendo apologizes for keeping same-sex couples out of game.  Nintendo is apologizing and pledging to be more inclusive after being criticized for not recognizing same-sex relationships in English editions of a life simulator video game.  The publisher said that while it was too late to change the current game, it was committed to building virtual equality into future versions.  Virtual equality. 
[01:06:30]  If they're produced.  Now we're up to virtual equality.  Yeah.  We need virtual equality.  Yeah.  Isn't that a fantasy world?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nintendo came under fire from fans and gay rights organizations this past week after refusing to add same-sex relationship options to the game to modaki life.  Something like that.  I don't know this game.  We apologizing for disappointing many people by failing to include same-sex relationships in the game.  Very dishonorable.  Nintendo said in a statement, unfortunately, it is not possible for us to change this game's design, and such a significant development change can't be accomplished with a post-ship patch. 
[01:07:00]  Unbelievable.  Yep.  Sorry we didn't put gay people in the video game.  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  This is terrific.  It's an important issue, an apology.  We are living in a crazy world.  Yeah, we are.  This is crazy stuff.  It's becoming complete insanity. 
[01:07:30]  Out of control.  Yeah.  The game was originally released in Japan last year and features a cast of Mii characters, Nintendo's personalized avatars and real players living on a virtual island.  Gamers can do things like shop, play games, go on dates, get married, and encounter celebrities like Christina Aguilera and Shaquille O'Neal.  Already a hit in Japan.  Tomodaki Life is set for release June 6th in North America and Europe.  Shaq's into everything.  Isn't he?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  God damn.  Why don't you buy my body wash?  This guy.  I'm a Nintendo game.  Ty Marini, a 23-year-old gay Nintendo fan.  I think that's every Nintendo fan.  Yes.  Come on.  Let's be real.  Launched a social media campaign last month seeking virtual equality for the game's character.  Just stop playing Nintendo.  I want to be able to.  Asshole.  Ready for this?  Yeah.  I want to be able to marry my real-life fiancee, me, but I can't do that. 
[01:08:30]  Marini said in a video posted online that attracted the attention of gaming sites and online forums this past week.  My only options are to marry some female me.  Ew.  I want to quit playing fucking video games, asshole.  Yeah.  Just get out there and, you know, live life.  I want to marry my fucking real-life person in a video game.  What a shithead.  Just stop it.  Yeah.  To change the gender of either my me or my fiancee is me, or to completely avoid marriage altogether,  miss out on the exclusive content that comes with it. 
[01:09:00]  It's a video game, you asshole.  Exclusive content that comes with a gay marriage in a game?  Oh, God.  Oh, that comes with a marriage.  Yeah.  So if you get married in the game, I guess it opens up new content.  Right.  But he doesn't want to marry a fake girl.  Right.  He wants to marry the fake guy.  Marini said Saturday that he was very happy with Nintendo's response.  I don't believe they are a homophobic company at all.  I think that the exclusion of same-sex relationships was just an unfortunate oversight. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  So.  Oh, boy.  Committed.  Lifetime company.  We pledge.  Look, that's all you have to do.  You don't even have to read the whole thing.  Pledge.  Committed.  Lifetime company.  This is their statement.  Inclusive.  More.  Sincerely.  Exactly.  Sincerely.  Diversity.  Diversity's in here.  Yes.  Ah.  Long-time values.  Working harder.  Rooted.  Rooted. 
[01:10:00]  Bisexual.  LGBT.  It's all in here, guys.  All the catchphrases.  I don't even have to read the statement.  All the key words.  You don't even have to read the statement.  No.  Needs to catch up.  Uh-huh.  Right.  Florida's hamburger?  Go ahead.  Glad.  With all the A's.  That glad.  The angry glad.  That's the angry glad.  Not the happy glad.  The angry glad.  Glad.  So that's apology number three for today.  As we try to go ten days on the Opie and Anthony show without an apology. 
[01:10:30]  We won't even go a week, dude.  A week without an apology.  You'll never get it.  Hell no.  Ten is just a nice, even number.  That's all.  And we kind of include the weekend a little bit.  Premier League Chief Scudamore apologizes over inappropriate emails.  Oh, boy.  The head of the Premier League apologized Sunday after private emails were published containing  jokes about women.  An embarrassing episode for one of the most powerful figures in English football on the  final day of the season.  The Sunday Mirror newspaper published exchanges by Chief Executive Richard Scudamore with colleagues 
[01:11:00]  and friends after copies were taken by his former personal assistant.  Yeah.  So he had some emails and he was fooling around.  A few emails.  Somebody fucking stole them.  Stolen.  Right.  And what did he say?  These were private emails.  They were received from and sent to my private and confidential email address, which is  temporary, which is, which a temporary employee who was with the organization for only a matter  of weeks should not have accessed and was under no instruction to do so. 
[01:11:30]  Nonetheless, I accept the contents are inappropriate and apologize for any offense caused.  Why the fuck did you apologize for a private email joke?  To this person, it was an error of judgment and I will not, and I will not make that again.  Do we have the actual emails?  I hope so.  Yes.  What was it?  Degrading to what?  Women?  What was it?  One woman in particular.  One woman?  Jokes about women.  Uh-oh.  That's what guys do. 
[01:12:00]  Right.  We do this stuff.  Talk about bed.  Everybody does this stuff.  Whanking.  Yes.  If you think you're in private, you're going to make some jokes and you're going to talk  about people.  Of course.  And he has to apologize for this now.  He should have said, I'm not apologizing.  This was in my private life and this is what people do.  And why would I apologize?  And we all know that people do this.  So why are we making believe that no one else does this?  We all do this.  Jesus.  He referred to females as gash. 
[01:12:30]  Right.  He warned his lawyer friend who he was talking to through email to keep a female colleague  off your shaft.  Off your shaft.  What the fuck is he sorry for?  Told sexist jokes and mocked female irrationality.  All right.  All right.  He's being a guy.  This is what guys fucking...  He's being a guy.  He's got to apologize for being a guy.  Wow.  You're just not allowed anymore.  Right.  You're not allowed to be a guy.  I've got to make we.  Chris Jericho should be here. 
[01:13:00]  And we have another apology as well.  Oh, boy.  Our fifth and final one, I think.  Jesus.  Although, you know, it's been a couple hours.  We haven't checked, you know, the TVs and the newspapers.  I have to apologize.  Jimmy's got to apologize.  Public apology.  Yeah.  For being so cute.  Ha, ha, ha.  When the lights go away.  Oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[01:13:30]  Better, better, better, better, better, more.  I like it, man.  That's great, man.  Chris Jericho in studio.  And, of course, that's his latest single, Lights Go Out from Fozzy.  Damn.  Yeah, that's pretty good.  Cool, man.  Thanks.  Yeah, strippers all over the country are rejoicing.  Yeah.  Actually, it's funny.  There's actually a radio network for strippers.  Right.  And you'll service to them just like you service to rock radio. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  And the stripper network is very excited about that song.  Oh, wow.  It's not a stripper network.  I'm not kidding, dude.  I didn't even hear about this before.  There's actually, like, a company that services to strip clubs.  Like, here's the top ten songs for strip clubs.  Yeah, yeah.  You should check this out, and then the DJs check it out or whatever.  So, I learned that, too.  See, of all the years of hanging out with strippers, I didn't know you could actually work with them.  We were just talking, again, about Chris Jericho's first appearance on our show.  Classic, right?  Well, I mean, you've got to think it's, like, 15 years ago. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, man.  I mean, well, yeah, 2000, so almost 14 years ago.  You came in.  You're one of the biggest wrestlers for the WWE at the time.  WWF.  WWF, excuse me.  Yeah, I still get that all fucked up.  Mixed up, right.  And you refused to be Chris Jericho.  You're doing this Fozzy thing.  And me and Ann are looking at each other like, who gives a fuck about Fozzy?  Our whole job is to make him break character.  We would beat the shit out of you.  And you would not break character.  I would not break character. 
[01:15:00]  And it was funny.  When we first started, it was weird because we were just getting together, having fun,  playing covers.  Right.  The name of the band was Fozzy Osbourne.  And then we got a record deal signed by Johnny Zuzula, who signed Metallica and Anthrax in,  like, 1983.  He signed us, and he was super excited about this cover band thing.  Right.  So we said, like, let's just do, have some fun with it and do, like, an Andy Kaufman,  Tony Clifton thing.  Sure.  We would never break character and make up the story.  And that's what I was doing that day.  It was, like, one of the first days we'd ever done it. 
[01:15:30]  Now, we also just found out, too, though, that that was Jimmy Norton's first day.  That's what I'm checking right now.  He's looking to see.  I have E-Rock looking.  So you and Chris Jericho were on the first time together.  I remember Fozzy.  I remember Moongoose McQuaid.  I remember.  And Dice was in the studio.  Dice was in the studio.  I'm pretty sure I was there for that.  Wow.  And Dice thought it was real.  He was like, hey, because we were talking about chronologically or something.  He's like, come on, he's talking about his choreography.  So you've got to understand he's talking about the times.  He had no idea of the difference between choreography and chronologically. 
[01:16:00]  Dice rules.  The only reason I bring it up, 14 years later, you're still doing it.  It's your number one thing you're doing right now.  Well, I mean, obviously, the band has changed.  I think after about a year of doing kind of the fun traveling Wilburys Blues Brothers thing,  we started doing our own thing.  And, yeah, it is my main gig over the last four years.  And it's really blown up.  We've been doing great and, you know, toured the world countless times  and, you know, went with Metallica last year to Australia  and did Shine Down all year a couple of years ago. 
[01:16:30]  And now we're on tour with Buck Cherry.  So it's been going good, man.  It's been, you know, we've really been working hard on it, as you heard from Lights Go Out.  What was the first moment where you were like, wow, this is time to do our own thing  and this is like a legit thing?  Well, actually, what it was is that the first two years of the band was kind of like, you know, the fun thing.  And then we got a chance to do the Stern Show when Howard was doing this thing where he said  all celebrity bands were the shits.  And he could put together a band that was better than any celebrity band. 
[01:17:00]  So he put together a band called The Losers.  Of course he said that.  Of course, right?  And it was, you know, I don't know if I'm allowed to say the name.  I don't care about the H name.  We don't give a fuck.  So, yeah, he beat, you know, he would have this thing where there was three record executives  and they would judge you and give a vote.  And it was, you know, Corey Feldman's band and I think Tina Yothers and maybe...  She had a band, Tina Yothers?  I think she did.  I kind of remember that.  The Bacon Brothers had one.  Doug Flutie had a band. 
[01:17:30]  Like, all these guys, yeah, all these people had bands.  Flutie's band, he took that seriously for a long time.  I don't know where he's at with it now.  I'm not sure.  But so we went in there.  That was the first time I was like, listen, we got to just go and be ourselves.  And we played one of our own tunes.  And, dude, I mean, we crushed it.  We killed him.  It was funny because you could tell that the record execs were there told, like, do not  even think about it.  And the one guy voted for us, which was the first time anybody had ever voted for somebody  else.  And after we ended up losing, I was so pissed.  But Howard, after...  Come on! 
[01:18:00]  We lost two to one.  But Howard, after I saw him in the room, he's like, listen, you know, he's super, like,  nervous or, like, neurotic or whatever.  He's like, I can't do this anymore.  It was too much pressure.  You guys killed us.  The only reason that you won is because it's my show.  I'm retiring this.  I'm never doing it again.  So...  And that's when people still, like, I guess they play reruns and stuff.  They still come up to me and go, we heard you on the Stern show.  I was like, yeah, it's kind of...  We should have won.  That was when we realized, like, we need to go and do our own thing.  Wow.  Step out and do your own songs.  Yeah.  Man.  So, yeah, it was funny.  Have you toured with Sabbath at all? 
[01:18:30]  Have you played with them at a festival?  With?  Sabbath.  We did download two years ago.  We talked about this, where Sabbath played the night after us.  Oh, exactly.  That was Metallica Sabbath that year.  So, we didn't get a chance.  But it was funny.  I went and saw Sabbath, I guess, the summertime, you know, on the 13 tour.  And I had just taken my son to see the Stones.  So, we had a great time at the Stones.  I mean, I wanted him to be able to grow up and say, you know, I saw the Rolling Stones with my dad when I was eight years old.  And it was great. 
[01:19:00]  And Mick was great.  And Keith was great.  So, about two or three weeks later, Sabbath was coming to town.  And I said, you want to go see Sabbath?  You know, same thing.  Keep this, you know, keep the ball rolling on these classic acts.  So, he's like, yeah, yeah.  I said, well, you know, Ozzy swears a lot.  He said, it's okay.  I play Call of Duty.  I've heard swears, Dad.  So, okay, cool.  So, we go to the show.  And, of course, Ozzy walks up right off the bat.  I want to fucking see a fucking wild crowd.  And I'm standing next to my son.  He's cool.  And he's war pigs comes on.  And he's, you know, yelling and doing the thing with Ozzy with the hands. 
[01:19:30]  So, they have these screens on the side of the stage, right?  And, so, Jimmy just said we talked about this last time.  I was just writing it down for him so we knew.  I can't remember how many times I've been with you guys.  Bottom line is, hey, it's new to somebody.  They have these screens on the side of the stage where they're showing all these, like, really blasphemous images.  And there's nothing like seeing two naked nuns making out, covered in blood, jacking off a cross.  Oh, nice.  There you go.  Yes, it was pretty. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, and I think you left very early.  We did.  We did.  Sorry.  No, no, no.  I'm not like your crazy old uncle.  It's like, I remember I went to Sabbath with my son once.  You're like, I know, Uncle Charlie.  We heard this story.  I never noticed the videos, though.  That's the funny part.  I never noticed the videos.  But you're fixated on Ozzy.  I'm so watching the guys.  They could literally be showing my picture behind them, and I wouldn't notice it.  But I was the opposite.  Once I saw that, I couldn't pay attention to the show.  All I was looking at was, please don't show anything else bad.  You're worried about it.  We had to leave halfway through.  I haven't seen the gig since.  Here's the rule with the show.  It's fine to tell the same story twice. 
[01:20:30]  It really is.  Because there's always a whole bunch of people that are here for the first time.  Well, the thing is, too.  No, here's the last part of it.  But if you tell it for the third time, especially Anthony will say, wait, don't tell this story again.  We heard it.  But do you guys even remember?  I remember that one.  You have so many guests here every day.  No, because that's a good story.  If it's a good story, we'll remember.  I didn't remember until you started.  I'm like, oh, yeah, because you weren't so savage.  Who was the one that tried?  Steiner with the fucking Rivera cardboard glove that he had growing up.  All right.  And do you know, Mariano Rivera, the first glove he had, do you know, it was made of cardboard. 
[01:21:00]  It was like the first time he told it.  It was like, oh, you know, the impoverished kid.  He grows up there.  It's a great story.  Second time, we're like, ah.  Me and Opio look at each other like, didn't he tell this story?  Third time he comes on.  And, you know, Mariano Rivera had this glove, and I went, if you tell this glove story again,  I'm going to kill you.  So two is totally acceptable.  For real.  It really is.  Well, now it's not acceptable.  I'll remember now next time for sure. 
[01:21:30]  I really hope you tell it a third time.  No, we do the same thing.  We tell the same story.  I might do it just to bait you.  Just see what happens.  No, it's fine.  As long as you know that we've, like, it's never bad to tell the same story again.  As long as we all know that we're just kind of re-going over it.  Sure, sure.  We tell the same stories as well.  Yeah, sometimes it fits into another, like, category, or it's in another context of what  we're talking about, and you add a little more to it.  Right.  Some other offshoot of it.  You know, whatever.  Yeah, there's ways.  You forget, though.  Like, I forget how many times I come in and see you guys. 
[01:22:00]  I think every time I'm in New York City with anything, you guys, I bring Jericho in.  Of course.  Whatever.  He's in.  Here's the question.  Have you gone to another concert since with your son?  No, because afterwards he's like, you know, next time we do something, I'm deciding because  that didn't work out good.  Yeah.  So I'm thinking about maybe trying to kiss his tour in the summer, and that's a good kid  show.  Yeah.  You know, there's not going to be any swearing or any, you know, naked nuns.  What does he listen to, though?  How old is he, first of all?  He's 10 now.  What does he listen to?  Well, I mean, he's into, you know, whatever the kids, whatever the kids are listening 
[01:22:30]  to.  Top 40 stuff.  Well, that's why I asked, because when we were growing up, there were so many rock bands,  and I just don't see a lot of rock bands anymore.  Of course, you're doing it, and you're successful at it, but.  He likes my band, but he is more into, you know, wherever you're here on Top 40, which  is, you know, the one that pops in my head is Jason Derulo, Talk Dirty to Me.  And once again, you got these little kids singing, you know, Talk Dirty to Me.  Your booty don't need no explanation.  You know, seven-year-old girls singing, your booty don't need no explanation.  Right.  Don't really know what it means. 
[01:23:00]  Oh, boy.  But it's funny, because my girls, they're twin seven-year-old girls.  They put together a little dance for Lights Go Out.  Like, they remembered it right away.  It caught, you know, the hook caught them.  So they put together a dance and did this little routine.  But the song is You Get Me Off, and they think it's You Hit Me Off, which is good.  So now I don't have to explain anything.  Right.  Yes.  So they have their guitars and hit each other with it.  You hit me off.  Boom.  So it's, like, good.  Right.  That's the way it should be.  See, you got Talk Dirty to Me pulled up right there. 
[01:23:30]  You like this, Sam?  There you go.  Your booty don't need explaining.  Let's catch it.  He's Haitian.  You talk dirty to me.  Yeah, all right.  All right.  Jimmy asked if he's Haitian.  No, he says something about Haitian.  He said from Haiti to New York City or something.  I heard an accent. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  I'm really a literal idiot.  And no more WWE?  Or where are we at with that?  Well, it was, let's see.  The product's probably in here.  It was in July.  It was when I worked there last.  It's been almost a year.  It's been almost a year, which flies by.  And, of course, you know, it's funny.  Sam and I were talking earlier.  I actually now know his name after seeing him for the last 14 years.  Does that make you happy?  It makes him very happy.  But I have a lot of stuff that I do, as you guys know.  And it doesn't matter what I do.  I mean, if I'm on Instagram, I could post a picture of me and the Pope. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  And the first 500 comments would be, when you go back to WWE.  Right.  And there's certain people, that's all they want.  They don't care about anything else.  And it's funny because, you know, sometimes there's other things.  Guys, I remember when William Shatner was on Saturday Night Live.  He's like, you know, you, have you ever kissed a girl?  There's more to life than Star Trek.  Move on, people.  Move on.  So I have a podcast, which actually William Shatner did.  It was the best ever.  But anybody that's on my podcast, and I'm like, you guys, if I have someone on my show, you've got to trust me. 
[01:25:00]  It's going to be interesting and fun and cool.  But there's some people that are just like, they would rather me have like the lowest level independent wrestler that no one knows than William fucking Shatner.  Right.  And I'm like, just listen to Shatner.  Trust me, you'll like it.  You'll have fun.  You'll have fun.  Right.  But I mean, that's just kind of how it goes.  So I mean, I'm not saying that I wouldn't go back.  It's not anything like that.  It's just I have other things going on.  And the band is going great and the podcast and all these other things that I'm doing.  So I mean, it's probably an easier schedule, too, man.  We've talked to enough of you guys.  That wrestling schedule is brutal. 
[01:25:30]  Well, it just never ends.  I mean, you know, like right now we're on tour.  Like I said, we're touring with Buck Cherry and promoting the single.  And that's a month.  That's the month of May.  But then when we're done, you know, I'm home for a couple of weeks before we head to England.  So you get those blocks of time.  WWE never ends.  Right.  It's four times a week, every week, all year long.  And it's a hamster wheel.  Crazy.  And when you get out of that is when you realize, like, oh, my gosh.  Like, what do you do on Memorial Weekend?  Well, I'll probably have a barbecue or something like that.  Something to do. 
[01:26:00]  You're actually allowed to have a life?  Like, what?  Right, right.  You know, I got suspended a couple of years ago for kicking a flag in Brazil.  And I was suspended for a month.  And I was so mad at the beginning of it for getting suspended.  And then about three days in, I was like, what am I mad about?  Like, I actually can't do something.  Great.  Yeah.  Wait, why would they suspend you over there?  Well, it's a funny story, Opie.  Let me tell you.  I never heard this one.  Sam's on it.  Jericho kicks Brazilian flag and cuts promo.  But the WWE suspended you a month?  Yes.  Yes.  What happened was, we're watching the clip right now. 
[01:26:30]  Actually, that's really good footage.  It looks pro footage.  I've got the flag.  I throw it on the ground.  I kick it out of the ring.  Right.  That's all I did, okay?  Right.  So you see me standing there.  Some fan had a Brazilian flag.  I took it out of the referee's hand.  I held it up in the air.  I threw it on the ground.  I kicked it out.  Now, halfway through this match that we had, it was in Sao Paulo, Brazil.  That was in Brazil you did that?  In Brazil.  Wow.  So it's, you know, typical heel, it's called heel as a bag. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Typical heel bullshit.  Of course.  You know, like an iron cheek.  Yeah, or like Sergeant Slaughter.  It's like going to the garden and saying, the Rangers suck.  Boo.  Right.  I hate the Knicks.  Boo.  This has been part of wrestling forever.  Exactly.  That's my point.  Right.  So, you know, you saw it.  I just kicked it out of the ring.  Whatever.  Halfway through the match, I'm in the corners with CM Punk and I'm beating him up and there's  another ref that comes in beside me and I'm like, why is there now another ref?  And he goes, you have to apologize right now.  I'm like, you know, I'm beating him.  Like, what?  I'm fighting him down the ground.  What?  You have to apologize right now. 
[01:27:30]  This is serious.  They're going to take you to jail if you don't apologize.  So I say to Punk, like, stay there for a second.  I'm like, what are you talking about?  His name is Charles.  What are you talking about, Charles?  Charles, the guys in the back, there's soldiers in the back that are going to arrest you if  you don't apologize.  So I'm like, okay, so this is serious.  All right.  So I grab the microphone and I see one of the other guys, like one of the head guys from  behind, like the producer is called, the agent.  And he's like, this is serious.  You have to apologize.  I'm like, all right.  So fine people of Brazil, I am sorry that I kicked this flag. 
[01:28:00]  I did not mean any disrespect.  It was all part of the show.  I did it to entertain all you.  I love Brazil and the WWE loves Brazil and we just want everyone to be happy.  I said people like they're clapping, like thinking like, what the fuck is he talking  about?  You have that?  Like, why is he, you know, apologize?  Right.  Uh-huh.  So go back in the corner and Punk comes out.  We start fighting, continue the match and we finish the match.  And the match ends with the good guy beating the bad guy, who's me, picking up the Brazilian  flag, waving it in the air, wearing it as a cape, running around the ring, people cheering. 
[01:28:30]  That's the idea.  Right.  Bad guy.  Oh.  Am I apologizing there?  Let me see.  Oh, no, that's me cutting a promo after kicking the flag.  So, uh, I now, I now, I now walk to the back and you guys are going to love this, especially  you, because I know how you are.  I'm going to tell you the story.  I walk to the back and now I'm like, I'm like ostracized.  Like, no one's looking at me.  Oh, shit.  No one's really saying anything. 
[01:29:00]  And like, there's all these soldiers, because soldiers were security in Brazil and they all  are standing there with their guns.  It's like, you know, martial law or something.  And I go to the back and I say to one of the other people, like, what's going on?  Why is no one talking to me?  Like, this guy over here, there's a colonel.  And when you kick the flag, he started flipping out.  He flipped over a coffee table and screaming and yelling that he wanted you arrested and taken  to jail immediately.  No, I'm in little briefs, spandex covered, you know, underwear, studded underwear.  If I go straight to jail in Brazil, I'm a lady boy. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, you're done.  I'm branded lady boy.  I'm in big trouble.  You might take a couple of them out at first.  Yeah, that's it.  I could take your numbers.  One or two.  Eventually they're going to get to it.  Yes, there would be some insertion and not in a good way.  So I'm like, you've got to be kidding about it.  I apologize.  It doesn't matter.  So they were able to calm the guy down.  So I text Vince McMahon to tell him, listen, man, I just got, you know, I got in trouble  for kicking a flag.  I just wanted to tell you, note to self, next time you come to Brazil, don't kick a flag. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  I get this text back.  You will not be coming back to Brazil.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Why would you do something like that?  I'm so angry at you.  I'm like, what?  Like, this is typical heel stuff.  So I call him and I'm like, Vince, he's like, I don't want to talk to you right now.  I'm so furious at you.  You are suspended for 30 days.  No, you're suspended.  Get in the next plane and fly home.  This is Bush League bullshit.  You know, I don't want to take, so he hangs up on me and I'm like, I'm suspended. 
[01:30:30]  Like, what?  So the rest of the crew flies to the next town, like in Guatemala or something, and  I'm the ostracized guy that has a police escort taking me to the airport to kick me out of  the country.  Please leave our country.  Yeah, a police escort.  Like, I've now murdered people.  Were they shitty to you or no?  Yeah.  And Vince's thing was, he's like, get out of the country right now.  Like, you could be in really big trouble.  And so he was pretty furious at me and I found out online that I was suspended for 
[01:31:00]  30 days without pay.  The whole rigmarole and the best of all was, it says on the W website, and this is how I  found out I was suspended.  He never called me to tell me.  I read it on the website and it says, Chris Jericho has been suspended for 30 days for denigrating  the Brazilian flag.  And I was like, just the fact that the word denigrating was used, I know Vince wrote that  personally.  Because only he denigrated.  Denigrated.  Well, what's a good word?  Denigrating.  Yes, he desecrated? 
[01:31:30]  No.  No.  He insulted?  No.  Denigrated.  Yeah.  Denigrated.  That's the word we're going with.  Denigrated.  God damn it.  Chael Sonnen got a lot of shit for that too when he was, uh...  Yes, and actually I talked to Andreas Kisser from Sepultura, who's a friend of mine from  Brazil, and he said that when Max Cavalera, the original singer, was there and he kicked  the Brazilian flag, and they are Brazilian, they came and took him off stage and took  him right away.  Like, it's a felony to kick a flag.  Once again, something that would have been good to tell us before the show. 
[01:32:00]  Sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So yeah, they take it really, really seriously.  That's weird, because like you said, it's typical heel stuff.  You really just try to get it in their heads.  Yeah, I've done it like in Mexico or Japan or in border to McAllen, Texas.  And in the end, it plays out okay, obviously, like you said.  Of course, because in the end, you know, I know Punk is, you know, waving the flag.  Yeah, I know Punk's winning, and he's going to have the flag and wave it, and everybody's  happy.  But the one guy was convinced that wrestling was real and was not happy with me.  That makes the website, but fans, do they think, oh, that's still just part of the show 
[01:32:30]  that they suspended Chris Jericho?  I think so.  I think so.  Another gimmick?  Well, Vince told me, and he's like, you know, I had to do that, because we're trying to  break into these countries, and I have to let anybody know that if something like this  happens, that we will take full responsibility and punish them to the full extent of our  law.  But he assumes that you know where the line is, and that's got to be tough, though.  Yeah, and sometimes they'll tell you, like, okay, we have some dignitaries here, so no 
[01:33:00]  spitting.  Like, you know, sometimes if you get punched in the face, you'll spit up in the air.  Or, you know, don't do that.  We have, you know, the governor of Georgia is here, and we're doing WrestleMania-Atlanta,  so no spitting, no ball shots, you know.  Keep it clean, kids.  But for that, they didn't say anything, and so I didn't know.  So, yeah, kicking the flag.  You look at, like, Sarge's Slaughter and the Iron Sheik, and it was all that cultural...  It's a different world now, though.  You know, it's a real corporate thing.  They're a publicly traded company.  It's PG, trying to attract, you know, the Walmarts of the world to be sponsors. 
[01:33:30]  So, all these type of things.  It's weird, because I kind of had one foot in the old school, one foot in the new school.  Sometimes I'll do something where you don't even realize that, like, you can't...  Like, we used to do that all the time.  Well, things have changed, Chris.  Slap on wrists, you know.  Right, right.  So...  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah, man.  What's that one, Sam?  Oh, is that one...  That's JBL goose-stepping in Germany.  He was goose-stepping, and he had his arm out in a Heil Hitler type of... 
[01:34:00]  Wow.  He was real, though.  He got in trouble, but he did not get suspended.  Oh, my God.  What is he thinking?  Yeah, JBL was goose-stepping.  He got fired from Fox News, where he was working.  Right.  But he did not get suspended.  I got suspended for kicking the flag.  Yeah.  He did not get suspended for goose-stepping.  He got fired...  He was at Fox when he did that?  Yeah.  Was that the only time you've been suspended?  I got suspended...  Well, I got fined a couple times when they banned bleeding a couple years ago. 
[01:34:30]  Like, no more bleeding in the ring.  I mean, you know, unless it happens, you know...  But they officially banned it.  I didn't know that.  They banned it.  So I got fined a couple times for that, where guys kind of crossed the line and still did it.  And I happened to be in the ring with them.  I always get in trouble for things I didn't do.  Wait, wait, wait.  So they're cutting you.  No, no.  Themselves.  So why do you get suspended if you're in the ring with them?  It's a weird story, man.  Oh, well, I'll tell you.  So we had this cage match, me and this guy, Batista. 
[01:35:00]  And he thought that he wanted to have some blood in the match.  And he didn't feel that, you know, cage match should have blood.  And I said, listen, dude, you know the rules.  No blood allowed.  You know, whatever.  Don't tell me any more about it.  Do your thing.  I don't care.  Whatever.  So we do the match and I hit him and he cuts himself and bleeding everywhere and that's fine.  We come back through the curtain and, of course, now Vince is angry again.  And Vince is furious that there was blood.  And, like, you know, I really didn't, I kind of knew but didn't know. 
[01:35:30]  And I wasn't really sure even when he did it.  I mean, I just kind of look up and he's bleeding.  And he's a big, bald guy.  Right.  So he's got, like, a razor cut right in the middle of his forehead.  Where do you guys keep the razors?  Not really, like, you know, you can cover it with hair if you have something.  So it's fucking obvious.  Like, dude, like, come on.  But where was the razor the whole time?  It depends.  Different guys have different ways they used to do it.  Some guys used to carry it in their mouth.  I know.  Wow, really?  Yeah, yeah.  I used to always put it in my wrist tape.  Right.  You know, in the tape there.  And how, where would you pull it out of people seeing it?  Like, would you just kind of go to the ground and kind of cover yourself up and do it? 
[01:36:00]  Right.  With the crazy stuff.  Like, if you were cutting yourself in real life, they'd put you in, like, an insane asylum.  No.  Right.  You know, you'd be, like, a fucking psychiatrist.  We'd just, like, cutting each other, right?  So, wait, you cut, you would cut, that's amazing.  You would cut your head and then put it back in your wrist thing?  No, you'd give it to the ref.  Or, you know, if you could throw it under the ring or just get rid of it.  So, this is a whole art form to it.  Like, this is, like, a little, like, you don't have any real bad scars.  No, no, the only scar I have is one that I got in a real car crash.  But, yeah, you just do it up in your hairline.  So, you know, just a little, little stuff.  Or some of these guys, they would just, like, fuck it. 
[01:36:30]  Well, yeah, you talk about the, you know, you talk about the Sheik or you talk about, like, guys like Sabu.  Or these guys had, like, they wore the scars as badges of honor.  Yeah, yeah.  And early on, I was like, I do not want to walk around looking like that.  Oh, shit.  It's like a road map on here.  Like, Abdul the Butcher, if you see it, it's like a freaking road map of all these really, you could actually stick, like, you know.  I think Flair's got the bad gigs, too.  So, he does the deed.  Coming to the back, once again, Vince is furious.  Once again, I call Vince.  And he's like, I don't want to talk to you right now. 
[01:37:00]  This could cost us money.  I'll deal with this next week.  So, I'm like, all right.  So, pull up that picture of New Jack so they can see.  So, the next week, we're in Manchester, England, right?  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah, you see the gig marks there?  That's what they call them, gig marks?  Gig marks, yeah.  Oh, my God.  It's like a Klingon.  Yeah, exactly.  Right, it looks like a Klingon, yeah.  So, that's, and that's like the badge of honor, right?  It looks like a Freddy Krueger skin.  So, we show up the next week in Manchester, England, and we get escorted into this room. 
[01:37:30]  And there's a semicircle of chairs and a TV.  So, we go in there and sit down, and it's me and Batista and Dean Malenko, who is the  agent, the producer of the match, kind of like the, you know, the liaison between Vince  and the guys and the referees.  There's four of us.  So, Vince comes in.  He's kind of walking around, like, you know, back and forth.  He turns on, well, he didn't know how to turn on the DVD player, actually.  It was a little bit of a comedic moment where they're both trying to figure out what's 
[01:38:00]  going on with Uncle Charlie.  Why is the clock still blinking?  So, they finally, they finally turn it on.  Now, have you guys ever seen, and it's a, it's a, it's a footage of this match that we  had.  And have you guys ever seen, like, you know, one of those, like, UFO shows where they'll  say, like, if you look in the corner, you can see the, if you want, they'll put, like,  a white circle around.  Yeah, it'll be a little lighter.  Yeah, a little lighter.  But it's like, shh, there it is.  So, he's made this video of the match, and there's a white circle around, around Batista's 
[01:38:30]  head where you can see him, you know, where he cuts himself, and then they rewind it and  show it again.  Cut, rewind, cut, rewind, cut, rewind, yeah, cut, rewind, with the white circle.  Now, the funny thing was, there was, there was, like, the camera angles that you're used  to, but there was another camera angle from, like, far up in the arena that I've never  seen before, ever.  Oh, shit.  And I've never seen since.  So, there was a secret camera set up there, which I'm sure films everything.  Right.  So, if you've ever picked your nose, you know, anything, like, there's some, I was like, 
[01:39:00]  why is there a secret camera that no one ever knows about?  So, yeah, so it's cut, and back and forth, and there it is, and then he drops the razor,  and there's your UFO light over that.  Oh, shit.  And I was like, how much time did you guys spend on doing this?  This is a guy cutting himself, not the Zapruder film.  This is not the assassination of JFK, right?  And I would assume all he had to do was ask, and you guys would have said, yeah, yeah.  Well, yeah, I mean, it's obvious.  It's right there.  Right.  Just look at his head.  Right.  And the thing was, Batista didn't deny it. 
[01:39:30]  He's like, okay, I did it.  I caught, you caught me.  I'll take full responsibility.  And we were all like, you know, I was the, you know, the ring general of the match, the veteran.  I was like, I'll take responsibility.  No, I will.  No, I will.  And Vince was like, no, I will show you again and again what happened.  And we see it, and it's like, well, you got it, you know?  So he goes around.  He's like, you know, I could fire all you guys, but I'm going to hit you where it hurts.  I'm going to fine you.  And we're like, okay, he's going to fine us, whatever.  You know, big deal, right?  Right.  So he goes, Batista, I'm going to fine you $100,000. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  And I was like, what?  Like, everybody was just, just like this room right now, just quiet.  Jesus.  Serious.  And then I was like, oh, my God, like, that sucks for Batista.  And then I'm like, wait a second.  Wait a minute.  I'm next.  And then he looks at me, and he's like, Jericho.  He says, because early he had said, none of you guys called me about this.  And none of you guys, and I raised my hand.  I was like, Vince, I called you. 
[01:40:30]  And you hung up on me in 12 seconds, remember?  He's like, all right, and no one called me except for Jericho.  And I kind of like, I got him, right?  Oh, good.  And he said, he looks at me, and he's like, Jericho, you are fined $5,000.  And I was like, take 10.  No problem, man.  No problem.  And I kind of started laughing.  He's like, what are you laughing at?  I'm like, nothing.  Because I'm like, he could change his mind right now.  And I'm convinced I had not called him and reminded him of that.  That you had called, yeah.  He would find me $100,000.  Did he have to pay the $100,000?  He did. 
[01:41:00]  And I got fined $5,000, and the ref, and the agent.  And to his credit, he paid everybody's fines.  Batista paid all the fines for himself.  Wow.  How much money was he making for that match that he could just hand us $100,000?  Not that.  I mean, that was a big hit.  That's a yearly hit.  That's a few matches worth of money right there.  Probably a month, two months of work, probably.  But you have no choice.  What are you going to do?  Oh, that's a yearly hit.  You don't mean that's what he made in a year.  No.  No.  What I'm saying, that's a huge hit for the year. 
[01:41:30]  Okay.  You know, I mean, so, I mean, yeah.  It doesn't matter.  If you're Donald Trump, $100,000 is still a lot of money.  But, yeah, so that was $5,000.  I got fined for that.  And another time it happened.  So I ended up getting fined about $20,000 for other people bleeding.  Except for me.  Oh, shit.  But, yeah.  So that's...  Did you get right on the phone with Vince the second it happened?  Vince cut himself up.  All the time.  It was just in the ring.  You have to, like, have that type of relationship with him.  You know, whether you want to admit to things or not.  Sometimes things go wrong. 
[01:42:00]  And I always would let him know, like, this is what happened.  And if I didn't, I would hear about it.  You make a good point about having one foot in the old school and one foot in the new school.  Yeah.  Because we were all in with wrestling when we first met you.  We loved it.  We were watching it weekly, and then...  Because we loved the edge of the writing.  There was such an edginess of the writing.  And then I remember how it started...  Remember?  And it started changing, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, oh, they're kind of cleaning it up.  They might be going for more mainstream people.  That's exactly what it is.  They kind of lost us.  I mean, we still, like, you know, take a peek here and there. 
[01:42:30]  But not like we used to, man.  The Rock and Stone Cold and yourself and Mick Foley and Triple H.  That writing was hilarious and edgy.  They called it...  It was the Attitude Era is what the name of it is.  And it was about attitude and about kind of, you know, pushing the envelope and breaking the rules.  But then what happens when the company became publicly traded, you know, and like we said,  trying to get the higher level sponsors and trying to...  They wanted to change the whole...  You make it more of a family show. 
[01:43:00]  Right.  And that's, you know, basically when it started to change, which I think in some ways is good  because I remember, you know, once again, as a bad guy, being up against Austin and, you know,  he was selling, like, foam finger, middle fingers.  And you'd have an eight-year-old kid, like, literally, like, I'd walk to the ring and some little kid would be like,  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  And I'm looking at him with his dad behind me, like the proud father.  Ah, he's telling Jericho off.  I'm like, you really let your kids talk to you this way?  It's terrible.  Right.  Like, this is terrible.  Well, if my son talked and he said that, it'd be swat to the head. 
[01:43:30]  Like, what did you say?  Yeah.  So, I mean, once you kind of get to that point, maybe it's good to kind of pull back a little bit.  So you've had other guys...  I'm always amazed, like, with UFC guys, too, and boxers.  You've had other guys' blood just drip into your mouth during matches or...  Well, I mean, not like that.  But, you know, it was pretty bad, like, when you think about it.  Like, you know, there's a couple companies that I worked in in Japan that were kind of based around that.  There was one called FMW that was based around just blood matches.  And barbed wire death matches and barbed wire explosive death matches. 
[01:44:00]  And all it'd be is a couple kind of fat, crazy guys that would just go and just mutilate themselves and people would go nuts for it.  But luckily, I never really had to get into that scene.  You know, once in a while, you'd do it to kind of add some color and some emphasis to a certain angle that you're doing.  But as far as, you know, like, yeah, like the exploding barbed wire death matches, I didn't realize this is Terry Funk and some...  I think his name is Mr. Pogo, some fat Japanese guy who has no athletic ability whatsoever, but has no problem falling into real barbed wire. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah, there's no ropes on the ring.  It's a no rope or barbed wire match, yeah.  And so, yeah, if they fall into mines and there's...  Yeah, there's a flaming chair.  He's hitting the man with a flaming chair.  Yeah.  This is great.  Yeah, I see that.  Wow.  And they would do stadiums with that.  How is he not catching on fire while a man's beating him?  I'm not sure.  And it happened before.  I mean, once again, I mean, that's real fire, people, you know.  Wow.  So, um... 
[01:45:00]  That's crazy.  That fire just went out into the crowd.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  And you can see there's barbed wire.  There's no ropes.  There's barbed wire.  And it's not gimmick, like, where they've cut the tips.  That's real barbed wire when those guys fall into it.  Oh.  You know, and that's how they started getting to the thumbtacks thing and the staples and  the fluorescent light bulb tubes.  Shit.  It just started getting worse and worse.  Crazy.  Well, they're wearing shirts and long pants, too.  I wonder if that's just to kind of minimize the barbed wire.  Yeah, yeah.  To help it out a little bit.  But once again, you're still falling into, like, these...  Barbed wire.  Barbed wire. 
[01:45:30]  And I think he falls into it and explodes.  They would have, like, mines.  Like, they would make mines.  Mines.  What the fuck?  Yeah, exactly.  There's actually one that I saw one time where the loser got his head put into a little tub  of water with piranhas in it.  What is this?  It looks like a branding iron.  Yeah, it's...  Yeah, this was, like I said, this was the FMW thing.  Oh, wow.  So, thankfully, I never got into that.  And that's why, you know, it's more fun to be in a rock and roll band.  No shit.  That was the 90s. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, that was the 90s.  Well, it's sad to see some of these wrestlers, they feel like they have no other choice and  they have to go into some of these crazier leagues like this.  Yeah, I mean, this guy here is Terry Funk.  Yeah, we all know Terry Funk.  He was a legend, too.  Yeah, but he...  I think he did it in a smart way and probably made a lot of money from bringing his name  value in there.  But there was a lot of the younger Japanese guys, like you said, that would stick their  heads into a piranha bath.  I like how this has to be done outdoors.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like so much fire and shit.  It's a stadium crowd.  Like, they were drawing, you know, 30,000 people for these type of shows. 
[01:46:30]  Looks like he's going to breathe fire on them.  What happened to the league?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, see?  Oh, my God.  Exploding barbed wire.  So, let me just tell this to the people at home.  He took a branding iron, lit it on fire, breathed fire into the guy's face.  The guy fell back off the ring into an exploding minefield filled with barbed wire and bombs.  Wow.  This is dangerous.  That's just the aftermath of being busted on it.  Have you guys ever had Mick Foley in here?  A million times. 
[01:47:00]  Mick was the king of this.  Ask him about it next time.  He'll tell you about it.  He worked a match like this, and the company made all its money.  But typical wrestling, you're like a prostitute.  As soon as you blow your load, you're left on your own.  He came out of the dressing room, and the bus had left.  He had no ride home.  He had to take a taxi home after having a match like this.  That must have hurt him.  Lil' Vance, you have to pay for a cab.  Oh, yeah.  He has a skin flint.  That was the worst part of the match.  He told the stories on the air.  He would sleep at fans' houses and stuff to save money. 
[01:47:30]  He would sleep in hotel lobbies if you only had three hours to, you know, sometimes you  finish a show and you're having an early flight.  He would just say, can I use your couch for a while and just sit there, maybe doze off  for an hour or two in the Drury Inn.  And he wouldn't even go to, like, you know, the Waldorf Astoria couches.  He'd go to, like, the Red Roof Inn.  He was even a skin flint when he was freeloading.  Wow.  That's brutal.  That's obsessive, the desire.  I know a guy like that to save money.  It's either free of running out or it's saving every dollar. 
[01:48:00]  And it's like, what are you going to do with it when you have it?  Well, it's show business.  I mean, you know, it's so fleeting.  I think a lot of guys, when you've been doing it for a long time, like as long as all of  us, like, I save all my money because you never know.  It's like David Lee Roth would say, here today, gone later today.  And you're like, here today, gone later today.  Whoops-a-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Have you had him on the podcast yet?  I have not.  And I listened to him when he was on your show the last time.  And he's nuts.  I love it.  Out of his mind, yeah.  Actually, I think Florentine was in here with you guys talking to David Lee Roth.  So he's on my list.  I have a list of guys. 
[01:48:30]  Actually, Paul Stanley was on the list.  And I actually had him booked.  And he canceled mere hours before.  And I was like, no, I was so angry.  And he's doing every other little stupid show, but he won't do my stupid show.  He wouldn't do mine on the Boneyard either.  I think he was avoiding all music, most music channels.  Yeah, that's smart.  No, but my thinking is he, A, is sick and talking about Gene and the band and the original band.  And he probably knows that he doesn't need to talk to him once he gets to buy the book.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  I mean, but we are intelligent people.  We can talk about whatever you want. 
[01:49:00]  Right, right.  But just the fact he canceled like two hours before, I was so angry.  Did he do it or did someone else do it?  His people did it.  But I think, like you said, he was just sick of press.  There was so much press.  And the whole rock and roll.  Did you go to the rock and roll thing?  I know, but you texted me from it.  That's right.  I had a roast to do.  And it was a really good money gig for the whole weekend.  And I almost canceled so I could try to get a picture with the original four members.  But I'm like, I just can't throw out money.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't be that much of a fanboy.  Right, right, right.  And it would have been impossible.  I ended up getting a seat right on the, like there was like the, I guess you'd say the bleachers 
[01:49:30]  of the stands.  And I was in the front row of the stands with all the tables were all there where they all sat.  And I literally was just screaming, Paul Stanley, Paul Stanley, do my podcast.  Paul Stanley, Paul Stanley.  And he's finally like, all right, shut the fuck up.  He gave me the thumb to shut me up.  And Gene never even acknowledged me, which was great.  Of course.  But yeah, it was cool, man.  I wish they would have played.  But it was still cool to see the four original guys standing on stage.  And they walked up separately, right?  Just from the floor there. 
[01:50:00]  They did.  Well, they had a table.  The kids' table was Gene and Paul and their wives and kids.  And then Eric Singer, Tommy Thayer, and Bruce Kulik sat at the kiss table.  And then Ace sat over here and Peter sat over there.  And they kind of all walked up separately.  But like I said, once you saw them up there, the four guys, it was pretty cool.  It was worth seeing.  Did they say anything about each other?  They talked really good about each other.  But I mean, Paul's biggest thing was that there's a double standard.  And the rock and roll fame did the absolute bare minimum to let them in. 
[01:50:30]  Like nobody played.  They didn't have an all-star jam of bands playing Kiss tunes, which they do.  You know, Linda Ronstadt, she can't sing anymore.  So they had this all-star Stevie Nicks and Bonnie Raitt and Glenn Frey.  So they still could pay tribute for Kiss.  They went up there and got their award.  That was it at the end of it.  That was it.  No, yeah.  It was kind of lame.  That's weird.  And Paul was saying that there's a double standard in that Hall only allowed the four guys in the band.  But there's guys in that band that should be in there as well, that have been in the band for years. 
[01:51:00]  Or the whole 80s lineup, which sold millions of lineups, sold millions of records.  And then the Springsteen Band comes on, E Street Band.  And I swear to God, man, there's 15 guys up there.  And one of them played like, this guy played the first show in Asbury Park back in 1973.  Let's induct him in the Hall of Fame.  This guy comes up with a giant beard and hair.  He's talking for like 10 minutes.  Oh, shit.  Dude, it was so long.  I went up to the bar, so I drank it, I was so loaded at the end of the E Street Band's speeches.  Because it literally lasted over an hour. 
[01:51:30]  I heard it was over an hour.  It was crazy.  Every guy got five to ten minutes.  Every guy.  I'm like, hey, man, I appreciate the bass player in the Springsteen Band, but I don't need to hear about your Aunt Bessie,  how she gave you your first guitar when you were eight.  No one cared.  No one.  It was bad.  That was a bad one.  Well, Kirsten didn't want to let Kirsten anyway.  What's that mean?  They did the bare minimum.  Paul Stanley on Twitter, when you follow him on Twitter, everyone blames Gene, but Paul is a 50% fuck those Ace and Peter guy, too.  Yeah, it was Paul.  Something was said that just got to him that he's never going to forget. 
[01:52:00]  Peter and Ace have given us great radio.  They're hilarious.  So much fun.  It's so open.  And they don't take themselves seriously.  Ace especially, yeah.  And Peter Criss.  Peter talked in his book about, it's the biggest, I can't fuck, I don't know, his publicist is probably not doing the right job.  But he talked about getting a blowjob on the road, and then Ace went under the sheet.  And he didn't, because again, he didn't say exactly what was happening, but he was implying that Ace and another girl were under the sheet, possibly sucking his dick together. 
[01:52:30]  And it's the biggest, I can't believe I've just read that, I've ever read.  I asked him about it when he was in, and he was kind of like a little, he's like, ah, you know, I've got to read the book.  I don't think he wanted to actually verbalize it.  Right, right.  Wow.  I couldn't believe that.  Well, Ace has said that, I read something recently where he was talking about, like, you know, Paul claimed he was bisexual.  And Ace's like, well, you know, it was the 70s, and I was drunk and high, and I did it once or twice, and it wasn't me.  So, yes, it could be Ace.  Maybe he did it with Peter Criss.  And no one who did it once, you never say once or twice, when it's only once or twice. 
[01:53:00]  Never.  It's like when a cop pulls you over and says, have you been drinking?  Yes, I only had two beers.  I only had 30 beers.  No one has two beers.  I love Ace's excuse that it was the 70s.  Oh, yeah, everyone was sucking cock in the 70s.  It's okay.  It's fine.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, what a video.  Relax.  Right.  I couldn't believe that that didn't get more...  Wow, yeah, I forgot about that.  That is, it's the biggest shock I've ever had reading a rock biography, earning biography. 
[01:53:30]  Those guys just go off, too.  Like Ace was saying that, or maybe it was Peter, that Gene likes to, how should we put this, engage in oral activities with girls that are on their menstrual cycles.  And then he gets off on that.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah.  Totally.  They're just going off.  Like, fuck, dude.  Like, it's just bad news, right?  He said something about Gene having an outbreak, too, during a show, a herpes outbreak.  Like, what he implied, I don't know if he said it, but he said herpenic, or...  In my opinion...  Well, yeah, it was just something he said, it was along those lines. 
[01:54:00]  And I'm like, you know Gene Bred that, and he's probably like, fuck you, motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  Those guys have each said at least one thing, where the other guys are like...  That's what I mean.  So, for them to get up on stage, you know, 40 years, that's probably a lot of stuff going on underneath...  Oh, yeah.  Underneath the sheets.  You know, yeah, exactly.  I love Peter and Ace, but I also, you can't discount Gene and Paul's side, too.  It's like, they did keep the band going, and in the 80s, if it wasn't for that, they would have just...  Died making 81.  Have you ever had them in here?  Oh, we've had every single combination, I think.  Never together, never all four. 
[01:54:30]  We had three out of the four once.  Really?  I wasn't here for that.  We had Gene, Paul, and Ace.  Ace, maybe?  And Ace, right.  Peter Chris was...  No one knew where he was at that point.  Remember when they thought they found him under a bridge or something?  Oh, yeah.  Remember?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it came out on one of the talk shows, and it turned out it was a phony?  It was a phony saying it was Peter Chris.  What show is that?  Do you guys remember that?  Donahue.  Was it Phil Donahue?  Donahue, yeah.  Wow, Donahue.  Do you remember this?  No.  They found Peter Chris that no one heard from for a long time, and then this guy claimed  to be Peter Chris and claimed to be homeless, and they brought him... 
[01:55:00]  Was it Phil Donahue?  Yeah, they brought him on the Donahue show.  Do you have a clip of this?  It's hilarious.  And then confronted him with the real Peter Chris.  Oh, shit.  Are you ready for the real kiss?  And then, yeah, that's exactly.  It was the bum, but it wasn't...  See, I don't know if it was imposter...  I don't know.  You got one of these clips that might work?  It's worth playing.  This sounds old.  Rock imposter.  What is this?  VH1.  Yeah, that's going to be tough.  That's what I was giving.  Skid Row reveals. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  But supposedly, yeah.  Yeah, he was on rough times.  I can't believe I don't remember this one, Ian.  Don't remember this.  I don't even remember this.  It's really good to remember this shit.  No, no, I'm surprised.  Yeah, they said they fell on that bridge.  But the guy didn't even really look anything like him.  Yeah, that was Peter Chris's dyed blonde hair.  It was not a good idea.  There's not a better clip somewhere.  If you're fine with Sam before you wrap up.  Scott Shannon sent me, because he's friends with those guys for years, and he sent me as  just a gift, a copy of the first photo ever taken of them in makeup. 
[01:56:00]  It's like a really old school, like, rock club photo from 200 yards away.  You said it's one of the first times they wore makeup.  It might be, yeah.  It's the first known picture of them in full gear.  When they came walking by here, Paul and Jean in full makeup and everything, it was pretty  fucking impressive when you see them that up close.  Yeah, I mean, that's what I mean, man.  Like a giant cartoon character.  Here's the guy.  Here's the guy.  It doesn't even look anything like him.  He looks like Paul Williams. 
[01:56:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  The article claimed that a down on his luck, Chris, was drunk, broke, and homeless.  Lifelong Kiss fan, Tom Arnold, saw the article, and went down to the set of monics appeared  to try and help the troubled drunk.  He tried to help Peter Chris.  I saw a guy with about 10 other homeless guys around him.  He's like an entourage, you know, like Elvis, you know, and I figured that's got to be him.  But it wasn't.  It was Christopher Dickinson, a homeless man who had passed himself off as Peter Chris for  years.  I do remember this guy.  It's like Tennille. 
[01:57:00]  And then Peter Chris was like, you know, wait a minute, you know.  Dude, that's not me.  The real Peter Chris was quietly raising a family in Redondo Beach, California.  A month after the article was published, Peter Chris appeared on The Donoghue Show to expose  the front, clear his name, and confront his imposter.  How you doing?  Why couldn't you impersonate like the Lone Ranger or Tonno or something like that?  The two Peters made their piece on the show. 
[01:57:30]  The real Peter Chris went on to sue the star for libel.  They eventually settled out of court.  The Donoghue Show to expose the people.  The Donoghue Show to expose the people.  Wow.  Nice.  Wow.  There you go.  Rock Imposter.  There you go.  It's pretty good.  Wow.  Yeah, that was funny.  So there's a story.  Now you know.  Are you writing a book?  Yeah, my third book, actually, which is kind of dumb.  It's like three books, really, but it's turned out really good.  A lot of these stories we discussed are in it. 
[01:58:00]  It comes out in October.  Good for you.  Yeah, the first two were like New York Times bestsellers.  So I have a, you know, it's a long project to write a book, though, man.  Because you're actually writing your own book.  Yeah, I don't write, even the picture captions, the dust jacket, like I'm a control freak.  So every single little thing I have to be, you know, in charge of.  But they've been, you know, I kind of carved out a little niche for myself with it.  But it takes about nine or ten months to do books.  What's this one about?  What are you focusing on?  It's like a trilogy, so it's like the third in, you know, the first one started in the early years, 
[01:58:30]  then kind of the mid years, and this one goes from 07 to 2012.  And, you know, all the experiences with the WB, with Fozzy, and all the stuff I've done, you know, outside of that, too.  Getting suspended.  Yeah, that's in there, getting suspended.  The UFO razor blade story's in there.  So a lot of stories.  If you like those stories, kids, you'll like my book coming out October 13th.  That's cool, man.  It's called The Best in the World at What? I have no idea.  But the fact that you can cut your head with a razor and then get punched in it is fucking... 
[01:59:00]  I can't...  The head bleeds like a motherfucker, so...  I can't get a hold of that.  The fucking...  Well, another thing, too, is you take aspirin, which thins your blood.  Oh, thins it out.  So you can get a little bit more color.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they would be the guys, just the face completely covered in blood.  A crimson mask, they would call it.  A crimson mask, yes.  He's got a crimson mask.  That would always be the big thing.  Dusty Rhodes look great covered in blood because of that blonde hair and that...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think that's why those guys dyed their hair like that.  That's why Peter Criss dyed his hair that way.  So people could see.  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  Flair had that, too.  The real blonde hair.  You could see every little bit of red in there.  Yeah, yeah.  True.  Yeah, absolutely, man.  Well, we've got to take a break.  Chris Jericho, man.  Always a pleasure.  Always fun and happy win, man.  New single, Lights Goin'.  Actually, we're playing at the Gramercy Theater tomorrow night with Buck Cherry.  Nice.  Buck Cherry's awesome.  Yeah, they're a great band, man.  Are they still putting out new music?  Yeah, yeah.  They are.  I'm a little behind with Buck Cherry, but I always like those guys.  We toured with them in Australia in December and had a great tour.  It's a good mix.  Right.  So we're doing the Gramercy and then we're doing Long Island Huntington. 
[02:00:00]  Is it Huntington?  The Paramount.  The Paramount.  That's it.  It's an amazing...  Have you played there yet?  I have not.  We did the Emporium, but never the Paramount.  It's a beautiful venue.  And then we also have a listening party, I'm going to say too, if I don't say this, I'll  get in trouble, for our new record, which will be at Idle Hands in the city on Wednesday,  May 28th.  So you get to hear the whole new record.  What record is this?  How many?  This is number six for us.  Yeah.  All right.  Number six.  So yeah, Idle Hands, I guess, is a pretty cool place.  So what we do is we have people come in.  No listening devices allowed. 
[02:00:30]  All right.  You leave them at the door and you come hang out with us listening to the record.  It's tough to keep the music from the fans in the face.  Yeah, yeah, it is.  But we had a couple of them, and people are usually pretty respectful.  They're pretty cool.  There's nobody sitting there with their phone, you know, having it on.  Where's the band big?  What countries are your big countries right now?  The States is getting good, but right now it's the UK has always been the best.  UK and Australia are our best.  But we're going to Download, which is the big festival in the UK, and we're main stage  this year, which is great.  That's with Linkin Park and Fall Out Boy.  They have such a weird list.  It's Linkin Park, Fall Out Boy, Killswitch Engaged, Fozzy, and Dying Fetus. 
[02:01:00]  Yes.  So Dying Fetus doing big numbers in the UK as well.  But yeah, that's always been our place.  And you love Australia?  Australia is great too.  France.  But the States is getting good for us too now, which is good.  We never really toured a lot in the States, and now we have over the last few years.  How's Lemmy?  Because they played Coachella, which I was happy to hear that they played.  We did play Coachella, but we just did Carolina Rebellion and Rock in the Range, which are  big festivals here.  Rock in the Range is this week, but they did not play. 
[02:01:30]  They, I guess, took themselves off the bill, so I'm not sure how he's doing.  I think he's coming to the end of the line, you know?  As far as he's not...  I saw him at Valken last year in Germany when he did the half-an-hour set and cut it short.  He's very weak, you know, playing the bass and singing at the same time.  It's kind of getting harder for him.  The fact that it took, was he 67 or 65?  He's almost, I think he's 69 now.  Is he 69?  Yeah, I think so.  Fuck, man.  The fact it took him that long to finally start getting...  Slowing down. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Actually, I saw him last year at Valken after the show, and he had to cut the set off short  because it was super hot, like 110 degrees.  He did a good job, but he's like, that's all I can do right now.  I go backstage, and he's sitting there, and guess what he's got?  Jack.  Jack.  I'm like, dude, what are you doing?  He goes, I can't be boring.  This is boring.  It's fucking boring.  And I think maybe now he realizes that maybe he needs to be a little bit more boring.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, great guy, though.  Couldn't ask for a better guy.  A really sweet guy.  Jack Daniels and Pringle.  He was, I know, sour cream and onion, potato chips.  And Jack Daniels. 
[02:02:30]  It's a Canadian thing.  The worst fucking unhealthy guy ever.  I had a limo ride with him once.  We went to do a radio show together, and he's like, would you like a drink?  So we've got a limo with Lemmy.  He reaches in the ice, and his hands are dirty, and they're all crackled, and he reaches in,  and grabs the ice and throws it in the glass.  And I'm like, well, any kind of dip theory or dysentery that I get will be killed by the  straight jacket.  And even if it doesn't, hey, man, I got it from Lemmy.  So that's not a bad deal.  It is like a thing that you have to do. 
[02:03:00]  I remember it was pretty early one morning.  We were doing a radio show in L.A.  and we were talking to Lemmy, and Lemmy's like, poor Jack Daniels.  And I'm like, yeah, I'll have one.  Yeah, you have to, right?  I have to, just to say I did.  Exactly.  I think Lemmy has a drinking problem.  Yeah, everybody that's hung out with him has a story of drinking problem.  Yeah, that's right, and he outlasts everybody.  Apparently, no one ever sees him drunk.  He's just always perfect intake.  Exactly, exactly. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, guys, so May 13th tomorrow at the Gramercy here in the city.  And for tour dates, we go to fozzyrock.com.  It's all over the country.  Chris Jericho is always a great guest.  Don't forget about Chris's podcast.  Talk is Jericho on podcast1.com.  I like your podcast.  Thanks, man.  And also, I am Jericho on Twitter.  I am Jericho on Twitter.  May 30th and Huntington at the Paramount.  And Idle Hands, 528 Wednesday for the listening party.  So you took your kid to an Aussie show. 
[02:04:00]  I'll tell it to you next time.  Believe it, it's a crazy one.  You're not going to want to miss it.  And we'll be back after these messages.  Nice.  Jimmy's missing this.  I hate this song.  You don't like this one?  This is a damn good one.  I want to thank Chris Jericho for stopping by. 
[02:04:30]  He's awesome, man.  I just tweeted that the guy can talk about anything.  He's always a great guest.  Always a great guest.  What?  I love the conversations that go on down the hall.  What happens?  We just miss those little things that it's just Sam and Danny and Sal comes out.  You just listen to them talking.  You want to bring Danny in?  No, probably not.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  I'm positive.  But it's Monday.  We like to beat a dead horse on this show, but there's been three of them that we've been massacring. 
[02:05:00]  Sure, it's Monday.  I mean, we could all use a pick-me-up.  Danny tends to give us that, doesn't he?  No, he doesn't actually.  His lack of presence is a wonderful, delightful pick-me-up.  Yes, that is a good pick-me-up.  Okay, all right.  Contributes very little.  I guess I misread that one.  I thought for sure.  All right.  What was the conversation about?  Well, it was a little thing.  I guess when they give little tours around here, Danny was calling the voice tracking little booths,  those tiny little booths with the mic and the little board, 
[02:05:30]  and you piece together the music and you talk over it,  he calls it a star chamber because that's where the magic happens.  This is a microphone.  It doesn't mean there's magic happening.  It's a dud chamber.  That's why they're in there.  There was some fat guy sitting in there doing some tracking,  and I just looked.  I go, that doesn't look like magic happening right there.  But he's so into it.  When he walks around here, it's all about radio. 
[02:06:00]  You've got to, you know, whether you hate the guy or not,  boy, you've just got to respect the drive this man has for radio.  So why hasn't he ever had a career?  I don't know.  You would have thought he would have tripped over a career by now at least.  It just goes to show you there's no justice in this world.  It just goes to show you there is.  A guy like that should have a really good position here because he's a cheerleader,  for God's sake. 
[02:06:30]  He loves it.  He is.  But they don't give a fuck in the end.  He knows everything about radio.  He knows how to, you know, put those songs together.  He called it a star chamber?  Those are the star chambers.  See, it's a bit in a way.  But I really need to ask him about that.  And I'm not bringing him in this time to annoy Jimmy.  I need to know why he calls it a star chamber really fast.  He's right there.  Why can't we just ask him off the air and then relay the message?  Go ask him and then come back.  Too late.  Hi, guys. 
[02:07:00]  He's like, go ask him.  He turns around.  He's right behind him.  Go ask him.  Don't sit down.  This is going to be very quick.  Please don't sit down.  And you're getting lazy because you know a real broadcaster never sits.  That's why we're all sitting by the way.  I said I was just adjusting the microphone.  So why do you call it a star chamber?  That's where the magic happens.  We create the magic.  But most microphones, especially at this place, there's not much magic.  No, we create the magic.  He was telling me that the whole thing of just, you know, we were talking, taking that list of songs. 
[02:07:30]  It's just a list.  It's just songs.  But now you're piecing it together, adding that personality and making the magic that  comes out of the Sirius XM speakers.  We play great songs and the DJ makes them that much greater.  That's what I like to say.  And you become a friend.  You become a friend.  No, the friend thing.  A friend.  You become a friend.  I mean, anybody can just play Moonlight Feels Right by Starbuck.  But just the way to say, maybe it was a summer night and you were cruising along with the 
[02:08:00]  wait, the first girl.  Why don't you show us how to make that song better?  Well, that's a nice song, Starbuck.  Could you find that for me, please?  Boy, I tell you, it didn't get much better than this back in the summertime of 1976.  You were cruising around with that special friend.  Your first love, maybe.  You had the top down.  Your left arm sitting on the door.  Your right arm on the wheel.  And you were cracking up Starbuck.  We're in England.  But that didn't make the song better. 
[02:08:30]  No, I created a picture of memories.  But you're painting the picture that wasn't that guy's memory.  Might have been.  Might have been.  No, but that song alone just brings back the memory.  Yeah, but again, you enhance.  I just enhanced.  He's painting a picture, maybe, that the other guy would think of as like, yeah, that would  have been nice.  What about the guy that's just finger-popping some slob on a Tuesday night when the song  came on?  Why does it always have to be completely romantic?  Right.  Finger-popping some slob that knows this is the best she's going to get. 
[02:09:00]  You know, everybody wants romance, and everybody wants that special feeling.  Everybody wants to remember.  Right.  Their first love.  I wonder if I was someone slob.  I probably was.  I bet you no one, I bet you every person alive has been someone slob.  I've never been anything but.  I'm somebody's error.  Somebody's mistake.  I'm right before they get into a real relationship.  Yeah.  You like to think that, you know, you weren't used, but I think every single person has been  used.  You get a little used. 
[02:09:30]  And it's been the slob.  Yeah.  It's a shame.  Good for you, but I don't believe it.  Thank you, guys.  I appreciate it.  I think just the song itself brings back the memories.  It's a good song, though.  You know, if you say something like, oh, wow, this should bring back memories, and then  that allows the person in their car to go, yeah, my memory is, and they start thinking  about their memory.  But if you don't even have a memory of that song, this conjures up this just imagined thing  that romance, a little fun, and it might remind you of some other song or some other 
[02:10:00]  time that you had.  Right, Danny?  Exactly.  Also, you could say this is one of the first songs in the top 40 to feature a xylophone.  How many hit records feature a xylophone?  Yeah, there you go.  There's a little xylophone.  There you go.  I know one.  Yeah.  Haircut 100.  Okay, so that's two.  I know another one.  Ding, ding, ding, ding.  Hold on.  I have an idea.  I have a good radio saver.  Oh, yeah, you do, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah, Jim?  Yes.  You go down the hall, and you make a list of, say, the top 50 greatest xylophone songs.  Wow. 
[02:10:30]  50.  But if he does 50, he's not going to be back until at least tomorrow.  No, but I'm just saying, what you do is, after you have that list, you go downstairs to  the list, and you walk onto 6th Avenue.  And you read the list while facing away from traffic, until a truck plows into you.  Say.  Say, that doesn't sound like fun.  It does the job that the first car didn't do, obviously.  Yeah, that doesn't sound like fun.  All right, golly.  I know you don't work blue, but could you redo that same song you just talked up and make  it a slob that's being finger-banked? 
[02:11:00]  No, I don't work blue.  How about you try that?  How about, I did it sort of.  Finger-poppin' time.  Hank Ballard and the Midnighters, great 50s record.  Hey, now, hey, now.  Finger-poppin' time.  You ever hear that song?  Yeah, but that's finger-poppin'.  Finger-poppin', right.  No, no.  That's the double entendre.  He was talking about sticking some digits in some smelly holes.  I don't think so.  A little finger-poppin' song.  Yeah.  It didn't work blue.  You can't redo that memory for the people out there that were just finger-poppin' a slob?  No, no, no.  I can't paint myself in that kind of light, especially this time of year, communion season.  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I tell you, we got everything going on at the communion parties.  Playing a little Huggy Bear.  Yeah, a lot of communion parties.  Yeah, we played Huggy Bear this weekend.  That was fun.  Had a big group of kids.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Oh, shoot.  What happened?  How do I get hired?  I think we could bring up the pool.  Do they need someone to massage their legs?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Sam's right down the hall.  He never runs.  Rub their legs.  Oh, and Sal.  Sal's running after him.  Sal's running after you.  What's that about?  Jumping around.  Oh, we can hardly get it for Sal. 
[02:12:00]  All right.  Sam's putting something in front of the opster.  What's this?  What is it?  I hope it's a resignation.  What?  It's always a die.  Yeah.  Quit.  Get fired.  Quit.  Or get some type of illness.  Shoot yourself.  Or shoot yourself.  Well, you can't say anything nice.  No.  I hope Sam's putting down some good news.  Or something gay.  Yeah.  What's this, Sam?  I haven't heard it, but Sal's got a lot of confidence in it.  Uh-oh.  It is last night's broadcast from somebody. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, okay.  Probably me on 60s on 6.  I believe.  Oh, is that?  What's your name?  Shithead?  70s.  It's Dennis the 70s Menace.  Oh, right.  Dennis the 70s Menace.  So this was your 70s show, then?  It might be 70s, might be 60s, whatever you got.  I don't know if this is working.  Maybe it's upside down.  I'll just try it this way.  I don't know.  I can't know.  Saved by the CD player.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Okay.  We got it to work, unfortunately.  We're Sal. 
[02:13:00]  If Sal brought this in, he should be part of this.  This is Sal's bit.  Where's Sal?  Go ahead.  I got a call from Seattle while we wait for Sal to come in studio.  We're getting another camping trip together.  Russell in Seattle.  Go ahead.  Yeah, I was wondering if you could intro maybe a newer song, like Nine Inch Nails.  Like, I want to fuck you like an animal or something.  Yeah, can you do that for us?  Don't know that song.  It's not on the hard drive of HIT, so I can't.  It's called Closer.  It was a big hit.  You know the song. 
[02:13:30]  Come on, Dennis.  To all the people who want to violate somebody out there.  I'd have to listen to the ramp.  Reminds me of when I was rolling on some Molly.  Finger banging some whore.  No?  Sounds like it's a ripoff of the stroke.  Everybody get that beat coming out.  Billy Squire, right?  Billy Squire is 64 today.  Right.  You don't like this one?  No.  I like it.  Hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell. 
[02:14:00]  Why don't you like this one?  It's just fucking horrendous.  Yeah.  No?  No.  Academy Award winning artist right here.  That's right.  I don't say he's without talent.  I just don't know.  For the Facebook movie?  I think that was it, right?  Yep.  What was the name of that movie?  I forgot already.  The Social.  Facebook movie.  All right, right, right.  It's called Facebook movie.  Facebook movie.  I want to fuck you like and then I look. 
[02:14:30]  I want to feel you from the inside.  I like the other one better.  Which one?  You know, bow down before the one you're going to get what you deserve.  Oh, yeah.  And then this part starts, yeah.  You can make closer tonight.  The videos were always very weird.  Little pig's head spinning around in a spike and a doll face with one eye opening slowly. 
[02:15:00]  It's just creepy.  All right.  Thanks, Dennis.  That was great.  Denny Falcone.  Okay, boys.  You have a go.  Thanks, sir.  Go make some more magic happen.  We'll take care of it.  In the star chamber.  In the star chamber.  We do have his air check.  Go ahead.  Do a little critique here.  You'd be like the PD.  Air check meeting.  Air check meeting.  Get off the air.  Air check meeting.  Sal, why do you have confidence in this, knowing that Jimmy hates Dennis Falcone?  Well, it's very interesting with the way, you know, Danny does a good job when he's 
[02:15:30]  here on the show, but hearing him like in his real element, I don't think he did as good  as I thought he would have.  Oh, wow.  Shit.  Wow.  There's a former intern.  What are some of the issues?  Considering you've been in radio, what, 12 months maybe?  He's been here for a cup of coffee.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just, the mix is like the funniest fucking thing.  Why?  You can't hear him.  You can't.  You cannot hear him.  Are you buried in the mix?  No, sounded fine in the studio.  Go ahead. 
[02:16:00]  You've got to run your board.  All right, let me hear this.  Play a couple of them.  Series 6M, 70s on 7.  The song Hang On Snoopy by the McCoys is being under consideration, and it's going to happen.  It's going to be the rock and roll state song.  That's because it's without any of the compression.  That's because you're listening to the board mix.  Yapping through the music.  You're listening to the board mix.  There's no compression or processing.  No process.  No, there's no compression or processing.  I am struggling to hear you.  Of course you are.  I feel uncomfortable because I feel like I have to concentrate too much. 
[02:16:30]  No, they're talking to the music.  They play it at me.  Why are you talking over it?  Listen to me.  I'd like to hear the song.  Because, again, when it goes through the chain, the audio chain.  All right, listen when this kicks in, though.  It's funny.  It's going to be the rock and roll state song.  It's going to be the rock and roll state song.  It's because it's not.  There's no process.  What are you doing?  Why don't you just say, here's the song, and then play the song and sit there.  It'll be the book.  It's part of the magic. 
[02:17:00]  It's not magic.  He's creating magic.  Do you talk over it?  He's creating magic.  No, he's not.  He's being a friend.  When you're watching a comic, you don't talk over the setup.  You just back up with a punchline.  He's being your friend, Jimmy.  He's your friend.  Yeah, my friend shuts up when I'm listening to music.  You don't want a friend on the radio?  No, I don't.  You sure?  No.  Oh, no.  I don't.  To keep your company in the car, right, Danny?  I wouldn't mind that, but just don't talk over the music.  I hate that.  I feel the post coming, and I'm like, here it is.  He's going to.  You're just listening.  It just makes me nervous that they're not going to, like, you know, stop in time. 
[02:17:30]  Like, oh, no.  The words are coming.  There's a lot of anxiety listening to music jocks.  It's like when people are talking during the movie trailers, and you're like, oh, my God.  They're going to talk throughout the whole movie.  The whole movie.  This is going to be terrible.  Yes, yes.  Who's the best at hitting the post you ever saw?  The best at hitting the post that I ever saw?  I guess Dan Ingram would probably be the best.  Dan Ingram.  He was great.  What about Ron Lundy?  Ron Lundy.  All the WABC guys.  All the WABC guys.  California, the real Don Steele. 
[02:18:00]  It was effortless for those guys, because, quite frankly, it didn't take much effort.  What about Bibi?  I am Bibi.  I am Bibi.  I am Bibi.  I am Bibi.  W-E-N-B-C.  N-B-C.  Stretch out that N until you hit the post.  Oh, yeah.  Can we hear, I want to hear, what's his name, Dan Ingram hitting a post.  I want to hear what that's supposed to sound like.  Dan Ingram, go, go, go.  And he's got one of those voices.  Yeah.  Is he alive or dead?  We've probably done this.  He's alive.  He's now in Florida.  Yeah.  Hi there, Kimo Sabe. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, Elton John on CBS FM, Party Songs Weekend.  I'm Dan Ingram, proud to be with you.  We know that, of course.  Back to 1959.  That was 33 years ago.  You were one, huh?  Sure you were.  Right.  Dion Ingram, it's on CBS FM 101.1.  Each time.  How about that?  Only on CBS FM 101.1, New York's Aldi station.  Right.  Get some of these for yourself.  Another example of how American Airlines is bringing value back to air travel. 
[02:19:00]  Hooray!  Remember your favorite Aldi station.  He's very scary.  Whoa!  101, CBS FM.  Is this how busy?  That was a young Denny Falcone.  You guys are missing.  Too bad at home you can't see this.  Oh, my God.  Just look up douche on YouTube.  That was young Denny Falcone in the studio.  Bopping along with the music. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, we're all needy and shit with a Mets cap on.  Backwards, backwards.  What, you got a mustache you sporting there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's awful.  Wow.  Running the board, cart machines next to you.  Look at you.  22 years ago, Denny.  Long time ago, yeah.  Long time ago.  Hey, Dan Ingram.  Good for him.  Wow.  Good for Denny.  Can you rewind with the music though?  Because you can see Denny bopping to the music.  He's bopping to the music.  Yeah, he's really into it. 
[02:20:00]  Do you remember that moment?  Yeah, Art Vulo was making those videos, came into the studio with a camera.  Oh.  Vulo video?  Yeah.  Did Art ever come in and record your show?  No.  He's radio's best friend, you know.  No, he's not our best friend.  He didn't want anything to do with us.  He's radio's best friend, you know.  This guy went around and videotaped jocks.  Yeah, he's great.  He'll come in.  Next time he's in to visit Brucey, I could send him in.  We never got a call or an email from him.  Art, I could hook it up.  No, that's okay.  I'm pretty close with him.  That's all right.  Can we make a nice little reel for Opie and Anthony?  Of course. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, that'd be great.  Well, now that we heard Dan Ingram, why don't we hear another break from Denny from last  night?  Yeah.  We couldn't even hear you. 
[02:21:00]  I know, but you're listening before on his cell phone.  Dennis the 70s.  It should be, I'm Dennis and I suck penance.  And just the punch on there was, I said, if I do get a call from you, it might sound like  I'm underwater.  Yeah, we heard it.  We heard it.  Don't worry.  We heard it.  Don't worry.  We heard it.  Had you really spilled seltzer?  Yes, I did.  And did he say, I'm Dennis, your 70s menace?  Yes.  He said, I'm Dennis, the 70s menace.  I kind of made it personal.  Yes, you're personal.  What makes you menacing? 
[02:21:30]  What's that?  What makes you menacing?  It's just a rhyming thing that everybody did back in his cell.  I'm Dennis and I should drown in Venice.  Guys would have names like that.  Crazy Jack London.  It'd be nothing crazy about him except his name.  Right.  Not at all.  Thousand ass.  The next track.  Dennis is boogieing this weekend, but we can't hear him.  Some about Aztec, New Mexico. 
[02:22:00]  You're just listening before the process.  What I do is I always pick out three cities.  When I get an up-tempo song, an R&B song, I do what I call a boogie check.  He does a boogie check.  Is that why you look up your nostrils in the mirror?  Exactly.  Do a boogie check?  I hope you do one with a desert eagle.  You're just listening before anything goes out through any of the processing and stuff.  I don't get what a boogie check is.  How do you not get what a boogie check is? 
[02:22:30]  I've been better.  A boogie check.  Damn.  Would you ever like to do a guest DJ show?  I have no.  Why not?  A classic vinyl?  Make some magic.  Yeah.  I gave up on that.  That one I gave up on about three years ago.  I actually went to Steve Blatter and Rob Cross and said, hey man, I want to do a music show,  but I want to be able to play whatever the fuck.  Right.  And then they gave me a list of songs to pick from.  I'm like, all right, goodbye.  Well, couldn't you pick whatever you wanted to from that list? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, but I wanted to mix the old with the new, maybe throw a little rap in, just whatever  I'm feeling.  Would you be the best mix from yesterday and today?  It'd be a mixed bag.  Mixed bag.  Like Jack FM.  So they're like, good news, you know, the channel said yes, and then he gave me about  20 pages of songs I could choose from.  Nice.  No, it's from a format.  And it's every song they already play.  Yeah, but that's part of the library.  Well, so let them do it their way.  I would do a 70s, I would do a 70s show. 
[02:23:30]  That'd be fun.  Yeah.  I could just relay stories of the 70s from me.  Like, you know, hey, I remember this one when my dad was driving drunk down the Ortega  highway.  I thought I was going to die.  And I think that's where my anxiety comes from.  We are family.  And we are family.  Something like that.  That'd be good.  That'd be funny.  Yeah, it'd be great.  But they wouldn't allow that on the 70s show.  Hey.  So we should do it ourselves and then just make it a 70s day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we'll intro some songs.  I remember the spaghetti hitting the wall of this one when dad got mad at mom and threw 
[02:24:00]  the spaghetti at the wall and started cursing at her.  And mom finally called dad a fuck face.  I remember that.  I ran into my room crying and said I had a bellyache.  I always had a bellyache.  Ha, ha, ha.  You gotta love the 70s.  That's why I drink now.  Just like my old man.  Ah, 70s.  See?  He had a rant.  He had a rant.  Not a post, but he hit the 70s.  It's got a 33-second post this week.  It's got a long time to talk. 
[02:24:30]  You know how many seconds it is?  Yeah.  He knows.  You have to know.  Now it's coming off.  I mean, this is good if you were doing something on the community bulletin board or maybe a PSA.  There you go.  Wow.  And then we get this last night.  Sirius XM 77.  One of your fans, Brian Cranston from the TV show Breaking Bad.  He is a new version of Godzilla.  And they say it's like the 1998 version.  You can't hear it.  It can't be.  I guess that's good.  What? 
[02:25:00]  Talking about Brian Cranston.  He's in the...  Yeah, you're just giving out a little information.  A little info.  A little info for everybody.  A little info.  You hear their tidbits?  Why did you choose to talk about that during that song?  What was the tie-in?  Well, because you try to do something contemporary and, you know, to relate to the audience.  You don't want to just always live back in the day.  Ah.  You know, and just be a history lesson.  Wow.  That had nothing to do with Godzilla, though.  No, no.  What's that?  Brian Cranston.  I turned it at, you know, because he was in Breaking Bad.  Right.  And he's in Godzilla. 
[02:25:30]  He's got a...  Yeah, but what did that have to do with the song?  Right.  Nothing.  It just gave me 12 seconds.  So you should have picked a song that might have been a little better.  You don't like the tidbits, Jimmy?  No, they stink.  What was the name of that song?  Everlasting Love.  Carl Carlton.  The 70s version.  You know, there was a version of that song in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and I believe you two  also.  Wow.  That's what you should have said.  Well, no.  You know what?  And then they play.  Because we've played that song so many times, you kind of try to reinvent it and do a little 
[02:26:00]  information.  You should say, here's a song that I like a lot.  You've probably heard it many times before.  Oh, wow.  I won't talk over it, though.  Sal, any comments?  You put this together.  Well, this is...  We're stuck with Denny because of you.  What do you got to add?  This is from the help of our friend, Lauren.  She was able to help me out with a lot of this.  She actually gave me a whole other break.  A whole other show, sorry.  And I have another 10 tracks if you guys want to hear.  Wow.  Maybe.  But Denny does a good job with cross-promotion.  Oh, yeah.  He's such a company guy. 
[02:26:30]  Almost every other break is like, hey, there's another channel.  Like, if I'm listening to you, go listen to something.  No, no.  You're supposed to do it maybe once an hour.  Does Scott Greenstein even nod your way?  Yeah.  He always says hi.  Hey, what's going on?  What are you working on?  That's everything.  Oh.  Really?  He always says hi.  That's how he sees it.  Like Rupert Pupkin saw Jerry talking to him.  Finally, one more.  Mother's Day is apparently eat what you want day.  Yeah.  What?  It was also eat what you want.  You know, there's always something in the prep sheets that's saying today is also. 
[02:27:00]  Ah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  Sirius XM 70s on 7.  Happy Mother's Day.  Dennis the 70s menace.  Play the 70s.  It's commercial free.  And not only.  I don't like your nickname.  It's horrendous.  You're not menacing.  You're not very menacing.  No.  Maybe I should play like a chainsaw behind it.  Something.  Dennis the 70s field mouse.  Right.  Something.  Maybe it could be good nature, but you've got to have some kind of menacing going on.  Is this a rhyming thing?  That's not very menacing. 
[02:27:30]  Field mouse.  Field mouse.  He's slight.  I'm Dennis the 70s nit.  Right.  There's nothing menacing about you.  Oh, Dennis.  Stop saying it.  Dennis the 70s cuticle.  That should be your nickname.  Right.  You're like the nicest guy around here.  Yeah.  You're so nice it's kind of fucking disgusting.  Yes.  I'm 70s.  I'll try to be meaner.  Exactly.  Well, if you're going to have the nickname menacing,  you're going to have to do something with it. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah, but Dennis the menace wasn't a menacing kid.  No, he was menacing to Mr. Wilson.  To Mr. Wilson.  And like he was always, yeah, he was always like into some,  there's nothing you're doing that's the slightest bit dangerous.  The only thing you're menacing to is the ears.  What is, yeah, why?  And I think everyone's waiting for you to be menacing if they're listening to you.  They're like, wow, this guy says he's Dennis the menace.  That's a good tease.  Maybe if I come up with something.  Literally just doing what you're told.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:28:30]  You couldn't sound nicer.  You're the absolute opposite of a menace.  Right.  Yeah.  Like you're dependable.  Yes.  Yeah.  How about dependable 70s Dennis?  Dependable Dennis.  Oh, yeah.  Dependable Dennis.  Your 70s pal, dependable Dennis.  We don't want to see that, though.  I got one that would work.  Dennis the douche.  Oh, shit.  That's alliteration.  And it would work.  I wouldn't say.  Dennis the douche.  Yes.  Oh, this one coming in.  Dennis the free food menace.  Oh.  Apparently you're menacing when there's free food around and you're trying to grab it up.  True. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  Dennis the dumpster diver.  Dennis, are you going to eat that?  You're going to eat that?  Falcone.  You're going to finish that?  Oh, finish that.  That's right.  You're going to finish that?  Yes.  Hi, I'm Dennis.  You're 70s.  Take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take.  Is he still eating everyone's food?  Oh, yeah.  We're asking?  His asking has gone down.  Okay.  But he still has a Hawkeye when it comes to all that stuff.  Why?  For sure.  Why would you eat someone else's food after they're done?  No, if they have half of it left.  If you say you have a wrap.  You have a wrap.  Right, right.  Half the wrap.  Cut in half. 
[02:29:30]  It's still wrapped.  Oh, we got a wrap.  Are you going to finish that?  Grand no.  Yeah.  All right, let me get to the end of this, then we can get him out of here.  The 70s is commercial free, and not only is it Mother's Day, understand, it's also  Eat What You Want Day.  Hold on.  I was not able to find any cards that say, Happy Eat What You Want Day.  Let's see what I want to eat.  All right.  We'll take out a couple of pork chops, wrap them in bacon, and deep-prime, and smother them  with garlic sauce.  How's that sound?  Terrible.  Friday night, it was late.  I was walking you home.  We got down to the gate and I was...  What?  I remember the music.  I saw.  That is a great one, isn't it? 
[02:30:00]  Little River Band.  Little River Band.  Very good.  Or, to be funny, you used to call them the Yellow River Band.  Ah, piss.  That's a little racy.  Timo, you wouldn't say it.  You'd say, hey, Yellow River Band.  No, that's menace.  That's a menace right there.  That's a bit menacing.  That's a little menacing.  All right, maybe I'll throw more of those in.  You should throw more of those in.  Dennis the Piss Menace.  Yes.  How about Piss Boy Dennis Valcombe?  Yeah, exactly.  How about UTI?  Dennis the UTI.  And I'm kind of honored because I had four PDs going over my air check, not just one. 
[02:30:30]  That's true.  So I get a difference.  You should be the Piss Kid.  Right.  Urine God.  Dennis Valcombe.  He's talking about how you take loads of urine on your face.  You were in the 70s.  Ah, that would be good.  Who knew that Dennis liked to get pissed now?  A little piss.  Not only does he try.  How much every time I come in here.  Not only does he blow himself, he likes a good load of warm piss on his chest.  I would like to put an end to that nonsense.  How about Yellow Beaver Dennis Valcombe?  You do that?  What's that?  You blow yourself?  No.  Yes, he does.  He just doesn't like talking about it.  Hey, you know, I was trying to do that. 
[02:31:00]  I hurt your back.  I don't do it.  He doesn't work blue.  He had his bottom rib removed.  You know, I was doing a gig last week.  He's not going to mention it on the air, but he loves blowing himself.  And I'll tie that in.  You blow yourself at a bachelor party.  And I was up on stage.  Do you make sure your ass is clean so you don't smell your own ass as you're blowing yourself?  I was up on stage rocking the mic and rocking the house at the same time.  In Howard Beach.  Yeah.  And a guy walked by.  How do you clean your ass all night so you don't smell your own ass when you're blowing  yourself?  And a guy walked by and he just whited me and mouthed Denny.  I don't know.  I said, wow.  So then afterwards, I went down to the buffet, which was opened.  Of course. 
[02:31:30]  I'm sure it was free.  Did they ask why you're carrying a garbage bag and funneling food into it?  I always make sure the guests eat first, and then I don't go up until the host asks me,  hey, make sure you get something.  Oh, God.  Is it hard for you to ask food when you're on cocks in your mouth?  So a guy came by and he goes, hey, I'm already fed.  Thank you.  I got my fill of protein this morning.  I don't need any more.  Hey, Daddy, you hungry?  All right.  Maybe I'll take a cookie because I got my protein.  So he said, I listen to you on the Opie and Anthony show, and I love what you do with 
[02:32:00]  the guys and how they abuse you.  And I said, they're the nicest guys in the world.  Have you ever ejaculated into your eye when you're blowing yourself?  Or do you just like...  Yeah, it just pops out of the cheek and goes right loud.  Do you swallow your own cum?  And he goes, I really know that you don't do any of that disgusting stuff.  What do you think?  Do you think he swallows his own cum when he's blowing himself?  I don't think so.  Absolutely.  The guy will say, hey, do you want some food?  And he'll go...  That's the weirdest part about blowing yourself, I think, Danny, that you swallow your own  cum.  Yeah.  Well, then he feels guilty about it, so he takes a nice hot piss all over himself. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, man.  He can teach himself the lesson.  Really?  Did he ever come on the floor and then just lap it up like a puppy?  Hey, what are you guys doing for Burt Bacharach's birthday?  Are you playing any of the stuff from the Burt Bacharach David's songbook?  We don't know what the Burt Bacharach is.  What's the Burt Bacharach?  Burt Bacharach there, I just noticed on the prep sheet.  What's his biggest hits?  Well, he's got so many with Dionne Warwick.  He's 86.  He's the vocal piece for all those songs.  Dionne Warwick.  Is she still alive?  That's what my friends are for?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is she still alive?  I forgot.  Yeah.  That's what my friends are for.  Do you know the way to San Jose?  No, but if you could hum a few bars. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, God.  You did not just do that.  Menacing right there.  Give yourself a hummer.  That's one thing.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Do you know the way to San Jose?  I do not like Dionne Warwick.  What is this?  Face bugs me.  Is this Dionne Warwick?  Yeah.  I don't know what version this is.  Burt Bacharach, do you know the way to San Jose?  No, it's a dumb song.  Give me the hit before I split.  Let's play that one.  All right.  I want you to take us to break with some Burt Bacharach.  Actually, give me the hit before I suck myself off. 
[02:33:30]  Do you know the way to San Jose?  It's a quick one.  Dionne Warwick.  Yeah, exactly.  Who have you been, Travis?  Sorry, I didn't know the Dionne Warwick song.  Do you bob your head up and down or do you pump your hips into your mouth?  Oh, God.  It's a fair question.  It really is a fair question.  Do you bob or do you keep your head steady with your hands and then just kind of shimmy  your hips up?  Is it a strong pelvis or neck?  Do you have to push your head forward, both hands, just to get in there?  Yeah, just to get in there and just suck it to the root.  You're just short until you fucking put the hands behind your head and give that last 
[02:34:00]  thrust forward.  Hey, you want some food over at the buffet?  No?  Anything, Trev?  Hang on, I'm ready.  Oh, okay.  All right, talk this up and get the fuck out of here.  Happy 86th birthday.  Burt Bacharach and Hal David, one of the great songs of many that he wrote.  And Dionne Warwick took care of lots of great vocals like this one.  Let's sing along with Do You Know the Way to San Jose here on the Sirius XM Opie and  Anthony Show on a Monday morning.  Oh! 
[02:34:30]  You fucked up, Ray.  I did.  You chizzed on yourself.  Well, you know what?  You chizzed on yourself.  Can we hear about that a second ago?  A baseball player goes up there and if he gets a hit three out of ten times.  Yeah, but you threw the bat and hit the pitcher with it.  That was way off.  But you didn't even know how to cover it up.  Dan Ingram would have covered that up nicely.  He would have just kept talking.  That's right.  Excuse me, Dionne.  Yeah, go ahead.  What do you want to hear, Jimmy?  Just hear that again, how he butchered that.  Let's sing along with Do You Know the Way to San Jose here on the Sirius XM Opie and  Anthony Show on a Monday morning. 
[02:35:00]  Oh!  I stepped on it.  You had it.  I stepped on it.  Oh, that's not you.  Sorry.  I thought I was here for a second.  A big fail!  Is that your technique when you're blowing your...  No, I would think you'd have to be all the way on your back.  Hey, if you guys keep this up, I'm not coming in here anymore.  Whoa!  These guys holding a shaft.  It's a threat.  And licking.  Oh, yeah.  This is the dentist.  Is that your technique right there?  Throw those hips back and your ab bunches up a little bit.  Let's put it into this right now.  All right.  Let's see you do it.  Right now.  All right.  Is that you? 
[02:35:30]  Is that my dad?  Yeah.  It starts up feelings, doesn't it?  Feelings of...  Why would you even want to look at that?  That's the stress.  Oh, I'm just wondering where you...  We're trying to figure out your technique.  How did you learn to self-suck?  Yeah.  No.  Oh, there you go.  That's why that mech house was backwards, so he didn't poke himself in the fucking thighs  with it.  Wow, that guy's got like a big thing up his ass, and he's tucking himself off.  Yeah, does that help motivate you to put something in your hiney?  Is it okay if I cross-promote something here?  I'll be doing the after show today.  Some people can just lick the tip, and others can really get a good mouthful. 
[02:36:00]  I hate when they just bird lick the tip.  I like when they get down there.  Am I right or wrong?  You're doing the post show today?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I've been there.  Sam will be on assignment.  On assignment.  I'm in for Sam Roberts, who's on assignment.  What are you doing?  Interviewing Chris Jericho.  Didn't we just...  Yeah, we already liked it.  But I thought we...  Through the magic of...  He will do a complete wrestling interview.  Star chambers.  Oh, yeah.  Why don't you just take the cuts, cut up what they said, and just place your voice in there?  That's a good point.  They could tape it in advance and just... 
[02:36:30]  Great idea.  It's done.  It's an awesome idea.  Just replace your questions with my voice.  Yes.  Keep our reactions in there, though.  Okay, yeah, that would make sense.  All right, Denny, we learned a lot today.  Thank you very much, boys.  Always a pleasure.  All right, Denny Falcone.  I was on, now I'm gone.  The warm pee thing, that's crazy.  Yeah, that you piss on yourself.  Exactly.  That's weird.  This guy worked with Dan Ingram and now it's...  Dan Ingram.  He has to combat rumors that he performs fellatio on himself. 
[02:37:00]  Blows himself.  And now pisses all over himself.  Pan flute.  Poor Denny.  Exactly.  All right, so a good-natured guy.  Oh, we have one more apology left for today after the break.  Oh, man.  I forgot about that.  We had five apologies today as we try to go a lousy ten days on the Opie and Anthony show  without an apology.  And we're not even reaching for this at all.  We have five today.  Five apologies. 
[02:37:30]  We'll do the last one next.  Stay there.  We'll do the last one next time. 
[02:38:00]  Space Hog.  Yeah.  Space Hog.  Space Hog.  All right.  On the Opie station that really rocks.  Oh, yeah.  Brings back memories of finger popping this slob.  We should do 70s Day.  Oh, yeah.  I could talk up some songs with some stories from the past as well.  Oh, yeah.  I think we should do that.  70s.  I did give up on the music show. 
[02:38:30]  I did want to do a little something here and there.  Yeah.  But just mix all the crap together.  That's all you got to do.  Because rock fans listen to, like, you know, some wimpy stuff or whatever, like a fucking  70s song or whatever.  So I figured, just mix it all up.  No, everything's got to be very compartmentalized here.  When they handed me that playlist, I'm like, oh, okay.  All right.  Okay.  I'm not going to do this.  Thanks, but no thanks.  What?  But you can pick any song on the list and we don't even care if you, like, play an Alice  in Chains song and then play a Pearl Jam song right after that. 
[02:39:00]  Oh, wow.  Because that's something we wouldn't do because there's similar styles of, you know, grunge  and stuff.  So we would actually mix it up there.  But if you want to do that, that's okay by us.  Right.  No, thank you.  Like, oh, like I would throw, I don't know, Alice in Chains into a Johnny Cash.  I was trying to think of something, you know, when I was discussing that.  Right.  Just something completely different that you don't really hear.  Ugh.  But you can't play Johnny Cash because it's not on the list of songs.  But it's like 20 pages. 
[02:39:30]  Look, there's a lot of good choices here.  Look at all the songs.  So you want me to be like every other jock on Alt-Rock or whatever the fuck, whatever  channel it was going to be?  Was it Octane?  No, it wasn't even Octane.  I'm like, forget it.  Alt-Nation?  Oh, I mean Alt-Nation, right.  Alt-Rock.  Yeah, Alt-Nation.  I was like, forget it.  Good call, Trav.  Whatever.  I, uh, I, I, oh, boy, do I, I gotta say hi to everybody that came out over the weekend.  Oh, my God, Saturday at the Village Idiot in Patchogue. 
[02:40:00]  It was packed.  The gig was good, huh?  Fucking packed.  It was really good.  Some, some fucking blonde chick, she goes, could we take a picture with you grabbing  my tit?  And I'm like, sure.  Big fucking round tit.  Where are these pictures?  I don't know.  She took it.  So I took the picture and grabbed her, her tit.  That's nice.  That's nice for people to see.  And then she comes back though later and goes, it was blurry.  Could we do it again?  I'm like, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  You weren't offended? 
[02:40:30]  No.  I thought it was grand.  And then there's, uh, the other picture of Donnie, uh, that, yeah, that's in Central  Islip.  That's a black kid.  It's my sister Dawn and she's hanging out with, no, I put, uh, I put, uh, my, the Moors,  I said, the Moors, they did, uh, so much fucking with the Sicilian women, but I was asking  her what that was.  And, uh, I hashtagged, um, Donald Sterling, but you remember the kid you had to, I remember 
[02:41:00]  that kid.  Okay.  That was Zareen's little brother.  Her name was Zareen.  Zareen.  Zareen.  We used to sing a little, uh, song.  It was like, Jesus loves the little children of the world except Zareen.  That's nice.  Cause Jesus didn't love Zareen.  Why?  Which one?  Well, I don't know.  Didn't love her.  They put all the black families in one apartment building.  It was the garden apartments on Hawthorne Avenue in, uh, Central Islip. 
[02:41:30]  And it was all like the white people, white people, white people.  And then one building was where they put all the black families and it never quite got  all the real attention that it was supposed to get.  It's a little more broken down.  Right.  Yeah.  Is that it?  That's where you used to live.  Did we do this?  That doesn't look like.  I feel like we did this.  Hawthorne Avenue.  There was a, there were a couple of apartments across the street, but it was, um.  Okay, you got a nice pool.  I think it's there on the right.  Look at the nice pool you got.  Middle on the right, right there. 
[02:42:00]  Did you have that nice pool?  Yeah, they put a big facade up that we didn't used to be there, but no, we didn't have the  pool.  No.  Not then.  Yeah.  That looks like a pretty good place.  It was great.  We had a Vietnam vet living family, living next door to us.  Mm-hmm.  And the woman would always say, uh, you know, you gotta be a man.  My brother's like, how's your boy doing in Vietnam?  She goes, he's not a boy.  You gotta be a man to fight and kill.  Jesus.  And we were like kids.  It was like, ah, it's scary.  She was all in, huh? 
[02:42:30]  He was so all in.  And then he came back from Vietnam one day and, uh, and everybody was celebrating.  There were balloons up and everything.  And he just walked in with the fucking thousand yard stare.  He was a nice guy too.  Like, oh, he said hi to all the families and everything.  And then when he came back for this homecoming thing, he just kind of walked in like Frankenstein  with just that thousand yard stare.  Wonder years?  Uh, it's almost like wonder years.  Yeah.  Oh, you were like doing a science show.  No, no, this was real.  Now you're doing wonder years?  This is fucking wonder years, Anthony version. 
[02:43:00]  How old, how old, Sal, can you show me?  Is it the one on the far right hand with the red door?  Yeah.  How old is that place?  It doesn't look that old.  It doesn't now.  I guess they made it up or something.  They, they made it up.  Uh, oh, no, it's Joe.  What does Joe want?  I think Joe probably remembers some of this.  Yes.  Uh, brother Joe.  Hey, I just, I just drove past there a couple of days ago.  Yeah.  I actually went up to a ride with Carol on the bike and I said, uh, this is where I used  to live.  And, uh, you know, of course, uh, CI back then was a little different than it is. 
[02:43:30]  Well, how much different though?  Because I mean, as far as, as far as like, you know, ethnic, uh, percentages, yeah, way  more diversified now than it was back then.  Than it was.  I just remember like CI was even known back then for having a lot of, uh, black people  and, uh, Hispanics and, uh, it was one of the higher crime areas.  And, uh, the difference back then is they were more angry. 
[02:44:00]  It was, it was like right around the, uh, you know, like militant, it was, it was more  militant black back then than, uh, you know, than it is now.  Right now it's all about political correctness and blah, blah, blah.  But as far as, as far as people being pissed off.  Yeah.  I mean, I used to, I used to get into a fight a day back then because it was, it was always  the black kids love beating up the white kids.  Give me 50 cents.  Give me 50 cents.  I remember.  Give me 50 cents.  Give me 50 cents.  For an apple, for an apple in the apple machine that would shake down the white kids. 
[02:44:30]  And most of them would fess up with the 50 cents and I would kick one in the kneecap.  It was just, uh, it would, I would never, uh, you know, never, uh, cause dad would give  us that advice.  If a black kid ever wants to fight you, kick them in the kneecaps.  They got weak knees.  Oh, he said that.  He goes, don't hit them in the head.  They're too hard.  Hit them in the kneecaps.  You know how many times he said, if I didn't, if I didn't fight back the black kid, I would  get my ass kicked by him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to fight back.  That was his other big thing, yeah. 
[02:45:00]  And he didn't say black kid, by the way.  Yeah.  You know, dad was good for dropping in bombs.  Didn't you hear him say that?  Oh, yeah.  Well, we first moved there.  I remember when, uh, you know, when the old man and the old lady split up and we had to  move into more affordable housing.  We, um, I remember him saying, uh, saying to us, you're moving to Central Islip, where,  where the ends are, where all of the ends are.  We're all the, yeah, that's what he said.  I remember hearing him say that to, to, to the old lady. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Why would he say, oh, Joey?  Why would he say ends?  He didn't say the word?  Oh, boy, did he ever.  No, he said, he said, so you're moving to where the niggers are.  Oh, Joey, Jesus Christ.  Everyone's the same.  They're all just people.  And then a few years later, my mother's like, ah, these niggers.  Jesus.  It didn't matter.  It didn't matter.  And it wasn't just, uh, like, you know, I just seemed like everyone was pissed off in  that area around that time.  Yeah, it was the fucking early 70s. 
[02:46:00]  Right.  The kids from across the street, uh, lived in a, it was Concord Village Apartments.  We were in Plymouth Village Apartments.  Oh, right.  And there were, like, there were gangs, there were, like, gang fights.  I mean, we were kids, we were, like, eight, nine, ten years old, beating the shit out  of each other in these, uh, you know, with, like, one apartment building versus another.  Oh, yeah.  Just a, uh, a hell of a way to grow up.  This will be in the book, by the way.  Yes, need the book.  Need to write the book.  I'm in the midst of penning. 
[02:46:30]  You just don't know it yet.  I'm definitely writing a book.  And this will be part of it.  So I drove through there, as I was saying, had Carol on the bike.  We went and took a cruise through, uh, Central Island, all up around, like, Pedretti's house.  Remember where, uh, and, uh, and the, uh, and the stores, like, you know, downtown, where  I got caught shoplifting many, many times.  Sure.  We, um, you know, drove all through there.  And it's a little more ethnically diverse. 
[02:47:00]  Like, I saw way more, uh, a much higher percentage of white and Hispanic.  Yeah, believe it or not, white and Hispanic.  I think they're kind of, like, they're trying to, uh, you know, give it a remake, the way  they did, like, down in Patchogue and stuff.  Um, and it looks like it's, uh, it's changing a little bit.  Good luck.  Good luck, CI.  Yeah, that's what I say.  I won't be there anytime soon.  No.  Unless I'm driving through on the bike.  No.  All right.  All right, Joe.  Thanks, brother Joe.  I don't care that your voice sounded incredibly, really, really good. 
[02:47:30]  That was a pisser.  I work with pros.  I work with pros all the time.  Damn.  Singing-wise, you sounded really good.  Yeah, that was, uh, that was a blast.  We got to do that again.  It was a lot of fucking people, a lot of fans.  That was a pisser.  Pisser.  All right, man.  Bye, man.  Bye, Joe.  Label.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah.  I just, uh.  I know, I felt on Saturday.  I felt on, man.  Sometimes you hit that stage.  You hit that stage and you're like, I'm on.  I actually say that.  Do you?  Yes.  I walk right on just to confirm for the audience that they are indeed seeing me. 
[02:48:00]  You're seeing me and I'm wonderful.  I'm on.  I, uh, I just clicked on CNN.  The story is, uh, NFL draft reactions heat up after Michael Sam kissed his boyfriend on  TV.  You bet they heat up.  Yeah.  And, uh, Stuart, uh, Stuart Scott from ESPN tweeted, uh, NFL guys get drafted, kiss girlfriends.  Michael Sam kissed his boyfriend.  Don't like.  That's a you problem. 
[02:48:30]  Ew.  Congrats, Mike.  Even though he's right, do you have to say it like a fucking 13-year-old girl?  That's a you problem.  That's how 13-year-old girls say things.  Yeah.  I know, because I date them.  Ah.  They say that to me.  We talked about it earlier though, man.  I mean, we're not used to that.  So yeah, you're going to get a kind of a, it doesn't mean you're not tolerant as far  as, you know, the gay issue goes.  It still looks incredibly awkward.  I think if you're doing anything to foster hatred or, or abuse, um, violence against gay 
[02:49:00]  people, that's ridiculous.  Right.  Uh, it shouldn't happen.  But if you're looking at a situation like that and you're a guy and, and you say that  nothing about that is shocking or, or makes you take a step back or like, whoa, you got,  then you're just being dishonest.  You're just lying.  And that's a you problem.  Right.  You're being completely dishonest.  You're being dishonest with yourself.  With yourself and everyone else around you.  Exactly.  You're lying to make yourself seem so much better, uh, than everyone else because you 
[02:49:30]  didn't even give it a second glance or thought when you saw a giant football player kissing  his little waif-like white boyfriend.  You didn't look and go, whoa, I really gotta, this isn't processing properly.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Doesn't mean you're a hater or anything.  That's like, you're seeing something unusual.  Why is that always akin to, uh, uh, violence and hate speech and this, that it's not, it's 
[02:50:00]  a human reaction to seeing something you're not used to seeing something new, something  different.  And, and you, you have a reaction to that.  Why is that reaction?  Why does it have to be a bad thing?  It's just a thing.  You know, the cake in the mouth.  The kiss didn't really bother me.  I like the cake in the mouth, right?  The cake in the mouth was too playful.  I didn't like it.  You didn't like how playful it was?  I, I don't like when heterosexual couples do that.  Right, right.  I don't.  When they get married, look, he's putting cake, they're gonna feed it nice, they fucking  hate that.  Did you hear the nickname he's got for his boyfriend? 
[02:50:30]  Shmoopy.  Calls him Shmoopy.  No, he doesn't.  Oh, Shmoopy.  I don't believe you.  Hey, Shmoopy.  That's Seinfeld.  They do.  What?  That's Seinfeld.  You, you watch Seinfeld and see if it's there.  Is it?  Of course it is.  All right, good.  Yeah, save us the time.  Jeez.  I don't know.  Even when hetero couples kiss a little too heavily.  I don't mind that.  Just the cake bothers me.  The cake bothers me.  I mean, a good, I mean, I'll watch a lesbian kiss all day long.  All day long.  Heterosexual.  Even that's a little, like, all right.  Yeah.  The public, especially in public. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  It's like, all right.  Uh-huh.  So, I don't know.  People do.  There's just people lying.  There's people just lying all over the place about this.  Eyes closed.  Look at this kiss.  Eyes closed.  The head turned.  The cake is smeared all over their face.  Dude, you just gotta, like.  Sal, put your cock back and stop jacking it like that.  That's terrible.  He's jerking off to the gay kissing pick. 
[02:51:30]  Wow.  You think some of the old school football players gave kisses like this?  No.  Well, they were drafted?  No matter what they were kissing?  I would love to know what is said in private amongst some of the other guy players that are heterosexual.  Oh, my God.  It would be the greatest thing to hear ever.  It's probably this.  Jesus Christ.  And the fact that it's like a little white guy. 
[02:52:00]  It just, that whole thing, too.  See, you wonder who's like, you know, people always wonder who's the dominant one in the sexual relationship.  Oh, boy.  But when you put that cake in that little guy's mouth, you're like, oh, yeah, it works out the way it should.  Yeah, that's.  That's the way it should work out.  They went to college together.  He was on the swim team.  Oh.  Oh.  Was he?  Little wafy.  Yeah, he's got the swimmer spot.  Whatever.  But to make believe that it didn't make you, like, react at all as you would be.  Oh, boy.  That's telling right there.  That one? 
[02:52:30]  Oh, boy.  Yeah?  Oh.  Wasn't there rumors of mysteriousness?  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, right?  Oh, yeah, his wife.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I wonder.  A little mystery.  Mystery date.  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Hey, hey, hey.  Well, anyway.  So, Stuart Scott.  He does tell it like it is, this Stuart Scott. 
[02:53:00]  Watch out for him.  Watch out for Mr. Scott.  Yeah, that's a you problem.  Right.  E-W-E.  Yeah.  Sheep joke.  Yeah.  It's not a you problem if you're just, you know.  No.  Talking about it and assessing it.  Yeah.  If you're not used to something, you're going to react accordingly.  Like, whoa, okay, I see.  I see what's happening here.  And some people will react with some, you know, this visceral disgust or.  There, there, it doesn't even have to be a disgust that, that deeply. 
[02:53:30]  Like, oh, it's two, two people that are in love.  Oh, I'm disgusted with that.  No.  But can't there be some visceral human reaction to something that is so taboo to a heterosexual male?  Well, that's what it is, too.  It's like, you can't look at that and then picture yourself in that scene.  It's like, it's so not, it's so, it's, it's, I'll say repulsive.  I'm just going to fucking say, I'm not going to look for another word. 
[02:54:00]  When heterosexual men look at two men being that intimate with each other, there's a repulsion.  There's a repulsion as a heterosexual male to that because you, there's no, there's no empathy there.  You can't, you can't put yourself in that situation without feeling very uncomfortable.  But if you talk about it, that's a great picture.  If you talk about it, honestly, you're a fucking, you know, a homophobe. 
[02:54:30]  I don't know how that works.  Do we really believe we can reprogram each other?  No.  Reprogram human emotions?  I think people think they can, yeah.  There's no way that's going to happen.  There's instinctual things that, that are just in us.  There's emotion.  I think you could teach, you know, tolerance.  Tolerance.  But tolerance, people forget that tolerance means to tolerate something.  It doesn't mean to agree with it or accept it or make it your own.  You're tolerating it. 
[02:55:00]  But to reprogram people not to, like, have a reaction to that, right, to that kiss is, that's crazy.  When two men are making out with cake on their face on TV, there's going to be some people looking going,  eesh, wow, holy fuck.  Oh, what's the matter?  You want to beat them up and something?  No.  Not at all, but, wow, that's a little rough to just have thrown right at me.  Not to mention the message it sends about cake and sugar.  Exactly.  Guy who gets it totally wrong. 
[02:55:30]  Totally misses the point.  Yeah, guy who throws something at his stuff.  No, it's not a healthy diet.  But everybody agrees with him just to shut him up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's about the cake.  I'll probably eat better.  Well, it'll be very interesting to see how he does with the Rams.  Being a seventh, you know, round draft pick.  Indeed he do.  You know, a lot of attention because he's openly gay.  I wonder if the gay players in the league are fucking pissed off by this.  That swimmer's in damn good shape, though. 
[02:56:00]  That guy's got some good.  I wish I had abs like that.  He is in good shape.  You've got to think there's at least a couple on each team, right?  A couple of gay guys on each team?  I don't know what the ratio is.  At least one, maybe more.  I mean, one out of three.  How many players?  40 on a team?  There's got to be close to 40 on a roster, right?  Who knows better than, what's the number?  Travis.  We've got to be quite a few.  I'm not totally sure.  I know it's 40 in baseball.  Perhaps more than 53 people.  Out of 53 people per team, there's got to be a couple on each team. 
[02:56:30]  There has to be.  Got him.  Bill Burr does a not-ready-foreseen-gay-kissing bit.  Oh, does he?  Where can we find this Bill Burr bit there, Vince?  I heard it on Raw Dog Comedy Radio.  Could you find that for us?  I do like a good Bill Burr.  It's a great bit how he says that he was a kid, he saw a girl and a guy for the first time in porn,  and his dick got hard, and it was natural, and that was his natural reaction. 
[02:57:00]  Well, don't do the bit.  Hold on, we might have-  Exactly, so you're swirling it.  We might have found the bit.  You're no Bill Burr, sir.  I've worked at Bill Burr.  I've seen Bill Burr sitting here, and you're no Bill Burr.  Absolutely.  I've kissed Bill Burr with cake in my mouth.  I was on call for, sir.  And you are no Bill Burr, sir.  Yes.  Have a good day.  You, sir.  Okay.  What's the matter?  Condoms.  And bang away.  No.  If you find the bit that they play in Raw Dog.  Gay kiss thing?  No? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, but that's a hard copy of it, too.  Oh, Sal.  If you find it, the one they play in Raw Dog, that'd be great.  Come on.  Our final apology today.  We had five today.  This is craziness.  Five apologies today.  We're trying to go ten days without an apology.  Right.  Any new apologies come in since we started the radio show?  Really?  I bet you there could be.  I bet.  I bet you there might be a new one.  Or at least the situation has presented itself that we'll need an apology by tomorrow.  Jack, how do you say U-P-P-A-L? 
[02:58:00]  U-P-A-L?  U-P-A-L?  U-P-A-L?  I don't know.  U-P-A-L?  U-P-A-L?  U-P-A-L?  U-P-A-L?  U-P-A-L?  U-P-A-L?  Jack Up Pal.  Jack Up Pal.  That's his name.  Oh, that's probably it.  It's not playing, though.  Jack Up Pal, liberal candidate, apologizes for a controversial Facebook post.  So...  Uh-oh.  Is this Cananida?  Cananida?  Is it Cananida?  Yes.  Cananida-dian?  Jack Up Pal's campaign is not off to a good start. 
[02:58:30]  The new liberal candidate for the provincial riding of blah, blah, blah, apologized Saturday  after a now-deleted post on his Facebook wall claiming to be an analysis of men's and women's  brains made the rounds online.  Women can easily learn many languages but cannot find solutions to problems.  One part of the status read.  Men's brains has a lot of space for handling the analytical process.  They can analyze and find the solution for a process and design a map of a building easily. 
[02:59:00]  But if a complex map is viewed by women, they cannot understand it.  Women cannot understand the details of a map easily.  Because they're stupid.  For them, it is just a dump of lines on a paper.  Well, I mean, women are horrible at directions.  Well, yeah.  It's been said our entire lives.  It's true.  You tell them to slow down, your fucking teeth is hitting it.  He fucking speeds up.  Types of directions.  Oh, I'm squeezing my balls that hard.  It hurts.  I'm going to tug my bag.  That's...  Yeah, what the hell is it? 
[02:59:30]  It is upsetting that Kathleen Wine would appoint a candidate who would spread such sexist,  closed-minded views.  The statement reads,  A pal apologizing in a statement released by the liberals saying that he didn't intend for the post to be taken literally.  Well, how else?  I'm right.  Ah, people are so stupid.  So, we just threw that apology on the end there.  Yeah.  We did get five today.  Five apologies.  Wow. 
[03:00:00]  I don't even know why he had to apologize for that.  Exactly.  I thought the women understood what he meant.  Right.  Tell me it was a recipe.  Tell the girls it was a recipe.  Tell the gal.  It was a recipe, toots.  Right.  How to make fresh cookies.  Toots.  Get in there.  Put on that apron.  Make me a fresh cookie.  Girls did not want to be called toots in this day and age.  No, neither do waitresses when we would be out and can't eat when I was dealing with dice.  Oh, really?  Excuse me, toots!  He would do that in the fucking Venetian.  Toots.  To make us laugh.  Would the women get mad? 
[03:00:30]  The whole restaurant heard him.  Excuse me, toots!  Can I get some ketchup?  Excuse me, toots.  That's so degrading.  That was mortifying.  Devin.  Yellow.  Oh, do we know Devin?  No.  I feel like we've talked to you before.  All right.  What do you got?  I just want to say, like, all my friends that happen to be gay, when they see straight people  kiss, they think it's disgusting. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, yeah.  But do you understand that's completely acceptable?  Yeah.  But if a straight guy has a problem with two men kissing, then all of a sudden you need  to learn tolerance and learn to be more accepting.  Well, I think it's one thing to think it's gross, but it's another thing to, like, go on Twitter  or whatever and, like, talk about how it's gross.  Well, you should be able to give your opinion, but Twitter's a shitty place.  That's the place you should be able to do it.  I just mean...  Twitter is a really shitty place. 
[03:01:30]  Huh?  I'm just saying it's more than you just thinking it's gross.  And if you feel the need to, like, go out and talk about it, that's more than just you.  Why shouldn't you be able to say what your view is, like, if it's positive or negative,  if it's pleasing or gross?  Why shouldn't you be able to express each opinion?  I mean, I'm not saying you should say, hey, that guy should get hit with a hammer.  But if you find it unpleasant, why can't you say that?  Right.  As a human being, why can't you, like, you know, express yourself?  I think you can say it.  You can say it.  You should be able to say it. 
[03:02:00]  But we have to be honest and say it's more than just you at that point.  It's a pretty strong feeling.  Boy, it's okay.  So how about people that are saying it's good and positive?  Then it's a strong feeling, too.  Okay.  I mean, it's fine to say it.  I just think it's more than just, like, a passing thought of, like, you, if you go online and talk about it.  But should I be offended that gay guys don't like to see, you know, straight people kissing?  No.  Of course not.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  So they shouldn't give a fuck that we find it weird that they're... 
[03:02:30]  You know, they're kissing.  Exactly.  It's a little weird.  It's still a little weird.  There are...  No, there are...  No, there are gay people, and especially gay activists and some political, politically correct celebrities and everything,  that honestly believe that everybody should look at that kiss as a wonderful, beautiful thing.  And the second it pops on, you should be, like, you should be tilting your head and going,  Oh, that's so, so wonderful.  What a great moment.  And then that, if you look at it and go, like, Oh, whoa, wait a minute. 
[03:03:00]  That you are just as bad as somebody that would take a crowbar and start cracking gay people over the head because they're gay.  There's no, you know, there's no gray area in there with a lot of these gay activists.  I feel like most of my friends, they don't give a fuck what you think.  They just want to be left alone.  No shit.  So if you don't like them, they don't care.  Gay sex.  Just don't fucking bother me with it.  Yeah.  What are you...  You got a lot of gay friends?  You know what they call that, right? 
[03:03:30]  What?  A woman that has a lot of gay friends.  Uh, no.  It used to be called a fag hag.  Oh.  But now it's so politically incorrect to say the, the F word.  Right.  And, uh...  And they're just called fat.  Yeah, now they're just called fat.  Oh, is that the truth?  She's not denying it, by the way.  If you were a girl, would you be right on that? 
[03:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  No?  I'm what?  What are they, fun to hang out with and drink wine with and go shopping with?  Well, I'm sober, but...  Oh.  Um, I just live in Boston.  That's a you problem.  Yeah, that is a me problem.  You, you people in Boston like to segregate everybody, so...  Yeah.  What do you mean?  What do you mean?  Well, we've talked about this.  Southie, North End, fucking...  Dorchester.  Dorchester. 
[03:04:30]  Roxbury.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'm not from here.  I just moved.  The Jews keep...  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking...  Where was, uh...  Brucey?  That was where the Jews lived.  Oh, where the hell are we?  Oh, uh...  Newton.  Newton.  Yeah.  Newton, they called it.  Yeah.  They did call it Newton when we were up there.  And Boston's like, yeah, we like to keep all our fucking ethnics all rounded up in a proper  place.  So we know where they are.  Yeah, we know where they are.  At all times.  Don't come down Route 9. 
[03:05:00]  They're a bit...  Southie.  If you're a bit on the dark side, don't come down Route 9 through Newton.  They're all in Roxbury now.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'm learning it all still.  Yeah, Boston's really divvied it up.  Right.  Not as bad as Chicago.  Right.  Well, Chicago's a whole other nightmare.  Another 22, was it?  22 shot over the weekend.  In Chicago?  Five, four, five dead. 
[03:05:30]  Man.  Yeah, it was a lot of shootings.  I watched the Vice documentary.  It was good.  Yeah, it was really good.  The Vice documentary?  The one that we were talking about.  The school.  The school.  The one about the last chance high.  Last chance high.  Oh, maybe you left already.  Last chance high.  It's about a...  It's like emotionally disturbed.  They're all emotionally disturbed kids, though.  It's on Vice?  Yeah.  Where?  On their website?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  It's pretty good.  Do you feel bad for those kids, though?  Like when the kid went to visit his father in prison? 
[03:06:00]  You're like, oh.  It was just sad.  Yeah, it was kind of sad.  I just want a normal...  I just want a good family.  So then, you know, because he wants a good family, he'll just go to school and punch other  people.  Yeah, but it's like, this is just a shit life.  It is.  It's a shit life.  And did you notice, though, that the shit life starts with the shit family?  Yeah.  Like, their father's in prison.  The mother can't fucking deal with anything.  And she's got an arm full of fucking new kids.  Yeah.  The brother's shot and killed.  It's just one of those... 
[03:06:30]  Was it good, though?  Yeah.  It was good.  I gotta check that out.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, Devin, thank you.  Yep.  You're wonderful.  We appreciate you.  Great, Devin.  All right.  All right.  Rotund Devin.  All right.  Did we find the Bill Burr bit?  I found it.  Let me hear this.  Nice.  All right.  This is basically what happened, okay?  She tried to say I was homophobic.  I think she's full of shit.  And this is the story.  All right?  We were in a diner, right?  We just got done eating, okay?  It came out.  I was looking down at the ground. 
[03:07:00]  And when I looked up, there was like these two dudes, like hardcore making out, you know?  And it's like, I wasn't fucking ready.  You know what I mean?  It was all it was.  I wasn't ready.  It's like, you know, if you're in a Brokeback Mountain or I'm walking through the village,  I can get my brain prepared for what I might see.  But it's like, I wasn't fucking ready.  You know, I'm just eating these fries.  I'm like, ah, you dumb shit.  You got to go to the gym.  You know, it's in my own head.  And when I looked up, these two dudes, one guy had a beard.  He's going at it.  So the second I looked up, I just went like, uh, I just looked away. 
[03:07:30]  That's all I did real quick.  I just, and then this girl was just glaring at me like, oh my God, what's that all about?  What's that?  Were you like, homophobic?  Are you homophobic?  I'm like, no, I'm not homophobic.  I got no hatred.  You know, I got no hatred in that area.  She goes, what was that all about?  I go, I was, it was just like a visual thing.  It was just, you know, she goes, what are you talking about?  I go, put it this way.  The first time I ever saw a porno, I was like 14 years old.  I had no idea what doggy style was, but the second I saw it, my brain was just like, that 
[03:08:00]  is the shit.  I want to fucking do that.  I want to convince a woman to do that with me.  Right?  My brain was like, yes, my dick was up.  Everything was in agreement.  That this was a wonderful thing, and I had no idea what it was.  But the same token, if at any point during that porno, if somebody started like kissing  somebody's feet, or like sucking on their toes, it was just, it was just gross to me.  But that doesn't mean I hate feet, and I don't want them in my neighborhood. 
[03:08:30]  That just means I'm not into that shit.  It's the same thing with the gay dudes.  I have no hatred in my heart for gay people, all right?  They're cool, they're funny, generally speaking, they're neat, you know?  I've got a lot of positive things to say about them, you know?  They move to your neighborhood, the property value goes up, because they make it fabulous,  right?  They can't reproduce, so they're not making more in-the-way people walking around, looking  up at shit.  Yeah.  They're wonderful for the environment, God bless them. 
[03:09:00]  But how far does political correctness go, that I've got to look at some shit that's  making my brain go like, ah, fucking look away, right?  I'm supposed to override that, start, like, cheering on the relationship, like, woo, grab  your desk!  Yeah, bring your fingers through his chest hair!  Dude, it's ridiculous.  You're going to tell me some gay guy who never walked down the street, seen two straight  people just going at it, and never just thought, like, oh, God, why would you?  I just, like, walk it off. 
[03:09:30]  He can't help it, that's just how his brain is wired, right?  He's just, like, pussy, and I'm, like, dick, right?  But there's no hatred in that.  Right on the money, that's exactly what you're talking about.  I can't help, I just couldn't fucking explain it to this girl.  She's like, yeah, I'm public, it's like, no, I was on the same level, you ever see a  big guy eating a sandwich, right?  And he gets a little mustard on the side of his face, right?  You fucking look away.  But that doesn't mean you want him to choke on the sandwich, you want to get a bunch 
[03:10:00]  of friends to beat the shit out of him, break the sandwich, right?  Yeah, people mistake people.  Dude, whatever you put your mouth on is the most intimate thing.  That's, uh, that's, there's, there's honesty for you.  People mistake that for hatred and the want to commit violence against it.  It's not.  I don't even think they mistake it.  I just think that they don't like that you said something they don't like.  Right.  I think that they know that that's not necessarily...  Yeah, I think people have just gotten that sensitive and that irritating in people expressing 
[03:10:30]  a dissenting opinion or a different opinion that they will not tolerate any level of a  different opinion.  But I think they also see it as, you know, if they don't say, see direct violence in that,  they would say it fosters an environment of intolerance that leads to people.  But, uh...  I think that's the excuse they give.  So I have to, you know, shut off my human emotion and react, response, reaction. 
[03:11:00]  Fake response.  Yeah, yeah, fake.  And, uh, yeah, respond accordingly.  Would you suck a dick or kiss a man deeply on the lips if you had to choose one or the other?  Oh, jeez.  Which would you choose?  What do you mean, would I?  I think the kissing is, like, really infamous.  That kissing thing.  Because, yeah, but it's like Bill's bit.  It's like, if you're ready to see something, it's one thing.  So, you know, if there's a porno going on and some big dick gentleman is fucking, you know, 
[03:11:30]  getting his fucking rods sucked, it's not like, it's not like, uh, because you knew.  You knew.  It's fucking porno.  But if there's two guys just all of a sudden kissing, you're not ready for it.  You go, whoa.  Can you make believe it's an ice cream cone?  Oh.  That's what you're supposed to do.  Can you?  You should.  Hopefully with no sprinkles on it.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  Hi, who's this? 
[03:12:00]  Lady Di.  God.  Thank God we're going home.  Thank God we didn't take this call soon.  Oh, yeah.  Thank goodness.  Why?  I wanted to ask you guys something.  I guarantee that what you're about to ask us, and I really don't know, is going to be  complete nonsense.  Useless.  It has nothing to do with a talk radio show.  Useless nonsense.  Like we're talking about the Michael Sam thing and the Donald Sterling thing and the Charles  Barkley thing. 
[03:12:30]  I guarantee what you're about to ask us is complete and utter nonsense that has nothing  to do for a radio show.  Opie, this has something to do with the radio show.  Next month, you said something about a super show, right?  Okay.  Yeah.  It's going to be a black tie event?  Yes.  All right.  With a red carpet and everything?  Yes.  There will be a red carpet.  How are we supposed to dress for this show?  Black tie event is fancy.  As fancy as you can dress. 
[03:13:00]  How do you need to ask that question?  You need a gown.  All right.  All right.  Well, first of all, I don't think Marion is going because I just talked to her.  I don't think she's going to be there.  No, no, no.  No one cares.  Why?  No one cares.  What the fuck?  Marion's going.  All right.  All right.  Wait, wait, wait.  You asked the question and I answered you.  Is she too busy being a tough guy somewhere?  Yeah.  Look out.  Watch out.  Here comes Marion.  Put up your dukes.  Right.  She's working right now.  All right.  Now, I have dress pants and I have dress shirts. 
[03:13:30]  It's got to be a gown, we said.  A gown.  A gown.  You ever watch like the Oscars and you see what the celebrities wear?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, just see what Willie wore from Free Willie and go back a ways.  I don't have any gowns.  What?  A nude.  Hold on.  What?  Go nude.  Go nude.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, go and buy a gown.  Get yourself a gown.  Go. 
[03:14:00]  Where am I going to get a gown?  It's a gala event.  At the dollar store.  That's Family Dollar.  Right.  They'd probably have one in the back.  No, no, no.  Not a Family Dollar.  You don't get gowns at Family Dollar.  Oh, no shit, Sherlock.  Oh, no, no.  They don't have that.  No, no, no.  How many Natty Ices?  This is my, believe it or not, you're not going to believe it.  This is my fourth one.  Why wouldn't we believe it?  It's exactly the same as what you're talking about.  I would have guessed it would have been four, five, or six.  Right.  If I had a guess.  What difference does it make? 
[03:14:30]  It's only beer.  Right.  It's only beer at 10.30.  I'm not messed up or anything.  You're not.  You're just a pants-shitting embarrassment.  Four beers before 10.30.  What's what?  It's only beer.  It's only beer.  While everyone else is going to work or trying to get a job.  By the way, hi, Sam.  And hi, Jimmy.  They're not in here.  They're not in there right now.  Jimmy is.  I'm not right now.  Jimmy is there because I hear him.  Yes.  All right.  We've got to go.  Slurs McGillis.  Just for Labs Festival, I will be there giving the keynote address July 24th and doing a gig at the Gisu Theater the 26th at midnight. 
[03:15:00]  Very cool.  Saturday night.  Gisu everyone.  Ha ha ha dot com.  Yes.  Wait, wait, wait.  We've got to start talking about the Bobo bit.  Are we going to do this?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe after our little break.  I think we're taking a week.  What's the Bobo bit?  Jesus Christ.  It has nothing to do with you.  Jesus Christ.  He's still a friend of mine. 
[03:15:30]  Give us a fuck.  Who cares?  Oh, God.  Oh, my goodness.  What a drunk monster.  That's what I'll never understand.  How is she a fan of the show?  Do you want...  I was always a fan of your show.  Are you talking...  Are you talking about me?  No, we're talking about some other fucking ill-timed moose.  I was always a fan of your show.  Uh-huh.  Ever since back 20 years ago.  Why are you a fan of our show? 
[03:16:00]  Why am I a fan of your show?  First of all, I like you guys.  All right?  And second of all, when I was first introduced to you, you know, to you guys a long time ago,  I just took a liking to you.  I used to listen to you on WDW.  See, no, not...  See, she doesn't...  There's nothing there.  What are you talking...  You verbose ox.  No one cares.  Verbose.  I love you guys.  Don't you understand that?  Yeah, but you have no...  Who gives a fuck.  You have no example of what you even like. 
[03:16:30]  So does my mom, and I didn't even see her for Mother's Day.  Do you get it yet?  You have no idea what you liked about the show in the first place.  What'd your son do for Mother's Day?  He came over here.  That's good.  Did you try to keep your heavy drinking down to a minimum, or you said, fuck it?  No, he didn't say anything about my drink.  Did you vomit into the sink?  No, I did not.  No, Jimmy.  No, I didn't.  Did you piss yourself or shit yourself?  Yeah, did you say, nice flowers, but wait a minute, I gotta go vomit into the sink again? 
[03:17:00]  No, I did not.  You monster.  Did you share your crack with him?  First of all, I don't smoke crack.  When's the last time you smoked crack?  When was the last time you smoked crack?  I told you, two years ago.  Did I say two years ago?  Well, it was three, and then it was two, and then it was one.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.  It was a couple of years ago.  We're going home.  No, no, no. 
[03:17:30]  It was a few years ago.  Yes, it was.  All right?  Just keep her on the phone, because she runs out of energy.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  No, I'm not going to run out of energy.  No, no.  But I just wanted to find out.  You want me to dress in a frigging gown?  Are you there?  I'm not running out of energy. 
[03:18:00]  What are you doing, playing the silent game on me now?  Yeah, you guys are playing the silent game on me, huh?  Bill, did you hear this?  They want me to dress up in a frigging gown for the super show. 
[03:18:30]  How am I going to go there with a gown?  Are you guys there?  I haven't owned a gown in my whole entire life. 
[03:19:00]  Hello?  Yeah, I'm right here.  Yes.  Diana.  Yeah, it's me.  Oh, good.  What are you going to wear at the thing, super show?  First of all, who am I talking to?  Colin.  Colin Quinn?  Yes.  Oh, hi, Colin.  How are you doing? 
[03:19:30]  Hi.  I just heard your call.  It sounded like something we do need to talk about, because I'm wondering, what am I going  to wear?  Do I wear a suit or what?  Oh, jeez.  I don't have a black tie.  I have dress pants, and I have nice shirts.  Yeah, I have the same.  All right.  I mean, I have a jacket, but I don't have a tuxedo, for crying out loud.  You don't have a tuxedo?  You don't have a tuxedo?  Yes, you do.  Don't lie to me.  I have one from years ago, but I haven't worn it, and I don't even know where the hell 
[03:20:00]  it looks like.  It's probably got most balls.  Who knows?  Colin, listen to me.  All right.  First of all, is this really Colin Quinn, or are they playing a joke on me?  All right.  All right.  Now, but the whole thing is, for me to go out and get a dress gown, you know, for the  bed and everything, I mean, I don't know.  No.  I mean, first of all, I can't believe Marion's not coming, but second of all, I don't think 
[03:20:30]  you should go all, you know, just wear whatever you're comfortable in.  You know what I mean?  I mean, I think they're making a mountain out of a molehill with this, you know, they're  trying to make it into some big affair.  It's just, you know, it's an awesome thing.  No, I don't mind.  All right, Colin, I don't mind going.  That is not a big deal for me, all right?  But the thing is, though, even if I dress nice, I got to buy more jewelry, because don't  forget, when I got mugged, my jewelry was in my pocketbook.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:21:00]  All right?  Which is no big deal, because it was just costume jewelry.  Right, right.  Well...  But everything was in my pocketbook.  Yeah.  I think we should just go casual, you know?  All right.  Now, one more thing.  When is this event taking place?  That's the question.  I don't know.  I thought it was next Tuesday, but now I'm finding other things.  I'm not sure.  Ann, is this going to be on a Friday? 
[03:21:30]  No, I don't think so.  All right.  Now, I have something else I have to say.  June 18th, I have jury duty.  Oh.  And I don't know, yeah, believe it or not, I have jury duty, June 18th.  I'll believe it.  And I don't know if I'm going to be picked for one day, two days, and I don't know...  I know.  That's how jury duty is.  It's at least two days.  Let's see.  Yeah, at least two days. 
[03:22:00]  Now, did you hear from Sandy Kane?  Is she going to...  No, I did not.  All right.  Are you going to tell her to dress up in a gown, too?  Sandy Kane?  No, I just said, I don't think we should dress up.  I just said, I don't think we should dress up in gowns.  I'm just asking.  Did anybody tell Sandy Kane she has to dress up like that?  Yeah.  Like O.P. and Anthony just told me.  Nah.  Nah, I don't know.  I don't know either.  The whole thing's getting unwieldy. 
[03:22:30]  I do have nice dress clothes, but I don't have a gown.  Yeah.  Now I hear you.  All right.  Well, we'll figure it out.  We'll see what happens.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Stay beautiful.  I'll talk to you later.  I love you, too, Colin.  If that's you.  It's me.  Okay.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  Good.  No.  All right.  Stay off the fucking phone call. </pre>
