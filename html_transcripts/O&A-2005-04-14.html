<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with significant technical difficulties.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, struggled with extremely low headphone audio levels, particularly during a loud Howard Stern XM Satellite Radio commercial, leading to frustrated troubleshooting with the technical crew.  Caller Josh confirmed their audio problems.  The show then transitioned to a recurring bit about Opie's "pickled punk," a preserved fetus, and the bad luck it supposedly brought, leading to discussions of ritualistic disposal methods involving sage burning and returning it to its original giver, Andy Gore.  A call from Frank followed, detailing a story about "wheelchair Fred" defecating in his car and his fear of his 250-pound wife, Rocia, whom he was unable to put on the phone despite the hosts' encouragement.

The show then referenced the Terry Schiavo and Pat O’Brien controversies, segued into a sexually explicit voicemail, and introduced the upcoming guest, Tracy Morgan.  XM Satellite Radio executive Elo, who was in studio, discussed a recent dinner with the hosts (and Anthony's lateness), his radio background, and XM's new full-page newspaper ads featuring Opie, Anthony, and other celebrities, noting the absence of Jim Norton.  A confrontational and vulgar exchange ensued with caller "Dragon Wagon," an over-the-road trucker, offended by the show's content.  The hosts briefly discussed a humorous 1950s/60s hygiene video for developmentally disabled children, promising to play clips later.

Tracy Morgan then joined the show.  The conversation included sexually explicit boasts about his numerous children and sexual activity, an anecdote about pitching in underwear at a celebrity softball game, a shoving match with his cousin, and other humorous and sexually suggestive stories.  Colin Cosell (grandson of Howard Cosell) called in, recounting a story about Morgan showing an *SNL* intern a graphic pornographic video, and sharing anecdotes about his grandfather and other celebrities.  Further discussion covered Morgan's time on *SNL*, his views on the show's use of black talent, the cancellation of his own show, and sexually suggestive anecdotes about Britney Spears and Jennifer Aniston.  A caller's question about Morgan selling steaks led to a sexually suggestive reference to his brother "Spoonie Love."  The hosts played two 911 calls—one about fighting daughters, the other about a wrong Burger King order—provoking sexually charged and offensive commentary from the hosts and Morgan, who joked about child discipline and detailed his sexual preferences.  The segment ended with an update on the reprimanded 911 operator from the first call.


The final segment started with a caller complaining about a Western burger, prompting a highly exaggerated and offensive police fantasy involving arrest, body searches, and violent, sexually suggestive scenarios.  The hosts then discussed jail food and speculated offensively about the caller's marital status and mental state.  This was followed by playing audio clips from the 1950s/60s hygiene videos for developmentally disabled children, reacting with mockery and offensive humor, and describing the content in graphic detail with sexually suggestive commentary.  The show concluded with Tracy Morgan promoting his upcoming stand-up performances.

[00:04:30]  it's time to take XM Satellite Radio along for the ride.  XM gives you 100% commercial-free music.  It's the ultimate playlist with channels for album rock,  alternative, heavy metal, hip-hop, unsigned bands, blues, jazz.  There's an XM channel for everyone in the family,  including the biggest names in news, sports, talk, and comedy.  All in digital quality sound for less than $10 a month.  No wonder it's the most listened-to satellite radio service.  The XM Roadie from Delphi can turn any radio into an XM radio. 
[00:05:00]  It's the smallest satellite radio ever, so it looks great on your dashboard.  Plus, for a limited time, you'll also get a free home kit  so you can connect XM to any home stereo.  XM makes a great graduation or Father's Day gift.  Check it out.  Electronic stores including Best Buy and Circuit City,  Beyond AM, Beyond FM is XM Satellite Radio.  Ah, that's right, Howard.  That's right.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Am I on? 
[00:05:30]  I'm real low in the headphones, too, today.  You've got to push that up.  Well, I guess we could do a little of that.  Do this.  I don't know.  Try that.  Move that a little bit.  Oh, boy.  This is a problem.  Can you hear yourself?  I'm trying.  I apologize to the audience out there.  I really do.  I just want to apologize.  I know they're fixing this and they're trying and everything,  but when you went into the little Howard commercial there, 
[00:06:00]  I swear I thought my eardrums were going to explode.  But I couldn't hear anything before that.  I couldn't hear the intro music that was being played.  All right.  This might help to tech people out,  because when the Howard Stern XM Satellite Radio commercial was playing,  I could hear that really, really nice.  And then when I said, thank you, Howard,  my voice was very, very, very low.  Very low.  Extremely low, where I don't even think it made the air.  I don't know.  Now I can barely hear me in the headphones,  but I'm afraid now to turn it up too loud, 
[00:06:30]  because when you play something, I'm going to get blasted out.  Let me try this.  Hold on.  All right.  Let me try it.  I can play a couple things, too.  It's impossible.  I'm trying to tell you that.  What do you want?  You want the tears to come out of my eyes?  How does that sound?  That sounds fine.  How about this?  Beyond AM, Beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  Wow, that is blasting loud and distorted in my head.  That's really, really loud.  Yes.  All right, let me pot it down.  Wow.  No wonder it's the most listened to satellite radio service. 
[00:07:00]  All right.  Well, the volume on the CD player is a lot lower than everything else.  That's what I have to do.  I have to bring it all the way down to here.  Oh, you do?  I'm just saying stuff like that so the tech people will see.  Yeah, yeah, because they're in here watching right now.  I know, which makes it very uncomfortable to do a radio show.  We have to diagnose every day.  We have to do a little diagnosis before we start the show.  It reminds me of the old days at WAAF with Eric the Fat Dude.  Oh, yeah.  Who we love, actually.  He's a great guy.  Hey, buddy.  He would come in during our afternoon broadcast with drills and stuff to fix the studio. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  And he would just be drilling away.  Like, we're cranking out some great rock and roll, and he'd be, weee, weee, weee, weee,  you know, taking out bolts and stuff.  Drilling holes in the console.  During the show.  And then we'd go, Eric, we've got to talk.  So he would turn off all the equipment, and Anthony and I would try to be funny.  Back in those days, we were funny at, I don't know, two minutes at a time because we had  to get all that rock and roll music in.  That's right.  God forbid we drop the song to try to be funnier for a little longer. 
[00:08:00]  People aren't tuning in to listen to YouTube babble.  Play the music, boys.  So then, uh, as we're trying to be funny, Eric is looking up at us with a drill in his  hand and staring at us, waiting for the funny tan.  Yeah.  So he could go back to, weee, woo, woo.  It's pretty much, yeah, he was pretty much looking like, all right, are you done?  I got work to do here.  Like, that's the most important part of the radio, the radio station, 
[00:08:30]  is him fixing little things instead of what's drawn out over the air.  Well, because, I don't know, radio is just the silliest, silliest business out there.  Really is stupid.  It doesn't make sense on any level.  You know, you got one of these engineer guys,  and it has to be in the studio to, you know, fix things from time to time.  But these guys don't want to work weird hours like anyone else out there.  No.  So instead of coming in when less people are listening to the radio station, 
[00:09:00]  or in some cases, barely anyone, you know,  that means he would have to do all the work at midnight, let's say,  or one in the morning, two in the morning.  Who wants to do that job?  Nobody.  And there's no bosses ever really controlling the ship at a radio station.  No.  You know, so it's like, all right, well, you work nine to five like everyone else,  so you fix the studio.  Prime time.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Well, hopefully these problems will be taken care of. 
[00:09:30]  Well, the listeners will help us out.  Let's go to Philly and say hi to Josh.  Josh?  Yo, guys, how you doing?  Pretty good.  Let's just know that you guys sound good as far as your levels.  The sound effects sounded good, except for Howard.  He was fucking loud.  He blasted my ears out just like Anthony's.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Range Against the Machine was really low, though.  You could barely hear it after the first five seconds of it.  That'll teach him, Robin.  Yeah, but Derek might have just turned that down in the mix so Howard Stern's XM Satellite  Radio commercial can be heard loud and clear. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, is that what you did?  Yeah, I think that's what happened.  Confused everybody?  Should we play the commercial again?  I mean, we have to get these commercials in.  Oh, my God.  We have to.  We don't want XM all pissed off at us.  I'm tired of hearing that ass.  Howard was kind enough to do a commercial for the number one XM Satellite Radio provider.  Yes.  So we've got to make sure we get these commercials in.  Anyway, you're sounding better over there?  No, not at all.  It's just, uh, it's too low. 
[00:10:30]  Like, I don't have a nice, a nice booming sound when I talk into this.  And I'm still petrified that something's going to, I don't want to turn it up too loud  because I'm petrified something else is going to just pierce my eardrums.  From here, you sound fine.  I don't know if that helps.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I now sound like I'm underwater to myself.  You're a little underwater?  Yeah.  You are.  Look at you.  Swimming around.  Did they put that filter back in?  Did they put it back in?  Yeah, there's something going on.  Why?  I don't know.  They put a filter back in my mic.  Now I can't.  It just seems like the head, we were talking about this in the office. 
[00:11:00]  It seems like a headphone problem would be the simplest thing to figure out in a radio  station, studio.  It's like headphones are, it seems like a secondary little thing.  You just plug it into a headphone jack and you should hear it.  I don't know.  You know what's weird, though, to the listeners?  They're like, why are you guys complaining?  It sounds okay to us.  Well, listeners, it doesn't sound okay to us.  And it's all about us motherfuckers.  No, well, it just distracts you if you hear your voice differently in your headphones. 
[00:11:30]  That's all.  Or if you don't really hear it because it's very low in the mix or something.  So it really takes you out of the game.  That's all.  And then I get used to it by the end of the show.  Whatever my headphone sound du jour is, I get used to it by the end of the day.  Come in the next day, it's something completely different in a new horrific fashion that I  have to deal with.  They really got to start.  I'll get used to it.  They really got to start dumbing down radio again.  Yeah.  They really do.  They've gotten too high tech.  Oh, it's beyond high tech with, you know, when I thought we would be able to help with 
[00:12:00]  the problems until the tech god, Ed Schultz there.  Right.  So, well, I'm going to have to rewrite the code for the headphone jack and rewrite the code.  I'm like, what?  That's when I did, you know, this.  Yeah.  Are you writing in Atari Basic?  Yeah.  Is that the language?  That's when I did the international sign of, okay, I'm done here.  If X equals Y, then go 260. 
[00:12:30]  Rewrite the code.  What kind of code for the headphone jack?  Yeah.  It's just a headphone.  My God.  And, of course, there's some geeks out there going, well, that makes perfect sense to me.  I don't care.  For 99.9% of the population, they don't get it either.  Apparently, we're lower than we were yesterday.  It says Ant is lower than yesterday.  And Ophi is also low.  I got you pretty high up. 
[00:13:00]  The promo was booming.  Okay.  Where am I?  Oh, that's you.  I'm cranking you up.  Oh, that's me?  And myself up.  Yeah.  How's that?  I don't know.  Jimmy, talk.  Now you're loud almost.  Jimmy doesn't even want to talk?  They put the filter back in the mic.  I don't know why they did it, but it sounds awful against it.  For what?  It was out.  It was fine.  And now it's back in.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, why did we get the filter back in there?  Mars?  Wiki?  Someone?  You put the filter in and increase the gain.  All right.  We're increasing gains now, Anthony. 
[00:13:30]  And now they're fixing it live on the show.  Oh, this is the tech test show.  Oh, like we were talking about yesterday.  Yes, we should test the show on the air.  Here it is.  That's what you're hearing.  Why not?  The test show.  Let's go to Yukon, the trucker.  Yukon.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, Yukon.  Hey, I want to know, Obi, what time did you bring that pickle punk to the studio?  The punk has been here almost since day one. 
[00:14:00]  Pretty much the first or second week I brought it back in from my house.  Okay.  I was just thinking that maybe it was jinx in the studio.  Maybe you should get Pat and Monocchio in his nine toes to pedal down the D.C. with his  Flintstone feet.  I completely agree that the pickled punk is disrupting my life.  It's jinxing.  And now I think it's disrupting the life of everyone in the New York facility.  Yeah.  You know what?  I'm getting a lot of people asking about the pickled punk.  They want to take it off my hands. 
[00:14:30]  Can you just give it away?  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's...  Shouldn't we get some kind of one of those people with like a...  An exorcist?  Something.  Like maybe somebody with a crystal ball or something.  Some kind of voodoo?  Yeah, maybe read the palm of the pickled punk, see what life it was supposed to have.  I think some type of decent burial is in order for the pickled punk.  I...  Nope.  Nope.  No?  Nope.  I'm not taking a chance.  On what?  It might need a Christian burial or something. 
[00:15:00]  Like you figure if you just bury it, it'll be haunting.  I don't know what religion it is.  I don't know either.  You know, I really think the only solution to the pickled punk thing is to have Andy Gore  come back and get it.  And claim it?  Yes.  He really jinxed you by giving it to you.  Because now I think maybe he had a problem with it.  Identified it as the jinx pickled punk and gave it to you.  And now, you know, how do you get rid of it?  How do you dispose of a fetus? 
[00:15:30]  I think if you give it back to the person who gave it to you, then...  Oh, is that what you're saying?  Always good.  It's never that easy in movies.  It's never that easy.  You can't just give...  Once you give somebody a bad luck thing, it's not as simple as just going,  Hi, I'm returning this.  Thank you.  Why not?  Because you've got to go through some ritual or some very difficult thing or activity  or go to some strange, faraway place that's dangerous to get to.  That's the only way you can cure that.  Like the Brady Bunch, we were talking about the Tiki Idol. 
[00:16:00]  They couldn't just put it back.  They had to give it to Mr. Hanalei.  They had to tell him to go to the cave.  And Vincent Price was there.  And it's very dangerous for the kids.  But how about we burn something in all the corners of the room?  Like sage?  Is that the thing they burn?  I think they burn sage.  But it has to be burned in every corner of the room.  You can't just walk around the place with sage burning.  You have to burn it into each corner of the room.  You know that.  I do some of that reading sometimes. 
[00:16:30]  What the hell?  You burn it in the corner of a room?  Yeah.  It gets rid of the badness.  I thought you just had to wave it around.  No, you don't just wave sage around.  What am I?  I'm learning something new here.  Of course not.  You burn it and then you make sure it hits every corner of the room.  Someone will back me up on this one.  I'm not denying it.  I'm just saying I don't think that'll work unless you get rid of the pickled punk first in the appropriate fashion.  I think as soon as we get rid of the pickled punk, all is going to be good with the show. 
[00:17:00]  Could you imagine you get rid of it and everything miraculously just works here in the studio?  Oh, all of a sudden we have no, we're not butting heads with anybody at XM anymore.  It's just everything is fine with the world.  You got to get rid of that thing.  I blame it on the pickled punk.  It is the pickled punk.  That nasty little face.  What do we do?  I think.  Give it back.  I think we just give it back.  But there's got to be some kind of ceremony.  I think we give it back with some kind of ceremony with maybe some sage burning in the corners of the room. 
[00:17:30]  Burning sage in the corners of the room.  Yep.  Give it back.  I like it.  Yeah.  The sage, you kind of sold me with the sage.  Because I'm thinking you can't just give it back but a little sage.  But there's something missing.  I think we need to all come into work one day with robes.  With hoods.  Maybe like a robe with a purple hood.  And then we all just walk around with the sage.  Something like that.  And you guys will follow me. 
[00:18:00]  Whoa.  Turn the lights back on.  You're freaking me out, man.  You're scaring me.  Holy shit.  I was turning the lights down.  And I didn't even know you were turning the lights down.  I'm like, what the fuck is going on in here?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Sage.  Sage.  Hoods.  Hoods.  Hoods.  Hoods.  But there's no real element of danger involved.  Usually there's some kind of danger that has to be involved when we're turning these evil things.  Getting rid of it.  Well, we could all, like, I don't know, eat pea soup and see what happens.  See if we vomited back up. 
[00:18:30]  See if someone's head starts spinning around the room.  In evil fashion.  No, we're all going to get robes with hoods.  Yeah.  With some kind of weird, like, uh...  An emblem?  Some kind of weird emblem.  That's just silly.  That might be either good or bad.  We don't even know, you know?  Like the druids?  Maybe with, like, some kind of a star.  Like a half...  No, a half moon.  Half moon?  Half moon, a star, and a plus sign.  Nope.  Plus sign?  No pentagram, though.  No, no, no.  No evil. 
[00:19:00]  No, because we all know what that is.  Yeah.  It has to be some kind of emblem.  You really don't know what it is.  Okay.  But you know it's going to work.  And then you guys will have to follow me around the room as I'm burning the sage into each corner of the room.  How come we're involved in this?  It's your punk.  Yeah, but obviously it's affected the show.  It's affected this place.  You know, people's lives are a little strange these days.  Now the punk has been touched, though, by Mars.  Yeah, that's not good, but I had nothing to do with that.  But I had nothing to do with someone actually poking the pickled punk. 
[00:19:30]  Poking it.  All right.  You might have been sleeping and stuff, and now you woke him up.  Hey, look, we're looking up emblems online.  Yeah, I like that one.  I like the cross symbol with, like, the noose at the top.  Is that called an onk?  I have no idea.  How the fuck do you know it was an onk?  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  I just know it has a cross with, like, a noose thing at the top. 
[00:20:00]  And you know, do you know how to spell it?  No, I'm awful at spelling, Opie.  All right.  Sorry.  All right.  That's one thing Professor Anthony needs to study is his spelling skills.  Thank God for spell check.  God, and I used to get railed.  When I used to write things.  I use spell check now.  I defy you to find misspelling in the past even couple of years, I would say.  Well, I could break out the XM Satellite Radio contract.  I think you barely spelled your name right. 
[00:20:30]  I was probably drunk at the time.  All right.  See, I understand years ago I was, you know, very bad.  And when I had to write things, oh, it's just awful.  Now spell check is so easy.  Just pop it right in there.  It calls you an idiot.  It gives you the right spelling.  You move on.  You look like a genius.  All right.  We've got to figure out something with this pickled punk.  It's obvious.  Yeah.  I am a little frightened.  It has really kind of put a damper on the show.  Thank you.  Why did you even ask for it? 
[00:21:00]  It's the worst thing you could possibly have is a fetus staring at you through a glass jar.  It's cool if you go over, what's his name, Andrew's house and, you know, go on his tour  of all of his pickled punks.  But to have one, you don't want to have one.  Nah.  You walk through a freak show, you look at the bearded lady, you're not thinking of taking  her home.  You just kind of look at it, admire it as a freak and move on.  And all kidding aside, a lot of bad things happened after I got the pickled punk.  Yeah.  So I'm partly serious here, by the way. 
[00:21:30]  I don't want to give you the laundry list, but it was a really bad two and a half years.  But there's no guidelines as to what you do with it to get rid of any evilness that might  be a spread around.  In the movies, it's easy.  They go, oh, and I'm reading in this book that you have to do A, B, C, D.  All right.  Well, why don't we go down to one of those ancient bookstores somewhere in the village?  And maybe talk to the person behind the counter and they'll go, oh, yeah.  Who's been alive for like 400 years, but he still fits into society. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  That's mysterious.  Yeah.  And then maybe he could direct us to a book.  Yeah, a book that he has to go, oh, I got just what you need.  And he goes in the back and all of a sudden comes out with this book with a leather case  or something.  Necromonicon, yeah.  Yeah, and this goes, blows it off, and there's the title of the book.  And it's perfect for our situation.  And then you thumb through to...  Pickle punk removal.  Pickle punk removal section.  There's never a... 
[00:22:30]  It's never like that.  You never...  It's never that simple.  I can't wait to start smoking pot again because this sounds great.  It's like the old Asian guy in Gremlins downstairs.  Yeah.  You got to kind of, you know, find an out-of-the-way spot.  We have to go to a bookstore somewhere.  It's an out-of-place bookstore, but the guy has to have some kind of like long beard.  Long weird beard.  Long weird beard.  And it can't just be an old bookstore.  It's got to be like an occult place, though, doesn't it?  No.  Where they select books and charms.  That's the beauty of it. 
[00:23:00]  It could just be an old bookstore?  The Gremlins guy.  He was just kind of in this cool little shop.  This little shop.  And then it had that, you know...  Yeah, exactly.  All right, so it's an old bookstore.  Yeah.  But it can't be like a Borders or something.  Nah, nah.  It's got to be like an independent bookstore.  Independent.  You can't like go in there and get some coffee.  Yeah, nah.  An independent bookstore that might have some children's books off to the side a little bit.  Really?  Yeah, just a little bit.  Just to create the illusion.  Oh, that is legit?  And you might be using this bookstore for other things. 
[00:23:30]  But then what's like the secret word to let the guy know, look, we need a little more than  what you're showing out here?  A scar on my body.  What?  I don't even...  What?  Some kind of scar on my body.  And you show it and he goes, oh, I got what you need.  Exactly.  And he goes around back.  And he's been waiting a very long time for me to show up.  Like his whole life...  This isn't going to work?  His whole life has been just waiting for this moment where I show up to show the scar. 
[00:24:00]  What scar do you have?  I don't know.  I got a really bad scar from when I was a kid where I tried to open an orange juice  can.  That isn't it.  You mean that back then you were opening an orange juice can and that was sealing your  fate back then?  Who knows?  Now I'm starting to think.  It has to be something odd.  I tried to push the lid down and the edge of the orange juice can almost took my whole  thumb off.  Look, it's still there 20 some odd years later.  Dude, that means nothing. 
[00:24:30]  It would have to be some kind of strange occurrence.  If the orange juice lid mysteriously flung off the counter and zipped like a saw blade  into your finger, that's one thing.  You're opening up a can as a kid and that's putting this high sign scar on your thumb to  show the guy in the shop?  I believe it set me down the road and it brought us to this moment.  You're going to put your thumb up and he's going to be like, yeah?  What can I help you with, sir? 
[00:25:00]  You know what?  I never really notice what this scar spells out or something.  Maybe we should get a little ink and I'll press it down on a piece of paper to see what  it's all about.  By the way, that's going to be my new autograph when we go out.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  Just going to dip it in ink and give a thumbprint of your orange juice lid scar.  Because now the scar, because we've talked about it on the radio, is very famous.  We have learned that if you talk about something, it gets famous.  How many people are going to ask me to see the scar now?  Let me see the orange juice.  Out and about.  There it is. 
[00:25:30]  The orange juice can't scar.  All right.  So you're with me or what?  No, not with the scar.  I was up to you.  I was with you.  I'm feeling it because I want to get rid of this too.  But the scar thing.  All right.  What are you feeling?  Are you feeling like some weird emblem thing on our purple rose?  Oh, that's good.  No, because we've got to walk into the place and have some kind of weird emblem.  Maybe something around your neck.  Like a necklace thing or a ring or something that...  I've got this cool thing on my...  This cool cross thing that I wear all the time.  It's a cross.  Which, by the way, I've been walking around Manhattan and really bothering people. 
[00:26:00]  I just will hold it up and go, for the Pope.  For the Pope.  Really?  Yeah.  And they look at you like you have three heads.  Yeah.  This pot thing is going to work out just nicely.  You think it's going to be good?  Yeah.  I've got to start smoking that pot again.  I'm thinking a ring.  Some kind of ring that you've got to give the guy something and he sees the ring and goes,  oh, okay.  Like a decoder ring?  Yeah.  Something like that.  Maybe I have something in my apartment that is the missing piece of some kind of...  Right.  Some kind of ancient puzzle.  Well, somebody has it in their possession, of course, because fate would have delivered 
[00:26:30]  it to you years ago for just this moment.  Unlike your stupid orange juice hand scar, it would actually mean something.  So I should look for some kind of...  Have you come across any piece of jewelry or something with an emblem on it that you probably  would like, why am I keeping this?  I should throw it away.  But you just keep it and it's a little weird.  Well, I got a shark tooth necklace when I was in the Bahamas over vacation.  Yeah, that's...  No.  Seemed like just a thing to buy, but maybe that was it. 
[00:27:00]  You know what probably would have been it?  That finger bone necklace that you got years ago.  Dude, that's buried.  You buried it where?  In my parents' backyard.  See?  You've got to dig that up.  No way am I digging that up.  And wear that to the bookshop.  No way.  Of course.  It makes total sense now.  It was always the finger bone.  I had a human finger bone necklace, yes.  That Chuck Farnham gave me.  Chuck Farnham was selling these things.  He actually went to...  I know exactly where that is.  A supplier. 
[00:27:30]  I did bury that.  Of bones, of human bones.  He called it cannibal wear.  And Opie, in his sick fascination, once again, decided he was going to get one of these  things.  He wore it for a while, but noticed it stunk.  He would sit, doing the radio show, sniffing this thing all day.  To my disgust, he'd hold this finger bone up to his nose and just...  He'd be sniffing it all day long.  Maybe it's the missing bone that brings some kind of skeleton to life.  Ooh.  I know you're getting a little far-fetched. 
[00:28:00]  Why not?  You think that would be it?  But I think it's the bone that you have to wear around your neck to show the guy at the  bookstore that's going to then let him know what we need to get rid of the bad karma  and the fetus, the pickled punk.  I think you've got to dig up the finger bone.  You know where it is?  Yeah, I do.  It's still got the leather around it?  It's kind of buried in the pet cemetery section of our backyard.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, great.  You could dig up a cat bone by mistake?  The guy's going to go, that's a cat bone.  I can't help you. 
[00:28:30]  It could be...  I think it's...  Yeah, I think it's buried close to one of my cats that we buried or one of the goldfish  we lost.  Did you bury it with the rawhide that tied around your neck?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  Did you put it in a box or did you just bury it in the dirt?  No, man.  Let nature take its course.  All right.  Well, it could still...  I don't think it decomposed that fast.  How long ago did you bury it?  Dude, that's years ago, right?  Yeah.  I'm trying to remember.  Probably three, four, maybe.  Oh, at least.  Could be five years ago.  I think it's five years. 
[00:29:00]  Dude, you've got to dig it up now and put it around your neck and we've got to go to  the bookstore.  Imagine I walk in with my hair all askew like Ben and I've got this necklace around my neck  that says rotting and dirty and...  But that'll tip him off.  Little maggots crawling all over it.  And it makes sense because it's not easy.  All right, it's not all that difficult, but it's not something sitting around like the  scar on your thumb.  You've got to go back.  You've got to find where you buried it.  You've got to dig up this thing that's been gone for years now. 
[00:29:30]  It's a human bone.  Buried.  Dig it up.  Put it back around your neck.  Now we've got to go to the bookstore.  Now it's all coming together.  This makes sense now.  So the guy is going to recognize the bone necklace?  He'll see the bone necklace.  Then he'll know what our problem is because this whole thing is tied together.  So then he'll get that book that no one has really looked for.  Right.  And then in there will be the instructions how to get rid of this pickled punk and the  bad luck that it has brought. 
[00:30:00]  This is beautiful.  This is going to work.  All right, dig it up.  When are you going out?  What if I can't find it?  You have to.  All right.  I will always find it in the movies.  I will try to find the bone necklace.  I've got to find it.  Opie Potter will be our only hope.  Can we see the pickled punk today?  No.  I don't want to look upon it.  I don't want to look upon it anymore.  I just want to make sure Mars didn't wreck it by poking it too hard. 
[00:30:30]  Dude, don't look at it.  Leave it sealed up in the box.  Is it still in the box?  Do not gaze upon it.  I don't think it's cool that we disrespected the pickled punk.  What's this wee shit?  I didn't touch it.  I want whatever's in charge of the pickled punk to know.  Don't.  Get it out of here.  Dude, you're suffocating it.  Don't bring it in here.  Let it breathe.  No.  Let the pickled punk breathe.  No.  Let it see the light.  Why are you doing this?  Get it out of here.  Why is it sealed up like that? 
[00:31:00]  Are you guys sending it to the FBI?  It's got a rubber band around the box.  It says, punk, this side up with an arrow.  What disrespect.  The punk has to see.  Has to see.  Oh, God.  No.  No.  If he sees, then he does.  Put the punk back.  It's in a box.  For some reason, it's got this mystic rubber band around it that holds in.  It's able to hold him in.  You know, usually it's in some chain with an inch.  An ancient lock of, you know, something that holds it in. 
[00:31:30]  And if you take that off, then the evil gets out.  This is a rubber band from the supply closet.  Shouldn't it be some kind of ancient lock where only one person has the key?  Dude, that should be in some crafted wooden box with carved emblems on it.  With some weird lock that's ancient golden lock.  With a key that is only held by the high priest.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Who could just be one of our interns, and we didn't know he was a high priest. 
[00:32:00]  It's in a goddamn iPod box with a rubber band around it.  What?  No wonder it's pissed.  We stink as being sorcerers.  Years ago, this thing, for years, this thing has been on this earth.  This punk, we've been told, is, is, could be, could be, it's at least 90 years old, could be over 100 years old.  And, and it's, it's been here on this earth.  Think of where it's been.  What it's seen.  What it's been contained in. 
[00:32:30]  And it ends up in 2005, in a, in a cardboard box with a rubber band around it.  Of course it's pissed.  We're not giving it the respect it deserves.  That's why I think we have to get it out of the box immediately.  No, no.  Immediately.  Look.  And let it see some, let it get some sunlight today.  It's pissed off, but you gotta leave it where it is.  You don't just pull it out all pissed.  We gotta figure, you gotta dig up that bone.  You gotta go, we gotta go to the bookstore.  Where's the bookstore?  I don't know. 
[00:33:00]  That's part of the mystery.  We're gonna be going into 10 bookstores.  And, and, and go, hello, to the counter guy.  And he's gonna, can I help you?  And then you'll, you'll just tap the bone with your finger.  Are the Hardy Boys still working?  Perhaps you haven't seen this around my neck, sir.  That's lovely.  What can I help you with?  Yeah, what, how, oh.  I will be so disappointed if somebody doesn't look at, pawn that bone around your neck and  go, oh, I know what you need. 
[00:33:30]  And I just know it's not gonna work, because shit like this never works.  Maybe we should just, you know, I just, I don't know, to finish this up, maybe we should  just come up with our own ceremony and hope for the best.  It's gotta be based on something, though.  You know, it's gotta be based on some ritual that's tried and true.  It's gotta be some kind of burial ritual.  I think, I think, I don't want to keep, you know, pounding this into the ground, but  I think we have to give it back to Andy Gore with some kind of ceremony. 
[00:34:00]  Right.  Okay.  You have to give it back to that.  I can't take the responsibility of thinking it needs a burial.  Right.  No, I agree with you on that, but it's, this needs to be some type of ceremony.  Whether it was a burial ceremony or some other kind of, a passing of the, a passing of the  Somewhere along the line, the link was broken.  Right.  So, the link was broken when Andy Gore gave it to me.  Right.  So, I have to give it back to Andy Gore.  The punk belongs to certain people. 
[00:34:30]  It's their fate to possess the punk throughout history.  Andy, of course, is one of those people that is meant to possess the punk.  You, on the other hand, were not.  Obviously.  You weren't meant to.  So, we bring it back to Andy.  So, Andy gets it back.  And then he'll find the next person that was really supposed to have this thing.  Right.  Or actually, that, it just happens.  Like, how did Andy get it?  I don't know.  Do you remember?  You didn't even get a history of this punk before you got it?  You're taking possession of something that's probably a century old. 
[00:35:00]  Dude, isn't it?  And you didn't get a history like, all right, where did it come from?  It's not even a good pickled punk.  Shh.  It's a fine.  It's a fine punk.  It's a fine punk.  Shh.  Landru will hear you.  There are witches.  There are witches.  I love that Star Trek.  That's like two episodes, but.  Landru will hear you.  It's a wonderful punk.  Someone's suggesting we bury the punk next to Chester. 
[00:35:30]  No, Chester isn't buried.  Chester is premated in an urn, by the way.  And for you people that are keeping track, my ex-mother-in-law has kept Chester's ashes.  And when she passes, she has told people she wants the ashes buried with her.  There you go.  All right.  Someone wants Pat from Menaki to drive it down to Louisiana.  Someone wants to know if Andy Gore's been having good luck ever since he gave me the punk. 
[00:36:00]  Someone is saying give the punk a proper burial.  And, of course, Pat from California, send the punk to Scott Peterson.  Oh, Jesus.  He knows how to get rid of him.  Melanie from Cleveland says, don't go digging up any bones.  I'll write a spell for you.  It will take care of everything.  And, yes, you can find spells and witchcraft books at Borders.  Or go to a metaphysical shop.  A few candles, a spice, and a chant, and it will be okay. 
[00:36:30]  What kind of spice?  A little witch.  Is it sage?  Yeah.  What am I going to use?  A little cinnamon?  If you guys want a cinnamon.  Oregano.  Oregano.  Take the fetus.  Now add a little oregano.  This is going to be wonderful.  Before we're going to get rid of all the evilness that has entered your life, take this little,  now add a little cumin and some cinnamon on here.  Wonderful.  Now whisk the little guy up with some, what spice do you use?  Yeah, you can't just.  Now put the blender on for a pay. 
[00:37:00]  I got a really good spice that makes your pizza taste really good.  Oh, maybe that'll work.  It's kind of like a, I think it's called like a pizza spice.  I'm going to take the bite out of the head that Jimmy described yesterday and it's tasty.  It has a little red pepper in it and a little oregano and some other things.  I don't think we'll be putting any spice in it.  Well, if you guys want to send in your chants, maybe we can pick the best one.  A chant?  Is that what she said?  Yeah, do a chant.  Someone says, Rev from Whackbag, I'll be seeing Andy at the end of the month at the 
[00:37:30]  Chiller Theater Convention.  That's all well and good, but I'm not trusting anyone else.  If you'd like, I'll personally deliver it to him.  You know that I know him and I'm a faithful ONA fan.  I wouldn't lie to you.  No, we understand and I would truly trust Rev to do this, but I don't think that works  because then it would be Opie breaking the chain by giving it to Rev, who then gives  it back so Rev gets rid of the bad luck, but Opie still has it because you broke the chain. 
[00:38:00]  And what if Rev is crossing the street and all of a sudden just kind of trips?  Oh, boy.  It happens.  Spolat.  Exactly.  By the way, the punk is now breathing nicely.  God damn it, I looked at him!  You motherfucker.  You know those seats where the listeners kind of take a look at us as we broadcast our show?  The Pickled Punk is sitting up nice.  All is good with the world, at least for this moment.  Oh, God.  Could you please get rid of that thing?  Oh, my God.  Why did you take it out of the box? 
[00:38:30]  It had to get...  Put it back in the box.  Put it back in the box.  It had to be taken out of the box, Anthony.  It had to.  Let's say hi to Chad.  Chad?  What's up, fellas?  Hey.  Hey, you guys see that movie Red Dragon?  Who was in Red Dragon?  It's a prequel to the Hannibal Lecter movie.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, yeah.  You know where Ralph finds, like, he's being controlled by that painting, so he has to  break into the Brooklyn Museum of Art and eat the painting to stop it from controlling  him?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:39:00]  I think you've got to cut that thing up and the slices down and at least don't have to  eat a piece of it.  No, you don't have to eat it.  I know that's not true.  All right, thank God.  Whatever you do, send the fluid to Microsoft so you can gargle with it.  It'll improve his breath.  Jersey Joe from Jersey, obviously.  Hey, how you doing, fellas?  What's up, Jersey Joe?  I think it's obvious where your fate changed, and you should not actually wear Chester's  broken rib around your head.  All right, Jersey Joe. 
[00:39:30]  Punching out.  What an ass.  Let's go to Frank from Jersey.  We officially talked to Frank for the first time during one of our Boston broadcasts.  Oh, this is the Frank?  Yes.  Frank, what's up?  Hey, guys.  A few things happened after the show, and I thought I'd cheer.  Oh, yeah.  You had no idea what was going on at the Paradise when everyone was just openly laughing at you.  I listened to the replay.  It was hysterical. 
[00:40:00]  And I appreciate what you guys put me on the show.  It was fun.  Good.  Okay.  So what's going on, Frank?  I drove Fred home.  You know, on the way home, we were listening to the replay.  Fred was, like, laughing a little bit, and something started smelling funny.  Oh, no.  So what I did was crack the window open.  You know, I had the air connection, but I cracked the window open. 
[00:40:30]  Uh-huh.  And, you know, I didn't pay much money.  I figured he, you know, he had a loose down there, so maybe he let one go.  Right.  So, you know, we kept driving another few miles.  It started, even with the windows open, now it really started stinking.  Oh, no.  Okay.  So I go to Fred and say, Fred, is something going on down there?  And he gave me a look like a baby would look when he's jumping a load. 
[00:41:00]  Uh-oh.  So what was it?  Oh, my God.  I hear something going on.  Yeah.  Well, did he crap himself?  Obviously, he crapped himself, right?  I wasn't sure.  And so, uh, actually pulled up by his, uh, oh, boy.  I'm in trouble now.  Just plow through.  What did you do? 
[00:41:30]  Uh, I pulled up by his, uh, house and, uh, opened the door, let him out, and when he got up,  there was a little vein there on the peak.  Oh, no.  On your seat.  Oh, on the seat that he was sitting on.  And, uh, uh, Fred, Fred looked back and said, ah, that'll come out.  But, uh, hello? 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, we're listening.  Oh, my God.  He is easily distracted, isn't he?  I hear the music in the background.  I, I think, I think you're looking at it.  Frank.  Yes.  Did he, he actually crapped in your front seat of your car?  He, he made something in his, in his pants.  Right.  It obviously leaked, whatever the juice was that was in a tent, leaked through to the seat.  Choo.  And left a nice, uh, like, brownish yellow stain. 
[00:42:30]  Now, do you have leather or cloth seats?  Cloth.  Cloth.  So, it soaked in to your cloth seats.  You didn't then push him out of the vehicle at 60?  Maybe, if someone shit on my, in my car, I would have to kill them.  Did, did, what did you, did you then have to wash it out?  I mean, obviously you washed it.  I went to the, the store, it was like a supermarket down the street, after I dropped them off.  And I got some of that four, uh, that formula four or five or four or nine, whatever. 
[00:43:00]  Uh-huh.  I started squirting it.  It was like a small stuff.  Then I started squirting it on there and rubbing it around.  It got really big.  It was like a big, huge, it just, it just spread out like it was concentrated.  Did you put your nose down there to see if you got it out?  No.  Yes, you did.  It was, it was, it was pretty, pretty bad.  Does it still stink in there now?  Oh, uh, it still has, uh, a scent of thread, yeah.  Oh. 
[00:43:30]  You know, that'll never come out of your vehicle.  It's in the foam in your seats.  And now when, on a hot summer day when your car's been sealed up for a while and the sun's  blasting through and you open it up, you're going to smell Fred's ass.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You know, it was, I think it was a little mistake by, like, taking Fred on, but, you know,  I don't know.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, you're a good egg, Noonan.  No, but the, the bad part was, when I got home, I mean, uh, my wife actually listened 
[00:44:00]  to the show and, uh, that Miss Piggy thing didn't work out too good.  She has no sense of humor, huh?  Oh, my God.  She has absolutely no sense of humor, your wife?  I don't know, I heard the replay, I, I didn't realize I said Miss Piggy and it all tied into  the thing and that didn't, uh, come over to me.  How much does the lovely Mrs. Frank weigh?  Uh, I don't want to say. 
[00:44:30]  Come on, Frank.  How much?  How much, Frank?  Guys, I've already.  Give us a ballpark, Frank.  Uh, deuce 50.  Deuce 50.  Yeah.  Let me just say, wow.  Your wife weighs 250 pounds and you're calling her Miss Piggy live on a national talk show?  Oh, boy, Frank.  He's laughing like Kermit.  Hey, hey, Frank, um, how long have you been married? 
[00:45:00]  Uh, about three years.  Three years?  Now, I want honesty from you, Frank.  You've been an honest guy.  I assume you'll, you'll be honest.  What did she weigh when you married her?  Uh, two, like 150, 140.  140, 150.  So, she, she was a big girl, um, not, not like fat, fat, but kind of, kind of big.  How tall is she?  Uh, like 5'7".  5'7", 140.  That's not bad, really.  That's fine.  That's all right.  That's fine.  Um, she's tacked on a hundred pounds since you've been married? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Holy Jesus.  Frank, what happened?  I don't know.  She, she likes to eat a lot?  Is that it?  Exactly.  Exactly.  And do you, do you look sometimes and go,  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, my God.  She's in the back room.  I better not.  What?  What's, where are you, home?  Yeah, yeah.  I was about to go to work.  Could you put your wife on the phone, please?  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:46:00]  What do you think she's on?  Oh, oh, my God.  What?  I'm in trouble now.  She, uh, she, she didn't know I called you guys, so.  Hand her the phone.  Just tell her not to eat it.  Yeah.  Put, put, put her on the phone, please, Frank.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no, no, no.  I wouldn't, you want to talk to Opie and Anthony?  Opie and Anthony, I swear.  Oh, okay.  What?  Oh, oh, she's giving me those looks.  What's, what'd she say?  It's not, I'm talking to Opie and Anthony.  Frank, be a man.  Frank, you got to stand up for yourself. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, my God.  She goes to me and says, Opie and Anthony can take, take, uh, you home.  I'm in trouble.  Holy, what's.  Just hand her the phone, Frank.  I have to talk with her.  You want, it's, you want to talk to Opie and Anthony?  Listen to this poor, broken man.  You spend more time with them than you spend in your house, so go over there.  Is she a sister?  Okay.  Okay.  Guys, I better, I better hang up.  I mean.  Frank, no, no, don't, don't hang up yet, Frank. 
[00:47:00]  Frank, don't hang up.  You hear what she said?  You spend more time, you know, hanging out with them, and we barely see the guy.  Then you do hang out with me.  Frank, Frank, Frank.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Frank.  Yes?  What nationality is your bride?  Dominican.  She's Dominican, huh?  Mm-hmm.  Does she kick your ass?  Yeah, yeah.  Because you sound like you're really afraid of your wife.  Oh, she definitely does have that ability.  Has she ever hit you?  Yes, yes. 
[00:47:30]  Has she punched you close fists?  Yes, yes.  In the face.  Yes.  Jesus Christ, Frank.  You are afraid.  You are afraid of your 250-pound wife.  Yes.  Yes.  Maybe I should just hang up because I don't want to.  No, Frank, Frank.  I have to sleep in the house with her.  Frank, you've got to stand up for your rights.  Oh, God.  Tell her that Opie and Anthony want to speak to her now. 
[00:48:00]  Be assertive.  You want to talk to him just one second?  You want to talk to him?  I don't want to talk to him.  You want to just say hello?  Just say hi?  I do it.  Just say hi.  I don't want to say hi.  Hi.  Hello?  Say hi.  Hi, Mrs. Frank.  Hello?  She said she don't like you anymore.  Hello?  Why?  Why?  We didn't call her fat.  What's her name?  Rocia.  Rocia?  Well, this is so much my bad name. 
[00:48:30]  Uh-oh.  Now she said she don't give me anybody her name.  Oh, my God.  I better just end it.  No, no.  You know something, Frank?  You are in such a sorry situation.  Who?  You're married to a woman that you are petrified of.  I say that you have to be assertive and give her the phone and say,  Oh, B. and Anthony want to talk?  And you go, Will you talk with them, please?  Like you're all scared shitless of this woman.  That's what marriage is for you?  It's not based on love? 
[00:49:00]  It's based on fear?  I guess so.  I guess so.  Oh, my God.  We're learning a lot about Frank today.  I have never felt so bad for anybody in my life.  Frank, stick up for yourself.  Frank, be a man.  And while you're at it, get some locks for the refrigerator.  Frank, what was it like when you first met Rocia?  Well, she worked for the plumbing company that I worked for.  She was like a receptionist, and I sort of went out with her a few times. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah, and what was that like when you first were dating?  Was she sweet?  Is she a buddy nicer now?  Uh-oh.  Okay.  She heard what I said.  I don't know.  She says, find somebody nicer now.  Oh, my God.  Was she a sweet girl on those first dates?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you never imagined that someday she'd punch you in the face?  Frank?  Uh-oh.  She says, I'm backstabbing her.  I better just...  Frank.  Do you know what a hossa is, Frank? 
[00:50:00]  It's your wife that don't fly straight.  Get a load of Frank's wife.  Frank, you got to stick up for yourself.  Fight back.  Get in there.  Yeah.  Throw a few punches.  Let's go.  Oh, my God.  Get well soon from your battered husband, Frank.  She listens to the replays of the show, right?  Or is she listening right now in the other room?  To listen to the replay.  Okay. 
[00:50:30]  Here's one for the replay.  Frank's wife.  Frank told us in Boston off air that he wants you to stop eating.  Oh, my God.  Don't...  Frank told us that you are now a fat pig.  He was in love with you when you first met, but you've gained a hundred-some-odd pounds,  and Frank's not happy about that, but he's too scared to tell you.  So as Frank's friends were telling you, you need to stop eating.  Right. 
[00:51:00]  There you go, Frank.  I did it just like you told me.  There you go.  You got to be assertive.  You got to let her know what you're feeling, Frank.  Guys, I have a great idea.  So she doesn't hear the replay, I'm going to, like, cut the wires on the radio so she doesn't hear it.  He's actually going to do this.  Mark, this was a great call.  I think everything's going to be cool now.  I have a good idea.  I'll cut the wires on the phone on that thing, and she'll never hear this. 
[00:51:30]  He could be the wimpiest husband that listens to this radio show.  This is beyond pussy-whipped, Frank.  Oh, God.  You are beyond pussy-whipped.  Frank, you realize you could get a better broad if this goes bad, right?  Your wife's 250 pounds, and she's controlling you.  Completely controlling you.  You are afraid of your wife.  You could get a girl that weighs 200 pounds with a good personality.  There you go.  Let me tell you the deal.  I was married before her, and, you know, I had a lot of cash, a lot of money, everything, 
[00:52:00]  and I lost so much everything.  And then I remarried now, and I finally got a nice cash bucket, and I don't want to lose  that again.  Why, why, why do people get married a second time?  I don't get it.  Is there anything about love in there, Opie?  He's married and staying married because he's got a little nest egg that he doesn't want  to lose now, and he's got a wife who gained 100 pounds since they were married.  It doesn't sound like there's, the only passion there sounds like the passion she has to just 
[00:52:30]  beat down this poor man.  And this guy is trapped.  I hear a child.  You're a father?  Yes, I have a son with her, yeah.  How old is your son?  Seven months old.  Seven months old.  Aw, that's adorable.  All right.  And do you hope to have, Frank?  Guys, you know what I'm saying?  Do you hope to have another litter?  Oh, my God.  Is that my idol, Norton, Jimmy Carson?  Of course it is.  Of course it is. 
[00:53:00]  Frank, put your wife on the phone, man.  We're not going to be mean to her.  We don't understand.  Tell her we want to talk to her.  We need her side of this.  Yeah, we want to work this out for you guys.  Are you still talking about, I bet, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, we're going to go to your show.  We love you, man.  Thank you.  Don't do this to me, man.  No, no, no.  Dude, dude, dude, I just want to, I think that you're misrepresenting your wife.  We want to just chat with Marlon Brando for a second.  It's nothing bad.  Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  Let's get her side.  Yeah, let's get her side.  Frank, demand.  We want to be fair.  Yeah, Frank, we want you to demand that your wife talks to Opie and Anthony. 
[00:53:30]  Come on.  Let's hear you demanding.  Let's go.  Be a man.  No, no, guys.  Come on.  Be a man.  Be a man.  Let's hear Frank demanding that his wife talks to us.  Let's go.  All right.  Here we go.  Come on, guys.  Listen, guys, I'd do anything to you guys, but don't talk to me.  Frank, Frank, Frank, grab a hold of your balls.  Take a deep breath and demand that she talks to Opie and Anthony.  And say, woman.  Guys, guys, let's change the subject.  Let me talk about. 
[00:54:00]  You talk to Opie and Anthony, woman?  Let me tell you what happened in the car where we're talking to wheelchair Fred.  Let me tell you.  Frank, at this point, we could care less about wheelchair Fred.  It's not about Fred anymore.  Frank, stand up for yourself right now.  Frank.  Frank, listen to us.  Get a hold of yourself.  What's the matter with you?  Frank.  Frank.  Oh, my God.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  Exactly.  Come on, Frank.  Frank.  Tell her.  Focus. 
[00:54:30]  This is what happened.  I was driving wheelchair Fred home.  No.  We don't want to hear about wheelchair Fred.  Frank.  Frank.  Tell your wife to get on the goddamn phone and use those words.  Go get on this goddamn phone.  Oh, my God.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it.  What was she saying?  Hello?  Frank?  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  I think she hung up because there was something going on. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, there's something went on.  I have never heard a more pussy whipped, fearful man in my life.  Oh, my God.  He's the most.  Oh, we should ask what their wedding song was.  Probably all romantic and sweet.  And now it's just he's a battered, battered man.  I think I got their wedding song, actually.  All right.  Let me play this little.  This is Frank and his wife's wedding song.  All right.  All right.  Oh, jeez. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  I remember this old ditty.  It's a great song.  This goes out to Frank's wife.  Your butt is wide.  Well, mine is too.  Just watch your mouth or I'll sit on you.  Now, the word is out.  Better treat me right.  Now, cause I'm the king of cellulite.  Ham on.  Now, am on.  Ham on whole wheat. 
[00:56:00]  Now, all right.  Now, my zippers bust.  My buckles break.  Now, I'm too much man for you to take.  Now, I remember this.  Now, I've got to get to the hook now.  I've got more chins than Chinatown.  Uh-oh.  I never used a phone booth.  And I never seen my toes.  When I'm going to the movies.  Come on, Frank's wife.  Shake it.  I hang up seven rooms because I'm fat. 
[00:56:30]  I'm fat.  Come on.  You know I'm fat.  I'm fat.  You know I'm fat.  You know I'm fat.  You know I'm fat.  I'm fat.  Come on.  You're too skinny.  Don't you call me Pudgy Portly or Stout.  Just tell me once again who's fat.  That's it.  That poor bastard.  People asking how large is Frank?  How would you describe Frank?  Frank is...  Frank's not fat.  I think he's kind of tall.  I think he's like six foot, six one maybe.  About 170, 175 maybe. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  He's like an old man in shape.  Frank has like a body like Jack LaLame when he was 75.  Yeah, there you go.  Muscles and old man like Clint Eastwood in a way.  Yep.  Strapping.  He looks like a German, a Nazi soldier.  Yeah.  He's got that look.  Like if you put him in that Nazi uniform he'd fit perfectly.  That's how he looks.  Without the courage.  Yeah.  I bet you he's a cuckold.  Huh?  He's a cuckold.  He probably likes her to humiliate him and spit on him and smack him around.  Yeah.  I don't think there's a fetish thing going on.  I don't want to excuse it as some kind of fetish.  This is just a beaten, broken man who is in a horrible marriage with a woman that gained 100 pounds and he's afraid to say anything. 
[00:57:30]  He just watched her shovel food into her mouth for years and gain 100 pounds and was too scared to say boo to this woman.  And now he's in this miserable marriage.  Did you see how scared he is?  The guy is petrified of his big fat wife.  She punched him in the face.  She punches, big Dominican fatty, punches him in the face. 
[00:58:00]  Wow.  All right.  Well, uh, hmm.  This poor bastard.  Yeah.  What's up, Hector?  Good morning, Owen.  Hey, what's up there, Sandy Nipples?  Hi, Hector.  Not you.  Anyway, guys.  That's getting old.  Wow, I didn't know I was going to crash.  Listen.  All right.  Actually, I feel cool.  I always wanted to crash.  Listen.  Check it out, guys. 
[00:58:30]  I'm a Puerto Rican from Brooklyn.  Uh-huh.  And right now, within years, I've become surrounded by Dominicans.  Yeah.  Okay.  There's more Dominicans in Brooklyn than there is in the Dominican Republic.  Yeah.  And the problem is, these women are controlling.  When you first meet them, oh, they're the sexiest, most sweetest, most nicest women around.  Okay.  All of a sudden, once you put the ring on their finger, they'll put on 100 pounds, and they 
[00:59:00]  turn into these freaking controlling monsters.  Wow.  Is that how Dominican women are?  I'm telling you.  I would not want to say all of them, but I could pretty much bet the red check about 70%  of them.  Well, you know, there are a lot of stereotypes out there, and a lot of them based on fact.  That's the truth.  So, you know, you get, every race has their stereotypes as far as the women go.  Italians, Jewish women, they all got these stereotypes, Dov, and I guess Dominicans, like  Hector's saying, they blow up into big, angry beach balls. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, but I have a message for Frank.  Yeah.  Okay.  Run!  Just run!  Let me tell you, if he has just one kid with her, family court, child support, that's  only 70% of his check, you'll live.  70% of his check.  Oh, no shit.  No, 17, 17.  Oh, okay.  All right.  You'll live.  He'll be okay.  Anyway, guys, listen, I'm, I kept...  Be quiet.  All right.  Yeah, enough.  Wow, who knew that Frank was in a living hell? 
[01:00:00]  No wonder.  A lot of this makes sense now.  No wonder he had no problem cleaning up wheelchair Fred's shit from that hotel room.  He walked into a, he stayed with Fred while we were up in Boston in a hotel, little days  in or something, and let Fred stay in the room with him.  Fred went to the bathroom in the morning, and Fred being in a wheelchair, I guess he  doesn't have quite as good control of his bowels as the regular person.  He crapped, and it got all over the bathroom. 
[01:00:30]  Fred said he was in the bathtub, and he accidentally dumped, and then tried to rinse it off at the  shower head, and instead knocked it all over the bathroom.  And Frank went in there and saw this, and any normal person would beat Fred over the  head and say, what did you do?  You crapped all over the bathroom.  But he went in there and cleaned it up.  And it makes perfect sense now.  He's such a beaten man that a bathroom full of crap tells him, clean me up.  And I bet he had a deep voice before he met this woman.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  And now he sounds like Kermit.  Sounds like Kermit.  From so many times of going, oh, I'm sorry.  Getting that voice, that non-threatening voice up there.  So perish the thought, you know, he puts on a manly voice that might upset his wife.  So he's cultivated that higher voice.  Oh, don't hurt me.  Oh, please don't punch me in the face, you Dominican pig.  Probably taking a couple shots of the voice box.  Oh, maybe.  Maybe, right?  God, that poor bastard.  All right, we better take our first break. 
[01:01:30]  Wow.  It's sad.  Wow.  We're talking about pickled punks and Frank the wuss this morning.  We have Howard Stern talking about XM Satellite Radio.  We've got to get another one of these commercials in.  Sure.  It's so funny because I went to the message boards after the show yesterday, and everyone's  all excited, like, oh, my God, got to tune in Howard tomorrow because he'll have some  kind of response.  No, he won't.  He's a pussy is what it is.  He's a pussy, and he'll take whatever we dish out.  That's right.  He can't fight this game anymore. 
[01:02:00]  So once again, here's Howard Stern talking about XM Satellite Radio.  If you're planning a road trip this weekend, it's time to take XM Satellite Radio along  for the ride.  XM gives you 100% commercial-free music.  It's the ultimate playlist with channels for album rock, alternative, heavy metal, hip-hop,  unsigned bands, blues, jazz.  There's an XM channel for everyone in the family, including the biggest names in news, sports,  talk, and comedy, all in digital quality sound for less than $10 a month.  No wonder it's the most listened-to satellite radio service. 
[01:02:30]  The XM Roadie from Delphi can turn any radio into an XM radio.  It's the smallest satellite radio ever, so it looks great on your dashboard.  Plus, for a limited time, you'll also get a free home kit, so you can connect XM to any  home stereo.  XM makes a great graduation or Father's Day gift.  Check it out.  Electronic stores, including Best Buy and Circuit City.  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O-A-Day virus. 
[01:03:00]  Lee, I want you to be very honest.  Yes.  I'm going to put you on the spot here.  How annoying was Jim Norton, as far as the Robert Plant picture goes?  Don't hold back.  I guarantee you, as we...  You know, with respect to his tenacity in acquiring a photograph, it was unbelievable.  I've never seen anything like it.  Probably, well, it was back in the late 60s.  Someone really, really wanted to meet Hendrix.  I think it was 67. 
[01:03:30]  That's comparable, right?  That was comparable.  But since then, nothing like Jimmy trying to get the picture of the plant.  It was unbelievable.  It was absolutely unbelievable.  The vicious tenacity, the intensity.  That sounds better than just calling him a nudge.  I was a nudge, I'll admit that.  Oh, it's ridiculous.  But the photo is scary.  You've seen it.  Oh, it's horrible.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, it's classic.  I've got it on my trio right now.  The little smiling faces.  His little lock over my face.  Yeah, the hair is touching your face.  Little men just smiling. 
[01:04:00]  His head is as big as a pumpkin.  It really is awful.  I've never seen a bigger head in my life.  But you have to do it that way to get Robert Plant.  You have to do it that way.  He even said he's a tough one.  His people are very protective.  He's a very tough one to get.  You have to...  But Lee's a very important man, and he had a lot to do that day.  I would just pop in and ask him.  You didn't care about everything else he needed to take care of that day.  I do want you to know.  Just went in there and said, look, I know we've got a performance here, and this is a big deal.  Well, Robert's a rock god.  We've got to do this Norton thing.  Or the deal's off.  Or the deal is off. 
[01:04:30]  We came so close to the whole show being scrubbed.  A very upset Robert Plant leaving his band, sulking, moving away.  Management and label freaking out because of Norton.  So at the last minute, Robert said, well, we've got it.  And he agreed.  The picture was taken.  Yes.  It looks great.  And I understand Paul McCartney is stopping in at one point, possibly.  Well, you know, it's interesting.  We're talking to the McCartney people, and one of the conditions is a photo with you.  Right.  It's an attorney.  You better be there for that one.  Okay.  You know, that's actually critical to any of you. 
[01:05:00]  All the artists are coming to us now that we're big and popular and getting bigger all the time.  It's interesting how the Norton factor is a key ingredient.  Now a negotiation, Floyd.  I hear Jimmy is demanding that they find a crosswalk to take the McCartney picture.  Is that true?  And you're making him take his shoes off.  I don't want to be a pain in the ass, but Paul, take your shoes off.  Walk with me out to this crosswalk.  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  Wonderful.  In fact, I understand they might watch you on the cover of the next Plant Records.  Oh.  Be happy to be a part of that?  Nude crawling on rocks.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Hey, this is Ozzy Osbourne.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony.  Stay fucking tuned.  Because I'll come and fucking kill your baby bed.  Ah, it's the Opie and Anthony program. 
[01:06:00]  Did you hear that at all?  What?  In your headphones, the Ozzy?  Yeah.  I heard it so far in the background, and it sounded like it was in a tunnel and underwater  and so low that it was ridiculous. 
[01:06:30]  Well, they're working on things.  Yeah, I know.  I just want to...  I'm just saying this to tell them so they know what to look for.  Okay.  That's all.  That's all.  Well, they spent two weeks tweaking the studio, and now they're going to have to fine-tune  it.  That's all.  Yeah.  Eric?  And the only reason I'm not losing my mind, because where I sit, everything sounds really  good.  Sounds fine.  Well, they knew who to fix first, that's for sure.  Because I haven't started smoking that pot yet.  Harrison thought we came back from vacation and Opie's stuff wasn't fixed.  At least they know they don't have to fix other things that you break during the interim 
[01:07:00]  of being pissed because things weren't fixed.  They know I'm not going to break anything.  I'll lose my mind, but I won't break anything.  By the way, you do realize that I know I'm an idiot, right?  And an asshole, and that's why I'm starting to think that I'm going to start smoking pot  again.  Smoking the weed?  Yeah.  I need to mellow out.  Now, you talk about this.  I need to mellow out, and I need to start enjoying myself.  Do you think that's a good idea?  And enjoying my life.  Do you think life enjoyment is based on smoking pot?  I remember when I used to smoke pot.  It seemed to do me okay. 
[01:07:30]  The glass of wine doesn't hook you up?  Nah.  No?  Nah.  I've got to go on to heavier stuff.  You need heavier stepping stones.  Yeah.  So you're thinking of smoking the pot again.  Yeah.  If I'm going to go to rehab someday, it's not going to be over to wine like Billy Joel.  Billy Joel.  Jesus.  What a dopey thing to go to rehab for.  Dude, you know what?  If it ever gets to the point where I have to go to rehab, oh, I'm going to come up with  some stuff for the press.  Something good.  Something nuclear.  Yeah.  I was addicted to crystal meth and heroin cocktails.  Yeah.  I'm going to make it sound great. 
[01:08:00]  I'm reading the papers today.  Billy Joel got out of rehab again.  Yeah.  I couldn't shake the Chardonnay.  So for all you people living on Long Island, you might want to build fences around your houses.  Yeah.  He's back.  Because he's back.  Ready to rock and roll again right into your house.  Ah, there you go.  See?  Even his songs include wine.  Yeah.  Well, you admit it in the paper.  Where's my stuff today?  Bear with me. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  How about all three of them, Billy?  Sure.  While you're driving around Long Island.  Yeah.  Crashing into some old lady's house.  That is one of the best stories ever.  There goes Billy.  Ooh.  A bottle of red. 
[01:09:00]  A bottle of white.  It all depends upon your appetite.  I'll meet you anytime you want.  Through the wall of my Italian.  I'll meet you at an Italian restaurant if you can get there. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah, but in the paper today, it says he'll stick to women and songs.  A just rehabbed Billy Joel got a welcome home smooch from his wife, Kate Lee, in New York.  Sunday, he left the Betty Ford Center where the piano man said he beat his weakness for wine.  Things are okay with me these days. 
[01:10:00]  I've got a good job.  I've got a good office.  I've got a new wife.  I've got a new life.  And the family is fine.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's on the road.  It's on the way.  It's on the road.  You get all look so nice.  I've got so much time.  You can have a new life.  Hang in.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Ow, ow, ow, ow.  Stop, oh, stop.  Ow, ow, ow. 
[01:10:30]  I can't breathe.  Stop.  Oh, oh, oh.  Hot lights  My sweet romantic  Today's night  It's Martini Steve  It kind of worked though  I pushed the wrong button  That did work  It did  That's great  That ends that bit unfortunately  Alright well we were blowing until I fucked up 
[01:11:00]  No that's actually funny  Martini Steve  Yeah his little wine addiction  Yeah he's married to like a 23 year old  Or something crazy like that  Of course  How bad can your life be  If you're like pushing 60  And you're married to a 20 something year old  Yeah it's nice  Wake the fuck up Billy  He's definitely taking on an Uncle Fester look though  Isn't he  It's getting pretty creepy  By the way a really really really nice guy 
[01:11:30]  Oh sorry  Really  Yeah extremely nice  Let me guess when you met him  Could it have been at BAB  At BAB  Charity begins at home  Charity begins at home  Bob Buckman with Billy Joel here  Yeah well  Yeah  So he's out of rehab today  That's one of the big stories  Yes Jimmy  Dude I think that she's just married to him  Because he's Billy Joel  Yeah  Wow  You're going out on a limb there Jimmy  I'm just telling you  I'm just telling you  Alright where do you want to go next here  We've got so much to do 
[01:12:00]  Well I was quickly wondering  About the pot thing  Oh yeah yeah yeah  You want to start smoking pot  Maybe I've started  And well that's what I want to get into  You do seem high  Some of the shit you're coming out with  Maybe it's begun  Maybe it has begun huh  Do you  Do you have contact with anybody  That gets high these days  I have no clue  Not really no  Except for our dopey listeners  That like to hand it to you  Yeah 
[01:12:30]  Remember that time in Boston  Holy ass  When we're talking  Well we were doing a St. Paddy's broadcast  In Boston  When we were working for WAF  And Anthony and I  Especially back then  Gave the appearance  That we were druggies  Did we  I don't know  Just because of the type of radio  We were doing  And we were cranking out the tunes  You know something  We didn't try  We didn't go out there  And say yeah  We're going to smoke some weed  And stuff  People assume that we did  Because of the  Yeah the music  And the lifestyle  Yeah  That we were leading 
[01:13:00]  That we did  That we smoked pot  Or did coke or something  But we didn't  But the reality is  We've been drug free  Drug free  Sound like Voss now  I've been drug free  But shut up stupid  He's still getting that cheap applause  He was on Dennis Miller  The other night  And he's like  I've been drug free  Oh stop  And then the applause  Because one person  I want to see  With a heroin needle  Sticking out of his arm  Dead on the floor  Is Voss  Did he really say that  On Dennis Miller  Oh yeah  He was on Dennis Miller  And I saw it  He killed  He really did  Yeah  But he went for the applause break 
[01:13:30]  Or Dennis Miller  Set him up  Because you know  They do that cute  Pre-interview crap  And Voss goes  I've been drug free  Now for 19 years  19 years  Oh thank you  Thank you  Stop acting like  You beat the odds  Stupid  Everyone in entertainment  Is either sober or dead  Exactly  You're not a conquering hero  Moron  So we're doing this broadcast  For St. Paddy's Day  From this bar  Hold that up to your ear  Banana food 
[01:14:00]  I don't know  Sorry  A little visual for us  Things seem a lot  Funnier to me these days  Yeah  Sure  A little high  So yeah  We're doing this broadcast  Right  And this kid comes up  To me  At the bar  And he's like  I'm a big fan  And he holds out his hand  Yeah  Shake hands right  Shake hands  I was coming back  To the bathroom  Matter of fact  So I grab his hand 
[01:14:30]  Like we do  And in his hand  Is just a massive amount  Of  Yeah  He had some bud  Some bud  Yeah  It was all  You know  Put together  Very nicely  Yes  But there was some loose  Pot as well  Oh it wasn't in a bag  Or anything  No that's what I mean  He just had pot in his hand  And slaps it into Opie's palm  Slap like hey  You know  You guys are  You know  Kick ass  Handshake  Pushes it into your hand  And now I have it in my hand  And there were other people

[01:16:00]  Maybe roll it in a napkin  Napkin  And pass it off to Ozone  Or some of the other guys  Around the station  That were known for smoking the pot  Sure  Because I wasn't going to  At this point  I wasn't going to waste it  I'm like alright  I got out of that situation  It's still in my hand  I'll roll it up into something  And just pass it on to somebody  That's what  That's what I was thinking  So I get back to the bar  And Anthony's there  I'm about to tell him  What just happened  When Anthony turns around  And says  Opie I'd like to introduce you  To a couple of  Massachusetts finest 
[01:16:30]  State troopers  It's a good thing  I gave you the heads up  Right away  Because that was the first thing  I said to you  When you came back  And I didn't even know  You had pot  Thank God  Yeah  Because you know  We're blabber mouths  I would have openly told you  What happened  You know  Hey dude  Look at the pot I got  Right  And at that point  You know  They're huge fans of the show  But they have to do something  You never know  For the most part  They might have just said  Hey dude  Put that away  Right  But you never know  There could be that one cop  That goes  So now the troopers

But I fucking can't cause I don't have the disclaimer paperwork to fill out you fuckers  I'd like to throw a big fuck you out to Steve and his ability to have a store ready to inventory 
[01:21:30]  He's a big fucker  Call the Opie and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU line 1-866-FU line 1-866-FU line 1  Well fuck you very much  Opie and Anthony  XM202  Let us just look at you by the end of the way  No more moving like behind the shadow  Let us just look at you by the end of the way 
[01:22:00]  No more moving like behind the shadow  Ah, we're having a lot of fun today  That's right  Damn it  I hate these type of shows though  Which one's open?  There's so much going on that you don't really know where to go  I mean, do we talk about Britney Spears being pregnant? 
[01:22:30]  Britney  It's on the front page of the post, it's got to be important today  Well, her belly, they're showing the belly now  Front page of the post has her  Where is that?  At the beach?  Yeah  And she's kind of got her arms up in the air  Her hair is blowing  She's wearing like a bikini top and little shorts  And her belly is very pregnant  Yeah  Find that hot, Opie?  I know you got something  Pregnant chicks  She needs to be more pregnant 
[01:23:00]  More pregnant  Well  Yeah, the boobs have to swell up a little bit more  And the belly has to get a little bigger  They were saying all the little hints that they've had over the past  After the second trimester  Yeah  Yeah  That's when it's hot  All right, we talked about Britney Spears  All right  When you're banging her, you can poke the fetus's head like Mars  The only thing I like about a pregnant girl is that she could possibly put your mouth by her nipple  And hold your head and make you suckle  Really?  And make you feel like a little infant? 
[01:23:30]  I'm not an adult baby  I just think that there'd be something hot about  That fetish is just beyond any realm of reality  We had an adult baby on the old show  And a dominatrix  Spike  Spike did some great stuff for the radio show back in the day  And we had a falling out, unfortunately  I don't even know what it was about  But she did some great stuff for us  Spike was a she?  Yeah, Spike was very cool  A dom?  Yeah  She brought in all sorts of freaks for us 
[01:24:00]  I remember negotiating with Spike beforehand  Going, look, this is a very serious thing  I'm going to bring in an adult baby  But you guys, you know  You've got to kind of handle yourselves  And maybe have a sort of quote  A normal interview  Meaning trying to get into the lifestyle  And why people would do this, right?  And we're like  And for once, we're like  You know what?  Because the guy at the time  He just won't do it if he knows you guys are going to goof on him, right?  Right 
[01:24:30]  And so Anthony and I sacrificed  We're like, yeah, sure  We'll play it, you know, cool  Or as cool as we can  So she comes in with the dude  I'm laughing, just thinking about it  Oh my god  And he is a big fat guy  He's a fat guy that you would see  Just as a, like, around the office  Kind of looking guy  Sure, sure  You could see him in a suit and tie  Easily  The fat guy around the cubicles  Didn't he come in at, you know what?  He came in in a suit  He did come in with a suit  And then went to change 
[01:25:00]  Went to change  Because I think he wanted to, like  He came in  He wanted to feel out the atmosphere  Like, okay  Alright, alright  I think I can do this here  We had to bite our lips  Not to make fun of this guy  Because we were like  Yes, very serious  Of course, it's what you're into  No, no, no problem  Just to make him feel good about himself  So he'd put the diapers on  So then we go  Dude, this is our jobs  It's amazing  So we, uh  Exactly  So, uh 
[01:25:30]  We take a commercial break  And we do the big introduction  Door opens  The guy comes in  Just wearing a diaper  Yeah  Anthony and I  Just burst out  We couldn't contain it  The guy was wearing diapers  He was wearing, like, diapers  With the  Old school  Like, frilly thing around the legs  Old school diapers  Yeah  And he had, like, a bib thing  And that little hat  That little ties around your chin 
[01:26:00]  Baby hat  Baby hat  And this isn't, like, Halloween dress up  Costume thing  This guy was serious  He was deadly serious about this stuff  Oh, what an ass  He walked in  Big fat guy  With, uh, diapers  And the hat thing  You laughed at him?  Oh, we couldn't  Openly  And it wasn't  I tried out  Yeah, we weren't  For once  We were not trying to be dicks  Because we understood  That this would just be cool radio, right? 
[01:26:30]  But as soon as he walked in  Lost it  Just thinking about it  I gotta laugh again  I tried not looking at Opie  He tried not looking at me  Because we knew  We knew it was all over  If we even glanced at each other  Peripheral vision of each other  Because we were gonna lose it  And he walked in  And it was just all over  And then Spike started giving him  Mothering him  Yeah  She took her shirt off  Yeah  She had a big set of tits  She had huge  Natural heavy boobs  And the guy  It wasn't even a suckling thing 
[01:27:00]  The guy just cuddled  He, like, kind of got into the fetal position a little bit  And if you need a reference to what that position is  Just look over to the shelf over there  Goddamn thing  And she would cradle him  And he put his head against her breast  And would just start going  Making baby sounds  I have never wanted to just shoot somebody  Or beat them with a bat  So much in my life  You know how that fetish should end 
[01:27:30]  She shakes him until he dies  It was horrific  Yeah, looking at it was just  Our jaws dropped  We couldn't believe what we were singing  Why don't we  Can we please get a dom in here  To do some of that stuff  Wouldn't that be fantastic  That's not hardcore sex at all  It's not at all, really  Just  The hardest part is  Finding a guy  That's into this  You can't get a guy that goes  Dude, I'll do it  You know, you need somebody that is into this  And really, you know 
[01:28:00]  Lives this lifestyle  To come in  And, you know  Expose himself  Open himself up  To the ridicule  Eric is searching  Foundrymusic.com  Because we took pictures that day  Oh, there are plenty of pictures  But I don't know  It's going to take forever  Because this is really, really old school  Well, if there are pictures  I'm sure they'll be up on Foundry  At some point  I know I would love a reference picture  To look at now  The image I have in my head  It was definitely  A baby Huey thing  We were calling him  Baby Huey  Nah, that's  What is that?  Jimmy's head on a baby body? 
[01:28:30]  Yeah  Very confusing  I used to have this thing  With this girl we would talk  If anyone has the picture  You've got to send it in immediately  How could they do that?  Through Instant Feedback?  Could they send a link  Or something?  They could send a link  Through Instant Feedback  Yeah, let's try  Because, I mean  If we find the picture  Jimmy will lose it  For like five straight minutes  Yeah, that's a good one  There's something sexy about  Like, I'm not an adult baby  But I remember  I wanted this one girl  I wanted her just to  Suck her nipples  While she was knocked up  And then we used to talk about 
[01:29:00]  I was going to lay there  On the couch  And she was just going to  Jack me  Oh, thank you  Yeah, just like a good mommy would  You sicko  There are people that are into  Like the baby thing  Is one whole  Freak show  But there are people  That are into the lactating  Moms and stuff like that  And they enjoy  Yeah, suckling  That sweet sugary milk  Who knows what it tastes like  Yeah, exactly, Jimmy  Who the hell knows  I've read enough about it  I got nothing  No, you're lying now 
[01:29:30]  Remember the contest we had?  You took a taste somewhere  I'd love to tell you that I did  I didn't  All right  Remember the contest we had  With the lactating girls  Who could shoot the furthest?  Yeah  What a couple of asses we are  We had pregnant women come in  And have a squirt off  And we measured  To see how far they could lactate  Oh, these women were so proud  Oh, they were really proud  And I couldn't  I couldn't stay in the room  Like I had to hide  Because I was so petrified  Of one little droplet  One little spray droplet  Getting even close to me  You wouldn't suck that warm 
[01:30:00]  The warm, sugary treat  From those fatty glands  That's enough  That's enough  Oh, my God  No  It was hilarious  It fills your mouth  You gotta swallow  Anyway  It's always like one of those gags  On the sitcoms  Where they have the pregnant woman  And she puts the milk in the fridge  You know  They take it out  And put it in the fridge  To feed the kid later  And one of the sitcom people  Goes, oh, milk  And drinks it  Makes me gag 
[01:30:30]  Yeah  That's terrific  That's terrific  That's terrific  That's terrific  And  Horrible  You know  It's supposed to be very sweet, though  Because babies like sweet things  Really?  Alright, well  Huffing your nipples, didn't it?  Alright, go to Instant Feedback  Someone  I know someone out there  One of our  Hardcore listeners  Has the pictures  You've got to send it in  Are you an adult baby?  Anyway  We should say again 
[01:31:00]  To the perv story  Oh, god damn  I'm fascinated  With pervs  I've got to tell you  Well, who is it, Opie?  Because there's something  That just goes on  In their heads  Look  It's nothing different  Than what goes on  In most normal people's heads  These perverts  These freaks  You read about them  All the time  The dentist  That fills up the woman  The dentist  Story we had  About a month ago  Oh, my god  The doctor  That just  You know 
[01:31:30]  Is examining a woman  And he's  You know  Not even  A guy  That should be  Given breast exams  But  You know  He's grabbing her boobs  He's grabbing crotch  He's getting her naked  He's  You know  The dentist  Puts the woman  Under anesthesia  And she wakes up  And she's a little askew  She's feeling dirty  For some reason  Her clothes are a little  Her clothes are a little off  You know  Because when you  When you violate a woman  When she's under  Uh-huh  Laughing gas  You know  You're something  Expert 
[01:32:00]  No  You still have to  Put her back together  You've got to put her clothes back on  You just don't do it quite right  Do you know something  I don't think a lot of guys know  Women adjust themselves in bras  And they know where their boobs are  Sure  In those bras at all times  You ever  You ever sleep  Maybe in your underwear  And you wake up  And maybe you were rolling around  And your underwear  Are twisted around sideways  Could you imagine  Like waking up in the dentist chair  And all of a sudden  Your underwear are like that  You would know  There was some shenanigans  Going on  You know  Do you call it shenanigans  A little hanky-panky perhaps 
[01:32:30]  But you would know  Something happened  I'm sure women  Wake up and go  My boobs just don't feel right  In the bra  Like the nipple isn't  Pulled up enough  They're a little bent in there  Or something  You know  They smell like the  Dried saliva smell you get  When you lick something  You know that awful smell  Of dried saliva on skin  But the fascination I have  With these people  Like the dentist story  All of a sudden  Everything is normal  Everything's fine  The teeth cleaning is going on 
[01:33:00]  And what have you  He's a dentist  He's a dentist  He's doing an examination  And all of a sudden  A switch goes off in his head  And he just loses his mind  For a few seconds  And then his whole career  Is fucked  Just gone  Gone in a flash  Because the switch  Just goes off in his head  Well like any normal person  You walk the streets  You're at your job  Just like the dentist  Or something  You look at an attractive woman  And go  Wow  I would love to see those breasts  Or  What a great ass on that girl 
[01:33:30]  I wonder  I wonder what it looks like  If her pants are pulled down  You know  A thong or something  Most people just think that  This guy is thinking that  She's laying in the chair maybe  He's looking  And then he's like  Yeah well  Alright  She needs a filling  I think this bicuspid's a little  I gotta feel those tits  I gotta feel the tits  And then he does  A little  You know  I hope I gave her enough Novocaine  Yeah there's a  I'm seeing a little darkness  On that back molar 
[01:34:00]  I got snatch  I'm gonna squeeze her snatch  I gotta feel this snatch  They just lose their minds  You women don't even know  What you do to guys  And these pervs  That's what happens  And we have the latest guy  Yeah  An old timer  An old timer  Oldie timer  They're seeing women  Passed out too  All the time  Which has got to be hard  Right  You're a doctor  And they're just laying  With their legs open  And a little  How do you not touch 
[01:34:30]  The women  Is that a pervert I'm saying  I don't know  Laying in that dentist chair  They got the little thing  Maybe the gas is going in  Their mouth is open  A little bit  Cleavage perhaps  You're seeing a little bit  You're working on the mouth  You know  The mouth is very  Sensuous  It's very sexy  And you're working  On that mouth  Not when you're digging  Plac out of it  It's not  Well you know  I'm not talking about  A placard in mouth  Perhaps it's just  Maybe the girl  Needs her braces 
[01:35:00]  Taken off  Jesus  Or maybe  Or maybe the tooth fairy came  All right  Jesus Jimmy  You know  And the breasts  Are right there  So you're working  And you know  Okay let's look at this  I'll check the x-ray  Because I think I saw  A spot on that  I gotta feel up  These tits  God damn it  What nice tits  You know  You just lose your mind  Thank you for helping me out  Because yeah  The switch just goes off 
[01:35:30]  Click  You know  Yeah  It's not on a dimmer  No  We all have dimmers  Like you  You think it  But you're able to  You know  Before you get that dimmer  All the way up  And you're gonna do something crazy  You bring it back down  Enough time goes by  While the dimmer's going up  For you to realize  Oh my god  I'm gonna jeopardize my job  Right  You're in the dentist  You're working on her tooth  Maybe you're taking that  Sharp little pick thing  And you're picking at something  And then you look and go  God this girl's got  An attractive set of  Kids on her down there  All right  I'll scrape here 
[01:36:00]  I'll do this  You know  You think that  The dimmer went up a little  But you realize  I'm gonna slide this down  What a nice body on this girl  My god  I wonder if she's single  Or married  All right  I'll check this molar  But anyway  All right  Back to my job  Okay  Let me get the x-rays  You know  It's not  You know  I'll go and think  You know  I believe  If we take another x-ray  Holy shit  Kids  I'm grabbing them  You can't  You can't just flip the pervert switch 
[01:36:30]  These guys in that second  Just completely jeopardize  Their job is gone  You gotta have some kind of gray area  That common sense can delve into  And maybe talk you down  Don't do that  This can be the biggest laugh  I've had on the show  Oh my god  It's the biggest laugh  Nice skin  Oh my god  I think her button was  Opened on  I could see down her  Better not look 
[01:37:00]  Unprofessional  All right  This is the dimmer right  That we all have  Talks it down  Okay  You're able to  Common sense  Talk yourself down  As opposed to  You know  She does have a little  Flash on there  I can  Clamp  Down  Make sure this equipment  Is  My god  These nipples  I have to suck them  I gotta suck her tits  Ding  Job over  Career over  In jail  Worked your whole life  To get the nice 
[01:37:30]  Cushy dentist job  Yeah  And that stupid  Oh all your years  And years of school  You're in class  You're studying  You're in your dorm  You're taking tests  You go through college  Now you gotta go through  Medical school  You go through dental school  Years and years  And that's why  Most of the guys  Never do it  Because they start  Thinking about all that stuff  Like oh my god  I got  Know how long it took me  To get to this point  Of course I can't  Squeeze these tits  Yeah you go  If I was insane  I would just grab  This girl's tits  But gee  You think back  Have that quick flashback 
[01:38:00]  To you studying in school  Endless nights  Of cramming for exams  And you think  I'm not gonna give this up  Just to grab those  Of course they're attractive  But could you  Give me the x-ray  Of this lovely young lady  Here  You know  You gotta  Flip that  Turn that dimmer  Back down  But is it  Is it being a pervert  Though if all those years  How many of us  Would be strong enough  To not  I'm sure that the dimmer  Gets switched a little  Higher each time  Like maybe one time  You think  You lie to yourself 
[01:38:30]  Like as you're  Grabbing for something  You allow your hand  To brush her breast  And that's all you do  And you tell yourself  You didn't mean it  But every time  It becomes a little bit more  And teeny bit more  The dimmer might move slowly  Over the years  Do you think  Maybe some of these guys  Do that  One time you have  A half of heart on  You push it against her hand  While she's out  Real quick  And that's it  No  I think common sense  And any normal dentist  99% of dentists surveyed  They wouldn't do anything  Even remotely close 
[01:39:00]  You're probably right  But hey look  Passed out girl man  With you know  Yeah  It's gotta be hard  Well anyway  We have another perv  That was busted  Another pervert  Now look  You know  These perverts  These older perverts  I understand the seriousness  Of all this stuff  Yeah  Trust me  But I mean  I also see the silliness  Of it as well  I love how this guy  Screamed out  When he got arrested too  Oh I didn't read that part  He put on a little  Put up a little fight  And he gets arrested  And screams out  You're going to ruin my life  He knew it 
[01:39:30]  Hey at least he knew  It was coming  He knew  He was addicted  To being a perv  I guess  Yep  So it's this guy  Who's on one of the subways  Here in New York City  And the article reads  Sleazy geezer  Cops lead  William whatever  72 from the Union Square  Subway precinct  Yesterday  After an undercover  Officer spotted him  Allegedly  Pushing against  School girls  On a train  Oh  Yeah  Not cool obviously  But the whole switch thing  In the head 
[01:40:00]  That's what I find silly  You know  Yeah  He's probably sitting  On the subway  And all is good  With the world  Maybe it's crowded  They're all standing up  And these school girls  Come in  And they're wearing skirts  They're in their little  School girl uniforms  And looking kind of hot  And he's just standing there  And normal people  I know myself  If I was in there  I would take a look  Probably even out of the  Corner of my eye  So as not to look like  A gawking pervert  You know  Maybe I'm looking 
[01:40:30]  I'm looking at the  The billboards  That are up in the train  Or I'm looking out the window  Hey what station  Are we going to  But meanwhile  I'm just kind of looking  Going  My god  That girl's got  Some set of pins  Peeking out of her skirt  Or ooh  She has her shirt  Unbuttoned a little low  For a little school girl  Doesn't she  For an eighth grader  Or whatever these girls  Were on the train  Sixth graders  And then you're like  And then you're thinking  These crazy things  Thank god no one else 
[01:41:00]  Could read my mind  Right right yeah  Thank god there's no  Mind readers here  Just between me and my  Subconscious  Yeah  Just standing here  Like wow  That's some crazy thoughts  I just had  Ooh  Thank god my stop is next  But you get an old  Geezer pervert  He's got to stand there  I really got to start  Reading these articles  Before we go on the air  Because there's a lot  Of funny things  Oh I know  Yeah I kind of  Read through that one  So the guy  He's on the  The sixth train  And all of a sudden  He decided  He needed to 
[01:41:30]  Stand extremely close  To a group of girls  Yeah  From the nearby  Middle school  Look I know it's  You know whatever  But  But I'm just  I'm just thinking  This in my head  Oh yeah  This is a good one  Risky business right  Love on a train  Anyway  Tangerine dream by the way  Thank you  Thank you  Oh was that it  Yes  Yeah so all of a sudden  He  The switch goes off  In his head  And he has to stand 
[01:42:00]  Extremely close to the girls  He just loses his mind  In that split second  And then  One of the officers  Is quoted here  Saying there was  More than enough room  For him to stand  Away from them  Oh so then  It must have been  Really creepy  It wasn't even like  A crowded train  Right  Where you're kind of  Brushing up against people  Where you could get  A good lawyer  And he would be like  Look man  It was a crowded train  And there was some kind of  You know  An abrupt stop  And he bumped into her  It's bouncing  The train's bouncing  Of course  No lawyers taking this case 
[01:42:30]  It was him and three girls  On one car  On the train car  And he's right next to them  Yeah  Or creepy  There was more than enough room  For him to stand away from them  But  He started pushing up  Against them  Bumping and grinding  He lost it  He lost it  The perg switch  Went off in his head  He's looking at the girls  On the train  Oh a trick of a girl  And then he had to just 
[01:43:00]  Cock on the leg  Right  I gotta put my cock  On her leg  You know  It's old man  Can't retain himself  Old man  Crotch just like this  Pushing forward  That old man's scent  Coming off his skin  And by the way  This guy  This is why these guys  Should be executed  He was arrested in 1989  For molesting  Eight 11 year olds  Eight 11 year olds  So the switch didn't just go off  His switch has been on  He probably just has to dim it down  So he doesn't get arrested all the time  This guy's a predator  Eight 11 year olds 
[01:43:30]  Jesus  Yeah  I mean it's awful  I don't even know why he's  Where do you get access to these youngsters  Allowed to be on the subway  But as the train approached  77th street  You can't ban someone from the subway  No I mean  Well I mean  That was an old man thing to say  Why is he allowed on the train  That's Jimmy Shakespeare's fist  Yeah  Alright you're right  Why you kids  They ought to ban him from the subway  I'm thinking maybe he should have done jail time  So then he wouldn't be on the subway  That's what I meant to say 
[01:44:00]  Along with the colored  Have you been on the subway lately  No  Guess who the minority is  Whitey  Whitey  Really  Oh my god  Yeah  As the train approached 77th street  And the girls prepared to exit  This guy grabbed at least one of the girls  Between her legs  He just couldn't  He just lost his effing mind  Knowing that he would be in deep trouble  Especially with this 1989 thing  That he has  Sometimes you just gotta grab it  Probably saw a nice puffy one  Right  Right Jimmy 
[01:44:30]  Yeah  Well not someone that young  Would gross  That would do nothing  And he had to  But a puffy one on an adult  And then of course  Listen to you  His mouth protest is too much  Huh  You're kind of like  Well yeah  On an older one I would  Well only because you're using me  As a reference point  And I know I'm such a scumbag  I had to clarify that  You know what  I wasn't even talking about  The age of the girl  I was just talking about  It's a nice one  And you gotta grab it  But no  Not a young one though  I have to be careful  Because when I'm being used  As a reference point  I kind of have to 
[01:45:00]  Put the asterisk  Like I really  I don't go for that  But only the of age women  That's right  I check ID  Before I grab a twat and kick her  Yeah  Well  But the perv was probably  Just sitting there  And all of a sudden  Just gets up and just starts  Slowly making his way  Over to the girls  And then the switch goes on  And then  Grab that snatch  Gotta grab a snatch  Do you think he pinched it  The way your uncle holds your face  Like when he put his thumb 
[01:45:30]  On one cheek  And his other  Come here  Come here boobie  Come here boobie  You just grab it like that  Did she go  Oh  A little air pry came out  Oh gosh  They talked to a few of the girls  In that article  And I know one of them said that  And she was an 8th grader  And said that  A lot of times  They're on the train  And guys are always  Touching them  And she has to turn around  Many times  And say  Excuse me  Watch your hands 
[01:46:00]  Or take your hands off me  I mean at this point  I don't want to be a buzzkill  For everybody out there  But they really need  To get rid of the  Catholic schoolgirl's skirts  Well  Slow down now  Don't  I know the school administrators  Think it's a good idea  To have a uniform  But  Who does think  That's a great idea  I mean  Look  I love seeing it  Like the next guy  But  Who is in charge  And thinking this through  And here's what  The girls are doing too  Because I lived in Brooklyn  And there's plenty of 
[01:46:30]  These Catholic schoolgirls  Where they're tying up  Dude  Because they still want to look hot  For  You know  They take the white shirt  For potential boyfriends  That are their age  Go ahead sir  Untuck it from the skirt  They unbutton  The first few buttons  Down at the bottom of the shirt  And tie it in a knot  So now it's a belly shirt  Their whole midriff is exposed  Then they take the skirt  And roll it  Up at the waistband  So it gets shorter  Shorter  Shorter  So now they've got  This rolled skirt  Around their waist 
[01:47:00]  And then they pull them down  So their thong is showing  Out the back  The shirt is tied up  To the bottom of their tits  And their skirts are now  Mini skirts  They're really short  And they walk around like this  And it's a Catholic school  Little outfit  It's ridiculous  You've got to have an outfit  That's not sexy for school  For kids  For teenage girls  But somewhere  This started  Someone said  This is a good idea  Well most of them  They were a lot longer  In the older days  They were long skirts 
[01:47:30]  Somehow they pushed it up  Who was the administrator  That said  We need to make these shorter  And how did they get that through  You know  Someone had to make them shorter  And then Britney Spears  Makes that video  That one of the first ones  She did  Where she made it  Beyond cool  To have the Catholic schoolgirl  Skirt on  And she in the video  Was tying it  You know  Tying the shirt  That's what they do  And a lot of that  Japanime porn  You ever see some of that stuff  Oh my god  It's all 
[01:48:00]  Catholic  Little young  Schoolgirls  In those outfits  Getting banged  By these  Big  Older  Asian  Cartoon characters  I just hate Japanimation  Yeah  They just sit there  And yell  Scream  As these big  Large  Glowing  Cocks  Are going into them  And they pull out  And it's  All over  Oh yeah  It's strangely erotic  Strangely erotic  Alright  So there you go  That's the latest  On the perv thing  But the perv switch  That's  That's one of the funniest 
[01:48:30]  Things I've heard  On this new show bro  You just gotta  You can control yourself  Please try to control yourself  I remember one time  I didn't do anything like this  But I was giving a woman a ride  And we decided to pull over  And she wanted me to buy her beer  I said okay  I was probably 19 at the time  How old was she?  In her thirties  Older  She wanted you to buy her beer?  Like she'd have me money  Oh okay  I might have been 22  Oh yeah  No no no  It was a monetary 
[01:49:00]  Oh boy I'm glad I cleared that up  Yeah I know  I didn't want to buy her beer  What?  And she's married  Or whatever she's telling me  So we pull over to talk  And I'm trying to get her  To fool around with me  And I gotta ride  And she's just  She won't do anything  She says no I can't  I got a boyfriend  But then she just  She rubs the front of my pants  Real quick  And she goes oh  Like she was tempted  And the lust that ran through me  I definitely understood at that moment  How someone could just attack a girl  You were ready to 
[01:49:30]  Dude it was  It was the purest lust I've ever felt  Because from her it was real  So I dropped her off  I got her the beer  I just  I mean I'm not a  Creep  So I dropped her off  And I'm driving  And I'm so turned on  I start jacking off  While I'm driving  And I couldn't  I'd never  I'm driving down  It was in North Brunswick  It was  I forget the name of the street  But I'm driving  And I'm jerking off  And then I saw my friend Dean walking  So I put my mule away real quick  And pulled over  And talked to him  But that was  I was  Yeah but I mean 
[01:50:00]  I understood at that moment  That's how those things happen  You get so hit  With that lust  You can't  You can't do anything about it  Knowing you  I'm surprised you didn't say  Do you mind if I just  You know  Take this out then  And take care of myself  With you in the car  Believe me right now  That's exactly what I do  But I was younger  Back to you  You're an M.O.  Well  The point I want to make here  Is everyone has that perv switch  Yeah  But most people  Control it  Yeah  Yeah  You know  It's kept under control  Kept under control  I guess I did control it  Hey we got something that  I think 
[01:50:30]  Could be a huge laugh today  Yeah  Hope you're enjoying the show  Especially the new people out there  Yes  We haven't really acknowledged them yet  A lot of new folk  The Terry Schiavo  And the Pat O'Brien sex tapes  We had a lot of fun with the Pat O'Brien sex tapes  Just before we went on break  A couple new ones came in as we were on vacation  Right  And  I love this  How do we set this up? 
[01:51:00]  Well it's  Well it's the immigrant song Anthony  Yeah  Immigrant song  With the Pat O'Brien  And Terry Schiavo  Yeah  Now obviously  There's no surprise here  Like you know what's coming  But  It's just as funny as if it was a surprise  I'm sorry  When I heard this  I was laughing my balls off  And I knew exactly what was coming  So without further ado  Here it is  You are so fucking hot 
[01:51:30]  You are so fucking hot  I'm so fucking  Thank you  Thank you  The Pepsi's  No jealous  Boy  I'm so fucking  I'm so fucking  I'm so fucking  I'm so fucking  I'm so fucking  I'm so fucking

[01:54:30]  Check it out.  Electronic stores, including Best Buy and Circuit City.  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  Everybody's talking about the Opie and Anthony show.  We don't care.  Keep talking.  I know I'm a loser.  You're a jerk-off.  A douche.  You effing tall.  I'm a tool.  I'm a dumb plop. 
[01:55:00]  Okay, pathetic.  Did someone just shoot me in the head?  Back to you, Opie. 
[01:55:30]  Hey, everyone, it's your good pal, Phil McCracken.  Boy, I got a rock-hard one here in my back, because I'm diddling myself.  You're a kid-toucher.  I'll bag anything with a hole.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, let's go touch some children.  Okay, terrific, thank you.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Let's do it!  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:56:00]  All right.  Tracy Morgan, by the way, will be here today.  Yeah.  Should have been promoting that all morning, but we stink at promoting stuff.  Where's Elo?  We've got to thank him again.  What the hell's going on with this company all of a sudden?  I know. 
[01:56:30]  Good things are happening.  Is your mic on?  I love it.  I hope so.  Oh, okay.  Elo is in New York.  Stops by the New York facility from time to time.  Only when big things are going down.  That's what we think.  Yep.  I heard you guys went to dinner.  Yeah, we went to dinner last night.  I thank you for not phoning me.  It was hilarious because he calls me.  He's like, well, you know, I'm in New York.  And he's a lot of fun to do dinner with.  He's not a bore like most of these executives and stuff. 
[01:57:00]  But the last time we did dinner with Elo, if you're an older listener, Anthony lost his  mind because it took him like two hours to come back into the city from Long Island.  Yeah.  You know, the trip that we talk about from time to time that only takes about 20 minutes.  It's very time sensitive, the trip.  It could take 20 minutes.  It could take two hours.  Right.  Same trip.  Two hours.  And that's how long it took me to get from home back into the city the last time we had  dinner.  Two hours.  Two hours.  Because it's during the heat of rush hour to come back in and have dinner. 
[01:57:30]  And I vowed.  I said, I appreciate it.  Thank you, Elo.  But never, ever again will I come in and go to dinner.  So I appreciate the fact that you didn't call.  No, it wasn't even a call.  I did bring it up several times at dinner and I discussed how odd it felt not having  you there.  That's fine.  Feel out of the way.  Dude, you have a really good radio voice, by the way.  Thank you.  Did you ever do radio?  Yeah.  I did mornings and I was a horrible disc jockey, though.  Exactly right.  I had the inappropriate bell.  I had the horn. 
[01:58:00]  I was...  The Elo show.  I grew up really idolizing the real Don Steele and the whole boss jock and the Bill Lee  thing.  So did I.  I mean, to me, the whole boss...  I didn't get into the East Coast vibe as much, like the Cousin Brucey stuff.  I got into the West Coast vibe with KHJ and KFRC and stuff.  I didn't know there was an East Coast, West Coast thing.  There was.  See?  You should go to realradio.com and...  Into Charlie Tuna.  Charlie Tuna.  He was West Coast.  He was West Coast.  Charlie Tuna.  Yeah.  How long has Cousin Brucey done that echo? 
[01:58:30]  What's that?  How long has he done that echo?  Is that like a long time thing?  The reverb?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I did.  Forever.  I think it's actually...  He's got it implanted in his voice now.  Hello, love.  Rob Lundy.  Sing me out.  He's got a reverb box on his phone at his house when you call him.  Just so it has that sound.  That's great.  That everyone knows.  Well, I missed you last night and I ate a nice big char of meat for you.  Oh, nice.  It was great because he called me up.  He's like, you want to do dinner?  You know, might as well.  We're in town.  We can talk some things over.  Silly Elo.  Let's just stop right there.  Don't you recall last time? 
[01:59:00]  I do remember vividly.  And I wasn't even going to give you the call to tell you I was going to dinner with Elo.  I just knew the answer and I'm like, why bother?  Why waste time?  If I'm staying in town, I would be honored to go out to dinner.  Well, I was here yesterday.  I saw how your day started.  So I figured you were just looking forward to getting home.  Oh, that was pretty much it.  And my trip home, I got home and then I had to deal with the Escalade.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  I had to deal with that.  Have the service center come over. 
[01:59:30]  First, it was kind of something that seems very simple.  It's very confusing to some people.  We're talking about the dead battery, right?  Yeah, yeah.  My Escalade, for some reason, when it sat for more than a couple of days, go out, turn the key, nothing.  Not a click.  I mean, total dead.  Total dead.  Completely dead battery.  So that's what happened.  And I have to call the proper people to send over the service.  Because I got, you know, the OnStar, you just hit the button, and they come and get you.  Yeah, service, everything. 
[02:00:00]  The problem is, OnStar needs electricity.  I was going to say, how does that work with a dead battery?  Complete dead battery.  Well, I have a second vehicle that has OnStar.  So that's in the driveway.  So I go into that vehicle.  I hit the OnStar thing.  And now I'm trying to convey this very complicated situation that I'm not in the car that needs service.  That car is five feet away from this one.  The car I'm in is fine and does not need service.  The other one that is five feet away from me is the one that needs service. 
[02:00:30]  They could not quite grasp that whole thing.  They're asking if I'm okay, if I need a lift.  I go, no, I'm in my driveway.  I'm home.  I'm okay.  All right.  Well, your car needs service.  Yeah, but not this one.  Oh.  Well, no, we only send the service ones for the ones with the OnStar contract.  No, it has the OnStar contract.  It's another.  It's the other.  I'm looking at it. 
[02:01:00]  I'm looking at it.  So that took quite a while to kind of get them up to speed on that.  I had to give phone numbers and code names and numbers.  So there's little commercials where you hear the people calling in.  I don't know if yours is going to be.  Oh, they should, yeah.  They should play that one.  It's five feet away, you idiot.  An actual OnStar report.  Right, right.  Come on, you dope.  Could you give me the license plate of the vehicle?  Yes, I'm reading it.  It's right in front of me.  Help me.  Yeah, so they did the jump, and then I drove it to the service center. 
[02:01:30]  And then to try to get an answer out of how long it's going to take, I asked the guy straight out.  I go, any time frame on this?  Well, it's the battery and the electrical system.  Yeah.  He really, that should have, he looked at me like that should have satisfied me as to how long this should take.  It's the battery and the electrical system.  Oh, well, then, okay.  Then I'll see you at a quarter past the fuel gauge running low. 
[02:02:00]  Well, good.  I feel better now knowing I didn't call you now.  Yeah.  Well, thank you.  And again, thank you.  I was very busy.  Did they give you a rental car because it's a brand new truck?  No, they didn't give me a rental car.  I didn't ask for one because I had my other vehicle.  So I'm waiting.  And it should be ready by today, and hopefully.  All is well.  And I must say, I have had no other problems with this.  This was one problem in six months.  You don't want a six-month-old vehicle to have any problems.  I must say, my Mountaineer, I didn't have a problem. 
[02:02:30]  My Nissan Pathfinder, I didn't have a problem.  I love the GM products.  Don't get me wrong.  I love mine.  I love the fact that my XM satellite radio is built right in there, and it's beautiful.  The interface is fantastic.  I love the navigation system on the Escalade.  And when the one gets fixed in the SRX, I will love that, too, because there seems  to be a little problem with my navigation system and my SRX.  Is GM giving a discount to people who work for XM? 
[02:03:00]  You know, like a little wink-wink hookup, you know, and maybe we, not that it would be  payola, of course, but maybe we chit-chat about the product on the air a lot.  You should give me a call, Jimmy.  Maybe I can hook you up.  I kind of would like that.  The old Saturn is good, but, you know.  That thing's falling apart.  It's got 30,000 city miles on it.  Which is a lot of miles.  30,000?  That's like 300,000 normal miles.  Yes.  A lot of city miles.  So we have ELO.  30,000 hooker miles.  30,000 city miles.  Three blocks.  It's covered.  Why have you had your passenger window motor replaced three times? 
[02:03:30]  Why are there blonde wig hairs in the ceiling fiber?  Oh, God.  Hooker miles.  I love it.  That's great.  Well, yeah, so thank you for not rolling us. 
[02:04:00]  That was, as you can see, very busy.  The reason ELO is in the studio, Anthony.  Yeah.  XM is rocking and rolling.  Rocking and rolling.  Oh, yeah.  He handed us some ads.  Holy S.  I know.  Look at this.  My God, man.  You want to explain this ELO?  USA Today.  What's that?  Well, I was going to say, you want to explain this ELO?  It's very obvious here.  It's full-page ads in USA Today and a paper we don't read, the New York Times.  My God.  We would have found this ourselves if we read the paper. 
[02:04:30]  What paper is that?  The New York Times.  New York Times.  That's in New York?  It's a local paper.  Is that a local paper in New York?  I've never heard of it.  Once again, for the newbies, this is a newspaper that's one of those big papers that is...  I hate the big papers where it's...  You can't read it right.  It's that huge paper that you have to know how to fold to read.  Right, right.  There's a proper way to fold it.  And the only people that know that fold move are the businessmen on the train, like that  read it.  I can show you.  I can do that.  Oh, you can do it while you're the businessmen on the train.  Absolutely, right.  We do use the New York Times to cover up the windows so the faggots that we work with don't 
[02:05:00]  see any breasts.  Yeah, Paris would have thought they'd say a beautiful young woman.  Well, that's what I'm going to get.  Because, yeah, this came down from Washington.  Hey, any nudity in the studio, you've got to cover up all the windows.  And I'm thinking, but...  Hostile work environment.  But it's all guys here.  There's not one woman.  Why can't a guy be offended by a beautiful young woman?  Well, that's what I'm starting...  Good point, Ant.  That's what's saying.  That's what I'm learning.  That qualifies as hostile, Ant.  That's right.  That's what I'm learning.  So we read the New York Post, the Daily News, the Weekly World News, and the New York Times 
[02:05:30]  is reserved to tape up over the windows.  Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  But now you can tape up your ad.  Your full-page ad.  You can tape up your full-page ad.  It's a full-page ad for XM.  National USA Day.  It's also in the Washington Post and quite a few other papers, the LA Times.  It's very impressive.  That's great.  It's got our picture up there, along with...  Who else is in there?  Bob Edwards.  Bob Edwards, Snoop.  Snoop Dogg, and Cal Ripken, Jr.  Mm-hmm.  Good representation of what XM is doing these days. 
[02:06:00]  It's all about variety.  That's right.  It's all about variety.  And you know, I'll tell you, who really deserves credit for developing this ad is Hugh Pinero.  This was his idea.  His baby.  This is his baby.  Hugh said we should do this ad, and he built it himself.  Whose baby is that?  I'll buy that baby.  What's the Opie and Anthony ad say?  What do you mean?  I just thought that it might have some text or something.  You son of a bitch.  Why?  I haven't read it. 
[02:06:30]  I am wondering.  You've never satisfied Jimmy.  It's a huge ad.  It's a really bad picture, once again, of Anthony and I, because no one warns us when these pictures are going to be taken.  When we're at work, like halfway through the show, they go, hey, we're taking pictures for a national ad.  Right.  Oh, thanks.  I would have showered.  Showered would have been nice, sure.  Maybe a haircut.  But I like it better than the cartoon, though.  I've got to tell you.  I agree.  The cartoon, the cartoon, I'm a little over.  Yeah, enough with the two caricatures.  Down syndrome heads.  How about somebody?  By the way, you gave me such a complex with my hair, with my Down syndrome hair, I actually got a cut. 
[02:07:00]  You don't have Down syndrome heads.  That's what you said.  That's not true.  I didn't mean it when you're sitting right in front of me.  He's got a great head of hair on.  He certainly does.  I changed it.  All right.  It says, Opie and Anthony on High Voltage XM, Channel 202.  Everyone's favorite radio duo is back.  And now they're as outrageous as ever.  There you go.  Whack it.  Hit the bell.  Catch their daily show featuring...  Am I off?  Oh, you're on.  You're on.  It's good. 
[02:07:30]  I heard it good.  What's wrong?  I think my leg just hit something.  Wait a minute.  Let me try.  Can you fix your own problem for once?  Yeah, I think I did it.  Oh, very good.  That's a great place for my headphone volume, too, is right by my leg.  I've got to tell you what.  This is the first time I've seen this, though.  I mean, you said something's not working.  And we just had...  It was like I was like Elyon in a closet, and you got stormed from somewhere in Miami.  People were rushing in here.  People rushed over.  This is very impressive.  And it was nothing that complicated.  My leg hit the volume knob, which is right next to my kneecap. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah, this maybe should be moved in the future.  I'm impressed.  That's okay.  I'm impressed.  And that's pretty much all it says.  I think I didn't like the fact that my good friend, Ope, is reading something and everybody's  interrupting him.  Oh, I'm sorry.  There's really not much else in this, so we can move on.  The point is more to come.  Just want to make sure you guys saw it.  That's not the point.  The point is that this is a fine ad, and I commend that.  No, no, no.  You lie.  You're a liar.  I like this ad.  No, no, no.  Here's the real issue. 
[02:08:30]  The real issue is there's two things missing out of that ad, in your opinion.  The first letter starts with Jim, and the last letter starts with Norton.  Right, right.  No, not at all, actually.  Okay.  You know what?  We definitely should start including Jimmy in some of these things.  I totally agree.  I agree.  I'm not sure how, but I also think our pictures, we should have pictures taken with the three  of us so that when we sign stuff, it's not Jimmy signing over our faces, and at least  we can retaliate a little bit and sign over his. 
[02:09:00]  I actually don't mind the picture not being, what did the ad say?  That was actually, it was a very good one.  I'm not complaining.  I'm very happy with it.  All right.  Everyone's favorite radio duo is back, and now they're as outrageous as ever.  Catch their daily show featuring some hack comic and special guests from the world of  entertainment and sports only on XM.  Well, everyone knows who that is.  There you go.  Rich Voss.  I was very happy since I wrote that.  Catch their daily show featuring Jim Norton. 
[02:09:30]  There you go.  There you go.  And I was...  You're finally being included.  I was...  I don't need to be in the picture.  I don't actually mind signing the soundboard.  You guys are the franchise.  I get a bummer.  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Yeah, that's fine.  I sign the soundboard.  Or it really annoyed people.  I'll sign right over Ant's face and right over Ope's face.  Yeah, that's what he does.  That's what he did for most of the pictures we signed in Boston.  All right.  I got my tie on today.  I'm off doing more things.  All right.  I really fast want to show you this.  Another assault on the media happened.  Wait, where was that?  That was ESPN.  ESPN 2, outside Fenway as Yankee fans and Sox fans were going into the park for the big game. 
[02:10:00]  And I didn't notice this.  There's two guys with Wild stickers.  Right.  That got on TV for us last night.  This is up on Foundry Music.  That way I'm as well.  I took some of the trucker stickers home that you guys have here.  The big, giant Wild.  The big mofo ones.  I like those.  Yeah.  Those are great.  We've got to get those out.  Those are fantastic.  Not that you'd want to put them on your own car, of course.  But, you know, if they wind up on someone else's car or some other...  piece of public transportation, I certainly would giggle.  You know, it is great.  They are about the size of some of the ads you see on the sides or the backs of buses. 
[02:10:30]  City buses.  You can just cover them up.  So, when you slap them on the back of a city bus, you're pretty much getting free advertising.  And it looks like it was meant to be there.  Sure.  Sure.  Yeah.  I like that idea.  And you're making your pals happy.  Mm-hmm.  Let's say hi to Dragon Wagon.  Yeah, guys.  You...  Totally.  What?  What?  You broke up.  We can't hear you.  Totally offended me today.  You...  We totally...  You're talking...  I was an over-the-road truck driver, and this dude of these things that you're all talking  about is ridiculous.  What are you talking about? 
[02:11:00]  The what thing, sir?  Did you take in any histamine before you call next time, you clogged-nosed idiot?  It's...  It's...  You guys are disgusting.  I mean, you know, I turned it on.  I'm calling XM and complaining about this channel.  Oh.  Let's all of this do it.  Really?  Yeah.  What don't you like about the channel?  Well, you guys are...  Actually, it wouldn't be Howard Stern.  I mean, you know, it's decent.  It's immoral, what you're talking about.  You know what you should do, sir? 
[02:11:30]  Before you...  Right after you call XM, you should drink a fifth of Old Grandad and then drunk drive  into a schoolyard.  No one cares about you, or if you're offended.  Block the channel, stupid.  It's an XL channel.  You can block it.  That's why XM has that.  You need to F you.  That's what you need to do, okay?  I'm hanging up.  Good.  Hang up.  Cancel XM and drop dead.  Plus, I'll go that far.  All right.  Don't cancel XM.  Go to listen to XM Kids or something.  Yeah, go...  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe that's the wrong thing to say in front of Eric Logan.  And this guy, now he's listening to himself. 
[02:12:00]  He'll be listening.  Listen, I'll go into Sirius Radio.  Good.  Go to Sirius Radio.  There's a fucking dog for the thing.  They stink.  You're going to have to drive a truck to have Sirius.  Throw it in the back of the truck, you fucking hick.  Die.  See, get in front of me.  I'll run you over.  Why don't you fucking blow your nose before you call a national radio show, you crank-doing  jerk-off?  Now he's listening to himself. 
[02:12:30]  Of course he is.  He'll be listening.  Of course he will.  He'll be listening.  He'll call tomorrow.  And he doesn't even have the balls to say, fuck you.  We're uncensored, pal.  You could say, fuck you.  I don't believe in that.  You don't believe in that?  You're a liar and you're a failure.  Well, I'm not a failure.  Yes, you are.  I'm an over-the-road truck driver.  Why don't you have your fucking sinuses fixed?  I'm an over-the-road truck driver.  All truck drivers are over-the-road, stupid.  They don't go through lawns and pools. 
[02:13:00]  You redundant shithead.  I didn't hear you, sir.  I'm doing drugs and surviving an incest experience.  Is that his name?  Dragon wagon?  Dragon wagon.  You've got your ears on. 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  You sounded like you had more brains on the radio.  And it's short time to get there.  Hold on, sir.  Wait, is your name really?  Dude, is your name really Dragon wagon?  You're a grown man with a name that rhymes.  Hey, slow down with the weird grown-up names.  Yeah, that's a childhood name.  At least it doesn't rhyme.  It's not Mopey Opie. 
[02:14:00]  It's Mopey Opie.  Slim Jim.  And whatever the fuck rhymes with Anthony.  I can't think of anything.  Shmanthony.  Well, if you don't understand,  I'm out of here busting my ass  for you people to be doing your dumb radio show.  What are you...  How are you busting your ass for us, stupid?  You're busting your ass to put food on your fat wife's table.  We have nothing to do with it.  Well, at least I got a wife  and I don't go to bed with another man like you.  I don't go to bed with other men.  If I was, I'd molest your children.  What do you think of them apples, fat boy? 
[02:14:30]  What are you going to do  if we stop delivering our roads out of here  and you don't have toilet paper  to wipe your nasty rear end?  I don't need toilet paper.  I hire prostitutes to clean it with their hands.  And my father was a truck driver.  So I like truck drivers.  It's you I don't like.  No.  You're the type to vote for George Bush, aren't you?  You're the type to...  No, sir.  I don't vote.  I talk a lot of shit  and then I sit home on election day.  That's the beauty of me.  But you're the reason the fuel prices are so high  in this country driving...  I'm the reason you motherfucker 
[02:15:00]  you drive a truck!  I have a Saturn.  I cruise prostitutes in Manhattan.  Your food has to get there.  You have fucking 80 gallons of fuel in your vehicle.  I go a month on a gallon of gas.  43rd Street to 15th Street.  Circle for four hours.  Back home.  Why don't you get you a Toyota Hobrit?  What?  Why don't you get us in a Toyota Hobrit or something  if Dave's fuel is running our fuel prices out?  What are you...  Why don't I get a hybrid?  You're driving an 18-wheeler.  Yeah.  I have to. 
[02:15:30]  This is a purpose.  You know...  It's a purpose?  What are you talking about, dude?  What the fuck are you talking about?  You're not this man who's making a difference.  If you died,  some other fatso would sit right where you're sitting  and go,  drive, gas, go.  Nobody would miss you.  He could go home and fuck your wife.  She wouldn't even notice it wasn't you.  Well, I'll tell you what.  You just keep on going down with your little radio show.  I'm calling XM.  I'm making a complaint.  We got the...  The head of programming is right here. 
[02:16:00]  I'm backlogged.  He's not happy.  I got it.  Dragon wagon is not happy.  I haven't.  Yeah, dragon wagon.  I will pray for you.  We got it.  I will pray for you.  You're going to pray for me?  Do something else while you're on your knees in a rest area,  you fucking fat glory hole loving nobody.  I will put you on my church's pray list.  You do that.  And then you should fucking hook it up to the church.  I fucked that one up.  Fuck.  You were rolling.  You were rolling without an error for the whole time. 
[02:16:30]  That's all right.  I just couldn't think of the jerk reference real quick.  Oh.  Ah, dragon wagon got me.  Let me have a Diablo sandwich.  I'll make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  Hey, hey, dragon wagon.  He hung up.  He hung up.  Oh, did he really?  Yes.  Fuck.  As soon as I get home, the first thing I'm going to do is punch your mama in the mouth.  We haven't had one of those jerk offs in a long time.  Isn't it great?  I hope you're listening right now as you're rolling over in a ditch.  Isn't it great?  I love it. 
[02:17:00]  Being on the premium channel, when we were on premium, we never really got those.  We can do no wrong.  As somebody who's been a fan of this show, it's been such a long time since I've heard one of those calls.  We haven't had one of those.  It's a guy that has XM.  He's going through the channels.  He hears us.  And, of course, he's captivated by it.  He's got to listen.  He can't just turn it off.  There's something about being offended and hating something to the point where you can't tune away from it.  And guaranteed, he's still listening. 
[02:17:30]  He will be listening tomorrow.  And he will continue to listen.  Well, and you know what, though?  But he gives truckers a bad name.  We love truckers.  Oh, well, of course.  We have a whole channel, Open Road.  I love them.  They're listening to Hank's Place, too.  That's awesome.  I love the Hank's Place.  We can eat all getting all nervous.  Relax, dude.  The truckers are going anywhere.  I'm protecting the $12.95 a month.  You know how fast he jumped in when I said cancel XM?  Well, hey.  You don't get crazy.  It's hasty now. 
[02:18:00]  It's a dragon wagon.  I'll pay for it for a year just so I can hear that again.  I mean, that was worth it.  Dragon wagon.  I hope he hits an accident and then he's dragging limbs.  I hope your whole left side is paralyzed, you fatso.  All right.  Thank you, Elo, for coming home.  Bye.  Thank you, guys.  And thank you for a fine dinner last night.  You're welcome.  You're welcome, guys.  Hope called me.  Tried to roll at me.  He's like, you know, you should come to dinner.  It'll be good.  Like, you know, it'll be helpful to my...  What the fuck?  You lonely idiot.  You just want me to go so you don't have to talk to these guys by yourself.  There's a truth to that. 
[02:18:30]  All right, buddy.  See you guys.  All right.  Take it easy.  There he goes in his tie.  Looking very handsome.  Nice, clean, white shirt.  Eric, we...  Oh, God.  Oh, Jesus.  Did he look?  Totally.  Of course he did.  I heard his tie actually go...  I love that gag.  Wow.  That was a hammering.  That was very funny.  Doug out Doug is going, can this call get any more fake?  What?  Why Doug? 
[02:19:00]  Doug out Doug.  Meaning the caller, not you.  Oh, the caller?  Yeah.  Oh, you think that?  No, he wasn't serious.  I don't know.  To be honest with you.  I think he was serious.  No, he was dead serious.  No, whatever.  Yeah, I think he was serious.  You get idiots like that.  He doesn't like the show.  He was probably flipping through.  Got to us.  We said something that...  You know what it is, too?  It's not just the general discussion we have about something.  It's always something that hits home a little bit.  Sure.  Maybe he does have that big, fat wife at home, and we were talking about that earlier, and 
[02:19:30]  it upsets him, you know?  Oh, I don't want to hear this.  I've got to go home to it, you know?  That upsets him, so he calls up all angry.  Or maybe a child with a little mental challenge or something.  Maybe he heard yesterday's show and was a little upset at the...  That, by the way, I went home.  Yesterday, we played a lot of clips from a trainable video.  Oh, my God.  We still have five of those clips.  Yeah, we have more of those.  We can do it after the break, but go ahead.  Trainable video.  It's the late 50s, early 60s way of handling retarded children. 
[02:20:00]  They decided they were going to make this instructional film on how parents could train their retarded  children to act like normal, productive citizens of society.  And it's the things...  This subject covered a little girl learning about getting her period and what she should do  as far as using a sanitary pad.  A sanitary pad!  And how she should put it on and take it off and where she should put it. 
[02:20:30]  And I watched the video yesterday.  We heard the audio here on the show.  The video is up on foundrymusic.com?  The video is up on Foundry, and I watched it.  It is hysterical.  It is so goddamn funny.  The older sister of the little retarded girl, who, by the way, Nathaniel said the girl  was 12 or 13 years old.  The girl is no older than 7.  Oh my God.  Like a 7-year-old little retarded girl. 
[02:21:00]  Nathaniel's going to challenge you.  Nathaniel, do you have problems identifying little girls' ages?  Have you ever had to explain to a justice of the peace?  You said the girl was like 12.  I did say 12.  That girl was about 7 years old.  8 maybe at most.  It's not like borderline I would have picked her up or anything.  12, 7, what's the big deal?  I understand.  Because it makes it that much creepier that she's like really young.  Yeah.  Like you wouldn't teach a girl, a normal girl that age, like that stuff at that age. 
[02:21:30]  Wait until they get, you know, around 11 or something like that, maybe 10.  But this girl was like 7 years old.  It was all creepy.  The older sister brings her in the bathroom.  This stark nothing bathroom set.  It's like a toilet in a box.  That's pretty much it.  With this old cabinet with her maxi pads in the cabinet.  And she's pulling them out.  And then the highlight of this film is when the older sister sits on the toilet.  Pulls her panties, these big 50s bloomers down. 
[02:22:00]  And pulls the used maxi pad out.  And it's in color.  This film is in color.  It's not black and white.  Dude, it is like she spread cherry jelly all over the entire pad.  You could not possibly see a more used pad than this.  And she's showing it.  This is a used pad.  We take it off, roll it up, now wrap it up in paper so it doesn't make a mess,  and put it in the nearest waste basket. 
[02:22:30]  And then she makes the little girl put a pad on, on her little panties,  and walk around with it for the rest of the day to practice.  It is the sickest film.  It's up on Foundry.  I implore you to check it out.  She's just bleeding into her underwear like a punched mouth.  What?  Like a hemophiliac.  It was so much blood.  It was so much blood on this thing.  Just disgusting.  Well, we've got to play the clips when we get back.  Oh, yeah.  We have one, two, three.  We have five more to go that we didn't get to yesterday.  I love it. 
[02:23:00]  All right, we're going to take a break.  Why don't we just talk about it?  I wanted to say something before we wrapped up.  There was something I thought I had.  Oh, damn it.  Oh, shit.  Right before the trainables.  I trip you up.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  The complaint?  I don't remember.  Truckers.  Elos.  Yeah, no big deal.  Just the thought that I...  Someone bitching about the show.  No.  Um.  No, whatever.  All right.  What's wrong?  Look at Ben.  I'm sorry.  Where have you been, Ben?  Jimmy's just holding Ben's arm.  Oh, boy. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, possible double homicide on Southern California Freeway.  Yeah, when they put the sheet up over the car windows...  It's not possible anymore.  It happened.  That's death.  That's death.  Yee.  What are you laughing at?  Jimmy's not letting go of Ben's arm.  Why would I let go?  Like, Jimmy does this thing where he'll, like, point out something on TV.  You know how people point out something sometimes?  And they'll, like, touch your arm and go, dude, check that out over there.  Yeah, yeah.  And then quickly the touch goes away.  Yeah, before it becomes homo. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  Jimmy will touch your arm and go, hey, dude, check that out up there on TV.  And then won't take his arm off your...  And he'll keep holding you.  Just gently.  You can pull away.  See, but people always think they're going to wait me out.  How did I diffuse your situation in the elevator yesterday?  Oh, I...  I found a way to just completely diffuse Jimmy.  But...  Please tell me how, because I don't know if I want to tell him.  It's the way my mom does it.  I know.  Oh, is it?  It's the way your mom does it?  It doesn't really count.  I know.  But it works, kind of.  I now walk down five flights of stairs when it comes to going in an elevator with Jim, 
[02:24:30]  because it's God's the morning.  It's so uncomfortable, I can't do it anymore.  Well, first, before we even get in the elevator, a girl gets off the elevator and starts walking  down the hallway by the elevators.  Me and Jimmy are standing there.  And Jimmy sees her coming and pulls out his cell phone and just starts talking into it.  And he's like, what were you saying?  Something about...  Her being pregnant?  I know she's pregnant, but she's going to get rid of it.  Yeah, because I don't want it, and I'm going to tell her.  He goes, I don't care.  I'll push her down the fucking stairs. 
[02:25:00]  And he's saying this as the girl's walking by into his cell phone.  So the girl's horrified, and I'm laughing, because it's not embarrassing me personally.  Then the elevator door opens up, and there's like four people in the elevator.  And now I know I've got to get in this elevator with Jimmy, which is a nightmare, because he  will just embarrass the hell out of you in front of a complete stranger.  I gave up on it.  I now walk downstairs.  You walk in, and what he'll do is the second the door shuts, he'll put his hand on your  shoulder, rub your neck, and go, oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry. 
[02:25:30]  I'm so sorry about last night.  Can't we just talk about it, and make up, and you're in front of an elevator full of  people.  So door shuts.  He starts rubbing my arm, and goes, oh, sweetie, sweetie.  And I just, I turn to him and go, look, I know you're trying to put me in this uncomfortable  situation in front of a bunch of people trying to be funny.  You know, ooh, look, let's embarrass my friend Anthony in front of these people by acting this  way.  I go, fine, do it.  The people are all in on the joke.  Look, it's not going to work anymore. 
[02:26:00]  And it pretty much diffuses the situation.  It did, but there is a way around that.  How's that?  Grabbing my cock?  No, no, no.  That's when we're alone.  I don't need those cock blockers on the elevator interfering.  Ski people.  No, but.  How do you, uh.  I don't know.  I think that even if we break that fourth wall, then somebody drops a nice hot gasser in  the elevator, everybody is still uncomfortable.  Yeah, that you can't get away from.  There's no talking your way out of that one.  All right, so I feel that if I'm being challenged to up the ante, I'll apologize for my lackadaisical 
[02:26:30]  approach, and I'll certainly accept that chance.  I'll blast one out.  All right, a couple really quick phone calls, and we have to take a break.  Tracy Morgan is here.  Jason in L.A., it looks like.  Jason.  Hey, what's happening, fellas?  Hey, man.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I just wanted to say this is the first time I'm listening to you guys, because I'm  too much of a cheap prick to go for the extra $2, but you guys rock, man.  You guys are really good.  It was funny as hell when Jimmy was busting up that trucker, that piece of crap out there.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you, Jason.  Oh, yeah, no, you guys rock. 
[02:27:00]  You guys keep it going.  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Joe in Brooklyn.  Looks like this.  It looks like that phone call turned some people around, so I just want to acknowledge that  right here.  All right.  Joe in Brooklyn, what's up?  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  What's up, sugar tits?  Listen, I just want to let you guys know, I was in a union meeting, because I'm a fucking  union rep for Verizon.  We had about 125 people there, so I got my radio by my cubicle.  All of a sudden, I turn around, I see a bunch of fucking people surrounding me.  They were all listening to Jimmy just rip into this fucking hillbilly.  You guys have got to make a fucking promo out of that. 
[02:27:30]  That is classic.  Thank you, George.  I'm sure Steve is on it as we speak.  Yes.  Of course he is.  Let's go to Gary in Michigan.  Gary?  Yeah.  What's up?  Go ahead, Gary.  I just started listening to you when you played the worst.  First up, I got to say, you guys rock.  Love the show.  Wish I had to pay the extra two bucks back then.  Well, we tried to get you aboard, but no one was listening back then for some reason.  That's all right.  We'll rehash that crap over the next few months anyway.  Over the road, truck driver.  I absolutely love you guys.  Over the road.  I guess it's full of shit.  Thanks, man. 
[02:28:00]  Thank you, Gary.  And Eric from Wisconsin.  How are we doing this morning, guys?  Pretty good, buddy.  Hello.  Hey, I just called to say I give you guys a thumbs up on how you handle Dragon Wagon.  I've been a long-time listener.  I had the premium service before this.  But I think you guys got to do something a little bit more on the terms of what you got  in your pants, if you remember what I'm talking about.  The game, you mean?  No, it was the, yeah, a bunch of women calling in and describing how they had their muff shaved.  Right, right.  That's what I'm saying.  The game. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we haven't done a guess what's in my pants in a while.  Yeah, we'll do one of them.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  All right, thanks, guys.  The phones have just exploded, but we have to take a break.  Tracy Morgan is here.  He's playing Carolines all this weekend in New York City.  We love this guy.  Yes.  We go way back with Tracy.  He was at that celebrity softball game, pretty much naked, pitching in front of like 6,000  people.  We've got to rehash that story a little bit and see what he's been up to.  But in the meantime, we've got Howard Stern talking about XM Satellite Radio.  I want to thank Howard for doing the commercial for us. 
[02:29:00]  Anything for a buck.  Of course.  Speaking of trainables, here's the biggest one.  If you're planning a road trip this weekend, it's time to take XM Satellite Radio along  for the ride.  XM gives you 100% commercial-free music.  It's the ultimate playlist with channels for album rock, alternative, heavy metal, hip-hop,  unsigned bands, blues, jazz.  There's an XM channel for everyone in the family, including the biggest names in news,  sports, talk, and comedy, all in digital quality sound for less than $10 a month.  No wonder it's the most listened-to satellite radio service.

Plus, for a limited time, you'll also get a free home kit so you can connect XM to any  home stereo.  XM makes a great graduation or Father's Day gift.  Check it out.  Electronic stores, including Best Buy and Circuit City.  Beyond AM.  Beyond FM, it's XM Satellite Radio.  The virus is inside us. 
[02:30:00]  OAVirus.com.  Assault the media.  It's time to drop bombs.  We're just pests.  You can't exterminate with black flag.  Your webpage just got hijacked by whack bag.  The gag order's gone.  Time to go to war.  Steve sees napalm burning down your door.  It's hardcore.  Apart from words, you dump in Norton's belly.  The only other girl in his life is Bob Kelly, not you.  When he was a kid, he sucked cock too.  These two obnoxious shock jocks might shock you.  Ass coward.  He don't want to get involved. 
[02:30:30]  Slip in your PJs and light a Java log.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  Spread the virus.  We're having a good one today.  Thanks for checking out the show today, guys. 
[02:31:00]  Greatly appreciate it.  We still have a lot to do today, man.  Who's the broad?  Oh, Jesus.  Do you know one of the XM Human Resources people are out there?  So you're saying who's the broad?  What?  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Which one?  I'm not pointing her out.  Nice.  Nice.  Let's calm down.  What?  Human Resources?  By the way, we've got to talk to Dee Dee, hopefully today, maybe tomorrow.  Dee Dee, our friend from Washington, she's working on a movie called Lubricated in Lunacy. 
[02:31:30]  Really?  Yeah, Dee Dee with the crazy voice that we love.  What happened?  This kid made a 911 call.  He's like, there's blood coming out of my dad's mouth and he fell off the bed.  And the operator says something.  He goes, I don't know, but I think they're dead.  She goes, what do you mean, sweetheart?  He goes, I don't know.  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  And there was blood.  The kid's 911 call.  I wish I had a copy of that.  Poor kid.  His parents have been murdered.  Yeah, the parents probably killed.  Yeah, poor little fella. 
[02:32:00]  I thought it was the other story.  That's why I said, what's going on?  There's a few 911 calls in the news today.  There's another one.  I guess the call.  Yeah, let's get Tracy in here and we'll just continue the show.  Steve, there's a Lacey Peterson 911 call that came in like the original call, I guess.  Oh, really?  And I think it's Scott calling 911.  We might want to get that, too.  Really?  Anything to put more mileage on that story, Jimmy.  Oh, please, yeah.  We doing a baseball game, Jimmy.  Tracy.  What is up, Tracy?  Tracy Morgan in studio.  His first visit on the brand new show.  He's going to be at Caroline's tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday, 212-757-4100 for ticket information. 
[02:32:30]  But, I mean, you've blown up so big, we don't even have to sell these shows, right?  When?  Wow.  You've blown up, bro.  A little bit.  A little bit.  You know, I'm still out there getting them pregnant and stuff.  Yeah?  Yes.  You don't wear bags?  Nah.  Never.  Hey, where's Kim?  Let me, can I smell Kim?  Thank you.  Sniffing Jimmy's fingers?  Yes.  That's great.  I think she said her name was Kim.  She had a wig and a Colby jersey. 
[02:33:00]  I hope it was a she.  It's good to be back here with you guys, man.  I miss you.  Yeah.  Word up.  Definitely.  Last time we saw each other, we went through, what, 30 cases at the baseball game?  I was pitching.  Yeah, we first met Tracy.  Jim Brewer introduced us to Tracy.  Brewer was talking about Tracy Morgan for years, and we finally got to meet Tracy at our  celebrity softball game.  Brewer just brought him along.  He wasn't really doing our show at that point or anything, and Tracy just freaking stole  the show.  I had a great time, man. 
[02:33:30]  At one point, I was in, like, the pool naked with, like, two chicks, man.  You got to understand, we do these celebrity softball games from time to time, and there  were 6,000 people at the last one.  No exaggeration.  It was sold out at a minor league stadium, and Tracy decided he needed a pitch, so he  walks out of the dugout in just his tighty-whities, man, his underwear.  With a jock, right?  With your pair of jeans.  Yeah.  It was just a jock strap.  That was all he was wearing.  Jock strap and cleats.  I'm in the books.  I'm in the books now.  I mean, they open up the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm in the books.  I'm in the books. 
[02:34:00]  You know no Fugazi here.  Dude, those pictures have circulated around the internet for years.  Yeah.  For years.  They pop up every once in a while when I'm doing searches.  Yeah.  You pitching in a jock strap in front of 6,000 people.  With a gut.  With a gut.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you're a lot thinner.  Speed bump.  You got that Hollywood thinness to you now.  What happened?  You trimmed down a whole lot.  I went out there, and I got on some no-carb stuff.  You know, I'm a carnival.  I'm a New York guy, man.  I love my carbs, man.  You know, it's just crazy out there, man.  But I'm having a good time.  I'm partying. 
[02:34:30]  Hollywood slim now.  Nah, you know what I mean?  I still drink my beer and all that.  My brewage, yeah.  Got it.  I just got into a shoving match at the club the other night.  Get out.  With who?  Yeah, with my cousin.  Really?  Yeah, man.  I mean, I don't drink Cristal.  No.  I'm in brewage.  Yeah, I drink brewage.  Why is my bill $1,600?  And why is it coming to me, dude?  $1,600?  I had like two platinum chains, and they got ripped off my neck and everything. 
[02:35:00]  So, wait.  Your cousin is drinking a Cristal?  No.  He was drinking brew, too.  He just ordered it as a gag.  Are you kidding me?  He ordered it as a gag?  He said, you're rich.  You got a TV show.  I said, no.  The show got canceled, dude.  Can't order stuff like that now, man.  And they come up to you with a bill, and you're getting a shoving match with your cousin.  Yeah, man.  Did you kick his ass?  Nah, no punches were thrown.  We just grabbed each other's shirts.  A few buttons popped off.  That was it.  I broke a nail, though. 
[02:35:30]  I'm Hollywood now.  You got to watch out.  I don't eat carbs.  I'm Hollywood.  I'm La Brea.  You know, getting back to the celebrity softball game, the best part of the celebrity softball  game was afterwards.  We were in the locker room.  That's what Michael Jackson touched me, but y'all didn't know that.  That's what Michael Jackson touched me.  And you were hammered, man.  Yeah.  You had to have half a case of beer easily.  Oh, yeah.  And a little of this, you know, a little this.  Yeah, for dolo. 
[02:36:00]  That's marijuana, not coke.  Then you were trying to rally the troops to get a trip going to Harlem.  Yeah.  You wanted to, like, get all the white boys together.  And let's go up to Harlem.  Yeah, a little field trip to Harlem.  I had a couple of strippers that I wanted to introduce you guys to.  That's right, yeah.  Young, fresh, and green.  I've never laughed harder in my life.  No exaggeration.  And you were so on talking about how white we really were and that we needed a field  trip to Harlem.  Little soul, man.  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:36:30]  Get you guys some afros and stuff like that.  We'd have been great.  You know, shake a few people down.  We'd have been great.  Harlem ain't like the old days, though, now.  Good cop, bad cop.  You know what it is.  They're kind of, I don't know, they're reworking Harlem.  They're fixing everything up.  Well, what happened was a Starbucks appeared.  Yeah.  That's what I knew was going down here.  That's the beginning, right?  Yeah.  A Genovese and a Starbucks came to the ghetto.  A Genovese and a Starbucks, that's when it's going commercial.  And then who bought the Apollo and fixed that all up? 
[02:37:00]  Wasn't it like white people?  Mm-hmm.  Like some white people bought.  Some white people bought the Apollo.  You know that.  We ain't have the money.  We ain't have the bread.  No.  I think this white dude bought one of Whitney Houston's Grammys.  I went next door.  It was Whitney Houston's neighbor.  I went to his crib.  Really?  And I seen a Grammy sitting on the coffee table.  I said, sir, how did you get that?  He said, don't you worry about it.  And then I looked on the wall.  He had my prerogative platinum album on his wall.  I said, how'd you get that?  He said, don't worry about it. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  I said, there's a garage sale out over there.  You know Whitney Houston lost a tooth?  Yeah?  Really?  She lost a tooth, man.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  How do you think she lost a tooth?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I hope Bobby ain't smoking.  I don't know.  It's either Bobby knocked it out or she chipped it with a crack pipe.  I don't know.  Man, she just looks like a crackhead these days.  You got to leave that Coke alone, man.  It's 99 and 0.  You can't win.  Nah.  Yeah, you can't win.  She sweats like a pig. 
[02:38:00]  You see Bridget Nielsen?  Yeah.  Oh, she used to be a hot chick.  She used to be a hot chick, yeah.  Probably, man.  That just might be time, though.  I still get a pregnant, though.  Oh.  I still beat that.  Nah.  I'll get a pregnant and a heartbeat.  What?  That's Bridget Nielsen.  Oh.  She dating Foofy Foofy.  That's over, though, because she ended up marrying the Italian dude.  She did?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  The Italian midget, they call him.  So, you don't wear bags at all.  I don't like wearing bags.  Do you like when they tell you that you don't have to pull out? 
[02:38:30]  Like, I like that when they tell me that I'm on the pill and you don't have to pull out.  There's something really sexy about that.  Yes.  Why?  Yes.  Yes.  Because we old school, man.  We are old school.  I can't take the time out to rip a package and all.  Come on, man.  I'm 36 years old.  My concentration's got to be right there.  Yeah, but you don't want to.  It's like when you masturbate, everything's got to be quiet.  The pillows don't touch my arm.  I don't want the pillows to touch my arm.  I get everything straight.  I've got to set everything up.  I've got to do like six push-ups.  You know what I'm saying?  Just get everything straight. 
[02:39:00]  Fixing track in the contrast on the TV.  No music playing in the background.  No music.  Nothing.  Everything's got to be sound.  You ever notice when you masturbate, everything sound like a car door slamming?  Outside distractions?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's all.  I can't do it there.  It's like when you have sex with your woman after you've been with her for like 10 years.  You know, you've got to concentrate and you've got to focus on that dead roach in the corner.  You've got to focus on that ball of dirty socks.  Oh, my God. 
[02:39:30]  Complete concentration.  You know what the aroma is when grown people have sex?  When you ever walk by a room after like two grown people have sex, it smells like coffee.  It smells like potato chips and pretzels.  It smells like butt, testicles, Bacardi and Coke, Marlboro lights, and Doublemint.  That's the smell of love.  Dirty socks and tears. 
[02:40:00]  Like my son is 19, right?  And all he does is masturbate at this point.  You know, I've got to get him something because he's going to go pop.  He might kill me and his mother and say that the devil made him do it or something.  I've got to get him laid.  I've got to get this dude laid.  But you know what his room smells like, right?  Bust off in socks.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  He's 19.  I caught him.  He was humping my leg the other day, man.  I had to beat him with a newspaper.  Why doesn't he have a girlfriend?  I don't know.  The dude is into his academics. 
[02:40:30]  Really?  He's into academics.  That kind of gets in the way sometimes.  Yeah, he's into academics.  I say, oh, man.  That gets in the way, bro.  You don't know, brother.  Got to get off that stuff.  When I was 19, by the time I was 19, I had an empire ready.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I had several kids.  Several kids.  Of which I never claimed.  How many kids do you think you got?  Between 12 and about 35.  I told you, I don't use bags, man.  Never.  We don't pull out.  I think that's a real woman when she says, no, you don't got to.  Go ahead. 
[02:41:00]  Go for it.  Well, maybe she's just looking for the Tracy Morgan money.  Well, you know, whenever I need income taxes and stuff like that.  Oh, some deductions?  You know me, man.  I'm like Jim Brown, baby.  I'm in the Hall of Fame.  As a matter of fact, I'm doing a celebrity golf tournament.  What?  While I'm in town, yes.  It's a benefit for women with C-section scars, man.  I'm trying to raise some money for C-section scars and stretch marks.  That's my thing.  Are you a golfer, Tracy?  No, but we just put together. 
[02:41:30]  And one of the key notes speakers will be Al Sharpton.  Benoit Benjamin will be speaking.  Sharpton is a golfer?  Benoit Benjamin.  Who's that?  Benoit Benjamin testified against Jason Williams for the Nets.  That's right.  Really?  Benoit was sleeping on his couch and he testified.  See, if I was Jason Williams, I would have said yes.  I would have just implicated the Harlem Globetrotters.  I would have kept putting the word cocaine and Globetrotters together.  Because they'd be loved.  And I know a lot of people in that jury, in the jury box, love them.  So I would have just said yes.  Yes.  I admit. 
[02:42:00]  I was doing cocaine with the Harlem Globetrotters.  Yes.  Yes, me and the G-Trotters was doing coke.  Yes.  I didn't mean to shoot nobody, but yes.  Metal Lock Lemmon brought four eight balls.  Yes.  Yes, Curly McNeil.  Yes.  I was sniffing with Curly.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  Do some tricks.  Yeah.  Distract the jury a little bit.  Sure.  There's someone on the phone that has a Tracy Morgan story.  Uh-oh.  Let's go here for a second.  Colin in Connecticut.  Colin.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Well, we have Tracy Morgan in the studio. 
[02:42:30]  He's playing Carolines all this weekend here in New York City.  Well, I was an intern at Saturday Night Live five years ago.  And, Trey, I don't know if you remember me.  My name's Colin Cosell.  Oh!  What's up, Colin?  That's Howard Cosell's grandson.  I've actually met him, too, I think.  That's my dude.  That's my dude.  Wait.  Howard Cosell was your grandfather?  Yeah.  Jimmy and I did stand-up.  Stand-up New York together.  Stand-up New York.  Oh, no kidding.  Yeah.  What's up, bro, bro?  How you been, man?  I cannot complain, my man, but I've got the best Tracy Morgan story ever. 
[02:43:00]  Shoot.  They brought in a new intern one day, and this kid was completely starstruck, and Trey's  just like, yo, Colin, go and grab this kid, bring him down the hall, and tell him Trey  Morgan's got something to tell him.  I was like, all right, so I grabbed this kid, and I think his name was Winston.  I said, Winston, Tracy Morgan wants to see you.  He goes, really?  And his jaw drops, and his eyes are big, and he cannot wait.  Bring him into Tracy Morgan's dressing room, because Trey used to let me go and smoke cigarettes  in there.  Thank you very much, Trey. 
[02:43:30]  Right on, baby.  And sits him down, and he's got a chair right there, and he pops in this orange videocassette.  Now, he's got an orange videocassette.  It's either a Disney film or a nasty-ass porn.  And he pops it in, and lo and behold, there's this black dude with this 18-inch bone, and  this white girl dressed as a cheerleader blowing him.  And this kid's fucking eyes blew out of his head.  Blew out of his head.  That's right.  Remember that suit? 
[02:44:00]  Oh, dude.  Just to loosen him up, right?  That'll loosen.  Real people do real things.  Oh, hell yeah, man.  Go outside to smoke a blood, and people will ask for his phone number, and he'll say,  Colin, take this and walk the other way.  I gave the guy the tape, too.  Oh, man.  What a guy.  That kid was crazy, man.  We had a good time, though.  Yeah, we did, but...  I like the fact that this is Howard Cosell's grandson.  I know.  I haven't really...  That was my dude, man.  We used to go to lunch together, man.  He used to tell me stories about his grandfather, you know? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  How old were you when he passed away?  That was April 23rd, 95.  I was 15.  So, 15.  So, you had some time with him.  I mean, you remember him.  I had a lot of time with him.  No, he was around constantly.  Who has the toupee?  I've heard rumors that someone has the toupee.  That's impossible.  I used to put the tape in for...  When my grandmother passed away, I used to put the tape in that thing for him.  Wow.  Yeah.  No, we were very, very close.  Hey, did you ever meet Ali?  Oh, of course.  Oh, man.  You want to hear a great story. 
[02:45:00]  I was six years old, and that was the first time I met Ali.  Six years old, and I wake up to this big black man shaking me and saying,  Come on, little man.  Your grandfather wants to come have lunch with us.  And I wake up.  There's this gigantic black man shaking me.  And I'm like, what in the fuck is going on?  That's all you know at the time.  He walks me out, and I'm shaking.  I'm like, hi, Papa.  Who's this?  All right, you met Muhammad, I see.  I'm like, yes, I did.  He said, Muhammad is a good friend of mine and the greatest of all time. 
[02:45:30]  I was like, okay.  This means nothing to me.  That is a great impression, dude.  Wow.  Well, he's...  I grew up with him, man.  I used to listen to him screaming at the television.  We got him into hockey, and he used to yell, John Van Beesbrook.  We taught him that his nickname was Beezer.  So we'd sit there going, Beezer.  Beezer.  I can't wait for halftime.  I need to take a tinny.  And they're like, what?  Don't just sit down. 
[02:46:00]  Isn't that funny?  This guy's just like, that's his grandfather.  Everyone has their kooky grandfather stories, but this is how it goes south.  He has an impression and all.  Hey, dude, they should put you on Saturday Night Live, man.  I wish they would.  I'd use the work, goddammit.  Right on.  Well, we got to get you in here.  I would love to go in there, man.  All right.  Hell yeah.  Well, hold on to the line.  We're going to get your contact info and have you in.  Oh, Jimmy's shaking his head no?  What?  No, I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Jimmy doesn't want you in here.  Jimmy's like, no, that's not true.  No, I actually liked him. 
[02:46:30]  We met at New York.  He was a nice dude, man.  I liked him a lot.  And actually, my friends were so excited to meet Jimmy that Jimmy was just moving to  his new apartment, and I introduced my friends to him because they were big fans of Jimmy  Norton.  Who isn't?  I mean, how can you not be?  He's gorgeous.  And they ended up having a conversation about how to hang a mirror on sheetrock.  That's right, Jimmy.  I really did.  I bought an apartment.  They should have just lined cocks up that I could lick on the way into my door.  I bought candles and little rocks and a mirror. 
[02:47:00]  Bed, bath, and beyond, Jimmy.  Bed, bath, and beyond, right?  All right.  So off air, they're going to take your information and stuff.  Yeah, hold on.  Yeah, we'd love to have you in, Colin.  I'd love to come in, guys.  I'd love to.  All right, cool.  There he goes, Colin from Connecticut.  Colin, be good.  That's pretty cool.  Cedric from Tennessee wants in.  Cedric.  What's happening?  What's up?  Hey, man, I just want to know if Tracy got any steaks for sale, man.  I'm having a barbecue this weekend.  You're talking about the meat man character I'm playing.  Hell yeah, man.  You know me, man.  But I'll be at the barbecue, baby. 
[02:47:30]  Yes, word, man.  Hey, I'm going to invite your little brother, Spoonie Love, in, too, man.  You got it, man.  Let me tell you something about Spoon, man.  You know, Caligula invented the orgy, right?  But Spoonie invented the pop-off.  You know, the jump-off.  You know what I'm saying?  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Holler at your boy.  Have a good barbecue, man.  Hey, word.  All right.  They're speaking some kind of code language.  I understood that.  We don't quite understand.  White people.  White people.  We just heard nothing, nothing, nothing. 
[02:48:00]  Caligula.  Oh, okay.  It's good black stuff.  Hey, you call it black prowl.  How long have you been off SNL?  You've been there for a long time, man.  Yeah, I was there for seven years, but I've been off for about two now.  Off for two.  Do you visit or do you want to go back now?  Nah, man.  I'm good.  I'm moving forward.  I'm out of daddy's home.  The last two or three years, you just blew up.  Like, for a while.  That show got canceled, man.  I went out to L.A.  No, but I mean the last couple of years of Saturday Night Live, you just blew up.  Yeah, I mean.  I'm like, all that talent was just sitting there for all those years, and then finally 
[02:48:30]  they used you.  Yeah, it took them about four years.  It was unbelievable.  It was like steaming Willie Beeman for many given Sunday.  Where was Brian Kello?  Where was Brian Kello?  You had some unbelievable characters the last couple of years there, and I'm thinking at  home, all this was in them, and they're not using them.  They didn't use them for many years.  I don't think Lauren, and I'm sure you love Lauren, but I personally don't think he uses  black talent very well, to be honest with you.  And I've heard that complaint from other performers.  It was like, I mean, Murphy blew up when, you know, I think Ebersole was there.  Yeah, Ebersole was there. 
[02:49:00]  But, you know, I never looked at it like a color thing.  Excuse me.  I never looked at it like a color thing.  I just take time for people to know your voice and the writers to get to know your voice,  and I'm from a different world anyway, so, you know, I just leaned back for the  first couple of years.  I played my cards right, let them cast me and stuff, you know what I'm saying?  Let them put the lipstick on me and the dresses on me and all of that, and cut my balls off,  you know, and all of that stuff.  You know what I'm saying?  But then after a while, then all the heavy hitters started breaking out, so I just said, 
[02:49:30]  you know, I stepped up.  I stepped right in there.  Yeah.  And I'm glad it happened like that because, you know, then I got my own TV show, which  got canceled after 22 episodes.  What happened?  You did 22, though.  I don't know.  You would have to ask NBC.  I got 22, but you know, when I went out to L.A., my vagina was nice and pretty.  Now I look like a orangutan back there.  You know the big pig orangutan cootie cat?  I got the big baboon cootie cat now.  Red and sore. 
[02:50:00]  I mean, you know, it was nice and pretty when I got out there, you know?  I saw you on Sharon Osbourne's show cooking, what were you cooking, like little beans and  franks?  It was really funny, man.  Pork and beans and franks with grape Kool-Aid.  It was really funny.  That's a ghetto delicacy, man.  That's a ghetto delicacy.  It's called franks and bean casserole with grape Kool-Aid.  Grape Kool-Aid, of course.  With a little slice of lemon in it.  And I got to cook a sweet potato pie because when you get these TV shows, you do a lot 
[02:50:30]  of press.  Yeah.  I mean, you amp up.  I mean, NBC pulled out all the stops.  You know, I was the next Cosby show and all of that stuff.  So I got to cook a sweet potato pie with Bo Jackson and everything.  Really?  You know I'm on the anti-doping committee for comedians.  I didn't know that.  So if you're smoking marijuana before you set, I'm going to see you out there.  You're going to be tested in these clubs.  You know who's going to be the surprise witness in this Michael Jackson case, right?  It's going to be Bubbles.  Yeah, I know.  They're very distracting, aren't they? 
[02:51:00]  What are you guys doing?  The chimp.  Just leave all that shit alone right now.  The chimp going to pull the zipper down.  It's going to be Jim Brewer.  It's going to be Jim Brewer in the chimp suit.  You're going to see Michael Jackson, they're going to bring, the bailiff is going to walk  Bubbles down the aisle and Bubbles is going to glimpse at Mike.  Mike going to turn the defense table over and say, you banana-eating chimpanzee witness  protection program.  You be eating bananas in Alaska. 
[02:51:30]  I'm done with you.  What do you think, Mike?  And Bubbles going to say, no, no, I've seen it all, Your Honor.  I've seen it all.  Yes, he touched one of them boys over there by the teacups.  Did you, when you, when you show one of them little boys by the giraffe enclosement.  You went for a year on the show.  Do you, did it, did it not, I actually didn't see it.  That's great.  Did they, did they write stuff that you didn't like or were you happy with the final product  and it just didn't get ratings?  I didn't see it.  Of course, I was a black dude, but what I'm going to say.  They wrote stuff that you thought was like this.  I'm quite sure the slaves didn't want to pick cotton either. 
[02:52:00]  Well, slaves didn't make 30 grand a week.  I bet you, I bet you, I bet you, I bet you the slaves were smoking weed.  They used to stop in the middle of picking and go,  you see all this cotton we got to pick?  Get hot, man.  You can't pick all this cotton sober.  You're liking that Egg McMuffin there, huh?  That's a sausage.  Sausage?  So much for no carbs.  It smells really good though.  Want a bite?  No, thanks, man.  Wait, someone was saying that you had the funniest line ever on SNL. 
[02:52:30]  What?  Scott in Chicago.  If it's about Britney.  Hey.  Hey.  I think Tracy delivered the funniest line in the history of Saturday Night Live.  I love you, God bless your soul.  When you did Astronaut Jones, and she was the alien asking for help to save her planet.  I said, why don't you turn around and show me that big fat ass?  Big fat ass.  Remember the whole sketch?  I was like, yeah, right.  I did not stop.  What was that like?  Was she pissed about that?  Who?  Nah, they loved it, baby.  They loved it.  Didn't you improv that? 
[02:53:00]  That wasn't the original line.  You added to that line.  Yeah.  Yeah, I did a lot.  I used to do that all the time.  And Britney didn't have a problem with that?  Nah, I tongue kissed Britney about six, seven times.  Oh, wow.  That whole week.  Because I was doing...  But that wasn't that.  When I used to do Woodrow, which was the guy that lived in the sewer, he got the girls,  but I got to kiss him.  I kissed Lucy Liu.  And I would try to put my tongue in their mouth.  Like at the time, she was dating Justin.  He was standing right there, and I dared him to say something.  You know the reason why Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston broke up, right? 
[02:53:30]  Me.  Yep.  Stop calling the house, Brad.  Leave it alone, okay?  It's over.  Stop calling the house.  She's pregnant by me.  Leave it alone.  Just leave it alone.  Walk away, Brad.  Would you smell her ass, Jennifer Aniston?  Come on, man.  Jennifer Aniston can fart in my mouth.  I'm a freak, baby.  I'm a freak.  He's old school filthy.  I love Tracy.  I'm a freak.  I'm a weedy, weedy, bing-bong freak.  Come over here and fart in my mouth.  That's great.  Get over here.  Hug J-Lo at the same time. 
[02:54:00]  Poop right in my mouth.  I'm a weedy, bing-bong freak.  What do you think about Britney being pregnant there, Tracy?  That's my child.  Really?  That's my child.  It's going to come out.  Everything's going to come out.  All the facts are going to come out.  That's going to be a surprise.  That body's getting ruined, though.  Nah, that's the way I like it.  Yeah?  Stretch marks and all that.  It's the mark of womanhood.  I like cellulite.  Any woman that goes against cellulite is going against womanhood.  That's all the part.  Hey, that's got to be jelly, because jam don't shake like that.  You like a woman after she's had a kid or two? 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  Yeah?  I don't like nothing new.  No?  But my money.  I want a woman that's been through the fire.  Through the fire.  Really?  Yeah.  You don't like them all nice and tight?  Hey, listen.  I'm not a scorer.  I'm a rebounder.  If you're coming out of bad relations, come see me.  I'm Matt Patelons.  Come see me.  Hey, I take kids, step kids, all of that. 
[02:55:00]  Force the kids.  Come see me.  If you're getting social security checks for one of them kids, give me half.  I'll take care of your life.  Wow.  You don't see many guys like that.  Yes.  I'm a rebounder.  I'll dive over the scoring table for a rebound.  I'm with it.  We should play.  And it's a bonus if you got crust on the back of your feet.  Oh, God.  With that little black welfare toenail at the end.  That is really nasty, man. 
[02:55:30]  See the women wearing the sandals or something in the store?  They're shuffling along, and there's just that big calloused, crusty thing on the back of their heel.  Oh, you like that?  That's sexy.  It's like yellowish, white.  You know what you mean?  You ain't made love until you had a woman that's in a vegetated state or something.  Why?  I don't like resistance, man.  I like to get straight to the point.  Like a Terry Schiavo kind of?  When you're fucking the arm, you just flop over the side of the bed and don't move.  You know, that's what I'm like, dangling over your shoulders and stuff.  I had this one chick that, you know, one crippled chick. 
[02:56:00]  That was my thing.  Really?  Hey, man, it's sexy.  It's a sexy thing when you sneak up into ICU.  You go, yeah.  And have sex with a woman with IVs hanging out of her arms.  That's sexy.  Yeah.  You know what they say?  Sometimes white guys like to drive around and find black prostitutes and break their arm.  Really?  Sadistic white dudes from the suburbs.  Break their arm?  Break their arm.  Why?  When they're having oral sex, they just break their arm. 
[02:56:30]  Some white guys get off on that.  I never heard that.  I've never heard that in my life.  It's tragic.  You've never seen a prostitute with a cast on?  I've seen some prostitutes with their cast.  Yeah, they're on.  Because, yeah, the jaw broke her arm.  That's because of white guys?  That's the jaw broke her arm.  I always assumed it was the pimp or something.  No, the pimp don't care.  He sent her to the hospital to get that cast on.  Then all the other chicks on the strip signed her cast.  You ever seen a baby with a cast on?  That's dark, right?  I love dark.  That's pretty sad.  Dark.  You're always assuming it was something bad.  I was the one that told Luke Skywalker, F. Obi-Wan Kenobi. 
[02:57:00]  Really?  We're going to hang out with the Emperor and Darth Vader.  That's where the party's at.  We're going to the Death Star.  I booed Star Wars.  Why?  Because of Obi-Wan Kenobi.  Yeah?  Damn, man.  The Force be with you.  Come on, man.  Emperor, Darth Vader.  You seen that suit?  You seen Obi-Wan Kenobi's suit?  Did you see Darth Vader's suit?  Darth Vader got fashion sense.  He probably redid that.  Fuck. 
[02:57:30]  Sean John made that Darth Vader suit.  You know Papa Smurf was a bad drinker?  Wow.  He has two domestic violence charges for putting his hands on Smurfette.  He drove a cutler's Sierra.  You can change directions.  He's all over the road today.  He knocked down two or three mushrooms over in Smurfville trying to park that car one night.  Don't we got to play for Tracy?  Do you know Batman and Robin really didn't get along?  Um-be-knowings.  Um-be-knowings.  Because Robin smoked Smurfville lights and he burnt the hole in the bat seat in the passenger 
[02:58:00]  car.  And Batman begged him.  First of all, there was a lot of resentment there because Robin didn't ever have a belt.  No, he didn't have a utility belt.  He hated Commissioner Gordon.  He thought Commissioner Gordon was a jerk.  This is what Robin, he said he's a jerk.  Yeah.  He keeps putting the bat signal in the air.  How do you think you're joking him?  No, we coming.  Why don't you just use the phone?  That's why Verizon installed him.  He had a big cock, by the way, Robin.  Yeah. 
[02:58:30]  Legendarily big cock.  He had to wear two little things to keep it from bulging out.  Oh, really?  Come on.  Yo, it's like Janet Jackson.  You know, one titty popping out?  Come on.  That's comedy.  If both would have popped out, we would have been like, oh, that's sexy.  But one is like, oh, a titty popped out.  That was, for me, I mean, America went crazy.  But that was just like two black chicks having to fight.  You know, whoever titty popped out, that's the winner.  She went for hers.  She went for hers.  I want to play this 911 thing for Tracy.  I know. 
[02:59:00]  I want to hear some of this.  Because Tracy, you're a parent.  Do your kids fight a lot?  Mm-mm.  They get along.  No fighting?  They get along whoop their ass.  That's true.  It's usually like this call is, the 911 call.  It's this white trash from the South.  And they call the cops all the time because of these goddamn kids fighting.  Which is no reason to call the goddamn cops.  Is this grown-up gutty?  No, this is a 911 call.  This woman is very angry at the 911 operator because he tried to make a little joke. 
[02:59:30]  He tried to make...  It's a great joke.  It's a great joke.  If you're a 911 operator, you probably shouldn't be making jokes at all.  I think they should because I think they hear a lot of shit.  But I got to tell you, I got into a little argument with my girlfriend last night about this call.  I played it.  And the first thing I said was, this friggin' bitch should shut her mouth.  She's trash.  She should do some parenting.  The whole thing is her kids are fighting.  She's got two daughters. 
[03:00:00]  One's 12, one's 14.  They're fighting.  And from the call, I assume they're done fighting.  She said they were fighting.  One of them kicked a hole in the door.  And you don't call the cops for this.  You grab them by the hair.  You bang their heads together.  You do whatever you got to do.  The cops are busy.  They don't need this.  And the only reason the 911 operator made the joke is because he's probably heard this a thousand times.  It's not serious.  It's not like he was joking that one daughter fell on a knife and she's bleeding and he's making jokes.  This is two white trash girls pulling each other's hair. 
[03:00:30]  And this bitch is wasting cops' time by calling.  That's it.  So he makes a little joke.  Then after the joke, this woman gets so pissed and she is ragged and severe.  Now she's getting the guy's name.  She's going to report him.  This, that.  Now the fight is a total backseat.  Now it's not an emergency to call the cops.  If this was an emergency where she should have called the cops and he made a joke,  she would have blown off the joke and said,  Hey, look, it's an emergency.  I'm very pissed at what you said and I'm going to deal with you.  But look, I got an emergency to send the cops. 
[03:01:00]  She completely forgets about the emergency that she was calling the cops for.  And now her whole life is getting this guy in trouble.  And the guy also, when you hear it right after the joke, the guy realizes in a second,  you hear a second when he realizes, uh-oh, I fucked up.  And he starts the apology wagon.  Yeah.  But it don't work.  It's a very interesting call.  Yeah, she's going to cause trouble now.  You got to hear this, Tracy.  Let's go to this call real fast.  It's a shorty.  911, what is your emergency?  Yes, I need a police officer over here.  What's going on? 
[03:01:30]  I've got two teenage daughters and I just got home from work.  They were physically fighting with each other.  One of them kicked a hole in a door.  And they're 12 and almost 14.  And the 12-year-old is completely out of control.  And I can't physically, if she's as big as I am, I can't control her.  Okay.  Did you want us to come over to shoot her?  Yeah.  There it is.  See, that's the joke.  All right. 
[03:02:00]  That's the joke.  Now, look, she's laughing during the fucking call.  She's saying, look, I just got home from work.  This isn't an emergency.  This is not a reason to call 911.  911, very important.  It's very important.  You don't want to block the line.  Right.  Call your husband.  Call the neighbor.  Knock their frigging heads together.  You don't call 911 for this.  And she's laughing. 
[03:02:30]  I got home from work.  This isn't an emergency.  So the guy makes a joke.  Is she laughing?  I didn't hear that.  I didn't catch that.  At the beginning, she goes, she's kind of like that nervous titter.  Like, I just, like, she's almost trying to justify this.  Oh, absolutely.  I can't believe this.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  We'll play it in front of the beginning again.  And let it roll all the way through.  Walk.  Here we go.  That wasn't, uh.  Here it is again.  911, what is your emergency?  Yes.  I need a police officer over here.  What's going on?  I've got two teenage daughters, and I just got home from work.  Right there. 
[03:03:00]  They were physically fighting with each other, and one of them kicked a hole in a door.  And they're 12 and almost 14, and the 12-year-old is completely out of control.  And I can't, I physically, if she's as big as I am, I can't control her.  Okay, did you want us to come over to shoot her?  Are you there?  Excuse me?  That's a joke.  Okay, so.  Who are you?  What is your name?  Oh!  I hate her!  Now that's where he's, that's where he realized, uh-oh, I fucked up. 
[03:03:30]  And you hear him trying to cover, uh-oh, what was the emergency again?  What was the emergency again?  I'm at 911.  What's wrong with us?  Can I help you?  She needs a stiff one.  You're right.  Because now the emergency takes a complete backseat to her and her new mission, which is getting this guy in trouble.  Why did this dumbass answer the question, he should have just hung up the phone, which is bad to do on a 911 call, but you know what?  You've got to feed your own family.  Hang up the phone, stupid.  He was probably feeling good, you know?  He was having a good day at work.  Right, right. 
[03:04:00]  He said, what the hell?  Let me throw this one out.  He knew it wasn't an emergency.  Right, exactly.  That's what it is.  He knew because he's done this thousands of times.  He knows this call.  Now, also, I'm not saying the guy isn't an idiot.  You're a 911 operator.  It's not time to do open mic night, you know?  You're trying out some new material.  You're trying out some new shit on the 911 line.  How out of control is she?  I owe the 12-year-old money, and I'm dodging her. 
[03:04:30]  It's probably not a wise thing for this guy to test out a good point, Anthony.  Good point.  But that doesn't stop, that doesn't give her a reason to now turn into a mission, this  mission she has now to get the guy in trouble.  She turned into the Incredible Hulk, man.  She did.  All of a sudden, now, emergency is emergency.  It's so funny because it was just that moment of silence.  It's like she's on the phone.  You can just see her face looking at the receiver like, oh, yeah.  Well, if we could go back a little more and get to the part where you realize. 
[03:05:00]  That same attitude probably caused a divorce.  Right.  And the reason why her kids are animals.  The backlash of the divorce.  There you go.  The kids are out of control.  Here, let's go back to the tape.  Here it is.  The uncomfortableness.  Are you there?  Excuse me?  That's a joke.  Okay.  Who are you?  What is your name?  Mike Forbus.  Okay.  That's not funny, Mike.  I'm sorry.  Guess what?  I'm going to file a formal complaint.  I don't blame you, babe. 
[03:05:30]  Hey, because you know what?  This is really not very funny.  I know it's not, ma'am.  I apologize.  Well, guess what?  It's not going to be very funny when I go in front of your supervisor and tell him.  I understand.  I guess he can just listen to the tape.  Yes, he can.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  You know what's great?  There's another call.  There's another call coming.  Excuse me, lady.  Which is probably a real 911 call.  Help me!  Help me!  Yeah.  We got a guy.  Yeah, there's some electrocuted worker up on a line somewhere.  That's the best part.  You hear the phone ring in the background, and this guy's like, fuck that. 
[03:06:00]  I got to save my job now.  There's real trouble on that other line.  Yes, I'm an asshole woman.  Yes, you're right.  I'm going to file a complaint.  I don't blame you, ma'am.  I don't blame you.  Yeah, sure.  Why would he give his name?  What a dummy.  He actually went by the book here, and that'll probably save him.  That might save him.  If they don't just blow him off completely just for doing what he did, if there's any  chance of being safe, the fact that he did apologize, gave his name, here it is, and  not just hang up and hide like one of those prank calls gone bad when you're a kid.  It's like, you know, hey, you got 10-pound balls? 
[03:06:30]  Yeah.  How do you walk?  I got caller ID.  Your phone number is 516.  Click.  You hang up.  Wait in the corner for your pop to come home and punch you.  I can't believe somebody would do something like that, man.  I know.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  Just listen.  I think it's hilarious to hear the phone ring in the background.  It's another call coming out.  This guy's supposed to answer.  Go ahead.  Mike Forbus.  Okay.  That's not funny, Mike.  I'm sorry.  Guess what?  I'm going to file a formal complaint.  I don't blame you a bit. 
[03:07:00]  Hey, because you know what?  This is really not very funny.  I know it's not, ma'am.  I apologize.  Well, guess what?  It's not going to be very funny when I go in front of your supervisor and tell him.  I understand.  I guess he can just listen to the tape.  Yes, he can.  I'm sorry.  I apologize.  Well, sorry doesn't care.  I need a police officer.  Hold on.  Three.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Ma'am?  Yeah.  Okay.  12 and...  10 and 12 or 12 and 14?  12 and 13 and a half. 
[03:07:30]  Okay.  All right.  I'll get the police officers on the way.  They're on an emergency call right now, but as soon as I can get one free, I'll get them on the way.  Oh, well, don't rush or anything.  Well, I apologize for my smart remark, and I will get them en route as soon as I can.  Okay.  And what is your name again?  Mike Forvis.  My number 605.  Thank you.  Yes, ma'am.  Ma'am.  There's some crazy people out there, ma'am.  Don't rush or anything.  Yeah, don't send them away for maybe a car wreck or something. 
[03:08:00]  Don't rush.  Send them over here and parent.  And parent for me.  You're a parent.  Bang their heads together.  I'm with you, Ant.  She's totally frustrated, man.  Bipolar.  Calling the cops.  I guarantee you she's a divorcee, too, man.  Oh, absolutely.  That dude wasn't putting up with that.  No.  Imagine that.  Husband walks home.  How you doing?  Yeah, had a hard day at work there, honey.  Oh, hard?  Not as hard as me.  I had to deal with these two.  Oh, shut up.  And she probably threatens a kid with the cops all the time and never calls them.  And they're like, ah, shut up, Paul. 
[03:08:30]  I'm calling.  Yeah, they called her, Paul.  Well, I will call 911.  You know, 911.  Somebody should just, like, put a little piece of fecal matter on her car.  I agree around her chest.  Two weeks straight.  Two weeks straight.  911 is for emergencies.  911 is not a joke.  There you go.  Thank you.  Can we get a follow-up on what happened with this guy?  Now all these radio stations are playing it.  He is cooked.  It's pretty, like, recent news.  Who's finished?  Let's find out.  Mike Forbus.  Yeah, poor Mike Forbus. 
[03:09:00]  He's got, like, huge like that, man.  I don't know.  Now he's, you know.  We should support him.  We should support him.  Because 911 is there for emergencies.  And that does not, that is not an emergency.  He said the police are out right now on an emergency call.  They'll get there when they can.  And she said that they're not fighting anymore.  Yeah.  They're not fighting.  So what?  The cops got to go over there now and give them a talk?  No, you listen to your mom.  And no fighting.  Meanwhile, there's shit going on down the road. 
[03:09:30]  There's probably some, you know.  Somebody's cat is up in a tree.  Oh, some real emergency.  Some prostitutes getting their arms broke.  He gave her a little, you know, hey, you call 911 with this crap and I'm going to joke about it.  It was so awkward, though, because he's like, do you want us to shoot him?  And she's quiet.  Look, I didn't mean that.  I'm sorry.  He felt like he could get away with the line.  That was a great line, too.  Wouldn't be a bad idea. 
[03:10:00]  You know, it wouldn't be a bad idea.  Let's go to Mike in Belmore.  Hey, I'm sorry, Paul.  I'm sorry.  Please.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean it.  It's a joke.  That's great.  That is good.  Mike has a story in Belmore.  Mike?  Hey, guys.  My wife is a counselor at a city high school.  And one of her students was having trouble with her mother.  The mother came into the school to sign the daughter out.  And before they left, the mother throttled the kid, who was 18, a sophomore.  That tells you something right there.  And just pushed her against the wall and punched her. 
[03:10:30]  And as security came, the mother was saying, I'm a 911 operator.  I didn't punch her that hard.  You can't do anything.  And the police didn't press charges or anything.  The mother hit the daughter?  Yes.  She grabbed her by the neck, slammed her against the wall, and punched her.  And the security came running.  Police came.  Because now there's police at the school, because it's one of the troubled city schools.  And the police said, yeah, the girl said she didn't want to press charges.  We can't do anything.  There's no bruising.  But, like, there were so many witnesses that saw this mother, who's a 911 operator, punch the daughter. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, but what about the events leading up to it?  I mean, like, she did punch her, but was there, like, you know?  No, my wife said that she just did a good one, Norton.  Well, there was, you know, my wife said that the mother was whispering something in her ear,  and she couldn't hear what it was, but she must have been talking a lot of shit,  because then she just shoved her against the wall and said,  you're either going home or going to the hospital.  She probably had, the daughter might have asked for it, I don't know.  That was a cool story, sir.  I wish you didn't stop in the middle of it. 
[03:11:30]  Tracy, I'm really sorry you had to hear that one.  We're usually really good on this show.  Yeah, exactly.  I apologize.  Get this guy off the phone, he's dying.  Or 411 for information.  What the fuck is he talking about?  You know how he's telling my mother to kick my ass in school?  Yeah.  Yes.  Right there in school.  Nah, come on.  Whatever I did to get it, to deserve it, I didn't do it again, so.  There you go.  That's how you learn as a kid.  You get a whack.  You don't have your mommy call 911.  That's right.  I like Belt of Scotch from Whack Bag.  Now I'm old school.  He's got it quoted. 
[03:12:00]  Do you want us to shoot her?  And then dot, dot, dot.  What?  Nothing?  Nothing?  Dude, would you misbehave?  If you were your parent, it would happen to me, I was a kid, I would mouth off, right  over my mother's lap, spanked, gets me off, wipes her leg off, I don't misbehave again.  It was done with.  But you do misbehave again, because you want that feeling again.  That's true.  A little red stingy on my backside.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal. 
[03:12:30]  Here's the scene.  Tracy Morgan in house.  You staying, Tracy?  I'm chilling.  I'm with you guys.  Love you guys.  Do you like trainable audio?  Oh, I love this.  What is that?  What is trainable audio?  Tracy, back in the late 50s, early 60s, with mentally challenged children, what they did  was train them.  Because before then, they just put them into institutions and left them there to rot.  Right.  So then in the 50s and 60s, they decided that these children can be trained, not taught.  They said not teach. 
[03:13:00]  They train them like an animal.  And they can enter society in that fashion by being trained.  And it was an early attempt at making these people productive.  At special ed in a way.  Special education.  Right.  Now, you know, there's no more retarded people.  Now it's, you know, mentally challenged and they can all become productive members of  society.  But this is pretty much the early phase of that whole thing.  And it's the old films.  The old films they used to show you in school teaching these children about sex education. 
[03:13:30]  These little retarded children.  They had a name for them.  Trainables.  They were called Trainables.  Trainable audios?  Trainables.  No, well, we have audio.  Audio of trainable films.  That's right.  Wow.  This is interesting.  Oh, it is fascinating.  Should we take a break first?  I guess they figured if you can teach a bear in Romania to tap dance with a ring through  its nose, you could teach one of these idiots to not shit in its pants.  We should take a break?  You're awful. 
[03:14:00]  We've got to take a quick break because we've got to take leaks and stuff.  That's the only reason we break on satellite radios, so we can take leaks, Tracy.  All right.  Tracy Morgan is at Caroline's all this weekend, tomorrow, Saturday, and Sunday, 2-1-2-757-4100  for ticket info.  But I think all the show's going to sell out, Tracy.  They will sell out, so call.  Yeah, call now before it's too late, right?  Yes, they will sell out.  All right.  Here's Stephen Lynch singing about special ed, and we'll continue with this audio next.  I'll do this one.  When I was a boy of ten, I had a very special friend. 
[03:14:30]  Ed was kind, with good intents, but just a little different, oh, special ed.  His mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now he's not so bright instead.  He's a little bit special, just a little bit special. 
[03:15:00]  We'd play tag, and he'd get hurt.  I'd play soldier, he'd eat dirt.  I like math and the spelling bee.  Ed liked talking to a tree, oh, special ed.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head. 
[03:15:30]  Now she keeps him in the shed.  Cause he's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special.  I ran track, hung out in malls.  Ed ran headfirst in two walls.  I had girly girls and lots of clothes.  Ed had names for all his toes. 
[03:16:00]  Like Larry and Terry and Jerry and Barry and Ronnie and Bobby and Ricky and Mike.  And if I love a girl who cares, will you like it special ed?  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now he thinks he's a piece of bread.  Cause he's a little bit special.  I thought college life was great. 
[03:16:30]  Ed could count from one to two.  I like people and the party scene.  Ed was scared of the vacuum cleaner special ed.  If mama, mama just didn't drop him on his head.  Now his favorite color is the radio.  Cause he's a little bit better. 
[03:17:00]  Just a little bit.  One day talking to special ed.  He grabbed a brick and he swung at my head.  And as he laughed at me, that's when I knew  That special ed just made me special too.  Ha!  My shoes hurt!  Now I laugh as I count bugs. 
[03:17:30]  I give strangers great big hugs.  Next to me, it is fine.  Yeah, he's a fucking Einstein.  Oh, special ed and me.  Now we're not right in the head, you see.  Now we're not so, not so bright.  Instead, we're a little bit special.  Oh, just a little bit special. 
[03:18:00]  Oh, that fuck red made me special.  Just a little bit.  Just a little bit special.  Oh, that stupid XM stinger they do. 
[03:18:30]  What is it?  XM 202.  Why did we take a break?  A whole discussion was going on while I was taking a leak, Anthony.  That needed to be on the radio.  Jim Norton and Tracy Morgan talking about fetishes. 
[03:19:00]  Tracy Morgan saying he feels sorry for people that go to their grave.  What?  Not knowing their quirks and their quarks, what turn them on, how they get off.  You know, that's why you got so many people bugging out with 911.  Because they need to get fucking laid.  Need somebody to put some sperm on your butthole.  That's my fetish.  That booty hole.  Really?  Brown eye.  Yeah, ain't nothing like female butthole, man.  It was the greatest thing God ever created.  Lord have mercy.  I'm specific where I lay my load. 
[03:19:30]  I got to come in a female eye.  Really?  I aim for the eye, yeah.  And I like, you know what my fetish is though, Jim?  I like to send my girl to the beauty salon and have her put bangs in her hair and then  come in her bangs.  Women love sperm in their bangs.  I don't say semen.  I say sperm.  Super sperm.  You ever put sperm in a chick's bangs?  I don't come in hair, no.  I prefer to come on them or in their mouth.  Women love it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I walked into this conversation, I'm like, Jimmy, what the hell's going on? 
[03:20:00]  He goes, I mean, Tracy has a lot of the same fetishes.  I fell in love with your head.  I like throat.  I fell in love with Tracy years ago.  We were talking about just eating ass.  He's like, I like to smell that booty hole.  Man, I love the way that butthole smells.  Smells good.  I'm telling you, women love it, man.  You eat, if you, I don't call it torsing salad.  I silence the lambs.  One puts the lotion in the basket.  I like to suck it until I get that moth out.  Let me tell you something. 
[03:20:30]  I eat females.  I love cunts so much, man.  I eat cunts so much, man.  Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Like, warning, warning.  Sea word alert.  Sea word alert.  Warning, warning.  He's not using that to be derogatory.  He's using that as like a proper noun.  Yeah.  Well, I like, I eat coochie so much, I eat it until I burp.  Like, I eat some Oreo cookies.  Ladies, we love you. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, hell yeah.  God is a genius, man.  They out there, too, man.  You see them?  You got to be a pure genius to come up with the concept of titties.  Hmm.  Men do seem to enjoy the titties.  Just imagine the blueprint on that.  The blueprint.  Like light skin, dark brown nipples.  I like that.  Big dark.  Yeah.  All the yellows.  Yeah, man.  I like that.  Somebody going to get it this week.  Somebody going to get pregnant.  Yeah.  I don't pull out.  I don't pull out.  Oh, from you.  I thought you meant just in general.  Somebody this week is going to get pregnant. 
[03:21:30]  Somebody just got pregnant talking, listening to the show.  Yeah, sure.  Hey, you have an update on the 911 guy?  Yes, I have an update.  That gentleman that made that little joke about come over and shoot her.  He was reprimanded, Opie.  Reprimanded.  He's a dispatcher for five years at the Watauga Department of Public Safety.  Where's that?  Washington?  Let's see where that is.  They had to reprimand him for the joke, right?  They had to reprimand him.  They had to, right? 
[03:22:00]  They did.  But they didn't fire him.  Good.  Go, go, go, go, go, go.  He got a letter.  We've been in this situation.  All right.  Tell him what happened.  He got a letter.  It says from police chief David Van Laar.  He wrote to the operator, this type of response cannot be tolerated, and this letter shall serve  as notice that any future unprofessional responses while answering the 911 line will be cause  for termination.  And we, um...  We've been there.  Know what happened with this guy?  We've gotten this same letter.  Behind closed doors, his superiors were going, hey, dude, that's really funny. 
[03:22:30]  And, you know, we understand.  We know this job sucks at times, but we've got to make it look good out there.  So we're going to give you this.  We've been through these discussions.  We're going to release this letter, you know, to calm everyone the fuck down, but let me  tell you, and pat him on the back going, dude, that was really funny.  Right.  I guarantee that's what happened.  Exactly.  You guys knew you, you guys knew you was coming back to radio, though.  Did we?  Yeah.  Really? 
[03:23:00]  That was great, man.  People listen to you guys, man.  You get us going in the morning, man.  Hey, uh, Steve brought in another complaint call.  Yes.  What?  And then we're...  Another, um, 9-1-1.  Yeah.  Another, uh, this is a woman calling the cops because of a problem she had with her Burger  King order.  Uh-oh.  What?  That's what Steve's telling me.  I'm a little worried that everything's okay.  Can you believe these people, the cops, cops, you know, I love when they go around and just  throw people beatings, use the tasers when they're not supposed to, things like that, 
[03:23:30]  because the shit they've got to put up with sometimes.  And a woman calls 9-1-1.  And, uh, somebody could be dying, but please respond to this woman who didn't, her burger  order went awry.  That's part, man.  How can I help you?  Yeah.  I'm over here, I'm over here at Burger King right here in San Clemente.  Mm-hmm.  Um, no, not San Clemente.  I'm sorry.  Um, I live in San Clemente.  I'm in Laguna Niguel, I think.  That's where I'm at.  Uh-huh.  I'm at a drive-thru right now.  Uh-huh.  I had, I ordered my food three times.  They're mopping the floor inside, and I understand they're busy.  They're not even busy.  Okay.  I've been to the only car here. 
[03:24:00]  I asked them four different times to make me a Western barbecue burger.  Okay, they keep giving me a hamburger with lettuce, tomato, and cheese, onions.  And I said, I'm not leaving.  Uh-huh.  I want a Western burger, because I just got my kids from Taekwondo.  They're hungry.  I'm on my way home, and I live in San Clemente.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  She said, she gave me another hamburger.  It's wrong.  I said, four times.  I said, I want it.  She goes, can you go out and park in front?  I said, no.  I want my hamburger right.  So then the lady came to the manager, or whoever she is.  She came up, and she said, um, she said, um, do you want your money back? 
[03:24:30]  And I said, no, I want my hamburger.  My kids are hungry, and I have to jump on that toll freeway.  I said, I am not leaving this spot.  And I said, I will call the police, because I want my Western burger done right.  Holy crap.  Can you even believe?  That people are just hopeless, pathetic people that do shit like that.  Yeah.  This woman obviously needs a life.  The way she's babbling, just babbling.  She needs an outlet.  She needs someone to talk to.  You think that's frustration?  That is an absolute, like, frustration. 
[03:25:00]  She's dealing with her little kids all day.  What?  What, Opie?  No.  She thinks her shit don't stink.  You think she's so important.  She's one of these rich bitches in a big SUV car.  San Clemente Laguna Niguel, very well-to-do area.  I disagree.  I think that when you order a burger, and you want something specifically, if it's not done,  the police should be called.  You are an ass.  She has a fine life.  Oh, my French.  But you're an asshole.  This woman has a fine life that looks down on people. 
[03:25:30]  Maybe you didn't hear specifically, oh, but she requested the burger more than once.  The Western.  She said Western barbecue.  She wanted the Western barbecue.  And they're in there mopping the floors.  Yes.  They're in there mopping the floors.  She asked four times.  That's right.  Uncircumcised, I'll bet.  And she picked a little lad up from Taekwondo, and he wanted a burger.  A Western, as Tracy pointed out.  And he's not getting the burger.  Well, there's more.  Uh-oh.  Now, is that so hard?  Okay, what exactly is it you want us to do for you?  I send an officer down here.  I want them to make me the right... 
[03:26:00]  Sam, we're not going to go down there and enforce your Western bacon cheeseburger.  Good.  What am I supposed to do?  This is between you and the manager.  We're not going to go enforce how to make a hamburger.  That's not a criminal issue.  There's nothing criminal.  So I just sit here and talk.  You need to calmly and rationally speak to the manager and figure out what to do between you.  She did come up, and I said, can I please have my Western burger?  She's a spoiled bitch.  I would so quickly tell this bitch to shut up. 
[03:26:30]  I just can't believe it, man.  I just can't believe it.  I'm listening to this.  I can't believe it that people are out there like, she...  Yeah.  Well, maybe you didn't hear that she already spoke to the manager, and she said she wanted  her Western burger, and the issue wasn't resolved.  That's what 911 is there for.  She want the cops to come and make her burger for her.  Yeah, making the burger for her.  What did she expect the cops to...  What scenario played out in this woman's head when she fantasized what would happen after 
[03:27:00]  this call?  The cops come screaming up, skidding to a stop.  Dude, she's one of those chicks that want to take somebody down.  That's it, right?  Yeah, man.  They want to take somebody down, man.  Throwing people on the floor, cuffing them.  You're going down, man.  You make that burger for this bitch.  You're going down.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  There was a breaking news last night, and Desperate Housewives didn't come on.  Please send somebody over here.  Why not?  Please.  It's a rational call. 
[03:27:30]  Desperate Housewives didn't come on last night.  We need somebody over here now.  Yes, and my father cut his finger off, but never mind that.  He's okay.  I think that the problem with all of you is that you hate women, and you're not addressing  the issue.  She asked for her burger to be done a certain way.  Shut up.  Shut up.  She picked up.  Had a hard day.  Picked the kids up from Taekwondo.  From Taekwondo.  All right.  Let's go back to the call.  There's more. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, there's more.  Of course there is.  I hope there is.  He said, I'm not dealing with it.  She walked away.  Because they're mopping the floor, and it's awful as bad, and they don't want to run.  They don't want to go through there, and, and, ma'am, then I suggest you get  your money back and go somewhere else.  This, this, this is, this is not a criminal issue.  We can't go out there and, and make them make you a cheeseburger the way you want it.  Well, that is, that, you're supposed to be here to protect me.  Well, what are we protecting you from?  Oh, man.  This woman has never been told, uh, no in her life.  You're supposed to be here to protect me. 
[03:28:30]  She's absolutely right.  Shut up.  The police are there to make things right, and she's not being protected.  Drop the mop and pick up the burger.  Drop it.  Make this woman her burger, or we'll send in the SWAT team.  Maybe you don't realize, but Burger Kings are the ones that said, have it your way.  Oh, well, now, okay.  Well, hey, now.  Now I might have to agree with Jimmy.  Did she make that up?  Now I might have to agree with Jimmy.  Not, have it our way while we avoid suds.  Have it your way. 
[03:29:00]  Suds on the floor.  That's right.  Have it your way.  Well, now you might have turned me, Jim.  What happened with the rest of the soap?  You're supposed to be here to protect me.  Well, what are we protecting you from?  A wrong cheeseburger?  No.  Is this like, is this a harmful cheeseburger or something?  I don't understand what you want us to do.  Well, just come down here.  I'm not leaving it.  No, ma'am.  I'm not sitting the deputies down there over a cheeseburger.  You need to go in there and act like an adult, and either get your money back and go home.  She's not acting like an adult herself. 
[03:29:30]  I'm sitting here in my car.  I just want them to make my kids a Western burger.  Now, this is what I suggest.  I suggest you get your money back from the manager, and you go on your way home.  Okay.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Good.  Yeah.  Nice.  Good.  Hang up on that.  I hope that operator was reprimanded.  No, Jim.  What, are we protecting you from a bad cheeseburger?  I think she understands the problems in the service industry, and I didn't like her attitude  at all.  Really?  It's not professional.  Asshole.  Look, you guys can do what you want. 
[03:30:00]  She should have sent the deputies down, and they should have dragged this woman out of  the truck, and then raped her mouth.  Just raped her mouth.  They absolutely should have sent the car down there and arrested the woman making that call  for tying up police resources.  That should be obstruction of justice.  Absolutely.  There should be some kind of penalty.  That woman should have been put in jail.  Her kids should have been taken away from her because she obviously isn't responsible  enough to have children.  And they should have had their little taekwondo uniforms ripped off while they were bodily 
[03:30:30]  searched for evidence of burger malfunctions.  Send them to Neverland.  Have Michael watch her while she sorts out her legal problems.  Just open that little yellow belt and rip down those little white taekwondo slacks.  These women are divorcees, man.  Yep.  They've got to be frustrated.  No, I think this woman, I don't think she was divorced.  I don't think there's any frustration in her personal life.  I think this woman is married.  Her husband probably knows nothing about her, doesn't care about her.  It's a loveless marriage. 
[03:31:00]  She's got the kids.  She's got some cash living down there in Laguna Niguel or San Clemente.  Nice area, Southern California.  She drives home to her big house.  She has a husband that doesn't even talk to her.  She doesn't talk to him.  So she's probably lonely.  She's spoiled rotten.  She does get everything she wants, but she doesn't get the attention that she needs.  So this was reaching out for attention and being spoiled and trying to get what she wants.  And what she should have gotten was an egg sandwich in a cell.  That crappy egg sandwich they give you. 
[03:31:30]  Right, Jimmy?  You know what that tastes like, don't you?  No, well, we had bologna when I was in the community.  Bologna?  Oh, the afternoon menu.  That's right.  I didn't know they changed that over.  But I didn't eat it because I had a log the size of Heather Mill's leg lodged in my colon.  Imagine if I take one bite of anything, I'm going to shit my pants in a jail cell.  Yeah, you don't want to be.  30 Crips.  Yeah, it was really awful.  Oh, my goodness.  30 Crips.  I don't want to be doing that.  But that woman absolutely should have been.  Isn't that amazing?  Arrested.  It's the type of woman that you just want to see somebody drink, like, five Pabst Blue Ribbons. 
[03:32:00]  Not even a good alcohol.  A bad, stinky breath.  Wow.  A real, like, I drank 11 Meister Brows and I plowed into her car with a bulldozer.  I don't know what happened, but I'm sorry that she can't move below the neck ever again.  Little bloody geese in the backseat strapped in.  That's right.  That's right.  Two yellow belts and a million questions of what could have been.  Somehow, in the wreckage, a little Barney video is still playing on the screen of the SUV. 
[03:32:30]  I love it.  I love it.  It sounds like a little skip.  Shrek 2.  Just still playing as the bloody geese are strapped safely in their seat.  The little character is still talking, no idea that there's two headless geese staring at him.  You see a little Westenburger roll across the street.  Still in its package.  That's right.  The woman is, the last thing she ever did was clutch the bag with the burger she didn't want in it.  That's it.  A couple of sudsy Mexicans try to help her out of the wreckage. 
[03:33:00]  How ironic.  They know she can't feel anything below the neck, so they squeeze her tits while she stares openly.  Like she's on succinylcholine.  Like The Exorcist 3.  Lady, we hate you.  Wow.  Just a filthy burrito breath in her face.  See?  That's the way we play out what would have happened.  They just give it a little squeeze when the police come.  Dumb voices.  Very good.  Do we have time to play some audio for Tracy? 
[03:33:30]  What do we got?  Of what, Opie?  Yo, dude, let me check that out.  The trainable thing.  Yeah, I would love to hear a little more trainable.  We're never going to get to the end of this thing.  Yeah, but it kind of pokes fun.  I like the way we stretch things over the stage.  Well, you gave the explanation.  It's basically people you could train back in the late 50s, early 60s.  Retarded children.  Retarded children they call trainables.  And here's a girl, the one from yesterday about how she has three holes.  Uh-huh.  This is going to be great, yeah.  Trying to explain to the trainable that she has actually three holes, Tracy. 
[03:34:00]  Sandy, we're going to talk again about the parts of your body, okay?  And the fact that a girl has three holes between her legs.  Three.  How many, Sandy?  Three.  Okay, now let's look at this picture, okay?  You see that?  This hole here is the hole where you make a BN.  Yes.  And it's called...  The women have three holes between their legs, 
[03:34:30]  and they're all worth more than the annoying one between her nose and chin.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  You ever seen a grown man naked?  You know that was part of the trainable video?  Well.  You like movies about gladiators.  Oh, Cindy's a three-holer.  Yes.  And it's called your Wrexham.  Yes.  Okay? 
[03:35:00]  And this hole here is the hole from which you pee when you go to the bathroom or urinate.  Yes.  What else would you use it for?  Well, that's just used to urinate.  No, it's not.  You used to menstruate, too.  No.  That's another hole, and we'll talk about that.  She's trying to teach the teacher.  The teacher's saying, no, that's where you pee from,  and she's like, yes, I'll menstruate.  No.  No.  You dummy.  Of course not.  Why am I bothering?  You menstruate out of this one, and you're just fisted. 
[03:35:30]  Just belt her in it.  Because there's three holes here.  Now, you show me what I showed you.  The M?  This is on your own screen.  No.  This is the hole you pee from.  Only three.  This is the hole you make a B M from.  Yes.  And this hole in between the two, that's called your vagina.  Yes.  And that's the hole from which you menstruate. 
[03:36:00]  Yes.  Now, you show it.  Pete, if possible, to show that the lesson is being understood.  Oh.  She's got a 33 and a third percent chance of getting it right.  I can't believe you guys found this in the archives, man.  Oh, yeah.  Well, by the way, what's...  Straight out the archives.  Hell, yeah.  Why is this even needed?  Because if you put a pad on, it covers all three holes, and you sit on the toilet, just  breathe deep, and whatever needs to come out will come out, and then you get up.  It's not a complicated issue.  You don't have to know where anything's coming from.  Exactly.  What the hell is she going to do? 
[03:36:30]  Right.  It's a Peter.  They're all centrally located.  Yeah.  What you do is you lay under the girl, and you say, all right, look, this hole will get  you 200.  If you sit something out of this hole, we'll get you 300.  And this hole will get you 400, but you need a day of preparation.  You know, so you eat right.  Hey, with that, the next clip, Anthony.  Yeah, what is this one?  Talking to a trainable who, I guess she's discovered she's sticky, and they're going to explain  what that's all about. 
[03:37:00]  Oh, man.  Maybe she's having her time.  We'll see what this is.  Let's hear.  Hey, Frank.  How come you haven't gotten up yet?  Oh, that's Frank.  Okay.  We heard that one yesterday.  This is where we left off, but Tracy has to hear it.  Okay, now we know.  The guy had a wet dream or something.  He had a wet dream.  Oh, he stumbled across it.  So now, like...  He woke up, and he had something in his sheets.  Right.  The guy is going to be sympathetic.  So now this creepy old guy is going to explain what the hell it was all about.  In creepy 50s fashion.  Yeah.  Hey, Frank.  How come you haven't gotten up yet? 
[03:37:30]  I'm waiting for 50.  I haven't gotten up because my fat Dominican wife told me to lay here.  He just said it because I'm sticky?  Yeah.  I'm sticky.  Hey, Frank.  How come you haven't gotten up yet?  I'm waiting for 50.  Oh.  Wet and sticky.  What, uh...  When did that happen?  Did that happen during the night?  Jesus.  Or did it just happen now?  Do you know?  Fucking Voss is a better actor than this guy.  He's awful.  When do you think it happened, Stilbert? 
[03:38:00]  When you walked in the door?  You think your pizzazz and charisma caused him a...  To bust?  To bust?  To bust?  Blat and sticky.  Well, let's clean that up.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You know?  No.  Well, if you're sticky, maybe it was a wet dream.  Do you know what a wet dream is?  No.  It's when extreme comes and plays in your room.  You must be about...  I'll bet you're the kind of guy that would fuck a person in the ass  and not even have the goddamn common courtesy to give him a reach around. 
[03:38:30]  The counselor shows a calm, accepting approach to this boy  who has just had a wet dream.  There is no scolding or recrimination.  The boy is not frightened,  and there is no reason for him to feel guilty.  Frank, I'm sure you understand now just what happened  and that this is probably going to happen quite a few times more.  Like it does to everybody else.  It's quite normal, right?  I think the best thing we can do now is to show you how to clean it up. 
[03:39:00]  Okay?  Okay.  Your days are finger-banging.  Old Mary Jane Ruttstotts  through her pretty pink panties are over.  The counselor should have really made him feel bad  and said,  the next time this happens,  find a small baby and pinch his nose shut.  I'm wet and sticky. 
[03:39:30]  Well, no shit.  Oh, Frank is as dumb as a bag of rice.  Guide these people through their lives.  Oh, my God.  What is he ever going to do around an office?  He came in his bed and just laid in it.  How worthwhile is he to have around?  Where's those reports?  Ehhh!  Oh, shit.  I've got to ship him off for scientific testing. 
[03:40:00]  What happens when he cut a foot off with no anesthesia?  Just laying it, stupid.  I can see if he got up and cleaned the load  and was a little confused,  but he fucking laid in it  until an older gentleman walked in the room.  Ah, I'm Vicky.  Ah.  You really are dumb, Frank.  I can wipe it off and get on with things.  Hey, you little maggot!  You make me want to vomit!  Oh, shit. 
[03:40:30]  What is he possibly going to contribute to society?  Nothing.  Oh, God damn.  I'm wet and sticky.  I can't believe that.  I'm going to see your war face.  Sir, you've got a war face?  Ah!  You know how Frank should have been cleaned up?  His hands should have been tied behind his back  and then a nice bath in the deep end of a pool.  That's how Frank should have been cleaned up.  There you go.  When your face hits the drain,  then your pee-pee will be all clean.  Stupid. 
[03:41:00]  Come on, the chicks with the three holes need to get together.  This is where a PM comes out.  Wow.  So wet and sticky.  All right, we got another?  Well, we're running out of show.  Damn it!  I heard those.  We'll have to do it tomorrow.  We'll hear a new one.  I never in my life heard anything like that.  No.  That's crazy.  We have four clips left.  We could tape it after the show ends and just play it tomorrow.  Why tape it?  I'm going home.  Maybe because we'll do it with Tracy or something.  Tracy's got to hear this audio.  Have you seen 57th Street? 
[03:41:30]  All these cops all over.  I am out.  Yeah, I've got to get out of here, man.  By the way, Tracy Morgan, tomorrow through Sunday, Caroline will sell out, 212-757-4100.  Thanks, Jimbo.  No, the shows will all sell.  It's one Thursday, what, two Friday, two Saturday, one Sunday.  Can I go Friday, Tracy?  Oh, you can come any time you want to, brother.  I'll be there Friday.  My friends.  My friends.  My friends.  Tracy Morgan, yes.  You're my friends.  Hilarious comedian.  All right, well, I guess we do have to end the show then.  Damn.  Someone wanted to ask if Tracy Morgan's into crime scene sex. 
[03:42:00]  Crime scene sex.  It's like when the girl's having her time and it ends up, you know, the bed looks a little  like you should have the police tape around it.  Oh, you mean like the period and stuff?  Yeah.  It gets a little messy.  Come on, man.  I run red lights all the time.  Ah, there you go.  You know me, I don't mind a little ketchup on my Frank, baby.  I'm a weedy-beedy bing-bong freak.  Take me out to the ball game.  Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.  I hear ya.  I run a red light.  He runs a red light.  I've never heard it called that before. 
[03:42:30]  Some people get a little upset at that.  Yeah, I run red lights.  Yeah.  Jimmy don't like that at all.  No, I'm not about blood.  If you get a log coming out, I'm not going to judge you.  We're not going to judge you.  My blood, man.  I can't have it.  Well, you know, that's lubrication.  Oh, God.  I'm like a Jamaican.  I won't even allow them to prepare my meals when she's on her period.  Not really.  Oh, Jamaican men don't care for the rag at all.  You know, sleep on the floor, bitch.  Yeah, I love Jamaicans.  A little, what do you call that?  The blue cheese, the ranch dressing. 
[03:43:00]  You know, I like when it's nice and gushy and you put it in and it makes that fart sound.  Oh, God, no.  Not when it's red like that, though.  When it's red.  No, not when it's wet, you know.  That's dope.  I don't like the dry stuff.  You know, you got to use monistat and all that other crazy stuff.  All right, with that, we want to thank Tracy Morgan for stopping by.  Caroline's all weekend long.  Jackson, I'm out of here. </pre>
