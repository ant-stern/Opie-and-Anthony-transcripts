<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of their self-produced "Stone Cold E.T." video, a White Castle drive-thru skit featuring an E.T. mask-wearing individual delivering a Stone Cold Steve Austin-style promo.  The hosts lamented the video's slow viral spread.  This transitioned into a discussion about Hulk Hogan's sex tape with Bubba the Love Sponge's wife, speculating on Bubba's potential involvement and the legal fallout, alongside recounting a brief, unusual encounter with Hogan in a bathroom.  The conversation then veered to CM Punk punching a fan at a WWE event (with debate on its staging) and Pete Townsend's upcoming tell-all book.  Political commentary ensued, focusing on the backlash Stacey Dash received for endorsing Mitt Romney, leading to a debate about hypocrisy in the demand for inclusivity and the overt versus covert nature of racism in different political groups. The segment concluded with outrage over a Portland school principal claiming peanut butter and jelly sandwiches represent "white privilege," and a subsequent digression into the hostsâ€™ personal bread preferences.

The show continued with a discussion about the increasing inclusivity in schools, questioning the appropriateness of participation trophies and father-son events in diverse family structures, punctuated by a humorous anecdote about Opie's hungover father and a particularly pungent fart during a father-son breakfast.  An initial misunderstanding about a school's cultural awareness program using peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as an example, initially perceived as a ban, was clarified by a caller, Megan, a teacher. This led to a sexually charged and vulgar conversation with Megan. A subsequent call from Bill in Philly detailed the cancellation of a father-daughter/mother-son dance due to potential lawsuits.  The hosts expressed frustration with what they saw as excessive sensitivity.  The show then previewed the upcoming "Jacktober" segment, expressing concerns about its repetitive nature, and announced that Jim Brewer and Johnny Rotten (John Lydon) would be guests.  Extensive discussion followed about the challenges of interviewing Johnny Rotten, his potential temperament, and their need for careful preparation. Henry Winkler and Joni Mitchell were also briefly mentioned.  "Jacktober" then proceeded, featuring clips from a Rhode Island morning show with a "Facebook vest" and a *Titanic*-themed bit, provoking sexually suggestive and vulgar jokes from the hosts.  A screen test from another station with a $10 Subway gift card as a prize further fueled their vulgar humor.  A past interview with Rick Springfield and the movie *Boogie Nights* were also briefly mentioned.


Jim Brewer joined the show in studio.  The ensuing conversation covered childhood musical tastes, ranging from country music to punk rock, with a humorous anecdote about a homeless man who allegedly performed oral sex on Barry Manilow. Brewer then shared his bizarre experience opening for Metallica in Canada, where his five-minute slot unexpectedly stretched to forty minutes.  The conversation shifted to Brewer's personal life, specifically the challenges of caring for his aging parents and a particularly distressing incident involving a negligent nurse.  This segment concluded with a live studio interview with Johnny Rotten (John Lydon).  The interview covered Lydon's career, his views on the music industry and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, his experiences with taxes, his health, his outlook on life, and his outspokenness.  Lydon used profanity throughout the interview.


The final segment further explored the interview with John Lydon (Johnny Rotten), covering his current music tour (New York and Boston dates), his thoughts on America, his marriage and family (including grandchildren), his views on the Sex Pistols' image versus their music, his wife's musical tastes, and his lack of social media presence. He shared his views on passive resistance, his philosophical alignment with Gandhi, his dislike of political extremism, and the inadequacies of the current education system.  Humorous moments included Lydon's initial confusion of Opie's assistant for Jim Brewer, jokes about Adele's weight, and reminiscing about Alice Cooper and the Beatles.  The hosts frequently used vulgar language. Later, Jim Brewer rejoined the conversation, and the hosts shared a funny video clip. The show ended with promotion of Lydon's tour and Brewer's comedy shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  We're leaving the station?  Yeah, yo!  Trying to think of some noises. 
[00:00:30]  Good morning, everyone.  Morning.  I don't like saying good morning.  No?  No, because it's weird.  Why?  Because I don't know who we're talking to.  After all these years, I have no idea.  It's the people in this microphone.  Good morning to you.  Hi, good morning.  I already said good morning when I came in the studio.  Good morning to you.  To you and yours.  The person who thinks they know us because they listen to our voices.  Ha! Ha!  The voices! 
[00:01:00]  Some people are all happy right now.  Go!  Well, there they are.  There's my morning ritual.  I just do this every day.  It's what I'm used to.  I gotta tell you, I was telling the guys before the show, that Stone Cold E.T.  It's just hilarious.  Fuck!  Watched it ten times.  It's just so funny.  Sometimes it's the dumbest, simplest thing that gets you going, right?  My favorite part of it now, because I get little parts of it that are my favorite, is  when he's sprinkling, he gets talking about the onions that he wants on his cheeseburger, 
[00:01:30]  and he makes his hand motion like he's sprinkling things into his burger.  Yeah.  It's on our Facebook page, right, Iraq, for the people that haven't seen it yet?  Yes, it is.  That fucking thing is gonna go viral.  It's only got like, it had a quarter million yesterday, and it only added like maybe 30,000.  It squeezed 30,000, 40,000 overnight.  Overnight.  It's a new video, though.  It takes a little time, right?  Is this the only place it's posted, too?  It's not like anywhere else huge, right? 
[00:02:00]  It'll start moving around.  Huh?  It hasn't, yeah.  It's been very strange, because it's been sort of scattered throughout Twitter and stuff.  No, it's...  But it's been up for almost a month.  Yeah.  It's building.  It hasn't hit yet.  No, it's building.  This thing will be very, will do very well.  I like when she says to, you know, drive to the next window, and because he has his E.T.  mask on, he can't really see.  He can't see.  He can't see his gear shift.  Yeah.  So he looks, he like, awkwardly looks down, has to stretch his face to see through the, 
[00:02:30]  wherever the fucking eye holes are.  And E.T. head goes straight down, like, to look at the shifter.  And then you see these creepy E.T. eyes as the car is flying forward to the next window.  Fucking.  It's so stupid.  It is stupid and hilarious.  That is funny, though.  It really is funny.  Is that what, like, I don't, I didn't watch Stone Cold.  That's kind of what he did, right?  Oh, that's a great impression.  That's a great impression.  Bottom line.  It's really right on.  He says, that's the bottom line. 
[00:03:00]  Open a can of whoop-ass.  What?  What?  What?  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah.  He's got all the fucking catchphrases.  Can we, can you humor me and play a little bit of this?  He's got a bunch of other ones that are just not as good.  Yeah, because they're too long.  I was telling Anthony, this idiot, I would love to talk to him.  Quick videos.  How long are they?  Because he does, he has an Ultimate Warrior one that's 12 minutes long.  I watched the first couple minutes.  I'm like, you know, if you edited this down, it probably would be pretty good.  Yeah.  As E.T. or as a different character?  As the Ultimate Warrior.  He does a few of them. 
[00:03:30]  Warrior.  Wait, who is the warrior?  What character is the warrior?  He's just doing the warrior.  Oh, it's just him.  Yeah, yeah.  But, I mean, this is the one.  Yeah, that's why it's funny, because it's got the E.T. mask.  Right.  Doesn't make sense.  Can you play a little bit of this?  Doesn't make sense.  Could I?  Would I?  This is Stone Cold E.T., and I just want to order a couple of White Castle to go.  Oh, buddy, can you repeat that again?  I said Stone Cold E.T. would like a couple of cheeseburgers, 
[00:04:00]  and maybe I'll drink, and I'd like to get out of here as soon as possible,  and that's the bomb line.  Hey, do you want to come up?  I can understand anything you're saying.  Okay, you want Stone Cold E.T.  You're going for what's up?  The little face.  Okay.  Watch, watch.  He can't see the fucking face.  He's got to look out.  Look at the eyes.  Look at his eyes as the car's flying forward.  He fucking, the whole head goes straight down. 
[00:04:30]  Because he's got to see through, like, where his eyebrows are or something.  I don't know.  That's funny.  For saying something.  Oh, God.  And now he's to the next window.  This is Stone Cold E.T., and I want to order a couple of cheeseburgers.  Cheeseburgers.  And what's the bomb line?  Because, you know, Stone Cold E.T. likes to come to White Castle or a couple of cheeseburgers  to fill me up before I whoop some ass.  Give me a hell yeah if you're bound with Stone Cold E.T. 
[00:05:00]  And he doesn't let the girl talk.  He doesn't let the girl talk.  Because Stone Cold E.T. likes whooping ass.  When Stone Cold E.T. rides a bicycle, I ride a long, I ride a hard, just like the Texas  Ralph's name, when he's done whooping Vince McMahon's ass.  Give me a, oh, hell yeah.  What'd you say, E.T.?  What?  What'd you say, E.T.?  What? 
[00:05:30]  I said, I want a one of two cheeseburgers, and that's the bottom line.  Because they're a stone called Little White Castle Burger with a little onion.  With a little meat on it, because you look like Stone Cold Steve Austin, eating those  Little White Castle burgers.  See, you know Stone Cold, like a Little White Castle action.  Well, I'm busy fighting off aliens when I'm busy beating the crap out of Will Smith in  Independence Day or beating him up in I-Robot, Stone Cold E.T. is gonna whoop some ass. 
[00:06:00]  Give me a hell yeah.  Oh, hell yeah.  Stone Cold E.T. is gonna look good, man.  And that's the bottom line.  Hell yeah.  He just drives away.  He drives away.  With his E.T. face on.  I would love to have you got T-boned because he can't see.  It's a fucking wreck.  It's a perfect Stone Cold promo.  It really is. 
[00:06:30]  It's great.  You think Stone Cold, he must have probably seen this and loves it.  I hope so.  He already loves it.  Is it on our Facebook page because people are bitching to E-Rock?  Yes, it is.  I moved it back up to the top.  Oh, moved it back to the top.  E-Rock's a little testy today.  Very nice.  Yes, it is.  Very nice.  And that's the bottom line.  Yeah.  Stone Cold E-Rock.  Oh, hell yeah.  What's this CM Punk punches a fan at the end of WWE Raw? 
[00:07:00]  Is this the video that the guy on Twitter sent me probably 200 times?  I blocked it.  I had to block him.  He's spamming his stupid video.  People are dumb.  I see your tweets.  Stop.  Tweet?  You blocked him too?  Yeah, I had to block him because while the show was on, he just kept every little or every second.  Was it for this video?  Yeah.  Well, talk about it.  Give us a second.  What's the video?  Why are we doing a wrestling break?  Yeah, right?  I mean, CM Punk punched a guy in the face and some guy dressed up as E.T. pretending to be Stone Cold. 
[00:07:30]  And Hulk.  It's a great wrestling day.  With that fucking weirdo Bubba with a love sponge.  What a ghoul.  Bubba's always been a strange dude.  If he wants to call the show and talk about this, I'm more than willing to talk.  Oh, boy.  But what the fuck?  Set up his friend Hulk Hogan?  What the hell is that about?  I don't know.  What do you think that's about?  Obviously, they're swingers.  And, you know, we all know swingers and shit. 
[00:08:00]  Sex tape E.T.  What to set up your friend like that?  What the fuck's that about, Bubba?  That's bizarre.  Did your relationship with Hulk go bad and now you had this tape laying around?  Well, I want to know the details.  He's just a weird fuck.  Bubba's a weird fuck.  I'm sorry.  I could never watch a friend.  Like, I wouldn't even like to watch a stranger fuck my chick, but a friend is too weird.  Like, a friend really would freak me out.  A stranger.  Then you could see, like, pornography at least.  Well, but then he's, like, secretly taping as people, I would assume people, I don't know. 
[00:08:30]  Let's keep it with Hulk, I guess.  While Hulk is fucking your wife?  What is that about?  So he could jerk off later?  What's that about, Bubba?  Tell me.  That's just fucking weird.  Are you kind of a cuckold, but you don't want to be in the room and this is the second best thing?  A cuck.  Where you film this shit and then when everyone goes home, you get to, you know, whack your bag to it?  Oh, boy.  Or he's just a huge wrestling fan.  Oh, man.  That's a big wrestling fan.  He just really wants to see Hulk Hogan fucking, even if it's his wife. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, God.  Yeah, Bubba's always been a weird dude.  Oh.  Never officially met him, but just.  That's weird.  Just over the years.  Just a strange, strange dude.  Didn't he talk about that, too, and say, yeah, I like to let my friends bang my wife?  He said that, right?  Apparently.  Apparently.  I know there's people that are into that.  Fine.  We're open-minded around here.  Fine if that's what you're into, but to fucking tape it and set up someone that supposedly is a good friend of yours, that's where it's fucked up.  Yeah, did you hear what he said at the end of the tape?  Did you see the whole tape?  No, no, no, no. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, okay.  They just, TMZ saw it and TMZ said what he said.  At the end of the tape, after Hogan leaves the room, he goes in, because before he said he didn't know it was being filmed, but at the end of the tape, he goes into his wife and goes, man, if we ever want to retire,  we got this.  And his wife is going, what?  You'd never do that.  No, no, I remember.  So how did the tape get out there?  Yeah, why would he leave that part in?  So obviously, two people know about this tape.  Yeah.  At the time. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, him and his wife, his ex-wife now know about this tape.  Is he going to try to claim someone stole his tape, that bullshit?  That old gag.  It is weird that he would leave that kind of damaging quote in.  Yeah, like, you know what?  I bet he had, this is a guess.  I would guess he had showed it to people, because it's like, if you're a swinger, and you and your wife bang different people,  if Hulk fucks your chick, that's a big one.  Maybe he showed that to another friend who's a swinger or someone, and someone took that.  And maybe that just happened to be on the end, and he never...  Because why would you leave that part?  Right.  Where you sound like kind of a dick doing that. 
[00:10:30]  Right.  You'd take that out.  Do you think Hulk is still his friend?  Well, he was.  I mean, he said yesterday he still was, but then...  He didn't say it on our show, though.  He didn't know.  No.  Right now.  We saw him in the bathroom, though.  Said hi to him in the bathroom.  Did you talk to him in there?  I said hi.  Just said hi.  I took a tinkle in.  I want to say, remember when you used to do our show?  You was pissing out of that big thermos?  Yeah, why didn't you ask him?  He probably wouldn't have known you.  Might be a publicist thing.  Because honestly, I don't care enough.  Oh, I'd love to have him on.  Yeah.  I don't care enough.  Let him be a baby. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah.  Whatever the problem is.  He used to do our show and have a good time.  Yeah, I don't know what it is.  But apparently it's like a criminal offense in Florida to record people while they're having  sex without their knowledge.  Oh, yeah?  So if Bubba on the tape says, oh, I can retire on this, then he must have known it was recording.  Right.  And if Hogan really didn't know, you would think that would mean Bubba could be in trouble  for that.  Yeah, maybe.  So where's the audio of Hulk talking about this?  I'll give you the CD.  That's him talking to TMZ Live, called into TMZ, because they're the ones who saw the 
[00:11:30]  whole tape.  All right.  Bubba or Hulk called in?  Hulk called in.  Do they all have their coffee drinks with their big straws?  Yeah, where they all laugh and leaning over the thing?  Right.  In their cubicles and chairs.  I'd like that show for two days.  Do you know TMZ is really, like, they...  We kind of know some TMZ guys, so I should shut up.  No, but they're cool guys.  And what they do is...  I heard a lot of times...  The guys that collect this stuff are very cool, but it's just the coffee-drinking douche.  The presentation of it.  Harvey.  Harvey! 
[00:12:00]  Harvey.  A lot of times I heard, if you don't want to talk, they really won't bother you.  Like, most times they talk to people, the people want to talk to them.  Yeah.  Yeah, that they're...  It's not as sabotaging as it seems sometimes.  Harvey Levin just doesn't present it right because he smiles too much.  Yeah.  Oh, because he loves it.  I hate it.  He loves getting into it.  Where's Doug Llewellyn, pal?  He loves everyone's dirty laundry.  He just bathes in dirty laundry.  He loves it.  He sniffs dirty laundry.  Oh, yeah.  Can't get enough of it.  He eats, shits, and breathes dirty laundry.  Right.  He loves it. 
[00:12:30]  Gets that big fucking iced coffee drink with a straw.  Sips away as he gets into everyone's dirty laundry.  Yeah, I bet you he wakes up every day and goes,  Ooh, there's going to be some good invasions of privacy today.  Yeah, it's going to dish some dirt today.  Hopefully we get a racing stripe today.  A nice dark racing stripe.  Maybe some period blood in the laundry.  Nice filthy laundry.  Fucking ghoul.  He was the illegal consultant on the People's Court.  Yeah, on the People's Court. 
[00:13:00]  He still does it.  Does he really?  Yeah, he still goes out on the street and talks to the idiots.  We had him on once, and I talked about how I really liked his show because he's not bullshitting.  He's basically saying, yeah, we're kind of dickbags, and here we are.  We're exposing celebrities.  And then he had to go, no, that's not what we do at all.  We're dickbags.  Shut up.  We're not doing that at all.  It is what you're doing, Harvey.  Of course it is.  So Hulk was on TMZ Live. 
[00:13:30]  What is that, a podcast they do or something?  That's their web show.  Their web show?  Yeah.  This is the end of the tape.  You leave, and Bubba comes back in the room, and Heather's on the bed.  And Bubba says, I quote, if we ever did want to retire, all we'd have to do is use this footage of him.  Oh, wow.  So I just kind of want your reaction to that.  I know you know that this might be in one of the tapes.  I can tell you 100%.  That is what Bubba says when you leave the room. 
[00:14:00]  If that is true, I'm sick to my stomach right now.  Oh, boy.  Because I have gone over this with Bubba, and I don't know why someone would secretly film this.  And when this first popped up, you know, six or seven months ago, you know, it was something I was praying would go away simply because I'm accountable for it.  Sex tapes never go away.  You know, it happened way before I met my current wife, Jennifer, and I was at an all-time low. 
[00:14:30]  I pretty much bottomed out, to tell you the truth.  Bottomed out in that woman's pussy.  You know, with the marriage I had, and I was, you know, at an all-time low, and I made a bad choice.  Oh, stop.  Oh, you didn't make a bad choice.  Don't lie.  Come on.  Shut up.  Shut up.  These people are idiots.  Another conquest that you got under your belt.  You made a bad choice.  You don't believe that.  It's not a bad choice.  You were fucking.  What are you going to worry about?  Your marriage broke up.  You were single, and this is what you were doing at the time. 
[00:15:00]  It wasn't a bad choice.  God, people are just jerks.  Maybe the fucker there was the bad choice.  Maybe you should always go to your own space.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  But I think he's meaning a bad choice.  Maybe he meant leg-dropping the towers.  But he did it for us.  He did.  Let's remember that, people.  I don't know why you're running away.  I know.  The Hulk was very shocked, because he was doing it for you.  He peeked around the corner there.  Can I see that?  Of course you can. 
[00:15:30]  That should just always be.  That should be on the desktop.  Yeah.  Hey, where are you people going?  Dun, dun, dun, dun.  He's hitting the towers with a chair.  That's probably my favorite one, is the fact that he's hitting them with a chair and a chicken.  What are the other ones?  Then he drop kicks one.  The leg drops.  Yeah.  Now he's pointing at the pile, just smoking, poking up.  And then he's doing that, can you hear me, shit?  Yeah.  Or he's listening for the reaction. 
[00:16:00]  My favorite is the second to last one.  Yeah, he's striking his little pose.  He's in the rubble of the World Trade Center, and he's celebrating, expecting the cheers.  And that's why, and then the last one, he looks around the corner like, what the fuck?  Where are you guys running off to?  I did this for you.  I'm expecting adulation.  I just knocked down the World Trade Center.  The Hulkster.  Jesus.  Look, man, it's not funny to make fun of the towers being knocked down, all right?  It's funny to make fun of Hulk, though.  Yeah, but imagine if Giant Hulk Hogan did it. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Giant Hulk Hogan.  And then another clip from Hulk Hogan on this TMZ Live.  Hulk Hogan, did he ever admit to you that he taped you while you were in his room?  No, I've asked him.  I've asked him.  I said, Bubba, you are my friend.  And I've said this to him a few days ago.  Oh, boy.  And I still stand by this.  That, Bubba, you are my friend.  And you're one of the only real friends I have in my life. 
[00:17:00]  I value your friendship.  Oh, man.  And...  Wow, you must be a shitty person.  That's the only friend you got in your life?  That's pretty pathetic.  What about Sly?  He's not friends with Sly?  He was in a rookie, you know.  A rookie or two.  That's a ruffler, man, to be fucking that close to somebody and they...  Oh, they fuck you over like that.  Like, you're as comfortable there as you are at your own house.  Oh, and then you get fucked over like that.  I value your friendship.  And whoever did this to me, filled me secretly, whoever leaked this tape.  I don't know what the motive is, if it's just trying to destroy me or if they're trying to make money. 
[00:17:30]  But if you had anything to do with this, that meant we were never friends.  And that, you know, I love you to death and I know you have a family.  And that if you did this, you need to tell me now.  So what?  Are you still friends with Bubba?  I think he's still trying to figure out what happened.  He has to say what happened.  Bubba had a pretty good radio career.  It's been fading away slowly but surely. 
[00:18:00]  He was here at SiriusXM for a while, wasn't he?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  For a year or so.  No, he was here for a couple of years.  Oh, and then he went on to internet radio, which is not happening yet.  No.  So I bet you he's thinking to himself, I got this fucking tape, man.  I could fucking get some headlines right about now.  Yep.  Wow.  I miss those fucking headlines and people talking about me.  But it's more so Hulk that's getting the headlines.  Right.  I know.  He's kind of a peripheral.  Unless, you know what?  If he left it on there on purpose and if Bubba did release this, maybe that's why he left it on. 
[00:18:30]  More footage of him.  Of course.  Tied into it.  Of course.  Wow.  It's also weird that it's coming out while Hulk Hogan has something to promote.  What is he promoting?  He was already on the schedule to do shows.  For what?  What is he promoting?  He's promoting the TNA pay-per-view.  Oh.  Who cares?  That's just it.  Who cares?  That's in a TV studio or something, isn't it?  Now people care.  Yeah.  That's why he's doing press, though.  I don't know.  It's just weird that it came out right now.  You think this might be a work that everyone's in on it? 
[00:19:00]  It'd be tough to imagine that, but it's a weird coincidence.  Nah.  I'll tell you why.  Because I don't think Hulk would want the world to see him all fucking naked and shit.  Or to see him answering that cell phone.  Yeah.  Or to say, I'm fat.  I ate like a pig.  If that was legit, there's certain things he wouldn't have done.  What are you talking about?  Like if that, like the things he said.  That's in the tape?  Yeah.  Did you see the clip?  No.  You didn't see the, there's a clip.  I couldn't be bothered with this one.  There's a clip.  Oh.  But he, uh, he says a couple of things that wouldn't happen. 
[00:19:30]  I didn't see the clip.  Yeah.  It's all over.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Hulk Hogan, a sex tape clip.  I was too busy watching Stone Cold E.T.  Stone Cold E.T.  And people are still saying there's no Stone Cold E.T. on the Facebook page.  E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Everyone's a fucking idiot.  Oh.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Nice.  Those are our fans.  Yeah.  Let's treat them with kid gloves.  Respect.  Sure.  Yeah.  Let me see this. 
[00:20:00]  Mystery man.  Wait.  Go back.  Who's the mystery man and what do they say?  That's Bubba.  Saying I'll be in my office if you need me.  Saying like, hey, you fuck my wife.  I'm going to go do some more.  You know, I know people do this.  I don't know how you do this.  Oh, my.  I'll bet you Bubba was watching.  You leave your naked wife on a bed and you go, I'll be in another room for a while.  With naked Hulk right there.  Naked tan lines.  Ready to fuck.  Like his buns.  But that does, buns of steel.  That does explain, if Bubba released it, that does explain why he's on the end. 
[00:20:30]  Because he's not on this part right here.  It's only his voice.  Unless he's in the beginning of it.  All right.  Play that.  Mystery man off camera.  All right.  Listen.  You guys do your thing.  Jesus.  You guys do your thing.  Somebody do it.  I'll be in one of the feet.  I can't believe I should be home now.  I'm here.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Hulk's just getting his dick sucked.  Oh, boy.  Let me see.  That's Nick.  Hold on.  The phone rings.  And the ringtone is Brooke Hogan's song. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy.  How awkward.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's a...  They put the little musical notes up sometimes.  Yeah, Hulk never would have left this in if that was a work.  Oh, Hulk's getting his dick sucked.  Oh, yeah.  How hot is that, though?  Look at his mule.  Jesus, Hulk.  She's enjoying it.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:21:30]  Get your clothes and get out.  I'm gone.  He's wearing a Bubba's t-shirt.  Can't believe I was just eating like a pig ten minutes ago.  So I know how long he fucked for.  Yeah, I'm a fucking roller coaster.  I'm out of breath.  Oh, no.  He's in his office.  Could chill out for him for a minute.  I'm going to run home.  It's supposed to be Nick at midnight.  My phone rings tonight, right?  She goes, this is Heather.  I'm so-and-so's twin sister.  She says to me, she goes, 
[00:22:00]  Nick says, you know, I forget the divorce.  Is that true?  I said, well, I don't know.  She goes, well, if you're hitting the horse,  I want to be the first one to go out with you.  The girl at Nick's date and her twin sister said that to me.  I thought, I don't know how the fuck you got my number.  You're a hot kamazi.  Yeah, right?  I don't know.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I love Hulk's yap as I get dressed banter. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, his little banter.  His get the fuck out banter.  Yeah, yeah.  Holy shit.  That's fucked up shit right there.  It's weird.  I don't understand that world.  Yeah.  He was still married, too.  Yeah, it sounds like you, right?  I wonder if that's...  I don't know if it'll hurt him or not, but I wonder.  I think that's over.  Yeah.  I don't know if he signed anything that said anything.  Linda Hogan pretty much fucking destroyed him.  I think he might have admitted to cheating, too.  At the end.  Wow.  That's some fucked up shit right there. 
[00:23:00]  It's fucked up, right?  It's crazy.  All right.  Yeah, thank you.  He's like, thank you.  Thank you.  I'm leaving now.  You're awesome.  So are you.  Take my big dick that was just in your mouth and I'm going to go home.  And your pussy.  At least it was big, though.  The only problem I have is that, you know, Bubba could have set his pal up like that.  Yeah.  Unless it's a work.  I don't know.  Is it a work?  No way.  You don't leave the phone call thinking, talk about your son or that stuff.  None of that stuff would stay in. 
[00:23:30]  Mentions of his ex-wife.  It's a scumbag move.  The whole thing is really weird.  Unless it was swiped.  I mean, unless he showed people, fucking snatched it one time.  Or his wife had a copy and she gave it.  Because it's his ex-wife now.  So his ex-wife could have had a copy and given it to somebody.  Right.  Or they just took it from her.  Or maybe it's Bubba.  You know?  So maybe she got it out there.  Yeah.  Maybe literally that was just something he would jerk off to.  Yeah.  And then maybe she got it stolen from her. 
[00:24:00]  Maybe she had it and fucking showed somebody.  Or whatever.  Who knows?  I don't usually believe in sex taste being stolen, but.  Yeah, I know.  There's a couple things on this one that make you like, eh.  It's damaging.  Yeah, why would they leave that in there?  That just makes him look bad.  I would have suspected Macho Man Randy Savage, but he couldn't have done it this time.  And Stone Cold E.T., where was he?  Where was Stone Cold E.T.?  Well, he's a White Castle, actually.  He's getting a little cheeseburger before he beats Vince McMahon's ass. 
[00:24:30]  Cheeseburger.  I'm sure we'll find out more about this in the coming days.  Yeah.  What's up with CM Punk to finish up our dumb wrestling break?  Well, he punched a fan in the face.  Wow.  Is it fake?  No.  What?  No.  Is he going to be in trouble?  I don't know.  He went in the crowd.  He fought Vince McMahon, which he fought Vince McMahon on Raw.  Right.  And then he got, he was running away from a guy named Ryback.  Right.  Jumped in the crowd to get away from him. 
[00:25:00]  But he's a heel now.  So he's been, you know, instigating things with the fans as of late.  So they were all kind of shoving him while he was in the crowd.  And he was kind of like, had to swat him off him.  And some guy kept pushing him from behind.  You don't want to do that.  And he pushed him twice.  And Punk didn't know who it was.  So the third time, you'll see in the video, some guy just reached up and kind of knocks  him in the back of the head.  And Punk turned around and punched him in the face.  Oh, shit.  Shoved him and punched him in the face.  So he could finish his promo with Vince.  What is this landscape mode shit? 
[00:25:30]  I know.  I'm in portrait mode.  A lot of people still do that.  They're idiots.  Morons.  I instantly, don't you automatically just turn your fucking phone sideways?  Sideways is the best way.  Oh, my God.  Not even a question.  It's so stupid to hold your phone straight up and down like an idiot.  Why can't the phone figure that out?  Yeah, why can't exactly?  Why can't the phone go, oh, okay, you're a dummy.  I'm going to film it the right way for you.  Should be an option.  I'm serious.  Yeah.  Well, if it was an option, people wouldn't fucking even know how to turn it on.  So, you know, well, what if you wanted it in portrait mode? 
[00:26:00]  Do you have a hard time even watching those videos?  Like, it's like, it fucks with your brain.  It's annoying.  You're not supposed to see things in that aspect.  Yeah, because your brain at this point knows there should be more on the screen.  Yeah, on the sides.  Yeah, hit that.  So, you get shoved.  Shoved.  So, you get shoved twice.  And he looks back.  And then that guy knocks him in the head of both. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Oh, nice.  That's got to hurt.  Nice.  Nah, he'll be all right.  And then what happened?  And then he continued, you know, and then acted like nothing had happened.  Nah, he's fine.  He kind of bitch slapped the guy.  Yeah, and then he turned around and belted him, though.  He broke his glasses.  Did he?  Good.  Yeah.  Fucking dummy poking at him.  Yeah.  He's a wrestler.  Like, he could beat you up.  Yeah, we think he's not a man because he's fucking got a belt in his hand?  Good.  Just saw on the screen that Pete Townsend is doing a tell-all book.  Is he going to talk about that little incident he had? 
[00:27:00]  I hope so.  And what really was going on?  The book is called Best Excuse Maker Ever.  Because it said he dishes on his bandmates.  Yes.  But is he going to, like, tell the story about how he got caught with kiddie porn and what  the real reason was?  I hope so.  He got away with that one, huh?  Oh, yeah.  So he skated.  I believe.  Yeah, I think so, too.  Saying it was research for a book.  Here's the book.  Let's see.  Yeah, here's the book.  Maybe it was for this book. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  The book is called Thinking on Your Feet.  How to come up with viable excuses in uncomfortable situations.  Oh, it was researching.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was his excuse, right?  Yes.  He was researching a book.  Yes.  And he needed that child pornography.  I was arrested for rape once, but I said, no, I was just acting out a fantasy.  This lady asked me to hit her with a brick.  Oh, Pete.  Oh, good old Pete. 
[00:28:00]  Good old Pete.  What else is going on, man?  I know everyone's talking about the stupid Big Bird.  What?  The Romney Big Bird fucking...  And then Obama does the commercial, which looks like an SNL skit.  It's ridiculous.  There's no...  Jimmy Fallon had a really funny bit last night on PBS.  Yeah.  He played Mr. Rogers.  You might want to search that out today.  It's a little long.  The late Mr. Rogers, yes.  But he did a very, very good parody of that whole thing.  Oh, I didn't see that one. 
[00:28:30]  Making fun of PBS.  It's right up on his front page there.  Well, yeah.  Well, let's see.  All right.  Key and Peele is all new.  Shut up.  Key and Peele.  What is that?  Commercials.  Commercials.  Oh, you're not getting anything there, Sam.  Sam, what are you doing?  Oh, boy.  Sam, why is Gamshu's trying to fucking...  On the Jimmy Fallon page, you can't fucking skip ads.  No, you can't skip it.  You can't turn it down.  Oh, not good.  Right there.  Not good.  It gives you a little time. 
[00:29:00]  It's seven, six seconds.  What's TMP?  Is that a comedy show?  I don't know.  Yeah, it's on Comedy Central.  Hilarious.  Fuck, boy.  Full screen.  What the fuck's wrong with you?  Mr. Romney's Neighborhood.  Wow.  It's supposed to be Rogers.  Sure, sure.  Look at the set, though.  They went off on the set and everything, huh?  They went all in.  It's exactly like the set.  Maybe they filmed it at PBS.  Maybe they have the set later on.  It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.  Beautiful day in the neighborhood. 
[00:29:30]  He does a good step.  Would you be mine?  Would you be mine?  Won't you be?  Won't you be?  Please, won't you be?  My neighbor.  That's pretty good.  He just took the jacket off and puts on the exact same jacket.  Another jacket.  That's pretty good.  Instead of his dumb sweater, right?  Yeah. 
[00:30:00]  He's got some guy shine in his shoes.  He's selling so many homes.  Holy shit.  Ta-da.  It is a beautiful day.  Okay.  Thank you, Manuel.  He's tipping him.  Tipped him a dollar.  Hello, neighbor.  You see this?  It's called a wallet.  Inside of a wallet, well, that's where money goes.  Now, do you know what money is? 
[00:30:30]  I'm guessing no, because you're watching public television.  That's why you don't have cable.  Therefore, you're probably poor.  Money is sort of like paper that you can use to buy things that you want.  Like toys or yachts.  Now, you may be wondering, where does money come from?  Well, it comes from a magical place called our parents.  Uh-oh, there's somebody at the door.  I wonder who it could be.  Oh, it's a good friend. 
[00:31:00]  Mr. Obama.  Hello, Mr. Romney.  Hello, Mr. Obama.  You remember Mr. Obama, right?  Last week at the debate, Mr. Obama taught us all a new word.  Choke. 
[00:31:30]  What brings you to the neighborhood today?  That's pretty good.  Well, uh, since my, uh, sleepy, uh, performance at the, uh, debate, Mr. Romney, uh, my wife, Michelle, has insisted that I, uh, pick up some new job skills.  Uh, so I'm now a mailman part-time.  Uh, and, uh, oh, look here, special delivery, uh, October, uh, jobs report.  And, uh, the unemployment numbers are down.  So, in your face.  That's just wonderful.  He ripped it up, huh? 
[00:32:00]  Did you know that Mr. Obama is the president of the United States?  It's a very important job.  You have to make big decisions.  And you're in charge of a lot of people for four years.  Uh, Mr. Romney, uh, I think you made a mistake.  I think, you mean, eight years.  You see, kids?  Mr. Obama just did something called using your imagination.  Actually, if you take a look at the post, I think you'll see that in a number of the key states...  He closed the door on him.  You want to keep going, or...?  It's fun to use your imagination. 
[00:32:30]  You know, I love to have fun and laugh.  Ha, ha, ha.  You can see the rest.  That's very funny.  Funny, though, right?  That's a really good sketch.  And I like it, because he takes shots at both sides.  Yeah.  Yep.  There's no agenda there.  He's just fucking making fun of the whole...  He's making fun of the whole fucking thing.  Yeah.  By the way, J.D. in New York City, one of our regulars, he says, read the book.  He's really pissed off.  Townsend wasn't caught with anything.  The police proved forensically from the hard drives of 11 computers, they confiscated that  he never accessed any child porn images. 
[00:33:00]  That's why all the charges were dropped.  Sorry.  But then why was he saying, I was doing research for a book?  Yeah.  What was that about?  Is this guy on the phone?  J.D., call the show.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know if he's ever called the show or so.  Is it one of those things?  Why would he say, I was doing research?  Right.  Unless they have an internet history?  I don't know.  If it was nothing.  Maybe we just don't know.  Yeah.  Maybe we just don't have enough details on this one.  Right.  We're idiots.  Because if they say, forensically, he didn't have anything, does that mean that they have 
[00:33:30]  the trail, but not the actual footage, which means that he downloaded onto an external hard  drive.  And they can't prove the footage exists because it's not on his computer.  Yeah.  Only the trail.  I don't know.  Just a question.  J.D., do you know more?  Yeah, J.D.  All of a sudden, you're fucking...  Do you know more?  J.D.  You're Steve Jobs, Matt Gaetz.  Did you see that Stacey Dash stuff?  I don't know what the Stacey Dash stuff is.  Stacey Dash.  To be honest with you.  She's that black, white chick. 
[00:34:00]  Or that white, black chick from Clueless.  You know her?  She's fine.  She's hot.  Oh, she was the...  Oh, yeah.  She's black with all white features.  It's amazing.  She's got, like, blue eyes.  It's amazing.  Her nose, her mouth...  She used to be really hot, right?  Everything.  But look at that A.  Damn, she's in King Magazine.  That booty.  King Magazine rules.  Come on, Sam.  Let me see the young lady.  Stop hogging all the hiney for yourself.  Any fans of King Magazine out there?  Now I am.  It's kind of like the black...  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Maxim.  Yeah.  King Magazine, motherfucker.  Can we get a copy of King Magazine?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  She's more white than black, right?  Well, that apparently is the consensus among black people...  Sure.  ...that are very angry with her because she tweeted that she...  Oh, how could you be angry with her?  How could you be angry with her?  Damn.  Damn.  Bent all the way over.  That's a white chick with a great tan.  Yeah.  That's what that is right there.  You'd be all right with that, right?  I'd be all up in that shit. 
[00:35:00]  You'd be all right with that, right?  Yeah.  I'd be all ups in that shit.  She's really nude and shit.  Yeah.  Look at that.  Her career went that bad, huh?  I didn't know she did nudes.  Well...  What are you doing, Sam?  She's, like, right on the edge of showing all the dirty parts.  Oh, Sam.  The dirty parts are still covered, but barely.  Yeah.  Her filth parts.  Her filthy parts.  Oh, yes.  Her dirty, dirty parts.  The parts...  Whoa.  Is that her?  Yep.  Oh, that is her.  Wow.  Damn, motherfucker.  Fuck. 
[00:35:30]  Now she's just completely naked leaning up against a wall.  That's...  Arching her back.  That's pretty good, right, man.  And all her dirty parts are exposed.  The dirty parts are the ones you've got to scrub a little more.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A lot more.  It's amazing.  They're the parts that are covered up all the time, but they're the dirtiest parts of all.  You know, when I take a shower, I kind of just wash my arm a little bit, but then  I fucking scrub my onion-y bag.  Scrub-a-dub-dub, that junk.  You scrub your dirty parts a lot more.  Oh, yeah.  Gotta wash them. 
[00:36:00]  She's got...  I think she's got bad tits.  Well, let me see.  She's trying her damnedest.  She's doing, like, her shoulders are almost pinned behind her back in every shot.  Those are weird implants.  You think?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  It's the implants that are, like, um...  Like, yeah.  Wow, she's really hot.  You see?  She has juicy thighs, man.  She has nice fucking thighs.  She's all right.  She's...  She makes her...  Is she all black?  She looks very light.  She has to have some white in her, right?  Yeah.  Is there, like, a white-black combination?  I don't know.  Sam, you're the pro at that. 
[00:36:30]  You're the expert.  I wouldn't mind giving Stacey Dash a kiss.  JD wrote back, and then we get back to Stacey Dash.  I meant that I read the book.  What book?  The book that Townsend finally released?  Is it this book that's out?  Or is this another book?  See, I don't even know that much.  He signed up for the site to prove that credit card companies were knowingly accepting charges  from sites that hosted child porn images.  Oh, he's doing his own investigating.  That's what you do.  You know, if you want to do a story about robbing a bank, what you do is you run into  a bank with a gun, and you rob it. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  And then you just say, no, I'm writing a book on bank robbery.  I'm sorry, JD.  That is really fucking suspicious.  That's taking a major chance that people are going to believe you.  Really?  Come on.  Wouldn't you write ahead of time, like, this is what I'm doing, and call the authorities  and go, look, this is why I'm doing this?  And they would say, don't do it, or we're going to charge you.  Right.  No, they'd say, you're the guitarist for the hook.  Stop it.  Exactly.  I don't try to fucking windmill with my guitar.  Don't you investigate crime.  That's a stretch.  He said he signed up for the site, I'm assuming it's a child porn site, to prove that credit 
[00:37:30]  card companies were knowingly accepting charges from sites that hosted child porn images.  He talks about how he was molested as a child and how it affected him.  Poor boy.  That's a stretch, man.  I'm sorry.  I don't buy that.  There's something really fishy about that.  Poor boy.  You're in the public eye big time.  You're a huge star, and you're going to just sign up for a child porn site like that?  Under the name Pete Townsend?  And you're just going to assume that everyone's going to believe why you did this?  Pete Townsend of the Who, he writes in there.  That was his screen name. 
[00:38:00]  P-T-O-T-W.  He was able to explain his way out of it, but that's a little strange.  Yeah.  In my humble opinion.  That is odd.  So what did Stacey Dash tweet at?  So Stacey Dash was tweeting how she's going to be voting for Romney, and that seems to  be the future, what she thinks is best for the country, regardless of her ideas.  That's what her idea is.  And, well, the black community jumps all over her and just starts with personal attacks, 
[00:38:30]  calling her, you know, race traitor, and trade her to the Caucasians for Bill Clinton.  They wanted to, like, do that.  And then just some really nasty racist tweets.  Black people feel that if you're black and you're not voting for Obama, that you're a  race traitor, a horrible person, because they feel that you should vote for a person based  solely on the color of his skin instead of the content of his character. 
[00:39:00]  Well, a lot of black people still have this mentality of, if you, it's like, don't air  our dirty laundry in public, you know, and it's this clannishness or this cliquishness.  Oh, what are you saying there?  Well, you know, CL.  Yes.  And if you go outside the mindset that you're a traitor to the whole group, and it's just,  it's very outdated thinking.  She probably makes a lot of money, and for, you know, it's probably more tax reasons than  anything else.  Actually, if you're a black person that is calling another black person a race traitor 
[00:39:30]  for voicing their own ideas and their separate ideas from the group, you're a hypocrite.  You're a fucking hypocrite.  If you don't want to, like, a lot of, I've talked to people that have said, hey, don't  look at us and put us in the same group as, you know, gangbangers that are fucking killing  each other.  Just because a black person does something horrible doesn't mean that it's a reflection 
[00:40:00]  on all black people.  If a white person does something, it doesn't reflect on the entire white community.  We just want the same thing.  Well, then you've got to fucking do it the other way around, too.  Right.  If a black person wants to vote for Romney, you can't then say you're out of the group,  you know?  There's this whole group mentality that is just a hypocrisy.  But isn't it true, though, a lot of people just vote for presidents because they're really  dumb shit?  Yes.  Like, a lot of women voted for Kennedy because he was cute.  Yeah, yeah.  Adorable.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right?  It's just so blatant in the black community. 
[00:40:30]  This is worse, though.  It's so blatant.  And it's not really talked about.  I mean, the media will mention it.  No.  Again, can you imagine, again, if a white candidate said, don't vote for this or you're a race  traitor, or not a candidate, but a white, it would be addressed harsher.  Not like, oh, look at this.  It would be addressed as, you know, look at the tone of addressing it would be different.  If somebody got up and actually started saying, look, vote for Romney, because if you're white, 
[00:41:00]  you've got to vote for Romney because I think he'd be better for white people.  I think he'd be a better president for white people.  So if you're white, you should vote for him.  Holy mother of fuck, you can't say that.  That's crazy racist stuff to say.  But black people are doing that exact thing.  Exact thing.  They're saying that it's better for black people to have a black president in office.  Well, it's better for white people to have a white president.  So I'm white, and I'm voting for Romney based solely on the color of his skin. 
[00:41:30]  There.  Fuck with me now.  Yeah, I mean, a lot of people are voting for Romney because they don't want to vote for a black guy.  Right.  It's a fact.  A lot of people in this room.  A lot of white.  Not a lot of people in this room.  All right.  One guy in this room.  But that's going on as well.  And white evangelicals do the same thing.  Oh, Denver Pest.  Do I hate that fucking commie cocksucker?  Who?  Denver Pest.  Oh.  But they really don't.  They don't say the same. 
[00:42:00]  They don't.  They don't.  No.  It's very open and blatant.  You know what the problem with a lot of conservatives are?  Is their sheer honesty.  And don't tell me, oh, no, they lie.  They do this.  I understand what you get there.  But, I mean, people just can't stand some people's ideology.  Especially if you're open and honest with it.  It's like, this is what I believe in.  Fuck you.  But liberals just seem to be a lot more sneaky with things.  Ugh. 
[00:42:30]  Dishonest with their racism.  My grandmother would always say, don't be a sneaky Pete.  Oh.  Don't be a sneaky Pete.  Let's bring back that.  Yeah.  Sneaky Pete.  We don't like sneaky Pete.  No.  Is Aunt Coulter on the subject?  So, Stacey Dash is probably not a name everybody knows, but they know that actress.  Oh, I know the actress.  I love that movie.  Right?  Okay, so this is just an example of what she got in response to her tweet saying, vote  for Romney.  You're an unemployed black woman endorsing Mitt Romney.  You're voting against yourself thrice, you poor, beautiful idiot. 
[00:43:00]  And it went on from there.  That's only, you know, what I can read.  That's what you can read out loud.  On the air.  Right.  That's how I found out about it that night.  I got in.  I started reading my Twitter feed and saw the retweets of the bile directed against her.  You know, I really admire right-wingers in Hollywood.  They're doing a very brave thing.  It can hurt their careers.  But there is no one braver in the world than a black conservative.  What they go through, as Mia Love has seen, and Alan West, and Condoleezza Rice, and Clarence  Thomas, Herman Cain, the list goes on and on. 
[00:43:30]  Just the vicious, actually racist attacks.  Not using the word Chicago or apartment, which Libels claims is racist when a Republican  says it.  No, the N-word we're talking about here.  And then, after putting black conservatives through this vicious, hazing process, liberals  turn around and taunt Republicans for not having more blacks in our party.  Well, maybe if you'd stop harassing them, black people might look and see, oh, the Republicans  have a lot of ideas I like, like being against abortion and gay marriage, unlike the Democrats. 
[00:44:00]  Amazing, yeah.  What a great point.  It's such blatant, open racism.  And the liberals try to look at Republicans or conservatives and say that they're being  racist when you mention Chicago.  And you talk about a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  They're trying to tag racism to everything.  What was the peanut butter and jelly sandwich thing?  I saw that, but...  I don't know, I guess peanut butter is brown, that's racist. 
[00:44:30]  So what's the problem?  Why is that sandwich racist?  How did that come about?  I don't know, the jelly side gets better jobs, higher pay.  I saw that article, that was one I just didn't feel like reading, because it was such nonsense.  It is nonsense.  I probably should have read it for the radio show.  It's complete and utter nonsense, yes.  So they're trying to say peanut butter and jelly is racist?  It's racist.  It's the best sandwich you could have.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich way before any other fucking type of sandwich.  Even ham is Swiss with a little mustard. 
[00:45:00]  To white privilege.  Peanut butter and jelly is white privilege.  Yeah.  It's the cheapest sandwich you can make.  What are they talking about?  Jelly sandwich.  I grew up on this shit because it was cheap.  The question is raised, what about Somali or Hispanic students who might not eat sandwiches?  I still don't know what this is about.  Americans eat peanut butter and jelly.  So even mentioning it is too...  Well, it's horrible.  Is this a dumb school thing?  Yeah, it's some principal, I believe.  A principal's trying to get what? 
[00:45:30]  I bet it's a principal.  Peanut butter and jelly banned at his school?  Yeah, that they're saying peanut butter and jelly.  I can't put my kid in school.  It's important.  How do you homeschool?  I know Brewers come in here.  I need to know.  I'm not sending my kid to a school where they're going to try to ban a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Does Brewer homeschool?  Yay, homeschools.  Yeah.  What is this guy talking about?  Now I'm pissed.  I think it might even be Veronese Gutierrez from the Harvey Scott K-8 school.  Where's this?  Used it as an example. 
[00:46:00]  Portland.  Of course.  So this idiot is trying to say peanut butter and jelly is racist?  It's an example of a subtle form of racism in language.  Oh, God.  I fucking hate schools.  Yeah, dumb principals.  Racism in language.  It's not a subtle form of racism in language.  No, it's not.  It's looking for something just so you have a point to make.  It's not an accurate point.  Do you realize I got just over two years and I got to put my kid in a school?  Wow.  And have to deal with this shit?  I'm going to lose my mind.  You got to get one of them private schools.  I want a school where they still celebrate Valentine's Day, still celebrate Mother's Day and Father's Day. 
[00:46:30]  I don't think so.  They don't call it the Winter Festival.  They don't call it the Halloween.  What?  They don't say Halloween, right?  The fall fucking.  Fall thing.  The fall thing.  They call it the fall thing, probably.  Awesome.  Where do I find a school where it's old school like we grew up with?  I don't know.  Private schools might be a little bit more.  Peanut butter and jelly is racist?  I think so.  It is.  A little bit.  On white bread.  Yes.  I think because that's the only way to eat it. 
[00:47:00]  Boo for pumpernickel.  Pumpernickel.  Well, pumpernickel stinks.  Does not belong mixed with white bread.  No.  Pumpernickel, boo!  Pepperidge Farm, yay!  Pumpernickel.  Worst bread ever, right?  I hate pumpernickel.  I like, I'll tell you what I like.  Name a bread that's worse than pumpernickel.  I don't think there is one.  Thank you.  Yellow bread.  Ew.  No, I like a good piece of pumpernickel and some borscht.  Do you like sourdough?  I love sourdough.  A good sourdough.  Pretzel bread's the best, if you want my opinion. 
[00:47:30]  Pretzel bread.  I like bread made with that potato shit.  I don't know what it is.  Potato bread?  Something like that.  What the hell is that?  Do you like challah?  No, I don't.  Oh, challah, yo.  Or is that just a Jew thing?  Challah.  Don't you like the French toast made with challah bread?  Oh, yeah.  Then I like the challah bread.  It's delicious.  What about a good marble rye?  I don't like any word where you have to clear your throat and talk at the same time.  Challah.  Challah. 
[00:48:00]  Challah.  I don't like.  I don't like in my bread drawer.  Yeah.  When I look and I see the pumpernickel.  Oh, yes.  Working its way into the Pepperidge Farm white.  Hate that.  You know what?  Pepperidge Farm, worse than pumpernickel.  Yes, terrible bread.  Why do you have to cut it so fucking thin?  Thin?  It's not soft either.  My mom would get the day-old shit, and then the jelly would seep through my stupid Pepperidge  Farm bread shit.  I want big bread.  My mom ruined the peanut butter and jelly experience.  It's so difficult to ruin that.  How do you fuck up peanut butter and jelly? 
[00:48:30]  My mom did.  Oh.  She had to get the day-old bread that was fucking sliced extra thin.  Plus, it was racist that you were even eating it.  Why do they slice Pepperidge Farm so fucking thin?  It's stupid.  Because Pepperidge Farm remembers.  Remembers what?  Shitty bread, apparently.  I like nice, fluffy, wonder bread.  Yeah.  It's great.  I don't want to do the school bit today, because it's going to drive me nuts.  Because this is the point where everyone calls up and says what's happening with their  kids.  It's un-fucking-believable.  Sorry that you don't have a mommy. 
[00:49:00]  I want my kid to fucking celebrate Mother's Day at school.  You explain that shit to the kid.  Why does everyone else have to suffer?  Because it's not inclusive, Opie.  Some people don't have a mommy.  Fuck inclusive.  Some people don't have a mommy, and they don't need to be reminded.  Yeah, but when you go out in the real world, guess what?  You're going to see things aren't inclusive.  Yeah.  So why would you teach it the opposite way?  Well, due to lawsuits and things like that, everything is becoming more inclusive.  That's the way it is. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, stupid.  You know, yeah, there's situations out there that you've got to explain to your kid.  Be a parent and explain that shit.  Do you like participation trophies?  No.  Oh, God.  Do they do a father-son?  I swear to God, my kid will never bring home a participation trophy.  Do they do father-son things?  I will tell them, oh, it's nice they're giving you a participation trophy, but we're now going  to throw that in the garbage.  Do they do that these days?  What?  Father-son things at school?  I don't know.  Or is it not inclusive to people that don't have dads?  I don't know.  And for two mom families, for the lesbians. 
[00:50:00]  Because I remember going to father-son breakfast with my dad.  Oh, really?  Oh, it was so good.  Was he hungover?  Totally.  Fucking hungover.  Was he miserable?  Off his gourd.  You could tell he was just quickly putting in his time.  And I remember, I don't know why he got pissed off at this, but we were driving to the  father-son thing and we were late and he got lost.  Yeah.  And didn't have fucking...  GPS?  GPS back then.  No.  Well, it was the 50s.  There were no satellites up yet for GPS. 
[00:50:30]  And he cut like the worst gasser, the worst hungover gasser in the car and it stunk.  And then he looked over when we parked and he goes, don't mention that fart for some  reason.  I don't know why, but the second I walked in, just all my friends that were there, I was  like, my father farted in the car and it stunk.  Jesus Christ.  So he ruined your special day.  Yeah, with his gasser.  I thought it was funny. 
[00:51:00]  But yeah, he was so fucking hungover though.  And he was just a miserable guy at the father-son breakfast as we all sat there with dads.  And then the kid that didn't have a dad, he was there too with like his fucking uncle  or something.  Wait, did the other fathers hear that he farted?  Yeah, everybody did.  I was a rat.  I ratted my dad out for a big stinky gasser in the Rambler.  That's great.  He had to open the fly window to air it out. 
[00:51:30]  Oh my God.  The fly window.  You just dated yourself.  Oh, please.  Sam, you know what a fly window is, right?  You know what a fly window is, Sam?  No, I have no idea.  You fucker.  I don't know what a fly window is.  Yeah.  No, I'm funny.  E-Rock's nodding.  Yes, he had one on his boat when he used to go to high school in Florida.  His boat, a little fly window on the fly bridge.  See, they're coming in already.  Preschool, you're not allowed to sit Indian style anymore.  It's cross-legged.  Cross applesauce?  Indian style.  What?  That's what you learned, right?  Applesauce?  It was the very end of Indian style when I was a little boy. 
[00:52:00]  It was still Indian style when I was a kid.  But why applesauce?  There are people who are allergic to it.  And there's sugar added to it.  That's unhealthy.  It's unhealthy.  Why is it bad to tell kids to sit Indian style if that's what Indians did?  Why is that bad?  Did they?  Why is it bad to point that out?  Maybe they didn't really sit like that.  In their culture.  And Indians retired or being misrepresented as having sat a certain way.  Exactly.  That's how they sat.  We never sit them like that.  Sit them. 
[00:52:30]  People are screaming at me, peanut allergies.  But this principal is not talking about peanut allergies.  No, it's racism.  He's basically saying we can't have peanut butter and jelly in our school because it's  considered racist.  That's ridiculous.  It may be a lady principal, by the way.  Veronese.  Crisscross applesauce.  You know, we have uncrustable, those peanut butter and jelly things in the vending machines  here.  Ew.  Go get me one right now.  I'm a huge fan of those fucking things.  I won't contribute to racism.  Do they have the strawberry ones?  I think it's grape.  Grapes good, too. 
[00:53:00]  The whites only vending machine?  That's what it is.  That's the next time.  Yeah.  PB&J.  Have you had the uncrustables, even though they make fake crust?  Because that's how they keep everything inside?  Really?  So even though they cut the crust, then the outer layer of the uncrustables is now the crust.  It's crust?  Well, technically, yeah.  Because there's no goodness under that.  You really can never get rid of the crust.  They've got to pinch it all the way around to keep everything in.  So technically, that becomes now the crust.  It's one of the problems I have with the uncrustables.  I've been thinking about trying one from the vending machine ever since you were talking 
[00:53:30]  about them.  Try them.  They're amazing.  I was buying them by the box for a while.  I had to give up.  I was becoming addicted to the uncrustables.  Have you had an uncrustable?  Elliot Ness and his uncrustables.  Brings you right back to being a kid, man.  I've never had that.  Anybody want to do an uncrustable party today?  Dare I say delish.  Why don't we punch you in the face, party, for mentioning that?  All right.  We'll take back my statement, then.  Megan, who sounds really hot, but I bet you she isn't, from D.C., has more in the peanut 
[00:54:00]  butter story.  She's saying we're getting it all wrong.  Megan.  All right.  You guys just look at a headline.  You start yammering about how everyone's banning peanut butter and jelly.  You don't even read anything.  Thank you for letting people know that.  I asked Sam a few times, and that's basically the gist he gave me.  Well, you're trusting Sam?  Hey, Miss Know-It-All, what is the story, then?  Exactly.  Nobody said they were banning anything.  Enlighten us.  This principle.  Actually, no.  You did say that.  Opie said they're banning peanut butter and jelly. 
[00:54:30]  He didn't say it like that, though.  And then everyone was going off to their workplace and saying, oh, I hired Opie and Anthony that  they're banning peanut butter and jelly.  I sure love spreading lies.  Yeah, it is.  It's one of the joys of this job.  It really is.  It's a treat that we get to really corrupt people's ideas.  And then you awkwardly repeat what you heard on the show to your co-workers, and they look  at you like, you're an idiot.  Yeah, exactly.  I love that we get to do that.  Go ahead, Megan.  What's the story about?  The story was, I mean, you guys are not going to like this either, but the story is just 
[00:55:00]  that they have a program where the kids are supposed to learn about different cultures.  And so one of the examples was that the kids could say to each other, hey, you know, in  America, we eat peanut butter and jelly.  What do you eat in your country?  Yeah.  That's what we said.  That's literally all it was.  So what's the problem with that?  If some kids eat...  It sounds like they're saying that peanut butter and jelly is bad, and that's not what  they're saying at all.  They were just using it as an example.  Well, how is it racist, then?  That's my point.  It's not. 
[00:55:30]  But they're saying in the story that peanut butter and jelly is racist.  That's what I just said.  So what are you talking about?  Yeah.  Because everyone started tweeting and saying that peanut butter and jelly is being used  as an example of white privilege.  That's literally what it is.  If you read...  Yeah, yeah.  But that's what we're saying.  So it's being...  How is it a white privilege to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?  That's a cheap sandwich.  That's why we ate it growing up.  I'll say that again, yes.  I know, but that's not the school's fault that people twisted it into saying that.  That's not what it was supposed to be. 
[00:56:00]  Are you a teacher?  Yes.  Ah, yeah, you are.  You teach in D.C., huh?  Outside D.C., yeah.  Good outside or bad outside?  Good outside.  Are you still allowed to hug a kid that's kind of having a breakdown?  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Sure.  Oh.  Because now they're telling teachers they're not even allowed to touch kids.  You got to hug him.  Wait, wait, wait.  He's crying.  Uncle Paul has said a different...  Uncle Paul's touching his penis while he's talking. 
[00:56:30]  Holy shit.  I got an itch.  You goddamn Tattletail.  Uncle Jim is what it is.  Well, people know that Jimmy doesn't just do voices.  He becomes the characters.  I think we've explained that over the years, right?  It doesn't mean he has to rub his shaft.  He's the character now.  He's not Jim Norton anymore.  He might have multiple personalities.  Might?  Jesus Christ.  Hey, are you allowed to hug your kids still there, Megan?  Well, I teach high schoolers, so...  Ooh.  Let them press their hard-ons against you. 
[00:57:00]  Those boners that's your bottom pop up for any fucking reason.  Back of your knuckles.  Oh, look.  I'm smelling a fucking new loose-leaf paper.  Boing.  Megan.  Oh, look at that.  Do you see boners while you're teaching?  No, I don't think they'd ever...  I've never been looking for them.  Well, guys know how to fucking strap down their boners when they have to, so...  Are you one of the cool, attractive teachers?  I think so, yeah.  Are you one of the young, cool, attractive teachers?  What goes on in that teacher lounge?  You suck some cock? 
[00:57:30]  Do you allow...  You beat me to a fuck.  I was going to say, do you allow your bosoms to be on display?  You show a little cleavage to you?  Well, as I told you last time, it helps me listen better.  Oh, I told you last time.  I'm a multiple caller.  So that means you, like, unbutton one extra button for the kids.  Yeah.  Nice.  No, I wear tight V-neck sweaters.  Oh.  Wow.  Are you ample?  Yes, I told you this.  We don't remember. 
[00:58:00]  See, we just asked the same question.  I remember you, but I don't remember what we talked about last time.  I don't remember you.  How big are your titties, madam?  Jimmy, I send you pictures of them all the time.  Oh, shit.  You do?  Could you send me another one?  This way I'll know which email do you use.  Look how Jimmy got real serious on this.  I want to see your breasts.  I'm just going to say my email all of a sudden.  No, no, no.  To my email.  To my email.  Don't say yours.  Say mine.  And why hasn't Jimmy showed us?  Jimmy doesn't share.  He's selfish.  I don't remember him.  Jimmy's selfish with your tits. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, man.  Wait.  Miss, what is my email address?  What's yours?  You could say it, yeah.  The real Jim Norton?  At Gmail.  Yeah, but I text you also.  I have your phone number.  Oh, shit.  I know who she is.  Okay, yeah.  Hum-na-hum-na-hum-na Ed Norton?  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not going to say your last name.  It begins with a...  I know exactly who you are.  Okay, I didn't recognize...  I didn't know this was the same person.  Yes, I do.  You got any pictures, Jimmy?  I'll tell you.  Maybe she emailed me.  Let's pop a picture up there. 
[00:59:00]  The last picture I have is the one that I emailed you a long time ago.  Megan, please tell me you don't use your real name on our show.  Oh, boy.  Wow, you're not a good liar.  Is it Megan?  Well, there's a lot of Megans in the world.  Yeah, huh?  But none as filthy as you.  Well, you're a dirty, dirty girl, aren't you?  Okay, hold on.  Oh, yeah, I know.  I just didn't recognize the name.  Let me see them beefy tits. 
[00:59:30]  Jesus.  Wow, Megan.  What the fuck?  Show up.  Don't show her last name.  Don't show her last name.  I'm not.  No, there's no words on that.  Oh, okay, okay.  Let's just...  You want to tutor my young son?  Yeah.  On the ways of the world?  This picture is...  Damn, Megan.  You have a top on.  It's a white shirt.  Not bad.  Damn, Megan.  That's not too shabby.  Not bad.  Those are only for Jimmy.  No, but you're wearing a shirt on.  It's all right.  We're just...  You got one of those white tank tops on. 
[01:00:00]  Passing it around the studio.  And the nipples are going, oh, I don't know.  The nipples are...  I need to poke out.  I can't be held back like this.  I need a little more fabric.  I'm a nipple, and I refuse to be held back.  Damn, Megan.  Yeah, well, I'm at school, and I should go teach now.  All right.  Have fun.  I'm futzing around with my boner over here.  Are you futzing?  All right, man.  Have a good day teaching whatever you teach.  Bye, Megan.  Goodbye, teach.  I just texted you.  Let's say hi to Bill in Philly real fast before we take a break. 
[01:00:30]  Bill.  Hey, boys.  First time, long time.  Who gives a shit?  Who gives a turkey?  Whack, whack.  All right, so I teach at a K-4 school.  We were trying to have a free father-daughter dance and mother-son dance.  That sounds sick.  While we were in the beginning of the planning phase, we heard from another state that they  did the same thing, and they were in the process of getting sued, so we had to cancel  the free event that we were going to have for the kids.  Who was suing them?  Well, what's the reason to sue? 
[01:01:00]  Look.  Sue everyone.  Some kids just don't have mothers, and some don't have fathers.  Yeah, and you know what?  That does suck.  Yeah, but that's life, too.  But that is life.  You're going to have some tough shit happen to you after school.  You're going to have things that other people don't have, and other people are going  to have things that you don't have, and that's life.  And then someone's going to smack you in the head when you go, well, I think I should  have what you have.  Right.  Because that's what they taught me in school.  It's stupid.  It is stupid.  The majority has to fight back, because I know, I've talked to enough parents now and  shit, and they're all sick of it. 
[01:01:30]  But one or two of these people get into everyone's fucking heads, and they change all this stuff.  Exactly.  There's got to be a better way to do it.  Please.  Majority fights back, and then you figure out how to properly handle maybe the kid that  doesn't have a father or a mother, or has a different religion, or doesn't celebrate  fucking Christmas.  Exactly ticker tackling.  All right.  Thanks, boys.  I want to go old school, where, you know, when we did the Pledge of Allegiance, and that 
[01:02:00]  one kid had to stand up because his parents told him to.  Yeah.  And he had to raise his hand and go, oh, I got to leave the room because mommy and daddy  told me I can't be part of this.  No one, when I was growing up, even did that, because it would have been looked at like you're  a fucking commie.  Oh, no.  I don't remember his name, but they marched a kid out.  Really?  Oh, in grammar school every fucking day.  What was he?  Jehovah's Witness or something?  You know, back then, I don't know.  I mean, I don't know.  You had to.  I would assume he was sort of like Middle Eastern.  No one would have dreamt of that when I was growing up. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, no.  We had one.  Wow.  We absolutely had one.  Well, you just sit there and go, whatever.  This isn't for me, but I don't give a fuck enough time.  I'm not going to be an outcast.  Right.  To stand up and, like, make a scene?  Yeah.  I don't know.  We all had to fucking stand.  If you didn't stand, you fucking would.  Parents would hit you.  My dad would hit me.  What the fuck are you talking about?  You stand up for your fucking country, you fucking asshole.  But I just wanted to be different. 
[01:03:00]  I never wanted to be different.  God, did I just want to fit in.  You just want to fit in?  Oh, was I a fitting in fucking guy.  I just wanted to be just like everyone else.  Oh, boy.  Well, I don't know what we accomplished with this first hour.  I liked it.  A lot.  We accomplished a fuckload.  Same thing we accomplish every day.  Absolutely zero.  Just making the people's commute a little easier, I think.  Yeah, we just want to get you to work.  Right.  And home from work, safe and sound with a few chuckles. 
[01:03:30]  A few chuckles.  And it is hump day.  Ah, hump day.  We're getting you over the hump.  Over the hump.  Slide down the backside door of the week.  That's right.  Yeah.  Where's Loverboy?  We're going to do Jacktober next.  All right.  I'm feeling Jacktober where we might be, you know.  It's hinging on today, I think.  It is, right?  Yeah.  Today is very, very critical.  Because Scott and Todd really just pissed everyone off.  And then yesterday was lackluster.  Yesterday.  Maybe our performance in Jacktober was lackluster. 
[01:04:00]  It didn't fit the format yesterday, really, with the two girls and the guy.  And I don't know.  It's weird.  It's all.  I hate Jacktober.  It's all the same show.  Every year.  This is our benchmark bit.  It's all.  You want someone else to take over Jacktober?  It's the same show.  Yes.  Every show is the same show.  People look forward to this every year.  I know.  We all look forward to it.  But then within a week, we're like, oh, they're all the same.  Yeah.  Well, maybe we got to pump some new energy into the bit.  Maybe.  Maybe we have to find new angles in the bit.  Yeah.  Maybe you got to look a little deeper into these shows. 
[01:04:30]  Mm-hmm.  Like, for what?  Like, maybe.  I don't know.  Maybe you tape them more than one hour.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Maybe you don't just throw the thing on and play and record and go out and play with your  friends.  Yeah.  I tape full shows every day.  How much time do you think I have to listen to terrible radio shows?  Apparently not much.  What, five minutes?  Ha, ha.  Well, we're going to try Jacktober next.  Try it.  We also have guests today.  Fuck, we got Brewer coming in today.  I'm very excited.  Jim Brewer.  Love Jim Brewer. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  One of my favorites, man.  Yes.  Fucking him and his stories.  Just amazing.  And then Johnny Rotten.  Yes.  John Lydon, a.k.a.  Johnny Rotten.  Johnny Rotten.  How old a gentleman is he these days?  I don't know.  He's no punk kid no more.  No, but he wasn't that old in the Sex Pistols, so I'm going to guess he was...  He's got to be 60.  20 in the Sex Pistols, so born in maybe...  He's got to be at least 60.  59.  Oh, he's born in 56, I think, so...  That's...  06 is 50.  So he's pushing 60.  Wow.  What'd you think of Neil Young putting your name in his song? 
[01:05:30]  All right.  What'd you think about that?  Oh, right on.  Yeah.  We better be on our best behavior, because someone could lose some teeth today.  Yeah, he doesn't fucking play games.  No, he's not.  He's not a nice guy.  Is he really a rotten?  This could be a problem.  Johnny Rotten.  Yeah, he's fun, though.  I watched some footage of him yesterday.  He's reasonable, but he's just very entertaining.  What is he promoting?  I don't know.  I know his band, Public Limited, I think they're called.  Yeah.  Public Image?  No, Public Lim...  Is it...  Public Image LTD?  Yes.  Public Image LTD? 
[01:06:00]  Yes.  They're playing in...  Oh, give me some Public Image.  They're on tour now.  They're playing...  They played in Brooklyn last night, and they're playing this Saturday in the city.  Let me...  Yeah, and in Philly tomorrow, I think.  Is this the one?  Yeah.  Play a little of this going into break.  We'll be back.  I could be wrong.  I could be right.  I could be wrong.

[01:11:00]  But he can blow that French horn  I'm being  I know  Because what I did was  I grabbed him by the shirt collar  And I threw him against the wall  And I started yelling  Dino  Dino  Dino  Dino  Dino  Dynamo  To blow your horn  Horn  Horn  I roughed him up  I'm being yelled at  That my alarm doesn't go off for 20 minutes  Stop  Sorry  Brian Wilson's no longer in the band  Oh no  And they're saying there's a riff with the guys  But there's no riff with the guys 
[01:11:30]  What that's about is  He can't perform anymore  We all noticed that  He's some kind of a crazy person  Yeah, but just put him on stage  That's what they did  With a fake keyboard  That's what they should keep doing  His hands are taped to it  The only reason to see him live  Is so you could at least see Brian Wilson  If there's not even the illusion there  But even that was awkward  Because that's what they were doing for a while  Yeah, but I mean Al Jardine  Brian Wilson is fried  Al Jardine's not going to be there either  It's Mike Love and his friends  Pretending to be the Beach Boys  Well, it's good enough though  Mike Love and friends  It's not good enough 
[01:12:00]  Is that what it is?  Yeah  Sing Kokomo 95 times  But see, that's what's going on with bands  They become franchises  And it doesn't matter  If there's any original members  Leonard Skinner's down to one guy  Brian Wilson's not happy  They're still Leonard Skinner  Huh?  Brian Wilson's not happy about it  He's fried  He doesn't even know what the fuck  I heard from somebody  That went to one of the concerts  That people were slapping around  A big beach ball  Like beach balls in the audience  And Brian Wilson stopped the show 
[01:12:30]  And made them stop fucking  Knocking around beach balls  Freaking him out  No  He'd swear  Swear  And everyone just started booing him  And that's why Brian Wilson's no longer with the band  They can't handle this anymore  It's a guy to break  It was freaking him out  It was freaking him out  It's a lot of drugs  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Oh, it's great  And it's like a beach boy show  You think beach balls  Fucking, it's like a beach party  And beach balls being knocked around  And he was like  Knock it off with those  What did he think it was?  I don't know  UFOs  Fucking  He doesn't need the distractions 
[01:13:00]  Crazy people  Bigfoot  Can we play another clip  From the great interview  That Ron Bennington did  With Brian Wilson?  Brian Wilson  It's one of my favorite things  Listen  Crazy Brian Wilson  Ronnie had to work really hard that day  Just sit him on stage  You don't even  They didn't even  That's what they should be doing  It was making everyone sad  You don't want to be sad  At a beach boys show  No, you're supposed to be sad  I don't want to go to a beach boys show  That the beach boys aren't that  You go to a buffet show  Or a beach boys show  To just kind of be festive  And happy  Yeah, but you want to see the people  And then you see this fucking zombie  Yeah  I want to see Brian Wilson 
[01:13:30]  And Al Jardine  He doesn't even know he's on stage  Not stupid Mike Love  Wearing his own beach boys hat  Like it's a new band  Trying to spread the word  You, uh, you know  Having your lovely bride come out  To a beach boys song  You have a vested interest  In the beach boys  Vested?  Yes  So you don't like seeing them  Being, uh, perverted like this  They're bullshitting around  Is what Mike Love is doing  Bullshitting around  You don't think Mike Love, though  Is the, the real  No  Like, guy behind the beach boys  Get the fuck out of here 
[01:14:00]  Mike Love  No  He's keeping it alive, though  He's the lead guy  Brian Wilson is the beach boys  Wow  But I wish they would  Make Brian Wilson the leader  You would see some weird shit  That's what I'm talking about  He is a fucked up  He's fried, man  He is fucked up  Yeah, but look at what he did  Well, and I appreciate that  He made some ridiculous music  Mike Love didn't write  Some of the great songs  He wrote Kokomo  Oh, see?  That's a good song  Get the fuck out of here  That was a good song  If Jess had walked down the aisle  The Kokomo  Oh, no  No, like, what the fuck? 
[01:14:30]  Oh, God  This marriage is doomed  You like this?  Ooh, yeah  Bermuda  Look, she looks so pretty  In that dress  Oh, look at her  Walking down the aisle  Look, Sam looks so happy  Why are they playing  This fucking song?  Yeah  Jesus  She's doing a really awkward  Awful dance  On the way down  Oh, yeah  Didn't the Muppets  Do this song or something?  Didn't John Stamos  Play drums on this?  Why are they using this?  What song did you come out to? 
[01:15:00]  Don't make him cry  Don't make him cry  I'm not gonna cry  You might cry  You might get a little pissy-eyed  Come on, you're gonna squirt?  You're gonna squirt?  Yeah  Come on, sports fans  Sports fans  Sports fans  Like, listen to this song  Compared to Kokomo  Like the horns  Get out of here  Very Beatles-esque  Yeah  The horns  Thieves  Fucking thieves, man  The Beatles were heavily influenced  By what?  By bed sounds  Oh, what?  Yeah  Oh, please  Ask McCartney  I've talked to him 
[01:15:30]  He said no  What?  This is a song  It is a good song  I like this song  I like the Beach Boys  It's incredible  I didn't see you  In your Boy Scout uniform  When you were seven  Being molested to this  Why?  They got a girl  On the Harlem Globetrotters now  Oh, you didn't have one  Oh, no  Yeah, yeah  Oh, boy  They do?  Oh, boy  Is it a sister?  Yeah, it's a sister  All right  Yeah, motherfucker  Who's this broad?  Huh?  Oh, my God  Why are they in pink? 
[01:16:00]  Oh, it's the pink thing  It's the pink cancer problem  It's the pink month  Cancer awareness  October's pink month  That's cool  Do they put one basketball  On the shirt  And run around the court?  Holy shit  Holy shit  All right, look  I may have let that one  Fly out of my mouth  Before it ran through  The check valve  Holy shit  Funny is funny  Funny is funny

I don't think so  Roland's already telling us  Are you over there?  I think he's already  You don't want to talk about it?  He doesn't like  The worst thing about Roland  Is like  Make sure  Because he doesn't like  Zemeckin  And it's like  What is Zemeckin?  Zemeckin  What isn't he like?  I just told you  Make sure you don't  Get into me  All we're saying 
[01:17:30]  Is that  Everything has to be  Pretty much perfect  For the Johnny Rotten interview  Yeah  This is going to be  An eggshell interview  Right here  Yes  We're on high alert  Tread lightly  Motherfuckers  I'm not  I feel like  How do I say this?  There's going to be an issue  Not from us  Not from us  Not from me  We're not going to push an issue  But I'm telling you right now  I think there's going to be a problem  Oh boy  Not from me  Not from me  The old dirt road 
[01:18:00]  Uh huh  Uh huh  Uh huh  By the way  We smell these things  Yes  And  I mean  He has to get in the building perfectly  Everything downstairs  Has to be perfect  Or he said he would leave  This is  And then he's going to come up here  And come on our show  And he has walked off shows  In the past  For them not being prepared  Yes  Or uh  Because they ask dumb questions  You did not prepare  Good enough  To interview me  What?

Yeah  What does he play?  Fonzie? 
[01:19:30]  Arthur Fonzarelli?  I don't know  It really is sad  When you remember  Vividly remember  Watching Happy Days  When it was first run  And then you're watching  Him do those  Reverse mortgage commercials  Well  Hey  You want a reverse mortgage  Cunningham?  Ah  Hey  Get your reverse mortgage  Even worse  Is the Joni situation  Oh my god  Joni got kicked out  Of her trailer  Now why isn't  Henry Winkler  Coming to Joni's rescue?  Because she's  Maybe he is  Fucking drunk  She's a fucking drunk  And they've had it  Is she?  There have been 
[01:20:00]  Allegations of drug use  By the way  Allegations  Well supposedly  She's very loud  With her drunk friends  And she would bring them  Back to the trailer  Of her  Trailer  Husband's mother  She's living with her  Husband's mother  In a trailer  And the mom finally said  Jesus I can't take this anymore  Because she would drink all day  Then come back at night  With all her drunk friends  So then she doesn't live  In the attic anymore  Why didn't she take that apartment?  Good point  Stupid  Good point  Oh it's not real?  She's gonna use her head  The guys that were in Happy Days  They seem like really nice people  And I bet you over the years  They've tried to help Joni 
[01:20:30]  Yeah  And I bet  Joni  They finally said  You know what  Enough of this shit  Erin Moron  I met her once  She was very nice  Yeah  She's fucking nuts  They say  Of course she was nice  She was probably hammered  Yeah  We took a picture together  She's been living in the cheap motels  But then she's been getting kicked out of the cheap motels  She's a mess  What's wrong with her?  Let's do some Jocktober before Brewer gets here  Please  She always had a problem  It's Jocktober  Jocktober  A celebration of all things shitty in radio 
[01:21:00]  That's not very nice  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions  That's so bad  Wow  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid  Jocktober  O-M-G  Hosts  Holes  Bits  And Stunt Boys  This isn't funny  It's time for  Jocktober  We're going to Rhode Island today  Oh yeah 
[01:21:30]  Giovanni and Kim in the morning  On 92 Pro FM in Rhode Island  That's right  Who's the guy that looks like E-Rock  Giovanni  Alright so we got  Giovanni is the radio veteran  Then you got the young kid  And then you got the fucking hole  Boy we haven't seen this lineup before  That's what I'm saying  Holy shit  Does she play the hole  Or is she doing something a little different  I don't want to spoil anything  Alright let's go to the first clip  Giovanni brings up a new Facebook vest  Vest? 
[01:22:00]  Vest  It's a vest  You wear it  And it connects to your Facebook  What?  It's a vest  And you wear it  And it connects to your Facebook  All the details will be exposed  As Giovanni gets in  And they really are able to mine this through  For some comedy gold  Is it a real thing?  They said somebody had designed it  It wasn't for sale yet  Oh gosh  It's a wacky story  An artist and engineer at the MIT Media Lab  Her name is Melissa Kit Chow  Has invented a new vest 
[01:22:30]  That is wirelessly connected to your Facebook account  Kim  Uh oh  And will give you a hug  Every time you get a like on Facebook  Ew  This is right up your alley  Yes  Because all you do is sit there and go  Look how many likes I got on that  Look how many  You should get this  You don't want  I don't want a hug  You need to get this  Look doesn't she sit here all morning  Is there how many likes I got on that thing yesterday?  She does it all the time  Well it's enjoyable when you get one  That's like a weird crazy number  Like whoa there were 300 likes on that  So here's the thing though  You couldn't put that vest on  You couldn't  You could have the vest on  But you couldn't post something 
[01:23:00]  That everybody will like on Facebook  If you really have to go to the bathroom  Yeah that would be bad  Because then you're going to start getting lots of hugs  Why it's a bladder vest?  No  I don't usually hug people  I don't usually hug people around their bladder  Come here Jay  Let me hug you way down at your  You just don't want to be squeezed  When you're in that kind of situation  Alright it's another one of these things  Where the seasoned veteran  Reads the story  And then there's some riffing going on  Did you hear the word that Kim used for penis? 
[01:23:30]  No I didn't catch it  Giant cock  Can we listen to like the last six seconds or so?  Black gift  Unclipped lunch  We're going to have problems  Why?  Why do you say that?  I just know it  What brings you to say that?  I can't say right now 
[01:24:00]  I live for days like today  What can you say?  I live for days like today  I want to know  I don't know  I can't say  Please do  Huh?  Can you put on the music and say?  Yeah  You got the music?  Ah  Oh man 
[01:24:30]  So then he came where?  You can't say  In Sam's mouth and hair?  Jesus  I thought the music was done  Sam  I didn't want to bring up  Oh no  Hey  Oh no  Hey  Oh guys  Oh now  Didn't you used to work for the Opie and Anthony show?  It's gone  Fucking weirdo  Inside shit 
[01:25:00]  Here's what?  That dick joke?  Or the dick thing?  Yeah I want  Especially Jim  Because Jim likes the double entendre  I don't though  I don't hug people  I don't hug people around their bladder  Come here Jay  Let me hug you way down at your  You just don't want to be squeezed  When you're in that kind of situation  Oh wait I didn't hear that  I thought she dropped out  Can I hear that?  I literally thought I'm sure  She's an adult woman  Yeah  Who used the term pee-pee  To describe teenage  She stopped talking  Because she didn't know what to say  And then she said pee-pee  Can I hear 
[01:25:30]  I did not catch that  I thought she just stopped talking  Adults talking to adults  Yeah  And then she made some duties  Caca  Caca  I want to hear pee-pee  You really do?  Yeah yeah  I didn't catch it  She made a mess  Oh god  An artist and engineer  Oh shut up  Say pekka  Good one Jim  Say pekka  I don't hug people  I don't hug people around their bladder  Come here Jay  Let me hug you way down at your  You just don't want to be squeezed  When you're in that kind of situation  Pee-pee  Ew 
[01:26:00]  That's bad  Pee-pee  That's bad  Pee-pee  Pee-pee  You're just cracking up  Because I guess you gotta  Pee-pee  That was good  Pee when you get a hug  You like that  Yeah that was a good bit  Just that  Because they twist it  Originally it's about Facebook  But then what if the vest  Makes you have to go to the bathroom  I like the concept of that though  If you get a bunch of likes  You're gonna fucking  Shit's gonna be squeezed out of you  Like you're the end of a crest tube  I love that  You mean doody  Yeah  Caca-doodoo  Caca-doodoo  Out of the Cooley Hole  Cooley Hole 
[01:26:30]  Stop  That was great  Maybe  Hey  It's a great song  It's a great song  Alright  Giovanni and Kim finally settled  The Titanic debate  What?  We're all still thinking about  Yeah you know  What?  You know that movie Titanic  That everybody still talks about  Oh I thought it was figurative  I thought it was figurative  Like there's a giant debate  Going on  So it's a Titanic debate  No it's about the  Fifteen year old movie  Twenty year old movie  Oh 
[01:27:00]  Well it's just been re-released  And um  What?  I guess Blu-ray  Blu-ray  Oh they did the 3D thing  It needed your money  They did the 3D thing  They did 3D with that?  I believe so  Yeah a couple months ago  No one really went  Okay  No one really went  No one really cared  Well it's over  Nobody's interested in it anymore  Well they're talking about it  Up there in Rhode Island  92 Pro FM  Giovanni and Kim in the morning  We could have had a happy ending  Did you see the myth?  By the way  I'm having a tough time  Listening to this  Because she sounds like  Mash up Nicole  She does a little bit  But better  Oh 
[01:27:30]  She's way better  She's better  Oh man  She's a little more focused  A little more sober  She's not hungover  And her content is better too  Yeah she's not  Busy petting her stupid dog  That she brings into work  Talking about fucking threesomes  With her husband  Nicole  With girls or guys?  With girls  But she said  That the husband  Has one rule  Not allowed to fuck  The other chick  But I stated  That you know  I'm sure they're partying  When this happens  And the second  The second she passes out 
[01:28:00]  He's fucking that other girl  With her just fucking  On the bed  Bouncing lifelessly  Up and down  To the rhythms  Of her husband  Fucking the other girl  Absolutely  You think the husband's  Feeding her a couple extra shots  Oh yeah  Hey drink up  Come on  They're dumping the shots  Out next to the bed  She's all hammered  This is fucking great  This is  Are you talking from experience sir?  Yes I am  Fucking  Get the wife  Out of the picture  How long were you married though  Before you started  Doing threesomes? 
[01:28:30]  Years right?  No  It was very early on  Oh okay  Oh  Maybe two years?  Well I mean they're like  They're months  Three months  Oh right  Okay  They're months  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  The only  The last thing I wanted to do  Was fuck the wife  At that point  You were done?  I wasn't even into the threesome  I was into having sex  With a different girl  Yeah  Just get the wife out of there  But that's hard  That's bad for the marriage  Yeah  Yeah 
[01:29:00]  Tell me about it  My fucking  My wife was having sex  With the tip of one of my fingers  The rest of my body is writhing  On top of a new girl  And my fingers going  Did you want to play with her pussy?  No  I didn't even want to do that  That fucking thing  What did you get?  One knuckle in?  I couldn't even tell you where it was  I had  There was such non-interest  In the wife's vag  I wanted all over that new chick 
[01:29:30]  Would you kiss her?  The wife while you were doing this?  Yeah  Yuck  Why would I want to do that?  Fucking mess  Well can we learn about the Titanic place?  Oh right  I always bring it back to me  Don't I?  We could have had a happy ending  Did you see the Mythbusters Titanic episode?  No  They proved that Jack and Rose  Could have both floated on that stupid door  If she would have taken her life jacket off  And strapped it underneath  It would have provided extra buoyancy  And they both could have fit 
[01:30:00]  So Rose was selfish  She was  She was a selfish woman  Rose  How dare she  You selfish  Jack  Rose  Rose  Jack  Jack  Jack  Rose  Rose  Jack  Where are you Jack?  What happened?

I posed that question  Fuck you wank I'm leaving  No don't go  Fuck  That question's bollocks  I wonder if it'll be bollocks  Are you going to get your picture before the interview?

[01:45:00]  Like you for randomly go  We knew a homeless guy  They said he blew Barry Manilow  And Brewer goes  I believe it  I believe it  I believe it  See what I was basically saying  Because it's coming from a homeless guy  It's tough to believe  But in this case  We sort of believe the guy  Barry Manilow  Getting blown  I'm in  Yeah  I believe it  I'm 100% in  So what  No go  What year were they  Who  I thought he was dead  No Sid Vicious  You were either  Sid Vicious was the dead  I know me  Long Island  I was pretty much

[02:14:30]  O.B. Anthony  Busy day  We got Jim Brewer in studio  Yeah  And Johnny Rotten's  Outside the studio  Yes  Let's bring him in  John Lydon  I wouldn't say Lydon  Why not?  I have no idea  Come on in  Hello  Mr. Lydon  Where'd you expect us to be?  How you doing sir?  Right there  Your seat awaits  How you doing?  Wow 
[02:15:00]  Take a seat  How are you?  How are you sir?  What's going on?  Nice  So how are you doing today?  Good?  It lives  It shouldn't do it  This time of the morning  No you're right  Want to hang here?  Come here  You're not a morning guy are you?  I wouldn't be  I am  Yeah?  Rock and roller?  No I like to be up early  Not many rock and rollers are up early  I've got to be honest  Oh fuck that lousy lot  Well you've been getting up doing more on the radio for years right? 
[02:15:30]  You get used to it?  Yeah I get up early anyway  I don't like too much the late nights  I work too hard for that  You're still working though hard right?  You're still out there  The kind of people you meet late at night  You really wish you hadn't  Yeah  It's a lesson learned  Learned very young  Yeah  Yeah but I mean  You're still fucking rocking  You're not  You haven't slowed down  No I view myself as 56 years young  Yeah?  Yeah I've got another 50 plus 
[02:16:00]  50 plus?  Yeah no when I hit 100  100?  But you've been in it for a long time too  That's when I expect the rheumatism  But until then  You've been in it for a while  So you started really young obviously  Well you're as young as you feel in life  Yeah  You mustn't allow yourself to fall into that easy gap  And adults tend to talk to you badly when you're a child  And tell you to act your age  You never ever ever listen to that  Of course not  That's why we do this  It is true  There are certain lifestyles that afford you the ability to stay in a state of arrested development 
[02:16:30]  I kind of like that  No that's not quite what I meant at all  No?  What if is it?  Really?  The child is always curious and always wants to learn  And that's the condition you keep yourself in  But I like not having much responsibility  Not giving up  No no no  I love responsibility  Really?  Yes  How?  Why?  As a kid I love my toys and I wouldn't let anyone break them  Alright well responsible like that  It is in adulthood  But do you like like doing the drudgery of paying bills and things like that? 
[02:17:00]  Or are you always late noticing this is coming in?  Yeah well the drudgery for me extends to an accountant who pays them for me  Okay alright  See that's what I mean  Being able to afford the lifestyle  No no no  You have to do it that way  Because if you don't the tax will fleece you something wicked  You know the whole system is corrupted  Yes  You know the more you earn the less you get  But now are you taxed in the UK or are you taxed here?  Both  Holy fuck  That's too much  Yes it is  God damn it  Yeah 
[02:17:30]  Yes it is  I'm feeling that  Holy shit  That can't be good  Double dipping  I'm mostly American now because I mean it got so bad in England  78% means you can't function  That's insanity  78% of your fucking money  Holy shit  Yeah to pay for that pile  That's what we're fighting  We're fighting to make sure we don't get to 78% in this country  Yeah we're trying  We're fighting  What did they go to England at one point like the Stones wanted to leave  What did they get to like 85 or 90%?  No everybody wanted them to leave  That was ridiculous  How is that it? 
[02:18:00]  Jesus that's crazy man  How do you function if they take 78%?  No I mean the Stones they lead that Mick Jagger  And that's that Montserrat kind of lifestyle  It's you know  Montserrat  How do you function if they take 78%?  I can't wrap my head around that  That's crazy  Oh it can get higher  Man  There was years ago a famous story  It was Benny Hill  A comedian  His tax thing went up into 120%  That's impossible  Yeah 
[02:18:30]  Which means he owed more than he owed  He's paid  Jeez  Well it's famous  When he died  He died on a mattress  Stuffed with cash  Yeah  The only two  Three things he had  A mattress full of cash  A couch  And a TV full of porno  Oh really?  Yeah  That's a good line  Yeah yeah yeah  He loved big tits  Yeah big titted girl  Chasing him around  Loved it  Fantastic  So now what are you doing these days?  Obviously you got the band  Still playing 
[02:19:00]  Yeah  What about an album?  Yep  Called This Is Pill  It's on our own label  It took me two decades  To fight the record companies  And finally be able to break free from them  Wow  They have you tied up  They have you tied up  In every single which way  And you have to learn  The patience of a saint  To get out of that  Right  Well you know  Hello  Yeah  Well you know what's good though  What do you think about the atmosphere today  With being able to put out your own  It's funny you've got Kramer on  While we're talking 
[02:19:30]  Oh yeah  Just leave a fucking TV blaring away  I can see how much money I'm losing  He's a bit nutty that way  Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah  Would you really follow his investments?  No  No  He's got wacky sound effects  What are you going to  He's like a morning shock jock radio show  Trying to tell you what stocks to buy  I'm not on to it  Anyway  We're somewhere important  Oh yeah yeah yeah  You kind of  You know what though  It's kind of a good time  To get  To get out of that  Record company  Thing  Now 
[02:20:00]  I think so too  Yeah  You're in that  In many ways  I'm really happy to watch  The corporate record business collapse  But there were some good things there  Yeah  You know  When you really needed the backing  It was there  And it took away a lot of the daily  The rigors  You couldn't do it yourself years ago  The office pressure  I mean  The pressure we're under  This is John  Who's my manager  How you doing ma'am  It's unbelievable  Yeah  It's a  We're up at the crack of dawn  Working all day long  And then I have to go  And trot the boards in the evening  But it's alright 
[02:20:30]  You know  Yeah yeah yeah  It's a fiddle  I'm up for it  And it's what you  It's the lifestyle I've asked for  And you still enjoy doing it  Very much so  Yeah  Very much  That's a  You know  The chance to insult the entire world  Do you ever find it like  Like you're trying to top yourself  No  In doing things like that  No no no no  That's why I quit the Pistols  Yeah  Because that would have been  Yeah  That would have been the case  Yeah  You know  There was every member of the band  I wanted to top at one point  Yeah  What's the difference between 
[02:21:00]  When you were in the Pistols  And then in this band  With the creative  What was the difference  Like do you find it better now  Sex Pistols was great  Because that's where I learned  To write songs  Up until joining that band  I'd never considered singing  And there were many reasons  Because I went to Catholic school  And if you co-opted into the choir  It meant the priest said  Direct access to you  And we know about the priest  That's never good  Yeah  Oh boy  So let's say my singing style 
[02:21:30]  Is you know  A little different  Pretty improvisational  But I learned quick  And I loved it  And I got into like  More serious topics  And in a personal politics  Kind of way  And that's what  Public image is now  When you  It's from the heart  When you're so influential  And obviously you are  And were back then too  So influential  In a brand new genre of music  Where do you get your influences from 
[02:22:00]  To start something so different  And new at that time  Oh it's a healthy childhood  And like I was saying earlier  I'm just interested  In everything all the time  And I want to learn  My record collection is extensive  If anybody makes a record at all  I'm interested  Really?  Okay  I know the pressures  They go through  To put that together  So I'm deeply fascinated  With the end result  And I totally adore the effort  That it takes to get that far  So for me music  Is it's the thrill of my life 
[02:22:30]  You guys are very very  Fuck the establishment  And does it bother you  When you see a lot of bands today  Attempting  Don't you mean Fouquet  Does it bother you  When you see them  Trying to take that message  But you know  That they don't really believe it  Yeah  Well you know  You start  And then a load of bands  Try to hop on  On your kind of like  Your drive  Or the doors you're opening  And then you get  What they call  A punk movement  Which really isn't  It should have been called  Plonk  And it ends up 
[02:23:00]  You know  With nonsenses  Like what I say  Green Day  Right  They're not a punk band  Which are really  Leather jackets  On coat hangers  Of course  They're a mainstream rock band  And they keep throwing them  In that punk category  It's stupid  And I don't mean to be  Spiteful to the laddies  Because I kind of feel  Sorry for them  They're like  You know  They're like little  Garden gnomes  Bro you got something  Over there bro  They're not even  Has-beens  They want-to-beens 
[02:23:30]  But they're hugely popular  They've been successful  Yes  And good luck to them  On that level  But you know  I know I can sleep  Well at night  Yeah  I know that nothing  That I'm up to  Is stolen or taken  Or copied  From anybody  Or anything  I don't need to  Believe me  My life is full-on  Interesting  I'm more than  I don't doubt it  Were you surprised  Years ago  That your music  Took off  Especially  I mean  You were in the middle  Of disco  And arena rock 
[02:24:00]  Kind of stuff  And it was so different  All these things  By the way  I like  Yeah  You know  I do  I have no problems  With all these  Different genres  Of music  And I quite happily  Will hop and skip  Through all the categories  Really  So for me  Music  It really doesn't  Deserve labels  It's music  You know  And just enjoy it  As it is  But surprised about  Well it wasn't  Instant success  It was more like  Infamy  Yeah  True  True  If you don't mind  The pun  Infamy  They've all got it 
[02:24:30]  Infamy  I found that  I was well spoken  And outspoken  Both at the same time  And the subject matters  I choose  I mean  I'm direct  And I'm explicit  I don't mess about  With the words  You know  I go straight  To the point  Right  Yeah  And for me  My mind  I come from  The working class  Of Britain  And we view ourselves  As disenfranchised  And we're rather angry  About that  And that's  That's the drive  And the creative energy 
[02:25:00]  In me  And let me explain  In Britain  We view ourselves  As like  Well we have to  Because of the way  The society is structured  There's those that have  And there's all of us  Mixed races down there  That have not  The melting pot  Yeah  Yeah  And we don't separate  Ourselves quite the same  Way you do in America  I mean you love  Categories here  Don't you  We certainly do  Yes  Yes we do  Girls that will fuck  And girls that won't  What were you  So what were you angry about 
[02:25:30]  What was the big like  I'm pissed off  Well the opportunities  Were never there  The schooling was always  Piss poor  And you were always told  You had no opportunity  And to not bother the system  You just go along  And tow the line  And that's impossible  For someone like me  I mean like  You know  I had serious childhood illnesses  When I was young  I lost my memory  For four years  Really  So you know  For someone that loved  To read at four  That was a very  How do you  You were in the hospital  For a year right 
[02:26:00]  Weren't you in the hospital  What was the  What happened  Meningitis  Oh shit  Wow  I know  There's a part of that  Going around at the moment  Yeah  Yeah  What does meningitis do to you  I mean I know it  But I don't know what it does  It's fluid on the brain  And it just shuts down  Certain systems  And bonk  Coma  Three months of that  At seven  A year in the hospital  And I couldn't remember  My own parents  And so you know  This is this constant  Knowledge search  That for me  That's what I mean 
[02:26:30]  When I say remain a child  I'm still like that sponge  Absorbing energy  I never want to lose that  There's something to be said  That's why I don't like  Sleep too much  Yeah yeah  You're going to miss something  God damn  There's something to be said  No  The fear of not waking up  Oh is that it  Yeah  Even when you were  Even when you were younger  Yeah yeah yeah  Because you can remember  Not being able to move  You know  Fuck  Are you afraid of that  I remember them prodding you  And you not being able to move  And that never ever leaves  Ever  That's like a torture  Yeah does death scare you  No 
[02:27:00]  Death would have been an easy result  If it was that condition of immobility  That was the real challenge  You remember when they were prodding you  Because you're aware that  You know  At any age  That someone could pull the plug on you  Sure  You know  Jeez  Holy crap  So are you a bad sleeper  They call the gaffer tape  Yeah  Are you a bad sleeper as a result  Like it's hard for you to get to sleep  Yeah  Very serious sleep  Yeah  Me too  Not quite insomnia  It's a little heavier than that 
[02:27:30]  That's why I kind of  I sleep with half my brain still  You know  Going  Don't let the bastards get you  Oh man  I have to go to sleep with something on  Like a TV  I can't be left alone with my own thoughts  Oh I can't stand that  I'll never go to sleep  I don't like to listen to other people  Well I shan't be sleeping with you  For me  One of the biggest thrills  You know  Because we travel a real long time  On the tour bus  From one gig to another  Because I hate the planes  Yeah  Is just looking out the window  America  I find this  This is a country 
[02:28:00]  The most amazing place on earth  Yeah  Coming from a small nation  Yeah  The diversity  Of one state to another  And I mean  For me  That songwriting material  Right there  Right  Yeah  You're inspired by  What you see out the  Fucking bus window  Anything human beings  Get up to  Fascinates me  Is there any place  You don't like working  Like any place  You don't like doing gigs  Strip clubs  Oh really  Well I'm always first  On the bill  And I'm a bad bunny 
[02:28:30]  With a pole  Are you more optimistic  Or pessimistic  About people  When you're writing songs  Optimistic  Optimistic  I'm surprised by that  A bit  I'm pessimistic about myself  I mean  I'll write  Self debilitating songs  You know  And I'll criticize myself  And oddly enough  When people hear  Those kind of things  They think it's about them  They don't realize  That's self analysis  Oh it's about you  Because I listen to the songs  And you come off  As more cynical  And pessimistic 
[02:29:00]  About humanity  No  That's me questioning myself  Oh okay  To try and overcome  Those demons  Of self doubt  But you do have  General optimism  In humanity  Oh yeah  Wow  I've got to  I mean what's the choice  You know  Reality  Yeah  Oh okay  At least you're calling reality  I've seen reality TV  They don't work  That's not reality  That's what leads me  To believe like  We're doomed  As a species  Oh that's so easy  That's too many  Lou Reed albums  Is it  All right 
[02:29:30]  You're right  Okay  You're right  You're right  Oh god damn  Well I find that surprising though  But it's about yourself  You're always trying  You're very self critical  I think so  I think you better  Clean up your own act  Before you start  Pointing fingers  At other people  That's just the way  It is with me  When you write  Like if you want to write  Do you say  All right  I want to write  About something  And then sit down  To do it  Or will you wake up  And just go  I have to write  About this  Because I'm thinking  It just occurs  Quite naturally  You don't force yourself  Into any  Working position  Or you don't adopt  A favourite chair 
[02:30:00]  Because that's  That's not writing anymore  That's repetition  That's finding comfort  In a  You know  In boring routines  And you'll never  Ever resolve  Any  Any  Situational  Problem in  Inhumanity  Through a routine  That's not good  For creativity  You know  We are not ants  I leave that  To the Japanese  I want to ask you  About the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame  What do you think  Of the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame  You guys were inducted  Hideous fiasco  Of course  Hideous fiasco 
[02:30:30]  And you didn't  And you didn't  Show up  I didn't  Only not show up  I sent them  An extremely  Poignant letter  Oh right  I was actually there  When they read that  I went to see  Black Sabbath  Well you see  This is a  It's an institution  That cloaks itself  In secrecy  When they hold  Their ballots  You never know  Who's voting  For what  So being nominated  Is not really  An award at all  Sure  You know  It's some kind  Of skullduggery  Or smuggler  Yeah  But I mean 
[02:31:00]  You know  I've had nothing  But problems  With pistols  And pills  For 20 years  From record companies  How on earth  Am I going to  Accept an award  From that lot  Right  After they're just  Fucking you  My award would be  A decent record contract  Right  You know  And shove the rest  Of that right up  Where it hurts  We're back to pole dancing  Do you think  They put you  And so I sent  This letter  You know  And I thought  They'd get the point  Well in a weird way  They did  Because it's now  One of the main features  Of the museum  It almost backfired 
[02:31:30]  Wait a minute  Like urine in wine  Was one of the  Do you think  That they put you guys  In just because  They had to  Like a lot of times  They don't acknowledge  Things when they're happening  And then in hindsight  They had to  It was in an incorrect  Order too  There was some nonsense  With the clash  Going before us  Oh  You like the clash  Yeah but come on  They came a long time  After me  You know  They did  Yeah  They were hanging  On to the shit stains  In my old shirt  You can't take 
[02:32:00]  The Irish out of me  But he recently  Discovered toilet paper  It don't work  No no no  So do bands  Like Green Day  Know that you kind of  Like even though  They much look up to you  That you kind of  Look down at them  And go like  You're not the real thing  They expect me  To acknowledge them  And I do  But not in the way  That they would find  A program  They would like  No  I run into them  A few years ago 
[02:32:30]  It was some mad thing  At the  What was that place  The Museum of Modern Art  Here  MoMA?  Yeah  Yeah there was some  Yeah they were doing  Some thing about  British clothing  And of course  You know  I feature highly  In such activities  And Green Day  Were some of the guests  There so I just  Ran across the hall  And told them  What I thought  Oh shit  And what did you say to them  But no you have to be honest  Yeah but what did you say to them  It's not a personal attack  It's like 
[02:33:00]  Look you're fucking rubbish  You know  Wow  Right  Good for you  That must have been crushing  I'll tell you one of the great things  Of that now  Oh sod them  I've forgotten  Was running into Richard Gere  Who I found to be  Hilarious fun  Wow  You know  And I was thinking  Hamsters  Oh shit  First thought we all have  The first thing  I've always think of  Was it gerbil  I think it was a gerbil  I'd have been a gerbil  String tied around  The little thing's leg  You know he's a really good bloke  Really  He's really really funny 
[02:33:30]  I hear he likes going up to tables  And trying to get girls and women  Yeah but I mean  No seriously  As an actor  He does good work  That man  You know  And he's outside  Of the Hollywood system  Or shitstum  As we know it  Yes  And so  You know I applaud that  So he's going to get  That kind of bad press  Uh huh  Just because he walks  His own pattern  His own route  His own road  Yeah  And that's you know  Made a road rise with you  For anybody that stands up  And faces this world  As an individual  Gets my applause 
[02:34:00]  And always be wary  Of the put down bad press  Unless he gets  The more  The more that  They spread these kind of rumours  It means the more  That what you're doing  Really matters  But you don't give a shit  About the press  Well of course I do  They can have all the shit  I've got to offer  There is a certain freedom  In them  Like knowing  What you're all about  And you kind of  Putting it out there  Because there's no secrets  There's no stress  Of having to hide something  It would be a shame  If the media  Would  Well it is a shame 
[02:34:30]  Because they tend not  To write the truth  Too often  And it doesn't seem  To be much of a legal  Representation  For individuals  Out there  Well they can put  Allegedly  That's why  You have to run the gauntlet  And yes I understand  Well you ask for it  Right  You're big loud  Mouth famous  Etc  Yeah  Six of one  Half a dozen  Of the other  I think I can cope with it  But I know a few people  Out there that haven't  Over the years  Yeah  And they tend to go  Into the self pity  And go church mousy  And then the drug habits 
[02:35:00]  Start creeping in  And the alcohol  Right right  You know  It's very difficult  To try and like  Because I discipline myself  Really well  You know  I understand that drugs  Are a wonderful  Source of entertainment  And not a problem at all  And it's the same  With alcohol  Because you know  I know the limitations  And I know that  It's all about social  For me  And I don't lock myself away  But many artists  Are very very 
[02:35:30]  Very temperamental  Yeah  Touchy  Did you get yourself in trouble  I wish that they would  Socialise more  And kick that weakness  Out of themselves  When you were younger  Did you get yourself  In trouble with  Fame and success  Oh what do you think  Well I assume yes  But I do assume yes  Oh I was like  Ping pong with the jail system  Yeah  And then I became  Unpopular  Which actually  That's when all the  Trouble stopped  Really  Yeah  Because I found  Something to do  Songwriting 
[02:36:00]  Yeah  Interesting  Because  I just  I would assume  That it was more  The lifestyle  And getting popular  As a musician  Oh no  That would get you  In trouble  Oh no no no  I was a bad bunny  From a very early age  Okay  So even before  Yeah  You said something  I'd hit the aspirin  At 12  Jeez  You said something  In a drug  That was  Yeah I assumed  The aspirin  Nom de plume  Nom de plume  Of drugs 
[02:36:30]  I saw  What has to be  Discreet  Of course  I wouldn't have it  Any other way  You did a panel  On legalizing drugs  Which I saw  Which was really interesting  Yeah  And you talked about  How you think  That the problem  Is that information  Is withheld  Yeah  Yeah  If  I think if young kids  Knew  The real content  And the results  Of some of the things  They're shoving into themselves  Like bath salts  Right yeah  You know  This is  You really need to know  What you're doing here  You cause less problems 
[02:37:00]  I'm all for transparency  Of information  On everything  I wanted pregnancies  The lot  Because  You're just causing problems  By denying knowledge  To young people  I mean we're back at that again  This is my constant  Right right  You know  So I mean even in a song  Like One Drop  I say we're the ageless  We're teenagers  This is how I feel in life  Yeah  And so here I am  I'm declaring  I think all information  Should be readily available  People confuse that  With condoning  Things though  And it is religion 
[02:37:30]  That's getting in here  And somehow  Casting aspersions on us  Of what we should  And shouldn't be knowing  It's like limiting  The English language  And reducing certain words  Out of it  Because they've got  A naughty saucy context  Right right  Yeah  You know  People do confuse that  I'm an Anglo-Saxon  Kel  I say what I like  And bollocks  People do confuse  Giving people knowledge  With condoning stuff  Yes  So that's why  They try to keep it  Which is quite the opposite  It's stupid  You see there goes 
[02:38:00]  A moralistic value  That's got to be stopped  Because I don't need  Somebody else's morals  To decide  What's right or wrong for me  I need the information  And I'm more than capable  Of making the right decision  Of making the right decision  Somehow I don't think  People are getting confused  With the fact that you might  That's a bit logical  Listen to somebody else  It's too logical  I think we're past the point  Of thinking you might  Listen to somebody  I've done my listening  Yeah  No shit man  Stand in line  What do you think  It was about you guys  Two or you in particular  That the people just 
[02:38:30]  Oh yeah  I know you  Jim Brewer  Jim Brewer  You were on Saturday night  Yeah I know sir  Hey  Goat boy  That's fantastic  How hilarious  He was just asking goat boy  For some more coffee  He did turn to goat boy  And ask for a cup of coffee  And then realised  It was Jim Brewer  Roll and drink  Roll and  Oh it lives  John needs some more coffee please 
[02:39:00]  Yes I do  Yes  Are you a big coffee drinker  Get that energy level up  Not really  But I mean it's early  In the morning isn't it  You've got to have something  You know  Put a rev in your bum  You've got to do something  Are you doing a lot of live shows  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah yeah  Currently on tour  Where are you playing  All over  We just played last night  In Williamsburg  It was just  How'd it go  Wonderful little fair  Yeah  Brilliant atmosphere that place  What are the crowds like  Now 
[02:39:30]  What  Adorable  Adorable  Yes  Do you get fans from  No it's a pill zone  People come for the right attitude  Yeah  All the dogs  Are outside in the street  In here  In our house  We call it  It's a  It's a house of love  And friendship  Nice  Yes and sharing  And generosity  Of mind and spirit  It's a proper rave  Yeah  With a paddy shindig thrown in  With a Turkish folk  Band 
[02:40:00]  At a Greek wedding  Sounds fantastic  And a pizza on the menu  And you're performing  Let me plug a couple of your dates  Here in New York  At the Hammerstein Ballroom  Nice  This October 13th  Which I think  That's Saturday  And in Boston  At the Royale  Boston  October the 15th  And there's dates  All up and down  You can go to  Pill's website  Because they have  San Francisco  Chicago  Toronto  Montreal  All these places  You're going to see the country  Yeah yeah  And Canada too 
[02:40:30]  And you don't fly  Nah  Those bus rides  I know you love America  I love them  I love them  I love them  You're such a brilliant country  Yeah  You should see all of it  Every chance you get  Yeah  Yeah  Except maybe around Chicago  Because it's a little  On the industrial side  True  True  It's one of the most  Surprising things  When you leave Chicago  Late at night  After a gig  And you see the beautiful  Colors  And the sky 
[02:41:00]  And the dark  And you realise  That's all industrial waste  Being pumped into the air  Put a little  It's death  A little starlight  Through it  It looks great  It's death  Really well lit  Well lit death  America does it so well  Did you see yourself  Still touring  At your age now  When you were growing up  And just started getting into it  I don't know  When you're 16 and 17  As you can see  Very much farther  Beyond the end of your nose 
[02:41:30]  True  Yeah  That's one of the joys  And problems  Of being a teenager  Isn't it  Yeah  You grow out  Of being just selfish  Because you have to  Share the world  With other people  Yeah  Did you see  And I can't wait  To share myself  With all of you  I  Was  I  Fucking  Love  John is a blast  John rules  God damn  Hey  Is it  You fucking rule 
[02:42:00]  Is it  Harder  Is it  I'm here  Goat boy  I've got a pair  Of Wellingtons  Goat boy  Just call him  Goat boy  It's great  It's great  Fucking love it  It's so funny  Is it harder  As you go on  To kind of  Remain true  To who you are  As you get older  And more successful  No  No  Because your friends  And your family  Particularly my wife  I mean  They keep you  You know  Well level headed  How long have you been married  Nora  You know  It's like 
[02:42:30]  It's the frying pan  On the back of the skull  If I get too bad  You know  Enough of your shit  You've ever heard  The old cartoon  Al kabong  Oh yeah  Yeah  It was  Fucking  The horse with the mask  Yes  And I know the banjo  Al kabong  Yeah  Well that's it  If I'm in at 4am  So hence the early nights  But you do that  You know  Because you are  You're sharing your life  With other people  And you've got to do that  And of course  I've got grandkids  And things like that 
[02:43:00]  So it's family  You've got grandkids  Wow  How long have you been married  Oh nearly 30 years  Wow  Yeah  I know  I'm John  I don't make commitments lightly  No shit huh  Good for you  30 years  But is that  I'm like super glue  You can't get rid of me  No  Apparently not  Yes  And you like the fact  That you're married to somebody  That kind of just  That doesn't  Yeah because we're so different  Right  See  Totally different people  And view everything differently  And so  Everything is sort of 
[02:43:30]  A semi-argument  But it isn't really  It's like a debate  Which is healthy  It is  Because I mean  She'll watch all those  Like Ian  Entertainment  Horrible things  Oh no  But she'll feed me  The lines I need to know  You've got the filtered version  You've got to go through all of it  Yeah  And that's rather good  The filtered version  Yeah  Yes  Absolutely  What kind of music  Does she listen to  Anything with Ryan Seacrest on  Is a problem for me  What kind of music 
[02:44:00]  Does she listen to  I'm a big fan  Well that eliminates  Three quarters of TV  Doesn't it  Exactly  He's on everything  His radio stuff is really good  I think he's terrific  The New Year's Eve thing  He does a delightful job  With Ryan Seacrest  There's everything you need  To know about America  He stinks  Yeah  But we all fucking  Gobble it up  What kind of music  Does your wife listen to  Oh my god  She's into the Rihannas  And things  You see  That is so weird  Soft R&B stuff  Yeah  Which is kind of odd for me 
[02:44:30]  Because you know  I've listened to a lot  Of the back beats  And the samples  And I'm going  Uh huh  That sounds like  Old public image  Oh right  Okay  You know  You know  You know  It's true  Oh yeah  You're hearing shit  But yeah  Yeah  Yeah  All the way through rap  Through all of it  Does it bother you  Or do you like  That you've been influential  No look  It's a good thing  It means  You know  That music sounds better  You know  It sounds more like  How I like it to be  But unfortunately  There's no royalties  Or money in it 
[02:45:00]  Right  Yeah  That's the missing bit  Did you feel  With the pistols  That the image  Was transcending  What you wanted to do musically  Like that was taking  The front center stage  No  No  Never  No  Like kind of a freak show  Almost  No  No  It became kind of sad  Because of  You know  Certain members  Like getting involved  With silliness  In drug habits  And stuff  And so that  That became  An emotional  Problem  Yeah  Yeah  But never overtaking  The band 
[02:45:30]  I mean  It reached a point  There  I just said  To an audience  In San Francisco  Ever get the feeling  You've been cheated  Because I felt cheated  Out of it  And that was it  Goodbye  Wow really  I think I've seen that video  That's on video right  You can actually see that  Didn't I  That's just the end  I thought that was  The best use of the film  Or ever  Wow man  Really  That was it  Yeah  Hey did you  You know  So I eliminated that  Jefferson aeroplane  Somebody has to do that 
[02:46:00]  Around here  You don't have any  Sacred cows  In the music business  Oh  How is Adele  Scal  Scal  It's a fucking fat joke  She is a fatty  Holy fuck  It's pretty quick  It's pretty quick  I love it  I fucking love it man  Were you a Beatles guy  Or did you not  No  No  My mom and dad  Loved the Beatles 
[02:46:30]  And it used to  Drive me crazy  You know  Sometimes your parents  Can turn you off  Things accidentally  But you know  Other things  Like they loved  But I turned  Them on too  I mean I got my mom  Really interested  In Alice Cooper  Really  Yeah  And you were into  Alice Cooper apparently  Yeah well you know  Just for the laugh of it  Right right  I don't mind watching  Blokes dangling on piano wires  Yeah yeah  Well that's somebody  Whose stage show  And persona  Overtook any music  That he really made 
[02:47:00]  Yeah but in a hilarious  Innocent kind of  Like happy way  And it fit with the time  No I would always  Love Alice  And he's a great  Great bloke to me  And you know  Just really easy  He's very into golf  I hear  That's the sadness  Yeah yeah  That made me go like  Really  That visual of  Bing Crosby  And Alice Cooper  Yes  Putting little balls  About which  Sticks  Isn't that just  An odd thing  When I found out  He golfed  I was a little  Taken aback myself  Well that explains  The Ryder Cup situation  We lost the Ryder Cup 
[02:47:30]  To that  Yeah yeah  I saw  Did you lose it  Oh my gosh  I saw Pears  Tweeting about that  Got her ass kicked  Who won it then  Who won the Ryder Cup  I don't know  I have no idea  Oh yeah  I saw Pears  We had a big  Throwing about that  We had a big lead  And you kicked our ass  Wait is the Ryder Cup golf  Yeah  Oh boy  America versus like  The world basically  Yeah  Well it ain't NASCAR  Yeah  Do you 
[02:48:00]  Are you into social media  At all  Twitter or  No  No  No  I know  You know  Obviously  Somebody around me  Uses it  But I ain't gonna  Spend the rest of my life  Like attached to a  Silly phone  Telling someone  I've just woke up  I fancy a cup of coffee  Oh dear  Exactly  The toilet seat fell  I've got a bruise  It's so self important  And at the same time  Unimportant completely  It definitely fits your persona  Not getting involved 
[02:48:30]  Yeah  No  You don't need to do that  But he would have a lot to say  He would be a good one to follow  You'd be a very entertaining guy to follow  If you just spoke your mind  It'd be fun  Yeah man  Because you wouldn't be talking about that shit  And I know people  They get addicted to it  So they end up having no life at all  Talking about the life  That they're planning  Just live  That's brilliant  Yes  Just live your life  We were talking about  How people go to concerts  Yeah  And they hold their phones up  And they're taping stuff  And it's like  It's right in front of you  Drives me mental 
[02:49:00]  Watch it you dummy  Drives me mental  Yeah  So going  The old fashioned version  Used to be going on holiday  And spending all day  In a hotel room  Writing postcards  Of wish you were here  Right  Right  Well you know  Where  Writing postcards  Yeah but exactly that  It's so annoying  Holding up them  Bleeding cell phones  Snapping pictures  Or whatever  People are seeing the real experience  They're too busy recording  What they're doing  And not doing what they're doing  Well that's so you can watch it later 
[02:49:30]  Yeah exactly  You gotta watch it later  Word  Living vicariously  Vicariously  Isn't that a nasty word  You never want to live vicariously  No you do not  You want to live victoriously  Yes  God damn  He's right  That's amazing  We're learning  We're learning  What is it about you guys  You think that the public  Gravitated to  Because the whole fucking  Young people just loved you guys  It must have been the underwear  If you ask me  Do you think it was the message  Or the fact that you were saying  Fuck you 
[02:50:00]  And they couldn't say fuck you  No  It wasn't as trivial as that  It's  It's  It's the voice of hope  You know  I mean I've never been like  Offering like death and sadness  And murder and mayhem  To the world  For me revolution is a passive thing  It's  I believe in  Philosophically  Gandhi  Passive resistance  You can make a system collapse  Just by not contributing to it  That's  That's the most correct way 
[02:50:30]  And I think  Philosophically  In the history of mankind  That that Gandhi message  Has been the absolute  Almost importantist  Do you think that people  Because I don't believe in the bibble  The bibble  The drivel of the bibble  Do you think a lot of people  Misunderstood that though  Because I think a lot of people  Had more of the impression  That you were for  Violence  And  Yeah yeah  Well that's utter nonsense isn't it  Because there's no evidence  To back that  Right right  I think people had that impression though  For some reason  You know  Am I violent because of police harassment  Well damn right 
[02:51:00]  But that's a different agenda  Do you feel you were targeted  Because of your  You know  Not all of us go to prison  Willingly  Do you feel you were targeted  Because of who you were  Yes yes  Like I said earlier  If you stand up  And you're loud and proud  About what it is  You're offering the world  You're putting your head  In a weird way  In a chopping block  You expect to take those knocks  But enough of the important stuff  That there is that hard core of people  That understand what it is you're saying 
[02:51:30]  And they'll take that message  And expand that into their universes  And slowly but surely  Good influence all round  You could call that zen if you like  Sure sure  You know  It sounds a lot more reasonable  Than I think people had the impression of you  Years ago  I haven't shot you dead yet  I've had every opportunity  Come on now  He is quite reasonable  I am  Johnny Romantico here  Is there anything that you didn't 
[02:52:00]  Like that you looked at in the establishment  That you hated when you were younger  That like as time has gone on  The fact that I had no place in it  I hated that  And then I grew up realising  I really didn't want to  Yeah  And you know  I don't mind contributing to society as a whole  I don't mind paying my tax  And I believe in looking out for people  That are less fortunate than me  I have no problems with that  But I won't take dictates and mandates 
[02:52:30]  And rules and regulations  That I think stifle my personal freedoms  So I'm a curious blend of  Well I don't know  What was the American politics  Sort of libertarian  With a touch of  No I can't stand that bunch  Really  They're so freaky weird  They do come off as weirdo  They are for less government up your ass  Yeah  I'm totally for less government  Yeah  But I'm totally for caring for those less fortunate  Right  So I'm a cross between the two  Yeah  No I'm not sitting on a fence 
[02:53:00]  Not with his face  No  Very painful  I think a lot of people  Again  I think most people think like I do  And I don't like the extremism of far left far right  But that's the categories that we were talking about earlier  That Americans seem to love  And who's telling us that that's it  Well why should I accept that  Yeah  Sod them all  You've seen that political debate the other week  Yeah  Obama and Robin  That was the most dullest thing  Of course it was  Really  That's a crime against nature  Yeah  And I didn't pay for that  I still want my money back 
[02:53:30]  Too stiffs  Yeah  I think a lot more people are a mixture  They pick and choose of what you like  Some people are conservative  But is it our fault though  That we're demanding this to be an entertaining kind of podium  It doesn't  It's not supposed to be  Are we pushing it into that  Yes  Or is it being shoved down your throat  Yeah  A beauty contest  A popularity contest  Nothing to do with the actual ability to lead  Or  No  Yeah  And wanting to classify people  What's that phrase  Zingers  Yeah  They wanted zingers 
[02:54:00]  Soundbites  I don't want a president that can deliver zingers  Well that's what Americans need  Soundbites and zingers  Yeah  Yeah  We're all about that  What in the phrase zinger  That's a kind of a fairly new one  Isn't it  Oh I think that's  Real zinger  Well he's got a real zinger  I think vaudeville  Oh maybe it's me  I always thought it was something to do with zits and spots  Yeah you've got a zinger  You know when you burst a real good butterball  Butterball  That's a zinger  Oh that's horrible  You smell really good by the way 
[02:54:30]  Oh wow  He has great cologne  Christian Dior  A true gentleman  Well when you don't wash you've got to do something  Iraq is telling us you have to go because you've got to wrap up  You're a busy man  Busy busy  Very busy  Yeah and I'm going to be recording back here in a few hours  Really?

[03:03:00]  Late night  Once in the life  I like when they write  Your stuff  They write a movie  Where I had three lines in it  Yeah  Oh really  I didn't even have a line  I was  I was in  Once in the life  I literally was  In a pizza place  And a guy comes up  And he goes  Can I get a pizza  I go what  And he goes  Can I get a pizza  I said hold on a second  And he takes the pizza  I go what the fuck is wrong  And he grabs me  Pulls me over the counter  Beats the shit out of me  Jim Brewer has seen  As once in a life  Starring in 
[03:03:30]  Starring in  He was the crow  And zookeeper  The role of a lifetime  But what about us  When we're at Caroline's  Or something  They'll go  You know  He's hurt on Opie and Anthony  And the guy walks out  We don't even know who it is  Like who is this  I've never heard of this guy  He might have called in  One time as a listener  You might have heard him  On Opie and Anthony  Boy I always have to do that  But then again  You might not have  So he might have  It's true  You might have  Yes you're right  You're 
[03:04:00]  Can I bring this up  The fans are  It's like going to  Our fans  Yes  It's like going to  A ball game  Yeah  And it's like the Mets  Against  Like whenever there's  An in-city rival team  Uh huh  Because someone will shout  Something out  From somewhere else  And then your team  Will immediately like  O&A  Well we love them for that 
[03:04:30]  And then literally  We do love them for that  And they'll go back and forth  And they'll go  Alright alright  Jim Brewer  Let's get back to the show  Let's get back to the show  Fuckers  People know you from  A couple different places  It's entertaining  Yes  Dude I figured  I did the tally  I've been coming here  For almost 14 years  Come on  Holy shit  To this building  Long before we were even here  13 years  Opie and Anthony  Yeah  From N.E.W.  Back in 99  The end of like 98, 99 
[03:05:00]  Dude  Yeah but I used to have him  On the B.A.B. show  So I go  Wow  Further back and forth  Oh really  Yeah  A couple times on the B.A.B. show  Back in Strong Island  Strong Island  Wow  Hey can I ask you something  So uh  Strong Island's over rock and roll  I'm a mere two years out  From having to put my kid  In a school  And I know you're home school  Yeah  I'm starting to think  That might be the way to go  I don't want to deal with this shit  Is your wife home all day?  Uh  Yeah  Here and there  She's got her things  She's only going to be home  Until you get home  And then we  Here  Here's where kids learn 
[03:05:30]  Well  Here's the thing  With homeschooling  Do you regret it?  Hell no  Oh good  Not at all  I get to travel  We've seen  The cities  Worlds  Countries  Worlds  Like we're going  Fucking rocket ship  What's that?  I've spent more valuable time  Talking about real life  Uh huh  With her  Than I ever would  Uh  Going to school  Or whatever  School is  You know  Some people  Yeah  Some people know 
[03:06:00]  You sit in a fucking classroom  For 40 minutes  To let  My kids in second grade  They're shoving Ponce de Leon  Who the fuck  In seven hundreds  When Ponce de Leon  Fuck  It's  All that shit  You don't give a fuck about  Who gives a fuck  Teach them how to  Wait wait  To fix a roof  So one of your kids  Is in  Is in public school  Two of them are  One's not  Oh I see  Private baby  Private  Oh yeah yeah  Two in private  And one homeschooled  One homeschooled 
[03:06:30]  However the homeschool one  You're running an experiment  Over there  Should go back  He kind of is  Don't go and stop  Let's see what works  Pretty much  But you know  At the end of the day too  You're  Like what do kids learn  When you're at school  Yeah  People fight with the socialism shit  What about socialism  You're not taking a kid  And sticking them in a fucking closet  My kids are around other kids  More than they would  At school  They're around  People they want to be more  She's in  She's in a rock band  She's in 
[03:07:00]  She's in two different  Music groups  She's in fucking  Soccer  She's in basketball  So it's not like  She's not in with groups  Every weekend  She's with this one  They go to the shore house  So it's not like she's being  Socially fucking retarded  It's um  There is a stereotype  Of homeschool  Yeah  It's just  Oh god  Socialism  No that's for the guy  Who lives upstate New York  And the next neighbor  Is 50 miles away  Right right  Yeah then I'd say  There's a socialism problem  We're homeschooling the children 
[03:07:30]  Right  We don't appreciate the curriculum  That they're putting our child through  They live in a trailer  Out in the middle of nowhere  If you're slow in school  They push pills now  That's everything is push pills  And that's because  You know  It's  It's  Pharmaceutical  We have ways of making you think  The way we want you to make  Oh you sound like Bill Burr now  We have  We have ways to make you  And stick to the system  Jesus Jim  To watch the television 
[03:08:00]  And you stick to the social things  That we shove down your throat  That you will listen to  We have a plan  That you must be part of the execution  On stage  They just figured out  How to do it through mass media  School makes no sense whatsoever  At the end of the day  You tell me one thing  Grade  Zero  Through fucking nine  That makes any sense  That you're learning  That's valuable  And don't give me the bullshit  You learn to be around other people 
[03:08:30]  Nope  Just basic math and shit  I think  You know  And then you have to  Plus minus  Yeah you gotta continue  With these math classes  That mean nothing  When you get older  I learned the three R's  Ah  Right  Plus minus  Divide  Multiply  That show's over  That's all you fucking need  And if you start  You see your kids  Start getting fucking weird  When they're little  If you start staring  At airplanes a lot  And shit  Then yeah  Put him in school  And then he needs  To start going to science  Cause he's got a little cell  That's a little off  And he needs to  Pursue that 
[03:09:00]  Your kid will always tell you  What they want to learn about  Of course  Kids want to learn  They want to fucking learn  They don't want to learn bullshit  They just don't want to learn bullshit  Do you do it like  For X amount of hours a day  Is there a time schedule  Or how do you do it  No time schedule  To get up  Well  We  Trial and ever  Trial and ever  How great would that be  Imagine if we were homeschooled  Growing up  How great would that be  Wasn't even an option  Holy fuck  Wasn't even an option  Math  She's done in like 
[03:09:30]  An hour  But she's done with like  Three chapters  Where that takes  Six months in school  History  You know  The shit they're teaching you  In history  Is such horse shit  I go you want to learn history  Here let's what  Let's talk to grandpas  In world war two  And shit  And learn about depression  And we'll talk about  So it's like  And everything nowadays  Is on your fucking phone  Yeah  Google  It has  Ten times the amount  Of information  Than the stupid books  They're handing kids 
[03:10:00]  So why are they forcing  Kids to memorize shit  When we now have Google  Because you must be  A part of the system  Because they can't  Figure out how to  Reinvent themselves  Is the problem  They can't  If they figure out  How to reinvent  It's time to reinvent  The whole schooling system  But they're not ready  To do that  It really is  Because you're right  If you have access  To all this info  On your phone  Why the fuck  Would you have to  Memorize it  Then I'd rather  Send my kid to be  Babysat  At somewhere  For certain hours  Where I can't be around  But I'd rather  Them learning something  They want to do  Instead  Let them learn something else  Years ago  When you were home  Years ago 
[03:10:30]  When I was growing up  And you needed  To know something  You were fucked  Fucked  You were just fucked  I had encyclopedias  Even those  Even then  They were so boring  And there was some  Kind of  There was some questions  That the answer  Wasn't in  The encyclopedia  I found them  I found them  Yeah that fucking  Tahitian  You'd find them  In the weirdest places  But you would find them  Looked like Tahiti  My dad had them  From the Philippines  And some of the islands  From his war book  And there'd be a whole tribe  With like big boobies  And they'd be like 
[03:11:00]  Why are you  Stop taking  For a pen  Fascinating  With a pen  But you were  You were fucked  But not anymore  Like you didn't  I remember calling friends  And going like  Brrring  Brrring  Brrring  Wait for it to ring  Ten times  Because he's fucking  Running across the house  No answering machines  No answering machines  You just have to let it  Ring ring ring  Until someone picked up  And then it's like  Dude remember that movie  With that guy  And he was doing that thing  That 
[03:11:30]  And you just didn't  Fucking get an answer  You didn't need to know  Nothing  At the end of the day  You don't even care  Who cares  Who cares  You need to know  We're putting too much information here  IMDB  Too much  IMDB  But  Easy direction we're going  We cannot stop  We'll see what happens  We cannot stop  They need to do something  As Ray Kurzweil said  Eventually we will all just kind of  We will have  Whatever the next step in Google is  You'll just  It'll anticipate what you want  And you'll be able to think it  And you'll just know it  Yes  I think it's a good thing though  And I also think it's a great checks and balances system 
[03:12:00]  Because people can't get away with shit like they used to  Because everybody knows it immediately  Yeah  Like you  If you fuck around  Years and years and years ago  You'd get away with a lot  Right  But I mean even people in power now  Everybody is being reduced to the same level  Because information is thrown out there  You know how easy plagiarism was years ago  Yes I know  Like plagiarism  I used an Aussie song as a fucking  As a poem in fucking  A sophomore in high school  I turned in Revelation Mother Earth  Like I wrote it  Like it was yours  And I got a B  I got a B 
[03:12:30]  A B  They didn't like Aussie's writing  Holy shit  They knew I stole it  Because I was writing choruses  But you could plagiarize anything back then  No one fucking knew  You couldn't pop a sentence from it  Into a search engine  And come up with the entire fucking thing  That you stole  Yeah  Now it's like  Fuck you're fucked  Dude  Last night  My daughter asked me to help her  With whatever  And she asked me this phrase  She's like  What is the  I have to define what this phrase was  And the phrase was like  And the mouse was frozen in the panthers 
[03:13:00]  Whatever the fuck the phrase was  So I went  I have  You know what  Let me google this phrase  And the phrase shows you what book it's in  What it came from  What the origins  Where it started from  A million different phrases  Yeah  And define it  Here's how you define it  Right  Here's how you use it  Why does she need a book  I said  Here  Take my phone  It's right there  Well they can't even figure out  How to put the fucking textbooks  You know  In a phone  They still gotta carry the books  Right  So stupid 
[03:13:30]  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  The books are  Like  I think that's a responsibility thing  I don't know  It's just all stupid  Where it's like  Where it's like  You gotta  You have to  Remember your books  Like  You have to remember  To bring them  Yes  It's part of the rules  Of just  This is your responsibility  We're teaching you  Now it's in the book so much  That you just gotta bring the book  If you can afford an iPad  Why can't you send your kid  To school with an iPad  And all the books are on it  Exactly  Eventually that will happen  Eventually that will happen  It should happen now  We got the technology 
[03:14:00]  It's so stupid  I see these kids  They're like  Three foot high  And they got 100 pounds  Of books on their back  Yeah but then the kid  Will be like  I've forgotten my charger  And he'll be like  You knew you had to bring it  Yeah true  It'll always be something  It'll always be something  Right  Do you got an app?  Can I borrow an app?  Yeah  They may not want you  To have access to everything  While you're in school either  Like if you're on your iPad  All the time  You know  You wouldn't be learning  Your lessons  You'd probably be looking  At rock and roll  Or whatever  Oh boy  Or clip pictures  Yeah  I don't know  I don't know what the answer is 
[03:14:30]  But it's obviously  There's gotta be  Some drastic change  And teach real shit  Yeah  Who gives a shit  About Ponzi  I wish someone taught me  How to fix a toilet  Or  Put a wax ring in the floor  Seriously  So the shit don't leak  Or  How to debate with kids  Or  I mean  It's probably hack  But how to do a mortgage  I didn't fucking know  Mortgage  Yeah  That would be a week of school  So you know  What the fuck is going on  Life shit  Life shit  Life shit  You don't get out of high school  And go what?  Yeah  No no no  You're not going to school  I'm going to life shit school 
[03:15:00]  Life shit  How great would that be  Life shit  I'm in LS high school  Life shit  Life shit  Life shit high school  Have you heard of it?  This week I'm learning  How to debate my wife  And we're going to be able  To fix the backyard  Spending less than $300  Very fucking useful  Holy shit  That's scary as a parent  Yeah  Ponce de Leon  I remember we had to learn  About the French Revolution  Who gives a fuck  Who cares  Who gives a shit  Why do I have to learn that shit  You know what bothers me  And I'm sure 
[03:15:30]  Any debate  I don't get into debates  And all that shit  Whenever someone says  Our forefathers  You're a big forefather  Oh boy  Who gives a fuck  There is  400 years ago  They're not fucking around anymore  It's time for new forefathers  Who says  It can't be new forefathers  New fucking forefathers  Well the forefathers say  Well the forefathers are fucking dead  300 fucking years  Bye bye  That's it  They probably didn't even wear  Underpants  They didn't even know  What the fucking Yankees were  So who gives a shit  About the forefathers 
[03:16:00]  They didn't know  We'd be able to google shit  No more forefathers  The problem with history  It's not knowing these things  It's the slant put on them  When they're taught to you  Yes  Like knowing  Your history  Is an advantage  Because you kind of  You get a better world view  Of what people had to go through  But the problem is  The bias  Whatever side it's coming from  Right  That's put into it  Right  Not just the facts  Like world  World war  I didn't  We just know our version  Yeah the Japanese don't teach  We were sneaks 
[03:16:30]  In world war 2  They have a different spin  What are they  Right  What are they teaching  We were sneaks  They pushed us into it  We dropped bombs  And all of a sudden  We're the bad guys  Right  We just fish  We just fishermen  Yeah  You're so right  Yeah  And then Australians  Will say like  We get no credit  And we're the ones  That were the most important part  Of the world war  Right  Right  The Philippines  We're the ones  That really won  The Philippines  I were trying to get 
[03:17:00]  To Australia  Yeah they were  The Japs  It's like  We were the ones  That really helped out  Yeah the Americans  Don't give all the credit  Who you think  Bailed out New Guinea  It was us  Right  Yeah  Humanities  Humanities  I can't even say  The fucking island  But yeah  We protected all the gateways  To the United States  If it wasn't for us  They'd have landed strips  Everywhere  Right  Give me a blooming onion  And shut up  Yeah  Get home for that  Yeah well
