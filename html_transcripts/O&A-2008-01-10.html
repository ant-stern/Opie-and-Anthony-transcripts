<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a chaotic scene: a possibly staged altercation between show staff (Roland hitting Dave with a paddle), immediately followed by a discussion about their controversial radio style.  The hosts then veered into a discussion of Britney Spears's unexpected New York City appearance, generating inappropriate jokes and reminiscing about past stunts, including a listener-encouraged kidnapping of a 7-Eleven worker and a goat-related promotion. This transitioned into a deep dive into an obscure song, focusing on the singer's unique vocal style before revealing the artist's identity.  They also subjected a photo of Kim Cattrall to harsh, crude criticism.  Dr. Phil's handling of the Britney Spears situation received similarly harsh criticism.  The impending (and ultimately failed) calls from Donald Trump and Ice Cube were discussed, alongside the hosts' celebration of their #2 (later #1) ranking in the 18-49 male demographic.

The controversy surrounding Kelly Tillman's racially insensitive joke about Tiger Woods and Reverend Al Sharpton's response was heavily debated, with the hosts expressing strong negative opinions of Sharpton.  A story about an 84-year-old man, Eugene Old, receiving a parking ticket while helping his disabled wife led to a discussion about NYC meter maids' practices, including a call with a former NYPD psychologist.  Bob Kelly was briefly mentioned as a guest performing at Caroline's.  A call from a retired police officer, Garrett, criticizing simplified traffic ticketing procedures followed.  Eugene Old himself then called in, detailing his ordeal and his WWII experiences; the hosts offered to pay half his ticket.

The show then played a recording of Val Kilmer singing "After the Gold Rush," followed by comedic staff renditions. Val Kilmer's singing and acting were discussed, transitioning into humorous anecdotes about the hosts' Call of Duty 4 experiences with their clan, "GAY,"  and their online gameplay styles. This segued into a news story about two men wheeling their dead roommate's body to cash a check, sparking ironic commentary, particularly about the news report's description of the event as "elaborate,"  with Bob Kelly as a guest contributing to the discussion.  Bob Kelly,  a frequent guest throughout the broadcast, described his new high-tech bidet, prompting further ribald humor and anecdotes.  The hosts also played a Val Kilmer "After the Gold Rush" supermix and engaged in a game of war movie puns substituting food and weight-related terms, often targeting Bob Kelly’s weight. Trump and Ice Cube’s cancelled appearances were also addressed.  The segment ended with promotion of Bob Kelly's show and discussion of upcoming appearances.

A later segment devolved into sexually explicit discussions of sexual acts and preferences, featuring graphic descriptions and fetishes, involving Opie, Anthony, Bob Kelly, and Jim Norton. The conversation included further bidet discussions and crude commentary.  This was interspersed with discussions of professional wrestling, specifically The Rock, using offensive language.  AJ Poopy Shits, a recurring character, delivered an explicitly sexual entertainment update and later appeared for a studio interview, continuing the sexually explicit humor.  Feedback from program director Tom Chiasano, suggesting music and sound effects, was reviewed, with the hosts reacting with varying levels of amusement and annoyance.

A final segment featured Patrice and Jimmy as guests, in a back-and-forth described as everyone being “fucking assholes” to each other. A “line of the day” segment included jokes about weight, the Brondell bidet, and the Apocalypse Cow.  Discussion of a listener winning money from Bodogfantasy.net, criticism of its advertising, a pre-recorded bit of Tom, and a “blow off” and publicity stunt involving a Springer guest followed. The “line of the day,” "Gotta just shut the half up,"  referencing the Golf Channel protest, was announced. The closing moments included a listener call mentioning childhood sexual abuse and unintelligible speech.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their options.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to your socks?  I don't know what happened.  Oh my God. Oh my God.  He's doing it now. His skin is completely black.  Oh my God.  This is where entertainment is going.  Oh my God.  Oh, Roland's got a paddle.  Oh my God. 
[00:01:00]  Roland is kicking Dave's ass.  Who saw this coming?  They are sick freaks.  One, two, three.  Go.  B-Rock is attempting.  Oh my God.  Give us a thumbs up if you're alright.  Shut up.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah. 
[00:01:30]  Howdy.  I'm hoping someone's alarm is going off right now.  Oh God.  That's got to be so annoying.  Wake up.  Time to go to your loser job.  Wake up.  Time to go to your loser job.  Hey, that was me.  You sit at the edge of your bed and go, oh, this sucks. 
[00:02:00]  That's what I did for many years.  I still do that.  Hey, we're very excited today because we just learned that Britney Spears is somewhere in New York City.  And we're going to find her.  And we're going to kidnap her.  And we're going to get her the help that she needs.  No, we're not.  We hope she dies in New York City.  You want to see that news camera view of the sheet coming out of the gurney? 
[00:02:30]  I want to see body bag footage, yeah.  Where the belly's bloated for whatever reason.  Out of some hotel.  Yeah, some just awful hotel.  The Chelsea Hotel.  She's in town, though.  We're trying to figure out what to do with Britney Spears.  I was thinking of offering some cold hard cash to the person that brings Britney to us. 
[00:03:00]  That's like kidnapping, huh?  Wouldn't be the first time we did a kidnapping bid on our show.  You know that.  I know.  I was there.  You were part of the Nighttime Attitudes kidnapping show.  Bring us a 7-Eleven convenience store worker.  Worked.  People showed up.  And the workers had no clue why they were there.  That will be in the book.  Yeah.  You've got to write about the time you actually encouraged your listeners to kidnap pretty much a 7-Eleven worker. 
[00:03:30]  Could you imagine doing this bit today?  This bit we actually did, Anthony and I, way back when we first started.  I had some stupid Grateful Dead tickets to give away.  And I said, all right, look.  We had people bring in animals for the tickets.  Yeah, yeah.  That was the famous goat thing.  When the goat did its business all over the floor.  Is that picture still on the internet somewhere?  I don't know.  It's probably buried deep in foundry music. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, I'm sure.  Buried.  Very, very deep.  Of you with a massive afro getting, you know what, in the, you know what.  Head butted.  Head butted in the you know what.  Because someone brought that in for Grateful Dead tickets.  And then it was a whole week of giving away these tickets, you know, being a music jock.  Yeah.  So you kind of like try to have a little fun with it.  So one night, you know, I don't have to check with anybody.  Back in the day, you didn't have to check with lawyers and program directors. 
[00:04:30]  You just did it.  You just did it and hoped for the best.  So I just went on the air and I went on the air and I said, hey, first person that brings  us a foreign, has to be foreign.  Yeah.  And we're going to, we're going to look at the license and everything or the green card  or what have you.  And a foreign 7-Eleven worker gets to go over to the Grateful Dead and we'll throw in a  t-shirt and a bumper sticker and a coffee cup.  And boy, they showed up.  Boy, did they.  And this, this lady showed up blindfolded. 
[00:05:00]  This is, this is as, as real as it gets.  And she had no clue where she was when we, when they took off the blindfold and she was  standing in front of a mic.  And she was like, I don't know where I am.  Why?  But a thick accent.  Right.  She goes, I don't know who these people are or why I'm here.  And she had the uniform on and everything.  Oh, it was great.  Yeah.  The old days.  I don't know if I have audio of that.  I saved a bunch of those shows, but I got to find them.  They're all just buried somewhere in a box. 
[00:05:30]  So then I was thinking, maybe we do that with Britney Spears today.  And then it reminded me, yeah, times have changed.  Yeah.  That might be a jail sentence now.  Could be kidnapping.  Back in the day, it wasn't a jail sentence, but in 2008.  She still have her security guards with her and stuff.  No, she's pretty much on her own.  On her own.  She's hanging with a paparazzo.  What's she doing in New York?  What's she doing breathing at this point?  Yeah.  She doesn't know what she's doing.  Was it in the paper reporting she's in New York? 
[00:06:00]  Nah, TMZ.  Oh, TMZ.  What did they say she was doing here?  TMZ.com.  She jumped on a plane out of Van Nuys or however.  Van Nuys.  Out there in L.A., private jet.  Landed in Teterboro around a couple hours ago with the paparazzo  that she's been hanging out with.  Yeah.  She's hanging out with a paparazzo.  That's how bad her life has gotten.  You know, the guys that are basically hunting her.  Yeah.  She decided to take one of them into her home.  Boy, he must be, like, thrilled. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, my God.  He gets the exclusive.  We all thought she was, you know, unobtainable.  Yeah.  At this point, if you're a guy, if you're a girl, if you're listening to our voices right  now, you have a chance, especially if you live in the New York City area, that Britney  is going to bang you tonight.  Yeah.  It's definitely doable.  It's very doable.  In the old days when she was real hot and relevant in the music scene, there was no way.  You'd look and go, oh, that's impossible. 
[00:07:00]  Right.  She's up on a pedestal.  There's no way to get her now, anyone, any guy with a little bit of game can get her.  They don't know why she's in New York, but she's here with the paparazzo.  Jimmy, say paparazzo.  She's here with the paparazzo.  Paparazzo.  They like to be called paparazzos.  Photographer.  And Dr. Phil has taken a beating in the paper.  Oh, is he?  Good.  Yeah, very good. 
[00:07:30]  You know, everyone saw through that crap that he was going to do a whole like intervention  Britney show on TV.  It's like if you really cared about Britney, you would do it behind the scenes, not on  a TV show.  He basically said, and now he's saying he didn't say this, that he was going to get Britney  and her parents on the show.  Yeah.  Boy, that's really helping.  And then he visits her and makes an assessment of her mental health and then goes on TV and  pretty much just blabs about what he saw. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Things that are completely unethical.  Yeah.  As a psychiatrist or a mental health professional, he just blabs about his assessment of her mental  health.  Yeah.  You're not supposed to do that.  Yeah.  Dr. Phil.  Jackass.  He's a phony.  He certainly is.  He's an absolute phony.  Yeah, but he's unlicensed in California and his license in Texas lapsed.  So he's nothing.  Exactly.  He's been classified.  It says in 2002, they convened a panel to rule if he was acting as a clinical psychologist 
[00:08:30]  in need of a license, it was determined he was doing more entertainment than psychology.  So it's like, I mean, he's not even a real psychologist.  And he looks too much like Jeffrey Tambor.  Hey, no.  He just looks too much like him.  From the Ropers.  Yeah.  Before we continue, I just got to, just a little taste.  Yeah.  A bunch of people are going to know what this is.  And guess what?  A bunch of you just won't, just won't know at this point. 
[00:09:00]  This?  Yeah.  Pretty recent.  I like this.  Just a little taste.  The king shall be received.  Strap in.  Strap in.  Strap in.  Well, I dreamt I saw the knights in armor coming, saying something about a queen. 
[00:09:30]  There were presents singing, and drummers drumming, and the archer split the tree.  There was a fanfare blowing to the sun that was floating on the breeze.  Look at Mother Nature on the run in the 21st century. 
[00:10:00]  That's all you get.  That's all you get for now.  What an ass.  Well, I dreamt I saw the knight in armor coming, saying something about a queen.  I want to play that part ten times today.  Yeah, the very beginning.  The very beginning.  That's when it kicks in.  Yeah.  We're going to get this part stuck in your head for the rest of the day, hopefully for 
[00:10:30]  the whole weekend.  Just isolate the first part, somebody in the office for me.  Well, I dreamt I saw the knights in armor coming, saying something about a queen.  That's all I want right there.  Well, I dreamt I saw the knights in armor calling something about a queen. 
[00:11:00]  You're not going to believe who that is, by the way.  That's good.  If you don't know already.  That's good?  You like that?  Yeah.  That's got a nice, it's got a throaty quality to it.  He put his own style to it, which is good.  Anyone could just sing it the way Neil Young did.  Yeah, sure.  This is very special.  Is this not an original song?  No.  Oh, no.  This is after the gold rush, Jimmy.  Neil Young.  But this isn't Neil Young, of course. 
[00:11:30]  No.  One more time.  Well, I dreamt I saw the knights in armor coming, saying something about a queen.  That's good stuff.  That's good stuff.  It's really amazing how they got the sound of music in there, and they got the shower water  sound out.  No, it's not rotgut. 
[00:12:00]  Linger longer.  I'm bringing back the linger longer instead of the...  I'm just like...  And just kind of screwing off for the first break.  Are you now sniffling?  That's more than a sniffle.  He's blowing a boatload of snot out of his nose.  What do you got going on, Jimmy?  You got a little cold now, too?  No, my whole life has been a long act of torture.  Yeah.  My nose.  Jimmy's got bad sinuses.  Man, wherever you go in New York, people are just sneezing.  Captain Trips.  And blowing their nose. 
[00:12:30]  That's it.  Runny eyes.  That's the super flu.  We're done for.  I was thinking today on the way in how nice it would be.  I would probably cry if I just could breathe good.  Aw.  Yeah.  I'd cry if I could breathe bad.  Very emotional.  Hey, you're just a mess with all of your senses.  You have to have your eyes fixed.  Your nose is screwed up.  You can't put any kind of little earbuds in your ears.  So you're hearing.  Fetus ears.  And just crap comes out of your mouth.  You're a potty mouth. 
[00:13:00]  But you know what?  I have a great sense of smell, believe it or not.  Really?  I really do.  Despite my awful sinuses and the fact that I've smoked for 17 years.  I have a great sense of smell.  By the way, someone is trying to guess who's singing the song.  Uh-huh.  Blue Heeler from Kentucky writes, my name's William, and I like to wear dresses.  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  You think that's who's singing this?  Well, I dreamed I saw a night in armor.  One more time.  This will be stuck in your head. 
[00:13:30]  You'll be humming this at work today.  You'll be in the bathroom looking at yourself in the mirror trying to imitate this.  I dreamed I saw a night in armor coming, saying something about a queen.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  What are you?  What?  I dreamed I saw a night in armor saying something about a big fat person.  What?  Try it at home. 
[00:14:00]  It's fun.  I dreamed I saw a night in armor saying something about a queen.  The queen.  The queen.  I dreamed I saw a night in armor saying something about a queen.  What?  Can't get enough of that.  And just quickly, because I know we're a show that mostly talks to men, but we can't help  ourselves today. 
[00:14:30]  Anyway, there's a picture in the Daily News of Kim Cattrall.  You know, the sex and the city bombshell.  The sex pot.  From Sex and the City.  They call her the sex pot.  This is great.  And they're filming a Sex and the City movie because we just can't get enough of Sex and  the City.  We didn't have enough.  So now you need a movie.  And Anthony is holding up the picture of the sex pot to the pal talkers out there so they  could check out the picture as well. 
[00:15:00]  And for everybody else in America, we'll put the picture up on onaradio.com.  And basically, it's Kim Cattrall.  She's in a granny version of a bikini.  It's the only way to explain it.  It is the worst bikini on one of the worst bodies ever.  She's pretty much wearing Bruno Sammartino's wrestling shorts.  Ivan Putski's wrestling shorts.  Stephen has for a short.  Do something with that later today. 
[00:15:30]  And definitely get some pictures of Bruno Sammartino or one of those old-time wrestlers  like Chief J. Strongbow.  And put it right next to the picture of Kim Cattrall so you can see what she's wearing.  Basically, old-school wrestling shorts that go way above her belly button.  But don't go too far down on the leg.  You know what I'm saying here?  So it's way up on the leg, but then goes way past her belly button.  This is supposed to be some kind of bikini.  And then the top that's holding back those boulders. 
[00:16:00]  She has square breasts.  I've seen pictures of them.  Yeah.  They're square on the bottom.  Like they're not round.  Right.  It's the oddest thing.  And then in the picture, because they know this is the best she can look is by giving her  like kind of a grandma bikini, they know it's not really covering up enough of the hurt. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, dude.  So she's wearing some kind of coat.  I thought it was a sweater, but now that I see the color photograph, it's a coat to try  to cover up the rest of the mess.  And then the Daily News, because they're a bunch of pussies, writes,  Bikini Bombshell.  They're calling her the Bikini Bombshell.  Kim Cattrall in character as Sultry Samantha.  Sultry.  Shoots a Sex and the City scene on the beach in Malibu. 
[00:17:00]  There's nothing bikini or bombshell-y about this picture.  What, are they doing a movie?  Yes.  Why can't anyone be honest about the Sex and the City girls?  They're not sexy.  No.  No, one is kind of cute.  The dark-haired one?  Yeah, she's kind of cute.  She's like, well, you know, walking around with the rest of them.  Right, well.  She looks like hot, but I...  Right.  So, there's Kim Cattrall, your bikini bombshell. 
[00:17:30]  We'll put the picture up on onaradio.com.  We saw this picture in the caption.  We just started openly laughing.  We could not believe that the Daily News is that wussified, that they wouldn't say the  real thing here, that she never was hot to begin with, and she's definitely lost it since  the show went off, what, HBO or whatever it was.  Since Porky's, she lost it.  And I wish my brother would call in with his freaking, you know, Samantha...  Speaking of Porky's...  Impression, right. 
[00:18:00]  I got porked last night.  Did ya?  Did ya?  They'll be sitting down at a table eating little lunch.  Right.  All the girls together.  And they'll be talking about something innocent.  And then Samantha's gotta sex it up by talking about how it ties into how she was just savaged  the night before.  Just ravaged and savaged the night before.  By some Obama voter. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Speaking of bombshell, I took a big boy.  I took little man and fat boy last night.  My face looked like Nagasaki.  Oh, it's just awful.  Yeah.  I played Pearl Harbor.  I made believe I was a battleship. 
[00:19:00]  That old one.  No, what is that old gag?  She couldn't be the battleship.  Yeah.  I made believe my man was the battleship.  And I came by and blew the hell out of him.  Right, right, right.  So.  Oh, wow.  That's...  I thought...  Yeah.  With the semen.  Oh, it could be that, too.  Yeah, the killers.  Yeah, so.  There you go.  That's how we start today.  Oh, oh, wait.  One more of these, though. 
[00:19:30]  Nice.  How come you like to play one verse, though?  I'd love to hear, like, a little more.  A little later in the show.  I love that.  I dreamt they saw the knights in armor coming, saying something about a queen.  Come on.  You know you want to do it at home.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  That is just an abomination. 
[00:20:00]  It sure is.  It sure is.  And there is another song, too.  You want me to give you a piece of the other song?  Yeah.  All right.  Just a piece.  Good God, you're everything.  Take one.  Good God, you're everything.  I see.  You got the touch.  Right.  Exactly.  You got the power. 
[00:20:30]  That's great.  Good God, you're everything.  Yeah.  Good God, you're everything.  Take one.  Good God, you're everything I see.  Good God, you're everything to me.  Who saw that coming?  Oh.  You got the touch.  That's a sick voice. 
[00:21:00]  You got the power.  The magic's on those tapes, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got the touch.  All psych.  All is said and done.  You never want.  You never run.  You're a winner.  This was so good.  You know the streets. 
[00:21:30]  Break the rules.  Take the heat.  You're nobody's fool.  You're at your best when the corn gets riled.  You've been put to the deck, but it's never enough.  This is going to get him out of porno, man.  You got the touch.  You got the touch.  Make him a star.  That is so good.  It's so perfectly awful.  Sorry, sorry.  Yes.  The song was featured in the Transformers movie.  Good God, you're everything I've seen. 
[00:22:00]  Same type of sound.  Good God, you're everything to me.  Good God, shut up.  That's all you get right now.  I'm sorry, but that's all you get.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We're off to a fine start today.  Fine start.  Britney in New York City.  Kim Cattrall looking like a mess at the paper today.  What else are we going to make fun of today?  Huh?  What else?  Oh, the meter maid.  Oh, Jimmy.  We got a story for you.  I think the ticket. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, we got a story for you.  Those useless things that walk around handing out tickets.  We'll get into it next.  We'll get into it next.  And what else?  What else?  The Golf Channel thing's got a bit of legs.  We'll talk about that next.  It's because Reverend Al's getting involved.  Stupid Reverend Al's getting involved.  He's outraged.  He's got to get involved with everything.  Of course he does.  And then what else?  What else?  What else?  We got all the Hillary thing we asked for.  The different voices of Hillary.  Oh, good. 
[00:23:00]  We're going to be doing that today.  Is it a montage?  Montage.  There he is.  Shut up.  Sorry.  And all the stuff that's coming to the table as we speak.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Stay there.  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  I want to start this break by reading something.  Ooh.  I'm a good reader.  Reading.  Reading's stupid.  Not a great reader, but a good reader. 
[00:23:30]  I read from the New York Post.  From their January 24th, 2007 paper.  Almost a year ago.  Donald Trump will never be a guest on Opie and Anthony again.  Wow.  A year ago.  The XM satellite radio duo begged him to come on recently to discuss his feud with Rosie 
[00:24:00]  O'Donnell.  Trump agreed.  But after his interview, the shock jock sent out a press release claiming Trump had called  into the show, implying he was hungry for publicity.  Hmm.  Everybody in the world was trying to get me on their show.  I turned down Larry King, Trump told page six.  Yeah.  The idea that I call these two slobs is laughable.  Uh-huh.  Maybe someone said that you call them slobs, and he said, the idea that I call these two 
[00:24:30]  slobs is laughable.  Because why would anyone call you slobs?  It's a good thing.  Hmm.  I read that today because at 730, Donald Trump will be calling the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  And it says he'll never be a guest on the Opie and Anthony show again.  But did anyone-  According to this article in the Post from almost a year ago.  I don't think anyone implied that he was hungry for publicity when he called in the show.  No, some ass trying to get us in trouble with Donald Trump.  Because Donald Trump called our show because he was promoting something, and it just so happened 
[00:25:00]  to be around the time that he was going after Rosie.  So we asked him about the Rosie stuff.  By the way, he did call us.  We didn't call him.  He was scheduled to call our show.  We just had perfect timing on the whole thing.  We never sent out a press release whatsoever.  We kind of bragged a little that we had Donald Trump on in the middle of this crazy Rosie stuff.  The big controversy with Rosie, yeah.  That was a big coup for the radio show, and that's all we did.  But someone took that and gave this to page six in the New York Post. 
[00:25:30]  And page six from the New York Post, they hate our guts.  So any chance they could give us a little-  They're going to do it.  They're going to do it.  So, but it should be interesting because Donald Trump will be calling in less than an hour.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't he find out what happened, though?  Because it's almost like someone from the Post probably said to him,  ah, they said you're calling the show just to get on the-  But no one said that.  Right.  Well, you should have probably checked that first.  Well, that's how things work in this world, though. 
[00:26:00]  No one checks anything.  No.  Not in showbiz.  No.  And he is in showbiz.  I mean, that's what he does.  He builds some stuff, so I hear.  Well, I'll say this.  I would rather have him in charge of the tavern on the green, all these things.  When he takes something over, it just gets fixed.  Yeah.  I like that.  Yep.  Throws money at it, and it gets fixed.  Why are you kissing his ass?  Already.  We're in the middle of a war with him.  Are we?  It's going to get ugly.  Slobs.  Yeah, let him try to get tavern on the green.  I don't know.  That's my big comeback. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  I won't eat there, ever, like I never have before.  All right.  Let's calm everybody down.  Oh.  Well, I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming.  Sing something about a queen.  I like that part.  Sing something.  He has to fit singing.  Night in armor calling.  Say something about. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah.  By the way, some people will care about this, and others will be like, yeah, whatever.  But yesterday, I told everybody that the Opie and Anthony show in the latest ratings was  number two, men 18 of 49.  Now, why is that important, Anthony?  Why is that important?  Because that is our demo.  Oh, that is who we are supposed to be entertaining.  We would like to do very well in all the demos.  Trust me.  That is our long-term goal.  But let's see. 
[00:27:30]  Tween girls.  Right.  We're not going to do well with the tween girls.  But we're pretty much hired killers to just destroy in the men 18 of 49 demo.  That is a fact.  That's what it's all about.  When they sit us down behind closed doors, that's all they talk about.  We need you to do a radio show where you're going to be number one, men 18 of 49.  Well, yesterday, the ratings came out, or two days ago, and we were number two, men 18 of  49.  Yeah.  Oh, but there's an update. 
[00:28:00]  Yes.  You see, we're number two, men 18 of 49, between 6 and 10 a.m.  Yes, but wait a minute, Opie.  We leave these very airwaves on FM radio at 9.  That's right.  Eastern time.  That's right.  So the big bosses, what they do is they go behind closed doors.  They look at the ratings a little closer.  They take the 9 o'clock hour out because we have nothing to do with it, and then they  retaliate.  I was trying to think of the tabulate word that you came up with the other day in lieu 
[00:28:30]  of tabulate, and it's tallyate.  Yeah.  But when you say retaliate, now it's a completely new word.  Yes.  But you know what?  I'm starting to think, you know, for many years, people would make fun of the fact that  I would just mispronounce stuff.  But I think it's time to embrace some of these words that come up with.  And just use them.  Because you know in a weird way they make sense.  You know that tallyate makes sense.  Because you're tallying something up.  Sure.  So they retaliated in the back offices. 
[00:29:00]  And the Opie and Anthony show between 6 and 9 a.m., that's when we broadcast, is officially  number one with men 18 to 49.  Yes.  That's exactly what we were hired to do.  Yes.  So we are doing that.  Numero uno.  What about the 9 to 10 hour?  It's a disaster, to be quite honest with you.  Oh, jeez.  It's a work in progress.  Disaster.  Work in progress.  And Tom, don't get mad at me.  Jim asked.  I was just answering.  But I want to... 
[00:29:30]  Because I was thinking that I might do something for 9 to 10.  Oh.  That would help.  That would be huge.  That would be nice.  You should, actually.  Just a funny little thing.  What would it be?  Just go, ah.  I'd play songs and stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See, here's one.  I'd play stuff that K-Rock totally hates.  Just like old school rap.  Sugar Hill Gang.  Sugar Hill Gang.  Or Diana Ross, who I'm going to see on Sunday night at the Borgata.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  Why would you?  Why wouldn't you? 
[00:30:00]  What?  My comeback.  No, you're not.  I'm leaving from Pennsylvania.  I'm doing a gig in PA.  And I'm doing the Borgata next week.  But I'm going this week, Sunday night, to see Diana Ross.  Well, have fun with that, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Is it for the girl?  No, I suggested.  I'm like, do you want to go?  No, you didn't.  I did.  How do you not like Diana Ross?  Well.  She belts a tune out.  You can, but if you go, are you going to be excited to hear this? 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  Because Diana Ross, we were watching her on YouTube.  When she sings, she smiles.  She has really weird teeth.  Like, I guess that's old school.  Like, from the 60s.  Uh-huh.  She was totally detached from what she was saying.  She would just smile through every sad song.  I just can't see.  I just can't see you sitting there listening to that.  I'll clap to baby love.  No, you won't.  I will.  I love Diana Ross.  She rules.  How do you not like her?  You will be surrounded by a gentleman that love Diana Ross. 
[00:31:00]  And let me tell you something.  Perhaps their sexual orientation may be a bit different than yours.  Jeff Gordon, the promoter who's like leaving me tickets, who does my stuff too, says, okay,  I'll put you on the list right between and name somebody else and his hairdresser.  He's basically saying you're a fruit.  Have fun.  Of course.  Diana Ross is very big in the gay community.  But you make it sound. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  But Anthony makes it sound like if Jim Norton goes to this, you know, concert and sees  Diana Ross that he's going to be used as a pin cushion in the middle of the concert.  Could be.  He's going to be what they call the cracker in the middle.  Oh, yeah.  Or the lucky devil.  However you want to look at it.  I like that.  We watched her on YouTube.  I like her a lot.  I mean, I'm going to enjoy this.  She's great live, I'm sure.  You'll tap your fingers to a song or two.  That's about it.  But please tell me that you didn't download the crap.  I watched her on YouTube. 
[00:32:00]  Old Ed Sullivan's.  You know what?  When were you doing that?  Because I was watching some old shows like Merv and stuff, clips from that.  I saw, you know who had a great voice?  Just amazing.  That fat mama Cass Elliot.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus Christ.  They have some YouTube clips of her.  She had a great appetite.  Doing Dream a Little Dream.  Dream a Little Dream of me.  Yeah.  And there was nothing little about her.  No. 
[00:32:30]  I'm going to keep going.  But her voice.  Except the hold of the food went down.  Throat would be the word.  Stupid throat.  Not the hold of the food went down.  The hold of the food went down.  That was a little boy panicking to get a line out.  The hold of the food goes.  It worked.  Yeah.  We all knew.  I don't know what.  You know this song?  No.  Just hold me tight.  You know it.  You know the hook.  You'll miss me.  Mm-hmm.  While I'm alone and blue as can be. 
[00:33:00]  Dream a Little Dream of me.  If you didn't know any better, if you didn't know any better, you would think this girl  was really, really hot.  Listen to her sing a little higher.  Still craving your kiss.  You still on this one?  I'm longing to finger till the end.  Mm-hmm.  Nope.  Just saying this.  She's in the Mamas and the Papas. 
[00:33:30]  Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you.  Yeah.  You know, I know who she was.  I didn't know her voice.  Yeah.  Big fat woman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very big fat person.  She's got diamonds cutting her back as she sings.  In your dreams, whatever they be.  Dream a Little Dream of me.  Ah!  All these great singers are just getting zapped and spanked.  That was a good spanking.  All right, listen.  We got lots to do. 
[00:34:00]  We got the Meter Maid story or we got the Golf Channel story.  I'll go either way right now.  We got the Golf Channel one because we talked about that and I have not heard the audio.  Well, what do we know about this?  Kelly Tillman was racially insensitive on the Golf Channel.  Talking about golf and Tiger Woods, right?  Travis, what do we know?  I know we got the story in front of us, but what do we got on this?  Yeah, they were talking about young golfers trying to catch up to Tiger Woods.  And one of the anchors said they should just gang up on him. 
[00:34:30]  And Kelly Tillman just jokingly said, yeah, like, lynch him in a back alley.  Huh.  And that was it.  But I don't understand, like, how stupid are you as a reporter or as a commentator for a golf?  Right.  How is that going to fly?  Yeah.  Yeah, that, especially in this day and age, you know.  I mean, you know, you're going to work it out with a script.  Yeah, but.  I don't know not to say lynch the black golfer.  Yeah, that's kind of. 
[00:35:00]  And then there was definitely some uncomfortable, you know, laughing.  I'll definitely say that that's probably, in this environment, she probably should have known better.  And she got in trouble.  Well.  I'd gather.  But to have, you know, Reverend Al step in now is just, again, shut up.  Where was Al?  Did Al contact that cop's family in Brooklyn?  Remember when the guys were eating KFC or whatever?  They blasted the two cops in the face and one died. 
[00:35:30]  I don't think so.  I don't think so, no.  Probably not.  That's not important enough for him.  He goes for the stuff that gives him a lot of publicity.  Right.  Anthony taught me that.  He helps the convict surrender in Mexico.  Helps him surrender.  And now he's mad that the lady made the joke.  Well, here's.  I think this is the actual comment right here.  It was an on-air conversation about Tiger Woods' dominance in golf until Kelly Tillman went there. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, maybe they should just gang out for a while until.  Lynch him in the back alley.  Yeah, that's right.  Lynch him in a back alley?  And then days later when she tried to apologize, she couldn't quite get that right either.  Nick, the other day we were joking around about ways to spur on these young players.  I made a brief comment that certainly wasn't meant to offend anyone involved.  And that was it.  She went on with her analysis of the tournament.  Well, what was she supposed to do?  Yeah.  Spend 20 minutes on it?  Yeah.  Acknowledged it, said it was wrong, and that's that. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  So they suspended her for two weeks.  Two weeks suspension?  But she's not fired.  Two weeks vacation?  No.  Reverend Al wants her fired.  But Tiger Woods, he said he's not.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  When you just casually say she's not fired, that's ridiculous.  Yet.  Usually the susp...  Thank you, yeah.  Usually these suspensions lead to a firing because they have to figure out who else they're  going to take down with her.  That's what suspensions are all about.  That's when they're doing their internal investigation, which means just getting their ducks in order  so they can fire you. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  Did someone tell you to say this?  Did he encourage you?  What do you know about this?  Don't worry.  Who laughed?  Don't worry.  We'll get you back on the air soon.  But we just need to know a little more about the situation here.  We'll get you back on the air.  Are you?  We'll see.  She tried to apologize again before the suspension.  She tried to apologize on paper.  I used some poorly chosen words, she said.  I have known Tiger Woods for 12 years and have apologized directly to him.  I also apologize to our viewers who may have been offended. 
[00:37:30]  Not good enough, says Al Sharpton.  In a statement released tonight, Sharpton threatened to picket the Golf Channel offices.  The apology was not enough, he said.  The comment was not just racially insensitive, but an affront to the entire black community.  He's got to just shut the hell up.  Where is he picketing?  In front of the Golf Channel.  Oh, someone should just come out with a bag and hand it to him and go, okay, come on.  Oh, would that be funny? 
[00:38:00]  Stupid Al.  Who's your caddy?  Who's your caddy?  You know what?  I don't blame Al.  Every time he barks, white people panic and grab their ankles.  Go ahead, Al.  Yeah.  For however long you want.  Yeah, if you had that power base and it worked every time, wouldn't you use it?  Sure.  Of course I would.  Well, Jason's going to answer the story from Boston.  Jason, go ahead.  Hi.  You know, she's known Tiger for like 10 years.  She's friends with him and she apologized to him face to face already. 
[00:38:30]  And Tiger's totally cool with it.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Maybe Kelly felt like, okay, I know Tiger pretty well.  Just a stupid worded joke that wasn't, especially since someone else said they ought to gang up on him.  She didn't, right?  No, yeah.  She just kind of tagged it with a dumb line.  Yeah.  All right, it happens.  It's like she dropped an N-bomb and then like elbowed somebody.  It happens.  One more bit of audio here.  As for Tiger Woods, he made it clear tonight to a spokesman that he was not offended by the remarks. 
[00:39:00]  The story is a non-issue.  The statement released tonight says Tiger has a great deal of respect for Kelly.  We know unequivocally that there was no ill intent, a sentiment not shared by Reverend Sharpton, who still plans protests unless Tillman is fired.  Okay, listen to me.  Why is he?  If the guy that the line was about was not offended,  it said it's a non-issue, then Reverend Al has to just walk away.  Just leave it alone, then.  Walk away.  What is he, protector of people that don't want to be protected? 
[00:39:30]  There's nothing else going on right now.  I'm a superhero for people that don't need it.  Go away.  You're too stupid to know you need Reverend Al.  I am a superhero.  I know better.  This is a non-issue.  I really don't want to.  Shut up.  The cameras are rolling.  I will be there to help you.  You just don't realize you need the help.  This is an affront to all people of color.  Purple and green people, too.  Oh, I think Tiger Woods is a good judge of character. 
[00:40:00]  And if he's saying that he wasn't offended and it's a non-issue, then you know what?  You just can move on to the next dumb thing.  Move on to the next dumb thing.  Yeah, there's plenty of things for him to hop on board.  If the people don't care, Reverend Al shouldn't care.  Yeah.  Individuals.  Why can't people just be individuals?  See, he's pretty much defending all people of color. 
[00:40:30]  When it's an individual, if they were offended, that's one thing.  They're not.  Leave it alone.  But he's not defending all people of color.  Where was he in Newark?  Yeah.  When those three black students were assassinated or shot to death by those Latin gang members.  Where was he?  Where was his anger?  When those black kids were just shot to death.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a phony.  He's a pig.  He's a pig. 
[00:41:00]  So phony.  And the fact that anybody ever listens to him and takes him seriously is just laughable.  Yeah.  The guy's a pig.  Yeah.  So Reverend Al comes up to me and he goes, Oonga, Oonga, Oonga, Oonga, Oonga, Oonga.  Oonga.  And on your deathbed, you shall receive total consciousness.  So I got that going for me, which is nice.  Reverend Al? 
[00:41:30]  I'm not a reverend.  I'm not a reverend.  Not a reverend.  I'm a man like you.  My name's Al.  You're a reverend.  No, my name's Al.  There is no black people.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Ah, reverend Al makes it interesting for everybody.  What an idiot.  In his expensive suits that no one knows how they get paid for. 
[00:42:00]  Ah.  He's constantly under investigation.  Constantly.  Him and his cohorts are under investigation.  I was selling the first HBO DVD.  Remember we did the towel record sign and you guys came and there was a gentleman who took  a photo with us.  Big fan, dude.  And apparently he was the guy who stabbed Sharpton in Brooklyn or whatever.  That stabbed him.  Yeah.  Years ago, Reverend Al got stabbed.  I was saved by my Volkswagen hubcap medallion that I used to wear. 
[00:42:30]  That guy's at all of our events and we pretty much tell him every time, just keep that to  yourself.  Yeah, keep it to yourself.  That bit of info.  We're happy you like the Opie and Anthony show, but.  That guy is so proud of stabbing Reverend Al.  He is so proud of it.  Is it wrong that every time I see that guy, I just want to go, bad aim.  How is he not in prison, though?  Yeah, he explained it to us.  He did his time.  Did he?  And now he's a fan of the show.  How much time do you do for that? 
[00:43:00]  Jesus.  We might have to get him on the show to talk about it.  The guy got out pretty quickly.  Yeah.  How much time did he do?  It's attempted murder.  He did, I think, 12 hours.  I mean, he was.  Perhaps more than that, Opie.  He was trying to kill the man.  It was attempted murder.  It had to be.  Was he?  Or was he just trying to injure him?  Where did he stab him, though?  Right in the chest.  He stabbed him in the chest.  Makes me giggle.  Unbelievable.  All right, we got a break.  When we come back, we got to do Dumb, Dumber, and Dead. 
[00:43:30]  Ooh.  What's that?  And the meter maid.  Ugh.  Wait till you hear this story.  Tired of those things.  And we got Tippy Tom doing some books on tape.  And we got the bleep game from yesterday, which was very, very fun.  Oh, that's the other thing we needed.  Yeah, we'll do that after the break as well.  The bleep game that those guys put together.  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Lots to do today.  Stay there.  All right!  We got a busy morning. 
[00:44:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Bob Kelly joining the program.  He's playing Carolines.  Oh, this weekend.  Very cool.  212-757-4100.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday night at Carolines.  Get your tickets now.  Bob Kelly blowing up physically and career-wise.  And he's going to have some full houses there.  So if you want to see Bob, make sure you get your tickets in advance.  Also, Donald Trump calling the show in about a half hour.  Last time we spoke to him, he basically told the New York Post he would never be on our show again. 
[00:44:30]  Well, guess what?  He's calling today within the half hour.  And Jim Norton, very, very annoyed.  I hate doormen.  I mean, I know you guys got to do your jobs and protect clubs.  But the majority of you are just want-to-be cops.  And you don't know how to handle the power you have.  You're not competent.  These aren't building doormen.  These are like club doormen.  Nightclub jerks.  You know, they look at you, see how you're dressed.  Nightclub bouncer doormen things.  They check out your chick to see if she's hot enough. 
[00:45:00]  They check out your resume to see what you've done in the entertainment business.  And then they decide if you're allowed to go into their club.  Their fancy establishment.  They actually have a guy at the Hyde in L.A. next to Laugh Factory.  Somebody with IMDB.  And they check your name and your movie credits.  Are you kidding me?  At the door.  And if they're not good enough?  You're out.  Oh, wow.  My jaw moved when I read this.  This is the post today.  The Wire star Michael K. Williams missed his own premiere party Friday night when the stubborn 
[00:45:30]  door Nazi refused to let him in with his entire posse.  He plays Omar Little on The Wire, who's the gay thug.  He's basically the star of The Wire.  He's got a small part.  No.  And he showed up with like eight guys.  I think he's gay in real life.  I've heard he is.  I don't know if he's not.  But yeah, he showed up with eight men.  He's sexy.  Very popular.  And the doorman wouldn't let the ball in.  He's like, we all have to get in.  But he's the most interesting guy on The Wire.  How do you tell the guy, who's basically the star of the show, you can't bring people 
[00:46:00]  in?  I don't.  It's a power thing.  Of course not.  They love it.  Nope.  Only two.  Only two.  Oh, do they love it?  Well.  God almighty.  You ever had to deal with those people?  I hate their guts.  We avoid that crap.  I've never, yeah.  I've never gone to one of those places where.  Unless we get the big invite, then there's no reason to go to those places.  I go to dumps and dives that you can just walk right into. 
[00:46:30]  Get a beer quick.  Yeah.  They're just little men at heart.  They're big guys who can probably knock your teeth out.  Yeah.  They're wannabe cops, and they don't know how to handle the little bit of power.  Yeah.  You're guarding a place where people are doing ecstasy and playing music.  It's not the White House steps, you idiot.  Hey, let's talk about poor Eugene.  Meter Maid writes him a cruel ticket.  We talk about these meter maids.  And I'm so glad the paper is calling them.  Calling them a meter maid. 
[00:47:00]  Meter maids, yeah.  Because they hate being called meter maids.  Let me explain what it is.  They're traffic enforcement officers.  Yeah, let me explain what happened here in New York City.  Maybe it's happening in other cities.  We love the NYPD.  We support them no matter what happens to them for the most part.  We drink with them.  We party with them.  They come to a lot of our gigs.  We're all about supporting the NYPD.  We go to the civilian review board about them.  And we support the firemen, which is a weird position for us to be in. 
[00:47:30]  Because basically the firemen and the police hate each other.  But we like both groups.  What can I tell you?  But what they did here in New York, because a lot of these meter maids were getting punched in the face,  they kind of made them part of the NYPD.  They wear the uniform.  They used to be called brownies, because they would wear this brown uniform.  And they'd walk around and give tickets out to people.  And yeah, they were just getting their asses handed to them.  Sometimes they'd be writing a ticket.  Somebody would come out, get mad, see their stupid brown uniform, and just punch them in the face. 
[00:48:00]  And in most cases, they deserved to be punched in the face.  So what happened was they got together and said,  Look, we can't be punched in the face.  So they kind of dress them up like cops almost.  Yeah, but they don't have any power.  No, they have a little walkie-talkie on their hip instead of a gun.  They get the silly car, the silly little...  The little dark blue car here in New York.  Yeah, the skinny little cart.  It says traffic enforcement on it. 
[00:48:30]  And you can blast past them at 90 and laugh at them, because they can't do anything about it.  They can't pull you over.  It's the best thing.  They're basically scums.  And they're all about writing tickets.  They're all about writing illegal tickets.  Tickets that you can't prove.  Huge amounts of tickets.  You have to go downtown and fight it and all this crap.  I told a story.  I was in a brownstone living and came back from a weekend.  And I know these bastards are always around like rats. 
[00:49:00]  And so I pull up to my brownstone.  There's no way to park.  It's impossible.  So I unloaded all my stuff on the weekend.  There was no way I could find a parking spot and then load all the stuff we had for a weekend trip we had.  So it was like, okay, quick.  Get the stuff out.  Even acknowledging no one they're around somewhere.  And get back in my car and park it, right?  Yep.  The time it took for me to take two bags, literally run into my apartment, I was on the ground floor, and back out.  I'm telling you, it was less than a minute. 
[00:49:30]  By the time I got back, I had a ticket on my car.  That's the type of people they are.  Especially because they know that you were double parked to unload your car.  And you're not holding up traffic, by the way.  Plenty of room for anyone that's going down that particular street to get by you.  But this is what they do.  They hang out by the meter as soon as it clicks, you know, a violation there of writing, man.  And you see mothers running with little kids in strollers and stuff like, oh, can you give me a break?  You know, I had a doctor's...  They don't give a crap, right?  Well, they got caught with a doozy, and it made the paper. 
[00:50:00]  Meter made rights, writes them a cool ticket.  Eugene, how do you say that last name there, Jimmy?  Old.  All right, old.  84 got a ticket when he helped his wife marry from their car outside a dialysis center in Brooklyn.  When 84-year-old Eugene Old double parked in front of a dialysis clinic so he could escort his blind, frail wife to the car...  Blind and frail.  ...getting dialysis, he expected a little understanding.  Instead, he got a ticket for $115. 
[00:50:30]  The Brooklyn traffic agent who spotted the elderly couple couldn't summon up a shred of compassion for their plight.  Now the retired postman is fighting to get the ticket dismissed and wondering how anyone could be so heartless.  My wife is legally blind, can't walk, and is totally disabled, Eugene told the Daily News.  For this meter made a stand there and write me a ticket as I help her into the car, I call that cruel.  Paul, we're a gross society, just gross.  Eugene has a handicapped parking placard for his 92 Chevy, but when he got to the Diker... 
[00:51:00]  Diker...  ...heights dialysis center, there were no open spots on 86th Street.  Okay, what was I supposed to do, he asked yesterday.  There were no empty spaces, and if she doesn't get this treatment, she could die.  Plus, with the description of the wife, he should have just pulled the passenger side next to one of the docks here...  ...and opened the door, let his blind wife just kind of, you know...  Yeah, get out, here's the dialysis center, I'll be parking the car, I'll see you inside. 
[00:51:30]  Here you go, honey, just get out right here.  All right.  Now, just drive away.  Hello, insurance settlement.  That is the song he sang as he drove away.  The insurance settlement song, apparently.  Hello, insurance settlement.  And then he'd go, bop, bop, bop, on the horn.  He was going to be double parked for a few minutes.  The timing would take him to go inside and help his 83-year-old wife, Mary, a few feet across the sidewalk. 
[00:52:00]  He was opening the car door when the traffic enforcement agent pulled up and began writing the ticket,  continuing even after Eugene explained the circumstances.  He was hoping for some sympathy, but all he got was bureaucratic indifference.  I asked her how she could be so thoughtless, and she just smiled and told me there's no double parking.  His wife, who undergoes the life-saving but grueling dialysis treatments for her failing kidneys three times a week, was just appalled.  I'm angry.  How could anyone be so heartless? 
[00:52:30]  This is a lot of money, and all we are asking for is a little consideration.  NYPD officials said when the agent began writing the ticket, she did not see Eugene or his wife,  and once a summons is written, it can't be torn up by the agent.  The agent is the guy.  The agent is the guy.  Hey, can we try to get this person on the phone?  Let's pay.  I'm sure someone else will do it, but let's pay the ticket for them.  Yeah, we have no problem paying that.  Can we try to get them on the telephone?  Can we get poor Eugene on the phone?  He's an older gentleman.  Eugene. 
[00:53:00]  How old is he, 84?  84 years.  Poor bastard.  I've seen these.  I hate most of these guys and women, mostly fat women, by the way.  All fat women.  I've never seen a woman as a parking agent that I would have sex with.  Right, and they're on a power trip the entire time.  They get to play dress-up.  They get to play dress-up cop, and they walk around writing these tickets,  and in a lot of cases, they're writing just illegal tickets.  I mean, they've done a lot of stories here in New York about a lot of, 
[00:53:30]  a lot of these, not a lot, but a bunch of these people that just flat-out write tickets  knowing they can get away with it.  I saw something on, I think it was on YouTube, where somebody just went around  and videotaped them parking illegally.  Right.  And then just ran up to them and said, why are you parked illegally?  You're parking in this, and they weren't doing anything business-oriented.  They weren't writing tickets or directing traffic.  They were going in to get cups of coffee and things like that.  And the guy confronted them, and they were just like, get out of here. 
[00:54:00]  What's your name?  What's your badge number?  And they cover up their badge number.  Yeah.  They run to their car.  Oh, yeah.  Did he get the license number?  The guy was, oh, yeah, yeah, the whole thing.  He was completely calling them out.  We here in New York had a great picture of one of these meter maids, and it was a guy.  You're still a meter maid, even if you're a guy.  And we had that blackout a few summers ago where the city went dark,  and there's a picture that someone captured of one of these meter maids,  a guy, writing a parking ticket. 
[00:54:30]  He's got his book out, his pen, and he's writing.  And in the background of this picture is a traffic light that obviously is not working  because the lights went out in Manhattan, and there was a civilian working the traffic  at that intersection as this effing meter maid is writing a ticket.  Isn't it illegal you couldn't pay somebody's meter?  Like, if somebody's meter, you can't go up and put a quarter in because you can get a ticket. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah, they figured that out.  Like, oh, what happens if people walk up when a parking meter is ready to expire,  and they don't own the car, but they put a quarter in and turn the thing?  Oh, well, we've got to figure out how to make that illegal.  I forgot what city it was, but there was a guy who, you know, everyone's trying to find their thing.  That's what he did.  I believe this guy put on a tutu, if I'm not mistaken.  That was in Jackass.  Was it in Jackass?  It was Jackass.  He was the meter fairy.  Oh, thank you.  Okay, thank you. 
[00:55:30]  The meter fairy.  The meter fairy would run around and pay those meters.  You've got to give Jackass the credit.  Okay, yeah.  And he was feeding the meters.  That was hilarious.  And she came up.  Yeah, she was like, you can't do that.  That's against the law.  Yeah.  Is it really, though?  Like, is it really?  What's the law?  Yeah.  I think it is.  It is.  It is.  It is.  You can get executed.  I believe you can get a ticket.  Hey, let's say hi to Lydia Oceanside.  Lydia, what's up?  Hi, guys.  I used to work for the NYPD as a psychologist, and besides doing the screenings, the psychologicals 
[00:56:00]  for the cops and 911, we did the meter maids, too.  And a lot of times what they did was these were homeless people in shelters, and when the  jobs became available, the social workers made, like, 20 of them come down, take the task,  and then take the psychological, you know?  Wow.  Yeah.  What are they like?  Are they basically wannabe cops?  Like, they're just desperate but incompetent people on a certain level? 
[00:56:30]  Some were exactly like that, and some were the lowest of the low, like, didn't know how  many days were in a week or who the president was or...  They're basically looking for robots with no human emotion, because they're going to  have a lot of people coming up to them and confronting them and saying, look, you know,  can you give me a break?  So that's the type of person they are looking for, some just scum of society.  Scum.  They don't seem like the most educated people. 
[00:57:00]  Like, you can't really carry on a conversation with them.  They don't want people that you can stand there and carry on an intelligent conversation  with, because then you might actually get a valid point across, and they'll go, oh,  you know something?  You're right.  No, they want people that just go, no, no, I already started writing.  What does that mean?  Yeah, what does that mean?  What does that even mean?  You wrote it and you can't do it?  You can't rip it up?  It's a piece of paper.  Shut up.  Yeah, you know. 
[00:57:30]  Now they scan your Reggie or something.  They made it easier for them.  So these guys can run away before they get hit, because it wasn't good enough to put  them in the cop uniform and make them look like they're somebody.  Now they just got to scan your Reggie in your window and the barcode, and then they take  a receipt that pops out of a machine and shove it in your windshield, and they can walk  away.  They don't have to write anything anymore.  It's ridiculous.  Let's go to Garrett in Island Park.  Garrett.  Hey, good morning, guys.  You know, I'm a retired cop, and that story is just brutal, because, you know, these guys 
[00:58:00]  are wearing our uniforms, well, not these guys, these cretins are wearing our uniforms  now, and it gives us a bad name.  It gives the police officers a bad name, because the general public just feel like these people  are probably cops, and, you know, not everybody hates cops because of stories like this.  And it sucks, you know?  I wish they would go back to the brownie uniforms.  Can you imagine a real cop saying no to that?  A real cop actually not just letting those old people go?  Forget about it.  I've never heard of.  Never heard of.  I would never give a working man a summons, because, you know what? 
[00:58:30]  They're just trying to get away with life, and it's just brutal.  It really is.  All right, Garrett.  I've got to cut you off, because we've got Eugene on the phone.  Oh.  Eugene.  Yes, sir.  How are you, sir?  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  We read about you in the paper today.  Yes.  That's tragic.  Yeah, but it's pitiful.  It is.  Those meeting maids over there are so horrible.  What happened, sir?  You were helping your wife in the car, and...  Yeah, well, over there, there's always an emulet congregation there. 
[00:59:00]  You know, at one time when we started there, there was hardly one.  Now there's a caesarei, there's car service, there's emulets of all types, and there's no place to park.  Yeah.  You know, I have this handicap label there, and I got away with it.  I'm going to give this guy a freaking ticket.  I know.  You know, and that day, that day, I usually when I go pick my wife, I have to wait. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, wait, she'll be running 10 minutes, 5 minutes, a half hour, you know.  Uh-huh.  She was ready for me.  I walked in, weighed her.  And on the way back, I have to wait her, because you wait before you go in, way before you go out, because they drain her fluids.  Oh.  And I was there 5 minutes.  I walked out, and there she was giving me a ticket.  And I said, miss, how cool could you be? 
[01:00:00]  You were being cordial, I'm sure.  And...  I said, how can you see the handicapper in there?  She said, well, why didn't you park in the Ambulette Park?  I said, because it was taken.  I said, by the time I came out, they were gone.  You know.  So what's happened?  She has to be walked in, and I take her out on a wheelchair.  Oh, this guy's a saint, and he's getting problems from these meter maids. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, what would you do to this meter maid if you could, sir?  Unbelievable.  Oh, what would I do, sir?  I imagine they have a certain amount that they've got to give.  And it was raining, and...  Oh, my God.  It's raining, too?  His sick wife, he's 84.  How old is your wife, sir?  Dialysis, wheelchairs.  Wait a minute, I've got two voices talking to me.  Oh, sorry, we're awful at that.  You're 84 years old, how old is your wife?  I'm 83, she's 84.  Wow.  Wow, you've been together many years, sir? 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, we have 11 grandchildren, nobody to help me.  God bless, God bless you.  It's a drain on me, I go to the VA a lot.  Yeah.  Because I'm very involved with them health-wise.  Were you in the big one, sir?  In the big what?  The war.  The big war.  Yes, I was, yes.  You were?  Battle of the, you know, I was right up front.  Oh, my goodness.  What, you saw action?  The 3rd Division got discharged from the war ended. 
[01:01:30]  Gee, look at this guy now.  World War II, he served his country, and he can't even take his ill wife to her treatment  without getting a ticket from these meter maids.  No, but if I may ask, tell you, you know, a couple of times I took her on 86th Street, you know, up in the shopping district.  She likes to go to the hamburger place there. 
[01:02:00]  And, you know, you have to double park under the L there.  And I asked a couple of officers, you know, I said, you know, can I take my wife in or take her out?  He says, I said, would you give me a ticket?  He said, no, no, usually we don't.  He said, but that doesn't mean that nobody will.  Yeah, yeah.  I've been lucky like that.  I've been going over here for a couple of years now.  Two years.  Never was bought.  The week before I got the ticket, a gentleman came, I guess he was a mail meter maid, and he walked around the car and left. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  You know, but this one was not even friendly, not even nice.  No.  You know, she said, why don't you park over there?  I said, because it was taken.  The ambulance, there's one ambulance parking place there, that's all.  And the ambulance, they need two spaces because they got left a ramp down.  And behind the ambulance space, there's a meter.  Yeah.  You know, a meter to park. 
[01:03:00]  And it's dangerous.  You've got cars, buses, trailers, wishing down there to make that 14th day of your life.  Oh, that's dangerous.  And I can't open the door on the outside because I'm going into the only lane they got to pass.  Now, on the inside, you've got parked cars there to open.  So you've still got to park out.  You know, sir, what do you think of those mail meter maids?  What do you think about those mail meter maids?  A little light in the loafers, if you know what I mean? 
[01:03:30]  Well, like I said, I can't say nothing really bad about them.  The two or three that I've talked to said that they usually will not do it.  Yeah.  Understanding.  But this one, there's a congestion over there every afternoon that I go there because you've got the people that are coming out in the morning shift and the people that are like me that go in.  So you've got two shifts coming in and you've got ambulance two, three, one car service there. 
[01:04:00]  That's just a ride.  Right.  Them two.  Yeah.  Moish's.  Then you've got the limousine service.  Oh, yeah.  You've got the funeral parlor on the corner.  Where are you going to park?  There was no place to park.  That's such a danger there.  No.  And they just stand there waiting for somebody to.  There's a place around one o'clock in the afternoon there.  Sometime between 12 and you'll see what goes on there. 
[01:04:30]  Hey, Eugene, how much was the ticket?  The ticket.  Well, you know, I couldn't even read it because it stuck to the flop of the envelope.  All the printing came off.  Oh, geez.  I had to call up the police.  First, I called 311 to find out how much it was.  And then I called up the police department.  They told me it was 115.  Wow.  I got Mr. Gentile, the consulman that's been handling this now.  That's how it wound up in the paper because I complained to him.  God bless you for complaining. 
[01:05:00]  Eugene, it's $115.  I got good news for you.  The Opie and Anthony show is going to pay for half that ticket.  Who's that?  Half.  Who?  No, don't do that.  What a cheapo Opie is.  Yes, sir.  I would say Opie is being a...  $15 towards that ticket.  He's being stingy.  We're willing to give you half the money for that ticket.  Well, I hope maybe the bail will send it back.  Let me tell you something, sir.  You will not have to pay that ticket.  They will throw that out because you're a fine man. 
[01:05:30]  She's legally blind, too.  And you guys have been...  She's blind.  I got the statement for that.  Yeah, yeah.  I sent that in.  I sent it in with the ticket.  Oh, okay.  So you already took care of it.  We were going to pay it for you to try to be like...  Well, half.  Oh, no.  Half.  Together for years.  He don't take charity.  This guy's got moxie.  I like you, Eugene.  He was in the war.  I know.  You wouldn't want any of these meter maids next to you, right?  If you were back in the war.  I don't know.  I think the two that I talked to about it were men. 
[01:06:00]  So they're more...  Yeah, yeah.  I understand.  But this woman, you know, she just was nasty.  Was she a pretty girl, Eugene?  Was she attractive at least?  Well, it was dark and raining.  Oh.  Oh, oh.  The outside.  Okay.  She didn't even...  I come out with a wheelchair and she dropped the ticket in there on the windshield and walked  away.  Oh.  She wouldn't say a word to me except, why don't you park over there?  I said, because it was taken when I got there. 
[01:06:30]  Jeez.  And that's the end of her.  You should have treated her like one of those Nazis back in WW2.  Wow.  I'll tell you that, my friend.  Yeah, well, she's got a lot to learn in life, I guess, you know.  So when it happens, some days, I hope it doesn't happen to her.  Yeah.  She's draining me, my wife.  She's draining me because I don't have the energy.  Oh, my God.  You are a saint, Eugene.  Hey, Eugene, how many Jerry's did you off?  How many what?  How many Jerry's did you off back in the big one? 
[01:07:00]  No, to tell you the truth, I just got up on the front line two weeks before it ended.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it ended and we met the Germans there.  I mean, the Russians.  The Russians, yeah.  He joined just in time for the party.  And you didn't get to...  No, I got there at the last battle.  The last battle was the night before, and there was all Germans all over the place, dead, you know.  Did you...  We dug in and we dug in and we won't... 
[01:07:30]  The Russians didn't want us to go into Berlin.  No, they want to take that all themselves.  They shook hands on the outside.  Yeah.  So we wouldn't go into Berlin.  I guess we had their own...  Yeah, agenda.  We saw how that ended up.  Right, right, right.  Oh, boy.  So you didn't get to fire your weapon?  Well, we got...  They weighed us down with all the, you know, with the bazookas and the hand grenades, and  we sweated it out a couple of nights, and then there was an ending. 
[01:08:00]  I was lucky.  Oh, you were lucky.  I'd like to play Call of Duty 4 with this guy.  Well, I was in the medics.  And because the Battle of the Bulge was so bad, they took us out and put us in the infantry.  Wow.  We had to take the infantry basic for a couple of months, and they shoved us up there.  As a medic, and then they have to make him a soldier, infantry.  Amazing.  Eugene, I just love this guy. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, who wouldn't love Eugene?  And the best of luck with this whole ticket thing.  I'm sure you'll never have to pay this.  Well, I don't know.  I don't know.  I just hope they do something and get rid of those two little crummy meters they got there.  If you go there, you'll see the one meter between the limousine service and the layoffs.  There's no more than a Volkswagen for fitting there.  Take your bazooka to it, Eugene.  That's what I say.  Yeah.  On 15th Avenue, there's the bus stop. 
[01:09:00]  And then there's...  Right, we know, we know, enough about the parking.  I love Eugene.  The only avenue's got three meter mates, and they're all around the dialysis.  Yeah, we get it.  I know.  Oh, my God.  All right, Eugene, we've got to take a commercial, but good luck to you, and good luck to your wife.  Thanks for coming on the show.  Is there anything we can...  Eugene, is there anything we can do for you?  Well, no, no, no.  I just hope I have the strength to take care of it.  Oh, my God.  The strength to take care.  This guy's a saint.  You've done enough already. 
[01:09:30]  All right, Eugene.  Thank you, Eugene.  Hang in there.  We're going to keep tabs on you.  Make sure you're all right, okay?  Okay.  Thank you for your concern.  Okay, sir.  That's Eugene, everybody.  Bye-bye.  The great Eugene.  Hey, Jimmy...  God deserves nothing but respect.  I've got a question for Jimmy, though.  Yeah.  Does this guy like talking about parking?  This guy doesn't like talking about parking.  He loves it!  I've never heard of a man who knows more about parking.  How do you not love that guy?  He's like, well, back, you know, in 1951, the parking regulations... 
[01:10:00]  He didn't know anything about parking.  He did sound like Martin Scorsese's mother.  Yeah, it was great.  I liked when there were two different fountains, drinking fountains.  Right.  I was just waiting for...  Oh, he was ready to go.  Yeah.  Then we have to take a break.  I'm going to coax him out of that.  We were loosening him up.  He was ready to speak his mind.  I'd like to have a few beers down at the VA with him.  Just an old guy, a veteran of a foreign war.  His wife is blind.  Of course.  People are just such pigs in this society, man.  People are just disgusting. 
[01:10:30]  There you go.  Respect.  That's what that man has earned.  Unbelievable story.  Good for him, because this broad thought she was getting away with something, and she  certainly didn't.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We've got Bob Kelly playing Carolines all weekend long, and we've got Donald Trump calling  next.  And he said a year ago he would never be on our show again, so we'll try to find out what  that's about.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, you're checking out Opie and Anthony.  Donald Trump should be on the phone any second here.  A lot of people are suggesting that we should play Is Eugene's Wife Alive Thursday? 
[01:11:00]  Oh, no.  Not nice, guys.  Not nice.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  Do we have time to play this thing again from earlier in the show?  Of course.  Because a lot of people are just waking up.  We're trying to get something stuck in your head today.  We're trying to get this stuck in your head today.  It's nice. 
[01:11:30]  It's Eugene.  There were parking spaces years ago.  Now I can't park in between.  There was a fanfare blowing to the sun.  Use that spot.  It's bigger.  I remember 1955. 
[01:12:00]  I won't say it.  Haunting, right, Bob?  Yeah.  Who is it?  What do you think it is?  Never guess.  I'll never guess?  Never.  Never guess.  Ever.  What do you think that is?  No way.  No way. 
[01:12:30]  George Foreman.  George Foreman?  No.  That is.  No.  The Great.  It's really good.  But strange.  Very strange, man.  Val Kilmer.  Yep.  Really?  That is Val Kilmer.  I can sing.  I want to thank TMZ for that.  I thought it was Dane.  Huh?  His new single.  Ron and Fez were playing that the other day.  We decided not to touch that song.  Ah, well, you go.  We decided to let it be.  I want to move up to a two-bedroom, so I'm going to actually let it be, too. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  You're going to leave that alone.  Ron and Fez did a good job with that the other day.  Did they move on it?  Maybe a little bit.  But that's Val Kilmer.  They played that on TMZ last night.  I went, oh, my God.  We got to play that on the show.  I guess he's got some kind of album out.  He's trying to do, like, I don't think he's trying to do a William Shatner, but I guess  he is doing a William Shatner.  No, I think he's trying to sing a little more than Bill Shatner did.  But they're calling it his William Shatner album.  Because it's his interpretation of these songs, I guess. 
[01:13:30]  But he really thinks he can sing because he did the doorstang, and he got some praise  for his voice in that.  So I think he's thinking, hey, I might have something here.  What a deluded prick.  I heard he was very difficult to deal with on the set of The Island of Dr. Moreau, which,  let's be honest, was not exactly an Oscar winner.  No.  But I heard Brando really gave him a good scolding.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Allegedly said something about, son, I think you're confusing your salary and your talent.  Ooh.  Because he was being difficult.  That's a good one.  What are you going to say? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You're Brando.  I love that Brando wouldn't learn his lines for that awful film.  They just put, like, a little earpiece in, and his guy read his lines, and he would just  say them when the cameras were, how confident are you as an actor?  I kind of want it to be organic.  Just tape the lines up.  I'll say them.  Oh.  And you still get the part, and they love to have you.  But he's, like, one of those weird, I love the fact that he just hated the old school  guys, because they showed no emotion, see?  Yeah.  And you'd hear that and just go, ugh.  That old acting where it was over the top. 
[01:14:30]  Oh.  Awful.  Yeah, and the women had, like, this weird, fake, English, American accent.  Like, breakfast at Tiffany's.  Like, hello, dear.  Yeah, let me tell you something.  Yeah, what is that?  What?  Just to stop.  Where's that from?  Yeah.  Getting back to the Val Kilmer thing.  We had some of the boys.  Iceman, I like to call him.  Yeah, we had some of the boys around here do their own version.  Me and Bobby just clenched our teeth like we were in Top Gun together in a locker room  in towels. 
[01:15:00]  Snapping at each other.  But Bob would have a bigger target.  Sorry.  A bigger target?  Wouldn't he have the bigger target?  I would have the bigger target.  No, you have, well, you have the bigger target on you, I guess.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  It kind of worked the way I said it.  It's kind of, yeah, it is.  I was just thinking, I was thinking of me being fat and him.  You're unsafe.  I'm unsafe.  Hey, yeah.  So, take a page from what we just played, the Val Kilmer thing.  Yeah.  We had some of the guys around here do their own version of After the Gold Rush. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, really?  Yes.  Yeah.  Right?  Good old Steve.  Mm-hmm.  His version of After the Gold Rush.  Yes.  Mm-hmm.  The King shall be received.  While I dreamed I saw knights in armor 
[01:16:00]  Coming, saying something about a queen  There were peasants singing  Drummers drumming  The archers split the tree  There was a fanfare blowing  To the sun  That was floating on the breeze  Look at Mother Nature on the run 
[01:16:30]  In the 1970s  Look at Mother Nature on the run  In the 1970s  That's haunting  I like that  There's nothing worse  It's just as good as Val Kilmer's  What's this guy doing? 
[01:17:00]  He thinks he can sing?  What is that?  Hey  Steve from Bayshore said  Wood yuck  Wood yuck  Yeah, he's the old wood ye  Well, we got Kenny trying his hand at the side  You didn't need the first part  But I'm like, Tim  Yeah  No  It's all about, you know, this on the radio  Quick, quick  Quick, let's, you know, get to its type of thing  Could have started right there  Exactly  God  Why don't you just record putting the CD in and hitting the button, too?

I don't think so  Oh, Steve from Bayshore  You just got scolded  I'm just trying to help Steve 
[01:22:00]  He said, Jimmy Shore told me  I don't need to be so hard, Steve  Hey, before we take a break  To get ready for Donald Trump  We got the bleep game  We played this one yesterday  We debuted this yesterday  It's worth another play  It's a very famous song  From a lot of our youths  And Danny took this song  And threw a few bleeps in  And it's drastically different  Yeah  Check this out as we go to break  On the Opie and Anthony show  I am here today 
[01:22:30]  To give you all a show and tell  And today, my show and tell  Is about my work  Most people want a doggie  Or a yellow parakeet  But if you ask me  I would say  There's nothing quite as neat  As a rock  My rock  It doesn't wag its tail 
[01:23:00]  And it doesn't sing all day  But you never have to walk it  And it doesn't run away  My rock  My rock  It's quiet and it's friendly  And it's always very neat  And you never have to bathe it  And it never has to eat 
[01:23:30]  Oh, you can have your hamsters  And your goldfish by the score  If I live to be a hundred  I will never ask for more  Than my rock  My rock  My rock  Upon what does a bullfrog like to hop  I rock  What once was our majestic mountain top  I rock  What once was at the bottom of the sea 
[01:24:00]  I rock  What hurts if I should drop it on your knee  I rock  What forms the firm foundation of a wall  I rock  What makes the very bestest pet of all  That's right  A rock  All poodlepups and parakeets  Are all you ever see  And rocks are only really loved by guys like me  But let me tell you, mister  If you had one, you'd agree 
[01:24:30]  There's nothing quite so wonderful  Or truly remarkable  As our  My old  State  Oh  This is Val Kilmer from Deja Vu  And you're listening to the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:25:00]  Very busy show  Tim is in the  In one of the studios  Working on the super mix  Super mix  We're going to have the super mix  Of after the goal rush  Before this show ends  It's the Opie and Anthony show  We got Bob Kelly  He's playing Carolines  In New York City  What, Friday, Saturday, Sunday?  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday  Yes, 10.30 shows  Friday, Saturday, and 8 o'clock show on Sunday  That is awesome  It sucks because the Patriots are playing  How are you going to drag yourself away from Xbox  And your gay clan 
[01:25:30]  Wow, you're in it  I know  I finally went gay  I finally went gay  I was  It was peer pressure  Because all the other gays  Were saying  Come on  Be one of the gay  And I finally  Put the gay in front of my name  It's fun when you're all in the room together  But then late at night  When you forget that you have the gay in front of your name  Yeah, then you just go in there  And I'm hoping they think it's an acronym for something cool  That sounds really bad  But I can't even think of something  It's spelled with two A's 
[01:26:00]  And that's supposed to make it better  Bob, because you thought of it  That's our clan name for Call of Duty 4  We got smart listeners  Maybe they could come up with something for you  What G-A-A-Y would stand for  There are some really cool ones  Killers and things like that  You know, some cool  TNT  Yeah, yeah  You see a Nazi  What?  There's a Nazi clan  Really?  Yeah, it's an N  And then a little A thing 
[01:26:30]  Yeah  And then the Z and a little I  And they got away with it  I don't know for how long  I don't know  Because they've been kicking people off  That are being derogatory  They stand out of the new queer  Oh, really?  Yeah  Queers taking on the gays  Yeah, we're going to  Oh, there's AIDS  There's HIVs  There's Jews  Like everybody's just throwing these stupid  Well, why would you come up with a  Who cares name?  Yeah  At least that's, you know, kind of fun  Yeah  But the thing is  It is 
[01:27:00]  We're all good, though  I mean, we're really good  Well, I'm working on this  Yeah, yeah  Is Ant the  I had a lot  Ant's holding you guys back, right?  Ant's name is always  They show you who the leaders are  At the end of the game  Who got the most  And who got the least  Yeah, I'm always on the bottom  This is called duty four  I don't know if you mentioned that  Yeah  But go ahead, yeah  Yeah, Ant is always  Noodles is always  Oh, thanks for mentioning my screen  Oh, God  What happened?  You mentioned my screen name  The other day on air  Three times on the air  And said it was mine  And I wanted friends  Just not to hurt your feelings  Only eight people 
[01:27:30]  I got a call that said  Your mailbox was full  And they couldn't even  Get any more in there  A blue healer from Kentucky  He's getting a lot of his feedback  Read these days  G-A-A-Y  He's got it  Right here  Guys  A  Guys A  Always yearning  That's not quite the acronym  We were looking for  How about this  Guys' asses are yummy  No, that's not the acronym 
[01:28:00]  We're looking for either  We try to be tough  We want to be a tough guy  Yeah, when the guy comes in  And goes  Gaze  What's that mean?  We can go  You know  Gusto  Action  Once you join me at  Gold Gym  And I'll tell ya  And by the way  I'll show ya  Last night  I did get a  Forty some odd kills  In one game  In one game?  Yeah, yeah  In a row  Or in one game?  Not in a row  In a game  Which is really good for me  So I'm getting there  But then the next game  I got like one kill 
[01:28:30]  And then I have to hear  One of the gays  I don't know which one it was  Might have been Coke Logic  Or something  I'm not sure  I'm blaming him  But I'm not sure  Say  Hey Anthony  Maybe you can get more  Than one kill next game  And then I just  Unleash the fury of curses  That are strung together  Nice  And it makes me very angry  That sometimes I just leave the game  Ben  You got something to add to this  Well just with the gay tag  People think  We don't realize it's gay  Like people come in  And be like  What are you, gay?  Yeah  You got us, dude 
[01:29:00]  And there are people  With the sound boxes  Hooked up to their mics  So when we go into  These various rooms  And play these teams  That start saying  Hey, we're playing the gays  They just play every clip  We've ever used  From this program  That relates to  Hardcore gay sex  In the middle of the game  Oh yeah  They'll just be hitting the button  And just the rudest  Rankest  Sexually gay  Material comes  As you're playing 
[01:29:30]  Blurting out  Into the game  Online  Some bad lieutenant drops  Yeah, yeah  Bad lieutenant drops  Who's playing them?  Just other gay  Other people on the gay  There's so many  But it's a good place  To meet other gays  There hasn't been one night  I haven't been able  To hook up with another gay  Yeah  And it's safe  By hooking up  On Call of Duty 4  A lot of times  On Xbox  On Call of Duty 4  You hook up  And it's not a safe room  No  It's a little carried  But you know  This is a place you can go  Where you as a gay 
[01:30:00]  Can go meet other gays  And have a friendly game  Of Call of Duty 4  Always  But these gays are good  Always willing to invite you in  It's a lot of fun  Very nice  These gays know  How to play the game  It's not just a bunch of  Silly boys  Running around  Shooting their guns up  In the air  Because they're happy  These guys are serious  I mean, you know  Too busy drilling holes  In the wall  To meet each other  And I see Dane  Won't take on the gay tag  Of course not  What's that all about?  Well, I mean  I don't know  He's not going to take it on 
[01:30:30]  Mr. Stab everyone  With a knife  Dude, let me tell you  Something about that  Knife trick  It's annoying  It's awful  You can use a knife  But it's just such a  And it scares the hell out of you  Because you've got to sneak up  And all of a sudden  What does that sound?  You're like  Yeah  They got the sound effects down  Oh yeah  You're getting your throat cut  Or getting stabbed  It's just  It's a sneaky  Nasty way  To kill people  And anytime I try it  I get a face full of shotgun  Or bullets  Or whatever's coming at me 
[01:31:00]  I can't sneak up on people  You were telling me  The other day  It's like  Oh, I hear  I hear Anthony  Just running around  Anthony  He doesn't  He plays the game  I hate people  Play the game  Like it's real  Like you're actually  Going to die  Like they hide in a corner  Like if they get shot  They die in real life  Like they'll just stay  But Anthony's  The totally opposite  Where there is some technique  You can crawl around  A little bit  And sneak  Anthony just runs  Like a Nigerian  In a marathon 
[01:31:30]  With an AK  All around the board  And then if he sees you  He'll start shooting  If he doesn't  He runs by you  Like he'll be hiding  In a corner  He'll just run by you  Like five times  Doesn't even see you  I'm going for the objective  The objective  Is to be stealthy  Slow down a little bit  I do  When I do that  I get stabbed in the back  Well, don't slow down  Totally  I can't figure out  The strategy  To keep myself  From being killed  And this is a big problem  When I'm stealthy  And I'm going around the corners  I get stabbed 
[01:32:00]  Or shot in the back  And then when I run  Like a maniac  I'm tap dancing  On other people's hand grenades  You gotta know when to run  And you gotta know when to crawl  But I do  No, you gotta  You gotta  Like run a little bit  Then when you see somebody  You gotta back up  And then you gotta  No, here's what I get  When I'm being a little stealthy  Hey, what are you doing?  Get the objective  What are you standing around for?  And I just go  Shut up, you  And then  The string of curses  Anthony does have a temper  Oh, man  Do I get mad 
[01:32:30]  Is this an intervention?  Are you secretly talking about  Anthony's play  Gameplay  When he's not online?  Oh, they all do  Is he the weakest link  On your team?  Oh, I suck  Yeah, well  Is this kind of a  Pet talk to get him going?  I'll tell you this  Fan came into the game  Right from the beginning  And picked it right up  I mean, he was  He was pretty good  Right off the bat  He could jump into a game  Pretty good  But, you know  When  When  Let's put it this way  We watch you back  While you're playing the game  Oh, no  I'm the little retarded child 
[01:33:00]  On the game  That's fantastic  You're the E-Rock  On the game  Oh, God  No  We watch you  We always have a guy  Ghosting you  Yeah, gosh  Stop it  Oh, no  We have a guy behind you  So sometimes  You'll actually kill somebody  And you didn't fire your gun  And you're like  Well, maybe it's a glitch  That's one of us behind you  Taking him out for you  We soften him up for you  Yeah, we soften him up  Oh, no  Wow  Don't even  That's Mickey telling Rocky  That he didn't fight  The toughest opponent  Oh, no 
[01:33:30]  That is not nice  It's also important to remember  That as  Much as Ant needs to improve  Let's put it that way  Travis is even worse  Travis  Oh, thank God  Travis is worse  Oh, good  It got off of me  For a second  The only person  Only time Ant's not at the bottom  Is when  It's when Travis is on  An even bigger bottom  I finished below Ant once  Oh 
[01:34:00]  And I was really upset about it  Hey  Damn  And I've gotten better  Because I got new weapons  You know  And I got my three frag grenades  Right  Those are good to have  So I use those  And, you know, that's good  Yeah, like  Anthony does  He is getting better  He's playing  Like Dane, though  Has that technique  That he  His own little  He uses claymores  And he puts them in  The front of the door  And the back of the door  Oh, is he annoying  With those damn things  So you can't get into the place  Without getting blown up  Does the guy ever fire a shot  To kill anybody?  He stabs people 
[01:34:30]  And sets bombs up  Ugh  That's what he does  And then he goes  And then he puts juggernaut on  Which is  You basically get extra health  So I can shoot you regularly  If you don't have it on  I'll shoot you  You'll die  If you have juggernaut on  I shoot you  You live  I shoot you again  You live a little more  You see this stupid red cross  Pop up  So you know they have  This juggernaut thing on  I didn't get that  And it's so annoying  You get to pick  What are called perks  Right  As you go  Advance through the levels  So why would everyone  Have that perk?  Because you might not  Want to use that  We're men  You might want to use  Deeper penetration perk 
[01:35:00]  No, we're not because of that  We're men  Which I think the gays use  Yeah, okay  It's mandatory to use the perk  I think we all have  The joke at the same time  But it's bullet  It's bullet penetration  Yeah, bullet penetration  And he uses the juggernaut  Juggernaut  We were playing him  The other night  How bad was it?  It was awful  It's  You know  Some people are very good at that  And then  There's this  You can level up  All the way up to level 55  And then you can give it all up  And start again at 1  And then level all the way up to 55 
[01:35:30]  Do it again  Again, again  And what is the  What gets you that gold cross?  That would be your 10th time  Attaining level 55  Running through to level 55  10 times  And there are people  That have this gold cross  That have done that  I won't do it  You won't do it?  I'm staying general  You're just going to stay general  I'm not losing my guns  My blue P90  I'm not giving up  Yeah  My golden  You got to start over  Yeah, you got to start over  Stan's done it 
[01:36:00]  He's on  You're on level what?  I don't know  I've lapped Travis  That's all  Yeah, he lapped Travis  I'm farther than my second  He's getting a little too close to me  To tell you the truth  Every night this week  My girl  I'll come home  She'll be showered  Ready to go  Oh boy  Ready to go  The bed's made  Candles are lit  Everything's ready to go  And I'll be like  Look, I'm just going to  I actually make things up  I got to talk to  Ant about something  He's on  The only way  I don't have  I got to go on here  I got to talk to Danes  And I'll go on  And then it will be  Like 6 in the morning 
[01:36:30]  She's downstairs  The blankets are all ripped off  She has no clothes on  But her blankets are ripped off  The dog's there  He's drooling  She's out cold  You missed your opportunity  Right  I'm not even kidding  All week  I was supposed to have  I said  I even verbally said  We'll have sex tomorrow  I swear to God  Oh man  I swear to God  But I can't put the game down  I feel like my boys need me  I feel like the gay clan  A band of brothers  A band of sisters  Is what the gay clan is 
[01:37:00]  And we're getting some comments here  Let me see  Bob, they're wondering  If you have a .45 caliber fork  If you've attained that level yet  I'm really going to lose weight  And I bet you'd put the game down  For a chocolate cake  Oh, that's not nice  So what, the guy  Everyone has a little obesity  You know, can I just say  You guys  Band of buffet  You guys said something funny yesterday  About me being a leader  Only in the game 
[01:37:30]  Oh, right, yeah  And then somebody said  He so wants to be a leader in life  Yeah, that was Jimmy  Of course  And the reason why that hurt my feelings  I was talking about that  In therapy that day  I was like, yeah  I just wanted  Like they listened to me in the game  I'm a leader  How can I take this in life  Bob wants to be respected  And thought of as a guy  Bob wants to be a go-to guy  Just once in his life  Like that's why he rehearses his speech  He wants people to go  God, he's right 
[01:38:00]  You know, dude, the terrorists  But it's always idiocy  Dude, the terrorists, dude  They're really bad  I want to respect you  Dude, I want you to  But I have to agree with you totally  I am just a hunk of garbage  That wants a pack of people behind me  And it's never going to happen  It's never, I've wanted it my whole life  Back when I used to drink  I used to drink with people  And I wanted a little pack  But you know why I can't have  I'm not a leader in life  I can't have people  Because I'm too aggressive, too  When people do start to  Hey, what are you doing? 
[01:38:30]  I get mad  And I just say mean stuff  And I treat them like crap  Yeah  And then they leave me for somebody better  Which is anybody  Oh, boy  Let's go to Max in Dallas real fast  Max  Max  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey  Maybe Staving Private Kumia  And Bob could blow Dana up  With a sticky bomb  Using their socks  Staving Private Kumia  Ant's like Inspector Gadget  We kind of help him along  He has no idea  It's all coming out now 
[01:39:00]  I've admitted  This is the first game  I've been bad at  Are you playing it on  I really  Well, maybe it's what you play  You're playing it on like a 13-inch TV  Yeah, that's what I'm playing it on  What are you using?  Playing it on like a 52-inch plasma  It's actually real life  It is  It hurts when I get hit  Reaches out and smacks me  All right, listen  We got breaking news here  Breaking news  What?  Oh  What?  He's not coming on  Who? 
[01:39:30]  Trump  How do you know?  I'm just assuming  Oh, I'm assuming, too  I'm not  Oh, I said that was the news  Oh, no, no  I don't care  I don't care either way  To be honest with you  We'll have fun with Donald Trump  If he calls  But it's not looking good  He was supposed to call at, what, 730?  And then they said he's running late  And now it's, you know  We're running out of show here  What's the breaking news?  Breaking news  Clemens  You're a Red Sox fan?  Yeah  He'll always be a Red Sox to me, by the way  I don't acknowledge his years with the Yankees  Really?  No, I really don't  I don't think we acknowledge him either anymore 
[01:40:00]  You can have him  No, but we got breaking news  We got audio  Press conference that just went down  Wow  Clemens  I want to say thanks to this Mitchell report  I've been getting emails and questions on this subject  And now the whole world knows  The answer is that I use steroids  Over the last 15 days or so  When I played in Toronto for the Blue Jays  Brian Mack and me used steroids  To inject into my body  And I'm very thankful for those steroids  And it's been extremely difficult to do this 
[01:40:30]  I'm almost numb to steroids and human growth hormones  I'm angry about it, to be honest with you  It's hurtful to have thousands of people  To inject human growth hormones into my body  My friends inject steroids into my body  The New York Yankees  To inject human growth hormones into my body  My children use drugs  And it means a lot to me  In my family  To inject steroids  Again, it's amazing to me 
[01:41:00]  That I have to even use steroids  And I want to say thanks to Brian McNamee  The New York Yankees  After Christmas  I'm going to sit down with Mike Wallace  Of 60 Minutes  And I'll inject drugs into my body  Right there in front of him  And we'll do all this again  And let me be clear  That I'm very thankful for those steroids  And Mike Wallace used drugs  Now that that's come out  My children to inject steroids  Into Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes  But we're coming upon Christmas now 
[01:41:30]  And I have been blessed in my life  I've been blessed in my career  And the answer is that I use steroids  Hey, there you have it, man  What can I tell you?  His kids injected Mike Wallace with drugs?  Finally  Wow  It has come out  That's hysterical  That's funny  Somebody actually sat and did that  He did a great job with that  He certainly did  Alright, hey, dead guy  Check cashing story  One more comment 
[01:42:00]  Sure, sure  People, Bob  They're so mean to Bobby Kelly  Why?  Saying that every time he goes into battle  It's the battle of the bulls  You know  You've got to give it to him  That's a good one  That's kind of a good one  I'd love to get angry at him  But that's a pretty good one  That's pretty funny  It's just not necessary  You've got to take the hits  Yeah  I'm sorry, Bob  I didn't treat you that way  Oh, that's good  Well, you know what?  I could always do something about it  And that is probably lose weight  Nah  And get in shape  Why bother?  I was thinking more of the full metal jacket solution 
[01:42:30]  Oh, no  Would blow my head off?  Yes  That's terrible  In a bad truth  What's wrong with you?  Nothing  Front page of the paper  Yay!  Front page of the  Front page of the paper  We touched on this yesterday  Meet the two scheming dopes  Who wheeled their dead buddy  Into a check cashing store  Dumb, dumber, and dead  You heard about this, right, Bob Kelly?  A little bit, yeah  Yeah, basically, what?  This guy's roommate died  And I think there was like 
[01:43:00]  A social security check laying around  You're kidding!  He called up a buddy of his  And said, hey  Let's cash this check  Well, how are you going to do that?  Well, we'll wheel him around  Make believe he's sick  We'll leave him outside  Some kind of cash checking joint  And when they ask, you know  Where is the guy  That this check is  What?  Did you say cash checking joint?  No, no, did you say that?  Okay, I think he did  It just hit me  What?  What?  Did you say cash checking?  What?  Check cashing?  I go cash checking joint 
[01:43:30]  No, check cashing  No, but you get the cash  For the check  No, I will not let you  Get away with that one  No  Embrace this  It's time to embrace this  Okay, it's a cash checking joint  I did get what you meant  Thank you  I did get it  It does make sense  Thank you  But we have to call each other out  On everything  Just embrace it  You should come up with  A dictionary for this  Cash checking joint  So they went to a cash checking joint  Yeah  And they tallyated  How much this check was worth 
[01:44:00]  Tallyated  Was worth  Did they just get done  Watching Weekend at Bernie's?  Wow  No, we've been making that reference  Exactly  Wow, right  We even have this ready to go  Look, look  See?  See?  You thought you bombed  But you did  Just once in life  Come on, let's go  Come on, everybody  Follow Bob  Yeah  Yeah  And then I look back  And all the little animated characters  Are just looking at me  No  They're just all going off  In different directions 
[01:44:30]  I dearly do motivate though  You can't rally the troops  There was one time  This way, dude  He pictures himself  Come on  You take the flank  I'll take that way  Okay, Bob  Whatever you say, Bob  Alright, dude  What are you doing?  Bob said to do that  And I'm doing that  Dude, I told you to do that  And then he gets cocky  Because they do start following  You go back  That's how Bob gets when he's mad  He would point and be abusive  You go back  You hang out here  Alright, Bob 
[01:45:00]  You're the man  Just once  Well, I did motivate my group  From a deficit  We were way behind  And I said  Guys, don't give up  We're going to win this  Don't give up  We still got a chance  You get that head  We still got a shot  Let's take A  And I went in  I got killed for my guys  And I showed them how it was like  I do that all the time  Yeah, you do  Meat shield  So then they're at the cash checking joint  We're all over the place  Check cash  Which is great  Cash checking, yes 
[01:45:30]  Cash checking, yeah  I'm going to stay with that  I like that music  And then like the teller person or whatever  Says, where's this dude that this chick is made out to  And they point outside the cash checking joint  Yeah, he's right out there  And he's kind of like in a wheelchair  Or actually like an office chair, I believe  It was an office chair with wheels  That they wheeled down the street  Yeah  And covered it  Yeah  And his head was tilted all the way back into the side  Over the back of the chair  And they wheeled him down there  And said, yeah, he's right out there  Instead of having a guy out there with him 
[01:46:00]  Like fixing his ties  Saying he's old  He's really sick  Yeah, yeah  He's like, you know, do something like that  Yeah  They just left him out there  Left him out there  The rats are gnawing on his nose  Slies coming out of his mouth  It's like  He didn't think this completely through  No  He's sleeping in that little pine bed  Yeah  Put a little hot dog in his hand  Then a grape apire in the oven  Yeah  I love New York t-shirt  You gotta give him a little credit for this  You know, for giving it a shot though, man  Almost brilliant  They almost got away with it 
[01:46:30]  So, the reason we're on this story again  Because it brings up something Jimmy brought up a while back  Fox 5 here in New York introduced the story  And they start with the expert opinion  On this story  Good  Of a random woman on the street  I like the local flavor  It always helps the story  Jimmy's a big fan of the local angle  And a big fan of the man on the street  Sure  That gives an interview for every news story  You know why?  That adds nothing to the story  I was just gonna say  Because they add so much  They do  Local residents 
[01:47:00]  Local flavor  Yeah  Local flavor  Listen to the expert opinion  Of a random woman on the street  Oh, I couldn't believe it  That the dead should be respected  Really?  And then we like to try to figure out  What they really should be saying  That the news never gets  It's just nonsense  They never  Who cares with their opinions  Their opinions are not news  Local  Like what's a local resident  Gonna say  Very common here  For the dead  To be pushed around  In office chairs  In a check cashing scheme  It's been happening for years 
[01:47:30]  We just took it for granted  Thought it was fine  They never say that  Oh, Pat Duffy  Helping out the show today  He writes  The chair had no arms either  And his arms and legs  Were dragging behind the chair  Behind it?  Oh, that's great  That must have looked fantastic  And the news  The stupid news, right?  They get a wobbly  Like office chair  And they get the perspective  Of the chair  Going down the sidewalk  With the wobbly wheels  That's all you see  To kind of like  Reenact what it might  Don't look like  The dead man perspective 
[01:48:00]  Yeah  Here we go  Here's Fox 5  Well, this next story  Sounds like it came  Straight out of the movie  Weekend at Bernie's  But as Fox 5's  Lisa Evers reports  That  It helped their news reports  Right  He came up with the joke too  Well, this next story  Sounds like it came  Straight out of the movie  Weekend at Bernie's  But as Fox 5's  Lisa Evers reports  The family of the man  Two friends used  As part of an elaborate  Check cashing scheme  Elaborate?  This is no joking matter  No joking  You have a problem  With the elaborate part, Jimmy?  It's no joking matter  They brought him in  With like a marionette stick 
[01:48:30]  And raised his arm  Like, where is the guy?  And the other guy  Operated the stick  And he waved  That's elaborate  They left a cadaver  On the street  In an office chair  And went to cash his check  That's very basic  No, Ocean's 11  It really is  Not elaborate thing at all  It's the polar opposite  Of elaborate, actually  A very simplistic  And poorly thought out plan  Yes  This guy's making it seem  Elaborate?  I want to enjoy the  It's not Ocean's 11 line  A little more  That is good  It's the family of the man 
[01:49:00]  Two friends used  As part of an elaborate  Check cashing scheme  Say this is no joking matter  I think it's very sad  That that happened  65 year old David Deloia  In the black hat  And James O'Hare  Also 65  In the red sweater  Were taken out  Of the Midtown  North Precinct  It's very sad  That it happened  How do people not  Find this hilarious  How could you find it sad?  It's sad 
[01:49:30]  They would not be using  My sound player  On the news  I would just be  Openly laughing  You'd be cracking up  Good  Right  It's funny  What?  They did what?  They're getting right?  I like the fact  That the news anchor  Makes a joke  And then says  That the resident's  Relative says  No joking matter  Well then why'd you  Make the joke  At the weekend at Bernie?  We made the joke  Yeah  Yeah  I mean there's plenty of rapes  You don't ever hear  You're going  You know  We have a story  It's like right out  Of the accused  Jesus 
[01:50:00]  Why?  Talking about pinball machines  I mean if that's a legitimate piece of reporting  Why not do it with everything?  Good point Jimmy  Good point  Alright part two  They recapped the story  And talked to one of the neighbors  Of the accused  What do you think  The neighbor of the accused  Is going to be  Shocked  Shocked  I'm shocked  You know  He's a nice guy  I just don't see him  Doing something like this  He was a very likable man  Yeah  Didn't cause any trouble  Hope it's not true  I never saw him wheel a dead person 
[01:50:30]  I just don't believe it  I guess you have respect for the dead  If it's true  It's just terrible  Just once I want to hear one of these neighbors  It's about time  I knew something was going on  With this creep  Pull up his floorboards  There's something in his apartment  Cops say that the two  Wheeled the body of 66 year old  Virgilio Cintrón  From his apartment here on  West 52nd Street  To the check cashing place  Around the corner 
[01:51:00]  The clerk at the pay-o-matic  Check cashing store  Didn't buy their story  Police arrived  And arrested the two men  Now neighbors of Mr. Cintrón  Don't know what to think  In my personal opinion  Whatever happened inside the apartment  Can be a different story  So we  I don't know  Outside  There was  So in a case  What?  I have no idea  What she was trying to say  What?  It's hard to hear  With the music  Yeah, yeah  I'm sure she was not babbling  And making no sense at all  I'm sure she was saying  Something very insightful 
[01:51:30]  Yeah  What?  Police arrived and arrested the two men  Now neighbors of Mr. Cintrón  Don't know what to think  In my personal opinion  Whatever happened inside the apartment  Can be a different story  So we  I don't know  Outside  There was  Very nice guys  Whatever happened inside the apartment  Yeah  Could be a different story  Yeah  But what happens  Yeah  Outside  I don't know  It was good 
[01:52:00]  I'm glad she made that point  She always needs to tie the story together  Yeah  And I think that she had a well thought out  Sure  Theory  That just my personal opinion  That whatever happened inside the apartment  Is different  Something, something, something  I don't know  I think  I think that news person  Could get an award for that interview  Absolutely  Yeah  That brought so much to the story  A Cleo  A Cleo  Isn't that for the commercials  Oh  Emmy 
[01:52:30]  News Emmy  News Emmy  News Emmy  News Emmy  News Emmy  How about a News Oscar  Edward R. Murrow  I'm gonna go with a News Oscar  Who knows what you get  News Oscar  Yeah  News Oscar  Jennings toes  On a Trophy  A News Purple Heart  Wow  Alright, take that one  Oh, there you go  But how did the people get caught?  I mean, it's a death 
[01:53:00]  Where they hung around until the cops came?  Dude, everyone  Everyone that was on the street that day  Knew this was a serious  There was a dead guy outside  Because the head was flopping  The legs were dragging  There was a cop next door  At a coffee joint  And he saw it too, right?  Yeah, he came over  Yeah, everybody  Everybody noticed that this was not right  They should have had a blind  They should have thought it through a little bit  Or carried the guy like a baby  And then whenever he talked  A guy should have went  Yeah, I'm tired  Should have had Otto and George 
[01:53:30]  Kind of like those brilliant  That's the check  Kind of like those brilliant scenes  Die  From Weekend at Bernie  It was very believable  When he was at the party  And they were making his arm move  And stuff  Yeah, they put sunglasses on  Yeah, it was very believable  Stapled the hat to his head  Supermix time  Supermix  Supermix  Supermix  Neil Young  I like the mix  Bob, Supermix time  I like it  Val Kilmer  We played it earlier  Do we have that?

[02:05:00]  Redoing Neil Young after the Gold Rush  He's doing this as a serious piece  He's not trying to be a goof like William Shatner was  This is a piece of Val Kilmer doing after the Gold Rush  Well, I dreamed I saw the night in armor coming  Saying something about a queen  There were presents singing  And drummers driving 
[02:05:30]  And the archer split the tree  There was a fanfare blowing  To the sun  That was floating on the breeze  Look at Mother Nature on the run  In the 21st century  Yeah 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, haunting, right?  That's good  Heartburn Ridge  Saving Ryan's portions  Anyway  I can't stop  I just can't stop  I know, it's not  It's too goddamn funny  Oh my god  Gettysburger  Joe City from Red Bank  Wow, wow, wow, wow 
[02:06:30]  Anyway, so  Yeah  So we had the gang around here  The guys that  Oh, there's Donald Trump  He's gonna be on Regis and Kelly  Of course  Get rolling in here  I'd like to find out what happened with  What happened?  With the Donald  He blew us off, that's all  Yeah, he obviously blew us off  We can acknowledge that  So we had Roland  We had Steve  And we had Kenny  Also do after the Gold Rush  And then we have Val Kilmer  So Tim took all of this  And made a super mix 
[02:07:00]  Ladies and gentlemen  The super mix of  After the Gold Rush  Oh, he's had to start  With this part though  The King shall be received  Well, I dreamt I saw the knights in armor coming 
[02:07:30]  Saying something about a queen  There was a fanfare that was floating on the breeze  There was a fanfare that was floating on the sun that was floating on the breeze  Look at Mother Nature on the run  Look at Mother Nature on the run 
[02:08:00]  In the 1970s  Look at Mother Nature on the run  In the 1970s  Wow  I like the big ending there  We got a hit on our hands  Roland, what happened with the Donald?  Hold on, let me get you  I called and left messages and emails 
[02:08:30]  And they haven't responded back  Yeah  It's the big blow-off  So why don't they at least admit that?  I know, I'm going  Why are they avoiding us?  Huh?  I know, I'm going to find out this afternoon  Because they haven't called back or emailed  Did I make a mistake by reading the post thing from a year ago, maybe?  Maybe  Well, why shouldn't you be able to, though?  I mean, in fairness, you didn't trash him  No one said he sucks  He said we were slobs  I'm more annoyed at Ice Cube  That his people  I'm sure it wasn't him  But his people passed on our show 
[02:09:00]  To go on this lily-white fox and friends  What's the matter with you?  Just stop  He was in Three Kings-sized portions  How the way Rowan's face looks like  You ever use iChat and put the effects on it?  Sorry, Rowan  I'm saying sorry to everybody  I think Eugene got to me today  Poor Eugene 
[02:09:30]  Remember the a la mode  And stop  Oh, these are all good ones  Yeah  Well, instead of  Tora, Tora, Tora  Yeah  Sean M. from somewhere  Says, taco, taco, taco  No  Oh, wait a minute  I never see you so sheepish  What's sheepish?  What do you mean sheepish?  Hey  What?  What are you talking about sheepish? 
[02:10:00]  He's kind of like  Wait, so  Let me tell you something  They're all good ones  Yeah  They're all damn good ones  If there was a couple bad ones in there  And they took it in the wrong direction  Every single person that had a real good one  They're very funny  You gotta take the hit  Wait, so Ice Cube blew us off  Of that crappy show?  For Fox 5's morning show?  Yeah  With that lily-white show  You know how many more listeners we have?  Than that dumb local crap?  Who's his rep?  Who's his rep that blew us off?  Who are they?  I'll get you the name  Who are they?  You can tell us  Why is it a secret? 
[02:10:30]  I don't know  Why would Ice Cube blow us off for that crap?  Do you know  I would understand for maybe another radio show or something  But that crap there's  They popped a picture of Mr. T up next to him  Yeah  To like compare the two  Whoa  They're showing like desserts and stuff  And recipes  It's pretty bad though  Oh now we can admit that the movie's bad  His last two projects  He did multiple XM channel shows from XM Jazz  That sucks  And then the Donald just completely blew us off  And they're just hiding now, right? 
[02:11:00]  I thought he's a brave man  At least come on and say  Look, I didn't realize that I was talking to you guys today  I don't want to talk to you  Yeah, I'll call and find out  Alright  He's supposed to be this brave man  You know, if he's supposed to be on a show  And then something happened  Then someone should at least tell us why  I know, I agree  He likes, you know  You know  Chatting about everything  And being brave about everything  Yeah, Mr. Confronts big fat women  So if there's a problem  He should have  A, himself came on and said 
[02:11:30]  Look, I don't like you guys anymore  I don't want to talk to you anymore  I just wanted to say that much  Or have someone from his camp call  Go screw  Or  Someone from his camp at least  Communicate that to you in an email  Or a text or something  Yeah, the last thing I got was  It's all confirmed for today  Well, he's going to be on Regis in a few minutes  So  So obviously he's not going to be on our show today  But he could have done it at 7.30  Of course he could have  We'll try to find out what that's all about tomorrow  That's it  I'm more annoyed at Ice Cube  I could care less about Trump  But Ice Cube  The fact that his people would blow us 
[02:12:00]  Or say no to this show  They're so stupid about doing television  He's only doing television  Yeah  Why?  That show doesn't get the audience we get  Nope  When are they going to wake up?  TV is not  Dummies  I wish Trump came in  It's not that glamorous for your people  If Trump came in  I wouldn't have took such a pounding today  Well  What dummies  Plus we would have gave Ice Cube  Half hour, 40 minutes minimum  They're going to give him a five minute segment  Hey, he's done  Forget it  It's over  What? 
[02:12:30]  What, Tom?  Oh, boy  What happened?  Oh, boy  Always a problem  What's today's problem?  What happened?  What's today's problem?  Go ahead, Tom  We had a great show today  But now we have to leave wondering  Maybe it's not  Maybe it's okay  No, it's never good  Go ahead  Do you think the blow-off  Had anything to do with the fact  That yesterday during the show  You said that he was going to call in  And you called him a publicity whore  And that that was the promo  That the station ran after that?  Did we?  Oh, really?  Yeah, remember we did 
[02:13:00]  See, we're a little groggy when we leave  To go over to XM  When you picked the promo  That was what you picked?  Wait, do we have the promo?  See, you should have came in here with the promo  That's true  Now we can at least play it  We should play the promo  Because it was really  Do we have it really fast?  That's hilarious  You know, we have to think  That's really funny  We have to think in advance  A little more than we are  I don't want to say  Two plus two usually equals four  But maybe  I thought you were coming in to go  You know, make sure everyone knows  That Clemens thing wasn't real  That's what I really thought he was coming in for  He didn't know it until you just said it 
[02:13:30]  Yeah  He did not  You know, I hope everybody does know  Of course  Oh, Tom  Tom, of course  Oh, you know what?  You can't blame Trump for blowing  You can't  Wait, so this promo's running all day  How are those one-vision eyes?  What's that?  How are those one-vision eyes?  Unfortunately, they're working perfectly right now  Why, because you're looking at Bob?  No  Oh, nice  Hey, braces  Don't make fun of me, all right?  Midlife crisis  What's wrong with braces?  That's six years old 
[02:14:00]  You know what?  My uncle got it, too  What's up with, like, guys in their, like, later years  Getting, fixing their teeth  Exactly  Oh, he called you  Some of us aren't willing to give up in middle age  All right  Oh, wow  Some people don't want to give up in their middle age  Wow  That was a good one, Tom  I'm getting it from all angles  Oh, are you getting nailed?  I got a suit's on fire today  Wow  Tom's implying that you'd never get braces  I got it  Shut up, no chin  The friction would set his tongue on fire 
[02:14:30]  All right, listen  Here's, be like, flint in his mouth  You know, I hate to admit this  But Tom might be onto something  Larry flint on his body  Tom might be onto something today  All right, let's listen to  This played all day long after we got off the air, right, Tom?  Yeah  Okay  Here we go  Hey, guys, Opie and Anthony here  I just want to let you know  Tomorrow on the show  Donald Trump  He said he would never call our show again  What?  He didn't like us  We are going to talk to Donald Trump tomorrow  Why?  He needs promotion, obviously 
[02:15:00]  Oh, okay  He's a whore  All on the next Opie and Anthony show  92.3 K-Rock  Okay  All right  He's the type of guy that would probably take that seriously  And not be happy  Yeah  All right, Tom  One for you  What can I tell you?  One for you  Just one  You know  I got to say it  It was on the paper  Star Wars 2  Attack of the Calzones  God, I thought we were out  Oh, we are  Wow

[02:35:00]  It smells like fish  That should mean it's delicious  Yeah  So how does this thing work Bob?  Walk us through it  Alright first of all  It's a toilet seat  My toilet seat broke  So I had to get a new toilet seat  A toilet seat  Of course it did  Wow  Suicide  My toilet seat was found  Hanging in the closet  I think  It broke  Enough  It actually broke  Because to dry my feet  I have to put my foot  On the toilet  And I always put my foot  On the toilet 
[02:35:30]  And I would move  The seat over  And after time  It broke off its hinges  Why are you drying your foot  On a toilet seat?  Because I can't bend down  And touch my feet  And there's nowhere else  You can put your foot  How are you drying it?  Where am I going to put it?  In the bathroom  On the counter  What counter?  Who has a counter?  Sorry, money bags  I don't have a counter  In a dressing room  To have a counter  In a bathroom  Is money bags?  A counter?  Yes  Like you have your sink  But then around there  You have a bank  No dude, around the sink  But around the sink  That's way too high 
[02:36:00]  I'm a gymnast  In the third bathroom  The sink counter  Is way high  You can't bring your leg up to there  I can't put my foot up there  You have four counters  You have four bathrooms?  I have four  Are you kidding me?  Ant's got six  You have six?  How many do you have?  There are some bathrooms  I haven't seen  Look there  For a year and a half  I use some of my bathrooms  For storage  Oh  That's  What a disgusting display  Oh my god 
[02:36:30]  I have  I have one bathroom  That's amazing  I redid it  So it's amazing  If you're ever over my crib there  Don't push aside the shower curtain  What?  What's in there?  Are you storing shit in your shower?  Dude, I don't need four bathrooms  What are you, in the mafia?  You can't store shit in your bathtub  Do you have guns in your stove?  So the bidet  Sound like I had a mouthful of jism  Again  Again 
[02:37:00]  I had to get a new toilet seat  A hundred dollars for a new toilet seat  Get out of here  Swear to god  Cut it out  You're lying  Don't be so fresh  I swear to god  I would never lie to you, Jamie  A hundred bucks for a new toilet seat?  Well, for you  What was it?  Carbon fiber?  It was actually  Titanium  The Pavarotti auction  Are you laughing at me or him?  I'm laughing at you  Because of what Jimmy said  I said one too  The Pavarotti auction  That's what I said  I said it was made out of a Mac  A what?

[02:38:00]  Did you come up with that?  Or did you read it?  I just came up with it  All by myself  So I had to get into the toilet seat  But I have one of those push button toilets  Where you push the button on the top  It's not like a flush on the side  Oh, yeah  Fucking live at train station  Exactly  Is fucking Abe Fagoda  Going to hide a gun behind it?

[02:54:00]  He's got his foot on my wall  In his socks  And I'm jerking off  And she's eating his ass  And what was the noise she made  She went  Like she was gonna  Like that  Cause she was gonna puke right  I'm gonna puke  And then all Jimmy heard was this  He had a piece of fucking paper  In his fucking asshole  Cause it was this hot summer night  And I must have wiped my ass  And a couple of the fucking  The nougat hairs got in there  Or some type of sock lint  Got on my asshole 
[02:54:30]  And she's just  I mean my foot  My foot was up by my shoulder  On the wall  My asshole was wide open  And this girl was on her  On the floor  On her knees  Burying her face in my ass  And I could just see  Like Jimmy  Way in the distance  Way in the distance  I saw him like  Sticking his head out  And she's just munching on it  All of a sudden  She gagged on your ass  She  Something went in her mouth 
[02:55:00]  And it must have tasted like shit  And then she went  Trying to just spit it out  Oh my god  And I just started laughing  She's a lady  You know what I said  I actually said  Get that  Get that  Yeah get that  By the way  I chose this moment  To eat my egg white sandwich  Thanks Bob  There you go  I think it actually  Probably looked like  A hunk of egg white  I'll never forget  His sock foot  Up on my wall  Getting his ass eaten  While he jerked off  On the fucking sofa  Watching from the other room  Wow

[02:56:00]  You're the one who told me about that  Oh maybe  I don't even know  I remember you were  Eating her pussy  I remember  What happened was  Jimmy can't do it  With anybody in the room  He's not a  He can't pull a train  Yeah  You know if someone  He's just like  Dude you gotta  So I had to go like  Sit in a corner  Behind the lamp  And shut all the lights out  And not make a noise  So he could fucking  Get his rocks off  Cause the girl  The girl knew me  She didn't know him  So I really couldn't leave  So I kinda had to be there  But he was like  Yeah I can't do it  I can't  Can you leave  I was like  I'll go over here  So I'm in the corner  Like squatting down 
[02:56:30]  Behind the lamp  And he  He's a  I mean I gotta give  Jim credit  He's  When he  When he goes to town  When he goes down  On a woman  He is a  God damn  I was almost  Trying to take notes  He's  He's got a technique  I've never seen  His tongue  Is like a fucking  Like a hummingbird wing  And it's most of his  Punch lines in his act  But  But  But 
[02:57:00]  Amazing  I mean he just  Made this chick blow  Nut after nut  And he doesn't  He gets like  This face  That like  He gets like  A weird face on  Like almost like  He turns into  Like a little  Sex monster  Really  Yeah he's like  He just starts  Looking at the pussy  Angry like  Yeah  It is all  Probably anger  Coming out  I love  I  If a girl has a good pussy  To eat  Oh yeah  And uh  I think this girl  Had a good pussy  To eat  I really will spend  A long time  If a girl can take it  Cause I loved it  It's fucking  There's nothing 
[02:57:30]  Sexier than that  Yeah I woke up  I took a nap  I woke up  The sun was coming up  Yeah  Yeah  She came a bunch  Oh god  And she  You know  And he totally  Made me look bad  Cause you know  After that  It was like  You know  I'm  He does some  Technique  Where he takes  The  You get the clit  Or something  You got a  Of course you suck  You get the clit  Or something  Yeah  That's good  Well no  I get  You catch it  In a fucking  In a sting operation  You actually  Take your  Take your finger 
[02:58:00]  And rub it on your nose  No you fucking  It's about  You suck the lips  A little bit  Of course you tease  The clit  But then  It's hard to describe  It's almost like  You put your  The top teeth  Kind of  Or your  Like  Hold on  Yeah like  Do I use my asshole  As a pussy  Just  Sometimes I'll put my  Top of my teeth  Very gently  Against the top  Of the clit  To kind of hold  So I can kind of  Know exactly where it is  And you just lock  Your lip under it  Softly  And then you just  Kind of like  Oh  It's very common 
[02:58:30]  I mean  Listen to this  Do that again  Listen  No listen  I want to hear  The little sound you make  Here's the noise I make  When I'm eating pussy  You also have to use  Some facial pressure  That works too  As you're doing that  Yeah like Alex and 
[02:59:00]  Cluckwork  Orange  Like a fucking pie in the face  It's like Laurel and Hardy  Pussy eating  I'm eating a pussy  Stanley my face smells  Like a fish hatchery  You know if you  Stanley I've earned  My blood wings  With this cherry pie 
[02:59:30]  There's a face right in it  Her vagina looks like  A punched mouse  I don't like this one  It looks like it's full of custard  Her vagina smells like a baker's 
[03:00:00]  I've never heard of seaweed pie  I've never heard of seaweed pie  That's funny shit  God damn  God you're funny  Yeah  So Bob  I'm trying to even know  If you have to use face pressure  Yeah yeah yeah  When you're doing that  You know you use everything 
[03:00:30]  From your chin  And your nose  Everything  Yeah I like that  Just to like  Push on the other areas  Around what you're focusing on  Well you don't need to push it right away  They like this  Because you suck the thighs a little bit  And you  Maybe nibble  Not too hard  Depends on what they can take  I like to like  Kind of suck on the lips  Real soft up  And then you just ignore the clit  For a little while  You pretend  It's like a hot chick in the room  Ignore it  You don't look at the clit  And the clit kind of swells up  Like what about me  Ignore it  Hey  Hey you're not there as far as I don't see you  I tell you 
[03:01:00]  You know what you do  And then when it gets really swollen  Hold on  You take the clit  And you pinch it as hard as you can  And you hit it like a speed bag  And you go  Are you gonna come  You grab it like it's a fucking turkey neck  Strangle that clit  I like to  I like to  I like to  Push the lips in really hard  And make the clit pop up  And look silly  Like hello  Like a stressed almost  Like making a slipknot  Out of a guitar string 
[03:01:30]  And wrapping it around it  And make it look like Luca Brasi  You pat her thigh  And then choker clit  With a guitar string  Her fucking dumb lips open up  Luca Brasi smells like the fishes  What a misogynistic show we're having today  Fucking shit in your mouth 
[03:02:00]  And rip off your cliff  Next on Regis  Hey Bob the wife  And the bidet  Does she use it?  What does she think of it?  Well  I can't imagine getting one of these things  Can I just say something  Before that  Another thing that I like to do to girls  Oh okay sure  That is really hot  And it sounds a little weird  But it really gets chicks hot  If you eat their armpit out  Like a pussy  I love that  Seriously  Eat their armpit like a pussy  And finger fuck them 
[03:02:30]  No deodorant though  No deodorant  Armpits smell can be really sexy  If the chemistry is right  Between you two  That can be fucking hot man  Yeah no deodorant  You'll fuck  No I like no deodorant  Because the deodorant is nasty  Do you have sex with the armpit or what?  You eat her armpit  No actual sex  No  It's a fetish out there  I fuck the girls ass crack  It's called axilism  I don't know what it's called  But you're right  There is a fetish for it  It's called axilism  Look it up  It's weird  Look it up there  That's either when you fuck an armpit  Or a Guns N' Roses CD  You know what I like to do too?

We gotta finish up the bidet  Or she thinks you're like a creep  She uh  No she  My girl

[03:13:30]  Followed by the big boot  Is not something  You could beat  Yeah okay  Well the best part  About the rock  Is when he came out  He did all four corners  Of the ring  And put his ear up  To the  Just like  Like Elvis  He was Elvis  He was Elvis of wrestlers  He was wrestling again  Ah with that eyebrow  How great was the eyebrow  The people's eyebrow  After every interview  Right at the end  He'd give it to you  And then he'd have to  Adjust to how his head was  With his own hands  Yeah  And put his eyebrow up  It was like voguing  I'm gonna watch

[03:14:30]  He's down  Why do I jump over  Oh that's hilarious  God he's awesome  He's gotta be the best  Why did he jump over the man  Instead of just elbowing him  Increases the impact  Of the elbow itself  Oh  Oh really  So while we have  You in here there  Sam  AJ Poopy Shits  Is there a back story  To AJ Poopy Shits  We learned about  The mad scientist  And Epstein  Well I mean  You met AJ before  He's just  He was looking for  A spot to fill on the show 
[03:15:00]  Right  And he realized that  He realized that  We had a lot of dead air  Go ahead yes  You guys don't have  An entertainment reporter  Yeah  And so AJ  Wanted to be the  Entertainment reporter  But wanted to  Make it so that  Guys could relate to it  Right  And he has a catchphrase  Yeah he does  What is it again  I think it's that  He likes  Chicks and tits  Uh huh  I think that's what  His catchphrase was  Chicks with what  Chicks that was  Tits  Chicks and their tits  And their tits  And their tits  Yeah 
[03:15:30]  Seems to be what he likes  Being you know  A man  Yeah  Bob  Yeah yeah  Bob just to let you know  Steve is forcing all  These guys to do  Characters and character  Development and backstories  For the characters  It's it's it's a whole  Thing that's going on  When aunt and I go home  At 1101  Yeah  He's  Steve the master  The master uh character  Developing guy  Yeah he's  He's the guy that  SNL goes to  To help out with the show  Yeah he's forcing all  These guys to come up  With characters  And there's a few more  In development that are  Coming to the show  But we have AJ 
[03:16:00]  Poopy shits uh  Presenting his  O&A entertainment update  You want to listen to this  Yeah this would be great  Alright  Hey what's up y'all  I'm AJ Poopy shits  And this is the  O&A entertainment update  The place where I let  You guys know  What Hollywood's  Hottish chicks are doing  With their tits  Hollywood bloggers  Are reporting that  Hero's hotties  Hayden Penitierre  And Milo  Whatever his name is  Are officially dating  Apparently  They've been dating  For a while  Which is sweet  Because Milo's got  A really great body 
[03:16:30]  So he's probably  Gotten a chance  To use it  To turn Hayden on  And I'd love  To be in that position  Just to get a look  At those tits  Moving on  Rock couple  Gavin Rosdale  And Gwen Stefani  Were recently seen  Out and about  With their baby son  In New York  I'll bet Gwen  Uses her tits  To breastfeed  Which is great  For Gavin  Because that means  That he gets to watch  Gwen's totally  Stylish rack  In action  Which makes me jealous  And finally  All sorts of trouble 
[03:17:00]  Is happening  With the Spears family  Of course  Jamie Lynn is pregnant  Which is cool  Because there's nothing  Hotter than a sexually  Active female  And as far as  Britney goes  People are saying  That she may be  Mentally ill  That sucks  Because she's going  To be impossible  To deal with  And her makeup  Has been atrocious lately  But regardless  I'd still hook up  With her in a second  As long as those  Great tits of hers  Were hanging off  That banging body  And that's today's  O&A Entertainment Update  I'm AJ Poopyshitz

[03:21:30]  Like any other guy  Sure  Sure  Yeah  What's up Bob  You like tits  I love tits  What do you like about tits  Oh just like the way they feel  And how they look and stuff  And that they produce milk  Everything about them  Is just  Like tits that milk comes out of  Well I mean  Milk can come out of any tits really  As long as it's a female  And that's what I like  Would you like big tits or little tits  With tits bigger is always better 
[03:22:00]  You don't like little tits  Little titties  Well I like little tits too  But big tits is  I would say my preference  Really  I would say so  Like ones that droop  Or fake titties  You like fake tits  I like very nice and perky tits  That are big  Really  On females  What else do you like about chicks  Oh I like  I like  A lot of chicks have better style than guys  And I will say that I do notice that  Because the way it shows off their tits  I'm saying  Like they have low cut shirts  And 
[03:22:30]  That's sort of what I like  The way that they can show off their tits  With their shirts  Shirts  Shirts  Tits  Shirts  You don't  So have you ever been  Have you ever done a threesome  Totally  With two chicks  Yeah  No  I bet  No no no  I mean like you  A guy  That's kind of gay for me  What  Two guys and a chick  Because you'd have to be in there  With another guy  And he'd be doing all that stuff  I'm not into that  What stuff  You know  The stuff like 
[03:23:00]  With guys  With their  Things  I'm just  That's not my  I don't even think about it  To tell you the truth  No  You've never thought about a guy  Never  Not like that  I'm saying  Like a penis  Ugh no  I don't think about penises whatsoever  He doesn't even want to say it  But if you did  Would you prefer a larger or smaller one  You mean if I was a chick or something  Yeah  I guess  Probably larger  But that's  I would never thought about it  But larger I would say  If you're a chick  You prefer larger  I would say  If you're a chick  Do you prefer  Cut or uncut  Like a  If I was a chick 
[03:23:30]  I've never thought about this before  But definitely cut  But I  That's just something  I'm sort of guessing at here  Do you ever been with a  You like black  White  Race  Do you have a race choice  Oh I am totally colorblind  When it comes to chicks  I mean  But if you were a chick  What color guy  Do you think you'd like  Oh I probably prefer like  A black guy  I guess  If I'm saying  If I was a chick  Just because  They tend to have  You know  More rhythm  And better style 
[03:24:00]  Cut black guy  With a big dick  If  That was  The situation for me  As a chick  But I've never thought about it  So my decision could change  That's just something  I'm guessing at  Well now  If you were a chick  Sure  Would you  Like would you  Swallow  I mean  I  Never thought about it  But if I was gonna  Commit to doing it  Like you know  A chick would  Then  Of course I would 
[03:24:30]  But that's something  You know  I've never thought about it before  So  Yeah  I don't know for sure  Do you think if you were a chick  Just curious  What do you think you'd say  To a cut black guy  With a big dick  As he was  Fucking  Just you know  Just like  I don't know  Off the cuff  This is sort of hard for me  To even think about doing  But I'd probably be like  I had no idea  They got that big  And uh  I can't wait to see  How that feels  Or something like that  I don't know for sure  But no  As he  I think the question was  As 
[03:25:00]  If you were a chick  Yeah  As he's fucking your asshole  Right  What would you be saying  I'd be saying  I guess  I would probably  Insist on calling him daddy  Probably  I don't know for sure  And probably just  Asking him to give me more  And probably if I'd been  Like a bad  Uh girl  Oh girl  Yeah  Like if I'd say  Um  You know  AJ's been a bad girl  Have you ever had a dick  That hurt when it went inside  Yeah  Well I mean  I've never had one 
[03:25:30]  But you could  Definitely think that  One could  Or like a chick might have  A chick  One time I was with a chick  And she was like  Jeez  AJ  You're so big  And good at doing it with me  That that hurt  But in a good way  And I was like  Whatever  I'm  I'm done having sex with you  So I'm done talking to you  Oh yeah  That's like  What a man's man would say  Right  Yeah totally  It's like  If you were a chick  Would you have nice tits  I would hope so  Yeah  But I mean  You know  All tits are nice 
[03:26:00]  They're just so great  Because they aren't  You know  Female  Do you work out  You go to a gym  Like a gym  You have a gym right  Yeah I go to the gym all the time  Do you like the steam room  Yeah I mean  Nothing better after a good workout  Than a good steam  What do you wear in the steam room  What do you wear  Just like a towel or whatever  Naked though  Underneath the towel  Sure  I mean  I'm not gonna  You know  Wear my underpants  Oh god  So when you go in the steam room  What if there's other guys  Naked around you  Does that bug you  Oh I don't  I've never even noticed  Cause I'll just like  Close my eyes 
[03:26:30]  Or stare at the ceiling  Or the floor  Really  Do you ever get hard  In the steam room  Well  No totally not  Because  Why would I  It's just guys  Let's say you did  I was thinking about chicks  Yeah you're a chick  Oh like if I was in the steam room  Thinking about chicks  Yeah what would you do  What would you do  What would your fantasy be  If you're a girl  You go into the guy's theater  At the New York sports club  It's around 1230 at night  It's over 24 hours  You sound a little too informed  About this  Wow  Question slash  Memories  Yeah 
[03:27:00]  That was the whole gimmick  I was going for  Okay  And scene  Sure  And  And  And  So what would you  Like  What would you be  Your fantasy  Like if I was just  Sitting in the steam room  And a girl walked in  No you're a girl  Okay  And you go into the steam room  And there's two guys  Naked next to you  They're naked  But they're not really  Doing anything  You're in the middle of them  What would you be  Your fantasy  Right then and there  Probably like  If I was the girl  You're saying  And these were the two guys  Probably like 
[03:27:30]  If they asked  If that towel  Is really necessary  And I'd be like  Well  Do you want to  Take it off  And then they would  Probably fight over  Who gets to take it off  And then I would  Probably grab their two  On each side  Right  You know what I mean  Like skiing  Just like they're  You know  They're things  I get it  I don't even  Just say you're a girl  You just say  Oh they're two cocks  But that says a girl  Like a girl would say that  Because like  How would she say it?  Like if she just  Grabbed two 
[03:28:00]  Great massive cocks  How would you say it to the guys  If you were a girl?  If I was a girl?  Yeah and you were going  To grab those  I'd be like  Let me see those things boys  What would you call them?  Cocks  How?  Cocks  Say it again  Cocks  So you  So you  The two guys are there  And they're just standing there  And they're waiting for you  To say what you want  What would you say to them?  I'd say  Take my towel off  So I can grab your cocks  And then what would you do?  Grab their cocks  And then what would you do? 
[03:28:30]  Dude  Bob  This is starting to get  Really sort of  Uncomfortable for me  I'm just asking  You're a girl  You're a girl  I've never even thought  I mean  Just what would you do  At that point?  So I grab their cocks  I don't know  I guess I would  Kneel down  Like maybe I'd  Get on all fours  Or something  And hope that one  Took me from the back  And one from the front  I guess  I'm saying  You know  Figures  That's probably  I don't know how  This is all done  Because I've only been  In situations where 
[03:29:00]  It's one guy  And just me  And everyone else is chicks  If it's sexual  So I'm not sure  But that's probably  How I would assume  If you were a chick  Do you think  Do you think  You'd want your mouth  Fucked  To your regurgitated reflex  If I was the chick?  Yeah  Yeah I mean  I'd probably want to  Spit up afterwards  Ugh  Jesus  Spit up  Yeah  I mean like  As far as chicks go  You want to  You know  Tell the fellas 
[03:29:30]  To put her on  If I'm a chick  Right  I would let the fellas  Know I want to be  On the rotisserie tonight  I'm saying  But that's just  Something that a chick  Would say  If you were a chick  Would you like  Lick the side  Of a guy's  Face  And just take that  Like that  Five o'clock shadow  On your tongue  Like a  Like a knife sharpener  If I was a chick  Yeah  Yeah definitely  You like that?  Yeah  I mean  Well no I don't  As a chick  But as a chick  Probably  You like that 
[03:30:00]  Five o'clock shadow?  Yeah I mean  If you're gonna  Be with a guy  Which I wouldn't be  Because it's not my thing  But uh  You have to have a guy  Who looks like a guy  Right  Somebody who's not quite  Clean shaven  Who's a bit  You know  Gruff  Gruff  Gruff  Like a man's man  A man's man  Like you  Like me  Exactly  Because I would assume  That a girl likes a man's man  Because chicks  Like me  You're a man's man  I try to be  And what makes you a man's man? 
[03:30:30]  What do you like about women?  Tits  I mean just  Getting to see a hot chick  Walking around with her tits  And then  Probably just using some smooth lines  To get  Like what?  What's a smooth line?  Just being like  I don't know any  I don't know  I'll probably  You know  Go up to a chick  And be like  Are your legs tired?  Because  Um  You were walking through my dreams  Or something like that  Wait a minute  What?  Right?  I mean  Like pretend Norton's a girl 
[03:31:00]  And what would you say to her?  What would you say to her?  Like have a little  Do a little scene  Like you're at a bar  So walk up to Norton  Something like  Just walk up to Norton  Do the scene  Okay  So what's up?  Hi  Do you come here often?  Not for the first time  Oh that's  That's cool  You know  You know  You look good in those pants  Thank you  But I bet they'd look  Even better on my floor  Out  Off of you  Do you know  Like something like that  And then the chick  Can I try it again 
[03:31:30]  Starts to get into it  That's good  Okay thank you  Like a few other angles  Like alright pretend right now  That you're in a  You're in a bar in Chelsea  It's late night  And you see Norton there  And you walk up to him  And you say what?  I'd say  Um  You know that shirt's  Very becoming on you  Thank you  Hopefully I will be too  You know something like that  Becoming  That's very  Yeah that's a good line  It's something good with wordplay  So it's not totally like 
[03:32:00]  Oh my god vulgar  Right  But still like the chick is like  Oh I like where you're going with this  You know what's weird about this whole thing  We tape everything  Yeah  We videotape everything at the studio  And that's Sam's job  And for some reason  I don't know where Sam is  During this whole thing  Why  Why is it Travis on the camera?  Travis is uh  Taping  Where's Sam AJ?  I think Sam  He went into one of the other studios  He had to uh  Either record a promo  Or cut up like  Lines of the day  Ah  Sam's a queer isn't he AJ? 
[03:32:30]  I  I  Sam and me don't get along  I think he is a little sort of  He's not exactly a man's man  Like you  Exactly  How'd you meet him?  Well just through the show  I mean  I'm a big fan of this show  And so  I was trying to figure out  How can I  Get on the show  And you know  Get on the air  And cut the mic a little  And so I came in  And met Steve  How was that?  I mean I knew him from before  You knew Steve from before? 
[03:33:00]  Yes  Who did you meet Steve?  Well I met Steve while I was out  Where?  I don't know  It was some bar  Where?  It was right  Well  I saw him at a bar  I was like  Do you work out?  Right  And he was like  He was like all the time  And so I was like  Cause he  You know  He's a very muscular guy  So I was like  You know  What's your gym?  And so  I started going to his gym  Right  And he started  You know  Training me a little  Trying to tell me  What's some good techniques  Like what's the technique  He taught you?  Oh just like  The squat thrusts  And you know 
[03:33:30]  Stuff like that  And he showed me  How to like  Cause like  A chick likes  A well groomed guy  But still a manly guy  So he was like  Showing me how  He shaves his arms  To show off his tats  And stuff like that  And then he was like  You know  I work on this show  And I was like  I'm such a big fan  And he was like  Well why don't you come in  And we'll see if we can  Find a spot for you  Isn't it true  You guys talked about it  In the steam room?  He said  Well why don't you come  Into the steam room  And we'll discuss this  A little further  Yeah I was like  You know 
[03:34:00]  Do you have any more room  On the show  For like  I don't know  An entertainment correspondent  Or like  Anything like that  And he was like  Yeah sure  Are you done working out?  I was like yeah  He was like  Well let's talk about it  In the steam room  How long did the conversation  In the steam room last?  I don't know  It was probably  Like 45 minutes or so  45 minutes in a steam room?  Well yeah I mean  It's a long time  In a steam room  Well we were throwing  Back and forth ideas  Ideas?  Yeah  Really  Like what was one of the ideas?  Um  Like one was 
[03:34:30]  To do entertainment reporting  Um  And to talk about  Maybe  Some of the techniques  We have picking up chicks  That was some of the ideas  Alright well  So I mean  That's just wonderful  Yeah  That's I mean  That's we were just  Chicks  Were you naked in there?  Technically I guess  I didn't  I was  With a towel on  We had towels on  He had a towel on too?  Uh yeah  Yeah  Was he naked under the towel?  I have no idea  Because we had the towels on 
[03:35:00]  The whole time  Definitely  Oh okay  They didn't accidentally  Fall off at all  I mean not that I recall  Steve's  Steve has a bigger waist than me  Because he's so muscular  So it's  It's harder for him  To tie the towel around the waist  So it could have slipped  Oh  But I don't know for sure  Because  Because he's so hairy  That  Yeah  I don't  It would look like  He's still wearing  A dark towel  I really wasn't paying attention  At all like that  We were just sort of  Thinking creatively  Why would you?  Water couldn't penetrate his cock 
[03:35:30]  It's like the rainforest  What?  He has a canopy over his cock  He has a fucking petrified helmet  All right  It was actually insects  They had never discovered  Inside of his cock  Turn up AJ's music  So he can get out of here  AJ Poopy Shits everyone  And another  Hopefully entertainment report  Coming soon right?  You got it guys  Hey it was nice meeting you  You too Bob  All right there he goes  AJ Poopy Shits  Shoulders kind of move  All funny when he talks  Oh god  Sam 
[03:36:00]  What?  You missed AJ Poopy Shits  Thank god  Why?  What's the problem?  You like AJ Poopy Shits?  He entertained us for a while  Ah where the hell were you?  Yeah  I don't listen  I'm not going to stick around  AJ Poopy Shits is not  Like funny to me  I think he's hilarious  Really?  He's a great guy  No I don't like that  A homophobe  I think he's a bouncer  He sounds gay  Do you think he's gay?  Yeah  Like he sounds  Like he sounds like 
[03:36:30]  He's coming up for a lot  That's fighting words right there  So you think AJ's gay?  I think he is  Like me personally  Yeah from what I hear on the show  So he doesn't like chicks  And their tits  I don't think so  He says he does  Right  Yeah that's what we're  Trying to figure out  I mean I don't know  Steve has never told us  How he met AJ  Oh really?  Like he won't  Like their stories  Are very like  I know how they met  How?  He told us  They met in a bar in Chelsea  At a bar in Chelsea?  Yeah  That doesn't sound gay?  Well I  When you put it that way  I guess you're right  Yeah  And then they went out to the gym 
[03:37:00]  To work out together  And he taught them squat thrust  Squat thrust in the gym  That's what he said  They work out together  Yeah  And then they had a meeting  In the steam room  For 45 minutes  What?  45 minutes  45 minutes in the steam room  Yeah  That doesn't sound gay  Who spent 45 minutes  In the steam room?  We couldn't shake the guy though  You know  He answered every question  Perfectly  We couldn't shake him  Well  It's completely suspicious  Completely suspicious  Yeah  No I mean  Steve took a liking to him  And he's got his own little gig 
[03:37:30]  Exactly  Well why does Steve  Take a liking to him?  I don't know why  Sounds like a queer  Right  He's not that great  He's like  He doesn't have any  Inside information  When it comes to Hollywood  That's stuff that's been on  TMZ for weeks  Yeah  He's not even talking  About anything  I mean  Or maybe we decide  Not to play it  And then  Said ah  What the hell  Maybe that disc  Has been sitting around  For weeks  And we weren't  We weren't sure  If we should bury  That bit or not  Was that topical news 
[03:38:00]  At one point?  Yeah maybe a few weeks ago  Yeah okay  Well I mean  It's not  It's still  It's not like  I think AJ's stock  Rised a little bit today  I can't believe it  Rosed a little bit today  Sure  Alright thank you Sam  Thank you AJ  Wherever you are  Yes  Watch out dude  He's in the hallway  I don't know  He might have heard  What you just said about him  Yeah like he's gonna fight him too  He's an old man  He's an old man dude  I'll bet he is  Hey we got  Bob Kelly audio  From your Saturday show  Where he puked  And we also got  We were handed a disc  Before we left  Commercial radio today  Tom  Chiasano 
[03:38:30]  Oh yeah  The one that  Is a bore  And wears really awful ties  And has braces  At 60 years old  He has braces  He's very happy  With the Opie and Anthony show  But he thinks  We need to add more music  Or sounds of some sort  Yes yes  To pepper  Into  Whatever we're talking about  Right  So if we were talking about  An example was  Britney Spears  There should be a Britney Spears song  Like crazy or something  You know  Playing in the background  Just to  Just to what  Punch it up 
[03:39:00]  Or pump it up a little bit  Yeah  So  Tom  Has been telling us this  For a while  We're like  Hold on  Before the message  The words go crazy  They gotta play music  He's saying  He's saying to pepper the bits up  Not to play song  Oh no no no  Just underneath  Yeah underneath what we're doing  Or sounds of some sort  Right  So we're like  Yeah yeah yeah  And we continue doing our show  Because we don't really feel like  Listening to anybody  We've been successful  Without listening to people  So we're like  Yeah yeah yeah  So fuck everybody  Right  So then he has  Now taken it to the next level  He took what  A half hour of our show 
[03:39:30]  And he had Tim and the gang  Over there  And  Music and things  That could help  The bit  This is from yesterday  I'm not sure  Our recent show  Travis is in here  Travis the first example  Is what  Tim would have done  What does that mean  Well because originally  We were gonna play  Oh okay  You know the original  Alright we decided  We don't need to play  Yeah this is from yesterday's show  Alright  So you guys are talking about  The ratings in New York  Okay  And how  The Spanish station 
[03:40:00]  Is the only one that's beating you  Okay so when we did this  We just talked about the ratings  And talked about  Yeah  A Spanish station is beating us  That's it  So Tim took that  And added some sounds  To give us an example  Of how we could  Make the show better  Right  Right  Yeah  And Tom by the way  Forced Tim to do this  Tim thinks we're great  Tim doesn't think  We really need  Help like this  But he has to listen to Tom  So here you go  And we are number two  Nice  In the New York area 
[03:40:30]  Behind  A España station  Yeah behind  A España  Behind the Spanish bastards  Yeah  Who I hear get away with murder  Because it's  You know  A different language  Yeah  No one knows what they're saying  Every morning  But they know it's filthy  No one knows to report them  They know it's filthy  Yeah  Yeah  You don't know how to report them  You don't know how to report them  And the people that are listening to them  Don't care  See I took six years of Spanish  Growing up  Yeah  I've tuned in the channel  Yeah  I have no clue  No clue 
[03:41:00]  Because they're all the dirty words  You never learned in school  Right  Well because they  They teach you like  You know  Proper Spanish  Yeah  If there is such a thing  Not the dirty street Spanish  Yeah  That is actually being spoken  Okay  So  La Bamba  La Bamba  La Bamba would have been  Yeah  Muzak  Version of La Bamba  Now remember  When we did this yesterday  Did this yesterday  There was no music behind that  Yeah  Yeah  As it shouldn't have been  Right of course  And that  No the music like  Like punched it up 
[03:41:30]  Yeah  Well the next example is  It's written here  Constant music is absolutely necessary  What's that about?  Oh yeah  Listen for the smooth transition between songs  Okay  So remember  What you're about to hear  Constant music is absolutely necessary  Is a bit of our show from yesterday  Where we did it dry  There was nothing  No music  No sound effects  And if we followed Tom's advice  He would like it to sound more like this  Going to some of these neighborhoods  They'll openly laugh at you 
[03:42:00]  Yeah  It's like speaking proper English  Imagine walking around speaking proper English  No  Well that's what the Spanish thing is all about  You gotta learn that dirty Spanish  Is that like  That dirty gutter Spanish  Is the Spanish you learn in school  Like speaking like Shakespeare wrote  Yes that's what I'm getting at  Exactly  It's like that  Yes  Well that's silly  You need to learn the Spanish slang  You need how to get down and dirty with your Spanish  Tom is joking 
[03:42:30]  It sounds like you're on hold  Yeah  He couldn't be fucking serious  Dude he handed all of us this disc  This  This was his project the last few days  This fucking sucks  It sounds so wacky  It sounds wacky  And  Zoo-like  And um  It's actually worse than zoo  It's distracting  It's worse than that  Yeah it's distracting from what you're just saying  That's what we try to  We try to impress upon them  Sometimes they're right  And you know like  Maybe the Britney song  We talk about Britney 
[03:43:00]  Yeah yeah  There's something like that  But like  I remember one of the examples was  When we talked to  When we had the  The boiled meat barbecue  Uh huh  Whenever somebody said  Gooey duck  We should have had a duck quacking  Really?  I thought  That's funny  Because it would have added  To the bit  Yeah layers  Sure  I'd have gone with the gooey part  And just had a clip from Slap Happy  Exactly  Gooey duck  Well the next example 
[03:43:30]  Just a few more here  Uh  Travis typed out  Did somebody say tools?  Oh yeah  This is during  This is during a Home Depot discussion  About uh  About how ratings  Um  Oh no  Do you remember this?  Yeah but  Okay  Now I know  Did somebody say tools?  By the way  If there's fucking  If there's fucking  Buzzsaw sounds  And tool sounds  I'm gonna fucking  Set the studio on fire  And these people  And I'll just say it this way 
[03:44:00]  And these people wonder  Why we don't listen to anybody  Because no one has  Ever given us anything  Worth listening to  I gotta hear it  I gotta hear it  It's like um  It's like the tool section  In Home Depot  What?  You know you look around  The tool section  Get the fuck out of here  This is a joke  Stop it  Stop it  Because like  It's almost like  Alright  I'm gonna play the part  Like Anthony brings  His toolbox to work now  Yes  In between bits 
[03:44:30]  He's hammering  And power drilling  And during the bits  Whatever  This is the listener  According to Tom  Can you play  Just play that again  Okay  It's like um  It's like the tool section  In Home Depot  What would that sound like?  You know you look around  The tool section  In Home Depot  Yeah  Their goal  Isn't to get a bunch  Of women in there  To buy some  Ryobi drills  Or something  But they don't mind  A dumb broad  Going in  Occasionally  She goes in  Pick something up  Pick up a power tool  Or something  Of course  Occasionally she's going in there  And picking something up  But for the most part 
[03:45:00]  For her pleasure  A bunch of guys  For her pleasure  A power drill  For her pleasure  Right  But for the most part  It's a bunch of guys  Going in there  That's what they expect  That's what they're gunning for  Advertising for  Right  And that's what they get  How about this  That's good  Oh my  By the way  I would like us  To show Tom  That we're on the same team  To take one of our bits  Just gonna  And put sounds  Yeah  I'm sure he would appreciate  But um  Who's  We should do this  Who's the boss over there? 
[03:45:30]  Oh uh  Tom  I like that sound  That goes  Yeah  Tom Chiasano  And what does he always wear?  Uh  A tie  Well  The next  What did Travis write  For this one?  More tornado sounds  Please  You guys are talking about  Your latest animation  On iTunes

[03:50:30]  Got it  Actually I'm a little frightened  They're calling it  A stunning  New Hampshire victory  Yeah but look at what she had to do  In order to win  Because I look at the cover  Of the New York Post  Alright so  That music plays through the whole thing  You know  Tom is terrific  And then finally this one  More music added  Just for the hell of that  Okay  Hell of it  Because basically what he's saying  Is that we're not interesting enough  Sure of course  We're just talking  We need like bells and whistles  Right  And I don't really give a crap
