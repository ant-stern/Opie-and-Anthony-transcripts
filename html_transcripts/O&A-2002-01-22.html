<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts acknowledging a foul-smelling garbage pail in the studio, blaming their own and the staff's lack of hygiene.  They then apologized for the previous Friday's show, citing a guest who "pimped" girls appearing on the show, leading to a physical altercation between the guest and staff member Steve. The conversation transitioned to Martin Luther King Jr. Day, with Steve humorously recounting his experience at a Baptist church service.  The hosts speculated about September 11th becoming a national holiday, before Jimmy Norton chimed in about his successful weekend gigs despite bad weather.  The discussion then turned to the controversial Patriots-Raiders football game, specifically a disputed fumble call, and a highly vulgar and offensive tirade against sports columnist Phil Mushnick for his negative commentary and criticism of the intoxicated fans. This segment included numerous listener calls detailing their own experiences at the game, frequently involving heavy drinking. The death of a lifelong Patriots fan at the game was also mentioned.  A story about Opie and Anthony missing an NHL All-Star game due to excessive drinking in a limo was recounted. The hosts also shared their harsh, vulgar, and offensive opinions on John Walker, a U.S. citizen who fought for the Taliban, and the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.

The show moved to a "naughty nighty" contest, with listener feedback and a prank call segment where they impersonated a family calling a funeral home to delay their father's burial until after the Super Bowl.  More listener calls about the football game followed.  The "Stalker Patty Cribs" segment was introduced, revealing Patty's unusual upbringing—being abandoned as a baby on a diner counter.  Vulgar descriptions of Stalker Patty's mother's lifestyle and situation were included.  The segment also involved attempts to locate Patty's half-sister, Valerie Brooks, through calls to police and private investigators.  A discussion about underwear preferences and sizes, featuring an editor from *Details* magazine, unexpectedly arose. This segment continued with several callers participating, offering information and contributing to the often crude and sexually suggestive humor.  Two young women in lingerie participated in the "Naughty Nighty" contest, with photos planned for the show's website.

The "Naughty Nighty" contest continued, focusing extensively on the physical attributes of contestant "Teen Melanie," whose pictures were shown and commented upon both live and online via the "stinky cam."  A significant portion was dedicated to a discussion of a Mike Tyson incident, including playing audio clips of Tyson’s erratic and offensive behavior after an alleged attack on Lennox Lewis.  The "Stalker Patty Cribs" segment continued, with the remote crew documenting Patty's cramped and squalid living conditions.  A "FU" call-in segment allowed listeners to express their anger towards various people or things.  Phone calls provided updates on the Naughty Nighty contest, the Tyson incident, and the Stalker Patty Cribs segment. The "Stalker Patty Cribs" segment showed Rick and Steve documenting Patty's messy apartment, finding a high school yearbook, a one-eyed doll (a voodoo doll of her mother), and other peculiar items.  They described the cramped living conditions and mentioned a "coffee clutch" and gang activity outside.  The Naughty Nighty contest continued, featuring Candy, who was interviewed live on air and whose photos were discussed in detail, along with Teen Melanie and Shannon, a "naughty nurse" from Cleveland participating remotely. The hosts gave instructions for remote participation in the contest. The segment utilized vulgar language and sexually suggestive remarks throughout.  The broadcast concluded with the introduction of a new show sweeper.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All right, we're not feeling that today.  There is a urine-like quality back here.  What's going on?  No, it's that garbage pail.  Is it?  Karen?  Someone's got to get that out of here.  Don't smell.  Smell it.  Smell the garbage pail.  Right?  Because I think that garbage pail used to be in our office, 
[00:00:30]  and I remember smelling that smell in the office.  The studio smells like this.  You know why?  Because there's a bunch of guys that work around here,  and we don't care.  We just pour whatever we need to pour out  right into the garbage pail without a bag in it.  And after a while, it starts stinking.  Without a bag?  You know how much sour milk is in there?  Or remnants of sour milk?  Okay.  Remnants of beer.  And Chinese food.  Maybe every so often they can be hosed out. 
[00:01:00]  You know what I mean?  Where are you going to find a hose?  I don't know.  Hey, man, we got some...  The world needs garbage pail hoses, too, you know.  Okay, Pookie.  We have so much to do.  Let's just start by saying...  Yeah.  We want to apologize for Friday's show.  My favoritest sound. 
[00:01:30]  I don't even remember being here Friday.  Yeah.  Did we have a good show?  No.  My recollection was that little Jimmy Norton over there  completely wrecked the whole flow of the Opie and Anthony show on Friday.  But I turned out to be correct.  No, it sucked.  Friday's show sucked.  Not one of the worst ever.  It was fun for us.  Maybe fun for some people that were able to get a glimpse on the stinky cam.  But it sucked.  Not one of the worst ever that we've done, but really bad.  It was... 
[00:02:00]  Because we do a lot of things where we have girls come in and do various things in the studio.  The difference is, it's very inclusive to the audience.  We put it out there.  Put it on the webcams.  Or just...  There's a vivid description, as much as we can get away with, of what's going on.  And it's fun.  It sucked Friday.  There were girls in here.  There was really no description of what they were doing,  because they weren't really doing much.  And it was like pulling teeth.  With some a-hole guy that was pimping these girls. 
[00:02:30]  Steve got in a little brawl with him.  That was my favorite part of the show.  How Steve bodily threw the guy out.  Yeah.  You don't want to mess with Steve ever.  I write for Foundry Music.  Not anymore.  He goes, you say that one more time, I'm going to punch you in the face.  And then, like, five minutes later, he's like, well, you know, I...  And he looks over at Steve.  He's ready to say that. 
[00:03:00]  Say what?  Go ahead.  Say what?  One more time, mother effer.  I dare you.  I double dare you.  You know what Steve's wallet says on it?  Bad mother effer.  It's the one that says bad mother effer.  So, we're back.  Yeah.  We apologize for Friday's mess.  It happens from time to time when you're freewheeling like we do.  Right.  When we shoot from the hip and just go with the flow.  Exactly.  Sometimes there's no flow.  Sometimes the planets aren't aligned. 
[00:03:30]  No.  No.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hello.  Did you have a good day off yesterday?  Yes.  Yeah, we had our show, Our Respect, to Martin Luther King.  Was that what yesterday's holiday was?  Yeah.  Oh.  Pretty good, Reverend Dr. Astronaut Martin Luther King.  Shut up.  I was at a Baptist church singing.  I'm going to hear it.  Singing the praises of the Lord.  I felt like I was in a Klumps movie.  Did you?  Did you go to one of those Baptist churches? 
[00:04:00]  Hey, man.  Sing.  If you're going to show your love for Martin Luther King, you've got to do it the right  way.  Oh, yeah.  Got to go to the Baptist church and then built out a few tunes.  Go all crazy.  With the fat black lady.  Nice.  And the fan.  All right, boys.  Got the fan in your hand.  All right, Steve.  It was all hot in there.  All hot.  Yeah, that was kind of nice.  We've never taken that holiday.  We've never been offered it.  It's going to get to the point where we're not going to be working anymore.  They're adding holidays.  Holiday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Well, yeah.  What are you going to do?  Didn't they add September 11th at this point?  Or are they going to?  No, I'm sure they won't.  They won't?  No, anytime soon.  Doesn't it take a while to get a holiday going?  I will bet you money this coming September 11th.  Do you think it's going to be a holiday?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I think we'll be on high alert.  They've already started discussing.  Really?  To make it a national holiday.  Yeah.  Why would you want to make that a holiday?  Like Pearl Harbor Day, it's recognized, but it's not a day off or anything. 
[00:05:00]  December 7th, I think it's kind of silly.  Yeah.  By the time we're old, we're not going to have to work anymore.  There's going to be too many holidays.  365 days off.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  That's how it should be anyway.  Jim, how was your gigs over the weekend, my friend?  Excellent.  Thank you.  Five sold-out shows, and I thank the people for coming out in the snow on Saturday.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was awful weather, of course.  The big storm we had.  The big storm that moved across our area.  It's all gone now.  What do we have, like two inches? 
[00:05:30]  It was ridiculous.  I've got more than that in Jersey.  There's probably about four and a half, five inches in Jersey.  Oh, stop it.  I'm telling you.  It was not.  Wouldn't make that up.  Three inches at most.  Maybe.  You're exaggerating.  We're a bunch of pussies in the New York area.  I'm so glad we're syndicated to places like, you know, Boston, and especially like Buffalo.  Buffalo.  Cleveland.  Mm-hmm.  Those people know what a real storm is all about.  Those nor'easters.  The nor'easter.  In Massachusetts.  It's the perfect storm.  Yeah, a good nor'easter.  It was snowing pretty good at Foxborough. 
[00:06:00]  Go, Pat!  That's some New England football there, my friend.  All right, let me get it out of the way.  Everyone's discussing it for like the last three or four days.  Well, let me tell you something, Megan.  Simple as this.  The umps made the right call according to the rule book.  The Vols out of Vols, Megan.  Stupid rule, but they made the right call.  End of story.  Stop discussing it.  Pats move on.  And who predicted that the Pats would beat the Raiders?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  You did?  Thank you.  That just goes to show you. 
[00:06:30]  Some little monkey wrench in the works made it so they could pull it off.  Bob acknowledging the fact of Boston, congrats to Ope.  I don't know if you remember this, but early last week you picked the Pats to beat Oakland.  This is the first time that I can recall that you picked a winner.  They weren't supposed to win.  That's why.  Not true.  Something happened.  You effed with fate.  Something got mixed up in the works there.  That was supposed to be a fumble.  No, according to the rule book, no.  It's a stupid rule, and they'll probably change in the offseason.  Made the right call. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Brady was unbelievable, though.  Well, why can't the Jets have a quarterback like Brady?  Maybe the Pats want to give up Brady.  You think so?  Throw us a bone here in New York.  Guy throws for almost 300.  Take Vinny?  He almost, he throws for almost 300 yards, and pretty much, well, I was going to say  a blizzard.  Heavy snow.  Yeah.  That was great to watch, though.  The snow like that, just getting all effed up and cold, and boom.  Whenever they'd hit the ground, the snow would go flying.  Have you ever been to one of those games?  Oh, when I was a kid. 
[00:07:30]  I think when the Jets were playing at Shea.  I was fortunate enough to go to a bunch of those games when I was living in Buffalo.  They are so much, everyone in the stadium is just completely hammered.  Because you get it in the right frame of mind, you know it's going to snow all day, and you  just prepare, you get like five or six layers on, you get all sorts of flasks on your body,  and you drink until you can barely stand, and you enjoy the weather and the game.  And it's great, because you're just sitting there, packed in with everyone else, and you're  drinking, and you're just hammered. 
[00:08:00]  That's why you got to drink and stuff, because if you're not a little buzz, you get really  annoyed in that situation, because of the extra layers you're wearing, you're sitting  pretty much on the other guy's lap.  I mean, there's no room in between people.  When you get up to take a leak or something, and you come back, you sit in your seat, you  go like, you slide between them, and you're locked in.  Right.  Because everybody's bundled up.  Everyone looks like the kid from Christmas Story, all bundled up and can't move.  You see Phil Mushnick's column there, in the post, I think it was yesterday, is there? 
[00:08:30]  Here in New York?  Yeah.  What's his problem now?  Well, this guy's a big huge bag.  We got to explain for the other cities.  Phil Mushnick, he writes his sports column for the New York Post.  The guy is miserable.  The guy pretty much hates sports, so I don't know why he writes about it at this point.  Most of the sports columnists, they'll bring up good points and stuff, but you can tell  they're true sports fans.  This guy doesn't like anything about any team or any sport.  So why is he writing at this point?  And the, well, at least, I must say, at least Phil went a whole other direction with this 
[00:09:00]  than the other writers did.  A lot of the writers talking about the call, the fumble forward pass call.  Phil's talking about how the people were too drunk to drive home from Foxborough.  He said, at game's end, close to midnight, 60,000 people, by special invitation of the NFL,  got in their cars and drove, or tried to drive. 
[00:09:30]  He's just trying to be different.  That's all.  He's a simpering little pussy boy.  Their good and welfare was put at immediate and sustained risk because the league chose  to place money, a TV partner, over common decency.  What?  So what is he trying to say?  Because it was a night game on a Saturday night that people are drinking more?  A game that should have been played in the relative and more sensible climb of early afternoon.  When was the last time this guy went to a football game in the afternoon?  It doesn't matter if it's afternoon. 
[00:10:00]  It doesn't matter if it's Monday.  It doesn't matter if it's Sunday night.  How many people like to drink at their football games?  It says it was played at the predictably worst time.  How do you predict that it was going to be a little snowstorm?  Snowstorm definitely makes people drink more, but you don't know that.  You don't know it's going to be heavy snows.  And just as the NFL abandoned its integrity to make a primetime playoff game,  the game lacked integrity.  And then he starts bashing the game.  But then the...  How could you bash that game?  It was a great game. 
[00:10:30]  Whether you're a Pats fan, a Raiders fan, or not even a football fan,  you're taking a peek at that game.  It looked like so much fun, right?  Yeah.  Saturday's telecast also found Phil Simms suddenly hollering,  Whoa!  That was hilarious!  I just got hit with a snowball.  Ben picked up on that, too.  You're watching the game, and all of a sudden you hear,  Hey, what are you up?  Exactly like that.  Hey, what are you up?  And then he goes to, what's his partner there?  He goes, I just got hit by a snowball, and I see the guy that did it.  I see the guy that threw it. 
[00:11:00]  Well, what the hell is he going to do?  He's trying to say it to Greg Gumbel, and they're trying to play it off.  It's not that big deal, but that's a tough throw to throw a snowball.  All the way up to where they're doing the commentary?  The fourth quarter also brought the sound of snowballs smacking against the broadcast booth.  Inexcusable behavior, of course.  Oh, shut up, Phil.  Phil Mush.  This seems like a guy that never had a minute of fun in his life,  and he's letting everyone know it now.  No girls.  Nothing.  A little fat neck and a bad beard. 
[00:11:30]  Phil.  I've never read anything positive in this column.  He sucks!  It's all, he just, he's miserable, and he hates sports.  So go write about something else.  He goes the other direction on purpose.  Like, he wants people to, boy, that Mushnik really gets to the bottom of things.  He's just a jizz bag.  How could you say that, you know, a game played in a snowstorm is not fun to watch?  Because he stinks, that's how.  CBS on Saturday began its coverage by encouraging those dressed for excess to demonstrate for the cameras.  Many of these miscreants held containers filled with booze. 
[00:12:00]  Or was that apple juice?  That's great.  And Sims might want to take it up at the NFL,  which begged for trouble by scheduling a Saturday night game in a venue that is well-known,  grows stupider by the hour.  The Fox party gets stupider by the hour.  The forecast for this game was cold and drunk.  Even before snow was predicted.  Cold and drunk. 
[00:12:30]  By midnight, the drunk and sober alike would be in their snow-covered cars driving on dark snow-covered roads.  Yeah, at about a mile an hour, you idiot.  Have you ever tried to leave up there after a game?  It's probably safer to have a bunch of people leaving a football game in a snowstorm than it is on a dry, clear evening.  You can't go that fast without wiping out, and you might get into an accident, but a fatal accident?  Probably hard to do. 
[00:13:00]  Plus, I think there's responsibility as far as the Pats go.  I'm assuming that they stop serving drinks.  Oh, no.  Foxborough?  Do they?  I think that's...  Maybe someone could help us out, but that's pretty...  I don't know.  There's probably some inside nepotism money deal that keeps them selling it.  But that's pretty much a rule.  No one's even playing right now.  I think you can go to Foxborough and pick up a beer now.  Pretty much a rule, though.  They cut off the booze at a certain time, right?  And Phil is condemning everybody that was at the game. 
[00:13:30]  Every 60,000 people that were there.  Every single one of them was drunk and had their own car there.  Phil.  Phil, lighten up, you dick.  That Phil really gets to the brass tacks, doesn't he?  It's right down to brass tacks.  That Mushnick really gets it.  Get Mushnick in here.  I want to shake his hand.  Yeah, thanks, Phil, for standing up.  I watched every second of that game, and mostly because it was, you know, snowing like it was.  It was a great game.  The field goal there. 
[00:14:00]  Woo!  And what's the story with the guy that died at Foxborough Stadium?  Oh, yeah.  Some guy, lifelong Pats fan.  I think he was 68, something like that.  They were with his family, his sons.  And they had a heart attack right after they won.  Everyone's jumping up, going crazy.  And his sons are all jumping around and stuff.  Horrible thing.  They look over, and he's slumped in his chair.  He's dead.  But then even his sons are like, you know, hey, he's a Pats fan for life.  He went out watching the game. 
[00:14:30]  The last, you know, last game the Pats are going to play at Foxborough.  So I guess they were kind of, you know, if he had to go, what the hell is one way?  This article's actually wrong.  It should be 59,999 people.  Right, exactly.  I don't think he was driving home that night.  Yeah, Foxborough, what?  They got the new place opening up next year.  Yep.  I'm sure that'll be completely different.  There won't be a bunch of drunks in there.  I got to say, I don't agree with Phil with the way he puts it in this column. 
[00:15:00]  But I will say, if you're up in Boston and you're at a sporting event, you're drinking.  You are drinking, Boston.  I know.  Me and Opie didn't even get to a goddamn hockey game one night.  Hockey game?  It was a hockey game.  It was the All-Star game.  It was the NHL All-Star game.  Yeah, right when the Fleet Center opened up, right?  Right.  And it was some radio giveaway where a couple of listeners got to get tickets and sit with Opie and Anthony at the All-Star game. 
[00:15:30]  We never made it in.  We drank ourselves stupid in the limo.  We drank ourselves sick.  Yeah.  And then we went to the bar at the Fleet Center.  We hung out with the three goalies from the brothers from Flapshot, the Hanson brothers.  Right.  We hung out with the actual Hanson brothers.  We thought that at the time was much more interesting than going to the NHL All-Star game.  We lost it.  We stink.  We had like the best seats in the house, too.  I think it was through Budweiser. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  We blew off our listeners.  We had a great time with them.  We were like, ah, you guys go to the game and tell us how it is.  And then Ant and I took our tickets and scalped them.  We got so drunk, we scalped our tickets drunk outside of the Fleet Center.  The Hanson musicians?  No, the Hanson brothers.  Hanson brothers from Slapshot.  One of the greatest movies ever made.  You dare to dream about getting the Hanson musicians there.  You've never seen Slapshot.  I have, but it's been many years.  Paul Newman.  Oh, yeah, good.  Yeah, it's been a long time.  It's a movie about hockey, right? 
[00:16:30]  Oh, you're acting like it came out this week.  It was like, what, 78?  Everyone knows who the Hanson...  You would think if we were talking about a hockey game and say Hanson brothers, you're  thinking Hanson?  Dude, you're not a guy.  Um, bop, bop, bop.  You're not a guy if you don't watch Slapshot every once in a while.  What, did you say one and done?  No, I just had to...  The loonaut's got to be as pink as freshly chewed hubba-bubba.  So.  So, end of story.  Right.  Umps made the right decision there with that play. 
[00:17:00]  The rule's stupid.  They'll change that rule.  They're still discussing it on the all-sports station here in New York.  I don't know that, Maggie.  I reviewed the rules and the tape, and I can't see how this wasn't...  How long can you, you know, talk about one play?  Mm-hmm.  On your radio show.  They're up to, like, six straight hours.  Six hours talking about the play.  This is a play that is going to stick in the floor of Oakland till next year. 
[00:17:30]  And that's right, Michael.  Mike from Gloucester.  Gloucester!  He just writes, pats, pats, pats a million times, and then he goes, one win away from your  crew being minus one guy who said he would jump in front of a bus if they went to the Super  Bowl.  Well, Stinky did indeed say he would kill himself if the pats made it to the ball.  Would kill himself.  Stinky!  I don't get it. 
[00:18:00]  Stinky.  I will be alive and well in two weeks.  Not with Brady playing how he's playing.  Ah, whatever.  Whatever.  Whatever.  The Steelers, best defense.  Look what they did to the Ravens.  Know what our worst nightmare is?  That we end up with...  Stinky Pestaverde?  We end up...  Well, we got that one.  Good one.  We end up with Bledsoe, though.  No way.  We're never having him.  They're trading him.  They're trading him.  You watch.  The pats will never trade him to the Jets.  They're going to trade him to somebody.  No way.  We got Pennington coming up.  Oh, Christ. 
[00:18:30]  All right.  Kill yourself.  Two weeks.  Here's Paul checking in, saying, my buddy Sully, of course, my buddy Sully had to leave  the game during the third quarter because he was too S-faced to stand.  He passed out in the car, woke up at 4 a.m., and we had to tell him what happened.  Go Pats.  There you go, Phil.  He didn't drive home.  He just got frostbite in his car out in the parking lot of Foxborough.  My buddy Sully.  Sully, you are faced. 
[00:19:00]  Why didn't they shut him off?  Someone should have shut you off, Sully.  I didn't know Jimmy Fallon was a Pats fan.  Sully.  Isn't that great?  I love it.  I love the fans.  It comes from years of heartbreak, man.  It absolutely comes from years of heartbreak.  There's hardcore fans in every city, though.  Yeah.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, tell Phil we all had time to sober up waiting to get out of the damn parking lot  up there.  Two hours and 45 minutes to hit Route 1. 
[00:19:30]  Ah, to get out of the lot.  Yeah.  Phil.  Yeah, wonderful.  And they built a new stadium where?  Next to it.  Right next door.  Right next door.  Yeah.  Thanks, Kraft.  So it's going to be just as hard to, you know, leave the games.  Wasn't part of building a new stadium, wasn't part of the reasoning that it was such an  out-of-the-way kind of place and the road leading to it was that one two-lane road?  You've been reading the newspapers again.  Well, I don't understand why the men plopped it exactly where the old one is. 
[00:20:00]  Right.  So they could charge more for a ticket.  I guess.  I don't know.  All right, Mark.  All right.  Later.  Yeah, you ever been to a game at Foxborough, it is a pain in the ass to leave, man.  I try to take the overland route whenever I can, but the cops aren't too, uh, they don't  like that very much.  It's that or a concert, but you're easily an hour and a half getting out.  You have to either, you always have to leave early.  And you got the long drive back to Boston.  And there was times that they didn't have lights in the parking lot, so you couldn't  even find your car.  You'd go to the wrong car and it looked like it.  I've had it happen. 
[00:20:30]  You go, it'd be dark and it'd be like dirt.  Ben, I mean, you're one of Bushnick's 60,000.  Believe me.  You're one of those guys.  One of those guys.  What does Phil think, New York?  We don't drink at the games?  He's just condemning Foxborough's, the Pat fans there, for drinking and thinks it has  anything to do with the weather or the time?  I've been at matinee games at Shea where people are almost falling off of the mezzanine  levels because they're just hammered, snotted. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  Happens everywhere.  Hey, Mike, what's going on?  Opie.  Yeah.  If there was a question before, there is no more.  The jinx is over.  Yeah, my sports jinx is way over at this point.  Way over.  Way over.  Phil needs to come to Foxborough, I think.  All right, Mike, thank you.  I won't go there.  There are people having fun.  Yuck.  Phil.  Phil?  Phil Mushnick? 
[00:21:30]  I'm going to save our listeners a lot of trouble because I know some of you.  You flip around, see what else is going on on the radio.  All right.  All the sports stations in your city.  Talking about the play.  The play for six to eight hours.  We simplify things on this show.  They made the right call according to the rule book.  Stupid rule.  End of discussion.  Thank you.  Okay?  Right.  As far as John Walker goes.  Because maybe you'll go to a little talk show.  Oh, right.  Sure.  Maybe a talk show that talks politics and other things.  John Walker should be returned to his parents so his parents can bury him. 
[00:22:00]  End of discussion.  That's bad.  Don't want to discuss that anymore, right?  And as far as the bleeding hearts wanting to protect the Taliban prisoners.  The prisoners.  We should be treating them bad.  End of discussion.  Itching powder in the foreskin.  I want to know who it is.  I've heard these things that people are a little upset at their treatment at Guantanamo.  Who are these people? 
[00:22:30]  Who is saying this?  One of them is her.  I can't.  Who's her?  Helen Bamber of the British group Care of Victims of Torture.  Said the detainees will probably have panic attacks, mood changes, and terrible nightmares.  Is this twat for real?  They should have all that after we put bamboo shoots under their fingernails.  You know, you cannot even sell me on the fact that Americans don't take the best care of their prisoners ever. 
[00:23:00]  Are there some people on our side that might give them an extra kick or two?  Eh, maybe.  No worse than people get in prison.  But the fact that they're saying that.  No worse than what happened to Jim Norton and Rick when they got arrested for the voyeur back incident.  Yeah, to eat those goddamn bologna TB sandwiches.  You know, the handcuffs get a little tight.  They rough you up a bit. 
[00:23:30]  Dude, end of discussion.  Let the stupid political talk shows talk about it.  They should be treated bad.  John Walker should be sent back to his parents so they can bury him.  And the play should stand as is.  Good night.  She says the earmuffs and blackout goggles, some of the prisoners wore, constitute torture.  Sensory deprivation can have the effect of breaking people down because you're actually attacking someone's identity.  And challenging the notion of who they are. 
[00:24:00]  You know what's sensory deprivation, watching buildings fall down?  You know what kind of sensory overload that was?  We're just giving them the opposite.  Ask John McCain about if he would have preferred to have goggles and earmuffs on as opposed to being beaten until your shoulder pops out of your body.  Oh, my God.  Or being in a cage in the middle of a rice paddy with water up to his waist. 
[00:24:30]  These people are being treated better than what they came out of.  They were in caves shooting us.  And now they're getting fed.  You're discussing it.  You know something?  I understand.  The play, fine.  Walker, fine.  This I had to talk a little bit about.  Let's make things short and simple on this show.  Well, we'll call it like news for retards.  Instead of discussing it for hours, this is how it is.  Boom, move on.  To sum it all up, I hope Helen Bamber has a miscarriage while playing hopscotch. 
[00:25:00]  Oh.  That's what should happen to Helen Bamber.  How about this?  Room picked out.  Just talk about Steve Dunleavy's picture in the paper.  He should have stuck to the old one.  What happened to Steve?  Well, the old one had him with no hair.  You might remember Steve Dunleavy from...  Public Affair.  Current Affair.  Current Affair.  Current Affair.  Shroom.  He made his bones during the Joey Butterfuco debacle.  Oh, he looks a little older than that last picture.  I'd update my picture every month if I were any of these columnists. 
[00:25:30]  Hey, we found a really good little bit from the ONA archives.  Yeah.  And there's a lady, she hung up, unfortunately.  Everyone is going, can you believe Tyson?  ONA see Tyson today.  Tyson, Tyson, Tyson.  One lady goes, I will not go to work until you guys talk about Tyson.  I cannot wait to hear what you have to say about Tyson.  Tyson, if you haven't heard, stick around.  We're going to tell you what happened with Mike Tyson.  He's loose somewhere in the city right now.  No joke.  On the loose. 
[00:26:00]  We'll give you the details in just a bit.  But as we go to break, the poor guy, the father dying at Foxborough Stadium this weekend.  It reminded us of a little prank call we did when the Packers were in the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  Go Pack, go.  And we called the funeral home because our dad died.  Yeah.  It was his dream to see the pack in the bowl, the Packers in the bowl.  Check this out.  Do you know him?  Hello?  Yes, ma'am.  Okay. 
[00:26:30]  My name's Artie Milo.  Uh-huh.  And my father recently passed away.  Did your dad pass away, did you say?  Yes.  Yes, he did.  When was that?  I don't know.  Two, three days ago.  Okay.  Now, he wanted to watch the Super Bowl with his family.  Uh-huh.  And we just want to know if there's a way you can come over and, like, you know, temporarily, you know, prop him up in the big chair.  So when the family comes over, he'll be okay until after the Super Bowl and then we'll bury him?  No, we can't do that, Mr. Milo.  Oh, it was his one dream to watch the Packers in the Super Bowl. 
[00:27:00]  And we already painted his face green and gold.  No, but it would be, you mean, not get him until then?  Yeah, well, you could come over and maybe, you know, pump him with whatever you do and, you know, preserve him until after the bowl.  No, I'm afraid we just can't do it.  Why?  It was his dream, you know, to watch the Packers in the bowl.  Uh-huh.  And we've been holding on to him for a couple of days now.  He's been in the barn, but, you know, the coyotes have been a-nipping, and I don't think he's going to make it until Sunday. 
[00:27:30]  No, he died.  Who knows that he has died?  Hopefully, no one.  But we just want you to come over and, you know, prop him up in the chair and maybe open up his hand so we can put a beer in there.  And we can't do that.  We can't embalm anybody at home.  Embalm, that's the word.  And once they're embalmed, they can't be, you know, they can't be in a sitting position.  You know, it just kind of...  Well, he's been in a sitting position now, and he's getting kind of hard.  But if you could maybe do something and then lay him down later? 
[00:28:00]  No, I'm afraid we can't.  It might even be up to, you know, if you've got to break something, it's okay.  No, we don't do that.  It was his one lifetime dream.  You see the Pack in the bowl with his family, and we got the big screen TV and the chair for him, and he went up and died.  We will not do that.  But if your dad has died and if you really have not notified anybody, you do have to do that.  So you have to have the medical examiner's approval to take him away.  Okay, look, what if we put the coffin in the house and put the TV on the coffin? 
[00:28:30]  That way he'll be with the family.  Is there a law or something?  No, if he was embalmed and if he was, you know, able, you know, like if there's no problem as far as preserving him.  Right.  And could you put like a pack banner in his hand?  Because it was his dream to see the packs in the bowl.  We could probably do that.  You could put a pack...  Well, that's okay?  Mm-hmm.  I don't know if we could have a visitation, you know, in the house depending on how, you know, how well he preserved he was  and if we could get a casket into the house.  But once he's, you know, once he's embalmed, he is laying down. 
[00:29:00]  Right.  Okay, do you think that's like degrading if we put the cheesehead hat on him?  Do you want me to call the medical examiner for you?  Oh, no, that might not be a good idea.  Then we'd have to try to explain where his feet went.  Bye.  Rain Wreck Radio.  Like a bunch of people cheering on a race.  That's going to make a sweeper.  Oh, you're scum.  Anthony.  Slime.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots of instant feedback coming in. 
[00:29:30]  Anyone else noticing that a lot of other stations are starting to use instant feedback?  Ah, yeah.  Boy.  That's, you know, technology.  What are you going to do?  You can get to instant feedback through opieandanthony.com.  Eric from Jersey.  I learned today.  And early, what are we learning?  Yeah.  We usually don't do this, but it's a good one.  Alcoholics know when it's going to snow, but meteorologists don't.  And Patrick from Boston.  I was at the game on Saturday.  I was trashed out of my mind, and I'm 20. 
[00:30:00]  The best part of the game was watching people leave after the, quote, fumble, and then watching  them run back in after it was overturned.  That is always fun to watch.  Yeah, the people that leave, let's beat the rush and miss the most exciting part of the  game.  I rarely leave a sporting event early.  I'm a beat the rush guy when it's a blowout.  Well, I absolutely will leave.  You know, it's a blowout.  Screw it.  I would have left a Knick game yesterday.  Yeah.  We officially have the worst basketball team in the NBA here in New York. 
[00:30:30]  It doesn't matter what the record says.  We stink.  Yeah?  I don't pay attention, but that's the fault.  I guess a bunch of people at the garden yesterday were all chanting refund.  Oh, is that the chant?  That's what you want to hear when you're on the court.  Ouch.  Do the celebrities still show up and whatnot?  They're god-awful.  I, uh, my ticket connection dried up.  So, I haven't been able to go to a Knick game yet this year.  Huh? 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, I guess our old GM doesn't like us anymore.  With you?  We almost got him fired on numerous occasions.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  He's holding a grudge.  How about some Knick tickets?  Knick tickets.  Scott Farrell wants in on this.  Now more than ever.  Conversation real fast.  Farrell!  Dude, I can get tickets to anything.  Oh, yeah?  I'll get you into whatever you want.  You've got to go with me, though, and binge on beverages and chicks with long legs down  there at the garden, because there's no basketball, but at least the cocktail waitresses are playing 
[00:31:30]  well in the building.  The cocktail waitresses.  They stink.  Hey, Farrell.  What's happening?  You said the Pats were going to lose, my friend.  Dude, they got a job.  That was like the fix of the century.  I threw my TV out the window.  The fix is in, huh?  I kicked a stereo.  I kicked a pile of clothes over, and it was built over the years here at the Hotel California.  And I made just, in general, violent language noise for hours.  I was up until 5 in the morning, pacing like Bob Knight with a brain hemorrhage. 
[00:32:00]  I had a lobotomy after that call.  They did them.  That blitz by Woodson was just a stick.  Everybody walked off the field with their hogs tucked, and they all went to the sideline  like the sissies they are.  And they got danced on.  The Raiders beat them, and they handed it to them.  So now they're going to get their lunch handed to them by Pittsburgh, who's going to beat  them by 25.  And I told you the Rams would win 48-20.  They won 45-17.  And the Eagles will cover that number and dance.  McNabb can dance with anyone.  If you doubt the kid McNabb, you're going to get burned. 
[00:32:30]  I think the dollar bet is to go over to Rainbow and take it.  My buddy won eight times in one day.  8,000.  He took the Rams, did a reverse with the Steelers, Rams and Steelers, and a reverse.  Plus, he had the Steelers and the over.  Bing, that hit.  He had the Rams and the over.  Bing, that hit.  Started the day with nothing.  No ice in his fridge and warm Jamison down the throat.  End of the day, dancing and talking about doing hookers.  That's a good day, my friend.  Hey, it was the right call, though, up there in Massachusetts.  I thought that that sucked, and I think all people from Boston should get syphilis. 
[00:33:00]  God damn.  I hated that call.  That is for sissies.  Anybody there that doesn't think that that was a fumble is a peasant.  I don't care what they think of me.  Well, I'll tell you this much.  Brady did walk to the sideline knowing he fumbled the ball.  He knew it.  Everybody knew it.  No one would say anything.  Not Sims, not Gumbel.  They make too much money.  All I know is...  But according to the rule book, they made the right call, then.  I think the rules sucked.  Just like going to grade school and high school, I had to put up with all their rules, too.  Very good.  I don't like that.  The football game was won by men. 
[00:33:30]  It was a blitz.  It was a beautiful corner call by the Raiders.  I thought they played a great football game.  And now the Patriots will get their lunch.  They're going to see triple blitzes like they've never seen.  It's going to be great to watch them eat some crow, because they don't even deserve to be there.  But the fact that they're there is a disgrace to the league.  And even though the call is whatever they want to make of it, all of their fancy technology,  they can stick in their ear.  Real football fans know what went down.  And anybody that thinks otherwise, you can have it.  You can have your big win in the game.  It doesn't matter. 
[00:34:00]  Wait to see what happens on Sunday when you eat.  Wow, Ben.  But the Raiders stopped playing, my friend.  I wanted to see the Raiders and the Steelers like 76 when they drink a six-pack and play again if you lost,  like Jack Lambert with no teeth.  All I know is the Raiders didn't get the job done.  I'll credit Vanity Terry, and I'll credit the Patriots for going 80 yards on their face.  But they were so stunned.  When it went down, the minute it happened, they even showed up on the scoreboard in the middle of the game.  16-13, there was an error on the scoreboard, too.  The game was so cheesy that in the middle of all of their arguing, they looked up and the scoreboard said 16-13. 
[00:34:30]  Anybody forget that?  No one forgot it because it happened.  The whole thing was like a bad dream when you wake up in puddles of you-know-what in your bed,  and you're like, wow, I've got to change my trowel.  For you, it was a bad dream.  I think that the game was cheesy.  It ruined a great snowball festival.  And if it was...  Hey, how about Phil Simms getting hit with a snowball?  Live on Tuesday.  He deserved it.  All I know, I think Phil's great.  He's an awesome guy.  I've talked to him a million times.  He loves to mess around with sports talk guys, but I'll dance with him any day on that game. 
[00:35:00]  They both went silent like girls.  It was hilarious, though.  Now we're getting reports that he got the guy arrested after the game.  Oh, I'm sure.  Well, you know what?  I mean, he had to watch his son have Applewhite do that big game for Texas down there,  and that probably drove the family into a rubber room.  All I know is that whenever it was a big game, he's a great broadcaster.  There's nothing about Phil Simms.  This doesn't have to do anything with him.  All I know is he was a great quarterback.  He was a great broadcaster. 
[00:35:30]  I've always thought he'd done a great job calling the games until they went Coif City on that one.  I don't care what the rule says.  The football game, the day I grew up and the day anybody grew up watching a football game,  whether it was games back in the day of Lombardi with the Chiefs and the Vikings in the Super Bowls,  or whether it was the Steelers playing the Raiders in the 70s, whether it was the Niners and the Cowboys,  the game was played.  The officials made calls.  You learned to live with it.  Now you can stop a game and reverse a call and ruin what was a great game with that festival of replay cheese. 
[00:36:00]  I mean, it's just sickening that the game can stop now for 25 minutes for that,  and that they take 15 minutes in between for commercial breaks.  I don't know what the commercial breaks are longer.  For the NFL, or for waiting to go on your show, or for watching, you know, the bottom line is,  all they do is take the players stand around scratching their blueberries, waiting for the league to make money.  And this thing that they've invented, where the cheesy 80-year-old linesman can run over and stare into a box for 45 minutes,  and some 90-year-old up top that gets paid off by tags and all the rest of the suits. 
[00:36:30]  I mean, it's a white man's league and a cheesy league.  They've brought in computers and cameras now.  I mean, they don't want anybody to analyze the games on TV replay or on the TV game.  They want everybody to be a homer in the broadcast booth.  No, Howard Cosell would have done them right then and there like they were peasants.  He would have eaten them alive, right on the spot.  This day and age, the mighty dollar always wins.  I have to watch out for my neck.  Oh, let's go to the replay booth.  Let's change the game. 
[00:37:00]  Let's start over.  Here, you win, you lose.  They got screwed.  It was fate, my friend.  Oakland had that.  It was fate.  Had that game right there.  It was over.  Game over.  Yeah, but the Patriots have had a great season.  I won't deny that.  This isn't about me or the Patriots or Phil Simms or anything other than the NFL.  It's like anything else.  They had to cut a deal for $7 million with a bunch of guys that sell used cars to move their event.  They pay off everybody. 
[00:37:30]  Everything's paid off.  It's all about the dollar.  No one likes to hear about it, ever.  No one ever likes the truth.  It comes in slick and slow like a curveball.  All right, hold on, hold on.  When everybody lays it on the line, real football fans know that game got...  It was like tailhook.  Right when they came and turned the lights on and the hookers were about to do everybody,  and then they turned the lights on and told everybody to go home, everybody left all damp.  I mean, it's just like, thanks a lot for ruining it.  It's anticlimactic.  Hey, Pharrell, Pharrell, why don't you talk to a Boston fan, all right? 
[00:38:00]  Dan, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  All right, listen here.  This guy's crazy.  First of all...  I am crazy, and guess what?  You guys have waited long enough.  This guy won't even stop.  You've got to win that way.  The same thing with everything else in Boston.  You guys coif at everything you do.  Who are you kidding?  What's it been, 30 years since you won in hockey?  What's it been, 50 years since you won the football night job the last two times you  went to the Super Bowl?  You got a car, back door, screen door.  Boom.  How do you like that?  Oh, I woke up and my butt was big.  This guy is such an idiot, dude. 
[00:38:30]  I am an idiot.  Look at that.  Look at me.  One guy in an apartment, dude, with your pizza boxes and beer cans.  I got your pizza box right here.  You're a fool.  You weren't even watching the same game.  Your sissy team can't beat anybody.  What team do you like, dude?  Tell me what you like.  Oh, let me just say.  The Rams bandwagon?  Oh, you idiot, dude.  I'm an idiot.  I said it 30 times.  You get off saying that?  I was sitting there hanging out with your wife watching the game, and she said you're  soft, too.  All right.  Jesse wants in.  Jesse, what's up?  Hey, if you watch that play, all right, I mean, if you're going to let me talk, because 
[00:39:00]  you don't let anybody else talk.  That's right.  Who says I had to have anybody talk to me today?  All right.  But listen, it should have been.  The actual call that should have been.  Yeah, you haven't had anything since Larry Bird was being deadbeat dad on his daughter  and jumping in threes from the corner.  Who are you kidding?  If you watch the play, the quarterback slapped him in the head.  Quarterback?  He's not a quarterback.  Did he go to Ann Arbor?  I thought they just turned out kind of like Tyrone Wheatley.  50 yards, automatic first bound. 
[00:39:30]  Now, you guys were about as confident as him in week five as you were your girlfriends  who never show up with their big hairdos.  All right.  Go drink some more kerosene, man.  You rag.  I got something for you.  Go ahead.  The only thing you've got going for you in Boston, nice move on Jason Allison sending  him to the L.A.  Kings.  Nice move up there, Mr. O'Connell.  And you screwed Laviolette, too.  Nice job with that handling.  Hey, Bill.  What's up?  Hey, man.  Hey, meet up.  If you had two brain cells to rub together, you'd be dangerous.  Every time I was on in Boston, I was number one.  Kiss my ass.  Hey, no, man.  I got to tell you something right now. 
[00:40:00]  You sound cool.  Yeah, I'd love to let you talk to me.  You'd love to drink with me and watch football games and hockey games.  I'm the only one that tells it like it is around here.  Everybody in Boston knows me.  What's up in Worcester with all the firemen?  I love you, brother.  Shake it up.  Shake it up.  I'm like a fat boy.  I'm drinking a beer right now for Worcester, and I know how to spell it, baby.  And I love hanging down at Beacon, bringing it hard.  I just clean out of the center.  I called games in there, too.  All losses.  Yeah, I'm a loser.  And that's what they'll do for Sunday.  All right, Pharrell.  Who's in the Super Bowl? 
[00:40:30]  Well, you know it's going to be the Steelers and Rams, but I'm hoping it's the Eagles  so I can go hang with all of the mobsters in Pharrell, Adelphia.  They'll be an all-key stone stater.  We'll drive up and down the Autobahn and make fun of one another's girlfriends.  And silly, all the girls have goth fingernails.  Oh, aren't they lovely?  Pharrell, we've got to get out of here, man.  Pharrell, thank you.  You guys are cool, man.  Anytime.  Hey, Boston, you're a great city.  The football games suck.  Fox Pharrell is a high school football stadium. 
[00:41:00]  It's about time you caught up with everybody else.  All right, thank you.  High school football stadium.  There he goes.  Scott Pharrell.  Andrew Dice Pharrell.  No one can get a word in.  He's our new morning guy here in New York, though.  Give him a listen.  Hey.  Give him a listen.  Boy, that ought to help our Boston numbers.  That ought to look like Washington after that rant.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, boys, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, Ope, I learned that you leave sporting events early, rarely, but you often leave the 
[00:41:30]  radio show early.  What's up with that?  What you want to say was Ope doesn't leave sports early, sports games early, but leave  show early to go to sports games, right?  Right.  It didn't quite come out that way.  And guess who the Islanders are playing tonight?  Oh, don't even talk.  Which means cue up that Jim Brewer bit at 6.30 tonight.  Are you going to the game?  Hell yeah, I'm going to the game.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Rangers having a little trouble.  Just a tad.  Just a tad.  Oh, they're going to get a win in 2002? 
[00:42:00]  All right.  Now we're off schedule.  We were supposed to talk about Tyson.  We'll do that next.  How's that?  All right.  Oh, you guys got to hear this.  I want the...  You want to hear this?  What is that?  A new little sweeper for our show.  Oh, I thought that was the Tyson.  That's Steve put together for our show.  Yes.  Check this out.  Check this out.  Is this a brand of humor you can appreciate?  All right.  Let me get a little saucy here.  For the love of Eve, you bet. 
[00:42:30]  Life serves you up lemons, you make lemonade.  We're a little out of control here.  Stop cracking lies.  Oh, my stars.  Don't f*** yourself.  Tasteless offensive.  A lot of ass grabbing.  Horrific and tasteless.  People going daft.  It just makes me want to stick a knife in someone.  Stuff you get here on this show.  Aren't we supposed to be trying to gain listeners, guys?  No!  The OP&S show.  Is that a surprise to you?  Is that cool, man?  I like that. 
[00:43:00]  Nice.  It's all my stars.  It's a little rambunctious for me, but...  A little saucy.  Saucy.  All right.  A couple phone numbers.  In the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, 866-2774.  For a while, I've got to say something really fast before we take a break.  Naughty nighty contest.  It's on.  What the hell's going on, lady?  Oh, well, they might have been confused from the instructions last week.  All right.  We're on today, right?  We're on.  Any girl wants to come down here and enter in our naughty nighty contest, get your naughty 
[00:43:30]  nighty and get down here.  888 7th Avenue in Manhattan.  Between now and 7 o'clock, we only have two contestants so far.  We look pathetic.  Yeah.  We look really pathetic.  I know.  Awful.  We have cold hard cash up for grabs and a trip to hedonism.  And we're going to throw in some other stuff, all right?  Yeah.  Matter of fact, we'll throw in something for the first girl that shows up today.  I love that little incentive.  That little blonde thing that was all over Jim on Friday.  I think she was supposed to come down today with her naughty nighty.  She wanted in on the contest, so maybe she'll make an appearance, okay? 
[00:44:00]  Hey, what time are you picking up little Gary to go to the game tonight?  It's Islander Rangers, eh?  It's Islander Rangers.  Poor little Gary.  I'll just sit here and watch it on TV.  All right.  Yeah, naughty nighty.  Get down here.  Raunchy audio.  Look like a dog for me.  Spankable video.  I got my thing in my hand here.  All the best parts of the Opian Anthem show end up on foundrymusic.com. 
[00:44:30]  M-E-W.  Instant feedback coming in like crazy today, man.  J.D. from Worcester, Mass, right?  Scott Farrell sounds like Johnny Most.  Now I just wish he would get gangrene and have his legs amputated.  Oh, that's so awful.  Remember Johnny Most?  What was the story with Johnny Most and the hearing aid? 
[00:45:00]  Didn't he swallow one?  Or someone from Boston will help me out.  The funniest was against the Detroit Pistons one time.  I think it was in Detroit.  The Celtics had lost and he was saying all his stuff.  He's like, they're all looking to get me now and I'm an old man.  And he's just a madman.  Yeah, he was a crazy, crazy announcer.  For the Celtics.  Yeah.  Even Bill Lampier.  That was just like the least favorite guy.  Hey, good news, ladies and gentlemen. 
[00:45:30]  Today on the Opian Anthony show, Stalker Patty Cribs.  Yes.  We're Steve and Rick and Stalker Patty.  They are leaving the studio in moments here.  The first of our Cribs installments.  Yes, it's our new series here on the Opian Anthony show.  A complete rip-off of MTV's Cribs.  We didn't even change the name.  Stalker Patty looks like a boy.  You look like a small girl boy.  My hair is going to get long.  It's going to grow.  You've been saying that for months. 
[00:46:00]  It's going to grow.  Remember when she said, I think by Halloween it should be okay.  Well, I over-projected.  I'm a little bit over-potting.  Over-projected.  Over-projected.  You still don't have bangs.  It's been four months.  Trust me.  When they start growing, they grow fast.  I have to-  When they start growing.  It's been growing.  It grows slow.  It doesn't all of a sudden start kicking into gear.  I've never seen a receding hairline on a lady before.  That's awful.  That's wonderful.  I inherited that from my natural father. 
[00:46:30]  And I will have bangs growing right over it.  I thought you didn't know where your natural father was.  Well, I have his picture at home.  Do you do?  Yeah.  Do you go, Daddy, would you leave me?  Did he leave your mom?  Actually, no.  They were never married.  They were just seeing each other.  Oh, a little love child.  Love child.  That's a one-night stand child right there.  One-night stand child.  Oh, is that what happened?  Your dad didn't actually date your mom, right?  Yeah, they went out with each other. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, is it right?  Did you just find her a burger and dump her?  I don't know.  Dump her.  They sure produced me, so they had to be seeing each other.  How did you get a picture of them?  Well, I had one from years and years ago.  From the most wanted poster.  Where did it come from, though?  I thought, didn't they abandon you when you were young?  Well, I was in New York foundling.  They had to give me up.  A foundling?  What's a foundling?  It's New York foundling hospital. 
[00:47:30]  Like an orphanage?  That's where the kids go that they find in the dumpsters.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  Yeah, I wasn't.  All I'm saying is, if your parents, you know, your father slammed one to your mom.  Yeah.  They had you.  Yeah.  Now, you were instantly like, hey, we don't want it?  Well, no, my mother raised me alone for nine months.  He was married.  You really made the commitment, huh?  Not even a year.  He had a family and a wife uptown when he was seeing us.  Oh, we did. 
[00:48:00]  You know, he probably visited me.  Oh, my God.  Your mom was a hooker.  Yeah.  What happened there?  Was your mom like a little hose bag?  Well, she got involved in, I guess, some drinking and stuff.  Oh, wow.  She abandoned me, you know, on a counter.  On a counter?  Yeah.  How did that happen?  Where were you left?  Well, I was left in a restaurant, a diner.  Isn't that weird?  And now you work at McDonald's?  No.  This one was way downtown.  It's not there anymore.  You were left on the counter of a diner? 
[00:48:30]  I think it's the exact same thing because I found it.  You found the place.  You went hunting for your roots like a goddamn salmon.  Hey, wait.  What diner?  It was called the Downtowners Diner.  Where's that?  And it was at One Trinity Place.  There's a Friday's now.  There.  Can't we write on the counter, Stalker Patty was left here?  Left here.  It's like a famous place.  No, it's maybe that old counter was torn down and a new one was torn down. 
[00:49:00]  So you're nine months old.  Yeah.  Your mom puts you on the counter of a restaurant and walks?  Well, no.  She asked the waitress, can you please call her father who lives uptown?  He gave her her phone number.  Here's your tip.  And I was just left laying there in the basket.  She had me in a real liquor basket, like a baby carrier in the shape of a basket.  So she leaves you on there and then did your father come and get you?  Of course not.  No, he didn't.  The police came and got me.  So your father didn't come and get you. 
[00:49:30]  The waitress called me.  So how did you get the picture of your father?  If you were only nine.  By who?  You're nine months old.  You didn't all of a sudden.  Like how do you even know who your parents were if you're nine months old?  Is your father still alive?  No, he isn't.  He died when I was eight, but he used to visit me.  And I got pictures from his visitation.  They were laughing too hard.  I didn't hear what you said.  Oh, he used to visit you.  Oh, visit.  Okay.  Yeah, and they took photos of me and him.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  It's a baby picture of me and him.  Wow.  Why did she leave you there?  Was it because you looked like a little pterodactyl?  No.  No, she just couldn't deal with the pressure of having a baby.  Where's your mama hook her?  Was she?  I don't know.  I know that she worked in a burlesque place.  Oh, my God.  She was a stripper.  Showgirl.  She was a stripper.  I don't know.  Patty's mother was a stripper?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think so.  You're a lap dance gone bad.  Oh, God. 
[00:50:30]  And he used to go there as a patron, I guess.  Oh, your mom was a hooker.  The planet was going to explode, so I was put in a spaceship and sent to Earth.  Powers above and beyond that immutable man.  Oh, my God.  My father was...  Your story gets better and better the longer we know you.  This is like three years later, over three years later, and when you just found out her  mother was a stripper and her father was married, the mother gets knocked up and abandons her 
[00:51:00]  in a diner on a counter.  How many kids did your dad have?  Well, he had his own daughter uptown who was six years older than me, who I don't even know.  You don't know her?  No.  I don't know her.  We'd love to find Patty's half-sister and see what she's doing.  Her mother's name was Letitia Hammer.  You know, that...  Hey, let's do one of those Sally Jesse Raphael shows.  Can we do that?  Dude, work on this.  Any private dicks out there that know how this stuff works, please get in touch with us. 
[00:51:30]  I would love to bring...  And this is my dream, that it's a very successful woman that would come in here, has a great  family and job, and see what happens.  It's just a few jeans twisted the wrong way, and you get Patty.  Oh, thank you.  Although having another kook like Patty would be great, too.  Hey, I'm Patty's sister. 
[00:52:00]  I work at Burger King.  Hey, Paul, you just slapped Burger King with part-time at Hershey's.  I don't know if she's even around.  That's what I do with she is.  Hey, Paul, what's up?  We're in a lot of cities, though, Patty.  We're in a lot of...  How old would she be?  She's six years older than me.  81.  82.  46.  52.  About 52.  52.  Yeah.  All right.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I just wanted to say, some people walk out and get their hiv on a one-night stand. 
[00:52:30]  And who's the unlucky bastard who had stalker Patty?  You can only dream of the hiv.  And you know...  I even wonder if she even knows they exist.  I have no idea.  Yeah.  No.  No one knows you exist.  And you know it wasn't even...  Your dad wanted that hush-hush.  Look, I'll visit the damn thing.  Every once in a while.  We'll take some pictures next to the swings at a park.  But that is it.  Don't tell my wife.  I have a family.  It's not even a picture of her father.  You know it's Vic Tabak.  That's who she's carrying around.  Oh, she's carrying around something.  I even know her name.  Clipped out of a TV guide. 
[00:53:00]  It's my dad.  I found out who she was when I was a student at the time.  And I had gotten some death benefits from my father for about two years.  All right.  He paid off.  How much?  At $200 a month.  That's it?  For two years?  Well, it was back in 1974.  What did he do for a living?  Do you know offhand?  I have no...  He was a stockbroker on Wall Street.  He was a flamenco dancer.  I don't know.  A flamenco dancer.  Carlos?  Mama dancing? 
[00:53:30]  Not here.  My mother never did this.  Well, you know, it's interesting because...  Carlos.  Her name would be Valerie F. Brooks.  That's how I found out her name.  You know, and I went to...  That would be whose name?  They wanted to take...  Wait, wait, wait.  That's whose name?  That's my half-sister's name.  Valerie Brooks.  She's sitting there right now going,  Oh, my God.  My sister's stalker party.  I listened to this show and my sister...  You know, what happened is they wanted to take away part of my benefits at the time  because of something she... 
[00:54:00]  Some debt that she owed in the 60s.  And I had to go and buy it.  I don't know what she owed, but I had to go and say,  Look, I don't know this person.  I don't know why this happened.  I don't know.  I'm innocent.  And your mom and I was with the Symbionese Liberation Army.  Oh, I didn't tell you that.  When I went to the moon...  And I was that I won the case.  They didn't touch my benefits.  Your mom was a stripper and she was banging stockbrokers on the side for extra money.  Yeah, that's what it sounds like.  So, I don't know.  And then she got knocked off and a bag broke somewhere along the line and... 
[00:54:30]  Hello, Patty.  Oh, my God.  Where's the wig?  Why are you not wearing a wig?  Oh, I don't need it anymore.  My hair is growing.  He must have been like,  This is worse than the crash of 29.  Patty.  Having Patty.  The crash of 55.  Anthony.  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Yo, I was wondering, like,  since Patty doesn't know who her mom or dad is,  this is like twins where they made, like,  the man juice milkshake to make, like, the superwoman.  And then, like, stalker patties, like the leftovers, like the Danny DeVito. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  You might have a hot twin out there.  Or a hot sister, anyway.  Oh, I know I'm not a twin.  No, I know.  I mean a hot sister.  Well, Patty, does your mother's lifestyle have any bearing on what you,  the decisions you've made in your life to remain a virgin  and not partake in any alcohol or anything like that?  Well, the alcohol and drugs I never did because I, for health reasons,  I want to stay healthy and I want to live a long time.  Why didn't anyone adopt you?  A lot of athletes do drugs and they're healthy. 
[00:55:30]  Don't worry about it.  Well, you know...  I hear it's hard to adopt kids these days.  Why didn't Patty get adopted?  Well, it costs a lot of money to adopt a child, I guess.  And you get paid when you have foster children.  You get checks.  So you were a foster child?  Yeah.  How many families did you have to live with?  Oh, we've went over this lots.  Did we?  I remember this.  How many touched you?  Well, I've had about three or four by the time I was two.  How many played Kiss the Dinky for ice cream? 
[00:56:00]  I even lived in Beck Pate's Long Island in a baby home.  I don't...  What's a baby home?  What is a baby?  I don't know.  It sounds like she's from the 1800s.  And then they sent Mary off to the blind school, but it burnt down.  So we all had to move to Sleepy Eye.  And then Walnut Grove went broke, so we went to Mankato, but they had a plug.  Please, sir, I want some more.  I don't know where we have pages.  It's Patty.  It's all Long Island.  Can I have more? 
[00:56:30]  I'm hungry.  I'm hungry.  Instead of Annie, it's Patty.  Patty.  It's a hard-necked life for us.  It's a hard-necked life for us.  Where's Daddy?  Where's Daddy?  Dave wants to know if your dad's picture came with a frame.  Yeah, buddy.  Yeah, my father's picture is there.  Just let it come out tomorrow, but you're beautiful, dearly, that tomorrow, there'll be fun. 
[00:57:00]  I'm left in a counter in a restaurant.  Hold on.  Frank the Cop, I don't know if this is legit.  Frank the Cop, what's up?  Not much, man.  What's going on?  Are you just effing with us, or what?  No, no.  I just did a license check over the car computer.  Yeah.  And we have a Valerie Brooks, born in 48, that lives in Astoria.  How old is she?  48.  48, that's in range. 
[00:57:30]  She was born in 48.  That's what I'm saying, 48, 50.  Oh, that kind of figures.  Hey, born in 48, she's working on 54 now.  That would figure, right?  Well, I was told she was born in 49, but maybe she was born in 49.  48, 49, that's supposed to be for me.  Wow.  Look who you're dealing with.  Exactly.  Wait, so she lives in Astoria?  Yeah.  Oh, that's classic.  That would be interesting.  No way. 
[00:58:00]  All right.  Someone's got to get the info from Frank.  We might have to surprise her live on the show today.  Hey, guess what?  Oh, guess what?  Guess what?  Yes.  That's retarded sister.  I hope you have a hockey helmet for those Thanksgiving dinners, because we're setting potty over.  Frank, thanks for the info.  No problem.  You want it?  I'll give it to you off the air.  Hold on.  Yeah, that's something we can't put on the air.  That would be interesting.  All right.  So what's a baby home?  I don't know.  A place where they take an infant. 
[00:58:30]  So they take you in and, like, have to feed you with absolutely no love and caring whatsoever.  I don't know.  You know what an infant needs?  I have no way of knowing that.  Here's what an infant needs.  It needs to be coddled by its mommy.  It needs to suckle.  It needs to be appreciated and loved.  And there's Patty on this assembly line at a baby home, and they're just shoving a bottle in your face.  I don't know that they were like that.  I have no idea how old it was.  Oh, the baby home, it's obvious.  You go there, and then they decide which ones are good enough to send to the adoption agency. 
[00:59:00]  And the other ones go down the chute to the basement.  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  What a life.  Some are adopted and loved, and some they just take Polaroids of and make Danish movies out of.  Oh, my God.  Holy ass.  All right.  Wow, Patty.  Well, it's stalker Patty Cribs on the show today.  Yeah, and we did learn a little bit about her.  A little background on that. 
[00:59:30]  God.  James is like, this could scar Patty's sister for life.  Valerie, you have a sister, and she looks like a male hooker from my own private Idaho.  Yeah.  So your mom was in burlesque.  That's basically stripper, man.  Do you have any pictures of your mom?  Let me tell you who says they were a burlesque star.  Uh-huh.  Sandy Kane.  Really?  Sandy Kane says she was a burlesque.  She'd have to be a lot older than she lets on, then, because you'd have to be actually 65, 70 years old. 
[01:00:00]  Patty, you got pictures of your mom?  I could look around and see if I could find any.  Well, maybe you have any at your abode when we...  No, not right now, because everything's put away in storage, but I only have my father out.  I want to see pictures of your mom.  I have my father out there in the frame.  How long is it going to take to get to your crib?  Okay, we're driving there, about 40 minutes.  About 40 minutes.  All right, hopefully a little after 5, we're going to start stalker patty cribs. 
[01:00:30]  As long as they're not bringing a butterfly down in the hole, we should be able to get down there pretty quick, because the wings clog up the works.  You guys ready to leave?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get a picture of her father, who was in the frame.  Yeah.  And if you can find a picture of your mother at some point, we want to see that hot minx.  Yeah, well, I'll bring that in on another day.  Get knocked up out of wedlock in what year?  What year were you conceived?  I was born in 55 in June, so I was conceived.  Oh, Jesus, just a girl with a rep. 
[01:01:00]  Your father was in hell.  They just wanted a little fun on the side, and look what happened.  She was in her 20s, so I was like 25, 30-year age.  Oh, my God, in the car, probably.  Your dad must be making a lot of money, stockbroker, banging a younger broad.  Yeah.  That was a stripper.  And I'm not sure that, you know, Valerie knows I, maybe she knows I exist.  I don't know.  She knows now.  That's great.  All right.  You can hear it over the radio.  The old A on the radio. 
[01:01:30]  This thing's not working out.  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Five bucks.  It's going right in the 50s.  Blue moon, you left me standing alone.  Okay.  Well, I'll put it in my mouth for food.  Wait, another guy has found...  All right.  Scrape up a 10, and you can do me. 
[01:02:00]  Another guy has found Patty's sister.  Bill, the cop.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, I'm a friend of Norton.  I think you might remember me.  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  You're a tall guy?  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  How you doing?  Not bad.  There's another one from...  Big mule.  Huh, Bill?  Yeah, there's another one from Brooklyn.  Oh, there's another one in Brooklyn?  Born in what year?  49.  That would be six years before she was born.  Oh.  All right, hold on, please.  Hold on, please.  Yeah, Patty's pretty positive that it's 49, not 48. 
[01:02:30]  Who would think there's two ladies out there with the same name that are very close in age?  Yeah, considering there's only 8 million people in New York.  No, but the name.  The name is kind of unusual.  They have a mother with a name like Letitia.  That's what I'm saying.  Thank you.  Only, that's a very unusual name, so...  All right, Bill, give us the info off air, all right?  10-4.  God, I love the cops helping us.  Thank you.  NYPD, you rule.  That's something.  Letitia Hammer?  Sounds hot.  Yeah.  That's my grandpa. 
[01:03:00]  That was her stage name.  You probably don't even know your mom's real name.  No, no, that was my father's...  Ladies and gentlemen, come to the stage, Letitia Hammer.  That would have been Valerie's mother.  That was Valerie's natural mother.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, let me get the music for...  That was Letitia Hammer.  Letitia Hammer was Valerie's mother, who my father was married to.  No one is named Letitia Hammer, for real.  That was a stage name.  Yeah, this is exactly what I wanted.  Oh, well, the other one.  Ah, hookah. 
[01:03:30]  Get the girls, girls, girls.  Ah, hookah.  All right, I could try this one.  And knows what he's doing.  All right, here you go.  We'll go back in time, even though Motley Crue wasn't around.  Just...  Hang with us.  It's an illusion.  Ladies and gentlemen, give it up.  Give a nice, warm welcome, making her way to the stage.  You might have seen her on the Jackie Gleason show.  Yeah, here she is.  Give a warm welcome as she makes her way to the stage with her pasties on. 
[01:04:00]  She really knows how to give it up.  And you can F her later for ten bucks.  Just don't get her pregnant.  The beautiful Letitia Hammer.  Give it up for Letitia.  We're all going to get laid.  The music's a little harsh, but believe me, in a few years, people are going to love this.  Hey, we have Stalker Patty's father at the strip club. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, yeah?  Watching Letitia Hammer dance.  You're a filthy whore.  All right, Letitia is the wife.  Yeah, we know.  It doesn't work any other way, Patty.  Wait, who was the one?  Letitia was the father's wife.  Right.  So what was your mom's name?  That works the whole bit.  Virginia what?  Zwick.  Virginia's wick doesn't work.  That was her name.  Virginia's wick?  Yes.  Ladies and gentlemen, Virginia's wick.  She'll hob your wick.  Virginia's wick. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, she passed away about two years ago.  All right, so...  She got the hip?  No.  From all the ladies that your father was banging?  The miles of sea that went through her?  What did she...  His own wife?  What did she die of?  Embarrassment.  I don't know.  Old days?  I don't know.  She was 70?  David, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  How you doing?  What's up?  Listen, Patty could be the first case of a surviving pickle punk.  Pickle punk.  Pickle punk.  Yeah, perhaps. 
[01:05:30]  You guys rule.  I wonder why your mother decided to have you.  Well, back then, that was really not much of an option.  Well, she was also kind of pseudo-religious, too.  Really?  Is that why she went?  Her Catholicism saved my life.  Wait, your stripper mom was religious?  She was a Catholic, and they didn't believe in abortion, so she had me in secret, I guess.  She had you in secret.  A dirty little secret.  And then plunked it down on the counter to pay for breakfast.  Yeah, it was a tip.  Patty was a tip.  Oh, no, no, I was with her for nine months before she did that. 
[01:06:00]  A 30% ugly infant.  She couldn't find a decent enough restaurant to leave you in.  I know you guys got to go, but the phones are unbelievable.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, I just think it's ironic that Patty was left on a restaurant counter, and now she works  behind one.  I guess this is her whole life's ambition.  She's done.  Too bad it didn't leave you in front of a law office.  Hey, Ralph, what's up?  Hey, nothing, man.  Listening to Patty Stalker's story there reminds me of the omen, where the orphanage burns 
[01:06:30]  down.  I bet if you look hard enough, they'll probably find some type of mule or a horse in a grave.  That's probably why she's got the hoof feet.  Oh, I'm getting that corrected next week on Monday.  Dr. Jack will...  We're supposed to do that live on the show, though.  Yeah.  Oh, I have to call them for directions.  They're going to do it Monday.  Rick will work it out.  Patty, isn't it a coincidence that the restaurant you were left at is now, I thank God, it's  Fridays, and your mother said, thank God, this isn't my problem anymore, when she left 
[01:07:00]  you there?  It's a little bit of a coincidence there, right?  TGIF, thank God I'm free.  She was very unstable.  She was institutionalized.  She was?  Yeah.  What mental institution?  I don't even know.  Different ones.  Belvia or something like that?  New Jersey.  Different places.  I hate this kid.  Medication doesn't work anymore.  I don't even know where.  Different places.  TGIF.  Wow.  Really? 
[01:07:30]  Tell guys I'll F.  For a long time after that, Patty was just worn as one of those buttons on their suspenders  in the restaurant.  That's how they cared for her.  That's how she earned her keep.  Boing!  Wah!  Wah!  I'm hungry.  Wah!  It's a huge necklace. 
[01:08:00]  Actually, they told me I was very quiet as a baby.  I didn't eat much.  The duct tape helped.  I'm sure.  Wait, you were treated.  Shut up, kid.  I just pictured all in black and white with a lot of wooden walls and beatings with rulers  and whatnot.  She'd get savagely punched every time her hammer toes clumped on the wood floor and woke her  father up.  Velociraptor-like toenails.  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  Did you grow up?  When did you finally get with a family, or did you?  Well, I was with the foster family from two years old up until I finished high school.  Ah!  On Staten Island.  Staten Island!  Yeah.  And were there chances that people came over to check you out to adopt you and they just  said no?  I don't know.  Yeah?  I have no idea.  I'm sure.  Like, they would come over to the house.  Hi, these are friends just visiting.  They sit down.  Kind of watch her in her natural environment. 
[01:09:00]  Does she have to drool quite so much?  No, it's okay.  Don't worry about it.  Take her, please.  No, I was a very clean baby.  I never drooled.  Yeah?  In fact, I was so dirt conscious, I didn't like to get dirty as a kid.  Your mother sure did.  Down and dirty.  I did, only when I got into my tomboy stage when I was like five years old through like  12 or 13, you know, I used to prefer to play with dump trucks and stuff like that, little  toy tonkas and stuff, you know. 
[01:09:30]  You know, then I would get a little dirty.  All right.  Well, we got to let these guys, let these kids go so we can do Stalker Patty Cribs today.  No, that's okay.  We can still sit around and talk to Patty.  This is a great setup for the Stalker Patty Cribs.  Joe D., the private investigator.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Pretty good.  Private dick.  Listen, I could get a little basic information from her.  I could find her mother, her sister, whatever she's trying to look for.  Oh, the mother's dead.  Everyone's dead except this half-sister.  Yeah.  All right.  Give me the information.  I'll find her for you. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah?  Put her on the show.  She might even be better than this one.  All right.  Hold on the line, okay?  Okay.  We'll go.  Get his number and we'll talk to him off air as well.  All right.  Well, we should let Steve and Rick and Stalker Patty go.  No, it's okay.  Yeah, thank you.  What other kind of tragedy has been in her life, man?  You know, through a private investigator, this is a great idea.  Idea.  Excuse me.  Bill.  Hey, you sound like Bruce.  I know.  For a second.  Boys, I have an idea.  To pay you nothing and you work for me.  You don't need an agent to move to Worcester, Mass. 
[01:10:30]  Boys, come to Worcester.  I'll negotiate the deal for you.  But you're negotiating with yourself.  Yes.  That's a true story.  I have an idea.  Our old boss decided to negotiate with himself.  He goes, if you want to have the contract renoved by a lawyer, I have a lawyer friend of mine that will gladly look it up.  He's like, Bruce, isn't that a conflict of interest?  No.  I have a lawyer and he's not a shwoogie.  We were stupid enough to say, uh, okay.  Okay, bro, say, okay, we'll sign it. 
[01:11:00]  Bill, what's up?  Happy to be here.  Bill.  Hey.  Yo, I think we should put together, or you guys should put together, Stalker Patty, This  is your life.  It's not a bad idea.  Start out with TGI Fridays and go from boarding house to boarding house to, like, old-co-nurses.  That would make a great even true Hollywood story.  And just show how beautiful my life is.  Even true Hollywood stories.  I don't think it's scary straight.  All right, Bill.  Thank you.  Thanks.  Very good.  You know, George, the phone calls are getting better, and these guys got to go.  George, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, ONA, what's up? 
[01:11:30]  Hey, man.  He single-handedly ended the right-to-life movement.  Yeah, today is the end of the rights-to-life argument.  Even hardcore Christian groups are saying, all right, sometimes abortion.  Religious people are punching their pregnant wives in their stomach.  I think it's 29 years ago today, Roe versus Wade, or 28, 29, around there.  Roe versus Wade, as you like to say.  Roe versus Wade.  Roe versus Wade.  And now here's someone that could get hospital records.  Anthony, what's up? 
[01:12:00]  Hello.  Hey, man.  Yeah, I'm a handyman in Staten Island for the Foundling Hospital.  A handyman.  I have access to the records, and I can check it out.  You went to the Foundling Hospital at Staten Island?  Yes.  Now, I need to know if she's in Staten Island or where was she in Brooklyn or Manhattan.  She was in Staten Island.  I lived on Staten Island.  Talk to a mic.  Talk to a mic.  I lived on Staten Island.  I was placed from the New York Foundling in New York City.  But I have a branch on Staten Island in all my...  You're a foundling.  I love that word. 
[01:12:30]  It's so 1800s.  You're a foundling.  Foundling.  Your wheel is foundling.  Foundling.  The foundling hospital.  That's awful.  F-O-U-N-C-I.  F-O-U.  Of course.  Oh, my God.  Check that out.  In Manhattan, right?  The foundling.  I was placed from Manhattan, and I always, when I went to see the worker, I would always  go to the one in Staten Island.  Oh, Staten Island.  I used to be on Dumont, and then they moved to Tompkins.  All right. 
[01:13:00]  Well, we're trying to get away from heart.  That's where I'm at, Tompkins Avenue.  Yeah.  Screw it.  Abandon this building.  We'll build a new one.  Leave her here.  That's where I'm at, Tompkins Avenue.  I'm no rocket scientist, but it doesn't sound good to be a foundling.  I never knew anyone that's been a foundling.  Have you ever...  Did you ever hear of anyone that was a foundling?  This is like old time...  With that pocket picker kid, the friggin' Oliver.  It's like Oliver. 
[01:13:30]  Run out and sell papers.  Extra.  Extra, extra.  Read all about it.  In fact, I think Mrs. Elaine Murphy's still there because she used to be the last social  worker right now.  We got rid of that guy.  Listen, I've got to break in here because the Pope is checking in.  Yes, sir.  Oh, yes.  This is the Pope.  I just want to let you know it is okay after hearing this conversation to have any type of  abortion.  Well, the Pope is now on the side of...  Thank you.  I cannot let this happen again.  Thank you, boys. 
[01:14:00]  The Pope is now pro-choice.  All right.  We've got to get these guys out of here.  Wow.  This is a continuing story.  This show is a lot of soap operas.  Is Patty's mom...  Intertwining at all times.  In the same institution as Freddy Krueger's mom.  Remember that?  Yeah.  A thousand maniacs had sex with our gang rape during the institution.  And that was the...  The spawn was Freddy Krueger.  Patty Krueger.  I'm your girlfriend now.  Oh. 
[01:14:30]  Oh.  Look, I got the glove with the blades, but they're made out of your david chiclets so  they don't hurt anyone.  Patty, is this the first time you're going to be in a car?  No.  In a while?  I've been in a car.  I've been in a car before.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Not in the back seat like your mom, right?  No.  Legs hyped up on the back window.  What a great story.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-bang-a-dang-bang. 
[01:15:00]  Burlesque dancer.  Would you have the pasties and stuff?  I don't know.  Spinning them around?  I wouldn't know.  Awful.  I just picture her act like that episode of Happy Days when Richie and Potsie and Ralph  went to the strip club and his father was there.  Picture that kind of act going on, right?  Da-na-na-na.  Da-na-na-na.  She comes out on the stage, takes her gloves off and leaves.  A bunch of guys going, hubba-hubba.  Hubba-hubba. 
[01:15:30]  23 skidoo.  Whip.  What?  All right.  Time for cribs.  Yeah, the phones have gone nuts, but we've got to get these guys on the road.  It's always a revelation.  Later on the show today, Starker Patty Cribbs.  Yeah.  And as we take a break, we go to the FU line.  We still haven't talked about Tyson, and it's like the story of the day, Anthony.  I mean, what are we waiting for?  What are we waiting for?  We'll be back.  Hey, thanks for calling, and here's the Opie to Anthony FU line.  Yeah, this is a big FU for my associate, Pete, who works in the auto in Long Island. 
[01:16:00]  You are the biggest douchebag I've ever f***ing met, you faggot.  Get a f***ing real job.  You think you're better than everyone else?  You're a 33-year-old f***ing loser.  You got the receipt for that jacket?  Go f***ing return it, you f***ing faggot.  Next message.  Yeah, I'd like to leave a big f***ing U to the people who like to call people's houses,  and then when you wait for the answering machine to pick up, they don't leave a f***ing message.  But they'll keep calling your number forever and ever and ever until you finally get fed up and pick up, 
[01:16:30]  and then it's a goddamn salesman, and then you slam the phone down and want to rip your frickin' skull off.  F*** you, and you suck.  Next message.  I want to send a big FU out to the Chicago Bears and any other f***ing team that opposes the Eagles.  Eagles rule they will go all the way.  Next message.  Hey, I want to give a big FU to Canada.  End of message.  Have you ever seen the people that listen to the show? 
[01:17:00]  Obi and Anthony.  Toothless, drunk, and white trash.  Ah, you got your own.  And E.W.  Ah, oh, sorry.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Dang, dang, dang.  Rick's on the line.  Rick, what's up?  It's already started.  Why?  We're only in the garage getting Steve's car out, and the questions are just... 
[01:17:30]  From everything.  From the elevator to what button, why are we pushing that button?  Where, if I remember this elevator from Hungathon, I hate you asses.  Have fun with Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  Leave her at a restaurant.  Like, on the way back or something.  Tell her that you just got to stop somewhere, and then leave her.  Leave her at, thank God I'm free.  Yeah.  Go to a TGI Friday's, tell her to just run in and get some coffee, and then pull away. 
[01:18:00]  Not a problem.  Good memories.  I'm working on another one, and I need the T. I need the T. It's driving me nuts.  TGIF.  I got Get It's Father, but I need something for the first T. It's driving me crazy.  It's blank.  Get It's Father.  Blank.  Get It's Father.  Starting with T. Help me out.  I don't have it.  All right, Rick.  All right.  Thank you. 
[01:18:30]  Later.  There's another problem happening today.  Yeah.  Rick has hit the road, and we all know Rick is in charge of photography for the O.P. and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Photography.  So now, we have two really hot girls that just showed up from Long Island for the Naughty Nighty Contest.  Yeah.  And Rick is gone, so now, well, the job of taking the pictures,  falls in Stinky's lap.  Are you going to be able to, like, get him into some poses and stuff? 
[01:19:00]  Of course.  Don't worry.  You sure?  I'm Hansel Adams.  Hansel Adams.  Stinky Adams.  Stinky Adams.  He'll have him up on some bluff in some canyon.  It'll be in black and white.  All right.  Okay.  Bend over.  Bend over.  Close-ups, Garrett.  Close-ups.  Have faith.  You know what it is?  Rick has no couth and no class, and it makes for great pictures because he doesn't care what he says.  The girls always say, man, I felt so awkward. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Not because guys were watching, just because of the position.  Rick's not afraid to get his hands in there and get dirty.  You know what I mean?  He's moving feet.  He's grabbing ankles and twisting.  Just turn this way.  But Oasis is not supposed to turn this way.  Shut up.  Do it.  Do it.  Smack him in with a rock.  Is this going to help me win?  Yeah, yeah.  Click, click, click.  Yeah, Rick's not afraid like that, Stinky.  You've got to lead with your balls. 
[01:20:00]  When the ladies are ready, when they're in their naughty 90s, we'll bring them in and we'll talk to them a little bit.  Naughty 90 contest on.  Ladies, it's not too late.  You have until 7 tonight if you're in the New York area to stop by with your naughty 90.  We've got cold hard cash and a trip to hedonism to give away, right?  And let me tell you something.  This is a little challenge.  This is what I like about syndication, Anthony.  We're broadcasting live from Philadelphia Friday.  I will guarantee the girls are going to come out of the woodwork to be a part of this naughty 90 contest when we're live in Philly.  Oh, yeah.  All you Philly ladies, all you have to do is show up at the station between 3 and 7 Friday to get your pictures taken. 
[01:20:30]  And you're in on the contest.  Yes.  It's that easy.  All right.  The city is getting involved here.  What were you going to say?  You don't remember?  Oh, oh, oh.  No.  Yeah, I kind of fast forwarded my instant feedback there.  Well, all right.  People are getting the tea for me.  Carolyn.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  I wanted to help you out with your acronym.  Oh, it's Caroline, Brian.  Sorry.  That's okay.  I hate that.  It's one name. 
[01:21:00]  Carolyn, Caroline, whatever.  Brian.  Oh, it's time to get rid of one of those names.  All right.  What's your take?  Well, it's really in homage to Anthony, but twat.  Twat.  Mama.  Get its father.  Yeah, because if you think about it, they were leaving the baby at the diner counter.  So there would be a lady behind the counter, so you scream, twat, get its father.  Get its father.  Oh.  I kind of like that.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Let me see if Frankie D has one.  Frankie D, what's up?  Hey, O1A.  Hey. 
[01:21:30]  I think it's either Tyrannosaurus because of her toes or a three-toed tree frog.  Tree frog.  And when are you going to take little Gary to the game, damn it?  It's the Rangers tonight.  Oh, come on, O.  It's the Rangers.  Oh, B.  You're not doing the right thing by this kid.  Maybe that's what it could stand for.  Take Gary.  It's Friday.  Oh, there you go.  Jeff has it.  There goes its father.  Yes.  All right.  Paul from Lyons says, this girl is effed. 
[01:22:00]  And he's got the F spelt out.  Very good.  All right.  So Stinky will be taking the pictures of the Naughty Nighty contestants tonight.  We've got a blonde and a brunette.  And their pictures will be up later on today on, I don't know, all our websites, opinanthony.com,  foundrymusic.com.  And any other girls want to come down and get their picture taken in their Naughty Nighty?  Feel free.  All you do is come down here.  Hey, Dan, what's up?  How are you doing?  You're the editor of Details Magazine? 
[01:22:30]  Yes, I am.  Oh.  How about that?  Nice.  Did you take over for Mark Golan?  What's that?  You take over for Mark Golan?  Yeah, I took over after Mark left.  We loved Mark.  Mark didn't leave.  Wasn't he removed from his post?  I don't know.  He was a good friend of ours.  He's a good guy.  What is Mark doing now?  I think Mark is working for AOL.  Or actually, I think he's in charge of doing the content for the Moviefone website.  Really?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.  Oh, my God.  Hello.  He fell hard.  And it was right after they featured him on CNN. 
[01:23:00]  People on the news or something.  Well, details lured him away from Maxim.  Yes, they did.  They tried to make details a little more like Maxim.  Yeah.  And then something didn't work, and he got bounced from details.  And now he's working on the Moviefone website?  That's what I think.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure.  Is it true that he was left on a restaurant shelf?  No.  Little Mark Golan.  Exactly.  With his resume.  With his resume. 
[01:23:30]  Smoking his cigarettes.  Right.  Hey, he was always a lot of fun on this show.  He had some great ideas.  And did Mark Golan ever put us in Maxim or Details?  When he was working for both...  Did he?  No.  See?  Come on.  Son of a bitch.  Dan put us in the...  How about that?  Dan put us in the latest issue of Details Magazine.  There you go.  Very good.  We're talking about man's junk, but we're still on the...  Yeah.  Hey, you know what?  It's worthy of discussion, all right?  Yeah, those underwear are a bit much.  Have you seen them?  Do you wear them there, Dan?  I do not, no.  I'm strictly a boxer guy. 
[01:24:00]  Are you a boxer?  Yeah.  I'm the standard Fruit of the Loom type.  That's still a tighty-whighty, though, isn't it?  Those are awful.  Why?  Fruit of the Loom.  They're like big diapers.  They're terrible.  Diapers, that's enough.  What do you wear, Norton?  Boxers.  Boxers bunch up when you pull your pants up.  They don't.  No, they don't.  They're very comfortable.  And you got the short sides?  No, no.  I'm going down.  No, not you, Dan.  I'm asking you.  What, the bikini briefs?  Not bikini.  What do you got on the side?  Like four? 
[01:24:30]  I got whatever's Fruit of the Loom.  Your standard Fruit of the Looms.  Oh.  They're hot.  What do you wear?  I think I wear the most popular one, Boxer Briefs.  Oh, those, God damn.  The old, the hybrid.  That's wedgie wear.  No, they make your bag stick to your leg.  Dude, those also, Boxer Briefs?  Boxer Briefs.  It feels like you're getting a wedgie all the time.  It's right up the crack.  Dude, boxers.  Be a man.  Boxers, stop it.  First of all, they bunch up.  Don't pull your pants down, though.  That's all right, look.  Let me see your box.  That's gay.  It's not gay.  They bunch up, and not only that. 
[01:25:00]  They don't bunch up.  There's some trickling going down the leg.  Big deal.  That don't happen with a boxer.  Jim, those are the worst.  These are awful.  I usually wear silk boxers.  They just make the mule slide.  They're great.  I'm not kidding you.  Mule sliding, Dan.  I'm telling you, you rub the outside of the pant.  Right, pant.  And you have that silk on mule, and you just feel like you're ready for the evening.  Like when I put on my sister's panties.  What?  I did that once with a young gal.  You did, did you?  I really did.  I feel bad for the hookers that have to see your boxers. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, they don't mind them.  All these boxers down.  They're like, what a treat.  Do you have socks with garters on them to hold them up to when you're in your boxers  and black shoes standing there with your boxers and garters with the black socks?  Boxers are hip, man.  Nice beater t-shirt.  Okay, be me.  You have Burt Reynolds boxers from that movie Striptease with Denny Moore.  All right, you're right.  This pair stinks.  They're awful.  I'll agree.  This pair's awful.  They're striped.  And it's not about you, Jim.  We're talking to the editor of Details.  Yeah.  We're talking about underwear, so I figured I would jump in. 
[01:26:00]  I mean, it's rare we talk this sexy.  Now, on the other hand, those underwear that would feature in details, that...  Well, these are the Calvin Klein's.  It's pretty much a ball bag.  It's supposed to make you look like your junk is hanging real low from the front.  Yeah.  So, it's a camouflage.  What it does is it takes the yam bag and makes it look like that's your junk in the front of the underwear.  More or less, yeah.  I mean, it basically definitely helps enhance what you've got going on there. 
[01:26:30]  It pushes it all forward.  Yeah, everything's being pushed forward.  Like the old 80s hairdo on the girls.  Yeah, exactly.  Big waterfall hair.  You're leading with your junk.  Yeah.  That's bad, too.  You are leading with your junk.  It's a ballsy move.  Yeah, but, sir...  Yes, sir?  The problem with those things is, like, at least with boxers, you can breathe.  With that pear, it's almost like a neck brace.  If you sweat at all, the whole area is going to smell like an onion ring.  There's no reason for that.  Oh, my God.  I did.  Jesus.  How would you know what it smells like? 
[01:27:00]  Come on, look, man.  I don't even want to know.  We've all done the finger move after cutting the grass.  Oh, God, no.  Hey, Dan, you sure you want to be on our program?  Yeah, I'm not positive at this point.  Yeah, that's Norton.  I'm sorry.  I apologize for him.  You guys wrote a whole little article on those new Calvin Klein underwear, I guess.  Yeah, a couple of quotes from your pals.  You got quotes from Opie and Anthony.  We did.  Made the story.  Yeah, I appreciate it.  Absolutely.  You know, I think the biggest problem is that here's this guy in this advertising, 
[01:27:30]  this model is in this ad, and, you know, if you drive by this billboard in New York,  or if you look at the ad in the magazine, you'll see this thing, and this guy, Schlong,  is absolutely, you know, basically occupying half of the photo.  I think it's beginning to drive guys nuts.  Yeah, because it is mouth-wateringly delicious.  Speak for yourself.  Either way, I'll say that it definitely puts us in a little bit of an insecure place.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah, I think so. 
[01:28:00]  I think now, you know, this guy, you know, Calvin Klein hiring this guy has raised the  standard and raised the bar, if you'll excuse the pun, and all of a sudden we have to look  at this huge thing, and, you know, you know women are starting to size us up more than  ever before.  Well, the girls have confidence in what you've got, yeah.  Girls can say that, too, about the billboards of them and the little nighties and stuff.  Dan, what are you sporting, like four?  Are you starting to think that way already?  As a magazine editor, it's my responsibility to think on behalf of many men, not just myself.  Yeah, okay.  So, look, you know, I think that women, though, I mean, I hate to say this, women are probably 
[01:28:30]  more used to it than guys are, you know?  I'm not used to women staring at my package, you know, or maybe I am, but maybe the average  guy isn't.  I don't know.  You know, we have that fine.  No, you know, I mean, come on.  Put it on a billboard, I don't care.  I'm not going to look at it.  No, it's fine.  Girls' size should matter to women.  Good for you, ladies.  I just think it's funny that we got some really bad quotes in Details Magazine this month.  Oh, we're bad about it.  We're good.  Well, it doesn't make us look good when I'm quoted as saying, my underwear covers up a 
[01:29:00]  world of hurt, and I say Mary-Kate's the prison, Ashley's the goer.  Oh, wait, that was time.  Even better, this time around Aunt Wright's, says, we need a Wonderbra for junk now, adds  Anthony.  Then you take it off and the chick gets all disappointed.  Unless you're wearing cloth-white diapers.  Let me answer your question.  Not cloth-white diapers, you dick.  Do you think it's a good thing to be sized up by women?  Do you, do you, do you, is it important to you that, that, that, do you believe size 
[01:29:30]  matters?  Do you think that women...  I am so confident with my junk that I don't even care.  My junk speaks for itself.  Right.  There you go.  It could do tricks that you can only imagine.  Good to know.  Yeah, size does matter.  You've got to be confident in your mule.  No, you've got to be confident in your mule.  Size matters if you're sporting a two.  Yeah.  If you're over the, uh, the acquired, uh, I'll say six, then who cares?  Yeah, I'm not saying they want a pair of a mule. 
[01:30:00]  If you're over the acquired six, good, but what if there's a guy sporting a ten on a billboard  all over the place?  It makes your six feel a little, uh, a little small.  A spanker.  What a turn-on that is.  Dirty girl.  You know what?  Not if your six could slam dunk, my friend.  If you can't do the job with the six, flip it over.  She'll hurt.  Oh, by the way, I'm...  Yeah, right.  By the way...  Just flip her right over.  Pull it out with a peanut on it. 
[01:30:30]  I'm tired of you.  What do you mean you're confident with your junk?  That really bothers me.  I am very confident.  So am I.  And by the way, I'm not...  Are you confident about that junk?  That's your final junk.  You're very confident, aren't you?  I don't know.  I think guys have been joking about this for ages, and deep down, I'm not sure how confident  everyone is.  By the way, I'm not a six.  That's a little, uh, puny.  Oh, look at it.  Now you're selling it, and it just sounds insincere, Opie.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:31:00]  You're just going to leave it, uh, you know.  I don't want people to think it's a six.  How big do you want it?  So I guess you're right to a point.  Yeah, I mean, look, come on.  I mean, I don't want to have that insecurity.  We all deal with enough crap in our lives to all of a sudden have to worry about that.  I wouldn't worry about it.  You don't think?  Maybe you've got reason to worry.  I don't know.  Like I said, I'm speaking on behalf of men.  But look, come on.  You've seen this ad.  You've seen this guy.  You know, you don't look at that, and you don't raise your eyebrow and think, uh, something's  going on here.  I didn't see it.  It's not the eyebrow that raises it. 
[01:31:30]  Here's the ad.  Here it is.  Jimmy.  There it is.  There it is, Jimmy.  Take a look, Jimmy Norton.  What do you think?  No big deal.  I mean, yeah, he's packing, but he looks like he's got about eight.  Who cares?  His abs are what bother me.  I don't care about his mule.  You're pissed off that he's working out.  Yeah.  It doesn't matter how big my mule is.  My fat just disgusts everyone.  They don't get to the mule.  That's another thing, see?  They vomit.  Yeah, Dan, maybe it's not just the size of his junk there.  It's the whole body.  It may be.  No, no.  Yeah, Jim makes a good point.  Can they stop getting 14-year-old faggots to model these underwear? 
[01:32:00]  And send them to Jim's house?  Yeah, exactly.  I don't know.  All I know is that we spent some time with this guy at Macy's.  He was signing underwear, and apparently he was charging off afterward to be with as  many women as he possibly could.  Really, huh?  Yeah.  And all those fat housewives think they have to stop with the underwear model.  Calvin Klein ad.  You ever autographed a pair of underwear, though?  That's got to be a treat.  Girls.  Girls underwear.  There you go.  Kind of.  I don't know if I was considered an autograph.  It wasn't ink. 
[01:32:30]  I apologized after.  This lady used as evidence against me.  My penmanship was a little floppy.  Jesus.  Didn't last.  Dries up and flakes right off.  It's not rape if you're just dry-humping and covering their mouth.  Oh, God damn, Norton.  Dan, I apologize.  Hey, let me ask you a question.  Do you think guys live outside?  To who?  Yes.  To who?  To who?  To someone who hasn't seen it yet.  In conversation with their buddies. 
[01:33:00]  Talking to some chick on the radio.  How can you lie if it could be proven to be wrong?  Yeah, first of all, why would you lie to your guy friends?  That's just stupid.  And second, why would you lie to a girl?  Because knowing that in the end, she's going to get you.  Yeah, but maybe it's the way you get her.  And by the time you've got her and she notices what's going on, you're already there.  Yeah, you've already got to downplay that part of you and say all the good things you  could do.  Ah.  Oh, that's very deep and sentimental.  They all stuff their bras, you know what I mean?  They stuff their bras, they're lying about their breasts.  Yeah, but who cares? 
[01:33:30]  They take it off.  No, I don't please.  Yeah, who cares?  Yeah, they take it off and you're good.  Yeah, good to go.  Who cares?  All right there, Dan.  I'd love to continue this thrilling conversation about man's junk.  I think we have two beautiful girls from Long Island here that are ready to come in in  their lingerie, their naughty 90s.  Oh, I can see that taking priority.  Yes.  All right, Dan.  So, yeah, the latest issue of details.  Got a couple quotes from Opie and Anthony in there.  We're liking it.  Thanks for your help, you guys.  I appreciate it.  Keep us in mind there, Dan.  You got it. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, we have a lot of opinions.  We have stupid opinions, even dumber than the ones you read in this month's.  All right.  Well, we'll count on you for more.  If you need to dumb down that magazine, we're your guys.  Will you come back on our show, Dan?  Absolutely.  I'd love to.  We always ask the first-timers because a lot of them get scared.  Yeah.  I'm all right.  You're all right?  And I'm enjoying the picture of Joe Namath on the sideline and his cute fur coat.  You liking the mink?  Oh, my God.  I had one just like it.  It's all good. 
[01:34:30]  1973.  An injured Joe Namath swaps pigskin for bunny skin in 1973.  He looks ridiculous.  He was a good quarterback, man.  All right.  Thanks a lot, you guys.  All right, Dan.  Thanks.  Take care.  Bye.  That is cold.  Goes down.  Wow.  Ma'am, where's your body?  What do we got there?  Ma'am, where's yours?  You're not in the contest?  No, I'm not.  I'm just here to drive her.  You're just support?  Yeah.  She's my friend.  I was going to do it.  My boyfriend had a little problem.  He did?  I'm naked.  Yeah, but you're not going to be naked.  You're not really naked.  And look at how lovely your friend looks. 
[01:35:00]  It's a trip to hedonism.  Thank you.  Which is where?  Huh?  Can you tell us a little bit about that?  Hedonism is Jamaica, I think.  No, it is Jamaica.  It's someplace warm.  That's all I'm going to do.  Yeah, it's very warm.  Very nice.  And you become a star because people will be checking you out all over the country.  It's Melanie and the Naughty Nighty Anthony and her friend Lauren.  Nice.  Very, very nice.  What is that, Vickie's?  Actually, it's Fredericks of Hollywood.  It's Fredericks.  A little sluttier Fredericks.  Yeah.  I like that.  Could you back up just a tad? 
[01:35:30]  Because we can't get a good view of you.  Turn around.  Wow.  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  She's got that nice.  That's a song.  Wow.  She's got that nice tattoo right above the blue knot.  Can you lift that so I can see the tattoo?  Oh, yeah.  Lift that so I can see the tattoo on the back.  That's some nice tattoo work.  Nice.  Very good.  Oh, my God.  How old a gal are you?  I'm 19 years old.  Yes.  I was going to say teen.  No, no, no, no, 19.  Wow.  We're restocking our teens on the Opie and Anthony show.  And she has golden locks.  Yeah. 
[01:36:00]  Something tells me the rug matches the curtains in that.  There is no rug.  Oh, my wood floor.  Teen wood floor.  That's it.  I really want to rub my face all over the foyer.  See, this is now why tighty-whities, as they call them, better than boxes.  Right now, your knees are a little damp, aren't they?  I wouldn't care.  Please.  I'll have to squeeze it and show it to you.  That's fine.  That's okay there.  Jimmy Norton. 
[01:36:30]  Very nice.  Well, very, very nice.  Did Stinky do a good job with the photographs?  He did a very good job.  Very good job.  Stinky, you better.  What poses did he put you in?  No, she did her own.  I did my own kind of lying down.  Yeah?  On the new Ikea furniture?  Yeah, nice Ikea furniture.  Yeah, you like that.  Nice Ikea furniture.  Nice.  I'm one, like, sitting on the chair.  It's not too bad.  I wasn't too comfortable.  All right.  Very good.  I must say, can I say, Opie?  Finalist?  I think we have a finalist here.  I absolutely think we got a finalist right here.  She has one of the nicest hineys I've ever seen. 
[01:37:00]  Were you looking at that, Norton?  Do you want me to see it again?  Yeah, please.  The whole package is nice.  You don't have to walk far away.  Oh, my.  It bugs me.  It's perfect.  Very nice.  It is a perfect hiney.  Stinky, where will the pictures be up?  I guess later today.  Stinky, how about you bust a little head and get it up immediately?  Rick would bust some head.  Rick would definitely bust some head.  He may be a pain in the ass, but he had those pictures up by now.  Don't worry.  Rick has plenty of shortcomings, which we will go through when we're on the phone with him. 
[01:37:30]  I'm sure he'll show them.  But when it comes to photographing girls, he knows his stuff.  Is Scott here so you can put them up?  Seriously?  Okay, then they'll be up.  Did you get the hiney, Garrett?  Yeah.  You got a good hiney shot?  Make sure Scott writes 19-year-old Melanie.  19.  That means a lot to the listeners.  Or just teen.  Teen Melanie.  When's your birthday?  My birthday is on Thanksgiving.  Oh.  Oh, so before Thanksgiving, you were how old?  18.  18.  You're going to be invited to many teen parties between now and Thanksgiving. 
[01:38:00]  Yes, if we ever do a teen event here, you're cordially invited.  Thank you.  When?  I don't know.  I've been saying.  Jesus Christ.  We need another teen event.  Would you show up for maybe teen pajama party or?  Absolutely.  Teen?  Absolutely.  Anything.  We both would show up for now.  Oh, how old a gal are you?  19 as well.  Two teens.  The brunette is just as hot.  I'm so bummed she's not in the naughty 90.  Where's your boyfriend?  Can we talk him into it?  No.  No.  How come your boyfriend didn't get that? 
[01:38:30]  I don't have any.  Oh, that's the answer.  Jimmy Norton was going.  God damn, Norton.  I'm just trying to find out.  Oh, shut up.  I'm too old for her.  I'm too old for her.  Yeah, sure.  I'm 33.  That's too old, right?  Not for her, actually.  Hey.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Nice.  And I have cash.  You're looking for that father figure, are you?  I got a bad grade.  It's all right.  Oh, Jesus.  You want to produce a foundling? 
[01:39:00]  Foundling.  Ah, you're horrible, man.  That's my new favorite word.  A foundling.  Foundling.  Someone said it's Stalker Patty's website, foundlingmusic.com.  All right, so her pictures will be up.  You guys can hang, you know.  You're definitely going to enjoy these pictures.  I think I'm going to put my clothes back on.  All right.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Oh, wait.  Don't we have something?  Oh, I'm sorry.  They can't hang on.  All right.  Well, she can put her clothes back on.  They can't.  Oh.  As they walk out the door. 
[01:39:30]  Beautiful.  Oh, by the way, she gets a prize for being the first Naughty Nighty today.  That ass depresses me.  It doesn't even turn me on.  It makes me just want to blow my fat head off.  Why?  It just, when I see something that sexy, it doesn't, it's like it turns you on initially,  and then you're like, I suck.  I really do just want to pinch my fat.  You just pinch her fat.  Beat that, Philly.  Beat that one.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  You got to go to this.  What an ass she has.  What an ass.  The cities will be battling it out for the Naughty Nighty crown, Anthony. 
[01:40:00]  Beat that one, Philly.  Her ass looked as smooth and white and soft as Norton's belly.  Yeah.  And just like a nice piece of alabaster.  She said cut.  No, I didn't mean that.  I wasn't double entendre.  I wasn't being like, you know, drop that letter.  Oh, I thought you dumped.  Did you dump?  I dumped because I thought he said.  No, he said it has a better cut.  Cut.  Like she's cut better than.  How about you pronounce your words?  I'm busy. 
[01:40:30]  I'm horny.  I'm busy.  Doing a little.  Wow.  There you go.  Ladies, come on down.  The contest has just begun.  And when we broadcast live from Philly, you Philly ladies just have to show up at the station between 3 and 7.  Oh, did you put your pictures live in Philly?  Did you put your clothes back on?  I think so.  Because I was going to.  I forgot the stinky cam.  We could have at least put a quick shot up.  What an ass.  We could show the fans.  Yeah, do that.  Do that.  She needs to do that. 
[01:41:00]  We'll get something up on the stinky cam for you.  Yes.  Purvy's out there.  Poor people that have to wait now at home.  Anthony, I'm up on opanthony.com.  I should also mention that Boston, Cleveland, Buffalo, and Washington all in on the Naughty  Nighty contest.  It's a little confusing.  Yeah.  But between the hours at 3 and 7 when we're broadcasting, you just have to show up at the studio in your city.  And we have people standing by with a digital camera to get your pictures in your Naughty Nighty contest.  Naughty Nighty.  And then they're going to email us all the pictures so you can be in on the contest. 
[01:41:30]  See how easy we make it for you?  This is the first time we've tried to make one of these contests open to just about everyone.  Yes.  Or as many people as possible.  So, once again, in Boston, Cleveland, Buffalo, or Washington, all you have to do is show up at the station we're broadcasting on between 3 and 7 when we're on the air.  And they'll take your pictures as well.  Okay?  Yes.  All right.  Where is she?  She's cheap.  What happened?  Oh.  She changed and now she's changed.  Oh, wow. 
[01:42:00]  That was quick.  I don't know.  Put her in front of the stinky cam.  Yeah, we need her in front of the stinky cam for...  There she is.  All right.  What shot are we going to get?  Probably the butt with her.  Yeah.  Back up a little.  Over the shoulder look with that butt.  Yeah, back up just a tad.  Lower the camera a little bit there.  Do we need better lighting yet?  Keep going.  There you go.  We need light, though?  Right there.  No.  No.  We'll see in a second.  Let me get...  Lift that back.  Yeah, lift the back.  Oh, yes.  There you go. 
[01:42:30]  All right.  It's got to focus a little bit, Stinky.  Just trying to help the people out here.  Just trying to help.  A little focus.  Your friend's going to be all over the country in about...  Getting better or worse.  Wow.  That's a nice...  A little worse.  Go a little more, a little more, a little more.  Oh, my goodness.  Wait.  She's got to look at the camera again.  No, no.  It's bad now.  All right.  Go the other way.  Hold it.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  Right there.  Wait.  She's got to look over her shoulder.  Are you smiling?  Because you got a great shot here.  We just had to refocus the camera.  Okay.  There we go.  That's it. 
[01:43:00]  Let me see what you got.  Are you happy with it, Ant?  Yeah, that'll work.  Four, three.  The update's in two, one.  It's about the same shot.  Her butt doesn't look as good in this shot.  I mean, it's a great butt.  She needs a little more of a side shot.  Yeah, a little side shot.  A little side.  Not dead on ass.  Not dead on ass shot.  I think that shot takes away from the actual...  Yeah.  Like that.  There you go.  All right.  Hold on.  That's it.  Smile.  You just stay right there.  There it is.  Don't move.  Holy smoke.  Turn around, Ant. 
[01:43:30]  Let me see.  Actually, in five.  It'll update in four, three, two.  Let me see on mine.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's the shot.  You can go to the stinky cam to get the picture of Teen Melanie.  Wow.  Rose right there.  Teen Melanie.  Beautiful.  There you go.  Very good.  And then her real pictures for the contest will be up on opandanthony.com.  Jessica, what's up?  Oh, my God.  I'm on air.  What?  Yes, you're on air.  You're on air, yes.  I'm sorry.  I'm driving down 66. 
[01:44:00]  That would be in Virginia, I believe, Anthony.  I live in northern Virginia.  Hey.  On local reference, Ant.  Yes.  Need to get more...  What was that?  We need to get more local references, Ant.  I live in Falkyre.  What?  Falkyre County.  The county's right here.  Oh, okay.  Three to one.  All right.  I thought you were telling us to go Falk or something.  No.  Falk.  No, no, no.  All right.  If you take the F and the first A out, you get A, Quirre County. 
[01:44:30]  Okay.  All right.  I wanted to know when you guys were...  I've been saying it for years.  Jessica, I know what you're going to say.  We're not...  We've got to work out the details as far as going down to Washington.  But if you show up at WJFK's studios while we're on the air, they will take your pictures  of the Naughty Nighty Contest.  They'll email us the picture and you'll be in on the contest.  Okay.  So just do that.  Okay.  Just to guarantee that you're in, okay?  Okay.  If you need more details for anyone out there, go to opianthony.com. 
[01:45:00]  Thank you, Jessica.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  That groan was just Norton looking at the stinky cam picture.  And these pictures, as good as these pictures are, they don't do it justice.  And these are good shots.  It's just...  It bugs me.  It's so nice.  Yeah.  Ugh.  And with that, we should take a break.  Yeah.  Go to the stinky cam on opianthony.com.  Check it out yourself.  I wonder...  I guess we could ask Rick.  I wonder if any of the other cities have gotten any contestants yet.  I don't know.  I'd like to know.  I would like to know.  Look at all the thank yous.  Oh, my God, thank you. 
[01:45:30]  Thank you.  Bounce a quarter off that ass.  Teen Melanie looks like the same Pauly girl.  Yeah, there you go.  Pauly F, bring her to Philly when you come.  My God, I could spend hours rubbing some out to that great teen ass.  I'll say it again.  Nice ass.  I'll say it again.  To Boston, Cleveland, Buffalo, and Washington, and Philly.  Beat that.  Beat that.  Check her ID.  She looks about 16.  Isn't it amazing the reaction an ass gives you? 
[01:46:00]  To me, there's nothing that gives a stronger reaction to a man than a nice ass.  Nothing.  You're saying the obvious.  But I mean, it doesn't even just make you...  I feel it physically in my chest and my stomach.  Oh, my God.  There's the money shot.  I'm gay, and look...  I like the look of that ass.  Look at that.  Oh, Joe's checking in.  Joe.  Hey.  Joe runs the board up in Boston for us, Anthony.  Right.  Hey, man.  And he's got some bad news.  Go ahead, Joe.  No women.  No women.  I'm waiting.  No women have shown up at WBCN Studios in Boston. 
[01:46:30]  Nada.  All right.  You're going to get your ass kicked by New York and all the other cities.  That's fine.  We're going to kick Pittsburgh's ass.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  All right.  Ladies in the Boston area, just go down to the studio with your naughty 90, and you'll  be in on the contest.  We've got people standing by with digital cameras.  Right.  All right.  Hey, what are we giving the girl for showing up?  Teen Melanie.  Samsung DVD player.  She's getting the Samsung DVD player.  Look at that. 
[01:47:00]  Look at that.  I just see Earl carrying that under his arm.  It reminds me of a riot or something.  I don't know.  An appliance.  Ring the bell.  Sorry, Earl.  Sorry, Earl.  We didn't mean to say that.  It's not like we're playing the Johnny Rebel CD.  Oh, that's right.  We were doing it earlier.  Oh, God.  That was awful.  Rick came up with some CD.  Johnny Rebel.  It's just all anti-black songs with the most heinous language in it.  And there it was blasting on the computer in the office, and Earl's standing there listening. 
[01:47:30]  The sickest part was it was pretty melodic.  It kind of sticks in your head.  Well, they all start like, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow, bow.  A bunch of country music.  Yeah.  Wholesome.  Yeah.  Anthony, the trip is for two to Hedonism 3.  Mm-hmm.  Um, who's she bringing?  Who is she bringing to Hedonism 3?  Because, I'll tell you, I think that's the winner right there. 
[01:48:00]  Contest?  It's still an early contest.  Oh, yeah, I tell you.  Contest on.  Contest on.  How do you beat that alabaster, honey?  Eric, what's up?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I'm a new listener, and I just want to say I got two hours before I get home to take a look at this.  But, uh, you think this girl is worthy of a well-doggie or what?  Yes, definitely, Eric.  Yeah.  If we can get one out for her.  Yeah, we'll do that for you.  All right.  Thank you.  All the doggies.  Keith, very pissed. 
[01:48:30]  I'm still waiting for the Tyson story, you tools.  Oh.  Well, we're distracted.  Naughty-90s.  Naughty-90s.  Naughty-90s.  We got the remix, the Buddy Epson little remix we did the other day.  Yeah, I did.  This is really Buddy Epson doing some weird well-doggie song, and then, I don't know,  we mixed in some porn music and some moaning, and it turned out like this.  Why don't I get up here and let the people hear it?  Use it or lose it.  I, uh, I don't like it, so. 
[01:49:00]  I, uh, well, doggies.  Well, doggies.  Well, doggies.  Well, doggies.  Yeah, doggies.  Yeah, doggies.  Yeah, doggies.  Yeah, doggies.  Oh, doggies.  Oh, doggies.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't like it, so.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:49:30]  I'm sorry.  Well, I usually use that for my cat offline.  Hey, well, doggies to you.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's like listening to Corky and Cara Ann Quinlan.  Opie and Anthony.  I'd rather hear my penis in a vice than listen to those two.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  And we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027. 
[01:50:00]  Anywhere else, 866-2774.  Wow.  Let's go to Frank real fast.  Frank, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  This girl is smoking.  Team Melanie.  Pictures are up now.  They are?  Yeah.  Are they good pictures?  Oh, yeah.  Go to Opie and Anthony.com for the latest contestant in the Naughty Nighty contest.  Model good looking.  My computer looks like a glazed donut.  Oh, man.  You guys done good.  Real good-er. 
[01:50:30]  Oh, yeah.  Shot two looks very good.  And shot three, that ass.  Let me apologize to Stinky.  Stinky.  Stinky, come back in here.  Stinky did good.  She's kind of giving the whale eye a little bit in picture three.  That's good.  You just want to...  You just want to, like, what, smack her?  No, I'm kidding.  Of course.  Stinky?  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  I was wrong.  The pictures are up?  Yeah.  And you did a great job.  Thank you, Opie.  I was so wrong to doubt your talent. 
[01:51:00]  Whose idea of the lounge on the couch thing?  Was that her pose?  The lay down on the couch?  Yeah.  No, that was, like, the first one.  Oh, that was kind of you?  You said lay down.  Lay down.  Yeah.  Lay down.  And then what about in the blue chair where her legs are straight, fishnet stocking?  That was her friend.  Her friend said do that.  And what about shot three?  Is that the turn around shot?  She's turning around, giving me the over-the-shoulder look.  That ass of hers just peeking out from beneath the naughty-nighty. 
[01:51:30]  That was all me.  That was all you.  Not bad.  Well, Stinky, that's great.  Not enough close-ups, but not bad.  Yeah, how many pictures did you take in total?  Six or seven.  And why aren't they all up?  Man, he has a lot of confidence in his picture-taking.  I just needed six pictures to capture the moment.  I know.  50% of them made the board.  Very nice.  Baseball cap and your little brown locks.  All right, ladies, it's not too late.  You have another hour and a half to get down to the studios here in New York with your naughty-nighty. 
[01:52:00]  Teen Melanie, her pictures are up, and they look great.  Philly, we're coming Friday, so all you Philly ladies, open invite to just show up at the station between 3 and 7 when we're broadcasting live,  and you can be in on the naughty-nighty contest as well, okay?  Yes.  I bet the inside of those little white linen things you wear are all damp, Anthony.  Yes.  Your little...  All right.  What are they pinned with?  Those little woodpins? 
[01:52:30]  You're a messed-up F.  Hey, did they find Tyson?  I don't know.  I honestly don't know if they found him.  We were supposed to talk about Tyson about two hours ago, but he was running loose in Manhattan, and quite frankly, we're not brave.  We're a bunch of pussies, and we want to make sure that he's been captured before we discuss the Tyson incident that happened today, right?  Make sure he's captured.  Captured.  Hopefully, they shot him with a dart gun, and he's back in his cage. 
[01:53:00]  All right.  Look, man.  Let's shut off the computer so we can talk about Tyson.  Well, I was going through the other contestants.  Perf!  He can't even...  Yeah.  You see a girl's elbow, you're done for an hour.  You are perverted.  Refocus.  Refocus.  The old crook of the arm, you loop up.  You've done that?  Yeah, he's right there.  While they're making muscles.  The last we heard, Tyson was running rampant down 6th Avenue. 
[01:53:30]  After he punched Lennox Lewis, he stepped up to the podium.  I saw the videotape.  Yeah, they were doing one of those press conferences there.  Press conference to announce the fight.  It's supposed to be in April, in Vegas.  And I saw them both.  Lewis was on one of the podiums.  It was like on a little platform.  And Tyson was stepping onto his.  He stepped on it and kept going.  Stepped right over it and walked up to Lewis and pulls his arm back to hit him. 
[01:54:00]  People all of a sudden jump in.  You see Mike Tyson kind of go down out of the picture a little,  which is when he supposedly bit Lennox Lewis on the ankle.  Which, at that point, ripped his shoe and sock off, from what I hear.  Because Lewis said he didn't have a sock on after that.  I think it was Lennox Lewis where Tyson said, I'll eat you and your children.  He goes, I want your heart. 
[01:54:30]  I will eat your children.  I will eat your children.  Yeah.  So, he's insane.  Well, the obvious thing, first of all, a lot of people were thinking, well, is it just, you know, pre-fight hype?  A little publicity stunt.  Was this kind of like a WWF thing?  And so far, all the people that were close on the scene there said, no, this is legit.  He lost his effing mind.  Yeah.  It was apparent because Lennox Lewis and his people are not actors. 
[01:55:00]  And they were completely shocked and stunned when this happened.  And then, the funniest part of the whole thing, after this incident, he left wherever they were having the press conference and started running.  He ran out and started running down 6th Avenue in Manhattan.  Just a wild man toward the Empire State Building.  Please remain calm.  He is running toward the Empire State Building. 
[01:55:30]  He has a blonde, I believe that's T. Melanie, in his head.  You'll be safe.  Just try to stay away from him.  We have police and fire trucks after him now.  Don't shoot at him.  It just makes him angry.  He's, last I heard, running wild down the streets.  We have a tape of him? 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, we have a tape.  Because I got to hear some of these clips.  He, before he ran out, he started yelling at some of the people in the audience.  Imagine being this guy.  Because he pointed at one guy and he's just bitching at him.  The guy must have just left fluid in his chair.  Because, you know, another guy just bit Lennox Lewis through punches at people.  You don't know if he's going to jump down in the crowd and kill you.  By the way, before we continue with this little segment, I just want to announce to the 18 cities that listen to us  that Anthony does an incredible, and I mean, dead on Mike Tyson impression. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, yes, you are.  It's Opie doing it.  No, no, no, no.  Because Mike Tyson is in New York today.  A lot of people know I do a lot of good voices, but Mike Tyson's not one of them, my friend.  Mike Tyson.  All right, here's Mike Tyson going nuts.  All right, let's hear it.  You can't touch me.  You're not man enough.  I'll eat your ass on the line, you bitch.  How many anybody in here can't fuck with this? 
[01:57:00]  This is the ultimate, man.  You, you hoe.  Come and tell me my face.  I'm fucking ass for everybody.  You bitch.  Come on, you bitch.  You're a sad coward.  You're not man enough for the with me.  You can't lack two minutes in my world, bitch.  Look at you scared now, you hoe.  Scared like a little white bitch.  Scared of the real man.  I'll fuck you till you love me, bitch.  Oh, yes!  Dude, I would have crapped my pants.  I'll F you till you love me. 
[01:57:30]  That's what he just said.  I'll F you till you love me.  And before that, he said, I'll F you in front of everybody.  In front of everybody.  You little white bitch, did he say?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, you know.  I'm sure that won't even make the papers.  No, I'm sure it won't.  Wait, I got to hear that clip again.  That is fantastic, Mike Tyson.  At the beginning, it's just pandemonium, but then they kind of get the mic near him.  Yeah.  Genius.  Let's hear it again.  Oh, man.  You can't touch me.  You can't touch me. 
[01:58:00]  You're not man enough.  Eat your ass on the line, you bitch.  Oh, anybody in here can't fuck with this.  This is the horseman, man.  Fuck you, you hoe.  Come and say in my face.  Fuck you, you hoe for everybody, you bitch.  Come on, you bitch.  You're scared, coward.  You've not man enough for fuck with me.  You can't lack two minutes in my world, bitch.  Look at you scared now, you hoe.  Scared like a little white bitch.  Scared of the real man.  I'll fuck you till you love me.  Fuck.  That must have been exactly what the rapes sounded like. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, yeah.  Anthony?  I'll fuck you until you love me.  Anthony?  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I was playing the wrong clip.  That's actual audio from Oz last night.  Was that an episode of Oz from last night?  I'm sorry.  We'll find the title.  It's part of the love story.  The love story.  I'll fuck you until you love me.  I'll fuck you until you love me.  Come on, who the real man now, you bitch? 
[01:59:00]  You white bitch?  Come on, you can't last in my world.  My world entails a big black thing going right in there.  Wow.  Oof.  I'm nowhere near the scene and I'm freaking out.  Can you imagine Tyson saying that to you?  Oscar, what's up?  Yo, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, I just heard it over the police scanner.  The army and the Navy are going to try to drive Godzilla and Mothra into Manhattan to deal with Tyson.  He's on his way.  The help is on the way, guys.  Hang in there.  Thank you, Oscar. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, come over here, Godzilla.  I'm going to F you.  I'm going to F you.  Bring it on, you little green bitch.  I will F you up.  I wish the beep were on the same channel as all these sounds, because then I could say  the F words with a beep.  We'll have to work on that.  Yes, we will, you bitch.  Don't make me come over here.  Oh, that's okay.  Brian, what's up? 
[02:00:00]  Hey, man.  It's frigging Tyson.  The guy's like the Incredible Hulk, only he never changes back to Bruce Banner.  There we go.  Don't make me angry.  You don't like me when I'm angry.  Oh, wait a minute.  I'm already angry.  Let me bite you and punch you.  You know what it was?  I'm getting a bad rap on this one.  When we came out and the curtains opened, all of a sudden there was a lot of flash photography  and it got me upset.  Like it was flashing.  And I believe I did hear somebody say, don't take pictures. 
[02:00:30]  You're getting them all nervous.  But I kept seeing.  They kept flashing and flashing the pictures.  So I broke my chains and I went out and bit a subway car in half.  But you can't blame me towards beauty and kill the beast.  We all remember this clip from Tyson.  I'm on the Zoloft thing, right?  But I'm on that to keep me from killing y'all.  Yeah, that makes perfect sense.  I'm on the Zoloft to keep from killing y'all. 
[02:01:00]  But when I get taken off it by my managers before fight time, look out.  I'll rampage.  I'm heading toward the Empire State Building.  That's a short little climb.  I'm going to find me a blonde and get up there until they send the biplanes after me to shoot at me.  But I swat them down like nothing.  Come on, biplanes.  Come on, you little bitches.  I will F you.  That is probably the best Tyson clip ever. 
[02:01:30]  Do you want to hear it again?  I have to hear it again.  All right.  Well, let's hear the other two clips.  They're real short, I guess.  Tyson pre-fight.  I don't even know what this is.  Why don't we hear it real fast?  Go ahead.  I'll kick Lennox with a motherf***ing hand.  You want to hear that one again?  Yeah, yeah.  I'll kick Lennox with a motherf***ing hand.  I don't even know what he's saying.  I'll kick Lennox Lewis' motherf***ing ass.  Oh, okay.  And this one. 
[02:02:00]  Lennox Lewis, I want his kids.  Oh, daddy.  Are you okay, dad?  Yeah.  Talking about Lewis' kids.  Right.  Lennox Lewis, come here.  I'm going to f*** you.  I'm going to f*** you in the f***.  Come here, white boy.  I'll f*** you right here.  Who was the guy he was yelling at?  Oh, my God.  It was some, I guess, reporter. 
[02:02:30]  Good.  It was somebody in front of the stage.  There was someone next to Lewis, and he went right after him.  White boy?  And it was a white guy.  He went right after everyone.  Throwing some racial epithets out.  I wish it was Mushnick.  Wouldn't that have been good?  How the hell?  But he'll get...  It won't be...  Maybe it was Chuck Zito?  Yeah.  Oh, he's a Hell's Angels guy.  He's on Oz.  Jesus.  You want to hear that first one?  Yeah, let's hear the first one again.  You can't touch me. 
[02:03:00]  You're not man enough.  Eat your a** on the line, you b***h.  Oh, anybody in here can f*** with this man.  This is the ultimate, man.  F*** you, you ho.  Come and say, my face, I'm f***ing your a** for everybody.  You b***h.  Come on, you b***h.  You're a scared coward.  You've got man enough to f*** with me.  You can't lack two minutes in my world, b***h. 
[02:03:30]  Look at you scared now, you ho.  Scared like a little white b***h.  Scared of the real man.  I'll f*** you till you love me, f***.  I usually reserve that language for my first date.  I will f*** you till you love me, b***h.  You're going to love me.  I will punch you in the face, you f***ing whore.  Now you love me?  No?  All right.  I'm going to have to tear it till it bleeds. 
[02:04:00]  Jim from Vegas checking in.  Jim.  What's good, guys?  You're killing me.  Hey, Jim.  The guy in Tyson's camp in the blue camouflage, he runs up like he's going to get into it,  and then when he sees those real punches being thrown, he kind of peers back to the back  of the crowd there.  Yeah, there's not many men that'll get involved with that.  He said, oh, those are all real punches, man.  I'll show you the real man.  I'll show you the real man.  Hello, this is Mike Tyson. 
[02:04:30]  If you're constipated, I will come to your house and give that same speech.  You will not be constipated no more.  That will come out instantaneously.  Instantaneously.  F-O-C-R-L-Y-T.  You're going to tell me that's not how to spell it?  That's how the real man spell it.  I will f*** you till you love me.  That is one of the best lines ever.  Ever.  I will f*** you till you love me. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, that is the best Tyson impression I've ever heard in my life.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, yeah.  Stop, Jimmy.  ESPN website said that a reporter yelled, you should be, oh, you should be in a straitjacket.  That seems to be what said him.  The reporter should be in a straitjacket for saying that out loud.  You're going to say that to that guy?  I love Tyson.  This makes me love him more and want him to be champion again.  This is what I want a boxer to be like, a maniac.  Right.  Don't be mistaken here. 
[02:05:30]  This is the Tyson we want to see.  It's the Tyson we love.  Anytime this stuff happens, the reporters love it.  People love it.  That guy said he should be in a straitjacket.  Hey, he should be.  But you love watching it.  Oh, and we're getting more reports.  Of course, Tyson is supposedly still loose in the city somewhere.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Dave, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Hey, I just heard on CNN, apparently he's on a scaffolding outside of a building that's  under construction.  Yeah.  He's throwing barrels at some cops. 
[02:06:00]  The cops are trying to climb up the ladders.  We don't have a confirmation yet.  I believe there's one guy, Mario.  Mario somebody.  We don't have confirmation on his last name yet.  Mario's a little bitch.  I see him tell you.  He's trying to come up.  I'm throwing barrels down on him.  That's right.  And it plays all 80s video game music as I do it.  But he's a bitch.  Little Mario.  Come here, Mario.  I'll show you the real man.  I'll throw barrels down on you.  He's jumping over the barrels, Mike.  All right.  Have a good one, guys. 
[02:06:30]  All right, Dave.  He keeps jumping over, but I keep throwing him down.  I'll get him.  He ain't going to get up here.  That fucking bitch.  Ray's checking in.  Ray, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, guys.  It's on the news.  The city is scheduling aerial spraying of Zoloft in the parks and sewers.  Hey, I'll tell you what.  When they catch him, though, they should fly him down to that prison in Cuba where they're in open cages.  It'll scare the crap out of the prisoners.  What does that mean?  Yeah, they don't think they're being treated right. 
[02:07:00]  Send Tyson down there for a little pep talk.  Hello, Taliban.  Now, the first lesson, I'm going to ask you till you love me.  Now, bend over.  I'm going to do it right through the open chain link fence houses you're living in with your sorry ass.  And then I got an invite to see that John Walker guy.  He got a cute mouth.  M-O-U-F.  Mouth.  I spelled that right.  Sure, that's how you spell it.  That's right, you ****.  I know.  That's exactly how you spell it. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah, crocodile hunting should be brought up.  He's a squirrely one.  Got me tranquilizer darts.  That just pissed me off there, Aussie.  Now I'm going to F you till you love me.  What would you do, seriously, if Tyson walked through that door right now?  Get a picture with him.  I crap myself.  Picture with him?  Yeah.  I crap myself.  I love Tyson.  I crap myself.  I love him.  You would crap himself because you make fun of him. 
[02:08:00]  I don't.  It's not making fun.  It's an homage.  I would go through that studio window.  Yeah.  Pray for the best and hopefully make the corner before he does.  I would get you.  Yeah, you would.  If you think you're getting away from Mike Tyson, I'll find you.  Unless they take me back to Skull Island and lock me up behind a big wooden barricade.  I was happy there.  Fighting the dinosaurs.  The jungle people leaving bitches for me to F until they love me.  Then I would eat them. 
[02:08:30]  Then they had to take me to New York and chain me up and take pictures of me and scare me.  That's why I climbed the Empire State Building.  I'm so misunderstood.  Misunderstood.  LT5H.  Well, sure.  LT5H.  Yeah, look.  It says it right here in my thesaurus.  Very good.  Holy S.  Mike.  Hey, what's up?  How are you?  Hey, bud.  Yo, right in the beginning of that clip, he says, I will eat your a-hole. 
[02:09:00]  No, what?  Does he?  I swear to God.  Swear to God.  I got to hear it.  All right, let's listen for that.  There's a little Easter egg in there.  A little Easter egg.  Let's listen for I will eat your a-hole.  Go ahead.  You can't touch me.  You can't touch me.  You're not man enough.  I'll eat your a-hole on the line, you bitch.  Anybody in here can't f*** with me.  This is the ultimate, man. 
[02:09:30]  You f*** you, you hoe.  Come and say in my face, I'm f***ing you a-hole for everybody.  You bitch.  Come on, you bitch.  You're scared, coward.  You got man enough to f*** with me.  You can't lack two minutes in my world, bitch.  Look at you scared now, you hoe.  Scared like a little white f***.  Scared of the real man.  I'll f*** you till you love me, f***.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  I will eat your a-hole in front of everyone. 
[02:10:00]  Oh, that's a man.  It's a delicacy in China.  Yeah, I'm sure.  The a-hole is lightly marinated in teriyaki.  In teriyaki.  Or soy sauce.  I get them confusing.  And then you must bread the a-hole and fry it.  And it's wonderful.  It's like Cal and Mary.  That is what we love.  We want to see Tyson out of his mind. 
[02:10:30]  Now they're saying that the fight might not happen because of this.  It's all about now.  The fight is happening.  They're saying the boxing commission can just say, no, get out of here.  This is what boxing needs.  How great is this?  They'll take the money and run.  This is perfect.  They'll find a way to spin it.  This fight has to happen now.  Now they got all the hype they ever could dream of.  Now I guess I'll have to spend my time hunting for Marky Mark.  In the spaceship.  On your knees. 
[02:11:00]  On your feet.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  At the end of the clip, you're missing the best part.  Huh?  He says, I'll F you till you love me, faggot.  I heard that.  We've been talking about that.  It's a great line.  That one we heard.  We didn't hear the other one.  I'll eat your a-hole.  I didn't hear faggot.  Did he say faggot?  Yeah, he said faggot at the end.  Yeah.  All right, Jim, thank you.  You guys rule.  All right.  I just saw the clip a few times without the sound.  And then you can see his mouth going faggot and the F word. 
[02:11:30]  He is mad.  Charles, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Forget the Zolo.  At the next press conference, they got a little sky on a Hannibal Lecter and a straight jacket and a muzzle.  He's insane.  He is insane.  Okay, guys.  All right.  Actually, this was a tape from my wedding night with Robin Givens.  It was my wedding tape.  First, we danced. 
[02:12:00]  And then she danced with her father.  And then that's what I said to her.  I'll ask you till you love me.  I'll eat your a-holes.  She kind of liked that part, though.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey, Matt.  That second sound clip, the short one, did Tyson start talking about Lennox Lewis' kids again?  Yeah.  Because he's a friggin' moron, guys.  Lennox Lewis doesn't have any children.  Well, why don't you tell Mike that? 
[02:12:30]  Matt.  Hey, you know what?  Fine.  Yeah, imagine that you're at the, you're one of those stupid reporters.  Oh, by the way, Mike, Lennox doesn't have any.  It's great to see a reporter get screamed at.  Some little snotty sports writer.  Click, click, click, click.  You ought to be in a straight jacket.  Oh, boy, did he probably wet himself.  All right.  Oh, another girl here for the Naughty Ninety contest, Anthony.  Oh.  Wonderful. 
[02:13:00]  Anthony, I love that Mike Tyson impression.  Seriously, it gets me every time.  I love it.  It's a character.  Especially when he tries to spell and stuff.  I just do a character.  Like Mr. Imus.  It's a character.  Yeah, we could go to the FU line after that.  Why not?  Naughty Ninety.  We'll meet our latest contestant next.  Also, also, Stalker Patty Cribs.  Yes.  We'll check in with Rick, Steve, and Stalker Patty to see where they are as they head to 
[02:13:30]  Staten Island for Stalker Patty Cribs today.  All right?  Cool.  FU line.  Hey, thanks for calling.  And here's the Opie to Anthony.  FU line.  Yeah, I want to send a big FU out to all you stinking Ranger fans.  I thought you were going to do something this year.  You can have that Catholic concussion faggot Lindros.  You're not going to make the playoffs now.  How's it feel from going from first to fourth place, faggots?  Your best bet is to go across state to the island, become an Islander fan, jump on their 
[02:14:00]  bandwagon.  They've got a better chance of making the playoffs.  You guys suck.  Next message.  This FU goes out to the makers of Grand Theft Auto 3 for the Game Boy.  They were supposed to have it released today, but they didn't.  And now it's not going to get released until October 18th.  What the hell are we supposed to do waiting another nine months?  FU.  Next message.  I'd like to give a big FU to my soon-to-be ex-roommate.  You steal my stuff, you eat all my food, and you're an effing slob.  And you know how I know all this?  Because I take the effing lock on your bedroom door, bitch. 
[02:14:30]  You're just a lazy lying C, and I can't wait till you're gone.  FU.  End of message.  The Opie and Anthony FU line is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks to be me.  Call anytime.  212-830-3785.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And E.W.  Here, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  There's the video of Tyson.  They just showed it on CNN. 
[02:15:00]  Too late.  God damn it.  They're showing it a lot, though.  Calling out the sports reporter.  They're starting to say it might be Russ Salzberg.  Yeah.  Ouch.  Local sportscaster, Russ Salzberg.  Yeah.  FU till you love me.  They just showed the clip.  I swear to God, it looks like he should be shaking branches around and running around throwing things.  Great.  It's just a madman.  And you heard in that clip how angry he was. 
[02:15:30]  Like, he's breathing heavy.  You've got to see his face.  He just ripped his limbs off.  You've got to see his face later on tonight.  It's unbelievable.  Look at Lewis.  He looks scared.  Now they're showing Lennox Lewis.  I'm sorry.  I wasn't expecting that.  My word.  That's Lewis' man.  That's his right-hand man there.  Yeah.  All right.  Well...  I am not used to such treatment when we are talking about rounds of fisticuffs. 
[02:16:00]  It's so friggin' funny, the difference between him and Tyson.  He's, like, known as the gentleman, you know.  Very gentlemanly.  You know?  There it is.  Look.  He walks right up to him and starts swinging.  Isn't that great?  Like, Tyson didn't even stop.  Melee.  He just walked up to him and started punching.  Tyson might be a marketing genius.  He should market this radio station here in New York.  A lot of interest in that.  He gets people talking.  Now everyone's talking.  I mean, it's all over CNN.  It's all over Fox.  Okay.  We have a meeting of the station here today. 
[02:16:30]  Anyone whose ratings don't go up by the next book, I will F you till you love me.  That's some incentive.  I am.  Oh, good, good.  I am.  I am.  You said good, so I figure I'll keep on that roll.  Well, if you say so.  All right.  Anthony, we have a fine, fine sister outside the studio that wants in on the Naughty Nighty 
[02:17:00]  contest.  Yeah.  Ladies, you have an hour left for, left in today to get in on the contest.  Yeah.  And we'll continue tomorrow and the rest of the week, blah, blah, blah.  But we'll talk to this fine African princess in a minute or two, okay?  Oh.  But first, Anthony, they have made it to Staten Island.  Oh, thank God you picked up.  Why?  What's up, man?  Because we're standing outside of Patty's abode.  And we just got cruised by some dark gentleman in a car. 
[02:17:30]  What?  He just kind of cruised by and took a look at us and then kept going.  Oh.  So, and there's more coming towards us.  We're going to make our way to the door.  This is not a great neighborhood you sent us to.  Thanks, guys.  What?  Patty doesn't live in a nice neighborhood?  Um, uh, no.  Are you getting a lot of it on video?  Oh, yeah.  Good.  Oh, yeah.  We're up at the...  I live in a crack house.  Yeah.  Well, um, we're up at the front door now.  So I'm going to ring the bell. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, that's good.  Yeah, they've got to answer the door.  Yeah, they're filming...  He's got to answer the door.  Make sure we hear it.  They're filming, yeah, the Cribs.  Cribs.  And they'll be on foundrymusic.com, the actual video clip.  Yeah.  But we're just checking in with Rick to see how it's going.  I don't think the bells work and I've got to nod.  The bells, bro.  Is it the one you've got to touch the two wires together?  Yeah, I like...  Here she is.  Wow, come on in.  Come on in.  Just like the Mariah Carey crack. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah, sure.  What's she dressed in, Rick?  Yeah.  Well, Patty's dressed in a black ensemble, a black sweater that's obviously too big, black  jeans, I think, and a little flip on Chinese slippers.  Hey, Rick, first question, like, describe the house from the outside.  Is it a house?  Is it a walk-up?  From the outside, it's a big Victorian-looking old house.  Okay.  A lot of the houses in this area have this look.  All right.  Usually, a Victorian's very nice. 
[02:19:00]  Is it nice on the outside?  Excuse me?  Is it nice on the outside?  Patty was trying to talk to me at the same time.  I want to know.  I've seen Victorians that are beautiful.  And then there's ones that are really run down.  Right.  How is this?  No, this is in fair condition.  All right.  Can you turn the radio down in there?  Because we're going to feed back.  All right.  Yeah, it's in fair condition from the outside.  All right.  Rick, your first thought as you walk into Patty's crib.  My first thought as we walked into Patty's crib. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  It's hard to put into words.  Why?  Well, you have to.  Does she, like, is it her place or is she just renting a room?  No, it's definitely not her place.  There's a lot of women in here.  There's one, two, three, about four different women in here.  Are they foundlings?  Is Patty the leader of the foundlings?  They're a motorcycle gang.  You've got to get beat in.  Wait, so there's a lot of weird-looking ladies just looking at you?  There's a lot of ladies in here. 
[02:20:00]  Well, what are the ages of them?  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, this is Pat, the head of the house.  Pat, the head of the house.  There's a head of the house?  Yes.  Let's talk to Pat.  Put her on the phone.  Let's talk to Pat.  Pat, talk to Opie and Anthony.  Say hi real quick.  No, not.  Okay, she doesn't want to talk.  Oh, boy.  Ask Patty who Pat is and what does she do?  She's the head of the house, but what does she do?  It's Pat.  What do you do here, Pat?  Pat, what do you do, Pat?  She's the head of the whorehouse?  What is she? 
[02:20:30]  I know.  It's like a burl.  Her housewife?  All right.  She's a housewife.  So, she's married, but she lives there?  Right.  We have a spokesperson, I think, for the house.  Thank God.  Kim.  Spokesperson for the family.  What does Pat do?  Hello?  Turn this down.  Turn this down.  I'm going to die.  All right.  I am not getting a real good impression of what's going on there.  There are a bunch of women living there.  There are a bunch of women living here. 
[02:21:00]  If Pat lives there, too, how could she be a housewife?  Is she married and she lives there?  All right.  Here.  Here it is.  Here it is from...  What am I...  Yeah.  Answer.  Hello?  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  Patty?  No, this isn't Patty.  This is Kim.  They all sound alike.  They all sound like...  You sound like Patty.  I sound like Patty.  A little bit.  She's been here for a few weeks.  All right.  What's your name?  Kim.  Kim?  Kim.  All right.  And Kim, what's the story as far as this house goes? 
[02:21:30]  This is my mother's house and Patty rents a room from her.  Oh.  And you have other tenants in there, too?  No.  This is my mother's house.  Oh.  Well, and who are the other ladies that are there right now?  All my sisters.  Oh.  They're hiding.  I got you.  So your mother rents the house out and she lives there.  No, no.  My mother rents just a room out to Patty.  All right.  So it's just a room upstairs or something.  No.  Just a room off the kitchen.  Off the kitchen.  Off the kitchen.  She's got the Alice room, the Brady Bunch. 
[02:22:00]  The Alice room.  Yeah.  It's kind of like that.  Off the kitchen.  Off the kitchen.  All right.  And the Alice room, like the Brady Bunch.  If I could ask, what is her rent?  What is Patty's rent?  Yeah.  Patty?  What's her rent?  Does Patty mind talent?  I don't know, Patty.  I'd say a hundred a month.  A hundred a month.  A hundred a month.  Oof.  Wow.  That's 25 bucks a week.  That's not bad.  That's 25 bucks a week.  When I had my room when I was like in my very early 20s, I rented a room. 
[02:22:30]  It was $50 a week.  Does she sleep in the septic tank like an upper decker?  No.  She doesn't sleep in a septic tank.  All right.  So she rents a room.  She has a nice little cozy room.  She decorated it herself.  Ah.  All right.  Well, that's funny.  I guess you'll see that in a couple of minutes.  Yeah.  That's why we're here.  All right.  Why don't we put Rick back now?  Okay.  Hold on.  Thank you, Kim. 
[02:23:00]  There was a laugh from Rick.  All right.  So Patty rents a room.  Patty rents a room.  Off the kitchen.  Excuse me?  Off the kitchen.  Off the kitchen.  Right.  All right.  Why don't we make our way into Patty's room?  Yeah, let's look at Patty's room.  All right.  Well, hold on.  We're going to go up to Patty's accordion-style makeshift door.  Okay.  Oh, it's one of those sliding accordions.  Yes.  And there she is.  All right.  Yay! 
[02:23:30]  All right.  Here we go.  What?  She's trying to show us into her room.  Okay.  And I guess we're...  Are you inviting us in, Patty?  Yes.  Come right on in.  All right.  All right.  How is she, heinous?  Rick's in hell.  Steve's in hell.  Come right on in.  There's my beanie.  God, are you trying to...  Hold on.  Hold on.  We're getting a quick tour.  Now, they've closed us in to this closet they call a room.  And Patty, what is this up here up on your wall? 
[02:24:00]  Oh, I've got Ozzy on one side here.  Some pictures of Ozzy.  I've got some Beatles in the corner.  John and George Harrison are together.  And look at the phone up there that someone gave me as a gift.  An old 1027 FM talk phone.  And then I've got an NEW mug down here.  And this is my music collection of 400 tapes.  Tapes. 
[02:24:30]  With everything you could think of.  Tapes.  This is a picture of my father and me as a baby.  All right.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  I've got to see this.  All right.  So, there's a picture of Patty's father, who was the stockbroker that was married, that  was banging.  Patty's mom, who we found out was a stripper.  Yeah.  Now, which one are you, Patty?  There's two kids in this picture with this guy.  That's you?  Yeah.  This is me in the crib, the playpen, and whatever.  Wow.  The high chair there.  There you go.  That's disturbing. 
[02:25:00]  What else does she have in there?  What does her bed look like?  She looks fairly normal.  Karen, the cops just called.  They said to tell you that we're related.  Karen, the cops just kicked in.  Oh, they're doing okay.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Tell her to shut up.  Yes, I can.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  What's her bed look like?  Where she gets her F on.  She's still giving us a tour of her wall unit.  I bowled in the house east when I was in the 210 club.  What?  What's the?  Hold on.  Slow down.  Slow down.  What's the 210 club, Patty? 
[02:25:30]  When you can bowl like a 250 or a 225.  210.  I bowled a 244 to get one of them.  So why not the 244 club?  It's like the 210 club and over when you bowl enough games over.  And then the other one is simply a 200 club.  So she's a bowler.  Thanks, Rick.  Is there an altar to Opie there somewhere?  From college.  And there is a college picture of Opie. 
[02:26:00]  You guys are not going to believe this.  And then me from about 20 years ago.  Oh, my God.  That's 20 years ago?  That could be yesterday.  I know.  I haven't been.  Jesus.  Hey, Rick.  And then, you know, I've got my high school yearbook.  She's still talking.  She doesn't talk.  This is like the car ride over here.  She was talking to the radio for a second.  Hey, Rick.  Rick.  You have to have her say it on video.  And here's where the magic happens.  When she gets to the bed.  Okay. 
[02:26:30]  All right.  She's still pointing out some other stuff to Steve here on video.  Hey, Rick.  Is the picture of Opie where she could actually lay in bed and rub one out looking at it?  Um, it's actually on the ceiling.  You're kidding, right?  Yeah, I'm kidding.  No.  My heart just stopped.  Uh, Patty, what is that hair you have on the, uh, on the side there?  She's got a big braid of hair hanging off her shoulder.  Off her, off her wall here.  What is that?  Oh, this is a monkey. 
[02:27:00]  What?  Hair from a monkey?  It's actually a monkey.  I guess it's fake hair.  Oh.  Yeah.  I don't know what the hell they're talking about.  Yeah.  All right.  Um, let's see.  What else are we looking at here, Patty?  We'll go into another tunnel.  And for us.  This is where the magic happens.  And she's talking about her bed.  All right.  What does her bed look like, Rick?  Yeah.  Look what I think we said.  Oh, my God.  What?  That is disturbing.  What? 
[02:27:30]  She's got, she's got, hold on, I got it.  Um, she's got an old WNEW t-shirt when we used to play music.  Yeah.  With your pictures on the back.  Oh.  As children.  As children that she sleeps in.  And let me just say, it doesn't look like it's ever been washed.  Ah.  Not ever, ever, ever.  Look under the bed.  You want to look under the bed?  Yeah.  Look under the bed.  All right, Steve.  Let's take a look under the bed here. 
[02:28:00]  Let's hope.  I don't know what she's got under the bed.  Jay, Jay on line one goes, listening to Rick is like Blair Witch Project.  Something bad will happen.  Oh.  Make you stand in the Q&A.  And you know the inside of that shirt smells like tuna fish and abandonment.  Oh.  Oh, God.  All right.  Well, it's obvious her bed is a cot.  It's a cot.  It's a cot?  It's a cot.  She sleeps on a cot in a closet.  She sleeps on a cot in a closet that's no more than seven by ten. 
[02:28:30]  Her room is seven by ten.  It's a jail cell.  Five feet.  Five feet across, you think?  Five feet across.  Let me.  Five feet across, Ant.  Maybe ten feet long.  Okay.  It's about six by eleven.  Great.  Wonderful.  It does have a window.  Oh, it does?  Yeah.  What does it overlook?  What's the scene outside?  Yeah, Mariah Carey showed the lovely view from her penthouse apartment.  Yeah, it sees down the alley behind a couple of houses. 
[02:29:00]  Behind an alley.  Yeah.  That's great.  She's got a great view.  All right.  What is that?  Ask Patty if this is the first time she's had a man in her room.  Hold on.  She's talking to me at the same time.  What did you say?  Ask her if this is the first time she's had a man in her room.  Oh.  Patty, is this the first time you've ever had a man in your room who was alive?  Maybe.  Oh, a little action going on?  Yeah.  What? 
[02:29:30]  What'd you say there, Ant?  A little action, maybe, she's had?  Have you had any action in here?  No.  No.  What have you had in here, Patty?  All right, Rick.  She rubs one out like, Rick, this is what we're going to do.  What?  Rick.  She's got your naughty nighties.  So the naughty nighties.  Hold on, honey.  She's got a naughty nightie?  They're going to keep poking their heads in.  Al-Qaeda prisoners live better than her.  Yeah, no kidding.  Where are those idiot liberals?  Go to Stalker Patty's house in Staten Island.  And Adam says opening Al Capone's vault was more exciting. 
[02:30:00]  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  This is what we want you to do.  Just take it all in.  We're going to take a break.  And then we'll go back to you.  So...  Yeah, I'll tell you about the little dresser here that she has covered with Opie and Anthony  stickers.  Right.  All right.  And you're going to have to open that dresser drawer, you know.  All right.  All right.  You got it.  Maybe open it up live, kind of like Geraldo.  Yes, Al Capone's vault.  Actually, she does have three of the four dresser drawers in her big dresser that look like 
[02:30:30]  they're still attached.  So we're going to open those, too.  It's a chest of drawers.  A chest of drawers.  We'll be opening drawers.  Welcome to this edition of MTV Hovels.  All right, Rick.  Thank you.  You got it.  We'll check in with you in a few minutes.  No problem.  All right.  And what's Rick's energy level?  It's a little creepy, I think.  Let me tell you something.  Rick has done a lot of things for us out on the street.  He's covered a lot of the events we've done here, the Sex for Sam and whatnot, whatever. 
[02:31:00]  He's like on frigging Quaaludes in there.  Hey, Rick, look over here.  Do this.  Well, Patty's now doing it.  It's like, God, you get a little energy in you.  Look around.  Start opening stuff.  Start going through our private things.  That's what you got to do.  Open up those drawers.  Find those big bloomers.  I enjoyed it so far.  Yeah?  It's a bit creepy, yeah.  I don't think Rick could put a little more into it.  All right.  We'll tell him that.  Shake it up a little bit. 
[02:31:30]  And we got to talk to our latest contestant in the Naughty Nighty Contest.  We'll do that in just a bit.  Talk, talk, talk, Opie.  Talking, talking out of one's butt crack.  Anthony.  Is a sign of personal confidence.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This show will really give you brain damage.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.  Andy.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Rick should be checking in again.  To wrap up, Stalker Patty Cribs. 
[02:32:00]  Stalker Patty Cribs.  The videos will be up on foundrymusic.com.  They went to kind of film the whole thing.  We're just checking in on the whole process.  That's all this is about.  Yeah, and then we'll put the video up on the website so you can actually check out Patty's crib.  A lot of guys saying that Rick and Steve are in a really, really, really bad neighborhood.  Yeah, that's what I'm hearing.  And that they should get out before dark.  Oh, too late.  Rick, what's going on?  Yeah, much too late, guys. 
[02:32:30]  But we're in the safe confines of Patty's hollow.  Yeah.  I must say, Ann was kind of bitching, saying that you were a little lethargic today, Rick.  It was a little, like, I've heard you're more energetic.  Well, you know what?  It's something about the environment that is just kind of sucking the life out of me.  All right, maybe your life force is being sucked dry.  Right.  That's what I was picking up on.  I mean, you're met with, you go to the house and there's a bunch of other foundlings around.  A little coffee clutch going on.  And then you've got gangs driving by, just kind of checking you out, making sure you're not the police. 
[02:33:00]  I'd be a little freaked myself.  Yeah.  So you can understand Steve and I's reservations.  All right.  But during Spots, I did stumble across a bevy of fodder here for us.  All right.  I found a 1974 high school yearbook.  Yeah.  With Patty in it.  Oh, you've got to get that.  We've got to put that on the site.  We've had a...  Can we close that door?  Because they keep coming in.  Oh, man. 
[02:33:30]  Stupid little wash women.  Yeah, you just picked it.  Man, I was using Tide.  Hey, Rick, did you say a bevy of fodder?  Bevy of fodder.  Don't ever say that again.  I know you love it, Jim.  We're trying to get away from that brand of humor.  Yeah.  Well, in going through Patty's yearbook here, there's proof of her actually going to the school because I see a photo.  Okay.  And with a surprise, she hasn't changed.  She has what?  She hasn't changed.  She hasn't changed the babe, yeah.  Looks exactly right. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Does it list like her likes and dislikes?  Um, no.  Oh, no.  That's her name.  Are you getting behind the green crystal in the ship?  Maybe that's screwing up your, uh, screwing up your phone.  That green crystal she used to make the, uh, her home in the North Pole.  Hey, Rick, in the yearbook, is she voted most likely to be a victim?  No, but I got to tell you, she went to school with some hot chicks.  Oh, God.  Really? 
[02:34:30]  I'm serious, man.  We're going to videotape some of these pictures.  There's one, Ivan Aguilera.  Sweet.  Sweet, right?  Well, what else have you found in this place?  Anything?  Um.  Have you opened the drawers and stuff?  We found a 42-year-old doll that has one eye.  Oh, yeah.  Steve, did you get the 42-year-old doll here?  Yeah, I got the doll.  Patty, what's the story behind the doll?  It's a voodoo doll of my mother.  I used to play with that doll when I was three.  It was the last thing my daddy gave me.  Who gave it to you, Patty?  Who gave it to you, Patty? 
[02:35:00]  I don't remember where it came from.  I was only three when I got it.  At the foundling house.  They handed them out.  For Christmas.  Toys that no other kids wanted.  The Landon Misfit Toys.  I got it from the Toys for Tots program.  I played with her really hard.  Toys for Carradentos.  Like she has only one eye.  What happened to the other eye, Rick?  What happened to the other eye, Patty?  I don't know.  I guess I broke it when I was playing with her. 
[02:35:30]  Everyone laugh.  All she knew was to neglect it like her mother did her.  So she probably beat it against the wall and whatnot.  She was really rough with her toys.  Also found out that the bowling team she was part of was called the Squires and Femmes.  The Squires and Femmes.  What the hell is that?  Ugh.  Oh, you know what I was telling you about before?  The little nightstand with all the WOW stickers on it?  Yeah.  I'm going to venture down here and see what else is on here. 
[02:36:00]  Does this open, Patty?  Yes.  Will anything bite me?  No.  All right.  This has like...  She doesn't even know what is in here.  Yeah, it's just like a camera, an old CD player, masking tape, whatever.  Handcuffs, break the blight.  Hold on.  I'm pulling the whole drawer out to see what else she's hiding in here.  It could be some good stuff.  This is my eighth grade ring.  This is from the eighth grade, this first thing. 
[02:36:30]  And this is from this joy thing.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I was thinking the same thing.  All right.  What else, Rick?  We got to...  All right.  We're venturing over...  Shut up, Patty.  We're venturing over to the bigger dresser here.  She's got three drawers.  It's supposed to have four, but there's one missing.  All right.  All right.  One missing.  Just a big void in the middle of it.  There's a wig. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  I don't know what...  What is that?  What is that?  What are those?  Are those clothes you wear or what?  Um, yeah, it's just, uh, like something to put under something sheer that I might wear.  Oh, it's a little sexy camisole.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  Hey, Rick.  Hey, Patty.  Hold this up for Steve.  Rick.  Yeah.  How did Patty, uh, show you her lingerie?  Ah.  What would she consider lingerie?  All right.  Patty, can you show us your lingerie drawer? 
[02:37:30]  Ah.  Where you might keep the sexy underpin with your arms.  Ah, nice.  Hot.  Um, all I see is flannel.  Flannel?  Flannel.  Oh, what is that?  Holy cow.  What is it, Rick?  Football players don't have pads that big.  I don't know.  This bra that she has.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Holy Christ.  I don't need...  What is...  You wear this?  No.  What is it, Rick?  No.  Dude, it's got to be the...  Look at the... 
[02:38:00]  Steve, look at this.  I'm looking at this.  It's a strapless crime case.  I have to wear a gown sometime.  For what?  What the hell are you wearing a gown?  Hey, Cinderella wore a gown.  Oh, stop it.  For what?  She says she's saving it for when she gets married.  Oh, Jesus.  That's nice.  A padded bra and period panties.  Lovely wedding evening.  All right.  We're venturing down to other drawers here.  Hey, give Steve the phone.  I've got to get his reaction here. 
[02:38:30]  All right.  Hold on.  Steve from foundrymusic.com filming the thing for the website.  Steve, what do you think?  Can I go now?  What's your thoughts, man?  What's your thoughts?  On the whole scene.  Well, first of all, the three of us barely fit in this room.  I mean, I can reach my arms out and touch both walls.  Oh, God.  She sleeps on what looks like the kind of cot you might have taken a nap in in kindergarten.  And there's just ripped up, there's a drawer filled with ripped up newspapers that she calls her Beatles collection. 
[02:39:00]  What?  Yeah.  I mean, it's a mangled, it's a mangled cardboard drawer.  Steve's doing a better job for us.  Yeah.  It's her Beatle collection?  Yeah.  It's a mangled cardboard drawer that she, uh, box, I'm sorry, that she, um, that she calls her Beatles collection.  Good.  And, uh, oh, oh, okay.  And it also has, uh, has entire photo albums filled with newspaper clippings.  Of John Lennon.  Of John Lennon and Paul McCartney. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, my God.  I mean.  Maybe it was a conspiracy.  Yeah.  I, I, I, I, hey, man, there's two, there's two left.  We've got to protect them.  We should get some cops over there.  Yeah.  This is scary stuff.  This is, I mean, really, very precise.  Look, she's got, she's got a photo of Ringo's bungalow.  Uh-huh.  That she probably took herself.  No, I got that out of a magazine.  This is not where I want to be when I'm 45 years old.  Hi, Mark David.  Yeah.  How are you?  What are you doing today? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, me too.  I'm just cutting out some more articles about yours.  So, Mark David, you're going to, oh, you're going by the Dakota?  Yeah, I was going to go by.  No, maybe tomorrow.  I shouldn't tomorrow?  Bye, Mark David.  You know, interestingly enough, like, a lot of the furnishings in this place are souvenirs  from places Patty works.  Like, there's an everything yogurt mug on the wall.  Everything yogurt.  Everything yogurt.  There's Godiva stuffed animals. 
[02:40:30]  Godiva.  Godiva teddy bear, it looks like.  I mean, just basically remnants of her little shattered life.  Of her non-existent life.  Hold on.  The girl could drop dead tomorrow and no one would care.  Yeah.  Isn't that awful?  I mean, there's a dresser that looked like she picked up off the curb that's missing a  bottom drawer.  There's plastic fish and some kind of little vortex, you know, bubbly thing.  I don't know if she's allowed to have real fish in here. 
[02:41:00]  Hold on, Steve.  Matt from West Islip says, today he learned Patty's apartment, 66 square feet of loneliness.  Great.  Oh, no.  Patty is modeling a lovely little hat with fake braids on it for us.  Fake braids, yeah.  Yeah.  Most of her possessions can be picked up on 42nd Street for a dollar.  Wow.  I mean, it is.  Hey, is there a copy of Catchers in the Rye on her bookshelf?  Patty, you wouldn't happen to have a copy of Catcher in the Rye on your shelf, would you? 
[02:41:30]  No, I don't.  Look, David, I need my copy of Catcher in the Rye back.  Yeah.  I'm thinking maybe tomorrow I'll go to the Dakota, but I shouldn't go.  Why?  Oh, you're going today?  Well, why shouldn't I go tomorrow if you go today?  I won't see John tomorrow.  Why?  Hey, Patty.  You can't tell me?  Patty?  Yes?  Patty, could you tell us what kind of books you have in this makeshift plastic bookshelf you've ever had? 
[02:42:00]  Oh, God.  I want to know her book.  Well, I've got books by Tori Hayden.  I've got books on the Beatles.  I have Shout.  This is the original Apple to the Core from 68.  What?  Or 70, when it was first released.  She's got an old Apple Core that's been there since 1968?  Yeah.  Patty, you're an ass with worthless possessions.  Yeah, what are you, like, these are your little treasures?  They're worthless.  Yeah. 
[02:42:30]  I mean, I collect stuff like this.  I'm getting creeped out, man.  I got some tour books on Ozzy.  Oh, what years?  1984, this one.  Whoa.  And I'm talking Ozzy Nelson.  That was the Spark at the Moon tour.  I want that.  Does she have a TV or anything?  No, I watch TV in the regular room.  Oh, so you have to watch it with the, you have to watch it with that family?  With the rest of the foundlings.  No.  All right.  Hey, put Steve back on the phone.  Or me.  Yes, Steve. 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  All right, dudes, we've got to take a break, and then we'll wrap up with you guys, all right?  Okay, great, guys.  So, search a little deeper and see what else we could talk about on the air.  Yeah, there's another couple feet we have to check out.  All right, cool.  Awful.  They're worth nothing.  Thank you, Steve.  Anthony, good news.  Let's get her in real fast.  Our latest contestant on the Dirty United contest.  Her pictures have been taken, and they are up on Opie and Anthony's.  Anthony.com right now.  Her name is Candy.  K-A-N-D-E-E.  From Brooklyn.  Yeah, Brooklyn. 
[02:43:30]  A light African princess.  What's up?  Hi.  Hello.  With blonde hair.  I like it.  She's got the braids going.  Candy's sexy.  Yeah.  Man, I just looked at your pictures.  Oh, my goodness.  Picture three.  That's nice.  Look at that.  Let me go.  Is that picture three?  Booty, booty, booty, booty.  Yo.  Yeah.  Look at that butt.  That's nice.  You have the tattoo on the back, right?  Yeah.  Hey, can you move that butt?  No, could you lift that? 
[02:44:00]  No, no, because I want to see the third thing.  Yeah.  What?  This?  Now, lift that.  Show that booty.  This?  Wow.  Yeah.  Bam.  That's what I'm talking about.  Bam.  Bam.  That's not a gang tattoo, is it?  Huh?  Is that a gang tattoo?  Hell no.  All right.  No gang tattoo.  Are you a racist?  No.  I'll put you.  I've never seen a tattoo like that in your neighborhood.  I'll put that.  I'm not that kind of girl.  All right.  Can you make that butt move?  No, unfortunately not.  I'm not that kind of girl either. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah.  Is she a boyfriend?  Yeah, I do.  She's very cute, Anthony.  Beautiful.  Her pictures are up on opianthony.com, our ladies contestant in the Naughty Nighty contest.  Your boyfriend ain't Mike Tyson, is it?  No.  Oh, thank God.  Oh, no.  No way.  Because he'd be pissed off.  Definitely not.  I come down there.  I'm going to F you all till you love me.  Jesus.  Look at Opie, though.  Is that a gang tattoo?  Hey, can you move a little for us?  I know.  Oh, hot, man.  Little soft shoe?  Hey.  Oh, I'm the problem today.  That's a nice nighty.  Where'd you steal it?  What the hell's the matter with you, Opie?  Oh, I'm the problem. 
[02:45:00]  Sorry for him.  He's Mr. Stereotype, is what you're going to get from Opie.  Oh, I'm the problem today.  I'm not that type of black girl.  Sorry.  Right.  That's too bad.  That's nice.  You're very lovely, right?  Yeah.  We like you.  Uh-huh.  Hey, how old are you, Candy?  26.  You're 26?  How old do I look?  You look a lot younger than you.  You look like you're in your early 20s.  Anthony?  I bet you get proofed a lot, right?  Hell yeah.  Yeah, huh?  I do believe we're looking at a finalist in the Naughty Nighty concert.  Yeah.  For that trip to Heathenism 3, Anthony. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, baby.  Candy.  Check out our pictures on opianthony.com.  Very nice.  Those cheeks in that picture are so solid.  Look at that, huh?  Look at that.  Yeah, kid.  What can I say?  That's great.  Geez, Norton.  What do you mean by that?  That is really nice.  I like the...  Solid.  I like the shadow.  The shadow.  All right, Jimmy the Greek.  I'll just hang back.  Jimmy the Greek.  No, no, it's an expression.  The cheeks are solid.  That's any girl's ass that's nice.  And those...  Solid.  You see the little white thong disappearing.  Oh, how lovely.  All right, listen.  We're running late, so we're going to come back. 
[02:46:00]  We're going to wrap up with Rick and Steve at Stark of Patty's Place.  Maybe play a little bit of What Did We Learn on the Opian Anthony Show.  All right.  The Naughty Nighty contest continues tomorrow right here in New York.  So, ladies, if you're in the area, you just stop by like Candy did with her Naughty Nighty,  and we'll take your pictures, and you'll be in on the contest.  Right.  Thank you.  You've got to see Teen Melanie and Candy.  They're our latest contestants, Anthony.  Who is the Robert Englund weirdo?  Who is this guy?  That's my brother, douchebag.  Ah, Robert Englund.  Dude, he will take you out in life. 
[02:46:30]  You think Tyson's scary?  You should see him fight.  I'm not saying he's not cute, but he was just like Robert Englund.  F you until you love him.  He's got a real job.  He's got to wear, like, you know, those type of clothes and stuff, dude.  Douche.  Wow.  Now, Naughty's cursing.  He goes, oh, yes.  Oh, you're cursing.  And he's got the psycho factor, too. 
[02:47:00]  He'll take you right out.  Serve up that other foot with a little salt and ketchup.  It'll taste better that way.  Anthony.  Yeah.  The other cities can get involved with this Naughty Nighty contest.  A bunch of them have.  Yeah.  And for your listeners in the other cities, go to opianthony.com,  especially if you want in on this contest, and they'll explain how you can do it yourself.  Okay?  Right.  All right.  Hi, we're here.  We're here under your skin.  Us two A-holes.  Hello.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:47:30]  And E-W.  Hey, Ed.  Yo.  Finally back.  Where'd you go?  To get my stuff.  Get your junk?  You know, it's game night, man.  You got to get out of here for the Islander-Ranger game, eh?  Eh.  I couldn't find a brewer bit, so we have to talk our way to the end.  Yeah.  I wanted to throw on brewers so bad.  Islander-Rangers tonight.  Come on.  Yes.  All right.  Where are we?  So Candy's pictures are up on opianthony.com for the Naughty Nighty contest. 
[02:48:00]  Go check those out.  We got Candy today, and we also got Teen Melanie.  Those were our two contestants for today.  The turnout, quite frankly, disappointing so far, but not as far as quality goes.  The quality, very nice, but we need more ladies to come out of the woodwork.  Usually they do, so we have enough confidence that this contest will turn out all right.  That's the problem.  Usually with our contest, the girls look like they did just crawl out of some woodwork.  See, we're getting better girls now, which is nice. 
[02:48:30]  And we want the other cities to get involved.  Well, I know for a fact, which cities, Ben?  Boston, Washington, Philly, Cleveland, and Buffalo are all in.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you go to opianthony.com.  What we have set up with those cities, while we're on the air from 3 to 7,  you just go down to the radio station where we're broadcasting on.  Yeah.  Does that make sense?  Sure it does.  I'm a little tired today.  Sorry.  And I got someone with a digital camera, so you show up with your Naughty Nighty in Cleveland, 
[02:49:00]  Buffalo, Washington, Philly.  All the addresses are up on opianthony.com for all those stations.  Then they'll get us the pictures.  We put them up on the website, and you're voted on exactly like you were if you were here.  It's our first shot at a national contest, so we're working out the bugs.  But that'll work for now, right?  Let's go to Rick as he wraps up Stalker Patty Cribs.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Rick.  Hey, man.  Yeah, well, Steve and I are here with Patty.  Steve and I are now expecting a child quarters here are so cramped. 
[02:49:30]  But we've moved on to the other part of her room.  Wait, what was that?  What was that?  You were expecting a what, Rick?  Steve and I one...  Ah, forget it.  What?  Move on.  What?  Shut up.  Why do you say that?  Did he get a bevy of fodder on your back?  Yes.  Come on.  I had to listen to the replay of the white shorts joke over the weekend.  You heard that?  I didn't even hear what the joke was, though.  What was it?  What was it?  Don't worry about it.  Steve and I are expecting a child. 
[02:50:00]  The quarters are so cramped.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, that was it.  Meaning that, what, you're so close that apparently you had some sex?  Yes.  And somehow you're so close that men and men could have a child?  Yes.  In a small of a...  So you're expecting a fondling.  A foundling.  A foundling.  It's white shorts.  It's my white shorts.  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay.  Horrific.  Oh, God.  Again, Rick.  I am vindicated.  We're moving over to her Beanie Baby collection. 
[02:50:30]  Beanie Baby.  This is the fondling.  Talk about these Beanie Babies, Patty.  Well, the ones in the packages are teeny Beanie Babies, and they're worth more, so they're  still in their packages.  Oh, you delusional stupid.  What are you, insane?  You delusional stupid.  Welcome to fourth grade.  You delusional stupid.  Is she also a fathead, Anthony?  You dumb jerk-o.  Patty. 
[02:51:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  You want to talk to her here?  Get Patty the phone.  I have to set her straight.  Hold on.  I've got to interrupt, Anthony.  Oh, yes.  Something much more exciting is going on on the lines right now.  Fonz.  Fonz.  Yeah.  Hey.  What's up?  You run the board in Cleveland for us?  Yeah.  I got our first contestant here in Cleveland.  Her name is Shannon.  Shannon, say hi to the guys.  Hello, boys.  Shannon.  From Cleveland.  Nice.  Look at Cleveland.  Look at you goddamn people in Cleveland.  Cleveland knows how to participate with this radio show.  It's awesome.  All right. 
[02:51:30]  So you went down the station in Cleveland with your naughty nightie?  I did.  And Fonz is standing by with the digital camera.  He'll take the pictures and send them off to us, right?  Oh, God, guys.  This girl is so hot.  All right.  What do you look like there?  What do you look like there?  What do I look like?  I've got a little nursey outfit on.  I look like a little naughty nurse.  Oh, naughty nurse.  From Cleveland.  I like naughty nurses.  Hey, she's hot?  She is hot, dude.  She's got red hair. 
[02:52:00]  Shannon, how old are you?  I'm 25.  All right.  Now, Fonz.  Yeah.  You know, have you seen the Rick technique of taking pictures?  Yes, we've seen the Rick technique.  I've been studying the pictures that are up on the site now, man.  So we're going to do a good job for you.  Well, follow his direction because how ridiculously unfunny he was in that last joke.  He is that good at taking pictures.  That's photography.  We will definitely follow you guys' direction.  All right.  And if any other ladies, especially in the Cleveland area, because they seem motivated, 
[02:52:30]  Anthony.  Yeah.  If they want in on the Naughty Nighty contest, you just see Fonz tomorrow while we're broadcasting  live from 3 to 7.  Just head down to the Cleveland radio station, all right?  Thank you, Fonz.  No problem, guys.  And thank you to that naughty nurse there.  Bye.  We look forward to seeing your pictures later tonight or tomorrow on the website, all right?  Okay.  Thank you.  Tell you a little one to feel flop and he can just take it so painfully good.  I heard it when it came out.  Yeah.  Dead silence. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  The flop sweat forming on the brow.  Oh, I hope there's a bad connection.  Rick, what's up?  No, I'm not saying anything anymore.  Rick, put her on the phone because I got to set her straight.  Yeah, we got to wrap up the Stalker Patty Cribs and get the hell out of here.  Yeah, we're standing under her Beanie Baby collection.  Here she is.  Patty.  Hello?  Patty, you are collecting Beanie Babies and you keep some in bags saying they're worth more?  Yeah, well, I keep them in their original packaging.  Beanie Babies worth nothing, never will be worth anything. 
[02:53:30]  They're those things that have been, like, flooded the market like that.  McGuire rookie carts.  You know when that guy was selling Beanie Babies?  It pretty much made him worthless.  Put yourself in a plastic bag.  Could you do that?  Patty, you crawl into a plastic garbage bag.  What?  Try to breathe.  Oh, talk to me!  All right, listen.  What?  Oh, my God.  What are you, the Stone Cold Steve Austin?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What?  What? 
[02:54:00]  What?  You're the ugliest stripper I've ever seen in my life.  What?  What?  What?  What?  Hey, Patty, are you and Rick expecting a child?  No.  Not at all.  But would you like to really see my World Tour 84 Aussie book?  Yes.  Well, sure, I'll bring it in for you to look at.  Sure.  All right, Patty, we got to go.  So thanks for doing Stalker Patty Cribs with us today, okay?  All right.  They're going to take one of the Beanie Babies out of the pocket.  The videos will be up on FoundryMusic.com.  A few people go, where the hell are the Naughty Nighty pictures? 
[02:54:30]  I'm on FoundryMusic.com.  Steve is at Stalker Patty's Cribs, so he doesn't have time to link to OpieAndAnthony.com, where  you will find the Naughty Nighty contestants.  Does that make sense to everyone out there?  Yes.  Okay.  Go to OpieAndAnthony.com.  Sure.  Until Steve gets home, and then he'll have them up on his site.  Right?  Kerosene in a match.  All right.  Hey, guys, do you want me to open this thing?  What thing?  The Beanie Baby.  Have an open Beanie.  No.  No.  Don't break her heart any more than it already is. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Just Mr. Snatch everything she's ever given you.  I've turned over New Leaf, my friends.  All right.  We've got one more.  I don't want to be so predictable.  One more section for you.  Yeah, go ahead.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  Patty.  Quickly.  Take us over here, and what is this real quick?  This is my vanity that I make myself beautiful with.  My bath oils and my...  You've got bath oils.  Yeah.  Whatever I use in the bath.  It should be a pile of masks. 
[02:55:30]  The light switch off.  Not all that's beauty-ing her up in that place.  All right.  As they wrap up, we've got to get the hell out of here.  Thank you.  The video clips will be up.  I can't wait to see the video.  Yeah.  Now I've got to watch the video.  Come on.  All right.  We'll do it again tomorrow for Whipping Mount Wednesday.  Hope your pregnancy goes well, Rick.  Just a little ribbon.  You all know that men can't have children. 
[02:56:00]  I think.  You can't say that word.  What's wrong with you?  All right.  We've got to get.  All right.  Thank you, Rick.  Thank you, Steve.  Thanks, guys.  See you later.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow.  We'll see you guys tomorrow. </pre>
