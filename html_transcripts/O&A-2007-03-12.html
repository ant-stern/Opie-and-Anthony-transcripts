<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie, Anthony, and Bob Kelly (filling in for Jim Norton) discussing their tardiness, blaming overly strict post-9/11 building security.  They jocularly contrasted this with the more lax security depicted in action movies. The conversation transitioned to Opie's alcohol-free St. Patrick's Day parade experience and the unusual quietness of morning traffic due to daylight saving time.  The hosts then discussed the recent suicide of comedian Richard Jeni, with Kelly recounting a prior unsettling encounter with him. Graphic details of Jeni's suicide, including speculation on the method and cleanup, were shared.  Numerous listener calls followed, detailing their own experiences with suicide and its aftermath, often including graphic descriptions.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to "No Filter Paul," a listener known for disrupting live news reports.  Audio and footage of Paul confronting a reporter at a Barack Obama event, and his subsequent apprehension, were played. The hosts discussed Paul's tactics, and reminisced about past "assaults on the media" contests. The show then moved to a dissection of the online questionnaires from Buffalo's "Wake Up with Janet and Nick," mocking the hosts' personalities and answers.  A prank call to an NBA TV show featuring the recurring character "Steve from Yellowstone" was played. The show concluded the first chunk with discussion of a video showing a man assaulting two elderly women, focusing on the attacker's description and the hosts' frustration with perceived political correctness.  They engaged in darkly humorous, and at times offensively racist, speculation about the assault and the attacker's motivations.  Several callers weighed in, including one who claimed to be searching for the suspect, another expressing outrage, and Kurt, who challenged the hosts’ racist commentary, sparking a debate about racial profiling.  The show continued mocking "Wake Up with Janet and Nick," playing clips and making sexually suggestive comments about Sam, the on-air assistant.

The next segment started with a caller discussing the booing of a Buffalo Sabres game MC who also hosted a morning show.  The hosts again discussed the deaths of Richard Jeni and Brad Delp (who had played at one of their Christmas parties), playing audio clips of past, often contentious, interactions with Jeni, acknowledging a past feud and subsequent reconciliation.  They speculated on Jeni’s suicide, citing internet criticism and possible medical issues.  The conversation shifted to a Washington state high school attempting to ban booing at sporting events, sparking a debate about the "pussification of America."  The hosts announced an upcoming comedy tour with Joe Rogan and Bob Kelly and briefly mentioned a MacBook karaoke contest. A random anecdote about a Houston couple wanting to name their baby "Grady" was also shared.

A caller then recounted a bizarre underwater fight with a Frenchman during a scuba diving lesson.  This transitioned into an interview with Jared Cotter from *American Idol*, who discussed his experience, interactions with other contestants (including Antonella), and receiving encouragement from Babyface.  The hosts, along with Bob Kelly, speculated about the judges' biases and the influence of different voting blocs.  The conversation returned to Richard Jeni's death, with Jimmy Norton offering his perspective.  Norton's comedy tour dates and experiences were discussed, followed by various tangents. The segment concluded with a call from "Half a Hulk Face," detailing his upcoming facial tumor surgery.

The following segment focused on "Half a Hulk Face" and his upcoming surgery, with jokes about the procedure and potential for a TV show. A pregnant caller from Houston discussed the name Grady and post-Katrina crime; a caller from Cleveland asked about a voiceover gig for Half a Hulk Face; a listener who drove eight hours to the show was revealed to be an Army parachute rigger; and several other listeners in the studio were briefly interviewed.  A significant portion involved an awkward interview with a prospective intern, Jared, who was partially disrobed on air and subjected to sexually explicit jokes and humiliating tasks.  Jared revealed previous humiliating experiences with another radio host.  The segment included interactions with Master Poe, a martial arts expert in the studio, and ended with a discussion of a deceased listener.

The final segment began with the hosts discussing a "line of the day" sponsored by Bodogfight.com, before transitioning to increasingly erratic behavior from a guest, Bob.  Bob tased himself while touching the microphone, causing a TV malfunction.  The segment concluded chaotically, with arguments about whether the show was still on the air, Bob repeatedly leaving and returning, profuse profanity from both Bob ("Fuck you, Opie," "Go suck my dick") and the hosts ("Bobby's a homo"), and speculation about the lingering smell of onions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!  No!  Oh my God!  No!  Opie.  I'm scum because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just whores.  James Norton.  Look at this face, how do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Vagel here on the radio with you.  Sex Vagel.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  And Sex Vagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh my God, is this early.  No one's here.  Everyone pulled the old gag.  Yeah.  I have my alarm. 
[00:01:00]  I set my alarm.  I forgot to set my clock ahead.  Nah, I was waiting to see who would be the first one.  Actually, I thought it would be E-Rock, but...  It's Bob Kelly, actually.  There he is, Bob Kelly.  Oh, Bobby.  Walking in.  What's up, Bobby?  Nothing says motivation like being two minutes late, walking in with your winter coat on.  That's the spirit.  That's what we need on the Opie and Anthony show.  Nothing but commitment from Bob Kelly. 
[00:01:30]  The guy wouldn't let you off.  I've been here for ten minutes.  He wouldn't let me up.  Really?  No, I said...  The guy was like, dude, I've never seen you here because I've been working here 25 years.  Yeah, well...  I was like, well, I've never seen you.  And I just go up.  He's like, no.  He guessed on the show upstairs.  That guy's whole job, you're talking about the security guy downstairs, his whole job  is to be a pain in the ass.  Well, he doesn't...  Ever since 9-11, we talk about this, every building has to have, like, the doorman, the  guy you have to sign in with.  There has to be a whole security thing. 
[00:02:00]  That guy ain't stopping crap downstairs.  They used to just be the guy that would tip his hat and say, hello, sir, and you'd walk  upstairs.  That was his job.  Hello, sir.  Can I grab that bag for you, ma'am?  Can I do this?  Whatever.  He's a porter!  Yeah.  Now they've turned into these pseudo-security guards where you walk in and unless you have  some ID and you're signing in and all kinds of paperwork, you're some kind of criminal. 
[00:02:30]  It used to, used to, used to be when you'd pull up, they'd go, would you like some lemonade,  sir?  Yeah, I got some lemonade for you.  It happens to us.  Keith the cop.  His badge, whatever, the security card we all have wasn't working.  It's not working.  I'm sitting there like, you've seen this guy like a million times.  I know.  He's obviously not the terrorist.  Let him upstairs, you're paying the ass.  It's a certain profile.  It's an hour early for everybody.  It's a certain look the terrorists have.  I can understand when I get pulled aside. 
[00:03:00]  He can stop me, too.  Yeah, you're going by that.  Me and Anthony shouldn't even be up here.  That's why I remember my card every day.  But after 9-11, like you said, these guys were nobodies.  Yeah.  They decided every building needs security, so they take these nobodies and make them  into something.  They're the first line of defense.  It's like, dude, you were like a porter, and now you're the first defense against the  cowhands.  So they're calling them the first line of defense.  Are you kidding me? 
[00:03:30]  That's funny.  Stop.  You know what those guys are?  They're the first guys that get shot in every action movie where they take over a building.  They go, can I help you?  Boom.  They're just dead.  Either that or the guy that has to hold the lady's little dog while it's barking.  Yeah.  Everything's blowing up around him.  Even as far back as Die Hard.  It was like he was the first guy.  They came in talking basketball, and then bam, shot him right in the head.  And they don't even use the big guns.  It's just usually a pistol. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, a pistol.  Just bam.  Like you're swatting a fly.  Just drag him off somewhere, dress in his suit, and sit down at the desk.  Two hours later on the 40th floor.  Mowing down people with machine guns.  Mowing down people, you break out all the equipment, your freaking grenades and everything else.  Everything.  But this guy, it's one bullet to the front of the head with a pistol.  You watch Blade Trinity also.  They walk in, and the security guard goes to grab the phone to get the cops.  And the one guy goes, I wouldn't do that. 
[00:04:30]  Just points the gun at him, and he's, oh, okay.  He snaps his neck.  He's not worth a bullet.  He has to snap his neck.  He uses jiu-jitsu on him.  They're awful.  Yeah, well, good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I got to say hi to all the alcoholics that met in Huntington yesterday.  Oh.  The hometown.  Wow, you're saying hi to a lot of people.  The hometown had their St. Paddy's Day parade, and I checked it out yesterday.  Yeah.  A bunch of just alcoholics.  No one can understand why I wasn't drinking. 
[00:05:00]  Like, I was, hey, why aren't you, you know, come on, party time.  Right.  They're like, you can drink till 8 or 9 and go to bed, and then you'll have some good stories.  And I'm just thinking to myself, and I'll also be really hungover and not feel like talking.  Plus, it's like 3 or whatever time it is today.  Yeah, you got to get up.  And I don't care what the clock says.  It's still, when I wake up, just like a quarter after 3 in the morning.  It's pretty much it.  No, it's really 6. 
[00:05:30]  So, is it?  No, look outside.  This is, like, this is, like, this is usually 4.15.  4, yeah.  It's ridiculous.  On Friday, we actually looked out this massive window we have here in New York at all these lovely buildings.  We actually started seeing the hint of daylight.  Sun coming up and going, ah, cool, you know, summertime coming up, spring, and it's nice, and you can see some light.  That feeling we got on Friday, we have to wait now another month.  About a month.  No, actually, maybe two months. 
[00:06:00]  Before we start seeing some light in the morning.  So, there you go.  Normal people with normal jobs, they'll get to see some light in the morning, and then they get to see a lot of light at night.  That's what the whole thing is about for those people, not for people that wake up really early.  I didn't set the clocks ahead in my truck.  So, as I'm driving, I kind of glance down at my clock, and I just go, like, oh, my God, there's still a 3 in the number.  Yeah.  There's still a 3.  It's 3-something.  It's just not normal. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  But there you go.  See, even lately, when we get in here, every phone is ringing?  Yep.  There's no phone ringing.  No.  They're still sleeping.  There wasn't much traffic at all coming in either.  I noticed, like, wow, a lot of people kind of screwed up.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we'll give out the phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  It's the O&A Virus, the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out.  Bob Kelly in for Jim Norton.  How are you, Bob?  I'm good.  I feel fresh and excited to be here. 
[00:07:00]  Freaking excited.  Did you hear about Richard Jenney?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Being a comic, what do you think?  I would have put my odds on Colin Quinn before Richard Jenney.  Oh, my God.  Great.  I think that's still out there if you want to take odds on that.  That's brutal, man.  If you haven't heard yet, Richard Jenney, a comedian that some people knew.  I just met him officially for the first time three weeks ago in LA.  Oh, okay.  Now it explains it.  Now I know.  Why didn't he shoot himself three weeks ago? 
[00:07:30]  Did he seem a little sad?  Yeah.  I mean, I don't want to sound like, I don't want to be that, you know, that person on CNN.  You know, I met him once and he seems sad.  You know something?  In hindsight, I really saw a problem.  I love how Bob Kelly just said that.  If your phone rang, you'd run out of here to do your TV spot to talk about Richard Jenney.  But I'd wear an O&A shirt.  There you go.  Hey, thanks.  He seemed a little sad.  Well, dude, he just seemed, I mean, like, you know, you meet those guys from those giant,  he was a giant from the 80s.  I mean, those guys were huge. 
[00:08:00]  And you meet them and sometimes they're cocky.  Sometimes they still think that it's the 80s.  But he was.  Yeah, huh?  Yeah.  Wow.  There's another odds on.  Listen, I, uh, he, uh, he was, he just came up.  He was like, Hey man, I'm, I'm like, I'm Richard.  Like I wouldn't know who he was real humble and really quiet.  And he seemed, he seemed, I was telling Dane that night.  I was like, man, he seems kind of like down and kind of, no kidding.  Really?  Yeah, dude.  I was talking to Dane.  It was just, just really, he was killing on stage. 
[00:08:30]  But you know, a comic when he's killing, there's that energy after the joke, almost as confidence  where you're looking at the crowd.  Like I got you.  He would kill, and I was watching him and he kind of like, you know, all right, my God,  I've been doing this.  Business as usual.  That worked.  Okay.  I mean, that was just my, my, my, uh, observation that night.  I mean, but he was, I mean, he was really nice, dude.  So Dr. Kelly, what else did you see in him?  Well, what happened was he had a liver spot on his eyelid.  And I figured, no, I don't know.  There were some things in the paper that said there's some undisclosed illness that he was 
[00:09:00]  talking about.  Well, just to finish the story for the people that, that didn't hear, obviously he killed  himself in the shower with a handgun.  Uh, apparently they didn't say what kind of gun, but he went and told his girlfriend,  said, I'm taking a shower.  He goes in, she hears a kaplow, uh, goes in, uh, sees, uh, makes the 911 call and says,  uh, my boyfriend just shot himself in the face.  Uh, the cops and, uh, EMTs come and, uh, he was still, uh, still kicking. 
[00:09:30]  So they take him to the hospital.  He didn't get the job done right.  He, so yeah, he died at the hospital.  Yeah, man.  He tried to get the boxes and move the hell out of there.  Yeah.  How the hell are you going to take a shower after that?  But you were going to add, I'm sorry about, Oh, it, it kind of is kind of courteous to  do it that way because it makes for an easier cleanup.  I think, I think it's like you do it in your bedroom or, uh, somewhere else.  And they got to bring that cleaning crew in.  That's got to cut out big sections of your carpet and, you know, repaint the walls. 
[00:10:00]  But if you take the black light in there, you still see it through the walls and stuff.  But the shower to me, you just hose it down.  He's just talking about the Pulp Fishing cleanup.  Are you calling him a people pleaser?  Well, I'm just saying, maybe he thought it out.  Normally he was suicidal.  He, he didn't want people not to like him because he put blood on the wall.  Yeah.  Cause you know, that's kind of hard to clean up.  If you have the shower, uh, the, the shower curtain closed just right, there's no brain  matter or anything else flying out of the, you know, the bath area. 
[00:10:30]  What are you, are you using this estimation from something you do in the shower, Opie?  That you shoot all over the wall?  Yeah.  Pretty much like killing yourself.  So he's easily hosed down, you know, the showers.  But there's rumors.  There's a drain in the bottom.  They had some kind of medical condition.  Did you see anything?  Was he like looking a little peaked?  He just looked, I mean, look.  How was his color?  How was his color?  He looked fine, dude.  I mean, he had, he's, first of all, he had the greatest hairpiece in the business.  I mean, he had the, uh, the, you know, the transplants. 
[00:11:00]  He had great hair.  He still looked great.  He was in shape and he was still killing.  He was on stage.  He's annihilated.  Maybe you shouldn't say he's, he was still killing.  Yeah, he was still killing.  Maybe it's a different comedian term you could use for that.  Yeah, maybe, uh, he was doing good jokes or something.  He was doing very good jokes.  Really?  He was doing very good jokes.  He was killing.  I was like, oh.  Yeah, I don't know.  I guess, uh, he just, uh, it was like going through the motions or something, you know?  You got the crowd. 
[00:11:30]  You got everything a comic would want up on stage.  And then, eh, you just kind of, eh.  Well, he was number one.  He was number one.  We had our, uh, differences with Mr. Jenny.  No surprise there.  We have differences with everybody alive, it seems.  But we can't, you know something?  It really was a goof.  It was like, uh, like we talk about it and it ends up on the news.  Every time we talk about a subject that's up on the TV, on the TV, they're showing a clip.  That means we're just up on things, man.  Yeah, man.  They're showing, uh, Mr. Jenny. 
[00:12:00]  Uh, we, we had our, we had our problems with,  uh, Richard Jenny over the years.  But it was kind of a goof when he came in.  He came into the show when we were over at, uh, N.E.W.  And, uh, we were doing something and guy, he kind of, he was out in the green room.  And he was getting a little perturbed, I think, that we had him waiting so long.  And he started saying stuff.  So we turned it around and made it like, well,  maybe you're not funny enough to come on right now.  And maybe we ought to do like a pre-interview thing through the door. 
[00:12:30]  Jesus.  So we kind of had him on the other side of the door and we were in the studio talking to him through this little,  we looked at him through this little window, like a prison visit.  We called it a prison visit.  Prison visit.  Back in the day.  And, uh, made him, like, prove that he was funny enough to come in.  Did he?  No.  Oh, no.  Yeah, we were really mean to him.  Oh, geez.  And then, uh, and then he sent in a CD.  It was like filled with like 9-11, like towelhead type jokes.  Right. 
[00:13:00]  And he wanted to push that and it was god awful.  So then we started searching his CD for the funny parts.  Oh, we were just brutal to Mr. Jenny.  Yeah.  And then he finally came in and we kind of hit it off.  Yeah.  I mean, he was definitely a nice guy, but we really, really busted his mold.  Didn't we have him back on after that?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  We talked about that.  He had him in and he was cool with it.  Yeah.  I guess.  You guys, man, I guess.  I like to think so I can sleep at night. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, dude.  Oh, man.  Well, you made him talk through a box.  Just another.  Talk through a window.  Like a little window, too.  It was like a little, like.  Yeah.  Like a solitary window.  Yeah, yeah.  Like a little, you know, a thin window.  It wasn't even wide.  It was like.  Look at Paul McCartney's breasts.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  He's a billionaire, man.  Take care of those man boots.  Some lipo or something.  Oh, my God.  Don't wear shirts like that.  He looks like an 85-year-old woman going without a bra. 
[00:14:00]  Oof.  Hey, really fast.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, Chris.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Chris.  Hey, what's going down?  Hey, nothing.  Now, Anthony, you were talking about, you know, how he did it in the bathroom and they got  the cleanup crew to bring it in there?  We had a drunk guy.  He was walking in my neighborhood.  He offed himself on my lawn.  Ooh.  And I had the ambulance come and the cleanup crew the next day.  They left all the plastic, the needles, all that nonsense all over my lawn.  They didn't clean up.  Me and my father the next day were hosing it down.  You had a hose-down dead guy off your lawn? 
[00:14:30]  Hose down all the blood and all the, they left all the plastic hypodermic needles.  It was disgusting.  They should have, like, a cleanup crew, man.  Yeah, it costs money.  We're sitting there the next day going, what the hell are we doing?  It was like, neighbors are waving at us.  We're, you know, it was ridiculous.  Did you just, like, shovel out the bad part and put new dirt and sod in?  That's what I would have done.  We had to do the whole thing.  It was ridiculous.  Just rototill it under?  Just a big piece of brand new sod in the middle of your lawn? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, everyone knows what it's all about, why it's there.  Cut out in the shape of a body.  What happened here?  Oh, nothing.  His sister comes and puts a wooden cross.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Now it becomes a memorial.  Yeah, we talk about those.  We hate those.  I don't like the memorials they put in buildings, too.  Like, we had this horrible fire in the Bronx, and people come over and bring candles.  Why don't you bring a bunch of candles to a fire site, anyway, where a bunch of kids died from a fire?  That's the last thing they want to see.  The last thing you want is more fire. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, that's the last thing they want to see is a flame.  That's great.  Candles and poems.  And it's like little stuffed animals and mylar balloons, and it's so morbid and just unnecessary.  Like, mourn and everything, that's fine.  Or if you want to be one of those curiosity seekers who want to stand there and look and then cry so the news can interview you, that's another thing.  But enough with the makeshift memorials.  I'll keep it for the cemetery where it belongs.  All right.  I don't have to look at it.  All right. 
[00:16:00]  I'll punch it out.  I'll see you later.  All right.  Thanks, Chris.  Thanks for the dead guy story.  We appreciate it.  Nothing worse than doing 80 or 85, 90 down Southern State Parkway and seeing one of those crosses on a tree with a big gouge taken out of it.  It kind of reminds you, you know, and you kind of take off the – you let off the gas a little bit.  Then you're pissed off because now you have to let off the gas.  Annoying.  Let's say hi to Jimmy the trucker.  Jimmy, what's up?  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good, Jimmy.  Right on.  Hey, I got an opposite end of that cleanup story for you. 
[00:16:30]  My dad actually shot himself in his car.  Cool.  No cleanup whatsoever.  They told the car he sent it to the crusher.  They take it to Big Joe's?  Yeah.  All right, boys.  Later on.  All right.  Why are we getting suicide stories?  God, we had prison stories last week, now suicide stories.  We got Jeff in New Hampshire.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on this morning?  Hey, man.  What's up?  Back in 74, I was an 8-year-old kid. 
[00:17:00]  My old man decided to punch out with a 12-gauge shotgun in the bedroom of my grandfather's house.  And I was –  Telling.  I came to the house the day after, and they didn't quite have the cleanup done, and it looked like a Jackson Pollock painting.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  I don't mean to laugh because it's your dad, but that's messed up, man.  Yeah, I left a little bit of an impression. 
[00:17:30]  It really sucked.  An impression?  Yeah.  Was it impressionistic?  Not an episode I care to repeat.  I'm taking a different path, boys.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Well, when he does it at his dad's house like that, oof.  Yeah.  That's saying something.  Absolutely.  Hey.  All right.  Thanks for the upbringing.  Shoot yourself in the face, though.  I mean, you've got to use a big caliber.  You can't use, like, a little ricochets around in your head. 
[00:18:00]  You're still alive, looking at your bottom lip, hanging out.  A little pellet gun.  Yeah, dude.  You can hear it, like, clanging around in your head.  Oh, God.  All right.  Listen.  We're going to, like, regroup here.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got lots to do today.  Tomorrow's the day we announce the first O&A traveling virus comedy show.  Already.  Can you believe it?  Tomorrow we announce the first date, and it's coming soon, by the way.  Yep.  We're doing one in April, and then hopefully about 9 to 10 to follow in other cities.  But the first one will be announced tomorrow. 
[00:18:30]  Man.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  That's pretty cool.  Also, this Thursday, we're doing a wee for a wee.  Yep.  Doing a wee for a wee, man.  Might have heard about that in the news a couple of months ago.  But we're going to do it.  We're going to show all of radio.  It can be done without killing a listener.  It can be done.  Oh, no.  What, Bob?  Can you announce the virus tour?  The odds are.  Can you do the virus tour now?  Can you just...  Can we get all 10-day bin next week? 
[00:19:00]  Look, if we get fired...  Oh, no.  We're doing the wee for a wee.  Someone died, Opie.  We'll get National Press, and then we'll sell more tickets to the comedy show.  That's just how things work.  Dude.  You know how many times that contest was done?  We did it back at N.E.W.  Odds are.  Do you know how many times it was done when somebody died?  Yeah, once.  Exactly.  Once.  That was the last time.  So we've got to take the stigma off of it.  That's right.  We've got to bring that back.  Yeah, bring it back.  See, the thing is, if people just let these things happen and then don't do anything about them, 
[00:19:30]  they become verboten.  Not allowed anymore.  Can't do it.  See, we're trying to kind of turn the corner here where something happens, then you do it.  Again, and it's to show people, look, everything's fine.  And then you're able to do it again.  Yeah.  So there's somebody somewhere doing it in a church.  Well, maybe that.  You don't do it again.  All right.  So, well, we're doing that Thursday, a wee for a wee.  Yes. 
[00:20:00]  Absolutely.  And we've got more suicide stories.  Do you want to go down the path?  Oh, God.  This is supposed to be a happy show.  Yeah, it's a fun, happy show.  We want to keep it happy.  We might have to just blow off these calls today.  I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  Right.  We'll figure it out after the break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.

It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  We say good morning to Buffalo.  It's all about Buffalo this week.  It's about Buffalo, it's about Chicago, and it's about New York City. 
[00:21:00]  Love you.  It seems like those cities love us just a little bit more.  Yeah.  Feeling the love.  And to be honest, I think Philly loves us, but we're not sure because the ratings are  all effed up down there because they're using a new rating system and no one knows how to  read them yet.  They're getting like code breakers and stuff from all over the country to try to figure  out what's going on in the ratings of Philly.  Wind talkers.  It's all in Navajo, I think.  Something.  The ratings now.  Yeah.  Never got a report on the ratings of Philly because the people I called, they're like,  ah, we got to break the code. 
[00:21:30]  Ah, I don't know.  It's a new type and one of the companies don't subscribe to it, so we have nothing to compare  it to and base it on.  And oh, okay.  Thanks.  By the way, no one's safe in Buffalo Radio.  One of the shows broadcasting right now alongside us.  Yep.  We'll get a beating this week.  We're still trying to decide which show to go after this week in Buffalo.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  We had a little action over the weekend. 
[00:22:00]  A little action.  The One Pest were at it.  Oh, yeah.  No Filter Paul did another assault on the media.  He's like the superstar of the assaults on the media.  He really is.  Sounds like he got assaulted because at the end of the clip you hear, don't touch me.  Don't touch me.  He actually plans these things out.  He knows where the news is going to be.  He knows where the stories are, so he knows where the live shots are going to be. 
[00:22:30]  And he waits, sits there waiting.  And right when that live shot comes in, there he is.  Oprah and Anthony.  And officially, we don't condone these things right now.  Well, we're not officially sponsoring, backing, or promoting them.  Right.  But, you know, we can't stop a fan from doing what they're going to do.  But they never went away.  Yeah.  And No Filter Paul does it perfectly.  He knows not to touch the reporter and all that, blah, blah, blah.  But they touch him.  They roughed him up pretty good. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  They roughed him up.  We used to get in trouble for these because we kind of gave prizes for the best one.  We'd wait, like, the end of the month and pick the best one and give a prize.  So it was kind of like we were a little too involved.  Now it's just, you know, listeners will do what they do to support the show.  And if they want to get behind a reporter during a live shot when he's out in public like that,  there's nothing we can do to stop him.  I'm not going to say stop doing it.  And Paul's obsessed with Channel 7, I guess.  Yeah.  The ABC affiliate here in New York.  He hits them all the time. 
[00:23:30]  And in this shot, you see the videos up on openanthony.com.  You see a guy running into the frame and grabbing Paul and taking him away.  My favorite part is looking at the reporter's starter's report and seeing Paul in the background with that black bag.  And he's just kind of standing there looking around.  And the guy starts his report.  And then they slowly start walking toward.  And it turns into a run.  And they pull their signs out and just start yelling behind him.  Oh, it's like Jack Ruby fucking up to Oswald.  He's in the background trying to not look suspicious, but he looks completely suspicious. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, totally.  Because he's trying not to be suspicious.  I guess it was out in front of a hotel where the cabs come and pick up people from the hotel.  So it wouldn't have been odd for people to be standing there holding bags.  Yeah, that's really smart to do an assault on the media when Obama's in town.  Yeah.  It's an Obama story.  And also you're acting like a lunatic.  That's real smart.  And they completely threw the news team back at the studio also because they went right to the film clip. 
[00:24:30]  And I guess they were still trying to put the graphics up.  So the graphic gets put up and it's wrong.  And then it just says, place text here on the screen.  And then there was a black stripe at the top of the screen.  Like they completely threw the people back in the studio.  Well, the video is really good.  But here's the audio for the radio people.  No filter, Paul, everyone.  The rising star of the Democratic Party, Barack Obama, raising a lot of money in New York tonight. 
[00:25:00]  Political reporter Dave Evans was there.  He's in Midtown for us.  Bill?  Well, Bill, I think this is what you call chutzpah.  Obama coming to Clinton's own backyard, the Grand Hyatt here in Midtown.  I'm raising lots and lots of money.  Obama, don't touch me!  As he left tonight, Barack Obama only said, I love New York.  Obama, don't touch me!  Don't touch me!  Yeah, a couple of goons came out and grabbed him.  A couple of the news goons.  They didn't know it was a baby with a mustache. 
[00:25:30]  They had no idea what it was.  A moustachioed baby comes out with a sign.  That stupid small head of his.  He has like a head that just never developed in the front.  He really is a giant infant with a mustache.  It's like Beetlejuice who pissed somebody off in the afterlife, just sprinkled shrinking powder on his head.  He could take care of that small head of his if he just lost weight.  He's the type of guy that should lose weight just to make his head look like it's in proportion to the rest of his body.  He should be a skinny guy, yeah. 
[00:26:00]  He looks like one of those stress dolls.  If you squeeze him really hard, his head will get bigger and go to normal size.  And then you squeeze his head and the body gets fat.  He is just, but he's the best when it comes to these.  Yeah, he's.  He really has no fear.  No.  I watch these things though.  I like, I download them and watch them as they go.  Let's go to our reporter.  That's when I start going like, oh no.  Oh, I start cringing and watching kind of.  I'm the same way.  Kind of through one eye going, oh, here it comes.  I'm like, I can't watch this. 
[00:26:30]  There he is running into the screen.  Yeah, running in.  And there comes the gooners causing a ruckus and the reporter turned around to look at him.  Like sometimes the reporter can plow right through it.  Hold the mic up high and he doesn't even pay attention to him behind him.  No, this guy.  This guy kind of turned around and they cut right to the film piece.  But you still heard, don't touch me.  This is the reporter.  You hear footsteps in New York coming up behind you.  You know, you freak out.  Yeah.  Hey, I think today's the day.  No filter, Paul. 
[00:27:00]  You're not impressing anyone anymore.  What?  He's done a million of these.  Same MO, same thing.  Blah, blah, blah.  I think he needs to do one in his diaper.  Diapers?  Yeah, I think he needs to do one in a diaper.  How would he do that, though?  How would you just take his pants off?  It's already on.  Maybe get some of those NBA pants.  Oh, the tearaways?  The tearaways.  Yeah, that might work.  Oh, wow.  That would be hysterical.  Because I've got to tell you, I was home this weekend. 
[00:27:30]  I'm like, oh, another assault on the media by No Filter, Paul.  And I actually made this ho-hum, ho-hum.  Did you?  Ho-hum.  I like that they're using the smaller signs that fit into the frame better.  Yeah, that's true.  They took our advice on that one.  I think he needs to do something just a little special.  Maybe a diaper.  I say he has to do a diaper.  In a diety.  We don't even acknowledge any more assaults on the media by No Filter, Paul, until he does  one in a diaper.  Oh.  He'll do it.  Well, he did walk from this studio to the other studio in a diaper. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  And then he did something that was just one of the most horrific things I've ever seen  a grown man do in my life.  Well, he was taking some medicine at the time, and it kind of loosened him up a bit.  No, he didn't.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, I remember.  Yeah.  And he just stood in the studio on a bunch of newspapers.  Like a little poodle.  And just proceeded.  Let's just put it this way.  The after effects looked worse than Richard Jenne's shower.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Jesus.  Oh, that's awful.  It wasn't good.  Oh, God.  It wasn't good whatsoever.  Hey, let's say hi to Buffalo.  It's Al in Buffalo.  Al, what do you have for the Opie and Anthony show?  Hey, Al.  Al.  Hey, you guys said you're going to go after a radio station in Buffalo?  Yeah, it's Buffalo's turn this week.  What do you think?  Kiss 98.5.  What's the morning show?  Oh, they're just annoying.  They're like that cheery, happy. 
[00:29:00]  That's who we're looking for.  They're like Eric and Kathy.  They're like, what's the other show we made fun of?  Rebecca and Glenn?  Yeah, yeah.  Something like that.  Wow, you're good.  I think.  I remember Rebecca.  That drove her car into a strip club?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  God, I love Rebecca.  Sam, are we going after Kiss in Buffalo?  Yeah.  Janet and Nick is the show.  Janet and Nick?  No, Janet and Nick.  Janet and Nick.  Janet.  What the hell are you from? 
[00:29:30]  All right, Al, I think we're going to go after Kiss this week.  Awesome, thank you.  All right, thank you, sir.  Janet and Nick, what are they about?  They're like Eric and Kathy, except they're a nice, friendly show.  Yeah.  Janet has top billing.  Yeah, that's a little odd.  Usually the guy comes first in the name, and then the whole, she's kind of attached to  the end of the name.  You know?  That must really, this guy must be completely emasculated.  Because it's bad enough when you're, you know, Glenn and Kathy or whatever the hell, 
[00:30:00]  when your name is first, you're still emasculated because you've got to hear, oh, now, be nice.  Well, those people work very hard.  Yes, I know.  I was just joking.  We'll be back after blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, it's always this emasculating thing, but with her name first, ooh, I could only  imagine.  This guy probably can't open his yap more than, like, five words an hour.  Go back to what you just had there, Iraq.  I want to read that.  Wake up with Janet and Nick. 
[00:30:30]  Ah, it's wake up.  Wake up with Janet and Nick.  Wake up with whoopies.  See, that works, but wake up with Janet and Nick.  Wake up with whoopies.  One of their big features online is photos of her new English bulldog.  All right.  Does it also involve some peanut butter?  Because then it should be up on their front page.  Hey, by the way, Bert from Philly, Opie's humanity meter is laser accurate.  I guess Paul was getting too high a reading. 
[00:31:00]  Hey, wait a minute.  Janet's kind of a looker.  Stop.  You're in radio.  How long have you been in this business?  How long have you been in the business?  You explain to me what I'm going to tell you about the website pictures.  She's hot.  She's hot.  Thank you.  That's like my headshot.  I'm thin in my headshot.  Opie, remember a certain photo of a certain girl behind a tree? 
[00:31:30]  That's all I got to say.  And the risky business sunglasses.  Shut up.  Right.  You're going to ruin it.  It's always a way.  We may or may not have worked at a radio station where we all had to take publicity shots.  And there was a beastly one that they needed to take a picture.  But with a hot voice.  I mean, the voice got guys so worked up into a lather.  A sexy voice.  But then they'd go to the website to see a picture of her. 
[00:32:00]  And I don't know if the station.  The station must have done this.  Said, look.  Okay.  We're going to take a picture.  They put it completely behind a tree where she's just poking her head out like one eyeball.  Half her face.  And even that is covered with, like, Ray-Bans.  So, like, you could only see sunglasses poking around a giant tree.  And everyone else is being photographed in the sunlight.  In the studio, maybe with a couple of rock stars or something. 
[00:32:30]  Not a hint of a tree anywhere that's nearby.  She's got a ninja photo.  Yeah, a ninja photo.  It's like, what guy told her?  And at what point during the photo session do you go, all right, get behind the tree.  All right.  No, not next to it.  No, no.  Completely behind the tree.  Now, poke your head out.  No, too much.  Back, back.  Now, put on these sunglasses.  That's the look.  Yeah.  Put a bandana on your hair. 
[00:33:00]  So, you're saying, Janet, isn't this hot?  I'd have to see different pictures.  Yeah, I'm thinking they got the best picture possible.  Well, from a while ago.  She's got a friend's haircut, so this could be a while back.  Well, Buffalo, you know, loving the show, so we've got to give them a little attention this week.  So, we're going to see what this Janet and Nick's going to go about.  Oh, well, okay.  I don't care about anything else.  I just read the first little answer to her question, and I'm hooked already on the show.  Well, every website, you have to have a questionnaire that your jocks fill out. 
[00:33:30]  What is that?  Just every frigging website.  Just to show their personality.  That way you get to know them a little better.  If you were a superhero, who would you be?  They asked Janet Snyder.  From the Janet and what?  Nick.  Wake up with Janet and Nick show.  Wake up with Janet and Nick.  Janet and Nick.  Superhero, who would you be?  She goes, I would be Wonder Shopper.  I can shop a mall in the speed of sound. 
[00:34:00]  In the speed of sound.  Would that be at the speed of sound?  I could shop a mall in the speed of sound.  In the speed of sound.  It would be at the speed.  In the speed.  How do you, how can you be in?  I don't know.  It's ridiculous.  First of all, how could you do that?  It would take long to ring you up.  You'd be breaking the sound barrier, which would upset the other shoppers.  It just doesn't work logistically.  And I think the shock wave and the friction from the air would probably burn your body apart.  But I can't be sure. 
[00:34:30]  Wonder Shopper is stupid.  If you're the president, what do you change first?  According to Janet, well, all Americans would only be allowed to work a four-day work week.  Hoo-hoo.  That's good.  Let the Japanese and Chinese beat us even more.  Yeah, I told you.  That's good.  No one's listening to me.  I said the Chinese are coming.  They're coming.  They're on their way.  They're still allowed to boo at sporting events.  We'll get into that story a little later. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, will we?  Okay.  I don't have that big a problem with her.  Why?  What fear do you have that most people don't know about?  Germs.  Pass the Purell, please.  Please.  All right.  Well, we could get into this a little later because it's just so over-the-top boring.  Oh, the Bill Gates-Oprah one? 
[00:35:30]  Oh, yeah.  Go ahead.  I kind of like that one.  Bill Gates or Oprah wants to marry you.  What do you do?  What do you do?  Oprah loves Chicago and her taste in the finer things.  Have you seen her place in Hawaii?  I would have to tell Bill to stop monkeying with his computer all the time.  Yeah, that's it.  Stop monkeying with that computer that got you billions upon billions of dollars.  And have you seen his place in Washington?  It's unbelievable. 
[00:36:00]  It's half the lake.  Yeah, it makes Oprah's place look like a cottage, you dummy.  What are you laughing at?  Oh, Nick's answers.  Oh, Nick's answers?  Travis couldn't help himself.  He ran in here.  Yes there, Travis.  What did you find?  I just have to read his superhero answer.  All right.  Nick from the Janet and Nick Show.  Wake up with Janet and Nick.  If you were a superhero, who would you be?  Of course, they ask him the same questions.  The world's first reggae superhero, Jamaicamon. 
[00:36:30]  By the way, he's just some, like, white guy.  Yeah, well.  He's not Jamaican or black or anything.  And every question has to have a funny little answer.  So it's, if you were president, what would you change first?  My pants!  The world is coming to an end this April 1st. 
[00:37:00]  What's the first thing you would do to beat the clock?  Trick!  The world is coming to an end on April Fool's?  Come on.  Do I look that stupid?  But seriously.  He writes, but seriously.  If you have to save it seriously, you're in trouble.  Right.  You've got to write it.  You can at least review what you said and wipe that sentence and the but seriously out. 
[00:37:30]  But seriously.  If it's for real, call Jack Bauer.  Boop beep, boop beep, boop beep.  He actually wrote the sounds that 24 has on the show.  Boop beep.  Oh.  Call Jack Bauer.  Well, this sounds like a terrific show.  Are you going to get some audio?  Yeah, I've been listening.  It is really good.  You're laughing.  How bad is it, really?  It's just a great show.  I just love all these shows.  They're so different.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  They really are.  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  Before we take another break here, another O&A pest was added over the weekend, and it  got through to NBA TV fantasy basketball show.  What network is this on?  NBA TV.  Oh, NBA TV.  Oh, that's just perfect.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  So, this guy got through a call-in talk show, and he decided to do his Steve the Bear impression.  Yeah.  You want to explain that to the newer listeners, Anthony? 
[00:38:30]  Well, Steve, our own Steve.  Steven Carr, as he's known during his rock band days, but he's Steve Carlissi.  He's a big bear.  When they went to the porno awards, him and Jimmy, all the porn people were asked, what  type of, like, porno guy is Steve?  And everyone said, oh, he's like the big bear type, you know, the big fuzzy, big bear  bottom. 
[00:39:00]  And he makes bear noises.  He goes, grr.  We got a sound of that, a little grr sound.  Where's Steve?  Grr.  That's what he did when someone called him a bear at the porno awards.  And he can say no in the speed of sound.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Try doing that.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 
[00:39:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Grr, grr.  And his acting is horrible, because in a sketch when told that somebody's parents had died, this  was Steve's reaction.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  You had to say that that's twice because he was so broken up about it.  That's terrible, I'm sorry.  And Steve has a lot of catchphrases that we all latch on to and just pound him with nonstop. 
[00:40:00]  And he's a big bear, and people have picked up on it.  And he did that little scene.  Yeah.  Because this guy uses a bunch of those in this, I think.  Yeah, we have those over the other show.  All right, so, and then, oh, God, this is kind of hard to explain.  And then there's the Steve from Yellowstone.  Yeah, that's when Jimmy calls in to a bad guest.  When we have a bad guest on the phone, Jimmy will go to another room and call up as Steve from Yellowstone.  And no matter what the guy's talking about, Steve will ask some kind of stupid question. 
[00:40:30]  The guy will start answering it.  And then in the middle of it, Steve from Yellowstone, Jimmy will just yell, Ramon, shut this ass up.  And then just start piling on, like, really bad curse words and, you know, drop the C-bomb and stuff like that.  And really pound the guy bad.  It's got to be one of the funniest things ever.  Yeah, and everyone knows it's coming when we just go, okay.  And on line five, we have Steve from Yellowstone.  Steve, you're on with blah, blah, blah.  And everyone just goes, oh, no, here it comes.  Yeah, so this guy called himself Steve from Yellowstone, calls NBA TV Fantasy Basketball Show. 
[00:41:00]  This is Tim P, and he just does all Steve references, and then he tries to end his call with Ramon.  This guy's not really picking up that he's being goofed on.  No.  On that move.  Steve is in Wyoming and joins us next.  Hey, Steve.  Hey, this is Steve from Yellowstone.  What's good, man?  What do you have?  Hey, I got a trade offered for me.  They want to give me Rashard Lewis and Allen Iverson for David West and LeBron James. 
[00:41:30]  And when I think of LeBron James, I say, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But at the same time, his free throw percentage is terrible.  I'm sorry.  Shooting 69, 68% for the charity stripe.  You are giving up LeBron James and David West?  Yes, and I just think LeBron, I do.  Gurr.  I don't know, Steve, if Gurr would be my reaction.  It may be a gasp of air.  When I look at that free throw percentage, which I know might be hurting you.  To be honest with you, if you're set with the rebounding totals, 
[00:42:00]  because David West is a double-double every single night waiting to happen right there.  Yeah, I don't know about that one either there, Steve,  but LeBron James is the best player that you would argue in this season.  He ramoned him.  I was waiting for the Ramon.  Ramon.  I had to cut him off, though.  He was going to say something really ridiculous after that.  So good job from Tim P.  Yeah.  Getting through that show with Steve from Yellowstone.  All right. 
[00:42:30]  All right.  Yeah, we got the rich.  We got it.  It is too early.  I just got to acknowledge.  Is that it?  It's just too early.  Still too early.  This change in the clock crap just sucks.  We wouldn't be on the air for another, like, ten minutes.  Yeah.  It is like a fog.  It's very foggy.  It's like a filter in here right now.  Dude, we were just, after close to a year of getting up at this certain time,  we were just getting used to it.  Yeah.  And then they throw this little monkey wrench at us. 
[00:43:00]  A little curveball.  All right.  This is what you're going to do.  You're going to now wake up an hour earlier.  Yeah.  But you get to sleep an hour.  No, I didn't.  No, this takes about a week or two to adjust.  Yeah.  We got lots to do, actually.  We got the old woman story that's just unbelievable.  Oh, yeah.  I've seen the clip on the news plenty of times because there's nothing.  The only thing worse, I think, than punching an old lady in the face is playing it 30 times on the news.  They just know what people want to see. 
[00:43:30]  People want to see big black men punching old white women in the face.  If they didn't, the news wouldn't play it 30 times.  It's an amazing story.  She was 101 years young.  Still is.  She's alive.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's a tough girl.  They call her feisty.  All right.  Listen, we're starting to talk about it.  They call her victim.  We'll talk about it after the break.  Also, very uncomfortable audio with Richard Jenny.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  He ended up killing himself over the weekend.  And E-Rock went through the archives and found some very uncomfortable audio. 
[00:44:00]  We'll play that for everybody today as well.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Virus.  Hi, this is Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony Program.  I'm coming to the Ontario Improv.  Ontario, California, not Canada.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  March 15, 16, 17, 909-484-5411.  That's the Ontario Improv. 
[00:44:30]  The California, not Canada.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  909-484-5411.  March 15 through 17.  And, um...  Together forever and never too fast.  Together forever we do.  And don't you know I would move heaven and earth to be together forever with you.  Hey, good morning. 
[00:45:00]  Thanks for checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA Virus spreading across America.  Bob Kelly sitting in for Jim Norton today.  You, uh, promoting anything, Bob?  Uh, yeah.  Via the, uh, Addison Improv this, uh, Friday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  Or Sunday.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, or something.  You guys suck at your plugs.  I know.  We really do.  You know, we don't pay you guys.  Norton is the best at plugs.  He has the phone number.  Oh, yeah.  He knows everything.  Everything.  The website.  These guys come in to, uh, you know, fill in for Jimmy or whatever, and we just like 
[00:45:30]  having more people around.  Right.  We don't pay these guys.  No.  What they get is some nice plugs for their gigs, so hopefully they get more people there  and get a little more famous or get a door deal and make a few bucks because of our show.  Right.  So your only job is to make sure you got the plug right.  That's it.  You can't even do that.  Can I tell you, though, last night, just before I went to bed, I said, I'm gonna, I'm gonna,  just wake up now, get the number, and just put it in your phone so you'll have it, because  you'll ask.  And then, uh, I was like, I'll get it tomorrow. 
[00:46:00]  I swear to God.  And you forgot.  And I forgot.  And here we are again.  You're gonna be doing Pugs and Kelly down there in Dallas?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Have you ever done their show?  I've done it twice.  Um, I've done it twice.  Yeah.  The first time I went in, they were cool.  The second time I went in, they were like, uh, I was like, hey, it was exciting to be  back.  I'm really, because I liked them the first time.  They're like, yeah, we don't know you.  Really?  I was like, oh, all right, then.  Nice talking to you.  Ah, they were like, we don't remember you.  I was like, all right.  They were probably having a bad day.  Yeah, whatever.  Is it getting harder to do, like, radio in general?  Because you're, you're traveling all over the country doing comedy. 
[00:46:30]  No.  Some of the, some of the guys, they, they said, I just can't do radio anymore.  Oh, because, yeah, well, it's, it's, you know what?  But they ask for, like, you know, what do you want us to talk about?  Pugs and Kelly don't do that.  They just, you know, you kind of just jump into whatever they're talking about.  It's kind of like this.  But, uh, most radios, it's just, yeah, what do you want to lead into?  Yeah.  I just got married.  I got some, uh, yeah, I'll write these down.  Some questions I want to give you.  The worst is when the club owner starts prepping you on how to do radio.  No way. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, every, listen, when you get in there, just get into your jokes.  Don't talk.  I know Opie and Anthony, they talk.  They, they, but that's not what these guys do.  Just do your jokes.  Just do your jokes and get in and get out.  That'll get people to want to come to the club and see you.  Exactly.  Really?  Yeah.  The club is actually Addison Improv and it's 972-404-8501.  If you guys want to come see me.  There you go.  Thursday through Sunday.  I read enough.  Wow.  You get 15 seconds because the rest of the country doesn't care.  Yeah, you're right.  People in Buffalo are like, dude, stop. 
[00:47:30]  They're like, please come here.  Yeah, probably.  Speaking of comedy, uh, we announced the first date of the ONA traveling virus tomorrow on  this fine radio show.  Yep.  And nine or 10 more shows to be announced after that.  All right.  Uh, I, this has to be a national story, but just in case we'll play the, we'll play the  news story just to get everyone up to speed.  But, uh, just an animal, uh, punching a 101 year old lady.  101 years old.  She's, uh, she's, has a walker. 
[00:48:00]  She got one of those stupid walkers with the tennis balls and the wheels on it and the  hand breaks.  She's coming out of what looks like an elevator or her apartment or something.  I think she's in the vestibule of this just old building in Queens and animals just, you  know, waiting there.  Looks around.  He gives that sleazy look around to make sure no one's watching and then just gives her  two right jabs to the side of her head, like kind of holds her head with his left hand  and kind of pops her twice with his, uh, with his, uh, no, he holds her with the right 
[00:48:30]  hand, pops her twice with the left hand, grabs her pocketbook and like right in front of her  just starts rifling through it.  So she reaches over to try to like grab the pocketbook back, not thinking anything, you  know, probably like, Oh, these whippersnappers today.  And the guy just pounds her with a right hand and knocks her right, right out.  Down goes old bitch.  Down goes grandma.  Stop the fight.  Stop the fight. 
[00:49:00]  Nah, honestly, it's just an awful story.  Here, here it is.  If in case you missed it, I'm 101 years old.  How are you going to run after a mugger?  Rose Morat's face is battered and bruised after a violent struggle with the mugger in  the lobby of her Queens apartment building.  The assault was caught on videotape in disturbing detail.  You can see Rose on her way to church with the help of a walker.  The young man she thought was opening the door turns on her, punching her repeatedly before 
[00:49:30]  taking her purse and rummaging through her pockets.  Bleeding profusely, the century old woman musters the strength to try to get her purse back.  And that's when this thief knocks her and her walker to the ground.  I got a little, a little angry, you know, and I said, Oh, that's so-and-so.  I hope you get caught.  That's so-and-so.  Yeah.  I know it.  I know what you said when you said so-and-so.  Yeah.  That's so-and-so.  I hope you get caught by a white police officer. 
[00:50:00]  Right.  Right.  I said that's so-and-so.  It sounded a little like mugger.  Bill from Waterford, the saddest thing about the black guy punching the old lady, it took  him three punches to lay her out.  What a whimp.  Yeah.  Because the joke of the community.  Yo, man, what's up with that?  Three punches for that old white woman?  What's the matter with you?  Well, I was needing the crack money.  Bastard.  Here he is.  They're showing it on the news.  Oh, there's the right. 
[00:50:30]  Down goes grandma.  That's the knockout punch.  Down goes grandma.  Oh, he Tysoned her there.  Man, she's, uh, she's all right for 101.  She's spunky.  Yeah, there she is.  Oh, yeah, look at him holding the door.  Yeah, I'll help you out.  He's got his head down.  Don't look at me.  Because that's his, he doesn't want his face on the surveillance.  Grabs her neck, two punches to the head, grabs her purse, and then the knockout punch.  Down goes grandma.  What a sparkling wiggle.  And her walker fell over on top of her. 
[00:51:00]  What a sparkling wiggle.  Look at that walker she's got.  Jesus.  No, that's the other one.  Yeah, there's two of them.  Yeah, here's the second half of the story.  Just when he thought it couldn't get worse.  As Rose's neighbors rushed to her aid, police say her attacker jumped on his pink bike and  peddled over to the Common Life Tower on 170th Street and found his second victim, 85-year-old  Solange Elisi, who suffers from Parkinson's and also uses a walker. 
[00:51:30]  He figured, all right, I could take out the 101-year-old.  I'm going to go a little younger.  Yeah.  I think I got it in me to take out an 85-year-old.  My next challenge, 85.  A shaky 85-year-old.  Yeah.  That's like, you know, you do okay, and then you decide to take on Tyson.  This guy is just a scumbag.  ...from Parkinson's and also uses a walker.  The same suspect rode the elevator up.  Well, there was a little more of a challenge with the 85-year-old because the guy suffered 
[00:52:00]  from Parkinson's or the limb.  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know, he's bobbing or she is bobbing and moving.  Moving target.  Tougher target for this savage.  She's like Rocky in Rocky III.  He had a little more speed because Apollo helped him.  The same suspect rode the elevator up with her, got off one floor below, and ran up the  Solange's door before she could get inside.  He began to beat me, beat me in my face a lot, and a lot of blood stopped coming out of my 
[00:52:30]  mouth.  Solange's chin and arm were injured in the attack, but perhaps most upsetting, the suspect  stole this widow's wedding ring that she has worn for 60 years.  The suspect is being described as a male in his 30s.  How about you friggin' put the race in there?  For the love of Christ.  They won't do it.  They haven't done it.  It just eliminates so many people.  A male in his 30s.  So now it's everybody.  Now it's everybody.  If you say a black male in his 30s, at least you know who to look for. 
[00:53:00]  Are we allowed to stay black?  God, they're so politically friggin' correct.  Say what it is.  Why the hell do they do that?  They used to always, always tell what race the person was.  Because they'd be doing it every day.  The suspect is a white male in his 40s.  Just tell what it is.  That way we know not to look at white people, not to look at Hispanic people for this, Asians. 
[00:53:30]  You know, you're looking for a black guy.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  You know what's happening, too?  Queens.  I was telling Anthony in the office.  Queens is like an area in the New York City area where everyone pretty much started from.  Like I have, my family goes back to Queens.  And, you know, it was a well-to-do neighborhood.  You know, back in the day, this 101-year-old lady, she's probably, you know, out on the sidewalk  and licking, you know, the big ice cube for five cents a lick.  My grandma tells me the stories. 
[00:54:00]  The ice man would come, you know, come around and you would get to lick the big ice cube.  That was before AIDS.  Was it the ice cube?  Yeah, no kidding.  For five cents a lick.  Really?  And he'd take the big tongs and throw it over his shoulder and walk up ten flights of stairs  to put it in a Jackie Gleason refrigerator.  Right, you know.  My great-grandfather did that.  Who didn't?  My, really?  What, did he have a horse-drawn, like, wagon?  Yeah, he was a big guy.  That's what they remember.  Yeah, but back in the day, it was all very innocent in Queens, you know? 
[00:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  It was like a Norman Rockwell painting.  Yeah.  You know, white.  Hey, Sally.  You want to go get a soda pop?  That's right.  Oh, Jack.  Can we?  Can we?  Yeah, we can.  I made extra money on my route this week, Sally.  Are you going to take me to the dance tonight?  Sure, Sally.  Oh, gosh.  I'll go home and do my hair.  I got to call Kathy and tell her.  This is what she remembers.  Yeah, of course. 
[00:55:00]  It was the good old day.  The war breaking out.  Very, in general, very innocent times.  Let's go down and we'll contribute some aluminum so our boys can win the war.  All right, Sally.  I'm going to give away my red dragon.  But I'm going to give away my nylons.  But see, here's the deal.  Like, a lot of people had the means to get out of these neighborhoods and find a better life in general.  Yeah.  And you fast forward 30 or 40 years.  Yeah, it's a whole different thing.  Oh. 
[00:55:30]  Could you help me with the door?  I need some help.  Thank you.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Down goes grandma.  Down goes grandma.  Freeze war.  It is not a sin to get rid of a dirty stain. 
[00:56:00]  That's a negro.  Wasting your time without black.  Ow.  These poor old people, they didn't have the means to get out.  And they wake up like three or four decades later.  They're living among savages.  They went from licking ice to putting ice on their faces.  Yeah.  Not like the old days.  I feel bad for these people.  She's probably been in that apartment 50 or 60 years.  Just watching the neighborhood change around her. 
[00:56:30]  And she has like, you know, nowhere to go.  Been in that same apartment.  She remembers hanging out the window and nothing but Italians and Irish down below.  She doesn't have to worry about her teeth coming out, though.  He punched her right in the jaw and nothing came out.  And down goes granny.  Down goes granny.  Goes from the good old days.  Oh, what a shame.  Yeah.  Time is a bitch.  It really, really.  You really got to relocate, lady.  Now she's like an injured gazelle. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, yeah.  She's just like that one gazelle at the watering hole.  At the watering hole.  All the other gazelles are long gone because they see the ripples in the water.  One that can't get away when the lion finally jumps out of the biz.  Yeah.  Oh, dumb old broad move.  Yeah.  But why would she open the – I mean, you look out that door you came out of and you see –  She might have came out of an elevator or something because I don't know if that was her –  I think it was the vestibule.  I think it was the vestibule of the building.  She actually asked the guy. 
[00:57:30]  You could see her.  She – he holds the door for her and she kind of motions with her head like, could you get that door too?  And maybe that annoyed him.  Like, what am I, a doorman?  Yo, bitch, what am I, a doorman?  There is no audio on that.  She could have said, hey, you, colored.  Yeah.  Get that door for me.  Excuse me, you colored.  Open the door.  Yeah.  Open the door.  Oh, I could have had you shot for that.  But the NYPD is on a mission.  They're trying to find this guy.  They can't find him yet.  Oh, they'll find him.  No. 
[00:58:00]  Did you see the picture?  You got to think like just the everyday criminal is just looking at this guy like, what a scum.  I don't know.  What a scum.  I don't know.  That's the world we live in.  That's the world we live in, especially in those areas.  It's just this animal instinct of just, you know, just prey on the weak.  And there it is.  An old 101-year-old lady.  And you punch her in the side of the head and knock her out. 
[00:58:30]  You punch her and she doesn't go down.  You punch her again and she doesn't go down.  Yeah.  And then you have to punch her again and go, ugh.  Who would think?  Well, at that point, she pissed you off.  You're like, you're not going down with two jabs in the head?  No, because he knew he was on tape because that's why I was looking down.  He's like, my friends are going to see this, man.  You can't walk away knowing that she didn't take my two points.  I'm looking all stupid.  We did have a puffy coat on.  It's kind of hard to throw jabs with that big Sean John coat on with the big hood with fur. 
[00:59:00]  If I saw a Sean John puffy coat in my vestibule, I'm not leaving the apartment.  No.  No, I'm going to turn right back around with my walker and go back upstairs until it's clear.  Until the coast is clear.  But that's the deal, man.  All of a sudden, you're like, what happened to the neighborhood?  A black guy with a pink bicycle and you walk out of your front door?  Yeah.  No.  You know he didn't buy that down at Schwinn?  He didn't go down and go, yeah, this, well, how much?  How much for the pink bicycle?  She's probably been leaving her apartment building for two decades scared out of her mind and it finally happens. 
[00:59:30]  Going to church.  She was on her way to church.  Really?  Yeah.  Has all the features, right?  Yeah.  There's two old ladies and one gay guy.  Got punched in the face the other day.  With my bike.  Why would you take my bike?  I deliver pita bread with that.  What are you doing?  We got more info coming in.  Moe from Brooklyn.  The best thing about this story was the straight face the anchor kept when she said how people are calling the police helpline with things they want to do to this guy. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  People want him strung up like Saddam only with barbed wire, one person said.  Said the police ought to tune him up when they find him.  They will.  Work him over a little bit.  Nah, too much intention will be on him.  Oh, there he is.  The cops can't have fun like that anymore.  Like in the old days, oof, this guy had been brought in with, you know, two black eyes, a broken jaw.  Oh, he resisted. 
[01:00:30]  Now you can't even do that.  You got to worry about going to jail if you're a cop.  The old days.  By the way, this is going to piss off a lot of people.  You were saying in the office, we had Patrice in recently.  We were talking about white crime, black crime.  That is such a black crime.  Yeah, it really is.  You know, because Patrice had mentioned like some kind of child abduction and then murder, rape thing.  He goes, guys, that is such a white man's crime.  And we couldn't argue.  We're like, you're right.  When people profile for that type of crime, it is absolutely the white guy. 
[01:01:00]  Serial killing.  Serial killer, things like that.  But this type of thing, when you have an old lady that gets physically assaulted and robbed, for the most part, if you profile that, it's just going to be some degenerate black guy.  Yep.  There are definite crimes that fit certain races.  That's what it is.  Yeah.  That's why profiling, that's why they have profiling in crime.  Why can't they have it for other things?  Like airline hijacking and restaurants, water fountains. 
[01:01:30]  Neighborhoods.  Let's say hi to Paul in New York.  Paul, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are we doing this morning?  Let me tell you, right off the bat, we're going out to the city today.  Pack of five of us.  Going to go out and look.  The police were handing out pictures.  Can't tell, you know.  But another thing is, where's Al Sharpton?  How come Mr. Sharpton isn't out parading around, you know?  He's too busy bashing Barack Obama.  Oh, he's bashing Barack Obama? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, because he's got more publicity than Reverend Al does now.  Yeah, where is Reverend Al?  You know, he doesn't come out and say, we've got to catch this guy.  He's a threat to the community.  Who knows if this guy's beating up old black ladies or if he's just picking old white women.  Looks like, you know, the two that he hit with.  God help him if he gets caught.  You know, God help him if the police don't catch him.  You know?  And he ain't going to take three punches to knock his tail out.  Oh, a little vigilante-ism going on.  Nice.  Five of us are going on. 
[01:02:30]  Five guys.  They're just going to beat up the first black guy they find.  It's like the Bronx tale.  Hey, listen.  Yeah.  Patrice.  We're going to run him over with a cluster on Mermaronek and Mermaronek on the 95 exit ramp.  Yeah.  I don't think you're going to find a pink bicycle pedaling down the thruway.  Right.  He even admitted he doesn't even know what he looks like.  But listen, we're coming in anyways.  Yeah.  We're coming to get him.  I got police gave us a picture.  The city's outraged.  They're like, this guy.  Yeah.  They can't wait to find this guy.  Take care of the supreme race, fellas.  Have a great night.  Oh, my God. 
[01:03:00]  Wow.  Jesus.  Look at our fans.  Oh, my God.  Look at Anthony.  Look at Anthony.  He's lit up.  Anthony, calm down.  All right.  Stingray from the Bronx.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Big fan.  Love the show.  Thanks, Stingray.  Listen, animals treat each other better than this.  This guy is just a piece of garbage.  Animals don't do this to each other.  Yeah.  So you're really going to show up.  I think you should stop with the animal reference because it's a sin.  It really is.  And this guy is, you know, it's typically minorities and what they do and what they prey on. 
[01:03:30]  They prey on old white people, not to mention the five-year-old white girl that's down the  street that has no bicycle now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where's her pink bicycle?  Exactly.  I'm outraged.  He always stole that from somebody.  So it's just, you know, and, you know, anybody who's who's, I mean, this is why nobody  likes them.  You got to love that the old lady took three hits, though.  My God.  Yeah.  God bless her.  Exactly.  You got to be tough to live in these neighborhoods if you're white, you know?  You got to thank her husband for that.  Yeah, right. 
[01:04:00]  Probably.  Shut up.  Shut up, you dirty wench.  Dinner's late.  Wham.  This steak isn't cooked.  I could take a punch.  I was married for 60 years.  Yeah.  To Stephen McGillicuddy.  He was a merchant marine.  Come home from the bar and punch me in the face.  Back in the day.  Back in the old days.  Let's go.  We're back in the day again.  Ah, the good old days.  Where's dinner, you no good rotten bitch?  Well, I was out a little. 
[01:04:30]  Ah.  Ah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Ah.  Dad, don't hit mom.  Shut up, you little fat.  I'll punch you, too.  Oh.  Oh.  You see?  You see?  Yeah, you see?  You see?  I'm out working the docks all day.  And what are you doing around here?  Lollygagging around?  Oh, you do.  Why, I'll show you.  Yeah, you do.  Ah.  Shut up.  The neighbors are here.  You two-timing. 
[01:05:00]  You dumb bunny.  You two-timing.  Hey, Tommy, what are you doing over there?  Mind your own business and beat your own wife.  Okay.  Ah.  It's the 40s.  We're allowed to do this.  They're still second-class citizens, you see?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm just going to give you a pack of Chesterfields.  Yeah.  I'll be down at the store getting some lucky strikes.  And dinner better be on the table when I get back.  That's your only job, you see?  Now, take that with you. 
[01:05:30]  Where's the meatloaf?  Make sure I have a drink waiting for me when I come home.  You see?  You see?  You see?  I fought a war.  I still got Jerry Shrapnel in my ass.  You see?  I don't need your crap.  You see?  Ah!  Hey, guys, is that a black guy in our neighborhood?  Let's get him.  Raise war!  And then you fast forward three or four decades, and what do you got? 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  Yo, what's up, ladies?  Come out the door.  I got by my hairs and my chinny chin chin.  Could you hold the door for me, young man?  I've had a tough life.  I just want to go to church.  I've got to go to church and light a candle for St.  Oh!  That's right.  Take that.  Take that.  Oh, what did I...  What did I just...  I'm going to kick you in your liver, bitch.  I'm Tracy Morgan.  I'll punch you right in your liver. 
[01:06:30]  99 problems, but the bitch ain't won.  Well, she was a problem.  So, a third punch.  What a savage.  He is going to look stupid, though.  You know, she was probably just going to church, like you said, to light a candle for some  saint no one else has heard of.  How many saints are there, my God?  Trying to make her life a little better through prayer.  You see?  She was going to church to actually ask for forgiveness because she used the soap in an  improper way. 
[01:07:00]  Something like a back-alley abortion she had back in the old days that she's never been  able to forgive herself for.  Did you say old days?  Old school.  Johnny, I'm pregnant.  Well, I don't have any time for a kid.  You see?  A couple of punches to the gut ought to take care of Junior.  There's plenty of stems out there.  I don't need to be anchored down.  Look, I set things up with an old doc. 
[01:07:30]  He lives down the alley.  Go see him tonight at 10.  He'll take care of it.  Bring my WD-40.  His tools are a little rusty.  She's never been able to get over that, so she just lights a candle for the baby she never  had.  Go see Rosie.  Rosie the Riveter.  But, Johnny, I thought this would bring us closer together.  Closer.  Why, you crazy dame.  I'll bust both your stems. 
[01:08:00]  I'm going to Times Square and kiss some broad.  Right.  The war's over.  I'm going to get in my sailor suit and kiss a broad.  It's VJ day.  We beat those Japs.  One couple of punches for you, and I'm out the door.  Get my Cracker Jack uniform on.  I'm out of here.  Cracker Jack.  But, Johnny, what about the time we watch the submarine races?  Ah, go chase yourself.  Oh, go screw.  You see?  You lousy broad.  You're... 
[01:08:30]  Can't you see?  The war's over.  There are plenty of dames.  I don't need you no more.  Oh, but Johnny.  She's had a rough life.  I'm going to go kiss a dame in the Times Square.  So she's going to go to church because there's nothing on her head but the abortion and the  husband that she stood by that beat her every day.  And then, you know.  And then she's going to leave. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, no.  I can't get out the door, gentlemen, Sonny.  Could you...  Ah.  Oh.  It never ends.  Detroit players.  Jim's for my hula games in Brooklyn.  That's it.  All right.  I was only joking.  Yeah.  See, it's okay.  How much money did she have in her purse, by the way?  $30.  $30.  Exactly.  Something like that.  Yeah.  You know an old lady.  You know, why don't you beat up a yuppie?  You know, some Euro trash down in Soho.  Yeah, that's loaded.  Yeah, get a nice roll of hundreds from his Arab dad. 
[01:09:30]  You know.  Some old lady with $30 in change, by the way.  You got to actually roll pennies to get that money.  You got to open up that little change purse.  Yeah, with the little two snaps.  Yeah.  You squeeze it and it opens up like some private area.  The guy probably couldn't help himself because he's driving around the neighborhood in a pink  bicycle.  On a pink bicycle.  You know, he's the joker like the brothers.  Oh, my God.  Riding his pink bicycle.  Just always been a bad crook. 
[01:10:00]  Just a crackhead.  Well, they'll find him.  I guarantee by tomorrow's show.  Someone will turn him in.  Oh, absolutely.  That'll happen.  Well, if not, there's five guys walking around.  Yeah.  With red berets.  At least.  And red silk jackets.  Yeah.  You see?  Yeah.  That's going to make me laugh all day.  You see?  I see.  Look, Dame.  He tried to punch me, but Ed used to punch me much harder.  I ain't got time for you.  You know, I don't go down with one punch. 
[01:10:30]  He always told me I had moxie.  Moxie.  I don't know how the blacks hit their women, but the whites hit much harder.  Much harder.  I'm a merchant marine.  I'm going down to the social club, you see?  Yeah, yeah.  You stay here and cook.  The good old thing.  And do the laundry.  I'm going to tell you about boiled dinners, bitch. 
[01:11:00]  Ah, boy.  All right.  Kurt's very pissed off at us.  If he holds through the break, we'll talk to him.  We'll calm him down.  All right.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  There's way too much cock talk going on.  So let's bring the sexy back to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Today's boner is brought to you by Mr. Pete's Addicted to Anal. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Stay tuned for another edition of Today's Boner, only on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  We got Kurt from Dub Bronx.  Kurt, what's up today?  Yeah, I've been listening to you guys for a long time, man, like from 98.  But, like, the last couple of months, you guys just poured it out with the racism and just hating on everything.  Today was ridiculous. 
[01:12:30]  How is it ridiculous, sir?  Please explain.  Yeah, let's just stick with today.  This black guy hurt this woman.  It's ridiculous.  It's outrageous that he did this.  Yeah.  You lumped in every single black person, the entire borough of the Queens, basically because this idiot couldn't handle himself because this idiot did something ridiculous.  Dude, when it comes to punching every white suburban mom for Susan Smith killing her kids?  No, but as far as a profile goes, if a mom kills her kids, it's probably going to be a white woman. 
[01:13:00]  And if a serial killer is out on the loose, it's probably going to be a white guy.  Or a pedophile and child killer, it's probably going to be a white guy.  If an old woman is being punched in the face and robbed of her money, it's probably going to be a black guy.  That's all we're saying.  Why can't you speak?  You're going past that.  The next two callers you've got came on talking about the white race and how there's a pack of five of them going to...  Oh, well, what are we supposed to do?  That's not us.  It's callers.  I think it was pretty obvious that it was ridiculous that that guy is supposedly getting in a car with five buddies to find the dude. 
[01:13:30]  We were saying that he was an idiot for doing that.  It's a vigilante.  I said they're probably going to go after any black guy.  We were saying he's an idiot for doing it.  You didn't listen.  But you didn't say that before.  To my ears, listening to it, it was almost like you were advocating it.  You almost...  Advocating it?  The only way I'd advocate it is if they did find the guy and beat the crap out of him.  We were actually saying that how are you going to find the guy?  And five guys from wherever the frig they were walking the streets in New York.  Who cares?  What are they going to do?  What are they going to do?  Nothing. 
[01:14:00]  But they're going to look anyway.  And then if God forbid something happens in a couple of days where they do grab some black guy and beat the hell out of them,  then we've got another Howard Beach.  Oh, well.  What are you going to do?  That ain't going to happen.  The racists hate each other.  Because you guys, you know, it's sort of like you're detached from people that aren't white.  Nah, that's not...  There's a lot of us out there that are not white that aren't like this.  Yeah, I understand that.  Look, we had Patrice in on Friday.  That says it all.  Well, I know that.  We love the shwogi.  You know that.  Let me tell you something, my friend.  You know something? 
[01:14:30]  You're right.  People do feel detached when it's not your own race or sometimes religion.  People are just more familiar with people that they are the same as and people they hang out with.  But I'm sure, you know, you don't feel the same thing when things happen to white people than when they happen to black people,  if you're a black guy.  I'm not serious.  No, where's Reverend Al?  Why isn't Reverend Al talking about this and how horrible it is as far as the image of the community goes?  Where's any black leader coming out against this guy? 
[01:15:00]  I'll tell you why.  Because this country is still 90% white, and there's plenty of people out there speaking on behalf of white people.  I mean, for you too, for starters.  What happens?  What if it was the other way around?  Don't you think there'd be outrage in the community?  Yeah, Reverend Al should be out there going, this is outrageous and this doesn't represent the community and my people or our people or whatever the hell he says.  But using what you just said, you know, if people supposedly feel more comfortable around their own,  somebody's got to speak for those people that aren't hurt.  Well, it's making the black community look bad. 
[01:15:30]  It really makes young black men look worse than the situation that they're already in, and this is why.  It does if everyone lumps them all in.  You have to say that it was a black guy.  You have to have some type of paranoia because to be safe, okay?  This lady should have saw a black guy in her hallway, know that this guy doesn't belong there,  and maybe not go out of the house, maybe not get punched in the face.  Maybe this will save somebody else's, some other old lady will go, oh, there's a black guy in my hallway. 
[01:16:00]  The black guy just beat the crap out of the other two old ladies.  I'm not going out of my house and I'm calling the cops.  You can't take the risk because you don't want to be racist.  I'm not going to risk my life because I don't want to be racist and offend somebody like you, okay?  I don't want my grandmother, hey, I don't want to be racist and hurt anybody's feelings,  so I'll just go out and see if this black guy is a nice one or a bad one.  That woman, of course, should be careful.  Everybody should be careful. 
[01:16:30]  Not that woman.  Everybody.  Kurt, you don't understand.  In those situations, this is why people, you know, and I hear black guys talk about it all the time.  I walk past the car and I hear the locks go down.  Well, this is why.  It's not because nothing's happening.  It's because of things like this that white people get scared of young black males.  Right.  You think, Patrice says all the time, if I saw a bunch of bald guys, if I was in Kentucky  and saw a bunch of bald guys walking across, I'm not going to assume they have cancer.  He's going to run. 
[01:17:00]  That's what he says, okay?  Because he's street smart.  We live in New York City.  It's not 1920 and we're not black and white anymore.  It's in living color and people are getting killed and punched and stabbed everywhere.  It's in New York City, okay?  Not everywhere.  Wow.  Yeah, but let's not exaggerate it either.  If any, the crime numbers are way lower than they've ever been.  Oh, stop.  Hey, Kurt.  Do you have a pie chart in front of you?  Hey, Kurt, in the end, we're just...  If you live in New York, you don't.  I live in New...  What do you mean I don't live in New York?  I live in the very white section of New York.  Exactly. 
[01:17:30]  And the other guy...  And Anthony goes out in Suffolk someplace.  It's somebody's very, very state.  Hey, Kurt.  Suffolk.  I lived on 97th and Lex for four years.  Ah, it's below 100.  You're a puss.  It was.  Thank God.  I wouldn't move up like...  Hey, Kurt.  97th and Lex.  97th and Lex.  They need the bronze.  Kurt, you're blowing up our spot, though.  We were just having fun.  You gotta...  I know.  You gotta understand the music, the 40s music, working into the biggie, biggie, biggie  was kind of brilliant.  You know that, right?  Yeah, we had the old white guy beating up his wife.  Yeah, we had the old white guy beating up his wife coming home from the law.  Why don't you talk about spousal abuse? 
[01:18:00]  I'm the biggest ONA fan that I know.  All right.  It was just sometimes, like, this is one of the first times I've called him, because  it's just like, wow, that was a little thick today.  That's all.  Do you understand that now somebody can get offended about spousal abuse and call up and  say, well, that was wrong.  I don't care about the black stuff, but the spousal abuse stuff was wrong.  And then everybody can call up.  You gotta let some stuff go.  Relax.  And Kurt, we also were making fun of the old broad, but you didn't have a problem with  that.  Yeah.  She was getting beat up back in the day.  Well, I mean, I had a problem with that, too, but it was just more like when I came 
[01:18:30]  initially, it was more about a primarily in the race.  I mean, but at the same time, I understand.  You know, everything's got to be taken a certain level of lightness.  All right.  You know, you can't take everything associated.  And maybe you guys are going to take it too serious here.  All right, Kurt, more importantly, you did chuckle a little bit somewhere in there,  right?  What's that?  You chuckled a little bit, right?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  I listen to you guys every day.  I mean, obviously, there's something I'm liking about you guys.  At some point, it just comes off a little thick.  Like, and then when you've got those two callers in a row, talking about Supreme  race and... 
[01:19:00]  Oh, you're going to get that.  But we also put on...  Who is that girl that calls us all the time?  I love that broad.  Her racism.  The big afro.  Yeah.  You know, she's got one of those big afros.  She's like Angela Davis, angry.  And, you know, we put her on.  We put on anybody.  It's a phone...  You know, you could phone in and say whatever you want on this show.  Kurt, we didn't blow off your call.  We could easily have done it.  I know, and I appreciate it.  To be honest, I didn't think I'd be on this call.  We thank you for the call, and I guess we'll have to just agree to disagree.  Agree to disagree. 
[01:19:30]  All right.  Fuck out.  Obi, he's the...  Thanks, Kurt.  He's the type of person that annoys me.  What's the type of person that annoys you?  Oh, naggers, of course.  Naggers.  Right.  Nagger.  Nagger.  He nags.  Mm-hmm.  Right.  Should have seen that.  He just...  He just was a little angry.  He's a big fan of the show.  You know what, dude?  You can't pick and choose what you think is politically incorrect.  Just listen. 
[01:20:00]  You know, everybody knows that you guys don't hate people, don't hate certain races.  You know, I mean, you make fun of the gay guy.  Well, one out of two in this room does.  Yeah, that's true.  Anthony's hand did good.  When the guy went white power, Anthony's hand, he had to slap it down.  I live amongst the Jewish people.  He was making believe there was something important on the computer screen.  He was like...  He had to jam his hand in his pocket real quick.  He was trying to compose himself. 
[01:20:30]  I love all people.  We were just having fun.  That break was hilarious with the music change.  I love the era.  I'm a fan of the era.  Yeah, you punch a lady in the face.  You're okay with that.  So, yeah.  Beating the crap out of your kids and your wife is fine as a merchant marine.  Yeah, right.  Come on.  The old lady in the face.  You're going to lump everybody in.  But letting everybody know it was a black guy who beat the old lady up.  So, maybe some people can go, hey, man, don't go outside if there's a black guy in your vestibule. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  Oh, there's a man.  If the man in his 30s is in your vestibule, don't go outside.  Could you be a little more specific?  Okay.  A black guy.  Yeah, don't go outside today until we catch the guy.  Maybe be cautious.  You see a pink bicycle.  All right.  Screw that.  Let's have some fun.  Throw it.  Let's have some fun with Wake Up with Janet and Nick.  Oh, we got some clips?  I guess.  Are they good, Sam?  Sam, people are counting on this bit.  It's going strong still.  But I know you're going to blow it up.  We're going city by city and finding these shows that, for some reason, have some popularity. 
[01:21:30]  And they're awful.  Yeah.  They're what radio has become.  This safe, milquetoast, just garbage with the guy and the girl.  And they're yapping about something.  And I just thought of something.  Just like that thug punching the 101-year-old old lady.  Yeah.  We're going after the tough targets, too.  The tough targets.  It's these nice morning shows that are so nice.  You're going to suck a punch at old people.  Yeah, that's what we're doing. 
[01:22:00]  Here's the deal.  We've all seen the video by now.  Anthony and I, we're the thug with the pink bicycle.  And Janet and Nick, they're the 101-year-old lady.  Let's be real here.  Let's be honest.  See?  See, Kurt?  We're honest with each other here.  We're not taking on any toughies here.  No.  We're going for the very obvious and easy targets.  I just love these awful shows.  And this is an odd one because the girl's name is first.  Now, as a little hint, Sam, can you tell that she's billed first? 
[01:22:30]  It's not as emasculated for him as I was hoping.  Oh, really?  She definitely brings it from break.  Is she kind of a whole, though?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  That's all I care about.  Sam reminds me of that little Indian kid on American Idol.  What?  Sanji.  Oh, can you hula dance?  Yeah, can you hula dance for me, Sam?  Just a little bit.  Are you like Patrice?  You think the kid's kind of hot?  Kind of. 
[01:23:00]  Did you see they blew his hair out last week?  Yeah.  It was like straight down with highlights.  And they fixed his eyebrows and they trimmed that little Puerto Rican mustache off.  And his lips were like, oh, they put something on his lips.  Something to make him sheen.  See, you know.  Oh, he could be a cover girl.  There we go.  Patrice wants him gone.  He goes, I just want him out of my mind.  No, it's either Hamo or Annabella, that other girl from Korea.  Oh, yeah.  She's gone now, though.  She got an offer to do Girls Gone Wild for a quarter million dollars.  It's in the paper today.  She's got to get more than that.  A quarter million.  She's got to hold out. 
[01:23:30]  The guy's got a bunch of cash.  She's got to hold out for Playboy for a million dollars.  It will happen.  Oh, man.  I hope it happens to him, too.  This is something better than Playboy.  Maybe Swank.  Patrice had the best line, though.  He walks in on Friday.  He goes, I just want that kid kicked off American Idol so I could start the healing process.  Yeah, because it's making him think things that he just doesn't want to think about.  It's upsetting him about his sexuality, that he's finding him so attractive.  But he said that if you walked around hand in hand with that guy, you wouldn't be considered  gay because he's so feminine.  Can I tell you, though? 
[01:24:00]  Honestly, you could take him to a movie, sit right up front and pull that little arm thing  up and have him lean his head right on your shoulder.  Nobody would say anything about you.  And you're not gay.  I would actually, I wouldn't even have sex with him.  I would actually kiss him.  Like soft kiss.  Like a, like a, like, you know when you suck on the top lip and you let it pull off slowly  and the lip still sticks to it a little bit?  Like that?  Just soft kiss him.  And I would say to him something like this, hey, whatever you want to do is fine with me.  You just treat him like a really good girl. 
[01:24:30]  I'd treat him like the girl.  Like the, like the one.  The one.  I'd run around and open the car door for him.  Would you be proud to kind of show him to your friends and stuff?  Open the car door.  Show him to my friends.  At the comedy cellar, would you bring him down there?  No, no, no.  I don't want them messing with her.  I don't want, I don't want any of those guys, Tampa Sherrod, small, come up taking my  little, my little Indian princess away.  Oh.  Just like Patrice.  You guys are bent.  He is so cute. 
[01:25:00]  He is so cute.  You guys are.  His hair all blown out.  Stepping out.  That's the song.  That's the song Patrice was talking about.  I love it.  Stepping out with my baby.  Oh.  I'd fight Patrice for him.  I would.  But you're not gay, right?  No.  It's not really gay.  It's almost magical.  It's like unicorn and, you know what I mean?  Like, like, like minotaurs and cento.  It's like that magical world where it's not gay.  It's not gay.  It's just beautiful.  It's fantasy.  Fantasy.  Is what it is. 
[01:25:30]  If he, oh God.  He is sensational.  Look at him.  Would you take him for a ride in your convertible?  Convertible boy.  He could be a convertible boy.  Convertible boy.  He could be a convertible boy.  Exactly.  I wish he could sing it for me.  Convertible Sanjay.  You're so amazing.  Oh, look at the hair.  All right.  But look at the little nose matches the lips and the.  Look, we got to ban pictures of Sanjay or Sanjay or whatever the hell.  We got to ban them.  Yeah, it's too distracting. 
[01:26:00]  It's too distracting.  We got a radio show to do.  Oh, look.  There he is hooling.  Look at the body moves in like motion as one unit.  That's why.  No, it's great.  He's so proud to tell like 32 million people that he likes to hula.  Hula dance.  Look.  Look at him hula dancing.  Oh, and he does the little spin and his little kiss.  That kiss was to me, by the way.  In my world, don't ruin it.  That was to me.  Oh, my God. 
[01:26:30]  Look at that long neck.  Like a rockette.  All right.  All right.  All right already.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Now we got to take a break.  We'll get into some Janet and Nick audio.  See what they're going to hear.  It's all about Buffalo today.  Yep.  For some reason, Buffalo, Chicago, and New York City love the O&A show a little more than  some other cities.  Yeah.  And we appreciate that.  So we'll talk.  We'll do the Janet and Nick thing.  We got the Richard Jenny uncomfortable audio and some other things to go. 
[01:27:00]  Don't forget, tomorrow we announce the first date of the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Tour.  Yeah.  Nine or ten more dates to follow.  Is it going to be in your city?  Mm-hmm.  Ah.  Ah.  Ah.  Well, you got to think we're going somewhere warm because this show is happening in April.  Yep.  So there's your first hint.  At four in the morning.  Huh?  It's happening in April at four in the morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern. 
[01:27:30]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It sure is.  The Opie and Anthony show.  That old music is going to make me laugh all day, man.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Bob Kelly in studio today helping us out.  He's playing the Addison Improv this coming weekend for everybody in the Dallas area. 
[01:28:00]  All right.  Back to Janet and Nick.  Taking a look at this Janet and Nick show from Buffalo.  Yeah, another one of these guy-girl yuck fests.  They just sit there all morning and gab about how marriage is.  But it's nice, you know, not like the way we talk about marriage.  And puppy dogs. 
[01:28:30]  And they play games.  Well, what are they doing on their show today?  Well, one of their big bits is a listener calls up and you know how a lot of shows have trivia questions or somebody gets to win a prize?  Sure.  The SATs were on Saturday.  Oh.  So they're asking SAT questions.  Ah, see, they tied that in.  This is a joke, right?  No.  Sam is so cute.  No.  No.  No.  Stepping out. 
[01:29:00]  No.  My baby.  All right.  We leave our staff alone.  I can't help it.  You're a predator when you come in here.  You're supposed to just be doing the show with us.  A predator.  You really are, man.  So, Bob Kelly, you've come to the radio show for sex.  Well, no.  I just came here.  You're here to meet this young man?  Ah, yeah, I guess.  You came in.  No, take a seat.  Don't go anywhere.  Take a seat.  Okay.  Might as well finish your lemonade.  Yeah, well, it's good. 
[01:29:30]  Now.  You want a cookie?  If you have one.  You've said, and I'll read the transcript here, you wouldn't mind taking him to the movies  and soft kissing him on the lips.  I just, I heard that he felt a little lonely and I just wanted to give him a little fetch.  Now, you're talking about a young man.  You obviously want to have sex.  Yeah, I can't deny it.  Yes, I want to have sex with him.  I want to make out with him and I want to make him money.  By the way, Sanjay is like 17.  Well, who wouldn't?  He's underage.  Is he?  Yeah.  Now it's all perfect.  You predator. 
[01:30:00]  Now it's perfect.  Is he really underage?  Yes.  Sam, what are you?  I'm 23.  I want to get you a little straight wig with highlights.  Fine.  I just want to put clothes pins on that upper lip and fluff it up a little bit.  Fluff it up.  He's got candy in his head, too.  Yeah.  I don't.  Oh, you haven't heard that one yet?  Just go figure out how to get it out.  I forgot about it.  Yeah, Steve is convinced he's got candy in his head.  I know.  I forgot.  I know.  Well, we can't find the secret lever.  I bit his cheek.  Oh, that's right.  You did bite his cheek.  That made me a predator.  I see. 
[01:30:30]  He sat on your lap.  Can I just say something?  He looks like one of those wooden puppets from those little Christmas.  That's what I mean.  Remember the Christmas thing?  Remember they had the little rosy cheek?  A marionette?  Yes.  It's like a marionette.  We're misfits.  I want to be a dentist.  All right.  Here we go.  I want to be Sanji.  All right.  Enough.  God, I hope he gets kicked off this week better. 
[01:31:00]  All right.  Janet and Nick.  Here we go.  So Sam got a few clips together just so we could get to know the Janet and Nick  show from Buffalo.  Yeah.  Janet and Nick ask an SAT question.  Oh, I can't wait.  All right.  We're going to do an SAT question, Rachel, because the SATs were on Saturday.  Oh, good luck.  Sure.  Okay.  Good luck.  This is an official SAT question of the day.  We'll give you an easy one here.  Gasoline tank on a certain tractor holds 16 gallons of gasoline.  If the tractor requires seven gallons to plow three acres, how many acres can the tractor 
[01:31:30]  plow with a tank full of gasoline?  Would that be six and six, seven?  Hold on.  Wait.  With how much of a tank?  With a full tank of gasoline.  With a full tank of gasoline?  Yeah.  Holy crap.  A full tank and a full tank holds what?  Oh, curse.  16 gallons with 16.  You want to laugh on the way to work.  14.  You want to be reminded of school and that anxiety you used to get taking a test.  I really did just get stressed out.  I just realized how stupid I am.  Right.  Something.  I'm trying to do math.  Don't do it.  Not even helping. 
[01:32:00]  A full tank of gasoline.  With a full tank of gasoline.  He was talking so fast.  That's right.  Yeah, it talks a lot.  The tractor holds 16 gallons of gas.  Okay, and the acre, and how many acres?  The tractor requires seven gallons to plow three acres.  Okay.  Seven gallons.  How many acres?  Oh, gosh.  No, it's easy.  It's easy.  6.2.  Oh, my God.  6.3.  I really don't.  Are you actually, Opie, that stresses me out like school.  6.4.  6.5.  Stop him, please.  It gives me anxiety.  You don't have to impress people all the time.  You can't do it.  6.5.  Just be with the rest of us.  We all have a little anxiety. 
[01:32:30]  I don't know.  This is not what you want from your morning show going to work.  I don't know the point.  You're stressed out and have those, like, dreams like you're still in school.  I'll just say a little over 6.  Why?  Because why does it have to be so exact?  Why do this to everybody?  Why?  Who cares?  Just get me my corn.  All right.  Well, and the next clip, because we're getting to know Janet and Nick.  Janet and Nick sound like idiots. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, okay.  No, wait.  Read the question one more time.  Gasoline tank on a certain tractor holds 16 gallons of gas.  If the tractor requires seven gallons to plow three acres, how many acres can the tractor  plow with a tank full of gasoline?  Oh, easy.  Seven gallons.  Three acres.  Is it six and two-thirds or something?  Six and a third or six and a fourth?  How many acres?  Seven acres?  Three acres, he said.  Three acres.  But the question is, how many acres can the tractor plow with a tank full of gasoline? 
[01:33:30]  With 16.  And take seven gallons.  Two and two gallons.  Oh, my God.  My head's exploding.  Two sixteens and one-eighth.  What's the choices?  The choices are six and six-sevenths.  No.  Seven and one-sixth.  Oh, I'm right.  Seven and a third.  Ten and two-thirds.  Or 37 and a third acres.  Oh, geez.  What were the first two next?  Six and six-sevenths.  How does that work? 
[01:34:00]  Or seven and one-sixth.  How does that work?  These were the first two.  You were pretty close right on the get-go.  Oh, I don't care.  Oh, you almost said it right from the beginning.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  He's up back there.  I don't care.  Hello, exactly.  Oh, my God.  I'm all stressed out.  Wow.  I have a pain in the right side of my hip right now.  I'm not even kidding you.  No one wants to be reminded of school after you leave school. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is there an organ in the right side of your hip right now?  I have a pain.  It is hurting.  It's on the right side of my hip right now.  I'm not kidding you.  That made something explode.  Oh, is that awful?  There used to be an organ there, but now it's all stomach, isn't it, Bob?  Wow.  Wow.  You didn't have to go too far with that one, did you, Ope?  Did you have to stare at my belly when you said it?  Could you at least look me in the eye?  Yeah, there used to be an organ there.  Now I'm going to lose weight.  Watch what happens.  How many gallons were in the tractor?  I don't care.  You need to really know the answer now. 
[01:35:00]  And there were seven gallons?  In the tractor?  Why would your morning show do this to you?  They're playing Indian music in the background, too, which is killing me.  Double that, though.  It's 14.  It's not even a full tank.  So three, six is only 14.  Seven.  It's 6.857.  I need a math.  Is that what it is?  I was a math whiz growing up.  Who gives a crap?  I gave a crap because someone was saying it's over seven, Anthony, you idiot. 
[01:35:30]  And I knew it wasn't over seven.  No, it's 6.857, but who's keeping track?  Who cares?  Apparently you are, Einstein.  I knew the whole time.  That's why you can sit here and be so nonchalant.  Me and poor Anthony are like 6, 7, 2, 2, 2, 3, 7.  I kind of knew math when I was growing up.  Who cares, though?  But you don't really get a full tank on a full tank, so I'm just saying 7.5, 6.5.  Dude, I got anxiety now. 
[01:36:00]  I never get anxiety.  I get anxiety when it comes to school crap.  All right, did you get a clip where you make them funnier and bring them into our world?  Yeah, I want to hear fun.  All right, so we got Janet and Nick's Code Cracker Contest.  What the hell is this?  Well, you have to call up and give them a three-digit number, and if it matches their three-digit number on their briefcase, you win a vacation.  Oh, that sounds easy. 
[01:36:30]  What's the number between 111 or 100 and 999?  All right, so what happens if I say 275?  They'll check the first number and see if it's right.  And then they'll check the second number and see if it's right.  And what if the first number's wrong?  And then you lose.  And then what if 2 and 7 are right?  And then the next people, like the next nine people, will win, maybe. 
[01:37:00]  Is this show beating us in Buffalo?  I don't know the numbers.  Probably.  All right, here they talk about their Code Cracker Contest.  Crack that code.  Kelly from Lakeview, are you there?  Yes, I'm here.  All right, Kelly, here's how it works.  The KISS 98.5 code is a three-digit code.  Each number is between 0 and 9.  It's a combination lock to a KISS 98.5 suitcase.  Inside the suitcase holds your free vacation.  Are you ready to crack the code, Kelly?  I am ready.  Who's helping you crack the code today? 
[01:37:30]  My daughter, Olivia.  Okay, so she's the Code Cracker?  She needs help.  Yeah.  Okay.  Good luck.  We need three numbers, please.  7-0-4.  Oh.  7-0-4.  Sounds like a good number.  You think that's going to crack the code?  I'm excited.  I hope so.  Let's do it.  Let's run down.  Now, the first digit you chose, number 7 is wrong.  Oh.  Kelly, that means no trip for you right now. 
[01:38:00]  Man, and you think we waste time on this show.  What a waste of time.  You hear the music, though?  It's all ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Code Cracker.  You have to download their Code Cracker worksheet to do it at home.  A worksheet?  You're the early morning show that gives you homework.  I need a worksheet.  Like we goof and say you got homework.  It's like Christmas Story.  You got to get the Code Cracker ring.  Go to the bathroom.  You got the coded ring.  Your mother's screaming at the head, get out of there.  He needs the bathroom.  Drink Ovaltine. 
[01:38:30]  This show stinks.  They give you SAT questions, and they give you a homework assignment.  You got to do math on this show.  This show is a math show.  Stinks.  Well, we're going to bring them into our world, the shock jock world, Janet and Nick.  So you took the same clip and made it edgier and funnier, right?  Yes.  Made it entertaining?  Yes.  All right.  Let's take a listen here.  You have confidence?  Yes.  Because if this sucks, then the bit's over.  We do this until the bit, you know, fails miserably.  I have confidence. 
[01:39:00]  All right.  Good.  Kelly from Lakeview, are you there?  Yes, I'm here.  All right, Kelly.  Here's how it works.  The KISS 98.5 is a combination lock to a KISS 98.5 suitcase.  Inside the suitcase holds your free...  Are you ready to...  Kelly?  I am ready.  Who's helping you...  Who's helping you...  To...  Today?  My daughter, Olivia.  Okay.  So she's the...  Yeah.  Okay.  Good luck.  We have three numbers, please. 
[01:39:30]  704.  704.  You think that's going to be a KISS?  I hope so.  Let's do it.  Let's run down.  The first digit you chose, number seven...  KISS is wrong.  I'm sorry, Kelly.  That means no KISS for you right now.  Wow.  That Olivia is a beeper.  Crazy.  All right.  Bits still on. 
[01:40:00]  Game's still on.  Game's still on.  That was a good one.  There's stupid Janet and Nick in good old Buffalo.  You should come in here one day and just do one of those shows.  I was thinking that.  Like, really just plan.  Do the prep for the whole day and just do an awful one of those shows.  Have a chick come in.  Yeah.  You guys, from the get-go, from here until XM, do that.  Just really stay in character and commit.  Fully commit to it and do games and little witty things and traffic alerts and weather and... 
[01:40:30]  Oh.  And just do it.  All right.  We got a lot of calls coming in from Buffalo.  We got Chris.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, my name...  Yeah.  I don't listen to them guys.  I listen to you guys all the time.  Shred and Reagan used to make fun of these guys all the time.  Oh, good.  So we're on to something here.  Yeah.  The dude's name is...  The guy...  His nickname is...  It's Janet and Nicholas Pickles in the morning.  Pickles?  Nicholas Pickles.  As in pickle?  Yeah, as in pickle.  So the guy likes pickles? 
[01:41:00]  I have no idea.  Or he's pickle-less.  He's got no...  Or he has no pickle.  Yeah, he's a great...  I know he's a guy.  Or he has a little gherkin.  It's a little pickle.  He likes little pickle.  A little smaller than a pickle.  It's possible.  But Shred and Reagan used to make fun of him about how he used to sit on a marital aid  with the word butt and the word plug in it.  Wow.  Jesus.  Chris, you know how this works in a while?  Wow, you're camouflaged.  Wow, you're really creative. 
[01:41:30]  You know...  Oh, whatever.  Jesus, Chris.  Thank you.  Butt, underscore...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Underscore.  Yeah, as long as you underscore it.  All right, enough.  Let's go to Jay in Buffalo.  Jay, what's up?  Jesus, dude.  Jay.  Jamie?  Hi, Jamie.  Yeah, what's up, Jamie?  Yeah, this Nicholas Nicholas guy.  He, like, MCs the Sabres games.  Every time this guy talks, everybody in the crowd just boos for him, you know?  The guy's just...  They boo him at Sabres games?  And he has a popular morning show in Buffalo? 
[01:42:00]  Yep.  Every time he talks, he just boo.  What a dope.  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  The team's doing well.  Are they?  Yeah, that would have been funny if they sucked.  I'm not a big hockey fan.  All right, moving on to other things.  We'll be keeping track of Janet and Nick all week.  Richard Jenney killed himself over the weekend.  Godspeed, Richard Jenney.  Godspeed.  You know who else died over the weekend and was, like, the tiniest blurb deep in the paper?  Brad Delp from Boston. 
[01:42:30]  From the band Boston.  The lead singer of Boston died.  I guess natural causes.  He was around 55 years old.  They found him dead at his home.  He was a great guy.  He played one of our Christmas parties back in the day.  I saw them three times.  Back in the older days.  Huh?  I saw them three times.  Remember when they made that little comeback with Amanda?  Yeah.  That was third stage, right?  Yeah, something like that.  Yeah.  They played 10 years for their second album.  They played Boston, like, 20 times because they're from Boston. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  And I saw them, like, three times.  They're great.  They're a great band.  Boston's first album was one of the greatest rock albums of all time.  And this band never got the respect it deserved because the album was made in Tom Schultz's basement.  He's like a genius, right?  Yeah.  He was, like, just an engineering genius.  Way before people were making albums in their basement, he was doing it.  Yeah.  Because he was an engineering student or whatever from MIT, I believe.  Yeah.  And then they couldn't really replicate that sound on stage.  No.  And it was very hard to do, all those harmonies. 
[01:43:30]  It was still great, though.  Well, the harmonies were just Brad's voice.  Yeah.  Overdubbed.  Yeah, a million times.  So, fast forward a few years.  Anthony and I are working at WAF in Boston.  And we go to the Christmas party.  And they got this band playing Beatles songs.  Like, ah, this is kind of cool for a Christmas party.  And everyone's just getting hammered and, you know, going up to the buffet.  And this band's playing in the corner Beatles songs.  It was Brad Delp.  Jeez.  Yeah, he was singing Beatles songs.  Of Boston fans.  Anthony ended up doing a song with them?  Yeah.  It was cool. 
[01:44:00]  You know?  He was the nicest guy.  Brad Delp.  This business sucks.  But he died, and it was like the tiniest blurb in the paper.  He was doing Christmas parties, singing Beatles songs.  He was into the band.  It was called Beetlejuice, I believe, or something like that.  Wow.  So.  That's terrible.  And he got no news.  I mean, it was barely, you know, if somebody didn't tell me, I wouldn't have known.  Barely a blip on the old radar screen.  And also, Richard Jenney, we have some history with Richard Jenney over the years. 
[01:44:30]  He took some kind of firearm, some kind of gun to his face in the shower.  Told his girlfriend he was taking a shower.  Next thing you know, she hears the blast.  Yeah.  Runs into the bathroom in the shower.  There he is.  He's still alive.  Oh, man.  He died in the hospital.  Wow.  Ow.  That's got to sting more than soap in your eyes.  Jesus, I'm just saying.  Dude.  Do you know Brad Delp, if he would have died, like, right after the first Boston album came 
[01:45:00]  out, he would have been, like, that status.  Yeah.  Where people would have still talked about him, and, like, that Jim Morrison status, and Hendrix,  and all those dead rock stars.  Kirk Mayne.  Leonard Skinner, and all that crap.  He'd have been right there, because that album was giant.  That was like that, and Frampton Comes Alive back then were, like, the biggest albums ever,  ever, ever.  It's one of those albums where every song was great. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah.  There's not many albums you could actually say that.  And everyone had that album.  Unless you're, like, an Uber fan, you could argue some album that the rest of the country  would disagree with.  But as far as Boston goes, that first album, there wasn't a bad song on it.  Everyone had it, too.  Yeah.  Everyone I know owned that album.  That logo was great, too, on the front.  Yeah, the flying saucer thing, or whatever it was.  You know that Boston tried to make a comeback in 2002?  Nah.  Really?  I think the album was called Corporate, or something.  Oh, right, yeah.  Corporate America, or I don't know. 
[01:46:00]  Man.  But it went absolutely nowhere.  No, they were banned for their time.  So now he dies, and it's like...  And no one knows.  Or cares, it seems like.  On the timing.  Jesus.  You should care that Brad Delp is dead.  Yeah.  No one does.  Oh, it's terrible.  Richard Jennings and Brad Delp in the same day.  How did he just die of heart attack?  I don't know.  They said natural causes, so...  Gotta think maybe heart.  Well, because, you know what?  Suicide is a little...  When a celebrity just passes away or whatever, but when a guy shoots himself in the face, 
[01:46:30]  that's like, wow.  Especially a comic, because a comic's supposed to just be...  We take all our pain, and that, and we, you know...  You're working out on stage, or try to.  You guys are all miserable and dark inside.  Who are you kidding?  Yeah, we're all miserable.  We all want to kill ourselves, but we go on stage...  You're all one bad set away from doing exactly what Richard Jennings did.  One bad set this weekend in Addison Improv.  Yeah.  All right.  You're learning.  Nice.  It's just crazy, though, because he was still making... 
[01:47:00]  If you look on the internet, to hire Richard Jennings, it's still $20,000 to $30,000 a show.  Really?  So it's not like he didn't have money, you know?  Well, there's rumors that he had some kind of medical condition that he was frustrated over.  That's not us saying it.  It made the story...  I don't know what it could be.  I don't know.  We'll find out in the coming days, I guess.  I got to take a leak.  So can we play the Richard Jennings stuff after the break?  Sure.  He was on our show.  We made him do a prison visit, and we had some problems with him, but then we worked it out. 
[01:47:30]  We actually worked it out, and he called our show after this audio you're going to hear  after the break, because this is brutal stuff.  This is really brutal stuff.  So it's going to be uncomfortable.  But what happened, one of the things that happened, we had a great time with Richard Jennings,  and he came in, and we had a nice little visit, and everything was cool.  And then he goes on Howard's show and has to drink the Kool-Aid over there when Howard's  talking about his imitators and this and that, all of a sudden Richard Jennings, instead 
[01:48:00]  of not saying anything, is like, yeah, yeah, you're 100% correct.  And I think we were even referred to.  And I'm like, what are you doing?  You were on our show.  If you felt that way, you should have said something to our face, first of all.  And then you go on Howard's show and let him spew all that BS, whatever.  I'm not saying that if Howard wants to say all that, then so be it.  But you don't have to sit there and agree with him right after you had a great time with  us on our show.  That's what started the whole thing.  So it got really ugly with us and Richard Jennings. 
[01:48:30]  And then, honestly, by the end, we worked it out with him, and he did call our show.  He called us over at XM, matter of fact, less than a year ago, and we had a good corner  with the guy.  Good thing we have closure.  I heard he had problems with the guy.  We had closure with the guy.  He had problems with the internet, too.  He was reading stuff on the internet, on websites, and people trashing his comedy and trashing  him, and you know, and you can't, I'm telling you, as a performer, you cannot read anything  on the internet.  You can't do it because you're going to read one good thing and be like, wow, that's great, 
[01:49:00]  and then you're just going to get trashed by some dummy who doesn't even know you, or  doesn't like you, and you're going to want to kill yourself.  Oh, now you don't know who's the post that put him over the edge.  Someone out there is the poster that put him over the edge.  Probably somebody on Whack Bag.  Who didn't even really mean it, was just kidding around, but doesn't have the right  busting balls.  Just comes off as mean-spirited.  Yeah, because you get those emails, MySpace, some guys just trash you, you suck, I hate 
[01:49:30]  you, you know, I hope you die, and then you get like an email, I'm just kidding, dude,  I love your work, oh, one rocks.  You're like, what?  I had a gun to my face.  Thank God I refreshed my MySpace page, and I got your next email.  So we'll take a break, we'll play some uncomfortable moments from Richard Jenney on our show, and  we also got to get into the banning of the boo.  Are people taking away Carlos Mancia's guns?  What?  Jesus, he's not depressed. 
[01:50:00]  He's taking a lot of heat these days.  I'm trying to think if that was a reach or not.  He's not taking heat.  Poor Joe's taking heat.  Nah, Joe ain't taking heat.  Joe beat up anybody that gets some heat.  Joe's a tough bastard, man.  Joe will really choke you out.  We're going to make an announcement tomorrow, the first O&A comedy stop, comedy tour stop,  and Joe Rogan is part of it.  Really?  Yeah.  Last one was, Carlos Mancia was part of the last one.  We got Joe Rogan for the O&A traveling virus. 
[01:50:30]  Why don't you get both of them on one show?  That'd be a him fight at the end.  That'd be fun.  That'd be great.  Put them right in the middle of a pit.  Blindside both of them.  Just drop them both down.  Send them both out on the stage at the same time, not knowing that the other one's coming  from one side and one's coming from the other.  Put their jokes in a notebook in the middle of the ring, and whoever gets to the notebook  gets the jokes.  Give it to Rogan.  Rogan's an animal.  He is.  He's solid.  His fists are like catches mitts.  All right, listen.  My body temperature's dropping.  I got to hit that bathroom. 
[01:51:00]  You ever have to go so bad you feel your body temperature dropping?  I'm at that point.  I'm like, what a cool dopey.  I'm actually shivering.  I got to get behind you in a minute here.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Virus.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bob Kelly in studio.  Another comic that's doing the O&A traveling virus. 
[01:51:30]  Yes.  We're going to have one of many announcements tomorrow.  We announce one of the shows tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony Show.  And Bob Kelly, along with Joe Rogan, will be performing at that show.  That'd be crazy.  Ooh.  All right, let's get into that.  Little clues here and there.  Richard Jenner, yes.  Kind of an old friend.  We had our differences with the guy.  In the end, it was cool between us. 
[01:52:00]  Absolutely.  I do remember he did call the XM show, and we kind of ignored all the past crap.  Yeah.  But we do have a few clips.  Got past it.  Very quick clips.  He's a comic comic, though.  He's not like a...  Like back in the 80s, you were a comic.  You wrote jokes.  You set up Punch Tag, and that was him.  Mm-hmm.  Punch Tag.  Yeah, that's him.  Now, comics are up there.  It's a different style of comedy now.  Yeah.  There's a whole different genre out there now, just going up there and telling true stories 
[01:52:30]  and making it funny and edgy and crazy, and it's all real.  So Platypus Man wasn't real?  No, it wasn't.  Sorry.  Platypus Man.  Well, that's a Richard Jenner thing.  I know it is.  Oh, okay.  I was hoping you did.  I'm like, Jesus.  I like Ray Jenny.  But we got some uncomfortable moments.  We made him do a prison visit.  We didn't think he was worthy enough to come into our studio,  so we actually did the interview through glass as he was staring through the door 
[01:53:00]  with his cell phone.  Yeah, it was really, really uncomfortable.  I love how you guys honor the dead.  I really...  Yeah, this is our honoring.  Most other people are doing, like, playing some of his bits  and then tailing out with some stuff when he was on.  Hey, guys, thanks for having me.  You guys honor the dead by playing when you made him do a prison interview.  It's called a prison visit.  Richard Jenner, we just played a little for you.  Tragedy, as you heard.  The death of Richard Jenner. 
[01:53:30]  That was bloody.  That was man.  Continuing all day with bits.  And now here's when we made him talk through a window to us  because we told him he wasn't funny  and made him talk through a window on his cell phone  and then mocked him every word out of his mouth as not being funny.  Well, the clip after this is even worse, though.  Oh, God.  Where we actually played his comedy and mocked him in front of his face.  I don't know if I want to hear this  because I don't know if I want to, like, start feeling guilty about...  Like, is this what kind of did it? 
[01:54:00]  Did he think about this?  Trust me, when I heard the news, I'm like,  all right, yeah, we made up with him.  Okay.  Did we make a...  Did Iraq play that in Best Of at one point, like, recently,  where maybe he heard it?  Look what Iraq writes, by the way.  Opie is the one who's brutal on this.  Really?  Of course it is.  Oh, I really thought it was Anthony.  Back in the old days.  Really thought this time it was going to be Anthony. 
[01:54:30]  I don't know how many times Anthony had to shrug his head and go,  ah, that's just how he is.  I was just being a good cop.  I'd have to play a good cop.  No, I just mean in your everyday life.  Oh, yeah.  That's just how he is.  Well, what are you going to do?  I hope you had to think if he was responsible for somebody's death.  Yeah.  No, we made up.  Okay, cool.  All kidding aside, when I heard, when Iraq told me, he was the one,  I'm like, oh, my God.  And then I'm like, oh, that's right, we did make up with him. 
[01:55:00]  And we actually had a very nice phone conversation with him over at Exxon.  Good.  A normal one, like you call up the show and you're treated nice.  Right, right, right.  You mind ripping the pages of his book out?  No.  That's not my bit.  But it's a brilliant bit.  I wish I could take credit for that one.  All right, here we go.  Richard Jenney doing a prison visit back in the day.  Hello.  Who's this?  This is Richard Jenney.  Who's this?  Richard Jenney.  Hey, by the way, I...  Voice from beyond.  By the way, we knew it was Richard Jenney.  We're looking at him.  I answered the phone and I still have to go and make believe. 
[01:55:30]  Who is this?  Who is this?  As I'm looking right at him through a glass.  Oh, this is so bad, dude.  Oh, man, I get shivers.  I know.  Do you hear his voice?  Now he's dead.  You're giving me douche shivers.  Hello.  Who's this?  This is Richard Jenney.  Who's this?  Richard Jenney.  Hey, Richard, it's Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Opie and Anthony.  How are you?  Good.  How are you doing?  Good?  I'm just peachy.  Thanks.  When are you coming in?  I was thinking about coming in today.  Today?  Yeah, I'm really close by. 
[01:56:00]  Where are you?  I'm actually staying in the lobby.  You're outside the studio?  Yeah, I've been staying in the lobby.  I didn't want to miss you guys.  And you want to come in and do the show?  Yeah.  You want to do a prison visit?  Do I want to do a what?  A prison visit.  No, why would I want to do a prison visit?  Well, that's where you're on the phone like you are now, and then you step up to the glass  on the door to the studio?  Right.  And you talk that way?  No, I'm not doing that. 
[01:56:30]  Come up to the glass.  It'll be fun.  It's like Oz.  Why can't I just come in?  I can't just come in the studio?  Are you worried about germs or something?  We're going to have Ron Jeremy in.  That was really funny.  That thing yesterday was really funny.  What thing?  The thing where you kept hanging up on me.  Oh, yeah.  It would be funny if we hung up on you right now.  No, I think it gets old.  It gets old after a while.  Yeah, it does.  This is our new game.  You're 15 feet away, and we're making you call us on the telephone. 
[01:57:00]  At first, I was pissed off, and then I just started cracking up.  It was so juvenile.  Were you really mad?  At first, I was.  What the hell was that?  How could they do it?  And then I just go, that is just so asinine.  I have to laugh at it.  But if you're going to get mad at something like that, maybe you shouldn't be on our show  because we're juvenile.  Well, it's up to you.  I was hoping you put me on.  Did you have to end it on that?  Did you have to end it on, hey, it's up to you.  I was just hoping.  I was hoping you put me on.  This has hurt my heart. 
[01:57:30]  I cry with midgets.  Never mind.  Are you all right, Bob?  Oh, God.  I got to get Bob a tissue.  Get him some tissue.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that was.  You might not want to hear the next bit, then.  Dude, he just said, oh, well, you know.  Oh, well.  Well, the day before, we kept hanging up on him.  Thanks.  Why were we hanging up on him, E-Rock?  You know all this crap.  Do you remember?  This crap.  No, that part, I'm not too sure.  I'm still looking on that one.  Probably because we were just in a bad mood that day.  Yeah, and he probably was, like, maybe doing a little too much of his act, maybe. 
[01:58:00]  I don't remember.  All right, I think the next phoner, if I'm not mistaken, this is from a different visit  when he called us, right?  Same visit.  Same visit?  Same visit.  Huh.  All right, let's just play it.  Screening Richard's comedy for humor.  Are you going to be funny, Richard?  Yeah, I'll be funny.  Oh, I know what this is.  Okay.  No, because then, all right.  This is still the prison visit, and we're not really sure if we want him in studio, so 
[01:58:30]  we want him to try out some of his material as he's looking at us through the glass.  He had to audition from the lobby.  And if we thought he was funny, then we'd bring him into the studio.  I was thinking of the other time when he put out the 9-11-type comedy CD about six months  after the towers went down.  And this was after he was on Howard's show, kind of agreeing with Howard's BS.  Right.  I'm like, all right, well, now we're going to have some real fun.  And we were actually playing parts of the CD as he's on the phone, and then basically 
[01:59:00]  saying, so you really think that's funny?  Oh.  There wasn't a laugh to be had.  Oh, it's brutal.  And he was even trying to get the crowd motivated by going, hey, how about America?  You know, just going for the cheap, everyone has to cheer, because who doesn't like America  type stuff?  Hope, are you forgetting this man's dead?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hope he's just going off like he's still around.  He just screwed him, and he's out in the hallway.  I got him on the phone. 
[01:59:30]  Hang on one second.  Hey, what's going on?  It's Rich.  Pretty good, Rich, right?  We're remembering the life of Richard Jennings today.  Stop.  So through the glass, more of the prison visit.  We're not sure if we should let him into the actual studio.  Make him audition.  Are you going to be funny, Richard?  Yeah, I'll be funny.  Well, I'm sold.  I'm sold.  Not to put the pressure on you or anything.  I'll be funny.  Like, what's the first joke you're going to tell on the air?  Stop it.  You're totally putting him on the spot here. 
[02:00:00]  Any riffs on things in the news?  There's lots of riffs on whatever you want to talk about.  Yeah?  But I got to be in the studio to do them.  I'm not funny in the lobby.  Yeah.  So you got any knock-knock jokes?  He's laughing at the juvenile stuff again.  Knock-knock.  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  What's your name?  Uh-oh.  Richard Jenny.  Richard Jenny who?  Richard Jenny, you're hearing knock-knock because I'm pistol whipping Opie and Anthony. 
[02:00:30]  Get it?  Richard Jenny who?  Oh, sorry.  Hi, Richard.  Oh, man.  Oh, God.  You are so responsible.  What?  You are so responsible for him killing himself.  That was actually a funnier line.  Opie was right.  I was just mad that no one, like, you know, gave me a little love for that line.  Richard Jenny who?  Exactly.  Oh, is that horrible?  Sorry.  All right, Richard. 
[02:01:00]  Can you give us a few minutes to think about it?  Oh, God.  Yeah, think it over.  Can you stop ending on this tragic note?  What?  Yeah, think it over.  Look at E-Rock laughing his ass off over there.  He's loving it.  He's loving it.  Think it over.  Go ahead, guys, I guess.  I don't know.  I'm thinking things over, too.  I got a couple things on my mind I'm thinking over, but go ahead.  E-Rock thinks about that .44 caliber bar of soap every day of his life.  Oh, my God. 
[02:01:30]  E-Rock, what's the third clip about?  And the final clip, Bob.  Third clip is you finally let him into the studio.  All right, so it ended up nice.  Yeah.  Up note.  Did it?  Wait, dude.  We'll have to see.  Did it end nice?  No.  No.  It didn't end nice?  Why would it?  I thought because the guy died.  We were going to actually do something a little different today.  It actually ended the bit nice.  It doesn't end nice?  The bit didn't end nice.  Oh, no.  I swear to God, I don't remember this. 
[02:02:00]  All right, so we let him in the studio.  Let's see what happens.  Dad.  There he is.  He looks like he's going to kill us.  Richard Jenny.  Come here.  Sit down, man.  Are you doing this or not?  Oh, no.  Come on.  It's all fun.  Richard Jenny.  How are you?  Aren't you a good sport, Richard?  That's Opie over there.  I'm Anthony.  Uh-oh.  He looks all uptight.  What's the matter?  You'd spend too much time.  You're wasting time, right?  It's like a waste of time.  See, now you've got to be funny.  No.  After we just pissed you off.  He looks all pissed.  Here, get on the mic. 
[02:02:30]  It's just, let's see how much we can screw with Richard.  That's what we do on this show.  We're idiots.  You want a shot of Jaeger?  Oh, man.  A lot of people are uncomfortable out there.  I know.  You know what I did recently?  I went on...  Oh, here comes a joke.  All right.  Oh, Jesus Christ, Opie.  Oh, man.  You are friggin' brutal, man.  You are brutal.  Oh, dude.  I totally forgot about that.  Oh, wait a minute.  Here comes a joke. 
[02:03:00]  He was trying...  Oh, man.  He's just trying to tell his story.  They're like, you know...  He was trying to get into his material.  Oh, I got to hear this again.  I got to hear that part again, please.  I got to hear...  Let me hear it again.  Please, can we hear Anthony?  Actually, actually, I'm Anthony, and that's Opie over there.  He's really...  Dude, I got to hear that again.  He's just trying to...  I got to hear that again.  A lot of people are uncomfortable out there.  I know.  You know what I did recently?  I went on...  Oh, here comes a joke.  All right.  Oh, my God. 
[02:03:30]  This is just...  Oh, is that horrible?  Oh, what's wrong with you, man?  Oh.  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with you, dude?  What?  Oh, you should go to church.  People are getting really mad.  Listen, in the end, we were good with him.  I swear to God, don't make us play the boring XM call.  Boring.  Do you mean the one who you guys...  The boring call when we were just nice to him and having a conversation? 
[02:04:00]  He was probably funny and getting some laughs out on the...  He just died, dude.  Oh, man.  Oh, God.  All right.  Enough.  This is just bad.  Is that it?  Or does it get better?  It gets better?  A little bit better.  Oh, God.  I can't hear this.  Oh, man.  A lot of people are uncomfortable out there.  I know.  You know what I did recently?  I went on...  Oh, here comes a joke.  All right.  Forget it.  Oh, Pete.  That was a joke.  Come on, Richard.  Forget it.  Richard, let me explain something.  Look at two little babies. 
[02:04:30]  He's going to conform to our show.  Don't say...  We're not going to do the show.  He wants to be more funny.  Don't say two because Opie is...  Press button, you big loser.  Press button.  Be more funny.  Opie's the biggest prick.  Let's cut him off.  Let's cut him off.  He's starting to sound like he's going on us and we can't take it.  I was listening and Opie is a prick to guest.  You don't have a sense of humor?  There you go.  There you go.  Come on.  You don't have a sense of humor.  Be funny.  Be more funny.  Be more funny.  You don't think that was running through his head yesterday? 
[02:05:00]  Oh, God.  Dude, let's just say this.  What?  He's a very funny comic.  Absolutely.  Hilarious.  What's wrong with you?  I'm not...  Don't punch out on us.  I'm not punching out.  It's kind of nice to look back.  That's all.  It's just one of those nice moments we had on the show.  It's a little look back.  It's a little look back.  Yeah.  At our encounter with Richard Jr.  I remember you.  Sarah McLachlan playing.  Yeah.  That would be wonderful.  But he says something there that, yeah, is completely true. 
[02:05:30]  It's like, we want people to conform to our show.  Like, he was like, oh, you know, you want me to conform to your show?  I'm like, yeah, we're like, yeah.  Just hang out.  Just hang out and be funny.  Don't, like, go into, like, joke mode.  And we have to sit there and make believe we're not having...  Make him believe that we're actually having some kind of interaction.  I don't know if he was, like, setting up a joke there or just, oh, you know, the other  day I was going, oh, here comes a joke.  Oh, it's...  You cannot screw up a joke more than saying, here comes a joke. 
[02:06:00]  Especially when he came off as this natural conversational delivery that he was starting  up there.  Oh, everyone, here comes the joke.  Here it comes.  Let's all look at the monkey.  Hang on.  Here it comes.  That's exactly what it is.  It's like, all right, listen, if you want to get in here, you're going to be funny through  a window.  Then you get in here.  And then...  What's the problem, Bob?  And then he goes, he's a little pissed off because it's the second day of you either  hanging up on him or making him be funny through a window.  Yeah, two days in a row. 
[02:06:30]  And then you go, he goes, all right, I'm going to lay it down.  He's probably going to say some funny stuff that no one's going to know any better.  Yeah.  All right, here it comes.  Here comes a joke.  Here comes a joke, everybody.  Listen up.  Hold on to your hats because this is going to be good.  Here it goes.  Now go.  And go.  And you're on.  And now go.  What?  That would throw off your timing?  Give it up for Robert Kelly.  All right, here comes the joke.  Here it comes.  Are you ready to laugh? 
[02:07:00]  Oh, man.  Wow.  Wow.  That's just crazy.  All right, let's go to John in Detroit.  John, what's up?  Oh, geez.  Too soon, maybe?  Just brutal.  I'm dying over here.  You guys have got to stop.  Well, that was years ago, to be honest with you.  That was, uh...  Well, I know.  That had to be...  I didn't want to happen, but, I mean, just brutal.  It was before we got fired and got a new perspective on things.  That had to be five years ago.  And, you know, honestly, in the end, we had him call our XM show, and we had just a regular 
[02:07:30]  interview with Richard Jenney.  Everything was fine.  We didn't even mention the old days when we used to beat him up.  Taking it a little easy on the guy, though.  Well, just playing the way it happened, that's all.  I'm not going to hurt his feelings.  No, it's true.  All right, we got time for one more quickie.  You want to do a MILF license plate story, or you want to do the band booing?  Oh, yeah, the booing.  That's awful.  What is it?  Well...  Just more of the pussification of America. 
[02:08:00]  Ugh.  Just becoming a bunch of, like, faggots.  This, uh...  The nerds are taking over, man.  Yeah.  They've said that, you know, many, many, many, many years, but it's really happening.  The PC crap.  The PC crap.  Like, where did this begin?  Like, who started this?  Yeah, it just kind of snowballed from somewhere, but I don't know where it started.  There's a school, a high school in Washington.  They want to ban booing at sporting events. 
[02:08:30]  Booing.  You can't just taunt the other team.  That's what, like, home field advantage is all about.  That's what...  It's not just about sitting there and, yay, go team.  You got to kind of razz the opposing team.  Yeah, it's not like what we, Europe, where we're just, you know, screaming monkey and  doing monkey chants while they're playing soccer.  No, you're just...  You're booing a little bit.  They were banning face painting.  They were banning, uh...  Jesus.  The big foam ones, number one thing, which they should. 
[02:09:00]  This country stinks.  Other countries kill the referee if he makes a bad call.  Literally.  Like, kill him.  Kill him.  And hang him.  The hooligans.  Sucker hooligans.  Look, a lot of people know I'm a huge hockey fan, and the thing they started, I don't even  know how long ago, a couple years ago, if there's a controversial goal or play, and they're  playing for the home team, and it's against the home team, like, say, the other team did  something ridiculous, they'll show the clip up to the controversial part and stop it, because 
[02:09:30]  they don't want the crowd going nuts.  Going boo.  Why?  That used to be the fun of going to a sporting event, where you're like, oh my god, we all  just saw it, this guy's an ass.  Yeah.  They don't show the whole clip anymore at these games.  Why?  Why, I ask?  To make everything nice.  Everyone wants everything nice.  Or if there's a controversial goal, and they're going to the video replay, they'll show it almost  right up to the point, and then stop it. 
[02:10:00]  Like, what's the difference if you show the whole, you know, stadium, you know, the play  over again?  The referees are still going to make their judgment call.  Well, it just brought excitement to the game.  Yeah.  But they don't want to get everyone riled up.  Why?  That's the reason you go to these events.  That's part of the excitement, yeah.  This all started with gladiators at the Coliseum.  Oh.  The mentality's still there.  That's why we go to these things.  There was booing there.  Absolutely.  The good old days.  Well, this is what they want to do in one high school. 
[02:10:30]  The principal or the athletic director.  You just want to puke.  Parry them up to their necks.  That's it.  Well, listen to this, though.  Seriously.  In Washington State, high school sports fans are under the microscope.  And new guidelines list booing as unacceptable behavior that could get you kicked out.  What we're trying to do here is create positive behavior.  Create positive behavior at a sporting event.  Positive behavior is the ability to cheer or boo and sit there like a human being and have 
[02:11:00]  a good time.  I think they're lumping in, you know, punching each other in the face and bench-clearing brawls  that the crowd gets into.  Do you know what a boo is?  A boo is somebody expressing their anger without beating the crap out of somebody.  Yeah.  That's exactly.  You boo.  Instead of flipping out and savagely attacking the referee.  Yeah.  You go, boo.  Boo, you suck. 
[02:11:30]  And actually, it's a way of getting the angry emotion out.  Yeah.  Right there at the sports arena.  Instead of, you know, going home and being angry and keeping it in and then punching your  wife in the face and she goes, how was the game?  Boom.  Shut up, dear.  Create positive behavior.  We realize that there are going to be some negative things that come out of a game when  people don't like what happens.  But again, we're about civility and respect.  Schools monitor their fans with boo police, listening for jeers that cross the line. 
[02:12:00]  This is a joke, right?  Boo police.  We still live in this world, right?  This is what's going on around us?  There's a couple kids on the line.  We're not going to be able to get to them because we're running out of show here.  Come on, cheap trick.  The boo police.  This isn't an isolated high school.  There's two or three people on the line right now saying that this is already happening at  my school.  You're not allowed to boo at sporting events.  Oh, if we turned into a nation of fags.  The Chinese are coming, bro.  The Chinese are coming.  A nation of don't compete. 
[02:12:30]  Don't boo.  There's no losers.  Everyone's a winner.  Just a bunch of, we're not going to be able to compete as a nation.  You know what?  You can't be an astronaut if you want to, kids.  If you want, you can't be anything you want.  How's that sound?  No.  No, you can't.  Eventually, fast forward, the Olympics are going to be all about what?  Everyone gets a ribbon?  Everyone.  No, just be the retards.  It'll be the retards.  Just a bunch of retards with a bunch of blue ribbons and medals. 
[02:13:00]  The regular Olympics will be just like the Special Olympics.  We've got to get this clip in.  Some of the stations are going to dump out of us, unfortunately, and go into the next show.  But behavior other than booing is also banned.  Listen to this.  This crackdown on bad fan behavior goes way beyond booing.  Also listen to unacceptable behaviors, making disrespectful chants or yells, foot stomping,  or waving while an opponent shoots a free throw.  Some leagues have even banned full face paint.  And if you want to say your team is number one, you'll have to do it without the foam finger. 
[02:13:30]  Administrators defend the rules, insisting nasty fans are causing fights and spoiling games for everyone.  Critics say rules designed to keep players from feeling bad are misguided.  Now you're spoiling it for everybody.  Like if there's an unruly fan and you're like, all right, that guy's way over the top and out of control,  then you get him out of the game.  Throw him out.  Why does everyone else have to suffer?  You know what it's going to be?  You're going to be in an arena.  It's going to be all white.  We're all going to be dressed the same.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  Nobody's going to talk.  And you're just going to hear the ball bouncing on the ground.  Dunk, dunk, dunk, shunk.  Hey, listen, really fast.  You'll be able to blink real fast when you enjoy what you're seeing.  Right.  It's going to be all like golf.  The future.  We should have started this earlier because everyone is calling like crazy.  This is one of those hot topics.  You can definitely call the show tomorrow and we can continue with this story.

[02:15:30]  Bye.  Bye.  THE END 
[02:16:00]  THE END 
[02:16:30]  THE END 
[02:17:00]  THE END 
[02:17:30]  THE END 
[02:18:00]  THE END 
[02:18:30]  Oh yeah?  Every day people meet us outside the one studio and come on over here.  And she's here, an extremely white couple.  Just in their mannerisms, everything about them is like Wonder Bread, okay?  And they're from Houston and they're visiting New York. 
[02:19:00]  And she's having her baby shower because she has a lot of family up here in New York.  And then she looks at me with a straight face and I thought she was kidding.  She goes, we want to name our baby Grady.  And I think it's her mother thinks it's a black name.  What do you think?  That is probably the blackest name.  The blackest name because everyone knows Grady from Sanford and Son.  That's what I was telling her.  I don't think she even knows that that was a famous character on TV.  Grady?  Grady's like not only a black name, it's like old school black. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Do you know any Grady's?  No.  I know no Grady.  Grady O'Sullivan.  Maybe a little Irish.  Except for...  Oh, maybe a little Irish in there?  Great, great.  Yeah, so you ever hear, doesn't that sound like, I don't know, maybe I'm just...  O'Grady has the last name.  I'm sorry, O'Grady.  I'm not even going for a joke.  I'm trying to figure this out.  If that's a black name or a white name.  I just know from Sanford and Son, so I would have to say it's a black name big time.  They'll be up here in a few minutes and we'll talk to them, I guess. 
[02:20:00]  Grady.  Isn't that weird, though?  Out of every name you can pick, Grady?  It's just an awful name.  There are names out there.  Yeah, it's a horrible name.  White, black, whatever.  It's just an awful name.  Yeah.  There are a lot of horrible names out there.  From Houston, huh?  From Houston, yeah.  Going to have to talk to them.  How do they feel about the influx of...  It's like Esther.  Katrina victims.  I was going to say, the influx of Grady's.  Of Grady's.  Maybe that's it.  Maybe they want them to fit into the new Houston.  They came up with a new word right there.  That's a good one.  The influx of Grady's. 
[02:20:30]  I think Norton...  Well, Norton did text me from...  Where is he this weekend?  I think Pittsburgh?  Pittsburgh.  Was it Pittsburgh Improv.  And I just got to read it.  And I'm not even really sure what it means.  I think he's referring to the Richard Jennings stuff we just played.  He writes...  I'm trying to get him on the phone here.  He writes, what a couple of creeps.  I am mortified.  Oh.  So I guess he's listening to the show and heard the Richard Jennings stuff.  Yeah.  Someone called me too.  Really?  Yeah.  My friend from Boston. 
[02:21:00]  He's a comic.  Joe Yonetti.  He called me and was like, wow.  But he said that he...  You know, he actually said that they're trashing him in Boston because he...  I mean, I think he has a reputation for being a dick.  Really?  Well, he was saying that they...  He just wanted to be more famous than he was.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like a...  Well, he starred with Jim Carrey.  Doesn't everybody...  That was the beginning of the end.  That was like the role you do and then that role makes you the next Jim Carrey. 
[02:21:30]  That role put him right back into the clubs.  You know?  So, yeah.  That's the deal with you guys, you comedians.  You don't want to be doing comedy.  Well, you want to be doing it on the movie screen or on TV.  No.  You know, me and Patrice were talking about that last night.  It's like we...  Like guys like Patrice, me, Norton, we use comedy to kind of survive life.  You know?  So, we can't kill ourselves because we don't become famous.  You know?  We were douchebags anyways. 
[02:22:00]  We did...  You know, I use comedy to get out of juvie hall.  You know?  So, I didn't get killed or kill myself.  Yeah.  Patrice, the same thing.  Norton, the same thing.  Yeah, but...  But there's these guys like Richard Jennings who...  Who did comedy in life.  He was like, hey, how you doing?  What's going on?  In life, we're like, hey, what's up, dickhead?  And we...  You know, we're funny in life.  Right.  And then we bring it up on stage.  You know what I mean?  He's a comic.  But you use it as a stepping stone for bigger and greater things.  Well, you try to.  But I mean, if nothing happens, you're in the clubs, we're happy with that too. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, you're still...  Because you're around people that think the same.  Norton goes to fucking do...  I mean, Norton doesn't need to go to the cellar every single night of the week and do a spot.  But he does.  No, he's psychotic.  No, because you can't...  You can't not...  You know, some people can't not go up.  You know, Patrice will call you on the phone and pretty much do an hour on the phone with you...  Right.  ...of shit that he'll never do on stage, but it's just hilarious.  So...  Wow.  All right.  You're right.  A little fucking wordy. 
[02:23:00]  Wow.  I should have had a period in there.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  How about a couple, yeah, periods.  Wow.  He used honey puffs to tell me to shut the fuck up.  And I hate to play that clip if you shoot yourself in the face.  Actually, you just saved a lot of people from shooting themselves in the face.  Yeah.  Today, we remember Bob Kelly.  There was a bunch of guys with guns in their mouths and they snapped out of me when they  heard you pour you cereal.  Opie, you poured cereal in the middle of him talking.  Today, we remember Bob Kelly.  Here's his theory on comedians.  And it ends with... 
[02:23:30]  But see, that's why...  Back to my point.  All right.  That's why I won't kill myself because we know why we suck.  We're...  When I'm trying...  I'm not trying to be better than I know.  I'm a...  I know I'm a fucking idiot.  I know that I'm wordy.  I know that I fucking...  Dude, I know.  You know, the guys...  Certain guys, like, want to be superstars and they don't want to acknowledge the shit.  He wanted to be like, I think, that Jim Carrey level. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wish that cereal was crunchier.  So what you're saying, Bob, is what?  How can kashi faggot cereal be crunchier?  It is the gayest cereal ever.  That should just sound like a horse eating.  Why is that soft?  They recommend not to use milk, just pump loads of jizz on top of it.  Hey, hey, hey.  This show really does turn a corner over here. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, we certainly do.  Anthony comes alive.  It's just a...  Pump loads of jizz.  The whole thing about it, it really is about getting out of, like, the FM mindset and getting  over here.  It's a switch.  Oh, God.  It just turns...  It goes from, well, we can't quite say butt and then a few words and then plug.  You still know what you meant was butt plug.  And here it's like, shove that thing up your ass until shit is pouring off it like caramel.  Yeah, and then punch yourself in the cunt. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  It really is like a switch.  And we'd love to get right into it.  Yeah.  Dive right in.  Dive right in.  So, anyways.  Grady.  Yeah, people are...  Grady.  I actually know white guys named Grady.  I know a black guy named Patrice.  Yeah, that really isn't there.  That's a weird name.  Grady Little, former Red Sox manager.  All right, they're coming in here and there.  That's what I was thinking of.  You know, stupid... 
[02:25:30]  I just thought it was more of a black name.  I don't know.  We'll talk to them in a few minutes.  All right.  It's an awful name.  By the way, we were talking about...  Grady does suck.  I need the instant feedback because it's updating and someone made a...  It's like Esther.  You know how we're talking about booing and close plays that they don't show on the big  screen when you go to a sporting event, which drives me nuts because it's so exciting when  the whole crowd gets into it like, oh my God, it was a goal, and you just lose your mind,  you're waiting for the decision, and now they don't even do that because they don't want  everyone riled up.  Don't get the crowd riled. 
[02:26:00]  According to somebody, it's gone, but basically saying that it's the ref unions.  Are you shitting me?  Because they don't want to be yelled at or look like fucking bad guys.  The ref unions got this in place.  How did they allow that?  What was that?  The Islander game the other night?  With that fucking goal?  Chris Simon?  No, the goal.  The goal that was a fucking goal?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was a goal.  They probably don't want to be persuaded by you if they see it on a Trinitron and the 
[02:26:30]  players see it on the Trinitron.  But that's part of going to an event.  We might as well all just stay home and watch it on TV.  The excitement of going to the game is getting into it with the crowd.  Being able to yell, yeah.  You know, getting into those obnoxious chants about the opposing team, getting to boo, getting  to look like a complete asshole with the face paint and all that shit.  And that dumb high school wants to ban it.  And there's other high schools that already have banned all that stuff.  That's so stupid.  We might as well just stay at home.  Yeah, watch it on TV.  The Chris Simon play, which was just a brutal, brutal hit, the Ranger-Irlander game that a 
[02:27:00]  lot of people talked about.  I think he got 25 games suspension.  I didn't get to go to that game and I got season tickets, but it's coming in like crazy  because we started talking about this.  They didn't show the hit again.  Really?  On the big screen.  It happened and then they obviously stopped the game and it was the whole game basically.  And you don't show that moment on the screen.  Why go to the live game?  You should show the good ones, the bad ones.  Because it's part of being at a live sporting event. 
[02:27:30]  And like you said, they're laughing at us all over the country because they kill the  refs.  They kill each other.  Who cares if we're booing in the stands?  You know what happens at these soccer games over in Europe?  With the hooligans.  Soccer hooligan.  They got to bring out like dogs and horses and like, you know, firearms to calm down the  grass.  They burn the bleachers down.  They're websites that both sides go to before the match because they secretly schedule a  fight.  Yeah.  And they both agree, okay, we meet here before the game. 
[02:28:00]  We beat the shit out of each other.  Then we go watch the game and then we'll beat the shit out of each other again.  And then we'll set the stands on fire and we'll riot.  It'll be great.  Yeah.  So, let's go to Rob and Hofstra.  Rob, what's up?  Hey there, Rob.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  They don't do it.  The referees union didn't ban showing the replays.  It's when a play goes in favor of the home team and they don't want you to see it again, 
[02:28:30]  they don't show it because they don't want the referees to see it to overturn it.  If there's like a challenge at a football game or whatever.  But if the play goes against the home team, then they'll replay it over and over again  to fire the crowd up.  Yeah, but the ref shouldn't be influenced by any reaction at a sporting event.  Well, I mean, yeah.  That's their whole job is to be impartial.  Who gives a shit if everyone's cheering because they see the play replayed on the screen and  it looks like a goal to them?  Agreed.  But I think the premise is that they don't want the home team, they don't want to show 
[02:29:00]  it so that the referees don't see it on the screen to overturn it rather than pumping  the fans up.  Tell the refs not to look.  The refs aren't allowed to look at the fucking screen.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  By the way, I apologize for eating, but I almost passed out the way over today.  Nice.  Yeah.  So, I got to get food in me.  I'm not kidding.  I was getting like...  I'm just laughing at his jizz comment about your gay cereal. 
[02:29:30]  It might have been the Houston couple talking about Grady and the baby cereal.  I'm like, oh, my God.  I mean, a lighthead.  Oh, my God.  There they are.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you walked over.  Oh, my God.  In this weather, I can't be bothered.  And I'm walking to...  I leave immediately.  I'm walking with them acting like I gave a shit.  Oh, it's the worst.  They were so excited.  They're, oh, we're coming up.  They probably just called a million people and now they're listening and he's like,  I gave a shit about them.  And then they're like, where did you stomp on the cake? 
[02:30:00]  I'm like, over there.  And they're like, you know, I felt really bad that day.  And now I'm getting speeches.  I just want to get to the other studio.  Yeah, they're on the phone.  I had a great conversation with Corbin Bernson backstage.  Corbin Bernson.  That was a great one, fucking George.  And then he's just ragging him from the stage.  This idiot backstage.  That's what you just did with him.  Yeah, he did.  They're right there.  They're probably like, that was cool.  We walked with Opie. 
[02:30:30]  Had a great conversation.  He's not such a dick.  Oh, he wasn't.  No, it was a real talk about things like life and stuff.  And you're there.  These two dicks.  I had almost made me pass out.  I needed faggot cereal to revive myself.  I needed jizz puffs.  Do you think at this point I care that you were bothered by me jumping on a cake?  Shut up.  Go home and name your baby Grady and leave me alone.  Throwing their hands up in the air. 
[02:31:00]  What do we do?  What do we do?  Get him a mic.  Hey, Redding from Whackbag.  Opie, they didn't show that play at the Islander game because they didn't want to incite a riot.  Horrific things have happened in the past and they've showed it on the big screen and there wasn't a riot.  And that's kind of part of the fun, too, going to a Ranger Islander game.  A little riot.  It's everywhere.  The people fighting can handle it for the most part.  Yeah.  The players fight.  Yeah.  It's part of the game.  Yeah, that's what sucks about hockey.  You don't get to see.  I remember I saw this clip of, I don't know what it was, a hockey player walked up in front of the other team, 
[02:31:30]  threw his gloves off, and then called the whole team out of the bench.  It was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.  I watched it like 90 times.  No, but the whole team, no.  The team were like, fuck that.  This guy could beat the shit out of everybody.  That's great.  Yeah.  They really have pussified sports in general.  Yeah.  Like hockey, if you leave the bench now when your teammates fighting, your automatic game suspension,  or even more than that now.  Old days, man.  Your boy was in a fight on the ice. 
[02:32:00]  Everyone got involved.  Even the two goalies would fight and they had nothing to do with the actual play.  Opposite end of the ice.  The fight's over by the time they reach each other in the middle.  Even when they fought, though, nothing could happen because they had so much pads on the padding.  Dude, yeah, let them fight.  It's like fighting a mattress.  Hockey fights look great, but there's nothing really going on as far as damaging the other player for the most part.  You get a few stitches here and there.  I like when they pull them away and one guy pull the shirt over his head and do the uppercut.  But you can't get a... 
[02:32:30]  You've got to be on solid ground to get the weight behind a punch.  You're like sliding and hitting.  Yeah, the second you release a punch, the force going forward is pushing you backwards because you're on ice.  So you're really hitting...  It's like an underwater fight, Opie, which you have experience with.  I agree.  Why, you fought somebody on the...  Of course he did.  Who?  A Frenchman.  A Frenchman.  What?  Some frog.  Come on.  You don't know that story?  No, please tell me you...  I've told it too many times.  Diving.  The guy annoyed me.  Diving.  Out in the Caribbean.  And it was a diving boat. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, shit.  All right.  Some French guy.  Fucking fighting guy on the water.  I'd be so nervous.  It's like sea hunt.  I'm scared.  Did you have like a little knife in your sock?  No.  Cut his airline.  Yeah.  Pink.  Blue, sacre bleu.  He has got me.  I grab a little weight and cut the line and shoot to the surface like Bond.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  I was diving and it was an hour boat ride to get out there.  I was, and still am for the most part, a newbie as far as diving goes. 
[02:33:30]  And they're giving instructions on the boat and that's when you're supposed to pay attention.  And the Frenchman, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub, blub.  Not paying attention to anybody.  Just thinking, you know, his shit don't stink.  Louder than everyone likes.  Because he's French.  Stupid Americans.  All that.  Like the stereotypical Frenchman.  Yeah.  And, you know, they're basically telling you like when you descend, you got to do it very slowly.  Because, first of all, you can pop your freaking brain, basically.  Right.  And it's not good for the people below you. 
[02:34:00]  That's where the problem is.  So we all jump in, and I go to the bottom, nice, nice.  And I'm just, like, waiting at the bottom, nice, like a foot off the ground.  And I look up, and here comes the Frenchman that wasn't listening on the boat.  Like a fireman coming down the pole.  I'm like, this mother is going to hit me.  He lands on top of me.  So I push him hard.  He pushes me, and I'm like, all right, now it's on.  And I punch him in the face.  This is underwater.  You punched him in the face underwater? 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  How fast did it go?  Like a half mile an hour.  You can't punch people in the face.  And when you hit him in the face, what happened?  Obviously nothing.  I'm not sitting here like I'm Mr. Tough Guy.  You can't hurt someone underwater.  It's just the fact that I decided to punch him underwater.  I couldn't get it.  Punches him underwater?  Why don't you just give him the finger and say, hey, well, up top, we'll finish this.  Frenchy.  And I couldn't get, you know, you have to be on solid ground.  So as I'm punching, my whole body's going side-back. 
[02:35:00]  Can you just keep going like you're in space?  Exactly.  I did like a little twirly twirl after I punched him.  And then we started wrestling.  And then the instructor comes down.  What the fuck?  It's like an old-time fucking episode of Sea Hunt.  He's got a knife clenched in his teeth.  He's got one of those, one of the, the, the, the, the, uh, spear gun, spear gun, hit him  with a spear gun.  So then he's got a box of Kashi.  So then the instructor comes down, because, you know, it's supervised, and he sees that 
[02:35:30]  we're tangled up, and he thinks we're just having problems with our equipment, and he  kind of separates us.  And then we both swim off, and I'm elbowing him the whole time.  Because we're all in a little crawl underwater.  True story.  Nice.  I couldn't, you need solid ground to get a good punch.  You certainly do.  Let's say hi to, uh, Jared Cotter.  Jared.  Hey, what's up?  Uh, Jared got kicked off American Idol last week. 
[02:36:00]  Jared?  Uh, do we have to say kicked off?  Like, can we say, like, released or something?  Uh, voted off some way where it doesn't sound like you actually got a boot.  Well, it's complete bullshit.  I think, um, I think, uh, Paul has, you know, stuck up for you.  You obviously shouldn't have got voted off Sanjay, or whatever his name is, should  have got kicked off.  Cutie patootie.  Uh, we have Bob Kelly in the studio.  He's a comedian, and he, uh, he thinks Sanjay is, is cute.  Let me tell you, Jared. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah?  Is he as good looking in person as we see on TV?  Come on, tell me about her.  Tell me all about her.  Oh, man.  So I've been told, man.  So I've been told.  Does he wear bikini underwear?  Just let me know that.  No, no, he doesn't wear bikini.  He may, I don't know.  How mad were you when he got on to stay and you didn't?  Um, I was just mad that I wasn't there.  I mean, he could have been there as long as I was there.  Did you want to, did you want to hate fuck him after that?  Jeez.  I'm kidding.  All right, let's, let's, let's, let's, hold on. 
[02:37:00]  I was going to be a publicist on the floor.  I was going to yank him off.  That was me.  I apologize.  Yeah, that was Bob Kelly.  That was what I want to do.  I apologize.  We're finally in good again with the American Idol people, so we want to try to, like, you know.  He was actually a great singer, by the way.  Yeah, Jared, you were great.  He was, he was really good.  And you played some, you played some hoops, huh?  Yeah, man.  I played, uh, Division II, um, basketball at Five Towns College on Long Island.  Five Towns, yeah.  Oh, Five Towns.  Okay.  Yeah, they, they, they used to have a basketball team there, believe it or not.  And, uh, we were really good.  We went to the Final Four in the, in the, uh, Division II NCAA. 
[02:37:30]  So, it was really, it was really a great situation.  I gotta ask you, when you get to the point where, uh, you were there in American Idol and you know,  you, you know you're sounding good.  Uh, do you start thinking ahead or do you try to not do that?  Like, do you start thinking like, oh my God, if I win this, there's gonna be this, this, this.  And it just makes, uh, getting released, as you say, that much more disappointing?  Man, I, yeah.  That's exactly how it is.  Yeah.  That's exactly how it is.  I, you know, honestly, I never thought, one, the competition, I think, there's a lot of dope singers, um, that are, that are left. 
[02:38:00]  Um, but I really knew, knew in my heart that I was gonna make that Top Ten.  And, uh, unfortunately, it just didn't go down that way.  Because, you know, Top Ten goes on tour.  Right.  And I feel like I, I, I really could, could have, could have gotten there.  But luckily, I did get far enough to where, uh, people were still giving me opportunities other than, you know, um, you know, those from American Idol.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh, you know, I get.  Go ahead, sorry.  No, go ahead, Jared.  I'm sorry.  I didn't interrupt. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, no, it's cool.  I get recognized in the street, you know, it was funny, last night I was, I was, I'm still in L.A., um, and last night I was, uh, I have a dinner with some friends and Babyface was in the audience, I mean, in the, uh, restaurant.  And he actually came up to me after he was done and was like, listen, man, you shouldn't have gotten voted off.  You're a great talent.  And, you know, just for somebody of that caliber to come up to me and give me those type of props was like, you know, it's worth it, man.  Yeah.  And I'm really, I'm really excited to, to see where it takes me.  And then, and, uh, and then what happened after that? 
[02:39:00]  Uh, with Babyface?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, you know, we just, we talked for a quick second and, uh, you know, he, he seemed like he had other things to do.  But, uh, you know, I have his contact information and hopefully, uh, we'll do some stuff.  Yeah.  But after you left the restaurant, nothing else happened, I guess?  With Babyface?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  So who do you think is going to win American Idol?  I really don't know, man.  I, you know, if, if, if you would have asked me that question last week, I may have had an answer for you. 
[02:39:30]  But after the people that got, you know, voted off this week, I, I, you know, I really feel like anything could happen.  Sabrina Sloan is a great singer.  Uh, Sundance is an incredible singer.  And, you know, and I just, I can't believe it.  What do you think about the Antonella, uh, uh, controversy?  Antonella is, is a great girl, for real.  Um, I think that a lot, you know, the way she's portrayed because of the, the photos is, is a shame. 
[02:40:00]  But she's a really great girl.  And, uh.  She's, she's just like a, pretty much a regular girl.  She really is.  In that age bracket.  I mean, you guys obviously all knew behind the scenes, man, because they, they didn't talk about that at all on the actual show.  But you guys had to be kind of Googling and, uh, checking out the, the pictures when you were back in the hotel room.  Well, she actually.  I mean, you're mad after all there, Jared.  Come on.  No doubt.  Yeah, but she, she, uh, she, when, when the, when the pictures came out, she found out and she ran from my room. 
[02:40:30]  Like, we're, we're pretty close.  And, uh, and, you know, she, she actually showed me and I was like, uh, should I be looking?  Wait, she showed you?  Oh, God.  Yeah, she's like, look at, look at this crap that's on the internet.  And I was like, I don't know if it's crap.  But, uh.  Wait, Jared.  Yeah, no, she was in your room.  Go back.  Step back.  Yeah, Jared, you know what that was all about.  Who are you kidding?  That was, that was a move.  She was making a move.  Because, uh, when you got kicked off last week, I noticed she was crying, uh, harder than anyone in the audience there. 
[02:41:00]  Or, uh, you know, as far as the, uh, contestants go.  Right.  I mean, we're, we're really good friends, man.  And, you know, that, that's about it.  That's about it.  Like, I, I don't look at her like that anymore.  She, uh.  Anymore?  I mean, she's a pretty girl.  You can't, you can't help but notice that.  Right.  But, uh, you know, we, we're just friends.  I, I wouldn't, you know, conform to, to what everybody else was.  Everybody was telling her how pretty she was.  And I'd be like, you know, you're, you're just ugly.  You know?  That's just the, I just don't look at her like that, man. 
[02:41:30]  For real.  Yeah.  So, uh, who's calling you?  Any opportunities yet?  Yeah.  A lot of people.  I, you know, I can't say anything, but, like, now.  But, uh, but yeah, I'm, I got a lot of opportunities on, on my plate, man.  I'm really excited to go through them and, uh, see which ones are best for me, for real.  Are you going back to waiting tables?  Hell no.  Good for you.  I'll never have to do that again.  Are you excited?  Yeah.  That's, that's what's great about it.  You know, and, you know, in general, like, I never have to do that again in my life. 
[02:42:00]  You have to go back and, and go to that restaurant and order just a meal and have all the, your,  your buddies that you worked with wait on you.  That's what you should do.  I think, I think I'm definitely going to do that.  And then complain to the manager.  Yeah.  The guy that fired me for, for trying out for American Idol.  What did he do in, uh, as far as music goes, like in New York, just hanging around before  American Idol?  Were you in bands or, uh, what'd you do?  Yeah, I was, you know, I was recording all the time, you know, writing with, with every  and anybody I could. 
[02:42:30]  Um, I was all over the place, performing at BB Kings, SOBs, The Village Underground.  You know, I've, I was there the whole time doing my thing.  And American Idol was honestly just another audition for me.  Um, and it just worked out.  The, the, the one audition worked out.  You know, I made it to the top, you know, 15.  Yeah.  Well, when you think, you know, even though you didn't make it like, uh, uh, to the top  10, uh, you gotta, you gotta look at all the people that audition and then just that you're 
[02:43:00]  making it as far as you did is still pretty cool.  Uh, it's definitely, you know, it blows it, you know, you're not top 10.  Paula had, Paula had the hots for him too.  Oh yeah, you could tell.  She was getting a little moist there, John.  Oh, she liked you, dude.  She just commented on how she was looking.  Is she just, is she just like kind of wandering the hallways every night, just banging on doors?  That's what I picture.  Paula Abdul's just.  Jared, Jared, are you there?  Jared, I'm just making sure you're all right.  Jared.  She couldn't, she couldn't control herself when you were up there.  Jared, I need to show you some pictures of me on the internet. 
[02:43:30]  Jared.  Oh, oh, oh.  We just having fun.  Jared.  Oh my God, how horny is Paula Abdul?  Let's just get right into this.  And Jared, if you deny it, you're lying.  Did you ever think about it?  Deny it, just deny it so I can call you a liar.  Yeah, just as a, just as a goof.  You know she's not going to tell anyone.  No.  No, I, I, I can't even, I can't even begin to comment on that one.  Yeah.  So you kissed her. 
[02:44:00]  I bet.  So you kissed her.  You kissed her.  She, she, she gave you a kiss on the cheek, but then when you turned in for the cheek,  she turned it on the mouth and then she stuck her tongue in your mouth like a lizard.  Bob has a great, uh, fantasy in his head.  I love it.  I love it like that.  Yeah.  She really loved you, dude.  She commented on you every week.  She was really bummed out.  America's just stupid how they're voting for these people.  It's ridiculous.  Like, like the judges said, it's a singing competition, you know?  Like Antonella, I mean, I know you guys are close, but she should have been kicked off a  week or two ago. 
[02:44:30]  Sanjay should have been kicked off last week instead of yourself.  And you know, well, the reason why, and, and, and, and is because the, uh, uh, there's  a billion, there's a billion Indian people that are going to keep him on.  Like, seriously, like what's his name?  The basketball player, uh, the Chinese guy, what's his name?  Uh, Yao Ming is voted, uh, into the all-star number one every year.  Every year.  Right.  Because there's a billion Chinese people going, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, Yao Ming, Yao Ming.  And then he gets voted in.  It has nothing to do with his, uh, ability?  No, and that's why my cutie pie is getting voted in, because there's a million, a million 
[02:45:00]  Indian people.  By the way, Jared, uh, not that we know, uh, Bob Kelly's not gay, but, uh, just, there's  something about Sanjay.  There's something about him.  Yeah, he likes it.  He's calling him his cutie pie, huh?  Well, Patrice, uh, a very funny comic, he came in Friday and he was really mad and he  goes, God, they just got to kick that kid off so the healing could, could begin.  Yeah, he's having a hard time with his own, like, sexuality, just watching him and kind  of being, not, not so much turned on, but he actually wants to just go out on a date 
[02:45:30]  with him and hold hands and nothing, you know, nothing really filthy or anything.  He just wants to be with him at, at, like a girl.  You would just take around and show your friends.  I'll have his number if you, if you're, if you want to hook up.  Yes, I do.  I want to, I'm going to, I, I, I, listen to me.  Don't, don't mess around.  Don't toy with me like this.  He's teasing.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm serious.  It's his voice, that little, hey, hey.  Oh, God.  Well, it might have been the hula dance. 
[02:46:00]  The hula dance was amazing.  The hula dance.  Come on, Jared.  What were you thinking when you saw that on the screen?  Yeah, come on, Jared.  Out of everything.  You're thinking how talented a hula dancer he was.  Because the question was, well, it was like a get to know the idols.  What happened?  Yeah.  Oh.  I don't know, man.  Uh, no, but it was, it was pretty much, you know, tell us something about yourself.  And, and there's Jared, like, you know, telling them that he's good at hoops and they show  him dunking the balls and very, you know, something that. 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  One guy was football.  Yeah, he does.  Yeah.  Another guy was football.  And then they show, uh, Sanjay or whatever.  And there he's hula dancing.  He goes like this.  Not many people know this.  No shit.  But I, but I, hula.  I wanted to learn the customs.  I thought when he said not many people know this, I thought he was going to say, I'm an  ultimate fighter.  No, I'm a, no, not many people know this, but I'm a sloppy bottom.  No, listen, listen.  Oh.  You know, Bobby, you're always taking it one step. 
[02:47:00]  I'm sorry.  This is Bobby.  We want to, like, be able to interview some of the American Idol people, so.  Well, this is, I think that, uh.  It might be a wrap for you guys after Bobby, man.  Yeah, really.  I'm on.  I'm tapping off.  You don't even want to know what happened with us and Taylor Hicks.  Jay Moore screwed it up for us with Taylor Hicks.  It was really bad.  It took a lot of flowers and candy to get back in there, good graces.  And hulas.  So we want to try to keep this going for a week or two.  You don't need to interview that guy anyway, so that's cool.  Nah.  Yeah, he's a, he's a complete bomb.  He's on the outs.  Really?  Yeah.  Taylor Hicks is, uh, they're basically saying the first bomb. 
[02:47:30]  Yep.  Yeah.  Yeah, basically.  I mean, I woke up, I woke up to Chris Daughtry this morning.  I turned on the TV.  There he is.  His video just rocking.  And that thing is selling like crazy as album.  Like hotcakes.  I was going to say that.  The thing with that is like, you know, he didn't win.  And, you know, I'm looking at that, at him and Jennifer Hudson as kind of, you know, people  to look up to about this whole thing.  It's an inspiration of the people that got, uh, the boot.  Right.  That got kicked off. 
[02:48:00]  Basically.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you think a chick wins American Idol this year?  I don't know, man.  I, you know, I think it's anybody's game at this point.  Um, there are still some guys that are getting a lot of votes.  Yeah.  You know, more, more votes than some of the better singing girls.  So, uh, I, I really don't know.  I'm just really, you know, I'm excited for them.  I wish I was there.  Are you, uh, are you going to date Antonella after the show or?  No, no, no.  But I'll definitely bring her by if you want me to. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  That'd be cool.  Hey, Jared.  Oh, yeah.  Do they tell you not to flip out if you get kicked off?  Do they prep you?  Like, look, don't punch anybody.  Don't say, don't say fuck.  Don't say that's bullshit.  That little homo should be off.  Oh, my God.  Do they prep you?  This, uh, good sportsmanship is boring.  Yeah, we want one.  Although, uh, that one girl that got kicked off, I know you have to go.  All right.  Uh, a couple weeks ago, the girl that got kicked off, she couldn't even sing the song at the end.  She was just losing it. 
[02:49:00]  He laughed so hard.  Jared almost lost it.  You could tell.  He was like, uh.  He held it together.  Oh, he said, so what'd you say?  No, I was, I was pissed off.  Yeah, he was pissed off.  Yeah, you could tell.  Simon definitely caught, almost caught the ABM.  Do you guys know what ABM is?  No.  No.  Angry Black Man.  Oh, yeah.  No.  He definitely almost caught it.  Now, that would have been good.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right, listen, they're telling us you gotta go, for real.  Oh, lady, you caught that the other day.  I wish I could talk to you guys longer.  Well, come on by.  You're a New York guy, right? 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, you're a New York guy.  I'm a New York guy.  I would love to come by.  Come on by and hang with us someday.  You seem pretty cool, Jared.  Yeah, I'm down, man.  I'll be there.  All right, Jared Cotter, everyone.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Thank you, man.  Look for me on the internet.  I'm all over there, and I'm sure you'll see me again soon.  All right, cool.  Jared Cotter.  All right.  Remember that name.  For what?  I don't know.  Oh, God.  Angry.  What is it?  An MB what?  What?  What was it?  An A?  Angry Black.  Angry Black.  A-B-M.  A-B-M.  A-B-M.  Yeah. 
[02:50:00]  Two old ladies got a couple of those.  Yeah, they got a couple of A-B-M's.  Them and their fucking Walker.  Exactly.  Just plug her in the fucking face.  I thought, but she's, if white people could make a black guy in a basement, this would  be him.  He did tell us he said that.  Yeah.  Oh, why didn't we say that while he was on the phone?  Oh, well, he is a really, he's just a perfect, look at that.  Yeah.  He's wearing the sweater over the shirt kind of thing.  Hey, how you doing?  Got a nice smile.  Yeah, well-spoken.  The upper lip isn't the same size as the bottom lip. 
[02:50:30]  The color's just right.  Yeah.  Got just enough white features in there to feel safe.  Did he have a black man backstage ready to come out?  I don't know.  He looked like he had a, I mean, this kid really did look like he.  Yeah.  Yeah, when Simon said something to him and he went, hmm.  You've seen that little, like, and I was like, come on, let it out.  Say it.  Like when O.J., remember O.J. before the murders, he was just the smiling, happy O.J.?  Right.  And then you saw that clip of him standing by the tree talking to the cop, and he was  like all mean, like angry O.J.  And you're like, who is that?  That's not O.J., is it? 
[02:51:00]  And you realize what a nut animal he was.  Someone's going to snap on this show.  Someone's going to call it out.  That would be good.  I'm just thinking of what you were saying.  Just somebody goes, and I'm sorry you won't be continuing.  Are you, are you?  You're shitting me, right?  Yeah.  You fucking faggot.  Beep, beep, beep, beep.  You're shitting me.  Because if that fuck is going on and I have to fucking go home, you could shit in your fucking  hat.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  Boop.  Then they just go to that fucking Indian, Indian screensaver. 
[02:51:30]  Fucking color bars.  We're sorry.  American Idol will not be seen in this time slot.  Someone is calling me a pussy because we didn't go with the, and then what happened  bit.  It just didn't feel like it was going anywhere.  It still has to go somewhere, believe it or not.  Yeah.  In our minds.  All right, Kenji, or whatever your name is from Albany, I acknowledge that.  You're calling me a pussy today, all right?  There you go.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  There's a very special show. 
[02:52:00]  It's about being able to do the show we want to do.  Prison sex.  Give it to me.  We know what guys want to hear on the radio.  Adult-oriented subject matter.  Look at those chunks.  You opie, puto, cine, megalo, cheomorfo.  They will exercise restraint.  This is giving me an awful show.  Hold on tight, kids.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show is bringing back the walkover.  March 16th, the day before St. Patrick's Day.  Join O.P., Anthony, Jimmy, and the O.N.A. Show crew as they walk from CBS to XM. 
[02:52:30]  To me, wait.  Spring is just around the corner, so what better way to celebrate than walking a block with a bunch of radio dopes.  That's Friday, March 16th.  Join the walkover from CBS to XM with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We got a little Jimmy Norton on the line.  Jimmy! 
[02:53:00]  Hello?  Hi.  I got a text from you.  You were mortified?  Oh, my God, dude.  It was...  I knew it was coming up.  I was like, not the jail interview.  Not today.  It was really sad.  Yeah.  Talking about the Richard Jenny audio we played earlier today.  Yeah, it was very funny.  You had to do it.  But you remember, we actually had a normal interview with the guy after we got back on radio here at XM.  Oh, I know.  And I remember the other one, the 9-11 one, which got uncomfortable. 
[02:53:30]  And he was like, yeah, but you guys can use bells and whistles and buttons.  And you said, yeah, but you can say the same thing every night.  We can.  And he went, that is true.  That is true.  Oh, do we have that?  I don't know.  But it was really funny.  Yeah, E-Rock's got to find that because we really weren't getting along.  And for some reason, he just kept on calling and trying to get a relationship going with us.  And do you have the 9-11 comedy tape?  He's yelling something, E-Rock.  E-Rock's got to find it.  That was a really deconstructing, horrifying day, I remember. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, God, yeah.  Yeah.  And in hindsight, it's just awful.  Well, at the time, he deserved it.  Like I said, we made good in the end, but, you know.  So, any insight on that whole thing, Jimmy?  No.  I mean, I got a call from Rogan on Friday about it, and I think Bobby had called him.  So, I mean, stupid Bob Kelly knows as much as the rest of us do.  I don't like the language, though.  I don't like the language as far as his girlfriend said he shot himself in the face. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  That sounds kind of fishy, man.  Like, why do you, unless you're just mad at yourself because you feel like you look old,  why else would you shoot yourself in the face in the shower?  That's just a weird thing to do.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Well.  To answer your question, no, I have no insight at all.  So, you think, I'm thinking, Jimmy's thinking some kind of fucking CSI shit that maybe it's  a little fishy?  I don't know.  Unless her wording was just panic-stricken. 
[02:55:00]  She's like, my boyfriend shot himself in the face.  And it was like, I don't know.  Just to me, first of all, me and Kenny were discussing this.  Why do you shoot yourself where your girlfriend's going to find you?  I mean, you know she's going to find you.  She's making you breakfast.  I don't know.  I'm not saying she shot him, but it just seems a little weird.  I'd be interested to see what happens in the next few days.  Interesting.  So, you don't think, oh, all right.  So, you think there might be something else to this?  I don't know.  I mean, this guy was making tremendous amounts of money, which is not the end-all, be-all. 
[02:55:30]  But when you're making, you know, 20 or 30 grand a night, you know, you're one of the  more respected acts in the business.  Unless he was just depressed.  I mean, I talked to him about six months ago, and I didn't know him well at all.  I just knew him casually.  He had called me about something else.  He was very, he was kind of really depressed and a little drunk in all the afternoon.  Yeah, people say that he was bummed out that he wasn't bigger than he was.  You know what I mean?  I mean, even though he's making $20,000, $30,000 a show, there's people out there doing arenas.  There's people out there making $300,000 a show, making movies.  Say it.  Say it.  There's Dane. 
[02:56:00]  Just say it.  Well, there's Dane.  That's exactly.  Dane throws him, pursue it himself.  Well, there's a bunch of guys out there.  I mean, even Mancia's doing the arenas.  Lisa Lampanelli's, for Christ's sake, he's doing theater tours.  And, you know, this guy's probably like, shit, I thought I was, after the mask, I was going  to be the next guy making movies, and he never really panned out.  And there's rumors that he had some kind of medical condition,  that he was frustrated with.  That's what I read, too.  I'm almost hoping it was that.  It's like, because I feel really bad about this one.  And it's not that I knew him well, but it's almost sad to me that such a great comic did 
[02:56:30]  that.  Like, what the fuck does...  Like, if you're that funny, and you're that professional a stand-up comic, and you're still  blowing your brains out before you're 50, I mean, that's fucking depressing for the  rest of it.  That's a sad state of affair.  You're making $20,000 a night.  You're that good.  You're that respected.  You've done such great specials, and it's still not enough.  I mean, what is there?  So I'm hoping, almost, it was something awful medical, because that will explain it.  Like, you can go, oh, okay, that's why he did that.  Not that it makes it any better for his family, but... 
[02:57:00]  Yeah.  You know.  I mean, again, I didn't know the guy well.  I'm more sad, because I think a really good comic did something so awful.  I mean, I didn't know the guy that well.  Let's get to something even a little more depressing than this.  How's Pittsburgh?  Oh, Pittsburgh was awful.  I mean, it's funny.  Me and Kenny were talking about Richard Jennings Friday afternoon while we were eating lunch.  We were talking about him, and then we found out later that day.  I was just happy we weren't talking about him when it actually happened.  That would have been too fucking creepy.  And then Kenny, and of course, Kenny's like, well, maybe he was gay. 
[02:57:30]  I was, where did you get that from?  Why would you do that?  What the fuck does he get?  Kenny's the, you know...  Well, you know, I don't want to be the bear of bad news.  Yeah, he slept outside your hotel room door, so he could be the first to tell you.  I'm surprised he wasn't driving to the Jenny family house to give them the news first.  Oh, you already know.  You already know.  Well, maybe some details.  I might be a faggot.  The local police department, look, could you keep her under your hat until I get there?  I'd like to tell the next of kin. 
[02:58:00]  Pittsburgh was great, dude.  I mean, the shows were mobbed, most of them.  The fan base there is really good, man.  I mean, just really, really...  I did more shows than I normally do, and two out of the three were sold out Saturday.  The late show had over 200 on it.  I mean, it was really loud.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know what the ratings are in Pittsburgh, but I mean, whatever it is,  the fans are showing up in droves every time.  It's getting more and more.  Jimmy's our reconnaissance, man.  Yeah, it's nice to say that.  I just said in droves, too. 
[02:58:30]  I'm fucking talking about my shows the way my mom would talk about them.  In droves for my son.  They came to see him in droves.  I really am just contributing nothing.  I'm going to go on the message board and just trash myself at somebody else.  Tomorrow we announce the first date of the ONA traveling virus comedy tour.  Yeah.  Tomorrow we announce all the details for the first one that's going to happen.  It's a secret, though.  Yeah, it's a secret.  It's going to happen somewhere that's warm, because it's going to be in April, the first date. 
[02:59:00]  Bob Kelly is part of it.  Joe Rogan's part of it.  And then, of course, a little Jimmy Norton.  Yep.  All the details tomorrow.  I know.  And you know, I'm so tired right now that, as you said that, I almost blurted it out accidentally.  I'm really glad I didn't.  That's why I said it's a secret.  I heard you're gearing up to just blurt out the location.  Can I correct Bob Kelly on something?  As we were driving in, I heard Bob.  What's up, Jim?  I made a point about how Jenny probably wanted to be bigger than he was.  I mean, that's probably a common thing for us.  But I don't like the fact that you included yourself in, like, the humble man. 
[02:59:30]  Like, dude, I know where I am.  You don't know where you are.  You just bought an apartment.  You really think that you're a fucking gentleman about town.  You have no idea how hard it is.  Bob, I just wish you lived in a higher flow when you kill yourself.  You'll fucking get it done.  Bob, ten floors is high enough, Bob.  What do you think I'm going to jump ten floors and bounce?  With your body, you might bounce.  You're like silly putty.  Bob makes everyone uncomfortable.  Well, he has to announce to us.  This didn't make the radio yet. 
[03:00:00]  It will now.  He's like, I just bought a place across the street from a gay bar.  Did you really, Bob?  No, I didn't know.  Or a gay club or something.  I didn't know it was a gay bar.  And what was outside again?  I walked by it like 20 times.  It's a poster of a man sitting indie style with no top on and licking his lips.  And I didn't know it was a gay bar.  What do you think it was?  I don't know.  Just a guy enjoying a drink.  Huh?  You were stepping on Jimmy's probably brilliant line.  I just want to let you know. 
[03:00:30]  It was just shit.  This is the fucking gem I was going to fire out with my nose strip peeling off.  What did you think it was?  A store that just sold assless chaps?  Because of all the people walking in and out of it?  You like how Bob said he's walked by it 20 times?  Yeah, just by it.  Not in the front door.  Are you going to get my fingerprints on that doorknob?  You walk in like, hey, I just want to get to know my neighbors.  That's all.  I pulled my hoodie sleeve down over my hand when I opened the door. 
[03:01:00]  My joke just bombs, so I'm going to try it again.  I'm praying it's just because no one heard it.  But Bob keeps saying he walked by.  He meant as B-I.  See, I didn't hear that.  Oh, thank God.  I thought everyone heard it and politely ignored it because it's a bad day.  Knocks on his neighbor's door for a cup of jizz.  Because I'm eating a bowl of kashi.  Hey, hey, Jimmy eats the kashi, too.  No shit.  No shit is right.  No, it's a good shit.  Out of a gaping asshole. 
[03:01:30]  He eats his cereal out of an ass cave.  Some guy does that fucking feet dangling over his shoulders thing.  Spoon not included.  Gaping asshole.  The bowl gets smaller and smaller.  He spoons kashi out of a man's asshole.  Oh, that is horrible.  So, Bob, are you going to stop in?  I mean, you know, you want to just stop in and introduce yourself, see your new neighbors, maybe? 
[03:02:00]  What?  Yeah, stop in.  Say hi.  See who the fuck's hanging out.  Have, like, a yellow hanky, like, casino and cruising, and they'll yell at you because you're fucking wary of the United to go in the showers.  When me and Norton, when he was looking for his apartment, we lived together, I told him, I was explaining the building that we, you know, I lived in.  And I was like, it has a doorman, it has parking, it has dry cleaning, a gym, everything, elevators.  And then he's like, yeah, yeah.  And then I go, plus, there's a trainee bar on the corner.  He's like, all right, where do I go to sign up? 
[03:02:30]  He would drive by the house every night and pretend to miss the house.  Whoops.  He'd go like this every night.  Whoops.  Whoopsie.  Oh, yeah.  Gotta make the old U-turn.  Yeah.  All right, well, I'm fucking, I'm just kryptoniting everything.  No, did you hear about the 101-year-old woman that got punched in the face three times?  Yeah, I was really surprised at the perpetrator.  I mean, I'm not sure what that was.  The description of his clothing was so accurate on the news, you never would have known.  Yeah, the news, well, he said it was a man in his 30s. 
[03:03:00]  So, any old ladies, look out for a man in his 30s.  Let that be a fucking, let that be a 100-year-old black woman getting punched in the face by some young white thug.  And the fucking marches would be from here to Brooklyn.  Oh, yeah.  You'd watch how fast they would jump on that.  It would be a hate crime.  It would be, yeah, marches, outrage.  I think he should have raped her.  I mean, why not?  While you're there.  On camera, imagine seeing that.  Her knocked out fucking cotton candy hair on the floor as he's just pounding her. 
[03:03:30]  He wipes his cock off with her hat.  He tries to get away, and she grabs him and pulls him back in because she hasn't seen one of those since 1972.  She wants more of that deep dicking.  Deep dicking is her lip bleeds pressed up against the elevator doors.  Her shoe has fallen off her foot.  It's just askew with that dark, thick stocking on, that orthopedic stocking. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, man.  Oh, he's giving her a savage ass fucking counting her money while he raced her.  Oh, you've got to love that guy.  You've got to love that.  The old broad took three hits, man.  Yeah.  Once you went down.  Dude, how bad are you going to do in prison when there's video of you punching 101 people?  I know, man.  And not knocking her down.  Takes the fucking, like, fourth punch before she hits the floor.  But he held her head.  He held her head.  He held her head on the floor.  He grabbed the side of her head, punched it twice.  Her hat went flying off.  Yeah, that's what made it sad for us when her hat went flying. 
[03:04:30]  Her little hat.  Because, you know, she knitted it because she had nothing else to do.  She was proud of her little knit hat.  Maybe her grandson gave it to her for Christmas.  He bought it at a church auction.  Yeah.  The grandson that doesn't really give a shit anymore but decide,  I've got to send her something.  She's lonely.  Yeah, Jimmy.  Grandson, how about fuck him, too?  He's in his 60s.  Enough already.  That's true.  Enough with his family and her show-off knitted hat.  Fuck yourself, will he?  She really did take one. 
[03:05:00]  What a scumbag, though, man.  They're looking for him.  They'll have him by tomorrow.  They'll have him by tomorrow's show.  You watch.  Yeah, someone will rat him out.  Yeah, absolutely.  I hope so.  But, I mean, like all of you, I was completely shocked when I saw what the perpetrator looked  Oh, I know.  Never would have guessed.  You just wouldn't have guessed.  Doesn't fit the profile.  Not at all.  By the way, Jimmy, I know what this is all about.  You've been stuck with Kenny since Thursday, and you just need to finally talk to a real  human being.  I needed human contact.  I needed somebody who actually blinked when I'm looking in their direction.  What was the one dumb thing Kenny did this weekend? 
[03:05:30]  Besides implying that Jenny might be gay, which I'm like, no, we had a girlfriend.  He's all, I don't know.  I'm trying to get if he did anything else stupid.  I mean, it was pretty much, it was kind of hard to fuck this one up.  We just walked from the hotel to the club.  Just your basic stupidness.  Yeah, I mean, there really was, there was nothing.  I mean, he handled everything, you know, perfectly well.  Oh, here's the bad, the bad fucking news.  I was like, well, as we're going from Pittsburgh to Newark, I'm like, man, thank God, or Newark  to Pittsburgh. 
[03:06:00]  I'm like, dude, I'm so sick of flying.  Thank God.  We got an hour flight.  A nice easy one.  He goes, yeah, but two out of the next three weeks, you got to fly cross country.  Mr. Bad News, of course.  I'm going to fly with Mohammed Atta.  Fucking Kenny, man.  He's amazing.  He's got an appearance, doesn't he?  Today.  Yes, he does.  He does.  Kenny has an appearance at noon, I think.  Him and Stupid E-Rock are both in. 
[03:06:30]  Yeah, in Times Square.  Broadway between 47th and 48th Street.  Yeah, stop by and say hello to them.  The Sunglass Hut.  Yeah, Ray-Ban.  What is Eric going to do there?  Is Eric going to do, what is he, who's modeling sunglasses or something, Ray-Bans?  Yeah, I guess, yeah.  Oh, what's he going to do?  What Kenny ought to do is take the sunglasses and hold them over his hair, and when his hair  doesn't catch fire, he goes, see how good these work?  How are they going to get sunglasses to fit those eyes of his?  They're like an inch apart. 
[03:07:00]  They're going to have to just, like, fucking cut it and put one lens over it, like, that's  nice.  Both.  I'm Cyclops.  We got E-Rock in studio.  What are you doing at the appearance?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Do you have something planned that you and Kenny are going to do?  No, they just said, all you have to do is just stand there.  Just stand.  It's going to be, like, fucking work for you.  How's that?  I can do that.  Jimmy's on fire.  So you're just going to stand there?  Jimmy's lonely.  Pretty much, yeah.  Wow.  He's lonely.  You're so lonely, you had to call your pals, because you're not getting this conversation 
[03:07:30]  with Kenny.  Dude, this is more than I said to him in four days.  Oh, I know that.  Yeah, we ate at P.F. Chang's day and just stared at each other over awful Chinese food.  It was fucking horrendous.  And he tries to, like, start conversation now, that's his new thing, and it's just so  awkward and awful.  Yeah, it's just never fun and lighthearted.  It's almost like you see him going through the fucking Doom, the Doom encyclopedia.  What can he do?  It's meant he's first Doom.  Right. 
[03:08:00]  You see on the Holocaust, what's that?  Genocide in Africa, it's really happening over there.  Yeah?  Is it?  Could I have a lemonade, please?  Do you know what's going on in the Sudan?  I mean, really, it's crazy.  They're hacking each other with machetes.  Are they, Kenny?  Hey, Bobby, did you move in here to a fucking place yet, or no?  No, not yet.  I've got to have all the floors and bathroom and all that stuff done.  Okay.  How long is that going to take?  I don't know.  I was supposed to paint myself, but I can't do it. 
[03:08:30]  My fingers are too thin.  Paint yourself?  My fingers are too thin.  I think you meant paint your own body.  I'm like, how many gallons is that going to take?  Jesus.  Well, he did admit that he was painting for eight minutes, and he got out of breath.  I really did.  I painted the ceiling for eight minutes, my shoulder started to hurt, and then I went  and I sanded something for like five minutes.  Why don't you just fucking lay on the back like nickel antelope?  Pretty funny.  How hard is it to paint?  I don't like that Jimmy's been in shape for like a week and a half. 
[03:09:00]  He's giving me fat jokes.  Dude, I'm really not in shape, though.  I'm like an almost decent human with just like a fucking layer of fat wrapped around.  I looked at Bob today.  And I went, hey, how's that diet going?  And then I gave him like Rodney Dangerfield eyes and looked at his belly.  He gave me Muppet eyebrows.  Did you go to the...  I'm sorry, man.  I was wondering if you went to the gym with Kenny.  No, Kenny went two days. 
[03:09:30]  I actually, yesterday, I did crunches and then fucking push-ups in my room.  I worked out two hard days before I left.  I ate pretty well when I was away.  I didn't eat anything really shitty.  Kenny's an animal in the gym.  It's scary what he lifts and he's...  No reaction.  Yeah?  No grunts?  No.  No.  He has the same face when he's fucking handing you money or when he's...  Yeah.  It's creepy.  He doesn't even sweat.  No.  No.  It's scary how much he can lift.  Yeah?  Yeah.  It's ridiculous. 
[03:10:00]  I remember when Norton...  When we first started working out together, he did the stair step of the pre-core.  Yeah.  And the stair step and his knees would go like backwards.  He kept saying the machine was broken.  But he literally...  He had no muscle on his leg.  So it just would fold backwards.  I kept giving him my machine because I was on the same machine, but it worked.  And he'd get on mine and the same thing would happen to him.  It was just like he had no muscle on his leg.  Holy shit.  It would fold back like a flamingo.  I was going to say, yeah. 
[03:10:30]  I was trying to think of what animal where it goes too far.  Oh, shit.  That's awful.  Now he hits the...  I went and worked out with him like a couple months ago.  And Norton, he punches the bag like he just...  Like, you know, like if his father just molested him.  He's just punching his shin.  You think it's the father?  Well, whatever.  I always thought uncle, whoever it is.  He really just punches the bag like an animal for three minutes.  Three minutes punching something for three months is a long time.  And he does...  How many rounds do you do, Norton?  Ten?  I do between eight and ten.  Jesus. 
[03:11:00]  Wow.  He just punches it with rage.  I'm not a faggot.  I'm not a faggot.  I'm not a faggot.  You know, right now, as I'm talking to you guys, I'm totally naked standing in my room.  And I don't know what's been going on since yesterday.  My cock is never looked thinner and more awful.  Dude, it's like a straight pigtail.  I'm fucking so distusted.  It's like pin the child's dick on me on the pigtail. 
[03:11:30]  Why are you naked?  I don't want to hear your naked talking up, you faggot.  What a fucking...  Oh, what a game.  Here's the interview.  One last night, I'm fucking talking to my girlfriend online.  We're having, like, cyber sex.  And she's not really into it that much, but I'm kind of getting her into it.  I'm being really dirty.  And then I said something that fucking mentioned the word love in it, and it took her out of the fantasy.  Two lines later, she's like, all right, well, I'm going to go.  I'm going to watch this movie for a little while and go to bed.  And I'm like, what movie?  And she goes, Ace Ventura, Pet Detective. 
[03:12:00]  I'm trying to talk dirty to my girlfriend.  I mentioned love, and it disgusts her so much.  I'm going to watch a Jim Carrey film.  Oh, that's great.  Not even the first one, the second one.  Oh, wait, no, it was Ace Ventura, Pet Detective.  That's the first one, isn't it?  Yeah, whatever.  Who could even tell?  Who knows anymore?  Yeah, and I've never seen the second one.  I just, you know, I don't know.  Well, Jimmy, they're saying you've got to go.  Yeah, believe me, I know.  They're saying that it's fucking 948 they've been saying that. 
[03:12:30]  People are saying that you need to go.  They're saying they've got to get you out of here.  And I look behind me, and there'd be nobody there, and I'm talking to anybody.  I say, where?  Who?  Who's saying that?  No one.  Then what happened, Jim?  Well, see, on the phone it's easy, but Jimmy's right.  The guests will be right in front of us, and they're like, yeah, they're saying you've  got to go.  And the guests will look around like, why?  Oh, where?  Who's they?  It's so unkind of this.  There's no one signaling.  It's like, well, you would look and nod your head, and go, oh, yeah, they're saying you've 
[03:13:00]  got to get out of here.  And I look behind me, and it's a wall.  They're telling us.  They're telling us you've got to go.  All right, Jimmy.  You'll be back tomorrow?  Yeah, yeah, I'm back tomorrow and Wednesday.  Tomorrow and Tuesday, and then...  Tomorrow and Tuesday.  Tomorrow and Wednesday, and then Wednesday afternoon, I fly to L.A. to do the Ontario  Improv, so...  We only get you two days this week.  Yeah, I didn't realize the schedule was like that, actually.  I thought I was doing the Ontario Improv next week.  Aw.  Well, what are we going to get?  Yeah. 
[03:13:30]  But I have a lot of jokes I'm going to bring.  Some funny stuff I've been preparing.  Well, they're having a problem with our We for We contest already.  Why?  We'll figure it out, though.  Well, they're getting a little uppity over the other place.  They're getting nervous.  Do you know, honest to God, my cock head is the size of a dime right now.  It's fucking horrifying.  I have a decent dick, and it just shrunk in a shame...  It's because you're talking to us.  Thank God it's shrunk.  No, but I mean, it's been like this since yesterday.  I was kind of flogging it online, talking to my girlfriend. 
[03:14:00]  I wasn't jerking you up.  I was just kind of flogging it lazily.  Vlogging?  Yeah, just being a goose.  I'm trying not to desensitize it anymore.  And it's just fucking...  It's embarrassing, man.  If she fucked someone else, I'd actually give her a pass.  And then what happened?  I believe it.  I'm so lonely.  I'll just...  And then what happened until you're fucking...  Until I hear fucking Ron and Fez talking.  I'm just a lonely man.  Oh, look at the fucking reaction you're getting now from Paltok. 
[03:14:30]  People are saying, Jimmy, you're just phoning it in.  And then they say, wow, he's eating it on the air.  All right.  All right, Jimmy.  All right, good.  Way to hang with a fucking petering out pun.  Hey, Grady, a black name or a white name?  It's probably a black name, although the way Grady used it in The Shining was how it  should tie in with blacks.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, Grady.  I don't know about The Shining thing.  You know, I swung and missed so hard on that one.  He does not. 
[03:15:00]  I appreciate it.  I thought it was pretty good, Jim.  Thanks.  All right, good.  Well, that's good when your fucking friends are pitting you.  Hey, no, you didn't do it, Jim.  I'm a fucking...  I'm an eight-year-old in Little League who just fucking got tagged out at first base.  By the way, did you hear about the booing?  Yes, I did.  I heard you coming in.  It was awful.  My first question is, if you're not allowed to boo, how is fucking MC supposed to know when  Voss is done with his ex?  There you go.  Drag Voss into it.  Nice.  Please, I have to. 
[03:15:30]  All right, guys.  I'll see you tomorrow.  I'm not going to get greedy.  I'm going to end on that.  All right, Jimmy.  Where are you going to be flying out to this weekend?  Ontario.  Oh, he got me.  He got it out.  There's no hanging up on Jimmy.  He's quick.  He's quick.  He's quick.  Hey, let's talk to the couple from Houston.  See what they're all about.  This show is so fucking different over here.  Oh, yeah.  Over there, it's just like, break.  Come on, let's go.  Well, we got to be more organized and formatted.  I hope he's like, bring those motherfuckers in. 
[03:16:00]  No, I like both the shows.  I like having a little structure, and then I like to freewheel a little bit.  We're freewheeling now.  What's, uh...  Oh, God.  I'm yawning.  What is Half a Hulk Face doing here, though?  I don't know.  You probably need to get warm.  Hey, Half a Hulk Face.  What's up, guys?  How y'all doing?  No, what are you doing here today?  I'm letting you guys know, if you guys haven't heard already, I'm going in for surgery soon.  Oh, you are?  Yes, I am.  Appendectomy?  What are you getting done?  They're going to try to take out the whole tumor.  Oh, oh, your face.  They're going to try to take out the whole tumor. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah.  If you find a doctor that's willing to try this.  Wow.  Awesome.  God damn.  I just asked about that, didn't I?  That's like...  You know what it is, though?  It's like...  You ever cast...  You ever go fishing, and you cast out your line, and it just goes...  And bunches up into a big knotted mess?  Yeah.  That's what the tumor is in his face.  It's not just like you could go in and cut it out.  The fucking thing is just like entangled and everything, right?  Yeah.  It's all kind of...  So, what do you usually wind up doing with that reel? 
[03:17:00]  You throw it out.  It's just trash.  Which side of the face are they going to fix?  Which side?  Jesus.  There's only one broken side.  Stop squinting.  I was just...  So, the left...  They're going to fix...  The right side.  They're going to...  His right, your left.  Are they going to just take that side off and...  Yeah, what are you going to lose in the process?  Well, what they're saying that they...  What they want to do is they're going to go in and take out the whole tumor, but after  they take out the tumor, they got to take out the jaw on the right side. 
[03:17:30]  Get the fuck out of here.  The whole jawbone?  They got to take it out.  So, they're taking a piece of your hip?  Yep.  Yeah, see?  What?  You're losing your jaw?  Yeah, for a while.  But they take a piece of his hip bone and build a new jaw.  No, he...  No!  He said they're taking the jaw out, and they're going to clean it up a little bit and then  throw it back in your mouth?  Well, that's what you're saying that they want to do.  Holy shit, this science is getting a little creepy.  So, they take your jawbone out.  Yeah.  And what if they break it or they can't use it? 
[03:18:00]  Well, I guess they got to go for the hip.  Holy shit.  I'll be walking with the limp for the rest of my life.  Well...  Well, at least...  Oh, God!  I still have a jaw.  Wow.  What else are you losing?  Teeth?  Teeth already gone.  Oh, yeah.  You don't have teeth?  Nope.  So...  Oh, really?  What about your eye socket and all that stuff?  We will see.  And what about the ear?  Can they lift that up, or are you going to have to tie it to the other ear with a piece  of string?  Well, they're going to try to do a reconstructive surgery on the ear, too. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  He said an ear lift.  Wow.  Yeah, I did say that.  So, dude...  So, they're going to...  An ear lift.  So, they're going to...  Well, look at that.  So, they're going to take your ear.  Are they going to make the ear...  Are they going to, like...  Are they going to shrink it?  Can they put it in an easy-bake oven and...  Yeah, like a shrinky-dink.  Like a shrinky-dink?  Yeah, they'll cut it and then remold it into an ear.  Yeah.  And that...  And where'd you get the money for this?  Someone paying for it?  Insurance or something?  Nope.  Well, the doctors are already starting to bill me.  Medicaid's paying for a little bit. 
[03:19:00]  The rest of it, I don't know.  What is this going to cost?  Who?  I have no clue.  It's going to cost a lot of money.  But it's got to be hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Why should he care?  He's not going to make it through the surgery.  Oh, Jesus.  He certainly will.  It's wrong with you.  You know what?  It's funny you mention that.  What is it?  Last surgery I had on my tumor, you know, I almost died.  I flatlined for about a good minute and a half.  Get the fuck.  Yep.  Now, what...  Why is that? 
[03:19:30]  I don't know.  Freaking mood sweep begins.  I'll probably be in dad's house.  Yeah.  They revived me some.  So who...  Like, did you go to the hospital and say,  Hey, I want this done?  Or did someone approach you?  A doctor?  Someone approached me, but, you know,  I started seeing the doctor again,  that I was seeing before.  Is this some guy who just wants to kind of,  you know, experiment?  Say, Hey, I think I could do this.  Dude, why don't...  It's actually a doctor at one of the hospitals here in the city.  A doctor at...  That's Israel.  Why don't we get a TV show to pay for this? 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, dude.  Why don't you get a TV...  Like Discovery or A&E or Animal Planet.  One of the...  Like home improvements.  I am not an Animal Planet.  Today, we're going to help a camel with cancer  and fix half a Hulk face.  And half a Hulk face.  Boy, that would be a great show,  like one of those inspirational shows that they have.  All that's actually in the works.  So you're going to do that?  Oh!  With who?  Jack.  Jack's helping me out with that.  Jack.  See, that's what we should do. 
[03:20:30]  All right.  Yeah.  Or someone should do.  So when is this going down there, half a Hulk?  Only thing I'm waiting on is on paperwork from Social Security.  Since they have my complete medical history,  the doctors want to see that.  So that way, they want to know what to do when they go in there.  Be a fucking tractor trailer full of forms there, huh?  Yeah.  Oof.  So when is it?  You don't know?  Only thing I'm waiting on is paperwork.  No, I understand.  Probably within the next month, maybe two.  All right.  Does your right nut hang down to your knee?  No. 
[03:21:00]  Is it just your face?  Just your face.  So you only have a tumor right there.  That's it.  You don't have it?  Well, I have smaller ones.  Where are they?  All over my body.  But that's the mainly prominent one.  So you have tumors all over your body.  But they're not as big as that.  No.  Did it start as a pimple and you just let it go?  Picking it?  It started small.  Growing up, the doctors didn't know what it was.  Right, right.  So my mother was an RN.  So she sat there, was taking me around to all the doctors in Southern California.  By the age of nine, I saw every doctor from San Diego all the way up to Santa Barbara. 
[03:21:30]  And basically none of them knew what the hell I had.  One of my mom's co-workers said, go see this doctor.  Maybe he can help you.  The doctor Frankenstein?  No, Dr. Ash.  He did my first, what, four surgeries growing up.  Dr. Ash.  So when he found out that it was a tumor?  Yeah.  Does it get bigger?  Well, it has gotten bigger.  So if you didn't touch it, would it just keep getting bigger until your jaw was on the floor, like huge? 
[03:22:00]  Well, the last major surgery I had was back in 91.  If I didn't have that surgery, I would have been dead already.  Really?  Because a tumor right now, well, even back then, it was getting closer to the esophagus.  And it would have just suffocated me at one point.  Wow.  Jesus.  Wow.  Fucking body kills yourself.  So this might, he might be able to take this, take this out, undo it, put your jawbone on a table, fix it, stick it back in, take your ear, shrink it down, and then you might have a good, you might look semi-decent. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, semi-decent.  People have actually photoshopped him where they've taken the other side of his face and mirrored it with Photoshop and then put it together.  And it looked like a normal guy, you know.  And then they did the same thing with the other side and he looked like Jay Leno.  Well, half a Hulk.  All right.  Yeah, half a Hulk.  Keep us updated.  Of course.  Looking forward to that. 
[03:23:00]  Good luck.  How long is it going to take?  The recoup is probably...  You're going to be without a jawbone file.  Well, I don't know what to do about the jaw, but when they work on a jaw, my jaw is going to be wired shut for a while.  So he's sucking everything through a straw.  Imagine he gets it all fixed.  He walks out of his apartment and some black guy grabs the side of his head and punches him in the face.  His jaw just flies across and show up into a gay bar and they fuck it.  Fuck, Bob.  Sorry.  Whatever.  I'm just trying to bring things together, the whole show. 
[03:23:30]  Of course.  Could that lady from Houston be leaning any further?  Yeah, she's uncomfortable.  Let's talk to her.  Well, she's pregnant.  Man, she doesn't want to catch what happened.  Uh-oh.  She's pregnant?  You're pregnant?  Wow.  You guys don't want to talk to us.  We're boring.  No, no.  No, believe me.  We want to.  We love it.  We want to.  Yeah, you're pregnant and that's little Grady.  She bore me to death on the walkover.  I figured we would do it for two countries.  She's a nice young lady. 
[03:24:00]  I hope you're so surprised you were so nice.  Yeah, I know.  Don't tell anyone, please.  And then you're all mean.  Because then they ask for money and stuff.  Anthony, we do your 40s announcer guy voice at home all the time.  Ah, wonderful.  Very good.  What'd you do to the baby?  A lot of people do that.  Yeah, do it to the Grady.  Teach him right.  Baby's doing June.  And you asked me about the name Grady.  Yeah, we thought it was an Irish name when we looked it up.  I mean, not that we care.  But everyone that we talk to.  And here it looks like she's blowing Nathaniel off to me from this angle. 
[03:24:30]  It really does look like she's just sucking his cock from this angle.  Nathaniel is just standing and, you know, feeding the microphone to her face.  Sean's an Irish name.  If she was blowing, that's the expression Nathaniel would have, just standing there looking,  not blinking like a doll from the 1800s.  What about Sully?  Or Brian or something.  Or Sean, like Anthony said.  No, we like the name.  It's just that his parents don't like it.  And they think that it's funny.  So you guys definitely like Grady. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Did you just look it up in a book?  No, we just got a random email from someone we didn't know.  And he had that name and we liked it.  Random email from someone you don't know?  Yeah.  It's a long, boring story.  I'm saving you guys.  What about the...  From Nigeria?  No.  Do you have a backup name?  No, that's it.  He's already named, you know.  You named him.  You can't name it.  It's in your belly.  You can still rename it.  Is he still in your belly?  Yeah.  So you can change it?  Yeah, you can change the name.  I don't want to change it.  You don't want to name your kid.  Don't name your kid Grady, please, for the love of him. 
[03:25:30]  He sounds like he's 85.  What are you going to call him for short?  Grady?  It's a good name.  Hey, get Grady Cheese over here.  It's Grady.  Do you ever see Sanford and Son?  Fred?  Sanford and Son.  That's the other thing everyone always says.  Yeah.  I never even watched that show.  Well, obviously, I never would have called you Kid Grady.  Yeah, don't call you Kid Grady.  How's that, sir?  Oh, he's going to be small, so we want to give him some instant street cred. 
[03:26:00]  Oh, is that it?  Why is he going to be small?  Because we're so short.  We're not.  Aw.  No, you didn't seem that short.  I'll tell you.  He's 5'6".  5'6".  All right.  It's not that bad.  It doesn't matter, though.  He could come out real tall.  You never know.  And Black.  Yeah, and Black.  She said and Black.  And Black.  Well, Houston, do you get a lot of Katrina people where you are?  Yeah.  Yeah?  How's that working out?  The crime's gone up.  Yeah, we heard about that.  Read about it. 
[03:26:30]  Any Katrina victims in your area?  No, we live in a nice area.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  The victims of Katrina victims.  That would be you.  Those are the victims.  Katrina victims now are the residents of Houston.  Well, we did have tile guys.  It's the hurricane that keeps on giving.  They what?  They stole our phone and ran up a $1,400 bill, and Sprint is making us pay.  A tile guy?  Yeah.  Why are they making you pay?  I don't know.  That's bullshit. 
[03:27:00]  You've got to be more aggressive.  You guys can get on it for us.  All right.  Let's go back.  Well, we've got Tony from Cleveland.  He's got a question for Half Hulk Face.  Tony?  Hey, Half Hulk Face.  What up?  I was wondering if you're going to do a voiceover on the new ABC show about the Geico caveman.  Yeah, you kind of have that Geico caveman thing.  Oh, the caveman talk thing.  A little bit.  A little bit.  Frunkets.  Yes.  That might not save your phone call, sir.  Yeah, it doesn't.  All right.  This is a little bit of a caveman.  Let's see if you got attacked by a T-Rex. 
[03:27:30]  Who are we pointing to?  Why him?  Oh, you drove eight hours from North Carolina, right?  Just to see this?  Yes, just to see this.  How disappointed are you?  When did you realize that you probably should have stayed home?  I had nothing better to do.  I was drunk on Pal Talk all last night, so I'm leaving as soon as the show's over.  And going back to North Carolina?  Yep.  I got to go back to work tomorrow.  That's a hell of a drive.  You were drunk when you started, right?  See, we're doing something special for the listeners on Friday.  You should have done it Friday. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  I had a three-day pass this week.  I think we got some shirts and maybe some food for the listeners on Friday.  What do you do for work that you get a pass?  You in the Army?  Yes.  Oh, really?  Oh, you are?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  What's your rank, soldier?  I'm specialist.  Really?  Well, I'm a master sergeant on Rainbow Six on Xbox 360.  So next time I walk in the fucking room, stand at attention.  How's that sound?  How's that sound?  That sounds like a deal.  That sounds like a fucking deal.  Rainbow Six.  And don't eyeball me, bitch. 
[03:28:30]  Fucking Rainbow Six joke.  What are you doing in the Army?  What's your...  I'm a parachute rigger.  Oh, yeah?  Yep.  What are you, 82nd Airborne?  No, 18th Airborne Corps.  18th?  Oh, yeah.  So they got to keep you happy.  You jump, though?  Yeah, I jump about once every couple weeks.  Jump in the dark?  Yeah, that's the worst.  Keep your legs tight.  Look to the left.  Thanks for the advice.  You got it.  We're going to take a break, then. 
[03:29:00]  Wow.  Anybody else want to talk?  What about you guys in the back?  Who's that?  They're latecomers.  Where are you guys from?  We drove up from Philly.  We left at six, and we just got here.  Sweet.  What's your shirt say?  Deutschland.  Great.  We got one with a fucking Nazi symbol on his shirt, then we got Deutschland, and then  we got half a hull face.  That's great.  It's a hell of a crowd.  And then we got Nathaniel that looks like the leader of the mall with his new haircut.  Half a hull face is like one of Mengele's experiments on a ride. 
[03:29:30]  Trying to make more skin so we can make bigger lampshades.  All right.  You guys got anything you want to add to this?  Just took the day off and came up?  We're putting up her sister from the airport.  Yeah?  Where's she flying in from?  Germany.  Montana.  Oh, cool.  Same thing.  Might as well be.  All right.  Yeah, same shit.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  All righty.  And got a couple other things.  We got to get to the MILF story. 
[03:30:00]  That's pretty cool, actually.  Yeah.  And yeah, there was some other thing.  Oh, yeah, that.  All right.  The O.P. and Anthony Show proudly presents an intimate moment with adult video star Diesel Washington and our own E-Rock.  Now, you can make this easy or you can make it hard.  You're going to do everything I say.  If you don't do anything I say, I'm going to smack you across the face.  I start off on your knees first.  Sniff my balls with your nose first.  Then I'll pull out my cock.  Shovel it in the back of your throat. 
[03:30:30]  Smack it across the face a couple of times.  Then bend you over.  Spit into your asshole.  Work two fingers in there.  Open it up in a circular fashion.  Then I'll work my fist in you.  Ah!  All right, I just walked to the bathroom, and there's a creep in the lobby.  Sam's running in.  What kind of creep? 
[03:31:00]  I guess he gave me a weird smile like, uh-oh.  I'm here to intern.  Oh, no.  I got an intern interview.  And then I go, Sam, who's the creep out in the lobby?  He goes, isn't he creepy?  And then it turns out that he, like, this guy used to intern for Sam's, like, college radio show.  Uh-oh.  What the hell's going on?  Dude, that guy scared me.  He looks like Jeffrey Dahmer.  Like a young version of Jeffrey Dahmer.  Yeah, that was one of the only people who ever interned for my show in college.  A college radio intern. 
[03:31:30]  Yes.  Wow.  And what's his deal?  Isn't that just like what the host is?  Pretty much.  On college radio, if you're the star fucking radio host on college radio, you're pretty much an intern.  Don't tell him that.  Oh, okay.  So, what's his deal?  Well, he's a big fan of the show, and he wanted to, uh...  Obviously.  He wants to intern here.  Look at him.  Oh, boy.  Look at this guy.  Okay.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Get a microphone on him.  It looks like he doesn't speak English.  Yeah, it looks like Sven. 
[03:32:00]  Hello.  He's a problem.  Yeah.  This is awesome.  I feel like the, uh...  You guys were just talking about this with the guy who just killed himself.  I was doing the interview through the window.  Yeah.  Like a prison.  And the other guys...  What do you mean?  I don't get it.  Never mind.  No, I'm serious.  I don't get it.  What are you...  You guys were just talking about that guy who killed himself.  This guy.  What guy?  The comedian.  Hey, did you have a...  Oh, Richard Jenny?  Yeah.  And what about that?  Well, I just feel like it's the same thing.  All right.  Through the window.  That you killed yourself? 
[03:32:30]  No.  Or you're bombing?  You're dying?  I'm bombing.  I'm bombing.  Did I get a car crash?  No.  No.  No.  You're an awkward...  Did you ever find a golden ticket in a chocolate bar?  Yes, I did.  That's it.  Trying to figure that out.  That's it, Bobby.  Charlie.  You won, Charlie.  Big fan of the show?  Oh, huge.  Yeah.  I've been listening since I was like 13 years old.  Wow. 
[03:33:00]  What do you like about the show?  You're not going to hang up on me, are you?  How can we hang up on you?  You're not on a window.  You're at a window, really?  We're going to pull the shade down?  I'm going to smash it with a chair.  It's never a dull moment, and I never stop laughing.  I mean...  You're not laughing now.  Yeah.  But...  I mean...  There goes the shade.  All right, listen.  Thanks a lot, Sam.  Sam.  Do you like Sam?  Yeah, he's an all right guy.  Hey, where'd you go?  Can't see you.  Hey, Jared!  How are we supposed to talk if we can't see you? 
[03:33:30]  Jared, crawl out the window over to the other window.  What?  No, I'm not doing that.  The one out on the ledge.  Yeah, I know.  I should kill myself.  Let's see.  So, there's a letter here.  Dear Steve.  That would be our own Steve.  Dear Steve.  Steve the Bear.  Ever since I was 13, I have wanted to work for this show.  I remember a childhood friend mine.  I remember a childhood friend mine.  Oh, no.  Going on about two radio guys. 
[03:34:00]  No, you didn't.  You didn't.  I had to say it twice because a lot of people know that I misspeak from time to time.  I definitely corrected that about five or six times.  You missed that five times.  No one's perfect.  Let me read it again.  Friend mine.  I remember a childhood friend mine going on about two radio guys named Opie and Anthony.  He explained to me the whole wow campaign.  The next day, we made huge wow posters and walked around Shea Stadium looking to get wowed.  After seeing a pair of breasts.  After seeing a pair of breasts. 
[03:34:30]  I swear to God.  After seeing a pair of breasts from a drunken woman in the parking lot, I was hooked.  Since then, I've become an Opie and Anthony junkie.  Is she a cancer?  Since then, I've become an Opie and Anthony junkie.  I listen just about, if not, every day for as long as I possibly can.  When I heard they moved to satellite.  Just about?  If not?  What?  Wait.  Read that sentence again.  I listen just about, if not, every day for as long as I possibly can.  When I heard they moved to satellite, I went out and bought an XM. 
[03:35:00]  I get what the show's about.  Making fun of people with cancer and AIDS.  Seeing beautiful naked women.  Opie being an asshole.  Jim being a creep.  And Anthony doing the occasional impression.  Occasional.  I understand what it takes to be an intern and look forward to taking on the task.  Do you?  I really look forward to getting abused by you guys.  Would you do something, Bob, you got maybe something he could do?  Yeah, I want you to put half a Hulk's Haste tumor in your mouth.  Haste?  Haste.  Am I guaranteed an internship? 
[03:35:30]  I was trying to talk and misspelled.  No, there's no guarantees in life.  That's something we try to teach you.  I want to see, put your little ass cheek against the glass.  Your little Dutch ass cheek.  Why do you want to see that?  Why would you want to see that?  Why does it have to be his naked ass?  I don't know.  Why?  I don't think Bobby's the guy to ask.  All right.  You're right.  Just put the tip of your cock on.  You're right.  I was being a little guy.  So what do you think about your buddy over here actually being a paid employee for the Opie and Anthony show? 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  What do you do as a Sam intern?  You need to relax a little bit.  Put your arm down.  Relax.  Relax.  You're showing weakness by doing that.  Yeah, relax.  Hold that mic.  This shows weakness.  There you go.  What did you do as Sam's intern?  I came on and I received abuse from him.  What kind?  He'd make me do stuff.  I had to go on.  I was contesting on his.  He had a sidekick named Beef.  Beef?  Beef.  It was not the name I gave him. 
[03:36:30]  That's his actual name.  Yeah.  He's kind of a psychopath, but he's fantastic.  So what did you do?  I had to sing Save Beef Karaoke.  There you go.  Beef Karaoke Challenge.  Wow.  Sam tried to sell that.  Yeah.  It was good.  Jared was also a contestant in Win a Date with Beef.  Yeah, in which Sam played the theme song from The Price is Right.  He's got a little thing for that.  Yeah.  Yeah, we have noticed that.  Are you guys the same age? 
[03:37:00]  No.  I'm a sophomore, incoming junior, and Sam just graduated.  Oh, okay.  You had to sing a song?  Yeah.  What was the song?  Sing the song.  It was Barbara Ann.  Sing it.  Oh, he was good, too.  Sing it.  Go.  Sing it now.  Go.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  Barbaran  You got me rockin' and rollin', rockin' and reelin' 
[03:37:30]  Barbaran, ba-ba, ba-ba-baran  We did another bit called...  It comes right in.  Jared, intern of a thousand voices.  He does voices.  Nice.  Take it away.  Why don't you tell...  What could he do?  He did impressions.  Do some of your impressions, Jared.  Like what, Sam?  He did Rastafarian.  Let's hear that.  Yeah.  Let me shut my eyes.  Stand in the middle and put your arm down.  Be confident.  I am confident.  No, it shows weakness.  I told you right here. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, don't get snappy with me.  He was getting a little snappy with you, Bobby.  Do you hear that?  I will.  I'm not gonna fuck with him.  He looks like he has fucking retard strength.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Hey, man.  How you doing?  Going to smack a duchy tonight.  That's a Rastafarian.  All right.  Wow, yeah.  Got to give him that one.  What's the other one?  Give us another one.  So far, so good.  Give me something.  Southern.  A southern guy.  Yeah.  Sam, I challenge you to a duel. 
[03:38:30]  Holy shit.  All right.  That's south of the border there.  Do one like Louisiana.  Why?  It's a little different?  Well, yeah.  I mean, that was...  What was that?  Kentucky?  That would be like...  Georgia.  Georgia.  It's kind of like Georgia, I think.  Southern accent.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, so do Louisiana.  Yeah, get uppity.  Let's go.  Bonjour, mon chéri.  All right.  Do French.  Comment ça va?  Yeah, you suck.  Fuck you.  Oh, he does Frenchie. 
[03:39:00]  Do a Spanish guy.  I'll kill you for fun.  Do Cuban.  It's the same thing.  Do Mexican.  It's different.  It's a little different.  Hey, man.  See?  You got it.  Oh, wow.  That's a very subtle difference.  But what about Australian?  Crikey.  Hey.  What about English?  How are you doing?  Do New Zealand.  I can't do Kiwi.  Why?  New Zealand?  I can't do Kiwi.  Why?  I don't do Kiwi.  Why? 
[03:39:30]  I just don't do it.  Why?  Because it's just like Australian.  Not really.  There is a difference.  Yeah, Sam knows.  Of course, but it's very subtle.  You do German?  Can you do German for our friends in the back?  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'll pep us, Fraulein.  How about Finnish?  No, I don't know Finnish.  Can you take all your clothes off except for your underpants?  There you go.  Why?  Just take all your clothes off except for your underpants.  Yeah.  Because that would make you gay.  Yeah.  And illegal, probably.  Yeah. 
[03:40:00]  Do you have tighty-whities or boxer shorts?  Yeah, what do you got?  Jockeys.  Jockeys, yeah.  All right, go ahead.  All right, strip in front of everybody.  Yep, everybody.  Even the pregnant girl behind you.  Yep, have him hold the mic for you.  Believe it or not, this is your audition for an intern check.  No, no, no.  You know what?  You have to make him sing.  He has to da-na-na-na.  Oh, sing that song you sang.  What was that song?  What was that song?  Barbara Ann.  Yeah, sing that as you strip it, like, as a music.  Go ahead.  Keep going.  Barbara Ann.  All right, he's getting naked. 
[03:40:30]  Keep going.  Barbara Ann.  Louder.  Barbara Ann.  You got me rockin' and a-rollin' rockin' in a ring.  He's taking his shoes off as he says that.  Barbara Ann.  Someone's suggesting he does his Richard Jennings impression.  Barbara Ann.  All right, there goes the shirt.  I want this internship.  Sam knows I'll do anything for it, and this is why he put me on the spot. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, he did.  Do you really want me to take my pants off?  Keep going.  Keep going, Jared, from Subway.  Oh, that's funny.  It was funny.  Oh, Bobby.  Hey, you're going to take that.  How are you going to take that spider?  Keep going.  Keep going.  You really like this, don't you, Bob?  You get off on Bobby.  Keep going.  Yeah, I do.  I don't believe I'm doing this.  Yeah, you do.  I don't believe I'm doing this.  Just take your pants off.  You know what?  Fuck it.  Maybe do a sit-up.  I don't care.  Keep going.  Wow.  I'm a fat... 
[03:41:30]  No, you're like what Bob...  You're kind of skinny fat, it's called, right?  Yeah, he's got the upper torso of a 12-year-old, and then the lower torso of my uncle, David.  Are you really kidding?  Are you...  Homer.  Can I put my pants back on, please, for the love of God?  No, not yet.  All right, Bob, what else do you want him to do?  Well, first of all, the pants are still on.  Yeah, you got to take them completely off.  You got to take them completely off and put them on that chair over there.  Yeah.  Where Satan was sitting.  How could you just be...  How old is he? 
[03:42:00]  How old are you?  I'm 19.  I'm going to be 20.  How could you be 19 and be in that shape?  That bad a shape?  I'm just saying, like...  You don't play sports.  Like Bobby said, your gut is kind of like...  Your parents divorced.  Sign right there, please.  I guess you got to sign to be nude around here.  No, that's actually a Weight Watchers contract.  Like, I don't know...  Bobby!  It's an improv all weekend.  What happened?  Like, you ate a lot growing up or something? 
[03:42:30]  Yeah, swallowed a lot of aggression.  Aggression along a lot of pizzas.  A lot of pepperoni pizzas.  All right, what else do you want him to do, Bobby?  Okay, well, he's standing...  I don't know why he's standing the side way.  Yeah, why?  You think the profile...  That way, is that better?  Yeah, there you go.  That way, is that better?  That's a little better.  And you don't look as fat that way, actually.  You look flattened out a little bit.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  All right, stand in the middle,  because you've got to have confidence.  The arm is...  He's getting confident.  Yeah, I feel like he's getting better.  If I look at his gut area, 
[03:43:00]  it's almost time to leave.  Oh, what?  Well, hourglass and sand.  Oh, I got you.  I got you.  Did your appendix burst?  Listen.  Oh, there you go.  You're signing more stuff.  Sam, are you enjoying this?  Oh, yeah.  More than you know.  Sam is ruthless, man.  How many pages does this guy have to sign?  He's got to sign the nudity.  Five.  He's not nude.  He's not nude.  You know that anybody can get...  How far this was going to go?  Anybody can get a college radio show. 
[03:43:30]  You know that, right?  Yeah.  So why would you intern for one?  Yeah.  He did all of this except get naked on college radio  under the guise that he was interning,  waking up at 7 a.m.  to go down to a closet, barely a radio station.  Yeah, don't you know that, like, interns are college students?  Yeah.  So you don't...  That was kind of the joke.  You don't really intern for a college...  You should be working for a college radio station in some capacity.  Yeah.  Would you lay him over your knee and spank him? 
[03:44:00]  Well, I think...  I don't even know if I could put him over my knee  because he might hurt my knee  because I did have a knee surgery.  And I don't want...  But, I mean, if he wants to come in here,  I think he deserves a little spanking.  I think a little...  Just for fucking up and...  No bare bottom, though.  No, no, no, no.  All over his underwear.  I couldn't hear his bare bottom.  I don't want to fuck up that white flesh he has.  But, um...  Oh, God.  I think he should come in here  and take a little right over the table  and a little spanking for fucking up. 
[03:44:30]  For getting a little...  First of all, I think...  Because I think you guys like this kid, right?  I think he's doing good.  But...  I don't really think the interns have to go through this, but...  All right.  Yeah, I don't remember any of the other interns  having to go through this.  I wish fucking little Sam did.  What are they bringing in?  They're bringing in the chair.  All right.  Because Bob can't handle the body weight of Jared.  Not that you're fat or anything, Jared.  He's just got a bad knee.  I got a bad knee.  You remember?  It has nothing to do with you, Jared.  Jared, yeah.  All right, here comes Jared.  Is that his name, Jared? 
[03:45:00]  Is it Jared?  No, I just...  Is it Jared?  Yeah, it is Jared.  Oh, wow.  All right, Jared is now sitting in the studio  with just his underpants on.  By the way, there's a lot of people  around the joint today.  This is a lot.  Now he's like...  Now I understand what you're saying  about the creepy smile.  He's kind of looking around at us like,  wow, I'm finally here.  I finally made it.  Wow.  You're not on drugs, are you?  No.  What do you take?  There's something going on.  I don't do any drugs.  No, it's something that is prescribed, obviously.  What?  What do you got?  A little bit?  A little bit?  A little Xanax. 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, what is it?  I can tell.  Xanax.  A little Xanax, yeah.  Just a little bit.  I can tell.  Just up a little bit.  I got bad posture.  Yeah, well, it's not bad.  It's actually atrocious.  You can walk like a werewolf.  You're not going to kill yourself  after the abuse, are you?  No.  It's awesome.  Since he was 13 now,  he's been a fan,  and now he's here.  Yeah.  Is this anything like you imagined?  Oh, yes.  Really?  Really?  That you would be in your underwear, 
[03:46:00]  sitting there?  I knew I'd have to do something.  Circle the problem areas  on his body, all right?  No, I'm going to...  Something.  I'm going to...  I'm just going to...  First of all,  you have to turn around a little bit.  We have to go to the back first.  All right, we're going to circle  some problem areas.  The first problem area...  All right, turn around.  Turn around.  All the way.  All the way.  Show Anthony.  Sit the way you sit.  No, when you turn it all the way around,  I can't see where the problem areas are.  Well, the first problem area  is this patch,  random patch of hair.  Right there.  Right here, okay?  All right.  He's got a patch here,  a patch here,  and a patch here.  It's just random.  That's just random genetic fuck-up, 
[03:46:30]  by God.  Do you want to shave  that patch of hair, Bob?  Yeah, that patch should be shaved.  Do you mind if we shave  that patch of hair off?  That patch should be shaved off.  Get a razor in here  if you got one.  All right.  All right, and then we have this hump.  I don't know.  It's like half a Hulk's face  in his back.  Just right here.  Whatever this is.  Is it protruding?  I don't know.  It's just there's an indent here  that goes down to here,  and then it switches over here.  And then you have this.  For the people at home,  he's marking his entire back up  with a Sharpie.  Just on this side, though, 
[03:47:00]  if you see,  and then it goes down here,  and this is where you could  actually be in shape,  right here.  Right.  But then it just goes,  I mean,  literally just explodes here.  And there's lines.  I'll trace the lines.  What's those lines?  Those are stretch marks.  Stretch marks, okay.  And it looks like a fucking  map of Jersey right there.  All right.  And actually,  you've got a couple back here.  What is going on?  Is that like,  what's going on  with the left side of your body?  What are you talking about?  It's like a huge, 
[03:47:30]  like...  I was a morbidly obese child.  Morbidly?  Morbidly.  Like,  in high school,  I weighed 220, 230.  Oh, okay.  So you got your shit together.  This looks like a hip right here.  It does look like a hip.  It's like a hip,  like an asp right there.  And then he has this mole right here.  I don't know what that is.  I want to get that checked.  Yeah, all right.  Now turn around.  It's risen.  That's for the back.  What's going on in the front?  All right.  Turn to the front now.  He can straighten out your back.  Now, first of all,  I feel like I'm...  I feel like I'm doing... 
[03:48:00]  I feel like I'm doing a fucking...  An examination of my grandmother.  This...  First of all,  the chest right here,  the muscle.  Now, if you giggle,  can you giggle a little bit?  Can I tickle you a little bit?  Tickle.  See how they shake?  Yeah.  These two tits,  as I may call them,  they're not fucking pectoral muscles  whatsoever.  These two tits,  this one actually goes down here  and then comes over here  and this one goes down here  and it comes over here.  You have one line,  two lines,  and then that dent.  There's actually... 
[03:48:30]  And I'm not saying this  because I'm a little chunky too, bro.  Don't get fucked up.  You have a dent in your stomach.  That's where the fat just snapped.  Bob, show him your belly.  No, you're out of your mind.  Fuck you.  Show him your belly.  Step back, step back.  Look at this.  Step backs.  There's no hair here.  Right.  Okay?  He's marking his body.  There's hair  and then there's no hair  and then there's fucking hair  and watch out over here.  There's hair on his upper chest  and around his nipple  but in between nothing.  In between, there's nothing.  Like, he got flaws. 
[03:49:00]  But then just below  the shoulder blade  is more hair.  As Steve just pointed out,  there's a clump of hair  on his shoulder  on this side.  Can we turn him back again?  Turn him on this side  and then this fucking...  This half a werewolf  has hair on this side  over there.  And then, I mean,  Jesus Christ.  All right, get over there.  Yeah, get below the...  Right, right, right.  Can you pick your arm up  for a second?  Holy shit.  I don't know what this is.  It looks like...  Do you know the trail  of a comet?  That's what it looks like  underneath his armpits.  He was morbidly obese 
[03:49:30]  so he's got some stretch marks.  Yeah, he's got some stretch marks.  That's okay.  All right, well,  everybody has a little stretch marks.  Jeez, you ever hear  of cocoa butter?  Listen.  And then you get  this side over here.  Same genetic disaster  over here.  Okay?  But then...  What about the haircut?  You all right with the haircut?  Well, this is the thing  with the haircut.  Oh, no.  Augusta Gloop.  He looks like every character  in Willy Wonka  and the Chocolate Factory.  All right, just point out...  You can point out  with the Sharpie  what's wrong with that.  All right, well,  the fact is...  Do you mind if I do this?  I mean, because you really  want to be an intern, right? 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, whatever.  All right, well,  you've got an angry brow.  I don't want this fucking kid.  Yeah, show him  where the hairline should be.  Well, the hairline...  This is the problem,  is that...  Just stay still.  Don't get...  Don't move,  because I don't want  this to fuck up.  Now, if you show...  I'm just going to trace this,  and this is...  Okay.  That's where his hairline is now.  That's where his hairline is now.  Turn this way.  Turn this way.  Okay, this is where  the hairline is now.  Okay?  Stay there.  Little dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.  Now, if you look...  Holy shit. 
[03:50:30]  What the fuck is that?  Wow.  Let me say turn.  He has a two-inch forehead.  I just drew his hairline,  and it was his fucking hairline.  We were kidding.  I thought I was going to pull his hair up.  And he's got a great fucking set of hair, this kid.  Good for you.  Look at that.  You're a little jealous, aren't you, Bob?  I am jealous.  Look at that fucking hairline.  Bob was talking about hair plugs today for himself.  Yeah, can I borrow some from your forehead?  Sure.  Or his back, or those patches that he's...  He's got great hair.  Everything all right?  He could cut off patches off his back  and just glue it to your head.  I think so.  I think that's about it on this. 
[03:51:00]  I mean, you know what?  A couple months, he'd be fucking good.  He'd be done.  Why do you slouch so much?  Is that something wrong with your spine?  Yeah, I've got, like, really bad posture.  Why do you have bad posture?  From being morbidly obese?  Can we get a CD and put it on his head?  That will help.  Huh?  If you stand there with a book.  Back in the day.  70-pound, but what was that?  Your lunch?  You had a 70-pound bat?  Were you in the army at age of five?  No, lots and lots of heavy textbooks.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Oh, you were that kid that was hunched over all the time  with the books on his back?  Oh, yeah.  Well, I was in junior high school.  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:51:30]  Do you want to spank him now, Bob?  Well, I don't...  I think...  Are you ready?  Oh, there's the razor.  First, get rid of those errant hair patches.  All right.  Do you mind if we help you out here with the...  Sure.  All right.  Cool, dude.  Can you unclench your fist while I do this, please?  Because you're scaring me.  He's a big kid.  All right.  Here we go.  We're going to go on now.  Don't get scared.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  First of all, we're going to get...  Oh, my God.  I just got electrocuted.  Did you hear that?  Yeah, you can't hold the mic while you're on.  Could somebody tell me that?  What the fuck is that? 
[03:52:00]  You can't touch the mic while you touch the razor.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Or you get electrocuted.  Wow.  That sounds like a taser.  Does it hurt?  What the fuck is that?  No, it just tickles.  All right.  Just hold on to it.  I want to see how long you can hold on to it.  Fuck you up.  He actually got me on that.  Fucking carnival game.  Wait.  I want someone else to try that.  That's a new game.  All right.  What?  Electrocution game?  All right.  Shave that patch off his shoulder.  First off, I just want to...  For the people at home watching, we're going to shave off this patch.  Okay.  Now, stay still.  Can you unround and hunt? 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  Just put your shoulder back a little bit.  There you go.  Someone put a book on his head so he doesn't go back down.  Do we have a book?  Something.  He's got to balance a book on his head.  Yeah.  There we go.  Balance century sex on your head.  Put that straight in your back.  That's the legendary century sex.  We've had that for 10 years.  Don't move because we need that straight.  We need you straight.  Okay.  We're going to help.  This is helping your posture.  Yeah.  Okay.  There you go.  Look at that.  Look at that.  No hair there now.  Look at that.  Very good.  Look at that.  Look at that.  Look at.  Oops. 
[03:53:00]  You slipped down a little chest hair.  Sorry, dude.  Sorry about that.  Touch his nipple?  I wasn't.  I wasn't touching his nipple.  What about that one on the back?  His nipple's right here.  This is not his nipple.  That is his nipple.  That's his nipple.  Oh, jeez.  Listen.  Bobby's just shaving his chest.  All right.  Now turn.  Bob, touch the mic again.  Turn.  Wow.  It's fucking weird.  I don't know if it shocks me.  It's just the noise that scares me.  All right.  Here we go.  You can touch the XM thing.  Turn to the side, dude.  All right.  Turn to the side.  All right.  No, I'm joking.  Oh, you got scared. 
[03:53:30]  I wouldn't have to do that.  We can take a patch out of your head, right?  No.  No, no, no.  He's got great hair.  Grow back this afternoon.  All right.  Turn.  Turn.  Turn.  Back straight.  Back straight.  The other way.  Stand up straight.  All right.  Turn.  Turn.  You have the same fucking body as the person on that fucking DVD case.  All right.  God, his body's all marked up.  I'm going to get a patch that I missed over here.  All right.  Holy shit.  That little patch is annoying the shit out of me right there.  Where is that?  Where?  Right here?  No, no.  The one that's circled. 
[03:54:00]  Or was that?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's a mole you fucking...  Oh, well, cut it off.  I can't shave that.  Cut it off the back.  Bob, how does it feel shaving another guy, by the way?  It feels just like it felt yesterday.  The term's called manscaping.  Isn't that supposed to be, like, gentle?  Touch the mic.  It's leaving red marks all over him.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, because he's scraping them.  Oh, you know what?  I'm sorry, dude.  Am I hurting you, dude?  I don't want to hurt you.  No, I'm fine.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  That was gay.  Yeah, you look like you got scoliosis.  No, I don't.  I went to an orthopedist. 
[03:54:30]  Okay.  Yeah?  Cool.  Because your back's kind of hunched a little.  All right.  Like, even when you do that, it kind of sticks out.  Okay, hold that.  Like, you got, like, a fin.  I don't like that he has a scar on his knuckle because he punched a wall.  Is that where that scar came from?  Yeah, it came from karate.  Oh, great.  Oh, shit.  Good.  You got me fucking fighting a Dutch kickboxer.  I'm shaving this fucking nut.  What are you, a black belt or a brown belt?  I got a black belt in the American Olympic, and now I got a blue belt in Kemper.  Let's just shut this off.  Yes.  Okay, great.  I'm spanking my ass.  Oh, black belt.  Fuck yourself. 
[03:55:00]  Yeah, spin around again, and your cock's sticking out.  Want to fix that?  How could you be, uh...  You got a black belt, really?  Well, it was kind of BS, but now I'm taking it up at college, and I'm taking it again.  Was it an honorary black belt?  No, it was like...  I got to fix your hair.  He ran it a lot like a business, so it was...  Yeah.  I felt like I didn't deserve it.  You got a black belt in Moogoo Guy Pan?  Yeah.  The keynote some young guy.  Ah.  That old guy.  Show us the status.  Now you'll get it.  Show us the move.  Show us the move. 
[03:55:30]  I'm Bob?  No.  You want to show me a move?  No, because I get too much anger.  I don't know how to deal with that.  I'll flip out and punch him in the face.  No, it's a demonstration.  I can't be demonstrated on.  Get one of the...  You know what you get?  Oh.  This guy right here.  Fucking Satan.  Come on in.  Get the pregnant woman.  Yeah.  Will you do a demonstration?  Come on in, dude.  This guy will.  Do you not...  No, stand up.  Don't hurt the guy.  No, don't hurt anybody.  All right.  Do a demonstration.  Let me hold that.  Because you're in your underpants.  All right.  Just...  All right.  Stand right there.  You're shaving your back.  All right.  All right. 
[03:56:00]  Now, what is the move you're going to do?  Let's see here.  I'm trying to think of a good move to do.  All right.  You're a black belt.  You should have hundreds.  All right.  It's called Grasping Town.  Grasping Town.  Wait.  Okay.  Explain it first.  It's a right wrist grab.  Right.  And it's an outer wrist hook into a...  You snap the person's arm and then you give two elbow shots.  One to the face, one to the spine.  Okay.  Please, listen.  Don't really fucking hurt them.  Oh, no. 
[03:56:30]  I've done this before.  Okay.  Are you ready?  All right.  So what does he do?  Grab my wrist.  Grab his wrist.  Like, you're going to mug him.  Oh, don't know what they can do to it.  Broke his arm.  Jesus.  I do this on kids all the time.  On kids.  Great.  Teenagers.  Jesus.  On kids.  Master Poe is like, what the fuck?  Why don't you do it to Master Poe?  No.  Do it, Master Poe.  Come on in.  Get in here.  Come here.  Step back.  Tough.  Come on, black belt.  All right.  No.  No.  No. 
[03:57:00]  Was that right, Master Poe?  No.  No.  Was that right?  First of all, as a black belt, I don't know why you were using that much strength.  Yeah, that's true.  This guy's a beginner.  You're going to break his arm.  There's no reason for that.  Right.  That's true.  I said that.  I don't know.  Why don't you do a little move on the intern.  Scare the crap out of him.  I'm the potential intern.  You want me to do a move on you?  Yeah, do a move.  I'm not.  Oh, he's taking his coat off.  That's never good.  Well, he's taking his...  Oh, that's his tree off.  And all his homemade weapons.  He just took out his...  He just took his highlighter off.  That's not good.  So what was that wrist thing? 
[03:57:30]  No, you're grabbing me.  I'm the bad guy.  Okay, so you're grabbing me.  All right?  Yeah.  How many seconds?  He's going to shit himself.  Whenever.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, God!  Oh, wow.  Oh, is he down in a snap?  He's tapping.  He's tapping.  He tapped.  He tapped.  Fuck that!  Wow.  Yeah, fine.  Jared, good job.  Wow.  Good job, Jared. 
[03:58:00]  I wouldn't want to do that.  I wouldn't.  He tapped real quick.  Wouldn't you?  Dude, I'm over here.  Look at me.  I'm a pussy.  Oh, he was talking shit about you.  Bob.  Not him.  Bob.  Yeah, right.  Fucking out of your mind.  Are you talking garbage?  Yeah, I was talking garbage.  What are you talking about me, man?  No, literally.  I was talking about your hair.  No, I'm joking.  What?  So, you want to hit me, Bobby?  Po, get the fuck out of here.  Don't even joke. 
[03:58:30]  Shut your mouth and don't even joke around.  Oh, you're going to take that.  I'll be eating your caution puffs.  Oh, you're going to take that, Master Po.  So, why don't you hit me?  Come on.  Are you out of your mind?  Hit me as hard as well.  Are you out of your mind?  Come on, hit me.  Po, are you out of your mind?  Hey, it's okay.  Po superhero jacket.  I am not fucking.  You're out of your mind.  Do you think.  What do you think?  I'm a rookie at this shit?  Are you out of your mind?  Look at me.  Go in the other room and fucking make sure that  that kid knows that you were kidding.  I think you hurt his feelings.  He's right behind you.  Put your highlighter back.  There you go.  Put your Matrix sunglasses back on. 
[03:59:00]  You're out of your mind if you think  I'm fucking doing demonstration.  I jumped two inches and I snapped my ACL.  Do you really think I'm that fucking dumb  to let you, the bouncer at 2001 plays?  So, you don't want to grab me?  Are you out of your...  I don't want to fucking do anything to you.  I don't want to email you.  How's that sound?  I don't want to text you.  How's that sound?  You're not going to get to do...  I know you're hungry too.  You learned all that information  and you don't get to use it. 
[03:59:30]  You're not getting it on me.  Okay?  It's not happening.  I have a pinky that's numb  and I just got electrocuted.  It's not going down.  All right, Bobby.  Thank you.  I love you.  Yes.  Bye.  He said yes and bowed.  Fuck.  You're a pussy, Bobby.  You're a pussy.  Help me.  Suck my dick.  Honestly, I wouldn't want to deal with  either one of them.  Fuck that.  Jared, you did very good.  Jared was a good kid.  Don't fuck up the real interview  because we want you around.  All right.  But if you fuck it up,  I mean, it's not our decision. 
[04:00:00]  Just remember that  when you want to hurt somebody.  I like this kid.  He's got personality.  What do you want...  I mean, you got to get his personal.  What?  What do you...  What do you want to do  as far as an internship?  Like, what do you...  Where do you want that to take you?  A career.  A career in radio, I would gather.  On air, off air?  Producing.  Producing.  There you go.  Okay.  So you'll be working closely  with our own fan.  Does he have potential fan? 
[04:00:30]  He just licked him over  at all the marks on him  and got a lot of marks on you now.  He's a definite,  definite strong candidate for intern.  Right?  Right.  Steve, what do you think?  Forever.  You would hire him as an intern?  Forever.  Based on this little exchange here,  I would say intern.  Any other questions  you want to ask him?  We have some stuff  we'll ask him  if in the actual interview,  you know,  like academic type stuff,  but this is pretty much...  Don't put your clothes on, 
[04:01:00]  by the way.  Steve loves this.  Oh, yeah.  Steve's going to love this  when it's just you  and him.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  All right.  Jared, thank you.  Jared, thank you so much.  Good luck to you.  Good first foray  into this whole thing.  Yeah, go get your clothes  and...  Thanks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty good job, dude.  Put your clothes on.  The money's on the dresser.  All right, very good.  Wow.  How funny is Master Poe  that you can literally  just say,  like a Terminator,  go,  he is objective? 
[04:01:30]  Yeah.  Bob,  don't you want...  Did you say you wanted  to do something?  What?  He was looking at me like,  what'd you say about me?  Like, I really talk  some shit about him.  All right, Bob,  Addison Improv.  Addison Improv.  Dallas.  Coming weekend.  Thursday, Friday,  Saturday, Sunday.  Another bang-up job  from Bob Kelly today.  It was fun.  Whackbag is  instant feedback  in like crazy.  They want us to acknowledge  Save the Wave.  We lost a good one  over the weekend.  One of our faithful listeners  passed.  Oh, right.  They're talking about him  on Whackbag  if you want to go there. 
[04:02:00]  What happened to him?  Stroke?  Is that what I heard?  Wow.  Yeah, that's what I heard.  Unexpected.  It's a drag.  Wow.  So they're talking about him  over at Whackbag today.  That sucks.  Houston Couple,  anything else?  Thumbs up.  You're all right?  Have Hulk face.  Good luck with the operation.  Army dude,  thanks for coming up.  Philly 2,  hopefully it's a safe flight  from Montana,  I guess, right?  All right. 
[04:02:30]  She's not happy.  You all right?  You all right over there?  You don't want to be here?  He's the fan  and you're just here  for the ride?  Kind of.  I like you guys, too.  I just don't get to listen  because I drive the school bus  during the week.  For what?  For Central Bucks  School District.  No, I mean,  what age?  All of them.  All of them?  Yeah.  It's in Bucks County  so the parents  get a little upset  if their kids listen  to anything other than  Sesame Street.  Ew.  And while you're  doing the right thing,  some girl is blowing  some dude in the back, right? 
[04:03:00]  Yeah, pretty much.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  What?  That's what's going on  in the schools.  Why don't you pay attention?  I was talking to a teacher  this weekend at FH Riley's.  And what happened?  What did she say?  They said oral sex  is not even sex anymore.  They don't consider it sex.  Really?  In the schools.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wish I could go back  and fucking give me  a head all the time.  All right.  Line of the day  sponsored by  Bodogfight.com.  Here is the runner-up  line of the day.

I can't wait.  What?  The big announce?  Oh, Jesus.  Fucking.  Oh, no.  What happened?  What'd you do?  What?  You made a little announcement there.  No, we're off the air,  you idiots.  Yeah, of course we are.  Stupid Bob,  though we're still in the air.  You're not.  Look, it's stupid.  I can see the fucking things  going up and down. 
[04:07:00]  Do you really think?  Dude, I took my headphones off.  Dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee, dee.  Dude, this show don't end  until you give that finger thing.  No.  I know you.  No.  Yeah, well, good.  And it's got his coat on.  The show's over.  And it has his coat on every day  all through the show.  It's like he's doing a radio show  in Alaska every day.  It's cold.  It's cold.  Yeah, but you don't have to wear  a puffy fucking North Face.  Yeah, I could have something in between.  Yeah, like a vest maybe.  You know, it's a pullover or something.  I don't know.  All right, look,  we're really off the air.  You're right.  You're not off the air, LP.  We're off the air.  You're not off the air. 
[04:07:30]  You're talking into the microphone  when you're off the air.  Look, I'm way back here.  Would I do this if we were still  Yes, you would.  Because you just like acting sexy.  Sexy.  I'm six feet away from the mic.  This would be very unprofessional.  No, it wouldn't.  We got a meeting to do.  That would be unprofessional.  Every time he does this, though,  he fucking uses the same improv.  We got a meeting.  You don't have a fucking meeting.  We actually do.  What's the meeting people?  Who's that?  See, now you're buying it  because you got the head.  See, the people are leaving.  I'm telling you,  the show's over.  How's this shit? 
[04:08:00]  What's up, dude?  We do have a meeting.  I know.  See you guys later.  You really thought we were still on?  You're on the air.  Whatever.  I know you're on the air  because the instant feedback's still going.  That goes all night.  It does not go all night.  I swear to God,  this goes all night.  I don't even know how to get it.  I swear to God.  I just dropped that GT.  I see you guys later.  Are we meeting people in?  Are we meeting in here  or somewhere else?  I think here.  What's your phone number again? 
[04:08:30]  Fine.  What is it?  What is it?  What'd you say?  I need your phone number again.  All right.  What is it?  Hold on.  5-1...  Shut up.  I'll tell you.  Fucking douchebag.  6-4-6.  7.  That's not the number.  It's 5-1-6.  No.  9-1-7.  6.  You want to play?  No, I don't.  7. 
[04:09:00]  I hope he's like this.  I hope he goes,  you want to play?  No, not actually.  You have a trio, right?  So it's 9-1-7.  Yo.  7.  I'll buck around.  You're more famous than me.  Oh, man.  Is there a 9 in it?  Oh, it's phone roulette.  That's funny, dude.  I guess I'll take a shit.  No, we're really off the air.  This is fucking good.  Nice talking to you. 
[04:09:30]  Wow.  You think this is going to make you lose ratings?  Ratings?  Oh, this is XM.  You don't get that.  Ratings over here.  It's pure listening pleasure.  Bobby, would I walk out if we were still on the air?  Yeah.  No, I wouldn't.  Yeah, you would.  You'd get high-pitched.  You'd get high-pitched when you're locked.  All the lights are off.  Look.  All of them are...  They're in, like, computer mode.  What are they in, man?  Computer mode.  All right, man.  I'll see you later, bro.  I'm going to put Muggsy in this stove. 
[04:10:00]  That's it.  I'll just...  Look at all the fans.  We do a meeting.  All the shitty acting the fans are doing right now because we're still on.  Look at them.  Look at them.  They can't hold their fucking expressions in.  Are we still on the air?  It's not a fan.  It's E-Rock.  E-Rock has the worst fucking acting face ever.  The fan, he's like a freaking poker player.  Look at you.  I can still hear it.  I can still hear it.  You can hear it out there, dude.  Bobby. 
[04:10:30]  Big red on-air sign.  Bobby, you're a homo.  Like, fucking WKRP in Cincinnati.  Fuck you, Opie.  Go fuck yourself.  You're a homo.  Looks up and sees on the air.  He's a homo.  That's a lighting problem is what that is.  It's a lighting problem.  No, Bobby just left.  Bobby's a homo.  This is what you can do when they don't have their headphones on.  It really is a budget.  Bobby's a homo.  Yeah.  We've got to meet him.  For what?  Bobby's a homo.  Of what? 
[04:11:00]  I can't say.  Hey, Bobby, you're a homo.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Bobby, you wanted to spank that kid.  You're a homo.  You're a homo.  Look at Opie.  You're such a homo.  You're a homo, too, homo.  You're calling you a homo.  You want to spank that kid.  Look at his fucking red hair.  I hope he has red hair.  That's not that red.  It gets red in the wintertime.  He's got...  Look at the beautiful highlighted hair he has.  I don't highlight my hair. 
[04:11:30]  You don't?  At least I didn't almost spank a guy today.  That was a fucking shame.  All right.  We're off the air now.  Seriously.  This is getting stupid.  All right.  Take it easy.  Yeah.  All right.  Bye.  We'll stay after this.  That's it.  Good job, Bobby.  Thanks.  There goes Bobby.  All right.  What's this?  Give the finger.  What?  I've got to grab my scarf. 
[04:12:00]  Just go home.  We've got a meeting.  It's easy.  Get out of here.  You really thought we were on that whole time.  You're crazy.  There's a dumb sign right there.  What?  Right there.  That's always lit.  No, it's not.  You said that last time, you homo.  I swear to God, it's always lit.  Oh, fuck off.  I'm out of here.  I don't give a shit.  Where's my phone?  See you later, buddy.  9-1-7.  7-0.  7?  Yeah. 
[04:12:30]  2?  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  It's a great game.  It really is.  Hey, hey!  Wow.  Wow.  I'm just going to text you, a fucking friendly reminder.  All right.  A friendly reminder.  See you in Vegas, all right, Bob?  Jesus, Kenny.  Kenny just scared Bobby.  He really did.  He's got fucking baggy Levi's on.  Standing in the door.  Bob, it was great today.  Thanks, buddy.  See you later.  See you later.  I did it, Bob. 
[04:13:00]  Take it easy again.  Good job.  Be good.  He's not, uh...  There we go.  Want to do a prison visit?  No.  It's kind of awkward because we started this bed and there's no way to do it now.  There's no way to really end it?  Hey, just point or something.  Just point?  Yeah.  Okay, I'll point.  Let's see.  Okay, we'll, um...  See you tomorrow.  Wait, was he supposed to... 
[04:13:30]  Onions.  Why does my crotch smell like onions?  I don't remember eating onions.  Did I sit in onions?  Did I sit in onions?  Opie and Anthony. </pre>
