<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony "After ONA Live" broadcast featured a chaotic mix of segments, beginning with a discussion about a female guest from an earlier show.  The hosts, including Opie, Anthony (implied by the show title), Sam Roberts, and Danny, engaged in vulgar boasting and attempts to impress her, with Opie's approach subtly different from the others'.  This transitioned into Opie detailing his upcoming video projects, particularly a ghost-hunting trip with Bob Kelly and Jack Vaughn, which he discussed alongside his delayed new camera purchase due to B&H Photo's Passover closure.  The conversation was frequently interrupted by the usual inter-staff conflict and banter between Opie, Anthony, Sam Roberts, Danny, Jim Norton, E-Rock, Roland, and Kenny.  E-Rock notably "fought back" against the constant ribbing, while Kenny's absence and perceived lack of preparedness, coupled with his social media activity, were also commented on.  A significant portion of the broadcast included playing audio of Jim Norton's emotional reaction, including tears, to a segment about Roger Ebert's cancer recovery, sparking discussion about Norton's emotional vulnerability, particularly in the mornings.  The hosts' reactions ranged from empathy to teasing.  Sam Roberts and Roland then recounted their disastrous Tribeca Film Festival red carpet experience, detailing their failed attempts at celebrity interviews and contrasting their efforts with a rival reporting team, "City Buzz," with audio from the red carpet included.  The broadcast concluded with a mysterious, unresolved cliffhanger from engineer Mars, teasing an unidentified staff member.  The entire show maintained its characteristically crude humor, frequent interruptions, and informal, chaotic atmosphere.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Where's everybody going?  Sam Roberts.  Danny.  You got anywhere with Danielle?  Did I?  Yeah, I saw you trying.  I didn't really try, it was more like...  You were trying a little.  I liked your approach, though.  Hold on, I liked your approach, because you... 
[00:00:30]  Oh, Opie's still here!  I had just as much as he had.  I had just as much.  Hey, I'm living on Long Island, too.  He's got a bigger house than you.  Yeah, well, yeah, that he's got.  But, hey, I got two bedrooms.  He has an actual house.  Hold on, your approach was good, Danny, because everyone else, including myself, we all sounded  really desperate, and you just sat back and just kind of threw it in at the end.  Like, I'm the cool one.  Yeah.  I don't need to prove anything.  I'm a cool guy.  Well, I mean, if we're all going to throw our dicks around, I'll just say, hey, I got a  house on Long Island.  I might as well throw my hat in the ring on this one, too.  You don't own a house. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, but I read it.  It's good enough, though.  Yeah.  And I still put money.  Well, I give someone money to have it.  It's part of a house.  That's like...  No, it's a house.  It's like a two-family house.  No.  How many families?  I'm just one person.  How many families live in your house?  We're all single people.  We're all single people.  Well, I think...  I think...  I couldn't tell, but I think she's probably giving you the eyes the most in the room.  Well, I'm the shortest.  I'm the shortest.  So I think I fit together with her physically better than the rest of the guys. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, and she's like, I need somebody who's taller than me, but not that much taller than  me.  Yeah.  Because the other guys, she's probably like too tall.  Yeah, because when you try to have relations with someone who's too far past your own height,  it gets uncomfortable.  So she probably is looking for a guy of a smaller stature to...  What was the quote?  Squeeze, come out?  Oh, that was off the air.  I'm sorry.  I said she was squeeze, to come out of you.  And then Jimmy pumped it up with some kind of elephants sitting on toothpaste.  Opie, did you...  Was it your goal?  Like, I saw that you saw the interview was going well. 
[00:02:00]  She was having a good time.  Was it your goal to say, okay, how far can I push this to make it uncomfortable?  No, I thought I was trying to make everyone comfortable.  With the tweets.  The tweets were like a little like, oh, let me read one more.  I'll eat sushi off your sushi.  She just said she didn't even like it.  I thought she would appreciate a few compliments from the listeners.  Well, the listeners are vulgar people.  Well, no.  And she's a lady.  Then I stopped because then they were trying too hard.  Those were the ones that came in before anyone was trying to be shocking.  I also told Jim that my new favorite Jim character is a creepy guy who's pretending not to be creepy. 
[00:02:30]  Did you notice he was doing that every time?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was great.  Every time you mention it, he said, yeah, I wouldn't lift your skirt up unless you'd want me to, you know.  Did you see the tattoo?  Yeah, so, I mean, I'm the one who wrote the one sheet with the tattoo information on it.  I think I might have got a good video today.  I came out of retirement to make a video today.  I was talking, I've talked to Ron about how you guys don't use the show prep that you have.  No.  And I just love that Jim was sitting there guessing her Twitter name as opposed to looking at the sheet that I wrote. 
[00:03:00]  It was right there.  After I got home from stupid Tribeca last night.  It was certainly right there, but, yeah, I'm waiting for my new camera to come in,  so I don't really want to make any more videos until it comes in.  I've been hearing rumors.  But I broke out the flip just to make a video for screaming.  Well, I mean, you talk about a good last hurrah.  No, we want it real life.  Yeah, I see.  No, I'm not sharing now.  Fuck that.  Well, it's the radio.  I mean, you can share.  It's just the audio.  It's not like people are going to be like, I heard the...  It was on the radio already. 
[00:03:30]  I'm not sharing my fucking video.  We could play the clip.  Fuck you.  I'm not trying to see.  But I have heard rumors.  About what?  That there's a new Opie's Eye video camera in the works.  Well, yeah, because I wrote a few things, a few short stories.  Some skits?  Oh, did you?  Yeah, I did, actually.  Are they skits or are they short films?  It's going to be better than fucking wandering around Manhattan hoping a homeless guy shits.  I'm trying to take it to the next level, Sam.  Is that your goal?  You wake up on a Saturday thinking, oh, maybe a homeless guy will shit. 
[00:04:00]  I better go walk around.  Look, I know what I am.  I walk around hoping a homeless guy shit, and then I put it on a YouTube channel and look at the hits, hoping I get 10,000 out of it.  Yeah, look.  This homeless guy is shitting.  But I finally said, you know what?  Maybe I got some things in his brain that I could film for real.  So I'm getting a kick-ass camera, but the stupid jah.  The jah?  I don't know anything about it.  I call them the stupid jahs because they have this great camera and video shop near Penn Station called B&H Photo and Video. 
[00:04:30]  They are all Jewish people.  But the damn jahs, they actually shut down their store until next Wednesday.  For Passover.  Who has a business where they go, you know what?  I'm just going to shut down for a week out of nowhere.  They have always been egotistically Jewish.  I mean, they will not put their business open.  And they are that sure of themselves.  And I refuse to buy it from anyone else, especially like a Best Buy or something.  So now I have to wait for the jah to unlock the store again. 
[00:05:00]  Which is next week.  Now that you know what camera to buy, why don't you just buy it from someplace else?  I was thinking that.  Just get it on Amazon.  Probably get it cheaper.  But they're so cool down there that I figured, you know what?  The guy sat with me for like an hour, giving me the ins and outs.  So he's a sucker.  Actually, he didn't want to even fucking help me until I told him where I was.  So, I mean, he's using you.  He's trying to get some plugs, which you just gave him.  He's gotten his money's worth.  He does have a website that he's really hoping I talk about on the show.  Apart from B&H, his own thing. 
[00:05:30]  So you're kind of right.  He's a young filmmaker himself.  He's not getting any plugs for that website.  But the concept is pretty good.  And I haven't decided if we should talk about it on our show yet.  No, just steal it.  If he gives me the camera for free, then it's fine.  Is it a nice, expensive camera?  Oh, that'll make it sound like it's the next fucking YouTube, this thing he's got going.  See, if you pick up two, you get one for me.  And then we'll do a two-camera shoot.  Yeah, good luck with that, Sam.  Are you going to have actors in these stories that you've written?  Well, the one that we're definitely filming that I didn't actually. 
[00:06:00]  It's more of a concept.  Yeah.  But me and Bob Kelly are going ghost hunting.  I like that.  I'm serious.  It's a good idea.  You know that Kings Park psych ward photo that I tweeted over the weekend?  Yeah.  We are going to wander around and go ghost hunting.  And I wrote him yesterday about it, Bob Kelly.  He's so excited.  It's a great idea.  It's going to be hilarious.  Wait, let me find the text message.  God, you're getting some inside shit today, huh?  Well, I'm good.  This is amazing.  I'm good with interviews.  I bring down people's guards. 
[00:06:30]  We're like little kids, me and Bob Kelly, when we get an idea.  It's kind of like the fly fishing thing.  Okay.  Oh, okay.  I write.  Also, you and me are going ghost hunting at the closed psych ward on Long Island.  He writes, fuck, I'm in.  We need the right gear.  That's what I was just about to say.  You do need the right gear.  And stay with me on this.  We're going to stay topical.  We're going to stay to what the kids are talking about on the internet right now.  Yeah.  Jumpsuits.  Yeah.  Proton packs.  Yeah.  Ghostbusters.  Yeah.  I'm thinking we'll have some fun and we'll goof around and maybe I'll get some good video. 
[00:07:00]  No, no, no, no, no.  He's like, yeah, we need the right gear.  So now he's thinking as he prepares for his Foxwoods, Foxwoods show.  Yeah.  I think starting tonight, right?  He's actually writing me and trying to figure out what gear we need for our big ghost hunting trip.  Well, Bob Kelly always takes things to the next level.  I mean, you saw the way he took to fly fishing.  Of course he's going to say, if now he's going to be a ghost hunter, he's going to be the best goddamn ghost hunter there ever was.  And then, of course, I write, I knew I could count on you. 
[00:07:30]  Who else do you want to invite?  Because it's our little field trip.  You're starting your own ghost hunters club.  And then he writes, Jack Vaughn, Comedy Central.  He's a skeptic.  Doesn't believe at all.  Perfect.  So he wants a guy that doesn't believe at all.  So when we really find a ghost, then the guy goes, holy shit.  But the three of you are going to have to sit down and storyboard this thing first.  Because you can't have a stranger walking around.  No, this is one of my, like, I like to call it real life.  I don't storyboard real life.  You don't even have a little meeting? 
[00:08:00]  No, I just go with it.  And we'll see what we get.  It's like this show.  Not this show.  The show that's done before.  Your show.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, this show is different.  Did we do any of the prep today?  You?  Yeah.  Well, you did my...  No, I prep for the show.  I mean, if you want to make jokes, that's fine.  But I prep for the show.  I'm talking about the prep you and the gang put in front of us today.  You did a couple of things today?  You did the Tribeca interviews.  Yes.  You did not read the Daniel.  Why?  What?  Dr. Steve said it was genius, and he is a doctor.  What? 
[00:08:30]  I didn't say anything.  You just said, God, I wish I didn't.  I didn't say anything.  E-Rock, are you wearing headphones?  Yes, sir.  Did you hear him just say, God, I wish I didn't?  Yes, I did.  Okay, see?  More fat jokes for you tomorrow.  Oh, jeez, Eric.  It's like it's my fault.  It just goes like it's my fault.  Listen, Bob Kelly called in a special...  My favorite part of the show today?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  E-Rock finally fucking fighting back, and I even was fist pumping, like, keep going,  asshole.  And you stopped, but you called out Sam.  Well, so, yeah.  It's about time you fight back.  Maybe you can fight back at some of the other guys, too. 
[00:09:00]  That was my favorite part of the show today.  Why?  When he was...  Listening to you guys kind of like...  Bicker?  Bicker.  Yes.  Oh, Kenny, look.  Look at...  On 48th Street.  Are you walking today?  Hey...  Tell him no.  Sit down there and wait.  I'm doing radio still.  You're listening to this, aren't you?  He better be.  It's his job.  Oh, you want me to answer him through the radio?  Oh.  Let me see what the temperature is.  Hold on there, Sam.  Kenny's supposed to be calling in with weather and traffic.  He should be telling you what the temperature is.  51 degrees.  Do I walk?  That's a little iffy.  I don't have...  I mean, it's a little brisk, but you have a sweatshirt on.  Can I use the radio to talk to Kenny? 
[00:09:30]  Kenny, how cold does it feel outside?  And now he'll text me back.  But how long of a delay are we on?  Oh, like a while.  28 seconds.  Why wouldn't he call in?  He doesn't want to do your show.  He told me.  He's done.  He did it yesterday.  And you know what Kenny does every morning when he picks me up?  What?  And I caught him this morning.  As I'm opening the door, this is what I hear.  Really loud pop music for a split second as he's changing the dial to a news channel  so I can prepare for the radio show. 
[00:10:00]  Because he listens...  He listens to you.  I knew it.  And I go, how's Sam doing on that Hits 1 or whatever the fuck that channel is?  And he goes, he doesn't talk enough.  Kenny, is it cold out?  No, it's a beautiful day in New York City, GH.  Is Jimmy in the car?  No, I don't know where he is.  I just saw him walk down the hallway.  Yeah, you got to wait for Jimmy.  I'll come with you.  I don't need to do this horse shit show.  I'll be right there.  Kenny, what's the traffic report? 
[00:10:30]  What's the difference?  Well, you were supposed to give me the traffic.  I don't know yet.  I don't talk at the camera.  All right, I'll learn.  All right, information boat?  Yeah.  This show's going nowhere, so I'll leave now.  That's not true.  What?  That's not true.  This show is going nowhere but up.  With the end of your sentence.  Tony Kenny on Facebook.  He's done.  He's out.  You hung up on that.  Yeah, I did.  He just calls up and plugs his Facebook.  He loves his Facebook.  Oh, he plugs his and Troy's Facebook all day. 
[00:11:00]  Nobody just knows who Troy is.  And he's squeezing into my Facebook life.  Kenny is?  Yeah, he comments on all my photos saying how terrific it is.  And I'm thinking, that's not why he's doing that.  He wants people to realize that he has a Facebook page.  Exactly.  I'm starting to learn this Facebook world.  Listen, when you sign up for Facebook and say, this is my new Facebook, I left a thing  on your wall that said, welcome to Facebook.  Yeah.  I could have just texted you.  That was just so people knew I was on Facebook.  I know.  At least you're being honest about it.  I'm always honest.  What's my Facebook?  Facebook.com slash OB Radio Fans. 
[00:11:30]  Nice.  And did you hear the YouTube and Twitter plugs I was giving you yesterday?  No.  I talked about the, you retweeted on this show.  I don't listen to this show.  Well, you should.  It's a great show.  Why is it a great show?  Because I am electric.  Roland, what do you got going on?  Oh, not too much.  I talked about the Bob Kelly jizz tree videos that you retweeted, and then I played the bit.  Oh, thank you.  And then I played the bit.  All right, that's a good show.  Look at the incorporation that's going into this.  Thank you, Sam.  I appreciate it.  Can I go now?  Well, I was also going to tell you that Bob Kelly called in a special delivery last Saturday, 
[00:12:00]  and he said that when Cheap becomes a full movie, he'll be looking at me for a possible  role in the movie.  So, you know.  As a rape victim, though.  Well, I don't know what the role is yet, Roland.  What are we doing?  He's going to put me in his movie.  While you're writing your short stories, keep in mind, I'm very camera friendly.  But I don't know if I have anything for you.  I'm very...  I mean, we could film your suicide.  I'm not going to commit suicide.  Why?  I've got too much to live for.  Opie, I did use your time bit yesterday. 
[00:12:30]  It worked perfectly.  Oh, my God.  You should have seen Roland.  You know what?  That's not my bit.  Now that you brought it to the air, I've got to be honest.  That's a Club Soda County slash dice bit that we do.  It screams Club Soda County dice.  And where did you do it?  Right outside of Rub.  Yeah, downtown.  Cool.  Can we film it today?  Oh, wait.  I'm in retirement.  Never mind.  Oh, wait.  I could come out of retirement for that.  Again?  That's too...  We're out of retirement.  Well, because that's like...  That type of nonsense is an HD flip video.  You retire worse than Jay-Z right now. 
[00:13:00]  True.  You're retired until the Canon camera.  What time?  What time we wander around doing nothing.  You're supposed to be retired.  Whenever.  Roland, you're supposed to be working.  What do you mean whenever?  You're supposed to be...  He's the boss.  He's the boss.  I'm not no fucking boss.  You are the boss.  Your name's on the wall.  Now you got me mad.  Because I called you the boss?  Bruce Springsteen doesn't walk out.  Does he, Roland?  No.  Oh, he's really walking out.  Opie's leaving.  Oh, shit.  The on-air light just shook.  Sam, why'd you smile? 
[00:13:30]  Because that's your show again?  That's right.  We got him out of here.  E-Rock, we got him out of here.  All right.  E-Rock, you're all pissed at Opie today.  No, not really.  Well.  Who are you pissed at?  Me?  I'm not pissed at anybody.  Then what are you so sullen for?  Because it's been a shitty morning.  For who?  For me.  Whoa.  Somebody's loud for not being pissed.  Not at you.  Somebody said that some of the general towels still upset his tummy.  Yeah, E-Rock, you throw up more than anyone I know.  Why do you get sick so much?  No.  The last time I threw up, I was... 
[00:14:00]  You're a confused model.  You're supposed to throw up before you eat and after.  Oh.  No, actually, you're supposed to throw up after.  Oh, shit.  Why would they be throwing up?  That's why you're not a bulimic.  Last time I threw up, I was legitimately sick.  Today just happened out of nowhere from the food we ate.  You throw up a lot.  E-Rock, we actually...  We should...  I would play a Bob Kelly bit, speaking of throwing up, but we did that yesterday.  Yeah.  We can't play Bob Kelly throwing up every day.  What I do want to play, though, is Jim went through an emotional... 
[00:14:30]  What's Mars doing out there?  Nothing.  Roland, can you go ask Mars what he's laughing at?  You want to do the Jim bit?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Oh, because you were talking BHM and the Jews and stuff.  I thought you might want to do the other one.  Do you think it's...  Is it funnier than the Jim thing?  Well, they're both good.  But if you want to do Jim, we'll do Jim.  Roland, go ask Mars real quick why he's looking in the studio and laughing.  Because I would like to talk to him if there's something to talk about.  I would like to find out what's going on.  Mars.  Mars.  Why are you laughing?  What's so funny?  What's so funny? 
[00:15:00]  Don't you have a radio show here?  Yeah, but I want to know what's so...  This is the show.  What's so funny?  I saw you in the hallway.  You're the engineer.  And you're laughing.  I want to know, what did I miss?  I'm speaking to my boss there.  But what did I miss?  I don't like it.  If there's a funny joke, I don't know about it.  He'd say, can't you fix your computer?  And they all laughed.  Oh, that's not nice.  I can't.  Ah, don't hit me.  Did I miss a funny joke?  You were laughing right outside the studio.  I want to know what's happening.  It's a good one.  What was it?  Nah, I don't know. 
[00:15:30]  Who was it about?  Who was it about?  Who do you think?  Somebody who works in this studio?  Yes.  One of the hosts?  He wants to be.  Uh-oh.  One of the staff members.  Who are you talking about?  I'm not.  You said he wants to be a host.  Of course.  It's not Opie Anthony Jim.  Those are the hosts.  It's Opie Anthony wannabe.  Oh, shit.  Who works on this channel?  Yes.  Oh, shit.  I'm out.  Talk to you guys later.  Oh, my God.  What a cliffhanger.  We're going to follow this story, okay, Mars? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  This is not the last time we're talking about this, because I want to know who Mars was talking about.  I hope he wasn't talking about me.  Who do you think he was talking about, Roland?  I don't know.  Then why would you have your hand up?  My back itched.  Well, Roland, you work on that.  You know what?  We haven't.  Yeah, do the Jim thing.  Jim was crying today.  He was talking about.  What are you sighing at?  Sorry.  I didn't know the mic was on.  Reception's transferring.  Listener calls into the studio. 
[00:16:30]  But what do?  Some guy is on the hold here on the internal phone talking about Tom from earlier.  Yeah.  And I'll go, who is this?  And he's demanding to know who I am, so I'm demanding to know who he is.  He's like, I got information on Tom.  I said, good.  And he's just sitting here on hold.  This is insane.  This is the second call I got in the last five minutes.  Well, we should get into a little O&A material on this show.  As I said earlier, though, we are kind of dwindling that down, aren't we, E-Rock?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, yeah, Jim was crying about his dream this morning. 
[00:17:00]  He had a dream that I guess he was in a coma for 30 years and had lost so much of his life.  Oh, Jim Norton is sending in a request via text saying, get that, well, get Mars off the radio.  We'll just put it that way.  He can get away with more than I can get away with at this point.  That was for you, Jim, a request to Jim Norton.  Speaking to Jim Norton, he was crying his dream that he had missed 30 years of his life and so much had passed him by. 
[00:17:30]  He gets emotional in the mornings.  And one morning, at this point, over a year ago, he was crying over Roger Ebert.  Roger Ebert was on Oprah.  It was the first time he had been seen since his reconstructive jaw surgery, whatever was going on.  And while we were playing clips and making fun of Roger Ebert, which is what we would normally do, Norton started crying.  Where did we pick this up, E-Rock?  It picks up about a minute before he starts crying.  And then we get some post-whatever? 
[00:18:00]  Oh, yeah, it's all post.  Okay.  It's Norton crying over Roger Ebert.  He's emotional in the mornings.  Right here.  I just got another text.  What did I say?  I'm not going to tell you, but I'm not even going to tell you anything.  Here's Jim crying on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  Oprah Winfrey had Roger Ebert.  Roger Ebert.  Yesterday, yes.  We'll be right back with Roger's...  Roger Ebert and his wife of 18 years, Chaz. 
[00:18:30]  And almost four years ago, Roger lost his voice.  And he also lost his ability to eat and his ability to drink due to complications from thyroid cancer.  And today, he is cancer-free!  All right.  Great.  And they're both praying, so...  That's like losing your legs and saying he can't get athlete's foot.  But he is also working at a cutting-edge technology company in Scotland... 
[00:19:00]  This is really, really cool.  ...to help him use his actual voice.  And we were with him as he tested out the new software.  Look at this.  This is amazing.  I haven't heard his voice since July 1st, 2006.  And I hope and I pray that it's everything you want it to be.  See, it's the turtle.  It won't be me, but it will cheer him up.  Okay.  All right.  You'll know it's a computer, but one that sounds like me. 
[00:19:30]  A company in Scotland is using hours of Roger's past movie commentaries...  Oh, my God.  ...to speak again in his own voice.  Want to hear the new voice?  Okay.  This is the first version of my computer voice.  It's what they call the beta.  It still needs improvement, but at least it sounds like me.  When I type anything, this voice will speak whatever I type. 
[00:20:00]  When I read something, it will read in my voice.  But I have got to say, in first grade, they said I talk too much.  And now I still can.  Oh.  Well, that's pretty amazing, though, you know?  Isn't that amazing technology?  But it's just because of the job he had.  Like, who goes around recording everything you say?  Exactly.  You know, it just so happened he had said a lot of shit over the years.  Yeah, they're giving hope to other people that, well, there's no audio of them anywhere. 
[00:20:30]  You got, like, fucking a few minutes on your answering machine.  That's all you can use.  Leave a message after the beep.  That's all you can say.  Yeah, but Roger's lucky.  He has, what, hundreds and hundreds and thousands of hours of...  Yeah.  You all right?  I was miserable.  I had to leave.  What happened?  Oh, Jimmy.  Did you get upset?  About what?  Jimmy.  Jimmy's crying.  He's just upset about the whole Roger Ebert thing.  Really? 
[00:21:00]  Oh, that's...  Jeez.  Jimmy's emotional today.  Oh, my God.  It's Jimmy Fez.  Wait, is this real?  Yeah.  I never know with you.  No, he can't act this good.  I've seen him.  Jimmy's eyes are completely red, and he's tearing up.  It's upsetting.  It is upsetting.  What got to you?  I didn't know why you left.  I'm like, what happened to Jimmy?  I thought I was done. 
[00:21:30]  Wow.  Early in the morning, I'm really bad with this shit.  I can't do it.  Really?  Yeah.  With me, it's when I leave the show.  I get in that truck, and I'm just a wreck.  Like, the horrible stuff?  Yeah.  I'm fucking...  Like, the first two hours I'm awake, if I ever have to do, like, sad shit...  Like, uh...  I mean, I'm fine.  It's just that I'm like this early in the morning.  I can't...  I've never seen you like this.  In all these years.  Do you want to talk about it? 
[00:22:00]  Gee, emotion on this show?  Fuck.  Who sees this?  Wow.  What got to you?  What got to...  No, I mean, obviously, this is pretty tough stuff, but I want to know what was the thing  that just set him off.  I don't know.  Please don't say my horrible joke.  No, your joke was fucking beautiful.  Yeah, you were laughing at Anthony's joke.  I had a tough time watching this yesterday, too.  And I was thinking to myself, how are we even going to handle this on our show? 
[00:22:30]  Because obviously, the jokes are going to come.  You have to, in a way.  But also, you just think of what this guy went through, and I can't even imagine.  Do you share an agent or something?  I heard he liked Lucky Lou.  He was going to talk about it.  I've never seen Jimmy like this.  I don't know what he's about to do.  No, I don't mean to make it awkward.  That's why I just left.  Because it was just like, oh, fuck.  Wow.  I can't handle stuff early.  Yeah.  Early, huh?  The first, yeah, the first couple hours I'm up. 
[00:23:00]  It's just a.  I'm like a fucking.  After a certain time, I'm like, I'm really weird the first couple hours I'm awake.  I've always been like that.  Like, I'm emotionally, I'm like fucking weird.  Right.  I guess we never.  Have we never hit on like a really.  This is a sad stuff.  I mean, obviously, you remember the guy the way he was and all this shit.  We've hit on some stuff like this.  In the morning, yeah.  What do you think?  The freaking lady that got her face ripped off by the monkey.  That's just as bad as this.  Well, I don't think it's as personal. 
[00:23:30]  We didn't.  We weren't personally invested in that woman.  Oh, so you just remember.  This is kind of like.  We kind of grew up.  We grew up watching.  Sister and Ebert.  And to see him like that is a little.  Yeah.  People are saying, bravo, Jimmy.  I'm telling you, I've known Jimmy a really long time.  I wasn't sure at first because I've never seen this from Jimmy before.  Steve from Bayshore.  He's not thinking it.  Jimmy feels terrible for any person else to live without a chin.  No, I don't object to making fun of it.  I really don't.  I just, I'm not saying that. 
[00:24:00]  I'm not trying to be.  Well, we.  Yeah, but we're also.  We're also looking at this in amazement because.  Did he hear his computer voice?  It was awful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What he said to it.  It was like.  Yeah.  I don't even know what to do.  No, it's just, you know.  It's sad.  I'm sad that Jimmy's sad.  Like, I don't care about fucking.  I don't care about Roger Ebert.  I'm just sad.  Jimmy's sad.  I think we should all just have a good cry. 
[00:24:30]  It makes me sad.  It was just the whole thing, Jimmy?  Or when you're just thinking of how he used to be?  Or.  Could not be able to speak.  This is a new tech to get chicks.  I swear to fucking God.  No, listen.  Red eyes never get your pussy.  No?  Kiss on the head.  Yeah.  Kiss on the head.  It's not sexy.  Exactly.  Okay.  You could see a bloke job.  Oh, wait a minute.  Kiss on the turtle next.  Kenny happened to come in and then all of a sudden you left.  So I'm like, all right, maybe Kenny had to ask you something.  No, no, no, no.  And I saw you marching down the hall. 
[00:25:00]  I'm like, what the hell happened?  No, because Oprah's a good interviewer where she asked him what was the last thing he ever  said.  It was like, oh.  That was it.  Yeah, you kind of, when you start thinking about like what that could be.  His A&W dream was like, oh, fuck this.  I'm going to go sit on the toilet.  And then it passed and I was like, all right, fine.  I know how I am in the morning.  I'm like, fucking, I'm fucked up.  I'm like, yeah.  A little.  Oh, yeah.  I'm awful.  More emotional in the morning.  I mean, literally, yeah, a lot more.  What is that?  What time does it kick in that you can be a complete stomach? 
[00:25:30]  I don't know.  I don't know.  But like, a lot of times I'm driving in, coming to the show, listening to music.  If it's sand, I'll cry.  I mean, I'm weird.  We never knew this.  No.  We've been with you for fucking 10 years.  All those years.  I always thought he just got more jizz in his eyes.  Jacking off that.  Yeah, I've always been like that early.  Really early.  I'm like, fucking, you know.  And again, honestly, we've done more horrific stories than this.  Yeah, yeah.  We've made fun of a lot worse stuff than this.  This is on par with a lot of things we've done in the past.  That's why I got really confused.  It was literally 10 after 6.  It's, you know, and he's saying that he had an A&W root beer dream of his father. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a little fucking harsh.  I think everyone wakes up a little vulnerable.  I feel like vulnerable when I first wake up.  And then you get mentally strong within like an hour or two.  And then you're good for the day.  And you walk around your house.  And you just feel very, very different.  But not to the extent of Jimmy.  That's what, what is this based on?  Does this go way back in your life?  No, just, oh, I don't know why that is.  I've always, I always thought I've ever had to do sad acting scenes. 
[00:26:30]  I'd have to do them early.  Like, if I ever did them early, I could probably win a fucking Oscar.  But I've always thought that.  Like, if I ever had to do any type of scene like that, very, very early for me would be fine.  I don't know why I'm like that, but I've always been able to, whatever.  Conjure up the emotion.  Yeah.  I just, oh, well, we got to, we got to do the rest of the audio.  I would never want you not to.  Oh, jeez.  But to not be able to talk, like, there's no greater curse.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a comic.  It's a radio.  Yeah, that's true, you know. 
[00:27:00]  To not be able to speak.  Look at what we do.  And then, and even what he did.  His whole fucking career was based around talking about the movies.  Wow, that's like a real fucking moment right there, ladies and gentlemen.  Wow, wow, wow.  It was the opie's joke about the goddamn director or the fucking guy.  That was a, that was one of the best jokes for the last six months.  That's what did it.  No, it's none of the making fun of it.  It's none of that that bothers me.  But you missed some good Steve C. fucking. 
[00:27:30]  Because one guy called in a Steve C. and said, well, I dream every night that I could see my feet.  You missed a really good one, Jimmy.  Yeah, no, no, that's not about, there wasn't an objection to it.  It was just like, oh, man, I had to go sit on the toilet for a bit.  You got your hair cut, too.  I did it the other day after my audition yesterday.  Maybe it's like Samson.  Yeah.  Delilah.  I'm trying to throw a fag with my hair gone.  Fucking woman.  Like some grandmother.  Where's Brando when you need him?  Slap my fucking face. 
[00:28:00]  I felt like I was looking at a little kid when Jimmy came back in.  I thought I was going to have to hug him or something.  It was.  No, I was fine.  And then after a couple of minutes, when I came back in, I was like, oh, fuck.  It's still like, because it was fine that I came back in.  I didn't care.  People know.  I'm not ashamed or like, oh, my God.  I feel terrible.  I could care less.  I like that type of thing.  I like real shit.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  We're going to have to beat you up for a little bit.  But I love real shit.  The more you can smash me all you want. 
[00:28:30]  I deserve it.  I ran off and sat on the toilet like a fucking chick.  Like a chick.  Fucking.  No.  Well, I don't think anyone would do that to you, Jimmy.  I hope not.  I hope the guys wouldn't give me a ribbing.  Hey, Chris in East Meadow.  What's up?  Yeah, I want to say to me, you're a fag.  You're a fag.  Oh, my God.  What an asshole.  I deserve it.  What shit is I talking?  Oh, God.  Every listener should just fucking dip their hand in something and smack my face. 
[00:29:00]  After ONA Live.  You see that?  Jim Norton is an emotional guy.  He's complex.  It's after Opie and Anthony Live.  And I'm Sam Roberts.  Opie is gone right now.  And Jim Norton has, thank God, stopped texting me.  Because the things that were said should never be said.  But Mars has disappeared.  I really would like to know what he was talking about.  I'm sure we will find out at some point.  Because he was talking about somebody on this staff.  And he was taking shots.  And I always want to know who's taking shots at who. 
[00:29:30]  Now, we played earlier on in today's show.  We played the clips of me and Roland down at the red carpet as the Ron and Fez crew sets up the studio.  Down at the red carpet in Tribeca at the premiere for Elton John's documentary that was starting the whole Tribeca Film Festival today.  And we talked about how we just stand there, we wait, and we get almost no guests.  Thank God I was able to worm my way into 10 seconds with Elton John to make it worthwhile. 
[00:30:00]  But we were standing next to these people who were there with City Buzz, I think was the name of it.  And it's just something that they put on the Internet and they air it in hotels and on JetBlue airplanes.  That's about where SiriusXM was positioned on this red carpet.  But, I mean, we get bored.  I mean, I ended up interviewing people that I didn't know who they were just because I had nothing else to do.  I got to talk to somebody.  And in the beginning, we were just watching the Olsen twins and Mayor Bloomberg Zoom by us. 
[00:30:30]  So there was nobody to talk to.  So, I mean, I turned on the microphone because I also wanted to monitor and share with you Roland's behavior.  I mean, these are people that he's meeting for the first time at an industry event.  And he's just acting like Roland always acts.  So I wanted to take you all behind the scenes with me as we look at what happens on the red carpet.  But I just turned the mic on and this is what happened at Tribeca.  Roland, we're here on the red carpet.  Are you having a good time? 
[00:31:00]  I'm having a blast.  We just talked to Mayor Bloomberg.  Oh, no, he ran by.  He ran by.  Because his little two fucking kids took up his time.  There are.  There's a couple of little...  I'm angry.  The kids?  Yeah, they took up his time.  They're like, what's your favorite city, Mr. Bloomberg?  There are.  There's a couple of kids reported.  We're not going to talk to anybody tonight with this kind of competition.  We're standing next to City Buzz.  City Buzz, how's your time so far at Tribeca?  Are you recording?  Yes, of course.  We're reporting. 
[00:31:30]  I've got to interview somebody on the red carpet.  I'm tired, sweetie.  I'm ready to go home.  Sam, we missed a big hit.  Hannibal.  Hannibal?  What's his name?  Hannibal.  We're in what is called the loser section of reporting on the red carpet.  What on earth is City Buzz?  Some bootleg website.  Well, I'd say it's got to be bootleg if you got stuck next to Sirius XM.  We have to air in JetBlue, so we are not that important.  And in hotels all throughout New York City.  You're in hotels? 
[00:32:00]  We air our content in hotels.  And planes?  And planes.  Why don't you get on, like, real TVs?  Well, you just met Roland for the first time tonight, City Buzz.  What do you think of Roland?  His name says Crew.  He doesn't get his own pass.  Well, what's your impression of Roland?  Oh, wait, you got a picture, though.  Fuck you.  Well, I'm a for-real reporter.  I'm just, you know.  What do you think of Roland?  He's funny.  You haven't been laughing.  It's been more like, what's he talking about? 
[00:32:30]  Like, just confused.  Like, why is he doing this?  He's comedy.  He'd be a good co-worker to have.  He's like that funny intern that you need to walk around the office.  Temporarily.  Very temporarily.  Like, three months, and then the semester's up.  Roland, your response?  Words hurt.  So, City Buzz, Roland told me he thinks we'll probably get Anne Hathaway and Steve Martin tonight.  What do you think?  How is David all the way down there?  Who's David?  I used to work with him.  Where does he work for now?  I don't know.  I need to find out.  Not City Buzz.  Let me text his ass.  Who's coming?  Who'd that lady just say was coming? 
[00:33:00]  He's with MTV The Seven.  What the fuck is MTV The Seven?  It's on MTV.  That's on TV.  It's on hotels, planes, and televisions.  Jerry.  What'd I miss?  I used to work at Jerry Springer and I quit.  What for?  Because I hated it.  And I texted this guy about his advice.  How come you hated Jerry Springer?  It was ghetto.  I can't multitask.  I'm trying to text.  Wait.  Why are there no people on this red carpet?  At least I got something for the 10 o'clock hour. 
[00:33:30]  I don't know what you got right now.  You think we're still going to go to Anne Hathaway and Steve Martin?  Yeah.  We're running by our asses.  That's just some of the magic that goes on at these red carpet events.  I don't know where Roland is.  He was just in here a minute ago.  But can you believe the flavor that City Buzz has?  Did you hear that sass?  E-Rock.  Yes, sir.  Are you upset that you didn't go to Tribeca red carpet?  Not at all.  You aren't upset that you didn't get to see Sir Elton?  I would have loved to see Sir Elton, but not in that scenario, no. 
[00:34:00]  Did you hear the type of whimsical banter?  I was just making fun of City Buzz for the entire time.  I got to understand.  What the fuck was the point with this whole red carpet?  Throughout the show, I'm watching the TVs in the studio here, Channel 5 and Channel 11.  None of these people got any interviews.  They took shots of them against the background there.  Yeah.  But then they went in.  Nobody got anything.  So what was the point of having a red carpet?  Everybody goes insane at all of these red carpets.  And of all the red carpets I've been to, I've never understood why anybody goes to any of them. 
[00:34:30]  I mean, I go because I get asked to go, and then I just go and see if I can do something funny.  But everybody goes to these events and seriously reports they're all trying to get exclusives.  But like I told the City Buzz people, why don't you just have MSNBC come and tape for everybody?  Why don't you just have one guy tape and send out the tapes?  No, because they all have to put their little stamp on it saying that we got it.  That's what it is.  The girl who was just over there, you know, sassing and frassing, said, well, no, because then we wouldn't get our mic flags in the shot. 
[00:35:00]  Who cares?  What difference does it make?  Like, if everybody is there filming it, then isn't nobody really there filming it?  Compare it to, like, say, a major court trial when the verdict's going to be read.  It's all through a universal feed when the president goes up at the podium to give a speech and says something controversial or something newsworthy.  It's all through a universal feed.  But then they all say, no, this is a Fox exclusive or NBC exclusive. 
[00:35:30]  You all got the same shit.  Just go to the red carpets.  Because they're not going to do many interviews, so have three people there interviewing, bring one video camera, one still camera, and you've got what you're getting.  Did you get any photos?  Roland took pictures of me while I was interviewing.  Elton John?  Yes.  That is a major get.  Yes.  I mean, it's kind of like, it's not like a posed picture of me and him.  It does not matter.  That is a major get, and I am envious of you.  I hope so.  I'll put it up on Twitter later to share it with everybody, and then, you know, we'll produce the whole thing. 
[00:36:00]  But I'm very excited because hopefully tomorrow, you know, we were talking before on this show about getting a call.  You were getting calls in that room from listeners that reception was putting through.  Hopefully tomorrow we will have the major update on Is Tom Alive?  Yeah.  You know, Tom from White Plains from Is Tom Alive?  Roland, could you believe the sassiness of City?  But I just played the clips of you and me meeting, just talking to the people next to us on the red carpet because we had nothing happening. 
[00:36:30]  Nothing at all.  You had the outline, though, when I said, you know, are we still going to get Steve Martin and Anne Hathaway?  We will.  You said, yeah, we'll get them running by our ass.  That's right.  Were you nervous when you saw, like, Mayor Bloomberg and the Olsen twins just leaving us, but nothing was going to happen?  No, I knew we were going to get the world's strongest man, at least.  So, Hugo.  You were all about Hugo.  Hugo was a big guy.  Yeah, and anybody we wanted from the Tribeca board. 
[00:37:00]  The juror, the guy, Mark, did you Google him?  He's huge.  Is he?  No.  No.  I felt bad for a couple of the people from Tribeca.  Like, the point is the publicist is supposed to go to each venue and say, hey, do you want to talk to this person?  And then we can either say yes or no.  A couple of the Tribeca people were getting turned down so many times that they caught up with their publicist.  So, literally, they were right behind the woman, and they'd be like, no, I don't want to talk to them.  And, like, they could see me saying no. 
[00:37:30]  Or my favorite is where the guy, his wife goes, why don't you talk to these people?  And the guy just looked down on the ground, and he said, nobody wants to interview me.  I'm just going to go.  I'm sorry.  No, go ahead, Eric.  Next time you guys go do this, and if you have a similar situation where you're not really getting anybody, but all the bigger stars are just walking past, if you have video and your mic rolling, just leave it on and hang it over the railing just to see if you can hear them, tell them, like, who they're passing on.  Yeah.  They move so fast.  They do.  They're out of there.  Like, whoosh. 
[00:38:00]  But, Roland, we've got to wrap up.  There's another show coming up next.  No Ronnie B.  He's outside the studio.  I think he's a little busy.  Yeah, but you have to do one question after you do it in 15 minutes.  15 minutes.  Okay.  We've got more one questions.  We're always working on something.  Ronnie B. looks a little busy, so I think we're just going to let him.  Yeah, we've got to.  There.  Ronnie B.  There he is, but we've got to go.  We've got to go.  We're in your time.  All right, we're going.  We're going.  It's after O.B.  Stay tuned for Rotter Fest next. 
[00:38:30]  O.B. and Anthony's show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O.N.A. show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash O.B. and Anthony.  And catch O.B. and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey.  On the virus. </pre>
