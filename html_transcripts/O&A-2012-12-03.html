<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a review of *The Hobbit*. Opie and Jim Norton recounted their experience at a high frame-rate 3D screening, comparing the visuals to a View-Master and praising the film's comedic elements and Martin Freeman's performance, while avoiding spoilers.  They were surprised by positive Twitter reactions to their enjoyment of the film, given its fantasy subject matter.

The show then shifted to the hosts' weekend activities. Opie described a heavy drinking session with Joe DeRosa, involving numerous JÃ¤germeister shots and a subsequent hangover.  They discussed various TV shows, including *Red Eye*, *The Walking Dead*, and *Homeland*.  The sold-out Patrice O'Neal tribute concert was mentioned, along with disgust at StubHub scalpers.  A significant portion of the show focused on the Jovan Belcher murder-suicide, leading to a debate on gun control, referencing Bob Costas's commentary and Jason Whitlock's article.  They also discussed a fake *Planet of the Apes* viral video featuring a monkey with a gun, and a debated-authenticity parrot singing video; a caller even weighed in on African Grey parrots.  The discussion concluded with plans for getting pets for Opie's son and a mention of a cat vs. dog YouTube video.

The gun control debate continued, with callers offering various perspectives and statistics on gun violence across different states, including a discussion of a Georgia town mandating gun ownership. The hypocrisy of gun control debates was highlighted, comparing it to the lack of similar calls for alcohol prohibition despite its high death toll. The hosts also discussed violence in football and its potential influence on Belcher.  This segued into a graphic description of a mall shooting scene from a TV show, followed by a discussion of Texas gun culture and a tangential discussion of the hosts' vacation time and studio space.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to playing entries from a past "most offensive song contest."  Numerous songs with extremely offensive lyrics about violence, racism, pedophilia, incest, and the Holocaust were played and discussed, including songs like "Baby Raper," "Camp Concentration," "Horny for Little Girls," "Just Bone My Daughter," "Oh mein Fuhrer," "Schindler's List," "Stuck in an Oven," "Viva Das Auschwitz," and "Don't Let Daddy Kiss Me" (a Motorhead song). The hosts discussed the potential backlash and the context of the contest's original broadcast on terrestrial radio.  This segment also included commentary on Ivanka Trump's appearance and Penn Jillette's book about *Celebrity Apprentice*.

The "most offensive song contest" discussion continued into another segment, with further song entries played and discussed.  Marky Ramone was mentioned as a guest on Jessica Hall's show on Playboy Radio, whose lack of professionalism was contrasted with Marky Ramone's presence.  Hugh Hefner's Twitter feed and a coworker's marital problems were also discussed at length, with humorous commentary and listener-submitted observations.  Marky Ramone was present in the studio during this portion.

The show concluded with a discussion about a shoeless homeless man and a reminiscence of their canceled "homeless shopping spree" segment, highlighting the conflict with a female executive and Tom.  They mentioned several deceased individuals associated with the show, including "Ziggy," who earlier sang "Silent Night."  The hosts mocked a staged plane crash news report, and discussed Lindsay Lohan's substance abuse issues, referencing Mike Tyson's commentary.  They also commented on the Pope's and Dalai Lama's (allegedly fake) Twitter accounts. The show ended with promotional announcements for Jimmy's comedy shows and CDs, Steven Singer Jewelers, a Rot Gut gig, and the playing of a song about a woman's buttocks. The entire broadcast was liberally peppered with profanity and crude humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Here we go.  There we go. And that's how we begin, huh?  And they're off!  Ladies and gentlemen, it is now post-time.  Me and Jim Norton just did five minutes on The Hobbit. I wish we would have waited.  Yeah.  Because now we've got to do that whole thing over again.  I don't mind.  Last we left you, me and Jim Norton were going to see The Hobbit.  Yeah.  Special screening. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  After Friday's amazing show where we walked out on Joe Piscopo.  I thought it was a phone problem.  Is he calling today?  Oh, boy.  He's all excited. He said something like, I'm really into this whole O&A thing that's going on.  Jesus.  Jesus, Joe.  Anyway, we ran off to The Hobbit. Literally ran to the special screening.  And, wow, we were blown away, weren't we?  It was...  And it's not my genre of movies, I was saying, I hope.  But I liked it very much. 
[00:01:00]  And the way it was shot, we saw the 3D, not regular 3D, but the 48 frames per second.  Yeah, high frame rate.  But they're calling it something.  Yeah, there's a name for it.  And all I can say is, it was so...  It almost looked fake.  And I'm saying that in a good way.  Like, it was so realistic.  It's like, it doesn't feel like a movie experience, because you're almost...  It's like watching a guy in the room next to you.  It was really weird.  And I told Ant before this, the Viewmaster was the only way I could describe it. 
[00:01:30]  Right.  The reality changed when you were a kid and you looked to a Viewmaster.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Brand new technology as a...  As a Viewmaster.  As a Viewmaster.  But you're clicking it really fast.  Yeah.  The Viewmaster.  But the effect that had on you...  Remember, Viewmaster, you're like...  You're sitting there and you're in regular reality and then you look into this weird thing  and there was nothing like it.  It freaked you out.  It was like so real looking.  Yes, the Viewmaster.  You think it still looks so real, Viewmaster?  We gotta get an old school Viewmaster and try it out again. 
[00:02:00]  The Borgata sent me a New Year's Eve invitation in a Viewmaster.  Really?  Yeah, so you hold it up and you look.  It came in the mail.  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  And you hold it up and it's like pictures of the Borgata inside and like a New Year's  Eve show and stuff in a 3D Viewmaster.  Did it look pretty cool?  Yeah, it was like...  It brought me right back.  Of course.  I remember looking at the Grand Canyon one.  Yeah, shit like that.  And you felt like you were right on the rim looking into the whole damn thing.  Because it surrounds your eyes.  Right.  There's no peripheral interference.  I'm just seeing that. 
[00:02:30]  You just seen that.  Fucking weird looking 3D.  You nailed it.  It surrounds your eyes.  Yeah.  Because I never felt like I looked off to the side or anything like that.  It was shot beautifully, man.  It's one of the best shot films I've ever seen.  It's not the best shot.  It's way better than regular 3D.  I was telling Anthony, they didn't have to...  Peter Jackson wasn't like, hey, this is 3D and let's throw stuff at you.  See, 3D.  Yeah, reach out and try to grab it.  That old gag.  There were a couple subtle things.  And I told Ann, I don't even remember the subtle things.  But then you reminded me.  It was like a bird and maybe a butterfly. 
[00:03:00]  And that was about it.  They didn't have to shove the 3D at you.  They make it more immersive than 3D now.  Where it's like, yeah, you feel like you're looking into the movie more than the movie coming out at you.  Right.  Yeah.  There was a couple of moments.  There was one early on where the 3D is so good.  It's so fucking good that there was...  I made a slight noise because I thought somebody stood up.  Oh, shit.  And it was the camera panning in on one of the characters. 
[00:03:30]  I literally thought a person in the fucking theater stood up.  No kidding.  That was very early in the movie and I was like, wow.  Sit down!  I'm so glad I did.  There was a lot of moments where I really...  There was a couple of times where I wanted to do Chip and all these...  There's a dragon in the theater!  He had his gold coins and stuff.  But it was...  I can't even...  There's no way to do it justice.  You have to see it.  And if you can see it in the 3D version that opened, I saw it in.  Well, there's going to be a regular 3D version. 
[00:04:00]  Because we could have went today for the regular 3D.  Or the special screening with this new technology.  I don't know what it's called.  It's 3D something.  Because they said...  I saw a trailer for it last night.  And they said in 3D and 48 3D or whatever it was called.  Whatever it was.  I would go for that one.  Yeah.  Wow.  It was great.  I was telling Jimmy there was a lot of jokes in there.  Yeah.  There was some good comedy.  It looked amazing.  Like you were telling Anthony, we're not giving anything away because...  Yeah, no.  It is a book.  But the dragon scene was, like you just said, was amazing.  It was...  You feel like there's just... 
[00:04:30]  You just feel like shit that's happening in the movie is happening to you.  Right.  It's really...  We talk...  It's like it had a weird...  Oh, HFR 3D.  High frame rate 3D.  Okay.  HFR 3D.  Look for that viewing.  Yeah.  And again, if you see regular 3D, I'm sure this is still amazing.  Oh, sure.  Sure, sure, sure.  Because I want to see it in IMAX 3D, too.  I'm going to go back and see it again.  On my own dime!  Wow.  Was there wizardry in the movie?  There was a lot of wizardry.  There was some wizardry.  Wizardry. 
[00:05:00]  There was plenty of...  Oh, I was thinking of Ted all the way home, actually.  Really?  Yes, all the hobbit wizardry.  Wizardry.  Wizardry, yes.  What's his name as the hobbit there was great.  Martin Freeman, yeah.  Martin, and he's coming in tomorrow, right?  Yes.  Bilbo Baggins.  Yeah, of course.  He was great.  Tim from the original UK office.  And I kept seeing Tim from the office in it, and it's because he played it like...  I loved how he played it.  He played it like a guy.  He didn't play it like this mystical creature.  He was just...  He played it like an actor playing him... 
[00:05:30]  It was weird.  He didn't mystical creature it up.  Right.  Which I loved.  You didn't see any of the Lord of the Rings, right?  No, I was busy exercising.  Yes.  Because the hobbits are kind of your working class mystical land kind of creatures.  So you're not going to get a lot of, you know, kind of elfin speech out of them or anything.  Yeah, no, it's great.  But that's...  Yeah, because he's a pretty good choice for that character.  I think he's great.  I think people that are real fans of this whole thing, the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, 
[00:06:00]  I think they're going to love the choice when they see it.  And you were saying it's lighter than Lord of the Rings ones?  I thought it was lighter.  Lord of the Rings, definitely darker than the Hobbit.  They kept it a little lighter, and there was definitely more comedy in this one.  Loved the characters.  Yeah.  Loved them.  Loved what they looked like.  One guy looked like Liam Neeson, but that wasn't him.  No, no, no.  It sounded like him, and it looked like him.  I know what you're going to say.  No, I don't think so.  But the acting was ridiculous.  To think fucking Peter Jackson was making those cheeseball fucking horror movies for 
[00:06:30]  his entire career.  What was some of his cheeseball...  I don't even remember anymore.  No one really remembers them, because they would just like...  And then what was the big...  They were B-horror movies.  King Kong he did?  Yeah, that was after Lord of the Rings.  But Lord of the Rings took him from that shit to...  What was his big movie that turned him?  The Frighteners.  All right.  That was the one where he started moving forward?  Yeah, that kind of gave him a little bit of a name. 
[00:07:00]  But the Lord of the Rings went to put him on a whole other fucking level where he did  shit that just wasn't being done in movies.  He's doing trilogies.  That's all he's doing.  If he can't shoot all three at once, he's not interested.  Right.  One of my favorite things to do is go fishing on Twitter.  So after the movie, I just wrote...  That was funny.  It's unbelievable, though.  And I know they're not fucking playing back with me.  I go, I just saw The Hobbit.  The movie was amazing, but it's so, in big letters, so unbelievable. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, no.  People actually wrote me back.  No!  Oh, a book about hobbits and goblins and dwarfs is not believed.  I'm like, really?  Yeah.  And I know that.  And then you check their shit, and you're like, oh, my God, this guy really means it.  Yes.  They're not busting balls back.  Not pulling the double sarcasm on you.  Holy fuck.  Are you kidding me?  Some people are so stupid on Twitter, it's astounding.  That's what you learn, right?  Yes.  And I call it fishing, and then my followers, they go, oh, we got one. 
[00:08:00]  We got a few.  Got a nibble.  We got a few today.  Fucking dummies.  Movie was amazing, but I think we all knew it was going to be amazing.  And then my brother, I took my brother and my nephew, and after the screening, he looks  at me, he's like, can we applaud?  Because he's all in.  He's a massive fan.  He's read all the books.  They're just all about it.  And I'm like, yeah, they're a bunch of stiffs.  So he started clapping anyway.  But it was all reviewers and shit. 
[00:08:30]  Oh, really?  And then they're standing outside the screening area on the street.  Did you see those douches?  No, I was behind you by a few minutes.  Discussing the movie, but in a way where they're just taking the fun out of the whole experience.  Did they like it?  They liked it, but they were just discussing.  I didn't even want to stick around for it.  You just could tell it was a horrendous conversation happening on the sidewalk.  So that was The Hobbit on Friday.  Comes out in two weeks.  Yes.  The 14th, I guess.  A little less than two weeks now.  What else can we say about the movie? 
[00:09:00]  See, we're not really allowed to say much.  Yeah, they asked us not to talk about it.  There's an embargo.  Yeah, they were just so fast.  You know, fair enough.  Fair enough, sir.  They treat us nice and allowed us to see it ahead of time.  I think you're doing a good job just saying that it's fucking amazing and looks great.  I can't wait to see it, yeah.  I was saying I don't go to the movies for, like, just movies for the most part.  Oh, you've got to go there.  It's very rare.  Oh, God, you've got to go for this one.  I was saying that they have to do something.  The theaters have to do something to bring people back into the theaters because, for 
[00:09:30]  the most part, you could watch it at home and get a great experience with a standard  movie.  So they had to come up with some kind of technology that goes, look, you're not getting this at  home.  Right.  So please see it in the theater.  Right.  So I guess it's working.  When you end up in a movie theater and it's just a run-of-the-mill type of movie where  you could have easily waited for it to be on demand or what have you.  Yeah.  And you hear the movie starting and you hear that crackling, like the, you know, the film 
[00:10:00]  or whatever.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're like, what am I doing?  This technology is ancient.  Yes.  You're right.  It should be an experience that you just can't get anywhere else.  It throws you for a loop how well, how clear that shooting was, man.  It's not, it really was like when you'd watch it, and I know I'm making horrible comparisons,  but I'm saying the effect it has on your eyes.  Like when you watch regular movies and then the 80s when video and you'd watch a porn, 
[00:10:30]  it was a weird, jarring thing because it wasn't like any movie you'd ever seen.  It looked almost like there was some fake shit, some weird stuff in your TV.  Yeah.  This is what this was like.  It was like, it felt like you were sitting there with these people.  It was such a bizarre, perfect, clear 3D film.  Oh my God, yeah.  The whole depth, even the shit in the background was crystal clear.  Everything.  It was unbelievable.  I found myself in some of these scenes just looking around at the world in front of me 
[00:11:00]  going, wow, look at this.  And it's taking me out of the story for a minute.  But there was a waterfall.  It's amazing.  There was a waterfall in one scene, and I'm like, wow, look at that waterfall.  It looks really, oh fuck, what am I missing over here?  Like no one watches a movie like that.  This is major plot shit happening right now.  You don't watch a movie like that.  You watch a movie, you take the whole thing in at once like that.  That's odd, because some of the 3D movies I've been to, and they haven't been nearly  as good as what I hear this is.  Friday the 13th 3D.  Oh, amazing.  You do kind of look around. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, that's what I was doing.  You're like, oh, looking at individual things in the movie instead of taking it all in at  once like that.  At one point, I'm thinking, man, that would be a cool place to live.  Oh God, yeah.  You have a little cliff over here where you can have your coffee.  There's a waterfall over here.  The sun's coming through.  Over the mountaintops?  Oh, fuck, what's happening?  You know what, dude?  They're explaining something major right now.  You got your gold, your wizard hat, boom, dude.  You relax, you have your coffee, you got three dimensions, dude.  You big birds.  Whatever those things were called, orcs.  Yeah.  They were great. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, the nasty orcs?  Yeah, see, I'd never heard of them before.  Yeah.  And I'm like, what an amazing fucking horrible bad guy that was.  And there was this one monsters in there.  They look like Edgar.  Let's just say the ones that were big, the big clay ones, the three that we're eating,  they just kept reminding me of-  Around the campfire?  Yeah, they reminded me of Edgar.  Edgar monsters.  That was probably my favorite scene in the whole movie.  I loved that.  Edgar.  Loved it.  It was great.  Those dopes around the campfire, trying to figure out, yeah, whatever, we got to shut  up.  Yeah, we won't blow it, but it's just, it's great. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I recommend it very, very highly.  Even if he wasn't coming in tomorrow, I would.  Now watch him cancel and I trash it.  So, that was Friday.  How was everyone's weekend?  Oh, Jesus.  I had a shitty weekend just because I had to babysit the entire weekend.  So I felt like I didn't have a weekend.  I love being a father, but I don't love babysitting.  Babysitting.  My wife was very busy this weekend, so I had, like, nonstop fun and hangout time with my  son. 
[00:13:00]  Yeah.  Which is, it was cool to a point.  Then I'm like, fuck, I want to go to the gym.  I want to do my shit.  I want to do some of my shit.  Nah.  Didn't get that this weekend.  I usually get that stuff, though.  I had a completely wasted fucking weekend.  Because of Joe DeRosa?  Figuratively and literally.  I hate that we know what everyone's doing.  Yeah, Twitter does that.  Because of stupid Twitter.  I already know that you went out with Joe DeRosa.  Look, this is what you did.  Friday, you chilled out.  Then you did Red Eye.  Yeah.  That went well.  Then you went drinking with Joe DeRosa. 
[00:13:30]  He forced shots down your throat.  Yeah.  Even though he said, I wasn't twisting your arm at the end.  That's right.  And then because of the major partying with Joe DeRosa, you wasted Saturday.  Wasted Saturday.  See, I know.  That's pretty much it.  I know that's what you're going to tell everybody.  You were very funny on Red Eye.  Because I never get to watch it because I'm never up.  It was so weird.  I was enjoying you.  Bernard McGurk.  Yeah, yeah.  I love Bernie.  It was so odd to not have fucking Bill or Greg there.  Oh, you know what?  Bill not being...  It looked weird to me. 
[00:14:00]  That was what it was.  Where was Bill?  Bill was out.  That's what looked weird.  Yeah, it was fucking like...  So, who ran the ship?  Tom Shalhoub.  Who's a funny comedian?  Yeah, yeah.  I know Tom.  He was good.  He hung out.  I know Tom, I should say.  He hung out, too.  After the show, we went out.  That's when DeRosa came.  And then those guys left.  And then...  They probably went to Queer Off.  Yeah, they went to Mo Off.  And then, actually, Jay Moors came down.  Where'd you see Jay?  We were hanging out at the old... 
[00:14:30]  The Pig and Whistle.  Oh, sure.  The old Channel 4, it's called.  So, we hung out there.  And then Jay Moors showed up.  And me, DeRosa, and Jay Moors was hanging out for probably a couple of hours.  Ah, fuck.  I had nothing to do Friday.  I was lonely.  Oh, we were fucking laughing our asses off.  And then Jay left.  And that's when DeRosa goes,  Oh, I know this place downtown.  Let's head down there.  So, we went downtown and fucking...  You know, I do very well when I'm on my own as far as drinking goes.  Like, like... 
[00:15:00]  And I don't mean alone, but I mean...  Like, I know what I want.  When you're in control.  And I get it.  But DeRosa...  I fucking cave into drinking peer pressure worse than I did when I was a teen.  When Joe starts going, do you want to do a shot?  And I'm like, I don't know.  Is it...  Pussy!  What are you, a pussy?  All right.  Yes.  I'll do a shot.  Because then you start thinking how fun shots is.  The whole ritual of doing a shot.  You order it.  And then you wait.  And then there it is.  And you're like, oh, the shots are here. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  And you grab them.  And you give a little, hey, salute.  What was the poison?  Uh, Jaeger.  Ah.  I was drinking some Jaeger Meister.  That brings me back to Buffalo.  But, um...  Those cold winters and those Jaeger shots.  Yeah.  We're a good combination for that hellhole.  Yeah.  No offense to Buffalo, but you know what I'm talking about.  Those winters get a bit long.  It was...  How many do you do?  I don't know.  Over the course of the whole night, there were a couple at Pig & Whistle.  Then there were a couple at the place we went... 
[00:16:00]  We went to a comedy club downtown.  Some new place, I guess.  What's it called?  Sheesh.  Some stuff in an SH.  Uh, you know this place?  I do not.  Shit house?  No.  Colin was down there.  The Shucks?  No.  Oh.  Shucks.  Nah.  God damn it.  I can't remember that.  You ran into Colin Quayne, too?  No, no, no.  Uh, Colin had played down there.  Okay.  I guess they're starting up.  Not the stand.  Not Stan.  Yeah, there it is.  Oh, Stan. 
[00:16:30]  That's not...  What is it?  It's not too new.  That's on, uh...  But that's on, like, 1st and 20...  Yeah.  Or 3rd...  Oh, shit.  I forgot.  Ozzy's birthday.  Sorry.  Happy birthday, Ozzy.  64?  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  December 3rd, right?  Wow.  Uh, yeah.  So, uh, we went down there.  I didn't know, you know, how long it had been there or whatnot.  But, yeah, we went there.  And then it was closing up.  So, we went to the bar right next door.  And that's pretty much where we spent the rest of the evening.  And then we went out to breakfast. 
[00:17:00]  I don't know.  It was definitely, um, the next day.  It was definitely Saturday when we left.  Wow.  You know, to the guys that say, come on, stop being a pussy.  What you gotta do is suck it up the next morning.  Even though your hangover is brutal, get a fucking frying pan.  Find out where they fucking live.  And then show them.  Yeah.  Come on, what?  You being a pussy?  You gonna be a pussy?  Yeah.  I hate that.  Oh, dude.  I was...  I know what you're saying, because you're pacing your own self. 
[00:17:30]  You're like, alright, man.  Yeah.  I know I could do another four.  I was doing good with the Cap'n and Cokes.  Or beers, whatever.  But those shots throw it into fucking overdrive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't miss that shit.  So, I stayed at my...  I don't miss the shot shit at all.  I stayed at my apartment, um, Friday night into Saturday morning.  And then, uh, then you reach that point Saturday morning where I'm looking around the apartment  and go, I gotta get home.  Um, so I, I just had to suck it up and, and get in my truck and drive the fuck home all  hung over, feeling like shit.  You should stay in the city. 
[00:18:00]  No, because I like...  You don't have to get home to anything.  No, I like being home.  I got my Xbox there and everything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just had to get the fuck home.  So, uh, yeah.  And then Saturday was a complete just recoup on the couch, watching lousy television and  doing nothing.  Mm.  Yeah.  Very good.  Uh, that was about it.  And then last night watched, um, no spoilers, don't worry, but, uh, Walking Dead.  Yes.  Uh, one thing I noticed about Walking Dead, though, that they fuck up because it was the mid-season, 
[00:18:30]  um, thing, mid-season fucking finale.  Finale.  So they don't start up until February.  But let's just say a couple of characters are in a precarious position, right?  And you're not sure what's going to happen.  Mm-hmm.  Well, in the fucking preview for the premiere of the next fucking episode in February, they  show the guy.  Always.  I never watch those.  Right.  I never do either.  I hit stop.  But I fucking...  Why do they have to do that? 
[00:19:00]  So you know that he's okay, it's fucked up.  That's the network being stupid.  That's being sloppy.  That's stupidity.  Totally sloppy.  Yes.  Totally sloppy.  Totally fucking sloppy.  I saw a still from, um, Walking Dead.  One of the dudes from The Wire is in it?  He leads, like...  Do you know I was...  He leads a group or something?  I was looking to see if that was Cuddy.  Um...  It is Cuddy, right?  Oh, it is him.  Okay, good.  That's who I was thinking.  I forgot his character name until you just said it.  But Cuddy is in The Walking Dead?  His real name is Derek Coleman, um, or something Coleman. 
[00:19:30]  I forgot where I saw it.  In the paper?  Chad Coleman.  I think it was online when I was flipping around, uh, news sites.  I thought that was him.  Entertainment sites.  I'm happy that he's got a gig.  I love Chad Coleman.  That's Cuddy.  That's absolutely Cuddy.  Is that him?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I recognized him.  Those Wire guys, man.  They continue to work, huh?  Yeah.  Michael K. Williams is amazing.  And Boardwalk Empire is chalky white.  They pop up all over the place, man.  And, um...  So, do I watch Homeland or, um...  Homeland, dude.  Or Empire Boardwalk. 
[00:20:00]  I gotta say, Homeland, the acting is brilliant.  Like, Claire Danes is amazing.  Damian Lewis is great.  They're all great.  I'm so behind on fucking shows, man.  But the story, this season, in season five, they did...  Season two, I'm sorry.  I did one thing.  Oh, God.  You said season five.  I'm like, all right, that's out.  I don't have time for five seasons.  I won't give any spoilers.  But they did something this season.  I'm like, don't do it.  It's a small thing.  But it made the story, from what I saw as being fairly plausible, like, all right, I 
[00:20:30]  can go with that, to this one thing they did where I'm like, nope.  Really?  And now I just, I feel like I'm watching a Bugs Bunny cartoon.  It's all it takes.  Do you watch Homeland, Travis?  I'll make love to you later.  We'll talk about it.  I want to know what you think.  While I'm fucking balls deep in that Travis buttocks.  Sounds good to me.  Did you pick up on that at all, or no?  No, but I probably will agree with you.  Because this season's lacking in believability. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  Maybe I won't watch that one.  No, dude, the acting is so good, it's worth watching.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to acknowledge that Patrice O'Neill special did great this weekend.  A lot of people.  Oh, no, I was going to say that as well, but the special we ran on this channel.  Yes.  The feedback on it was just over the top.  Yeah.  Over the top, everyone reaching out about how great the weekend was here at our channel.  I'm looking around for the channel number.  I always forget.  Something like that. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, it's like 300 and something.  It's 101 apart, which is always easy.  105 and 206.  God, I hope the new guys figure out some shit.  I got a whole list of stuff I'm handing in to the new guy.  For real.  Yeah.  Because I do want this place to be better.  There's just dumb things that they continue to do.  But anyway, people love the Patrice special.  And yeah, Jimmy said at the Tribute concert, sold out in one day.  Sold out on Friday.  It's so great.  And now we got assholes on StubHub selling their fucking tickets, trying to make money 
[00:22:00]  off this thing.  Well, we should find out who's selling them on StubHub.  How does that work?  It's a benefit for his family.  Disgusting.  They are just fucking cocksuckers.  So if you make a bunch of money off your ticket, how about you give some of the profits to  the family?  Do the right thing, you fucks.  What is StubHub?  People are just, are these scalpers buying it?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  All that.  Are you able to find out who these pieces of shit are?  They're all in business together, man.  Of course.  The only way you can find out is if you actually buy the ticket.  I wish there was always just to write them and go, you're fucking scumbags. 
[00:22:30]  They're all in cahoots together.  Who are you kidding?  What scumbags?  There are people trying to get like over $600 for their ticket.  Yeah, and they probably will because there's a lot of people that want to go to this thing.  Well, the thing that they...  You guys should add a second show.  I don't know how...  I don't know if that's possible in any way.  I'm just saying.  Well...  I think a second show would absolutely sell out.  I will say this.  If you can't get to the Patrice Benefit, I will be in Caroline's April 11th through 14th.  And I'm...  Look, I'm not going to say...  A part of me wants to say that if you can't get to the Patrice Benefit, you should go see 
[00:23:00]  me because it's what he would have wanted.  He absolutely would laugh at that.  Yeah, of course he would.  Do you know what I was doing when Patrice...  I think when he first died, it was very hard to deal with with the audience because the  audience all knows how close we were.  I mean, and we were plugging...  I was plugging Master P on stage just to get people to go to iTunes and buy it.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:23:30]  Master P, I'm so tired.  Mister, mister.  Mr. P, I'm so tired.  But I was plugging on stage, but you didn't want it to be like a funeral dirge.  It was like, how do you do it and get out of it with a laugh?  So I was doing that.  I was plugging it and talking about how great he was.  Sure.  And then just saying, if not, to buy my shit.  And people enjoy that.  People love the special, so thank you.  I'm happy that they did.  And I'm so happy we sold it out today.  We didn't need to go anywhere. 
[00:24:00]  We didn't worry about who was doing it, who wasn't doing it.  We got it sold out.  I heard within the first hour there were not a lot of great seats left.  I went online and was looking, and you could still pick up some tickets.  I'm on Twitter, but I'm so aggravated about this StubHub.  They do it with every concert.  I know that, but they're just...  We put hoots together, I'm telling you.  StubHub is able to...  I don't know exactly how it works.  Someone could maybe help us out.  But StubHub gets tickets for every hot show.  Every hot show.  So, you know, I believe the two are working together a little bit. 
[00:24:30]  I really do believe that.  Giving the StubHub people, you know, a little shot, a little help to get their tickets.  In this case, though, it was probably individuals, because there's not a lot of tickets on StubHub.  Yeah, there's only 10 tickets on StubHub.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  And this is a thing where individuals...  Oh, that makes me happier.  Yeah, this is a thing where individuals post their own tickets, and it looks like only  eight have sold.  So there's eight that have sold, and 10 people, and 10...  All right, that's not as bad. 
[00:25:00]  No, considering how many seats the venue holds, that's very good, actually, for...  Of course.  ...for secondary market.  Of course.  All right.  Anyone watch football?  I always talk about the Jets, and then I find out that people just don't want to hear  about the Jets, because they have their own team.  They have their teams, their respective teams.  I heard about what happened with the Jets.  I heard Sanchez got yanked out of there.  Finally.  And...  Finally got yanked out.  And I guess Tebow's got some hurt ribs, so they didn't put him in? 
[00:25:30]  Well, I mean, a lot of people are saying conspiracy.  Right.  Because they, you know, Rex Ryan waits for the game where he knows he can't put Tebow  in there.  Right.  And finally yanked Sanchez, because he could easily yank Sanchez before now.  He could have.  Yeah, yeah.  And now we're going to get the hardcore Jets fans arguing that point with me, but whatever.  That's how I feel.  And, yeah, Tebow wasn't dressed for the game, so they got to go with McIlroy.  McIlroy.  And then McIlroy, who's a third-string quarterback there for the Jets, he was quite the player in 
[00:26:00]  college, but he sat out all last year, I believe, with a thumb injury.  I don't know much about McIlroy.  I'm not even going to make believe I do.  He gets in there, marches down the field, and does exactly what people want Sanchez to  do.  Score.  And score.  He looked all right for a third-string quarterback coming in after not playing in the NFL for  over a year.  This might have been his first game ever.  I'm not even sure.  How bad was Sanchez in the beginning?  Did he really have... 
[00:26:30]  Horrible.  He had three interceptions.  Oh, he stinks, this guy.  And then he had another one that absolutely should have been an interception.  So, you know, three, possibly four interceptions.  He stinks.  He stinks.  I don't know what it is with him.  He's got to...  And then everyone's talking about him writing on that clipboard.  He leaves the game and he's just writing on a clipboard as McIlroy's doing the right  thing.  And my point is that he obviously was making believe he was writing shit on the clipboard  because he doesn't want to show his utter disgust that the third-string went in and did the 
[00:27:00]  job he was supposed to do.  He's not going to be happy about that.  No.  That's really bad for him.  The third-stringer goes in and does the job.  I also hate...  What's his name?  Who's that coach?  Rex Ryan?  I don't like him either.  Even though I like that he has a foot fetish.  I was a fan of Rex Ryan.  He's a tootsie lover.  I was a fan of Rex Ryan for a while, but I don't know.  I'm not that much of a fan these days.  I think a lot of Jets fans aren't as rah-rah with Rex Ryan right now.  He's become extremely stubborn with the Sanchez thing. 
[00:27:30]  He believes in Sanchez, I guess.  I don't know.  His guy's a bum.  Sanchez is a bum.  Accept it.  A bum.  He's not really getting the job done.  No.  I don't believe we have a chance at a Super Bowl with Mark Sanchez as the quarterback.  What happened with the Cowboys?  I was watching that game.  It was a great game.  Of course, because I wasn't watching it.  And then I was tired.  I was tuckered out, and I had a bail on the game.  It was 7-0 when I went down to the Comedy Show last night, and it was 7-0. 
[00:28:00]  And I'm just so disgusted with that organization.  I don't care if they win or lose.  I hate that fucking cocksucker owner slash GM arrangement so much.  So I was home.  I'm on comedian schedule now, where I'm going to bed at 8 in the morning again and waking up at 4.30,  going to the gym at like 6 and then leaving for my...  You know, it's like...  So my whole...  I'm fucking in nighttime, so I'm laying wide awake.  I just watched Walking Dead. 
[00:28:30]  I just couldn't fucking do anything.  No.  No.  I tugged out a load.  Tugged out a load.  It doesn't even sound pleasurable when you say it.  That should be...  Isn't that supposed to be like, at least like, all right, at least it felt good.  You're like, ah, it's a mandatory thing.  I'm telling you.  Tugged out a load.  You're going to forget.  That has to be the name of your next CD.  Tugging out a load.  Tugging out a load.  Tugging out a load.  Yeah.  Tugged out a load.  Tugged out a load. 
[00:29:00]  That was what it was.  It wasn't even fun.  Yeah.  Although my dick looked really good.  It was like a rock.  Oh, man.  Cowboys ended up winning last night.  38-31, yeah.  38-33.  Oh, okay.  I'm happy they won, though.  I mean, look, it's hard to root against as they see the uniform.  I just don't like Tony Romo.  Ever since, I just don't think...  I hate guys like that in sports who can never get it done when you need them.  And they've won one playoff game since 96.  What does that tell you as an owner GM? 
[00:29:30]  You're shit.  You're shit.  I feel like our teams have the same quarterback.  Yes.  I really feel that.  Romo and Sanchez.  You know, they got the skills.  The mechanics, as they like to say.  They got good mechanics.  But you have to have that fucking heart.  No heart.  I don't think Sanchez has it.  I think he fucking panics.  And Romo certainly has proven that as well.  What was I watching on YouTube?  I went into a YouTube spiral just watching.  Those are the best.  Oh, I know.  But you wind up on... 
[00:30:00]  You start off on Kiss videos and you wind up on fucking theoretical physics.  That's why it's great.  Then the fucking monkey with the gun.  Did you see that one?  It's from fucking...  Oh boy, I could say something right now.  I know.  But did you see the video?  Yes.  I think it's fake.  I don't know if it is or not.  There's a part of it that...  It's supposed to be like these African soldiers.  There's four of them and they give this wild monkey a gun.  So unless it was a fake gun and it was a trained animal...  But the setting looked fairly realistic. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  How do you get the bullets to happen that way?  I think it's like CGI'd.  Oh, you know what?  Maybe it is.  I think it is.  It's too crazy.  Like the...  Oh, those guys don't look...  It's a pretty old clip.  Those guys don't look real.  No.  See, it's like...  It's like...  It's a Planet of the Apes thing.  What do you mean?  Like it's a Planet of the Apes viral...  Viral video for the movie.  Oh, okay.  It says, purchase tickets from Fandango.  Yeah, this is the old one. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, this guy's racking.  That looks fake the way they were overacting.  Yeah.  Yeah, and the timer on the bottom is fake.  It says Century Fox Research Lab.  Oh, okay, okay.  I never...  Which would be hilarious, though, if that fucking ever...  If that really did happen...  Fucking hilarious.  Well.  Got on my gullible asshole.  Yes, you are, Jimmy.  It's a commercial for Planet of the Apes.  I'm so gullible.  In 2011. 
[00:31:30]  In 2011.  How about the one that ran up to the top of the Empire State?  That was real.  I'm a fool.  I'm a fool.  It's set on the corner.  20th Century Fox Research Library.  I hadn't looked at that, though.  My friend showed me.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  The user is ApesWillRise.  Oops.  I got one, too, then.  Yeah?  It just hit yesterday.  The parrot singing Let the Bodies Hit the Floor.  Really?  I didn't see that. 
[00:32:00]  Is that real?  No, I don't know.  I'm thinking it might be.  This one, it will be...  This will go viral within the next day or two.  My weekend favorite one was the guy with his head on fire that's making the news.  This one.  It's got 7 million views from two years ago.  Oh, then someone reposted it yesterday.  We might have even did this already.  Yeah, I think we did.  I remember this one.  Yeah, okay. 
[00:32:30]  That's real, dude.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You'd have to kill that fucking thing.  I'm an idiot, too, because now, of course, we did this already. 
[00:33:00]  We did this a couple years ago.  My point on this video, if you have a parrot that could do that, right, how it's shot is  very suspicious.  Uh-huh.  Because couldn't you imitate a parrot?  Couldn't you fucking...  Yeah, that's a pretty good job of imitating a parrot, though.  Well, you have to find someone that could absolutely imitate it well.  But how it's shot, it's kind of the parrot's sort of in the darkness a little bit.  You could see it move in its mouth or whatever the fuck, it's beak a little bit.  But that's what it is, too.  It doesn't really move its beak to the words like a parrot, so it doesn't really matter. 
[00:33:30]  It just opens its mouth and the dumb words come out.  I'm just suspicious of that video and other parrot videos, because if you could fucking  wreck your voice like that and imitate a parrot pretty well.  But all those little, like, imperfections in there, too, where it's not really getting  the words out.  Why didn't you film it better?  I don't know.  People are stupid.  Why don't you light up that fucking cage?  Maybe if you light up the cage or whatever, then he's not going to do it.  Maybe he shuts up.  He clams up.  Yeah, I guess.  He likes it looking like a stage.  Yeah.  He's performing.  And I'm a dummy.  That hit yesterday.  Someone sent it to me, and the original video has 7 million views, so... 
[00:34:00]  You see that guy in the Dominican Republic on that talk show, that magician?  Oh, yeah.  And the host comes over and just lights his fucking head on fire?  Is it real?  Yes.  It's sick.  What I meant was, was it part of the trick?  No, the guy was a magician.  But the show host comes over, douses his fucking head with apparently some kind of cologne  they use in Santeria, and then lit his head on fire, and the guy's head is fucking in  flames, and they're putting his head out, and his whole face was burned and shit. 
[00:34:30]  Why'd the guy do it?  I have no idea.  Let me see that, Sam.  Turn it this way.  You ain't home.  You ain't home.  Oh, shit.  I know.  I know.  It's all burning.  No.  Okay.  Fuck.  No, that caused you damage.  Wait.  Oh, my God.  Wayne, are you all right?  Your face is burned. 
[00:35:00]  He's burned.  He's burned.  Fuck.  We have to call a doctor.  A doctor.  A doctor.  Dummies.  This fucking asshole.  Put the camera down.  That's why I think it might be fake.  No, no.  It's absolutely real.  I mean, his hair was absolutely on fire, but I feel like they show his head and his  face when they pull it up, and it's not makeup or anything.  I mean, it's really burning.  Why the fuck did the guy...  People do that.  They panic when something happens. 
[00:35:30]  Plus, somewhere, there is a hard cam shot of it.  It's got to be, right?  So why isn't that online?  I don't know where it is.  I guess they don't want it online.  Look.  Look.  His hair's burnt off the top of his head, and he's all fucking...  I need to go to a hospital.  Yeah, yeah.  You're going to be fine.  A little red.  Yeah.  Shouldn't his head look a little worse than that ant?  I don't know, dude.  I don't know if this is unbelievable.  He's fucked up.  I have to go to a hospital.  I absolutely believe that happened.  Yeah, that's not how you'd play it if you were acting it. 
[00:36:00]  I have to go to a hospital.  Real quiet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess there's a lawsuit thing happening.  Oh, there is.  I hope so.  That's one where you can see the lawsuit.  Absolutely.  All right.  I guess it's real, because the guy's being prosecuted for attempted murder.  Is he?  No.  Just when that camera goes from the action to the floor is always suspicious.  What was happening right before that?  Did he say, I'm going to show you a trick?  I don't know.  Nobody really knows.  Some say it was an unscripted prank gone wrong. 
[00:36:30]  Others say it was an attempted exorcism gone wrong.  Probably the guy was going for a moment.  Like, you know, I could do this.  Yeah.  But I'll just surprise him with it.  Oh, yeah.  And then it went wrong.  It was like that prank that guy pulled in Kansas City in the parking lot.  The guy's going to teach us about great parrots.  That wasn't a prank.  No, of course not.  Yeah, we should talk about that.  You want to learn about great parrots?  Even though we fucking...  Gray parrots?  This guy's going to teach us.  Oh, I know a lot about them.  Dustin in Iowa.  All right. 
[00:37:00]  Well, when you're done, call back.  I think that's a new one.  That's a good one.  That's a new one.  Dude, I am wiped out.  You're tuckered out.  Oh, I'm tired, man.  Dustin, go ahead.  Yeah, that parrot that's singing that song, that's African Gray.  We used to own one.  And I believe he was about, oh, 57 years old, I think, when he passed away. 
[00:37:30]  57 years young.  Wow.  Young.  Sorry, sorry.  But, no, they mimicked human voice really well, and it happens over time.  You know, it's not something that they can just pick up right away.  So, for someone to teach that bird to sing that song, they had to be playing it over and  over and over.  So, they drove the gray parrot nuts, right?  What did your gray parrot used to say?  Oh.  You're African and the gray. 
[00:38:00]  He used to mimic my wife's grandpa was the original owner of him.  And if the phone would ring in the house, you would hear him say, like, hello, and he  would start mumbling words.  In fact, he's carrying on a conversation.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my dear, sweet Lord.  He just goes on and on.  I'd rather hear the parrot. 
[00:38:30]  Jeez.  You know, I'm thinking about getting a pet for my son.  Oh.  And what you learn is there's a lot of pets out there that not only will outlive me,  certainly I'm an older gentleman, will outlive most of your family.  Man, at this age, now you get him a goldfish.  Pushing a turtle.  You get him a sea turtle.  Holy fuck.  No, I'm looking at these Russian tortoises, and they live, like, 70, 80 years or whatever 
[00:39:00]  the fuck.  These parrots are living 50, 60 years.  What the hell?  What other animals are living that long?  What are you going to get them?  Yeah, because you live in a building, dude.  You could have, if you guys go away, you have a dog walker to it.  I don't know what to get him.  That's easy.  Yeah, he wants a bunny rabbit bed.  That ain't happening, obviously.  You don't have to tell me.  We'll get him a small fucking, a little.  A dumb gerbil, maybe.  A nice labradoodle.  Labradoodle.  Yeah, some adorable little thing that will yelp, and he'll love it.  Yeah, get him a bunny.  Let it hop around.  I don't want to be anchored down. 
[00:39:30]  I refuse to think I'm anchored down with two kids.  You won't be anchored down.  I think the dog will anchor me down for real.  No.  Oh, we can't go away, because who's going to watch the dog?  So many people have to deal with that.  Yeah.  Well, we can only go away for 12 hours, because who's going to watch the dog?  But those stupid cats.  I wish I didn't hate cats.  Yeah.  Because you just leave them in your...  Cats are simple.  You can leave for two weeks.  They don't even give...  Not only do they not know you're not there, they don't give a fuck. 
[00:40:00]  They don't give a fuck you're not there.  They don't care.  But a dog...  You go out just to get, like, milk.  Where were you?  I missed you.  Whenever people think cats are being affectionate when they rub on you, and it's like, oh, they  do the same thing with, like, the edge of a coffee table.  Right.  They just sit there, like, their head on it, and you think it's affectionate when it does  it to your hand.  No.  It doesn't care.  Did we talk about the video Cat Friend vs. Dog Friend on YouTube? 
[00:40:30]  Yes.  Did we talk about it on the show?  Yes, Fred.  Oh, okay, okay.  Yeah, I remember.  Did we?  I might have been off the air.  You brought it up.  Because sometimes we bring shit up off air.  I don't remember.  It's worth watching.  It might have been off air.  Really?  I know.  I don't know if we did.  They know.  Who the fuck knows?  The concept for the video is pretty damn good.  I think they fell just a bit short, but we don't have to play because it's a visual.  But if you're into cats and dogs, it's called Cat Friend vs. Dog Friend. 
[00:41:00]  And it gives you the difference if you lived, you know, with, ah, whatever.  They got over 4 million views.  No, I know.  It's going viral, this fucking thing.  I think they could have done it just a little better than they did, but the concept was great.  I'm going to start making some subpar sketches.  Yeah, I know.  I probably should do that.  So, um, fucking Belcher, what the hell happened there?  Oh, man.  He had everything to live for.  Who gives a fuck he got a shitty, shitty girlfriend or wife? 
[00:41:30]  It was his girlfriend that had a kid, but he's got all that money.  He had a charmed life, as they say.  But you know what, man?  If you're high...  He came out of West Babylon?  Doesn't even matter.  Oh, he's a Long Island guy.  He's a West Babylon guy.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, Long Island's own, man.  He played for the Chiefs, Belcher.  Oh.  I guess what I heard, his wife was out clubbing or at a concert or something, and they had  a big...  She came home late.  They had a big fucking fight.  7 a.m., yeah.  And just fucking kills her. 
[00:42:00]  Then goes to the practice facility and then fucking commits suicide.  He's talking to the GM and the coach and thanking them.  They said they didn't feel like they were in danger.  He was thanking them for what they had done for him.  But that's a guy who's not a murderer.  That's a guy who's a regular guy who might have been fucked up, who does...  That's why I don't own a gun.  Because of that guy.  Because I know that any person...  You think he was fucked up?  He might have been.  To pull a pistol and...  I think he shot her a couple times.  I don't know if he was, but it just seems like you would be when you do that. 
[00:42:30]  But that's a reaction.  That's a crazy, fucking, jealous, or whatever reaction.  Costas had a fucking spout off about gun control.  Nine times.  Oh, we got it.  Nine times.  He shot her.  Nine.  He shot her nine times?  Times.  Yeah, that's an angry relationship thing.  Yeah, yeah.  He was fucking pissed.  Not to do with gun control.  Yeah, but Costas fucking chimes in and he read a fucking article, part of an article that 
[00:43:00]  was written by some fucking...  What's his name?  Goddamn, I can't remember his name.  Some black dude.  And, yeah.  Some black dude.  Whitlock.  Whitlock.  And he actually said that he thinks if he didn't have a gun, those two would be alive  today.  So he blamed it on the fucking gun.  When the fact of the matter is, you get people like, you know, I mean, Chris Benoit is a  prime example of wiping out his family with an area a pistol be found. 
[00:43:30]  No, this guy was fucking pissed.  And if he's got that rage.  He would have absolutely strangled or did something else.  Strangled, stabbed, whatever.  That kind of rage.  No, no, no.  It's the fucking gun, dude.  And it's also, you got to get rid of bathtubs.  After what I heard Andrea Yates did, I'm like, you know what?  Bathtubs have to go.  Exactly.  And so do vans because you can back them into a lake.  Yes.  It's ridiculous.  OJ, the way he shot up those two people.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Should they have played the game yesterday? 
[00:44:00]  That was another thing that they were saying.  Well, maybe they shouldn't have, but...  Yeah, a murder took place, but then again, why not?  I mean, it sounds, not to be shallow, but...  Yeah, it is...  Like, should this one fucking asshole affect 80,000 people?  Like, you haven't something happening.  And I was annoyed for a second that they addressed it.  Because they didn't know how to address it.  So they said just the victims of domestic violence.  But then I kind of gave them a break.  I'm like, you know what?  They probably never had to deal with this before. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, no kidding.  What are you supposed to do?  They're trying to do the right thing.  They don't know how to deal with it.  Yeah.  Because the guy murdered his girlfriend, so you can't just put his picture up.  He left the kid behind, thank God.  But it just...  Now the kid's going to have a weird...  I'm not going to say shitty, but he's going to certainly have a strange life.  Having to deal with that burden.  It's just fucking...  That's terrible.  I mean...  Having to deal with your father who killed your fucking mom.  That's...  I don't know.  Wow.  Yeah, Costas was taking some shit on Twitter last night for pushing a gun control agenda 
[00:45:00]  during halftime after this episode.  I got it.  A lot of tweets.  You want to hear it?  This is Bob Costas.  Well, you knew it was coming.  In the aftermath of the nearly unfathomable events in Kansas City.  Unfathomable.  In the aftermath of the nearly unfathomable.  Unfathomable.  I turned the corner with Costas a long time ago.  I cannot fucking watch him at all.  It's terrible.  He used to be our guy, man, growing up.  And there's something about him. 
[00:45:30]  He's so unwatchable for me.  Yeah.  His statement, by the way, is quoting Whitlock's article.  Jason Whitlock, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Jason Whitlock.  It's not Costas' own words.  I mean, he obviously agrees with it.  And I'm certain NBC had to sign off on him making some gun control statement.  So, you know, whatever.  But the fact that Whitlock, and a lot of people do this, they go, well, these gun nuts.  And I was tweeting, saying, like, if you're trying to defend one of our rights, a very important right in this country, you're deemed a gun nut by a portion of the country. 
[00:46:00]  Just for trying to defend it.  I said, well, you know what?  You're a race nut.  Because he's trying to defend, you know, his race and the, what, the 13th Amendment?  How about we pull that one?  How about, you know, the Second Amendment?  Oh, it's fucking crazy.  Well, the time has passed. 
[00:46:30]  Things change.  Let's get rid of that.  How about we get rid of the 13th?  How about that?  It's become the hack argument.  It is.  Because they use it every time there's a gun murder, and the bottom line is, unless they say, have all guns removed from the planet, was this guy an illegal gun owner or illegal?  Well, the second he shot someone with it, I would assume it becomes illegal.  But I don't know, but was he a registered gun owner?  Where did he live?  In Kansas City. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  If he lived in Kansas City, he could probably buy one pretty easy in Kansas City.  So say he was a legal gun owner.  You're going to have people who own legal items use them to kill other people.  Yeah.  Like, how many domestic stabbings are there?  Or domestic strangulations?  Amazing.  Or domestic just, there's a guy on Long Island who just beat his wife to death.  It's like, come on, man.  Especially with the relationships like that and the passion crimes are always.  Yeah, the booze and the pills.  That's what you should fucking, why are they not talking about banning alcohol?  Let's say this guy was drunk. 
[00:47:30]  Are they going to talk about banning alcohol?  Right.  Fuck no.  Oh, no way.  Brings in way too much money.  Yeah.  And they also enjoy it.  The people writing the articles enjoy alcohol.  Yeah.  Of course.  So Bob Costas, I'm surprised it wasn't a pre-packaged piece.  I know, right?  With like...  Unfathomable!  With the sun slowly, you know, coming up over a football field.  Oh, yes.  A man with a dream.  I hate those packages.  Yeah, you stink.  Well, you knew it was coming.  In the aftermath of the nearly unfathomable events in Kansas City, 
[00:48:00]  that most mindless of sports cliches was heard yet again.  Something like this really puts it all in perspective.  Well, if so, that sort of perspective has a very short shelf life.  Since we will inevitably hear about the perspective we have supposedly again regained,  the next time ugly reality intrudes upon our games.  What?  Please.  Those who need tragedies to continually recalibrate their sense of proportion about sports  would seem to have little hope of ever truly achieving perspective. 
[00:48:30]  You want some actual perspective on this?  Well, a bit of it comes from the Kansas City-based writer Jason Whitlock,  with whom I do not always agree, but who today said it so well  that we may as well just quote or paraphrase from the end of his article.  Our current gun culture, Whitlock wrote,  ensures that more and more domestic disputes will end in the ultimate tragedy  and that more convenience store confrontations over loud music coming from a car  will leave more teenage boys bloodied and dead. 
[00:49:00]  Handguns do not enhance our safety.  They exacerbate our flaws, tempt us to escalate arguments,  and bait us into embracing confrontation rather than avoiding it.  In the coming days, Javon Belcher's actions  and their possible connection to football will be analyzed.  Who knows?  But here, wrote Jason Whitlock, is what I believe.  If Javon Belcher didn't possess a gun,  he and Cassandra Perkins would both be alive today. 
[00:49:30]  No.  The second half is next.  How about if she got home on time?  How about if he handled his anger differently?  How about if they had the type of relationship where they could discuss things  instead of reacting violently?  So shut the fuck up.  How about football's culture of violence  that might have affected this guy's personality  and made him do something like that?  Everyone's blaming everything.  She absolutely would not have been alive.  No, he might be alive. 
[00:50:00]  He might have hung himself.  Bernie Madoff's son hung himself,  so I guess we should ban rafters because there was a suicide.  It's such nonsense.  She would have been dead no matter what,  and most likely he would have as well.  He would have just found another way.  Yeah.  That's obvious here.  I was watching I Survived last night.  Such a fucked up show.  Yeah.  And they had a mall shooting.  They had three people that were in a mall.  This dumb fucking kid comes in with a shotgun  and just starts shooting people,  and it was their stories. 
[00:50:30]  Fucking tragic.  But this guy is talking about how he's in a card store  and he's laying on the floor trying to play dead  as this guy puts the shotgun to this girl's head  and just pulls the trigger.  And he's like, he's talking going,  and I'm just sitting there going,  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  And all I'm thinking is if one fucking person,  one legal gun owner had it,  and it's not one of these situations  where it's the movie theater  and everybody's like,  well, you don't know.  Hey, you're going to hit him. 
[00:51:00]  He's wearing body armor, this, that, or the other thing.  One guy pulls a gun out.  If that guy laying on the floor,  guaranteed, I don't care how liberal that motherfucker was,  he wanted to have a gun right then and there.  He wanted one so badly.  It's not the people.  You can't keep legislating.  You can't keep taking guns away  from people that are going to treat them responsibly.  Many days go by with the majority of gun owners  not doing one goddamn thing with their guns,  their legal guns. 
[00:51:30]  It's just another one of these easy things  for everyone to jump on.  And the gun control advocates  are some of the most misinformed people  I've ever, ever seen and had discussions with.  Discussions, you call them?  Discussions, yes.  Discussions.  Wow.  The states with less gun control  have less violent crime.  It's just, it's a stat.  It's out there.  Go to FBI.gov.  Look it up yourself. 
[00:52:00]  The states with the least gun control laws  have the least gun violence.  The ones with the strictest gun control  have the most gun crimes.  It's easy pickings when you know  that the guy that you pull a gun on  is not going to pull one back on you  because he's probably a legal,  law-abiding gentleman or lady.  And it's easy pickings.  But if you go to a state like Texas,  you pull a gun on somebody,  odds are it's going to be 
[00:52:30]  a little bit of a shootout.  So it doesn't end up like the Wild West.  It's detente.  People know not to fuck with each other.  I'll say it every time.  I went down to Dallas a few times  with Jim Norton  when we were off the air.  I couldn't believe how many fucking guns there were.  It's astounding, isn't it?  Texans love their guns.  And I love Texas.  Yeah!  And we were talking to some ladies and stuff  and they were like,  yeah, you know, I left my,  not, you know,  I left my gun in the car  because they don't have guns in this joint 
[00:53:00]  or whatever it was at the time.  But it was unbelievable  how many fucking people had guns down there.  Yeah.  Guns.  Guns.  You don't see a lot of these stories  coming out of Texas,  so I think you're making a pretty good point.  No, it's a lot of these.  As far as that goes.  It's a lot of these inner cities  that have the strictest gun control laws ever.  I mean, you look at Chicago and Detroit,  it's impossible to get yourself  a fucking carry license in those cities.  It's literally impossible. 
[00:53:30]  Yet, the gun crime,  10, dozen, 15 people shot  and killed over one weekend.  What happened?  Well, why don't we do that everywhere?  It's obviously working.  It's, no, it doesn't.  So the solution is to get a lot of guns off the streets.  Guns.  Well, they try, but you know what?  The people that, the people that,  I'm all for getting illegal guns  out of the hands of these fucking savages 
[00:54:00]  that don't know how to use them,  are killing innocent children  and old grannies on the side of the road  sitting on their little porches and whatnot.  But, you know, there's no way to do it.  It's illegal.  People are constantly using things  they're not supposed to have  for committing crimes.  Is it true some of these towns,  it's a law where you have to own a gun?  I've heard about this over the years.  I've heard about that, but I've never lived  in one of these places. 
[00:54:30]  We got one of these guys on the phone right now,  and I have heard this shit over the,  over the, I said it already.  Go ahead, John.  Hey, Anthony.  Hey, Jamie.  Hey.  Here we got a little town outside of Atlanta,  Kennesaw, Georgia.  By law, you have to own a gun to live there.  Really?  Kennesaw.  Wonderful city.  Sounds nice.  Is it a terrible place, or is it nice?  Oh, it's beautiful, beautiful.  A lot of history.  Why is that the law?  Because I think they had a really,  pretty bad, violent murder in the 70s, 
[00:55:00]  and they figured, hey, let's get the word out.  Don't come knocking on our fucking doors  unless you mean business.  I guess they figure an armed populace  puts people in that position  where they won't try to rob somebody.  Hey, if you knew everyone in a town had a gun,  would you break into their home?  Absolutely.  I love a challenge.  Have a good one, boys.  Thank you.  So, a few people saying Belcher was drinking 
[00:55:30]  and on pills, pain pills.  Well, I guess what we got to do is ban alcohol.  You don't hear that?  Every time there's a drunk driving accident,  by the way, you hear about legislation,  and you hear about tougher control  on abuse of alcohol,  but not one of these dumb motherfuckers  comes out and says, ban alcohol.  Well, now I'm in on the discussion, obviously,  because so many more people die  because of alcohol than guns.  Yes.  And I don't want alcohol to be banned, trust me, 
[00:56:00]  but it just points out the hypocrisy  of the whole fucking thing.  And alcohol, honestly, really, think about it,  has no redeeming quality whatsoever.  No, I think...  It's really nothing.  I think.  We all know at least one person  who has died because of alcohol.  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  Period.  Yeah, yeah.  Every single one of us.  Everyone hearing our voice.  Yeah.  That is a major problem in this country.  Way worse than fucking guns.  Yeah.  But it's just interesting when...  But they're not going to tackle that issue  because it's way too complicated  and it brings in way too much fucking money. 
[00:56:30]  And they enjoy it.  And they enjoy it.  You know, add that to it.  You're right.  Themselves.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Because it's just a funny way  of looking at things.  Like, when you look at guns,  when you hear about a shooting like this,  this one group will always come out  and go,  Get rid of guns!  A gun's a gun nut!  Instead of just going,  Look, we need all illegal guns  taken off the street.  They don't seem to concentrate  on just the part of illegal guns.  Yeah.  They want to legislate  against honest gun owners  and responsible gun owners.  But I would love to hear them  try that shit  with every time 
[00:57:00]  there's a drunk-driving family  killed.  Got to get all alcohol  off this.  Never.  You're never going to fucking hear it.  Bob Costas.  And they were just talking about  I do not always agree.  A friend saying  he had head injuries  that perhaps  put him in this mental state  from football.  That's, oh,  well,  we got banned football.  That's crazy.  How about Bob, you know,  says we need to ban football.  Oh, that's right.  Ban that football.  He makes a good living. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  From football.  Just, I like pointing out  just the hypocrisy  of the whole thing.  If the guy's on,  if he was drinking  and he's on some kind  of medication  for his head shit,  that's a lethal combination  right there.  Then you throw a gun into it,  sure,  made it a little easier,  sure,  but I think he was going  to get the job done  no matter what.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No matter what.  Yeah,  that's one of those  crimes of passion  where you either  beat the fucking piss  out of someone  or stab them 80 times. 
[00:58:00]  That guy did  what this guy  in Long Island just did.  Guy just,  I think it was Long Island  just beat his wife to death.  That's what this guy  would have done.  I watch a lot of them  crime shows,  you know?  A lot of them  crime shows  on Discovery  and things like that.  And it's amazing  when they show  the wife  and, oh,  someone broke in  and stabbed her  80 times.  Nothing was taken.  And I could just  change the channel  right there.  A key was found  in the door.  Yeah.  It's like,  all right,  we know who did this. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah,  strangers don't just  write cunt  and lipstick  on the way.  Yes.  There's a thing  guys will do  to their girlfriends  or wives  when they kill them  and that is  fuck them up.  If they have a gun  or not,  they're still  going to do it.  It's that rage  that's doing it,  not the hardware.  Yeah.  All right.  We should break.  Oh.  We got some  things to do today.  Yes.  And we'll do  those things  next day.  All right.  Oh. 
[00:59:00]  Sirius XM.  You're listening  to O.B. and Anthony.  Jimmy's missing this.  Oh, man.  How's his birthday?  64, huh?  Yes.  You want to talk music.  33 years ago today.  33.  What year is that? 
[00:59:30]  12,  12,  then you got to 21,  right?  So 79.  Wow.  1979.  79.  79.  79.  That was this song?  No.  Oh.  No,  I just segned it  to more music news.  Oh.  We're doing our music news break.  What happened in 19...  Who, who?  Who, who?  Something to do with the who, who?  The who, who?  Who, who?  I would say the tragic loss of Mr. Keith Moon. 
[01:00:00]  No.  All right.  That happened before 79, I believe.  Yes.  79.  Who, who?  Oh, uh-oh.  Oh, yeah.  It's tragic news.  Oh, yeah.  Was that Cincy?  Cincy, right.  Yes, a little trampling.  Cincinnati is known for Pete Rose and people getting trampled.  That's it.  That's all I know about Cincinnati after all these years.  33 years ago, 11 people crushed to death at the Who concert. 
[01:00:30]  I remember that.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Damn, yo.  Huh?  Where's Z-Rock?  He's, uh, he's got another day off.  Taking a day for himself.  For the foreseeable future?  No, he's got a little vacay today, and then he's back for the rest of the week, and I think  he's got a couple other days before Christmas break.  Four-day weekend he took.  Mm-hmm.  What did, uh, he do?  Can I say something?  Certainly.  Sure, please do.  And, and, and, see that name?  See that name?  Thank you.  And I don't want, I don't want the staff mad, because it's not about them, I swear to you. 
[01:01:00]  Uh-huh.  But I'm going to say this.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I had a kid.  Mm-hmm.  I took two days off since October.  Mm-hmm.  Iraq's been gone, how many days?  We should leave right now.  You really did only take two days for your baby.  Yeah.  I took two days for the birth of my daughter.  And, and, and honestly, the company was cool.  They're like, take as much time as you want.  We understand.  Man, contrary to popular belief, Iraq's not pregnant, though.  But don't tell her that you took more time for your son, because that's that sibling 
[01:01:30]  shit that will never go away.  Like, don't let her know that you took a week for your son and then two days for her.  Did I take a week for her?  I think so, yeah.  Yeah, you did.  Hudson?  Yeah, she'll feel slighted.  Mm.  Well, it was right around when we were signing and all that crap, so it was, it was, I just  said, all right, I needed, I think it was two, it might have been three.  Two or three days, that's it.  Sex man's got his days.  But how, how was, don't hate the play, I hate the game.  How many days has he taken since October?  Quite a few.  He's taken more days than I. 
[01:02:00]  I think he gave himself Thanksgiving week off.  He gave himself Thanksgiving week.  He did.  As a matter of fact, he gave himself.  No, it's just funny that he gave himself.  Right.  He gave himself the Friday before Thanksgiving week and then all Thanksgiving week.  And I understand you guys all have days.  I understand that.  Right.  But if I, if I bring up the real issue, then you guys are going to get mad and all that.  What's the real issue?  Talk to me.  No, just that they make you come here when we're not here.  That's stupid.  Well, we give ourselves a little vacation every now and then.  Yeah, you got to. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, but the thing is, I'll shut up because I don't want to put you guys in a bad spot.  What do you mean a bad spot?  Oh, no.  Huh?  Well, you're not going to put us in a bad spot because if I was in your position and if  the show hosts were gone, I would absolutely want to come to work and just hang out.  Yeah, but.  Right.  That would be a cool hang.  It's perfect.  Jim, oh, my God.  I'm not right here.  The thing is.  That's a big bag, too.  He could be doing that for hours.  We got to figure out.  Yeah.  What's going on? 
[01:03:00]  I'm just chewing baby carrots.  You're a little baby carrots.  He rock does work hard.  Just sometimes he needs a little brake ski.  You guys all work hard.  Brake ski.  You missed your Ozzy song.  Ozzy 64.  Oh, I got a tweet of a happy birthday.  What song did you play?  We went.  Crazy Train.  We went obscure.  Obscure.  We went deep with that one.  Very deep.  A little Crazy Train.  Yep.  You want me to play something different?  No, stop.  It's fine.  We can have a whole Ozzy day.  Every time we come back. 
[01:03:30]  It's fine.  I'm just fucking around.  I know you are.  I don't mean.  Different birthday song.  I don't mean 90.  I would say I don't mean 90% of this shit.  90%.  Oh, yeah.  I don't give a fuck.  That makes you a liar.  I don't mean most of this shit.  Happy birthday to you.  Ringo Starr released You're 16 39 years ago.  Get away with it back then.  You're 16.  You're beautiful.  And you're mine. 
[01:04:00]  Whoa.  Really?  Wow.  What are you trying to say there?  And I get bitched at.  He wrote a fucking song about it.  Jesus Christ.  That broad would be 55 years old now.  You come on like a dream.  Peaches and cream.  Lips that.  Look at.  Look at.  Look at him.  You're 16.  16.  You're beautiful.  And you're mine.  You're mine.  Is that to his daughter?  No.  Oh.  Oh.  He's talking about licks like strawberry wine. 
[01:04:30]  You're 16.  Oh.  You're beautiful.  And you're mine.  Oh.  Now what comes up?  Roll over and shut up.  Oh.  You're my baby.  You're my pet.  Pet.  We fell in love.  Fell in love.  I licked my sweaty balls.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ha ha.  Ooh.  When we kissed.  Yeah.  I'm going to fuck you in the mouth.  Ha ha. 
[01:05:00]  Do you suck dicks?  Ha ha ha.  I'm going to come down your throat.  You fucking well better swallow it.  And you're mine.  Hey everybody.  We're all going to get laid.  Ha ha ha.  Stop talking and start sucking.  Ha ha ha.  Hey.  What about the cheeks of my ass?  Ha ha ha.  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time. 
[01:05:30]  Oh.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had.  And I've had him all over the world.  Yes.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  And we kiss.  I could not stop.  You walk out of my dream.  I need to my cup.  Hey.  Didn't Iraq take some time for Hurricane Sandy too?  Going to jail.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He gave himself a little time.  Yeah.  He gave himself a little time for that as well.  Because of the twig in his throat.  Remember the twig?  Yeah.  Almost as bad as a eyepatch kid. 
[01:06:00]  People have different ways of recovering from different things.  I hear ya.  Yeah.  He gave himself some time for Sandy.  I hear ya.  Who am I to say?  Thanksgiving was a big holiday in the Nagel house.  So he had to give himself several days off for that.  And then with all the excitement of Christmas, he's not going to be at work every day leading  up to it.  And speaking of Christmas, we're expecting a lot of gifts this year.  Yes.  Hey.  Past years, we just sit here and we're like, yeah, if they want to give us gifts, that's  cool.  But this year, we're absolutely expecting gifts.  And today's gift is the Pure Monster Sound.  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  Is this Plugola?  No.  It's for the Monsters Made for Veterans Day to help the vets.  It's at Best Buy.  Digital cam.  Wait.  What happened?  It's made for veterans.  What do you mean a digital camera?  No, no, no.  It's a digital camo.  That's the...  Oh, camo.  Yeah.  That's the pattern on it.  It's limited edition.  Limited edition!  Are these good headphones?  Yeah.  It still sounds like Plugola to me.  What are you talking about?  This is for the veterans, Sam.  Yeah.  The veterans.  The veterans. 
[01:07:00]  The veterans.  Huh?  It's not Veterans Day.  Huh?  It's not Veterans Day.  I heard you.  It's not Veterans Day.  I know, but he wants gifts.  I like free stuff.  He wants gifts.  This is the only gift we got today?  Free stuff rules.  Well, the Dark Knight Blu-rays are coming in for you guys.  Is there any deleted scenes or stuff with Heath Ledger that wasn't shown?  Oh, no, no.  This is Dark Knight Rises.  Oh, how come they didn't have any of that?  Was there not one deleted scene for fucking Heath Ledger?  Or there's not one?  Yeah.  The rest of his life.  You know, the movie where Batman should have died.  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:07:30]  Especially because Chris Nolan wasn't making any more Batman movies.  Why wouldn't you kill off Batman and piss everybody off?  Did he not?  Oh, the third one.  Yeah.  Well, because now who's got the Batman series?  So they're going to start their own thing.  So you end your thing with killing Batman.  That's a big, holy fuck, they killed Batman.  Why couldn't they do that, Roland?  Because then they'll make money.  Gotham would be in such a trouble.  They set it up like they killed Batman.  You know, he's taken off.  He certainly did.  You know, it's not going to end well.  But he's okay.  And then they have to show you that he's okay. 
[01:08:00]  Yeah.  I would have killed Batman.  Oh.  Batman's going to be okay.  Chris Nolan had nothing to lose.  Yeah.  Spoilers.  Shut up.  Spoilers.  Oh, my God.  Right.  So what's the big plugola for this?  No, just pure monster sound.  Oh, God.  Headphones with what?  The camo design?  Well, the camo is a limited edition.  Limited edition for the veterans?  Yeah.  I mean, if you're a best buy, you can pick it up.  But I'm not going to say those things.  What has this turned into?  Plug a hole.  It's for Christmas.  You said it was for Veterans Day. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, you are.  You made them for veterans.  But it looks like there's a monster pure sound.  I don't think satellite radio is regulated like regular radio.  So I think we could openly ask for shit.  I didn't ask for it.  I'll try it.  If it's a good product, I'll tell you it's a good product.  I mean, that's the only way.  I'm not going to fucking say it's a good product.  If it's not, let's say pay me.  I think we've got to be consumer advocates so we get to try shit.  You're frustrating the sales department.  Why?  To no end.  Why?  What?  They haven't sold anything. 
[01:09:00]  We have one sponsor.  They have fucking asshole cream ads for us.  After all these years?  How are they pissed off?  What, somebody wake them up before 10?  We don't have sponsors?  We have people that advertise every once in a while.  That's not a real sponsor.  Steven Singer is our only sponsor.  Did anybody hear anything from us?  We used to have fucking beer companies and everything else.  Oh, yeah.  Did Steven Singer talk to Scott Greenstein?  Not that I know of. 
[01:09:30]  I don't think he really did.  I bet not.  Is Gary going to take on the green room situation?  We can't have Ray Liotta sitting in our office.  Ryan Reynolds did.  Who?  Ryan Reynolds.  What do you think, Jimmy?  Should Ray Liotta be sitting in our office?  He shouldn't even be in our studio.  You're putting Liotta and Ryan Reynolds in the same category?  No, but he's saying that they're...  Why am I defending you?  You're kidding.  They're both A-listers, Ant.  They really are.  Look.  Ryan Reynolds.  He's A-lister. 
[01:10:00]  It's just because of who he was.  I can't hear a fucking thing you're saying.  You put the headphones on.  Yes, I have them on.  And I feel like I'm deaf.  Why wouldn't he plug them in?  Oh, wow.  Why would you plug them in?  Plug them into the console.  Oh, I thought these were just earmuffs.  I thought he was crunching his carrots.  And you can't hear how obnoxious that is.  So, could someone tell Gary that Steven Singer, of all people, made a very good point? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  And we need a place for the A-listers to go instead of our shitty office?  Now or after the show?  You know, the shitty office they gave us that me and Ant decided never to use.  Never to ever use.  I've given you guys twice the space, by the way, and you never, ever thanked me for that.  They were going to shove you guys all in that one tiny fucking office.  Because I'm not in that office.  The only reason you guys got space is because we decided not to use the one they gave to us.  But Eric sits in that office now, so there is no extra space. 
[01:11:00]  No, it's Eric, Sal, and myself.  In what?  Me and Ants?  Yeah.  Space?  Yeah, so it's three.  Why don't we take over our office?  Yeah.  Do it.  For what?  I kick these guys out.  Let them know exactly where we are at any given moment to come in and fucking meet with us?  So Gary's got to take care of the green room situation.  How many years?  You think it'll be?  Before it's done?  Yeah.  Not this contract.  No?  No, no, no.  You won't have a green room by the end of this contract.  Space.  We just signed. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  No, you won't have a green room.  You can't have the likes of Ray Liotta sitting in the office.  He could stand outside the studio if you want.  Yeah.  I put him in the hallway sometimes, in the lobby.  We got some desk chairs outside the studio.  He could sit in one of those.  And when will that wall be knocked down?  Roger Moore sat in Eric's chair.  He goes, oh, this chair feels weird awkward.  You think he was looking at the Bikini Girl screensaver?  Oh, man. 
[01:12:00]  He was fidgety on the chair.  He goes, what kind of chair is this?  They kept on moving around.  You can't have Roger Moore sitting in E-Rock's chair.  E-Rock's chair.  Great.  Looking at E-Rock's computer.  Oh, my God.  You just can't do that.  Why did he call it a chair?  A chair.  A chair.  He wouldn't probably say it.  Oh, no, it wasn't Sean Connery.  Sean Connery would say a chair.  A chair.  Yeah, but we could, yeah, if there's a problem with the chairs, we could just have him stand.  All right.  Yeah.  And as far as the wall coming down, that wall's not coming down.  Whoa.  Why not?  Dolphin biting the kid's hand. 
[01:12:30]  Holy shit.  You see, the kid is all in pain.  Oh.  So now they got to kill the dolphin, right?  Oh, of course.  Got to shoot that thing in the face.  Yeah.  A little bottlenose.  We need our dolphins to behave.  Yeah.  I think if one of these animals goes wild at the zoo, you got to fucking let the animal live.  That's what they do.  That's all they do.  Their brains are wired for that shit.  It's like, they show the kid's face like, ow!  Let me see the video.  Look at this thing comes up and fucking nails the kid. 
[01:13:00]  It's hilarious.  Poor thing.  Why so many dislikes on the video?  They're mad at the dolphin.  Are they mad at the dolphin?  Super pissed.  Or are they mad at the kid for being so delicious?  That fucking dolphin.  They're pissed at SeaWorld?  Yep.  Yeah.  PETA doesn't like the fact that they do that.  Scary moment at SeaWorld Orlando.  Eric's hometown.  Hi.  I'm feeding the little dolphins.  Good job, buddy.  Did you touch him yet, James?  Oh, boy. 
[01:13:30]  Oh, look out.  Look out.  You got to touch him underneath.  Oh, shit.  Can I help you?  Don't tell him.  I'm out of fish.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Oh, no, stupid.  You don't hold the thing.  Shitty kid.  I just want to film and see what your hand looks like.  Yeah, film it for the lawsuit, honey.  That's what the father's saying.  I'm not going to show it to anybody.  Wow.  That's great.  Nice dolphin bite.  It's like a cat scratch. 
[01:14:00]  Soak it in salt water.  Oh.  See, I'm torn.  I think it's hilarious.  Shows her hand.  But if that happened to my kid, I would jump in and strangle the dolphin.  Here's a slow motion.  Look at the kid's face.  It's like, yeah.  Well, she wasn't looking, right?  But he didn't even lift the hand off.  He could have.  She was holding something in her hand.  Oh, look.  Thank God it didn't pull her in the water.  It's only a matter of time before someone gets seriously injured at this attraction.  How about if you're holding fish over a dolphin, you just look at the dolphin?  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  You better be paying attention to the dolphin. 
[01:14:30]  The dolphin's like, what the fuck?  Give me the fish.  Give me that fucking fish.  That's all it's thinking.  Hey, you little girl.  We like thinking that dolphins are just like us, only in the water.  They're that smart.  But they're not.  They're all based on food.  Yeah, but if you were starving and some little girl was like, you'd be like, give me that  fucking candy bar.  Because they make sure the dolphins are a little hungry, honestly.  I hate this graphic.  Thank God it didn't pull her in the water.  The dolphin was not going to pull her in the water.  All he wanted was the fish that she was not giving him.  Pull her in the water and then give her a ride on his back.  That's right.  And go, eww, eww. 
[01:15:00]  And then do that thing they do on their tail.  It's a door blast.  Door boom.  Love dolphins.  That's pretty funny.  Yeah, everybody's saying the dolphin didn't attack anyone.  Animals acting like an animal.  Blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, the dolphin didn't do anything wrong there.  Whatsoever.  What does PETA say?  Are they having women undressed for this?  Yes.  Wendy Williams is getting new.  PETA's fucking amazing, isn't it?  Hey, we saved the animals.  Let me get naked.  I still got to say thumbs down to Wendy Williams, especially with that fucking PETA ad. 
[01:15:30]  She's a giant.  Wendy Williams is a fucking fatty.  She's a giant.  She's not a fatty.  She's just large.  She's a man.  If you didn't know about her, you would say she was a tranny.  I'm sorry.  She gave me the dirty look.  She knows who we are.  She came by the studio and gave us the dirty look.  She could have came in here.  Look at them fucking giant tits.  She's a giant.  She is a giant.  She's a big, big lady.  She looks ridiculous in sweaters.  Yeah.  I said it.  It didn't really go anywhere.  But there's like a Herman Munster feel to her. 
[01:16:00]  Especially when Herman Munster used to dress up like women.  Hilarious.  I know this is like such an old reference.  Oh, yeah.  That's what I see when I see Wendy Williams.  That was great.  He'd have to dress like a chick for some reason.  Because they just wanted a storyline where they had Herman as a fucking chick.  And remember he had the giant, awkward boobs?  Yeah.  That's what she looks like.  Find Herman Munster as a woman.  I'm not giving up on this concept that she kind of looks like that. 
[01:16:30]  Herman Munster.  How are the headphones?  They're good.  I'm just responding to some cocksucker troll on Twitter.  Really?  There's trolls on Twitter?  That's fucked up.  What could you possibly upset that upsets somebody?  Are they people that have the original egg and only have like fucking...  He has eight followers.  Eight followers and only tweets to you?  Yeah.  Does that happen?  No, he has no egg.  No egg.  No.  No egg?  Some guy yesterday was bitching.  I was saying some shit.  He had 250 followers and 10,000 tweets. 
[01:17:00]  Wow.  So I said, you're talking to no one.  I go, you don't exist.  And then, oh, that measures like who you are is how many followers.  He's like, you didn't even get the point.  That's not the point.  It doesn't matter.  When you have 250 followers and 10,000 tweets, you're not talking to anybody.  It's the old tree falling in the fucking forest and no one's there to hear it or see it or something.  I don't know what happens.  If you're talking that much to that few people, you're a bore. 
[01:17:30]  You're right.  Just looking at that Ivanka Trump.  Oh, my God.  She's all right, huh?  She's a fucking bitch.  She grew into her chin.  Or the chin grew into her face, I think.  She's beautiful.  Yeah, she's absolutely beautiful.  I'd love to marry into the Trump family.  I'd agree with the Donald.  Good point, Donald.  You'd think you'd be in situations like that.  Every 10 minutes, I'm telling you, the president got, you're right, you're right.  Because she is beautiful and they're fucking rich.  She is beautiful.  She's a fucking knockout. 
[01:18:00]  I absolutely would marry her and just tolerate him and just yes him to death.  Yeah.  What you got to do is you got to get all the money and the president.  Yeah, you're right.  Good point, Don.  Good point.  Can you pass the mash?  Yeah, can you pass the mash?  Oh, God.  Pass the mash.  Just don't fire me, Dad.  No, because he didn't show that version to him.  I know.  Really?  I just finished Penn Jillette's book.  It was a terrific read and he has a whole thing on his time on Celebrity Apprentice. 
[01:18:30]  It's worth reading.  Yeah?  Oh, he just calls it what it is.  Complete and utter nonsense.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  Horse shit.  And he made a deal with the producers and Donald Trump himself that he would just go  along with the show as they're filming it.  Yeah.  But he knew halfway through that it was just horse shit.  Complete and utter horse shit.  It's a good read.  Don't want to give it away in case you got that book.  I like the Penn Jillette.  Yeah, Penn's good.  He's a good egg. 
[01:19:00]  So the Who, yeah, 11 people were crushed.  That's where we were.  Who, who, who?  And Ringo Starr with his, uh, year 16.  Do we have any tissue?  Yeah, beautiful.  I think there's one worse song than that.  Not a fucking napkin, Sam.  Sorry, Ant.  Oh, Underage, uh, Underage Girls?  Young Girl, it's called.  Yeah, that old, uh, Gary Puckett and the Union Gap song.  That one's just like, Jesus, that's a creepy, uh, song.  Well, we, we kind of did this break.  Yeah.  You talked about that one and I think I talk about Benny Mardonis, was it? 
[01:19:30]  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, we did do this break, right.  Right.  Because we were trying to figure out which one was the creepiest song of all.  The creepiest song.  As far as singing about underage girls.  Yeah, there was, um.  Benny Mardonis is up there.  I think it's Mardonis.  My Sharona.  No.  Yeah, it is.  No, it's not.  Stop.  My scrotum.  That was Cheech and Chong.  My scrotum.  That's all I think of when I hear that song. 
[01:20:00]  I remember My Bologna.  I'm sorry.  Oh, that was, uh.  My Bologna.  Yes.  The creepiest little girl song.  Yes.  Could you give me a little Benny Mardonis?  Probably, uh.  Which one is that?  Do you know the name of the song?  Oh, I want to say Into the Night or something like that.  Yeah, Into the Night is a big song.  Yeah, that's it.  Hit it, Sam, if you got it.  Or whoever's got it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, listen to the lyrics, man.  Oh.  You got some underage shit going down in this song. 
[01:20:30]  You could have started there.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, boy. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah, this is a good one.  So everyone knows it's wrong.  Right off the bat.  Rated by fools  Who don't know what love is yet  Don't know what love is yet  Oh boy  Check his hard drive  And show you a love  Like you've never seen  Holy shit 
[01:21:30]  This was in the gold category at BAB  How old is the girl?  You get to pick a gold song every once in a while  She's just 16 years old  It's a good song  Leave her alone  What's the next one?  He's got to hide  Hides a heart  Yeah, he's got to hide a heart  A little sauce salami  People are giving him shit 
[01:22:00]  And we get done  Yeah  Certain times his voice sounds a little like Steve Perry  Really?  Not the whole time  I think when he goes like  Lift you up  He gets this like gravelly  I didn't really listen to this  In the chorus  A little bit  Nothing to compare it to 
[01:22:30]  Yeah  But I want you to know  If I could fly  I'd pick you up  I'd take you into the night  And fly you to a hotel room  And eat your teenage asshole  While the cops looked in the wrong town  I'd fly you to Thailand 
[01:23:00]  Where it'll be legal to fuck your ass mouth and cunt  How do you do this song?  How do you write this song?  You get faded out  And not like come off as a creep  I guess he would argue that he was writing it from the perspective of like an 18 year old or something  Oh, is that it?  I would imagine  Well then what about Young Girl by Gary Puckett?  You're just six years old  Oh no 
[01:23:30]  It's a marvelous song  Young Girl  Yeah  Girl  Yeah, this is really creepy  Get out of my mind  Oh boy  Oh boy  Better run  It's telling her to run  You're much too younger  And then he goes into the details of  With all the charms of a woman  She's got the charms of a woman 
[01:24:00]  But uh-oh, wait a minute  You've kept the secret of your youth  Oh, she might have been bullshitting him  And then finally came forward  You let me into  Believe you're old enough  To give me love  And now it hurts to know  Oh, he finally  She finally went there too  And I'm 16  Oh, fuck  Alright  Or maybe  He didn't even say 16, right?  So he's trying to do the right thing 
[01:24:30]  She was the one saying  She was the one saying that she was older than she is  Yeah  Wow  It's the bitches that'll get you  Yeah  That's a good one  This gets  Wait a minute  Beneath your perfume and makeup  Oh boy  There's no hair on your pussy  Yeah  Oh  It was just a baby in disguise  I smell like desitin  And though you never

[01:49:30]  On regular radio  And if we can't  On satellite radio  Announce something  As songs from an offensive  Song contest  It's like  The whole fucking thing  Is sunk  It's just because  Like when it's taken  Out of context  Oh yeah  Then that's where  It gets crazy  And they played  This song  Right  And then they don't  Put it in the context  That we played  Something ten years old  From an offensive  Song contest  That's what you gotta  Worry about  What we're doing  Is fine  Yeah ten years  It was ten years ago  Oh look back  Offensive song contest  But you know 
[01:50:00]  Then people take it  Out of context  That's true  And no one listens  To what we're  No one cares  About the excuse  Travis you weren't  Around back then  Are you a little nervous  No  Oh good  No not really  What's the next one  Well the last three  All deal with the Holocaust  So we have Schindler's List  Who's next  Would you like to hear it  What are the other two  Sure  Stuck in an Oven  Oh that was  Viva Dash Auschwitz  Viva Dash Auschwitz  If we're gonna do  One of them  Stuck in the Oven  Was done to  Stuck in the Middle  Was that what it was  We didn't hear My Age

[01:51:00]  Now was that part of 
[01:51:30]  The Most Offensive Song Contest  Or was that just  Thrown in the file  I don't remember  I don't remember that song  From the actual contest  That was so good  I thought that was  Actually Elvis  Because he introduced it  The way Elvis  Introduced my way  Yeah yeah yeah  Steve from Bayshore  Does an amazing Elvis  Great Elvis  But I don't think  That was part of the contest  I think that was  We just threw that  In the same folder  Oh okay  I believe  Probably  Steve's out there  I mean what's the deal  With that  Oh yeah maybe  That was newer  Give me the next one there  Schindler's List  Sure  Well it's 1944 
[01:52:00]  The Reich that's pissed  Poland's invaded  By the Nazi blitz  And although you had you  Yeah you won't get this  They got your name on  Schindler's List  Granny's gone  Brother Joe  But wait  No reason to cut your wrist  Yeah you're gonna live  Now you get the gist  Dot your name on  Schindler's List  You might have been 
[01:52:30]  Sent to Auschwitz  Very good  He gave it that  Old 40's feel  Didn't it  I'm thinking we should  Just do a song parody  Contest in general  Yeah  The whole jingle contest  Worked so well  They can pick whatever  They want  Associated with this show  Oh  What do you think  Or  Make it offensive  Too  Is it about the show  Or is it about  I think we make it  A little more  Just broader  In general  I like offensive

[01:53:30]  Two more yeah  Stuck in an oven  And then Viva  Doc Auschwitz  What year was this  By the way  Do you remember  I would guess  Around 2001ish  Yeah  Down there  Maybe not  Because that live gig  I would say 2000  So we were about  Two years into  Our four year stint  We only did four years  That was it  No  We only made  Four years at  NEW  We've got a lot  Done though  We've been here  Eight years  Yeah  Alright Travis  Well I'm not sure

[01:55:00]  I'm ready to pull  So stack them corpses high  There's a thousand choking women  Stuff tied in there  They're barely breathing  Cyclone bees in the air  I'm just a furor  With bullets to spare  So  Viva das Auschwitz  Viva das Auschwitz  He's so good  Let me get this straight  He paints houses  What is he doing?  He's a talented fucking dude man  He really is 
[01:55:30]  This is what you should be doing  For a living  Then the reds were knocking on my door  And you can fuck around  With the songs a little bit too  Viva jackboots  And all bands  And those shirts of brown  10,000 Nazi flags  In every town  Come on stupid bitches  Let's all go step around  Viva das Auschwitz  God damn  Viva das Auschwitz  Viva das Auschwitz  With your burning ovens  And your fruit  He uh  Wow

I don't know  It's hard to make a living  Sing an Elvis song somewhere  And it's easy  Painting houses  Or whatever he does  But he also can play it up  He looks great  In an Elvis outfit  He fucking fits the part perfectly  I think he would look good  On an Elvis toilet  I mean  He needs to drop a few  But see  He's very talented  That's what you should be doing  People would hire you  For a little Elvis set  And then you can have fun with it

[02:01:00]  I don't know this  Believer off Diamond Mad Men  All right  Brazi  64 today  So good  You know this song  I said it to Jimmy like  You know this song 
[02:01:30]  Yeah  When he was just touring  On Blizzard of Oz  Before this album came out  Time  Time  And feeling the name  Rise up from the Oz  This is a unique voice  Ozzy Oz  You know it's Ozzy  When you hear Ozzy  Ozzy Ozzy  Yeah  Nothing better than the  Air and Air  Yeah 
[02:02:00]  That's been great  Air and Air  Air and Air  They're painting the hallways around here  Yes  Is that what they're doing?  I saw they painted the  What you call the  Batchroom door  Gotta watch when you open up  The bathroom  What does that mean usually?  They wanna put your  Oh really?  Yeah  Gotta use the nab  What does that mean  When they put a fresh coat of paint  On something?  Uh  Hmm  You're looking for that hidden  There's a new company coming in  Usually you shine something up 
[02:02:30]  A little before you get rid of it  Right?  You sell it  You kinda  Make it all nice  That last bit of goodness  Out of it  Yeah  Yeah  A coat of paint on it  The hallways have been very quiet lately  When is Liberty taking over officially?  Liberty  Sam you know everything  Yeah I don't know 100% when Liberty is taking over  But definitely like you said  I mean those bathrooms are so freshly painted and everything  There's new urinal cakes in the urinals  What?  Yeah  What the hell?  Sounds delicious  They're bright blue  They're the color of my sweatshirt 
[02:03:00]  They're beautiful  Yeah  They smell better  Yeah  By the way I remembered another pedo song  Oh  That is not a parody  It's a real song  It's a motorhead  Daddy don't touch me  Oh jeez  Don't let daddy touch me  I think it's called  Really?  Don't let daddy kiss me  Don't let daddy kiss me  Goodnight  It's a really  Sleeping in dreams of peace  Mommy's been gone a long time  Daddy comes home and she still sleeps 
[02:03:30]  Waiting for the world's worst crime  And he comes up the stairs like he always does  He has to make an acoustic  This is  This is Lemmy's Beth  And then she's whining out  Scared to death  She smells his lust  Then she smells his sweat  Killed in a bowl  She holds the breath  Praying to her God  That she's never made  Okay  Don't let daddy kiss me 
[02:04:00]  Don't let daddy kiss me  It's a shame  Because the guitar work is beautiful  I love this  But this could have been like  Beth  Is there a lighter song?  This is the one where you're like  Yeah this is the love ballad  Swaying back and forth  Yeah this is where you turn  You fucking flick your lighter  Why didn't this make a power ballad disc? 
[02:04:30]  Because every bad boy has its creepy side  His voice sounds great in this  The guitar works great  Too bad they didn't reconsider this whole song  Let me argue  That's funny  They steal her daddy  And they steal her home  And it's not so bad  When daddy leaves her alone 
[02:05:00]  Praying to her God  With his heart of stone  What a fucking lovely song that is  Wow  Don't let daddy kiss me  Don't let daddy kiss me  I hate that one  Oh dude I bet you do  Yeah  Alright we gotta go back to Playboy Radio  People are waiting  So  Where do they play that?

He looks like a Ramone so you'd know if you saw him  He's down by  He sits in like the cubicles down by the break room  By Ellis' guy I think  I always just see him talking about him  You walk by and you go  Ramone  No I don't  I walk by and go  Somebody  Somebody put something in my drink  Somebody  And I say it that loud 
[02:06:30]  In just that part  He's the last  How old are beasts that did it?  He's the last of the Ramones  Which is key to this  They're all dead  And Jessica Hall  Asked Marky this  This is a Playboy's party  So anything goes here  We talk about sex  Relationships  Lie-hearted  Whatever  And you guys have that online meet and greet  Happening this Friday  At 6pm  Meet, curtain, and greet  No that was last Friday  That's just a little taste  Of how she intros her show  And her level of preparedness  Terrific 
[02:07:00]  Yeah  Something tells me  This is gonna be an embarrassing question  No no it's alright  It's alright  You know what's weird about the Ramones  Like years ago  When they were you know  Kind of new  You see an interview with him  And you expect it to hear like  I don't want any fucking thing  We're a punk band  And fuck it  And it's like  Yeah how you doing  How you doing  It's like your fucking neighbor  Right  Just some fucking New York accent  Yeah  Yeah  Don't you love how ugly  Joey Ramone was  And how great  Like that's such a beautiful thing  To be such a big  Suckerfish  A big lummox 
[02:07:30]  Yeah he was a big dolt  But just fucking  What an amazing live performer he was  Just standing there  He really isn't  I wish I loved the Ramones longer  Rag rag rag rag rag  I'm a high ski  I don't care about history  Rag rag rag rag  That's not where I wanna be  He would do that fucking weird thing  With his voice  But they're so good  Yeah I like the Ramones  Of course they are  Ooh I don't care about history Robin  Let's have a Howard look 
[02:08:00]  They would hate that we're playing this one  This is not one I even like  I think We're a Happy Family  Is my favorite Ramones song  I like this  Yeah  Ah PJ Souls  Fucking fish man  Showing how old he is  I don't know that movie  Remember Rock and Roll High School  God you would swear that's Howard too  Yeah  So weird  Young Howard  PJ Souls was in Stripes

I mean  And it's December 3rd  Sam stop  Are you  Are you ever looking like  When he does things  To just go like  I want to fucking  Like  Like I'm waiting for him to fuck up?  Or no 
[02:35:00]  Do you ever think like  God I want to fucking  Do something bad to him?  Yeah  If you suck my dick  He's going to be pissed  Let's do it  At this point  I would do it  Nice  I'm just so tired  Why are you still sitting here?  Do you want to go find  An empty studio?  Yes  But wait a minute  Let me ask you something  How long were you dating  Before you married?  We've been together for four years  Okay  Oh boy  But there was indication  Before the marriage  There always is  I think  I think it's like  The stress of this next  Chapter of our life 
[02:35:30]  Talking about houses  And babies  It's not even a fucking paragraph  Of a life  Never mind a chapter yet  Screw all that  I saw you two in action  At Sam's wedding  You two are intense together  We like to party  And that's a happy occasion  We fight  We love hard  And we fight hard  Intense  You do understand that  You knew at any moment  Something could happen  Between the two  The partying is going to end the marriage  I hate to break that to you  You should both go to marriage counseling  And cut the shit  You're a nice girl  If you've got a husband  Stop it  We don't only fight when we party  We fight all the time  But the whole mentality  You know what the fights are about though 
[02:36:00]  Screw you Sam  Don't go getting yourself  Fucking knocked up either  What are they about though?  What are they?  There's so many things  And shut the F up Sam  Okay  Don't go getting pregnant  Because then you're saddled with him  For the rest  I'm going right back on birth control  You're saddled with him  For the rest of your life  If you get pregnant  I'm away  And you'll trash that body  Now she goes to the other  What kind of gum is that?  It smells good  Orbit  Would you like a piece?  Okay yeah  I haven't had real gum in a while  I chewed this weird gum  She's fucked up right now  I love Nicole  And then she goes down the hall  And she goes on the morning mashup 
[02:36:30]  As this happy fun person  Why does she get hotter  That I know her fucking life  Is a disaster?  Gee I don't know  Do we really need a psychologist  To figure that out?  Alright  Maybe I shouldn't even ask that question  Sam why are they fighting?  My theory?  Your theory  Yeah  I mean they  I think that they get frustrated  With each other  Sure  When the other ones are drinking  You know  When one drinks more than the other one  The one who drank less  Is frustrated or whatever 
[02:37:00]  If  And they do things  That get each other pissed off  But then they're both  Doing them to each other  Dude  And they're constantly  Either trying to get  The other one back  Or whatever  But it's all the drinking  If this is the same  Type of situation  As me and my ex-wife  It is doomed  We are looking  Dead marriage walking  You just know  It's over and done with  If it's the same situation  And they also  I mean they don't  Like they don't  In my  It doesn't seem to me  That they tackle their problems  You know what I mean?  Like they don't  Figure out what the problem is 
[02:37:30]  And fix it  They just wait  Until it kind of cools over  Five months in  He's fucking throwing chairs already  Right  That ain't good  What happens a year in?  What's he throwing  Them?  I'll tell you what he's throwing  He's throwing Nicole  Across the room  Plus they've already used  The threesome card  We found that out  Yeah yeah yeah  That's like a landline  Or something from  Fucking Millionaire  Right  Like you use it on  The first question  Like what the fuck  Is she doing?  Yeah  Gotta save that  For later in the game  There's still 25 questions  That's to save a marriage  After 10 years  You go like  We might have to

[02:39:00]  That has nothing to do with  She cries  Contacts  She cries  That was a hard cry  She cries  Before she had  Makeup on  Her eyes were all puffy too  And very dark circles  Around them  They get along  Her and her husband  She looks a little  Too thin too  Maybe  A little too thin  Nah it looks good  She's not eating as much  She does look good  But they get along  When they're sober  And I've seen them  And they'll get along  Sometimes when they're  Partying too  Dude at your wedding  But  They drank a lot  And you can tell  At any moment  There could be a situation  It's people that 
[02:39:30]  Yeah yeah  People that drink  And the littlest thing  Annoys them  When you're married  To somebody  That littlest thing  Is even littler  It's like  Anything  Can set them off  And you know  What it is too  There's a lot of  The sort of like  Play insults  Like he'll just  Start playing  And she'll be like  Oh you're so  And then one of them  Says the one thing  It becomes serious  And then it's serious  All of a sudden  And now we're in  This huge fight  Yeah well you're over there  Doing this  And yeah well  I fucked your friend  Oh boy

[02:40:30]  Yeah  What do you  And him too  It's like you guys  You know  You fucking  Want to have a family  Once you hit 30  Yeah  You gotta settle down  Unless you're in radio  I only met him once  But he seemed like  A good dude  He is  He's a fun guy  Yeah he seemed like  A nice enough guy  They're both like  A fun guy  Like a mushroom  I don't know  No not fun  Oh  Fun guy  Holy shit  Was that quick  Like a mushroom  Fun guy  Oh fucking cool 
[02:41:00]  You're crazy  Thank you Chip  I was gonna say  What a fun guy  What's he  With an omelet  Or something  Take us out  Sirius XM  You're listening to  O.B. Anthony  Oh yeah  Whoa  Ozzy  Oh yeah  Little Dolls  Yeah I know this one  Also off  Dire of a Man  Thank you  Give me  Running with the devil 
[02:41:30]  I live my life  Like there's no tomorrow  All I got  I have to steal  Wrong song  What?  You hear it  Whatever happened to Van Halen  Remember they were postponing  I know  And we were the ones  That said  That's going 
[02:42:00]  Bye bye  They never came back  Never  We never saw that coming either  No we didn't see that one coming  Another thing no one saw coming Opie  Oh  The homeless guy  Walking around Times Square  Without his fucking boots on  Oh that's the one  Thank you  Yeah  We said it  We absolutely said  And I was like  Hey you fucking assholes  Why can't you have a heart  And fucking  Because we're realistic  Cute story  I mean this homeless guy  In Times Square  We've seen it many many times  Yeah  What?  He's in Times Square  He's fucking got no shoes on 
[02:42:30]  Has no shoes again  He's freezing  He's walking around  With no shoes  And this 25 year old  NYPD guy  Cop  He goes up to him  Talks to him a little bit  Then walks in a place  Buys some boots for the guy  And gives them to him  He puts them on  And somebody took a picture of it  It went viral  And everybody's like  This is such an amazing story  Of people helping  And you know  And we saw it a mile away  It's like oh wait  Wait till these fucking people  That don't realize  What the real world is like 
[02:43:00]  Get all disappointed  Because as I said  Homeless people  Are not movie homeless people  They're not these wise folks  That decided to be free spirits  And not live in the system  They're not these vagabonds  Who are college educated  Yet fell through some cracks  Joe Pesci?  Joe Pesci?  Things like that  The Harvard one?  The Harvard one?  Right, right  Things like that  With Brendan Fraser I think it was  They're not  They're not lovable  They are mental patients 
[02:43:30]  Run amok on the streets  So he either got rid of the shoes  Because they were evil  Or he got rid of the shoes  Because he could get a few bucks for it  To get some booze  Or another bum took it off his feet  Because his shitty shoes were horrible  But I think he would say  Because he was wearing plastic bags  For her fucking shoes  I think he would say  If they got stolen  What he said was  He has them  But he hid them  Because he could get killed  For wearing them  Liar, liar  No, no, no  You're disgusting  Smelly pants on fire 
[02:44:00]  That's sort of true  Remember when we sent our homeless  Back on the street  With brand new starter jackets  And brand new sneakers  But that was Ziggy  We got a report  That everything was taken  Ziggy was the wounded  Fucking zebra calf  The foal  The little zebra colt  At the watering hole  Silent night  But that guy  Looked like a guy  And put it this way  Every homeless guy  Isn't walking around  Without shoes  Because they get them stolen  Every homeless guy  I've seen 
[02:44:30]  Has shoes  This guy  This guy  Doesn't want to  Fucking wear shoes  I see the guys  With the plastic bags  For shoes  Yeah, well they're crazier  Than the ones that have shoes  We have Ziggy singing  Silent night  Silent night  Ziggy, do you know  Any Christmas songs?  Yeah, I know  It's a Christmas song  I don't know  You want to sing one  Real fast for us?  This guy's dead  By the way  Let's go  Silent night  Holy night  All is calm 
[02:45:00]  All is bright  I didn't have him  Pegged as an alto  Round yon virgin  Mother and child  Holy infant  So tender and mild  Sleep in heavenly peace  All right  Let's hear it for Ziggy  That was NAW or here?  I don't remember now  And you remember? 
[02:45:30]  NAW  That was NAW  Yes  Because you know  We don't do the homeless shopping spree anymore  It was too successful  It was fun  Remember the homeless shopping spree  Remember how successful that was?  Huge  Well, regular radio killed that  I don't want to give up  One of my Dave hearts  I don't want to give up  But you know who agreed with her?  Fucking dumb Chiasano  Let her do it  So it isn't just her fault  It's Chiasano  But that was my fucking turning point with her 
[02:46:00]  I hated her for that  Where I was like  And I didn't like her right from the start  Just because she was a woman  I didn't think she belonged in a man's job  Not a boy, Anthony  But  Furthermore  Yeah  She didn't get the show  She didn't understand what made the show successful in the past  And fuck her mother  God  I also think that was Tom  Wanting that done  And she was the ax man  Get out, Tom  God, look at the videos online  Yeah  We had so many people at the malls  Well, then  They decided to make it go away on satellite radio, too 
[02:46:30]  Yep  The famous Costco story  Which makes me laugh  And then if you laugh at that  They get mad  Yeah  They actually get mad  That we thought  That was a ridiculous idea  It's fucking stupid  We could have them go into the first floor of Woolworths  No, this was Costco  I know, yeah  But the real story is even funnier than what you just did  They want us to take our great event  Homeless shopping spree  Go to a Costco when it wasn't open  Right  And let the homeless people run around a Costco that's not open yet 
[02:47:00]  Without the listeners, by the way  It takes away from the entire gist  Well, it's taken every  Of the event  It's taken every element away from the event  Every element  Them shopping isn't the thing  It's  It's not just them shopping  And then we laughed  And it got back to this person  And it got really mad  And we laughed at his idea  Well, I remember  That was the last time I got invited to a sales meeting  Because I remember sitting in the meeting  And he pitched the idea  And I said, so what?  Then, like, one of us would call the show  And be like, you wouldn't believe the size of paper towel rolls  That this guy's picking up 
[02:47:30]  And he was like, well, I'm just coming up with ideas here  Bad ones  And that was it for me at the meeting  Because then I went on the air and told you guys  Who got married for that?  Let it go for now  He's all fine now  He's all right  That's Blue, he's dead too  Blue's dead too?  Blue died?  Yeah  Oh, I'm shocked  Blue, who else?  Ziggy  Blue, Ziggy  Tippi, obviously  Of course, Tippi  Tippi Tom, yeah  Oh, boy 
[02:48:00]  I thought Obama was going to take care of all these folks  Has anybody here seen my old friend Tippi Tom?  Can you tell me where he's gone?  He grossed out a lot of people  So anyway, the homeless guy  He's shoeless again after all that  Yes, he  Here's my take on it  He sold the fucking shoes  Or traded him to one of his fucking cronies  For some booze or some drugs  But he also knows that they will be taken from him 
[02:48:30]  From other homeless people  So  Maybe, but I don't think so  I think he sold them  There's too much thought behind that  There's too much thought  He wouldn't purposefully be uncomfortable  By not wearing shoes  Have the shoes yet hide them  To keep them from being stolen  He'd wear them until they got stolen  Because the bottom line is  If they get stolen, what happens?  You're walking around without shoes  Right  If you hide them  You're walking around without shoes  Right  He's not hiding them 
[02:49:00]  He's not hiding them  There's no way to hide them  Up his ass  Stupid crazy bum  He's a crazy bum  He's got two fucking kids  I guess in their twenties  A son and a daughter  That, you know, have to deal with the fact  That their father's a bum  Fuck him  The cop tries to do something good  Good  Fool me once, shame on you  Fool me twice  I'll tase you  Beat you with a club  And then shoot you  It's a NYPD credo, by the way  Why don't we talk about WGN News  These people are terrific  That's funny 
[02:49:30]  We had such great stuff today  We didn't even get to the story of the day  Until right now  WGN  Chicago, right?  Yeah, I think so  Chicago  Chicago  They're doing their news report  And a plane crashes  Oh, I saw this  And, well, the news anchors  What they have is a helicopter shot  Right  Of a plane crashed on a major highway  In the middle of the street  Yeah  Pretty dramatic stuff right there  It's unbelievable  It is 
[02:50:00]  All right, let's go back to that picture from Skycam 9  Again, a small plane crash  On King Drive near about 29th Street  It's like a small single-engine plane here  These are our first pictures, folks  So bear with us  We're not getting much information from anyone yet  We're going to try and zoom in  We're trying to figure out if there were any  Yeah, you see it  Lower, on the lower left-hand side of your screen  If Skycam can tilt down 
[02:50:30]  There's a wing  Is that on top of a car there, Larry?  Can you see?  Yeah, there it is  Wow  Oh, it looks like a giant hole in the middle of the street  Oh, my  Yeah, we are not  We haven't seen any analysts here  We see a fire truck  Is it?  Sounds fucking crazy, right?  I love  I love watching local news  This is  Wow, it sounds like an amazing event  And what a scoop, too  Yeah  You know that  You know our dear friend  We haven't talked about her in a while  Pat Battle  She is a very good news anchor 
[02:51:00]  Oh  She truly is one of the best locally in New York  But she's such a monster  That they put her on weekends in the morning  And that just makes me laugh really hard  A monster  Because they know that  They can't put her on the prime time  Yeah  Because she's not pretty enough  Nope  So they get these pretty, pretty ones  That are just  Sorry  So dumb  Hey, it's fucking  To do the prime time  Because it's fucking entertainment 
[02:51:30]  You know  You don't cast Pat Battle to be a leading lady in a rom-com  Unless, of course, it's fucking Queen Latifah  For some reason they've dubbed her as attractive  And suitable for a leading lady  Where the star basketball player goes for her  Shut it  That wasn't believable to you?  No  It wasn't  Alright, so  Plane crash  The news picks up on it  They've got a chopper on the scene 
[02:52:00]  They're trying to get more info  They're all in, man  This is great  This is great for them, right?  Let's hear the rest  I don't know  I hate to tell the cameraman what to do when he's out there  But is there  Are there any ambulances on the scene?  I know we saw a fire truck there  I'm just  Yeah, there's a couple ambulances there  We don't see a lot of frenzied activity around the plane  So  There are injuries  Maybe the injured parties have been taken to the ambulance already?  Maybe  We are just getting word that this is being shot as part of a TV show 
[02:52:30]  They might want to tell  Ah, you fucking idiots  What a scoop  We're not really seeing any activity  Yes, but there are a lot of cameras and a director  Yes  And they're re-crashing again  They're setting up  Oh, there's a little tent for food  The craft service seems to be  It's being shot as part of a TV show 
[02:53:00]  Are you kidding?  They might want to tell the news folks  When they're doing this  Why?  Why?  Do your fucking job, dummy  Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me?  29th and King Drive  It's okay  It's all for a TV show  Even though you see that plane in the road  It's a good news story  Which is what the people are always looking for  Oh boy  You made me rush through the weather  In the end, we brought it to you  Are you kidding me?  The weather guy's mad  I scared myself there  It was a little scary  It's all okay 
[02:53:30]  And the weather guy's mad  You made me rush through the weather  No one watches your weather, dummy  He's mad at those two assholes  He's tired of them  If there's any question as to whether or not the news double checks things before they go on the air with them  Of course not  There's a wing on a car  Oh  No one's over by it  No one's there  There doesn't seem to be any rescue equipment  No firefighting equipment deployed around  No  Bunch of dummies 
[02:54:00]  A lot of  They're really lighting it up too  Even though it's daytime  I don't understand why so much light  You like the weather on the TV  It's useless  What about the traffic on the TV?  Useless  There's not here to be any victims  Oh, here they come walking towards the plane  Getting into position  They're laying them back down around the plane  For some reason  This could be some new type of triage  That they do  It's very serious though  We'll keep you posted  Yes 
[02:54:30]  Oh man  They're setting fires around the victims  It's broken the pavement  Why would they set the fires?  We're on scene here  There seems to be an imperial walker  Standing here  With rebels running about  It's insane  I don't know what's going on  Do you want to move on to other news? 
[02:55:00]  What else is going on?  What do you got to Lindsay Lohan?  Fake news  Oh, enough of this fucking chick  Right  Everyone's saying she needs rehab  She's saying I don't need no rehab  She won't go to jail  She says no  No  No  Right  They tried  There's reports she's drinking  Two bottles of vodka a day  Fucking pussy  She's saying I don't need that rehab shit  Does she drink it and soak a tampon in it  And shove it up there?

If I am or not  It would be nice to be  But from everyone I've heard from  It's a pain in the ass  Why?  It's a hassle  I don't first of all  Don't even know who to get in touch with  And then in order to do something  Where you get verified  Like what do you gotta do?  Jimmy how'd you get verified?  I got verified  By uh  Actually uh  Dane Cook 
[03:00:30]  Knows them  See?  And got them to do it for me  See?  Opie?  How'd you get verified?  Um  I can't say  Did somebody help you?  Oh yeah  Alright see?  You know Jenny Hutton  Is verified?

[03:01:00]  Jenny Hutton  For a favor  That I never returned  Oh man  I was supposed to  She walks on a treadmill  And she gets a checkmark  I was supposed to promote something  That one of her friends did  I said yeah no problem  Then I got that checkmark  And I said see ya  Cause I didn't believe  In what I had to promote  Wait so I brought that  Bullshit Twinkies video  To your attention  Getting it plugged on this show  And she's not gonna get me verified?  You're not verified?  No  How the fuck does that happen?  I got 40,000 followers  Exactly  Should be verified  Hey uh  I can walk on a treadmill  So the point is 
[03:01:30]  Mike Tyson piped in  About the Lindsay Lohan  Oh good  On Piers Morgan  Oh  I guess uh  Tyson's gonna give her  Some advice here  Alright  She's not gonna go to jail  Cause it was third degree  Assault  That's nothing  Third degree assault's  A little slap  That's nothing  But how about lying  To the fucking cops  In California  How about just  Fucking nothing  Ever happens  To this chick in the system  Fuck the police  Jesus  The fuck the police  She's gonna be  She's gonna be  That woman  She's gonna be one of those  Body beggars  Maybe yeah 
[03:02:00]  Or all of a sudden  It's gonna come in  And everyone's gonna act shocked  I'm in my 60s  Have a nice long life ahead  Big plans  You better get on them lady  Who?  That commercial  That insurance commercial  Where the old broads  Walking through the woods  Talking about how she's in her 60s  And has a nice long life ahead  With big plans  What surgery?  Jesus  What did Mike Tyson have for advice for Lindsay?  You see somebody like Lindsay Lohan  She was in trouble again yesterday in New York 
[03:02:30]  You know  Rested for assault and so on  Clearly a very troubled girl  In and out of jail now  I would help her  You went through all that process when you were younger  She's got problems  What I hate about  You're gonna say the same thing I am  This  Ask the question  He's an asshole  He asks the longest questions on TV  He does this all the time  But I'll tell you what he's doing  He knows his question is bullshit  Yeah  You're a journalist  And this is what you're talking to Mike Tyson about?  Yeah  You're trying to get a Lindsay Lohan comment? 
[03:03:00]  Soundbite from Mike  You fucking tabloid idiot  So he's trying to dress up a dog shit question  Yes  It is a dog shit question  He was smarter than what I said  You're on CNN  Because he does this a lot  These long drawn out questions  I would work her freckled titties like speed bags  And that would teach her a lesson  That's what I do  All that process when you were younger  She's got problems with fame  With her parents 
[03:03:30]  With all of it  What advice could you give somebody like that?  His question was 20 seconds long  What advice would you give Lindsay Lohan?  But he had to dial it up  Just so Tyson could find an angle to answer  Because it's such a garbage question  That is simply trying to get a soundbite  A soundbite  Yep  Well you know  I want her to win so bad  I know we wanted her to win so bad  And it all comes down to  Like I was explaining before  It's what you have to want to do 
[03:04:00]  She's not as bad as I was  But she's catching up  She's going to get there soon  The second she rapes somebody  It's just a bad dark place to be  And what does she need to do, Mike?  That's her vagina  She needs a good support system  A bad dark place  She needs somebody  She needs epiphany  She needs this paradigm shift in her life  Epiphany with my cousin  The real life  Everything that she learned in life  Even the good stuff that allows us to succeed in life  Is all a lie  And now we have to start all over  She need a face tattoo  That's true, that's not true  That worked for me  Do you know her?  Have you met her before?  Oh, I've met her, yes 
[03:04:30]  What do you think of her?  She's the chairman Mao on her arm  She's an awesome person  What do you think of her?  We just got to get it together  Nice white ass  Maybe she believes she has it together  You know, and that's nice  I just think she's a good person  And I don't think she's the person  That the media makes out to be  Just no one can be that person  She just can't be that person  You know, probably a spoiled  And, you know, we get upset  When we don't have my way  And things don't turn out the way we want to be  And life, on life terms  Is just kicking us in the butt  And I don't know 
[03:05:00]  And sometimes we can't handle it  And we deserve that as human beings  To have our breakdowns  Unfortunately, for her  Or somebody like me  You are doing it in front of  Hundreds of millions of people  And that's not fair  But it is what it is  It is what it is, Mike  It is what it is  I like the subdued Mike  I like that  He was great  I can't wait for him to come back  I will eat your children  Love that Mike, too, though  Violent, crazy Mike  Subtle, subdued, fucking reflective Mike 
[03:05:30]  I like crazy Mike better  I don't care what happens there  No one does  I think our selfishness is enraging  Until she fucking drops dead  And then just like fucking  Anna Nicole Smith  And Whitney Houston  Everyone will come out of the woodwork  And talk about how troubled she was  But what a great person she was  And how she should have had a support system in place  But in the meantime  The media just loves  You know

Boost  Yeah, he's doing much better than last year  I guess that's because  What?  What could you attribute that to?  I have no idea  The election?  Maybe  I have no idea  I don't know  I can't watch that fucking show at all  Piers?  Yeah  He just looks creepy  He has washed out features

Caillou  Never mind  Caillou  God bless you  I know that fucking  You should know it  That shitty song  And he also looks kind of like a burn victim a little bit  Like some shit was burned off his face  Like his lips  I don't know what it is  It's just like  That little round mouth  He has a long oval face 
[03:07:00]  With a tuft of hair on it  And a tiny mouth  And he's pale  Yeah, very pale  That's an English thing  Yeah  A lot of fog over there  Not much sun  Not much tanning over there in England  Jolly old England  Alright, let's get out of here and start our weekend  Oh, motherfucker  Let's start our weekend  E-Rock  Let's take the E-Rock fucking way down for a while  Oh, boy  Jimmy, what are you promoting, man?
