<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the fallout from the "Hold Your Wee for a Wii" contest, which resulted in a contestant's death and a massive lawsuit against Intercom.  The hosts lamented the end of edgy radio stunts, reminiscing about past outrageous bits like the eggnog challenge (with Pat from Munaki), a bottle rocket launched vaginally, the 55-gallon drum challenge (with cockroaches and eels), the Mentos and Diet Coke challenge, the "Gay Marco" segment, Feels for Meals, the killer beach party, and various bee and mousetrap contests.  Joe Rogan's presence during some of these stunts was noted.  They repeatedly pondered management's reaction ("What would management say?") to their past antics.  The lawsuit's impact on their show and the future of radio, specifically the decline in edgy content, was discussed, along with listener calls and memories.  A “Things Opie and Anthony Can't Do Anymore” segment was proposed, and a surprise celebrity guest in a Halloween costume was teased for later.  Jimmy Norton's appearance on Jay Leno and plans to play audio of it were also mentioned.  The hosts discussed past experiences with Tim Sabian and other memorable segments.

The show then shifted to a critique of inane Twitter updates, particularly food posts, which they deemed arrogant.  They jokingly suggested more outrageous tweets from celebrities like Lindsay Lohan and Roman Polanski.  This transitioned into a discussion of their treatment by Sirius XM compared to other employees' complaints, followed by an anecdote about a past altercation with Jimmy Kimmel and his subsequent apathy.

A significant portion featured a $10,000 Halloween costume guessing game with a surprise guest.  The guest, eventually revealed to be Ted Sheckler, prompted much humorous speculation before his identity was revealed.  The segment included discussions about upcoming football games, particularly Brett Favre's return to Green Bay, fueled by a call from Rich from Wisconsin detailing the Milwaukee reaction.  A call from Susan Finkelstein followed, focusing on her negative experience with the radio station's failure to provide her with Yankees tickets.

A "Jocktober" segment followed, critiquing other radio shows and their "whole" female co-hosts in a comedic, derogatory manner.  This was followed by an old Opie and Anthony prank call from their AAF days showcasing their improvisational skills.

A prank call to a shop selling unusual clothing, involving baby and adult baby voices and explicit references to genitalia while ordering a schoolgirl dress and a baby maid outfit with a slit, was played.  The show then transitioned to a critique of John Sterling's Yankees home run calls, followed by playing audio clips of an interview with Chaz Bono about their transition and family reactions.  Discussions about the upcoming Halloween show, including guest appearances, ensued. Bobo’s arrival in costume was met with frustration due to several costume changes.  A backstage audio clip of an argument between Kenny and Mars, show engineers, was played, followed by a heated on-air discussion between Sandy Kane and Stalker Patty regarding their mutual dislike and contributions to the show.

A segment featuring Sandy Kane, a "Naked Cowgirl,"  followed.  The conversation was highly sexually charged and vulgar, frequently referencing genitalia, sexual acts, and prostitution.  Sandy Kane discussed her body, experiences in the sex industry, and a hotel encounter.  Bobo's penis became the focus of a bizarre game involving the hosts and Sandy Kane, interrupted by management, abruptly ending the segment amidst arguments amongst the on-air personalities.  Sandy Kane also promoted her music, including "I Love Dick" and "The Naked Cowgirl Song," and discussed her stripping past and a prior Jay Leno appearance.

[00:01:30]  And then, uh, you're kind of tired  When you get here  Because it's so early in the morning  So then I go home and nap  And then I nap too long  And then I wake up and start the cycle again  Now I've completely whipped it around to where I think  I may have shut my eyes for 45 minutes  Last night  Last night  And then I woke up  It was about, I guess, 4.30-ish  And I just, I was like  I'm, what am I gonna go back to sleep for a few minutes? 
[00:02:00]  So I just got up  Got dressed and everything and came here  I wound up coming here and getting here like early  Uh, because I just didn't sleep at all  Between the time I woke up from my nap  Which was, by the way  7.30 p.m.  So you slept  Yeah, but it's weird  This is the end of your day now  Yeah, it's the end of my day  So when the show is over  I'm like, shot  Yeah, that's night time for you  Even though it's 10.30 for everybody else  Yeah  Quarter to 11, whatever  I know, I gotta figure out like what it would be  If it was a normal job and normal sleep

Who just said that?  He should be hit over the head  With a lug wrench  You wanna start doing Saturdays?  That's a very good idea  Oh is it?  I think we have one more  Shot at fame  In this business  I think we got one more 
[00:05:30]  One more in us  One more?  Although they're making it  Harder and harder  I guess that's a good segue  To get into the  We for a we thing  Yeah  This fucking radio stunt  Gone horribly wrong  We've been following  For years  When did they do this?  Almost 3 years ago  2007  What was her name?  Jennifer Strange?  Yeah  Yeah poor Jennifer Strange  She came in to win  A dumb wee  For a family  Yeah  And they did the  We for a wee  Which basically  Was drink water 
[00:06:00]  A lot of water  Without going to the bathroom  If you  If you tapped out  Cause you had to go  To the bathroom  Then you're out of the contest  And Jennifer Strange  During the contest  Was saying  That she wasn't feeling good  She had headaches  Blah blah blah  She went home and died  Holy shit  People don't understand  That's every radio guy's  Worst nightmare  They don't understand  Water can be fatal  Right  If you drink too much of it  And don't get rid of it  Well the jury came back  With a decision  Yesterday  This is a big  Jury awards  16 million dollars 
[00:06:30]  In damages  To Jennifer Strange's  Family  And the wee though  Did they get the wee?  I think they threw it away  Sure  Oh okay  Sure I think  Just want  You know  Cause the station  Could probably get in trouble  If they  Reneg on the wee  Yeah  Yeah  I think they  Threw in the wee  Alright  Had a few games  For the family  Two games  We fit  But uh  Yeah  The jury came back  This doesn't kill  The radio company 
[00:07:00]  By the way  Oh no  Doesn't make the radio  Company happy  16 million  I mean  They could have  Came back with  100 million  Yeah  They really could have  Went all out  What company is that?  Intercom  We used to work for  Intercom  Intercom  Good old  Intercom  Oh they're gonna love  Writing that check  No kidding  And radio companies  Can't afford to write  These checks these days  No  But uh  16 million  500  We're just throwing away  The 577 thousand  I guess  Yeah  It's actually  16 and a half million 
[00:07:30]  Basically  16 five  16  Well you round it up  Usually  So 16.6 million  We'll call it  16.6 million  To the family  Yikes  Uh  And  This pretty much  Ends regular radio  By the way  Oh that  Yeah that was a biggie  Even though  When the we for we  Incident went down  It really messed up  Radio shows big time  Everyone got paranoid  To the point that  It affected us  Yeah no more  Stunt type  Shows where you have

[00:26:00]  We can have  Bobo whip his dick out  And make it get hard  And soft  Like a fucking teeter-totter  That's fine  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Let me go to  Eric in Buffalo  Eric  Jesus  What happened?  A penis weightlifting  We're allowed to do  Oh great  How about labia weightlifting?  No  What would  Management  Say  Say  Management doesn't like girls  They hate girls  Eric what do you got? 
[00:26:30]  I was going to say  I wonder if those lawyers  Are going to let you guys  Have any more killer beach parties  Like they have one  You had up here in Buffalo  That would never happen again  And the regular  I'm the regular  The  The  Hardcore listeners  No  That was the bit  That was supposed to get us fired  Yeah yeah  That's what's so funny  About what happened to us  That was getting some legs  That  That event  Was going to get us fired  We were on a runaway train  And we were supposed to be fired  For the beach thing  And then like a mere 10 days later  We did the sex for Sam  I got fired for that  We were out of our fucking minds 
[00:27:00]  So  We pitted down  To one count  Of being assholes  Yeah the FCC  Was looking into it  Even though it wasn't  Ever on the air  Right  CBS lawyers  Were looking into it  The media was all over it  And we were like  We were sweating it out  And also  We moved on to our next bit  Which happened to be  Sex for Sam  It was never broadcast  And then it made  The whole Buffalo situation easy  Because  They said  Ah they're going to get fired anyway  So don't worry about it  That was like  The original Woodstock  If you were there  You know  It's never  You'll never get that feel again 
[00:27:30]  It'll never happen  Like that again  And a lot of people  Swear they were there  Yeah yeah  And they weren't  They just weren't  And fucking  12 hookers  Were eating each other's box  In a circle  On a public beach  With families on blankets  Horrified  Hey man  We had a daisy chain  Of fucking lesbians  Shut up  It was fantastic  What was the vegetable  That one girl used  Oh zucchini 
[00:28:00]  Zucchini  Upper ass  Yes  Dude she stuck a zucchini  Upper ass  On a public beach  Where families  Were frolicking  This  A woman  Okay  That's different  I think we need to bring this  To our radio  It's just a discussion of it  Oh really  All this shit  Is all over the internet  If you're kind of new  To the show  Homoshopping spree  We could do probably  Yeah but now  Now Tippi Tom's dead  Without the Tippi Tom  Or the Zigster  It's really hard to do that  Yeah 
[00:28:30]  Big stars  This is one of my favorite  Newer bits  That we got shut down  Doing  James in Tennessee  What's up James  James  Good evening  Hello  Let me tell you about  Box O' Cox  Oh  God I love that  Fucking bit  How much  That end  Send  Cock emails  To Eric Logan  Well that was always fun  Sending big dick pictures  To Elo  Well cause we got pissed  That he got in our way  I wish  Oh my god 
[00:29:00]  Boy did we fucking  Did we  It was like  We didn't realize  How good we had it  With Elo  And we made everybody  Send him cock pictures  Box O' Cox  Was great  We had a cardboard box  In the middle of the sidewalk  And it said  Free kittens  Or puppies  On the side  And it was just in the middle  Of Manhattan's sidewalk  And people would open the box up  And in there  Were just 
[00:29:30]  Gay  Male  Porno pictures  The worst fucking gay porno  Giant cock pictures  And there was also  At the bottom of the box  A giant dildo  Giant dildo  It was the box of cocks  So people would be upset  Like oh my god  There's a box full of puppies  In the middle of the sidewalk  Here in Manhattan  And they would open the box up  And be horrified  Looking at  Big  Jizzoming cocks  Ah  Reminiscing Opie  You know one of my  Reminiscing  Can you find out 
[00:30:00]  Find reminiscing  Who did that originally  Um  I think that was  Uh  We'll go  Dancing in the dark  Walking through the park  And reminiscing  Da  Da  Da  No not Mary  J  Ply  No let's go to  Chris in the Pocados  Chris  Hey guys  Little River Band  Nice  Was it  1978  Oh  Uh  What Chris  In Philly  You had fans 
[00:30:30]  Yeah we did  Oh my god  I remember that  Even though the guy's  Phone broke up  We had a guy  A Philly fan  When we were at  YSP  Come in  With a  Freeze dried monkey  It was a  Dead monkey  In a bag  Because we wanted  Like the weirdest thing  To bring down  For some tickets  Or some shit  And another guy  Said  I will let  That monkey  Give me a blowjob  If I could have  The tickets  And stuck his dick 
[00:31:00]  In a dead  Freeze dried monkey  Mouth  And pumped his dick  And got a blowjob  From said  Dead monkey  You think we could  Do that now  Well  I  What would  Management  Say  I  I don't think so  The same  That same broadcast  There was a woman  With child  I remember that too  She was such a big  Fan of our show  She came to the broadcast  Outside YSP  There was probably 
[00:31:30]  A thousand people  Outside YSP  And that's not  An exaggeration  Easily  And they were  Watching the broadcast  And she was with child  And she decided  To have a strange  Opie and Anthony  Listener  Watch her child  So she could go off  And blow a complete stranger  And blow another  Complete stranger  Right  As a stranger  Watched her baby  In a little stroller  That was the era  Of Tim Sabian  Who now has to  Make believe he hates us  Which is just  Always terrific  Yeah that's always  Fun and comfortable  I love that  We're the only ones 
[00:32:00]  That are honest  Around here  Tim Sabian  Walks around  He has to hate us now  Because you know  He works for Howard  So he's got to  Make believe he doesn't  Like us  It's so stupid  This whole thing  You stupid  Damn  What about the  Vomiting at  BBCN  The clam chowder  Contest  That turned into  Not only how much  Clam chowder you can eat  Until you vomit  But then somebody  Took the vomit  From somebody else  And ate the vomit  Well  That was so difficult  You're misrepresenting 
[00:32:30]  The bits later  Am I?  Yes  It was our chowder contest  Kind of like the  Eggnog challenge  Yeah  Who can eat the most  Chowder without puking  For Super Bowl tickets  And in typical fashion  We had a pair of tickets  To the Super Bowl  I think it was in  Where the fuck was it  New Orleans  Yeah  Somewhere really far away  We just gave the people  Tickets  They had to figure out  How to get there  By the way  They had to figure out  How to get to the Super Bowl  Two days before the Super Bowl  Very easy  If you call a travel agent  Yeah  And it's a piece of cake  Getting a hotel too 
[00:33:00]  Right  Here's the tickets  Everything else  You're on your own  But they still came out  Of the woodwork  To try to win them  And we gave away  The tickets  And then BCN  God bless them  And they're resting  In peace right now  Motherfuckers  A lot of anger  Yeah  Because I know  What this business could be  That's why I get so mad  By the way  People think I'm just crazy  I am crazy  But I also know  What this business could be  And what it was  And that's why  I'm so fucking frustrated  Every day  Was a new adventure  In what we could do 
[00:33:30]  And just freak out people  Our audience  Ourselves  Oh yeah  What about  Wait wait wait  Before we move on  The second half of that story  So BCN comes up  With another pair of tickets  They're like good news  We got another pair of tickets  We're like well  Fuck we did the  Clam child reading contest  We don't know what to fucking do  Yeah  All of a sudden  Me and Ann look  And there was a bucket  Where all the contestants  Were puking in  Yeah  And all of a sudden  A light bulb  Goes on in our heads  Ah  And they allowed us to do it  Yeah  Management wouldn't allow 
[00:34:00]  This shit now  That's like a biohazard now  And we're like  Okay here's the bit  Who wants in  So most of the contestants  Raised their hand  That lost  We're like okay  This is what you have to do  We got a nice big spoon  You have to  You have to scoop out  Some puke  Out of the barrel  A big heaping helping  On the spoon  We'll decide if it's enough  On the spoon  And all you have to do  This was one of the most  Simplest bits  We ever came up with  All you have to do  Is swallow  The spoonful  Of clam chowder puke 
[00:34:30]  Keep it down  I think for a minute  90 seconds  Something like that  You got the Super Bowl ticket  Everyone's like  That's fucking easy  All these hardcore  Boston dudes and stuff  Yep  One after another  They did it  And started puking  Into the same fucking barrel  Yes  They couldn't hold it down  No they couldn't  And it stunk so bad  Like puke  Double puke  Is really bad  Oh yeah  Puke that's being puked up  Oh yeah  Oh it's horrific  Oh yeah  How about this one  I don't remember this  Underage drunk girl fucking  Ah wow 
[00:35:00]  What  I don't know  What you're talking about  I have no idea  What that is  It's from Hampton's Howie  I don't remember that one  Jimmy actually  Jimmy's gonna be  Jimmy's gonna be in here soon  Yeah  He took a red eye  He was on Leno last night  He killed by the way  He was great  I think we were back on the air  After sitting out  Two and a half years  Yeah  And two weeks into it  We almost got fired again  Oh right  I walked home with Jimmy that day  He actually yelled at me 
[00:35:30]  Yeah  He's like  What the fuck are we doing  Yeah  We can't do that  We just got our jobs back  Right  I'm like  What the fuck are you doing  What are we doing  I'm like  What we're just  We're just fucking  You know  We gotta stop this  He was so upset  Oh was he pissed  And I was just worried  Like  I got that feeling like  Oh my god  We're done  It wasn't our fault  That a girl that we thought  Was of age  Might not have been  And she was completely naked  On the sidewalk  What  Outside our building  On 57th street 
[00:36:00]  As real business people  Were trying to come into the building  To go to work  Oh my god  Statue of limitations  Is up on that  No I don't know  I don't know  I don't even know  We're fine  I don't know what's real  And what's not  I don't either  But a band brought them up  Was what it was  That's right  And they were intoxicated  When they came in the building  That is a fact  I knew that  They were intoxicated  When they came in the building  And uh  You know  She uh  She couldn't walk very well  And we didn't fucking put her out  In the  In the cold 
[00:36:30]  Completely naked  No  Assault on the media  Ping pong balls  Out of the vagina  Whiffle bat challenge  Well  It's another one  That was huge  Well we would probably  Still be doing that one  But  One girl decided  To get a little  Oh yeah  A little uh  Well she said  She was experienced  At putting things  In other girls' vaginas  Yeah  But it was very evident  That she was not  And she hit the girl's  Fucking stomach  She  She pushed a little too hard  And that was a major problem 
[00:37:00]  Yeah  Ending that one  I think we gave  Technically we gave an abortion  In the studio that day  The voyeur bus  That was fun  Until we got 12 people arrested  Yeah I think it's time  To write the book  Now that I think about it  Jim in Canada  Jim  Hey guys  How's it going  Alright Jim  Yes uh  The thing I miss the most  Is uh  Opie being able to  Open up the window  And spray mustard  On random Asian people  Ah  That was another good one  Yes  That poor guy 
[00:37:30]  It was so great  What's that  That was the greatest  Moment of my life  I loved that  Why was that so good for you  Cause I was standing out  On the sidewalk  Oh you were close  Yeah well I was trying  To get the mustard  On that fucking asshole  With the uh  What was he  The toothpick guy  The toothpick guy  That brought in  The Letterman thing  Oh right  I remember  Cause I was sitting there  Getting the toothpick guy  To come out  And I was getting him  Right by the window  We were trying to set up  The toothpick guy  Cause you know  I was just  Extremely angry  That I wasn't able  To smash his work of art 
[00:38:00]  Yeah  That made me mad  That he wasn't allowing me  To do something destructive  Yeah  So then we set him up  Where uh  We wanted him on the sidewalk  Yeah  And Sam was trying to get him  To just kind of hang out  Outside the window  And he did  But next to him  Was an Asian gentleman  Getting ready for work  Since it was 8 o'clock  In the morning  Yeah  On his cell phone  Just talking in his suit  In his business attire  And all of a sudden  Mustard  Rained  From the sky  Rained down on him  Mustard  We saw that guy 
[00:38:30]  In the elevator  Many times after that  He had no idea  He was trying to figure out  Why am I covered in mustard  Cause he looked up  And at that point  You know  We were back inside  God  Remember Club Stinky  Where we would take people  To smoke marijuana  Yeah  Club Stinky  They would go to the stairwell  And just smoke pot  Oh yeah  Uh  Well we're  I guess we're reminiscing  Because the  We for a wee thing  You know  Yeah  Kind of ruined all that  I mean  And they were doing 
[00:39:00]  Safe stuff  Yeah  Oh my god  That stuff was easy to do  Nothing  Now these companies  Aren't going to let you  Get anywhere near the line  So you're going to have  To be clever and witty  And thought provoking  Yeah what could we do  Knife fetish girl  She was terrific  Yeah it was a good one  She loved knives  Being scraped on her  Yeah  Leaving  I mean we had to cut her  A little bit  A little bit  A little bit  A little shallow cuts  She was a big fan  Of the shallow cuts  And it got her  To come to  An orgasm 
[00:39:30]  Stockbroker Dave's  Vasectomy parts  What was wrong with that  We had a woman  Put it on a Ritz cracker  And eat it  For tickets  For Alice Smith  She ate the shit  That they took out  When they gave him  A vasectomy  On a cracker  Yeah we were the show  That brought you cannibalism  You think that would  Go over now  You guys throw darts  At a  A guy's back  Yeah  Yes yes  That was Anthony  Limo Anthony  From Vital Limousine  From what I think 
[00:40:00]  He didn't ever own  A limo company  Or anything  I don't know what  He was about  We threw darts  In his back  Each dart that hit  He was able to  Plug his company  We covered the spine  Though  Because someone  Last minute  Said we could kill him  If we hit his spine  Yeah we might paralyze him  So we just ran  A strip of newspaper  Down his spine  And hit him  In the shoulder blades  And the darts  Stuck  Alright  Fuck  I miss that shit  Blind boxing  Look those clips up  That's not happening again 
[00:40:30]  The teen lesbian  Pajama parties  That ain't happening again  That's not a good one  I bet the company  Would still let you  Staple newspapers  To your legs  Oh yeah  That was  That was something  We didn't even  That was like  Spur of the moment  I remember listening that day  Oh my god  You guys were just bored  And decided you're gonna  Staple newspapers  To your leg  With a staple gun  Yeah we took  We took an entire newspaper  You know  A regular city newspaper  It was more than that Sam  And put it on our leg  This was before jackass  By the way  Yes  We were doing some of those  Jackass bits before jackass  Hoo hoo  You put the newspaper 
[00:41:00]  On your leg  And you take a staple gun  And then go  Right into the newspaper  And then you take a page off  Hand it to the next guy  And he does that  And before you know it  The paper's getting a little thin  And the staple's starting to poke  Through the newspaper  Into your leg  And the Opie won that one  By going  No newspaper  I went sans newspaper  He went no newspaper  And I couldn't match it  Because my leg  Was fucking just  Chopped meat  And bleeding  I got scars from that still 
[00:41:30]  Yeah  That's easy stuff though Sam  That's rookie stuff  We were like  Backyard wrestlers  Yeah  Cutting ourselves and stuff  Yeah  Cool  Are we banned in Newark  I think we are banned in Newark  For our celebrity softball games  That one we should bring back  Yeah we could do that  That we should bring back  If we could still run around  The fucking bases  I don't know if  Oh people get out of hand  Yeah  Shut up  Yeah we did  Jimmy James in New Hampshire  Jimmy James  Gang gang gang 
[00:42:00]  Gang gang gang  By the way  We just got a message  From Club Soda Kenny  Within 30 minutes  You're going to have  A surprise celebrity guest here  But he will be  In a Halloween costume  Oh  The celebrity has offered  A cash prize  For whoever can guess  Who he is  Wow  Very exciting  So this is a contest  For the listeners then  Yeah  Or whoever  I mean if you want  The cash prize  I guess you could  I have no idea  What this is about  Remember the days  We knew what we were  Doing on our own show  Jimmy James 
[00:42:30]  What's going on  That's when we used  To actually plan our own show  Sorry  Hey didn't you  Didn't you boys  Spend a week  Trying to get a pregnant woman  That gives birth  On the air  Oh right  Yeah she wasn't  Fucking cooperative  Yeah we made her  Run up and down the stairs  I think there would be  Some legal issues  With that about now  Yeah you think  We'd be able to do that  She would be  She'd come in  Every afternoon  With her husband  That kid's got to be  10 years old now  If you want to  Really get depressed  No joke 
[00:43:00]  Probably retarded  Because I think  This was around 99  And she would  Get completely naked  And every day  We'd do different stuff  To try to get her  To drop the kid  Live on our show  She was over  Nine months pregnant too  So this was not  This was a real possibility  And we did everything  Jumping jacks involved  Yeah thank you  I was going to say  Jumping jacks  Walking up and down the stairs  And she even had sex  With her husband  Yes  Didn't work  None of that stuff  What about  Wow I wonder what happened  We ought to look  And try to find out  What happened to people 
[00:43:30]  Like Skid Markie  Who is  You know  Some of the youngsters  That were involved  With the show  Who are now probably  Fucking in college  Opie Anthony  Hi I'm Skid Markie  I'm Skid Markie  Remember me  What did Skid Markie do  I forgot his gag  He had goofy songs  Oh he did goofy songs  Was he Stephen Lynch  He was Stephen Lynch  Before Stephen Lynch  He was young Stephen Lynch  Skid Markie  Skid Markie  And then there was  The other kid  The kid that wanted  To go to the hockey game  With you  He's probably 30 now  Let me think  Because he was about  How old was he at the time 
[00:44:00]  Well his age  Was part of his name  I know I forgot how old  But it never went up  It was 12 year old  I think it was 12 year old  Gary  So he's got to be  Gary right  He's got to be 25 now  24  Somewhere around there  I would guess  Jesus  Oh my god  How horrible  So  Going down memory lane  Because of the we for  The we thing  The jury gave the family  Of the woman that died  From that contest  16.6 million dollars  Yeah  And that basically  Shuts down  Shuts down radio  Officially now 
[00:44:30]  Maybe  It shuts it down  Shuts it down  You know what  I think when we're ready  When we've determined  That our  Tenure  In radio  Is up  Opie  We have to go out  Fucking Hiroshima style  Oh yeah  Hiroshima  Oh yeah  Like bring  Or come up with something  Brand new  That out trumps  Every single thing  We just talked about  Oh yeah  If you could also  Keep in mind  There are younger  People associated 
[00:45:00]  With the show  Who would need  Gainful employment  After  Fuck everyone  That's been our motto  Don't make the mistake  That the guys  That came before you  Made  They thought  That we were just  Going to take care of them  For the rest of their careers  What  Make your own career  That's it  Make your own career  My friend  Alienate yourself  From us  When we do something  Like that  Move on  And get a career  We hired guys  That assumed  That we would just  Take care of them  For the rest of their  Fucking lives 
[00:45:30]  And careers  Use it as an  Apologetic  Resume stuffer  Be like  I did work for them  I had nothing  To do with that  But I did have  A lot of experience  In the business  You do it that way  Those guys  Assholes  You know  I'm fine with that  Okay  I'll write you  A non-reference  That you never  Acknowledged  Anything we did  And never  Liked it  And every phone  Is ringing  With more and more  Stuff we used to do  I mean some of the stuff  We probably should bring back  But most offensive  Song contest  That was  That was one and done 
[00:46:00]  That'll never happen again  And let me tell  Let me explain something  That is something  That we should  Absolutely be able to do  On satellite radio  Because of the  Lack of  FCC restrictions  On satellite radio  We should be able to do  The most offensive song  It won't hurt anybody  You know  It'll offend people  Because it's called  The most offensive song contest  But it's not like  Someone could be  Physically hurt  Or injured  And things like that  So we should be able  To do that  And that contest 
[00:46:30]  Never ended  We're still trying to figure out  Who won that contest  They debate that  Yeah a lot of people  The listeners debate that  I think I know  Which one won  The KKK can  The KKK can  KKK can cost  Who could take a bottle  From a tree  When's Halloween? 
[00:47:00]  Tomorrow  Tomorrow  Fuck  Because this one  Because this one  We could still do  Carl in Boston  Boo  Well yeah  Boo is in the  In the title  Of an old bit  Yeah thank you  Carl for reminding me  Boob-O-Lanterns  We could do that one still  That was with  Any girls  That was with implants  Sam this is what  I want you to do  We got a lot of people  That work for SiriusXM  I want you to walk around  Right now  And ask which girls  Have breast implants  And I want the girls  With breast implants  To come in here  So we could put a flashlight  To their breast implants  So the whole thing 
[00:47:30]  Lights up like a  Like a fucking  Jack-o-lantern  Could you do that  Immediately  Yes  Just walk around  And ask which girls  That work for SiriusXM  Oh Jesus  And then tell HR  We said hi  Okay  Oh my god  And tell them  We don't even know  Their names  And we like it that way  I'm horny  For  Cause  Half hairless  Little twats  Okay  Wasn't that a great one?  I remember it  That was one of the  Most defensive songs  That was a good one 
[00:48:00]  And it went on  Like it got really bad  Oh Jesus  Let's say hi to  Kevin in Connecticut  Kevin  What's up guys  Hey buddy  I remember you guys  Had a couple  Fuck on the new rugs  At NEWW  To christen it  In front of  Greg Brady  On regular radio  Yeah  Yeah  We were so angry  With the company  At that  Yeah they finally  Gave us new rugs  In the studio  And we're like  Fuck you and your  Stupid new rugs  Cause the old one  Was all fucked up 
[00:48:30]  Like from all the  Contests we did do  Like the 55 gallon  Drum thing  Like the carpet  Was a mess  Oh yeah  And stunk  So they got us  A new carpet  And poor Pete  The engineer  Was in charge  Of all that  And then we  We just fucking  Had a couple  Have sex in the  In the  In the corner  To christen the new rugs  Pete Johnson  Remember that  It just smelled like  Ass in there too  He's fucking this  He's fucking this chick  Not Pete Johnson  He was  No  Yeah  Pete Johnson  Yeah the couple  Is fucking on the  On the carpet  And Greg Brady  Is just looking over  There like 
[00:49:00]  What the fuck  Am I doing  And then the whole  Studio just  Smelt like ass  And bad sex  The girl I think  Had a dirty ass  Yeah  It wasn't fun  He didn't even  Acknowledge it  It was great  Yeah  We were desensored  At that point  We were  Completely desensitized  How many shows  That will never  Be aired again  I count three  Oh uh  Which three  I don't care  One  Killing the mayor  Up in Boston  Yep  The wolf pack 
[00:49:30]  Young girl show  And homeless Charlie  There's probably  A couple more in there  Yeah  If I really thought  About it  The mayor thing  We can play that  We've replayed that one  I think we went  Step by step  Through what we were  Thinking  And how it went  One April  That was lame  We should have  Never got fired  For that  That bit wasn't  Even believable  I don't know  Why Boston  Believed it  That was a joke  Because I think  The media  They took it  And ran with it  Not knowing  What it was really  All about  Barely played  Any of the audio 
[00:50:00]  So people had  To use their  Imaginations  And went  Oh my god  But if you listen  To the actual show  It was kind of  Hacky to be honest  It was almost  Jacktoberish  Almost  Almost  Yeah  Huh  Yeah that one  I played  Yeah  Alright that one  Will never get played  Oh yeah  We just found another one  Kevin  That was one  That will never get played  Won't even get mentioned  We can't even say it  That's how bad  This one is  I'm pretty sure  Every piece of audio  From that is completely 
[00:50:30]  Deleted from the system  Really  I don't think  It's anywhere  In here  We don't have a copy  Of it anymore  Wow  Yeah but that should  Be allowed  We could say  It featured Francine  Yes  Yeah  It featured Francine  If you have that show  That's a  That's a collector's item  That'll be in the box set  Yeah that's the  Post firing box set  Yeah  God damn  Was that a bad one  That's the Hiroshima  Reenact  When you're ready to go 
[00:51:00]  Who was that bad  That was a close one  Oh shit  That was close  No we could do that  Bit  We could do that  Bit  They're ringing off  The hook  Yeah  That's how we handled  The Wii for the Wii thing  Just showing you  What has changed  Yeah  And now that this  This case is officially over  16 and a half  And a radio company  Had to pay 16.6  You think they're gonna  Let anyone do anything  No the problem is  They won't let you  Even get close to the line  Yeah 
[00:51:30]  That's where the real issue is  You know I  I almost understand  Like they can't take  Chances like  The Wii for Wii  But  They'll take it  This is the problem  With lawyers and radio  They'll take it  Way too far  And go no  We will not allow  Anything close to  Edgy  Or crazy  They don't want to  Defend anything that you do  No  Meanwhile what you're doing  All those things we mentioned  All those bits we mentioned  Were the reason  We wound up being  A very big radio show  It was those bits

[00:55:00]  Here at Jim Norton  With this thing we call  Jim Norton  Uninvited guest  Thank you  How are you  Good  I want to talk this week  About Twitter  Because like most 14 year old girls  I have a Twitter account  And I never understood  How boring  My friends lives were 
[00:55:30]  Until I started reading  Their Twitter updates  Is anybody on Twitter?  On the surface  That's more than it deserves  On the surface  It sounds brilliant  I mean what a great idea  You send out updates  Stay in touch  Hey where's the party  We got a hooker  We're doing an eight ball  But it's never that  It's never fun updates  It's always  I'm tired  Or stuff you don't care about 
[00:56:00]  Like I gotta go to the doctor  I'm suffering blockage  People don't know  What information  Is interesting  To anybody else  One girl I know  Tweeted a picture  Of her feet  And the caption read  New pedicure  I don't want to see  A picture of your feet  Unless they're bent up  Behind your ears  It was a stupid picture  The fact I masturbated to  It's irrelevant 
[00:56:30]  Food updates  Are probably the most enraging  Because they're the height of arrogance  To think that people give a crap  About what you're eating  Like I don't expect you to admit it  But somebody in this room  Is a chronic food updater  Who sends out the little tweets  About what you're having  And I'm telling you for the record  A tractor trailer  Should back over your fingers  My friend Andrew does that  He's constantly updating  Everybody about his meals 
[00:57:00]  Here's a photo of him  But he's a compulsive meal updater  And I got one from him this week  And it said verbatim  Had a salad for lunch today  Dot dot dot  Way too many tomatoes  LOL  But what bothered me most  Was the fact that he wrote  LOL  At the end of it  Laughing out loud  How is that funny to anybody  That would only be funny  If there was C4 on the tomato 
[00:57:30]  And when he bit into it  His head blew off his shoulders  Although the scariest prospect  Is that he was being honest  And wrote LOL  Because he really was laughing out loud  Which would make my friend  A sociopath  Because that means  He was actually writing  Had a salad for lunch today  Way too many tomatoes  Which sounds like something  A hitchhiker hears  Before they're bludgeoning  With a shovel  Because 
[00:58:00]  LOL  Is just one of those things  That we write  When we have an uncomfortable truth  To say to somebody  And we're not too sure  How it's going to go over  We try to soften the beachhead  With laughing out loud  Like your girlfriend  Sends you a text  How do you think  I looked in that dress  Kind of like a fat pig  LOL  Celebrities are known to Twitter  And I think if celebrities  Are going to be on Twitter  They should be forced  To be honest 
[00:58:30]  I really don't need  Inspirational messages  Or life lessons  Or words of wisdom  From these vapid idiots  Here's a few honest tweets  I'd love to read  Lindsay Lohan's on Twitter  I'd love to read this  Forgot my panties again  Tell the paparazzi  To get their  Wide angle lenses ready  LOL  Roman Pulaski  Should be on Twitter  If you hated  The Lindsay Lohan one  You're going to love this one  LOL  Roman Pulaski 
[00:59:00]  Should be on Twitter  I'm horny  Who's up for a game  Of Candyland  LOL  Jessica Simpson  Just kidding  This is a fake  The real me  Is totally illiterate  O-L-L  Steve Phillips  Are you hot and single?  I sure would like  To meet your fat ugly sister  Twitter is available 
[00:59:30]  To everybody  Except for the people  It should be available  To prisoners  Wouldn't you love  To read updates  From guys doing  25 to life?  At least they have  Interesting stuff happening  Got a new cellmate today  Ouch  Or Larry  Cut me on the lunch line  This afternoon  So I broke a gasoline  Balloon over his head  And set him on fire  LOL  Thank you very much  Everybody  Good night 
[01:00:00]  Good night  Hope you and Anthony  On your radio  The workhorses  Of Sirius XM  Satellite Radio  Ow  I want to say  That I think  The company  Treats us right  They treat us right  I heard someone else  Was bitching  That the company  Doesn't treat them right  Oh  That old gag 
[01:00:30]  What's up man  Nice live read  With the ACDC box set  Dang  Oh you like that  Yeah  I liked it  That thing's rocking  I liked it a lot  You know something  At first  I was like  I don't think  I want one of these  You know  I was like  I'm an ACDC  Kind of a fan  But not big enough  To get the box set  Or anything  This thing is cool  As shit  It is cool  I like it  This will look like  This will look cool 
[01:01:00]  Displayed somewhere  Oh yeah  Absolutely  You know  Well you should put it  Somewhere around your bar area  I'll put it by my karaoke  Perfect  Stage  Yes  Perfect  Perfect  It's a quickie  Jimmy Kimmel  God bless this guy  He used to do our radio show  Another guy  That  We used to be pals with  When we  With the ice cream man  Yeah  When you almost punched  One of his good friends  Well what do you want from me  That was the one day  That Scott Herman was  Legitimately scared 
[01:01:30]  That was  The super angry  OP days  Oh fuck  Was I pissed  How close was I  To  To throwing down  Well  Pretty close  We were nose to nose  Pretty god damn close  I did one of those  Fucking I'm a manager  And it was a bad call  And I got right in his face  Like he was an umpire  Put it this way  We've seen that guy  Within the last  You know  Year  Year and a half  Or so  And he still holds  A huge fucking grudge  I actually asked him  We saw him on the street  Yeah  Gary Wall  I go  So what do you think  Of us these days  I had to know  Yeah  And what was his word  Indifferent 
[01:02:00]  Yeah  No but it was  A much better word  Like he has a  He has a  He has a great vocabulary  I think he said like  Indifference  It was  It was a word  That means indifference  Yeah  It was definitely  A little higher up  It was a great  It was  It was a great word  Yeah  Had to give it to him  And then God bless him  For being honest  He goes  Indifference  He held a grudge  I would love to know  What the word was  Yeah well  You know unfortunately  Gary Wall was  Hot daughter  Oh my  Gary Wall 
[01:02:30]  We liked the guy  He was in a bad spot  We were in a bad spot  He was a  Everybody was in a bad spot  He was a real nice guy  He believes in us though  But yeah well  People tend to believe in us  And then something happens  To their beliefs  It's easy to believe in a show  That has an extreme amount of talent  Then they  Yeah  They believe in us  Until their beliefs  Get them on the unemployment line  Then they don't believe as much  But if you have  If you have good skills  That's just a temporary thing  Of course  You'll be working again 
[01:03:00]  Snap back  I told one of the new guys  That the other day  I don't even know his name yet  I go look man  Just take chances  Yeah  You know  A lot of the guys  Who got fired over the years  They're working still  Yeah they're back in the game  The ones that aren't working  They don't deserve to work  Ambivalent  There you go  Oh  Ambivalent  Ambivalence  Yes it was ambivalence  And I still can't say your name  Because I don't know  S-A-I-K-O-T-I-C  How do people remember that  Ambivalent  Was the word 
[01:03:30]  Yes  Yeah  Jimmy Kimmel though  He used to do football picks  For our show  On Fridays and Mondays  And by the way  Big weekend for football  Because you got  Brett Favarar  Brett Favarary  Returning to Green Bay  What did they decide on  By the way  Remember they were running  A contest  Are they gonna like him  Or hate him  Anybody in the Wisconsin area  Can they call  Are they gonna cheer him  Or boo him  But they were coming up  With the best idea  To welcome him back  To Green Bay  How to welcome him back  Yeah  I wanna know what they  Decided on finally  But that's big  Him going back to Green Bay  As a Viking  Wow  And we got a Jets-Dolphins game 
[01:04:00]  Giants-Eagles  And I'm sure your favorite team  Is playing as well  Jimmy Kimmel  Owns Melissa Joan Hart  Did you see this clip yet  It's everywhere  What?  I'm just gonna play  It doesn't need a set up  Clarissa  Listen to Jimmy Kimmel  Oh no  The balls  I'd like to see some of these guys  With balls  I wanna see you do it  I wouldn't be good at it  You come out and do it  But I know my limitations  That's the thing about me  At any point during the competition  Did you consider using witchcraft 
[01:04:30]  To help you?  Whoa  Hold on  That joke is like 1996  I think  So  Yeah but  You know what  So are you  To be honest  Holy shit  I'm sorry  I'm an evil person  Go on  Let's try to get past that Melissa  How great is that?  How fucking great is that though?  What a set of balls  I'm just trying to have a little fun  She goes  Oh that joke is so 1996 
[01:05:00]  1996  Really?  He told her  I'll go home and get your fucking shine box  Yeah  That's pretty much it  Take that has been  Little Clarissa  Yeah she got smashed  What are you doing smashing a comedian?  You don't think he's gonna have something to come back with?  Oh he's gonna fight  Well he did  And what was this about?  I don't even know  Ah whatever  It doesn't matter  It is what it is  So  There you go  On that  Did she pose nude at some point?  Melissa Joan  Wow she looks older huh?  Is that her? 
[01:05:30]  That doesn't  She doesn't even look like Clarissa anymore  She looks like Mary Hart from Entertainment Tonight  That doesn't look like her  No not at all  What did she do?  Okay  Oh she did something like Maxim or something I think  Right  Whatever  Yeah  Whatever  Fuck her in the ass  Oh it's psychotic  Okay sorry psychotic  Let's say hi to Rich in Wisconsin  Rich  Good morning guys  What's up Rich?  I got a little info on you  On what they're gonna do around here  At least in the Milwaukee area  About the Brett Favre thing 
[01:06:00]  Yeah  They're just gonna play every time he's ever fucked up  Whether it's missing a big pass at the end of the game  Or fumbling or whatever else  At least that's what they're doing in the Milwaukee area  And they're gonna air it for like five hours on Saturday  On what?  A TV station?  Yeah  Probably on the local TV stations  See  If the Packers themselves had balls  They would go  We want to welcome back  A legend  That's the funny thing  I've lived in my house  Jesus fucking Christ  Am I even here?  You should handle it like John and Jeff did 
[01:06:30]  What?  Excuse me sir  Opie was speaking for a moment  And you inadvertently spoke over him  If you would just hold on for one minute  And let Opie complete his thought  Then you can speak  Okay sir I'm sorry  You know that's smart  And then we would be syndicated to Lansing, Michigan  Yes  Which would be terrific for us  Sorry Rich  Sorry about that  Jump right on that shit  I apologize  Sometimes there's a lag between the cell phones  Sorry about that  I think there is some kind of issue  Because it happens too much  And I get frustrated by it  But I think you're right  I think there's some kind of cell phone 
[01:07:00]  Oh our guest is here  Hold on Kenny  Hold on  Rich all I was gonna say was  I was taking what you said  And I said if the Packers had balls  They would do some big announcement  We want to welcome back  Like they're taking the high road  Yeah  And then bring your attention to the big screen  Right  And then do a montage of him fucking up  Fucking up  That would be fucking  One for the ages  How is statical would that be  Well he's saying they're doing it on a TV station  That's great  Yeah but fuck that  Do it at the stadium  But put it on the Jumbotron  Yep  Oh that would be amazing  Rich I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot there 
[01:07:30]  I apologize  Oh no problem  That was definitely my fault right there  See I can take blame  Oh it's my fault  It only took 15 years to figure that I can take blame for stuff  Yeah I'm so tired of the whole Green Bay Packers thing  You try and watch the evening news around here  And it's 40 minutes of Packers coverage  And then 20 minutes on who got killed in Milwaukee  Yeah  It's absolutely ridiculous  I hate the Packers  Alright  Go Pack go  I understand that  I understand Halloween's tomorrow  So the local stations are all putting their Halloween costumes on  But Mike Wood  We're supposed to believe he's A-Rod 
[01:08:00]  Is that it?  What is he doing?  Or is that what he likes to take?  Wait a minute  Whoa  What?  What did I say?  Whoa  Check please  Check please  Wow you're a shock jock  I am  They call me  I got my flip out  Because this is going to be terrific  I'm not really sure  But we go to Club Soda Kenny  I'm going to turn this  Speaking of shocking  Yes Kenny  The surprise celebrity guest is here  Uh huh  In his Halloween costume

[01:09:00]  That's the rules of radio  Now I have no idea who it could be  Right  Because no one would have that set of balls on him  Right  Well how about you and Anthony and Danny guess first  Oh why  So we don't have to  No fuck that  If I guess it  I'm going to  I'm taking the $10,000  Now it's been said  Right  Alright  And then we'll give it to a listener  Alright  Should I open the door now  And reveal the celebrity  Wait  We got to organize this better  I don't know what this is 
[01:09:30]  Yeah you can't  You can't make false promises on radio  We'll get sued for that  This is a  This is a Kenny bit by the way  I  I don't know what this is  I don't think Opie does  I have no clue  I have no  This just came out  Now Kenny doesn't  Kenny doesn't do this  He doesn't just come to  On to the show  And start doing his own stuff  Without  Yeah  Us knowing  Kenny  What you're going to do  Go back outside  And talk to the mystery guest  Yeah  And if they're not serious  About the $10,000 
[01:10:00]  They're serious  I was specifically instructed  Dude I'm going to fucking demand  The $10,000  I'm getting a text message  Alright you're getting  The text message  Uh oh  They're coming in now  Oh okay  Hold on a minute  Alright they're knocking at the door  We got  We have a  We have a special surprise  We have to guess  Who the celebrity is  In the Halloween costume  Good morning everybody  Oh my god  Wow  We got a celebrity guest  You most certainly do Gregory  And he's in a Halloween costume 
[01:10:30]  Yes he is  Unrecognizable to all  Oh wow  I'm trying to figure out  Who the mystery guest is  In a Halloween costume  I'm not going to give you  Any hints Anthony  Nor you Daniel  I um  Hmm  Hey look  The hair is there  Um  The hair is there  It's wild  I know your first guess  Is probably  Paul Stanley  If he were a hockey player  But it's not him  Yeah yeah  He's wearing an old school  Hockey basket  Yes I certainly am Gregory 
[01:11:00]  It's very frightening  Yes I know it is  I saw myself  In the reflection  I went  Oh it's me  Hmm  Who do you think it is  I'd rather not say  There's a big cash cries offer  Did Kenneth tell you  He sure did  Yeah he did  And we better not  Plunk a phone line down  No  Hey the phone  We best not even  Touch the mouse for the phone  No that would be smart  Because then we'd have to  Give out  There's a big cash prize  We'd have to give out  The ten thousand dollars  Ten thousand  I said ten  Oh that must have been  A misprint 
[01:11:30]  Oh  It was a ten dollar prize  Oh did Kenny get that mixed up  Yes he did  Oh okay  Hmm  Well um  Why don't you describe  What you're wearing  So we  Because it's radio  I have on a pair of sneakers  Yeah  Oh they're green in nature  And they're tied very nicely  I have on white socks  And I'm wearing a pair of  Gray sweatpants  Which I take when I fly  And his weenie  Is kind of outlined in it  Yes it is protruding  In a lovely fashion  You know my uncle Paul  Used to always notice that 
[01:12:00]  Did he  He used to always say  You know you're kind of  A big boy down there  Wow you do a very good  Uncle Paul impression  Yes thank you Anthony  I've been doing it  For many years  You're wearing gray  Sweat slacks  Why  Why are you half  Fucking erect  What's that  You're half erect  I don't have half an erection  Gregory  I've just always been  A little bigger  Than the other boys  Down there  My uncle Paul  Would always notice  He would always say  That's really a nice one  Teddy  Oh  You know something  Maybe it's 
[01:12:30]  Maybe he's not doing  A good Uncle Paul impression  Yeah I'm a little confused  Maybe Uncle Paul  Is doing a good impression  Ah maybe it's Uncle Paul  Is it Uncle Paul  It's certainly not Gregory  And I'm wearing  Gray underpants  And I have on  A black sweatshirt  And I have on  A black shirt  And I'm wearing  A fanny pack  Which I am filled  With marmalade  Marmalade  A fanny pack  Full of marmalade  Which is what I fly with  Tastes like I'm frightened 
[01:13:00]  Where'd you get  The wig from sir  Who who  Or is that your real hair  I don't want to say  Gregory  Keep it away  It's a wig  It's long  Crowley black hair  I had a wig  Emporium  But it went under  So I saved  A few of them  I don't know  You want to guess  Ant  I think I should guess  Alright  Is it  Ted Sheckler  Can't have told you  I knew  I knew  He couldn't  Keep a secret  Ted Sheckler

[01:14:00]  So I played hockey  Instead of grieving  Yeah he's either  Like a Friday the 13th  Kind of a bad guy  Yeah that's what I'm supposed to be  I'm supposed to be Jason  With a Jew throw  There it is  Ted Sheckler  Yes  Ted Sheckler  I don't think  Ted has sold this one  Very right  No  No it was very  I didn't know at first  I thought it was Jimmy Norton  No it's not  Because Jimmy wasn't

[01:22:30]  With some lasers  And shit  With some lasers  Opie and Anthony  The workhorses  Of satellite radio  Yeah  Co-fucking-Cain  That killed 30 seconds  But I'm still trying to eat  I'm still eating  Oh my god  I have one more little bite 
[01:23:00]  Wait I might be good  Play something else  I got one bite left  Hold on  Opie and Anthony  The workhorses  Of satellite radio  Alright I'm good  Alright hold on  What?  It's easy to grin  When your ship comes in  And you've got the stock market beat  But the man worthwhile  Is the man who can smile  When his shorts are too tight in the seat  Okay pookie 
[01:23:30]  Okay pookie  Um  Was there anything better  Than the index sweep  Index finger sweep  I should say  What do you mean?  Jimmy would probably appreciate this  More than you Ant  Because  You don't like any  Kind of disgusting things  No no  When you're  You're eating  Like I had a bunch of pop tarts  And I noticed  There was some goodness  Still in my mouth  Ew no  You use your tongue  And you take your index finger  And you do the index sweep  From the front  Oh no  All the way back to your molars 
[01:24:00]  And it scoops it down below  And then  Holy shit  Then you can swallow the gimme  You give up your tongue  And you bring it back in  Yes I do scoop sweep  With the index finger  Or with the tongue  Depends on  If it's gunked on my teeth  Like a bready product  Then I must use my finger  Thank you  Because the tongue  You really can't get the jab done  Tongue  And then you put a little water  If you need to  And go  Alright  No  Once something goes in your mouth  It's amazing  It can't come back out  On your fingers  Or anything  It's got to stay in there  Like  Like you're swallowing spit 
[01:24:30]  All fucking day long  Yes you are  But  It's your spit  But you're not spitting it in a cup  And then drinking it back  That's disgusting  Yet  You're doing it all day  All day long  See you can swallow your own spit  But man  Thinking of swallowing  Someone else's spit  Will fucking make you puke  Unless it's  Let's see  Who's my newest  Bestest girlfriend  Joy Behar I think  Oh Joy Behar spit  That would be horrible  No my newest  Bestest girlfriend  That blonde chick 
[01:25:00]  From fucking  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  But she's grown up now  A little bit  Alright  What is she 15  No she's 17  Alright  She's almost there  Almost there  Dakota Fanning  Was all over the  Entertainment shows  Last night  What did she do  She's fucking growing up now  Let's see her  Maybe  I think she's in one of those  Werewolf  Twilight  Fucking  Harry Potter type movies  Werewolf  Twilight  Harry Potter  I don't know  They're all  They're all very confusing to me 
[01:25:30]  Yeah  Jimmy just got back in from LA  And  Yeah  Jimmy we talked about  The Wii for a Wii  Family got 16.6 million dollars  Fucking ridiculous  Lady dies doing the Wii for Wii contest  And the jury awarded  The family 16.6 million dollars  Which shuts down radio officially now  Yeah  Officially shuts it down  No more fun  Not like we were having fun  You know  That sucked  Before you can't bring anything in  But we were talking about that earlier  All the fun we used to have 
[01:26:00]  Dragging broads in here  Fucking them  Leaving them on fucking sidewalks  It was awful  Oh wait a minute  What  Did we say that  No we did not say that  Anyway  Statue of limitations  I also asked the Wisconsin people  To give me the list of things  They're doing for Brett Favre's  Return to Green Bay  Brett Favre over  Well the mayor  Because he's got such a great sense of humor  In the Green Bay area  His name is Jim Schmidt  I believe  He's encouraging  Are you ready for this Jimmy  He's encouraging  Everybody to wear flip flops 
[01:26:30]  To work today  Oh why  It's called flip flops  Flip flop Friday  Flip flop Friday yeah  See because Brett Favre  Did a little  Of that  Of that  Yeah flip flopping  I heard that  They were doing this other thing  With people giving the mayor  Flack for  What is that  Where he said  He was going to encourage people  To burn  Brett Favre effigies  And hang  Brett Favre dolls  By the neck  Why don't they go all in  Why not 
[01:27:00]  Yeah  Let's go old school  Get some stuff done  So it's flip flop Friday  In Wisconsin  And then this  Hang on to your hats  On this one  Uh oh  Tomorrow from 3 to 5  One of the breweries  In the area  Hosting a big Packers rally  And yes Anthony  Because I know you were wondering  They're going to serve  Waffle fries  Because you see  Brett Favre  Did some of that  Flip flopping  Oh that's funny  And they're going to solicit  Packers theme name suggestions 
[01:27:30]  For it's new beer  And root beer  Which will be served  As part of the celebration  That is funny man  Isn't that great  God  Why don't they just paint  Why don't they just serve duty  Because they think  He's a piece of shit  Duty  Duty pancakes  I like when you just say duty  I only say duty  That would be great  If Jim Schmidt the mayor  Just lost his mind  And that's what he really wants  Everyone to do  Is eat a shit pancake  Good luck  Good luck to you  Good luck  He's going to 
[01:28:00]  I guess  It all depends on how he does  I guess  If he's kicking their ass  They're probably not going to  They're not going to be cheering him  For very long  No no no  I bet they give him  A little bit of ovation  When he comes out  I think they'll be kind of nice  I think they'll be nice  You know  No I think  I think there's going to be  A lot of confusion  Yeah  You can hear some cheers  And boos  Yeah boo  But it's going to be in such a way  You're not sure which one is going to win 
[01:28:30]  And then I think the boos win in the end  Yeah  Because you're all riled up  And you're fucking  You're high  And you got a lot of beer in you  Gotcha  So  You want to do some Jacktober  The last one  No  Okay I'm with you today  I don't want to do Jacktober  I'm so with you today  You know something  What I learned from this year's Jacktober  It's very mean  To just pick out shows  And who are we to decide  If something's good or not  So I think we should end it 
[01:29:00]  Today  Well  We can at least do this  The tribute to the whole  Because Troy Kwan  Who is Club Soda Kenny's personal producer  Even though he doesn't really produce anything  For Kenny anymore  Troy Kwan and Derek came up with the  Tribute to the whole  Tribute to the whole  Because this is pretty much it for Jacktober  Now I don't  I don't know of anybody who doesn't know what a whole is  What the whole is on the radio show  But it's that female 
[01:29:30]  That female presence  Yeah that all program directors think are necessary  When there's a guy show  Because they're there to calm the guys down  The guys get a little too rambunctious  So they start talking about things  And they got to be reeled in  Or God knows where they'll end up  Correct the window  Maybe in the entertaining zone  You don't want them going there  So they got some broad in there  To uh  You know  Shut him up  Right on the brink of humor  Speaking of broads  Yeah 
[01:30:00]  Speaking of broads  The morning mashup  We all just spun our heads around  The morning mashup  Once again  The star of the morning mashup  All walking together  The star  Hi  Hi  How you doing  Hi  Hello  Hi  Hi  Just  Hi  Taking a break  From the art show  To look at  Say hi to you  Okay  Done  Here's the tribute to the whole  To celebrate the end of jocktober  The Opie and Anthony show proudly presents  A tribute to the whole  The most unnecessary member of any radio morning show 
[01:30:30]  That is tasteless  Oh stop it  No that's not fun  Oh that's disgusting  It's like  He's so hippy dippy California  Ukulele  Redlocked  Not me  There's this dude  Named Paul Unca 
[01:31:00]  My dog was the most stable man in my life for 12 years  It's like somebody gives me truth serum in the morning and I can't hold back  Random  Oh that is so tacky  Wow  Wow  That is  That's pretty good  Perfect  I didn't like that promo though  It made women in the radio sound stupid and trite  Did it

[01:32:30]  That the whole fucking  You know  Country would have picked up on  And they just fucking  Hit in their offices  Where did you  Where did you sit  Not only that they said  Sorry sorry  Sorry Ann  Not only that  A memo sort of went out  Not an official email  That  That she would not be getting tickets  From this fine company  Because you're not promoting competition  Is that why  Well you're kind of  I mean  I mean you want to go to every game now  That's kind of  It's a little greedy  It's kind of  Well there's a definition for that too  You know 
[01:33:00]  A little prize pig  Poor  Poor  Listen  They put me up like  Four feet from the  Like root  Oh I thought you sat on the foul pole  So you went to Yankee Stadium yesterday  Jesus  And listen  Let me tell you  Like I was  Like what the joke  Well kind of the joke  You said about me  If I had gone to the bleachers  I wouldn't have been  A false accused  I would have been like  Sexually exhausted  Yeah you look like  A glazed donut  Or strudel  Or something like that  If you went to the bleachers 
[01:33:30]  I mean like  People saw me  And I was screaming  Finkelstein  Oh  Did they recognize you and shit  Yeah and they were like  Trying to grab my like  Breast  And they wanted like  Pictures and autographs  Oh yeah  Is this the girl  Yeah it's the girl  Oh this is yeah  Whoa Jimmy  You don't even know what happened  Wow  I know what happened  Danny fucking worked his balls off  And got her to call our show  And we had her  And we're like  Yeah fuck all I have to  Is give her tickets  And this story will be  All over the country  And the fucking middle management  This and that guys  Fucking blew it 
[01:34:00]  Yeah  The quote was  We are not giving  World Series tickets  To a prostitute  But she's not  She's like  But it was very clear  After our interview  With her  That there was some  Questionable things  Going on with the officers  Yeah  You know  Maybe something that  Could be considered  Entrapment  What kind of cop would do that  Anyway  Search the internet  And go after a girl  What the fuck  I'm a cop you idiot  Asshole  Now you're getting tickets  From everybody right  Well actually  We were  We just did the early show  And Tyree Smith  Is a game up kind of guy  And I think 
[01:34:30]  This was about  In New York  And a week before  We headed back to Philly  I would call you  And then  But thank you  For the ticket  Well first of all  We put you on the map  You spoke  Much less than you  Were we the first interview  You did  Yeah  I guess my lawyer's advice  Let me tell you  Yeah I bet  Yeah we were the  Because I like you guys  So much  I gotta do these guys  I have to do this show  Yeah yeah  The show  And now because of  This whole controversy  You're going to  At least two games now  Yeah 
[01:35:00]  Yeah man  Let me bring some  Tissue with me  So I can get a no sleep  I have to tell you  I'm not really that impressed  With the new Yankee theater though  No  What?  Why?  It's huge  I mean  You feel like  It's fun  Intimate  It's cause there's a lot  Of Yankee fans  Holy shit  It's like 10% empty seats  But for all the hype  How come every seat  Wasn't filled then  What?  Is that true?  Probably because corporate people  Own them  Give them away  Whatever these assholes  My god  Asshole company  Is that really true? 
[01:35:30]  I want to find out  From somebody else  That was at the game  She'd be a size queen  A lot of empty seats  When I go to the game  In Philly  Like people  They're standing room  Only seats  I mean people are like  Trying to like  Sit on each other's lap  There's not an empty seat  In the house  Well that's you  For another ticket  And you know  It's just like  Holy shit  This place is enormous  What is it  Like 70,000?  Perhaps right  Somewhere around there  I was in a lot of press  With the graphics  The board  Whatever  The whole thing  Is all very corporate to me 
[01:36:00]  So is the media attention  Coming down now  Susan?  I want to have  I think I got  A Facebook message  That I'm the favorite Jew  Of all Turks  Oh there you go  And someone wrote me  Something in Hebrew  And I don't read Hebrew  Oh  I can only imagine  What that is  So you're a married woman though  Married woman are you  Miss Finkelstein?  You're married?  Yes  I'm Mrs. Finkelstein  Alright  But we kind of got  An inkling  From talking to her yesterday  That there might be 
[01:36:30]  Now I'm just saying  Might be  An inkling  Some swinging going on  With her and the hubby  The inkling  Wasn't that a group  That a bunch of writers  Hold on here  Same  She won't deny it  I actually can't comment on that  But I do have a good  Good response to that  That I came out with  Yeah  Is it  We'll try it out with you  Alright  Let her rip  The only swinging  That turns me on  Is Chase Utley's bat  I see  I hope you're in a car accident  On your way back to Philly 
[01:37:00]  No but they're gonna have to  Resuscitate me  And I'm not pregnant  So  Chase Utley's bat  I getcha  Wow  Anyway  I just wanted to  Follow you guys  I knew Jimmy would be pissed  I love this guy  Because everyone looks at me  Like I'm a lunatic  It's like  Will you fucking wake up  And help us out here  This was a no brainer  Yes it was  Yeah  And at the very least  You could go  Ah that's Opie and Anthony  They did crazy things 
[01:37:30]  You know  They did it as a goof  We're saying the company  You can explain yourself  The company should have  Given us tickets  They should have ran down  The hall with the tickets  It was a great opportunity  That once again was missed  But God forbid  There's controversy  With our show  And satellite radio  And they actually  Let us give you tickets  And get in the newspaper  And you know  Get a little press  For everybody  Instead  Are they like  Are they conservative  Do we own  Like on by Mormons  Or something  Or what  You'd think so  It's satellite radio  Where you know  It's uncensored  And things get a little crazy  The day

[01:38:30]  Question for everybody  He made it as a fun  Little Q of the D  Question of the day  How many cops  Have been shot  In Philly  In the last month  And then when they  Gave the answer  There was a lot of  Applause  And laughing  So he should go  Fuck himself  But he beat us  He beat us  The punch  But there were  Radio stations  Lining up  But we had the  First chance at it  We blew it  Other than that  Lining up  Not everything  Sounds good  Double entendre  I don't know  You get good seats  For the Philly game

That would be 95 through 98 Sam  Just say 96  96, 97-ish  Yeah  Now let's  When we were doing Jocktober  Two of the things that we noticed  That you guys didn't like  Corny prank phone calls  Yes  They didn't like that  Oh no  And talking over beds  Yeah they hate that  Now have you ever heard 
[01:48:00]  A corny prank phone call  Oh and voices  Like over the top character voices  Have you ever heard  All three of those  In one?  Alright look  No  And I don't want to  Come on  I'd like to hear it  This sucks  Anthony does do a lot of different voices  Shut up  No I don't do this  But Opie does too  People don't realize  Opie's got his own skill set  I see the bit we're about to play  And I swear to you  I have no recollection of ever 
[01:48:30]  I don't either  That's why I'm petrified  The stuff I liked  The stuff I liked from our AF days  I saved  They're on little dats  This bit did not make the dat thing  Yeah  Well  Jesus Christ  He looks the same  No  Let's get some of that memory back  He looks anything like Goose  Sure he does  He looks like Goose after his head hit the canopy  And his hair came off  He looks like a real Goose  Silly Goose  Who was he on ER  Cause he looks exactly the same  When he was on ER  He's a bald prick  Dr. Green  He lost his hair in like a week 
[01:49:00]  Yeah  What happened  That's what happens  Alright  So  E-Rock helped me find this  So  And E-Rock's  Oh did he  This is his fucking revenge  For the virus  E-Rock has not enjoyed Jocktober  As Jocktober gave birth  To the virus  Yeah  Do you want E-Rock's angle on this ant?  What?  He doesn't have any angles  He's around everywhere  No?  Do I  I thought I deserved a little more  Do I set up?  It's  You want me to  Yeah yeah  Go ahead Sam 
[01:49:30]  Well I listened to it  And what it is  Is you guys  I think  No  I don't think so  You guys found  Like a porno catalog  Oh no  That uh  Actually  Sells  Things for adult babies  Who are into that sort of fetish  No  And what you guys did  Is you called them up  As one of the  Crazy weirdo  Type of  Couples  Was this on the air?  Yes it was  I don't remember this  I don't remember this  I don't remember this  And the way you two 
[01:50:00]  Shut up Jimmy  It sounds good  No  There was no woman on the show  But the way you two got along  You'd think  What are these two guys?  Married?  Oh my god  Damn it  Oh this is terrible  I'm looking forward to this  I don't remember this  I am douche chilling  So fucking bad  It might not be bad  At the thought of it  This could be the longest  Three minutes and fourteen seconds  No it's gonna be really bad  Cause I know what I was like back then  I know what I was like  You sounded like  Cause I know you now  And the voice  You did sound like  You were pretty happy to be there 
[01:50:30]  I mean  That was me  Happy to be there guy  Yeah  I remembered working construction  A little too vividly  So when I was sitting doing radio  Very very happy to be there  You sounded happy  Alright  Oh fuck  Let's take a listen to this  I'm not looking at anybody  Mail order  I'm looking to place an order  Okay what are you ordering?  I was thinking of  Starting with the school girl outfits  Okay what catalog do you have?  The adult baby catalog 
[01:51:00]  What page number?  36 looks pretty good  The sweet girl dress  Well what can you tell me about this dress?  It looks like it's black and white  Looks like a little girl dress  Has kind of like a bib on it  Well that's good  Cause he's always drooling  And spitting up  Okay I did my wacky guy voice  Oh god  So what are we supposed to be?  Like  Like lovers  And  What are we supposed to be?  What's the gist of this? 
[01:51:30]  I believe you're supposed to be lovers  However  I do not think  That you guys had a solid game plan  Going into this one  Because  You both kind of  Lost your character focus  Focus  Really?  Yeah  I mean there were  Several different voices  Done by both of you  I think the listeners  This is like sitting in with a PD  Yeah  He's critiquing our fucking bits  I think the listeners know by now  That we just like to wing it  Yes  We continue to wing it to this day  So far it's not bad  Cause you haven't 
[01:52:00]  All you're doing is prank calling a place  That sells weird shit  The set up is fine so far  Yeah  Well that's good cause he's always drooling  And spitting up on himself  It's below the knee with a full skirt  For lots of petticoats  Is there enough room in there for the  You know  Yeah you know what  Come on be straight with her already  The male organ  For a baby day  He's hung like a horse  The male organ  It's a dress  Well I never put on a dress before  I once put on my grandmother's panties though  The big bloomers  And boy do they smell  Of course it's gonna be 
[01:52:30]  I mean you're gonna have more room  For your penis in a dress  Than you are in pants  You know  Yeah I just never thought of it that way  What about the rubber  Jesus Christ  Ah she fucking shut us up  No kidding  So far it's fine  It's  It's alright  You know  Yeah I just never thought of it that way  What about the rubber panties  Rubber panties  What about them  Yeah he wants to put them on his head  While I give bad boy a beating  With a spatula  Whatever floats your boat hon 
[01:53:00]  Harry shut up  Or I'll shove that pacifier  Where the sun don't shine  We'll ask her about the vagina panties  Why'd you switch cameras  Who are you there  Oh god no  I guess this is where it starts getting bad  What's that from Harry  Nagging the guy named Harry  What is that  I don't know  What about this guy  Locked over  I don't remember this whatsoever  It seems like you guys both started realizing 
[01:53:30]  How fun each other's voices were  Yeah  So you just start jumping into each other's impressions  You know he's having a good time  I'll do that  What  It's over  Whatever floats your boat hon  Harry shut up  Or I'll shove that pacifier  Where the sun don't shine  Well ask her about the vagina panties  Uh yeah ma'am  Do you sell a lot of those vagina panties  All the time  And they can wear them backwards  And it kind of  Any way you want to wear them  Wear them on your head  Uh Harry  Baby hungry 
[01:54:00]  Oh  What's wrong  Baby hungry  Yeah  Oh Jesus  It's cool  I'm not wrong doing a bunch of voices  Why am I changing my voice  When I talk to Harry  Yeah what is going on with that  Because when baby gets hungry  Baby voice change  Do you think we high-fived after this call  You should have with guns  See where you want to wear them  Wear them on your head  Uh Harry baby hungry 
[01:54:30]  Oh Jesus  I'm hungry  That sounds like you talking to Kenny every day  Oh he's almost tapping  Oh my god  Why am I hungry  You're a baby  What is Anthony going to do  Oh  Shorts  Oh jeez  But now no more strained beats  No strained beats  Last time you messed your diaper up  It looked like a Picasso painting  For god's sake  Now hold your horses 
[01:55:00]  We'll play choo choo later  Now I'm trying to order a dress from this woman  I've never ordered a dress before  How do I go about doing this  How is it  Why is he ordering  I was ordering  Because you were ordering  What happened  You was busy  Anthony was busy doing really good art references  Yeah  Yeah  Wow  Picasso  Yeah  And you slowly turned in from somebody  Who's just a normal guy  Wanting to buy a school girl dress  Into an adult baby  And adult babies can't order things on the phone  There's babies 
[01:55:30]  And plus  Multiple person  Yeah baby hungry  Multiple personalities  I like it so far  We really did lose focus  Yeah  There's two people on the phone  Like this is  Operator's probably like  Obviously this is a radio station  There's two people on the phone  Yeah what the fuck  How could there be two people on the phone  I'm very confused by this  Prank call  I've never ordered a dress before  How do I go about doing this  You have to figure out  What size you wear in women's clothes  About like a waist measurement  Waist measurement  That's gotta be well up into like 
[01:56:00]  The 50s and 60s  Okay  I need something with a slit up the side  Because I like when the wind comes howling through  I like a baby maid outfit  Well you look through the catalog  You find out what you want  I know what I want  I want the baby maid  She's unflappable  I want to be a baby maid  A big fat baby maid  I got that slit up the side  So the wind comes howling through  We get it  You know what  Oh Harry Harry  Yeah yeah yeah  Hold on you were inspired  No I'm not inspired  Gee  What did I want  I think I wanted the baby maid outfit 
[01:56:30]  With the slit up the side  So the wind come howling through  Harry's voice does kinda change too  When you start  It gets like  Put a hole in my head  So the wind can howl through that  Jesus Christ  I stink  Nah isn't it  If I ever see the old version of Opie  I'm gonna fuck him up  Yeah  Really  I will fuck him up  What if he's in a diaper  Oh Harry Harry  Yeah yeah yeah  Order the riding horse  With matching baby bib too  Oh can we get that  I want that 
[01:57:00]  Do you see it in the catalog  Yeah  What page  I need you to tell me what page  I was on the page  With a padded fanny  So I could get that supple butt look  Oh page 12  Page 12  Okay  Does that big bottle come with it  A big baby bottle  No  It doesn't  Can I get that  Cause just looking at that  All of a sudden  I'm  Oof  And the big  Diaper pin  Okay  Uh oh Harry  What  What  Baby made poo poo in his pants  Okay look  What the fuck 
[01:57:30]  What the fuck  Are we thinking  Opie you look embarrassed  Yeah  Opie's just turned his head away  Did baby make poo poo in his pants  Baby made poo poo  Baby made this bit in his pants  This sucks  Holy fuck  Hey fucking assholes from the past  You don't have to put everything on the air that you try  Fucking assholes  Yeah just because we fucking  What happened was we played a lot of music 
[01:58:00]  So instead of like  You know  Taking it easy  We figured we'd try to make prank calls  While the music was playing  And there were duds  We didn't have to play everyone  We did  No no we didn't  And the big  Diaper pin  Okay  Uh oh Harry  What  Watch  Baby made poo poo in his pants  Oh my god  Are you gonna use your credit card  Credit card  I don't have time for that  I gotta change a little poopsie bear  Oh there there there  I'll get some baby wipes  So you don't chafe  That corset knickers 
[01:58:30]  The corset knickers  On page 13  Uh huh  You see how that girl  Cinching that up  Yeah  Can I get someone to put the knee  In my ass like that  And pull back  Yes  Hey hey hey  No don't call me  I'm serious  Hello  There we are laughing  Patting ourselves on the back  For a job  Well done  You guys got her  We finally got her  Didn't we  That was not  October worthy though  I don't think it was  That was not that bad  Shut up  I'm serious  It wasn't great 
[01:59:00]  But it was  Nah it was alright  Cause you were calling  A weird place  It was every bit as hacky  If not worse  Than anything we have played  During jocktober  I don't think so  No way  From any other jocks  No  The only saving grace  Is that was fucking  Mega years ago  And what we played  For jocktober  From the other shows  They did like  Yesterday  That day  Right  Oh my god  Whatever  Did baby make poopies  I made poopies  Fucking  But we were so much better  Right  Yeah  I love that argument 
[01:59:30]  Back then it was so much better  Really  Really we were  Huh  Dude  Feeling a little chill  You're on the mark  Toshara  Is that what he said  Yeah  What was the  We don't have that call  Do we  Mark sends a text message  We should have  All of the  Home run calls  That he does  Oh the John Sterling  Calls from last night  Yeah  We got them from last night  Oh yeah  Okay good  So John Sterling  Yeah we can do this  Before break 
[02:00:00]  John Sterling calling  Thank you Sam  The Yankees  Big win last night  Series tied at one  Everyone knows that by now  But this is  Two of his home run calls  From last night  And here's the 1-0  Swung on  There it goes  To deep right center  That ball is high  It is far  It is gone  Oh what a home run  Mark sends a text message  To the bleachers  In right center  You're on the mark  To Sarah  His long home run 
[02:00:30]  Plies the game at one  It's the fucking  World Series  Asshole  Do that shit  In preseason  I was telling Anthony  Because I  He's horrible  Net as high  Net as far  Maybe made poopies  I was telling Anthony  I was coming home  From the hockey game  The other night  I'm not a big Yankee fan  Whatsoever  So I don't really listen  To the games on the radio  But it's the World Series  So I tuned him in  And I'm like  Wow you know  The guy actually calls  A very good baseball game  I agree  And if he just would  Knock this shit out 
[02:01:00]  He would be one of the  He could be one of the greats  The problem was  He's great  When the Yankees lose  Because they're not  Hitting home runs  And they're not doing  Anything worthy of him  Throwing out those  Stupid fucking names  And everything  Text message  So  To Sarah's got two things  A text message  Why would he  It's not a text message  It's a baseball  You're on the mark  To Sarah  Are you  Yeah  Fucking  The World Series  That is fucking  Embarrassing 
[02:01:30]  And terrible  Yeah  It's fucking  Unlistenable  I actually listen  To ESPN radio now  It's un  Listenably bad  Yeah  It's unfortunate  You know  I mean that  That home run call  Is as forced as  The prank call  We just  Dude it's so forced  So forced  It's not natural  Whatsoever  No  Here's the other one  Here's Pedro's pitch  Swung on and  Hit on the air  To deep right  It is high  It is far  It is good  A decky 
[02:02:00]  Matsui  It's a one-two  Pitch in the right  Field seats  A thriller  By Godzilla  By Godzilla  And the Sayonara kid  Homers to right  And breaks the one-one tie  In the sixth  He just broke a tie  In the World Series  And that fucking idiot  Has to make it about  His shitty catchphrases  Right  I'll tell you where it's good  I don't mind this part  I don't either  Swung on and  In on the air  I like this  It is high  It is far 
[02:02:30]  It is good  That's it  No no  One more  A decky Matsui  Hits a one-two pitch  In the right field seat  Time  Right there  That's excitement  That's a good home run call  Right there  Don't force your own  But he's not gonna stop  He thinks it's cute  Or it's funny  And it fucking stinks  Dude  It stinks  And it has nothing to do with  How he calls a baseball game  It's completely different  It's a fucking World Series  Shut your mouth  It's not about you  It's about the players 
[02:03:00]  It's not about your catchphrases  And then of course  They win  And you get this  Now Rivera is set  It'll be a two-two to stairs  The pitch is  Struck in a swinging  Ball game over  Yankees win  The  Yankees win  It's not endearing  Not at all  It's fucking embarrassing  And unlistenable  Yeah  Yeah  He thinks he's really being  Endearing

[02:21:30]  That was the name of my  I was backwards man  Backwards man  Like Susan Smith was backwards man  Kid redeems himself  Hey is Patty and Sandy Cain here  Yes  Sandy Cain's here not Patty  He's got another costume  He can morph into quickly  Alright why don't you do that  Fat retard  Oh my god he's putting ketchup  That's E-Rock 
[02:22:00]  Why did you just tell us again  Who you are  Why would you fucking do that  What's wrong with you  Oh I didn't know how many guesses  To give you guys  How about one  I said you're putting ketchup in your mouth  And you said  Oh B-Rock  Yeah  Why didn't you  Oh my god  You gave us zero guesses  You gotta give us at least one guess  Alright do another costume  When you said you didn't know how many guesses to give us  What brought you to the conclusion that the answer should be zero 
[02:22:30]  None  None guesses  None guesses right  What the fuck  Well I wasn't sure how to do this  Because my sister accidentally spilled soda on my Halloween costume  As I was getting it out  Taking it out of the closet  What was it  Well I was gonna wear a Dharma Initiative jumpsuit  And dumbbell spilled soda on it  Yep  But they don't have to be clean  They were dirty Dharma Initiative guys  Well could've used it in your fucking thing  Go get another costume 
[02:23:00]  You're the dumber initiative  Bubba go get another costume  That's good  Exactly  Fucking John Lunkhead  Get out of here  Fucking  Where's  Ben minus IQ  Alright  Jimmy you missed  You missed a little fight that happened  While you were gone  I actually  How about Kenny and Mars  Yeah I got into a little bit of a brawl 
[02:23:30]  Yeah  An argument  Yeah Kenny calls Mars a rat  Why  He doesn't like him  So Sam got to the bottom of it  With a little backstage piece  That we're gonna play here  Wow  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  And now  Backstage with ONA  Here is Primetime  Sam Roberts  I'm Primetime  Sam Roberts  On the Opie and Anthony show  Learning challenged  Engineer  Mars  Royally pissed off 
[02:24:00]  The ONA security guard  Club Soda Kenny  I was reprimanded by Kenny  Why  For disturbing him  While he was eating his bagel  Oh  Where's he eating his bagel  In the office  Here comes Kenny  Let's talk about Mars  The cheese eating rat  Oh  Damn  Why don't you go back to the shop  And play with some switches  Oh  Oh shit  Little suck ass  Damn  What  Oh Kenny's eating his bagel  GH  Anthony he's sitting in the office 
[02:24:30]  A fucking cheese eater  The hostility followed the two  After they left the studio  As we spoke to Kenny  Following the confrontation  So Club Soda Kenny  You went in the studio today  And you kind of lost your cool  What happened in there?  About Mars  The cheese eating rat  What makes you think Mars is a rat?  What happened?  Didn't you see the way he ran in there  To suck up to Opie and Anthony?  You know how you know  When Mars is on the phone? 
[02:25:00]  How?  The cord is sticking out of Opie's ass  Why did you get so mad  When Mars came in to tell them  That you were eating a bagel?  I hate fucking tattletales  And that's what you think Mars is?  Yes  Mars the fucking brown noser  What do you think's worse?  Being a brown noser or being a rat?  The same difference  Six to one half dozen to the other  How about a brown nosing rat?  That's what he is 
[02:25:30]  Obviously  Club Soda felt slighted  That Mars took it upon himself  To tattle on him  We went to Mars for an explanation  So Mars  You went in there  You got real comfortable  In the studio today  And you thought you were going to  Throw someone under the bus  But you kind of got your ass  Reamed out  What happened?  Not at all  I was just stating the fact  And getting my ass reamed out  Hey  He has to say what he has to say  I have to give him his time  When did you decide  To become so comfortable  In the studio  That you were going to start 
[02:26:00]  You know  Trying to get people to come in  And doing all this  Aren't you really supposed  To just be making sure  The CD players are plugged in?  No not at all  I'm a well part of the show  And Opie gives me the eyes  And we talk  And he gives me that vibe  So  What?  I'm part of the team man  Opie gives you the eyes  And you guys have a vibe?  Well  With the show  You try to  You know  Grab Kenny out of the office  Then you try to  Kind of throw him under the bus  You look like a dick  Why do you think  It went so poorly for you 
[02:26:30]  Whereas for some of us  It goes so well  Well actually  I don't think  I look like a dick  I was helping the show  And I was not throwing  Kenny under the bus  I just went to get him  Then why is he so mad at you?  He's not mad  Hey Kenny  Are you mad at Mars?  Three blind mice  See how they run  They run after cheese  The cheese eating rat  What are you laughing at?  He's  It's  Whatever  Why don't you head back  To the engineering room  And do something 
[02:27:00]  Well watch out for the rat traps  Hopefully Mars is starting to grasp  Why many engineers  Never make it on the air  Mars  Why don't you make sure  All the CD players are plugged in  And leave the shit stirring  To the professionals  I'm Primes  I'm Sam Roberts  And this has been  Backstage  With ONA  Opie and Anthony  We've got Bobo  Bobo's ready with  His next costume  What do you like to
