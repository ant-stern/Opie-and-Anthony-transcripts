<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with the hosts mocking *Zookeeper* and Kevin James, followed by discussion of Anthony's internet hoax involving Casey Anthony.  They then critiqued Jason Alexander's Twitter feed,  launched into a furious rant about the Soup Nazi's poor service, and condemned a gay slur used in *Horrible Bosses*, debating the appropriateness of offensive language in comedy and criticizing GLAAD's response.  Justin Bieber's Twitter strategy and their disdain for Nancy Grace's media persona were also discussed, along with brief mentions of Tiki Barber, a Larry King interview with Daniel Radcliffe (mistakenly named Dennis), and the censorship of Dire Straits' "Money for Nothing."  The entire segment was peppered with crude humor, offensive language, and personal attacks.

The show continued with more sexually suggestive commentary about Casey Anthony's post-prison appearance and media coverage of her trial. A caller prompted a discussion of the Black Sabbath song "Fairies Wear Boots," and Opie recounted a funny anecdote about accidentally throwing away *Rescue Me*.  A segment teased a guest's pronunciation of "Cirque du Soleil," and the hosts discussed the arrest of a high school wrestling coach on child pornography charges,  further escalating into offensive commentary.  The hosts excitedly played clips of Chael Sonnen's interviews.  Studio guests Rich Vos and Bonnie McFarlane joined the discussion, engaging in a humorous and candid argument about their marriage, Rich's golf obsession, his thriftiness, and his right-wing political views.  This led to a humorous "Jew test" for Rich, based on his Star of David tattoo.  Comedian Tom Papa briefly joined, offering commentary on their dynamic.  The segment included plugs for Bonnie and Tom's upcoming performances and a "Couch of Zilches" segment with audience members.  Upcoming appearances by Brian Regan and Aaron Paul were also mentioned.

The next segment featured a chaotic interview with Aaron Paul.  It began with a caller about Long Island block parties and an interview with Eric, a college radio DJ.  Brian Finley, a fireman, also shared a humorous anecdote.  Aaron Paul then joined, discussing *Breaking Bad*, including behind-the-scenes details and the show's dark themes.  The conversation frequently involved jokes about meth. Rich Vos and Bonnie McFarlane continued to be involved, with Bonnie often the subject of jokes.  The interview took numerous tangents, including Aaron Paul's personal life, early career, and co-star Brian Cranston.  A strong smell of flatulence caused humorous accusations.  Aaron Paul's other work, including voice acting, was also discussed.  Amy Schumer unexpectedly joined, leading to more chaotic banter.  Rich Vos recounted a bad stand-up experience in Dubai, generating more jokes.

The final segment featured Amy Schumer as the main guest.  It began with a humorous anecdote about a golf game and her guest bartending gig in Dubai, detailing bizarre experiences, including a housekeeping employee walking in on her naked, and her interactions with the local crowd.  She discussed her volatile relationship, marked by public humiliation.  She also discussed performing for various audiences, including fully covered women. The segment included calls from a fireman and discussions about Opie blocking critics on Twitter. The conversation frequently returned to Schumer's Dubai experiences and personal life, including sexually explicit details.  The segment concluded with Schumer promoting her shows, mentions of Tom Papa and Tommy Davidson, and the show's wrap-up.

[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you.  Who's Jim Norton? 
[00:04:00]  Bought away.  Bought away.  That's got to be a lot louder.  Again?  Louder.  Oh, gosh.  No, I didn't mean to turn it to...  Keep it up.  Good morning.  Hi, everyone.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:04:30]  Oh, what an exhaustingly long week.  It's Tuesday, right?  I know, that's what it feels like.  I know, that's what it feels like, but no, indeed.  Fuck.  We get a good one.  Huh?  We get a good week.  Two days, boom, off.  Feel like someone special.  We got to Liv Howard's schedule for a week.  That was nice.  That was nice.  God damn, is this easy. 
[00:05:00]  God damn, is this easy.  Oh, who doesn't want this?  Of course.  Love it.  Work two days and then go on.  I got it from a...  Oh, what?  What?  What did you get from a Negro?  Oh, God.  Obviously, not my templates.  There they are.  Friday!  Yes.  Yes.  I'm bothered by Zookeeper.  I don't even know why.  The movie?  Yeah, they shoved that movie down our throats for the last, what, three or four months?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Fucking commercials everywhere and special little segments here and there and all kinds of marketing.  And it's a bomb-a-roo.  Oh, yes.  It's a stink-a-roo, as they say.  And no surprise here.  Of course it's going to be a horrible movie.  Mm-hmm.  I just don't get the Kevin James appeal.  I never got it.  Boy.  He's a nice guy.  I've seen him do stand-up.  He's kind of funny.  He's not the funniest stand-up I've ever seen.  Not even close, by the way.  Then he gets that King of Queens. 
[00:06:00]  King of Queens.  Does really well with that.  I've tried to watch that show in reruns.  I don't get that.  And then he does Mall Cop.  I didn't get that.  Then he did that movie with Adam Sandler.  Grown-ups.  I didn't get that.  He had to be the fat guy falling fucking down.  He's always the funny fat guy.  And now Zookeeper.  Hollywood just keeps throwing movies at this guy.  Yeah.  And I just don't understand the appeal.  This should have been a Rob Schneider movie.  Yeah, exactly.  Zookeeper.  Yeah, then there wouldn't have been a surprise.  Nah.  But, yeah. 
[00:06:30]  Because Rob Schneider is just in awful films.  I heard a review for this on the radio coming in.  One and a half stars.  That's kind.  I saw zero and one.  Zero.  In the New York papers today.  Nice.  Yeah.  Last night, that god-awful movie Hitch was on.  Oh, yeah.  He's in that one.  Oh, really?  And, yeah.  No, I mean, oh, really, as in, what am I trying to say?  Oh, really?  Like, oh, ugh, really?  It's another movie I had no desire to see.  Yeah, who cares?  Like, what is Hitch about? 
[00:07:00]  I didn't either.  I don't know.  It was on, like, something else was on before it.  It was on, but I was on the computer.  Yeah.  But I noticed, like, oh, Kevin James is in this.  And then, during the commercials, because it was on commercial TV, they would play, like,  these prolonged spots for a zookeeper.  Okay.  And, you know, do interviews with the cast.  I love when they do that with a movie.  They take one movie that someone's in, and then, in between all the commercials, they  have to talk about the new movie that they're in. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  Boy, that was great.  Made me want to run out and see it.  What was Hitch about?  I think, yeah, the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air there.  Will Smith is in it.  Yeah.  He, like, hooks people up with chicks.  Okay.  And that's all I got from it.  I don't know.  And Kevin James is one of the big stars in it?  He's one of the guys he's trying to hook up with a chick.  Really?  Because Hitch is like the man, you know.  He can hook up some stuff.  His last name is Hitch, and he... 
[00:08:00]  I don't know.  Hooks up people?  I couldn't have cared less that this was on.  Like, you ever have something on your television, but you're so busy doing something that you  don't even know what's going on?  Well, you were too busy trying to get Casey Anthony to the compound.  Oh, my God.  These fucking people are hilarious.  They honestly believe me and get angry, and it's addicting, because I just want to stop.  I just want to stop tweeting. 
[00:08:30]  I don't want to sit there and tweet all night.  But you read some stuff and just go, oh, my God, how am I not going to nail this person?  I got the overflow of your tweets.  Oh, really?  Is Anthony serious?  I'm like, I didn't even write him back.  I'm like, don't bother me with this dumb nonsense.  Are you crazy?  Not meaning your nonsense, because you're having a good time, and it's worth reading, obviously.  But the nonsense meaning that you're believing it, and now you have to ask me.  Leave me alone.  I'm like, really?  I don't deal with stupid people.  Is he going down to Florida to pick her up? 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm doing.  One asshole goes, are you and Jimmy going to do the show on the 16th?  Because Ann's going to be in Florida picking up Casey Anthony.  Yes, of course.  Yeah, I'm going down for the whole weekend.  Fucking idiots.  Yeah, they really don't get it.  I understand the rubes that you're fucking with.  I understand them biting and thinking that this whole thing is happening.  But people that have been listening to the show forever?  Some of the fans actually started saying, hey, are you serious? 
[00:09:30]  Right.  Is this a bit still?  Yeah.  No, Anthony's got Casey Anthony coming to his compound.  Yeah, yeah.  To party.  I want her over my house.  To party.  I mean, if you have a lot of money, you could probably get her there.  I probably could.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you're talking about, what, $4,000 and you're going to have Casey Anthony at the compound?  That's all I've got to pay.  Four Gs.  And she comes over.  If you want to throw her a million, she probably would show up.  Oh, she'd show up. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, for that.  They're talking about the money this broad's going to make now.  It's just unbelievable.  It's just hilarious watching these, especially just the house frows that pay attention to  this 24-7, as they say.  Right.  They hate me.  And it's great.  What are you?  You should.  And I was like, wow.  Because some of these people that are like, you know, justice for Kaylee and, oh, you know,  she's a murderer and everything.  They're the first ones to go like, you and her should get bullets in your fucking heads. 
[00:10:30]  It's like, oh, oh, really, Miss, you know, ooh, don't want a murderer to get out.  Right.  Some of the most vile, violent shit I've read has been from these housewives that are so  angry that this woman got out because they care about her child so much, but they're willing  to just throw out the worst murderous shit.  Well, you're not completely innocent in this one, sir.  Of course not.  You've been stirring the pot nicely.  Oh, yeah.  You stir the pot to the point where you're driving these people insane. 
[00:11:00]  I drive them to want to kill.  Right.  It's amazing.  They're just normal.  Yeah.  Fucking Orlando housewives.  And you got them to the point they want to kill.  Yeah.  You're absolutely right.  I caught wind of the news that she's getting out on the 17th instead of the 13th.  And I caught wind of that pretty, pretty early, like before anybody else did.  I think it was before CNN even picked it up.  Oh, yeah.  And I tweeted something real quick.  It's like, oh, she's getting out on the 17th.  We did that so we're able to fly into Kennedy because we couldn't get a flight out or something. 
[00:11:30]  And people are like, hey, dude, he knew it before anyone.  He posted this before any of the news organizations.  It's got to be true.  I'm like, of course it's true.  Dummies.  Like I said, I don't mind if people that don't know us or you are buying into it.  But, fuck, they started really believing it.  Yeah.  Hey, Chuck and Larry has to be added to the list, too. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, right.  Isn't that where he got married to another man?  So, basically, he had a very successful sitcom and he hasn't been in a good movie yet.  And you're able to just make shite movies.  And Hollywood continues to give him movies.  And Zookeeper will do just ridiculous business this weekend.  Even though in this world we live in now, everyone knows this movie sucks.  Everyone has to know.  Before you pay for your fucking ticket, most people know this movie sucks, but they'll still go and see it.  I don't understand that. 
[00:12:30]  Oh.  How starved for entertainment are you that you have to fucking still go and see this movie?  I guess marketing works.  Talking animal movies suck.  14% positive reviews, right?  Oh, yeah.  14%.  So, that's what?  One and a half reviews out of ten are good, more or less, right?  That's a good review.  Huh.  As far as complete wastes of time go, Zookeeper is not especially offensive. 
[00:13:00]  Wait, that's a positive review?  No, that's a negative.  Oh, you never know.  Yeah.  A positive review.  It's all very ho-hum, though.  James, who's like Jason Alexander, with a touch of Jeremy Piven, is still a schmo you can't help rooting for.  That's a positive review.  That's positive, by the way.  Carefully worded.  Very.  Because they want to save their ass.  It's carefully worded to be a positive review, but you can say, look, I never said one good thing about it. 
[00:13:30]  You know what we should do with these reviews on Rotten Tomatoes?  If we read that last review and then went to the phones?  Oh, see.  I bet you half the people would say it was a negative review.  Now, was that a positive or negative?  Right.  So, I don't know.  Speaking of Jason Alexander, of course we know George from Seinfeld.  Hilarious.  Wow, his Twitter.  Oh, really?  Still. 
[00:14:00]  And I can't stop following.  It's so incredibly bad.  And he's so incredibly good as George.  I want George.  I don't want Jason Alexander to tweet.  I want George Costanza to tweet.  Well, this is what he's made of right here.  That's the real guy.  And I don't want the real guy.  Let's read a few of these.  We're getting him followers, by the way.  His numbers are going up because we've been talking about him. 
[00:14:30]  He's up to, what, almost 46,000.  You want to read a few of these?  So far, a good day for me in poker land.  Let's see how the evening fares.  I guess he's playing poker.  Thanks to all who checked me out on Franklin and Bash.  Keep watching.  Think it's a show with legs.  Thanks for the kind words.  Show with legs, Franklin, and Bash.  Look, we had the two guys in here.  That show looks stink-a-roo.  We didn't even have a desire to watch it. 
[00:15:00]  No.  But those two tweets are just awful.  No, his jokes, though, are the worst.  But that type of banality of that information.  Who gives a shit?  Banality.  It's amazing.  I love that word, by the way.  It is a good one.  It was used perfectly right there.  It's a hard one to squeeze in.  Banality.  Get to a joke.  Wait, wait, wait.  I think we got to get a joke here.  Well, how do you know where the jokes are?  I have no idea.  Oh, he's got some Casey Anthony stuff. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, he's got some Casey Anthony.  So we should see what that's about.  Keep going up until we know where it begins.  Yeah.  Is it where the verdict?  Verdict seems the child killed herself, crawled into a bag, and flung herself into swamp.  No one is guilty.  Justice served.  Party on, Casey.  Party on.  Like, one of mine.  Mm-hmm.  What was the other one with the big...  Don't know what to think.  No way all those lawyers allow 12 stupid people on jury. 
[00:16:00]  You idiot.  I wish we knew the thinking.  Maybe one will speak up.  They weren't idiot jurists.  Why are people getting the facts wrong?  I know.  It sucks, but the jury did exactly what they were supposed to do.  Why isn't anyone saying this?  The jury came out and said, look, we wanted to find it guilty.  We really did.  They didn't prove their fucking case.  Jason Alexander, you're smarter than that.  They didn't give us enough.  No. 
[00:16:30]  He apparently isn't.  That's what you're getting at, right?  Yeah.  Go way down, because I want to find some jokes where he just kind of goes off.  Like, it was my favorite thing about holiday weekends, a 48-hour respite from the soul-sucking L.A. traffic.  Alas.  That has no impact on you.  Good, bad, or indifferent.  It literally is just like someone just said random words.  Pebbles, flowers, coffee. 
[00:17:00]  It's the same as that to me.  And at one point, he wrote something to the effect of, it was Independence Day, you know.  Right.  And he goes, and no one's going to kill independent George.  Like, this was one of his little catchphrases on the show once.  What is it?  How do we know?  Who wrote for him?  Whoever wrote for him should...  Larry David.  A team of writers.  But he should pay those guys a few bucks. 
[00:17:30]  Or I should follow those guys.  Yeah, follow those guys.  Do you follow some of the Hollywood writers?  They're great to follow.  I should.  They're great to follow.  Hold on.  I got to take care of something.  Bobo.  Oh, God.  Bobo.  Wait, I'm here.  What do you want?  Leave me the fuck alone.  That he seats are...  Christ, enough with the Bobo.  Now you see.  Leave me the fuck alone.  What was he going to say?  He's still trying to get me to go to a stupid Mets game. 
[00:18:00]  When is the game?  Maybe I could get him on the railing and throw a fucking foul ball at him.  Small plane intercepted by Air Force F-16 was being flown by a man trying to impress a woman.  And he sexted on takeoff.  What?  What?  I don't know.  Does that mean that he came quick?  Is that like a come quick?  I don't know.  Is that like an announcement?  Like a...  You know, he sexted on takeoff. 
[00:18:30]  It's like when you come and you put it...  I don't know.  I'm trying to find some reason I could possibly care about it.  I'm so excited about Canada Day.  This one's my favorite.  This is...  You know, this is the real George right here.  Oh, yeah.  Thank God you're finally getting it with this tweet.  Oh, of course.  I'm so excited about Canada Day.  That's when everyone gets free ginger ale, right?  Happy holiday, Northern brethren.  What?  Huh?  There are so many fucking Canadian jokes you can make.  These are horrendous.  You made a ginger ale joke? 
[00:19:00]  Jason Alexander is not George Costanza, and it's upsetting to me.  He's not even George Washington on Twitter.  It's terrible.  He's not funny.  He's not a funny guy.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  Go back one.  The original soup man who was satirized as the soup Nazi, but the term Nazi is aberrant  to Al, and that should be respected.  Yeah.  What?  What? 
[00:19:30]  The word, I think, is abhorrent.  Oh, abhorrent.  Wow.  Look at me.  The original soup man.  Abhorrent.  Who we satirize as the soup Nazi.  I guess he's answering a question.  Oh.  But the term Nazi is abhorrent to Al, and that should be respected.  Horrendous.  I guess he, um...  Who cares what is abhorrent to him?  How about this?  Nobody cares about your dumb soup if you're not on Seinfeld.  Right.  You fucking cranky soup cunt. 
[00:20:00]  Fuck that soup guy.  I've had more than my share of him.  Cranky soup cunt.  And his fucking cranky soup cunt franchises.  No one cares about your bisque.  Bobo just put me in a bad mood for a half hour or so.  Oh, wow.  Let's let it fly, man.  Got some power.  That fucking soup guy is an asshole.  How much money did he spend on our stupid show, and he wouldn't give us the goddamn chili  every day?  Wouldn't give us the good soup.  He gave us, like, pea soup.  This piece of shit guy started a franchise.  Let's get into this for a second.  Yeah.  And he had soup stores all over Manhattan, and he needed us badly at the time. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  So we make a deal.  Bring us soup.  Just bring us some soup.  Anthony loves soup.  I don't mind soup.  Oh, who doesn't like soup?  You bring in the soup.  We'll eat the soup.  We'll talk about your soup.  Guess what?  More people will be buying your soup.  This cheap fuck only gave us the soups that weren't selling that great.  Yeah.  The horrid pea soup.  Was it pea soup?  I remember there was some kind of broccoli soup in there.  Yeah, yeah.  And then we'd go to his people, like, stop and make sure you bring us the chili. 
[00:21:00]  We all want the turkey chili.  I want just basic chicken noodle even was good.  But the chili soup was so valuable to this soup cunt that he wouldn't bring it in every  morning.  So we continue with the horrible soups.  One year.  Huh?  No soup for you.  One year.  Guess what happened to his soup fucking business?  Down the shitter.  Absolutely.  Exactly.  No mulligatani for you.  All he had to do was bring in the chili and we would have...  I know.  We would have helped him in his dumb fucking soup. 
[00:21:30]  Ah.  Enough with the soup Nazis.  Cirque du Soleil keeps calling me about doing the Elvis show.  I keep telling them, I'm Ringo, man.  I'm Ringo.  What is he talking about?  What is the connection there besides music?  But, I mean, that's a loose connection.  But this is what upsets me about these tweets.  And I'm obsessed with them.  I can't stop reading them.  And why would you admit you're the one guy in the Beatles that did nothing? 
[00:22:00]  Turn it up a little bit so I can read.  I want to have a laugh here.  George is a great character.  He's funny.  Casey Blago, Wiener, Bulger, or Bulger, Casey Blago, Wiener, Bulger, death ceiling, gay  marriage, Middle East.  What the hell happened to Charlie Sheen?  Question mark, question mark, question mark, exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation  point, exclamation point, exclamation point.  Oh, I get it here.  It's a shocked question statement.  What the fuck is tweeting about Charlie Sheen these days? 
[00:22:30]  Maybe a little bit because of that roast thing that was announced.  Are they roasting him?  Yeah, Comedy Central is.  I wouldn't know.  Why would you?  Why would I?  We love you, Jim.  Do you really?  Fuck Comedy Central.  I got 28 minutes left in my bad mood.  Fuck Comedy Central.  Fuck the Soup Nazi.  Fuck Bobo.  Fuck Kevin James.  Fuck the Zookeeper.  We love you, Jim.  And fuck Jason Alexander.  And take care of Jim Norton.  Will never happen. 
[00:23:00]  And I don't mind if they came out and just said, we don't really like Jim.  I would really respect that.  I wouldn't like it, but I'd respect it.  Yeah.  But my manager, he's such a gullible fucking guy.  Oh, they love you.  Jim, they're big fans.  I'm like, shut up.  They're not.  They're not.  They tell you that because they show business.  Everybody's a coward.  Yes.  Nobody's going to say to you, and this is none of them.  We don't like Jim.  Yeah.  Oh, big fans.  And then he runs to meet a big fan.  They're not.  No.  You fucking parrot.  They don't like you.  They don't. 
[00:23:30]  Why wouldn't they invite you to a roast?  You're a great guy at a roast.  What the fuck?  I'm at least better than one roast in 10 years.  Yes, please.  They'd rather get the situation.  I've seen some shit.  They'd rather get the sitch instead of Jim Norton.  The shit situation.  Because they really care about comedy and being funny.  Oh, please.  They got the situation instead of Jimmy and a bunch of other guys you would put on that  list.  Ugh.  Dopes.  The Ringo reference is from Seinfeld, Dan.  You should have known that. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, I'm saying, like, why is he doing that?  The Caspian and the Beatles.  Yeah, but why is he doing that?  Why is he saying Cirque du Soleil?  Asked to be Elvis?  Who are the top four characters in Seinfeld?  What do you mean?  Who are they?  Jerry?  Jerry, Elaine, Kramer, and George.  Okay, so who's who?  I would definitely, I'd put Kramer as Ringo.  Kramer as Ringo.  Wow.  I would put fucking Elaine as Ringo. 
[00:24:30]  Elaine?  Who's Lennon?  Who's McCartney?  You got to go with Jerry.  Jerry is McCartney.  Absolutely.  Paul McCartney.  And George would be the Lennon.  Yeah, yeah.  So why is he saying he's the Ringo?  I don't know why.  Hey, asshole, you're the fucking John Lennon.  On the show, he is integral.  And then Kramer would be more of a George Harrison.  George, you think?  Yes.  He's poking fun at himself, I guess.  A little jabby through himself. 
[00:25:00]  Elaine's great on the show.  She's fucking hilarious.  Oh, they're all hilarious.  They're all hilarious.  I'm just saying.  Does anyone else tweet?  Does Kramer tweet?  Oh, boy.  I think they told him pretty much to lay low.  This guy wants to put us in our place about Jason Alexander.  I don't know if this is a joke.  I'm not in the mood for stupid, dumb jokes.  Danny, go ahead, buddy.  25 minutes left in the bed.  The only thing I'm saying is, I don't understand.  I think Jason Alexander's a very funny guy. 
[00:25:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Let's, because I don't even know if you're going for a joke.  He's not funny.  The point is, Anthony has brought up his Twitter to our attention.  Yes.  Proving the guy isn't funny.  He knows how to be funny on TV when someone else is writing for him.  We get the same shit in here.  You get a comedian that knows how to put 15 or 20 minutes together and is really funny  on a stage, but he's not a funny person.  I'm in traffic all the time. 
[00:26:00]  It made me laugh my ass off.  I was really, really amused by it.  What?  What's that?  What are you talking about?  And then he hangs up.  Sir, why'd you hang up?  Why'd you hang up?  We were arguing with you.  We could argue with anybody.  That's fine.  We don't even know what you said.  Don't do that woman stuff and just hang up.  Yeah.  Was he being serious about Jason Alexander?  I don't know.  Who knows?  Because with Anthony pointing out his Twitter, it proves the guy's not a funny guy. 
[00:26:30]  His Twitter's just really funny.  He knows how to be funny when he's in a sitcom and people are writing for him.  Of course.  He was on Seinfeld and he was great on it.  Yes.  Stop.  A classic television character.  But you realize that the people behind the scenes had a lot more to do with it than  Jason Alexander's funny fucking brain.  There was a lot of writing going on there.  I think Jerry and Larry David spent a lot of time sitting there writing things out, getting  the writers involved.  Right.  Yep.  Green Lantern. 
[00:27:00]  If you had the powers, would you really make green images of something?  I guess lanterns must have no fear and big imaginations.  See, that could absolutely be a chip, but that was a Jason Alexander.  Let me say hi to Matt in Canada.  Matt.  We go on in about 20 minutes, but I was just flipping around some websites and I got  to the Islanders' website this morning and guess who's on the front page? 
[00:27:30]  Kevin James.  Well, he's a big Long Islander, so.  Yeah.  Well, he's showing his support for the arena this morning, so.  Well, I mean, you know, God bless him for doing that.  I'm just not a fan of Kevin James.  I know he's a nice guy.  I've met him because Adam Ferrara used to do stand up with him, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They came up together, as they say.  I met the guy.  He's really nice, but I just don't get Kevin James and the movies he's in.  And I guess, in all fairness, The Zookeeper is probably a kid's movie. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  I would think it is.  But now that I'm a parent, I get this a little more.  You have to bring your kids to these fucking movies and suffer.  Yeah.  So how about you make it kind of entertaining for adults, too?  Go to movies and make you suffer.  Hey, what are you guys talking about on the off-season?  Well, there's never an off-season.  There's always somebody getting signed, somebody getting hired, somebody getting hired.  That's that niche shit.  No one playing, though.  Yeah, that's that niche shit.  Nobody playing.  But you know what?  We could be the NFL.  What do you think of the Islanders this year? 
[00:28:30]  They're still so far away.  I mean, there's still such a young group of guys.  The DiPietro thing, that's just an anchor on that team, which is too bad.  Because I like DiPietro.  He's a good guy.  But you've got to love their chances.  You've got to love their chances.  The DiPietro signing will go down as one of the worst decisions in hockey.  The guy had all the talent in the world.  The Islanders signed him to, what, 15 years, sir?  Yeah, it's about that.  And we've got about 12 years left, and he's a broken goalie. 
[00:29:00]  This guy is broken.  You're still paying for it.  You've got the trading away of guys like Spezza, the trading away of Luongo, the trading away of Zidane O'Chara.  All guys that have had relative success elsewhere.  You don't have to remind me of all the guys we got rid of that became stars.  I know it too well.  So hope.  All right, brother.  Well, have a good show today.  Thanks a lot.  Take care.  All right.  Bye.  Michael Jackson's Thriller jacket sells for $1.8 million. 
[00:29:30]  And his boxers went for a cool $750,000.  I'm selling my socks.  We read that one last week.  Yeah, yeah.  Can we go to the top, the brand newest ones?  Yeah, you need the newer ones.  Just the brand newest ones, Sam.  Some of them are serious, but there's times where he decides to make a poignant.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Poignant.  I met him once.  He was very pleasant, as they were loud in the back of the fucking L.A. Friars Club.  Oh, really?  Yeah, but they were playing poker.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Let me see the top here. 
[00:30:00]  What's the first one?  Oh, yeah.  World Series of Poker, day one.  My journey to glory heaven.  Help me.  Here we go.  Oh, he's in the World Series of Poker.  Something.  He is a big poker player.  Thanks to all watch Franklin and Bash tonight.  Had a blast playing Carter.  And love Brecklin and Mark Paul.  Hope they see many seasons or something.  Do you think Franklin and Bash is going to be one of those multi-season hit shows? 
[00:30:30]  I don't know.  They are crazy.  Oh, boy.  They're wild.  I see the ads for it.  They got their shirts on, dress shirts, and their ties, but their jackets are off.  They're not wearing pants, and they're in a hot tub.  Stop it.  They're wild.  Crazy guys.  Who would ask guys like that to do legal things?  Oh, please.  Those are your...  That's your lawyers that you want right there.  What's his name?  Spitzer shows off the air. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, Spitzer's done.  Five months.  Well, it was horrible.  Yeah.  No one wanted to look at him, first of all.  He had no charisma.  Yeah.  No.  No charisma.  Horrible to watch and listen to.  Yes.  The man is dull.  He's a dullard.  He really is not.  He hasn't had a lot of spunk or pizzazz.  They'll probably sign Wiener.  They'll probably go...  Yeah, let's get another fucking sexual deviant.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Oh, it's horrible. 
[00:31:30]  Is that somebody's Twitter that isn't quite funny?  Yeah, I don't know if we should fucking pull up his spot.  It's fucking horrible.  Probably got a lot of followers, right?  Yeah, but another horrible Twitter.  Let people try to figure it out out there.  It's funny.  Dana said, and this is unrelated, that Justin Timberlake just retweeted him and he got 50,000 fucking followers.  Was that on the air or off the air?  Off the air.  Dana was saying that Justin retweeted something.  Like, they were hanging out watching the fights.  It wasn't Timberlake.  No, I meant... 
[00:32:00]  Bieber.  I apologize.  Bieber.  Oh, yeah.  Justin Bieber.  Because Dane Cook said, fuck Justin Timberlake.  No, Dana White said that.  I mean, Dana White.  Now I'm all fucked up with the Danas.  God, now we're all over the place.  All right.  Figure that one out.  Dana White...  Dana White...  ...said that Justin Bieber retweeted him.  Right.  They were watching the fights, him and his father and Dana.  And Dana got like 50,000 new followers.  He said he shut his BlackBerry off.  Yeah.  Because he had fucking...  That's... 
[00:32:30]  Because he has 11 million followers.  Yeah.  And they were all active probably Twitter.  Just because the Biebs...  Was hanging with him.  No.  Yeah, responded and everything.  The best part of the story that Dana White told was Bieber said to him, because Bieber realized  that Dana White was taking care of him and stuff and they got along, Bieber said to Dana  White, I'm gonna tweet you, you tweet me back.  And then he said, watch what happens.  He knows the power of his Twitter and was trying to take care of Dana White because Dana  White was doing the right thing for him. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Damn.  And then, yeah, Dana said 50,000 new followers instantly and his BlackBerry fucking basically  blew up.  But Justin Bieber is following 116,000 people?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's smart.  Who is he following?  It really is.  No, it's smart.  It is, man.  Really?  Yes, because every one of those people thinks they're special and he's never read one of  their tweets.  It's really smart.  10 million, almost 11 million followers.  I'm starting to put my followers into categories because I can't keep up with what people are 
[00:33:30]  writing anymore because I'm following too many people and I'm only around, I don't know,  100 or something.  Yeah, that's really smart.  They're all little girls and they're thinking, holy shit, Bieber knows who I am.  So they'll be active to talk to him.  Oh, is that it?  They'll be active.  They'll be pushing his shit.  Punch up his followers there.  I just want to get like a gist.  Who he's following or his followers?  Or who he's following.  Yeah, I mean who's, yeah, who he's following.  But it's going to be, you know, his audience for the most part. 
[00:34:00]  Is it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Really?  Some girl in China lost her virginity at 13.  Her name was some young hoe.  Is that really somebody that Justin Bieber's following?  Why, that's offensive.  Fucking people.  Wow.  And how many followers does that person have because Justin Bieber?  Not many.  Most people don't care. 
[00:34:30]  It was that he tweeted and backed it to her friends.  That's it?  2,000?  Yeah, no one cares.  He follows you.  Wow, that's odd.  Well, with 116 people.  Someone's got a red nose.  Come here.  I know.  It's still there.  Don't you guide my sleigh tonight?  Your nose looks horrible.  It is really bad.  It does hurt.  Yeah.  Fucking hell, man.  Oh, God.  Yeah, the pain.  You need some clear rubbed on it?  Some clear liquid?  Yeah, some clear liquid.  If you could come up with some. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, I can.  I'm a secretor.  Yeah, I woke up and it was like blood on the pillow.  Oh.  I must have like turned my head.  And raked it.  Yeah.  So where are we at?  Zookeeper's going to be a shitty movie.  Yeah.  Jason Alexander has a shitty Twitter.  What else did we do?  A shitty Twitter.  He really does.  The soup Nazi.  Him and his soup fucking sucks. 
[00:35:30]  Hey, I saw some tweet that was directed to you about the faggot line.  Oh, right.  I told you that was going to happen.  Yeah.  Horrible bosses.  Horrible bosses.  That was the movie.  Horrible bosses, you know, we keep it pretty honest on this show.  I like the movie a lot.  I think it's going to do very well.  Is it out yet or no?  It comes out today.  Okay.  And it's getting average reviews.  But I still stand by the movie.  I like it as far as a mainstream comedy goes. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  But Jennifer Aniston's category calls Charlie Day, don't be a faggot or something like that.  I forgot the exact.  Huh?  Jennifer Aniston's category.  Oh, this is character.  We are, by the way.  I'm tired today.  We are all fucking up today.  I'm tired today.  What is the deal?  Jennifer Aniston's character.  Thank you, Anthony.  Calls Charlie Day a little faggot or something.  Yeah, we're a little faggot.  Because he won't have sex with her.  Right.  But he has a fiance in the movie.  He's trying to do the right thing. 
[00:36:30]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And when I saw that scene, it stood out.  I'm like, oh, boy.  They're going to have problems with this fucking thing.  There's trouble.  I don't give a fuck, obviously.  And guess what?  No one should give a fuck about this, especially in a comedy.  You know the deal.  We've said it a million times.  But they're already trying to cause problems.  Jen Aniston's fell in love with raunchy role despite character's gay slur.  Oh, slur.  There's a gay slur in there. 
[00:37:00]  Can someone read that?  I can't see from my angle.  It's down at the bottom, I think.  Oh, there it is.  Do you want to read that?  I'm trying to find the spot where she actually...  It says, I love the script.  Is that what you mean?  Yeah, horrible.  It's down even further.  By the dot, dot, dot.  Yeah.  But Aniston's sexually inappropriate character has also ignited some controversy.  In one scene, Dr. Harris calls her dental assistant a gay slur. 
[00:37:30]  And then it says in quotes,  You're starting to sound like a little F.  Asterisk, asterisk, asterisk, asterisk, asterisk, asterisk, asterisk.  Hey, if you're reporting this as news, why can't they say the word?  Yeah, just write the word down.  Why do they have to fucking blur it out?  Yeah.  Fox is awful for that.  They really are.  Then don't do the story.  Gay slurs, even under the umbrella of comedy, don't always sit well in Hollywood.  They never sit well in Hollywood.  No.  They're not supposed to sit well.  Exactly.  It's a comedy.  It's supposed to throw you off guard, you idiots. 
[00:38:00]  Read the next line.  It's even worse.  Yeah, yeah.  Last year, GLAAD, of course the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Affirmation,  demanded that Universal remove the trailer for Vince Vaughn's comedy The Dilemma  and edit out a line calling electric cars gay.  The organizers' outcry had Hollywood taking sides.  See, what bothers me is it's a funny line. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  She won't be penalized personally, though.  No.  Like, Tracy had to apologize, but she can say that because, once again, even though there's  a little flack over it, the actors and actresses are completely, they have carte blanche because  it's under the guise of, well, it was written, so they said it.  Right.  But meanwhile, everybody knows that Jennifer Anderson has enough juice.  If she didn't want to say that line, she absolutely could have had it taken out.  Oh, hell yeah.  If she went, look.  She has enough power to do that. 
[00:39:00]  If she said, I'm not going to say that.  I'm not saying that.  I want that line out.  It's out.  Certain people on her level have that kind of power.  And I respect the fact she said it.  It's a funny line.  She should have said it.  But fucking glad, you just got to stop fucking with comedies.  Yeah.  You have to stop.  You have to realize that you are a group of people who are parodiable.  You're make-funable.  Yeah.  Just like blacks are.  Just like Jews are.  Just like Christians are.  Just like fucking Muslims are.  Enough.  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  Do you really think that you're not make-funable anymore?  You're off-limits, that there's nothing to make fun of in the gay community at all.  And stop thinking that saying that electric cars are gay fosters the environment that got  Michael Shepard, I'm sorry, Matthew Shepard beaten to death.  It doesn't.  No.  You idiots.  It does not.  It would just go, yeah, electric cars are gay.  And they don't think, gay?  Why?  Let me go out and beat a homosexual.  No.  And the sin that they commit by doing that is deep down they know that.  Deep down they know there is a difference between, ah, that's gay, and let's drag this 
[00:40:00]  kid and beat him to death.  Yeah.  But they fucking hijack that.  They hijack that.  And then they use it to kind of, to get other things talked about and listened to that they  just don't like.  And electric cars are gay.  Yeah.  Of course they are.  Of course they are.  It's the perfect way to explain electric cars.  Park in the rear of the garage.  That doesn't mean they're having, it doesn't mean electric cars are having sex with each  other.  But you understand the line, electric cars are gay. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  What the fuck?  But you can't say that because Glad just sucks.  It describes electric cars perfectly.  Yeah.  Maybe they'll, they'll make them, uh, dare I say cooler or whatever, but right now electric  cars are kind of, kind of gay.  Some guy said it was gay and that bothered them.  Right.  They're fucking so hypersensitive and they never respond to Fox.  I don't think.  I mean, I know Gutfeld has said to me, he's invited them on.  Oh yeah.  To debate and they just refuse. 
[00:41:00]  They like a rigged game.  Like every other fucking vomit inducing special interest group.  And I'm sorry, I'm almost done.  I apologize to the listeners.  No, this is great.  Not the same shit they've been hearing every week.  Uh, is they want a rigged game.  They want you at their podium, at their microphone, with their people surrounding you, with your  statement prepared.  They never want to just go back and forth and have a real discussion about freedom  and language.  They're fucking horrible.  They want you apologizing on their turf.  Yeah.  I can't believe they, they don't even show the word as they're reporting the story. 
[00:41:30]  No.  You can't say faggot.  That's how crazy we're getting.  It started with nigger.  You can't say nigger.  You can't say midget.  You can't say faggot.  You can't say anything.  Retard.  Retard.  None of these are FCC violations.  Here we go, boys.  Here we go.  Eric in New Hampshire wants in desperately.  Eric, go ahead.  Yo, what's going on?  Hi, Eric.  Hey.  Yo, uh, I'm not really trying to argue it.  I'm just saying, like, wouldn't you, couldn't you pose that?  Like, saying faggot is the same as saying the N-bomb?  I don't know. 
[00:42:00]  What do you mean?  I'm not sure what you mean.  Like, I'm just saying, like, in comedy, like, if, if Anderson were to say, like, was  to drop the N, like, the N-word.  Well, it's, you can say the word nigger, sir.  We're disgusting.  We're not children.  There's a way to say it when you're not being gratuitous.  Well, you're not, and I'm not yelling at you, you raise a point.  It's like, look, if I was gay, and hey, boy, am I deluding myself?  But, you know what I mean?  I can see why gay people hate that word and why they find it offensive.  But let's be real honest with each other.  They're both offensive words. 
[00:42:30]  But the word nigger has had a much heavier connotation historically, and it's had a much more, there's  no way in the schoolyard, like, two guys are playing basketball, and one guy misses a shot  and his buddy goes, come on, you nigger, make this, it just doesn't, it's used racially  and horribly.  Faggot is used a lot differently.  I got knocked out for that.  You know what I mean, sir?  Yeah.  But I think his point is, I think he could use the N-word in a comedy.  I think Jennifer Aniston could have, you know.  It's been used in a lot of comedy.  Yeah, and I would have laughed at a line like that. 
[00:43:00]  It has been, yeah.  You know, stop being a, you know, I choose not to say the word.  And you wouldn't say, you wouldn't say, see, the reason that it works here is you wouldn't  say, oh, don't be a nigger, you don't want to fuck me.  That's why, like, you couldn't just replace the words, because that nigger seems so harsh.  Right.  But in context of comedies I've seen it in, Faggot wouldn't have worked.  Right.  In certain times where...  This line, because I saw the movie.  It works.  It got a huge laugh.  How about in Blazing Saddles?  One more move and the faggot gets it. 
[00:43:30]  Right.  Wouldn't work because it was a black sheriff.  Yeah, and every time it's used in Blazing Saddles, it's hysterical.  Yes.  It's hilarious.  Huh?  Are you thinking of it?  I don't know which line that is.  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't know.  You all right?  No, I completely agree with you guys.  I know I'm not all right today.  I'm tired.  He had a flirtation.  Poor guy.  All right.  All right, brother.  Hey, thanks, guys.  No, I love you guys.  I totally agree. 
[00:44:00]  Of course you do.  Yes, you do.  We know you do.  Thank you, sir.  Everyone loves us.  Yes.  Let's get past that.  Oh, my God.  See the little Harry Potter and the new Harry Potter.  Wow, he's been doing that a long-ass time.  Holy shit.  Larry King interviewed who?  Harry?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Larry King got a nice Harry Potter special.  Yeah, he interviewed like everybody.  This is one of his big CNN specials.  It's a big get.  Getting to the bottom of Harry Potter.  How was it?  This is where CNN goes, look, we got to do something with him. 
[00:44:30]  There he is talking about.  Well, because he's still under contract.  Yeah, yeah.  They're like, I'll just throw him up on.  They give him a few specials.  They're putting it on on Sunday.  Sunday, really?  Yeah.  When Locked Up Abroad is on.  Some prison fucking special.  Love that.  No one's watching CNN on a Sunday is my point.  No.  No one's watching CNN almost any time, really.  Fucking Jesus.  Spitzer was doing.  Why would they have him against O'Reilly? 
[00:45:00]  Well, they're trying to find someone that could take on O'Reilly.  Obviously a dumb move by CNN, but they're trying to find someone that could compete with O'Reilly.  O'Reilly does three million viewers, and Spitzer did less than 300,000.  That's unbelievable.  We're doing more than 300,000.  Oh, yeah, of course.  And we're not CNN.  Nancy Grace beat Fox the other night.  Yeah.  Well, apparently a dead baby is great for ratings.  Yeah, on HLN.  Yeah, but that's one of those.  Oh, it's a fluke.  That's going to happen.  That's gone once this whole trial thing is over. 
[00:45:30]  But O'Reilly consistently does three million.  Yeah.  The thing with, and this is, nobody wants to hear this, but the reason Fox is so successful  is if there were three Foxes, and like there are other networks, Fox would be diluted.  Yeah.  Like, you wouldn't have as many O'Reilly viewers because people could kind of get that point  of view from another network.  Because Fox is a real conservative place.  Yeah.  The disadvantage to having the media be predominantly liberal is that there's a lot more choices  for people to watch that type of commentary. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  So they go to five different places.  Fox is the one source.  I don't know why that's so hard for people to understand.  Yeah, you want to go to CNN or MSNBC or CBS.  Yeah, there's other places to go.  The regular news.  With that said, Spitzer was supposed to do better.  Oh, absolutely.  They were hoping he was going to do better.  Yeah.  That's why.  Damn it.  What?  What?  What happened?  I don't know.  It was an interracial couple.  Who was the guy, though?  Was that the guy from Good Morning America or something?  That's the dude that came back to football there.  Plaxico?  Plaxico?  No.  I forgot his name.  I'm really tired today. 
[00:46:30]  I know who you mean.  The running back that had to come back to football because he's going through a horrible  divorce and ran out of money.  Oh, shit.  Help me out.  What's his name?  Look down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They know.  I know who you mean.  They know.  It's not.  He has a twin brother.  He was on the morning show.  He just left his wife when she was pregnant.  Yeah, all that.  Tiki?  Tiki Barber.  Yeah, thank you.  He's a running back?  Tiki Barber.  I don't know football.  Tiki Barber.  Good old Tiki Barber was with a white.  Wow.  He was with the whitest white woman ever.  Yeah, that's athlete pussy. 
[00:47:00]  Ever.  Yeah, absolutely athlete pussy.  Mm-hmm.  Jesus.  Yeah, that's him.  So Larry King did a Harry Potter interview and then fucked up.  Yeah, yeah.  This is a quickie.  Yeah.  Love hearing this.  Character in Harry Potter do you most identify with?  I did a great special.  It's on Sunday night.  Yeah, I know.  I'm making it a movie and the whole thing.  I love the kid.  Dennis is a great guy.  Are you a fan of the movie?  Oh, I like him.  Yeah.  Really?  Fucking dumb TMZ reporter. 
[00:47:30]  Dennis.  Doesn't even realize that the guy said Dennis instead of Daniel.  It's Daniel Radcliffe and he called him Dennis.  Daniel the Menace.  I love that kid, Dennis.  He only has one N.  He's on Rescue Me.  No, wrong.  Wrong guy.  You know who fucked up?  Rich Voss fucked up.  Oh, he did.  Instead of saying Casey Anthony, he said, I hear Casey Anderson was found not guilty.  Casey Anderson.  Ah, let me explain. 
[00:48:00]  Ah.  Casey Anderson.  There it is.  I just heard Casey Anderson is not guilty.  Come on now.  That's Rich Voss' tweet.  And why did he tweet that only five hours ago?  Because he just found out.  Is he that far behind as far as the news goes?  Oh, he probably is.  That's three days ago now.  Yeah.  Casey Anderson?  Casey Anderson.  Casey Anderson.  Ah.  Well, let's be open-minded.  I mean, is he going for a joke there?  I don't know. 
[00:48:30]  He is coming into me.  You can't really tell with Rich.  We'll have to ask him.  Oh, he is.  Okay.  Yes.  Because can't you just delete that and change it?  Especially if it's your last tweet that you've made?  Stryker.  I don't know how that works.  Stryker.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hello.  Hey, you know, this was brought up several months ago that the 80s channel, when they  were censoring, when Canada announced that the 80s channel started censoring money for  nothing.  When you guys had Nina Blackwood in last week, you should have asked her why they're censoring 
[00:49:00]  it on the 80s channel.  Do you think she has anything to do with the fact that they're censoring the little faggot's  got his own jet airplane out of, yeah, that song?  Come on.  She's just trying to make sure she breathes properly.  She doesn't care about money for nothing.  Oh, my God.  That little faggot has his own jet airplane.  Jet airplane.  The little faggot.  He's a millionaire.  And they edit that part out.  Not just on the 80s channel here, though. 
[00:49:30]  I've heard it edited out on other stations.  Yeah, faggot's a bad word now, man.  Yeah.  Free Wine plays the full version, and Classic Vinyl plays the full version.  They don't edit it.  But the 80s channel...  Cool, man.  They're rebels.  Yeah, they sure are.  Just leave our music alone, please.  Just leave our language alone.  Just leave everything alone.  Money for Nothing was played on the radio millions and millions of times, and no one had a problem 
[00:50:00]  with the word.  And then some dumb person thought it might be a problem, and decided to edit it.  Never thought of it.  There was never a fucking problem or a thought behind the use of that word in that song.  Never thought of it as an issue.  Who are these people?  Who are these people?  Who are they, really?  We all walk around in our dumb little lives, and I don't run into people that are having  a problem with the word.  No.  Especially when it's used like that.  No. 
[00:50:30]  Remember when we used to play fag talk back in the old days?  Love fag talk.  Fag.  Now put that fag in your mouth and just suck it.  Suck on that fag.  We got one of those?  That was...  We could go to break with that.  That was the old days.  And boy, they didn't care.  They didn't care.  Want to hear one of these going into break?  Yeah, why not?  Did you see John King's interview with Nancy Grace?  It was a funny interview.  John King is another fucking bore. 
[00:51:00]  And Nancy Grace is just a vulture.  She really is despicable.  Eat her.  Marcos and Yockers.  Hey, how's it going?  I think if you work for CNN, you've got to be a bore.  Except for Anderson Cooper.  They should just give him the entire fucking network.  Yep.  Besides him, they're all fucking boring.  He's just hot.  Yeah, I was going to say, you guys have to watch this interview.  He asked her some questions that you can tell that she was pissed off.  Well, Nancy...  Oh, sorry.  Yeah, I'm sorry to cut you off.  No, I cut you off. 
[00:51:30]  He asked her, one of the jurors was asked, what do they think about Nancy Grace?  And she was like, I'd rather not say anything because I'm going to say something that I can't say on the TV.  So that gives you an explanation of what she wanted to say.  Nancy Grace is just a fucking repulsive, ugly woman who is trying so...  I don't care if she's a former prosecutor.  Fuck her.  She's just trying so hard to be that toughest nails gal. 
[00:52:00]  I love it.  That tut mom.  Tut mom.  You fucking...  That fucking baby body was great for ratings.  Oh, yeah.  She loved it.  Your advertising is now more valuable because of that fucking baby's body, you zilch.  She knows it.  No, and I wanted to say that lady had a hard-on for the tut mom.  And to be honest with you, that whole thing, I think it was just an accident and Casey did not want to go to jail.  That's the bottom line.  Casey, whatever.  You know what?  She had a hard-on for the tut mom because it was great for her show and ratings, like Jimmy said. 
[00:52:30]  And let me tell you something else about this Nancy Grace.  She's probably the happiest person in America that this fucking broad was found not guilty.  Think about it.  Think about it.  Well, if she was guilty...  If she was guilty, the story goes away quickly and no more Nancy Grace yelling and screaming about it.  Now tot mom gets out on the 17th and now they're going to track her tot mom.  What's tot mom doing? 
[00:53:00]  Right.  A guy like Rush Limbaugh, happy as a pig in shit that Obama is the president.  Trust me.  Yeah, yeah.  And secretly wants Obama to have a second term.  It's good for business.  Much good.  Much better.  Yeah.  He wants Obama to stay in office.  I'm telling you this.  And Nancy Grace, the same shit.  She wanted this broad to be found not guilty.  It's great for Nancy Grace.  What a disaster.  She has got to hate Nancy Grace.  Yes, sir.  I just wanted to say, I got the peanut butter in the refrigerator, Joe.  Unlike other people. 
[00:53:30]  Oh, they got it.  Some people like their peanut butter in cupboards.  What can I tell you?  I have the natural shit where you have to put it in a fucking refrigerator.  I always refrigerate my peanut butter.  Always.  Thank you, Jimmy.  You have to.  Thanks, Marcos.  I appreciate what you do.  She's just a hateable woman.  Yeah.  Like, Nancy Grace is just a fucking hateable woman.  Tot.  The fact that you would.  She tried to make a catchphrase.  Because what she's doing is you're marrying yourself to this baby car.  Why don't you just fucking take the bones, take the kid's bones with the duct tape and 
[00:54:00]  throw them on the desk and talk over them so people can associate you with the case more.  Right.  Why don't you do that?  Tot, mom.  You're talking like you're an ex-prosecutor talking like a fucking, a corny little bottom  right-hand corner tabloid news story.  You fucking repulsive ugly woman.  Tot, mom.  You unfuckable fat-legged ugly woman.  And you're coming up with catchphrases like a shock jock.  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's exactly what she's doing.  You're an ex-prosecutor.  Yeah.  For God's sakes. 
[00:54:30]  You can't be doing that brother man, brother man shit.  No.  Tot, mom.  Tot, mom.  Isn't every mother a tot mom?  Yeah.  But she wanted that to catch on.  She wanted all the papers to say tot mom and thing and no one cared.  Tracy was queer slur.  I mean, she just has a name for everybody.  Sometimes the simple things really get me.  Kevin from Connecticut just writes, Nancy Grace, I hate him.  Ah.  Exactly.  There's a big article on her.  She has an onion body.  I didn't realize that her bottom half is rough. 
[00:55:00]  She's an unfuckable rotten monster.  I didn't realize though.  A disaster.  Her fucking face and head, she looks like the thing that was trying to do Bugs Bunny's hair.  She looks like, well, he was trying to do Bugs Bunny's hair, that giant monster.  Yeah, the monster.  That's what she looks like.  Such interesting people.  Yeah.  That was it.  She's a fucking, a horror show.  Big fat, awful legs.  Oh, look at her.  Let me see her face again.  Oh.  That fucking man hairdo.  She should be singing Hot Legs. 
[00:55:30]  Who the fuck?  She looks like one of the Bay City Rollers.  Who the fuck is fucking that?  Oh, she sucks with her leather jacket.  Trying to look like fucking leather Tuscadero.  Oh, I hope she gets fucking cancer in her cheekbone.  I really do.  I hope she gets fucking cancer in her cheekbone.  I hope she gets what Roger Ebert has.  Oh, wow.  I really do.  By tomorrow.  That means you're going to cry.  No, I won't.  Unless Oprah asked her, what was the last thing you did with your fucking almost mullet?  What was the last thing you did with your 1970s fucking pop star hairdo? 
[00:56:00]  Tot mom!  Hey!  You married yourself to the baby cadaver.  Congratulations.  Good job.  It's all about you.  Good girl.  Get the ratings.  Nancy Grace.  She's fucking repulsive.  A repulsive, tabloid, fucking, just a giant, ugly woman.  Can I ask Jimmy about something?  Sure.  Well, Joe's going to do it, and then I'm sure you'll have knowledge on this.  Joe in California, go ahead, sir.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  You guys were talking about the word bag and stuff like that.  Jimmy, next time you play Obsessed, well, next time you do your show Obsessed, we've  played Black Sabbath, Fairies Were Boots.  It comes up on my XM screen as Jack the Stripper.  I've heard about this before.  That's also a legitimate title for it.  Was that in parentheses?  Yeah, that's together on the album cover.  I don't know why it does that.  Part of it might be called Jack the Stripper.  I would actually be interested to know that, but I'll play Fairies with Boots. 
[00:57:00]  Sure, I love that tune.  Gossamer!  Yeah.  I thought I got one.  Yeah, that was dope.  That's the monster.  Yeah, I don't know, sir, why that is.  I hope they're not being PC with that.  Although, I don't think so, because Fairies Wear Boots.  Fairies is spelled F-A-R-I-E-S, I think, which is a...  Like, you know, a little fairy, pixie fairy.  I think, dude.  How does it spell fairies?  Oh, my God.  Can we hear Fairies Wear Boots now? 
[00:57:30]  Am I wrong, Sammy?  Give me a little taste of that shit.  The Jack the Stripper is probably fairies.  The long intro.  Even the intro is great.  I haven't heard this song quite a while, actually.  Want to go to break with this?  Yes, I do.  Fuck it.  Do you want to go to the podcast? 
[00:58:00]  I don't know.  I don't know.  Let's go.  We'll be right back. 
[00:58:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:59:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:59:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:00:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:00:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:01:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:01:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:02:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:02:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:03:00]  We'll be right back. 
[01:03:30]  We'll be right back. 
[01:04:00]  The nice thing about big fat fags is they're more specialised.  You don't just find them lying about wherever, but you go to a special shop and they're all  there.  They all sort of hang out and all.  Kind of a fag shop.  Right, there's like, right, there's like on display and you go through and you go through and you look and you smell and you taste and you see which fag you want.  Which fag is for you.  Which fits you nice, you know, right in your mouth in a big way. 
[01:04:30]  Right.  Or a smaller fag that might just slip around in your mouth.  You feel nice, right, right, right, right, right.  Right, right, right.  Anyways, wonderful, Bob, again, this has been a tremendous and very educational program.  And that box of fags is for you.  Oh, no, I couldn't accept it.  Oh, look at those beautiful fags.  We'll all share them after the show.  Thank you so much, Bob, for being here.  and join us again next time  here on FagCop.  Series XM.  The Fire.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  I want to thank Roland  for blowing the last season  of Rescue Me.  That was hilarious.  He blew it.  Should I start watching the end?  I'm looking at it  like I kind of want to see it.  I liked Rescue Me a lot.  But do I have to watch  the beginning?  I don't know.  I've never seen them.  Well, I mean,  I tapped out.  I think I'm about a season  and a half behind right now.  But I really did like the series. 
[01:05:30]  This was hilarious.  Opie gives his idea  of what the finale might be.  Not knowing at all  what the finale is,  but he goes,  I think this will happen.  And then Roland goes,  no, no, what happens is  and then tells him  the whole thing.  Tells him the whole ending.  But the reason he said that  was because I said  I threw the Rescue Me box set  that they gave us yesterday  in the garbage.  We have the final season,  all nine episodes.  Do you really?  Yeah, he edited it out yesterday. 
[01:06:00]  I didn't get that.  Or didn't he?  He sent that to your apartment.  Wasn't that the one  he sent to your apartment?  Oh, I have that,  but I thought it was  only a couple episodes.  No, it's the whole fucking season.  Oh, I didn't realize.  I do have that.  I could watch the whole season  this weekend.  Oh, I didn't realize that.  But I was kidding, obviously.  But Roland thought  I wasn't kidding,  so then he gives me  the synopsis of what happens  and how the fucking series ends.  And we're both sitting here like,  oh, great, thanks.  You know too?  Now I do.  We all know.  I don't know.  Like, fuck.  Let me just ask you this. 
[01:06:30]  As a guy who knows the characters,  is it what you thought  would happen or no?  No.  I mean, I thought  the other thing was going to happen.  I thought it was very obvious  that the other thing would happen.  Okay.  Maybe it was too obvious.  He was talking about one thing.  But yeah.  And then Roland goes,  no, no.  I knew something like that  would happen.  He goes, this happens.  And you're like,  oh, great, thanks.  You know what I do want to see, though?  Mars, what was that thing  that you saw  which I think is really good?  Oh, yeah.  Mars actually wants to go  see something pretty cool  which I've seen too.  What do you want to see, Mars? 
[01:07:00]  Tonight I'm going to see  the production of Sarkana  which is made by  Cirque du Soleil.  What?  How the fuck do you say that?  Say it again.  It's the last part  you're going to ask me.  Say it again.  Cirque du Soleil.  Cirque du Soleil?  Isn't it French?  Cirque du Soleil.  It is French.  It's Cirque du Soleil.  Say that again.  Cirque du Soleil.  Oh, it's fucking...  You should be saying that  with fuzzy dice  hanging from the mirror.  Is English your second language? 
[01:07:30]  He can't even speak Spanish well.  He doesn't speak Spanish well,  does he?  No, he doesn't.  That's not true.  That was an Italian lady accent.  You speak dirty Spanish.  That's not...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That wasn't Spanish.  It was an Italian lady.  Very dirty shit.  I meet the balls.  So how do you say it?  He was boring.  Please.  You're saying it correctly.  Cirque du Soleil.  Cirque du Soleil.  Not Soleil.  You're pronouncing it literally.  Yeah, say it again now.  Cirque du Soleil.  Yes.  There you go.  Perfect.  You're saying...  Now you got it.  Soleil.  But you're forcing a little bit. 
[01:08:00]  Let it flow off the tongue.  Go ahead.  Jimmy, tell him again.  Cirque du Soleil.  Not Soleil.  But don't exaggerate the Soleil like Jimmy is.  He's just doing it so you got the word.  I'm doing it so you understand it.  Cirque du Soleil.  All right, go ahead.  I am going to Cirque du Soleil.  Better.  Perfect.  Not perfect.  Better.  Work on it.  Work on it.  All 300.  Infantry.  Work on it.  My God, man.  So Casey Anthony looked pretty hot in the courtroom yesterday. 
[01:08:30]  Well, they're all picking up on that in the papers today saying, wow, look at that makeover.  Yeah.  She definitely wasn't the same Casey we had seen during the trial.  Why couldn't she just look all beat up?  She got her hair down.  I know.  Well, because she was...  Why do they do that?  Well, she was done.  She was found.  What her lawyer should be like, let's downplay this a little bit.  Oh, they don't give a shit.  They just don't, right?  No, they knew she was probably going to get the max on whatever charges she had anyway.  So go in there and... 
[01:09:00]  But in one day, she looks completely different with her hair down.  The makeup is completely different.  The shirt is different.  Oh, yeah.  She was wearing a little V-neck number.  Yeah.  Hinting that the boobies are right below this.  Oh, they are.  She got a nice set on her right there.  But, yeah, she had her long hair down and smiling.  I saw a black broad yesterday.  Her tits were as big as my fucking head.  Big as your fucking head.  What do you do with those?  Juggle them. 
[01:09:30]  Suck them.  Play with them.  Flap them around while the hurdy-gurdy plays.  What's the hurdy-gurdy?  I don't know.  Yeah, she's apparently getting out on the 17th.  Yes.  It was the 13th, and then they recalculated some shit.  And with her time served and good time and all that crap, she's getting out on the 17th.  Wow, that's pissing off a lot of people, huh?  So it's pretty much, you know, she's done. 
[01:10:00]  No surprises here.  No, not.  I was surprised.  I didn't realize that she had the most time served.  No fucking surprises here.  I said it yesterday, I don't want to ever depend on the judicial system, ever.  Unless you're her.  Fucking ever.  That's good.  Get out.  That seemed to work for her.  I don't plan on doing anything horrific, where then I'm hoping that the judicial system  is so awful that I get away with it.  I love the people that are saying, kill the jury, and people carrying signs, we're here  for you, Kaylee.  Those people are just as kooky. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Kaylee's dead.  Like, kooky people, they have pictures of her, we'll always remember you, you didn't  know her.  Why are they saying kill the jury?  Once again...  Because they have no clue how a trial works.  Right, we're all in agreement on this show, the jury did what they were supposed to do.  Absolutely.  The case wasn't proven, unfortunately.  No, they even said they would have loved to have convicted her.  They believe she's guilty.  The juror sounded pretty intelligent yesterday, the little audio we had, right?  Yeah.  Like, the post-abortion of Kaylee is dead wrong. 
[01:11:00]  Plenty of evidence.  No guts jury.  They had a lot of guts to do what they did.  Yeah.  Hate to say it.  Plenty of evidence.  There really wasn't.  It's like, emotionally, you agree with that sign.  Yeah.  Right.  But the reality is, if you convict her in a court, she is probably guilty, we think  she is, but you just can't do that.  It's one of those things where that's the price we pay for being in a free society, is  once in a while, innocent people, it happens, it sucks, but it happens, but literally, I would 
[01:11:30]  rather have that happen than these people they're releasing, because for 20 years they've  been in jail because DNA wasn't available.  You want to fix the legal system?  Tell them, everyone convicted of rape who really is protesting their innocence for  real, just give them a quick DNA test.  Yeah.  Just get it over with.  Mm-hmm.  I don't mind my tax dollars being spent on that shit.  Yeah.  They had to wait three years sometimes to get a fucking DNA test.  They didn't do it.  Yeah, they're guilty of something, though.  Right here?  Yeah, of course.  Juror 1 through 12, guilty of murder. 
[01:12:00]  But they're really not, ugly lady?  With Jesus on her?  Are they really?  Yeah.  That lady's more insane than anyone right there.  She has a Kaylee shirt.  They're crazy people.  If that kid wasn't dead, you'd just be creepy.  Yeah, yeah.  She has a Kaylee shirt on?  Yes.  Yeah, and she's preaching.  Yeah.  Juror 1 through 12, guilty of murder.  They're not.  The mother wasn't even, apparently.  No.  I'd love to argue with that lady.  Yeah.  Thank God.  I bet your breath smells.  Oh.  Thank God we get to yell and scream about this shit every day.  I would go nuts. 
[01:12:30]  Dude.  Because this is fun.  That's a whack job right there with that sign.  The people with the signs, all I saw were people with signs were crazy people with signs.  They're absolutely crazy.  Yes.  Lunatic people with signs that don't get, either don't understand how the jury works, how the  legal system works, or don't care, and based it all on emotion.  Right.  Some of the dummies from fucking Headline News Network, there's that one that looks like  LaToya Jackson.  What's her name?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you see her?  Yeah. 
[01:13:00]  She's always coming back serious, looking right into the camera.  She was going on a tirade, a tirade, about the fact that one guy was saying, look, the  jury didn't see all the press.  They didn't see the sensationalism.  They didn't see the people yelling and screaming.  And she had to defend the press.  She's like, hey, wait.  All we were doing is giving our opinions back and forth.  It's like, opinions?  Yeah.  That girl hung and fucking getting, you know, the death penalty on day one of the trial. 
[01:13:30]  And, yeah, the jury didn't see that.  And all the guy was saying is, the jury didn't see the news.  And what these people saw was you people editorializing.  And, of course, these dummies that watch it are going to be like, well, what I saw,  she looked guilty.  Yeah.  Because you saw the news.  The jurors were locked in a fucking room.  They heard testimony, period.  That's it.  They heard every word.  Yeah.  That's it. 
[01:14:00]  Jane Velez Mitchell.  That was really funny.  Oh, is she just annoying?  She's another go-getter.  Look out.  Tough as nails, gal.  Tough as nails.  Look out.  Here I come.  I'm going to take you to task.  Yes.  Look out.  She's angry and coming through.  Hyphenates her name.  Make up your mind, bitch.  Are you fucking married?  Are you not married?  Bonnie doesn't fucking hyphenate.  Oh, please.  She doesn't Bonnie McFarlane mistake. 
[01:14:30]  Just drop the whole name.  You can't be tough as nails and wear heels.  Yeah.  It's kind of hard.  Right?  She wears those legal pants suit things.  With Hillary Clinton clothes.  With a little sexiness showing, as you can see in that photo.  Just a little sexiness there.  Enough to say I'm a woman.  She looks like Perez Hilton in the face.  Oh, God.  Fucking mope.  But she always comes back from break, and she's like leaning on one arm, and she's looking  right at the camera.  She's like, we're going to be talking about this. 
[01:15:00]  How are you?  That whole channel's just full of dolts.  What's that?  CNN?  Headline News.  And they got a guy there that's like, at the end of everything, they play some Kaylee montage.  And then he goes, and remember, to hug your children.  Ugh.  Yay.  Dramatic shit.  He's right.  Oh, no, Uncle Paul.  He didn't mean like that.  Give him a hug.  No.  Give me Zanny the nanny.  You think there are a lot more children behaving today? 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, right.  That guy.  Yeah.  Vinnie Paulitan.  He was the one that used this entire debacle to get Twitter followers.  Oh, really?  He kept saying, and follow me on Twitter for all the breaking news.  And when this goes to deliberations, I'll be the one sending out the messages, so follow  me on Twitter.  Can I tell you something?  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with that.  Yeah.  But the fact is, we have to point out that this is good for their business. 
[01:16:00]  Yes.  But they don't want to acknowledge that part of it.  They want to downplay that.  Yeah.  Like, they're doing good here.  No.  They look at this as an opportunity to get a lot of Twitter followers.  Yep.  This guy has a great point on Nancy Grace right here.  Don in Texas.  Don.  Hi, O.  Okay.  What disgusted me was Nancy yesterday, or whatever the hell it was, she gets that solemn voice,  you know, she's all depressed, and she's like, you know, Tot Mom, which I can't stand, is  going to make millions of dollars off this. 
[01:16:30]  But yet, hasn't Nancy Grace been doing the same fucking thing for the last three years  by hype in this case?  You're absolutely correct there, Don.  What's going to end up happening in the end, first of all, it is good for her business.  Her ratings went up like Anthony pointed out, which means her bosses are probably going to  give her a little bonus.  She probably has a bonus plan, or certainly when she renegotiates, she's going to make  money now.  More money.  Hey, you see what I did with that Tot Mom thing?  And let's take it a little further.  I wouldn't be surprised if Nancy Grace has her own book on the whole fucking thing. 
[01:17:00]  And she'll get to keep every single fucking dollar of that.  God, is she fucking awful.  So, this was great for business for Nancy Grace as well.  Tot Mom's former roommate.  Speaks with me exclusively.  Oh, God.  If you hear the guy that Dan was just talking about and Nancy Grace, they were talking about  their mounds of notes.  And I'm sitting there thinking, yeah, that's a script for a TV movie or their next book. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  All their notes that they took is going to be a book.  I think Nancy Grace will have a book come out about this.  And she's not going to throw the money to a charity or anything.  No.  She'll pocket every cent.  Of course.  I am disappointed, Ant, because I did want to see those big, huge, juicy boobs bouncing  around at Live at the Compound.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I don't see that happening.  I don't know if I could hit a...  I don't know about that, Ant.  You got to let this calm down a little bit. 
[01:18:00]  Well, anything could happen.  They all come our way eventually.  You know that.  Oh, yeah.  We finally could have Amy Fisher on our show.  Remember that.  Yes, that's true.  We've been trying to book her for 15 fucking years.  That's true.  We can have her in tomorrow.  Anything can happen.  Eventually, they all come our way.  Old Tot Mom.  Just give it some time.  I want Tot Mom now, though.  I don't want Old Tot Mom.  What do you think?  I wanted the Tiffany they brought in here, the day they brought Tiffany in here.  We had to make believe they were still hot.  The old Tiffany.  I was disgusted with myself. 
[01:18:30]  Debbie Gibson wasn't bad.  I was disgusted, though.  We had to flirt with those two.  Deborah Gibson wasn't bad.  She was horrendous.  No, I don't think so.  She was horrible.  She was all right.  That Tiffany, though.  She was dried out.  Dried out.  That's the one thing about older women.  They just start drying out.  What's that about?  You need some of the KY?  I don't know.  No, I'm not.  Or they just dry out all over the place.  All over.  I'm talking about an overall thing.  Yeah.  You see a dryness to them.  It's just a dry. 
[01:19:00]  They need more lotion.  I don't know what it is.  Are they lotioning enough?  They're always rubbing that goddamn lotion into them women.  It doesn't seem to work as well as it should.  Can I say, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  I never at-mention, I very rarely at-mention people, as far as celebrities when I attack.  I just don't, because it's like I don't need her to acknowledge it, but I'm fucking,  I just can't stop attacking Nancy Grace.  Yeah.  My hatred for this fucking capitalizing pig- 
[01:19:30]  That's what she's doing.  Yeah.  Is fucking, I can't even express how much I dislike this woman.  That's what Nancy Grace is doing.  Not for reporting it or talking about it, but Tot Mom?  Yeah, she tried to make it her own.  She made it her own.  Yeah.  And she killed with that fucking voice.  God, that fucking voice of hers.  Oh!  Is it annoying?  Mm-hmm.  That mullet.  Ugh.  She's got her arms crossed.  She's looking over her shoulder like, hmm, right? 
[01:20:00]  Fuck with me.  Put you in your place.  Or was she a prosecutor or some shit?  I don't care.  Who gives a turkey?  No nonsense.  Excuse my language.  Like the no-nonsense prosecutor.  That's what she was.  All right, well.  So she'll be out, what, in a week?  A little over a weekend?  17th.  That's a Sunday.  17th, she's a-  So they want to downplay it on a Sunday while everyone's at the beach or at the park or something. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, they said they recalculated and figured, oh, she needs a few more days.  Yeah.  But we'll see.  What do you think happens to her?  Where does she go?  Well, she does have a place here in New York.  We know that.  To go.  But people are speculating maybe even L.A.  But I don't think she'd do it that fast.  I think she's just going to settle down for a while somewhere.  Find somewhere out of the way.  Kind of let things blow over. 
[01:21:00]  Maybe head to Europe for a little while.  What do you think the end game is with her?  She fucks up again?  No, I think a book.  Maybe some kind of fucking reality show.  Who the hell knows?  You know?  Yeah, she's got to get herself.  She'll fuck up.  Back in her fighting shape.  What, have another kid and kill it?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know if it'll be that bad.  She is a compulsive liar.  She should look at O.J.  O.J. eventually couldn't help himself and he fucked up.  She'll fuck up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's a liar, so she's going to be fucking up by lying. 
[01:21:30]  So let's see what happens there.  All right.  God, I love this perv switch shit.  Oh, yeah, that was a good one.  This wrestling coach, legendary mass wrestling coach indicted on child porn chargers.  I don't love that part about this, to be honest with you.  I know.  But the perv, I like this part.  He was sneaking into the girls' locker room at the high school.  I kind of like that.  He was a coach, coaching everybody how to wrestle. 
[01:22:00]  He had to make sure there was nothing on the floor that might injure some of the girls.  You got to take pictures so the wrestling moves are good.  I would always get him to wrestle around.  And then all of a sudden the milk would take effect.  Oh, God.  Everybody gets tired.  Oh, wait a minute.  Were you slipping them a mickey?  No, it was to help him wrestle.  Oh.  Get in there, show him how to put the moves on.  You got to put your fingers right there.  You're a disgusting man.  I'm trying to help him wrestle. 
[01:22:30]  Don't you understand any man that coaches girls wrestling probably wants to fuck them?  I would think, you know something, Uncle Paul, that I agree with.  Why would you do that with your time?  Because, yeah, if you're willing to just sacrifice your time to, I think, to teach kids anything, there's an issue.  Well, especially, what man wants to teach girls wrestling?  Yeah.  Wow.  Boys wrestling is a little different.  But what guy wants to look at a bunch of fucking 10-year-old girls wrestling? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  Hey!  The positions they get in as they're wrestling.  Oh, wow.  This guy must have loved going to work.  His switch went off.  He must have loved it.  Every day.  And I love these stories because then I get to talk about the gym teacher at my high school.  Oh, yeah.  That used to have her office.  I will say this every time.  You can say it along with me.  I don't care.  It's too good.  And it has to be said a million times, her office was in the girls' locker room. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  In a big glass booth.  She loved it.  And she was, I didn't know at the time because I had no knowledge, but I know now she had  to have been a lesbian.  Lesbo.  A lot of female gym teachers, you know.  All female gym teachers.  Without exception.  I'm saying across the board, all female gym teachers are 100% lesbian.  Right.  That's got to be the greatest job ever.  You're a lesbian and your office is in the high school locker room. 
[01:24:00]  A room where high school girls take their clothes off.  Right in front of you as you make them believe you're ordering more kickballs or whatever you  do.  Yeah, you're on the phone.  Yeah, we need a few more of those.  Some softballs.  How are we doing on the, uh, that stupid field hockey sticks?  Eh, we need any of those?  Eh, she's just doing nothing.  She's doodling.  Doodling firm tits on her fucking legal pad.  She just has to look up.  Because these innocent girls, they don't know what any of this shit is about yet. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Just innocently getting undressed.  You're developing quite nicely.  Right.  Asking inappropriate questions.  David Castricone.  A legendary high school wrestling coach in Massachusetts was indicted on child porn charges  on Wednesday.  Former champion high school wrestling coach in Massachusetts was a closet child porn fiend.  Only on the clock.  This fucking guy had a hell of a record as a coach, though.  Jesus.  Yeah.  681 wins, 142 losses. 
[01:25:00]  The losers had to fuck him.  That's why they fought so hard.  If you get pinned, he gets to fuck you in the butt.  Two state titles.  Guy did all right.  He's 60.  State's winningest high school wrestling coach.  Indicted on two counts of possession of child porn by a grand jury.  Oops.  The former North Andover high school coach was arrested on February 14th after a student  spotted him lurking in the girls' locker room.  Lurking isn't good. 
[01:25:30]  You could be in there doing something.  Legit.  Yeah, making sure there's enough towels for the girls.  Yeah, or, you know, maybe a locker door was broken and you had to fix it.  Right.  Wouldn't you just be in that locker room on off hours breaking shit?  Oh, of course.  And then the little 16-year-old comes to you, Mr. Mr. Castricone, my locker needs fixing.  My locker needs fixing.  Well, I'll be right in to do it.  But then you're not lurking.  True. 
[01:26:00]  Lurking, you just picture him like slowly peeking around a corner.  He's lurking.  Don't you have the lurking sound effect, though?  Yeah, I think there is a lurk.  They're saying lurking, which means he got sloppy.  He got sloppy.  Yes.  School officials who review the locker security footage.  That's why he was lurking.  How was there security footage?  He was trying to get around the cameras.  Oh, so they got cameras finally in the locker rooms, huh? 
[01:26:30]  Like the Great Escape.  He's hugging the wall, waiting for the searchlight to pass.  It's a video game.  Yeah, they confirmed it was the coach when they looked at the films or the footage, whatever.  My God.  And a review of old footage caught the dirty old man creeping through the locker room at least nine times that month.  Nine times.  And then they went to his house and found the kiddie porn.  Oh, well.  I want to know more about him lurking in the locker room. 
[01:27:00]  In the locker room there.  They don't have details.  I guess this paper doesn't want ratings.  And what was he doing?  Just kind of peering at the girls?  Or they don't even know?  They don't have any details.  I want to know.  That went from a hot story to who gets a fuck?  To like petered out.  Yeah.  Petered out on us.  What the fuck is this?  What's wrong with this woman? 
[01:27:30]  What's wrong with her?  Is she pretty?  No, she was in a rolling chair.  Rolling herself with a cane.  Backwards.  Like an oar.  Backwards past our studio.  It's too early for that shit.  She's a member of the Harvard rowing team practicing.  Oh, it's antisocial.  Oh, the social network.  Oh, yes.  I didn't mean to do that.  Oh, boy. 
[01:28:00]  I have a new hero, by the way.  Who's that?  Well, I don't want to.  We don't know what this.  What?  Well, no.  We're done talking about the pervert.  I just wanted to say this.  I'll forget.  Oh, no.  We're done.  There's no more details, unfortunately.  Yeah, unfortunately.  I wish there was more.  I never paid attention to it.  But my new favorite person, and he's obnoxious, is fucking Chael Sonnen.  Who?  He is a shit-talking, for real UFC fighter.  He's the one in Anderson Silva's documentary, who Silva did beat in the fifth round that 
[01:28:30]  we talked about.  Oh.  I watched a 20-minute interview with him last night.  I don't even agree with him.  I like Silva.  He brutalizes everybody.  Really?  I just wanted to say, we have to get him in this studio.  He badmouths like the other guys?  He fucking trashes Brazil and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.  He was saying how dumb these fucking guys...  Oh, yeah.  Should we go through the tape and get a couple...  There's one part where he's talking about how dumb the fucking, I think, the Noguera brothers 
[01:29:00]  are, that they saw a bus, and one of them tried to feed it a carrot, and the other one  petted it.  He fucking had me howling last night.  All right.  That's funny.  He's like, Fedor sucks.  Anderson Silva sucks.  He's a fucking crazy fucking white boy.  A crazy white boy.  Doesn't care.  No.  That's all I wanted to say.  I just wanted to mention it.  I'm asleep on Chael Sonnen.  He was out of fighting for a year.  I just want to hear a little bit of him. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  What is it?  Like a 230 clip?  This was a 20-minute clip.  I don't know if this is any good.  Yeah, we'll just see what he says.  Most unpopular fighter in this company.  There's this dirt...  Oh, it must be a montage.  Oh, what?  Anderson Silva is easily the most unpopular fighter in this company.  There's this dirtbag named Anderson Silva.  When Anderson Silva walks into a room, you could hear a rat piss on cotton.  I don't want to fight Anderson.  I want to beat him down.  I want to destroy Anderson.  He's got what I want, and envy keeps me up at night. 
[01:30:00]  Can we just be fair and say that?  He's got 12 pounds of gold, and I want it.  That's the difference with me and Nate.  He really wants to get that fight.  Go fight him.  But when you're done playing around, they'll call me.  People tell me he's a great fighter.  I say, really?  When did you see him fight?  Because I haven't seen him fight.  A lot of that moving, or what you refer to as clowning, is what he uses for a setup.  He can go dance and be the Michael Jackson of MMA like he likes to do.  He's got a black belt under the Noguera brothers. 
[01:30:30]  I think a black belt under the Noguera brothers is saying, I got a free toy at my Happy Meal.  Well, Anderson's a fraud.  He's a liar, and he's a thief.  This guy's not from a bowing culture.  You bow in Brazil, they'll hit you over the head and take your wallet out of your pocket.  He beat up a math teacher.  He beat up a slow and unathletic light heavyweight, a couple of them.  I beat every champion there's ever been except one.  He fought everybody in the world that wasn't named Chael Sonnen.  I stand here on my own free will.  I stand here because I beat every middleweight they got in my way. 
[01:31:00]  Anderson's here because Dana White's making him.  His running is done.  His 15 minutes are famer up.  We don't have to fight.  I issued him in writing.  I sent it over my demands.  He leave the UFC for no less than 12 months.  He issued an apology to the fans.  Simple things.  And he erect a statue in my likeness in his living room.  I want an ad.  You don't accept him.  Who cares how he leaves?  Just go.  He's been threatening to go for a long time. 
[01:31:30]  Nobody cares.  We're ready to see him leave.  He's a nuisance.  He's annoying.  And he doesn't have any fans.  I've heard of you.  Now I thought, I didn't know I'd ever meet you.  But ladies and gentlemen, this is Anderson Silva's fan.  I heard that he had one.  People say, do you want to fight the best Anderson Silva?  I don't care if it's the best Anderson or the worst Anderson.  I'm going to beat either Anderson.  I'm going to put him on his prissy little ass.  I'd light up a big old mouth cannon and I'd walk away laughing.  Who's the better one?  CP.  Your ace. 
[01:32:00]  Your guy.  Ace of hearts.  This isn't a fight that's going to be tit for tat.  This isn't a war.  We're not going to go out and battle each other.  This is going to be a one-sided pounding and I'm swinging the hammer.  Holy shit.  It's hilarious.  Wow.  Sonnen's fucking.  So this is going down?  They already fought.  That was the documentary.  It was about the lead up to that fight.  Because I saw August 7th.  I got excited like they're fighting again or something.  No, they fought last year, I think. 
[01:32:30]  What happened?  Sonnen lost.  Oh, shit.  But he was beating him for five rounds.  I think it was five rounds.  And that's what Dana talked about yesterday.  With a minute and 30 seconds left in the final round, he submitted Sonnen.  Wow.  But apparently Sonnen was really winning the fight.  But then the next fight after that, Silva's kicked Belfort in the face and knocked him out.  Did you see the other knockout that Dana White told us to watch?  I did not, no.  Somebody sent it to my Facebook page.  It's fucking ridiculous. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, is it?  Ridiculous.  No, I didn't.  Oh, was it Chongo?  Check Congo, yeah.  It's ridiculous.  The guy was done and then knocked out the dude.  That's the weird thing about MMA.  Right here, look at this.  It's just, you can be on random side.  You could go far, because it's a...  No, not that far.  But that Congo would be fucking...  I mean, uh...  Watch.  J.L. Sonnen would be great to get in the studio. 
[01:33:30]  Congo.  Just put this on our, uh...  Video game names these people have.  Yeah.  Check.  Big right hand!  Pat Barry looking to finish!  Pat Barry.  Pat Barry beat the shit out of him.  He looks like he's out on his feet.  Wow, knock him down again?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He is beating up Check Congo.  Guy looks like he's so done.  He gets up.  He shook him. 
[01:34:00]  Knocks him out.  Wow.  He was out.  Oh, shit.  How did he win that?  That guy was out before he hit the fucking floor.  And Pat Barry was beating the shit out of him.  What's his name again?  Check Congo.  Check.  Check, yeah.  Check.  I think it's Check.  I beat this guy.  This is great.  Look.  He's like, I'm beating the shit out of this guy.  I won this fight.  Oh, wait a minute.  And the guy somehow gets up and just hits him with the right.  The guy's out before he hits the ground.  And then he pounds him a good four or five times.  But that just doesn't matter. 
[01:34:30]  I think Pat Barry beat Cro Cop, too.  He's a good...  He has the worst name ever.  It's the plainest name.  Pat Barry.  It sounds like a name you make up.  Yeah, yeah.  Sounds like one of the Mondo Topless girls.  Mondo Topless.  Pat Barry.  So, yeah, I just wanted to mention Chael.  I forgot I bought some money here.  Fuck.  That's fine.  I wanted to mention Chael because I watched a 20-minute Ariel Helwani interview yesterday.  He, like, interviews all these guys.  And I just... 
[01:35:00]  It was, like, probably 2 o'clock in the morning.  I just couldn't stop watching.  But he was just shit-talking.  And he's brutal and unapologetic.  And I don't even agree with him.  That is fun.  I love Anderson Silva.  I really do.  I love Fedor.  But it's funny.  Apologize, leave, and build a statue of my likeness in your living room.  Dude, he was trashing all those guys fucking from Japan.  Fedor trashing fucking Miracle Crow Cops saying all their fights were fixed and their shit.  Like, they suck.  They suck.  He's, like, a fucking crazy dude, man.  We gotta get him in.  I would love to have him in. 
[01:35:30]  All right.  We should take a break.  We got...  Yeah.  Rich and Bonnie are here today.  All right.  I love when Bonnie's in.  Bonnie looks very good.  Does she?  Bonnie has nice feet.  I never knew Bonnie had nice feet.  Oh, yeah?  I'm not a foot guy, but...  We'll have to see.  Yeah.  I'll be the judge of that.  Maybe I'll suck her toes.  Oh, Jesus.  Did you ever see in Vice Squad, the old man?  I want to suck your toes.  I want to suck your toes.  Yeah, that guy's badass, huh?  He's a fuck dude. 
[01:36:00]  He is a fucking unapologetic just...  He's the white guy.  You're really...  I want to be him on the train.  Oh, right.  When the guy looked at you and...  Yes.  I feel bad for you in that situation.  Well, it was whatever.  It was...  He didn't say anything to me.  Yeah, well...  Glad he didn't.  I felt bad for me, too.  You know what he meant.  Yes.  How do you say his name?  Chael Sonnen?  I think it's Chael Sonnen.  Yeah, he said Sonnen, so yeah.  Sonnen, okay.  Take the Weg writes,  is a capital shit-talker.  He said once that he wouldn't lay on his back  with a guy on top of him 
[01:36:30]  because he's not gay.  You guys would love him.  Yeah, I think we would, man.  He's a...  Let's get him on, man.  I'd love to...  Well, he just got reinstated.  He'd been out for a year.  What happened to him?  It was one of those weird things  where they take a substance  that's technically not banned  or whatever it was.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  I should probably...  Right.  He's not dumb, though,  because in this interview,  he's talking about somebody else  who goes through that at one point,  but he's very careful how he words it.  Like, he's not a stupid guy.  Okay.  Also, 45 minutes away  from the couch of Zilch's today.  Oh, he had that?  Oh, right.  Hey, why not? 
[01:37:00]  And the chair of honor.  Yes.  The chair of honor.  Is Bobo here?  Because I thought we had an opening.  Oh, God.  So he came in?  No.  I thought he came in.  Bobo was hung up on.  You didn't tell him  that we had an opening today?  There was confusion  in the communication.  I told him to call back  for you to tell him this morning,  but then he put you in a bad mood  because he started  the whole thing off wrong  talking about the tickets.  So then you were in a bad mood  and we couldn't tell him.  We had to fill the seat up.  We just did.  Oh, boy. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, poor Bobo.  Someone's got to talk him down.  Because that's what he was supposed  when he called in this morning.  That's what we were going to tell him.  How weird.  How weird he got fucked again.  Very strange how that happens to me.  Yeah.  Talk him down off that ledge, somebody.  This Day in O&A History.  I love this bit.  Danny came up with a great one today.  Oh, what is it?  Well, let's just play it.  And we'll be back with Rich and Bonnie next.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents  This Day in O&A.  Our favorite moments from this very day 
[01:38:00]  in Opie and Anthony history.  It was on this day back in 2008  that we christened an intern of ours,  English Bob,  and made him speak with a British accent  for the duration of his semester.  Jimmy, that's the pasty kid, by the way.  I like him.  That's Bob.  With the apple cheeks.  Is that your name?  Sweet boy.  I'm Bob.  Hey, Bob.  Hello.  Hello, Bob.  Me name's Bob.  But he's not English.  He just looks English.  I know.  He just looks English.  He does look British.  Hello.  Hello, Bob. 
[01:38:30]  Fucking dry hair,  big ears,  and appley red cheeks.  Do you do an English accent at all?  Uh, I've never tried.  I can try now if you wish.  Can you give it a whirl?  May I have some water?  There you go.  There you go.  Aye.  All right.  Oh, little cockney, aye?  Are you done mopping?  I'm done mopping, yeah.  That's not how you say it.  I'm done.  You know, it doesn't sound good.  I'm done mopping, aye?  I'm done mopping.  I'm finished with me mopping, sir.  There you go. 
[01:39:00]  Sounds like one of those bad people  at the Renaissance Fair.  This has been This Day in O&A.  In O&A.  Our favorite moments from this very day  in Opie and Anthony history.  Sirius XM, the virus, the Opie and Anthony show.  Moving right along.  It's going to be a busy fucking day.  We got the couch of zilchers at 845. 
[01:39:30]  We're going to have fun with that.  We got you all moving over to the couch.  Shut up, Casey Anderson.  Oh, my God.  You actually...  Oh, there we go.  The smartest thing you've said in a while.  Yes.  Did I put...  I did Casey Anderson, but here's the problem.  You guys don't get...  No, there's a lot of problems.  I gave you the ban for the doubt,  and I asked Jimmy, because he knows you very well,  I'm like, is he going for a joke here?  An ironic joke from Rich Voss.  But the problem is, you tweeted only five hours ago  that you found out that Casey Anderson was found not guilty. 
[01:40:00]  Anderson, by the way.  That was the joke.  There was a joke in a joke.  Oh, okay.  What's the joke in the joke?  The joke was that he didn't...  He was pretending he didn't know.  Yeah, that I just found it.  He hadn't been aware.  Didn't know the name.  Yeah.  And didn't know the...  No, no, no.  That part was just a mistake.  Oh, that part he fucked up.  Well, here's the thing.  I looked over, I go, what's the kid's name?  Casey Anthony, right?  And she goes, no, Anderson.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, that didn't happen?  No, that didn't happen.  You never had the last name.  I was asleep, and I get tired of telling him, you know, 
[01:40:30]  how to spell things, and it's not Ben Laden,  it's Ben Laden, you know, this sort of...  Ben Laden.  Yeah, and so I just said Anderson, I guess, half asleep,  and he went with it.  And I didn't really...  I didn't do any research.  Yeah, that's all you got to do, really, is just...  I mean, I knew it was something.  All you had to do was turn on his TV.  I knew it was something, he said.  It's been all over the news now for quite a while.  Yeah, but sometimes, you know what, you just get...  Am I the only person who thinks she's innocent? 
[01:41:00]  Is this...  No, I'm with you.  God.  The whole time you thought she was innocent?  Oh, yeah.  Did you really?  Yeah, I was, you know, I was going there.  I was like, not guilty, please.  So what's she...  Then handed the baby a...  She did.  I don't know.  She has something to do with it, but they didn't prove their case.  Yeah, I didn't say they did.  I didn't say they were wrong.  All I know is I'm sure she'll be headlining improvs.  I have no idea how, why, when, whatever.  But neither did the jury, so I said, fuck it, let her go. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  That's how that shit works.  You cut to like six months from now.  Yeah, hi, Dr. Drew again.  Can you call me back?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think some reality show.  Celebrity rehab or something.  Not next week, but, you know.  Yeah, that was the Dr. Drew joke.  I don't want to kill kids anymore.  Can you help me?  Yeah, her compulsive lying is going to get her in big jam.  That's what they'll do.  They'll put her in a house with like 10 kids, and whatever kid comes out last wins.  Oh, that's a good one.  I like that.  That's a reality show I can watch. 
[01:42:00]  With a pool in the yard.  Yeah, a pool, toasters by the bathtub.  Plastic bags and duct tape.  Yeah.  Just lots of dangerous shit laying around.  Yeah.  Speaking of headlining the improvs, I got a bit of a shitty hello from Mike Birbiglia  the other night at the, but I could be misreading it.  Was there a problem with him in the show or no?  Interesting.  I don't know.  It's hard to figure out.  Me and Roland were sitting there.  He was like, hey, good to see you.  Don't give me the L.A. hello.  But it wasn't really the L.A. hello.  What the fuck are you doing? 
[01:42:30]  It wasn't sincere.  He didn't see him.  I just thought it said headlining improvs.  So I was just wondering if we had an issue with him.  I don't know.  Okay.  I think we were cool with him last time out.  Okay.  I thought so, too.  The listeners always remember if something fucked up.  Okay.  And we had kind of a little.  You and him, right?  Yeah.  I remember that.  Oh, right, right, right.  Okay.  And you didn't really take sides, you guys.  That's what's good about you.  It's like, yeah, wait, didn't Vos go off on Birbiglia?  What's Kevin?  Look at Kevin Mina.  I don't know.  I don't know why, but it makes me laugh.  Kevin Meaney is a boss, and then he puts his feet up on the desk, and he's wearing clown 
[01:43:00]  shoes, and I don't know.  I'm laughing at it.  And he's got his little tie and his little suspenders.  I don't know.  I think it's funny.  He's one of the funniest people alive, if you have it.  Yeah, I think he's one of them now.  I used to beat him up for doing the same fucking bit over and over again, but you get past that,  I think you're right.  He is hilarious.  The We Are the World thing was a great bit, but does he do it now ironically?  Not with the Ops.  Yeah, I think he does.  He's got all the new gay material now.  Yeah.  Is he doing gay stuff? 
[01:43:30]  Try to get in the news.  Yeah.  A lot of people think he's one of the funniest guys.  I think he's historical.  You laugh.  It's just so funny.  He's so funny.  You mean funny like?  Funny like, you know, fall off.  No, he doesn't hide it.  He doesn't call it research.  What have you guys been up to?  Yeah, the bosses.  Kevin Meaney is in our movie.  Actually. 
[01:44:00]  Stop.  We had a big fight the other day.  Why?  Who?  Because on...  Well, whose fault was it?  No, hold on.  Quit touching it.  Oh.  Oh, let me...  Oh, no, no, no, no.  I brought it up.  I'll do it first, and then you.  First of all.  No, no.  You butcher it after.  Let me just tell it the way it was.  We were...  Wait, was it?  Who started the fight?  It was Tuesday.  Tuesday.  No, it was Wednesday, and we were going to go...  We had to go shoot something, you know, for this movie, real quick, and then we went 
[01:44:30]  to the mall after it, so I booked golf at 3.30, 3.30.  You know, I spent a whole day doing this, and then take her to the mall, go with the kid  to the mall, and at 3.30, go play.  I went to the mall.  I got my phone fixed.  It wasn't like that.  So, you know...  A spending spree.  Right.  It's an hour and a million dollars.  Get anything you like.  So...  Get yourself something pretty.  So as we...  Yeah, buy yourself phones.  Oh, shit.  So we're leaving the mall, and as we're driving home, all of a sudden, she doesn't feel well. 
[01:45:00]  What are the odds, you know, that now's my chance to go play golf?  She doesn't feel well.  She's a golf every day, don't you?  So she goes, I felt bad, so...  All I said was that I felt like I was getting...  I had a headache, and I had that kind of achy feeling like I might be coming down with  something.  I wasn't really complaining or trying to...  Were you trying to get out of giving him road head on the way home from the mall?  I always give him road head on the way home, whether my head hurts or not.  That's nice. 
[01:45:30]  We say, Raina, close your eyes.  Jesus.  No, I say, watch.  This is what happens.  Sorry.  This is called marriage.  No, so I said I wasn't feeling well, and he said, well, you can lay down tomorrow.  Tomorrow?  I didn't say tomorrow.  Yes.  You can lay down tomorrow?  Oh, I said, tomorrow I'll watch Raina all day.  Uh-huh.  You take the day, you're really hard to look at.  Yeah, but she felt shitty then, actually. 
[01:46:00]  Not tomorrow.  Was Rich being selfish?  Yeah.  I mean, is there any other Rich Foss?  I don't know.  You're kind of selfish, Rich.  No.  Yeah, you know what?  You kind of are.  No, I'm not selfish when I'm fucking...  Making sandwiches for your golf?  Yeah, I made sandwiches for you guys.  Indeed.  Look, I'm scared to start talking about it because I feel like I will just fucking unload.  Really?  I will just be like, and then another thing.  And it's probably shitty to listen to just a wife talking about how much she hates her husband. 
[01:46:30]  A wife bitching about...  Wait, what do you mean?  What does he do that selfish?  We don't live with him.  You know, I don't need a lot, you know.  You're put up with a lot, Bob.  A kind touch, a loving look.  That's all I'm asking for.  Wow.  You know, it's like if he...  Any time that he's ever brought me a coffee, made me a coffee in the morning, I know that  I have to give him a blowjob later.  You act like you throw him blowjob.  Last time you blew me, you busted my lip by lifting your head. 
[01:47:00]  Okay?  You know, it's not like...  Is that...  I don't get it.  Remember when Raina and you lifted your head, you jumped, we were in the bathroom?  Why was Raina close to the blowjob?  No, no, she was running up there.  She was watching television.  Oh, my God.  And Bonnie said, come up here in eight minutes, no matter what, to fuck up.  My blowjob.  Oh.  Eight minutes.  I like how he tries to pretend he can last eight minutes.  You're right.  I usually try to get it over with in two. 
[01:47:30]  I want to get into the selfish stuff.  Rich is selfish, huh?  Rich is selfish.  Rich will spend hours getting his golf clothes ready.  Like, there's never been a time where he hasn't meticulously ironed and laid out his golf clothes.  He'll even try on several different combinations and be like, does this match?  It's like, it doesn't matter if it matches.  You look like a colossal loser. 
[01:48:00]  I mean, no matter what.  He's like, do these shoes match these card pants I'm wearing?  They have pictures of playing cards on them?  Yes, yes.  You've seen his clothes.  It's what, loud mouth or something?  They're crazy golf clothes.  And he goes, I get compliments on them.  That's because people don't know what to say.  They're like, oh, my God.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, that's great.  Horror.  Well, you look good.  You have to tell him he looks good before he leaves the house?  I don't, but apparently other people don't. 
[01:48:30]  So wait, so like you wanted to just lay down and he wouldn't put his golf game off?  Is that what the problem is?  Well, I canceled.  No, no.  Yeah.  It went into an escalated, huge, huge fight.  How did you start fighting?  Like, you said, like, what the fuck?  I can't lay down?  I said, I can't believe you just said I can lay down tomorrow.  And any time that you bring anything up that might, he feels like he's losing control of  what he wanted to do or I don't know what it is, he will just lose it.  He just starts yelling and goes into, you know, defense mode of like attack and kill. 
[01:49:00]  And that's until it becomes like this huge escalated fight.  Then this is the, this is Rich Voss in every situation.  He does not control his emotions.  He lashes out.  He gets mean, whatever.  Are you fucking crazy?  Yeah.  And then in an hour, an hour and a half, two hours, he will apologize and say that he's  wrong.  And he does it.  I've seen him do it.  Yeah, but I gave you, I usually give you the Tracy Morgan apology. 
[01:49:30]  So I know, so I know I won't get fired.  No, I apologize because I make a tense step.  Sometimes when you're wrong, you probably admit it, but I'm not always wrong.  Yeah.  Promptly.  You sound like probably free.  You know, you admit it.  I don't want to talk about it.  Yeah.  It's like really, it's not even funny anymore.  Yes, it is.  It's just, it's so annoying.  No, we don't fight that much anymore.  We've been good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Are you, are you, I will give him the silent treatment for like, you know, three days and 
[01:50:00]  be like, we've been getting along really good lately.  Oh, so you've just, you've just given up on trying to fight back and fuck it.  Oh, you're funny, man.  Oh, man.  I didn't need me to tell you that, but fuck.  You're funny.  So like a lot of times Rich will, um, do you think that he puts his golf game before  other things?  Oh my God.  If he has to get Raina ready to go to school.  I mean, I'm horrified when I pick her up.  I mean, her hair is not brushed.  She's wearing a stained outfit.  Do you think he would ever go golfing with a stained outfit or his hair not completely gelled 
[01:50:30]  so it cuts your hand?  I mean, why do you have to look so good on a golf course?  Yeah.  What is it?  I have noticed that over the years.  What's that?  Why do you have to look so damn good on a golf course?  I don't like the way you're saying that.  You have to respect the game.  Oh, wow.  You know, it's not, this isn't basketball with a bunch of parolees out there.  You know what I'm talking about?  This is a respectable game where men.  Where white people get out there. 
[01:51:00]  Not white, some Jews.  And women keep their place, you know, maybe Monday morning they could play.  What I'm saying is, it's a respect, you know, you respect the game.  That's all.  So do you look at other people that walk on and just basically have just a basic collared  shirt and jeans or something?  I call them Anthony's.  You can't wear jeans on a golf course.  No jeans on a golf course.  Here at Bushwood.  Some they can wear t-shirts or whatever.  You don't have a collar, you know, you're not respecting the game.  That's all.  But the last time we played golf. 
[01:51:30]  Golf stinks.  You looked like this.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't respect the game.  You're just walking up the grass, hitting a ball, which is fine to do that, but don't  have to get the dress up.  Right, right.  This is how he looked the last time we played.  That's not respecting the game.  That's respecting the Puerto Rican Day parade.  You look like Ronnie Dangerfield, a Jewish Ronnie Dangerfield.  It's so horrible.  What's the name of the company again?  Loudmouth?  Loudmouth.  I told everyone.  Loudmouth.  If you're listening, he doesn't need any new golf clothes.  Stop sending them.  He's got hundreds of them not even open. 
[01:52:00]  I got 15.  15 what?  Loudmouth pairs.  Of what?  Loudmouth pairs.  Of these kind of pairs?  Yeah.  Do you like them, Bonnie?  I don't want to go out with him.  He kind of wants people to notice him on the golf course.  That's what I'm thinking more than respecting the game.  I'm thinking, yeah, you want kind of some recognition out there.  Well, no.  First of all, I'm an entertainer.  Okay.  I understand.  Maybe not your profiler.  Well, that too.  I just went profiling a couple weeks ago. 
[01:52:30]  Anyhow.  So, no, I don't care for people because some days I don't wear it.  Some days, you know.  What?  When you don't want to respect the game?  Yeah.  You either respect the game or you don't.  I still wear respectable clothing.  Oh, okay.  You know.  So, what's the difference between the days where you wear that attire and the days you  don't?  The days I don't are usually the last-minute golf days, so I wasn't mentally getting ready.  You didn't lay out the clothing.  I didn't really make sandwiches for everybody. 
[01:53:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He makes a good sandwich.  Especially when you're hungry.  I hope he's raved about your golf sandwiches.  What was the last one with the flatbread?  That was terrific.  The flatbread, turkey, salami.  That was terrific.  And low-fat Swiss cheese.  That was beautiful.  Yeah.  With a little mustard.  Yeah.  And then he gave me a little granola bar to go with it for a little snack.  It's great.  I feel like I'm bagging my kids' lunch.  Yeah, yeah.  I want to kill him.  You said that you've never made your kids' lunch.  Oh, shit.  I'm sitting here thinking, I have to go golfing with you in order to get a lunch.  He doesn't make you sandwiches? 
[01:53:30]  Sandwiches.  He's never made me a sandwich.  I do, too.  Please.  I do, too.  I want to kill him for it, but when it's 100 degrees out, you're on the eighth hole,  and you're starving, and he opens up his little fucking cooler for you.  It's the greatest thing ever.  Gets you a little lunch out.  Yes.  Yeah, that sounds nice, though.  That's generous, right?  I think my father-in-law was a little creeped out.  He didn't eat your stupid sandwich.  No.  Oh, he gets offended if people don't eat his sandwich.  He comes home, and he's...  My father-in-law's a real man.  Like, he's a man's man.  He ain't eating another guy's sandwich ever. 
[01:54:00]  No.  Ever.  He'd rather starve.  He's one of those guys.  Blue-collar Philly guy.  He ain't eating your sandwich.  He's just not doing it.  He'd rather pass out.  I'll just wait for the ninth and then grab a hot dog.  I spanked that man's man on the course.  Oh, shit.  Both of these.  I taught them.  I schooled these bitches.  Did you school them?  Really?  Yeah.  That's okay.  But you know what?  They don't play like I do.  I walked off yesterday.  Why?  I was too tired. 
[01:54:30]  I think I got Lyme disease.  I'm sore, and I'm always like...  What are we supposed to do with this body?  No, I'm serious.  I think I got Lyme disease.  I'm going to call my doctor.  Are we supposed to go with this and go, are you all right?  I think we should bully him until he kills himself.  Just a suggestion.  Why do you think you have Lyme disease?  It was a horrible day yesterday.  I'm sore.  As far as the humidity goes.  I'm always sore.  You're always in the grass, too.  It's possible.  You're probably in the woods, knocking your balls back out.  No, that was not.  Picking them up and carrying them.  No.  Oh.  But I do. 
[01:55:00]  I'm going to go get checked because I'm sore.  Stop saying sore.  We got it.  I'm run down.  Maybe you have the flu.  Maybe you have herpes.  It's endless.  If it wasn't Lyme disease, it would be something else.  I mean, it's endless with this guy.  No, because I'm not a spring chicken.  You get, you know, you feel things.  No one confused you for a spring chicken is what she was getting at.  But stopped herself because she's trying to be good.  But I picked up on that.  It just was too easy.  It's like, you're 100. 
[01:55:30]  We get it.  He's fucking just had a birthday.  He's now two Viagra old.  One Viagra because of the age and the other Viagra because of the fucking thing.  Snap.  No, she looks kind of good.  I look great.  Don't say I look great.  You know why?  Because you guys have been sweet to me on this show.  But I feel bad for fans when they come up to me and they're like, oh, I could see them  be like, oh.  Why didn't you put an S on fans? 
[01:56:00]  Oh, shit.  Bonnie's going to be a Mugubi.  I love Opie and Anthony fans.  Huh?  Unlike you.  I love the Opie and Anthony fans.  Why doesn't he like the fans?  Because nothing's ever good enough for him.  Does he complain about a lot of things?  I don't see him anymore.  What does he complain about?  I don't know.  Why are you making me into this person?  No, I'm asking.  I don't like the horrible wife.  But you're not.  It's funny.  You're always funny.  But it's like we know Rich.  He's one of my best friends ever.  But there's things you know about him that I don't.  He complains about things that are ridiculous to complain about. 
[01:56:30]  He hates 50s.  So anytime he gets a 50, I have to hear the rant on how much he hates 50s.  $50 bill?  Yes.  Why?  You don't have one, you dummy?  God forbid, you know, he goes 10 seconds without complaining about something.  Why do you hate 50s?  Hold on a minute.  Because they're not 20s or 100s, and they're just fucking ridiculous.  To the point it bothers you, though?  Yeah, I got two in my pocket.  Yeah, I love them.  I hate $2 bills. 
[01:57:00]  That's more reasonable.  That's more reasonable, right?  I pay for a lot of escorts, so fucking 50s are my friend.  Because then if they want $350, the only time I've had to give them $360, we're fucking...  Oh, because you don't have the exact change, I guess.  You can't give them $340.  Yeah.  So yeah, I love a good 50.  They cost that much?  $250, whatever.  Look at him.  Yeah, there's hazard duty pay.  Is this Norton?  Okay.  Now I go back to Bonnie.  So he gets a 50.  Then what happens?  He just breaks down?  Then he'll just go into his I hate 50s rant. 
[01:57:30]  And then...  That makes no sense.  That's a weird one, Rich.  Yeah, that is a weird one.  I know it's fun to beat you up, but that one's a weird one.  And he'll have to pull over and go in somewhere and exchange his 50s.  That happens.  Oh, he's OCD.  He's OCD.  He's obsessive-compulsive.  You have to get two 20s and a 10?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd rather have that any day.  That's more manageable to him for some reason.  50s are overwhelming.  It's hard to add?  I don't understand.  I'm good with math.  You're not good with math. 
[01:58:00]  I am good at math.  Ask her.  You're not.  He always says he's a really good salesman.  Salesman?  Yeah, he likes to brag about certain things.  Oh, my God.  Because he had a painting business for 15 minutes.  And then he's like...  It's a crack and fucked up his business.  Yeah, exactly.  These people, you know, he met a guy who's a landscaper and he immediately was like,  yeah, he had a plant business.  These people are like, we don't fucking care about your dumb selling plants out of a van. 
[01:58:30]  I don't know.  Those are your drug days.  I don't understand.  These two rule.  First of all, do I fix everything around the house?  Are I pretty good at that?  Fixing stuff?  Mm-hmm.  Fixing stuff.  Does he fix stuff as opposed to paying someone to do it?  Oh, no.  He doesn't pay anyone.  He doesn't pay anyone to do it.  I'm not cheap.  You're not saying I'm cheap.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you think I'm cheap?  You really don't think I'm cheap?  You like a good deal, Rich.  You do.  We know that.  You bought a car off eBay. 
[01:59:00]  You're cheap.  I didn't buy it.  I was gonna.  But you're cheap.  You buy rings from people who are grieving.  It is a beautiful ring.  I can't imagine why this marriage isn't working out.  He'll look at a fucking funeral.  There's a great place to get a deal on a wedding ring.  You're a fucking creep.  That doesn't make you cheap.  It just makes you thrifty.  I like.  You like a good deal.  I like.  Yeah, I like.  You like to barter.  I like to barter hunt.  It's fun.  It's because I don't do drugs.  But back in the day.  He one time, I might have told this story before, but when Raina was an itty bitty baby, we went 
[01:59:30]  to some garage sales and he bought one of those rocker things that you put a baby in  on the counter.  And then he saw another one for $2 cheaper at another garage sale.  He took the first one back.  Did you really?  Oh my God.  It was like, he got one for $5, then he saw one for $3.  So it's not just buying two?  No, the other, the second one was better.  It was better. 
[02:00:00]  So I didn't want to, I didn't want to, the other one to go to waste.  I didn't want some other family not to be able to have it.  Oh God.  So he spun out, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I brought it back.  I didn't want it.  Why don't you just give it to someone?  It's not greed.  You don't know how many people have kids.  It's all secondhand to begin with.  It's a little creepy.  Why would you buy a secondhand thing?  You're an entertainer.  Seinfeld's out looking for fucking garage sale things for his baby.  They got bed bugs in them.  What's the matter with you?  I'm sure his account is change either, but I do.  Well, count your change.  Do you count your change in front of people? 
[02:00:30]  When you get your change, you always count it?  King, king, king, king, king.  Oh God.  But then he throws change out the window.  Like he's such a, like he's, like yesterday I came out of 7-Eleven and he was in his Porsche  and I was like, oh, he just looks like such a dick.  He just, it's like this, this picture.  And he just like rolls down his window and throws change out his window.  I guess he thinks it's cool.  I don't know.  He looked like a dick in his Porsche.  Oh, it's like, holy shit. 
[02:01:00]  It annoyed you?  He's like super tan.  Look at him.  He's like, oh, he just looks, and he's got that look on his face.  Like, yeah, you got to see her.  The other day she puts on her one piece, piece.  One piece, forget it.  What, one piece bathing suit?  Yeah.  And I, and I feel like I'm.  He gave up.  He gave up.  Oh, forget it.  Yeah.  Take your bum out.  Forget it.  Yeah, I was wearing a one piece bathing suit, and he's.  Forget it.  And what happened?  I don't know.  He just said I looked funny. 
[02:01:30]  What do you mean funny?  Rich, why would you do that?  Funny how?  It looked like a scene from Goodfellas when they were going to the pool.  Remember?  No.  Goodfellas.  Yeah.  Was it Goodfellas?  Goodfellas.  Yeah, it was Goodfellas.  Yeah, it was Goodfellas.  Whatever.  I'm not going to fight with my wife, because I'm getting along.  We had.  But why did she look funny in her one piece?  Yeah, what do you mean?  What's wrong with you?  I have no, I don't know.  She looks good, so I, you know.  Yeah.  The thing is, the good thing is, she kind of has low self-esteem, so.  Obviously.  That's what I take.  Yeah, that's what people always say.  That's a given.  Why are you with him? 
[02:02:00]  I hate me.  I have to either marry, start cutting myself, or marry you.  We have Tom Papa here.  This is perfect for the married friend.  Oh, wow.  Oh.  Oh.  Wonderful.  Let's walk him in.  Where is he?  Tom Papa.  Where's Tom?  He's down the hall.  Well, they all left the door together.  Hey, what are you guys promoting?  I know I said it, Bonnie's going to be at Magoobies.  Is that how you say that?  Magoobies.  I want people to come and see me for once in my life.  Where are you working?  Without Rich Foss, so I can just unload this albatross. 
[02:02:30]  She's headlining there.  Next weekend?  No, she's there at the 15th, 16th.  Yeah, that's next weekend.  That's next weekend.  Where is it?  It's next Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  No, Friday, Saturday, she's there.  Just Friday, Saturday.  Oh, then your plug is fucked up.  All right, so next Friday and Saturday at Magoobies in Baltimore.  Magoobies.com.  M-A-G-O-O-B-Y-S.com.  And this Friday and Saturday.  Is that a black club?  I'm sorry.  No.  Magoobies?  No.  I do the chicklin' circuit.  I don't even know what that is.  It's the chicklin', not the chicklet circuit. 
[02:03:00]  Chicklet circuit?  Wow, you're working my teeth?  I'm at Uncle Vinny's tonight and tomorrow in Point Pleasant.  Very cool.  Uncle Vinny's in Point Pleasant.  Now I'm going to get Jay Moore to call me yelling at me.  Why are you doing Uncle Vinny's?  Because it's a...  Hi, Tom.  Hi, Tom.  Why will he care?  Who, Jay?  You don't give a fuck.  He does.  Why?  He's upset.  About you doing Uncle Vinny's?  Yeah, no, about me not working, like, different rooms.  Because you work in dumps all the time?  Yeah.  First of all, that's not a dump.  It is!  No, you haven't seen it. 
[02:03:30]  It's a good little room.  It's a good room.  It's a good room.  And it's local.  It's convenient.  I get in my car.  I drive there and drive home tonight.  I don't have to deal with flying to a...  You know?  Tom Pop is blowing kisses to everyone.  Yeah, so we're distracted.  I have no idea what you saw.  Tom looks like he's in pretty good shape.  It really bugs me.  Good morning, everybody.  You're in good shape.  Morning, Tom.  I know.  That's a slimming shirt.  I know it's kind of hacked, but to connect everybody here, these two, marriage ref, you  know, these two are having major fucking problems.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  You know, I don't understand these guys.  First of all, we don't go on the show as contestants.  We go on as celebrities.  Okay?  We're not contestants on shows.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Like, I'm going to go on, ooh, look, and they make fun of it.  And I'm going to have fucking Brewer and him making fun of me.  $25,000, Rich.  What?  How much?  $25.  Exactly.  To win?  That's six months worth of work.  And by the way, no more Uncle Vinny's.  And by the way, what slouches have been on your show that he's saying he's a celebrity 
[02:04:30]  and wouldn't show up?  Well, a lot of times, you know, we have a big board up, like, of all the guests that we  want to try and get.  Yeah.  And a lot of times there's, like, the Rich Voss three-by-five card next to the Ricky Gervais  three-by-five card.  And Seinfeld and, you know, people like that.  And real slouches have shown up.  It wouldn't be so hard to find Rich because you've got to go through everyone's publicist,  and for some reason, it doesn't seem like he has one.  No, I do have a publicist.  She's sitting right there. 
[02:05:00]  That's my manager.  Oh, okay.  Bonnie's wearing some shorts today.  Bonnie looks great.  She just sat up in the chair where her leg is sticking up.  That's why I just know.  Obviously, your sinuses aren't working.  Oh, please.  Oh.  Rich, Jesus.  You're 57.  Bonnie looks good.  Yeah, Bonnie looks really good.  You know, everybody, you know, here's the thing.  Stop chewing your gum on the air, you addicted idiot. 
[02:05:30]  Just quit.  You just quit, fucking Nicorette gum.  You're fucking, you're over it.  You won.  Stop.  Stop being a slave to it.  Siggy's.  Yes, I like trannies.  No, I didn't.  Don't blow them while the show is going on.  Or chew on a substitute.  He falls asleep with his gum in his mouth, and I have to make that hard decision of, you  know, take it out or let him choke. 
[02:06:00]  I just gave up on the gum.  How long have you been chewing the gum?  Five years, I think.  Hold on.  Ref, five years.  Five years on the gum?  Yeah.  You're supposed to do the gum for what?  A couple of weeks, right?  Get rid of it, and that's it.  A month, maybe.  Well, maybe they should put it on the box.  Could be addicting.  There's my lawsuit.  It is addicting.  It's got nicotine in there.  Well, listen, I haven't smoked in five years.  But you're still going to get mouth cancer from the nicotine.  No, you don't get cancer from nicotine.  You get cancer from cancer stuff. 
[02:06:30]  It contains cancer stuff.  And believe me, I washed his face.  He didn't mean to do that.  No.  It started a thought.  It's true.  And he all of a sudden was out on a plank and realizing, oh, no, I'm dumb.  His eyes were literally spinning around.  But he found funny in the process.  He found some funny.  Oh, my God.  Was that great?  Fantastic.  Utter shame.  May contain cancer stuff. 
[02:07:00]  We totally stopped eating cancer stuff.  Yeah.  Bonnie, are you embarrassed when he says stuff like that?  No.  I actually, I like it that people can see.  Like, oh, I feel like people are like, oh, that's what she goes through.  Yeah.  These two are very close to fucking having an all-out brawl today.  Oh.  And we're trying to make it happen.  Last time I saw them, Bonnie was just like, I was like, hey, Bonnie.  She just started plowing into, you've got to save me. 
[02:07:30]  Rich just drives me into the city.  We're stuck in traffic.  He's just listening to right-wing radio.  We're three hours straight.  He doesn't understand any of the issues.  He doesn't really believe it.  But he just keeps yelling out facts that don't make sense.  You've really, help me.  I know.  I get to the city, I'm like, ah.  You really listen to that fucking right-wing radio?  Stop.  It stinks, Rich.  I used to, too.  It's terrible.  I know.  And Bonnie's like, just ask him about any issue and watch how he doesn't understand it. 
[02:08:00]  I was like, Rich, what about Israel?  Well, it contains cancer stuff.  Obama, Obama's pro-Palestinian.  Does he listen to music in the car?  No, never.  Music plays no part of his life.  Dude, you should listen to it.  I started listening to music.  It's more fun, man.  Right-wing radio, it's like, any of those guys, they're just dummies.  But he's scared that he won't have anything to say.  Like, he's got to, he's got to, like, kind of memorize.  Right.  The talking points.  The talking points. 
[02:08:30]  No, first of all.  Do you think he's doing that to just gear up for arguments?  Like, to load up ammunition?  Yes.  As opposed to enjoying it?  Yes.  Yes, absolutely.  It's not like actually educating himself for a greater purpose.  It's so that, if you say something, he can be like, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Why don't you listen to music?  Those guys are all dopes, dude.  I listen to music sometimes.  I make my own CDs.  I used to listen to them for fucking, I can't listen to those guys anymore.  Any of them.  Obamacare stinks.  No.  I don't even care about Obamacare.  Ugh. 
[02:09:00]  Gives a fuck.  And you don't talk about that stuff in your act, really, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, I get some stuff.  Oh, political.  You do some political stuff.  You're getting political.  I haven't watched Rich in a long time, but that's good.  Getting a little political, huh?  He gets like Lenny Bruce, takes out the gum, chews it slowly on stage.  Yeah, yeah.  No.  Obamacare.  Yeah, I said it.  I said it.  After Hannity did.  So what do you, what do you, what do you, well, you have to learn somewhere.  You either read it or you hear it.  No. 
[02:09:30]  Yeah, but that's not a good place to learn it.  Yes.  There's a difference between that and parodying.  No, I don't parody.  No, I make my own, I make my own assumptions.  I, you know.  Which is why it doesn't make sense.  But I just picture them on the New Jersey Turnpike on the way into the city.  You blaring the radio and Bonnie just hanging your head out like a collie.  Yeah.  I don't want it to listen.  He tries to bait me into arguments and I won't.  I'm just sitting, he's just having.  He wants to practice on you.  Yes, he's having a huge argument. 
[02:10:00]  I won't say anything and it'll just go on.  You get it?  You get what I'm saying?  You know, you're like, oh my God.  You think he just wants to be heard?  Rich for once just wants somebody to go.  No, that's a good point.  No, no, I make my own point.  No, no, no, because, look.  Look, first of all, don't sit.  I've tried everything with this guy right here.  This is what happens.  You won't do 69.  This is what happens.  You really won't?  I don't like to work and receive at the same time.  I just want to enjoy it.  It's like having to give a massage while you're getting a massage. 
[02:10:30]  I don't have a good idea.  Good point.  You know what?  She is making really good points here.  It's not a bad point.  I like a good 69, though.  I like a good, yeah, because I like the smell right over my nose.  Put your asshole on my nose.  The balls.  You should get more than one girl, then, in that situation.  This is what Rich does when he, oh, if you guys want to talk about it.  No, no, that's good enough.  I didn't want to take it away from the 69.  Oh, no.  But if you listen to him and then, like, I've tried to give him encouragement. 
[02:11:00]  Like, if I go, that's a really good point, you'll be like, that's a great point.  Like, you can't even win there.  No, it was just good.  First of all, I don't like how you're sitting like you're the girl on the show.  All right?  I'm trying to overpower you.  She's the girl on the show.  She is pointing it right at you.  I know.  And she's proving she's not a hole, so.  She's not a hole.  Yeah.  She's just one of the guys.  So, buddy.  What's an issue that he talks about a lot in the car that will just be like, I'm right 
[02:11:30]  already?  Like, what's one of his pet issues?  Well, the Obama is pro-Palestinian.  Oh, we're getting back to his Jewish thing.  Yeah.  But he's only Jewish politically.  He just likes to belong to a group.  I mean, he doesn't.  Yeah.  He's a joiner.  The tattoo.  He hasn't even told his kid.  Yeah, with the Jew tattoo.  The star of David tattoo.  Doesn't make any sense.  Yeah.  I like the ghetto star of David that he wears around his neck.  That prevents him from being buried with the Jews.  Yeah. 
[02:12:00]  You were going to say something about your kid.  No, his girls one time asked me, what is Judaism?  And I was like, okay.  Like, he doesn't even explain to them about his religion.  Well, they're old enough to fucking read.  You know?  Fucking a fucking waste.  You know?  What is it?  Isn't the whole thing about your kids?  They're your kids.  They're your kids.  It's the most base argument.  Basic shit you've got to explain to them.  All those years of listening to talk radio, you'd think you'd come up with, what's a Jew?  But it would be kind of cool to give him, like, a little Jew test right now. 
[02:12:30]  And just, you know, like, what is Rosh Hashanah?  Oh, let's do this.  Exactly.  What is Rosh Hashanah?  The New Year's.  Can we come up with five basic Jewish questions out there?  Five basic Jewish questions.  That's when you need Rosh Hashanah immediately.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Do Jews believe in heaven?  Oh, good question.  Do Jews believe in heaven? 
[02:13:00]  Mm-hmm.  Stumped.  Yes, they do.  Listen.  Do they?  Yes, yes.  First of all.  Yes.  They do.  Is it the same heaven that Christians go to?  No, there's a deli.  That's kind of funny.  Oh, thank you for fucking...  That's a great point.  That's really funny.  What's their heaven all about?  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, what's Jew heaven all about? 
[02:13:30]  Yeah.  What is it about?  Wait, wait, what was that in Goodfellas?  He died, went to Jew heaven.  Jew heaven, yeah.  When you do what?  I thought he died, went to Jew heaven, yeah.  Getting a little...  I can't remember that.  Not at all.  Sweating it up.  He's patting his forehead.  Ah, Jew heaven, huh?  Can I ask Jeeves?  Kennedy never covered this.  Right.  Wow, wow, wow.  Yahoo answers.  Yeah, what are good Jewish questions? 
[02:14:00]  Can we get some from the people there?  That's a good one from Tom Papa.  I say yes.  What is the Jew heaven all about?  Yes, they believe in heaven.  But what is it?  It's where you go when you die.  What is it?  For you, it should be the green room.  Covered in sweat.  He's redeemed of...  He's got Lyme disease.  What about Jewish questions?  Anybody on there on Paltok have any?  They have to.  Yeah, I'm kind of...  How old is the Jewish calendar just came in? 
[02:14:30]  That's a hard one.  Two years younger than Rich.  You have a star name at that, too.  What about politically?  Because I really don't understand when they keep talking about that they want to go back  to the borders of 1967.  What does that mean?  That means before they took over the occupied territory now.  That was before...  What part of the occupied territory?  Like, why?  Suez Canal...  I'm too tired to do that. 
[02:15:00]  No, no, no.  The Golan Heights, the Golan Heights, and the Suez Canal.  Okay.  Were...  Were...  Were supposedly...  Supposedly?  Supposedly.  There's no V in that word.  Supposedly.  There's no V in that word.  What is the Golan Heights?  You know what I'm saying.  Supposedly, the Golan Heights and the Panama Canal were connected.  If you get on the Suez Canal, you'll get to June Heaven.  I don't know if I came in the studio that it would be attack me day. 
[02:15:30]  No, it's attack me.  We just want to ask Jewish questions.  No, we're just...  I'm just trying...  This is five basic Jewish questions.  This isn't an attack.  We just want to see what you're learning when you're torturing your wife in the car.  Right.  Exactly.  So, what's the...  How about...  What's the Oslo Agreement?  Oh, that's a good one.  What's that?  The Oslo Agreement?  I wanted to stop now.  What's that feel?  No, I want to know.  No, she's kidding.  She's collateral damage.  She really doesn't want to be farther.  What is it? 
[02:16:00]  I don't got that one.  That's, uh...  Who, um...  Who killed, uh...  I think Rabin, right?  Who killed...  Hitzchak Rabin?  Hitzchak Rabin.  Who killed Rabin?  That's a basic Jewish question.  Fucking the gunman.  This gunman.  He was stabbed in the face, Rich.  So, why is Obama wrong with all this? 
[02:16:30]  That's showing gum on the air.  He's nervous.  Let it go this one time.  This is a tribunal.  Jewish question.  Who, uh...  Who, uh...  I'm sorry, Rich.  When Jimmy Carter brought together, who?  The two, the two, uh...  Uh...  Uh, Goldem, Mayer, and, uh...  Oh, you mean the two countries?  Oh, my God.  Egypt and Israel.  No, no, no.  Who were the leaders?  Who was the big handshake between the people?  What leaders of his...  Menachem Begin.  And, uh... 
[02:17:00]  I'm begging you to stop.  Mary Connell Moore.  Now, who's the other one?  You had it for him.  It was, uh...  The one...  What do you call him?  He was shot.  He was killed by his own army.  Yeah.  Listen, I haven't read up in a while.  Oh, my God.  So, I think you should listen to music on your way into the city.  I think you're not learning anything.  You're learning nothing from right-wing radio.  Bonnie, what would you like to listen to on the way in?  I would...  I don't even...  Even if he listened to his, like, 70s, you know... 
[02:17:30]  But if all of a sudden he goes, the radio is yours, what would you put on?  Um, I would probably...  NPR?  Yes, NPR, bro.  NPR sucks, too.  That's terrible radio.  Now we gotta beat up Bonnie.  You know what the thing is about NPR, though, is that they have these, they have, uh, you  know, like, uh, little, like, radio documentary type things.  We're in a war-torn country.  Yes, I like it.  A little boy plays with the top.  And then I also listen to, uh...  Bonds are falling nearby, but the boy continues in his search for water. 
[02:18:00]  That's exactly it.  Rich is right.  Everybody lost my points there.  And we are blows.  What kind of music, if you'd listen to music, what would you listen to?  Me?  Yeah.  Uh, I, I, a lot of times listen to, like, the Princeton stations that they do.  They, they, they, like, you know, they have, like, an eclectic playlist and stuff.  No, stupid, what type of music?  Now, what, what station?  Well, I listen to 98.6.  Well, what do they play that you like?  No, those are, like, 89.2s.  Pinpoint, what type of music? 
[02:18:30]  I like older music.  I like Motown.  I like 70s.  I like, uh, rock and roll.  You know, stuff like that.  He blows it every time.  I blow it every time.  Rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  What's that?  That's a given.  Everyone in this room likes rock and roll.  Some of us don't copy it and play it in fucking bars in Long Island.  But you don't say it like, like, Elvis just showed up.  Right.  Thank you.  The rock and roll.  Rock and roll.  The rock and roll.  That's the Beatles playing as Landon. 
[02:19:00]  We know rock and roll.  Okay.  Have you heard of this new rock and roll game?  The British Invasion.  I know, you know, I can name bands, but I know some.  Let's name some bands, Rich.  Fight Like Apes.  I like that.  What?  Fight Like Apes.  Who the fuck are they?  Alternative band?  Do you want me to get my iPod out and start?  David Cross is in the band?  David Cross is the band.  Matt and Oswald on drums.  Do we have any rock Fight Like Apes in there? 
[02:19:30]  Are they a newer band?  Not that I'm seeing.  I'm looking.  Are they new?  I don't even, I don't know.  I like Death Cab for Cutie.  I like.  You're an alternative chick.  Off rock, yeah.  No, Death Cab is pretty.  They're good.  Who's the other one?  Arctic Monkeys.  Kind of wimpy, and I'll get beat up for it, but I don't mind.  You guys have heard of these bands, right?  I didn't.  No, I said Fight Like Apes.  I've never heard of.  Is that a newer band?  You're an alternative chick.  The others I've heard of.  No, but then I also, I also, you know, like, sort of like, rockabilly stuff, and. . . 
[02:20:00]  What's rockabilly?  Brian Setzer?  Rockabilly.  The romantic shit.  Oh, I hate Brian Setzer.  That's rockabilly.  I fucking hate the straight cats.  You don't like to put on a zoot suit and see that on?  Straight cats was the first band I ever went and saw live.  Exactly.  They blow.  They're terrible.  Big hair.  We're going to rock this town, are you?  The blacks drink out of a different fountain.  Are you?  I'm fucking heinous. 
[02:20:30]  What does it mean to rock this town, do you think?  Exactly.  Good music.  It seems like. . .  Dice loves these guys, too.  I think they're fucking. . .  Who's this?  Brian Setzer.  No, you're awful.  Oh, this is fucking horrendous.  This is terrible.  No, it's a joke.  I know.  You guys, I always flash during rockabilly.  Then turn it off.  Well, maybe you guys should compromise.  Would he let you listen to NPR on the way in and listen to his talk on the way out? 
[02:21:00]  He will not let me listen to anything ever.  I would listen to NPR.  He just can't find it on the radio anywhere.  I listen to NPR.  It's like a dreadful all of a sudden.  I'm telling you. . .  It's FM.  It's FM.  That's why.  Because you're on AM all the time.  I would listen to NPR.  You've got to listen to this.  They're ridiculous fucking points of view.  Why don't you just listen to some of them?  About the Golan Heights.  I do.  The Golan Heights.  Not Golan.  The Golan Heights.  The Golan Heights.  Oh.  The Golan Heights.  Oh, fuck.  I'm directing everybody.  It's a big concert downstairs. 
[02:21:30]  You know, I listen to everything, man.  I just like to listen to talk in the car.  I can't.  I used to if you're going to gigs.  Maybe I'm not in the car enough anymore, but I used to listen to Bob Grant, Jay Diamond.  I used to love those fucking.  Jay Diamond was good back in the day.  I hate. . .  When I hear someone just talking, I, uh, click.  As soon as I hear that.  You know, uh, click.  Click.  Obama.  According to God.  Click.  Yeah, but you'll do those shows on TV.  Exactly.  I would rather hear myself talking and being funny. 
[02:22:00]  And you were great the last time I saw you do it.  Thank you.  You were fucking great on it.  Yeah, I just don't like listening to them.  I just don't like. . .  And it's not just because of the liberals, either.  I don't want to hear any of these fucking. . .  Blabbermouths.  I don't want to hear them.  Exactly.  They're not interesting to me.  Fucking, uh, you know, uh, according to Obama.  Boo!  I love it.  I love it.  Shut up.  We have the couch of zilches here, so we should probably break here.  Oh, they're here.  Yeah.  Couch of zilches.  Yeah, we have to move you up here.  Yeah, because you're not a zilch. 
[02:22:30]  You're not a zilch.  And the chair of honor.  Oh.  Which has Rich's shit on it right now.  That's right.  That's not mine.  That's mine.  Oh.  Tom's shit is on the chair of honor.  I got that fucking backpack.  I got a Louis Vuitton.  That's a Louis Vuitton purse.  So a man purse.  What are the plugs?  We got Bonnie at Magoobie's in Baltimore next weekend.  Magoobie's.  Please come see me.  Next weekend.  Somebody.  Next Friday and Saturday.  Bonnie's hilarious.  Yeah, Bonnie's great.  You'll have a really good time.  Magoobie's.  M-A-G-O-O-B-Y-S dot com for tickets.  It's really dirty and horrible and O-N-A fans will go. 
[02:23:00]  And Vaughn's hilarious.  Fucking Uncle Vinny's in Point Pleasant this weekend.  Yeah, Friday and Saturday.  You've never done that.  Tonight and tomorrow, right?  They fixed it tonight.  It's a good comedy room if you want to work stuff out.  And Mr. Papa.  Marriage Reef on Sunday night with Brian Regan.  Really?  Yeah.  Where's he been?  In the green room of the marriage ref.  Was he funny?  Yeah, he was great.  Of course he was.  Yeah, he's hilarious.  He's married.  Fuck, I gotta see that.  He's married.  Sunday at 10.  Three years.  No, Brian Regan got married?  Oh, yeah.  He lives in Vegas. 
[02:23:30]  He lives in Vegas.  He lives in Vegas.  Since we've known him.  Yeah.  He's got two grown kids, I think, at this point.  He's funny.  Yes, he is.  And he loves the rock and roll.  And Aaron Paul's coming in it?  Yes, he is.  This is your thing, right?  Breaking Bad?  Breaking Bad.  I've seen that show.  He's like the co-lead guy.  I've only seen the first season.  Yeah, it's good.  I like it.  I've only seen the first two episodes.  I haven't seen the whole show.  It's good.  Yeah, more stuff.  It's great.  It's great.  Good.  Silly Goose has something for Jimmy. 
[02:24:00]  Come on, Jimmy.  You don't want to jump driving well.  Exactly.  Fucking hate that stuff.  Let's take swing classes, Jim.  I'm so happy that shitty fucking swing dance phase went down my floor.  Fuck you.  Girls in big black and white shoes and guys in suspenders.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  No, no, no, no, go fuck yourself.  I like this.  I like this.  It's fucking horrid. 
[02:24:30]  They're all clapping their hands.  We're all, jazzy fun.  Fun and jazzy.  Ironic in Brooklyn and Williamsburg.  I like it.  I got big pants with suspenders.  What kind of music do you like?  Sabbath.  Oh, God, yeah.  But I understand I'm very narrow music.  Yeah.  It's the only, it's the only, it's your narrow.  You like this one, Jimmy?  This is different, I think.  This is good.  45 years ago, I see it.  I hate it. 
[02:25:00]  It's Big Bandy.  It's just not me.  It's so close to the guy from my house.  Right?  Yeah, da, tootie, da, to.  Yeah.  Say, how do I get a guy to dance with me around here?  With legs like that, it shouldn't be a problem.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I set up pins.  That's right.  Bring me a lemonade, nigga.  Let's try it out.  Wow.  Those getaway sticks.  Oh, God.  That's the way they spoke back in the fucking 40s.  Jim in the 40s.  They always forget that this music was a very racist time in our country.  It's terrible. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Last year.  Can a fellow get some balls on his nose?  Oh, God.  I'm going for her because how good she looks.  Well, I'm going for her because she looks.  Jim in 1945.  What's a fellow got to do?  She's way prettier than Sarah Palin.  You're not even explaining who you're talking to.  Who is she?  Michelle Bachman.  What do you think of Michelle Bachman?  Look at her eyes.  She has beautiful eyes.  Oh, my God.  What's her big platform?  She does have nice eyes.  You're right.  What's that?  Well, I don't agree with her.  She's fucking anti-gay marriage. 
[02:26:00]  She's anti-abortion, which is none of my fucking business.  Yeah, of course.  Another hateable, unwinnable candidate by the fucking Republicans.  They really are dumb.  No one is voting for her.  Yeah, you're right.  That fucking stupid helmet hairdo.  Ease up on the chewing.  I can't take it.  Rich, you're a slave.  Can you just not do it?  Watch what you're saying nowadays.  If Rich breathes the wrong way, it's just like, please stop it.  Please kill yourself.  Whenever I hear those stories about people who stab their husbands or their wives or whatever, 
[02:26:30]  I'm always like, where did they get that knife?  I got to get one of those knives.  How long have you been married now?  It's our fifth and final year.  Fifth.  Wow.  That was a good run.  She's closing on that.  No, isn't it six years?  I don't know.  Something.  Rich, are you a lot happier in the marriage?  You have to start.  Happy about what?  Being married.  I really enjoy it.  You don't seem to have any problems with money. 
[02:27:00]  Why would you let Jimmy touch you, Rich?  Yeah, he's so shy.  First of all, he's a creep.  Look at those hands.  He'll come.  I'm telling you.  Just let him touch you.  I don't come quick all the time.  We have good sex.  All the time.  Sometimes you do.  The couch is zilch.  Let's just get a break.  All right, we should.  Okay.  Do they literally sit on the couch?  Remember Superman when those fucking monsters came up from the center of the earth?  You've got to remember, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  That's ancient. 
[02:27:30]  Were they the cartoon or the movie?  The movie.  The TV show.  The TV show.  The old, old TV show.  I know.  You should have been in high school.  You were home watching that.  I want to hear more about how Rich comes really fast.  I don't come.  Sometimes I do.  Sometimes I fucking tear that puss up, man.  Does he, Bonnie?  Does he?  What a hopeless romantic.  Yeah, yeah.  He's good.  Is Rich a good dirty talker?  He is a good dirty talker.  But he likes to talk.  He likes to hear himself.  Does he talk about sexual stuff?  Does he ever go off topic a little bit? 
[02:28:00]  Obamacare.  Yeah, I'm going to fuck you like the way liberals are fucking us.  The virus, Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Who's that whispering in the tree? 
[02:28:30]  Let's do this.  What do you got on this, Jimmy?  This is terrible.  I mean, look, they might be good musicians and good singers.  I just don't like it.  It was good dancing music, though, if you dance.  Back then, yeah.  But I mean, never.  No, I mean, in the clubs when people, you know, back in the 80s when we used to go to clubs, 
[02:29:00]  there would be bands that would play a rock and roll song.  I never remember that.  I don't.  I remember Rich and Bobby Socks.  I'd have, you know, you'd put on your zoot suit.  We should get these people.  Yeah, just to reset, we got Tom Poppa, of course.  Marriage Ref Sunday at 10 o'clock with Brian Regan.  See, I remember.  Brian Regan, yeah.  Bonnie McFarlane next weekend, Friday and Saturday, McGoobie's in Baltimore.  See, I remember.  And Voss, Uncle Vinny's tonight and tomorrow.  Point Pleasant.  Point Pleasant. 
[02:29:30]  Could you see Brian being so clean, just kind of really opening up?  She doesn't like threesomes.  I'd get pissed off because I like two vaginas.  Like, that would be so cool.  You're like, what the fuck is he saying?  We know he has it in him.  Brian's not performing.  He's a different person.  Brian can have a lot of fun after a gig if you go out.  Now, this is years ago.  We don't know.  Go out drinking a few shots.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He'll open up a little.  He'll open up. 
[02:30:00]  He'll start sounding like Richard Pryor.  He'll start.  No way.  You know what he'll do?  He'll lean on the bar, like, real low with his arms and start looking side to side and  go and say stuff like, hey, look at that motherfucker over there.  It's like, wow.  No way.  I think that Regan Irish comes out and gets a few shots.  And with a white girl, no less.  Squeaky clean Brian.  Yeah, squeaky clean Regan.  She won't strap on a dildo and fuck me in the ass. 
[02:30:30]  How's the marriage supposed to last?  She said I get shit on it.  I'm going to put a little shit.  He's fucking great, man.  I love Brian.  I'm going to wash the dildo.  I'm going to wash the dildo.  I mean, hey, I put it in the dishwasher.  I'm going to wash it.  I'm washing my dildo.  I'm a washer.  I'm a dildo washer. 
[02:31:00]  She's going to shove, put it in my ass.  I'm like, how do I get this goodness in me?  I'm putting it in.  It won't go any further.  She queefs.  It sounds like whale noises.  Oh, fuck, man.  Yes.  Oh, that's Brian.  Oh, Brian.  Oh, Brian.  We've just completely perverted his acting.  You ever watch a guy buying a dozen dildos?  I don't remember the rest of the donut picture. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  I'll take two of the big black ones.  She's trying to do the scanner.  She's trying to scan my dildo plugs.  You have eight left.  Oh, no.  I'll take a fist.  I'll get the veiny one with the ball sack on it.  And the one that vibrates so she can fuck my mouth.  It looks like Lincoln. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, poor Brian.  He's honed that act.  Brian's a pig.  He's squeaky clean.  He's doing it in front of families.  We perverted it.  Couch of Zilch's time.  Oh, yes, it is.  Of course it is.  I don't understand this part.  Well, the Couch of Zilch's.  We used to have a big studio where we could pull in a live audience every Friday.  Hold on.  We introduced them there.  What's wrong with you?  Just don't drag them in.  Nice live studio audience.  It kind of gave us the opportunity to talk to people and figure out how fucked up people  are. 
[02:32:30]  And sometimes we'd actually get someone like Bobo off of it and shit like that.  So we figured we don't have room for that.  And it's not being honest.  It's a time killer to get us to 10 o'clock on a Friday.  Yeah, it really is.  To get us to 10 on a Friday.  Come on, 10.  10 o'clock.  This is their contest.  And they don't have anything to give away because series is so fucking cheap.  I'm not a cheap.  We're giving you space on the couch.  That's your prize.  So I figured if we just bring in four or five or so people to sit on the couch, we can kind  of talk to them and see if they're at all interesting. 
[02:33:00]  Right.  Our first attempt at this.  Nothing.  Well, no one was interesting.  Hold on.  But then the contest is you start on the couch of Zilch's and one person is picked by the  lovely Jimmy Norton to sit in the chair of honor.  The chair of honor.  And now we've got a chair of honor song.  Oh, wow.  Let's bring them in.  This is fucking wacky radio.  One at a time or you want to just bring them all in?  Rich, you have a chair of honor in your house?  We might as well bring them all in because we're at 9-12 and we have a guest.  All right.  Uncle Paul. 
[02:33:30]  Oh, Aaron Paul.  Aaron Paul's coming in.  Yay.  From Breaking Bad.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  New season starts up.  How are you?  Yeah.  Oh, look at you.  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  Welcome.  How are you doing?  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.  Couch of Zilch's.  We got four people.  Ladies.  I saw last week.  You have lovely feet, madam.  Oh.  You're in the salt and tarjacks.  I like that.  I like your pop.  No, I like big, long feet.  I really do.  Mad Magazine feet. 
[02:34:00]  Jimmy's been mentioning feet lately.  I have been.  What's that about?  I like your pop.  I don't know.  I'm not turned on by them.  You've been mentioning feet lately.  I've noticed.  It's just something I'm noticing more in the summer.  But it's not a sexual turn on for me unless I'm with somebody.  But I can look at you.  Oh, they look very nice.  Look at your feet.  She doesn't like your feet, though.  What?  Big feet.  I hate feet.  I'm with you.  I'm not a feet guy.  Let me see.  You got your toes.  A foot guy.  She's learned, because of her big, long feet, she's learned how to crunch her toes up so  they don't extend over the flip-flop.  How fast can you swim? 
[02:34:30]  Holy fuck.  It's like a fucking hot flipper.  I would never notice.  I just don't notice.  Yeah.  You can have great feet, horrible feet.  I just don't notice.  She's very, very beautiful.  Yeah.  What's your name there?  I'm pretty good at judging tootsies.  Not on a sexual level, but just in a, you know, if you're in a club or something, you  look down, and you see a girl's feet, and they're kind of a little scraggly.  Let me see.  They're not long, but they're nice.  No, they're big, but nice.  That's good.  They're nice feet.  Yeah, you got it. 
[02:35:00]  She put a tattoo of a smaller foot on her.  Yes.  Yes.  She tattooed shrubs around it, so it looks like there's other things.  She's got money, man.  Look at her pocketbook.  You got money?  Yeah.  She's got money.  Oh, is that a Louis Vuitton?  I live in Levittown.  Wait, why is it in Levittown?  Oh, Levittown.  Very good.  We're in Levittown, bro.  Home of Governor's Comedy Club.  Governor's Comedy Club.  Put her mic's on.  I'll be there in August.  I don't know what else to do.  I've turned everything I can on.  Did you just say you'll be there last weekend?  August. 
[02:35:30]  Okay.  Because that's kind of funny.  I'll be there last weekend.  Is the mic on?  Try it again, Sam.  Check, check, check, check.  Yeah, now it's on.  What's your name?  Sam.  Sam, and you're from...  Oh, Sam and Sam.  Perfect.  I'm from Yonkos, originally.  One's more feminine.  Figure it out.  And she's a good-looking blonde.  Not a dig on you, Missy.  Your wife.  You think?  A little bit.  A little bit.  That's a couple.  I'm looking at...  Are you married?  Yeah.  How long?  Almost a year. 
[02:36:00]  Okay.  No, he meant as his cock.  Yes.  My husband's very jealous that I'm here right now.  Oh, really?  Is he a big fan?  Oh, boy.  Why is he not here?  I couldn't bring anyone with me.  Who told you that?  The email.  Oh.  That's my direction.  We got a loose cock blocker.  He's jealous because he wanted to come and meet Obi-Anthony.  Or he's jealous because he doesn't trust you in front of...  Really?  Really?  Look at these people.  Yeah.  He saw them.  Please.  Look at all...  Look at this fucking...  Look at that face, okay? 
[02:36:30]  Looks like I took a bite out of a claymore.  I had a fight with my pool.  Oh, really?  Lost terribly.  Oh, Jesus.  Pool.  What, on a dive?  Not a scratch.  Yeah, I dove, but I didn't hit the bottom.  I was coming back up, and the wall was there, and I scrapped my head and my nose just...  But the best part about it, we had Uriah Faber in yesterday, a UFC fighter who lost his  fight.  Lost his UFC fight.  And he was in there yesterday.  Not a scratch on him.  An antlers.  Like this. 
[02:37:00]  From a pool incident.  Were you straight?  Quite the hit.  Please.  I was in my pool.  Yes.  I was drunk.  I never go in the pool sober.  He couldn't have been drunker.  Oh, really?  He couldn't have been drunk.  I was like...  I was at that party?  Oh, really?  Oh, my God.  This was just an evening.  This was just an evening.  Jimmy was calling me Mrs. William Shatner.  I was like, Kaylee...  Oh, no way around.  Oh, too soon.  Oh, that's...  She's dead.  Victim of the modern age.  You poor, poor girl. 
[02:37:30]  Okay, so what's your name?  Bad one.  Sam, I'm sorry.  Sam from Lovatown.  What kind of work do you do?  PR.  Oh, that's a little racist.  Get Mars in here.  She's asking for Mars.  Oh.  Oh, sorry.  I mistook that.  What kind of PR do you do?  Beauty.  Beauty?  Beauty.  What do you mean?  You're public relations for a beauty company?  Mm-hmm.  For like super cuts or something?  Super cuts?  Jesus.  Give her a little more credit.  It's Levittown.  It is Levittown.  Oh, well, you know what?  You're kind of right.  What's your husband do? 
[02:38:00]  He does corporate insurance brokerage.  Oh, okay.  That's yeah.  That's okay.  Let me guess.  You live in a small, cape-like house that you've put an extension on.  Yep.  Gotta love Levittown.  They all look the same.  You have any kids?  Yes.  No.  We just moved there in November.  Oh, okay.  We just put a pool in.  We're trying to have compound parties like Anthony.  Ah, very good.  Not working out?  Watch out for your nose.  Why not?  We can't hang as late as he can.  You need a lot of booze. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah.  That seems to be what makes those parties is booze.  We're doing a Long Island block party.  Do you know a lot of junior high school students who can invite you?  Yeah, the face hockey mask might help.  Yeah.  That could be like a swimmies.  The neighborhood kids won't invite us.  Yay.  Oh, blah.  I'm the worst.  Wait, the famous Long Island block party?  I heard you say that.  Yep.  I've never been to one, but I guess it's what happened.  They're horrible.  What, block parties?  Oh, black parties.  I've been to a couple of those.  Fourth of July block parties.  Yeah, not too bad.  You get to see a lot of young girls with hot asses. 
[02:39:00]  You know, it's fun when they had the whole block garage sale in the whole area.  Oh, you would love that.  Why the garage sale?  Just trading garbage.  I went to a garage sale and the guy goes, are you rich for us?  Oh, God.  I'm selling your CD.  And he goes, what happened to you?  Oh, shit.  Nothing.  I'm a big deal.  How much for the shirt? 
[02:39:30]  Let's get to know the other people, too.  Yes.  Why?  Exactly.  We have to.  We're polite.  Who are you, sir?  I'm Eric from New Jersey.  Hi, Eric.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  What part of Jersey?  Union County.  Oh, that's where we're from.  By Elizabeth and stuff.  Sure.  Yeah, Roselle Park.  Nice.  Jimmy, how is that?  You're a Jersey guy.  I'm from Plainfield.  I'm from Union County.  Oh, okay.  Well, we're not talking to you.  Stop getting jealous because he asked Jim.  I know.  I asked Jim because I know Jim's from Jersey.  You wonder why when you go to McGoobs, you're going to have to say, I fell again. 
[02:40:00]  Those little hands couldn't possibly leave a mark.  Oh, fucking funny.  Oh, man.  What else we got on Eric?  So, Eric, what do you do?  I go to Kean University.  I do a shitty college radio show.  Right.  Nice.  Yeah, yeah.  So do we.  Yeah, so do we do, too.  Oh, Chip, I said that.  So, what's the name of your college radio show? 
[02:40:30]  The Relic Radio Show.  Because it's my last name backwards, Keller, Relic, I don't know.  That's good.  But they called it the Big E.  PDs will love that, by the way.  What's that?  PDs will love that.  Oh, will they?  Yeah.  But everything they love sucks.  You can remember that, too.  Getting a little lesson here.  Well, they named it for me.  They named it the Big E because it's a little urban, kind of, and I hate that name.  Yeah.  So, the Big N. 
[02:41:00]  It's a little more urban.  Yeah, I try to do the talk thing, but when I run out of steam, I just throw on some music  and shit.  Hey, it's a good luxury.  You know what I mean?  We just did it today.  We did some Sabbath today.  Why don't you like black people?  What's the reason?  I never said that, man.  I'm just saying.  Oh, I'm just asking.  I'm just saying I'm the only whitey at the station, you know?  You're the only white guy?  I think so.  Basically, I don't know.  I never see anyone there, but the only people I do see, I know they play a lot of R&B and hip-hop,  you know what I mean?  What kind of, so could you do a break, like throw to a song, like how would you throw 
[02:41:30]  to a song?  In the way you talk on the air?  Just, let's see, I'll throw in some Ozzy.  This is War Pigs right now by, oh shit.  No, do an R&B song, like you do at work.  Yeah, do you have to like hip-hop it up a bit?  Oh, no, no, absolutely not.  Boy, no, they give me all the freedom to be myself.  Give me all the freedom.  That's more than white people did for them.  Well, you know, years ago, anyway.  So you're the white guy, but you don't have to like, you know, shuck and jive it up with 
[02:42:00]  you.  No, no, they say just do what you want.  No one pays attention.  I have like one listener, it's my girlfriend, and you know, it's kind of just for practice,  trying to understand the art of radio.  Okay, throw to a song.  How would you throw to a song like that?  It's like, all right, I'm running out of steam here, so here's, you know, Crazy Train by  Ozzy Osbourne.  I like it, very natural.  No?  Bad.  Is that bad?  What's wrong?  Rich was saying she looked like one of the ladies on Fox, Samantha. 
[02:42:30]  Who?  That lady.  Oh, it could be one of the reporters on Fox, yeah.  Just nine points.  Thanks for distracting you all.  Appreciate it.  All right, well, are we done with Eric?  Did he nail you?  What did he say?  I have no idea.  So, okay, Eric, who's the other man here?  Hey, what's going on?  How you doing?  I'm Brian Finley.  Hi, Brian.  Irish guy, right?  Hi, Brian Finley.  Fireman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  An Irish fireman.  You don't say he's a fireman.  I want to be a fireman when I grow up.  He is in my fantasy. 
[02:43:00]  So, you're a full-time firefighter.  Fireman right here in Manhattan.  He's a rich?  Oh, nasty rich.  I've got some of that.  Holy shit.  I've got some of that in my face.  What did he do?  What happened?  He spit his gum.  Spit his gum out in a paper towel, but it went everywhere.  It splattered.  He spit it like he was in a contest.  Wow.  Is it weird not doing that out of a guy's window?  I almost said windshield, but then realized, no. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I should blow someone in a jalopy.  It's very good.  A jalopy.  A fucking Jeep with the windshield down.  You just spit on your wife.  Sucking off a soldier from the 40s.  Rich Ross spit.  What the fuck?  Well, I usually have to spit to get in, so what the fuck's the difference?  What do you mean?  What?  Oh, boy.  It's terrible.  Rich.  It was dirty.  You learn anything from that hip-hop there?  Not at all.  Yeah, good.  You got a nice tattoo.  Let me see that.  That's a stupid tattoo I got when I was 17.  That's a nice work, though.  It's all right.  I like the insides a little more better. 
[02:44:00]  If you could add a star of David to it, it'd be perfect.  I was young and stupid, so, you know.  Yeah.  What, you regret it now?  Oh, yeah, a little bit.  Really?  It's an all right piece.  A little bit.  We got a big star here.  It looks like an 80s metal toy.  Oh, we have?  Yes.  Aaron Paul.  Aaron Paul.  He saw our show last week.  Let's ask him how funny it was.  Was it funny?  Yeah, it was actually, it was really cool.  And the best part of it was afterwards when Rich was standing out on the sidewalk selling  his CDs and yelling at the people congregating in front of him that they're blocking him. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, they're blocking myself.  They're blocking.  I'm trying to kill you.  You don't get paid in New York, right?  I do hate when people say surprisingly it was really good.  I mean, we beat the shit out of him, but man, Rich does a great job.  No surprise.  It was no surprise at all.  He does a great job on the radio and on the stage of Bonnie.  Cool.  Can we, hey, let's bring in Aaron Paul.  Yeah, let's bring in Aaron Paul.  Yeah, where are we going to put him?  We got to get him in the chair of honor.  The chair of honor.  Ah, there he is.  Wow.  I know this guy.  It's like, hey, I know this guy. 
[02:45:00]  What the fuck I know this guy?  I know.  We have the, how you doing, Anthony?  Opie, bro.  How are you?  Nice to meet you.  Nice to meet you, too.  And for the 80th time, I have to explain, look, I don't normally look like this.  I had a fight with my fool.  He doesn't care.  He didn't even notice.  Actually, I look like you in every episode.  I know.  You get the shit beat out of you constantly.  They love, they love.  They love beating you to a pulp.  Throwing me down.  Yes.  You're Jesse, of course.  I'm breaking bad.  Jesse Pinkman.  And I didn't watch the show from the beginning when it was actually on, but somebody turned me 
[02:45:30]  onto the DVDs, and it was one of those where I popped the first one in and went, all right.  That's it.  Captured.  That first episode grabs it, because you don't know what the fuck is going on.  Yeah.  And from there, it just gets better and better.  It's so good.  Yeah.  It's so good.  I started smoking meth.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It really is.  It's great.  It kind of does make you want to do meth.  Yeah, it really does.  Because it just looks so fun. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  They're just like so excited when they do it and everything.  I literally just started.  I'm only two episodes into the box set, because I know the new season's starting.  What happens after the acid bleeds through the ceiling?  I'm kidding.  That's where I am.  The melted body falls through.  Yeah.  That's where I am right now.  I've only seen the first two.  That is a good one.  And yeah, you screwing things up like that really makes the show, because obviously you  got Brian, who's very technical and knows his shit, and you're just like, yeah, well, 
[02:46:30]  you get a plastic tub when I can use the metal bathtub.  I can do this.  He learns stuff on that show.  Bad idea.  You really do.  Yeah.  Have you been watching it and thinking like, I think I could make meth?  Yes.  I'm going to have to be Del's advocate.  I don't get it.  No.  I don't understand the story.  No, you watch the first two seasons, and this has nothing to do with you, but it's  taken forever to get the third season on DVD on Amazon.  Is it out? 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, actually, it just came out.  It just came out?  Yeah.  He's having a problem with his iTunes download.  Could you call somebody here?  Can you go to his house and work on it?  Hey, wait, listen.  Exactly.  My wife and I are comics, and we don't like talking to each other, so we got to watch this  kind of stuff.  You know what I mean?  Two fucking seasons.  You know how much conversation we...  Rich, what is the show about for the people out there that don't know?  It's about...  It's about...  You want me to tell you?  It's about a school teacher who thinks he has a certain amount of time to live. 
[02:47:30]  He has cancer, so he wants to leave his family with a little nest egg.  Right.  And he's a chemist, so he realizes, hey, I can make money making meth because it's big.  They kill people throughout the show.  There's never an investigation.  People are dead.  Okay.  The guy's selling meth in front of his brother-in-law, who's supposedly a big DEA agent.  Okay?  But it's fucking good.  All right?  But that's just it.  It's not like the killings of Son of Anarchy, where they kill you right in front of a cop 
[02:48:00]  and they don't investigate.  There's drugs behind it.  It is, but I see it as they're like drug skills.  They're scum.  Like, a lot of times, you don't really want to investigate so much into that shit.  Have you ever been in an interview where you didn't speak at all?  No, actually, this is fantastic.  I love watching you guys talk.  It really is.  No, I'd much rather be in this situation.  We're just looking at Aaron going, right?  Yeah.  And I just said, yes, yes, you're absolutely right.  No, I do want to ask you a couple of things, I gather. 
[02:48:30]  You were not supposed to be in the full show.  No.  You were just supposed to do...  Yeah, Jesse was supposed to die at the end of the first season.  Oh, man.  Now, what changed that?  I guess you did a good job.  Yeah, thank God they decided to keep him around.  They just...  Vince, our creator, kind of just loved the tug-of-war, odd couple, like, beating head element of Walt  and Jesse's characters.  Yeah, I couldn't imagine what they would have done if you weren't in it, because it would 
[02:49:00]  have been kind of one-sided.  It does give that kind of two guys that are complete opposite ends of the spectrum.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, this type of show is like, you never know if you're going to die or not.  Yeah.  There's a lot of our main cast that'll just meet their demise.  Yeah, when I first started watching it, and I was trying to stay away from spoilers.  I don't know any spoilers.  No, I'm not going to say any. 
[02:49:30]  But people are like, there are these holy shit moments where you literally sit there  and just go, holy shit, no way.  No fucking way that just happened.  Right.  Or that person got killed or whatever.  So wait, when you got hired, you knew you were supposed to die at the end of the first season?  No, I had no idea.  Oh, you didn't?  Yeah, I mean, I've done so many pilots, and none of them ever, you know, see the light  of day, and this is the first one that I did that actually got picked up.  And I just thought I got a series regular gig, but they told me towards the end of the season 
[02:50:00]  they were going to plan to kill off the character.  And then they decided.  Hey, we got some bad news.  Yeah, exactly.  You're going to die.  Don't tell him.  Yeah, no spoilers.  It's depressing.  When he came in, his publicist was outside, and she's looking.  I'm going, oh, she recognizes me.  And it was stupid fucking Tom Papa.  Of course she recognizes Tom.  I work with her, too.  Tom's a big star on my show.  Tom has a show on NBC.  You were on Between Fucking Whisk commercials in 1997. 
[02:50:30]  You depressed me because you look like what I would want to look like.  It's true.  I was thinking that.  He's me.  Oh, shit.  He's me if I was really handsome and thin.  He's the shape.  Right, right.  He's the shape, yeah.  He's the perfect Norton.  You're what I could have been.  No, you couldn't.  No, you couldn't.  Well, you know, little bulls during pregnancy.  You might have heard him.  And he can act.  He knows what to do with his hands. 
[02:51:00]  I'm not like Jimmy.  Jimmy doesn't know what to do with his hands.  His eyes don't pop out after every scene.  I do.  What do you do?  That's the hardest part.  I always ask real actors.  When I act, I don't.  Like, I'm talking.  My hands are very still, and it's fine.  But I don't know how to work my hands when I act.  It's a fucking nightmare.  I literally am all over the place.  You're not a working mouth.  He's a puppet.  They're all over the place.  It's uncomfortable.  Maybe hold something.  That's a good idea.  But every scene I'm holding things.  Where are you going to put a black cock on every set? 
[02:51:30]  Your mouth.  Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  Exactly.  Wow.  Now, Brian Cranston's your co-star.  Yeah.  Everybody knows him from Malcolm.  Malcolm in the Middle.  Right.  And he played like a pretty goofy guy in that.  And you could see pieces of that come through in Breaking Bad.  Is he more like that? 
[02:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  Or on the set?  Brian Cranston is a child trapped in a man's body.  Yeah.  That's what it comes across as.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's incredible.  His girlfriend's a child trapped in his house.  All right, Rich.  Who, me?  Yeah.  Me.  Who, what?  All right.  That's pretty funny.  I don't go for 50-year-old women.  Sorry.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Hey.  Look at me.  No, you're not 50.  You got me, huh? 
[02:52:30]  How old are you?  I look beaten down because I've been with him.  I wasn't even applying it.  So, Bonnie, how old is Bonnie?  Come back.  You made me uncomfortable.  You better not walk out.  It's just another excuse for me to use meth.  That's all.  Bonnie's in her late 30s.  Yeah.  That's absolutely where I'd put you.  In her late 30s?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, mid.  No, she looks good.  I'm telling you.  Trouble.  A lady never tells me.  You know, I just tried to fucking... 
[02:53:00]  What happened to the interview?  I don't know.  Bonnie jumped on me.  We all have this weird stuff going on.  We have this weird dynamic.  We're happy you're here.  I'm attracted to a married woman in the corner and it's giving her the creeps.  I keep looking at her long toes and I want to touch them.  It's awful.  We haven't even interviewed fucking Hubble telescope eyes over here.  We'll get to him at some point.  Exactly.  We'll get to Carl from Sling Blade in a second.  I want to talk about her and how she and I can be on Land of the Lost with those sleet  stack feet.  I'm very... 
[02:53:30]  I'm kidding, of course.  I like you a lot.  I love her big feet.  She's very sexy.  Jesus.  All right.  So, Brian, he won an Emmy for this?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's won the past three years in a row.  It's amazing because his acting is...  I guess I underestimate him because he was just in a sitcom for the most part and kind  of playing the goofy dad part.  But, man, he's good.  He's really good.  Yeah, he's great.  He gets that whole thing going of the fear and confusion. 
[02:54:00]  And he played the cancer guy really well, too.  I was kind of a little skeptical at first watching it because I'm thinking like, oh, God, I hate  watching shows like this because I always think I have something.  If I watch something where someone's sick in the show, at least they didn't really dwell  on it a lot.  He was coughing up blood.  I wasn't.  I felt I was okay.  You're in the clear.  Yeah, I was pretty much in the clear.  But I guess the first...  And this isn't a spoiler because it happens.  The first killing that takes place that he is responsible for, you know, hands-on and eye-to-eye 
[02:54:30]  is frightening.  Yeah.  Because you really do kind of get to know that person.  And I think he did a fantastic job on that one.  Yeah, he's terrifying.  How many girls now are all over you because you're on this fucking show?  I mean, you've got to be...  He would have girls all over him even if he was in the middle.  Well, you're at your age, of course.  I'm talking about...  I'm talking about young...  You know.  I think I can speak. 
[02:55:00]  I'm talking about girls that you let stay over.  You know what I mean?  Right.  No, I mean, are you from L.A.?  I am.  All right, so...  How many questions are you going to ask the guy?  You ask them two different...  Let him answer one first.  Then ask the second one.  I want to hear the girl thing, too.  Of course I do.  Do you have girls all over you?  Are you from L.A.?  What airline do you fly?  How many things are you going to ask them?  I'm sorry.  Can you take your bag?  Can you give me a copy of the DVD?  I would like to call Amazon. 
[02:55:30]  So, yeah, you're from L.A. originally?  No, Idaho originally.  But I've been in L.A. since I was 17.  All right.  And has the woman situation improved a lot since you've been on the show?  It's a little different, but I don't know.  I'm in a very serious, you know, kind of relationship.  Oh, long term?  Yeah.  Were you in it when you started, when you got the gig?  No.  Oh, you got involved after?  How long, how many seasons in did you meet the girl?  Three.  Oh, so you have time.  All right, you got it out of your system.  Two, yeah.  That's fucked the first time.  Got it out of his system. 
[02:56:00]  Yeah, first two seasons, you go fucking crazy.  Yeah, exactly.  And then you meet somebody who...  And then settle down.  Yeah, that's kind of nice.  I wouldn't know.  I've only been on a series that lasted one season.  But I imagine if it was a second one, all right.  Yeah, you're working on it.  Yeah, whatever.  You're working on it.  You can get, you know, when you're on TV like that, you can get, like, clothing and  shit.  Can you talk to him, like...  You know what I mean?  He's talking about...  He's talking about pilfering from the set.  He's trying to get swag.  No, he's talking about getting swag.  He loves to barter. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, but the clothes that I wear on the show are just...  They're all, like, triple XL, like, giant.  Give him the Norton when you're done.  Nothing.  But that's just me, Rich.  I got greedy.  It's all right.  Did you have to hang out and watch some meth heads to figure out how to...  I did, yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Because I was watching and going, like, yeah, that kind of looks like what meth would look  like.  Yeah, yeah.  I definitely surrounded myself with a lot of those characters.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I went to rehabs, and it was an interesting time. 
[02:57:00]  A real disturbing scene is when you're having sex with that hooker thing in the room, and  I was like...  Wendy.  Yeah.  I was kind of like, oh, what's he doing there?  What's he doing?  It's got to be some kind of...  What's wrong with Wendy?  She's just a disaster.  Meth head.  She's fat?  No, but she's, like, got meth fucking...  Yeah, she's our crack whore of the show.  Oh, yeah.  She's great, but, yeah, she's definitely the crack whore.  Who plays her?  This local actress in Albuquerque. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, okay.  Yeah, they completely ugly her up.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, she's not quite that bad?  No.  The girl that played your girlfriend was really attractive.  Yeah, Kristen Ritter.  Oh, man, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  Definitely.  No, I'm not farting.  I actually...  Somebody...  It's got to be Jimmy.  No, actually, it's not.  It wasn't?  No.  Someone got nervous on the couch of Zilchers.  It's one of the couch of Zilchers.  Who got nervous?  Because you stuck the guy in the studio.  I was doing an interview. 
[02:58:00]  It was Sam?  Oh, I'm in love.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, she's a good egg.  Is it really you?  No, she's bad.  Who for it?  It's really bad.  I'm sorry.  It's really bad.  It had to be Jimmy.  Jimmy, was it you?  I don't want to smell what it is.  No, I would tell you.  Wow.  I wish it was me.  Why won't anyone admit it?  Oh, for the door.  I don't know.  Tom, was it you?  No, good Lord.  This must be what it smells like in the meth lab without the gas mask on when everybody  just falls down.  Can you give yourself a car crash?  You're not smelling it all day.  I will.  I'll try.  Really?  You should come up over here. 
[02:58:30]  It's really bad.  Save you.  Now whoever farts now is going to get blamed for the last one.  You people are terrible.  That really does stink the whole place up.  Yeah, that was awful.  I suck.  Good Lord.  One of our new people, I think, is fucking nervous.  Yeah, I know.  Someone admitted.  I gotta apologize.  No, this is a really fun room.  Messing up this whole fucking...  What press are you doing today?  Another risk of having 20 people in the room. 
[02:59:00]  Do you have a bunch of radio shows?  Yeah, I'm hanging out in this building and hopping around.  Oh, you're doing a junkie at a bunch of...  Okay.  Any TV today?  I don't know.  I honestly have no idea what I'm doing.  I think we're having Brian on Monday.  Yeah, he's coming in.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck, I wish I had something to get signed.  It's really cool.  Yeah, now see, we've had two signed things.  I gotta get that dirty.  I ain't got nothing.  I ain't got nothing.  I saw the first three episodes of the fourth season.  Oh, what do you think?  I'm psyched.  Very good.  I've always seen the first of the fourth. 
[02:59:30]  Really, really good, man.  Yeah, it starts off really...  No one's gonna be disappointed.  Yeah.  Yeah, it starts off...  Well, the third season ends like, oh my god.  And then the fourth kicks right in.  The fourth season is definitely our darkest one, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And believe me, the first three were pretty dark.  Yeah.  How many episodes?  Sorry.  No, there's 13 in the fourth.  And so, yeah.  How about the other ones?  There's seven in the first and then 13 in the second and third.  Isn't it weird how cable does things?  It kind of gives you like a freedom that Network never gave. 
[03:00:00]  They had to commit to 22 or whatever.  Yeah.  So if they didn't like it, then shit can it.  But seven, it's like, eh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  It's nice.  Yeah, I went through the first season pretty quickly.  I was like, oh, seven.  And then you get the second one, you're like, wow.  Just sit through the first season in like one sitting.  Yeah.  It's very easy to watch.  And those people are called ONA fans.  Great show, man.  I love it.  You working on anything else while you're off?  Yeah, I mean, I just did an animation series for Disney, Tron Uprising.  And so I've never done any sort of animation stuff. 
[03:00:30]  So it was fun to kind of get into a room and play the villain.  And you also played Weird Al.  Yeah.  Yeah, Weird Al and Funny or Die piece.  I actually just did another Funny or Die called Corky Girl.  It'll be coming out in the next week or so.  Yeah, I like that.  That's just hilarious.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  That shit being hilarious.  Funny or Die is taking off.  I did something for a comedy website.  I forget what it was called.  But once again, I bet the wrong horse. 
[03:01:00]  Kind of funny.  What was the other?  Yeah, exactly.  Sometimes funny.  Moderately amusing dot com.  What was the one right before Funny or Die?  There was a website that was a weird name.  Oh boy, really?  No, no, no.  Do you remember?  No.  Nobody does.  No.  That's the problem.  That's the problem. 
[03:01:30]  You're proving your point.  It had a weird name for a comedy website.  Oh shit.  Ah, great.  Thanks.  By Funny or Die, that's serious shit now.  Richboss.com.  Yeah.  Oh.  Come on.  It ain't gonna work.  Did he get me there?  Sorry, it's gonna work.  Quarter of the day on this one.  He fucking zapped me.  Did they give you a certain amount of episodes like that they're gonna end the show?  Is there an end date or just let's keep this thing going? 
[03:02:00]  No, I know Vince, our showrunner, wants to end it on a good note.  He doesn't want to stretch out the storylines too much.  And so I think probably five or six seasons will be done.  Yeah.  And the, what's his name?  The Lawyer is a comic.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's fucking hilarious, man.  Odenkirk.  Yeah.  Oh, Bob Odenkirk?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's goddamn, he's great on that show too.  We did a benefit with him.  It was some Andy Kaufman thing.  House of Blues.  It was so bizarre.  Fucking.  What was it?  No one has ever milked a fucking situation like Bob Zemuda with Andy Kaufman. 
[03:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It was like some 20th anniversary of his death and they were having comedians and, you know,  Andy always said he'd come back after 20 years.  Yeah.  It was fun to do the gig though.  Oh, they showed clips of his movies?  Right.  Jim Carrey's movies?  We did 20, there was, the show was me, Norton, I was hosting Norton, the guy, what's the  name, Bob?  But they had two hours before us of everybody telling Andy Kaufman stories, you know, his  mailman, everybody. 
[03:03:00]  And, you know, the Rooster Press and now our comedy show.  And they brought us up in the fucking middle of this fucking memorial.  So what you're saying is you have a great excuse why people didn't laugh.  Oh, no, I walk down and go, Andy Kaufman, I go, I used to watch Taxi.  I go, what?  No.  He didn't.  See?  Nothing.  See?  Yeah, that must have been an amazing show.  Amazing moment.  Oh, what is that?  Oh, thank you very much.  I texted Roland.  Oh, damn, there it is.  I don't want season three.  I do, I do.  I'm kidding.  Thanks a lot. 
[03:03:30]  Thank you.  I'll give you season one and two.  I have it at home.  I'll give you two.  Well, yeah, well, really?  So are you going to bring Aaron to your house and have him sign it?  Huh?  Dying a fire.  I'm getting him to sign this.  Dying a fire.  Thank you.  Thank you, Roland.  I said to Roland, I texted you.  Do you have anything from Breaking Bags?  I'd like to get it signed.  Well, sign the cover and just let me use the inside and I'll give it back to you.  That's all.  Nah, I don't like the idea of that.  I like to keep my things pristine.  Listen, what's the big deal?  Exactly.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy, I got your answer.  What's that? 
[03:04:00]  E-bombs World?  No.  Comedy site?  No?  That's big.  My video's going viral.  Oh, fuck, I thought I had it.  What's going viral?  One of my television appearances.  What television appearance?  I'm on George Lawrence when the black lady was fucking with me.  I smashed her.  Rich does have a viral video.  It's making a noise.  What year is it from?  Huh?  He's beat down a heckler.  The black First Amendment.  All right, let's talk to Aaron.  I know, right?  Going viral doesn't mean over years.  Hold on, I like this.  Yeah?  He really is.  What's that?  I wanted to talk about a lot of shows, they have these coincidental things that happen. 
[03:04:30]  It's like the After Studio with this fucking asshole.  He's the guest.  Let's just have fucking fun, all right?  When you're dumb.  If you're in the After Studio.  He's got to fucking do this all day.  You wouldn't be in here.  You got these fucking people here.  Okay, all this attention.  He's the co-star.  Let's fucking move on.  I know.  I want to talk about it.  I enjoy it.  Yes.  Your idea of fun is talking about your awful Martin clip.  Nobody knows about that.  And some lady heckled me.  Of course she did.  She wanted her money's worth. 
[03:05:00]  It's gone viral over three years.  Exactly.  Hold on, Tom's back.  Hold on.  You're not getting season three.  I'm just going to start watching from season three and go, I don't know what's happening.  Why do I have to be punished for what he did?  Season one.  I'll do season two.  I don't want season two.  I have season three.  All right.  Thank you very much.  All right.  Let Anthony go.  I wanted to get a, a lot of times coincidental stuff happens and you're watching the show  and go, that ain't going to fuck it. 
[03:05:30]  Like, what are the odds that that would happen and that would happen?  There seems to be, and I'm not going on a limb here, this underlying threat of almost  this cosmic attachment between all the characters.  Yeah.  Like that they're, um, he, uh, I think, I think, uh, uh, Brian kind of is linking all  these people together in some strange way that doesn't seem to just be, oh, let's throw  this and people will believe it.  It is almost some kind of spiritual thing going on with the show.  Yeah.  It feels like it all kind of makes sense in a strange, dark, weird way. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Especially like that one scene with, with, with your chick there that I won't, I'm no  spoiler for me.  I don't.  Ain't getting it from me.  Is it in season three?  Cause I'll see it tonight.  And she is very hot.  She actually made me, uh, look her up on IMDb.  Oh yeah.  To see like, yeah, what she was in.  She's like Dakota Fanning.  She's like, you can't use her anymore.  She's of age.  You got to go with her younger sister now for the joke.  All right.  Are you done with your questions? 
[03:06:30]  Can we move the fuck up?  I know.  Yes.  All right.  It's like the fucking Glenn Close interview.  Enough.  And your Scott interviews.  Hey, what's wrong with our Glenn Close interview?  You did a terrific job that day.  Yeah, you're right.  Fuck this interview.  Ask Rich questions about Rich.  Yeah, yeah.  That's interesting.  Wow.  How did he get such a pretty wife?  That's what I'd ask first.  Jeez.  Cause his nose didn't look like a fucking rich.  But you think she's fucking, look, I hit the pool.  Yeah, you hit the pool.  And you think Bonnie's 50.  Terrible.  I didn't say that at all. 
[03:07:00]  She implied.  We haven't got past that yet.  Right.  I'm still crying about it.  Oh, please.  Oh, come on.  All right, Aaron.  I think Anthony's very good.  I know.  I'm just.  I love the show.  And I'm really glad you came in.  I did prove it.  I know everything that's going on on the show.  Breaking Bad.  When's the premiere?  Sunday, July 17th.  Yes.  10 p.m. on AMC.  Our pal Bill Burr is in it.  I like that.  Do you know Bill Burr?  I saw Bill Burr.  Now, wait a minute.  That is from the fourth season, which isn't out yet. 
[03:07:30]  Right.  So that's a little teaser.  Bill's in it?  Yeah.  Bill had a spot in it.  He told me he's in it a little more, but I haven't seen that.  He plays that guy that was testing the pH of the soil.  Yeah.  That's Bill.  Oh, Billy Burr.  He looked gruffly handsome.  His beard was grown in and everything.  I don't like people with red hair and beards.  He gets more handsome as he gets older than Bill Burr.  He really does.  Yeah, but right here people have thin lips.  No.  It's like kissing a fucking...  It's like a box cutter. 
[03:08:00]  It's fucking horrible.  Their lips are like...  Did it take you that long to think of something thin?  You got greedy.  I looked at you and nothing came to mind.  Fucking swollen fuck.  He got you.  He got you.  I guess we'll continue with our couch of zilches.  You have him here.  Are you going to talk to them?  No, I'm thanking Aaron for coming in.  He's a very famous guy.  He's got to walk around his fucking shithole place.  Where's he going to the Food Network next? 
[03:08:30]  He doesn't want to leave here.  This is fucking big.  You don't want to ask him questions.  You don't want him to leave.  He didn't want to come in.  Yeah.  What?  Yeah, but he'll come back now.  Breaking Bad.  I wish that was a documentary about your teeth.  And there's a big fist on the cover.  I hate Rich.  I wish I had seen more than two episodes.  I'm annoyed.  I want to watch more over the weekend.  So I'm more prepared for Brian.  They're great.  It's a great show to sit down and marathon with the discs. 
[03:09:00]  Everybody talks about that.  It brought my wife and I closer together.  Stop calling me your wife, you cockblock.  Wait, so you guys aren't married?  No, we are.  They are.  She's trying to get some size.  She's miserable.  No, we are married.  Have people been trying to make blue meth?  Like just putting food coloring in it?  I bet they are, right?  Yeah, some people have gotten busted for having blue meth.  Blue meth.  And you know it's just because they put food coloring in it.  What's the difference?  Why are they doing it? 
[03:09:30]  Oh, because it's like celebrity meth.  It's on TV.  Because our meth on the show is blue.  Yeah.  You watched it?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  You were watching the show?  I was watching it, Rich.  Do you know colors?  Glad you're watching it.  Real fan of the show.  Synopsis?  You don't have to be a meth addict.  No.  I'm sorry.  I don't remember the colors.  Oh, to watch the show, you have to be a meth addict.  Yeah.  Oh, we forgot to tell you.  Oh, wait.  Excuse me.  Sorry.  You won't get it unless you've been on meth.  Sorry, fucking research breath.  I don't remember the color of the fucking meth.  Why don't you remember? 
[03:10:00]  That's an easy thing to remember.  Research breath.  Oh, my God.  I remember every episode.  Stop trying to shame people who know things.  You can't just turn your head.  Your whole body has to turn.  He's trying to shame Anthony because he knows the show.  Yeah.  Hey, you're the star of the show.  And what are you doing watching it and asking him questions about it?  Yeah.  I'm asking him questions about a show I enjoy.  Wow, what a dick I am.  Exactly.  Fucking guy.  Exactly.  Damn rich.  So what are you doing bothering him with questions about his own show? 
[03:10:30]  It's just premiering.  Why would you want to talk about that?  On July 17th.  By the way, the 17th, same day Casey Anthony gets out of jail.  And two days before my birthday.  See how ugly it is when we make it about ourselves?  I wanted to know what your birthday was.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Look.  Let's get Aaron out of here.  Let's wrap up before we fuck this up.  Get Aaron out of here.  I want to get the fuck home.  It's Friday.  I'm tired. 
[03:11:00]  We have to finish up with the couch and zilchers.  Yeah, the couch and zilchers.  The Breaking Bad, obviously, I'm annoyed I have not seen more.  It comes on Sunday night.  What time?  It's on at 10 o'clock on AMC.  Right.  Look for Aaron and Brian in that.  It's a fantastic show, man.  Thank you so much.  And pick up the discs and get caught up, you bastards.  Can you get it on iTunes?  Yes!  Of course.  iTunes, Netflix.  Yeah, come back and see us.  Next time you're here, he won't be here.  Yeah, exactly.  Please.  What the fuck?  You didn't want us to interview the guy. 
[03:11:30]  Yeah, you wanted to.  He's not asking questions.  I only got a picture with Amber.  No, no, he's not doing pictures.  Yes!  My stupid iPhone.  I'll take one with a real camera.  Oh, yeah, so I never see him.  I have a whole disc.  I gave you a disc.  No, you didn't.  I did so.  No, you didn't.  Yeah, you know it.  You have some of our pictures.  It's almost over.  The wall was there.  I think it's what I have.  No, it's fine.  I did it the other week, and I laughed at him.  This looks like a fucking.  No, it's really. 
[03:12:00]  This looks like a before and after.  Hey, thank you.  Did you snap one at me and Aaron?  I love it.  I love it.  I normally don't do this.  Jimmy goes, Mr. Picture, I normally don't do this.  Jimmy had an extra good smile on that one.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy, you really went for the smile on that one.  I want to see your handsome picture, Jim.  Yeah.  Jimmy, why the over-the-top smile there?  Oh, with the annoying interrupting guy.  Yeah.  At some point, Voss will watch the show and then be like, oh, that was the guy.  Oh, that was the guy. 
[03:12:30]  I know that fucking show.  And you'll be pointing at a different person.  It's in my top.  Oh, shit.  What?  It's on my wish list.  Is it?  You know what's on mine?  Right.  Let me get it.  Hopefully a plastic surgeon.  I know.  I'm a fucking disaster.  Believe me.  I have no illusions here that I'm a fucking wreck.  I was supposed to do Red Eye last night. 
[03:13:00]  I couldn't even fucking do that.  It kind of would have been funny if I know.  Yeah.  Do they sell swimming helmets?  I think I need one, man.  I'm a disaster.  Who's the last guy on the couch of Zilch's?  Give him a little time.  Well, we didn't talk to the fireman.  We talked to the fireman.  We talked to the fireman.  As Rich calls him.  The fireman.  The buzzard from the Bugs Bunny cartoon.  You haven't talked to him.  The what?  This guy.  We're the best.  Well, that should have been yours.  You're the host.  Thanks, man.  No, no, no.  I got one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Hey, Aaron.  Aaron, Paul, thank you, sir. 
[03:13:30]  Enjoy the rest of your-  Thank you, brother.  The shit that goes around this fucking studio.  This was your best interview of the day.  I just don't know that yet.  Take it easy, man.  All right, let's talk to this guy.  Give him a couple minutes.  He was very cool.  He was very cool.  No, Aaron's very cool.  He was cool, man.  And he's really good on the show.  Yeah.  Really good, man.  He's good on the show, Rich?  That was cool.  Yeah, it's a good show.  It is.  I wish I had seen more than two episodes.  But you don't know the meth is blue?  I don't know.  I do.  We haven't seen it in almost a year and a half.  He might not be up to the part where the meth is blue.  No, we watched our first two seasons.  Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[03:14:00]  Hey.  Well, fuck the shit out of me.  You okay?  We watched Mad Men, Shunter Anarchy.  You watch a lot of stuff?  I didn't like having to share a mic with you when he was in here.  I felt like I was just some...  You can call me your wife.  It was so gross.  Yeah, like you were just...  You know what?  You were just some fucking broad sitting here.  Yes, I just happened to come along.  Yeah.  Where's my pocketbook?  It's like...  Yeah, he's probably looking like, why is he bringing his wife everywhere? 
[03:14:30]  There, she's got to sit at the console.  I just say cock just to let him know.  I'm real, bitch.  Amy Schumer.  Amy Schumer.  Amy Schumer.  Amy Schumer.  Just drop it in, baby.  Just drop it in.  This is like the old Carson shot.  Who's going to come in next?  Baby just walked in.  This is like fucking B-list cameos today.  Amy Schumer.  Oh, my God.  Amy Schumer.  With no makeup, by the way.  Looking great.  Tom told me this morning that I was going to be here at 11, and then he just was like, 
[03:15:00]  how about 10?  I was like, no showering.  He was like, okay.  Oh, I like that.  Wait, Tom.  No pictures.  Who's that guy?  Are you interviewing Amy today?  Yeah.  For your show?  Yeah.  Yeah, who canceled?  Everyone's got a fucking show here.  Come to Papa.  I don't have a show.  I don't have anything.  Come to Papa works because your name is Tom Papa.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  Oh, I get it.  Will you say things like that without the chip voice?  It's very upsetting.  I thought it was, come on, Papa.  Don't think less of me. 
[03:15:30]  How'd you hit your nose in the pool?  I was swimming in it.  It was pretty drunk.  And I was drunk.  It doesn't add up.  It just doesn't add up.  No, it adds up perfectly.  Oh, really?  Too much to drink.  Dude, Schumer without makeup.  Holy shit.  She's still hot.  Yeah.  All right.  Very, very.  Really?  I like it.  Yes.  Don't say that if you don't mean it.  No, I mean it.  She still has her skank appeal.  Skank fun.  What a cunt.  What a cunt.  Thank you, Amy.  It's good to see you.  I didn't know you were still doing comedy.  It's really good to see you.  Oh, shit. 
[03:16:00]  How catchy.  You're doing her.  That's true.  That's true.  Oh, wow.  I didn't know there was an issue between you two.  I don't need you to stick up for me.  I couldn't do that myself.  I found my voice.  And it was Bonnie's.  They don't like each other.  Yeah, go have fun with it.  Do you guys not like each other?  No, we totally love each other.  No, they don't like each other.  Yes, we do.  It's very honest.  I love Bonnie.  No, I can see there's a problem.  Who would?  Do you envy her youth?  Of course.  Do you envy her husband?  I'm 50 years old.  Oh, yeah.  It's really tough.  50 years old.  I'm having... 
[03:16:30]  Is it hot in here or am I having a...  A flash?  Are you having a flash?  Anthony thinks Bonnie's 50 years old.  I did not say that.  We all heard it.  No.  I did not even imply that.  You said to Rich he likes 50.  Rich is 60.  That's what you're seeing.  Oh, is that what it is?  The curve changes.  I just said I don't have 50-year-old women in my house.  They don't like...  Still sounds bad.  And then it was like...  Well, yeah.  That was your rejoin.  You don't have 30-year-old women in your house.  I know. 
[03:17:00]  You don't have 20-year-olds at this point.  Amy Schumer's too old.  That's true.  I'm over the hill for Amy.  We're in 20s.  Hey, I want to ask Schumer.  You were overseas.  Yeah.  Because I follow you on Twitter.  Yeah.  I hung out with...  Yeah.  One of my friends.  Yeah.  I think he's CIA.  We're not sure.  Yeah.  He was like, oh, I do real estate.  But then he had a gun on it.  Now he's saying real estate?  He kept changing his story.  Yeah.  We have a friend that's over there.  Where were you?  Dubai?  Dubai.  Because we can't keep track of him.  Because then he goes to Australia to play hockey.  I'm like, don't you have a job?  And he goes, oh, yeah.  That guy's running from something. 
[03:17:30]  Something's going on.  Something's going on.  Yeah.  But he treated you nice?  Yeah.  We hung out.  We rode a camel together.  We dated while I was there.  He dated a little bit.  You know, we didn't actually make out.  But it was like...  Yeah, we totally hung out.  Did you at least watch him jerk off?  Yeah.  He jerked off on my foot.  Whatever.  In the desert.  I dated.  Doing comedy, right?  A week.  Yeah, you could call it that, I guess.  That's not what they would have called it.  And there were camels involved.  And you were doing camel toes with the regulars.  Yeah.  I follow camel toes.  Thank you for following me. 
[03:18:00]  They were fucking doing camel toes.  What is a camel?  She was doing a camel toe.  Well, we stood next to a camel.  And then we had a camel toe contest.  And I don't know if you think I won.  It's not a big deal.  I think I won.  Did you give yourself a wedgie?  Yeah, I gave myself a...  I pulled my pants up into my vagina to resemble the camel's toe.  Yes, yes.  It's always better to have a little...  I'm an artist.  It's always better, though, if you're going to do a camel toe contest and you know it  advance, build up a little bush.  Sure.  Because that'll puff it up a little.  Nice.  Luckily, I didn't know, but that's exactly what I had.  You just had it anyway. 
[03:18:30]  So, yeah.  That's right.  There's no shaving supplies for women in Dubai.  They don't care about that.  I can't grow hair down there.  It's weird.  It's so weird.  I was born without any.  And it just doesn't grow.  Is that a Canadian?  It must be Canadian.  It's embarrassing.  It's so embarrassing.  I have a teeny, tiny, hairless vagina.  And it is so embarrassing.  That just sounds awful, right?  Yes, it does.  That's why I've had to marry a Jew.  Oh. 
[03:19:00]  Tiny cock.  Oh, boy.  Tiny penis.  Wow.  That's miserable.  Thank God.  Thank God for the Jews.  Yes.  Rich, I'm sorry.  We haven't talked about you in a while.  All right.  How's it been about Rich?  Really?  Army man hat?  Yeah.  What's going on my army?  Yeah.  What do you mean?  Army or something?  Army man hat.  Wow, that's great, Rich.  He's on fire today.  Woo!  I'm on high ofage.  That was pretty good during the year.  Maybe everything else all right with you?  What's that?  Everything else is good?  Oh, I'm just nodding. 
[03:19:30]  I'm like, oh, right, this is on radio.  Yeah, I'm good.  What do you like about Dubai?  I hated it.  It was gross.  Nothing, huh?  No, that place is really fucked up.  Did you go to the Birch Tower?  I looked at it.  I was like, I get it.  It's really tall.  Why'd you win?  Because it was like, what, go to the top of it?  Yeah.  Yeah, why not?  I would.  Because I didn't want to look down on that shithole.  That place is the worst.  Is it really?  It was like, I was left upset because I did a show and some of the local comics were on  and one of them was like, I was like, can I say this joke?  Because they were like, don't talk about religion. 
[03:20:00]  You're not a Jew here, bitch.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, and so this one comic was like, well, I can say this joke, but you can't.  And I was like, why?  And he's like, because I'm Emirati.  And so there's such a caste system there.  The classes are so distinct that some comics can talk about things that others can't.  Oh, fuck that.  It's kind of like here.  It is kind of like here.  You really think so?  How?  Yeah, sure.  Because if a gay comic did gay jokes, it's okay.  But if Tracy does, it means terrible.  If a black comic does black jokes, it's okay.  We're different.  It's just not fair.  A black comic can do any jokes.  Yeah.  Well, that's a day.  Well, because they're yelling, so it doesn't matter. 
[03:20:30]  Yeah, you just got to be like, what?  Yeah, it's like fucking hysterical.  Yeah, but it was like.  Wow, really?  I thought that was gross.  Did you have to wear a burka up there on stage?  I didn't have to.  I chose to.  Yeah, that's funny.  Like, nothing says funny like a burka.  I bought a burkini.  They have like surveillance here.  It's like underarm.  It was.  Did you do well?  Where did you perform?  I did.  It was all like expats.  It wasn't like a lot of Arabs in the crowd.  Where was the show?  It was at the Palladium.  The Palladium.  Yeah.  You've been over there, right?  I was, yeah.  I freaked out texting Tom because they don't allow Ambien in Dubai. 
[03:21:00]  So I've been taking Ambien for almost a year.  So I had to go cold turkey.  What's wrong with this place?  I don't know.  Did you hide that shit?  They don't allow Ambien in Dubai?  That explains what your DVD was selling there, Rich.  I'll explain it on the way home.  You're going to call me from the bus?  Wow, what a zinger.  Ouch. 
[03:21:30]  A bunch of zingers right there.  I've got these two on the marriage ride.  Come on.  Come on, Tom.  What are you waiting for?  Tom, what's the verdict?  What is the verdict, Tom?  Wow, that was brutal.  Tom's off the clock.  That's fucking brutal.  Well, that sounds like a real fucking shithole, man.  I know.  How'd you end up there?  A month ago.  I don't know.  Somebody must have canceled.  Someone booked you there.  They brought me there.  They had a beautiful golf course over there.  Yeah.  They had a big tournament in Dubai.  Golf course.  Yeah.  They're trying to make it happen. 
[03:22:00]  I want to go back to when the guy came on your foot.  Okay.  Okay.  Because I feel bad that's early in your relationship.  I think if you don't let them come on your foot early, then you can never really work it in.  You know?  Might as well let them right out the gate, drop it on my foot.  Once you know each other, you've been sitting on the couch watching some TV, it's kind of  hard to pull that jerk off on the foot and move.  Oh, that's how we do anymore.  Really?  That's all there is to it?  Sometimes I don't even know we're having sex until I look down.  I see a tiny little spot of cum evaporating, huh? 
[03:22:30]  Evaporating.  And rich asleep.  Looks like the teardrop of a fly.  I think we blew up Amy's Twitter.  They're all looking for the camel toe pics.  Oh, shit, man.  Oh, yeah.  Your Twitter's not loading because everyone's there trying to see you with a camel toe.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Check it out, guys.  Nice.  I love it.  You missed the Wire paintball event.  I know.  And then you hung out with guys from The Wire?  I had dinner with Michael the other night.  Who are you?  Omar, are you?  All of a sudden, I'm really interested in you, Jimmy.  He's crazy. 
[03:23:00]  I know.  It's like he's hanging out with the guys from The Wire all the time.  He'd be a stalker.  Did you go over with any other Americans or was it yourself?  Yeah.  Well, there were three nights.  So one of them was Kirk Fox and Tommy Davidson.  Oh, yeah.  We each headline tonight.  I was with Kirk Fox there.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, Kirk Fox is hilarious.  He is funny.  He's a tall drink of scary.  He's a real odd dude.  He was married to Clint Eastwood's daughter at one time.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, a little tidbit of probably false information there. 
[03:23:30]  Exactly.  He was actually a girl he met in Westwood.  He's just...  No, he was married to his daughter.  I played golf with him in L.A.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  He's like a pro tennis player, and he's a good golfer.  I can't believe you're a golfer.  Like, I saw Rich in Montreal.  I didn't know he was like a golf aficionado.  He gets decked out.  Where is he?  Oh, we talked about that.  I was like, what happened?  I was like, are you fighting with Bonnie?  Like, why are you dressed like that?  You're dressed in like fruit-striped gum.  That is crazy.  Those are nice fucking pants. 
[03:24:00]  They really are.  Those are nice.  Those are nice.  Tommy, you know that.  Those are nice pants.  Horrifying.  All right.  So, you headlined...  Like, you had to follow all those other...  Like, I mean, just say no...  Oh, no.  We each headlined a night, but I had to go on...  You had to follow local comics.  Yes.  That kind of knew, you know...  Yeah.  Well, there's the comics of beheadings, and then she goes on.  Yes.  Bring the crowd up.  They show a picture of a clitoris.  Everybody boos.  Oh, shit. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Where are you guest bartending?  In Dubai.  Oh, Lord.  That's fucking hot, man.  Look at his star in David's tattoo.  There's some jerking material tonight.  Oh, yeah.  There's a jerk on...  Oh, what?  He's taking, ladies.  You get to look at that every night, huh?  Oh, I didn't know you played a meth addict.  There's, yeah, Rich Voskic.  I got Tommy Davidson's body.  Tommy Davidson.  That's how he opens his show. 
[03:25:00]  He shows everybody his stomach.  Really?  No, he doesn't.  He does.  I heard him.  What do you say about it?  It's great.  Nothing.  He just stands there and pretends like there's a wind machine in front of him.  It's upsetting.  There's all different kinds of things.  One night and the other two nights you just had to hang out.  You couldn't do guest spots at the local...  I was like, I want to hang out.  I asked for an extra couple of days there before I left because I had seen Dubai and rap videos  and I was like, I can't wait to ride on a tank with Kanye.  And then I was like, oh, my God, can I leave early?  It was...  Bad, huh?  Yeah, but no, we hung out. 
[03:25:30]  How was the hotel?  It was really nice.  It was.  It was really nice.  The guy walked in on me.  The housekeeping guy walked in on me nude.  And then they just...  So what they did was they just brought...  They kept bringing me up food.  To apologize.  Yeah, they're like, okay, we tar naked.  Let's bring her what she likes.  That happened in three days.  I'm surprised they didn't stone you for being naked in your own room.  They were like, what is that, a clit?  We'll take care of that.  Oh, boy.  Let's take that out with a spade shovel.  I'm more impressed by her story than the fucking... 
[03:26:00]  This is fucking great.  Dubai, fucking Amy Schumer, headlining.  This is a fucking story right here.  All right, you're going to cover my foot, aren't you?  Hold on to your feet, ladies.  Yeah, that's why I don't have to look at your face.  Oh, wouldn't she do to deserve that?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  The life of my life every day.  Wow.  Oh, man.  Holy...  Wow.  Do other people have relationships like this?  No.  You know, Sid and Nancy? 
[03:26:30]  Me too.  Fucking OJ and Nicole.  Scott and Lacey.  Yeah.  A frickin' frack or something.  I don't know.  He chips back.  Oh, chips.  But he'll try to, like...  He will try...  Like, say if we're at, like, you know, Walmart or something, and he's getting help from somebody,  he'll trash me like that in front of just a regular person.  It's a stranger, isn't it?  Who I see their face, they're like, should I call someone?  Like, I have to take on the role of, like, abused wife.  Oh, my God. 
[03:27:00]  It's love.  God, you didn't have to play in front of anybody that looked like that.  Yes, I did.  That Yemen president?  I totally did.  Oh, my God, really.  The chicks were wearing the full burqa where you can't even see their eyes.  Oh, it's like a grill?  Yeah.  Wow.  They put that thing over their face.  I'm giving rich ideas.  Yeah.  They do.  You ever see that?  They put something over their face that you can't really see through.  We wish you would.  Yeah.  I know.  Believe me.  It's like Spider-Man eyes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or the neck of the Philly fanatic where the guy's trying to hide in there. 
[03:27:30]  He's like, ah, I know he's not that tall.  Exactly.  Oh, Amy.  So, the guy in the end, where are you from?  Yeah.  Massachusetts.  All right.  We're done.  Massachusetts.  We came down from Massachusetts.  Couch of zilches.  Damn.  Wow.  I didn't want to interrupt the Dubai and camel toe stories.  No.  Why would you?  That's fair.  What part of Massachusetts?  Pretty close to Worcester.  Oh, what do you do at Worcester?  I'm an engineer.  Cool.  Computer chip.  Obviously not a good one.  Computer chip design. 
[03:28:00]  Chip got excited when he heard chips.  What?  What's that?  What's that?  Someone call me?  Yeah.  And did we get to, what does the other guy do there?  That's the fireman.  The fireman.  The fireman, right.  What does Rich would say?  He drives a big, shiny, red truck.  Fireman.  I do, right here in Manhattan.  Ah, yes.  Which company, brother?  Ladder 7.  29th Street.  Oh, Ladder 7.  Yes.  Yes.  And Opie, you actually blocked me on Twitter last week.  Oh, shit. 
[03:28:30]  I bet you deserved it.  What happened?  Why did you say it?  I just, I said that Bobo wasn't funny.  Oh, boy.  I'm going to block you from life.  What is wrong with you?  Are you a hater?  Yeah.  Why do you got to hate?  No, no.  Not hating at all.  Opie blocks anyone that says the truth.  Because Bobo is not funny.  No, what I...  I don't know.  I just felt he ran his course.  He wasn't funny.  Oh, you're really stupid.  I'm sorry.  Oh, damn.  Oh, damn.  He's blocking you again.  He takes it.  I was doing a bit.  Anyone that mentioned Bobo got blocked. 
[03:29:00]  I didn't block anyone.  What?  Oh.  You never got blocked.  Oh, shit.  It's Henson here.  He would know if you tweeted because you do it every two seconds.  He would know.  Exactly.  He can't fucking get one of your fucking 400-a-day tweets.  All right.  Thanks.  Sorry, Opie.  Superdeluxe.com was that website I talked about.  Exactly.  Now we got all the answers today.  Finally.  Look, he runs into fires.  Just cut him some slack.  Jesus.  I wouldn't block a fucking fire dude.  Thanks.  Yeah.  I don't think... 
[03:29:30]  Fire dude.  Fire dude.  Instead of fire men.  That's what they're called now.  Fire dudes, dude.  If you weren't married, we could probably go to dinner.  No.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'd be a fun guy to go out with.  No.  I'm a fun date.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't see it.  I don't either.  Goddamn, Amy.  I have to watch all your super deluxe clips.  That's what I thought of when I was laying in bed one night. 
[03:30:00]  She does these impressions.  I'm really good at it.  I think it was the real people.  Hold on.  I might have something here.  What's up?  My husband might let me go out with you anyway.  Oh, really?  Is he good like that?  Mm-hmm.  Is he a big fan?  Mm-hmm.  Is he a cuckold?  Oh, my God.  No.  Jesus.  Riches.  I used that word in front of Rich one time, and he's like, nobody's ever heard of that 
[03:30:30]  word.  Cuckold.  Everybody knows what a cuckold is.  Yes.  He doesn't know.  I've explained it to him.  Yeah.  It's when you're fucking a girl, and she tells you how she'd rather be fucking somebody else,  and you pretend to get mad, then you cum a lot.  Tell me about other people so I can get hard.  Oh, my God.  Well, that's good.  The husband would be okay with Jimmy taking her out.  Where would we go?  You could be in different rooms, and your husband could still come on your feet. 
[03:31:00]  It's true.  Because they're giant.  Can you please leave her alone?  If she wants to come up here wearing flippers, there's nothing wrong with that.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Wait, let's see what else the husband's okay with.  Yeah, what else is the husband's okay with?  Yeah, dinner's okay.  What else would he be okay with?  Be honest.  A hug.  Compound party.  See?  I'm too old.  I'm way too old.  No, no, no, no.  Believe me, you're not.  What are you, 27?  Believe me, you're not.  Yeah, really close to that.  A little younger than that. 
[03:31:30]  Would he be mad if Norton trapped you?  I have a very bad reputation about the age of girls that are allowed over to the compound,  and believe me, you fit right in.  Don't you worry about it.  Is this your second husband?  How'd you know that?  Because you said you were older than 27.  And you seem broken.  Yes.  Fuck it, Amy.  I'm surprised you're older than 27. 
[03:32:00]  You looked younger.  So, how long did you marry your first husband?  Young, 25.  25?  Okay, and how long did you marry him for?  Not very long.  Okay, so...  I'm not 27, but Bonnie said a real lady doesn't tell her age.  Okay, that doesn't matter.  You look good.  I don't know how I heard that.  I don't know.  It's Laverne and Shirley.  Oh, okay.  Is that how he proposed to you?  Did he slide it in, saying I went from rags to riches?  Say, thank you.  Carmine Ragusa.  I'll do him all day. 
[03:32:30]  I'll do him until the room empties.  So, uh...  It won't take long.  I know.  The room is going to be...  So, you wanted to marry this guy, or was it kind of just getting a crunch time?  No, no crunch time.  Oh, you really love him?  Mm-hmm.  He's a good guy.  Is he?  As a friend, or as...  Ew.  Is he the big dick?  Yes.  Oh, cool.  Now Norton loves him. 
[03:33:00]  You have any kids?  Huh?  Nah, good.  There we go.  That's okay.  See?  That cuts the age down right there.  Sorry, Bonnie, I'm not talking about you again.  I'm just saying, if you're a certain age, and you don't have kids, it's just as good  or better than a girl of younger age that has kids.  So would you be able to come to a compound party?  I have a whole formula.  Yeah.  Worked out.  She works.  But he'd probably want to come. 
[03:33:30]  And she's 15 with him.  Here, let me go.  Oh.  Would he really?  Well, consider yourself...  Now, I know I shouldn't be inviting people to Aunt's house.  Oh, anybody's invited to my house.  I should go to the compound party at your place this week.  I don't have a pool, though.  We can just frolic in the tub.  In the tub.  I was going to say something that I refrained.  You could come to the compound.  Yes, absolutely.  And if you're nice, and you have a good time, then the next time you can bring your husband.  Okay.  That sounds like a plan.  There you go. 
[03:34:00]  Wow.  Jimmy, you're smooth.  Set it up through Jim.  I can jump on the LA.  Jim has all the information.  What's that?  I can jump on the LA.  I'm local.  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Those feet, you can jump anywhere.  Wow.  It's Uncle Vinny's.  It's so good.  Holy shit.  Uncle Vinny's all week.  I'm sorry.  Sam, I apologize.  I found myself up for that.  I'm trying to talk to Frogger.  I like her feet. 
[03:34:30]  I'm going to wear sneakers.  No, don't leave them like that.  They're sexy.  No, no, no.  They're great.  They're great.  I like those.  They're perfectly proportioned.  I wouldn't worry about it.  It smells like someone farted again.  Again, right?  Damn it.  I think it's Bonnie.  Is it you?  No.  Oh, God.  Lord.  Wow.  Ever since I started menopause, I can't.  Menopause.  Did the farts make it over there? 
[03:35:00]  No, they didn't.  All right.  Coming from there.  It was me both times.  What were you pushing out today, Jimmy?  What's that?  Were you pushing out fear today?  No, I was pushing because I love Samantha, so all the hate was coming out of me.  So I can fill up with love.  Nothing but love.  How come love smells the same coming out of you?  Everything.  Love, hate, any emotion.  It smells like shit.  Yes, it smells like shit.  All right.  Let's get the fuck out. 
[03:35:30]  Start our weekend.  Very good.  We were two days this week.  We didn't pick a chair of honor person, but it was kind of...  It was Amy Schumer.  Amy Schumer.  Chair of honor.  Amy.  Thank you so much.  Came from some savage country.  No makeup looking hot as fuck and funny as...  Wearing her pajamas.  I like that.  Very good.  Wearing her little PJs.  You got like a tan, too.  What's going on?  Dubai tan.  Nice.  That's good.  I like it.  Thank you.  I'm a big fan of the Schumer.  Thanks.  Yeah. 
[03:36:00]  Thanks to Eric, right?  Yes, sir.  And Sam and...  Brian.  Brian.  Who I didn't block.  The couch of zilches.  Another successful couch of zilches.  Yes.  Unfortunately, we didn't really have a lot of time to work with you.  I'm staying in New York.  What are you going to do?  Go see the Yankees?  No, I don't know.  Did that guy get his three hits last night?  He got one.  What do you mean that guy?  He needs two more.  Two more.  Virginia needs two more.  Two more.  That guy get his hits.  That guy get his hits.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Tom Papa.  Thank you, sir.  Maritreff. 
[03:36:30]  Good to see you guys.  Sunday nights at 10 o'clock.  Tom Papa on Twitter.  Come to Papa on fucking SiriusXM, right?  Yep.  Making in the tens of dollars for that one, are you?  Oh, yeah.  I like doing things for free.  Yeah.  Why not?  Bonnie McFarlane at Magoobies.  Magoobies.  In Baltimore next weekend.  Next Friday and Saturday.  Magoobies.  And it was supposed to be a secret.  Magoobies.  I'll be at Magoobies.  I'll be at Magoobies.  Come on my foot. 
[03:37:00]  It was supposed to be a secret, but sometime next week, there'll be a special guest host  of the after show.  Oh.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  That sounds very difficult.  Not much of a secret at all.  Wow.  Well, sounds like Robert Kelly's coming in.  Wow.  You know what, dude?  Boom.  I just try to do what I do.  You know what, dude?  I didn't appreciate Tom Papa saying shit about me.  Yeah.  What the fuck, dude?  I'm not even there.  I'm in Ottawa. 
[03:37:30]  Bobby.  Uncle Vinny's tonight, tomorrow.  Oh, yeah.  Richard.  We got that in.  Yeah, we got that in.  Amy, any plugs?  Where are you going to be?  The Palms.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Oh, I'll be at Pittsburgh.  Where is that place?  My first door deal at some point.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, can somebody come to the show at Pittsburgh?  Yes.  Improv, please?  One person at least.  Just one guy, please.  There'll be some guy at the door that just goes, click.  Yeah.  We got it.  That's all you hear all night.  We got it.  I get part of his cover.  A table up front, sir.  A table up front. 
[03:38:00]  All right, chop, chop.  We're done.  Yes!  Yay!  She's working for a...  Thank you, guys.  Have a spot.  Wait, I got to go on.  She's working for a door or something.
