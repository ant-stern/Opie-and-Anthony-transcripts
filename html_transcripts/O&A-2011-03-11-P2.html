<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony "After O&A Live" show, hosted by Sam Roberts, was a whirlwind of bizarre segments and celebrity appearances.  The broadcast began with a discussion of comedian Gallagher's health struggles, including a near-death experience from a heart attack, and touched upon past controversies surrounding accusations of racism against him.  This transitioned into DJ Who Kid's recounting of his encounters with Star Jones, filled with humorous anecdotes (including a memorable “moisture” incident) and juicy gossip regarding her relationship status and other celebrities.

Next, the show played and discussed a surprisingly popular D-Boy dance remix of children's earthquake warning videos from YouTube.  This was followed by extensive coverage of Roland's massive pizza party, a legendary event attended by numerous celebrities, including Kid Kelly and Kevin from Project Runway.  The party was so large it spilled into other offices, disrupting work, and rumors of a “condom pizza” circulated.  Joe DeRosa, a guest earlier in the day, then shared his scathing account of a disastrous Donald Trump roast, highlighting the poor performance of the featured comedian.

The show then marked the third anniversary of showcasing clips from the TV show *Quincy*, playing several segments rife with incredibly bad acting, writing, and offensive language, including numerous anti-Semitic remarks and jokes. The hosts' reactions primarily focused on the comedic value of the show's awfulness.  Interspersed throughout the show were updates on a near-miss accident in the studio, involving a large wall nearly collapsing,  a detail reluctantly shared via a note from Fez. The ongoing Japan/Hawaii tsunami was cited as a reason for curtailing several segments.

The broadcast featured a large number of SiriusXM personalities in studio, including Roland, Mars, E-Rock, Troy, Danny, Travis, D-Boy, Reef (Roland's boss), DJ Who Kid, Liam (talent booker), Steve Leeds (head of talent), Ron Bennington, and Mark Zito.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Let me try that again.  Anthony. Anthony. Say it, Sam.  Anthony, After Opie and Anthony Live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  Opie and Anthony have, of course, their weekend started,  I mean, the minute that you heard them say goodbye is when their weekend started. 
[00:00:30]  But the rest of us are still here.  Roland, Mars, E-Rock, Troy, Danny, Travis, D-Boy, we're all still here keeping the channel live.  Today on the show was a little bit of a weird show because a major news story started off.  They had to talk about the tsunami that was going on in Japan and I guess Hawaii now, too.  But because of that, a lot of stuff that we wanted to get to wasn't able to be gotten to.  But fear not, we will give you full coverage of the pizza party. 
[00:01:00]  Roland's giant pizza party, broken here on After Opie and Anthony Live, by the way,  right here today on the show.  Also on O&A this morning, they said they put out the breaking news that Gallagher had collapsed on stage.  Now, as odd as it sounds, for those of you that didn't know this, Gallagher, of all people, is a friend of the show.  Although he hasn't been on the show since he was accused of racism.  But he is a friend of the show. 
[00:01:30]  And he was actually on a few years ago talking about how bad his heart was.  This is Gallagher on our show just a couple years ago talking about how near death he believes that he is.  After O&A Live.  Hold on, Gallagher.  I want to talk about your heart, smoking, pot, stress, and the fact that you're going to die in two years.  I've already done it.  This is all the stuff he said while you were gone smoking there, Bobby.  He's going to die?  Yeah, he's going to die in two years. 
[00:02:00]  What are you going to leave me?  Why two years?  Why is it two years that you're going to die?  Well, 63, I did in 65.  Probably just about the time I qualified to get some money from the government.  Win that figure, right?  But you've got energy.  It doesn't look like you're going anywhere anytime soon.  I know, but you can't tell with plumbing.  You never know when it's clogged.  I didn't know I was having a heart attack when I had it.  I thought I had indigestion.  I was watching the Lakers.  It was a Sunday.  They were in the playoffs.  I had my two kids over, my son and my daughter. 
[00:02:30]  So I didn't go in until the next day.  And by then, I had a 20% damage to my heart.  So when you look at my heart, 20% of it doesn't get blood and is kind of rotting.  And then after a while, that thins because it goes into your bloodstream.  And so then my heart will start to expand because it'll be pumping, but it'll have a thin wall there.  You know, you have to become a doctor when you get sick, just like you become a lawyer when you get arrested. 
[00:03:00]  Because if you don't know, everywhere you leak, the world hangs a bucket.  That's what I'm telling you.  You've got to know about this shit, because otherwise, how can you hire people?  That's fucking brilliant.  And you're smoking again, which is good.  Well, I can't always find dope.  D-Boy was just walking around here.  It's after Opie and Anthony live.  I'm Sam Roberts.  D-Boy was just walking around here.  It looks like he's trying to get a look at Star Jones.  Is Star Jones still in the building?  Yeah, she's walking around doing something. 
[00:03:30]  Good Lord.  Roland.  Roland's in here whispering jokes off mic.  That's not good, Roland.  DJ Who Kid.  Roland, go grab DJ Who Kid.  He's right outside.  Let's see if he wants to come in for a second.  Just see if he wants to come in live.  DJ Who Kid is walking around.  I guess he just talked to Star Jones.  E-Rock's talking to him.  Come on.  I don't have to book you.  I've been on your show.  Who Kid.  You're on.  We're on the air right now.  Hey, serious? 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  What happened?  We're live.  They go home at 10 o'clock.  Oh, for real?  Yeah.  We can take over.  You take over like that?  Yeah, they're out of here at 10 o'clock.  They said do what you want.  Get out of here.  What difference does it make?  Are you serious?  You want to do an hour next week?  Get out of here.  Where's my headphones at, yo?  You're on.  I'm just going to take over real quick then.  You were just talking to Star Jones.  She didn't want to do our show.  For real?  Why?  What happened?  I mean, there's a lot of celebrities that don't want to do Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony is like the hottest show.  I thought so.  Millions of like, you know, we do have millions of listeners, but we just don't have a good 
[00:04:30]  reputation.  What are you going to do to her?  Celebrities like to be kept safe.  Like they know like who kid is going to give them a nice comfortable interview.  Like you take your shots.  I mean, yeah.  But then you kind of laugh.  You make them laugh with you.  I gave her moisture.  You did?  Yeah.  A lot of moisture.  Wow.  Star Jones?  Wow.  She's a fan.  What was she in here?  Talking about Celebrity Apprentice?  Yeah, she thought I was a young Denzel Washington.  She did?  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Is this true?  It's a lot of cougarism.  And you got it on video and everything?  Yeah, video, everything.  Moisture is on me.  I felt so Christian.  Every time you talk to, it could be Star Jones or anyone.  Anytime you talk to a female, there's a very sexual vibe in the room.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, you got to keep the moisture out there, yeah.  I've seen, you know, you're posting pictures with you and JWoww, Olivia Munn, now Star Jones  too.  Isn't she still married to that guy or no?  I think they're still dating.  I think they're still dating, right?  Oh, I don't know.  Who cares?  Everybody cheats now. 
[00:05:30]  Like, who cares?  What difference does it make, right?  Yeah, I don't know.  Jesus Christ.  And then later on, I'm going to be with J-Lo.  Jennifer Lopez?  Yeah.  In here?  We're going to be filming her and she's selling a new G-string.  She's selling a G-string?  Yeah, it's only going to be sold in the Bronx and parts of Brooklyn.  I don't know why.  How do you get, how do you get all these people, like, all the A-listers don't mind  going to Who Kid, but they don't want to risk being on Opie and Anthony.  I just don't understand.  What's the big deal? 
[00:06:00]  This is a great show.  I hear it all the time.  I laugh.  You guys make me feel.  Well, you know what?  It's like when you came on Opie and Anthony, you thought it was just going to be a fun time  that all of a sudden there's 150,000 people on YouTube watching you saying that Eminem  pissed on Nick Cannon or whatever you said.  On Nick Cannon?  Why are you scared of me?  She's actually having twins.  Do you think it's really Nick Cannon's?  I mean, I don't have any reason to think otherwise, but do you think?  You're more in that community. 
[00:06:30]  I mean, Eminem didn't say.  It could be Eminem's is what you're saying.  I'm not afraid.  You just made another YouTube video, by the way.  This is after the tsunami.  You heard about the tsunami, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  It's really bad.  It's horrible.  There's a kid on YouTube that we love who does earthquake warnings.  Oh, get out of here.  Except he just warns people of earthquakes.  He's not a meteorologist.  He doesn't know when earthquakes are coming.  And so we put his YouTube clips to a beat. 
[00:07:00]  Our producer did, D-Boy.  What?  And made like a dance mix.  Why don't you listen to this?  This is D-Boy's production.  We played this on the show today.

[00:11:00]  After One Live  Hey, we got something that's been making its way around one of the fan sites  I don't know which one I would give you credit  But the Quincy clip  Oh  See, Jimmy does Jim C, obviously  Jim C  Which is based on Quincy, obviously  Loosely based on the Quincy character's Jim C  Which is exactly like Quincy  There have been similarities  People have pointed out  Yeah  No fingerprint expert  He has certain weird clipped words 
[00:11:30]  Expert  Clips  And now  Clip  I guess the next stage of this bit  People are finding Quincy clips that they think are ridiculous or funny or whatever  And it's not supposed to be funny because it was a drama  It was a drama  No one really realizes that this show  It's phrasing  It had credibility  It was a serious show  And it was on the heels of The Odd Couple  It was after he had left The Odd Couple as Oscar Madison  So it was kind of odd to see him in a drama  There were some comedic moments and comedy elements throughout the thing 
[00:12:00]  But basically it was supposed to be like a serious show  Right  And at the time, I don't know how, but it was  Now, you listen back and it's like, this is horrible  This stinks  And when Quincy would talk, he would take his thumb  And he would take the other four fingers  Picture going, mama me  Right, right  The way you do your fingers from a mummy  That's how he would talk  Like, uh, he would  Even when he was just talking, uh, casually  He's a harder guy to do when he's not angry 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, yeah  But he's always wearing a dick sweater  Or some fucking Iranian president members only jacket  And then, is this the punk rock clip?  Yeah  He wants to talk to a bunch of punk rockers  This stinks  It's almost a parody of a show that stinks  Oh, yeah  It's so bad  It's so completely bad  He's in a punk rock bar  You want to play the first clip even though it's slightly long?  I mean, the punk rock clips are the big get here  But the first clip's funny  Because the, the, the, the, uh, over-the-top caring is like 
[00:13:00]  Why would you care about the answers?  Oh, right  It's the one we listened to earlier  Yeah, yeah  Yeah, I got you  Well, let's start with this clip from Quincy way back in the day  And then we'll get to the punk, uh, the punk club  The punk clips  I can blow them up even bigger if you want, Quincy  Oh, thanks, uh, you can blow them up the size of an elevator  We still wouldn't get a clear print out of it  Clear print  Clear print  This isn't my day  It's not your day  What problems are you having?  Those overlapping prints we found on the end  That was some of Steve's acting right there  Not your day  That was his fucking awful boss 
[00:13:30]  John Astin, his real name was, I think?  I don't know  Was it?  That fucking dumb mustache  What was his name?  How'd your parents die?  Yeah  I don't know  We haven't done an autopsy  You can blow it up as big as an elephant  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking house  I'm not gonna get a clear print  Print  Clear print  Yeah, listen to the Steve actor by the other guy  This isn't my day  It's not your day  What problems are you having?  I'm blowing up your fist  We found on the ice cream  These?  Yeah  Well, what about them?  Well, we blow them up 
[00:14:00]  Hoping to squeeze some more information out of them  But no such luck  You know, Quincy  Maybe there is a way to unscramble these prints  Yeah, it's like trying to put the toothpaste back into the tube  There isn't a fingerprint man alive  Who'll get a positive ID based on what's here  Not a man, but a machine, maybe  Machine?  Hey, visions of buying one until I looked at the price  Remember that computer show I went to in May?  At the convention center?  Yeah  Who cares where it was?  At the convention center?  No, no, the arena  You sure?  Because I remember the one at the convention center  Right 
[00:14:30]  Who cares where it was?  A computer show at the convention center  Where do they have one computer?  Yeah, one computer  See, because they were real large back then  That's my large computer joke  It was so bad  The information they were giving  It was too pricey  Back in May  Yeah  Who gives a fuck?  Just a machine  Machine  What, a computer?  A machine?  I was going to get one  But it was a little too pricey  Oh, you were Jew  So because it was too pricey  There's like dozens of murders  They're not going to solve 
[00:15:00]  Yeah  Too pricey  Too pricey  I'll try to do it the old fashioned way  And save a few bucks  We would have fingerprints, Sam  But the boss is a jerk  That's right  This guy never saw a penny  That he didn't like  We can't get a clear print  A clear print  I bet we could get clear prints  Off a penny from your pocket  A pocket  You're a Jew  Quince is an anti-Semite  There's six million of them, Sam  And they're hiding somewhere 
[00:15:30]  Bobby Fisher was right  The whole thing was a lie  They were never murdered  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas  What's my problem?  You're in my fucking crime lab  You're in my  Quincey  My  My  My  This plot was murdered  Here, let's go back to this clip  Went to in May  At the convention center? 
[00:16:00]  Yeah  Quincey  They had a graphics computer  That could take two combined pictures  And separate the images  No  Do you remember who was displaying it?  But I was too cheap to buy it  Too cheap  Oy vey, Quince  Right  Do you remember who was displaying it?  Come tell  Maybe I'll just give them a call  Pick up some modern computer equipment there  Help Quincy out  It could actually separate two sets of fingerprints 
[00:16:30]  And play pong at the same time  Yeah  That's awful  So then Quincy, in this particular episode  He goes to a punk rock club  Yeah  And he convinces the punk rock club manager  To let him go on stage and talk to the youth  He wanted to talk to the kids  But do you have  It is the part where he's trying to convince them  If I could just convince them  And the fuck  He's wearing this shit dick sweater 
[00:17:00]  Yeah  And the manager stinks  Go ahead  It's so bad  Good luck  If you want to  Good luck with that  And the punk rock kids are  Not kids, first of all  Right out of central casting  As they like to say  Just awful  The dialogue  Hey man  Right  They're just really not convincing  They look like they have Halloween costumes on  Yeah, it looks like now  How you would Halloween dress as a punk  Right, of course  Well, they can't have real punk rockers on TV 
[00:17:30]  That would scare the shit out of everybody  It was wholesome TV back then  So this is the edgiest they could get  If they have a punk rock character  But look at how fucking fast the music shuts down  They're all quiet  Listen, there's nothing not awful about this  It's amazing how they took awfulness  And they just stretched it over a bunch of moments  And wasn't punk rock all about  Fuck the establishment  Yeah  Establishment  And as soon as Quincy walks on  Obviously, like, he's the establishment  Oh, the music shuts down 
[00:18:00]  Everyone is quiet immediately  They'd be like, what the fuck?  Wouldn't you just start throwing chairs at the man?  I wish it was a Gigi Allen show  Right  You could shit in Quincy's face  Fucking shit out of banana  He just shoved up his ass into Quincy's mouth  Him and his brother Merle  We'll have homosexual relations, Sam  He's pissing on the crowd  Gigi  A Gigi Allen show  Fucking Gigi  I want to talk to the murder junkies  The murder junkies  The murder junkies

[00:26:00]  And unrealistic?  We just didn't know  Any better, man  It was that  Sick society  Listen  It just seems like  Something like  We should have looked  And gone  I don't think  A coroner does this  After ONA  Live  That was  Three years ago  Today  The Quincy clips  First came on  The Opie and Anthony  Show  This is after  Opie and Anthony  Live  And I'm Sam Roberts  Opie and Anthony  I mean by this time  It's 43 after the hour  So you know that 
[00:26:30]  Opie and Anthony  Took off a long time ago  But  The rest of us  Are still here  The whole ONA crew  Rolling  You're still here  Yes  Ron and Fez guys  Are running around  Everybody's in a panic  Mark Zito's here too  Yeah, Mark Zito's over there  Everybody rolling  And you  Like we said  Anytime there's a guest  In here  Whether it's your guest  Or not  You still get your nerves  Going  Because Michelle Rodriguez  Today's  Today's the big  Michelle Rodriguez thing  Yes, yes  For the other show  How come  What?  For an Fez  I didn't know that  How come  ONA didn't get 
[00:27:00]  Michelle Rodriguez  Because unfortunately  She had other  Prior stuff to do  Before  She could come here  At 10 o'clock  Oh, she wasn't coming  Until late  At 10  So you know  What happens at 10 o'clock  Yeah, ONA  Are at the door  I mean, you could have  Booked her on after  ONA  But I guess  She's never heard  Of this show  Has she?  She has  Really?  Yes  Not really  Oh, man  Well, we had  Joe DeRosa on today  As you know  And he was talking  About being at  The Trump Roast  Where apparently  The situation  Bombed  So before he left 
[00:27:30]  He talked about it  A little on the show  I figured  I talked to him  In the hallway  As he was trying  To leave  About his experience  At the Trump Roast  It airs on Tuesday  So we're going  A little inside  With this  Joe, so you get  To go to the Trump Roast  And you saw  The situation bomb  Yeah  What happened?  What happened was  And this really  Is the biggest problem  Is that  His dad  Fucked his mom  And made him  And that's where 
[00:28:00]  It all started  Yeah, yeah  And then he was  Let loose on the world  And then that eventually  Series of events  Led to him  Performing on the  Donald Trump Roast  And that's what happened  So, like  As a comic  When you see  That he's up there  Does it make you mad  And then when you  Watch him bomb  Does it make you  Kind of happy again?  You know, no, dude  It's  It didn't  It didn't make me mad  That he was there  You know, there was  No part of me  That was like  I'm a comic  I should be  There was nothing  Like that about me 
[00:28:30]  I was annoyed  That you're just like  Why is there  Being another thing  To validate this guy  Right now  You know what I mean?  He doesn't need  Any more validation  Then I was a little excited  Hoping that he'd bomb  But then when he bombed  I couldn't even enjoy it  Because I knew it didn't  The fucking humiliation  Didn't penetrate  His thick  Stupid fucking skull  You know what I mean?  Like he's just so  Not aware  He literally said  At one point  He goes  Ah, man  I suck at comedy tonight  Tonight?  Yeah, yeah  I'm having an off night 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, because that guy  Is like one of those guys  That would be like  Whatever, guys  I'm hilarious  With my friends  And I got money  He really thinks like that  Like, I got money  In the bank  You know?  He kept saying  Like to Trump  He kept being like  Hey, Don, man  You know  At least we got  A few million  You know  Like  Yeah, like  Trying to relate  To Donald Trump  Like  He sucks, man  He just  He's the worst, dude  They're all the worst  They suck  Have you had a bunch  Of them in here?  Yeah, we had him  We had JWoww  And we had Vinny in here 
[00:29:30]  JWoww?  I never really watched the show  I saw it once  And it was  I love how Italian people  Protested the Sopranos  Yet nobody's pissing  At money about the Jersey Shore  It's fucking done  Done more damage  To Italian people  Than Ellis Island  It's ridiculous  That makes sense, right?  Yeah  That's a good reference  Okay, good  Joe DeRosa on  After Opie and Anthony Live  I can't wait  I hope they leave the situation  On that roast  But we had such a busy show today 
[00:30:00]  Especially  Covering all the tsunami stuff  That horrible  Horrible stuff  That happened over there  In Japan and Hawaii  Water and stuff  Roland, your pizza party  Ended up getting bumped  Off O&A  They didn't get  They just didn't have time  For it today  I know  Are you disappointed by that?  Because you put a lot of effort  Into throwing this pizza party  For no reason  No, my heart and prayers  Are out to the people  In the tsunami areas  But would you have liked  Some coverage on the  You know, on the main show?  No, because I know  The tsunami is very important 
[00:30:30]  It's a tragedy  I see in there  Liam's in there  The talent booker  Liam  E-Rock, ask Liam  What he thought of the pizza party  Hang on one second  Liam  Yeah  Thoughts on the pizza party  Oh, it was amazing  That cake  Wow  I mean  Cake  Every type of cookie  That you could ever  Ever imagine  Pizzas  I mean, yeah  You had a cake  From Amy's bread  Delicious  You had cookies  Celebrities  Celebrities were there  From Project Runway  I didn't know why  They were there  Yeah, but  Roland, I mean 
[00:31:00]  I didn't even really know  How to cover this  Yes  So I kind of just  Went in there with a mic  And tried to record  Some of what was going on  At the party  It took a little while  To start up  You gotta admit that  But once it got started  It was banging  Yeah, because  The means were moved around  Suspicious  What do you mean?  Oh, I don't know  Oh, you mean  There were people in meetings  That were supposed to be  At the party  And the meeting got moved  Earlier  The times moved  For different meetings  Well, who would have a bone  To pick with you like that?  I don't know  Who scheduled those meetings? 
[00:31:30]  I don't know  Oh  I see  Roland's making faces at me  Because he's not  He doesn't like my  Direct line of questioning  Here's  So we'll go  We'll play some clips  From this pizza party  This is kind of  When the guests  First started rolling in  I mean, I didn't think  That all these people  Were going to show up  There were people's bosses  At this party  You mean both  So here's  Here's  Clip one  From the guests  Rolling into  Roland's pizza party  Listen to that music 
[00:32:00]  I mean, just  Here's what you  Listen to this all in context  Because this is all going on  In a small office  That is among  Many offices here  Everybody's just  Trying to do work  Not everybody  Had heard about this  No  So all of a sudden  Club music is blasting  Out of one office  DJ Troy Kwan  Who brought it  MVP  MVP  And this is  Kid Kelly  We start with  Kid Kelly  Who runs  Hits One  And all of pop music  Here on Sirius XM  Walking in  To the pizza party  Kid Kelly in the house 
[00:32:30]  Yeah  Kid Kelly  What brings you  To Roland's pizza party  I heard that  Roland was here  And there was pizza  Yeah  Yeah  Roland  Oh thank you  Do you know Roland  I know him now  And I'm not going to eat  I'm just here for the  Camarader  I'm here for the music  Kid didn't know you  Before this  I don't think  I just met him briefly  I think he knew who you were  Roland 
[00:33:00]  What a party this is turning into  You're sweating like a machine  I always sweat  But I hope Liam and Spencer  Make it down quick  Because the pizzas are going  Who are the females that are here?  I don't know  Who's Liam?  I'm upstairs  But I couldn't snuck by this place  See this is Liam's intern  And there were girls there  You can tell  There's like 30 people  Crammed into your tiny office  At one point  Yeah  It was extremely hot  At one point  It smelled really good  Roland  You got a lot of party crashers 
[00:33:30]  That's okay  It's a party  But that's expected  Yeah  Whoa  The talent department  The talent department  Liam your intern showed up  Like 20 minutes before you  I'm sure she did  Yeah  I'm not that surprised  Yeah  Maximum capacity  Are we?  Is Rob Cross monitoring this?  Yeah  I'm not my fire marshal  No  So Rob Cross was there too  I think there's something  Like shaking a little  Like a little dancing  For a moment  Shaking a little?  Like a little  His dance moves  Well I mean did you think 
[00:34:00]  That you were nervous  That you know  Management might not like this  I was a little bit  Once they started coming in  And I see it's just pizza  And a lot of food  And fun  And music  Did anybody that you thought  Was going to come to this  Pizza party yesterday  Not come?  No  Everybody showed up  Everybody that you wanted  To show up  Everybody was invited  I see  We'll play one more clip  Because I wanted to play more  But we're going to run out of time  I also wanted to play  Ron and Fez  Ended up covering this pizza party  As well  If you listen to them live 
[00:34:30]  Ron and Pepper both left Fez  And brought the Blackberry  Down into the office  And broadcast this pizza party live  It was hilarious to listen to  And I pulled the clip to play  But we're not going to have time  To play it today  Because there was just  So much stuff going on  But here is  First  Kevin from Project Runway  Was there  And he told me  That he thought he was booked  For O&A  And then Steve Leeds comes in  Who is the head of talent here  Well Kevin for Project Runway 
[00:35:00]  Thought he was going to be on  Opie and Anthony today  Oh that's unfortunate  He was on after  And he was on the show  Four years ago  Hey Fez is here  Fez is here  Fez is here  Fez is here  Fez is here  Fez is here  Fez is here  I'm here for the party  Alright now we know  What the booking staff is doing  They're all in here  Look Steve Leeds is behind you 
[00:35:30]  Steve Leeds  I'm telling you  This is a place to be  To see and be seen  Ron Bennington just walked in  We were just saying  That you were there  I wanted to play the clip  From your show yesterday  We're running out of time  It's ten minutes long  Sure  You can't cover this  From every angle  There's a tsunami  You know  But you got to experience  What a party this was  I was there for the heat  I was there for the excitement  And big talk already going on  About the taco batch  And I can't wait for it  Tacos 
[00:36:00]  I mean it's going to be like  Mexican sombreros  It's going to be great  Roland you said  I said  You know  You said I'm competing here  For the best party  I let you know  Nobody else is throwing a party  And you said you're going to  Compete against yourself  That's correct  When is the next Roland party?  There'll be either a food truck  Or a barbecue party soon  Now let me ask you this  Have you thought about deli  That we really do this  Old style Jew one day  Just really old style deli  We could do that too 
[00:36:30]  Is there any talk about karaoke  Going down?  Roland?  It's your party  That'll be Anthony's expertise  That's true  And any way that  Ron and Fez can do  A live remote from it  Would be really great  If we could really talk  To engineering  About setting something up  Well I don't know  What happened  I don't know what happened  On Ron and Fez yesterday  But we walked in  And our wall had fallen down  And Opie hasn't read it yet  I don't think  But I saw Fez earlier  And he wanted me to make sure  That Opie read this  Page and a half note  That he wrote to him 
[00:37:00]  Fez footnotes  Everything in life  What he doesn't say himself  Is all happening in his brain  So if there's a chance  To type it out  There's not many short notes  So he left him a note  About this weirdness  Coming down  Yeah  I read some of it  And it seemed like  It was like crazy  Like it had been  Like a near death experience  And you know  Like a letter of complaint  And that he had  Really been put at risk  Because the big Opie and Anthony 
[00:37:30]  Wall that they put up  Fell down  So Opie doesn't  Want to read it  For legal purposes  I've never touched that  Your Honor  I have no idea  What that says  It went directly to my lawyer  Well I'm sure  Hopefully Fez will  Maybe get into this  A little later  On the Ron and Fez show  We gotta wrap up  And give the studio  To you guys  Well  The masterminds  Didn't put glue  No  They had it Velcroed up there  There was Velcro  And tiny little tacks  Huh  That was it  For a wall sized covering  Tarp 
[00:38:00]  Well it is  It's just like a tarp  It's like somebody  Shoved circus tent  Up against the wall  Like a good thing  Roland congratulations  Again on your party  Thank you for coming to the party  You're the talk of the building  Right now  Well to all the guys  Are the talk of the building  But I'm not allowed  To say who they are  But congratulations to you  There will be some  And I hope to get Fez  Into a best and worst dress list  Oh for the party  That's perfect  I know that  Ryan from the morning mashup 
[00:38:30]  Was telling me  How happy he was  That he got to talk to Fez  On the phone  At the party  What's funny  Is that I noticed  That they only call  Those people  The morning mashup  They come in  As the morning mashup  Oh yeah  Hey hi morning mashup  They're a unit  Goodbye morning mashup  Yeah yeah  You'll never see them separate  But this  I hope you all  Have a good weekend  We can talk about  Pizza party  I mean  All day  Forever  I see the morning mashup  Backslash Mark Zito  Yeah  Whoa  Yeah  Roland is critical  Of Mark Zito's affiliation  With the mashup  What is the problem there
