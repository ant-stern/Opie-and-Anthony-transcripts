<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a chaotic and nonsensical segment featuring the hosts' exaggeratedly frantic behavior. This transitioned into a prank call where they impersonated a senile Ronald Reagan, filled with bizarre and inappropriate comments about his health and love of ice cream.  The show then shifted to a discussion of Rick's bachelor party, featuring graphic descriptions of lap dances and the antics of "Psycho Mark," who was present in the studio.  This led into stories about "Drunk German Ed," whose post-bachelor party escapades, stemming from a military-related bullet wound in his head, involved multiple parties and numerous conflicts.  The ensuing discussion was peppered with offensive jokes.

A "worst of" segment followed, showcasing previous show clips, including a song about "Special Ed," and a phone call from Don Imus commenting on a video of an elderly person engaging in sex.  The hosts then discussed an article about Hugh Hefner's sex life, sparking jokes about aging and sex.  A caller shared an airport encounter with elderly people, prompting further discussions on aging, sex, and Viagra use among older men.  This was followed by an interview with Louie Anderson, covering his weight loss, childhood, and comedic style.  The conversation included numerous fat jokes and dark humor, culminating in a mock Family Feud game based on Anderson's life.

The broadcast continued with more from the "worst of" segments.  These included a phone interview with a 91-year-old Buddy Ebsen, discussing his age, website, and famous catchphrase; a racially insensitive bit with the Greaseman resulting in his removal from the studio; a caller complaining about the show's offensive language; a caller recounting misfortunes at a Gay Pride parade; a discussion of Jerry Seinfeld's alleged relationship;  Reverend Al Sharpton promoting his website and a video game, "Tawana Raiders 3," and a bit about Danny Glover's cab troubles; a CB radio story with "Dreamweaver"; and a comedic interpretation of an O.J. Simpson 911 call.  Throughout, Rick, a producer, filled in for absent hosts.

Another segment featured a comedic O.J. Simpson 911 call tape, followed by a prank call to a landscaping company, tricking "John Huber" into promising a collage of his bush-trimming work.  A bit about a fictional "Real World Midget Town" with crude jokes about dwarfs was then played.  Anthony recounted a high-profile party, detailing encounters with celebrities (Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Coleman) and feeling out of place.  Opie jokingly accused Anthony of "selling out."  A gay listener, Kyler, called to express offense at homophobic slurs, leading to a lengthy debate where the hosts defended their language, often using further homophobic remarks and engaging in discussions on the acceptability of certain ethnic slurs based on who uses them. Another caller, Gary, expressed support for the show.  A "Hi, Mom, I'm Gay" prank call followed, ending before completion.

The show continued with a discussion about Courtney Cox changing her name, followed by jokes involving her name and President Reagan's alleged dislike for George H.W. Bush.  Anthony recounted a raunchy Thanksgiving anecdote about his mother's drunken behavior, including frequent use of homophobic and racial slurs.  A caller, Cesar, joined, continuing the homophobic insults.  A caller impersonated Popeye, using crude sexual innuendo.  A fictional interview with Tom Brokaw, who hallucinated encounters with cartoon characters and mermaids after a scuba diving search for JFK Jr., including graphic descriptions of a sexual encounter with a mermaid, was played.  The segment concluded with Stephen Lynch performing a vulgar lullaby about divorce, and a caller impersonating Charlton Heston, who confessed to having sex with a chimpanzee and eating monkey meat.  This impersonation was also filled with sexual innuendo.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I'm used to the crazy people.  Oh, don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  Are you Vince?  No! It's our show!  I'm a madman!  I'm getting hit!  You sound like a stalk-raving mad person.  No! I'm getting hit!  No! No!  Don't ever underestimate the psycho factor in my head.  No!  Oh, V.N. Anthony.  How can you tell who's sane and who's insane? 
[00:00:30]  V.N. Anthony.  You try some counseling.  Piss me off, okay?  What a lady, what a lady, what a lady, what a lady.  Boy, rumors running rampant about Ronald Reagan's health.  Yeah, I saw that in the paper today.  They're saying some rumors have him on a 36-hour death watch.  Oof.  Like he's going to drop any second now, and the family's like, hey, shut up.  Well, his son is really pissed, Michael.  Michael Reagan.  He's quoted in the paper today.  I just saw him the other day, and he's fine. 
[00:01:00]  Quit scaring the family.  My kids have to deal with it.  People come up to them, and they ask me if something's wrong with Grandpa.  There's a lot wrong with Grandpa at this point.  Yeah, bad.  So Reagan's doing okay, and tonight I believe our buddy Tom Brokaw will be talking to Nancy Reagan.  Oh, really?  About the ex-president's health and Alzheimer's, and dispelling all the rumors that have been flying lately.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News. 
[00:01:30]  Okay, and I'll say thank you for giving me this opportunity to plug my interview with Nancy Reagan up here.  Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh, Tom?  Yeah?  You sound extra woozy today.  Oh.  You sound really out of me.  A little groggy today.  Yeah.  I was working on my car, you see, in the garage.  Yeah.  The door was shut, and the exhaust fumes was overcome by carbon monoxide. 
[00:02:00]  So, uh, it's a little groggy.  Thank God, Mrs. Brokaw holds me out of the garage just in the nick of time.  So I wouldn't have been able to perform an interview with Nancy Reagan.  Remember Nancy Reagan, first lady, her motto on drugs, just say no.  What?  What was that?  She said, just say no.  Oh, just say no, right. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which is probably what Ronald Reagan is saying when she wants to offer him up some of that  gas.  I'll have to remember to ask her that on tonight's NBC Nightly News interview with who?  Nancy Reagan.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News interview with Nancy Reagan.  NBC Nightly News.  Very good.  Tom Brokaw, NBC, Achille Laurel. 
[00:03:00]  Why are you calling us late?  Achille Laurel.  I must learn how to say Achille Laurel.  Achille Laurel.  All right, Tom, thank you.  Don't you have to go and work on the piece for tonight?  Yes, I'll have to work on that piece.  All right, Tom Brokaw, everyone.  There he goes.  Hey, Anthony, look at our luck.  Rick is informing me that the ex-president of the United States of America is on the hotline, 
[00:03:30]  Anthony.  Really?  The same line that Old Dirty uses to call our show.  Aw, isn't that a disgrace?  Hey, the ex-president is on the line, Ann, and he wants to dispel all these rumors about  his health.  Oh, good.  So let's go to the phone right now and, Ann.  What?  Where are you going?  I'll be right back.  You talk to the president a while.  I'll be right back.  Wait, this is... 
[00:04:00]  You start it.  I'll finish it.  I've got to take a leak.  Ann, this doesn't happen every day.  You don't get the chance to talk to an ex-president.  You start, just hold him on the line until I get back.  Oh, he just doesn't get it.  An ex-president on the line.  Hello?  Hello, oh, I mean...  Hello?  Yes?  Hi, this is Ronald Reagan.  Well, I wanted... 
[00:04:30]  I wanted to dispel the rumors.  All right, do we have the president, the ex-president on the line?  No.  Yes, I had to take the phone from...  I believe that was Sam Donaldson.  I'm not sure.  Well, I just wanted to dispel those rumors about my health.  Yeah, they're saying that there's a 36-hour death watch.  On who?  On you, Mr. Reagan.  Is Mr. Reagan there? 
[00:05:00]  No, no, you're Mr. Reagan?  I am.  Yeah, you're the ex-president of the United States of America.  Yes.  And I want to say...  Yeah?  ...I'm as spry as JFK Jr.  I want to dispel any...  Well, Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that wall.  No, no, no.  Hello?  No, you left the presidency a real long time ago, Mr. Reagan.  Where did I leave it?  I'm always forgetting things. 
[00:05:30]  The bombing starts in five minutes.  No, no, no, no.  We want to...  Hello?  We want to just discuss the fact that you're still alive and well.  God bless Pakistan.  Well, I'm fine.  I still will take a dump every morning like clockwork at 6 a.m.  Well, I don't get up till 7.  That old gag.  That old gag.  Hey, you were spotted on the streets of California in Brentwood eating ice cream. 
[00:06:00]  I was?  Yes.  Yes, I love ice cream now.  It's much the same as, you know, running the free world, eating ice cream.  One minute, you don't have your hand on the button that could destroy all mankind.  Yeah.  The next, you're eating Fudgy the Whale.  Can someone shoot me at home?  Well, they already shot at you.  We shouldn't be making jokes about that.  They did win.  Oh, way back in what? 
[00:06:30]  80?  80?  81?  Did I make it?  Yes, you did.  You made it through.  Fine.  Thank God for that.  Yeah.  Look, I'm a cat.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Well, every morning, I wake up and thank God I'm able to stare at Nancy's giant head.  She's like a Bergen Pez dispenser then.  It's like looking at a Mardi Gras float for guns.  Hello?  Hello? 
[00:07:00]  Is that why you...  356,018.  356,019.  300...  Why are you counting?  I'm counting my liver spots.  Four or five more and I'm a black man.  Looking forward to that.  Yeah.  Look, I can see through walls and I'm a pirate.  A best, matey.  You know what the good thing about Alzheimer's is?  Oh, what?  I'm with a new chick every day. 
[00:07:30]  Why is it always a skinny pig with a huge head?  That's so wrong.  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down that curtain rod.  I was leader of the free world.  Now, I don't even know when I take a dump.  Oh, wait.  I think I just did.  You're out of your mind.  It's off to Carvel for another.  Fudge either way.  Well, obviously, you're alive and well, Mr. Reagan. 
[00:08:00]  Yes.  God bless Iraq.  All right.  Hello?  Yeah.  Hello?  Yeah.  Okay, thank you.  All right.  There he goes.  The ex-president of the United States of America.  Or someone that sounds a lot like him.  Now, where the hell did Anthony...  Anthony?  Anthony?  What the hell happened?  It went on.  It.  Mr. President, it's an honor to speak with you.  I was always a big... 
[00:08:30]  He hung up.  I told you to hold him on the line until I got here.  I was trying.  He has Alzheimer's, you know.  You always hang up before I get back.  And it's like right before I get back.  He can't remember things.  I told him to hang in there.  You wanted to, you know, talk to him.  And, you know, I couldn't keep him on the line.  Damn it.  He missed a golden opportunity.  Ah, so many questions I wanted to ask.  Did he sound okay?  Oof.  Really?  Well, maybe next time.  I think Mr. Reagan had too many beers last night.  He was a little confused what voice he was doing today. 
[00:09:00]  Really?  I'm going to have to hear that on a tape or something.  Yeah, you might have to.  He thought he was still doing the Tom Brokaw.  He did?  He really?  Yes.  What an ass.  Maybe Mr. Reagan should get to bed before four in the morning.  Hey.  I was in bed early.  No, I'm not talking about you.  Oh, okay.  I'm talking about the president. 
[00:09:30]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  I have no clue what anybody's saying, but it's the funniest damn show.  More stupidity on the way.  One, oh, two, seven.  O.B. and Anthony.  We punish ignorance.  Hey, ass.  Turn down your radio.  One, oh, two, seven.  All right, it's the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  What's happening, man?  This is Rick, producer of the show.  Hey, it is Monday, a couple days after the big Christmas day. 
[00:10:00]  Hopefully, everybody did well.  Got some good gifts.  Remember, the guy's going to be off until next Monday, so we are doing the worst of all this  week, which is kind of cool.  We're going to dip back, grab some real old bits, grab some more recent stuff, stuff off  their Demented World CD, stuff that would have been on their new CD, but it's not coming  out just yet.  So we are in the process of doing that.  It's the worst of O.B. and Anthony all this week.  Any suggestions for the show, 212-757-1027, Spaz is working the phones. 
[00:10:30]  You can fax them to us at 212-957-WNEW, or just hope that you hear what you want to hear.  Got a lot of great suggestions from last week.  We'll try and get them on sometime today or maybe tomorrow.  And why don't we get right back to it, shall we?  It's the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  Here's some Stephen Lynch by request.  Now, more of the worst of O.B. and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027. 
[00:11:00]  The talk you can't ignore.  Don't touch those buttons either.  I see you looking at them.  When I was a boy of ten, I had a very best friend. 
[00:11:30]  Ed was kind with good intent, but just a little different, oh, special Ed.  Mama dropped him on his head.  Now he's not so bright instead.  He's a little bit special. 
[00:12:00]  Just a little bit special.  We'd play tag and he'd get hurt.  I'd play soldier, he'd eat dirt.  I liked math and a spelling bee.  Ed liked talking to a trio.  Special Ed. 
[00:12:30]  Mama dropped him on his head.  Now she keeps him in the shed.  Cause he's a little bit special.  A little bit special.  I ran track, hung out in malls.  Ed ran head first into walls. 
[00:13:00]  I had girls and lots of clothes.  Ed had names for all his toes of special Ed.  Mama dropped him on his head.  Now he thinks he's a piece of bread.  He's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special.  One day talking to special Ed. 
[00:13:30]  He grabbed a brick and he swung in my head.  And as he laughed at me, that's when I knew.  Special Ed just made me special too.  Now I laugh as I count bugs. 
[00:14:00]  I give strangers great big hugs.  Next to me, Ed is fine.  He's a f***ing Einstein.  9-0 special Ed and me.  Now we're not right in the head, you see.  Now we're not so bright.  Instead, we're a little bit special. 
[00:14:30]  Just a little bit special.  That bastard Ed made me special.  Just a little bit special.  All right.  There's the stimulus you know in love.  There's some redemption.  Please forgive me.  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027. 
[00:15:00]  And it's Opie and Anthony, phone number 212-757-1027.  Also receiving a lot of great faxes today.  Fax line 212-957-9639.  Of course, a very disturbing clip on the unofficial Opie and Anthony website.  Damn.  All right.  Let's get back to Rick's bachelor party.  We pretty much discussed the ride over there and we discussed how when I pulled out my  wad of money, the girls attacked me like they were seagulls at the beach going for a 
[00:15:30]  crust of bread.  That is the way to describe it, man.  Yeah.  You pulled that out and woof.  And Rick was late, so Earl got all the lap dances.  Well, Earl's the one I think, you seem to be the most uptight about the whole thing, Earl.  No, I wasn't.  When, when, well, yeah, no, let me be honest, you were.  You know, when that one first girl wanted to take you to the VIP lounge in the back, you 
[00:16:00]  resisted at first.  You were sitting in the chair going, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't want  to lap dance, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you're a silly rabbit.  Now, just thought that honor should have went to Rick.  Well, he wasn't there.  He wasn't there.  It would have, but he was not there.  And he wasn't showing up for another hour and a half at that point.  So it was just like, hey, you know, give it to Earl.  I just thought it was funny.  It was like, okay, who's going to be the first guy?  And everyone just turned around and pointed their finger straight at me.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you are the virgin. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, stop it.  Stop it.  You got it.  You got to give it to Earl.  There's no bell being rung there.  Ring the bell.  That's not appropriate.  I'm just in a dry spell.  That's it.  That's why you got to use it.  You got tumbleweeds rolling around in your crotch.  That dry spell.  Well, yeah, Earl got, I think, a lap dance every three minutes for the whole evening. 
[00:17:00]  Everybody was just, yeah, because you're talking and stuff.  Sometimes the lap dance gets in the way.  Yeah.  I'd rather watch someone else get in the lap dance.  Put it this way, Nunzio completely hooked us up with funny money and stuff.  Yeah.  And that was supposed to be for Rick, but because Rick was late, we used it on Earl.  Yeah.  By the time Rick, the bachelor, showed up, we were running out of funds quickly.  And the lap dance is just an odd thing, you know?  There's no touching.  So you just kind of sit in the chair with your arms on the armrests as this chick is going around you 
[00:17:30]  and gyrating in front of you and looking at you like you should be pounding her, you know?  But it's like, I will just stay completely still in this chair as you circle me, you know?  Yeah.  It's like when you used to play a stupid game with, like, your siblings.  I'm not touching you.  Look, I'm not touching you.  I'm not touching you.  And, like, you're right next to the person.  You put your hand, like, right next to that face. 
[00:18:00]  Why?  Why are you mad?  I'm not even touching you.  I'm not touching you.  That's how it is.  Yeah.  They get, like, right next to you.  It's the adult version of that game.  Yes.  My ass is not touching you.  My ass is not touching your nose.  All right.  So then I guess VIP room was great.  Yeah, the VIP.  You don't talk about the VIP room.  Oh, oh, oh.  Ixnay on the VIP room.  He'll say it was great.  You sit down, Danny.  How about a lap dance? 
[00:18:30]  So we were treated like kings and goldfingers, and then finally the night came to an end for most of us.  Yeah, I guess, boy, pretty much everyone left after a while.  Except for one guy.  I decided that there was no way in hell I could go home, Anthony.  With the smells and the things that were hanging off my clothes, it would be safe to stay away from home. 
[00:19:00]  You'd just end up smelling like a dancer.  Oh, man.  Right.  Like I said earlier, there were substances on my body that I could not recognize,  and I felt it was safe to stay away from the homestead because I wasn't functioning right where I could explain some of this stuff.  So I decided to crash at Ben's place, and my clothes, by the way, have officially been burned. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, really?  Yes.  Now, did your pants look like, well, did it look like you dropped some sour cream on there?  No, no, no, no.  Not that bad.  Out of the fajitas?  No, not that bad.  But first of all, I guess Mark, Psycho Mark, who's in the studio, he started getting really pissed at everyone.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Don't go there.  Don't go there?  Yeah.  You're a frigging loony with those dancers, man. 
[00:20:00]  That was part of the best part of the job.  You know what?  Guys can relate to this.  There's always one guy in the crew that is convinced that the girl actually likes him, and you'll be going home to bang the dancer.  Right.  That person in our gang is Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark.  Hello.  Who at one point, I think had too many dollars in both hands. 
[00:20:30]  Did I see a shoe-off with more dollars between your toes?  You were shaking money around like Trump, sitting front row.  You were like right there next to the stage, and a girl would come over and give him a lap dance, and he's getting into, like his arms are going, and he's almost dancing with the girl.  Correct.  I was having a good time.  Well, sure.  It's great.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Is it true you were thinking you had a shot at that girl?  No.  Of course not. 
[00:21:00]  Oh, now he says it.  What time did you get home?  Oh, like 3.30.  Let me stress, let me make it perfectly clear.  We started the festivities around 8.15.  It wasn't like we went out at 11, because most guys are like, oh, what's the big deal?  Four hours in a club?  No big deal.  No, we're talking eight hours in the club for Mark.  It's a hard day's work.  To the point where you're punching your pal Ben over there.  Well, Ben deserved the punch, but we'll get to that in a little bit.  Well, we can get to it now, because it all relates.  Now, Ben has an apartment in the village, right? 
[00:21:30]  Over east side.  Big.  Near NYU and all that.  And Ben has a really small place.  Correct, Mark?  You've stayed there?  Yes, I have.  When you first moved to the city?  Now, I asked Ben if I could crash on his couch, because there's no way, like I said earlier,  there's no way I could go home.  Right.  There was a slight problem with that.  Ben told me, yeah, no problem.  And that's the truth.  I thought everything was cool.  I found out when I arrived at Ben's place that there was already another guy staying there, 
[00:22:00]  another one of his friends, that is moving to New York City.  See, Ben has all his friends, Ant.  Yeah.  And they all move to New York City, but they start their journey in New York by staying with Ben for a month.  Right?  Is that true?  Totally right.  Who is this guy?  It's Ed.  Drunk Ed.  Drunk German Ed.  Drunk German Ed.  With a bullet hole in his head.  Drunk German Ed with a bullet hole in his head.  I guess this would be a great time to introduce Drunk German Ed to the show.  Who wants to tell the story of why he has a bullet?  Oh, he was in the mark in his head. 
[00:22:30]  He was in the German Army, and I think they were doing exercises with the Russians,  and he stuck his head up from behind a berm and got whacked with a 7.62 round in his head.  And the rumor is he was drunk when he was on duty, and he was, oh, what's on the other side?  Whack, whack.  And he got shot with live ammo in the head during training.  Exercises.  It's a true story.  He's got a dent in his head, eh?  That's why they call him Drunk German Ed with a bullet hole in his head. 
[00:23:00]  Pretty much wraps it up right there, doesn't it?  There you go.  True story.  So I go to Ben's, assuming, you know, it's going to be no problem.  We're going to just, you know, crash.  I got the couch.  Ben's got his bed.  Tiny little apartment.  No bigger than this studio we're in right now.  All right.  But there's Drunk Ed on Ben's couch.  With a 40.  With a 40 of Bex.  So, Ben, what did you say to Ed?  Well, I told him to go stay at Mark's. 
[00:23:30]  But he's, at like a quarter to one, he tells his guest, Ed, that he has got to leave his apartment.  Because I'm crashing there.  Oh, well, now I'm feeling uncomfortable.  I'm like, Ben, didn't you, like, work this out before you told me I could stay?  Guess not.  So Ed, all drunk and belligerent, gets up and goes to Mark.  Yeah, but you missed the whole point, Bill.  There's a bunch of points here, Mark. 
[00:24:00]  Now, Mark didn't want Drunk Ed at his place because he was convinced that he was taking one of the strippers from Goldfinger's home.  That is the truth.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  You're absolutely wrong.  That's not the reason why I wanted to.  You know your little honey's listening, but that is the truth.  I thought you were getting lucky.  Maybe I did.  You guys don't even know about it.  All right.  So now Ben just flat out kicks his friend out on the street at 1230 at night. 
[00:24:30]  And all I remember is Drunk Ed going, you don't keep a black man out on the street at 1230 at night?  Oh.  Oh, you forgot to mention it.  Ed is also black.  Yeah.  A black German.  He's a black German with a bullet hole in his head.  So now where did the story go?  Ed, he went to Mark's building.  Oh, wait a minute.  Before he even gets to the building, you were at the club, right?  You're like, oh, he's going to stay with me.  He's going to stay over at the place tonight. 
[00:25:00]  So Ed's going to stay with you.  And I'm like, Ed is not staying at my apartment.  There's no way that Ed is staying with me.  I already told you that Ed cannot stay at my apartment.  Now, logically, it would have been, like, logically, it would have been okay if I would have just, like, stayed at your place.  But, see, you live with a gay guy.  And I had a problem with that.  So I said, I'll go stay with Ben.  I guess.  And I'm just saying.  And the gay roommate doesn't want drunk German Ed with a bullet hole in his head staying at your house either. 
[00:25:30]  Last time Ed came over, he almost broke all the furniture, and he insulted my roommate.  What did he say?  He said something to the fact where he said, I hate the Jews, and my roommate is Jewish.  Isn't that amazing?  Even black Germans hate the Jews?  You'd think they would understand, like, oppression and stuff.  But my poor roommate, you know, being the way he is, got very offended.  Yeah.  And it was very upset.  And then Ed proceeds to blow a nasty, stinky beer farm into the apartment. 
[00:26:00]  And, you know, like, how those gay guys like to keep their apartments so nice and neat and stuff.  It's not good.  So, needless to say, Ed left a bad taste in my roommate's mouth.  So Ed is no longer proud of my apartment.  Not the first thing.  So drunk Ed goes to Mark's.  I thought that Mark's not home because, let's go back to the story, he's still trying to pick up the stripper. 
[00:26:30]  I was hanging out with Nunezio.  Nunezio is very cool.  Nunezio is the man.  So drunk Ed stayed in your lobby for how long?  Yeah.  Not kidding.  Three hours in the lobby of your building.  And he's waiting for Mark to get home.  Right.  So he can stay with him.  So he can sleep.  Right.  So meanwhile, he's sitting in the lobby of my building, bothering the poor dormant, just like making erratic conversation with the poor guy.  And trying to explain his plight as a black German stuck out in the city. 
[00:27:00]  With a little hole.  Right.  So I walk in, this is like 3.30, and all of a sudden I'm, you know, a little tired, I'm ready to go to bed.  Right.  I look.  Hey, Mark, you're there.  How are you?  I'm like, what the hell are you doing here?  Hey, I'll be staying home with Ben's house.  You didn't throw me out of the street.  But I'm like, you've got to be kidding.  He did throw him out of the street.  Oh, man, man.  Ben Flatow said, drunk Ed, you have to leave. 
[00:27:30]  Ben comes over to my place and say, hey, I don't have a place.  And I told Ed, I can't stay here.  You cannot stay here.  So I ended up loaning him like that other thing.  $200 to get a hotel room.  At 3 o'clock in the morning, 3.30.  Well, if my roommate woke up and saw a black guy sleeping on the couch, the place with a bullet hole in his head.  It would not be pretty tough. 
[00:28:00]  It's a gay guy.  Let me get this straight.  The gay guy doesn't like the black German guy.  With a bullet hole in his head.  Likewise, the black German guy doesn't like the Jews.  The gay guy takes offense to.  Is he Jewish?  Oh, okay.  Well, that one makes perfect sense.  Very Jewish.  And Ed's claiming that when Ben kicked him out of his apartment that we were mocking him and laughing at him.  Yeah, well, he told me, he goes,  Oh, kid, Ben was laughing at me and they threw me out of your apartment. 
[00:28:30]  And he's still drunk out of his mouth.  Slurring his words.  So anyhow, I get in the lead and the doorman is like, who the hell is that guy?  He spent the last three hours trying to converse with me about his bullet hole in his head and people throwing him out of the street.  But Ben, that was probably the coldest thing I've ever heard in a long time. 
[00:29:00]  That was pretty cold to put your own friend out of the street.  I mean, you could have let him stay, you know, in a corner, for Christ's sake.  Yeah, you're right.  Now looking back on it, you're right.  Oh, oh, now?  Oh, see, I was just warning you.  Oh, so funny.  I'm just standing here.  I'm just standing here.  That's how it went down.  Not nice.  And you're laughing, too, Elfie.  Yeah, Elfie.  You're laughing.  I think Ope's part of the problem, too.  Like, you didn't say anything like, did you say anything to Ben like, 
[00:29:30]  Oh, Ben, you can't do that, man.  Look, I'll make other arrangements.  Hey, look, Ben, I was tired.  Screwed the guy with a bullet hole in his head.  I'm tired.  I was tired.  One must know evil before he can condemn it.  Elfie.  One must see evil before he can condemn it.  Elfie.  This disgusting and strange.  Very, very cool.  Elfie.  Elfie and Anthony.  What?  What?  That's crap.  We can't put that on the air. 
[00:30:00]  F.M.  At 1-0-2-7.  All right, it is the worst of Elfie and Anthony.  What is happening?  It's Rick, the producer of the show.  In all this week, doing the worst stuff.  So if you've got any suggestions whatsoever, stuff maybe from the first week that you remember,  if you've been with the show that long, or from last week, because we had a couple  good bits from last week as well, and anything in between during the entire tenure of the  guys' stand here, the WNEW, we are doing it.  It's the worst of Elfie and Anthony. 
[00:30:30]  Dial it up, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  See what we can get on for you.  Got a lot of requests for OJ911, Jeter and Piazza with Mad Dog, Dreamweaver, a big request  for Dreamweaver and some wherever now.  All that stuff is on the way, so make sure you listen.  Also, some Louie Anderson next hour.  But let's get back to it, shall we, with the worst of Elfie and Anthony.  Again, any suggestions, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7. 
[00:31:00]  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Elfie and Anthony.  On FM Talk, at 1-0-2-7.  Hey, man.  It's O&A.  What up, Ant?  Uh, Don Imus here.  I just want to, uh, I got a problem with that videotape.  You saw the video, Mr. Imus?  No, uh, that was me in the video.  I have secrets out.  I'm really, uh, an old broad. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, of course, we're talking about the, uh, the video of the lady having sex.  She just happens to be a hundred years old, Imus.  See, without my big, fag cowboy hat on, uh, you can't tell I'm actually a woman.  Shut up, Bernard.  Did look like Imus, didn't it?  Uh, Imus with a wig, sure.  I can see that, Anthony, a little bit.  Not even with a wig.  See her?  She didn't have much hair.  Anywhere.  Enough said.  Everyone is just disturbed. 
[00:32:00]  We're trying to move on here.  Lewis.  Yeah.  What's up, man?  Yeah, just past, I'm in Newark Airport, man.  Just past, like, a group of old people.  Just made me shiver just walking by them.  The old guy almost needed a walker just to get out.  Oh.  Time blows.  I'm telling you.  I swear to God, man.  Yeah, you had to see these old people, man.  I'm, like, going, oh, my God.  Just imagining one of them.  Not even just the group.  Imagine an orgy out of it. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, know what the funny thing is about this?  There's an article in the paper about Hugh Hefner.  And there's a lot of people outraged because Hugh Hefner, at the age of 70, 71, is taking Viagra and banging four broads that are, like, in their early 20s.  Yeah, he says that just because he's gotten older, his taste in women hasn't gotten older.  He's still attracted to girls that are in their 20s.  And he's banging a girl that, he's banging twins that are 21 years old.  21 years old.  And he's got two more that he's doing.  Right.  And it's all because of Viagra, and he loves it. 
[00:33:00]  And most people will read about it, Hugh Hefner in the paper, and say he's a sick bastard.  Let me tell you what's sick.  Sick is what we just saw in the other studio.  Yeah, because I've got to tell you, I don't think there's probably much difference.  Now, I'm not saying every 71, 75-year-old woman looks like the 100-year-old one in there.  But a majority of them do.  You know?  So what does Hugh have to have sex with a woman that looks like E.T.?  To be morally right in your eyes?  What, are you kidding me? 
[00:33:30]  I mean, he's a single man.  God bless this guy.  God bless him is right.  Unbelievable.  And he says it's all because of Viagra.  And he says he, like, pops his stuff like it's M&M's, pretty much.  He's probably got a big bowl of it in the mansion.  Like, hey, I'm just popping him in his mouth.  You know?  Like you would eat peanuts or something.  Hey, what's up?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Like throwing him up in the air and catching him.  Jiggling him around in his hand like you do it, like peanuts. 
[00:34:00]  Tic-tacs, yeah.  Look at my bathrobe.  Oh, man.  Like a pup tent.  Don, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Just want to tell you, nobody would touch you happy with a 10-foot pole if it wasn't for  his millions of dollars.  You're right.  Good point.  I mean, it gives me a break.  Viagra, no Viagra.  I don't care.  That's my goal, to get very rich in the next 40 years.  That's it.  Then you go for Viagra.  If you can afford the girls, you go for the gun stuff.  Yeah, if I had the choice, I'm going to celebrate my 75th anniversary with my loved one. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Who are you kidding?  There's going to have to be an arrangement at that age.  I hope he's going to have a vending machine with Viagra and just pop it in.  A gumball machine.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  They must love that at their retirement homes, though.  You know?  The Viagra thing.  Before Viagra, what did they have to worry about?  Changing diapers.  The guy's drooling.  Hey, hey.  Over in the corner.  The old lady occasionally dying.  They wheel her out and stuff.  But, I mean, now, Viagra, you've got these horny old guys rolling around the halls. 
[00:35:00]  Well, think about it.  I don't think they allow it, right?  Because it's got to be by prescription.  So, they probably got to smuggle it in.  They're smuggling it in.  They got to smuggle it in.  It's like the joint.  Hey, you got any?  I'm hurting real bad.  I need some.  I ain't had wood in a week.  Screw the wood.  He hasn't leaked in a week.  He needs just a leak.  But then they're not looking.  You know, they're like half.  They're looking for the younger broads.  And what are you going to look for in the retirement home? 
[00:35:30]  Eunice in 2B needs a band.  Yeah.  Hey, sweetie.  Dustin.  Yeah.  What's up?  ONA.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just want to find out if this old lady ever appeared on Willis Scott's 100-year smucker's jar.  The smucker's jar?  Yeah.  It wasn't the smucker's jar.  You know, by the generation.  She was a very happy birthday to Loretta, 100 years young. 
[00:36:00]  Whoa, look at her go.  Loretta's hobbies include hobbing, but not hobbing.  Now the sounds of brittle bones breaking under the weight of doggie style.  There are just some things older people probably shouldn't do.  I don't know.  Loretta still gets up every day to do some gardening and the horizontal bar.  She likes knitting, looking for her family, and law. 
[00:36:30]  And gumming her neighbor.  Time is a bitch, though, man.  I remember working in a retirement home one day.  We were doing a job in there, and there was some old guy in a wheelchair just yelling.  He's sitting there, and he's just,  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Yelling.  And, like, I'm horrified, and no one's doing anything for the poor guy.  And I said to the woman at the counter, I go, this guy's yelling back there. 
[00:37:00]  He's just,  Hey!  And she goes, oh, no, that's Mr. Johnson.  And he does that all the time.  He does that all day long.  He used to be a gym teacher.  Like, oh, that explains it.  I know we put our gym teachers through.  But then I'm just thinking, picture the guy, you know.  Probably a gym teacher.  You've got to be in some kind of shape.  He's got his little whistling stuff.  And he's, years ago,  All right, guys, come on.  Back on the track.  Another lap. 
[00:37:30]  All right, we're going to climb her up today.  Football practice.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  Hit it.  Hit it.  Go, go, go.  And then you just add a little time.  Add a little time.  What do you got?  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  It just gives you a little perspective on things, you know.  Go for the gusto.  Live your life for God's sake.  Because someday you'll be there.  Hey!  Or like Loretta.  With people looking at you horrified at your time-ravaged body. 
[00:38:00]  It looked like every organ she had settled on top of her pelvis.  Like she, it looks like, all I could say is,  take Kate Moss, have her swallow a hippity hop,  and then leave her in a steam room for three years,  so the skin just kind of...  I cannot explain this enough.  But it puts a little perspective on things.  I guess you just got to go for the gusto while you're young.  Like you, Hefner.  Hey! 
[00:38:30]  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Sometimes you feel like a mess.  How do you do this?  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  Opie and Anthony.  One, oh, two, seven.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  We'll get back to more bits and stuff in just a little bit.  In the meantime, a quick music break with some James Addiction.  You deserve the best.  But that'd be a lot of worse.  Here's the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:39:00]  On FM Talk at one, oh, two, seven.  We'll get back to you.  We'll get back to you.  We'll get back to you.  We'll get back to you.  Swing your partner, start to dance.  Grab him and pull down his pants.  Doasty dough, knock water, turn.  Talk is one-eyed wonder worm.  We'll get back to you.  We'll get back to you.  We'll get back to you.  Hop and stop across the floor.  Show him what you've got in store. 
[00:39:30]  Grab those ankles, what a sight.  Drive him home with all your mind.  Now your partner's pretty big.  Drilling like an oil rig.  Grab a need and grab a beer.  Open it in your partner's rear.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[00:40:00]  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah!  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, those guys are fast!  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at one, oh, two, seven.  The talk you can't ignore.  We're talking about Louie Anderson.  We've stated in the past that I don't get it.  I don't...  He's not funny.  Don't you have to be funny to have the label a comedian?  Yeah.  I guess so.  I don't know.  But I don't know.  I guess this stuff is so tragic that it becomes funny or something. 
[00:40:30]  That's what it is.  People laugh a lot of times because they're uncomfortable.  Sometimes comics get on stage and they either have an affliction or something.  Remember the deaf comedian girl?  Yeah.  And people are laughing, but you can't understand a word she's saying, but everyone's laughing  because you're nervous and it's like, you better laugh.  Man, mine wasn't up with my ears, though.  I come off it and you're all starting to come watching.  What'd she say?  I don't know.  Just laugh.  Smile, clap, and laugh.  We interviewed her in L.A. a few years back. 
[00:41:00]  Remember that?  I'm leaving lips.  Yeah.  The publicist comes up to us and she goes, you want to talk to...  I forgot her name.  The deaf comedian.  And we're like, this is radio.  Oh, she reads lips real well.  Oh, that's good.  So as a gag, because we're just complete a-holes.  Yeah.  I started asking questions with my head turned.  Head turned.  And I'm a pretty good ventriloquist.  Watch.  So I wasn't even doing that.  I was like...  So, how are you doing?  Anthony wouldn't move his lips and I turned my head.  So, what's it like you're going to stand up calling? 
[00:41:30]  When you grab me a question?  That was pretty heinous, yeah.  We understand.  That was the second silliest moment that we had in the past.  Remember, we had to talk to...  Who's the guy with Peanut, the damn puppet?  What's the name of that guy?  God, I can't remember his name.  The comedian with the puppet.  Is it Jeff Dunham, I think?  Oh, yeah.  Jeff Dunham.  He does TV commercials now and stuff. 
[00:42:00]  Now his whole act is Peanut, the puppet.  What, he's an old guy or something?  Right.  Okay.  So, we were doing interviews from the Montreal Comedy Festival.  Yeah.  Through like a, you know, an ISDN line.  Right.  So, we weren't there.  No, we weren't there.  So, Jeff Dunham was in Montreal with his puppet Peanut.  Yeah.  And so, we're like, okay, everyone.  We got Jeff Dunham on the line and he's talking to us.  And then he goes, hey, you want to say hi to Peanut?  And we're like, yeah, okay.  And Peanut starts talking.  And then Anthony and I realize how completely stupid this is. 
[00:42:30]  And we go, Jeff, are you sitting there with the puppet in your hand right now?  He's like, yeah, well, I am.  And we just started laughing at him.  And then he had to just, then he just had to go away.  Because he doesn't, what do you need the puppet for?  It's radio.  It's a phone interview over the radio.  Yeah.  But he was still doing the act, even though it wasn't TV, where he had the actual puppet talking.  He needed the puppet.  It's really cool.  Like the movie Magic.  Magic with Anthony Hopkins, one of my favorite movies. 
[00:43:00]  All right.  Anyway.  Yeah.  So, you laugh.  People laugh just because they're nervous.  Yeah.  You know?  And he talks about how fat he is and how tragic it is.  So, people just start laughing.  All right.  So, let's count all the fat jokes here.  You got your bell for the fat jokes?  Oh.  This is Louie Anderson and Rosie O'Donnell this morning.  This is just the comedic geniuses at work here.  Well, hi, Louie.  Hi, Rosie.  How are you?  I'm great.  So, how's everything going?  Good.  Good.  I just got back from a trip around the world.  No kidding? 
[00:43:30]  Not the world, no.  No.  Good.  Yeah.  What was that about?  The guy with the balloon.  You know what?  You know why you don't fly a balloon?  One carry-on.  True.  Did you see him flying on a balloon?  And that big, oh, that big flame.  No grill on the ground.  If you did have a great game, you have an old flying Burger King.  Have you ever been in a balloon before?  No, no, no.  I was in one once.  Really?  It's scary.  Yeah, in Colorado.  Who weaves the basket out of here?  Yeah.  I had to get reinforced.  You know, it's a lot of stress. 
[00:44:00]  I'm a real crazy person, so it's tight.  Right.  Where did you go?  You went just all over?  I was in Australia first.  Beautiful place.  Working or just living?  Just living.  Really?  It was good.  They had the, what is that, the Formula One?  Do you know what that is?  The race car?  The race car, the little ones.  Every time I got in a cab, they said, are you here for the Formula One?  I go, yeah, I'm driving.  Gotcha.  You know what's there, the ones with the, like, cigarettes and beer thing?  Yeah.  Yeah, because if the car doesn't kill you, the products won't.  Right. 
[00:44:30]  My car was a Dunkin' Donuts car.  Oh, there it is.  That would be my car, too.  Do you have a favorite Dunkin' Donuts place?  Um, I like those cream things.  What are they?  That's the vanilla cream thing?  Oh, honey.  Did you ever go in and they got just the one left?  Yeah.  You know, it's kind of, it's been somebody's question.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I always get it anyway.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  The last one.  Right.  You know.  Now, you've lost weight recently, haven't you?  Yeah, I lost about 70 pounds.  Good for you, Willie. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, clap for that guy.  Clap for that movie.  Just like me, it's a life thing.  It's a horrible thing.  And what happens is about 6 o'clock at night, they lock me in a cage.  Because, you know, I just put it in at night.  That was a big thing for me.  That was the thing.  Because we work at night.  Sure.  You work at night, you're doing stand-up, then you go, and you're going to have your meal.  Right.  It's 2 a.m., your stomach's full, you go to sleep.  Yeah, that's not good.  So what's your cutoff is now?  6 p.m.?  Yeah, about, yeah.  Yeah.  How do you do when you're working, like in Atlantic City this weekend?  You know, I just eat the fruit and stuff at night. 
[00:45:30]  You know, it's just, the food, you know.  What's his name?  He can't have drugs.  Money, a donut.  I take the donut every time.  Same with me.  Yeah, it is true.  If you try to eat healthy, you go to a fried food.  You ever do that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have that grilled chicken sandwich there with the fake grilled munch.  Right, right, right.  You want fries with that?  Well, you're going to pressure me.  What fries you want?  How about that basket you're frying in? 
[00:46:00]  Oh, no.  It's hysterical.  You know, I want to start the jump club on the air, you know.  I know, I want to chill.  You do?  That's so nice.  And I said, oh, she started the jump club.  That's a mistake.  It is a mistake.  Because the pressure gets on you.  Yeah, but I said to everyone, it's not really to lose weight.  It's to get healthier because I have two kids and I want to have my heart good.  Sure.  So we did the workout and I'm going to tell you, January, February, Louie, I was so good.  Every day I'm doing the workout.  Right.  I don't do it anymore. 
[00:46:30]  I don't.  I'm trying to get back to it.  I know it's hard for people to save you a jog.  I don't know if I have a plan.  I was never meant to exercise.  Yeah.  I'm lazy.  I know.  If I could do this from my bed, I wouldn't.  Yeah.  You know, like, I'm so lazy that, you know how the remote control somehow ends up on the  floor by your bed?  Yeah, yeah.  You need to look.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I'll call people from the other end. 
[00:47:00]  Hey, come on.  That's what it is from, folks.  Now, hey, listen, why don't you're in here?  Is it just a genius?  Isn't this good stuff?  Are you doing this, Anthony?  At this point, it was amazing.  Rosie actually started orbiting because they're gravitational poles of each other.  So Rosie started orbiting Louie.  And it was just so weird to see her floating in his gravitational pole.  The furniture was getting sucked up into his black hole. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, amazing.  Man, this is just top shelf stuff.  Oh, wow.  When you have two heifers talking about eating and food and being fat, it doesn't get any better.  Honestly, we can't compete with this stuff.  This is incredible.  I totally do the same thing.  It's so bad.  Because when you do start working out, you do feel better.  And, you know, that's the thing.  And also, when you have lost the finish up of it, you're like, I feel like you want to get it.  What's that to her, chewing?  When you're working out, you feel better. 
[00:48:00]  You know, chewing, swallowing.  Yeah, you know what?  I never see.  I never look.  I look in the mirror.  I don't see a fat person.  I see a person who happens to be fat.  Right, right, right, right.  What does that mean?  And do you hear the people laughing?  Yeah.  Like, he's seriously trying to get this profound thing.  When I look in the mirror, I don't see a fat person.  I see a person that's fat.  That's fat.  And people are like, dude, you're not supposed to laugh.  Louie being profound.  He's not being funny now. 
[00:48:30]  See, they don't even know when he's trying to be funny and not.  They're just laughing at everything he says because he's fat.  Well, Louie, you know something?  When you look in the mirror, you see a fat person and a person that's fat.  You see a big, fat person because you're fat.  You want to hear a little more of this?  Sure.  Friends, Sarah, you know, like, I think that everybody who looks like my mom is heavy.  Right.  Everyone who looks like my dad, you know, they're drunk.  But, um, oh, oh, there's that.  Dad drunk joke.  There it is.  That didn't take long.  Here come the drunk.  Yeah, I like how my dad is drunk and beating me with a whiskey bottle. 
[00:49:00]  Laugh, laugh hard.  It's true.  You know, you get the genetics, you know.  Right.  And I look like my mom.  And everyone who looks like her is heavy.  So.  Yeah.  But, you know, it's the health thing.  I do agree with you.  It's really difficult.  You know, everyone said that about the genetics and everything.  And, you know, like, you know, I always comforted myself.  Oh, my mom was Irish.  She was stocky Irish.  This is just how Irish people are.  Then we had the cores.  Racist remark.  Totally Irish.  And I thought, oh, I've been longing to myself. 
[00:49:30]  They've got the same Irish genes as me.  I know.  You know.  It is.  It's just that, you know, people don't.  And they treat you differently when you're big.  You know.  That's true.  You know, when someone's house, they steer you towards the third of your furniture, you  know.  Yeah.  What happened, honestly?  What did they do that?  Oh, sit on the concrete sofa there.  Oh, my concrete sofa.  How's that from the winter, you know.  Say, the concrete can make its way, don't they?  But I did notice that people get treated.  Because when I was, like, my thinnest, even at my thinnest, I still don't think  I've been, like, I had a tucked-in shirt. 
[00:50:00]  That's the big proof to me.  Right, that is.  When you are a tucker.  When you can tuck.  When you can tuck.  When you can tuck and not wear a coat.  Exactly.  Just a pure tuck.  Right.  I'm talking T-shirt, jeep, tuck.  I was at the gas station at self-serve, and these two men came out of the gas station  to help me.  And they were so nice.  And it was self-serve.  But they were like, what do you need?  And they were like, and I got so scared.  Because I never had that kind of attention.  Come on, Rosie.  If I wanted to get someone's attention, I would be funny.  Right.  Exactly.  So when I got the attention for being a tucker, I'm not kidding. 
[00:50:30]  I went to Baskin-Robbins.  I'm not kidding, Hillary.  I did.  It's not even a joke.  That's where they come up with the 31 flavors.  Exactly.  That's what I tried all of them, you know?  Yeah, I love.  She's talking like this.  And you grew up in the free, you had a stressful childhood.  Yes.  I'm hearing.  My mom fed us when things were bad.  Yeah.  See, you didn't have money.  Yeah.  There's some food.  Right, right.  Right.  Yeah.  And it gets, it's very psychological.  I love what you have done with your painful childhood in many ways.  I really do, Louie. 
[00:51:00]  Your books, the letters and everything with your dad, and talking about how difficult it  is, and an alcoholic family, and the pain that still reverberates in the head.  Get over it, fat boy.  It's been so inspirational to me, and to so many people, and I think very brave of you  to do it.  Thank you.  Very brave.  Very brave, Louie.  Very brave.  Oh, yes.  Standing over here.  It's like, it's the reason I'm doing the Family Feud, because the thing's always been  family for me.  Family Feud.  And here, you know, it's just this year, I had the Sanderson Family Reunion in Las Vegas, 
[00:51:30]  where I flew all my 59 family members, and I really find that...  Would you use a galactic tank or shuttle?  All those things.  They're holding that family.  It is difficult, and it's lifelong, and you know, you have to turn it around.  Right.  Otherwise, you know, you're Ted Bundy.  It's true.  That's the only way through the pain is through the pain.  Right.  You can't avoid it.  You can't dance around it.  And we're taught in this society to avoid it.  Right.  Watch TV, do this, do that.  But the work that you do helps people, including me, I think, go through it and face it as 
[00:52:00]  opposed to, you know, not dealing with it.  And Life with Louie, great, great animated series that is on the Fox Network, right?  Yeah.  And you do the blood for yourself and your dad.  And I love it.  I love what you said when you won your Emmy.  Tell everybody.  Do you remember what you said?  I love it.  I think this is proof that you can take a terrible childhood and make something good out of  one.  Yes!  Yes, Louie!  Yes, bravo!  And I thank you so much for being here.  It's an Atlantic City this weekend.  Hallelujah.  Anderson. 
[00:52:30]  Come on.  He's saying he would be like Ted Bundy?  Yeah.  If he didn't have that great humor that he has?  Yeah.  That's a stretch.  Ted Bundy was skinny and got chicks.  That's how he was able to kill him.  Now, you did hear at the end of the interview, though, he's going to be hosting the new Family  Feud.  Family Feud.  That's what you need.  Remember what happened to the last host?  He hung himself.  He hung himself.  He hung himself?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Louie sounds more depressed than Ray Combs ever did. 
[00:53:00]  You think Louie Anderson's going to do the whole Richard Dawson and try to, like, get  kisses and stuff?  I'm out of kiss, honey.  Hey, baby.  What's your name?  Yeah.  Hey, welcome to the feud.  I'm fat, and I was abused as a child.  All right.  Look at the family is coming to the table.  Give me a kiss, huh?  Thank you.  Do you have any food stuck between your teeth I could suck out while I kiss you? 
[00:53:30]  I'm starving.  I haven't eaten in seconds.  Gee.  All right.  If we could get the first two contestants up here, we surveyed our audience the top five  answers on the board to this question.  What has your father hit you with?  All right.  Um, Louie, uh, a baseball bat?  No.  Well, that's the number two answer. 
[00:54:00]  My father hit me with a baseball bat.  All right.  You have a chance to steal.  Um, Louie, is it a whiskey bottle?  Yes, it's a whiskey bottle.  That's right.  He lobbed it at my head after calling me a big, fat bastard.  Oh, there's a Louie's dad.  Oh, what a scream.  All right.  Next question.  Surveyed our audience's top three answers on the board.  This question. 
[00:54:30]  What was the cruelest thing you were called in school by your little classmates?  Turned you into an introvert, reverted, eating freak machine.  Uh, big, fat, tubby, marshmallow, cellulite, 200 pounds of chewed bubblegum ass?  And that's the number one answer.  I never knew what the end of that was because my head was always in the gymnasium toilet after.  Right when they started saying it.  Then I'd have to go to the cafeteria and eat Twinkies and Po-Ho's. 
[00:55:00]  Feed this 450-pound Jabba the Hutt and Nest freak show ass.  But I've turned tragedy into comedy.  If you find the comedy, give me a call.  Hey, we're playing the feud.  Family feud.  Look who it is.  It's the Anderson family.  My own family coming up.  Hi, Dad. 
[00:55:30]  How...  Hey, he's going to call me a big, fat, tub-ass, lard-ass again.  This is great stuff, isn't it?  Here comes my big, fat, enabling mother.  Gee, thanks, Mom.  Here I am in the midst of turning tragedy into comedy.  Can you feel it, people?  I feel the comedy.  Excuse me, have I eaten in two minutes?  I'm way past my eating time. 
[00:56:00]  Top five answers on the board for this.  When do I have to eat?  Uh, now?  That's right.  Now.  Right now.  Thank you for playing the feud.  I gotta eat.  Thank you, Dad.  I gotta tune in to that.  Yeah, I can't wait to see that on TV.  Thanks, Fat Louie.  All right.  I hope you enjoyed that.  Whoever's still listening. 
[00:56:30]  Tudes with Tudes.  I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  We're out of control.  We're so lazy.  All right.  Knock it off.  1027.  All right.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  What's happening, man?  This is Rick sitting in for the guys.  These damn things are never queued up correctly.  Jesus Christ.  If there's something you want to hear in the worst of today, 
[00:57:00]  212-757-1027.  We will try and hook you up with it in terms of bits.  Guys, we'll be back next Monday.  That's January the 3rd.  We've got some great stuff lined up for next week.  But you're going to have to tune in and listen and enjoy that.  In the meantime, do pick up the phone.  212-757-1027.  Spaz is working the lines.  Looking for any requested bits.  Got a request for a couple more calls for Dreamweaver.  That, I will tell you, right now is coming up in the 4 o'clock hour.

And a whole lot of other stuff.  Mad Dog.  Stall.  And even some dice.  Going to be worked in in just a little bit.  But right now, let's get to the worst of where they were talking about Buddy Epson.  The third phone call to Buddy Epson.  This has happened right after Dana Plato died,  after talking to Howard.  And the guys were looking to hopefully, you know,  find someone who's going to die soon, 
[00:58:00]  so they could have the last interview.  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027.  Buddy Epson.  I remember him, the Jed Clampett character from the Beverly Hillbillies.  Also, the geriatric gumshoe Barnaby Jones.  That's right.  Also, wasn't he supposed to be the original Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz?  Yeah.  He was allergic to the makeup or something?  Allergic to the silver paint, Opie.  To the silver paint?  Okay. 
[00:58:30]  The roll thing went...  Oh, oh, oh.  Hello?  Hi.  Yeah.  Are you live on the line?  Yes.  On the radio right now?  Mrs. Livingston, yes, we are.  Okay.  Hold on.  Okay.  Mrs. Livingston is the courtship of Eddie's father.  Hello?  Buddy Epson.  Yeah?  Oh, you hear us today.  What?  It's Opie and Anthony.  How are you today, sir?  Are you the one that's been calling? 
[00:59:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Well, you got your power on today.  I couldn't hear you because you were, you know, you were sub-powered the other day.  Do you hear us good today?  I hear you good now.  Oh, praise the Lord.  Somebody pressed the right button again.  Absolutely, buddy.  Well, let's make sure, though.  Give us a nice well-doggy.  A well-doggy?  Yeah.  Well-doggy.  All right, buddy.

And Barnaby Jones, one of my favorites.  Fantastic.  You were great in that.  Thank you.  And not many people know you were quite the hoover in your day.  I was quite the hoover.  I started out in New York.  You were in New York, aren't you?  Yes, New York.  Well, the Amsterdam Theater, which has been renovated, I understand, on 42nd Street. 
[01:00:00]  Yes.  Well, I started to open there.  Really?  Did you used to dance with the showgirls?  1928.  28?  Yeah.  Oh, my.  Now I'm painting.  Oh, you paint now?  Yeah.  Well, maybe we can.  I have something new under the sun, a folk art spin-off of a classic television show painted  by one of the actors, me.  Really?  It's called Uncle Jed Country. 
[01:00:30]  Uncle Jed Country.  Uncle Jed Country.  That's on the, you know, the, what do you call it, you know, the fast-selling thing.  Infomercial.  The what?  I don't know.  The website.  Oh, the website.  Oh, website.  Oh, the World Wide Web.  Wait, you're on the World Wide Web.  Uncle Jed?  Yeah.  You're on the World Wide Web now?  No, website.  Oh, website.

Hey, buddy, how old of a man are you these days?  What?  How old of a man are you these days?  Uh, not 100 yet.  Uh, 91.  91.  91.  God bless you, buddy.  Many more.  Many more, buddy.  You want to know the secret of my, uh, success?  Yeah, what's the secret of, uh, your, uh, long life? 
[01:01:30]  Use it or lose it.  What?  Oh, buddy, that's a, buddy.  I believe that's an exclusive.  I think our lawyers, uh, are going to want to talk to you after that line.  Who wants to talk to me?  Use it or lose it.  Use it or lose it.  Very nice.  When was the last time you used it?  Uh, not too long ago.  All right.  I imagine Uncle Jed didn't.  When I was 90.  When you were 90.  Well, I'm talking.  It wasn't with that, uh, Miss Hathaway, was it? 
[01:02:00]  Nah.  Nah.  Yes, it wasn't.  Okay.  Nice to talk to you, fellas.  Well, we wanted to ask you a quick question about, uh, The Wizard of Oz.  Is it true that you were supposed to be the original, uh, Tindley?  The Wizard of Oz?  Well, I wrote a book called The Other Side of Oz.  Have you seen it?  Uh, no, I haven't.  No.  It's available at the bookstore.  If they don't have it, they'll order it.  All right.  Uh, it's also available.  On, uh, on the website.  Which is www.buddy.com, whatever it is. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah, boy, you're going to fool around with those numbers.  You're fantastic, bud.  All right, we'll figure it out.  Yeah, The Other Side of Oz will tell you all you want to know about Buddy Epson and a lot that you don't want to know.  Uncle Jed, Uncle Jed, I got me a website.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  All right, buddy.  All right, guys.  Have a good day.  Good talking to you.  Right.  Hey, hey, Wade, you've got to give us one last, uh, Well Doggie there.  You ready?

Uh, Buddy?  Buddy.  Okay, very good.  Oh, I remember talking to him a couple of years back and the Well Doggie sounded a little better.  A little better?  Maybe we ought to pull that one and compare the two and see how Well Buddy's doing.  Maybe we can judge on how much longer he'll live by how his Well Doggie's come out.  That's not a bad idea. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  All right, Buddy Epson.  We got a real interview that time.  Yes, we did.  We learned a lot there.  God, if he drops that door.  Not that I would wish it on anybody, but if it's going to happen.  You know, I really don't want it to happen now after we've gotten to know him a little bit.  Gotten to know him.  He's part of the show, much like Ben and Earl.  Right.  What is this for the hell to do in here?  Don't even try to figure it out.  Just go along with it.  Whatever.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027. 
[01:04:00]  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  1027.  I was being offensive.  Yadda-doodle-dee.  Gobbledy-goo.  Greaseman, you really got to get another job because we're sick of having you on our show.  Watergottle, please hire me.  Somebody hire me, the Greaseman, for a radio show.  Well, I hear that you're looking at a job for Crayola.  Yes.  With Crayola, I should say.  Well, actually, the Greaseman is coming out with his own line of crayons. 
[01:04:30]  Racially insensitive crayons.  I looked in the paper this morning.  I saw, the Greaseman saw that Crayola is removing Indian red from their box of crayons.  Because it's not politically correct and they don't want to tick off any people.  Insensitive to the Injuns.  That's right.  As we like to call them, the Cowboy Killers.  I remember, as a cowboy slinging lead against the Injuns, their arrows pushing over my head. 
[01:05:00]  The Redskin.  But yes, very upset about Indian red in the crayon box.  So Crayola pulled it.  Well, they're going to continue making the color.  They want people to come up with a new name for that color.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Let's see.  How about Kimo Sabe?  Yeah.  Yaddle doodle.  Snarling.  Bone dry.  Bone dry.  Yeah.  You're just not politically correct, Greaseman. 
[01:05:30]  Well, I'm hoping to get some money here with my new crayon line.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  Greasola crayons.  Greasola crayons.  Greasola crayons here.  His sharpener on his side makes the crayons as pointy as my head.  Yaddle doodle.  Bone dry.  Bone dry.  Now, could you name some of the crayons that you will be offering?  Well, let's say a young child, a little young wave, wants to draw the sun.  Oh, that's nice.  A nice bright sun.  Sure.  A little picture, eh, in his kindergarten class. 
[01:06:00]  You know what color he'd use?  Huh?  In the Greasola crayon set.  What?  Chink yellow.  Yaddle doodle.  Just a big circle, and you'd color it in with some chink yellow.  Yaddle doodle.  And, of course, you can't complete the scene without maybe some flowers basking in the heat of that chink yellow sun.  Well, that would be nice.  Sure.  Right?  So you draw some tulips.  Okay.  And, of course, you use homo pink.  Homo pink, eh. 
[01:06:30]  A shade of pink loved by bone smugglers everywhere, eh.  Yaddle diddle.  Doodle die.  How about, uh, Polish purple?  Ah, Polish purple sounds neat.  Polish purple.  Why Polish purple, though?  Well, look, it's green.  Little diddle die  The crazy polacks can't get the colors right there  Oh my  Mick, Mick Green  Mick Green  That's the color of the shamrocks 
[01:07:00]  That's right  Mick Green, Mick Green  Bone dry, bone dry, yeah  Yadda dadda  Wow  And of course, wetback brown  Of course  And then of course, I have the special  Italian crayon there  And what's that?  Look, it's a grease pencil  Greasy little dago pencil  Yadda dee doodle die  Bone dry, bone dry  Very nice  Oops, I'm being removed from my seat 
[01:07:30]  Hey, my CBS brass there  Oh, it's happening again, Dan  Whoa  Yadda dee doodle die  They're yanking him out of the studio again  Whoa, look at that  CBS boss has dragged him out again  He's going to go back on his apology tour  Grease all the crayons  Grease all the crayons  Boy, that's kind of cute  A little insensitive there  Big time  All right  The Opie and Anthony show  Throwing that  Jumping all over each other  Okay, terrific  Hi, Annie W 
[01:08:00]  You know, for years  I've tried to call this radio station  It would be busy for hours  But now nobody's calling  Because nobody listens to you  Because Opie and Anthony  So much  That's the funniest thing  I've ever heard in my life  What's the matter?  What's the matter?  We made fun of you, Bill Clinton  What's the matter? 
[01:08:30]  You wish you were Monica, don't you?  Play us some rock and roll again  Shut up  Shut up  We've had it with you  No, you suck  You're the same person  I called last week  To say you're not listening  And you're listening  Bye-bye  Bye-bye  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha  A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha  It's beyond moronic  What's up, moronic?  OVS 1027.  Any W complaints? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, hi.  I want to complain about these two idiots you have there in drive time.  I've been listening to this station since the day it came on the air.  I want to work with you, sir.  What seems to be your problem with these gentlemen?  They just had a woman on the phone who called us to complain about foul language.  Right.  And they're telling her, don't worry, you'll keep listening and we'll keep pissing you off.  What is that?  And you don't think that's right for them to put on somebody that wants to voice a legitimate complaint?  To put them on the air.  To put them on the air like that.  A woman that calls a complaint about language. 
[01:09:30]  You feel it degrades them.  You feel it degrades the caller and makes them seem stupid.  It absolutely does.  And not only that, I mean, forgetting for a minute about the call.  Right.  Yes.  Continue, sir.  The station has gone downhill.  That's it.  Opie and Anthony.  Is this the best radio you guys can come up with?  1027.  All righty, this is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:10:00]  Happening all week this week.  Hopefully you guys are enjoying your vacation.  If you are on a vacation, if you celebrate Christmas, I should say.  Hopefully everybody got some good stuff.  I know I did.  And I'm going to hook you guys up with some more good stuff throughout the entire week while we do this worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  The guys will be back on Monday, so never fear.  They haven't been fired or anything.  Everything's going good so far.  Well, as far as we know. 
[01:10:30]  But, yeah, if you've got a request for the worst of today, 212-757-1027.  Spaz will take your request.  And why don't we just get right back to it, shall we?  As Saul, the guy who sues everybody about one thing or another, calls in.  This time, it's about the gay pride parade that he attended.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1027.  I'm hearing there's a guy on the line that got very injured at the gay pride parade. 
[01:11:00]  I was very injured at the gay pride parade.  Yesterday, huh?  Oh.  So what happened to you?  Well, I went down there because it was for gay pride.  Yeah.  But I thought gay was happy.  Like, in the Flintstones song, we'll have a gay old time.  So you thought just it would be very festive.  People would be just having a happy time.  Oh, I was wrong.  Yeah? 
[01:11:30]  Boy, the weather yesterday was the Triple H's.  What do you mean the Triple H's?  Hazy, hot, and homo.  I didn't know.  Oh.  I wanted to march in the parade.  Yeah?  So I just joined in.  Uh-huh.  And a young man said, march in front of me.  I'll bring up your rear.  And, oh, he did.  Oh.  And I started chanting with the rest of them.  Because I didn't know.  We're here. 
[01:12:00]  We're queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to us.  We're here.  We're queer.  We're...  Oh.  That didn't go over too well?  No.  Then I went there on one of the rides they had set up.  What do you mean they had rides at the Gay Pride Parade?  Richard Gere's Tunnel of Terror.  And, oh, it's like a slide, but you dress up like a gerbil.  Oh, shit.  And slide in.  And I was banged about on some faux intestines. 
[01:12:30]  Oh.  Oh.  And I had just gotten back from England.  Yeah?  So I got used to calling cigarettes fags.  Okay.  So I was going around going, hey, give me a fag.  I need a fag in my mouth now.  I said, look, I'm dying for a nice big fag to suck on.  And all this kind of grown man puts his stuff in my face.  Oh.  Oh.  Well.  I could imagine my shock. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, how was it?  I'm suing for that.  Oh.  So I ducked out into a bar.  All the stools were upside down.  That old gag.  But I did find some lovely ladies in there.  Oh, ladies at the Gay Pride Parade.  Well, I'm quite the stud.  I was making time with them and making out at the bar.  Oh, yeah.  This poor girl, though, like, she had something in her throat.  Why?  That she couldn't swallow because it was making a lump in front. 
[01:13:30]  I was going at it.  That was a dude.  Oh.  Because then I saw something twitching in her dress.  So I picked up a bottle and hit it.  And she punched me.  I thought it was a rat.  Oh.  Then some man asked if he could push in my stool for me.  That old gag.  So I ran out of there and caught the parade, more of the parade.  Yeah.  I saw the baton twirlers. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  They were spinning the batons.  But you should see how they catch these things.  How do they catch them?  Well, put it this way.  They could do a handstand and catch it.  Because that's what they weren't doing.  Oh.  All I know is I maybe had too much to drink.  And I woke up dressed as the Indian from the village people with my ass burning.  In a place called the Piledriver.  Oh.  So I'm suing all involved. 
[01:14:30]  I'm very injured.  All right.  I can't sit down.  God damn it.  All right.  Well, I'm sorry to hear that you got injured at the Gay Pride Parade.  Oh.  Are you done?  I'm done.  All right.  Go.  There goes the guy that got injured at the Gay Pride Parade.  Where the hell did Anthony go?  He missed it.  Oh.  Boy.  Anthony.  Boy.  Producer with.  Boy.  Bad.  Gay.  Gay.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:15:00]  1027.  You see in the paper Jessica or Skyler's Jessica Sklar.  Sklar.  Whatever.  Whatever.  Jessica Whore.  Whore.  That's what she is.  I don't care what her last name is all dirty.  It's Jessica Whore.  She's banging Jerry Seinfeld.  Mr. Comedy Penis.  Huh?  Didn't she?  Didn't she got married?  Went on a honeymoon. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Missed her husband and then started going out with Seinfeld?  Right.  Three weeks they were on their honeymoon.  They get back.  She starts working out at the gym.  She meets Jerry.  Hey.  How you doing, Jerry?  And she couldn't resist the comedy of Jerry Seinfeld and took off with the guy.  But it turns out it's not the first time this has happened.  What do you mean?  In her case?  No, no.  In Jerry's case.  Oh, yeah.  Well, a Long Island classmate.  I read about this.  Seinfeld stole my date.  How big of a loser does this guy have to be? 
[01:16:00]  This guy's from Massapequa.  Went to Massapequa High School with Jerry.  Johnny Spuds Marino.  Does he know Johnny Action?  Johnny Spuds Marino still hasn't forgiven the comic for stealing his prom date in junior year.  This guy, it turns out, didn't even ask this girl to the prom.  Right.  He wasn't dating her.  They were not, like, dating.  They weren't a couple or anything.  He was looking to ask her out to the prom.  And Jerry asked her first.  And this guy's holding a grudge that Jerry stole his Sherry Goldstein away from. 
[01:16:30]  Right.  She wanted the comedy penis.  The Jerry comedy.  Even back then, I was dressing it up like Costanza.  It was a little Costanza.  I'd put hair on top of it and say, look, it's Kramer.  He lied.  Yeah.  Seinfeld beat him to it.  You know what's really disturbing about this article, though?  They started asking people, I guess, around Massapequa about Jerry being now engaged to be married. 
[01:17:00]  Sophomores Allison, I don't know, Allison and this other girl, Karen, 15 and 14.  They're asking high school kids?  Yeah.  Distraught over the news Jerry would finally wed.  I really love him, the girl said.  I don't want him to get married.  He'll be unavailable.  Jerry's cruising Massapequa High School looking for these two girls.  I wouldn't doubt it.  14 and 15.  I got Pokemon cards!  Pokemon, honey!  Well, she can't resist!  Because she's a whore! 
[01:17:30]  You don't come back after three weeks on your honeymoon.  You know, she's probably still got the bridal gown on to be filed by Jerry.  Jerry and his funny penis.  Hey!  Here she goes.  Jerry, the penis, and her for coffee down at the diner.  Huh?  Kramer's going to slide in the door and go, oh, sorry, Jerry.  I didn't know you're banging the bride.  Huh?  I'll come back later. 
[01:18:00]  All right?  That qualifies as a whore!  Happy honeymoon, huh?  Whore.  And can't try on the wedding certificates.  And she's banging!  Hey, Jerry, you nail her in her bridal gown!  Or do you wait for her to take that off?  Huh?  I now pronounce you man and wife.  You may now hob Jerry Seinfeld's now! 
[01:18:30]  Huh?  Whore!  Whore!  And qualifies!  She throws the bouquet and catches the funny man's penis!  How about a little downtime, sweetie?  Huh?  Whore!  Something old, something new, something borrowed, and, uh...  And she blew my ear!  What kind of broad does this?  Three weeks. 
[01:19:00]  She comes back, oh, honey.  Go, oh, thank you for the wedding.  Thanks for the honeymoon.  I need the comedy Seinfeld penis.  Yeah, take it, honey.  If I was this clown, I'd try to crack Jerry in the head.  Yeah, you want the whore?  Take the whore.  And you, gee, take that which you do, huh?  I'd kick him right where it counts.  Right in his little Costanza.  Little bald-headed Costanza, huh? 
[01:19:30]  Whore!  Wow, there's no dice for stopping by.  And they quite, well, the show needed it today, huh?  You need a little comedy, and this is topical.  Hatch in the noose.

It's going to the diner for some good table.  Huh?  You pissed the sugar penis.  Yeah, piss it.  Yeah.  Huh?  Yeah, take mine with cream, all right?  Hey, eey. 
[01:20:30]  Oh.  Take eey.  Hey, Dice, do you dress up the Seinfeld penis like anything special?  Do you dress it like George?  Except with the glasses, it's a monocle.  Because it's the one-eyed George, huh?  With his friends, the balls.  They're going out for coffee.  I dress mine up in a little dice jacket.  Hey, eey. 
[01:21:00]  Obi.  What is it going to take for us to piss you off to the point where you're going to change the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony.  Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  Obi and Anthony.  He just received a Ph.D. in stupidity.  One, oh, two, seven.  All righty.  It is the worst of Opie and Anthony.  What's happening, man?  This is Rick, the producer of the show, hanging in with you guys all this week.

What do you think the QVC guy sounds like selling virgins or 22-year-olds?  Virgins.  We talked about the guys from QVC before. 
[01:22:30]  They're always selling the Beanie Babies and memorabilia sports stuff.  Yeah, they have the tough-sounding voices.  Oh, the guy.  One guy yelling all the time, virgins, 22-year-old virgins.  Order now.  These are going to go fast.  Look at this one.  Let's bring it up.  Let's open her up.  We like to do this every so often.

[01:24:30]  Reverend Al, I didn't know you were going to make a visit to our show today.  I am plugging my website.  Yeah, I see that.  Yeah, hallelujah.  We've entered cyberspace where we are not victims of racism.  There ain't no race in cyberspace.  My website is presently under construction like the Apollo Theater.  Yeah, Anthony.  I need your contributions, please. 
[01:25:00]  So crawl out from the pressure you're under and email Reverend Al, your credit card number.  No justice, no peace.  Yeah, I hear that.  This is a wonderful website that I have.  Well, tell us a little bit about it.  Well, if the cops shoot up your house, tell Reverend Al with a click of the mouse.  It's going to be a nerve center of the community.  That's right.  Even if you're in jail, you can get Reverend Al email. 
[01:25:30]  Praise the law.  Reverend Al's in cyberspace.  I also have my line of hair care products and shellac online that you can purchase.  It comes in the same bottle, so don't be discouraged.  Okay.  You can also download my spinning medallion screensaver.  It's a wonderful screensaver, that big Volkswagen hubcap medallion you always see your Reverend Al wear.  Well, I'm going to go do that right now. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  All right.  If one of our brothers is an Uncle Tom, report him to me at reverendal.com.  That's right, people.  Pray the Lord, Reverend Al's in cyberspace.  Hallelujah.  It's going to be a lot of fun, too, online.  Well, I hope so.  I've got online games on the reverendal.com.  I can only imagine what type of games you've got in cyberspace.  Well, you can download Tawana Raiders 3, where you guide Tawana Brawley through a maze of racist, rapists, politicians, judges, and police officers, 
[01:26:30]  all the while trying to make yourself a legitimate activist in the community.  Watch.  Let me boot that up now.  All right.  All right.  Whoa, there we go.  Whoa, look at that, Tawana.  Oh, look.  I just nailed Stephen Begonis.  Look at that.  Sorry.  Oh, there goes the DA.  Hey, look, I'm making ground now.  Oh, damn.  Damn. 
[01:27:00]  I was doing so well, but I fell into the rabble-rousing, troublemaking, race-bait-a-lying sack-pit-a-doom.  Why I always make that same mistake on my way to the Senate.  Damn.  Wow.  Well, all this fun can be yours at reverendal.com.  And that address again, www.fyd.com.  That's right.  That's right.  Praise Jesus.  No justice.  No peace.  I have been vindicated. 
[01:27:30]  All right.  There he goes, everyone.  Reverendal.  Wow.  We haven't had Reverendal on the show in a long time.  He is pumped up about that website.  He is running down the hallway right now.  Sounds like fun.  I want to play Tawana Raiders 3.  O.B. Anthony.  O.B. Anthony.  1-0-2-7.  Hey, where's the O.B. and Anthony?  Who's this?  Hey, this is Dave from South.  Dave, what do you want to hear, man?  How about the reverendal sack?  Reverendal black sea sack. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I can definitely do that, dude.  That'd be sweet.  All right.  Here it is, man.  Thanks, bro.  Now, more of the worst of O.B. and Anthony on FM Talk at 1-0-2-7.  Look who's coming through the door, Anthony.  Huh?  Reverendal coming through the door, Anthony.  Oh, really?  I think he has some commentary on the Danny Glover blocks can't get cabs in New York.  Does he?  I believe so.  Well, there's his music.  Well, there's his music.  And here he comes through the door, everyone.  Reverendal, I'm outraged. 
[01:28:30]  I am outraged.  Outraged.  Where are the lesbians?  Who gives a crap about no taxi cab?  I can't believe that Oki from Muskogee wouldn't show up in it.  What the hell's going on?  I don't know, Wes.  And Rick sounds like a goddamn pervert, man.  Yeah, he sure does.  Rick's more disgusting than the movie.  Hey, Reverendal, you want to see some white boobies?  Well, I like to stick to my black sisters. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  But what the hell?  All right.  Since she's here.  All right.  Let's see some dairy.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, baby.  Reverendal likes that.  That's why Reverendal likes coming here.  There you go.  The Ovi and Anthony show.  But I'm outraged.  Now, what are you outraged about today?  Why can't a black man get a taxi cab in New York City?  I don't know.  Our own black girl had trouble early in the program.  Yeah.  Even your Reverendal has been turned down trying to get a taxi cab.  I can't get to dinner. 
[01:29:30]  I'm out, Ray.  Reverendal's got to be fed.  Stop that car, you towelhead.  I am starting my own taxi cab service for the community.  Oh, yeah?  Reverendal's black sea cab.  Service in the Bronx in Harlem and certain parts of Brooklyn.  Unlike your white cab, Reverendal's black sea cab will not be crowned victorious.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[01:30:00]  They are modified Bradley armored fighting vehicles.  That's right.  Where comfort abounds and they can take a few rounds.  When you get in, you get a message of safety from Reverendal.  Okay.  Welcome.  Buckle up and put on your top of interest black jacket.  And remember, no shooting inside the vehicle due to ricochet.  Thank you. 
[01:30:30]  Have a nice trip.  I'll never have a black sea cab.  See, the white folks cab is equipped with, what, ample trunk space.  Your Reverendal's cab, twin 50-millimeter cannons with tracer rounds and Stinger anti-aircraft  missiles to clear the way to your destination.  That's right.  Reverendal's black sea cab, our motto, the engine's loud and the pain is faded, but sit back and 
[01:31:00]  relax where Alma played it.  So I'll be bringing those into the community very shortly if you send your donations to  Reverendal at the Palo Theater in Harlem.  Thank you.  I am Al Ray.  All right.  There he goes.  Reverendal, everyone.  Where's that Southern hit bitch?  Take your top off.  I am Al Ray.  There he goes.  Reverendal.  Boy, he's angry.  He's a little angry, Reverendal. 
[01:31:30]  I think he's more angry about the prude not getting top.  Well, who wouldn't be?  Okay.  That brings the races together, doesn't it?  He's going to know we can agree on something, right, Anthony?  Absolutely.  All right.  Who comes running when the cops get out of hand?  Who thinks the mayor's in the cool club's playing?  Yelling and screaming as he's speaking to a mob. 
[01:32:00]  He wears expensive suits, but he doesn't have a job.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Please go pal.  Reverend Al.  Well, he's sashing off the people in his own community.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  He's got a fat belly and his head's full of grease.  We hear his battle cry.  No justice, no peace.  The man with a plan who you know you can trust. 
[01:32:30]  The faulty little reverend with a catcher's like a bus.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  He looks like James Brown with too many calories.  Now why is the white man always picking on me?  You've never heard he gets in the brawdy case.  Turn on the TV.  You would always see his face.  He's feeding in his limo to another homicide. 
[01:33:00]  To make the network news with the family by his side.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's your pal.  Reverend Al.  Why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  I'm reverend Al.  He's reverend Al.  I'm reverend Al.  He's on his ground.  I'm hungry.  He's reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He will represent your family and he doesn't charge a fee. 
[01:33:30]  Not as long as the footage makes it on the TV.  Reverend Al.  I'm reverend Al.  He's reverend Al.  I'm your pal.  He's your pal.  That's right, reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He's the raised face, white cake, bag of Spallone.  Now why is the white man always picking on me?  Reverend Al.  Yeah, I'm out.  He's reverend Al.  I'm reverend Al.  He's your pal.  I'm your pal.  Reverend Al.  Reverend Al. 
[01:34:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Yes, we get these illiterates off the air, please.  We suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  One, oh, two, seven.  All righty, this is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  First day of the week.  It's Monday.  A couple days after Christmas.  Hopefully everybody had a good Christmas.  New Year's is coming up this year.  Let's see if Puffy and Jennifer can stay out of jail.  What asses. 
[01:34:30]  Jesus Christ.  It says enough about society, huh?  The black guy and the Puerto Rican chick on the jail.  For gun possession.  Oh.  What can you do?  Any house the worst of Opie and Anthony?  Any request for the show?  212-757-1027.  We'll see if we can hook you up.  Got tons of requests for this one.  Tons.  Well, the most requested bits for today are basically any worst of.  It's Dreamweaver.  That's right, by request.  So let's get it done now, shall we? 
[01:35:00]  The Dreamweaver bit on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talks at 1027.  It used to pick up a little CB horse.  This is.  Come on, man.  Remember the big CB radio craze?  I was like in my early teens.  And it was a way to get girls, you know?  Yeah.  Okay. 
[01:35:30]  Breaker 1-9.  Go ahead, good buddy.  Yeah.  Breaker for a radio chick.  You're coming in 4-by-4, good buddy.  Thank you.  And then you're sitting there like, what else can I say?  Come back.  I'm 10-10-10-8 on the side waiting for you, good buddy.  There.  Because I didn't drive, so what was the use?  You're just sitting in there.  It can't be like, you know.  I'm double nickels all the way. 
[01:36:00]  Looking out for the Smokies.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  We got some pretty seat covers here today.  Down the old black pack.  Keeper between the ditches.  Good buddy.  Yeah, well, all right.  I did that.  What else can I say?  I'm just on the CB.  What was your handle, Ant?  Oh, I got to explain this.  This just never, explaining never works on this show, does it? 
[01:36:30]  I was living in California at the time, and I was very equestrian.  I had a horse, and I used to ride, and my handle, because I ran a rent string.  This guy I knew had a rent string, so he used to take these Marines from Camp Pendleton that  wanted to be a cowboy for the weekend, and guide them up in the hill.  So I was like the guide.  And I'd take them up there, and then go back down the hill and get the next batch and bring 
[01:37:00]  them up.  And so I was the wrangler with you.  Hey, good buddy.  You got the wrangler.  Good buddy.  The foot wrangler.  Ah, shut up.  What was your handle?  Diamond Dust.  Diamond Dust?  That's worse than.  What's Diamond Dust? 
[01:37:30]  That's worse than Butt Wrangler?  It wasn't Butt Wrangler.  It was the wrangler.  A wrangler was a guy on a horse that got together the livestock.  Diamond Dust?  I don't know.  Hey, you got the Diamond Dust.  Hello, Diamond Dust.  Butt plug, you out there?  Good buddy?  Go ahead with your little cute story.  Why?  Got your guns on?  Ah! 
[01:38:00]  This here's a rubber duck.  A rubber duck.  What's it?  Big Ben, come on.  You shake the trees, I'll rake the leaves, good buddy.  Big Ben, for sure, for sure.  Oh, my God.  Clean, clear, flight time.  Oh, God.  Oh, shut this off.  Yeah, we definitely got the front door, good buddy.  We got us a convoy.  I was a kid looking for chicks.  Were you in a roller skate?  Hey, it's a chick in a roller skate. 
[01:38:30]  Uh-oh.  All right.  Hey, take her down to Double Nickels up by the interstate, good buddy.  We got a Kojak with a Kodak.  Good buddy taking pictures, giving away invitations.  I'll be back.  I got to go 10-100.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you see any Tijuana taxis out there?  We got us a Tijuana taxi. 
[01:39:00]  Oh, I just got passed by a crazy man on a cross rocket.  You better watch out for the smokies.  All right, come on, everybody.  All right, all right.  Meet you up at the Chokin' Pukes.  All right, the Wrangler.  Well, explain the rest of your story.  So then there was this girl that I used to communicate with on the Citizens Band, and her handle was Dreamweaver. 
[01:39:30]  You dick.  Rick had to get the song and everything.  Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver, this is the Wrangler you got your ears on.  And she sounded hot.  Yeah.  So I invited her down to ride horses.  It's a key, ladies and gentlemen.  She sounded hot.  What do you look like, Kevin? 
[01:40:00]  Oh, shut up.  All right, go.  So I was all excited for my little date, and I saddled up my horse and the other horse and kind of shut up.  The Dreamweaver, I'll meet you down at the stable.  At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, this is the Wrangler.  Over and out.  Dreamweaver.  The whole side.  You're an ass, man.  I believe we can't. 
[01:40:30]  I believe we can't.  So, all right, so I saddle up my horse, and I spend time, you know, brushing the horses, making sure they look all good and everything.  And I saddle up the other horse, and I take the reins and put her on the saddle horn, and I'm kind of trailering the other horse, you know, down to meet her by the river bed where we were going to ride.  Well, she comes walking up, and I see kind of in the distance, and I'm like, okay, that must be her. 
[01:41:00]  All right, now, wait, wait.  Now, you did say that you had the 10 and everything, and you're hoping to score in the woods, right?  Yeah, yeah.  I packed, like, a whole thing, saddlebags are all packed up with a couple of beers, and I have bedrolls and a tent just in case things went well, because we had a bunch of hills to ride up in and stuff.  I'm going to camp out with my Dreamweaver.  Dreamweaver, tell your mom you're going to be spending the night, Dreamweaver.  Tell her you're at a friend's house, because we're going to camp out. 
[01:41:30]  This is the Wrangler.  Over and out.  10-10-10-8.  On the side, Dreamweaver.  Looking forward to my little day.  Well, she comes up.  Even before I was gravely disappointed, the horse that had a carrier looked pissed.  I wasn't sure if I should take the saddle off of the horse, put it on her, and let the horse ride her.  Dreamweaver.  She was huge. 
[01:42:00]  Dreamweaver.  Yes, I was gravely disappointed.  So, Dreamweaver, are you a Wrangler?  Yes. 
[01:42:30]  Please don't be Dreamweaver.  I'm Dreamweaver.  All right, let's go for a ride.  So, we went, like, up and down the riverbed for about an hour.  I was like, oh, look at the time.  Here I had, like, bedrolls on the back of this thing.  It was like I was pawingles going up to a walnut grove.  I was going to go over the river for a week to go get supplies for the family.  I mean, I had this thing packed out, like a pack mule.  You were ready to rock.  I was like a prospector. 
[01:43:00]  I had crap hanging off the horses.  Oh, look at the time.  You were ready to rock.  Oh, ready to rock.  Good Dreamweaver.  I had firearms.  I was going to hunt for food.  Then I realized looking at it, I'd need to beg a moose.  So, you know.  Yeah, we used to hunt.  We'd hunt little rabbits and stuff.  Feeding her would forget about it.  Gee, okay.  No, there's not many bison left on the plane.  I could live off your thigh for a couple of weeks.  I can't breathe. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, it was horrid.  I was so disappointed because she's talking that she, you know.  Oh, yeah.  I look like Tatum O'Neill.  Yeah, sure you do.  Great.  So, I let her, you know, I let her off.  She rode off into the distance.  You didn't do the drive-by?  How are you going to do a drive-by on horseback?  Well, I'm the only guy with two horses, one empty.  Are you a wrangler?  No.  No, just looking for another girl. 
[01:44:00]  You should have tried to, like, meet her in town or something.  Did the drive-by.  The whole thing was riding up like Clint's friggin' Eastwood, dude.  I understand that.  I had the whole look.  You've got to remember something.  I'm a kid.  I'm, like, maybe 13 years old.  And this was mid-70s.  I had cowboy attire on.  Believe me.  This was in San Juan Capistrano, California.  A very equestrian town.  Used to ride.  This was what we did, you know. 
[01:44:30]  And I'm like, you know, I had firearms on me.  I swear to God, I had a pistol, just in case I had to fight for her honor, for any bandoleros.  Meanwhile, they'd have been, you keep her.  They'd no honor.  Maybe she could pull the wagon.  Oh, man.  But this was like, I was so pumped up for this, and so was she.  Pumped up.  But, yeah, it was very disappointing. 
[01:45:00]  But, to bring it all back to the beginning of the story, she was a girl.  All right.  I haven't laughed at her in a while.  My eyes are teared.  The song brings back memories every time I hear it.  I've got to tell you, to this day, when I hear Dreamweaver, I think of the whole day,  how happy I was and psyched and how disappointed I was running back to the ranch that day.  Oh, that's funny.  All right.  Very good story.  Thank you.  You're welcome.  It's beyond moronic.  What's up, moronic? 
[01:45:30]  O.P.S.  1-0-2-7.  George Steinbrenner, was he drunk?  What's the matter?  Oh, it's not the old boss of all.  In 1978, we wanted to crack some skulls and fire someone.  I want to remember the George Steinbrenner like the little claymation figure in the Lipton  Ice-T commercial.  Yeah.  Where it's like, you know, where the babe is like, all right, that ain't good, Reg.  You know?  And he fires Billy Martin. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  You're, Billy, you're fired.  Yeah.  That's the old George.  Not this whining, blubbering, blubbering, I don't know what he was.  Well, can I give my analogy again?  What did George look like last night?  He looked like the retarded kid at the fair after you just told the retarded kid that he  can't have another corn dog.  Did you see him staring at the Big World Series trophy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the best team ever. 
[01:46:30]  And what about him crying because what's his name?  He's given him the trophy and he's known him for so long.  To accept it from you, this man I've known for so long.  He was a mess.  And you know who he looked like?  Yeah.  Corky.  Like Corky grows up.  He's going to look just like Steinbrenner did last night.  Like Corky from Life Goes On.  Yeah.  We don't want to watch TV. 
[01:47:00]  We won the World Series.  Give me the shiny trophy.  Give me it to me.  We're the champions.  Champions of the baseball.  We win.  Give me the trophy.  My name is Georgie.  They call me Georgie.  I undertake the Yankee.  I'm the winner of the Yankee.  Winner of the baseball.  Corky Steinbrenner.  I felt bad for him.  He looked all weird.  Yeah. 
[01:47:30]  His face was all distorted.  I told you we won the World Series.  Best football game.  All right, George.  Take the trophy.  I love this beautiful diamond gear.  Georgie.  It's okay, Georgie.  To top it off, he's dressed like crazy.  Did you see him?  He's got the white turtleneck and the blazer.  The Yankees are insane. 
[01:48:00]  Crazy Georgie.  We're practically giving them away.  Take Bernie Williams.  Take the stadium.  I'm giving it all away.  I'm insane.  I'm giving it all away.  I'm giving it all away.  We win the baseball game.  Oh, my baby.  George.  My man.  Big club.  We win the baseball game.  I got.  My name is George. 
[01:48:30]  I am the Yankee, we win the best one game.  We win the best one game.  We win the best one game.  You can't hold up to me.  We win the best one.  My name is George.  I am the Yankee.  We win the best one game.  We win the best one game.  Man, I'm not in the field all the way. 
[01:49:00]  You're a mess.  My name is George.  We win the best one game.  Corky Steinbrenner.  Hi, N.E.W.  Oh, hi.  I just have to tell you guys the best.  You are so hysterically funny.  I'm not wanting to make any fun of retarded people,  but that was hysterical.  You're making fun of George.  I know, but, you know.  And it's early after you after the first person that complains about that.  It's coming, trust me. 
[01:49:30]  I know.  All right.  Opie, love that laugh.  Oh, thank you.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  We win the best one game.  Have a condo, please.  Give me a card.  I'm a condo.  I'm a condo.  I can't even believe these morons. 
[01:50:00]  Opie.  He's a disgusting little man.  And Anthony. 
[01:50:30]  What a douchebag.  Greenwreck radio.  Ben Goldberg.  This is sicker than faces of death.  You deserve the best.  But that'd be a lot of work.  Here's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1027.  It's time we can talk about O.J. real fast.  Yeah, O.J. back in the news, huh?  With a 911 call.  Let's check out the 911 call. 
[01:51:00]  All right.  Hey, Harry, police and fire.  Where's your emergency?  We have a problem here.  I'm trying to get a girl to go to rehab.  I've been doing drugs with Patriot Guerrero.  Yes.  Anybody there need to rest here?  I've been doing drugs for two days with Patriot Guerrero.  We just got arrested.  Okay.  I'm trying to get her to peeve her out and go in the rehab right now.  Is anybody hitting anyone right now?  No, it's not going to.  Anybody have any weapons?  No.  Does the girl be in the drug?  No.  That's my favorite.  Anybody have any weapons? 
[01:51:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Not this time.  Not this time.  She had to ask if anyone was getting hit or hurt or if he has weapons.  Does the woman have another mouth under her mouth now that's really bloody?  No, not this time.  I've got to hear that again.  It's like cocaine, and I'm trying to get her to peeve her out and go in the rehab right now.  Is anybody hitting anyone right now?  Anybody have any weapons?  No, no, no, no.  She didn't arrest you.  No, she doesn't arrest you.  I'm like, I'm fine. 
[01:52:00]  I'm afraid I'm trying to tell her.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Now, don't get started on that again.  No, no.  No weapons.  That's in the golf bag.  I mean, I don't know where the knife is.  That's in a lake in Chicago.  Don't make me get on a plane.  Oh, I cut my knuckle on the 9 when I was dialing 911.  That's where the blood's from.  I swear.  Where's Robert Kardashian?  Help me, please.  It's like, no.  What at all?  No, no, no. 
[01:52:30]  Don't think that.  No, no.  If anyone hurt need rescue.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I love.  Don't make me get the Bronco.  Now, what does he do?  Does he call 911 back?  Oh, no.  911 calls his home, I believe.  I guess they were disconnected or something, and then 911 usually calls back.  Okay, so here's the section.  Hello, O.J.  How's...  Oh, boy, I want you to call the police.  Hello? 
[01:53:00]  This is the deuce.  Now, what happened?  I don't know.  You hear O.J. going, I want you to call the police.  I had to hit her over the head with the phone receiver, and we just disconnected.  I like him.  Hello?  This is the police department.  No, she left, and I don't know what to do about it.  I'm frustrated.  This guy, Pedro Guerrero, got arrested for having 15 keys of cocaine here recently.  This girl has spent the last two days doing drugs with him. 
[01:53:30]  Me and a friend just came over and said, you're going into a rehab.  She got mad.  She just got in her car.  She drives a Mercedes.  She lives in the car seats.  Now, she is loaded out of her mind.  Get her Mustang driving around town.  What other door driver's license number, but she needs to be stopped.  What other's a Mustang?  It's white.  Like a Bronco.  Is she black and white?  She's a white girl.  Okay, thank you.  I got to go and see if I can find her.  Okay. 
[01:54:00]  That's all I need, a white girl.  This has got to be a comedy routine.  I believe Al Cowling's driving.  O.J., call 911.  Is O.J. putting out a prank call tape?  Is that what's going on here?  The best of O.J.  Right.  I call 911 around the country.  Get my 911 comedy tape.  O.J. calls 911.  Hello, 911?  911 operator.  Is your refrigerator running there? 
[01:54:30]  Yes, it is.  Well, you better catch it.  911?  911, what's your emergency?  Hello.  Do you have Prince Albert in the can?  What do you mean?  Do you have Prince Albert in the can?  Yes, we do.  Well, you better let him out before he suffocates.  That's the O.J. Simpson 911 comedy tape.  Order yours now. 
[01:55:00]  He's a big old man.  Hello.  Is this 911?  Yes.  Do you have 10-pound balls?  Yes, we do.  How do you walk?  You skip the best of O.J. Simpson.  I got to go now.  I got to find her.  He's all concerned.  Man, is he bored, huh? 
[01:55:30]  Oh, man.  I was hoping he would do it with the famous butt plug.  I call it.  Hello, 911?  911?  Yes.  I'm looking for Michael Hunt.  Is he there?  He goes by the name of Mike.  He's lost along with your favorite murderer, O.J.  911?  911?  911?  911? 
[01:56:00]  Yes.  Uh, butt plug.  Bug box?  Butt plug.  What are you looking for?  Butt plug.  Butt plug.  Don't make me cut your throat, mother...  Does O.J. do any, like, character voices on his prank call tape?  Kind of like the jerky voices?  I'll come down there with my toolbox. 
[01:56:30]  I'll bash your head in with a ratchet.  Aw, nice.  I'm O.J.  Oops, I just cut myself on a piece of foam rubber.  I better fly to Chicago.  Oh, man.  That's the O.J. Simpson 911 comedy tape.  Order yours now.  Friggin' O.J. 
[01:57:00]  Man, he's back.  He's back.  Thank God.  It's kind of like a car wreck in the highway.  You're going to have to, you know, take a sense to see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  O.B.  And Anthony.  We refuse to be responsible.  So don't screw yourself.  We refuse to be responsible.  One, two, ten.  Hello?  Hello.  How you doing?  Okay.  You're calling about the job.  Right.  What's your experience in this field?  I worked for a landscaper for like three years. 
[01:57:30]  And before that, you know, I mowed the lawn at my house and stuff.  Yeah.  I did the, you know, the edging.  The last job I was on, I did the edger.  And I did the bushes with the clippers.  You know how to work that big blower thing?  I never got to use that thing, the blower.  No.  But you know how to trim bush.  I know how to trim the bushes.  And I know how to work the edger thing.  What's the biggest bush you've ever trimmed?  Pretty big.  Was it like a 70s Earth Mama Moth? 
[01:58:00]  Like a what?  70s Earth Mama Moth.  It's a little lingo in the business.  I'm sorry.  Like a hedge.  I don't know what they were called.  Was it like a bush that was shaped in like the shape of like a Hitler mustache?  Like a Hitler mustache?  No.  Yeah.  Like a hedge, you know.  No.  Like big though.  Like round.  It was like a nice landing strip.  Like whenever anything custom had to do, my boss did it, Manny.  Can you handle the big cans?  What?  Carrying stuff?  Yeah.  We fill them up and put them in the truck. 
[01:58:30]  You know what I mean?  Like handling the big cans.  Yeah.  I can carry that stuff.  I carry anything.  So you're good with cans?  Yeah.  Then you're good at blowing?  I told you.  I never did the blowing machine.  But you're willing to learn how to blow?  Yeah.  Oh.  That's very nice.  All right.  Good.  Yeah, I'll blow.  I'll probably use that.  Where do I go down?  Like do I have to fill out an application or anything?  Or mail something in?  Says something here about an address.  Yeah, you got the address there?  Yeah.  Okay, good, good. 
[01:59:00]  And what's your name?  Can I get your name?  Yeah, John Huber.  All right, John.  Yeah, my name's John Toad.  Yeah, if you could possibly maybe, I don't know, put some of the bush clippings in an envelope  and send it in, that would help us out to see what type of bush you've been trimming.  In an envelope?  Should I bring it down there or just put it in an envelope?  Yeah, just mail it to the address, actually.  What's some of your, you know?  What, different ones or just one type?  Your qualifications.  Actually, what I would do is make like a collage, you know, with all the bush you've 
[01:59:30]  trimmed over the years, if you still had that laying around.  Right.  And, um...  If I don't have a laying around, I don't take the crap home.  Well.  Well, you know, we have higher-ups, too, and they just want to see some kind of, you know,  foliage.  So if I get cardboard...  Yeah, get some cardboard.  And glue like the different things on it and just put it in one of them big envelopes  so I can mail it in and you can check it out?  Yeah, and just like label, you know, which is which.  All the different bushes that I've done?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Mail it in there?  Should I put my name and any other experience? 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, like, uh...  Yeah, put your name and a phone number and we can reach you.  So we'll take a look at your work and then we'll call you back.  All right.  It's going to be a pretty big piece of cardboard, though.  We're looking at, uh, you know, three feet by about three feet.  All right.  I don't know if that's going to run to mail, but...  All right, John?  Three foot.  Yeah.  Three foot by three foot.  Like a big, like one of the things from school, like construction paper, like the old pegs?  Yeah.  Can I fold it?  Oh, no.  That affects the, uh, the foliage.  All right.  Actually.  Yeah.  Just find a big envelope. 
[02:00:30]  All right.  If you want, you can bring it down personally.  Just, uh, go to the address on the ad there.  Okay.  All right?  All right.  Your name's John?  Yeah.  Just look for me.  All right, John.  All right, man.  All right.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  All right.  Come on.  I couldn't hold it in.  Come on.  That can't be real.  No way.  There's no way that could be real.  That was a put-on.  No one could be that stupid.  If it, if that was real, we'd just talk to the stuporst man alive. 
[02:01:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Someone get this pen out of my nose.  1027.  All right.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  What's happening, man?  This is, uh, Rick, the producer of the show, hanging with you on today's, uh, worst of.  Any suggestions?  I've got, uh, a few spots to fill here.  Make sure you give a call.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We'll see if we can get those on for you.  Spaz is working the fogs.  Try not to run into the door this time, Spaz, all right? 
[02:01:30]  This freaking kid ran straight into the door.  Unbelievable.  Later on, we still have, uh, Mad Dog with Jeter and Piazza coming up.  Anthony and the beautiful people.  We'll throw in some bits here and there.  And, uh, looking for more requests.  So make sure you give a call.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We will try and get them on for you.  In the meantime, take a quick, uh, music break.  Remember, in between any song, or any two songs, always a bit. 
[02:02:00]  All right?  So don't go anywhere.  Here's Pearl Jam.  Any W.  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1-0-2-7.  The talk you can't ignore.  This is the story of six strangers.  Hit to live together in a house and have their lives taped.  Find out what happens when they stop being polite and start getting tiny.  Real-world Midget Town.  Listen, Binky, I don't like it when you talk down to me.  You belittle me.  You make me feel two feet tall. 
[02:02:30]  Well, I have some news for you, Chi-Chi.  You are two feet tall!  Misha used to work in a circus.  And he's all like, oh, I used to ride on a pony.  And I used to drive a wind-up Volkswagen.  And I'm like, Midget, get over yourself.  I think the problem here is that they're all a little jealous of me.  Because I come from the entertainment industry.  I was in the circus.  I don't know if I mentioned that to you.  And also, for a number of years, I played Snuggles, the fabric softener bear. 
[02:03:00]  And what you need to understand is that going to Six Flags Great Adventure is a waste.  We're dwarves.  We can't get on any of the friggin' rides.  Well, that's where you're wrong, Chi-Chi.  Because we can do a lot at Great Adventure.  We can get on that thing that looks like a worm.  It goes in a circle.  It's like a worm wearing a hat.  It's like a green plastic thing.  But it goes in a circle.  It goes up and down a little bit.  We can get on that.  We can get on the boats.  Little boats.  You know those boats?  They go in a circle around in a little pool of water there.  And they have bells on the front of them.  They have bells.  And if you pull on the string, you can ring the bell. 
[02:03:30]  So, so shut up.  Hey, what are you guys doing?  Um, we were just going to go out and throw rocks at people.  You know, for staring at us.  That sounds good.  Sounds like a lot of fun.  Uh, by the way, I'm gay.  Whoa.  That really caught me off guard.  I didn't know if he was gay.  Because I thought I was gay.  But I really wasn't sure.  So when he said, I'm gay, I'm like, put that together with being a midget.  I got enough on my plate here.  That's tonight on Real World Midget Town.  Opie and Anthony.  Oh, those guys are fast! 
[02:04:00]  One, two, seven.  Opie.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Anthony.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of footies.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  Better leave a bruise.  One, two, seven.  Uh, Ant was hanging out with the beautiful people last night.  Boy, was I out of place.  What the hell are you hanging out with the beautiful people?  You see it in the paper all the time.  These, like, big to-do parties.  Parties, sure, sure.  You see all the celebrities, you know. 
[02:04:30]  Why didn't the paparazzi get a picture of you?  I think they got a picture of Madonna.  You were at the same party as Madonna last night, dude.  I'm moving and shaking, dude.  Yeah, where's the article?  This isn't the Anthony I know.  Well, first of all, I was stood up by Rick and Ben.  Well, fine.  We were supposed to go to the party, right?  We were all going to go and just goof on, everybody, everything.  It was a party for Mark Dolan, Details Magazine.  His first issue under his leadership. 
[02:05:00]  Mm-hmm.  It's so funny.  I mean, the pomp and circumstance, the whole big laser light show outside the place, lights, the music.  Pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft, pfft.  We were hanging with Puff Daddy.  Oh, it was good.  Was Puff Daddy there, Anthony?  You and the beautiful people?  Well, the beautiful people got to go right in.  Oh, really?  Yeah, like cars are pulling up, and there's a guy there with a headset and everything,  and he's undoing the velvet rope and letting people in.  I'm like, oh, this must be the line for the people that know Mark Dolan. 
[02:05:30]  That's me.  And then he starts.  This isn't the line, people.  Gasless line is around here.  A big line of schlubs.  So I get on that line.  The only consolation was on the same line as me.  Remember the movie Clerks?  Yeah, of course.  The guy that was in that J?  Smoking weed.  Smoking weed.  Drinking beer.  Doing coke.  He was on that line, and so was the other guy from Clerks.  I'm not even supposed to be here.  That guy?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, they were on the same schlub line I was on. 
[02:06:00]  So then, you know, get inside.  What, what, what, what, what, what?  What?  You look puzzled.  Yeah, what were you doing waiting on a line, dude?  I had set up for you to walk right in.  No, that's the line to walk right in.  It was a line to walk right in.  The short line?  Were you on the short line or the long line?  No, there was one line, and then there was the guy at the velvet rope letting the people  in from the limos.  All right, well, you're supposed to go up and tell them, ask for the name I gave you, and  you would have been walked right in.  You shouldn't have been waiting on a line.  You know what's worse than waiting on a line? 
[02:06:30]  Walking up to the guy, telling him how you're supposed to get right in, and having him send  you to the line.  That looks real embarrassing.  Oh, how embarrassing.  I don't do that.  So you know what?  I stood on the line.  Right.  Who cares?  I don't care.  So did you get into the party?  How long did you have to wait outside?  Not long.  It was like five minutes.  It wasn't long.  Did you get your picture with Madonna?  No, there were people there.  Oh, and Paltrow was there, Anthony.  I saw that guy from the gossip show on E! with the caterpillar over his eyebrows. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, the guy looks like Martin Scorsese?  George Whipple, I guess his name is.  Yeah, I know who you're talking about.  Yeah, the big guy, and he was there with his camera crew and stuff.  And then, you know, I see Mark Golan say, hi, nice party, where's the bar?  And of course, he knew right away.  So they're mixing some pretty strong drinks there, too, I've got to tell you.  Had a couple of absolutes and orange juice.  Sure.  Loosen up so I could mingle with the beautiful people.  Sure.  Yeah.  You're changing, man.  God, shut up. 
[02:07:30]  Why are you hanging with these people?  I was supposed to meet Rick and Ben there, and we were going to goof on there.  I never thought I'd see the day that Ant would be hanging with the beautiful people.  You're at the same party as Madonna.  What is going on with you, man?  And I saw Lisa Ling from The View.  Yeah.  I didn't want to say anything to her, just in case she heard any Star Jones comments.  And then...  Are you networking, Anthony?  Oh, I'm moving and shaking.  Are you going to be on The View soon?  Shut up. 
[02:08:00]  I saw Michael Buffer, the let's get ready to rumble guy.  Yeah.  And then the biggest celebrity of them all comes in.  Not Madonna.  No.  Gwyneth Paltrow?  She was there.  No?  Not her?  No, no, no.  I didn't see her or Madonna.  Okay.  They must be in the back back room where it's a sludge like me and not allowed to go.  No.  Gary Coleman.  Gary Coleman.  Comes in.  All of a sudden, I just see this little short black guy walk by.  I was like, oh, my God, look, it's Gary Coleman. 
[02:08:30]  And then all the brothers, like there are a bunch of hip-hop guys there and stuff, are  around Gary Coleman shaking his hand but laughing.  They're like, yeah, look, it's my ass of Gary Coleman.  Look at you, shot him in it.  Come here, love him.  You know, and they're all like goofing on him.  And he turned around and like walked right out again.  All right, I've got to put someone in their place.  Michelle, what's up?  Opie, I think you're going to go to Anthony.  No.  Why would you say that?  Because you got to hang out with the beautiful people and you didn't.  Michelle, let me set you straight, okay? 
[02:09:00]  Both of us were invited to the party.  It was a no-brainer for me to say, no, thank you.  Why?  Because I didn't want to go.  I don't like hanging out at those places.  You think I go to hang out?  First of all, I just wanted to say congratulations and hello to a good friend of the show, Mark  Dolan.  Right.  You don't think it would be fun to hang out with me and Rick and Ben and goof on the New  York club?  All right.  If we had our little gang together and we had a corner table and we could goof on all 
[02:09:30]  the beautiful people.  Yeah, but you went by yourself.  I didn't know I was going by myself.  We all blew off the party and you still went.  I didn't know.  That's what makes me go, what the heck is that all about?  You do make a good point.  If we had our little group of guys together and we were at a table, yeah, I would have  loved it because then we could have goofed on everything.  Yeah.  That's what those are all about.  What do you think?  I'm going there to mingle with people?  There were so many look-alike people.  You're walking around and it's like, oh my God, here it is.  Were you smoking cigars with Arnold Schwarzenegger and stuff? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, that's what I was doing.  I was just networking.  There were a whole bunch of JFK Jr. look-alikes.  Hey, Joe.  Why wouldn't you want to go there last night?  There's probably a lot of rich chicks there, you know?  I don't.  It's not my scene.  Oh, and it's mine.  Come on.  Get her message.  All right.  And it's mine?  That's what I'm trying to say.  Come on.  I think Ant and I are kind of like going our own way, man.  What are you on, drugs?  It used to that both of us would blow this off. 
[02:10:30]  It wasn't our scene.  But I guess it's now Anthony's scene.  What can I tell you?  Is he selling out, Opie?  I think he's selling out.  He's got this.  I'm selling out.  He's sitting here across from me.  He's got one of those shiny black suits on now.  His nose up in the air, right?  Come on.  He's got a supermodel waiting for him outside the studio.  All right.  He's left me behind.  What can I say?  You're in New York.  All of a sudden, he's a star now, right?  Right.  You know?  So much for the days of just getting hammered at the local pubs. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  That's my scene.  You should have seen how out of place.  Like Earl at a Klan meeting.  That's how out of place I was.  Believe me.  And you sure you have enough time to go to the Yankee game with us tonight?  Or do you have one of these little...  There's a squire A to go to.  Gwyneth and Madonna.  I think Esquire Magazine is having a party tonight.  You go to that?  You're a tool, man.  I can't believe it.  Are you hoping the Yankees, you know, score early so they can leave for another shindig?  Maybe you'll get on the fashion show with Joe Rivers, Anthony. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, I enjoy the hat and the ponytail.  But the T-shirts.  You ought to do something different.  Anthony on the red carpet.  Is that what your goal is?  Is that what your goal is, Anthony?  Shut up, you jerk.  Listen to you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Have a good day.  All right.  All right.  Here they come.  I got to tell you.  More gay guys at this party.  Gay guys than I've ever seen in my life.  Holy smoke.  You couldn't turn around in two seconds without two guys in a lip lock. 
[02:12:00]  George.  Oh, Ed, man.  What's going on?  You're leaving your boy behind.  He should have come to this party.  I didn't want to go.  Crying, man.  No.  Which one is this good thing?  You don't bring me flowers anymore.  You know, it was supposed to be one of those things where we go to and, like, just hang out and goof.  Did you do any blow with any of these top-notch celebrities, Anthony?  Oh, if I was packing my face with cocaine, free cocaine was just flowing like crazy. 
[02:12:30]  No, I wasn't doing drugs.  So we're all scared.  A lot of the faithful listeners are even scared.  They're thinking, Anthony might be becoming a sellout now.  Well, Eddie's going to be spending more time with the beautiful people instead of us.  If you saw how out of place I was at this shindig, it was retarded.  The health looked better than I did at this party.  Believe me.  By the way, Ant, your invitation for that puffy party came.  Oh, good.  See?  Please.  Tell him an RSVP for me, would you, Rick?  Were you hanging with Albie Shore last night, Anthony? 
[02:13:00]  Don, what's up?  What's up?  I just want to know if Anthony's going to start changing the show a little bit, adding in a little Madonna music, a little Michael Jackson.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's it.  My new close personal friend.  Did Madonna ask you to be?  I'm thinking, Rick.  I didn't see Madonna.  And Albie told Anthony that they were all going to go, and they're probably laughing their asses off right now.  Yeah.  And he actually went.  That's what I'm thinking.  All you guys conspired against me.  Yeah, we're all going, Ant. 
[02:13:30]  We'll meet you there.  And I walk in alone.  Ant, is it true you?  They were probably there just watching you laughing their asses off.  All right.  Got a boy.  All right.  All right, man.  Thank you, Don.  You guys suck.  Chris from Jersey writing in the instant feedback.  Anthony, man, you've changed.  It used to be about the radio show, man.  Now it's all about your fancy friends and parties and cocaine, man.  You've changed.  And is it true that you have to leave the show early today because you've got to go house hunting in the Hamptons? 
[02:14:00]  Shut up.  You guys are jackasses, man.  We could have had fun goofing on this whole thing.  Doc, what's going on?  Yeah, can I talk to Mr. High Society, please?  Is my society around?  No.  All right.  He inflows, man.  You're all a bunch of tools.  Mr. High Society now, huh?  High Society, 1027.  I love it.  It used to be we both came into work, talked about the show and stuff.  Now if I want to talk to Anthony, I've got to go through his agent. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, so I had a Chrissy Brinkley and Billy Joel for me.  I don't know how they're doing on the Hamptons over there.  Unbelievable.  I go to one little shindig.  I thought, to tell you the truth, I thought this party was going to be like the one we went to for Maxim,  which was about a year ago.  And that was more my style.  There was like no celebrities.  It was in the Maxim office, I believe.  It was like an office party.  There was a pinball machine set up and they were having a pinball tournament.  And it was a little small buffet, a tub with some beers thrown in it on ice. 
[02:15:00]  That's more my style.  I like that.  I get there last night.  There's laser lights.  It's techno frigging blasting music in this warehouse.  Dance.  Oh, yeah, Rick.  I was raising the roof.  That's it.  Me and Gwyneth were tripping the light fantastic, you frigging.  Were you doing the Mambo?  Yeah, Mambo No. 5.  That's what I was doing.  Could we go find some music for Anthony so he feels comfortable today?  Oh, man.  Can we lower the lights, too?  Yeah, we can lower the lights. 
[02:15:30]  Did you get one of Donald Trump's leftovers, Anthony?  Yeah, that's it.  That's what I was doing.  Jesus, man.  I hear Anthony's becoming a real sellout.  He's going to go make a movie now.  Now that you've made all your connections.  Yeah, I was really networking.  I'm standing in a corner like a wallflower.  Oh, yeah, that's what happened.  Sipping my drink.  Yeah, I'm sure that's how it was.  Jack, what's up?  Check his hands for a manicure, please.  And also, how gay is that situation found? 
[02:16:00]  Some guy lingering with a bunch of fags.  You made that special point to say there's the most gay people he's seen in his whole life.  I just was saying there was a lot of gay people there.  A lot of gay people.  Looking for a little action later that night?  Yeah, that's what I was doing.  Oh, you got me.  Dude, I cannot tell you how out of place I was at this shindig.  Believe me.  Yeah, we all believe you. 
[02:16:30]  Brian, what's up?  Hey, man, can I borrow some grapefruit pot or what?  I'm getting back going to all these parties.  I hope you don't change that much, man.  Yeah, I'm going to all these parties.  I was supposed to go to the details party last night with Ben and Rick,  and we were going to hang out and goof on the New York, you know, society people  and celebrity models and stuff.  I end up going there.  I'm stood up by my pals.  I'm alone at a party I had no effing business being at. 
[02:17:00]  None.  The paparazzi's there, the video cameras, the tape and the models dancing,  and, of course, they pan by.  I'm there in my busted up leather and my hat.  Hey, what's up?  Another drink, please.  Say you are changing.  You're trying to start a new trend, even.  Yeah, because they all look alike, and I, like, look different,  so they're probably, ooh, that's the new style.  Wow.  Got to dress like a slob.  Chip, let's get nuts.  Yeah.  Oh, man. 
[02:17:30]  The parties with fags?  What's that?  You going to call Richard Gere and get a couple of gerbils?  What's that?  God, I love our audience.  I've got to keep telling myself that.  And your movie deal should be coming in any day now,  and then you won't have to take this abuse from our listeners anymore.  Absolutely.  Sure thing.  You'll leave us all behind.  You'll be in California.  You know, you guys suck, man.  I was just showing support from Mark Golan.  Hey, Joe, what's up?  I get hell.  I just hope when you're in Hollywood and stuff,  and I come knocking on your door, you don't, like, kick me to the curb. 
[02:18:00]  Hey, hey, remember me?  Hey, is this the only man, Thurston Howell III?  No.  Love it.  Love it.  So you get any phone numbers?  No, I didn't talk to anybody, man.  Don't you?  I stood there.  I watched Jay from Clerks walk back and forth chasing superpowers.  You had to talk to someone.  I talked to the security guy when I was getting in.  Name?  I should be on the guest list. 
[02:18:30]  I stamped my hand.  I walked in.  That was the last person I spoke to.  Waiting on lines.  I think Studio 54 is not open anymore.  Oh, yeah.  I'd be right there.  You and Brooke do a joke in the bathroom now.  Shut up.  Dimitri.  Hello.  I danced with Anthony on the night.  You did not.  Shut up.  Yes, you did.  You grabbed my hiney.  Yeah, okay.  That's it.  That's what I was doing. 
[02:19:00]  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  Could you hang up on this guy?  Oh, this is cute.  Yeah.  You guys are the biggest a-holes.  Yeah, I was just boogying down to that.  Brian in Jersey.  Ant thinks he's some kind of rock star now.  Blowing coke with the stars.  Who the hell do you think you are?  Act gets all your new friends, the Baldwin Brothers, and we'll have a big, huge fight. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  The Park Avenue posse.  Dave, what's up?  Anthony, we're going to do lunch, babe.  What do you say?  Oh, my God.  I'm getting nailed here.  Anthony, what's up?  Mr. Anthony, please.  I just want to let you know that your limousine will be downstairs at 7 o'clock. 
[02:20:00]  Shut up.  Shut up.  We will take you anywhere you'd like to go tonight, sir, and I'll make sure we have the  carpet out for you, sir.  I think he needs to go to the Esquire party tonight.  Oh, is that where I'm booked to go?  Or is it Glamour Magazine tonight?  Where do you need a chink to hold my umbrella if it's raining?  Like Kathy Lee.  Tom and Nicole's people called.  They're all set for Sunday.  Oh, thank you, Rick, for setting that up.  That was such a goof, man. 
[02:20:30]  I go to a party that we were invited to to support Mark Golan, and I catch hell because  Madonna was there.  There's pictures all over the post.  I'm surprised you didn't get any of them.  I haven't seen any pictures yet.  There's Gwyneth Paltrow hugging Madonna.  That's the same party you were at.  What happened to going to the strip clubs after the show?  I would still go to the strip clubs.  Are you allowed to ride the subway still to the stadium tonight for the game, or do we  have to meet you out front?  Because I'm riding the damn subway. 
[02:21:00]  I'm so different.  I'm going to these parties all the time.  I'm going to helicopter you in just in time for the game?  Jesus.  How did this happen?  Or do you have to take the limo to read some movie scripts?  I mean, what the hell's going on with you?  Come on, man.  Paul, what's up?  Anthony?  Yeah.  First of all, we all know that I don't like that third-faced partners of your dopey,  okay?  We don't.  That's right off the bat.  But you, you backstab dopey.  Shame on you.  How did I backstab? 
[02:21:30]  Just yesterday, he was saying about how you guys are not like Howard.  You don't go for the approval of anybody.  Oh.  And then pushing your little you goes dancing.  And you put glitter on your hair, too, you fag.  What's the matter with you?  Come on.  What do you want to hear?  You have to point me out.  Come by, do your nails, too.  You'll chase yourself.  Shame on you.  You'll chase yourself.  Wait a minute.  You know, Paul, I don't understand why I was there.  Paul, I hate you, too, but you're pretty funny today, man.  Does anyone understand why I was there?  We're trying to understand that.  I've said it a thousand times. 
[02:22:00]  It was there because Rick and Ben were showing up, and we were going to goof on this.  If you don't understand by now, this is like an intervention.  We're a little scared.  This wasn't like it.  You've been heading in this direction for a while.  Okay.  So you think, I went to this party thinking, oh, boy, I got an invite.  This is great.  This is going to be my in to New York's high society.  I'm going to rub elbows with celebrities.  I'm going to network.  This is going to be great for me.  Right.  Or, and this will be a good goof, me, Rick, Ben, we'll hang out, we'll have some free 
[02:22:30]  drinks, and goof on the celebrities.  Which one sounds more like me?  The first one.  Shut up.  Shut up.  That is so far from the truth, man.  Yeah.  So far from the truth.  Canaro's on line seven, wants Ack in his next movie.  O.J. on line nine, was that party with Ack?  Gee, it's all out.  So when do you run for office?  You have to be famous for a few more years?  Yeah, yeah.  Then I'll do that whole thing. 
[02:23:00]  All right, all right.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  You're on to me.  Well, it's all the cats out of the bag.  I'm a big high society homo.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, to be wild.  Boo, boo, boo.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Or stupidity on the way.  Say, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  One, two, seven. 
[02:23:30]  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at one, oh, two, seven.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, hello.  Hi, what's up?  Hey, my name is Kyler.  Did it ever occur to you that you might have gay listeners who might be offended by the way you talk?  Oh, no.  Well, yeah, we know we have gay listeners, and they enjoy our show.  Yeah, well, I'm a gay listener, and I do enjoy listening.  I've listened to N.E.W. for years, but that kind of talk offends me.  What offends you, sir?  As if it's assumed, first of all, the use of the word fag and homo like that over and over again. 
[02:24:00]  Well, you're going to have to get over that.  That's what we do.  Yeah, well, you know, there are other words.  No, no, no.  We're a radio show, okay?  If you want to discuss this, then we'll discuss it, but don't curse.  Okay.  Go.  Make it sound like it's really awful that guys would think that you were gay.  Well, for a straight guy, it is.  No, it isn't.  No, it isn't.  Guys, it's human now. 
[02:24:30]  No, no, no, no, because you're gay.  See, for a straight guy, it's not good for his straight friends to think he's gay.  That's reality.  That's just the way it is.  We're not going to change that perception.  I'm sorry, but the average straight guy doesn't want to think that his pal is gay.  Yeah, but, I mean, you wouldn't use the word, you know, words like nigger.  You know, you wouldn't, you know, in a different realm.  Sir, we have used that word on this show.  We have used the word fag. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  Well, you know, it's not just the word.  We have pretty much used every derogatory term on this show.  It makes it sound really awful, and you're going to really offend gay listeners.  Honestly, let me tell you something.  I don't really care if you're gay.  I really don't.  Simple as that.  And I think if you listen to our show on a daily basis, I think people realize that.  We're just trying to have fun here.  Well, it might occur to you that, you know, there might be some college guy who is having a difficult time with it.  He hears stuff like that.  That's not very encouraging, you know. 
[02:25:30]  I personally am.  I've heard that excuse from gay guys, like, all the time, working on radio.  No.  That's the big thing.  Somebody trying to come out is going to have a difficult time with it and stuff.  You know, everybody.  You know, we live to a lot of college.  Your attitude is this, you know, like a macho bar attitude.  It's that kind of humor.  Well, that's.  And, you know, I love the music.  Don't you get it?  Well, that's what.  Oh, here it comes.  I love the music, but I don't like you guys.  There's probably some of this talk in between, you know.  Well, then, dude, you know what?  There's a million radio stations. 
[02:26:00]  Go listen to another one.  Well, that's just what I did when I heard it.  I switched.  Good.  All right.  You guys are responsible for the.  Sir, sir, let me stop you again.  We don't have a large young audience listening to our radio show.  Well, I would say that.  We have a lot of people with an open mind that then see it for what it is, which is pure humor  and trying to entertain people after a long day of work.  We don't have time to be politically correct.  We really don't.  I'm sorry.  Listen, I'm not politically correct.  You know what?  There's enough people in our society trying to be politically correct.  We're trying to balance out the scale again. 
[02:26:30]  So we're going the other way.  Let me just say a few things without being interrupted.  I'm not politically correct.  I'm not a gay activist.  Frankly, I'm not even into all that stuff.  Are you hot?  But, yeah.  They have, like, tight buns and stuff?  The thing is that, you know, I'm not into that stuff.  You know, but I'm listening to this, you know, and I'm saying, I can't believe this.  I'm calling for, you know, half an hour trying to get through.  Because we have a popular radio show because people are enjoying this and they're taking  it for what it is, just entertainment. 
[02:27:00]  That's it.  Well, what did I say?  One letter or one call is equivalent to, what, 200 opinions?  You know, keep it in mind what I'm saying.  Whether you want to fight me on it now, keep in mind what I'm saying.  Because it's...  Do you have, like, a six-pack?  And I'm not, you know, and I'm also, I'm not, I'm not overly...  Come on, just laugh, you idiot.  You know you want to laugh.  You know you want to laugh.  Laugh.  I'm not overly offended by things.  In fact, there are many, there are many gay guys and many things that I hate about gay  world.  Do you look good in gym shorts? 
[02:27:30]  Really?  I'm just talking about the way you come off, you know, and...  You're coming off like a little bitch.  No, I'm not.  No, I'm not.  I'm coming off as an adult as an adult.  Pitcher or catcher?  You know, I'm a counselor.  What do you like?  I'm a counselor for a living.  It's good to have a good time, but don't be offensive, okay?  That's my message to you, okay?  Thank you, Dad.  Yeah.  And, yeah, grow up.  Grow up?  That's the worst thing to do.  Who the hell wants to do that?  There's plenty of time to be an old, feeble jack-off on a goddamn little rascal scooter. 
[02:28:00]  But listen, listen.  When was the last time you got some?  Yeah.  Listen to this.  Come on, you want to laugh.  I hear it in your voice.  You're a gay guy, right?  It had to be last night.  Do you get any calls like this?  Am I the only one?  Do you ever say no?  Do you?  Come on, Kyler.  It's funny.  You know it is.  Come on.  There's just so many...  I've got a good sense of humor, you guys.  Do you like Judy Garland?  No, I don't.  I don't like Barbara Streisand, and I don't like Liza Minnelli. 
[02:28:30]  I like rock and roll.  That's why I listen to your station.  And I go to the Boiler Room, because it's one of the few gay bars that plays good rock and roll.  The Boiler Room.  Yeah.  What a damn...  I mean, do they have to have such stereotypical names?  It's a good place.  Go to check it out.  Go to the Boiler Room.  Do they have, like, glory holes and stuff?  No.  Is it spelt like Boiler Room?  Oh, that's a good point, but no, it's not.  No, it's not.  That'd kind of be fun if it was spelt like that.  Right.  What I'm trying to say is you make it sound like the worst thing in the world that other 
[02:29:00]  guys could think you were homos.  And so what if they did?  I mean, you guys want to give your sperm?  Great.  I mean, it sounds really hot to me, but, you know...  Wow.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Kyler, are you going to be turned on if we do this?  I was turned on on the radio?  No, I don't want to go on the radio.  I'm actually quite well known in...  Would you like to taste test?  No, not these days.  Come on, Kyler.  Are you practicing safe sex? 
[02:29:30]  Of course.  Yeah, why don't we get that...  Are you?  Why don't we get that message out to the community?  Practice safe sex.  Yeah, that's more important.  Uh-huh.  And maybe you can make it...  You can use my name.  Can I ask you how old you are?  Yeah, I'm 46.  Oh, wow.  You were in it, like, in the 70s and stuff?  Yeah, I'm very lucky.  Oh.  I'm very lucky because I'm negative.  That was a fun time for you guys, huh?  Yeah.  Just all the F-ing and S-ing.  How scary is it, though?  Scary as what?  Well, thinking you may come down with that.  I mean, you're in the high-risk category. 
[02:30:00]  I've been tested six times, and I'm negative.  But every time you get tested, aren't you just, like, completely freaking out?  Yeah, that's why I haven't done it in a long time.  Really?  But they, you see, I practice safe sex, and I don't like to receive it.  So that makes me pretty safe.  That's what us straight people call it.  Listen, you keep skirting the issue.  Your issue is, I think you should apologize.  You can use my name if you want to.  Kyler, honestly, you know, we just don't apologize for what we do on our show.  Okay.  Well, maybe...  I think... 
[02:30:30]  Say something in a funny way.  Hey, you don't mean to offend any gay guys.  But you're just having fun, you know, you don't...  Kyler, honestly, you really don't listen to our show a lot, because we have said things  like that in the past.  Okay.  No, I don't.  I don't usually listen to it.  The one thing Ant and I try to do is try to make fun of pretty much everything.  Uh-huh.  We don't focus on the gays.  We don't focus on black people.  We don't focus on this group.  We're just trying to...  We're just trying to have fun.  Okay.  And if something hits us in the news or something we saw on our way in, then we're going to  discuss it and we're going to try to make it entertaining. 
[02:31:00]  Uh-huh.  And honestly, we know every time we talk, we're offending someone out there.  We can't worry about it.  I mean, I...  You know, I occasionally use the word fag, you know, because I can't stand guys that  are like super fags, and I'll say it, you know?  And...  But that's me.  It's like if you're, you know, if you're black, you can use...  See, I...  If you're Jew, you can...  See, I don't agree with that theory either.  Yeah.  I think if a black guy is allowed to call another black guy a nigger, then I should  be able to do the same thing.  Well, what are you...  What group are you in?  I'm a...  I'm a Dago Wop bastard.  Yeah.  So...  So if somebody calls you a rock or whatever... 
[02:31:30]  I don't care.  Actually, I got a friend up in Boston, Jay, and he's Irish, and the most fun we have is  ragging each other's culture.  Like, I'll send him things about, like, drunks, and he sends me stuff like spaghetti sauce  and it's just constantly ragging each other's ethnic background.  And the worse it is, the funnier it gets.  Uh-huh.  Like, if he's even near my car, I check it for bombs, because he's Irish. 
[02:32:00]  Some of the funniest stuff, you've got to admit, is the stuff that really pisses people  off.  Uh-huh.  You know, I think as a society, we really got to start lightening up again.  Well, this is my bit for Gay Pride Weekend.  I'm not doing anything else, so I thought I'd try to get through here.  It's Gay Pride Weekend?  It certainly is.  I'll do my part.  And Sunday's Gay Pride Day.  Are you guys doing that wacky parade again?  Yeah, I'm not going to be in it.  I used to be in it, but I've done that.  Listen, you want to put in a plug for me? 
[02:32:30]  Get this.  No.  No, we don't want to.  We don't want to put it.  We don't want to wrap over there.  Wait, we don't want to.  Did you word that differently?  We're not plugging anything, man.  I'm a psychic counselor.  Yeah.  I'm a psychic.  You're a psychic.  And I'm pretty well known, too.  And you should have known what we were going to say.  No, no, I'm not working at the moment, but I will be working shortly at Cafe Cha Cha  in the West Village if you want to put in a plug for me.  Cafe Cha Cha.  Okay.  In the West Village, yeah.  It's mixed.  It's a mixed place.  All right, Kyler.  Yeah, the guys there like boys and men. 
[02:33:00]  I'm kidding.  Come on, smile.  See, that was funny.  You got my point, I think, maybe.  You can say whatever you want, and I'll be listening to see what you say.  Uh-oh.  All right.  We're being monitored.  Thank you, Kyler.  Have a good time, and keep in mind what I said, okay?  All right.  You've got a responsibility.  People are listening to you.  Okay.  Okay.  Have a fabulous weekend.  Oh, thank you.  That word I try to avoid.  Well, that's why I said it.  Fabulous.  Fabulous.  Yeah.  Okay.  See, now you can hear the fun in our voices. 
[02:33:30]  See?  Yeah.  I mean, I...  Stop cursing.  You've got to dump out.  I'm sure you've seen a lot of that, though.  I don't know what you mean.  All right.  I've got to go, Kyler.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Come on.  Line of the week right there?  That's pretty good.  Line of the week?  What?  I've got to give you...  Do it to me, man.  I've got to give you that.  But now you've got to explain it to the faithful listeners, because we've got to dump out of  the show, man.  He keeps saying the S-word.  He said the S-word.  Gary. 
[02:34:00]  Hey, what's going on?  What's up, Gary?  I just want to say that guy that was on before, you know, he was totally wrong in what he was  saying.  I'm totally with you guys.  You know, I think everything that you're doing and making fun of, it's totally funny, and  the gay community is behind you.  You're a gay?  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Could they get in front of me, maybe side by side?  I'm totally with you guys.  I love the gay humor, and it's no big deal.  Those guys are being anal, literally. 
[02:34:30]  All right.  You're behind us all the way.  Great.  All right.  We appreciate it, Gary.  Thanks.  All right.  That's no problem.  All right, man.  Have a great weekend.  Take care.  Love you guys.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Back at you.  I got to get out of here, man.  No matter what we say, it could be interpreted another way.  Great.  This is back in the closet.  Yeah.  This is wonderful.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, Opie.  How about the game tonight?  Yeah.  What about, whoa, go Knicks. 
[02:35:00]  Kick ass.  Gotta drink me some beer.  That's right.  Smoke the camels without the filters.  Bang some broads.  Yeah.  That's right, damn it.  Got hooters.  Hey, Ann, your mom did say I was hot.  Oh, come on, Mom.  Don't bang Opie.  You f*** my mom.  I'm f***ing yours.  Oh, this is disgusting.  I say lay back and enjoy it. 
[02:35:30]  It's a hell of a bargain ride.  Opie and density.  A couple of real mothers.  One, oh, seven.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talks at 1027.  You've got to get this point of view across, I guess.  Baseball diamonds are a gal's best friend.  Wow, the hunk-o-meter. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, they're pitting a cheater against Piazza.  Obviously, for a hunk.  Who's the biggest hunk?  Who's the biggest hunk?  Yeah, a cheater or Piazza?  He's got a bunch of stats and everything.  This is Cheryl Connelly from the Daily News.  You know, this lady smokes crack.  She has to.  She's writing a whole article on this, right, Ann?  Yeah.  And where he'd take you for a weekend getaway, Dirk Jeter.  This lady assumes that Dirk Jeter would take you to meet his mom.  Oh, sure.  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  I don't care that he plays for the Yankees.  Is that what he calls his penis, Mom?  Exactly.  I'll take you to meet my mom.  She's delusional.  He's a guy, for Christ's sake.  She lived the Comac Motorist.  Brother.  Odds on getting to third base with Dirk Jeter.  Only if you're a pop diva who can hit the high notes.  Oh.  I think she's trying to be wacky.  Wow, that was worth being on page nine of the Daily News today.  Is this sports? 
[02:37:00]  Odds on getting to third base with Piazza.  Only if you can dress flashier than he does.  Does any sports fan really care about this?  I guess she's catering to the ladies or something.  Hey, afternoon, everybody.  Mike and Amanda, I've got a fan.  Today we're taking phone calls.  Hey, you know, who's the biggest hunk?  Come on, look at him, Jeter with Piazza.  You've got to give Jeter a lot of credit.  I mean, he's got a nice ass.  Look at him.  Hey, Mad Dog, are you trying to tell me you're bored with taking phone calls about the Mets 
[02:37:30]  and the Yankees?  Well, this is in the paper today.  I think it's sports over the end of the day.  Over the end of the day.  Well, would you like to talk to some of your listeners today?  Yeah, why not?  I think we can take a few phone calls.  All right, why don't you throw the topic out there?  Well, who's the biggest hunk?  Jeter with Piazza.  Yeah, I've seen them both.  I've been looking at them.  Gee, I've got to give Jeter a lot of the ass.  But Piazza's got the arms, and I think Piazza's a little hairier.  I prefer my men with a hairy chest. 
[02:38:00]  And I don't know if I like Piazza.  He's squatting all the time, being a catcher.  You don't want the testicle dragging in the dirt like that.  It can make calluses, and I don't think I want to handle callus-y testicles.  Can I remember, Maggie?  That's right, the look.  And Jeter, you know, he's been with some housebags in his day, but I think I could turn him around.  I'd take him in the back seat of my toronto.  So who would you give the rusty trombone to?  Well, yeah, you've got to go with Piazza on the rusty trombone. 
[02:38:30]  Because I'm not reaching for the testicles.  I'm giving him a reach-around.  But you've got to figure out what a catcher is squatting and a lot of air blowing through back there.  It's not going to stink.  It's maybe a Jeter who's standing up a lot.  All right, let's go to the phones, all right?  It's a great topic for your show today on WFAG.  All right, Joe.  You're on the air.  Hi, I'd just like to say that Master Piazza has the best ass.  What are you talking about?  You've got to get Jeter the ass.  No, no.  I'm an ass man. 
[02:39:00]  I know.  Jeter's got the better ass.  Come on.  Come on, my friend.  Ain't that bunch of steel?  You don't see him there when he's behind the plate.  Craps down or bent over like that.  It gets me so excited.  Oh, oh.  Thank you, Joe.  We never set clothes like this on a van.  As far as hairdos go, I don't know.  I kind of like the co-op Piazza's button.  But I'm in that short thing, Jeter's button.  You don't like that wacky beard of Piazza's or the wacky sideburn?  No, I like a little bit of hair on my thighs. 
[02:39:30]  You know?  I don't like the short hair that Jeter's got.  No?  But I get my hair.  Okay.  And I'm in my hair.  That's right, Dork.  I've undressed both of these with my eyes.  And, you know, I've got to give my, like I said, yes to Jeter's chest and arms to Piazza.  Nice, strong, manly arms.  No surprise you like the Giants.  Oh, he could probably.  Yeah, he could be a Piazza. 
[02:40:00]  I know if I'm in a sack with him, he could throw me around like a little spinner.  You know, a strong upper body strength.  But I think Piazza would be a lot more sensitive to my new feminine needs.  Anybody?  That's right, Dork.  Joe, you're on the air with Mad Dog.  Is this Mad Dog?  Yeah, I'm not going to Mad Dog, Joe.  Out of bed.  How you doing?  What do you think, Joe?  I think that Jeter's better.  In what way?  And that Howard Stern's better than the Baltimore.  I think Bubba Bowie. 
[02:40:30]  Can't curse on him, Joe.  Oh, brother.  This is just getting bad.  That was pretty funny, too.  All right, let's take another break here, all right?  Are you done, Mad Dog?  No, no, no, no, no.  Why don't you bring Imus in with you today?  Oh, jeez.  You want to go there?  No.  I've got my big fag cowboy hat on my lap here as I'm looking at Piazza. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  And it's growing.  Yeah, that guy gets the wrinkle out of my neck.  Obi and Anthony.  Oh, those guys are fast!  1027.  All right, Bob, are you ready to play Hi, Mom, I'm Gay?  Absolutely.  Totally.  Now, I hear you're 35 years old.  Yeah.  Never been married.  Ever.  Are you gay? 
[02:41:30]  No rope swallowing.  All right, Bob, let's give it a shot.  All right.  You've got to try to convince her, man.  All right, I'll be right back.  Let's give your mom a call, man.  Hello?  Mom, can you hear me, Dad?  Yeah.  It's Bobby.  Bobby?  Yeah.  Where are you?  I'm at work.  Yeah, well, you sound awful funny.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Hey, Mom, you sitting down?  Why?  I've got to tell you something.  What?  Don't get nervous. 
[02:42:00]  I thought I'd be meaning to tell you.  I was going to tell you when you called earlier today.  Yeah?  I'm gay.  Oh, you're full of s***.  I'm a twinkie.  I swear it.  Bobby, will you stop it?  You know, I have enough aggravation.  What?  How come you never believe me?  Because I don't believe you.  Why?  Well, you just had a child, Bobby.  Yeah.  That was to throw you off.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know, I wanted to tell you that.  I was hoping you wouldn't take it lightly, but...  Bobby.  What?  Are you trying to be funny? 
[02:42:30]  I'm not.  I got to tell you, you know, I just don't feel right.  I've known it ever since I was a kid.  Bobby, are you with Donna?  Not at the moment.  Not at the moment.  All right.  With Lenny.  Bobby, you can tell your father that.  I'm not even going to bring it up.  All right.  You're the one that's always said some terrible things about those people.  So what's the, you know, what's all of a sudden?  Well, it's to throw everyone off, you know?  Bobby, I don't believe it.  However, you know...  You still love me?  I've had enough heartache.  I think, you know, good job.  You still love me? 
[02:43:00]  Of course I love you.  You just won't kiss me on the lips anymore, huh?  Bobby, what the hell are you doing?  Drinking?  No.  No.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  I'm working.  Your father's out to lunch.  Have you told Gene this?  No.  I was going to spring it on him tonight.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Yeah.  You do that.  Stand a long distance away, will you?  I will.  Out of arm's reach.  Bobby, don't give me that balloon, please.  You break my heart when you do things like this.  I'll talk to you later when I can sit down with you.  Yeah, that'd be nice.  All right.  All right. 
[02:43:30]  I love you.  See you later.  I love you, too.  Okay.  Holy Jesus.  Dude.  I got to get back to her quick, man.  She's got to put a knife in her wrist.  You better do that.  Hey, Bob.  Yeah.  Bob, I'm gay.  I'm gay.  This guy sounds like the manliest dude around.  I've been meaning to tell you for a long time, Bob.  I'm gay.  That'll explain the rough throat.  Yeah, I'm a Twinkie, Bob.  That's a Twinkie.  That's how I got the throat this bad, Bob. 
[02:44:00]  I've been swallowing too many ropes.  Hey, Bob.  Bob.  You're sitting down, Bob.  Oh, man.  Hold on.  You want to call your mom back and then call us?  Yeah, I got to get her head out of the oven.  All right.  We'll recognize your voice.  Call back, all right?  All right.  Thanks.  All right, man.  Bye.  Sometimes you feel like a man.  What do you do?  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  Opie and Anthony.  One, oh, two, seven. 
[02:44:30]  I must know evil before he can condemn it.  Opie.  One must see evil before he can banish it.  Anthony.  This is disgusting.  It's very, very cool.  Oh.  F-N.  It's beyond moronic.  What's up, moronic?  Opie and Anthony.  One, oh, two, seven.  Courtney Cox.  From Friends.  From Friends.  She's dropping Cox.  Excuse me?  She's dropping Cox. 
[02:45:00]  On what?  What do you mean?  Well, her name's Courtney Cox.  Right.  Oh, her name.  She's dropping her last name.  Oh.  She's getting rid of Cox?  She's getting rid of Cox, yes.  Huh.  She doesn't like Cox anymore.  Why?  Well, she wants to use her husband's name.  She's married to David Arquette.  Right.  Courtney Arquette.  So she wants to be called Courtney Arquette.  She wants to drop Cox.  But she likes Cox.  Well, I guess she's liked it for a while. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  It was very good for her and her career.  But, yeah, for her career, I would think she would, you know, hold on to Cox.  I wouldn't think she would just, I wouldn't think she would cast Cox to the wayside like that.  Well, she's moving on with her career without Cox.  Hmm.  So.  All right.  Sans Cox.  Mm-hmm.  Why?  Why?  I don't know why everyone's giggling.  I don't know either.  It's something, if a girl wants to change her name, it's fine. 
[02:46:00]  I just find it a little odd that she's been treated well by Cox for so many years that she would just dump it like that.  She's brave enough to live her life without Cox.  I guess so.  So.  Arquette.  Arquette.  Courtney Arquette.  Courtney Arquette from now on.  Not a hyphen?  Cox no more.  Right.  Huh.  That old gag.  You know, I actually felt a downward spiral in that bit. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, sure.  Of course.  Of course you did.  That's what you're supposed to feel.  There's no life bone.  Oh.  Oh, the other thing we have to mention is the book that's coming out on Reagan.  Really?  And it looks like President Reagan didn't like Bush.  Really?  Right.  Reagan didn't like Bush.  Really?  Did he like Cox?  Or did he drop Cox?  Courtney?  I mean, well, would he know about Cox back in 81? 
[02:47:00]  Sure.  I think at that point during his presidency, she was on that Bruce Springsteen video, right?  So he was dancing in the dark.  So he was well aware of Cox at that point.  Cox was on the stage just shaking and, you know, remember?  Gyrating Cox.  Sure.  We saw her.  She was dancing in the dark.  He forgot all about the Cox.  With Bruce.  All right.  So, yeah, this book is claiming that.  You know, you figure it doesn't work the first time.  It's like putting sour milk in the fridge. 
[02:47:30]  You go, nope, still bad.  I like that.  This is debauchery mania.  I like that.  I like that.  You deserve the best, but that'd be a lot of work.  Here's the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 102.7.  So how was your Thanksgiving, Anthony?  Ah, I spent a little time with the family. 
[02:48:00]  I'll make sure.  Well, for a grandma's.  It was a big, you know, Italian Thanksgiving.  Very nice.  All the food that you could feed an army with.  And I was right up there.  Right at the next to the head of the table.  Uh-huh.  I made it all the way up.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Felt pretty good.  Yeah, because my brother wasn't there this year.  He was over at his in-laws.  Ah, so I got to move up into the Joe seat.  So there I was, like right before the head of the table.  I looked down at the little card table at the end, remembering years and years ago when I was there. 
[02:48:30]  And I had to worry.  I remember the middle of the table.  Sure.  I remember when I became a teenager and worked my way up from the card table to the real table,  but way at the card table end.  Well, how many people had to die in your family to get that space?  Oh, quite a few.  Okay.  Quite a few.  And then, you know, I worked my way up.  And as I was sitting there next to the head of the table, thinking there's only one more place to go, 
[02:49:00]  you start feeling old.  Old, old is what you start feeling.  Do you have any teenagers in your family?  Yeah.  So are you like the cool uncle where you, you know, go get them high and stuff in the coat room?  Oh, no, no.  Give them a little sip or two here or there?  They're like early teens, RJ and Chris.  Oh, all right.  They're piss, they're cool kids.  Yeah.  Oh, they idolize me.  It's great.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm cursing like a banshee at the table and stuff.  And they're just like, you are so cool.  You were drunk again. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  You were drunk again, obviously.  Well, a couple of beers, though.  Not as drunk as my mom.  So you're cool?  My mom was at the point.  She was at the I love you, F you stage.  Really?  Yeah, she gets like that every so often on holidays.  Was she snotted?  She was, ooh, drinking her wine.  Oh, yeah.  Boy, sitting there at the table all of a sudden.  And then you bring up the last time we were all hanging out as a family and she was hitting  the wine.  And she's like, oh, scratch your ass.  I wasn't saying that.  I don't do that.  Because we tell her when she really gets schnockered, she'll say, she'll talk to you and it's like, 
[02:50:00]  oh, baby, my son, it's so good to see you again.  And you're like, Ma, calm down.  Oh, F you.  F you.  F you.  No, but I love you.  I love you.  It's so good to see you again.  All right, Ma.  Look, I'm going to go into the kitchen.  I'm going to go.  Oh, yeah.  Don't leave.  F you.  F you.  And it's not F you.  It's the F word.  Well, Coke will do that to you.  Oh, Jesus.  Is that my mom doing Coke?  Well, I'm just assuming at this point. 
[02:50:30]  She's drinking some wine, having a good time with the family.  Could be acid.  And then we tell her that, you know, last time we were all together as a family, you got  that I love you, F you face.  And she's like, oh, no, I wasn't.  No.  An hour later, I love you, F you face.  And then she's bringing up, you know, school, when I was in school.  She goes, remember the time I got you that lovely fur coat?  Fur coat?  Fur coat.  She brought this up. 
[02:51:00]  I forgot about it.  Elementary school.  Did it go with your velour shirt that's on the FM Talk website?  Dude, I don't know what kind of.  You were like a pimp when you were eight years old.  I wish I was as cool as a pimp when I was in that grade.  But it turned out all I was was an elementary school kid going to elementary school in a  fur coat.  My mother's like, oh, it kept you warm.  I go, no, the coat didn't.  And the blood running from my nose over my body kept me warm because I'd be beat up.  Because faggot. 
[02:51:30]  Hey, Anthony, you're a faggot.  Only faggots and women wear fur coats.  I don't know what kind of dope she was doing.  She comes home one day from the store.  I'm just thinking, I want a snorkel jacket like all the other kids had in school.  But, no, my mother said, you know, you ever see on the sidelines of the football games,  Joe Namath wears a fur coat.  Oh, yeah.  Joe Namath wears a fur coat.  Joe Namath was also a quarterback for the Jets at the time.  You know, pretty cool job. 
[02:52:00]  So he could pretty much wear whatever the hell he wanted.  Right.  He's not even going to still hang out with them.  Right.  Exactly.  You know.  Who's that other big black guy that has the daughter in the films, the football player?  He used to crochet on the sidelines.  Greer.  Rosie Greer.  Rosie Greer.  Sure.  He would crochet on the sidelines.  Right?  Right.  Anybody going to crack him in the head?  Hey, Rosie, you faggot.  Of course not.  If I was to crochet in fifth grade, what would happen to me?  You'd be dead.  The crochet hook would be in my rectum.  Everyone knows that.  You wear a fur coat. 
[02:52:30]  It doesn't matter.  Joe Namath wears one on the sidelines.  Yeah.  I was being beat up because Mom got me a fur coat.  She was always, she always thought she was like ahead of the trend and like she was going  to make us, we were models, fashion models.  A fur coat.  Give me my snorkel jacket.  By the time you were in ninth grade, were you dressing like Clyde Frazier?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I wanted jeans.  I wanted a t-shirt.  I wanted sneakers.  Like I dress now.  So she brought up the fur coat at the Thanksgiving Day table. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Right.  And I totally forgot about it.  But yeah, she had gotten me a fur coat.  All the little family memories come up in Thanksgiving, things you wish you'd never remember again.  But another thing, like sneakers, I always wanted the, what were they, the PF Flyer high  top black sneakers.  Those are the ones I want.  They look like a hoodlum.  If you wear those, you look like a hoodlum.  They want to look like one of the, and then she'd use the N word and stuff.  Oh, she would? 
[02:53:30]  You know, Italian.  So, you know.  Hey, come on.  She's older now.  She goes to church.  She goes to church now.  Come on.  That was a long time ago.  But I wanted to wear the high top black PF Flyer sneakers.  And my mother would always come back with those stupid white skippies, you know.  The stupid sneakers with the rubber front and everything.  Your typical Wonder Years sneakers.  Sure.  You know.  And I was pissed.  And pants.  I wanted jeans. 
[02:54:00]  I wanted to go to school in jeans.  She'd get me like dress slacks.  Here's your slacks.  And a dress shirt and a tie for the first day of school.  I'm there with a briefcase.  I swear to God.  You would think I was closing deals for IBM the way she dressed me to go off to the fifth grade.  I had a briefcase and a shirt, matching shirt and tie, which my brother had to wear the exact same thing.  Are we twins?  No.  No.  She dressed us like we were.  Now everyone thought you were twins.  Right.  And we had to have the same little ties and pants and shoes. 
[02:54:30]  One time, in her disco diva phase, she bought me platform shoes.  Dude, platform shoes.  Disco shoes.  I had the big platform shoes.  I swear, I had eight-inch platform.  I looked like that jerk-off in Saturday Night Fever.  Tony, are you going to call me, Tony? 
[02:55:00]  Tony, give me a call.  She's pregnant, Father.  You think the Pope could get her an abortion, Father?  Tony, you didn't even call me.  Look, Tony, I'm dancing, Tony.  I'm dancing on the bridge, Tony.  I had those big, dopey shoes.  That's classic.  And then one time, my sister's dogs, she had two little dogs, eight shoes.  Yeah, baby, that was me.  And she, my sister's dog ate the heels of the shoes, the big platform shoes. 
[02:55:30]  I was like, thank you.  Extra can of kennel ration for you.  Back to my skippies.  That's why I dressed like this.  Because for years, I couldn't.  I wanted jeans, sneakers, and a T-shirt my whole frigging life.  So now, I wear what I want.  And then I go to Thanksgiving dressed the same way.  And I was like, you look like a slob.  I was like, oh, sorry, I don't have my platform disco shoes and fur coat, Mom.  So you could have got the fur coat out of the closet for you.  Yeah, I'm sure. 
[02:56:00]  Look like I'm coming out of the closet with that frigging thing on.  But her big excuse was, Joe Namath wore a fur coat on the sidelines, walking back and forth.  Remember when he was injured a lot of times?  And he had that wacky coat.  Yeah, he was still like on the field and stuff.  He walked back and forth the sidelines.  He had this big fur coat.  But he could pull off that look, man.  He had the blondes by his side.  Yeah, two people pulled off that look.  And there were stories in the paper how he's banging broads in between quarters and stuff.  Joe Namath and Fred Mertz. 
[02:56:30]  Remember that when he put the big coat on?  There you go, 23's gonna do.  Hey, Apple, let's jitterbug.  I'm gonna get some broads with this coat.  Come on, Rick.  He had a big furry bear coat.  That's what I looked like.  So was your childhood idol Joe Namath, Ed?  Yeah, you know.  Were you wearing pantyhose like him, too?  Yeah, he did do the commercial for the pantyhose.  No, thank God my mother didn't feel I should be wearing pantyhose. 
[02:57:00]  All right.  Let's go to Cesar.  Cesar, what's going on today?  Anthony, you are a homo, man.  Oh, come on.  Listen, did Mama also buy the little fox skin scarf to match the coat?  No, there was no fox skin scarf.  Yes, there's a little mink scarf.  I bet you.  I'm admitting it was a gay coat.  She put me on a fag gay coat in elementary school where, gee, people aren't judging you too much by what you look like.  Hey, buddy, I bet you tied the mittens to the sleeve of the coats, too?  Nah, it wasn't that drastic.  You're a faggot, man. 
[02:57:30]  I had the big dopey, like, galoshes and stuff.  I wanted, like, fireman boots, you know?  Things with the big metal clips.  Sure.  Yeah.  I get the totes, totes galoshes.  Put on your robbers.  You were obviously poor like myself growing up.  No, she did pretty good, you know?  I mean, it was all...  No, she was more, like, she would spend more to make me look like an asshole.  Now we know why Boomer beat you up in elementary school.  Yeah, exactly.  You had your cute little fur coat on.  My fur coat. 
[02:58:00]  I wanted a bomber jacket, you know?  I wanted regular high-top Pia Flyer sneakers, jeans, just looking like a kid.  But no, my mother figures, she's dressing me up like I'm in GQ or something.  GQ?  Well, that's what they would.  They would put stupid things like fur coats on, the models and stuff.  And she would see it and go, oh, that's a great look.  She used to dress me up like that.  She was goofing on me because she said over Thanksgiving, she said, well, when you dress  yourself, you look ridiculous.  What do you mean? 
[02:58:30]  And she pulled out pictures of me with striped pants and a plaid shirt.  I'm walking around like that.  I'm like, so?  Because that doesn't go.  I'm like, I don't care if it went or not.  That's the 70s look, though.  That's groovy.  That stuff went in the 70s.  That's like Greg Brady.  Haven't you seen the Brady Bunch?  They say it's in.  I remember going for back to school shopping and stuff.  You know, you go to the department store and walk around and you'd see stuff you want.  You're like, oh, that's good.  That's good.  Oh, no, that's crap.  That's what the lowlifes are wearing.  You know, Charles Nelson Reilly is wearing a scarf off to the right. 
[02:59:00]  You should wear that.  Yeah.  I can't see that.  If there's a picture with you with a Charles Nelson Reilly scarf, I need to see that.  Where's my scarf?  Oh, the ghost of Mrs. Yard.  Charles Nelson Reilly.  Oh, I'll tell you one thing.  If she would have bought me that coat when I was like 13, 14, I'd have banged it. 
[02:59:30]  What's with the fur on this coat, Anthony?  Why?  It was like Liberty Spikes that the punk rock is wearing.  Oh, my God.  O.P.N.F. Anthony.  We punish ignorance.  Hey, ass, turn down your radio.  1027.  Yeah, if you're in the paper today, Popeye's getting married.  I got married to Olive's Girl.  Yeah, she's a looker, huh? 
[03:00:00]  She's quite the lookser.  What are you...  Now, Popeye, what do you see in Olive Oil?  I mean, she really doesn't have a body.  Well, she's one girl.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Some pusky.  What?  Pusky.  What is pusky?  Bigs get rid out yourself.  Olive Oil has a lovely pusky. 
[03:00:30]  Popeye, I don't think you can say pusky on the radio.  Put my mighty hands around her skinny little butts.  Her skinny buts.  And then I gaze into her pusky.  You can't say pusky on the radio.  I can say whatever I want.  I'm Popeye.  Pusky, pusky, pusky.  Well, blow me down. 
[03:01:00]  She spent all that time with Brutusk.  Yeah.  I thought she was going to stretch out her pusky.  Popeye, you're going to get us fired.  Peck skin, quite the punch guy in.  You can't get fired for the word pusky.  It ain't even a word.  I've never heard the word pusky before. 
[03:01:30]  It's a fun word to say.  Pusky.  It looks like you're excited because you're going to finally be able to bed down Olive Oil.  Oh, yeah.  They're going to go on a Hunsie moon.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm going to tixke around my, oh, my boatsk.  I'm Popeye the Sailor.  Oh, she's a little flat chest kid.  Yeah, just a little.  A little, oh, let's go shy in the titsky section.  Oh, not too big on the titsky. 
[03:02:00]  You can't say.  But she makes up for it with the pusky.  Oh, and that narrow little ask.  Yeah.  Oh, she's got quite the lips go ask on it.  But I'm dreaming of the pusky.  Oh, well, blow me.  Down.  Oh, if I get a whole skedad in the hotel room. 
[03:02:30]  Hey, Popeye, I was always wondering this question.  Yes.  Does your unit get really big when you eat the spinach like your biceps?  Of course.  And I got a big tattoo of an anchor on it.  Oh.  Oh.  And it just appears sometimes.  Whenever a finch gets towards the pusky.  Hey, all right.  Come on.  You just can't say that word on the radio.  Why not?  I don't know.  Look up pusky in the dictionary.  Is he allowed to say pusky?  I can say whatever I want. 
[03:03:00]  I ain't no big wusky.  And I'll say pusky.  I'm Popeye the sailor man.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  It's never seemed good pusky.  All right.  Well, congratulate me.  Are you going to invite Brutus?  No.  I'm not inviting Brutus.  To the wedding, no?  He might try to steal me girl. 
[03:03:30]  I see.  He's always doing that in the past.  What about...  And Alavsk would always go with her.  What about Wimps, Lutzk?  What about Wimpy?  Oh, Wimps, Wimpski?  Yeah.  He's a homosexual.  Always in a search for meat.  Oh, good, good.  I'll gladly pay you today for a hamburger tomorrow.  Or whatever the hell you used to say.  Wow, Wimpy's a homosexual, huh?  Wimpy's a homosexual. 
[03:04:00]  And Olive Oil has a nice...  Olive's girl was a whore until she married me.  I see.  And now it's just me and Olive's pusky.  Oh, got to give her some implants.  Because she's a little shy in the titskies.  You said that already.  All right.  Well, do you want to hang out with us for the rest of the show, Popeye?  I'll stay, but I gots to go to my Hunsky moon.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  Okay.  I'm rip-roaring, look-skin-forward to some pusky. 
[03:04:30]  Wow, all right.  Where did Anthony go?  He doesn't like Popeye or something?  Yeah.  The Obi and Anthony Show.  I have no clue what anybody's saying, but it's the funniest damn show.  More stupidity on the way.  One, oh, two, seven.  It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway.  You're going to have to, you know, turn a cent to see what the hell these idiots are doing next. 
[03:05:00]  Obi and Anthony.  We refuse to be responsible.  So go screw yourself.  We refuse to be responsible.  One, oh, two, seven.  Obi and Anthony.  You can like some conflict.  Piss me off, okay?  Oodley, oodley, oodley, oodley, oodley, oodley.  One, oh, seven.  Isn't today the day we could hear some sound from Mars?  Well, Opie, I think the Mars lander has touched down on Mars,  but they have to wait a while before they get any response from it. 
[03:05:30]  But they do have a microphone on there, so you'll be able to go to the website  and listen to the sounds of Mars.  The sounds of Mars.  Martian winds.  Sweeping the landscape.  We leave you with the sounds of the Martian winds.  We don't normally leave you with the sounds of Mars,  but since the lander's there, we have the microphones and the equipment. 
[03:06:00]  The sounds of the Martian winds.  Technology is a frightening, often fascinating thing,  when from millions of miles away, you can actually hear the sounds of Mars.  So, we leave you with the sounds of Mars.  Well, that confirms it. 
[03:06:30]  I never want to grow up.  It's beyond moronic.  It's sub-moronic.  Opie and Opie.  1027.  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027.  The talk you can't ignore. 
[03:07:00]  Dave writes, for your information, about two hours ago, Tom Brokaw was seen scuba diving in the ocean,  doing a live broadcast to see if JFK Jr. was faking his death.  He is hoping he will reappear from the water and catch him in the act.  Come on.  Well, you know, I don't think Tom Brokaw's in the water.  I believe, finally, the story's dead, and they've run out of angles,  so I wouldn't be surprised if, you know, some of the networks did get some scuba divers down there 
[03:07:30]  to see if something's going on.  But actually, scuba diving?  Hmm?  Actually on the beach?  With scuba gear.  With scuba gear.  Ladies and gentlemen, Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  You know, it's strange.  I sound better with a regulator in my mouth than I do just trying to speak normally.  Normally.  Normally.  Hey, Tom?  Yes, Tom Brokaw. 
[03:08:00]  You sound a little out of it today.  Well, I...  You sound a little lightheaded or something.  I was deep diving looking for JFK Jr.  I don't believe he's dead.  I think it's a big conspiracy.  And I ran out of oxygen 200 feet below the surface and had to ascend so rapidly that  Tom Brokaw, me, Tom Brokaw, got into the bends.  Nitrogen bubbles in my bloodstream, so I'm a bit woozy.  But I do believe I did see JFK Jr. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  When I was...  Just before I passed out, I also saw a ricochet rabbit and the Care Bears.  They were all doing a dance.  And then someone pulled me out of the drink.  Yeah.  Tom?  I believe it was the Navy vessel of the grass.  Still on sight, picking up any lost screw that came from JFK's plane at the cost of millions  and millions of dollars. 
[03:09:00]  I was...  I was wowed by Arielle, the little mermaid.  It was nice.  You know, she's got nice cans for a cartoon mermaid, the little redhead chick.  You know, those mermaids, very deceiving.  Yep.  Great cans you could, you know, feel.  But if you try to go south, it gets a little fishy.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Night Lanier. 
[03:09:30]  I couldn't tell where the skin ended and the scales started as I tried making a love to  a mermaid.  On my next report, Tom Brokaw makes love to a mermaid, flipping up scales to find the  elusive mermaid gash.  You know what the odd thing is?  It smells like human. 
[03:10:00]  I'm Tom, while we have you in the studio.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What was the toughest thing you've ever had to say on the news?  I believe it was back in the 80s.  It had to be the day that...  Oh, my...  The day Leon Klinghoffer was thrown off of the cruise ship Akili-Golaro. 
[03:10:30]  The Akili-Golaro, where a wheelchair-bound Leon Klinghoffer was thrown overboard by terrorists  who took over the cruise ship Akili-Golaro.  The A-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H-H.  Why do you always make Tom Brokaw say that?  Say what?  Oh, look at the time they've refilled my oxygen tanks. 
[03:11:00]  I am still searching for evidence of the death of JFK.  Well, good luck in the search, Mr. Brokaw.  Thank you, Opie and Anthony, as I now descend back into the depths.  There you go, Tom Brokaw.  Swimming away.  Tom Brokaw.  Hey, he's having sex with a mermaid. 
[03:11:30]  I can't even believe these morons.  Opie, he's a disgusting little man identity.  What a douchebag.  Stand over.  This is sicker than Faces of Death.  This one's not on the CD because it's kind of a special song.  It's not on the CD because it sucks?  Eat one.  That would seem to follow, wouldn't it?  No, it's actually not a very funny song.  If you don't mind, my wife and I were recently divorced. 
[03:12:00]  You're 12.  I know.  You're 12.  Short marriage.  Okay.  Okay.  How old are you?  I'm 27.  27?  Yeah.  And my wife of 16 years, Erin, and I divorced recently, and we have a little six-year-old girl.  And she doesn't really understand why Mommy isn't living with us anymore.  Yeah.  I did my best to write this little lullaby and perhaps explain it to her.  I like the setup. 
[03:12:30]  That's great.  Thanks.  Okay.  You can bring it down a little bit here.  Hush, little girl, sweet, sweet baby, don't cry tonight.  Daddy's here and he'll sing you a soft lullaby tonight.  Why can't it all be like it was before? 
[03:13:00]  How can I explain why Mommy's not here anymore?  Cause Daddy likes porno and ten-dollar whores.  Daddy gets wasted and robs liquor stores. 
[03:13:30]  Daddy likes robbing against little boys on the bus.  I think that's why your mommy left us.  Pretty.  Hush, little girl.  There is no reason to fret tonight.  Don't mind the smoke. 
[03:14:00]  Daddy just wants to forget.  Like, soon it will all be like it was before.  Any minute she will walk through that front door.  But Daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer. 
[03:14:30]  Then he wants sex that involves Mommy's rear.  Daddy has sores on his genitals, oozing with pus.  I think that's why your mommy left us.  Please don't cry.  I swear I'll try to be here by your side. 
[03:15:00]  Right after Daddy gets home from the barn, visits his bookie and steals a new car.  He'll drive to the strip club, and if Daddy plays his cards right, he'll bring home your new mommy tonight.  La-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di. 
[03:15:30]  La-di-di-di-di-di.  Look at me.  I'm making.  Look at me.  I'm all teered up now.  I'm welling up with tears.  Even Dice is tearing up over there.  Yeah, you got me, huh?  You got my sensitive side.  Game.  Jackcase. 
[03:16:00]  Who cares?  We can't play chocolate salty balls anymore.  We got some new songs.  That's Stephen Lynch.  His CD's called Half a Man.  You can order it by emailing him at pushead at AOL.com.  That marketing's really taking off, isn't it?  That's not my forte.  And it's pushead, P-U-S, not pushead, which is P-U-S-S, obviously.  What did everybody do before the Internet?  Like, you know, send me a postcard or something, P-O-B, you know?  Is that what you did? 
[03:16:30]  I don't know.  All right.  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027.  I must admit, I ate monkey meat.  It was me.  Damn me the hell.  Mr. Hassan, it was you?  I went into the zoo and had sex with Yoshi the Chimpanzee.  Damn me the hell. 
[03:17:00]  I couldn't help it.  After spending time on the Platter of the Apes,  I grew accustomed to that red chimpanzee ass.  Ah!  Have you ever made love to a chimpanzee?  Ah, no.  I can't say I have.  Nothing like it.  Once you go chimp, you never go back.  That supple red ass.  Yearning.  I went to the zoo.  Yoshi spun around and faced that red ass at me. 
[03:17:30]  It was yearning, calling me, as was the burning bush when I played Moses.  Saying, take this, thine red ass upon thee.  Make love to my red chimpanzee ass.  I must admit, I ate monkey meat.  Damn me the hell. 
[03:18:00]  I ate monkey meat at the zoo.  Now, Mr. Heston.  Yes?  Why would you be attracted to a chimpanzee when you had Nova?  Nova.  Yes, she was quite a babe in that loincloth.  But she just didn't have enough bodily hair.  When Zira seduced me in that little cave thing they lived in,  and I did have a threesome with Zira and Cornelius,  I admit it.  I ate monkey meat. 
[03:18:30]  I tasted the forbidden fruit of the monkey's red ass.  I couldn't resist.  I visited the zoo and saw Yoshi.  Little Yoshi.  And that red ass.  My God, forgive me.  Lord God, please forgive me for partaking of the forbidden meat of monkey.  Damn me the hell. 
[03:19:00]  Now, Mr. Heston, there's a lovely picture of your girlfriend on Newsday.  Look at the cans on Yoshi.  My God.  That's the luckiest baby chimp I've ever seen.  Getting just snuggled against the bosom of that hairy ape.  Damn.  I love that monkey.  I love that monkey.  Yeah?  All right.  I'll be making more visits to more zoos.  There might be a population explosion of chalent and chimps. 
[03:19:30]  New breed.  The chalent and chimp.  That's right.  It wears the toupee and has a red ass.  Is it true also that you were Caesar's father?  Damn.  Damn, you found me out.  All right.  My six points with zero.  Yeah.  Okay.  It was me.  Well, we got the explanation to the chimp getting pregnant at the L.A. zoo.  Well, thank you, Mr. Heston.  That's great.  I'm so embarrassed.  Can you take your little cherry and get out of the studio? 
[03:20:00]  We've got to show it in two minutes.  Where's my music?  Oh, you want to show it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Off horse.  Yeah.  Play my music, damn you.  All right.  I'll play your music.  Damn you.  Damn you.  Now get the hell out of here.  When are you putting those pictures up on the website?  Damn you.  Damn you all to hell.  And there he goes, everyone.  Charlton Heston.  Wow.  Opie and Anthony. 
[03:20:30]  Cunnilingus and psychiatry brought us to this.  On FM Talk at 1027.  The talk you can't ignore.  Oh. </pre>
