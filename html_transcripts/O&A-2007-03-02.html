<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the usual vulgar banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  They immediately launched into a discussion of several news stories: a middle school principal caught dealing meth and watching gay porn; a U.S. Weekly reporter's reaction to Glenn Beck suggesting nude photos; and a New York City police officer reporting his former teacher for years of sexual abuse starting when he was 12, sparking a debate about teacher-student relationships and the impact of the teacher's attractiveness.  The hosts then devoted considerable time to Anna Nicole Smith's death, expressing disgust at the media spectacle surrounding her funeral and the ongoing legal battles.  Caller segments featured a listener's experience losing his virginity to a married, older woman and another's encounter with a Wendy's manager.  A conflict with Red Wolf Broadcasting, who accused them of being "smut peddlers," was addressed, with Opie and Anthony countering by highlighting pornographic links on a Red Wolf hip-hop station's website.  They also mocked Rebecca from the "Wake Up Club" morning show, playing clips to highlight its perceived low quality, referencing her hit-and-run incident and criminal record, and mentioning a legal dispute with the station.  The show ended with amusement at American Idol contestant Elena's emotional breakdown after elimination.

The show continued with a discussion of American Idol contestant Antonella Barba's popularity despite her poor singing, contrasting it with her online photos and playing a clip of Glenn Beck awkwardly flirting while discussing them.  A bizarre news story about the drug-dealing, naked, gay porn-watching middle school principal followed, leading to a "story of the month" contest.  A significant segment focused on Andrew Dice Clay and his upcoming VH1 reality show, with clips and discussion of his numerous self-made videotapes (e.g., "Dice with Mice," "Dice with Rice").  Dice Clay himself called in, engaging in a back-and-forth with the hosts about his career and projects.  More mocking of "The Wake Up Club" followed, with the hosts highlighting its dullness, before the expected Tracy Morgan guest appearance was delayed due to him being at a different station. A caller, Joe, inadvertently revealed Morgan's location, prompting an apology and a tangent about one of the hosts’ inability to smell and mocking another radio station's name ("Soft F***").

Andrew Dice Clay’s interview continued, covering his career, hiatus, a planned Giant Stadium performance, past successes, and strained relationships with colleagues, including crediting himself with introducing Jimmy Norton to Opie and Anthony.  Tracy Morgan finally joined, and the conversation shifted to his sex life, his role on 30 Rock, and his recent DUI arrest, detailing the interaction with the arresting officer.  The show then descended into raunchy humor and sexually explicit jokes and commentary, interspersed with celebrity gossip and opinions on other comedians.  This culminated in the arrival of women from the Bunny Ranch, leading to further explicit discussions and interactions, with the hosts commenting on their bodies and actions while they performed sexual acts on camera.

The arrival of Brooke and Bunny from the Bunny Ranch continued the sexually explicit content.  Bill and several other unidentified individuals were also present. The main focus was a graphic depiction of a sexual encounter between "Big A," the two Bunny Ranch women, and others present, with the hosts providing commentary and encouragement.  Explicit descriptions of sexual acts, graphic language, and discussion of genitalia were prominent, noting the use of a modified toothbrush as a sex toy.  Big A's nervousness and failure to reach orgasm, as well as the women's disgust at bodily fluids, were all highlighted.  Post-encounter discussion included sexual innuendo and crude humor.

The show concluded with a segment focused on the sweating, embarrassed "Big A" after his sexual encounter.  Opie, Anthony, and Jimmy discussed his discomfort, joking about his body odor and speculating about its source, escalating into vulgar descriptions of body odor, sexual acts, and bodily functions.  Tracy Morgan joined, sharing his own embarrassing sexual experiences.  They offered Big A money and meals to compensate for his humiliation. The Bunny Ranch women further detailed their experiences and unusual client requests, including a stepdaughter role-play scenario. The broadcast ended with more sexually explicit jokes and banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM 202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Opie, Opie, do you want to play?  Anthony, I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton, I'm dancing, I'm dancing, I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable, I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him, but with Jimmy you never know, it could be AIDS. 
[00:00:30]  No.  Yes, yes.  It's the Opie and Anthony show, the virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today.  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Stop whining.  Ah.  Nah.  Stop it.  Stop it. 
[00:01:00]  Quiet.  I'm Detective John Kimball.  Who?  John Kimball.  John Kimball.  The furthest thing from John Kimball.  Oh, I'm laughing because the boys are bringing in some of the material for today that we could go to.  Yes.  Uh, and I just read this one.  Middle school principal caught dealing meth, found naked in office watching gay porn. 
[00:01:30]  And?  Where's the story?  And then you got Dinah, or Dina Sansink from U.S. Weekly, was stunned into silence when Glenn Beck hinted that he'd like to take some nude photos of her during the discussion about tawdry pictures of American Idol's Antonella Barber.  Nude.  It's going to be a good day with the Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning.  Antonella.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:02:00]  Friday edition.  Uh, Jimmy's reading an article, and I just read it as well, and you're annoyed, right?  Oh, this, uh, yeah, this lady that's, uh, there's a cop now.  He's, he's, he's now a cop, tells the court he was seduced for years at an Eastside school, so basically he's ratting on the teacher that he used to have sex with when he was 12.  How old is he now?  24.  Oh, come on.  This guy started having sex.  Actually, I think he started having sex with her at, uh, 13.  The 12-year-old might be so indifferent.  Like, it makes that much of a difference. 
[00:02:30]  Or you might be right, whatever.  Why am I even trying to correct you?  Like, it matters.  Uh, but, yeah, he started having sex with his teacher around 12, 13 years old.  Yeah.  Uh, the sex continued through high school, through college, when he entered the police academy.  That's called a relationship.  Um, but the problem is, I guess she was having sex with other students.  She finally got caught, and now this guy, who's a police officer here in New York City, decided to rat her out.  Then he, now that, now I'm reading the article, and it's saying something like she was, uh, making 911 calls and, like, had rape allegations. 
[00:03:00]  She was acting out because now he's with somebody else or something, so she might have kind of looked on herself.  So she's a little kooky?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's an interesting story in the New York paper today.  Oh, you don't know what side to take, sometimes.  Right, Jimmy?  You read one, and then you go, oh, he's an ass.  But then you read the other part, and you go, it could be hurry.  All right.  Who knows?  You don't know who's...  Let's just agree to disagree.  When it comes to a female teacher and a male student, it's tough to pick sides. 
[00:03:30]  Exactly.  It depends on, we've got to see a picture of the teacher.  Right.  And then we can make a sound decision based on the facts.  Most of us, when we were growing up, that was one of our fantasies, having sex with a teacher or an older woman.  And, you know, but then you see some of these kids, and you're like, oh, he wasn't ready for that.  So I think it's like a case-by-case basis.  I think there's a lot of guys out there listening right now that had sex with their teacher growing up, or an older babysitter, or just an older woman in the neighborhood, and they're completely fine today. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Completely fine.  I think older is fine if it's a few years, and, you know, you're the right age and maturity.  But if you're talking like, you know, a 40-year-old woman with a 13-year-old, that's a little weird.  You need that, like, blonde hottie.  Like someone in their mid-20s. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah, something like that.  Push at 30, maybe.  A vivid memory of being that old, you know, being in her teens, because it was just a few years ago.  That kind of thing.  No, that's fine.  But I guess this lady might be a kook then, huh, Jimmy?  Yeah, she seems like one, but, I mean, this is the first day I've heard of it.  So hopefully a lot of this good dirt will come out.  Yeah, there's a lot more to that story.  Well, the other, the headline of the day in the Post, of course, the New York Post talking about Anna Nicole Smith. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, turn the page, Jimmy.  Look at what the dress she's going to be wearing.  Yeah.  And the tiara.  And look at that headline.  Anna?  Okay.  Yeah, it says, Anna will be drop-dead gorgeous.  What scumbags.  I mean, yeah.  How can you read the New York Post and take them seriously if they got a headline like that?  It's the same paper that Linda Stacey writes for who got mad because we made fun of breast cancer at one point. 
[00:05:30]  Remember that woman?  Yeah, yeah.  It's the same column.  There's two who said how wrong it was that we made fun of breast cancer.  Yeah.  We should be fired.  What's the difference?  Yeah, that headline is just a little tasteless.  Well, they call her the Ice Queen on the front page.  Because she has a diamond tiara that she'll be wearing.  The Ice Queen tiara for thawing Anna Nicole.  They have to thaw her out.  And already the news has shown a shot of the funeral home or the examiner's office there in Florida. 
[00:06:00]  They're getting ready to move the body.  Wow, the news is covering it.  There's her beautiful dress.  Her rotting carcass will be wearing.  How horrible is that?  She had a dress designed.  Yeah.  She used a designer that she liked when she was living.  And now they made the dress for the death dress for the rotting corpse.  That's just wonderful for everybody.  Gosh, she's got to look really bad by now.  Yeah, absolutely.  She's been out of the ground for how long? 
[00:06:30]  Like I think you said yesterday, like a rotting apple.  Yeah.  Just if you're in Florida because that's the only the, maybe Vegas, whatever.  Put an apple outside for a few days.  That's Anna Nicole's head at this point.  You cut out a little mouth and then some eyes and a nose.  And you put it out and let it dry and it looks like a shrunken head.  That's what she looks like.  The little tiara was probably a bracelet.  And they just put it on her head because her head shrunk.  A mess.  Well, I guess it's going to finally be over. 
[00:07:00]  Well, there's part of it.  Then they got to figure out who the baby's father is.  Oh, it'll be in the news forever.  Because we're fascinated as Americans.  Oh, and the rest of the world looks and goes, see, this is why.  This is why we hate them.  No one even cared about her until she did that reality show, which was just amazing.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Way before Breaking Bonaduce, there was the Anna Nicole Smith reality show.  Which she was just snotted the whole time, walking around drunk on drugs. 
[00:07:30]  And that brought her back on everyone's radar.  Yeah.  And then they kind of started following around a little bit after that.  And then, you know, out of nowhere, her son dies.  A tragedy.  And now we're at where we are today.  The Ice Queen.  Drop dead gorgeous.  You know, I challenge America.  We like to do this from time to time.  Is there a better headline about Anna Nicole Smith than the one we got in New York?  The New York Post.  Godspeed.  The New York Post is the king of the headline.  Is there a paper out there that has a better headline than Anna will be drop dead gorgeous? 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  I challenge America.  What does your local paper say?  What's the headline?  Let's say hi to Danny in Queens.  What's up, Danny?  Hey, what's going on, O.N.?  Hey.  Yeah, I seen, uh, she was on, uh, AOL yesterday, that teacher.  They had the article about her.  She wasn't even that good looking.  You could tell just by looking at her she was a freak.  She wasn't even that good looking.  You could tell just by looking at her.  So it would have been all right if she was hot?  Absolutely. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, yeah, sure.  If she was good looking, why not?  You know, like the other one who went to prison that time.  She wasn't too bad looking, you know?  Who, Debbie, uh, Lefebvre?  Yeah, yeah, the one who came out.  She wasn't too bad looking?  She was, uh, Lefebvre's the hottest, uh, one of these.  Hottest teacher ever.  Hottest teacher ever to be busted for having sex with a student award.  This one definitely wasn't hot.  No way at all.  It's a trophy, a big gold thumb up.  All right, so, Elwood, you're saying it would have been okay if she was hotter?  Oh, sure, why not? 
[00:09:00]  But maybe these, maybe these.  That's a young boy's dream.  Yeah, but maybe these young boys, they still were into it just because it was an older woman  with experience.  Well, she wasn't that old.  She was only in her 20s, you know?  So, I mean, every kid growing up had a dream, right?  I used to, like, fantasize about my babysitter, so, you know, why not?  Yeah, and I'd like to hear from the women today, because, uh, do the women fantasize about  that crap growing up?  I have no idea.  Uh, probably not.  I don't think so.  They fight it off, is what they have to do. 
[00:09:30]  In the media, it's definitely a double standard, because when it's an older teacher and a young  girl, you know, you look at the teacher and immediately you say, uh, pervert, pedophile,  creep.  Yeah.  But then you see the teacher, and everyone's, like, thinking the same thing, like, where  was she when I was going to school?  Hottie.  Hottie.  Uh, the local Fox News affiliate here is actually showing the Anna Nicole funeral motorcade in  the Bahamas right now.  Oh, yeah.  It's going to be around-the-clock coverage today. 
[00:10:00]  Who cares?  No, that's-that's in the Bahamas.  They're-they're ready to put the rotting corpse on a private jet.  Uh, well, they must have been driving to the airport then, because they just showed the  Bahamas and showed a hearse and a few, uh, limousines, uh, driving on the road.  I think they took it off at 5.30 this morning, so that's about right, right?  Yeah, they were showing an airplane hangar at one point, too.  Like, you know, they were moving her from somewhere.  It's just a corpse-a corpse procession. 
[00:10:30]  This is like-  This is like the O.J. trade, uh, Chase.  Yeah.  The O.J. Chase.  Wanding some rotting meat through security.  Beep, beep.  What's that?  Wire to keep her leg on.  Just a wreck.  It's going through security.  We can't make any exceptions.  We can't make any-so-we're not profiling.  Even dead strippers have to be wanded.  Oh, she looks dead, but how do we, uh, how do we know for sure?  Oh, there's-there it is. 
[00:11:00]  Fort Lauderdale.  Oh, there's the, uh, there's-it's on every channel now.  Every channel's-  There's the body racing down, uh, the freeway.  Oh, it's amazing.  That's what she used to look like.  Oh, and then-  Who wants to see the picture?  And now-  Who wants to see the picture of a dead aunt and a Cole Smith?  I don't want to see it.  You wouldn't-you wouldn't pee?  No.  It would be so gruesome that it would stick with you forever.  You gotta think that-that creepy, uh, medical examiner with the huge freaking thing.  The big goiter on his head.  Yeah, the-the-he has Gumby head. 
[00:11:30]  Gumby head.  You gotta think he's got a few, uh, photos.  Oh, uh, they might make it to the internet.  You gotta think he's got a few photos that he might just, uh, you know, step down from  his gig and sell for a million dollars to the Insider.  The Insider has the exclusive interviews.  You're not gonna-you're not gonna see the interviews anywhere else but the Insider and  Entertainment Tonight.  Could you see them taking her through security and going to take her shoes off and her feet  come off in them?  They put them in the tray. 
[00:12:00]  Anna Nicole's rotting feet through the x-ray machine.  There's just so many gruesome sights.  You gotta sit down next door in first class.  Some rotting body.  Oh, I'm not hungry.  Thank you.  I won't-I'll have nothing.  I bet your body-  Give me a clothespin, please.  It probably feels like a baggie of applesauce.  You looked up her whole body with her clothes on like a little baggie of applesauce. 
[00:12:30]  Ah, what are you gonna do?  That's terrible.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We'll keep you updated.  We'll-we'll-we'll give you this coverage on this breaking news.  Very important.  Very important.  The hearse is in Fort Lauderdale.  So maybe it hasn't taken off yet.  No, I think-well, they're probably, you know, racing, racing to the airport.  Oh, okay.  Meet the plane.  All right.  One-one hearse is racing to the airport and the other one's racing- 
[00:13:00]  to the airport in Florida.  Yeah.  Then they're gonna drop her off.  We're at Bahamas, right?  That's where she's-she's bound for?  Yeah, Bahamas to be buried next to her son.  I think it's at 10.30 this morning.  Oh, well.  And now, the father of Anna Nicole Smith's son wants to exhume the body and take him back  to the States, even though he has had nothing to do with anybody for many, many, many, many years.  There's a wild card.  Because now, because the whole argument was that Anna Nicole wanted to be buried next to 
[00:13:30]  her son, would they have to then dig her up and ship her back to, like, Texas?  Yeah.  If that's where the son's gonna be buried.  Where does he want the son buried?  I don't know.  It's breaking news.  It's the latest in this dumb story in the paper today.  The guy who got Anna Nicole Smith pregnant at, like, 17, and then they pretty much had  nothing to do with each other after that.  Yeah.  Yeah, he wants the son now.  He wants the dead son exhumed.  Well, he does seem to be the next of kin.  Maybe he can do that. 
[00:14:00]  That'd be great.  Just years later, they're still, like, moving-  Moving bodies around?  Ten years from now, and Anna Nicole Smith's body being moved again to Guam.  Is there anything creepier than a body being exhumed, and you see the backhoe in the graveyard?  Oh, yeah.  Digging up some grave.  And then they gotta go, okay, call in the shovels.  We're close enough.  We're close enough.  And then you gotta do the rest by hand.  Until you hear scrape, scrape, scrape, scrape.  Here it is.  Come on, boys. 
[00:14:30]  Get the machinery.  Pull it out.  And then they hoist this just old coffin out of the ground.  There's nothing creepier than that.  After a while, they'll stop moving the coffins.  Like, whenever it's time to move it, they'll just open a coffin and ladle out whatever gunk  is inside of it.  Just bring a ladle and leave the box.  Hey, let's say hi to Scam in New York.  Scam, you're-  Dinty Moore Smith.  This is your Anna Nicole Smith radio station. 
[00:15:00]  That's right.  Get all your Anna Nicole info right here.  What's up?  Don't go anywhere.  What's up, Scam?  Hello, boys.  Hey.  Hi.  The icing on the cake today would be if they were using Anna Nicole as a drug mule.  Just pack her full of drugs.  What the hell?  In that rotting carcass.  Guys, one more thing.  Yeah.  Jimmy Norton, Bananas Tonight, Poe Kipsy, Broncus.  Hey, very good.  Sweet boy, Broncus.  Let's go to Jersey.  We've started a couple different topics here.  We go backwards a little bit. 
[00:15:30]  Chris in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, lost my virginity at age 16 to a paper route customer.  Oh, how hot is that?  It was way hot.  It was a guy.  He didn't say it was a girl.  Was it voluntary or forcible?  Yeah.  Dude, I, like everyone else, pretty much, I had a paper route.  And that was one of my fantasies growing up.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  The famous, you go to collect some money and she comes to the door in some dumb lingerie  thing, trying to cover up, but she can't. 
[00:16:00]  Cover up and she does an oopsie-daisy.  Because there's too much goodness and she can't really cover up.  Oh, I'll be right back.  Oh, let me get some change.  Let me get my checkbook.  So how did it go down, Chris?  Well, I stopped by her house.  Well, first time, I just kissed her.  I just asked her if I could kiss her and she said yes.  And then she was-  All right, hold on, hold on.  What a whore.  Was she an older lady?  Yeah, she was like 35 or 40.  Was she married?  Yeah.  Kids?  Oh, a couple.  Holy crap.  And everyone was out of the house except her? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  It's like they were all on the couch watching.  At 16-  Reading the papers that he was delivering.  Yeah, at 16, that's kind of ballsy to ask her if you could get a kiss.  I was real friggin' horny.  Wow.  Well, apparently so was she.  How did you know, like, there was one woman on my route when I was a kid.  I had a double route.  And I got vibes off her for years.  And, like, she would do little things.  Like, just that the robe would be a little bit open.  It was never anything blatant. 
[00:17:00]  But I never had the balls to actually say, can I touch you or kiss you?  How did you know that she would kiss you, dude?  Well, when he would ride by with the paper and throw it, she was actually bent over in the yard.  She always just had a real nice smile for me.  And I was horny.  So I just went for it.  Yeah.  And she says she had no problem with that.  And then how did it get to the sex thing?  Well, a couple weeks later, I asked her if I could come in.  And she said yes.  And we just sat and talked for a little while. 
[00:17:30]  Was she wearing something sexy at this point?  No, not really.  She had jeans and a sweater on.  Oh, you couldn't sex it up for us?  Yeah, sorry, guys.  You know how many guys are counting on your story today as they drive to work?  And you had to go, nah, jeans and a sloppy sweater.  Yeah, what a wreck that bitch was.  The sweater, it looked like Grandma knitted it one Christmas.  She was wearing a Reds hat and she was dressed like a male nurse.  Right.  And she had bad breath and she smoked a lot and her fingernails and her teeth were yellow.  But still, it was pretty hot, dude. 
[00:18:00]  You know, I was 16.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with exaggerating when you call our radio show.  We'll be completely honest.  Who's going to know?  My bad.  I'll tell you lies from now on.  We don't want to know their lies.  We just want the story.  So I took her shoes off.  She had bunions.  But, you know.  Her feet stunk.  But I was 16.  Oh, it was great.  Right.  All right.  So she's dressed like a mess.  No, she looked good, man.  The sweater was tight.  I started touching her. 
[00:18:30]  And she just took my hand and said, if we're going to do this right, let's go up to the bedroom.  Oh, crap.  So we went up and I peeled off her jeans and pulled off her sweater.  And this was your first time.  Did you just absolutely lose your mind when you saw her naked?  Pretty much, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was crazy.  I didn't last very long at all.  Oh, well, if it was a trampoline, you know, how long?  Five minutes tops.  Five minutes?  Well, that's a lot of jumps, though. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, well, I gave it my best shot.  That's not bad.  Was it only that one time you had sex with her?  Yeah, it was the only time I went with her.  Wow.  So then what happened after that?  Awkward.  We did our thing, and then we took a shower together, and then she kicked me out because  her kids were due home soon.  Wow.  Did you know the kids?  Like, were they friends?  Yeah, I went to high school.  They were brothers and sisters.  Two daughters.  I would have done the daughter, too. 
[00:19:30]  Was it a turn-on to you because you were kind of used by her?  Um, I still remember her fondly and often.  Yeah.  Dude, that's sexy.  Yeah, that's a great story.  Thanks, Chris.  Or maybe it's some kind of weird edible thing.  I don't know.  Not, did you mean edible, sir?  Ediple.  Did you just say edible?  Yeah, I did.  Yeah, it sounded like edible.  I don't know.  I guess Chris isn't smarter than a fifth grader.  All right, Chris, thanks.  Thanks, gentlemen. 
[00:20:00]  Dude, I'm getting turned on thinking about that woman that I used to deliver papers to.  Like, I haven't thought of her in years.  So what's the deal with you, Jimmy?  I don't, nothing ever happened.  I didn't even get vibes of her.  A lot of fantasies in your head, though, right?  It was sickening.  She wore little shorts, and I would always try to catch her, like, just to bend over in the apartment,  just to look at her in her house.  Oh, my God.  Wait, why were you in her house?  She would always invite me, like, up to the front door.  Because her husband knew my mom and dad.  So it wasn't, like, too crazy if I heard her be a little bit more courteous to me.  Because our families, in a weird way, knew each other.  So I could have just been misreading the whole situation.  She could have just been very nice and kind of liking the fact that I was looking at her. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  But I didn't think she ever knew it.  But if she had short shorts on and stuff, you know, I think she knew what she was doing.  I think you're right.  Because she kind of knows when you're coming by, right?  Yeah.  But I was a dork.  Maybe that was her thing, just to kind of, like, show off a little bit.  Yeah.  And that was it.  A little kid with glasses and dandruff.  Get them all into a lather and send them home.  Yeah.  As a kid, you just don't know.  Like, that guy obviously had some moves.  Could pick up on the vibe and stuff.  I remember as a kid in California, I couldn't, like, pick up on any of those vibes or anything. 
[00:21:00]  And there was this woman.  She was an Injun.  Injun squaw.  A squaw.  Hey, squaw.  Hey, hey, hey.  We learned this week that's an insult.  They're trying to ban the word squaw, you know.  Back in those days, they called him squaw.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking about.  1880.  And she was, we were hanging out at some ranch, and there was another party going on, of course.  And she was there with her husband, who was hanging out.  He wasn't away or anything. 
[00:21:30]  He was hanging out at this party.  And so I went around back to use the facilities, use the bathroom that was around the back of the trailer that was there.  And there was a big pile of hay.  And she was laying in the hay.  And she was all hammered.  And she said, she goes, hey, how about a roll in the hay, you know.  And you had no idea what that meant?  No, I knew what it meant.  And I knew what she wanted to do.  But all I could think of, like, it was blatant. 
[00:22:00]  It was like that blatant.  So it wasn't like I had to figure anything out or see if she was throwing off a vibe.  But the only thing I remember is her husband looked and acted like Billy Bear from 48 Hours.  Oh, boy.  The Indian with the knife.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I was like, no.  And I actually ran away.  I ran away for fear that even being seen in that situation would get me stabbed.  Did you run up into an apple tree?  No, not into an apple tree. 
[00:22:30]  But that was the same place that I got a joke played on me by this guy, Jimmy Jackson.  Yeah.  Jimmy Jackson, I used to run his rent string.  You know, he used to have a bunch of about 20 horses.  And he'd take them out on the weekends and tie them up to the hitching post.  We used to have to put saddles on them and stuff.  Me and Homo Richard had to put saddles on them.  And then the Marines from Camp Pendleton come and want to ride a horse for an hour or so.  So we'd have to take them up in the hills and, you know, show them the trails and stuff.  So as I'm working there, one day Jimmy says, well, I got to go up to Chino or something. 
[00:23:00]  He's going away for the day.  But Patty's here, which is his wife.  And she was a skinny blonde girl.  And she was, he goes, but she's inside.  So don't, you know, don't worry about it.  She's sleeping.  So I came inside to get something to drink.  And I hear a voice from the room going, hey, what are you doing out there?  Come here a minute.  And so I walk in there and she's got the sheets barely covering her. 
[00:23:30]  And she goes, she goes, did Jimmy leave?  Jimmy Jackson, the guy.  I was like, yeah.  She goes, why don't you hop in?  And I was like, there is no way.  There is no way.  I go very flat.  I'm using things like very flattered.  But there's no way I can do that.  Because Jimmy loved guns.  Ooh, did Jimmy love guns.  So I was like, no, there's no way I could do that.  And she was really coaxing me, trying to get me into bed with her.  And I just would not do it. 
[00:24:00]  And finally, the joke was, I kind of ruined the bit.  Because Jimmy burst out of the closet with his shotgun.  Oh, wow.  And chased me out of the house.  But I hadn't gotten into bed.  So if I did, he would have been in there with the shotgun to chase me out as a joke.  But then he wouldn't have been able to trust me either.  Yeah.  The joke's over.  But now, you know.  The joke's over.  Yeah, yeah.  You still got to live your life.  And he's thinking, holy crap.  I can't leave this guy alone now.  That would have backfired. 
[00:24:30]  But oh, it scared the crap out of me still.  How old were you in The Lady with the Hay?  That was probably 14, around there somewhere.  No, that brings up something pretty interesting.  I wonder how many times during our lives right here, and maybe some of the guys and gals listening right now,  where somebody was hinting that was older, like they would have banged you as a kid and you had no idea.  And you just didn't pick up on it.  And I don't mean as a kid, kid.  But, you know, in those years when you were really starting to figure everything out,  where you would have definitely, you know, went for it and there would have been no psychological consequences. 
[00:25:00]  I was already active at that point.  It wasn't like it was, you know, oh my goodness, what are we doing?  Right.  Was I the only one who caught that the paper boy was 16 when that happened?  It's like, why don't you're a little old for a paper?  I don't know.  Paper boy.  I was caddying at that point.  My God.  That's the paper man.  Yeah.  Ma'am, I got your paper.  It's your paper.  Sure.  Brenda.  Yeah, hi.  All right.  I think we have time for you.  We've got to take a break.  But you're from Pittsburgh. 
[00:25:30]  You're a teacher.  What's going on?  Nothing.  I'm 23.  I'm a teacher.  And I previously taught 9th and 11th grade.  So, I mean, I know these kids and I know what they're like.  And I just don't think I would ever appreciate that awkward, disgusting teenager on my trampoline, personally.  No.  I think teachers that do, I don't know.  I think there's something wrong with them.  Something serious on many levels wrong with them.  Of course.  You know, it's an epidemic, though, man.  It seems like almost every, well, at least every week there's a teacher somewhere getting busted for this. 
[00:26:00]  I know.  And, like, being a young teacher, and I'm an English teacher, and it seems like it's always us.  I don't know why, but, I mean, I feel like I can't even do my job.  You know, it interferes with it.  It's everywhere.  Have you had kids hit on you?  Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, you've got to kind of, like, nip it in the bud.  But it happens, yeah.  Well, how'd they hit on you?  Yeah, well, what's hitting on you?  In the bud.  Okay.  I mean, like, the moment it happens, you have to be like, uh, no. 
[00:26:30]  But how'd they hit on you?  You know, they'll just, like, stay after class and, like, hang around a little while and, like, stop and talk to you in the hallway.  It's like, you know, between classes, it's just, like, you and them.  Are you one of these teachers that shows off the cleavage?  No.  She goes, no!  Oh, my God!  Not in school.  Well, I had teachers that showed off the cleavage, so I want to know what that's about now. 
[00:27:00]  I don't know.  I mean, I see teachers that do.  I don't get it.  I don't know.  All right, Brenda.  Thank you.  I know we're going to break, but I was a grazer.  Like, I would bump into girls' asses with the back of my knuckle and, like, then go home and put that in the filing cabinet.  And it's called frottage, and I did it to a teacher one time.  It was just me and her by the pool.  It's a name for it?  Frottage?  Yeah, it's like accidental bumping.  Like, when you bump either your hand or your genitals against a person on purpose in a public situation.  It's, like, a really antisocial thing to do.  Well, yeah. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  But, I mean, like, the accidental contact you do.  And I would always go home and go through the Rolodex of where I bumped my arm.  Like, did I get one cheek or two cheeks?  And I got a team.  And that would really get you going?  Beyond comprehension.  That's so weird.  I got a teacher one time.  She was standing by the pool in her swimsuit.  Just me and her, and I walked too close and grazed both cheeks with my knuckle.  And you've never felt somebody stare at you.  I felt her turn around.  And if I were to turn around, she would have me thrown out of school.  But I kept walking, and she didn't say anything.  See, in my high school, we started this thing called ETs. 
[00:28:00]  But it wasn't as much as a turn-on as it was just like, you know, look what I got away with.  Can you do it?  Yeah.  And then it continued in the bars.  You know, back then, you know, drinking age was 18, so you're still young.  And one of the things you would do, walking through a crowded bar, is to see how many  ETs you could get.  You had to bump it.  Elbow blanks.  Yeah, you had to bump your elbow into the girl's rest.  But it was more like, you know, you would laugh with the guys, like, look, look, you know,  I'm going in for an E.T. 
[00:28:30]  E.T., look.  That's more of an assault.  Yeah.  Well, you wouldn't like elbow, like you're playing, you know, roller derby.  Ram your elbow, sharp elbow into her.  It would be similar to what you did, a little brush with the elbow.  She's crying.  A whole line of guys hitting her, like, full metal jacket.  Poof, poof.  There you go.  It's just a bad dream, fat girl.  Bam.  Wow, the phone's lit from all over the country.  We love seeing this because this is a very interactive show. 
[00:29:00]  All right, we're off to a good start.  We'll keep you updated with the end of Nicole Smith, body moving.  Well, we've got to talk about the med guy getting found naked.  Yeah.  Also, we really have a lot to do.  Are we going after the Wake Up Club again today?  I think they're monitoring the Wake Up Club again today.  Yeah, some new developments.  New developments, yes.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, wait till you hear this one, Jimmy.  That's a good one.  Wait till you hear this one.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about. 
[00:29:30]  O&A Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe.  Now, this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, good morning.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  I want to thank Chris.  Chris Shoplock from Jersey.  Thanks, Chris.  I'm starting my own army.  The Opie army.  Oh.  Uh-oh. 
[00:30:00]  You can't.  Divide and conquer.  You can't.  Nah, I got to start an army.  No.  We need an army.  No, we're just joking because that could be a pit, you know.  I just want to thank Chris for the kind words on instant feedback.  Let's say hi to Jake in Pittsburgh.  What's going on, Jake?  Jake.  Hey.  Not too much, guys.  I had an incident like the ones you guys were talking about, only mine was, I don't know  how to describe it.  It was almost like, it was probably the best thing that happened to me when I was a teenager. 
[00:30:30]  It could be the best thing that ever happened to you.  Yeah, probably will be.  It says that you slept with the manager at Wendy's when you were 16.  Yeah, I had a job there, you know.  It was my first job.  I was 16 and I was kind of rebellious, you know.  I was in a band and I was always getting in trouble with my older manager.  He was this freaky old 40-year-old guy that liked to tell us about how he liked transvestites.  With Dave Thomas?  Imagine.  No, but Wendy's was actually a son. 
[00:31:00]  Right.  Wendy's was like a shrine to Dave Thomas.  There are pictures of him on all the walls and he's always looking at you all creepy with  a spatula.  Yeah.  But, so I used to get in trouble a lot because I used to, you know, I'd fight back at him.  We had this one manager.  She was about 25.  She was still in college for some reason, even though she was 25.  But she was pretty good looking.  And I'd kind of gotten the vibe a couple of times from, you know, talking to her and working  next to her that she was kind of into me.  So, one day I end up getting in trouble and she's the one that has to yell at me. 
[00:31:30]  So, she takes me back into the freezer.  Because, you know, that's the most private area to yell at one of your employees.  And she's like, the only reason I brought you back here was because I was supposed to  yell at you.  And she's like, but I don't want to yell at you.  And I was like, oh, all right.  That's kind of cool, I guess, you know.  So, you know, one thing leads to another and we start talking.  And she's like, so, you have a break coming up, right?  And I was like, yeah.  And she's like, well, I'm done at six.  She's like, do you want to meet me outside?  How old was she?  She's like 25. 
[00:32:00]  16, 25.  That's nice.  That's perfect right there.  And, you know, she's like, so can you meet me, you know, outside during her break?  And I'm like, yeah, that's cool, I guess so.  So I end up, you know, showing up outside and she starts talking to me about my band  and making small talk to me.  And she's like, hey, do you want to go for a ride?  And at the time, you know, I was smoking pot, so I figured that's what she wanted.  So we start going for a ride and she pulls into the parking lot behind, you know, the  mall that we'd worked at.  And she starts talking to me and starts touching my leg. 
[00:32:30]  And, you know, the next thing I know, she's on top of me, putting her tongue down my throat.  And I'm, you know, I'm pretty into it.  So one thing leads to another, and the next thing I know, she's on top of me, and we're  having sex in the parking lot.  On top of me?  Yeah.  I don't like how you say meh.  She's on top of me.  On top of me.  I'm smoking pot.  I'm smoking pot.  Sorry.  No, it's cool, man.  Good story.  Yeah, it's 25, 16, and she just needed it.  She needed it bad.  So we end up, you know, doing it.  And about halfway through, the mall cleaning people come through. 
[00:33:00]  They clean around the mall in their washer truck or whatever the hell it is.  Dude, I know now why you're delivering so much.  Right, because he's listening to himself.  You're listening, and there's a slight delay that's messing everything up.  It's screwing up your cadence.  Yeah, it's just, it's, when you guys talk, it's really weird, because I don't know when.  All right, listen, listen.  So the cleanup crew comes by.  They catch you.  What's going on?  So they catch us, and, you know, they start giving us shit, telling us to leave, or they're  called the cops.  Oh, boy. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Signed up leaving.  So wait, hold on.  Do they give you crap, tell you they're going to call the cops?  Yeah.  Okay.  So I end up getting back to work, and I'm working.  After work, she shows up again.  So I'm thinking, all right, I'm going to get late again.  So, you know, we start doing this.  Then what happened?  Yeah.  Well, for two weeks, we'd done this every day after work.  And then she starts getting way too into me.  I mean, I'm 16.  I just wanted sex.  I didn't want to.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Then what happened? 
[00:34:00]  Well, every day at work then, she started, like, let's hang out and do this and that.  And whenever I'd say no, she was, you know, starting the whole, well, then I guess I won't  be working here anymore.  So it didn't really work out too well.  But, you know.  And after that, what happened?  I pretty much quit my job and went a separate way.  But no job was ever as good after that, you know?  Then what happened?  That was pretty much it.  But it was a good time.  No, like, after that, what happened?  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  When you left the job, what happened?  Nothing, really.  I got a new job and went to college.  Oh.  You got a new job and went to college.  Then what happened?  I called you guys.  That's pretty much it.  All right.  Thanks, Jake.  Yeah.  I called you guys.  You got out of it.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  We got breaking news as far as the wake-up club goes.  Now, we got to bring everyone up to speed.  Oh, God.  Everyone's going to be so angry.  Hey, I didn't explain the apple tree line earlier. 
[00:35:00]  Good.  That could have been five minutes right there.  So relax.  There's a little radio group.  They only own two radio stations, it comes down to?  Apparently, two radio stations.  Red Wolf.  Red Wolf Broadcasting.  They're kind of scared of us, I guess, because we're going to be competing.  We are competing against their stations.  Yeah.  So they're trying to make a big to-do about us and say that we're smut peddlers.  Yeah.  We're pornographers.  Yeah.  We get Plogola from having our listeners go to our websites to check out hardcore porn. 
[00:35:30]  Download porno and we get money from it somehow.  Yeah.  Like, they just made all these allegations against our show and they're trying to keep  the deal between ABC and Citadel from going down.  So they're grabbing at straws here.  So one of the straws is our show.  They say if our show is going to be broadcast on Citadel and then on ABC, if that deal goes 
[00:36:00]  through, it's not in the public interest because what we do is we peddle smut.  Yeah.  And Citadel, by hiring us for some of their stations, they're showing irresponsibility because  they're playing with fire by hiring the Opie and Anthony show.  When children are going to school, these two are talking about websites that have smut  on it.  Really?  So we decided to take a look at their fine organization and some of their radio shows. 
[00:36:30]  And we've been all over Glenn and Rebecca, the wake-up club.  And we also got some breaking news yesterday.  Tom Chiasano calling everybody.  Oh, great.  He was so excited yesterday afternoon.  It was great.  And apparently some lawyers did a little peeking, some peering in the way they do, and uncovered  something very interesting.  Yes.  Exposed this broadcasting company, Red Wolf, for being hypocrites.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They found that one of their stations is a hip-hop station. 
[00:37:00]  They only have two, right?  Yeah.  They only have two.  They have the one with this ridiculous morning show that just sucks.  There's a hip-hop station, apparently, that's just staffed with white people.  That's great.  What kind of credibility do you have?  Wait, they have a hip-hop station that's staffed with white people?  White people.  There's one black on-air personality.  Yeah.  One black person there.  And the rest are white.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  That's hip-hop.  And apparently, that station's website contained links to porn sites. 
[00:37:30]  Tom called us so excited.  You're not going to believe what our lawyers found out.  The lawyers had uncovered this.  I believe they got some screen caps.  Yeah, unfortunately.  But they had taken it down since because they realized, uh-oh, look at what we got.  Well, because we made a big to-do about this whole thing yesterday.  So they started focusing on their own websites and went, oh, my God, we got porn.  So they got rid of the links. 
[00:38:00]  But our fine lawyers down in Washington got screen caps and all sorts of stuff.  They said it doesn't matter what site you're on at any given moment.  You are two clicks away from pornography.  You make two of the right clicks, you're there.  Yeah.  You're there.  Porno.  So apparently, they had it right on their page, though.  There you go.  It was great.  And they're accusing us of-  Is that the hip-hop lineup?  That's the hip-hop lineup.  Holy Jesus.  It looks like the opening of the Brady Bunch, like when they do 30 year later specials. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  It's all white people in little squares.  There's no blacks.  Is that girl black or is she just tan?  She's barely black.  She's Halle Berry black.  Because that's the safe kind of black, by the way.  That girl is barely black.  If you're going to hire black, that's like a safe black to hire.  Do you mean the one that looks like-  In the white world.  The one that looks like Don Ho over Fat Eric?  That one?  Yeah, yeah.  So you got Miss L in the mornings, and then you got Kid David, and then you got Lisa Evans. 
[00:39:00]  She's the Halle Berry black.  Very safe.  Right.  And then you got Chum the Skrilla Gorilla.  What?  He's a fat white guy.  Yeah.  Chum the Skrilla Gorilla.  They wouldn't call a hip-hop guy that name, probably.  No.  A real hip-hop guy.  He'd have to be white, or it would be a derogatory term.  But we're more obsessed with Glenn and Rebecca from the Wake Up Club.  And we got breaking news as far as Rebecca goes.  Well, I'm looking at some information that has come in. 
[00:39:30]  Mm-hmm.  And, well, you remember yesterday we were talking about her little run-in with the law that she had.  I guess she hit a strip club.  Well, apparently she was-  Left the scene of the accident, and she got caught because she left a license plate behind.  Well, she had hit a cab first.  Yeah.  Slightly injuring the driver, and then careened into a strip club.  Mm-hmm.  And then left that scene, but apparently left her license plate behind. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  And they were able to find her.  It's kind of easy when you got the license plate.  And she refused to, as the police said, as she was failing her sobriety test,  she then refused to take the breathalyzer test.  And it went to court, and I guess she pled it down to a leaving the scene of an accident  and some other minor charge instead of the driving while intoxicated.  And got off the hook kind of for that one, but she was fired from Clear Channel 
[00:40:30]  and got this other job here now at this light station.  But we are looking at the criminal record here of Rebecca-  Of the Glenn and-  Jay-  Of the Glenn and Rebecca show.  Morse.  Yeah.  It's got a date of birth.  She was born in 73.  She's only-  She's younger than I am?  Yeah.  What?  Yeah.  She did-  What does she do? 
[00:41:00]  Do farming in Arizona?  How does she look that old?  That's what happens.  She looks like an old grammar school teacher.  When you chug down booze and slam into strip clubs.  I swear to God, I thought she was in her early 50s.  Yeah, easy.  Yeah, yeah.  That's kind of what it looked like.  That's about what-  What is she, 74?  73 is-  That's 34.  She's 34 years old.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Isn't that something?  Couple years older than I.  Uh, female, uh, eye color, um, uh, brown, I guess, uh, hair, brown. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, she dyes it.  Um, no alias shown here.  Got an address.  Alias the hole.  Alias the hole.  Here it is, criminal record from Rhode Island administration of courts.  Description, receiving stolen goods greater than $500.  What is that about?  I don't know.  Disposition, plea of nolo contendary. 
[00:42:00]  A no contest?  That's a no contest.  Uh, degree of offense, misdemeanor.  I guess they kind of, you know, plead that down.  Uh, and, uh, that would have been on, uh, in 94.  Seems in 94, she was a bad girl.  Hmm.  Seems 38 and it's in 94, so 21 years old.  Yeah, a little wild, a little wild chick.  Yeah.  Now she just sits there giggling away with, uh, her poor bastard partner that's got to 
[00:42:30]  sit there and listen to her drivel.  Well, we got, uh, today's sample of their show.  Please.  Here's the Wake Up Club with Glenn and Rebecca.  What are they talking about as we, uh, do our show?  It's a parody of a radio show.  That's the only way you can describe this.  But they're, they're serious.  This is, this isn't a joke or a bit.  Yeah.  Soundfrock 106.5 WBMW on the Wake Up Club with Glenn and Rebecca at 613.  It's Two Doors Down.  Yes. 
[00:43:00]  It works.  I don't know what is Two Doors Down from here.  Well, the, the men's room, actually.  The bar.  There you go.  Good morning, Glenn.  Good morning and welcome to Friday.  Yeah, we've made it.  We have one a week.  Yeah.  I say that a lot.  Like, what a week.  Oh, it's not that bad, is it?  Well, you know, you know, it's, it's Friday, so it's all behind us.  That's right.  A couple of weeks, a couple of, uh, weekend days to just kind of mellow out.  There you go.  Boring. 
[00:43:30]  This sucks.  Oh, wow.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop it.  Stop whining.  Quiet.  Wow.  This sucks.  Wow.  This sucks.  Oh, wow.  Oh, is that horrible?  That's all they got?  Do they realize they're broadcasting that?  Does anybody remember last night?  I was only joking.  Kiss my fat ass.  All right, relax. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, is, oh, that drivel is horrific.  They can't converse.  No.  By the way, you know, when you're, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good  idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.  Oh, they're wishing they didn't write that little petition at this point.  Yeah.  The stupid broadcast company.  Hey, it's Friday.  It stinks, and I don't like it.  You want to hear a little more?  A little more?  A little more?  Dude, I could listen to this all day.  I want to be in Best Of and just listen to their show.

I want to play along with them now.  Well, you know what?  We just took that break, and we're helping them out.  We're making it more entertaining.  That exact break you heard.  If they did it this way, then people would be listening.  Oh, okay. 
[00:45:30]  Coming up at 6.20 this morning.  We've got your celebrity gossip.  We'll talk a little bit about Anna Nicole Smith's s*** today and American Idol.  Wow.  All that and a lot more.

E-Rock has a picture up on the screen, and I've got to say, who is that fat pig in the straw hat?  That is Rebecca.  That's Rebecca?  What happened to the publicity shot?  Wow.  Looks like that's why she looks so young.  They got a younger picture of her or something.  Is that a new picture?  No.  It's a year ago.  That's a year ago?  What a year ago.  Wow.  What happened? 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, she's got problems.  So she...  I'm thinking she's got some problems.  She's got some issues.  Dropped some weight, I guess.  She looks like Hannibal Lecter in the last scene of Silence of the Lambs.  With the wig on.  Having an old friend for dinner.  Walking down the street.  All right.  Listen, we've got to play a little catch-up today.  So why don't we take a break?  We'll get into some other things in just a bit.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right. 
[00:47:00]  It's Friday.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  What a week.  What a week.  What a week.  Oh, boy.  Can't wait for the weekend.  Couple days off.  Rock, rock, rock, rock.  Rock, rock.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Lots to do before we get to the weekend here.  Where to go, where to go, where to go.  What are your brain buster today?  Well, well, what?  What's their brain buster?  I want to know what their brain buster is.  God, that's got me...  All right.  I'm captivated.  All right.  It's her bumper.  Her grill. 
[00:47:30]  Well, you could be listening to us, or you could be listening to the Wake Up Club.  If you're listening to the Wake Up Club, you get this.  The ONA release.  Soft rock, 106.5, breakfast brain buster.  Yes, we have a morning trivia question in the midst of all this.  Yes, and having to do with, somewhat with our celebrity gossip.  All you need to do today is just name one person who got kicked off American Idol last night.  So if you were paying attention, say, 15 minutes ago...  Or if you watched American Idol.  Yeah.  But we're glad to distill it all down for you in the morning here on the Wake Up Club. 
[00:48:00]  To win a certificate to Irene's Family Restaurant from Soft Rock 106.5, WBMW.  Oh, Jesus.  To Irene's?  You know, the only breakfast club I want involved with these two is the same type you beat baby seals over the head with.  I want to walk into their studio with a breakfast club and bludgeon them. 
[00:48:30]  Can we start this break over?  Can I have that time back, please?  That was fantastic.  Come on.  They probably gave the info and then you're listening, but you don't know I should be listening.  Right.  That makes you listen closely to what they're saying because you don't know if it's going to be part of their big brain buster.  Well, I think John Minnelli was right.  You really shouldn't be talking about American Idol on your radio show.  No.  Unless something fantastic happened.  Unless maybe there's sex pictures of a girl. 
[00:49:00]  Sex pictures is good.  That's a good excuse.  Actually, American Idol was really, really good last night because finally...  I've only been watching American Idol for a couple seasons.  Finally, the person that got kicked off...  When you get kicked off, you've got to sing the song that wasn't good enough to stay on the show, which I think is hilarious, by the way.  Yeah, they make you sing the one that got you kicked off.  Why would you do that?  I always thought that was kind of strange.  And finally, last night, the first time in two years, the girl gets kicked off.  What's her name?  Elena. 
[00:49:30]  Like anyone's going to remember after today.  Who cares?  Who cares?  And...  Naga, Naga, Naga be on the show no more.  Right.  Celebrate his entire catalog.  See?  Fans laughing.  Some Office Space fans here.  Oh, okay.  Office Space.  And so she sings a song that got her kicked off.  The first contestant to break down and she can't sing.  Yeah.  And that made me very, very happy last night.  Oh, it's great.  So here's Elena crying through her last performance on American Idol before she goes back to a nobody. 
[00:50:00]  Here's Elena on the stage one more time.  I'm going to wait a minute.  I'm going to try my next one.  Yeah.  I'm going to try my next one.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I'm going to try my next one.  I'm going to try my next one.  And I'm not sure what they say.  Sorry. 
[00:50:30]  The backup singers had to take over the song here.  Oh, God.  Stop whining. 
[00:51:00]  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!  Stop it!  You like discipline.  That's terrific. That's terrific.  How did you do that, jerk? 
[00:51:30]  Stop it!  Oh, yeah.  And I'll be waiting.  Don't you do it!  Don't!  You!  I got nowhere else to go!  That finally happened, though.  I've been waiting for that moment.  Because I'm like, man, they're getting kicked off this hugely popular show. 
[00:52:00]  And kind of hold it together.  And they hold it together as they're getting kicked off.  But finally, last night, she broke down.  It's terrible. I'm sorry.  And the backup singers, I said it during the clip, they had to, like, take over the song.  Because she just started crying and turned around and started hugging her fellow contestants.  You can act like a man!  And the producers are sitting there like, we still have a show to do.  So they pointed to the backup singers, and they took the lead vocal for a while and got it back together for the last part. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, was she hugging the contestants during that part?  Yeah, she just broke down.  She couldn't do it anymore.  And she turned around, balling, and just started hugging everybody.  Throw the mic down.  Curse.  They're all embarrassed.  They get right.  Yeah.  And they kept the hot...  I'm still here.  Who cares?  They kept the hot chick on the show that sucks so bad.  She's the worst singer among all of them, but two others got kicked off.  You know, she didn't get kicked off.  Two others did.  You know, the one with all the R-rated shots on the internet.  The one embroiled in a sex scandal.  What is her name again?  Antonella Barba. 
[00:53:00]  She should have been sent home.  But America's voting for her because she's a hot piece of ass, and she's got great photos on the internet to check out.  America loves her.  Yeah, that's the only reason that she is still on the show.  Hoping more pictures surface.  Absolutely.  That's why they want to keep her on the show.  And she has a sexy name, too, man.  That's a sexy name.  Antonella Barba?  Yeah.  I think...  Trip her name.  I think we should try to put her over.  I don't know what kind of power we have these days.  Yeah.  We should get our listeners to vote for her every week because it would be hilarious if she wins the whole thing with that awful voice of hers. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, she can't sing.  She's nowhere near the best vocalist in the competition.  But anyway, speaking of Antonella Barba, before we move on from idle chat, stupid Glenn Beck put his foot in his mouth.  Listen to this.  He was talking to some girl from U.S. Weekly about this contestant with the photos on the internet.  Yeah.  And he had this cute little thing to say.  Who's Glenn Beck?  I don't know.  I think he's a talk show host that got a TV show now, I think. 
[00:54:00]  Is that it, right?  Yeah.  The minute you go on American Idol or want a career as a singer, people are going to look into your past and find these kind of photos and post them everywhere.  Let me tell you.  Which is what happened.  Dina, let me tell you something.  I don't think you have to be famous.  I think you just work in the average environment in America now.  Well, somebody would get a picture of you and then it would be posted all around and it'll happen in your office.  Yeah.  Possibly.  You don't think so?  Well, it depends.  Dina, I've got some time and a camera. 
[00:54:30]  Why don't you stop by?  No.  Okay.  Do you think that with American Idol, this is really...  And then he tries to...  One of the boss things.  You know.  Wow.  He had no exit strategy.  Wow.  No exit strategy.  Trying to flirt as Alzar Kawi's got his hair and a poor sword out.  Wow. 
[00:55:00]  Just dead silence.  Dead silence from her.  How great is that clip?  Perfect.  It is, right?  What a dope.  Little douche chili.  All right.  What is the breakfast...  Oh, brother.  Let's say hi to Rich in Staten Island.  Rich!  Yeah, what is this?  The breakfast club?  I get to listen to American Idol on the radio?  Yeah.  Hey, Rich.  It's the wake-up club, Rich.  It's the wake-up club.  Oh, okay.  Not the breakfast club. 
[00:55:30]  Good morning.  We're the wake-up club.  You don't find it entertaining to listen to a girl completely breaking down as she's getting  kicked off American Idol?  We're not discussing who was the best vocalist or any of that crap.  And then the cleverly added-in audience laughing at her when she starts breaking down.  Come on.  And then that clip of Glenn Beck saying that he wants to take dirty pictures of this girl  that's like a professional that's on his show?  She just sits there staring at him blankly, wondering if she should have him arrested. 
[00:56:00]  Right.  Miss Allred, did you hear my joke, Miss Allred?  All right.  Maybe Rich would like this a little better.  This is the story of the day.  The arrest itself of a middle school principal selling drugs out of his office.  Well, that's unbelievable and bizarre enough.  All right.  So we got a middle school, I believe, principal.  Yes.  Yep.  Selling drugs...  Oh, my God.  ...out of his office at school.  Oh, my God.  Right there. 
[00:56:30]  Stop the story.  That has to be the end of it.  There you go.  What a horrible, horrible guy he is.  I hope he's arrested and put away.  There you go.  Worst story of the day, right?  A horrible story.  It gets better.  Well, it bizarre enough.  But what we've learned tonight, some police sources say, is shocking.  Well, I'm not going to comment on the circumstances of his arrest.  But it's the circumstances during the arrest of 50-year-old John Ossera that makes this case incredibly bizarre.  As we first reported, police arrested the Nitsman Middle School principal on drug charges at his office Tuesday night. 
[00:57:00]  But that's only part of the story.  Tonight, police sources tell me cops were shocked and in disbelief when they stormed his office.  Sources say not only did they find drugs, money, and a pipe...  Drugs, money, and a pipe.  So he's selling the drugs and he's smoking the drugs.  And he's smoking right in his office.  Right in his office.  That's horrible.  There you go.  All right.  I hope he's arrested.  I hope we find out he's just arrested and taken out of that school because that's horrible. 
[00:57:30]  How outrageous is that?  That's pretty outrageous.  And like they said, the cops said, that is shocking.  Middle school principal.  I'm shocked.  Oh, it gets better.  ...trugs, money, and a pipe.  They also found a Sarah completely nude.  Oh, my God.  Completely nude.  Oh.  All right.  He's completely nude.  So you got a middle school principal selling drugs from his office.  He's smoking the drugs.  When they found him, he was completely nude.  That is shocking. 
[00:58:00]  Story of the day.  America beat that.  I thought it was shocking enough when he was just selling drugs out of his office.  Yeah.  But nude.  Nude.  Shocked.  Not going to get a better story than that today, people.  Nope, that's it.  All right.  Nope, it gets better.  Move on to the next.  Oh, what?  It gets better.  Oh, my goodness.  ...money and a pipe.  They also found a Sarah completely nude.  And watching gay porn.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Now we got a middle school principal selling drugs out of his office. 
[00:58:30]  Out of his office.  He's smoking the drugs besides selling them.  He's got the pipe and the money in there.  And the cops burst.  And he's nude.  Oh, is that horrible.  Watching gay porn.  Watching gay porn.  I forgot about that part already.  There's so much.  Watching the gay porn.  Watching gay porn.  All right.  Finally, we can move on.  Well, that's it.  Story of the day.  Well, what's the next story we can hit and talk about?  Because obviously that one has to be over.  There's more.  There's more.  There's more. 
[00:59:00]  What do we got so far?  Middle school.  Principal.  Yes.  Drugs selling them out of his office.  Yes.  Found a pipe and money.  So he was smoking them.  So he's smoking the drugs.  Oh, my God.  He's naked.  He's naked.  When the cops come in.  He's nude.  He's watching gay porno.  Right.  Oh, my God.  This is outrageous.  How could this get any better?  It can't.  You may ask.  I want to bet that it can't get any worse than that.  And they better not dump out.  This is a new story.  ...fully nude and watching gay porn with sex toys in his possession. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, no.  The arrested self of a...  What part of the body is the possession?  One hand holding the emotive.  Wait a minute.  Sex toys in his possession.  In his possession.  There is the story of the morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Wow.  Why are the binoculars out?  Who handed you those binoculars?  I asked for them because I wanted to look at something without...  Get a confirmation, Jimmy.  Before I said anything, I wanted to look.  Prove if that's male or female. 
[01:00:00]  We're looking through a bathroom window, and it is a frosted window, but it's opened a little  bit.  So on the bottom, you can see a clear view.  I think that's a girl.  Binoculars, please.  Thank you.  All right.  Hold on.  I'm looking through...  Looking backwards.  Just stay out of the way.  Here we go.  Here we go.  I'm looking.  Let me see.  That is... 
[01:00:30]  Oh, I'm seeing...  I think I see an ass.  I saw a hair waving around.  I think it's a chick.  I'm not willing to commit yet.  Could be a rocker.  Get out of the way.  Who's in my way?  Bastards.  Stupid binoculars.  They're making me dizzy.  Yeah, they will do that.  I can't tell.  I know.  I'm looking at a brick wall.  I know.  I can't.  I'm trying to zero in on the window. 
[01:01:00]  I'm looking at a plant.  I'm looking at...  You guys would make great snipers.  No kidding, man.  You get the enemy in your sights.  You finally get them in your sights, and you fall over and faint.  Dude, I'm trying to, like, zero in on this window, and I see everything else but the  only window that is lit up right now.  Oh, now I'm looking at it the wrong way, so it's really far away.  All right.  I can't make it out.  The window is open about six inches, and it's a frosted window, so the six inches that's 
[01:01:30]  going by, I can't tell what it is.  Oh, it's a girl.  I see a bra.  You see a bra?  Yes, we have brassiere.  I can't even find a goddamn window.  Oh, wait.  She just shut the window.  She just shut the window on us.  All right.  She shut the window on us.  I couldn't find the window.  Dude, tease.  How could you not find a window that is across one street with binoculars?  Because binoculars stink.  They really do stink.  They shake.  Dude.  Like, it's the wall.  It's the light. 
[01:02:00]  You know, as they magnify the image, they also magnify the movement, so it's very hard  to focus in, Jimmy, but any idiot can see the window from this far away.  Well, I couldn't.  Dude, I'm carsick.  You carsick.  I'm in the middle of a radio show, and I'm now carsick.  I'm not even kidding you, man.  You got a little woozy.  I think I got to go puke now.  You got a little woozy.  They handed me the binoculars.  Like, Jimmy, we're trying to focus.  I'm looking at a plant. 
[01:02:30]  I'm looking at the sky at one point.  I actually had to hit the railing on the top of floor above it and then work my way down.  And walk your way down.  And the great part is it's in the corner.  So all you had to do is get the corner in your field of view and just walk it down, and  you'd have been at the window.  Well, I didn't think of that.  I was too busy getting all flustered.  You were all flustered.  I can't see.  God damn it.  And then I'm shaking because I'm trying to, like, you know, get it in view before she,  like, closes the window or starts dressing. 
[01:03:00]  Got a little nervous.  I have no idea what I just saw.  How does anybody whack their bag holding binoculars?  How do you do that?  It's impossible.  You need a telescope on a tripod.  Yeah.  I think I saw Bigfoot.  I don't know what I saw.  Yeah, it was something.  I have no idea.  I saw her.  She was wearing a black bra.  All right.  Where were we?  So a middle school teacher selling drugs from the office, smoking the drugs from his office,  found naked, watching gay porn with, uh, with, uh, with, uh, I'm trying to clean up.  With sex toys.  Are we allowed to say sex toys? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, sex toys.  Marital AIDS, whatever.  Yeah, sex toys in his possession.  Bert for Philly has a great idea.  Let's start a story of the month club.  Oh, that's a good one.  Let's start a story of the month.  And then you try to top it.  And, uh, Philly takes a huge.  That's your brain buster.  And Bert's saying Philly takes a huge early lead.  This story's out of Philly?  Wow.  Is this out of Philly?  Is it?  Does anyone know?  I don't know.  Let's listen again.  The arrest itself of a middle school principal selling drugs out of his office.  Well, that's unbelievable and bizarre enough. 
[01:04:00]  But what we've learned tonight, some police sources say, is shocking.  Well, I'm not going to comment on the circumstances.  It's a police force.  But it's the circumstances during the arrest of 50-year-old John Massara that makes this case incredibly bizarre.  As we first reported, police arrested the Nitsman Middle School principal on drug charges at his office Tuesday night.  But that's only part of the story.  Tonight, police sources tell me cops were shocked and in disbelief when they stormed his office.  Sources say not only did they find drugs, money, and a pipe, they also found a Sarah completely nude and watching gay porn with sex toys in his possession. 
[01:04:30]  It's in the hole!  I see the awful, terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.  Was that supposed to be sexy?  Yeah!  Well, that's from Allentown, PA.  So, uh, I like Bert's idea from Philly.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[01:05:00]  Ma!  Please stop calling me!  Put your hands up.  Could you unclench, sir?  Put that down.  Thank you.  Unclench.  Mom!  I'm not going to lower it!  I have to do this now!  Gentlemen, please rest your sphincters.  Oh, my God!  This is the arresting police officer.  That's better.  Ah!  Ah! 
[01:05:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I have only one comment.  Shame!  Shame!  Shame!  Shame!  Shame on you!  Hey, bud!  Let's party!  No, no, that's okay.  Now we're going to do something extremely fun. 
[01:06:00]  No, let's not.  No?  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that's fun.  Yeah, sure.  Geez, for the cops.  They got a great story.  They want to make it sound like, you know, also, cops on the news are so fun.  They're so much different than cops in real life.  Because they're like, well, you know, I don't want to even discuss this.  And we're not going to talk about that.  But back at the station house.  Oh, my God.  Oh, they left.  Dude, we walked in.  And you never guess.  You never guess.  Holy, dude.  This guy. 
[01:06:30]  Sitting there watching porno.  Not even this guy.  This faggot.  Yeah.  How they talk.  We found a queer.  We found him with sex toys.  And let me tell you what he was doing.  Yeah.  You think they made the rookie carry the sex toys?  Oh, there you go, rookie.  Carry the evidence.  Yeah.  Put these in an evidence bag for us.  Yeah.  Could you hold this, and this, and this?  Give him three things so he's got to hold one in his mouth.  That's a stupid rookie.  Or hold it under his nose like a cigar.  Like a mustache.  Like a cigar. 
[01:07:00]  Wow.  Jimmy.  All right.  Way to improv.  Rebecca.  Coming through.  Really fast.  I like Bert's idea, so we're going to do a story of the month.  Yeah.  So, America has to beat this.  That's a good one.  That's got a lot of stuff in it.  And it's Allentown.  Is that close enough to Philly?  Not really.  We'll give it to Allentown.  I'm sure we're being heard in Allentown somewhere.  Yeah, I think we're on a station there.  Are we?  Okay.  So, Allentown.  Hi, Allentown. 
[01:07:30]  Of course we are.  See, if we're not, then it doesn't matter.  If we are, it makes it look like we know and we care.  Hi, Allentown.  Yeah, keep it local.  Good morning to you.  Keep it local.  78's got some traffic.  Weather in Allentown, it's going to be...  Rainy.  Rainy.  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  A little bit.  We're looking for the story of the month and this is the early leader from Allentown. 
[01:08:00]  All right.  I have a better story.  No, you can't.  It's Eric's birthday.  Happy birthday to you!  Happy birthday to you!  Happy birthday dear Eric!  Happy birthday to you! 
[01:08:30]  And your mom sent us fruit?  Yeah.  Subtle hint.  Sorry.  It was two pieces of melon with a banana between them.  Fruit for everybody.  Well, that's very, very nice there, Eric.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  How old are you?  Number?  29.  Oh, boy.  29.  Oh, he's going to be a joy to work with this year.  Pretty soon you're going to be older than me.  That's it.  You better start working it now when the press asks you.  Wow.  This is going to be a great year for us.  Midlife crisis.  29, but with that boy haircut. 
[01:09:00]  I give you about 17, 18.  You still got proofed, right?  Buying beer.  Oh, yeah.  Look at him.  At the 7-Eleven or something.  Well, not for age, but for gender.  mill.  Remember, total.  Oh, my God.  YouTube.  Oh, my God. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, I'm 42.  This is a monster night.  Oh, my God.  Storming the beaches like the gay area of Sandy Hook with a helmet.  Storming the beaches of Cherry Grove, Fire Island.  He's the only one running onto the beach backwards with his pants down.  Yeah, there's heavy shelling aimed right at him.  Put the hat back on.  There you go.  You're supposed to duck those things, not catch them. 
[01:10:00]  Storming the beaches of Norman.  All right.  So there you go.  There you go.  We got the story of the month so far.  You've got to beat the one you just heard.  Beat that.  Beat that.  Beat that.  And it could be in print or it could be audio, obviously.  And if you catch it on your local news, that would be a big help to the radio show if you sent it out.  Oh, of course it would.  More Wake Up Club audio before the break real fast.  Please.  Real fast, real fast, real fail.  Please.  All right.  This is what they're talking about right now. 
[01:10:30]  Softrock 106.5 WBMW.  It's Hold Me and Freewood back.  On the Wake Up Club with Glenn and Rebecca.  It's 6.41 on the button.  All right.  So allow a little extra time.  All right?  Wait a minute.  Did she just all right the time because it was on the button?  She just reacted to the time.  Oh.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Only three hours and 19 minutes to go.  Drink.  That was an all right for the time. 
[01:11:00]  Be one on the button.  All right.  So allow a little extra time.  Isn't that great being 6.41?  I don't know.  We got our finger on the pulse.  That's it.  That's the key here.  Yeah.  Now try to touch your nose with it.  Yes.  This is really funny if you were listening yesterday.  That's why we encourage you to linger longer.  Linger longer. 
[01:11:30]  Got our finger on the pulse.  That's it.  That's the key here.  That's the key, but don't give them to her.  That's no small accomplishment this week.  Yeah.  On the outside, we have 35 degrees.  Well, inside, it's about 80.  It's a little stuffy in this studio.  You think so?  Well, the window's open a little bit for you.  I think.  You're always cold, and I'm always stuffy.  I know.  We're like opposites in that respect.  That's it.  What, he's sober?  Don't say stuffy in the sense that you're like stuffy, stuffy.  You're hot.  You get warm.  I'm very stuffy.  I'm a very stuffed shirt kind of person. 
[01:12:00]  Wow.  Holy Jesus Christ.  This is the best radio I've ever heard.  I've got to quit the business.  Yeah.  There is no way I could ever do that.  It's fantastic.  I want to move to Connecticut just so I can get them live.  I don't want to wait 20 minutes.  How do we compete with that?  I think when we're done, I think I'm going to join one of these shows.  You got to.  Just as a goof.  How fantastic is that?  You can react to a time check. 
[01:12:30]  That would be on my radio every second that it's on.  I would have to listen to that.  It is so completely awful that it is a parody.  That cannot be a real radio show.  Do they ever break character and come out and say, look, we know this is crap we're doing.  This is drivel.  We've worked very hard to make this sound like the worst radio show in the country, and I think we've really accomplished this. 
[01:13:00]  That has never come up.  It's never come up in everything you've heard so far.  They've never broken character.  No, not at all.  Holy mackerel.  How funny would it be if we were fired and, like, next week they were on this station?  I wouldn't feel as bad.  It would be something to listen to.  By the way, backing up real fast, we got Eric from some website.  Why is it so in capital letters?  So.  Much funny that it's gay porn and gay is in capital letters.  He's very pissed off today.  Oh, because he's gay?  I guess. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, a little too close to the home.  It's funny because it's gay porn because we don't like gay porn.  And don't misinterpret.  It's not about making fun of gay people.  It's just simply about the fact that God doesn't love you.  Because gay porn makes it funny, man.  Of course.  Jesus.  Yeah, stop it.  If he was just watching porno, it's because every guy has done it.  Maybe not in his office after doing some crystal meth and selling it to your students. 
[01:14:00]  But the fact that the porn angle, you know, who hasn't sat in front of a porn movie and taken care of business?  This guy is sitting in front of porn when the cops burst in.  He's naked.  And just to make it that much worse, it's gay porn.  Gay porn.  Yeah.  Which just looks silly.  We've talked about it before.  It looks silly.  There's a small grain silo burning his colon.  Hey, uh...  Old periscope neck is a cackling jackass. 
[01:14:30]  That's Stephen from Maysburg.  Old periscope neck.  Yeah, we forgot the fact that Rebecca's neck is about three feet long.  Well, not in this picture we're looking at now.  Well, not now.  She seems to have bulked up.  She filled up to hide the neck, it looks like.  Hey, Sam's hold...  Sam's hold...  Got her slated for foie gras.  They're just force-feeding her with a funnel.  Sam's hold...  Fatty.  Sam's hold job this morning is to attempt to make the Wake Up Club more interesting and actually funny.  So he's taking the audio and trying to make it funny, right?  Yeah.  Good work, because that seems impossible. 
[01:15:00]  Well, we're going to listen to the same break, but with Sam's spin on it.  All right.  So, 106.5 WBMW, it's Hold Me and Fleetwood Mac on The Wake Up with Glenn and Rebecca.  It's 641 on the button.  All right.  So allow a little extra time.  Isn't that great, being 641?  I don't know.  We got our finger on the...  That's it.  That's the key here.  That's what it's all...  Yes.  That's no small...  Yeah.  Much funnier. 
[01:15:30]  Wow.  They are filthy.  They're potty-mouthed.  God, they are touching each other all over and putting fingers places.  Fantastic.  Sam, bring me more.  I cannot get enough.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I want to apologize to the audience if they don't find this entertaining, because I'm  just...  I'm addicted now.  Their breaks are too short.  Too short.  I want to hear more.  They should be doing a 71 share.  Is that even possible?  They're wonderful.  Fantastic. 
[01:16:00]  Hey, we got Tracy Morgan stopping by today, finally.  Tracy's coming by.  He's blown us off the last few times, but he's back.  So you're allowed to talk about things?  Hopefully.  We've been briefed on what not to talk about.  Nah.  The pending litigation.  I don't know.  He's cool.  We'll get into it with Tracy a little later.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  People are loving the Wake Up Club audio. 
[01:16:30]  More to come.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Lots of comments coming in on the instant feedback.  Hey, by the way, if people want to...  Because they do requests and stuff, I think.  Oh, yeah.  What's their website?  Anybody know?  Because they do have a website, this show.  Yeah.  WBMW.com, maybe?  WBMW.com?  Yeah, just go there.  Put their numbers on there, and they're the people that are...  Their company is suing the Opie and Anthony... 
[01:17:00]  Well, not suing, but...  Well, the company...  Aren't they suing...  They're suing the...  Petitioning?  I don't know.  Yeah, they're petitioning one of the radio companies.  To keep them from putting us on more stations.  They're trying to hurt us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, hey.  And look at how we react.  Nicely.  We drive people there to go, request a song or two.  That's right.  On the way driving them there, we hit a cab in a strip club.  Scott.  No, it's great.  Everyone can relate.  Because getting feedback from all over the country, people are saying, 
[01:17:30]  I have a show just like this in our city.  It's all the same drivel.  Yeah, every city.  And they call it local programming.  Yeah.  And that's what the radio industry is so up in arms about.  It's not enough local flavor in the business.  This is the local flavor.  Pooey.  Is it hot in here?  When you do that, it is.  I'm hot.  I'm stuffy.  I'm stuffy.  Someone tell Rod Stewart that that stupid crop close to the skull wig is awful. 
[01:18:00]  You think that's a wig at this point?  It has to.  He looks like Caligula with a mullet.  It's awful.  Is he still singing old standards?  Oh, he's atrocious.  Enough of that.  Really.  When he covered, we're having a party, I wanted to cut my own throat.  That could be the worst thing I've ever heard anybody sing.  We're having a party.  Horrid.  He's awful.  I have never thought he was good in any way, shape, or form.  What about wake up Maggie Mae?  Stop with the Maggie Mae.  Who cares about Maggie Mae?  Don't like the Maggie Mae? 
[01:18:30]  It's tolerable.  No.  Maggie Mae was a huge hit.  The second it's on, it's one of those songs, I cannot get to the radio fast enough and  get it off.  Do you think I'm Sexy I liked when I was growing up?  I swear to God, I thought I was cool listening to that.  If you want my body.  You need the Tippy Tom version.  This is better.  Now he can sing.  All right.  Well, our old pal is starting up his reality show on Sunday night.  Oh, boy.  Roll tape. 
[01:19:00]  The bridge burner is doing this.  Is that what it's called?  Bridge burner?  It might as well be.  He's burned more bridges than the Allied Army in World War II.  All right.  Very good.  Burned a lot of bridges.  Blew them up.  He's blown up a lot of bridges.  Seems like every World War II movie, they're blowing up a bridge, so I guess that's accurate.  What?  What happened?  Nothing.  Oh, okay.  I know that we're talking about dice. 
[01:19:30]  That's all.  Okay.  Well, the show's going to be on VH1.  You know, to be honest, I mean, we're not getting along with him at all, but it looks  like this show's going to be good.  Do you?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it's going to be a good show on VH1.  What have you seen that would lead you to believe this?  There's some samples on VH1, I believe.  Yeah.  The website.  Although he's on a train or something, and Kenny goes, he would never be on a train in  real life. 
[01:20:00]  Everything we talk about just pops up on the news.  Oh, wow.  There you go.  And we start talking about it, and then I get all distracted because I'm seeing clips  of them.  They just showed a picture of them from like, or a clip from 1980-something.  80-something.  And then there he is.  He's on TV right now.  There he is.  He's wearing them big old man glasses.  With the very...  The ones where you got the Cadillacs in your eyes.  Wow.  He's really dying the hair these days.  Holy crap.  Yeah.  But he's not dying the... 
[01:20:30]  He's not dying his sideburns.  He's not dying the Elvis sideburns.  Something else is going on.  And he's got...  Oh, my God.  There's something going on.  I can't tell.  And he's got paint in his hair to make it look like he has more hair.  But look at the left side of his head.  There's a big part or something.  It looks like he had some kind of brain surgery.  Oh, Jesus.  There he is.  There's the bridge burner with his gray Elvis sideburns.  And my leather jacket.  And then the leather jacket dies. 
[01:21:00]  Wow.  Oh, we got to get some of this audio.  Yeah, I'm sure he's just cracking everybody.  Yeah, I want to hear what kind of hilarity he's spewing out here.  Well, the Dice Man cometh again.  Andrew Dice Clay, the 80s comic who once achieved rock star status,  has since fallen on hard times and hopes a new VH1 reality show about his life  will help him reclaim his throne.  Ultimately, he's shooting for a mega-sized comedy concert  at Giant Stadium by this summer. 
[01:21:30]  He's delusional.  Completely delusional.  When we were on top of our game and we had Dice on our show on a regular basis,  we helped him get pretty close to a sellout at Madison Square Garden back in 2002.  And that was with a lot of work.  A lot of work.  Pushing.  Every day he would call us.  Hey, can I get on and talk about the show?  How the hell is he going to get a concert at Giant Stadium? 
[01:22:00]  A mega concert at Giant Stadium.  Why would I want to watch Dice shaving?  I don't know.  They're showing clips from the show.  Anyway, I really don't see any reason why I can't pull it off.  Clay told the Post yesterday,  my professional aim is to come out of retirement, he says,  although I never really retired.  When the new show begins,  he is lucky to fill a comedy club in New Brunswick, New Jersey. 
[01:22:30]  I think it's funny, by the way, for Vinny.  Haha, stupid.  They didn't mention the name of the Stress Factory on the paper.  Oh, is the Stress Factory?  Yeah, I just think it's hilarious.  A club in New Brunswick.  It would have been so much faster to write Stress Factory.  You don't have to have Vinny Primer.  Pardon? Pardon?  Why did they write that?  And the Stress Factory, it's a great club.  Great club.  Vinny runs a great club down there in New Brunswick.  And his agent tells him his dream of selling out Giants Stadium is pure fantasy.  Of course it is.  And then Dice turned around and fired his manager for saying that. 
[01:23:00]  For saying that?  For giving him a taste of reality.  Although the scenes in Dice Undisputed start about six months ago  when Clay was in the early stages of his attempt at a comeback,  his roots go back about six years when he began filming himself daily as a form of therapy.  The show will occasionally dip into Dice's personal stash of tapes for flashbacks.  Yeah.  And this is where it gets interesting.  He says he started giving the growing library of tapes different names like  Dice Divorced and Dice World.  Dice Divorced and Dice World. 
[01:23:30]  That's just me with a camera.  But there's other ones.  There's other tapes?  Of course, I got thousands of them.  Thousands of them.  There's Dice with Mice.  What's Dice with Mice?  I went to Disney.  And it's me, Mickey, Minnie, Dice with Mice.  And we go on a ride with my kids and have a good time.  Space Mountain, the teacup ride.  Well, the teacups, they get me dizzy and I vomit. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  So I can't go on that.  But Dice with Mice.  What else is in the collection there?  Well, I do a cooking segment called Slice and Dice.  That's where I take vegetables and I don't just slice them.  I dice them.  Oh!  That sounds wonderful.  There's a, we go to a sushi place.  Okay.  And we have sushi.  What could that take?  Care to guess? 
[01:24:30]  Uh, Dice.  With Rice!  That's right, of course.  Dice with Rice!  Of course, because you've got to label all your tapes in your library.  You just want to be able to take these tapes out at an instant notice there, right?  I go undercover in one of my older tapes.  Okay.  And I hunt down prostitutes.  Um...  Vice Dice!  Oh, yeah, of course.  Vice Dice!  Vice Dice!  Eee! 
[01:25:00]  Oh, why are you arresting me?  Because you're a whore!  Vice Dice!  Vice Dice, Dice!  Vice Dice!  Vice Dice!  Do you do, like, David Caruso lines as Vice Dice?  Oh!  Hey, uh, Frank!  She's a whore!  Oh!  No, with that...  I don't need the who.  No, you do, though.  I go, oh!  No, no.  Unbelievable!  No, if you're gonna...  I used the clip from Unbelievable.  I understand that, but if you're gonna do the David Caruso, you need the who thing at the end,  so then people know you're doing David Caruso. 
[01:25:30]  Oh, Christ, now I gotta get the template.  You're making me work.  All right.  Uh, uh, Dice Vice.  Dice Vice.  Vice Dice, whatever.  All right, David Caruso.  Here you go.  Focus.  Focus.  Hey, uh, Frank!  She's a whore!  That was awful, Dice.  You wanna hear awful?  Yeah. 
[01:26:00]  I was, uh, in a club once.  Okay.  And, uh, performing.  And the whole place started on fire and killed a bunch of people.  Oh, that's...  But I taped it.  You taped it, I guess...  It's called One Spitting Dice Shy.  Eeeh!  My, my, my.  One Spitting Dice Shy, baby.  I think you're reaching with the naming of your tapes over there.  No, this is how they're named.  Yeah?  It's over years.  You got another one?  See, I got a collection. 
[01:26:30]  Years worth of material.  I like the other one, uh, the top one there.  Oh, that's my skating.  Yeah, you're skating.  Dice on ice.  Dice on ice, of course.  Dice on ice.  There he goes.  A triple sow cow.  You can't do a triple sow cow.  I don't do one.  I'm looking at her.  Look at her.  She's a cow to hoo her.  I just skate, fall down, and insult people.  Yeah.  Dice on ice.  And then I do one where it's just me. 
[01:27:00]  See, it's a collection of tapes.  I do somersaults all day long.  All day long.  All day long.  All day long.  All day long.  All day long.  Somersaults.  Over and over, over and over, all day long.  And I'm in Vegas.  Yeah.  And I'm just doing somersaults down the strip.  Why does it have to be in Vegas?  Well, it's because of the name.  All right, what's the name of the tape?  Figure it out.  Somersaults, Vegas.  Roll the dice.  Oh, of course, roll the dice. 
[01:27:30]  Roll the dice.  You're a smart one.  And then there's a, I'm tearing up.  Yeah, why, why?  I'm putting myself out there.  All right, what's going on?  It's the sensitive dice.  The sensitive dice.  Say, sometimes I was sensitive.  Yeah.  And I videotaped it.  And if you look at the label on this videocassette, it's called Once Dice Three Times a Lady. 
[01:28:00]  It's also titled the same thing on the one where I cross-dress.  Once Dice Three Times a Lady.  Hey, let's go to the phones.  You're missing a couple names here.  Oh, I bet I'm not.  Yeah, we...  Uh, Lee, what's up?  Hey, you're killing me out here.  Dice has one video with a shower cam.  He calls it Fuzzy Dice.  Well, because it's true, you're disguised familiar with my works. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  It's filmed through that glass.  Yeah.  That you see in the shower.  Sure.  And I'm washing myself, my, my yambag, and I call it Fuzzy Dice.  Because the camera's outside, and I'm fuzzy.  Let's go to Sean and Phil.  I also do a little game show.  Oh, you do game show?  Yeah, it was like 93, 94, I did a game show called The Price is Dice. 
[01:29:00]  And then Wheel of Dice.  Wheel of Dice.  So you think you got dice.  Yeah.  And then, uh, are you smarter than dice?  And then, of course, my favorite.  It's a big hit.  Yeah.  Let me deliver the line like I did on the show.  All right, get ready.  Wait.  Drag of the cigarette.  There you go.  Don't forget.  All right, this is a game show?  Another game show tape?  Another game show.  All right, we're ready.  Okay, you ready?  Here's how I did it. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  Dice.  Or no dice.  We say the, which way?  Bosco or you bet?  You bet.  I'm a dick.  We say no dice at this point.  Oh, so does everybody.  Yeah, no, I mean, no, yeah.  Yeah.  Sean and Philly, what's up?  Hey, guys, remember the footage from your vacation in South Florida?  Yeah.  Oh, you're talking about Miami Dice.  Yeah, that's one of my favorites. 
[01:30:00]  I cruised around in a car real fast with neon clothes on.  And the dice was, and Don Bedazzled on my back.  It was painted in pastels.  And I wore no socks.  Well, let's say hi to Jim in Jersey.  Jim?  And I hang around with a colored guy.  And we solved crime.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, don't forget when I took Dice to go get his hair colored.  Oh, right, right, right. 
[01:30:30]  We brought the camera that day.  And they found something.  And that's on a videotape called Dice with Lice.  Here we go.  And you picked them out like a chimpanzee.  A chimpanzee.  A chimpanzee.  A chimpanzee.  Let's go to Mike in Hoboken.  Yeah.  How about that religious movie with Mel Gibson?  Oh, The Passion of the Dice?  There you go.  There you go.  Yeah.  I'm trying to carry a cross, and they're beating me senseless. 
[01:31:00]  I thought that was your sex tape.  Passion of the Dice?  Yeah, I thought that was your sex tape.  Yeah, that could be the sex tape, too.  I was thinking more, beat me while I carry a cross.  Okay.  All right.  Let's say hi to Mike in Queens.  Mike, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Dice has smoked at Westbury Music Fair this summer.  There's no way he's throwing out Giant Stadium.  Hey, you're going to piss off Dice.  Hey, hey.  He believes that he can do it.  I'm going to pack Giant Stadium.  It's a guarantee.  Okay?  Dice, don't forget about your duet with Vanilla Ice. 
[01:31:30]  Oh.  Dice, Dice.  That would be Dice, Dice, baby.  Dice was playing poker last night.  He's a little slow.  Let's go to Jeff and Jersey.  No, I was thinking of the two colored guys.  Where one's dead.  What?  The two colored guys that lip synced.  Oh, yeah.  Billy Manoli.  Yeah, yeah.  I got confused.  And I couldn't figure out how Dice fit into that. 
[01:32:00]  Okay.  It doesn't fit.  Let's go to Jeff and Jersey.  Jeff.  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Jeff.  I heard that he was touring with a boy band.  Anybody know what it's called?  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  I got videos.  It's Spice Dice.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  We're good.  We would do Spice Dice.  Spice Dice.  Of course.  Love you guys.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Well, there you go.  The, uh...  Well, hold on.  Another one coming in.  Jason in Jersey.  Jason.  Jason. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  I want to remind you that skating movie was in with Robbie Benson in the 80s, you know?  Oh, one of my favorites.  I got plenty of tape.  You're going to see it on my show.  It was a sensitive...  Wait a minute.  I'm tearing up.  Oh, boy.  This was a sensitive movie.  You all right?  It was Dice Castles.  Remember the movie Dice Castles?  Where I'm skating.  I believe the bitch was blind.  Or something.  Wasn't she?  Where's IMDb when you need it? 
[01:33:00]  Well, I'll look it up for you.  It was a long time ago.  And then there's, uh...  I did a cute, uh...  I kind of kicked it old school.  Yeah.  When the variety shows were in.  Yeah.  I did one called Variety.  It's the Dice of Life.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Don't you do a, uh...  Like a Dr. Phil type of thing?  You got a tape of you, like, giving, uh...  Oh, Dice Advice.  There you go.  Yeah.  Uh...  Kick her out of the bed when you're done. 
[01:33:30]  And don't sleep in the wet spot.  Egees.  Egees.  Let's go to Chris in Rhode Island.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, I heard you're going to be in your own Grand Theft Auto game.

Larry!  Larry!  Dice, remember that pornographic movie you were in? 
[01:34:00]  Long time Dice you were in?  Oh, it was the, uh, the gay porno I did.  Yeah.  It was called Of Dice and Men.  It was all gay porno.  There's one part where he's petting something, but it ain't a bunny rabbit.  I'll tell you that.  Ugly!  Let's say hi to, uh, we were ready to move on, but they're reminding you. 
[01:34:30]  Move on!  People love Dice!  No, they're reminding you of other tapes you have in your collection here.  It's, uh, Jeff in West Virginia.  Jeff.  Yeah, the, uh, the show where Dice infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan?  White Dice?  White Dice?  I think Jeff ended the bit.  Well, maybe not.  Let's say hi to Corey in Philly, listening on WYSP.  Corey!  Hey, what's up, Dice?  Remember you did the show on ice with a pair of ice skates? 
[01:35:00]  Oh, that was another skating thing, not, uh, Dice Castles.  That was when I was touring with the Dice Capades.  That's right.  I'd come out dressed like Snoopy, and I'd skate, then I'd take off the Snoopy suit and  go, look, it's Dice here, you're watching the Dice Capades, over here, I'm over here  now, and then I'd skate a little, and go, no, I'm over here now, on skates.  On skates.  The Dice Capades, plot a dice on ice.  Yeah. 
[01:35:30]  Dice versus a hundred, and Saturday Night Dice.  Saturday Night Dice.  There's so many here coming in.  You're happy?  You're happy?  Now you're a has-been.  That's part of Saturday Dice fever.  And there's a real stretch with the movie Titanic.  Oh, where the ship hit the dice back?  Yeah, well, yeah.  Yeah.  It's a big, destructive mass that just sits there and gets fatter as the years go by. 
[01:36:00]  Let's say hi to Jamie in Buffalo.  Jamie, listening on the edge.  What's up, Jamie?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  How about when you were with Cheech and Chung?

You take the good, you take the bad, you take it all in there, you got the facts of Dice.  The facts of Dice.  There's a fat broad black chick, the one that you wanted to bang before she got fat.  The facts of Dice. 
[01:40:30]  All right.  I think we're finally done.  Swoogie, are we done?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Dice, I remember during your sensitive period, you formed this band just so you could  sing songs to empower women.  Oh, the Dice Girls.  Yeah.  Yeah, I fronted the Dice Girls.

If the Giants make the Super Bowl.  Okay.  And I go in there.  Yeah.  It's full.  If I just stand up in a seat and start doing my act, I'm playing to a packed Giants.  What?  If the Giants are in the Super Bowl.  Oh, perhaps they don't play at Giant Stadium.  No, no, no.  If they put a dome on it. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  It might be in the running.  Yeah.  Well, you're going to play the Garden, though.  Again, that's good.  The Olive Garden.  Exactly.  Right there in Times Square.  You get all the breadsticks you want.  Oh, boy.  Let's say hi to Ed in Westchester.  Ed, are we done or are we?  Ed.  I think you forgot when Dice was on American Idol a couple of seasons ago.  Dice, were you on American Idol?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't remember me?  No, I don't.  I was Bo Dice.  I sang songs. 
[01:42:00]  What kind of songs?  I was the rocker.  I think you were singing Elvis or something, no?  Bo Dice.  All right.  Enough.  Three blind dice.  All right.  Three blind dice.  What?  Did we run this into the ground?  Oh.  Aren't you part of a legendary, you know, rap act?  Oh, the rap act N.W.A.?  Yeah.  Of course.  Who are you in that? 
[01:42:30]  Dice Cube.  What are you, stupid?  You can't figure these out yet?  See, everything's dice.  Everything's dice.  Dice.  Well, he's naming his tapes, so there you go.  There you go.  Got a lot of tapes.  Yeah, he sure does.  Want to go to a break with Dice Dice Baby?  Yeah, we love this thing.  Is Tracy Morgan here?  Oh, boy. 
[01:43:00]  It was on Saturday Night Dice.  Doesn't even rhyme.  Who cares?  Jack is.  Let's save this bit by playing this as we go to break before we really slam, hammer this  into the ground.  And it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Big.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Dice checking in from over here.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Oh, it's so nice.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Oh.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Nice, be nice. 
[01:43:30]  Dice, Dice, baby.  I'm over here now.  Dice, Dice, baby.  Gotta love the Dice.  Dice, Dice, baby.  I'm over here now.  Dice, Dice.  Dice, Dice, Dice.  Dice, Dice, Dice.  If I got to have that. 
[01:44:00]  I got your legs.  Okay, terrific.  Don't just stare at it, eat it.  Just look at me like a chick with balls.  He's a jack-o-fix point to see.  He's a scumbag.  Nice, see, nice.  I'm over here.  Yeah, nice, see, nice.  I'm good like that, my friend. 
[01:44:30]  Get full of crap.  Look what we did to you again.  Are we looking at a picture of a dead Anna Nicole Smith?  No, it's just the funeral, I guess.  The funeral procession is just starting up.  We can't explain all of them, kids.  This is the Opie and Anthony show, the O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Silly.  Uh, our phone number.  Really don't need to give it out as much.  It's kind of nice.  Well, give it out. 
[01:45:00]  All right, 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  We have more Wake Up Club audio.  At this point, we just can't explain it anymore.  It's just an awful, boring show.  It's one of these, you got them in every town crap shows on this company that is giving us some problems.  Oh, you're explaining.  That's a, that's such a quick explanation.  I was going to say they're a crap show that is on our radar, which is a bad thing.  Don't be on our radar. 
[01:45:30]  You don't want to be on our radar.  So as we were doing the dice bit, where Anthony was doing the dice bit.  We were all having fun.  I was helping.  They were, uh, I played the straight man.  And I helped.  And Jimmy helped.  I sat there with a blank mind wondering, how do you think this fast?  It really was.  I felt like a Down Syndrome person chatting with Stephen Hawking.  A Down Syndrome person.  Way to phrase it.  Jackass.  That's why you're going to be at Bananas.  You're just terrific.  Everyone knows. 
[01:46:00]  Tonight, tomorrow.  Everyone knows you're just terrific.  Bananas.  Pool keeps.  Pool keeps.  Joe Curry told me he's going to be doing the show with you.  Yes, your friend Foot will be doing the show.  He's very excited.  I'm happy, too.  He's a funny comic.  Joe loves Jimmy.  Foreigner Colder's Dice is coming in.  Pat Benatar.  Fire and Dice.  Fire and Dice.  It continues.  But here is what the Wake Up Club was doing as we were doing that break.  All right.  Soft Rock 106.5 WBMW.  There's John Mayer waiting on the world to change.  It's 7.43 on the Wake Up Club with Glenn and Rebecca. 
[01:46:30]  I love the lyrics to that song.  Yeah.  When they own the information, they can bend it all they want.  Sounds familiar, right?  It says a lot.  I was thinking deeply about that.  Oh.  So get me off that tangent.  I do like John Mayer, though.  Yeah.  It's 37 degrees outside.  It's time for tripping.  Are they?  She just laughed at when they own the information.  Are they alluding to things?  Do they know we're, like, ragging them?  Like, are they alluding to the fact that we're ragging on them? 
[01:47:00]  No.  Why?  I don't know.  Because a couple of their breaks just seem like they're kind of annoyed.  They're too happy a show to be annoyed and, like, be into that lyric.  Like, he said that lyric like it meant something to them.  We got into their heads.  That's all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I love the lyrics to that song.  It's like, you're 57 and fat.  That's something you say when you're 17.  No.  Yeah.  You tell your friend when you're smoking pot.  She's 34.  No, not her, the guy. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, the guy's 57?  No, I'm just saying he looks fat.  Oh, Carol O'Connor-ish.  Fred Mertz.  It's a William Frawley looking.  Yeah, it's 37 degrees outside.  It's time for trivia.  That's right.  Lorraine Newman.  Oh, trivia?  She's the original SNL cast member.  She's got a birthday today.  And she played one of the Coneheads in a recurring skit about aliens.  Called the Coneheads.  Who claimed to come from which country?  That's the question.  Which country did they come from?  France.  Like, 200 of them. 
[01:48:00]  France.  France, call me.  Let me call.  No, you can't call.  You're doing your own radio show.  Damn it.  Coneheadextend?  That's it.  Wait, Tracy's on another station right now?  Is he supposed to be here?  Holy Jesus.  Wait a minute.  Oh, if we have to beat him in.  Yeah, he's on 105.1 in New York.  Right now?  He was right.  Like, they just went to commercial.  He was right there.  He was talking about his kids with birth control. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, wow.  All right.  Well, I guess we got to fill.  We were expecting to talk to Tracy Morgan right now.  Well, I got it.  I found him for you.  Oh, by the way, Joe, thanks for listening to 105.1.  We appreciate the support.  Yeah, what are you doing?  I listen to you guys every day.  Nothing helps our self-esteem more than a caller calling in to tell us that the guest  for your show is on the station I'm listening to instead of you.  No, no.  I listen to you guys.  I'm listening to repeats all through the night, everything.  All right.  It's just that. 
[01:49:00]  I was flipping through the channels when you guys went to commercial.  All right.  Okay, Joe.  All right.  We'll give you a pass.  There's some fine advertisers on this show.  I would suggest enjoying the commercials as we do.  I love Dunkin' Donuts.  What?  I had two munchkins.  I put one at each cheek and I went, like a little chipmunk.  Yeah, just doing impressions.  Yeah.  You did a Marlon Brando with the munchkins.  It was very, very nice for everybody.  Yes, and then I just petered out on it. 
[01:49:30]  I knew exactly where you were going.  I got nothing.  I got nothing.  What flavor is that?  Marble Frosted.  Die.  Wow.  Marble Frosted.  What?  Marble Frosted.  Kev, you can't taste things, right?  Kev, is that his mind?  You really are out of your mind.  Kev is a psychopath.  You can't smell stuff, right?  That's a fact.  What?  You can taste this and it's delicious.  Is it good?  So you can taste a donut, but you can't smell a donut.  Generally, it just tastes sweet.  Big Kev, one of our guys, he doesn't smell. 
[01:50:00]  He just doesn't.  He has no sense of smell.  He has no sense of smell, but he understands what a donut's all about.  Donut good.  It's about delicious and sweet.  All right.  There you go.  Anyway, we're making the Wake Up Club funny.  That break you just heard.  Sam, his whole job this morning is to try to make these guys interesting and funny.  Make them funny.  Sounds like an impossible job.  But Sam pulls it off.  Here you go.  Same break.  A little differently.  Soft Rock, 106.5, WB...  Oh, man.  Wrong track.  Sorry.  Oh, no. 
[01:50:30]  Soft F***, 106.5, WB and...  I love that it's just soft boop.  You know what it's supposed to mean when it's bleeped.  Rhymes with.  All right.  All right.  Soft F***, 106.5, WB and...  Would you listen to a station called Soft Blank?  Uh, no.  I'd relate to it if it was over in two trampoline jumps.  Mr. Trampoline Man. 
[01:51:00]  Mr. Trampoline Man.  Yeah, you got to do it to me, man.  Nah, that's actually...  All right.  I felt good, too.  Yeah, but that's more my bombing is just spreading like some kind of a sickness.  I'm coughing and bombs are spreading.  Sam?  You're not going to be bombing in Poughkeepsie tonight?  Oh, no.  I hope not.  Tickets go in like hotcakes, they tell me.  Sam eating a donut.  How sweet.  By the way...  There's a Rockwell painting.  You can see it going down his chest and into his stomach.  Yeah.  A little svelte body that it has.  Like a baby bird. 
[01:51:30]  Like a snake eating a big rat.  Yeah.  Nutter Butter Twink.  By the way, you're listening to Filler.  This is Filler.  This is Filler.  Welcome to the Filler Show.  We were supposed to talk to Tracy Morgan right now.  But he's booked on the other show.  Huh?  And now he's got to go on another show?  Oh, that's the show he was on.  All right.  Oh, okay.  He'll be here.  I'm sure he's running over to do a couple minutes for us.  All right.  Yeah, here's what Sam did with that audio to make it interesting.  Soft Filler 106.5 WBMW. 
[01:52:00]  There's John Mayer waiting on the world to change.  It's 743 on the Wake Up Club with Glenn and Rebecca.  I love the lyrics to that song.  Yeah.  When they own the ****, they can bend it all they want.  Sounds familiar, right?  It says a lot.  I was thinking deeply about ****.  Oh.  So get me off ****.  I do like ****, though.  Yeah.  It's time for ****.  That's right.  Oh, are they filthy.  What a filthy show.  Someone report them to the FCC. 
[01:52:30]  Good job today, Sam.  Yes.  We're going to see John Mayer later today at XM Jazz.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, performance.  A little artist confidential.  I'll be there.  Now, this is not going to be like one of those things where you're brushed aside, either.  What do you mean?  Because you know the guy.  No, no.  We weren't brushed aside when we saw Sting the same way.  You were brushed aside.  We met him.  He just got mad because my picture didn't come out and I needed a second one.  Brushed aside.  He almost killed me for that.  And there's going to be no loot involved today.  No, not at all. 
[01:53:00]  Thank God.  He should come out with a loot just to screw the audience over.  Here.  I don't even know how to play it.  Pling, plang, plang, plang.  Thank you.  And then sing it like, who is that fool Sting was singing?  What is his awful, uh...  Why am I asking you guys?  Like, you'll recall that immediately with a guy from the 15th century.  Oh, yeah.  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh.  John something?  Uh, uh, the songs of...  Deuteronomy.  Crap.  We heard his name so many times. 
[01:53:30]  Uh, John, uh, uh, whatever.  There's no way you know it.  Yeah, because as soon as we say the name, people are going to be like, uh...  Who?  Oh.  I don't care.  I know that guy.  No, no one knows this guy.  Eric's trying to open it.  Uh...  Uh...  What, a jar of mayo?  With his...  That's all he wants for birthday.  Is he got, like, a, a, a shirt box just filled with mayonnaise and he just scrapes his  fingers into it on the bottom of the cardboard and licks it off his fingers.  That's what Hawk does.  We're continuing with filler.  Nothing says good radio than leaning into a computer screen and going, uh... 
[01:54:00]  Uh...  I don't think it's fine.  I think it's fine with just chit-chat a little bit.  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with us chit-chatting.  Oh, look at Eric running.  Wow.  You can relax for a few days.  I'm not playing the loot.  We could do a little better than playing the loot.  No, I'm not playing the loot.  All right.  Is loot audio?  Yeah, he ran over with, uh, loot audio.  Oh, I hope you have cancer before you're 30.  Jesus.  He's 29 today. 
[01:54:30]  I know.  And next year you'll have a great joke when they say, how old do you just go, 29 again?  Then sit back and let the laughter ensue.  Hey, why are you doing your opening joke?  Oh, I did blow it.  Hey, buddy, it's my birthday, 29 again.  I'll actually pause and give a little wink and the crowd'll ask, go, you get out of here.  I get it.  That's nutty.  He's unbelievable.  He's over 30.  Office humor.  The type of thing your broad says.  And I told her, file it.  Ah, did you?  How'd he get any work done?  All right, let's scrub the toilet and be seen and not heard. 
[01:55:00]  Dope.  Want to go backwards a little bit?  You said you wanted the audio from Dice on the local news station.  Yeah, I saw them popping up there, so I figured I had something really interesting.  Well, this is the delusional Dice.  His show starts on VH1 on Sunday, and it looks like it's going to be worth watching.  We'll take a look at it.  We'll take a peek.  Me and Florentine were actually touring with him when he started filming. 
[01:55:30]  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That long ago.  Yeah, about six years ago.  Yeah.  Andrew Dice Clay is back and ready to take the comedy world by storm.  And, of course, we are so happy to have you here with us.  Welcome, the Dice Man, everyone.  It's fun to be here.  Tell me about the long hiatus.  What have you been up to?  Well, you know, yeah, I took a take-off.  I worked, you know.  I called this whole thing about coming out of retirement.  Because a lot of people went through a great marriage.  And everyone around me. 
[01:56:00]  And what happened was, as far as the show goes, I started filming myself as sort of a  way, you know, like to self-analyze myself.  And, you know, I started filming my kids and my girlfriend and other comics.  And when I took these tapes to Fox, to Fox Television, they said, you've been filming  a show that nobody asked for.  For how many years?  My goodness.  But, you know, I'm very honest about it.  Thank goodness.  I wanted to film like a real type of reality show that really shows, you know, what I was  going through, where I've been. 
[01:56:30]  And, you know, this whole coming out of retirement thing.  Who is this guy?  He don't sound like me no more.  He's the serious dice.  That's serious dice.  Where he just sits and talks.  John Dowlin.  Thank you, Iraq.  He's not yelling.  I just tape my stuff and make a show there.  The serious slash delusional dice.  Yeah, he's not yelling at her, calling her a whole world.  If anybody knows about what fame does is myself.  I mean, I was doing 20,000 seats a night. 
[01:57:00]  Oh, right already.  You know, like a lightning rod for the media.  And a lot of people have been asking me, what's this thing about Giant Stadium?  That's coming up next, right?  You sold out the garden in 1990.  I sold the garden out for two nights.  And I actually came back in 2000, sold it out again.  And who did that for you, prick?  We did.  Who did that for you, prick?  You bridge-burning ass.  I did it again in 2000. 
[01:57:30]  He would not have pulled that off without us.  We worked around the clock to help him out.  Yeah.  And in all fairness, he was giving us great radio back in the day.  We had a great relationship.  It was fun.  And we were doing some great radio with dice, and we pushed hard.  It was Opie and Anthony present dice.  There was actual billboards and advertising that says Opie and Anthony presents dice at the garden.  So we were pushing the hell out of that show.  But the things he's done for this show, I mean, the things he's brought to this show.  Well, introduced us to Jimmy Norton.  I must say, little Jimmy Norton was left on our doorstep by dice. 
[01:58:00]  That's true.  And Club Soda Ken is now.  And Club Soda Kenny.  He blew off part of the posse.  Kenny doesn't want any part of this, but he blew off Kenny after 18 years.  And to this day, Kenny has no idea why Dice just blew him off out of nowhere.  He blew us off.  Whatever.  He's a bridge burner.  Because he's silly.  Nice.  And I actually came back in 2000, sold it out again, you know, just to show my kids.  But Giant Stadium, to me, is a statement not just of self-accomplishment and showing my 
[01:58:30]  children by example, but it's also, I always talk to them about, if you see, I'm wearing  the lion.  Yeah, I see.  You know, and it's not because I'm a Leo, it's because the lion's the king of the jungle.  And why?  Because, you know, when the lion's backed against the wall, his claws come out.  It's not that he's the biggest.  That's when you shoot him.  He knows how to fight for himself.  He also sleeps a lot, the lion.  Yeah.  Lions sleep like 23 hours a day.  And that might be the problem, guys.  I'm very sleepy.  We do know he likes to sleep a lot. 
[01:59:00]  You're lions.  You ever see the Lion King?  It's wonderful.  I cried, me, my kids, we all cried.  I teach by example.  So now my kids are spray-painting their heads.  All right, we're really late, and Tracy's here, but this last clip before we go to break.  I want to do Giant Stadium because I don't get too political with things, but when...  Never going to happen.  ...9-11 happened, and they did a really big show at the Garden, you know, and, you know,  I really wanted to be part of it, but because I didn't have the heat at the time, you know, 
[01:59:30]  the producers wouldn't allow it, and I'm going, I'm the only guy ever.  I'm from Brooklyn, New York, and I take a lot of pride in that, and I love New York, and  I feel, you know, I am a big part of New York, so I want to come back and do this.  It's the biggest event ever in the history of stand-up.  A big part of New York.  What?  A hundred thousand people to Giant Stadium and...  And you definitely will.  Oh my God, the dumb news broad said you definitely will?  There it is. 
[02:00:00]  I guarantee this isn't happening.  Unless they section off maybe like section 182.  They're going to do something where, yeah, they section it off, block it off with curtains  or mirrors.  Right.  They'll just use like mirrors in front and mirrors in back so it looks like it goes on forever.  He's going to team up with David Blaine to make it look like a full stadium.  David Copperfield, another has-been.  It's going to be David Copperfield, Dice, and just in case, maybe Dane Cook waiting in 
[02:00:30]  the wings to really sell out the place for him.  The end of the show, the magician comes and makes the audience disappear because they just  disappear.  Then he gets on stage to an empty cry and goes, wait, this was supposed to happen after  the show.  And what I'm going to do is put signs up that say, coming to Giant Stadium, Comic DC.  So they think it's Dane Cook, but it's actually Dice Clay.  And then when the place packs out, I come out.  And they go, who's this?  You're going to perform in front of cardboard cutouts. 
[02:01:00]  Should I perform a sensitive interview, Dice?  Or should I, should I do this?  Or should I do this?  I think you do that.  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  You want people to feel sorry for you so they start watching the show.  So you got to be a little sensitive.  A little serious.  I'm humble.  Goosh, goosh.  You're a whore.  Get out of the bed.  I'm done with you.  And you're going to be at Giant Stadium.  Giant Stadium.  Actually, I'm just going to be at a giant stadium. 
[02:01:30]  It's going to be empty.  Me standing in the middle of a giant stadium.  I like sensitive Dice.  You know how he could fill up Giant Stadium?  He just invites everybody that he turned his back on.  And that place would be packed.  Oh, wow.  That place would be packed.  They were turning people away.  Oh, my God.  I can't stand this son of a bitch.  I have to get in.  That's the only way he's going to fill Giant Stadium.  A big body.  A big prick.  Oh, that's great. 
[02:02:00]  Go F yourself.  We got Tracy Morgan to wrap up this side of the show.  Nice.  And we're going to do that next.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Very happy to see Tracy Morgan.  It's been a while.  My brother's from another mother with a different color.  You know how we do rock and roll.  He made it in.  We did karaoke in L.A.  What, two, three days ago?  Who was there? 
[02:02:30]  Karaoke?  You did karaoke?  Three days ago.  Who was that there sang?  The rock and roll guy that made that song.  Oh, the lead singer Survivor was there.  Get out of here.  And he did his song.  Yeah?  Eye of the Tiger?  No, did he do Eye of the Tiger?  He did a couple of jams.  That's the big one.  That was my high school football song, man.  Yeah, that's the big song.  Before we went around and got beat.  The Rocky song.  Hey, can we curse on this station?  Not on this one.  Not this one?  We're about 15 minutes from cursing. 
[02:03:00]  You know we rock and roll, dude.  I got some stories to tell you, baby.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Potty mouth.  Good stuff.  You know that, man.  I'm the spice of life.  I forget politics.  I like to talk about sex.  I have a sex life.  I still have one.  I got to take pills to get it up, but it's good.  Jimmy was having a problem the other day.  Hey, we're older now.  We're not younger.  We're not...  Jimmy can only jump up and down on a trampoline, what, twice, Jimmy?  Twice.  Twice.  It's the worst performance.  It was like one and a half push-ups that collapsed in tapioca pudding. 
[02:03:30]  It was the horrible thing you've ever seen in your life.  Yeah, look, Chase is like, my brother.  You're happy with that.  The best part was the reaction of your girlfriend, where it was just like...  No, it's all right.  It's all right.  It is what it is.  What pills?  Viagra?  Yes.  Whatever is available.  Whatever the homeboy got.  You know?  Whatever.  I'll buy him off the street.  I was going to say, whatever he's got on the corner.  I'll get it off the street.  I'll try it.  I'll get it off the street.  You know?  I'll get it off the street.  I'll try it. 
[02:04:00]  Whatever.  Tracy...  It don't matter.  It don't work unless she's into you anyway.  Most chicks ain't into me.  They're not into me.  My wife ain't been into me for a while.  I'm talking about into me, man.  You know?  A woman's got to be into you, man.  And look at me, man.  Women ain't into me.  They like me because I make them laugh, but...  You're a big star and all that.  It goes a long way.  And you're a funny guy.  I'm not a hunk.  Women love a sense of humor, Tracy.  I'm not LL.  LL.  Yeah, but, you know, the sense of humor goes a long way. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, but I'm not eye candy.  I'm not candy.  I'm not candy.  I think I am, but I'm not candy.  I ain't no cutie.  You're smooth.  No, I'm older.  I'm almost 40, man.  So is our own Iraq.  Yeah.  It's my birthday today.  My birthday today is 39.  I'm good.  I'm a lover.  I'm a lover.  I got experience.  You're not knowing how to romance.  You're almost 40?  Yeah.  See you goddamn black guys, man.  Jesus Christ.  Black don't crack.  That's what they say.  Black don't frown. 
[02:05:00]  Goddamn.  Brown don't frown.  Eddie Murphy.  What is he, 65 now?  I'm not that way.  And Eddie looks great.  He looks younger now.  Goddamn, Eddie looks like he just walked off the set of 48 Hours.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  That's from all them years of picking cotton.  Is that what it does?  In the sun.  Is there lanolin in that or something that gets on your hands and aloe?  It's got aloe in it.  Yes, sir.  Tracy does white boy humor for us.  I mean, it's a lot of cotton jokes.  Jesus.  Hey, me and my girl, Tracy, I've got to say it. 
[02:05:30]  We're huge fans of 30 Rock.  The funniest show on TV by far.  Thank you.  And finally, they let Tracy be Tracy on TV.  Finally.  Yeah.  Not saying the other things you did weren't great, but now we get to-  You found my voice, yeah.  Well, me and my girlfriend are saying, because you were on our ONA Traveling Virus, it's like,  this is the Tracy we all got to see on the stage and behind the scenes, and it's finally  on TV this way.  Yeah, but you know, everything in its place, everything in its time, you know, and it's  the right format, and I'm happy. 
[02:06:00]  I'm glad.  I don't think you're even following a script, barely.  They're giving you ideas like, we need to do this, right?  I'm on the set.  I'll put it out there.  The writers pick up.  They put it out there, and I'm glad.  The Pee Wee Herman episode didn't get enough attention.  Pee Wee Herman in the wheelchair.  Oh, God, was that sick.  Holy crap.  If you haven't seen it, good, search it.  That's nice.  Somebody got shot at the Source Awards.  I didn't see it yet.  It was Pee Wee hard.  That's nice.  You got to do it.  All right, I'll check it out tonight.  But Pee Wee Herman, go to YouTube and check it out. 
[02:06:30]  It was an unbelievable character on 30 Rock.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  We have a lot of fun over there.  Everybody is having fun over there.  We all cool.  Everybody, the first season, everybody's still getting along.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That'll end.  They're getting along part, you know.  I'm going to have a good time, though.  No, the show has hit its stride, and Alec Baldwin is just amazing.  Yeah, he's an intense dude, man.  I hope you don't take my manhood, you know.  And the gay page there is a funny character, too, man.  Oh, yeah.  Kenneth.  It's just, I mean, if you haven't checked out 30 Rock, you really need to. 
[02:07:00]  Right on.  Did you always get along with Tina?  Yeah, that's my girl.  Yeah.  She's a good people, man.  She says she's not, you know, busybody.  She does her job.  She writes, and she's very smart.  She knows she has my voice, and she's letting me be me on the show.  So, I'm having a good time.  Because I'm thinking, like, she probably, did she have any say in who got picked, like,  for the cast?  Absolutely.  I was the first person.  And you were the first person?  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  Because I'm thinking, like, there's a long line of people, especially from SNL. 
[02:07:30]  That's that chemistry from, you know, when we were on Update, you know.  And I used, whenever, she would love to write pieces for me to come on Update, so we had  fun on Update.  And that's where that came from.  Yeah.  And Rachel Dratch is over there, and everybody is having a good time.  And she got, like, regular, like, street people on the show.  Big.com and Grizz, the big two black guys, you know.  So, she's using everybody around, so it's good.  Yeah, it's got a real New York feel to it.  I can't wait to get back on stage with you guys.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:08:00]  O&A Traveling Virus?  Oh, yeah.  We're pumping that out.  No, this is Shakespeare's fake right here.  You have no idea how much fun we had.  Oh, just wait.  A full bar backstage.  Just wait.  I mean, all of that, man.  Yeah.  Baby, yeah.  Babies being made, everything.  Tracey, I think we're going.  Use condoms on the floor, all kinds of things.  I was on stage in front of 10,000 people in Philly, and I could hear Tracey backstage while  I was on stage.  Yeah, Tracey was doing something backstage.  He was doing his old football coach. 
[02:08:30]  Right.  From high school.  And I was sliding in the first.  Yeah.  He's sliding in the first as Jimmy's doing it.  Off the bag.  Off the bag.  I thought it was an echo bouncing off the back of the arena.  I'm like, what is that?  It was him.  How does he drown out 10,000 people?  It was mind-boggling.  Dude, yo, I'm happy, man.  When I'm hanging out, and I'm with people that I got things in common with, I'm letting  it all hang out.  It's rock and roll.  We are having a good time.  We're doing 10 dates this summer.  We went from four to 10. 
[02:09:00]  I know I got at least 80, though.  Yeah.  You might be busy, though.  Put me down, brother.  You're blowing up again.  We just sold a movie, me and my brother.  Yeah?  Congratulations.  Yeah, we getting ready to do a movie.  We wrote a movie with Neil Brennan.  I had an idea, and we went out there just ... We got back last night, and we did, like, 11  pitch meetings.  We met Steven Spielberg.  And George Louis.  Whoa.  Oh, look at that.  Big time.  Dreamworks might pick it up.  Oh, just thought I'd scare you, Tracy.  Just thought I'd shake you up a little bit. 
[02:09:30]  Uh-oh.  Wow.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What the ...  It's me, you ...  Nothing worse than looking in your rearview and going, oh, no.  Oh, dude.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  He's following me.  He's following me, but I think I'm cool.  I think I'm ...  Oh, no.  Oh, son of a bitch.  Oh, no.  I know I'm going to get a pass.  Nah.  Listen, Tracy.  The only difference between the guy, like, pointing this out and you is he hasn't gotten 
[02:10:00]  caught yet.  Yeah.  You got a couple of passes.  Who is he kidding?  It happens.  You know.  He's had a few passes.  Get a couple of passes here and there.  Knock wood.  I got ...  Nah, I don't want to ...  You know, we're fun about it and all that, but it's not cool to drink or drink.  I don't want to sit out the wrong message, but the night was going great until they pulled  me off.  See, I didn't even ...  The night was smooth.  I was a mile away from my house.  Oh, it's always a mile away.  Crazy people approached me in the clubs.  I don't even ...  Crazy comments and stuff.  I was like, wait a minute.  This doesn't happen. 
[02:10:30]  You know, usually you go out, people know who you are, and then they just want to mess  with you and let me get in his head and let me live rent-free and that didn't happen.  You had a great night.  I had a great night.  See, I just want to know, like, your mindset.  I don't care about, like, other details and stuff.  I just want to know what went through your mind right when ...  I knew how they was going to arrest me.  He gave me a mind test and I stepped on his boot three ...  No, I mean, what happened?  Oh, Jesus.  Then I looked him up and down and said, move your foot. 
[02:11:00]  You're done at that point.  Yes.  You're done, so you might as well have a little fun.  I kept stepping on his boot.  I just want to know what happened, like, so you're driving.  Now, did you see a cop behind you or anything?  He got unmarked.  Unmarked.  So, but he's on your ass, right?  And then the lights hit you.  Yeah.  Now, right then, did you go, uh-oh.  He's going down.  Oh, boy.  Did you try?  Did you try?  Yeah.  Yeah, you got to give it the world.  So, you pull over.  He comes to the window.  Now, did you look and go, oh, gee, was it a black guy or a white cop? 
[02:11:30]  White cop.  White cop.  People don't say problem, officer.  We don't do that.  No.  That's just going to make the matter worse.  What?  Are you offending my sensibility?  You can see it in a white cop's face.  Oh, Jesus.  What did I do, officer?  What?  What?  You know what you did.  You going down, you street punk.  Now, did he recognize you?  Yes.  So, he comes to the window.  I said, have mercy on me.  Oh, help me out.  He said, you give me an essence with a quickness. 
[02:12:00]  Gave my keys to my cousin, and he was more lit up than me.  I said, oh, my goodness.  Oh, no.  So, now.  You get to a piece, and everybody's asking for your autograph.  My DUI was on CNN.  Yep.  That's on my reel.  It made big news.  I put that on my reel, man.  We got to see the serious Tracy coming out of court.  Yeah.  The serious.  Yeah.  I'm serious.  Because they tell you, no, don't make light of this. 
[02:12:30]  This is something that we don't want light made of this.  Yeah.  And like you said before, you know, it's obviously you shouldn't be doing that.  But the thing that hurt me, though, man, because the next day, and I found out that  night when I came home from jail, and I got off the shower and stuff, and I was in  the bed crying with my wife.  Oh, no.  Oh, man.  That night, I found out on the news that I was supposed to light the Christmas tree  at rock and roll the next day. 
[02:13:00]  You were lit.  All right, listen.  Black people, man.  I could have been there.  You put me in the books with Paul Robinson.  You could have been the first.  I was going to be in Tiger Woods at the Christmas tree.  Tiger Woods at the Christmas tree.  I was in the ghetto to the Christmas tree.  I blew it.  Unfortunately.  I blew it.  They're going to cut us off here.  All right.  You're joining us over next time, Tracy, for a little bit?  Let's take a walk.  All right, listen, 30 Rock, got to check out 30 Rock, Tracy's amazing on that show,  the funniest show on TV.  And Caroline's this week.  And that's really good.  Caroline's, yeah.  Hey, am I safe if I go to Caroline's tonight? 
[02:13:30]  You're safe if you go to Caroline's tonight.  All right, very good.  It's safe.  Well, I've seen his audience.  They love him in the hood.  Of course.  It's like a few white guys in the hood.  He's a crossover.  He's a crossover.  Yeah.  All right.  He'll host a white rapper show.  If you're white, you'll be safe at Caroline's this weekend with Tracy Morgan.  How's that?  Unless you're in Poughkeepsie, then you'll be safe at my show.  All right, guys.

[02:15:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:16:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:16:30]  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country. 
[02:17:00]  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. 
[02:17:30]  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of town all PM.  You know I can have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver. 
[02:18:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  Here we are at XM Satellite Radio.  We got a great crew today.  We got Tracy Morgan playing Carolines all weekend long here in New York City.  Yes, sir.  Got to turn you down a little bit.  And Bill Burr.  I had you piled up too high there.  And Bill Burr.  And, of course, Bradley, right?  Yes, sir.  And Bradley in the house with us today.  In the house.  What's wrong, Anthony?  Again, no pal talk. 
[02:18:30]  Three days in a row.  Like, longer than that, I think.  The whole week.  Whatever.  Well, cheer up.  Barack is going to be president.  It's all going to work out.  You get ready to have a black president.  I can't wait till that shit happens.  We're all ready.  Yo, we can curse on this one, right?  Oh, yeah.  That motherfucker going to be president for a year.  Then they going to off that nigga.  No, he's not.  He's going to be president.  As soon as he make one change, they go off this nigga.  No, he's not.  We've got to get rid of this nigga. 
[02:19:00]  The first speech he gives, he's going to say nigger six times.  Oh, man.  This is his inaugural speech.  You know something?  No, then I would love to see that.  This is his first speech, yeah.  I need all you, ah, cut.  I would love to see that.  This is his first president you speak.  Let me tell you something.  I need you niggas to get you.  I would love to see him just get it with all of you.  Not.  Like after getting up and going, you know, yes, I'm running for president of the United States  of America.  And the second he gets elected, it's just like, yo, my nigga. 
[02:19:30]  Let me tell you something, motherfucker.  That's what he's going to say.  Let me tell you something, motherfucker.  Just walks up to that party.  Oh, he's going to grab his dick.  The old 1970s black power sign.  He's going to grab his dick.  Believe it, fuck Michael Jackson.  He's going to grab his dick.  Smack.  He's a brother.  He's going to come to the White House every morning with the do-rag on.  The New York Post will run that fucking grab the dick picture every day.  And then he'll be grabbing his dick, getting on Air Force One, grabbing his dick off the  helicopter, grabbing his dick out of the White House, and he'll just, every fucking 
[02:20:00]  picture will be him grabbing his dick.  You know what happened next?  He's going to go abroad.  He's going to go abroad and grab his dick, shaking the president of some foreign country,  grabbing his dick.  Keep grabbing your dick, fool.  Then they're going to have him have a parade in, like, Detroit, and a pimped-out 63 Lincoln.  63 Lincoln with five doors, taking a really extra slow left-hand turn.  Put some D's on it.  He's going to put some D's on it, and his third year, he's going to catch 
[02:20:30]  chlamydia from some bitch over a Marcy Project, some bitch from Marcy.  Hanging out with Jay-Z.  Hanging out, he's going to catch chlamydia, hanging out with some bitch from Jay-Z Project  from Marcy.  Big brother's already in his ear, man.  They already got a microchip in the back of his head.  Oh, yeah.  They own him already.  He knows exactly what to continue doing in Iraq.  They're not going to let you get in there with a free spirit.  There's no way.  They took his brain out in the primary. 
[02:21:00]  It's not a fucking Chris Rock movie.  It's going to blow this bitch up before we see you with it.  Everybody will be dancing in the White House.  All the old white people will be, like, doing hip-hop.  They're going to have African band party there.  Party people.  Party people.  So it's time to get funky.  But for the game to get funky.  It just ain't going to happen.  It ain't going to happen.  Not like that.  JFK was the last one who actually believed that there wasn't a bunch of levels beyond  his job.  Above him. 
[02:21:30]  I'm president.  What I say goes.  We were talking about that the other day and saying how George Bush got in.  George Bush.  He put one of his fingers up under his cabinet speaker's nose because they was hanging out  last night.  And he finger popped some chick, but his cabinet speaker didn't believe it.  This is what Nancy Pelosi's pussy smells like.  No.  I know if I spend $80 at a strip club, these three fingers better stink in the morning.  I know that.  I want some sink finger.  $80, I want my elbow to smell.  Oh, this fist better stink, goddammit. 
[02:22:00]  My foot better itch.  Pussy is still the best thing going.  Better than seven and up.  Seven up.  Seven up.  Seven and up.  I hope it's a little above that, you know.  Now, pussy's number one on the charts.  Consider it.  I don't think seven up's number two.  Make you feel better.  I take ginger ale over seven up.  At the end of the day, somebody got to kiss it and make it better.  Goddamn.  Somebody got to kiss it and make it better.  It's going to be all right.  They are very excited about a black president over there, man.  They can't wait.  We were talking the other day about George Bush and how he got into office and his hair 
[02:22:30]  was kind of brown and stuff and then how it just turned fucking white overnight.  And that's when they bring him into that room and tell him the fucking deal.  That's when they take him in the room and go, here's who shot Kennedy and why.  Now we'll bring it down to the alien room.  We want to show you the alien in the ship.  Oh, shit.  And he comes upstairs and his hair is just fucking gray.  Oh, shit.  It's some shit.  Bill Clinton's hair turned white.  Turned white.  That's what happens.  They take you to a room and let you know.  Look, first of all, that whole election thing is cute and all and everything, but we put 
[02:23:00]  you here and now here's a motherfucker with a black ring or some shit.  Here's all the stuff you have to know.  And if you tell anybody, well, here's the 18 different angles of Kennedy being shot that  we never showed you.  Yep.  That's pretty much it.  This one happened a mile away.  So Obama would have to, you know, he's just going to be.  No, if he win, yo, he ain't going to give a fuck. 
[02:23:30]  He got his own crew.  A crew.  He got a crew.  Let me tell you something.  That motherfucker still got coke on the streets.  He's still getting street money.  Ain't going to happen.  Ain't going to happen.  They're dealing with the Illuminati here, man.  Blow this motherfucker up.  The Illuminati is not scared of a crew.  The Illuminati.  Blow this motherfucker up before they see a black motherfucker.  Yo, we got a crew.  Oh, yeah?  Is that right?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  We got the globe.  We have aliens.  Yeah.  We have fucking alien ships.  Oh, you got a crew. 
[02:24:00]  Two percent of us are aliens.  Yes.  We're running three planets.  You're a lotus motherfucker.  Tell me about Morrissey.  We mad about Eddie Murphy not winning.  So is Eddie Murphy left.  Come on, fucking.  Who you got?  What's his name?  I think they overhyped that.  That guy never seems like he goes out parties anyway.  You're Forrest Whitaker.  Oh, yeah.  You got Forrest Whitaker.  You're wearing a cape and fucking flew out of her.  Yeah, we gave you Forrest Whitaker.  Yeah, I know.  And we gave you a...  Well, you don't win anybody, Lee.  Yeah.  There's different rules for fucking Eddie.  And we gave you the fat girl from Dreamgirls. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, we gave you two this year.  Yeah.  Jennifer Hudson and Forrest Whitaker.  And Forrest Whitaker.  That was nice.  You got Hallie and...  You can't have a Negro trifecta.  All right, you talked.  At least...  All right, you talked.  Three can't motherfucking win.  You can't have a Negro trifecta.  At least the fat chick didn't lose her mind like Hallie Berry did.  Come on, man.  Because black people starting to fucking win every year, though.  They're going to change their fucking statue.  They're going to put an afro on that motherfucker.  That motherfucker going to have an afro, too.  And a big dick.  And a big dick. 
[02:25:00]  You can't have a bigger damn bone.  One arm is going to be a cross.  Another one is going to be holding his dick, so...  They need to change that NBA symbol, too.  They know that shit's for...  Yeah, who is that?  Who is that?  Jerry West.  They need to change that shit to Michael Jordan.  Oh, absolutely.  Motherfuckers were wearing coochie cutters before Michael Jordan.  Motherfuckers going for a rebound, you see half his ass cheek hanging out.  That's what Jerry West was playing.  One ball.  With the big socks.  All the way up there.  Half his ass cheek hanging out. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, they were in thigh highs.  They were in thigh highs.  My mother sit down, press her knees, man.  That must have been really awkward for the black players back in the day.  Do you want me to cover up my jumper on my dicks, hanging out my pant leg?  I think Gilmore's cock in the air.  Right.  You could dribble with the head of your dick.  Fucking chamberlain's balls all on your neck on a dunk.  Half his ass cheek hanging out.  That's why I got all those points in that game and the unit in everybody's face.  Come on, man, motherfucker. 
[02:26:00]  People gotta do it.  There's fucking package in everybody's face.  The whole arena smelled like penis.  Penis and hairspray.  Nuts wet.  Holy shit.  Oh, God damn.  Come on, man.  The arena.  Tracy will be doing this.  All back didn't figure that out.  All back didn't figure that out.  Michael Jordan, you revolutionized basketball.  Get the Jemmy West shit out of here and put the jump man up.  My fellas was wearing tight shorts. 
[02:26:30]  Jordan was able to make all those moves because his junk was finally covered nicely.  Come on, man.  Bob McAdoo didn't create that.  He didn't have to be shy anymore.  He could stretch his legs and all.  He was.  He was the first guy who kind of almost did a split when he did his dunk.  You weren't doing that back in the day with those tight shorts.  Yeah, they used to jump like Catholic school girls with their legs together.  You had to jump straight up so your junk doesn't fall out.  My fellas was playing football with no face mask and leather on their head. 
[02:27:00]  Leather.  I say, yeah, Jerry West, Don, Michael Jordan should be the symbol of the NBA.  Although Whitey's making a comeback in the NBA.  There's a lot of bullshit out there, man, we need to talk about.  What the fuck they got the Rocky Balboa statue up in Philly for?  Oh, they put that one back up?  Put the Joe Frazier shit up there, man.  Yeah, why don't you put the real boxer up?  Balboa, Balboa can't beat that one.  Did you just say that sounds familiar?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a Billy Byrd joke.  That's a Billy Byrd.  That sounds familiar.  Jesus Christ, Gracie.  At least let me leave the room. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, fuck.  But yo, listen.  Chase is like, I know I heard this somewhere.  Well, there's a guy across the room from you.  Oh, shit.  I didn't need to show up today.  He didn't know it was you with all the booing that was going on at the time.  I heard it from somebody else.  But listen.  It's true because you look at, you seen that last fucking Balboa movie.  He's texting.  Yeah.  He's not beating.  What's the guy's name?  Antonio Tarver.  He's not beating Antonio.  Roy Jones couldn't even beat this motherfucker twice.  He didn't win the fight.  Did you see Antonio?  I mean, Roy Jones Jr. is going to be on Pros vs. Joes. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  Really?  They're getting younger and younger athletes who are still like bitter and still in shape.  Once you start doing programs like that, your career's over.  Yeah, but I'm talking about how bad is he going to hurt somebody.  It's not like he's 50.  He just lost.  He's still mad.  He's going to fight a plumber from Wisconsin who did some crunches.  That guy's going to get killed.  People don't fucking, people don't like to let shit go.  People don't like to let shit go.  Bill Burr's still mad at me.  I did his fucking bit. 
[02:28:30]  I'm not mad at you.  If you did it in a club, you did it on the radio in front of a crowd that heard me do it.  You know what?  And he fucking told me that the other day.  And this guy told me that the other day.  Bill Burr said a funny joke.  Jimmy's the guy sitting at the end of the on-ramp looking over his shoulder trying to get on the freeway here.  That's like, fuck, I can't.  I don't know.  It's like L.A. where the light's just going to be red the whole time.  Yeah, it's like, what the fuck?  The person ends up at the end of the on-ramp looking over their shoulder. 
[02:29:00]  You should be on it, though.  I am on it.  Thank you, Tracy.  Well, well, well.  Well, well, well, well, well.  Yeah, Bunny Ranch guys here.  Dennis, Dennis Hoff.

He's walking out.  Tracy can't even just stay in the studio.  He's going to try to talk to a girl from the Bunny Ranch.  Tracy's out.  Can we get a mic on him?  He's working.  He's getting a mic on Tracy.  He's giving Dennis a big hug from the Bunny Ranch.  Tracy is working the room now.  Jesus.  Ah, girl.  What's up?  What's up?  Look at him.  Squeezing ass.  Look at him.  He just grabbed two handfuls of ass. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  He went to hug.  His hands were already in ass cheek.  Yeah.  Ass cheek position.  Oh, wow.  That's totally uncovered now.  What do you think, Jim?  Really naked?

Hey, we have a ho and it's the best thing going.  That's what it is, and you know what it is. 
[02:31:00]  Can I smell your finger?  Why is he speaking like Carlito?  Oh, yes.  That's what it is.  Smell like buffalo wings and butthole.  He just smelled dead as a little bit.  I love me some butthole.  Oh, my God.  Do I need this?  Hey, Tracy.  Come on back here.  Look at that.  Dennis, can he get some butthole?  Yeah.  Tracy.  Tracy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sure.  You don't need an ATM machine.  Sure.  It's on us.  Yeah, it's radio. 
[02:31:30]  Wow.  Tracy, you could get butthole.  Look at stupid Andrew's face out there.  Yeah, we got Big A here, too.  Big A is here, and he is going to lose his mind.  That's good when you're going to talk to a girl's face and chew gum while you're drinking  coffee.  You're an asshole.  Yeah.  We need coffee.  We haven't had a girl here.  It's been so long since we've had girls in the studio.  Yeah.  No way.  I'm going to go out on a limb here.  I think these girls are goers.  I think they're goers.  I don't know about that. 
[02:32:00]  I think they might.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Almost down.  She's almost.  No, and then back up.  Oh, you see what she did?  She teased us.  She teased us.  Damn it.  I got to go back to get more money.  All right, here.  Now, now.  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait.  Oh, and then she lifted it back up again.  I'm sensing a trend.  Wait for it.  Here we go.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  She's pulling up.  This is exactly why I never go to titty bars.  And I see a little cat. 
[02:32:30]  And that's just pulling up her little pink top.  No.  Jesus.  I thought it was going to happen.  I see a little bit of it.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  That's it.  There you go.  That's it right there.  That took a while.  No, that's it.  That's the three acts of the stripper dance.  That's more than the last ten girls who have been in here.  It's not put together. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, pretty, pretty, pretty ladies, too.  Steve, what do we got going on today?  Pretty ladies.  Oh, we got it.  Let's not get it.  Well, we have disgusting naked girls, which I hate because I'm a homosexual.  We got the smart peddler in studio.  And just pretty much cleared it up.  I'll leave now.  Uh, we have.  Tracy, what do you think is going on with this guy?  I don't know, man.  Take a look.  We've been trying to figure it out.  Something's going on.  Not Metro.  I guess he's a straight dude, right?  Of course.  Good?  He's good to go?  He's a big bear.  See?  He's a big bear of a man. 
[02:33:30]  Well, we've been trying to get Dennis and the girls in for some time.  We finally figured out how I think we're going to make it work.  Big A's going to come in and do his usual news bit, but he's going to have sort of a  distraction going on.  A distraction going on while he's doing the news.  Now, him doing the news alone is difficult for him.  Right.  Should we do the news or like maybe one of those tongue twisters?  Tongue twisters.  We could do a tongue twister.  Why don't you do both?  Tongue twister with girls grinding their pieces.  We can do that.  Yeah.  On the side of his 12-pack shaped head. 
[02:34:00]  Let's have the girls crawling on him.  I've seen this, man.  Get Dennis and Mike there.  You ever seen this, Opie?  Huh?  HBO's Cat House?  I haven't.  Oh, man.  Dude, this is crazy.  It's insanity.  I think, who's the news guy?  Big A's out there.  Oh, Big A's out there, yeah.  Oh, the girl's crawling all over his ass.  Let's see if he can read them.  Oh, he's going to be fucked.  Where's he at?  I don't like the news guy.  He's out there.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Dennis.  Where's he at?  Dennis, come in for a second.  She just put that lottie pop in her throat.  Oh, yeah.  She just put that in her throat. 
[02:34:30]  Dude, this is America's dick sucker, this one.  America's dick sucker.  You heard it here first.  I've trained this bitch for 13 months.  Yeah.  This is my private deal, and I've trained her.  She's highly trained.  Wow.  You personally train her, huh?  Yeah, I've got a piece of equipment that we brought in today that we'll get her off.  You guys can get her off in less than five, six, seven seconds.  You'll make her have an orgasm.  Does she squirt?  Really?  She can squirt.  Yeah, absolutely.  But it's like six, seven seconds. 
[02:35:00]  It's a brawn toothbrush that we've adapted, and it's an incredible piece of stuff.  A brawn toothbrush that's been adapted to pleasure a woman and get her off in five seconds.  Last week we heard about the brawn toothbrush.  The orgasm will start in five, six seconds, and it'll be full orgasm in ten seconds.  Guaranteed.  Wow.  Guaranteed.  My wife is getting her ass whooped when I go home.  And I'll have Bunny do it to her disperse with it, and you guys can just go.  We'll watch.  I'm a white man all day.  What's your wife's name?  When I go home, I'm going to leave that professional. 
[02:35:30]  What's your wife's name?  I'm going to leave that professional.  I think Ron Jeremy and I fucked her.  What's her name?  I'm a disco.  Okay, Halliburri.  You must know, God damn it.  Wow, yeah.  Dude, who's the luckiest fuck in the world?  I sit with these great-looking girls.  You sit with this fucking crew.  Bunch of guys, I know.  Every morning you're doing this.  Could you bring her in and let me see her ass?  Yeah, how about bringing the ladies in?  Can I see the butthole?  Oh, she's got the spectacular ass.  Can I just see the butthole?  Jesus.  All right, Tracy needs to see butthole.  I need to see it.  What can you see one mob and close up? 
[02:36:00]  Who's the luckiest guy here?  I love that Phil is here.  Jim, look at this.  You've got to just psychoanalyze this whole situation.  I am so with Bill.  It's so funny.  He cries in front of my sleep.  That's sad.  Our HBO show.  The first one that came out a couple weeks ago.  Oh, look at this.  I'm so with you.  Oh, yeah.  Don't do this.  He's the loneliest man on the planet.  It's a kitty taste.  Oh, look at that. 
[02:36:30]  There's a girl going down on another girl out there.  Through the glass here.  There's something going through the glass.  Look at this.  Wow.  This is the first time this whole crew stood up in a month in the studio.  All right, get a mic out there, will you?  Yeah, right here.  60 years old again.  How about we take the mic away from Dennis for a second?  All night long, I dealt with this.  Now it's time to play Real or Fakin' It.  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  That's real.  That's a real one.  I love that.  I love the sound.  Oh, my God.  I had it this morning.  It's official.  Oh, yes.  It's a beautiful thing.  We showed on our first show this season, we showed Brooke Taylor coming to the ranch,  getting off the airplane, and actually having sex with her first client.  Which one is it?  The blonde sitting down.  Sitting down.  No comment.  We showed her her first party.  She went from being a square chick case manager for the mentally disabled to...  A case manager for the mentally disabled?  Yeah.  With a pussy like that? 
[02:37:30]  With a pussy like that?  Yeah.  And now she gets to sound retarded.  And she went from being a hooker and a porn star all in one falsehood.  How many of those fuckin' retards are just jacking off to her just at night?  I never asked her about that.  The parents come back, their kids seem more retarded.  Nah, he's just turned on, man.  What's that happen?  I don't know.  We spilled some mashed potatoes fell in his lap.  All right, let's get to the...  Take a moment.  Clean your kid up.  He's a mess.  Let's see the toothbrush. 
[02:38:00]  Let's get the toothbrush.  Brooke, get the toothbrush.  Yeah, how about the girls come in here so we can talk to him or something?  This is great stuff.  All right.  What a way to start the day.  Yeah.  Who needs special cake?  Breakfast of champions.  She was just having a breakfast of champions.  Okay, now here, I'd like to have Bunny.  Look at those legs, man.  Now, where are we going to put Brooke so you guys can see?  Right there on the table.  There you go.  Yeah, there you go.  Jimmy would be...  That's perfect.  Right in front of Jimmy.  If you want to lay down up there or something, that's fine, too. 
[02:38:30]  You can lay down on this.  Clear those newspapers out of here.  Get something to make the girls' head comfortable.  How are you?  That's it, Anthony.  Bill, how are you doing?  Huh?  You doing good?  I'm doing great.  Why wouldn't I be?  I'm just here to add to the show.  I love it.  You've got a few people on your side.  Is it okay, guys, is it okay if Norton pulls her panties off?  Well, Norton, is it okay if you pull her panties off?  You've got to go for it now, so I have to watch out.  Is it okay, Norton?  Well, for radio, I'll do it.  Yeah, he's just for radio. 
[02:39:00]  Please remove the panties.  All right.  Norton's allowed to do it for radio.  I think you're going to lay, like, up here.  Yeah.  And then we'll get...  Yeah, that'll work.  Get the newspaper.  Could someone get the fucking newspaper?  Oh, wait.  We brought in...  No one can see down there.  Hold on.  We brought the couch out of retirement.  You want to know that?  We bring it up on the console.  Yeah, couch is a class.  Put the couch up on the console.  Right here.  Yeah, it's got to be right there.  Uh-oh. 
[02:39:30]  Put it in the center.  Hop up there.  How cool is...  If we're going to take our panties off,  or are we just going to sit here and fuck around all day long?  There we go.  Hey, now.  Is it up there or no?  Saturday in the box.  Here we go.  Jimmy is...  Pull it down.  Oh, but only for the radio.  Oh, just for the radio.  He is a great remover.  Little pink panties are coming down.  Look at him.  That's a for real vajayjay right there.  That's a jayjay.  Look at that. 
[02:40:00]  Jimmy's like a scientist in the pyramids.  He's just excavating the panties off.  He's slowly using a brush and a teaspoon.  I don't think scientist was the right word there.  What was that, Anthony?  An archaeologist?  There you go.  He's like a guy with a lab coat.  Wait, they...  Look at the toothbrush.  They redid the toothbrush here.  Someone want to explain what you made the toothbrush into?  What this is, is a brawn toothbrush with an adapter.  Yeah.  And it's got a little round thing on the end of it that makes it go like 3,000 times a second or so.  Slide over, Bunny, so the guys can get a view.  Over here. 
[02:40:30]  That's like a crazy...  Cheat to ONA.  I think Bunny needs to give it a kiss.  Cheat over there.  Oh, isn't that nice?  Bunny needs to...  Turn this way a little bit more so they can see.  Uh-oh, uh-oh.  That's very nice.  All right.  No, no.  Oh, oh.  One.  Two.  Three.  It's not about you.  Oh, can I be the moron in the infomercial?  Wait a minute.  You're saying that she's going to come in six minutes? 
[02:41:00]  Seconds.  Oh, sorry.  Six seconds?  Oh, God.  Say, choke me, Daddy.  Choke me, Daddy.  Oh.  Oh, choke me, Tracy.  Choke me.  Oh.  We'll be calling 911.  We're in front of our channel.  It crashed.  It's like Tracy's Lamar.  I want to see her squirt, man.  All right, not too much, because I want O&A to try this.  Well, Bill will try it, or... 
[02:41:30]  Wait a minute.  You guys got girlfriends here today?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, oh, for, you know...  I would love to.  I like the guests to get all the pleasure on their own.  Yeah, we like to let our guests have all the fun.  Yeah, that's fine.  Turn around to Tracy.  That's fine.  I say, if anyone's going to do it, it should be fucking Big A.  Very nice.  Big A.  Big A.  All right, let's get Big A.  Big A.  Come on.  Big A.  Oh, wait.  Get Big A.  Big A just got kicked off the police force for killing a hooker. 
[02:42:00]  What's up, Big A?  How you doing?  All right.  Can you show Big A what you're sporting there, please?  Big A, what do you think of this?  We want to see you really start stammering.  You put it in her ear.  Big A.  All right.  Oh, they just handed Big A a weapon.  He's going to try to use it like a knife.  Oh, my God.  Buddy, please teach him.  Can I get that camera up?  All right, Big A, watch.  Anthony, why do you know this audio is going to be playing at one of his trials in the future?  Oh, I know.  I didn't mean to kill her. 
[02:42:30]  It all started on people.  All right.  The one girl's...  Hold on, hold on.  The one girl's showing Big A how to use the toothbrush with the new attachment.  On the vagina.  On the vagina.  Big A, you're paying attention.  He's not looking too excited, though.  He's not looking too excited, though.  He's not looking too excited, though.  He's not looking too excited.  He's not looking.  He's not looking.  Right at the test.  How about you?  And she'll come in second.  All right, Big A, you think you can get this done?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, fuck.  No.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, fuck.  First time we got something going on in the fucking studio like this and fucking Paltug is  working.  Norm's going to be pounding his old lady hard at night after watching this.  Livid pissed at fucking XM.  First fucking time we got shit going on like this in a matter of how long.  We have no cameras today?  And there's no fucking cameras working.  Yours is working?  I'm trying to do a lot.  Hold on.  Yeah, I know.  Go ahead, Andrew.  All right, we got to see.  Give me a mic.  Be very careful.  All right, Big A is attempting to get the girl off.  Get Big A chewing the gum like he's working on a Ford or something. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, this isn't getting...  I don't think we're going to have the same effect here.  All right, he's...  Wow, he's shaking so much, he can't even...  You have to touch the vagina, stupid.  That's not the vagina.  That's...  Oh, fuck.  Oh, God.  Oh, fuck.  You're missing everything.  You're missing everything, Kev. 
[02:44:00]  I'm nervous.  Relax.  Wow, look how nervous Big A is.  This isn't...  This isn't a game of operation.  There's a whole room full of people watching.  You're nervous.  Relax.  Take out wrenched ankle.  Jesus.  I hate him how to stalk his tongue.  Take out clitoris.  Take out...  Well, what happened?  We can't hear anybody.  You've got to mic these.  What happened, ladies? 
[02:44:30]  What happened, Jimmy?  I think that they were asking her if she would take her, and there's a reason you can't.  I'll tell you guys if you don't...  All right.  Go ahead.  I'll tell anybody, right?  We'll keep it quiet.  Girls on that time of the month, man.  Aw.  Aw.  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  That's all right.  But she's got nice.  Don't stop those shows.  That's a specialty party.  Yeah.  Big A likes that.  That's what's nasty.  Yeah.  That's what's nasty here.  Big A loves that, by the way.  He loves getting his blood wings.  That's creepy.  He likes his face to look like a little kid just ate a cherry pie when he comes walking 
[02:45:00]  away.  With his hands tied behind his back.  Yeah.  Andrew, what do you think of the girl?  Yeah, let's check in with Big A. What's up?  Big A, what do you think?  Shaking.  They're very beautiful.  Yeah.  Did you get a boner?  He's hard as Chinese arithmetic.  Are you kidding me?  Oh.  Did you have fun, Big A?  I did.  You made me cum.  He can't stop tapping his foot. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Tapping that foot.  That's what he does before he strangles a hooker.  Don't worry about it.  Jeez.  Pretty.  Well, now, Big A, did you find that exciting to much?  Yeah.  Hey, look at him.  Yeah.  Look.  Everything.  Very exciting.  Yeah.  He needs a rubdown to relax.  Oh, maybe the girls can give Big A a little rubdown.  Big A, want a rubdown?  You want a couple of the Bunny Ranch girls to give you a little rubdown?  A little rubdown.  Rubdown.  Yeah. 
[02:46:00]  From Big A.  Yeah.  All right.  Big A.  Wow.  Can this console actually hold that much weight?  Ugh.  What does that hand work?  Sorry.  What does that hand work?  What happened, Tracy?  She's got pretty hands.  She's got beautiful hands.  You know, it's the thing about the red nails, the red lips, the red toes.  Is that nasty?  Don't you love that, guys?  Oh, that is wonderful.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Look at the cash.  Wait for the more chins than a Chinese phone book line.  If the police saw the look on Norton's face right now, they would arrest this fucker just  as a preventive measure. 
[02:46:30]  All right.  Are we going to rub down Big A or what?  He's got a couch over here you can sit on.  Big A, get on the couch.  Yeah.  Get on the couch there, Big A.  Have the ladies come over.  Someone, I know, Than, you're very busy on that, but the people will assassinate you  if you do not get this on Pal Talk.  Maybe move the monitor around so you get a good view.  Oh, shit.  It's going down in here.  This is crazy.  I'm trying for you, Pal Talk people.  I really am.  Big A with that gum has got a little swagger to him. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  I don't think he's impressed.  Big A.  I think Big A has been here before.  He's got a little swagger to him.  All right.  Let's mic Big A and the girls.  They're going to try to find what he's sporting, I think.  Try to say something, Big A.  Oh, man.  Paradise, brother.  How are you feeling?  Feeling great.  I'm feeling great.  Oh, boy.  They're not into it at all.  Oh, God.  This is...  I think it just froze.  They're not into it at all. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Much better.  You're going to see some acting now, man.  Are we getting in trouble with this?  We're hanging out with you, motherfuckers.  Are we getting in trouble?  Great nuts.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Enjoy the acting.  It looks like the last scene in Tom.  If you thought the Oscar clips were impressive.  Let's hear the girls act a little more.  I think you froze up.  Big A?  We don't have to act.  It's about what you do with your body.  We don't even have to say anything.  And if you believe that... 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  How hard did you do?  All right, let's listen in for a minute or two.  Girls, take it away.  Yeah, is it really hard?  Not yet.  Does it hurt?  You want to take off your pants?  Oops.  What the hell was that?  Was that a...  God, we don't need that.  Don't worry about it.  Hey, look at your tits right there.  Hey, right all in your face.  Okay, what do you think?  There you go.  Andrew, what do you think?  This is incredible. 
[02:48:30]  This is incredible.  Do you like watching Bunny Suck on my shit?  Oh, yes.  Hey, Big A, I got one question for you.  Ron and Fez don't do this for you, right?  No, not at all.  Yeah, exactly.  No, see?  See?  What's his name?  Got you.  What's your name?  Big A.  That's right.  Big A.  Look how short he made the A.  Big A.  Big A.  He knows.  Look at this.  See, Ron and Fez can't give you this.  Wow.  What's going on over there now?  I think Big A, wow, the front of his pants may be coming down a little bit.  I'm not watching Bunny grind on you. 
[02:49:00]  I'm doing his zipper.  And one of the Bunny girls is just rubbing and gyrating on him.  Boy, these girls are going to be disappointed in about 15 seconds.  Is he hard, Bunny?  Is he getting a little, you know, worked up?  Yeah, he's rock hard.  Oh, boy.  She's not talking about his abs.  And what's going on in the upper region over there?  What are you doing?  Back at the ranch.  I'm just making sure that he's still breathing. 
[02:49:30]  Do you have your pussy in his face?  I did, but he wasn't looking.  Big A.  Andrew, what are you doing?  Look at that snatch.  This will never happen to you again.  Would you be a good egg and sit on his face?  This is your...  Oh, I don't know about that.  Yeah, now we see where the line in the sand is drawn.  Do we have a Listerine?  Do we have Listerine?  Listerine.  Do we have Listerine?  Wow.  Wow, when a pussy is asking for Listerine for the mouth. 
[02:50:00]  Did I just hear a girl at the Bunny Ranch say there's no way she's going to sit on the  case?  Wow.  Yeah.  And they've seen it all.  Well, no, I will, but in the party when I'm getting paid.  I hear you.  This is just a trailer.  I hear you.  This one is off the books on this one.  This one is off the books.  All right.  If she sat on his face, this guy would be robbing a fucking bank later to get to the  Bunny Ranch.  Oh, yeah.  She'd rather sit on a dead horseshoe crab. 
[02:50:30]  That big A's mouth.  All right.  Listen, we need something here.  Rockaway beach.  Exactly.  Rockaway beach.  Rockaway beach.  You fucking syringes.  Rockaway.  Low tide.  Low tide.  Yeah.  Put it right over his face if he doesn't touch.  Andrew, you won't touch it if she puts it over his face.  Yeah.  If she keeps this up, somebody's going to be in a cell.  Put it over his face.  You won't do it.  All right.  We need something.  Very good, Phil.  You're catching on.  I'm catching on.  Yeah.  To the humor that they have.  You didn't hear my line earlier.  Oh, what's that?  I'd like to reiterate to you that big A's got more chins than a Chinese phone book. 
[02:51:00]  Just trying to stick with the humor.  Big A, are you right there, A?  All right.  Big A, what's going on?  Is that a banana in your pocket or are you just happy to see him?  Hey, now.  Big A, what's going on?  That guy is the worst.  What's going on, Steve?  I'm hogs.  He's staring.  The girls are just laughing at his dick.  That's all.  Steve, what's going on? 
[02:51:30]  Andrew is staring deep into a young lady.  She's masturbating right over his face.  And Big A is staring into it like the fucking, his head is going to explode like he looked  into the Ark of the Covenant when they opened that fucker up.  He's got the look on his face that Kyle had after he's fucking got his blanket part of it.  She's rubbing that full skin.  I'm going to come in your pants.  She's rubbing all that full skin.  Big A, she's rubbing his package.  Big A, how does that feel? 
[02:52:00]  Feels great.  Oh, Big A's going to make a smoothie in his pants.  Please make him make a smoothie in his pants.  Can you feel good, Big A?  Yes.  Girls, if you make Big A come in his pants, I'll toss you a hundred bucks.  That's just hysterical.  Just make him come all over his pants, you fucking slob.  I've heard of smoothies, but this is ridiculous. 
[02:52:30]  It's been a long time, my friend.  What's up, Big A?  Do you like this pussy, Big A?  Yes.  Happy birthday, baby.  Yes, I appreciate it.  Do you think about fucking this pussy?  Oh, boy.  Would you come in this pussy?  Yeah?  I'm sure you're about to come in.  Hey, Big A, what would you do with that?  Would you fucking stroke it?  Would you wear protection?  He's licking his lips, is he?  What's going on?  Do you think about tasting this?  It's sweet pussy, Big A.  I can't believe you, Sly, what are you doing?  Big A.  So wet.  I'm rubbing his balls right now.  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  You can find his chocolate.  It's in there.  Cool.  I'm going to come, Big A.  He's got big balls.  You want to come with me?  Yeah?  It's a tumor.  I'm going to come.  I'm going to come with you.  All right, Big A's staring at her.  Rub that skin tag, you pissed at her.  I don't want nothing to ignore me.  Yeah, back up.  I don't want to move down his way.  He's going to blow.  He's going to come in a license plate from Florida.  He's going to come after his dick. 
[02:53:30]  Are you going to come with me, Big A?  Will I touch myself?  And that Kittner boy.  I don't know what you think about coming in this pussy.  Shouldn't one of those girls be in a Princess Leia outfit on a chain?  Tracy, what's going on over there?  Princess Leia has been to the Bunny Ranch, by the way.  Oh, yeah?  Nice.  Think about that.  Big A, what's going on?  I'm going to the Bunny Ranch. 
[02:54:00]  What do you want, Big A?  Tell me what you want.  Oh, jeez, Big A.  Holding out like Johnny the Wad Holmes over here.  Do you want to fuck me?  He looks like he's bombing on Letterman.  Oh, yeah, Himmel or something.  Oh, that is good.  You want to come for me?  Come with me, Big A.  I'm going to come with you.  I'm going to come with you.  I'm going to come in.  Bombing on Letterman.  Oh, wait.  Something's going on over here. 
[02:54:30]  Hold on, hold on, uh-oh.  I'm going to come when you come, Big A.  Oh, you want to come with me?  You can come.  Thinking about coming in my pussy?  Yeah.  Well, could you think about it quicker?  Don't distract him.  Yeah, Big A.  Come on now.  Conversations.  What's going on, Big A?  Feeling good?  There we go.  Here, I'll pass that over.  Very good.  To the lady there.  You want this pussy, Big A? 
[02:55:00]  Pass that over to the lady.  You going to come for Bunny?  He drives a Mustang.  You going to come for us?  There we go.  Now, there we go.  Is that his cock belly?  Gave her a little incentive to maybe tug a little harder.  She's throwing me with the back of her fingers.  Wow.  I'm going to love hearing the story.  Wow.  Coach just gave us a play.  You're some prison lube.  Oh, the audible.  The audible.  You know what's funny?  He's going to come like six times just thinking about this on the way home. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, here we go, baby.  What do you think, baby?  Yeah, I'm big guy.  Oh, God, I'm going to come.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, God, I'm coming.  Oh, fuck.  You want to come in this pussy, Big A?  Yeah, you want to come with me?  For the last time, yes.  You like when Bunny strokes your cock?  Yeah?  Does that feel good?  My father's so big. 
[02:56:00]  Oh.  What did she just say?  Your balls are so big.  Your balls are so big.  And then she's just laughing.  Extremely.  She is so just laughing.  Can she rub your balls?  Does that feel good?  Can't you just imagine coming in her sweet little pussy?  Yeah.  This ain't exactly, you know, George Clooney taking a trip out to the Bunny Ranch one day.  And, you know, maybe one of the girls going, yeah, I'll fucking...  It's not even George Jefferson going to Washington.  Fucking George went. 
[02:56:30]  Big A's having a problem.  Come on, Big A.  What the hell's going on?  He's nervous.  I probably jerked off eight times this morning.  Focus.  Focus.  You got any of that lube up there?  Let's squirt some of that down there.  He's nervous, right?  He's nervous.  Big A's nervous. 
[02:57:00]  Is your mouth a little dry?  You're going to get biceps if you keep floating.  I think the best thing to do right now is to address Big A's nervousness.  Yeah, I think we should talk about it.  Tell him to hurry up.  You look like a deer caught in headlights.  The girls have given up.  The girls are going to get fucking Popeye arms.  Wow, the girls gave up.  The pants are in the way.  Oh, wow.  Well, there you go.  She wants back in the game.  Underpants, I think, are the best way to go.  All right, Big A, why don't you at least... 
[02:57:30]  Just take down to your underpants.  There you go.  Take your pants off, Big A.  He doesn't even know where he is at this point.  Man, go for it.  Big A, how often are you going to get this chance?  Big A, Big A, Big A, Big A, Big A, Big A, Big A, Big A.  Look how red he is.  What's up there, Big A?  Are you all right?  Look how sweaty he is.  Holy shit.  Tracy just got hit with a top. 
[02:58:00]  I'm going to throw it over you.  All right, Big A is now down to his...  Big A is down to his...  Liza Minnelli's father in Arthur is now...  Wow, and one of the bunny girls, totally nude.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  And Big A is sporting black, huge underpants.  Big A's got some big underpants on over there.  All right, Big A.  All right, we're here in phase two. 
[02:58:30]  Phase two.  The waistband's like, you just pulled him up while babysitting when the parents came home.  You're like that.  Oh, God.  Hey, what happened?  What happened?  What are you shy for?  Who cares?  Not looking.  Don't want to see.  All right, here we go.  Now Big A's got some action.  All right, you better mic Big A.  And the girl.  Well...  Bill Burr is crazy.  You like that?  You're a fucking man, Big A.  You like that, Big A?  Talk to us, Big A.  You want that pussy, don't you?  You like me rubbing your dick? 
[02:59:00]  Did you lick this pussy?  Yeah?  Did you fuck this pussy?  Just stroke it with your big hard cock.  Do you want to fuck back?  Yeah.  Do you want to fuck me?  Yeah?  Oh, I'm so wet.  How do you think the Yankees are going to do this year?  I'm just going to taste it.  Better than his cock.  Do you like it when I play with your balls or your dick better?  Yeah.  Both. 
[02:59:30]  Greedy.  Yeah, you're greedy.  Sorry.  Fuck that.  Earn your money.  You going to come with me, Big A?  Yeah?  Think about coming in this pussy.  Big A's staring into one of the girl's pussies.  The other girl jerking him off rapidly through the underwear.  I've got to admit, this is a very quick approach for the first half.  I'm wondering if they're going to be able to stand in the third quarter.  Well, I had a little trouble in the top of the first.  Big A's coming out, though.  It looks like she's squeezing a rosy head.  All right, what's going on down there? 
[03:00:00]  Steve, anything going on?  On the Big A side, not much.  It looks like she's squeezing a rosy head.  Brooke's getting it.  She's big.  She's big.  Bring that pussy, bro.  She's looking as big.  She's getting ready to pitch.  She's squeezing a rosy head.  Oh, boy, the toothbrush is back out.  We put the Ron toothbrush on the cliff.  All right, we know.  She wants to give it to him.  Jesus.  Knocking on that one. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, jeez.  That's true.  Can you turn it back into a toothbrush?  Oh, God.  Oh, God, Big A, I'm going to come.  Oh, can you come with me, Big A?  That makes one of us.  Oh, God, I'm coming.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Can you drop a log on his face while you're doing that?  Just a little one like a Hitler mustache. 
[03:01:00]  Just a little plinko.  The type of shit you take when you haven't had much water into it.  Right.  This goes bloop.  Hey, he's making noise.  Hey, Big A's ready to bust.  Big A.  All right, back to Big A.  Here we go.  Here we go.  You want to come with me?  You're making noises.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my pussy's so wet.  It's so warm.  Oh, you want to be inside this pussy, don't you, Big A?  Oh, yeah, I do. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, would you come in my pussy?  Yeah, would you come for me?  Yeah.  Would you come for me?  You like bunny stroking your cucks?  Yes.  Yeah?  Thank you very much.  Yeah.  You want to come for me?  You want to come for bunny?  Not if you keep bringing it up.  Oh.  That's what an animal called you, Paul.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Come on, you can't let a brick come with you.  Oh.  Here, catch up.  Oh, good.  Oh.  She's up to, like, ten, Big A. 
[03:02:00]  We just need one from you.  Just one.  Oh, good.  You?  Damn.  Ain't that a problem?  Andrew, just zone out.  Just zone out.  Just pretend you're in a cab, and she needs a ride from the airport, and you pull her through  an alley, and you have a coat hanger, and you're going to strangle her.  Try, if you can, for camera.  Yeah.  Just forget the two countries are laughing at you.  Oh, fuck.  I'm coming.  Fan.  Multi-tasking. 
[03:02:30]  That's perfect.  Yeah.  Okay.  Steve's just got to move a little bit.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Big A can do one of those Demi Moore Vanity Fair covers.  They look like...  Yeah, where you just hold your...  They look like they're kind of pushing back into the water.  Come on, baby.  Come down.  You can come for money.  You can't stay down with two hookers on him.  Not with two.  Oh, you guys need that big layer. 
[03:03:00]  Mmm.  A hot load of cum, Big A.  Yeah, you can give it to Demi.  You can give it all to her.  Yeah.  It's like paint thinner.  It's awful.  Yeah, my toothbrush is running out of batteries.  It's like...  No, the toothbrush is...  Wait, wait.  Do you have something?  Come on, baby. 
[03:03:30]  Come for me.  Do you have something?  Come on, Big A.  Give it to me.  Does it happen, Big A?  Look, buddy.  You gonna come for me, Daddy?  Halfway through the...  No!  No!  No!  Oh, my.  I'd tell you something.  How does that not go in?  Are you gonna come with me, Big A?  Yeah?  Come on in.  Oh, I'm gonna come.  Oh, I want you to come with me.  Come on, Big A.  Come on, Big A.  Come on, Big A.  Come on, Big A.  Come on, Pissy.  She's gonna come again.  Did you just say Steve touches you? 
[03:04:00]  Oh, look at those lipstick you're looking at, Pissy.  You guys are distracting him.  You're distracting.  Yeah, don't distract him.  Let's give enough time.  Don't blame us for your technique.  Let's give enough time for this to work.  You might have to bring in the southpaw.  You just keep shaking that band.  We're going to the bullpen, Tracy.  Andrew, I'm the lefty.  Hey, Big A, is there something specific that you want?  He's losing it. 
[03:04:30]  He's a little nervous.  He's a little nervous, you guys.  I guess they're not experts after all.  Come on, baby.  I want you to get for it.  Stop blaming the victim.  Come on, Pissy.  Just think about fucking me.  You're going to fuck me, doggy?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're going to stroke this pussy good with your hard cock?  Hmm?  You're going to fuck me good? 
[03:05:00]  Oh, this pussy is wet for you, Andrew.  It's so fucking hot.  Open your mouth!  They're paying for it.  You eat it!  What happened?  That's not how you pull hair.  But you grab his hair.  Stop from the roof, baby.  What's you got to do?  Put your hands inside his underwear.  Don't take them off.  Just put them inside.  He might need to break your neck.  Hey, God, you are a disgusting.  That's my brother, Kyle. 
[03:05:30]  All right, they're heading up.  That's not her.  He don't give a fuck.  He don't give a fuck.  Put your hands inside his dog.  Take your days to finger-banging.  Go ahead.  Old Mary.  Go ahead.  I'm going to lose you.  Yeah, you go get some moves.  Hurry, take some moves.  Because he's suffering in there right now.  He's suffering.  Put this motherfucker out of his memory, man.  Come on, concentrate, eh?  Hold on.  Focus on the person.  Oh, that'll work.  Look at that butthole, man.  All right.  That'll work.  Yeah, put that on there, baby. 
[03:06:00]  Take care of the man.  Danny, what's up?  I keep getting cold, so I got to switch out with Danny.  All right.  Take your ass out, dude.  All right, Danny's in for Steve.  Here we go.  This is weird.  As we go into the second hour.  Steve, this is a surprise.  Go pop, okay?  I know.  What is this?  Jeremy, you'll be reading page six when something like this was going on.  Go pop, baby.  Go pop, baby.  Oh, there it is.  All right.  Now they got a little bit of a loop.  That'll do it.  And she's taking up a new position.  Look, you're all the troopers.  Up the front.  There it goes.  All right. 
[03:06:30]  All right.  Everybody quiet.  All right.  This is it.  That's better?  Yeah, that's not.  You go over.  That's good.  Turn to the side, baby.  You're not mistaken.  Look at my pussy, big A.  Just focus on my pussy, thinking about fucking it.  Putting your heart cocked deep inside.  Stroking my pussy, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  That's nice and hot.  You're going to come for a bunny, big A?  Yeah? 
[03:07:00]  Does that feel good?  Just stroking your cock?  These girls need more material.  They're like Dad Van.  They've got like five minutes.  Are you going to come for me?  I need you for a minute.  It's over with already.  Oh, fuck.  You like that pussy?  I yet got to come at it.  She's moving them.  My mother.  She's moving them?  Jimmy?  Yeah, she's moving them.  Oh, God.  Oh, fuck.  You're going to come for me, baby.  Oh, God, I'm going to come.  Come on, I know you want to. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, I want you to come deep inside this pussy, big A.  She did that joke on Comedy Central.  You're going to come and set this pussy, huh?  Yeah?  You're going to come for me?  See?  Come on, come for me, baby.  I know you want to.  I'm going to set this pussy.  Yeah.  All right, we got some action now.  You can't just look at Norton's face.  They're distracting him.  I want you to come.  I want you to come, big A. 
[03:08:00]  I don't know what I'm thinking about coming under my face.  As the smell of taint wipes in the air.  Oh, baby, where do you want to come?  Jimmy, what does it smell like over there?  I just want you to fucking come all over me.  From those boxers.  Yeah.  It's the smell of stork has.  You're going to come in this pussy, big A?  Are you fucking me?  Are you going to come in the deep inside of me?  It smells like crib death.  Everyone is holding their noses.  Jesus, Bill, could you keep it down?  Our audience can hear. 
[03:08:30]  It just...  What the hell?  Wait, wait, Jimmy, what?  Tracy, Tracy's clapping.  Tracy, Tracy's clapping.  Okay, just like when we had the bees in the studio.  We can't keep Tracy in the studio.  That's it for me.  He just farted.  That's it.  I'm standing over here on this side.  This is hideous.  This is gross.  This is gross. 
[03:09:00]  Who just pooed it, man?  He said, like, damn.  He said, fucking funny.  He tapped out.  She getting ready to get him up off the couch.  He getting ready to rise up off the couch.  Are you going to come for me?  You going to come?  It's like that toothbrush.  It's out of batteries.  Are you giving up?  I am trying to be a little nervous.  Oh, boy.  You might as well come already, eh?  We've been in that room for about an hour now.  Come on, man.  Wash your hands. 
[03:09:30]  It's okay.  You got more balls than me.  Jimmy has the girl.  She wants to wash your hands.  She goes, unless you want to lick it, and then walk to the bathroom.  She's disgusted.  She's out of here, too, now.  Let me ask you a question.  Would it be helpful, Big A, if you just looked at the girls, and they just kind of, like,  they just showed you their ass a little bit, and you got it?  How about we all leave?  Nothing.  It smells like socks and bus-off in here.  It smells like socks and bus-off.  It smells like anything. 
[03:10:00]  It smells like pissy.  Oh, God damn.  Wait a minute.  No, I'm married, man.  I can't do that.  It smells like the loser's locker room.  This is the Bunny Ranch.  We better get the ranch.  Like some incense.  It smells like...  Well, I don't know, Big A.  I don't know what to tell you.  You know, we...  This is what our TV show's about.  This is what we're doing right now.  What kind of air fresheners and stuff do you have out there at the Bunny Ranch?  We have the pussy flavor.  Pussy flavor and the brown toothbrush. 
[03:10:30]  Is the brown toothbrush a motherfucker?  How long a ride outside of Vegas is the Bunny Ranch?  Well, actually, we're in northern Nevada between Reno and Lake Tahoe.  Carson City, Nevada.  Oh, all right.  The capital.  Yeah, we're at the capital.  And our show's Saturday night after the big fight.  Our second show of the season, and it's going to be over the fucking top, dude.  We're going to do crazy shit like this.  This is all we do is just suck and fuck and be stupid on the TV show.  That is something, man.  That is terrific.  One of the most famous girls from season one blew me, thanks to Dennis.  Oh, yeah?  Isabella Soprano in the world of Astoria gave me oral treats. 
[03:11:00]  You know how fucking cool that is?  Isabella, right, right.  I saw her on the show.  She was a favorite on the show.  Yeah.  And Jimmy, deep-throated.  She said Jimmy is one notch down from Ron Jeremy.  Wow.  She's very complimentary.  That is complimentary.  I believe during Cain.  All right, let's go to Big A.  I believe during Cain.  Big A is pretty much naked on the couch with his other pants on.  Big A, what happened?  He's tired.  Big A, what happened?  Where do you think things went wrong? 
[03:11:30]  1969.  What do you get that first?  I really...  Yeah, what happened?  I got really nervous with everybody.  Yeah, but didn't the good feeling of it kind of counteract the nervousness?  I mean, for God's sake, it's the first time in how long you had a girl's hand on your cock  and another girl's pussy in your face and she's jerking you off.  Well, what happened?  Yeah.  He's not good for his self-esteem.  Yeah, I know.  That's why I do it.  Plus, a room full of guys.  Come on.  Well, you gotta relax.  You gotta relax. 
[03:12:00]  You know what it is?  You take that out of your mind.  You just concentrate.  You stare into that pussy.  Say, fuck them.  It's about us in this universe.  Eye of the Tiger.  He looks exhausted.  We need Greenpeace to get him back on his feet.  He's shaking their pants for like hours shaking his pants.  He needs a nap, man.  Look at that bag.  Got that bag shook this morning.  I bet you Ron and Fez would have got you off, huh?  Get him back to the bathroom.  No.  All right, good.  No.  Good.  Now, what's gonna happen now, big guy? 
[03:12:30]  You know, your balls are gonna fucking be aching.  You're gonna have to, what, finish yourself off or something in the bathroom?  Nope.  Nope.  Wait, what are we doing now?  Sometimes, like with virgins, they jack off so much that when they really get pussy,  it's very difficult for them to have an orgasm.  Ah.  They either do it in like three seconds or three hours.  Yeah.  Really?  You're nervous, yeah.  I see it in the rain.  Brooke?  Oh, yes, doctor.  It's true.  Virgins will either take a really long time or they come really quick, but.  Not just virgins, but guys that don't get it often.  Well, yeah, guys that don't get it often, it can be, if a husband doesn't use condoms 
[03:13:00]  with his wife and using condoms at the ranch, sometimes that can inhibit, but, I mean, he  did good for having two hot chicks next to him, you know, fondling him, fondling myself.  Two countries being.  I think he'd be good.  You never.  And he has an awesome memory to jack off to, so.  Well, there you go.  It's better than looking at a magazine.  You can take that home with you.  Hey, Oak.  Yeah.  You see all kind of stuff at the ranch?  You see everything. 
[03:13:30]  Anything and everything.  Your imagination is your only limitation, so.  Who just said, hey, Oak?  It's Eric.  We're out in the hallway.  Yeah.  We're outside the ladies' room.  Yeah.  And she was either throwing up or dry heaving and making a lot of gagging noises.  Oh, wait, she's coming out.  You all right?  Not enough soap in the world.  Oh.  She smelled her hand.  That's what she did.  She smelled her hand.  Did you smell your hand?  No.  No.  But I think what did it for me was the final gag factor was I was walking out, and dude 
[03:14:00]  was like, oh, you have to be covered up.  You have to be covered up.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  And he brings out this fur jacket to put on me, and I said, you want me to put this over  that?  He's like, what happened?  I just fucking touched this dude's dick.  He's like, oh, go ahead.  And then I looked at it, and there's like the black, you know, like the shit that gets  caught under your flaps.  Yeah.  It's like I clean like a horse's, you know, when you clean up. 
[03:14:30]  A horse sheath?  Wow.  Like when you clean up a horse's sheath?  Like I cleaned a net sheath.  Like that beef jerky.  Wait, she's coming back in.  She's disgusted.  No, I'm good.  No, you're disgusted.  It's okay.  I'm good.  We like the honesty.  She's a pro.  What was going on down there?  I think he was just really too nervous.  No, I mean, what was going on?  The smell?  Oh.  The black stuff ended up on your hands?  Yeah.  Like what?  From underwear?  Well, yeah, I think, you know, from the flaps, like. 
[03:15:00]  Were you dry heaving in the bathroom?  Yeah.  Flaps?  I didn't eat breakfast this morning, so luckily there wasn't anything to come up.  But you started puking?  Why?  Holy Jesus Christ.  Is that hysterical?  Oh, my God.  It's good, though.  It's good for the abs.  I have some brie cheese if you wanted.  Wait.  She was so disgusted.  She was dry heaving in the bathroom.  You know, there's not enough soap in the world.  Oh, God.  Stuck it inside one of those tauntons.  I'm glad mine smells like pussy.  Hold on.  Bradley, what does it smell like?  I washed it. 
[03:15:30]  You're new to the show.  You've got to take one for the team.  What does that smell like?  I washed my forearm.  Remember when Han Solo cut open that taunt-taunt and the player strikes back?  And you see the gun?  The Luke could warm up.  It smells like that.  It smells like dead space camel.  Dead space camel.  Dead space camel.  That's like up to my forearm.  Oh, Tracy's tapping out again.  Tracy's tapping out again.  Where's Tracy going?  Poor Andrew.  What happened?  Do you understand what you've got to do to make Tracy Morgan walk away twice in one second? 
[03:16:00]  He's just like laying on a couch.  They're interviewing in there.  He's just like still laid out on a couch.  That's because Big A's hoping over, you know, beyond hope.  What's going on?  Big A, I've got to tell you something.  Hold on.  It's over.  Big A, what's going on?  Yeah, what's going on, Big A?  Big A, what's going on, Andrew?  He lost game seven.  That's what happened.  He lost game seven.  That's got to be that feeling, yeah.  Postseason right down the toots.  The dude, you guys heard about the dude that tried to stop me and put a coat on me, right? 
[03:16:30]  Did he have a goatee?  Yeah.  Master Pope.  He tried to put this rabbit for coat on my hand.  Or around my guy.  He was like, she's got to be covered.  She's got to be covered.  Got to be covered.  And I'm like, dude, I just touched this dude's dick.  Treat it like a lady.  Yeah.  Did you steal any of my chest pieces?  She's still scrubbing like she has OCD or something.  I know.  That's never going to come off.  She's just washing and washing.  You could just be in the bottom of the shower in the fetal position crying.  Leaving Las Vegas. 
[03:17:00]  Oh, what's the matter?  Now you guys know how my night's going to be.  Hey, Big A.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  Big A, let's talk to Big A.  You all right?  You gave it a try.  You gave it a try.  Somebody tell Al.  Oh, look at him.  He's feeling bad about himself.  It's not anything that hundreds of other men haven't heard.  Big A, there's nothing to be ashamed of here.  You all right, Big A?  We're a family.  It's all good.  Hey, there's no crying and jerking off.  Did you have fun?  Did you have fun, Big A?  You got jacked off.  There's no crying and jerking off.  Come on.  Hey, get your ass up, you freak. 
[03:17:30]  Come on.  Let's go.  Come on.  You want somebody to spark bananas on your body?  Let's show some pride, man.  You want him to hit you in the butt cheek in 2000 greats?  It was weird.  He couldn't come, but he's completely comfortable just laying there, spread eagle.  Yeah, he was hoping.  What happened?  What happened?  Oh, you took his pants.  Andrew.  What's the matter?  Why?  Yeah, he's just laying there.  I think he's getting off now.  He's looking at us getting hard.  You want to get a glove and go at it again?  You want one of those kitchen, those big yellow kitchen gloves?  No, well, she needs one of those. 
[03:18:00]  She needs some mopping gloves or something?  Those falcons.  Gloves a falcon can land on a glove.  I'm coming to the ranch.  Hey, I'm coming to the ranch.  What's his name?  Dennis.  Dennis, I'm coming to the ranch.  Holy shit.  All right, hold on.  Let's get to Big A.  Let's talk to Big A.  All right.  All right, Tresha.  It happens.  I'm quite sure Richard Pryor used to come over there, right?  It felt good, though, right?  Man, it felt real good.  He got to get up.  What's my encourage?  This man in a good dress.  You all right, Big A?  Someone encourage this man. 
[03:18:30]  Is your heart?  You look sad.  Big A, the same thing happened to Ron Jeremy the first time.  You look sad, Big A.  You all right?  Yeah, you all right.  He sweated a storm off.  Look.  Oh, boy.  I don't think he's happy.  He's not stammering anymore.  I don't think he's happy.  You're not sad, are you?  He's got his shoes.  Perfect.  Big A.  He's sad that I didn't make him come.  Yeah, but it's...  He ain't sad.  He's angry, man.  He's not angry.  Are you angry?  His pants are really missing.  He said yes.  He wanted to come.  Who would?  We kept making jokes and Billy Bauer and all that. 
[03:19:00]  Look at that vein he's got in his forehead.  He's angry.  Yeah.  He's angry.  You ready to go at it again?  Some bitch is going to die tonight.  Now it's done?  Yeah.  Check his cab at the end of the night.  Some bitch is going to die.  Some bitch is paying for this tonight.  Hold on.  Let him answer.  What's going on, Andrew?  What's up, man?  What's about Andrew?  What's going on?  He just wants his pants on.  Yeah.  He'll get his pants on and then we can interview him.  Yeah, no one wants to be interviewed without their pants on.  Yeah.  Get his warm-ups back on.  I just didn't like the way he talked, dude. 
[03:19:30]  He's got to tear away dickies.  What is that?  Big A.  Close and personal.  Big A feels like that pitcher that day in the World Series.  First inning, they have to pull him.  Yeah.  And you're like, ah, such expectation.  They brought him up too young.  Yeah.  Calvin Schiraldi.  I'm the luckiest guy in the world.  All right.  Let's interview Big A.  Big A, have a seat.  Big A, there you go.  You got your pants on.  You got your shirt buttoned.  Let's get this couch on you.  A little insight on what happened there, how it felt, your impression of the girls. 
[03:20:00]  Well, we got to do this like you just, the game was on his fingertips.  Yeah, a little post game.  A little post game going on.  Big A.  All right, girls, you can go clean up and we'll talk to Big A.  He might talk more if you guys are out of the studio.  Big A, now the first couple innings, it really looked like you had your A game going.  Yeah, yeah.  We actually thought you were going to have the outcome that we expected.  Things obviously didn't pan out the way we had all planned or expected.  Because what happened?  Five strikeouts, you only walk one batter.  Hey, they're taking the couch away. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Right in the dumpster.  That's like when they had the champagne set up, you were going to drink it, and then they  just have to take it.  Yeah, pull it away.  All the caps that had the logos on it.  86 Red Sox.  86 Red Sox.  They're covering up the ice, getting ready for a Molly Hatchett concert.  They're done.  So what happened, Big A?  What happened there?  What do you think was the problem?  I just got a little nervous.  I mean...  Guys and stuff, right? 
[03:21:00]  Yes.  The guys.  How are you feeling now?  You're sweating.  I've never seen anyone sweat more.  You were really sweating like you were on trial.  Yeah, you're sweating like crazy.  Well, like I said, it must have felt good.  As it was happening.  Any plans for next season?  Were you close?  Were you close at any point?  Were you like, oh boy, here we go?  Yeah.  Once or twice.  I was a little bit, but...  A little bit.  Yeah.  Are you going to announce your retirement today? 
[03:21:30]  A retiring from the public sex forum.  Or are you going to be like Michael Jordan and try another sport?  Or are you going to get...  Butt plugs and strap-ons.  Or are you going to get Tommy John's jersey on your cockpit?  Tommy John's...  Yeah.  Wow, that's a tough loss.  You feel like you got another...  You got another season in you?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  Now, Big A, honestly, when was the last time you had the company of a woman and came? 
[03:22:00]  How long would you say?  At least four years.  Four years.  Now, you would think you would shoot at the fucking drop of a hat with that one.  You can be honest.  Did you crank it this morning and maybe that's why?  Actually, not at all.  No?  When was the last time you had the last time?  Wow.  I like he's offering no excuses.  He's taking this one.  Yeah, he's really just, no, this is my responsibility.  We went out there to win, but... 
[03:22:30]  I let my teammates down.  My balls, my dick.  They're not even looking at me.  We might have to set them down to the A ball.  AAA?  I said, talk in AAA for you.  I said, yeah, independently.  The Newark Bears.  Independently in Cape Cod.  If you can do it, you got to go buy something or something or do something.  Yeah, you just got to get it over with.  What's up with...  You got to wash a little more.  I think that's obvious.  Yeah, I think the girl was saying something about that.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Huh?  You started off like a... 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, but he had no idea this was going to happen.  I know.  And then you're sweating and stuff.  You don't know.  He didn't match his boxes.  He had no idea he was getting lucky.  Yeah, if you knew that was going to happen, you'd have probably, you know...  We needed a middle reliever.  A middle reliever?  Yeah.  Oh, the other team did.  Yeah.  I thought some of the officiating was in the fourth place.  I think her arm is getting tired.  Yeah, it happens.  The girl with the toothbrush, though, quite the trooper right there the whole time, keeping  his face occupied, keeping a little chin music, as they say. 
[03:23:30]  If that girl's a trooper, the other girl's a first ballot hall of famer.  The other girl's fucking Patton.  She had like the quarterback role.  The girl standing there with the toothbrush.  The other person was like blocking on punts.  They were playing special teams.  They're rubbing his dick.  You know you're a lucky guy?  Yeah, you're real lucky.  Yeah.  You know what, this morning, you woke up this morning, you had no idea he was going to...  Yeah.  Big A, I could never...  There's no fucking way I could lay there with fucking 20 guys that I know standing there  watching you telling me to come. 
[03:24:00]  Come on, man.  You can't take this person on movie, though.  We're just breaking your balls.  It would be like you're filming a porno.  It would be like filming a porno.  You better come.  Is that what's bothering you?  Soon.  What's bothering you, for real?  Yeah.  You're amongst friends.  What's bothering you, for real?  You're amongst friends, Ricky.  Is this the smell of your own crotch hanging in the air?  Reminding you of disappointment?  What's bothering you, Big A?  What's bothering you?  He's going to fucking rip your head off, Bill Burr.  Yeah.  Talk to Jimmy.  Talk to Jimmy.  Well, I know he looks a little hurt.  I'm reading a teleprompter. 
[03:24:30]  I don't think...  I understand.  It's right there.  He can't see it.  No, he doesn't.  No, he doesn't.  He doesn't care about letting us down.  He doesn't...  It's not about coming.  It's not about coming.  We've all not come before.  What's bugging you?  There's something bugging you.  It's not not coming.  Open up, man.  Open up.  Open up to us.  Open up.  You're a safe player.  We've been here for you.  Ron and Fez just used you.  We're here for you.  Yeah.  You open up.  We're your real friends.  Do you feel embarrassed?  Your real friends get you hookers, man.  Okay.  He's being blatantly honest.  He said yes.  Yeah, sure. 
[03:25:00]  You're embarrassed in what way?  That happens.  Little girls, huh?  No.  Well, you...  It's obvious that you're not...  You don't look like you're angry.  You don't look like you're disappointed  because you didn't come.  You look like you're...  You know, you look like...  We've all been embarrassed.  What are you embarrassed by?  Sort of a sweaty malaise.  Okay, that's it.  I'm out.  And Tracy taps out again.  I'm not going to be a part of this shit. 
[03:25:30]  Tracy's done.  Tracy says,  I'm not going to be part of this shit.  It's the bees all over again with Tracy.  All right.  All right, look.  He's yelling and screaming out there.  He's yelling and screaming out there.  Big A, I'm telling you.  I don't know who...  Come on.  You've got to be a porn star  to be able to pull that off.  That's true.  20 guys you know,  and they watch it.  Big A, you can't take that.  You can't take it.  Hold on.  We almost got some out of them.  So you're embarrassed at what?  Just maybe we can help you.  Tracy's screaming out there.  I'm not going to throw my phone. 
[03:26:00]  Somebody's going to get pushed  on the F-Train tracks or something.  Somebody's going to get pushed  on the tracks  and the subway station  or something today.  Hold on.  Big A, what's going on?  I mean, look.  All right, sit down, Jimmy.  Let's talk to Big A.  He just looks like he's on his face.  He's not angry, though.  I don't think Andrew's angry.  I wish we had a curtain  we could pull  so it's just you two talking.  No, it's just people listening.  I mean, it just...  That's all right to be said.  Y'all going to open up that can?  Y'all going to open up a can?  Look at him.  Tracy. 
[03:26:30]  All right, Big A.  Just listen, Tracy.  He's right open up.  Okay.  This is important.  I'm just going to look.  I'm sitting right here.  I think I'm going to go outside  with Tracy.  A, I love you, A.  Look, A, A.  Andrew, make eye contact with me.  Look, I love you.  Yeah, he's basically saying  don't choke him.  No, you know what this is like?  If you need me,  I'm right here  and they're right here.  This is like that old...  The girls haven't left.  The couch is right there  and the girls haven't left, okay?  Yeah, they're ready to go again.  They're ready.  All right, Big A.  Why are you embarrassed? 
[03:27:00]  What's going on?  Talk to Jimmy.  We'll talk to you.  You know Jimmy's...  Jimmy's probably  the most honest person  on the show.  Jimmy admitted  some horrific things.  I mean, you know,  if the girls are listening,  Jimmy admitted that  he only lasted two pumps  the other night, you know.  But I mean more embarrassed  than that,  like revealing open shit.  Yeah.  Like I fucked a tranny  with a bag,  I admitted that,  you know,  accidentally, you know.  Things happen.  I've been humiliated  as part of life.  So you're among friends.  Let's go.  So why are you embarrassed, Big A?  You know Jimmy tells the truth.  You listen to the show. 
[03:27:30]  I mean, I took a shower.  I was clean.  I'm heavy.  I'm fat.  I was nervous and sweating.  And...  Also, it's not easy  coming here  and have everybody know  and I smile, you know.  Oh, boy. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  That wouldn't be easy.  No, it's not an easy thing.  Did you know  there were going to be  girls here today?  Yes.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  So did you shower today  or was it last night?  This morning.  Okay.  Did you scrub down below  and stuff?  Yes.  He's one of those guys?  Yes, I did.  You just sweat a lot.  You got as much of the black  off your body as possible,  right?  Yes.  Like, it's almost like  sometimes if it's just hot  and you're sitting in the seat,  you're not even doing anything.  You just, you sweat. 
[03:28:30]  Your bag sweats.  I mean, I get a little bag  and it sweats.  Yeah.  A little bag.  Apparently, you have big balls.  And big balls  and a big guy  are going to get gamey.  It happens.  I think it's the curse  of having big balls.  You know,  they're a little smellier  and dirtier, right?  It probably wouldn't have been  that bad if it was one-on-one  because of the nervousness  of all these fucking...  Yeah.  Then you wouldn't be  secreting some kind of  nervous, like, smell.  Yeah, that's what happens, too.  You get nervous.  It's going to happen.  You know, just for today,  Big A.  Big A.  Big A.  What do you say, Big A? 
[03:29:00]  Big A is hurt.  No, he's not feeling  very Big A-y.  Big A, I'm telling you,  nobody in that situation...  You know, come on,  there's like 20 guys  you knew watching.  You can't take this one  personal, man.  If you were with those  two girls by yourself...  And I'll be honest,  some of the smell  that people were smelling  might have been  some of my farts.  Dan smelled one of them,  right there.  Yeah.  I was farting the whole time.  Jimmy was great.  I dropped one gasser  and sent Tracy out of the room.  His pants are on,  and it still sticks me.  I really did.  That's great.  You were camouflaging.  I fucking...  I let a few go. 
[03:29:30]  I really did, Big A.  So that could have been  mixed in with everything else.  I don't know how to explain  the girl scrubbing her hand  until she was bleeding.  But, uh...  Until she was bleeding.  I gotta say, though,  the fucking girls were great.  Dennis brought in  the real deal, man.  Dennis brought in  the real deal.  Bunny Ranch  is the fucking shit.  No fucking sitting there  begging,  trying to talk him into shit,  right?  No fucking games.  Just ego.  Two hot chicks.  No bullshit.  Who's the luckiest guy  in the world?  Big A.  Big A.  Big A. 
[03:30:00]  Cat House, HBL.  Let's not forget about that.  It's about 10 o'clock,  I think.  Big A, you're not leaving  the studio until we know  you're okay.  Okay.  Yeah, you're alright, right?  You gonna go on  Rana Fez later on?  And badmouth us?  No.  No, I'll go back to work,  actually.  You gotta go back to work?  Oh, wait, did you work today?  How long did you work for?  How much money did you lose today  by coming in here  and being humiliated?  Two and three hours.  Oh, shit, that's it, then.  There you go.  You got a job where you sit.  Go get my coat.  And sweat.  We gotta pay Big A  for being here.  You got a job where you sit and sweat. 
[03:30:30]  You can't take this one  on the chin, man.  That's what it is.  You're sitting and sweating.  You're anticipating.  Stomach.  He's anticipating  these girls are gonna be here.  Yeah.  So he's a fucking nervous Nelly.  He's a nervous Nelly  when it's just us and Twitchels.  Yeah.  So he's nervous,  so that makes him sweat  because that's what you do  when you're fucking nervous.  You're gonna sweat.  You just gotta shower  a little longer, that's all.  Or just come...  That's easy.  The key is to get here  right after the shower.  That's an easy problem  to take care of.  That's an easy one.  It's not like you're missing a limb  or have discoloration  or anything.  You know, it's something 
[03:31:00]  you can take care of.  Yeah.  It's also, uh...  It's hard when you drive  for a couple hours first.  That's a fucking...  Oh, yeah.  You're sitting on your ball bag  for two or three hours  and they're big balls  to begin with.  Lionel's seat.  By the way,  you're talking to Greg Hughes,  the actor that plays  Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  This is Greg Hughes.  The brother, Brett Hughes.  You know Brett Hughes  is a good guy, you know.  Yeah.  I'm also a good guy  when I'm not doing this shit,  these dick jokes.  Here.  Here, take a 10.  Fucking Opie.  Jesus.  Wow. 
[03:31:30]  Take a 10.  If you only knew, Andrew,  that you did good.  There's 50.  Let me see what else I got.  We're paying you for your time.  Just because you would be  working right now.  I mean, you're coming in here  to be humiliated  and you're losing money.  That's not good.  Cool.  Let's put a smile on his face.  Yeah, here we go.  Just throw money at big A.  Money makes everything better.  That's a 20.  I threw it a bitch 100.  That's the lesson  we teach people today.  Money makes everything better.  You hungry?  I got a salad.  It's a perfect salad with salmon.  I'm not going to eat it. 
[03:32:00]  Do you want it?  Seriously.  It's a guy who's just  collecting money.  He's waking it up.  Yeah, there you go.  Anybody else?  I got this order,  but I didn't eat it.  You should get one of those  big scrub brushes  you used in the 1800s  in the tub.  You just ride it  like a witch.  Like a witch.  A horny witch  discovering her clit  for the first time.  Big A, you're great  for the show.  We want you to leave happy.  Yeah, do we?  We want you  being upset around here.  I think the things  that we talked about today  are correctable. 
[03:32:30]  I think you can correct them.  Oh, absolutely.  And I think  if you had enough times,  enough experience  of 20 people you know  cheering you on to come,  I think eventually  you'll be able to.  Yeah, I was into  watching you get jerked off.  Are you mad at anyone?  No, I'm not.  Okay, all right.  Maybe a little bit  at yourself.  Yes.  You have low self-esteem.  I see that.  Why does he have  low self-esteem?  You're like a big star  with the fans now.  I see you at FA Trials. 
[03:33:00]  Hey, you're pointing  and laughing.  Last Friday, everyone,  big A.  Big A.  You want to be the guy,  though, like,  that's not enough.  It's like you want  to be the guy,  like those girls,  you want to meet  a girl like that,  not under freakish  radio circumstances,  but for real.  Big A.  And have her hold your hand  and want to be with you  for real.  Right, run in slow motion  down the beach  toward each other.  Right.  Powder up the balls  after a shower.  Yeah, powder.  A little powder.  Powder.  A little powder.  A little bump.  I one time  was getting blown  when I was a teenager  and I had powder. 
[03:33:30]  My balls just went a lot  when I drank.  My balls were so awful.  Girl Karen,  she put my dick  in her mouth  and she went,  she fucking,  it looked like,  it looked like fucking  a cake batter  on my bag.  Yeah.  See, big A,  we've all had problems.  Yeah, you got hairy balls.  Yeah, shave them down.  That'll take care  of some of the smell, too.  Shave them down.  A little bit of  talcum powder.  Yeah.  We need something  of talcum powder.  We need the three.  What about the gold bond 
[03:34:00]  and the blue thing?  You get a little  gold bond on there?  You get a little heat.  A little tingle?  Nah, you don't want  heat down there.  Just a little.  You want to keep it  as cool as possible.  Tape one of the  talcum powder bottles  to your inside thigh  and then you have  like a blood pressure pump.  Just pump it  if you're not  feeling fresh.  Yeah.  Here's another thing,  big A.  Yes.  Do you use  those moistened  like aloe wipes  after you take a dump?  Baby wipes.  Baby wipes.  After you take a dump? 
[03:34:30]  You should be baby wipes.  Every time.  Yes, I used  two of them this morning.  Every time.  Right before you come  in studio,  you just go into  the bathroom,  you fucking  ball bag taint.  You ever soak  in a bubble bath?  Big A hole.  Oh, a good soak.  Soak in a bubble bath  would be really nice.  Lots of Mr. Bubble.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This is fucking  what your self-esteem  learned today.  Yeah, that's a rough one.  Yeah, but you could  fix all this.  It's all fixed.  I'm not even joking.  One trip to Dwayne Reed,  Aisle 8. 
[03:35:00]  That's it.  Handfuls of shit  and it's over.  He wants to be the guy,  like, it's not just  about this.  It's like,  you don't want to be  the radio freak.  You want to be the guy  that meets a girl  who for real likes you.  Yeah, right.  Not just talks to you  because we're all  Well, Big A,  let me let you  in on a little reality.  There ain't nobody  getting girls like that  just coming up  and hanging out.  Just ain't gonna happen.  And let's be honest,  at least you're not  sucking cock for money.  Right.  So, you know.  There you go.  See?  Yeah.  You gotta,  I mean,  I think,  who's the real losers  in this?  I mean,  it's the two girls 
[03:35:30]  trying to service you.  Yeah, it's not you.  A little backhanded  compliment that was.  It wasn't.  I'm on his side.  I told him I couldn't  fucking perform  under those circumstances.  at least you can  look yourself in a mirror.  Well,  can they?  You know.  Yeah.  Let's be honest.  Yes, they can.  Certainly.  They can be very proud.  With a lot of cash  in their hands.  He got paid too.  A pile of money.  Yeah.  Wow.  Well,  I'm sorry you feel bad, man.  We wish you feel bad.  Yeah, don't,  don't,  don't.  Nah, you're not,  you're not leaving here  as the,  the,  the,  the goat huge joke. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah.  We will not let that  happen to Big A today.  Don't, uh,  feel bad about it.  You know.  Are you mad at either  one of the girls?  No, no.  Okay.  Not at all.  Okay.  Dude, they don't even  know where they are.  They're all fucked up.  They're on coke.  They're on coke  and meth and shit.  They've been,  they've been doing pot.  Doing the pot.  Yeah.  At least they,  at least you haven't been  touched by an uncle,  you know.  Well.  Not that we know.  We're not.  It would have been 
[03:36:30]  if he didn't.  Might be a nephew somewhere.  Are you gonna be alright?  Everything's okay.  How about,  how about,  how about,  how about,  how about a free dinner  at FH Riley's?  Anytime you want.  Oh.  Anytime you want.  That's right.  You and one friend.  Okay.  Just say you.  Big A.  What day are you closed?  Big A.  I think it's a day.  Show up on a Monday.  A Monday.  It took a lot of balls  doing what you did today.  And that's what he has.  He's got big,  he does have big balls, 
[03:37:00]  man.  Fucking lay there  as goddamn eight freaks  is staring at you.  Big A.  She was shaking him around.  It was like she was,  like petting a basset hound's head.  It's just like.  Big A.  It's the way you grab  the neck of an elderly person.  My brother listens every day.  Brett's listening.  Table for as many people  as you want.  On me.  That's right.  Up to like six.  Wow.  Eight.  No more than six.  Eight-ish.  No more than six.  Six.  All right.  He's for three.  He's a big boy.  He's a big boy.  Your balls account 
[03:37:30]  for three of those people.  I'm being serious.  Now what you're going to do  is the website's  going to go crazy  and they're all going to be like,  ooh, who is Big A  going to invite to a free dinner?  Oh, true.  True.  See, this bit turns into  another bit that turns out  to be nice for everybody.  I have an idea  of what else he could do.  What?  Fucking after FH Riley's  you go up to  Bananas Poughkeepsie  tonight, tomorrow.  You watch a great comedy show.  Good idea.  Get your mind off of it.  Too bad you're not in Poughkeepsie.  I'd invite you to the show  and leave tickets for you  and you can just give me  a credit card number  to pay for him now. 
[03:38:00]  All right.  We're turning him around.  He's smiling a little bit.  Yeah.  I understand the embarrassment.  You're very important  to the show,  very important to the fans.  This is something,  it's like an education  almost you're getting.  Now, obviously,  there are things  that you've got to  kind of take care of.  It's almost like  an intervention  but not as hostile.  And I'm being sincere,  I would never do this  for Stalker Patty.  Oh, fuck her.  She cares about it.  But you,  you're special to us.  Right.  You're special to me.  You treated my brother  very nice at the restaurant. 
[03:38:30]  I see with my own eyes.  You should pour out  that free meal.  You sure don't.  So, you know,  if we were like  Oprah or something like that,  we'd probably have  all kinds of products  that we could give you  right now.  That would have been  a good thing to do  but we didn't know  this was going to happen.  Yeah.  And give you  all these products  that you could take  home with you  and maybe, you know,  use.  We only have yogurt  and you can't  put that on your balls.  Yogurt and that's salmon.  Yes.  Or whatever.  Don't rub the salmon 
[03:39:00]  on your balls.  It was so many suicides.  And if he would just come  then, you know,  he'd walk away  with a skip in his step.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Yeah.  Now you went through  all this  and you didn't even  get to shoot your load.  I'm going to look  at my ass  and jerk off.  It's good.  Believe me, it works.  No, I'm going to  go in the bathroom.  Surprisingly,  it looks very girlish.  We've all done it.  It's not that good.  Very ladylike.  Yeah.  Or young boy.  Either one.  Jimmy, would you like  to show him just to see?  All right.  Piguet, look.  Just surprisingly,  don't be shy.  It's kind of girlish. 
[03:39:30]  Just look at his ass.  You're going to be  very surprised with this.  See?  Tee hee hee hee.  I feel coy  in front of Andy.  Coy?  Coy in front of Andy.  Tee hee hee.  You're a faggot.  All right, look.  I'm not.  Is Tracy leaving?  Tracy's tapped out.  Tracy, we turned it around.  Tracy.  Tracy, we flipped this house.  Tracy, come.  We flipped the house.  Wow.  We turned it around? 
[03:40:00]  You are a fucking ghetto.  Tracy.  Yeah, yeah.  Tracy.  Tracy, we turned it around.  We turned it around.  Everything's cool.  Good stuff.  Everything's cool now.  No, look.  Ask him yourself.  We turned it around.  Everything's cool.  See?  He's smiling.  He's still devastated.  Everything's cool.  Hey, we all the same way.  Do you cry a lot, Andrew?  No.  No, but you want to sometimes.  Oh, all right.  Yes.  He holds all his pain in the corner.  You hold it in.  That's what you got to do.  You got to push that shit down.  Who cries?  Yeah, go read color purple.  No, you don't see it?  I cry.  Go read the color purple. 
[03:40:30]  He holds all his pain right here, right in his forehead.  Bill, you cry?  Huh?  Have you ever cried?  No, that's for fags.  Go read the color purple.  No, of course I've cried.  All right.  Tracy, we've been sharing with Big A some of the awful things that have happened in our  lives that are embarrassing.  You got anything to add or?  Yeah, I know.  It's got to get sprayed out, man.  What does?  I thought you were doing gang signs.  Yeah, doing gang signs.  That's because I was.  Someone texting you, Big A?  You getting texts and stuff from people.  Who was that?  Fucking no filter, Paul? 
[03:41:00]  Not yet, no.  No?  People texting you going, take me to FH Riley's.  See?  That's what they're going to remember now.  Like, wow.  Of Evan, um, uh, um, Snitty.  Oh, okay.  He's begging for a meal already.  All right.  No, no.  You got to whore it out to some fraud.  You got to take the girls.  What about, uh, what about Deb?  Yeah, Deb.  Yeah, how about you?  Yeah, how about you?  Yeah, how about you?  Like Joe Pesci.  It's never a dull moment here.  What about baby girl?  And I love when I come here.  Yes.  You know what happened? 
[03:41:30]  Wait, can we cat this shit off?  Yeah, let's go.  Do you know what happened in here this morning?  Tracy.  This is fucking, I feel like I'm in my oldest son's room.  I feel like I walked in on my oldest son beating off.  Big A, I could dump my yogurt down your pants and make me feel like you came.  That's all right.  Just going for a while.  Wait, you want to, you want to, you can make me feel like you came, like, could, like,  we put some, like, some yogurt on the pants and then maybe you could hold some hair with 
[03:42:00]  blood on one end of it in your, in your fist.  See, these are now back to the regular jokes, right?  Look at that.  And look out there.  Look out there.  Just look out the window.  Look out the window, man.  You was a part of that.  Yeah, you, you were.  No, I could never take that shit from you.  Dude, you were in the pros today, man.  He beat you off for like an hour.  Dude, he was there with me.  You didn't even, you didn't pay a fucking dime for it.  That's right.  Only in your self-esteem.  But so what?  With us in a room, boy!  Dude, he was part of fantasy baseball down in Florida today.  Playing with all the greats.  That shit never even happened to us! 
[03:42:30]  That's right.  Well.  That's never happened to me.  One chick hanging over me and another one just beat me for an hour.  That's never happened to me.  Nah.  We've been in front of 30,000.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  One timer.  One timer.  Boy, he's a jolly good pal.  Boy, he's a jolly. 
[03:43:00]  Well, you're not.  You're all right.  And Big A, you don't even have to worry about it because right now, I don't know what it  was during the whole episode, but right now there's only just short of 600 people  in the pal talk room.  Yeah.  So it's not like anyone really saw anything.  You are the man, boy, boy.  I believe at the point that it was happening, it was probably close to 1,000 people in Pal Talk.  Yeah, what's up, Chase?  I wanted to see one of the chicks put their finger in your asshole past the knuckle. 
[03:43:30]  Past the knuckle.  Wow.  You know what, man, if you go past him, we should have had some butt bees up here, a butt plon.  You would have came like a sprinkler.  Yeah.  A little prostate exam on you.  Oh, what's so bad with Big A's?  We should have had the black mass.  We should have had the gag ball form.  The gag ball.  Yeah, give him a gag ball.  That's what she was doing.  Well.  I'll see you guys later, man.  She's got a little trouble.  All right, Tracy.  Now you got to go.  Now you got to go. 
[03:44:00]  I got to get out of here.  You guys are going to make me fucking crazy every time I'm fucking come see you guys, Jim.  Fucking got guys putting their balls in bags with bees.  It could never just be hanging out and bullshitting, right?  This is crazy.  There's always got to be some shit going on.  You're going crazy every time I'm going to town.  You're going back to court because of us.  I know.  You're going back to court because of us.  I'm choking the bitch.  I'm like, oh my God.  Yeah.  We should have been like, oh, choke me.  And Tracy goes, choke the bitch.  And Tracy jumped right in like, why did I do that? 
[03:44:30]  I could choke a bitch.  Oh my God.  The DA is going to see that moment.  You choked her like asking a kindergarten to recite the ABCs right at him, man.  Hey, that should be part of your community service.  I'm going to say, you know what?  Uh-uh.  You're going to stay away from opening your hand.  I don't want you going back.  Yeah, I know.  That's what's going to happen.  You're a big, they're going to tell you.  Yo, man, you're a big TV star now.  You can't be fucking around like that.  That's the speech you're going to get.  They probably said, you can't be drinking and driving and going on that Opie and Anthony  show.  That Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:45:00]  You're a big fucking TV star.  This is your shot.  We just lumped in with that.  This is what it's going to be.  Let me tell you something, man.  You can't be fucking just jerking off and fucking...  What are you doing?  You're on a fucking top rated TV show.  You're on a hit.  You know how many times this happens to people?  It's so rare and you got it and you're fucking it up by going on that fucking show.  That's what they're going to tell you, bro.  And watching a dude get jerked off.  A guy's getting jerked off.  You're on a hit fucking show for Christ's sake.  You can't on one side ask me to get you into movies and then on the other side, you're 
[03:45:30]  doing this.  That's it.  Christ, you're taking me out of my knees.  You see what happened to Eddie Murphy, right?  That's what it's going to be, man.  It's going to be.  You can't...  You got to help me here.  You got to work with me.  No, man.  You're going to Google?  Oh, bro.  Y'all are family, man.  As long as the door's open, I'm coming back.  All I want...  You got a fucked up family, man.  And we got to live...  Yeah, we are dysfunctional.  I want one story to come up if you Google Tracy Morgan later.  Man.  Rupert has it.  He watched a guy get jerked off today. 
[03:46:00]  I wasn't the only one!  Yeah, but we're not stars.  Well, let's stand up in New York.  We're not stars.  Tracy, here's the difference.  This type of shit helps our careers.  Yeah.  Just say Tracy in a room full of nobodies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You there?  Star of 30 Rock.  No, I read about it the next day in the paper.  Yes.  Star of 30 Rock watches Monstrosity and jerked off.  You're trying out some new stuff, Tracy.  No, fuck.  You're going to do.  You're trying out some new jokes.  Yeah, man.  I pulled out some pubic hair and then...  Dude, last time I saw you at Caroline's, you were pulling out your pubic hair.  Yeah.  Is there more of that tonight? 
[03:46:30]  No, man.  I got some good stuff.  I don't know how to top this shit.  All right.  What's going to happen to the couch?  We throw it out the window.  It's all right.  It's crying.  It's good.  A homeless person might be...  It's taking a rape shower.  Yo, dudes, come see me, man, this weekend.  Yeah, Caroline.  I'll be there tonight.  No doubt.  See you guys later.  I got to figure it out.  And tomorrow...  Oh.  Ah, Jesus, Jimmy.  That's what happened. 
[03:47:00]  You pooed it.  No, no.  Jimmy.  Jimmy did.  Tracy, part of that smell was us.  I was farting over here, and he was farting over there.  Yeah, it was.  I swear to God.  Bradley.  It was.  I cut like three gasters.  You don't want Andrew mad at you.  All right.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Tracy Morgan's got to go.  He's Caroline's all weekend long.  For tickets, 212-757-4100.  I'll be there.  Yeah, I'm doing all Bill Burr's material.  Doing all this shit.  Fuck it.  He's going to do my Philly rant.  I really didn't know that was your Philly bit.  I didn't. 
[03:47:30]  I just...  I don't know.  I didn't know that was your Philly bit.  And this is just in.  If you missed an episode of 30 Rock, which I absolutely love...  As a matter of fact, Tina Fey said that.  She told me that last week we saw my shit like that.  Oh, boy.  NBC.com if you want to watch 30 Rock.  The whole damn show stealing.  It's a great fucking bit.  Yeah, it's cool.  I don't know.  No shit.  Everybody is a great bit, I guess.  Joe Frazier should have the fucking statue.  I heard that shit on TV before.  Somebody talking about Joe Frazier and the Rocky Balboa statue.  I don't like the way you took Bill's bit and now you're making it like you saw it on TV. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  You were at the show, Tracy.  No, wait a minute.  Let me tell you something.  You were at the show.  That TV was a monitor backstage.  You are a great comedian.  You got a lot of good shit, baby.  I'm a big fan of yours, man.  So if I just take one, you shouldn't be upset?  Hey, let me tell you something.  I'm a big fan of yours.  You ain't never heard about me stealing shit.  I noticed.  You're exciting my jokes.  I'm the funnier than everybody on the fucking planet.  Oh, boy.  Joe Rogan.  I'm just fucking around.  Let's do it.  I go through so much shit one day.  I don't got to take nobody's stuff.  I'm a big fan.  Tracy Mencia. 
[03:48:30]  I got to hurt.  Yeah.  Let me see.  All right.  Did you stop flirting?  Yeah.  How long is the dice bit?  We might go home early today.  No, it's 40 minutes.  40?  Jesus.  Oh, that's nice.  All right, Tracy, get out of here.  All right, I'm out.  All right, Tracy.  We don't want to get through.  Bradley, nice meeting you.  We'll see you tonight.  We'll see you tonight, probably.  All right.  Bradley, do one more spray?  That's not helping, dude.  Give it a big.  I know.  You're good, all right?  You're getting better.  All right, eh?  All right, bros.  What do you want? 
[03:49:00]  What do you want to do?  All right, man.  Tracy Morgan.  The grown Tracy Morgan.  Picture with Tracy.  Hey, Tracy.  Yeah, get out.  Get out there, man.  Go get a picture, big guy.  You should get a picture with the girls, too.  And walk out of here proud.  Big A.  With your shoulders up.  Go ahead, big A.  Don't slump, man.  Show that you're proud.  There he goes.  We'll play pose music for you.  Yeah, you're the best.  I got a picture.  Is he gone?  There.  More like it.  Big A.  Stronger than Lysol.  Wow. 
[03:49:30]  That dude sprayed all in here, and the smell still came back.  Bill keeps putting his shirt over his nose.  He'll take care of it, though.  Yeah.  He just needs a little hygiene.  The girl was dry heaving in the bathroom.  That is classic.  Where's Iraq?  Iraq saw that.  Those girls.  That is classic.  They were troopers, man.  Wow.  They were above and beyond.  Troopers.  They're like the soldiers that come out of the foxhole and run right at the enemy.  Oh, yeah.  Congressional Medal of Honor for a whore.  If there was one.  She has carpal tunnel. 
[03:50:00]  Iraq?  Let's talk to Iraq.  Look at that ass, though.  Good Lord.  So you really heard her dry heaving?  Yeah, as soon as we got to the door, she was gagging very heavily.  Wow, is that something.  Yeah.  She said there was black stuff?  Yeah, black stuff all over his hand.  Is it?  Yeah, we do.  All over her hand.  What am I saying?  Like the black stuff, is she...  Should we ask her what the black stuff was?  Yeah, we can ask her what the black stuff was.  Just tell her just to come by herself.  I don't know. 
[03:50:30]  Iraq.  Happy birthday.  She's a sheath.  Thank you.  He has like dress sock lint.  Dress sock lint.  Dress sock lint.  Now, what's your...  Okay, here we go.  So what happened?  Let's be honest here.  Yeah.  What was...  What black stuff was...  I can still smell them.  Yeah.  What black stuff was...  What did it smell like?  Oh, that's romantic.  Oh, I can still smell them.  Look, she's rolling around smelling his dress shirt while he's on the road.  I used that whole bottle of hand sanitizer.  Smell your hand.  I don't want to. 
[03:51:00]  I still don't want to.  Please, just a little.  Get an intern.  Get me an intern right now.  Get an intern.  Intern, let me go.  I know it smells like nothing but...  Well, you never know.  Germ-X.  We'll see if an intern will verify this.  Here he comes.  Oh, look at it.  They run.  They run.  They run.  Wait, we're going to get an intern?  Oh, not this.  They think they're getting a...  All right.  Now, smell...  Smell this hand.  Smell her hand.  She's been washing it for the last hour.  He walked me to the bathroom, and he was there when I was  But I told...  All right, smell it.  I washed it.  Really do it. 
[03:51:30]  Is it clean?  It smells like flowers, yeah.  Yeah, I washed it like 20 times.  Did you hear her dry heaving?  Oh, yeah.  You heard her dry heaving?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Her scarring is psychological now.  Yeah.  There's nothing on the hand anymore.  But you'll still smell.  She'll wake up like a vet.  You know, I will never, ever bite my fingernails again.  I was going to say.  Now, what did you say?  You were saying something about black stuff  being on your hands?  Well, you know, like, you know how the...  No, we don't. 
[03:52:00]  Okay, well, I've seen it.  Like, I had an overweight friend once,  and she always, like, she didn't clean in the creases.  Uh-huh.  And so it'd get, like, little, like, black stuff.  It kind of, like, it reminds me a lot  of when you're cleaning a horse's sheath.  Exactly.  So you ride?  What, you jerk off horses?  No, I used to.  Jerk off horses.  No, I used to own horses, and then we had to lose that.  Yeah, I remember the girls around the stable doing that,  and it was, like, really gross.  Yeah, it's nasty.  Because they'd dig in and pull out, like, beef jerky.  No.  It was really... 
[03:52:30]  You'd get pebbles off the helmet.  What?  But...  Yeah, they would, like, pull in,  because you've got to clean a horse's sheath,  or else they'll get infected in there.  They get rocks and dirt.  You know what I don't understand about that shit?  Yeah.  Horses used to run wild,  so what the fuck did they do back then?  They all died of infected dicks.  Get infected and die.  No, I think that they were using their dicks a lot more.  Horses were using their dicks a lot more back when they were wild, too.  When you, like, corral them up in their own little corral,  what are they using their dicks for?  No, it's also, so it's, like, it's getting all dirted up. 
[03:53:00]  They live longer, though.  Like, the ones who are in the wild will die younger  because they do get infected,  and they do, like, choke on their...  That's why I had a horse that was 26 years old.  You what?  Your horse was 26?  Well, yeah, I had a horse that was 26 when I sold it,  and it lived past that.  You must have cleaned that cock how many times?  A long while.  If you don't race them...  Well, actually, she was an exhibition horse,  so she did all the Spanish exhibition shows.  Wow.  She was a whore.  Yeah, she was a whore.  Ah, dude.  She was a pretty white whore.  Ah, dude.  Ah, dude. 
[03:53:30]  What's your name?  So people want to see you at the ranch, they can see you.  Bunny Love.  Bunny Love.  And your beautiful friend?  Brooke Taylor.  Brooke Taylor.  And you guys are featured on Cat House on HBO, right, girls?  Yes, and the new episode comes out Saturday, tomorrow night.  Sunday, right?  No, tomorrow night, after the boxing match.  After the match.  Saturday night.  Oh.  Okay.  Well, that's cool.  We'll get to watch and go, hey, Sunday?  We saw her.  Saturday night, midnight.  Saturday, Saturday.  Oh, I see what they're doing.  It's Saturday going into Sunday.  Yeah, it says 12-15.  And the Bunny Ranch in Reno, Nevada, I really need to go out there,  because every time you're around Dennis, something fucking dirty happens. 
[03:54:00]  You do, because you don't realize the kind of work I just had to go through.  And if I can put up with that...  Oh, my God, right?  Imagine the things I can do when I'm turned on.  You're fucking Brad Pitt walking in there.  All right, let's be honest with each other.  Everybody is now.  What's the worst thing you've had to do out there?  Today?  Just so we can forget about Big A, what was one of the craziest things you did at the ranch?  The craziest thing?  Or something where you're like, what?  The worst experience that you've had.  Worst experience.  You know, I've never had a bad experience.  I know it's the bloody ranch and everything. 
[03:54:30]  No, no.  Great, but there had to be a guy that wanted to dress up like a chicken or something.  Well, yeah, that's not a bad experience, so I have a blast of that.  All right, give us a strange one.  I have a guy that comes in, and he likes to do different role plays,  and sometimes he'll pretend like I'm his stepdaughter.  Sometimes he'll pretend he's like my manager or whatever, and he's like a weird guy.  But he likes nipple clamps.  The stepdaughter one, though, how old does he want you to be, and how old does he want to be?  Well, the deal was that he's my stepdad, and he found out that I was hooking,  and he wants to be my client so I don't tell a mom, or so he doesn't tell a mom. 
[03:55:00]  I fucking love this guy.  I'm stealing that one.  Jimmy's all fucking, look at him.  He's all plumping up.  How old does he tell you to be?  Does he tell you to talk young?  Well, I'm his daughter, so he doesn't set a specific age.  Like 14, maybe, something like that, but you're assuming he's young.  I was thinking college graduate.  Oh, that's the difference between you and I.  I was thinking the mom was like 80.  So she would be like in her 50s, 34, 34.  Who is it, Jane Fonda from fucking on Golden Pond?  I'm thinking she was awesome.  But he likes me to put nipple clamps on him, and then I tell him to suck my heel. 
[03:55:30]  He sucks my shoe.  Really?  And mints my toes.  And then I, we never have sex, or never like a hand-on-working like that.  Well, that would be sick with his stepdaughter.  But I lay down a towel, and I make him hump the floor.  You make him hump the floor.  And he comes on the floor.  Jesus.  How do you not love this guy?  How do you not love?  Now, he probably has a stepdaughter that he wants to fuck and can't.  And so, you know what?  Well, you know, the other one was, he was Pierre, he was my manager, and I was a girl working 
[03:56:00]  at a fashion runway show.  I don't know if they really pertain to his real life.  This guy is obviously a CEO.  Maybe, yeah.  Absolutely.  He's probably in a position of power on some level.  Let me tell you who it is.  He's a Fortune 500 company.  No, but I wouldn't say that, because he's always kind of in some weird position of power  in the role play.  I bet he's powerless.  I bet he drives a forklift.  All people in role play somehow power.  Like, even when you're a submissive, they're called, you know, topping from the bottom.  Like, you know, you're fucking...  Topping from the bottom.  I mean, you are still in a weird way. 
[03:56:30]  Like, a lot of judges and cops...  I gotta admit you, I gotta tap out at this point.  You're talking shop.  Topping from the bottom.  Is that like shoving your ass onto a cock and go, yeah, I'm fucking your cock.  All right, listen, we gotta get out of here, because we didn't even take a break today,  so they gotta catch up.  God damn it.  So, can we leave with an orgasm or something?  Leave these kids with something to remember?  Cleanse the palate.  Until we're back live on Monday?  Does the toothbrush have enough battery power?  You know what?  The amount of time it took Big A to come, I could have walked to Chicago next week for 
[03:57:00]  my gig of zanies.  Next weekend.  Good fucking plug, Bill.  Thank you.  Wow.  And you could talk about that all...  Tomorrow on my radio show with Joe.  Uninform with Joe DeRosa.  Exactly.  From 9 p.m. to 12.  Lost focus.  But yes, Bill Burr's gonna be doing a show tomorrow night on 10, too.  Come right now.  What's going on, Bill?  9 to 12.  9 to 12.  Doing it out there.  Well, we need a mic.  It's a mic hotter, man.  Guys, this is how we end today.  The line of the day, there were so many that we can't choose one.  Line of the day. 
[03:57:30]  Line of the day.  You're all the big.  Thank you to Dennis and the Bunny Ranch girls, and we fucking love it, man.  And HBO, Cat House, this Saturday night at midnight.  Yes.  After the fight.  Come chat with us at bunnyrash.com.  We have a message board and a live chat.  All right.  So you can all come chat with us, man.  It's free.  All right.  I don't like the way you jerked him off.  Hey.  Just doing angry typing guy from the message board.  Yeah, you get angry people on your message board that have something to complain about?  No.  Every once in a while, like when we do a talk show and stuff like that, somebody will come  on and be like, you guys should be ashamed, but they always get... 
[03:58:00]  You should be ashamed.  But they get bounced, right, because you guys eat your own.  They don't, unless they're really...  Obviously.  Unless their conduct is really not cool, then we boot them, but most of the time they just  get run off by the fans.  Good.  You fucking with fucking...  There's a concept.  You're fucking with sex, man.  Nobody wants to deal with that shit.  Did you hear that?  There's a concept.  Here we go.  Run off by the fans.  Here we go.  Brushing your teeth.  All right.  Here we go.  This is how we end, guys.  Dennis, thank you.  Perfect pussy.  I should be thanking you guys for letting me come.  I love you. 
[03:58:30]  I'm giving you a joke book this Christmas.  Come.  Choker, Daddy.  Oh.  All right.  He's...  Dennis, he'll finish choking.  Fucking come for me.  Will somebody pull me there?  Fucking pussy.  Give me the pussy.  Oh, God.  I'm coming.  Whose pussy is this?  Huh?  Oh.  Huh?  Oh, fuck.  I'm coming.  Technically, it's mine.  It can be, but the price is right.  Oh.  Oh.  Keep coming.  Keep fucking coming.  Oh, fuck.  Huh?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, great.  Think about over-eating your pussy. 
[03:59:00]  Think about...  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't be fucking your dog now.  Think about this.  How did I get that?  Oh, Anthony.  Don't jerk it off in the corner.  You made a laugh.  Very good.  You guys, thank you so much.  Jimmy, Bananas Poughkeepsie tonight and tomorrow.  E-Rock, happy birthday.  I hope you don't make it to your next one.  Thank you, guys.  Oh, thank you.  We'll be back on Monday.  All right, guys.  Peace.  All right.  Thanks.  Where's the promos about us celebrating the female?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Nice, young, fresh vagina.
