<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing their new, significantly larger office. Opie gleefully described his enormous desk, larger than even the boss’s, and his plans for a spiral staircase leading to a second-floor loft.  This sparked a running comedic feud with Anthony, who complained bitterly about his comparatively tiny desk space and the perceived power imbalance.  Crude jokes and pornographic references peppered this discussion, which also involved anecdotes about other office staff, including “Psycho Mark,” and a humorous account of the awkward key exchange with the previous occupant.  Comedian Adam Ferrara was a guest throughout much of this segment, acting as a bemused observer to the escalating office-space conflict.  Ferrara’s appearance also served as an opportunity to discuss his upcoming projects, including a pilot with Dennis Leary.  A listener-call segment promoting a Mets game giveaway was briefly mentioned, followed by the revelation of a debt Anthony owed Opie related to a Caribbean cruise Opie’s girlfriend took without Anthony’s knowledge or consent. The conversation concluded with more banter about Anthony’s day-trading activities.

Following this, Opie recounted a humorous anecdote about a bet at an OTB during the Preakness Stakes.  A caller, Joe, phoned in to discuss his disastrous investment in ECNC,  leading to a conversation about risky investments and pump-and-dump schemes. Both Opie and another caller, Adam, shared their own experiences.  The bulk of the segment then focused on a pre-recorded “Spaz Radio” segment by a caller named Spaz. Spaz’s commentary covered Kate Moss's illness, Bill Cosby's retirement, and was characterized by rambling, nonsensical statements, factual inaccuracies, and bizarre opinions.  This sparked extremely negative reactions from callers who phoned in, using highly offensive language to express their anger and frustration with Spaz. Many suggested violent actions against him. The segment included a commercial for Stacker 2, with suggestive comments from the hosts, and ended with further discussion of the “Most Offensive Song Contest” and a preview of Spaz’s next segment. Adam Ferrara remained a guest in the studio throughout this portion.


The show continued with another “Spaz Radio” segment.  Spaz’s intense hatred of the New York Yankees, opinions on Darryl Strawberry’s struggles, and highly critical political commentary on Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton’s Senate race dominated the segment. He also expressed his disapproval of the Mets playing in Japan.  Numerous listener calls, many mocking Spaz, followed, with callers like “Anthony Hitler” (from Hicksville) and “Dolly Parton” (making a joke about her breasts) contributing to the humorous and offensive commentary.  The segment concluded with the debut of two new songs for the “Most Offensive Song Contest” and the introduction of “Spaz’s Week in Review.”  Later, a 400-pound, 18-year-old listener appeared in-studio, leading to further inappropriate discussions.  The Beastie Boys’ “Sabotage” was played.  Offensive language and jokes targeting race, gender, sexual orientation, and physical appearance were prevalent throughout the entire broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Train Wreck 3  What's that, a train?  What's that, a train?  Oh, that never gets old.  Yeah, it's the O&A Show.  Welcome to this Tuesday.  Who's responsible?  What day are we up to March 28th?  What's wrong here?  Who's responsible for plugging your computer in, your laptop, on my line? 
[00:00:30]  Is it ever plugged in on my line?  Ever.  I'd have to say no.  No.  Am I supposed to use this line?  This is just a cluster app.  Well, soon we don't have to worry about any of that because we have decided something today, Anthony.  In time, this is going to be our studio and all the other shows are going to have to broadcast somewhere else. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  We got the big, huge office yesterday handed to us.  Our boss's office is bigger than any of the boss's offices.  That office rocks, man.  I don't even know what part of the office you're hanging out in.  Have you seen me?  I haven't seen you yet.  I was looking for you on the map, but then I got lost around Ben, and I couldn't find you.  I think I got off the wrong exit.  This office is so big, we have, what, five people that are hanging out in there?  Yeah, five people in the office. 
[00:01:30]  And we pretty much need a telescope to see people.  It's great.  I actually, I called Opie to ask for directions to where his desk was.  Because we had to discuss some stuff.  Yeah.  So I just call up.  Right.  We're in the same office.  I'm over here.  I was using the megaphone.  Oh, there you are.  It was so funny because Pete, Pete's been working for NAW for, I believe, screw Willard Scott.  I think Pete's been working longer than Willard Scott.  Willard Scott celebrated his 50th year with NBC today. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, did he?  Oh, yeah.  I think Pete's, I think.  That's a great thing Willard's doing over there.  Huh?  He's been here 40 years.  Pete's been here 40 years.  And I warned him today that there's going to be some more changes.  Yeah.  For the Opie and Anthony show.  First, I said, get the blueprints out because Ant and I want a spiral staircase that goes to the second story of our office.  Right.  The spiral staircase.  So whoever has the office above us, because we take the ninth and tenth floor on this building,  whoever has the office directly above us is going to have to vacate soon. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah.  Because we're going to get a spiral staircase up to, like, a loft.  And that's where we'll, like, you know, do our movie watching before the show.  You're going to watch me lose my effing mind.  I know.  I can't wait.  Go ahead.  You're going to watch me lose my effing mind.  That's why I'm smiling.  I'm basically stalling because I know you're ready to lose it.  Who?  I got to ask.  Who hooks up that laptop that Opie uses?  I don't know.  Does somebody else use that during the other day parts? 
[00:03:00]  I would assume yes.  Can anyone give me an answer?  So why today, all of a sudden, did someone go, hey, you know, let me pull the wire over  from where Anthony plugs his laptop in and plug Opie's in?  Let me just do that.  That's odd.  Wouldn't you say?  So now you can't plug yours in?  Well, I'm working on it.  We'll see if it works.  I got a little green light here.  That's a good sign.  And you're getting an attitude.  You want too much from this place. 
[00:03:30]  Dude, I'm so heavied up on some of these stocks.  I can't be offline for more than three minutes at a time.  Believe me.  Please trust me on this.  The only radio show in America where we do online trading as we broadcast.  Day trading as we're doing the show.  It's amazing.  You think we're kidding.  We're not.  It's like a bunch of the old jocks.  What did they used to do in the old days?  Pot?  Smoke pot?  Maybe do a little Coke?  Yeah, possibly.  I'm trading. 
[00:04:00]  Please.  I might be okay.  Well, let me look.  And am I getting online?  Okay.  I'll use this wire until tomorrow.  You're online, right?  Yeah.  That wire works.  And soon you won't have to worry about that because this is going to be our studio.  We're going to lock that door.  When we leave here, no one will touch our stuff.  No one will be in here.  Then where are they going to broadcast from?  The other studio?  Wherever else they want.  We have one, two.  We have two other studios.  Each show should get their own studio. 
[00:04:30]  We'd have our own studio.  Now, that's my goal.  That would rock.  We've got the big office.  We want our own studio.  I told Pete to get the blueprints out.  I said, Pete, there's going to be changes around here soon.  We're going to want our own studio.  He was panicking because I don't think he's done anything in 40 years.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  The guy works hard.  I bust on him in the hallway every day.  He knows I'm kidding.  But I did tell him to get the blueprints out because we're ready to expand.  We're going to start blowing walls out. 
[00:05:00]  I was talking about blowing walls out, too.  Like, you know where Earl just got moved?  Yeah.  Earl went from our office.  Which was huge.  Huge.  The huge office.  So we moved in there.  Earl.  No, wait, wait.  I've got to stop you there because it was really funny.  Because the people that were in that office before us had to hand over their keys.  Oh, yeah.  It was very awkward.  Very degrading.  Because, like, I go to Pete.  Pete's in charge of pretty much everything.  Yeah.  As far as that stuff goes, I go, Pete, you know, Aunt and I, Spaz, we all need keys for 
[00:05:30]  the brand-new, big, huge office.  Mm-hmm.  And all of a sudden he had to hunt down the keys, you know, instead of making new keys.  Earl, your keys, sir.  Right.  So Earl had to come into the office with his head down and head over his key desk.  So now Earl is out in between our old office and our new office.  Correct.  Our old office now occupied by Jeremy.  Our new boss.  Yes.  What's that about?  He wanted our old office.  No, I think he wanted to be a little closer to us.  Is that the truth? 
[00:06:00]  I'm a little worried about that.  Well, it's, you know something?  You don't want the boss that close.  He's not much closer than he was before.  You sure?  Yeah.  Well, yeah, he is, I guess.  But we've got that buffer.  That buffer of cubicles that Earl now does his work in.  You know that area?  Yeah.  So now in the future we're planning on blowing the wall out, taking over the area that is  the cubicles, and blowing out the boss's office, which used to be our office, and making  that whole area our office. 
[00:06:30]  And making a, we're going to put a wall in, and we're going to be completely separated  from the entire station.  We're like Hitler in Europe, back in the old days.  We just keep conquering offices.  That's what we're doing.  We're marching.  Goose-stepping our way down the hallways.  That's right.  Taking over the offices.  I like our new office, so I'm very happy with it.  So Pete was panicking, because I'm sitting there telling him, we're going to lose this  wall here.  We're going to need a spiral staircase in the corner to go up to the second story of our  office.  That's going to be a loft.  Yeah.  And then I go, and I go, Pete, be prepared. 
[00:07:00]  You're going to have to rewire this whole station, because Aunt and I are taking over the main  studio soon.  You know what?  I'm a little unhappy with Opie.  You say I'm getting a little out of hand?  A little bit.  Well, I got something to take up with you here about the office.  Okay.  Desk space.  You don't use desks.  Well, let me set the scene for the people at home.  All right.  Opie has this huge, wood, like President Clinton, Oval Office desk in the office.  It's huge.  It was Scotso's old desk.  It's the big desk. 
[00:07:30]  It's the big desk.  We used to have like four people working off this desk.  It was so big.  Now, my desk is a little rolling computer table thing with my computer on it, my huge  monitor that takes up the whole desk.  I have no desk space.  So, I was saying yesterday, I go, perhaps I should have a desk somewhere in a corner of  this huge office.  Opie's like, Aunt, you've got the corner of my desk here.  Yeah, the other side.  No, it's supposed to be our desk.  Right, our desk. 
[00:08:00]  You know what it looks like?  It's my desk.  You ever go to work with your pop to his office and he's working and you set up a chair in  front of his desk, put your little highlights magazine up there and your little Twinkies  so you can have lunch with Dad.  That's pretty much where I'm at here in this situation.  And then you left stuff on the desk and I'm like, no, I can't have this.  He piled my crap up on my little computer sliding table that has no room. 
[00:08:30]  I'm like, this is my desk now.  What, Ben?  It's the first thing.  You're like, get all this stuff off my desk.  And then he tries to tell me, no, it's our desk.  No, it's your desk and I'm intruding on it.  And the problem?  I want my desk.  You can't have my desk.  I want my own.  I don't care about your desk.  I want a little corner of the office to call my own, hang up my own form of pornography.  Sure.  And it's funny because we all have our own pornography.  Everyone's got their own smut. 
[00:09:00]  Everyone's got their own smut that they want hung up by their areas.  But I don't know, I'm thinking somewhere in the corner, maybe by the window, I would like a little desk.  I have my computer thing, which is fine, but there may be something.  I'm not talking about the Oval Office President Clinton Opie desk.  And you understand, though.  What?  For you and I, I'm wheeling and dealing.  I need the big desk.  The big desk.  I sit there, I put my feet on the table, I'm calling.  No, I can see that over the phone.  I'm calling Boston and Washington for us. 
[00:09:30]  I'm wheeling and dealing.  Are you on the phone?  How are you doing?  Yeah, no, right now I've got my feet up on my huge President Clinton desk.  It's great.  It's just like the one he got a Hummer on.  It looks good.  It's the biggest desk ever.  I don't know how they moved it.  And we all know I get in a little earlier than you.  Yeah.  And I'm trying to wheel and deal.  Most of the times.  Wheel and deal.  For us, right?  Right.  So I need to look important.  Behind the big desk.  I'm not saying I am important, but it's good to look like you are important. 
[00:10:00]  Well, you know something, to have a little corner of the desk to put my stuff on so that  you could yell and tell people to move it, it makes me feel a little inadequate.  Well, and I was a little embarrassed because I don't really need your NSYNC CD on my desk.  Look, I'm going to work with Daddy.  Look.  Like, what the hell is an NSYNC CD doing on my desk?  Somebody was being real funny.  That's all I'm saying. 
[00:10:30]  I know.  Somebody thinks it's real funny to send me NSYNC CDs.  Well, let's not forget the DJ Jazzy Jeffs.  DJ Jazzy Jeffs' greatest hits also.  Thank you.  And I'm sitting there wheeling and dealing, you know, salespeople coming in, they can't  see that stuff.  We're supposed to have this cool image.  So I said, get it all on his side.  Great.  Well, I need something of my own desk.  I don't need something.  I don't need the freaking aircraft carrier that is Opie's desk.  You could land planes on the thing. 
[00:11:00]  You know, people could bang broads on half the desk and I wouldn't even notice.  It's that big.  No, you need like an L-shape.  An L-shape desk.  An L-shape computer thing.  You got your computer in front and then the other part of the L around to your left side  would be perfect for you.  Still where I'm sitting?  Yeah.  No, because it's in front of your desk still.  Oh, you need to like take over.  I need my own area.  Okay, I see that.  I can't be in front of your desk looking like the kid that's going to work with his father.  I'll tell you, I know where you're going to end up. 
[00:11:30]  Where?  You're going to have to take over his area.  No, I love Ben Pikes's area.  I got no problem with where Ben is.  I don't want to be there.  I will go by the window.  Keep.  What do you mean?  That's where I am.  I don't know.  Kind of by, um...  Just keep Rick where he is because he's as far away from us as possible.  That's a good idea.  So keep him there.  You're going to have to take over Ben's area.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  He's going to be a little pissed.  I will not do that.  No, I will not do that.  I wouldn't do that.  Well, my desk takes up most of the window space. 
[00:12:00]  Maybe I could saw my desk in half.  The desk space.  You know something?  Oh, but you certainly do not need a desk that big.  You people don't even understand.  We've got to get a picture of this thing and put it on the website.  It is retarded big.  CEOs of IBM don't have desks this big.  I'm going to get one of those big, huge, leather, comfy chairs, too.  Get the big, comfy chair.  With the top of the chair behind you still a foot higher than your head.  A blotter.  Right.  You could, like, get office equipment with, like, golf things on it. 
[00:12:30]  I'm going to get the Ted.  Get your name plate.  I'm going to get the Ted Knight lamp.  Caddyshack.  Sit down, Daddy.  Your desk is ridiculously big.  It doesn't have to be that big.  I don't know why.  It's taking up so much room in that office.  You know what I'm thinking?  We should get little high school desks like that in school where you sit in there  and it's connected, the seat and the desk.  That would make more sense knowing us.  You know?  Yeah.  Whoever sits in this desk before me is an ass. 
[00:13:00]  Whoever sits in this desk in third period's mother is a whore.  Man, I got the solution to the problem.  What?  We're going to have to expand already.  Already we don't have enough room.  We don't have enough room.  The largest office in Manhattan.  We don't have enough room.  If we blow out that wall, you can have your own space.  You ever watch movies where there's the big high-powered executive in Manhattan  and they go into their office, they go into their office,  and it's the hugest office ever?  Yeah.  That's our office.  Yeah. 
[00:13:30]  And we still don't have enough room because it's Opie's desk.  You're on a power trip with that desk.  No, I'm not.  It used to be Scotso's desk, and he needed that room  because he's like banging Yoko Ono on it or something on the weekend.  I don't know what he was doing on that.  But he had like this huge desk, and then it was our desk, and it worked.  It was never our desk.  It was your desk that I got the privilege of having a God-heffing corner on it.  Even in the old office?  Even in the old office.  The old office was set up.  It kind of looked like it was both our desks. 
[00:14:00]  Okay, who had the side where the chair slides under?  Me.  Oh, okay.  I have the side where it's like, oh, my chair doesn't slide under.  Oh, where your knees hit?  Right.  Oh, I never knew that.  No, it only because it's one-sided desk.  I had no clue.  It's not a table.  It's a desk.  They're already using my desk as the lunch table, too.  I'm not happy about that.  Well, they moved the lunch table into the lobby.  Who designed this place?  The lunch table. 
[00:14:30]  A lot of our listeners come by to say hi.  Make sure you take a look at the lunch table next time you're here.  Yeah, it's at the bottom of the stairs in the lobby.  And you know what the funniest part is?  I mean, we used to come in, and the lunch table was in the middle section  between the two offices that we occupy now, and our old one.  And so we would walk past the lunch table every day.  The language that comes off of this lunch table from Psycho Mark alone,  and then you throw in a few other characters and forget about it.  Psycho Mark, the C word is every other word in his vocabulary when he's not on the radio. 
[00:15:00]  While he's eating lunch, right, while he's eating lunch.  Ah, F and C, F and C, ah, I'm biting that F and C.  It's just, like, loud as hell.  Now the table is positioned at the bottom of the staircase that leads up to Wins.  So people that are waiting to get into Wins, whoever it might be,  maybe a politician come down for an interview, maybe a lady's auxiliary.  Who the hell knows?  That waiting in the Wins waiting room?  Yeah.  Here's Psycho Mark chewing on his sandwich, yelling F and C, F and C. 
[00:15:30]  It's a freaking comedy show, this place.  All right.  Well, I guess we've got to expand.  We need more room.  Now we need more room already.  Yeah, I think so.  I'm going to have to look at this office and see if I can fit a little cubbyhole in around Opie's desk.  Get her desk.  That's funny.  But I don't have a computer, though.  Yeah, you do.  I don't have one. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, you're getting one?  Where's that going?  Where's this computer going?  I don't know.  On your desk.  Probably.  Actually, that wasn't even the plan.  See, I don't want everyone to think that I got what I wanted here.  I lost my computer in the move.  How did you lose?  I gained the big desk as mine, officially, but I lost my computer.  Rick stole my computer.  So I don't even have a computer.  So I'm using his because he's gone this week.  Then my private phone is ringing, and I have to run a sprint across this office to answer my phone. 
[00:16:30]  The huge office.  Right.  I have my computer from home.  I didn't even get a computer.  You know, I really don't raid around here.  I wasn't even able to get my own computer.  I had to bring my old piece of crap Packard Bell from home, and there's like car battery  jumper cables that Scott Colombo hooked up, so it works.  All right.  In all fairness, I've got to play devil's advocate here, though.  Okay.  When was the last time you used a computer during work hours for work?  For work? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Well, let me think.  You know, the games often make their way on the air, Opie.  Just asking, because I think management's going to ask that question.  They're going to say, Anthony, do you really need your own computer that the company's going  to have to pay for?  Well, Opie, and I would answer that, as I believe our show prep is just living our lives  and commenting on it on the air and living our lives, in my case, is playing video games  and trading online.  Then, yes, I do need a computer.  Allison thinks that we're turning on each other. 
[00:17:30]  Wait, I've got to get her on the left.  Move the phones now.  Allison, what's up?  I have to love it, man.  First it's open ant against the world, and now you're turning on each other.  I'm like, yes.  Get back to shaving some answers, will you?  All right, Allison, thank you.  All right.  We're turning on each other, huh?  Yeah, it's a power trip now.  Look at this.  It's just like Martin and Lewis.  We're both going for control of the radio show.  Secretly.  You can have it. 
[00:18:00]  I know, really.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Look, everyone, obviously, patiently waiting for Spazz Radio.  Spazz Radio.  We started that late in the show yesterday.  Right after, I mean, right after commercials, we're going to finish up with that, because  there's some great stuff still to come on that.  Where's the Met thing?  We should give away some Met tickets, too.  This coming Monday, opening day at Shea.  Yeah.  And we came up with this nice little concept.  We were going to hang out with, like, a hundred of our listeners at Shea, party, drink beer, 
[00:18:30]  watch the Mets.  And, unfortunately, we're going to be flying back from L.A. on Monday.  Yeah.  We're going to WrestleMania.  Got to thank the McMahon family for personally inviting me.  Yes!  So that should be a lot of fun.  And we're going to have a lot of good stories from our L.A. trip.  Mm-hmm.  So in our place, it's going to be Psycho Mark.  You're going to go with, I don't know, close to a hundred of our listeners.  We're all sitting together.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Yeah.  And with that, I've got to warn you, the tickets are okay. 
[00:19:00]  They're not the worst seats in the house, but they're not the best, if you know what  I'm saying.  Yeah.  Because it was tough to get a hundred seats together to do this little concept where  we wanted to hang, you know, as a group.  All right?  Yeah.  So with that said, how many do you want to give away, by the way?  Two sets of four?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll do two sets of four.  We've got to thank the fine people of smallworld.com, Anthony.  Yes.  Thank you.  It's a fantasy baseball website, and they donated the tickets so we can do this, okay?  Cool.  And you can win great prizes, including the All-Star Game in Atlanta and the World Series, 
[00:19:30]  just by checking out smallworld.com.  But let's give away two packs of four to the 10th and 11th callers right now at 212-757-1027.  Quick break, and we'll come back with Spaz Radio.  Stay there.  Hi.  Hey, this is Louis Black from The Daily Show, and you're listening to two of the most psychotic  human beings I've ever met.  My Pals, Opie and Anthony on 102.7 WNEW.  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  Booty-dooty.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell. 
[00:20:00]  Opie and Anthony on 102.7 WNEW.  Look who stopped by the old radio show, Anthony.  You never know who's popping by.  Do I get the hug?  It's my pal.  It's my pal.  Sure.  Sure.  Adam Ferrara.  Comedian extraordinaire.  Actor.  Water filtration device salesman.  You've got to bring that up every time.  Everyone has a past.  Everyone has a past.  Now, Adam. 
[00:20:30]  The name is King Gimp.  Oh, the King Gimp.  We discussed that for like a half hour yesterday.  You had to.  You had to.  I was so mad I couldn't get here yesterday.  The King Gimp from the Oscars.  I'm going to miss the King Gimp out.  King Gimp.  Yeah, you know why he's King.  That guy was great.  Let me follow you and learn your ways.  King Gimp.  What brings you to the fine city of New York from your native Los Angeles?  I miss you and I hate when you say that.  Yeah, I know.  You're from New York.  I know that.  You know that too.  Yes, I do. 
[00:21:00]  You know, Adam's known you for a long time, Anthony.  I'm going to ask him.  Okay.  There's a power struggle going on here.  Ann and I both trying to take control of the radio show.  Right.  We've been working together for...  I was smelling the urine in the hole.  Somebody's walking their territory.  We've been working together for close to six years now.  Wow.  We think the other person's trying to take control of the show now.  Right.  Feeling a little bit.  You know, that's how it starts.  Then one of you marries an Asian artist named Yoko.  And it's all over. 
[00:21:30]  Breaks up the band.  Welcome to the Opie Radio Hour.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  So we moved into a bigger office, Adam.  Well, look at you.  Oh, wait until you see our office.  We now have the biggest office in this whole place.  Right.  Bigger than the boss's office.  No more Anne Frank suite?  No, not at all.  Very big, and half of it's taken up by Opie's desk.  Oh, there it is.  So, aha. 
[00:22:00]  So, aha.  Opie has the huge aircraft carrier Nimitz desk in the office.  Meanwhile...  That's this.  Hit the wire.  Hit the wire.  Meanwhile, I have...  Remember the desk that you took your SATs on?  Oh, that little David Copperfield...  It's not even a full desk.  You sit in the chair and the little desk part flaps down.  You're in a...  That's it.  You're in a keynote chair.  Yeah.  A keynote chair.  So, and you know where my little chair is positioned? 
[00:22:30]  I'm in front of my computer, which takes up most of the little desk area I have.  But they put me in front of Opie's desk.  Oh, so you're facing him?  Like when you go to work with Daddy, and they set the chair up by the desk so you can  eat your twinkies and watch Daddy work.  That's where I am.  I'm in front of Daddy's desk.  Now, you have to be quiet, Anthony.  Opie's on the phone.  Yeah, yes.  So, basically...  Use the big boy voice when you're in Daddy's office.  And, Adam, you know...  You're on the card table in the hallway. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  With a fruit cup.  What I was trying to explain to Ant, I get in early, and I'm wheeling and dealing for  Ant and I.  I'm making phone calls, talking to salespeople.  I need to look in port.  So, I put my feet up on my big, huge desk, and I'm taking calls.  I didn't see, like, go-hegs Adams with the ticket tape.  Sell, sell, sell.  But send by.  Now, the question, Adam, I have for you.  You've known Anthony for a very long time.  Does Anthony need a desk at all?  Um, well, he...  The truth is, he doesn't, but he's sitting right in here. 
[00:23:30]  I need a work surface.  A work surface.  Regardless of what I need it for.  You never cleaned off the coffee table in the apartment for guys.  Yeah, these guys live together.  If anything but beer cans, I need space.  I need flat surfaces to put stuff on.  All right, I'll tell you what.  I've seen what happens when he doesn't get his way.  So, give him the desk.  I understand that, yes.  You know?  Oh, man, come on.  When he gets mad at you, like, he just keeps picking at a wound, like, say, hospitaliano. 
[00:24:00]  The best part is, we moved into the new office, and the big desk, you know, followed us.  And I said, no, and of course, it'll just be, like, the old office.  We'll share the big desk, you know?  And I decided on the train this morning that, uh-uh, I'm going to the desk.  So, I come in around, whatever, 10.30 or so, and so the stuff is on the big desk.  I'm like, I can't have this.  So, I made them remove it and put it on his keyboard, on his little computer.  It's, like, dumped on my computer.  I'm like, what?  I stopped. 
[00:24:30]  And he says, oh, we're sharing the desk.  It's not a table.  It's a desk.  So, the chair only rolls under on one side.  Yeah, yeah.  I try to roll under.  My knees hit.  Give me a, this isn't my desk.  I'm like an intruder.  Get one of those partner desks with the big line in the middle.  Oh, partner desks.  You're a gate in this van.  Partner desk.  Get it.  What do you want?  Partner desk.  Hey, Opie, you want a partner desk?  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, we got a new template.  Hey. 
[00:25:00]  It's been a while.  I finally got control of the hey.  Hey.  I know.  He took control of the hey.  I used to do the hey for the show.  Hey.  Hey.  One of you gets the hey.  Hey.  Hey.  One of you gets the hey.  Is that fair?  Don't make me separate you two.  I'm telling you, there's a power struggle going on.  If I separate you, it'll sound like Lycus, and we can't have that right.  I used to control the hey, Anthony.  What's that about?  Why do you need to control the hey, guy?  I said from the beginning, when Marco first said hey, I need that on my instant replay machine.  Yeah.  And you took it and put it on the machine that I think, all of a sudden, when Opie wants 
[00:25:30]  to play this, see, look what I have to do to play the hey.  Right.  Finger, push button.  Hey.  There it is.  Hey.  Hey.  Opie had to hook up like an old operator at an old switchboard in the 1900s just to  get the hey work.  Get me Murray Hill 6, 664.  Yeah.  That was pretty much what he had to do.  Oh, boy.  Were we at each other's throats today.  I walked in.  I saw it.  It's like a bitch fence.  We're both on the reg.  I know.  I was looking at the calendar.  The numbers were doing. 
[00:26:00]  I was a little bloated dance.  It's pampering day here.  Oh, funny.  I don't know.  I don't.  You're right, though.  I really don't need a desk the size of President Clinton's Oval Office desk that all passes.  It's great, though.  But something.  Look at you.  This is my shuffleboard on this thing.  You're good.  It's amazing.  I just need something on the side of my computer desk where I could put beer cans.  I'll say it again.  I think we have to go to the boss and tell him we need to expand already. 
[00:26:30]  We might need a bigger office already.  Already.  Okay.  I've got to see it now.  Oh, we've got to tell you the other thing?  You haven't been here in a while.  No, I haven't.  We're going to the bosses tomorrow, and we're demanding that NEW is called the Opie and Anthony Station.  Opie and Anthony Station.  We just keep asking for ridiculous things.  And they keep giving it to us.  They keep giving it to us.  We like to get paid in cougar ends.  No, no, because the money thing is what they won't give us.  Oh, they won't?  No. 
[00:27:00]  So it's funny.  They give us everything else.  So now we want to be called the Opie and Anthony Station.  Yeah.  N-E-W.  Opie and Anthony Station.  Yeah.  Just something.  Have some bumpers made up.  And I think they're going to go for it.  How stupid is this?  What else can we ask for?  Get a Fabergé egg.  See if you can get one of them.  All right.  Now, what brings my pal back to New York?  I'm working.  I'm working.  You are?  I'm at the...  Are you doing that thing?  That thing?  That thing?  Not the other thing that we were talking about. 
[00:27:30]  The thing.  We did the other thing.  It's the other thing with the guy.  The other thing with the guy.  That guy.  I got to do the thing with the guy.  All right.  Sure.  I understand.  Very exciting, too.  Not the thing with the guy.  It's very good.  The exciting thing with the guy.  Can we talk about it?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  It's just fun to do it this way.  I know.  Did you get the shirt?  Did you get the bullets for the shirt?  So, you're taping a pilot?  A pilot for ABC with Dennis Leary.  Dennis Leary.  Look at that.  A real name. 
[00:28:00]  Not the Hospitaliano.  Not Hospitaliano.  You're not a Hawkins salad.  There's no product involved in this.  Where will mozzarella sticks come into play in this pilot taping?  Is there a breadstick anywhere around the set?  Is it fresh?  And can you bring the family?  How do you feel in your head?  Do you feel like family?  Do you feel like family?  Now they got some bread doing that.  You see that?  No, I didn't see that.  It's the same lighting that gives you that Damien from the Omen eyes.  You see that kneeling down at the casket lighting? 
[00:28:30]  I say we go with Geisha.  Did you see that?  I look like a carton of milk.  Not only that, but everybody I know, especially like my sister Dawn, my mom, they know you,  love you.  Right, right, right.  I said, did he wash his friggin' hair?  I mean, do you have to do an Italian restaurant commercial looking like a greasy Dago?  Your hair was, what was up with that?  What do I know?  I went at the hair maker.  Adam, olive oil in the hair.  All right.  All right.  What else, Mr. Desk? 
[00:29:00]  What are the problems?  You know, then you wonder why I stay alone for so long.  You know something?  When finally this pilot is picked up and you are on national network television in a successful  series, I'm knocking wood for you and I have faith like no one else, the hospitality on  a thing will go away.  Thank you.  But I am just working on what I last saw.  And you'll find something else to break my balls in my mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's what friends are all about.  The line bumping.  I'm afraid when they air that list thing I did for VH1, I'm like, oh, I'm going to get 
[00:29:30]  reamed for that.  Oh, yeah.  You did the list.  With George Clinton's nuts.  Yeah.  He's like hysterical nuts.  He's that black guy.  Yeah.  Parliament Funkin' Hell.  He's the black guy.  Did you smoke weed with him or something?  No, but I got a contact high in the mail.  Who else is on there?  Yeah.  When's that airing, man?  I have no idea when it's airing.  Who is it?  Biff Naked.  A police singer named Biff Naked.  Biff Naked.  She was cool.  And the girl from, what was her name, from Starship Troopers?  The blonde girl?  Oh, the blonde girl.  Oh, yeah.  I thought you meant the other one.  No, no. 
[00:30:00]  She was beautiful.  Yeah.  And Michael Bunga.  Yeah, sure.  Just like that.  I got a girl for now.  Girls, come on to me.  You're funny.  Thanks.  I got to go slam my genitals in the drawer now.  I'll be fine.  I remember you used to work the crowd there at those comedy clubs early in your career.  What do you think?  You do it for the pay?  Like at Eastside Comedy Club out on Long Island and stuff?  Adam Hotshot, you know, young comic, gets out there, kills the room.  Just kills them.  They're dying laughing.  Comes out.  The guy's making like five bucks the whole gig. 
[00:30:30]  Five pesos.  And I'm like, you know, he's got to work his way up, you know, kind of feeling bad because  he's very talented.  He's killing the room, like I said, and not getting paid.  All of a sudden, he walks out by the bar area to a harem.  These girls are just coming up.  You're funny.  You know something?  When you said, hey, thank you.  Oh, we're going to start, Mr. Lead Singer of As Is?  Get out of here.  You want to get started with those stories?  Get out of here.  Shut up.  You know, I wrote that song. 
[00:31:00]  Really?  I can feel your pain, Mr. Singer, man.  Yeah, sure.  He used to play the whole disassociated artist thing.  He'd finish a game.  I just didn't want to clean up the equipment.  You were in a band called As Is?  Oh, please.  Many years ago.  Do you have tapes of this, Ed?  I do.  Do you really?  Oh, I do.  Could you bring them in next time?  Oh, I'm going to.  All right.  Oh, I'm going to.  You bring those in.  Those are only audio tapes.  I have video of you that I'll put on a website that will get hit by millions of people.  You know the hate I have for it right now.  What kind of video do you have in? 
[00:31:30]  I've been electronically trumped.  Yeah.  What do you have?  You got me some e-side tapes?  I got some stuff where, you know, you were a brilliant comic.  Hold on, smartass.  I have RDTV tapes, Mr. Chef Resin.  Ha ha.  All right.  What's that about?  We did local cable access thing.  Yeah, yeah.  And we did this little TV show with me and Anthony.  It was a cooking show with a stone guy.  Yeah, he was the stone guy.  It was typecasting.  You've got to bring some of this stuff.  Boy, it is. 
[00:32:00]  It'll be like a war.  Media war.  You're lucky it's radio, and he couldn't see you turn white.  You suck, man.  All right, forget it.  All right, none of it.  It's like an arms race over there.  It really is.  Pakistan and India.  It's like when you're in a street, and you're just ranking each other out.  No mothers, man.  Pulling out the old Betamax tapes with dust on them.  All right.  You hanging or what?  Yeah, I'll hang for another break.  Oh, what?  What are you just stopping in? 
[00:32:30]  I came in to say hello.  Usually, what are you taking today or something?  I actually have to be, I have to be, yeah.  Oh, really?  Forgive me for getting a job.  Yeah, really.  Come on.  I stopped on the way else.  And his attitude's changing already.  I see.  Look at this.  All right, go hang out with Leary.  Go hang out with your new friends.  I don't want him talking directly to me.  Can we put up with something where he doesn't have to look at me?  I guess that's a little more important.  Dennis Leary.  Yeah.  More than us.  Instead of your pals.  Remember?  Oh, yeah.  I know.  It's who you get. 
[00:33:00]  I can be here for love.  I can have for money.  So you think you can get him on the show for us, maybe?  Sure.  At the point when you guys are really pushing this thing?  You keep threatening at that video.  All right.  And if you're curious as to what it is, it's Adam doing some hysterical comedy commentary  on the Gilligan's Island boat.  Oh.  You know, like any hack comic of the 80s would.  Yeah.  Come on.  Wait a minute.  Who helped me write that?  Oh, yeah.  You.  All right. 
[00:33:30]  Getting ugly in here.  What?  Are we all on the rig?  I remember the advice.  Run your fingers through your hair like Richard Lewis.  They do that a lot.  He didn't tell you to do that to me.  That's what he told me to do.  Run your fingers through your hair.  I don't think I said that.  I think you did.  Sweat like Louie Anderson.  Show me, brother.  Oh, he's hysterical.  Oh, yeah.  He's a weasel.  Oh, a laugh riot.  He's just watching him.  I'm waiting for him to explode.  I know.  Have a heart attack.  You know what it reminds me of? 
[00:34:00]  You remember Willy Wonka in Baruca when she ate the blueberry?  Yeah.  And she got all blue in it.  We have to juice her.  The Oompa Loompas had to roll her out.  I'm just waiting for the stage just to roll them out.  We have to juice him.  All right.  Let's take a quick break.  Yes.  Maybe Adam can hang out for a couple of minutes.  Show me office wear.  Ding.  Jeez.  Much too important.  I have to make sure my trailer is just so.  That's right.  I'm much too important to be captured.  You're stupid, good-looking.  Opie and Anthony.  Once, ladies and gentlemen, you guys are really funny and stuff. 
[00:34:30]  But you guys take it too far to the point where I literally get nauseous and sick listening to your radio show.  Go take a mitle.  The Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street of Little Italy, huh?  We love Paisano.  We're there all the time.  Love the food, the atmosphere.  And you ask for Joey.  He's the owner down there.  You get a free glass of wine with your meal.  Good place to take the family. 
[00:35:00]  They have real Hospitaliano down there.  Not that plastic Hospitaliano that Adam was selling.  I'll be live because I want to call you a prick.  Are we live?  Sure.  Yeah, we're live.  Duty head.  Duty head.  Yes.  Paisano.  Like I said, Adam, you want free food tonight or what?  Sure.  Huge.  Huge portions.  I better go down there.  Go down there.  That's real Italian food.  Mm-hmm.  In Little Italy.  Mm-hmm.  From, it says here, look at this. 
[00:35:30]  Authentic Old World Italian Recipes.  Nice.  They brought him over on the ships.  Joey himself.  I'll have the Ellis Island Linguini.  Yeah.  Brought with the family.  Romance of Italy.  Warm, friendly, relaxed restaurant.  Mm-hmm.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Well, don't forget to tell him, too, Ant.  You see Joey.  You tell him Opie and Anthony sent you.  And what happens?  I heard you get a free glass of wine.  Oh, very good, Adam.  Very good.  Adam listens to the radio show.  It's Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy. 
[00:36:00]  Give them a call.  965-1188.  That's 965-1188.  Opie and Anthony.  You guys in conflict.  Piss me off, okay?  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Yes, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  Our phone number, 2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We did not forget about Spaz Radio.  You know, Adam Ferrara dropped in, so, you know, you've got to talk to my pal. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, we're delaying Spaz Radio.  Adam's with us for another 20 minutes or so, and then we'll get into Spaz Radio.  Well, can you hang out?  I saw you on the phone.  He's on the cell phone during commercials.  Oh, this isn't the guy that was trying to sell me water filtration system back in the 80s.  You know, I'm on his cell phone all of a sudden.  Oh, he's so arrogant.  Why, because I'm not yelling out the window?  Yo, Paulie, your sister's with me.  I'll call you later.  It's a cell phone.  I know, I'm just saying, like, you're ordering imported wine. 
[00:37:00]  You're making deals.  Look at you.  Whoever knew I'd see this.  When we were hanging out there in Green Lawn.  Wait, time out.  Adam, your buddy Anthony has a cell phone now, too.  Yeah, I know.  You know?  I'm not.  Oh, and during commercials, I make deals.  Bah!  I'm doing that on computer.  I know.  He's on the computer trading stocks.  He's got an IRA.  Adam, I'll tell you one thing.  You must be important in his life, because he's blown off the day trading to hang out and 
[00:37:30]  focus on what you have to say today.  Really?  Look at him.  All my stuff's down.  I can't sell nothing today.  That's why.  Stocks.  Come on.  Damn NASDAQ.  Some bitch had to say something.  Instead of some brokerage firm, and it screwed up the whole NASDAQ today.  What happened?  She said, oh, I'm removing some stocks from my portfolios.  Right.  You know, I'm going to put them in cash.  What do you want to do?  So then what?  Everyone pulls out, puts their money under a mattress for a week, and then puts it back  in.  Hmm?  Yeah, leave it there.  That's what the stock market does. 
[00:38:00]  You know what I like?  I bought him beer for five years.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what, do you want that money back?  I remember this.  This isn't a tall boy.  And like a schmuck, I go back.  And I get the tall boys.  Yeah.  The lean years.  The lean years.  Adam, I owe them 600 bucks.  You do?  Yeah.  Oh, you heard about that, right?  I was going to take it out of your desk.  You heard about that.  No, what happened?  This is classic.  Let me hear you.  This is classic.  I can't go into too many details because of pending litigation. 
[00:38:30]  Right?  That sounds like you.  Yeah.  I would get those calls like, hey, pal, how you doing?  You got $1,500?  I really can't tell you.  But I need it.  I never borrowed money from you.  No, you took it, you baby.  So, go ahead.  What's the story?  I don't feel as bad.  No, I'm really kidding.  Well, Opie's girlfriend, Sandy.  Oh, is this the cruise?  Yeah.  Oh, you heard the cruise story.  Very good friends.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  With Jennifer.  Right.  All of a sudden, Jen decides to take Sandy on a cruise.  Right.  Down to the Caribbean.  Mm-hmm.  That doesn't sound like a bad idea.  Right.  Until it's being paid for on Anthony's American Express card.  Ah.  And Sandy went.  Mm-hmm.  You know, I mean, that's all fine and well, but...  I need to clear my name.  I had no idea what they were scheming behind the scenes, Sandy.  So, how long have you known she went on this cruise?  A little longer than you knew.  Okay. 
[00:39:30]  So, we're talking months now.  Right.  Yeah.  And how much have you compensated me for the cruise that Sandy went on?  That would be...  None money.  That would be zero, sir.  None more money.  But why should I pay?  It was someone else's idea.  It had nothing to do with this idea.  If the situation was reversed...  Yeah.  It wouldn't even be a lapse.  I would have written a check...  Mm-hmm.  ...and paid you the money.  I'm going to have to sell my big desk, I think.  Yeah.  Sell your big desk. 
[00:40:00]  And then...  And he checks his stocks on a daily basis, too.  Right.  And he's like, oh, I'm doing good today.  Oh, I'm doing good.  Oh, but occasionally you've got to sell these things.  I know.  I'm a long-term type of guy.  But if I need to pay you, I'll sell a few shares.  We've got $75 laying around.  Laying around me a bag of shelves.  I want the boat with two propellers.  Okay, so do you want me to pay you by the end of the week?  Wait a minute.  Why isn't Sandy paid? 
[00:40:30]  That's best left for Opie to explain.  Really?  Opie?  I yield to the man behind the big desk.  I don't think Opie's going to tell unless he wants them to go on another cruise on him.  Oh, okay.  Let's just put it this way.  If Sandy pays, she'll be writing the check from the bank of Opie.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  I got it.  Yeah.  Now she's going to call up and scream. 
[00:41:00]  Thanks.  Like, I need this today.  What?  I'm just saying.  You know, you said that you were going to pay.  All right.  Let's...  Let's...  The cruise.  When would you like this check?  I'm not putting any deadline on this.  You pay when you feel...  Oh, no.  You need...  You know me.  I know.  You know me.  You need to put a deadline on this.  Opie needs structure.  I need structure, like the big desk in my own organized area.  I need to know...  He needs boundaries.  ...when I need to bring in my checkbook.  Because you know me.  I'm just being honest.  You know me.  If you leave it up to me, I'm just going to delay. 
[00:41:30]  All right.  Okay.  Let's set a day.  I'll tell you what you do.  I'll do it live on the air.  I'll write the check so you can hear me cry.  Let me tell you about that.  It had nothing to do with this trip.  I know.  I know.  See, now, I'm feeling a little guilty about that.  You know, it wasn't really open.  I'll tell you what we do.  It goes away like that.  I'll make a deal.  Adam, I did find out.  And I'm, like, panicking.  I'm like, oh, my God.  And I'm just praying he didn't find out because they got a pretty good bargain on this cruise.  I'm like, if he looks at the number, maybe he just assumes it's one trip.  How do you find out there's two trips? 
[00:42:00]  I called my Amex, wondering why the hell so much money was being charged on it.  Right.  And, uh, Adam, he told me.  We don't keep anything from each other.  This time I did, though.  I'm just, I'm, like, freaking panicking.  I'm like, no.  This is like when Archie kissed the waitress.  I'll tell you what I'm going to do.  You don't love me no more.  All right.  Here's what I'm going to do.  What would you like?  Uh, you give me the money.  Okay.  I will instantly invest it in some high-risk crap.  If I can double it, I will pay you back. 
[00:42:30]  And I know I'll double it.  I will take that.  I will.  And with that, I am bringing in my checkbook tomorrow.  And I will invest it.  I have within two days.  Two days?  What do you think I'm dealing with?  Come on.  I will either lose it all or I will double it.  That's great.  I'll do that.  Because I kind of feel bad that, yes, you know, you didn't go on this cruise.  And you didn't know about it when it was happening.  You have to learn how to curb your squeeze. 
[00:43:00]  Curve your squeeze.  My God.  Jesus.  I'm paying for a cruise I didn't even get laid.  See?  Yeah, see?  So, and you didn't know until after the fact.  So, you know, I, so I'll do that.  I apologize for knowing and not bringing it to your attention.  You have sinned by silence.  Invested in some very high risk stuff.  He's going to go to an Indian casino.  And what time tomorrow would you like me to write the check?  Tomorrow. 
[00:43:30]  If you're going to do this for me.  That's good because that will give me the rest of the week to pop it up.  I want to see you, I want to see you double the money.  I will, I will sign the check at 245 tomorrow.  I want to see if you can double it before seven.  Okay.  Kind of risky.  I know that's, all right.  Adam, I've seen him work.  Sure.  This is good stuff.  You should see what I pulled off in Disney.  Oh, my God.  Really?  Oh, it was ridiculous.  It was retarded.  It was retarded.  I go on vacation, you know, to Disney. 
[00:44:00]  And 9.30 in the morning, I'm up.  I'm logged on.  I got the Disney TV over there.  It's tuned right into CNBC, watching Squawk Box.  Right.  I start trading.  Mm-hmm.  Danny.  Oh, Danny.  Sit down, Danny.  That was pretty good.  You pretty much paid for your vacations, didn't you?  And the cruise.  And the cruise.  It was really, it was a good day.  I just figured out how to, like, download pictures. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, I swear to God.  This guy is technologically inept.  I know.  He has been for years.  You just got an email address, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's like, what's your email address?  And I give him the email address on the website.  He goes, can I email you there at the Foundry Music?  No.  See, that's Foundry Music's the website where we put up pictures and videos from the radio show.  My email address is something different.  And this is a wheel.  I turn on my computer.  And don't touch the fire.  It'll burn you.  I turn on my computer.  A little man comes on and just gives me the finger. 
[00:45:00]  He just says, you know, sit down.  And this from a guy who probably bought one of the first laptops ever invented.  Remember that thing?  Oh, the way.  You big fan.  He bought this laptop.  I swear, it was 1988.  It ran on Steam.  87 or something like that.  It was as big as my desk.  It was like those old VCRs that would pop at the top with the remote at the line.  Top load.  Top load.  You had to slam it down.  Remember that?  It was ridiculous.  And it had a monochrome monitor.  There you go.  Monochrome.  No color.  Black and white monitor on this thing. 
[00:45:30]  Amber.  It was huge.  It was like yellow or something.  Yeah.  It was horrendous.  It was disgusting orange.  And he would use it to write, I guess, because there wasn't any graphics happening.  We didn't know how to do anything else.  There was no online.  There was no nothing.  You would have wasted.  You're pissed.  You're like, what kind did you get?  I'm like, it's a white one.  See it?  Come on over.  What kind?  What's your processor screen?  Meanwhile, he takes a computer chip out of an Atari game.  He's got an AP wire to the house.  I've seen this.  I've seen it work, man. 
[00:46:00]  Did you see him do that?  I've been very up on the internet for many years.  You've got to show me how to do this investing stuff.  Oh, boy.  You don't want to get...  No, no, no, no.  You know what?  Let's see how the series goes.  Oh, stop.  Let's see if the pilot gets picked up.  Come on.  And then you worry about how to throw your money away.  Let's start with downloading a JPEG.  I got that.  I can do it.  Let me tell you something.  And this goes out to anybody who wants to get into online investing.  Right, right, right.  Your first year is spent losing money and feeling very bad about it until you learn from your mistakes. 
[00:46:30]  That's it.  Yeah.  It happens.  Okay.  And then you start working it.  The only thing is, the first year, thank God, you don't have the balls to pump a lot of money into it.  Okay.  You cannot possibly be the same guy I met seven years ago.  That's all I've got to say.  Why?  If the people only know.  People have come a long way.  He's like Gordon Gekko, man.  It's unbelievable.  He really is.  He's like in a three-piece suit on a treadmill in a hot mine. 
[00:47:00]  Remember at BAB, I used to come in, it was like nine o'clock, I was drunk.  I was like, oh, he's drunk again.  Nine o'clock at night, I was at the bar after work.  My life is hell.  Come on.  I remember, Ray.  I remember rum and laundry.  Yeah.  You used to do the laundry.  You had to go to the laundromat over in Green Lawn.  That was next to the bar.  And load the clothes in the washing machine.  There were times I would let the clothes run through a second cycle.  I'd go over and pump more quarters in because I needed to drink more. 
[00:47:30]  They're like, oh, they're not quite clean yet.  Hey, more Bacardi and Cokes, please.  Adam, help me fold.  Listen, I don't know how to fluff.  What part is that?  I ain't no fluff girl.  And now he's a day-trading whiz.  Why?  Come on.  I was always into gambling.  You know what?  Gamble.  Oh, come on.  This is Wall Street, my friend.  Yeah, you can do that.  This isn't the craps table.  You can gift wrap a rock.  You still got a rock.  Oh, I got a wedding story. 
[00:48:00]  What did we do after your wedding?  After you got married on the green shag rug in Port Jeff's.  In the guy's house.  In the guy's house?  He was in some guy's living room on a green shag rug, and his wife is watching Barnaby Jones  in the other room, and we had to keep it down.  And he's getting married.  So he gets married, and then the whole wedding...  Goes off to a great start.  Yeah, that's where it began.  The whole wedding procession, which consists of my car and two air conditioning trucks...  That shouldn't have been on the road.  That shouldn't have been on the road. 
[00:48:30]  All right.  I had to stop at OTB to bet the preakness.  Yes.  There's the reception.  You're right.  Give me two across the board.  We wish you nothing but love and happiness.  We did.  You know what?  For a wedding present, I'm going to get you a Quinella.  You bet.  That was it.  We were standing there in suits.  Damn, that's funny.  And OTB.  And all the people were going, damn, they must have hit.  Everyone's looking at us.  It was the preakness.  Come on.  You've got to bet the preakness.  Sure.  So I don't want to hear crappy some Wall Street executive. 
[00:49:00]  He's a back-alley sterno, but I'm with a bankroll.  That's classic.  Yeah, my pal.  Thanks.  Jesus Christ.  I feel like King Kemp.  Let me just tell you, it is respectable trading.  That's it.  It's a legitimate thing.  Okay.  It's not like, you know, put it all on black. 
[00:49:30]  I know from whence you came.  Thank you, Adam.  Wow.  Wonderful.  Well, don't you have to go shoot something?  Yeah, I'm going to shoot you.  You already did.  Anthony, your brother's on the line.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, no.  Hey, Joe.  Hey.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, Joe Buck.  That has some incredible timing.  Hey, you guys remember when you were talking about those songs?  I've been holding off for like the past 20 minutes, man. 
[00:50:00]  I know.  I saw you on the screen.  Anyway.  That's okay.  Why?  Was the president on the other line, Joe?  No, but I just don't like hanging on hold on a long-distance call for 25 minutes.  I miss my son.  Listen, everybody's pissed today.  Everyone's ragging.  Joe Cranky.  We're going to pass out the tampons after this break.  Everybody's on the rag, man.  Wait, maybe some soothing music will take care of it.  Yeah.  Oh, shut up. 
[00:50:30]  I know what that is.  Wait.  All right.  That's great.  Hear it?  Good.  I have the chorus coming up.  That's okay.  Who wrote it?  I'll admit.  I wrote it.  Yeah.  Okay.  Wait, wait.  So?  What are we listening to, Ed?  I don't know.  I do.  Oh, and this is Joe wrote it.  We're listening to Zebra.  Yeah, might as well.  Yeah, and who engineered it? 
[00:51:00]  Hey, man, I've got to have something better than this.  Oh, is this a blame fest today?  What is going on?  Yeah.  All right.  So, Ed, I'm assuming this is you as the lead singer.  As is.  Uh-oh.  What is he doing?  Hey, Joe.  Yeah.  Don't you have a stack head to staple?  Yeah, I do.  I do.  In fact, that's what's giving me my investment money.  Yeah, good.  How's ECNC doing, Joe?  I keep on talking about it.  This is the best thing.  We've been doing about three hours. 
[00:51:30]  Hold the phone.  Joe, I get this phone call from Joe.  Right.  And I got a good tip.  Invest.  ECNC.  It's e-connect.  Something to do with Palm Pilot, which took off.  You know, Palm, the IPO, which tanked also.  And he goes, check this out.  So, it was like a 10.  It went up to 20 the next day.  Joe, did you pop out at 20?  22 it went up to.  Yeah, 22.  Did you pop out?  No, Joe got greedy.  What happened?  The company, all of a sudden, the NASDAQ throws him off the NASDAQ. 
[00:52:00]  The Security and Exchange Commission, like, pretty much puts the head of the company in jail.  This guy is the biggest scam artist.  And they suspend all trading on the company.  They opened trading yesterday.  It went down to pennies.  No, no, no.  It's still in dollars.  It's like two bucks.  It's like two bucks.  They opened up trading.  They suspended it when it was like a 10.  The day they opened trading, it went down eight points.  It was sitting in two bucks.  Yeah, no, no.  It was at 25 cents.  It opened on Monday. 
[00:52:30]  That was Joe's first investment.  It'll end up coming back.  You know something?  You're reading the goddamn message boards on Raging Bull, aren't you?  No.  All the people.  Stick with it.  I'm long and strong, baby.  The damn thing's tech.  Go to the site and see what the company's doing.  The CEO is John Dillinger.  How is this guy going to run a company from Sinsling?  He's totally vindicated, man.  Vindicated.  You don't want even the word vindicated to be used. 
[00:53:00]  I don't understand.  When you're investing money, you don't want to hear that word.  You don't look at the...  What about Microsoft?  Yeah, so?  It's a legitimate company.  So is eConnect.  eConnect.  It's a legitimate company, man.  Yeah, if they're flying dope, maybe, from Columbia.  Yeah, the corporate office is cell block D.  You're a pisser.  You can't accept the fact that your first investment tanked.  Hey, man.  And you're going to...  It happens.  It's going to happen for the first year. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  It happens.  It does.  I went into AirTran, my first investment.  I got in at 10.  It was ValueJet.  It was ridiculous.  The stock went from $1.90-something on the prior Monday.  Right.  I bought the following Monday at $10.  By that Friday, or by that Thursday, it was up to $22.  This thing had volume on it more than any of the blue chip stocks on their best friggin' day.  In a week, it went up $20, from $1 to $20. 
[00:54:00]  You don't think that SEC isn't going to look into it?  You didn't know the meaning of pump and dump it.  Because this is what's alleged.  The head of the company said they had an arrangement, a deal, an exclusive deal with Palm.  Right.  For the Palm Pilots that came out.  He had nothing with Palm.  Nothing, nothing, Joe.  He had something you could...  Palm Island, but it wasn't an exclusive agreement.  You know what the agreement was?  It was exclusive. 
[00:54:30]  All right.  You know what the agreement was?  Anybody can go to the Palm site and fill out a form where you have an agreement with Palm.  That's the truth.  Anyone could do it.  You could...  I could log on right now, and while we're on the phone, have an agreement with Palm.  Semantics.  Semantics.  And then the CEO is getting on saying he's pumping the crap out of that stock,  saying he has an exclusive deal, and all of a sudden the SEC looks into it,  and almost...  They put a restraining order against the guy.  I have a question.  Why are they trading again? 
[00:55:00]  Why are they trading again?  It's so long and bad with what they did.  Why is the stock trading again?  Where is it trading, Joe?  Huh?  On NASDAQ?  No.  It's trading on the NASDAQ.  It is not.  It's trading in some over-the-counter, crap-o, South American trading company.  Originally it was over-the-counter bulletin board.  Now it's over-the-counter SM.  It's trading at two.  If I want to buy some, do I got to wait for, like, the cafeteria truck to pull out?  Pretty much, Adam.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Buy now.  I'm telling you.  Joe, bail out when it's at two. 
[00:55:30]  Keep an eye on the stock, man.  Just keep an eye on it.  Joe, you're like...  Keep an eye on it.  He's like...  He's like Bud Shox.  What the fuck?  He's Bud Shox.  He's Bud Shox.  He died in the back stretch.  Yeah.  No, no.  The horse really died.  They came out with a bull-roser.  They did.  What?  I bet on a horse...  The horse died.  In the back stretch, it just went...  Felt down.  Died.  Died.  It was like Animal House.  The jock was getting off the horse.  Yeah.  The jock was getting...  And the thing reared up.  It died.  Hello.  They took the truck out, loaded him up. 
[00:56:00]  It was worth the two bucks.  Oh, without a doubt.  What's funny is that...  That's a good bet.  Sean's face, this guy's Sean goes...  That ain't good.  All right.  Joe, your email is screwed up.  Adam, what?  I'm going to give you a copy of the CD to bring in next time.  Okay.  Great.  I don't think I'm ever invited back there.  You can come in any time you want, Joe.  You know you can.  Joe, we're waiting for you to come up with the most offensive song for the most offensive  song contest.  I already have it in the works, but I thought I might be precluded from... 
[00:56:30]  What is...  What's the matter, Joe?  Recipating.  All right.  There's a problem here, Joe.  Employees of the family of WNEW are not eligible.  There you go.  No.  Disclaimer.  Anthony, talk to your brother.  What's the matter, Joe?  Is the insulation glue getting to your head?  I'm going to wrap your head...  I swear to God, I'm going to wrap you into a scrim.  Joe, we've been...  Up in an attic somewhere.  We've been waiting for your song.  I know.  I'll come up with one, and then I'll come in.  The ones that are supposed to be funny are the most offensive ones.  I figure if you write one of the most offensive ones, it should be really good. 
[00:57:00]  It'll be really offensive.  All right, man.  You're welcome any time to come in here.  You know that.  All right, cool.  I ran into Cal Bell Bill, by the way.  He's back from Florida?  He came by work.  He's back.  And he came back with a truck.  He's got a brand new floor on him.  Bring him when you come in.  He's real funny.  I'm kidding with you.  Give me a break.  All right.  I'll see you guys later.  All right, man.  Adam, give me a call at home.  I don't have your email address.  All right, pal.  All right, brother.  There he goes.  What a slugfest today this has been. 
[00:57:30]  Wow.  This is great.  ECNC.  I love that guy.  Everyone has a stock tip, though.  It's like a-holes.  We all have them.  Dude, this was a-  It's like that scene in The Graduate.  Plastics.  Yeah, plastics.  Wherever you go, though.  You know what it is?  A lot of-  Unless you do some research and look at these things, it is a frigging pyramid scam.  Remember the pyramid scams of the 70s and 80s?  Oh, you got them.  Adam, how much did you lose?  Yeah.  You know what it is?  It's the same thing.  There's always some cousin going, you're going to get yours back first. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah, yeah.  No, you're the one that's going to get it.  I'm telling you.  You bring in a few more people, you go up on the pyramid.  That's how it happens.  It costs you 10 grand to get in.  All right.  Before you know it, next week, I give you 25 grand.  You're out.  That's it.  You made your money.  You made 15 grand, and you'll never see me again.  All of a sudden, what happened to my money?  Oh, the pyramid collapsed.  Oh.  Oh.  Remember the Mayans?  Oh, the same thing.  The whole damn civilization.  The whole city died.  They left it.  They're half-billed.  Sacrificed aversion.  Jewelry was an aversion.  All the money's gone. 
[00:58:30]  So some of these stock tips are like that, especially the over-the-counter ones.  If they're not on the NASDAQ, the Amex, the New York Stock Exchange, some of these things  aren't looked into before people can start trading them.  This one, ECNC, just took a dump.  First, it skyrocketed in a week, which is enough to tell you something isn't quite right.  Right.  So when Joe called me with this tip, I'm like, wait a minute.  What is this?  I look at what it did.  I'm like, come on.  This thing's spiking like a freaking, like an icicle.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  And the next day, trading suspended.  I was like, oh, Joe.  Oh.  Whoops.  Yeah.  What happened?  I can't get my money out.  I was up to 20.  It started to go.  I was up to 10.  What happened?  Now, let me ask you something.  If you were to win in the morning and you would have sold it like at 20 words.  Oh, you're in.  You're in.  Oh, you made your money.  You get your money back?  Oh, yeah.  Nothing happened.  At the expense of the poor saps that stayed.  Really?  That's called not being greedy.  Oh, all right.  You can't be greedy. 
[00:59:30]  You got to take profits.  If you're going to stay in something for a long time, for years, you want to retire on  something like Dell or IBM or Microsoft or something, that's fine.  You leave your money in.  It goes up.  It goes down.  You don't bother with it until you're ready to retire.  Right.  That's fine.  That's a great way to do it.  If you're playing it on a daily basis, you don't stay in them too long because eventually  people are going to pull out and it's going to take a dump.  If you make some money on it, you make a good return on what you put in, pull out.  And if you look at it the next time, hey, I curse, you go, oh, hell, it would have been 
[01:00:00]  nice if I stayed in.  But, you know, you got out, you made your money, and that's what you do.  You can't get too greedy.  Is that your Wall Street talk?  Yeah.  I flip around the S word, and when I'm really serious, the F word and the C word come down.  It's great.  And it has happened.  Let me tell you something about these effing bonds.  That's what you mean.  They should put me on CNBC.  Squawk Box with Anthony.  Yeah.  Well, listen, Steve C. from the unofficial LB and Anthony website, foundrymusic.com,  writes, I totally forgot I had this, but I just found the video clip of Adam's Hospitaliano 
[01:00:30]  Olive Garden commercial.  Oh!  I am putting it up on the unofficial website.  A return engagement of hospitality.  I gotta go.  I gotta go.  What is it?  Come on, pal.  It's your friends.  Hi, let me give you a hug.  And here, take this from the groin.  Be proud of your work.  You cast a check, right?  I'm talking about the work I took to cast a check.  I know.  I go, Pop, I don't know if I should do this.  You know, my father says, hey, you want to be an artist?  Go rent a loft and be misunderstood. 
[01:01:00]  You need to eat.  Ah, that's great.  It was funny, because I get the job on this pilot, right?  Yeah.  I call my parents, and they say, congratulations.  Now, every day the phone rings.  My father's like, hey, De Niro, did the ship come in?  That's hilarious.  I'm getting tired.  He's a funny guy.  Big Joe.  All right.  You staying?  You going?  I gotta split.  Oh, look at him.  Look at him.  I gotta go.  Remember the old Tonight Show with Johnny Carson?  Bob Hope would walk in, do a quick thing, and he's like, now Johnny gotta leave. 
[01:01:30]  He can't stay and slide down the couch until Johnny Bishop would come on.  He's the gotta leave guy.  You gotta leave.  Gotta leave.  You're the gotta leave guy now.  His career has made it to the gotta leave guy.  Can't slide down the couch, can you?  Not.  Got laundry.  Can't wait for a couple of rum and cola, some fluffing and folding.  Can't wait for Jim Fowler to bring out the snakes.  I'm sorry I'm going to miss the ring.  All right, pal.  I want to be able to watch the squirrel dump on the desk.  Well, best of luck to you.  Tell Dennis Leary we said hi. 
[01:02:00]  You got it.  And send him up here if you can, because we don't know him at all.  You don't?  No.  What are you kidding?  He's like a real stomp.  Sure.  We don't have those people here.  No offense.  Wang, it's a parking lot.  Best of luck to you, my pal.  Break a leg.  Hey, buddy, where's your hat?  Thank you, champ.  Looks good on you, though.  All right, and we'll take a break.  We've got Spaz Radio next.  We've got to thank Adam.  Adam, thank you for stopping in.  And if the series gets picked up, you're in New York for good. 
[01:02:30]  I'm in New York.  Yeah.  Well, we can all hope and pray for that one.  So, like, Greg, you want a daily basis.  I've got to come home.  As much as you aggro, maybe I miss you.  Yeah, you're pissed.  All right.  Look, I'm getting a twitch back in my office.  As we take a break, more Mets tickets to opening day, Anthony.  All right.  Cool.  Want to just give away one pair?  Two?  All right.  Two four-packs of tickets to Mets opening day at Shea.  Monday with Psycho Mark, courtesy of smallworld.com.  It's a fantasy baseball website.

[01:03:00]  Oh, let me just say thank you to Mike Charles, detective at the 19th Precinct.  Let us go in there and look around.  All the guys at the 19th Precinct.  Did he get you out of a ticket?  No, it's a cop show.  Oh, yeah.  Adam's playing a cop.  So, you had to do a little research.  Sure.  Look at you, method acting.  I get a gun and everything.  Do they hand out the plungers?  But we've got to thank Mike Charles for taking care of us.  Okay, very good.  Good job.  Look at you playing a cop.  Tenth and eleventh callers, get the med tickets.  Two, one, two, seven.  Look at you playing a stock. 
[01:03:30]  Two, seven.  I love it.  I don't want to turn the mics off.  It's too much fun.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Spaz Radio next.  Stay there.  I'm a man.  Well, you guys are both stupid.  You're like a black eye for all mankind.  I don't think they're very nice people.  The only way I could actually think they were funny was to be going to heroin.  Hoppy and Anthony.  You know, I just like want to throw up.  Feel the love.  1027 WNEW.  Anthony Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. 
[01:04:00]  Yes.  It works.  I've got to tell you, the email's coming in a lot lately.  A lot of people checking out this stack or two, and it's working for them.

With my favorite man, Adam Ferraro, who you haven't introduced me to yet.  Adam rocks.  Yeah, you know why?  He's got a girlfriend.  Oh, all right.  Well, when he does it.  It's pretty steady.  And I don't want to throw a monkey wrench into that works.  Okay, well, when it's not steady, throw the wrench.  All right.  I love you guys.  Thank you.  So, do you like Stacker 2?

I believe she's the sales girl for Stacker 2, eh?  She's going to sue us.  All right, let's get into Spaz Radio.  Yes, everybody.  I'm eagerly awaiting.  Remember, yesterday, at the end of the show, we took a little journey,  into the mind of Spaz.  He's going to do a feature for us every Friday.  Yeah.  He's going to be doing, what is it, the Week in Review? 
[01:07:30]  Spaz's Week in Review.  He's the biggest dumbass in town.  Spaz Radio.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Cool.  You got your own jingle there, Spaz.  How about that?  That's pretty impressive.  We don't have our own jingles yet.  Are you going to yell at Ben to get you some cans today?  Get you some earphones?  Yeah.  Remember yesterday, he said that, Ben, give me my cans now.  Give me some water.  Yeah, starting on Friday, it's the Week in Review with Spaz.  Yeah.  But he took it upon himself, Ed, while we were on vacation, 
[01:08:00]  to kind of keep us updated on a lot of stories that we were missing  because we were away for a week.  Yeah, you know, when you're on vacation, you don't really pick up the paper and stuff.  And Spaz, thank you.  You put a little tape together and did the news.  Touched on some of the current events that we might be interested in.  Correct.  In a style that I think only Spaz could give you.  And yesterday, we started this tape really late in the show, you know?  Yeah. 
[01:08:30]  We have another, like, 15 minutes to go here.  Oh, at least.  I think we're going to start with Spaz's entertainment break, Anthony.  All right.  Yeah, sort of like an E.T. kind of thing.  Yeah.  Now, what do you cover during this entertainment break?  Hopefully your mouth.  Oh, no.  That's not nice.  I'm sorry.  I cover Kate Moss's new ailment, okay?  New ailment, okay.  And I cover Bill Cosby's retiring once again.  Bill Cosby retiring.  Gee, wait a minute.  Before we start that tape, where's my bell? 
[01:09:00]  Because I know I'm going to need it.  We've got to get the inappropriate bell.  Because if he's doing a Bill Cosby thing, you know, and KKK dog takes the mic, racism isn't far behind.  A lot of people are peeking in the studio to see what a stupid guy looks like.  Oh, come on.  Hey, this isn't my bell.  Is my bell in the cart?  See, that's a...  Oh, there's the inappropriate bell right down there.  You know what the inappropriate bells that we gave out are like?  Do we still have those to give away, Ben?  A few. 
[01:09:30]  We have a few inappropriate bells left.  We'll have them at our next road show, I think.  You know what the...  There it is.  Yeah.  See, this is the real one.  Right.  Right.  And here's the one we were giving out.  Now, it's almost like, you know, like a costume for Halloween.  You see Batman on TV, and Batman's costume is like Batman's costume.  Oh, yeah.  This is Batman's costume.  This is the one, like, you buy for Halloween.  It's kind of cheap.  It doesn't really look like it.  It's kind of second-rate plastic.  Yeah. 
[01:10:00]  I can't use that.  I hate Spaz.  Can't stand update.  Spaz is so dumb.  Spaz is so dumb.  Can't let Spaz do update.  Why?  Why don't these people want to hear the Spaz update every week?  Tony, what's the problem?  No, man.  You can't let him do any updates of any kind, bro.  There's no way, bro.  Why?  He's a retard.  Maybe this is where his talents lie.  No way, dude.  No way, dude.  I got like 40 guys down here. 
[01:10:30]  I work in Jersey.  I'm a cable guy.  Yeah.  And they're all freaking out, dude.  There's no way, dude.  All right.  Thanks, Tony.  There's no way, dude.  Top of the food chain.  All right.  Thank you.  I don't know.  This was a very entertaining segment, according to the listeners yesterday.  Yes.  Leon.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  First time, quite a long-time listener.  Oh, thank you, Leon.  Thank you.  Hey, listen.  I view myself as a rather pacified human being and pretty calm, but I got to tell you,  on the way home yesterday, I was just pounding the steering wheel.  I never learned or thought it possible for somebody to hate somebody else so quickly. 
[01:11:00]  Just from hearing his voice.  Uh, the very knowledge of his existence on this planet and classified as a homo sapien  is enough to drive other people to suicide.  Wow, Leon.  A lot of people have a lot of passion for Spaz.  Not good passion.  I have passion for Spaz.  Yeah.  Not good passion, but...  Rock on, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Spaz, you really get people pissed off.  It's amazing.  Yeah, for some reason, just the sound of your voice.  All right.  Well, let's get into Spaz Radio, Anthony.  Okay.  He did another fake radio show for us, and I guess we're going to start with his entertainment 
[01:11:30]  break, Anthony.  All right.  If you need me to stop the tape at any time, just raise your hand, okay?  So, I know.  Uh, will uncontrollable laughter be a key?  Okay.  Here we go.  Wait.  Where's the Spaz Radio jingle?  He's the biggest dumbass in town.  Spaz Radio.  Now, for the entertainment break of the, uh, Key Dog Show, here on WSBZ. 
[01:12:00]  The only show to be on on Saturday nights, especially today.  What?  Whoa!  What do you mean it's the only show that's on?  Are you, like, broadcasting from another planet?  No.  What I'm saying is that it's the only show worth tuning into on every Saturday night.  Okay.  Of course.  All right.  March the 25th.  Anyway, uh, Cosby, Bill Cosby is calling it a quits once again.  Bill Cosby is kind of like the Magic Johnson of entertainment. 
[01:12:30]  He quits a show, comes back for another, quits a show, comes back for another.  Says he's retired, but not really.  Okay.  Like a wrestling storyline.  Hold on.  Magic Johnson.  Yes.  Did he quit and then come back and quit and came back?  Yes, he did.  Yeah?  Oh, but not TV.  No.  He just got fired from his TV show and that was it.  No, it's not about an NBA.  Oh, okay.  It was cross-referencing there.  No, I'm not getting on it.  I was just, I had to clear that up with myself.  Okay.  I guess that was my fault for not being a basketball fan.  Okay. 
[01:13:00]  Okay.  All right.  Very good.  Okay.  Anyway, he's calling it quits after four years with his new Cosby show.  Seems like every show this guy is a part of.  It's called the Cosby show.  Go figure.  All right.  What do you, what do you want him to call a show?  Something different, being more creative and inventive than calling it the Cosby show.  It's becoming too rhetoric.  Rhetoric.  Too rhetoric?  Oh, my God.  Whoa. 
[01:13:30]  Or rhetorical.  Hold on.  I just have to let that sink in for a minute.  Please hold.  I'm trying to see if it makes sense in any way.  It's becoming too rhetoric.  It's becoming too rhetoric.  I own it, right?  Yes.  Okay.  Just making sure.  Just making sure.  That's all.  Don't be alarmed.  All right.  All right.  Give me the dictionary.  Yeah.  Let's look up the word rhetoric and make sure it definitely doesn't work in that statement.  Okay.  Yeah, because Opie, maybe it's us.  It's becoming too rhetoric.  Rhetoric.  Rhetoric. 
[01:14:00]  To name every show he does, the Cosby show, right?  Yes.  Okay.  And do you know how to spell rhetoric?  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, my spelling is not like it.  Rhet.  R-E-T.  It's R-H-E-T.  R-H-E-T.  R-H.  Right.  Turn the page.  Thank you, Spence.  Turn the page.  R-H-T-E-N-I-M-E-C-V-E-A.  Okay.  I'm going to see.  Let me look it up. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, rhetoric.  Okay.  It's becoming too rhetoric.  Yeah.  The art of speaking or writing effectively.  The study of principles and rules of composition formulated by critics of ancient times.  Two, skilled in the effective use of speech.  B, a type or mode of language or speech.  Three, verbal communication.  It's becoming to verbal communication.  The Cosby Show is becoming to the art of speaking or writing. 
[01:15:00]  Effectively.  Or the Cosby Show is becoming to a skill and effective use of speech.  All right.  All right, Spaz, I guess it does make sense there.  Sure, absolutely.  Why not?  King Gimp checking in in River Edge, New Jersey.  What did King Gimp say?  Listening to Spaz, I'm falling to the ground and convulsing uncontrollably again while I'm typing this.  Great. 
[01:15:30]  That's great.  Should have said rhetorical.  King Spaz.  All right, ready?  Let's move on with the Cosby break.  Yeah, so after four years, CBS is calling to quits on his contract, threatening to cancel the show because of, I don't know, maybe ratings or something like that.  Repetitive.  But because it's going against, I guess, wrestling because it's on Monday nights and everybody watches wrestling and nobody watches Cosby, I guess.  Nobody wants to see any more Pudding Pops because they don't like them anymore.  But he's calling it quits before they cancel the show, which I think is a smart move because I think it's more humiliating to get your show canceled. 
[01:16:00]  And it's more, I don't know, uplifting and showing more in-face if you just leave on your own before, you know, the crap hits the fan.  Do you understand?  Is that the actual lip smack?  That's Scott's house.  Goddamn, that's great. 
[01:16:30]  Helen Keller checking in, Anthony.  Oh, really?  Yes.  I love the emails we get from Helen Keller.  Helen Keller writes, thank God I can't hear this.  And Uncle Al from Manhattan is trying to just help you out, Spaz.  Not rhetoric, redundant.  Redundant?  Redundant would have worked there.  Okay.  Yes.  But it's redundant, a-hole. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, my God.  That's great.  Screw King Gimp.  We got King Spaz.  I swear.  And I got to say this.  It might be obvious, but I got to say it.  He's not kidding for you.  This isn't a little joke.  Damien.  Yeah.  Hi, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Talking to you.  Love your show.  You're on the air.  Let's go, fast.  Yo, I actually am embarrassed I'm with Iona.  Well.  I swear to God.  That's no surprise.  And also, I called my friend to check on Spaz's diploma. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  I don't think he even graduated.  I did.  You definitely graduated Spaz?  Barely.  Okay.  Fair.  I actually remember it.  Listen to him in the cafeteria.  All right.  Oh, there you go.  Was he a great college jock?  No, man.  People fell asleep in the cafeteria.  Half of it.  All right.  Well, thank you, Damien.  Take care, guys.  All right.  Bye.  There he goes.  Damien, let's move on with the tape, Anthony.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I think we're still in the Cosby break here. 
[01:18:00]  Wow.  What?  What?  Jimmy from Teaneck.  A little, I don't know, a little excited about this whole thing.  Kill Spaz now.  No questions.  Just kill him.  The hatred.  Let's move on.  All right.  Anyway, his CBS sitcom is ending.  I believe the last episode will be this May.  So, everybody, go get your videotapes and tape it because I'm sure another Cosby show  ending, this is like, what, the third or fourth Cosby show, it should be worth taping  and worth something in the future, I would assume, until he comes back for another Cosby 
[01:18:30]  show and you have to tape the final episode of that one in five years.  Anyway, moving on to Kate Moss.  All right.  We move on.  Thank God.  Mercifully, we move on to Kate Moss.  We made it through that.  You say anyway a lot, Spaz.  It's a habit of mine.  But one good thing, not once in that whole thing on Cosby did he call him a spook.  Which is a credit to you, Spaz.  Before we move on with Kate Moss, let's go to Anthony on line one. 
[01:19:00]  Anthony, what's up?  Hello.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, dude.  You guys, I'm crying.  I'm laughing so hard.  I mean, I work for the city of Yorkers, all right?  Yeah.  I got at least 140, 150 people that think this is like the best, man.  You got to let this kid do commentary, man.  He should do mornings here.  He's a riot.  Well, he's going to start his new segment Friday called The Week in Review with Spaz.  We're going to have him do national and local news.  Oh, my God.  I got one phone to pick one. 
[01:19:30]  And an entertainment report and a sports update every Friday.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead.  Peace out.  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  Let's go to Tommy before we get to the Kate Moss commentary, Anthony.  Tommy, what's up?  Tommy.  You with me?  Yeah.  Let's go.  Anthony, the legislation should be passed to stop this jerk off from reproducing.  This guy's got to be the dumbest son of a bitch on the planet.  Thank you, Tommy.  Thank you. 
[01:20:00]  Spaz is very shocked to hear these people calling in, berating him.  Al Sharpton checks in, Anthony.  Oh, really?  I want to recruit Spaz to be my speechwriter.  Hey, Spaz, would you say a lot of the calls that are coming in, they're basically voicing  the same opinions.  Would you say they're rhetoric?  Rhetorical.  Would you say they're rhetorical?  Rhetorical.  Or redundant.  Or redundant.  Which one?  Rhetorical.  Spaz's mom checking in, Anthony.  Oh, really? 
[01:20:30]  Come on, don't go there.  Oh, come on.  I never meant to drop him on the floor if somebody comes.  That's funny.  Oh, my God.  Not allowed to make fun of Spaz's mom or dad, right?  No.  He's the biggest dumbass in town.  Spaz Radio.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  All right.  Let's move on with the Kate Moss segment of the entertainment news from Spaz.  Entertainment news.  Like E.T.  Moving on to Kate Moss. 
[01:21:00]  She's been sidelined by kidney ailment.  She's been sidelined in the past in November of 98 when she was going out with bad boy Johnny  Depp, and she was sidelined back then with alcohol and drug problems.  But the skinny mini of the entertainment world is sidelined with the kidney injury.  I guess it's because of all those drugs and alcohol.  Do you see a pattern here?  Anyway, the girl.  No, not the company.  No.  Skinny mini. 
[01:21:30]  Ooh.  Ooh.  The skinny mini.  Did you make that up yourself?  Right off the top of my head.  Wow.  Very impressive.  Off the top of your head.  Come on.  Nice.  I wrote none of this out.  Cool.  Wow, really?  Yes.  Drop a dime.  Let me know what's on your mind.  Let me know what's on your mind.  Give me a buck.  I suck.  Thank you.  All right, moving on with Kate Moss.  All right.  Anyway, the girl doesn't eat like many of the models out there who think that, I guess, 
[01:22:00]  not eating and puking up whatever they eat and taking, I don't know, all these pills and  crap to look skinny and have small breasts.  You notice that every model has little, like, I don't know, Reese's Pieces, Reese's Peanutbutter  Breasts.  They never had big ones.  Okay, terrific.  You are like Bob Grant if you got hit on the head with a ball-peen hammer a few times. 
[01:22:30]  What are these models with their skinny mini little breasts?  The news part isn't enough, him to say in the news.  Then he's got a little commentary on it.  It's great.  He editorializes it.  Yeah.  So you have a problem.  He rhetoricals a little bit.  So you have a problem with models with small breasts.  Yes.  I also have a problem that they don't eat and then they puke up whatever little they do  eat.  It's just that nobody can look like a Barbie doll. 
[01:23:00]  Just look like yourself.  And people go for the natural look.  So you're going to win the competitions better with a natural look than trying to look like  a skeleton Barbie doll, I believe.  All right.  Wait a minute.  Models have competition?  Is it like an Olympic event or something?  No, but when they go for those beauty contests, like the Miss USA or pageants or whatever  like that, they figure that not eating is the best way to go and you need the food.  Security.  Security.  Ninth floor. 
[01:23:30]  Security.  Security.  Okay.  Code blue.  Code blue.  Let's move on with the Kate Moss commentary.  People should look into that.  Anyway, it should be prerequisite to have bigger boobs than a, I don't know, AAA cup.  But anyway, yeah, Kate Moss, I like a kidney injury and a kidney ailment, I should say,  and I think it's probably alcohol related.  She was supposed to go on vacation with a 22-year-old.  How do you know it was alcohol related that she's got a kidney problem? 
[01:24:00]  Well, she's...  Allegedly.  No, but it's been proven that she's an alcoholic.  And so I think that all of her problems derive from that.  Now, when you're an alcoholic, you think that the kidney is more affected than the liver?  Oh, my God.  Kidney and liver.  Yeah, but the liver turns green, but the kidney system could also be affected.  What?  Why?  The liver turns green?  Yes.  Like Ajax scrubbing bubbles.  Wait, the liver turns green.  No, see, when the liver decays, it turns the color greenish. 
[01:24:30]  When was the last time you saw a liver?  Science class.  Was it a human liver?  I believe so.  Oh.  It turns green.  It turns like darkish greenish type color.  Darkish greenish type color.  It's a tint of green in it.  Not like yellow, like jaundice or anything that you would catch.  Not a sort of green.  Okay, horrific.  All right.  And Spaz's father checking in.  All right.  More instant feedbacks and e-mails coming in? 
[01:25:00]  I blame myself for drinking that night, so I'm cutting my own balls off.  All right, from Jersey.  He's getting pissed.  Does the little yellow school bus pick him up to bring him to work?  Spaz is a positive one.  Don Imus checking in.  I say give Spaz the new morning spot.  Quack, quack.  Yeah.  Plenty of them just coming in here.  Buck from New Jersey. 
[01:25:30]  Smoking crack is better for the brain than listening to Spaz.  I'm not even skipping any here.  Okay.  Can you take Spaz out back and put a bullet through his freaking head?  Please end the misery.  Yeah.  Okay, horrific.  I got one.  Oh, Iona.  Yeah, Chris from Connecticut.  Hey, guys, here's the new morning show.  Spaz and King Kip.  They're laughing out there.  Wow. 
[01:26:00]  This is good stuff.  And how many kidneys does a human being have?  Two.  Two, okay.  Two.  Just want to make sure.  Very good.  Okay, let's move on with the Kate Moss comedy.  Yes.  And models having tiny little boobs, and Spaz thinks all models should have big, huge hooters.  Right?  And shouldn't puke.  And shouldn't puke.  I'm learning.  Boyfriend.  Oh, wait.  Where are we on the day?  Who her boyfriend is?  Her 22-year-old boyfriend, isn't she?  Yes.  All right.  She was supposed to go somewhere with this 22-year-old boyfriend, Kate Moss? 
[01:26:30]  Yes.  Oh, okay.  So the giant mosquito stumped her kidney.  Boyfriend.  And who is, I believe, Jesse Wood, the son of the Rolling Stones guitarist, Ron Wood.  I guess that's important to mention.  Anyway, they were preparing for vacation.  She had to go to the hospital once again.  So my message to you, Kate Moss.  If she's listening.  Which I think you should heed is, stay off the drugs and alcohol.  No joke. 
[01:27:00]  Wait, I got to hear that.  Oh, my God.  She needs to heed this.  Which I think you should heed is, stay off the drugs.  Wouldn't you just use the word hear there?  Like, you want to tell her something so you think she should hear this?  Well, I just wanted to make the point perfectly clear.  Heed Spaz's warning.  We should call it.  Okay.  Heed my warning.  Stay off the drugs and alcohol because they're bad.  I'm sure you'll learn that in the 26 years on this planet. 
[01:27:30]  Thank you, Captain Owens.  And eat.  Because food provides you with energy.  What?  Food can help you get bigger breasts.  Food can actually help you win those model competitions that you're in.  What?  Oh, that is wrong on so many levels.  Food can give you bigger breasts.  What kind of food gives you the biggest breasts, Spaz?  Yeah.  No bigger breasts.  What is it?  Food provides, gives you weight to your body. 
[01:28:00]  Right.  And the weight distributes throughout your whole body.  So it can give you a bigger cup size, I think.  But because everything...  Holy smock.  It's also going to give you a big ass.  Right.  Yeah.  But if you eat enough food that your breasts get bigger, you're going to have a tank for an ass.  Right.  And it's compensation.  And then she won't be able to model.  Right.  But it's compensation.  There are ways to get that ass trimmed down and keep the bigger breasts.  Through eating.  Oh, yeah.  And, yeah, but when you get the bigger ass, then you take dietary supplements. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, my God.  All right.  So then what happens to the big boobs if you take the dietary supplements?  Well, sometimes the dietary supplements will concentrate on a specific part of your body.  What?  So they concentrate on the lower part of your body.  Dr. Spaz.  Jesus Christ.  Wait.  So the dietary supplements have a brand of their own is what you're saying.  They know exactly where to go, right?  I would think that there are some supplements out there that concentrate on a specific part of your body.  Yes.  Because you know how some people want to get rid of the fat in their legs, but their top looks perfect.  Right.  So they take a special pill that knows exactly where the fat in the legs is. 
[01:29:00]  A doctor can, I guess, describe one.  Yeah.  A doctor on Pluto, maybe.  Or Venus, perhaps, if you want a closer doctor.  Earth?  Um, no.  Not on our home planet.  And Iona College checking in.  All right.  They're on their way to take back his diploma.  En route.  It's sirens wailing, I'm sure.  Not a moment too soon.  Matt from Jersey.  Hey, ONA, this just in.  The head of communications at Iona College just jumped into the East River. 
[01:29:30]  And Muhammad Ali checking in today.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Great.  Spaz, thank you.  I once had a fear of embarrassing myself on the radio.  You have proven that nobody can be worse than you.  Barnaby Jones checking in.  MD himself.  Geriatric gumshoe.  Uh, thanks for the advice, Spaz.  He learned something today.  It was Spaz raised by wolves.  He's the biggest F in retard I've ever heard.  It sounds like Spaz didn't eat enough before making this tape. 
[01:30:00]  Uh, Michael from Jersey.  Anthony, how the F does he manage to answer the phone?  Spoketh the Spaz.  Heed my words, Minnie Moss.  And eat breast food.  What the F?  Uh, Drew from Freehold.  Did Spaz come out feet first when he was born?  Jesus Christ.  So just eat a little bit more.  Nobody likes a skeleton.  If I wanted to see a skeleton, I would have been awake during science class.  Okay? 
[01:30:30]  So, eat.  Get big of breasts.  Stop with the drugs and alcohol.  And you'll be a better person for it.  Alright?  Alright.  That's it for my entertainment portion of the break.  Okay, terrific.  He's the biggest dumbass in town.  Spaz Radio.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Wow, the phones are just going nuts here.  I'm going to pee myself. 
[01:31:00]  Let's go to Jimmy.  Jimmy, you're next on WNAW.  How are you?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  You don't realize who you got there.  You know how famous he is?  Huh?  That's Jerry's original kid.  I'm telling you.  Between yesterday with the history, I took a test in school today.  Where's the Parthenon?  I put down Wisconsin.  I'm telling you.  Did any survive in the litter?  I'm telling you.  And plus now that he's Jerry's original kid,  he can make money on his side as a poster boy for retroactive abortion. 
[01:31:30]  People are just sending faxes in saying, please kill me.  Oh, my God.  Rob from CenterEach.  I just took my diploma from Iona off the wall and wiped my ass with it.  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, what up?  Hey.  How long has Spaz been living on this earth?  I mean, like, Raff Boy's been in this country for how long?  And he could speak better English and he's smarter.  What's up with that?  Well, we should, Spaz, is Raff Boy going to be part of your Week in Review on Friday? 
[01:32:00]  Yes, he is.  Okay.  Very good.  Wow, this just in.  Oh.  Yeah.  Reggie Harris killed himself because he heard Spaz doing the news yesterday.  It wasn't natural causes.  Frank, what's going on?  Hey, I want to know if Spaz survived an abortion when he was a kid.  Oh, my God. 
[01:32:30]  Okay.  Well, Ed, we do have to take a break.  Oh, no.  Really?  We have, I've got to take a leak really bad.  We have one more break in Spaz Radio.  And what is this subject?  Well, he has a quick rant on how much he hates the Yankees.  Oh, no.  That ought to get some fans.  And, oh, my God.  Hold on to your seat.  On the Way.  Yeah.  His political commentary.  Ah, political.  Oh, nice.  A little politics.  What he thinks of Rudy. 
[01:33:00]  What he thinks of Hillary.  Well, this will probably affect the way I vote.  The upcoming election, I'm sure.  What, Ben?  You've got to get Ben rushing in with some more emails.  Okay.  Oh, the gimp checking in again.  The gimp again?  King gimp?  I'm laughing so hard I fell out of my wheelchair again.  The dean from Iona, Anthony.  Yeah.  Apply to our school.  Apparently, all you need is a pulse to attend.  Yeah, the entrance exam.  They hold a mirror up to your mouth.  If it fogs, you're in. 
[01:33:30]  Okay.  So, right after commercials.  Oh, my God.  His Yankee rant.  Spaz being a huge Met fan.  I'm embarrassed to be a Met fan.  Because of the things you're saying this next break.  Even without Spaz, he could be embarrassed.  Easy.  And his political discussion.  All in just a few minutes.  Stay there.  What other radio show is going to give you, like, intelligent talk about stocks and girls  playing what's in my pants?  Yeah.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, man.  Cool.  Oh, man.  As you know, we're going to get to Spaz Radio in just a second here.  Yeah.  But as you know, we have the Most Offensive Song Contest in progress.  Yes.  And these damn songs are arriving, like, every 20 minutes now.  Most of them suck.  They're horrible.  You can't understand the words.  Yeah.  They're not offensive enough, some of them.  No.  But one made the cut today so far.  Yeah. 
[01:34:30]  I listened to 20 songs alone today.  Yeah.  One made the cut.  And I don't even know if it's going to be in the running, but it's worth at least one spin.  And a song called Newborn Baby Soup.  Newborn Baby Soup?  Yeah.  Okay.  That was the only one we were going to play that made the cut today.  And you listened to that one with your feet up on your big desk?  Correct.  In the office.  Okay.  Just checking.  Well, a guy named Q just stopped by with his Most Offensive Song, left it at the front desk.  Yeah.  A song called I'm Horny for Little Girls. 
[01:35:00]  And I were laughing so hard.  We just spit up lunch.  We just got to make it clean for radio because there's a few words in here that are going  to get us in trouble.  They'll dump out.  A couple of lines.  So we definitely have two new songs to debut as part of the Most Offensive Song Contest  today.  Yes.  All after Spaz Radio, of course.  Yes.  And let's get back to Spaz Radio.  Where's our little bumper?  Uh, where is...  Oh, right there.  Okay.  He's the biggest dumbass in town.  Spaz Radio. 
[01:35:30]  All right, Spaz, get your headphones...  Come on!  Get your headphones back on.  Mm-hmm.  All right, now, I guess we're at the part of the tape where you do your little sports  break.  Yes, sports.  Okay, we had news, entertainment, sports, and...  Politics.  Politics, well-rounded.  Yes.  Given that, subject matter's there.  Okay, well, let's get right into this.  This is his commentary on the Yanks and the Mets, Anthony.  Great.  Opening day right around the corner, as we all know.  Yes. 
[01:36:00]  And here we go, with Spaz Radio.  On to baseball.  New York Mets and New York Yankees starting their playoff chases in the next couple weeks.  What?  Wait, what?  What?  Why are they starting their playoff...  What?  Races.  No, chases.  Chases.  Chases.  I'm sorry, playoff chases.  Why are they starting their playoff chases?  It's the beginning of the season.  It's the beginning of the season.  Opening day.  It's opening day.  Yeah, but it's guaranteed that both the Mets and the Yankees will make the playoffs. 
[01:36:30]  Then it wouldn't even be a playoff chase.  No, it's just a...  You're having it a little early to say it's a playoff chase.  Let's just see how they do the first week of the season.  They could sleep out there the first 50 games, and it doesn't matter.  The playoff chase usually begins in August-ish.  It's great to see, you know, the boys of June out there.  My God.  Swinging away.  All right, so they're starting their playoff chase.  Playoff chase.  Yes, because that's their goal towards the end of the season is the playoffs. 
[01:37:00]  So I figured that they're just beginning it now with game one.  Anthony, Amadou Diallo checking in.  What does Amadou have to say?  Why do I get shot 40 times for doing nothing at all while people like Spaz are allowed to walk the earth?  He's got a good question there.  Didn't the Pope check in on your side over there?  The Pope checking in.  The Pope is apologizing for the Holocaust and for the fact that Spaz is walking the earth.  Rudy Giuliani checking in. 
[01:37:30]  As we all know, the political commentary is coming up very soon here on Spaz Radio.  Giuliani writes, if Spaz says one bad thing about me, I'll have him buck down faster than Diallo.  We have guys in the hallway just losing it.  I own a special students unit checking in.  Yes, Spaz did graduate.  His classes consisted of advanced finger painting.  Building Legos 3, Blocks 4, and Using Utensils 3. 
[01:38:00]  Opie celebrities, no strangers to the Opie and Anthony show.  Kate Moss checking in on the instant feedback.  Just ate lunch, boobs grew three sizes.  Wants to thank Spaz for that advice he gave earlier.  Yeah, we learned today, ladies, if you have really tiny boobs, all you have to do is eat a lot of food and you're going to get bigger boobs.  Never mind, your ass will look like a dump truck.  But Spaz also said if your ass gets big with the boobs, you take those magical dietary supplements and go right to the ass. 
[01:38:30]  Yeah, because they have a brain of their own, obviously.  Yeah, at least something does.  And Will Pendar is checking in.  Ho, ho.  Thank God, finally something that can't compete with the 92-minute rock block.  92-minute blockhead.  Oh, the Grease Man checking in from Washington, Anthony.  Yeah.  I think Spaz should be dragged by a truck for his commentary.  Yaddle doodle.  Yaddle doodle, man.  Right.  No wonder they should drag Spaz by a truck, yeah.  Oh, my God. 
[01:39:00]  I've got to read a few more of these before I get back.  I haven't laughed this hard a while.  Bob from Babylon checking in.  I fear that my head will blow up as large as Cardinal Connors if I listen to any more Spaz.  That might be what happened to the good Cardinal.  All right.  That's all I got.  You got any more over there, Ed?  Oh, they are coming in faster than I could even refresh the screen.  Yeah.  It's amazing. 
[01:39:30]  All right.  Well, let's get back to it.  We've got to start this over, the Yankee-Met thing.  Yeah, let's hear it.  With them starting their playoff chases.  On to baseball.  New York Mets and New York Yankees starting their playoff chases in the next couple weeks.  I'm not sure who the Yankees are starting off against because, as everybody knows in the K-Dog show,  all the K-Dog listeners know, that K-Dog does not like the Yankees. 
[01:40:00]  Woo!  So you got faithful listeners like the Opie and Anthony show.  All the K-Dog listeners.  They follow you wherever you go, huh, Spaz?  I had faithful listeners in college.  Very good.  Hey, K-Dog listeners.  Hey, K-Dog listeners.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  What happened to your listeners when the Special Olympics was in town?  I'm on a television. 
[01:40:30]  Marlon Breton, I'm checking in.  Oh, the horror, the horror.  Spaz, proof that man evolved from monkeys.  Except I think monkeys are smarter than Spaz.  Who lets Special Ed walk around without his helmet?  All right, so we're learning that Spaz has followers, Anthony.  Yeah, and they all should know that he hates the Yankees.  The faithful, not Spaz, the faithful K-Dog listener.  K-Dog listener.  Oh, get the two mixed up.  I forgot.  Okay. 
[01:41:00]  I hate them.  I think they're a bunch of cocky SOBs, and I really feel they should not make it this year.  Or any year.  I just hate them.  Don't ask me why.  I just hate them.  If you ask me why, I'll give you like a whole hour answer.  Oh, no.  You probably don't want to sit through.  At least you got that right.  Well, Spaz, now that we have you live on the show, we just listened to the tape.  Yes.  Yeah.  We have to ask.  Yeah.  Why do you hate the Yankees so much? 
[01:41:30]  Because they're cocky to go around New York or any part of the country.  Oh, damn them.  They win.  Oh.  The continent.  Yeah, but the thing is, I don't mind so much that they win.  I respect that part.  Ah.  But the thing is, they're just like the Atlanta Braves.  They go around and say, I'm better than you.  What?  No, no, no.  It's going to happen every year.  They're not like the Atlanta Braves.  No.  They're winners.  I'm a Met fan.  They're not losers.  I'm a Met fan.  The Yankees are not like the Atlanta Braves.  No.  No, I'm not terms of winning and losing records.  I'm talking about their cocky attitudes.  Their cocky attitudes? 
[01:42:00]  That's called confidence.  That's called New York.  Well, let me go one step further, Anthony.  Give us an example of a cocky attitude that you heard from the Yankees.  I don't have a specific quote, but I know that every time that they're on the news giving  a quote for the news, it's just that the way they present themselves, the way they have  their noses up in the air, and the way they bash the Mets.  I mean, it's okay to talk trash.  The outfielders, they're catching pop flies.  Their noses up in the air.  It's okay. 
[01:42:30]  Making the plays.  Making outs.  Not like you're Mike Piazza.  I don't know.  They just have this, I'm better than you, holier than thou.  You know what I said?  Because they're better than any other team.  They're the Yankees.  And talking as a Met fan, don't you think they deserve that right to say that?  They've won a lot of championships lately.  I believe that they should be reserved about it.  They should just keep their winning.  To themselves.  No, I'm just saying.  Black out the last game of the World Series every year so we don't know who won. 
[01:43:00]  No, I'm just saying they should be more reserved about it instead of boasting and being cocky  because then it'll just come right back to them twofold.  Spaz, being a Yankee hater, what do you think of Darryl Strawberry and his recent problems?  Darryl Strawberry's problems.  I think he should get his head together.  I believe that there is no hope.  Actually, you know what?  I think there's no hope for the guy because if he's gone back to it like eight times,  he's just going to remain a coke head for the rest of his life.  That's right.  Where did he learn that?  A hotbed of drug abuse, the Mets.  Yeah, but see, the Mets won. 
[01:43:30]  A win is a win.  Remember that?  So you liked Darryl when he was on the Mets, now you hate him because he's a Yankee?  I think that the Yankees needed ex-Mets to win.  They got David Cohn, Dwight Gooden, Darryl Strawberry.  They needed the ex-Mets to win.  When the Yankees can't beat a team, they buy their players.  They can't strike the ex-Mets to win.  They needed the ex-Mets to win?  That's what you're saying?  When the Yankees can't beat a team, like when they couldn't beat Seattle Mariners,  what do they do?  They just went out and bought their players.  Like Martinez.  Tino Martinez.  They went out and bought him. 
[01:44:00]  Why?  Because they lost to him in the previous wild card game.  It's called free agency.  Every team does it.  Can't beat them, join them.  That's what it's called.  All right.  Anthony Hitler, check it in.  Adolf Hitler.  Yeah, he's living in Hicksville now.  Thank God he included his little address on his email.  God damn it, I missed one.  Chris from the island, check it in.  This is a little obscure, but the faithful listeners will appreciate it.  Spaz is so stupid, Tel Aviv Limo just called. 
[01:44:30]  They want him to work for them.  I'm referring to Hunter.  Andy from Jersey.  Maybe Spaz's doctor can give him supplements that concentrate on growing brain cells.  All right.  Unbelievable.  Are we continuing with our Yankee commentary on the tape there, Spaz?  I believe you have just about a minute left.  All right.  Let's go back to this.  Wait a minute.  Jason checking in.  Since the season is starting and the playoff race is heating up, the Yankees' magic number 
[01:45:00]  is down to 90.  That's great.  Anthony, Dolly Parton, check it in.  From Tennessee.  I didn't even know we were on in Tennessee, Ed.  Yeah.  Thanks, Spaz, for me.  I skipped lunch.  Now my boobs are 34 AAA.  The kid from Massapequa. 
[01:45:30]  Spaz is a living abortion.  You can still see the marks left by the coat hanger and dirty knife.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh.  Okay.  All right.  Let's move on with the commentary on the Yankees, I believe.  Great.  So, on with the Mets.  The better team in the New York area.  The Mets will be beginning their regular season in Japan.  Not sure of what city in Japan, because I don't know Japan that well. 
[01:46:00]  Never been there, but they're beginning their regular season in Japan.  Games will be broadcast this coming Wednesday and Thursday on the Fox Sports Channel at 5 o'clock  in the morning, which is probably about 7 o'clock at Japan time.  In the afternoon, evening, I should say.  So, 5 a.m., Wednesday and Thursday, in Japan, they're playing the Chicago Cubs, and then  they come home to open up their regular season at Shea the following Tuesday.  Not sure against what team, but check your local listings. 
[01:46:30]  Anyway, that's my sports break, and now we're going to be getting into it a little bit.  Do you have a problem with the Mets playing in Japan, Spaz?  Yes.  Wow.  You do?  Yes.  I can hear it.  What seems to be the problem?  Come on!  I believe that they don't deserve to see American baseball over there. 
[01:47:00]  Why is that?  I don't know.  They should just keep on sending over their high-priced players.  They can't really pitch well, Hideki Arabu.  And just keep it at that.  I mean, it...  I don't know.  It's just that the Japs...  The Japs...  Spaz, rolling the Enola Gay off the tournament.  They're another one.  They're just like the Yankees should play over there because they mix well.  They're cocky.  They think they're better than Americans and everything like that, so they should not... 
[01:47:30]  They don't deserve to see great American baseball, and our pastime should not be over there in Japan.  It's wasted money.  People would love to see Sammy Sosa versus the Mets in American soil.  In American soil.  Not even on it.  In it.  In it.  I'm going to lay down in some topsoil.  Cover my head with it.  They're a wasted game at a Tokyo Dome.  They don't even know who the Mets and the Cubs are.  Just they're eating sushi and not knowing what the Mets are. 
[01:48:00]  Note to management, we need another inappropriate, pal.  Ant, this just in.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, horrific.  Steve Mason checking in.  Oh, really?  The morning show here for the next two days.  Yes, finally a radio show I could beat.  I wouldn't count on it.  Spaz Radio.  Anthony, the sniper across the street, checking in. 
[01:48:30]  Let me look around.  I guess he has a laptop on his perch.  Just let me know when you want me to shoot Cade Dog and take him out.  I'm part misery.  The signal will be me lighting a cigarette.  Sniper, anytime you like is the answer to that.  Wouldn't that be funny if his head just exploded?  All right.  I guess you're done with sports.  Yes.  But he goes into a song here. 
[01:49:00]  Let's see how he intros the song in.  All right.  A little of the K-Dog.  Sabotage by the Beastie Boys.  And after that, after Sabotage, I will be sabotaging you with my political talk.  Next on the K-Dog Show.  Oh, yeah.  Get revved up.  I'm getting revved up in my political talk.  Sabotage, Beastie Boys.  K-Dog Show with WSPZ.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Hey!  He's the biggest dumbass in town. 
[01:49:30]  Spaz Radio.  All right.  Hey!  Hey, we got to take a break.  Do we have to?  The political commentary is next.  I can't wait.  And right after Spaz Radio, we're going to debut two more songs for the Most Offensive Song  Contest.  Mm-hmm.  If Psycho Mark's around listening to the show, I need him to come in here and edit this one  song so we can get it on the radio.  I'm Horny for Little Girls by Q.  What has to be taken out?  Twat and hiney.  Hiney.  Yeah.  Because of the context they are using.  You can say twat. 
[01:50:00]  You can say hiney.  But, yeah, you can't use them in the context of the song.  No.  Not at all.  So we'll clean up the song, make it airable.  The last break of Spaz Radio next and more of your phone calls and feedback.  Yeah.  212-757-1027 is our phone line.  Opie.  You're scum.  And Anthony.  Your new name is Dick.  Opie and Anthony.  What changed you into such a demonic little bastard?  1-0-7-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-7-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-6-7-6-6-6-6-6. 
[01:50:30]  Hey, this is Jim Brewer and I've been up since like, oh, I don't know, yesterday.  And the only thing that gets me going, Hammer, is Opie and Anthony.  I'm talking 1027.  And the W Hammer.  I gotta pee.  Brewer, where the hell are you, Brewer?  Yeah.  I have to apologize to him.  I guess we talked about it.  He called.  My voicemail wanted to come in with some beer. 
[01:51:00]  When?  It was a while.  Before we went on vacation, and there was a mix-up.  So we blew off a chance to hang out with him again.  That kind of sucks.  We really, really like him a lot.  He's a pisser, man.  And Psycho Mark went into the other studio with one of the NAW sensors.  Yeah, to clean up, thank heavens for, no, what was it called?  Horny Girls, Little Horny Girls, whatever.  A song we're going to play for the most offensive song contest from Q. 
[01:51:30]  It's good.  It could be in the running, people.  I like it.  Very creative, very offensive.  Yeah.  And we're going to get into that right after this final segment of Spaz Radio.  Spaz Radio is amazing.  Last time I saw people come together in hatred as much as they are against Spaz, it was in  the Frankenstein movie when they had the pitchforks and the torches and were headed toward  the castle.  Yeah.  That's how they feel towards Spaz.  Yes.  It's amazing. 
[01:52:00]  Ant, the New Jersey Devils check in.  Okay, the Devils.  Yeah.  Didn't realize they were fans of the show, but thanks, guys.  We would like to donate some hockey equipment to Spaz so he doesn't hit his head anymore.  A helmet.  Jesus Christ himself checking in, Anthony, from Nazareth.  Very good.  I'm going back on my cross from listening to the Spaz Radio.  Screw being your savior.  You're all a lost cause.  Wow.  Everything that has happened in history, and that's what put him over the edge. 
[01:52:30]  And put him back on the cross.  Bud Dwyer checking in.  Remember our Bud Dwyer?  Yes.  ONA, hi.  After hearing this, just shot myself again.  I guess he's had enough.  All right.  He's the biggest dumbass in town.  Spaz Radio.  Woo!  Hey!  Woo!  Woo!  Hey!  Hey!  And, of course, Friday.  Friday, we start the new Spaz segment, Spaz's Week in Review.  Yeah, this is just the preview.  Yes.  Spaz, every week, everything that happens that week in the news will be Spaz's special little 
[01:53:00]  segment.  All right, and back to the tape that he made while we were on vacation.  I guess we missed a few political stories.  Yeah.  And, uh, well, Spaz, uh, he's coming out of a Beastie Boys song, Sabotage, because he  was making a little demo tape for us.  Yeah.  This is a little different, a little different than the segment we're going to start Friday,  which is just Spaz's Week in Review with bumpers and news music behind him. 
[01:53:30]  Being part of this show, right.  All right.  So, here we go.  Spaz.  Sabotage by, uh, the Beastie Boys.  One of my all-time favorite songs, along with No Sleep Till Brooklyn, What You Want, and,  uh, Fight for Your Right to Party.  But it's, uh, enough of the party, because now it's time for the very serious political  talk.  Very serious.  I'm going to be on WSPZ, the only show to be here on Saturday nights. 
[01:54:00]  And, uh, my little political commentary is going to be sparked by a little article I read  in the paper about Mayor Giuliani commenting on the latest shooting of an unarmed black  man, the third in 13 months.  And Giuliani is...  Gotta get that average up, right, Spaz?  Mm-hmm.  Jesus.  Let's just start from here.  Racial, uh, shootings, yes.  Yes.  Of course.  Spaz.  And Giuliani is, everybody knows, is a babbling idiot anyway, from time to time. 
[01:54:30]  He's a huge forehead that talks at the TV screen.  Pot, the kettle for you.  Wait, what'd you say about his head?  I said it takes up half the television screen.  Oh.  His head.  His head.  Oh!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  And every shot it takes up half the TV screen?  Yeah.  TV screen?  For most.  Yeah.  He's got a huge forehead.  Mm-hmm.  Wouldn't that depend on, uh, the camera guy zooming in or out? 
[01:55:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  But his head is that big.  But he has one of these strange heads that, no matter what angle they're shooting, it's  always going to be half the TV screen?  It's rhetorical.  It's a rhetorical head.  I was just trying to make a joke.  Yeah.  Sorry.  It's just a joke.  Just a joke.  It's a little joke.  See?  It's a little joke.  Right.  And he's a very, very confused man.  And he made very, very confused statements, which...  What were you talking about there, Zbass? 
[01:55:30]  Giuliani.  Well, looking in a mirror, what?  Okay.  I guess they're expected by the man.  Anyway, he says that there's a legitimate cause of concern for some people.  And he continued on his weekly radio program to say that the shooting was for political exploitation.  He says sometimes it's hard to distinguish between those who have legitimate concerns and the exploiters.  He continued on to say that I want to assure you that I do distinguish between the two. 
[01:56:00]  He continued, I realize there are legitimate causes for concern.  I also realize that there is a very, very well orchestrated, politically orchestrated situation here.  Once again, Rudy makes no sense.  What?  What?  Oh, my God.  Why doesn't Rudy make sense?  Rudy doesn't make sense.  Rudy.  That quote made no sense at all.  Well, with you saying it, I got to agree. 
[01:56:30]  I didn't really understand it.  I read it over and over again, and it absolutely made no sense, so I thought I'd pick on it.  Was he saying, now, just by, just from what you said, it sounds like what he was saying was some people voice concern over these shootings,  not because they're actually concerned.  They do it for political reasons.  Yes.  Okay, that's not that out there.  That could have been summed up very quickly, concisely.  That's a statement that makes sense.  Right.  Whether it's true or false, you could decipher it. 
[01:57:00]  But in my opinion, he did not word it correctly.  How should he have worded it?  Wait, please, never do that when I have a mouthful of coffee.  It almost came out of my nose.  It was this close.  All right, so how should he have worded that statement?  I think the way Anthony just put it was fine.  It made sense.  But the way he put it, he said it was orchestrated, comma, politically orchestrated.  I mean, it's redundant.  The way he said it.  Or rhetorical? 
[01:57:30]  Or rhetoric?  Let's move on.  Spaz Radio.  Do we have some options next?  You did some scuba diving, right?  Do you have any oxygen tanks in the office that I can maybe breathe in real deeply?  I think I need oxygen.  I can't tell.  I do have a fainting.  I do have Valium, though.  This is just golden.  Okay, let's move on.  And his dyke political adversary, Hillary Rodham Clinton, accused the mayor of leading to rest judgment in the case. 
[01:58:00]  Okay, listen, Spaz, you are trying to learn from us.  Yeah.  Okay, if you're going to make a statement that she's a dyke, you've got to kind of say, like, allegedly or something.  You could get sued for that.  In joking fashion, so that if you had to come to the defense of your statement, you could say, if you listen to it in the context that was stated, it was obviously a joke.  It was obviously done in jest.  The way you're doing it, you're talking like a newscaster here. 
[01:58:30]  You're talking like you're doing the news and editorializing, and you are indeed saying that she is a dyke.  When we say it, well, we do say she's a dyke-o.  Now, when we say it, it's a goofy show.  You could tell.  You know, the Opie and Anthony show, a dopey show.  You don't go to CNN for a dick joke.  You don't come here for your hard-hitting news.  You don't see Tom Brokaw calling Hillary Clinton a big fat guy.  Hillary Rodham Clinton, a big bull dyke.  Tonight on NBC Nightly News, we interview the rug shawar and ask her, how does she like it? 
[01:59:00]  Wood floor, pool rack full of afro hair, or the two-finger mohawk?  Tonight on NBC Nightly News, exclusive interview, Hillary Dyke Rodham Clinton.  So, you never hear Tom Brokaw saying it.  No.  Okay.  So, this is your commentary on the dick, Hillary Clinton?  Yes.  Allegedly.  Allegedly. 
[01:59:30]  Hillary Rodham Clinton accused the mayor of leading to rush judgment in the case of the third fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man in 13 months.  Rudy Giuliani.  And, of course, Reverend Al Sharpe didn't know how to make more comments.  As he usually does, sticking his fat, pudgy face in front of the cameras once again, to say, no, J.C.'s, no, peace, whatever, blah, blah, blah, blah, in New York.  He says every time he gets on the TV, which is when police brutality happens.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[02:00:00]  I'm dying over here.  I'm dying over here.  I think I'm having a heart attack.  Look, I can't finish this show.  I'm dying over here.  I'm listening to Spence.  I think I'm having a heart attack.  Oh!  I'm listening to the words.  I can't finish.  I'm dying over here.  Okay.  Holy smoke.  Tom, on line seven, the clue train is coming by. 
[02:00:30]  Hop on, Spence.  It's like a Scrabble truck overturned on the highway and words just are flying all over the road.  And I'm assuming you have a little problem with what he just said.  I don't know what he just said.  He's talking about Hillary and then he goes, oh, Rudy.  And then he's talking about Reverend Al and every time police brutality things come up there, then.  I don't know.  It doesn't sound like you're thought out. 
[02:01:00]  He sticks his fat, pudgy face in front of the TV cameras.  Fat, pudgy face.  That's factual.  And Star Jones checking in.  Oh, Star.  From The View.  Can I eat spaz?  He goes right to the boobs, you know.  O.J. Simpson checking in.  Yeah.  Got a knife?  Spaz's teacher checking in.  I had to get a special stamp made for when I graduated spaz's, great, excuse me, graded spaz's papers. 
[02:01:30]  It was, okay, pathetic.  WCBS checking in, Ant.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Cousin Brucey just dropped dead listening to spaz's radio.  And, wow, look at this.  He took the time out, Christopher Reeve, to type something, I guess.  I don't know how he does that, but Christopher Reeve, spaz, you can ride my horse any time. 
[02:02:00]  King Gimp checking in once again from the Oscars.  King Gimp.  We love King Gimp.  Spaz, I think you're my son.  Hey, Ant.  You're not going to believe this, but Stevie Wonder is checking in.  How does he write?  He writes, please, God, take my hearing, too.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, horrific.  Horrific.  Wow!  All right.  Holy smoke.  I am dying.  I'm dying. 
[02:02:30]  I'm having a heart attack.  I'd like to finish the show, but I'm dying over here.  All right.  Are we done with the Reverend Al?  I don't know where we are on the tape.  We're coming to a close.  Coming to a close.  It is Reverend Al commentary, Anthony.  Okay.  Anyway.  So that is that, and that leads us to the Senate race between the dyke and the guy with the huge forehead.  Let me tell you what you're getting here, folks.  You're going to tell us what we're getting.  All right.  Okay.  Everybody might want to take notes. 
[02:03:00]  Take out your notepads because the election is coming up, election day, and you might want to refer back to spaz.  Sure.  Here we go.  You got Rudy Giuliani with a big forehead.  And that hairstyle he has.  He's got a lisp.  He babbles on like an idiot from time to time.  He doesn't support the police all that well, even though he is their boss.  And he's a Yankee fan, which is a minus. 
[02:03:30]  Definite minus.  He'll...  All right.  Well, those are the issues I look into when I want to see...  Spaz, you're a registered voter, I'm assuming?  Not at the moment.  Thank God.  And those are the reasons why you would vote for Rudy, G.  No, I would...  See, what politicians look for, and I explain this later on...  All right, no, no, no, we'll get to it.  If it's something on the tape, then don't explain it now.  Okay, we'll get to it.  All I'm saying is that that's what he... 
[02:04:00]  But you pretty much have a problem with Rudy's presence.  Yes, his appearance.  The way he presents himself on the television.  So you think he's stupid because he has a lisp and funny hair?  I just think that he doesn't know where...  He doesn't have all of his marbles together.  He doesn't know where his head is a lot of the times.  And in case in point, he just backed off the Brooklyn Museum issue.  I mean, if the guy's going to be mayor and hopefully...  Well, not hopefully, because I wouldn't vote for the guy.  But if he is going to be our next senator, he's got to have a pair of balls. 
[02:04:30]  Oh!  Oh, B.  All right, wait, wait, wait.  You don't think Rudy...  The one thing Rudy G. does have, whether you like him or hate him, is a set of balls.  But he backed off at the Brooklyn Museum.  How did he back off?  He just gave in.  He said, I'll give you the $5.8 million, and I won't argue with you anymore about a piece of art.  And the guy cannot take...  I think I...  I'm not a huge Rudy fan, but I respect him for backing down on that issue.  Because he was totally wrong on that issue.  He was totally wrong.  It's a freedom of speech issue.  Mm-hmm.  You know? 
[02:05:00]  I just don't...  I don't think he presents himself on that.  Freedom of speech.  Freedom of expression, I should say.  Angelina Jolie checking in.  Yeah.  Uh, I make out with my brother because I'm afraid all men are as stupid as fans.  Okay, let's move on.  Uh, are we...  Oh, no, now this is your...  Uh, what you think of, uh, the dyke Hillary Clinton.  Allegedly, of course.  Do you have Hillary Clinton, who is, uh...  A dyke or a politically correct saying she's a carpetbagger? 
[02:05:30]  And, uh...  What?  A carpetbagger.  So you were being politically correct by...  Instead of calling her a dyke, you wanted to call her a carpetbagger?  Well, I was actually going more towards the slang.  Yeah, what is a carpetbagger?  A carpet muncher.  She carpet...  You know, carpet meaning like the, uh, the hair down there.  But when they refer to her as a carpetbagger, they're not referring to her being a dyke.  There is a saying that is a carpetbagger, is what, what they, uh, were saying. 
[02:06:00]  Carpetbagger is not the same as a dyke?  No.  No, that's a rug.  Holy mother of pearl.  No.  No, carpetbagger.  A carpet muncher is an expression used for someone that you assume is a lesbian.  Okay.  A carpetbagger is a political term that means, Spaz?  No clue.  Oh, my God.  I, I, I... 
[02:06:30]  Uh, Anthony, Ronald Reagan checking in.  Yes.  You know how they have to list, uh, from what town?  Yes.  A piece of feedback?  It, uh, it says from, I don't remember.  Well, I don't.  I'm glad I will not remember this later.  But I...  Spaz is a great American.  Of course, uh, um, the week in review with Spaz.  Mr. Spaz, tear down that rhetorical.  Uh, Ed.  Or, or Mr. Reagan. 
[02:07:00]  Yes.  Of course, we're doing, uh, the week in review with Spaz starting this Friday.  With that said, Dr. Kevorkian checking in.  Uh, he would like to be a guest on Friday's show as well.  Book him.  Okay.  Hook down fun.  Give us 20 years and we, and we'll do what we can for Spaz.  All right.  See, a carpetbagger, she's not from New York.  Yeah.  So she's kind of like packing her bags and settling in New York just to get the, the set 
[02:07:30]  at sea.  Oh, yeah.  And that's what a carpet bagger is.  She'll pick up and move somewhere and say she's from that place, you know.  Okay.  Wearing the Yankee hat and then Met hat.  Okay.  So she's both a carpet bagger and a carpet muncher.  Very good.  According to you.  Yes.  All right.  Here we go.  Back to Hillary.  Hillary Clinton, who is a dyke or politically correct to say she's a carpet bagger.  Snorting.  And she can't decide whether she's a Yankee fan or Met fan, which shows that she's very indecisive. 
[02:08:00]  And what else can I say about her?  Oh, yeah.  She backs down from whatever she says.  Like in the Amadou Diallo case, she said one thing.  And then later on, when she got flack from it, she said another thing.  So which means she's not using the balls that she has.  Was that meant as a joke?  I think Spaz, because that's pretty good.  It kind of worked. 
[02:08:30]  Yes.  It's a new account.  Yeah.  See, Arthur knows.  That was funny.  I don't think she ever wore a Met hat, though, Spaz.  I think she...  No, I believe in the Subway series, she actually switched them off.  Oh, okay.  You may be right about that.  Because after all, she's been president for the past eight years because she wears the pants  to the new Clinton family.  Ah.  I would think.  Anyway.  Try not to.  You'll hurt yourself.  So, that's the Senate race. 
[02:09:00]  Pick and choose who you want, people.  That's basically what you're getting.  That's it.  Politics...  Politics is bad.  See, in the political world in Washington, D.C., we have people there who are not in it  for the people, the masses, the people who they govern.  They're in it for their money, for the pockets they have aligned on themselves.  Wow.  Whoa.  Explain yourself. 
[02:09:30]  The pockets they have aligned for themselves.  Yes.  What I meant was that politicians don't give a crap about the country or about the masses  that they govern.  They're only in there to put the money in their pockets from the lobbyists that work for them.  So, you meant to say lining their pockets.  Lining their pockets.  And not the pockets that they're aligned with.  Well, they're aligned...  I'm aligning myself with the pockets.  That's my running mate.  A big pocket.  No, they're... 
[02:10:00]  You know, most people like to align themselves with a party or a position or a platform.  I'm aligning myself with pockets.  Look at this one.  It's a big cargo pocket.  I could fit a whole wallet in there.  Look at this little one with a zipper for my cigarettes.  Well, they align themselves with the people with the most money.  The pockets.  Pockets have all the money.  Well, where's the money, Opie?  Where do people keep their money? 
[02:10:30]  In their pockets.  That's why I'm with the pockets.  Someone shoot me in the skull.  Yeah.  The KKK.  We've been looking for a representative in New York,  but I'm not so sure we can trust him to light the crosses.  All right.  Wow.  In the political world in Washington, D.C.,  we have people there who are not in it for the people, the masses,  the people who they govern. 
[02:11:00]  They're in it for their money,  for the pockets they have aligned on themselves.  Whatever money they can get,  that's what they're there for.  Wow!  See, in Washington, D.C., you have lobbyists.  What lobbyists do is that they influence  the person in office to go along with either side of an issue,  because every issue has two sides.  If one side offers more money than the other,  then they will tell their senator or whatever,  go for the person with the more money,  even though it may not be a moral decision to make. 
[02:11:30]  Like, let's say,  we've got people who want cancerous live wire lines.  They'll have a plate.  Wait a minute.  It has left this station.  Wait a minute.  It's very rare when I laugh so hard I start snorting.  Congratulations, Spaz.  You got me to that point.  Oh!  Oh, wait.  Let's back up.  There are so many things right there.  Cancerous live wires. 
[02:12:00]  That's like giant mosquitoes.  What's a cancerous live wire?  Dude, I think he means the high-tension wires,  the high-voltage lines around residential areas  that haven't been proven this,  but it might cause cancer.  Yeah.  I don't think you refer to them as cancerous liars.  Like the wires have tumors dripping off of them.  God damn, I've got to hear that again.  I think I backed it up to that point. 
[02:12:30]  Here we go.  On themselves.  Whatever money they can get,  that's what they're there for.  See, in Washington, D.C., you have lobbyists.  Well, lobbyists do is that they influence the person in office  to go along with either side of an issue,  because every issue has two sides.  If one side offers more money than the other,  then they will tell their senator or whatever,  go for the person with the more money,  even though it may not be a moral decision to make.  Okay, terrific.  Like, let's say they've got people who want cancerous live wire limes. 
[02:13:00]  You want cancerous live wire limes?  Hello.  I'm against the cancerous live wire limes.  It's benign cancerous live wire.  Ask not what cancerous live liars can do for you.  Ask what you can do for cancerous live liars.  I propose by the end of this decade, 
[02:13:30]  we will go to cancerous live liars on the moon.  Ever.  That's not what your country can do for you.  They're going to blockade those cancerous live liars  until they send those missiles back to Moscow.  Cancerous live liars and giant mosquitoes.  We're in danger here in the city.  I'm frightened to get people who want cancerous live wire limes 
[02:14:00]  all over the place in a small town in Florida.  We have people who oppose it because it causes cancer.  More money is given to the senator by the people who want the paralyzed  than he's going to go with that.  It's just the way it happens.  So politicians suck.  They blow.  They're in it for the money.  They're not in it for the people who they're supposed to govern.  And we elect these people.  So keep that in mind when the election year comes up every year,  no matter if it's a senator or you're a delegate or whatever people you vote for. 
[02:14:30]  Just keep that in mind.  Politicians out there, they're screwed.  They kiss babies, look great on television, comb their hair, brush their teeth, whatever.  Look great.  Say what the people want to hear.  Get elected.  And then they do crap for the country  because they're only in there to get the money  and cheat on their husbands or wives.  I have a dream, a cancerous live wife,  of being the promised land. 
[02:15:00]  And every politician cheats on their wife?  I believe so, yes.  Read my lips.  No cancerous live liars.  Mr. Gorbachev, get rid of those cancerous live lives.  It's like a horror movie.  In a small town, cancerous live wires.  From the mind of spaz, it's cancerous live wires. 
[02:15:30]  How will you defend your family against cancerous live wires?  Coming to theaters this Friday.  Anthony, Christopher Reeves checking in once again.  For the love of God, someone pull my plug.  There he goes. 
[02:16:00]  Threw himself down the stairs.  All right.  I believe the last 30 seconds of spaz's blog commentary, Anthony.  They want to do infidelity in line pockets  to become a thief and a whore.  Don't go into...  Wait, maybe we need to back it up so we understand what...  You need a running start for these.  All right, where are we?  Let me see here, Anthony.  Whatever.  Look, great.  Say what the people want to hear. 
[02:16:30]  Get elected, and then they do crap for the country  because they're only in there to get the money  and cheat on their husbands or wives.  They want to do infidelity in line pockets  to become a thief and a whore.  Don't go into political offices  and screen a country for your own needs and games.  Anyway, that's K-Dog's political commentary.  You can get it every Saturday night on WSBZ.  And as we leave you,  because it is time to go,  leave you a pun.  I like to leave it a pun every week.  Here is Ozzy Osbourne.  Mama, I'm coming home.  And Mama, I'm coming home. 
[02:17:00]  So, I hope you saved dinner for me.  Anyway, listen to the K-Dog Show next week,  8 o'clock Saturday night.  Put some strychnine in it.  I'll see you there.  Wow.  All right, let's just let that soak in for a minute here.  What were you trying to say at the end there  with the pockets and the thief and the whores?  I was saying that if people want to become politicians  to align their pockets with money,  which is what they do,  and to cheat on their husbands and wives, 
[02:17:30]  then don't go into politics  and screw over the country  for your own needs and gains,  just become a thief and a whore.  I shall not seek,  nor shall I accept  your nomination  for cancerous live life.  Anthony, the advertising manager for Trojans  is checking in.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He wants to use spaz on a billboard  with a picture of a condom 
[02:18:00]  over a caption that reads,  if you don't use one of these,  you'll have one of these.  Whoa!  Hey!  Wow.  The celebrities just came out in droves  talking about spaz.  Well, let's go to Ryan from Huntington.  The monkeys at the Bronx Zoo  who threw their crap at people  have a higher IQ than spaz.  Jim from Westchester.  Hey, guys.  Turn on the news.  The teachers at Iona College  are committing a fast suicide. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, this just in.  Spaz, you sound great.  Your mentor, Ken Dashow.  I just want to say this.  You won't have cancerous live liars  to kick around anymore.  Well, we've got to end spaz radio 
[02:19:00]  with the jingle.  Yeah.  Where is it?  Till Friday.  Is it Friday already?  Jesus Christ.  He's the biggest dumbass in town.  Whoa!  Spaz radio.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Hey!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Hey!  Hey!  Ha!  Whoa!  Ha!  Whoa!  Hey!  Hey! 
[02:19:30]  Okay.  Terrific.  Okay.  Horrific.  See, there's a small percentage  of people out there  that think like spaz is,  you know,  making, you know,  that is a put-on or something.  Oh, yeah.  I cannot assure you enough.  And you can't,  no,  I don't even think  there's that many people  that think that  because you can't  just put this on. 
[02:20:00]  He would win  an Academy Award.  You'd have to give him  an Oscar.  All right, spaz.  So,  this is too good.  That's why we're doing spaz  is we can review  every Friday for a while.  Every Friday.  Any stories you're working on  for the next edition?  Well, we got the  Cuban Raft Boy.  Right.  Okay.  Well, don't  throw the beans on that.  I can't wait to hear.  We can't wait for Friday.  Let me boil this up.  Hey, keep the spook.  Anything else?  Anything else come to mind  as the week rolls on? 
[02:20:30]  Oh, my God.  I'm going to do the Pope.  You have some commentary  on the Pope.  The Pope's visit  to the Holy Land.  And commentary  on a picture I saw  in the Daily News  with the Pope.  Okay.  And I'm going to do  a little,  maybe a little late,  but I'm going to do  a little post-Oscar review.  Oh, that's good.  That's topical.  It was during this week.  Sure, sure.  That's good.  Anything within  the last week is good.  Yeah, that's all  I've gotten  on top of my head  so far.  Write your joke. 
[02:21:00]  Insert joke here.  All right, spaz.  This is how  spaz's weekend review  is going to work,  okay?  Mm-hmm.  We need you to  hit on a bunch of topics.  National news.  Mm-hmm.  Local news.  Mm-hmm.  Entertainment report.  Mm-hmm.  And sports, right?  Sure, whatever, man.  And maybe,  and maybe a little  like human interest.  One of those stories  that have that goofy twist.  Kind of the touchy-feely.  Kind of like the guy  yesterday with the cell phone  and the lion cage thing  you did.  Mm-hmm.  You know,  that is like what's called  human interest.  Something that's a little 
[02:21:30]  off-kilter,  a little wacky.  A little dog  named Snuggles.  Right.  You know,  stuff like that.  So we need you  to hit those topics.  Effing ponderous, man.  We need you to,  we need you  to put the whole thing  together on shortcuts  in the other studio  before the show.  Okay.  Because that's the best  way it works.  To give you your time  by yourself  in a studio  all by yourself  to lay down  your week in review.  Lay it down.  Okay.  How long should it be,  Anthony?  God damn four hours. 
[02:22:00]  What are you kidding me?  However long  it takes,  Spaz,  okay?  Okay.  And we'll do  the first one  Friday,  sometime during the show.  Does someone have  some crack  or crystal meth  or something?  I just gotta boot up  or something.  Wow.  And Mike from Jersey  checking in.  Hey, ONA,  I heard Tom Likas  wants to hire Spaz.  He said Spaz  is the key  to high ratings.  We finally agree  on something,  Mr. Lick-Ass.  George W. Bush 
[02:22:30]  checking in, Ann.  And George W.  Please, Spaz,  don't vote for me.  All right,  so let's hear  for Spaz,  Spaz Radio.  He's the real deal, folks.  That was great, man.  I want you to hear me.  I'm just gonna say  this one more time.  I did not have sex  with that cancerous  live life.  From the top 
[02:23:00]  of the Spaz building.  Someone's gotta  make that immediately.  Yeah.  Just a...  From the top  of the Spaz building.  Spaz Radio.  All right,  kick ass, man.  Wow.  Just when you thought  it couldn't get any better  than what we just did,  Mark,  is the song ready? 
[02:23:30]  Yes.  All right.  Now,  what's the name  of the song by Q?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Some funny-ass song.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  You are laughing  harder than anybody.  We have two new entries  in the Most Offensive  Song Contest.  Yeah.  Remember,  the rules  to the Most Offensive  Song Contest.  Song has to be offensive.  Yeah.  That's it.  And we listened to,  I don't know,  we were all in the back office  at least 20 songs today.  They socked.  There's only two  that made the cut today.  They're coming in  every freaking day, though.  Yeah.  And we encourage you guys 
[02:24:00]  to keep sending them in,  okay?  Try harder.  But how many bleeps  did we have to put in that song?  I think four.  Four?  Really?  Yeah.  I only heard like two.  Maybe three.  No,  it needed fours.  All right.  Heine.  Heine.  Twat.  Heine twat.  Right.  Not on the contest.  Balls twice.  Balls twice.  Balls twice,  Heine in the twat.  No,  we come in a pair,  you know.  But I'm bumped.  Thank you.  That old gag.  Woo!  Thank you, Scott. 
[02:24:30]  So,  we've got to take a break  and we'll play  the two new entries  in the Most Offensive  Song Contest.  Woo!  Woo!  Okay.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Hey!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  And we'll  do that next.  Stay there.  All right,  we're back. 
[02:25:00]  Hey!  Just a couple minutes  away from  two new entries  in the Most Offensive  Song Contest,  Anthony.  We're all trying  to catch our breath here.  I finally got my  composure.  Gotta say,  you guys,  just keeping us  entertained during  the commercial break  with your instant  feedback.  I was dying.  There's hundreds  of them coming in  and you guys  are funny effers,  man.  Funny effers. 
[02:25:30]  Some guy was  driving home  and he saw  the giant mosquito  sitting atop  a cancerous live wire.  He tried to run away  but an FBI agent  sprayed him with DDT.  Well,  you really  got to go back  with this show.  All right.  Let's  invite the  wow guys  in really fast.  All right.  Mark should be  coming in  with the edited  version of  the  I'm Horny  for Little  Girls song  that's just  going to make  you drive  off the road. 
[02:26:00]  But first,  let's say  hi to Mike,  Chris,  and David,  Anthony.  Hey, guys.  Hey, what's up?  What's happening?  The latest  wow guys,  Anthony.  Yes.  Now, of course,  we encourage you  guys to get on  live TV with  the wow signs.  I guess someone  got on Channel  7 last night  with a huge  wow sign.  Yeah.  And you guys  got on what,  TRL?  Yeah.  MTV again?  Yeah.  That's a good one.  Good target.  They hit TRL  on the 14th of  March.  It is a target  rich environment  out there. 
[02:26:30]  TRL is one  that's just been  slammed.  It's like a  German ball bearings  plant.  Always getting  bombed.  Psycho Mark,  you proud of  these guys  or what?  These guys are  great.  These guys are  true professionals.  Hey, guys,  there's your  leader,  Psycho Mark.  Hail,  leader.  The liberator's  always flying high  over TRL.  Hey, are these  guys going to get  the Psycho Mark  psychopath T-shirts?  Yes.  Yes.  Nice.  Very nice.  Two T-shirts  to give out.  And all you have  to do is get on 
[02:27:00]  live TV with the  wow sign.  Yeah.  Or any sign  associated with the  show.  We really like  wow the best,  but if you want  to get creative,  by all means,  go for it.  We enjoy the  OK Terrifics.  Those are always  fun to see.  Spaz is an idiot.  I'm sure there'll  be a lot of  those popping up.  And all you have  to do is prove  that you were on  TV.  You were the  person that did  it.  You know,  it's going to  be funny watching  a show and  just seeing a sign  that says live  cancerous life.  Cancerous live  lives.  We'll all know  what it means. 
[02:27:30]  We'll have a few  of those signs at  the next road show,  I'm sure.  And you just  come in with the  videotape to prove  that it was you  on live TV.  You come down,  you get to check  out the show.  We give you tons  of stuff.  We get you on  the radio right  there.  Absolutely.  So where are you  guys from,  man?  Hillside.  Hillside?  Hillside?  Cool.  You guys want to  do any shout  outs or anything?  Or shout outs?  Yo.  It's not Hot 97  over here.  Hey.  I like that.  Yeah.  Say hi to my  cousin, my  friends.  All right.  That's cool.  Listen to all  them. 
[02:28:00]  Your girlfriend?  What's your  girlfriend?  Janet.  Janet?  Does she go?  Oh, shit.  Oh, dang.  Whoa!  A couple of  chains.  All right.  Did you guys  enjoy spaz radio?  Oh, definitely.  Yes.  Great stuff.  Classic, isn't  it?  Yes, it is.  They were sitting  out here just  howling.  Yeah.  Absolutely howling.  Hey, would you  like to explain  to the audience  there?  I think he can.  How much are  you packing?  400. 
[02:28:30]  400 pounds.  That's right.  How old are you?  18.  Oh, you're the  guy.  That's right.  We talked to him  before our  vacation.  Yeah.  Wow.  400 pounds.  I got the thong.  I got the thong.  Oh, my God.  That's the thong.  Hey.  All right.  You didn't fit in  that.  You fit in that.  Yep.  Can you put that  on so you get a  picture on the  unofficial website?  I don't care.  You'll do it?  Let's see.  Step into that  thing.  All right.  All right.  I can't believe  he fits in it. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  He's the 400  pound 18-year-old  is stepping  into a thong.  Down.  Down.  Down, pick a truck.  Truck, truck.  Bad luck, boy.  What?  What?  What?  What the hell?  What the hell?  What's looking at your  ass?  Oh, my God.  I'm not Ricky Martin's  best.  Look at that thong.  It's stretched like  the cables on the verrazano bridge.  It's just like, there's quite a lot of tension on those puppies.  Yes, there is.  Wow.  You carry 400 pounds well, I must say.  Thank you. 
[02:29:30]  He's a very fast runner.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Very fast.  Run the mile in about an hour.  Relatively speaking.  You know, I was the last kid in school.  Yeah?  Yeah.  They used to call me in.  Okay, you don't have to finish.  Just come in.  Oh, that guy.  You were that guy.  Like, everyone's jogging.  It's like the last guy.  All right, come on in.  You always try to get the girls that walk, and then they just leave you.  Thank you.  And then you're the last one huffing and puffing.  Do you like being fat?  Does it have a...  Does it have a... 
[02:30:00]  You're not going to see me on, like, one of the talk shows crying because I was tortured  in school or anything.  Yeah, not until they've got to pull you out of the side of the house with a corklift.  Yeah, you don't want that.  My nickname will become, like, Hambone or something.  Yeah.  You don't want to do that.  You don't want Teamsters removing you from your own house.  No.  Jerry, I've lived in existence in my room.  Like, Jabba the Hutt.  You know, you don't want that.  We might have found the next fat comedian.  Yeah, pretty funny.  You got some chops to do.  Say, show me, planet! 
[02:30:30]  Is there any advantages to being this overweight there?  What's your name?  Because you're one of...  You're Mike, okay.  Scared people of me.  They don't bother me.  No, I bet.  I don't have any people walking up to me.  That's good.  You seem pretty cool.  You seem confident.  Yep.  You know?  Seems like no one's going to mess with you.  Man, I guess so.  But, I mean, God.  Do you have any plans on maybe shedding some of that?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Eventually.  How much does your brother weigh?  No, I was nervous.  I don't have a brother.  Oh, okay.  I was like, yeah, I have a sister.  You ate a bit, didn't you? 
[02:31:00]  She's just as big as me.  You have a sister that's big as you?  Yeah, not really.  How big is she?  Well, she had a baby, so that's why she's big, but...  A baby?  She's not like 400 pounds.  She's like, get in my belly.  You look like a baby.  Get in my belly.  You look like a baby.  Come here, wee man.  And how much...  I've got a turtle head perking out.  And how much does she weigh now? 
[02:31:30]  She's about probably like...  A ton?  300.  Oh.  A quarter of a ton, maybe.  Wow.  And like, what, your whole life?  Pretty plump?  Yeah.  Maybe when I was like about a minute old.  A minute old.  It's like growing by the second.  I have to get stuck formula in my mouth, and then I was hooked.  I got the pregnant.  That was pretty funny.  We've got to play the feud!  So, what do you have for breakfast, Mike?  Yeah.  Normal.  You know, whatever's in the fridge. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah?  Normal for you might be normal for everybody else.  No, Twinkies.  I don't know.  We've got to do bad times here.  What's Twinkies?  Yeah.  Yeah, you've got to watch that.  It seems like your buddies are cool to you, though, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  What are they going to do?  They'll kill them.  Look at them.  I'll turn them into puddles.  How's the chick situation?  Oh, all friends to me.  Nothing that intimate.  See, that's what happens. 
[02:32:30]  You're like the lovable fat guy.  We've got to get a...  Like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.  We've got to get the 400-pound 18-year-old to bang it.  Oh, God.  We've got to play a new game, gentlemen.  Who wants to bang a 400-pound kid?  Come on!  Where's the inappropriate, though, when you need it?  There you go.  There you go, man.  Hey, Mitch, on line four wants to ask you, when was the last time you ate?  Before I came here.  I had a nice long walk up here. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, man.  Never again.  Nice long walk into the elevator.  My town's like two miles.  I walk like 18, coming up here from 33rd Street.  Yeah.  You walked all the way from 33rd.  Yeah.  So you're feeling a little thin right now.  Yeah, I am.  Probably shut off like five pounds.  I wish.  Five pounds?  Yeah, I wish.  That's a good start, maybe.  You think we could get him a banging?  Probably.  Probably.  He should be the stack of two guy over here.  I don't know.  I think he needs a stack of four. 
[02:33:30]  You've got to burn a lot more than fat.  Wow.  You know, you ought to do something, though.  I mean, just the fact that we can't afford to lose any listeners.  Yeah, we need listeners.  Every day we tell them.  You know, you're 18 and stuff.  It might seem like, eh, you know, only old fat people croak.  But, you know, you've got to watch that.  Let's ask his buddies, Chris and David, does he eat a lot?  No, I eat more than him.  Yeah.  You eat more than him?  And how much do you weigh?  I weigh 195.  Yeah.  What is it?  Like, what? 
[02:34:00]  It's metabolism.  I have a slow metabolism.  Slow metabolism.  Not a slow jaw, though.  Yeah.  Chewing that food.  Like a wood chipper.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pencil sharpener.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  You're not the guy at lunch at school and stuff with the tray packed with stuff?  Extra fries.  I remember some guy at my elementary school.  He was huge.  I mean, probably, like, bigger than you.  Damn.  Yeah.  And he used to carry the tray with one hand, and it was just piled with food. 
[02:34:30]  And then those little pintings of milk would be lined up his arm.  Like, from his hand, I swear, his hand all the way up his arm.  That's his name.  What was his name?  Eric Caffiro.  And he lost the weight.  He came in, like, junior high the next year over the summer.  He shed so much weight.  We're like, who the hell is this?  And he felt good about himself.  And he got hit by a bus or something.  I'm kidding about that.  But, you know, you ought to do something.  Are you that guy, though?  You pack out?  Yeah.  I can't believe you eat a normal meal. 
[02:35:00]  It's not like I splurge.  What do you eat?  What's breakfast for you?  You know, if there's, like, eggs or something, I'll have, like, eggs, toast, whatever.  Eggs, the chicken it came out of?  What?  Go to McDonald's and wipe them out.  Ask for everything on the menu or something.  You eat fast food a lot?  Yeah.  Yeah, see, that's not good.  Yeah, but I'm telling you, part of it is hereditary because there's no way I could get that big.  There's no way.  If I ate 24 hours a day, I would not get up to 400 pounds.  No.  Is parents skinny as hell?  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  Is parents skinny?  Yeah.  What about, like, grandparents?  Does it run in that?  They're skinny.  My mom started, yeah.  I don't know.  I don't remember any of them.  Those cancer wires.  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  Mosquito picked them up and took them off.  Spaz is a man.  Whoever that is.  I'll throw on the cancer's wires.  Anthony, Richard Simmons checking in today.  All right.  Please have the fat kid eat spaz.  Spaz getting in my belly.  That's like an appetizer for me. 
[02:36:00]  Let's see.  Anthony on line two wants to know, when was the last time you saw your junk?  I don't know.  A while ago.  That's got to suck, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, we've got to get him a bang.  And look at him.  Who's here?  Are you like desperate or something?  Yeah.  Don't be shy about it.  Don't be shy.  Don't say, you know, don't try to be the man.  You know, I'm not desperate.  Look, when was the last time?  Never.  Okay.  Yeah, I know.  Never.  That's desperate.  That's desperate. 
[02:36:30]  I never had it, so I wouldn't be desperate, because I don't know what it's like.  Oh, believe me.  Just imagining that is enough.  Please.  We all know about that.  Maybe like some sick fetish.  So, I don't know.  There's probably some.  I know there's guys out there that are chubby chases for chicks.  Maybe there's a chick that's a chubby chaser for a guy.  Yeah.  Seems like a cool guy.  He's the best.  Yeah.  He's the best.  How do you know?  All right.  I've been friends with him since we were in...  For how many pounds?  Since I was about five pounds, ten pounds. 
[02:37:00]  Five pounds.  I'd say he was about 15 pounds in, like, first grade.  I was about 45.  Yeah.  I like this Mike kid.  It's pretty funny.  Yeah.  All right.  Listen, we're going to have to take a break.  You guys get out.  I thought he didn't hit you in the head with a whiskey box.  Never.  That's funny.  It's a comedy.  It's a comedy.  It's a tragedy into comedy.  I just went down there and smoked his spliff.  I learned it from you, okay, dude?  I have the permanent munchies.  That's why I'm big.  Yeah.  Ah, you smoked the weed?  Nah.  A little bit?  Nah.  A little bit back in the 60s, you know, the parents. 
[02:37:30]  Back in the 60s.  What, pounds?  When you were a kid?  All right, man.  All right.  You guys are pretty cool.  Yeah.  And thanks for wowing on MTV, TRL, a couple weeks ago.  Anytime.  And you guys hang out for the rest of the show?  Who knows?  We might get a lady to bang you there, Mike.  Yeah.  We'll probably wear it out over the cancerous live wires.  Hope I don't smother her.  Maybe she'll die.  Have you guys been...  Have you guys been keeping track of the most offensive song content?  Yes.  Okay.  Kill a Fetus, I think that's the best.  Yeah, Kill a Fetus is the best? 
[02:38:00]  Yeah.  What about you guys?  All in agreement?  Baby Raper.  Baby Raper.  Very catchy.  Very catchy.  What about the KKK man?  Oh, yeah.  That's good, too.  I never heard of FBA, so...  FBA.  Brutal.  That was like an exhibition song.  Yeah.  That started the whole thing.  Can't wait to hear the new stuff we got.  Oh, yeah.  We got two new ones.  I heard you guys welling in here.  Debut next.  One is okay and one is...  Ha!  Oh, very funny.  One could be in the running.  Yeah.  I think so.  Catchy.  You'll be humming this one.  So you guys...  Humming this one, picking your kids up from the nursery. 
[02:38:30]  You guys could hang out, check out the songs with us, and give your opinions, okay?  Go sit on the lesbian couch out there and enjoy.  I'm sitting on it.  That's good, yeah.  You're sitting right on there, huh?  As long as you guys' splooges in all over it.  And how about the table?  You see the glass table?  Yeah, sorry.  I know what we're going to use that for.  Oh, boy.  The girl's going to come in and take a crunch on it.  Nice.  With somebody underneath, some lucky winner.  All right, guys.  All right.  It's Mike.  Thanks a lot.  Thanks a lot.  It's Mike, Chris, and David.  Thanks, man.  And you're going to hook them up with some great stuff, right? 
[02:39:00]  All right.  Give them some valuable prizes.  All right, quick break, and we'll do the latest entries in the Most Defensive Song Contest right after these.  A gigantic room box is coming down the street.  Hand me the RPG-7.  Bobby and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Ah, Anthony, remember Mickey J?  Mickey J.  Yeah.  That was my pal. 
[02:39:30]  I remember him from the old BAB days.  He was considered the mayor of Montauk.  Yeah.  He was on my old radio show all the time.  He was a nut.  Well, I've gotten a bunch of e-mail from people that remember him from the old days.  Uh-oh.  Wait a minute.  You're talking a little weird.  And they say that Mickey J. passed on Anthony.  Oh, no.  How did it happen?  I guess he went swimming. 
[02:40:00]  No, really?  Uh, this past 4th of July.  Oh.  And, uh, Mickey J. never swam.  Oh, no.  And the rumor is he has passed on.  And I've been trying to confirm it, but, uh, I haven't gotten an answer yet.  It's not.  I hope it's not true, because the guy...  I love him.  The guy was a character.  Give my condolences.  All right, listen.  Cut it out.  He was my pal, you ass.  All right, Anthony.  Um, we got a couple new entries in the Most Defensive Song Contest. 
[02:40:30]  Yes.  Finally, some worthy of air.  We've, uh, listened to at least 30 songs in the last two days.  Mm-hmm.  Most of them went right into the garbage.  Yeah.  Hardly.  I'm sorry, but the bar has been, uh, raised to a level that is going to be hard to match.  Right, Ant?  Absolutely.  And, uh, a good way to get your song on the air is make it so we can hear the words.  That would be appreciative.  How many of these did we get?  It's like, wow, you might have been laughing recording this, but, you know, you can't understand 
[02:41:00]  a word you're saying.  It doesn't have to be good, musically.  It's just got to be offensive, and we've got to be able to hear it.  We've slam dunked so many songs into the, uh, wastebasket.  Oh, we're two seconds into hearing them.  Yeah.  When we hear that...  Oh, great.  The guy decided to put the distortion all over his guitar, the vocals. 
[02:41:30]  What is he doing?  All right.  So...  So we can hear it.  These songs are an example of, uh, being able to hear it, being offensive.  Yeah.  The song you're going to play, um, barely made the cut.  I'm going to be honest with you.  Yeah.  See, the other ones were so utterly bad that this one actually squeaked by.  Barely.  Not going to lie.  Barely.  Lie to our listeners.  It's really not that good.  You can hear it.  This is kind of, uh, the warm-up song to the one we're going to play in about five minutes 
[02:42:00]  called I'm Horny for Little Girls, which I think...  That's a good one.  ...which I think could be in the running.  It's a contender, Rock.  It's definitely a contender.  Yeah.  But the one we want to play right now...  Oh, sucks monkey ass.  Well, it's a...  No, no.  It's a song called, uh, Newborn Baby Soup.  Ah!  And, uh, they wrote us a letter, Anthony.  Yeah.  The guys in the band.  Dear O&A, Newborn Baby Soup is our entry in the most offensive song content.  Dear Casey.  Right.  I am equally proud and horrified that I was able to write a song such as this, and I have 
[02:42:30]  you sick F's to thank for it.  Anyway, in for a penny, in for a pound.  The name of the band is WA, which stands for We're All of Us Going to Hell.  We're All of Us Going to Hell.  That would be the dumbest thing I've heard all day if we didn't do Spaz Radio.  I was going to say, is Spaz the leader of this band?  The name of the band is WA.  There is no actual pronunciation of the name.  Rather, it's the sound made by the surprise cake on the Little Rascals episode.  Really?  WA. 
[02:43:00]  Okay.  WA is Attila the Pun on lead vocals.  Billy Caligula on lead guitar.  Jackie Ripper on rhythm guitar.  Very funny.  Al Hitler on bass.  And Genghis Bong on drums.  We would be honored to play at your next road show.  That is if lightning doesn't strike us dead first.  So with that, Anthony, please hang on for the next one, but this is the warm-up, okay? 
[02:43:30]  All right.  This is Newborn Baby Soup by Wheat Walk.  Newborn Baby Soup by Wheat Walk.  Yeah.  We deliver kegels.  Newborn Baby Soup by Wheat Walk.  Newborn Baby Soup by Wheat Walk.  It's a special recipe, I really like it hot  When I'm feeling hungry, I'd rather go to school  Then I get a later and I'm taking a monkey tune 
[02:44:00]  New for baby soup, new for baby soup  A little cold pepper, then it's too good  New for baby soup, new for baby soup  And then a little later, look what I'm going to do  First you take a baby, it's time to sell  A little neck, hang it by its two toes  And drain it on the deck  Drop it in a boiling pot, the vegetables on earth  Where did I get this recipe, I learned it from the Serbs 
[02:44:30]  New for baby soup, new for baby soup  A little cold pepper, then it's too good  New for baby soup, new for baby soup  Then a little later, look what I'm going to do  New for baby soup, new for baby soup  People think I'm crazy, my patients have a strange  But every newborn baby is potentially insane  You lack a older baby, to me that's just a bore  I would rather boil it up and suck it through a strong 
[02:45:00]  New for baby soup, new for baby soup  A little cold pepper, then it's too good  New for baby soup, new for baby soup  And then a little later, look what I'm going to do  New for baby soup, new for baby soup  You're the two  New for baby soup, new for baby soup  I'm going to do your poop  Okay, terrific 
[02:45:30]  That's that  Yeah, okay  New newborn baby soup  Newborn baby soup  By Wah  A lot of people already checking in saying the song is horrible  Song is horrible  This was the best one we got since we went away on vacation  Until this next song was handed to us during the show today, Anthony  I think they, Nick from Elmont checking in, not good enough 
[02:46:00]  Not good, no, no  I think they were concentrating a little too much on the music  Making sure the harmonies are good  Well, it's an example of a song that almost made it  Let's put it that way  I mean, the music was kind of odd  Quality-wise, very good  Quality-wise  Had a catchy little hook  Yeah  They were almost there  They were almost there  Almost, very close  What about the guys, Mike, Chris, and David?  What do you think, guys?  It's all right  It's all right  It sucked  It's a little catchy  See, it sucked  It's all right  But all right isn't going to do it  It's not a winner  Yeah, you're going to 
[02:46:30]  Little country  Little country, yeah  It's not a baby raper, right?  No  You're going to have to gasp when you hear the winner  That's what it is  The winner is going to have to make you go  Oh, my God  Well, let's go to the phones, Anthony  Before we play the next entry  A song called  I'm Horny for Little Girls  Yeah  Danny, what's going on?

Yeah, that was  I tried to get through while you were playing it  To tell you to turn it off  Well, we're giving you an example of some of the stuff we've gotten  That's the best song that we got in the last week and a half  You should have slam dunked that one  That was bad  All right  Well, we got one that's going to make up for that  Trust me  Hey, if you can play the K.K. song  I've never heard that one before

[02:48:00]  I see what she looks like  All right, well, you like fat guys  Yeah  All right  Well, thank you, Ashley  Okay  Yeah, I don't even think we need to go to the phones anymore, Anthony  Yeah, I think, I don't think that one's going to cut it  Newborn baby soup by  Mwah  But thank you for your entry  And thank you for your  I encourage them to send in another entry, though  Yeah  I think they're close, Anthony  Yeah  With a few weeks left in the contest  I think they have what it takes to maybe, you know  Mm-hmm  Do a little better than this  Throw in a little racism, maybe

[02:49:00]  It's the most offensive song contest, Anthony  Right  And the purpose of the most offensive song contest  Is to write the most offensive song  Yes  Which we will judge  Now, you can't win this contest if the song isn't offensive  So that's why we're airing these  Correct  And, of course, we in no way condone the activities that are described in some of these songs  Oh, no  These are not necessarily the ideas of the Opie and Anthony show or any W  Or CBS or Infinity Broadcasting or anybody else

[03:07:00]  You're on the radio  What's up  I was listening to this  Most Offensive Song Contest  And I think  You know  I'm hearing  Most Offensive Song Contest  The song is going to shock  The hell out of me  Yeah  And this thing about  A French guy  You know  Wanting to rape with a girl  It doesn't shock me  That doesn't shock you  No  I expect it  And then I look at  This KKK song  And who doesn't agree  With that song  Oh  I know  It's bad to say  But you know  Who doesn't agree with it  But then you hear a song  Where you know  I'll go on record  I don't agree with it  Thank you Chris 
[03:07:30]  You hear the music  For this other song  And it sounds like  It's going to suck  And then this guy  Starts singing  Baby Raper  I'm laughing my ass  I got to vote  Baby Raper  You're going with  Baby Raper  I got to go  Baby Raper  Okay  Later guys  That gives a little  Explanation  You know  I think at this point  I think we've had enough  Baby Raper type songs  Well they do strike a nerve  We need you guys  To spread out the topics here  What else can be offensive  What else  I'm thinking  We have the racism thing  Pretty well covered 
[03:08:00]  We have the baby raping thing  Pretty well covered  What else  Camp concentration  Camp concentration  Right  But that falls into  You know  Racism  I don't know  People are either upset  About race  Or baby raping  That's it  Alright  Carolyn  Yeah  How are you  I'm good  I wanted to say  A couple things  First that I didn't think  That the Chevalier song  Was so offensive  And I also didn't think  That it was that creative  Because  Because he already 
[03:08:30]  The original intention  Of the song  Was about little girls  So he really didn't  Take it  In a totally  Oh yeah  It's just like  The original  Thank heaven for little girls  That's sort of  You know  Which is supposed to be  Just some sweet  Little tribute  Or some ode  To girls  And how sweet they are  And how wonderful  A place they make  The world  Yeah  Yeah  It's just like it  Jesus man  And also  And I mean  Taiwan  Anyway 
[03:09:00]  The other thing  That I wanted to say  Was that  I mean officially  I guess I'm  Still considered  A little girl  Because I'm 17  Okay  But I find that  Anthony has like  A really really sexy voice  And  That's your baby man  I like those sexy voice  Okay well not that voice  But one of his other voices  Is sexy in there somewhere  But  I don't know  The whole  Pedophile thing  I'm sorry  I'm boring you  Yeah you kind of are  I'm sorry  And I'm nervous  And I sort of forgot  No you did  You did fine 
[03:09:30]  No I didn't  Yes you did  Let's rate her appearance  Oh I did  I did have a reason  I did have another  Area of  Of offensiveness  That I think that people  Could go into  They could maybe  Have  They could maybe  Have  They could maybe  Have sex with  Quadriplegics  Or people who  Are wheelchair bound  Against their will  It's taken a while  And off the edge  Of the table  I know  Whoever sees that  One coming  Carolyn thank you 
[03:10:00]  Well he's going to  Hit by a train  No  Oh no  Oh no  Not worth the train  Alright thank you  Oh nice  I slam  Yeah  Alright we hung up  On her  Green  Green what's going on  Hello  Hi  I've got to go with  Camp Concentration  Because the other one's like  The other one  KKK man  Yeah  He's like the N word  And everything  And has to use like  Shocking things  To make you offended  The Camp Concentration  Is about to keep you

[03:12:30]  Yeah what's the story  They're starting to say  Well  At first they were saying  That he might have  Killed his son  And then when the cops came  That's when he ran up  On the roof  So they wouldn't take him in  Or something like that  Alright let's see  A gunman killed himself  Eight hours standoff  With police  Implicated himself  In his stepson's murder  Let's see  His 19 year old stepson  Missing since September  This guy called the local  Cable TV station  What was it News 12  Yes  Called News 12  News 12 getting the coup  The crack team 
[03:13:00]  Man if I'm going to take  My own life  I'm calling CNN  Call a real news station  News 12  News 12  And now the weather  From your backyard  Anthony  News 12  Did they send that hot chick  The blonde  That was her name  They sent some guy down there  See a lot of people  Aren't from Long Island  News 12 is the local  Little news station  They're award winning  Award winning  Come on  They basically have  One newscast  That they run  Over and over  And over again  All day long  You know what was funny 
[03:13:30]  I was watching News 12  When the Gulf War started  Like I was going  All over the place  CNN of course  Shows Baghdad  Just tracer rounds  Flying up in the air  I switched to News 12  Their pre-recorded news  They did that morning  Was still showing a guy  Making a cake  I'm like  There is a war going on  And this guy on News 12  Will show you  How to make a cake  News 12  Long Island  From your backyard  Right  Got the voice down too  Right  From Queens to Riverhead 
[03:14:00]  Who gives a crap  So he calls News 12  Send him down there  Let's see  This TV station  Tells the news  That his son's body parts  Had been found  And he was thinking  About killing himself  Cops from New York City  Never told him  About the dismemberment  Oh they found  The guy  The stepson's body  Like pieces of his head  Oh  There's a Tupperware box  With scrawled 
[03:14:30]  On his skull  In magic marker  Anti-gay  And anti-black epithets  He was biracial  His father was white  His mother black  Hmm  And then he shot himself  So this guy gets implicated  In his stepson's  His biracial stepson's murder  Because they find  The stepson's skull  With anti-gay  And anti-black epithets  The guy did it  So he shot himself  And you videotaped it  Yeah  That's great  Because he lives  Across the street  And I even brought it in 
[03:15:00]  For you guys to see  Oh it isn't like  The arbutus wire  Is it  Where you see the blood  Just coming out of his face  No I didn't get  That kind of shot  He slid down  In the back of the house  Oh you didn't do  A two camera shoot  Desi  I'm sorry  Have another camera  In the backyard  Hey cut the camera too  Brad  He's sliding off the roof  Battery crapped out  Battery crapped  Come on kill yourself  My battery's low  I gotta go to the O&A show  Was anyone else filming it  At the time I didn't know  But it turns out  The next day 
[03:15:30]  Some guy shows up  With his video camera  But he stopped filming  About an hour  Before the guy did it  So  Oh lost out  And the big news  All the news agencies  Want a copy of  Bill's tape  Wasn't News 12 there  Didn't they tape it  They weren't smart enough  To turn on their camera  No they kept everyone  A half mile down the road  They totally  Blocked off  A mile radius  So what  You were there  What out your window  Yeah they wouldn't  Let us out of the house  Because the guy  Oh so your video  Were you scared  He was going to shoot at you  No because 
[03:16:00]  I saw him shooting the shots  Into the air in the morning  And that's all he seemed  To be doing  I mean he wasn't  Pointing at anybody  No he couldn't just  Lean the barrel down at me  And take a shot  I'd have had that figured out  Do you have any guns  Of your own  No  Could have traded fire  That could have been fun  You know  Imagine that  The guy's thinking  He's going to be all hot  Taking some shots  Maybe take his own life  And he gets popped by the neighbor  Damn  Who saw that coming  Talk about friendly fire  Yeah  So what you see on the tape  Anthony  Because this is radio  The guy goes on the other side 
[03:16:30]  Of the roof  So now you can't even see him  In view anymore  Oh it's sort of like a PG movie  No but he used a big gun  He used a bidding  Yeah  Was it a rifle  Or a  It looked like it was probably a .44  Oh  Oh personally yeah  He used a big gun  And then you hear the blast  And it was all over  At that point  All right  Right there in Dix Hills  Would you like to see the video  Anthony  Hmm  What's more amazing  Okay  That somebody did this  Or that there was even  Somebody half black  Living in Dix Hills  I think the latter of the two 
[03:17:00]  I smell a song coming  Could be  Oh what  Do I have to watch  I hate watching people  People send me this gross stuff  On the email  I don't even look at it  Just go  Sex rules  Like violence I don't like  You're the only one  That hasn't seen it  Go in the other room  Mark turn on a mic for Anthony  And just look at it real fast  It'll take 30 seconds  30 seconds  It's really not that bad  Anthony going into the other studio 
[03:17:30]  Psycho Mark in there  With Bill's videotape  Of the guy blowing his head off  On top of the roof  What the hell was that  Hey  Hey  Oh Jesus  All right Anthony  You're in the other studio  I see that  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  I'm eagerly awaiting  The  All right  Psycho Mark  Start the tape for Anthony  Okay  Anthony explain what you see  I can't hear you  All right  The guy  I'm seeing some woods  Some wooded area  Is that the guy?  Oh on the roof 
[03:18:00]  Right  It's through the trees  Watch this  All right  E  Here it comes  What did you use  A tape that you  Used to tape  ESPN  No that's the recorder  You didn't see him  Okay  You didn't see him  All right  But you hear the blast  Wow  Yeah  Pulitzer Prize winning footage  There pal  Thank you  Thank you  Almost as good  As the  Sapruder film  Can I be the reporter  On Spaz Radio then? 
[03:18:30]  All right  And coming back  Into the studio here  See it's not that  It's not that bad  But talk about  The missed shot  Huh?  Yeah I know  I know  It's kind of like  The Sapruder film  No you saw  Kennedy's brains  Hit the  Hit the thing  Hit his wife  But the interesting part  He has like  18 minutes of footage  What else is on there?  From the standoff  He made us like  A best of tape  Oh good  A highlight reel  At one point  He took his clothes off  To show one of the cops  His tats  Because he was a veteran too  That was interesting  Okay  You got that  Yeah I got that 
[03:19:00]  I got him  Pulling something out of the  It looked like he stashed  Some booze up in the chimney  I had him pulling that out  Chugged that down  Threw it off the roof  And just a lot of him  Screaming about how  He's just trying to get  The cops to shoot him  Wow really  He was almost begging for it  Why didn't he point  The gun at the cops?  I don't know  That would have gone at  The cops to shoot him  Joe what's going on?  How you guys doing Owen?  Good  Hey  Listen what happened was  This guy got a call  From the cops in Queens  Saying they found the body  And like you started to say  He called News 12  And he said that  They found his body parts 
[03:19:30]  But they never told him that  So he gave himself up  When he said that  To News 12  Ah  He kind of implicated himself  Yeah they ambushed him there  That's pretty funny  The best part about that  Is the next day  The cops come to my house  And tell me that  Everything that he said  On the roof was a lie  And I'm like  I recorded it buddy  I saw it all  Heard it all  Hey X-Nag  We're lucky after you now  You got the tape  Wow  Alright Joe  Thank you  Joe  I think we lost Joe  Didn't really  Didn't really get a good view of him 
[03:20:00]  Killing himself  He kind of ducked down  Yeah behind the peak of the roof  Yeah  So  Who are you going to sell the tape to  You think?  I don't know  See what happens  See who calls  Got a couple calls in  I'm ready for people  Who called you  Well first  Real quality show  Queen Latifah called me  Queen Latifah  Huh  I was right on top of that one  Queen Latifah  Yeah I got 2020 called after that  Yeah  Give it a 2020  Yeah we'll see  What Barbara Walters  Want to say  I don't think it's that good quality though  Like the content isn't that good 
[03:20:30]  He totally disappears  I know  Behind the roof  I think it's a lot  Yeah but they wouldn't  They wouldn't show that on TV anyway  Every news station showed it at 6 o'clock  Showed what I had  Really?
