<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off course.  The show began with Opie, Jimmy Norton, and guest Robert Kelly (“Floppy”) discussing Thanksgiving traditions and the awkwardness of navigating family gatherings, particularly Norton's experiences with his in-laws.  The conversation then shifted to the uncomfortable aspects of Catholic Mass, specifically the communion ritual,  followed by a comparison to a less impressive Protestant service.  Anthony’s hair transplant was also brought up, prompting jokes about his previous balding.  The segment included mutual insults between the hosts and Kelly, a abruptly ended listener call,  and mentions of the loss of their radio show in Boston and Cleveland, along with a brief discussion of Plaxico Burress's accidental shooting.


The next segment focused on a New York City gun law discussion, criticizing Michael Bloomberg's urban planning, followed by complaints about Call of Duty 5's controls and frustrating online players.  Calls from Kyle (Westchester) and JC (Jersey) detailed their own negative experiences with the game. This transitioned into a lengthy reminiscence about Bobby Kelly's childhood, including his lack of high school graduation, substance use, and time in continuation school.  The hosts also discussed their unfamiliarity with "dittos" and mimeograph machines.  Kelly recounted his first experience smoking marijuana, and the conversation broadened to include childhood toys, focusing on those with potential safety hazards like Stretch Armstrong and Click Clacks.


The discussion of dangerous toys continued into the next segment, with a caller, Ed, sharing his experience with a molten metal car maker toy.  The hosts then promoted their upcoming stand-up comedy shows.  A discussion about a recent wedding led to a derisive critique of Deepak Chopra, contrasted with praise for Sean Hannity's response to Chopra's comments blaming U.S. policy for terrorist acts in India. This sparked a lengthy, heated discussion about radical Islam, the West's relationship with the Middle East, and perceived media hypocrisy.  The hosts criticized what they saw as appeasement.  The segment concluded with a contentious debate about the iPhone's flaws and shortcomings, with Laszlo present in studio for a portion.  The conversation included speculation on future technologies, like “monitor paint,” flexible screens, and the eventual disappearance of physical currency and newspapers.


The following segment began with a discussion about the obsolescence of technologies like email, CDs, and cassettes, transitioning into speculation about the demise of movie theaters due to terrorism, disease, and the rise of home entertainment systems. One host detailed his extensive home theater setup, expressing his disdain for DVDs. The discussion moved to the future of newspapers, touching upon affordability and accessibility of new technologies. The segment included tangents like a detailed account of one host's experience shooting a Desert Eagle pistol, resulting in a minor injury, and a graphic discussion about rape fantasies, sexual preferences, and recollections of 1980s sitcoms, including graphic descriptions of imagined scenes involving characters from *C.H.I.P.S.* and *Different Strokes*, and speculation about the fate of Skippy from *Family Ties*.  Highly offensive language was used throughout this segment.


The final segment started with a discussion about a movie title (possibly "Run Away") involving Gene Simmons and Tom Selleck, and speculation about the death of a *Family Ties* character. This shifted to a vulgar account of one host urinating near Tom Jones.  The hosts then played audio clips from *Different Strokes*, depicting a scene with suggestive behavior between adult males and a child, leading to discussion of the sitcom's handling of the situation and related topics like child stars, nude photos of actresses, and personal experiences with celebrities and pornography. The show concluded with a “What Did We Learn?” segment, listener calls, banter about travel plans, and promotion of the Laszlo show and upcoming Opie and Anthony appearances. Robert Kelly was a guest throughout the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, there I am.  Hi, uh...  Opie and Anthony show.  How you doing?  Jimmy Norton, of course.  And, uh, joining us today... 
[00:00:30]  This is Robert Kelly.  Floppy.  Happy Thanksgiving, guys.  I didn't see you.  Well, I saw Jimmy.  You guys always see each other.  He didn't come over to my house this year, though.  I have him over to my house for Thanksgiving every year.  That's been like a tradition.  He went over to Patrice's this year.  Oh, boy.  That's what happens when you get a black president.  It's all over.  Yeah, you gotta start, you know, kissing up to, uh, to the other side.  Went over there and came over to my house just for dessert this year.  You're taking it for granted.  All of a sudden, I'm gonna be there.  I had to show you that sometimes I'm, uh... 
[00:01:00]  I'm not.  Other people ask me to dance.  He's not just committed to you.  Yeah, all of a sudden, Bob just thinks,  Hey, we're having turkey.  What time are you gonna be there?  Maybe I'm not, Bob.  Aw.  He did come over for pie, though.  Of course I did.  He did, though.  Oh, you came over for a little, uh...  Yeah.  That's kind of like throwing you a bone.  You know?  The, uh, dessert thing.  Yeah.  Because I know that traditional...  Thanksgiving and Christmas, very traditional at my family.  They don't like changing things at all. 
[00:01:30]  Right.  And, uh, Thanksgiving's always been over at my grandmother's house, which is now like my aunt and uncle's house.  You know what changes that?  Don't change it, though?  Death.  Death.  As soon as people start dying, and your grandmother and grandfather are too old to, like, move, it's not the same.  Yeah.  We'll just stop showing up.  Yeah.  Well, my grandmother, she's, uh, you know, she's in, uh, home now.  Yeah.  But, uh, because it used to be her house, and she used to do the cooking and everything like that.  Now it's Aunt Fran and Uncle Tony.  So nothing's really changed.  We all go over there still and have Thanksgiving. 
[00:02:00]  But, uh, ever since I've been out of, um, you know, relationships and stuff, uh, it's been different because I've been able to go over there whenever I want.  But, uh, I was starting to get that whole, well, why don't we go over my family?  You know, why don't we go over my family's house for this or that?  And then you got to tell your family you're not going to be showing up.  Uh, they get like, oh, you're here every year.  They don't like breaking tradition.  Yeah.  You know, and you can't just pop in for dessert.  It's not the same. 
[00:02:30]  That happened to me when I got married.  Like, every year I go to my mom's for Christmas Eve.  Yeah.  I spend the night.  And then I go, I hang at my mom's in the morning.  And then we go to my grandmother's.  My whole life.  That's what everybody does in my family.  And then you get married.  All of a sudden I got to slip her family in on Christmas Day for like, because they have  lamb and she has to go there.  And it's like, you know what?  It's like some new tradition you know nothing of, want no part of really.  Yeah, you have to sit in that uncomfortable chair all day, like in the living room.  And just want to tell you, you can't take a nap because it's just a bunch of kids you 
[00:03:00]  don't know running around.  Yeah, you don't know.  And then you can't tell Uncle Paul.  And you don't know anyone enough to really get into any good conversation.  So it's usually some boring.  You usually wind up talking to the other new boyfriend or girlfriend.  Yeah.  They let you in on some things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you realize that, you know, like, oh my God, this person's a creep and nobody  knows except me.  That's what happened with the my ex-girlfriend.  Which one? 
[00:03:30]  The original, not the wife one, Melinda.  Right, right, right.  And her family.  You know, I went over there and stuff.  And then I was talking with Buddy, who is the brother-in-law.  You know, he's not a member of the family.  And then he just let me on to the whole thing.  He's like, all right, here's the story.  I was like, thank you, man.  Thanks.  He gave me all the info I needed to know about, you know, that family.  Uh, so that was good.  But, uh, for the most part, you do.  You sit with people you don't really know. 
[00:04:00]  You can't talk to.  It's uncomfortable.  I just want to go over my family.  I wanted to say, you know, your family isn't important to me.  So I'm just going to go over my family's house.  You can go over yours.  Well, there is.  Someone always has the better family.  Yeah, it's true.  The more fun family.  Mine is the fun family.  Yeah, mine's the fun family.  I mean, her family's fun.  I'm not taking anything away from her family.  They're fun.  But I got five uncles.  I got two aunts.  They all have kids.  It's a huge event.  My grandfather's hilarious.  He's 98.  He's still putting around, busting balls. 
[00:04:30]  You know what I mean?  That's what you need.  My family on Thanksgiving, it was like every bomb was being thrown around the table.  The F's, the N's, every bomb you could put.  Every alphabet bomb was being thrown around.  And, you know, it's funny because it's supposed to be some family event.  You're supposed to be, I guess, you know, it's one of those things.  You're supposed to be nice and giving thanks. 
[00:05:00]  Say grace.  You say grace?  No.  That's just it.  If I went over to a family and they started saying grace, I'd be sitting there so uncomfortable.  I don't know any of the words.  That's what happened.  When we were talking yesterday about Opie's wedding and I get in church and I've been  a Catholic technically for years, but I don't know any of the, I don't know the show.  I don't know the script.  Right.  When they start, you know, Lord, hear our prayer and everybody's around saying it. 
[00:05:30]  And I'm like, there ain't prayer.  Like, I don't know when to come in and say that stuff.  And then they, they, everybody else knows.  And then you got the too loud guy next to you.  Lord, hear our prayer.  Like, Oh God, he's much too loud.  And it's embarrassing.  It is.  It's uncomfortable.  Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.  And then there's that part in it where the church just, it makes me cringe every time.  And forgive us our trespasses. 
[00:06:00]  We forgive those trespasses.  It's just this S-E hissy thing going on in the whole church.  And I pointed out to whoever I'm with, I go, I'm like, listen to this.  Here comes the S-E hissy part.  And they go, what?  I go, listen.  It's the trespasses, the little trespasses.  And they laugh.  And, you know, I'm closer to hell.  I used to be an alder boy and I actually got kicked out because I couldn't, I could never  get down the whole route. 
[00:06:30]  Too much teeth, my son.  Oh, my son.  I'm sorry, dude.  He's so cute, too.  That whole ding-a-ling-a-ling.  Yeah, there's a bunch of things you got to do.  And then it's like, all right, please kneel.  And you're like, oh, it's the kneeling part.  I don't like the kneeling part.  They pull that little thing out that you got to kneel on.  Yeah.  Oh, I don't like that new thing either.  That's a new age kind of thing.  It's not even new anymore, but it's relatively new. 
[00:07:00]  What's that?  That, you know, shake hands.  Peace be with you.  Peace be with you.  And you got to shake hands or maybe give a little kiss on the cheek to the woman.  Kiss on the cheek.  That's next.  You're like, peace be with you.  And he's shaking hands.  And I don't want to do the peace be with you.  I want to stand there and feel like I don't belong in there.  And then get the F out.  Just do what I do.  Just grab one guy's hand and hold on to it and just keep shaking his hand and swat other  people away. 
[00:07:30]  Get away.  I want peace to be with him.  I don't care about you.  War to you.  Yeah.  Go to.  Will you grab the guy's knuckles and drag it towards your crotch?  Jesus.  My peace be with you.  And then the songs, like people just know the songs off the top of their head.  And you got too loud guys singing the songs too loud.  I don't even, I don't, I don't know any of that stuff.  Hallelujah. 
[00:08:00]  Hallelujah.  Hallelujah.  Is it hallelujah or hallelujah?  And they have to say it like that.  Hallelujah.  No.  Christ in Israel.  They don't know the words.  And then they got the books that are never used.  I don't know what those books are.  They always get lost in the pages.  I was drawing little stick figure animations in mine so you could flip through it and see  like a stick figure guy having sex. 
[00:08:30]  I had time on my hands.  What am I going to do?  But it is an odd situation to be thrown into church.  Wait, if you're not a church going person, you can tell the church going people.  Yeah.  They know the ups and downs.  They know when to do it.  You know, you do the sign of the cross.  And I feel stupid doing that because I feel like, oh, you know, that's the easy part that  everyone knows.  You see everybody start doing the sign of the cross.  They do it.  But there's one thing that they do where you do the little X on your head with the thumb 
[00:09:00]  and then you touch your chin and then and then your nose and your kiss, your knuckle.  Yeah.  What is that?  That's what I forget.  That's some saint.  Some some.  That's a different thing.  But that always messes.  I don't know if I do it on my mouth, my lips, my chin.  I couldn't tell you what it is or what it is.  I put a thumb in each ear and go, oh, I have no idea.  It's like when they were talking about Vincent the Chin.  Nobody would say the chin because of FBI wiretaps. 
[00:09:30]  They would tap their chin.  When they would talk about the monster.  Oh, word comes down and they would just tap their chin.  The chin.  So that the wiretaps wouldn't pick it up.  It's something like that.  I'm telling you.  Good thing it wasn't, you know, Vinny the Balls.  It'd be a little odd to go.  Good thing you weren't Vinny the Chin.  They wouldn't be able to do it.  Oh, oh.  You have no chin.  I got it.  I see it coming every time, but I still like it. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, so that was.  The beginning of the Catholic Church is a quick in and out.  I mean, it's a quick in and out.  That was a long mess.  It has certain things.  Like, you know, when this happens, we're halfway through.  And then when you go get the bread and you can't go, I can't go.  Why can't I go?  Like, I would think I could go.  No, you can't.  Like, I am Catholic.  No, you have to go.  So why can't I receive communion?  You can't.  You have to confess your sins in the last month or something like that. 
[00:10:30]  Month?  Yeah, you can't go in and just take Jesus into your mouth.  I've seen people go up there that probably haven't been to church in a while.  I don't know.  I just always assumed if you're Catholic, you could go up there and, you know, embody your  Christ.  Amen.  You're out.  Do you ever try to save it?  Get the body of Christ and then save it like on the roof of your mouth without it getting  wet and dissolving and then pull it out?  No way.  You're not supposed to do that.  Although people chew them now.  Like, my mother was telling me, she goes, when I was going to Catholic school, you couldn't 
[00:11:00]  chew that.  It had to sit in your mouth and dissolve.  Like, if your teeth touched it, you were going to burn in hell.  Yeah.  I went to Catholic school.  They taught us the same thing.  Yeah, same thing.  And another thing that gets me is this solemn walk back to the pew that people do after  they receive communion.  I was noticing that, too.  They get the communion, the little communion wafers.  She loves to taste the communion wafers, Father.  She loves to taste the communion wafers.  Saturday night.  Oh, okay.  So, and then the walk back to the pew, the clutched hands, the interlocked fingers down 
[00:11:30]  by your waist, the head down, and the slow, solemn walk back to the pew.  Why?  It's thoughtful.  It's not thoughtful.  It's full of penance.  They're not thinking of, you know, I have just accepted the body of Christ, and now I  am solemnly walking back because I am so not worthy.  They just do it because that's what you're told to do. 
[00:12:00]  There isn't any real feeling that goes into that whole thing.  You can tell.  Then they sit back down, and they're checking their text messages.  What do you think?  Jesus texted you, thank you for indulging in my body.  Hey, that was my liver out.  Yeah.  LOL, Jesus.  J to the C.  2009.  I went to Christian churches.  Because a Catholic church is pretty much, they know, look, come in, get out, here's  your stuff.  Yeah.  Christian church makes you do, like they have greeters, and they're like, hey, and they 
[00:12:30]  try to get, yeah, hey, how are you?  They're trying to pull everyone in.  And they actually give away, I went to one in New York with a friend of mine once, and  You weren't Catholic?  Well, you can go.  I'm Catholic, but you can go to any church you want.  Could you help an old altar boy, father?  And they, uh, you actually-  Midnight Cowboy?  Exorcist.  Exorcist.  Damn it.  What the hell do I know?  They gave away, it was kind of a cheap church, like I didn't have too much money, so they 
[00:13:00]  gave away for the body of Christ, I swear to God, it was Wonder Bread.  Oh, that's bad.  It was chunks of Wonder Bread.  And little cups of wine.  Everybody got wine, but I'm, you know, I don't drink, you know, I've been-  Yeah, of course.  For years.  So I was like, dude, you have to drink the wine first.  And they're like, all right, drink the wine.  And then he drank it.  I go, what is it?  He goes, grape juice.  I go, okay.  And I checked.  Oh, grape juice?  Yeah.  Is that legal?  Years of sobriety.  You go, that crappy church.  It's because the guy, like, blesses some Wonder Bread. 
[00:13:30]  It all of a sudden becomes the body of Christ.  I don't know.  It was Wonder Bread.  It was just uncomfortable.  It's like, this is-  You couldn't get a-  They must have a discount on wafers.  Sticking to the roof of your mouth.  They cut the corners off the Messiah.  Pepperidge Farm.  Is the Messiah coming wheat, trying to watch my carbon cake?  Yeah, they could just change rules like that.  It doesn't seem as legit, you know?  Wonder Bread and grape juice. 
[00:14:00]  Where the hell was this church?  It was up on the Upper East Side.  Yeah, it was one of those churches that looks like an insurance building during the day.  Oh, didn't have, like, the nice gothic look to it.  No, it looked like an insane asylum.  Had pumpkins on the window and stuff like that.  I like when they make churches out of buildings that architecturally were built for a certain thing, like a Carvel.  And you just know there's that slanted roof, and there were two giant ice cream cones on each corner. 
[00:14:30]  And it's like, it's a church now.  It's like, stop it.  It was a Carvel.  There was an old sizzler.  And there was a church.  The church of Pizza Hut.  You just know.  You can get a six-inch or a foot-long body of Christ.  Some of those buildings.  I remember there was a real estate building.  And it was obviously an old Carvel here in New York.  And they were very identifiable buildings because they were all custom-made just for Carvel.  Big glass fronts. 
[00:15:00]  And then it was a real estate.  And it's like, who would buy that real estate from that place when you know it was...  They bought an ice cream place for their building.  Right.  Well, they have a comedy club and a church now.  What is that, Norton?  In Connecticut.  I've done two of them.  One is in Detroit, which was one of the...  It's weird because they smoke in it.  They got to decommission those places or something?  I don't know.  What's the ruling on that?  Allow Satan in?  I know like they got...  Yeah.  I know they got like the Limelight in the city.  It was a club just known for its drugs and debauchery going on. 
[00:15:30]  And it was an old church.  You would think somebody would have to come in and go, okay.  This is no longer a holy place.  There's going to be girls going down on men for cocaine in this bathroom.  Exactly.  Just stained couches glowing in the blacklight.  It's like a cougar.  And then the club moved in?  Yeah.  I get you.  I see you.  Sure.  The altar boys.  Bing, bang.  Boom.  Bing, bang.  Henry, what the hell?  Hit a DMR. 
[00:16:00]  It'll pull up.  When does it happen?  When the last cross gets carried out?  Yeah.  As the door's closing, the edge of the cross is hitting it, the club music starts.  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Yeah.  Is there like a waiting period?  Can't wait to make sure the Lord's out.  Yeah, and do you feel a little weird carrying that cross out?  Like, you know, hey.  What cross?  You know, the big cross over the altar.  They don't just leave things in there, you know.  They've got to go somewhere.  Do you carry it out kind of and then make that little kind of gesture that you're having 
[00:16:30]  a tough time carrying it?  They put little earmuffs on them and a blindfold.  Little thorns on your head.  It just seems like you might do that as a goof.  The crown of Yankee slash thorns.  The one in Connecticut, the comedy club is weird because it still has the pews in it.  So you really are standing in a church.  I mean, it's like the cross is gone and like the real like Catholic stuff is off the walls,  but it's the pews.  I mean, it's like it's bizarre.  Yeah.  It's the what?  The pews are still there.  The pews.  Oh, did I say that? 
[00:17:00]  The pews.  That's the way I say it.  That's when Voss is playing there.  That's what the people are saying.  Pew.  Oh, jeez.  I'm very funny.  We know it.  I'm funny in a church.  The pews.  Very funny.  Can you pick those up for me?  Those are my teeth.  Hey, do they still have the little kneeling benches?  They took the little flop down kneeling benches for your knees?  I don't know.  I didn't clean up after I was on stage.  Oh, you don't have to do that?  I imagine they do.  I mean, I went and sat in one of the pews for a little bit. 
[00:17:30]  No, what is kneeling optional?  That was a whole thing, too.  It's like, hey, you can kneel or sit.  Or keep your ass against the chair.  You can keep your ass against the chair and just rest your knees,  which is what I did at Hope's Wedding, actually,  because I realized that my knees are not what they used to be.  You just kind of sit on the chair.  It's a half sitting.  Stop using them so much.  That comes from one of Jimmy's favorite pastimes,  which isn't what you think it would be, right?  Right.  Yeah.  When a girl is also on her knees and maybe on her elbows,  and Jimmy's on his knees, you know. 
[00:18:00]  I know what you're talking about.  Yeah, yeah.  You do the old rover move.  Get away from it.  What are you doing?  Get away.  Everyone ring around the Rosie with each other. 
[00:18:30]  Wonderful.  There's a bit of black churches.  That's like an hour.  Well, it was.  That's an hour.  At least it's a Catholic church.  It's a half hour.  You're done.  That's kind of what Opie's wedding was, though.  It was, they had gospel singers.  Really?  Up on the balcony.  Wow.  And they were singing like gospel tunes,  which was kind of weird.  I never took Opie for having a wedding like that  with gospel singers. 
[00:19:00]  Not that I think he's racist or anything.  Right.  It's just one of those things on your wedding day.  Yeah.  Especially since, you know,  the guests were predominantly white.  Right.  Aside from Patrice and his chick,  I think it was all white.  Was that it?  Really?  Patrice and his chick?  Yeah.  There had been one or one other.  I heard Patrice look fantastic.  Well, you know, he was pimped out.  Yeah.  Totally.  That velvet fedora.  God bless him.  And the big suit, mustard colored tie.  His chick must have looked smoky. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, she was slamming.  Just slamming.  Of course.  Of course.  Beautiful dress.  Her hair must have been beautiful.  Yeah.  Everybody's looking at her.  Nice.  And, you know, but he's Patrice.  He sits down at the table.  There's people.  Yeah, there's a picture of him right there.  There's people sitting at the table that don't know him from a hole in the wall,  and he's not holding back.  He's, you know, professing his theories on relationships and whatnot.  People at the table are horrified.  Look at the guy behind him.  Just looks pissed off already.  Yeah, of course he is. 
[00:20:00]  Rush Limbaugh behind him.  Look what he's got sitting behind him.  Yeah, we've got to take a little break.  But don't fret.  Don't fret.  Don't go anywhere.  We might even take a call today.  What?  We get very selfish here when it's just me and Jimmy and, of course, Bobby Kelly today.  We get selfish.  We like talking amongst ourselves.  And we say, screw the listeners.  What do they have to add?  But perhaps we'll take a phone call. 
[00:20:30]  If you want to call the program, 877-212-ONA.  It's very easy.  And we'll be right back with this fine program in one moment.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Boy, during the break, I'm just reading some little messages from the fine people on PalTalk. 
[00:21:00]  And, wow, they're just abusing the crap out of me today.  Anyway, I don't get much from the staff, which leads me to believe that they're not being as honest with me.  You're right.  You're exactly right.  That they're not being as honest with me as I thought.  And forthright.  Because I'm wearing a bandana on my head.  I never wear a bandana on my head.  I look like Chloe from Fight Club.  And before I die, I'd like to have sex. 
[00:21:30]  I have pornographic tapes.  And amel nitrates.  Amel nitrates.  Mike feeds back.  Dying corpse.  But, yeah, they give me a lot of crap for wearing a bandana.  Because yesterday I came in and wore my standard hat.  And I took the pain because it was hurting me.  The hat was hurting.  But I didn't want to take the abuse.  I was obviously telling you guys what I did over Thanksgiving vacation. 
[00:22:00]  I went to the medical hair restoration.  And I got hair put on the top of my head where it was falling out.  And I had a big, giant, bald spot.  And jumped the shark.  Who is that?  T-winner A?  Twinner A?  What is jumping the shark?  First of all, if you say jumped the shark, you've jumped the shark. 
[00:22:30]  That term, jumped the shark.  Come up with something new.  Yeah.  But how did I jump the shark?  Because I didn't want to look at pictures of me anymore with a big glowing spot on my head.  I looked like, speaking of the Catholic Church, I looked like those pictures of Jesus with a big glowing thing on my head.  I had a halo.  So, I just didn't like it anymore.  Good for you, man.  You know, I didn't like it.  I didn't want to wear the Gene Simmons hat wig.  I didn't want to go with a comb over. 
[00:23:00]  Or I didn't want to go with the shaved head.  Because I'm not the type of guy that can shave his head.  I don't, I shaved off my mustache and goatee once.  And all I heard all day were AIDS jokes.  It's like, I remove any facial hair and all of a sudden I have AIDS.  It kind of makes you wonder that like, if you know, like there's, I have regular friends, like civilians out there.  Yeah, yeah.  Who do things and nobody says anything to you.  It's all behind your back.  Exactly.  It's all to their wives or their other friends. 
[00:23:30]  Hey, you look great, man.  Do you see Bobby's new face?  So am I, he shaved his life.  Yeah, what's he doing?  It kind of makes you wonder though, having like, you know, friends like we do.  Maybe, maybe I kind of want not, I don't know, maybe I just want to.  Ignorance is bliss.  Yeah, talk behind my back.  You want to be put back into the matrix.  Yeah, maybe, yeah, exactly.  I feel like going to the cellar and Louie's there and Norton's there.  It's just like, ugh.  You can't ever have a bad day emotionally and be around the people we know.  No.  Because you'll kill yourself. 
[00:24:00]  Bobby came in the other night and Louie walked over and just started attacking Bob.  And then when Bobby walked away, Louie's like, he looks, he lost a lot of weight.  Yeah.  He looks good.  But I don't want to tell him that.  I don't want him to feel good.  Yeah, yeah.  See, it even works reverse like that.  Instead of just bashing someone, you don't want to tell him something nice.  But do you understand that?  Do you understand how hard it is to explain that to like a therapist or anybody in your  family about your friends?  No, because they don't understand what creeps we hang around with.  Yeah, it's unbelievable what scumbags. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  And it's, I mean, they're honest.  They're just honest.  They're literally saying what everybody else is thinking.  Yeah.  In the world.  They're just being polite.  But sometimes I-  The civilians, as you call them.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like, you know, hey man, you look great.  And you know, he's a piece of crap.  He stinks.  Look at him.  He's a fat mess.  Oh, they'll say, oh my God, you look great.  If you lost weight, I'd get, oh, you look great.  But these guys, I, you know, nothing.  I left the other night like, what am I, what am I doing?  Like, what did I, should I go back to Bunker Hill Community College and get my associate's 
[00:25:00]  degree in fine arts and become an art teacher in a crappy junior high somewhere just so I  can get love in my life?  Just be a normal human being.  First of all, forget college.  You know, what are you going to do?  Waste the next 10 years of your life?  Get it?  Yeah, we got it.  I think that we can't even compliment each other.  That's the problem.  It's like, hey Bob, you lost weight.  Oh yeah, thanks a lot.  Thin lips.  It's like you say something nice to somebody and they say something horrible back to you 
[00:25:30]  so you just decide not to say anything nice.  Just guilt.  I'm guilty of it too.  But you're the, you're one of the, like the founding fathers.  You're, you're like, you're like Washington or Adams of the scumbag friends.  No, don't shake your head.  You're one of those, you're the original guy.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, you call in, you're one of the original guys that made it okay to go, look at you.  You suck.  Yeah, but it is.  You used to slap CDs out of hand.  You bought Rich Voss' first CD. 
[00:26:00]  And last.  One sold.  You bought a CD and he was, you know how happy that made him that you bought it?  And then you took it and stepped on it.  You will do that.  Yeah, I did.  I bought the comedy cellar in front of 30 people.  It was fantastic.  Like, but we all know Bobby's lost a lot of weight and everything and looks good.  But the only thing, I'm guilty of it too. 
[00:26:30]  The only thing I can bring up is, remember when Bobby was fat and we used to say, and  then you go along and continue with fat jokes.  Yeah, you're the only people, you're the only friends that actually are pissed off that  I lost weight.  Yes, we talk about that all the time.  It's like, oh yeah, Bobby ruined a good bit.  Like your health was a bit.  Exactly.  Your lack thereof.  Ugh.  And now I'm just looking at, like I said, I was looking at the talk.  I'm sorry.  They're just hammering me for wearing a bandana. 
[00:27:00]  Like, oh, Anthony is in a biker gang.  He's a crip.  Looking at him makes me want to smoke a joint.  Um, he's got HIV.  Uh, when are you getting your cancer wig?  Carlos Santantini.  Little Steven.  Creep.  Just a creep.  That's probably the best one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's, uh, that's it.  No, I, I, I did have some, some, uh, hair taken from, uh, the back of my head and put 
[00:27:30]  on top where it was a, just a, a void.  There's nothing there.  God bless you.  I didn't like that.  You take pictures of everything.  Who is that?  Lyle Alzado.  Lyle Alzado.  At the end of his life.  At the end of his life when he had the pudding head brain cancer and he's wearing the exact  bandana I have on.  Great.  Fantastic.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Thanks for that.  It was, uh, it was one of those things though where it's like a lot of pictures get taken 
[00:28:00]  at appearances by listeners or what and they get posted on message boards and stuff and,  uh, some people comment on them but for the most part you just look at it and go like,  uh.  Can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  When you started losing your hair, cause like when I, when I started losing mine, I have  curly hair too.  Yeah.  Like it's, would, did you ever like try to fix it before you went out?  So, but then if a big wind came up or like it started raining, you started panicking that, 
[00:28:30]  that bald spot that you, you made go away with hairspray and your fingers and a hairdryer  is just going to like fade away.  And I never went as far as the hairspray or, or anything like that, but yeah, you'd shuffle  it around.  You'd shuffle your curls around that you had left to try to put them over the parts that  you didn't have.  It wasn't a comb over per se, but you were camouflaging.  Yes.  Uh, to make up for, you know, the, the glaring hole in, uh, in your hair. 
[00:29:00]  I used to bake hair like a cake before I went out.  Why?  Cause that, you know, I had like the receding hairline.  Yeah.  And I could actually fix it.  Oh, you pull it down.  Pull it down and make, like put a nice juicy curl in a bald spot and then take a nice hunk  in the back and fill that up and then spray it and then hair dry it.  But then like sometimes it'd be on a date and you'd be waiting for a cab.  Do you look out the window and go, Oh, it's windy today. 
[00:29:30]  Oh boy.  And then you got to walk with your head down into the wind, like a weather vane.  So, so the hair kind of blows in the direction of where it's supposed to be covering.  Yes.  I, I was just doing all that.  Yeah.  You sleep with, you sleep over at chick's house and she stays over.  You're going to wake up the next day before her to go in the bathroom and repair the damage  that she did with her hands. 
[00:30:00]  Put another juicy curl somewhere.  Get a fat, juicy curl and mush it up in there.  Oh, you get out of the shower and you just look and go, Oh God, you got to dry your hair  a lot to frizz it up.  Do you have a, give it more volume.  Do you have a great hair day though, where you get it perfect.  You like this covered everything up.  Oh, it's great.  And then the days where you don't and you got to keep wetting it and flipping it back  and redoing it and then wetting it.  It's like a Rubik's cube of your hair. 
[00:30:30]  Then you reach a point though, where it doesn't work anymore.  You just ran out of real estate to cover up with.  Oh yeah.  Do you ever look at like Norton and get jealous?  Like in your, I used to look at him.  People that shave their head that have hair.  Look at that hair.  I have a luscious head of hair.  It annoys me.  It's luscious.  Of course.  It's, but the fact that he could grow it out if he wanted to.  Yes.  It's like, you don't even, why wouldn't you grow that out?  I'll tell you why.  I have cowlicks and it doesn't work.  Oh, what a shame.  You don't understand. 
[00:31:00]  It was a source of torture my whole life.  I used to, the same thing you would do, but not for the same reasons.  Bobby pinning it.  It was horrible.  Horrible.  Really?  Yeah.  Bobby what?  Bobby pinning it.  Like so that my cowlicks would, I had like a retard bowl haircut and I didn't like the fact  that it was McDonald's M in the front because of my cowlicks.  So I would wet it and then Bobby pin it.  No.  Yeah.  And then what?  Like walk around with a Bobby pin?  Oh, after it dried.  I wanted it to be the ball haircut.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  You wanted a retard haircut.  I didn't mean for it to be a retard.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  So you used to use Bobby pins?  I did.  Yeah.  At one point in my life.  So you'd put Bobby pins in and then dry it to make it, to have a certain style?  Not style.  It was, it would cowlick so I couldn't do anything with it.  Right.  But like flop up.  It was horrible.  It was horrible.  Do you used to look at the guys back in the day?  Because we were around the same age with the feathered hair.  The feathered hair.  The feathered haircut like the Hardy Boys.  Yeah, yeah.  And David Cassidy with that parted down the middle perfectly and they would feather back 
[00:32:00]  All they would need to do is take their fingers, run it through their hair and everything was  fine.  Used to get so jealous.  Come out of a windy day inside and just kind of throw their head back.  Yeah.  No hands.  Just flip their head back and all their hair would just fall into place where it belonged.  And I'm sitting there with this Medusa look where the curls are just coming out like snake heads.  You can't do anything with it.  And then you get the receding going and like I said, wet your head, pulling it down, trying 
[00:32:30]  to cover as much of your forehead as you can.  Yeah.  And then as it dries, it just curls back up and creeps back up your head until you have  this giant forehead and no hair.  But this is the worst part.  Nobody will tell you you're going bald.  Nobody will be like, dude, you should just fix that.  You should do something about that.  Everybody just knows inside that they look at you when you show up, they look at your  head first before they look at your eyes. 
[00:33:00]  I couldn't like, like, okay, the wedding.  Right.  I was, I was supposed to go in to have this done on Thursday, the first day of our vacation.  But then I had the appointment made and everything.  And then I realized, oh Christ, I got a wedding, Opie's wedding on Saturday.  I can't go in with, you know, a bandana on my head or, you know, scab head to the wedding.  So I put it off till Tuesday.  Right.  Now, wearing a tux, I can't wear my hat, you know, I can't wear my 5'11 military hat  with a tuxedo. 
[00:33:30]  Just walk in like Judah Freelander.  Have a world championship hat on.  Yeah, a world champ hat or something.  I'll wear an old top hat like Lincoln, a big stovepipe hat and an old suit like that.  How about a Fruit of Islam hat?  Yeah, there you go.  Like Louis Farrakhan's bodyguard.  Farrakhan's bodyguard hat.  Yeah.  A fez.  Let's go with a tux.  It was one of those situations where I was like, okay, now I got to, you know, do this.  And I usually sit in the back of the church anyway, but I sit back there because it was 
[00:34:00]  less people that could then look at the back of my head.  So I sit in the back of the church pretty much.  But then Patrice and Voss, I see them sitting behind me and I'm just going, I know they're  just looking at this glaring ball spot and just, you resign yourself to the fact, you  just go.  But at least I knew.  I went, you know something though?  Tuesday.  I know I'm going.  So it didn't bother me as much.  Yeah.  Isn't it the paranoia that sets in?  You think about it a lot. 
[00:34:30]  Well, I didn't even look at it, but they, they, you're like, oh, the back of your head  feels like it, there's just like a laser beam on it.  Yeah.  And people are just staring at it.  I get, I get my hair cut and like, I'd just be looking at the mirror in front of me as  she's cutting my hair.  And then she goes, okay, you're done.  And hands me the mirror to look at the back.  And I would look off somewhere else in the mirror.  So I wasn't looking at the reflection and just go, oh yeah, that's good.  Cause I didn't want to look at how bad the back was getting. 
[00:35:00]  I just didn't want to acknowledge it or see it or anything.  So I wouldn't look.  She was just faking, cutting your hair in the back.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, what is she closing the scissors so you could hear the sound?  Cause I'd be back there.  I'd be sitting there going, she's doing something back there, but.  No, I hear clip, clip, clip, but, uh, no, but yours, the way you went bald is better  than the way I went bald because I went, you can look at mine.  I have, I have a, just a baby curl in the front. 
[00:35:30]  Like Phil Collins.  Yes.  I have like Charlie Brown.  Yes.  Phil Collins, too prestigious.  See, it's just mean.  Yeah.  Funny, but mean.  So you got a little tuft in the front.  If I grew my hair out right now, which I kind of might want to do.  Yeah.  Just one time, just grow it out as much as I can.  It would just be like a, a, an elephant trunk of hair growing out of the, like a, just a  lazy unicorn coming out of the front of my head and then it's, and then it's bald. 
[00:36:00]  Then I have hair.  And then I think the back here, actually when I started shaving my head though, I actually,  my hair just died.  You look good, boy.  Really?  Your head, you're lucky.  You have a good head.  Pull it off.  But you know what, dude?  I loved having hair.  Well, God didn't want you to.  So let it go.  You look better bald.  Yeah.  But having hair, dude.  It's what?  It's overrated.  It's a stupid thing nature puts on you.  So the heat doesn't evaporate from your top of your skull.  That's really nice coming from a guy that has a full head of hair.  Luscious is the word you're looking for.  Luscious, a luscious, lush head of hair. 
[00:36:30]  Great set of hair.  When you're losing it, it sucks.  I know guys in their 20s that are just like almost completely bald.  And it's like, at least I was able to hold off, you know, into my 40s.  My father was totally bald by 22.  Totally.  My brother, he had, you know, a long head of hair.  It went on him.  He shaves his head.  He's getting like wild sideburn facial hair things.  So it works with him.  With me, though, I couldn't shave.  My friend Joe Curry, same thing. 
[00:37:00]  He used to get so annoyed.  Like, he started going bald pretty early.  And he'd comb his hair.  And he'd go, God damn it, more hair!  And his brush.  And he would just yell, I'm going bald!  Damn it!  He would yell to everybody that he was going bald.  And he went with the shaved head thing.  And everybody, and I just looked and went, if I shave my head,  just put me in a hospice.  Yeah.  Because, uh, that's, get me one of the AIDS cocktails. 
[00:37:30]  I'm not the shaved head kind of guy.  Shaving your head is great because you just, you go,  I mean, you never have to do anything.  You just wake up and go.  And you get a razor in the shower.  You go with a shaved head, though.  I know.  You gotta have a certain type of head.  Yes.  Yeah, but I just miss having, uh, uh, just having hair.  Yeah.  Just having, I mean, just even like a small, like, not like a big set.  Just like a.  Yeah.  Being able to.  And it was hair that, uh, you just don't want to worry about, like, like the windy  days.  Or it's raining out.  If it's raining out, I want to not care. 
[00:38:00]  Rain is the worst.  I want to walk out in the rain.  Wind, wind gusts.  You see the trees bending and all you're thinking is, I'm going to get in my car and  have this swoop of hair coming up and just uncovering, uh, uh, the territories.  We're going to look in that rear view mirror and go, oh boy, this is going to take some  work.  I wanted to get a motorcycle for the longest time, but when I was going bald, I couldn't  get it because of that dumb helmet.  Oh.  Because I had to, I had to prepare my head to go out.  And if I put a helmet on, it would have just been done. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Would have just, that, that side would have been mushed over.  I would, I would go to, uh, uh, restaurants, uh, with my, my hat on and they go, oh sir,  you have to remove your hat.  And that, that's like, I go, oh God.  Okay.  Look, I got to go into the bathroom first.  Just let me go to the bathroom with the hat on.  Cause if I pull off the hat head and then, and then I have to go in and wet my head and  dry it with paper towels and try to fix it, it was too much work. 
[00:39:00]  I left, I left, I've been out with people and like, sir, take your hat off.  I'm out.  I'd leave.  You'd have to leave.  I'd leave.  Wow.  No, because you'd be with some, you know, some girl somewhere or something, you know,  people around, you know, I'd be like, I'm out.  I'm going, well, what's wrong?  I'm not, I'm not taking my hat off right now.  Cause my, my, you know, this side is just revealed and it's just matted over to one side  and it's just a patch missing right here.  Oh, you know, when I was in high school, I wore hats.  I wore hats so much.  It was such a phobia for me to take my hat off that the rehab I went to, they had to 
[00:39:30]  have me in a rehab with a psychiatrist because I wouldn't take my hat off.  Why?  Cause I had insecurity about my cowlicks.  My hair was so awful in high school.  Cowlicks?  I'm telling you, I couldn't style my hair.  I was almost thrown out of high school for, for having a hat.  I had to get a special permission from like a doctor that it was such a mental thing.  I was such a mess that I wouldn't take it off.  He had too much hair and had to wear a hat.  No, I couldn't style it.  I couldn't style it. 
[00:40:00]  I know what he's saying though.  I tried spraying it back.  I know what he's saying.  Like, like, uh, I, I brushed it, but I wanted it to look like a Travolta type thing.  Like, it was just flat and awful and sprayed back and I wouldn't wash it for three  days at a time.  Cause I wanted the hairspray to stay in it.  Like a Travolta thing.  What?  And another man's laughing?  Yeah, exactly.  Me and my friend kissing outside of 727.  I know what he's saying though.  I had, I had, I have a cowlick right in the front and when spiked hair, the punk rock  thing came out back in the day, all my friends got that perfect spiked hairdo. 
[00:40:30]  It went straight up all the way around.  No, I couldn't do it.  They tried to do it, but it would just swoop over one way and it didn't work.  I just, I, I, I was in between hairstyles.  Like if I was born a little earlier, I could have rocked an Afro like a madman and just  been like, you know, cool.  Uh, but I, I, I came in and, uh, when I was growing up a teen, early twenties, stuff  like that, it was so out of style, but that's all my hair would do. 
[00:41:00]  I either was going to have a cut real short in a little Jew boy Afro, that little tight  little Jewish curls thing, or a big Afro.  I wanted long hair.  I want a real long frigging Leonard Skinner.  If it takes like 10 years to grow it with curly hair.  And no, you can't even do it with curly hair.  It would not, it would just grow out.  I looked like that kid from room 222 with the giant Afro.  It was just horrible.  Angela Davis, terrorist Afro. 
[00:41:30]  I had, I had straight hair in my whole childhood until like, I think nine, eight or nine.  Same thing with me.  And then it just, it went curly.  We had the same hair.  Like one summer in a canoe.  It started with this wave in the front.  Yeah.  Like this big wave happened in the front of my head and then the sides curled up and  then the back got this thing.  And then all of a sudden it was a mess that I couldn't get a brush through or a comb.  Yeah.  It looked good for like three months in the transitions between straight and curly. 
[00:42:00]  Nice wavy hair.  Yeah.  People are like, well, your hair looks great.  Oh, thanks.  I don't know.  All the relatives.  Oh, what a nice curly thick head of hair you have.  Shut up.  Do anything with it.  I want straight hair.  Then it's just, I want hair.  I'd love like Asian, the Japanese hair.  You'll see, they get to do whatever they want with their hair.  Make little straight and black.  Oh, it's great.  And then they color it and look silly.  I'll take a little break.  I love when those guys do that.  They spike it up and color it.  And it's like, stop it.  We know that's black hair. 
[00:42:30]  You know who the worst hair is?  It's like a lot of, I don't know where they're from, but they run a lot of the delis in New  York and they try to style it, but it's all like the 80s.  Like remember around the corner from our house on 43rd and like, it was like 11th or 10th.  There's a deli, but they all look like they just stepped out like an aha video.  He had Rod Stewart hair.  It was terrible, like 83 MTV hairs, like 20 years back, stupid.  Because they have the all, in the salons where they come from, they have the old photos from  back in the day in the new salons over there.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:43:00]  I want that haircut right there.  Barbara's back.  Is she?  Is she going to give me that haircut?  Screw her.  Yeah, we got to take a break.  And you want the plug, right?  Oh, yeah.  Quick plug.  Let Bobby give us the plug.  This Friday, December 5th, I will be at the State Theater in Falls Church, Virginia, 8 and  1030.  Is that what you want me to do?  Yeah, that's exactly what I want to do.  Where are you going to be?  I'm going to be at the State Theater in Virginia.  No, I'm going to be in Marco Island at Off the Hook Comedy Club.  Go to offthehookcomedyclub.com.  I'm going to be there Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. 
[00:43:30]  Where's Marco Island?  Florida.  Oh.  Down in Florida and in Naples.  Nice.  I heard it's a pretty fun gig, so we'll see what happens.  Cool, man.  Yeah.  And yeah, we'll take a break.  Be back with the Opie and Anthony show.  And, um...  Nope.  Hi.  Welcome back.  Opie and Anthony show.  Uh, Opie will be back tomorrow.  Don't fret, Opie fans.  He'll be back tomorrow. 
[00:44:00]  He's on his honeymoon.  Talked to him last night.  His lovely bride.  Did you?  Yeah, he's in the airport.  He was delayed in Miami or something.  Ew.  I know.  It's always fun.  Was he, uh...  Was he thrilled to death about, uh, the Boston situation?  And Cleveland.  He was bummed.  I mean, he was, uh...  You know, he was irritated.  He wasn't freaked out.  Cleveland, they just...  They flipped formats.  They completely changed.  Oh, is that what happened?  Yeah, there's no more station that we were even on left over there.  They completely changed.  But the Boston thing was like...  What's the format?  Do we know? 
[00:44:30]  I had no idea.  Something we wouldn't fit into.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Yeah.  What'd you guys get?  You're not in Boston anymore?  Not terrestrial, no.  Nope.  Really?  And that, uh, nice...  Yeah, yeah.  The fine people at, uh, BCN decided...  Bah!  Gonna, you know, save a little cash.  And, uh, put Touch and Rich in the morning.  And then they, um...  Uh, I guess they'll hire some schlub to just spin records for next to nothing in the afternoons.  And, uh, they save money. 
[00:45:00]  CBS is done...  Or not done, but they've...  I don't know who else they can cut.  I don't know who else they can cut.  It's like a game of Jenga.  They keep pulling out all the parts until...  Until the whole thing just collapses.  But, hey, we're here for the collapse.  Oh, I didn't realize it was a format...  Yeah, so he was, uh...  Yeah, look, he was annoyed.  But, I mean, it wasn't...  He wasn't flipping out.  I mean, it was just irritating.  Yeah, yeah.  It's one of those things where you're like...  Ugh.  Ugh.  Do what you want. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, whatever.  Go ahead.  And now, uh, as radio people, we just...  We just hope for failure in any market that we leave.  We just sit there and hope it fails.  Wow.  Isn't that wonderful?  We're real team players.  Uh, whatever's good for the company.  Uh, screw you.  We're terrible.  Uh, I guess, um, Jim in Delaware has a little problem.  Oh, no.  Um, with us.  Oh, no.  We're going to go to Jim.  Oh, Jim.  In Delaware.  Jim.  Let's straighten this out. 
[00:46:00]  What do you say?  Yeah.  I was just saying, uh, relevant to before the break, the Dopey being going, it seemed like,  uh, the show turned into The View.  The View.  Uh, now, why would you, um, why would you say that, sir?  Oh, just because of all the different hair talk and hairstyle talk and, uh, you know.  We were kind of talking about growing up and dealing with, uh, your, your, your bad hair  and then losing it.  I mean, I don't remember Barbara Walters ever addressing that. 
[00:46:30]  So, yeah, Ants, Ants, Ants had a procedure and I was wearing a bandana, so they're kind  of bobbing and I had the same thing.  So, what would you suggest, sir?  Go ahead, Jim from Delaware.  What would you suggest?  Yeah.  I just, it seemed like it was turning into The View.  That's all I had to say.  So, maybe in the next break we could talk about some, uh, makeup tips or something  for the holidays.  That's true.  Yeah, because that's exactly where we were headed, right, uh, Jim?  So, you got a full head of hair, Jim?  Jim, maybe you don't understand.  Do you have a full head of hair?  Uh, yes, I do.  So, are you, are you, are you comfortable?  Are you comfortable, uh, are you, are you, are you comfortable? 
[00:47:00]  Let him start out here because I want to hear what he says.  Oh.  Ah.  That means I didn't miscue.  I want, I want you to just let him start then hang up on him.  Yeah.  So, I can tell him that.  That's the gag.  Yeah, the joke was that he would start talking and I'd go, well, I'd hate, let's not make  it like The View and then move along.  Danny was a little premature.  Yeah.  He shot quickly.  Panicky Danny.  All I'd do was unbuckle your belt, kid.  His point would make it like the hang up.  No, no, but I was, I know, I, there's no way to say it because it was like I wanted him 
[00:47:30]  to start answering.  It's like, when he starts answering, hang up.  Oh, well, when you say it, it doesn't quite work, doesn't have the impact.  How about the signal is this?  Like, I'll, I'll open my hands like parentheses.  That's our signal.  Oh, parentheses.  All right.  Well, Jim, when I was, Jim, call back.  But it's, it's amazing.  If you jump from topic to topic too fast, it's like a stupid zoo crew.  You know what I mean?  Hey, well, we'll talk about this for five minutes.  Yeah.  And then if you stay on it for more than 10 minutes, people get impatient. 
[00:48:00]  Just shut up.  Yeah.  I mean, we're, we're talking here.  It's a talk show.  I just thought it's one of those things also.  We talk about our lives.  This is something I did.  And, uh, you know, a lot of, uh, I go to enough of, uh, appearances with Opie and Anthony  listeners to know that there are people that can relate.  Yes.  You know, believe me.  What do you want us to talk about Plaxico Burris?  He's in trouble.  Oh, he's in Dutch.  Ooh, his gun went off in his pants.  We could actually talk about that because it is kind of, uh, uh, screwy. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  He, um, he's saying that, uh, or, or people are saying, I don't even know who that he  had his gun, a 40 caliber, uh, gun Glock down the front of his pants.  Um, which is just the smartest way to carry a loaded and racked firearm is down the front  of your pants.  What an idiot.  Get a holster.  If you're going to carry a gun, you have to get something, uh, discreet.  If you're trying to hide it, took it down the front of your pants. 
[00:49:00]  Like, Oh, gee, what does he think?  He's trying to protect all his bling.  That's why he said it was carrying.  And you can't afford a leather holster that, that can hold the goddamn thing, uh, without  it falling down.  What happened, it fell down his pant leg, he said, or someone said he went to grab it through  his pant leg and it went off and shot him in the leg, which is hysterical.  I just, I can only wish it, it shot his, uh, his manhood off whenever, whenever I see somebody 
[00:49:30]  shoving, uh, a gun, uh, down their waistband.  That's all I think is the fine way to lose your, uh, your manliness.  Probably would have done nothing to his though.  Oh yeah.  Just, man, man, that's not, they'll just cut that part off.  It just healed itself.  Still, yeah.  Like a, like a lizard tail.  It just grows back.  The bullet would have bounced off the ridge and hit somebody else.  I personally, I don't know.  I don't care if he did.  I don't have a problem with the guy.  He's going to lose like almost $30 million in a contract. 
[00:50:00]  He's not, he wasn't trying to rob somebody.  He was trying to protect himself because you can't go out without some scumbag jamming.  How about this?  How about you, you, you, you do more to stop people from jamming gums in your face and  then people don't have to carry them.  Gums?  Yeah, gums.  Not guns.  People jam gums in my face.  One time a guy put them and he yelled, free dent!  And I handed my money over.  Yes, I said gums like an idiot.  Gums in their face.  There is a law in, uh, New York City though.  You're not allowed to, um, carry a gun unless you have a New York City, uh, license to carry 
[00:50:30]  a firearm, which, which sucks if you ask me because I think once you get a New York  State license, it should be, uh, legit in all the New York State, but you gotta go through  the, their hoops and, and get a New York City license.  He didn't have one.  He had a license that was expired from Florida, which isn't even good in New York State.  It's good in 29 other states, but not New York State.  Uh, and even that wouldn't have been good in the city if it was good in the state.  So, uh, he was, he was breaking the law and there's like mandatory jail term for carrying 
[00:51:00]  an, uh, uh, illegal firearm in New York City and for firing it.  Uh, he had it in a, uh, venue.  So all these things are just going to be, you know, endangerment, things like that.  Uh, he's, he's gonna, and, and Bloomberg is saying he just wants him the book, throw  the book at him.  Why is Bloomberg, shut up Bloomberg.  Yeah.  I don't know why Bloomberg's going to keep ruining traffic, you little baby, because you  had to sit in traffic one time and now you're wrecking it for everybody, you spoiled  billionaire, he's, he's, he's clogging up the roads, building these stupid bike lanes and 
[00:51:30]  putting giant potted plants in the street.  Picnic tables.  What are you doing?  You out of touch dub?  What are you doing?  It's New York City.  He's, he's ruining, he's ruining, uh, the city for people that have to drive in it.  Yeah, because he, he, again, he's an overprivileged little billionaire brat who has security.  So if he needs to get somewhere, they'll clear the way for him.  When he takes the subway, he's got eight guys with pistols taking the subway with him.  He has no problem.  Like if he's ever stuck in traffic, just going, oh, damn. 
[00:52:00]  Those are the most comfortable picnic tables to sit into right in the middle of the road.  Just a little tin table with cabs flying by you at 30 miles an hour.  Just waiting for some cabbie or some 80 year old that does, I mistook the gas for the break.  To plow into you.  Oh, because you know it's only tourists sitting there anyway.  I can't wait till it happens.  It'll happen once and then people will be, so what happens, that will be a big waste.  What are you going to do in the winter?  You going to have little tables out there when it's five below in January, or is that just going to be wasted real estate?  I hope we have a good snowstorm that covers them up and a dumb plow driver comes by that has no idea they're there and just tears them up. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, this is some hard ice.  All the tables go flying, dummy.  Yeah, Bloomberg is, I don't know what to make of him.  Sometimes I really agree with him, and sometimes I just think he is a douche.  Yeah.  Whereas Giuliani, I pretty much agreed with a lot of what he had to say and what he was doing, but a lot of people thought he was a douche. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  But I have mixed feelings with Bloomberg.  I'm not sure about him.  At least Giuliani went after quality of life crimes.  And this guy is, like, changing the street patterns because he's, like, you pointed out what a baby he is.  His little plan didn't go through.  Yeah.  He's not trying to relieve traffic.  He doesn't care that people are sitting in traffic.  What are you going to do, force everyone to ride a bike?  You idiot.  Yeah.  We don't live in Vermont.  This is New York.  It's a city.  People honk and drive, and there's traffic. 
[00:53:30]  The only place you see people biking in New York is in the gay areas.  The gay areas have the bike trails, and they like biking and rollerblading and things like that in the gay areas.  I live in the gay areas.  Well, whatever.  That seems to be what happens when you drive down the West Side Highway, and there are certain people riding their bikes and walking hand-in-hand, walking small dogs. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Hard as to cruise on a bike.  Yeah.  Well, that's what they do.  But New York, he has these adjusted traffic patterns to make it more of a pain in the ass to drive because his plan didn't go through.  His commuter tax is pretty much what it is.  He wants everybody to pay to come into Manhattan, which, you know, I don't care.  It would be before.  I would get in before the thing was enacted because it was supposed to be 6 a.m. 
[00:54:30]  And I'm in before that, so, ha-ha, I wouldn't have to pay.  And there'd be less traffic.  I like that.  I say get rid of the cabs.  Everyone drive.  Remember that Sunday Giuliani did that?  They were on the strike, and he was like, you know what?  Screw it.  No cabs in the city on Sunday, and it was nothing.  It was so quiet and so relaxing.  Yeah, but you can't get around, dude.  If everybody drove a cab, everyone driving would be a disaster.  As much as I hate cabs, one cab will take care of 50 people that would have cars. 
[00:55:00]  You can't have just no cabs.  Yeah, it would be crazy.  Believe me, I can't stand cabs when I'm driving.  I just want them off the goddamn road.  They really only know how to drive in certain situations.  They'll cut right in front of you when they see a fare, especially in the morning when there's barely any fares.  They will pull across four lanes right in front of you just to get to that one guy, and you just want to kill him. 
[00:55:30]  I've yelled racial epithets out my window for cab drivers.  Oh, my God.  I've called them horrific things.  And they yell back at me, but what are they going to do?  I see their number.  They don't want to lose their cab medallion.  What do I got to lose?  Because, you know, I drive away.  I drive away laughing.  Not hair anymore.  Thank you.  Thank you.  But let's not get into the view talk anymore.  Yeah, God forbid we talk about real life stuff.  We could talk about manly stuff. 
[00:56:00]  We were talking about guns.  I took the .50 Cal to the range yesterday.  A .50 Cal what?  Desert Eagle.  I picked up the Desert Eagle.  I got one.  We were actually making fun of you because you have the new Call of Duty 5.  Yeah, yeah.  Everybody's playing.  And someone looked up your score.  Oh, it's a stink.  It's horrific.  Yeah, you're just awful.  You have, like, one kill.  Dude, it's the worst.  I am so bad at it. 
[00:56:30]  It's like somebody in the knee.  Yeah, in the knee.  I'm terrible.  I can't play console games.  I will surround somebody.  I'll get the jump on someone.  Surround them in bullets.  And then they'll turn around and one shot me right in the head.  I can't aim with that goddamn controller.  Put me on a keyboard and a mouse on a regular PC game.  Or a real gun.  Or a real gun.  And I will hit things.  But that goddamn controller, I cannot aim with it. 
[00:57:00]  It's not.  It's too.  It's overly sensitive.  Where I'm trying to run and aim at the same time with a keyboard and a mouse, it's like an extension of my arms and legs.  It's just a curve.  You've got to learn the curve.  I started to with Call of Duty 4.  Right.  Then I slacked off.  Right.  And then Call of Duty 5, I get on there, and I am just dead meat.  I am constantly getting killed.  I can't kill anybody.  I don't know any of the maps.  So I just run around.  I don't understand how I don't come across anybody that's sitting and sniping. 
[00:57:30]  Yet when I'm sitting and sniping, everyone walks up and stabs me.  You've got to get a couple of bouncing Bettys and stick them around you so they can't sneak up a bouncing Betty.  You get the mines out there?  Yeah, you've got to get a bouncing Betty.  You put it around you so if someone sneaks up, they blow up.  See, that's what I've got to do.  You can't just snipe by yourself out in a lonely courtyard.  But that's the stuff I didn't figure out.  I'm running around, and then I'm saying, oh, it's got to be my weapon.  Because it sucks.  Because I hit somebody ten times in the chest, he one-shots me, I'm gone. 
[00:58:00]  Because he has juggernaut on, and you don't.  You're a juggernaut.  No.  I hate juggernaut.  Why?  When I see that little red cross show up when I'm shooting somebody, I just run away.  I go, I'm not even going to try, because I'm going to end up dead.  Why?  It's not real life.  It's not real life.  Run away.  It's annoying.  It's annoying.  And I put on things like accuracy and harder hitting, and I'm still there.  Ra-da-da-da-da.  Ra-da-da-da-da. 
[00:58:30]  Chick-chick.  Chick-chick.  Ra-da-da-da-da-da-da.  And he turns around.  Boom.  I'm gone.  Dead.  He got me with a shotgun from 200 yards, and I'm dead.  Oh, no.  I hate that game.  So you look at my name up and laugh at me, you bastards.  We're not the gay clan.  They banned the word gay.  The word gay in any way, shape, or form.  You can't do gay clan at all.  So now it's the F, little star.  F-star.  S.  Oh, okay.  So you still know what it is. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, I do.  Okay.  Kyle from Westchester has played Call of Duty.  Let me see.  Hey, Kyle.  What's going on, Anthony?  What's up, man?  You've had the pleasure of playing Call of Duty with me?  Yes, Mr. Noodles.  Yes, I have.  And what happened?  You were running around just trying to slash people.  They're standing in front of you laughing at you.  You're so horrible that they give you pity shots and you still miss.  No one's giving me pity shots, my friend.  Oh, come on.  And the only reason I'll try to stab someone is I'll miscue with the controller when I mean to shoot someone, hit the wrong thing, and my knife comes out. 
[00:59:30]  And I'm going, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, from five feet away.  And the guy hears it, turns around and shoots me.  And I go, mother!  Mother, I'm screaming curses in my house like a child because I can't play.  You take your knife out when you...  You know that...  Like, I'll hit the controller wrong.  What's that?  They got a game that you would like on Call of Duty 5.  It's a Nazi zombie game. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, yeah?  Have you heard about that one?  Yeah.  You beat the game, you and some of your gay brothers.  I'll play that one because, I don't know, I love playing multiplayer.  I used to play Half-Life online and Call of Duty, I mean, Counter-Strike, things like that.  And it was keyboard and mouse, so it was fine.  The second I get that goddamn console, I am dead meat.  I can't aim with it.  Look, I got a great 13-year-old child agreeing with me. 
[01:00:30]  JC...  I think you're just making it too complicated for yourself.  Oh, thanks, Kyle.  No, it's the controller.  JC from Jersey, what's up, man?  Hey, boys.  Anthony, by the way, you are totally right.  I hate Call of Duty 5.  The controls suck.  There is a setting you can change the sensitivity.  The controls still suck.  It makes no difference.  Look, Grandpa here knows about the settings.  I hate Call of Duty and I still suck because it takes so much work to get one kill.  It's the way the controller is set up. 
[01:01:00]  It's not as good.  You can't hone in on your target like you can with a mouse.  And that's the reason that you have a mouse on a computer and not a controller.  Because you can do...  You have a 360, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, but the Juggernaut, it's better actually if you have the PlayStation thing.  Shut up, Timmy.  You don't...  You haven't even played, you homo.  This kid is the...  That's the voice I hate hearing. 
[01:01:30]  That's the voice coming through that's just like, you suck.  How old are you, man?  And they're cursing until their mom gets home and then they're going to be all nice.  You just hear it.  He just killed you 17 times in a row.  Yeah.  And then you hear, come on, Ma, one more game.  You suck.  Yeah, that's what I get all the time.  I remember when Gears of War multiplayer was like the thing to be doing.  Yeah.  I played maybe three rounds.  And I gave up because I would get my ass handed to me.  And then I would just hear like kids way younger than you, JC.  They had to be like 10, 9, 10. 
[01:02:00]  And they're just going, man, you suck.  You suck.  Man, why are you so bad?  You suck.  And I'm like, you know what?  JC, make like you just totally owned me and talk some smack.  Come on, boys.  Bring it on.  I'm way better than you.  You all suck.  I could beat you.  What about them apples, hmm?  That's it.  That's the voice.  I want to find the house and really shoot him.  Bring out the 50 count.  I call them the high-pitched Henrys. 
[01:02:30]  They're the worst.  They have their mic way too loud.  Yeah, it's all distorting.  And then they just start singing songs.  Oh, and they won't shut up.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  It's when the little kids have the mic close enough that you can hear them breathing.  And it sounds like a mule.  I do that.  I put the mic instead on my mouth.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  I put the mic under my nostril.  Oh, I remember when you were doing that one day.  Bobby put the mic right under his nostril.  And the whole game, you could just hear... 
[01:03:00]  It was so annoying.  People were just like, stop breathing into the mic.  You're awful.  All right, JC.  Maybe I'll see you online, you little bastard.  All right.  Peace out, Ant.  All right, man.  Yeah, it is extremely annoying.  Keyboard and mouse, though, I will own you.  But I can't play...  Nice mouthful of eggs there, Bobby.  I can't play with the same people I can play on with the Xbox. 
[01:03:30]  And that's what I want to do.  I want to get online with Bobby and stuff and the rest of the people from the show, things like that, and play.  So I couldn't play on the computer.  But that's the reason a computer has a mouse and a keyboard.  When you're looking for an icon to click on, when you're looking for Internet Explorer on your computer,  I never pass it by and overshoot it and click on something else and go, damn it!  It's easy.  It's the same way with the reticle that you're aiming with.  It's easier with a mouse.  No, it's not.  Yes, it is. 
[01:04:00]  It is not.  It's not.  Then put a controller on your computer.  Then put a goddamn console game controller on your computer and use that to navigate.  That's two different things.  It's easier to...  No, you're aiming at an icon and hitting the fire button is what you're doing when you're clicking on anything on your computer.  But if you learn how to do it...  Because I used to play like you.  I used to do the mouse and the keyboard.  I had all that stuff.  I used to play Soldier of Fortune on the computer.  And then I switched over to Xbox and it took me a little bit, but it's way easier. 
[01:04:30]  A little bit.  I've been a year at this.  A year and I suck!  You play like twice and you get all frustrated and you leave because you don't have a bouncing Betty.  Dude, I was playing for a long time Call of Duty 4.  You got good at Call of Duty 4.  I never got good.  I got at the point where I wasn't being goofed on all the time.  You're right.  But I was consistently in the bottom three names of kills.  I love when you used to play though because you could just stab you.  I was very easily stabbed.  Because you look around. 
[01:05:00]  Because if I don't look around, I get shot or stabbed by Dane.  You're not buying a house.  You don't look around in every room.  Some of the real estate was quite nice.  You're over in the corner looking at the plumbing, making sure it works all right.  I was looking for a place for cover so that when someone comes in the door, I could shoot them.  And then they pop through the window and stab me.  I was looking for one place where I could get some cover and maybe take a shot at somebody.  Stabbing you is the best.  It's all I heard all night. 
[01:05:30]  And then I have to watch it happening to me.  And I click off it.  No, I'm not watching the replay of my death.  I remember playing Call of Duty 4 Bobby and it would be quiet for a while and you'd just go,  Hey, Danny.  And I'm like, yeah.  He'd go, turn around.  And I turn around and he's just sitting there with the gun headshot dead.  You suck.  And then to add insult to injury, he would let me know that he'd been stalking me for  like four minutes.  That's the best when you're walking beside somebody for like a minute and a half and  they're looking for you and you're right behind them. 
[01:06:00]  And then you just go, Hey, dude, what's up?  Fuck hunk.  Yeah.  I'd lay down somewhere for cover and then you guys would pass me by and go, Anthony, why  are you laying there?  Nothing happens here.  And then I stand up and get shot in the head.  Great.  We, uh, we got to take another break, but, uh, we will return.  Don't fret.  Bobby's going to eat.  And now we're going to tell you about some fine products.  The Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:06:30]  Hey, Opie and Anthony show.  Being joined here by Bobby Kelly today.  And of course, Jim Norton, as always.  I'm here.  Yes.  I'm actually doing a class at Yale tomorrow.  Yeah.  I heard about that.  Uh, why?  What is that?  What kind of class?  Uh, physics.  Professor Jan is doing a physics class.  That would be good.  You go in there knowing nothing and just try your BS that you try on all of us here. 
[01:07:00]  It's like childlike physics.  If you throw a ball, gravity will pull it to the ground.  And they're all sitting there with notebooks going, wait a minute.  What is he talking about?  Of course it will.  It's some comedy class.  I did that Carlin tribute at the 92nd Street Y and the same guy that runs that does something  at Yale.  And it was, uh, I guess they're performers or whatever.  And they're just talking about comedy.  Modern day comedy.  Really?  Are you the only one?  Who doesn't?  No.  No.  Are you the one who's going to speak about comedy?  Are they going to have other comedians? 
[01:07:30]  No.  Yeah.  It's just me.  It's just, it's just like a one class.  It's their last class.  What is the class called?  I don't know.  Actually, it's not a big one.  It's just...  Wow.  You don't know what the class is called?  What?  High class?  I don't know.  I'm not going to be prepared.  I'm just...  Maybe something like African American studies.  Oh.  Where you walk in there to just, you know, maybe a hostile environment.  Nah.  I'm not worried about it.  I'm just talking about comedy.  I'm just talking about that forever.  It's fun.  Are you going to have a podium?  I don't know, actually.  I'm going to have a couple of notes, John.  But I'm not going to give it a long speech.  Lenny Bruce transcended.  Yeah, did he? 
[01:08:00]  Yeah, really?  He knows everything already.  If you did that, if you went in prepared with a big speech and just gave it like an hour  and a half speech.  Oh, just going on and on.  Write the most boring driveless you could possibly find.  And then just bore the class to death.  Like a long run-on sentence.  No capital letters.  No paragraphs.  And don't even be funny.  Just take yourself way too serious.  And the art of comedy has to be performed with vigor. 
[01:08:30]  I found...  Slowly take a sip of water.  Pour it from a big pitcher.  And at the end...  While they just wait.  I'll be taking questions.  And then, like, after two hours, when there's like five minutes left, just go for questions.  So what got you into comedy?  I always felt funny.  I want to thank you all for having me.  I'm going to give you the worst class you've ever had.  Bore fest.  It's going to be a snoozeroo. 
[01:09:00]  You look at the audience.  There's just one African dude left.  There might only be like ten people.  It's a small...  I don't think it's a giant...  Yeah, it's a small class.  It's not like a giant...  Little get-together.  Yeah, but it's Yale.  So, of course, I want to do it because it's Yale.  I mean...  Good for your resume.  You're going to get a sweatshirt?  I hope so.  Yeah, no, taught at Yale.  Will you be...  Yeah, will you be given an honorary doctorate?  Where's my cap with the little tassel?  I want to throw it in the air.  I wanted that from, like, my high school. 
[01:09:30]  Like, I remember when I first came back to New York, one thing we were trying to do  was get me my high school diploma from John H. Glenn School in Elwood.  You don't have a diploma?  No.  You didn't graduate high school?  Nope.  Nope.  God, this country's amazing.  And I have no equivalency diploma either.  This is just an amazing country.  You're sitting here with a bandana on your head with new hair.  New hair growing in.  And you didn't do anything you were supposed to.  Nothing.  I did everything I wasn't supposed to do.  And I got a crappy job. 
[01:10:00]  I depended too much on a rock band with nothing to fall back on.  I did everything I wasn't supposed to do.  You're a funny bum.  Yeah.  You're absolutely right.  And my lifestyle just proves that, too.  I've been called...  I was like a college student that won the lotto.  Like, that type of lifestyle.  Where I just have no idea what I should be doing.  So I just do things for fun. 
[01:10:30]  I buy toys.  You're just an Adam Sandler film.  Yeah, pretty much.  I never graduated high school.  And it was mostly because of gym.  I just didn't go to the gym class.  Why?  Gym's the best.  But it wasn't.  Why?  It sucked.  It was the class that I cut out the most so I could smoke weed.  But I also cut out a social study.  And then I would cut out one day. 
[01:11:00]  And then two days in a row.  And then you can't go back now.  So you find yourself a week in, two weeks in, not having gone to the class.  And now you avoid the whole side of the building.  Because if you bump into the teachers, you'll be like, where have you been?  Why haven't you been in class?  And then you finally, like, it's like finally paying a ticket that suspended your license and getting everything in order.  You finally make your piece with the teacher and this one and go, okay, you can make up the class still. 
[01:11:30]  Just come in.  And I would screw it up again.  I would be outside smoking weed with my friends, who, by the way, would cut out of one class, come out, smoke weed with me, and then go to the rest of the day.  And then the other friends would come out and smoke weed with me.  And then they'd go.  And I was out there, though, for every class.  You were the gatekeeper.  Like, I was like, how did you graduate?  I was always smoking pot with you.  It's like, yeah, but I went to class.  You were always smoking pot with me and all of our other friends because you never went to any of the classes. 
[01:12:00]  And that's why I never graduated.  You know how easy it is to graduate high school?  I know.  I graduated.  Retards graduated.  I graduated high school.  Literal retards.  I said it once, and then I went, wait, and then I said it again.  I'm Brody.  I'm Brody.  One time my dad went to a parent-teacher conference at my high school, and I was really hoping he wasn't going to hit all the classes because there was a science class that I had actually never had.  never been to.  Oh, we all know this. 
[01:12:30]  So we walk over to the science class.  We sit down.  The teacher's looking at me like, I don't know who you are.  And I had to explain to my father that I never showed up for the class in the first place.  I don't know who you are.  I think that was a problem at registration.  I never really signed up for that class.  I just didn't feel like going.  I was doing really good in school, and my brother was such a bad influence.  He got busted for weed in junior high. 
[01:13:00]  He was one of the first people, because we were from a really white neighborhood and real middle-classy kind of neighborhood.  And he got busted for pot in junior high, and it was a big deal.  Like, people were like, oh, my God, did you hear?  Joe Kumi got busted for marijuana.  And I was coming up from the elementary school, and when I got into junior high, all the teachers took me aside and go, and they were really like, we really hope you're not like your brother.  They remember, it was like legend, that he was busted for weed. 
[01:13:30]  Like, we really hope.  And I wasn't.  I was a science geek.  I loved, like, chemistry sets and microscopes and telescopes and things.  So I was doing really well until I went out to California, and my mother shipped my brother out to California because he was being unruly and needed a father figure.  I just went out because I kind of wanted to live with my dad for a while.  So he comes out there and buys weed and stashes it in my Estes model rockets. 
[01:14:00]  That's how much of a geek I was.  I was into model rocketry.  They didn't even do anything?  It was just a model of a rocket?  No, it was a model rocket, and you put the little engines in there and the igniters, and you send them up.  When people ask, why are you putting a little mushroom cap on the end and squatting over it and light it?  Give me that D-engine model.  Oh, that feels good.  No, I never used them in that fashion.  It was always a great treat when they would go up in the air, and the nose cone popped off, and the parachute came out, and it drifted slowly back to earth to be used again and again. 
[01:14:30]  I was into model rocketry.  So I had all these rockets in my room, and in the nose cones, my brother would hide his weed.  So one day, I'm going through one of my rockets, and I find a joint, and I was thinking, you know, I hear you don't get stoned the first time you smoke first.  I go, and I kind of, you know, Joe always seems kind of in a good mood when he smokes this stuff, so let me give it a try. 
[01:15:00]  I didn't want to smoke with him because I didn't want it to be a big thing.  Like, here's the big brother and the little brother smoking pot together.  I didn't want to smoke with anyone else.  So I went down into this pump house in a riverbed.  It was like this tin shack that was maybe four by four with a big valve in it.  That was it.  And it was pitch black, so I went in there, I lit up, and smoked the whole joint.  And I was sitting down in the pitch blackness, so I really couldn't tell that I was getting high, but apparently I was. 
[01:15:30]  Because when I opened the door, it was like when the Wizard of Oz changed to color.  It just, it went from pitch blackness, and I just went, wow, like I end up in this bamboo riverbed field, just looking up at the clouds and sky, and just saying, I've got to get into this pot thing.  Pot was a great thing. 
[01:16:00]  All the drugs, I mean, you know, I don't miss the heavy ones, but pot, I remember getting so high one day, I saw a pot.  You've got to tell people, dude, I am so high.  First of all, I pretended I was, I thought it was an airplane.  I was flying down the street with wings.  I was going, boom.  A Dumbo jet.  Right, it's a little bit.  And then I saw a Popeye on my feet as I was walking.  What the hell kind of Popeye was going on? 
[01:16:30]  I thought it was a Popeye cartoon.  The left foot was Popeye, and the right one was olive oil.  And I, because you know, they,  That's all I was doing as I was walking down the street.  Oh, you're pretty stone there, Bob's key.  Have another giant sk.  I need no Popeye's voice.  Well, blow me down.  I'm pretty high, Bluto.  Oh, Bobby's a pretty stone sk. 
[01:17:00]  You want to smoke some hash geesh?  Yeah, you get, you get like so high that you have to tell everyone how high you are,  but they're also high, so it didn't matter.  I just decided where, like, pot replaced everything.  Like, pot ruined me as far as my education went,  because I went from science geek, really enjoying, not enjoying going to school. 
[01:17:30]  I didn't like getting up early.  I still don't.  But I went to classes.  I did very well.  The teachers liked me.  I was creative.  Things like that.  To just a lazy lump of crap that had no ambition to do anything but find and smoke more pot.  But when I told my brother that I found a joint and smoked it,  he was so excited that he had someone to smoke with that he's right away, 
[01:18:00]  we had to, like, smoke one together, and then it became like, you know,  now me and Joe are smoking weed the whole time.  Did you become all-time high buddies?  Remember you used to burn each other with a joint?  No!  Never did that?  We're brothers.  We're not burning each other with joints.  Although I hooked up with his friends.  All of my friends got ditched,  and I hooked up with his friends who were all the stoner kids.  So I, you know, was now getting stoned, hanging out with the stoner kids.  I got kicked out of my school and sent to what they called continuation school, 
[01:18:30]  which we called a con school because it sounded rough and tumble.  Con school.  And all they made you do was sit there and do dittos.  Like, they handed out dittos, and they were like fifth-  What the hell's a ditto?  Fifth-grade dittos.  What's a ditto?  A ditto is a thing with the printed blue ink on it.  I'll tell you what a ditto is.  If you're standing next to a retarded guy, and he says,  I'm retarded, you'd go, ditto. 
[01:19:00]  I don't know what a-  What the hell is a ditto?  It's what you use on your wife if you have a cold.  No?  Wow.  A ditto.  Hang on one second.  That's funny.  A ditto is a piece of paper.  In the old days, before printers and stuff like that,  they had a ditto machine, a mimeograph machine.  Yeah, Jim, why would I know that? 
[01:19:30]  It printed the blue-  Why does everyone know that?  Who knows?  Not everybody knows ditto.  Who doesn't know what a ditto is?  A ditto machine?  Yes.  Yes.  Bob, when I was in high school, I remember ditto paper.  When you got your test and you smelled it, you ever smell your test when you used to  get it?  No.  It was the blue ink.  I was in Julie Hall at 13.  I didn't go to school.  That's why.  You were smelling other things.  Everyone knows dittos.  Oh, I don't know.  I didn't.  I swear to God, I don't.  I'll admit it.  What am I going to do?  It's blue ink that was on white paper, and it smelled of like alcohol-ish kind of thing.  Never. 
[01:20:00]  Never.  And the letters were always a little smeary.  Never.  No?  Never seen a ditto machine.  I've never heard of somebody that didn't know a ditto.  I never have either, to be honest with you.  The mimeograph.  It was like that blue inky stuff that they put on a drum, and the drums spun.  It was an oldie-style printer.  I don't remember that.  Wow.  I don't remember that.  I mean, I missed.  I literally, I missed from 6th, 7th grade until maybe 10th grade.  But you should have gotten those in like 3rd grade.  They handed out dittos, and it was what tests were on. 
[01:20:30]  What were tests on when you were in like 3rd grade?  I had the little, I'll tell you what, well, we had tests, but then we had that yearly thing  where you hit the, you do little X's.  Oh, what, you gotta fill out the, Scantron.  Yeah, Scantron.  Scantron.  I didn't have a ditto.  Scantron has become aware.  That's a ditto right there.  See, it's that bluish ink, and it really, it smelled cool.  Everyone smelled them when they got them. 
[01:21:00]  I don't remember.  You never remember take one and pass it back?  No, but there's, I'm just, no.  I never, I remember that.  I remember doing that in my life.  What did you do it with?  Ditto smell like magic marker.  Things.  Take one and pass it back.  We're in a daisy chain here.  Swallow a little and then spit the rest in your friend's mouth.  Take the cracker if you win.  Nah, I never, I don't remember a ditto machine.  Well, anyway, it was, it was all dittos, which means the teachers never put any work  into the assignments, because they were all losers, too. 
[01:21:30]  That's how they ended up at this continuation school.  Most of them were these surfer, old surfer hippie dudes, and they would hand out these  dittos, and the second you finished them, you could leave, and they were fifth grade  dittos.  They were horrible.  Like, you didn't learn anything there.  We stopped saying dittos, now it's bugging me.  Ditto, ditto, ditto.  The word ditto.  D-I-T-T-T-O.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Now it doesn't sound like a word anymore.  I've said it too many times.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Ah, bugged me.  That's a stupid word.  Ditto.  On your wife, you have a cold.  It's going to make me laugh all day.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Ditto. 
[01:22:00]  But that was my experience in continuation school, and that was because of the weed.  I had to go there, and then I dropped out, came back to New York, tried school again,  dropped out, just couldn't do it.  And the dean of boys, Pete Polina, he told me to leave.  He asked me to leave school for a year, for the rest of the year, get a job, find out what  it's really like to be out there, and then you come back next year and finish school. 
[01:22:30]  And me being out in the real world, I was like, wait a minute, I'm making money, I can  buy cigarettes, whiskey for the weekends, you know, I can do whatever I want, I can  smoke pot and watch TV all day and not get in trouble for it.  Next year rolled around, I'm like, yeah, I'm giving this a try.  A week later, I was like, see ya.  I've been in the real world, people.  There's a whole world out there, kids.  Let me tell you about it.  That's who I was in school.  I did the same thing.  Did you graduate, Bobby?  I actually went back, because, you know, I got sober, but I went out and they told 
[01:23:00]  me, you know what, just take off for the rest of the year, because I beat up the gym teacher.  He was, I caught him, I caught him trying to beat up my friend in the hallway, like he  was messing with him, so then I pulled up and there was two of us, and we just started  pushing him around.  You got the gym teacher.  Are they usually former, like, somethings?  Yeah, he was a big guy.  Ball players.  He was a big guy.  Yeah.  But the kid, yeah, but he, when there was two of us, he kind of backed down, and we  got caught by the assistant principal, who was definitely a dyke, big lesbian lady, and 
[01:23:30]  the principal was this hot milf, with just a beehive haircut, which she was a moron.  Penthouse video school did you go to?  Historically.  But we went in.  The lesbian throws down the milf, and Bob gets a spanking and a strap-on lesson.  Lessons for Robert.  Laying on dittos.  I hate that word.  Why?  Get your face, you have Ditto ink on your cheeks.  Ditto ink all over you.  Yes. 
[01:24:00]  But, yeah, I went back.  I left school.  They said, just leave for the rest.  They gave me a stack of papers, one paragraph, five questions about that one paragraph.  Wow.  And she goes, if you do all these, hand them in the day before the last day of school,  and you can, we'll just move you to this next day.  I never got that.  I always got, you have to finish everything you missed, idiot.  No.  Everyone else got these deals.  They were able to cut deals like the DA was running this school.  Can I cut a deal?  Yeah, all right.  If you cop to not going to social studies, we'll give you math. 
[01:24:30]  All right.  Deal.  I cut a deal.  Again, I went back in.  They said, you can come to class two classes, and then you can leave and go work.  So, I did that for ninth grade, and then I worked my way back into the regular rooms,  and then I graduated with my class.  Yeah.  And then I got a scholarship to a community college for art.  Community college scholarship.  Stop it.  That was the worst.  That's the worst.  It was like $1,500, and then I got financial aid from the state.  Another $1,500 I just slammed in my pocket, bought no books with. 
[01:25:00]  Taking the money.  Good deal.  I came in the next day with a brand new briefcase and a trench coat.  And rich.  We got to take a break.  We'll be right back.  Opie and Anthony show.  Good morning.  Opie and Anthony show.  Poor Jimmy, man. 
[01:25:30]  He has such trials and tribulations with his iPhone.  Yeah.  I love my iPhone.  Yeah, but you're annoyed, too, at the time.  I keep getting kicked offline.  I was just went online.  All of a sudden, it just goes to black, and then it's my home screen again.  I've had this constant nightmare.  You're all updated and everything.  Everything's updated.  Return your phone.  This is my fifth unit. 
[01:26:00]  I went through three of the other ones.  I don't know how to handle them.  I don't break them.  I don't drop them.  They replaced them.  I mean, Apple's good for that.  And then I bought the 3G.  And the first one, the reception was so bad that I actually threw it against the bathroom  floor and broke it.  So I bought a new one.  It was a $500 temper tantrum.  So then they gave me this one.  And it's just the same thing.  It's AT&T.  I don't know what to tell you.  Yeah, you don't like the service.  How can you?  How can you?  How can you? 
[01:26:30]  It treats the west side of Manhattan like you're in Beirut.  But then I'm here.  I'm dying for this new BlackBerry.  And then I'm hearing the new BlackBerry is a push.  Like, you have to push on the screen.  It's like, what are you doing?  It's not a regular touch screen like the iPhone is.  It's got some type of feedback to it where it almost clicks like a pop-o-matic.  Pop-o-matic.  Pops the dice.  Pop a six and you move twice.  Race your man around the track and try to send the others back.  Trouble. 
[01:27:00]  Bobby just gave me a look.  The fact that you're like some form of a genius and you didn't even graduate high school  blows me away.  Well, that's why.  What you could have been.  That I remembered.  What you could have been.  Things like math and science and history, I couldn't remember because I had pop-o-matic  songs stuck in my head.  And the Polaroid song, meet the swinger, Polaroid swinger.  Do you remember that one?  No.  I just sat in front of a television. 
[01:27:30]  My entire existence was spent sitting in front of a TV set.  Anthony's the real life cable guy.  Yeah, that's it.  Exactly.  When I saw that and he was just sitting in front of the TV, and I saw him sitting in front  of the TV, I was like, that's how I was raised.  Just sitting in front of a television.  It seems to have panned out.  I mean, but the iPhone, the difference between that and the BlackBerry, I think BlackBerry 
[01:28:00]  is used a lot more in the corporate world.  You always hear, I got to check my BlackBerry.  And the iPhones are a lot more, I don't know, regular people, a little more artistic, I think.  It's fun.  They're fun.  Yeah, fun.  You're right.  Real fun.  Oh, Jesus.  No, it is.  It is fun.  Yikes.  In the middle of the time, just looking online all of a sudden, black screen.  I had that goddamn toy.  I had that You Fly It toy.  Oh, you did? 
[01:28:30]  Iraq just popped up.  There's a bunch of old toy commercials.  Yeah.  And it's one where there's a plane.  Shopper's new action-skilled flying toy that you can fly outdoors or indoors.  I had this.  Fly the scale model plane on a 40-foot glide line and try to land it on a six-foot runway.  You had that?  Yeah, I had it.  Scale model plane, six-foot runway, and 40-foot guideline.  It looked so cool because it had, like, a control panel with a yoke to, you know, steer  the plane with, and all it was is a string that you had to tie to a tree in your yard and 
[01:29:00]  down to the control stick of the plane, and then you hooked the plane on the string, and  you pulled back on the stick, and it released the plane, and then you pushed in on the stick,  and the line got slack in it, and the plane would land.  And it was boring as hell because you couldn't turn it.  It wasn't, you weren't steering it, you weren't flying it, but the commercial made it seem like  you were really flying the plane. 
[01:29:30]  They bamboozled the crap out of us with commercials for toys.  Remember the helicopter that just went around in circles?  The Verde Bird.  That was cool.  The Verde Bird was boring, too, though, and the second it hit something, it was broken.  They had, like, in order to make that turn from the motor, which drove the rotor blades,  because they couldn't put batteries and a motor in the helicopter, so they put it in  that central little rotating unit.  And then the rest of it was this concoction of springs and tubes to get the power to the 
[01:30:00]  rotor blades.  And it wasn't that tough a thing, because the second your rotor blade hit something, it  was no longer connected to the motor, and it was a piece of junk.  Just garbage.  You had the little hook on it?  Yeah, it was a hook, and you had a hook, and then, but you would, again, just fly around  in circles and try to make it hover.  Yeah, hover.  It got boring in two seconds.  It was just horrible games.  And board games.  Anytime someone still brings up a board game that they want to play, there's trouble. 
[01:30:30]  Do we have this, the commercial?  Pop-o-matic, pops the dice, pop a six, and you move twice.  Trouble, trouble, that's the name of Conor's Pop-o-matic game.  Move your men around the track and try to send the others back.  Here comes Sally, look out, Jack, you've got trouble, you've got back.  Sally and Jack.  Uncle Paul.  Trouble, trouble, that's the name of Conor's Pop-o-matic game.  And they showed the whole family playing, like, you watched those commercials and thought 
[01:31:00]  that that's how it was going to be, but your dad was throwing it across the room at your  mom.  Maybe not yours, it was mine.  Like, all my games ended up missing pieces because dad would just heave them against the  wall.  My dad, my dad.  Christmas, and I would think of how nice it was when I got it, like Christmas morning  was so cool, like I'd unwrap Trouble or Mousetrap.  Simon.  Something like that, and Simon was a little after. 
[01:31:30]  Simon says.  If it had batteries, I didn't have it.  Or a ditto machine.  Dittos.  You want dittos?  You like dittos?  You want a ditto?  How about a hat made of dittos?  Dittos?  I hate the word ditto.  And then I owned games that if one piece was missing, it was just, you couldn't play  Mousetrap with a piece missing.  The whole thing was based on, you know, kind of that whole thing, Rube Goldberg machine.  You can't take a piece out of his machine, it's not going to work, or the mouse ain't 
[01:32:00]  going to get trapped.  Rube Goldberg?  Yeah, Rube Goldberg.  Yeah, of course, ditto.  What is that?  It's some gun range for kids with a semi-automatic weapon that shot marbles.  Wow, but it's encased in wood and glass or something.  Plexiglass.  First shot shooting gallery by Marx.  By Marx.  Feel the firepower.  Squeeze off shot after shot with this electric rifle. 
[01:32:30]  And look, press the switch, and you've got a rapid fire submachine gun.  Wow.  It loads itself, too.  And what a wild choice of targets.  You have a Vietnamese.  A Vietnamese.  A Vietnamese.  Rocks the clown.  But he's no pushover.  The automatic scorekeeper shows you how sharp you are.  Or are you?  Try again.  A bullseye.  Take off the revolving ducks.  Watch them go down.  Well, sometime.  Spin the traveler. 
[01:33:00]  What a challenge for everyone.  Eight wild, banging, spinning, bouncing, soaring targets.  Get the electro shot shooting gallery by Marx.  That's the problem with my childhood right there.  Billy Manchington, my second stepdad, who used to beat the crap out of me, but had a lot of money, would buy cool things like that.  And then he'd play with them and break them.  And I'd be done.  They'd always end up broken and just sitting in the basement.  You'd go down in your friend's basement and see cool toys and you're all pissed and jealous that they had all the good toys. 
[01:33:30]  And you didn't have crap or everything that you had was broken.  I had a remote control car, a really nice one, a truck.  And I was so excited.  And he got it.  And he played with it for like an hour and a half Christmas morning.  And touched the antennas and it broke.  Just broke it.  And never, ever replaced it.  Ever.  I never even got a good radio control thing.  I had Doom Buggy wheelies.  And the battery pack controller was connected to the Doom Buggy with a wire. 
[01:34:00]  Yuck.  How far could it go?  So you're chasing it around like a little dog on a leash.  It was horrible.  And then it would break because you'd stand there and let it tug on the wire too hard.  So the wire would rip out.  Then you'd get yelled at.  Say, I buy you a nice stuff and you break it.  Yeah, it's better than you throwing it at mom.  Remember Digger the dog?  A diggin' he goes with you when you explore. 
[01:34:30]  He had to pull his leash and he would like bark, bark, bark.  Digger the dog.  Yeah.  A diggin' he goes with you when you explore.  When you explore.  Remember my buddy?  My buddy.  It was a very funny Hustler cartoon where the doll was bent over the box and it was spelled B-U-T-T-Y.  My buddy?  Hustler magazine had the funniest cartoons ever.  Ever.  Is that Digger the dog? 
[01:35:00]  No, that's a real dog.  I was going to say, wow, what a realistic looking dog that Digger is.  Can you bring up Digger the dog or is it not a bell?  I'm trying to find it.  YouTube and these other video sites, quite amazing for bringing back these nostalgic commercials I remember growing up with.  You remember cigarette commercials?  No.  I don't either.  On TV?  Never.  I remember those.  I remember the tail end of those things and all the little slogans.  I'd rather fight than switch was Tarryton and it showed the person with a black eye smoking to Tarryton. 
[01:35:30]  Because apparently somebody was going around making people switch from Tarryton to another brand and if they didn't switch, they would punch them in the eye.  I guess that was the whole gist of the campaign.  I remember the Schlitz man?  Schlitz was a...  He had the cape.  He was like a superhero.  Oh, no.  I remember Schlitz light.  That was James Coburn. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, it was a cool logo.  He had like a little bandana like you do right now.  Oh, well.  But they covered his eyes and he had a cape.  A little Schlitz man.  I don't remember Schlitz man.  You don't remember Schlitz man?  No.  How about Ballantyne's Ale?  I remember Ballantyne.  I remember Rangold.  Tasted like a foot.  My beer is Rangold, the dry beer.  Think of Rangold whenever you buy beer.  How do you remember that?  Rangold. 
[01:36:30]  Ditto.  I remember full Rangold cans flying by my head.  No, the old man was a Schaefer drinker.  Schaefer?  Schaefer is the one beer to have when you're having more than one.  What was the good drinking beer?  Was that Peels?  And Peels?  Peels?  Oh, well, look at that.  What's that?  I should be having a malt liquor instead of a Schaefer.  What was Peels?  It's a good drinking beer. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Is that Peels?  Is that a beer?  It might be Peels.  I don't remember that one, though.  Is there a Peels commercial?  Can you find it, E-Rock?  P-I-E-L-S, I think.  Because we know how he'll spell it.  P-R-I.  G.I. Joe.  G.I. Joe.  Fighting man from head to toe.  Remember that one?  I remember G.I. Joe, yeah.  I remember the one where you had the guy, and then you wrap the parachute around him, throw 
[01:37:30]  him in the air as hard as you could, and hope the parachute wouldn't deploy.  It would, but if it didn't, it just wound up on the roof.  Or usually it was a streamer.  It would just flutter as the guy did a relative speed of 200 miles an hour if he was actually  that size.  My uncle actually taught me at a certain point how to make bow and arrows out of sticks.  Yeah.  How to make bow and arrows.  I had an uncle that taught me that, too.  Yeah, they take out in the woods.  Yeah.  Well, you'd find a branch that was still green. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  And some twine, and then they'd bend it, and then you'd find sticks and carve the tips  into...  Wow, man, I remember that.  And there you are, shooting arrows.  Yeah.  Parents were very irresponsible back then.  Next thing you know, you're going back, your trousers are buttoned up a little bit wrong.  What happened?  You don't remember a lot except that you're sad, and you have to sleep on your tum-tum.  Something about the uncle hitting the bullseye with his arrow.  Shit. 
[01:38:30]  Every time.  Yeah.  Hot breath on your neck, here's how you shoot the arrow.  Here's a good shot.  God.  Yeah.  I, um...  Yeah, Christmas morning was always so nice, and I get those damn toys, and then just within  days, it was miserable.  God, I had an awful childhood.  Did you ever find a present a couple weeks later that you didn't open?  No.  You never found a, like, a late present?  I was...  We were bad, me and my brother, and since we'd snooped around, found everything, and knew 
[01:39:00]  what we were getting beforehand.  Once I unwrapped my birthday present, like, SubSearch or some horrible game where it was supposed  to be a submarine simulator, but it was way back when, when they couldn't make simulators.  And, uh, I opened it and cut the plastic open with a razor blade and played it and then put  it back and taped it up, thinking mom wasn't gonna see that, but she, uh, she did. 
[01:39:30]  And then she yelled at me.  I'm just like, well, you see, and then I'm trying to rationalize that I enjoy the game  so much that I couldn't wait to play it.  So, good job.  Job well done with getting me that gift.  And then she held it back from me for, like, a week past my birthday as punishment.  It's like, what are parents thinking?  It's like, I just wanted to play with the goddamn thing.  You're taunting me with it.  You're taunting me.  Stupid parents.  I should have just given it to me then. 
[01:40:00]  Here.  Yeah, happy birthday.  I'd make a good parent if I, I'd probably spoil a kid if I didn't hate children so much.  I'd be a great parent if I didn't have such a disdain for children.  You would.  Dad bought me a nice toy.  Where is he?  He's passed out in the living room.  Behind the sofa.  You see Anthony's ankle sticking out from behind the sofa.  Just like a gun on his belly, loaded.  Yeah.  That would be me.  Remember Incredible Edibles? 
[01:40:30]  No.  Yeah, it was, there were some just horrid, dangerous toys.  What about the stuff you used to put on the end of a straw and blow?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Just chemicals?  It was, it was, it was, it was this stuff, it was like rubber.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Super elastic bubble plastic.  Super elastic bubble plastic.  You would pass out if you smelled it too much?  Yeah.  It's called super elastic bubble plastic.  Yeah.  And it would squeeze it out of this toothpaste looking kind of tube and put a ball of it  on the end of a straw and blow into it and it would blow up a big balloon but it was 
[01:41:00]  made of like plastic so if you stopped blowing it would still hold its shape.  You had to twist the straw to seal off the end.  But if you inhaled as you were blowing out to blow the balloon up, the gas in there was  some type of like radon.  Yeah, your eyes would turn black.  It was, it was poisonous.  It was awful.  What did you do with it after you blew it up?  You knocked it around until it popped and went, it popped in like slow motion.  It went, it's like a little Hindenburg just slowly hitting the carpet. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, get out of the way.  Oh, super elastic bubble plastic.  Oh, the humanity.  I remember I found a slingshot at a drugstore.  They used to sell wrist rockets.  They were the aluminum wrist rockets with surgical tubing that was put on these things  and if you, you stretch that thing the entire length of your arm and it was, it would fly  faster than a bullet. 
[01:42:00]  You take a little pebble, gravel from driveway and shoot at somebody.  You literally shot someone just without the gun.  Wrist rocket.  Do you know what's fun?  A good game of Parcheesi between close friends.  Oh, Parcheesi.  But you'd knock your friend back.  Never liked the name Parcheesi.  Yeah, ditto.  It sounded like it smelled.  Hey, I'd like you to meet Parcheesi. 
[01:42:30]  Stretch Armstrong, yeah.  That was another good one.  The trouble with Stretch Armstrong is curiosity.  Always killed Stretch Armstrong because as a kid you just wondered, what the hell's inside  this thing that makes it stretch?  Yet, if I wrap my brother in the head with it, it's like an old blackjack.  It's like an old sap that gangsters used to use.  Those things were hard as rocks when you hit someone with it.  Didn't you want to bite them too?  I would always bite Stretch Armstrong.  You still feel like it.  Yeah, you had to bite him.  You had to bite him. 
[01:43:00]  Just chew his little fat arms and legs.  Bite Stretch his little legs.  Chewed up Stretch Armstrong.  It just felt good to sink your teeth into it.  And then we also had to deal with the likes of Click Clacks, which are very popular for  a while.  It was like the Australian device they used to hunt ostrich with or something.  It was like these two glass balls on strings.  The strings are about a foot or so long with a little ring on the end. 
[01:43:30]  And you would move it up and down, and the balls would go click, click, click, and slowly  get further and further apart.  When they reached midway, you would start clicking it real fast.  They would meet at the top, click real hard, meet at the bottom, and it would be going click,  click, click, click, click in this circular motion.  And then the balls would explode with shrapnel that was akin to that little naked girl running 
[01:44:00]  down the street in Vietnam.  You would, ah!  Covered in blood, things used to go off.  You'd hit your knuckle if you didn't get the balls right?  Yeah, yeah.  You'd smash your knuckles.  Swing around and smash your knuckle or hit a friend in the face.  More teeth were knocked out with those things than any other toy.  There were these molten, molten plastic bugs that they made.  It was like Incredible Edibles.  Incredible Edibles were made out of some kind of, it was deemed edible at the time, plastic. 
[01:44:30]  Edible plastic for the kids.  And you'd make bugs out of them and take the bug out of the mold and then eat it.  And it was plastic.  It was gummy bears.  It was like, it was more like a plastic-y taste to it though.  And it got a little harder than a gummy bear.  But even better than that was just the molding kits for plastic.  It used to make a monster out of it.  So they'd give you these plates that you have to put in this oven and take it out with like 
[01:45:00]  an oven mitt.  And these things would get up to like a thousand degrees.  And if you touched, which you always did, you were a kid.  You didn't know.  It would touch the back of your hand.  I mean, more kids with little mold marks on their hands.  Little friggin' brands that say Mattel on them.  They still got them to this day.  Branded in their hand.  Mattel.  They really didn't give a crap about us as kids.  They'd put toys out and just go, here, have a pisser. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, they'd give you an oven.  Yeah.  Easy, big oven.  Here you go.  Here's an oven.  Cook.  Cook, bitch.  That's what they were just teaching the kids.  Come on.  Cook, bitch.  And then we got the easy-bake bed.  Get in the bedroom when you're done cooking for me.  That's for the easy-bake eye makeup kit.  Yeah.  Get rid of that black eye.  When she got lippy for not baking that cake.  Yeah, I see.  Easy-bake toilet scrubber.  You know, but it's like you complain now.  It's like, I was like, ah, kids suck. 
[01:46:00]  Every toy is like kids safe.  If it's a big, you know, ball that you're supposed to just hold and laugh with.  But then again, the option was, well, here's something you strap onto your arm and shoot  your friends in the throat with.  Here, eat this.  What is it?  We don't know.  It's plastic with some sort of lead paint on top of it.  Yeah.  Enjoy.  It was.  Oh, God.  You know, toys today.  Uh-huh.  Ed on line two.  Ed?  Hey, I actually remember this toy.  And what it was, it was a molten metal car maker. 
[01:46:30]  So you had little kids playing with red-hot metal cars that they would make with, like,  molten solder.  Yeah, that's tin soldiers also.  You used to mold soldiers where you're working in a foundry.  You're working in a metal.  You turned your bedroom into a metal foundry.  Foundry.  And, yeah, you would melt lead.  You would melt lead. 
[01:47:00]  Malted lead was a toy for kids.  And pour it in these molds.  And then hope it was cool when you opened it.  And then they buried any kid that got hurt.  It would just be buried.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that never happened.  Don't worry about it.  We got to take a break, sir.  All right.  We will do one of those.  What's that, Jimmy?  Tell people where you're going to be.  This Friday, I'll be in D.C. at the Falls Church, Virginia, actually, State Theater.  And then next weekend, Los Angeles, December 12th, 13th, the Viper Room.  And can I? 
[01:47:30]  Yes, please.  I know it's two plugs at one time.  It's a taboo.  Is it a taboo?  I don't care.  No, wait.  Look, I'm in D.C.  You're in Florida.  Anyone that gets mixed up deserves to see the wrong show.  I'm going to be in Florida in Marco Island.  It's an island near Fort Myers this Thursday, Friday, Saturday in Sundae.  Go to offthehookcomedyclub.com for tickets.  Very good.  Are you guys on in Florida now? 
[01:48:00]  Oh, you're on XM.  Yeah.  XM.  So all over the place.  All the truck drivers, come on down.  Yeah, you'll get some people down there, I'm sure.  Yeah.  And we'll return after these words.  We'll be back tomorrow with us.  Allegedly.  Allegedly.  What was he, stuck in Florida or something?  I don't know. 
[01:48:30]  Um, yeah.  And his lovely new bride.  Yeah, they're having a big flight delay.  Did anybody cry?  Did anybody cry at the wedding?  Uh, who, Iraq?  Did Iraq cry?  Because his hero, his number one hero is getting there.  You cried, Eric?  Look at the look of just disdain.  Why'd you cry?  That he was giving stunt brain.  He cried because he wanted to be the one to marry over.  Ah!  Were you jealous of Lindsay's dress and everything?  I should have been in that dress next to Ovi.  Were you and your girl talking about when your big day is going to be? 
[01:49:00]  Uh, yeah.  Microphone, Eric.  We haven't settled on the date, but it'll probably just be a Monday.  We walk in and it's done.  Haven't settled on a date?  How long have you been engaged?  Over a year.  That's just silly.  You gotta do it quick so it ends up a disaster.  She's a beautiful girl.  Get it done.  Get it done.  I am.  You gotta propose within three months of the beginning of the relationship so it completely  falls apart very quickly and costs you a lot of money.  I saw a fan on Nathaniel, our old... 
[01:49:30]  Did you?  Yeah, he's now married.  I played him online yesterday.  He's fantastic at the game, by the way.  I know.  He, uh, really bugs me.  He has the personality of a mushroom.  That's why he's very good at the game.  Hey, Bob.  How are you?  Yeah.  Somebody behind you, Bob.  Yeah.  Look out, Bob.  I'll get him and the 30 other guys that are charging over the hill.  I got it.  Is he good?  He's good.  Yeah, he's good.  He's really good.  Yeah.  He's really good.  He's cool.  Bastard.  Yeah, that and a buck will get you riding the subway.  It's actually two bucks. 
[01:50:00]  That's what they say.  It's two bucks.  Can somebody, uh, by the way, can somebody, can Deepak Chopra just shut his stupid mouth?  What is he saying?  The hug doctor?  He's such a douche, this guy.  He's a monumental douche.  Just talking about how, uh, the, the, the, the, the Islamic, uh, terrorist acts in India  from the Pakistani radicals somehow are the fault of the U.S. 
[01:50:30]  And all goes back to U.S. policy.  Oh, of course.  He's just, this guy's such a scumbag.  Of course it is.  Why wouldn't it be?  Well, they actually found out, they, they, the U.S. warned India a month ago that it was  going to happen.  Did they?  Yeah, they said they knew it was going to happen.  They were going to come from water, uh, the sea, and they, they were, uh, Pakistanis,  and it was going to happen.  They warned them.  They did nothing.  But India and Pakistan have hated each other and had so much trouble over there.  Was it Kashmir?  That's stupid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And how do you blame that on us?  Stupid Zeppelin song.  They love the fabric. 
[01:51:00]  No, I don't think that's it.  I think it's a town.  Oh.  Oh.  Is it a town?  Oh.  A little town.  But yeah, he was, uh, I don't, Larry King, of course, didn't call him out on it.  That's stupid irrelevant.  Why not, why wouldn't you call someone out on that and go, how?  Please explain to me how.  Because Larry doesn't know.  It's the United States' fault.  It's our fault.  Well, Obama president now, nothing's going to be our fault.  Believe me.  Nothing.  Well, he's saying that, like, U.S. policy would make these moderates radical.  Like, basically saying that it's out, instead of just blaming Islam for the, like, nobody 
[01:51:30]  ever tries to find the root cause of 15th century Christianity.  They're always looking for these excuses for Islamic radicals.  Yeah.  Like, no one says, hey, well, the Christians in the 15th century, here's the root cause.  They were just barbarians.  And that was it.  Yeah.  But people won't say that about Islam because they're afraid of them.  So irritating.  Well, they do have quite the way of, uh, getting revenge on people.  Yeah.  They really do.  I mean, uh, they, they know exactly what, what to do.  Swop your head off.  They chop your head off.  Blow you up. 
[01:52:00]  Well, if you print a cartoon they don't like, they'll threaten your life.  Lovely.  Lovely.  It's a peaceful, uh, religion, though, is what I hear.  Oh, Hannity, apparently, thanks to you.  Hannity got into him.  Good.  You know, all these dummies that hate Sean Hannity, I'm so glad he, he, uh, got into  it with, uh, Stupid Chopper.  Did he smash him?  Oh, he did.  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah, yeah, he got into it.  He got into it.  It's a long clip, that's all.  How long of a clip is it?  I can't see.  Can we cut it down?  Yeah, it's 30, 40 seconds.  That's too long.  Can we cut it down in, like, four seconds? 
[01:52:30]  Cut three minutes and 38 seconds out of it and bring it back quick.  Definitely want to, uh, just, I want to hear him slam him.  You hear the basic point this dope, uh, uh, throws out and then hear Hannity just slam  him.  Yeah, Chopper just, I hate his stupid face and I hate his goody two-shoes philosophy and  I hate all these Hollywood fruits that just can't get enough of him.  Do you hear what he said?  No, I didn't.  It's so, uh, in, it's so in for, for Hollywood, uh, ass wipes to, um, to really align themselves 
[01:53:00]  with these radicals.  It's, it's, they feel like it's, um, it gives them some kind of credibility to, uh, you know,  bash the U.S. and say that, yeah, these people are right.  Because they feel safe bashing the U.S., because they know it's okay to bash the U.S.  It's, it's like yelling about mommy and daddy.  Instead of, like, there was some phony Indian director, I think he's from Wisconsin, at  the Indian Film Festival, which was going on when this attack happened, and he's on the 
[01:53:30]  red carpet wearing the, the ever dangerous George Bush picture, international terrorist,  you know, that hack, corny sentiment, while right down the road, Pakistani, uh, Islamic  fundamentalists are, are murdering hotel guests.  Yeah, yeah.  Like that.  You want to be dangerous, you little scumbag?  Why don't you wear a picture of an Islamic terrorist?  You know, where, where's Zawahari, uh, Zawahari, however you say his stupid name, wear his face  on your shirt and stand on the red carpet.  You won't be able to see what's on the shirt when it's covered in your blood that's pumping 
[01:54:00]  out of your neck.  No, none of them.  That's the problem.  It's always, they always try to excuse, uh, radical Islam, because if they excuse them, then  maybe Islam, if I'm nice to them, maybe they won't cut my head off.  I mean, that's the basic fear.  Yeah.  Uh, uh, stupid, uh, the, the being nice, uh, thing, it doesn't, doesn't seem to work  with them.  No.  People don't understand the hatred that they have for the West.  They just hate the way of life.  They, they look at us as very decadent and, uh, evil. 
[01:54:30]  But they also don't respect, uh, people who are nice.  If, if you fight back, they respect that more.  If you don't, then they don't respect you at all.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're psychos.  I mean, they're all brought up in war.  The kids have guns.  It's their whole lifestyle.  It's not like, yeah, they are like taught very young.  Yeah.  We suck.  They know war.  They've known war their whole lives.  You can't just crack them out of it.  You know, here's a, here's a, uh, Xbox.  Go relax for a little bit.  But every time some excuse is given, well, you know, that type of radical thinking is 
[01:55:00]  made out of poverty.  Well, what about Bin Laden's billionaire?  And number two, uh, uh, Zawahari's a surgeon from Egypt and all these, uh, 9-11 hijackers  were bright guys.  They weren't poor.  Yeah.  They were living good lives.  Oh, well, then they just change it.  Well, that's because of U.S. foreign policy.  They always find a reason to take the onus off of the fact that they're just radical  religious people who are acting out of, uh, uh, religious zeal.  And that's it.  Well, what happens when, uh, Obama's in there and, uh, you know, Hillary's secretary of 
[01:55:30]  state and you got a lot of liberals running things.  Shouldn't that make the situation better?  I mean, if you're wearing a t-shirt that says, uh, you know, George Bush international  terrorist, if you're an international terrorist, um, don't, aren't you pretty much that for  a while?  You don't, you don't lose your job as international terrorist.  The guy's going to be out of office in no time.  All right.  Uh, you know, I, I think Bush bashing at this point now is, uh, moot. 
[01:56:00]  It's safe.  It's, it's, it's like, there's no reason he's out of work.  He's nothing right now.  He's just, he's going to be, uh, uh, unemployed and, uh, sitting at home.  So why, why even bother?  Yeah.  Whether you hate him or not, you know, or love him, whatever it is, a truth be told, he's  just going to be done.  And Obama's going to be president.  And then, then what?  Then where's the excuse going to be? 
[01:56:30]  Where's the, who's, who's going to be the scapegoat?  The escape go.  Oh, nobody blamed Clinton when they tried to attack the trade center in, what was it?  Uh, 92, 92 or 93, whatever it was.  I mean, that wasn't seen as well.  That was a, I mean, that was on his watch, right?  Yeah.  I mean, that wasn't seen as a Bill Clinton's fault.  Uh, but it seems like whenever, whenever the terrorists did in Bush's watch was his  fault.  Not that Bush is not a retard, cause he is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Irritating guys like Shope.  He's just a coward.  And I'm not that I'm brave and I want to fight terrorists without a weapon, but it's like, 
[01:57:00]  it's like this, Hey, look, I'll bend over and grab my ankles.  Just don't hurt me.  Instead of just being truthful.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Stop blaming everybody, but them.  They got, they have everybody scared.  Crapless is what it is.  Everyone's petrified of, uh, the Muslims with, and, and, and that's their, that's been their  goal.  Except for Israel.  Yeah.  They're just dying to, uh, to wipe them all off the face of the planet. 
[01:57:30]  Well, it's like, it's like the phony New York times and all these other little sissy  newspapers.  I don't get that one.  I get the regular one.  What's that?  Where's the phony New York times sold?  The phony, it actually, they spell it funny.  They spell it, uh, uh, uh, F O N dash E.  So you're like, all right, it's kind of ironic.  Um, boy, was I, was I fledgling there.  Um, but like how they'll like, they won't show that, that the, the Danish cartoon where  they depicted Muhammad and there was death threats and yet any other religion that that 
[01:58:00]  was a cartoon about that where there was an attack, they would have showed it because  it was new.  They would show any, uh, icon, all of a sudden now they have reverence for someone's  religion or maybe they were afraid that they would be.  They were bombed by Muslims and they don't want to come out and go, well, we kowtow to  Muslims because we're scared of them.  This is what pussies we've been acting like for a long time.  It was so aggravating.  Yeah.  But I mean, geez, I mean, I, I mean, I, yeah, yeah, you can say that, but I mean, I don't  want to get bombed.  No one does.  But just admit that.  I don't want a fatwa on me.  But just admit that. 
[01:58:30]  At least if they came out and admitted that.  That would have been a perfect fat joke around six months ago, right?  Oh, fatwa.  I've seen your eyes just rolling in the back of your head like that.  Bob Kelly saying fatwa.  Oh, sorry.  They don't come out and say that they act like they're being impartial.  If they came out and said, look, there's too many Islamic extremists, they bomb people  and they kill you if you don't agree with them.  Or if you say what they find objectionable, they kill you.  Yeah.  But they won't say that because that's a politically incorrect thing.  That's an unpopular thing to say.  Right.  They won't come out and say that. 
[01:59:00]  But so many people are petrified of them.  And they're very, especially the militant radicals, the way they live, the way they take out their  retribution on people is very primitive.  It seems to me they'd be easily defeated with a little teamwork.  But the thing is, it's that goddamn, I hate to say it, but that oil, geez, you can't just run in there  and start wiping these people out because they run the essence of our energy, which really sucks. 
[01:59:30]  That's why I like Barack Obama.  I like the fact that there's going to be a big, we have to take a hit.  I like the fact there's going to be some alternative energy exploration.  I'm not sure where he's going to pull that out of.  It doesn't matter as long as we're not dependent on these scumbag countries anymore.  I'm tired of depending on these people.  I'm sick of it.  I'm sick of being involved with them.  I know.  To not have to deal with them would be fantastic.  Do you think we honestly like the Saudis? 
[02:00:00]  Do you think we honestly enjoy the way they are?  Why don't we call them out on their civil rights violations of their people and their women  that are treated like dogs?  Because we have to be buddies with them.  Yeah, but why do we care?  I mean, we didn't care for hundreds of years.  We didn't care.  Just do whatever you do.  We go there.  We constantly call out people on these.  Now we care about everybody, what everybody's doing around the world. 
[02:00:30]  No, that's just it.  We embrace China because they own most of our money and most of our real estate.  But their civil rights violations against their own people are horrific.  They are terrible when it comes to how they treat their own people.  But we turn a blind eye to that one.  It's just one of those things where certain people were like,  hey, hey, we don't like the way you're treating your people.  Like Iraq, like Saddam. 
[02:01:00]  We turned it into a, hey, the way he treats his people is terrible.  We've got to go in there and liberate them.  Go scratch your ass.  We don't care about them.  No one cares about the Iraqi people.  It's like we don't care about the Chinese people.  Do we care if China's government is torturing their own people?  No, we don't.  We honestly know it's just the way humanity is.  We would care if it was here.  But, you know, that's how that's how we are.  It's just selective. 
[02:01:30]  Whenever we need to stick our stupid faces in somewhere, we have to find an excuse to do it.  There's always a self-interest in it, though.  It's never this high and mighty morality that we have.  Well, that's the reason we do it.  It's an interest, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  We have to, you know, we have to keep the lights on.  You know, it's not necessarily a bad thing.  But don't try to, you know, BS everybody and say it's this morality issue.  We just mind our business.  Yes. 
[02:02:00]  Pull our troops out of Germany.  We don't need them in Germany.  We don't need them in Korea.  Korea, all that money wasted protecting us out.  Blech.  Why?  Europe's one big happy family that can't stand us anymore now that they're the European Union.  They're all together.  And they, you know, they think we suck.  So screw you.  Pull all our troops out of there.  They were there to protect them against the Soviets anyway.  They've been gone for years.  And then, yeah, Korea is another thing.  The only place we need them is Japan.  Because we're their military. 
[02:02:30]  Too bad.  No, we are.  They can't have a military ever since we dropped the bomb.  They should have a military if they.  They want one.  I don't know if I just dropped an F-bomb.  I'm not sure if I did it.  That's close.  How about this?  If they pipe up again, they get the same hot hat we gave them a few years ago.  I mean, you've got to mind if that's not a lesson taught.  What, you want to do what?  Do you not remember?  Yeah.  Stop building that.  We need a whole new infrastructure.  Why do you.  Go ahead, let us level it for you.  Why do you think your grandmother has no hair?  Yeah, we've got to take a little break. 
[02:03:00]  And we're going to head over to SiriusXM right now and do our satellite show.  Yes.  We'll use filthy language.  We'll talk about horrible things.  We'll do jokes about retarded people.  We'll treat women horribly.  It'll just be a fun, fun day.  We should have women on the show more.  We should.  It's very homoerotic.  A bunch of men just looking at each other as men.  We don't have girls on.  Yeah, I know.  And we do.  We're mean to them.  We're dumb. 
[02:03:30]  We are stupid.  We're dumb.  We need girls.  Girls, we want to welcome girls over to the studio.  All we do is sit there and pick them apart.  Yeah.  It's annoying.  We're very mean to the girls.  What are you, Moe's?  Why don't we just roll around naked, a bunch of us?  Don't worry about fat chicks.  Yeah, no, no, no.  You fat pigs.  Stay home.  Yeah, stay home.  I don't even want your friendship.  All right, we'll be back.  We'll be back in a few minutes. 
[02:04:00]  Are we done?  Please don't go anywhere.  And we're done here.  Oh, all right.  But then we'll take a little stroll.  All right.  Okay?  And see you in a couple of minutes.  Opie and Anthony program, phase two.  All right.  The filthy segment.  No, I tease, of course.  We use very clever tactics here to cover up curse words and, you know, basic ideas of 
[02:04:30]  sex and violence.  Yeah, sure we do.  Hi.  Laszlo's here, which is great.  Yeah, big deal.  What?  Wow.  Laszlo.  You know what I noticed about Bobby the other day?  Have you noticed that Bobby Kelly's here?  Before you snap on me, why don't you deal with Jim?  Okay.  Anytime you come in here, you get smashed on and you go right to me. 
[02:05:00]  Go ahead.  Right.  I didn't smash, Laszlo.  Right.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Laszlo.  Smashing?  No, I didn't smash.  Bobby has no idea of personal space.  Have you ever noticed when you're standing talking to him, he's about three inches from  your nose?  He fucking did that to me before at CBS.  You creep.  What are you, blind?  He comes right over and he's like lip to lip.  I had to sit down.  This is a guy telling me this who, you know, before we came back from break, had my hand  and took it and held it on his crotch.  Here's what me and Kenny were doing.  Kenny had his hand on Bob's shoulder, so I took Bob's hand and I just pressed it against 
[02:05:30]  my dick and he's like going to try to outlast me.  And I'm like, I'll stay in here all weekend, kiddo.  You cannot outgay, Jimmy.  Because that's the joke is to not move your hand and be like, all right, you think you're  going to get me?  And then Jimmy will...  Fucking, I hate his five o'clock shadow.  Steve's nuzzling.  Five o'clock shadow.  Steve's nuzzling Bobby and he doesn't like it.  I just don't like the whiskers.  Yeah, no one does.  I get all upset that we call him gay later.  Because he's nuzzling people.  So yeah, you have to give him a good point, Laszlo. 
[02:06:00]  He did that to me at the Halloween party backstage.  I thought he was going to try to kiss me.  I mean, he was that close.  Why wouldn't I try to kiss you?  I don't know.  Look at you.  He's already kissed Sam.  Really?  Yeah.  He totally kissed Sam.  Don't fuck around with the Sam thing, all right?  That's a serious thing.  I don't want to talk about it.  Dude, we are five minutes into this shit and it's gay.com.  It's already gotten gay, gay, gay, more gay.  Do we have some women?  I would like to hear from some fucking women.  I'm tired of this show being so stupid with chicks. 
[02:06:30]  We're like a bunch of faggots.  Why are there no girls in here?  I have no idea.  God almighty.  I'm not saying all the time.  I could half answer that.  All right.  Because all the things that we want to do with girls in here get shot down by the quote lawyers.  But I'm saying even when we do have them in, like, why do we have to have them shoving  tomatoes in their cunt?  Can't we do anything with a girl where her tits are just out?  Jesus Christ. 
[02:07:00]  Just tits, right?  Are we that out of touch with fucking other guys that we forget guys like tits and pussy?  They don't need a bowling ball rolled into their uterus to be entertaining.  That's pretty funny.  How come we laugh, though, when you say it?  Because it's a wonderful idea.  That never happens.  If those cunt pieces would let us.  Exactly.  We need, like, I'm thinking of the old NEW days and how we used to get girls in there  to do certain things.  And it was, it worked.  I don't know why now it's different. 
[02:07:30]  Because we're stupid.  Like, we had Dennis from the Bunny Ranch in with Air Force Amy.  Yeah.  But we had David who was going to go to the fucking Bunny Ranch.  David?  And he's willing to get David laid.  And David was like, oh, okay, I'll go.  And we just drop it.  Yeah.  We're fucking stupid.  Why didn't he end up going?  Because we're stupid.  Lawyers.  What?  We could have just sent him.  Yeah, we could have just sent him.  Why are you asking the lawyers in the first place?  Exactly.  Just send him. 
[02:08:00]  Send him out with a video camera.  Just send him.  It's his own fucking trip.  It's better to apologize than ask permission.  Exactly.  You don't go to your chick and say, can I fuck some other chick tonight?  No.  You come home and say, I fucked another chick tonight.  Deal.  You let him find him in the closet.  Right.  Absolutely.  You say, smell my dick.  Guess who?  That's a game and she feels like she's obligated to guess.  Yes.  Um.  Betty?  Bob Kelly?  See, it meant you got fucked.  He's so in love with his goddamn iPhone. 
[02:08:30]  He is really in love with his iPhone.  Dude, I know, but I'm keeping in touch with the fans, Laszlo.  I love my iPhone, too.  Relax.  I love my iPhone, too.  Jimmy hates it.  It's a piece of shit.  I love my iPhone.  I love it.  It's not.  It's garbage.  I'm online right now.  Let's see when it kicks me off.  Actually, Jim, you'll enjoy this.  I think it was in England.  They banned one of the iPhone commercials that was running because they show that little  finger doing everything and everything's going really fast.  It's like, oh, watch what you could do with Google Maps. 
[02:09:00]  Bam.  There it is.  Oh, let me take this call.  Oh, let me, you know, go look something up on the web.  And it's just bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  When in reality, obviously.  Well, they don't have like all the time to do in the commercial.  So they kind of speed it up.  They lie.  But it's not.  Well, it's not that slow.  Well, there's a side by side comparison.  And it's kind of funny because they have, you know, they show that they play the commercial  on this YouTube video and then have a guy doing all the things in the commercial.  And the commercial is over, you know, 45 times before it's done, before the iPhone. 
[02:09:30]  But it is.  Oh, sorry, Dan.  Kicked offline.  I was online.  I don't get kicked offline.  Because the iPhone is a piece of fucking shit.  I don't, I've got full bars.  God, could we have used that at the church?  I do too.  But I was just online and Safari, which is fucking horrible, just kicked me off again.  And it's happened with every iPhone I've had.  I'm on Safari right now.  Well, you can't run certain apps. 
[02:10:00]  Well, how about that fucking turtleneck wearing bucket of jizz?  Fucking Steve Jobs says that the next time he is sticking a big dick in everybody's mouth.  I just checked in for my continental flight on the iPhone.  Fantastic.  Great.  Excellent.  All right.  Excellent.  I'm on Safari.  Certain things work very, very well.  Yeah.  You know what doesn't?  The fucking phone and the internet.  But you want to play Scrabble?  Oh, Scrabble away, folks. 
[02:10:30]  A four-letter word for iPhone.  Do you have an S?  I have an H and I and a T.  Fucking garbage.  And I'm not going to shut down Apple.  But I'm telling you, you know how many emails I've gotten from people saying,  Dude, you convinced me to not buy an iPhone.  Really?  Good.  A lot of people.  But.  A lot of people.  I have one.  And I've been through it.  People have listened to me for a year complaining about this fucking thing.  And I hear the new Verizon Blackberry's a hunk of shit, too.  I fucking hate everyone.  I just got on IMDb.  I've never been kicked on. 
[02:11:00]  That's what I am.  You should turn off the Wi-Fi.  Why should you have to, when they have it as a feature, to connect faster to the Internet?  Why should the Wi-Fi kick me off?  Here is the reason that you're having trouble with your iPhone.  Yeah, because it's a piece of shit.  No.  It's user error.  Oh.  Here's the deal.  Wi-Fi is basically people that set up antennas to their personal Internet connection, right?  So, let's say here in the office, if you want wireless Internet, they'll set up a Wi-Fi antenna.  Most people have those locked down so that you can't just connect to it. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Or, for instance, at my house, my phone can connect to my Wi-Fi, to my wireless, but other people's phone can't just connect to it.  Right.  Right?  Because it's all...  Because you have the password.  Correct.  Correct.  So, if you're in an area where you know that you can connect to a Wi-Fi hotspot, like if you're at a Starbucks or something like that, then absolutely use it.  Which is what I'm doing right now, because I'm on the XM server.  And I'm on Wi-Fi because I have the password, so I'm connected the way I would be at home. 
[02:12:00]  You see, it's not...  I understand what you're saying, that a lot of times Wi-Fi doesn't work because you don't have passwords or it's locked.  Right.  Or you're not near a signal.  Not the case here.  We have a fucking signal.  This is the XO.  XM has Wi-Fi in here.  Yeah, they do.  And I was kicked off because this is a piece of fucking cock.  And even my manager, Jonathan's a big Apple guy, and he hates his iPhone now.  He hates it.  I don't understand it.  I'm telling you, I've had a problem with every phone.  Every fucking iPhone I've had. 
[02:12:30]  Name a piece of technology that you've had a good experience with.  Exactly.  Most technologies.  I know how to press the fucking iPhone and work it.  Okay, here's something.  How's this my fault?  Send me a fucking picture of my iPhone.  Not with your iPhone, of course, because you can't do that.  But send me a picture.  Go to ViewMyMessage.com.  And try that from your phone.  Try getting a ViewMyMessage.com from your phone.  You can't do it. 
[02:13:00]  Server, stop responding.  What the fuck does that mean?  That does suck.  What does that mean?  I hate that thing.  That does suck.  Why?  Everybody who loves the iPhone, somebody explain to me, why does that fucking happen?  Why?  I don't have a clue.  Lazlo, do you understand?  But there hasn't been...  But it does happen, right?  I don't even...  But I've never owned a phone that I've liked 100%.  And that's something on the iPhone that I think sucks.  I've never had a problem with being kicked offline like you are. 
[02:13:30]  I don't know why.  And I find all these apps fascinating.  How many times, Ant, or anybody, have you gotten the photo for your iPhone,  and you go to ViewMyMessage.com on your home computer,  because that's the way we all do it.  Oh, and look at a two-inch picture.  The two-inch picture, more piece of shit AT&T raping.  But the fact that it won't, it won't, it keeps giving you an error message.  Yeah, yeah.  It will not open the fucking page.  I hate that.  So, there's another problem with it.  You do what they say to do, and it doesn't work. 
[02:14:00]  AT&T stinks.  They think, like, what do they think, Manhattan falls off after Broadway West?  You fucking cocks, I live here.  And I can't get reception in my home.  I had to buy a Verizon BlackBerry for emergencies.  Like, for reception.  That's what shit AT&T is.  How about a normal phone that plugs into the wall?  I have one of those, too.  Those things.  I would never use a cell phone full-time.  But, I mean, just to have my, uh...  But, Jim, look what you could do.  Oh, that's cool. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, you could play the drums.  Excellent.  Danny's playing the drums on his iPhone.  I'm playing poker right now.  Is that neat?  Cool.  I'm doing everything except making an accurate phone call and sending and receiving a picture  and getting online, which is all I want this fucking hunk of cock for.  I won $35 in one day on lemonade stands for Samsung.  That's great.  You'll spend that in fucking dropped calls.  And it's business lost.  Because your phone is sitting in front of you, and it rang, and you didn't hear it ring.  Why?  Because AT&T is great if you're sitting in the AT&T building. 
[02:15:00]  That's cool.  Danny's playing guitar.  Fucking amazing.  The iPhone, wonderful if you're in a band.  What are you doing?  Terrible if you're stranded on the side of the road.  Wow, sound effects.  Look at all the things you can do.  Fucking amazing.  Bobby, when does that ever come in handy?  When are you, like, in a social situation other than on the radio?  I'll tell you, when you can't make a call and you're lonely.  Hey, let me hear some sounds.  That car crash could have come in handy.  Coming in handy right now, Laszlo. 
[02:15:30]  Ha ha ha.  Wow.  Wow.  See, you got your own sound effect machine.  I have to, uh, I can push my own buttons on this show.  Anthony, I brought you a phone, but.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Here it is.  Speaking of computers, it's Grand Theft Auto 4 for PC.  For the PC, which is, uh, this is what I.  Stupid keyboard, mouse.  I saw a really cool trailer, I think, that Rockstar released last week. 
[02:16:00]  There's a whole in-depth, like, video editor mode where you could just, you know, like,  if you're killing people or go on a huge, you know, killing spree, then you could kind  of, you could take what happened from different angles and edit your own video.  Am I right about that?  Yeah, it's the replay editor.  So, basically, it's always recording.  Right.  And you can, you know, hit the button and grab, like, the last 30 seconds worth of footage.  If something real cool happens, yeah.  People are, you know, people will be able to make their own trailers, their own commercials.  We made a bunch of spoof commercials and put it up at rockstargames.com, like spoof trailers 
[02:16:30]  and just sort of funny videos.  One's called Burgatory that's pretty funny.  Wow.  Where a guy's trapped in the burger shot restaurant in the game, and he keeps running out the front  door, and when he runs out the front door, he sees himself running back inside.  And he can't get out.  That's fucked up.  It's pretty funny stuff.  But, yeah, like, the replay editor should be pretty huge.  Oh, I'm so psyched.  There's also a new radio station in there where you can take, you can point it. 
[02:17:00]  Can we get a job at it?  Shit.  You can point Grand Theft Auto 4 to your MP3 collection, and so it'll pull songs from  your MP3 collection, but there's also a DJ in commercials.  Holy shit.  Yeah, it's your own radio station.  And, of course, the DJ talks about what shit music you've got, and you probably didn't  even pay for it.  That's good.  Oh, look at this guy.  Seems to have a desert eagle on the back.  Yes.  Yes.  I was just having a little fun with mine yesterday at the range. 
[02:17:30]  Me and Keith were at the range.  I thought you were supposed to take it easy.  Our desert eagle.  You're going to blow all the follicles out of your head.  No, I was only for five days, and I'm past the five-day mark, so now I'm drinking and  shooting again.  So, let me get this, because I walked in here, and you're wearing a bandana like you're.  Yeah, I got my bandana on.  Like you're in a gang.  Yeah, yeah.  So, did you shoot the gun upside down at the range?  I shot it sideways.  I shot that thing sideways, yo.  Yeah, like a crit.  No, I wear the bandana because I don't want to walk around looking ridiculous because, 
[02:18:00]  you know, the back of my head has little nubbles on it, and the rest of it has kind of long  hair, and the front is a little rashy where the hair is growing in.  So, you know, I got to wear something for a while.  I tried the hat yesterday, but it was killing me.  It was like hurting the stitches on the back of my neck, and I didn't have any Percocet with  me.  That's all at home. 
[02:18:30]  I have something to look forward to when I get home.  Oh, that Percocet.  Can you tighten it up a little bit?  Do you have to look like a slave?  No, I like it all loose like that.  So, it doesn't hurt his head.  By the way, kicked offline again while I was talking.  Kicked offline again.  Again.  I guess I did something wrong.  I opened Safari.  But go ahead.  I just want you to know.  You have to try a sixth phone.  No, I don't.  Sixth is a charm.  Is it always the same sites that are crashing on you?  Yeah, AOL, MySpace.  Why don't you just get that MySpace app?  Yeah, get the app.  It doesn't matter.  Even if I don't have it, why should I have to, oh, I should get the app so it doesn't 
[02:19:00]  kick me offline everywhere I am.  What's this?  The app?  This is the I Don't Suck fucking app?  Could you get that one?  Anyone out there who's going to buy a phone, there's a lot of people listening, go out and  buy an iPhone.  Go spend your money on this fucking thing.  Get rid of the service you have and deal with this fucking shit.  Jim, I think tens of millions of people have already.  Dude, absolutely. 
[02:19:30]  It's the biggest phone in the world.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  A-P-P.  Yes.  Absolutely.  LOL.  Don't put this app on.  Well, shut your phone down.  Do they allow for other browser support?  I'm not even sure if you can get something besides Safari.  Safari State.  I haven't seen that.  Maybe if you jailbreak it.  Because what's the difference between that and Microsoft's antitrust case for packaging  Internet Explorer with Windows?  It's the same thing.  They're putting their own browser with their own...  I would rather have Explorer.  Well, iPhone's argument was, we suck even with our own one. 
[02:20:00]  So, how do you think we'll do with yours?  That was their argument in court.  Because at least if you had the option to try another browser, that would be nice.  And Steve Jobs actually showed up and he went...  With his little light Fiona Apple fingers.  He's scrolling through things.  He's scrolling.  You could scroll through your pictures.  You could just kind of wipe your finger on the screen and go...  Yeah, and then it gets stuck.  And you go, why did it stop moving?  Why is it jammed?  It's a paper jamming.  Why is it jammed?  It's jamming.  You understand, we're in the early days of the technology revolution here. 
[02:20:30]  I understand that.  The combustion engine has just been invented.  Jimmy wants it now.  What I want is what I'm promised.  And what I know they could do.  It's like, I understand there's going to be problems.  But when they fucking tout this thing like it's the most amazing piece of technology.  And they purposefully make it so you can't send photos, they're fucking scumbags.  That does bug me, the photo part.  They're purposefully made that way.  I've been texted photos. 
[02:21:00]  It's shit.  And you sit there and go, well, that's something I can't look at.  Why?  Why would they do that?  Why would they do that?  Why would they neglect to give you a cut and paste after a year and a half?  Why can't I download my notes?  How about video on the camera?  Flash, can't get flash.  Why is there three megapixels where they can have fucking nine megapixels?  Because they're all scumbags.  You have to brutalize them.  Because it's not a technological problem.  It's that they're fucking scumbags.  I mean, Apple's known for this.  And I'm sure they'll do it once again with the next gen iPhone. 
[02:21:30]  It's on purpose because it's pre-planned obsolescence.  They will add all of those features that you want in the iPhone that comes out in 2011.  So that you have to buy another one.  And the old one sits in your drawer.  Or you throw it in with the rest of the phones.  I have a drawer full of cell phones.  And it's like nostalgia.  I open it up and go, oh, I remember this one.  And you look at it and go, oh, I remember calling this person on this.  They get the new phone out that actually has the flexible screen on it. 
[02:22:00]  That actually folds open.  It's a flexible screen.  Who doesn't?  It opens up like this.  And it comes out like that.  And the whole thing is screen.  Or you can close it up and use it just as a regular phone.  Really?  Yeah.  What service?  Do you know what brand?  I think it's a prototype.  Oh, okay.  We'll never see it.  But it's done.  No, those are coming out soon.  Bobby's talking about it like it's a concept car that he saw at the auto show.  Oh, yeah.  It's coming out.  Oh, yeah.  That's coming out.  It's got wings on it and fins.  They'll be coming out very soon. 
[02:22:30]  Listen, dude, I've been to a billion tech conventions and I can tell you that shit ain't fucking  coming out.  That shit never comes out.  They've been talking about the flexible screen.  They've been talking about the home video phone.  They actually have.  Sony actually has a flexible screen and TVs.  Monitor paint.  How about monitor paint?  Comes in a can.  You just paint your wall and it's a monitor.  What the fuck?  All the electronics are in the paint.  Are you out of your fucking mind?  Why?  You're talking about some fucking silly screen?  Why do you need a flexible? 
[02:23:00]  Why do you need a paint monitor?  You can YouTube what the fuck I'm saying.  Yours is fucking from your Oxycontin, whatever you're taking.  You can YouTube monitor paint.  No, you can't.  Sure, something will come up.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah, look.  Go ahead, Danny.  YouTube monitor paint.  And it'll be some idiot painting his monitor.  And then there'll be somebody.  Here you go.  There's monitor paint?  Yeah.  What is it?  There's somebody.  Oh, somebody's painting their monitor.  There's somebody's spray-painting their computer monitor. 
[02:23:30]  Okay.  I thought it was monitor paint where you just paint it on your wall and make a monitor.  But explain how this works, Anthony.  You're walking around your palatial estate and you're like, wow, I could really use a TV  right there.  Yeah.  Then you just take the roller out, roll it in some monitor paint, and then you paint it  on the wall and turn it on.  Yeah, like a Roadrunner cartoon.  Yes, yes.  Where you used to paint like a tunnel so the Roadrunner would crash into it, but the Roadrunner  went through the tunnel.  And then Coyote crashed into it.  You are fucking percoceted out of your space, dude. 
[02:24:00]  I wish I was.  Sounds fucking great, though.  I want one.  Nice can.  You could do girl paint.  Just paint a chick on the wall and fuck it.  All right.  What is that?  Flexible screens.  I already got them.  Oh, is that the flexible screen?  Yep.  Sony.  That thing stinks.  It's like cellophane.  What do you need it for?  So you can put it in your back pocket?  Because what will happen is that they actually have it in Germany now.  It's a cell phone.  It's like this big.  And you, instead of...  You put it in a chicken's ass and fuck it. 
[02:24:30]  Germans.  You actually, you pull it out, the screen, and it becomes this big.  And it's all touchscreen, and then you push it back in, and it's a little small thing.  That is just like a strip of shit.  Oh, yeah.  It's like cellophane.  Yeah.  And it's got, I don't know, it's got some electronics on there.  Yeah.  That TV's going to be that thing.  And there's going to be no more newspapers.  It's going to be just a little piece of paper.  Dude, I've, listen, I've heard that for so many years.  Your newspapers are obsolete.  We're all going to walk around with electronic paper.  Yeah.  And it's just going to download two and every... 
[02:25:00]  Fuck bullshit.  He's right, though.  Bobby's right.  It's the same asshole that said, yeah, they're going to have fucking cell phones.  Fuck that.  Flying cars.  Are you a moron?  I went to the moon, you idiot.  I think Bob is right, though.  Are you a fucking moron, really?  No, he's not.  He's really smart, actually.  But I disagree.  I expect moron to realize on this, because I think there's simply, like, when you look  at the fact that, like, a blockbuster, all these places are closing down because  of online downloads, simply there's going to be no market for newspapers, because the news,  the updates are so immediate with computers that they're going to seem obsolete an hour 
[02:25:30]  after they come out.  It's like, people are going to get so used to news.  Even when you're reading the paper now, you're reading sometimes, like, the sports score  from last night.  Once it becomes convenient, they say book deals are going to go away.  Here's the problem.  Here's the problem.  Here's the problem.  But they have book readers right now.  Book readers right now, they have some of them.  Yeah, I think they're getting thinner and smaller.  Here's the problem.  It's $400 for a fucking book reader.  Why don't you just go buy the books?  Yeah, but you can carry around 400 books with you.  But you can't read 400 books.  Yeah, but you can't read 400 books. 
[02:26:00]  You can't even read one.  Your eyes fall out of your fucking head, first of all.  You can't look at a screen.  A lot of people read papers on the go.  They don't get them at home except for the Sunday paper.  A lot of people are at work, whatever.  You have your handheld device, whatever the fuck it is.  If you are looking at a newspaper or something on your little, it's going to kill your eyes.  You can't read an entire book online.  It's going to be like the size of a paper.  And they actually, like the book readers, if you ever had a book reader, they recreated paper on the screen. 
[02:26:30]  So your eyes, it's not a glowing computer screen.  It's still an LCD screen.  Yeah, and it kills your eyes.  Yeah, but it's recreated a piece of paper.  I spent days looking at the computer too long, and you wake up with computer hangover the next day  where your eyes are just like watering and fucking hurting.  That wasn't from the porn you were looking at?  No.  But the reason I say that is...  My dick was watering, too.  If you go back and look at issues of Wired Magazine from 1995, 1980s, they're saying the same shit. 
[02:27:00]  But what I'm saying is, they've been saying, newspapers are dead, dude.  No, every time a new media comes along, the old media doesn't just...  No, they're saying newspapers are dead.  You just said...  What I'm saying is, if you're listening, you're getting a little carried away with yourself.  I agree with us.  What happens is that they're going to have...  The newspapers aren't going to be around forever.  Just like CDs and tapes and video games.  You're not going to have to go buy a video game.  You're just going to be able to download it from your fucking TV. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, you mean like Grand Theft Auto 4 Episode 1, which comes out next year, downloadable for the Xbox 360?  We're in the future already, lass.  You don't even have to go out and buy Grand Theft Auto 4 for the PC, which came out today.  You could download it.  Exactly.  By the way, this is why Bob should be shot.  This is the same argument I had with Bob a few years ago.  I agree with you.  Paper money.  I agree with you.  But I actually came back to you later and said, you know what?  I made a mistake.  Paper money will eventually disappear.  It won't exist.  It'll always be around. 
[02:28:00]  Nah, but in time, it won't be.  People that are impoverished will always need...  A bunch of nickels.  Money.  Silver.  I'm saying it might be in 100 or 200 or 300 years, but it just won't be a viable...  People like, we don't use that anymore.  It's good for nothing anymore, because everything will be so confused.  But they'll say, like, we do not use that anymore.  And they'll be bald.  They'll touch you with their finger.  Yes.  They won't be bald.  Look at him.  No, it'll be past that point where baldness is like the norm.  We're evolutionary losing our hair.  If you have hair, you're silly.  Then you'd go to, like, the medical... 
[02:28:30]  It would be medical hair removal.  Is every restaurant going to be Taco Bell, too?  Oh, just like in, uh...  What movie?  What movie?  Demolition Man.  Yes, yes.  But people are always going to want physical currency.  Yeah.  I think it makes you feel sick.  No.  I don't want every transaction I made tracked, because then you could look and say, look,  Lazlo bought an ounce of weed yesterday.  But if you would have said that 200 years ago...  Yeah, but how are you going to buy weed?  Yeah, how are you going to buy drugs?  Are they going to carry...  Really, gold is what makes our money worth something. 
[02:29:00]  How are you going to get something?  Who carries around gold blocks?  To Louis C.K.?  We've been off the gold standards for a while now.  Louis C.K.  Carrying around gold nuggets in his pocket.  Nuggets.  Why?  It all is going to disappear.  I don't know.  He likes gold.  All disappear.  I think money is necessary, physical.  Yeah, how are you going to get a whore with a chip or a credit card?  Yeah, yeah.  You're going to just scan a transaction.  Scan it through a pussy?  Quad loops.  In a transaction, well, there obviously would be a way to pass them. 
[02:29:30]  I bid 400 quad loops for the whore.  I bid 800 quad loops.  A thousand quad loops for the asshole.  Look at credit cards.  Credit cards are the first step.  First step in that.  I would never use a credit card to get a whore, a massage, anything.  I know, but technology is not going to be built on how do you get a hooker with it.  They'll figure that out.  They will figure that out.  You understand, technology always goes to sex.  No, I know.  It does.  And eventually it will.  But look at credit cards.  Now they're talking about little chips in baby's hands just to make sure your kid doesn't get kidnapped. 
[02:30:00]  Eventually that will be standard.  Wait, let me get this straight.  Uncle Paul.  So the baby's got a chip in its hand and what does it do?  Slice them thin.  You track the kid so the kid gets kidnapped.  You can satellite track the kid.  And instead of looking for a kid for three days, all of a sudden the kid's missing for 45 minutes.  Not if you chop the hand off.  Then all you'll find are chopped off baby hands and a raped body in a shallow grave without a hand. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, a pile of inoculated arms.  Inoculated arms.  Well, there will be a way around that, obviously.  They'll put it in different places.  Let's say for the sake of argument that the killers aren't just chopping off arms as fucking kids.  Little lojacks for kids, right.  They'll be able to find kids.  And eventually that will become standard practice because it's needed.  And then all of your medical information will be inside little chips.  And instead of the paranoia about the government getting you, it'll be a convenience.  All transactions have gone through that.  In some businesses now with high security, they actually have chips. 
[02:31:00]  Instead of keys or cards, they have chips in people's wrists.  And they just wave their hand over the thing like you would a key, a credit card key.  And it opens the door.  It will eventually.  For high security places.  It will eventually be, again, maybe not our lifetime, that's actually now.  They have that on the news, yeah.  But why would you, why is that so incomprehensible to us?  It's not.  When X amount of years ago, like when computers were first talked about and they said six gigs,  it's all you'll ever need for the rest of your life.  And here we are ten years later, I have a 200 gig hard drive that's full of porn and movies 
[02:31:30]  that I need a new one.  It's like, it's constantly changing.  It's like, why do we think that's so incomprehensible?  I don't know, because it's kind of the same thing, only more of it.  But, um, they get better.  It's not this drastic change of something that, brand new, that comes out.  Computers have been around for fucking, the abacus is a computer, technically speaking.  And people, people's home computers are not, home computers are very recent.  Yeah, portable.  Like, the average, every house has one now. 
[02:32:00]  Like, I remember when email, I remember Florentine was doing an email joke.  I'm not going to get email, the girl's like, email me.  He's like, how about I'll F mail you?  Fuck you.  Like, because this is like, you know, 10, 12 years ago.  Bam, bam, bam.  Yeah.  Yeah, I didn't say it was fucking, you know, it was fucking Pryor's, you know, bicentennial  nigger closing bit.  Just saying that it was funny.  But that's where we were at.  Like, I'm not getting email.  And I held off on CDs even.  And now we're on cassettes.  What do you want?  You were that guy?  Yeah, I was.  Yeah, fuck you.  I got a cassette.  Dude, the pure sound of vinyl. 
[02:32:30]  But you know what I mean?  Look where records are.  They're obsolete.  Look where CDs are.  They don't even make them anymore.  And that's, I mean, I'm sorry, cassettes.  Yeah, yeah.  Totally gone.  So why don't you think other technologies will just come and go within 20 years be gone?  Do you think movie theaters are going to be gone?  Of course they were.  A few terrorist attacks in movie theaters.  And fucking the bottom line is, or one more plague type disease, like fucking AIDS that  you can catch through the virus.  And yes, when you can download movies immediately to your house, absolutely.  The same way fucking the record stores are closing.  Now, get a Voodoo box.  I mean, live, like, they're not, they're not, it's not like home theaters are just all 
[02:33:00]  of a sudden, you know, there'll be a way to do it where everybody watching.  Xbox 360 and Netflix.  But you get the Voodoo box, it's like 5,000 movies right in your house.  I'm getting the Kaleidoscape system.  It's the same system that pretty much like you just talked about.  Yeah.  It's for my, for my home theater.  And it downloads, downloads the movies.  And keeps them, thousands of them. 
[02:33:30]  It has the first 30 seconds of every movie.  That's what the Voodoo box is.  That's all it is.  No, it's, it's, mine is, is movies.  Full, full movies.  It has them all on there.  Yeah.  So I don't, I won't have to put in a DVD.  I can if I want, but I won't have to.  I, I just, uh, press the remote.  A display of every movie that I have goes up on the screen.  And then I just scroll through them, pick one, and it starts playing.  I just tossed all my DVDs.  Did you really?  Yeah, fuck them.  I don't fucking ever.  I threw my DVD player out.  I don't have a fucking.  Why the anger? 
[02:34:00]  What do you use?  Really?  I just hate my fucking DVD player.  I love DVD.  Dirty fucking DVDs.  How many DVDs did you throw out?  You lazy fucking DVD.  I put them all in a fucking, um, I put them in like a thing that holds like little CDs.  And I just have my great dramas in one.  Like these little, uh.  Look at you all organized.  But it's, it's a small area.  Modi taught me this.  What if you find comedy in the drama section?  Do you just lose your fucking mind?  Bite it.  That happened to me one time.  I found comedy in the drama section and I just pondered it.  Palazzo, you don't think that papers will eventually disappear when the sales go down 
[02:34:30]  so much because people just not buying them?  Like, like, who would have thought Tower Records would fucking go away?  Uh, that was, that pretty much spelled the end of the DVD.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or the CD, rather.  Yeah, but if you could just have a, have a piece of paper, uh, electronic piece of paper  at your house, Wi-Fi, which they basically have now with the, uh, Kindle, uh, Amazon book  reader, and it just automatically downloads whatever newspapers or RSS feeds you have while  you're sleeping.  When the paper comes out anyways at four in the morning, just bang, you wake up and all 
[02:35:00]  your shit's right there.  I'm awake.  I mean, I read the New York Times on my iPhone, you know, before I even get out of bed.  I read more shit online than I do in newspapers.  But it's nice getting that physical paper still.  Yeah, but I think it's going to be gone, dude.  The papers will eventually stop being made because they won't be, they won't be selling.  So they won't be any, they'll just go out of business.  And I'll tell you what else is good, and you can see this online too, they actually have  the piece of paper, the, whatever it is, but you know, like, uh, in Harry Potter where  the pictures change?  Yeah.  They, that will happen with that newspaper.  They have that where the photos will change on the, uh, front page. 
[02:35:30]  That's the future.  Like, you'll actually see somebody moving.  Like, you'll see, uh, you know.  I think you're tripping.  I think you're, but you're forgetting a crucial component, is that everybody in this room  has, you know, the income to get an iPhone and that kind of silly shit.  Yeah.  What about a construction worker that just wants to read about Britney's fucking recent  escalation?  The prices come down.  Papers will give them for free with a subscription like they do with XM.  You know, certain things you get, you'll have to buy the New York Post or the Times subscription. 
[02:36:00]  You'll still pay that.  They'll still make their money, but, and they'll be like, here, you can take our Times  reader for nothing.  And it'll be cheaper because they don't have to fucking manufacture the paper.  They just have to basically write the articles and then boom.  How much money they save doing that?  Without the distribution?  Shut down those big machines?  Kill all those fucking people?  Stop the presses permanently.  And how about VCRs?  How much were VCRs when they first came out?  Rich people had VCRs.  Oh my God.  It had to be 10, 20 bucks.  Remember trying to plug it in? 
[02:36:30]  How fucking crazy was that?  It was three plugs and everybody just lost their minds.  I remember one of the first porno magazines I'd ever seen as a kid had an ad for some VHS  tapes in the back.  And they were like $200 for like a VHS or Betamax Terminator or something like that.  Yeah.  If you rented a movie and didn't return it.  Oh, dude.  It was like $100.  It was very expensive.  Because I used to work at Sound Warehouse where we rented both Beta and VHS.  Oh.  Beta.  Wow.  Yeah.  And somebody like it fell off the back of their motorcycle or something like that. 
[02:37:00]  The guy came in with the pieces and we had to charge him like $110.  $100.  Wait, wait.  For this fucking piece for Animal House?  Back then.  What year did you work there?  Probably like 95 or something like that?  95?  No.  13 years ago.  I don't remember.  No, I'm talking like 87.  Okay.  20 years later, both of those technologies are pretty much obsolete.  Videotapes are still being made.  Beta's gone.  But Beta's gone.  They barely make it.  They won't make it for long.  Look at video cameras.  All right.  Tapes are gone.  Now video cameras are high def. 
[02:37:30]  High definition.  1080i.  720p.  And it all goes on a SD card.  There's no more tapes for video cameras.  I don't use tapes.  But there's an argument that newspapers are going to go away.  I just don't buy it.  Absolutely.  Newspapers have been around for...  They're not going to go...  Newspapers are going to be there, but they're not going to be paper form.  You're not going to flip through them.  That, holding it up, is going to go away.  Yeah.  They have it online.  They have it online.  No way.  All the money they spend...  Danny.  They have electronic newspapers online.  On paper, on production, on shipping, on manpower. 
[02:38:00]  They will save money by doing that because they're losing money now.  I'm with you.  But a construction worker doesn't want to carry around a $300 fucking stupid faggoty Kindle.  They want a 75 cent paper that they can throw on the ground.  A construction worker would love to have one thing he can put in his pocket and open up  and read everything.  And they will become affordable.  Construction workers all have cell phones.  Every average person has a cell phone.  Every average person has a DVD player now.  Things that were considered luxury items 10 years ago. 
[02:38:30]  Not everybody had video games like Grand Theft Auto.  Now on PC.  See the plug I just squeezed in there for you?  That's nice.  Thank you.  That is very nice.  Me and Anthony worked as a team on that one.  Get home.  Play this.  With your fingers.  A key.  B key.  D key.  Keyboard and mouse.  That's the way to go.  Fuck.  Suck.  Dude, I love first person shooters.  I finally finished Call of Duty 4 the other day.  It's Call of Duty 5, dude.  Get it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  That's fucking great.  That one's the shit.  But I suck multiplayer because it's a console game and I suck with the control. 
[02:39:00]  I fucking literally outline the person with the bullets and they turn around and blast  me with one shot.  I cannot fucking aim.  Change your settings.  I'm constantly overshooting the aim.  I've changed the settings.  I've changed the sensitivity on it.  I can't fucking aim.  Get a bigger TV.  Got a huge TV.  What size?  I can't wait to play it.  Well, I got, uh, what is my living room one?  Fifty, fifty two. 
[02:39:30]  How many speakers?  Are you going 9.1 in that surround sound theater?  Downstairs.  It's, uh, uh, beyond, uh, that.  It's, it's, it's, it's, I'm going.  There's, what's beyond 9.1?  Dolby 11 is the best.  Dolby 11 is the best time you can get.  What do you want?  What do you want?  Jesus Christ.  How many speakers?  Um, let me see.  One, two, three, four, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, five, six, six speakers, 
[02:40:00]  three subwoofers.  So then it's a 5.1 system.  All right.  That doesn't, that doesn't sound right.  I would think they would at least put a 9.1.  Yeah.  Because even Xbox Live now is 9.1.  Yeah.  Because they want us to do, uh, like the video game trailers that we upload to Xbox Live.  They want it in a 9.1 surround.  Which at some point, it's just, do you really need 10 speakers?  Um.  Yes.  I guess so.  This is, uh, this has to have a genuine movie theater look and sound. 
[02:40:30]  So it's going to look and sound.  Oh, you're going to have the drapes, like the crazy drapes that cover the screen.  It's going to look, I don't know about the drapes.  There will be some kind of faux curtain up front, but, um, the whole thing is going to  have a very art deco look to it.  How about a popcorn machine?  Uh, I could get one of those, but those are kind of hack for home theaters.  Yeah, but have pussy in it.  Oh, look.  Have popcorn pussy.  Have one of those claw games that comes down and it picks up the pussy and then just right  before it drops it in the thing, it lets it go. 
[02:41:00]  Actually, just have a chick's head in it and you can stick your cock in it.  A fucking head.  And fuck her mouth machine.  Do they make those?  A fuck her mouth machine?  I haven't seen one.  I'll look for it.  You push your button, like whack-a-mole, little heads come up and you just jam your dick.  Heads come up and you just shove your dick in them real quick.  Yeah.  I'll look out for that one, but no.  Just make it.  Use some of your fucking, your millions to make a whack-a-mouth.  I, um, I think I have the whole area pretty much planned out. 
[02:41:30]  How many seats?  What's going on down there?  It's going to be, um, uh, 13 if they were single seats, but then two of them are going  to be, uh, recliners.  They're all recliners.  Motorized recliners.  You could just be a dick and put one.  But two of them are going to be love seats where, you know, you could sit there with  your, with your sweetie and, uh, you know.  Just put one.  No middle, no middle armrest.  It could just be you and a burglar down there, isn't it?  That's it.  It's just me and a burglar.  Are you getting, are you getting a projection, uh, high def projection? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  It's the shit.  The ones that actually, even if there's light coming through, it still looks like a plasma?  It's not going to, it's, first of all, there won't be any light coming through this.  They're, they're painting the room entirely black and then on the sides are going to go  very dark material and then there's going to be deep, dark reds and then silver chevrons  with lights subdued behind it to look like very, uh, 1930s or 20s type movie theater.  It's going to be a projection that's that high def? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Are projections that good?  Awesome.  They're really good now.  Um, you know, if I wanted to just watch TV, I'll watch TV upstairs, but you want the experience.  It's an 11 foot screen.  Screen's 11 feet wide.  But they're high, they're really high def.  And the light, they make ones now that the light, like sunlight, doesn't even affect them.  I mean, it looks like a plasma on the wall.  Wow.  It'll, it'll, it'll be very cool to, uh, watch movies.  We can go over and watch some movies.  Well, you can watch the spackle dry right now.  They're still, you know, working on the spackle. 
[02:43:00]  Stick your cock in your popcorn and I'll fucking jerk you off.  How much does this thing cost in you?  A lot?  Uh, I'm not even quite sure of the exact cost yet.  Oh, 5 G's?  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Well, it's a, you know what it is?  I'm finishing the whole basement.  The whole basement's being finished.  So it's not just the theater.  There's a, uh, audio video studio going in downstairs.  There's a bar going in.  A bar?  Are you gonna put beer on top?  Yeah, hell yeah. 
[02:43:30]  I'm doing the Guinness thing.  How many, how are you?  I'm at least doing the Guinness thing.  Do you want me to set it up for you?  Uh, I got a wine cellar going in.  Um, it's, it's a lot of, it's an entire, it's the size of my house.  How about anything a teenager wouldn't want?  Just liquor and movies.  Well, that's what it is, pretty much.  And a place to make a duty on the floor.  And, uh, there's some flat screens going in around the bar.  A poker table is going in.  One of the real, you know, 10, 10 spot poker tables.  Uh, what the hell else are we doing? 
[02:44:00]  Oh, video games.  It's a millionaire's tree house.  Yeah, yeah.  It's basically what this amounts to.  It's like my little tree house.  How about an area for hats?  I will have an exclusive hat area.  You throw a big pile of hats and everybody can pick them up and put them on.  And, uh, old people will go in there and have their hats removed by Earl.  But, uh, Danny came up with a great idea, too.  There's a wall.  To rape girls?  Not sure.  Yeah.  There's a wall in there.  There's a rape room.  That's just one of my many ideas.  There's a rape room. 
[02:44:30]  There's a wall in there I wasn't sure what to do with.  So we're going to load up our asses with paint.  Yes, and just push our hairy asses against the wall and paint, uh, the, no.  Uh, the, the, one wall is going to have movie posters on there, of course.  Classic movie posters in the, in the lighted frames and everything like that.  And then, on the other wall, a glass case full of all the stupid movie memorabilia stuff  that I've gotten over the years from, uh, Big Kev. 
[02:45:00]  Things I've gotten signed here.  Uh, uh, uh, some of the movie-related toys and, uh, stuff from, from eBay.  All in a big case so people can see, look, that's the flux capacitor.  You're going to put your, uh, Han Solo encased in carbonite?  I'm putting my Bruce Campbell, uh, signed, uh, Ash doll in there.  It's pretty gay, dude.  Dude, that's where I can display all of my memorabilia. 
[02:45:30]  Uh, where else would I put it?  My office?  My office is supposed to look like it's from 1910.  You have an office?  Oh, does he have an office?  What does it look like?  It's, it looks like, uh, something, it's supposed to, it's going to look even better, but, uh.  It looks like a southern slave owner office.  Yes, a plantation owner office.  It's very plantation-like.  Picture Indiana Jones' private study.  Yes, yes.  That's exactly what it is.  That's what it is.  It's a mahogany, uh, walls with a, a very, um, old green wallpaper. 
[02:46:00]  And then, uh, mahogany desk.  And a mahogany wall unit.  Can I come over with a camera and do a, uh, an MTV Cribs on your pad?  Well, you could.  Right now it's being all gussied up for Christmas.  I got a Christmas tree in the living room now that is, um, 15 feet high.  Jesus.  Is it real?  No.  Oh, no.  It's a fake one.  What the hell is it?  I can put a 15-foot real tree in there. 
[02:46:30]  And I love how Anthony on his front door, he's got an NRA sticker, just so people, just  so people know.  That's it.  Plastered right there on the front door is my NRA sticker.  And I'm trying to figure out where to put the one that says, I am the proud owner.  Of a Magnum Research firearm, which is my, uh, Desert Eagle.  Which, uh, I had a little gun-related injury to my trigger finger yesterday at the range.  Shooting too many .50 caliber rounds.  Uh, did you burn yourself on the... 
[02:47:00]  It just, no, it, it, it ripped off my skin on my trigger finger.  Because the, the, the kick this thing gives is ridiculous.  Was it harder than you thought it would be to fire?  No, because I had it built up in my head that it was going to be ridiculous.  Like, it was going to fly me back 10 yards into the wall or something.  So it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  But it is the most powerful gun I've ever shot in my life.  And I've shot, you know, .357 Magnums.  Even more powerful than your cock?  Well, I've shot that gun and, uh, no, that's very powerful. 
[02:47:30]  But I didn't ever hurt my hand doing it.  And when he doesn't, when he shoots the Desert Eagle, he doesn't shoot into his own hand and  then eat the bullets.  Mmm, scrumptiddly-ish.  He doesn't clean the bullets out of his hand.  Is it gay if you eat your own cum?  Oh, yeah.  No.  If you chew it, it's bad.  It, uh, it, it really fucking gets squirrely on you, this gun.  You can, it's so big and heavy. 
[02:48:00]  The thing weighs, like, five pounds.  It's a pistol.  And it weighs about five pounds.  And the grip is very big on it.  So your right hand goes around the grip.  You gotta two-fist this fucking thing.  You can't just one-hand it.  You can't limp-wrist the fucking thing.  You gotta put your arms out straight and fire it like a goddamn man.  And hold it with two hands.  The thing is, your second hand now has to wrap kind of around your right hand, which is wrapped  around this big grip.  So you really can't get your left hand around your right hand enough to hold it there. 
[02:48:30]  So after you're firing a few rounds, you'll find that your right hand starts slipping out  of your left hand with the kick, and the gun goes a little sideways on you and kicks back.  Uh, it's really, it's hard to fucking shoot, uh, especially accurately.  It's hard to aim, huh?  Yeah, it's just a heavy gun, too, so it's hard to just hold your arm out and aim.  And you're anticipating that kick so much that it's very hard to aim, because you kind of 
[02:49:00]  concentrate more on this, it's gonna fucking really kick.  And it just ripped my finger, uh, apart.  How many caliber is a .357 Magnum chute?  .357.  Oh, so I don't know, what's a .50 cal?  What's the difference?  .50 cal is, it's about a half an inch.  Half an inch, and how big is .50?  .50 is, uh, .357 Magnum.  Oh, .357, .50, okay.  Right, right, right.  Okay, so .50 is like a half, .357 is a little more than a third.  Yeah.  Okay. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  Is it like a .50 cal, a .50 cal handgun?  And that's the same as the .50 cal?  It's not the same shell that goes into a machine gun, no.  Because a .50 caliber machine gun, literally, it can snap somebody's neck, just going by  their neck, not even hit it.  Yeah, yeah, this one will take a limb off.  If I shot you in the arm, your arm would...  Just come off.  ...it would come off.  There are videos on, you can watch YouTube videos of people shooting the Desert Eagle  into pumpkins, and the pumpkins just explode. 
[02:50:00]  Look at the muzzle fire.  Here, Danny's showing a video.  Look at the muzzle blast that's coming out of this fucking Desert Eagle.  It makes like a ring of fire that comes out.  Is yours silver or black?  Silver.  You got the silver?  All nickel.  Nickel?  It's all nickel.  Yeah, but it's a shined nickel.  Yeah, look at that.  It's a big fire ring that comes out of the front.  Jesus.  And then what I did was I took a...  I have some videos, and I was trying to upload them to YouTube last night, but apparently 
[02:50:30]  they were having maintenance last night.  I took one of my flip cams, the little flip video cameras, and hung it on the target and  wheeled the target out so you have a video view of what it's like to be shot at by the  Desert Eagle.  I shot just below the camera.  I'd be great if you shot your camera.  I know.  That's what everyone was saying, or Keith was saying, what if you shoot the camera?  I go, I think I'm a good enough shot where I'm not going to go that wild and shoot the 
[02:51:00]  camera.  I'll keep it in the head of the target.  Where's this gun range?  In your basement, too?  No, no.  The range is by Nassau Coliseum.  Oh, really?  Yeah, there's a range back there.  What, is it inside?  Yeah, indoor range.  You ever go to Calverton?  Yeah, I go out there in the summer.  With some serious rednecks out on the eastern.  I go out there in the summer and bring the rifles out there.  It's hard to take a rifle into an indoor range.  You don't have that far to shoot.  So it's kind of, it defeats the purpose of taking a rifle down there.  But the pistols are hysterical.  Do people at the range look at you like you're a psychopath?  One guy was like, it's a goddamn cannon. 
[02:51:30]  It just, it was so loud.  And me and Keith both had them.  So it was so obnoxious.  It was nothing but boom, boom, boom, boom.  Just real loud.  And almost flying out of our hands.  And then I freaking, like I said, my finger just kind of busted open on the trigger.  So I had to go to my little 40.  Pop, pop, pop.  If you had shot yourself in the head with that, would the, excuse me, if someone wanted to  shoot themselves in the head, would the gun jerk, pull you away and actually probably 
[02:52:00]  scar you?  No, it would blow your head off and then the gun would fly, fly away somewhere.  Or you, because obviously you're dead, you're not able to hold it.  Oh, what is that?  It's shooting through what?  A cinder block and a pumpkin?  Somebody, they set up a pumpkin behind a brick and then took about five shots to it.  And the first shot, the brick explodes, exposing the pumpkin.  And then he pumps four more shots into the pumpkin that leave giant, like, inch and a half 
[02:52:30]  holes.  It's a sick hole.  Usually when you shoot a target at the range with a smaller caliber gun, it'll make a hole  in the target, but it's one of those holes that the paper kind of tears around the back.  So if you take the target, you kind of almost push the paper back where it was.  This removes a half an inch of paper from the target.  Just removes it.  It puts giant holes in the target.  But, uh, and you can only imagine what, yes, it's expensive, but ammo is very expensive. 
[02:53:00]  How much is a bullet?  Uh, 20 rounds is $50.  Jesus.  $250 a bullet?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Jesus, like smoking.  $250 a bullet.  Nice hollow point.  Fucking.  Why do you?  Just nasty.  Why do you shoot hollow point?  Isn't there a cheaper bullet while you're just practicing?  Because it's, uh, much better to a, there probably is for a target shooting.  I, I, I don't think I need a hollow point, but it's all they had at the store. 
[02:53:30]  I bought them all.  I bought them out too.  Keith went there to get some ammo and he goes, um, we're all out.  Some guy came in and bought all the 50 caliber ammo and Keith was like, yeah, I know who that  was.  So he came over and took some.  Do they have an automatic handgun?  What?  Like, yeah, the closest they have is like an Uzi or a Mac 10 or a Tech 9 or.  They don't make like a handgun though?  Things like that.  You see them in movies.  When are you going to get seven shots out of a machine gun type thing? 
[02:54:00]  You know, it's one of those, you get like a Tech 9 is a machine pistol.  They call them machine pistols.  Uh, Mac 10 and an Uzi is a bigger version, but, uh, yeah, cause you need room for the  ammo to put that in.  You need some kind of barrel length for a machine gun.  You can't really shoot out of a six inch barrel or something like that.  You are so lucky during the burglar incident that that chick didn't pick up a gun and  shoot you in the face.  Absolutely. 
[02:54:30]  Because dude, if she was willing to burn shit in your backyard, she's willing to pick up  a gun and blow your face off.  Dude, I looked at that gun, knew where it was and unloaded it immediately.  I pulled the clip, I put it in the drawer and I kept the clip on me.  So I knew to get rid of any weapons that could have done anyone any bodily harm.  That's how I roll.  But that doesn't mean that she couldn't have come over the next day and blown my head  off. 
[02:55:00]  Right.  It happens.  Would you, if you, if you saw her coming in with a gun, would you just go and grab one  of your guns and have a fucking duel?  I don't know what I would do in that circumstance.  That'd be pretty hot though.  She's got your machine gun or big, big tits.  Yeah.  Just kind of rattling around.  Yeah.  That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that.  I'd be looking going, wow, I'm being shot.  This sucks.  Right.  Actually, um, I actually racked the 40 the other night. 
[02:55:30]  It was about midnight and you're a knock on the door.  And, uh.  That's usually how that, how it starts.  Yes.  Knock on the door.  Dude, you must have had the biggest heart on you.  Like, here it goes.  I get to shoot a black person.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  No, it was a Hispanic gentleman was, uh, looking in my side window, uh, beside, by the  door.  Did you kill him?  Uh, no.  I, uh, took out about two panes, two panes of glass, a fight over his head. 
[02:56:00]  No.  I, I, uh, but I did, uh, remove my weapon.  I racked around, chambered it, put the weapon back in my holster and, and went to the door.  Oh, now what were you wearing?  Were you in your boxers?  Uh, no, I was fully dressed.  I had been to the range.  So, um, I had, uh, my, my 40 on.  You walk around the house with the thing in a holster?  Well, not all the time.  Well, at all?  But if I go to the range.  At all? 
[02:56:30]  Yes.  So you'll come home from the range, you just walk around the house with it?  And then I'll, I'll just leave it on until I go to bed.  Why not?  So, like, when you go home today and pop your fucking Percocet, do you strap on your, your 50 cal?  Uh, no, the 50, uh, is not a carry weapon.  I'll, I'll carry the, the 40.  The, uh, HK.  But, but that is, that state of procedure when you're like, oh, that was a good show.  Let me strap the gun on and walk around the house.  No, because I go out, I gotta do, you know, things to do.  So if I leave the house, I'm, I'm definitely, you know, packing. 
[02:57:00]  And then.  If you leave the house.  Yeah.  So you get in your car with the gun, like, go to the, I go to the range.  I blast off a few rounds.  No, but if you just go into the store, are you carrying a gun?  Uh, sometimes.  So if somebody, if somebody comes over your house, you might have a gun, just a holster  and a gun on and, hey, what's up?  Come on in.  I'm just cooking some food and you're cooking.  Well, they won't see it.  With a gun on?  It's concealed.  It's a concealed weapon.  So it's, you know, under my shirt. 
[02:57:30]  But I, uh, I did, you know, rack it and then put it back in the holster and then went to  the door to find out what the gentleman wanted.  And what did he want?  He apparently was looking for a different number.  Ten numbers up from my house to deliver some, um, food.  Yeah.  When he saw the bulge in your jacket, he was looking for a different number.  He was cute.  Was he?  With a bulge.  No, it's an asshole.  No, I wasn't.  I didn't think I'm going to shoot this guy.  I thought if this is some kind of a thing where you open the door and then people barge 
[02:58:00]  in and it's a push-in home invasion, what am I supposed to do?  Take it.  What?  Take it.  Yeah, take it like a man.  Don't be such a pussy.  Take the home invasion like a man.  Yeah, take it right in the ass and fucking deal with it.  That's what I'm going to do.  You know, that's how it happens.  There's a knock on the door and then before you know it, you open the door, crack, ask  who it is and they say a number of this and you open it up and then, uh, there you are  tied up, getting beaten. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, your wife or your girl is getting ravaged by savages.  She's loving it.  What are you doing?  Shut up.  She's winking at you.  You're the cuckold.  I got it.  You're a little cuckold just sitting there.  You got to go and clean the bowl afterwards.  Bowl's got to be cleaned.  You're filling up with blood pouring down in your eyes when she gets raped by two strange  men.  No, you, you, you're ready for action.  That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  You, you, you're, you're prepared for a bad situation. 
[02:59:00]  You hope it doesn't happen, but, uh, that's, that's what happens.  Have you watched a scene in a movie with a guy that does happen with a guy is tied up  and then the other two guys or whatever start, you know, you know, messing around with the  chick right in front of the guy.  No, I've seen that movie.  Does that turn you on at all?  No, no.  It's so disturbing.  It gets you mad to think of that.  Yeah.  It doesn't turn you on at all.  No.  You're like, uh, no, it's so disturbing that, uh, I can't even, uh, I can't even think about 
[02:59:30]  it in terms of being hot.  Yeah.  Me neither.  It's just, you, you're, you're completely, you are completely taken with that situation.  You think it's amazingly hot.  Don't you?  I can't tell you how many times that turns me on.  Why?  I don't know.  Do you have a rape fantasy, Bobby?  Yeah.  I'd love, yeah, both sides.  You'd love to be raped.  Both sides.  I'd love to be raped.  Just push down on the floor.  You, now, come on, your lovely wife, you would, you would, you're, you get hot thinking  about gentlemen coming in and, and taking her against her will. 
[03:00:00]  Not reality.  Screaming in horror as, as this is happening to her.  No, I'm not screaming to Bob, get out.  This is your cue.  You're ruining it.  Yeah.  That's reality, my friend.  Not that, but like, you know, like maybe a chick I was dating.  Like, is it wrong that it would be kind of sexy if, uh, if a girl that you were seeing,  say, was like fucking somebody in front of you and like slapping your face?  No. 
[03:00:30]  I, I find that incredibly horrid and degrading and, and, and sad.  The humiliation straightens you right out.  The humiliation straightens you out?  Yeah.  I don't need to be humiliated.  I have no, uh, ambition to be humiliated.  You guys seem to have this thing where in some way, shape, or form you enjoy to an extent  some form of humiliation.  Who doesn't?  Me.  I don't.  I don't like to be humiliated at all. 
[03:01:00]  I don't.  It's not a thing.  I, I dislike it more than you like it.  That's how much I dislike being humiliated.  I don't like to feel humiliated.  You like being humiliated.  I don't like it that much.  Not like, not, I don't like to be in like sexually you talking about?  No.  Any kind of like humiliation.  If, if there's a chick that you're seeing and she's also getting fucked by some other  guy and she's smacking you in the face. 
[03:01:30]  Exactly.  Straightens you right out.  What?  I'd tell him to hit her.  Get her to stop doing it.  See, but just he, that he's fucking her is humiliating you in front of you.  No, it's not humiliating.  It's not that he's deep dicking her right.  Yeah.  In front of you.  If you looked over and she, she was getting all of a sudden, it's like, oh, stop, stop.  And then she was like, oh, God.  Oh my God.  That is so disturbing.  You, you, first of all, they both get killed and then you shoot yourself.  That's a murder suicide. 
[03:02:00]  Or you just go my way and jerk off.  What's the matter with you?  How about, how about this scenario?  She's getting fucking plowed, right?  And she's like, no, stop.  And you're sitting there.  You're like, oh, you know, you're tied up, whatever.  And then like right in the middle of it, right?  All of a sudden she goes, oh God.  And then she reaches over and grabs your cock.  No, I don't want to be involved in this.  Get me out of this house.  You're insane.  What are these weird fantasies you have, bro?  They're crazy humiliation fantasies.  There's no, why would you want that? 
[03:02:30]  Because you're a cuck boy.  Sometimes a sissy cuck boy needs, what a sissy cuck boy needs?  I am no sissy cuck boy.  Sissy cuck boy.  No, this just coming in from sissy cuck boy.  I'm sure somebody on a whack bag will be sissy cuck boy.  The sissy cuck boy.  Oh, yes, it's sissy cuck boy again.  Yeah, sissy cuck boy from Ronkonkoma.  From the Ronkonkoma sissy cuck boys?  Sissy cuck boy. 
[03:03:00]  No, there's no, I have no.  You've never put on a pair of panties and serviced a bull.  No, I can say I've never done that.  So, I mean, look, I was thinking about this the other day.  Like, guys like you, there's a certain, there's a certain, there's a certain, who else was  in your fantasy?  Guys like who and who?  Like me and you, I hit a certain creep, we, sexually, we went a certain route in life.  And guys like him, kind of just normal.  Like, you never went the fucked up sexual route at all. 
[03:03:30]  You've had normal relationships.  I don't know.  Well, he was having three ways.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That he's paid millions for.  That is a very expensive three ways.  But Ant's not a deviant, he's saying.  Ant's pretty much, not Ant's not a good bang, but Ant's a guy that likes to get a girl naked  and jam his fucking hog in her and bang away.  Anthony doesn't require armpits smelling his face from a chick.  Right.  I like that.  No, no, I don't require that. 
[03:04:00]  You never licked 80 girls' armpits out like a pussy?  No, not an armpit.  Do you have a finger fucker at the same time?  What's wrong?  Get that white deodorant on your tongue.  Fuck deodorant?  What are you fucking, what's wrong with you?  Rookie?  Way to go, fucking Captain Square.  No, there's no, I have no aversion to a clean girl and the way she smells as far as armpits  go. 
[03:04:30]  I'm not going to make an effort to shove my mouth in there and start licking her armpit.  It doesn't matter if it's a little raw.  Like a pussy.  A little raw in the armpit.  Yeah, a little hair.  Like a little stink through the shirt.  A little stink through the shirt.  I like that.  I don't, I actually don't mind a little, uh, uh, a scent coming off of a, yeah, stubble.  A little scent coming off of a girl.  Um, it doesn't creep me out or disgust me.  A little bit.  No, down there has got to be pretty clean.  Oh, no.  Um, a meaty fucking pussy with a lot of folds in it. 
[03:05:00]  That makes me want to puke.  I'm not going to write it.  Oh, stop the two of you.  Why don't you just go to Goody Two-Shoes Town?  Let me pull up Google.  Yeah, there's a street view.  I want to get a street view.  As long as your Google Maps doesn't crash on you.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Where's Goody Two-Shoes Town?  I can't tell.  Safari kicked me off.  No, there's nothing, uh, more disgusting than uncleanliness, uh, and an odor because of uncleanliness down there.  Not uncleanliness, but she's sweaty, she didn't shower today, you fucking, uh, the asshole has a little stink to it. 
[03:05:30]  I've been to enough strip clubs where strippers fit that criteria.  They're sweating a little, they've been working.  Uh, I go for a lap dance and she decides, uh, because I'm a heavy tipper, that the, uh, muff is going right in my fucking face.  And I backed off, like, like, ugh, I'm trying to think of a good, okay, when, in, uh, in Reservoir Dogs, when, uh, the cop is sitting there and is getting the gun pointed in his face, and he's turning his head back and forth. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah.  That was me at the strip club.  But why were you like a toddler being fed, like, strained peas or something?  Yeah, I didn't want it.  I don't like a stinky...  I was Marvin Nash.  With the gun, with the gun being pointed at his face.  That was me.  No!  Ah!  I'm sitting down, I'm, like, sitting on my hands, because he can't touch them, and I'm just like, get, I, get away!  No! 
[03:06:30]  Don't do this!  Don't do this!  You don't have to do this!  You, you finished?  You're done?  I don't care what you say or don't say.  I'm gonna put my stinky, sweaty pussy in your face anyway.  Yeah.  And you're gonna smell it.  You can scream all you want.  You're gonna smell it.  Don't want to.  Please don't pull the panties aside.  Actually, it should have been Steeler's Wheel playing, but that's alright.  There you go.  Is that the wrong song?  This is the song where he's doing a little dance with the knife before he cuts his ear off. 
[03:07:00]  And he's torturing him.  This is the greatest.  Every time, that shot of him just kind of turning around with the blade, looking at him and doing that stupid little dance.  The horrified Marvin Nash watching him.  Dude, he's dancing with your ear in his hand.  Hello?  Hello?  And then he just throws it like a piece of trash.  When a guy is doing, when a guy slices off your ear and does the torture dance, you are in fucking Dutch. 
[03:07:30]  You are, as they say, in a pickle.  Yeah, exactly.  He fucking, he was gonna set him on fire.  Yeah.  Don't burn me.  I have kisses.  Don't burn me.  Marvin Nash.  That was one of the most disturbing scenes I've ever seen.  Horrific.  It was great.  Love that movie.  Yeah, but that's how my face was going on the stripper.  Okay, I need more cleanliness.  If there's a smell from sweat and not washing, no.  It's like banging a waitress. 
[03:08:00]  Their boxes are always hot and sweaty because they've been running around all day.  In and out of the kitchen.  Who the fuck are you?  Then you go.  Slow from, yeah.  Who are you fucking, Alice?  Take him in after the night.  Vic Tayback's ass.  Nice comedy show.  Stow it, dingy.  Stow it, dingy.  What do you say, dingy?  Kiss my sweaty grits.  Yeah.  And Flo would be in the back.  Fucking with a rolling pin in her twat.  Fucking stupid beehive hairdo.  Vic Tayback giving a deep dick in with his big hairy balls. 
[03:08:30]  I bet you Vic Tayback had a giant wart or mole on one side of his bag.  You know those things fat people get on their necks?  Vic Tayback had that with a fucking skin tag on his ball sack.  A giant skin tag on the side of his sack.  Hey, what about the cheeks of my ass?  I'm gonna come down your throat.  You fucking well better swallow it all.  You let one drop spill and I'll whip your ass so hard you won't sit down for it.  Yeah.  Do we have those fucking, I would love to hear those different strokes clips of Mr. Carlson. 
[03:09:00]  Oh yeah, we do have those.  Great.  Forgot about that.  We can all get our dicks hard.  Yeah.  Let's all pull out and start jacking.  Anyone got a cracker?  Is that when they went over to his place and he was watching and they were like, I've got  some great cartoons.  Yeah, yeah.  He puts a video in.  We were watching the video earlier but without sound.  And we just had to hear it.  It's the guy, Mr. Carlson from WKRP in Cincinnati and he has little Arnold and Dudley. 
[03:09:30]  Arnold's friend Dudley and they're sitting on the, oh Uncle Paul, and they're sitting on  the couch and apparently he puts a VCR tape in his top loader, VCR.  He paid $100 for that.  Yes, and the kids are watching and then, wow, they started making some strange faces.  So I guess it was inappropriate material.  Didn't one of them go take a bath with him or something? 
[03:10:00]  Dudley.  He wanted him to take a bath with him.  You're going to spoil all the fucking...  Yeah, I know.  That was a very special episode, by the way.  I remember watching it.  It was one of those that was supposed to teach kids, you know, because it was a lesson  in every fucking episode.  Yeah, don't bring a cock blocker friend like Arnold.  That's what was great about shows in the 80s.  It's just like, oh, it's a normal family, but oh, Phil Collins is here.  Yeah, yeah.  Hey.  He needs some help getting to the concert.  Yeah.  Celebrity walk-ins.  Yeah, it was so bizarre. 
[03:10:30]  Hey.  Hey.  We're just a white family with some black kids.  Oh, look, it's Nancy Reagan.  Hey, Nancy Reagan just came in with Mr. T.  Ew.  Was she on Different Strokes?  Oh, yes.  For her Just Say No campaign to drugs.  Wow.  Yeah.  They actually gave money to the studios and the networks back then to put anti-drug messages  into the script.  In the shows.  Really?  Yeah.  That was such a weird time.  All the shows were the same, too.  They had that dopey theme song at the beginning.  They all had the same look, the same set, different characters, but all the same MO. 
[03:11:00]  And they all had the same very special episodes.  It was either teen pregnancy, drug abuse, alcoholism, child molestation.  JJ's got the bottle of booze in the fucking toilet tank.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  JJ.  Hey, what happened to Skippy at the end of Family Ties?  Did he kill himself?  I'm dead serious.  I think Skippy dies in the end of the Super Bowl.  They couldn't possibly have ended that show like that.  I'm almost positive Skippy, Mark Price is in the show. 
[03:11:30]  Was that one of the episodes where they just show the credits and don't play the closing  music?  That was a very special episode where it would end with the audience going, oh.  And it would just, suddenly the credits would pop on.  And the credits would go on.  And because your TV was so bad, it had like a bad white to sound balance.  And it would buzz.  Depending on what names were on there and how many white letters were up on the screen.  All in the Family was good for that one.  Oh, jeez. 
[03:12:00]  How did, Danny, how did, what finally happened to Skippy at Family Ties?  One of the listeners will know.  Oh, wow.  Cool.  I miss the freeze frames.  Like at the end of Chips, you know.  Oh, that was the best.  The freeze frames were just the best.  They went overboard with the freeze frames, too, because they recapped the whole episode  in freeze frames.  The last 20 minutes was all freeze frames.  Or, yeah.  Or, no, no.  They actually carried on the episode with freeze frame. 
[03:12:30]  So if it stopped with Ponch trying to rape a chick, which he was always doing, trying  to use his police power in uniform to rape girls, they'd end the show and they'd laugh.  Ha, ha, ha.  Freeze frame of them laughing.  And then they'd go back to moving.  And John would look at Ponch like, nah, put your dick away.  And kind of give him that scolding look.  And they'd freeze frame that.  And then they're back to moving.  And Ponch would be pulling his fly down going, fuck you, cock blocker. 
[03:13:00]  And he's looking going, I'm sticking my dick in this bitch.  Freeze frame.  And they show the horrified woman's face.  Ah!  Freeze frame.  Ponch's unclipped savage cock pulled out of his police pants.  His baggy fucking chips pants.  Ha, ha, ha.  And then freeze frame of a big load being shot in the girl's face.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ah, you missed that episode, I guess.  That's right after he sang Celebrate Good Time. 
[03:13:30]  Come on.  That was the DVD extras.  They called it Drips.  Ha, ha, ha.  Because he came down his leg.  He got so excited.  And her crying.  Ha, ha, ha.  He shot goop into his own sock.  Ha, ha, ha.  Sock full of goop.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ah, freeze frame that.  Him pulling his pant leg away and going, ugh.  And freeze frame it.  He's going to be pulling fucking crazy glue off of his thigh leg, uh, hairs.  His Latin hairy calf.  Ha, ha, ha.  As he's riding his motorcycle. 
[03:14:00]  All those rolls of jizz that's stuck to the hair.  Like fucking rubber cement.  Ha, ha, ha.  And the fucking wind in his motorcycle is blowing the fucking, the cold liquid fucking,  and his goop in his pants against his calf.  He hates it.  His unclipped dick is sealed shut.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's awful.  He goes to piss.  It comes out like a sprinkler head.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  It's like the fucking, it's like the thing you squeeze frosting out of.  Ha, ha, ha.  It's a little shape.  You can make a rose with it.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[03:14:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  Okay.  Hey, is that Sam with punch?  It sure is.  Where did he get that picture?  Oh, wow.  What, did Eric Estrada having a stroke while they took that photo?  Yeah, now look at his face.  He looks like fucking Dick Clark.  I thought he got a picture with Deepak Chopra.  Yeah, he does have stroke face, doesn't he?  Yeah.  What's going on?  I don't know.  Where was that?  Maybe someone belted him after they bought some of that shit real estate he's been selling  on TV.  Yeah.  I bought a swamp, you cunt.  I'd rather live on the chick's deep...  Oh, no.  Chip's response just crashed. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, no.  Quick.  Bend me over and put that unclipped delicious treat in my face.  Oh, the tip smells like vinegar.  Someone's had a busy day on the police motorbike.  Oh, the skid marks punch must have had in those police drawers.  I bet you those big...  Sitting on that bike.  Those giant ethnic ass cheeks would probably open up and wrap around the seat.  Oh, God.  The yellow stains from just getting hard-ons and then going soft again. 
[03:15:30]  Looking at all the chicks.  Yeah.  Just pre-cumming everywhere.  Responds like a chimp every time he hears a female voice.  Just jumps up.  Pink dick.  Fucking punch.  Awful.  Every episode, they had to go to the park and watch bitches, like, roller skate.  Yeah.  It was like every fucking episode.  In hot pants.  Right.  And there was always that one black guy doing, like, the little boogie dance.  Oh, yeah.  With the boombox sitting next to him.  Same guy that fucking tried to get rerun to tape the Doobie Brothers.  He was the bad guy in every fucking awful show in the 80s. 
[03:16:00]  He was a perfectly quaffed afro.  He was great, that guy.  He was sweet daddy on Good Times, too.  Was he?  The pimp, yeah.  Yeah, the pimp.  Sweet daddy.  Where'd you meet...  Yeah, where'd you meet punch?  Where'd you meet punch?  That was at Chiller Theater.  That was the last Chiller Theater.  He was there in Greg Brady.  Signing autographs, was he?  What was Greg Brady doing?  Besides waving at everybody with gloves on.  Everyone had to shake his hand.  He grabbed me in really close, Eric Estrada. 
[03:16:30]  He wasn't comfortable.  Our faces were touching.  He's gritting his teeth.  Yeah.  Like, this kid's beautiful.  Yeah.  Oh, I love this kid.  What happened?  You know sitcom.  What happened to fucking Skippy at the end of Family?  Advertise.  Didn't he come down with alcoholism or something?  Like, didn't he start getting drunk or...  Did he?  Didn't he go nuts?  That sounds familiar.  Yeah, I think he had alcoholism.  I remember the episode where...  Wait a minute.  Wasn't there an episode where Tom Hanks was the drunk...  Oh, maybe that was right.  He was the drunk uncle or something. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  And he picked up Tina Yothers by her twat hair and threw her through the bay window?  Tina Yothers.  Tina Yothers.  And Michael J. Gross.  That's Michael J. Fox.  Michael J.  Michael J.  Michael J.  That's what happens when they morph together and the father just shook.  Yeah, they wound up giving the father a heart attack.  Did he die?  No, no, but they gave him a heart attack and then they had to, you know, acknowledge it  every episode. 
[03:17:30]  And then the uncle was Tom Hanks and he was a drunk.  And then Michael J.  Fox broke up with the first girlfriend.  Yes.  Who was...  What's her name from League of Their Own?  A tall, lanky fucking...  Penny Marshall.  Nell Carter.  Rosie O'Donnell.  She was that tall fucking redhead that was hot for 10 minutes.  Yeah.  The chick that was in The Fly?  Yes.  That's, uh...  Gina Davis.  Gina Davis.  Gina Davis.  Yeah. 
[03:18:00]  Is that the one where the guy moved in next door and he had a metal shoe and he would  kick fucking the mother in the box and make her pick either Baxter or Bernie?  He's like, choose the last name already.  You're bugging everybody.  Hyphenated cunt.  What happened to Skippy?  She wound up, uh, she did a lifetime special on breast cancer.  Who?  Meredith Baxter-Bernie.  Meredith Baxter-Bernie.  And, uh, it was very controversial because she showed her tits. 
[03:18:30]  Did she?  During a breast exam.  She was giving herself a breast exam and she found a lump, you know?  So, uh, they showed her giving the breast exam and kind of a side tit shot.  Nice.  And it was, um, very controversial.  Is that on YouTube?  Probably, yeah.  Everything's on YouTube.  This is your tits.  So, man, everything.  It's like, man.  We can't find it.  Man.  I'm trying.  I'm looking right now.  Okay.  Don't know what happened to Skippy?  Anyone?  Is there any listeners?  We got listeners out there who love us and love us.  There's people, uh, calling.  Maybe, uh, they knew what happened to Skippy. 
[03:19:00]  Can someone help us?  What happened to Skipperoo?  What happened to Skippy?  I don't think anything.  He enlisted in the Marines.  Happened to him.  Oh, he got killed in the NAMM.  Yeah, he got enlisted in the Marines.  He enlisted in the Marines.  No, he didn't.  That was the Wanderers.  Oh, right.  That was in the Port and Baldies.  Um, who was it?  They joined the Marines.  The Dutchies?  The Ducky Boys.  The Ducky Boys.  The Ducky Boys were in the fucking Wanderers, too.  He'll kill you.  Remember Perry?  And then Joey's father was the big abusive.  Yes.  He'll kill you, Perry.  Yeah, Perry.  Yeah, he was beating the Ducky. 
[03:19:30]  The father was picking up a Ducky Boy and swinging him into another Ducky Boy.  He was just beating a Ducky Boy with a Ducky Boy.  And he liked to break the bench.  He was happy to fucking rumble, that guy.  And what about that one guy that was kind of a fruit?  I thought we'd go to the park, me and you.  Go to the park.  Yeah, he was one of the Wanderers.  Wasn't he a...  No, he was one of the Baldies.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  They missed the shop.  Was he the same guy that was in Saturday Night Fever?  He was a fucking fruit in that thing?  No, no.  The little crybaby. 
[03:20:00]  Father, can I talk to you, Father?  Father, she loves to taste the communion wafers.  Maybe the Pope could get special...  What's it called?  Dispensation?  Isn't that the guy who was also in fame?  The Pope to get your girlfriend abortion?  Didn't he play Ralph Garcia in fame?  Yes, he did.  He was in fame, but it wasn't the same guy that was in Wanderers.  He was also in an episode of Beretta.  I met him in L.A., and I told him how watching him in fame bomb in front of his friends changed  the way I did comedy, like before I ever did it.  What?  He inspired you?  When I first...  Fame inspired you.  I never brought friends.  I wish he inspired you when he fell off the bridge on Saturday Night Fever. 
[03:20:30]  Creep.  Skippy does stand up.  His website is ijoke.tv.  It might have something up there.  That's an easy one to remember.  Jesus.  Haveitworked.com.  ijoke.tv.  If you get the .tv, what happened to Skippy?  Or his name.  Nothing happened to him in the episode? 
[03:21:00]  Steve, do you have a...  Skippy didn't...  Nothing happened to him in the series, but he did an excellent movie with Gene Simmons  called Trick or Treat.  Ozzy was in that.  Yeah, he was.  He played a priest.  That's why I said it.  Gene Simmons was in that movie with Tom Selleck also, with the little robots.  That was a good movie.  I liked that one.  It's pretty cool.  That's the one with the bullets?  Yeah, yeah.  That kind of chased you around.  The DNA or something?  Guided missile bullets.  Yeah.  Go around chorus. 
[03:21:30]  Yeah.  Run...  Run...  What was the name of it?  Run around or run away?  Run away?  No, you had it.  You already said it.  Run away.  No.  Thank you.  Yes, it is.  The cunning linguist says it is.  It's not run away.  It was run away.  It was not.  Gene Simmons, Tom Selleck.  Were they in a movie called Run Away?  Yes.  No, it wasn't.  It was called...  Gene Simmons was the bad guy.  We ended up getting shot up with a bunch of needles full of acid by some spidery looking  creatures.  Danny, do any of them know what happened to Skipperoo? 
[03:22:00]  What happened to Skippy?  Skippy went into the military is what...  Yeah, let's try Keith.  Keith from Hartford.  Yo, Keith.  Yo, boys.  How were you this morning?  All right.  Skippy went into the military.  He did.  I told you.  Yes, he did.  Wasn't there a death at the end of Family Ties?  He made that up.  If there was, I don't remember.  I remember him coming in and there was a death or something...  Something about a death.  There was a death.  You bought a death.  You got a death. 
[03:22:30]  Something about...  I don't know what it was.  He was trying to paint and all of a sudden things started acting up and he made a big  mess.  He finally realized that coloring books were no longer an option.  One of Alex's friends died in a car accident.  Oh, that's the one.  Oh, that was one too.  Yeah, yeah.  Was that the last episode or one of the ones?  It was in the last season.  That's where people went, oh.  And that's the one that they didn't run the music at the end.  It was just graphics that used to buzz over the black. 
[03:23:00]  I don't...  Well, are you sure?  Skippy went in the military.  Yeah, that's what's coming in a lot now.  Okay, I guess I was wrong.  I just made that up.  It came up.  There was a call.  Maybe.  A couple people on feedback, too.  Those fucking assholes don't know.  Get to the pedo shit.  Well, I was going to say, you guys want to take a quick break?  Because we didn't break yet.  A break?  What do we got a break for?  I got a piss.  All right.  I got to take a piss.  And Bob's been fucking bothering me.  He wants to take a look at it.  Oh, by the way, I took a piss next to Tom Jones yesterday.  I've never wanted to just look at a cock so badly. 
[03:23:30]  Oh, you should have.  Why didn't you?  I couldn't.  It was too obvious.  Dude, when are you going to get another chance to look at Tom Jones?  Tom Jones fucking monstrous hog.  Probably Thursday.  Yeah, Thursday.  He's got a date.  No, actually, in January, I'm going to see him when I'm in Atlantic City at the Borgata.  But you might not get the opportunity to see his hog.  That was, you were right next to him.  Why didn't you just peek?  Because I would have literally, because he didn't want to be from TV.  You could have peeked.  Just said, I got to see your hog.  Don't have made a joke about it.  Famous, that hog.  Just look over and go, hey.  He's probably got a big diamond ring on it. 
[03:24:00]  He's probably like, hey, I heard you have a big hog.  Oh, shit, you do.  And then just nudge him on the shoulder like you do.  I do.  I sure thought of that.  With his Welsh accent and his big dick.  Could have seen it.  How did the pee stream sound?  Did it sound like you had a big pee hole?  Sometimes you get like a resonance.  If it's a big dick, you'll hear like a piss sound.  What caliber was his piss hole?  Did it sound like a tinkle?  Like a tinkle, tinkle, tinkle?  No.  It sounded like fucking a fire hose.  Like he didn't want somebody attending a certain college in 1958. 
[03:24:30]  He dissolved a full urinal cake.  Drilled a hole right through it.  I hate when people put mothballs in urinals.  It smells like mothballs.  Why?  I don't like them.  No.  You just put ice in them in bars to keep the piss out of the traps.  But it's fun, too, because you get to melt the ice.  You make little ice tunnels with your piss.  You get a cup and fill it up and then chew on it.  You girls have no idea how much fun it is to piss in bars and stuff. 
[03:25:00]  If there's a cigarette butt in there, you try to actually get rid of all the tobacco and the paper.  And then the biggie is if you could then unroll the paper that's wrapped around the filter with your piss stream.  You knock the tobacco out.  That's just phase one.  Phase two is peeling the paper off of the cotton filter just with your piss stream.  And then you're like, I win.  So just the filter remains.  Just the filter's there.  And then you piss the shit out of the paper and try to dissolve that and get a hole in your dick. 
[03:25:30]  How big is your dick?  And then phase four is actually to put it all back together with your piss.  Yeah, actually piss the cigarette back together again.  Vinnie Brand has that in his truck.  He has a piss game.  Oh, that stupid thing in the urinal?  See if you can piss as much as Uncle Bo.  And you're supposed to pay a quarter and it measures your tinkle.  What?  Idiocy.  Leave it to him to try to make a quarter for pissing.  It probably all goes into a fucking hose in his office and he drinks it.  It goes to the beer taps. 
[03:26:00]  Fucking dopey.  The beer taps.  Exactly.  Can I have appeals?  All right.  We'll take a break and then we'll go to the pedo audio from different strokes.  Get those cocks out because Dudley's shirt's coming off.  Dudley is 57 already.  Be right back.  We'll be in the Anthony show. 
[03:26:30]  Back from break.  I was just chatting with Bobby.  Me and Bobby.  Chatting.  About the hair thing.  I think Bobby's going to at least go for a little consultation, right?  Uh, I'm going to go in and check it out because I, you know, I wouldn't mind having hair.  I used to have, you know, beautiful ringlets.  If they don't have what you want, why don't you just get a hat with a propeller nailed to  your head?  Nailed. 
[03:27:00]  Nailed.  A little dunce cap.  I wouldn't check it out.  Maybe.  But I'd have to grow my hair out.  Yeah, you gotta have like, uh, you gotta have, I think, uh, like a half inch of hair  for them to actually be able to assess how much hair you have and what they can do with  it and then to, to take that swath off the back.  I'm going to check that out.  You know who has a great, uh, hair transplant?  Uh, Pivens.  Jeremy Pivens.  Does he have one?  Yeah.  He's, he was bald.  When he was on Ellen, remember he was bald.  Oh, yeah?  Now he's got a fucking great piece. 
[03:27:30]  Is it, is it a hair piece?  No, it's, uh, it's, uh...  Did he have it done?  He had the follicles.  Who's Jeremy Pivens?  That guy.  Whoever that guy.  Jeremy Pivens.  Pivens.  Oh, no.  I thought the boss was here.  Jeremy Pigeons.  Hey, we're going to watch, let's listen to a different stroke.  Yeah, let's do it.  Yes, yes.  Jesus.  Let's get to it.  Well, this first clip is, um, Mr. Horton, who is the bike shop owner, Dudley and Arnold,  they're all hanging out at the bike shop and they start, uh, drinking wine. 
[03:28:00]  What a good job if you're a pedal.  Drinking wine?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  The bike shop?  The bike shop, sniffing their seats right when they ride in.  I got a great idea.  Why don't I be the lion?  And then you take...  Yeah, they're playing games, by the way.  I forgot this.  I forgot this.  Every movie and TV pedo always has a little game that they play that gets them into the  situation they need to be in.  And for some reason, I can't remember, but for some reason, Dudley was shirtless during  this whole thing.  Arnold was fully clothed, but Dudley was shirtless during this. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, whore.  You should play hide the eel in the cave.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Well, play kiss the eel like you give him a kiss and he spits on you.  Give the eel a kiss.  I creep.  Yeah, take your shite off.  Shitty shite.  Where is he from?  He doesn't call Paul.  Yeah, I'm from all over.  Paul Haugus.  I guess.  And the U is silent, by the way.  H-A-R-G-I. 
[03:29:00]  Silent U.  I got a great idea.  Why don't I be the lion?  And you take the pictures, Arnold, okay?  Okay by me.  You know how to operate that thing around?  Oh, yeah, sure.  We have one of these at home.  Only more expensive.  I guess I'm the first semi-bald king of the jungle.  All right, why don't you hop on my back here?  And I'll have, oh, Jim, I'm going to try and throw you there.  So basically, Mr. Horton is on all fours like, you know, like... 
[03:29:30]  Of course he is.  Like a lion.  And a shirtless Dudley is now on his back.  Of course he is.  Yeah.  Wow, what did you get on?  While Arnold is taking pictures of all things.  It's a great game.  Arnold's taking pictures.  I'm sorry I don't have a tail for you to hang on to.  That's okay.  You can just wag your behind.  Okay, here we go.  The old roar.  That's a lot of fun, isn't it, doesn't it?  Yeah.  Say, men, we're going to have to protect ourselves here in the jungle.  I mean, we don't want to be bitten by the terrible Titsi flying, now, do we, huh? 
[03:30:00]  Maybe we should have a little more wine.  No, thanks.  I'd rather get bitten on the Titsi.  Oh.  Well, I know my friend Dudley's not going to let me down, huh?  Sure, I'll have some more.  You going to be a chicken, Arnold?  Well, okay.  I'll have just one sip.  There you go.  I don't know.  Okay, fellas, here we go, huh?  What do they say?  School.  Bottoms up.  L'chaim. 
[03:30:30]  Bottoms up.  Literally.  Oh, he is quite a creep.  Yeah, to play the Lion King, he roars.  Oh, he's got a fucking boner.  Yeah, he does.  Oh, you know he's just got a boner.  He's fucking making little pre-cumsies into his older gentleman's slacks.  His twitching rod is moving his pubic fat.  He's pushing his pleats out on his dockers.  His fatty pubis is sweating with anticipation.  Oh, yeah.  A little Dudley.  Yeah, you know Dudley's little cultish legs are gripping his fat older man's sides, holding 
[03:31:00]  on to the lion.  You probably feel the sweat through fucking Mr. Horton's sweater shirt.  Of course.  He's sweating.  Of course he is.  Oh, just thinking about it.  Yeah.  Just rolls over and starts licking his cheek like a lion cub.  Yeah, you need some protection.  The wine will do it.  Well, this next clip is the one that you guys were talking about before where they start  watching the tape in the VCR.  Ah, nice. 
[03:31:30]  Okay, guys.  Here it is.  It's a showtime and a pie time.  Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.  It's time for Curly's Cartoon Cavalcade.  Oh, and away we go.  Man, I love cartoons.  Me too.  I bet you guys haven't seen Murphy the Mouse.  No.  No.  Murphy the Mouse goes in his asshole.  Check him out. 
[03:32:00]  Hey.  That mouse just lost his pants.  He's not wearing any undershorts.  Look at that girl mouse.  She's wearing a bikini.  Not anymore.  I've never seen a cartoon like this before.  Me neither.  Look who we've been missing.  Ah.  That little shirtless hussy.  Yeah.  Why is he putting a piece of cheese on his cock? 
[03:32:30]  That's Murphy the Mouse.  Oh, what a creep.  How does he get a piece of Dudley?  But they don't seem that horrified by it.  They're like, wow, neato.  No, they're kind of fine with this.  This shows the children to just buck up.  Well, they...  Take it, take it.  Suck up.  They teach you at the end.  That's when the big lesson comes about what to do and everything.  But we still have a couple more tracks.  Oh, thank God.  This next part is Arnold decides that he's too uncomfortable, so he's going to leave. 
[03:33:00]  But then this is when Mr. Horton suggests that perhaps he and Dudley play a game that  happens to take place in the bathroom.  Dudley, this is an X-rated cartoon.  It's dirty.  Yeah, I know.  Arnold, it's not dirty.  It's adult.  And we are all adults, aren't we?  We only look adult because we worry a lot. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, wait.  I want to see how that mouse looks out.  You know, I don't like this cartoon, but I have nothing against this pot.  Come on, Arnold, stick around.  No, Dudley, look, if Arnold wants to go, then that's what he should do.  I'm warning you, Dudley, if the Mouseketeers hear about this, you'll have to turn in your ears.  Listen, Dudley, don't worry about Arnold.  We can have a lot more fun without him.  After the cartoon's over, we'll play Neptune, King of the Sea. 
[03:34:00]  How do you play that?  Oh, you know, it takes a lot of water, the bath, the shower.  Oh, it's a great game.  You're going to love it.  It's a fun game.  How else are you going to play Neptune?  A bathtub, you know, the shower.  There's more.  I hope so.  Oh, yeah.  It's a great game.  I like to get a cock blocker left.  Yeah, really.  I think that old fucking stick in the mud went home to fucking give heroin to his sister so she can hang herself. 
[03:34:30]  Here you go.  Here's a handgun, older brother.  Rob a convenience store while my friend is getting finger popped by a fucking radio station program director.  What's our next scene?  Well, in the space between the clip that we just heard and the clip we're about to hear, Mr. Drummond gets wise to what's happening over at the bike shop.  No way.  How do you get wise to it? 
[03:35:00]  Because Dudley's father had smelt wine on his breath.  And when he was confronted about where he had the wine, he pointed, he said, oh, he got some at Mr. Drummond's house.  Oh, so he went to Drummond's house.  He was protecting Mr. Horton by saying Mr. Drummond's house.  And Mr. Drummond's like, I would never give him wise.  Exactly, right.  So then they called the police.  And then, just like in real life, you would head over there with the police to go investigate the situation.  So this is how that went down.  Dudley, are you okay?  Oh, Mr. Drummond, am I glad to see you. 
[03:35:30]  Boy, I sure feel goofy.  Did Mr. Horton give you anything, Dudley?  A pill.  He said it would make me feel good.  Dudley?  Are you all right?  Yeah, I guess so.  No, man.  I'm pretty fucking ball from all right.  Dudley.  Put your shirt on, you little fruit.  Stop gallivanting in the tub.  Your chores aren't done.  I want you to tell me exactly what happened before we came in.  Uh-oh. 
[03:36:00]  Do I have to?  Go ahead.  It's all right.  Now, Dudley, you can tell everything to Detective Simpson because he's here to help us.  Mr. Drummond's got his dick out.  You can tell me too, Dud.  Don't leave anything out.  He's fucking Dudley's father with those big dumb teeth.  Remember Dudley's buck-toothed father?  Too bad Mr. Horton wasn't a dentist.  He could have fucked the kid and fixed the dad's teeth.  Hey, Mr. Horton, could you put me in the basket of your bike and then drop me off at the fucking,  at the Tooth Fairy's office so I can get these fucking giant Hillary choppers fixed? 
[03:36:30]  I'll let you massage marmalade in my son's back for a little while if you'll fix my tuppuses.  Well, at first, Dad, I was having a lot of fun.  Yeah, I bet.  And Mr. Horton, he tried to, he tried to touch me.  It's not your fault, son.  Yes, it is.  I don't blame you.  It's God's fault for giving you a body that no one can resist. 
[03:37:00]  I'm not going to punish you.  I love you.  I love you, even though you're a fruit now.  That's what Mr. Horton said.  Yeah.  Yeah, I love you.  No, we'll go home and play Neptune, Dudley.  Yeah, you ever play Neptune?  But he seemed completely gay for it.  He loved the X-rated cartoon.  Yeah.  He's like, bring on the wine.  More wine, more fucking X-rated cartoons.  He's up for the playing Neptune and shit.  He was into Willis.  What's his name?  Arnold leaving?  Get the fuck out of here.  Arnold fucking hit the bricks.  Our anus.  Yeah.  You are never to blame. 
[03:37:30]  Arnold playing kick the can with his bad liver.  Our anus.  That's what was wrong with him, too, right?  He was like an adult, but small.  Yeah, he was a kidney problem.  Arnold was 36 during this episode.  She actually...  You are never to blame.  Does he get caught?  I completely forgot how this episode...  No, he went back to WKRP.  Is that it?  Yeah. 
[03:38:00]  Johnny Fever had better pictures of Dudley.  He changed his name to Mark Parenteau and worked at that station for a while.  Oh, shit.  Come on.  We all know.  He liked the Playstations and the young black boys.  Ooh.  Wow.  There's still one more, though.  Oh, yeah.  This is the part now, because obviously Mr. Horton's not being busted.  Oh, boy.  And the cop...  What are you doing?  Why don't you take a seat over there by the bicycle? 
[03:38:30]  And now we all get to be educated about molesters and, you know, what to look for and all that good stuff.  You know, some parents actually blame the children for what happened.  That is dreadful.  That is the worst thing you could do.  What's going to happen to Mr. Horton?  Well, I think we got a darn good case against him, Willis.  Thanks to your father calling us, we were able to surprise him, and we found some very incriminating pictures.  That old faye ain't my father.  Worse than the mice?  Much worse.  What is this world coming to? 
[03:39:00]  The detective Simpson said it was a good thing we called him, because if I'd gone down and  confronted Horton by myself, he would have been able to get rid of all the photographs  before the police could even get there.  Unfortunately, most parents do just that, and the guy gets off scot-free.  I just can't get over this.  We've known Mr. Horton for a year.  He seemed like such a nice man.  Now, that's the contradiction with child molest.  That's the contradiction.  She's fucking taking a pill.  Of course they're nice, you idiot. 
[03:39:30]  They're trying to get into a kid's pants.  They have to be nice.  You can't be an asshole pedophile.  Yeah.  Here's Mr. Horton.  Try the wine.  I'm pleased you appreciate good wine.  Did Mr. Drummond ring the bell at Mr. Horton's house?  Please.  Try the wine.  Mr. Horton rules.  Ha ha, Mr. Horton. 
[03:40:00]  Mr. Horton, police.  Gotta come out here.  No.  My health doesn't allow me.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, Dudley's nipples.  Try the wine.  By the way, I think at this point, Dudley's still shirtless.  He's been shirtless the entire episode.  I love the fact that Mr. Horton gave him wine and a pill.  Right, yeah.  How much coaching does this kid need?  Hand him into television.  It's like 1981.  Get his shirt off before he even entered the bike shop. 
[03:40:30]  Yeah.  It's just hot out.  Fucking kid thinks he's Tracy Morgan.  Ha ha ha.  You know, that's the contradiction with child molesters.  Yeah.  In their own strange way, they actually love children.  The majority of them would never intentionally harm a child.  Oh, that's nice.  The sad part is they can emotionally scar a child for life.  Man.  I never would have guessed that Mr. Horton was, you know, gay.  Well, he's not, Willis.  You know, that's the common fallacy about child molesters. 
[03:41:00]  They're not gay.  They're only interested in little boys or little girls, not adults.  Wait a second.  So, if you suck a little boy dick, you're not gay?  Not gay.  I didn't know that.  Apparently not.  That's what Mr. Drummond says.  So, you're not gay.  It depends on the size of the cock.  Is this Mr. Drummond talking about that?  I think this is the police detective.  This is clear up all misconceptions with the audience.  Exactly.  This is, don't go out and beat up homosexuals because they're not doing this.  I didn't know he was gay. 
[03:41:30]  You know, gay.  Well, he's not gay.  The penis didn't have hair on it.  Yeah.  See, that's what makes gayness.  Is hair on the balls and dick.  There's nothing gay about running a young, hairless penis under your gums like it's a pinch of skull.  As long as that scrotum looks like a nice tight clamshell.  Jesus.  Mr. Fucking Horton really shook things up, didn't he?  Yeah, he sure did.  What happened to his bike shop?  Close down.  I know. 
[03:42:00]  Same big boarded up thing.  Yeah, close renovations.  Is there more of this?  No, that's a...  Wasn't Mr. Carlson talk at the end?  No, that was the end of the episode.  Oh.  Wow.  So as long as the dick looks like an outie belly button, you can suck it without me.  Right, and you're fine.  Okay, good.  I think they're saying that pedophiles a lot of times target boys and girls that don't care.  A little Cocktail Frank.  Dipped in.  And you're fine.  It's just awful. 
[03:42:30]  Ketchup.  How awful.  That's what was so annoying about those shows, is you sort of like, you know, you liked it  was your favorite sitcom or whatever, you liked to laugh, and then all of a sudden they'd  throw you for a loop in some kind of, like, preachy, serious thing.  Yeah, the first season of a lot of these shows did make people laugh, and then after  that they had to go, all right, let's bring in a little serious drama to this.  Well, all the family used to do that.  And it actually just pulled it off.  But that was socially...  Maybe that's why they probably started doing that shit, because shows like that came out. 
[03:43:00]  Well, yeah, it's all in the family.  It was probably embarrassing to do the garbage the sitcoms are doing after you looked at what  that show did.  Yeah.  But they all tried to do it.  They all had the special episodes.  The worst were Good Times, because that was just horrible special episodes.  Every single one was just...  James, what are we going to do about JJ?  There's JJ, you know, drinking, getting all drunk.  He comes in.  You look like Thelma with that thing on your head.  Yeah, I got the Thelma look with my chapeau. 
[03:43:30]  That's funny.  Fucking Janet Jackson walks in wearing Walona's iron as a hat.  Yeah.  Still plugged in.  She was abused, and that's why she's living with Walona.  Yeah.  Because she was an abused child.  She's coming with a big black eye.  Yeah.  Right.  And then Buffalo butts deep-dicking her.  Right.  Dumpster.  Buffalo.  Give another old deep-dicking.  I'm the superintendent.  Yeah.  Oh, fuck her.  Oh, yeah.  Bookman.  Bookman, yeah. 
[03:44:00]  What about Gay Michael?  And then the husband died.  Then she remarried a guy, and then they had to move to Arizona because he wound up getting  lung cancer, and they needed a dry climate.  So they moved to Arizona, and that's how they got off the show.  And then it was just the kids.  Do you know why that happened?  Do you know why that happened?  There was actually this big to-do where the actors thought that J.J. was getting all of  the screen time, and how he was becoming a little bit too much like this sort of black 
[03:44:30]  whoo-hoo, you know?  Step and fetch it.  Step and fetch guy.  And they wanted, the actors wanted a lot more social messages about the black community.  Yeah.  So they went on this sort of strike, and the show was off for a little bit, and then it  was back on, and I guess the father never returned.  Yeah, they got rid of-  From Lear, it was, right?  Yeah.  Figures that he would, you know, I mean, I think he, whatever, he's kind of an annoying  liberal.  They got rid of John Amos.  He left, I'm sure.  Yeah, he left.  He was the best actor there. 
[03:45:00]  My mother was actually a good actress.  She was great.  Respectable actress.  That big fucking inner tube around her neck.  Fat neck.  Was that a three-bedroom projects?  Did they even have those?  Do those exist?  Three-bedroom projects?  I think it was.  Really?  Three-bedroom, right?  Yeah, J.J. and, no, no, no, J.J. and the other, Michael slept out on the pullout sofa.  Oh, they both, so it was a two-bedroom, yeah.  Remember?  It was a two-bedroom, and then the parents, and then Walona, or what's her name? 
[03:45:30]  Walona.  No.  Thelma.  The Thelma had her own room.  Didn't J.J. get engaged, and the chick was on heroin and jumped out the window or something?  Yeah, yeah, there was something.  Every chick that J.J. got involved with was either stealing-  Junkie.  Or a junkie, or a drunk.  There was always a problem with her.  Did she die?  Oh, she did something, yeah.  And you see Thelma, they actually hit, she was in Hustler, I think.  Yeah, yeah, years ago.  And she's just fucking smoking her naked.  Was she?  Yeah, it's on the internet.  Pull her nude pictures of Thelma up.  Yeah, I'd love to see her naked, but what a body she has.  Except for that mole on the side of her head. 
[03:46:00]  Who cared?  Oh, I hate anything.  That had to be shot off.  Oh, it's gross.  Fuck, remember J.J. got shot by Mad Dog?  Kissing her.  Mad Dog shot him.  Hey, Mikey.  Somebody got shot?  That was what J.J. said.  Yeah.  J.J.  The father, it was a two-part episode.  Of course it was.  And then fucking, the father in his awful coat, wanted to fucking, uh...  Wanted to kill him?  Oh, yeah.  I like when they went to, um, uh, he was supposed to get some job, uh, James.  He was, been out of work, he got laid off, and he went for an interview, and, uh, it looked 
[03:46:30]  like a shoo-in to get the job, so they took all the rent money that they had and threw  a big party.  Talk about being, uh, uh, you know, N-word rich.  They, they took the rent money and everything that they had together.  They could barely pay the bills.  They couldn't even pay all the bills.  But they took all that money, because James had a new job with a big raise.  We're getting out of the projects, uh, Florida!  Maybe you'd get out of...  James!  Maybe you'd get out of the projects if you didn't spend the rent money on shit, stupid. 
[03:47:00]  So they threw this big party, and then, uh, James comes home and says he didn't get  the job.  And they blew all the money, so.  I think every white person watching has said, uh, stupid fucking, you know, and then...  I don't know, I might beep up.  I, uh, I will say, though, it was a great theme song.  Yeah, well, very memorable.  Good artwork, too.  Keeping your head above water.  An interesting fact is, Janet Dubois, who sang, who was Walona, also sang the theme song 
[03:47:30]  from the Jeffersons.  No, she did.  She most certainly did.  And my grandmother used to hate when I would talk over the theme song from the Jeffersons,  because she liked it.  And she would go, once a week I get to see this program, and you have to talk over the  song.  You are a fucking scumbag!  That's great, though!  She hated it!  Good for you!  She hated it!  Fuck that!  Exactly.  You irrelevant old lady, be quiet.  We're moving on up! 
[03:48:00]  She liked it.  There's a happy song in it.  Yeah.  And what would you say?  Hey, Grandma!  I wouldn't just talk.  I wouldn't just shut up.  It's like, shut up!  I'm listening to this.  Sorry, stupid.  Jimmy!  I'm listening to this.  I like this song.  I get once a week to watch this program and hear the music.  Let me listen.  Stop tapping your privileged white feet together.  Take out a piece of the pie.  Shh!  I like this part.  She used to love this part.  Not when little Jimmy was watching it, she didn't.  Took off. 
[03:48:30]  Yip and yap right through it.  It wouldn't shut up.  I would.  There's a fucking...  Until the fucking song was over.  Then I was at church bouse.  Silent as a fucking tool.  And here it comes back.  Moving on out.  She's sitting there with her dumb Afghans in a fight.  Criticizing where her teeth clicked when she shoots.  Wasn't this the...  Fucking Afghans.  Wasn't this the final song that was played at Oak Ridge Wedding?  The gospel singers up top.  Can't find any nude pictures of her. 
[03:49:00]  I don't think she ever did pose.  She did.  No.  I've seen it.  I think she did.  She did.  I don't know if it was Hustler or Penthouse maybe.  Probably Penthouse.  Probably Penthouse.  I doubt it was Hustler because it was such a vulgar magazine.  Yeah.  It was probably Penthouse.  I remember Hustler had a...  I know it was a playboy.  Hustler had a scratch and sniff once.  I remember that.  And this was when I was probably nine, nine years old and I was hanging out with my friend  Roy and he said, check this out.  So he looked and then he scratched and sniffed it and he goes, oh, wow, check this out. 
[03:49:30]  And he said, you scratch it and smell it.  I was like, no, I didn't want to smell it.  What an asshole.  No, it was a pussy.  I got it.  The asshole would have smelled like mushroom.  But I didn't want it and I never did.  They would smell like a pussy.  They were terrible.  Was it a pussy?  No, it's supposed to smell like a pussy.  It didn't though.  How do you know?  Because I've scratched them all.  Scratch holes in them?  Yeah.  Fuck them?  Smells like the desk when you eat the magazine. 
[03:50:00]  Smells like my thigh and jeans.  Ouch.  Yeah, I was scared that it was going to smell really bad and I was going to be turned off  a pussy for life.  What a dork.  I was only nine.  I know.  I don't want to smell that fucking nasty hustler scratch and stiff, hairy pussy.  You're Arnold and Roy is Dudley.  Roy's a goer.  The goer.  I was a cock blocker.  Dudley was a stiff-nippled goer.  Stupid Dudley.  Here's something interesting I found. 
[03:50:30]  If you go to Google and just type in Bernadette Stannis, who was the actress, and just put  nude, the first result that you will get is from Whackbag, a Whackbag discussion on  whether or not she was ever nude in Playboy.  That figures.  Well, we did do a bit on that years ago.  We did talk about that, and that's when Opie said Florida.  He jerked off to Florida nude in Penthouse. 
[03:51:00]  According to...  And I quickly said it was the other one.  According to Hogs Big Ben, he's looked all over the place but never found these Playboy  pics.  I don't think they exist.  He says, Roseanne Caton is probably who he was talking about.  She was September 78.  Blah, blah, blah.  Didn't the little girl there from Archie Bunker's Place, didn't she pose naked?  No.  The little Jewish girl?  It was Jean Stapleton.  No.  She opened her asshole for a jug center fold. 
[03:51:30]  A little gaping.  Yeah, she was doing some gaping.  Oh, jeez, you're gaping there.  She did a scene with fucking Buttersmith.  Your pussy smells like a radiator, ain't it?  Really dice?  I'm not the guy who does the impressions.  Bobby Dice Bunker.  She did.  Yeah, you can't find her?  She never did.  Du Bois.  No, Janet Du Bois was Wallona.  I forget Bernadette's... 
[03:52:00]  What's her name?  Stannis.  Stannis.  Stannis was...  I don't know.  The little girl there from Archie Bunker's Place had some kind of French stupid name.  Did Tina Yothers ever pose naked?  Tina Yothers.  Every child star is like, what are you doing now?  Well, I have a rock band together.  Loser.  Nothing going on.  Remember Meredith Baxter Burney fired out another kid?  Andy, the little baby?  Oh, yeah.  And then they aged the kid, didn't they?  Yeah, he was 37 the next year. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, he was awful.  It was a baby, and then they were like, well, baby isn't going to get the ratings up fast enough.  So just in one season, off, they aged the kid until he was like six or something.  Yeah, it was horrible.  They always did that when she was in trouble.  Like, oh, let's bring a kid to come hang out.  Yeah, Oliver, they did it with him.  On the Brady Bunch.  And the Partridge family, they did it with that little kid with the bowl haircut.  And he sang some fucking little kiddie song, and he was on every week. 
[03:53:00]  Like, that was when the Partridge family started going down the shitter.  Once, uh...  Maybe when it started going down the shitter.  How about episode one?  I don't know.  Fucking horrible.  Once, uh, Susan Day got her braces off, it was all over.  Yeah, that's true.  Ruben Kincaid had them booked at a Latin Kings party, and they get the shit beat out of them.  Fucking, he stunk, Ruben Kincaid.  They actually had a serious episode where they were playing for black people.  Really?  Yeah, and Keith Partridge said something like, they wrote a song, and he goes, 
[03:53:30]  I think I can make an Afro version of this song.  An Afro version.  And they did, and they made like a funky Partridge family song that just sucked an ass.  It was so bad.  Of course it did.  Oh, my father or mother got me Shirley Jones's autograph.  No way.  I have Shirley Jones's autograph.  Ugh.  Cares. 
[03:54:00]  Wipe your ass with it.  Fuck that old gun.  I think it's what she wrote in quotes.  I got an autograph from a guy, Robert, I forget his name, he was one of the original, uh...  Kelly?  Yes.  He spelled it R-O-B-B.  I'm like, that's wrong, idiots.  Uh, it was Robert Hodges.  He was the, uh, one of the, I think it's Hedges or Hodges, one of the original O.J. prosecutors.  Oh, really?  Who had to drop out because of heart trouble.  Robert Hedges was, um, uh...  Oh, sorry, I didn't see you.  Welcome back, Cotter.  Welcome back, Cotter.  Uh, this was whatever the guy's name was. 
[03:54:30]  What is that?  Bill Hodgman.  This is Danielle Brizbo.  Oh, that is her.  That's, uh...  That's, uh, a little girl there, huh?  Oh.  The one in the lead.  I thought she had a...  Why is she wearing sumo wrestler underpants?  I know, those panties are horrid.  Awful.  Wait a minute, the one at the end of the show with the black hair?  Yes.  That's her?  Yes.  Which one is her?  Isabel Sanford.  No, the one in the back.  Oh, the one in the back?  The one with the droopy tits?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which one?  High underwear or droop tits? 
[03:55:00]  It's fucking awful, this photo.  These two mediocre women running by rocks.  What is this from, a movie?  With fucking Playtex girdle underwear on.  It's part thong, part fucking, part, uh, uh, fucking, I can't think of it.  What, what's, what's, what's in here?  It's part...  Hold on.  Uh, I am a no-talent for...  Oh, you stink.  It's so big.  Oh, part thong, part hazmat suit.  That's funny. 
[03:55:30]  Because of the unsexiness of a hazmat suit.  It's just so big, too.  Starts at her chin, and it thongs up by her tits, and it comes out of her ankles.  It's great.  We're in Fred Mertz pants.  Are you a hooker, or are you handing a fucking, a diseased monkey?  I can't tell.  Doc Brown was wearing that when he was putting that.  When he was putting the plutonium in the DeLorean.  Well, yeah, that's her, huh?  Yeah.  I knew I saw her naked somewhere.  That, uh, Mr. Skin site. 
[03:56:00]  That's her good one.  What is it?  It's just celebrities naked.  It's like you pop in their name in the search, and, uh, it pops naked pictures.  Put in, uh, Dakota Fanning.  She's a cheerleader.  Dude, what?  Well, I think this game got played once, and, like, on, I think it's her official website.  Oh, yeah, there are some, there are some, uh, bare, almost inappropriate pictures of her  on her, her website.  Who, Dakota Fanning?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like her in a little cheerleader uniform. 
[03:56:30]  Her sitting provocatively on a bed in underwear.  Um, yeah, see, like, there's some, a few, oh, fine.  She's fucking seven.  No, she's 14 now.  Oh.  Which means, uh, in no time at all, she'll be, uh, perfect.  Yeah, she's.  And the videos of her suck, and the rapper's cock.  Oh, God, please, just stay white.  Stay pure.  Pure.  What's sexy about that?  What?  If I see a young actress, like, Hilary Duff, I wouldn't want to watch her blow on a white 
[03:57:00]  guy.  Who cares?  Some lame fucking, what, Keith Urban?  The fuck?  No way.  No, me.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Like, I'm not thinking of her blowing anybody else.  What do you think?  Oh, I'm thinking of her blowing this guy, or.  Not at all.  I want to see, like, Anthony Edwards fucking her face.  Young Hilary Duff with Anthony Edwards in a fucking trailer.  Goose Anthony Edwards, or, uh, ER Anthony Edwards?  The, uh, the black actor, who got in trouble for assaulting that chick in his trailer, allegedly. 
[03:57:30]  I thought you meant, uh, Anthony Edwards.  No, no, no, not the black guy.  Oh, okay.  He was in, he's in a lot of shit.  Aren't they both named Anthony Edwards?  I don't know.  I'm eating almonds.  Yes, I see that.  Oh, well.  All right.  Well, uh, I guess we'll give up looking for provocative pictures of Dakota fans.  No!  At least at work.  Oh, God.  Maybe we'll do it.  We'll just do that at home.  Yeah.  Uh, what are we doing?  I want to do it from this IP address. 
[03:58:00]  Yes!  Yes!  Are we doing, uh, what did we learn?  Yeah.  Or are we doing line of the day?  Um, probably what did we learn, because I don't know if we have any lines to, uh.  Well, I'm sure there were very funny lines today, but we're short-staffed.  We're short-staffed.  I think everything will go back to normal, hopefully, tomorrow.  What did we learn kind of runs itself, because it's run by the listeners who learn things.  So, um, please call us with things you've learned today.  And in the meantime...  866-969-1969. 
[03:58:30]  866-WOW1-WOW.  I should mention that this Saturday, uh, the Laszlo show.  Oh!  Right here on this, uh, channel.  Oh, good.  9 p.m. Eastern.  Live, Laszlo.  Not, not something pre-taped, because we all know how people hate to hear new material  that isn't happening as they're listening to it.  Wow, what's the anger, bro?  For some reason.  What's wrong with you?  All right, bud.  You all right, then?  This Friday, I will be at the State Theater in fucking, uh, Virginia.  Doing two shows.  Jesus. 
[03:59:00]  This, uh, the following weekend, I'll be in Los Angeles.  The 12th, 13th, whatever it is.  I'm gonna miss you.  Where?  Uh, Viper Room.  Oh.  And then, uh, January 16th, 17th, whatever it is, I'll be at the Bogota.  Those are all my plugs.  That's great.  Where are you gonna be, Bobbo?  Uh, Thursday, starting Thursday night, I'm gonna be in, uh, at Marco Island in Florida.  That's in Florida.  Near Naples or, uh, Fort Myers. 
[03:59:30]  I'm gonna be there, uh, I'm gonna be there all fucking week, apparently.  Bob's gonna be on the business end of a glory hole in Key West.  What's the name of the jerk?  No, it's in Naples.  I've already looked it up.  Um, Off the Hook Comedy Club.  Off the Hook.  Dot com.  Off the hook.  Off the fucking hook, Comedy Club.  I heard this, uh, is a hot spot, and I'm gonna be there.  Cool.  So, all right.  I'm waiting for tickets.  Um, let's see, where's my little, uh, plugster, plugster-rooney? 
[04:00:00]  Hey, What Did We Learn is brought to you by Step Brothers, now available on DVD, Blu-ray,  high def, and PSP.  Step Brothers stars Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly.  It is rated R for crude and sexual content and pervasive language.  Ooh.  Available in both theatrical and unrated versions.  It's Step Brothers.  Yes.  Yes, it is.  And that brings us, What Did We Learn?  Yes, it does.  Let's go. 
[04:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, to the song.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  What did we learn?  What did we learn?  Uh, lady trucker, lady trucker, what did you learn today?  I've been learning how to use a phone.  Lady trucker.  Good morning, fellas. 
[04:01:00]  Hi.  I've learned that in a couple years we'll get a, uh, the cameo.  Dakota Fanning will almost be old enough for Anthony.  Ooh.  All right.  A couple of years.  14, 15, 16, 17, 18.  We've got four years left.  Four years to go.  Yeah.  Which will be all right.  All right.  So, Scott.  We're, uh, looking for Scott.  Scott.  Hey, boys.  Bob Kelly, you rule.  Hey, uh, I learned that, uh, child molesters aren't gay. 
[04:01:30]  Well, we did learn that.  Right.  From a, uh, police, policeman back on a stupid old sitcom.  Thank you.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Almost missed it.  Remember we weren't going to do What Did We Learn anymore?  We were just going to do, uh, Line of the Day, and it was because of this very reason.  It's just a pain in the ass.  Uh, Jeff in, uh, North Carolina.  Did he, uh, teach, uh, did we teach him anything today? 
[04:02:00]  Jeff?  Jeff?  Hello.  Hi, sir.  Hey, I learned that it's not gay if there's no hair.  Not, right.  Not gay if there's no hair.  According to that cop, that's pretty much it.  It's not gay, no hair.  Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you.  Learned a lot.  It's like college, this show.  No bones on the, uh, instant feedback.  He learned that it's not gay to eat your own cum, but it's bad if you chew it.  I think somebody said that. 
[04:02:30]  That's true.  Bobby.  I said eat it, and Bob said chew it.  Uh, that's wonderful.  All right.  I, I really don't think, uh, that people learned a lot.  Why?  These are gems flying in.  I think we had some good lines.  Yeah.  But, uh, well, we got three there that I'd rather not read.  Yeah, I was gonna say.  That'd be a bit of a problem.  You may not, you may not get to those.  Bobby learned what a, a mimeograph machine is.  Uh, ditto.  Ditto?  Did you know what a ditto is?  You ever seen a ditto?  You know what a ditto is?  D-I-T-T-O is ditto.  D-I-T-T-O. 
[04:03:00]  Just stop saying it.  Ditto.  Ditto.  It's a ditto.  I hate that word.  That's why people go ditto, because it's a copy of something.  I fucking want to.  Ditto.  What did you think people were saying when they went ditto?  I want to hit you in the face.  But what did you think they were saying?  And ditto it.  You didn't like the smell?  I don't know what ditto.  Like, didn't you think.  Ditto.  Because people said, yeah, ditto.  Ditto that.  What did you think they were, they meant by it?  Yeah.  If you didn't know what ditto was.  Do you want to go back into the fucking history of everything somebody says?  Well, you've got to know the origin of something.  Was there a hello machine one point?  I don't fucking know. 
[04:03:30]  Was there an asshole?  No.  What is the saying?  I think the hello machine is a phone.  I saw.  Will you hate?  I saw a hello machine.  Bobby, will you hate ditto when it's written in emails people send you?  Like, if they send you a MySpace and it says, hey, open this, and you open it and it  just says D-I-T-T-O.  Ditto.  Because you'll think of the word ditto.  No.  Cool.  No, I don't care about that.  Being a copy of something.  Ditto.  A ditto.  Did you not think that when someone said, yeah, ditto, that they meant, I feel the same 
[04:04:00]  way, all right?  I knew what it meant.  I knew what it meant.  But you didn't know what a ditto was?  I saw a fucking, that movie that had it in it that I can't think of right now.  Did you like the song that Ditto sang that Eminem put into his song?  Ditto.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Literal Bob.  I've never, I've never even fucking seen a ditto machine.  Now, you know, I've never, well, the machine was always in the faculty room, so we never 
[04:04:30]  really saw it.  We just saw the dittos.  The faculty room.  Faculty.  Faculty.  Faculty.  Faculty.  That's where the faculty stays.  The faculty room had a ditto machine.  Yes.  Ditto.  Yeah.  And you'd pour some ink and fluids into it.  Fucking hate the word ditto.  And then it would be this blue thing, and it would wrap around a drum, a chrome-like drum.  But how would you, and it would spin, it would go, and out of the machine would come dittos,  which were just a ditto of the original, a copy, if you will. 
[04:05:00]  The way you say ditto.  Just say ditto.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Shut up.  It's a ditto.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Didn't you hate when Rush Limbaugh would call them ditto heads?  Ditto heads.  His people were ditto heads.  Because they all thought the same.  I hate them.  Ditto.  Ditto.  I hate it.  Ditto.  Do you prefer ditto or ditto?  It's almost.  Ditto.  It's almost like you're aggravating birds.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Yeah, dodo. 
[04:05:30]  Let's see.  Oh, look.  We got something from Matt.  Hey, it's Aunt Jemima.  Illinois.  Aunt Jemima.  Shit.  Why did that take all shit off?  Jesus Christ.  That was a great one.  Aunt Jemima.  Aunt Jemima.  Yeah.  With my bandana.  Hey, Matt.  What's up, man?  Hey.  What did you learn on this fine day?  I learned that rolling a bowling ball into an open cut is a great idea. 
[04:06:00]  Yes.  Sure is.  If you don't mind losing the ball.  How about footer?  And, of course, footer.  Yeah.  Footer?  Yo.  Good evening.  What did you learn there?  I learned that bringing back, what did we learn?  Not so good.  Not so good.  Yeah.  Ditto.  Yeah, right.  Ditto.  All right, boys.  Have a good one.  Why is fucking Green Mile sitting out there on the bleachers? 
[04:06:30]  He doesn't look like John Coffey.  Jesus Christ.  John Coffey.  Not, what is it?  Like the drink, but not spelled the same.  That's right.  Like the drink, but with dead kids on the lap.  Oh!  John Coffey.  It's a fucking prop Joe out there.  Prop Joe is good.  There, there.  Have you watched any more Wire?  No.  Why?  I don't know.  I've had other things to watch.  There's nothing else to watch. 
[04:07:00]  You like it, right?  I can't now.  Yes, I love The Wire.  How great is it?  It's still on season one.  I'm saving season five, because I don't want it to end.  Season five.  It's like leveling up in a game now.  Like, I'm on season one.  I still gotta go and kill some rats.  And then bring in some gnoll teeth.  Fucking rats.  Bring some gnoll teeth to the guard.  Speaking of, Grand Theft Auto 4 came out on the PC today.  Yes.  In stores.  Or on Amazon.com.  That's the way to play it.  I can't wait to play this on PC. 
[04:07:30]  Oh, it's gonna work great.  Also, it's the number one game in Japan.  Grand Theft Auto 4.  Oh, hey.  Released it, like, a few weeks ago.  Nice.  Why so much later than, uh...  I don't know.  Because they're fucking Japanese.  Japan's a really weird market.  One of our guys over there got thrown out of the hotel pool because he's got tattoos.  No.  Dude, it is a bizarro culture.  It's illegal to be loud in public when you get off the plane.  There's all these rules they gave us.  It's illegal to be loud in public out there.  And you can't, uh... 
[04:08:00]  You can't litter at all.  Yeah.  At all.  Singapore's like that, too.  No littering.  Oh, they'll smack you with a stick.  We were on the little bus going from the plane, and we were talking, like, dude, I'm hungry.  And the lady was like, shh.  You can't talk loud in public.  I thought you were Godzilla.  And then I farted.  Oh, Mothra's talking.  What does he want?  Tread stupid.  Gamera's next.  Dumbara.  Why he babbled?  Making no sense. 
[04:08:30]  Joking, not funny.  So stupid.  I know.  Yeah, ditto.  I hate that word.  Even in fucking a Japanese accent.  Yeah.  They throw you out for tattoos?  Yeah.  It's a very, very weird culture.  That is odd.  You can't be in the pool with tattoos on.  Wow.  There's a lot of restaurants and bars won't serve you.  But they like their fucking kiddie porn under the guise of fucking anime.  Oh, I'm really into comic books.  Oh, that's interesting.  There's a bunch of underage girls getting loads blown on their faces.  Little fucking schoolgirl dresses and those bright eyes. 
[04:09:00]  Clothes with big wads.  I gotta go because I'm going to shit my pants.  All right.  I had fucking almonds and fucking almonds and grapefruit, which together, it's like the  type of dump.  It's like fucking dry fish should be molding it in Close Encounters.  It's like a big mashed potatoes dump, but brown.  I know this.  Yeah, it's going to reek.  I'm going to go drop Devil's fucking mountain. 
[04:09:30]  Devil's Tower.  Devil's Tower.  Whatever the fuck it is.  Devil's Logs.  All right.  It's going to be a fucking six.  It's going to be a six wiper.  You know how you shit and it's shit so awful when you wipe, it actually glides through like  you're sliding on ice and it's just light brown.  It's a light brown.  You know, you got your work cut out for you.  You haven't even hit the surface.  It's like you just dipped a tissue into a fucking brand new paint can.  I got a long way to go.  Fucking got onto your nails by the time you're finished. 
[04:10:00]  Fucking shoe polish.  Yes.  Oh, well, all right.  You go shit.  Yeah.  Laszlo, thank you so much for coming in.  Thank you.  Of course, Robert Kelly.  Thank you, too.  Very fun, man.  Very, you know.  Thank you.  Got to kind of bolster the program when one of our own is absent.  And Opie will be back tomorrow.  Had his honeymoon.  And I'm sure we'll get some honeymoony stories.  Danny.  Yes.  Thank you for taking the helm like that. 
[04:10:30]  Working the buttons.  Because I don't do that shit.  No.  I don't fuck with buttons.  I don't like the buttons.  I don't like those buttons.  And, of course, you, our audience.  The listener.  Thank you so much.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Have a good night. </pre>
