<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts mocking "Book Radio," transitioning into a discussion about intimidatingly large books, particularly Stephen King novels, and culminating in a critique of a photoshopped publicity photo of themselves.  This segued into a discussion of a video showing guest Jimmy being choked out by Gina Carano, followed by a crude and offensive critique of American Idol contestants and past seasons.  News stories were then covered, including allegations against Bruce Springsteen, a Pinkberry co-founder assaulting a homeless man, and Captain Schettino's cowardly abandonment of the Costa Concordia,  with a verbatim reading of his expletive-laden Coast Guard call. SOPA legislation was briefly discussed, alongside the hostsâ€™ past tactics for securing days off.  A long digression into 80s music, focusing on "Der Kommissar," and the difficulties in finding the German version online due to Google's SOPA blackout ensued before returning to banter about their comedic style and lack of preparation.

The show continued with Opie's comedic imitation of two incompetent Italian maritime officers, Shatino and DeFalco, during a ship evacuation.  Ant's eyesight problems and subsequent struggles reading the script led to a discussion about reading glasses and phone screen sizes, with Ant adjusting his text message font size live on air.  Scheduling conflicts and tension with producer Roland arose due to miscommunication regarding guests Tom Papa and Jim Brewer, involving complaints about company email policies and phone ownership rules, and speculation about Tom Papa's potential anger.  A news story about a boss secretly videotaping female employees was discussed, leading to tangents on the Real Housewives franchise, Kim Richards, and a clip from *Long Island Hoarders*.  A brief in-studio interview with Marion Barry followed, where he defended himself against accusations of being set up in his drug-related arrest.  The show concluded this segment with criticism of the predictable "Sex Man" segment and brainstorming ideas to improve it, alongside a discussion of best man speeches, culminating in playing a sample bad speech and discussing the anxieties surrounding such speeches.

The next segment focused on a contest for the worst best man/maid of honor speeches, with several graphic examples played on air, including references to oral sex and childhood sexual abuse. Jim Brewer then recounted a highly improbable story about his 89-year-old father's sexually aggressive behavior while suffering from dementia and congestive heart failure, culminating in self-induced near-fatal health episode through masturbation.  Brewer also shared an anecdote about a bizarre encounter with Zakk Wylde.  A comedic bit featuring "Derek the Dodo" promoting gun safety was included, followed by Brewer promoting his upcoming appearances at Levity Live. Uncle Paul then appeared, recounting sexually suggestive anecdotes from Opie's childhood.  The segment concluded with a discussion about the hosts' failing eyesight and the announcement of Opie's Shorty Award nomination.

The following segment discussed Opie and Anthony's Shorty Award nominations (for separate projects, not the radio show), focusing on Jim Brewer's comedic webisodes and videos,  with some clips deemed unsuitable for broadcast.  An update on the "Pizza Man" situation was given, followed by jokes and anecdotes about Brewer's family, including a family member's online dating experience.  The conversation then shifted to children and technology, including a critical and offensive commentary on children's television shows like *Little Bear*, *Yo Gabba Gabba*, *Blue's Clues*, and *Barney*, contrasted with reminiscing about classic Warner Brothers cartoons. The segment concluded with further discussion of the Shorty Awards, with Anthony lamenting his low ranking against Zack Ryder.


The final segment centered on Anthony's Shorty Award campaign against Zack Ryder, urging listeners to vote at ShortyAwards.com.  This segment was punctuated by frequent profanity, crude humor, and racist remarks.  A lengthy, satirical commercial for Steven Singer Jewelers (IHateStevenSinger.com, 1-888-IHATE-STEVEN-SINGER) aired.  Jim Brewer appeared in-studio, providing updates on Dane Cook. Opie's YouTube videos, including one featuring Gina Carano choking Jim Norton, were discussed, followed by sexually suggestive banter. DJ Who Kid joined, discussing his DJ career, lack of integrity, and experiences with 50 Cent, including stealing music.  DJ Troy Kwan then appeared, contrasting his approach to DJing with Who Kid's.  An upcoming Bobo and Troy production was discussed, along with announcements of upcoming guests: Tom Papa, Jerry Springer, Vinny from Jersey Shore, Ewan McGregor, and Mark Cuban.  A humorous anecdote about producer Roland's taco retrieval concluded the show, alongside a discussion of Paula Deen's lifestyle compared to Anthony Bourdain.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opian Anthony Channel, XM 105, Sirius 206.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What planet are we living on?  It's the Opian Anthony Show with Opian.  We're experts, and we already know this is going to be great radio, so shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony...  I live in a big house, I make a lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening. It sounds like a little...  What?  You get dang over here, don't listen to dang over here.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons? I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Book Radio. 
[00:01:00]  I didn't forget.  I was listening to a little of that on my way in from yesterday.  Yeah.  Book Radio.  Stupid Book Radio.  Welcome to Book Radio.  Good morning, everybody.  Book Radio.  Book Radio.  Book Radio.  Book Radio.  Book Radio.  Oh, I thought you were doing that live.  That was me from yesterday.  That's fucked up.  That was one of my outbursts from yesterday.  Book Radio.  Book Radio.  Book Radio.  I was looking down here, and I thought you said that live, so I decided to go with it, 
[00:01:30]  have a little chemistry with you, but now I'm just fucking having chemistry with the recording.  With a tape?  I would, um...  If I was Book Radio, though, what I would do is make that a promo.  It'd be like, like, hey, I'm Anthony Cumia, and every day I listen to...  Book Radio.  Book Radio.  Book Radio.  Book Radio.  Book Radio.  Book Radio.  Hey, Anthony Cumia, what's your favorite station?  Book Radio.  See? 
[00:02:00]  I would do that if I was them.  Boy, people around here must be bored if they're coming up with channels called Book Radio.  Yes.  Hi, I'm Sam Roberts, and what show is better than my shit show?  Book Radio.  Yeah, why don't you use that?  Unnecessary.  Yeah.  Was that a real picture?  Me, Anthony, Sean Hannity, and Rob Bartlett all in the same photograph.  That was the Imus thing.  What Imus thing?  At the Hard Rock. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, really?  Kiss me, I'm Imus.  That's on Book Radio's Facebook page.  Book Radio!  Book Radio!  Wow.  I almost brought in a really thick book today.  Yeah.  But we're too busy to do the bit today.  That would just be great to just read a book for four hours on the air.  I got the latest Stephen King novel.  It's called November 22nd, 1963, I think.  Is it macabre?  I don't know.  From the master of macabry.  It looks too intimidating to open up. 
[00:03:00]  Is it?  Yeah, it's like this thick.  It's just a thick one.  A big, fat, thick one.  That's why I love, are people still using Kindles?  Because I use mine.  I love it, because you don't really know how intimidating the book is.  Oh, you know what?  I never even realized that.  Because sometimes, yeah, a big book is like, yeah, I read a big, thick book.  There's so many books I have not read in my lifetime, because they look just too intimidating  on the bookshelf.  They're too thick and stuff.  When you see one of those books, someone suggests a book, right? 
[00:03:30]  You go to the library or Barnes & Noble, when we used to have Barnes & Noble, and you look  at it, and you go, oh, I could get through that.  Yeah, that's okay.  They've got big font, got pictures in the middle.  Nice.  These Stephen King novels, though, holy shit, they sit there like big, huge bricks.  Is this what the morning radio sounds like on book radio?  Book radio!  Book radio!  Because we are, you know, they're talking books here.  Yeah.  We're talking books on the morning show.  We certainly are.  We have to compete with book radio, obviously.  Well, yeah.  I don't really understand why the stock's so low with channels like book radio, man. 
[00:04:00]  It's on its way up.  You would think there's fucking, what?  It's on its way up that stock because of things like book radio and the poster of book radio  lady out front.  Really?  I would think so.  What's the stock up to?  2.10.  Oh.  Something like that.  I thought yesterday was one of those afternoons.  Like, we took it as far as we could yesterday, and I'm like, all right, I'm going home, and  I know I have to deal with problems now.  That's the other side of what we do. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Every once in a while, we have to deal with problems because we go too far with the company.  And I just sat there waiting for the phone to ring, and certainly it rang, and it was  our agent there.  And I'm like, here it is.  They gave him a talking to, and now he has to relay it to me.  Oh, what did he call for?  Because he left me a message.  I didn't get back to him.  Oh, other stuff.  Was it anything bad?  No, good.  Good stuff.  Oh, really?  Future looks bright, my friend.  All right.  I want to get those sunglasses.  Oh, boy. 
[00:05:00]  It sounds like, hey, for everyone.  Is it just like a tea thing?  You're like the captain on that fucking Italian cruise boat, you scumbag.  We're leaving the sinking ship, and we're leaving all you fuckers behind to drown in  the 50-degree water.  Water.  Sounds like, just me, me.  Get me off of this fucking thing.  Take me.  It's dark.  I'm scared.  But I thought it was a phone call, you know, because, you know, we bitched a little too 
[00:05:30]  much about the company yesterday, but I think we were well within our means, as they say.  It was all in good fun.  No, it wasn't.  No, it wasn't.  It was all just a bit.  No, it wasn't.  For the show.  For the show.  No, it wasn't.  No, it says a lot.  Yeah.  The whole poster thing.  It speaks volumes, as we said.  Book Radio.  Oh, wow.  I got questioned a lot about Book Radio yesterday.  Why who?  People.  Oh, no.  One lady who produces.  The lady, what's her name?  I don't even remember her name.  Hey, lady.  Hey, book radio lady has a producer for her interview half hour show. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, my God.  She's a producer.  And the producer was like questioning you.  She came in and said, hey, thanks for the publicity today and blah, blah, blah.  I think their shows should be like the first show of the morning should be the forward.  It's like, hey, welcome to the forward.  And then there's like, you know, I'm chapter, you know, this.  And then the last show, the overnight could be the epilogue.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, what did she say to you?  I should.  Thank you.  Well, what did you say back to her?  Her words were, thanks for the pub, as in publicity. 
[00:06:30]  And you know what I would have said?  What?  Leave me alone, four eyes.  You bookworm.  You bookworm.  She did have glasses on.  Hey, it's bookworm in the morning with you.  That would be a good wacky morning guy.  Leave me alone, you reader.  Yeah.  And then Jane Radio was tweeting me all day as if it's like, it's not about you anymore.  Now we're talking about book radio.  I saw that too.  And she's like, hi guys, if you want me on today.  I'm like, no.  You were just like in the way.  We thought you were book radio. 
[00:07:00]  We thought you were book radio.  I don't give a fuck about Jane and her dumb radio.  What's Jane radio?  I don't know.  It's like book radio, except Jane does it.  Book radio.  It's novel.  Right?  Yeah.  I would fucking go with this.  I should be producing that channel.  I'm brilliant.  Anyway, that was yesterday, I guess.  Yeah.  The one thing that I failed to do yesterday was tweet the picture of the poster they want  to put up. 
[00:07:30]  Do we still have that?  Oh, right.  Oh, man.  The proof, Sobi.  The proof.  Where these idiots photoshopped.  Once again, I'm the victim of photoshopping.  You really are.  The famous story of when we first came to XM and they decided that I wasn't smiling properly  in one of these photos, because they loved Anthony in this one photo, because he had  an eyebrow up.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, I had more fucking makeup on than Ronald Reagan, and it just didn't look like  me.  But they couldn't get enough of the look you had, where you had the eyebrow up, which 
[00:08:00]  is pretty impressive, because I don't think I can move one eyebrow up.  Oh, it rivaled fucking Spock.  It was amazing.  Believe me, I was way up there.  And so they decided that I wasn't smiling properly in that photograph, so what they were  going to do was take up my head from another photograph, and then they were going to open  my eyes real wide, because here's something.  When I smile, my eyes close.  I look like a Chinaman.  It's always been that way.  Yeah, yeah.  But they didn't like that, so they're like, well, we need the smile, we need Anthony's 
[00:08:30]  eyebrow, and we need your eyes more open.  Thank God I'm great at photoshopping, this guy says.  And I looked at him, I go, do not fucking photoshop shit.  I can do better in Microsoft paint than this guy did in fucking photoshop.  Yeah, he goes, don't worry about it, I'm really good at this.  Turns out, he makes my eyes too wide, and he fucking didn't match up the neck, so I have  a giraffe neck in the famous publicity photo.  Yeah, you have like two Adam's apples.  Yeah, the first photo that we were going to put out to the world after us sitting on 
[00:09:00]  the beach for two and a half years.  Yeah.  For being fired.  Good one.  So, I'm a victim again, because they decided to photoshop this picture they took at the  Hard Rock Cafe.  It's actually Anthony's arm going across his chest, but now that.  Yeah, I'm kind of, you know, I'm kind of like got my arm across my midsection.  Look how big my fucking neck is.  That's hilarious.  What a fucking idiot.  Just because they had a great eyebrow shot.  You look like a curious lemur.  I would be.  Huh?  What?  I would be 6'2 if that was a real fucking. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  Picture of me.  That's hilarious.  Doesn't look like you.  No, neither of them do.  No, because they opened my eyes, too.  Yeah.  Anyway, so, so, Ann has his arm across his body, but now they have to squish us into the,  this picture so they can make a poster out of it.  So, now it looks like it's my arm holding Anthony lovingly.  Yeah.  No, you got to get the one they made.  Yeah, the cropped one.  I don't like that.  That's, yeah, that's the one.  Well, we got to find it.  Where is it?  Someone's got it. 
[00:10:00]  He had a hard copy of it yesterday.  Summer really suits me.  I'm very tan right there.  Look at me.  I'm all fucking, I'm all ripped.  Jesus.  You want to jerk off to your own picture?  I should.  My favorite part of yesterday was when he presented the picture.  Yeah.  And you made everybody stop joking and said, no, really, really.  Why the fuck would you show me this?  Oh, man, yeah.  Oh, what am I, what was I supposed to do?  He looks like he should be bookworm in the morning. 
[00:10:30]  I'm listening to bookworm and four eyes in the morning on book radio.  Okay.  Okay.  I don't want to hate, though, when it becomes real and I look right into the guy's eyes.  Lifeless eyes, like a doll's eye.  It looks like he's going to squirt.  I'm like, you're going to squirt?  Yeah.  You're going to squirt?  Bounce the basketball off his head.  It looks like he's going to cry.  I'm like, oh, God.  I got to tone this back, really?  Yeah.  Where's that picture, though?  Because people want to see it.  We'll have to take a picture of the hard copy because there is no. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, I know.  Well, that's easy, though.  He should still have the hard copy.  I mean, he's not here yet.  He doesn't have an office, right?  He's not that important.  Watch it.  He's got to have a cubicle.  Well, no, he shares an office.  It's one of those offices that two people are in.  Shares an office?  What is this, college dorm fucking bullshit they're pulling?  Me and Ann have an office that we don't even see.  Yep.  That could be his office.  We staff our office.  With workers.  With working B.  Yes.  That's our office.  Well, anyway, we've got to get that picture because people want to see it on Twitter and Facebook and all that stuff. 
[00:11:30]  On the Twitter.  We forgot to do that yesterday.  Yes.  The video of Jimmy getting choked out by Gina Carano.  Carano?  Yep.  That was a good one, man.  Jimmy's fucking, that noise he made.  And the second time, I was looking right at him.  He puffs his cheeks up first.  Yeah.  And then he gives this petrified look to me.  It's just kind of pretty much serial killer joke.  Hold on.  I know.  Gina Carano.  Sexy.  Yeah.  I love it, too. 
[00:12:00]  Believe me.  Are we ready?  Yes, we are.  Oh!  I love the sound.  Okay.  Yeah, it's okay.  I love the sound.  That was a really awful sound.  Yeah, it really was.  So, uh...  Just a little bit longer?  Yeah, but that's...  Well, when I tap, stop, though, because I'm going to tap very quickly.  Okay.  We can try it.  You tried to go a little longer.  I wanted to see, can I always panic and tap?  You do panic.  I do panic. 
[00:12:30]  You waited until it really...  Like, that was real pressure, and I would have fucking been helplessly dropped.  Oh!  That's a slow-mo.  Oh, sometimes you just have to.  He looks like one of those stress dolls you squeeze and the eyes pop out.  Yeah, and the eyes pop out.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  And you had a good reference with the Alfred Hitchcock.  Yeah, he looked like Hitchcock when he blew out his cheeks.  He tried to pull his chin down, and then he looked over at me with just the look of utter fear on his face, 
[00:13:00]  and then tapped and made that horrific sound.  That video is in all the usual places.  It's on my Twitter timeline.  It's on my YouTube channel.  Is it on our Facebook yet there, Iraq?  What do you mean, you think?  Isn't that your job?  I didn't hear him.  I was doing the other audio stuff yesterday.  That means it's not on there.  But you're scared to say it's not on there.  Oh, E-Rock.  E-Rock.  Just go to my YouTube channel, OP Radio, one word.  It's the first video.  But it should be on the Facebook page.  That's funny, man. 
[00:13:30]  Anyway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Book Radio.  Yeah, great.  American Idol starts up tonight?  Oh, it is January.  Oh, that's exciting.  What the fuck?  It's already here?  Yeah, I knew it was starting.  It's the second season with Steven Tyler and J-Lo.  Already, huh?  Fuck, really?  Damn.  What was the first one?  Were you in from the first season?  No, I think you kind of turned me on at American Idol way back in the day. 
[00:14:00]  I think you were in.  I was in second season.  Oh, no.  I didn't see the first one was Kelly Clarkson.  And Justin Guarini.  And Justin.  No, I didn't watch first season.  Who was second season?  That was Clay Aiken and Ruben Stutter.  That's the one I got in on was the Clay Aiken-Ruben Stutter pairing.  Then the third season was the best one ever, right?  Really?  With Chris Daughtry and Kelly Pickler.  That was the one Fantasia won, though, and she didn't really.  Oh, no.  Then that's not the one either. 
[00:14:30]  No, Daughtry wasn't in until, well, whatever season Daughtry was in was the best one.  You think so?  Like, musically or entertainment-ly?  Because they're different.  They had some good characters.  I mean, I tapped out.  I haven't watched it a couple years, so it's not even fair I say this, but.  Yeah, I'm done.  As far as my viewing goes, the Chris Daughtry year was my favorite by far.  Season five.  Oh, yeah.  Look at all these powerhouses, and a lot of them are still.  I remember Kevin Kovai, the young croon.  Was it?  No, he was the bird-faced kid.  Yeah.  Was he the crooner? 
[00:15:00]  No, he was Chicken Little.  Which one was the crooner?  I hate a crooner.  Except stupid Taylor Hicks won.  Taylor Hicks won.  Taylor Hicks.  The worst.  What a dumb choice.  And he was a nice guy.  We had him on the show, and he definitely has a good voice, but Chris Daughtry didn't win?  Are you fucking kidding me?  Elliot Yamin and his shark mouth when he first came on, and then he got his choppers fixed.  And then you had Kelly Pickler, and then you had that Catherine McPhee.  Those two are doing very well. 
[00:15:30]  Kelly Pickler and our fat fucking tits that she got after she got off the show.  She got herself some fucking tits.  Yeah, but she fucked her look up.  Yeah.  She was just fucked in.  Who's that chick from Dobbs Ferry?  Where?  Becky O'Donohue.  Oh, remember her?  She was the sex pot.  I like that Becky O'Donohue.  I remember her.  She was pretty hot.  But that was my favorite year by far.  Who's the nice girl in the corner?  Oh, boy.  Brenna.  Brenna.  I don't even remember her. 
[00:16:00]  No, the lower left.  If you think you got a great career by going on a reality show, just look at the lineup  from this year.  Ah.  Half these people you don't know.  You don't know where they are anymore.  And I watched every episode.  I don't even remember.  Fuck you.  What season was, what's his name, that guy that went to Broadway and did the heavy metal  rock, fuck, rock of ages show?  Oh, Constantine? 
[00:16:30]  Constantine.  I see Constantine.  Where's, what season was he?  I see Constantine.  I've seen him more than once on the streets of New York.  Really?  Putting all his baby shit in the back of a cab.  Because isn't he supposed to be kind of a rocker slash, you know, sex symbol?  Constantine Morales.  I met him.  He was on Broadway with Stephen Lynch.  Oh, Bo Bice.  Oh, right, right.  Right?  Let's look at the lineup when he was in.  It was Bo Bice, right?  Bo Bice.  These are names that just are gone from anyone's memory. 
[00:17:00]  We are the only ones bringing these names back today.  Bo Bice is sort of still there.  Although the winner is Carrie Underwood.  She's probably the most successful winner.  Carrie Underwood was the winner that year?  Oh, yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah, she.  Wow, yeah.  And she came from a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny little town.  I remember that.  Who else we got there?  Let's see.  Constantine.  Scroll down a little.  Let me see the...  Oh, that's season four.  Sorry.  Yeah, and then a bunch of...  Yeah.  Who the fuck are they, people?  Who the fuckers? 
[00:17:30]  God.  They're like, yeah, I was on American Idol.  Were you?  Gives a shit.  You were on with Carrie Underwood.  Huge fucking gold record selling beat.  And you're no one.  All right.  I didn't know American Idol started up again.  Damn.  I'm not an American Idol guy anymore.  I like that America's got talent.  Yeah.  I don't watch anything with America's in it.  No.  You just know it's going to stink on ice these days.  Nah, America's got talent. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah?  It's all right.  Yeah.  I like it a lot.  And does it?  What?  America have talent.  I don't know, because people win that show, and I don't know what happens to them.  No, they drop off the face of the air.  I have no idea what happens to them.  Where are they?  Yeah.  They're gone.  Gone!  Oh, boy.  The boss accused of videotaping women in the bathroom.  Bruce Springsteen is a fucking pervert, man.  It says right there.  That guy.  It says right here, Ed.  What happened?  The boss accused of videotaping women in the bathroom. 
[00:18:30]  You would think a guy like that could get any woman he wants if he wants to go down  that road.  Yeah.  So what the fuck is he doing with the videotaping in the bathroom thing?  I got a camera in the bathroom.  Yeah, we know.  Look, I'm not misrepresenting this.  I need Bovo to do this.  Read the headline.  You could read it.  What?  Boss accused of videotaping women in the bathroom.  And it's capitalized, boss.  Yes.  It's Bruce.  It has to be Bruce, I'm assuming.  Bruce Springsteen.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:19:00]  Pinkberry co-found arrested in beating of a homeless man with a tire iron.  Wow, that's sugar.  He must have been on a sugar rush.  That shit gets you all jacked up.  What the fuck did the homeless man do?  He was probably sitting in front of one of the fucking stores chasing off business with  his stench.  That's the guy?  Ooh.  Seinfeld 4?  Cartwright.  Cartwright.  What's his name?  Young Lee?  Young Lee.  Young Lee. 
[00:19:30]  I used to like the Pinkberry.  Yeah?  What happened?  Well...  You realized it was fucking...  No, no.  I still like their product.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  I don't like the people that serve it, though.  Oh.  People I wouldn't like either?  No.  Oh.  No, I'm open-minded.  Yeah.  But they go...  The Pinkberry I go to...  Mm-hmm.  I could keep this like this so I don't get sued.  And this is the God's honest truth.  They hire the uber gays. 
[00:20:00]  Really?  I don't mind the gays.  But I'm uncomfortable around uber gays.  Yeah.  And they feel your discomfort and they don't have a boss around, so they fucking work it.  Really?  Yes!  Well, maybe you.  I'm like, just give me my stupid Pinkberry.  They like you.  Yeah.  No, I see you.  You walk in there and they're like, oh, ooh.  Oh, look at this beard.  Yeah, look at that beard.  Wow.  Bee popping through the shirt.  I like a good bear beard.  They're all like uber gay twinks.  And I'm like, I just want my Pinkberry with Fruity Pebbles. 
[00:20:30]  You see?  See?  Is that like a code?  Like walking around with a red bandana hanging out of your pocket when you order a Pinkberry?  You know, they have all those toppings there.  And I wonder if, like, you know, there's some code that, you know, when you go to Pinkberry,  order the Fruity Pebbles.  Yeah.  Order the Fruity Pebbles.  They know what that means.  But I'm confident about the Fruity Pebbles because Dana White does the Fruity Pebbles.  Yeah.  But I got to tape my Pinkberry because they're so uncomfortable. 
[00:21:00]  Over the top gay?  They're so uncomfortable and they feel your energy and they just work it.  They have to say your name like ten times.  By the way, New York City, the second most gay-friendly city in the world.  I listened to the news on the way in, too.  Thank you.  Why are you telling me this?  Because I was interjecting some gay news into this gay story.  A little side note.  Then people go, wow, New York City's the number two gay-friendly city in the world.  And there are thousands of people right now going, I know what number one is. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  And number one is not what you think.  No.  I thought it was going to be, and that's old-school thinking.  And for the people out there, I'm a mind reader.  Watch this.  I'm reading your mind.  You're thinking San Francisco, number one gay city.  Aren't you?  Aren't you?  And you know what the odd thing is, Opie?  Didn't even make the list.  Very good.  We just listened to the same news.  It sounds like we rehearsed this.  I count on that ten minutes to make me feel like I'm informed. 
[00:22:00]  It turns out to be Tel Aviv?  Tel Aviv.  Tel Aviv.  Tel Aviv loves the gay.  The Jew loves the gay.  The Jew loves the gay.  Exactly.  Tel Aviv.  They love gays in Tel Aviv.  What's that about?  Does anyone know?  I don't know.  That's like a major surprise.  You would have guessed San Francisco, right?  Yeah.  Meanwhile, I guess the gays are a little fed up with San Francisco, saying it's not as gay-friendly. 
[00:22:30]  I think because it's supposed to be so gay-friendly that everything that's not gay-friendly comes off as really gay-unfriendly.  Yeah, I don't know.  Yes.  Gay Israel.  There's gay...  There's a gay Israel commercial?  Israel commercial.  Can we please...  Let's listen to this.  Two guys playing soccer on the beach.  Oh, they just bumped genitals.  You see that?  Oh!  They're bumping into each other on the beach.  Ew, an ugly girl. 
[00:23:00]  Ew, look at her nice tits.  What is this?  It's supposed to be gay.  This guy talking to the chick.  They're shirtless playing soccer on the beach.  How is this gay?  I don't know.  I mean, it's gay, but...  They're looking at a girl.  Oh, is that the gay guy?  He's all mad?  Really hot girl on the beach.  Pause.  All right.  I see what's going on.  I see. 
[00:23:30]  They waited until the end to really gay that video up, didn't they?  Guy's on the beach.  He's playing some soccer with the other guys.  Yeah.  And I guess he's having a good time.  He's gay.  And then there's this hot chick that's on the beach.  And all the guys turn and start looking at the hot chick going like, yeah, that's a hot chick.  And the gay guy's like throwing his arms up like, what the fuck?  Yeah, what the fuck?  This is gay.  This is gay Israel.  What the fuck?  This is gay Israel.  I thought I was in the right place.  But they're all ogling this...  Ogling or ogling?  Yeah, ogling, ogling.  They're ogling this hot bitch in a bikini. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah.  And then, right at the end...  The big reveal.  He turns.  The big reveal.  Some guy wearing a fucking balloon.  A fucking balloon animal making balloon over his cock comes walking down the gay beach  in gay Israel.  And this guy just...  All wet.  He just came out of the ocean.  Oh, he certainly did.  And this guy is now just happy.  And that's why those guys were looking, I guess.  No, I think they were looking at the chick.  Oh, they were looking at the chick?  And that pissed the guy off. 
[00:24:30]  And the guy's like, this sucks.  Right.  And then when the guy comes walking down the beach, he's like, no, it does.  This is great now.  Let's see how it ends.  Yeah, please.  Yeah.  All right.  Now he's mad.  All the guys are over by the chick.  It's no wonder we didn't make it to the World Cup.  Ew.  They were too busy.  Gay Israel.  Gay Israel.  Cock.  This is gay.  The quotes are funny.  Sam, as a gay man...  I'm that gay.  Would you blow off the World Cup for a little ace? 
[00:25:00]  I'm not a soccer fan either, so it's impossible for me to answer.  So would you do a man-ass or a World Cup?  I would have to say World Cup if that's the scenario.  You sure?  Yeah, pretty sure.  Because you really don't like sports.  No, I don't like it.  Especially soccer.  I think it's boring.  It is.  It is.  You're right.  But.  But.  I'm not a gay guy.  But.  I thought you were saying what you really loved there for a second.  The travel agency quotes are,  I much prefer the gay scene here. 
[00:25:30]  For a start, the men are so much hotter.  Yeah.  Here, the men are tall, slim, and tanned.  And that's credited to Brandon from USA.  Brandon is going to Israel to get some fucking big, massive Mossad cock.  Mossad.  Oh, boy.  Well, there you go.  Tel Aviv, number one.  Tel Aviv was number one.  Sam Fran didn't even make the list.  No.  New York, very friendly, though, I guess.  Gay friendly.  Gayness, what were we talking about?  Pinkberry and Free Pebbles. 
[00:26:00]  All right.  Yes.  And the guy in charge of that place that beat up the homeless guy with a tire iron.  Right.  Oh.  Anyway.  All right.  Asian gentleman.  We should talk about the Italian cruise guy.  Mamma mia.  That's a crazy thing going on over there.  I don't know if I could do this justice, but one of the New York papers, I will read word  for word.  Fantastic.  This made me and Aunt Howell over and over again for like 15 straight minutes.  Tapes reveal.  We're talking about the cruise ship that was tilted there. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  A few people died.  Hit a rock.  Tipped over.  11 people died.  I think 27 are still missing.  Still missing.  And the captain apparently not that brave.  No, he left the ship.  Yeah.  As a scaredy cat.  And this is the front page of the paper.  It just says, tapes reveal captain's cowardice.  Yeah.  And this is a quote from somebody else.  What?  The guy on shore there?  Yeah.  And the quote is, get back on board for fuck's sake.  This guy got fucking chewed out like a bitch by an officer of the. 
[00:27:00]  He obviously was talking to somebody and this guy says, get back on board for fuck's sake.  And they're calling him chicken of the sea.  There was an officer of the company, I gather, and this guy was pissed.  Gutless Francesco Schettino.  Yeah.  Captain of the doomed cruise ship, Costa Concordia. 
[00:27:30]  Not only abandoned his terrified passengers, he whined that it was dark out when he was ordered back to help.  This is Captain Scaredy Cat.  He's just a scaredy cat.  Yeah, but you know what?  I told you before the show, he's just a human being.  You can't be just a human being when you're the captain of a vessel.  Oh, really?  It's my charter.  It's my vessel.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  You gotta be the guy that stays on the fucking ship.  Look at that captain of fucking the Titanic.  He just went up to the bridge, shut the doors, and went, bah, fuck it. 
[00:28:00]  What's his name?  Captain Brave Guy.  See?  What was his name?  Captain White?  He sacrificed his life and most people don't even know his name.  Captain Smith.  Oh.  Not worth it.  Captain E.J. Smith.  Not worth it.  Um, I don't know what we're gonna do today with no Wikipedia.  There's so many radio shows with no show prep today.  They're gonna have to do it old school.  That sopa thing.  Sopa!  Isn't that, like, soup in Spanish? 
[00:28:30]  Yes.  Thank you.  I don't trust our government.  How's your asshole?  I don't trust our government.  They'll somehow pass that thing.  I listen to Colin Quinn and read his tweets, and, uh, he says it's a good thing, and we  should trust our government, and everyone should get behind this thing.  Yeah.  Fucking hard.  Man, he took so many fucking hits from idiots that don't get Colin Quinn.  I am Colin Quinn, if you want to check out his Twitter.  Hilarious.  He's the greatest troll ever on Twitter.  He really is. 
[00:29:00]  We'll talk about Sopa down the road, but...  Captain Edward Smith.  Yeah, now he's a brave guy.  Mm-hmm.  When did he die?  Oh, April 15th, 1912.  That was smart.  Yeah.  I would have been pushing women and children right out of the fucking way.  Pull a Costanza in the fire.  Oh, fuck yeah.  We all act like we're real men.  Get the fuck out of here.  You know what the odd thing is?  I would gather this.  When a boat first hits something and starts sinking, it's rare, especially such a big boat,  even the Titanic, that it just sinks in seconds. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  So at first, you must be thinking, all right, it's all right.  This thing can't fucking sink.  Right.  You've got to have that denial phase.  Right.  Where you're just kind of like, all right.  Then I would start thinking, when you start seeing water pouring into places where there's  not supposed to be water on a ship, that's when you start losing that courage.  And, all right, let's assess this.  Let's not rush.  Let's be calm and collected.  That's when the rats start fucking scattering.  And you get crew members, and in this case, a captain, that decides, I'm out of here. 
[00:30:00]  I'm out of here.  And I'm not surprised.  I think most people in that scenario would absolutely flee.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  I leave the ship.  Hey, fucker, you all.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Ya-da-da-da-da.  Was this playing on the deck as it just tipped over? 
[00:30:30]  You can get your own life jacket.  Cause I don't care.  I don't care.  Hey, fucker, you.  Hey, a buffungal to you.  A buffungal, a buffungal.  You're off to not.  I'll leave the ship.  A buffungal to you.  A buffungal, a buffungal.  I leave the boat.  A buffungal.  A buffungal, you mama too. 
[00:31:00]  Da-da-da, everybody.  Da-da-da-da.  Hey, ya-da-da.  That sounds way too real.  Oh, yeah.  That's the captain leaving, tiptoeing onto his life gondola.  And, uh, you think it was romantic as they paddled toward the island?  You think it was just some guy with the hat and the mustache going, ah, amore, amore.  It's screaming people and fucking fire.  Ah, look at this lovely island.  You make it a good fuck tonight. 
[00:31:30]  You are a buffungal.  Da-da.  Holy mother of God.  Of course he left.  This guy was a chicken shit.  Now he looks like an idiot.  Yeah.  Of course he left.  And he could face manslaughter charges.  Really?  All kinds of other nautical charges that they give you.  Look, man.  I've told the story.  I'll tell it quick.  I was in a movie theater.  Smoke pouring into the theater we were in.  There was a fire.  And we had to get the fuck out, right?  And we were in this, uh, one of these...  You didn't yell fire, did you? 
[00:32:00]  You know what they say about that one?  We were all debating that.  Maybe it's time to yell fire in a movie theater.  Sometimes there's a fire.  But we've been programmed our whole lives that that's not a good thing.  That's not covered under freedom of speech, they say.  Even with smoke pouring into the theater, you're like, I think maybe they'll be okay if I yell fire at this point.  I think I'm going to get screwed for this one.  It turned out it was a dumb popcorn machine.  I don't even know if it was officially a fire, but this thing lit up and a lot of smoke pouring into the theater. 
[00:32:30]  So we have to evacuate the theater.  And it's one of these New York City movie theaters where it's either 400 feet in the air or 200 feet in the ground.  This movie theater was way underground.  Why are there no ground-level movie theaters in Manhattan?  Manhattan, man.  It is inside because it's Manhattan, but yeah.  You either have to go up like five escalators to get to your theater or you go underground.  It's really strange.  You're standing there with your ticket in your hand just going whomp around, around, around up the elevator. 
[00:33:00]  I believe the theater was probably three stories underground if I had to guess, okay?  So now we're in a stairwell.  And the smoke is coming into the stairwell now.  It's a real situation because you don't really know what the fuck is going on.  And we're all heading upstairs, although these dummies started going down.  And I'll pat myself on the back.  I told everyone, no, we have to go up.  We have to go up to get the fuck out of here.  Oh, thank you.  It's like the Poseidon adventure.  You're guiding people.  No, we got to go up to go down.  Right.  But everyone was going down, and the person that was last on line was this old broad. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, boy.  With a cane.  But now that we all turned around, she's first on line.  That's not good.  Get the fuck out of the way.  And she is doing a step every maybe ten seconds as you see smoke in the stairwell.  Sorry.  Sorry.  You're the limping zebra in the pack that's being chased by the lions.  But here we all are.  Yeah.  We're all the Italian guy here.  Yeah.  And you see people's patience change every ten seconds when she's doing one step. 
[00:34:00]  And I'm telling you, we have to go three stories.  And all of a sudden, she looks at everyone behind her and says, I'm sorry.  I'm so old and taking so long.  Oh, God.  She knew, though.  But she was in the way.  No one wanted to be the first person to kind of nudge her aside.  Get around.  And get the fuck out.  But everyone was thinking it.  Of course.  Everyone was thinking in their head, how long will I accept this?  Before I have to look like an asshole.  Before survival kicks in. 
[00:34:30]  Right.  And I realize I have to live.  Right.  But the smoke was such where you knew you're still breathing in oxygen.  Yeah.  It wasn't crazy.  It wasn't dark, heavy smoke coming in.  And so we all sort of dealt with it.  But as we got higher and higher, you could see everyone's patience was, like, you know, going away.  That's the worst thing that could happen when people are trying to get out in a quick yet orderly fashion.  But I have no doubt in my mind that every single man would have pushed that lady aside to save their own lives. 
[00:35:00]  If there were flames licking at your ass.  Every single man.  Flames licking at your ass.  Right.  Let's talk about Tel Aviv again.  But we all like to think we're tough guys and we would be the one that goes down with the ship or would stay behind the stairwell and be burned alive as this 80-year-old woman with the fucking cane, you know, took up everyone's chance to survive.  But when you take on the responsibility of ship's capitan, that is something you have to think about and be prepared to do.  No, you take it on knowing that you will never be in an emergency. 
[00:35:30]  So you're like, yeah, I could be that guy.  Really?  But then when it happens, you're like, fuck, I'm not that guy.  Yes.  How many hours of being the captain did he have under his belt?  I don't know.  It's routine shit.  And he never thinks that he's going to be in this situation.  Now, cruise ships like that, really, they rarely have these kind of catastrophic things.  Sometimes there's a fire.  They're pretty good at putting those out.  But a sinking and having deaths on these cruise ships, pretty rare. 
[00:36:00]  So, yeah, he probably didn't think anything would happen.  But I think you're supposed to, you know, stay there and at least command your people to help the passengers.  Yeah.  But, yeah.  But how do you walk around?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I don't think it just toppled over.  That's a hell of a tilt.  Yeah.  I don't think it instantly toppled.  But.  Wow.  But the transcripts are great.  It's Captain.  We've had some reamings like that in the office every so often through our career. 
[00:36:30]  The same type of reaming this guy got.  Get back on the air, for fuck's sake.  Get back on the air.  You know, Ken, I feel like we should take the rest of the afternoon off.  You know, guys, I think you're right about this.  Yeah, yeah.  We should.  Remember when we used to pull that shit?  We used to get free days off, man.  How?  Because we'd say, Ken, there's no way we can go on the air today and not talk about this.  Right.  And it would be something very sensitive, whether it's a Howard issue or a company issue.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:37:00]  So we played it the other way.  Like, look, Ken, I see what you're saying.  This isn't good for us in the company.  But I'm telling you right now, Ken, me and Ant can't control ourselves in this situation.  We're going to have to talk about this.  You know us, Ken.  And you know, look, at least we're giving you fair warning right now that we cannot go on the air and not talk about this.  All right, guys, go home.  Yeah, I go, Ken, but we have an idea.  What's that?  How about we take the day off?  We'll cool off and we'll start over tomorrow.  We'll cool off.  And then he would hit the table. 
[00:37:30]  That's a great idea.  Capital idea, Fester.  And then all of a sudden we get a free day off.  And we weren't going to talk about it.  Oh, that was great.  We'd walk out of there.  We'd look at each other and go, holy shit.  That worked?  We got off today.  And we did that more than once.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Shatino says it's Captain Shatino.  Hey, Shatino.  And who's DeFalco?  What?  Official.  Oh, he's the Coast Guard Port official.  He sings Das Kamisar. 
[00:38:00]  Das Kamisar.  Uh-oh.  De Kamisar's in town.  Uh-oh.  Wasn't that Falco?  It was Falco.  Yeah.  Were you German version or English version?  Uh, I liked German version.  I liked it too, because...  You didn't know what he was saying.  With that, shah, shah, shah, shah, shah, shah, shah, shah, you got the German version?  Das Kamisar.  Hang on.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Why didn't Opie just lift her onto his shoulder like a burly lumberjack and carry her up the  stairs like a hero? 
[00:38:30]  Because I wasn't a lumberjack then.  You walked in front of the Palto camera and somebody commented, you look like you belong  on a paper towel roll.  I know.  You're wearing the red kind of flannel-y patterned shirt.  It's the brawny look.  Yeah.  But I like this shirt, but I can't wear it.  Comfy looking.  I can't wear it until I shave this stupid beard.  Yeah.  Brawny.  By the way, it's not Falco.  What?  Der Kamisar?  It's after the fire.  Oh, you're right.  What did Falco do?  Rock me Amadeus.  Oh! 
[00:39:00]  Amadeus, Amadeus.  All right, give me...  Amadeus.  What about Men Without Hats?  Safety dance.  And Pop Goes the World.  No, no.  Please.  There's no end with Men Without Hats.  Falco did the original.  Das Kamisar, damn it.  People are mad.  They are mad right now.  And then what happened?  Oh, E-Rock.  Then what happened?  And then I guess...  There's a part two from Falco.  After the fire covered it.  And don't give me another song by Men Without Hats.  I will not accept that.  No.  One hit, one hit.  They were a one hit wonder for America. 
[00:39:30]  Everyone was doing the safety dance.  They all had a second song.  Who is this now?  That just didn't work.  This is After the Fire.  What happened to Falco?  Falco has a part two.  Is this the German version?  Shut, shut.  This is the only one that's in the system.  It turns out.  Only one in the system?  Other than remixes.  If it's English, you shut this shit off.  We're all about the German version.  Yeah.  Skut, yeah, that's chicken.  Oh.  Being a child of the 80s, I was embarrassed by the music.  I grew up with... 
[00:40:00]  Child of the 80s, yeah.  Oh.  I remember watching MTV and seeing this instead of some fucking guineas in a house on a beach  that I don't give a shit about.  Oh, when's he coming in?  Dun, dun, dun.  Spike, fight me, one, two, three, but it's not that I don't care.  Wait, what happened?  It's English.  Boom.  If you find the German version, we're all about it today.  Dust Commissar is a song first recorded by Falco in Austria in 1981, covered a year later  by After the Fire, and reworked in 1983. 
[00:40:30]  Thank you.  I think After the Fire made it a huge hit, and then Falco was all pissed off, so they're  like, well, fuck that.  We're doing a part two.  Yeah.  I think that's how it went down.  And then I think maybe Falco's version is the German version.  Oh, is that what he did?  I don't know.  80s on...  It used to be 8.  What channel are they now?  Still 8.  80s on 52 or something?  It's 80s on 8.  Pull up Falco on Wikipedia...  Oh.  Oh, shit.  No Wikipedia today.  Oh.  Hey, why is... 
[00:41:00]  Because our government sucks.  Hey, why are you getting Wikipedia?  Because there's a thing...  Because it blocks it out.  If you hit escape, Travis told me, at the exact second right before the blackout page loads,  you can get to the regular page.  Holy shit!  Yeah.  You found a workaround there, big protest?  And that's why they want this SOPA thing.  You have to do it quick, though.  That's why they want this SOPA thing to go through, because the senators can't figure that  shit out.  They can't figure that shit out.  I'm watching you try this.  It's hard.  But you see how it flashes for a second?  There's a timing issue. 
[00:41:30]  You gotta hit escape right when you hit that, huh?  Yeah.  Wow.  It's like a game.  It's a fun thing.  Why is Google just blacking out the Google logo?  Why didn't they just make their page dark?  They're not really committing.  No.  Too much money to lose in one day.  Exactly.  They don't want to commit.  Look at that.  There's Falco, musician, Wikipedia.  You are like a hacker.  You think there's a senator alive that can figure that shit out?  No.  And that's why this thing will probably pass, because it scares the politicians, the internet. 
[00:42:00]  How did Travis figure that out?  I don't know.  Travis is a...  I think he's technically retarded.  He is.  He's a child of the 90s.  Is that how they figure that out?  Children of the 90s know some shit.  Yeah.  Unfortunately, I'm a child of the 80s.  No, you're not.  I fall short of that.  No, you're not.  Wow.  Yes, I am.  I'm a child of the 80s.  You aren't.  No, I am.  You are a child.  I am.  I disagree. 
[00:42:30]  You are a child of the 90s.  It's  I am.  I'm. 
[00:43:00]  But I don't know.  I am.  We'll be right back. 
[00:43:30]  Children of.  Children of the 80s.  Neither of you were.  I was.  No.  And it's slightly older, so he might have fell short of it.  No, I was children of the early 80s.  Early 80s.  Or a child of the mid to late 80s.  Mid 80s for me.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Is that why?  Yeah.  Yep.  Child of the late 80s.  Child of the late 80s.  I was a child of the late 80s.  No, you weren't.  No, you're a child of the thousands.  Yeah, you're a child of the late 80s.  You're a millennial, they call them.  Let's not forget the second greatest German song ever made. 
[00:44:00]  What?  That would be 99 Luftballons.  Luftballon.  You got 99 Luftballons in German?  German version.  Not English.  Don't want that crappy English version.  We're all about German music today.  All about it.  I love the story about the Italian cruise ship led to German songs.  Led to German songs.  Yeah.  We're so international.  What?  Just sit there and learn, man.  I'm trying.  We have a lot more to learn.  I know.  I was a child of the millennials.  Yes.  The beauty of this?  None of this planned.  No.  Just that.  And who cares? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  We just fucking flow.  It's all a fucking water log flume to 10.  That's why we're pretty much the greatest radio show.  I wouldn't say pretty much.  I would say the greatest.  Thank you.  Thank you.  We never planned a thing.  No.  We don't have no fucking clock telling us what to talk about.  Whenever you do try to plan things, they don't happen.  No.  They fail miserably because of management's intervention.  Management.  You got that German shit.  99.  Where is it?  Is this the German version? 
[00:45:00]  Eric looks like a little German boy in there with his blonde hair comb.  Lederhosen.  Yeah.  He would look great in Lederhosen.  That's something we should do for Friday.  How the fuck do you sing in another language?  I don't get that.  It doesn't seem like it would rhyme.  Don't it have to rhyme?  Yeah.  Like whenever they take an English song and put it in another language, it still has to  rhyme like the English words.  I've always felt like music was for English.  Yeah. 
[00:45:30]  Every time you hear a song in another language, it just sounds stupid.  It sounds silly.  It's great when they translate.  That's Jose Feliciano.  Feliz Navidad.  What?  If an American song has like a guest singer in there, like a rapper, and they mention  their name.  Yeah.  But then if a European band does the translation, they say that they're that rapper.  They never.  It's a literal translation of the song.  That's stupid.  Remember the video?  This zero-assed German girl in the black pants? 
[00:46:00]  With the smoke machine?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot of smoke, and she's clapping, and they have effects on it that you could get  like in-camcorder wedding effects.  Ah, here we go.  Oh, fuck.  See how stupid that sounds?  I know.  The only thing I understand when she says Captain Kirk.  She says Captain Kirk in this. 
[00:46:30]  Luft.  Luft balloons.  What's Luft?  Red?  What's the red balloons?  Air.  Air balloons?  Air balloons.  I thought it was red balloons.  I don't know.  I don't know either.  I don't know.  And Sam, the reason why we're doing all this was because the Coast Guard guy's name was  DeFalco.  That's right.  Oh, that's how this started.  It led to DeFalco.  Which leads to 99 Luft balloons.  It's very logical.  I get it. 
[00:47:00]  So, all right, turn that shit off.  So the Italian cruise guy there, he goes, hey, it's Captain Shatino.  And DeFalco goes, Shatino, listen to me.  There are people trapped on board.  Now you go back.  You will go with your rescue boat under the stern of the ship.  There are some steps.  You climb those steps, and you get on board.  And you get back to me letting me know how many people are on board.  Is that clear to you?  I'm actually recording this conversation, Captain.  Damn.  And then Shatino goes, so the ship right now? 
[00:47:30]  And then it's inaudible.  It's muffled.  Hum-na-hum-na-hum-na-hum-na-hum-na.  Hum-na-hum-na-hum-na-hum-na.  So DeFalco goes, speak in a loud voice.  Put your hand by the microphone to cover it and speak up.  Is that clear?  He's telling him how to talk into the mic during an emergency.  So then Shatino goes, so right now the ship is tilted?  Tilted.  The captain is saying the ship is tilted.  Is the ship tilted?  DeFalco goes, I understand that.  Listen to me.  There are people that are getting off using the rope ladder on the stern side. 
[00:48:00]  You go back there.  You go up that ladder the opposite way.  You go on board the ship and you tell me how many people there are and what they need.  You tell me if there are children, women, or people that need assistance.  And you give me a number for each one of these categories.  Is that clear?  Look, Shatino.  You may have saved yourself from the sea, but this will put you through a lot of trouble.  It will be very bad for you.  Get back on board for fuck's sake.  Unbelievable reaming.  And then Shatino goes, officer, please. 
[00:48:30]  And DeFalco goes, there are no pleases.  Get back on board.  No pleases.  Please assure me that you are going back on board.  Shatino says, I'm here on the rescue boat.  I'm right here.  Yeah.  I'm on the rescue boat.  DeFalco.  What are you doing, Captain?  Shatino.  I'm here to coordinate rescue operations.  From the boat.  From the safety of his lifeboat.  We might have to redo this with Roland.  Roland would be perfect. 
[00:49:00]  I was here.  DeFalco says, what are you coordinating?  Get back on board and coordinate rescue operations from on board the ship.  Shatino.  Inaudible.  So that's more of the...  DeFalco.  Do you refuse to do that?  Shatino.  No, I'm not refusing to do that, sir.  DeFalco.  What?  Are you refusing to go back on board?  Shatino.  No, I'm not refusing to go back.  I'm not going back.  I'm not going because the other rescue boat stopped. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, Jesus.  This guy's got excuses.  DeFalco.  Get back on board.  He's obviously yelling.  Yeah.  This is an order.  You don't need to make any other assessment.  You have declared that you have abandoned ship.  Therefore, I'm in command.  Get back on board right now.  Is that clear?  Shatino.  Officer.  And then DeFalco.  Do you hear me?  Can you hear me?  Shatino.  Yes, I'm getting back on board.  People are suggesting this is just like book radio. 
[00:50:00]  I know.  No, no, no.  Book radio.  It's newspaper radio.  Oh, we are doing newspaper radio.  DeFalco.  Then he says, I'm getting back on board.  And then DeFalco says, then go and call me right away when you're on board.  There's my rescuer there.  There's my rescuer there.  I don't know.  Okay.  That's funny.  Ah, turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  Turd.  The boat's tipped over, turd.  Shatino, where's your rescuer?  DeFalco.  My rescuer's on the stern side.  Go.  There are already bodies, Shatino.  Go. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, man.  Shatino.  Officer, how many bodies are there?  DeFalco.  I don't know.  I know about one.  I've heard about one.  But you must tell me.  Fuck.  He's yelling fuck.  Well, it says expletive.  So it's either shit or fuck.  Shatino.  Do you realize it's dark out here and we can't see anything?  It's dark.  Right.  Hey.  You want me to keep reading or is that enough?  I like his answer to it's dark.  Oh, okay.  DeFalco.  Uh, yeah. 
[00:51:00]  Do you realize it's dark out here and we can't see anything?  DeFalco.  What do you want to do?  Do you want to go home?  It's dark, so you want to go home?  You want to go home.  Get on the stern of that ship.  Climb the ladder and tell me what can be done.  How many people are there?  Tell me right now, Shatino.  I'm here with my second officer.  You and your second officer must get back on board right now.  Is that clear?  He just keeps saying get back on board.  Get on the fucking boat.  Uh, Shatino, I just want to tell you that the other rescue boat here with other rescuers stopped. 
[00:51:30]  It's just stopped.  Now I've called the other rescuers.  DeFalco, you've been telling me the same thing for an hour now.  An hour.  An hour.  Go back on board.  On board!  And you get back to me right away telling me how many people are there.  Shatino again.  It's fine, officer.  I'm going.  Then go right now.  Uh, it's almost done. 
[00:52:00]  I have my own face.  Shatino and DeFalco in the morning.  Yeah.  Shatino.  Book radio.  I have spoken to the company and there seems to be people still on board.  Possibly about a hundred.  Oh, that's Shatino.  I fucked that one up.  Okay.  So he talked to his company and they're saying there's possibly a hundred still on board.  DeFalco, the angry guy.  And you can't even give me a precise number.  You say there seems to be.  Whoops.  Shatino.  Well, we're carrying out evacuation procedures, but now all the officers have gathered on the 
[00:52:30]  rescue boat with me.  I like how he's just, his voice is getting higher and more meek.  Well, now he's on the rescue boat with a bunch of, you know, people that are supposed to  be staying on the boat.  Yeah.  Uh, where are you guys all on the rescue boat?  Excuse me.  Earlier, you told me you were with one colleague only.  Now all the officers are there.  Shatino.  Yes.  There, there's me, my second officer.  And, and he gets interrupted.  If the officers were able to get down there, it means they were still able to move. 
[00:53:00]  Indeed.  Indeed.  People are calling this Greg Opie Hughes, a one man show.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  With the different voices.  Are we looking at a shorty award?  I think so.  I think so.  Shorty award.  This could be good.  Uh, indeed, he says.  And DeFalco, the angry guy.  Then why are they not going back on board to see what the situation is like?  And then tell us about it.  Thank you.  Send them on board.  Send someone on board to coordinate.  No, it's not. 
[00:53:30]  And then DeFalco, he interrupts again.  Send someone back on board.  He's yelling.  And then Shatino finally just says, I'm trying to coordinate that, sir.  And that's the end of the transcript.  Uh, and apparently he's saying he did get back on board at some, at some point.  Um, let it be known I read this because Ant can't see the font.  Well, I need, I need glasses.  Because that should have been a two-man show.  My eyes are going crazy.  I think I did a good job with Shatino.  You could have been a good DeFalco.  I could have been maybe DeFalco. 
[00:54:00]  But you can't see.  I've always wanted to portray DeFalco.  You just refuse to get those reading glasses, huh?  No, I got them at home.  Get the CVS crap.  You get like.  Oh, I did.  You could get them for like $2.  They're terrible.  They're not good.  I, I, I use them at home because I don't have to like be, um, you know, in front of people.  Uh, but then sometimes I don't use them and I'm reading tweets all night or something.  Yeah.  And I wake up and I swear my eyes are killing me.  Just killing me.  And I wake up and I look like, my eyes look like Arnold Schwarzenegger when he, in total recall when they flew out the window. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, Jesus.  And we're laying on the ground.  That's how my eyes look and feel when I wake up in the morning when I'm reading without any type of, uh, uh, reading glasses.  Now, my faraway vision is fine.  I can see shit that people can't even fucking believe I'm looking at far away.  But close up, reading, gone.  I think, uh, I think the phones start getting bigger again because we're reading way too much shit off our phones now.  Dude, you've seen my fucking phone.  Remember how tiny the phones were getting and then the, now we're up to, you know, the Androids and the iPhones, obviously. 
[00:55:00]  They're going to have to make them slightly bigger because we're, not, not all of us, but a lot of us are fucking having problems because we're reading too much shit off our phones.  Have you seen the, the size of, of my texts?  Oh, that rules.  I, I can't make fun of that.  I made it giant.  Can I do that?  How do I do that?  I don't know.  That fucking rules.  But it's so much better.  And my tweets, um, I think I can make, make those better.  My emails.  Like, I have to make.  Is that in the setting of, um, Twitter, on the Twitter app?  No, I don't, I don't know about the Twitter. 
[00:55:30]  That's just for my text messages.  Add an account, sound effects, photo, font size!  Oh, shit!  Oh, dude, you rule.  Four, I'm down, I don't need, I'm all the way down to 14.  I can be as high as 20.  Get up there.  Where are you going?  I'm going to go 16.  Are you?  Let me try 16.  16?  Let me try 16.  Nope, nope, nope.  Not happy with 16.  Hold on, people.  Why?  Too big?  Too small?  Slightly too small.  Slightly too small.  I don't think I'm ready for 20, but I'm going to go 17. 
[00:56:00]  17?  Let me, I don't know if I made my Twitter.  I'm going 18.  Fuck, I might have to go all the way to 20, man.  I'm in denial.  I'm in denial.  I'm trying to keep it below 20, because that's the highest.  My Twitterific only has smaller, normal, and larger text size.  18 is nice.  You like the 18?  I'm good with 18.  Yeah, who doesn't?  18.  Nice.  Maybe I could use, let me see what just Twitter is. 
[00:56:30]  Twitter.  Nice.  Add account.  Does TweetCaster have the same shit?  I have too many fucking Twitter app settings.  If they don't have font size, I'm done with the...  Settings.  Settings.  Oh, wait.  Image service.  What do I do?  Or refresh, refresh.  They don't have a font fucking setting?  What's up with that?  There should be...  Open gap from notification.  I don't know.  It's very...  Personalized.  Personalized? 
[00:57:00]  Font size!  Test radio.  But they're lazy.  It's either small, medium, or large.  That's the one I got with my Twitter thing.  I can only do small, medium, and large, and I would like...  Oh, that fucking rules, dude.  Thank you.  Isn't that great, right?  You can see better.  It's a little uncomfortable, though, large.  Is it?  Yeah, it's kind of like...  It's right...  It is like...  It feels like it's right in your face.  Yeah.  Well, so the Italian captain there is a scaredy cat. 
[00:57:30]  I don't know, though.  I'm defending him a little bit.  I don't think there's many men alive that wouldn't think about their lives in that situation  and make believe they're doing the right thing and then get the fuck off.  I hate to say it, but I think that's the truth.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  That's a Tom Papa tweet.  Uh-huh.  Fucking Roland.  Where is he?  Roland from OP Radio and Anthony Cumia.  That's OP and Anthony's show.  If Papa's mad, then he should come in.  But some shenanigans were going on after the show yesterday. 
[00:58:00]  Shenanigans or hijinks?  Well, Jimmy's gone for three days, and we got Tom Papa, we got Jim Brewer, and we got Ronnie B.  Yeah.  So I go to Ronnie, Ronnie, it's your choice.  Ronnie goes, I want Friday.  So we're going to have Ronnie B. from Ron and Fez on Friday, starting at 6 a.m.  That's huge.  So now we got Brewer and Tom Papa.  I go, get Brewer for tomorrow and Tom Papa for today. 
[00:58:30]  Right.  And all of a sudden, why was Tom Papa and Jim Brewer scheduled for today without even telling me or in?  Ladies and gentlemen, Roland.  They sent the emails.  They have both of them come in early afternoon.  So you chose not to text me like you usually do.  Why?  No, I had a lot of stuff to do.  I apologize.  Just you told me, we want one day by ourselves.  No, I was thinking about having one day by ourselves.  But then when Brewer was available, I said, well, fuck that.  Me and I could do a solo show another day.  Yeah, if it wasn't logistically sound. 
[00:59:00]  Because Jimmy's going to start hitting the road again anyway.  I didn't hear that last part.  But the first part, I figured today, Papa and Brewer, then tomorrow, nobody, then Friday, Ron Bennington.  Yeah, that's not good.  So where's Tom Papa at?  Is he mad?  If he's mad, he should come in.  I don't want to get Tom Papa.  It's my fault, not your guys as well.  I think it's better for him to come in tomorrow.  Because Brewer, man, when Brewer comes in here, you've got to clear the field.  Failed.  Why did I say it like that?  Clear the field. 
[00:59:30]  Because his story's going on for 30 to 40 minutes, and Tom Papa's going to be sitting  there like a dummy in a hot tub.  Oh, we don't want that.  Not Tom Papa.  No, we don't want Tom Papi.  Papi.  Papi.  Papi.  Tom Papa looking like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So where are we at?  I don't know.  Someone's saying, Roland, get on that fucking boat.  Yeah.  Get back on that fucking ship.  Trust me, I'll be in there swimming, too, to relax.  I'm confused by you, Roland.  You text me all the time, and I didn't get a text about this at all. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, yes, you did.  I found out this morning, because I don't check my email that much, because the company  has decided that you shouldn't be able to check your company email on your main phone.  Right.  So now I have to have a company phone, and I don't want to be carrying two phones around.  And you don't want a company phone, by the way.  You just don't need that aggravation.  No, I know.  Yeah.  Because they own everything.  Right.  I bought a phone.  I bought a phone.  Yeah.  Get this.  And I gave it to the tech people, like, okay, I want to be able to check my SiriusXM mail 
[01:00:30]  on my phone and stuff.  So they're like, okay.  Set up the email on my phone.  So they set up the email, and guess what?  It's in this fine print.  They now own your phone that you bought, if they do anything to it.  It was the same principle as you giving me your flip cam and saying, can you just install  the software on your computer?  And then finding out if we install the software, then the company owns the flip cam.  Yeah.  And then it came time to buy a new phone, so I'm like, okay, I want...  And my phone was still pretty good. 
[01:01:00]  And, you know, I got a lot of siblings that aren't doing anywhere near as well as me,  so I try to hand...  You know, I do some handy down.  Hand me or handy?  Hand me down.  Hand me downs.  So I'm like, my brother would love this fucking phone.  He has a shitty flip phone.  Too bad it belongs to SiriusXM satellite radio.  The company goes, sorry, we can't give it back to you.  And that is their...  I'm like, what?  I bought the phone.  That's their...  Here's their reasoning, too.  The second you do any emails between the company and you, they want accessibility to those 
[01:01:30]  emails, regardless of what happens, so they could fuck you over if there's some problem  and they need a record of the emails.  They don't want you to go, well, it's my phone.  I erased it.  Right.  If you erase it or if you do anything to that phone, it's their property.  Now they could fuck you.  So I still have a work phone, but I don't carry it around at all.  Look at that.  It just sits there.  And every once in a while, I'll check emails.  So it's a dumb company policy.  It's stupid.  It is stupid.  Because I got this phone that I want to have on me all the time, and I can't check a company  email on you. 
[01:02:00]  How dumb is that?  Very.  But Roland knows that, and you usually text me, and you chose not to text me last night.  I was busy yesterday, and I forgot.  And probably, Tom, I'm probably upset, because last time, someone from management booked him  for the show for a phone.  Oh, my God.  I know.  I heard that.  Yeah, see?  But see that?  And they wanted to blame me.  Trust me.  And I said nothing.  Like a little dumb idiot soldier.  So now Tom Pop is asking for Roland's home address.  Oh, shit.  Because he wants to kill him. 
[01:02:30]  Well, tell Tom to come in, but I mean, with Brewer, you know, Brewer's going to tell  his stories.  Stories?  Stories?  Brewer's got...  Yeah, I was sick yesterday.  I took my medicine, and like an idiot, I went home and slept.  Sorry.  There is a...  Are you having a nervous breakdown?  Yeah.  Might as well.  I'm being happier.  Oh, probably not, though.  Why aren't you happy?  Institutionalized?  Why?  What's the matter, Roland?  Probably have a fun meeting today.  Oh, no.  Because of this?  Well, because of this, I have to have people cc'd on emails now. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, tell them, just don't.  Just tell them to shut up like we do.  Dude, I...  Just go shut up.  I tell you all the time that the bosses that I unfortunately have to talk to from time  to time, they say you're doing a great job.  So what's your problem?  I don't know.  They love you.  They said, holy fuck, Roland is really up the bookings on the Opie and Anthony show.  We're happy with him.  So why do you see it a different way?  Because of the way we see it down there.  Oh.  I don't think so.  Down there.  Yeah.  I don't know what that's about.  That fucking... 
[01:03:30]  It's like in the bushes in Vietnam.  Right.  You hear noises.  You go, Charlie's out there.  What do they tell you?  Charlie's.  What do they tell you?  What?  What do they tell you?  Nothing.  So then why are you perceiving it that way?  When one of the guys...  They're probably making faces a money.  Yeah.  But when one of the guys from...  Look, it's right there.  The Opie and Anthony show tells you, holy fuck, they're really happy with your job.  Then why do you see it differently?  I don't know.  Because you see...  They're just different down there, I guess.  Oh, Roland.  No.  It's how you're perceiving it. 
[01:04:00]  Look, we all have our issues with management in this place, but...  I don't really.  But that...  Yeah, really?  It's coming out more and more lately, and I'm loving it.  Fantastic.  But when it's so black and white as, Roland, this is Opie telling you they really like  the job you're doing, period.  That's it.  But when one thing happens like this, they're all like, they're flying in helicopters, like,  oh, what's going on?  Oh, they get all angry with you?  No.  No.  Just one of the solutions and...  We got a solution.  Papa tomorrow, Brewer today, and that's it. 
[01:04:30]  No one's going to give a fuck.  Yeah.  No one is going to give a fuck about this for management, but for some reason, you don't  understand that.  Weird.  I know.  Dick in the ass?  Yeah, dick in the ass.  A little dick in the ass.  Oh, I look forward to the after show.  Oh, my God.  Tom Pov is going, one minute till I was supposed to be on the air with Opie and Anthony.  Grr.  He goes, uh...  Tell him to come in.  Tom, if you're listening, come in.  This is what I do now. 
[01:05:00]  You come in today and tomorrow.  Ah!  Seems like there's tension between him and Rowland.  Oh, man, is there.  I love Tom.  He's one of my favorites.  Why'd you treat him like shit?  Yeah, obviously you don't love him.  Well, I would treat him this way.  And book him for a phoner on the shit show.  On the shit show.  A phoner on the shit show.  Tracy, there's one person I would love to do this to every day.  Who is it?  I won't say it.  Tom Papa.  No, I love Tom Papa.  That's right at the bottom.  I know.  Where are you booking him next?  Book radio?  Who would you love to do this to?  I don't want to say names.  I bet there's two names I can think of that you would love to do this to every day. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, they're calling you Roland Shatino.  Oh, Roland Shatino.  Roland Shatino.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  Pulling a Shatino is going to be like the new thing.  Yeah, you get back in that office.  I'm coining it.  I'm coining that.  Get back in that office!  That guy fucking pulled a massive Shatino.  I know why you're sad today, by the way, Roland.  Oh, I am.  Big headline.  The boss accused of videotaping women in the bathroom.  Right.  Did you see that?  I know.  Bruce.  The boss.  Look. 
[01:06:00]  Look for yourself.  I'm not making that shit up.  I can't see that far away.  It says the boss accused of videotaping women in bathroom.  Well, if the boss wants pussy and sees pussy, he deserves that.  What?  This could be a problem.  He's married.  I haven't seen his wife, though.  And this is kind of a pervy.  I mean, the first one.  This is a pervy thing to do.  No, well, I mean, his wife's on stage.  She has to put her in the thingy.  Here it is.  The boss was arrested and charged with secretly videotaping his employees in the bathroom.  His employees?  The boss has employees. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  The boss employs a lot of people.  The boss allegedly installed a hidden video camera in a bathroom at Kobe Rentals.  Was that some side business he's got, I guess?  I guess so, yeah.  Um, what's please said?  Made that he bought that with the money from his big advance!  Well, they say his new album is angry.  Like, his angriest album ever.  Yeah?  Oh, really?  Maybe because he got caught.  Yeah.  Uh, please said an employee... 
[01:07:00]  It must be a typo.  Please said an employee complained to police that every time she and other female employees  went to the bathroom...  Oh, boy.  ...the boss would go to his office and shut the door.  Ha, ha, ha!  The boss is fucking...  You gotta change your pattern, you dummy.  Bruce is a perv.  The employee then noticed the bathroom view on, uh, the boss's computer monitor in the  office.  Aw, shit.  Police seized the camera in the bathroom during the search along with the VCR and monitor  from the boss's office.  VCR?  Where'd you get that, Sam?  Uh, the boss was arrested... 
[01:07:30]  The boss was arrested and charged with secretly video recording someone in the state of partial  nudity.  Where's that?  Is that next to Oklahoma?  I think we all would love...  See what I did there?  I think we all would love to do this.  Of course we would.  Of course we would.  That's just hot.  And for the dummies out there, obviously, we're talking about a guy named, um, Marco Silva,  not the actual boss.  Marco.  I figure, though, because he's announcing his tour today or tomorrow.  From jail?  No. 
[01:08:00]  Oh.  My mistake.  Bruce.  All right, Roland, go be depressed somewhere else.  Yeah.  Oh, those are the two names?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, pretty much, yeah.  What did the first guy ever do to you?  And the second guy hasn't done the show enough.  He breathed.  Wow.  Why don't you like Jackie Marley?  Oh, shit.  Why?  I don't know.  Oh, shit.  It's come up enough on the show that it's no secret.  But for some reason, he gets under your skin.  Yeah, he just won't shut up.  He's like a Howard guy, though. 
[01:08:30]  That's good for us.  I know.  I mean, I'll book him.  I mean, I'll book Satan for all I care.  But what does he do that bothers you so much?  Just like, don't shut up.  Like, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  He goes, in my house, I have this.  I go, look, I live in a fucking apartment.  You make money.  Shut up.  Jesus Christ, I don't want to hear about his life.  He's booked you.  Just go in there and do your thing.  Jesus.  I didn't know this was going on.  You working out?  Well, I try, but today I probably have like a nice bowl of ice cream and a real Housewives 
[01:09:00]  marathon.  Oh, man.  What is it with some people when they get upset or pissed or something?  Thank God for Bravo Network.  That thing is awesome.  Let's sit there, turn on the Real Housewives Marathon.  Why does Kyle cry so much?  I don't know.  Kyle?  You watch Housewives, don't you?  Which one?  Kyle Richards.  Beverly Hills?  I watched the Beverly Hills Marathon.  Well, you don't even know who Kyle is.  That fucking Kim Richards is batshit crazy.  She's batshit crazy. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  In my humble opinion.  She is fucking crazy.  And all of them, by the way.  You watch?  Are fucking disgusting.  You watch?  Hegs.  When do you start watching?  Well, and this sounds like the typical excuse, but, you know, the girl watches.  Yeah, right.  I know.  I can admit I don't watch this shit.  What the fuck?  Yeah, what are you going to do?  The Alaskan Gold Rush is good, too.  I really don't know what's going on.  I don't watch all the Housewives.  I'll only watch Jersey and Beverly Hills. 
[01:10:00]  And I'll take a peek at Atlanta, because they're sassy.  Sassy.  Hi, Lana.  Mm-mm-mm.  Kim Richards out of rehab and doing well?  She's fucking nuts, though.  She is crazy.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, wait.  No, that's another one.  Kim is on her way.  How old is Kim Richards?  I would say she's got to be Fiddy.  Any, um...  I'm going to go with Fiddy.  Any clue? 
[01:10:30]  Don't try to go to Wikipedia.  Don't try.  Here he goes with his...  Did you see the episode where...  Yes!  Ah, you're in!  Uh, 47.  Nah.  47.  That is ridden hard and put up wet, as we say in the equestrian trade.  Holy fuck, man.  Wow.  Damn, she's been through the mill.  That's a rough 4-7.  She was cute at, like, you know, 10.  She was never cute.  Nah, she was a cute little kid on Nanny and the Professor.  She was what they call precocious, I think.  She had youth on her side, but...  Yeah.  I don't know.  And then she made that movie with the crimped hair when she was... 
[01:11:00]  Real 80s.  And being a child of the 80s, I remember that movie.  And then she disappeared.  Child of the 80s.  And came back as the Crypt Keeper.  Yep.  You were alive in the 80s?  That doesn't mean you were a child.  Child thereof.  Right.  Yeah, where have you been?  What's going on with...  Millennial.  What's going on with Jeopardy Clips?  Uh, Donkey Punch Clip?  I don't know if that's Donkey Punch Clip.  Uh, new Jeopardy Chin.  He was a precursor.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Whatever.  I don't know.  All right, Roland.  And it was on DC TMZ about the Kardashians. 
[01:11:30]  It was staged about their conversation about the husband.  Uh-oh.  Roland's contributing.  Look out.  We did that story yesterday.  Oh.  Yeah, we did.  Oh, no.  Because Anthony watches the Kardashians now.  Ah.  Awkward.  He's going to have a breakdown.  I know.  Why?  He doesn't handle stress well at all.  But why does that mean you've got to eat ice cream now?  Get on a treadmill.  You get back in your office.  Yeah.  And think about that treadmill you're going to be on later. 
[01:12:00]  I just did.  Is that going to happen?  Oh, wow.  Just tell Papa to come in.  Papa, I don't think he's talking to Roland.  He's probably asleep again.  Is he?  I'd be.  He hasn't tweeted in 20...  Oh, you went back to bed.  When anything has ever happened over the years where I've been called or something happens  and it's like, look, we're not doing a show today.  By the time I click my phone off, in between clicking the phone off and putting it on my  night table, I am back asleep.  You're done. 
[01:12:30]  With a smile on my face.  Nice.  Yeah.  All right, Roland.  You hang in there.  Mm-hmm.  Everything's good.  Yeah.  Everything's good.  Bosses love you.  Opie and Anthony love you.  I'm probably pissed at you.  Papa's pissed.  Papa's pissed.  He'll get over it.  Yeah.  At least he's not mad at the show.  He's mad at you.  He's mad at Roland.  You gave him a shitty phone interview.  I think he's more shifted towards Roland.  Oh, okay.  That's the comedy department.  Morons.  Is it?  Yeah.  That's what he made the call. 
[01:13:00]  I did.  All right, Roland.  You're bummed out.  I got to eat.  Yeah, we got to eat.  I have food over here that's getting chilly.  Is it chilly?  It's chilly.  Well, it's not chilly.  It's a sandwich, but it's cold.  Chili.  When we get back, we'll, I don't know, we'll do something.  Sure will.  We might get topical with the sex man.  Oh.  Yes.  I hope he took yesterday to heart when we gave him some constructive criticism about  his sex man segment. 
[01:13:30]  He's so obvious with it.  And it's always, you know, here's a song by a band that had something happen 20 years ago.  Right.  On this day.  And it's like, no, it should be a twist.  It should be something a little strange that has a song that's related to maybe a name,  a place, a thing.  E-Rock, without giving away anything, did you take that to heart?  And will we be pleasantly surprised today?  Um, I took it to heart, yes. 
[01:14:00]  And, uh, I came up with something for later.  Whether you're surprised, I don't know.  All right.  I'm looking forward to it.  We want the people out there.  When I used to be a radio listener, I used to like some clever stuff and go, oh, that's  clever.  Oh.  Oh, that was clever.  And the listeners love to try to figure things out.  Right.  So if you play a song, they got to sit there and go, what does this mean?  Right.  It's not just, oh, 20 years ago, they fucking, you know, did something.  That cue of the D was fucking clever.  Fucking Buckman's cue of the D.  That was clever shit.  It kept people riveted. 
[01:14:30]  Scorch's brain cell stimulator.  Brain cell.  Did he call it Scorch's brain cell stimulator?  Yes.  Scorch's brain cell stimulator.  Do we have one example of the brain cell?  Oh, please.  What is it again?  Brain cell stimulator.  Brain cell stimulator.  Do we have one example of that?  King of the negative.  Scorch.  Damn, am I loving my new font.  Isn't it great to be able to see?  God, is this great.  I love it.  We're going to eat, I guess.  Yeah.  All right.  And I think Brewer overslept, so I don't even know if he's going to be here anymore. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Okay.  Okay.  46% of us have done this at least once while at the grocery store, the answer to your brain  cell stimulator after this.  Oh, fuck.  Get me off the show.  Wait, wait, wait.  Are we really doing this?  All right.  What is it again?  46% and you call in and you got to guess.  Yeah, but when they do that percent shit, that's not clever because that could be anything.  Yeah.  46% of us have done this at least once while at the grocery store at your brain cell stimulator, 
[01:15:30]  ladies and gentlemen.  That's so stupid.  No one's got...  What, did he have a prize he didn't want to give away?  No one's getting that.  He didn't have a prize.  He didn't have a prize.  Maybe that's it.  He didn't have a prize.  The answer is going to be take a taste.  Ah.  You know that I refuse to buy radishes, but I'll take a taste every time I'm in the supermarket?  You son of a bitch.  That is a brain cell stimulator right there. 
[01:16:00]  I'll take a taste though.  Why are you tasting a radish?  I like radishes, but not enough to buy them.  People can understand.  So I'll rip one off.  No, they can't.  I'll rip one off the grouping of radishes, and then you can tell where someone picked  one off, and then I'll eat it as I'm shopping.  Usually the bigger ones that almost look like mini apples.  Radishes don't seem like that grocery store snack food to me.  They're tasty.  I used to bust open a bag of pretzels or something.  Bust them open?  Oh, yeah, yeah. 
[01:16:30]  You just fucking go grab a handful, walk around.  Grapes are great.  Grapes are easy.  You just pop them in your mouth.  Grapes are easy.  You're walking around the store just getting full.  Jess gets upset because I eat entire rolls.  Like a Kaiser roll?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Shove the whole thing in my mouth.  Yeah.  Yeah, because they're not looking at you.  No.  What are they going to do?  Exactly.  Just say, yeah, I'm going to tell them the cashier.  I just tell them.  Yeah.  You never do.  If I get caught, I go, I brought this in with me.  Yeah, I brought this with me.  I brought this radish in with me.  I brought this from home.  And then you grab like a soda or something like that, or a bottle of water, and you drink 
[01:17:00]  it at the register, and then you say that.  They go, uh, that thing.  No, I brought it with me.  You're not going to check a security camera or anything.  So fuck it.  Oh, fuck it.  Dumb soda, especially if you're like buying $100 worth of groceries.  And I've been known to wheel out with, uh, you know, those big bags of charcoal underneath  the cart.  I've done that a couple of times.  Or a case of beer.  They're on to the case of beer water scam, unfortunately.  Well, yeah.  It took many years for them to go.  Anything under the court?  That's why you could still get them, though.  You just got to find a real stupid checkout person. 
[01:17:30]  Right.  One with a face that's a little twisted.  You know what I mean.  I figure if I'm spending $100 at the grocery store, they owe me a little something.  They owe me.  A free soda, free radish, handful of grapes, something.  Something.  Something nice.  I'm giving you my business.  Something nice.  You're giving me food for money.  You're just a middleman.  Right.  Scorch also does the psychotic survey.  Of course, survey has a silent P.  Too much.  Psychotic.  Psychotic survey?  And, uh...  Scorch is...  He's fucking...  Scorch is psychotic survey. 
[01:18:00]  The survey question is, when you were growing up, did you have a cool house to party at?  Capital letters, yes, I did, exclamation, exclamation, or nope, exclamation, exclamation.  And there's a percentage poll there.  I guess 60% of the people said, yes, I did.  Yes.  And 40% said, nope.  So, I guess, six people said yes, and four said no.  It wasn't quite that many.  Not even that many?  We have to split it?  Like, three said yes, and two said no. 
[01:18:30]  Questions where percentages just blow.  So, how many calls?  It's not interesting for anyone.  How many calls do we have for the brain cell stimulator?  Oh, we got two.  Oh.  Yeah.  One from each continent that we broadcast to.  Oh.  All right.  Can we go to break?  Yeah.  I won't eat.  Did you play Anthony from Long Island Hoarders lately?  Uh-oh.  I don't think you can play it since.  I'm going to play it over here.  We had that Robin Broad, the psychologist. 
[01:19:00]  I like her, by the way.  Robin Zazio.  She's a feisty.  I like her.  She talks openly, especially when the mics are shut off.  Oh, yeah.  About the hoarders.  She fucking hates.  Her disdain for them.  She fucking hates hoarders.  Oh, hoarders, they suck to her.  She says, I'm just a good actress.  She's walked off the set, the pigsty.  Yep.  She's walked out of people's houses, disgusted with them, their house.  Yep.  Have to go, because I guess the staff gets, the cast gets a trailer.  Yep.  And just gone into the trailer and been like, I'm not fucking going back in there. 
[01:19:30]  She's great.  Many a times she's taken the cat fucking duty and just smeared it in the hoarder's face.  Yeah, just grab a big gloved hand of cat shit and mush it in the face, much like that grapefruit in the actress's face.  But no one makes her really sick.  She also shoves it in their hair.  Yeah, yeah.  It's really hard to get cat shit out of your hair.  And then beats them down with their own goods.  Yes.  Which is degrading.  That's to demean them.  Usually it's a bag of duty that's laying around.  She'll pick that shit up and just start fucking swinging. 
[01:20:00]  A bag of duty?  Is that Scorch's new show?  What did Scorch do?  He's got Scorch TV back and...  Why is he interviewing Linda Tripp?  Who are they?  That's Cece the Ghost Huntress.  Do you think that mic goes to anything?  No.  Of course not.  It's a camcorder mic?  That pig should not be using is at the end of her name.  No.  Huntress.  Huntress.  It usually means sultry.  Yeah.  Not in her case.  Good speed. 
[01:20:30]  All right.  We're babbling.  So Robin did this for us after her appearance.  The Broad from Hoarders.  On an all new Hoarders.  A Long Island mansion on the brink of quarantine.  And one Italian millionaire who can't let go.  I have seven or 14 disabilities.  Anthony used to have a life.  Until hoarding took over his existence.  This is my stuff.  I'm a collector.  I'm not a hoarder.  What do you want me to do?  You're saying that me?  I am not a good parent?  Dr. Robin tries to bring Anthony back and help him cope with the reality of this situation. 
[01:21:00]  Anthony, your gun closet.  Do you see what's on your gun closet?  There's roaches everywhere.  This isn't good for you, Anthony.  How do you even store food in this environment?  The refrigerator has roaches all inside it.  It doesn't work.  These conditions, they're not livable.  How could you have let it get this bad?  I've Epstein-Barr.  That young girlfriend of yours moved out?  Danny doesn't even come over anymore.  Oh, they didn't care. 
[01:21:30]  No.  Oh my God.  What's that?  Doctor, we found a skeleton.  Is that a...  And then my dog died in here.  There's roaches in the movie theater.  A karaoke stage filled with rats.  Raccoons crawling over child pornography.  It's like a carnival of garbage.  All on the next...  Orders.  The O.P. Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  Mary Barry's here?  Bring him in!  Oh, hilarious. 
[01:22:00]  Get him in here, Jimmy!  Get him in here!  Mary and Barry.  It's right outside.  Former governor of Washington, D.C.  Got busted smoking crack.  Came back and won again.  Right, didn't he?  Did he come back again?  He did.  Become the mayor again?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  One of the biggest comebacks ever.  Yeah.  Got caught smoking crack.  And the best thing was when they were interviewing people, like in D.C., go, everybody smoke  a little crack now and then.  Who's going to smoke a little crack?  Everybody smoke a little crack.  And all these people are like, what do you think about Mary and Barry coming back into  the office?  I don't know, man.  He's smoking a little...  What's the big deal?  Most of the population agree. 
[01:22:30]  They're like, sure.  We do.  Why not?  Why not a little?  Yeah, that'd be nice.  Get him in here a couple minutes.  There's a bunch of dudes next door that are cock blocking.  He's shaking his head no.  There he is.  Mr. Mary and Barry.  Mr. Mary and Barry.  Give him a microphone.  Give him a microphone right now.  Give him a mic.  Hello, sir.  We'll be nice.  We'll be nice.  We just wanted to say hi to Mary and Barry.  How many of you are in here?  One, two, three, four.  Yeah, we got a lot of people in the end.  Gang up for me, man.  No, no, no. 
[01:23:00]  Totally respectful.  No ganging up.  No, sir.  Thank you.  You're actually an inspirational story to a lot of people because things went bad at  one point and then all of a sudden you came back and you got redemption.  It's a pretty inspirational story.  That's why this movie is so important because most of the media outside of Washington, D.C.,  most of the people outside of Washington, D.C. only know me through 15-second news clips  or 30-second news clips or some negative article in the newspaper.  They don't know about my 50 years of service and 35 years of political life in Washington 
[01:23:30]  and being very successful, helping a lot of people.  So that's why that's important.  I was walking by and heard you all say something about being popped for smoking crack.  Put that in context.  The FBI spent $25 to $40 million trying to entrap me.  They couldn't find anything financial on me because I don't dip into the deal.  They used that situation, set it up.  And we don't know what was in that pipe because the jury didn't convict me of anything at the Vista. 
[01:24:00]  And so that crack story started with that.  But there's been no evidence that we don't know what was in it.  I mean, I was up there for some other reason, quite frankly.  What did you think was in it when you were smoking it?  I didn't smoke it.  Oh, okay.  I took one drag on it.  Oh, okay.  Do you feel that they were trying to railroad you because they didn't like politically what you were doing?  They didn't like me economically and giving money to African-Americans and, you know, qualified contractors and putting parts about this size.  And we take it 47% of it, which I got to. 
[01:24:30]  And they don't like the money to be taken.  It is pretty amazing that they can do that, that they can go after you like that and spend so much money to try to prosecute you.  But, well, I'm used to it.  They're pulling you out.  They're pulling you out.  We are being married.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, Barry.  What's the name of this show?  Opie and Anthony.  How many of you are Opie?  That's one Opie.  There's one Anthony.  That's Anthony.  And a room full of our friends.  And I'm basically the driving force of the show, Jim Norton.  Don't stand for spirit.  We love you.  You love me. 
[01:25:00]  Sirius XM.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to Opie. 
[01:25:30]  Get in topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute. 
[01:26:00]  With the sex man.  Good morning, sexy.  Good morning.  Wow.  All right.  Sexy is Michael Jackson.  And a little Michael Jackson.  That's going to mean Lisa Marie Presley probably divorced him.  There you go.  What?  16 years ago.  No, but it's still.  No, it's still. 
[01:26:30]  But this is what Anthony was talking about.  This has nothing to do that was obvious with it.  Michael Jackson.  Michael Jackson.  Yeah, it's Michael Jackson.  And it's a song that he does.  And you're talking about what happened to him years ago.  It's the same as everything.  I think we're losing focus.  It's called getting topical.  There's nothing topical about that.  There's two topical things.  But whatever.  I thought it was bit dead.  There you go.  He's mad.  What's the two topical things?  Well, before this, I played the short, brief interview we had with Marion Barry. 
[01:27:00]  He was arrested for drug possession 22 years ago.  But it's not topical.  I thought that this was going to be like.  Well, it's topical because it's the anniversary.  Right.  Glee is doing a Michael Jackson show.  And then you play Michael Jackson.  And then that's topical.  Who the fuck watches Glee?  It's news.  It's topical news.  No, it's not.  Just talking about what happened 22 years ago.  It's not topical.  Why do you watch Glee?  I don't watch Glee.  You watch Glee.  I have watched Glee.  You watch Glee.  Regularly watch Glee. 
[01:27:30]  I understand the topical thing because of an anniversary.  So I'm not even doing the topical thing.  But again, this is exactly what has been happening.  It's a guy that's singing a song.  That's all this bit ever was.  I know.  But Ed just explained that.  Maybe we should do a little more with it.  Stop trying to give it depth.  It was an obvious thing just to kill some time in the first break.  But you finish eating.  Hey, this happened.  Great.  Move to the next topic.  Here's my vision.  All of a sudden you hear something that's so different.  Like that our normal rejoin is like. 
[01:28:00]  Okay.  All right.  Now that's deep purple.  Why deep purple?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then we ask you a couple of questions and try to figure it out.  Right.  Right.  So in this case it would be.  All right.  Michael Jackson.  So something happened with Michael Jackson.  You would say yes.  And then obviously it would probably be.  He got divorced.  It's music by the guy that's involved in the story.  See, I was thinking you would go way out of the boundary here.  And if it's you're playing Michael Jackson, it would be like. 
[01:28:30]  Well, the song is in the closet and it's about her divorcing him.  I don't know the song.  I've never heard the song.  It's a little more obvious.  Yeah.  I've never heard this song either, which is, you know, kind of like, huh?  But I'm trying to think of a really good example.  Like, like.  Well, look at the sheet.  Let me look at the old sheet.  Like Willie O'Ree.  Willie O'Ree was the first black hockey player.  Oh.  And he made his NHL debut 54 years ago.  So you could do some kind of, like, black thing.  Right. 
[01:29:00]  Straight out of Compton.  Or the Jeffersons debuted 37 years ago.  You could play the house next door to me with salted.  What?  What?  Well, but it would work.  Right.  And it would be a little different than just playing the Jefferson thing.  Yeah.  What would you play for the Willie O'Ree?  First black hockey player.  You know what I'm saying?  I don't fucking know.  I would play Vanilla Ice's Ice Ice Baby.  That's great.  Just, it's so out there and obscure, but it's ice, it's hockey. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  And if we gave you shit about it, you'd go, look, I fucking went way off kilter on that one.  I capsized the bid.  So playing a song that you guys weren't familiar with, even though it was by that artist with the story, isn't way off kilter?  No.  No.  This is everything you've done.  It's the guy or the band.  It's their song.  And the story that you're putting it to involves the guy from the band or the singer of the song.  So it's the same thing. 
[01:30:00]  I'm thinking you really shake it up and get a little weird with it.  Oh.  Yeah.  Try to figure out something for Willie O'Ree.  Like, what team did he play for?  I don't know.  Wikipedia's down.  Oh, well, if you hit that escape key.  I think he played for the Quebec Nigers.  Oh.  Those guys.  Used to be a big fan.  Yeah.  Before they were, little known fact, before they changed their name to the Nordiques, they were the Nigers. 
[01:30:30]  Right.  Yeah.  I remember that.  That's stupid.  Happy birthday, Dave Attell.  47.  Listen, people.  Come on, people.  Jason Segel's only 32.  We like the Jason Segel, too.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Oh, you got it?  Oh, yeah.  Who did Willie O'Ree play for when he was the first black hockey player?  Sam's saying yes because he got around the Wikipedia blackout. 
[01:31:00]  Yep.  People are just tuning in.  There's a way to do it.  Yeah.  Bruins.  The Bruins.  What?  The most racist fucking city in America?  Didn't the first black baseball player, too?  Where was he?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was...  I don't know.  No.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah?  What?  Pumpsy, right?  What about Pumpsy Green?  Wasn't Pumpsy Green the first black player in the American League or something like that?  And he played for the Red Sox?  Red Sox. 
[01:31:30]  Now you're going for Pumpsy Green.  Oh, you don't spell Pumpsy that way.  Oh, my God.  Why are you spelling Pumpsy?  Everyone knows it's S-I-E, Sam.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, Sam.  Right into Wikipedia.  But that's pretty impressive.  That's a good talent.  That's a child of the 90s right there.  Yeah.  A child of the 80s, me and Ant, not so much.  Not so much.  We can't figure that Wikipedia workaround.  I'll work a Commodore 64, though, because that was out in the 80s.  Fuck, yeah.  Where I was a child.  An Atari.  Yeah.  Proven that I was a child of the 80s.  Atari.  No.  Yes.  An Atari 800. 
[01:32:00]  Yes, Atari was hopefully in the 80s.  I played Star Raiders on the Atari 800.  That was great.  You were 27.  No, I wasn't.  I was not 27.  What?  You calmed down.  Now, what's up with Pumpsy Green?  He played for the Red Sox.  First black American leaguer?  Maybe he was the last.  Or no, he was the last team to have a black player.  He was the first black player to play for the Red Sox. 
[01:32:30]  Right.  Many years after everyone else accepted the black man.  Who was the last major league club to integrate.  See, that's making more sense now.  Of course.  The last first.  That's how Boston does it.  Yeah.  They wait until the last possible moment.  Yeah.  Second.  Hey, we got best man speeches.  Are we doing a best man speech thing?  Oh, my God, yes.  We are?  Oh, yeah.  When did we approve this?  Actually, you guys approved it years ago.  Years that we've been trying to do this. 
[01:33:00]  Oh.  Remember?  For years, we were trying to get some good, bad best man speeches.  I think finally, with technology, we can finally do the bit.  Yeah, because you don't have to get it off of a fucking VCR, send a videotape or some shit.  Now, it's easy.  You just email it to us.  Yeah, with your phones and stuff.  So maybe it'll work this time.  Hope so.  Because we realized you had to get the big, stupid, yeah, VHS tape and transfer it and send it in.  And no one was going to do that.  But maybe they'll do it now.  Hey, what's that picture?  Hey, that picture could be used. 
[01:33:30]  Hey, what's that?  Go back.  That's our poster.  Hey, wait a minute.  Well, it's Jimmy.  And they switched.  But what if.  They switched us.  What if you shop out Jimmy, right?  We're looking at the picture right now.  It's Opie, Jimmy, and me.  And Jimmy's got his hand lovingly on my kind of shoulder.  Yeah, let him hold you lovingly.  Now, shop Jimmy out of that whole thing.  And you could put you, slide you in front of that just enough so it covers up the hand a little bit more and should shop the hand out. 
[01:34:00]  And that's the shot.  You're on the left.  I'm on the right.  It's pictures we both like.  What the fuck?  Or put my head upside down.  Could do that.  It's actually the same picture.  It should extend your neck, though.  It is the same picture.  See, I was to the right of you.  They were.  Well, why the fuck didn't they do that?  Well, that's shopped as it is.  Yeah.  But now.  But I'm looking away from Anthony in that shot.  That's a better shop, though.  Whatever.  A best man speech.  So we're looking for worst best man speeches, I guess. 
[01:34:30]  Or the best worst man speech.  What are we doing?  The worst.  Why don't we cancel Papa?  Obviously, Brewer's not showing up.  Oh, shit.  You have to talk to Roland.  He obviously made a mistake.  Oh, my God.  We left ourselves with nothing.  Who cares?  I don't.  We're doing all right.  I'm fine.  Best man speech.  We're looking for really bad ones.  Or the worst best man or maid of honor speech.  The email is opianthony at SiriusXM.com.  Okay.  And all the rules are at SiriusXM.com slash opianthony. 
[01:35:00]  What rules are there?  Well, you could win $1,000 from Steven Singer.  Nice.  That Steven Singer is a good egg.  I think this time around we'll get some, finally.  Yeah.  Because people are videotaping all sorts of shit with their phones.  Get some.  All right.  Well, here's an example of what we're looking for.  For those of you who don't know me, I'm Dave.  I'm the best man, obviously.  Boy.  I've been doing Clayton and Alicia for a little while. 
[01:35:30]  So, good while.  But I just wanted to say that, I'm not big on speeches.  I can personally say that, all right.  Oh, boy.  Well, I've known Clayton and Alicia for a long time. 
[01:36:00]  Speech isn't really working out, obviously.  I just wanted to say that we've been together for a while and we've seen them together.  We're always happy.  And I just like to wish them luck.  And I know they'll have a good many years behind them.  Behind them?  What?  I like to wish them luck.  So, here's the...  Playing Alicia in years.  Wow, that was really hard to listen to. 
[01:36:30]  You know what?  This brings up a really good topic.  I've been the best man, I think, three times.  Yeah.  You put people in horrible, horrible positions.  Yeah.  You can't enjoy yourself.  That's true.  As soon as they say, hey, you want to be my best man?  You're like, yeah.  And then the second thing you think, holy fuck, I got to do the speech.  And then from that moment until you do the speech, it's nothing but anxiety and stress.  And you can't enjoy any of the festivities leading up to the wedding. 
[01:37:00]  Even the bachelor party.  Because even while you're sitting there with tits in your face, you're like, fuck, I got  to do that speech.  Yeah.  I haven't even started the speech, the speech, the speech.  Right?  Well, Kevin from Connecticut's got a great idea.  Has anyone ever made Big A their best man?  Oh, wow.  Look, for anyone who's...  That would be great.  For anyone who's thinking of making me their best man...  Yeah.  For the fourth time, I am bringing Big A in.  Big A is the pinch speech maker.  I will pay all expenses. 
[01:37:30]  Somewhere on my computer, I have Travis's best man speech.  Oh, shit.  That he did at our old buddy Than's wedding.  Is it good?  No.  Oh, man.  I'd love to hear that.  It's just uncomfortable because he brought up when Than and his new wife broke up for a  while.  Why would you bring that up?  Oh, no.  What's wrong with him?  I'm going to bring it in.  Oh, I was the best man at Joe Curry's wedding.  My buddy Joe Curry.  And...  Did you do well, or...? 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, I just winged it.  I went up there and winged it.  But you kind of do this for a living.  That's just it.  I'm talking about, you know, the average Joe's there.  It's like the worst thing ever to be picked as best man.  That's just it.  Like, I knew that.  Because you don't want to do the speech.  The second...  The emcee, you know, the wedding emcee, he...  I go over to him because it's time for the speech.  He hands me the mic, and he goes, uh, the button's on the side of the microphone.  Yeah.  And I just turned...  I went like, yeah, I got it.  I got this.  I got it. 
[01:38:30]  Don't worry about it.  I won't pull the fucking...  I think I got this.  The little cord out of the mic either.  Don't worry.  Yeah.  So, uh, I just gave it a...  I know...  I've known Joe my whole life, pretty much.  He also was a child of the 80s, much like myself and Opie.  I know.  Yes.  Yes.  And, uh...  You like if we say children of the 80s?  Is that the problem here?  No.  I would like if you used the 80s part.  A different decade.  We are children of the 80s, officially.  Yeah.  Unofficially.  No.  Officially.  Be silly.  Do the math. 
[01:39:00]  Yes.  I've been, uh...  I've been to probably 30 to 40 weddings easily, and I've...  Remember maybe two to three good speeches.  Good speeches.  The rest are like this.  People are just suffering.  And, um...  I'm having a...  Bye, sir.  Bye.  Bye, sir.  What happened, Travis?  You hit the nail right on the head.  Like, it's just...  It's not fun.  And I probably wouldn't do it again.  I...  There's two people that I would do it for, but just like you and Joe... 
[01:39:30]  But you can't say no.  If someone asks you to be the best man, you have to be the best man.  You have no choice.  And you have to know the guy really well.  Yeah, that's the thing.  Like, there's two people who I've known their families for, like, my entire life.  So, like, if I'm sitting in a room with everyone that I already know, that's fine.  That's fine.  You know what to say.  You know the people.  You could do little jokes about them.  That's fine.  Yeah, but other than that, it's just not fine.  It's painful.  One of my best man speeches, I actually used the words, you know what I'm talking about. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, shit.  And guess what?  And I said that, and no one knew what I was talking about.  And then, God bless my Uncle Henry, he goes, I'm with ya!  He yelled out.  Yes, he goes, I'm with ya!  Oh, boy.  I think right when I was finished, I think the first thing Sam said was, I recorded the  whole thing.  Oh, yeah.  Was it bad?  No, it wasn't bad.  It wasn't bad.  Yeah, Sam's got it.  I mean, we played it on the old Fan and Sam show.  Oh, I remember that.  It's not terrible. 
[01:40:30]  I've heard...  Where you left, Dan?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is, yeah.  Before I left, Dan.  Is that what happened?  Left him hanging?  What do you mean, left him hanging?  I'm not a babysitter.  You left him hanging?  I didn't leave him hanging.  He's working at Rockstar now.  I'm not working at Rockstar.  That's true.  Probably makes more money than you.  He's got to.  Probably.  It's full time.  Guess who was smarter in that case?  Than, I guess?  Yes.  Okay, sure.  Yeah, but who's got more radio shows?  I would definitely say that I do.  Who gets to play games for a job? 
[01:41:00]  What the fuck is that about?  So he wins again.  Jesus.  How many radio shows you up to?  At least 30.  I don't know.  I mean, a lot.  You want another best man speech that went horribly wrong?  This is for the contest.  The worst best man...  Is that the end?  That other one?  That was it?  That's how it ended.  The worst best man, maid of honor speech, because the ladies can be involved with this, too.  Oh, yeah.  Because now something happened, too, where the women have to talk as well.  Old school, it was just a guy.  Right.  Yeah.  And then somewhere, a child of the 80s, so when I got into the 90s, somewhere in there, 
[01:41:30]  they decided to change the whole thing, and now the maid of honor has to talk at every  morning, too.  But women have it so much more easier, because guys are expected to be funny and joking in  their speech, and women are generally sweet.  Trying to be sweet, and they just get some dumb Irish poem.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, God.  I could do that.  What do you mean to me?  What friendship really is?  What friendship really is? 
[01:42:00]  Shut the fuck up!  Webster's defines friendship.  Yes.  Here's how I define friendship.  Mouth to pussy in our college years.  I was going to...  Oh, you beeped it.  What were you going to say?  Our friendship started in the third grade when we were finger-panging each other.  Yes, where we diddled each other's little vaginas for the first time.  Little did we know that the friendship would endure to this moment.  The dick that your new husband slides inside you is going in the same place my tongue had 
[01:42:30]  been many, many times with my good friend.  So raise your glasses, people.  Everybody!  They're all just fucking stunned.  Oh, my!  Butthead faces.  Yeah, they got to be all sweet.  If this isn't my coffee, man.  Oh, this is going to be hell to pay.  I'm going to fucking kick somebody.  Hell to pay.  Nah, it's your coffee.  My coffee, Sal?  This guy's good.  Sal's fucking good.  Remember that raise you gave yourself?  Fucking double that shit.  Nice.  Nice.  Double that shit. 
[01:43:00]  Three bucks.  Here's another best man speech that went wrong as an example of what we're looking for  for our contest.  I hope we get real ones from our listeners.  It would be great.  Yeah, I remember my wedding speech.  It was, you have the right to remain silent.  Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.  You have the right to be an attorney.  And you have the right to pay your wife's attorney.  Yeah.  Fucker.  Yeah.  Didn't work out for a while now.  Fucker!  Brewer's here, too.  So we should maybe...  How many of these we got?  Where's Papa?  We got three.  Oh, he's not coming in.  Oh, shit. 
[01:43:30]  When did that happen?  Oh.  Seven o'clock.  Why is the third one six minutes long?  Nice!  That means it has to be great.  Danny cut these.  And if Danny cut a six-minute clip...  Oh, I trust Danny.  Yeah, it's worth it.  I absolutely trust Danny.  Steve, not so much in the past.  Oops.  Did that just come out?  What?  Did that just come out?  Yeah, he just...  Steve sees me God for so long.  Yes!  Why would you say something nasty about him now?  Did that just come out?  Yeah!  Oh, fuck.  Why do I keep getting brought up on this show? 
[01:44:00]  It seems unnecessary.  I've been God for 16 years.  I love Steve.  He knows it.  Yes.  We text every once in a while.  But you don't think he's good at cutting up audio?  Did that come out?  Oh, yeah.  We'll save the long one for after Brewer's out of here.  Maybe tomorrow.  But this one we can play before the break.  Another really bad best man speech for our contest.  And go to SiriusXM.com, I guess.  SiriusXM.com slash Opie and Anthony.  Or you can go to our Facebook page.  We've got the link up there.  Oh, we do?  Yeah.  Do we have the latest video up there yet? 
[01:44:30]  It's also up there, yeah.  All right.  If you want to see Gina choking out Jim Norton, it's finally up on our Facebook page.  Yeah, it's a great speech.  I got prepared.  I'm going to wing it.  I'm going to wing it.  There you go.  I'm going to wing it.  Yeah.  I know my brother for 24 years.  Of course.  Christina for most of them.  I don't know what I'm supposed to say. 
[01:45:00]  I wish him lots of love and happiness.  Hope they, uh...  Hope we can do this in about 25 more years.  Because I might actually have them prepared by now.  How about we want to take a drink?  Cheers. 
[01:45:30]  Wow.  He gave them nothing.  Yeah.  He said he was going to wing it.  All this talk is...  Oh, I thought he said wing man.  No.  Oh, wing it.  What?  Wing it.  I kind of want to make E-Rock my best man.  I already did it.  Gave my brother.  Just hearing all these speeches really makes me want E-Rock to be my best man.  So why don't you do something different?  You got a best man, but you have a best man speech guy.  Speech maker.  E-Rock, would you speak at my wedding?  No.  Why not?  No.  We're bros. 
[01:46:00]  No.  See, we can't go with the obvious for this bit.  You have to go a little more in depth.  Oh, see what he's doing?  He's goofing on what we want his bit to be.  His sexy bit.  He doesn't know anything about bits.  I don't know.  He's clueless.  No, but you keep putting me in them, don't you?  What?  What happened now?  Why are they angry?  He's upset because the Michael Jackson thing.  Yeah, he thought it was going to work.  He thought that was it.  He was excited about that.  See, E-Rock.  This is what he heard.  This is what he heard.  See, E-Rock?  That's what we were looking for. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  And meanwhile, he just got smashed that it was the same shit.  He's not an above and beyond type of guy.  No.  No.  No.  Why don't you just make Eric a groomsman and then he can...  You want to be a groomsman?  No.  Groomsman.  Yeah.  You want to be an usher?  No, I'm busy.  Thanks.  Bridesmaid?  Shit.  Tom Papa is now tweeted.  Tom Papa on Twitter.  P-A-P-A.  You should get some followers out of the fact that he got fucking blown off today by Roland.  He's like, he's trying to bait Roland. 
[01:47:00]  And someone is asking Papa what kind of bait.  And Tom Papa just tweeted, using Ben and Jerry's as bait.  He's pissed at Roland.  And he bought rope, he said.  Oh.  So, he's not happy.  Roland can't stay down with three barrels in him.  Not with three.  He's very pissed at Roland.  Yeah.  But Roland, you know, he blew him off.  So, I don't know what to tell you.  He keeps fucking with him.  Tom Papa on Twitter.  All right.  Brewer's here.  And E-Rock, who knows a little bit about everything. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Told me that Brewer has a fantastic story about his dad today.  Oh.  Well, we've been keeping tabs on this whole thing.  That involves.  Through documentaries and his appearances here.  Oh, it was tragic.  His father had a situation.  Oh, boy.  A medical situation.  Oh, good.  But wait till you hear all the details.  Oh.  Is it funny?  Depressing?  Tragic?  Depressing?  Funny? 
[01:48:00]  Where does it fall in?  Is it like a Lifetime movie?  It's pretty hilarious.  Oh, okay.  All right.  As long as I don't want to go away feeling all bad.  With slight tragedy.  Oh, Jesus.  But then more hilarity.  Right?  I think it ends with hilarity, if that's okay.  As long as it ends with hilarity.  I believe it does.  Yes.  So, he'll be hopefully telling that story.  And I think he has a Pizza Man update.  Yes.  And other things he wanted to talk about last time.  Pizza Man.  But we got too busy.  He's starving.  Fuck.  One of my favorite people is up next.  Jim Brewer.  Stay there.  The OPN3 channel. 
[01:48:30]  He's so horny.  Sirius XM.  Hey, kids.  Why spend Saturday watching boring cartoons about fighting aliens when you can help fight  real, illegal aliens?  Head to some real-life Saturday safety fun at Ammunation with Derek the Dodo.  Yay!  Hi, kids.  I'm Derek the Dodo.  Today, I'm going to teach you all about gun safety.  Doesn't that sound fun?  Yay!  Guns can be very dangerous, especially to little people who don't like hole-shotting them, 
[01:49:00]  or to birds on deserted islands who thought the nice sailors only wanted to be friends.  But that's another story.  Derek will teach the kids what to do if they find a gun around the house.  What do we do first?  We pick it up.  Second?  Check is loaded.  Right.  Because we don't want any nasty accidents.  So look down the barrel and...  Pull the trigger.  Ah, through.  Yep, it's loaded, Henry. 
[01:49:30]  And you made a mess.  Next, carefully file off the serial number and conceal it quickly about your person.  Ammunation and Derek the Dodo have been proudly bringing gun safety to your community for over 30 years.  Ammunation.  Protecting your kids' rights.  Ammunation!  Sirius XM.  This is the OPN3 Show.  One of my favorite people, period. 
[01:50:00]  Jim Brewer in studio.  Where's little Jimmy?  Oh, working Jimmy.  Oh, he's got something working, something going on maybe.  I think he's got a combo.  I think he's got the Zach Wilde roast that he's taping.  He ended up doing it.  Yes, and then I think he's got some Jay Leno action.  That's big for Jimmy.  That's like a Make-A-Wish Foundation thing for Jimmy.  I'm getting to do the Zach Wilde roast?  They asked me to do the Zach Wilde thing like two months ago. 
[01:50:30]  And I had mixed feelings about Zach Wilde.  Oh, okay.  Here, I got a Zach Wilde story.  All right.  Zach Wilde called me while I was at Disney World, right?  It's out of the blue.  What?  That's the oddest thing that could happen right there.  Right.  That's stupid.  Right?  So, I'm in Disney World, the kids.  Jimmy!  Jimmy, you know who I am?  I'll meet you at it's a small world.  Meet me there.  It's Zach Wilde. 
[01:51:00]  I play guitar for Ozzy.  I play that.  And he's...  Wow.  These guys are auditioning over the phone.  So, he's playing guitar from a studio.  And he said, oh, me and you are going to make a TV show, a comedy show.  It's going to be comedy and rock.  It's going to be...  It's going to be Dave Chappelle, but rock!  All right.  Yeah.  So, this is a good three, four years ago.  All right.  So, I go, oh, okay. 
[01:51:30]  Nah, I'm not going to lie to you.  I know Ozzy after Randy Rhoads.  I don't go into, I always play guitar.  My days of checking on who's playing on bass and who's...  Right.  I'm done.  I get Ozzy.  At some point, you do have to stop doing that.  Right.  So, I'm not really sure who he is.  And people are like, oh, dude, he played for Ozzy.  All right.  So, I started talking to his people.  And they're like, are you interested in doing...  We're producing a sketch show.  And it's rock and it's Zach. 
[01:52:00]  I said, well, that's funny.  I've been toying with that idea for a while.  Blah, blah, blah.  Come out to LA.  No, first he wants to meet New York.  All right.  Meet New York.  What do you mean, meet New York?  He's going to meet with me so we can talk about this.  Meet in New York.  I thought he wanted you to take him around.  Meet New York.  This is what happens.  I want to call Meet New York.  So, he comes and he brings his wife.  And we meet at the Chinese joint. 
[01:52:30]  What is it?  Shun Li.  You know what Shun Li is?  Hai.  Hai.  There's a hundred of them.  No.  Only one Shun Li.  Only one Shun Li.  About five, ten minutes.  Five.  Mr. Cohen, a very nice man.  He live on Park Avenue.  Seinfeld 4.  All right.  All right.  I have to say them all.  Love that guy.  We're going Shun Li.  We go to Shun Li.  Here comes this guy. 
[01:53:00]  He looks like, I'm not even exaggerating.  He looks like an action figure.  He's about 6'4".  And he looks like a Hells Angel guy.  He's wearing boots with the Jude, like Rob Halford boots.  Leather pants, leather jacket with fringes, you know, death to anyone but white people jacket.  He's got a big American bandana around his head, and he's got an Opie beard, right? 
[01:53:30]  Longer than Opie.  Wow.  He's got a big, long, long beard.  Yeah, Zach's got it going.  So he's got his, and I'm like, this guy's a major rocker.  Okay.  We sit in the corner, and it's probably around noon.  And his wife, I'll never forget his wife's like, I want to make sure, no matter where we're going, that his image is protected.  What?  Because we, you know, he's got a kid and all this.  P.S., we're in, we're in, we're like five people in this whole place, and he's like, no, we're going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to shove it down with the sketches where you take chinks, and you shove them in a, in a black eyes rag, oh man, you, and you slice them up with a chainsaw. 
[01:54:00]  And he's, I mean, he's mother effing every time.  Mother effing.  And the Asians, I, we couldn't order for a half hour because they were afraid to come to the table. 
[01:54:30]  Wow.  I had a call that.  And his wife wants his image protected.  Yeah, she's worried about his image.  I just want to make sure people heard that part.  She's worried about his image.  Holy fuck, man.  So the whole time, I guess this guy's getting, meanwhile, he's pouncing Heineken's.  He's just IV and Heineken's.  So we end, and I talk to his producer, I listen, he's like, no, no, no, when it comes to filming, Zach is professional, he's amazing, he's this, he's that.  Okay, cut to, I fly to L.A. 
[01:55:00]  They fly me to L.A., we're going to some warehouse to film, and when I show up there, now we've got to be there at like 9 a.m.  All right, which is great for filming something.  Sure.  9 a.m.'s great, we're going to pick you up until 7 o'clock, we'll have a car, and we'll have a, great, life is, this is a real high, 10.30, 11 o'clock, 11.50.  No, he's going to be here, he's on the way, he's on, I, I swear to God, I'm not exaggerating. 
[01:55:30]  You hear, he hits the garbage pails, they go flying down the back alley.  He gets out of the car, and about a dozen Heineken bottles come crashing out, he slams the door, and he's like, he does the double metal horns up in the air, he's like, 
[01:56:00]  He's got a million chains, he's clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, he's, he's wasted out of his mind.  He grabs the producer, he's got one of these huge biker chains that are, that are good, a good four foot long, and it's something you would wrap around a bike.  Like, he grabs, I, I swear my children's lives, I'm not even exaggerating this, he's like, are we ready to work? 
[01:56:30]  And he grabs the guy by the head, puts him in a headlock, and wraps the chain around his neck.  What the fuck is he thinking?  He drops him to his knees, and he's pulling him, and he's choking the guy.  The guy's going, suck, suck, suck.  He's trying to tap out, suck.  He's like, this is what I'm talking about, Jimmy, we're going to get crazy, we're going to go, we're going to do things you've never seen on television. 
[01:57:00]  And he's choking the guy.  And he's choking the guy with a chain?  And so now I know I'm a prisoner for the next two hours, I don't know what.  So he's choking him, he finally lets it go, and the guy can't breathe, he's like, he's sitting, he's dry heaving.  What a fucking lunatic.  And while he's doing it, he's got a piece of paper, he's going, all right.  The first sketch, we've got to get inside, because we're already behind production. 
[01:57:30]  He still can't talk.  Holy shit.  Now he goes into the studio, and he starts playing, and he's telling about Ozzy and his new CD.  And we're not filming nothing.  About one o'clock, he's like, Jimmy, time out.  We're going to go take a ride.  Oh, no.  So, yeah, the producer, he gets the producer, we get in a truck, and I'm thinking we're filming on location stuff.  I get in the truck, in the back, producer gets in, Zax gets in.  He makes us go to this place that's a strip place. 
[01:58:00]  Oh, no.  And now he's in a strip place, it's like a Long Island way out in the middle of Ronkonkoma.  Yeah, when I was like 17.  So, go there, and I'm mortified, so I'm just in the parking lot.  Like, what's going on?  What are we doing?  What are we doing?  He's the only one in the place, and we can't get him out now.  So, he says, can you just bring me back? 
[01:58:30]  Just bring me back.  Yeah, yeah, I'm done with this.  So, they end up bringing me back.  We can't get him out of the place.  He shows up.  About an hour later, he slams into the craft table.  Knocks over everything.  Everything in the craft table.  And he's got his head out of the way, he's going, everyone, get out, film this, film this, film this.  Now he knows what's good.  And now here's his closer. 
[01:59:00]  He gets up on the top of his truck, and he starts urinating on the windshield and on the hood.  And, yeah, that was my last experience.  And then there was a good friend of mine that I know that he invited on his bus, all right?  And when he went on his tour bus, the guy was like, you know, I changed my life, and I'm sober now.  And he went right in his face.  Holy shit. 
[01:59:30]  So, I lost all respect for Zach Wild.  Wow.  So, when they asked me to do it, I went, you know what, man, no, I don't think I'd have good emotions spewing out.  Right.  But from what I heard now, he has officially turned the corner, and he's feeling better.  I hear, just for the record, that he's clean now.  I heard he's clean.  I heard he had to stop drinking for health reasons.  I would imagine so, because he was a disaster. 
[02:00:00]  A disaster.  And he had a kid.  And he has a small child, man.  He's got to step up, Hammer.  Sounds like he's on the road to a ruin van.  Where's the video that you guys shot?  The little...  I'm not even gonna...  Who knows?  Who knows?  I don't even want to...  I don't even want to...  They try to hunt me down for months.  Like, you want to release this?  Jim's dead.  Jim Brewer, as we know, I think he's...  Yeah, nah, he's gone.  His son's now doing the legacy. 
[02:00:30]  He's moved on.  So that's where Jimmy is.  That's funny.  Wow, man.  Yeah, Jimmy's in L.A. doing that.  That's fucked up.  And other things, so...  But good for Jimmy.  That's fucking funny, man.  Well, Jimmy loves all of them.  It's, you know...  Well, yeah, he's a rock guy.  It's an infatuation.  Yes, he's infatuated with the rock world.  And that's good.  That's good.  I'm gonna have some...  He'll be excited.  I'm sure there'll be some good festivals coming in the summer.  A lot of pictures.  Jimmy will be taking pictures with celebrities.  That's right.  He loves that. 
[02:01:00]  So, uh...  Oh, brother.  When I heard you were coming in today, very excited, obviously.  Someone was telling me you've got a great story about your pops.  Oh, no.  This never ends.  This really never ends.  Your dad, obviously, is getting up there.  85, I think, at this point.  Nine.  He's 89.  Nine.  Give me 89.  Wow, man.  89.  Yeah, he lives in a house.  I think I lost a couple years there.  You did lose a couple years.  Wow, 89.  89.  God bless him.  But he's living with you because of the whole mom-dad thing. 
[02:01:30]  Yes.  Which now my eyes are opening up wider.  Wow, I thought they were fucking...  They were already saucers.  And they were already saucers.  Now they're, like, the cartoon...  Yeah.  The cartoon kind of...  Giant eyes.  When they bounce out.  Yeah, yeah.  Anime.  Got the anime eyes.  You're probably...  I should check this out.  You're probably figuring out that they're both the problem.  Well, here's...  Now, first of all, the last month, I have nurses that come and they get my dad out of bed. 
[02:02:00]  And they'll stay with him.  They're like, one, I'll make him breakfast or whatever.  And then he takes a nap for three hours.  And then they put him in bed at eight o'clock, come back at four, get him out of his nap.  Does he have anything officially?  A disease or...  Early stages of Alzheimer's or something?  Congestive heart failure, a little bit.  Not Alzheimer's.  He's got dementia.  Right, okay.  But this is another thing.  Like, I don't know if he plays a game. 
[02:02:30]  There's times when he's so with it and I know he's with it.  And there's other times...  Here, I put on a George Carlin.  He loves George Carlin.  So I put on George Carlin.  I never hear him laugh.  And there was this one section where Carlin goes, I love getting old.  He goes, I like pretending I don't know nothing.  I pretend I'm senile just so I can fuck up.  And my dad went, ha ha!  Oh, shit!  Uh-oh.  And that's the only thing he laughed hard at. 
[02:03:00]  Uh-oh.  Now you're thinking, what the fuck, man?  Yeah, I'm like, what's going on with this guy?  Yeah.  Well, the last month, we have a girl that's really good to him.  Takes him out.  She takes him for breakfast.  But he's been getting really sexually ornery.  Oh, no.  So to the point...  At 89.  Yeah.  He makes...  First, he makes like these psychotic faces.  Like horny guy faces?  Yeah.  Worse, more like, I'm going to get your face. 
[02:03:30]  Like, eh.  But he can't because he's wheelchip out.  There's no easier.  Eh, I got to get your...  Now this started...  We came out to Long Island for a wedding about a month ago.  It was right after Thanksgiving.  And we brought a nurse out there.  She was in a room with him.  Wife and I were in another room.  Uh-oh.  He has his own bed.  He can't even get out of bed.  He needs help getting out of bed and in a bed.  Jeez. 
[02:04:00]  She goes...  It was the night...  Very early in the morning.  She's like, Jimmy...  Uh-oh.  Mr. Jimmy...  Uh-huh.  He...  He scared me last night.  Oh, no.  So what happened?  I put him in bed.  And...  Um...  I...  I don't know how this happened.  He...  In bed, I put cover.  I put pillows so he not can fall and get out.  I feel somebody hand on me.  I look up.  He...  He getting in my bed.  He got out of his bed.  Whoa. 
[02:04:30]  Walk in the dark to my side.  Open.  He said, I come in bed with you.  I said, no, no.  You...  No, no.  I marry.  You go back in bed.  No, no.  She said, he then sat up all night.  Every time I'd wake up and I'd look, he was just sitting up staring at me.  He...  He'd scare me.  So I talked to him.  He's like, I remember that.  I remember that.  Then she said, he apologized to me.  He say, sorry.  But he won't...  To me, he goes, I remember that. 
[02:05:00]  I remember that.  I remember that.  Like a bird.  What happened?  I remember that.  I remember that.  What happened?  No recollection.  No recollection.  So it's starting to build up.  But now when these nurses come, he gets this...  First, he starts with the face.  And they say, hey, hey, hey, relax.  They know just from the face that he's...  Oh, you'll know it, Ann.  And you'll see the face.  He gets this cynical...  What would I like to do to you?  Oh, my God. 
[02:05:30]  It's really...  It's borderline disturbing.  Yeah.  But then he starts...  Like, she'll be sitting across from him playing a card game.  She lifts...  He'll lift his leg and trying to play footsie with her.  And you're like, come on, man.  You're 90.  Relax.  Like, cut it out.  She's 30.  Then he tries to...  He does copper feels.  You know, if they're freaking...  If they're taken out of bed, he'll go for an ass cheek.  He'll go for...  He does copper feels.  You know what's fucked up?  I totally get away with it.  Exactly.  Yeah, it's great.  To get away with it. 
[02:06:00]  And that's what I'm thinking.  Yeah, like, hey.  This is what I'm not...  So, this is going on.  And she tells me...  She's like, oh, yeah, you know, he's...  He's very...  And then she's saying...  And she's telling me, you know, I think he...  I think...  You know, I come in this morning and his...  His pampers were undone.  Oh, no.  And he was wet and it wasn't pee-pee.  I went...  I said, you know what, man?  I don't know.  Oh, man.  I said, I don't know if I'm buying this.  I really don't know if... 
[02:06:30]  Oh, man.  You know, the chick is also in the...  You know, lawsuits and this going on.  You just don't know...  Yeah, yeah.  ...who...  What's going on?  And, like, am I...  Should I get a lawyer?  Is this the beginning of a setup?  What's going on here?  So, Friday, he's being really bad.  And I'm five feet from him.  So, I hear her going, Mr. Brewer, that's your first warning.  Two...  No more.  I turn around, what are you doing?  I catch him with the hands and the legs and he's trying. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, my God.  Now, the third time she says no...  Now, I used to live in Florida and they had a chimp farm.  And the chimp farm, the chimps were so horny that they would just hold the cages and they'd  have their little...  And they'd shake back and forth like nuts out of control, rocking back and forth.  He's in the wheelchair, shaking back and forth like a...  At the chimp farm?  Yes.  And he can't control himself. 
[02:07:30]  So, he said, all right, done with you.  You got to go downstairs.  Now, it's also...  It's 1230.  One o'clock's nap time.  So, she helps him down the stairs, puts him in the bathroom.  She comes up and she's saying, which I don't really believe, she said, he was so excited.  Oh, no.  He started drooling and shaking.  And she's going, look at my arm.  He drooled on me.  He was so...  He was shaking.  He was so excited.  Is she hot, by the way? 
[02:08:00]  Just for the visual?  She's not...  She's not...  To an eight, nine-year-old man, she's a 10.  She's an attractive girl.  She's all right, though.  Okay.  She's not an ugly girl.  She's an attractive girl.  I mean, you know...  Okay.  I'm just wondering what an 89-year-old looks at.  She's not a...  To find attractive.  She's an attractive...  I can see where the excitement comes from.  Gotcha.  Now, with that said, she's now doing...  You know, she's doing his clothes and stuff like that.  And we're in the kitchen and she's going, you know, I can see why your mother might have 
[02:08:30]  been mad and might have been frustrated because that is frustrating.  He doesn't even...  He's just...  He's getting gross.  And when I agree, I'm starting to wonder what's going on here.  So, about five minutes later, she goes down and she also said when she put him on the  toilet to go to the bathroom, he had a raging one going on.  So, now I'm talking, I'm like, can you do it at that?  She's like, oh, you don't know. 
[02:09:00]  Nursing homes, they do it with each other.  I'm like, what?  What?  We let them finish, blah, blah.  About five minutes later, she comes upstairs.  Mr. Jimmy, he's having a stroke.  So, I go run downstairs.  Now, when he sits on the toilet, she lights a candle because the smell is horrifying.  Lights up my whole bottom of the stair.  Oh, wow.  He destroys...  It's borderline dry heaving.  It's borderline dry heaving.  So, he lights a candle, he's passed out on the toilet, but he's doing convulsions. 
[02:09:30]  Oh, shit.  Yeah, his head's going back.  I've seen this before, so I'm not freaking out, but I do think this is it.  I think he's having a heart attack, honestly.  Whoa.  Because he's shaking and having convulsions, and he's passed out to the point where the  candle is burning his hair and doesn't feel it.  Holy fuck.  So, I smell the burning.  I'm like, oh, all right.  So, I'm lifting him up.  He's, you know, hair syringing.  The girls are calling 911. 
[02:10:00]  My wife's calling 911.  The nurse is calling.  I said, Dad, look at me.  Look at me.  He can't...  His eyes are flickering.  I says, Dad, look at us.  Give me orange juice.  Give me...  I'm putting cold heat.  Nothing.  And I said, all right.  This is it.  This is...  Jesus.  I'm ready for this.  This is...  I've been waiting for this for a while.  We're good to go.  He starts coming to a little bit.  Dad, you okay?  You all right?  All right. 
[02:10:30]  He's out.  Paramedics show up.  And just then, I see the DNA.  Um, he basically pulled himself and whacked himself into a coma.  Oh, holy shit.  So, wait a minute.  Holy fuck.  You've got to be kidding me.  I swear on my kids' lives.  So, he whacked himself to the point where he shot into orbit and he couldn't recover. 
[02:11:00]  Holy shit.  So, that must have felt great.  That's what I say.  Man, if you're sitting there, eyes fluttering and you just can't move with your hairs on  fire, what a great orgasm.  Holy shit.  That's the ultimate, right?  That's fucking heaven.  You should go after that.  What's there to live for after that? 
[02:11:30]  Wow.  Dude.  That's fucking crazy.  That's fucking crazy.  He's just taking his life.  So, sit down.  Holy fuck.  I don't know how to explain it.  Wait, is it on him?  It's on his legs.  The aftermath is on him?  On his legs.  Oh, my God.  She's clean.  She's clean.  She's like, it's in, you know.  Oh, my gosh.  He did that.  I went.  So, now, first the cops show up.  Oh, shit.  All right.  What's going on here, Jimmy?  I think we just found out what happened. 
[02:12:00]  He whacked until he went into orbit.  And he just put his hands up in the air.  He's like, I'll wait for the medics to show up.  I really don't need to know about this.  He leaves every, every, like, in my town, you call an ambulance, 40 cars show up.  Yeah.  Everyone that walked in there laughed harder than the next person.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  But they couldn't get him up.  He was completely incoherent.  And we had to send him to the hospital.  So, he goes to the hospital. 
[02:12:30]  You know, and the ER people are like, so what's the problem?  Oh, well, get a load of this.  Well, here's the problem.  Speaking of getting a load, getting a load of this.  You're not going to believe this one.  Turns out he just needs a cigarette.  Fuck.  So, well, here's what was more disturbing.  Now, I tell my mom.  Let's see if I can find the text.  I tell my mom, but I didn't want to tell her what happened.  I didn't want to make her mad or nothing. 
[02:13:00]  Listen, so, with that said, my sister, I go, Mom, you know, Dad went in the hospital.  Oh, what's going on?  Ah, you know, he passed out.  Oh, okay.  My sister sends me a text going, I'm with Mom, and I just told her she's laughing hysterically.  She said, Dad does that all the time.  Jesus.  Holy shit.  I would imagine that's what heroin would be. 
[02:13:30]  I guess so.  But I'm just, and my mom's like, you're so naive.  Why would you be so naive to just think all that ends or whatever?  Well, I don't know.  Who would think of that?  True.  Yeah, who's kind of, I would think your noodle just stays soft after a while.  I do, too.  Like, there's no way you can be, you know, excited or have your spirits lifted.  In a state.  Yes, in that state. 
[02:14:00]  Of arousal.  Yeah, this is, I'm, arousal.  Arousal.  So this is the beginning of, I'm sure, many interesting scenarios that'll happen in my  father's bedroom.  So now I know, always don't stick him in a, don't stick him in a bathroom, stick him  in a bed.  This is where I ain't gonna worry about it.  Yeah, he'll just be laying down.  Let him go out.  Was it a blood pressure thing?  Yes.  The blood pressure just dropped.  Dropped.  Plummeted.  And his head went right to his dick.  Plummeted.  Holy shit. 
[02:14:30]  Plummeted.  And I don't know, should I, he's so bad with the nurses.  I really thought about snipping him.  You know what he needs?  He needs the fucking, like, the G-suits that the fighter pilots wear, where it squeezes,  it squeezes the blood out of their legs to keep it in their head when they're pulling,  pulling fucking nine G's.  He's pulling nine G's on his dick, and you gotta fucking keep the blood in his head.  Put a hole in the crotch so he can still enjoy himself.  And then, and then I'll have the noises that...  The blood is rushing out of his head. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, hands on deck.  Oh, hands on deck.  We've been hit.  We've been hit.  Pull up.  Pull up.  The rain.  The rain.  Pull up.  Pull up.  That's funny, man. 
[02:15:30]  That's what's going on in his head.  Oh, man.  Fucking great.  Holy shit.  How do you make that one up?  Yeah, and how do you, now how do you fucking deal it?  I guess you just put him in bed.  Well, he's been mortified since then.  Oh, has he?  Yeah, he's like a sheepish dog.  Which means he's unaware.  He's aware.  Of course he's aware because...  If he's mortified by that, then he's way more aware than you realize.  He is more aware because whenever he's with the girls, the minute I walk in the room,  he sheepishly stops and he looks over his shoulder to see where I am to make sure I'm not looking.  Looking at... 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, looking.  And there's one other nurse that he doesn't play with.  That's not as attractive.  No.  So I'm like, I wonder if that's...  She might be too American, too.  Because I'm dealing with nurse aides and stuff that come to your house and if they  speak a really foreign, dirty language...  Dirty language!  Like really broken, knocked by, kind of...  They will treat your loved one great.  Yeah, like it's their own.  But if they're educated, they went to nursing school, oh boy.  They don't want nothing to it.  Yeah. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, wow.  You need a dirty foreigner to take care of your fucking parents.  You're right.  I'm telling you, we had one for a while and this one barely spoke English, broken English,  and she fucking treated my mom like she was the queen.  Right.  And she's had it the other way where they're like, ah, fuck this.  You're right.  Oh, because if they are...  Trinidad.  Trinidad's a good one.  Oh, Trinidad's great.  They're like straight from heaven.  Anything from Texas down...  Forget it.  Yeah.  That's good. 
[02:17:00]  They're going to take care of it.  They're heavenly human beings.  Yes.  Any American, forget it.  Because they...  A nurse aide from Jersey, forget about it.  Forget about it.  Forget it.  We would...  Any American we had, like a real American we've had, will sit there and just text and almost  look like...  It's a burden.  Yeah.  And I feel uncomfortable in my house.  Yeah, they text the whole time.  They just sit next to your father just texting.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  These...  They do here a lot.  Here.  Ooh.  Here.  Here.  Right.  Here.  Here.  I want water here. 
[02:17:30]  Here.  Ah.  Okay, ready for nap?  Oh, man, I mean...  Let's take a nine-hour nap.  But that sounds great.  The Trinidad...  I could use that.  The Trinidad still get in the shower with your mama and make sure everything...  Scrub up.  And everything is washed properly.  Yeah.  They'll get right in there, man.  They feel like they need to do a proper job.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  He knows.  I know.  He knows.  It's good stuff, man.  So, yeah, that's my world.  That's a great story.  Are you telling that one on stage?  You know what?  No, I don't know how to do the... 
[02:18:00]  Well, I don't know yet.  I don't know yet.  That one's got you told.  That's a story.  Yeah.  It's a story.  That's what I love about your comedy.  The stories.  I'm going to do a story night.  I'm going to do stand-up and then a story night.  I got plenty of stories.  I love when you do stories.  That'd be a good story night.  That and the ten best cities my dad has crapped himself.  That's my next tour.  That's a one-man show.  Yeah.  Can we get into that after the break?  Like, I want to hear about the cities, the top ten cities your dad has crapped.  Oh, my gosh. 
[02:18:30]  I told Brewer before the show, it's got to be a coffee table book.  Oh, yeah.  His fans would fucking buy that in a second.  Why is this smell so bad?  Is it medication, just medical stuff?  I don't know if it's the age, the diet, the meds, whatever it is.  It's a whole...  It's horrifying.  Conglomeration of...  I think because pieces of your colon are actually now leaving your body with every shift.  Oh, God.  When you walk in through my...  You come through my garage and there's a lower room where he lives in, and then you 
[02:19:00]  walk up a couple steps and that's the main house.  Because that whole bottom floor is out of commission when he goes to the toilet.  It's just...  You can't go near...  It's like a wall as you go down the second step.  Stenches out the whole fucking...  Destroys the place.  You've got to light a million candles.  Wow.  It's horrifying.  Bravo.  Yeah, good stuff.  You look forward to this?  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  This is for you, Ed.  No, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, I know.  I'm on the brink.  I see you retiring.  You need to go to an island. 
[02:19:30]  You need to live on an island.  Yeah, I would like that.  I'd like an island with a castle on it.  You can buy...  You've got some cash.  Yeah, a couple of shekels.  There's a few islands you'd probably...  Maui right now?  Yeah.  You can get sick property in your range right now.  Good, good, yeah.  Really good property.  All the gun laws there.  And you...  I like shooting.  You can get enough property, it's your lamp.  I want to shoot fish.  What about Thousand Islands? 
[02:20:00]  You go up near Thousand Islands, right?  Which Thousand Islands?  I don't know.  A lot of islands.  It's up there.  On the St. Lawrence River, right?  East coast or west coast?  Which Thousand Islands?  It's up, like, north.  North, I don't know.  Ah, it's too cold up there.  It is too cold.  I don't want to be in the cold.  He needs warm.  He needs warmth.  Oh, my joints will be aching.  But people all own individual islands up there.  My arthritis will kick in.  Thousand Islands is fucking awesome, and I don't want the cold.  I'd love to see Ant as an old man. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, my God.  Well...  Sitting there in a hammock.  Wait a few weeks.  I'm ready.  I'm fucking feeling worse every day.  I was talking about how my fucking eyes feel like Arnold Schwarzenegger in Total Recall  when he flew out the window every morning, because I'm trying to read my tweets without  glasses, and the pain, it's a muscle pain, like my eyes were doing fucking chin-ups.  It's a literal muscular pain that exercise gives your fucking muscles that shouldn't work 
[02:21:00]  that hard.  You know the muscles?  And it's literally the muscles that work your lenses.  Your eyeball lenses.  They don't just stay the same shape.  They've got to focus on things.  So there's muscles on the sides, on the edges, and they pull and misshape your lens until  they're pulling and squeeze in.  These muscles now have got to look like fucking, like a bodybuilder's arms.  I can flex.  I can flex my fucking lens muscles, because they do nothing all day but pull my fucking 
[02:21:30]  lens tight, because I can't see, god damn it.  I've got to tell Brewer, you picked a great day to come in, it's a sad day for Opie and  Anthony.  We both increased our font size today on our phones.  We both had to finally increase the size of the fonts in our messages and tweeters.  On your phone, you can increase your font size.  This shows you where I'm at.  I don't even know what a font is.  Font is how big your letters are.  It's your letters.  Oh!  For your eyes!  Yes.  Oh, wow.  But there's a setting on your phone, and today, it's a sad day.  We both upped our font sizes. 
[02:22:00]  Dude, look at the size of my text message.  Let me see that again.  It takes up half the screen.  I have literally three texts.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah, that's insanity.  What are you?  You can't read that one, Ant?  What are you, an ant?  What are you, a fly?  That's how they should do the eye test.  I can't see.  To show you individual phones.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Far away?  Yeah, but didn't you do the laser?  I did.  No, Opie did. 
[02:22:30]  And you're having problems with your eyes off?  They said when you get in your 40s that, you know.  And when you get in your 40s.  Well, I mean, it's been a couple years now.  Being a child of the 80s like Opie.  But your eye muscles, like I was just talking about, they get weaker with the middle age  there, and now I kind of need them to drive at night.  I promise my wife.  I can see that, too.  I promise my wife is the kid.  Glare?  I can't even see the fucking other cars.  See, night's not a problem, and distance isn't a problem.  It's all reading for me.  And they give me fucking copy like this, and I'm like, I can't remember. 
[02:23:00]  I go home, and my eyes are so fucked up and hurting, and I'm dizzy from that.  I feel like I have the flu when I read.  When I read, it gives me the flu.  But a few beers take care of that.  You are going to be the funniest old man I've ever seen in my life.  Oh, I'll be crotchety.  You are going to be so funny.  And it would be Bob Grant.  Yeah, yeah.  You would be like a Bob Grant guy.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Jim Brewer, what are we promoting?  I know you came in.  I'm doing Levity Live.  It's a brand-new opening.  I think there's some tickets left for Friday. 
[02:23:30]  Where is this joint?  It's Palisades.  It's brand-new.  Palisades, New York, brand-new Levity Live.  You can probably go to LevityLive.com.  It's Gotham Comedy Club.  They open up this place, and they're going to start a whole new chain.  And it's like a kick-ass improv club.  So when is this?  This weekend?  This weekend.  Friday and Saturday.  I'm not sure how many tickets are left.  I know one or two of the shows are sold out. 
[02:24:00]  Friday, early show, one of those deal.  Can I go?  Yeah.  How far is it from City?  Yeah.  I'm going to say less than an hour.  It's at the Palisade Center in West Nyack.  There you go.  West Nyack.  Perfect.  There you go.  I want to go.  Well, come on down.  I think I might go.  Yeah, let's check it out.  I'm working on the new hour.  What day?  I'm filming the new hour.  Let's go.  Friday or Saturday?  I'm working on that new hour.  You got a PokÃ© in Friday?  Yeah, I got a PokÃ© in me.  I'm not going to get in and out of the city.  I'll go.  I haven't seen Brew in a while.  I would love to go to this.  I'm going to Red Eye tomorrow. 
[02:24:30]  All right.  How do they do the tickets again?  I have no clue.  Go to West.  Go to LevityLive.com or something.  I love Brewers plugs.  I don't know.  Go to my website.  Go to JimBrewer.com.  It's all on JimBrewer.com.  You guys come in here and you do us a favor.  You give us great radio and then it's time to get something out of it.  Oh, look at that.  None of these guys know how to plug.  Grand opening weekend.  Grand opening.  And they used my right picture.  They used big pictures, too.  You look a little sultry in that picture.  You know what?  I picked the picture. 
[02:25:00]  You look a little, you know, like a movie star.  That's what I'm shooting for.  Yeah.  That's what I'm shooting for.  I want that pilot.  You don't have that pilot.  I'll give me that chance to get up the bat.  You don't have marijuana eyes in that picture.  No, I don't.  You're looking good.  Because I made him take the shot from down.  Ah.  I was working out.  I was running.  Why the fuck aren't you on TV?  You look like you could be in a major motion picture.  And then you go to the next picture.  And then you got that one.  Yeah, that one looks like a film guy.  That's not bad.  I look like a film guy.  Both pictures are good.  Why aren't you on TV, bro?  That's just stupid.  I'm working on it.  It's stupid you're not on TV, though. 
[02:25:30]  I'm working on it.  All right.  Very, very.  I'm close.  You know what I'm in?  I'm almost in the semifinals.  Oh, okay.  It's close to that.  So here's how it goes.  It goes to get into the development stage is sort of like the playoffs.  Hey, you made it to the playoffs.  Now you got to get it to the script stage.  Now you're in the top eight.  Now to get it to the pilot is like the semifinals. 
[02:26:00]  The Super Bowl is on air.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm in the semifinals.  You're right there.  So I got to film that pilot and then hopefully, you know.  Let's keep our fingers crossed.  Hopefully win the Super Bowl.  It's a great premise and all that.  What network?  Or you don't want to see anything?  ABC.  Oh, man.  Jesus.  We'll never see you again.  Oh, really?  Right.  It's been fun, though, all this year.  You'll have to come out to L.A.  And actually would be the funniest best friend guy on the show.  I would love that.  You would. 
[02:26:30]  You are that guy.  Oh, man.  I'll audition.  You are that guy.  That's frightening.  Yeah, we're just about done with this.  It's perfect timing.  Seriously?  It is frightening.  Oh, man.  You laugh so hard.  Yeah.  I'll talk to you off air what it is.  You'll howl at the character.  Howl at him.  Would you have to move to L.A.?  Most likely, I already told him.  I'm ready.  Ready to go.  My wife made me crack out last night because forever, we're like, we never leave an East 
[02:27:00]  Coast.  Last night, she's like, you know, forget the sitcom.  Yeah.  Um, let's do this for that one and let's do that and let's get, let's get out of here.  I'm like, yeah.  She's ready to fucking go.  Me too.  Bye, everybody.  Bye-bye.  We had a nice run.  Enjoy the future.  We'll see you in a decade.  I'm out.  Yeah.  I never thought I'd say that, but I think I know I'm ready. 
[02:27:30]  You're ready for a change.  Yeah.  If it happens, I'm ready.  I'll keep my jersey home, but I'm ready to go.  You'll have your home jersey.  Just get different homes everywhere.  Keep the jersey one.  That'd be great.  Oh, yeah.  Make all the other employees around here jealous.  God, I hope it happens for you.  Me too.  All right.  More with Jim Brewer.  Stay there.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul.  Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy staring.  Yeah.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here. 
[02:28:00]  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, because here comes Uncle Paul.  We should say I had to make a big boy love you.  In today's episode, Uncle Paul remembers babysitting a young Opie.  You remember.  I used to babysit you.  I'd poke my you-know-what through the crib, and you'd grab it.  He was a little blue-eyed Gregorio.  He was the cutest one.  Yeah.  I told you. 
[02:28:30]  Him and his brother would play the game.  The peenie flip.  I'd say, go ahead, flip your peenie.  Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.  Sure.  And his mother would take pictures.  Take pictures when he was in the tub.  Yeah, and then the court said she had to leave, so she went with a Jewish fella.  I'd kiss his shoulders real tender.  And I'd say, this is what happens.  The man puts it in.  I'm going to fertilize you.  I'm going to show you how we start life.  Push back a little bit.  Come on, eat your ice cream and push back. 
[02:29:00]  Show Uncle Paul you want a baby.  I'm going to make you pregnant.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy stare.  Uncle Paul.  And now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, because here comes Uncle Paul.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Network, it's the Jim Norton No Request Show.  That's me, Jim Norton, folks. 
[02:29:30]  Play some Grateful Dead, man.  Jerry Garcia sat on a stool.  He was awful.  Dude, can you play some Winnie Crabbit?  Come on, stop.  Walks around with his dumb shades, and he's a hipster, and he stinks.  You request it.  Chances are he hates it.  Other bands are boring.  Nirvana.  Shout it, you dope.  Led Zeppelin.  Garbage.  You too.  I hate bandwagon bands like you two.  They're going to sit there and preach politics.  It's all Ozzy all the time.  One of the best live performers on earth.  He's dyslexic.  It doesn't matter.  He's a maniac on stage.  That's the beauty of him. 
[02:30:00]  Remember, if Ozzy didn't sing it...  One word answer.  Awful.  Awful.  You stink horrible.  My boyfriend's going to kill us both unless you play Limp Bizkit.  So what?  Let him do it.  Oh, brother.  Weekday mornings from 3 to 3.15.  Fine.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  All right. 
[02:30:30]  We'll see you next time. 
[02:31:00]  Sirius XM.  This is the O-T-N-A-T-E Show. 
[02:31:30]  Ding, ding, ding.  I like this song.  I don't think we're going to get to hear this song, though.  No.  I'm thinking we have to talk here, right?  Yeah.  Jim Brewer is just killing it for us.  Jim's great.  And he threw down his microphone and he just walked down the hall.  So, I don't know.  He might be done.  That's how he rolls.  He rolls nice.  I think he'll be back, though.  Hey, I'm nominated for a Shorty Award.  You remember those?  I was nominated for a Shorty Award.  But you remember those when Eastside Dave tried to win one and embarrassed himself on stage? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  We're all nominated, though.  I'm nominated for it.  What are you nominated for?  For greatness.  It's got to be something.  All right.  I'll show you.  I don't just bullshit.  What's your Shorty Award?  For Web Show.  Ooh.  So, I guess you go to what?  Shorty Award.  And everyone's.  See, look.  Shorty votes.  Shorty Awards.  Opin Radio.  You were nominated by Holly and St. Pete for a Shorty Award in YouTube Star.  Wow.  Oh. 
[02:32:30]  That's exciting.  Yeah.  Well, I'm Web Show.  Yeah, but you know what?  A little company called YouTube.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  What's going on?  Shorty Awards.  Shorty Awards.  Apparently, you know, greatness are nominated.  Both of us are.  Both of us in different categories.  Not even for our radio show.  Yeah, not even for radio.  For our solo projects.  Really?  I nominate Anthony Cumia for Shorty Award in Hashtag Web Show.  Nice.  Because he's my boss.  That's what Sam just put in there.  Well, Sam, what about me? 
[02:33:00]  Do you do one for me now?  You're next.  Thank you, Sam.  Thank you, Sam.  So, vote for.  I don't know.  Is there a lot of nominees?  Am I missing?  There seems to be a lot of nominees.  Oh, all right.  Seems like 5,000 nominees.  Yeah, everyone.  So, maybe I can get nominated.  You should.  Yeah, Brewer should be nominated.  Brewer should be nominated for his webisodes.  My webisodes.  Webisodes.  Well, but I'm a web show.  I told Brewer after his last appearance, he did this fucking thing for Christmas, the  30 days of Christmas, where he worked his entire town, and he's going into the FedEx 
[02:33:30]  office and the local coffee shop and the local bar, and every day was a different character.  It was fucking brilliant.  And people were like, I loved Johnny.  What are you talking about?  Your website.  Your thing.  Your characters.  Your thing.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, I forgot I did it.  The old lady.  He's got a cougar character.  A cougar character.  It's all variations of my family, really.  It's hilarious, man.  Thanks, man.  And every day was different.  I think you did 30 of them, right? 
[02:34:00]  I did 25 or 26 of them.  Oh, right, because leading up to Christmas.  So, 25 of them.  It was great.  The character development, man.  But you had to tell I first started doing characters, I believe it was eighth grade in Mr. Neiman's class.  We should find one where we could actually play that, where the audio would make sense.  Because I know it's a video, but you had to take over the businesses for a few hours.  Yes, we would do it super early in the morning when Noam was there.  Right.  Matter of fact, I should put on one where... 
[02:34:30]  You got one that we could play for everybody?  I really...  One that might just translate well to radio?  We watch a lot of videos in this show, but maybe this one should.  Maybe the guy who...  Maybe the guy...  I don't know.  I'd have to figure it out.  Maybe the guy that had his dead dog dug up.  Yes.  That one made me laugh hard.  Yes.  Only because it was semi-true.  We just buried a cat.  And all the kids in the neighborhood were like, where'd you bury the cat?  Oh, shit.  I'm like, I'm not stupid. 
[02:35:00]  I remember being a kid that's...  Yeah.  For some reason, you have this fatuation like, oh, did you hear?  Sure.  I'm going to put up videos where I was torching my dad the last couple days.  Oh, good.  Yeah, you make really good videos.  Brewer, I don't know...  They're like home videos that are sticking on there.  I don't know if you promote them well, because these things should be doing way better than  they do.  I don't promote them.  I just put them up for my Facebook page.  They're fucking funny, man.  Funny shit.  You know what's funny?  The one with the kids in the garage, and they're beating the snot out of me. 
[02:35:30]  You ever see that one?  I don't know if I saw that one.  You'll laugh pretty hard, though.  And it's like in kids' corner, and I gave the kids wiffle ball bats, and I really just  put helmets on them, and I set up a camera, and I knew eventually they'd start hitting  me.  So I just...  We did this whole thing as I'm a monster trying to get them, and it's pretty freaking...  It's belly laughing funny.  Oh, that's fine.  And I add a couple sound effects, bing, boing, boom, and it looks like a cartoon or whatever. 
[02:36:00]  All right.  You got that one?  But it wouldn't play well over the radio.  Oh, then forget it.  Yeah, no, I wouldn't play it over the radio.  All you hear is just a lot of this, ah, ping, bong, ah, ping, bong, bing, ricochet rabbit.  You're Jim Brewer on Facebook, right?  Mr. Ricochet.  Yeah.  B-R-E-U-E-R.  Check out some of Brewer's videos that he makes.  They're really, really good.  Pizza Man update.  A lot of people ask...  Oh, before that, though, really fast. 
[02:36:30]  Yes.  A lot of people are asking why you wouldn't get your dad, like, maybe an escort or something.  You know...  It had to enter your mind, at least.  It did.  I'm like, I'd be a liar if I said maybe...  Now, two things.  One is, I'm not going to exhaust myself searching and finding the right one that's not gutting him at the same time.  And, like, what really is he getting into?  You know, is there such thing as, like, a nurse's aide type that will be gentle and really take care of the situation? 
[02:37:00]  Or, you know, are you going to downtown Newark looking for, you know, one on a corner?  All of a sudden, there's a pimp outside your house waiting.  Right.  I get it.  Why is there a truck outside and their motor's running?  Who's parked it?  And another thing is, I would never let that in my house.  Right.  I got three kids.  I'm not letting anything near that in my neighborhood. 
[02:37:30]  So...  Yeah, you're in a tough spot.  You know, at the end of the day, I'll buy him a nice fluffy pillow.  There you go.  I'll put a little face on the pillow.  There you go.  And he'll be fine.  Maybe get him one of those fucking fake vaginas.  He put himself in a predicament.  Get him one of those fake vaginas.  I'm not even getting it.  What if my kids find it?  Like a fleshlight?  Yeah, what if my kids find it?  No, the one where it looks like a serial killer torso.  I know what you mean.  Oh, cut out the girl's vagina?  Yeah, but it's just the vagina and almost their hips.  Well, what...  I went all over the place thinking all that. 
[02:38:00]  You know what?  You put yourself in that predicament.  You should have seen that coming.  I understand.  You're right.  He should have seen that coming.  I take it as a lesson.  I'm not going to put myself in that predicament.  Well, where are we at with Pizza Man?  We're done.  Life has moved on.  He's moved on.  We've moved on.  All is well.  Really?  It's that simple.  Oh, okay.  Everyone's moved on.  I can read between the lines.  Life is good.  All right, good.  He's moved on.  I moved on.  Everyone should just move on.  He's moving his life on. 
[02:38:30]  I'm going to move my life on.  All is well.  Okay.  You can tell me off air because it seems like there's a great story there.  All is well.  All is well.  Okay.  Fair enough.  I really...  Fair enough.  He's not in my circle anymore.  I don't...  I have no worries.  Okay, good.  No worries whatsoever.  All right.  People were asking.  So there you go.  That chapter is closed.  Chapter is closed.  Pizza Man is all done.  All is good.  He's enjoying life.  I'm enjoying life.  Everything's great.  Everything's beautiful. 
[02:39:00]  Okay.  I wish him nothing but the best.  All right.  We got to milk what?  Another half hour?  No, no.  We're good.  All right, good.  No, we're good.  No, so...  I really want to play one of your videos.  All right.  With the characters because your characters are so over the top.  Let me see the 25 days...  Let's take a look quickly.  I don't even know how to work my own thing.  I know which guy there's...  You have the woman that has the big boobs that jogs around the neighborhood. 
[02:39:30]  It's just creepy that you know how to play these characters so well.  I know them all very well.  Because they're based on real people.  I think there's...  I don't think it would be my Facebook page.  Well, yeah, I guess it would be.  Maybe under videos.  Videos.  There's...  Maybe under video.  Where would you find it?  Wow, you don't know.  I don't even know.  They were all on YouTube.  They were on...  Maybe Brewtube.  Brewtube.  What?  Oh, here he goes.  All right. 
[02:40:00]  He's found the 25...  Day 25.  No, it's not the 25th day.  Look at my mom all dressed up.  No.  Just a bitch with my mom before she lost her one eye.  Oh, shit.  That was good, too, though.  You can't find...  Just all the videos so we could just quickly pick one.  No.  Yeah.  To me, that was my favorite one.  The guy with the...  I guess audio-wise, that would work.  Yeah.  The one with the guy digging up the cat in the backyard. 
[02:40:30]  And every fucking day, there was another one with just these crazy characters.  So what are you guys doing?  Am I allowed to...  How old are you guys official here?  What do you mean?  Like, we're serious in XM and where are we at?  All that happy horse shit.  Yeah.  Contract ends in October and I'll list to some...  So you got plenty of time.  Pretty impressive.  He found them.  Look at that.  He found them.  I don't think we're going to continue.  He found them.  He found the videos.  Go up.  Go up.  I'm not sure what this guy would say.  Go up.  Up video. 
[02:41:00]  The guy with the...  No.  I mean down.  Down.  He's the worst.  Sam is the worst at that.  No, you're the worst.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  Right there.  But look at the lady.  Look at the fucking cougar one.  Look at how he's dressed.  Day 16?  Yeah.  That was fast.  That's exactly...  Can we hear just a part of that?  That's exactly kind of what my sister...  Day 16 of the 25 days of Christmas.  All right.  This is decent to be jolly.  La la la la la la la la la la la.  It's like Riley's. 
[02:41:30]  I'm going to need a ride home tonight, Jim.  So, if you can add to life...  Because I'm not going to be able...  I can walk.  I always walk.  You look like a fucking old bitch.  You look like a cougar, yeah.  I'm tired of it all.  Can I tell you a secret?  I have problems.  There's a lot of things going on.  I've got to take a lot of things at home that I don't want to discuss. 
[02:42:00]  There's a lot of things in my private life that are private.  And one of them are...  I can't drive tonight.  Let's clear that.  That's the one fact we have going on.  You know how hard it is, too?  To be, like, G-rated?  Yeah.  Oh, right.  You just want to be like, fuck.  I love them to death.  And I also like having a break. 
[02:42:30]  And I should.  I like breaks.  And I...  This person's real.  I love Chris's time.  I'm going to buy him lots of presents.  And I'm also going to spend a lot of time away.  Because it's a lot.  It's a lot.  And...  I'm a good person.  I am a good person.  I'm a good person.  You know that.  You know that, yeah.  I'm a very good person. 
[02:43:00]  I can't drive home tonight.  He's going to have to drive me.  I can walk.  I'm walking.  This is what's crazy.  I don't blame her because she gets...  She goes far out there.  But I would do anything to save my marriage.  And if he doesn't like me going out, and...  I mean, what's wrong with six times a week?  I'm home on Sundays morning. 
[02:43:30]  I didn't watch any of these.  They're great.  Fucking funny, man.  Family's beautiful.  We're married.  You know what?  I'm walking.  I'm going to walk.  I, um...  I'm walking.  These people are...  Pause.  It was really...  You know what's weird is I'm basing it on people that I've hung out with. 
[02:44:00]  And even in that same exact area.  And it was so...  It was weird when they come up and they're like,  Oh my gosh, that one character is so funny.  And I'm looking at the person I'm doing.  Wow.  And I'm wondering if they're...  Oh, shit.  I'm wondering if they know I'm doing them.  They're not sure.  That's why they're...  Or they're not sure.  You know, she promised me I would never talk about her again.  But she's just radio gold, too. 
[02:44:30]  I have a family member who's sort of close to that, too.  But lives far away.  This person...  Here's another thing you can't make about family.  I don't know if you ever told me.  I'm with my...  I have a family member visiting from Florida.  All right?  Now, she's in her 50s, mid-50s, whatever.  Visiting from Florida.  Now, shows up.  She's usually had a couple at the airport or whatever. 
[02:45:00]  Now, we're going to dinner.  And we're going to have a family dinner or whatever.  Nice.  And this person's up to visit whatever kids...  Whatever the scenario.  We go to this nice place to have dinner in town.  And we sit down.  And in the middle of dinner, she goes, I'm meeting someone here tonight.  It's a family dinner.  Who are you meeting?  It's really close friends of mine. 
[02:45:30]  Who?  Who is...  I...  It's a man that I...  That we really enjoy each other.  Company.  Where'd you meet the person?  On the internet.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  That's...  Well, where...  Wait a minute.  So, what do you...  Where does this person live?  In New Jersey.  It's just juicy.  But you're in...  Like, how did you guys...  Have you ever physically met this person? 
[02:46:00]  No.  And it doesn't...  I've seen pictures.  And they've seen pictures of me.  And we've been talking.  And we're going to meet for a cocktail.  And while I'm sitting there with, like, you know, my kids and my mom and my dad.  Here comes this guy with a shirt, like a Lily, a 1970s Saturday Night Fever, straight out of the movie.  Chest hair, just stick it out. 
[02:46:30]  And he's looking around the restaurant.  And I go, look at this yo-yo, walking around, thinks he's going to a disco.  And he goes...  And he says, my...  He says, this person's nailed.  I'll call it Chelsea.  He's like, Chelsea?  And she's like, Ronnie?  This is the guy.  Pull it...  So now he's a stranger.  Just put, like, right in the middle of dinner.  Like, what?  Not even 20 minutes later.  I mean, dry, humping, sucking face at the bar. 
[02:47:00]  They just met.  And my...  Yes!  And now my...  Family dinner.  Fucking great.  Not after the dinner's over.  No.  So now my...  Now I have another family.  I'm going, well, what are we going to do?  We don't want anything.  We don't want her to get raved or something.  And I'm like, it's not my responsibility.  I'm going to take her to my house.  That's...  I would not bring a stranger out.  You want to bring him to the house?  Not yourself out.  Every 20 minutes, I'm going to call.  You need to come here.  They're probably doing it in my kitchen.  Man, this is a 50-something-year-old. 
[02:47:30]  This isn't an 18-year-old.  Right.  So, yes.  The 25 days of characters are based on very real characters.  Can we play the one you really like?  Yeah.  I don't know if it's going to...  I just like it from that one line.  I don't know.  Here we go.  Play this guy.  He's like a businessman.  Oh, I like this guy.  To me, this is a business guy who really, he makes money, but he's got no nads.  His wife overruns his life. 
[02:48:00]  And you can tell just by looking at him.  You know those business guys?  They're just like, I'm really going to check with the wife.  Yeah.  Of course you do.  Look at the other one, too.  Which one?  I don't know if we have time.  You playing like Norman Bates' mother right there.  Which old lady?  Yeah, all the way on the right.  Oh.  I don't even remember that one.  Let me hear 14.  Let me see if that gives me anything.  We'll tap out if it doesn't translate.  Yeah, if it stinks.  Hey, Jimmy.  How are you, pal? 
[02:48:30]  Oh, God.  These are good.  That's phenomenal.  Yeah, I just figured I'd go out for a little walk.  I'm wearing blue.  Because our dog loved blue.  Oh, his dog died.  He's not with us anymore.  I don't know if you heard, but the dog passed away.  You know, I haven't slept a whole lot between the dogs passing.  And the Ivanhoe place has been so loud.  I don't know what's going on there.  It's going to go there now.  See if it's going down.  But, yeah. 
[02:49:00]  The dog used to love watching Blue's Clues.  So me and Julian's family decided, let's all wear blue all week for the dog.  I had to go out and buy some clothes.  Oh, my God.  It wasn't a pretty ending.  I don't know if your dog ever deceased.  Sometimes they'd bring him to the vet, and we didn't want to do that.  So he pooped himself a couple times all over the floor.  Smell wasn't pretty, but part of nature. 
[02:49:30]  And, you know, cleaned it up.  A little dry heaving.  But I'm glad he died in the living room.  Buried him in the back.  And I didn't dig the hole deep enough.  And now the vultures and the rattoons got a hold of him.  And the whole rear end is all carved out.  You don't like seeing your dog that way.  I'll tell you that.  I know it's nature, but...  I know it's nature.  I know it's nature, but the whole backside is all carved out.  Yeah, he's a good dog.  He's a good dog. 
[02:50:00]  I don't even think about telling anyone, because I don't want a new dog or a puppy.  That's the last thing I need.  There's another thing dying right in front of me.  The kids are traumatized for another ten years.  Every time they wake up and they just see the color blue, they start sobbing.  And that's tough.  Tough, tough, tough.  It doesn't help.  I'm going to go see what's going on in Ivanhoe Place and see if anyone's got the dog's paws, 
[02:50:30]  because someone took the paws off.  Maybe it was some juvenile kids in Ivanhoe.  I don't know.  Enjoy your day, though.  Sun's out, and we've got to enjoy it while we can.  Merry Christmas, and good luck with the whole lighting business, kiddo.  Good seeing you.  Oh, blue.  That's so sad.  Damn, I'm going to have to watch these again.  You know what?  And that video only...  It's funny.  It's only got like 2,000 views.  It only has 2,000 views.  That's a sin.  I think if you put 25 Days of Christmas into YouTube, maybe Jim Brewer in the search as 
[02:51:00]  well, you'll find them.  It's unbelievable, your characters.  Thanks, man.  I like the one in the store.  The toy store?  Yeah.  The kid?  That creepy lady.  It was one of the first ones.  There's a toy store.  I haven't seen these in well over a year.  Or a candle store.  So now I'm trying to...  It might be that lady.  Yeah, right there.  The lady right there.  Yes, her.  You are so...  Wait, that one?  Yes.  Really?  Yeah, I guess...  The day four one. 
[02:51:30]  I guess Brewer's...  I hope he knows all these, man.  I saw all of them.  I saw every single one of these.  Yeah, he really did.  He knows them all, man.  He does know all of them.  Yeah, that lady.  That's fucking...  That one's crazy.  That's the one.  She's out of her mind.  You're walking through a toy store.  Obviously, Brewer doesn't talk in any of these, you know?  He's just talking to the Jim Brewer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm just talking to the camera.  Yeah, and this lady, she works at the toy store.  This one creeped me out.  I'm like, Brewer's twisted.  Wow.  I don't know, just because of the character development in these things.  Okay. 
[02:52:00]  The music's already a little dark.  Yeah, yeah, that...  It's got a little psychotic thing to it.  Yes.  How do I know your videos better than you?  Because I just tape them, and then I'm done.  And I'm just...  And I'm assuming the editor would do well.  Some brewers walking through the store.  And this is an actual toy store in town.  That's what I mean.  They said they got tons of business from this.  Oh, really? 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  She's like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Mr. Brewer.  Do you know that guy?  Because he comes in here, like, all the time.  And I keep asking for his name.  He never says anything.  He just comes in here, and he just stares at the toys.  I love the pink hair thing.  I can't help you, sir.  And he's been looking at me.  Isn't that kind of rude?  And I say, you know, welcome to Toys with Love.  I'm here to help you.  He just goes in.  I said, well, we have all different specials. 
[02:53:00]  We have Play Mobile.  We have brand new teddy bears.  I said, can you speak different languages?  Because I can speak Dutch.  I can speak German.  It's the most popular one.  It's almost up to 4,000 views.  Wow.  Yeah.  It's not even 4,000 views.  That's dumb.  It's not even 4,000 views.  I mean, I'm saying that's the popular one.  Yeah.  Hope, so you're on to something.  I'm on to something.  People like that one.  They like the creepy dark hair feel.  That is really creepy, man.  You wear a pink sweater and a pink hair.  Yeah.  Would you know that's me?  Yeah.  I would know. 
[02:53:30]  I'm looking at me and I'm like.  You're doing a really.  If I didn't know what I know.  The fucked up thing is.  I'm doing like a 19.  You're doing the characters that are like, I've seen every one of these people.  That's why I like this.  I know every one of these fucking people.  Everyone can relate to these characters.  You're not pulling some person out of your ass that like, no, I knew this person.  No, we all know these people.  Now you're going to be hopped up.  I'm going to do more in the summer.  I'm going to do a couple in the summer.  Fucking funny, man.  I'm going to do summertime cats.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm going to do them for a goof.  For a goof.  For a goof.  Come on.  It's a goof. 
[02:54:00]  A jerk off.  It's a goof.  What's wrong with you?  I'm over here now.  I'm over here now.  Nice.  I'm over here.  And I could speak French because I started taking all different languages since I was  a little baby.  Just because of that.  I said, well, if you need any help, that's why I'm here.  Do it with a laugh.  I'm here for you.  Okay?  And then he just walked away.  It's very strange.  I don't know who he is.  Maybe there's something wrong with him.  Maybe there's something wrong with him. 
[02:54:30]  The faces are great, man.  You've got to see these people.  Don't say nothing.  But I know that my boyfriend delivers the newspaper every day and I got him a brand new  present.  He's got a lot of Christmas this year.  I got him a Slim Jim lightsaber.  If you save up 456 wrappers from Slim Jim, I saw it online, which I did.  I went to every county and I saved all the Slim Jim wrappers.  And I had to dig some of them out of garbage, but it was still worth it because now they sent  me a seven foot one lightsaber. 
[02:55:00]  I couldn't even pick it up.  I couldn't even pick it up.  He's going to be so excited.  He's going to need two people to fight him.  Anyway, don't tell him because I'm really excited.  And he's just a green guy trying to talk something into him.  He's really weird.  Okay, I'm going to take care of him.  Wow.  And then Bror walks out of the store.  I'm going to have to, you know, when I was filming these too, there was one place where  my dad, I told the kid to put it on there, where I was playing a joke and my 
[02:55:30]  dad, and he was in my minivan.  And while he was sitting out there, I'm able to open the side doors.  And I said, like, listen, don't touch any buttons.  Just sit here.  We're going to go in the candles.  Yeah, sit right here, right here.  So, of course, we have a microphone in the car.  And now we're in the store and each door is open and he's looking around.  And then I set off the panic. 
[02:56:00]  So when I come back, I'm like, Dad, what are you doing?  He's like, I didn't touch a car.  It's not me.  I said, well, you're obviously touching something.  Ah, I said, move your elbow.  Move your elbows on the thing.  And then we did this for like 10 minutes.  We were howling watching this.  That's the video I want to get up there.  I don't see it on there, but I'll make sure that gets up there.  Well, thanks for the plug, man.  You're mad with these things.  No, they're great.  I loved doing them.  It's fucking great.  It was more like a Facebook thing, you know. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  That's the lady jogging around the neighborhood with the big boobies that he plays.  Top right.  Yeah.  Every character is drastically different.  No, we don't have to play anymore.  Yeah.  They're worth checking out on your own, though, man.  Yeah.  Thanks, man.  They really are.  Well, the chick.  Oh, wow.  That guy's got a lot of views, too, at a day seven, dude.  I don't know why.  Which is day seven, dude?  Some of them have way more views than other ones.  Maybe.  Like the day five ones.  Whatever.  It's all good.  Nah, there should be way more views.  It doesn't matter, Sean. 
[02:57:00]  Exactly.  It doesn't matter who's on there or what's going on.  In fact, it's been in all different characters.  It doesn't matter.  I can't understand what you're saying, Ozzy.  It doesn't matter, Sean.  We were going on a toilet.  I tell him he's sick and we're not going to be going on a toilet.  There goes $50 million to watch in the toilet.  How is the family?  How are the daughters? 
[02:57:30]  Everyone's good?  Yeah, they're good.  Well, you got a boy.  You're safe.  I can't imagine having a daughter.  Nah, a 12-year-old, they want a phone.  I won't give a phone yet.  Yeah?  And my kid's like, the only 12-year-old without a phone.  And you'd think I'm barbaric.  Yeah.  And other parents are like, why don't you give your kid a phone?  Like, because you don't need one.  Well, what if they're at practice and they get off early?  Well, then the coach calls me, stupid.  Right, just like how it was when we were growing up.  Right.  What if there's an emergency? 
[02:58:00]  Is there a new epidemic where a kid starts going into a seizure and they're on the floor  and everyone's going, oh, I wish she had a phone and we'd be able to help her?  What are you talking about if there's an emergency?  What about when they're at the bus stop?  When they're at the bus stop with 40 other kids?  Like, what are you talking about?  Are you retarded?  And then they went, well, my kids started slashing themselves and they're watching pornography.  I don't know what's going on.  I do.  You gave them a phone, stupid. 
[02:58:30]  They're not calling anyone.  They're texting and they're going on the Internet.  There's little cutters out there?  Oh, it's bad.  Oh, Christ.  Dude, it's weird and creepy.  You go, wait, what's going on?  When do they start getting phones?  What's the age?  Some dummies give them their phone at 8, 9, 10.  Yeah, true.  And then they wonder, like, hey, I'll give you a good one.  You know what's good is when other families look at you and they're like, you guys. 
[02:59:00]  I would never do that.  And I would never do that.  And, you know, the minute I give them a phone, and this one kid's like 12, half the 12-year-olds  in my town are dating.  They're 12.  They're 12.  Like real dating?  Yes.  Not that fake dating we had?  No.  This is...  Where you said you were going with someone and you barely looked at them at school and  then maybe you talked to them on the phone for five minutes and you were dating.  This is real shit.  This is to the point where they're like, have your mother drop you off at the movie theater. 
[02:59:30]  Shenanigans.  And then we'll walk around the building and then come back here when the movie's over.  I timed it.  It's an hour 37 minutes and I'll meet you.  And it's, you know, how'd that happen?  I don't know, because they were texting, dummy.  Yeah, I don't get it.  I don't get it.  It is just like private communication.  My kid's like Rapunzel.  We gave my daughter a...  How old are your kids now?  12, 9, 7. 
[03:00:00]  12, 9, 7.  Wow.  The oldest one, we gave her a...  What's the reading thing on a computer?  Kindle or something?  Kindle.  Thank you.  As she's opening the Kindle, she thought it was a phone.  And this is how kids are so into phone.  She started hyperventilating.  She went, oh my God!  Oh my God!  She started shaking hysterically.  Oh, no.  And I went, babe, babe, it's not a phone.  So stop shaking.  And she went, oh, oh, it's a Kindle. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, it's a Kindle.  He really got that nuts because she thought it was a phone?  She was losing her mind.  She lost her mind.  I'm not even exaggerating.  She lost her mind.  She thought it was a phone.  These kids are nuts.  These kids have...  I called my other friend.  He goes, yeah, my wife gave our 10-year-old daughter an iPad.  iPad.  Oh, and an iPad?  As in an $800 iPad?  Yeah.  Dude, you got to control your house. 
[03:01:00]  You got to control your house.  That's a little much.  My kid's almost two.  He's taking over the iPad.  He's got his own iPad.  He knows his way around his iPad.  I'm sure he does.  He does.  I'm sure.  He presses that button like chimpanzees.  They know what's going on.  He's an app-ing fool, man.  He knows how to turn the fucking thing on, slide it over, and then finds his apps.  And he finds his apps.  It's creepy.  What does he get on?  What does Henry get on there?  Watch Henry.  Watch him.  Watch him turn the computer on.  This kid's a genius over here. 
[03:01:30]  One's called Fish School.  I love that one.  I called him Henry.  What did I call him Henry for?  I meant Hudson.  I thought Henry Hudson.  Henry Hudson.  There's like nursery rhyme apps where they do things as the song's playing.  And he plays them?  There's a spider and there's things you can do while the spider's-  On the screen?  Do you have to do that too easy?  Up the water spout?  Yeah, but then you touch the spider and now it goes up the spout.  He touches it again.  It goes back down.  And then you touch the clouds and the clouds blow.  Really?  All sorts of weird shit.  Virtual acid trip.  Wow. 
[03:02:00]  Cool.  And he knows how to fucking find his own shit on the iPad.  It's crazy.  It is pretty.  It's so weird.  It's intense.  Well, you know.  We just had a different thing.  We'd have that little cone thing where you put the donuts on.  And your mom would be like, oh my God, he did it in order.  He's brilliant.  He's two years old.  He knows to put the blue and the orange and the red and the green.  I'm not that parent.  I just assume every kid that's almost two. 
[03:02:30]  How old is he?  He's going to be a-  He'll be two in May.  So he's 20 months.  He's going to be a starfighter.  He's going to be like a Star Wars kid when he's six.  Nah, I assume all 20-month-olds are doing the exact same thing.  And there's no difference.  It's like TV, too.  They know.  They know.  It's just like food.  They're not dumb.  They just can't communicate yet.  I know.  He's got his programs.  And he'll tell me which one he wants by shaking his head, yes or no.  My brother turned me on.  They're like little cavemen, yeah.  My brother's- 
[03:03:00]  My brother Quinn is the greatest human being.  He gets upset.  My brother Quinn rules because he turned me on a little bear.  What?  He goes little bear.  What's a little bear?  It's like fucking being a drug addict.  What's little bear?  Has he tried little bear yet?  What's little bear?  You've got to get a hit of little bear.  Little bear, man.  I don't know what little bear is.  You don't know what little bear is?  No, it's little bear.  How old are your kids?  Those are seven.  You've got to understand, too. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, that thing?  Little bear is the most boring fucking kid show ever, but for some reason, the little  kids love it.  It looks terrible.  And it's so mellow that it puts them to sleep.  It's gentle.  It's horrible.  I don't get it.  Like, I get the Yo Gabba Gabba.  Gabba Gabba.  They go nuts.  I get it.  But I get it.  Nuts.  You go nuts for that?  I get Blue's Clues.  He's a Blue's Clues kid.  That's our Beatles, Yo Gabba Gabba.  That's their Beatles.  Yes, it is.  Fucking Barney, though.  I know we've done the Barney bits over the years.  Barney's done.  Yeah, Barney is old school. 
[03:04:00]  He's done.  He likes Barney, and Barney is a fucking creep.  No, he's not.  He's a pedophile.  No, he's not.  Dude.  He teaches him manners.  I love you.  It's creepy.  Barney is fucking creepy.  He's good.  I liked Barney.  My kids would say, thank you, and please, and clean up.  Why is this adult allowed to just hang out with the kids like he's doing?  He's in an outfit.  He's a dinosaur.  He's a dinosaur.  No, he's a pedophile.  No.  With his own crib, where the kids are just dropped off every day.  That was the good one.  I didn't.  We're not used to tell it to be.  You missed tell it to be. 
[03:04:30]  And we all have to be very, very quiet.  Come on.  Spring logic.  I can be very, very quiet.  This is for the parents.  This is for the parents to keep the kids quiet, but he loves it.  And it shows him out.  Why do we have to be very, very quiet?  Because mommy and daddy need some fucking sleep.  What do you think?  That's why they put this shit on.  That's very nice of you. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, it's whatever.  It's really just chill, though.  This is no fucking Roadrunner.  And he's obsessed with that much.  My kid's obsessed with Toy Story.  Uh-oh.  Toy Story.  Toy Story.  Oh, that's a good one.  Pixar, yeah.  That's a good one.  He loves.  Shit.  Fucking loves Buzz Lightyear.  That's a good one.  That's class act stuff right there.  Creepy how much he loves.  Nemo is heavy.  Not Nemo yet.  Toy Story is heavy.  What did you just say?  Uh, Roadrunner.  Oh, my.  Wonder Brothers. 
[03:05:30]  Just yesterday on Cartoon Network, my seven-year-old discovered the Roadrunner.  Oh, man.  And she's like, Dad, watch the coyote.  Constantly tries to catch the bird.  You know, she's explaining to you what this fucking weird Roadrunner coyote thing is all  about.  It's only been on TV for 50 years, probably.  Yeah.  And I actually started watching, because they also had, so now I'm sitting down, and then  they start Foghorn Leg. 
[03:06:00]  Oh, Foghorn Leg.  I forgot how funny that was.  Hey, boy.  I keep throwing them.  You keep missing them, boy.  Boy's about as sharp as a sack of wetting mice.  And there's a scene where he goes to the doghouse, and he goes in, he grabs the dog's ass, and  he pulls up, and he's got a big badge.  Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.  Because he's on a tight leash.  Yeah, he's on a tight leash.  And he just runs right past where the dog is.  Yeah, shut up, boy.  Boy.  Boy.  Now if it's a chicken hawk you want there, son. 
[03:06:30]  I like when the kid with the glasses, and he's all geeky and nerdy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Foghorn Leg goes, and I think this is the only way they could kind of get, make a  gay joke.  Because it was like Foghorn would look at the kid and go, nice boy, but something kind  of eeeh about him.  Something kind of eeeh about him.  I was like, wow, they really fucking get around this kid.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what they meant.  What's the matter, kid? 
[03:07:00]  You don't play baseball?  You don't like that ball playing, do you, son?  Boy.  What kind of pants you're wearing now, son?  And the assholes changed the voice of Foghorn Leghorn for what?  That commercial.  They get older.  No, they came up with a new guy.  Well, that's Mel Blanc is dead.  No, I know, but you could certainly find someone that is closer to the original.  Maybe, yeah.  You got lazy finding the new Foghorn Leghorn.  Mel Blanc was so good with this.  Hey, boy.  Hey, boy.  I say, I say, I say. 
[03:07:30]  South of the Winnie is the place for me.  They would sing in these things.  Yeah.  I feel a sassafras tea.  Oh, doodate.  He's going south.  Uh-oh.  I say Magnolias.  Mm-mm.  I must be south of the good old Macy Dixie line.  Macy Dixie line.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just jumping out.  Jumping out with an umbrella.  He's really taught kids some fun things.  Ah, mint julep. 
[03:08:00]  I say, I say, I'm getting in trouble with the Negroes.  Pappy.  Huh?  I'm hungry.  Well, I'm not a can of black-eyed peas, Elvis.  Oh, Pappy.  We's chicken hogs.  Why can't we have chicken?  Because there just ain't no chickens around here.  Oh, that's why.  This is so racist.  There ain't no chickens around here.  There ain't no chickens so bad, I declare I can almost smell one. 
[03:08:30]  Now you know what they're referring to when they say chicken.  Exactly.  Oh, they're spine foggy.  I love when they do that.  They take his feathers off and make him look like he's a cooked chicken.  That's what I'm going to do.  Chicken.  They love chicken.  Oh, boy.  Elvis, drop that leg.  Your nose always gets to drum a steak. 
[03:09:00]  Now go start the fire, and I'll get the critter ready for the oven.  Oh, shit, he's ripping his feathers out.  I'm getting y'all ready for dinner.  If you don't mind, sir, I can dress myself for dinner.  Oven's all ready, Pappy.  I keep my feathers numbered for just such an emergency.  That's what he said yesterday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just such an emergency.  Just such an emergency.  He's got an axe. 
[03:09:30]  He's going to cut his head off.  For dinner?  Well, now, that's mighty neighborly of you.  What's on the menu?  Roast chicken?  Namely?  Yo!  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm a rooster, not a roaster.  You just have to find yourself another chicken.  Goodbye, now.  I'm going to sweep it.  There's a little sound about it.  Go get the squirting.  He's running away.  Ah, he keeps going.  That's fucking great shit, though. 
[03:10:00]  These old Warner Brothers cartoons were just fucking...  He's chasing him with an axe.  I love the...  Got a gun.  Yeah.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  I like that.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  Yeah.  Ooh, you varmint!  Now I've got to go back to the ship and get another match.  Ooh!  Eh!  Sorry.  You long-eared galoop. 
[03:10:30]  You long-eared varmint!  You fin-flappin' flounder!  You crazy balooka!  Hammer-headed halibut!  And the shark kept biting his foot.  Those were the days.  Darn-e-mite!  Ooh!  What are you trying to do, rabbit?  Stuck season!  Stuck season!  I'm heading to Chattanoogie!  Hey, rabbit! 
[03:11:00]  Come to the radio station with me.  I'm going to bring you there.  It's going to be a...  You're not taking no thousand dollars from me!  Oh, boy.  Eh!  Let's take a walk.  Oh, brother.  There goes me bread and butter.  Eh!  Ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge.  This is what I've got to turn my son on to.  Yeah, these things...  Fuck that little bearable.  The animation was good.  Like, now it's so done with computers that it takes away the actual art of the animation. 
[03:11:30]  You think?  Yeah  This shit was great  The anime  What did I just watch this weekend  And I couldn't believe  I watched it from the beginning  And I was fascinated  And I couldn't walk away  It was like Rapunzel  The new Rapunzel  Oh yeah  And the animation  The people looked real  But the story  I'm literally like this  Like what  Is this  Am I watching Rapunzel  It is fucking amazing  I'm watching Rapunzel  And I couldn't walk away from it  Yeah  Oh brother  That's where I'm at 
[03:12:00]  Dad's down there  Blowing out a port of a missile  And I'm watching Rapunzel upstairs  Your life is going great  Life's going zero-ville  And your kid still doesn't have the phone  No phone  You're gonna have to give in though  I think the parents end up  Giving in to peer pressure eventually  Maybe when she's 14  Maybe  Oh fuck  She's gonna kill you by that point  She'll need it  She'll need it for her  I wanna know why you need it  Three daughters huh  I keep asking  Why do you need it  Damn  Three fucking daughters  Oh my god

[03:13:00]  Well that's what we're doing  What are the kids doing  Right  That is true  So like what are you doing  You're not even  You're not even  Calling anyone  You just stand there  Texting and watching videos  Well no one uses their phones  To call people anymore  Brewer  I get so pissed when people call me  I hate when my phone rings  The phone starts vibrating  I fucking hate it  Vibrates once  You think it's a text or something  Right  And it vibrates again  And you're like  I actually go  You gotta be shitting me  Yeah who's going  And I pick the phone up  And then whatever name comes up  I just go 
[03:13:30]  Fucking  And then whatever name  Yeah  I always know it's either  A dummy or an old person  True  That was really funny  But that's it  Everyone else  There's no one calls now  You tell  There's no reason to call  There's no time for conversations  Voicemails  I'm like what  What are they leaving  A voicemail  Give me a call  Call  Text me  Right  Text me  You got my attention  Yeah  Whatever you want to say  Text me  I'll text you back  As soon as that phone buzzes  You got me  So fucking text me what you need

[03:14:30]  There's a written record  Of what was fucking  What has to be done  Right  And if I'm like  Oh fuck yeah  I have to do something  I click  And you could read it  And go  Oh that's what's going on Friday  Or something  The phone call though  It's like  Oh what happened  Oh I fucking forgot  Because you fucking called me  Right  You know on my phone  You can't leave a voicemail  Oh that's good  That's smart  It was at first  So I didn't have to deal  With my mom's crazy voicemails  But now I'm thinking  Thank you  You said smart  There's no reason  To have voicemail anymore  No reason to voicemail  You see missed call 
[03:15:00]  Next  I see missed calls  So I know you called  I'll write back  I'll text you back  What's up  Yeah  And then we're done  Even business now  I don't think you need a voicemail  I've come to a point in my life  Where business  Everyone around me  That's business related  I don't even get into  Let's say we sit there  We're meeting with all my business partners  In the county  Whatever  I'll go  How's the kids  Great  So where are we at  Let's all get to it  Enough of the small talk  At the end of the day  You might come to a funeral  Right

Huh?  Did you go this weekend?  Yeah we went to Brigada  Oh yeah  It's a good time  How is Stanhope?  Stanhope is so fucking funny  And sick  He's twisted  He's well read  You don't know  He's well read  You don't know where he's going  That's what it was about him  Fucking  He's telling these stories

[03:29:30]  And now  The Opie and Anthony show  Continues  This is  After ONA Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Yes sir  Anthony's already moving up  These shorty awards  It's so funny  That  Like Ant  We're all  Digressing  Like it was supposed to be  You'd start making 
[03:30:00]  Dumb YouTube videos  On the street  Or you start podcasting  Or you start tweeting  And trying to get a shorty award  So that one day  You could get to have  Your own radio show  And now you have  Opie and Anthony  That are just sitting here  Trying to push people  To their podcasts  And their YouTube channels  Who kid  Who kid's in here  For a little bit  He's just hanging out  You know about the shorty awards  I heard about it  This is Ant's big thing now  He found out about it today  Because while the show was on 
[03:30:30]  Somebody tweeted him  And nominated him  For a shorty  And there's a shorty award  There's a  You know it's categories  Right  It's like twitter awards  And there is a radio category  Oh for real  But Opie and Anthony  Who are like the kings of radio  Neither one of them  Is chasing that radio category  They're acting as if  It doesn't exist  Opie wants people  To vote for him  For YouTube star  And Anthony wants people  To vote for him  For web show  I think Jen should be  The winner right there 
[03:31:00]  She's a vampire  You like Jen  Don't let Anthony  Hear you say that  She's like a dyke vampire  Yeah  But I mean  Because Anthony  I don't know if you know  This who kid  But he turned his entire  Basement into a studio  Yeah I saw  I watch it sometimes  They're crazy  Live from the compound  Yeah the green screen  Yeah and he turns it  Into whatever  He had a penis behind him  One time  He did  In one of the episodes  I don't know what you were watching  It's probably some of your videos  I don't know  With his green screen  Video typo  I don't know  Yeah because his goal 
[03:31:30]  Is to have  The most  Professional looking show  With the least professional content  Like he wants  To have like  A million dollar show  That is completely  Completely unprepared for  Ill-equipped to do anything  But  Technologically  Better than anyone else  Just content wise  No effort put into it  Whatsoever  But now  Instead of going after  Like you know  Radio prizes  And becoming  You know  We are the number one guys  In radio  Like it used to be  Opie and Anthony  Were starting radio wars 
[03:32:00]  With everybody  No way  Now it's  Yeah I mean  They used to start radio wars  With Howard  They started radio wars  With everybody  But now  It's  Oh we're on the radio  I forgot  That's like the side thing  Like that's whatever  Like yeah that's what I do  To pay the bills  But my real passion here  Is either  Hey I like that right there  That's hot yo  YouTube or  Or  Or the web show  Live from the compound  And yeah  Like that looks professional right  Yo he has an intervention show  Yeah he does  He does intervention shows  This is the other thing he does 
[03:32:30]  That's gangster yo  He does  That's not a real table is it  No  None of it's real  No way  It's all green screen  Get out of here  I mean there's a table there  But it doesn't look like that  There's  What  He does shows  Quote on quote  Where he just turns on  Whatever show he's watching  And then that's the show he's doing  Like if it's  Toddlers and Tierras nights  Anthony's gonna do  The Toddlers and Tierras show  If it's intervention night  Anthony's doing  The intervention show  And it's great 
[03:33:00]  And it's hilarious  And I think  Well  I don't think it's gonna win a shorty  I think it's gonna come in second place  For a shorty award  For web show  Cause right now  Zack Ryder  WWE superstar  He's on top  He's on top  He's number one  Wow  And  No homo  He's on top though  Yeah  And I don't know  And I don't know if he's gonna do better  Show who kid  Though you know  We're talking about  Anthony stuff  Opie is trying to get  YouTube star  And he  I think Opie's a little more bashful  Like  Anthony  Is totally  He doesn't give a shit  He doesn't mind  Plugging his shit  All day long 
[03:33:30]  Cause he wants  That shorty award  Whereas Opie  Is a little more bashful  He's like  I don't wanna sit here  He wants to be nominated  For YouTube star  Show uh  Pull up  Opie's video  That he did yesterday  You're gonna have  Gina Carano  On your show  On Saturday  Right  Yeah  Look at  This is Opie's  YouTube video  She's hot though  Yeah I know  She was in here yesterday  I saw her walk by  I was like  Yo can you  Give me a boner Saturday  She was like  Oh I'll definitely  Give you a boner  I don't think  That exchange  Ever took place  She kicked me  In my chest though  Yeah exactly  She would destroy you 
[03:34:00]  Um  Look at this video  Yeah I like that  Oh my god  That's Jim  She got uh  What's that  You got something else  On Paul  She got Jim  Is that Jim Norton  In the sleep hole  Yeah  Is that a real good  Yo yeah  Ant's a big gun guy  Ant would get along  Well in hip hop  Except he doesn't  Like black people  Other than that  Other than the whole  You know  Racism angle  They gotta act white  Exactly  He doesn't realize yet  Yep  Um 
[03:34:30]  Look at  Look at this  This is why  Opie wants to be  A YouTube star  Cause he has  Pretty much  The number one  YouTube channel  There is  Hold on  Okay  What are you  What is wrong  With this guy  Look at uh  Yes we are  Oh  Yeah Jim Norton  In a sleeper hold  Right there  One more  Is that phlegm  Gina Carano  Putting Jim Norton  In a choke hold  Yesterday  Yeah it really was  Is that phlegm though  Is that  It's phlegm  When I tap  Stop though  Cause I'm gonna  Tap very quickly 
[03:35:00]  Okay  We can try it  Phlegm  She got the phlegm  Are you gonna  Let Gina Carano  Do any moves  To you  I'm gonna  Have her  Just kick me  In my nuts  Is that  Something that  Would get you  Off a little bit  Cause I get  Boners when you  You don't get  Boners when girls  Kick you in your nuts  No  Why would I get  Boners when girls  Kick me in my nuts  I'm black  I have a big cock  So when they  Kick me in my nuts  It just pops up  Is that  It seems like  It would hurt  It sounds very  Logical  Very strange  No really 
[03:35:30]  Although we had  An intern  Who used to do  All kinds of  Crazy shit  Whose name  Was Pat Duffy  Yeah  And we once  Had a fan  Who he was  Attracted to  At the time  Come in  And she just  Kicked him in the  Nuts like  Four or five  Times in a row  No I can't  I can't  You're fucking  Around  You can't  Actually  No she just  Kept kicking him  In the nuts  And he'd fall  Over and he'd  Scream and then  He'd stand up  And say okay  One more time  It was the  Weirdest thing  E-Rock  You ever 
[03:36:00]  You ever  Get kicked  In the nuts  To kind of  Get off  To get off  No  You can't  See that  As being nice  Like who  Could watch  Gina Carano  You understand  If Gina Carano  Kicked you in your  Nuts  Like they'd be  Flattened  I told her  To hold both  My arms  And give me  The biggest  Kick ever  I forgot  What is that  What is that  Move called  Where they hold  Both your arms  In the knee  I don't know  What any of  These moves  You're talking  About are called  But she's a  Kickboxer  You want a  Kickboxer to  Come and kick  You in your  Nuts  I want to  Kick her in her  Nuts right  After 2  She got a lot

[03:40:30]  Serious right there  You've never seen  A Barrett 50 Cal  On somebody's  Kitchen table  I've seen 50  Shoot some rappers  And stuff  But I never  Saw nothing like that  I gotta talk to you  Man Anthony  And have you ever  Fired a Desert Eagle  Uh no  I fired a 2-2  One time  At my mother  You shot  You fired  No I  I just gave her  Some warning shots  Right  It wasn't loaded  Nah  It was loaded  It was  Okay  You just  You just fired away  I gotta kill my mom's  Now come on  That's what I'm scared  That's crazy  Scared a bitch  I was once 
[03:41:00]  Oh my god  Who kid  I gotta tell you  I mean I told this story  On the air  I was living in an apartment  With my fiance  A couple years ago  And we had  Our landlord was a psychopath  And he ended up inviting us  To his house  And the whole thing  Went horrible  Like it was just  It was out of  A scary movie  Like to the point  Where we found an apartment  The next day  After we went to this guy's house  We said we can't be here anymore  Because this is the type of landlord  Who you wake up  Because you hear a noise  In the middle of the night 
[03:41:30]  And he's just standing  At the foot of your bed  Like it's not a good scene  So we went over to his house  We thought he was gonna like  Invite us over for business reasons  Maybe try to get us to buy the apartment  It was just a social visit  No way  It was bad  But he had  A gun collection  Just put up on the wall  It wasn't locked up anywhere  It was just on hooks  On the wall  What?  And he had two dozen guns  All over the wall  And I was like  What the fuck?  And so we went down  To the kitchen  And in the kitchen  He had a mace gun 
[03:42:00]  Like  It was a gun  Like a revolver  No way  A plastic gun  And it sprays mace  Yeah but you put a can of mace in it  And it sprays that  And we're just sitting there  Like let's ignore it  Is that like  Is that a racist  I don't know  A racist gun or something  I don't know  They use that against black people  I think  But Jess and me  We're going  Let's just ignore it  Let's just pretend  We don't even see it  Yeah that's it  Get the fuck out of here  That's real  Let's pretend not to see it  Yeah pepper spray gum  And he goes  In the middle of the conversation  He goes  You know  I bet you guys are wondering 
[03:42:30]  Why I have this on the table  If I have all those guns upstairs  And we go  Okay we were not  We were not wondering  Anything of that nature  We weren't even noticing it  And he goes like this  With a straight expression  Who kid  He goes  Well you see  It's because  If there were ever  An intruder in the home  Yeah  And I fired a gun at him  Then what would happen  If the bullet went through my wall  And into the wall  Of my neighbor's house  No  I'd be looking at a lawsuit  So this is in case of an intruder  I go 
[03:43:00]  I don't know what the fuck  Is going on here anymore  But we have to leave  You want  You want a pepper spray gun  It looks kind of effective  Do you think that'll really work though  I don't know  I don't know if you need  I want to shoot a cop with that  You want to try  That's your words  That's not  I wouldn't recommend it  I don't think you should  I know a lot of cops  Let's leave the NYPD out of it  Maybe a trooper  Maybe like a state trooper  Oh shit  What's that  The new Maxim cover  Oh my god  With Katrina Bowden  She's coming on my show  This weekend too  Oh my  You have everyone on your show

[03:44:30]  I got  For real  From people saying  Dude  Do not let Who kid  Fuck Vaughn  I don't like this  I don't like where it's going  I didn't like that he was  You know I FedExed her some sperm  You didn't not FedEx anyone  You know the new FedEx  They could hold a sperm  Like it's still alive  The new FedEx  It has to be expressed though  It gotta be like one day delivery  Of course you can't go cheap  But everybody was made to feel  Very uncomfortable  With you flirting with her  The whole time  She liked it though  She tasted salty  I don't know anything about that  I was trying to get 
[03:45:00]  Troy Kwan in here  You know Troy  I know what you're saying  But I don't agree with it  Do you know Troy Kwan  The man with the flames  Coming out of his shirt  Yeah yeah yeah  Wow this guy is fire yo  This is an up and coming DJ  Oh for real  Okay  DJ Troy Kwan  Who kid  Who kid is like  The man  When it comes to DJ  Now  Who kid you're trying to make  A name for yourself  You know  In the clubs and everything  Who kid made a name for himself  Stealing tapes out of  Out of record studios  Robbing people  So it's a different text 
[03:45:30]  Jay Z and all these guys  But what kind of advice  Do you have for somebody  Who's coming up now  Like Troy Kwan  You need to rob like David Guetta  If you ever meet Deadmau5  Just steal his freaking  Steal his shit  Pull out a gun  Get his hard drive  And run  Do you feel like  You have integrity as a DJ  You gotta be gangster  You ready for this man  Like who kid has no integrity  As a DJ  Yeah  Like he's just like  Oh that's some hot shit  Let me steal it  When he's not looking  And then I'll play it  Yeah I mean  That's not what everybody does  Just steal other people's shit  But don't  Do you feel like 
[03:46:00]  I'm putting out a product  I'm really gonna build something  Hell no  And who kid's like  Fuck that  Nah man  Get that pepper spray gun  We were talking about earlier  You see Deadmau5  You put it to his face  Just steal his gang color shit  Give me your shit  Take his god damn  Come on  If you ever see Pauly D  You rob him like immediately  Is it true  I heard people saying  What  50 Cent fired you for Pauly D  Yeah I'm so happy yo  You're happy about that  What  That is gangster yo  Why are you happy about that  I got replaced by Pauly D  You were 50 Cent's DJ  For the longest  Yeah  And then Pauly D 
[03:46:30]  Came on to G-Unit Records  I thought it was  It's like God  Coming inside me  As an emanating aura of love  God's a man right  Yeah  It's okay now  It's fine  It doesn't matter  I thought that was a goof  By the way  When I first heard that  There's no way that  Pauly D  From the Jersey Shore  I don't take him seriously  Whatsoever  As a DJ  No  Or as anything  No  The thing is  He is  Signed to G-Note  So he's doing like  House and technical albums 
[03:47:00]  Which G-Note  He's not 50 Cent's DJ  It's a house and  Open format label  So basically what he's doing  Is he's probably paying  Somebody else to come up with songs  Then he's putting his name on it  You think that's what Pauly's doing  I can't really see him  I don't know why  Maybe I'm wrong  I just can't see him actually  You never met him before  He's been on the show  Yeah he's a nice guy  Yeah he's a nice guy  He was always like  Well yeah what people  Don't understand about me  Is I was taking this shit  Seriously before the Jersey Shore  But it's like  But then how come  Nobody knew of you  Until the Jersey Shore  He'd be getting mad bitches  Yeah that's  Bitches  And that's the key Troy 
[03:47:30]  At the end of the day  That's all that really matters  He's the same bitch  Because that's what  Yeah a little bit  Did you model yourself  After Pauly D  A little bit  A little bit  I admire what he's done  And he's tatted up  Like Troy Pauly D  Yeah  But you know  Pauly D will never give me  The secrets of ointment  That he uses in his hair  Maybe you can  Because y'all got the same flow  Is it jizz  Wow  Get some of that  I don't know about that  Roll into FedEx some to you  I'm selling some  I don't know  I don't know what he uses  I just don't wash my hair  That's it  Yeah  And it just stays in position  Yeah  You don't use no black cream  Or nothing like that 
[03:48:00]  No I used to use  Royal Crown  It just gets too  Too oily  Too greasy  Wow  You ever think of slicking your hair back  Like old school  I think I'm getting there  I would  I'm gonna switch it up for 2012  You should  Yeah  2012's a new year  Do you  Take a certain amount of integrity  In your work  When you're DJing  Well of course  Yeah  Cause who kid does not  Well I mean  I think we come from different worlds  You know what I mean  He does his thing  I do mine  Who kid's all about the money right now  He's just like  Look  I'm trying to get famous  I'm trying to get some money  Cause I'm gonna die one day 
[03:48:30]  So you know  This is what I do  If Bruce Willis is in the party  I make sure he comes in the booth  And bring some white bitches  Or some black bitches in there  Either way  We die hard in the booth  Yeah  Go crazy  Give him the plump fist  And then  Now you got promo  Then Us Weekly  For some reason is in there  Right  You're not really paying attention  You'll play whatever  Who gives a shit  As long as Bruce Willis  Is in the booth  I gotta take my shirt off  And just act like  We're dying hard  You know  I'm not partying with Bruce Willis  Yeah  Yeah  But I think the time will come  Was there a time  Who kid  Where you were more like 
[03:49:00]  I gotta make sure  This sounds good  I gotta make sure  Or were you always just like  Fuck that  I became  You know  I DJed for  This guy named  I forgot who I DJed for first  The guy that did that song  Backed that ass up  Oh Juvenile  Juvenile  He had that white girl song  He had that big white girl song  Back that ass up  Back in the days  When white girls had no ass  Right  But the shit that's crazy  Is I DJed for him  But he  Those replay machines  Is what I DJed with  See that right there  That was it  No nothing  No turntables  Two replays  Just hitting buttons  That's what I did 
[03:49:30]  A 50 Cent concert  That's it  You just had a song on a button  And you just hit the button  And play  That's it  Like I even had a cut on a button  Like  Chirret  Chirret  You wouldn't mix it all?  You had the sound  I had the cut sound  Yeah  At 50  He was like  Yo who kid  Cut that shit my nigga  I'd be like  Chirret  Chirret  Did you even have turntables  In front of you?  Hell no  Because  You can't have gunshots  Going off  That is so funny to me  Right  So it was like  I went and got the movie  Heat  With Robert De Niro 
[03:50:00]  I just stole all the gunshots  From there  So when they just go off  In a fucking concert  People would be  Literally  Would be running  Yeah  Because it sounds so real  So all these DJs  Are like trying to perfect  Their art  Of like mixing  And on the turntables  And even digitally  And doing  And you can just like  Air rap  With a button  This is not Kanye West  With fucking  Some scratching  Asian guy in the back  This is 50 cent  With a gun  In front of fucking  10,000  20,000 people  So I have to like  Really make it  Like seriously gangster  So you're not  Mr. Like  Lock yourself in a basement

[03:51:00]  That he's just doing  The little buttons  Like Who Kid's like  No man  I'll push some buttons  And I'll try to get  Some celebrities up  In the booth  And that's it  You ever saw  Like the David Guetta video  Where it's like  He's DJing  And then the shit skips  No I didn't see that  Sometimes you know  DJs get lazy  And then they just  Want to just  He'll just pump this  But it'll just be like  A long hour set  On a hard drive  But  Right  But like  David Guetta  It's already too late  He's famous  Who gives a fuck  You've never had  The experience  Of worrying  Uh oh  What if somebody  Knocks into the turntable  Never  Because it's a hard drive  But I do DJ now

[03:52:00]  For the performance  Trying to have a good performance  But you know  I like rocking a party  That's sort of  You know  And if you're not performing  People are just looking at you  Like this is bullshit  You know  Yeah  But top it off  All you gotta do  Is be a really good DJ  Cause obviously  I get booked  All year round  I got almost like  A hundred shows a year  So obviously  I'm somewhat good  But  Yeah of course  Celebrity  Just get your name out there  Some people don't even know  What I look like  But they know who  Who kid is  Right  Or the who kid  You gotta get a scream  Like how would you scream  Your name  How would I scream it  Yeah  I don't know 
[03:52:30]  I have to think about that  Do you have soundbites  That are yours  Like who kid has  Like a set of soundbites  Like he has the Tarzan guy  And he has the kids going  Yay  Like you gotta have like  A little bit  I mean yeah  I'm starting to incorporate  More stuff  I'm starting to figure out  My live show a little more  As opposed to just  Straight rocking a party  When I'm driving around  Like Jess doesn't understand  My fiance  And when I'm driving around  With her listening to your show  On Shade 45  She's like  Why the fuck does he keep  Playing those sounds  During the songs  I'm just trying to listen  To the songs  And I keep hearing  Kids screaming 
[03:53:00]  And Tarzan going  And monkeys  You see  It's just a signature thing  Like if I have a thing  Called a splash tour  When I tour all over the world  You know  When I play house music  There's a splash sound  That comes on  But that's me just  You know  Bukkakeing all the girls  In the club  See I never understood  Is that so people  Know it's you  Is that so people  Don't steal your shit  Because your sounds  Are already in there  That's one thing too  If you get exclusive  You don't want to  Just play it out there  Unless you're going to  Physically  Or you're going to  Do it yourself  Yo what up  Yo that's my shit  Yeah  But if you got the

[03:58:00]  And then where is it going into  My ass  That's right  Then I got that  Other than  I got that  I was waiting for the subway  Then I got another text  To make sure  To tell him  That I got out of the subway  To repay again  Which is awesome  You and Tom Papa  Not on good terms  I love Tom Papa  That's the thing  But he thinks that you  Have a vendetta against him  I think so  Yeah  Because another  India  Who  Started it  From the last one  You're talking about the comedy  You're still pissed  About the comedy department  Yeah because that's 
[03:58:30]  That's where it stems from  Because he goes  The second time  I go  It hasn't been two times  I go  Oh yeah  Fucking assholes  Somebody already says  Troy that they're stealing  Your shit  And changing the title  Of their thing  To Mexicans and Mojitos  Okay  So  Fair enough  You know  People are going to  Steal your shit  That's fine  It's there for free download  You can grab it for free  That's great  Take it an hour long  Of brand new music  Check it out  But we have Ronnie B  Coming in later this week  Ron Bennington  Is going to be on the ONA show  Unless if I have to cancel

[03:59:30]  And Troy  You were not happy  Making this one  He's an idiot  Like we were back there  Yesterday with him  I had Bobo come up here  Like after the show yesterday  So you guys didn't have  To deal with him  Troy couldn't have  Had less to do with him  Like I had to sit in there  And coach Bobo  Through what we wanted him  To record  And Troy  You were like  You were somewhere else  Yeah  But you know Bobo  Have been calling Liam  Crying every day  About what 
[04:00:00]  That nobody wants him  Back on the show  He was in recording  A bit yesterday  He'll be back on  When he's back on  Leave him alone  How does he have Liam's number  I don't know  There's only so much I can take  From him  Because he's retarded  Is it?

[04:00:30]  Yeah but  ONA had this way  To be very convincing about it  But you know that he's done that  On multiple occasions  Where you've said things to him  And it doesn't register  I think Bobo might be crying  With Tom Papa  Tom Papa thinks he's banned now  Is Tom Papa going to be  On the show tomorrow?  Yeah Ronnie B's on Friday  Tom Papa's tomorrow  Who else do we have tomorrow?  Tomorrow  Jerry Springer  Hey  Vinny from the Jersey Shore  Whoa  Didn't  What's his  Not about his problem  Yeah he has a new thing  Right?  Anxiety or something?

[04:02:00]  His TV show on Netflix  We all go  What?  Then  The best part of the whole meeting  Was Roland yesterday  Then after that  What happened?  Well because  He forgot that there was a meeting  And he had ordered tacos  And he quick  Went through what he had to say  And he's like  I gotta grab my tacos  And then he never came back  To the meeting  So you left the meeting  To get your tacos  My taco guy was waiting  That's what  You saw  I clicked on it  I waited five minutes  And after that  I can't wait  My taco guy  I waited any longer  That's not right 
[04:02:30]  It's not a right thing to do  I tipped him six dollars  Because he was waiting  Downstairs for like ten minutes  That was nice of him  Roland are you caring  Less and less  Is this  Am I seeing something  That's  No it's just that  My tacos are very important  That makes me happy  In the day  Roland cares less and less  Every day about himself  As a human being  But it's because  He cares too much  About the job  Like he can't handle  The stress of this job  I mean he can  He handles it  But it's difficult  And he does a great job  With it  Not with handling the stress  He does  Well no  But he deals with a lot  Of bullshit  Yeah but he's not good 
[04:03:00]  With the stress  He's just not  And that's  That's a flaw  I have my Hagen does  I know but that's the problem  You're killing yourself  Because you can't handle  The stress  Like Paula Deen  Like Paula Deen  Roland  You should be looking  At Paula Deen  As a hero  Not as a hero  Oh  You should be on the  Anthony Bourdain  Side of this food beef  I think we should  Get Anthony Bourdain back in  Absolutely we should  He rules  But Paula Deen  Is over there  Telling you to put  Maple syrup on everything  And what happened  She's had diabetes  The whole time  Or her burger  With the donuts  Yeah exactly 
[04:03:30]  Oh do you see her  I'm trying to cobbler  And literally  With like two sticks  Of butter  And this one cobbler  It's not a healthy  Lifestyle Roland  It's delicious  You should be  You know where you should  Be getting that stress out  Gymnasium  But who  But  Hmm  Eh  Easier to eat some  Haagen-Dazs isn't it  If you all  If like  Royal Pains  They send me  The first four episodes  It's phenomenal this season  Yeah  Get some fucking ice cream  To the couch  Crank one of those out  Of the ice cream  And you're like  This is a great day
