<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a heated discussion about race and crime in America, triggered by a news story detailing the rape of a 70-year-old woman.  The hosts vehemently condemned the crime, rejecting explanations that attributed it to societal factors instead emphasizing individual responsibility.  They launched into a scathing critique of the "Unfair Campaign," mocking its simplistic portrayal of "white privilege" through videos of white college students writing "Lucky to be White" on their faces.  This segued into a lengthy segment playing and reacting to WorldStarHipHop videos depicting violence and lawlessness in predominantly Black neighborhoods, prompting further discussion about race relations, lack of positive role models, and the influence of figures like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.  They also mentioned Martin Luther King Jr., Barack Obama, and 50 Cent in the context of this discussion. The hosts even considered creating their own counter-video,  proposing self-deprecating statements written on their faces.  They then transitioned to a discussion of Louis C.K.'s appearance on a television show and incorrectly analyzed the lyrics of a Rammstein song ("Du Hast").

The show continued with a series of unrelated topics.  The hosts questioned the public's generosity towards a school bus monitor who received a large sum of donations. They then discussed a Rammstein music video described as containing pornographic content featuring transgender individuals, followed by another defense of Louis C.K.'s comedy style after his Today Show interview.  Adam Sandler's film "That's My Boy" and its box office performance were critiqued, leading to a prolonged segment devoted to harshly criticizing New York Yankees announcer John Sterling's home run calls.  This discussion included a debate about the Hall of Fame inductions of baseball players like Jamie Moyer and Derek Jeter,  sparked by a caller, Todd from Indiana, who pointed out the lack of unanimous votes for Roberto Clemente.  Throughout this segment, the hosts frequently used vulgar and offensive language.


The next portion of the show began by teasing co-host Sam about his perceived lack of internet skills.  This transitioned into mockery of a "heat wave warning guy" using played audio clips. The hosts then discussed Hurricane Debbie and the perceived overreaction to hurricane forecasts in New York City. A substantial part of the show focused on playing and reacting to Anderson Silva's expletive-laden pre-fight conference call audio regarding his fight with Chael Sonnen.  They analyzed the fight's promotion and the rivalry between the fighters, referencing a previous fight.  The segment also included discussions of Jenny McCarthy's upcoming Playboy appearance (with extensive commentary on accompanying images), a negative review of a Tyler Perry movie and its actors' appearance,  repeated playing of audio clips from the recurring character "Bobo Man,"  Christy Brinkley's acrimonious divorce involving allegations of an affair with a minor, Mike Tyson's changed persona, and an update on a car accident involving 50 Cent.  The hosts made several references to past recurring segments and characters like Steve the Whistler and Balloon Animal Guy. Profanity was heavily used throughout this segment.


The show's final portion opened with crude commentary on a woman's appearance and age, mentioning various models and celebrities.  This led to a discussion of Oprah Winfrey's interviews with the Kardashians, followed by a tangent about navigating television channels and Jimmy Norton's past decisions, including rejecting an appearance on Oprah's show. The conversation then shifted to Norton's niece's birthday party and a graphic, humorous discussion of increasingly bizarre plotlines in the television show *Little House on the Prairie*. This triggered a discussion about a *Growing Pains* actress, Julie McCullough, who is a fan of the show, and whether to contact her. The broadcast concluded with detailed, absurd planning for upcoming "pig races," including discussions of potential participants, prizes, rules, and a breast-weighing contest with increasingly ridiculous methods for measurement.  The show ended with announcements of upcoming appearances and further details about the pig races, along with some behind-the-scenes commentary.

[00:28:00]  there's an event going on tonight  stop it  where's the event  I don't know  it's called looking at affirmative action through a different lens  ooh good  and where is this event  New York hopefully  maybe we can send some people down there  an event  what is this about  please enlighten me  why don't you have an open mind  and go to the event tonight  ooh  there's truth  and get some writing on your head  you come in tomorrow  you can't get it off  tattooed  this event  there is truth  in the saying 
[00:28:30]  racial history is tomorrow's solution  this workshop examines how race was used to divide people  how and why white privilege was embedded into our culture  and why it is important to understand the history as we move forward  to work towards a more equitable society  you know what  that's nice  that in itself is not wrong  that's nice  you could get a little educated on the whole thing  what  you got some education  how is that not wrong  um  you learn  nothing wrong with learning  knowing the racial history is important 
[00:29:00]  right  whatever the issue is  knowing is important  what they're going to be preaching is revisionist crap  it may be  yeah  and we are set up  the society has been set up for white privilege  it always has been  hey how about no  the society was set up for the people that fucking came here  and built shit  and unfortunately  sorry  brought over slaves  but it was  it was  why would you build a society based on people that aren't here  why would you build  alright  the United States was built on white privilege like they say 
[00:29:30]  right  why build a society based on anything but the people that are here  it was a lot of Italians, Germans, Irish  that came over here  Spanish  fucking  English  that came over here  they were white people  alright  what about a solution though  you know  there is a solution  it's happening  it is happening  what's the solution  the solution  is what has been going on  with civil rights  assimilating to this grand society of ours  while still embracing your culture 
[00:30:00]  but not using it as separatism  and fucking  living in a civilized society  like a human being  we have  look  we have a black president  there's a black family  residing in the White House  how bad could it fucking be  stop already  but there is  50 years ago  you're right  but there is something  disturbing about  the language  you know  you're right  you set it up for yourself  but  eh  and it takes time to change  but whoever says it's not changing 
[00:30:30]  to the point we need  guilty white shitheads  writing on their face  how fucking bad they are to be white  look at how annoying this one video is  imagine it's like  you know  1965  yeah  you're a black guy  and you're seeing  these black guys on TV  these professors going  you know we just have to prove  that we're good citizens  like you would be such a panther  you would be the  you are one of those guys  you're not the quiet reserve dude  you would be one of those  one of those guys 
[00:31:00]  I don't know  yes  you love guns  you love to yell and scream  you love to drink  I love  you would do very well there  I love legal guns  yeah  I love the fact that  I have a second amendment  that I  I use  I exercise it  it's wonderful  I  stay within the boundaries  of the laws and rules  of a civilized society  that is nothing like  those motherfuckers  you do walk in that line  but I'm saying beyond that  you're that guy  like you're the guy  look at how mad you get  at this video 
[00:31:30]  if you were a black guy  in the 60s watching  in the 60s  you wouldn't be  you could look at the change  and be like  wow  you know we really have  we really are able to enjoy  the benefits of this country now  as black people  without just being persecuted  for our skin color  you are  hey black people  welcome  welcome to the United States of America  we need a lot more years to go by  congratulations  you made it  we need a lot more years to go by  because when black people go to  Thanksgiving dinner  they see the grandma 
[00:32:00]  or the grandfather  across the table  and they know  that they were hosed  well you know what  and fucking chased by German shepherds  so it might piss them off still  that should be a reminder  of the great changes  that took place then  but if I knew  if anyone in my family  was hosed  I'd still be fucking pissed  even though it didn't happen to me  so fucking 50 years from now  I think  they're gonna have  blame it on the fact that  all these projects  and people shooting each other  and killing each other  it never ends  I think more time has to go by 
[00:32:30]  so you're not reminded all the time  oh because what  black people don't have the ability  to know right from wrong  you're coddling them again  if you knew your mom was hosed  when she was growing up  wouldn't you be bothered  by that to this day  who would I blame  I don't know who you blame  who's the cop  but wouldn't you  wouldn't you be bothered inside by that  who's the cop that  that hosed them  maybe I'd be mad at him  why am I gonna be mad at this  uh fucking  this society  this fucking  nameless  it's like when management  here points upstairs  yeah it's them  well it's not  it's not 
[00:33:00]  they believe white people  hose their  hose their  well you know what  grandparents  you can't say that  well then I'm gonna fucking lump all black people together  like they say don't do  just fucking get over it already  stop it  god damn  the Jews were fucking  uh uh  fucking enslaved for  for thousands of years  and they had the whole holocaust thing  they gotta deal with  I think a lot of years have gone by though  and Patrice  making my point  he raised a good point about the Jews  it really even a great point about why  Jews moved on  and blacks haven't in a lot of ways 
[00:33:30]  and it was a brilliant point about how  Jews had a face  like Hitler  that was the guy  and then  when world war 2 is over  the whole world  kind of came to help  they got the guy  done  black people don't feel like  they got the guy  and then it just kind of ended  and then you would live  what happened to their elders  you don't think  the Jews were a bit more sympathetic  uh uh  to be sympathetic to the Jews  after world war 2  was a little easier  than to be sympathetic  when I'm looking at world star hip hop  fucking videos  it's a little hard 
[00:34:00]  to wrap my fucking mind  around being sympathetic  and wanting to help these people out  x amount of years later  but I'm saying  if you if you go  to when world war 2 ended  it just ended  and that was the end of it  and the Jews were helped  and everybody kind of knew what happened  and then you begin moving on  but that's just  they still had to fight for a homeland  at that point  yeah  they still had to unite  which they do very well  unite for a common good  and cause of their own  that's something that  I don't really see 
[00:34:30]  the black community doing  you got an asshole  how many years  have we been able to just say  ah black leaders like  ah Reverend Al  Jesse Jackson  how many fucking years  are these guys  gonna hold on to that title  as a black leader  when they stink  no one really likes them  in the black community  there's no great leadership  there's no great camaraderie  Farrakhan  everybody loves Farrakhan  black people love Farrakhan  a lot more than they love  Al Sharpton  and Jesse Jackson  Farrakhan yeah  you don't hear  he's not  white people hate him  but Farrakhan is the guy 
[00:35:00]  and I guess in the black community  who's the most respected  I don't know  he's old school too  how come you gotta go back  fucking 20, 30 fucking years  with these people  to find some kind of a  black leadership  no one really comes out  with some really new  revolutionary kind of  ideology  and solution  to the problems  that black people face  it's all the same shit  and it all boils down  to these fucking  face-writing white douchebags 
[00:35:30]  that it's white people  it's white people's problem  it's white people's fucking  we're the ones  that are reaping  what we sowed  bullshit  blow me  unbelievable  you made that website  more popular today sir  good  I want white people  to go and see that  and black people  and see how  black people are perceived  as infants  do you feel like your life  was better because you  were born white  yeah sure  I do  sure  yeah 
[00:36:00]  it's called the world  I believe  if I was born white  in fucking  I believe it was easier  growing up white  how about if I'm born white  I had my struggles  and I made the best of myself  how about I'm born white  right now in South Africa  that's not a privilege is it  you're fucking gonna be  treated like shit  it's called the world  it happens  it's all over the place  just take your surroundings  use them to  the best of your ability  live in a civilized society  mutual respect  for people that deserve respect  not just respect 
[00:36:30]  based on fucking  the skin color  I was watching this video  that's still running  these motherfuckers  are always talking about respect  I want respect  you respect me  oh really  with your gun  and making it rain  from drug money  and fucking  not even understanding  what the fuck you're saying  the fact that you don't even  want to get a job  and build yourself up  you'd rather just rob people  and deal fucking drugs  and then the police  are the assholes  for arresting you  meanwhile you're out  in the middle of the daytime  with a fucking AR-15 
[00:37:00]  what's that an AR-15  yeah  what does that tell you  about that neighborhood  like not  fuck the guys doing it  but say you're 12  in that neighborhood  yeah  that's where you grow up  where a guy can literally  walk outside with an AR-15  and fire it into the air  knowing nothing's gonna happen  knowing nothing's gonna  and it's like okay  you grow up with that  every day you gotta go to school  it's easy to sit outside that  and go  god damn it  just buckle down and study  but that's a really difficult  that makes it very hard  when you look out 
[00:37:30]  when there's a guy  firing a pistol  without any fear  right  what do you do from there  very hard to get out  of that situation  I know there's ways to do it  and I know you can do it  but it's really  it's a huge difference  from what most of us  grow up with  I uh  oh boy  well I have to say it  I was watching the Oprah  interview with 50 Cent  and he was one of these  when did you interview him?  I was on one of her fucking  I don't even know what channel  was it recently?  oh yeah  within the last few days  and you know he was one of these guys  and he made good  but then he went back to the neighborhood  and he fucking spent some money 
[00:38:00]  like more of the homies that make it  have to go back to their neighborhoods  and try to bring it up  yeah  what solution is that?  well I  you know he  there's an ideological  but I mean  you get  you know  better places  for these kids to go  and you also  a lot of these guys  you know  make it  leave these neighborhoods  and take their money  and go to a white neighborhood  and buy a nice huge fucking spread  I don't suggest they go back  and live in these neighborhoods  but they should probably  you know 
[00:38:30]  fucking invest in some of these neighborhoods  by saying there's no way out of this  that you grow up in this  I think it's tough  again  what you're saying though  is  there's an inability  to distinguish right from wrong  no  good from bad  yes  I'm not saying that  I'm hearing people say  that because it happens  it's going to be perpetuated  they  what?  they don't have the ability to think  and say  wow  this is bad  there should be other things  that I could do  where are my parents  why can't I fucking 
[00:39:00]  go to a better school  I think  I think if it's a title  I think if it's a tidal wave of bad  it makes it a lot harder  to get out of the fucking tidal wave  if it's a little  I don't know  a little rough waters  then maybe you could figure out  how to get the fuck out  so they perpetuate by having  18 kids with fucking  18 different moms  but you're asking  no fathers  and it just keeps going  you're asking an intelligent  question as an adult  you're an adult  going back  well why can't you just do that  like yeah  you're right  that's a smart question  but I don't know if it's that easy  it's not that easy  or that black and white 
[00:39:30]  10 it's not children of the court  no no no no  they're supposed to have  some kind of  adult supervision  and parenting  therein lies another  huge problem  in the community  I understand that  but I'm saying  these guys aren't 10  but when you're 10  and you walk out  every day  and you see a guy  firing a pistol  into the air  and that's the guy  who's not getting  the shit beat out of him  that's the guy  who's not getting  his money taken  that's the guy  who's got respect  in the neighborhood  it's hard not to emulate  the guy 
[00:40:00]  who's getting respect  and who's surviving  and actually making  when you have no air conditioning  and there's fucking roaches  and you see this guy  with fucking 20 grand  in his pocket  it's really hard  I'm sure in that situation  when you're 10  to not go  that's the fucking guy  I want to be  I mean  you're a smart adult  removed  it's a question  I understand exactly  what you're saying  it's not that  I don't get that  but the solution  is not  white people  writing on their faces  yeah well those dummies 
[00:40:30]  they're just dummies  the solution isn't  Reverend Al  blaming everything  on racist  Republican Tea Party  people  it's not  Jesse Jackson  blaming white people  and then turning around  saying he wants to cut  Obama's balls off  under his breath  there needs to  this needs to be addressed  what the fuck  no  this guy's got  two fucking  he's got a Mac 10  in the middle of the day time  two of them  pointing him at the fucking camera  it's high 
[00:41:00]  look at this  kids in the background  exactly  yeah what do you think  the kids are thinking  are you kidding me  you weren't influenced  by your dad growing up  Jesus Christ  but everyone's influenced  by what they see  you're influenced  by your environment  no matter what  we all were influenced  by our parents  like that's reality  like for us  we're watching it going  what the fuck is this shit  there's a 10 year old  just trying to play outside  and look at this  look at this craziness happening  look at these cars  so how does it get fixed  I don't know  I'm not saying  the answer is easy 
[00:41:30]  but it's not so simple  as just  hey  it's not as simple  as ignore this shit  and do your own thing  you're shitty  it's like  look at that car back there  somebody has to go  and get something  out of that car  that's right behind  these guys  with fucking AK-47s  that might affect you  that might affect your dad  it's like  hey where's my soda  I left it in the car  oh shit  yeah send the kid out  another fucking gun video  let's wait a couple of minutes  I'm sort of jealous  it looks like it could be fun  they do look like  having a great time 
[00:42:00]  look at this  it looks like it's fun  the guy's dancing  drinking out of a paper bag  not a worry in the world  they don't have to worry  about a 9 to 5 job  they do have to do their taxes  oh that's right  their car payments  yeah  fuck  look at this  they're having fun  let's join them  but that's it  that's as scary  from the outside to look at  yeah  imagine walking by that everyday  cause you know  just cause you're black  doesn't mean you're not  gonna get the fucking shit  kicked out of you by those guys  no it's most  that's what you would get  90% of it is black on black 
[00:42:30]  I think one of the solutions is  you're right with Reverend Allen  and the rest of them  they gotta stop with this nonsense  that they you know  spew on these TV shows  and go and you know  try to tackle  some of these harder issues  why doesn't Reverend Allen  without casting blame  on fucking white society  white people  address the fact  that black men  are having much too much sex  with a lot of women  getting them pregnant  and having kids  that don't have  any father figures  whatsoever  and it just perpetuates 
[00:43:00]  this whole thing  how come that's not addressed  and I mean  seriously addressed  they do address it a lot  all those guys do  but it's glazed over  because they'd rather put  fucking Zimmerman  on the front page  yeah  and have  Zimmerman  and discuss Zimmerman  on fucking MSNBC  than they do  the fact that  illegitimate children  running rampant  in the black community  but Sharpton's not  a quote unquote  black leader  he is  the media props him up  I don't know 
[00:43:30]  a lot of the black guys  that listen to the show  they always call him out  and say look he doesn't  speak for me  we hear that all the time  he's the guy you go to  if you've got problems  he is like a loud asshole  who gets things done  but he's not  these guys grow up  wondering what Alice Sharpton thinks  they just wanna blow loads  they don't give a fuck  about Sharpton  it's like a religious stiff  but the second somebody  does come out  and really say something  about the fact that  there's too many illegitimate  children in the black community  they're called an Uncle Tom  they're called a fucking  puppet of the right  just everything 
[00:44:00]  that isn't  good to be  you know  instead they'd rather have  the Democrat liberal  white people drawing  on their face  response  they're laughing  one guy was fucking  holding up a paper  a paternity test paper  in this video  was he on Maury  laughing  that he's not  the fucking father  he was trying to get on Maury  he's like  I just drive by  and throw the paper  at her face  he was trying to get on Maury  yeah  come on  let's do Maury  where's Maury been 
[00:44:30]  look at this buffoon  with his gold sunglasses  and big grill  they're just having fun  yeah that's it  it's a hot summer  just kids having fun  just kids having fun  yeah that's it  blowing off a little steam  that's it  it's beyond me  that's a scary environment  I know there's a solution somewhere  but I don't have it  I'm just pointing out  the issue  and the fact that  white people drawing on their face  is not gonna fix it  because there's not  I don't think there's one way to do it  it's like everybody can  our education is the most overused 
[00:45:00]  fucking cliche  yes  but there are really  shitty stores in those neighborhoods  and no opportunity  but then again  if you go into those neighborhoods  you get fucking robbed  right  so it's hard to say  let's go build a great store  because it gets robbed  why would you want to do that  so it's like  I don't know what the solution is  it's kind of a catch-22  right Jimmy?  yeah I think so  I don't know what  I don't know what has to happen  I want to write something on my head  wow  let's write  write on your head  I want to write something on my face 
[00:45:30]  let's do the pro-black thing on our face  yes  but let's write all things about ourselves  yeah  yes  I like women with penises  I might have an anger problem  let's do it  fam  what would you write on your fucking giant forehead  I don't know  I could write a novel  no kidding man  we could put a Russian novel on that  why is it in a hurry?  Russian novels tend to be a bit thick  and wordy 
[00:46:00]  never read a Russian novel?  never  you're missing out  are they good?  yeah they're great  I don't know  it's just  it's beyond me  and I do see it as a problem  within the community  I don't like being blamed  as a white person  lumped in  to these face drawing people  for this problem  I don't  I resent it  I think a lot of people  that would look at that  unfair website 
[00:46:30]  they resent that  how do you look at that  and like  yeah  huh  you're fucking mad  why are you blaming me?  fuck you  I didn't break it  that's like words hurt though  to me  I just laugh at it  so stupid  it is stupid  just stupid  but you know what they are  it's fun to mock  you can see those guys  we immediately know  what those white people are  there's no mystery  like imagine being that  fucking delusional white asshole  who thinks it's all your fault  black people have to laugh at them too  like the black people  people are laughing at them 
[00:47:00]  I don't want to hang out  with the world star hip hop guys  we see in that video  and I don't want to hang out  with those dopey white kids  no  you would have a lot more laughs  with the black guys  hanging out with the fucking black guys  I would probably hang out  with the black guys from world star hip hop  a lot more laughs  way before those white douches  to be honest with you  right up until you get that blindside  punch to the side of the head  and stomped  stomped in the face  by twelve people  but it's preferable  to having fucking ten hipsters  tell you how racist you are  isn't it?  exactly  that you'd fucking kill yourself  as they're sipping their lattes  yeah I'd rather get beaten up  than fucking  I would put gold teeths in first 
[00:47:30]  you would do that  and then I'd go to the neighborhood  put in a grail motherfucker  make it rain  I would hang out in that neighborhood  until  somebody got rejected  for entering the party  no you can't come in  and I'd go you know what  I'm gonna go  he's coming back  he's coming back  he's coming back  you gotta be smarter  when someone's ejected from the party  it's time to leave the party  that's where you're making your mistake  if you got a family at this party  and you told the black guy  he can't come in  because of an old beef  right 
[00:48:00]  guess what  it's time to clear out  it's time to leave the old party  Jimmy said he's coming back  yes sir  and he's finding a few friends  before he comes back  holy shit  god that's good  man  can we take a break and eat  yeah let's do that  we got a heat wave to talk about  oh Kenny  Kenny I figured out what I want  it's not gonna happen  Kenny can't make that happen  he doesn't have a boat big enough  oh  we got new John Sterling  home run calls for a new guy 
[00:48:30]  oh  a new name  we like the new home run calls  I'm very excited  we got a heat wave warning  dick  remember  earthquake warning  yeah  we got a guy doing a heat wave  warning thing  and Louis CK was all over TV yesterday  yes he was  why man  promoting  oh yeah yeah  his show starts what  this Thursday or next Thursday  might be this Thursday  might be this Thursday  on FX  and Louis man  he was great on TV yesterday  because he doesn't hold back

Oh, it's probably something very powerful.  What are the lyrics of Do Hoss?  Well, if they want to go hosting, they say we should do hoss.  Let's do hoss.

This is a love song. 
[00:55:00]  Oh, no.  Who knew it was a love song?  When Till is just saying.  What?  When Till is just saying do hoss.  It sounds as if he could either be saying do hossed.  What are they doing?  Now they're trying to explain.  Wait, that's all the lyrics?  That's it, huh?  Yeah, I mean, think about it.  It doesn't really say much.  Wait, we just did all the lyrics?  That's the big hook.  Wow.  Oh.  Nine.  He's going through a situation with his gal, I believe.  Oh, boy.  So what? 
[00:55:30]  JFK did the West Berlin thing?  Yeah.  49 years ago.  If anyone hears me chewing a little bit, don't mind me.  Elvis Presley's final concert took place 35 years ago.  I saw Elvis impersonator on 72nd Street two days ago.  And he got one on the booth.  No, he was just, sorry.  He was walking with his jumpsuit on.  You know, one of those guys.  He had his guitar in his guitar case.  He was going somewhere to be an Elvis impersonator.  Really?  I felt so bad for the guy.  He had, like, the gold-rimmed sunglasses.  He had the hair. 
[00:56:00]  He looked like Elvis.  Yeah.  But he had a big wedgie up his fucking jumpsuit.  And I'm like, oh, God.  Elvis didn't look too good in his jumpsuit at the end, either.  Yeah.  So I guess this guy maybe was going with that look.  Yeah.  He was a little too chubby for his jumpsuit.  And he had the wedgie and the sunglasses.  I'm like, God, how much does this guy's life suck?  Where's he going?  Where's he going?  I didn't feel like following him.  Elvis.  Elvis.  Yeah, the impersonator.  Is that still a good business to get into? 
[00:56:30]  You know what?  Depends on where you are, but I guess so.  People are actually making money.  Vegas, it's huge.  Yeah.  Yeah, he looked really...  He looked just like that.  I think he was going with that jumpsuit.  The white one.  Ooh.  Yeah, the white one with the weird fucking belt that hangs down and everything.  Cut down to the fucking...  Oh, it was horrible.  You gotta love Elvis.  I love those Elvis jumpsuits.  And they would do it with the cape.  Like, what a fucking...  No one else like him.  What an animal.  Just to go on stage like that and not give a fuck.  How presumptuous.  Like, people want to see you like that. 
[00:57:00]  He was his own superhero.  Yeah, he really was.  He was a superhero.  A Elvis man.  Hey, are we getting Dennis Leary in for Spider-Man?  I think we were supposed to.  Roland said next week.  Who is he in Spider-Man, by the way?  Yeah, who is he in Spider-Man, by the way?  I believe he's a police officer who is the father of the girl who Spider-Man is wooing.  All right, I'm seeing Spider-Man Thursday.  And the cops are not happy with Spider-Man, so that creates a point of contention.  This is a whole new story?  Oh, yes.  Yeah, a little darker, Ed. 
[00:57:30]  Going a little darker.  All right, that's good.  I like that.  But I believe it's more...  But are we going to have to go through the beginning part where Peter Parker fucking gets bit by the spider?  I think it's a different whole thing.  It's more Twilight-y, I think.  They're going with Twilight?  Yeah, I don't think it's...  Because Twilight was so big?  I don't think it's darker.  They'll probably do a quick five minutes, this is how he became Spider-Man thing.  Yeah, real quick, probably with the opening music or something, I don't know.  It was a big part of the last one, like how he became Spider-Man.  Yeah.  Maybe he's tra-la-la-lying, all of a sudden a spider falls down and bites him and he goes, 
[00:58:00]  ups-a-daisy.  Now I got spidey senses.  Oh, the Ramstein song was about fucking a young girl.  What?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  That's what they're saying, a few people are saying that.  And then there's some other people, there's a lot of Rams, Frankenstein, Ramstein fans  out there.  And one is saying there's another video that's amazing, it's a porno basically with trannies,  cocks and all.  Can't remember the name, though.  Yeah, I bet.  That's the real Sweener. 
[00:58:30]  That's called...  On Twitter.  Jimmy knows.  Can we find the one with the tranny cocks?  If you want.  Well, I don't want.  Jesus.  I mean, the guy fucking asked for it.  What is...  He's not even here.  ...telling us about it.  That stupid bus aid, $650,000 plus the trip to Disney for her and nine of her friends.  Are people realizing now how dumb they were to give money to this?  It's slowing down.  Yeah?  The donations for the bus monitor, slowing down. 
[00:59:00]  You see...  I thought it would make a million, but it's slowing down.  It's not going to make a million.  When you see commercials for, like, St. Jude's Children's Hospital and they're trying to  get money and everything, and you realize there's $650,000 that was given to her, it's  just...  I don't understand it.  I don't understand how these people didn't see that before this bus driver was on the  news and think, like, because that's a good cause.  Maybe I should give money to that.  Because we're all idiots.  We're just idiots.  We can't think for...  We love a good soundbite and a good news story. 
[00:59:30]  We can't really think for ourselves.  What about the poor kitten with conjunctivitis and a headache bag on his head?  Fucking Patrice.  And a headache bag.  When Patrice was talking about that, poor little motherfucker got, like, conjunctivitis  and he got a little headache bag on his head looking all sad.  And you can just picture the kitten with a little headache with ice in it.  That was hilarious.  Fucking missed that motherfucker. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  Uh...  Every day.  Yeah, I don't know why we do that.  All of a sudden, you know, the Coney thing, if there's an earthquake in Japan, everyone  gets on their social networking, whether it's Twitter or Facebook or...  Yeah.  Or, what is it, Google Circles or something?  What are they doing?  I don't know.  I tried.  It just wasn't happening.  How about you just...  The Circles.  And then they're all about that for maybe 24 hours.  Yeah.  How about you just go online, right?  How about if you care...  You find a cause.  Right.  If you care as a human being right now... 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  ...don't wait for the stupid media to tell you you should donate toward this sad piece  of shit.  There's plenty of fucking people that need help.  bucks right now and send it somewhere.  Right.  Wait for some bus...  Fucking bus monitor.  Like I said, she was bullied.  It was awful.  But $650,000 plus a free trip for 10 people to Disney?  I'll take the bullying.  Man.  I say a year's pay was good enough.  Huh.  Good enough.  What is this?  The tranny video? 
[01:01:00]  Maybe.  Maybe.  Where are the cocks?  I don't think so.  Yeah, this is a bad copy.  Nah, they're hinting that there might be something wrong with these ladies.  Too small.  Seist das matter.  After all.  Too groß.  Too klein.  Er könnte etwas größer sein. 
[01:01:30]  Mercedes-Benz und Autobahn alleine in das Ausland fahren.  Reise, reise, fahren vergnügen.  Ich will nur Spaß.  Mich nicht verlieren.  Lovely legs on this gal.  I got a dumb question.  Are these guys big in the States?  I mean, we know Duhas.  Obviously.  Yeah, I think so.  He told me, my agent told me that they strolled out the garden in I think 10 minutes.  Wow.  In 10 minutes?  Yeah, I believe so.  Maybe it was, uh...  I kind of like these guys. 
[01:02:00]  I've never heard this song before.  I like this.  They're huge.  Yeah.  And they don't come here that often.  I think like every 10 years they tour the States.  That's great.  Oh, boy.  Got a bad copy.  Yeah.  Do Hoth.  How come you don't Hoth?  No, I'm not going to chew with my mouth closed.  I never eat during the show.  There was a scheduling problem with my breakfast.  I'm not going to sit here and let it get cold.  Why didn't they get your flu out of time?  So listeners can go fuck off.  Did something get lost in the translation? 
[01:02:30]  Why don't we all just...  Whoa!  Jesus!  What the fuck?  What happened?  Go back!  Wow.  Oh, there's some crazy fucking going on.  Wait a minute.  Is this a...  It's a porno.  Wait a minute.  It's the band, guys?  That was a tranny.  What the fuck is the band doing?  That's not a tranny.  It's just a girl.  There was one tranny.  Oh, there was one tranny, yeah.  Is this their video?  Yeah.  It looks like the band is actually fucking the girls. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Might be magic.  Wow.  Humshots.  Come on.  Come on.  It's the uncensored version.  That's, um...  That's Germany.  That's ballsy.  That was ballsy.  Gotta love the Germans.  As long as you don't show a swastika, they don't care.  The song's called Pussy?  They don't like that.  The song's called Pussy.  Uncensored.  Where was that?  Oh.  You should have to Google it.  Yeah.  All right.  Louis C.K. was on TV yesterday. 
[01:03:30]  Wow.  Who's that hot blonde?  I don't know, but it says,  Imus wants Carly to go get his bagel toasted.  I guess they're having a...  A little tiff?  Look at Rob Bartlett.  What is he doing?  Is he dressed like a fat beetle or something?  I think he's doing a Ringo thing again.  Wow.  That girl is all right, though.  See, she's white.  Is that an intern or something?  Oh, yeah.  Louis C.K., let's play a few of these clips.  They're fun.  Louis was on the Today Show.  Wow. 
[01:04:00]  Louis was on the Today Show.  Mm-hmm.  That's mainstream right there.  They talk about him being a household name.  You have all of this success, but you're not really a household name yet.  I shouldn't be a household name.  I'm a filthy comedian.  I deal in subjects that are not popular in every household.  A household name is like, you know, ketchup, you know.  Everybody wants ketchup.  Ketchup doesn't hurt anybody. 
[01:04:30]  You are so brilliant and so clever.  Thank you.  So, as a mother, I say to you, why do you go for the cheap joke?  Holy God, you stupid bitch.  It's not a cheap joke.  He does it very...  How about you fucking pay attention?  He's very clever when he...  Oh, God.  How can you go for the cheap joke?  Louis C.K. goes for the cheap joke?  Are you fucking serious?  But that's how people...  How about you in the media?  You're fucking idiots.  How about you fucking do a little more research? 
[01:05:00]  Well, why do you go for the fucking, the easy, cheap interview, the cheap headline?  Why don't you go to your news organization and say, why do you go for the cheap story?  Yeah.  That's enraging, man.  Louis tackles some pretty deep shit with his comedy.  They're just knee-jerk.  When they hear something that they think is offensive, they think it's cheap.  It's not.  It can be done so clever that it would make your head spin.  What pisses me off, they have a massive platform.  I don't give a fuck if they think this way in a dumb podcast or something, but it's 
[01:05:30]  a massive platform, and they don't even do their homework when these guys come in.  Louis fucking tackles deep shit.  And would she say, would she say to an actor, why do you go for the cheap roles?  Like, if she had an actor on there, she would never say, why do they go for the cheap this,  or why do you go for the cheap...  Oh, God.  It's just a dummy.  That's enraging.  Who was at the destination?  Well, well, it's because I make a lot of movies with cheap roles, and I could pay $20 million. 
[01:06:00]  Well, that's my boy did great at the box office.  I don't even know what it did.  I think it really was a bomberoo.  Was it on cable already?  Huh?  It was a bomberoo.  Another bomberoo.  But that means he'll still make at least another 10 movies.  Who was that lady, Sam?  Did you cut that up?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's one of the DC reporters.  It's not a regular Today show lady.  Oh.  It's one of the NBC reporters from Washington. 
[01:06:30]  Was Louis in Washington?  No, Louis...  They filmed it at the Comedy Cellar, actually.  Oh, okay.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  So she came up to do this?  Yep.  So they picked someone that knew comedy, obviously.  Ugh.  Yeah, right?  How did they pick someone that knows comedy?  Ugh.  This is enraging.  How do they respond to that?  Uh, that's...  I don't know.  Punched her in the cunt.  Yeah.  And he made fart sounds.  How much did that's my boy make?  So far, it's made $27.9 million.  In two weeks, right?  Yeah, and it's...  So you take my pay out of it, and it's just $7 million left. 
[01:07:00]  Seven?  What are you kidding?  Yeah, the production budget, and this was not exactly an action-packed movie, was $70 million.  Wow.  Wow.  The sad part is, even though it's a major bomb for Adam Sandler, it'll still make money.  Hmm.  I don't know.  I mean, that's tough.  When you factor in everything, this movie will not lose money.  It's got $40 million still to go.  Okay.  It'll make money in DVDs.  It makes...  And the downloads, the digital downloads, all that shit. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, Sam.  Stop being a hater.  I hate who's going to hate.  It's true.  Thank you.  So as a mother, I say to you, why do you go for the cheap joke?  You know, why do you have to do the filthy stuff?  Well, first of all, anybody who thinks those are easy laughs, go ahead and try to get those laughs.  Thank you.  Thank you, Louie.  That's great.  And he handled it very intelligently.  Thank you.  I was scared.  Of course you knew Louie had something to say to that.  Joe, you know, why do you have to do the filthy stuff? 
[01:08:00]  Well, first of all, anybody who thinks those are easy laughs, go ahead and try to get those laughs.  They're not easy.  There's no such thing as a cheap laugh.  They all cost something.  And it's cost me a lot, being dirty.  I don't know.  I do have some ambivalence about it because I've had fantasies of, like, doing a special that's pure clean.  Yeah, it'll be fun to do that someday.  God, she stinks.  No, but he's good.  This is why Louie is very smart.  Because he handled it without anger. 
[01:08:30]  It's kind of what I admire about Colin, too.  It's this ability to be funny without getting so riled up and crazy about it.  He handled that great, man.  Yeah, he really did.  I would have been annoyed and self-righteous.  Please.  But, you know, he just, but he made her look stupid.  And you forget, like, you don't have to yell to make someone look stupid.  It's not easy.  And all she could say at that point was, ah.  Yeah.  Why do you have to do the dirty stuff?  He should have said cheap.  What are you, a bird or something?  Ah, see? 
[01:09:00]  Cheap, cheap.  Yep.  The conversation continued.  I'm going to say two words.  Sarah Palin.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's caused me some problems that I wrote s*** about her.  But I also, why not, man?  I mean, what is she?  She's just a person.  I don't think she's some sacred person.  And to me, I was writing poems.  It was like poetry to me.  And I enjoyed writing.  He's ripping me off.  Would you do it again?  Would I do it again?  Yeah, I probably would.  I think so.  It still makes me laugh a little bit, the stuff that I wrote when I think about it. 
[01:09:30]  I thought it was well written.  That excuses it.  Yes.  If it's clever and the timing is good.  Sure, well, that gives it value.  Oh, God.  She's so hateable.  But you know what?  Isn't she hateable?  Yes, but here's why she's good.  Because she's asking questions that he's answering really well.  Right.  So almost like, it's almost like she's so dumb, she's softballing questions.  She really is.  And she's not attacking him.  Yep.  Why the cheap joke? 
[01:10:00]  Boom.  And he has a great answer.  Would you do it so that makes it okay?  Yes.  Yes.  Here's why.  She's giving him these little, sometimes you want somebody to ask something slightly confrontational.  So you can give the answer you want to it.  Yeah.  Louie also is very, he's a likable guy when he sits down like that for an interview.  I find him to be very unlikable and slightly queer.  I think he comes across to these interviewers and stuff as a very likable kind of guy. 
[01:10:30]  You know, it's not like a dice.  When dice would sit down for an interview, it would be confrontational.  Right.  The gays don't like you, dice.  Whatever.  Oh, your misogynistic attitude towards, like, it's not like they want to grill Louie.  He's just a fun guy sitting there.  I just hate that she's not prepared to talk to Louie CK.  She's completely prepared.  That's how she really thinks.  She thinks a dirty joke is not a funny joke.  She's been conditioned that way.  And that's how she really thinks. 
[01:11:00]  You know what?  You're probably right.  You're probably right.  Louie then went on the Tonight Show.  Oh, today, tonight.  What about, like, this afternoon or something?  Home run.  Call me a home run.  Oh, please.  Oh, God.  No.  That's so stupid. 
[01:11:30]  Jimmy.  That is probably the most heterosexual outfit I've ever seen you on right now.  You look like a man who tried to dress himself.  It is.  This is.  How is he dressed?  He was dressed in his typical black sweatshirt on.  Yeah, Louie doesn't dress up.  This is it.  I mean, is it.  Well, you look like a cop.  Is it inside out?  I do.  You look like you're protecting the president.  Well, this is my job.  This is my uniform.  I know.  You are, by the way, you are, and I don't, I hope I can say this without insulting you. 
[01:12:00]  Yes.  You're, no, you're the weirdest looking person on the planet Earth.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That doesn't, no, that doesn't insult me at all.  That's very kind.  I don't mean that as a negative.  No, no, not at all.  It's just nobody, I can't describe you.  It's just the fact that I have a full head of hair.  That's what's telling you.  Well, thank you.  Oh, man.  I don't mean that in a bad way.  No, no, I don't.  Wow.  Don't take that the wrong way.  I'm not.  It's just that I just don't have to cover my chin because I'm proud of it.  But no, it's not. 
[01:12:30]  Jake.  Wow.  Fuck you.  Wow.  You forget.  You totally forget.  You know that Jake can fucking fight back.  Of course.  You spent many years on stage, too.  Of course.  He comes across as a nice guy, but don't push him too far.  Yeah.  That's beautiful.  I like it.  I like it.  He later hit him in the parking lot with a Dusseldorf.  Exactly.  Jake broke down doing nine miles an hour on the way home.  Nine miles an hour.  That is fucking, yeah.  Ran out of steam pressure.  Wow. 
[01:13:00]  This is great.  Because I'm proud of it.  Oh, no.  It's not.  Jake.  Oh, no.  Go ahead.  Jake, if you weren't famous and you robbed a bank and the dude was describing you to like  a police sketch artist, he'd be like, no, seriously, what did he look like?  Nobody.  Nobody looks like this.  Nobody looks like you.  I can't believe I'm looking at you all the time.  I'm looking at you.  Holy shit. 
[01:13:30]  And if you robbed a bank, what?  I'd keep the money and be happy.  No, I'd say that.  I'd be good at it.  You'd just say, it's Mr. Potato Head.  And they would go, oh.  All right.  All right.  Going at each other a little bit there.  That's good.  Keep it up fun, though.  Yeah, two Boston guys.  Yeah, two Boston guys, right.  Keep it up fun.  That are very good at their craft.  So you think women are better than men, do you think?  Well, I mean, I don't think women are better than men.  Men are a lot worse than women, though. 
[01:14:00]  Like, there's no, there's not even a comparison.  Like, some people try to say, no, women cause, no, nothing.  It doesn't even touch the mayhem of just male nonsense and violence.  The worst thing you can say about a woman is that she's annoying to a guy.  That's the worst thing.  Men are so hard.  Like a woman, you could say, my mom makes me feel stupid.  Oh, really?  My husband murdered me.  Right.  It's just a whole different, yeah. 
[01:14:30]  You know?  That would be worth it.  Kim Kardashian's annoying.  Really?  Hitler killed everybody.  There's not...  Yeah, that's an interesting...  There's not...  Even when you hear of a guy who's a great guy, he's an amazing guy.  He's a big community activist.  He's a good guy.  And then it turns out he's just been molesting kids for years.  Just years.  Just tons.  It's always tons of kids.  Like, nobody gets found guilty of one count.  Right, right, right.  It's always, like, 50 or 100. 
[01:15:00]  He's just been doing it.  Like, when did he have time to coach?  Like, when did he have time to do his job?  Wow.  Wow.  The most impressive thing is how good that offense was, considering how much time that  dude spent.  Wow.  How good would Penn State be if that guy wasn't wasting his time?  Yeah.  But it went on for so long that nobody...  By the time they caught him, he was done.  He was like, ah, I'm sick of it anyway.  Like, he didn't even... 
[01:15:30]  Holy shit.  It was so smart.  Because he only said, like, molesting kids once.  Yes.  And after that, he didn't say anything.  Yes.  Smart, man.  Yeah.  Wow.  Great appearance by Luke.  That was very funny.  He doesn't need to hear that from me, but that's a great one right now.  Very, very funny.  New show starts Thursday on FX.  What?  10.30, I think?  Yeah.  10 or 10.30.  I always forget it.  Oh, you want to feel old?  What happened?  David Wells is going to be in the old-timers game.  No.  Stop.  That's silly. 
[01:16:00]  What the fuck, man?  Really?  Yeah.  He's talking about the old-timers game.  When was the last time he pitched?  How many years ago is it now?  I think it's got to be at least five.  I remember we saw him coming out of a hotel in Boston while we were up there doing something.  That seemed like yesterday, and he was up there because he was pitching for the year.  2004.  2004 was it for him?  Eight years.  Eight years.  Remember we had him in at N.E.W.?  He was great.  He was great.  I thought he would come back by now. 
[01:16:30]  Man.  He should be on our show talking about old-timers day.  Who else is playing?  Is Yogi Berra going to play?  I don't know.  What does he manage?  What does he do?  He comes out.  He gives a little wave.  How that motherfucker is still like...  I hate the old-timers game with the, well, let's say Yankees in this case, and the old  guys with their baggy uniforms.  It's so depressing.  They got to wear the old baggy uniforms.  Really baggy.  What do you got, Travis?  Yeah.  I don't think David Wells is doing well because he had to auction off that Babe Ruth hat that 
[01:17:00]  he pitched the perfect game on.  Oh, no.  Maybe he was done with the hat, though.  You think someone's just done with a Babe Ruth authentic hat?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I think Wells made a lot of money.  Oh, well.  A lot of these athletes make a lot of money and then...  Spend a lot of money.  Yeah, spend a lot of money.  Yeah.  I don't think I would just auction off my Babe Ruth hat.  That'd probably be the last thing I own.  I'd put on, like, a Babe Ruth jersey and then eat, like, sloppy...  What was it?  Chicken wings? 
[01:17:30]  Sign fuck?  Yeah, of course.  I was trying to get fired.  When is the old-timers game?  Uh, it's this weekend, I think.  Old-timers game.  Yeah, July 1st.  Who's playing?  The Usual Suspects, Yogi Berra, Reggie Jackson.  Reggie?  Yeah.  Whitey Ford, Goose Gossage.  Whitey Ford still around?  You skipped over one.  Rod Goodry.  Ron Guidry is zilch.  Oh, my God.  I don't know who it is.  Why did you say that?  You knew he couldn't get it.  Yeah, I'm reading it.  What's his name, Sam?  Go ahead.  Guidry?  Say it again.  Ron Guidry? 
[01:18:00]  All right, there you go.  Yeah, I don't know who he is.  I'm going to wait.  Yeah, I don't know who he is.  He was one of my childhood heroes, Ron Guidry.  But Sam, he owns it.  I love it.  Yeah, I don't know.  You don't give a fuck.  You don't know who he is, right?  Why do I care who Ron Guidry is?  You don't give a fuck.  Louisiana Lightning.  That's right.  Still don't give a fuck.  Fucking mowed down 18 California angels.  Fucking lefty with the mustache.  What was his number?  Enjoy someone with the mustache.  I'm going to go with...  Ooh, I don't know.  He had a very distinct and crisp wind-up. 
[01:18:30]  Like a perfect landing motion.  See if you can find Ron Guidry throwing a pitch.  He had a perfect set-up and throw where he wound up just in great fielding position.  He'd be facing the plate, right?  I loved Ron Guidry, yeah.  There he is.  I don't need to see him talking now.  I just kind of...  Don't tell me they don't have footage.  We met Ron Guidry, didn't we?  A lot of times they don't have permission.  They don't have permission to air like video clips, so they just put fucking still pictures.  He looks like Robert Goulet.  Can we find a photo of Ron Guidry instead of awful... 
[01:19:00]  I mean, a video?  I wanted a video of him throwing a pitch, and Sam comes back with a montage from his living room.  Fucking spit on Sam.  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  Yeah, what's wrong with you?  Just saying.  What's wrong with you?  You're numb.  Cute.  Dorful.  Oh, God.  This isn't going to work either, Sam.  More photos?  Sam, this ain't going to work.  There's more photos. 
[01:19:30]  How do they not have rights on the Yes Network?  Yeah, the Yes Network.  This ain't going to work.  Major League Baseball owns it, right?  That's fucking...  Why do you do the documentary if you can't show Ron Guidry footage?  Just do a reenactment.  Just blur it up so you can't see the guy's face.  Have a guy with a mustache, and then you make it all blurry.  And just show him...  I love the reenactments of shit like that.  No team name on the hat.  It's not you.  They'll zoom in on the arm and the baseball and the glove and the dust popping out of the glove. 
[01:20:00]  Terrible camera angles.  Yes, I hate that shit.  It's like, was the cameraman laying in the fucking under the catcher's crotch to shoot that?  You know who else is at Old Timers Day this year?  Who?  For the first time?  Tanyan Sturtz.  You remember Tanyan Sturtz?  No, I don't know.  I do remember the name Tanyan, yeah.  Tanyan Sturtz.  Remember Tanyan?  He played with the Yankees?  Yeah.  No idea.  He spent too much time in the sun.  Take the ball and run with it.  Who is he?  He was a pitcher in the late 90s.  You know who this guy is? 
[01:20:30]  I remember Tanyan.  I do.  Because I remember the name was weird.  I don't remember him at all.  Yes, idiot.  He's not that old.  He's 41.  Oh, come on.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Jamie Moyer's still pitching, and he's 49.  Old timers.  Jamie Moyer?  Wait, who picked him up?  I thought he went down in the minors.  Jamie Moyer was just released by the Orioles.  But he was released by...  He was released by the Rockies.  Rockies.  The Orioles picked him up.  And released him already.  He has to be released, because I don't think that there was any immediate plans to bring  him up.  He really wants to pitch, so...  49.  He pitched for the Mariners, too, didn't he? 
[01:21:00]  He's pitched for like 10 teams.  I think...  Did I beat him?  No.  49.  So, when did his career start?  Probably 20.  27 years ago, let's call it, maybe?  Yeah, probably.  So, 27 years ago, was it 85?  Is my math right?  Right?  He started in like around 1985?  I read a stat that he's faced 10% of the batters ever in baseball.  What?  That he's...  No, I know.  Yeah, that's crazy.  That was more of a reaction.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  10% of the batters ever.  But is that going back to 1850? 
[01:21:30]  Since they've been keeping records.  Yes.  That's numerically, right?  Since they're record keeping.  Not that actually many different batters.  No, is it 10% of people who have had an at-bat in the major leagues he's faced?  Fuck.  Wow.  That does mean that 90% he hasn't.  Yes, that's true, Jim.  It is going to hate.  Wow.  We got new home run calls.  If we're talking baseball, this would be a good spot to do this.  John Sterling.  Yeah, you got a new...  This is a good one.  People seem to embrace it. 
[01:22:00]  What's the guy's name who hit the home run?  Dwayne Wise.  Dwayne.  Dwayne Wise.  Dwayne Wise.  Dwayne Wise.  As a wise man once said, Dwayne!  Dwayne the ball!  Oh, Dwayne!  You know, the Yankees embrace it, though.  I went to a Yankees game, and when they win,  they put his big, fat, fucking, fat, you know,  his mug up on the big screen, and he just...  But it's pre-recorded, you can tell. 
[01:22:30]  He pre-recorded to play every time the Yankees win.  It's like he's their de facto mascot.  What a Weisenheimer!  But he stinks!  Why do they do...  How dumb is that organization?  You still have that news clip that I pulled last week.  Oh, you know what?  Can we get that again?  I want that Sterling!  Keep him doing what he does!  I don't have it.  He's fantastic!  Iraq, can you get that?  Because the local news did a piece on him,  and they embrace him, too.  What I don't understand is the Yankees are known  for being a classy organization,  so why would you have a goofball?  Yeah, he's a clown. 
[01:23:00]  You know, there's other teams that aren't considered classy,  so, you know, maybe do it for one of those teams.  I don't know.  Maybe this new home run call will turn you around.  Pride of the Yankees.  Let's remember.  Pride of the Yankees.  Hell, I've been once said...  Here's Dwayne Wise.  He hits his first home run for the Yankees.  There'll be a 1-2 to Chavez.  Chavez.  Not to Chavez, to Wise.  And he drills one at deep right.  It is high!  It is far!  It is gone! 
[01:23:30]  Dwayne Wise getting a rare start.  Hits one over the auxiliary scoreboard in right center.  Great.  Oh, that's a very wise man.  A two-run home run.  And the Yankees take a 4-0 lead.  You know what his crutch is?  What?  Before the goofy part.  No!  No!  Because like Jimmy said, great.  It was perfect to that point.  There's nothing wrong with that home run call.  It doesn't make sense.  Oh, well, here I go.  Why is he a wise man? 
[01:24:00]  Yes.  Because he hit a home run.  I don't get that.  You could be so stupid.  What do you mean?  The other guys aren't wise enough to want to hit a home run?  No, the other guys aren't.  It's like, oh, boy.  I don't know what I should do up here with the bat.  The wise part was he was guessing fastball.  I think he's throwing a fucking fastball right here.  I've got to get ready.  Oh, man.  So that's where the wizardry is.  I know.  I'm not buying it.  That's a dumb one.  Cano.  Cano homered.  You want to hear this one?  Of course.  Ronnie Cano!  Don't you know?  Don't you know?  Well, he had a little shout-out in this one.  No! 
[01:24:30]  He does his typical Cano home run call, and then he has a little shout-out.  No, it's before, but you'll hear it.  The pitch to Cano is inside.  We'll have a moment.  We, Susan and I both park in the same garage, and I just wanted to give a little shout-out  to Rafael, who does such a great job with all the cars, and is great to us.  The 1-0.  Swung on and hit in the air to deep right.  That ball is high.  It is far.  It is gone!  That man is red-hot. 
[01:25:00]  He homers into the right field seat.  Robbie Cano.  A don't you know?  Another Cano home run, and the Yankees have a 5-0 lead.  A don't you know, he calls it?  A don't you know?  Robbie Cano.  A don't you know?  He fucking stinks.  He parked that one up in the stands like I park my car in the garage.  I feel like Susan Park's potato salad in her wig.  Fucking awful wig. 
[01:25:30]  Phil Rizzuto will always be the best.  Even he was a babbling asshole.  Like, Cora said, eh, in his money store commercial.  No, the money store.  We were a school to.  Literally last night, he would talk about his dinners.  Yeah.  He barely talked about the game.  That's why it was great.  Yeah, there's a three-run home run.  He's talking about how, you know, fucking chippy the maitre d'e.  Phil Rizzuto.  The money store.  The last home run call on that CD really shows how self-centered he is. 
[01:26:00]  Oh.  Do you think he's self-centered?  No.  Oh, self-obsessed.  You think?  Yes.  Phil Rizzuto.  The scooter.  Got bad this commercial.  The money store.  And the 2-2.  Swisher hits a high fly down the left field line.  Cutting to the corner is Damon.  At the wall, he leaps.  It's gone.  It just got in the seats down the line inside the pole.  Damon gave a leap and went right into the first row.  Perfect. 
[01:26:30]  Johnny Damon?  What was wrong with that?  No.  Damon tried to catch the ball.  No.  Was that Johnny Damon?  Oh.  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah.  They were playing Cleveland.  I think he's on Cleveland.  What was wrong with our club?  That was fine.  Nothing.  Keep going.  You've got a while to go.  Oh, there's more.  You've got a long way to go.  Nick is positively swish-a-licious.  Another Yankee home run.  And the Yankees have taken a 6-0 lead.  For Nick, boy, is he having a year.  He is.  He's always great.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, John.  All right, Nick's having a year, John. 
[01:27:00]  Some year, John.  Does he give her anything?  Just wait.  Okay.  You know, John.  Stupid Boston accent.  Why would the Yankees allow that?  Nothing lead.  For Nick, boy, is he having a year.  He is having his greatest year.  That was his 12th home run.  Saturday, he got his 1,000th hit of his career.  Everything going well for him.  Fastball, 2-2 count on the outside part of the plate.  And the fourth time in the season, Yankees have hit back-to-back home runs.  Pitches hit deep and fouled by Mondas. 
[01:27:30]  Yes, that's true.  Cano and Swisher go back-to-back.  And a belly-to-belly.  Oh, he has to get it in.  Because he missed it.  He missed it.  He totally forgot until she brought it up.  And Susan brought it up.  The next batter's already at the plate, and he had to do it.  He had to go back.  You know, John, you didn't say belly-to-belly.  John, do the belly-to-belly thing.  I like that.  John, what are you talking about? 
[01:28:00]  Nick Swisher's perfect season.  You didn't do back-to-back.  And Robbie Cano, no, belly-belly.  Bernie goes boom.  Why do I sound like Ted Sheckler?  Roberts and Caruso or something.  No, Chip Sheckler-Waldman.  Chip Waldman.  Belly-to-belly.  What are they kissing or something?  John Sterling.  How come you're not John Gold or something?  Big thank you to Chris Osborne on the Twitter. 
[01:28:30]  We were talking about Jamie Moyer.  Ready for this?  The first pitcher he went against, anyone want to guess?  A legend.  A fucking Hall of Famer.  I'm going to guess Jim Palmer.  What team is he on, Jamie Moyer, when he does it?  What year is it?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know who...  What team did Jamie Moyer start with?  I don't know.  Seattle?  First pitcher he got, it was about 85?  Now a Hall of Famer.  One of the greatest...  Nolan Ryan.  Yeah, I'll say Nolan Ryan.  Go lefty.  Lefty?  Go lefty. 
[01:29:00]  Left...  Oil can.  Left throwing Hall of Famer.  Oh God, Randy Johnson.  One of the best ever.  You got to go Steve Carlton.  Yep.  Got to go Steve Carlton.  Where'd you get the answer, you motherfucker?  Right off of Paltop.  For the Phillies.  I guess he started the National League then.  Started with the Cubs.  And here's the deal.  Steve Carlton is 67 years old.  Wow.  And Moyer went against him.  First time he pitched.  I'm assuming Chris Oxburg, by the way, has got his info right. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah, perhaps.  Dude, it cuts you the asshole.  He also pitched against 11 current managers.  Wow.  I guess Joe Girardi and...  I don't know.  Mike Socha.  What was his relationship with Louis T on?  Quick.  Google.  Oh, that fucking side wine delivery used to drive me nuts.  We all did that, though, with our wiffle balls.  Oh, the side pitch for a wiffle ball.  We all tried the Louis T on.  Yep.  That was weird.  Could you get a video of Louis T on doing the Sidewinder?  Sure.  What was it called?  There was...  The Dipsy Doodle? 
[01:30:00]  The Dipsy fucking Doodle.  Dipsy Doodle.  A Dinka Dinka Dipsy Doodle.  Dude, I thought of that fucking Dinka Dinka Do song for hours.  Terrible.  Terrible.  I used bro's name.  A Dinka Do.  What did you do that?  L-U-I-S-T-I-A-N-T-I-A-N-S.  Thousand Stockings.  Not Dur...  Not Durary.  No.  A Dink.  A Dinka Do.  I Dink.  A Thousand Stockings.  The most bit is to find another fucking song he ever sang. 
[01:30:30]  Yeah.  I think he only sang one song.  Oh.  We can find him, but not Guidry.  This was ridiculous.  Wow, that's weird.  You think that fucked up his back?  God, he's like a snake.  He would do that weird stop.  That's got to hurt.  That's got to hurt some fucking discs in the lower back.  Hey, my nine here in New York did a whole John Sterling piece. 
[01:31:00]  My nine?  And no one will call him out for being kind of silly.  Do they love him?  They love him.  No, you just wait.  He's known as the radio voice of the New York Yankees.  John Sterling has been calling games for more than 20 years.  And fans have become accustomed to his catch phrases, especially when a bomber hits a home run.  So, does he come up?  How does he come up with all those nicknames?  Duke Castiglione is at the stadium right now.  It's a really difficult process.  Well, what happens is I think of murdering Susan and a name just pops into my head. 
[01:31:30]  She probably throws the worst ideas at him.  How about Robinson Caruso Cano?  No, no, that's not good.  No, that's not a good one.  How about have a wise potato chip home run?  No, Susan.  Just shut the fuck up.  Just shut up.  Don't.  And hope it doesn't come back.  Yeah, she probably gives him horrible suggestions and he just...  No.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Susan, what are you doing crumbling up that newspaper?  Well, John, I get it. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  Now, the...  Sorry.  Here's my nine piece.  Duke Castiglione is at the stadium right now with more on this story for us.  Hi there, Duke.  You know, Brendan, he has never missed a game in his tenure as the Yankees broadcaster.  Why are you talking like that?  That, as John would say, is amazing.  And if you know, John, you know he has a passion for what he does.  A passion.  And that comes through.  Very evident when he makes those great home run goals.  Great. 
[01:32:30]  Swung on in.  Hit in the air.  The deep center.  And it's gone.  Bernie Williams.  Burn, baby, burn.  Ah.  Burn, baby, burn.  I think the first one was Bernie Williams.  You know, burn, baby, burn.  And Bernie goes boom.  And then I added a couple more.  You know what?  Then I added it.  Let me tell you how that happened.  True story.  Very funny.  You kids stay in school.  To be fair, like, I don't know, burn, Bernie, burn.  Okay. 
[01:33:00]  Burn, baby, burn.  All right.  It was a moment that he just, you know, he didn't overthink it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it seemed, hearing that, it seems to work.  It seemed natural at least.  Right.  But the problem is then he decided I need a home run call for everyone.  And I think that's the issue here.  Yeah.  Every single fucking person has to have their special home run call now.  You think there's a book after all this?  Oh, God, yeah.  Explaining how he got everyone.  More than just a word.  More than just a call.  More than just a name.  Yeah.  I'm more than just a douche. 
[01:33:30]  And Bernie goes boom.  And then I added a couple more.  Just as they came to mind.  Bamtino.  Well, now it's become a cottage industry.  It sure has.  No, it's not.  I mean, come on.  It's not a cottage industry.  Come on.  Come on.  This guy doing the fucking story is a dick.  Come on.  Cottage industry.  It's not a cottage industry.  They don't make houses and sell them.  Or maybe they make the cheese.  Home run chipper.  Burn chippy burn. 
[01:34:00]  I wish.  Yeah.  Why don't you wish on a star or something, you cocksucker?  Holy Jesus.  He says shit.  Sorry, Chip.  God.  I never get Chip that angry.  He has a googly-eyed fuck on MSNBC.  Jesus Christ.  What way is he looking?  Wow.  Oh, that's the Christian Bale.  You know, look at him.  He's gone on.  He's won a championship.  And I will have to say, I have to give him a lot of respect.  Last year, he was so reluctant to take the ball to the basket.  This year, he was so reluctant to shoot jump shots. 
[01:34:30]  And it took a lot of mental strength.  And I give him credit.  Where does he rank?  Guys you go up against the league.  Raw talent.  Best player.  He's, he's, overall, he's the best player.  Can he get that fixed?  I mean, what he can do.  But Kobe still, you know, is, is deadly, deadly.  What's his name?  Killer.  Killer.  Huh?  Yeah, Steve Nash.  Thank you.  You know, but LeBron's younger.  He's big.  You know, fucking LeBron just had a great, great playoff run.  Fuck.  Completely different player this year.  Oh, yeah?  Completely. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  A lot more confidence.  I want to hear the rest of that piece.  Industry.  It sure has.  I mean, come on.  What Yankee fan hasn't heard or even tried to imitate a John Sterling home run call?  Your favorites are the ones that get repeated.  Because then you know it's caught on.  I would say A-bomb for A-Rod.  It's an A-bomb from A-Rod.  Sometimes, though, a Yankee player will ask John to change his home run call. 
[01:35:30]  As he asked right fielder Nick Swisher did.  The first time that he hit a home run, I said, he's jolly old St. Nick.  And he came to me on the road and said, don't use that.  It makes me look like a little old fat man.  So I came up with the Swisher-licious.  Cut on and hit him there to deep right.  That ball is gone.  Positively, the Swisher-licious.  Fans and, yes, even sportswriters give him ideas for home run calls.  But many of them he comes up with on his own.  Wow.  Robbie Cano. 
[01:36:00]  Don't you know.  There are people who have come to me and said, that's my favorite one.  And those of us that listen to the broadcast all have our personal favorites.  Did he cure cancer?  Is that what?  The Curtis Granderson home run call.  And that ball is gone.  Curtis, you're something sort of grandish.  The Grandy Man can.  The Grandy Man can.  A lot of the players imitate the calls.  And I've been on an elevator with a lot of players.  You know, we're in a hotel.  Which the cable snaps.  And they do all my calls.  Yeah, I wish it was in a fucking towering Inferno elevator. 
[01:36:30]  God, I think we're in the minority here.  I can't believe it.  Everyone seems to like it.  Except us.  Even the players like it.  Oh, God.  I don't understand.  You're not in the minority.  The Grandy Man can.  A player that's 27 people.  I think we're in the minority, man.  They play at a Yankee Stadium.  They don't have to listen to it either.  They listen occasionally, but they don't hear the whole game.  Yeah, they're actually in the game.  They're playing it.  I wouldn't mind it if once in a while, when I came off stage, he was like,  And I'm the naughty norted tonight. 
[01:37:00]  The naughty norted.  Oh, Jimnasium.  I would probably enjoy that.  Because I wouldn't have to hear it.  What did he say?  Oh, Jimynastics.  Oh, Jimny was cracking corn.  But I don't care.  Jimny was cracking corn, John.  And Sam and Anthony were sitting there.  And Opie had his headphones on.  The pitch.  He gets nothing. 
[01:37:30]  He gets nothing.  Come on, John.  I want to be part of the fun.  Yeah.  I was so excited, I sneezed.  And my wig was all crooked on my face.  You remember that, John?  When a foul ball hit me in the forehead?  That pitch high and wide for ball, too.  Yeah.  Carlos, the parking garage attendant.  Yeah, he'd rather talk about the parking lot attendant than have any fucking conversation  with Susan Wallman. 
[01:38:00]  Because he's sick of waiting for his car, so he told the unclipped Carlos,  I'll throw you a mention on 880 if you get my car before this fucking...  Get it fast so I don't have to stand there and talk to this cunt.  I guarantee you.  What are you doing this weekend, John?  They'd probably sit there while he got the car, and he would probably bring her car first,  and she would sit there and wait for John to get his car.  Hey, how about what you said?  I love what you said, that that car...  And he's just like, oh, shut the fuck up.  Shouldn't you be getting home?  Don't you have...  You think he tries to sneak out? 
[01:38:30]  I hope you hit a wall, man.  Yeah.  ...in a hotel, and we're getting into our rooms, and they do all my calls.  They sure do.  But as Swisher told us, it's not the home run calls he likes most.  It's this one in particular.  Which one?  The Yankees win!  The Yankees win!  Oh, no.  He didn't?  It was a lot of fun doing that piece.  Obviously, John's very into the home run calls, and he's right. 
[01:39:00]  The players do impersonations of the home run calls as well.  But as I said, their favorite call John has is the Yankees win.  That is the story from down here in the field.  Brenda, let's send it back to you.  I think that's all our favorites.  Thank you.  It may be off-season for pro football...  And Brenda, let's send it back to you.  Who the fuck talks like that?  I don't know.  I don't get it.  Duke Castiglione.  What's his name?  Was that Duke?  Yeah.  You guys didn't like that. 
[01:39:30]  I thought you were going to like it.  I didn't even care for that.  We're wrong.  People enjoy it.  No, they're dummies.  They're wrong.  We're taking their fun away.  Fuck their fun.  Taking their fun away.  Killjoy.  We're killjoys.  Speaking of baseball, Jimmy's favorite is celebrating his 38th birthday today.  Was Jeter 38?  38 for Jeter.  Jeter.  Wow.  Damn.  How many years do you think he's got left? 
[01:40:00]  Oh, he's just about done.  Yeah.  Probably the end of this contract.  Damn.  What did he sign?  A two-year?  I don't know.  Will anybody not vote for him in the Hall of Famers first?  He's got to be.  He's got to be.  There will be people that won't vote for him the first time.  Why?  Because there's a lot of sports writers who feel that nobody's ever gotten 100%, like  even Babe Ruth when he was first inducted.  So a lot of people feel that nobody should get 100%.  Yeah, because they want to.  How about they just vote on merit?  They want to be different.  Yeah, stop worrying about what happened in the past.  I've got to be different.  Yeah, if you think you should be in the Hall of Fame, then just do that. 
[01:40:30]  The only person that they don't.  Don't overthink it because Babe Ruth didn't get 100%.  That's ridiculous.  Even, I think, I think Ripken.  So what, do they have a talk among themselves like, hey, this time around, you've got to  be the guy.  Joel?  That doesn't vote him at all.  No, Ripken.  I think Ripken and Tom Seaver are tied for the highest percentage.  Joel Ripken?  Yes.  Wow.  What percentage?  I think it was like 91%.  The fact that there's 10% of people that wouldn't vote for fucking him.  Ripken's first fucking ballot Hall of Famer.  That's what I just said. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  That's hilarious.  Wow.  I love that.  It happens.  Yeah.  I love that.  But they didn't make public what Lou Gehrig got, so maybe he got 100%.  He got that disease.  Why would they make it public?  Because they inducted him early, because he was dying.  Who?  Lou Gehrig.  I'm dying over here.  So they had a special vote, and they've never made those.  Because some asshole said no.  Maybe, but I mean, you know.  That's the only reason they didn't say he died.  Why would they make that public? 
[01:41:30]  I don't know, because it was a quick.  Oh, God.  Stop taking yourself so seriously.  Make it public now.  Jesus, who cares?  What about Joel Ripken?  What happened to him?  They're not declassifying baseball fucking Hall of Fame votes, but please.  Why?  Yeah, what happened?  The Russians even handed over that KAL 007 black box.  Jesus.  Ripken got 98.5.  But there had to be somebody who was different. 
[01:42:00]  Someone had to be different.  I'm not voting.  Who was the different guy?  They don't know.  Those aren't made public.  Well, why aren't they made public?  It should be made public.  A lot of sports writers will make their own vote public, like after the fact.  They'll say, yeah, I voted for him.  But if you have to be the asshole, that has to be different, and you know, like on YouTube  and stuff, they have to dislike just to be the asshole, then your name should be public.  I don't disagree.  Or you should just fucking say, yeah, it's me.  I'm the fucking asshole.  Obviously, he should be a first ballot Hall of Famer, but I felt like I needed to be different. 
[01:42:30]  Well, a lot of people just feel that, you know, nobody deserves to be a first ballot Hall of  Famer, so I just won't vote this year, and that's what happens.  Oh, they don't vote?  Yeah.  Yeah, they'll just abstain from voting.  So why does their vote count as anything?  It should be zero percent.  How do you get a vote?  Baseball writer?  I'm a baseball writer.  Well, just because you write things about baseball on a piece of paper doesn't make  you a baseball writer.  Snob.  I just Googled that guy.  What guy?  Joel Rickon?  No, the guy with the mustache. 
[01:43:00]  Robert Goulet.  Yeah, what about him?  I wrote his name down.  I'm a baseball writer.  Oh.  Sam's a baseball writer, too.  Yeah.  What makes you a qualified baseball writer?  Me?  Oh, yeah.  I think you're not a qualified baseball writer.  I didn't say nothing.  For this thing.  You have to be part of the Baseball Writers Association.  And you have to write for a major publication for at least five years.  You know this?  Yes.  Jimmy's lying.  He started smiling.  I know.  I love it. 
[01:43:30]  It sounded good.  That one sounded good.  It really did.  Oh, fuck it.  Regardless, he'll be a first ballot Hall of Famer.  Irregardless.  The dumb people that have to just be different when it's so obvious the guy should be in  the Hall of Fame.  That's ridiculous.  What the hell?  That's ridiculous.  Those guys should be called out by the rest of the writers.  They should be.  It's fraud.  It's like, what are you doing?  You're absolutely a fraud.  You're just doing it to be different.  Yeah, that's not honest.  How do you sit there and go, yeah, Cal Ripken shouldn't be a first ballot Hall of Famer?  I agree.  He was the greatest baseball player of all time. 
[01:44:00]  No, he wasn't.  He was a great player, but.  Let's calm down, Travis.  Wow.  Fucking, and who cares about Babe Ruth?  That was then.  Stupid.  Maybe there was a guy who was, because some asshole was biased back then.  If you want to live by the same rules, I guess Jackie Robinson shouldn't be in.  Stupid dopes.  Jesus.  He broke the color barrier.  Did he?  I hope he got, hold the top.  I messed up.  Oh.  I was getting nervous doing racial stuff.  Damn it. 
[01:44:30]  All right, you know what?  Todd in Indiana.  First phone call of the day, Todd.  So you better make it fucking good.  Well, thank you, boys.  These assholes.  Roberto Clemente, last hit of his career was his 3,000th.  He was on his way Christmas Eve to bring toys and food to earthquake victims in his native country.  The plane crashed and he died.  And 26 of these motherfuckers didn't put him in on the first ballot. 
[01:45:00]  But that's why these guys got to be called out.  You can't be unanimous.  More than 26.  I'm reading 31.  31.  You can't be anonymous if you're that much of an asshole.  What was his?  Yeah, and people should know.  You can't.  What was his, by the way, what was his?  What was the reason why they voted against him going into the Hall of Fame?  You don't have to give a reason.  You just vote or you don't vote.  But what do you think as a baseball fan?  What didn't he do right?  And by the way, 3,000 hits is, you know, a benchmark. 
[01:45:30]  3,000 hits is guaranteed.  That's a benchmark.  That's a guarantee.  Plus, he wasn't an old, old guy.  He probably could have played four months.  Yeah, he would have.  How old was he?  About 35, maybe?  He was 38.  He was 38.  What was his?  38 was old back then for baseball players.  You're wrong.  His last hit was a mountain.  Hey, what was his average?  What was Clemente's average?  3.17.  3.17.  That's a Hall of Fame.  Of course.  3.17, 3,000 hits.  But people had to be different. 
[01:46:00]  They had to be dicks.  Well, back then, there might have been different motors, too.  What year was that?  Like, 1970?  78.  Oh, that late.  73.  Sorry, 73.  73.  Oh, shit.  I thought I knew the year.  I got excited.  I was off by five.  What, sir?  What?  There was one Tessel who didn't put anybody.  I think it was just one voter who put Cal Ripken in.  And he came out and said it.  And he was proud of it, he said.  Why?  And it was his right as a baseball writer to be the one who stood up and kept the tradition  going of not putting someone in 100% on their person. 
[01:46:30]  But what tradition?  It's such a dumb tradition.  It's like, it's such a fraudulence.  Hey, I'm a different guy.  I'm a different guy.  What's that?  You're such a self-righteous asshole.  I hate those sports.  Sam, can we Google the guy who didn't put him in?  Mr. Different guy who wants attention for himself.  Exactly.  Push it out, boy.  Good call there, Todd.  Good call. 
[01:47:00]  All right.  Yeah, Babe Ruth got 95% of the vote.  He wasn't an idiot on the phone.  He was good.  Spoke in a clear, concise fashion.  That was a good fucking phone call right there.  He didn't step on everybody.  Holy shit, was that good.  We should cut our losses right there.  One call today.  That's it.  Yeah.  Cal Ripken, not Babe Ruth.  What are we doing?  Sam's just butchering the internet.  Sam is horrid when it comes to the internet.  He's a terrible Googler.  But he makes believe he doesn't hear you. 
[01:47:30]  No, because if I stop and I start talking to you, then you go, well, why didn't you find  the Cal Ripken?  Is that what they sound like?  Whose voice is that?  I'm not going to tell you.  You guys talk amongst yourselves and figure it out.  Is that a combination of all three?  Why do you save him, Travis?  Where is it?  That's right.  No, Travis.  I want to know what voice he was doing.  No, all three combined in one.  I heard a little of myself in there.  Were you mocking me?  I wouldn't do it.  Not individually.  Sam, would you admit that you suck when it comes to the internet?  The Google.  On radio.  No, not the second thing. 
[01:48:00]  And he slid in there.  An earmark.  Well, that was a pork belly.  Yeah.  A pork belly, yeah.  It's an earmark or a pork belly.  I don't know.  Whatever.  What happened?  What happens with the internet?  You are bad at it, right?  You admit.  You can't be good at everything.  Or something.  I heard him say it again.  He won't say it because Jim keeps slipping in head radio.  Come on, Jim.  An idiot.  You almost have him admitting it.  Stop.  Stop already.  I apologize.  So you suck at the internet, right? 
[01:48:30]  On radio, yeah.  Grown men.  Room full of grown men.  You think?  What the fuck is going on here?  Well, you do.  You want to see?  No, we'll talk about that next, actually.  Oh.  A little something I just saw.  I got to fucking piss with my simulator.  Oh.  Let's go make wee-wees.  And we're going to do heat wave warning next.  And we might intro some records as well. 
[01:49:00]  Oh.  Oh.  When are we doing that?  We're not.  Just said that.  Uncle Kevi sounds just like the heat wave warning guy.  Really?  Yeah.  When is Uncle Kevi bringing his air check in?  Because he said he was nervous around us.  Did Uncle Kevi bring it in?  Is he in today?  No.  He comes back Thursday.  Oh.  Oh.  Make sure he gets that air check and make sure we cut it up nice for him.  Uncle Kevi.  We got a heat wave warning guy. 
[01:49:30]  It's not hot anymore, right?  Nah, cold buff.  That's fucking cold this morning.  Well, it's hot down south. 
[01:50:00]  So the fuel down south.  Yeah.  Down in the Gulf states.  It's a little warm down there.  And then they got that hurricane-y thing happening.  Which one?  Debbie?  Debbie.  Hurricane Debbie.  Isn't this great?  Is that still happening?  I think so.  Yeah.  Still spinning down there doing something.  Meow.  Think New York will ever get hit with one of those?  Like a real one.  Like you see it coming.  Like, oh, fuck.  Every so often.  Every so often it happens.  It's got to be perfect conditions to get a really bad one. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  The water just cools off too much up here.  I guess the one last summer was pretty bad, so I shouldn't downplay that.  Was it a good one?  Yeah.  We were mad.  But it turned out it did some damage on the Jersey Shore.  But they were talking about how New York City was going to get.  Oh, the doom and gloom about New York City.  Like Manhattan was going to be partly destroyed by this thing.  That's what annoyed me, but it did turn out to do some horrendous damage for people.  Most of the damage done during a hurricane is flood and tree damage and what the trees 
[01:51:00]  do to wires and everything like that.  It's not going to happen in Manhattan.  You just don't get it.  Nothing's going to fucking really flood.  And there's no trees to fall on anything.  So they always talk doom and gloom or gloom and doom.  There's no poles in Manhattan.  It's really strange.  How do they do that electricity shit?  Without poles.  There's holes in the ground.  I know, but why can't they do it everywhere at this point?  I know. 
[01:51:30]  I still got wires.  Enough, all righty.  On my fence line, I got wires.  Why?  You don't need to do that anymore.  No.  Here's a guy doing a heat-waving thing.  We got a severe heat-wave warning for Dan.  Oh, it's the same guy.  Same guy.  Oh, he's going for another hit.  Oh, yeah.  B-side.  This is Hurricane Warning Guy doing heat-wave warning.  He does tons of them.  No, he doesn't.  He does all the weather reports.  No, he doesn't.  I disagree.  This is the second one I've heard.  You should listen.  Nope.  He does lots of them.  Call me maybe. 
[01:52:00]  We got a severe heat-wave warning for Dan for Colorado next week from June the 24th  until June 30th.  The heat-wave will be very powerful.  It's supposed to be a real hot weather with 30-plus degrees Celsius.  Keep on Dan for being prepared for heat-wave.  What happened to the voice?  He ran out of the fucking air.  Be prepared for heat-wave.  He ran out of the air. 
[01:52:30]  What happened there?  With his dumb character.  Why are we listening to this?  Is he retarded or is it a bit?  I don't know.  Let's take a look, Adam.  You usually can tell.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Oh, that's him.  Oh, he looks a little.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he's retarded.  The wave will be real powerful.  People never have lots of water.  Drink lots of cold water.  When you drink any other drinks, like juice or water or pop, you'll get thirsty right away. 
[01:53:00]  Drink lots of water.  Stay indoors.  If it's an air conditioner, stay inside.  Because the heat wave will be very strong.  Ugh.  Shut up.  And high heat for Dan for Colorado next week.  People in Dan for...  Hey, did we get the Anderson Silva audio for today? 
[01:53:30]  Exactly.  I would love it if there's audio existing.  Holy fuck, man.  He said he's going to break...  Chael's legs.  Chael's face.  Knock his teeth out.  At UFC 148.  We got any of that audio.  It was on a conference call, so I don't know if there is audio of it.  If there is, it might just be cheap, but he didn't do it at a traditional press conference.  Right.  It was on a...  This is the real deal, too.  I mean, these guys like to pump some shit up, but these guys really don't like each other.  He hates...  When is this?  This is the one you guys are going to? 
[01:54:00]  Yes.  Fuck!  July 7th.  So that's what?  Two weeks?  Week and a half at this point?  Something like that?  Week from Saturday, I guess.  Week from Saturday?  What did he say?  I'm going to...  He said he's going to break his face.  He never talks like this.  He never talks like this.  Is he angry at the man?  Yeah, but he's...  They got some beef, Ant.  Oh, they got some beef?  They got some beef.  He's normally calm.  He said, right now, I'm focused on what's going to happen in the next few weeks, and right  now, play time is over.  I'm going to beat Chael's ass like it's never been beat before.  The joke is over. 
[01:54:30]  There's no more talking.  I know he's on the line listening.  The game's over.  I'm going to beat his ass out of the UFC.  He's never going to want to fight again after I'm done with him.  It doesn't matter if I'm on the bottom, the side, the top.  It doesn't matter.  Chael's son is going to get his ass kicked like he's never gotten his ass kicked before.  What I'm going to do inside the octagon is something that's going to change the image  of the sport.  I'm going to beat his ass like he's never been beaten before.  I'm going to make sure that every one of his teeth are broken.  His arms are broke.  His legs are broke.  He's not going to be able to walk out of the octagon by himself. 
[01:55:00]  I can guarantee that.  And this guy, everybody talks a lot of crap, but this guy never, ever talks that way.  And I think as he goes lower, he says, uh, uh, I'm just going to make him pay and make  him eat everything that he said, not only about myself, but about our country, about  everything.  I'm going to make him pay and make sure that he never disrespects any Brazilian, any fighter.  I'm going to beat him.  I'm going to beat him maybe the way his parents should have beat him to teach him some manners  because he's disrespectful. 
[01:55:30]  He's a criminal.  And I'm going to beat him up like he's never been beat before.  Mike work.  He, but he, but Silva's not, he's not though.  This is real.  Silva's not that guy.  We interviewed him.  You saw how he was.  He's a meek, quiet hook.  Yeah.  He's not working.  I mean, he's working the mic, but this is real.  He really genuinely is just exploding.  He's tired of this guy.  He hates.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The game's over.  I'm not playing anymore.  Um, yes, he really, man, he's going to have to see a plastic surgeon after the fight.  Wow. 
[01:56:00]  Is Dana white man that he took it this far?  No, no.  Dana loves it.  He's so angry of it that this gentleman, what did he do to him?  I don't understand.  Chael had to, Chael was on the line when this happened, but I mean, he probably loves it.  Did Chael say anything back?  I don't know, but he probably loves the co-promotion because this really hypes up the fight.  But there's also a point where he said things about Silva that, like, Silva really wants  to hurt him.  Like, and Silva never, he's not, he's, you know.  You think that's going to fuck up his head a little bit going into the fight? 
[01:56:30]  It'll probably make him much more focused.  You think?  The last time he did, he had a grudge like this, he beat up Damian Maia, really humiliated  him.  But I think he wants to hurt Chael badly.  God, I wish he was on this.  Apparently so, huh?  I wish.  Yeah, this was going to be, this is going to be a good one.  Who else is on that card?  It was supposed to be Uriah Faber.  Oh, that's right.  He got switched.  What, Sam?  Um, White ended the teleconference less than 30 minutes after it began when Sonnen suddenly  disconnected from the call. 
[01:57:00]  Before his exit, the one-time middleweight challenger called Silva an amateur and referenced the well-known  Barb, one of many delivered before and since the first fight that stroked Silva's rage.  Tell him I've got two words for him.  Medium rare, Sonnen said, a quip referencing an interview in which he said he wanted Silva's  wife to make a mistake.  Oh.  Hey, woman.  Hey, woman.  Why don't you bring your pretty little self to my apartment?  I'll show you a real man.  Medium rare. 
[01:57:30]  Chael is a fucking...  Hey, my boy.  Mmm.  Whoa.  Silva has a lot on the line, but that could work against him, because if Chael wins the  first round and does the same thing over again, like gets him on the ground...  They fought before.  And Chael beat the shit out of Silva for five rounds.  Oh, he did.  So if Silva wins this one, then we're looking at a third fight.  No, no.  Silva won the first one.  Okay.  So if...  If Chael wins this one, they'll be a rebound.  Okay.  Then there'll be a third fight. 
[01:58:00]  But...  Wait.  What happened was, in the first round, it was five rounds.  Yeah, I never saw this fight, so you gotta help me out.  He beat up Anderson Silva for five rounds.  He had him on the ground the entire fight, and he beat the shit out of Silva.  It was an absolute destruction.  Like, Silva got beat up.  And with, like, two minutes left in round five, fucking Silva tapped him.  Oh, man.  It was one of the greatest wins ever in UFC.  I hadn't...  We're fighting.  I still haven't seen the fight.  And Anderson said that he had a broken... 
[01:58:30]  Like, a broken, uh...  They might even have it here.  The, uh...  He was just getting...  Just trying to fight.  He was getting beat up so fucking bad.  And, uh...  And Chael said after, it was a devastating loss.  Right.  It was fucking devastating to lose that fight.  Damn.  Because, uh...  He had it won.  He had the championship won.  Wow.  That's crazy.  But...  We could hear everything.  What did you just say to the mic? 
[01:59:00]  We heard everything.  And I'm making Sam sneeze.  Thank you.  What did Kenny say to you?  The audio is on...  Whisper it like you whispered it to me.  Yeah, you're the worst whisperer ever.  Is the audio online?  The audio is on the UFC website.  Oh.  But somebody should pull it because he's speaking in his native tongue first.  And then somebody translates it when he's done talking.  Oh, okay.  Wait.  So we got audio of the press conference?  No.  It's on the UFC website. 
[01:59:30]  I guess it was recorded.  That's what I mean.  Yeah.  But he talks in his native language?  Yeah.  That's not good.  I still want to hear him say it, though.  But then once he's done talking, somebody translates it.  Yeah, but who cares?  What's his native language?  Probably Portuguese.  Oh.  Portuguese.  I'm curious as to how he sounds when he's talking.  Because he probably...  Let's see if he sounds angry.  You probably can't tell...  No, no, no, I don't know.  No, no, no, no.  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, let's find this shit.  Let's play it.  Let's go.  Dude, the end of that fucking first fight. 
[02:00:00]  It's one of the greatest wins I've ever seen in sports.  I've heard about it over the years.  I've got to actually watch it.  I've got to watch it.  Wow, did he beat him.  I mean, Rogan was saying it.  He said Anderson Silva's been hit more in this fight than in his entire UFC career.  Wow, man.  I'll send you the link.  Who's in the next fight?  Forrest and Tito?  Oh, boy.  Kenny said it was on that site.  It's not on that site.  Well...  It is.  He just can't find it.  He can't find it.  Oh, Sam, he's blaming you.  I didn't even look yet.  I just didn't notice it.  Oh, Sam.  Sam, are you going to take that over, Kenny?  He's the best internet finder guy ever. 
[02:00:30]  That's what I'd say.  Sam and I are traveling to Vegas to get like a couple with Bob Kelly.  Ah!  That sounds fun.  Well, a couple who sits on two different ends of the plane.  Oh!  Well, for weights, Sam and I have to sit on one end.  Yeah.  Well, we're all sitting together, aren't we?  First class?  I wouldn't think I'd be sitting in first class.  Oh, you poor fucker.  That's terrible.  No, I don't sit in first class. 
[02:01:00]  I sit in coach.  That's all right.  We'll see you after.  Oh, good.  We'll come back and talk to you while the flight's happening.  I always say that to people that are back there.  I never get out of my seat.  Never.  It's like, yeah, no, I'll pop back.  When I used to open for dice and Kenny and Happy would be in first class, I'd be in coach.  They would come back and just annoy me and wake me up.  Of course they would.  Well, they should.  They'd be sitting in bulkhead of sleep.  They'd just come back and pester me.  Oh, yeah, to pester, that's good.  But as far as coming back to chat, why am I leaving the paradise that is first class? 
[02:01:30]  I can't wait to get the various.  Yeah.  I wish I was going.  Sam, what are you doing?  I wasn't working in the Firefox browser.  Firefox stinks.  Enough with Firefox.  Why are you doing Firefox sucks, dude?  Everyone thinks they're fucking, no, it's better than this and that shit.  It's not.  It's awful.  Is this it?  It blows.  It's so buggy.  Now it's even more personal.  Oh, boy.  A lot of people are going to be buying this one.  I don't believe this is hype either.  I really think that Anderson Silva wants to fucking murder him. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  I use Netscape browser.  What's happening?  It's not loading.  Whoa.  Come on.  Are you still in Firefox?  It loaded for Kenny.  Oh, don't yell at me.  Commercial.  Oh, that doesn't sound so upsetting.  Yeah, it seems like they're having a nice music.  With a limited nationwide end.  Oh, let's have a fun.  Hipster hat on.  Big guy.  Ugh.  They're obsessed with the hipster hat.  I hate them.  I hate them, too.  God.  Hipsters.  It's Sunday, Wednesday, Monday. 
[02:02:30]  It's Sunday, Wednesday, Monday.  I swear to you. 
[02:03:00]  Is he speaking English?  I don't know what language is.  It's a wacky Portuguese.  It almost sounds like it's a wacky language.  Does he know no one knows what he's saying?  Yes.  He's going to be able to walk out there by himself. 
[02:03:30]  It doesn't matter if I'm on the bottom, the side, the top.  It doesn't matter.  Chael Shonen is going to get his ass kicked like he's never gotten his ass kicked before.  What I'm going to do inside the octagon is something that's going to change the image  of the sport.  I'm going to beat his ass like he's never been beaten before.  I'm going to make sure that every one of his teeth are broken, his arms are broken, his  legs are broken.  He's going to not be able to walk out of the octagon by himself.  I can guarantee that.  And I know that he's listening. 
[02:04:00]  So the game's over.  No more shit talking.  It's on now.  Wow.  Well, you can't get all that done because he's going to stop the fight.  Yeah.  He might be able to break one bone, so you better pick a good one.  Dude, the end of that fight is so good.  That fucking fight is so exciting, that first one.  God damn.  Craziness right there.  They're fucking out.  I'm really hyped about this fight.  Out for blood.  Yeah.  I hope something doesn't go wrong. 
[02:04:30]  Like our plane's delayed for two days.  We're crashing.  Well, like Sam and I are making love and we lose track of time.  Oh, no.  It's happened before.  Tee hee.  Oh, boy.  You think Eugene Levy likes his eyebrows?  He loves them.  Oh, my God.  He's dyeing them now.  What is he using to his eyebrows?  It's sort of my trademark.  Meh.  His Groucho Marx kind of glasses.  He didn't have...  His eyebrows weren't dyed when he came in here.  They weren't?  I don't know.  I didn't pay attention. 
[02:05:00]  Look how obvious it is.  Yeah, they're really dark.  Oh, I'm going to use my eyebrows to make some expressions now.  He's in the new Tyler Perry movie.  Is that what he's promoting?  Madea Witness Protection.  So why isn't he coming in to promote that movie?  Which will do much better than the American Pie movie.  I don't know.  Why do we only get these guys for the shitty movies?  Madea.  Oh, as opposed to the Madea movie?  Madea movies do, Sam.  They do very well.  Thank you.  But they're shitty movies and they only do well because...  How do you know? 
[02:05:30]  Have you ever watched one?  Yeah, I did.  Yeah, I watched that Madea goes to jail.  Was it good?  No.  What was wrong with it?  Yeah, it was fucking horrible jokes.  Yeah.  They're like hacky, fucking fat black woman, but it's really a guy joke.  You mean sassy?  Yeah.  They don't like...  Yeah, a lot of sass going on there.  A lot of sass?  Madea.  Madea.  I've never seen a Madea movie.  Oh, man.  Oh, they're good.  This fucking computer stinks.  Well, we've been saying it for years.  Typing into it does, too.  No, but this is... 
[02:06:00]  I see what we do to make this computer better.  I mean, the videos are removed, too.  I don't know.  Oh, okay, okay.  They're all saying the videos are removed.  Yeah, they don't want that just out there if it was that good.  God, I want to see that.  Oh, yeah, this was the question.  Jenny McCarthy, she's going to be in Playboy again.  Oh, yeah?  39-year-old single mom's cover shot for the popular men's magazine is her sixth.  Oh, yeah?  She's been in Playboy since 1993.  Can we see what that looks like, Sam?  Mm-hmm. 
[02:06:30]  What's going on?  CNN is due on those...  Madea witness protection trailer.  That was great.  She looks all right.  Yeah, here's that.  39, she looks fucking...  Yeah, there it is.  Tremendous.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'd smooch her butthole.  Would you?  A lot of airbrushing, though.  A lot of airbrushing.  Hmm.  She's hot, man.  Yeah, she's all right.  She looks good.  Yeah.  She is fucking hot.  I'll give it to her.  She looks pretty goddamn good.  Her comedy's goofy, though.  I wouldn't care if she never told...  Her humor's goofy.  Her pussy's up in the air. 
[02:07:00]  I don't care what comes out of her mouth.  Goofy.  Look at her fucking juicy rump.  That is pretty juicy.  Juicy.  She's phenomenal, dude.  Why isn't she showing the pink?  Oh, boy.  Does the world hurt there?  I don't think you're counting the cover.  Yeah.  No, not the cover.  No, I know.  Not a playboy.  Ooh.  No other pics?  No, yeah.  Let me see a naked picture of her from episodes past.  Back in the day?  Yeah.  What's going on?  Nude.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It looks fake, anyway.  All right.  Go with that.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Come on.  It doesn't load.  What are you saying?  I clicked it already.  Because it's you.  Why not?  You're an internet mush.  You're a fuck of turkey.  You're the cooler.  You're the internet cooler.  I wanted to see that.  I want to see.  Yeah.  Come on.  Come on.  All right.  Wow.  We.  Ah, now we're talking.  Yeah. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  That's pretty good right there.  Oh, man.  You just got to stare and do the up and down, like.  Yeah.  What part were you looking at first?  I was looking at her legs and thighs, like, like, right where the, they meet the, the torso  to make an ass of themselves.  Yeah.  And that.  All right.  Give us another one.  Give us another one.  Shit.  Fucking.  Yeah.  Just suck them, right?  Suck them both.  Like that fucking guy, like the guy in Pulp Fiction that ran the porn store. 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Come on.  Get.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Come on.  I love the fact that Jim Carrey was fucking hitting that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He certainly was.  Wow.  She likes growing some beaver in, huh?  Yeah.  See that beaver pelt?  I don't mind a girl that isn't afraid of a little bit of, uh.  That's fake.  Wow.  All right.  That's perfect.  That's fake.  It's fake.  How do you know?  Look at the face.  It doesn't match the body.  Oh. 
[02:09:00]  Sam's right.  Good job, Sam.  What?  Sam's an ass.  Good job.  I don't know, uh.  All right, so she'll be in Playboy again when?  I like a girl that's not afraid of a little fuzz.  This month.  Coming out soon.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Hmm.  Wow.  Oh, this is real.  Yeah, Peck is all over her.  Jesus. 
[02:09:30]  That's where the dicks go to hang out.  That's where the dicks go to hang out right in front of her face, apparently.  I guess everybody was saying that Sarah Silverman clip we watched, she had gained weight for  that part.  Oh, did she?  Because we were saying she looked a little rotund and a little hefty around the bottom.  What?  Her nude thing.  That naked video.  Were you here that day?  Maybe you weren't in.  I don't think I was here that day.  She's nude?  Yeah, she did a movie.  She's completely naked. 
[02:10:00]  Really?  Yeah.  Why would she do that?  I don't know.  She's like full frontal.  Really?  Pubis.  A lot of hair.  Michelle Williams is in it, too.  Totally naked.  Look at that Sarah Silverman.  That's rough.  Naked.  That's rough.  That isn't even the roughest looking one.  Really?  Show me the one.  There's some that are pretty...  Yeah, look.  Dude.  Look, even if she gained weight, there's something going on with the hips and the top of the thighs 
[02:10:30]  that makes it look like her pelvis is square.  And her boobs are too separated.  Yeah, there's a lot of separation there and a little elongation going on.  She's got a weird body.  She's got a weird body.  You're right.  Even if she gained a little weight, you would still see the shape of it.  Yes.  The shape is weird.  She's got weird proportions in those hips.  And did she grow in the hair for the part?  I don't know.  Why would she go full frontal for the movie?  Well, Michelle Williams had hair, too. 
[02:11:00]  I don't know.  I don't know what the movie's about or anything.  I just know that they're naked in the shower.  Where's Michelle Williams?  Yeah, show the picture with all of them.  It's actually a video.  You know, you can watch a video, but...  I like Michelle Williams.  Sam's trying to find a video.  Although I don't like her with the really short hair.  That's Michelle Williams on the left?  On the left, yeah.  Oh, God.  What's the matter?  I don't know, man.  She's a little heftier than normal, but she looks good.  Her hands are behind her head, so it's tough to tell, but...  She don't look bad.  Who's the pig in the middle?  That's a giant woman in the middle, yeah.  Yeah, it's Andre. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Andre the Giant.  What are they doing all naked and stuff?  They're yapping about boyfriends.  Really?  Yeah, it's some chick thing.  All right.  Get to that.  We should reenact that.  Yeah.  Whoa.  What happened?  What?  What?  Did I...  What?  What happened there?  I didn't mean to say it.  Whoa.  Can we take a break?  Yes.  I want to plug...  Let's do that.  What do you got, Jimmy?  You want to plug my ass?  I'll build it with my fist.  My special this Saturday night airs 9 o'clock on Epix and epixhd.com. 
[02:12:00]  And you can go to epixhd.com and get a free trial.  It doesn't cost you anything.  You can watch it online if you want.  A trial?  I don't want to go to jail here.  No, it's not that type of trial.  It's a T-R-Y-E-L.  Oh.  It's a special trial.  It's scary.  I thought I was going to be the next Mr. Sandusky or something.  Oh, no.  You're not going to jail for anything except for that hat and those shoes not matching each  other.  Darling, you always give me grief about my accessories. 
[02:12:30]  So, yeah.  This Saturday night, 9 o'clock.  It's going to be on DirecTV next month, too.  They're finally going to DirecTV.  That's awesome.  And Ozzy and Sharon retweeted me.  Or actually tweeted for me yesterday.  Well, that's nice of them.  Very big day for your pal.  Yes.  They sent out my clip.  Very good.  Oh, is it 10 p.m.?  Oh.  Oops.  I've been saying 9 o'clock.  Ah, they can sit there and wait.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll continue.  The Operatory Channel.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:13:00]  On SiriusXN.  Bobo Man to O&A  Bobo Man to O&A  Let me on the show.  Just let me right back on. 
[02:13:30]  10.  Bobo Man to O&A  O&A.  He rocks.  He rocks.  Why the fuck would you play that?  I was told that you wanted a long break, not something we normally play.  I've heard this plenty of times.  Yeah, that's exactly what we said.  But that thing stinks.  This is so painful.  It was funny for one day, maybe.  Painful.  This was a request.  And I fulfilled the request.  A request by who?  The guy right across from you.  Sam?  Oh, Sam.  I wanted to see if he would play it. 
[02:14:00]  No.  Oh, this is terrible.  Come on.  Bobo Man to O&A  But he said he wants to get him to play it when I left.  This is horrible.  There's nothing good about this.  It was sort of okay for maybe a day or two.  Sort of.  I cut this shit off.  No one even knows who Bobo is at this point.  No.  Listen to what they're playing.  This is O&A to Bobo Man. 
[02:14:30]  We think you're really great.  Why would you play this?  Turn this on.  It stinks.  I was told a long break and something that we don't normally play.  So this is sort of the same old filler.  We never play this.  We have eight years of material.  Let's find some other shit.  C-SPAN.  Why don't you just pipe in C-SPAN?  It's a long break and something we never play.  Wow.  I'm glad that's done with.  Any other choices? 
[02:15:00]  Thanks.  Thanks for a long break.  The best of Dustin Diamond.  Maybe you could put that on.  How about Balloon Animal Guy?  Balloon Animal Guy?  Favorite bit ever.  That was a good one.  Sure was.  I liked Steve the Whistler, too.  It was great.  That was a good one.  That's the number one for me.  Of all.  So uncomfortable.  And what makes me howl, because I got a kid, so I've seen the Muppet movie a million  fucking times.  I have to say it again, and I apologize.  Huge whistling scene to end the movie, and I'm like, holy fuck, Steve the Whistler finally 
[02:15:30]  got a big fucking part.  Did he get the gig?  No.  That wasn't him.  Anyone can do that.  There was a better whistler.  Anyone can do that.  Stop.  I mean, a massive whistling scene in this Muppets movie.  It's Walter, the new puppet, and it's the grand finale of the movie.  Yeah.  So I'm like, motherfucker, Steve the Whistler finally making it.  Nope.  I waited.  I sat for the credits to see if his name popped up.  Yeah.  It wasn't him. 
[02:16:00]  Man, I can't believe...  How do you lose that gig?  There's probably only two of you.  I can't believe E-Rock ripped us off of a break.  I know.  Now we're all fucked out of a fucking break.  We're not going to lie to you.  We all sat around and said, you know what?  Give us a little longer break.  Let's chill a little bit.  I could have kicked my feet up a little longer.  I said, all right, with that, let's get something we haven't heard in a while.  And you play that whole shit.  Bullshit, man.  It's terrible.  I blocked him, by the way.  Yeah, I did too.  And I blocked every version of him.  And I blocked a lot of people that are retweeting him. 
[02:16:30]  Done.  I'm done with it.  If you get a retweet, you get a bull.  I'm done with it.  Because it's just nonsense.  And now he'll cry and be bummed out.  You know, eventually, I guess I'll follow one of your accounts again.  But just fucking chill out.  Yeah.  Please.  Just endless fucking nonsense.  And I've told him already.  And he just won't stop.  So, again, you have ears.  We've all told him.  I know you're a little slow. 
[02:17:00]  Enough with the slow.  Are you that slow?  I just...  Shut up.  You fucking said don't do that.  I won't block you.  Okay.  Dumb.  Shut up.  Come on, Bobo.  Thursday is pest day at the Brooklyn Cyclones game.  Organized by Bobo.  Oh, no.  Oh, wow.  What?  How many people have signed up?  So far, just the Bobo man is going to be there.  Nah, he's got his people, too.  But he has posted messages on Twitter and Facebook requesting that people come up and say hi to him. 
[02:17:30]  Hey, Open Anthony fans.  The guy from the Brooklyn Cyclones game, known as King Henry, talked to me.  He is a big fan of XM 105.  Okay.  And told him it would be neat if I could get a bunch of pests.  Join me at the game.  Send me money so we get a group raid.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:18:00]  Let's send money to Bobo so he can organize a group raid.  He's organizing the whole thing.  What horrible event is this?  It's the pest day at the Brooklyn Cyclones game organized by Bobo.  When's he doing that?  Thursday, I guess.  628?  He's going to organize it in just a week.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  I'd hate to go to that.  The day after tomorrow.  Yeah, the day after tomorrow.  Do you think it's going to be a hit?  I think so.  I mean, it seems like he's got the group raid.  I guess a bunch of people must have...  He's got all the marketing in place.  Yeah, people must have sent him money. 
[02:18:30]  It's viral marketing, which works with the kids.  All right.  Bless you, Jimmy.  Bless you.  Jesus.  I love the fact that Christy Brinkley and her husband just hate each other so much, they  had to get a fucking...  Yeah, they got it...  A go-between?  They have to have somebody...  Yeah, like referee them so they could even see their kids.  See their kids properly? 
[02:19:00]  There's the hatred.  Yeah, that doesn't fuck up your kids' lives.  Man.  God.  But I guess...  Yeah, I guess that ended poorly.  What was the big problem?  He might have been fucking for a young girl.  He was fucking around and she didn't like it.  I believe that was it, right?  Yeah, I mean, here's what she says.  I moved on from my marriage the moment a police officer informed me that my husband  had been cheating on me in a two-year affair with his 17-year-old daughter, meaning the 
[02:19:30]  cop's daughter.  Oh, my God.  So the cop told her...  He's been fucking my daughter.  Wow.  And he says...  And she also says, I've navigated the court system to find peace and protection for my  family from the various forms of abuse at the hands of a narcissist.  He says, Christy may never understand or come to regret the bitterness she has left  in people's hearts, including our children's, but as we are all aware, no money, no religion, 
[02:20:00]  no church, no eulogy, no media attention or magazine article, no matter how elaborate,  can remove the legacy of a mean spirit.  See, he's just...  He fucked up, even though she may have been cunty, but what he did publicly humiliated  her by fucking a 17-year-old.  Ouch.  She's out for blood now, and it's like, you gotta understand, you got caught publicly cheating  with a 17-year-old on your model wife.  She's gonna be out for blood.  Well, this guy's despicable. 
[02:20:30]  Well, I wouldn't say that.  What?  You missed what he was doing there.  He's a terrible person.  Well, I don't...  You might just change the name of that story, I think.  I just don't understand how anybody could do that.  No, it's terrible.  You could change the name there.  The guy's an awful human being.  Cousin underscore Dave got all the Jenny McCarthy Playboy pictures, Sam, on Twitter.  You gave us one picture.  You gave us shit!  You gave us one picture, and Cousin underscore Dave gets the big Twitter plug today. 
[02:21:00]  All right, let's play Bobo Man for a second while I'm finding him.  Oh, God.  Bobo Man!  Horrible.  There you go.  These are the ones I showed you already.  Nope.  These are the new ones.  You actually just looked at this picture.  Nope.  These are the new ones.  I don't remember that one.  We didn't see that one.  By the way, you just...  I had to comment on the poodle.  Yep.  We didn't see that one.  You specifically looked at this one.  I did not see the poodle.  Sorry.  Didn't see the poodle.  Liar, liar.  I didn't see her upside down.  We didn't see her upside down.  This one you looked at.  Nope.  Yeah, I saw that one. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  Was that from the new one?  I'll agree with that.  Is this the new...  What the hell's that?  These are the new pictures.  See?  Oh, man.  We didn't see that one.  Look what she's doing.  It's from the same...  Her legs are spread.  Dude, her shoulder blades.  She wants to push them together in the back to try to get a little more lift.  Her boobs are a little separated, too, huh?  Oh, man.  Juicy, though, man.  Imagine sucking on them and going, huh?  You gotta go, huh?  Oh, she's fucking...  That's right.  I'm doing this.  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  Huh?  My word. 
[02:22:00]  These are the photo shoots that I was just showing you before break.  No, well, we didn't see the...  We didn't see the poodle one.  We didn't see the one with the legs spread.  Or I didn't see the schnoodle.  We didn't see her in the pool.  You saw this one.  The schnoodle.  Did not see that one.  Mr. Balutigans, I've told you before, he's a schnoodle.  A schnoodle.  A schnoodle.  How does he say it?  Schnoodle.  He's a schnoodle.  A schnoodle.  Schnoodle.  Those Jessica Biel pictures, by the way.  Uh-huh.  Let me see her ass.  Wow.  Is she fucking fantastic, man. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah.  Look at that rump.  She's been this way for a long time.  I never paid attention to her.  Really?  Jessica Biel?  Are you kidding?  No.  Wasn't Jeter fucking her?  What are you, homo?  No.  Oh.  Wasn't Jeter fucking her?  Or Justin Timberlake?  Yes.  Timberlake is banging her.  He still is?  No.  Timberlake, you know.  What?  Oh.  Did he move on?  I don't think it's so...  There were rumors about engagement, but those have been unfounded.  She looked so good in that fucking...  Oh, my god.  What was that?  Blade, the third one? 
[02:23:00]  She was in Blade, the third one?  The third Blade.  Wasn't she really?  God.  Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake.  Yeah, that one, too.  She looked great.  Fucking easy on her.  She's wearing some kind of fucking skin-tight leather suit.  Shooting shit with a crossbow.  You know Mike Tyson was on the Today Show, and he was talking about changing his life.  Oh, yeah?  It's an old clip, but we never got to it.  Huh?  Changed his life to what?  He's now the fun-loving, I'm-in-movies guy.  Oh, he's Hollywood?  He went Hollywood?  Come around with the hangover guys.  Yeah, he went Hollywood. 
[02:23:30]  He's fun at roasts and stuff.  Yeah, he is.  He's a fun guy now.  But he talks to the people at the Today Show and said this.  I remember when I was younger, like in my early teens, I wanted to die.  I wanted to die.  I'm ready to F you, and I'm everybody in everybody's face, and now I'm going to win.  World star hip-hop!  Yeah!  I would get so scared when he gets all pumped up like that.  I'd just be like, oh my god.  I'd have a guy from a nature show with a trank dart gun in the wings, just in case he goes  a little nuts. 
[02:24:00]  You could just...  Pew!  Yeah.  Just for the record, going back to the Jenny McCarthy thing.  We're past that, Sam.  It was the last year.  It was not the new Playboy Pictures.  Oh, no.  As I said.  Nope.  Cousin underscore Dave would never lie to me.  He was wrong.  It says clearly March 2011.  Nope.  Oh, no.  So, there's your precious Twitter.  He would never lie.  He's not lying.  He's just wrong, as most people on Twitter are.  Nope.  Most of them are right.  They're right by me.  When I was young, I want to die.  I want to do this.  I'm still going crazy. 
[02:24:30]  Ah!  Ah!  He's going crazy!  He could have put it in that World Star Hip Hop video we played earlier.  Yeah.  This is what I'm saying, though.  Then he makes all that money.  You go back and maybe you spread it around a little bit.  I'm going to make it rain.  Look.  I got this.  Here we go.  Here we go.  I'm making it rain and storms.  You know that I learned through the 50 Cent interview with Oprah?  50 Cent bought Mike Tyson's old place.  And Mike Tyson's old place was a 50-room mansion.  Wow.  Wow. 
[02:25:00]  50 rooms.  And then 50 Cent there bought it for a while.  What do you do with 50 rooms?  Oh, you enjoy it.  Does it look like a hotel?  I'd have one room just for guitars.  From your band?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Everybody in everybody's face.  And now I'm a wimp.  And I'm trying to avoid arguments and stuff.  And let my wife get away with the stupidest stuff, you know?  Like rape.  I don't know.  Because you're vegan, too.  Oh, you're a vegan?  Yeah, yeah.  What changed you? 
[02:25:30]  Um, wow.  I need, um, whew.  I used to up the white flag.  I used to, there was too many, too many, too many prison cells, too many jails, too many  lawsuits, too many bankruptcies, too many women.  And that's why he's a vegan?  Too many venerians.  Who's he punching?  Too many everything.  I got tired.  I, um, I really got tired of, um...  He's just punching Matt Lauer as he talks.  Yeah, yeah.  You hear that sound?  That's why you don't hear Matt Lauer.  Is he just pummeling him?  That'd be great.  Just leaning over, punching him in the face.  I got tired.  Um, I really got tired of, um... 
[02:26:00]  You know, like, every time my prostitute girlfriend came back for a trip I had to sleep with her,  you know, so I used to be like, I'm gonna live a different life.  Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.  You're gonna live a different life, you know?  You've made a conscious choice.  You're not a champ.  You're not a champ.  You're not a champ.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I was a prostitute hunter.  I'm sorry.  Okay, okay.  Let me stop you there.  Holy shit.  The point is, you made a switch.  Why would you stop him there?  God, thank God.  Because she stinks.  That's why.  That's Aunt Curry.  That's the one leaving the show.  Let him go. 
[02:26:30]  I'm glad she's getting fired.  She stinks.  She's horrible.  You got gold there.  They're giving her 10 million to leave.  That's how badly they were out.  He says.  And they're repositioning her.  I'm a prostitute hunter.  And she's like, let me stop you there.  Why, you dumb hole?  Yeah, that's why you have him on the show.  Holy fuck.  What did you just say, Mike?  She's heading on dangerous ground now.  We can get letters.  You think that's what that was about?  Oh, yeah.  She's just fucking thinking about her dumb career.  She's a yutz.  A yutz.  Breaking news. 
[02:27:00]  Oh, come on.  What's up?  Hold on a minute.  Uh-oh.  Is it real?  Yeah, someone fix it.  50 cent injured in car accident.  No way.  Come on.  Yep.  Russell.  I don't follow him.  Somebody else did this.  Another tweet.  What are you talking?  This one's real.  Last one wasn't.  This one's real.  I see him.  Look, there he is.  I don't see shit.  There he is.  No way.  It's photoshopped.  No, it's not.  Hospitalized and released after a car accident.  Oh, see? 
[02:27:30]  Who gives the turkey?  That's bad.  He was rear-ended by a truck.  What happened?  Wow.  Truck rear-ended him.  His SUV flipped over?  Almost causing 50's SUV to flip over in the process.  Oh.  Yeah.  The driver of the Mack truck lost control on the LIE.  Man.  Wow.  Damn, that happens a lot. 
[02:28:00]  Those trucks are crazy.  That's because the LIE is so fucking dipped.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, man.  It's so grooved.  And you got a lot of dipsy doodles.  A lot of dipsy doodles.  Like, when you're changing lanes, you're like, vroom, you drop and raise again.  Yes.  That's a really...  That's because the shitty construction that's done is that they're purposely making it in a way  where they'll need to repave it in 10 years.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the mayor wants to worry about sodas.  Yeah.  Sugary drinks instead of the nightmare commute that people have to deal with every day.  Oh, it is a nightmare. 
[02:28:30]  They could easily fix that.  I want to thank Mohawk, M-O-H-A-Q, on Twitter for that breaking news.  We wouldn't have had it.  He's treated and released.  Man, he's bad.  But he's in the neck dang.  He must have been like, aw, shit.  He was taped down.  It's a shot up that many times and something happens in a car accident.  That would be a run.  It took nine bullets.  Nine?  The Oprah interview was great.  It really was.  It took nine bullets?  It took nine bullets.  Jesus Christ.  Nine fucking bullets.  He bought his first gun when he was, I want to say, 13. 
[02:29:00]  How did he do that?  Did he...  He went through all the proper paperwork.  The background checks and stuff?  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  Yeah.  Oprah really is in the middle of nowhere.  No one talks about her.  No one.  No one talks about her network.  That would have been something everybody heard about, but it's on her dumb...  Why did she decide to do that?  Well, you asked me where it was.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know if it was an ABC special.  I don't know where it was.  I don't know if it was on her channel.  I have no idea.  It was.  It was on her channel.  It was on the Oprah network?  Yeah.  What a dummy she is.  Why would she leave to... 
[02:29:30]  Like, if you want to just retire, that's fine.  But she had that show going.  It was doing really well still.  Like, why would you leave to try to just do another show?  And doing a bunch of shit that's all girl stuff.  Nobody wants to see it.  I already have a lifetime.  First of all, she's not doing another show.  She hated the grind of that show.  Oh, yeah?  And she wanted to move on to other things.  And she believed at the time that she had enough shows to run a network.  Yeah.  It failed miserably right now.  Rose, Rosie failed.  Who's on own?  It's just a lot of garbage. 
[02:30:00]  This is why no one's watching.  There's a lot of, like, self-help type shows.  Like, you know, do-gooder shows.  But you've still got to kind of have a little tabloid in there.  She's got to look and just be like, this is hemorrhaging money.  You think she still walks into Elo's office and has a nice little chat every morning?  I bet Elo's a little nervous.  You think Elo's still petting her dog like he was in that reality show she was doing?  She's looking at him like, here's the motherfucker that ain't getting my shit done. 
[02:30:30]  I can't do that.  Elo's great.  Elo.  He is great.  I don't think they're blaming Elo.  Oh, they should.  I think they're going for a reinvention of the whole.  Yeah, what are they going to do?  I don't know.  The Rosie move is dumb because she just, she doesn't look likable now.  She doesn't look likable?  When she was, I'm just, I don't know.  Her nickname was the Queen of Nice.  Yeah.  And everyone knew she wasn't a nice person and then she decided to not be a nice person anymore  and you can't go backwards. 
[02:31:00]  She looked way too tough and hard on TV.  People don't like looking at that shit, I'm telling you.  Got to soften that.  Soften it up.  She came out very just, like, truck driver-ish.  Just tough.  Bull dyke.  And when she had massive ratings, she was called the Queen of Nice and she looked all put together  nice for her body type.  Made believe she wanted Tom Cruise.  She had her hair done nice and makeup and the right clothes.  And I saw a couple of these shows on Oprah.  She pretty much did it with sandals on.  She'd walk in with no makeup, just looking like, ugh, a little haggard. 
[02:31:30]  No audience, right, at one point?  Her hair freshly brushed by a vagina.  Of a vagina?  Of a vagina.  Of a vagina.  Of a vagina.  That's a hard word to say.  But Oprah should have, Oprah, you know, knowing entertainment, should have realized that.  She wasn't getting the Rosie O'Donnell that had the massive success.  No.  Have you seen an old Rosie clip, Sam?  Is there anything, like, I don't remember.  This is what you do.  Split screen, old Rosie with the latest Rosie.  It's unbelievable it's the same person. 
[02:32:00]  98?  I mean, good for her.  She's being herself finally, but that's not what got people watching her show.  That was like 15 years ago, that show.  But see, look, she's got makeup on.  She's got her hair done.  She's got, like, a nice shirt on.  She's like every woman watching her.  She's kind of dumpy and average-dressed and has no shot at these guys.  Now look at what she, uh, no, she didn't look anywhere near like that.  No, just find, like, a...  Sam, what are you doing? 
[02:32:30]  Sam wrecks everything.  Why don't you just put in Rosie no makeup?  Why don't you put in Rosie...  No, no, Ant.  In all fairness, I...  I was looking for what she looked like on the show.  Yeah, on the show.  Oh!  I saw her.  She didn't wear makeup on the show.  Get a clip, then.  Find a clip.  Google Rosie show own.  And then hit enter.  It's the same thing.  You bag of shite.  It's the same thing as a picture.  It's a picture of this video.  This is just ponderous.  Sam, you've got to admit, you're terrible at the internet. 
[02:33:00]  I just showed you a picture of the video I'm showing you now.  People were saying to me, oh, it wasn't fair.  It's not fair.  Yeah, she looks good.  She's okay.  So that's not...  Oprah gave me an amazing shot at doing this.  She really did.  She put me back on TV.  She believed in me.  I didn't even know if I could do it again, truthfully.  Oh, no.  See, that's after she left.  Yeah.  Look at the goofy background in the old Rosie show.  It looked fun.  Rosie O'Donnell show.  Oh, it's all goofy.  Can we hear the old show?  I want to hear what she...  I don't remember her back there.  She did a good show, man.  She was all incredibly over-the-top nice.  It's a CD entitled Being Myself. 
[02:33:30]  Please welcome the legendary...  The legendary...  Lena Horne.  The legendary Lena Horne.  The Rosie O'Donnell show.  I'm going to do voice-on.  With the stars.  I'm Connie.  Oh, my God.  See?  I'm going to die.  For the past 28 years, children and adults around the world have been listening to this  song.  It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.  Yay!  It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood.  Would you be mine?  Would you be mine? 
[02:34:00]  Sure.  It's a lovely day for a soap.  Bath, shower, fucking fight.  Would you be mine?  Sure.  Could you be mine?  I have always wanted to have a neighbor just like you.  I've always wanted to live in the neighborhood with you.  So let's make the most of this beautiful...  Oh, and he comes out.  Now he's live.  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  You know what kind of neighborhood he's talking about, right, Ant?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, huh?  Definitely.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Mr. Rogers, ladies and gentlemen, come on over.  He's dead.  Is he dead?  Oh, yeah.  It's nice to meet you.  I'm glad to meet you.  I met you a little while ago.  What a fire.  Oh.  He died in a poppers accident.  Did he go crazy when he saw you?  He liked the music.  Smells some poppers.  And he loved the music.  In fact, when we finished...  Oh, what a nice man. 
[02:35:00]  John McDaniel and everybody in the band went like that.  Yeah, fuck him.  Oh, yeah.  Dedicated his life to children.  He does that at home every time he comes off and starts to clap.  Bless his heart.  He loves it.  Bless his heart.  He's just a nice guy.  It's amyl nitrate here.  Ha, ha, ha.  Smell this, fatso.  I was walking on the beach and I found that.  And I thought, I want to give that to Rosie.  No, you didn't.  What a beautiful shell.  Thank you so much.  Give her a shell.  You asshole.  Have you ever washed up on something like this? 
[02:35:30]  Ha, ha, ha.  What do you think that shell is right now?  Put a little water on it.  I don't know.  It gets even more beautiful.  And I keep thinking that has something to do with life.  What?  That tears and sweat often bring out the best in us.  He lost his mind.  I think you're right, Mr. Rogers.  You know, the water dries, but I notice if you rub pre-cum on it, it stays glossy longer.  You see, this looks like the head of a gentleman's appendage. 
[02:36:00]  And when you lubricate the top and you sit on it, it really opens you up good, Rosie.  One man, one shell.  Watch this, Rosie.  Ha, ha, ha.  One man, one shell.  He cups the bottom of his scrotum with it and then pounds the other part up his asshole.  It's how he gets his balls.  Yeah, he mallets the other piece into his asshole until his balls are crammed in his ass.  And he tries to do it without breaking the shell. 
[02:36:30]  One man, one shell.  Fucking guy.  What is this?  Two girls on a horse?  Mr. Rogers.  You know, in all fairness, a guy is saying, Rosie, nice.  Look at her Tom Selleck interview.  You're absolutely right.  But that was not what she did, though.  That was toward the end, too.  That was very rare when she actually showed that she wasn't nice.  But that was the real Rosie that came out finally.  Blindsided him.  So you're right.  I mean, W. Adam C. 
[02:37:00]  You're right.  But that's not what she was doing day to day.  Oh, that's her with the where she's like a dominatrix kind of an outfit.  Part nine.  They got up to part nine.  No, it's just part nine of the video.  Part nine.  Wow.  They made nine exit to Eden movies, Anthony.  Really?  Nine movies.  I don't know that.  Wow.  Oh, God.  But they had to shove this down her throat and say, yeah, she's hot.  What a horrible getup that is.  Just because you put on a sexy outfit doesn't mean you're hot. 
[02:37:30]  And you see how she walked out of the room?  She was not brave enough to show that age.  She wasn't going to turn around.  Who's this?  Who's that?  I don't know.  What year is this?  2000?  No.  No, this was 79.  Mrs. Randy, citizenality is here for your pleasure.  What?  Who's that?  Is that Tyra Banks?  I guess I'm your fantasy.  I don't know. 
[02:38:00]  Who else is that?  Yeah, who's the black?  It's 1994.  Down on your knees.  Oh, that's that dumb model.  Yeah, Iman.  Yeah.  It's Maggie's a bully.  That's who it is.  Oh, sorry.  I love Bowie.  Iman.  I forgot.  Oh, sexy.  I would do that.  Would you?  Yeah.  You do what?  God, you're so boring.  Can't you do anything right?  She has her big thigh.  Her acting is terrific.  I can do something right.  She was in No Way Out.  She's great.  She's a terrible actress.  No, she's pretty good.  We're going to play a game.  Who's the guy? 
[02:38:30]  Equestrian game.  I don't know.  And the question game has only one question.  Hello?  Where is the camera?  Hello?  Hello?  Oh, Rosie's sexy.  It's the scene up.  Elliot Slater.  Annie, what are you doing with him?  Anything I like.  Do you mind?  As a matter of fact, I do.  You see, I have a 2.30 appointment with him.  Oh, no.  He's mine.  I get all dressed up in this outfit.  I spare me the details.  Get out of my room.  She's a flatso.  So funny.  Do you have confirmation?  No, she's not.  We went through this.  She went bra shopping.  She went bra shopping. 
[02:39:00]  She's got massive boobs.  I think they're just kind of...  Squishy?  A little saggy?  A little saggy.  Yeah, maybe.  We did this bit.  I know.  She ended up having D's.  Oh, look at her ass.  Oh, hi.  She left the room that.  Dumpy.  Flatso is such a funny word.  I know.  It's just hilarious.  That's one we made up years ago.  No one fucking said that one before us.  Flat.  Because, you know, when you get a fat broad, you at least get the big boobies, usually.  Yeah, not there.  Well, maybe. 
[02:39:30]  Well, maybe now.  Yeah, maybe.  Maybe she grew into it.  Maybe now.  Yeah, I think she did.  Flatso.  Oh, so we're talking about Oprah and 50 Cent and...  Yeah.  She also interviewed the Kardashians.  Yep.  How'd that go?  Well, I like that she acknowledged that, you know, she basically looked at the kids and  said, you do realize who your fucking father is, right?  Why do you treat him like shit?  I'm paraphrasing.  Oh, okay.  Because he was the greatest athlete in the world.  You realize that.  Wheaties box.  And they're like, yeah, you know, I guess. 
[02:40:00]  But we've done stuff with our lives, too.  No, your father, stepfather and father, whatever.  Yeah, that's the stepfather, yeah.  He was the greatest athlete in the world for a while and gets no respect.  Yeah, they respect the dead father that got a murderer off the hook.  Oprah and the entire Kardashian family.  Kim.  Would you be where you are had there not been a sex tape?  When people say that your last marriage was a stunt, how does that make you feel?  Chris.  Was there ever a moment where you ask yourself, am I pimping my kids? 
[02:40:30]  How much of it is real?  The exclusive.  You think it's famous for what?  The exclusive.  The exclusive.  What?  Oprah's next chapter, all new at a special time.  She is a great interviewer, though.  She doesn't fuck her out, man.  No, Oprah will ask anybody anything.  She doesn't fuck her out.  She doesn't have a point.  You don't think she has a publicist telling her what the fuck is...  Oh, she's a publicist, but not telling her.  No, I mean other publicists, I should have said.  Coming in the room and fucking snapping at her.  Kris Jenner doesn't want that question asked. 
[02:41:00]  I wonder what the publicist situation...  Like, I guarantee there were publicists that said, look, they don't want to talk about this,  and maybe Oprah would agree or disagree to avoid it, but I can't see her avoiding anything.  No, basically, I think these people go, look, man, she's going to ask tough questions,  but it's fucking Oprah Winfrey.  She's just so huge that she could say whatever she wants.  People are intimidated when they sit down in front of her.  She's not an interviewer looking at a big star going like, oh, my God, this is a big celebrity.  I don't know how long she's been doing this series on OWN, but this should be doing well.  I mean, if you're talking to 50 Cent and the Kardashians, it's got to be getting ratings, right? 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  The problem is you don't know where the fucking channel is.  Yeah.  I don't know where any channels are.  So I get lazy and I just do my basics.  There has to be a better way for the cable systems to do it where you can just look it up by the name.  There has to be a better way just to type in the name and do it.  You don't care enough about a lot of these shows to remember where the channels are.  You've got to put them in your favorites.  No, I understand you do that and there are people that do that, but I'm talking about mass appeal.  Yeah.  It's too complicated.  Or at least just go to the HD channels. 
[02:42:00]  If you just put the HD channels in, it skips through all that horse shit.  Right.  Fucking paid programming and all these other things.  That helps.  Yeah, it whittles it down a little bit.  It makes it easier to scan through.  I should have done her show when I could have.  I turned down doing her show.  What?  Oprah?  Yeah.  Stupid.  You laugh every time.  Yeah, you don't really commit.  Why don't you commit ever?  Because it's such a dumb lie.  There's no reason for me to type.  But you do it with all your lies.  You don't commit. 
[02:42:30]  I should have done it.  There's no reason for me to lie.  Jimmy turning down Oprah.  It's best when Jimmy says something and then stops talking and then looks around the room  with his eyes darting left to right.  That's another thing.  Right after your lie, you just stop talking.  Most people say something and they just continue talking.  You just stop and it's like, wait for the reaction.  Did they buy it?  Right.  Because I know I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to start laughing.  Your whole face says, did they buy it?  That's great.  I'll be honest.  I don't know what else to talk about today.  So can we go home early?  No. 
[02:43:00]  It's a slow news day.  So talk about yourself.  Yeah.  I don't feel like it.  I went to a birthday party yesterday.  How was that?  It was my niece's eighth, eighth, uh, party.  Eight years old.  Eight years old.  Big fucking, uh, cupcake cake thing.  Ice cream.  What'd you get her for a little gift?  Um, she's at that age.  All she wants is iTunes gift cards.  See?  At eight?  Isn't that amazing?  Yep.  Does she like Bieber?  No, I didn't ask her.  Hmm.  Yeah.  What's she going to use the cards for? 
[02:43:30]  Um, she says she's going to download a couple movies she wants to see.  Wow.  And my brother bought the Little House on the Prairie box set and the whole family's enjoying  and I'm like, what?  How?  Was that show good?  No.  No.  He says his daughters love it.  Well, I could see how.  They're eating, uh, what?  About six, I guess.  Yeah, I could see how they'd like it with little Laura Ingalls.  It gets a little out of hand and dark and gruesome.  That's what they are.  And, yeah, at first it was, you know, the little Ingalls children.  They're running down.  Look, there they are.  They're running down the little hill of grass. 
[02:44:00]  Nice.  Oh, the little one just fell.  Nice.  It's all fun.  And there's Pa Ingalls and Ma Ingalls on the wagon.  Yeah.  And they're smiling, having a great time.  And it was fun.  Then they made the older daughter go blind.  Oh, I forgot about that.  And then they had the son that they adopted and he winds up getting killed.  In what?  The Civil War or something?  I don't know what happened.  It got horrible.  And then the father's sneaking out to the barn because he doesn't understand why his asshole was so itchy.  And he's trying to scratch it with the business end of a rake. 
[02:44:30]  The horse brush.  Where's Pa?  Pa's out while scraping his asshole with the horse brush.  He's got a heck of an itch.  And then Laura got older and got married on the show.  And then it was Little House, A New Beginning.  Let the record show.  We're now talking about Little House on the Prairie because of Sam Roberts.  Sam.  As opposed to going home and talking about nothing?  Yeah.  That's way better.  No, it's not.  You know how bad that goddamn show got after a while? 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  Episode one.  They reached a point where they had to pull people in with action.  So they had a storyline, and I don't know why.  How do you know this?  I know everything about television.  They had a storyline where they wired up all the buildings to blow up.  The church, the mercantile, the fucking...  The sheriff saw everything.  They wired it up to explode and blew it up. 
[02:45:30]  I don't know why.  What year was the...  What year was Little House?  The first year was like probably 74?  Was it that old?  Oh, yeah.  It barely made it into the 80s.  I kind of remember.  I want to say 78 to like 85.  I think it was done by the early 80s.  It was really early on, I'm sure.  That's the blowing up stuff?  Yeah, destruction of Walnut Grove.  And they slow motion blew up Walnut Grove.  Was it a dream?  I don't know why.  No.  I think some guy was going to come in and take the town over. 
[02:46:00]  And so they blew it up?  So instead of having them...  Was this the end of the series?  Well, then they went on to something else where they moved.  But I don't know why they blew the town up.  Why do they need to dramatically put dynamite in?  And there goes the mercantile.  Oh, that's what's her name from 90210.  Who?  Oh, I remember that guy.  Sam Daugherty.  How bad is that?  They should have just moved.  Yeah.  Well, they did move, but they didn't want anyone else living there.  They had their memories.  They're all crying.  They're all crying looking at Walnut Grove being exploded. 
[02:46:30]  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  What years was this, Sam?  Find that before I cry.  It's slow motion.  Oh, they're going over the memories from Walnut Grove.  Yes, yes.  1974 to 1983.  Yeah, motherfucker!  74.  83.  What year did he die?  1992.  I would say 1990.  As Dice referred to as asshole cancer.  Hey, remember when asshole cancer would run?  He had a very funny bit on this show.  1991.  91. 
[02:47:00]  I said 92.  I was close.  What do I get?  I was under.  You went over.  Fuck!  Price is right, rules.  He did have a nice smile.  What about Nellie?  Nellie Olsen's still alive.  She's still alive.  Nellie was ugly, right?  She's doing comedy or something.  Is she?  Yeah, I think she did.  Oh, that broad wanted to come in and I was sick.  That broad.  Jody?  Fuck me, man.  She's cool, too.  Yeah, from...  She was on Julie McCullough.  Oh, yeah, I got you...  You know her?  How did I get that?  She, uh...  My Roger Paul called me.  Dude, one of these hot fucking broads is a fan of our show. 
[02:47:30]  Who?  And she was in town, but I was sick, and I didn't pass it along to you guys because I wasn't doing anything.  I knew that.  I just didn't think anybody wanted her.  I think she'd be cool on our show.  I sent that to Roland.  From Growing Pains.  From Growing Pains.  When I was growing up, I'd fucking want to have sex with her.  She was so hot.  Who was she?  You'll remember her, and she's now doing comedy, and she seems really cool.  She follows a bunch of us on Twitter.  How old is she?  Oh, man.  Remember her?  I certainly do.  She was a Playboy model.  She was on Growing Pains.  How old is she?  And then someone said, hey, you should go on Opie and Anthony, and she tweeted, I would love to. 
[02:48:00]  Are you kidding?  But I was sick.  How old?  47.  She's 47 now.  Wow.  Roger Paul called me one night and said, look, Julie McCullough wants to come on.  I don't know what a comedy's about.  I have no idea, but she seems like she'd be pretty cool.  That girl.  Remember her?  Certainly do.  She's a fan of our show.  Crazy.  Is she still in the New York area?  Does anyone know?  Do not know.  I just remember this right now.  Why don't you get a naked picture up if she was in Playboy?  What the fuck's wrong with you?  All right.  You're right.  Holy shit.  What?  Yeah, Sam.  Oh, my God. 
[02:48:30]  Go down.  Go down.  Three.  Over.  Over.  Oh, no.  The other way.  Right there.  With the big beaver again?  Yeah, let me see.  With the big muff.  That's not her.  What?  It's not her.  Yeah, that's not her.  Yeah.  That's fucking...  That's her.  Is that her?  Next time, trust my judgment.  Oh, man.  Hey, I'm not trusting your judgment on internet.  You're terrible at that and radio.  Oh, wow.  Back in the car.  With an old radio.  Yeah, stick it to her good.  She wants to come in.  Crazy.  Stick it to her good.  I apologize to her.  Someone reach out to her. 
[02:49:00]  I was sick.  Reach out.  We'd love to see what she's been up to.  She got kicked off growing pains because that asshole was too religious.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Douchey Kirk Cameron?  Yeah, that's the reason why she lost her TV gig in pretty much.  What a cock sign.  Her career was, you know, she did all right, but, I mean, that show was massive.  Because she did Playboy, right?  Yeah, man.  Cameron's an asshole.  Jerk off.  What a douche.  Really is a shit.  I really hate Kirk Cameron.  Can you find the actual story?  Because I don't want to misrepresent that, but I believe it had something to do with  Kirk Cameron and his religious beliefs.  He got her kicked off growing pains.  And she seems like she's so nice. 
[02:49:30]  I'd part that thing like a fucking Sherpa going through heavy brush.  Yeah.  And then just...  Is that what she did?  And then you got to sit there and go...  Yeah.  Have her call the show.  Is she up right now?  Let's just talk to her right now.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  Son of a bitch.  You like her aunt?  Yeah.  I like a hairy pussy.  I got a fucking...  I'm plumping up. 
[02:50:00]  Are you?  With her?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  She...  I wouldn't mind.  She's got to spread it apart like the fucking leaves of a Venus flytrap.  Get it in there.  Get that fucking bush apart.  You got to use your fingers.  Like you were letting your fingers do the walking through the yellow pages in order to spread  that hair apart.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Make a part.  You got to make a part.  I used to carry a comb with me.  And then I was able to just part their hair perfectly.  Excuse me.  I dip it in that blue fluid in the barbershop. 
[02:50:30]  And then just comb their pussy hair sideways like Alfalfa's hair on top of his head.  The best part of that is that was so doomed to bomb that you plowed through and it was  funny.  I didn't even care about funny.  It was good.  You want the answer to the blowing up of the town or no?  Please.  Second phone call of the day.  Coming right up.  Angelo.  Angelo.  You are the second phone call of the day.  Well, I feel honored and feel special.  Good.  What happened? 
[02:51:00]  Well, basically the railroad decided that they wanted to come through.  And, you know, all these land barons decided, all right, we need to go through Walnut Grove.  And they used eminent domain and they went to the government and effectively said, listen,  we need this town.  But they figured with all the people getting out, they had a ready-made town, but they  really needed the land, but they wanted all the buildings.  So the Walnut Grove people, they fought back.  They lost.  And they said, well, fuck you.  All right.  You can have the land, but you can't have the buildings. 
[02:51:30]  And that's why they.  Well, why wouldn't the Walnut Grove people go, oh, this is kind of cool.  Now we got a train going through our town.  That's nice.  Now we could go to the big city or something.  No, they were kicking everybody out.  They wanted that.  Well, then why would they want the town if they're kicking the people out?  It doesn't make sense.  Wouldn't you want the people if you're keeping the town?  No, they wanted the land.  But you said they wanted the land with the town already built, but they're kicking the  people out.  They wanted the buildings for their own crew and for their own people.  For the railroad?  For the railroad people?  So they took it.  Oh, they wanted to make it, uh, they wanted to make it into Chinatown. 
[02:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  It's a railroad job.  The hineys work in there.  Yeah.  They wanted the town for the hineys.  For the hineys.  And their pointy hats.  Yeah.  They needed one whole building for their pointy hats.  Just for the pointy hat storage.  Yeah.  Talked that chink a day's pay for napping on the job.  You can't even make a comedy like that now.  I know.  What's wrong with people? 
[02:52:30]  Are you done, Angelo?  Yeah, I think he's done.  Oh, so they blew it up.  But couldn't they have burnt it?  Couldn't they have just set them on fire and left?  Well, my question, my thing here is the story was lacking a bit.  It was really bad.  Why would you kick out the people to bring your people in?  Well, that's what I'm wondering.  And the thermite paint they used at the mercantile, you could say it was dynamite, and they did it.  But we know better.  Thank you for your service. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, and they kicked everybody out of, what was it called?  Pecan Alley?  And they gave everybody a blue out of Pecan Alley because they were building a...  Let's remember 9-11, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, and Walnut Grove.  What?  What a tool.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, well, now we know.  I had no idea.  Now you know.  I knew that.  For all the years of watching, too.  Then there was the one, you ever see the one where they had a plague down in the one town over?  I think it was Sleepy Eye. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, boy.  Old Sleepy Eye.  They had a plague because one of the guys was selling grain that he knew was infested with rats in the silo.  Oh, boy.  And they would show, like, the grain silo, and they'd show rats, and it was like, da-da-da-da, and they'd go to commercial.  Oh, no, because the rats were all ruckusing around in the brain.  Yeah, and they were eating and shitting and pissing in the grain, and then he sold the grain, and he gave the plague to everybody, and a bunch of people got the plague.  And then, yeah, the one where the blind, she went blind, they take her to the blind school, and then the blind school burns down and fucking kills some of the blind kids. 
[02:54:00]  Well, that's really nice.  The sightless idiots was probably flutzing around with a match.  And then she, yeah.  Then she marries one of the blind guys from the blind school, and then he gets conked on the head and gets his sight back, and she's still blind.  I know you're blind, but you can't turn away from the heat.  I know, right?  Just run away from the hot.  Run away from the owl.  Yeah, what side of my body's hot?  Hmm.  Run from the owl.  My face is hot.  I think I'll turn around and try the other way.  Oh, the fire is after she's married.  Yeah, and her baby died.  And the fire, by the way.  What?  Baby died.  It's the rats.  So, Michael Landon was obviously suffering and wanted everyone else to suffer. 
[02:54:30]  Yes!  I think that's what that was about.  He gave everybody asshole problems.  Okay, this one, you sit on a cactus.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah, just do it.  This one, you're riding a horse, and you don't see that a fist has been taped to the chair, and you have to ride it for hours.  The chair, not a saddle, but a chair.  It was the pioneering days.  Oh, shit.  The chair, all right.  Everyone.  All right, you have a really exciting action sequence this year. 
[02:55:00]  You're going to be fighting a guy on the second floor of the saloon, but then you jump off the balcony, but you fall ass-first on a pitchfork.  What?  Everyone has heinie problems.  Heinie problems.  Because he does.  It was a wholesome family show, and they turned it into these sad storylines.  Everything was just fucking...  That's ridiculous.  Where's the rats?  The grain.  It's crazy.  Yeah.  Thanks, Sam.  We're talking about Little House on the Prairie.  I think they just ran out of, like, cute, wholesome things. 
[02:55:30]  Because years of...  At the beginning of the series, it was pretty much Laura Ingalls and her sister Mary would go to school.  And chase butterflies.  Yeah!  And that was it.  And then they'd do their lessons and come back, and Paul Ingalls would smile and smoke his pipe and give him chores.  And then after a while, people were like, what the fuck's happening on this show?  It's like I'm watching history in real time.  Oh, God.  See, the chores were awful.  Like, I'm going to need you to go out there and get that hornet's nest out of the tree.  The little girl gets stung on her dumb tits. 
[02:56:00]  On her nubs.  She has to take it out with her ass, though.  So her ass hurts.  You don't know if she's asleep in a hornet's nest, falls out of the tree, and lands right in the back of her bloomers.  And you get stung inside the anus 300 times.  Much like someone would feel when a doctor is giving him bad news.  Oh, shit!  Just horrid ass problems.  Wow.  Poor bastard.  What a horrible show.  It was tolerable as a show. 
[02:56:30]  Because I was a kid at the time, believe it or not.  Child of the 80s, my friend.  Yes, child of the 80s, watching the first season of Little House on the Prairie.  The show was on in the 80s.  There you go.  Technically.  And it was kind of a wholesome, good show back then.  But then it just got so fucking weird.  You know what became popular because of that show?  That Bethpage restoration village?  That became really popular because of Little House on the Prairie.  It was like an old town from the old days.  Dad used to take us there when Mom and Dad were divorced and stuff. 
[02:57:00]  And Dad had to figure out what the fuck to do to us for a weekend.  And he would take us to the Bethpage Village restoration.  And it's an old Bethpage village.  And it's one of those things where you go in and they show you like,  oh, and this is that little pan thing they used to heat the sheets up before they got in.  And here's a rolly desk in this old place.  Wait, what pan thing would they heat the sheets with?  Oh, you ever see that?  There's a big fucking stick, like a broom handle.  And at the end of it, it looks like a frying pan with a hinged lid on it. 
[02:57:30]  And you'd put hot coals in there.  Hot coals.  And you'd run it between the sheets in your bed to warm the sheets up before you got into bed.  They wasted so much time.  Just get in the fucking bed.  Just get in the fucking bed with some kind of socks or whatever.  Look at how cold it was back then.  Yeah, they had no heat, dude.  No heat.  There's a fire in one room, maybe.  Yeah, but how long could that heat last?  Enough where you got into bed and worked up your own heat, probably.  It was probably 20 degrees in the house.  That's why they all slept together.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:58:00]  I remember.  Do you remember that place when they would play an old-fashioned game of baseball using the rules of the time where they had no fucking gloves?  Abner Doubleday?  The ball was awful.  Everything was awful about it.  I don't remember that at all.  They looked miserable.  That was maybe one of those special events.  I remember getting birch beer.  Dad, I want some birch beer.  Son of a bitch.  You know what that costs?  Have some water.  There's a fountain over there.  Thanks, Dad.  I really want to partake in the moment.  Not that fountain, that one. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  I want to partake in the moment.  Yeah.  I wanted some, like, sarsaparilla.  Right, right.  Sarsaparilla.  You feel like I'm back in the olden days?  And some penny candy and stuff like that.  Sure.  It's just like, eh, I paid for admission.  He would complain it was too expensive?  Well, he wasn't really that cheap or anything, but it was just, it was a hassle for him to even ask for it.  It's like, eh, gotta go to the counter and fucking get it.  Drink water from the fountain.  You wanted sarsaparilla?  I wanted some fucking sarsaparilla.  Or I actually wanted stuff called birch beer.  It's like root beer. 
[02:59:00]  But I wanted it because it had beer in it.  It said beer, you know?  So I wanted to carry it around like, look, I'm drinking some kind of beer.  Like Daddy.  Like Daddy.  I wanted to be like Daddy and drink a lot of beer.  Yeah.  And then drive.  Should be called douche in the cradle.  Well, the douche in the cradle.  And the marionette puppet.  Well, the douche in the cradle and I don't like coon.  My son will be sucking cock in the tree for it soon. 
[02:59:30]  Ah, shit.  I wanted to be like Daddy.  Hey, where are we at with our pig races?  Ah, Iraq.  You got some new sneakers?  Are we talking about doing the pig races?  Yeah.  We're talking about it.  Oval track.  That's what we're thinking.  I mean.  A lot of prizes.  Cash prizes.  Cash prizes.  We have to figure out what the venue is and all that stuff.  Well, we know where we're going.  We just haven't announced it yet. 
[03:00:00]  Why would we?  Contingent on.  Oh.  Yeah, isn't it coming soon?  Just like last time, right?  What are they waiting for?  I told Travis I want a list of the bits.  Did he send them to me?  You'd have to ask him, wouldn't you?  Travis.  When are we announcing?  We're going to go away again.  I said yesterday I want a list of our bits and I didn't get them.  And when are we going away?  How's Gary going to fuck this one up?  That remains to be seen.  But I don't know when we're officially announcing it.  You think he's on it?  On it.  Theoretically. 
[03:00:30]  I'm on the motherfucker.  I think we just have to, just like last time, wait until everything is legal and proper.  I want pig races.  I think that'd be good.  And maybe guys could get together, they'd get their own pig.  It could be a whole thing, a cheering section for their favorite pig.  We could name all the pigs.  Yes.  Yes.  We are talking about girls.  Sorry, ladies.  Yeah, well.  Is there a weight limit for our pig race?  No.  There's a weight minimum, I would say.  Hey, piggy, piggy.  Oh, yeah, that's what I meant.  Oh, okay.  Weight minimal? 
[03:01:00]  No reason.  A minimal weight?  What's our minimal weight for our pig race?  1,600.  I would say over one goal.  We could do this.  We used to do fatty pig fatty.  They've got to be fat.  I was thinking over 200.  Pig fatty fatty.  What was it?  Fatty pig fatty?  Fatty pig fatty.  We got that done.  Girls came out and were good sports about it, so why wouldn't they come out to do the pig  races?  Right.  Boy, we're great getting girls that are fat.  Why don't we fucking do something with this?  Maybe some attractive girls.  Well, how about we have a heat where it's hot girls? 
[03:01:30]  How about that?  That's our twist on the pig races.  Yeah.  That's our twist on the pig races.  Yeah.  All right.  We have girls in bikinis that are in good shape, and then we have the slobs in the heavyweight  division.  The heavyweight division, literally.  I would have the worst contest ideas that nobody would enjoy but me.  How about we have a meat pussy contest where they throw their cunt on a scale, and whoever  has the heaviest one gets to come back to my hotel room.  You know, Jimmy, there was a time, a long, long time ago, we used to weigh tits on our show. 
[03:02:00]  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  Remember we used the male scale?  A male scale, and we just flopped a tit on it.  They used to get so fucking pissed off at us.  Flopped that titty on there.  But those were the good old days.  We'd walk down the hall with the girl.  Like, you know, everyone's doing their office work, and she would just pull out her tit.  No one thought about human resources or anyone being offended or any of that shit.  She'd drop it on the male scale.  We'd get a weight, and we'd march back to the studio. 
[03:02:30]  Hey, would a better way to weigh a tit be to put a big thing of water on a scale, and  then you'd dip the tit in right up to the chest?  Yeah.  And it would weigh the weight of the tit being there?  Remember we never could weigh them properly?  Yeah, because they're still attached.  The same girl would have a two-pound difference in her tits.  So she leaned on it.  Is it?  Yeah, yeah.  But is it?  We might have to do some experiments in the O.A. lab.  But is that the weight or the volume of the tit? 
[03:03:00]  It would probably be the volume.  Because let's say you just had this empty shell that was the shape of a tit with nothing  in it, and you pushed it in the water.  It would displace the same amount of water as if you just lowered a full tit into the liquid,  yet they would not weigh the same.  So how does that work?  How do you weigh a tit?  Thus then.  How do you weigh a tit?  And add thus then to your theory.  Thus then.  Thus then what?  Tit in water is...  Yes, it measures mass, not weight. 
[03:03:30]  Really?  Yes.  So it wouldn't work.  I knew that was stupid.  Someone goes, you know, chop it off and throw it on the scale.  That's fucking funny.  They'd never let you do that.  Oh, God.  This guy knows how to measure tits.  He just did it.  Third phone call of the day?  Do we go there?  Yes, yes, please.  Third phone call of the day, Gus in Colorado.  Mr. New...  Boy, here's how you do it. 
[03:04:00]  You make a big bowl of water, set it in a pan, put the girl's titties in the water,  take them out, whatever water comes over the top of the bowl into the pan,  weigh the water...  All right, you've got to cut the...  No, that's mass.  Hold on, no, he's right.  You've got to cut the tits off the woman.  That doesn't work.  And then put them in the water.  Dude, that just measures mass.  Okay.  Yeah.  And who needs to measure a church?  If you have seven pounds of water times .9, you end up with about 6.4 titty. 
[03:04:30]  Nine times .9.  We need Danny the scientist to do a whole thing on this one.  Danny should do how much on this?  Yeah, Danny should do this one.  Okay.  How do you measure a tit properly?  Do we want like a certain tit, like 36C or something?  Want to agree on a tit?  And then we'll have him...  If you measure...  If you weigh the water...  What's the average tit?  Let's go with the average tit.  If the fish is less dense than water, multiply the weight of the water by .9 to compensate  for this.  See, his weight could...  I don't believe it.  His weight would only see which one is the heaviest, not an accurate measurement of what 
[03:05:00]  they weigh.  Yes, everything isn't the same weight as an equal portion of water.  I got it.  Right.  This is how I measure my...  I weigh my kid.  Yes.  You step on the scale with the kid, with the tit.  You step on the scale without the tit.  Without the girl, though.  Her moving is going to fuck up the weight of the tit.  No, just tell her to stand there.  You need just tit.  Just stand there.  Yeah, tell her to stand there.  Or you hold up the tit so you do a little hand bra while she's on the scale.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And maybe that'll take some of the weight away. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Danny's got to do this.  Danny's got an experiment.  Well, we have to agree on it.  If he wants to take it on.  Well, we have to agree on it.  What size?  Well, let's go with the average breast.  What's the average breast?  It's like 34 triple F.  Eric, what size are you?  He means cup size.  That's not cool.  Use a fishing scale.  How would that work?  How would a fishing scale work?  You put a hook in the tit.  Yeah.  You hold it up with your fishing ball like you just caught it.  Travis.  Put it on the wall. 
[03:06:00]  It's not a D.  The average tit is not a D.  I don't think so either.  No way.  That website was wrong.  I would go a C maybe.  Hey, Travis.  Yes.  What problem does management have with our pig races?  No problem.  None?  No.  Yes.  In fact, I sent it to you yesterday.  I just sent it again, so it's at the top of your email.  Yeah, it is.  No, we're going to talk to you about it after the show.  The average breast size in the United States is a D.  Come on.  Yeah.  In Canada, it's a C.  In Peru, it's an A.  But what does this have to do with the tail? 
[03:06:30]  In Mexico, it's a B.  Oh, man.  So we would have to do a D cup.  All right.  Let's go D cup.  What D cup?  34, 36, 38.  Does that mean America is the fattest?  Is America the fattest country now?  I don't think the fattest, but we're up there.  If we got the biggest tits.  We are up there.  No, because you got all of Russia is larger than a D cup.  Finland is larger.  How great is that?  Norway.  Just big-titted monsters walking all over Russia.  Babushka-wearing fucking...  That's because they include the moles in the... 
[03:07:00]  In the tits.  In the tits size.  I bet the United States is a D cup average because of obesity.  Yes.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  That must have been on the way down.  Oh, yeah.  I just said that.  It has to be.  There's a bunch of pigs in this country.  Would you take this experiment on, Danny?  How much is in tits?  We need to know how to weigh a tit.  We know how you should properly weigh a tit.  That's it.  To get a really accurate weight of a tit without having the woman's rest of the body or her  moving up and down on a scale.  How do you weigh a tit? 
[03:07:30]  I'm going to need a budget for some proof of concept testing.  Proof of concept.  We got to do this.  It's so stupid.  And we're doing pig races.  If that's what you want to do, sure.  If we could do, how many heats?  Heavyweight division, hot division.  What else?  Amateur?  I don't know all amateurs.  How many professional pig racers are there?  He's right.  I'm thinking like, you know, you have pigs, you have overweight, the overweight division. 
[03:08:00]  Two divisions will work.  Sure, yeah.  But I was thinking amateur more like, you know, uglier women.  They got to oink around the track.  They got to oink around the track.  Do they have to wear pig noses?  Well, Jimmy suggested it be nice.  So did it?  Okay.  We have to have a really good prize for this one, though.  Yeah.  We have to have really good prizes for a lot of the things we want to do.  Yeah.  To entice people.  In order to get people there.  But man, let's get some good cash going.  What are you thinking?  The women will be cool.  It'll be cool.  A hundred dollars?  Like two million bucks.  You'll have a mask on, too, so no one will even know who you are. 
[03:08:30]  Come on, ladies.  No, don't worry about it.  Sure.  Everything we've done for you, how about you step up, do something for us?  Think about it.  And where are they racing?  Are we allowed to say it yet?  No, but I mean, okay.  Why don't we get in the venue?  In the venue.  Very soon, I think someone is going to come talk to you right after the show.  No, he's not.  I got somewhere to go.  I have a flight.  I'm flying.  Well, then we can't announce the venue tomorrow.  He should have talked to us now.  All right.  You want me to go get him?  No.  No.  Yes.  Okay, well, it's hard for him to talk to you, then. 
[03:09:00]  Yep.  Yep.  We got a problem.  Again, another problem.  No surprise.  We have a place that we could definitely do racing in.  We do, right?  Sure.  Yeah.  So a cool oval track.  We got the pig noses.  We got the numbers on their back.  We got people cheering.  And ears, too.  Ears.  Pig ears.  They could stop and eat.  Music.  Around the oval.  I think they should have to stop and eat.  They have to stop.  How about we make it into some kind of obstacle course?  Make it a little different. 
[03:09:30]  Like there's corn on the cob.  They have to stop and eat their corn on the cob before they continue with the race.  Can I make little hats for them that dangles like little twinkies in front of them?  They always have to be running into the food.  The stick in front of their face.  That's right, ladies.  We're looking for you to humiliate yourself.  Yeah.  This should be easy.  For cash prizes.  Yeah, you'll get a carrot, but they wouldn't run for the carrot.  Oh, no.  We could easily have $35, $40 for whoever wants to do it.  But if you have a couple stops along the oval, around the oval, that'd be hilarious. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  A corn on the cob or something.  You got to do something.  Some kind of slop.  You got to do something fat.  Run the board to the show.  Oh, wow.  That's the second.  I'm sorry, Eric.  I'm sorry.  Oh, he said you're brave.  Well, you really told him.  Actually, yeah, I don't know what that implies.  Eric knows I love him.  What a pussy.  All right, I'm going home.  Whatever plugs need to be done, let's do it.  I'm out of here.  Yeah, talk to Gary. 
[03:10:30]  No, no.  Was Gary the one you were talking about?  There will not be a conversation with him.  Well, my special Saturday, that's my only thing.  Yes.  Hey, I retweeted the Ozzy thing because I didn't know about that, Jimmy.  Yeah, thank you.  I was very happy that he did that.  It's on my Twitter.  It's on Ozzy's Twitter.  It's on Jimmy's Twitter.  It's the big piece you did with Ozzy, which is hilarious.  Oh, we posted a video on our Facebook page that you guys recorded in Cleveland.  What in Cleveland?  With Cherry Darts, and you guys were talking about it downstairs.  Oh, okay.  And Epix did a whole video about that.  Oh, okay.  I didn't see it.  Did it turn out all right? 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, it turned out great.  I emailed it to all of you.  I didn't see it.  Well.  When did you email it?  Yesterday.  I'm a little behind.  Yeah.  I had to go to a birthday party.  It's the second email that nobody's gotten from me.  Yeah, I think I know.  What are you getting there?  And I'll be on Leno tomorrow with...  Yay!  Mila Kunis, and Justin Bibber is the music guest.  Oh, are you going to meet the Bibbs?  Yeah.  That's the Ted movie.  Oh, is that what she's promoting?  Yeah.  What else has she been in?  I know who she is.  Family Guy.  Family Guy.  She was in the movie... 
[03:11:30]  Forgetting Sarah Marshall.  Yes, thank you.  Oh, okay.  That was the one I was thinking about.  Jason Segel.  And I hear she's dating Ashton Kutcher.  No way.  That's right.  I bet you should like me.  Whoa.  She's been in Mila.  Mila Kunis.  Put on the sound.  I would like to hear this.  Oh, yeah.  Just listen to it after the show.  Epics.  Talking to Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton.  Hi, this is Opie and Anthony and a little Jimmy Norton.  Ooh, Jimmy.  Jimmy. 
[03:12:00]  We're here for Jim Norton.  We can't wait for more now.  Thank you.  Cleveland's a good city for us, though.  We've always had a huge following here.  Although, during the day, it tends to look like a scene out of The Walking Dead.  I mean, it really is just empty with just three kind of half-naked people fucking walking  across the street.  But it is a great city for us.  It's a radio show.  It's phenomenal.  We play!  We play!  We rarely prepare anything.  I don't know if you pick up the sound there, but it sounds like a scene out of a Roman gladiator 
[03:12:30]  movie upstairs.  There's vicious people, horrible fans of our program that we have to go and face.  So, we'll see how it works out.  I think they just sacrificed someone.  Yes, somebody was just beheaded.  And I think there's actually three ladies upstairs.  Are you going to play with cherry darts?  No, but it sounds funny.  That's me on YouTube.  Do you want to explain cherry darts, what that is?  Well, we get some very good-looking ladies to kind of strip down to... 
[03:13:00]  Bikinis, I think?  Bikinis.  We want them naked, but I mean, we're in an establishment.  So, they'll be in...  We'll see what happens.  They're going to be naked by the end of this.  And then they bend all the way over, and then we throw darts at their assholes.  Well, cherries.  Cherries.  That means act as darts.  Yeah, well, I like to think they're darts.  Darts can be good.  Yes, here we are.  Jimmy said it casually one day on our show.  He's like, I could tell if a girl's on her period by smelling her armpits.  So, we're like, there's a bit for Cleveland. 
[03:13:30]  So, we're going to find out today.  I don't believe them.  Well, I'll tell you...  We should have a TV show up, take it.  I knew her body chemistry, and I think the smell of an armpit can be kind of sexy, which  is creepy, but it is a chemical thing with you and a woman.  It doesn't smell at all, and you are not on your period.  That is correct.  It's a really weird thing, a radio show, fans who are really obsessed with the show.  It's much different than just a casual fan who likes you on TV once a week.  Yeah, it transcends just the hours that we're on the air. 
[03:14:00]  It becomes more of a lifestyle.  These people hang out with each other just because they're fans of the show, which is  frightening that they're procreating.  And because nobody else will hang out with them.  That's true.  They found each other.  Jimmy!  That's pretty cool.  We should do a TV show, I'm telling you.  I agree.  All right.  Let's get that meeting done.  I'm going home.  Where's that?  On our Facebook page? 
[03:14:30]  Yes.  All right.  There you go.  Facebook slash Opie and Anthony.  All right.  You going?  Would you want J.J. Walker?  Okay.  Oh, God.  He's a miserable fucker.  Jimmy Walker?  No.  Yeah.  He's killing Leno in his book.  Yeah, he's killing Leno and Letterman.  He said Leno and Letterman used to write for him.  He's a douchebag.  Leno actually said that.  Oh, wow.  He goes, hey, Jimmy Walker got this book out.  He's really pissed on about it.  Yeah.  Who else?  That and Jason Biggs is in New York. 
[03:15:00]  Jason.  He didn't come in for the other one.  Because he was in L.A.  Oh, fuck yeah.  I'm in New York.  There's airplanes.  All right.  That's true.  Fuck.  Yeah, helicopters.  Is there airplanes?  There are planes.  Who?  Julie, the girl.  Who's she?  Julie McCullough.  She's talking about her.  Who?  Julie McCullough.  We talked about her on the show today.  I've heard of her.  I don't know who she is.  She's in Growing Pains.  Where's she been at?  Of course.  Little House on the Prairie.  Batman.  Batman.  Superman.  What?  Fantastic Four.  Star Trek.  Boba Fett.  She's in Boba Fett?  Captain Kirk. 
[03:15:30]  Ah, fuck.  Gary's outside.  Hey, uh.  Jesus fucking Christ.  Yeah, no.  The show's still on the air.  What?  We're still doing the show.  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You turned off the mics.  No, actually, you turned every single one of them and left them on.  Oh.  Yeah.  So.  Fuck.  The guest pictures were on the air.  What?  You want to make out?  What?  Dude.  What?  I know you don't want to talk to Gary,  but you could think of other things to do.  Yeah, but if he sees me and Roland making out, 
[03:16:00]  then he's going to realize I'm busy.  And then he's going to leave me the fuck alone.  Oh, he's busy again.  I'm going to dry hump on the couch.  Oh, boy.  What's going on out there?  Let's try.  Yeah, what's happening?  Are you going to check?  Oh, they're checking.  Oh, they just opened the curtain.  Hey, has anybody seen Opie?  He's behind the door.  Where's Opie?  Did he leave?  Hold on.  It says a yes right now.  I ran you out. 
[03:16:30]  On who?  Oh, he's looking in the window, Opie.  You coming out?  Other side of the door.  Don't blow his cover, dude.  Other side.  Quick, quick.  To your right.  Oh.  He got met up with them.  Opie's on his way out.  What will happen?  Tune in to After Opie and Anthony Live to find out.  That's your cue.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose.  Head. 
[03:17:00]  After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next.  The After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next. </pre>
