<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The core theme throughout much of the show was a relentless and highly offensive mockery of Justin Bieber, focusing on his arrest for DUI, resisting arrest, and driving with an expired license.  The hosts repeatedly called Bieber a "loser," ridiculed his attempts to adopt a "black thug" persona, and made numerous crude jokes about his appearance and perceived lack of talent.  They discussed the low bail amount and speculated about lenient treatment due to his celebrity status, drawing comparisons to other troubled celebrities like Leif Garrett.  They also played courtroom audio from Bieber's arraignment and a comedic YouTube video about the arrest.  Callers contributed to the Bieber discussion, with one advocating for deportation and government-mandated anal sex, and another discussing Bieber's passenger's "daddy issues."  The hosts repeatedly returned to the Bieber topic throughout the show.

The show also featured extended discussions about several other topics.  They reminisced about their former general manager, Bruce Mittman, describing him as a degenerate, and shared anecdotes about their own past marijuana use and unprofessional behavior at previous radio stations, including a story about Opie's wife passing out under a bar at a Halloween party.  They heavily criticized Hot 89.9 radio's decision to boycott Bieber's music, mocking it as a publicity stunt and highlighting offensive comments on the station's Facebook page.  They also made sexually suggestive and offensive comments about members of a radio show called "Morning Mashup."

The hosts extensively discussed VH1's "Couples Therapy" and Dr. Drew's "Rehab," contrasting the shows and listing individuals who died after appearing on Dr. Drew's series, criticizing his ethics and character.  They played a clip from "Couples Therapy" showing John from "Jon & Kate Plus 8" masturbating.  A significant portion of the show involved phone calls and discussions with Jenny Hutt, a TV personality who had been on Dr. Drew's show.  The conversation with Hutt included graphic details about her laser hair removal experience and sexually explicit and offensive comments about her appearance and personality.  Hutt also contributed to the Bieber discussion.

The Grammy Awards were briefly discussed, with the hosts expressing skepticism and using profanity regarding Led Zeppelin's nomination for a live performance of "Kashmir."  This segued into criticism of P. Diddy, accusations of plagiarism against him, and Andy Summersâ€™ reaction to P. Diddy sampling The Police.  A caller added to the discussion by citing further alleged instances of plagiarism by P. Diddy.  The hosts also made crude and offensive comments about CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin's weight.  Other topics included reviews of the movie "All is Lost," the Three Stooges remake, and Sarah Silverman's video on Jesus and abortion.

DJ Whoo Kid appeared in studio wearing a ski mask.  He shared anecdotes about his son's precociousness, including a humorous story about his son's encounter with a girl offering oral sex. The conversation also included discussions about firearms, prompted by Whoo Kid's Instagram posts featuring him shooting a Desert Eagle pistol.  The hosts discussed gun safety and a video of a robbery gone wrong.  The show also featured a discussion about pubic hair trends that devolved into vulgar descriptions of genitalia and sexual acts, followed by insensitive jokes about a gang rape in India and speculation about Justin Bieber's penis size.  The final segment included a clip of an Anderson Cooper news report interrupted by a snowball fight, which elicited further crude commentary from the hosts. The broadcast ended with a continued discussion about Justin Bieber and his perceived emulation of Black culture.  The show throughout utilized extensive profanity, misogynistic, racist, and homophobic language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  We, uh, we have started our hunger strike for Justin Bieber.  Oh, yeah. Free Justin.  Free Justin. Well, he's free.  What?  He's free. He's out of jail.  That didn't take much effort, then.  All right. We've got to move on to our...  We've got Coney. Did they catch Coney?  Should I hop on that bandwagon?  Oh, wait. Justin Bieber's out of jail?  Oh.  Oh, let's get some bacon and eggs, then.  Yeah.  Hunger strike over. Hunger strike over.  Good. I was getting a little... I was getting a little hunger pang. 
[00:00:30]  I mean, our perspective is a bit different because we're...  A little skewed.  We're on the upper side of middle age.  We've...  But...  We've reached the top of the hill and we're on our way down.  But, uh...  The other side.  I just... I just wonder if Justin Bieber knows how much of a loser he looks like pretty much to the world.  Yeah.  The only ones that don't think he's a loser...  Are the Beliebers.  ...are the Beliebers who are still waiting for their pubic hair to grow in. 
[00:01:00]  But everyone else...  Yeah, yeah.  The world where he wants acceptance...  Oh, boy. No.  They all think this kid is a fucking loser today.  A loser.  He's trying to be so cool and it just isn't working.  No.  He doesn't have the attitude.  He doesn't have the look.  It comes off as so fake.  He's got a sleeve because he thinks that'll make him cool or cooler.  He's 19.  He's trying to, like, talk like he's a black thug. 
[00:01:30]  He likes the black thug thing.  He's trying to go for that.  Yeah.  And it just, you know...  To get pulled over and to tell the cop, what the fuck did I do?  Right.  What the fuck are you pulling me over for?  It's like, oh, I get it.  Like, black people that get pulled over a lot and harassed and stuff.  Right.  And they say that.  But you doing it, it's like, what are they...  Yeah, you look like a fucking loser.  You just doing this because I'm Canadian.  Canadian.  You are racist. 
[00:02:00]  In the end, it's a joke charge.  You know, he had to post, what, $2,500 bail?  $2,500 is nothing.  And because he's a celebrity, not much will happen to the guy.  No, no.  He'll go into some kind of fake rehab program for a little while.  But, you know, this kid is not done.  I bet he doesn't even go that far.  You don't even think he does the rehab?  No, I bet he gets some kind of community service thing or PSA.  He's got to make a PSA or something.  Yeah.  And, no, he's not even at the point. 
[00:02:30]  He thinks this is, like, fucking great.  You saw the picture, right?  Yeah, he thinks it's...  Yeah, he thinks it's great for his cred, his credibility.  When the press was all outside the courthouse when he got out and he's...  He jumps on the...  Jumps on top of the escalator.  Like he's Michael Jackson or something?  Yes, the waves to the media, like, look at me.  Who was he waving to?  How many kids ended up at the courthouse to see this loser make bail?  He's a fucking loser.  It doesn't matter how much fame you got.  It doesn't matter how much money you got. 
[00:03:00]  He knows when he goes to bed at night that he's a fucking loser.  He knows it.  He just looks stupid.  He fucking knows that.  We all know our shit in the end.  Yeah.  You know, we put on a good front when we leave our homes.  But at night when, you know, everything gets quiet...  Oh, when the head hits the pillow and the mind gets the...  And you got a few minutes to yourself, you know you're a loser.  He's a loser.  Oh, great.  And it's driving him nuts that he can't figure out how to, you know, sustain his music career. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, make that jump from teen pop idol to a legitimate musician and respected artist.  He just...  He's not.  No, it's not happening.  And we've said it a while ago.  He's really not good.  He was kind of a child prodigy thing, you know, where it's like, all right, he's got the voice and...  And, you know, he's young so it kind of looks more impressive than it is.  Right.  And now that he's older, he's not a very good singer. 
[00:04:00]  Right.  And he doesn't dance very well, like to put on a show on stage or anything.  So he's not getting any credibility.  Even the Lamborghini is kind of like hack.  It's a hacky thing to do.  I'll tell you why it's hack.  If you like Lamborghinis...  Yeah.  All right, that's fine.  And you go out and get yourself a Lamborghini.  He rented it.  He rents it.  He rented the Lamborghini because he thought it was the cool fucking thing to do. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  Like everything is thought out in his loser head.  And then what?  He was doing 60 miles an hour?  Wow.  Was he really?  Yeah.  Whoa.  That's the reports.  He was doing 60.  Watch out.  He was doing 60.  Oh, boy.  Look out.  And drunk, being belligerent with the cops.  He wouldn't take his hands out of his pockets.  Oh, I wish they shot him.  That would have been great.  I wish they shot him.  Or a good shot to the leg.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Just take out his kneecap.  Take out that femur.  Take out that femur bone.  Yeah.  Give him a permanent limp.  Right.  He'll walk with a fucking hurricane.  But I don't know.  I wonder the people close to him what they're thinking.  Because the world thinks he's a fucking loser.  Yeah.  They really do.  I don't care how many followers he has on Twitter and how many little girls try to fucking protect him.  All you have to do is write a Justin Bieber tweet and then they come at you.  They come out of the woodwork. 
[00:05:30]  They actually tweet you and say stuff like, grow up.  Grow up.  All right.  No problem.  Grow up.  I'm on it.  Yeah.  All right.  Whatever.  What girl, even young girls, which ones are still into Justin Bieber?  How sad, how sad are they?  Well, they're hanging on.  Move on to something else.  They're hanging on, but I don't think they're believing it as much as they used to.  1D.  Even them.  Even their old school. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  But, you know, I mean.  Sam R.  We all were.  We all were 19 at once.  Oh, yeah.  Pulling, you know, some bonehead moves and shit.  Oh, God.  Thank God there's no video of me at 19.  Well, that's true.  See, that's why.  That would be bad.  See, that's why he doesn't understand that he actually is a loser.  Right.  There's video of you and being a loser.  And eventually he'll become a 30-year-old guy if he's lucky.  If he's lucky.  And he'll realize, oh, my God, I was such a fucking dick. 
[00:06:30]  Ugh.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think he's going down the Leif Garrett road where he'll be the guy with the bandana  around his head because he's bald and fucking all fucked up.  Yeah, I like your tweet.  All meth face.  What was your tweet?  This becomes this or something?  Yeah, it's a picture of Justin Bieber in his mugshot where he's just smiling.  Right.  And then, yeah, Leif Garrett from His Mugshot a few years back, just the old, angry, bald-headed 
[00:07:00]  man all cut up from a car wreck or was picking his meth face or something.  It's just bad.  I have absolutely no sense.  Oh, that one, too.  What was that one?  Adebisi from Oz.  Oh, nice.  Like pulling Justin toward him.  Yeah.  This guy wants to say that little cocksucker almost ended up like Paul Walker.  No.  No.  No.  He wasn't drag racing fast enough.  Very calculated.  Yeah, exactly.  He goes on.  Well, if I get this up to 60. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, that's fast enough to get me pulled over.  That should have put some of the people right.  Fast enough to get me pulled over.  60's good, right, at a Lamborghini?  Then I'll act like my homeboy bros and yell at the cops.  And then I won't.  I'll resist arrest, but nicely, so they don't punch my pretty face.  Yeah, is that what he got?  That was one of the charges?  Yeah, resisting arrest, non-violent.  See, if you're going to...  And I apologize ahead of time to our cop friends, because we have a lot of them.  Uh-huh.  But if you're going to resist arrest, you've got to go all in. 
[00:08:00]  You've got to be kicking and screaming.  You've got to try to take out that fucking window.  You know who are the best arrest resistors I've seen on videos?  Rotund black women.  Oh, really?  They pull this thing where they, on every one, they're like, you know, the cop's like,  all right, put your hands behind your back.  And they start grabbing the arm, and they always come out with, you don't touch me.  Don't put your hands up.  Don't you touch me.  And all hell breaks loose until you hear the taser going. 
[00:08:30]  Don't you touch me.  One of my worst fears is having to wrestle with a big, fat, black broad.  Oh, boy.  They are strong.  I think that would be worse than wrestling an alligator.  Oh.  Are they strong?  You see these cops trying to get their hands behind their back.  It's like, stop resisting.  Right.  Calm down.  Put your hands behind your back.  You don't put your hands on me.  That's a reality show I'd watch every day. 
[00:09:00]  Skinny white guys wrestling big, black broads.  I would be all over that.  Can we get a meeting, Sam, with somebody?  I want to pitch that.  Yeah.  Yeah, set up a meeting.  Telepictures, maybe?  Is that good for telepictures?  Yeah.  Or is that a good, like, MTV show?  No, I think you can spin it and make it something for TLC.  It just has to be educational.  All right.  Skinny white guys wrestling big, fat broads.  That's going to be the title, too.  Oh, wow. 
[00:09:30]  While having coffee.  Oh, coffee.  You put coffee in the title, uh, things do well these days.  All right?  Yeah.  Can we just do that for our radio show?  Skinny white guy versus large black woman day?  Yeah.  Well, I know, you know, having a night of fights has been done by a lot of radio shows,  but skinny white guys fighting big black broads.  Oh, big black women.  Wow.  With that fucking...  I would put my money on the black broads every day.  And we want the black broads all in with the long fucking nails and everything going on. 
[00:10:00]  The neck that goes back and forth.  Right.  The head that's just...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Where their kids are in their corner for them.  Oh, yeah.  Just watching.  Yelling at the guy.  You gay.  You gay.  Right.  You...  That's because you gay.  Right.  Shouting the N-word at the skinny white guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That'd be great.  Their three-year-old kid is their hype man.  Yeah.  How great would that be?  Gay.  You got punched because you gay. 
[00:10:30]  I think it would be great.  No one's brave enough to do that show, huh?  People would love it.  Yeah, I don't know.  We just have to find a budget to hire skinny white guys and fat black women, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  I think we could do that.  I'll bet Steven Singer would sponsor it.  Oh, he would sponsor anything.  Guy's a saint.  Yeah, he's the mad salt of the earth.  Where do we start with the Justin Bieber thing?  There's a lot of fun little things.  Yeah, yeah.  He was literally the joke of the day yesterday, man.  It was like everybody was posting their memes and videos and audio. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  Everyone, when a huge story like that happens, everyone, ah, I just lost a fucking phone.  Oh, I see that on my new small monitor.  Ah, launching.  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  They're back.  Why is the font giant?  I'm not an 80-year-old man.  Let's knock down the font a little bit here.  Anyway, yeah, but everyone wants to try to get their thing.  Yeah.  The one thing that just goes. 
[00:11:30]  The fucking, yeah, that knockout punch.  Anyone that has any kind of creativity in their bones, as soon as a story like this happens,  you're like, all right.  I'm in.  It's like a competition.  Go to the drawing board and start planning what you're going to do.  Can you knock down the font a little bit?  Is it a funny line?  Is it a funny joke?  Is it a meme?  Right.  What am I, guys?  Do I got to open up Photoshop?  What am I doing here?  And then you see someone else do something really good, and you're like, I really do the  damn thing.  I think people think it's just a bit for the show, but it's not. 
[00:12:00]  I just yell at myself.  Yeah.  Damn it!  Like the Miley Cyrus one?  Fucking brilliant.  That is really uncanny.  The side-by-side Justin Bieber, Mochad, and Miley Cyrus.  Yeah.  It's been done a couple different ways.  One way was the with makeup, without makeup.  Right.  That was a big one yesterday.  Is that shit on our Facebook page?  Some of these good ones should be on our Facebook page, all right?  Oh, and a show on Facebook.  Eric will throw some of the better ones that we saw on our Facebook page. 
[00:12:30]  So where do we start?  Can we start with the judge?  Can we start with DJ Who Kid?  Can we start with the bread and milk guy?  I want to play his latest video.  What do you want to do?  We can start with the judge, and you guys can talk about how Tom Bieber looks in his prison  scrubs.  I was trying to figure out if he was trying to look contrite.  Or, like, a badass.  Or pretty.  Like, this doesn't bother me, man.  I don't care.  I'm just standing here.  Or is he trying to look like, oh, I'm sorry, Your Honor. 
[00:13:00]  I really screwed up.  Yeah, or is he just trying to look, like, pretty?  Yeah, because he kind of felt like he was trying to still make his lips pouty.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he was like, what are you doing?  I was just kind of looking around like, yeah, whatever.  Yeah.  I think we should go lineage.  Yeah, yeah.  Which means let's start with the breaking news.  Chronological order.  This is all you need to know about our media today.  Oh, boy.  It was MSNBC?  Yes.  MSNBC had a story on the NSA. 
[00:13:30]  Right.  That's something that affects all of us.  And any new info that comes out on the NSA thing, we're all in.  We want to hear what the fuck this is about.  Big news.  So MSNBC did this yesterday.  Seriously consider, not continuing.  Congresswoman Carmen, let me interrupt you.  Congresswoman, let me interrupt you just for a moment.  We've got some breaking news out of Miami.  Stand by, if you will.  Right now, in Miami, Justin Bieber has been arrested on a number of charges. 
[00:14:00]  They cut her off.  Guaranteed she's standing there going, you've got to be shitting me.  You've fucking cut me off for that TMZ shit.  And remember we were just saying the other day this breaking news thing has become a joke?  A joke.  When we were growing up, when you saw breaking news, you knew some shit was going down there.  That was going to affect everybody.  Right.  This doesn't affect anyone.  Yeah.  You know, it literally does it.  It literally could have been nuclear missiles are headed your way when that came on. 
[00:14:30]  So it was very kind of, you get anxiety when that came on.  You knew something bad just happened.  Now it's Justin Bieber is in front of the judge for being an asshole.  And they cut off someone talking about the NSA and the fact that they're eavesdropping on everything you do.  And quite possibly when you're home, they're listening to your conversations just over your computer.  Or your Xbox.  But hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. 
[00:15:00]  Wait a minute.  Breaking news.  It's amazing.  There was a congresswoman.  There was an elected official.  Yes.  Yes.  You're cutting me off for this.  Well, that's where we're at today.  So, all right.  And then we move on to what?  Well, let's move on to what exactly.  They broke two.  But aren't you guys doing the same thing?  We don't have a congresswoman.  I go like, yeah, sure, whatever, shut up.  Do you at that point?  Yeah, we're doing the same thing.  Wow, look out.  I think there's some mockery involved here. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, we're going TMZ.  What do they do?  This is the feed from the courtroom.  Was Harvey Levin just jerking off yesterday?  He was just fucking shooting loads everywhere.  Cranking his dick.  In between taking sips, is he just fucking jacking it?  Oh, what do you got on the Bieber?  What do you got on the...  Another load.  He's loving loads over this Bieber thing. 
[00:16:00]  As he drinks out of his sippy cup.  Yes.  Loads and sippy cup.  He loves it.  You know how many hypothetical questions I can pose about this on Twitter?  Do you agree?  Do you agree with what happened with...  You think he needs rehab?  Oh, yeah.  Let us know your feelings.  You're going to have to go to TMZ's Twitter account as well.  I've got to see what some of the questions are today.  We need more Skypers.  More Skype people for the show.  Why does he still need Skypers? 
[00:16:30]  I don't know.  Every day, we're still looking for Skypers.  Looking for people to Skype.  Jesus.  All right, let's do this.  This is what the judge said to Beeps.  The Beeps.  All right, he's pursing his lips.  And kind of also, like, make sure his arms are all, like...  Yeah, yeah.  He was, like, kind of brushing his arms off and everything.  Yeah, he's kind of running his hands up and down.  His tats.  Make sure his tats come off.  Make sure his tats look good on the tube, right?  Yeah, right on, man. 
[00:17:00]  Prison orange.  All right, the first case this afternoon is...  Justin Bieber.  Mr. Bieber, you...  See, here's the horse shit that drives me nuts.  Right.  He should have had to stand there.  They're doing him a favor because he's a celebrity.  If this happened to anyone, any of us, we're not the first case.  Well, fucking 30 cases come up before you. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  This is the problem right here.  You're already giving him special treatment.  Yeah.  A little preferential treatment for the little fucker.  First case.  Just make him sit in a holding cell while people lick their lips at him.  Or...  Maybe not purposely make him wait, but whatever it would have been normally.  If he was just Joe Schmo.  Guaranteed he's not the first fucking case of the day.  First case.  Let's get this asshole out of here.  Yeah.  All right, go ahead.  We're charged with the following.  It's coming out of here. 
[00:18:00]  DUI, alcohol, or drugs.  Mm-hmm.  Resisting without violence.  And driving with an expired driver's license.  Look out.  And who is representing the state and who's representing the defense in this case?  Good afternoon.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  You can go to the back.  All right.  Good afternoon.  You're on Roy Black appearing on behalf of Mr. Bieber.  I'm joined by his manager.  And my partner has attempted to talk to Mr. Bieber at the TGK, but they would not allow him in. 
[00:18:30]  But we'll be able to proceed in any event.  Okay.  Thank you.  One president, state government.  All right.  Number two, Monroe.  Craig, on behalf of the state.  All right.  Mr. President, Mr. Craig?  Just stand there.  It looks stupid.  Okay.  State?  Judge, on the case of Mr. Bieber, the state's just asked to be set.  Your Honor, we agree with that.  Okay.  What would the standard bond be?  On the count of resisting without violence. 
[00:19:00]  $1,000.  He's like, chump change, yo.  $1,000.  On the account of your driver's license.  Corrections on expired DL.  We need $500, Joe.  $500.  Nothing for bail.  So the total bond would be $2,500. 
[00:19:30]  $2,500.  Broken down.  $1,000 resisting without violence.  $1,000 for the DUI.  And $500 for the expired driver's license.  Is there anything else before me involving Mr. Bieber?  No, Your Honor.  But thank you very much for hearing us right away.  And we appreciate you, Your Honor.  It's courtesy.  You're welcome.  Courtesy.  He's like, get this kid out of my fucking face.  But that's the problem right there.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You give them the real shit, maybe they'll wake up a little bit.  All the celebrities like that, Lindsay Lohan and everything. 
[00:20:00]  It's just that the preferential treatment just perpetuates this.  Of course it does.  And they're just going to give him chance after chance after chance.  Of course.  And then when he ends up dead, people will be like, oh, it's such a shame.  All the jokes and everything that were being said, this is just like anyone else, but before  they get killed.  Like, keep an eye on this, because once he fucking does something where he ends up dead, everyone's  going to be like, oh, we saw the warning sign.  Someone should have done something. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, really?  And they just fucking baby him.  We put him on house arrest.  I don't know how this is going to happen.  We tripped to a $2,500 bail.  Well, you know, that's a lot of big pieces of change for a lot of people.  Give me a break.  What else we got on this Bieber thing?  Well, we did the interruption thing.  Yeah, and then what, TMZ ran into DJ Who Kid?  Yeah, there's always a TMZ guy who's like a cool guy.  You guys know him.  He's a fan of the show.  Yeah, he's outside the building all the time.  He asked me if I wanted to talk about Governor Christie.  Yeah.  I didn't have anything that day, and I looked like shit. 
[00:21:00]  So I said, hey, can we do this another time?  But, like, he always asks, like, people who work here about stuff, but it's usually just a goof.  Right.  So when Who Kid came up yesterday and was like, I just talked to TMZ, yo, Papa.  I was like, oh, that's funny.  Right.  But then last night it actually got posted on the website.  Oh, boy, did it.  It says, DJ Who Kid, Bieber's on a mission to be an N-word.  He's hilarious, man.  He knows how to get a quote out.  Oh, he does.  All right, let's take a look at this.  Who Kid. 
[00:21:30]  DJ Who Kid, how you doing, man?  Good to see you, bro.  Good to see you, bro.  Good to see you, bro.  I know.  And he approaches wearing a full ski mask with a hoodie up.  He looks like he's ready to rob somebody.  Oh, my God.  That looks like.  And he knows what he's doing.  Of course.  Of course he does.  But then he's got to pull the ski mask up so, you know, it's TMZ.  He's smart.  Yeah, he's got to see the mother fucker.  Got to see the bug.  Right.  DJ Who Kid, how you doing, man?  Good to see you, bro.  Good to see you, bro.  I know.  I like that mask, man.  Dead presidents.  What is that? 
[00:22:00]  You're about to go to a bank or something like that?  I don't know what.  We'll rob some white people on here.  Yo, what do you think about this whole Justin Bieber thing, man?  Him getting a broad end, DUI and stuff.  They're going to free my N-word, man.  You know, that's my N-word, man.  I don't know why he's locked up all the time.  That's the other thing that's so smart about Who Kid.  He knows.  He's not even seeing website.  He's seeing the TMZ show.  Of course.  So he's saying N-word.  Of course.  Because he comes in here.  He doesn't say N-word.  He's constantly dropping bombs.  They could have beat that shit.  He doesn't want any beeps. 
[00:22:30]  He wants TV, he wants to make sure.  Justin Bieber's not a nigga.  Yeah, he doesn't say N-word ever.  No.  Good.  He's got acne, pimples.  I mean, I was a little shocked when I saw that photo.  Yeah.  But I guess it's because of the combination of him playing horrible basketball and then  he's a horrible skater.  I think they locked him up for that.  I don't think it's for the drag reason.  I think it's for the basketball game he had, which was horrible.  And the horrible skating.  I don't know what's going on.  Have you seen his Instagram?  He puts these videos of him skateboarding, him playing basketball. 
[00:23:00]  What do you think about his basketball skills, his skateboarding skills?  I think he's like a twin of Lil Wayne because Lil Wayne can't skate, Lil Wayne can't play  ball.  I think they just came out the same fallopian tube or something.  Those guys are twin brothers.  They need to stop it.  End it.  Stop doing what you can't do.  Sing.  Get all the white girls out there and be an N-word.  Here's the thing though.  These guys in the hip-hop community, they get arrested, man.  They always come out.  It's the same thing when they come out of jail and get into the car. 
[00:23:30]  They come out and they plug their album.  Do you hope that Bieber comes out and plugs something?  I saw Soulja Boy do it the other day.  It was a little ridiculous, man.  He gets locked up.  First thing he do, shout out his album.  I think he's very ignorant.  2 Chainz did that same thing too.  2 Chainz.  I think Justin Bieber is transforming into the N-word this year.  This year, he's strictly N-word.com.  He's doing everything.  He's hanging with Lil Scrappy.  What is Justin Bieber hanging?  I mean, Lil Scrappy's my man, but what is Justin Bieber doing in Miami with Lil Scrappy? 
[00:24:00]  Equals jail.  Our pal DJ Hook is transforming into the N-word.  All of Justin's buddies are all black rap guys.  Yeah, but they're not, like, real black rap guys.  No, no.  They're just the guys that would hang out with Justin Bieber.  Exactly.  Lil Scrappy isn't, like, he's got no street cred.  No.  And Lil Scrappy.  And his best friend is Lil Za.  Lil Za. 
[00:24:30]  Lil Lil.  Nobody knows who Lil Za is outside of.  He was the one that was arrested for the cocaine.  The drugs.  Yeah.  For the drugs.  Again, the black man taking the fall for Bieber right there.  Yeah.  That's about it.  All right.  Damn.  And then we've got to go with the bread and milk guy.  Vic DiBetetto?  Vic DiBetetto.  Jimmy knows him.  He's a comic.  Yeah.  And he's been doing very well with his YouTube channel. 
[00:25:00]  You might remember him from the bread and milk video.  You know how people lose their fucking minds and they have to go to the store and get bread  and milk before the storms hit.  Yeah, yeah.  He was the guy that was going off about that.  Right.  So he has a Justin Bieber video that is just fucking killing.  He just posted it and it's up to 370,000 views.  And basically he's in a car.  Most people don't know that he's playing a character.  That's what's great about this.  Yeah.  But he's in a car. 
[00:25:30]  It looks like just a regular working guy.  Almost white collar.  Almost.  He's a cubicle guy.  Yeah.  He's got a clip-on tie.  And this opens up with him listening to the Justin Bieber news on his radio as he's behind  his steering wheel.  Yeah.  News again, and this is serious.  He was arrested in Miami for drag racing and driving under the influence.  Police chief Ray Martinez says Bieber was belligerent when he was pulled over and was  also charged with resisting arrest without violence.  Is he dead? 
[00:26:00]  Did he get killed?  That little fucking punk.  Unbelievable.  Fuck him.  Fuck.  Fuck, we're done.  Don't you understand?  We're done as a nation.  This guy, he's going to get fucking a movie now.  He's going to get a book deal.  How I crashed my Lamborghini.  We're fucking done.  Give me that money.  That little fucking prick.  Give me that.  You know what I'd do with that money?  I'd hire somebody to wipe my mother's ass.  That's what I would do with that money.  Because they got too much too fast.  Don't you understand? 
[00:26:30]  These are the role models we have for all these little fucking shitheads.  It's over.  It's over.  And I'm the fucking band.  We're the Titanic.  We are sinking.  And I'm the band entertaining you people while we are...  I'm 53.  I'm breaking my fucking ass.  Two jobs.  I'm wearing a fucking clip-on tie.  And this little prick has the world by the balls.  And just throws...  What's his...  What's he got problems?  Is it a disease?  Was he abused when he was...  Fuck him. 
[00:27:00]  Let him crash.  Let him fucking die.  And if I saw him crash and die, I would pull over and eat popcorn while I see his fucking brains hanging from the fucking radiator.  Fuck Justin Bieber.  He's spitting.  There you go.  Good job, Vic.  Wherever you are.  Yeah, he really is.  He's not very happy.  No.  With that situation.  Oh, what's with the phone?  The phones are just blowing up today, man.  What's that about?  Is it because a lot of people are calling at once?  Maybe. 
[00:27:30]  We had problems with the phones during the pre-show.  Oh, this guy's pissed.  Uh-oh.  And we can't get...  Oh, come on.  Today's the day we really need our phones.  Oh, man.  This guy's really mad because he says Lil Scrappy does have street cred.  He killed someone.  Oh, if Lil Scrappy killed someone, then that's fucking street cred right there.  So, I don't know.  He must be laughing at his buddy Justin Bieber.  Right.  Getting arrested for fucking stupid shit.  Our phones are shot, so maybe somebody could try to fix them. 
[00:28:00]  Be a knucklehead.  Oh, you got it?  Jasmine.  Yeah, I'm a girl, not a guy.  Oh.  Sorry about that.  What's up, Jasmine?  Oh, no problem.  Well, yeah, Lil Zah is nobody, but Lil Scrappy, known in Atlanta, definitely big-time rapper  at one point in time, but Justin Bieber hanging out with him, not a real thing.  No?  First off...  Wait, what do you...  But you want to talk about how Lil Scrappy has street cred because he killed somebody.  He's killed more than one people. 
[00:28:30]  He's literally in and out of rehab.  Wait, how do you kill more than one people?  Is that how she said it?  Yes.  How do you kill more than one people and you're...  More than one person.  One.  And how are you able to walk the streets then?  Yeah.  He's been to prison more than once.  That's why.  Yeah, but if he killed, like, more than one people...  Yeah.  Wouldn't he still be in prison?  And then she hangs up.  Oh, she got scared.  What are you doing?  She got scared. 
[00:29:00]  We're having a discussion here.  Imagine, like, you're talking to somebody and then you just turn around and walk away.  Like, that's what some of our callers do.  Like, we would be sitting here and be like, hey, how you doing?  Oh, good.  What's up?  And then the guy just turns around and walks away.  It was just a follow-up question.  Why did you get scared?  Because we had a follow-up question.  It wasn't rude.  No.  All right, well, is that the latest on Justin Bieber, I guess?  Oh, yeah.  Anything else worth playing today?  Who knows where this story will go? 
[00:29:30]  Stay tuned.  This is your Justin Bieber connection.  And then you got people doing hacky things for their own benefit.  You got a radio station in Canada.  Oh, I see.  You saw that?  Oh, that instant douche chill.  Oh, my God.  I used to have to be part of some of this shit back in the day.  We got to get our station.  And the station logo on the card.  Can we get some audio of those guys, possibly?  That station?  Yes.  Maybe there's like a sweeper they're playing constantly.  But basically, they're saying that they're not playing anymore Justin Bieber until he goes into rehab. 
[00:30:00]  How can we do this?  Do you think they called an emergency meeting with the PD and the air staff?  Yes.  We have to capitalize on this Justin Bieber thing.  Let's just spitball.  What do you think, guys?  When radio stations do that free zone, like this is a Justin Bieber no free zone.  Wait, how do they do it?  Fuck, I forgot.  I forgot the bit.  Justin Bieber free zone, probably. 
[00:30:30]  Something like that.  Yeah.  When radio stations do that, oh, yuck.  We're going Bieber free.  What is this now?  Hot 98.9 in Canada.  Okay.  The morning hot tub sounds very familiar to me.  Oh, wait a minute.  Have we maybe featured them on a certain segment of our show?  I mean, we've gone through a lot of shows, but the morning hot tub sounds very...  Did we Jack-tober them?  I think that would be why they would be familiar.  Oh. 
[00:31:00]  You did this year in October.  Oh, we did.  Yeah.  We gave them a good beating.  I think it actually might have been the first segment of our show.  Wow.  So it proves that they deserved it, because now they're doing this with Justin Bieber.  Yeah, of course.  But they got us talking about it.  Well, they certainly did.  The morning hot tub.  It sounds vaguely familiar.  So they're not...  And I'm sure they're announcing that they're not playing Justin Bieber.  Yeah, yeah.  All the time.  Yeah.  Which kind of defeats the purpose. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, of course.  Of course it does.  Yeah.  Oh, I bet they're so outraged.  And then I tweeted a picture of the front page of the Daily News here in New York.  Mm-hmm.  Because what they're doing...  Yeah.  My God.  Listen to this.  Crazy.  News to pothead drunk-driving Bieber.  Here's your ticket out of the U.S. on us.  What?  And instead of first class, it says first ass.  First ass?  And then it's like an airline ticket for American Airlines, and it says traveler Justin Bieber, 
[00:32:00]  boarding pass, Miami to anywhere outside the U.S.  Ah, get out.  Departing Friday at 725 a.m.  How douchey.  I mean, really.  Honestly.  You can't think of anyone else you'd rather give a ticket to get out of the U.S.  There's a 15-year-old who got arrested for, like, a string of robberies and rape.  Right, right.  Robbery, rape.  Yeah.  He's better.  Blowtorch rapist fucking ripping women's clothes off, raping them, and then putting a blowtorch to their face. 
[00:32:30]  Why?  Where was this happening?  It's just another fucking great crime.  Yeah, I'd rather have that guy out of the U.S.  Yeah, how about you buy him a ticket?  Yeah, Justin Bieber, I don't give a fuck if he stays in the United States.  He gives a fuck.  He's an asshole, but, you know.  But we need him out of here now?  Yes, get out.  You don't uphold the standards, the fine standards of United States of America, where we're all amazingly perfect. 
[00:33:00]  I shut up.  And then something was trending on Twitter, Deport, Justin.  Did you sign the petition?  Oh, I love signing a good online petition.  Oh, do I love signing an online petition.  What was the actual hashtag?  I'm trying to remember.  Deport Bieber.  Deport Bieber.  Deport Bieber.  Did everyone sign it?  Did ya?  Did ya?  To make him go back to Canada?  Boy, what the fuck did we used to do before the internet and Twitter and Facebook? 
[00:33:30]  I don't know.  It's just so...  What did we do?  Just so goofy.  Like, this story would have been, you know, whatever.  Hold on, Larry in Canada.  Larry.  Larry, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey, Larry, what do you got for the show?  I'm just thinking that Bieber should be sent back to Canada, take away his green card, fuck him in the ass, and go back to this cold country, and we'll look after him.  Are we just saying how ridiculous this would be? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, so you think that's what should happen.  But you live in Canada, so why would you want him back there, Larry?  Right.  Well, it's quite simple.  He's being an asshole.  He shouldn't be down there.  Bad representation of Canada.  Yeah.  He's embarrassing you guys.  Mm-hmm.  Absolutely.  You got the fucking Mayor of Toronto, Justin Bieber.  Well, the Mayor of Toronto saying it's just a slight setback.  It's just a slight setback, Bumble Club.  Mayor Rob Ford said, just a slight setback. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Rob Ford and the Wailers.  Right.  They can share a sell together.  Yeah.  Oh, they could share a sell together.  Hey, there you go.  Larry, you're getting crazy now, Larry.  It's like the odd couple.  I do like that Larry is advocating for government-issued fucking in the ass.  Right.  Right, right.  Sure.  All right, Larry.  Calm down.  You're getting a little too crazy here.  You're a little nuts.  You're a nut job.  Right.  You're a nut job.  All right, Larry.  Calm down.  All right. 
[00:35:00]  Everything's going to be all right.  You're okay, Larry.  You'll be okay.  You'll be all right.  I hate that the judge gave him a special treatment.  That shit's got to stop.  Anytime I've walked into a courtroom, man, I've had to wait.  You're just sitting there waiting for your name to be called.  That's the wake-up call, though.  Because you think after all these years of doing radio, we've got a bit of a name for  ourselves.  Oh, boy.  We've had to show up here and there for court appearances.  Oh, yeah.  Boy, we're never first, are we?  Never.  When Sandy Cain sued us, were we first? 
[00:35:30]  Or did we have to sit there for hours before they fucking called us?  And then she doesn't show up.  And instead of going, oh, wow, you guys are celebrities.  Let's just fucking get rid of this one.  We had to come back two more times, proving that we're not really celebrities.  I got you guys.  She did.  She did.  I don't know why that makes me happy.  I should be so mad, but I'm just not.  What'd she say?  What are you going to do?  I'm a crazy bitch?  A fucking crazy bitch.  It was some kind of bitch. 
[00:36:00]  Something like that.  And I'm like, all right.  Yes, you are.  Okay, come back into the fold.  Forgive and forget.  Until you fuck us over next time.  Which will happen, because that's what happens with these idiots.  Which she does.  Right.  Let's see.  The charges will most likely be dropped, because there was no probable cause.  I don't even give a fuck if any of this shit is dropped.  I just think it's hilarious that the whole world thinks he's a loser.  Yeah.  There's no doubt about that right now.  Yeah, that resisting without violence charge will absolutely be dropped. 
[00:36:30]  Right.  He won't be able to drive for a while, because it's DUI shit.  The DUI shit will be pled down to something, I'm sure.  And then his suspended license.  I mean, you've got to do something about that.  Right.  They'll just get a driver.  Yeah, yeah.  It's nothing to him.  Right, right.  He doesn't care.  He's going to have to fucking kill somebody.  To get that credit back up.  To get the credit that he wants.  Yeah.  Let's go to Matt in Houston.  Matt.  What's up, Dad?  How are you all doing?  All right, brother. 
[00:37:00]  First of all, first two callers, great stories.  You liked that, huh?  That was terrible.  Yeah.  Second of all, can we please talk about Chantel, his passenger, and how her dad wasn't around?  Wasn't what?  Yeah, what happened?  Buddy, you still there?  Hello?  Oh, there you are.  Yeah, sorry, guys.  Yeah, his passenger's name was Chantel.  Okay.  And she's a Wilhelmina model, and obviously her dad was not around enough because her name 
[00:37:30]  is Chantel.  Uh-huh.  Let's see.  What does she look like?  Is she hot?  Uh, I mean, yeah, she's hot.  As a gay man, she's hot.  I think she's hot, but...  What?  Oh, you're a gay man?  Definitely has daddy issues.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Oh, I mean, you know...  That's pretty good.  If you're a loser, you hang out with other losers.  Right.  You know, but all these losers are trying to come up together.  Right, right.  Strength in numbers.  To maybe not be, you know, losers anymore. 
[00:38:00]  That's who he was hanging out with?  Yeah.  He's all right.  Yeah, I mean, like...  He's just living a life.  He's doing it.  He's doing it big.  Yeah, she's all right.  Why wasn't he just home fucking putting the dick to this girl instead of drag race?  He was impressing her with how cool he was.  Yeah.  She was like, oh, shit, not only is he Justin Bieber, but he's super cool, too.  Yeah.  He literally could have just said, I'm Justin Bieber and banged her, but...  Boy, is he in a little awkward phase of his life. 
[00:38:30]  All right, sir.  Thank you.  I don't know how this is going to play out.  Oh, well, like I said, we're your connection to the Bieber world right here.  All the news you need to know about Justin Bieber.  She's a...  This chick is Deshaun Jackson's ex.  Uh-oh.  Who's Deshaun Jackson again?  I know the name.  You mean, like, a football player or something?  Yeah.  You know what that means.  You're a football player, a basketball player.  Tainted.  I would say football player. 
[00:39:00]  I think a football player.  No, he even likes taking black guys' sloppy seconds.  Vehicles nearly twice this year.  Oh, they have an animation.  Two black SUVs blocking the roadway.  Oh, my God.  Justin just got pulled over.  Just after 4 a.m., a Miami Beach police officer arrested the pop star who allegedly...  They had animation of the drag race.  Bieber made statements that he had consumed some alcohol.  What?  That he had been smoking marijuana.  What?  And consumed some prescription medication.  Oh, my goodness.  Police say the teen heartthrob reeked of alcohol and fired off numerous expletives to the officer at the scene. 
[00:39:30]  There isn't an exception of the law for certain people.  The law is the law.  The facts are the facts.  No, it's not.  Bullshit.  Wire.  Yeah, bullshit.  Eight hours in jail.  $2,500 bond.  They have not asked for any increase, Bale, because of his popularity or fame.  Police also arrested the crime of the thorns.  I hope he goes out now and robs a bank and kills someone.  Bale should have been hung there.  Bale earlier in the day posted videos of Bieber skateboarding with him.  Hey, I remember that. 
[00:40:00]  Justin Bieber's rise from YouTube sensation to multi-millionaire pop star is nothing to joke about.  His current album is on the top 10 iTunes downloads, and he's amassed nearly 50 million Twitter followers.  If this run-in with the law bothered his legions of believers, it wasn't evident outside the court.  Oh, my God.  They're screaming for him.  Hey, Chris and Kate, so far his reps have declined to comment about this latest incident, 
[00:40:30]  but it's really raised a lot of questions from people about whether or not this star will be seeking help in the future.  The question is, what do you say?  Right now, it's all about damage control for them.  Come on, Cuomo.  This is uncool.  Corey, thank you so much.  Coming up on New Jersey.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  He's done with it.  He shares his thoughts.  Why are you on TV?  You know, just...  The whole thing with this being in the media, you play that shit, and then you've got to have something to say.  You've got to have a take on it.  Something.  Oh, God. 
[00:41:00]  Fuck, you could have got those clips anywhere.  Yeah.  They're giving this, like, OJ-level coverage.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, they had the helicopter following the van as he was going to jail or whatever, coming out of jail.  I don't know, whatever the fuck.  Fucking ridiculous.  I just find it fun, because now we get to mock at all angles of this.  Yep.  The way the news is covering it.  Him.  Mm-hmm.  And nobody in the news will admit that they badly want something horrible to happen to him.  Horrible. 
[00:41:30]  That's how this story has to go.  Yes.  Right.  I mean, this story has to end with something horrible happening, or it's just, you know,  this is just a lead-up.  Mm-hmm.  Like, they're setting the table here for the big fucking story.  Just so they can say, well, we said he needed help.  Yeah, yeah.  Back when, oh, you know.  Right.  Well.  His troubles all started.  What are the odds this was set up for publicity to make him look badass?  A lot of this shit is calculated.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  No.  He looks like, like you said, everybody knows he's, more and more people are just figuring  out that he's a loser.  It's not making him look badass.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, it gets so uncomfortable watching his antics.  Oh.  We've all been there, but we didn't have a million cameras on us.  No, no.  While we were doing it.  And the whole wigger talking thing that he does, it's just embarrassing.  That's why I brought the Opster thing to the radio show.  The Opster.  Because we all were the Opster.  We all were.  We all had, that's some dumb nickname. 
[00:42:30]  Is he being the Beepster?  The Beepster.  Yeah.  Someday he'll, he'll go, ah, but he'll refer to it as the Beepster.  Because the Beepster put up some numbers.  I got a, I got a video that, Buzzy, if you're listening, my pal in Atlanta, he's got video  of me smoking pot in Boston.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  So, if you saw this, you would, you would probably have to end the radio show.  Is it really embarrassing?  Of course it is.  But it, it, it explains the Opster perfectly.  Yeah.  I think, I thought it was the coolest dude. 
[00:43:00]  Like, this, this will make me cooler, man.  Yeah.  And I got a horrible sweater, and I, I believe I'm in a bathroom, I'm looking in the mirror,  and we're just smoking a dude, man.  Just the coolest.  And he has that video, and he's gotta find it.  I have no problem throwing it out there.  Just the coolest guy.  Not because I think it's, look at me, just so, so you guys can laugh.  It's pathetic.  And we all have shit like that in our past.  Oh, yeah.  But he's doing it in front of everybody, the world.  What an ass. 
[00:43:30]  All right, we're gonna take a break.  Good for him.  We're gonna continue with our, our Justin Bieber coverage.  Oh, yeah, don't go anywhere.  Well, that's what you gotta do, so they stay around.  You tease him, yeah.  You gotta make, make, make them think that, that's all we're gonna talk about.  If anything else breaks, we'll be first on it, so.  Oh, my God.  Don't, you don't have to go anywhere else.  You don't have to check anywhere else.  Your Bieber news.  Something is happening, we got it right here.  Oh, yeah.  Don't sweat it.  Your Justin Bieber channel.  And will Justin Bieber be stopping by later today? 
[00:44:00]  Mmm.  Ah, oh, will he?  Will he?  There's absolutely a possibility.  Yeah.  That's for sure.  Anything's possible, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There's a possibility.  Yeah, there's a possibility, all right.  We're working on things.  We sure are.  Things are in motion.  That's right.  Do you watch, um, that couples therapy?  I have, I have.  I don't regularly.  Because it's like rehab without Dr. Drew killing people?  Uh-huh.  It's the same show, but they're pretty sure no one's going to die from, from this show? 
[00:44:30]  From, uh, couples therapy, right?  Yeah.  Because most of them are faking.  Like, they don't need couples therapy.  They don't need therapy.  They don't need therapy.  Well, the teen mom, and we so blew that interview because none of us really saw the sex tape.  You know, that obviously was a porno, and she's trying to claim that it was, that it was a sex tape that was leaked.  That she didn't know it was, yeah.  Right.  It was with a porno actor.  Yeah, she's on the show, and they're waiting for her boyfriend to show up, but obviously she doesn't have a boyfriend, and she was able to get on the show by making believe she does. 
[00:45:00]  And that's one of the issues, because the guy doesn't even care enough to be part of couples therapy.  She's nuts.  She just wants that fame.  I didn't want to like this show, but I'm starting to like it, because that's why.  John from John and Kate.  Oh, he's on that.  He's with a new broad.  Yeah.  He has eight kids, and he has time to do a TV show.  What a guy.  I got two, and I can't even walk up to Columbus Avenue to get a fucking cup of coffee, but this guy could fly out to California and be part of couples therapy as he has eight kids at home. 
[00:45:30]  How do you get that done?  That fucking bitch will take care of the kids.  Fuck, I might be able to leave the house for a half hour.  Maybe.  This guy could fly all the way to California and film TV.  But anyway, I'm all in now because his girlfriend, who has three kids of her own, who's also a bitch.  I guess he just likes being with bitches.  She called him masturbating on the show.  And that was one of the things that had to come up? 
[00:46:00]  I don't understand women that get mad when guys masturbate.  It doesn't mean, you know.  Relax, really.  That doesn't mean that there's any problems or they don't want you.  Sometimes you just want to fucking take care of things quickly.  Just get rid of the poison.  Right.  If you could find, maybe you could find a couple of clips from this couple's therapy today.  I don't know.  But they show John in bed napping, and they've got cameras in all the room.  And it's so obvious.  It's right where his dick would be. 
[00:46:30]  The blanket's going up and down.  And he's trying to say he was just scratching himself.  And now it's a huge issue because she thinks he's just a pig and disgusting for doing that.  And she doesn't understand why.  Why wouldn't you just ask me to take care of you?  Yeah, could you just fucking...  I'm just going to lay here.  Just make me cum.  I'm not going to touch you or anything.  And now he's walking around on this couple's therapy trying to convince her that he wasn't jerking off.  That's his big issue on the show? 
[00:47:00]  Well, that's a proud moment.  I don't know what their issue is.  I just kind of take a look here and there.  I'm not focusing on their actual issues.  I'm just hoping that some stupid TV happens for me.  Yeah.  That clip happened last night, so I don't know if it's up yet.  But if you could find it, man, it made me laugh hard.  Jackin'.  But he's a fucking loser.  He's a loser.  His wife, Kate, or his ex-wife, Kate, is a loser.  Yeah.  I think Fame did it to him, though, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They can't get enough of it. 
[00:47:30]  They don't want to lose it.  Right.  So they're doing anything to keep famous, and it's, you know, fucking up their dumb kids.  Right.  And that Farrah brought is nuts.  Yeah.  She's nuts.  One of those teen moms are fucking crazy.  Maybe we'll find a clip from the show.  Or maybe not.  I don't know.  Oh.  And more on the Justin Bieber after these men.  I like the Black Crows a lot. 
[00:48:00]  Trice is hard, right?  Yeah.  Where are you into the Black Crows at all?  Not really.  That's too bad.  Too bluesy for you?  Yeah.  A little too bluesy stuff.  But I was laughing listening to that Sweet Caroline there.  Right.  Because Patrice in the background just, he was, I remember how much fun he was having just  singing along for that.  He always, he always had fun. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Always, always, always had fun.  God damn.  It still hurts.  I know.  Like a lot.  Terrible.  Like a lot.  Yeah.  That's one person like you just want to have around.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  It's over two years ago already that we lost Patrice O'Neill.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Yeah.  We got the clip of John jerking off from John and Kate.  Jacking off.  And we also got some audio of that Canadian station that is just being completely. 
[00:49:00]  Hackerific.  Yes.  Exactly.  And I'm so glad we featured them on Jocktober.  I didn't realize it was the same, the same station.  Unless there's more than one morning hot tub.  No.  I hope they, you know, people leave their Facebook page alone this time.  Yes.  You know.  Yeah, that would be good.  I know they gave it a pretty heavy hitting during Jocktober, but there's no real need to  revisit that this time. 
[00:49:30]  Well, why don't we start with that?  It's a station called Hot 89.9.  Their morning show is called The Hot Tub, and they have decided.  Good name.  Listen to this one.  This radio station.  I hate that we're in this business.  It's just.  I'm so glad we kind of were able to make it our own.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I lost faith in radio.  Radio.  I don't know.  I guess by the time we moved to New York, I lost complete faith in it.  Yeah.  But I knew we had something going on. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah.  We were able to kind of play outside the envelope there.  Absolutely.  Because it's so embarrassing when these radio stations do these douchey fucking things.  And I'm guilty of it.  I was in.  You know, I was a music jock for a while.  Got to start somewhere.  So, you know, I got to admit.  But even at the time, though, I remember how just.  I don't want to do this.  There's got to be a better way to do this.  Anyway, they've decided that they're not going to play any Justin Bieber until he goes 
[00:50:30]  to rehab.  Why?  Why would they do that?  Do they care?  Is it that they care so much?  They want people to talk about him.  I don't give a fuck about Justin Bieber.  They must care, though.  They don't give a fuck if he's found dead in a gutter somewhere.  That's why this stuff is like, shut up.  They plaster their fucking call letters and logo on everything that has to do with this.  Right.  Hot Bands Bieber. 
[00:51:00]  Oh.  It was on their Facebook page.  They're so happy right now.  Hey, did we get any ink from this?  Oh, they're getting ink.  Last night, I mean, they'll come in in the morning and go, did you see the paper?  Right.  We got a little ink.  Right.  They're getting ink.  Getting ink.  They'll probably have a little skip in their step today.  Oh, yeah.  Around the hallways.  Hey, good job with that Bannon Bieber thing.  Right.  Whoever came up with the idea.  Great job.  Their Dave Douglas is probably really excited to see the articles coming out about their  great promotion. 
[00:51:30]  The Tribune called.  They want to do a phoner with you.  Oh, okay.  Well, we're not going to play any Justin Bieber until he goes to rehab.  We think this is the right thing to do.  That sends the right message to our listeners.  Shut it.  We're showing responsibility here at Hot 89.9.  I'm hot, and there's just banners behind him and fucking, I hate it.  And then everyone goes away, you know, it's a whole different tune. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, yeah.  How many times did we have to deal with that?  With good old Bruce Mittman.  Oh, God.  Bruce Mittman played the press perfectly for us.  Oh, he did.  The consummate fucking GM.  He was good.  And then when the doors were closed and no one was watching, he was just as big a fucking  degenerate as anybody else.  Of course.  Do you think Ozone has any pot?  I've run out.  I'm looking to get a little marijuana, a little maro-hoo-chee cigarette. 
[00:52:30]  You would be backstage at these great rock shows in Boston.  Yeah.  Taking a little hit.  Yeah.  Just to show the staff that he's also cool.  By the way, yeah, he'd just come up to you out of nowhere.  By the way, Ozone's got some killer weed.  And you're like, who asked?  Like, oh, you want to be able to say that you smoked some.  Okay, I got it.  Or you'd come up and be like, do me a favor.  Do I reek of weed?  Right.  I was just smoking with Ozone. 
[00:53:00]  No, you're fine.  We didn't ask you.  We didn't ask.  We get it.  They don't give a fuck.  His way of saying, I may be the boss, but you can trust me, boys.  Look at me.  I like the boss.  Boss in name alone, boys.  I'm more like a buddy.  I liked him a lot, but he fucked it up by just being a cheap fuck.  He was a chiseler.  But besides that, I did like him a lot.  He understood what we were about to do.  Has anyone seen John Osterlund?  I could use another poke off the Marahoochee cigarettes. 
[00:53:30]  I got my G-pen.  That's what he would be doing now, right?  Now I could smoke my marijuana.  No one will even know, boys.  You would let everyone know.  Keep it on the QT.  Right.  You let everyone know.  And then, of course, you go and tell somebody, and they're like, oh, yeah, you already told me.  Oh, yeah, you told me already.  He was one of those guys.  Or someone would just walk up to you.  Have you seen Fyron Moss?  He's fucking stoned.  Nothing worse than the person that wants to keep it on the QT by telling everyone to keep it on the QT. 
[00:54:00]  Boys, between you and me, I'm pretty fucking high right now.  Oh, between you and me and the rest of the air staff and the sales staff and fucking promotions and the fucking guest band that's here.  The clients that you're trying to get money out of.  What show is that?  I think it was the Halloween Bash.  I think that was the one where your wife was passed out at the bar.  Under the bar. 
[00:54:30]  Under the bar, actually.  Sorry.  Yeah, get that right.  She actually was sleeping under the bar.  Yeah, she was down at the bar where you put your feet up on the railing.  Yeah.  And my ex was following me around all night with her arms folded, having some kind of issue.  Well, you were probably, you know, inadvertently glancing at another girl.  Holy shit, was she a jealous one.  Well, I was a looker, though, you know.  Certainly was a looker back then. 
[00:55:00]  Well, you know, put up those numbers.  The best story was when we were, I got to tell it again.  We were up in, I think it was Hampton Beach, was it?  We were doing something up there for the radio station, and we had a nice little group of people we hung out with.  And then they decided to go to a strip club.  Was it Hampton Beach?  And then when there was something close by, maybe?  I'm trying to remember exactly.  Those are all a big blur.  And I'm looking at you like, I fucking can't do this. 
[00:55:30]  Uh-huh.  This shit gets jealous when we're just out at a fucking restaurant.  Yeah.  When I'm minding my own business.  But then she looks at me and goes, oh, it'll be good.  It'll be okay.  Okay.  It'll be fun.  Yeah, let's go to the strip club.  Look, I'll show you a little crazy, little different.  Show you what a crazy great girl I can be.  So we go into the strip club.  And I do what you're supposed to do in a strip club, and look at all the tits.  Yeah.  And she starts giving me a look like, are you looking at the tits?  I'm like, what are you supposed to do?  Yes.  Yeah.  Opie ended up just looking into his beer bottle, looking down. 
[00:56:00]  I've got to put the blinders on.  I was at the bar, and I remember just staring at beer taps because I didn't want to deal with it.  That was my fault at the time.  I didn't want to deal with it.  So now I'm just staring at beer taps.  I'm like, yeah, this was a great fucking idea.  Meanwhile, my wife is fucking slurring her speech, making it rain on the strippers with her face buried in a pussy.  Jesus Christ.  I was saying, hey, calm down. 
[00:56:30]  Unless you can bring one of these home.  Yeah, right.  Well, you know.  How about you calm the fuck down?  Right.  You know, it was my own fault.  Yeah.  I should have done something about that years before I did.  We were so fucking, like, fixated and dedicated to the radio show at that point that the horrible relationships were merely a little outside distraction at the time.  I wonder if this show would have been as successful if we had, like, normal relationships. 
[00:57:00]  Oh, man.  Seriously.  Yeah.  Because we spent so much time, like.  Just dedicated.  Because we didn't know anyone in Boston at first, so we were on the phone with each other all the time.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because we had no one.  We didn't want to talk to our women that long.  That's for sure.  And then we would stay at the radio station longer because of that.  You know, now, because I'm in a great relationship.  I've got two kids.  I can't wait to fuck.  I can't wait to go home every day.  Yeah, yeah.  That's where I'm at in my life.  And I wonder if it would have been, I don't know, if we would have spent more time developing this whole thing. 
[00:57:30]  Right, right.  If we were happy in our personal lives.  Yeah.  Hmm.  I don't know.  Well, it worked out, whatever it was.  Dude, you stayed at AF until 9, 10 o'clock at night.  Oh, man.  We would fucking.  Yeah, I would just stay there hanging out doing production.  At least two extra hours every day.  At least.  And we would go in at least two hours early.  We did the same thing at N.E.W.  N.E.W., too.  I used to hang out in the office with Stinky and all the rest of the guys. 
[00:58:00]  And we would fucking drink and smoke in there.  And I would be like, ugh.  Like the last person would be like, all right, I'm going to leave.  I'm like, you sure?  Right.  You don't want another beer or something?  Nothing worse than.  I don't want to go home.  Nothing worse than when Ron and Fez were finally done with their show.  I'd be like, fuck.  It's like, oh, now I've got to hang out with Eddie Trunk.  Now we've definitely got to go home.  I'll do Eddie Trunk's show.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Oh, God.  It leads us to Hot 89.9, I guess.  Because they're doing what's called stunting in the business. 
[00:58:30]  Stunting, right.  There's a word for it.  Your local radio station has done plenty of stunting.  Some stunting.  You know, it's the type of shit where all of a sudden they decide, oh, we're going to play nothing but Elvis music.  Or we're going to play Christmas music in June because that's just crazy.  That'll get people talking.  It's called stunting.  Did we get some ink?  Right.  Old days, they used to play one song over and over again.  Oh, boy.  They haven't done that one in a while.  No, because it gets everyone talking like, hey, did you hear what the bear's doing today? 
[00:59:00]  It would turn it off now.  Right.  You'd go to one of the other 10,000 options that you have to listen to.  Yeah, people don't fucking deal with that shit anymore.  Not at all.  They just don't.  So here's Hot 89.9 explaining their hashtag and the bad things Bieber has done recently.  Oh, boy.  Look out.  Are we monitoring these guys all day?  Because I want more audio from them.  Yeah.  Because they're really fucking hitting it and out of the park though.  Oh, yeah.  Justin Bieber.  Oh, by the way, use the hashtag because everybody's using it in the last 24 hours here. 
[00:59:30]  Hashtag Hot Bans Bieber.  Does everybody use him?  Because everybody's using the hashtag.  Hashtag Hot Bans Bieber.  Is it trending?  We need to get that trending.  Are they?  Is everybody?  That was gone over in their little meeting.  Right.  You know, let's push this hashtag.  First, it's like we need a hashtag.  Right.  Let's push this hashtag.  If we could get it trending.  Yuck.  And they're not even smart enough. 
[01:00:00]  Hot Bans Bieber.  You know how many hot stations there are?  Yeah, exactly.  We got one in New York.  Actually, when I saw this, I thought it was Hot 97 here in New York because that's the hot one we know.  Justin Bieber.  Oh, by the way, use the hashtag because everybody's using it in the last 24 hours here.  Hashtag Hot Bans Bieber.  We're not playing any more Justin Bieber music on the station until he gets some help, checks into rehab, whatever that is. 
[01:00:30]  Got to clean up his act, right?  We're suggesting that other stations follow us.  Absolutely.  In fact, we did an interview with a Dutch TV station.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I wouldn't be able to look at myself.  So, you banned the Justin Bieber?  Is this what we are led to believe?  You banned the Justin Bieber?  Who gives a shit?  Dutch fucking... 
[01:01:00]  Oh, Christ.  This is embarrassing.  How embarrassing?  This is so embarrassing.  Well, who cares what kind of accent it is?  I know.  You with a Dutch TV station, and apparently they're talking everybody, telling everybody in the Netherlands,  all the radio stations, to follow our lead, and ban Bieber as well.  TMZ, Perez Hilton, everybody getting the word out about this as well.  Thank you very much.  What?  Now, I didn't realize how much all this has happened in the last year, so I did some research  on Bieber yesterday.  Oh, a little research.  And just in the last couple months, you can go back to two or three years now, he's been 
[01:01:30]  accumulating his bad behavior.  Right.  Yes, he has.  But just in the last few months, there was the egging at his Los Angeles neighbor's house  just last week.  And they're still investigating that.  Yeah.  That's not over yet.  Disrespecting the urgent team.  Oh, oh, oh.  Okay.  You know, if I might get in here, there's still investigating that.  If I might.  Please tell me that the girls are doing a different job at this.  Or down the hall.  Are gals. 
[01:02:00]  I know they're throwing the ball around a little bit and discussing the Bieber situation, but...  How are the ladies handling it?  Yeah.  How are the ladies handling it?  Do you want me to find out?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, yeah.  They're not being as douchey as this shit, are they?  Well, I mean...  Have they banned the Bieber?  The ladies have a little edge to them, you know?  Oh, yeah.  You want to explain to the people who the ladies are for the newer listeners?  Because I want to make sure before I figure out, when you say the ladies...  Yeah.  Are you talking about the morning mashup?  Yes.  You're on SiriusXL.  The girls.  The girls.  The gals.  They just love a topic where they can just throw the ball around. 
[01:02:30]  Well, like hens.  They just...  With each other.  The girls, you said.  The ladies.  The ladies.  The gals.  The ladies.  The gals.  The girls.  Are you guys aware?  The slits.  The slits.  Slits.  Do you think women like to be called slits?  Oh, yeah.  They love it.  Is that a bit demeaning, you think?  Oh, boy.  That gets you in Dutch, you think?  Oh, that will get you in Dutch. 
[01:03:00]  Regardless of if women appreciate that.  Yeah.  The morning mashup has three out of the four are technically actually men.  They're males.  Oh, that's all right.  Rich and Ryan and Stan and whatever they want to do when they're not doing the radio show.  It's fine by us.  Yeah, yeah.  You're saying they're portraying women on the radio?  Well.  Well, no.  They're portraying men, you know.  Outside.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There's three guys on that show, really.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's just the one.  Just the one of them is the girl.  Did their periods sync up all together? 
[01:03:30]  Because I know one is pregnant.  I don't know which one.  The girl is pregnant.  Oh, oh.  Yeah, the one that's the toughest of them all is pregnant.  How weird is that?  Yeah.  The butchest of the girls.  Right.  You think they hate that we call them the gals?  I think they hate that you call them the gals.  Yeah.  I think they hate the fact that you cite Nicole as the only talented member of the show.  Oh, wow. 
[01:04:00]  We even said that.  It was implied.  Did you get in touch with our guest today and tell her that?  I haven't been able to talk to her, but there is information that I'm looking to get.  Yeah, I wanted to know if her husband is fucking her in that ass.  While she's pregnant?  Well, deep-dicking her.  She's like eight months pregnant.  Yeah.  Your aunt wanted me to find out for sure if she was getting deep-dicked in the ass by her  husband while pregnant.  Because she can't have the vaginal sex now that she's pregnant.  You want to know if she's taking it in her hemorrhoid ass? 
[01:04:30]  If she's deep-dicked.  If she's getting deep-dicked in her pregnant hemorrhoid woman ass.  Jesus.  Should I change the...  That should be the name of a band.  It's fucking...  She gets on the ball and the roids are just hanging down like melted mozzarella cheese.  Jeez.  You talking about Nicole?  Yeah.  I was like, so wrong.  And the one guy, I swear I'm trying to remember his name, it's just not working.  That's the other thing that I think bothers at least one member of that show. 
[01:05:00]  And he thinks it's a bit at this point.  Is it?  Yeah.  Because we pass each other in the hall all the time and I just, I'm still in the, hey,  what's up?  Because I don't know his name.  Just got to tip the head up and go, hey.  Hey.  Hey, buddy.  I know the Stanley T.  Eyebrows raise a little.  Hey.  Stanley T.  Nicole Rich.  I swear, for some reason, it just, I just cannot remember his name.  You've actually, when the show's off, you've actually heard their show.  Yeah. 
[01:05:30]  You still don't remember his name.  No, he does a good job, by the way.  But you don't know who he is.  They do a really good job for that type of radio.  Right.  I told you that when I was driving back and forth from out east in the summer.  In the morning, I would listen to them.  Yeah.  They're very good at it.  It's not my cup of tea.  But there's only three out of the four names.  I swear, and I don't know why I can't remember his name.  I mean, he's been in the studio with you.  What's his name?  His name's Ryan.  Ryan.  I swear to God.  You didn't know that.  No.  But I'm going to now try to remember that.  Do you think you will?  I don't know. 
[01:06:00]  It hasn't been good.  We've been in this building four years.  Do you blame him or do you blame yourself?  Him.  You did.  He's got to get arrested or something like the Biebs.  Right.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Let's get back to the Canadian station that is Ban Bieber.  Hot 89.9.  Big story in Dutch fucking television.  Angel's neighbor's house just last week.  And they're still investigating that.  Disrespecting the Argentine flag.  Yep.  Spraying graffiti in Brazil. 
[01:06:30]  Yep.  Abandoning his pet monkey in Germany.  That's right.  Peeing in a mop bucket and then shouting the F word at a Bill Clinton poster.  Yeah.  Wearing a lot of different weird hats.  I mean, the list goes on and on.  Yeah.  And now it's all come down to today.  Or yesterday, I guess, with the street racing and then the drunk driving and the drugs.  And it's exhausting.  It's not exhausting.  Not really.  The way you tried to present it.  Right.  It was.  You had to bring up people.  He's wearing weird hats. 
[01:07:00]  That's in.  Well, no.  That was their little, you know.  Oh, see.  Their little joke.  Yeah.  I think.  Oh, man.  Who knows?  Shows like that.  And you hear all this stuff.  He's trying so hard.  Yeah.  He speaks.  He's trying so hard.  How did he diss the Argentine flag?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Who cares?  Who cares?  I never heard of that.  Because he's not doing anything too crazy.  Not too bad.  Go all in, brother.  That's it.  Murder.  Go all in.  Murdered the case they gave me. 
[01:07:30]  And then this.  Yeah.  And our hashtag does continue to go worldwide, Jenny.  I don't know if you clicked on it this morning.  It's doing well.  Yes.  Ban that boy right now.  Hot Bans Bieber.  Hashtag it on your Twitter account for us.  Let's get it trending again today.  Let's get it trending today.  Let's get it trending.  That's cute.  How's the Facebook page doing?  Let me give it a little look-see.  Yeah, it's good.  Leave it a little look.  I want to see if it's trending and people are commenting and really getting involved in this banning the Bieber thing. 
[01:08:00]  What town in Canada or city are they out of?  Are they in actual Bieber country?  Let's see.  Like where Bieber was from.  Are they in Manitoba?  Yeah.  Where are they from?  Huh?  Whoa.  Okay.  What happened?  Well, they have a Facebook post that says we're banning all Justin Bieber's music, blah, blah, blah. 
[01:08:30]  One person is asking, Justin did the backup vocals on the Cockmeat, nothing but Cockmeat song.  Are you going to stop playing that song also?  I hope not.  It's a very fucking good song.  Great song.  Oh, boy.  I guess people have commented.  Is it?  Okay.  Wow, that's a lot of comments.  I guess it's doing very well for them.  I guess, yeah.  They're probably very excited to open that up.  Yeah, this radio station's doing very well.  Do you think they'll be very excited when they first see all those comments and go, wow, this is a big hit? 
[01:09:00]  And then they start reading them?  Right.  I mean, one comment just says Hitler did nothing wrong.  Oh, but why?  That has nothing to do.  Maybe they'd spell Bieber wrong.  They meant Bieber and not Hitler.  One person wrote, Iraq Army, and then the N-word, but with the E-R instead of the A.  Oh, so that isn't even nice.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  That's not even trying.  No.  Oh, one person, a little winky face, writes, Justin is a knucklehead. 
[01:09:30]  Okay.  Knuckleheads.  All right.  Got it.  All right.  Shout out to the knuckleheads.  That's what Search says.  Oh.  What's your cat's name?  Beavis.  Beavis Kumier.  He's got a Facebook page.  Oh, wow.  And he just wrote in all caps the N-word with the E-R.  That cat's incorrigible.  What a bad cat.  Bad kitty.  I really have to discipline that cat more.  One Facebook comment.  It says, I got a tree on my house. 
[01:10:00]  Oh.  It looks like you can't really post to this Facebook page.  No, I think the public.  Automatic phase one.  Yeah, automatic phase one.  So they're just commenting on the stories.  Right.  Right.  Which is fine.  They will be so excited.  How many comments did we get?  Wow.  We're our hashtag taking off.  People are getting involved.  Oh, I see.  Can I tell you something?  What is Dennis Falcone wants me to rape and pillage me?  Oh, it's not Dennis.  That's not good.  Can I tell you something here?  They're going to be in a quandary, as they say. 
[01:10:30]  Because they know everyone is checking out their Facebook page for their silly fucking  little stunting thing they're doing.  And they're going to have to make a decision.  A decision is going to have to be made.  Where they might have to fucking close out their Facebook page on a date that they're  so excited.  They're so excited that they're getting some heat from this.  But they might not be able to hang in there because of some of the things that might 
[01:11:00]  be posted in the next few minutes.  Very rude.  It's all their stories.  Right.  It's not just like the top one.  Right.  But, yeah.  There's just one about like Justin Bieber getting the silent treatment.  Another story.  And it says your format is drier than Edgar's teeth.  Oh, that's silly.  And don't be that mean to Edgar.  Where he was a victim of a horrible, horrible crime.  Oh, and one person is just completely removing any sort of mask of illusion. 
[01:11:30]  Oh.  He's pulling the curtain back when he writes,  You stunting shit dicks.  Hug.  Okay, one person.  What page is this, by the way?  I mean, we didn't encourage anyone to post.  No, no.  We never do.  No.  It's on the New Hot 89.9, which is...  The New Hot 89.9 is their Facebook page? 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, the New Hot 89.9.  It's in Ottawa.  And their listeners are turning on them a little bit, it looks like.  Yeah, this says put a toaster in the hot tub.  The morning show is called the Morning Hot Tub.  Is that Dick Cavett?  It looked like Dick Cavett.  Yes, Dick Cavett's in.  I don't want him.  No.  Okay.  He's a downer.  He really is.  Dick Cavett.  Oh, Jesus.  You see how long this comment is here?  Yeah, that's very long.  Yeah.  This is actually copy and pasted from the book Rent Boys. 
[01:12:30]  I didn't think someone sat there typing out all those paragraphs.  Wow, okay.  You remember, if you linger longer...  Yes.  Yeah, Rent Boys is a...  That was a big thing on our show for a while.  Like a titillating gay porno book.  That people were forced to read out when they did wrong on the show.  Some enjoying it a little more than others.  Yeah.  I know what your cat's favorite word is, Anthony, because he keeps typing it.  Oh, God.  I am really going to have to unplug the computer before I leave the house.  Ridiculous.  He gets on that thing and just... 
[01:13:00]  Wow.  All right.  Now it just says, cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt.  Oh, okay.  Oh, they're not happy.  They're not going to be happy that they have to take down their fucking link to the outside world.  Because of us.  I mean, some of it doesn't even apply to their big day.  This is the day.  You've got to, you know, hit it hard.  Sure.  This says Dr. Ian Smith is leaving Iraq flabby.  Oh, no.  That's not even what they're talking about.  That isn't part of the subject at all.  What about your knuckleheads?  They are knuckleheads. 
[01:13:30]  They sure are.  One person is commenting, Ant does a horrible Dutch accent.  Oh, see.  That was, yeah.  I'm not sure what a Dutch accent sounds like.  But you didn't know you were going to have to do a Dutch accent today.  No.  When I was driving in this morning, I wasn't like, I better brush up on my Dutch accent just  in case.  Right.  What about this one?  Yeah.  Fuck Bieber, free Troi Kwan.  You know what?  That's a very, very good post.  Yes.  We'll get that one done, too.  Another one says, Bieber wears marmalade hats. 
[01:14:00]  I don't know.  Should we move on?  A duty hat.  Can we move on to John from John and Kate jerking off?  Yeah, we should get to the jacking off.  We'll certainly go back to that Facebook page.  Let it warm up a little bit.  Yeah.  Let that Facebook page bake a bit.  Let it fester.  Let it fester in its own juices.  Yes.  So I started watching this couple therapy a little bit.  And last night, John from John and Kate, plus eight. 
[01:14:30]  I guess he's in a relationship and he's already has problems with this one, too.  Yeah.  His main problem was that he wasn't on television.  I think so, too.  They love being on television, don't they?  And it just pisses me off that he has time with eight kids to fly out to fucking California  and do a TV show.  Show a goddamn TV show.  And then she, the one he's dating, that's kind of a tough broad.  She's tough.  She's a little manly. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Like, almost, almost good-looking, but manly.  It's like, it's like, right on the fucking.  Yeah, I gotta get a good look at her.  And she's got three kids of her own, so.  It's like the Brady Bunch.  And during this couple's therapy, which is basically Dr. Drew's show without people dying.  Without the killing.  Because VH1 knew that the Dr. Drew death show was a big fucking race grabber.  Is that what it's called?  Dr. Drew's death show. 
[01:15:30]  Dr. Drew's death show.  They might as well have called it that.  Do we have to go over the list again?  I know.  It's a long and prestigious list.  How many people from Rehab and Sober House have died?  You got Mike Starr from Alice in Chains.  Yeah.  You got.  You got Kinnicky from fucking.  You got the Kinnicky guy, right.  Reese.  You got the McCready broad.  Rodney King.  You got the Rodney.  Rodney King died.  Remember?  He ran in a pool.  He was smoking.  He's so forgettable.  He was smoking weed, though.  That's what happened.  Yeah.  He was all fucked up, and he fell in the pool. 
[01:16:00]  That's four.  That's four.  There's more.  Oh, there's more.  Yeah.  There's got to be a couple more, right?  Yeah.  So anyway, VH1 finally went.  After, like, the fifth or sixth death, they're like, oh, we've got to get rid of Dr. Drew's  death show.  Dr. Drew's death show.  So why don't we just hose it down, hose the house down, get a therapist.  And we'll play it safe that way.  Right.  We'll play it safe that, you know, in a couple's therapy, what could go wrong with a couple's  therapy?  Unless someone comes in with a shotgun and blows their wife's head off.  Right. 
[01:16:30]  Some fucking abuse.  Oh, you got the list?  Yes.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Who else is on that list?  Okay.  Jeff Conway, dead.  Right.  Rodney King, dead.  Right.  Jeff Conway, again, dead.  Mindy McCready, dead.  Mike Starr.  Mike Starr.  I think we got them all.  Maybe those are all the dead ones.  That's all the dead ones.  But there have been many relapses.  Yeah, I mean, Stephen Adler relapsed.  Gary Busey is just as nuts as ever.  Dennis Rodman was on it.  Dennis Rodman was on the show.  Dennis Rodman was on the show.  Now he's an ambassador to North Korea, I hear. 
[01:17:00]  And I think Dennis Rodman did get the Dr. Drew diploma, so.  Did he?  Yeah.  I'm sure he's very proud of that.  Why is Dr. Drew shown respect?  I don't know.  We haven't killed people.  Well, he is being punished now.  He's got to deal with Jenny Hutt on a regular basis.  That bubble brain.  I just picture her brain filled with just bubbles.  She does look better than she did, though.  TV's, like, gussied her up a bit. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  She doesn't look that bad these days.  Her opinions are a bit on the shallow side.  You think so?  She is such a wannabe liberal, too.  But I don't think she's informed, so it just comes off as, you know, dumb redhead kind of a thing.  I wonder if her pubes are red.  Didn't I ask her that once?  We like her.  She's got a fiery red mane down below.  We like her, but there's something about her that just drives me nuts.  If her husband wasn't so good looking, I bet I could fuck her.  Her husband is super handsome, though.  Yeah, her husband's, like, fucking, like, male model. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah.  How did she bag that?  You don't like needy people?  No.  Not at all.  Oh, boy.  She's good needy.  Yeah, I mean, she likes, she's, she's seeking approval.  Loves attention.  Bit on the needy side, that Jenny.  Oh, yeah.  Now she teams up with Dr. Drew, who gets respect.  She's doing very well for herself, this Jenny.  She really is.  Wasn't she on fucking Wendy Williams?  Yep, she did a, she did a spot on Wendy Williams.  Yeah, and then she laughed at Wendy because her kids like her, and she said, ah, Wendy, 
[01:18:30]  my children actually like me, and then Wendy started crying.  I cut down that clip from yesterday.  It was fucking hilarious.  I edited it down to a quick seven-minute clip.  I watched it on Twitter, you posted the YouTube video, and it's the actual clip.  Right.  So you see the actual clip of her crying played over and over again.  Over and over again.  With us doing the sound drops and talking behind it, it's really well done.  I cut out all the fat, it's a quick seven minutes.  Go to my Twitter.  Oh, so Wendy's not in it?  I think it's my last tweet on OP radio, OPIE radio, and of course, Anthony Cumia on Twitter 
[01:19:00]  as well.  On the pre-show, we played a montage, just, it all condensed, just like you did on YouTube,  and just hit it, but we did it, like, even more, like, in a minute and a half, and it  was just like, boom, boom, boom, boom.  I had a tough time editing it because I was laughing so fucking hard.  It's fucking funny.  It was so fucking hard, because the freeze frame is her in mid, like, mid-cry.  Yeah, that's what got me, too.  It was like, uh.  That's all you see for a lot of the video is we're, like, setting up our jokes. 
[01:19:30]  Our jokes.  Check it out.  I think you'll like that one.  It's really fucking funny.  And there's a lot of guys doing that whole video slash radio thing.  Yeah.  I appreciate it.  Yeah.  You know, I support all of them, but every once in a while, I've got to take one for  myself.  Hey, why not?  But they're uploading at least one or two of those a day now.  Must be allowed to wet our beaks.  That's right.  I just like the really over-the-top special ones I want to, like, just kind of put in  my little nest.  So, Dr. Drew. 
[01:20:00]  Well, yeah, and going back to the celebrity rehab thing, not only, you know, were people  dying, but it was like, like, Chyna and Bridget Nielsen were both on season one.  All right.  After the show had already aired, like, years later, in the same, whatever, few months,  Bridget Nielsen was laying down in a park by herself drinking vodka.  Right.  And Chyna started doing porn and had to be carried out of a signing.  Right.  Is Chyna still alive?  She is technically still alive.  And Dr. Drew, he, after them, you know, going through the rehab or whatever for three 
[01:20:30]  weeks, he hands out these diplomas.  Dr. Drew is a horrible person.  What do the diplomas do?  Shifty from the Butterfly Song.  Right.  He did Celebrity Rehab and Sober House.  Wow.  And then back to rehab.  House.  And then back to rehab.  And then he might have done another Sober House.  Right.  And then he ended up in a coma from crack.  Right.  Wow.  And he was threatening to jump off a roof.  Right.  Dr. Drew had to save him.  Oh, Christ.  Come on.  But then you turn on the TV and this Dr. Drew continues to get respect. 
[01:21:00]  Yeah.  I don't get it either.  He's very charming.  Is that what it is?  Hmm?  Oh, Ant, I don't know if you know this.  Steve's going to fucking educate the shit out of you.  Steve in Milwaukee.  Yep.  Yeah.  Hi.  How you doing, Ant?  I got another word for you for a redhead.  Yeah.  I'm a fire crotch.  A what?  Fire crotch.  A fire crotch?  Crotch.  Yeah.  I had a redhead girl tell me.  I've heard that.  I know you have.  I've heard that.  This isn't breaking news. 
[01:21:30]  I know.  It's breaking news here.  It's not breaking news.  I'll just cut off.  I'll be like the news and cut it off.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  We've got to go to the special report.  What do they call a red pussy?  Fire crotch.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  I'm glad we interrupted our NSA coverage.  Interrupting NSA coverage from Justin Bieber.  Yeah.  Now I've seen it all.  All right, brother.  Thank you.  The elusive fire crotch.  Yes.  Steve the therapist. 
[01:22:00]  He's in the Dr. Drew therapy world.  Wow.  Okay.  But he doesn't have a TV show where he gets to kill people.  No.  He's got to do it in the privacy of his own office.  Steve the therapist.  Good morning, boys.  Morning.  You know, when you become a therapist, you get a set of ethical guidelines, a canon of  ethics, they call it, that you're supposed to live by.  We don't have that in our job.  Ethics.  Now it sucks.  Right?  It would be horrible.  And he just violates basically everyone in the name of self-promotion. 
[01:22:30]  By other therapists, he's considered a scumbag extraordinaire.  I would assume that some of those people are jealous because they're not on TV.  That's right.  Other people, I think, are accurate.  I don't think there's any of that patient-doctor confidentiality going on with Dr. Drew.  No, there's not.  And yet he takes people who are vulnerable, parades them in front of the media, again,  for his own self-promotion.  And his therapy, I think, is quite simplistic when you watch it. 
[01:23:00]  It's got to be tied up in little half-hour segments of television.  So I think, yeah, I think that is kind of simplifying real problems.  Yeah.  It's just, I mean, we could spend hours just talking about...  Why don't we?  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  Are you for it?  Well, let's just spend hours...  Oh, my God.  I'm not suggesting...  Well, you said we could.  We could spend hours.  You've been on the phone a minute.  I tapped out 30 seconds ago. 
[01:23:30]  Where did we go wrong, Opie?  I like this.  I like it.  I've got to get my jokes in.  We all have to try to get our jokes in.  30 seconds.  He's talking hours.  Oh, tapped out after 30.  No, it amazes me because I don't think Dr. Drew's a nice guy.  He dresses the part of a nice guy.  You think that's it?  He acts like a nice guy, but he knows when he was doing rehab and sober house that these  people were addicted to fame more than anything else, but he didn't want to acknowledge that  or tackle that issue. 
[01:24:00]  And he's feeding that addiction just having that show.  Right.  And he's feeding his own addiction.  Oh.  He's selling out his ethics.  And, you know, again...  Have we been talking for hours about this?  It feels like it.  Yes.  It's now 8 o'clock at night.  All right, guys.  I'm going to punch out.  Why don't you do that?  Thank you, Steve.  Bye.  So, it leads to Couples Therapy, which is pretty much the same show as the Dr. Drew  Death Show.  Yeah.  But they think they're going to be a little safer with this one.  Yeah.  What could go wrong?  So, you got the couples and John from John and Kate with his new chick. 
[01:24:30]  She has three kids.  He has eight.  But they both have time to go out to fucking California to do a silly TV show under the  guise they're helping their relationship, which is bullshit.  Because I think people that really want to help their relationship, they would do this  not with cameras.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is just to be famous.  So, here's the clip I was talking about a little while ago where John, who basically  got mushroom stamped by Kate. 
[01:25:00]  Mushroom stamped.  Kate mushroom stamped the fuck out of John.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  On the daily.  On the reg.  Oh, God, yeah.  That whole show is worth watching because he was just getting mushroom stamped every day.  Just mushroom stamps on the reg.  Right.  And then he finally gets out of that relationship.  He gets into another one.  And now he's on TV getting caught fucking jerking off.  This guy's becoming one of my favorites.  Just being emasculated at every turn.  Yeah, here's the clip, and it's a bit visual, so we'll add in the blanks for the people 
[01:25:30]  out there.  Oh, my God.  It's great so far.  He's getting under the covers.  John getting under the covers, taking a little late morning nap, maybe.  His girlfriend's walking back toward the house.  We're back seeing John, and that is absolutely him whacking it.  She walks in the room.  What?  You fucking anything. 
[01:26:00]  I'm in the bedroom.  I'm laying down.  I'm just laying there.  He did kind of almost a Napoleon Dynamite.  I wasn't doing anything.  God.  I wasn't doing anything.  Right.  I wasn't even doing anything.  Was he doing something there, Ant?  Yeah.  They have a comforter.  He's on his back, and there is an up and down exactly where the crotch would be.  You just know that.  As a guy, you know that whole thing. 
[01:26:30]  It's fucking he's jacking it.  Yeah, he is jacking it.  What are you doing?  Nothing.  Nothing.  God.  She walks in on him.  God.  John wants fame so much that he doesn't care if they catch him jerking off on TV.  Yeah.  How could he be, like, for somebody that wants fame that much,  how could there be so little assertiveness in him?  Yeah.  Like, he's just born to be emasculated, but still wants to be famous.  Right. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  Because he doesn't care why he's famous.  He just wants to be famous.  Right.  Well, that's...  Oh, he's famous as the dickhead fucking emasculated guy.  That's where we're at with fame these days.  Yep.  Oh, he could be the dickhead emasculated guy?  You know.  But she says, you fucking pussy, or you fucking prick, or something.  Something like that.  And then she's like, this is humiliating.  Because she knows the cameras are rolling.  So it's just getting it hard for you. 
[01:27:30]  Yo.  What?  What?  You fucking prick.  I'm not doing anything.  You know what your fucking legs wide open, your pants are fucking done,  and your hands are on your pants.  It's humiliating.  I'm in the bedroom.  I'm laying down.  There he goes.  I'm just laying there.  Scratching myself.  Ugh.  And then Liz thinks I'm masturbating.  Okay.  So, really?  I think you were.  I'm not lying.  You were such a jerk.  Where I get insulted is the fact that I'm fucking right there, man. 
[01:28:00]  You wouldn't get off.  Fucking ask me.  Like, when you say something, I'm fucking coming here and do it.  I'm not ready to throw up.  I'm not ready to throw up, actually.  That's a nice dose of emasculation.  Yeah.  Right there.  Coming up.  Coming.  Oh, God.  I wasn't beating off.  I wasn't beating off.  I wasn't beating off.  And he says it like a pouting kid.  I wasn't beating off.  You know what you do?  You say, yeah, I was fucking jacking off.  Where were you?  Yeah.  You walked in.  You weren't there when I started, so what the fuck? 
[01:28:30]  Right.  Yeah, I'm beating my fucking dick.  I'm beating my meat.  I'm beating my meat.  I wasn't doing that.  I wasn't joking.  I wasn't beating off, okay?  Snookums, I wasn't beating my meat.  Oh.  Beating off.  I wasn't beating off.  Beating off.  He has to say, I wasn't beating off.  Pull up a slice of bed and stick your fucking finger in your pussy.  Who cares?  Be a man.  Right? 
[01:29:00]  Just say, yeah, I was beating off.  What do you think she comes out?  And goes, you didn't beat off today, did you?  Some women get, you know, very pissed off about that.  I would fucking come in my hand and throw it at her head like multiple Migs.  I would just fucking throw it.  Hey, there's a gun for you.  Multiple Migs.  Did you just beat off?  Yeah.  I just beat off.  Threw it in your dumb hair. 
[01:29:30]  Shit.  I got called once.  What are you going to do?  You did?  The famous NASCAR thing.  Right.  The NASCAR was on.  Just watching NASCAR.  I was watching some hardcore porn.  I was on the couch.  I thought I was in a safe zone.  And my chick at the time came into the room and I was able to just turn the TV to anything.  And she walks in to see NASCAR on the TV and she knows damn well I wasn't even close to a NASCAR fan. 
[01:30:00]  Because you have a tent in your sweatpants.  Oh, I love that.  How big of a NASCAR fan are you?  Wow.  Jeff Gordon is just amazing.  That's great.  Look how fast they're going.  I just laughed it off.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  I'm not going to sit there and follow you around the house going,  God, I wasn't beating off, okay?  Hey, don't.  I swear.  Don't accuse me of that.  I wasn't doing it.  It was the Warriors.  All guys beat off.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  Stop it.  Period.  Jacket.  But women get very insulted.  Of course.  I'm going to be upset by that.  Some.  I don't know what that's all about.  It has nothing to do with you.  Don't be so self-centered.  Right.  You fucking bitch.  Sometimes you just want to beat off.  Fuck it.  Exactly.  Like it takes no effort.  Exactly.  It would be like calling you to pick my nose.  Right.  It's like, why would I fuck in?  It's the same thing.  I use it as a sleep aid.  It's a sleeping pill. 
[01:31:00]  I'm serious.  It's like Ambien.  Sometimes if I'm having a little insomnia.  That's it.  I know I can work as a sleep aid.  Yes.  Plus, what are you going to do?  You see her sleep next to you.  You know, okay.  It's either like I wake her up.  Wake up.  Get her going.  Then see if she, or just go to the bathroom and jerk off her.  Yeah.  I'm done in five minutes.  And then it takes fucking work on your part.  You know, maybe you're not ready to put in the effort to, you know, make her feel good.  Right.  At that point.  It would be an insult to do it.  Right.  To actually initiate some type of sexual contact if you're not into, you know, 100%. 
[01:31:30]  Right.  Plus, you just get a video on your phone.  It takes, it's nothing.  It's 2014.  Just go jerk off.  The tools that are available for people to jack off now, just leaps and bounds over  the old days.  It's almost betraying technology not to use them.  True.  You know, people have literally sacrificed lives to give you the porno that you can jerk off  to very quickly.  Right.  Moving pictures.  That was unheard of in jack off days of yore. 
[01:32:00]  Right.  You had to fucking find a magazine of some sort.  And a lot of times it wasn't porno.  It could have been Cosmo.  It could have been a fucking catalog with bra ads in it.  It could have been anything.  The thought of being able to, at any minute, jerk off to moving fucking film picture things  is astounding that we've gotten this far.  And to not utilize that is an insult to technology.  Yeah.  I say holla.  Yeah.  Holla to that. 
[01:32:30]  By the way, Jenny Hutch has tweeted.  Oh, did she?  The needy Jenny?  She had to get right on it, right?  Of course.  Darth Mode on Twitter.  A good egg on Twitter.  He writes, hey, Jenny Hutt, good morning, Bubblehead.  Bubblehead.  But he writes, good morning, Bubblehead, via OP radio.  So then Jenny Hutt retweeted that and just writes, oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  She knows.  Oh, we love you.  Don't we? 
[01:33:00]  Hey, we gave you a compliment.  I said, if your husband wasn't so attractive, I bet I could fuck you.  Right.  Put everything into context, please.  Yeah, yeah.  Take the good with the bad, you know.  Can you go back to the John clip, see if there's any more?  There might be one more little bit.  But this is his fame.  He has to now, like, walk around.  Yeah.  Trying to convince his new chick that he didn't fucking jerk off.  He didn't beat off.  Beat off.  Whining about jerking.  Just be a man. 
[01:33:30]  Right.  What are you going to do?  Fess up to it and tell her to go fuck herself.  Even if you weren't, like, at that point, just say you were.  Yeah.  Just to prove a compliment.  Yeah, I was.  Right.  There.  Now what?  I just want to...  Almost therapy, my dick.  Just go back slightly, just in case.  I want to hear the part where he has to say he wasn't doing it anyway.  As she's laying down, laughing at him.  Yeah, laughing.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Oh, no.  What happened?  Like this commercial, sure.  This is bad.  It says add one of five. 
[01:34:00]  No way.  What?  It's gotten to that point now?  That's no way.  That show isn't worth five ads on the internet?  No.  Nothing's worth five ads.  Hell fucking no.  Move right along there.  I'll deal with an ad here and there.  I don't care.  Yeah, yeah.  I like the ones you get opt out of after five seconds.  But that is a long five seconds when you sit there.  You just watch that clock.  One.  Damn, you can't click it fast enough.  Oh, God.  You skip it.  Ah!  Right.  Yeah, five seconds is... 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  All right, so, fuck it.  We're not going to get the rest of the clip.  I want to hear him talk about beating off more.  So do I.  So do I.  What a pussy.  All right, let's go to Renee in Cleveland.  I was hoping a few...  Renee.  A few women would call on this.  Renee.  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Hello.  Wow.  You know what?  But I don't understand what a fucking chick's problem is if she's got a problem with her  man beating off.  First, if she wasn't there...  But I wasn't beating off.  I mean, he's got to take matters into his own hands. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah.  Where was she coming in from, by the way?  Right.  Well, if she was taking the kids to school or whatever...  Whatever.  Good opportunity.  I masturbate probably three times a day.  Whoa.  And I go to bed at night.  It's insulting.  And, you know, like Opie said, it was like, I use it for a sleep aid if I can't sleep.  It always helps, you know?  You've got to rub one out.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  So guys are made differently than women, and women who don't...  Apparently not with you, you horny bitch. 
[01:35:30]  You know?  Jesus.  You fucking nympho.  You're just diddling yourself.  We've got to get you to masturbate right now.  Let's go old school.  Yeah.  What do you say, ladies?  Let's get this done.  Come on.  Dip in.  Let's go old school and get one done today.  Put a finger in the old honeypot.  You know, it's an insecurity problem on women.  It's like, you know, so like they don't masturbate when their guy's not around.  Hey, what do you fantasize about when you're diddling yourself three times a day? 
[01:36:00]  What's your big good fantasy?  Um, another chick, you know?  Oh, yeah?  Probably somebody that I haven't met or, you know...  Are you a lesbo, or that's just kind of a fantasy?  No, it's a fantasy.  Fucking girls.  That's hilarious.  Imagine that.  Yeah, I was jerking off last night.  I like thinking of another man.  It's my fantasy.  I'm straight, but, you know, I beat off.  I like thinking of another guy.  Women are just another fucking breed of animal. 
[01:36:30]  It's my fantasy, you know?  Oh, that's it.  Hey, I'm as straight as the next guy.  But, you know, a nice, handsome man I think about while I'm jerking off.  Well, there's sometimes a guy...  Imagine having the breed of a lesbian.  Well, not even a lesbian.  Of a woman.  It's just a girl.  Of a girl.  They could do that, and it's just like, oh, okay, the chick, you know...  I'm all man, but, you know...  All man, but, you know...  I like jerking off thinking I'm holding a big set of balls in one hand, cock in my mouth,  and I'm just jacking off.  You know? 
[01:37:00]  But I'm a guy.  I'm all man.  That's my fantasy.  With my lovely wife for eight years, got three kids.  Three beautiful kids.  Well, it's my fantasy.  It's just a fantasy, guys, you know.  I'm sorry, Bill.  Yeah, yeah.  I apologize that Bill had worked.  A nice, big workman's hairy knuckle up my bunghole.  That's my fantasy.  But women, man...  They throw that shit out there like it's no big fucking deal.  And I bet it's all romantic. 
[01:37:30]  I also watch some of these Housewives shows, and one of the things on the Housewives, they  like to feel each other's breast implants a lot, and I think the same thing you were  just doing, like, in a woman's world that is completely accepted in a lot of their circles,  like, oh, let me feel, oh, yeah, that you feel, and I'm just imagining you hanging around  with your guys like, hey, Mitch, your balls look great in those pants.  Let me give them a feel.  Yeah, that's cool.  What a great set of balls you have.  And then they just go back to drinking their martinis or whatever. 
[01:38:00]  Watching the game.  Like, it's no big deal.  Sure.  They don't even ask.  They just go all in with their hands, like, boom, right away.  Bob, is that your cock in the front there?  Let me...  That is your cock, right?  I wasn't sure if it was just a fold in the pants or your cock, but that's your cock.  I'm feeling it.  Just a completely different mindset.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Anyway, Renee.  All right.  You're awesome.  I love you guys. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, that's good.  Think about us when you diddle.  Well, yeah.  I will next time.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Renee.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  She is such a lesbian.  Oh, yeah.  Come on.  You hear the voice, right?  It's like...  Leaning toward...  Wah, wah, wah.  Dike.  A dyke?  A butch?  A butch?  All butchy?  We got...  Who's this?  It's Jenny.  How are you?  Oh, Jenny.  Oh, hi, needy.  Oh, Mubblehead.  Hey, Mubblehead. 
[01:39:00]  Hey, Mubblehead.  Why are you doing this?  Doing what?  Calling us.  Aw.  Someone from the studio called me.  Oh, okay.  Oh, okay.  Oh, we called you.  Oh, that's different.  Oh, then I hear you an apology, Jenny.  We want to know how you're covering the Bieber thing with that Dr. Drew guy.  You know, the murderer, Dr. Drew?  Stop it.  He's a good man.  But does he ever talk about all the people he has killed?  Does he have a thousand-yard stare like he was in the NOM? 
[01:39:30]  Does he show any guilt whatsoever?  Yeah.  That his death show has killed so many?  I don't think his show has killed people.  I think the disease of addiction has killed people.  Does he have PTSD from just seeing so many people die?  He does not have PTSD, boys.  Oh.  You know, his show has killed a lot of people, right?  Yeah.  Because those people were addicted.  Yeah, but I wanted to...  They were addicted to fame. 
[01:40:00]  Yeah.  I do want to say something to you guys.  Oh, yeah.  Women who are offended by men who jerk off, it's absurd.  That's all.  I don't know.  That is good.  Why would any girl care?  Good thing, because I'm jerking off right now, Jenny.  Oh, boy, are we.  Well, you're on the phone.  I was talking about you.  I was saying that of late, over the past year or so, you've slapped yourself together pretty nice.  I think you look a lot better these days.  You look great.  You definitely took care of all your problem areas. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah, some of your problem areas that we noticed when you first came in are really...  You tightened up a lot of that shit.  You clean up nice.  Right.  Thank you.  And I was saying, I gave you a very good compliment.  I said that if your husband wasn't so good looking, I could probably fuck you.  Wow.  Well, that has a whole lot of layers.  Yeah.  Well, it sure does.  Yeah, yeah.  I think that you are very appealing, and were I not in a committed relationship with my husband, 
[01:41:00]  whom I love and have been with for 18 years, then maybe there could be something else.  Wow.  Whoa.  And you live by me, too, so it would just be a hop, skip, and a fuck, right?  Yeah, indeed it would.  But again, my fear is forcing you.  Right, right.  I know.  Believe me, your husband's very attractive.  As a matter of fact, when I jerk off, I fantasize about him.  You know, me, him, just grabbing each other's cocks.  It's just my fantasy, though. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, it's a fantasy.  I'm all straight.  Don't worry about it.  I'm not gay.  But sometimes I just imagine my tongue buried fucking molar deep in a man's asshole.  Aye, aye, aye.  Hey, what's your thoughts on Justin Bieber?  We're lucky enough to have a big TV star on our show today.  I think he's a snot head.  Whoa!  Hey, hey, hey.  He's coming from the bubble head.  Did you hit the dump button there?  I hope so.  Listen, I think that little boy, he needs to grow up, and he needs to knock it off. 
[01:42:00]  That's it.  Wow.  Sounding just like a mom.  I'm so proving that she's a bubble head.  You hear how small?  See what I mean?  How shallow that was?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  All right, that's a good take on it, I think.  Are you good?  When are you on TV again?  She heard that?  The bubble head part.  Whatever.  On Monday.  Our show's back Monday.  Monday?  Why Monday?  Is Dr. Drew attending another funeral? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, what celebrity did he kill this week?  One of the guys that he's helping, and it's the addiction that did it.  I have to tell you that you guys...  Not the fact that he's giving these people false hope.  Right.  But his silly diplomas.  Oh, I'm sorry, Jenny.  What was that?  I just was saying that you guys have the best show, and I listen every morning.  Every time I drop my kids off at school.  See, then it makes it hard to beat her up when she says that.  I know.  You can beat me up. 
[01:43:00]  I can take it.  Jenny, you're a natural redhead, right?  Yes.  Okay.  And the pubes are still red?  There's not much there.  Yeah, but if you let it grow in...  She can't.  Right?  Yeah.  It would be red?  She can.  Old age.  It really starts falling out.  Does it fuck with the follicles down there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Pubic balding?  No, no, no.  You got pubic balding?  Oh, you're lasered?  Oh, man.  You don't like that?  No, because if she ever did break up with her very attractive husband, and then I could 
[01:43:30]  fuck her, I would want to see like a fucking red bush.  I want that red bush.  But the bush, first of all, I grew up, as you guys know, I'm old.  So my generation does not like much hair in the pubic area.  Well, but when you were growing up, you had a lot of hair.  Red hair, yes, red.  Oh, did it just look great down there?  Was it like nice red or Ronald McDonald red down there?  No, I was never Ronald McDonald red, but I can't say that I've ever been turned on by 
[01:44:00]  my own vagina.  Nice pink lips.  She could put on a red merkin.  Yeah, yeah, you could throw that on.  Yeah, redheads have a pink...  A pink hue.  Yeah, more of a pink hue down there.  Does she have a pinkish hue?  Yeah, yeah.  That's nice.  I kind of like that.  But you lasered it?  Does that work?  Or does it grow in like an old dog, whole matted, fucking mangy?  Oh, I missed a spot.  No. 
[01:44:30]  It takes a couple years.  You have to do it for a while to laser.  Just hair growing out of it in one spot like Richard Thomas' mole.  Oh, God.  Like John Boy's mole.  What?  It does...  It grows...  It's got to still grow in, though.  I heard that lasering doesn't completely work.  It does completely work if you do it over a couple of years.  So you have to do it regularly for several years.  Did it hurt your snatch?  It hurt like a motherfucker.  Did it?  Wow. 
[01:45:00]  You're crazy now.  You need someone to kiss it all better?  I'm good, thanks.  All right.  We got to let this Jenny Hut go.  Are you still doing a radio show?  Yes.  It's 10 o'clock this morning.  I'll be on the air.  How much do you get paid to do that?  You still get nothing?  Not a lot.  Very little dough.  Yeah.  But you're a television fucking personality now.  Right.  You should use that.  I do that, too.  It's your advantage.  Right.  The goal of the company is to have people do radio shows completely for free.  What?  That's the goal.  That's their goal. 
[01:45:30]  Close for me.  What is it, like 200 bucks you're getting?  I'm certainly not making bank, but that's okay.  I love what I do.  Bank.  But how can they, like, allow that?  Why don't you just do a podcast?  Right.  Yeah, go podcast.  That's free, too.  All right, Jenny Hut.  I'm right down the road, Jenny, if you need a dick in that ass.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  We just do karaoke.  Or karaoke.  You'd want anal sex, though?  I would want to fuck her in that ass. 
[01:46:00]  Jenny, yeah.  I'm having a poker game Saturday if you want to drop by and have a beverage or something.  Oh, maybe we will.  Okay.  Where are you at with Martha Stewart's daughter?  Leave GQ at home.  Somewhere.  She stopped talking to me years ago.  Still.  What a cunt.  Damn.  What a twat.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Well, you know it's true.  I don't know why you're so scared to say it. 
[01:46:30]  Jenny, agree or disagree?  Martha Stewart's stock has dropped over the years.  Don't worry about the Martha Stewart empire.  I'm not worried about that.  You know her daughter's a cunt.  You've moved on to a murderous doctor.  She was a complete twat to you during the radio show, which was too bad,  because you guys did well together.  Yeah.  That's how I know about you.  It was fun.  But why aren't you calling her out yet?  Because there's no need to.  Frankly, I am happy in my life, and she didn't like me, and that's okay.  That's her own stuff. 
[01:47:00]  It's not about me.  So why would I hate someone just because they don't like me?  And she would tell you that she didn't like you?  Well, I think her behavior kind of told me.  Oh, boy, did it.  Stop talking to me.  It was over.  Done.  Drop me like you.  Hey, Jenny.  I don't even know what.  Jenny, that daughter of yours got red hair?  All right.  Jesus.  No.  Goodbye.  Jenny Hut, everyone.  Jenny Hut.  She rules.  Jenny's a good egg.  She's funny.  J-E-N-N-Y-H-U-T-T on Twitter. 
[01:47:30]  Jenny Hut.  Yeah.  We're going to break here, I think.  All righty.  All right.  That should be fun to watch.  Awards season.  You think Justin Bieber will be there?  Oh.  Is that the buzz?  Will Justin Bieber be at the Grammy Sunday?  Um, I doubt it.  I think I'm so out when it comes to music, sadly.  Yeah.  Is there even a rock category at this point? 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, I mean, there's a category.  Radioactive's up for song of the year?  Yeah, for record.  I don't think it's that one.  I don't think it's that one.  I don't think it's that one.  I don't think it's that one.  Radioactive's.  Radioactive's.  I know that radioactive song.  They played the shit out of it over the summer.  It's kind of a cool sounding song.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I think we did.  Cashmere's up for a...  We did this.  What?  We did this.  What are you talking about?  When they announced the nominees?  Right.  Cashmere from Zeppelin's up for best song of the year?  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  It's about time. 
[01:48:30]  It's about time it got its due.  Yeah.  How do you call your song Cashmere?  It's actually Zeppelin.  It is.  Is it?  Yeah.  Oh, then I could see how they would.  Wait, is that first song of the year for real?  Yes.  But why?  Why is...  I don't get it.  This is its best rock performance.  Oh, okay.  It must have been off a live...  All right.  Who's in the best rock performance?  You've got Always Alright, Alabama Shakes.  Right.  It's a good band.  Mm-hmm.  The stars are out tonight.  David Bowie.  Mm-hmm.  Radioactive by Imagine Dragons.  You were just singing.  Well, no. 
[01:49:00]  I was joking.  I do know Imagine Dragons, their version of that.  They covered it, though.  Okay.  They covered it from The Firm.  Uh-huh.  Cashmere, Led Zeppelin.  Mm-hmm.  My God is the Sun, Queens of the Stone Age.  A band I should be more into.  They're a good band.  Of course.  And I'm Shaken by Jack White.  That's a great song.  I love that song.  Where did they do a live performance of Cashmere?  Track Firm.  It was on the live record.  Yeah, they put out Celebration Day. 
[01:49:30]  But was that a newer performance or some old shit they had laying around?  Yeah, or an old performance.  Right.  I think it was a newer performance.  That was their, uh, O2 reunion.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.  So it's old.  That's 12 years old.  11.  But it's still like, eh.  Let me hear some of this.  The greatest band in the history of rock and roll sold 300 million records.  Is it going to be, in the days of my youth, I was told.  That's not how he did it. 
[01:50:00]  No, it's not.  But that's not bad.  But then again, that's 2002.  So they did this in 2002, but then released it in 2012, so they get nominated now?  Yeah.  That's horse shit.  Not as bad as you make it out to be like.  No, they're cutting every pie thing out.  Oh, this is a fucking terrible one. 
[01:50:30]  See?  They're not showing a thing.  That's fucking cool.  Yes.  In cinemas, October 2012, that was a movie?  Yeah, I guess.  Concert movie.  Fuck.  Why isn't that on demand somewhere?  Give me a copy of that.  I'll check that out.  I'll check it out.  I like a good rock documentary.  I want to hear Kashmir.  Do you want to hear the song?  We got the song.  Yeah.  Let's hear a little of that. 
[01:51:00]  Let's hear Robert Plant destroy that.  You might have to fast forward a little bit.  It takes a while for him to say.  Well, like every Zeppelin song.  I shouldn't have been nominated this year.  No, that's silly.  So what he's done in, well, that was 2002.  Yeah.  Yeah, but he just took 10 years to release it.  I mean, that's bullshit for everybody else that actually made songs.  Yeah, you can't do that.  Of course.  It's very silly.  It doesn't make any sense.  Do we have Jack White, I'm Shaken, as a rejoiner?  Are we fixing our rejoiners, making them a little more current and hipper and stuff?  Yeah, it's just tough to make them more current and have a rock vibe, because there's so few 
[01:51:30]  good rock songs anymore.  We don't even have a rock vibe, just a cool music vibe, no matter what the song is.  I don't even mind that Royals song.  That's a good song.  Oh, God, yeah.  Anyway, Grammy's Sunday.  What about Lord?  What about Lord?  I'm sure she's nominated.  She wouldn't be in the rock category, I wouldn't think.  Well, it should be.  Royals.  By the way, that was best rock performance.  Right.  Not best rock song.  Okay.  Uh-huh.  What's best rock song? 
[01:52:00]  What's Ain't Messin' Around?  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Cut Me Some Slack?  Mm-hmm.  That's the Dave Grohl, McCartney thing, right?  Oh, and I had to put Chris Novoselic on it.  Oh, that was a charity thing.  Uh, from Sound City.  Oh, God.  What?  From Sound City, from the dock.  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, Doom and Gloom.  Yeah.  Rolling Stones, obviously.  Uh, God is Dead, Black Sabbath, Panic Station, Muse.  Uh, I just don't know music anymore. 
[01:52:30]  Fuck.  You don't know Muse?  Oh, you shouldn't know that.  No, I know Muse, but I don't even know if I know Panic Station.  I like Muse, too.  I hope Black Sabbath loses, so Jimmy can just lose his mind on Monday when we come back.  Right.  And listen to him go, what?  Yeah, you know, of course.  Why would they give it to, you know, Ozzy and...  I don't see how Black Sabbath could win.  The Rolling Stones and Dave Grohl and McCartney.  It's the best song on there.  Stop it.  Of course, though.  Of course they don't win. 
[01:53:00]  We have the dates wrong of what?  I did Grammys.  Allen, Kentucky, fast.  You guys have this up on dates wrong.  That was a 2007 concert they did.  Oh, well, excuse me.  It's still old.  It's still old.  Okay.  Well, yeah, and they released the DVD in 2012, I think.  But it was an 07 concert.  It's the one where 20 million people signed up to get tickets until 20,000 people got to go.  That's amazing.  Should have got a bigger venue.  Maybe check it out.  For real, it's a Blu-ray, too. 
[01:53:30]  Check it out.  Really?  All right.  Let me say hi to Kevin in Louisiana.  Kevin.  Yeah, I just wanted to let you guys hear a song.  P. Dottie played it for the Godzilla.  P. Dottie?  Who's P. Dottie?  Wait, what did you say?  P. what?  P. Dottie.  P. Dottie.  P. Dottie.  Oh, P. Dottie.  P. Dottie.  P. Dottie?  P. Dottie did rip off a little cashmere in the Godzilla song, I believe, right? 
[01:54:00]  Well, he sampled it.  I'm sure he paid to eat it.  No, he pretty much ripped them off.  Led Zeppelin?  Yeah, he ripped them off.  Yeah, well, yeah.  Ripping off Led Zeppelin.  We'll copy, too, but that's horrendous.  Yeah, I normally try to go against you guys, but this one is a tough one to win.  How did he have skated on fame for this fucking long and gotten as big as he has?  Biggie's flunky.  He produced Biggie.  He's flunky. 
[01:54:30]  What?  Produced him.  He produced Biggie.  He was that little dog that ran around fucking Biggie.  What are we going to do now today, boss?  What are we doing today, boss?  Eh, shit it.  Eh, shit it.  What are we doing today?  What are we doing today?  Shit it.  He's the little dog.  For more money, more problems.  Oh, fuck him.  If B.I.G. didn't die, we would not be...  Uh-uh.  We wouldn't know much about P. Daddy. 
[01:55:00]  P. Doty, you mean?  P. Doty.  I mean, you know, the Tories would get him a little something here and there, but...  He got that fucking tribute song, put him over the top, and that was it.  So no Sean John, no Siroc.  He's hosting those white fucking parties with Regis Philbin.  Really?  How did that happen?  Jesus.  No, his dumb clothing line, his dumb fragrances.  Ciroc.  His dumb songs, his dumb fucking appearances on award shows.  Right.  Oh, which one is this? 
[01:55:30]  Oh.  This, this...  I'll be missing you.  This is an original.  It's not an original.  Original.  What are you talking about?  A fucking police.  In Connecticut.  Ah, scary.  He has a little info on this song.  What's going on?  Wait, I can't hear ya.  Can you hear me now?  There we go.  Yeah, go ahead.  Sorry, sir.  Andy Summers, the guitar player from the police.  The first time he heard Puff Daddy's track, he heard it on his son's radio.  That's gotta be annoying.  I mean, I personally know that Sting's a dick. 
[01:56:00]  Right.  That's Sting being an asshole.  I personally know just from what he did to us one day, you could just, you could tell  a lot from just even meeting a person quickly.  Sting.  Oh, he was, he saw, Sting sold it behind his back.  He wrote that guitar line.  He wrote that, he wrote that part.  And that's the part that he took.  And that's the part.  Holy shit.  And he heard it on his son's radio.  He was so pissed off.  There's some sort of an article out there about it. 
[01:56:30]  You guys could look it up.  Oh, we gotta find it.  Do you think he dropped the N-bomb when he heard it?  I bet he did.  I completely believe you on this one.  Damn.  Oh, my God.  That's gotta piss you off.  Absolutely.  You hear, you fucking, do, do, do, do, do.  That's me.  Right.  It's my shit.  Wow.  It's not even someone playing it.  It's me.  Let me know if you find that, Sam.  Let's say hi to Chris on Long Island.  Chris.  Hey there, Chris. 
[01:57:00]  Hey.  I love a good Puff Daddy Beatdown.  There was a song that he did a bunch of years back called Been Around the World.  Oh, yeah.  He sampled not one, but two lily-white songs at the exact same time.  Did he sample two songs on it?  Two of the most lily-white songs at the exact same time.  Oh.  Been Around the World.  Well, I want to hear this now.  What?  What?  Sam.  No, I was talking to Travis.  Oh, okay.  Let's hear a little Been Around the World.  There's a lot of secrets during the show.  Yes.  It's all for you.  It's all secrets going on between the staff. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, Travis, Travis.  Oh, Sam.  Oh, it's Iraq.  Iraq, come here.  I don't get any of these secrets.  All I get is...  It's almost like we're producing a radio show.  Oh, we're doing our job.  All I get is Iraq's, hey.  Hey.  He tries to get my attention while we're live on the air.  But no one else hears it, so I sound like an idiot.  Because all of a sudden, in my headphones, I'll hear Iraq go, hey. 
[01:58:00]  So, obviously, I've got to go, what?  But I'm live.  Hey.  Yeah, so live on the air, you just sound like a nut.  What?  What?  I'm hearing voices.  Hey.  I get this.  30 seconds.  30 seconds.  30 seconds.  Stupid singer.  That's my secret.  But these guys are all, Sal, Sal.  Oh, Sal, Iraq, Iraq.  Roll it, roll it.  Look, I think you guys will admit.  With a Iraq, hey. 
[01:58:30]  Well, how do you, hey?  You can't answer a hey while you're doing a radio show.  Yes.  His instincts have never been the best.  But you guys do somewhat of a call-it-as-you-see-it radio show.  Sure.  So there's a lot of producing that goes on on the fly.  On the fly, as they call it.  And we like to make it seem seamless.  Oh.  That's been our secret, you know.  That is good.  Radio guys can't fucking do a radio show on the fly.  No, they can't.  I was talking about that the other day on the pre-show.  Wait, really?  Yeah, that you guys actually can come in here and just shoot the shit and nobody else can do that. 
[01:59:00]  It's kind of a scary way to live.  Like, I was thinking on the way in today, I've been on the, you know, I was lazy last night.  I'm like, holy fuck.  What are we going to do today?  What a hummin' hummin'.  And I know we have a great staff that prepares very well.  But we've just made all this shit up today.  Oh, yeah.  Every single bit of it.  That's what you do.  Yes.  You mean, you've got to be brave enough to do that.  And a lot of radio guys, they need everything, like, every fucking minute.  From 9 to 9 to 15, we have War of the Roses. 
[01:59:30]  Right.  War of the Roses.  Just throw the mics on and just sit.  That's it.  It's, sometimes you fucking fall flat on your fucking face.  It's part of the price.  So you're saying.  And now there's someone else.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  Yeah, right.  Sometimes.  So you're saying we didn't segment in a Puff Daddy beatdown today?  No.  Or a Jenny Hunt beatdown.  Yeah.  And see, that was, you guys would be like, why'd you call?  A Dr. Drew beatdown?  That wasn't on the docket. 
[02:00:00]  That wasn't on today's docket.  But Travis and me were communicating like ninjas in silence.  Nice.  To get Jenny Hunt on the phone.  That was good.  So she would just appear for you.  I do like that.  And then we make it sound like she was needy and called us.  Why'd you call?  I know.  You told me to call.  Oh, sorry.  No, someone called me from there.  Oh, okay.  Why'd you answer the call, you needy woman?  Just let it go unsaid.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  If you just hadn't mentioned that.  Everyone would have thought she'd just call. 
[02:00:30]  But you just have to.  I really want to rub it in, though.  Why'd you call?  I didn't.  You guys called me.  I'll be honest.  I didn't think she was smart enough to say I didn't call.  Oh.  That you guys called me.  She said it, though.  Damn, that's a big bitch.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  So, girl, she hasn't gotten any smaller, has she?  She's sitting on a couch, so, like, her thighs are getting all pushed up.  Oh, fuck.  It's even bigger, man.  It's like a blown-out pool toy.  Yeah.  Blown-out. 
[02:01:00]  You know what I mean?  Yes.  It just pushes out to one side.  Yeah.  Something's a mess.  Something's a mess.  They just will not listen to us at CNN.  It's too bad.  She's in the wrong spot on your dumb set.  You've got to put her in the background so she doesn't look so large.  In the back a little.  Some of that forced perspective.  Because Chris Cuomo used to work out at my gym before he became a big CNN star.  And that guy is huge.  He's at least 6'2", 6'3", at least 2'10", probably.  Wow.  And he looks tiny on that set. 
[02:01:30]  He does.  Because she is a big bitch.  He does.  So you push her to the back a little bit to balance everything out.  Yeah.  You know?  It's kind of like when you used to do the seesaw and you had to do it to Fat Kid.  You're like, oh, wait a minute.  And then you walked in the middle of it and adjust.  You had to readjust it.  Yeah, there were like three slots for the cheater totter.  They don't have those anymore.  No.  I go to the playground a lot.  I guess it was dangerous.  It was dangerous as fuck.  But you used to be able to balance out the weight.  Yeah.  The weight problem.  Like that, the monkey bars where you'd fall down and hit 20 things on the way down. 
[02:02:00]  It's like fucking just torture chambers.  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And remember how dangerous it was just to get your fingers caught in that seesaw thing when  you were trying to adjust it?  It was just on there with like a chain.  And you had to lift it up and go to the...  I'm amazed I have all my fingers from growing up.  Oh, God.  All the shit that could happen.  There were so many things to fuck up your fingers in.  Just smash your fingers.  Car doors.  Fucking garage doors.  Doors in your house.  You know, I'm still obsessed that I got a, you know, a seatbelt ticket. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  It's still bothering the shit out of me because the road, I got it on.  You can't even get up to 20 miles an hour because you can only go four blocks before  you hit a light.  Yeah.  And I'm so fucking pissed still that those assholes had to fucking make, give me a seatbelt.  And I was telling Chris on the way in today, he was filling in for Kenny.  I'm like, we're from a time where no seatbelts, no car seats, and no airbags.  Yeah.  And now they're giving you a fucking seatbelt ticket for going 20 miles an hour on a side 
[02:03:00]  road.  Yeah.  And now they want car seats for kids to have side protection also.  Right.  Like, it's got to do that.  It's smart.  All that shit's smart.  I heard that it will save five children a year.  Like, that was, it's some, it was some minuscule number, but they're like, well, we're going  to run out to this.  Wow.  But whatever.  You know, that's kind of a cool thing.  What's more dangerous than that is shopping carts.  It happened to us. 
[02:03:30]  We were lucky.  Really?  Yeah.  The kids are sitting in front of those shopping carts when you're in a supermarket and they  tilt over.  In the seat that's meant to be their seat?  Those are fucking extremely dangerous.  You've got to think.  The center of gravity goes over a little.  Yeah.  Over that one wheel.  I didn't know until I saw it tip over, you know.  But we were right there.  You caught it?  So, you know, I hear from the new parents all the time because I've become the poster.  Damn.  The poster child for fatherhood.  Fatherhood.  But that's one you've got to watch out for. 
[02:04:00]  That's a hell of a lawsuit right there.  Supposedly it happens a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, they're too skinny, the carts.  It's kind of creepy, but they do tip over.  Be careful with that shit.  Wait.  Do you go to those supermarkets, those city supermarkets where the thin aisles and the thin  little carts?  Um, no.  No?  No, ours, you definitely could get a full shopping cart.  I know what you're talking about.  Yeah, they got those, like, because in the city, space is a premium.  So they put these supermarkets with these aisles that are, like, two feet wide.  So they give you these shopping carts that are real skinny. 
[02:04:30]  There's a lot of supermarkets I can't go in because of that.  Yeah.  Yeah, man, with a stroller or whatever?  Fuck that.  There's a lot of places you just can't go.  I like a nice filthy bodega.  Nice.  I like a nice filthy bodega where, you know, you don't know how long the cereal's been sitting  there.  And it's all dirty and dusty.  A mangy cat walking around.  And then you're bringing some of that shit home and see the expiration date.  Yeah.  All those worms and shit.  Right.  What?  Oh, oh.  Where are we? 
[02:05:00]  Get us back on track, Sam.  Well, you wanted to hear Ben Around the World by Pump Daddy and Mix.  That was it.  Yeah.  Another just horrible fucking train wreck of a song.  That did very well.  This is a big song.  So mad that he is fucking as famous as he is.  He's the fucking man.  No, he's not.  What award show is he on recently where he knows everyone on stage going, hey, I saw you  on the yacht.  At the Golden Globes.  Right.  And he was just stealing all the attention for himself.  Like he interrupted the guy's Golden Globes speech to be like, we just partied on a yacht. 
[02:05:30]  Right.  Stop it.  He completely took the moment.  Yeah, it took the guy's moment.  And then, like, when the guy started talking, he's talking about his project that he just  won an award for.  Yeah.  And you see P. Diddy right behind him.  He's still, like, moving around and clapping and nodding like, yeah, the yacht.  Yeah.  I know this motherfucker.  He can't believe it's the same guy.  Right.  Oh, my God.  You're the guy from the yacht.  Yeah.  Oh, he rules.  Wow.  Here's a... 
[02:06:00]  You saw him coming from wherever, you're instantly into it.  You know it's Biggie.  He's got that big, fat sound coming out of him.  I can't name any fucking songs, but when you know a Biggie song...  But you like the beat, right?  It's just so right there, man.  That's P. Diddy.  No, I notice his rapping.  Oh.  It's just effortless.  Do you notice the little guy in the background going, take that, take that?  Oh, is that what he used to do?  That was all he had?  He would jump in the back and go, take that, take that. 
[02:06:30]  Another pilot fish.  Yeah.  We won't stop.  Diddy.  Indeed.  Charlie in Santa Cruz.  Charlie.  Charlie.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Hopi.  Do you think you could take that big bitch on CNN?  Do you think you could beat her up?  Oh, man.  She would be great for a night of fights.  Not only...  Mm-hmm.  Not only would I lose, she would pull my underpants up over my head.  That'd be embarrassing.  She is way too big.  I don't know how you fucking tackle that. 
[02:07:00]  Don't touch me.  Hockey stick.  Something.  You gotta have a weapon.  What are you doing?  Don't you don't touch me.  Get your hands up.  Grr.  Taser.  When the taser kicks in.  Instant compliance.  Sadly, I think she could take me there, sir.  Thanks, Charlie.  All right.  All right.  Why don't we break?  Yeah?  You think so?  Yeah, because we just had like just a sloppy break here. 
[02:07:30]  Oh, you know what that fucking...  We can get back on track with the Grammy Awards.  No, fuck the Grammys.  Who cares?  It's gonna be the basic winners.  No surprises.  Nothing fun's gonna happen there.  You know, I remember it was really dangerous growing up.  Things and...  Oh, poor Patty.  Poor Patty, indeed.  Will she be part of the Super Show, too?  I hope so.  I think so.  I like that she...  On the last Super Show, she was kind of a moral compass.  She stayed right on top of everybody, and that was refreshing. 
[02:08:00]  And we're gonna have different people at Super Show, too?  You gotta mix it up a little bit.  I'm trying to mix it up.  And it's definitely on the docket?  Yeah.  I mean, right now, it's still...  Unfortunately for Jim...  Two weeks from today, I think.  Yeah, let's say we're doing it on February 7th.  Nice.  Nice.  That is nice.  All right.  What were you...  Oh, I wanted to bring up a movie.  That movie I watched last night.  Yeah.  That fucking movie with...  What the hell is it?  Batman Forever?  No.  Lost Hope or something. 
[02:08:30]  Fried Green Tomatoes?  No.  What's his name?  It's on a boat, and the boat starts sinking.  Oh, the boat movie.  Captain Phillips.  No.  Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants?  That was...  No.  Let me see if I...  The Notebook?  No.  13 going on 30.  No.  Robert Redford.  Robert Redford?  Is it a new one?  Yes.  It's a new movie.  Is that the one that's good?  It's like...  Devil Wears Prada?  Lost Hope or...  All is Lost.  All is Lost. 
[02:09:00]  All is Lost with Robert Redford.  I think he's up for some awards, right?  Is he?  I don't know.  He's been in a few of these awards shows, so I would assume...  I was waiting for something to happen in this fucking movie.  He was supposed to...  Everybody thought he was going to happen.  I was eagerly awaiting for something to happen.  The beginning kind of drew me in.  What is it about?  He's on this sailboat.  Right.  It's not a big sailboat.  It's not a sailboat, and apparently he's this guy who has this... 
[02:09:30]  He likes sailing around the world or something.  He's going to sail around the world.  He's in the Indian Ocean somewhere, and he wakes up, and there's water coming in his  boat.  That's how it opens.  He's in the middle of the ocean.  It's like, what the fuck?  You know, there's a big hole in the side of his boat right at the water line.  So, like, when the boat kind of tips a little, water pours in.  So...  You can't fix that?  Well, that's just it.  But it happened right away, and it's a big hole.  Right.  So he gets up top, and there, in the middle of the ocean...  What did he hit in the middle of the ocean that made the hole? 
[02:10:00]  In the middle of the ocean, he gets out.  There's nothing around except one giant shipping container that must have fallen off a ship.  One of those big fucking cargo containers.  And the boat hit it, and that's what happened.  So it goes through the movie of him fixing the hole in the boat with fiberglass and things,  and it's just a shitty fix.  And his radio got wet, so now he's got no radio.  He's just trying to, like, get somewhere.  And then he hits a storm, and the hole fucks him up, and he hits his head on a thing, 
[02:10:30]  and he gets knocked out, and he wakes up, and the boat's now really full of water.  So he's got to get in a lifeboat.  There's no talking, this whole movie.  It's just him, and no words.  The only thing he says is,  Fuck!  At one point.  That's the only word in the whole movie.  It's a silent movie.  You watched the whole movie?  I watched the whole movie.  There's not one other person in it.  It's kind of like Castaway.  And not one word. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, but he talked.  He talked to Wilson.  Sure.  And he doesn't talk the entire movie.  So you don't even have a dialogue.  Is it really that that was the only word?  That was the only word he uttered, was fuck.  And because he was frustrated at that point.  And then it's a whole thing of him getting very desperate after like eight days goes by.  And the beginning starts with him writing a letter saying, you know,  Hope is lost.  Everything's lost.  I'm not making it.  It's done.  And that's him writing the note at the beginning.  And at the end, you know, the whole thing resolves. 
[02:11:30]  I'm not going to give away the beginning.  It's Hollywood.  He survives.  Of course.  Thank you.  Of course it's Hollywood.  You don't even, I don't even have to, I would bet, I would bet a million.  They, I wanted him to die so bad.  Of course he survives.  Just to give me something that was like, wow.  But it was just like a nothing movie.  It was really, I think they were trying to go for this, I don't know, this moody piece of film. 
[02:12:00]  But it just was dull.  It got dull.  And it just, the ending is just like, oh, of course that.  It happens.  Was it shot beautifully?  I can't even say it was shot beautifully.  No.  It really wasn't.  It was kind of just claustrophobic.  God, you, you're, I don't know.  I would have tapped out.  I wanted to, but I was waiting.  But you have a thing, too, if you start a movie.  I have to watch the whole thing.  If I start a movie, I gotta watch the whole fucking thing. 
[02:12:30]  Even if I'm literally angry at the movie.  Right.  I'm like, you suck, you fucking piece of shit movie.  Sounds awful.  I like when the credits start rolling on a movie.  My favorite movies is, you're watching it, and you're waiting, you're waiting, something  to happen, an explanation, that, that.  And then the screen goes dark a little, and then the credits start rolling.  I will out loud go, what?  Wait, what?  Right.  Are those credits, what?  Right.  That's just so frustrating.  And you're like, and then you're online. 
[02:13:00]  Right.  You're trying to, you may think maybe you're too stupid to figure out what it was.  Right.  So you're trying to get other people.  And those artistic people, they're like, that was wonderful.  The way they end.  And then there's 99% of the other people like, what the fuck was that?  Well, of course that means.  Yeah.  Does it?  Does it?  Yeah, exactly.  I don't like symbolism.  If it's supposed to be something.  Dude, you're alone, man.  All his loss is getting ridiculous reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.  I just saw that.  93% by the reviewers, 70% by the people. 
[02:13:30]  I guess as a depiction of a guy in a sinking boat, he did a great job.  But, I mean, the story itself.  It sounds like, it seems like the most dangerous thing you could do is try to go on a boat.  Alone.  Alone across an ocean.  And not like a ship.  It's a little boat.  It seems to never really work out.  No, and movies and stuff, like even documentaries, it never works.  Right.  It's always a problem.  Yeah.  The ocean's very big.  All right.  Yeah, so there's my review. 
[02:14:00]  I didn't like it.  93% of the critics like it and 70% of the people.  Yeah, but it's not the first time you've gone against the grain.  I think people felt they were supposed to like it.  That's a thing that happened.  Three Stooges.  You asshole.  He pops up the Three Stooges.  You actually liked the Three Stooges.  Dude.  He loved it.  I did not love it.  I said I laughed.  There were a few parts on the Three Stooges that I laughed at.  And there's been some movies that have gotten great reviews that I didn't laugh once at that  were comedies. 
[02:14:30]  So, the Three Stooges, the remake, I think it was cast very well.  I think the guys did a good job being Moe Larry and Curly.  49% of the people liked it.  And the slapstick didn't seem like, oh, they're just doing that.  I think it was a good depiction of the Three Stooges.  Is it one of those movies where they have to throw someone that's really big in pop culture?  Well, at the time, they incorporated in the Jersey Shore people.  They did, right?  Yeah.  So, all of a sudden, like, Snookies in there or something? 
[02:15:00]  It's so dated to watch it.  I hate when they fucking do that.  It's so dated to even watch it now.  You're just like, oh, Jersey Shore.  What's that?  That's just to try to pump up the numbers.  Right, at the time.  Because they have a big fan base.  So, let's just throw them in the movie.  They always look awkward and out of place.  And they're like, oh, why are you doing this?  They can't act.  So, it's like, what are you doing here?  Right, right.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, good stuff.  We're going to still talk about Governor Cuomo.  We're going to do the CNN reporter that gets pelted with snowballs. 
[02:15:30]  Governor Cuomo.  What about, is there outrage yet about that Sarah Silverman Jesus thing?  I don't know.  No?  Not really.  You want to explain after the break?  Yeah, yeah.  Because I'm not outraged by it or the message, because I could give a shit about abortion,  but I'm a little outraged at one aspect of it.  Oh, good.  We'll find out next.  Yeah, yeah.  Right on.  It was great.  Heading toward the weekend.  What?  We got the Sarah Silverman thing? 
[02:16:00]  Fucking Sarah Silverman.  Now, what is this about there, Anthony?  It's about Jesus.  Jesus.  Sarah Silverman's got this video thing where she talks about being visited by Jesus, and  then it gets acted out.  There's a guy playing Jesus in her apartment.  Okay.  And it's supposed to be this pro-choice piece.  Okay.  Now, using Jesus in a pro-choice piece might seem like there's a bit of a conflict there.  Right.  But, you know, the way they have it, I guess she says that Jesus would have loved abortions.  I don't know what her point is. 
[02:16:30]  I don't even care what her fucking point is on abortion, because I love abortions.  It's, hi, it's Heather B, yo.  I love Heather B.  Heather B.  She rules.  She's cool.  She's very cool.  Yeah.  And then, so I'm watching this, and like I said, abortions, I could give a shit.  Have as many as you want.  They should get them out free.  I love them.  I love abortions.  Oh, shit, man.  Oh, shit, we're being jacked.  By the TMZ star.  TMZ star.  There he is. 
[02:17:00]  Who kid?  DJ Who kid?  Look who's here.  It's Who Dad.  Who Dad's walked in.  You gotta lose that ski mask, man.  That is scary.  That scares white people.  White people are so scared of that mask.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm serious.  You know it's true.  You told TMZ that you were walking around robbing white people.  Because I just came out of your show.  Oh, that looks like.  And now you're wearing the mask, because that's the mask that was on TMZ.  Right.  I'm like, you know, I'm famous for.  That's a famous mask.  Famous for a fucking day.  I'm doing nigger right now, you know what I'm saying? 
[02:17:30]  Hey, I heard you say N-word.  You said N-word.  And by the way, you saying N-word offended me.  That is offensive.  That's what a lot of people are saying, but you know, I was trying to be real with you.  You know how to market yourself.  You know, if you say N-word, it'll go more places.  Right.  Cameras are rolling.  Although you could say thug now, I hear.  I hear thug is the new N-word.  Is it?  That's what they're saying on the news.  That's what we're learning.  Because they were talking about Sherman.  What's his name?  Richard Sherman.  Yeah, and they were saying that, you know, people call him a thug when meanwhile he's  not anything close to a thug. 
[02:18:00]  And then other people, especially MSNBC and whatnot, they start going like, oh, they're  using the word thug a lot on the, you know, some of these conservative people.  Is that the new N-word?  And Richard Sherman said that too.  Yeah.  He said, I think thug is the new N-word.  Well, let me tell you something.  Like Coke, New Coke and Coke Classic, I'll stick to Coke Classic.  I like the original.  Right.  So they got to tell me, like, white people on radio can't say the word thug now?  No, that's part of the...  I don't know, I guess.  They're saying, like, that we know, they're doing the, we know what you mean when you say 
[02:18:30]  thug.  Oh, hell no.  Ah, hell yes.  You can't come in and say, like, who kid came in here just acting like some thug.  Yeah, yeah.  It would be like, oh, I know.  You know what that means.  They mean nigga.  Right.  Get the fuck out of here.  He was late.  He ate all the chocolates.  Ah, like a thug.  Yeah.  You want some Stouffer's chocolate?  Right.  That's Stouffer's.  The stuffing people, they make chocolate now.  You got red velvet chocolate in there?  Hell no.  Look at that.  It's some shitty fucking chocolate.  This is ghetto chocolate.  It really is.  Is it thuggish?  It's thuggish, ruggish. 
[02:19:00]  Thug chocolate.  This is that CVS crap.  Yeah, that's the shit last minute.  You forget it's Valentine's Day and you got to grab that shit for the wife.  I don't want no chocolate on my mask because it's going to look kind of like...  No, that's true.  I don't want to eat shit.  Wait, you didn't even look at the chart?  You just went in cold and picked one?  That's crazy.  You can look at the chart.  This one looks kind of nice and soft and moist.  All right, try it out.  Oh, it's nutty.  What's inside there?  No, that's like cookie stuff in there.  Oh, it's nuts.  What is it?  Any good?  I think it's kind of nice. 
[02:19:30]  He likes it.  It's sexual.  That's it.  I'm horny now.  That's that CVS chocolate.  No, it's not CVS.  Look at the box.  Russell Stouffer.  Aren't you guys rich?  Why do you have CVS chocolate?  Exactly.  Because our sponsors don't understand.  They're fancy people.  It's for another...  We're fancy people.  It's from Dollar Shave Club.  They're very happy with the advertising on our show.  So they decide what better way than to send the guy shitty chocolate and dead flowers. 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, dead flowers.  Dead flowers from the company that we don't sponsor.  But there's mint in here.  There's a mint.  Oh, it's a minty.  Oh, a little minty.  You got one of the minty ones?  And some paprika.  That's good.  See, he figures he would like it because that's like a menthol chocolate.  Yeah.  Dogs love menthol.  It's mint.  It's like a menthol chocolate.  It's from my mouth.  You know what I'm saying?  My mouth smells like shit, too.  It does?  No, it just took care of that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  Is that a paprika in there?  Yeah.  It's the paprika.  That's nice.  I'm freaking that shit.  Do you guys agree that Bieber's on his way to being a black person? 
[02:20:30]  Hell no.  He's trying.  He's the laughingstock of the world.  You think so?  It was so obvious.  Oh, my God, yeah.  The only people that are hanging in there is his dumb little, you know, fan base.  His little girl fan base.  Everyone else thinks he's a loser.  He was trying.  If you read the transcripts of what the cops said, he said.  You're fucking with us, right?  No, I'm not.  No, he's trying.  I thought you guys were like fans of Bieber.  He's trying.  You really guys hate everybody, but I thought Bieber got a pass over there.  I think he is a loser. 
[02:21:00]  Oh, for real?  Read the transcripts of what he said to the cops when he got pulled over.  It's exactly what, like, a black guy would say.  It's like, why the fuck?  He's like, why the fuck are you pulling me over?  What the fuck is this all about?  You know, that's like black guy getting pulled over shit.  Like real black guys.  He should have just been, oh, officer, what's up?  And the officer would have been, oh, you're a white guy.  Let me speak in a language you understand.  He's fronting, yo.  Get the fuck out of here.  He's fronting, yo.  There's no realness to this shit.  He's got to be 100.  No.  That's right. 
[02:21:30]  He's not real?  Hell no.  He's not keeping it real.  Hell no.  You're saying it again, people.  You're saying it again.  I'm like Search.  I'm like motherfucking MC Search.  I mean, I saw Seth Rogen and called him a piece of shit.  I saw that.  That would rule.  That's why Seth Rogen has a lot to lose, and that's why he fucking rules.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he had no problem tweeting that.  Because he tweeted what everyone thinks.  He is just a piece of shit.  Yeah, but Justin Bieber toured with Jesus Christ.  He had 200,000 people in front of him worldwide, everywhere he toured. 
[02:22:00]  Good for him.  Why are you hanging with loser rappers?  Right, because it's going away.  Because he wants to be a fucking loser rapper.  He wants to be one of the guys.  I think he's the fat chick hanging with the, you know, you ever see like the pretty chick  that hangs with the fat chicks?  Oh, yeah.  I think he wants everybody to be so low around him, and he'd still be like the nigga.  Right, he could be the big guy.  Right, he could be the head fucking guy.  To get his cred up, he's going to have to shoot somebody.  He's going to have to.  Because he's either going to have to take one, or he's going to have to fucking give 
[02:22:30]  one.  Yeah.  Because he's a joke.  He's a fucking loser joke.  He'll wind up getting shot in the ass.  I'm like so fucking, I'm in shock and awe that you guys are like calling Bieber a loser.  Oh, he's an asshole.  You thought they were Beliebers the whole time?  No, I thought you guys were Beliebers.  Yeah.  I'm a Belieber.  You don't like Bieber?  You look like Bieber.  Oh, shit.  I appreciate that.  I look like a black version of Bieber.  Yeah.  No, I'm not a Justin Bieber fan at all.  I'm with Opie. 
[02:23:00]  He's a loser.  He does that wigger talk when he's talking.  It's like, yo, let me tell you.  It doesn't matter how much money you have and fame, he's a loser to everybody.  You can't buy swag.  Nah.  People laugh at that kid when he walks by now.  Unless you're 14 years old.  Are there any cool black people that would hang out with Lil' Zah?  Probably like Nick Cannon.  Exactly.  Oh, shit.  Nick Cannon's a loser.  Oh, no.  Nick Cannon's my boy.  That's a good friend.  Nick Cannon.  That's Sam's good friend right there. 
[02:23:30]  He's a fronter, too.  No, he's my boy.  Oh, shut up.  I love Nick Cannon.  Go work with Nick Cannon.  Everyone loves Nick Cannon.  Go have fun with Nick Cannon.  What's Nick Cannon ever done?  Oh, my man.  They kind of got his mask on.  Gangster.  What did you say, Sam, about Nick Cannon?  I said he's my boy.  He's a man.  Because he had a good interview with him once.  Who cares?  Give a fuck about Nick Cannon.  We have a relationship.  Prime time.  Nick Cannon is a goofball.  He's a little bit of a goofball.  He's a little goofy.  That's a white thing.  Sorry. 
[02:24:00]  I don't think you guys call people goofballs.  He came in here with Swarovski crystal shoes last time I talked to him.  Exactly.  He's a goofball.  No way.  He's the Reverend Dressie Jackson.  Oh, shit.  Is he a fashionista?  He's a bit of a fashionista.  Oh, damn.  I'll say he's a knucklehead.  He's a guy.  Is he officially a knucklehead?  Yeah.  But what's crazy is there's no way Justin Bieber did not talk to Jesus Christ.  It's impossible.  Yeah?  He has the glow.  You know what I'm saying?  You think?  He performed in front of, like, 10 million people. 
[02:24:30]  He's the guy.  Yeah.  The chosen one.  He had a good run.  Somebody in Somalia know who Justin Bieber is.  Yep.  He's panicking.  I know he's got an hour out that's doing pretty well, but he's panicking.  He knows, uh, you know, the shelf life is not over.  Famous fleeting.  Famous fleeting, and he's trying to hold on to it by being, like, a gangster.  You guys weren't, like, you weren't impressed when he had sex with that Brazilian chick or  whatever?  Well, you know.  No.  She did say he was packing.  Yeah, he said she knew that Bieber had a big cock.  I wonder how much she was paid to say that.  I'm not impressed, because we probably shouldn't know. 
[02:25:00]  Like, he's trying to push all this shit out there.  Uh-huh.  Because he's so insecure.  That's what he's doing.  I mean, he probably, his people, Scooter or whoever he hangs out with, probably just  said, look, now that this is out there, you Brazilian prostitute, you gotta make a video  that says he had a big dick.  He had a big dick.  Of course.  And then you need some fucking black guys over your house to be arrested with drugs.  Right.  And then you need to fucking get a deewee, and then you need to resist an arrest like a black  guy.  No, curse at the officer.  Curse at him like a black guy.  You know who the real Justin Bieber is?  Is the kid that egged that house. 
[02:25:30]  Right.  That's the only real thing he's done.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's the only real thing.  Everything else is forced over the top.  Like, I think this is what I should do to be Topher.  Holy fuck.  That thing, every time it pops up on the news, scares the living shit out of me.  Oh, that mechanical, like, cow-looking thing?  The thing that runs?  Yeah, what is it again?  A cow transformer.  Yeah.  It looks like a robot.  It's a robot, like, what kind of animal is it?  But it can run.  It's like a horse-cow thing. 
[02:26:00]  Rhino thing.  Rhino, yeah.  That thing scares the shit out of me.  Yeah.  The Nagelbot 2014.  It looks scary, too, man.  What the fuck was that?  O&A, they've said they're banning all Justin Bieber records from the channel until he gets  help.  Until he gets help and goes into rehab.  You know, we're trying to help.  On the entire SiriusXM platform.  Yeah, so don't play any.  Get the fuck out of here.  Ban Bieber.  Hashtag SiriusXM.  No baby, baby?  Okay, maybe that one. 
[02:26:30]  Baby, baby.  So what's up with Sarah Silverman?  Oh, yeah.  So she does this thing where she's visited by Jesus, and she's talking about abortion and  saying that, you know, that apparently Jesus likes abortion.  I don't know.  But, like, this, it's not courageous.  It's not brave.  It's not anything.  If she wants to be brave, depict Muhammad, right?  And he comes to visit, and you talk to him about violence against women in Muslim countries 
[02:27:00]  and the Muslim religion.  Then, while you're getting your head sawn off by some Muslim that didn't like you're depicting  their Lord, then you could be a brave martyr for your cause.  But to then goof and use the symbol of Christianity, Jesus Christ, in an ad for abortions, and  to sit there and have fun, like, joking with Jesus and stuff.  Like I said, I personally don't care what the message is. 
[02:27:30]  I just hate that, of course, again, it's Christianity that can be fucking fucked up the ass.  What if she went after the Black Jesus?  Black Jesus, like on Good Times, where...  Yeah.  Where...  That'd be a little edgier.  The J.J. painted Black Jesus.  That'd be edgier if you go after the Black Jesus.  We all know there's a Black Jesus out there.  And it was the wino downstairs that he painted, and...  That would be disgraceful, though.  You know what I'm saying?  Black Jesus?  Or Black Santa.  Black Santa.  Either or, it'd still be disgraceful.  Yeah. 
[02:28:00]  Dude, that fucking ski mask is fucking...  That's fucking the one you see on closed circuit.  Holy shit, man.  Fucking security cams right there.  And he's got his hoodie up, too.  Oh, my God.  And the news would say, he was seen in a mask and a gray hoodie.  Oh, my God.  That would be the description.  Holy shit.  He's a male in a mask with a hoodie on.  What's not...  You're gonna tell me if I'm walking my dog 6 a.m. in your neighborhood, you wouldn't walk  by and act like nothing's going on?  I would walk by, but I would definitely have my hand on my hip. 
[02:28:30]  I thought I was normal today.  I came up here.  Damn.  I would absolutely call the cops and have them take a look.  Can you go take a look?  You must have fucking left just a bunch of old white ladies with twisted ankles in your  wake today, trying to get the quickest to get away from you.  Yeah.  That's actually this last thing.  Who Kid's Mask is scary enough that you ignore the fact that he's got purple dolphins on  his hoodie.  Yeah, it's adorable.  Yeah.  I know.  That's a weird contrast.  You forget it, because the mask is terrifying. 
[02:29:00]  That is not a B&E hoodie.  That is a peaceful, fun little hoodie.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm trying to be non-confrontational with this mask.  That's not gonna work.  You know what I'm saying?  It's like, you know, if Nick Cannon came in, I know I scared him.  Like, honestly, when you said you had sex in that mask last night, none of us here thought  that was voluntary sex.  That's what that mask looks like.  You should go down the hall.  You could get a raise with that mask.  Oh, man.  I just saw a bladder, and he just gave me, like, a check.  I was like, oh, what are you doing?  I said, you know, I could wait in the mail for it.  He just gave me my check.  Wow. 
[02:29:30]  He just handed over money.  His wallet.  Everything.  So, Sarah Silverman, that's it?  All you got?  Is this a quick bit, or what?  No, it goes on and on.  It goes on and on.  But you know, you start up a little.  No, I don't have time to be bored by Sarah Silverman.  Oh, but she's so cool.  She's so hip and cool.  She's funny, right?  Fuck her.  I don't know.  She's super funny.  She got nice tits.  I don't know if she is.  Black people love her.  I think she's...  Did you see her naked in that movie with her big, hairy fucking bush? 
[02:30:00]  I did.  And her wide hips?  I think she gained weight for that role.  Snatched.  And fucking didn't shave her.  Ah, puss-ah.  Ah, puss-ah.  Ah, puss-ah.  Is it in or is it in now to let it grow back out?  Yeah, it's making a comeback.  You know what it is?  It's coiffed, though.  Like they're trimming it, but they're letting it grow in a little bit.  And I think before we know it, full-on pussies will be back again.  From hip to hip?  Fucking hip to the navel.  From hip to the navel?  Yeah.  All the way around to the asshole?  Pubic hair bikini. 
[02:30:30]  Give it to...  I have not seen hair on an asshole in years.  Oh, man.  I'm disgusted.  They try keeping that hair away from the asshole.  We're humans.  But, uh...  You know what?  You don't want hair on an asshole.  Don't you want to see a fucking bush, though?  Every so often?  I thought dicks get hard when dicks see hair.  Because they have their own eyes.  Yeah, they sniff it out.  You know your dick got an eye.  It's like an internal eye.  It's got the single eye.  Oh, like a fucking...  You mean like a zen eye, right? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  But it senses like pubes.  No.  The pubic hair is dead.  It's supposed to tinkle your shit.  Tinkle.  Your shit go...  Yeah, pubes let you know.  Pubes are like the exit and entrance sign over a doorway.  You know it's there.  You don't want to get lost.  Because right now, there's billions of pedophiles.  Because once you take the hair off, it's like you're fucking a baby.  Oh, man.  Think about it.  You don't fuck girls with shaved pussies?  Hell no.  Not in Europe, nigga.  I would think a lot of the chicks...  Dirty pussy. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, yeah?  I love that shit.  You do?  Yeah, there's medication for that shit.  Okay, you're right.  Nothing better than when you used to have to use your fingers to pry the hairs apart like  a Venus flytrap.  You don't have to open it up, a Venus flytrap.  It's just fucking all together.  Some of the hair stuck on the other side.  On the other side, right?  It's like fucking locked.  It's like one of those fucking doors in a science fiction movie with teeth on it and shit.  That's why I ask my wife every morning. 
[02:32:00]  You all right?  Yeah.  If she's all right, then I'm good.  It's like unlacing a shoe.  You have to unlace the fucking hair, exactly.  This shit is hot as fuck.  There it is.  Wow, you're sweating bad.  Yeah, that is fucking hot.  I'm a wet pussy right now.  Man, damn.  That's why those robberies got to go down fast.  Fucking people would be sweating.  I figured it out, man.  Yeah.  You want to hear...  Did you hear about what's going on in India? 
[02:32:30]  Oh, that...  What now?  The 20-car, the 40-car pileup?  They're hairy, too, those Indian girls.  Or the rapes.  The go-and...  Yeah.  The go-and-enjoy-yourself story?  That shit is crazy.  Actually, go and enjoy yourselves.  That's hot.  That's what a tribal elder said before.  Indian gang-rape victim was tied to a platform to be assaulted in view of the entire village  because of an affair...  What'd she do?  ...with a Muslim.  Uh-oh.  Some religious shit.  The 20-year-old Indian woman was gang-raped.  This was her punishment. 
[02:33:00]  Wow.  It was gang-raped by 13 men.  That's a voice right there.  It was sexually assaulted while tied to a raised bamboo platform so her entire village  could watch the torture and emerge.  The head of the village, who led the kangaroo court, which sentenced the woman to the savage  rape as punishment for her falling in love with a man from another village.  Is this the latest Richard Gere movie?  This is crazy.  I forgot about that.  Yeah.  It's crazy. 
[02:33:30]  Did they use protection?  What is this?  Is this a Diane Lane, Richard Gere movie?  Is this a Julia Roberts vehicle?  I think it's a Julia vehicle.  It's a Julia Roberts vehicle.  It's going to be a Julia Roberts vehicle.  Yeah.  What is this?  She goes over there to find herself.  But they get back together in the end, right?  And she finds her...  They do get back together.  It was previously reported that she had been raped repeatedly in a hut, but today it emerged  that she had been publicly humiliated on a platform set up close to the village's headman's hut.  Someone's saying, oh, it's Hudson here, 666 is saying, it was from the movie Eat, Pray, Love, Rape. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, okay.  Oh, all right.  Yeah, I think that's...  I didn't watch the end of that one.  Yeah, the rape part.  I saw Eat, Pray, and then the love part.  And then I got bored, yeah.  I turned it off before Rape.  Or was the rape part like where they sneak in another scene after the credits and you  already left the theater?  Yeah.  Maybe that was it.  Sisterhood of the Traveling Rapes.  Yeah, that one.  You know, it was something like that.  Oh, boy.  That's some vicious shit.  That's Indian people? 
[02:34:30]  Damn.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot of rape stories come out of India.  Yeah.  A lot of rape.  Wasn't there one where a ferry was sinking and the guys figured there was a good time to maybe  get one last rape in?  That was...  Find that story.  Sounds like one of Anthony's dreams.  No, I think we talked about it.  That was George Clooney and Penelope Cruz.  Oh, okay.  Yes.  No, I'm serious.  I think it's a real story.  As the woman remained in intensive care today, further horrific details of the gang rape  punishment emerge.  But I think they rounded up these guys because finally someone came to their senses and said, 
[02:35:00]  what the fuck?  I always take these international stories, though, and cut any fact in half, at least.  Really?  Like, oh, ten guys raped her.  All right, fine.  Because there's a language barrier.  And they pump up the story once it gets to the States.  Usually it goes to the UK first.  That mirror they got over there is just a lie rag.  Right.  Get out of here.  They just print fake shit and that anyway.  Those English, they don't care about real news.  No.  And then by the time it makes it over here, it's been so fucking perverted. 
[02:35:30]  Watered out, dude.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, there's ten people and she was raped on a platform in front of the town.  It was probably like, you know, a menage a trois with an open window next to like a fucking  factory.  Degrading.  Yeah, yeah.  Degrading, but not, you know, gang raped.  You're trying to...  By the way, Florentine was also caught by TMZ.  Oh.  Yeah.  Florentine was raped.  TMZ Sports got him.  They did.  Yes.  Ah, Florentine.  By the way, you know that Justin Bieber was only going 60 miles an hour as he's... 
[02:36:00]  In a drag race.  In a Lamborghini.  In a drag race with a Lamborghini.  Yeah.  He was going 60 miles an hour.  Boy, he's fucking edgy.  That's great.  He's fast.  Get out of here.  I know, right?  In a Lamborghini.  Lambo and he's fucking doing 50 miles an hour.  Which he only rented, by the way.  What was he smoking?  What drug was he using?  A little marijuana.  They said he had prescription pills too, right?  Yeah, whatever.  All those Zanis.  Here's Florentine.  Isn't this right by here?  I haven't seen this yet. 
[02:36:30]  Some Zanis?  All right, buddy.  How you doing, man?  Good to see you, buddy.  Freezing my balls off.  Ah, dude.  Freezing my balls off.  Dude, Justin Bieber.  Dayton, he was in...  What do you think about this whole Justin Bieber?  He got arrested, DUI?  Yeah, now he was...  The girl that was in the car with him was Deshaun Jackson's ex-girlfriend?  Yes, Deshaun Jackson's ex-girlfriend.  From the Eagles.  From the Eagles.  Wide receiver.  How does that girl go from Deshaun Jackson to Justin Bieber?  You know what I mean?  And, like, look, Deshaun Jackson, you know,  NFL player, I'm sure his private parts, being black, they're probably pretty big. 
[02:37:00]  We go to Justin Bieber, and any guy...  And he was in a Lamborghini.  Any guy in a Lamborghini we know is lacking in that department that's wider in the Lamborghini.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so why would you go with that?  But, hey, look, I don't mean to brag.  He's like, I got to throw it at her cell, so...  There you go.  But, yeah, no, it's ridiculous.  That girl's got some low self-esteem issues to go from Deshaun Jackson to Justin Bieber.  Totally, man.  Do you think, I mean...  Who's next?  One Direction?  Do you think Deshaun Jackson should be pissed at all for, you know, for Justin going after, you know, 
[02:37:30]  trying to go after his ex-girlfriend?  Or did he seem nervous?  No, I think Deshaun Jackson is laughing.  He's like, ah, because I dumped her.  Look who she's with now.  Yeah.  Some little, yeah, some little kid, little punk.  So, no, he's laughing about it right now.  I bet you his friends are trying to bust his balls.  Like, oh, can you believe what your ex did?  He's like, yeah, whatever.  Who cares?  Because you always want your ex to go with somebody worse than you.  Yeah, that's true.  You don't want a better...  Like, she was in a car with Tom Cruise.  Then Deshaun would go, damn, or Brad Pitt or somebody like that. 
[02:38:00]  That's true.  Do you think people, you know, when Deshaun starts playing football games,  do you think people would come after him and taunting to him,  saying, oh, you know, that's where it grows with Justin Bieber?  You know, is that good trash talk?  Yeah, I would.  Like, if I was lying up against Deshaun Jackson, I'm like,  hey, Deshaun, you got some Bieber fever?  Because I do, and so does your ex-girlfriend.  He's going to be on the show next week.  He's hilarious.  Holy shit.  I like how he's like, NFL player.  And then he had to say it, you know, being a black guy. 
[02:38:30]  You got to have a big cock on him.  So he actually proved that Bieber got a small cock then.  Yeah.  That's Jim's theory.  Yeah, Jim's theory.  So the Brazilian was lying about his cock?  She probably got paid off to say he had a huge hog.  Yeah, I believe she was lying.  Yeah, I think.  I believe she got coerced into saying that.  I think all signs point to he has a micro penis.  It's micro even.  Oh, yeah.  Micro penis.  You want to see a micro penis?  Have you ever seen a micro penis? 
[02:39:00]  I mean, no.  Pull your pants down.  Come on, Sam.  I'll show you.  What's that micro penis?  No, Sam.  You got to look close.  Not because my dick was normal.  There's a micro penis.  Oh, damn.  That's embarrassing.  That's really real.  That's my Facebook page.  That's embarrassing.  You're not going to be able to get any mushroom stamping done with a micro penis.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Look at that.  Holding it between the thumb and forefinger very gaintily.  Why is it like balls?  Like, what is these balls?  I don't know.  Wow.  Penis part is micro.  You don't want them. 
[02:39:30]  That's God's curse right there.  Giving a guy a micro penis.  That's his pediatric textbook.  What are you doing?  Oh, my God.  He looks like an Audi.  What is that?  God damn.  Would you even go to a bar if you had a micro penis?  No.  No.  You go to the fucking gun closet and blow your head off.  That's what you do.  Just end it.  How do you get a head?  It looks like the end of a garlic knot.  Dude, that looks like a clit and overinflated labia with, like, fucking...  That's not a...  A deflated balloon. 
[02:40:00]  That last minute was like, all right, you're a guy.  Oh, fuck.  We don't have enough time to cook the junk.  It still looks like a chick.  Anyway, yeah.  Wow, that's terrible.  Quickly, Governor Cuomo plans to ban use of welfare cards at liquor stores, casinos, and  strip clubs.  Now, why...  Fuck that for kidding.  That's fucked up.  A black part of me just like, oh, shit.  You got to stick up for your periods right now.  Why were they allowed there in the first place? 
[02:40:30]  I think the rules got a little lax.  Do you think they got a little lax?  Governor Cuomo's like, we got to calm the fuck down.  Start controlling this a little better.  You know, it's supposed to be there to feed your kids, keep your, you know, keep your health  there, and...  Well, so you don't starve.  Well, they want the public assistance to be used as intended.  Right.  To ensure the least fortunate among us are able to access food and shelter and heat. 
[02:41:00]  That's it.  So what if the strip club serves wings?  Exactly, man.  Well, you should still be able to get some wings, right?  You can't let a nigga flip something, man.  Go to the casino.  Flip the money.  Flip the money.  So you take that, you make more money.  Exactly.  Now you're getting...  I don't think it's fair that it looks like a credit card DJ here, kid.  I know.  There's no more shame at the supermarket.  What happened to the shame part?  Where you see someone breaking those actual stamps and food stamps. 
[02:41:30]  I haven't been pouring in a long time.  I'm going to pay for this in food stamps.  And now it's a card.  It was embarrassing.  Now you're just swiping a card like you're living large.  It's like, here's my visa.  Here's my visa, nigga.  Swipe this bitch.  That looks just as good as my Amex.  Right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What the fuck?  Why did I work so hard for an Amex when I could have a fucking...  Yep.  I ain't going to front.  That shit did look embarrassing when Swerve is ahead of me.  Pull that shit out.  Oh, man.  You can pull a motherfucker.  You used to pull that out and they're fucking pegging with Monopoly money. 
[02:42:00]  Bananas, motherfucker.  You want me to buy you this fucking pack of bananas, nigga?  I'm like, yo, why are you using this for bananas?  Save your stamps for the strip club.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What are you doing here, man?  Save your stamps for the strip club.  That's why you can't really argue Cuomo because the only argument...  Because they say, well, why should the government be paying you to go to a strip club?  Yeah.  And the only possible argument is, I like the strip club.  Right.  That's the only argument.  There's no nutritional value on the strip club. 
[02:42:30]  I mean, yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Some of that pussy.  Yeah, a lot of meat hanging out of it.  It's a biology class.  Yeah, yeah.  For junior.  Well, there's a lot of single mothers in strip clubs if you look at it like that.  Pay it forward.  They all got eight babies each.  They're stripping with their stomachs.  I don't know that.  With the fake money that they used to give you, a lot of people were, you know, selling  it.  So they would, like, give you $10 in food stamps for $5 cash so then they could use  the cash to buy dope or whatever the fuck else they wanted to buy. 
[02:43:00]  Booze, shit you couldn't use the food stamps on.  So they went to the EBT cards.  And now, you know, I guess people are using that, too.  They're just buying other people's shit.  You know, buy me that shit.  Some real poor shit right there.  Yeah.  Is that the spots where you can use EBT in an ATM?  Yeah.  And so it's like, you just pull cash out.  No.  You pull the cash out of that fucking thing.  Are you serious?  I think so, man.  No, that doesn't seem right either.  I don't give a fuck.  And how do you use it at a casino?  Who the fuck is fucking gambling with their EBT card? 
[02:43:30]  That's great.  I would assume a lot of people.  Yeah, hit me, motherfuckers.  I got some EBT on my...  Yeah.  Another $50?  Yeah.  Give me your EBT card.  Don't eat bananas on number eight.  He's praying as bananas.  Yeah, I want to put this baloney in American on fucking 20.  23.  I got $10 in cold cuts.  Yeah.  It's a fucking...  You know, it's like one of those lines where you supposed to have like 10 items or less.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[02:44:00]  It's fucking taking forever to pay with these stamps, motherfucker.  Yeah, I'm going to double down with these saltine crackers.  Yeah.  Can I do that?  By the way...  I'm going to double down on my fucking 11 with some Ritz crackers and some Velveeta.  I got three cans of ginger ale.  Ginger ale.  You know what?  Give me 23 black and I'm betting three grape sodas on the motherfucker. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, I'm a bit uncomfortable that DJ Hookin would use bananas as an example.  That's great.  I want to just say that for the record.  Oh, my God.  Out of any fruit you're going to pick, they had to go with bananas.  It's a fucking nutritious fruit for people and it's definitely available with the EBT card.  The joke was more about potassium than anything else.  Can we see the CNN reporter before we get out of here?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hookin will enjoy this. 
[02:45:00]  We're doing our Hookin material.  Did you see this clip?  Special Hookin material.  Yes, I did.  So great.  I guess to prove it was cold outside, Anderson Cooper sent this reporter out to a college  where they were having a big snowball fight.  And so like halfway through the clip, the whole crowd turns on.  Damn.  And the cameraman.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  This is what should happen.  Yeah, exactly.  Around the day, a lot of snowball.  A lot of kids up there at Columbia University. 
[02:45:30]  For them, this must be a lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  Yeah, let me give you a look around here so you can see what's happening.  Tawana, I wanted to give you a little shot here.  This is what they do every single time.  Anderson, there's a huge snowstorm.  They end up having a snowball fight.  Oh, shit.  Holy shit.  Oh, they're nailing him.  I hate him, too.  Oh, they're fucking nailing him.  Good for him.  Oh, this is racist.  I love it.  Just nailing him right in the face.  Every year, you guys come out here and do this. 
[02:46:00]  Shut up.  Oh.  Yeah.  I love it.  Is it worth it all?  Give us a second to talk.  And the guy still has to try to do a report.  Yeah.  That's the favorite part.  Oh, my God.  He's trying to report.  He's getting hit in the face.  And he looks to the crowd.  He goes, hey, guys, give us a second to talk.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  That usually works.  That'll work.  That works out perfect.  Anderson's laughing because he knows what it's like getting hit in the face with balls,  too.  He's just back in the studio.  He enjoys a good snowball.  Oh, he loves a good snowball.  Yeah. 
[02:46:30]  Good snowball.  Getting a face full of white stuff.  Yeah.  Why?  I'd like to.  What are you going to do?  He still enjoys penis.  That's not an insult.  Let's be real here.  Let's go.  Yeah.  He got it in his face, too.  Oh, he did.  Oh, it gets way worse.  It's the worst of coming out.  It gets worse.  Yeah.  I hate it.  They are not stopping.  Look at how wet his face is for snowballs.  Yes.  I know.  This is the city that never...  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  He's lucky this snow doesn't make good snowballs.  Oh, shit. 
[02:47:00]  They're hitting it with point-blank trains.  Like, they're running up and just smashing them.  They're throwing snow out of them.  Actually, if you take a look around here, you can see hundreds of students have actually...  There's people, like, doing lay-ups into his face now.  They're just picking up piles of snow and throwing it at the camera.  At Columbia University.  Anderson Cooper's laughing.  As you can see down here, it's light.  It's fluffy.  He's actually trying to retaliate.  But they're trying.  And they're doing a pretty good job.  Oh, shit. 
[02:47:30]  They killed him.  I can't even know what that was.  Oh, did they nail him.  Bombarded.  He just said he was light and fluffy.  That was good.  Yeah.  They don't like blacks up near Columbia.  Wow.  They killed him.  As long as you're not on campus, they don't care.  Right.  They showed him no respect, man.  None.  None.  He's like a real reporter, right?  Dude, somebody went right up to his face while he was trying to do his outro.  Right.  He just went right up and, like, pie-faced him with a snowball. 
[02:48:00]  He just moved the snow right into his face.  As if to say, fuck you.  What are you going to do about it?  Yeah, that was me that threw that.  Yeah.  What are they doing in Columbia?  I didn't know that.  Right.  Reporting live from a snowball.  Oh, no.  Like, how did nobody see that coming?  I didn't know they do that at that college.  Are you serious?  I didn't know either, but that guy knows now.  I thought the suicide rate was serious there.  But they actually had to fight for a snowball fight.  A snowball fight before they throw themselves off of the roof of one of the buildings.  Yeah, people kill themselves because they get bullied like that news reporter.  Right, right. 
[02:48:30]  That guy's going to kill himself.  The buildings aren't high enough up there.  That's the problem.  So they have a lot of broken ankles.  Oh.  Yeah.  Survivors, huh?  Oh, it's the NYU kids.  They're all in.  Oh, yeah.  Fucked up kneecaps.  Jesus.  They need fucking circus fucking mats around those.  Yeah.  Around the dorms down there.  Why do they kill themselves?  Because, you know, we don't care about education.  Because you got the B-press.  You've got to climb up to the roof and kill yourself.  You've fucking disappointed your parents.  That's crazy. 
[02:49:00]  No one has ever asked me about my college education.  Yeah, look at the fuck.  Not once.  They assume you don't have one.  I can't help my kids with his homework.  No.  I'd be like, nigga, get out of here.  You've got a smart kid, too, right?  My kid's like a genius, and I'm stupid as fuck.  He was telling me at a party.  That's stupid as fuck doing all right.  DJ Who kid was telling me at a party that one of his kids is actually a genius.  Really?  Super genius.  In what?  Like he does, like, formulas and all this nuclear shit.  Oh, man.  And he's only, like, in sixth grade.  He does 11th grade work. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, but who gets doing whatever he can to make sure he has an ignorant son?  He's trying to get that intelligence out of him.  Yeah, man.  Trying to ignat him up a little bit.  Like a couple months ago, he posted on Instagram.  He sent him to school in a t-shirt that said Trap Lord on it, which is slang for crack dealer.  What are you doing, man?  And his little genius son.  Oh, man.  I wonder why the teacher wanted to talk to me, but I don't answer my phone call.  You're trying to even that shit out?  Can you tell the story you told me at the party? 
[02:50:00]  I don't know.  I don't know how far you want to go.  I want fucking someone all that knowledge and shit.  What story did I do?  Trap Lord?  Trap Lord.  Oh, it's up to you.  I don't know where your wine is when you get it.  Which blowjob was I getting?  I don't know.  Your wife wanted you to talk to your son about an incident?  Oh, yeah.  My son is on his Facebook.  Some young chick wanted to give him a head.  I was like, yeah.  Whoa.  But then my wife was like telling me to tell him not to get his dick sucked. 
[02:50:30]  What?  That's crazy.  Get him get his dick sucked.  As long as he gets straight A's, I don't care.  Right?  That cock.  I said, I'm not talking to him about that because he's a boy.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  So I'm going to leave that.  I'll fuck with the drugs because, you know, he got caught, like, but it was a curiosity thing.  He got caught, smoking weed or whatever.  But I was like, fuck it.  You know what I'm saying?  Sixth grade?  Yeah, we got him out of there.  He said he was curious.  Oh, man.  He had to be cool or whatever.  He goes, fuck.  He goes, okay, you're done with drugs. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, it's just experimenting.  I think, okay, well, help yourself to this drug paraphernalia, crack dealer, t-shirt, wear it all you want.  And get yourself a blowjob while you're at it.  I mean, that's how the blowjob thing came into play because I had to get his password to his Facebook.  So I had to figure out where he was getting it from.  You know, they get the drug.  These kids get drugs from, like, the dealers in the Facebooks now.  Wow.  They gave me, I was like, you're the stupidest motherfucker on the planet.  Wow.  So I was going through the fucking notes and all the info.  And then I saw, like, a chick, like, a little Mexican girl. 
[02:51:30]  I wanted to suck his cock at the park.  Wow.  And then I was like, should I call the parrot and be like, yo, get your daughter's mouth off.  Don't be a cock blocker.  Cock block your son like that?  Nah, he probably got his dick sucks.  You think so?  Yeah.  I get my dick suck every week.  Why am I going to tell my son not to?  I get my dick suck.  I got my dick suck last night when I was in the basketball.  I learned it from you, okay?  Say what you want.  Your kid is not a hypocrite.  No, no.  He's extremely smart.  He's actually smarter than me and probably all of his idiots. 
[02:52:00]  So I don't know.  Well, the second you see that go down the shitter, you'll know what he's smoking pot against.  So the second you start smoking weed.  As soon as he gets that first bid, you're like, ah, shit.  It doesn't help if I hang with Snoop Dogg or I hang with fucking, you know, Willie Nelson.  That's true.  He's fucked up.  Like, I hang with Willie Nelson.  He's going to tell me, you hang with Willie Nelson.  I can't smoke weed, motherfucker.  Yeah, yeah.  Better get him to stop cursing, too.  We're out of here.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sure you two will continue.  You're hanging out, right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, they do.  DJ, who kid? 
[02:52:30]  Always a pleasure, sir.  Big fan of your Instagram.  What is your Instagram again?  At just who kid.  Yeah, I don't know.  Okay.  Yeah, good shit.  You're just on my page when I open it up from another part of the fucking world.  I'm so fucking jealous, man.  Yeah.  I should be hitting a couple weird places soon, too.  I'm going to Paris.  I'm going to Croatia.  When are you going to invite us for one of these trips?  I want to disappear.  Croatia.  Yeah, because you do it quick, too.  I'm actually going to Russia.  Oh, I got a DJ for a gun company in Russia, actually. 
[02:53:00]  Wow.  I should bring Anthony out there.  That'd be great.  To check the guns and all that.  Shoot up some shit out there.  What?  We'll go hunting some Chechnya.  Stay away from hunting us all.  Fuck that Chechnya.  Stay away from Sochi.  Yeah.  I'm dead as serious.  Maybe I can get him to fly Anthony out there and shoot some fucking animals.  Dude, you should.  I'll fucking fire up some Kalashnikovs.  Just don't go to the Olympics, motherfucker.  Fuck that.  You see the video, the Desert Eagle video I posted?  Yeah.  Fucking shit's nice.  It's your Google Glasses. 
[02:53:30]  I had Google Glass on.  My Google Glasses.  And fucking shot the Desert Eagle.  And then one guy's trying to tell me, oh, what are you, you got ladies' wrist on you?  I'm like, ladies' wrist?  You try to fucking hold a 50-caliber pistol while you shoot the fucking thing, you assholes.  They just can't help themselves.  They can't.  They're fucking assholes.  Haters.  Right.  Exactly.  This thing's like, BAM!  Fucking loud gun.  Where's this video?  Twitter.  Anthony Cumia. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah, my Twitter.  Super hard.  Also, O-P-A-N-T-X-M.  On YouTube, right?  On YouTube.  Look at them bullets.  Yeah.  Those are big, heavy, fat fucking 50-caliber rounds right there.  Do they hurt if you get hit by him?  Uh, no.  Okay.  Look at this fucking gun.  That gun's giant.  Watch this.  Big as rail-y gun.  It's a fucking big as rail-y gun.  Boom.  Oh, shit.  My God.  It's crazy.  Damn.  Yeah.  What the fuck? 
[02:54:30]  Oh.  Nigga.  Shit.  If I was in your backyard, I'm a dead motherfucker.  With his mask on.  Oh, your head.  Oh, that mask.  That mask could fucking be a great target.  Fuck center mask.  I'm going for head shots.  What does that feel like on your wrist?  It hurts.  It actually hurts?  No, it's not that bad.  You let it kick a little bit, but you keep control of it, and it's not bad.  If you try to stiff-arm it, or it flies back too far, that's fucked. 
[02:55:00]  Hit yourself in the head?  Yeah, I've seen fucking videos of these chicks hitting themselves in the head.  Oh, they're hilarious.  You haven't seen those yet?  No, I haven't seen those.  Are you kidding me?  There's a video of a guy robbing.  I think it was a jewelry store.  You see this guy?  He's got a fucking pistol in his hand, and he points it at the guy, and he's trying to  get the money, and he's taking the money with his left hand and the hand that he's got  the pistol in, with his finger on the trigger, and he must have, like, gone to grab, and 
[02:55:30]  he pulled the trigger, and it shot the guy that was giving him the money in the stomach,  and the kick went up under his chin, and it fired again, and he shot himself right in  the fucking head and dropped and killed him right there.  Is this a video of this?  Oh, yeah.  Where is it?  I don't know.  It's on the intertubes.  Oh, you know.  No, it was, oh, well, I might have seen it there.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's like Robert Made Good or something.  Wow.  So that one-hand thing where you see the black dude shooting in the movies? 
[02:56:00]  Robbery gone wrong.  Maybe that's it.  I don't know.  Is that real?  Four friends returned from a night out.  No, this is different.  Yeah.  Yeah, that guy, like...  Is that real, though?  You can't hold him in one hand and shit.  One hand sideways?  You can't do that, right?  Well, you do that in the hood, and that's why a bunch of grandmas and little three-year-olds are getting  shot in the hood instead of the intended targets.  Oh.  You tip your gun.  I have told people many times, you turn your gun this way, turn your iPhone that way when  you're taking video. 
[02:56:30]  It's the opposite of the gun.  The iPhone goes sideways.  The gun goes straight up and down.  Get it right.  It's a real shit.  We'll see some really good fucking...  Now they have an app.  ...World Slow Hip Hop videos if we do that.  They have that app, though.  Yeah.  That'll fix that shit for you.  Oh, yeah.  All right, we're babbling.  We'll see you guys Monday.  Oh, Monday.  Weekend.  What's up?  Oh, fuck.  Sam wants me to tell you about Stephen... </pre>
