<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a humorous fictional scenario about a rage-inducing virus, immediately transitioning into their recurring "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" segment, prompting a discussion about the bit's longevity, the enduring appeal of breasts, and the absurd hypothetical of breasts ceasing to exist.  The hosts also mocked radio station call letter numbering systems. A Connecticut listener called in, noting a correlation between higher-frequency radio stations and larger contest prizes, leading to further mockery of program directors, including their own, John Minnelli, and his past employment at a newspaper with a perceived conflict of interest.  They then promoted their YouTube videos, specifically one featuring a previous guest, China, and her comments about X-Pac, sparking further discussion of China's appearance and James' attraction to her.  Mike Rowe's previous appearance, particularly a segment about monkeys in South Africa and James's seemingly "retarded" questions, was revisited as a comedic highlight. The hosts also discussed their planned jetpack invention, speculated on the chaos of flying cars, and touched upon their (lack of) reading habits and Jay Leno's contributions to *Popular Mechanics*,  detailing Leno's alleged attempts to get them on his show and insinuations of deliberate blocking.

Listener calls covered a request for a "WOW" sticker, the Boston Red Sox's high bid for Daisuke Matsuzaka (mispronounced as "Yenway Park"), a call from a soldier in Baghdad, a correction of Matsuzaka's name, and comments on racial segregation in Boston.  O.J. Simpson's upcoming televised special detailing his hypothetical murder scenario was mentioned, followed by a discussion involving a listener's small breasts and the "WOW" sticker contest, concluding with promotion for an upcoming "homeless shopping spree." The segment ended with a brief mention of a man unable to smile.

The next segment started with a discussion of Tyra Banks, focusing on her perceived self-centeredness and a show episode where she made the audience strip to their underwear.  The hosts engaged in crude and sexually suggestive commentary about her appearance, particularly her feet. This transitioned into a discussion about their experiences with doctors, including vulgar descriptions of medical examinations and personal hygiene, followed by a caller recounting an uncomfortable car accident en route to a physical. The hosts then debated the importance of clean underwear. The conversation shifted to Marge from the Little Shelter, who needed donations for two puppies born with cleft palates. Their response ranged from indifference to advocating for euthanasia. A caller provided a fundraising update from Cleveland.  A breaking news report on a significant earthquake and tsunami warning in Japan followed, with the hosts reacting with insensitive humor, particularly toward the initial “16-inch wave” report. Listener calls added to the diverse topics. The segment interspersed promotional material for their XM Satellite Radio show and FHM magazine feature, concluding with audio of Apollo 17 astronauts using profanity. Sam was noted as being present in studio.

The following segment opened with a discussion of a couple engaging in sexual activity on a Southwest flight, using crude and sexually explicit language and "mile-high club" puns.  Marge called again regarding the puppies with cleft palates, eliciting more insensitive humor.  Tenacious D (Jack Black and Kyle Gass) then appeared in studio. The conversation covered their career, their movie *Tenacious D: The Pick of Destiny*, a humorous anecdote about Jack Black's past appearance, and a comparison of acting and live performance. They discussed the film's production, including a "Stoniest" scene, referencing various movies and TV shows.  Jack Black shared a story about a strong reaction to *Grey Lady Down* while high. The discussion included Jack Black's weight fluctuations, leading to further jokes. The segment concluded with the hosts' offensive "XM walkover," an offensive intern promotional piece detailing sexually explicit and degrading tasks, further crude jokes, and self-deprecating banter about the show's content, and the planned "Homeless Shopping Spree."

The next segment primarily focused on the poorly-received MTV show "Parental Control,"  with the hosts and Jimmy Norton using vulgar language to critique its unrealistic scenarios.  A caller, Jay, expressed his enthusiasm for the show and XM subscription. A significant portion focused on Jimmy Norton's experiences as a caddy, including anecdotes about golfers, alleged mob connections, and a secret caddy sign for "dickhead" golfers.  This led to further discussions about his past jobs and a mentally challenged boss.  The upcoming availability of iPod video playback on airplanes led to speculation about in-flight pornography. A video of a man being forced to perform oral sex was also mentioned.  A video of a peewee football brawl was shown and discussed, leading to further vulgar commentary.

The final segment heavily featured Little League anecdotes, including humorous and crude recollections of poor performances, embarrassing parental behavior (one mother distracting her son and rooting for the opposing team), and player ineptitude. One story involved a player refusing to run a foul ball until it became fair, another described a player so bad he was moved to multiple positions and allowed a runner to score due to a missed throw. A caller shared a story of soiling himself during a game. The "Spy Report" segment focused on drama between local news anchors. Listener calls added to the baseball discussions, including a listener's account of being hit by a pitch and audio of an astronaut using profanity.  An extended segment showed excited reactions to a woman flashing her breasts, likely related to "Whip-em Out Wednesday." The show concluded with announcements of upcoming segments, including “Board Gossip,” the playing of a song, and a final, extended yell from a production staff member.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Coming through your windows, it was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease.  Fills their veins and blood with pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates, and kills this fast. These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct. I wish to God they weren't.  I thought I'd won. 
[00:00:30]  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules. There's nothing you can do about it.  God almighty.  We've got to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right, we're coming out. Here we go.  O.P.  O.P.  Shut up.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty. 
[00:01:00]  Wipe me.  James Norton.  O.P.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  It is.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Thank goodness.  The only bit we'll do to the end of our careers. 
[00:01:30]  We're always changing bits.  Is that our benchmark?  Well, the benchmark bit is sex in the church.  Well, that's the one we'll remember.  But the Whip-Em-Out Wednesday thing is one of those bits where, yeah, it's...  I'm trying to think of something to liken it to.  Like a Hollywood guy that just what you were like, all right, you're 90 years old, knock  it off already. 
[00:02:00]  Jesus.  Like that...  Wow.  You stumped me.  I know.  You really did.  I completely stumped.  I'm trying to even think of like Rich Little or something or...  Let's see.  Doing his bad Johnny Carson impression.  So you're trying to say that Whip-Em-Out Wednesday's played out?  Are you insane?  No, no.  I'm saying that in years to come, it will be like, all right, guys, you've been doing  it for 80 years.  But it's boobies.  Boobies never get old. 
[00:02:30]  Are you saying boobies are timeless?  What do you think?  Yes.  What do you think?  I agree.  Not per breast or not.  They tend to get awful by the age of 24 as far as I'm...  Well, that's true.  You don't want the same boobs for that many years.  At the 24, it's downhill.  Well, thank God they keep making new ones.  Right.  Thank God.  New ones are rolling off the assembly line every day.  Whip-Em-Out Wednesday would get old if the boobs that are around us are the last boob.  That's it.  That's it.  Unless we could shut off gravity. 
[00:03:00]  Where's the gravity?  Do you know if...  I think you're right.  If that was the only boobs out there were the ones that are on women right now and no  new ones, we as men would figure out a way to shut off the Earth's gravity.  That would be the number one top priority over anything else.  Can you imagine?  It's just like all of a sudden God decides every female born from this day forward can't have  boobs.  Can't have boobs.  So then we're left with just the boobs around us.  Oh my God.  That's the only thing that'll wreck Whip-Em-Out. 
[00:03:30]  Wow.  You'd hear that like years from now.  And the last woman with breasts passed on today.  Right, right.  She died at the age of...  Oh, remember breasts?  Yeah, kind of like the last Titanic survivor.  Yeah, yeah.  One of those.  Remember she had...  Yeah, women used to have those.  And they'll show her as a young thing with her nice boobs.  Yeah.  Stupid Titanic survivors.  Die already.  How come you keep hearing about them?  You keep hearing about the last one dying. 
[00:04:00]  I think we're finally done with the Titanic survivors.  They classify them, though, like the last one.  Here's the last one from England.  Right.  And then the last American one.  Here's the last one with Down syndrome.  Oh, you know there was one.  On a boat.  You know there was one on that boat.  Oh, you think so?  Oh, yeah.  The captain.  The captain.  The captain.  The captain.  The captain.  The captain.  The captain.  The captain.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't even think there's any of them left.  Anyway, it's Whip Em Out Wednesday. 
[00:04:30]  It's survivors.  A waterhead in the water.  I don't know if we focus a lot of time on Whip Em Out Wednesday on our fine radio show.  But it's out there.  It's happening all the time.  It's basically Whip Em Out Whenever.  And all you need for this contest is a lousy WOW bumper sticker.  And you just slap it on the back of your car or your truck.  And that's it.  You do nothing else.  You don't harass the ladies.  You don't follow the ladies.  You just go about your day. 
[00:05:00]  And there are women out there that will flash you if they see the WOW.  It's as simple as that.  That's it.  And then you, yeah, you win.  It's not like one of those contests where the station van has to find you driving with a sticker and pulls you over.  And Peter Van Driver gets out and gives you a prize.  And all you want to do is punch the guy because now you're late.  Just belt him in the head because you waited there for a stupid CD instead of the grand prize because he saw you with the station sticker. 
[00:05:30]  They give you a certificate so you get like $102 worth of free gas.  That's right.  Great.  No, this is WOW.  You stick it on and that's it.  You don't need anybody to do anything else except a girl to see it.  There's plenty of women out there.  More than radio station vans.  Oh, yeah.  And she'll see it.  Pull up next to you.  Give a little flash.  You tip your fedora in acknowledgement.  And there you go. 
[00:06:00]  You're on your way.  So it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  I have a question.  Why is it like the radio stations always use their call letters like this is 92.3 or whatever.  How come this is?  Hey, hey, hey.  We're syndicated across America.  This is 92.3 in New York.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, wow.  That's right.  It could be anywhere.  Just a random number.  It's 104.1 in Boston there.  It's 94.1 in Philly.  Should I keep going?  What's Cleveland?  Don't make me.  Please.  Wait, isn't 94.1 in Cleveland too?  Oh, no.  There's a sheet in front of me.  How lazy am I?  I'm just guessing. 
[00:06:30]  I was going to try to sound all smart and go, oh, Cleveland is 92.3.  Of course it is.  Why are there?  I honestly don't want to know this.  Why is it not five?  How come no one is like five FM?  You just want it to be five?  You're so cute.  I don't understand how the numbers work.  I mean...  It's actually a frequency number.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's an actual frequency number.  There's a mathematic formula behind these numbers.  Okay, so it's not like they're being random and just starting with a high number.  You're right, though. 
[00:07:00]  They should just be one, two, three, four.  By the way, Kevin from Connecticut, always a wise-ass.  I always listen to stations up around 105, 106, 107, because they give away more cash  than the stations down near 92, 93, 94.  That's true.  You'll get a few extra bucks up at the top of the dial.  That's smart.  All right, we got...  Stop using decimal points.  Use fractions.  Five and a quarter FM.  How do you tune that in?  One and three-eighths.  Oh, I've worked for radio stations over the years where they drop the point because it's 
[00:07:30]  cooler to say, like, I don't know, 103.3.  But there's no idea.  It'll confuse everyone.  Back in the day, I worked for the Fox and Buffalo, and it wasn't 103.3.  That sounded old school.  Yeah.  We're 103.3.  Or sometimes it doesn't fit, like, their little thing, like, if they want to rhyme something.  Like, we're here for you at 92.  Like, they can't say 0.3, you know, because it screws it up.  But it's not 92.  You're over a little more.  Stupid program directors. 
[00:08:00]  If you're a program director, you stink.  Hey.  These guys, they would sit there like, all right, this is what we're going to do.  It's now 103.3, the Fox.  And he would sit in his office waiting for the ratings to come in, and nothing would happen.  And I'm like, of course nothing would happen, because no one gives a crap that it's not being called 0.3 anymore.  The 0.3 thing was really taking away from the greatness.  I couldn't tell you the last time I listened to a program director.  I couldn't tell you.  Uh-oh.  I could not tell you.  With our good friend here now. 
[00:08:30]  Well, John Minnelli, I do respect it.  Actually, I do listen to him, and I actually have consulted him over the years.  And now he's officially our boss, I guess, or our-  I like to call him our company.  He's our boss.  Ha-ha.  We're your boss.  Ooh.  What do you think of that?  Ooh.  I'd love to see what he thinks of that.  I dare him to not like that.  He's our program director.  He used to just sit there writing down answers to the questions he'd give us and have some guy snapping pictures of us. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, right.  To put us in a newspaper that he had a conflict of interest with.  That's right.  Glad you got fired.  That's right.  That's what we say to John Minnelli today.  I don't know about you guys.  Welcome, John.  Welcome, John.  When I have questions, I go to Tom for counsel.  Do you?  I want to know what he thinks I should do with certain jokes, and Tom helps me.  Well, sometimes Tom comes to me, and I go, Tom, you're out.  You better be careful with Tom.  He's going to sponsor your joke soon.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Tom's mention of his name, Tom, is sponsored by Tom McCann Shoes. 
[00:09:30]  Anyway, it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Enjoy out there.  This fine little thing we've given to society.  The gift.  The gift of wow.  Some people give polio vaccines.  Yeah.  To the world.  Yeah.  Some people, space travel.  Yeah.  Air travel.  Yeah.  Things like that.  We giveth unto you. 
[00:10:00]  Wow.  Enjoy it on this Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  And we're also going to give you the jet pack soon.  Yeah, yeah.  That'll be coming out.  And I working on that in the Opie and Anthony lab.  We're going to be the ones to figure out the jet pack.  That'll be good.  Look for our brains splattered on a wall somewhere.  The jet pack.  I like when they want to invent things for people that are supposed to be here already  in the future, but people are still too stupid.  We assumed people were going to be smart enough to fly their own flying car. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  But they still can't get it on two dimensions.  They're still banging into each other in two-dimensional space on streets.  We thought for some reason we'd be smart enough to, you know, just wing around the sky in flying cars.  That would be awesome.  And rocket packs.  You know how many cars you would see explode in midair?  Oh, how great would that be?  That would be wonderful.  Could you see the, I thought the jet pack, I hit the brake, but I hit the accelerator and  ran into a school. 
[00:11:00]  Like there'd be people doing the same dopey things they do in cars with jet packs.  Stupid female drivers would go out of the atmosphere.  Could you see her trying?  She's like jet packing with that stupid scissor-like eyelash curler.  I'm late for work.  Headlong into a pier.  Right out of the atmosphere.  I can't figure out how to go straight in the air.  I can't find my wife.  She's in orbit somewhere dead and frozen with an eyelash curler stuck to her eye. 
[00:11:30]  Only to be found like a thousand years from now.  Yeah.  We're not ready for it.  Well, the first step in that is going to be planes that leave the atmosphere and come back down,  which they're working on now.  They'll get you from New York to L.A. in 15 minutes or so.  I've been reading about that in Popular Science and Popular Mechanics for years.  Really?  That along with how the lighter than air dirigible is coming back.  Every month on Popular Mechanics they have that.  The dirigible's coming back.  Is it really?  Well, that's slow. 
[00:12:00]  Nobody wants a dirigible.  No one wants a dirigible.  We'll have you in L.A. in 24 hours.  I don't even like saying dirigible.  How can you?  It's horrible.  It's stupid.  I say dirigible.  You say dirigible, I say dirigible.  Let's call the whole thing off.  You should be spanked for just admitting that you read Popular Mechanics.  I'll pull my pants down.  Who's up?  You Frank Morris trying to get out of jail?  The only time I read those type of magazines is if I'm in a dentist's office and there's  nothing else to read.  You know where you put it?  I'll go to the Sports Illustrated that's been laying there since 2003 before I go to the 
[00:12:30]  Popular Mechanics.  Not a sports guy.  You know where it makes great reading?  Toilet.  It sits right back on the back of the toilet tank.  Yeah.  And you pop out the Popular Mechanics.  Yeah.  You're done in a second.  Yeah.  Great.  Leno's got a nice little column in there about all his classic cars and then he could read  about...  Yeah, he does all...  How does this guy have the time for all that crap?  He writes an entire column for Popular Mechanics every month about his cars.  How does he have time?  He does a stupid one-hour TV show a day that's filled up with guests, filled up with comedy 
[00:13:00]  writers.  Fair enough, sir.  And lots of commercials.  Easiest job in entertainment, that's what I say.  You can get 8,000 things to do than write an article about your classic cars in Popular  Mechanics.  He loves his cars.  And I don't know what...  How does he have the time to watch my Letterman set and comment on how much weight I lost,  I found out.  I don't know how he does it.  Oh, really?  Did he call you personally?  No, no, no, but the bookers are friends of mine.  They said, yeah, we all watched it.  And they're like, Jay watched it.  And he keeps saying, how did he lose the weight?  Can I tell you something about Jay Leno? 
[00:13:30]  I found out that somebody is C-blocking us big time.  And they decide not to tell us that they're C-blocking.  You want to date Jay Leno?  Jay Leno has been trying to get us on his show.  He's attempted three times.  Three times.  Right now, I am accepting his invitation.  And that is not a lie.  Going through past everybody.  And I don't want to listen to nobody at this joint. 
[00:14:00]  Nobody.  We do all shows.  It's a fact.  Three times they try to get us on Jay Leno.  He's been supportive since September of 2004 when I first did it.  He's been very supportive of the show.  I'm not into the talk show wars.  We are neutral.  Here's something.  I love it.  If it's a conflict of interest or something, or you just want to C-block for the hell of C-blocking,  you got to tell us.  Instead of getting those calls and just making believe you never got those calls and never telling us. 
[00:14:30]  Because it's going to get back to us eventually.  And it's not a conflict of interest at all.  No.  At all.  To do the Tonight Show, you've got a massive audience.  Yeah.  And he's promoted the show to be silly to not do it.  Silly.  Silly.  Especially when I lost so much weight.  Thank you, Jay.  That's pretty cool, Jimmy.  All right.  So it's Whip Him Out Wednesday.  We got that out of the way.  New videos.  New Opie and Anthony videos.  We don't go over the list every day.  But there's a couple on here that are worth mentioning for a number of reasons.  We got Poke the Witch. 
[00:15:00]  That's finally up.  Which is just kind of a goofy little bit we did on the walkover the other day.  But we have video of Jimmy admitting that he loves China.  When you said Jimmy admitting, my heart just went, meh.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  I mean, I love China.  That's fine.  Oh, the girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, man.  She was great.  You were smitten yesterday.  I was.  There was love in your eyes.  Why?  I don't know, man.  She looked really kissable.  She had really pretty kissable lips.  But they were like collagen.  Maybe they were, but I still would have kissed them. 
[00:15:30]  I mean, I'm sure they were, but I don't care.  I would have still give just...  She would have mothered me.  Like, I would like her to have held me like a...  See, that's...  Yeah.  Like in a papoose.  I wanted her to hold me in a papoose and kiss me.  That's the feeling I was getting.  Yeah.  Like off of you.  Oh, when you saw her when she walked in.  Yeah.  Didn't she look completely different than you remembered her looking?  Oh, yeah.  Well, she's had a lot of plastic surgery.  She's had a lot of stuff done. 
[00:16:00]  If you do look at images on the net of China from even...  You've got to start around...  When she had her first, like...  Well, you've got to start around 96, 97.  When she started with the WWF, she had a massive man's jaw.  She looked like Sergeant Slaughter's daughter.  Yeah.  She had the jaw pretty much removed and replaced.  I don't know.  And now you can tell the lips have been filled in.  And I think she got some kind of cheek implant.  Oh, yeah.  She's got all sorts of stuff.  She looks like the hottest tranny.  Yeah.  Definitely.  And I think that might be what Jimmy... 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  Bell just went off in my head.  Good point.  Oh, good point.  She sounded a little bit like a tranny.  Like...  Yeah, yeah.  She's got that...  She always had that deep voice kind of thing.  There's something going on there.  I don't know.  She's trying to put on a female voice.  I would be naked, right?  Totally nude.  And she'd be dressed like that.  And she would hold me.  And just...  We would...  She wouldn't kiss me like a baby.  She would tussle my hair like a baby.  And then deep French kiss me.  See, you got this...  This mothering thing.  But I normally don't, though.  I like small women.  I don't like big women. 
[00:17:00]  Wow, really?  Yeah.  She's a big gal.  Yeah, but she's in shape, though.  But I would want her to hold me.  Is that what the mothers carry their kids in?  In those front napsack things?  I am so proud to say I haven't a clue what one of those are called.  But Papoose, I think was the engine, would put it on their back.  I want her to carry me in...  Let me amend that.  Forget the Papoose.  The Papoose is so 1790.  I want her to carry me on the front thing and make out with me.  I like how Indians put their kids on their back so if they fell, the kid would be safe. 
[00:17:30]  But these days, you strap them to the front so if you fall on your face, you get to crush  your child.  Watch yourself if someone punches you or they hit the kid's back and not you.  When was the last time you fell on your face, though?  Baby Bjorn?  Last night at that cancer benefit, I'd say I fell on my face.  Oh, really?  We'll talk about that in a minute, too.  Anyway, so the China thing, I don't get it.  Jimmy gets it.  Jimmy had that look of love in his eyes yesterday.  And then we have a video of China implying that X-Pac is a gay drug addict.  Yeah.  That is now up on YouTube. 
[00:18:00]  Gay drug addict.  If you throw Opie and Anthony in the search.  Wife abuser or girlfriend abuser.  And then I'm getting feedback yesterday and people are like, why didn't you go with that?  I don't feel like getting beat up by X-Pac.  But we did kind of go with it.  We asked her to elaborate on it, to say what was said that led her to believe that he's gay.  I asked her if she ever had any, did he ever request any equipment that a belt be worn?  Yeah, who's saying what?  You can't just go out and accuse people of that, though. 
[00:18:30]  There's something called lawsuits if you just go out and go, so-and-so's gay.  We asked her plenty.  We asked her plenty.  So we did all right with that?  I think so.  All right, well, the video's up on YouTube.  Jimmy got a nice big hug.  Did you bury your face?  How could you not?  She smelled really good.  She gave me a very mothering, a nice hug.  Her ample bosom was pressed against me.  Yeah, you kind of leaned your head there.  How could you not?  You could see her dirty pillars.  It was like two Paul Stanley arms.  Two at once. 
[00:19:00]  All right, let's go to Alabama.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, I'm nothing more than driving around, buddy.  Hey there, Brian.  Well, why are you calling the show?  Let's go.  I was calling to tell you all.  I think y'all are the greatest radio station in the world, and I was just wanting to know  how can I get one of those stickers, buddy?  You want a WOW sticker?  Go to opianthony.com.  That's the easiest way.  Oh, okay, okay.  I appreciate it, buddy.  Individual radio stations have their own version, but if you go to opianthony.com, we'll get  you a WOW sticker.  Thanks, mister.  All right. 
[00:19:30]  Thank you, man.  If you live in San Francisco, contact that station, and you can get a WOW eye covering.  Jesus.  Yes.  Wow, postage stamp.  Oh, it's awful.  They're so tiny.  They do that just so they won't hear a lot of malarkey out there.  Right.  Come on, San Francisco.  Commit.  Step it up.  The WOW stickers are a little small.  I'm going to talk to one of the big Hollander bosses about that.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Dinner tonight with the flying Hollanders.  With the boys.  They fly a lot.  Dave, Pennsylvania.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing today?  Good.  What a great show yesterday with China and Mike Rowe from you guys had on. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, Mike Rowe's great, man.  He is great.  What great stories, especially the ones with the monkeys where they're jumping off the roof  and attacking them.  Yeah, that monkey story.  And Jimmy's retarded, innocent little questions had me laughing during the replay.  I was laughing my ass off.  You're like a small, retarded child asking simple little questions.  That was over on the XM side, right?  We brought Michael Rowe's. 
[00:20:30]  And he was telling a story about having been to South Africa with these people that live  among these little teeny monkeys.  And they're not the big gorilla ones.  They're like these little three-foot-tall monkeys that are just like.  Obnoxious, nasty, biting.  They're as nasty as rats.  You want to make little ashtrays out of their little monkey hands.  Actually, they're worse than rats because they attack you.  And they fly and jump.  Yeah.  And he was telling a story about how he got scratched when they went.  It was a really interesting story.  One of his cameramen got his calf bit right to the bone by one of these monkeys.  And they throw feces, and they bite you, and they're bleeding their gums. 
[00:21:00]  They're disgusting creatures.  And they did it on Dirty Jobs, I guess, right?  Yeah.  It wasn't an actual Dirty Job, but it was like a special Dirty Job episode, I guess.  It was during a time during Shark Week where the weather was a little inclement,  and they had to find something else to do that day and dropped in on this woman that has a house full of these monkeys.  It sounds cute.  Kind of like the old cat lady that has to take all the cats in.  Yeah.  There's one in every neighborhood in America.  Well, there's a lady down there in Africa that is a monkey lady.  And they run free in the house, right? 
[00:21:30]  Yes.  And believe me, like we said, they're not in little coveralls wearing engineer hats running around doing human things.  They are vicious creatures with big, sharp teeth.  And Mike was talking about that, and apparently I caught myself as I was going on, because I wasn't doing it on purpose, but I'm a boob.  I just ask boobish questions.  Like, I think when he told me, like, yeah, and there's Mike in his man's voice, and the monkey jumped on my back. 
[00:22:00]  He scratched me.  Like, I forget what I asked him, but it was something like, what was it, Sam?  Was it an accident?  Yeah.  Was it an accident that he scratched you?  I'm like, I didn't want to acknowledge the monkey might have attacked him, so I'm hoping, like, was it an accident?  Yeah.  Was it an accident?  Do they have bugs?  How many monkeys are in the house?  Does the lady, are the monkeys nice to the lady?  I did ask her if they were.  You asked the dumbest questions, and I was roaring.  Are the monkeys nice to the lady? 
[00:22:30]  I didn't even mean to do it, and I finally caught myself and realized what a jackass I sounded like.  It was so funny.  It was like he was giving, like, a speech to a third grade class, and Jimmy was the one just asking all the questions.  It was like when I was a little boy, and the fireman showed up, and all the kids wanted to go out in the truck, but I got yelled at, because I was jumping in and out of the fireman's boots, and they told me to sit down, and they put me on Ritalin.  Ritalin.  Were you on Ritalin as a kid?  No, they were going to put me on, but for some reason, I think it was the wisdom of Mother who thought it would stifle my creativity, a.k.a. I was a spoiled little douche. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, they didn't put me on.  There were times over the years I thought I would need a little Mother's Little Helper.  Yeah.  Just a little dose.  A little something.  I figured it would just mellow me out too much, and I would just stink on the radio.  Get you through.  I don't think I need that crap anymore, but there were a few years there I was like, you know what?  Maybe just something to take the edge off.  Take the edge off.  And then I would be doing the radio show with you guys like, everything's great.  This is cool, man.  It's Whip Him Out Wednesday, and isn't life great? 
[00:23:30]  And then a panicked look between me and Jim and go, oh my God, he's doing the drugs.  He'd be like Nicholson after he had the scars on his forehead.  That's exactly what I...  Taylor's friend when he spun him around after they cut out his brain.  Right.  On Planet of the Apes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Damn.  Baboons.  Oh, I chose against that, and it worked out fine for me, so I'm very happy.  Yeah.  You're in violation.  I'm itchy.  I got this shirt, and I washed it, and it's still itching.  I have such sensitive baby skin. 
[00:24:00]  All right.  We'll talk about your baby skin after the break.  How about someone throw up lotion on it?  Hey, Tenacious D, Jack Black, and the other guy coming in today.  What time am I in?  What?  What time am I in?  Sometime in the 8 o'clock hour.  Andrew Ridgely?  That's at, I don't know, 8 o'clock hour.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.

[00:25:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Ah, good morning.  Let's say hi to Boston today.  What's up, Boston?  Boston.  You awake yet?  Enjoy, uh...  Vinny.  Enjoy Vinny.  Jesus, what are they thinking up there?  What happened with Vinny?  Vinny has the Jedi mind trick.  If he is able to actually...  No, here we go, Jimmy. 
[00:25:30]  Let me just say this.  I only heard Vinny if you tell me that Testaverde is somehow involved in football again.  43 years old.  What is he coaching?  Um, no.  No.  He's the backup to Tom Brady.  The Patriots signed him.  He's a great guy.  Of course he is.  Didn't we try this a couple years ago when he was old then?  Yeah.  He's 43 in football years.  Who was pointing it out in the office? 
[00:26:00]  43 in baseball years?  That's acceptable.  Roger Clemens, I'm sure, will pitch next year.  He's about the same age, right?  But that's the age in baseball where they look at you and go,  wow, this guy's had quite a career, you know.  He's in his 40s.  A lot of 40-year-olds in baseball nowadays.  Yeah.  But not many 40-year-olds in football.  No, football just rips you apart.  He's 43 in the patch just signed him.  God bless Vinny Testaverde, but you better hope that Tom Brady doesn't go down.  He can win a game for you in a pinch.  I mean, you know, Vinny, not that he sucks, but that's the guy you want leading your team. 
[00:26:30]  Maybe there's nobody else.  Why else would they give out a foot?  They should have signed Flutie because at least Flutie is still mobile.  He can run around like crazy.  How old is Doug Flutie?  He retired finally.  I was a college student.  But Vinny has bad knees and all that.  At least Flutie would run around a little bit for you.  Why not sign Danny White in case your kicker goes down too?  You could have a punter and a quarterback.  Oh, remember Danny White?  Oh, boy.  Starback was a tough act to follow in Dallas.  He was mediocre in two positions. 
[00:27:00]  I'm waiting for someone to sign old Broadway Joe Namath.  Get Joe Willie back.  Rumors that we have Joe Namath calling in sometime after the holiday.  I'm very excited about it.  By the way, we have to say hi to Boston as well.  They got Vinny Testerverde to back up Tom Brady.  And they also won the lottery.  And they get to the...  I don't even understand this.  It's a Yenway Park.  What?  He's one of the greatest Japanese pitchers nowadays. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, right.  Yep.  And something's going on with Japanese baseball and Major League Baseball.  You have to bid for the right to negotiate with their players or something like that?  Has anyone been following this story?  So the Red Sox, $51 million they bid so they can negotiate with Yenway Park.  So they've spent $51 million already.  Just so they can...  And that's not a guarantee that he's actually going to pitch for the Red Sox? 
[00:28:00]  Wow.  Right?  Sort of?  What?  I don't know.  Uh-huh.  Huh?  Well, this has been a big baseball story.  It's got to be refundable.  Because the Mets and the Yankees also wanted to talk to this guy.  I guess he's the real deal.  The Yankees want to talk to him.  He must be over 40.  And the Red Sox won the right to try to negotiate with this guy by spending $51 million.  Oh, my God.  Japanese baseball is going to just take over the major leagues eventually.  Although you're not going to get a lot of power hitters.  You're going to get a lot of pitchers, though.  Japanese guys do well when they come in. 
[00:28:30]  Like, who's the guy from the Yankees that I actually like?  Hideki Matsui is a great player.  They have great fundamentals.  But they haven't done my Hideki Arabu.  Stunk.  You know, you get a few of them.  Chanho Park is good.  All right, let's go to Kentucky.  Nice to see Boston coming into the new century with some people from different ethnic backgrounds.  I know.  They're actually bringing this guy over just to do some railroad work.  Going to put a pointy hat on him?  Yeah.  He's going to figure out the big dig for everybody. 
[00:29:00]  They don't even – Boston, they're so segregated.  They don't even realize there's different races, like, in groups of Asian.  They figure this covers, like, Japanese, Chinese, Korean.  They don't think anybody will know.  They're going to market it as everything.  It is a well-kept secret.  It's the most amazing thing to walk around downtown Boston and not see one black guy, one Asian person, one Hispanic.  It's unbelievable.  There are borders up there, and people stay to their areas, and that's it.  That's how it works.  That's how it's been for years. 
[00:29:30]  They don't care.  It's not like America.  All right, here's the deals.  Like paradise.  D-Block's helping us out.  The Sox had to buy out his contract for $50 million before they could negotiate.  Yeah, that's pretty much what we were saying, I guess.  Terry in Kentucky, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, I just wanted to call in and say that I'm, well, I don't know how to say it.  Dumb?  Well, I'm home for two weeks from Iraq, and I actually caught you guys' numbers, so I want 
[00:30:00]  to call in and say you guys give us a lot of laughs.  We'll listen to you on the internet over there.  Are you working the motor pool or out there?  Oh, I'm out there.  I'm out there blowing shit up.  All right.  He's out there blowing things up.  What press of the service do you say?  I'm in the Army.  Okay.  Oh, those guys, man.  You guys have it right.  I went over there with the Air Force, and the Air Force has the best stuff, like amenities-wise.  They have the most money, I think, because they get the planes. 
[00:30:30]  It's always been that way.  Poor Army guys, man.  You guys get stuck in the mud.  You guys got the best chow.  Yeah, the Air Force is by far the best food.  I almost said chow, but then I realized I'm a man.  Air Force has always, always had the best of everything during wartime.  World War II, they were able to go back to houses in England and sit down to civilized  dinners, and then they're back up over France or Germany, bombing things, and if they made  it back, they're sitting there sipping tea, screwing English women, and having nice dinners. 
[00:31:00]  Where are you stationed in Iraq, sir?  I'm in Baghdad.  Can't exactly tell you what part, but I'm in Baghdad.  All right, well, be safe, man, and thanks for calling in.  Hey, thank you, sir.  This next guy's going to call me dumb, but, you know, I think you guys will agree that  you're not dumb.  Who knew?  Steve in Port Jefferson.  Go ahead, Steve.  Morning, One.  How are you?  Pretty good.  James, I saw you at a Hammerstone the other night. 
[00:31:30]  You were wonderful.  Thank you for coming, buddy.  I wouldn't call you dumb, okay?  I can never call you that.  I just got to call you out.  I believe you were talking about the Japanese pitcher.  Yeah, the Japanese pitcher now, I think it went by everyone's heads this morning, by  the way, and I think it also went by a lot of the listeners' heads.  I just caught it.  Usually, you could call me out for being stupid.  I have no defense, but on this one, I have no defense.  On this one, I think a lot of people are going to be like, oh, my God.  All right.  Go ahead.  Explain, Steve.  Did you call the pitcher Yenway Park? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  That sounds like a Japanese name to me, doesn't it?  Oh, that's why it was so smooth, but his name is Daisuke Matsuzaka, I believe, and that  was a play on Fenway Park.  Yeah, there you go.  But did you know that, Ant?  Did you know that, Ant?  No, I had no clue.  I just assumed the pitcher's name was Yenway Park.  Yenway.  But they were playing off Fenway Park because they had to spend a lot of money to talk to  this guy.  Not only did I not catch it, but as you just said it again, until you explained it, I  didn't catch it again when you said Yenway Park. 
[00:32:30]  I'm like, that must be the name of the manager or something.  It's Daisuke Matsuzaka?  Yeah.  Correct.  What's wrong with Bob Smith?  I know.  Yeah.  Bob Smith over there.  All right, Steve.  Thanks for correcting me.  I appreciate it.  All right.  So there you go.  That's the latest in the sports world, I guess.  That's our sports wrap-up.  Yeah, that's the big stories, though.  When I saw the Vinny thing, I thought I had an old newspaper that was laying around the  joint.  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  I'm like, this cannot be real.  I think he wants to be a coach someday, so I mean, he'll...  Someday.  But Tom Brady doesn't need help.  All it takes, all it takes is one little...  You're trying to tell me Tom Brady goes out and Vinny's going to get you a Super Bowl?  Love the guy.  He's a great guy.  Ain't going to happen.  It would be great if Tom Brady didn't get hurt, they win the Super Bowl, and then Vinny  finally gets a ring.  That would be really cool for a lot of New York fans. 
[00:33:30]  Would it?  But would he actually contribute?  I don't know.  Wait and see.  Let's say hi to Dan in Boston.  Dan, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Oh, and hey.  What's up?  What's up, man?  You guys are so full of it about the segregation in Boston.  I enjoy your jokes just like everybody else, but you're just wrong.  It's just like the Upper West Side where Hope lives.  You go down to the back there, Beacon Hill, you see a lot of rich white people, but you see  the browns all over the place. 
[00:34:00]  Just go to downtown Cross and the fucking jig is all over the place.  Way to explain yourself, sir.  Yeah.  A real way to explain his point right there by throwing in racial epithets and curses.  Look, I think, yeah, there's segregation going on in pretty much every city in America, but  Boston really, you walk around, it's a lot wider than any other city.  Yeah, there are some borders.  The mayor actually said it during the campaign, and he said, I'm going to do something about  those blacks that moved across the street. 
[00:34:30]  I love how you guys are pretending to be loving him, but I know you guys are hating him.  Hating who?  Hating who?  Hating who?  Wait.  Hating who?  Hating who?  I missed that.  I don't know.  All right.  Hating Boston?  We loved Boston.  I think you meant certain racial backgrounds.  What we hate is Cleveland.  Yeah.  We love Cleveland.  Oh, yeah.  We love Cleveland.  Yeah.  It's Columbus we can't stand.  Right.  Right.  Bunch of wannabe Clevelanders. 
[00:35:00]  Now they're all saying, hey, hey, we're listening to.  He still insists he's innocent, but O.J. Simpson is willing to tell how he would have murdered  two people.  He's taking part in a televised special called O.J. Simpson.  If I did it, here's how it happened.  There's a quote.  Lair on another network later this month, just before the release of Simpson's new book  about the murder of his ex-wife and her friend, Simpson was cleared of a killing of the killings  in a criminal trial.  Was he?  He was later held liable for the deaths in a civil lawsuit. 
[00:35:30]  Huh?  You got to love O.J.  He is.  How could you not?  How do you not love the guy?  Now, now, I didn't get.  I want to.  I want you to understand.  I didn't kill these people.  But if I did, here's how I would have done it.  He's brilliant.  That's his show.  That's going to be his interview.  He can't help himself.  He wants to tell.  He wants to tell how it was done.  He wants to tell. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, because you know something?  We probably, and by we, I mean society, probably has it like 99% right how he did it.  But there's probably a couple of details that are annoying him so badly.  Like, I did not do that.  There was no struggle?  I did not drop that glove there.  I didn't do.  There was no struggle.  There was probably like that, yeah.  I slipped on the blood.  Yeah.  You know?  Listen to Bruno Mali's shoes.  Right.  Never wear those shoes.  Like, probably a couple of details that are just pissing him off. 
[00:36:30]  And he's got to get it out.  Like, I would struggle with a white woman.  Yeah.  Like, I struck.  That was no struggle.  This is OJ.  He has to get it.  He's got to talk about it.  He's got to talk about it.  And he's got to be in the public eye.  The guy is a fame whore.  He can't help himself.  Is he broke?  He's got to be getting money for this.  He's getting his pension money that Goldman and Brown family can't touch.  So he's getting his pension money, which he's living off of. 
[00:37:00]  And he's not doing any other work.  So I don't even know if he can get money from this and not have it taken away.  Because of the civil suit.  But, again, he is a publicity whore.  He loves the attention.  I think that's why he's doing this.  Because now he's back in the news.  Look.  OJ's back.  I think it's either going to be a real accurate depiction of what happened.  And you're going to go, oh, my God.  The guy is pretty much confessing to this murder.  Or he's going to try yet again to exonerate himself by going, what I would do is 50 Colombians would jump over her gate and go up behind her with a shotgun and shoot her while her head is buried in cocaine. 
[00:37:30]  That's how I would do it.  Like something so ridiculous.  Right.  I would use A-10 Warthog planes and strafe her house.  If I did.  But I didn't.  I want to make that clear.  I want to make myself look better. 
[00:38:00]  Like, I would tickle her to death and tell her I love you until she died.  Coochie-coo.  Coochie-coo.  And a little tickle, too, for the guy that's having sex with you.  And here's the sunglasses.  Nah, he's going to tell us exactly how it happened.  You think that's what it's going to be?  Exactly like it happened.  Oh, yeah.  Here's how I would have done it.  This is what happened.  Then I would have had a plane.  I mean, this is what I would have done.  Would have.  Then I got on a plane to Chicago.  I would have got on a plane.  Right.  He's going to have to keep correcting himself.  I mean, oh, wow. 
[00:38:30]  Well, you know something?  It will probably be a ratings grabber.  So the ad for it on Fox News here in New York and the girl behind the desk, I guess they  call her the anchor in the morning, the woman, should be getting the cameraman coffee.  We call her the newsreader.  Yeah, the newsreader.  She was talking about the story Disgusted.  Disgusted.  And O.J. Simpson back in the news, he's going to be talking about he didn't murder the two. 
[00:39:00]  But if he did, this is how he would have done it.  It'll be airing on Fox.  And she was like disgusted and then realized it's her own network that's airing it.  Right.  How disgusted could you be?  You want to make a point?  You want to protest it?  Get up and leave and say, I won't work for this company.  Go ahead.  Have a set.  But she didn't.  Let's say hi to Megan.  Megan, what's up?  Hey, I was, well, first of all, I wanted to tell you, Vinny Testerudy is going to be 
[00:39:30]  the third string quarterback and Matt Castle's second string.  Yeah, but they don't have much, they don't have much confidence in him, I guess, huh?  Not a whole lot, no, but he's, he'll get better, I think.  But that's not my main reason for calling.  Oh.  Yeah, I knew that Pats had a backup quarterback, but he doesn't really play.  He's in his second year or something?  Yeah, and he never played in college.  Then how the hell did he get into the NFL?  What does he do?  Yeah.  I have no idea.  He must have, like, nudie pictures of Belichick or something. 
[00:40:00]  He must have something.  I don't know.  He's okay, but he's just, uh.  Am I talking sports with a broad?  Look at you.  Oh, you're talking sports with a broad.  Can you be wearing a little hat wrapped up on the sidelines?  God, I hate them on the sidelines.  They're just worthless.  I'm just kidding, Megan.  All right, what do you got?  What do you got?  Okay, my main question is, I am a small girl, and I'm wondering, I've never done, I've never 
[00:40:30]  wowed a guy because I don't think they're interested, but I wanted to know, are they interested  in smaller girls?  Absolutely.  What do you mean by, what do you mean, the boobs are small, or your whole body's small?  Well, the whole body, but yeah, my boobs specifically.  All right, how small?  I'm like a small B.  That's nice.  What are you, 32B?  Hmm?  32, 34B?  She's really an A, but she buys the Bs to make herself feel a little better, right?  Right, Megan?  We can be honest here.  I'm an A plus, B minus. 
[00:41:00]  That's cool.  How about that?  You have a great GPA, but for anything else, worthless.  Aren't infants born with an A plus?  Isn't every woman born with A's?  Absolutely.  And A pluses?  And then they're supposed to grow.  When did you realize they weren't going to grow at all?  What age?  I think I was a little disappointed probably around 14 or so.  A little disappointed when all your little classmates started getting things to talk about, and you  just stayed like you were when you were in second grade? 
[00:41:30]  That's got to suck as a girl.  Look, honestly, where I'm at with small boobs, they're fine.  They're fine.  Fine and dandy.  But there's girls out there, like, every summer they're looking in the mirror hoping and hoping  and nothing is happening, and their friends are coming over, and they're blossoming.  And they're just right out there, too, for everyone to see.  It's not like, you know, if a guy's got...  Hung like an acorn, he can hide that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, hide it.  You don't have to worry about it.  But women, it's there.  It's this.  So then as you're growing, you're looking and going, oh, come on, maybe next year. 
[00:42:00]  What tipped you off?  Like, the first time a guy put his hand up your shirt, he was like, yeah, and his hand  just went right through and jammed you in the eye?  Or was it the subtle, he's kissing you, and his hand goes up your shirt, and you hear  him go, ugh.  Actually, maybe it was a sensitive guy, and he put the hand up the shirt, it came out  her collar, and he just grabbed her chin and kissed her.  And massaged her chin.  Had to make it seem like it was a romantic move.  No, I think A's and B's, I think they're sexy, man.  I'm not just being nice, either.  I think they're very sexy. 
[00:42:30]  I don't care about that at all.  Yeah.  So show them.  As long as your head's not small.  It's all proportioned, right.  If it's all proportioned, you know, a petite girl, that looks great.  Yeah, if you're going to be a fat broad, you've got to have...  You can't be a flatso.  You've got to make sure you have the big, huge, ugly boobs.  Ugly boobs.  I'm small all over.  I'm small all over.  Yeah, you're a little girl.  Megan, so 14, you finally realize, no way is this going to happen for me, huh?  Yeah, I had a feeling.  I remember my mother told me that the most depressing thing I ever said to her was that 
[00:43:00]  I'll never look like Face Hill or any of those pretty, tall, pretty girls.  No.  Oh, boy.  So I bet you, starting at 14, you worked on other things, right?  Better of.  Did you become proficient in certain acts?  Right.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  I haven't gotten any complaints.  Well, I'm not going to be known as the girl with the nice set in high school, but I'll  be known for my nickname, Hoover. 
[00:43:30]  Love me.  So what did they do?  Throw you in gymnastics?  I was a ballet dancer.  Oh, yeah.  Is it embarrassing when you're wearing your bikini top and the wind is blowing and you  see the two little cones flapping with the breeze?  Oh.  I'm just teasing you.  I think it's very sexy.  If your head is a normal size, you're fine.  That's the worst thing when you're like regular person size with a progeria kid head.  Yeah, you don't want the little head.  What you should do is just take advantage of your situation and wear pigtails all the 
[00:44:00]  time.  There you go.  The movie's cheap.  Yeah.  I do still get carded, I have to say, and people think I'm like 14 or 15.  How old are you?  29.  Yeah, by the way.  That would annoy me if I grabbed her off a sidewalk and found out she was 29.  You tell her to call her parents and she calls her husband and her kids?  You're like, oh, this stinks.  Go home.  Go home.  Hey, everyone's saying that any boobs are good boobs there, Megan.  All right.  So are you going to whip them out for Whip Them Out Wednesday?  I will show them off if I find somebody with a WAP sticker. 
[00:44:30]  Tell those Boston guys to get more.  All right.  I have a question for Megan.  What car are you driving?  Because we want to make sure the guys get close enough so they can see them.  Tell them to bring their binoculars.  Are your nipples big?  No.  Small?  They're pretty small, yeah.  Oh, boy.  That's very cute.  I'm looking at them right now.  Oh.  Are you?  John Mayer's on Oprah.  That really makes me sick.  John Mayer is really famous.  Yeah, he is.  Damn it, that bugs me.  All right.  Megan, it's Whip Them Out Wednesday. 
[00:45:00]  You definitely whip them out.  And I'm sure some guys will enjoy it, okay?  Okay, thanks.  All right.  Yeah, guys, and girls, because there's girls that are into this, too.  You've got to get the WOW stickers on your cars and trucks and bicycles and whatever you use to go to work or school.  All shapes and sizes.  And there are women out there like Megan, small ones, big ones, sloppy ones, distorted ones, only ones.  Missing ones.  Missing ones.  Because even the freak show ones aren't the entertaining to look at. 
[00:45:30]  It's always fun no matter what it is.  Of course it is.  It's Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Get the WOW sticker on your vehicle.

Hey, and ladies, thank you for participating, and guys, we say it all the time, and it's worked like a charm.  Do not harass or follow the ladies.  Let them do what they want to do, and then you move on.  All right.  It's an old dolphin body.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Oh, jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle all the way. 
[00:46:00]  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The O.P. and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerate shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden Funds is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:46:30]  Bye.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ah, we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, what's up, pests?  Where are the pests at today?  Who are they bothering for us today?  Got to acknowledge the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's a virus, the O.P. virus, spreading across America. 
[00:47:00]  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  Thank you, Silver, from Jersey.  CBS in New York is teasing a story for tonight's newscast about a guy who can't smile.  No way.  He even looks like old Jimmy a bit.  No.  I think I know him.  Yeah, Frank DeFrauner.  You think you know him?  Yes, I think we sat together in the plastic surgeon's office. 
[00:47:30]  Oh, God, we got to get that.  Absolutely.  Can't smile.  Ugh.  What a grump.  Do you know how many times people come up and say,  cheer up, little boy, and I'd say, but I'm very happy.  Does the family just get pissed and not give him presents anymore or do anything for him  because he can't show the happiness and appreciation?  You give him a present.  Does he like it?  Does he hate it?  I remember one time the Santa bounced me on his lap, 
[00:48:00]  and I told him what I wanted, and he said,  why don't you smile, faggot?  That's a mean Santa.  It sure is.  Should have patted you on your little head.  We really got to get a hold of that audio.  That is great.  Oh, of course.  We'll have it for tomorrow's show.  I want to know how many beatings this guy caught from his family because he wasn't smiling.  Smile.  What's wrong with you, you little ingrate when he was growing up?  Happy birthday.  Stupid frown plastic on his face.  Just sitting there with that dopey pointy party hat on and no smile. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, God.  I think I annoy the hell out of everybody around him.  What's wrong with the cake?  No, it's delicious.  Is it?  Can't tell.  Look, I got your favorite thing that you've been asking for this all year.  Thank you.  How about a grin or something?  How about some appreciation, young man?  And you'd say it like this.  Appreciation.  Appreciation.  By the way, you said Santa Claus.  Is there a happy Santa Claus out there? 
[00:49:00]  Find me one.  They're all just bitter.  The real one, Opie, for the children that are listening,  the real Santa is a happy one.  That's right.  The rest of them are actually Santa's helpers that dress like Santa  so they can kind of spread his warmth and cheer and represent him where he can't be  because he's busy building little toys for all the kids.  And there was a little thing where Rudolph got his throat cut by a hunter. 
[00:49:30]  And that didn't happen.  He must lead the sleigh on the snowy night.  His red nose gave him away and a hunter shot him and then bled him out by the throat  and then made venison burgers and stew and things of that ilk.  I don't think that happened.  That's exactly what happened.  That did not happen.  The dead deer carcass is on the roof of the car. 
[00:50:00]  I heard he was hit by a car and the gentleman got out and called and said he needed a bambolance  quickly because there's a deer in his backseat.  I need a bambolance.  A bambolance.  Could be one of the funniest calls ever.  Yeah.  Hey, just a quickie, Tyra.  It's sweeps week, so all the TV shows just getting nuts with what they're doing on TV.  Fatsuit, what's she do?  No, Tyra, man, you know, we...  Giving away ice cubes?  We can't stand Tyra. 
[00:50:30]  We just can't.  She's an Oprah rip-off.  She just stinks.  But for some reason she's getting massive ratings and they think she's doing a good job.  But you can't deny that.  Wow.  She's a hot piece of ass.  Look at her in her lingerie in the New York Post today.  That's in the Post?  Yeah.  Tyra makes audience stripped down.  See, Tyra...  It's all about her.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Because, come on, how are you competing?  See, we're pushing...  Marge from Little Shelter is asking Cleveland for donations. 
[00:51:00]  How is that?  That story is making Cleveland?  All right, we'll get into that a little later, Anthony.  We've been shoving Tyra down people's throats for months and I just don't think the people...  Our fine listeners are getting it.  But Tyra does a TV show every day and makes it about herself all the time.  So, she's doing this show where she forced the audience to strip down to their skivvies.  Yeah.  And there's Tyra on stage looking like a hot piece of ass and then you got the frumpy housewives in the audience looking all slobby and stuff in their underwear. 
[00:51:30]  And they're sitting in their underwear in the audience.  But it's just another excuse for Tyra to make it about her.  Like, look at how hot...  Look how much better I look!  Look at how hot I am compared to you.  Boy, I don't like...  Well, I guess you can guess.  What?  What I don't like on her.  You don't like the fact that she's black, obviously.  No, it's...  But besides that...  Don't say that in front of Sam. 
[00:52:00]  Sam's here in the studio.  We all know you hate blacks.  No, that is not true.  That is not true.  Besides her skin tone, let's just pass on that.  There's something on her body you don't like?  Yeah.  Look, actually, her face is looking a little funny in that picture, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt.  Wait, there's really something you don't like?  Yeah.  Her feet?  Yep.  What's wrong with her feet?  They're size 100.  Look at the size of those feet. 
[00:52:30]  And they're real, like, skinny and big.  Like, skinny, big feet.  They're narrow.  God.  Look at her shoes.  They're like...  You know what, though?  Lewis and Clark paddled those shoes.  You know what?  Nothing?  A little history joke?  I actually...  People have no culture.  I'm actually...  I am not paying attention, as one of us never does.  What the hell was the Lewis and Clark thing?  I missed it.  I'm not saying it again.  You don't want to know. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, listen to the replay.  I will not repeat that, Jimmy.  I heard it.  You are not getting me.  I heard it.  I just really wanted to hear it.  Of course you did.  We're on to you.  Did you see when I had to repeat the joke earlier that you actually liked?  Yeah, but that was funny.  And I repeated it with half the confidence I had when I first said it.  You get me in such a tizzy.  There's nothing better than when a joke bombs if you can get somebody to plow through it again with a newfound confidence.  That really is funny.  Because what happens is you've just driven into a wall and you're getting someone to back up their beaten up car and then slam on the gas again. 
[00:53:30]  Right into the wall again.  So, really fast.  First of all, for the women out there, when Anthony or any guy says, you know, what I don't like about this picture or whatever, and we have to go all the way down to the feet, you're in a good position.  I'm nitpicking.  You're nitpicking because it was so obvious.  I quickly went from head to toe and it was so obvious there was nothing else wrong with Tyra.  Yeah.  Unless she talks, then that's the big problem. 
[00:54:00]  Her head is a bit oval-ish, though.  She has a very big forehead.  She has a definitely a head that looks like an almond.  She has an almond-shaped skull.  You know what I would like to do?  I would like to chop off her head and her feet.  Yeah.  And then what's left with, I will take and ravage.  She's got fantastic natural big boobies.  She's lovely.  She's, you know what, I'm obsessed with her.  I take a peek at her show every chance I could get. 
[00:54:30]  And she's looking more and more like RuPaul every day, though.  She's got a little RuPaul hat.  Is it the...  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  Sorry to turn you on.  Two days in a row.  China yesterday and now a RuPaul mention.  Jesus.  Is it her head?  That big head?  No, it's just how she's wearing her hair and her makeup.  It's kind of like how RuPaul used to do it.  You know, she's looking kind of RuPaul-ish.  But anyway, this is what Tyra's doing.  And we don't have to spend a lot of time on this, but there was just one comment in the post. 
[00:55:00]  And we've got to talk about it for a second here.  Tyra makes audience stripped down.  Always wear...  This is what I have a problem with, okay?  Tyra makes audience stripped down.  Always wear clean underwear because you never know when Tyra Banks will ask you to strip down to your skivvies.  Yeah, well, you always heard the old always wear clean underwear.  So if you get into an accident...  Thank you.  And they have to take your pants off, you're not embarrassed in the hospital.  No one ever challenges this.  Who the F wears dirty underwear?  Ever.  Andrew. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, all right.  Tippy Tom.  Homeless guy.  Oh, okay.  You mean big A.  Excluding big A?  Yes.  But they talk about this like it's an option when you wake up.  Like, hmm, clean underwear or should I wear the dirty pair that's been hanging out?  Dirty underwear.  Hanging out in the hamper for the last week.  Who wears dirty underwear?  Um, not me.  And if you're an EMT, do you really give a crap if someone's not wearing...  I'm sure they do.  ...clean underwear?  You would love to think that those guys are saintly, that people in hospitals are saints 
[00:56:00]  and don't look at people differently if their clothing is a little dirty or something.  But they don't want to deal with stink people.  Yeah.  They don't want to deal...  Remember, I just talked about my yearly medical exam that I had.  I had a full physical.  Went to the doctor, but I had to leave here and rush home to shower first and change my  clothes before I went to the doctor because I didn't want to be stinky guy at the checkup 
[00:56:30]  where he's got to check your prostate and I hadn't showered.  You wanted to look hot for your doctor.  Absolutely not.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  He's an older gentleman.  You're trying to put on your snug BVDs.  You know what?  You know what I give my doctor when I know he's got to check my prostate?  What?  And do the little finger test?  What?  I go to the gym for an hour.  Oh.  How do you like them apples?  He's a workout heart.  Treadmill for an hour.  Treadmill.  That's right.  I have a smoothie and then I go home.  I start, but I don't finish.  I'm like, you know what?  Let him deal with it. 
[00:57:00]  That's right.  That's my attitude.  If he's going to do what he's doing to me, he's going to get a little special treat.  Let Dr. Busybody deal with it an hour.  Halfway through you.  Let it slam shut like the Enterprise elevator doors.  Snap it off.  I eat grapes.  I eat grapes and whole milk.  Yeah.  For an hour before I work out.  Mm-hmm.  That gets the gases going.  Treadmill for an hour.  Full tracksuit in the sauna for an hour.  How do you like them apples?  Sauna.  That's right. 
[00:57:30]  And then I go to the doctor.  I don't really think your doctor would give you an adequate examination.  I don't care.  He would just hold his nose, come over for a second, feel your glands under your neck and  go, okay, you're good.  You leave.  Dude, I don't shower for my doctor.  Why?  When I lay on my side, when he's got to do that, he's like, oh, he's laying on your side  and lower your trousers.  I'll take my trousers off and I lay on my side and I lift my left leg and prop it up  on the wall like I'm trying to be sexy.  That's right.  Courtesy.  I'm obscenely sexy with the doctor.  I'm obscenely hot. 
[00:58:00]  Sexy.  How about the doctor gives us a little courtesy and uses the pinky?  That's courtesy.  You know, for some reason, he can't feel the proper glands and organs and whatnot with  a pinky.  Yeah, right.  That would be a great doctor.  A doctor with a pinky that's about six feet long.  As long as his index finger.  That way he can use that without really being as invasive.  As a thumb. 
[00:58:30]  I'd call my doctor while he's doing it.  I got my foot up on the wall.  I'm like, is that the best you got?  I have lipstick on.  I lean over my shoulder.  I really give him the business.  Painted toenails.  Painted toenails.  I demand that he does the test again with the other hand just to make sure we're getting  everything right.  Really fast.  Let's go to Craig on Long Island.  Craig.  Hello.  Let's go, Craig.  Hey, man.  Speak.  Hi, Craig.  You're on the air.  Speak.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Good. 
[00:59:00]  What's up?  Nothing much.  I just wanted to bring up a little incident that I had personally with the dirty underwear  in the doctor's office.  Yeah.  I went in for a physical exam and on the car ride on the way there, I let one squeak in  the car and I didn't really think that it was going to be one of those questionable  ones.  And it was.  Oh, no.  Nice.  A little more than just a gaseous matter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There was a little something extra there and the doctor got to see it and it was a little  uncomfortable.  That is horrid. 
[00:59:30]  I got the hell out of there and never went back to that doctor.  You know what I do when I'm in the doctor's and I do this?  I wear crotchless underpants and I prop my one foot up against them and I talk like Mae  West over my shoulder at them.  I'm like, what took you so long, big boy?  To come up and see me sometime.  Why don't you get over here and check me for everything?  I wink at him.  I give him an over the top wink, a little stinky wink.  That must be an uncomfortable situation in your doctor's office.  But I make funny noises like when he checks, like I'll ask him to rub and check me for breast 
[01:00:00]  cancer and he'll go, but that's not what we do.  I'll just say, just check me.  And when he's rubbing my chest, I go.  I'm really bad with being ticklish too.  Like I can't deal with being touched in certain places.  Please tell me you're giggling.  Dude, I was freaking.  I was giggling like an idiot when he's touching me, like in places only your doctor or your 
[01:00:30]  girlfriend is supposed to touch you, and I was giggling like a dork.  I really am an ass, and I was giggling.  You certainly were, but it wasn't because you were ticklish.  It was because somewhere in the dark recesses, you remember when it wasn't a doctor who was  doing it.  You remember?  For some reason, when the doctor's doing it, you smell paint thinner, and then you have  visions of being inside a van, and then you're just back to being Anthony Eaton cotton candy.  I'll be honest with you.  There are certain areas around the groin area, like that the doctor checks because there's 
[01:01:00]  glands there, like where your leg meets your torso, like in the fold area where your leg  bends, that they have to feel.  He takes two fingers and kind of presses and feels around.  That I cannot handle.  I was just like an idiot.  I'm a grown man, and I'm giggling because I'm being touched.  Were you giggling because you were embarrassed at the physical reaction that was obvious to 
[01:01:30]  everyone in the room?  There was no physical reaction.  Ha, ha, ha.  Except, like, why?  Also, the doctor goes, oh, what do we got here?  Oh, he did not.  I was, I'm just very ticklish when I'm touched there.  That spot in me is completely ticklish.  Anthony showers before he goes to the doctor.  I was, dude, like three days in advance, I made sure I was, like, clean as a whistle so no chafing 
[01:02:00]  would develop anywhere.  Like, like, uh, using the baby wipe things.  Ew, why?  What is he, what is he, what is he wearing?  Because I don't want to.  Do you wear gloves or, like, little sandpaper hand coverings?  I don't want to be, like, the guy next time you come in, it's like, oh, here comes dirty  guy.  Because, you know, they talk around the office, all over, chatty Kathy, the nurses, and the  receptionist and everything.  Oh, here comes that stinky guy, or the guy that the doctor doesn't like singing because 
[01:02:30]  of that.  You are a psychopath.  And I think you get better, I think you get better personal attention from a doctor.  Uh, he'll spend more time, uh, uh, talking to you about things than a dirty guy.  Do you think that, I have to say, and I very rarely will think you're a psychopath, but  wow, do you think that doctors stand around and go, do you see the body on that cumia?  No, I don't know.  I don't know.  It wasn't quite what I was expecting.  He's a little dirtier than I had hoped.  I mean, like, being dirty guy.  You are nuts.  You are going nuts.  Going nuts.  Let me tell you something. 
[01:03:00]  Your same doctor has to look at, like, grandma's.  Horrible things.  Horrible things.  I don't want to be one of the horrible things.  They don't give a crap if you come in sweaty.  They get their job done.  I think it's a courtesy.  And you're not going to get special attention.  I don't mean special attention.  I just mean he'll be willing to do a more thorough job and talk to you more.  Dude, that guy, doctors know like that.  If you got it or if you don't.  He went to medical school.  He's not expecting to be all good.  They're bored. 
[01:03:30]  So you should say, I should just go in there dirty?  Dude, you know what you should do next time?  I'm going to do this if I had the guts.  Yeah.  Cover yourself in a woman's perfume.  And I mean, like, everywhere on your body, spray a woman's perfume.  And then just paint your toenails and fingernails and never acknowledge it.  Am I trying to dodge the draft?  And never say a word about it.  Never say a word about it.  Or make a silly face on your ass.  Put an eye on each cheek.  And we all know what the mouth is.  It's fine. 
[01:04:00]  There was a girl actually at the Hammerstein.  She had me sign her butt cheeks.  And she had an eye tattooed on each one.  It was so sexy.  Because she had a really nice hiney.  But it was really bizarre.  That's sexy?  Yeah.  On her it was.  Because she had a great ass.  She could have had anything tattooed.  All right.  Hey.  All right.  Let's go to Jill.  And then we'll take a break here.  Let's say hi to Jill.  Yeah.  Jill, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  Hi, Jill.  I'm actually a nurse in an emergency room.  And I have to tell you that when people come in with, and it's not only just from the 
[01:04:30]  accident, when they come in with some skid marks.  Yeah.  It's sometimes like, you know, underwear they probably had on for a week.  And it generally, it can be young or old.  Uh-huh.  And we do notice.  And it's disgusting.  And we have to take them off.  Yeah, but you still do.  You do notice.  It's disgusting.  Now, let me tell you something.  Without, now, I know you're not going to neglect somebody because they have skid marks and  stuff, but aren't you a little more, aren't you a little more courteous to somebody that  is kind of more well-kempt than somebody that's coming in with skid marks? 
[01:05:00]  Unfortunately, we have to give more attention to somebody who's, you know, filthy, sweaty,  and all over, you know.  So they're wrecking it for clean people.  Absolutely.  You know.  All right.  Thank you, Jill.  You're getting a chintzy examination.  The doctor's not even looking at your blood work.  He's like, ah, he takes care of himself.  He's fine.  Great.  Anthony wants to be noticed.  He wants to be noticed.  He wants the doctor talking about him around the office and going, that guy smelled terrific.  I don't want to be dirty.  No chafing?  You're kidding me.  I don't want to be dirty guy or, you know, dirty, hangy guy or stinky. 
[01:05:30]  Dude, go in there with a swamp ass, man.  No, you can't.  You'll get the same attention.  Yeah, you will.  Yeah, you will.  I cannot believe you two.  Oh, I can't.  I can't get enough of it.  Then you know it's just business.  Because I wonder about my doctor.  It is business.  I have to find a new doctor because every time I go in there with a little scratchy throat,  I'm bending over for the guy.  So something's going on with my doctor. 
[01:06:00]  Scratchy throat.  And that's where...  Let's not go through.  And that's where I came up with the swamp ass theory.  It's the scratchy throat after the exam.  I'm going in there very, very filthy.  So we get right down to business and see why I have a scratchy throat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm teasing my doctor.  It's obvious.  Cynthia, what's up?  Your blonde hair, your blue eyes, your mouth opens.  He just has to see more.  Cynthia.  Cynthia.  Yes.  Hey.  I also agree. 
[01:06:30]  I mean, we go and we see female doctors all the time.  Yeah.  And, you know, like you're saying thing.  You want to not stink when her face is down there or his face is down there.  Right.  And so if you do clean it up and they get down there, they kind of like hang and stay.  They're getting the tools.  Their face is like right there.  And you're like, okay, how long are you going to stay down there?  Yeah.  You're giving the doctor an opportunity to hang out down there a little too long, Anthony. 
[01:07:00]  No, no.  You never know the sexual orientation of your doctor.  Did you ever just feel this?  A little breath?  No, I didn't.  I'll bet you that's what happened.  Anthony, like it got really quiet during an exam and Anthony heard.  I did not.  Why can't I be courteous to my doctor?  Being courteous is one thing, but you're actually going.  That's why, because they hang down there too long. 
[01:07:30]  They do hang down there, man.  Why don't you tell us?  No, we know that they hang down there.  Down there too long.  Is she from Philly or Baltimore?  I like Cynthia.  Where are you from?  I like her too.  I'm from Jersey.  South Jersey, right?  Yep.  Oh, wait.  I got another one for you too.  It smells like...  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  Taser.  Her underwear, a little stained.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We got Tenacious D coming in.

Scott, what's up? 
[01:09:30]  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Scott.  Oh, I just want to tell you, I think of the FHM with your article inside.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it was delightful.  Especially enjoyed the picture of little Jimmy Norton as he waited with anticipation  for the slices of turkey that you two had prepared.  Didn't I look like a little boy waiting for my parents to hand me a piece of turkey?  I love that one picture of us three.  Yeah, I do too.  Yeah.  I really do. 
[01:10:00]  It's me stabbing the turkey.  Anthony's like, I guess you're holding the turkey?  Yes, I'm presenting the turkey.  Or you got the fork.  I don't know.  And then Jimmy is there in anticipation of a slice of juicy turkey with his bib on and  his plate all the way up to his chin.  He's open wide.  Yeah.  I'm in the middle just for more goodies like the leech that I am.  Like just a back-breaking leech.  They did a really good job.  It's the latest issue of FHM Magazine, the December issue.  How he had to, you know, make fun of it because he has to make fun of whatever we do. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  No honesty whatsoever there.  But whatever.  We're proud of the article.  We're proud of the pictures.  And you can check it out for yourself, the December issue of FHM.  Thanks, Scott.  No problem.  Bye, sweet potato.  All right, we got the news tease.  We were just talking about this.  The kid that can't smile.  They're going to do it on the news tonight.  Got the tease?  Yeah, it's pretty funny.  Today at 5, can burning a candle in your ear improve your health?  Hear from people who swear by it.  Plus, imagine going through life unable to smile. 
[01:11:00]  One man's battle to show his pearly whites.  Join Chris Raggi and Christine Johnson.  Today, CBS 2 News starting at 5.  Wouldn't it be funny if he admitted, like, there's something wrong with me because I frown all  the time until I read about things like drunk driving deaths and murders, and then I smile.  He's a despicable human being.  He has a medical condition called he's a creep.  I can't wait to see that tonight, later on. 
[01:11:30]  All right.  Yeah, get the details.  Yeah.  Just cut his lips off.  There.  There's his pearly whites.  Now you're smiling all the time, stupid.  We got to go back to Cleveland.  Jeremy in Cleveland.  What's up?  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey, man.  I just wanted to let you know that Marge from your little shelter there is trying to get  donations from here, too.  She's featured on the website here, newsnet5.com.  Yeah.  Marge from the little shelter.  She calls here occasionally.  The little shelter is a place that takes in dogs and kitties and stuff, and they don't 
[01:12:00]  kill them, allegedly.  What about those close-to-lead dogs that were born?  Yeah, I was getting to that, you dumbass.  Jesus, let me set up who Marge is.  Jeremy knows who Marge is, so he assumes everybody does.  I'm right in the middle of explaining who Marge is, and he just starts telling the story  of why Marge is in the news.  Jeremy, we are using you as a setup.  Right, you're a setup.  That's it.  And then you stop talking. 
[01:12:30]  That's right.  That's how it works.  You're only good for the setup.  You adult.  Not to join in the conversation.  Right.  You set it up.  You don't do the slam dunk.  You do the pass.  And perhaps he could have added in something later if he would have just held on and shut  up.  Instead, he got teased.  Shaddy Kathy.  He wants to jump in and be a butt-in-tee.  That's right.  Well, Marge from the little shelter calls us, and she's always trying to get money.  Always trying to get money from us, our listeners, everything else, for the little shelter. 
[01:13:00]  The little place that takes care of dogs and cats.  And she was on the news, I heard on 1010 Winds, on our local news here in New York, that two  little puppies were born, and who even knew this was possible, with cleft palates, little  hair-lipped dogs, born with cleft palates so they can't eat.  Oh, just get rid of them.  What, does she need donations for steel-toed boots to take care of this problem?  Just get rid of them. 
[01:13:30]  There is, you know...  Thank God they still have the death penalty in the animal community.  I, uh...  They still use it.  I'm amazed at the, at us as a country.  I really am.  Sometimes I come off a little liberal.  See?  Sometimes I do.  What?  I do.  Occasionally.  Because I think that there's better use for money that would go to cleft palated puppies  than to give it to cleft palated puppies. 
[01:14:00]  Perhaps, you know, people like, uh, our own, uh, Andrew, I earned those puppies.  I earned that.  You know, perhaps, uh, he could use some, some cash.  Yeah.  There are plenty of other causes than cleft palated puppies.  Not even like dogs where they've been around for a while and, you know, they're connected  to a family.  They're brand new puppies.  Who's gonna miss them?  Stupid Marge.  That's who.  There's no reason to keep these puppies alive. 
[01:14:30]  I'm sorry.  That's my take on this.  Why?  They're so cute.  Oh, I know.  They are monster dogs.  Look, their names are Magic and Merlin.  How could you not love them?  Yeah.  Let's adopt these, uh, disasters.  Their names should be Punch and a Bull.  Uh, yeah.  Let's see.  Uh, Magic and Merlin.  Puppies born with cleft palates that prevent them from feeding themselves are in need of 
[01:15:00]  a miracle.  Your time with the dog feeding it?  Well, that's what they've been doing at the little shelter.  They've made a public appeal for donations of a veterinarian service to correct the pup's  deformity.  Oh, I guess they want a donation of a veterinarian services.  So they're not asking for money to pay for this?  All right.  I'm wrong then.  They gotta feed them through a tube every three hours.  Every three hours, some adult has to shove a tube down one of these things' throats  and feed it and pump some puppy chow down there.  They need to be petted. 
[01:15:30]  They're cute.  No, they are not cute.  They are horrific monsters.  They are what we like to call abominations.  They have little cleft dog palates.  And Marge and the gang rescued the puppies from a New York City shelter, which she declined  to identify when it became clear they would be killed.  Killed because, uh, you know what Marge says.  I don't like the word euthanized because that's too nice.  They were going to be killed.  You know what it would be fun to do to these little puppies?  Put peanut butter on both halves of their cleft palate. 
[01:16:00]  And watch them.  Never see a dog try to lick peanut butter off the roof of its mouth?  Watch these.  It would get stuck in the groove and come out their nostrils.  The fun you could have with dogs with cleft palates scaring the children.  Yeah, they'd go for a cute little puppy and there's just this deformed, dumb mouth looking at them.  Leaves bite marks on your arm like something out of a horror movie.  Looks like Predator Attack.  The hell were you bit by?  Oof! Oof! Oof! 
[01:16:30]  Come here! Come here, puppy!  Oof! Oof!  Oh, is that your dog? He's so...  Oof!  Oof!  They need homes, too.  Nah.  I gotta be the voice of the animal lovers out there.  No, you don't.  Yes, I do.  They need a ditch, some kerosene, and a match. 
[01:17:00]  Where's Marge?  Give him home his little shoe boxes.  We need Marge.  I heard the little fella moving around for a while.  That's good.  You go to scratch under his chin, and your finger slips up into his sinuses.  Little doggy sinuses.  Oof! Oof! Oof!  It's a horrific story.  Oh, boy.  Canana.  Cananida.  I almost said Cananida. 
[01:17:30]  Cananida.  Canada Chris.  Are you in?  Canada Chris has to be an implant from the States, because he can't be this funny.  He just can't.  Funny people don't come from Canada.  Ooh.  He's from Halifax.  Fed by a tube every three hours, the pups should be named Christopher and Reeves.  That's horrible.  Make fun of your own Canadian celebrities that are dead. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Not ours.  Yeah.  Boston.  So, yeah.  So, I was driving in this morning, and I heard Marge making an appeal on the news.  We love Marge.  Do we have the audio?  Jimmy's just looking.  Jimmy.  Oh!  His finger slips into his skin.  Oh.  Just, you pull out some, I don't know what, goopy mucus membrane.  That's adorable.  What can, and they can fix this? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah, I guess the vet can, sure.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  Yeah.  Why hasn't Marge called?  Because, oh, she's getting publicity everywhere else?  Yeah.  You got it?  Probably put some milk on our tongue unless cleft palate dogs suck it off.  Yeah, the vet could fix the cleft palate, but he couldn't fix Fresca.  Poor Fresca.  Fresca!  Opie's little doggy Fresca.  You know the dog named Fresca?  Not an awful name for a dog, by the way.  Yeah.  We named our dogs after sodas. 
[01:19:00]  What's wrong with that?  Nothing if it's Coke or Pepsi.  Yeah.  I had a Sprite, I had a Fresca, I had a Pepsi.  Come here, RC Cola.  I had a...  Ew.  Trying to think of the one that got ran over.  Meister, bro?  Diet Pepsi.  All right, we got to break in here.  We're waiting for Marge to hopefully call to give us an update.  Marge Stein.  Huh?  It's her name.  It's in the paper.  Oh, really?  Little shelter spokeswoman, Marge Stein.  I guess she doesn't need us anymore.  She's getting the big publicity now. 
[01:19:30]  I heard her talking on the news station.  I was like, oh my God.  We got breaking news.  Windsor's ripping us off.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo, Robin.  We got breaking news.  Breaking news.  This is a Fox News alert on this Wednesday morning.  A six-and-a-half-foot tsunami wave is expected to be hitting the northern and eastern coast of Japan,  if not now, very shortly.  It comes after a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit earlier this morning. 
[01:20:00]  The country of Japan telling folks in the region to get to higher ground if they are on the northern shore,  the eastern shore of Japan.  Six-and-a-half feet higher.  Oh, Japan.  Get six-and-a-half feet higher.  Just find a basketball player and stand on his shoulders.  Or get four of you and stand on each other's shoulders.  Sacrifice.  At least one of you can live there.  Yeah, sacrifice.  Three out of the four.  Four.  Wow.  I wonder if our old producer Rick Delgado is penning a little tune.  As we speak. 
[01:20:30]  So we got the big earthquake in the ocean around Japan.  7.8.  That's a biggie.  That's pretty big.  And now they're talking about a six-and-a-half.  Six-and-a-half-foot tsunami.  I don't think people...  Well, if we get an expert, I'm sure they could tell us that.  Yeah, it's not just like a six-and-a-half-foot high wave.  It means that the water level rises six-and-a-half feet, which can flood a lot of the areas, I gather.  I don't know.  I have a mic in front of me.  I felt I was an authority.  Well, no.  A six-and-a-half-foot actually is... 
[01:21:00]  The problem is it's actually much worse than the six-foot.  But they said, thank God, it's not the seven-foot variety.  Is that what they said?  I didn't hear that part of the broadcast.  I heard that before.  Japan.com.  I got to say hi to Harry.  Harry!  Good morning, Opie, man.  I just called Exchange Pleasantry to see how the worlds are treating you.  Yeah, I got to explain to everybody.  When I took a couple days off last week, I went up to Rochester.  Brother Wee's my mentor.  He had a big birthday, and they did a whole roasting thing for him. 
[01:21:30]  And I was up there doing radio.  And Harry...  I always picture Brother Wee's hanging out in, like, Obi-Wan Kenobi's little get-up when you call him your mentor.  He is my mentor.  You picture him with a lightsaber.  Before I met him, I was trying to get that radio voice together.  Were you?  Oh, yeah.  I wanted to be...  I didn't know what I wanted to be.  Boss jock.  Yeah, I guess I wanted to be a boss jock.  Boss jock.  And then I heard Wee's with this awful voice just babbling.  And I said, yeah, that's what I want to do, too.  All right. 
[01:22:00]  That looks easier.  Yeah.  I'll do that.  Yeah, you know, I talk about how he really showed me the way.  No, the reality is, he showed me an easier way.  You mean you don't have to speak perfectly, and you don't have to have a good voice to be on the radio?  All right.  I don't need a train anymore.  Take that gig.  But I was up there for a couple days last week, and Harry was sitting in Brother Wee's studio,  and I couldn't get enough of this guy.  Harry's from North Carolina.  Opie, I think you would dick on wheels, too, okay?  You think...  Now, listen.  Yeah. 
[01:22:30]  Absolutely.  What a fine-looking lady, if I may bring that up.  Jesus.  Well, Opie's a guy, you idiot.  Yeah.  Granted, I've made the same mistake sometimes.  He raises his arms, and I see that V.  I'm like, who is this?  Who is this, a workout chick that's walked in here?  Damn.  Yeah, you are.  Again, you're luckier than a dog with two dicks, I'm going to say it.  Jesus.  That's absolute truth.  Yeah, I palled around with Harry for a little while, because I can't get enough of this guy.  He does his own... 
[01:23:00]  What does Harry do for a living?  Yeah, what do you do, Harry?  Oh, I own a little business here in North Carolina.  Oh, crystal meth salesman.  Sell some crystal meth.  Now, he called the wrong number one day and got Brother Wee's instead,  and he's been kind of a guy that calls Brother Wee's ever since.  And he never heard of us, Anthony, but he had the XM, so I'm like, Harry, 202, buddy, 202.  And now you've checked it out in North Carolina.  What do you think of the show?  Well, I have checked it out. 
[01:23:30]  I've laughed my ass off, okay?  Yeah.  My boy Jimmy James Norton.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hi, Harry.  You're out of your rabid-ass mind.  Well, thank you.  See, this guy didn't even know who you were two weeks ago.  I had no...  But now he knows your name and everything.  Harry, let me ask you a question.  Had you looked at the, like, you'd flipped around through the XM and looked at the packaging  and saw all the names of the channels and wondered what high voltage was?  I had no idea what you guys were.  Of course.  I went on the nets and, you know, Jesus Christ, you are somebody.  Yeah.  Could have thunk it. 
[01:24:00]  Listen, we were talking about the poor old guy that let the lumpy fart on the way to the doctor.  I did that one time and, really, all you got to do, you don't have to go home and change your drawers.  You just need to put them on backwards.  So that little thing goes there, it works.  I'm telling you.  Harry went to the doctor with swamp ass.  Well, I did.  Just one time, okay?  Dude, I got to tell you.  So I'm in Rochester and, you know, it's basic radio, unfortunately.  Radio stinks now. 
[01:24:30]  They have, like, six radio stations on the same floor of this office building.  So you could walk just the hall and all of a sudden you go from, you know, what Brother Weezer is doing, which is some great radio, to, like, you know, wimpy rock, to alternative rock, to, like, hip-hop, all on the same floor.  So I drag Harry into the radio station we're on in Rochester, The Zone.  Yeah.  And they're playing when we're not on the air, really cool stuff, you know?  And I got Harry in there with the midday girl and she's just hating him because he has no clue about the bands or anything. 
[01:25:00]  We're just messing up her show.  So, you know, we're asking about some of the current bands of the day and he has no idea.  Yeah, something tells me he doesn't.  But it made for great radio, but I don't know if she really understood why that was good radio.  Right, Harry?  That old girl had the personality of a water buffalo.  I wouldn't hit a good-sized dog at the ass with her.  Yeah, there you go.  Whatever that means.  I bet he kills them around the swamp.  Like when they gather around.  All right, Harry, we got to take a break.  Noodling. 
[01:25:30]  Bicycle.  All right, you call in from time to time, all right, Harry?  Oh, he says bicycle.  I said don't let your meatloaf.  Oh, boy.  That's why.  Don't let your meatloaf.  All right, Harry.  Stand to your weenie roast.  Opie, hang in there, brother.  I'm glad you checked out the show and I'm glad you like it.  It's a hoot.  All right.  I'll give you a call back.  All right, call anytime, Harry.  Thanks.  How long?  Why didn't the Civil War take a week?  It should have taken a week.  I love that guy, though.  Can't get enough of Harry. 
[01:26:00]  I can.  And I'm sure others are saying the same thing, Jimmy.  But that's why I like him.  I think I had enough.  Yeah.  It's funny.  You said that.  And then after, like, the first sentence, I'm like, wow, that's funny.  You may not be able to get enough of him.  But, my God, I've had my fill of Harry.  You know what?  Now that I know that, I'm going to torture you and get him on every day.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.

[01:27:00]  Dirty deed, man, they're done dirty.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Breaking news on CNN.  I swear to God.  They're going nuts.  You've probably heard by now.  Earthquake in the ocean.  Off the coast of Japan.  Tsunami warning.  CNN reporting a 16-inch wave has hit Japan.  Opie, Opie, you must mean 16-foot wave. 
[01:27:30]  No.  You said inch by mistake.  Couldn't possibly be reporting a 16-inch wave.  Look, we're no experts.  We understand that.  And maybe there's a meteorologist out there getting really pissed off.  But CNN, breaking news.  Big graphic saying 16-inch wave has hit Japan.  Uh, so?  Well, I think that they said that the responsible, it wasn't an earthquake, it was two kids frolicking. 
[01:28:00]  And are we going to be able to tell if it's, uh, if, uh, if they're worried over there?  Yeah, I know.  Are they happy, sad, worried, scared?  Who knows?  Are they getting ready for a birthday party?  Or is that the look because there's a tsunami coming?  Cataclysmic event.  You figure it out because we can't.  One or the other.  Let's say hi to Cigars and Scotch.  Cigars and Scotch, what's up?  Hey, good morning.  I know the wave hasn't hit yet. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  But I'm pretty sure you guys have audio of it.  Yeah?  Hmm.  Let's, uh, check our audio.  Are you talking about this?  Since we got that.  Is Cigars and Scotch setting me up for a bit?  Could be.  Are you talking about this audio?  Are you talking about this audio? 
[01:29:00]  And there you go. 
[01:29:30]  We're still trying to figure out, believe it or not, what that is.  Yeah.  No one has gotten it right yet, Anthony.  What the hell is it?  We've been playing that off and on for three or four days now.  Not one right answer to what that is.  By the way, Big Duties, Jay.  And if you want to guess on what that is, yes, you can call the show.  Big Duties, Jay, from Jersey.  Doing it in my voice here, but he wrote it.  He says, stupid Japan.  Even their tsunamis are short. 
[01:30:00]  But they're reporting 16-inch tall wave has hit Japan.  16-inch.  Wow.  I don't know what that means.  Nothing.  It means nothing.  It really doesn't sound that devastating.  They took on Godzilla and won.  I think they can handle a 16-inch wave.  If your town is wiped out by a wave that's a foot and a half high,  maybe your town didn't need to be there.  Yeah.  Maybe Darwin was right. 
[01:30:30]  There's no, like, maybe they should get people on to explain why a 16-inch wave would be devastating.  It's like rain.  It can rain that much.  Well, their houses are made out of balsa wood, so.  Well, we know that.  Actually, rolling papers and sticks.  Yeah.  You've got those paper walls.  Yeah.  Well, they say this is going to be devastating to Japan's worm community.  And also, lawn jockeys are being swept away. 
[01:31:00]  I mean, it's really going to be tragic.  It does sound devastating.  The daffodil industry might not survive.  The daffodils will not come back.  Yeah, a lot of concern out there.  Let's go to Bob in Brooklyn.  He makes a very, very good point here, or he's got a good question.  Yes, Bob?  I just want to know if this damn thing is going to stop me from getting my PS3.  Ah, at least your priorities are straight.  Bravo to Bob.  All right, we got a quickie, but someone drink tsunami water. 
[01:31:30]  Well, people don't realize that what's going to really happen is that there's going to be a lot of bonsai trees that drown in this disaster.  Right.  The little Japanese trees.  They're very tiny, and a 16-inch wave could be devastating to the bonsai tree industry.  When I see a bonsai tree, I want to snap it and throw the both halves into whoever's face or the person that grew it.  Snap it and throw it in their face. 
[01:32:00]  But they spent a lot of time shaping that, Jimmy.  I thought you wanted to throw it down in a ditch so Mr. Miyagi and Daniel-san would have to go down and get it and mend it.  No, I would only throw one half in the ditch, and the other half I would back over.  So even if they get the good half in the ditch, they have a half a bonsai tree and nothing to match it with.  Why don't you morph that with a cleft-palate puppy?  See what you get, scumbag.  Yeah, we can't get Marge on the phone.  Stupid Marge is all busy today.  Can you believe that?  Marge is too busy for our show today. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  She's becoming a big star.  Yeah.  Isn't it a bonsai tree, broccoli?  Isn't it the same thing?  That's our version.  Is it?  Yeah.  Hey, a quickie, but someone remind me, we've got to get this over to XM Uncensored, okay?  Mm-hmm.  I watched a new documentary that's, oh, a tsunami update?  Oh, man.  Oh, an update.  All right, hold on.  Thank you.  Oh, no.  Hold on.  No, there's a new documentary coming out on the word, the F word.  Can't say it over here.  I understand that.  Which is pretty interesting.  I enjoyed it, but yes, Jim. 
[01:33:00]  There's a new tsunami update.  They're saying now that the problem is going to be that welcome mats are being taken away  from homes and winding up in different places.  Wow.  Yeah.  And a potted plant has been knocked over.  I don't know.  Let's just hope that people are okay.  A woman was spotted standing on a kitchen chair to avoid the wave.  You know, I want to start a charity for, yeah, to raise money for people that lost linoleum 
[01:33:30]  floors.  Linoleum?  In this, yes.  How about the paper walls?  Well, they use linoleum.  Or grass mat.  What do they use on their floors?  We don't know crap about it, man.  We have milk.  And they're taking over the world.  It's a mysterious country.  Stupid Asians.  They're everywhere now.  You know who's going to win the presidential election here?  Huh?  Barack!  Hey, hey, that's my bit.  What?  No, it's not.  Yeah, it is.  Oh.  Stop.  Giuliani ain't winning it.  Tell you right now.  You don't think so? 
[01:34:00]  I don't know.  He's not a chance.  No.  I think he is.  The whole Republican Party will fall apart.  You watch.  I think he might do well.  Here's the tsunami update.  Lucy Nolan is joining us now with breaking news that we've been following here all morning  long.  Good morning again, Lucy.  Good morning, Ron.  Good morning, Jody.  The Japanese government is now calling a special meeting about the tsunami danger at the Prime  Minister's residence.  It's the breaking news we've been talking about this morning.  Residents along Japan's Pacific coast heading to higher ground.  A very wide area affected stretching down past Tokyo. 
[01:34:30]  An 8.1 quake hit near the northern islands of the country, prompting the warning.  The latest information, a wave of about 16 inches has hit the northernmost island of Hokkaido.  The initial warning, a wave as large as 6 1⁄2 feet could strike Japan's coastal areas.  A tsunami advisory also issued for Hawaii now with a Pacific tsunami warning center says  there is no threat of a destructive wave.  Of course, we'll stay on top of this.  We'll give you the very latest as it continues this morning. 
[01:35:00]  There you go.  A 16-inch wave that now has to head to Hawaii?  What are they worried about?  A little extra beach break or build those sandcastles five feet back?  God, what asses they are.  They just want it to be a 16-foot wave.  They want a huge wave to wash over Japan.  And that's why CNN is reporting it.  I know why they're reporting it.  Because as a viewer, you might quickly go 16.  You would just assume it has to be 16 feet.  Right.  They wouldn't be interrupting regular programs and tell us about a 16-inch wave.  That's why they do it. 
[01:35:30]  Hold on.  This just in.  Ankles were sullied.  Ankles have been sullied in this horrible tsunami that is hitting Japan as we speak.  Not good.  Developing story.  Not good.  Kids crying all over the place because their sandcastles just got destroyed.  Apparently there's footage now on Ogrish.  But an elderly woman was sunbathing and she was knocked to her knees in the surf.  And it's on Ogrish.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Where else are you going to watch something so horrific? 
[01:36:00]  Really upsetting footage.  I just hope some of this doesn't end up on YouTube and places like that where children  can watch and be so disturbed as they just see water coming up and maybe covering a lawn.  It would be horrible.  Yeah.  Devastating.  Yellow grass year, they're going to call this.  All the grass is going to drown.  Got a quickie here.  But remind me, we should play this over at XM where we don't have censorship.  But there's a new documentary out on the F word. 
[01:36:30]  It was very, very entertaining to me.  Yeah, I enjoyed it immensely.  Did the F word really need a documentary?  They try to figure out what is the meaning, where did it come from.  Everyone's got those fallacies of where it comes from.  Yeah, no one really got the right answer.  They don't really have.  For unlawful, carnal knowledge.  That's what they...  It was one of them.  Everyone's warning candy under the consent of the king, which really annoys me.  And you ever get those emails and stuff, the cut and paste emails that are supposed 
[01:37:00]  to be so entertaining?  And it's that garbage, that crap, the urban myth that has been thrown around for years.  No, I wouldn't get them.  Here's why.  FWD colon equals delete.  You send me a forward, it gets deleted.  I don't think about it.  Your forwards are never funny.  No.  You bunch of fat house frows out there.  Hey, hey, hey.  Stop sending them to me.  Hey, they listen to the show and they love us.  Do they really?  No.  Good.  Stop sending me emails. 
[01:37:30]  I hate them.  They're never, ever funny.  And what you learn in the documentary, yeah, all those meanings for the F word are not  true.  The crap.  They're not true.  But then they talk about the FCC and George Carlin's Seven Dirty Words and Lenny Bruce.  It was a pretty good documentary.  I don't think it's for everybody, but it was kind of interesting.  And they have audio from Apollo 17, which happened in December 1972.  And the astronauts are talking to Houston. 
[01:38:00]  And they're cursing up a storm.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So the bleeps will be the F word, obviously, in this piece.  Oh, my God.  Hold on.  Yeah, they are.  What happened?  This out of Japan.  They're beginning to bury flip-flops in mass graves.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Yeah, apparently.  How could we have a joke at a time like this?  Just washed away, and no one knows whose they are, who they belong to.  Yeah.  Just big.  I can't go. 
[01:38:30]  Hey, Bird and Philly, let's put a positive spin on this.  All of the baby turtles on the north coast of Japan have made it to the sea.  Now they made it.  And then Mark from Edison, New Jersey, wouldn't it be funny if they ran from this 16-inch tsunami  and Godzilla effing ate them?  There is no real Godzilla.  Let's see.  That wave will have to commit Harry Carey for failure.  It's a very dishonored wave. 
[01:39:00]  That really was a faggity little non-wave.  Nothing.  Mike from Pittsburgh.  We love Pittsburgh.  We haven't talked about you guys in a while, but we love Pittsburgh.  We're coming your way.  Mike in Pittsburgh.  I've seen waterheads retain more than this stupid wave.  This wave was a bust.  Wave stinks.  What a non-tsunami.  16 inches from a huge earthquake.  Yeah, the news is just hoping it was bigger.  They wanted devastation. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, Rob in New Jersey.  He's got it.  Let's say hi to Rob.  Rob?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  I got a way Japan can protect themselves from the tsunami waves.  Yeah.  One sandbag.  Yeah, one sandbag.  One sandbag.  All right, here's audio from Apollo 17 from December 1972.  Listen for the swears.  Okay, and I sure think it's staying up.  You guys are doing an outstanding job.  I got the parts again.  I've gone away again, Charlie.  I haven't eaten this much citrus fruit in 20 years. 
[01:40:00]  I'll tell you one thing.  In another 12 days, I ain't never eaten anymore.  I put them up over the...  Right up in here.  They ain't there.  What was Al Dukes on the dump button?  They had to remind the guy that they had a hot mic. 
[01:40:30]  The press is listening.  Everyone's listening.  Could you knock it off with the language?  You're an astronaut.  You're only...  Just in the middle of that whole thing, he just goes, F!  Really?  He had it with the citrus fruit and the tang.  But nobody made a big deal about it.  That happened today.  It would be all over the paper.  Is that wrong for astronauts to be talking like that?  They're role models.  That just goes to show you how certain language should be allowed on radio, television,  because it's the way real people talk.  It's the way astronauts talk. 
[01:41:00]  How come the FCC didn't find them?  You can't get much more communicative from space.  Yeah.  Well, that didn't make TV or anything, obviously, but...  No.  Or maybe it did.  But it is the way people speak.  No, it didn't make TV, because it was Apollo 17.  No, by that point, no one cared.  No one cared.  Right.  After 13, with all the residue floating around the ship, people just lost it.  Yeah.  They made it back.  Who cares?  I said, screw it.  Do we have any more audio of astronauts in space? 
[01:41:30]  Oh, my God.  I think there were some tapes.  Yeah.  I heard that they did have some stuff, right?  Uh, yeah.  Uh, you know what the best, uh, thing about the moon is?  Uh.  And now, Ryan, go ahead.  Uh, yeah, uh, there's no...  God damn it.  No breathing?  Yeah, the air just got sucked out of...  F*** that up, didn't I? 
[01:42:00]  Yes, you did.  Son of a...  F***.  F***.  F***.  F***.  Damn it.  Why can't I get my templates right?  Wait, what was the audio?  Yeah, where's the audio?  What are you talking about?  Just...  Uh, the fact this is great, because there's no f*** here.  What?  Air.  Must be.  I mean, uh, air.  Air.  There's no what there.  There's no what there.  That's not an F for it, Bob.  Yeah.  Yeah, but we can't say that either here on the radio.  You know. 
[01:42:30]  Houston, we got a problem.  Holy f***.  Am I horny.  Oh, live mic?  I ain't been late in a while.  Up here on the moon.  Wife's sitting down there.  I got a big f*** on.  Can I say on?  I don't know if it's getting dumped or not.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Screw me up.  Stupid template.  Marked one.  Messed you up. 
[01:43:00]  I hit ten.  What was that, anyway?  Was a breeze.  Damn it.  All right.  Do we have time to do a quickie here before we get Tenacious D on the radio?  Jack and Kyle.  Let's wait until we play the uncensored version over there.  All right.  You'll try it again.  Oh.  Take two on that.  You'll hear it in all its glory.  Yeah.  All right.  Here we go.  I might even say a naughty word.  Ooh.  Can't wait. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  A Southern California couple flying from L.A. to Raleigh felt frisky at 30,000 feet.  Tonight, they are facing mile-high accusations and federal charges.  CBS News' Mary Beth McDade is live at LAX with more.  Mary Beth.  Well, Laura, the couple left here.  We can call it L.A. sex today.  Mile-high allegations.  Hack.  Mile-high allegations.  Mile-high allegations. 
[01:44:00]  The media in this country just stinks.  Well, Laura, the couple left here on a Southwest flight to North Carolina where they were greeted by the police.  Who had a bone to pick with the couple.  Get it?  We're greeted by the police.  The alleged reason being their mid-air public display of affection reached disturbing heights.  Oh, my God.  How many wordplay things is the loop doing?  Enough puns. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, my God.  This story is really crashing and burning.  Stupid whore.  Have some diggity in your job.  Diggity?  Yeah, have some diggity.  That's kind of like dignity, but for cleft-palate humans.  She had my fat mouth smashed.  The nerve of me to try to make a point as I flub.  The couple was in plain sight.  And he came out.  You realize he earned his red wings. 
[01:45:00]  I started the story over.  I want to see how many puns are used in this fine story.  Oh, it's awful.  It stinks.  Yeah, why don't you ring the ding when you hear a pun there, Anthony?  A good pun.  A Southern California couple flying from L.A. to Raleigh felt frisky at 30,000 feet.  Tonight, they are facing mile-high accusations and federal charges.  That's one mile-high.  CBS2's Marybeth McDade is live at LAX with more.  Marybeth.  Well, Laura, the couple left here on a Southwest flight to North Carolina where they were greeted  by the police.  The alleged reason being their mid-air public-to-slave affection reached disturbing heights. 
[01:45:30]  I've heard of those things.  Never saw it, though.  Sounds exciting.  Well, no.  I want to join the mile-high club, so I don't know.  None of the passengers we spoke to at LAX seemed to find the idea of a couple getting  hot and heavy in the air too offensive.  However, all agreed they'd ask them to stop if it was happening right in front of their  eyes.  There were only two?  That is so not true, by the way.  We stink.  We all want to watch people having sex.  Why not?  Why not? 
[01:46:00]  There's a couple getting it on a plane, and you can take a peek.  You're watching.  You're not going, excuse me.  Excuse me.  Stop that.  Where were they doing it, did they say?  I think right in their seat.  Right in their seat?  Yeah.  Must have been one of those big, nice, first-class sleeper seats.  Oh, were they in the seat?  Or were they like, one was an aisle, one was a window, and there was a big, fat guy in  the middle.  He might have been disturbed.  No, the guy was in first, and she was in coach, so they actually had to just like, he  stood at the...  At the curtain?  At the curtain.  And opened the curtain, they were like a Hasidic couple, and she just stood there, kind 
[01:46:30]  of hunched over in coach.  See, I think it would be much hotter if she was in first class, and she had to just bend  her ass into coach.  Back in the coach.  You just see an ass sticking out into coach.  Now that's what I call a snake on a plane.  There's snakes on a plane.  But that would be too nice, actually.  It's much better if he's in first, because he's just sticking through the curtain, and that's  what the people in coach have to look at.  The old peekaboo. 
[01:47:00]  Well, of course, you've got to hear this clip.  Man has chronic illness.  His head was in her lap because he was trying to sleep.  Oh, is that what...  That's the excuse they're using?  That's their defense.  According to a federal indictment, that's exactly what a Southwest flight attendant did when  Carl Persing of Lakewood and Don Sewell of Huntington Beach allegedly engaged in overt  sexual activity.  Hold on. 
[01:47:30]  Yes?  Gay sex.  What?  Carl and Don, right?  Don.  Don?  She just said it with the Don accent, maybe.  According to a federal indictment, that's exactly what a Southwest flight attendant did when  Carl Persing of Lakewood and Don Sewell of Huntington Beach allegedly engaged in overt sexual  activity.  The flight attendant claims he repeatedly asked the couple to stop during a flight bound to  Raleigh dorm from LAX two months ago.  The court documents also say other passengers became uncomfortable with Persing kissing Sewell 
[01:48:00]  around the neck and chest and pressing his face against her lap area.  Persing's attorney tells...  Wow.  That's tough to pull off, man.  That really is.  You're sitting side by side.  That's not an easy maneuver, man.  Wow.  You know how hard it is just to sleep in those seats.  You're going to need a chiropractor when the plane lands.  You are completely bent over.  You're in violation.  A chiropractor and a breath saver.  You're going to need a chiropractor. 
[01:48:30]  That's a maneuver, man.  Try it at home.  Not easy.  Pressing his face against her lap area.  Persing's attorney tells us...  Her client was simply trying to sleep.  Quote,  Essentially, Mr. Persing has a chronic illness.  He was in month 10 of taking his medication that made him drowsy.  His head was down on her lap, napping.  What's his illness?  And this indictment also claims that the couple threatened violence against the flight attendant.  However, their attorney says not so.  She says that the only threat they made against the flight attendant was to report him to his supervisors for bad service. 
[01:49:00]  I don't like the couple, and I don't like the snitch supervisor or the snitch flight attendant.  Everyone in this story.  Bunch of do-gooders and two creeps who can't just go to the bathroom and get it done.  Yeah.  That's where you're supposed to do it.  Exactly.  Make her wait.  You're on a plane.  He's ill.  He's very ill.  He needs to smell trout every four hours.  And we're not landing soon. 
[01:49:30]  Is Tenacious D here?  Oh, they're here?  Okay.  We got Marge on the phone.  We got to talk to Marge for a couple of minutes.  Oh, good morning, gentlemen.  Hi, Marge.  Marge.  Hold on, Marge.  Now, I heard you on a lot of news programs this morning.  Right.  How did I sound?  Like a professional.  I heard you on 1010 Winds here in New York City.  And what you're doing is trying to make people aware that you have a couple of puppies that should be stomped to death, right?  Oh, please. 
[01:50:00]  I beg of you.  To stomp the puppies to death.  This is a really serious situation.  We're looking for a doctor that will operate on these two little puppies.  They have cleft palate.  So can a gynecologist work?  It kind of looks like that without the teeth.  Yeah.  Marge, you're going against nature.  Not all the baby turtles are supposed to make it to the ocean.  Not all dogs are supposed to survive.  But you know what?  When you see children like this, who obviously are going to be okay if they had the help of human beings, you don't turn your back on them. 
[01:50:30]  All right, Marge, what's the problem with the dogs?  Yeah.  Without the law of nature, these little puppies are, once they're okay, are going to grow up and they're going to be wonderful pets.  Noof.  Noof.  But what's, Marge, what's wrong?  Here's my question with you.  What is actually, the dogs are sick?  What's wrong with them?  They're not sick.  Actually, when we picked them up, they were about six ounces each.  And now they're 10 ounces and they're very, very healthy. 
[01:51:00]  But what's the problem?  They can't suck.  Yeah.  All right, so they can't suck.  All right, so we know their names aren't Rich and Voss.  They can't suck because they have a cleft palate.  Thank you very much, sir.  Marge, you don't need a veterinarian.  What do we need?  You need a nice kick to the face, that non-existent lip will swell and they'll have normal lips. 
[01:51:30]  Let me interrupt.  All right, Marge.  Because, you know, you know how I feel about animals.  Paging Dr. Martin.  Paging Dr. Martin.  I want you to promise me that the two of you are going to come out to Little Shelter in Huntington and see these little puppies.  I would have nightmares for weeks.  I can't look at these two little monsters.  You're holding two monsters.  They are adorable.  They're freak monsters.  This is important.  Horrible predator mouths. 
[01:52:00]  Don't you want to know how we feed them?  Okay.  We take, like, a tube and it goes right down into their little esophagus and that is how they are able to eat.  Oh, that's adorable.  That is how they get their nourishment.  And I guarantee you that in about six weeks, these puppies are going to be so healthy.  All right, Marge.  I want to know how is a vet going to help these things? 
[01:52:30]  They could actually sew this back together?  A vet is going to help them in the same way that they help people that have to help them.  They do this?  This is proven?  Or are you just like a little, are you a Marge Mengele trying to figure out how to fix these things?  A vet knows.  This is a very rare operation, but a nice, good vet that's going to do this free of charge so that Little Shelter doesn't have to spend the money.  Because this is a series of operations.  It's not just one.  Oh, series.  It's like multiple. 
[01:53:00]  Best out of five or seven?  Multiple, you know, like multiple orgasms.  Oh, Marge, don't try to be funny.  Well, I just want to make sure you understand.  Marge, there's a guy, Greg from Virginia on the line.  His wife is a vet.  So what do they do?  All they have to do is call Little Shelter and or go online, www.littleshelter.com in Huntington at AOL.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That was the worst Internet plug. 
[01:53:30]  Marge, I want to say it.  Shut up.  I'm trying to help you.  You're showing your age.  Marge.  I have www.littleshelter.com in Huntington.  Oh, Marge, no.  Just like some of your dogs, you've run out of time.  Her URL has a cut palate.  It's horrible.  At AOL.net.  All right.  We got to take a break.  All right.  Tenacious D is now.  Maybe Marge will call back.  Yeah, but we got to take a break so we get Tenacious D on the radio. 
[01:54:00]  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Hi.  I just got wowed.  It was great.  I'm not supposed to talk about it, though.  I got to go now.  Introducing the Opie and Anthony wow line.  If you get wowed, we want to hear about it.  Call 866-WOWME05.  That's 866-WOWME05.  And tell us all about it.  And if your message isn't too stupid, we might just play it on the air.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:54:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  We got Jack Black and Kyle Gass in studio.  Tenacious D on the couch.  It's true.  Gents.  We pressed the flesh and everything.  Oh, we did.  Yeah, we had enough time to press the flesh.  I, right off the bat, got to apologize to Mr. Black.  Yeah?  That's right.  I got to apologize to you.  Uh-oh.  What happened?  You did our show back in the day at WNEW. 
[01:55:00]  You came on.  Yes.  With Kyle and Hanks once.  Way back before you were anything.  I was there for you.  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  And, of course, you came in with Kyle.  And then what did you do?  I said many times in the show, as you got bigger and bigger and bigger, I'm like, we're never going to see Jack Black again.  I said it.  I said it.  I said, we get the guys on the way up and we get the guys on the way down.  We never get them when they're truly happening. 
[01:55:30]  What are you saying about Jack now?  No.  That's a hell of a backhanded compliment.  Oh, interesting.  He said maybe I'm on the way down.  That is.  Well, uh.  He's a troublemaker.  Jesus.  Whatever.  I told everybody, we'll never see him again because, you know, now he's got a million movies going on.  I don't think that's.  Look, I'm still here.  That's all right.  I forgive you.  Obviously, he's loyal.  That is true.  A lot of guys, you know, when you're in blockbuster motion pictures, they kind of leave the other guys to their side.  It only took me to get one lousy radio gig at a crappy station in Massachusetts to ditch my entire band. 
[01:56:00]  I ditched them in a second to make less money than I was making in construction for a chance that I might be able to do some radio in Worcester, Mass.  And I ditched my whole band for it.  And you, King Kong.  And he's still loyal.  Hey, he's in movies, too.  Kyle's in movies.  I worked for a day.  Is that what it is?  He was the gym teacher.  In that movie? 
[01:56:30]  The new guy?  In that movie.  Yeah, whatever that one was.  Yeah, man.  Come on.  But, Jack, Kong.  Kong.  You were amazing in that movie.  Thank you.  Amazing.  I appreciate it.  Did you know you wrote a song?  Huh?  The theme song?  I did write a song for King Kong.  But it didn't make it into the soundtrack.  But it's like a Japanese import.  You can get it.  Yes.  It's a very rare track.  Japanese import.  It is, though.  It's very, very epic.  It's in Japanese.  Yeah.  Well, don't make fun of Japan today.  They had a little earthquake.  And they got a 16-inch wave that's going to hit the coast any moment. 
[01:57:00]  They've actually been saying there's a tsunami that's 16 inches.  Yes, inches high.  And they've been promoting this on the news like it's the biggest thing.  Michelle, cancel that benefit.  Yeah.  Yeah, they're going to need some help over there.  Cancel that.  16 inches.  We're not kidding, Jack.  It's not a radio.  If it's coming at you, like, really fast.  Yeah, what if it's coming at, like, 10,000 miles an hour?  It'd be a deadly 16-inch.  Right at the ankles.  Your ankles are just.  You're going to be done.  You might have wet socks by the end of this thing. 
[01:57:30]  How long has it been since you guys actually did gigs together?  You've been doing them the whole time.  About eight years.  We haven't done a gig yet.  No.  About eight years.  We sprinkle them throughout.  Yeah.  We'll do a benefit here and there.  We're going on a world tour right now.  Are you doing the garden?  The whole world?  You guys are doing the garden?  Where are they speaking English?  We're doing the garden.  And, yeah, that's the pinnacle.  If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.  Go on.  That's what Frank said.  Go on. 
[01:58:00]  If you can make it at MSG, you can make it.  It's for you and me.  No, you would think, you know, you're an actor, of course.  Movies.  Why continue with the music?  Is it something that you just really don't know?  Oh, why don't you just give up?  Oh, boy.  Why don't you give up?  I don't know.  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying a lot of people just kind of dedicate themselves to one thing.  I don't know how successful your band was before you went to radio. 
[01:58:30]  Not very.  But I'm sensing you never felt the roar of the crowd.  Well, not like Madison Square Garden.  When they're ravenous and they're screaming, you can feel the vibration down to your core.  Your nuggets are just...  What can you feel?  That makes sense.  You feel alive in a way that you don't just do...  In front of a camera.  Exactly.  The sterile environment of the camera.  It's pretty exciting making movies.  I would think it would be.  But not at the time. 
[01:59:00]  At the time, it's actually kind of...  Silly?  No, just comparatively, it's kind of boring.  You've got to wait a year to see if it gets the response you want it to get, whereas a live performance...  Why don't you just do the performance at the garden and then just put a big green screen up,  and then later, in post, they could drop in the people.  Yeah.  And you don't even have to worry about selling tickets or anything.  He wants to feel the crowd is what he's telling you.  Yeah.  No, you get addicted to the adrenaline high.  I love that there's...  That Lucas sound or something, you could shake the place around. 
[01:59:30]  I'm just saying, everything could be done in post.  It's true.  Remember those fake actors we had?  It's nothing special, though.  All the actors want to rock, and all the...  That is true.  All the rockers want to act.  So you get to do it.  All the sinners, saints.  You get to do it, though.  It's a lot.  I'm just trying to...  Yeah.  Let's look back at Dr. Noah Drake from General Hospital.  Whoa.  Was he in a power band?  That was right.  That was a Rick...  Of course.  Springfield.  Ricky was a great... 
[02:00:00]  Actor rocker.  Yes.  Another great New Jersey...  Was he?  Double threat, right?  Double threat.  Wasn't he?  He could walk and sing.  That was a tasty jam, actually.  It was pretty catchy.  Back now when the skinny ties were in.  You know, you lit up the chain that they're hard to define, and that was kind of a aside  behind the music when you saw him  like 20 years later  doing like his acoustic version of the only  song you've ever heard him play.  You know, we never will have that problem since we started 
[02:00:30]  acoustic. They did that with the Jenny guy.  8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  They showed him playing it acoustically.  Tommy Two-Tone.  It's always kind of sad.  You know who else did it? It was the dude with the stroke.  What was that? Stroke.  Let's call the phone number and see what happens.  Yeah, hey, that's a  cool radio bit.  Wow. I never thought of that one.  Call 8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  Oh, wow. Was that just the thing?  You couldn't turn.  Radio said, hello, we're going to be calling 
[02:01:00]  Jenny.  I was like, 8-6-7-5-3-0-9.  All right, we get it.  Is Jenny there?  Didn't they get the plumber guy?  It's a laugh for everybody.  Radio stinks.  That was actually her number.  I saw a documentary and that was actually her number.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  Radio stinks.  It really does stink.  Yeah, we kind of hate it at this point.  Yeah.  I would love the rumble of the crowd like you're saying. 
[02:01:30]  You're looking at the grease pit.  It's never too late.  Yeah.  Get the bold band back together.  Look at cut.  I could do that.  You can start at any time.  So the Tenacious Day movie, come across like a rock guy or anything like that, but the kids  love you.  It doesn't seem like I'm a rock guy.  The kids love you.  What did you play in your band?  I was the lead vocalist in the band.  Was it punk rock?  Yeah, it was kind of, we were mostly compared to some type of chili peppers meets like... 
[02:02:00]  Bee Gees.  Bee Gees.  Man.  I was trying to place it.  I wouldn't pay to have the demo tape right now.  Oh, you can punch that up.  Believe me.  I got it.  I got that.  Can you punch it up?  They've ragged me about it.  After the break.  They've pounded me about it.  Wait, do we have a copy of that?  Playing around?  Good idea.  I did a love song to Marsha Brady.  Nice.  That was one of my little...  The luck of the luck of the world for us?  You really had a thing for Marsha when you were a kid.  Who didn't?  Yeah.  Growing up?  Here's the weird thing, though.  I had the wet dream about the middle... 
[02:02:30]  Jan.  Jan.  The middle...  Jan.  Eve Plum.  Eve Plum went through about three episodes where she was acceptable.  Before she was too young, and then she got really goofy.  Yeah.  But three episodes, and I believe it was with the president.  Yeah, but Olsen, too, but it was the first three.  Susan Olsen.  She was in a karate stage.  I agree that Marsha was the hottest one, but for some reason, Jan was the one that popped  up in my dream for my first wedding.  What about the movie?  Wow, really? 
[02:03:00]  What about the movie, Marsha?  And I think it's because in my subconscious, I thought I had a better chance of getting it.  Better shot.  It was more reality-based.  And you weren't the football guy.  You weren't getting Marsha.  And we were on the...  We were in the Brady Bunch living room on the couch.  Really?  And the rest of the Brady's were out.  I don't know where they were, and it was just me and Jan.  Wow.  It was pretty great.  Alice peeking around the corner.  Me and Robert Reed.  That was no dream.  And then we met.  Remember when we did Mad TV?  Marsha, Tony, that... 
[02:03:30]  Then me and Kyle, we did Mad TV.  Yeah?  That TV show.  And she was there.  Eve Plum was there.  And I was like, uh, this is awkward, but I want to tell you, you were my first wet dream.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Didn't she make the slutty movies?  Isn't that awkward?  That's surprising.  She was flattered.  But she made Dawn Portrait of a Teenage Runaway.  Yeah, she made the slutty movies after the Brady Bunch, the after-school special.  She tried to break out of that character, and it worked for about a week.  Wow.  And then that was it. 
[02:04:00]  But now you see her on little reunion shows and stuff.  But yeah, it was Marsha for me.  Of course.  Right age, you know.  What's up with the movie?  Tenacious D, the movie.  Did we make a movie?  I don't know.  Was it a concert?  Have you not seen it?  What is it?  I have not seen it.  You didn't get your copy?  I thought that, uh, I thought that, uh, industry moguls as yourselves would have got  an advanced copy.  Ah, somebody.  Somebody fumbled the ball.  Yeah.  I apologize.  If they didn't get a DVD screener.  Team D apologizes.  There should be the screener.  It's coming time for the Oscar DVD screeners. 
[02:04:30]  Uh, yes, for your consideration.  We're going for best, uh, lighting design.  Oh.  And, uh.  I'll watch for that.  And costumes.  Title sequence.  You are the best title sequence.  Costumes for a period piece.  We'll go up and accept those.  But I'm saying if it's hard out there for a pimp can win.  Then why can't the D?  Why can't the D, like, get one in there?  Yeah.  Why not?  Dude, I totally miss you, I think would be a good Oscar.  What is the movie?  Is it a concert film or is it, like, is it lead up to a concert?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It's not a concert film. 
[02:05:00]  This is, uh, this is, uh, the real story.  The biopic of Tenacious D.  Of how we became the greatest band on Earth.  And it's kind of like, uh, I like to say it's Road Warrior meets Lord of the Rings meets  Beavis and Butthead.  Wizard of Oz.  What was this?  With a casual nod to somebody else.  Where's the Stoney guys?  Where's the Stoney guys?  Oh.  Just fried green to me. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, Cheez for a minute.  Here's the thing.  We have the single most Stoney-est scene.  Yeah?  It has been said.  Stoney-est.  Stoney-est.  Which is a new category in the Oscars.  There's a Stoney scene in there.  The most Stoney-est scene.  Not since altered states.  Did you see that?  Whoa.  Dude.  When what's going to turn into ashes and blew away?  Yeah, yeah.  That's Stoney.  Yeah.  What's the movie with I'm going to suck your brain dry?  I'm going to suck your brains dry?  I'm going to suck your brain dry.  Scanners?  Okay, Scanners. 
[02:06:00]  Scanners was the head exploding.  Yeah.  That was just, that wasn't Stoney.  We stole from Scanners.  That was just.  No, that wasn't Stoney.  We haven't seen from Scanners in our film.  We do have a sequence.  A direct steal.  If you watched it stoned, it was petrifying.  Yeah.  The exploding head.  Yeah, but Grey Lady Down was petrifying to you.  Grey Lady Down made me stop smoking pot.  The weird thing was Black Hawk Down made me start.  Did it?  Yeah.  We have better special effects than Scanners, believe it or not.  Wow.  Thank you, Fly.  Thank you, Fly.  Grey Lady Down, that's the last time, well, and stopped smoking pot.  Charlton Heston, a submarine movie with David Carradine in the rescue sub. 
[02:06:30]  They go down and it was very perilous and the people were ready to be crushed the hole  and it was very claustrophobic and I was smoking a lot of pot.  I was really stoned and I felt like I was in that sub with them and I had to run into  my room and lay down on my bed and curl in the fetal position and cry on a queer show.  It was last week.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was really like the last time I really seriously smoked weed. 
[02:07:00]  That's when you got a downgrade to a not as powerful.  That sounds like it was the chronic.  It was, I don't know what it was, but it was really out of control.  Snoop gave you a nugget.  Yeah.  You should never smoke the Snoop nugget.  Back then it was more quantity than quality where you could get a good four finger lid for  like 25 bucks and you would smoke the whole thing.  Is that back when they used to call it Indica Bud?  Indica Bud.  They don't have Indica anymore.  I don't know.  What happened to that?  I get that.  It's like a strain.  Indica's gone because they just mixed it up with too many different strains. 
[02:07:30]  I don't think you can find a pure breed.  No pedigree anymore?  No.  You can't find a pure one.  I'll say one thing about you guys.  You have not lost your regular guy vibe to you as far as the way you dress.  I kind of like that.  No, we have.  This is just how we dress up for show business.  Only for show business.  Yeah, we're a pretty fine tailored wear.  We're Gucci now.  It's usually ascots.  Kyle has on NBA white socks with flip-flops crammed into them.  I went to the next game and the equipment guy was a fan and he gave me. 
[02:08:00]  And I was out of socks.  But you're wearing like flip-flops.  I was out of socks.  It was serendipitous.  You're wearing flip-flops with socks though and it looks like.  My feet gotta breathe, bro.  But where it goes between your toes looks like a slingshot being pulled back.  That looks painful.  And people have given him the socks that have the toe groove in there.  And he doesn't want them.  Asian lady socks is what they are.  Because they have to wear those at like sushi and nail places.  That is the outfit of every American who's ever been arrested in Thailand. 
[02:08:30]  But it's true.  You were freaking out.  You were going, God, I gotta get some socks.  What a drag.  I don't have any socks.  I know.  It's true.  And then that's what it is to be in show business.  Yeah.  Some dude just gives you some NBA socks.  People get any socks.  The guys who don't need it.  Get it.  Really.  What's the new CD about?  The Pick of Destiny.  It's a soundtrack recording the company of the motion picture by the same title.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's part of our triple threat burrito.  Triple threat, huh?  Yeah.  The three-pronged attack. 
[02:09:00]  Dancing with the Stars.  Movie.  CD.  Exactly.  See?  TV projects.  I want to go on Biggest Loser.  I love Biggest Loser.  Come on.  I want to go on.  Carolyn Ray gains weight every week as the host.  And everyone else is losing weight.  Dude, I think if you had the cameras, though, you'd have to lose it.  I'd have to be like.  Yeah.  You think so?  Be a buff guy you'd have to?  It's hilarious.  Why do you want to lose it?  These fatties are like working their asses off every...  I really feel like I could keel at any moment.  Is that it?  Dude, he was so young.  Health reasons. 
[02:09:30]  He was one of those guys.  You're a more celebrity fit club.  Because when I'm on a scale, and I'm like, okay, let me just see how it feels, and I  push on the counter in front of me, and then I get down to like 160.  Oh, right, right.  You take the weight off of you.  This is how it would feel.  Walking around, I would be like an elf.  Oh, you actually feel how your feet would feel carrying that amount of weight.  Yeah.  If you were the weight you wanted to be.  I could run nonstop.  You've gone up and down through the years.  We've watched.  Yes.  We've seen some movies. 
[02:10:00]  These are creepy.  Well, Mars Attacks, you were a bigger guy in Mars Attacks.  I don't know, dude.  I'm on the middle of an upswing right now.  Are you?  Well, you're, you know.  The chins are back.  This summer, Jack likes chins.  Now there's a new word in fear.  That must have been great getting the call, though, to Dukong.  Because that's one of those, what they call, blockbusters.  Yeah. 
[02:10:30]  Was it really, though?  Oh, stop it now.  No, wait a minute.  No, wait a minute.  No, wait a minute.  All right.  All right.  Let's see.  It's not like the Titanic.  It was not.  No, it wasn't.  It was like the Star Wars.  I mean, it's big.  It's big, but I think they were hoping for...  Oh, I don't know.  Nothing could have been better for Kyle.  Only the closest of friends could ever give a guy crap like that.  Whenever I don't succeed to the maximum potential, Kyle's there. 
[02:11:00]  I said it wasn't a success.  The good friend that he is.  How much did Elf make?  How happy were you?  How happy were you?  Can we get some Mojo?  Can we just go Elf versus Tom?  Oh, what a fast dude.  Oh, I mean, if you want to slow it down.  Wow.  I should clear it.  Kyle was in Elf.  Of course.  Oh, was I?  Just in case nobody knew.  Just probably.  But, yeah, no. 
[02:11:30]  It wasn't as big a hit as they had anticipated perhaps.  We're coming off a Lord of the Rings.  Yeah.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  There's a lot of hype and everything.  There was a lot of anticipation.  So I think if he was just Peter Jackson from the old horror movies he used to make,  and then he made King Kong, it would have been like the hugest movie ever.  It would have been hit.  That was like China's GNP.  I loved the hell out of King Kong.  I did too, but it was great.  People got nervous.  It was three hours long.  These dummies that want their hour and 45 minutes.  Oh, screw them. 
[02:12:00]  I, uh, well, to answer your question, when I got the call, yeah, I was pretty stoked.  And Kyle was pretty jealous.  Yeah.  You know what?  You know, though?  Pretty effing jealous.  Let me just ask you this, though.  So much for tenacious D.  Let me ask you honestly, though.  Oh, this is, yeah.  Was it beauty that killed the baby?  What an ass you are to your pal.  I'm just asking.  We punch him.  It was beauty, killed the beast.  All right. 
[02:12:30]  But, um, yeah.  God damn.  So I recommend, though, New Zealand.  Yeah.  That is a sweet place to vacation.  Is it?  Yeah.  I lived there for six months.  It took forever to make that movie.  Yeah.  That's one thing about Peter Jackson.  Yeah.  Great New Zealand film.  How great is that?  Great movie.  About true marriage.  But if you go, go down south to the South Island.  I just picture it all looking the same.  It's kind of like a combination.  You know what it's like?  It's like Hawaii meets the Colorado Rockies.  It's colder, though.  It's cold.  It's crazy.  Meets Beavis and Butthead.  It's like I'm talking about my own movie. 
[02:13:00]  Bill and Ted.  I think you're trying to think of Bill and Ted.  All right.  Listen, they're going to cut us off.  Damn them.  We'll get the big plug through.  The CD is called Tenacious D, The Pick of Destiny.  It's available.  It's the soundtrack from the film.  When is the film coming out?  November 22nd.  November 22nd.  And you guys, when are you guys doing Madison Square Garden?  December 1st.  December 1st.  Check it out.  Hey, where do they get the Tenacious D tour dates?  TenaciousD.com.  There you go.  And Tenacious is T-E-N-A-C-I-O-U-S-D. 
[02:13:30]  We use all the vowels.  If you're not using every vowel.  We kicked off the tour on the 17th at the Gibson Amphitheater in Los Angeles.  You should come.  Playing the Enormo Dome.  It's going to be the best concert since Pink Floyd the Wall.  What?  That's how much money was spent on the show.  Slang pigs?  We recreate the landscape of hell.  Very cool.  Got to see it.  Thank you, gentlemen.  Thank you, guys.  Thanks so much.  Tenacious D, everyone.  Thanks for coming.  If you're not going to join us over at XM, have a great day.  It's the 2006 Homeless Shopping Spree, only on the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:14:00]  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The Opie and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerates shopping for Christmas  presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  Golden Buns is going to get busy. 
[02:14:30]  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless  shopping spree on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Buns!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  Mic check, mic check, check one, two.  Let's walk.  Wait a minute, Anthony.  I can't hear you.  Yes, you can.  Stop.  Don't tease. 
[02:15:00]  Look at this awful mustache.  Oh, my goodness.  We don't like your mustache, sir.  Excuse me, sir.  There you go.  Who did this?  You know who he looked like?  He looked like Morris Day in 1988.  He was an Indian guy, and he had a Morris Day mustache.  Morris Day.  The guy should be doing the bird in front of an oncoming vehicle.  All right, I got one.  Ready?  All right.  You got to wear a paper hat to go to work.  I can't look at her.  Oh, no. 
[02:15:30]  I can't look at her.  I don't look at her.  I'm sorry, miss.  Drop something.  You had a good show?  Wow.  Wow.  Hi, sir.  That was awful.  Oh, is that awful?  It's awful because she has to.  And she was right there.  It wasn't like he did it with her across the street or behind a glass.  I don't hide with my comments for the most part.  Oh, that was horrible.  How close was I?  That wasn't a comment.  That was an assault.  Look at this Frenchman. 
[02:16:00]  Ha ha.  You got to wear a paper hat to go to work.  Oof.  And it was just the blatant truth.  Yeah, that was fucking.  Thrown right into her face.  Luke and Laura.  Luke, they got mad.  Fucking who gives a shit?  Laura's a fat pig now.  I saw like the coming attractions for that.  Genie plants.  On the insider.  And Luke has hair like Colin Quinn if it was gray.  The fuck both of them.  Luke and Laura can die.  Well, let me tell you what's going on with Luke and Laura.  Luke.  Oh, good.  Luke looks like he should be on a Dateline special. 
[02:16:30]  No, I'm not even kidding.  Walking into a house for a while.  He looks awful.  And Laura gained a few LBs over the years.  She's a fat fuck.  I hate the way people love their wedding.  Remember Luke and Laura got married?  No, I don't.  Hey, fatty.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I don't remember.  And then see who turns around.  Wow.  She's a tall African woman.  Wow.  Awful ass.  Jesus.  A marathon runner?  What did your name used to be before you became a woman?  Hey, fatty. 
[02:17:00]  So, anyway, Tenacious D.  You were great on the show today.  Blah, blah, blah.  Did she turn around?  No.  She knows you're talking to her.  Oh, grow your hair in.  Let's go.  It's so manageable this way.  Let's go this way.  She has a mousy little broad.  Yeah, yell it now, smart guy.  What happened?  That woman in the fur coat.  Is that a fur coat or is that just her pelt?  Wait, what do you want me to do?  She's not that fat. 
[02:17:30]  I'll do it.  She isn't?  No, she's not that fat.  She had a big coat on.  What can I say?  Oh.  Oh, sassy.  This is smart.  Just make snide comments where everyone can hear.  Yeah.  This is usually stuff mumbled under people's breaths.  The people aren't actually supposed to hear it.  We have security.  What a mess.  Man, boob alert.  Hello, Mr. Colbert. 
[02:18:00]  Hello.  This corn is turning into a crack house.  This corn stinks.  It really does.  Where's Mac?  I hope his legs are gone.  Nah, he's dead.  No, he's gone.  I don't know where he is.  I think he died.  I hope he's walking on two awful stumps.  Gotta be.  Hey, what happened to Andrew?  We still can't find him?  No.  Put out an alert.  Gotta look for that guy.  We need him for the homeless shopping spree.  What the hell is this guy's story? 
[02:18:30]  I don't know.  Let's ask him.  The airline goes to his eyebrows.  How are you, sir?  What are you doing today?  How's everything?  Just working.  What do you work?  Driving cab.  Are you driving cab?  You're very well dressed in driving cab.  Usually you don't see cabbies wearing suits.  Driving cab.  Oh, he drives like a car.  Do you have a celebrity in the car?  I get away.  Who are you driving today?  To Newark.  To Newark?  Oh, you're just taking someone to the airport?  Yes.  Where are they going to? 
[02:19:00]  Are they on the no-fly list?  Maybe.  Are they bisexual or transgender?  I'm not sure yet.  Okay.  What airline do they fly?  Continental?  American?  Delta?  Anyone.  You don't want to say.  All right.  Very suspicious.  I'm getting to the bottom of this.  Yeah.  There's a guy here.  Thank you, sir.  You've been very helpful.  And I don't like the way you hung that woman while she was still alive with a sheet.  Little fat-faced criminal.  That's a little midget.  He really was. 
[02:19:30]  Ugh.  You nasty guy.  It's awful.  Look at this shoe-conducing fucking color she's wearing.  Ugh.  I know I sound like an old queen commenting on women's sweaters, but that was atrocious.  What else are you going to comment on out here today?  It's true.  It's an awful day.  All right.  Let's just walk in.  There we go inside.  No support today, by the way.  No.  Wow.  Except for two of the regulars.  Hey, mama.  I'm a nasty.  Two regulars today.  That's it for the walkover.  Thanks for nothing.  Thanks for nothing.  Opie and Anthony.  XM 202.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country. 
[02:20:00]  Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes. 
[02:20:30]  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of town hall PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[02:21:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:21:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:22:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:22:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:23:00]  And I'm such an obsessive idiot.  Jack Black is wearing black in it, and Kyle's wearing silver, so I had two different markers. 
[02:23:30]  And I'm such an OCD freak that I had them sign it beforehand just in case Ope self-destructed the interview,  because it could have gotten ugly, which he was fair.  He warned me, like, this might get ugly.  So I'm like, all right, get them to do it quickly.  I whispered to Jimmy, you might want to get that picture signed beforehand.  But no, it's actually okay now, the way the light hits it.  I don't know.  I was just getting a weird feeling before the interview, but they were great.  Yeah.  They were absolutely great.  They're playing the guard on December 1st.  They're very nice guys.  They got a movie coming out.  They got a soundtrack coming out. 
[02:24:00]  They're just rocking and rolling.  Were you uncomfortable with the paper hat thing?  It was cringy, but it was actually really funny.  I mean, so it was uncomfortable, but it was worth it.  It was like, I didn't mind being...  She turned right around.  What did she not?  What did she do after that?  I don't know.  Re-evaluated her life as she was humiliated on the radio while we skipped away.  What could she do?  She kind of turned away.  Did she?  Yeah.  We get that on video.  Where's Sam?  Sam?  It was embarrassing.  You didn't get it? 
[02:24:30]  I am a camera.  You didn't have your camera?  What was wrong, Sam?  You didn't have your camera?  Sam, what was wrong?  I was in the process of turning the camera on.  Ew.  I hate to say that's your catch word now.  He throws it in whenever he can.  But he's trying not to say it that way.  No, he's trying to say it.  Now, instead of just saying, I just didn't have anything rolling, now he's going to throw  it in all the time.  Yeah.  I like this kid.  He's got rosacea.  Hey.  Every day.  Apple cheek, young fella.  Every day, unless it's the same guy, which it could be. 
[02:25:00]  It could be, Ope.  Art from Boston, he writes, God fucking damn, the gay intern promo pieces.  It's amazing.  Funniest thing I've heard on any of the promos.  I haven't heard that yet.  We're looking for new interns, I guess?  Well, let's say, who did the promo?  And Steve took a gay angle?  Wow.  Big surprise there.  Wow.  No.  Either that or wife beating.  What?  This is the second semester we've used it.  Oh, really?  Oh.  Do we have it?  Can we hear it real fast?  Bill, go ahead.  Being an intern for the Ope and Anthony radio show can be a worthwhile experience if you 
[02:25:30]  follow these simple guidelines.  First, you must adhere to the company dress code.  You could wear either garters or bong panties.  When working in close quarters with others for extended periods of time, personal hygiene  is also very important.  You will shave every third day, which includes legs and pubic area, navel to anus.  Conduct in studio and on air is also of critical importance.  You will be naked within 20 minutes and then sleep naked unless otherwise instructed.  On occasion, interns will need to cater to very specific needs of the radio show hosts. 
[02:26:00]  You will perform any and all sexual acts, including anal penetration and or ingestion of cum when told to.  Interns looking for additional credit are encouraged to go the extra mile.  Sex acts can include, but are not limited to, stripping, handjobs, fingering, masturbation, dildoing, vibrators, and object insertion.  All application of lubes to myself, you, or any object will be done by you. 
[02:26:30]  Of course, it's important to maintain a positive attitude despite any objection you may have to these requests.  You will not cry, sob, whine, or otherwise show displeasure or unhappiness.  Non-compliance with a host's request will be dealt with effectively and immediately.  If you are non-compliant, you will be tied to the bed, and I will do whatever I wish to you.  So if you think you have what it takes to be an Opie and Anthony show intern, look for details on opieandanthony.com.  I can cuddle, spoon, hold, or touch you in any way.  What is fucking wrong with this? 
[02:27:00]  I'll tell you what the problem with that promo is.  Not long enough.  Yeah, we need a few more minutes on that one.  Yeah, you're just getting worked up, and then the promo ends.  It sucks.  Yeah.  Why not play that and just play a hunk of the show in real time?  Yeah, we got a guy coming in Friday to try to drink a gallon of milk in an hour.  It's an old fraternity thing.  It's also been done on the radio.  We're not going to try to make believe that we came up with that one.  But the guy's trying out to be part of the eggnog drinking contest. 
[02:27:30]  Yes, that has begun the tryouts for the eggnog drinking contest.  So we're looking forward to that on Friday.  Ah.  And then I was reading the message boards last night, and I guess it's some dopey radio show in Tulsa, is it?  Wow.  As you said that, I was thinking of that.  Really?  Jesus.  They think we ripped off Fatty Pig Fatty from them.  They have to be newbies in the business, I guess.  What's their website?  Let's go to their website.  Fat Chicks on the Radio being weighed is one of the oldest radio bits ever. 
[02:28:00]  And I came up with the name Fatty Pig Fatty, and I came up with the contest idea.  Yeah.  And I'm not bragging.  I'm simply saying I've never been to Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Ever.  Ever.  I'll tell you what the bit is when it's done by, you know, like morning zoo types and stuff.  It's called Fat Tuesday.  What is that?  It's one of these bits you can get off like a service.  Like this service is out there where you subscribe and they give you a list of bits.  And one of them that's been done by just about every fucking radio station or every morning show in America is a bit called Fat Tuesday, and they weigh girls on Tuesday. 
[02:28:30]  Fat Tuesday.  Get it?  Fat Tuesday.  But we try to throw our spin onto some of these old school bits.  So Jimmy came up with Fatty Pig Fatty, the pig mask, and the like to make it a little different.  And I never heard of Fat Tuesday.  I just thought it would be fun to weigh fat chicks.  Again, I'm not saying it's a genius stretch, but to accuse somebody of thievery.  But these dopes think that we actually, I don't even know their names.  I only know about this because I was on the message board. 
[02:29:00]  It's on Whackbag.  Yeah.  Other message boards wouldn't have done it.  Other message boards would have just sided with them and accused us of stealing.  Yeah.  Hey, Stan, let's go to Whackbag and get the link, and then let's just see what their site is so we can talk highly of them.  Oh, thank you, Kenny.  Have a water.  Yes.  Oh, thank you.  Four dollars for...  Ew, I hate that!  No, I can't eat that!  What, is it a pussy?  Ew, what is it?  I hate black olives.  Thank you, Stan.  Oh, no.  I totally hate olives. 
[02:29:30]  I love olives, green, of the green variety, but black olives stink.  Like green olives?  Love green olives.  Hey, Ken, how about this is what I want.  I hate black olives.  I want a little bottle of green olives to eat.  For real?  I would never lie about that.  Don't ever question my olive orders again.  It's humiliating.  Although the olive has given a little flavor to me.  And I want the olive with the pits in them, believe it or not.  I like to chew on the pit a little.  I like to eat the olive and chew on the pit a little.  Oh, the pit a little. 
[02:30:00]  I like to chew the olive pit.  No, the bit is pit a little.  Pit a little.  I like to chew the pit a little.  I like to chew the pit a little.  Anthony, what oddity would you like?  I need nothing from you today, thank you.  Clean underwear, because he might have a doctor's appointment.  I have clean underwear on every day.  Could you bring Anthony some fucking, some nice silken panties, see-through mesh in the  front, so his balls are presentable for the doctor's face to be buried in?  I don't have a doctor's appointment today, and if I did, I would be clean for it.  Would you wear your clear-back thongs or your boy shorts? 
[02:30:30]  He likes his doctor's boy shorts.  Chaps.  Chaps.  I would just imagine walking into your body.  Oh, I can imagine.  The assless chaps.  One foot propped up in your leather boots on the fucking wall, so your asshole is wide  open.  I couldn't say that on CBS.  Yes.  I would give anything to see Anthony in the boy shorts bathing suit that the new James  Bond is wearing.  Maybe we could Photoshop that.  And when the doctor gives you the prostate check, say, hey, doc, how about a double knuckle 
[02:31:00]  fuck?  Double knuckle fuck with my chaps on.  I love chaps.  Tire, tire, tire.  I want to be spanked by a man while I'm wearing chaps and not consider it a gay act.  Well, good luck on that one.  Oh, come on.  Don't be fresh.  Godspeed on that.  Hey, we have some stories here that I would like to discuss.  Yeah?  Yes.  All right.  Yes.  There's the 50 worst artists in musical history, which I think... 
[02:31:30]  Why is Stan looking at gay porn?  Well, that's...  Oh, that's...  Why would you ask him an unanswered and no-need-to-be-answered question?  Stan?  Stan's a fruit.  Belltale sign, by the way.  That's right.  That's right.  This is one of the videos that's highlighted on their website of that show that...  All right.  All right.  Good way to have a real answer.  And what's...  What are they doing?  I mean, because I'm gay.  Atta boy, Stan.  There you go.  What is it?  It's one of their hosts, or lackeys, giving a 400-pound man a laugh dance.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Do that gay radio? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Trust me, bros.  We have no clue who you are.  No clue.  You just embarrass yourself by trying to say that a radio show is ripping off Fat Tuesday.  Fat Tuesday.  God, in the list of bits that have been done by just about everyone, Fat Tuesday is right  up there.  Yeah, it's one of those benchmarks of everybody.  Enough.  Ah, pal talk people.  Sorry.  What happened?  I guess I got to upgrade.  I got to do the same thing.  What?  I try to log on, and it says you got to upgrade. 
[02:32:30]  And XM's computers, as you know, don't allow you to do anything if you're not an administrator.  Right.  Right.  So why don't we get Mars in here right now and do that?  No, I can't.  Why don't we?  Right.  Why don't we?  Where's Mars?  Cameras are a-wasting.  All right, can I request that we go to a break?  My blood sugar level dropped drastically today.  Where'd it go?  Mars is here.  Hasn't happened in a while, because I didn't eat a lot of food this morning, so I want to  dig into this egg white omelet with the fresh vegetables, and I don't want to be eating 
[02:33:00]  on there.  Fresh vegetables of it all.  And I need to get some of this food in me, or I won't pass out.  All right, let's see.  Hold on.  If we can get this working.  Or I'll just sit here and listen to you.  Study on CNN.  Those with real smiles in photos are likely to be happy later.  What?  Really?  Yeah, well, that means if you're more likely to smile, then you have a fucker, you're more  likely to be happy someday, because you're happy then.  What the fuck kind of a stretch is that?  Show me a photo of John Wayne Gacy smiling, and I'll fucking smash that theory. 
[02:33:30]  But then again, he was happy as he raped a boy, so I could be incorrect.  This happiness is a little different than your happiness.  What does your shirt say?  What does Nosferatu have a...  By the way, excuse me.  When he walks in the room, why is there no theme music?  Yeah.  What...  Because I'm supposed to...  Oh, all right.  I'm trying to download software in the middle of a show.  What kind of...  What does that shirt say?  Brooklyn's finest. 
[02:34:00]  Yes.  It's a...  It's a shirt.  It's fucking...  It says Brooklyn's finest in script, but it's got like the little sparkles.  Sparkles like...  It's 1980.  It's like a fat girl's sweatshirt at Seaside Heights.  Right.  You should be wearing that with another fat girl, where it says best friend with a number  four life.  It...  It sickens me.  It's so inconvenient to have him as an intern.  He has to be invited in everywhere.  Like, every time he comes in the studio, he's got to be invited in.  He can't just come in. 
[02:34:30]  He brought a bit.  Oh!  He's a good boy.  What's the bit?  Are you sure he didn't just bit somebody or bite somebody?  Yeah.  Something like that?  Yeah.  Please.  Give yourself a bat crash.  I know.  Ooh.  Well, they're showing MTV...  Why are the headphones floating?  Oh, I was looking in the mirror.  All right, sorry.  Go ahead.  This bit on MTV where the parents sit down with the boyfriend or girlfriend and actually  watch their significant other go on...  Their child go on a date.  And then they sit there and basically communicate. 
[02:35:00]  And some of the things that are said are ridiculous.  Like, I can imagine...  Never imagine saying that's a parrot growing up.  What they say to each other.  So, thought maybe it'd be something interesting.  Ooh.  It sounds very scary.  Hold on.  Actually, it didn't, but...  Um, Pat?  Yeah.  Hey, I want to give Jimmy some props for a line that he made that nobody even acknowledged.  Thank you, Pat. 
[02:35:30]  When, uh, Opie started screaming, I can't eat this, and Jimmy said, what, a pussy?  Yeah, that did deserve more, but nobody heard it.  He said, what is it, a pussy?  It was all I had.  It was a great line, but, you know, you were busy.  That was very hurtful.  Have a little tomato-er.  You are the man, Jimmy.  Thank you, fella.  You're welcome.  Have a good day, fellas.  Bye.  Goodbye.  Bye.  Um...  So, I don't get his bit.  Well, the TV show, basically, the parents do not like the boyfriend or girlfriend of  their child. 
[02:36:00]  And, basically, they choose another boyfriend, another date for their child, and then they  go and watch it with the boyfriend or girlfriend, while they're all sitting on the couch, while  their child is on a date.  Isn't that when, and the guy who, like, the boyfriend they rejected has to jerk the father  off while they're watching the daughter on the date with the new guy?  And what sound does he make?  Well, when the guy's about to, when the father's about to come, because as the boyfriend jerks  him off, the father's looking straight ahead watching his daughter, and he's about to come, 
[02:36:30]  he puts his face in the neck of the ex-boyfriend, and he goes...  Oh, is that horrendous?  It's like...  Like, against the neck.  You feel the father's lift against your neck.  Oh, is that bad?  All right. 
[02:37:00]  We'll think about doing it after the break.  Yeah, why don't we do that?  I can't eat too much.  Why don't we think about doing it after the break?  The Opie and Anthony Show presents a Wild Bill production.  Hi, I'm Steve C., the beating heart of The Opie and Anthony Show.  Obviously, my voice is good for more than convincing children that I'm good friends with their parents.  I also volunteer my services as a part-time hostage negotiator.  Steve, it's an emergency, and you're the only one who can bring these hostages back alive. 
[02:37:30]  Why me?  What's the catch?  You might be responsible for the kidnapping.  You mean, it can't be.  You'll never catch me alive, coppers.  I am the unstoppable crime burglar.  I will blow away everyone in this room.  Dr. Crime Burglar, this is Steve C.  Let those children go.  Please, don't rape them.  He never said anything about rape.  I don't trust you, Steve C.  You never sent me my wow sticker. 
[02:38:00]  Well, you must not have sent a self-addressed stamped envelope to 111 West 57th Street, New York, New York, 10019.  It was your own fault.  Now let the kids out alive.  I did all that.  Well, were you one of those assholes that just sent an empty envelope with no self-addressed stamped envelope inside?  Sir, we have a clean shot.  Should we take it?  Yeah, shoot that bastard in the face.  You're safe now, kids. 
[02:38:30]  Let's go home.  Everyone, get in the van.  But Mr. Steve, where's our parents?  They're all dead.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:39:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. range.  Starring O.P. and Anthony and featuring Jimmy Norton and Phan and Travis and Steve and Mars and Poe.  Wow.  Everybody.  Yeah, it covers it all.  And Steve, you should have seen what he called Travis before.  He's like, uh, Travis.  Travis?  Travis.  Ooh.  What?  Nothing. 
[02:39:30]  We weren't calling you.  We were just talking about how Steve called you before.  Travis.  Travis has the, he has the beard of a fucking, an abortion clinic bomber who's been on the run for six months.  It's the fullest beard ever.  It's just awful and unkempt and hairs are all every witch away.  Travis is a fag of shit.  Nosferatu basically watched TV and brought it in as a bit for us today.  Are you here Sam's little titter? 
[02:40:00]  Who are they laughing at, by the way?  They enjoyed a big laugh out there.  Sam Pryce has something cute.  Nosferatu, it's called parental control.  Basically, the parents don't like, uh, the person their daughter or son is dating.  So MTV gets them another date or another boyfriend or girlfriend.  They go out on a date.  And the parents watch it in front of their kid's, uh, boyfriend or girlfriend. 
[02:40:30]  And it's, uh.  Boyfriend.  What?  With the boyfriend or girlfriend of their child.  And a lot of it.  I just said that.  Yeah, why are you yelling at Opie?  Thank God your internship's almost over.  A lot of it is so scripted.  A lot, I've seen this show.  Scripted up the ass.  Edited like fucking crazy.  He's no Sam.  And it's not done in any kind of real time thing that they're trying to show, like time frame.  See how lucky you are, Sam? 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Sorry, Anthony.  No, it's just, it's another one of these shows that try to come off like a real reality type show.  It's fake reality.  Yeah, fake reality.  All right, let's take a listen now.  Parental control.  Hi, I'm Casey.  I'm 19.  My boyfriend's name is Chris.  He's really hot.  He has a gorgeous smile and he always makes me laugh.  I've never seen anyone as controlling as Chris.  I'm sorry.  Drive!  My daughter can't even hang out with her girlfriends because Chris is so jealous.  Bad influence, bitch. 
[02:41:30]  Chris has quite a temper.  We've had more drama with Chris in eight months than our 30 years of marriage.  If I catch you wearing any of them, you're done.  I want a guy who will treat Casey like a prize, not a possession.  And I want someone that can return a smile to my daughter's face.  When you go on these dates, I want you looking at the ground.  Are you kidding me?  Does it look like I'm kidding you?  Does it look like I'm kidding you?  How phony is that?  It's so scripted and just fake. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, you could tell when the mother was talking, she was reading something.  I want you looking at the ground.  Shut up.  No one talks that way.  No.  How about some realistic talk?  You know, my daughter doesn't smile anymore because every time he comes over, he grabs  her by the throat and gives her mouth a good fuck.  He fucks my daughter's mouth like he's crying to the camera.  I don't want him to fuck my baby's mouth.  And the mother, whenever Chris comes over and my daughter's on the toilet shitting, he 
[02:42:30]  sneaks up behind me and presses his cock against my backside and says, how about a little ride  up the shitter?  He fucks my daughter's mouth and humps my wife's backside.  I'm powerless over Chris.  And he's got to watch it.  And he has to watch it.  He has to watch.  A little suggestion for the boys in the booth.  How about we change the pad data? 
[02:43:00]  It still says intern promo.  We did that a half hour ago.  We certainly did.  Oh, my God.  Who is the...  Oh, Jesus.  Hello, Bill.  Hello, Bill.  This is my beautiful daughter, Casey.  Hi, Casey.  I love playing guitar.  I love sports.  I love activities.  All my friends would say I'm the funniest out of our group.  And this is loser boyfriend, Chris.  Hey, how's it going?  How's it going, douchebag?  Pretty good, tough guy.  That's right.  Yeah.  I remember that, too. 
[02:43:30]  What's he trying to do?  Bite off my style?  Stupid bastard.  F*** this guy, Jason.  He's like an ugly version of me.  I've taken better-looking dumps.  So, I'm thinking we should go on a date.  Have a good time now.  Okay.  All right?  Keep your hands to yourself.  We'll get a broken neck.  Somebody have a leash for this guy?  No, it's tough.  The barbs are flying.  Hey, tough guy.  I've taken better-looking dumps.  And then the father chimes in.  And he took it in my daughter's mouth.  They make scat films. 
[02:44:00]  All right.  I think the bit might be working.  Hang in there, Jimmy.  We need you.  Well, the mother was complaining.  Whenever my daughter's in the shower,  he sneaks up behind me  and grabs my mastectomy scar.  He tweaks the scar tissue from behind.  Between his thumb and index finger.  He pinches it and he goes, 
[02:44:30]  he-le-le-le-le.  Rolls it around.  He-le-le-le-le.  He chews on my pit a little.  I can't get that out of my head.  My pit a little.  He fucks my daughter's mouth  and he pinches my wife's lack of breast scar.  And he spits olive pits into my daughter's asshole.  He's not a good boyfriend.  Him and his friend spit olive pits into her asshole 
[02:45:00]  after she's been drinking.  Oh, let's say hi to Jay.  What the hell?  Jay, what's up?  How are you today?  How you doing?  All right, Jay.  You guys are fucking awesome.  I've been listening to you on the regular radio station,  but I always can't call in  because it's normally like 5 o'clock at night.  Oh, you're listening to us on The Zone in Rochester.  Ah, right.  It's bullshit because I call the number  and they're like,  oh yeah, you got the right number,  but you have to call in the morning.  I'm like, yeah,  and then I want to know what they're talking about. 
[02:45:30]  Oh, exactly.  Right.  Exactly.  Right.  So I went out and got the XM just for you guys.  So I listen to you guys all day,  listen to the replays,  and I'm finally working it.  I drive tow truck.  I'm actually in it right now, but...  Yeah, where do you drive the tow truck?  Where do I drive?  He's not used to the XM show.  No.  Hey, what kind of olives you got?  You have a large jar of green olives, Jimmy. 
[02:46:00]  They're called queen olives.  Oh, well, now it makes sense.  I didn't use this fork yet.  I'm not sure, man.  Oh, have a couple of olives while you're at it.  Grab two.  Way to snatch a man's olives.  I can chew the pit a little.  You know what I mean?  I'm chewing on the pit a little myself.  Don't chew the pit.  Oh, what a little?  Oh, olive pits are disgusting.  He fucked my daughter's mouth 
[02:46:30]  and him and his friends opened her asshole  with olive pits and went...  I used to hate when I was a dishwasher  at the Chicago Pizza Pub.  Remember that place?  Yes.  In Huntington, Chicago Pizza Pub  in Huntington, New York.  In high school.  For deep dish pizza.  I used to be a dishwasher there.  Was that on Jericho Turnpike?  Yeah.  Jericho Turnpike.  Used to be a dishwasher there. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah.  So if you thought it was me, it's me.  I've done well for myself, fucko.  But I was a dishwasher.  And the worst thing that used to come through,  because I used to have to...  You used to have to work pretty quickly  as a dishwasher,  especially during the busy nights,  Friday and Saturday nights,  were pits from olives.  Yeah.  Olive pits spit out on a plate.  I am disgusted by the olive pit.  And I'd have to...  You know, you work inside.  I'd have to take my bare hands  and pick up people's plates 
[02:47:30]  they've been eating off of  and just grab whatever's in it  and right into the garbage.  Load the rack up.  Same thing.  The next one.  Just people's fucking...  Maybe that's why I'm all fucked up now.  I smell bit, by the way.  And I know I say that a lot.  First of all, Smokezilla from Whack Bag.  Olive who?  Knock, knock.  Olive.  Olive who?  Yes.  Remember that bit?  Olive spitting pits into your daughter's ass. 
[02:48:00]  Knock, knock.  I was a dishwasher too once, Anthony.  Really?  Did you guys quit together?  Like when Omar offered you money  to pick up some cocaine  and you threw your aprons at the owner  and walked away?  Threw the apron, walked away.  Never looked back.  Has anyone else noticed  I have a dislike for waterheads?  Yeah.  I don't know why.  They're just...  They're special.  And I want to go serious on this one.  Okay.  I don't want fake stories.  I once had a boss 
[02:48:30]  that was a waterhead.  Now look,  I need a better definition of waterhead  because that's a very gray area  as far as mental retardation goes.  He was...  He was retarded.  In what way?  Down syndrome retarded?  No, you couldn't...  Normal looking of abnormal lower intelligence.  Of the big tongue variety.  Let me ask you.  If a dog shit on the rug,  would he clean it up, 
[02:49:00]  eat it,  or worship it?  You know what?  I think he would clean it up.  Oh.  It's one of those good trained ones.  Yeah, yeah.  But Moe Howard,  three-studies haircut?  Don't remember, man.  This goes back to when I was  like a freshman in college  around there.  Came home for the summer.  Little Chinese-eyed.  And, um...  Huh?  Little Chinese-eyed?  Uh, no.  No?  He looked relatively normal,  you know.  Okay. 
[02:49:30]  His clothes didn't fit quite right.  How long would it take?  He was a bit overweight  and he had kind of a goofy haircut.  You walk up to him.  Mm-hmm.  You say,  Hi, how you doing?  How long would it take  for you to go,  All right,  something's a little off here.  Right away.  Right away, you'd notice.  As soon as he talks.  And this was your boss.  I actually had  a retarded person  as a boss.  I've told him  it's easy to get away  with shit, though, right?  No, I ended up  throwing all the plates  and stuff in the garbage  and I walked out.  He's probably a real 
[02:50:00]  stickler for the rules.  Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  Maybe that's it.  They go one way or the other.  You could just  get over everything on them  or...  Do you remember...  They look at everything  You're two minutes late!  You're two minutes late!  The clock,  it's at 8 o'clock.  It's both coming  at 8 o'clock.  At 8.02...  Dude.  My car was...  But my car was stuck.  The bus said to me  with the bus  and he told me to tell  so I tell.  And there's no reasoning  with him  so you have to hit him  over the head  with a bat? 
[02:50:30]  You're bringing up nightmares.  Really?  Is that what it was like?  We're back, yes.  Why can't the retarded  just realize?  It was Christmas break  because I made my money  caddying.  Sorry.  Christmas break.  Everyone knows  I made my money caddying  and then...  Caddying.  Now winning that  retard tournament.  But one break  I decided to do  that old temp for hire.  Temp?  They tempt you  to a fucking dishwasher job?  Yep.  Holy shit. 
[02:51:00]  You bitches got it knocked.  They tempt you  to a fucking  secretarial pool?  By the way  I can't read his name  something cabby leg  from Wackbag.  Freshman in college.  You don't remember  two years ago, O.P.?  Hey, right?  When this college kid  walks up to him  and asks for a job.  They always look at me  like,  well, who's this kid  who just got out of college?  All right.  What?  And asking for a dishwasher job.  I say,  you just got out of college.  You should be  going for a better job.  You know how depressing  that day was  when I had to walk home  and realize  that it's finally over? 
[02:51:30]  That I can't pass  for a college?  It's finally over.  I rode that  well into my 30s.  Trust me.  I really did.  College boy.  Jimmy smashed me  and I remember  walking home that day, man.  You're wearing  a coonskin coat.  23 skidoo.  Like a college boy.  It's really officially over.  They laughed at me.  You're not going to have  that sweater  with the big O on it anymore.  A lot of you guys  can't see what he wears.  He lettered.  Lettered.  Yeah, the O means old now. 
[02:52:00]  Someone's calling me  a faggot  because I was a caddy.  Oh, not for being a caddy.  Jesus.  At least get it right.  While you were making...  Yeah, exactly.  While you were making  $10, $20 a week  on your stupid paper route,  I was making  hundreds of dollars a day.  That's right.  What's wrong with it?  And all the coke  you could snort, by the way.  That's right.  Well, it was pot.  Pot hidden in the trees.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  High joints in the trees?  Oh, yeah.  The caddies.  We were just...  Well, I didn't really  smoke pot back then.  But some of the older caddies,  they were there forever. 
[02:52:30]  They would hide joints  in the trees.  And all the older caddies  knew where the joints were.  That's handy.  Well, because you would  four-caddy.  You know, you go out  a couple hundred yards  so that you're not  near the golfers.  You're waiting for them  to hit the ball.  Who wants to be  near the golfers?  So you grab the...  So you grab the freaking joint  and take a couple of hits  and throw it back in the tree.  Back in the tree.  The next guy comes up.  That's a courteous thing to do.  Yeah, they had  a whole system planned.  But anyway, so...  That just made me  want to smoke pot,  by the way.  Hearing that,  like you hit with weird urges,  that just made me...  Why? 
[02:53:00]  I don't know.  It just made me  want to smoke pot.  The whole situation  is kind of cool.  You're working,  but you're not really working.  You're kind of out  in the field and stuff.  And then you know  there's a joint there.  You take a few puffs,  enough to give you  a good little buzz.  Right.  Get you through the day.  Right.  I like it.  Did I ever tell you  the story about my...  All my brothers caddied,  Huntington Crescent Club.  My brother...  One of my brothers...  I think it was Scott...  Just throw money at him.  I think it was Scott,  but it might have been Brett,  who's the fine owner  of FH Riley's... 
[02:53:30]  Where is that place?  400 New York Avenue  in Huntington Village  on Long Island.  Who's involved with that?  I believe I'll be out there...  Let's call it Saturday night.  Let's...  I'll be there Saturday night,  FH Riley's,  400 New York Avenue,  Huntington Village  on Long Island.  It was either Brett or Scott.  They both get acknowledgement  today on the radio,  so they'll be happy about that.  And my brother came up  with a sign.  Like, when you caddy  and you four caddy,  golfers hit the ball,  these rich fucks, 
[02:54:00]  and they want to know  where their ball is.  So, if their ball  is on the fairway...  Help me out, Anthony.  You give them  the old safe sign.  Safe.  All is good with your drive.  Safe.  Just like an ump.  So then you see...  In a ball game.  Then you see the golfer  on the tee all happy,  just bouncing around,  waiting for the other guys  to hit their balls  because, you know,  his ball is safe  in the fairway.  And then the other side...  Why aren't you  with the golfer,  by the way?  Well, you would go ahead  just so you could see  where the ball goes.  See where the ball goes?  Okay.  Some tees, 
[02:54:30]  you can't do that,  but others,  when you can,  you would to help them out  and let them know  where the ball is.  Okay.  And if you were a good caddy,  you would kick them  out of trouble.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah, that would earn you...  Winter rules, you know.  That would earn you  a few extra bucks.  You tell Ty Webb  I'm gunning for him  to get 30 cents.  Anyway,  and then they had the old,  you know,  the guy would hit the ball  and then he would  take his thumb,  thumbs down.  Oh, now that can't be good.  Thumbs down.  That means,  that means your drive  is in the sand trap. 
[02:55:00]  Only trap?  Thumb down is only sand trap?  I believe so, yeah.  Okay.  It's been a while,  sand trap.  And then if their drive  landed under the tree,  you shouldn't use this sign  because you're responsible  to make sure  it's not under the tree  by the time they walk  up to their ball.  Yeah, you get that little...  But if you didn't have the balls  to kick the ball around  a little bit,  you would put your arm  up in the air.  Yeah.  Like you're giving the old...  Almost like the Italian  fuck you,  fist in the air,  kind of that,  without the...  No, it's the old man gesture  like,  oh, you kids! 
[02:55:30]  Oh, it's you kids  get off my lawn.  The meddling,  oh!  Yeah.  Ah!  Why you...  So you have that,  oh!  And then you take  your other hand  and kind of...  Cup your...  Oh, tap your elbow.  Tap your elbow  under a tree, right?  Oh, I get it.  Your arm is the tree.  Right.  And you're tapping  under the tree.  Right, right.  Holy Jesus Christ.  So you have these dumb,  you know,  signs for the golfers  when they're on the tee  to see where the ball's at,  right?  Well, we freaking  had a caddy  for a bunch of fuckos  at the Huntington Crescent Club. 
[02:56:00]  So a lot of them  were very nice,  but there were a bunch  that were just asses.  The entire fucko family.  Cheap fucks,  they treated like shit.  So my brother,  one day,  he pretty much had it  and he started a tradition  that goes on today  at the Huntington Crescent Club.  Guy hits his golf ball,  right?  It's kind of on the fairway  but off the fairway.  So, you know,  you need a sign  for the golfer.  He gives him this sign.  The universal sign 
[02:56:30]  of the dickhead.  Right.  Which is almost like  a ballerina  where she would be doing  a little pirouette.  Right.  She would put her hands  on top of her head,  fingers touching a part  that would be right down  your hair.  Yeah.  And your arms  are now making  the head of a penis shape  with a crown.  Over your head.  Called a crown.  Yeah.  So my brother started  that tradition  at the Huntington Crescent Club  and used it  for the dickhead golfers.  So the golfer  would hit the ball  and he's not sure 
[02:57:00]  if it's on the fairway  or too close  to a bush or a tree.  My brother would just  march out  into the middle  of the fairway  so he could see  the sign perfect  and just for everyone  to see including  other caddies  on other holes  he'd give the big  you're a dick sign.  And the golfer  didn't know  what that meant.  No clue.  He just thought  it was another sign.  And then he would  march up like  what is that sign?  Never seen a caddy  give me that sign before  and he'd come up  with some dumb excuse  like well it's  it looks like  you're going to have  a swing  but a tree might be  in a way  it's kind of like 
[02:57:30]  a shaky type of symbol.  That'd be like  half on the fairway  half off  so each hand  represents  you know  you're parting  your hair  and that's where  the boundary line  of fairway  not fairway  you fucking  dickhead.  But he would  march right out  of the middle  of the fairway  and just give  the big  you're a dickhead  to everybody.  Oh it's hilarious.  You used to help  the guys out though  and they would  hit it under  what we used to call  using the foot wedge.  I think I need  the foot wedge  and then you'd 
[02:58:00]  kick it out  from under the tree.  Dude we had a golfer  that was  yeah I mean  you would  just to kind of  help them along  a little bit.  It depended  because there were  times you would  caddy for guys  and they were  very serious  a lot of money  was on the line  they were  you know  a thousand dollars  a side  thousand for the front  thousand for the back  this is going back  you know  fifteen years  well twenty years  what am I saying?  A lot of cash  thousand for the front  that's like five years ago  thousand for the  yeah thousand for the back  thousand for overall  and then thousand for birdies 
[02:58:30]  and sandies  and all that stuff  right  and so the money  could get way up there  you don't touch  their fucking balls  no  and they don't want  you know  they don't want help  the other guys  are not the golf balls  yeah  right  and they do whatever  you want with the other ones  no the other golfers  would look at you  like like a hawk  making sure you weren't  fucking around too  because there was  too much money on the line  but there was a  there was a guy up there  I don't want to say his name  because quite frankly  he's connected  a lot of the guys  what?  back in the day  there was a lot of  yeah guys that were 
[02:59:00]  connected then  really Opie?  because Anthony knows  nothing about  what you're talking about  I have praised  the mafia over the years  let me tell you something  about the mafia guys  that I caddied for  treated me like  like their own son  with respect  like unbelievable  yeah  way more money  than the average guys  they were the greatest  guys to caddy for  absolutely  my guys love tipping  but one of these guys  that was loosely connected  he wasn't Italian  but he was  he was part of the whole thing  he was notorious for cheating 
[02:59:30]  is what I'm getting at  and the other  other golfers  beat him to death  they would play for a lot of money  no  you're not even counting  for the other guys  they would give you like  a hundred right off the bat  and go make sure he doesn't cheat  keep it fair  make sure  no I'm not even kidding  make sure  and you'd see this guy  walking  like it's so obvious  his ball is deep  in the woods and stuff  and you can watch him  like getting a ball  he always wore long sleeves  even though  in the middle of summer  look like he has tumors  all over the place  oh would they get 
[03:00:00]  another ball  you got a goiter  what do you got a heater  goiter on your arm  he would like  have long sleeves  and he would just like  you could watch him  getting ready  like he's like  making believe  he's trying to be natural  but he has like a ball  on his wrist  and all of a sudden  he would just kind of  drop it as he walks  and just happens to  here it is  and you would  just like in Caddyshack  you'd turn around  like holy shit  this ball is so lost  it's not even funny  and you'd walk back to him  and go oh  oh wow  you found it huh  I love when people do that  and then you find 
[03:00:30]  their real ball  the original ball  it's like  isn't this yours  oh no  I was playing this  he was notorious too  for like having a hole  in his golf pants  because then he would  just drop the ball  in the front pocket  let's say  that had a hole  and then it would  just fall right down  his leg  yeah  he would do it  that way  against mob guys  yeah that was  the scary part  smart  yeah  saw him recently  so  he's still  oh still kicking  he's still alright  let me ask you a question  do Caddys get a piece  like Tiger Woods  is Caddy  does he get a piece  of Tiger's  10% 
[03:01:00]  oh yeah  Caddys get 10%  like agents  10%  is the going fee  for a PGA Caddy  are they really that  helpful to the game  they do a lot more  than just carry  the fucking bag  but see dude  10%  yeah Tiger  what are these tournaments  up to over a million  now if you win  so yeah  his Caddy's getting  over 100 G's  for you know  a weekend's work  but his Caddy's  a real golf guy  like he knows  what shots  he should be taking  he's helping him  strategize  as well as  just carry bags  well yeah  I mean Tiger  seems to like him  you know 
[03:01:30]  yeah  they'll like  get down  and kind of  look at  a putt  Tiger doesn't ask  for much help  if you ever watch  him play golf  but you know  he likes the guy  they're close  and he's very  supportive and all that  you know  because you need  a good cheerleader  too and all that  stuff you know  and he likes to  beat up guys  that are taking  pictures of Tiger  when Tiger's  has he done that  yeah he gets  a little rough  out there  but he's also  known in his  wherever he's from  whatever country  he's in  as being  you know  a great 
[03:02:00]  race car driver  is he a bodyguard  as well like  he's out there  dude  I've been lucky  to go to a few  torms to see  and I've seen  Tiger Woods up  close  he's got like  an entourage  of a hundred  people that you  don't see on TV  just marching up  the fairways with  him on the sides  he's ahead of  everybody but then  you got his  personal security  you got the  troopers  it's unbelievable  you've copped  with him  oh yeah  it's unbelievable  when you watch  Tiger come by  it's a sight 
[03:02:30]  to be seen  other golfers  come by that  are really famous  and they have  a couple people  that's it  but Tiger  it's photographers  from all over  the world  taking his  every picture  every shot  they're taking  pictures  I wonder if he  remembers me  I can see him  he probably  wouldn't remember  me but I'll  talk to him  amazing  anyway  where were we  oh so yeah  I had a  so during the  winter you can't  caddy so I did  temp for hire  and remember  the Walt Whitman  mall Anthony  obviously  of course  and remember  they used to 
[03:03:00]  have a restaurant  on the top  floor of  whatever it was  it was by  Sears  I think  or Macy's  or whatever  it was  they had  an actual  restaurant  and my job  for the day  was to be  a dishwasher  for this  restaurant  and I  walked in  and some  douche  in a suit  just an ass  is explaining  the job  and then points  to this kid  that  well kid  he's probably  40 something  retarded  and basically  told me that  he's my boss  for the day  and then the  retard guy  is just beating  me up  the whole 
[03:03:30]  fucking time  if I paid  him in egg whites  that's why  they hired him  just beating  me up  saying look  you know  just  like you guys  were saying  there's no  reasoning with  him  no  it's like  a terminator  so  retarded  terminator  you can't  bargain with  him  he can't  be reasoned  with  so I  started  a retard  so I  started  freaking  the  kid  out  because  kid  he's  in his  40s  you know  the dishes  are coming  through  like crazy  I can't  keep up  so I  just started  taking the  dishes  and throwing  them in  the garbage  they're not  my dishes  I don't  care  and I  saw stacks 
[03:04:00]  of dishes  all over  the place  plenty of  dishes  they don't  need  these  I thought  this guy's  head  the retarded  guy's  head  I thought  it was  going to  explode  in front  of my  eyes  he could  not  believe  that I  was throwing  dishes  that were  breaking  and I  just  walked  out  I  couldn't  take  having  a  retard  as a  boss  an  actual  retard  we've  had  many  people  we thought  were  retarded  as our  bosses  in the  radio  world  but this  was  a  real 
[03:04:30]  one  and  that's  a  thankless  job  for a  white  person  you know  washing  dishes  Mexicans  they seem  to enjoy  it  they go  in there  they're  la la la  they're  singing  there's  not a  frown  on their  face  whitey  you put  them behind  that  soaked  and you  smell  like  rotting  food  it's  the worst  I used  to actually  call the  police on  myself  to get  a ride  home  I was  just this  stinky 
[03:05:00]  mess  what  I worked  at  Chicago  Pizza  Pub  but I  lived  down  almost  in  Northport  it was  pretty far  down  it was  a good  few  miles  you couldn't  walk it  no  couldn't  walk it  so  someone  had stolen  the bike  that I  stole  so I  was  pretty  pissed  off  about  that  and I  couldn't  I was  walking  so I'm  just  walking  down  the  street  I was  just  I was  still wet  so it was  kind of  cold  and just  stinking  and I  wanted to  get home  I was  exhausted  tired 
[03:05:30]  so there  was one  of those  things on  the phone  telephone  polls  for the  police  emergency  call  so I  called  the cops  and said  yeah  officer  I don't  know  what this  is  there just  seems to  be this  suspicious  guy  walking down  the street  he looks  pretty  disheveled  and he  stopped  and I  think he  was just  looking at  a house  just kind  of weird  you know  suspicious  like okay  and within  minutes there  was a cop  right there 
[03:06:00]  asking me  what I'm  doing  blah blah  blah  I said  I'm  walking  home  from work  I said  I'm  exhausted  if there's  any way  you could  just give  me a ride  home  and the  guy said  he goes  yeah  hop in  so he  gave me  a ride  home  how old  were you  32  yeah  it wasn't  that long  ago  I was  probably  17  why don't  you just  call and say  there was a  runaway boy  walking  and then you  could have  said I'm a  runaway  I wasn't  cute enough  that'll work  with Sam  until he's  51  yeah  it's a 
[03:06:30]  thankless job  that's great  glad that's  over  yeah  alright  parental control  we're in the  middle of this  oh we are  first met Jason  I was like  oh my gosh  he is so hot  I was like  thanks mom  wow do moms  know how to  pick them  what'd you do  pick your nose  and he fell out  onto the ground  let's just check in  with the happy  couple  they're making  bathing suits  now what the  is that  now that's  how you treat 
[03:07:00]  my daughter  she can make  bathing suits  all day with  that freaking  sissy as long  as she doesn't  wear them  oh look at that  did you see  that  little  hi  they look  really good  together  I know  I think so too  it's  it's  this is just  too troubling  because it's  so controversial  well yeah  the making  of the bathing  suits  you did  realize  that this  was  scripted  now I  understood  it was scripted  but I kind  of like  the concept  have you  I would love  to have done  that like 
[03:07:30]  back in the  day  with parents  or like  so many  I've been  yelled at  by parents  and I kind  of like  the idea  leaving those  two marks  on the  daughter's  neck  wait  she left  the house  not only is she  home late  but now she's  undead  I mean  they go a little  more raunchy  I mean  if you go  I know  obviously  some of it  is pretty  set up  but they say  a few comments  that are like  I never  could imagine  saying to a parent  of course you  couldn't  because you  didn't live  a scripted  life  like this  is  what were  the arguments  you've had  with parents  of girlfriends 
[03:08:00]  the first  one was  when I was  looking for  their house  one time  I went  and I  went through  the mail  Jesus  looking for  the house  isn't that  the first  time you're  there  no  I spoke  the next  day  and she  was like  oh my  parents  hate you  because I  was like  why  she goes  oh you  went through  the mail  looking for  the house  so I  kind of like  trying to  see the  it was  Long Island  I couldn't  see the  numbers  I went to  look  the father  supposedly  hated me  because I  went through  his mail  you went  through  their mail  to look  for an  address  yes I  did  like this  oh it  says 36 
[03:08:30]  ok that's  it  good  the mail  or the  mailbox  the mailbox  like I  opened the  mailbox  oh you  opened the  mailbox  yes  if somebody  opened my  mailbox  I'd be a  little suspect  too  but then  that  explanation  ok  that's not  an argument  with the  parents  by the way  that's  just a  daughter  relaying  something  no that  was  the  daughter  told me  that  and that's  why  parents  hated me  so  unfortunately  I  never got  a chance  to speak  to them  what  arguments  did  picking  them  up  bringing  no  no I  never  had  the  opportunity 
[03:09:00]  to yell  back  and forth  I never  had the  actual balls  to do  that  I would  never  I just  never  yelled at  parents  if they  yelled  to me  leave the  house  or just  go on  my merry  way  I got  fucking  yelled at  and just  denigrated  by a  father  one day  I love  this story  and it was  just horrible  it was  it's a  quickie  it's just  the daughter  was going  to college  and we  had been  seeing each  other the  whole summer  it was nice  we had a nice  little relationship  going and she  was going to  college  she was going  to Quinnipiac  college  she was probably

[03:13:30]  When do the vocals start?  I love that song.  What is it?  The Doors.  Peace Frog. 
[03:14:00]  Great song.  Oh, that's it.  Bam, bam.  It's a great song.  All right.  Yeah, we got this.  Well, soon you'll be able to stay plugged in even while you're in flight.  Apple teaming up with six major airlines to integrate iPods with in-flight entertainment systems.  The airlines will provide seat connections and chargers.  The seat back monitors will display your video content.  The iPod ready seats are scheduled to rock and roll by the middle of next year. 
[03:14:30]  The iPod taking over the world.  So here's what you can do now.  You can take your iPod with the video and plug it into your seat back.  Yep.  And now watch what you have on your iPod on the video display on your seat back.  Hmm.  Porno.  Porno.  We're all thinking.  We're looking at porno.  Wait.  Does it say video or is it only...  It says video.  ...song list? 
[03:15:00]  Video.  Video.  Well, you can still do that on a laptop, though.  You could watch porn on a laptop.  Yeah, but at least that you can kind of tilt it toward yourself, keep the screen down a little bit.  But you could walk down an aisle while somebody's looking at their laptop and not see what they're looking at.  Way to humiliate me.  Dude.  Oh, I'm sorry, Jimmy.  You're right, actually.  Dude, I used to, you know, back in the day when I was commuting on the Long Island Railroad, back and forth to the city,  there was a guy, he must have just been beaten by the commute for so many years. 
[03:15:30]  Sometimes he would watch hardcore porn on his laptop, you know, headphones plugged in so you can't hear it, but you could certainly see it.  This fucking guy didn't give a shit who was watching.  He didn't care.  I think he'd get arrested.  I'm sure at first he'd probably try to hide the laptop a little bit, but it got to a point he would just have it right there in front of you.  They're going to probably have to make announcements, you know.  Anything. 
[03:16:00]  No inappropriate.  Now, what does that mean, though?  Up to the discretion of the flight attendant.  Guarantee it up to the discretion of the flight attendant to determine appropriateness or inappropriateness.  Won't be done by rating systems, won't be done by anything.  What if you want to watch NTSB footage of crashes of airplanes?  They can determine that's inappropriate.  Inappropriate.  Al-Qaeda rantings and ramblings.  Al-Aqba!  Or don't you see there's some son of a bitch in an orange jumpsuit kneeling, a bunch of savages behind him.  I'll go...  You're watching it, and you're laughing and clapping as it's happening. 
[03:16:30]  Watching the Nick Berg beheading.  Ah-ha-ha!  Clapping.  Your hands are over your head, and it gets people interested.  Like, what's he watching?  There's a child sitting next to you looking at...  Just watch...  Mama, his head fall off!  Mama, the man's head fall off!  It's like a cartoon!  I mean, he's not moving!  Just watch Dora the Explorer and moan a lot.  Just, ah, boom!  Pick a Cialis and wear sweats, or wear, like, a white spandex wrestling outfit that you wore 
[03:17:00]  in high school, and let your hard cock and balls bulge as you're watching Dora the Explorer.  It just opens up, uh, it gives people a lot more freedom, uh, to watch what they want  to watch.  It'll be up to the fight.  You're on JetBlue, it's all about what they give you to broadcast, you know, on the seat  back.  And then on your laptop, like I said, if you're watching something inappropriate, even R-rated  movies, you know, I've watched those, and all of a sudden there's tits on the screen,  a fuck scene. 
[03:17:30]  You know, you kind of tilt it away from anybody who might be offended watching it.  You know, cool about that.  But, but the seat back things are pretty, you know, you could see it if you're walking  to the bathroom, somebody behind you, they could see it.  They could charge your iPod that way, that's so cool.  Yeah.  It's good for cross-country flights.  I like it.  I like my iPod, guys.  How about you?  I got some funny iPod stories for tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to them, Jim.  Yeah, it's funny songs. 
[03:18:00]  Funny things that have been happening while I'm listening to certain songs.  That's what I want to hear.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Like one, no, no, no, they're really good.  Like one time I was, I was on a bus and I was listening to Walk Like an Egyptian.  Yeah.  While a, uh, a gentleman with polyester pants was rubbing his erection against the back  of my knuckles.  And I was listening to Walk Like an Egyptian.  And now every time you hear the song, you probably think, I just drop my hand and stay 
[03:18:30]  still.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Did you see this video?  It was on, uh, whack bag.  Someone put it on.  It's, uh, I don't know if it's a scam or something.  It's some big fat tool guy.  Uh, is, is just some jamoke.  And girls are like taunting him.  He's naked.  And he makes one of the, he, he makes him, uh, eat one of the girls' pussies. 
[03:19:00]  One of the, one of the girls, uh, and he's down there like humming a song and then he  leans back and he's got like a little hard on and this girl grabs his dick and gives him  a, like not even a blow job, puts her mouth on his dick for a second and then takes his  dick out of her mouth and kind of touches his cock and he shoots a load all over the  place.  And they just berate this fucking guy and, and are laughing at like, oh my God, she did 
[03:19:30]  barely put it in her mouth and just degrading this guy.  And, uh, it's very funny to watch it.  It's on, uh, it's on whack bag.  It's on, uh, there's a pal talker or just, uh, no, it was just, I don't know what it is.  Yeah.  It's on whack bag, but, uh, it gave me a chuckle because the girls are just degrading this guy.  He kind of, it just reminded me of big A.  Like you can see big A going through the same situation, just thinking about a chick and  soiling himself.  He, uh, he, one of the funniest lines ever by the way was big A, little C. Oh, his awful 
[03:20:00]  cock.  And the way he would jerk off is he would hold it and like just massage it with his  thumb.  Well, he was on pal talk, uh, thinking he was, uh, in private, I guess, jacking off and  people screen capped the whole thing and vid capped it and caught him jerking off.  If you want to see what big A looked like jerking off, watch escape from Alcatraz and watch  Litmus petting the mouse.  Just that little thumb move on the little mouse's head. 
[03:20:30]  That's what he did.  He was holding the mouse in his hand and just his thumb was gently rubbing the top of the  mouse's head.  That's how he beats off.  Yeah.  Dangle a little al dente by his cock to feed it.  Disgraceful.  You gonna eat that?  Yeah.  Oh, that's one of the, yeah, poor big A. Hey, we got the video of the day. It's time  for that story about peewee football brawl. 
[03:21:00]  Oh, that's great.  You saw that?  I saw some of the footage on CNN.  Peewee football and, uh, yeah, there's a huge brawl in the middle of the game.  Oh, look at that.  Thank you.  And Steve Bartlestein and Laurie Stokes are disgusted.  Are they?  Steve Bartlestein is disgusted.  Disgusted.  Good sportsmanship was not exactly on display.  This is, this is really awful in a peewee football game.  We've seen this before, too.  It wasn't your kids were misbehaving badly, but the dads right here, five and six-year-old 
[03:21:30]  players watched.  Another brawl involving parents breaking out on a field in Corpus Christi.  It began when a coach was tossed out of the game by an 18-year-old referee.  Coach punched the ref, knocked him unconscious.  18-year-old.  Oh, look at this.  Oh, this is ugly.  This is just bad.  Some parents tackled the coach to keep him away from the kids.  Charges are pending against the coach.  Yeah.  Stupid.  Yeah.  Terrible.  Disgusting.  And another adjective? 
[03:22:00]  Oh, horrible.  There you go.  Why don't you get a hold of yourselves?  It's not 9-11 footage.  Yeah.  A bunch of parents fighting.  Brawling.  But she got a little feisty with him there.  Yeah.  What'd she say?  Another adjective?  Oh, horrible.  That was kind of like, all right, we get it.  We get it.  It's bad.  Shut the fuck up.  Disgusting.  Deplorable.  Horrible.  Wouldn't it be funny if he just fired out other adjectives that made no sense and should  get other adjectives?  It's just cunty and niggerish. 
[03:22:30]  It's dogshittable.  Ah, what are you going to do?  The parents are fighting out there.  What can I tell you?  Well, that's why I hate kids' sports, because the parents really are just a bunch of fucking  just disgraceful jizz buckets fucking showing their own dick size to the accomplishments  of their children.  It really is awful.  No.  Horrible.  No.  Disgusting.  No.  Disturbing.  Hard to deal with.  Watching Dick Clark talk.  Next one. 
[03:23:00]  Wouldn't it be funny if she should get another adjective if he wanted to shoot?  In general, Jimmy, because I do go to General Jimmy, win the promotion.  Well, I was Corporal Jimmy, and then I went to military school and became General Jimmy.  I've got to salute this motherfucker now.  You certainly do.  But it's like with the short salutes, like the Nazis would give, like with the foot stomp  and the little arm goes up and high.  Yeah, I like that.  How are you?  Busy.  I like that one.  Hey, we're busy killing people. 
[03:23:30]  I ain't got time for all this formal crap.  Kids' sports, not as bad as you think.  You get a video like this every once in a while, but, you know, the parents are behaving  out there.  It's not fair to say that all the parents are out of control.  I was just saying a lot of them.  No, it's a little more of that culture of fear thing.  In general, there's a lot of behaving going on.  What is happening, though, is like the mom's bringing the snacks for the kids.  Aw, that's adorable.  And giving the kid a little juicy box.  Sunny D?  In the dugout in between innings. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  You didn't play sports growing up, really, right, Ant?  No.  We didn't have any of that when we were growing up playing sports.  Right.  You didn't have your mom cuddling you in between innings with little, little, little, little,  like, sandwiches and snacks.  When I was playing Little League, when I was playing in Little League baseball, if I wanted  to drink, I had to suck my mother's pussy in ass.  Holy shit, Jimmy.  Oh, my Lord.  At least she was there for you.  That's right.  It's nice.  I was a pitcher when I was a kid, and I was just fucking dumpy. 
[03:24:30]  Damn it, you beat me to it.  Power bottom.  He's trying to say I top from the bottom.  Now a pitcher as an adult, yeah.  I was a pitcher on Young's Glass Service.  No, no, on the Royals.  The Royals.  Yes.  Yeah?  Yes.  And?  That's the whole story.  I've been better.  Yeah, you want to tell.  I had a really weird pitching style.  Instead of winding up, I would be on the mound, and I would step back, up, and then forward. 
[03:25:00]  Like, I would just take a step back.  I wouldn't even wind up.  It wasn't even a good wind up.  You didn't have a good leg lift.  It was just kind of backwards, forwards.  You're going to add an extra one billionth of a mile per hour to your pitch with that lift?  I had no, I remember I walked, they had such high hopes for me as a pitcher.  Mr. Ryan thought I was going to be a great pitcher.  Mr. Ryan was a boob.  He certainly was an ass.  And I didn't do, I did particularly well in one game, like against one or two hitters, 
[03:25:30]  but then they started me, and I think I walked like seven people in a row, and they had to yank me.  That no-insight asshole.  He was awful.  Wow.  Walk for!  Mother's cunt.  Walk for!  Walk for!  All right, I'm a fire.  Just pull me already.  Ball!  Ball!  Come on.  Get me out of here, I'm dying here.  Best effort, ball for!  Bases are loaded, no outs.  How do I get out of this?  I could do this. 
[03:26:00]  Strike!  Yes!  I'm pulling it together.  Ball for!  Well, bases walking, bag of shit.  You can actually hear...  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.  They were playing merry-go-round music.  Was it going around the basement?  Oh, it was fucking awful.  I turned around, and all the players had a fucking stick coming through their backs and  through their chest.  They were on a carousel.  The carousel of Fat No Self-Esteem, boy. 
[03:26:30]  Walk for!  Strike!  Strike!  The occasional torture of strike.  That's right.  It's three and one.  Let's go to Randy in Houston.  Randy.  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, Randy.  I was going to say, I was kind of raised how old he was.  When you were a kid, and you were playing Little League, if you wanted a goddamn drink,  you had to wait until the end of the damn nine innings.  If you were injured, get out there and fucking play.  That was my dad's stance.  Yeah, because my nephew, J.D., is big into the baseball there, and I've gone to a lot 
[03:27:00]  of the games, and you see a lot of athletes, but you see these moms, and they're just like  hanging around the dugout, like handing food to their kid in the dugout.  J.D. doesn't get the food and the juices, really, for the most part.  They want to be part of it.  It's all about snacks, and it's just a fun day out for everybody.  It's not a sport anymore, in some ways.  Kids are trained to be pussies now.  I don't know.  I've got to say one thing. 
[03:27:30]  It's like we're kind of knocking that, but it's like, it was funny the way you said that.  Yeah, it's just a fun day out.  Like, yeah, I guess that is kind of what it's supposed to be for kids.  Like, you're having snacks and hitting the ball.  But the way you said that, like, ah, little cunts just trying to have fun and enjoy their  day.  I'm the Bobby Knight of the peewee league.  Just displaying sportsmanship and the like.  No, it's, all right, when you're-  Father should go over there and punch her in the face.  Dude, there's a difference. 
[03:28:00]  When you get your friends together, you go to the schoolyard, you hit the ball around,  you try to get a game together, whatever.  It's a fun day out.  But organized sports, it's, you know, you shouldn't have mommy, like, hanging out all the dugout,  asking if you want some, you know, animal crackers.  Juicy.  And a juice box.  My mother never did that stuff.  My mother was actually, my mother was on the fence, holding onto it, shaking it, going  swing by the swing.  She was really embarrassing.  She'd go, no batter, no batter, no batter, while I was up at the plate. 
[03:28:30]  We want a pitcher, not a belly that likes to have shit on it.  She'd be on the fence trying to rally the other team.  Were you easy out guy?  Yeah, at one point.  Easy out.  And I would fucking, the worst, be like, I'll show you guys.  I'll show you.  Swing foul tip.  Ball goes nowhere.  It's not a good foul tip.  It's I barely got a piece.  And the ball would just, like, limply, like my cock in adulthood, just bounce off the plate. 
[03:29:00]  And technically, it wasn't a fucking miss.  And the coach would go, good swing, Jimmy.  Just try to encourage me.  Good swing.  Good swing.  Good piece of the ball.  Yeah.  And it wasn't a good piece of the ball.  No.  That's how bad I was.  I would take solace in my outs.  Hey, when you were walking to the plate, did the pitcher turn around and give the sign  of everyone moving?  Everyone, come on in.  Yeah.  Move in, everyone.  No, closer.  Closer.  The umpire would do that.  The fucking, they would actually pick the fences up and move them in.  Center fielder's now playing second base. 
[03:29:30]  Move in.  That was awful.  I told you the time that I fucking, I was up at the plate and I hit a little dribble  or foul up the first baseline.  And it was just foul.  And I stood there limply.  And they're all yelling, run, run it out.  And I was like, but the ball's foul.  Run it out.  And I just stood there.  And then it went fair.  Oh, no.  And as the guy picked it up, I started running.  And I got three feet, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got, I got three feet from home plate. 
[03:30:00]  Oh, hold on a second.  Let me just get the phone here because, you know, people who don't know me.  Are you the worst?  Yeah, I, uh.  That is funny.  I got three feet away from home plate and they threw me out and I had to turn around and  walk back to the dugout.  Old chubby, my fucking uniform was untucked.  Would you have made it if you started running right when you hit?  Oh, I might have.  Yeah.  Oh, if I just, yeah.  Yeah, if you actually did what you were supposed to do.  Or I would have at least looked like I was running it out.  But I stood there limply while they all screamed, run, run it out.  No, no, it's foul. 
[03:30:30]  And I just stood there like with my arms out like, what?  I don't want to run it out.  It's a foul ball.  A little panicky Pete when it takes that turn.  And it hit the grass and it went right back in.  And as the guy picked it up, I just started hustling it out like the miracle was going to come.  You hit a frunkus.  The ball went frunkus.  Oh, what an ass.  God, that's funny.  I remember one game.  I was so bad.  They moved me from position to position.  I started out in right field and they moved me in a third bag. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, I was awful.  And some kid tried to steal third and they threw it to me.  And the ball just like my glove stood there.  And the ball just went left of my glove and he ran home.  Oh, what a fucking impotent mess I was.  There are certain people that you know, wherever they are positioned, the second he has to come  into play.  It's like, because it's happening so fast, but your mind is working real quick and you're like,  oh, we're fucked.  Oh, we're fucked.  And there goes the ball to throw and he fucking missed it. 
[03:31:30]  One year, I actually wasn't the worst hitter.  I would do okay.  And this is probably one of my, I mean, I'm 38 and this was probably when I was 13, 25 years  ago.  I still remember my dad overheard some black kid on the team complimenting me and he told  me about it.  The kid's name was Andy Blocker.  Andy Blocker?  And he said that Jimmy's one of the better hitters on this team.  Hey, how about that?  And my dad reported that to me and I never forgot it.  Nice.  I was one of the better hitters on that team.  Hey, uh.  And I wasn't.  Very nice of that.  Yes, it was me and Rick Allen and Christopher Reeve were the three hitters and I was one 
[03:32:00]  of the better ones behind only those two.  I want to start a new bit.  Clean up hitter.  You got to clean up Christopher Reeve's shit.  And Heather Mills where she would just put pine tar on her thigh and swing it.  Oh my God.  I don't know why that makes sense.  She only has one leg.  That makes more sense if you have two.  Mike and Jerry, Mike.  Asshole I am.  Mike.  Hey, what's up guys?  Hey.  Hey.  First at bat, peewee, like the first year you could play baseball, hit right in the head  by a pitch. 
[03:32:30]  I must have stood a foot and a half away from the plate every time I went to bat after  that.  Ah, they shook you up.  I could not get into it after that.  Scared you away.  All right.  Hey.  Yeah, I never liked that being brushed back shit.  I want to start a new bit, Anthony.  New bit?  Called Spy Report.  Spy Report.  Spy Report.  Wow.  That sounds like a cool new bit.  I like it.  It's called Spy Report.  Who could we get to maybe do the voice for?  I don't know.  Maybe Steve.  Spy Report.  Spy Report.  What do you think?  Spy Report. 
[03:33:00]  Spy Report.  What's it about?  Spy Report.  Well, we got Andrew from New York.  He works at, well, it just updated wonderful.  He works at ABC7 in the news division here in New York City.  Wanted to let you guys know that the anchors of the piece we just heard got into it about  a month ago, and they hate working with each other.  I'll try to get you guys more info.  Oh, please.  I like that.  That's what you were kind of hearing on that take.  The anchors or... 
[03:33:30]  Oh, more adjectives.  You're right, dude.  Because didn't the weather guy chime in?  Wasn't he the last one that chimed in with an adjective?  Yeah, that's the famous one.  Bill and Steve going at it.  But now, Laurie and Steve that we just heard don't like each other.  Was Bill involved at all in what we just heard?  No.  No?  Just in the background a little bit.  I thought at the end...  Now, I got to hear it again.  I'm sorry.  Sounds to me like Steve is the issue here.  Where is it?  Right here.  Yeah, now I got to hear it again.  This Bartle Steve is a rough one to work with.  I think they're pretty much saying it's Steve and Laurie.  Steve and Laurie have a little bit of an... 
[03:34:00]  An issue.  She's had enough of Steve.  This is our first spy report.  Spy report.  Good sportsmanship was not exactly on display.  This is really awful.  The peewee football game.  We've seen this before, too.  Wasn't the kids were misbehaving badly, but the dads right here, five and six-year-old  players, watched another brawl involving parents breaking out on a field in Corpus Christi.  It began when a coach was tossed out of the game by an 18-year-old referee.  Coach punched the ref, knocked him unconscious.  18-year-old. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, look at you.  Did you see?  Oh, this is ugly.  This is just bad.  Some parents tackle the coach to keep him away from the kids.  Charges are pending against the coach.  Man, it's stupid.  Yeah.  Terrible.  Disgusting.  And another adjective?  Oh, horrible.  There you go.  That was Bill in the background.  Yeah, I heard Bill.  They kind of went back and forth.  So Bill was involved in that.  That was playful.  Oh, more than a little exchange.  You don't hear the tension there.  No.  No.  All right.  I got to take a leak.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  I have more little league stuff when we come back. 
[03:35:00]  Swing, batter, swing.  Swing.  It's crazy.  It's what it's all about.  Oh, I love this.  Wow.  He shows 36 double D's.  He shows 36 double D's.  Shoving her breasts in everyone's face.  36 double D's.  He shows 36 double D's.  Oh, wow. 
[03:35:30]  She just looks hurt now.  Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.  Her's out.  She just looks hurt now anywhere.  With the Mound Wednesday.  She'll flash.  She'll flash.  Hey, I'm all for it.  She'll flash.  And there's boobs in your face.  I'm all for it.  This is what it's all about  Oh, I love this  Wow  Oh, wow 
[03:36:00]  Whip them fuckers out  This is fantastic  Wow, this is wow  Wow, wow, wow, wow  That's why we call it wow  Talk about the boobies 
[03:36:30]  Take your frog and take it off now  Let's go now  This is great, let's go now  Whip them fuckers out  Wow  Oh, wow  Right  Yeah  And  Yeah  Yeah 
[03:37:00]  We'll be right back. 
[03:37:30]  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Mike, the trucker. What's up, Mike? How are you today?  What's going on over there? You guys rock.  Oh, wow. Thank you, Mike. I really appreciate that we rock.  Listen every day, do you?  Oh, yeah. Every day, baby.  Shit dicks are ripping off Ron and Ferris with the spy report.  What? We've been doing that for years. 
[03:38:00]  No! No! No! No! No! No! No!  That's what you get.  Wait, why is he thinking of us?  Accusing us of ripping off another show. Come on.  Yeah, I'll give you a fucking gymatorium and straighten you right out.  Exactly.  That's right. Dave in Louisiana, what's up?  What's up?  Dave.  Yeah.  What's up, Dave?  Hey, not much. You're ripping off Ron and Fez.  Ripping off Ron and Fez. How long? Do you remember in Boston?  Yeah, we started in Boston.  You started doing the spy report? 
[03:38:30]  We just changed the name to spy report.  Yeah.  That's enough with Ron and Fez.  We used to call it the Tattletale Report.  Yeah.  Back in the day.  And then we wanted it to sound more secret agent-y.  That's right.  So we started calling it Spy Report.  Well, after the Austin Powers movies came out, we decided to make it sound a little cooler.  Why are they doing that?  I guess.  Is it something that they...  Oh, God.  I'm sure they'll be doing Fat Tuesday soon.  Next thing, if I even hear someone call up and say that we've ripped off message board gossip, 
[03:39:00]  I'm going to be pissed because that's our bit.  Yeah.  We're going to start that tomorrow.  Yeah.  Remember we did that one time years ago?  It's been on the docket for months.  Oh, for months we've been talking about that.  We even had a little theme song for it and everything.  It was called Board Chatter originally.  Board Chatter.  Board Chatter.  And then Internet Gossip. 
[03:39:30]  We kind of...  And then we finally got it together to message board gossip.  And there was going to be a song, and as the song was playing in the background, it was  just going to be chitter-chat, chitter-chat, chitter-chat, chitter-chat, chitter-chat,  chat, chat, chitter-chat.  Chat, chat.  And then we decided to just have Steve do it, because he says razzle-dazzle, and it's funny.  Do we have the theme?  Oh, it's somewhere.  All right.  Someone else's machine.  Yeah, let's say hi to Joe.  How did that happen?  Joe!  That's our bit.  Joe! 
[03:40:00]  Yes?  Hey.  What's up, Joe?  I'm in Little League, and I was 10 years old, standing on dirt base, and the kid at bat  just sounds a little pitch after pitch, and I just peed myself all down my great Little  League chances.  Oh, that's a rough one to live down.  Yeah.  Right in front of the dugout, you know, on dirt base, everyone was laughing.  Oh, it was just terrible.  Awful.  The dirt is soaked.  Oh, as bad as you can imagine.  All right, guys.  Punching out.  All right.  Love you guys.  I got to be honest.  I was a pretty good athlete growing up, but as far as Little League went, I was scared. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, B.  I would never get close enough to the plate.  No.  No.  I was scared.  I was a bald wing and by you like that.  You could get hurt.  I was a scaredy cat.  I didn't like it.  I had a chemistry set and a geology kit.  That's what I did when I was growing up.  Let's go to Rob on my microscope.  Rob.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, this particular game, I was 12 and my dad was a coach.  He only had enough.  He only had nine players.  So, he couldn't substitute me.  Game starts and I got to shit my pain. 
[03:41:00]  I got to shit so bad, but he couldn't take me out of the game.  So, after the first inning, he's like, run to the bathroom.  So, I run to the port-a-potty.  I do what I got to do.  I come back and they're all waiting for me.  It's my turn to bat.  So, everybody knows exactly what I had to do.  So, I get up to the plate.  First pitch in.  Boom.  I hit a shot to the outfield.  I get to third.  My dad picks up some dirt, rubs it on my ass because I got shit on the back of my uniform.  So, the rest of the game, whenever I was at base or in the field, I hear the other players making fart noises, like joking behind my back. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, it was the worst.  Any game I had after that, I got anxiety.  I felt like I had a shit.  It was the worst feeling in the world.  Just because everybody knew that's where I was.  They were all waiting for me because I held the game up.  Oh, my God.  You know what?  I think we could start a comedy pyramid with this.  Yeah.  See you guys, punch it out. 
[03:42:00]  All right.  Thanks, bro.  One of our benchmarks.  Yeah, one of our benchmark bits.  The comedy pyramid.  I love it.  See how pale Eastside Nosferatu is?  I think that would look so.  Tsunami update.  I want to get to Chad Myers now with an update on the tsunami that we have been following.  Things are, hopefully, calming down a bit.  A little bit.  Yep.  Some of the watches and warnings have been canceled now for Alaska, for British Columbia,  all the way down even into Washington, which had a watch now being canceled.  We're finally getting some of these waves over some of the dark buoys out to the west. 
[03:42:30]  And I saw a few waves five to six inches high, but that's it so far.  Alaska, though, you are all canceled for now in the clear.  Hawaii still posted for right now.  We'll see what happens as the wave continues to move a little bit closer.  But right now it's small.  The biggest wave they even saw in the Hokkaido area right up here in northern Japan, only about  18 inches high.  Okay, Chad.  Thanks for that.  Wow.  Thanks for nothing, Chad.  That was a non-event.  Thanks for nothing, news.  A non-event. 
[03:43:00]  Do you hear how they had to tie in the local angle?  Yeah.  Even Washington State.  Washington State had a tsunami watch, which was canceled when a little friggin' dribble  drabble wave comes in.  Jimmy?  The news.  Didn't you have one more Little League story?  I did, but I lost interest.  You just lost interest in it?  I lost interest in thinking about it. 
[03:43:30]  I was, um...  Well, you were chewing on your pit a little.  I was chewing on a pit a little.  You were chewing on the pit a little, and you lost interest.  When I was a kid, I think I told this story, but I had this really weird...  I would play mostly the outfield, like right field.  Hmm.  No, Jim.  This is where I'd get...  And...  Last time we started this bit, I literally just walked out. 
[03:44:00]  I just walked out.  Why?  I'm trying to explain something.  Late in the show, it's tough.  It's a tough bit for late in the show.  Let me do it.  All right.  I'll do regular.  I would play in the outfield.  I hate you.  Why don't we do... 
[03:44:30]  We should do a little board gossip, I think.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Razzle Dazzle.  It's board gossip.  With a little gossip.  A little gossip.  A little.  A little.  A little.  A little.  A little.  A little.  That's odd.  The, uh...  Sounded like a clipping in there or something.  We might have to fix that.  I actually have some board gossip.  What do you got?  Board gossip.  Yeah?  Uh, dug out dug. 
[03:45:00]  Where's panties?  Uh, yeah.  I had a fight with Bam over Angel Fuck Devil Cock Happy Typing Girl.  Well, actually, uh, Mike Rowe, uh, fucked Happy Typing Girl.  Yeah?  Uh, yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's just the scuttlebutt.  I was gonna call it Board Scuttlebutt.  Maybe we'll change the name so people don't get confused with other people's, uh, shows ripping 
[03:45:30]  our fifth thought.  I've got a whole butt.  All right, um, are we ready for the line of the day?  Of course we are.  Are we ready for the line of the day?  Please.  Oh, we promised this over here.  Uncensored.  Oh, the astronaut thing.  Play that Uncensored, Opie.  Put them up.  Oh, right!  Cursing astronaut guy.  From Apollo 17.  Okay, and I sure think it's staying up.  You guys are doing an outstanding job.  I got the parts again.  I've got it again, Charlie.  I haven't eaten this much citrus fruit in 20 years. 
[03:46:00]  So I'll tell you one thing.  In another 12 fucking days, I ain't never eaten anymore.  I put them up over the, right up in here.  They ain't there?  Oh, shit.  All right, I'm here, sir.  Yes, sir.  Okay, I got you.  Where do you have my hot mic?  How long we had that?  How long we had that?  How long we had that?  When I said fuck or shit, which one?  Wow.  That's pretty cool, right? 
[03:46:30]  Fuck from space.  Yeah, fuck from space.  That's great.  Who knew?  Fuck from the moon.  I'm tired.  I haven't been tired in a while.  It amazes me.  The word fuck spoken on the moon.  And we can't even say it here.  Yeah.  Well, we can say it here, but not on regular radio.  Why is Jimmy just staring out the window?  I'm thinking about things.  What are you thinking about?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:47:00]  Certain bits that we should do over on the other side that we used to do.  Yep.  Oh, the fan comes busting in.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's the worst.  When we should do them?
