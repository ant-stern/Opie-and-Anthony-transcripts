<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with an after-show hosted by Sam Roberts, featuring Danny, Jim Norton, Travis, Derek, and Troy.  The conversation started with Troy promoting a $4.20 event at Twisted Glass, a local tobacco shop, and quickly devolved into jokes about Hitler's birthday.  A "most annoying sounds" contest was then featured, with one entry being repetitive "pow" sounds.  This led to a discussion of snuba diving, sparked by anecdotes from guests Bob Kelly, Gavin, and Ralphie May. Their accounts were highly exaggerated and sexually suggestive, detailing humorous mishaps and encounters with octopuses.

The show returned to the "most annoying sounds" contest, playing an entry featuring Troy's voice.  Troy Kwan, a staff member and DJ, then promoted his Tuesday night gigs, following a comment about his music having a "rapey vibe."  The conversation shifted to Bobo, a caller known for his humorous, albeit disruptive, segments involving singing and banging pots and pans.  His family's mixed reaction and his planned future appearances were discussed, with Troy expressing his dislike for Bobo's antics and speculating on Bobo's mental state.

The show concluded with stories about Master Poe, a former show associate, whose antics, including breaking a refrigerator, were recounted.  Finally, Jim Norton's infamous flub during an interview with the *X-Files* creators (mistaking them for the actors) was revisited, including clips of the interview and Norton's reaction.  E-Rock joined the discussion, further analyzing the incident and its aftermath.

Prior to the main show, an *After Opie and Anthony Live* segment discussed preparations, focusing heavily on an upcoming "Cat Talk" segment featuring a talking cat.  The hosts recounted an anecdote about a past guest, Jay Moore, who used a Paul Reiser quote from his prep sheet.  Laszlo, a recurring brutally honest and socially awkward figure, was also mentioned.  There was significant concern over the cat's phrasing ("cookie" instead of "cat food"), crucial for potential viral success and appearances on shows like the Today Show and Letterman.  Frustration with producer Chris Stanley over his suggestions regarding the cat segment was also expressed.  The segment concluded with a promotion of the main show and upcoming "On The Virus" content.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XR.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the O.P. and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  There's a lot of action still going on in here.  It's After ONA Live.  Oh, yeah, I did.  Danny, Jim Norton, Travis, Derek, Troy.  What's everybody working on?  What's everybody doing?  Hanging out.  Yeah.  What's that? The sound of paper crinkling.  We must be busy at work. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, I am.  That's how you know.  Did you want to plug something?  Yeah, I'll plug it here anyway.  I was going to plug it tomorrow.  You plug it both days.  You know why?  I have some friends of mine.  You have friends?  Yeah, I do, believe it or not.  Oh, wow.  Not a lot.  And this is like one of maybe three or four that I have.  Not Travis.  No, they have this cool store down where I live in Wontal.  It's called Twisted Glass.  So if you want to go to Twisted Glass shop, you can see.  But they're doing a whole thing tomorrow for $4.20.  You should go down there.  $4.20.  I don't know why.  I don't know what significance that has, but whatever.  Because it's Twisted Glass for tobacco use only, so I don't know what else you'd be putting 
[00:01:00]  out there.  But yeah, sales and raffles and chicks and stuff.  A $4.20 event for a tobacco store?  Don't ask me, buddy.  I don't even get involved.  It's not your store.  What do you know, right?  I just go there, hang out.  It's a fun time.  It makes me feel weird.  I get lightheaded.  I get dizzy, so I have to leave.  It's like a chill zone.  They got some vaporizers down there?  I don't even know what that may be.  What is that?  For tobacco.  No, it's for humidifiers for your sinuses.  If you want to vaporize tobacco.  Jim, you're stuck in the studio.  What are you still doing here?  I'm just thinking it's also somebody's birthday. 
[00:01:30]  When?  Today?  The 20th.  Whose?  Oh, I know whose birthday it is.  Whose?  I know whose.  Whose is it?  Hitler!  Oh, Hitler.  It's true.  Yeah, it is his birthday.  It's his birthday.  I didn't mean to celebrate.  So are we going to celebrate?  Is that what the party's for?  I think so.  I guess they're having a cake.  So are we celebrating Hitler's birthday tomorrow on the show?  We should.  I mean, I don't think so.  There should be a cake with a frowny face on it.  All right.  Bye, guys.  Have a great day, Jim.  Hell of a show.  Thanks. 
[00:02:00]  The magic that is this hour.  Isn't it great?  This is a great idea.  Always moving these things along, aren't we?  Derek, what are you doing over there?  You're just shaking your head.  Where are they going?  And why do you throw that, Travis?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  This is, I mean, you got to keep a tighter grip on things.  He just threw something.  I'm not in charge.  Oh.  Troy, you're in charge?  Those are headphones.  I'm not in charge.  Those are headphones.  You must be in charge.  You know what everything is.  Well, I saw what Danny threw.  E-Rock, what on earth is going on here? 
[00:02:30]  I have no idea, Sam.  All hell is breaking loose in here.  I know.  It's crazy.  Well, where's the most annoying sounds disc?  Is that still here?  I'm sure he didn't take it with him to listen in the car.  Look at Rob Cross, friggin' gifts.  Rob Cross.  Friggin' new Maxim magazine.  Who's on the cover?  I didn't catch it.  Joanna Brewster.  Joanna Brewster.  I remember when she was famous.  She looks good.  Well, we did finally play some most annoying 30 seconds today.  If you want to enter the contest, you got to enter at SiriusXM.com slash the virus. 
[00:03:00]  That's where all the rules are.  I think the email is opianthony at SiriusXM.com.  Which one was...  We're going to play the first one first.  And then the one with Troy's voice is track number four, right?  Okay, we'll play that in a little bit.  But first, this is Ray...  I don't know how to pronounce his last name.  Ray entered this one in.  Again, somebody is going to win $2,000, and you're going to get a whole bunch of airtime out of it.  So both of those things are really good. 
[00:03:30]  This is one example of one of the entrants.  We're not saying it's a finalist yet, because we haven't named finalists.  But it could be a finalist.  It could even be the winner of the most annoying 30 seconds.  Who knows?  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow. 
[00:04:00]  Pow, pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  Pow, pow, pow.  See, it is annoying, but a lot of production value in that.  Did you hear?  I didn't...  That's the first time I noticed there's a bed under that.  Did you hear that, E-Rock?  Yeah, I heard it earlier.  It's very well done.  Who knows what will win?  You can still win by entering all the rules.  The rules, again, are at SiriusXM.com slash the virus or OpieAnthony at SiriusXM.com is the email address to send everything to. 
[00:04:30]  Before we play any more, we've got to play a little O&A material because we mentioned it at yesterday's show.  We mentioned it on the after show.  And then it came up again today so that we cannot let this one slip through the cracks.  It's Bob Kelly snoopa diving.  Troy, you're still in here.  I don't know.  Everybody else left, didn't they?  Yeah, still hanging out.  Where's Roland?  He's usually in here at this time.  I saw he was guest pitching, which was not an easy task today. 
[00:05:00]  No.  There are good days and bad days for Roland pitching guests.  Yeah.  Today, not an easy day.  Why is that?  They just had to chase him down?  He was chasing him down.  They were tired.  They didn't want to say yes to stuff today.  And Roland doesn't speak very clearly, so it's like...  Roland's hoping that he can just kind of roll through mumbling and just get them to say,  yeah, okay, because they don't know what he's saying.  Right.  That's a yes.  Book that yes.  Yeah.  That's what he's hoping he'll get to.  But again, there are some days where it's just like they're in a good mood.  They'll say yes.  But a lot more days where they're just tired and want to get out of here and no is the default answer. 
[00:05:30]  So best of luck to Roland.  I'm sure we'll hear from him in a little bit.  But we have to talk about Bob Kelly.  Have you been snuba diving?  I know you do a lot of outdoors activities.  That's when you have the tank up top, right?  Right.  Yeah, I've done it.  You've snubaed?  Yeah.  What for?  Why not?  Where do you snuba?  I was down at Cruz.  I was down in the Bahamas somewhere.  I was 98% sure you were going to say, no, I haven't snubaed.  Yeah, no.  You have snubaed.  Yeah, I think there's even... 
[00:06:00]  I have pictures of it.  Why not scuba?  Because I think you need to be certified to go scuba diving.  You can't just grab a tank and jump in the water.  But snuba, you could just go willy-nilly, grab a pipe, and let's go.  So, Eric, you do a lot of cruises, but you're not active at all.  Do you ever snuba?  That's not true.  What, you're about the cruises?  That is true.  No, about being active.  Come on, Eric.  No, I've never done the snuba.  I used to do the, you know, you start off when you're younger snorkeling, and then you get  certified to do the scuba, but I haven't done it in years.  I'm done with ever doing that again.  Is it because you'd come up and you'd taken bites out of the scuba thing, out of the pipe? 
[00:06:30]  I mean, they can't expect you to put things in your mouth.  You're not going to have a taste.  Oh, because I might be hungry, right?  You're just going to have a little taste.  It's in there anyway.  No, I ran into an octopus, and I will never go underwater again.  What, did you scare the octopus away?  No, yeah.  It scared the shit out of me.  I went flying out of the ocean, threw everything on the beach, and just stormed off.  Was it an octopus or a starfish?  No, it was an octopus.  Okay.  It was black and purple.  Was it big?  It was about, I think, with the tentacle spurn out. 
[00:07:00]  It was about five feet.  Big enough to do some damage.  Yeah.  Anyway, well, on this day, Gavin, our old pal Gavin, was in.  He hasn't been in a long time.  As well as Ralphie Mae and, of course, Bob Kelly.  Bob was telling everybody how great snuba diving is, which I can only take Troy yours and his word for.  Here's Bob Kelly and his snuba adventures on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  No reason to go underwater like that. 
[00:07:30]  What the fuck is on today?  Come watch on Discovery.  It's amazing.  Discovery Channel and High Definition.  That's all I need, my friend.  It's amazing.  Fuck going down there with those monsters.  When you go down about 100 feet or so, and you get to like swim.  100 feet.  Yeah, his cord doesn't go that far.  100 feet.  Yeah, 100 feet.  100 feet.  Your mic stinks today, Gavin.  I noticed that an hour ago.  I was hoping someone was going to fix it.  Talk into it.  See if you...  Hello, hello, hello.  That's better.  Maybe you have to be right on top of it.  So now I apologize to the people I just slapped. 
[00:08:00]  Make like you're snooping and put it in your mouth.  I'm trying to be...  Yeah, exactly.  But when you snooble, do they actually give you balls to cup?  I actually did...  The mouthpiece is a cock.  Yeah.  And you hold the balls.  And it's actually some Hawaiian instructor holding your head under.  It's in his tub and they fucking throw like little super goldfish and you eat them.  Yeah, a little bit of...  No, the food, I mean like the little snack food.  Oh, yeah.  The multicolored goldfish.  I actually did the other one too where it's like a little scooter.  Ow! 
[00:08:30]  Oh, you did a little scooter?  It's like a...  It's a bubble of air over you like a little submarine.  Yeah.  From your...  Your nipples down is in the water.  Uh-huh.  Like in a...  You can ride around.  It's like a little motorcycle.  And you zoom around the bottom like this little road.  And you follow the fat guy and his wife.  That's pretty wild.  How far down are you?  20 feet.  Oh.  I think 20 feet.  Let me tell you something.  As you're going down, he goes down 100 feet, man.  That's a lot of...  That's a lot of...  Dude, that pressure was killing me at 20.  You got to know how to equalize, my brother. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, exactly.  You got to push it.  Welcome to the world of your feet.  That was very hurtful.  That was very hurtful, but very precise.  Yeah.  Almost like a surgeon on that one.  Wow.  My feet try to blow this.  Wait, let's say hi to Chris in North Carolina.  Chris?  Yeah, I just wanted to let Bob Kelly know that...  You know, I'm not a historian, but I think the Titanic was a little bit longer than 60 feet. 
[00:09:30]  Punching out.  The keyword would be like, jackass.  I know that.  I exaggerated to get the fucking point across.  You dumb redneck.  And you're like a cunt.  How's that sound?  Dude, it was like the Titanic.  The boat?  No, no.  The DVD thing.  It was only a couple feet long.  What's wrong with you, Bob?  He's so angry.  I don't know.  He just made me...  I didn't like his fucking...  He made me mad.  I'm sorry.  Wow, why?  Because you said something about my feet, and I took it out on him.  I went home and kicked the dog, Jim.  I was molested! 
[00:10:00]  Thank you for being here.  You were happier.  Wait a minute.  What happened?  What just popped out there?  What just popped out?  Snooba.  I want to go snooba diving.  Let me ask you a question.  When you go down 100 feet, what kind of fish do you...  You must see sharks and stuff down there, right?  I've never seen a shark.  What's a big-lip-chew fish?  I've seen long barracudas and turtles and...  I don't know.  How about a nurse shark?  Do you ever see a nurse shark?  Nurse shark.  Those big, worthless sharks.  With the fangs.  They don't really bite you.  But they do nothing.  They can bite you. 
[00:10:30]  They don't even smother the elderly like a good nurse.  They bite a lot of people.  They bite a lot of people, Jim.  I'll fuck a nurse shark.  I'll put my dick in its mouth and laugh at it.  It'll bite it off.  You get bitten by a nurse shark, put a fucking gun in your mouth.  The reason they bite a lot of people is because they're real shallow and people step on them  and they bite you.  Well, yeah, they're reacting like, hey, your foot's on me.  Right.  That's why they bite a lot of people.  But a great white, you don't have to step on for it to fucking bite you.  It doesn't just lay there like a big fat nothing.  Hi, I'm a nurse shark, are you?  I'll pick it up by its cock and throw it.  The craziest...  There's no joke here, but when I started scuba diving in Turks and Caicos, that was about 
[00:11:00]  60 to 70 feet down.  Okay, beginner dives more or less.  And there's a shelf.  Don't tell me.  And the instructor was really cool, so he let us go over the shelf.  Ah, that scares me.  In a semicircle and then back, you know what I'm saying?  So we go out a little bit, and it was just complete darkness.  It's fucked up.  And then we get back on the boat, and he goes, yeah, where I had you guys out, it  drops pretty much a mile straight down.  That's so fucked up, man.  Jesus.  You just slimmed down there. 
[00:11:30]  I'm glad you didn't tell me beforehand.  Giant squid will come up and eat you.  I just thought maybe it was another 100 feet or so.  So even that would be, you know, death.  Do you feel like you're falling, right?  I was sinking into the boat.  No, no.  You don't, you've kind of like, you don't know which way is up.  Because, you know, you're spinning around and stuff.  You fool around with it a little bit.  You have to fall out of bubbles, right?  And you're all equal.  I mean, you're wearing so much belt that...  Well, no, the whites are...  No, no, the whites are much...  Right.  I could have had you... 
[00:12:00]  But that was like, that was crazy, yeah.  That's just...  That thought of that is retarded.  And you just look out, and all you see is this complete darkness, and you're wondering  what's on the other side of it.  I was actually...  The middle of the boat was cracked open.  Apparently, this big, huge vessel was on the...  Exactly.  It was just cracked open.  And you...  I think when you let your air out, you sink, right?  Something like that.  How do you...  When you let your air out, when you breathe out, you'll go down. 
[00:12:30]  I don't know the rules of snoob, I'm sorry.  Here's the rules of snoob.  When the cock pops out of your mouth, you're done snoobing.  Do you wear a weight belt?  No.  No, I'm not stepping into that fat joke, can't I?  I really don't.  You're out of your mind.  You think I'm stupid?  I swear to you it wasn't a fat joke.  There's a fucking Dom DeLuise joke coming in.  I wanted to know because...  He's wearing an asteroid belt.  That'll get a cruise ship anchor to...  I was going to ask because I know that the weight belts are used to give you neutral 
[00:13:00]  buoyancy with the tanks on your back.  You wear one.  So you wear one.  You wear one.  It's not like as heavy as the one with...  He took my weight belt and kept taking weight out of it.  He basically gave me a belt with no weight.  He wound up having to put swimmies on his arms.  He gave me a Chanel belt.  I was going to say, he gave you a belt with styrofoam on it.  He should have given you a belt of scotch.  That's kind of funny.  Yeah, that was good.  Can I...  You never get a car crash, do you?  Jesus.  You never get a car crash?  They call me Harry Chapin sometimes. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, he bounds immediately.  You saw a barracuda.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I saw a barracuda when I was snorkeling.  There you go, scary looking.  Man, and they say, oh, they won't bite you, mate.  Don't worry about it.  I don't believe it.  It's bullshit.  I was pretty much freaked out by that.  Barracuda is unbelievable.  You want a fucking pirate ship?  I thought he just said that.  Who told you that?  The bird on your shoulder?  Cock sucker.  They won't bite you, mate.  They won't bite you, mate.  I did that for this tea-sipping jackass next to me. 
[00:14:00]  Did they tell you that?  Why are you doing the mic?  Why are you doing the scrimshaw?  Jason from Rye on the NCP back.  Oh, what's on the other side?  Ant, monsters.  Yeah, what about it?  Monsters.  That's all that's down there are monsters.  That's what I keep saying.  There's no monsters.  There's monsters down there.  They don't breathe air.  You're in their environment where the second you don't have your fucking air with you,  you're dead.  Giant squids.  That shit.  Well, there's a kinky snuba cord.  Snuba.  Yeah, just climb up your snuba cord. 
[00:14:30]  I'm telling you.  That's a lifesaver.  When you got that, you can always look up.  I was sinking in the middle of the boat.  Like I said, I had a big crack.  All of a sudden, you just start sinking, and it just goes dark.  What do you do?  Just start jerking the snuba wire?  It goes dark in the boat.  It raises you out of the water.  A 20-foot, you don't go dark.  It doesn't go dark.  Listen to me, dude.  20 feet down?  I was in the boat.  In the vessel.  I'll be in the vessel.  Is it his bath?  He's acting like he's doing some deep sea diving with one of those big helmets. 
[00:15:00]  Him and Jacques Cousteau just got out of a Steinbeck novel.  It was dark.  You climb down the boat like you're on the floor of the ocean.  You see your eyes, you dummy.  I forgot the second.  Stupid Gaffes said, open your eyes.  Oh, wait.  You're right.  I did close my eyes.  I was in the boat.  They turned the lights off at the aquarium.  You were in fucking Vegas in the MGM just looking at fish in the hallway. 
[00:15:30]  I'm snubing.  I was in.  Let me explain myself a little better to help you guys out.  Maybe you misunderstood.  Apparently, we went down the wrong track, and it might have been my fault.  I was in.  There's a big boat.  Okay.  A vessel.  A vessel.  And it had a hole in it from one of the explosions.  Well, you're going down there for booty and gold.  Sorry.  Lenny and the blue.  And then, as I sunk into the hole, I like to call it the abyss. 
[00:16:00]  An octopus guy came out.  Yeah, the abyss.  And it got dark.  David Jones.  It got very dark.  What happened next, old cum beard?  He meant peg leg, and he put the peg right in his asshole.  He got fucked by it.  That's a long job.  Do you have a bumper sticker now that says, I'd rather be Snooba?  You don't put it on your car, you put it on your broth bowl. 
[00:16:30]  Your game's over.  Fucking homo.  Wow.  You're an adventurer.  Oh, my God.  You're a risk taker, man.  Wow.  Did you also go to Seaside Heights on a safari?  Shit.  I'm tired.  I'm tired.  Fucking Snooba, man.  Oh, I had to fucking slap your face.  Now, wait to see the photoshopped.  It got dark down there.  It was dark down there. 
[00:17:00]  Plenty dark it was.  Matey.  18 feet.  Arr.  Fucking, oh, we went out into fucking a mile fucking foot of water.  Nah, it was.  I'm in 20 feet.  It was dark.  It was.  I'd reached the end of me Snooba line.  Arr.  We go to my blog, Snooba.com.  We'll need the rest of my story.  Two of us went in the water.  Two of us come back out.  You were on the Indianapolis, sir.  I'll never Snooba again.  Chief.  We were floating in the water.  Cox all over.  We had to fight theirs to suck them. 
[00:17:30]  It's not a good Robert Shaw.  Cross that one out.  Yeah, cross Snooba out of your fucking notebook of death.  Oh, Snooba.  Fucking goddamn notebook sucks.  I mean, self-esteem's been smashing that fucking notebook.  It's like the fucking, what's that?  That movie with the book.  Snooba equals sucking nuts underwater with balls in ass.  Wow.  After ONA.  Live.  It's after Opie and Anthony live as Ron and Fez, well, Ron and Fez's crew set up the studio. 
[00:18:00]  Sam Roberts here.  That was Bob Kelly and the Snooba adventures.  If that doesn't make you want to snoop, there's stuff raining over here.  What's going on?  Is everything okay?  Thumbs up from the man who's not allowed to talk on the air.  Now, as we said before we played the Snooba clips, it's most annoying sound time.  This is the last week.  This is why we're pushing it so hard.  This is the last week of most annoying sound entries. 
[00:18:30]  And, Troy, you're still here.  Yes.  I'm still here.  You don't have stuff to do?  You're just hanging out?  Just hanging out.  Yeah.  And, of course, Roland.  How did the guest pitches go?  We were speculating that today was not a great guest pitch day.  Today was what I call a no day.  I wish you told me that.  Because you are correct, sir.  You are correct.  Yesterday was a good day.  Yesterday was a fan-fucking-tastic day.  But I hope you got in enough yesterday for two days' worth.  Because today, not as good.  Oh, no, no. 
[00:19:00]  Today was like getting annually raped.  Yeah.  That's what today was.  Yes.  It was a tough one.  It was a tough one.  There was a lot of, why don't we have this guy?  No, we won't have that guy.  Yes.  Or we don't watch this show.  Why?  I'm like, ha, ha, ha.  Well.  A lot of tears.  A lot of tears.  I hope that some of this that we're playing here on After ONA Live can bring you some joy.  Because, like we said, it's the most annoying sound time.  And those are always enjoyable.  Am I right?  Yeah.  Well, Troy, you had the honor of having, you know, you've been with this show a shorter time than any of us. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  And you had the honor of having a most annoying 30 seconds.  They're setting up the studio.  You've got to let them.  It's going to make some noise.  I know.  This is part of the magic of After ONA Live.  It's like watching Retarded Monkey Puss something together.  What's Monkey Puss?  No, Retarded Monkey Puss.  Oh, Jesus.  I've taken the R word pledge, Roland.  I thought I made that clear.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  I love Retarded.  Knock it off.  Troy, you had your voice used on a most annoying 30 seconds. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, it's quite an honor.  It's from Lucas Hunton.  That's much easier to pronounce than the other name.  Is he retarded?  That I don't know.  Troy, probably.  This guy, Lucas, I don't know.  This is Lucas' entry in the most annoying 30 seconds.  You say things that make me insane.  Well, then you just go.  Because you just said it was hard to believe.  Troy, Troy.  Is it fun?  Yes, it was fun.  When I say something, you go.  Because you said it was hard.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[00:20:30]  Go.  Because you said.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That is really irritating.  Yeah.  Like, that is an annoying 30 seconds of sound.  That's great.  And Lucas may win $2,000 for putting that together and sending it in.  I don't think so.  Good job, Lucas.  Well, he may win it.  If you want to enter the contest, it's not too late. 
[00:21:00]  You have until Friday.  Send your entries in to opanthony at SiriusXM.com.  Get all the rules so you can figure everything out.  If you have any questions, everything is outlined at SiriusXM.com slash the virus.  Now, Troy, Club Soda Kenny is always in here pushing this stupid Facebook stuff.  Yeah.  You have a Facebook music page.  You're a musician now?  Yeah.  Well, I've been a musician for quite some time, but I'm doing DJing.  So every Tuesday night, 675 Bar down in the Meatpacking District here in Manhattan. 
[00:21:30]  Meatpacking District.  Yeah, from 9 to midnight.  He did DJ our pizza party.  I did.  Yeah, that's right.  And you did a very good job.  Although, a certain Sirius staff member said that your music is somewhat rapey.  It has a rapey vibe to it.  Yeah.  Who said that?  I forget who said that.  I don't remember.  Oh.  Yeah, I said it was a little rapey.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember who said that.  It's a news reporter or something.  I don't remember who it was.  Yeah, well, it's...  But, Roland, were you happy with his DJing?  I loved it.  So, I mean, and where are you... 
[00:22:00]  So do the ladies.  So, if you go to Meatpacking District, so that's perfect.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's in the Meatpacking District.  It's 675 Bar?  675 Bar.  It's like 13th and Hudson.  That's by Bill's Burger.  Which is delicious burgers.  It is really good burgers.  Oh, my God.  They have one right here, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, but the original Bill's Burger down there.  Well, Roland...  And those Caminos down there?  That's good, too.  Roland, you would know food.  And, you know, if you want to go check out Troy, I would recommend it.  Yeah.  There's good food, by the way.  Also, Troy Kwan on Twitter and Facebook. 
[00:22:30]  Spell Q-U-A-N.  That wasn't enough of a plug.  And, and, one more, real quick.  What the hell?  Club Soda Kenny on Facebook, too.  Well, for what?  Well, he always hooks it up, so I've got to hook it up in return.  Well, you know who we're hooking up now is a guy who made a huge impact on today's show.  Could be the MVP of the show.  Bobo, you made it back on the air.  Yep, that's right.  I did Bobo's one-man band.  Now, Bobo, how did your, what you did this morning was, it was like 7.30 in the morning, and you ran around your house singing Meet the Mets and smashing pots and pans together while your mom and sister slept. 
[00:23:00]  How did they react, and how has the family reacted since, you know, you've been off the air?  Well, my mom and sister were laughing, but they were a little bit, at first, a little bit pissed off.  They enjoyed it at the end.  I'm actually playing it.  I'm actually having them listen to the encore.  They want to hear the encore.  Well, of course they do.  And, Bobo, you're going to be on the air tomorrow again, correct? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, that's right.  I'm going to leave a surprise what song we're going to be playing, all right?  Okay.  It's a little song, a little song by Old Blue Eyes, a tribute to the city I grew up in.  Well, then it's not a surprise anymore.  There's only one.  Obviously, if it's by Frank Sinatra and it's a tribute to New York City, people are going to figure out what it is.  All right, but they don't know what it sounds like.  All right, well, Bobo, you're going to call in early, though, tomorrow, right?  I mean, we're not going to do another 7.30 deal. 
[00:24:00]  We're talking, like, maybe a 6.15, 6.20 type of deal, right?  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Around 6.20, I'll be calling.  Were you upset yesterday?  Because you were on hold for the entire show yesterday, and they didn't pick up.  Like, you were on hold for literally three to four hours yesterday.  Yeah, yeah, I did.  I had my phone off for, like, hours yesterday because my phone was, like, burning.  Burning?  It was like, well, no.  I mean, we got what we were going to get out of him, you know.  But, Troy, you're shaking your head. 
[00:24:30]  You're done with it.  You're done with it.  I just, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't really see the humor that a lot of other people.  You don't see the humor in him smashing pots and pans?  That was funny.  Okay.  That was funny.  But it just, it gets to the point where you're just like, all right, dude, like, enough.  Like, the kid's fucking retarded.  Like, stop.  I don't use the R word.  Well, I do.  He's not, and he's not.  Well, whatever he is.  He's not.  Autistic.  What is he?  He's not.  He's just Bobo.  There's something wrong.  There's nothing wrong with him.  He's a great singer.  He's just Bobo. 
[00:25:00]  Okay.  Whatever.  Well, we played the Annoying 30 Seconds.  We listened to Bobo, and we're going to keep the Annoying track going because Master Poe  is one of the most annoying people to have ever entered in to the Opie and Anthony show.  Puss.  No, Eric?  Where were you?  I didn't know if he wanted to talk right now.  He was asleep at the wheel.  He was asleep at the wheel.  Ron Bennington, very early.  I went to see if Zito comes in here and sits in my chair. 
[00:25:30]  You wanted to catch him right-handed?  Well, you got lucky today.  I'll just see what he's doing now that he's off the creative part of things.  Is he?  Well, we just slowly have to take more and more things away that make him unhappy, and  I don't know what I'm doing.  I write pop songs, but you guys write heavy metal.  I'm like, okay, do less and less.  So, and then more for Pepper, then.  More for Pepper, who's completely burnt now.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  And going like this every day.  Why didn't we get mooch?  And I can't. 
[00:26:00]  I can't go over this over and over.  So things are a wreck over there.  They are.  But you can't tell from listening, because the show sounds like a million bucks.  It really does.  And today's an exciting day for everybody.  Fez's cat comes in.  I heard about that.  He could talk.  Fez's cat, we just found this out yesterday, says cookie.  That's insane.  And you said-  No, no, no.  The cat isn't.  The owner is.  No.  You said it best when Fez said, I don't have anything to talk about.  And you said, you have a fucking talking cat.  You have everything to talk about.  I know.  I don't understand how you only sometimes find out. 
[00:26:30]  You find out about these stories by accident.  This is amazing.  I can't wait to hear it.  But we were just about to set up.  We heard from the most annoying person who have ever been on the ONA show.  Is this the one that's missing in Tennessee?  Because this is great stuff.  Different Bobo.  Okay.  Different Bobo entirely.  But one of the most annoying people ever associated with the show was Master Poe.  Ron, you remember the Master Poe days.  Well, he was a master of martial arts. 
[00:27:00]  I don't know how you could call that annoying.  I don't know how you could call him a master.  Well, it's in his name.  Oh.  But he achieved a goal physically, spiritually, mentally at one with the universe.  So you were deep in the Master Poe bandwagon.  Absolutely.  Okay.  Well, I didn't realize that.  I saw him beat up.  During so many things.  Like, let's suppose Mars has a knife and a Master Poe would disarm him.  Mars never lived down the fact that he's the one who gave Master Poe the recco. 
[00:27:30]  He said, this is my guy.  Master Poe.  Bring him in.  Do you remember the day Master Poe broke the fridge?  I really, I'm going to tell you the truth.  I can't.  But it sounds like a phenomenal feat in martial arts.  I don't know if that's what it was.  But I'd like to relive it with you and with all of you, the listeners.  You remember Poe spelling his name on the phone?  He goes, P-O, Poe.  I remember him going to Caroline's trying to get free dinners.  He does.  And going and saying, Poe.  But his name was always Poe, Master. 
[00:28:00]  Sounds like you guys miss him, though.  When you start to tell the stories.  So much.  Yeah.  And we're prepared to miss him even more as we relive the story of Master Poe breaking  the fridge on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  What's going on out there?  What happened?  The great refrigerator controversy.  What happened?  What happened?  What's going on?  Well, apparently, the refrigerator was full of ice and needed to be defrosted.  The door wouldn't shut.  So they unplugged it and was waiting for it to defrost when I hear Poe came up and said, 
[00:28:30]  the refrigerator is broken.  And Iraq said, no, it isn't.  We're just defrosting it.  He goes, no, it's broken.  I guess Poe would try to rush along the defrosting process with a hammer.  And Poe.  Master Poe, everyone.  Wow, Poe, what? 
[00:29:00]  Who could forget the wonderful music from the Karate Kid as Daniel's son kicks ass.  I prefer, I think we ought to get Sweep the Leg Johnny as a little follow-up to that tune.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, Poe, what happened to the fridge?  Well, guys, I didn't want anyone to slip and fall.  Ah, it was a safety issue.  Yes.  The refrigerator was left in the back to defrost.  And when the water supposedly was going to go on the floor, someone said that they didn't care if the room was flooded with water. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, who said that?  Wait a minute.  Who said that?  That's that safety consciousness.  Well, you know, I don't rat.  Oh, E-Rock.  It's obviously E-Rock.  Because E-Rock comes running in.  Why doesn't he care?  Is it because he's too fat to slip?  No.  I love when E-Rock defends himself, by the way.  This is one of my favorites.  Because it never happens.  No, he does.  He does a good job when you push him too far.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  Because had we let it defrost, it's in the back office where not a lot of people are all the time. 
[00:30:00]  We could deal with the water.  We'd still have a working fridge.  So Tony is not important.  Ron and Fez is not important?  Not really.  Ron and Fez rarely go in there.  The interns can keep an eye on it and just keep paper towels or towels down there to make sure it defrosts.  Right, but they really didn't know what to do.  There was no direction.  There was no one point.  Okay, one, this is what you do.  This is your next step.  This is your next step.  They were coming to me and they were asking me.  There's no prep sheet for defrosting a fridge, Poe. 
[00:30:30]  Really?  No.  Okay, so what do you do?  I told Bon Jovi.  He had it covered.  I don't know where you came into the picture with this.  But he was too busy recording his name.  Bon Jovi.  So he couldn't help you out.  Not that Bon Jovi.  Here comes Bon Jovi.  All right, Bon Jovi.  What would you have done without directions?  Without directions, what would you feel needed to be done to defrost that fridge?  I didn't want to start chiseling at it because I didn't want to break anything.  All right.  But I was just doing...  Oh, Jesus.  I was just...  I was just... 
[00:31:00]  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Nick.  Fucking Nick nervous.  That was hysterical.  He goes to do a hand gesture and smacks the mic.  Yeah.  What a fucking nervous Nelly.  Are you this bad on Ron and Fez?  You usually seem pretty together.  He's not right.  I'm not on Ron and Fez.  You're never on Ron and Fez?  Oh, we finally found someone that's not on Ron and Fez.  I hear him talk about you, though, sometimes.  Oh, no.  I've never been on Ron and Fez.  No?  Wow, that's odd.  What show am I listening to?  Fez is queer for you.  Maybe. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, Jesus.  All right.  So continue.  What's your protocol for...  I was asking Paul what to do with some of the garbage that was in there.  And so he asked me what the situation was.  I told him about the ice.  And he knelt down and started chiseling at it.  And hit some kind of...  Hit something on the side and just white smoke blew out of the refrigerator.  A Freon line or refrigerant, as they call it now, since Freon is not available to use in the States.  A little tidbit of information during this disaster. 
[00:32:00]  Poe, what happened?  So, Bon Jovi, what exactly did Eric tell you?  How did he approach this?  What did he say to you?  He said to put a paper towel down and just let it defrost.  Okay, you didn't tell me that.  How is Poe getting off the hook?  He destroyed the refrigerator in the end.  What did you do if a woman was having labor pains?  Just hit her in the fucking belly with a sledgehammer?  And then go, look, you know, she lost it.  Nope, it's working.  No, no.  I thought the same thing.  They took the studio mic. 
[00:32:30]  It's not out there anymore.  That's why.  Oh, it doesn't matter.  I had a line I thought should have got something.  I'm like, what the fuck?  And then I realized, oh, okay.  No, we have to take our studio audience mic whenever we need another person.  Yeah, but there's also 11 people in here that gave a zero.  So, I figured that would be indicative of the zero it got out there.  Now they're clapping and laughing, but you can't hear it on the radio, see?  I can hear that, though.  And I heard nothing like it during that last line.  I want to hear why E-Rock didn't get, like, maybe put a sign there that said that. 
[00:33:00]  I'm not good.  Because you're not good?  I'm not good.  No, because you're not good.  Okay, that's all I wanted to know.  No, at the beginning of all of this, it was Bon Jovi's suggestion.  He wanted to chisel some of the ice away.  And I had told him, I said, don't do that because something's going to break.  We need to thaw this out.  Then I told him about unplugging it, thawing it out, taking care of everything else,  and then somebody went to chisel it anyway.  Paul, what made you start chiseling?  Well, first of all, I was in my office, not bothering anyone, minding my own business, 
[00:33:30]  when Bon Jovi happens to come into my office and says,  You weren't in your office?  And Eric...  Oh!  Controversy.  I'm just saying.  You were over there.  Oh, okay.  So I was doing paperwork.  I waited to humiliate him for being stupid.  Go ahead, sorry about that.  Anyway, you came to me and you asked me, you know, what should you do?  Right.  Because Eric didn't tell you anything.  You didn't say anything about paper towel.  No, you did not say anything about paper towel.  No, I said Eric told me to let it defrost.  I didn't say Eric didn't tell me anything.  Okay.  To let it defrost. 
[00:34:00]  To let it defrost and let the water fall on the floor.  And then what would happen is, again, I look always in advance for the possibility of a dangerous situation.  The place would have been flooded.  Someone would have came in, slipped and fell on the floor and hurt themselves.  Okay.  So you decided you'd chisel.  Now, regardless of why, how, who this all happened, what made you chisel where there was stuff to hit, like machinery? 
[00:34:30]  Well, the ice was so bad, the whole thing was filled with ice.  So I was trying to be diligent and try to take the ice out as best as I could.  However, I missed.  Why didn't you, you should have done?  I missed.  Why not just start a fire in the office?  Yeah.  I'm sure that's safer than just a little slippery floor, by the way.  Get a towel.  Now there's my toxic air in there from the white smoke.  Call it whatever you want.  I still call it Freon.  And there's a Freon cloud that is, the listeners are enjoying out there. 
[00:35:00]  That's a lot more dangerous than a slippery floor.  That little shitty fridge, how much water could have dripped out of it?  It wasn't like it was a fucking boxcar.  It was a little fridge.  Didn't you start chiseling in the middle, though, like where the middle of the freezer was, so that it couldn't break the pipes?  Yes, I did.  When, how did the pipe break?  It was very difficult to see the sides.  There was ice everywhere.  There was ice inside.  There was ice on the sides.  It was pretty bad.  Two months ago, I told Dave to make sure that it gets thawed out. 
[00:35:30]  And he didn't do that.  That fridge smelled, too.  It just smells dirty.  I don't, no, I don't smell it.  Is it gross?  Where is it going to be disposed of now?  Downstairs.  A dirty fridge.  You know, you've got to take the door off a refrigerator.  Yes, I do.  That's right.  Some child might lock himself in there.  Absolutely.  Just throw it out the window.  Why?  That would be great.  Oh, would that be great?  Just do an animal house.  Just toss it.  Not even look.  Why don't the fridge open from the inside?  I don't know.  Why isn't it like a thing?  Oh, because they figure if you're a kid, you won't know how to use it.  Well, they do now. 
[00:36:00]  Boy, this is some intriguing radio.  I loved it.  I think we should move on to something else.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Oh, my back is...  Sweep the leg.  Yeah, there he goes.  It's a new theme.  My back itches.  What?  I have a rash.  Sam scratches back.  No.  Sam.  Why is Eric from Kansas City calling me cheap? 
[00:36:30]  A cheap bastard?  I'm known for a lot of things, sir.  Eric?  Anthony's a big spender, young man.  Eric, sir?  Yeah.  Why am I a cheap bastard?  Because you won't buy him a freaking refrigerator that defrosts itself.  That's not his responsibility.  Buy the refrigerator?  Well, somebody needs to.  Why all of a sudden did I become refrigerator fucking buy guy?  Well, listen, I got other complaints about it anyway.  What are your other complaints?  Let's get to it.  Let's get to the chase.  Okay.  I heard about this really cool video about this guy tearing up a Vista DVD because it 
[00:37:00]  wouldn't load up on his computer.  Yes.  Microsoft.  Right.  I go to Foundry Music so I can whack off on some of the porn there.  Yeah.  Right.  I use a Linux operating system.  It won't let me look at the porn site because I use the wrong operating system.  You got to use Windows to look at the porn site.  No one uses Linux.  There's you and four guys.  Four geeks.  There's a lot of people that use Linux.  I know.  Sorry.  I didn't think it was four. 
[00:37:30]  Well, you're a hypocrite.  That's all I want to say.  Perhaps a few more than that.  All right, Eric.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Linux.  Who fucking, who uses Linux?  Buying the goddamn refrigerator?  We were going to leave like a long time ago.  Ass head.  But we felt like we had to do something because all these people showed up.  Yeah.  Fuck them.  I'm going to go home and catch my girlfriend being deep dicked by somebody.  I'm going to walk in while she's got her fucking face.  She'll probably be looking right at my Sabbath poster with a cock bouncing off her cheek.  Let's move on to another subject like defrost in the fridge. 
[00:38:00]  Could someone have Morpheus put the hammer down and have him get my truck?  I know.  Fucking John Henry out there.  Yeah.  Try not to start it with an anvil.  Oh, you guys.  These guys got to come back tomorrow, man.  Gave you some good energy today.  Yeah.  I tried to change the radio station with a wrench, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  After ONA. 
[00:38:30]  That's what it is.  Sam Roberts.  And Ron Bennington is already here early.  The studio is already set up for Ron and Fez.  It's amazing.  Well, at 11 o'clock, we have a very special interview with Miss Maria Bello, which you  would know from History of Violence.  Yeah, yeah.  And what else was one of her big major films?  I don't know.  There's something else.  E-Rock.  You know what they are?  I don't have any of my prep in front of me today.  My guys are very burnt out.  They're very tired.  Why? 
[00:39:00]  It's only Tuesday.  But overall.  Oh.  Overall.  They miss Earl.  Yeah.  Well, you guys, you still don't have an executive producer, per se.  The cooler.  The cooler.  The cooler.  Yeah.  Of course.  Yes.  Our executive producer is Chris Stanley.  He is.  Is that his official title, or do you just call him that?  No, he's the executive producer.  And also the producer and the associate producer as well.  And the associate producer.  Huh.  Talent booker.  He's actually two of the interns. 
[00:39:30]  Jeez.  Yeah, and you lost an intern.  You had to fire an intern because he kept coming in here and talking.  On the after show.  Who was that?  Gabe.  The general.  Oh, yeah.  No, Gabe got a very, very important job with somebody in show business.  He's now a personal assistant.  How come that couldn't happen to me?  You don't have any ambition whatsoever.  Is that what it is?  Yes, and your parents know this.  I knew it was something.  Your parents know this, and they've spent a lot of money on your schooling, and only to 
[00:40:00]  watch you have fun with your...  That's all it is.  Just trying to figure out.  Just give me a little money so I can get by and have fun.  Yeah, that's what you're after.  And the thing is, you can accomplish anything.  And I'd love to talk to your folks about this.  I'd love to have a sit down.  Just the four of us.  That go over.  Like when they had to go in and meet the guidance counselor.  Because you don't apply yourself.  You could be doing a million things, Sam.  Like what?  I mean, I think I apply myself.  I do so many jobs around here.  I hope you and I had a long talk to you.  Around here, you've got to look out in the world.  I've got to quit this place. 
[00:40:30]  Yes, you've got to quit and then come back with something.  They take advantage because they're basically like, yeah, of course, the kids are having fun.  Yeah, they love it because some 41 just walked to the lobby and they got their picture taken with them.  That's what it is.  Because I just went home and bragged about that.  Some 41 was here.  You know what?  Three people thought you were in that band.  Yeah.  Well, I mean.  Yeah, that look.  I guess I need to quit then.  It's not so much quit, but move along and say to yourself, I want a career. 
[00:41:00]  I don't just want to be one of the guys.  But I'm here.  I'm doing this show.  This doesn't count.  You've got to keep moving in this world.  I guess you're right.  Well, we wanted to, before we got done with the bits today, because we still got plenty  of time, I think.  Do we?  Yeah, we got about that.  By the way, Coyote Ugly, she was also in.  She's doing a lot of good movies.  A lot of great movies.  What's she promoting today?  She's promoting a film.  I don't have the prep in front of me, but it's about two parents. 
[00:41:30]  They're kids at a school.  There's a shooting at the school.  They're freaking out.  Yeah.  Cops show up.  Kids dead.  Guess who the shooter is?  They're a kid.  So this is the, and sorry, Michael Sheen, who's a fantastic actor.  He normally plays Tony Blair.  No matter what comes up, he's like, we've got a Tony Blair part.  Tony Blair, yeah.  Get Michael Sheen.  But you know him from 30 Rock that you said you love.  I am a fan.  But it's a very depressing and yet enlightening little film.  It's indie.  Independent.  Yeah. 
[00:42:00]  You've seen one independent film, The Wrestler.  So you know what I'm talking about.  So I know what I'm saying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But, um, well, there was a bigger movie than that called X-Files.  And what was it?  What about it?  What are you doing?  A library?  No, no, no, no, no.  This is a, uh, a segue.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  I know you love my segues.  In 2008, it was like, it was around this time.  It wasn't exactly today.  I think it was over the weekend.  No, it was today.  It was today.  Okay.  It was indeed today.  The guys from the X-Files came by.  Uh, and Norton had one of the greatest flubs in Opie and Anthony history. 
[00:42:30]  He thought when he was talking to the creators of the X-Files that he was talking to the stars.  And he did the entire interview, uh, as if they were the stars.  Now, E-Rog, we'll play the aftermath.  Do they go back and listen to it, um, his mistakes in the aftermath?  Or should we play some of the setup?  Um, no, no, I think, I think it's mixed in, in this piece here.  Yeah, he went through the whole interview asking them questions like what they do in  their off time and if they were typecasted. 
[00:43:00]  He asked, he asked, like, do you do, like, uh, uh, stage plays in the off time?  And they're just sitting there, like, does he, asking if we're, if we write them, or?  And then they had to answer for the actual stars of the film.  Oh.  It was Chris Carter and, uh, Frank Spotnitz?  Uh, yeah.  Frank Spotnitz.  Yeah, and they had to go, well, uh, David Duchovny does this and stuff like that.  Who?  Yeah, what do you mean?  You mean you, right.  Right.  Uh, this is the.  And we do this all because Carter's a nobody in this business.  Yeah, exactly.  He's never done anything. 
[00:43:30]  This is, uh, Norton coming to that realization.  Yeah, this is right after the interview's done.  We just are coming back from break.  And he didn't realize until after the interview was over what was happening.  He didn't realize at the beginning of this segment either until they pointed it out  to him that he was totally wrong.  It was three years ago.  And this is after Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  We, uh, want to thank Chris Carter and Frank, uh, Spotnitz, uh, from the X-Files movie for  coming on and giving us, um, nothing, no information. 
[00:44:00]  As soon as we went to break, I, I looked at Anthony and I applauded.  I actually went like this and I went to Anthony Bravo and I, I applauded you for attempting to,  uh, to, uh, get something going with that.  Those are the creators, right?  Yep.  Jimmy seemed to be under the impression they were actors.  A lot of people in instant feedback said that too.  Oh, they weren't actors?  I have no fucking idea who they were.  He's like, do you find yourself in the role of like De Niro?  And they were looking at him like, what are you talking about?  I don't know.  Chris Carter.  I was wondering why you kept talking about the other actors. 
[00:44:30]  Chris Carter is the creator of, uh, the X-Files.  I'm fucking good for me.  All right, so the instant, the instant feedback was accurate.  I have no fucking idea.  Yeah, the instant feedback was coming in and a lot of people going, I think Jimmy thinks  that they're actors.  I thought they were the two leads in the show.  Oh my God, that's a struggle.  I swear to God.  I'm an idiot.  They looked uncomfortable.  How could they not be?  I fucking was asking them questions that were meant for others.  You just, oh.  One man and one woman.  Oh. 
[00:45:00]  Wait a minute, fucking Duchovny and the bra, that's, that's Mulder and Scully?  That's Mulder and Scully.  I swear to God.  Come on, Jimmy, no way.  I swear to God.  I'll be honest, I never even really watched the X-Files and I know that.  I was trying to figure out which one of them was Mulder.  I am not, I swear to God.  How the fuck do I know Mulder?  How do you know?  I mean, it was one of the most successful shows on television.  It was nine years.  Dude, I heard it was great.  I've just never seen it.  You couldn't escape the X-Files when it was out, man.  It was everywhere.  I escaped it. 
[00:45:30]  It was, obviously, obviously.  Jimmy escaped it.  It was so obvious that Jim thought they were the actors.  I can't tell you how many instant feedbacks came in and they, and they wrote, uh, their  movie should be called the X-Files.  I just didn't want to blow up their spot, whatever.  Here's, uh, Norton asking, uh, acting questions, I believe, to the creator and the director  of the X-Files.  Hey, um, um, do you guys, like, when you're, like, when you're in between, like, you know, 
[00:46:00]  you got six years between doing films, are you doing, like, theater and stuff like that?  A lot of actors just do theater.  A lot of actors do theater.  They do the same role all the time.  They just want to go out and, like, you know, Gandolfini always wants to go out and  do some other thing.  I mean.  Right.  That's the end.  Mike.  Wow.  I didn't hear, I didn't know that you, you said actors.  I love the guy who's the one who goes, actors.  Right.  Right.  Uh, we're not actors, stupid.  He should have said that to me.  I would have fucking laughed. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, you had another actor question, at least one more in there that kind of was like,  hmm.  They're looking, yeah, the typecasting, they're looking for.  Yeah, they're fine.  Oh, typecasting, yeah.  That's the, that's the good one.  Are you typecast as a creator?  After ONA, live.  That's fantastic for two reasons.  Number one, even, who doesn't know what the people who are in the X-Files look like?  Like, to this day, David Duchovny gets called Mulder.  Uh, I was in here, and I see the ignored show prep. 
[00:47:00]  I see it.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  They have it.  I saw, I saw it get handed out and put down when guests came in.  I was having, I was talking to Jess when Jay Moore was in here, and I said, Jay did the  most interesting thing when he was sitting in, and she goes, what?  And I go, he picks up, anytime they pick up the prep sheet, I always get nervous, because  all they do is pick out things to say, why is this there?  And I go, Jay picked up the prep sheet, he took a Paul Reiser quote, and then he asked  Paul about it. 
[00:47:30]  And I was like, he used it.  And I couldn't believe that that had happened.  The other thing that's noticeable about that clip is Laszlo, no matter what studio he is  in, will always be the most honest guy in the room.  Like, he calls out anything that is remotely uncomfortable for everyone, because they wanted  to let Jim go.  You could tell at the beginning of that clip.  And Laszlo just puts it out there.  Yeah, didn't you think those guys were actors, stupid?  This is why Laszlo doesn't have a real friend in the world, though.  And like, wherever you go, people are like, hey, who's that dude? 
[00:48:00]  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Like, Laszlo is the perfect fucking name for him, because he comes out of the closet.  And he just says, whatever you wanted to say, just let it pass.  He's like, no, no, no, no, no.  Let's bring that up.  Let's talk about it a little bit.  Yeah.  No matter where I go in life, someone acts like I'm responsible for Laszlo, and I have  to say, no, no, no.  I didn't do it.  No, no, it's not me.  Well, what you are responsible for is...  Segway, nice.  That's a really good transition.  It's the Ron and Fez show, and today is a show that I've been looking forward to since 
[00:48:30]  yesterday.  Yeah.  Well, we've got Cat Talk, which we love to do.  A talking cat.  Yeah.  And this is going to be a first, and this is the thing.  Boom.  I guess tomorrow I'll be on the Today show.  Now, the cat says cookie.  The cat says cookie when he wants a cookie.  Right.  Fez has taught him that.  Fez also has taught him a kiss.  And I think he's the only cat that can smoke cigarettes.  But we're going to find out.  But I don't know whether I've got Maria Bella at exactly 11 o'clock.  I haven't heard from my guys.  You can see everyone's a little disheveled. 
[00:49:00]  Everybody's running around.  So we might not even be doing an intro to the show today.  Chris Stanley?  Or...  He won't talk.  He refuses to talk.  Oh.  Between 11 and 11.05.  So we will be doing an intro, or we won't.  A little scum, yeah.  I don't want to do a little scum.  I want to, you know, be a part of it.  Yeah, we'll be able to play scum.  All right.  That's all I care about.  All right.  Thanks.  We'll be able to do that.  The cat...  I felt bad for Chris Stanley yesterday. 
[00:49:30]  That's what I was going to say.  Because he suggested you make a cookie out of cat food.  Yeah.  And you turn around and said, that's fucking idiotic.  It is idiotic, because I'm telling you, I know the marketing plan that we need to get  over to get on Letterman, to get on the Today Show, to go viral.  And you can't have the cat call it the wrong fucking thing.  The kids will turn on it.  It's got to be a cookie.  He's got to want a cookie, and we'll do it.  But we can't fake these kids out.  Well, it's got to be...  It's going to be a huge run-of-fet show, obviously. 
[00:50:00]  Biggest ever, I think.  I hope you all enjoy it.  I know I will.  And Chris Carter, the star of X-Files, will be in here.  I can't wait.  This has been After Opie and Anthony Live.
