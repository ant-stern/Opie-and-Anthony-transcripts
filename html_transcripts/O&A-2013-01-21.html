<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast from the 2005 World Poker Tour in Los Angeles was a chaotic mix of celebrity interviews, poker updates, and wildly inappropriate humor.  The show, hosted primarily by Opie, Jim Norton, and Rich Voss (with Anthony Cumia participating in the poker tournament and occasionally appearing via updates),  featured a rotating cast of guests and callers.

The broadcast opened with an interview of NFL legend Deacon Jones, filled with sexually suggestive jokes, profanity, and much discussion of his massive Hall of Fame ring.  A newspaper article about Jones fueled further vulgar banter.  Rich Voss, a writer for Chris Rock, was also interviewed, though the segment was hampered by microphone issues and continued the show's crude humor.  The interaction between Jones and Voss was short and somewhat tense.  Further interviews included Kelly Packard (Baywatch) and David Stein (poker player and Fox Sports Radio personality).  Throughout, updates on Anthony Cumia's progress in the tournament were given by various staff members.  Interactions with Jennifer Tilly, also playing in the tournament, were interspersed with more off-color jokes and discussions of Anthony’s poker strategy.  The segment ended with speculation about Deacon Jones's post-tournament whereabouts, further sexually suggestive comments, and vulgar jokes about size comparisons, with unfulfilled promises to show genitalia on air.

A later segment, with Joe Rogan filling in for Anthony, focused on DMT and psychedelic experiences, interspersed with poker commentary. John Ferrucci was also present. Rogan discussed *The Spirit Molecule* and Terrence McKenna's theories, then played a song called "Gangster Fag."  The conversation shifted to the WPT, mocking Colin Quinn's poker skills and discussing Deacon Jones's poor performance and dislike of Chris Rock.  Vince Van Patten, Rich Vos, and Jim Norton's presence at the event was noted.  The broadcast continued to jump between updates on Anthony's poker game, observations of celebrities (including Macaulay Culkin and Cameron Manheim), Rogan's flotation tank, graphic descriptions of body modification, jokes about Anthony's nervousness, Rogan's physique, Vos' engagement, Rogan's experience directing a pornographic film, UFC discussions, and more celebrity sightings.  The entire segment was highly informal, irreverent, and laden with profanity and sexually explicit remarks.

Another segment centered on the experiences of comedians, particularly joke theft. Rich Voss recounted a confrontation with Buddy Hackett on *Last Comic Standing* about stolen material.  The discussion broadened to the prevalence of joke theft, especially for struggling comedians.  Updates on Anthony Cumia's fluctuating poker fortunes, including near-elimination and subsequent comeback, were interwoven.  Other players at his table, including poker pros and Cameron Manheim, were mentioned.  Ed Asner made a surprise appearance, engaging in playful insults with the hosts, expressing his displeasure at being called a "destroyer."  Further guests included Dean Cain and Daniel Negreanu, who discussed his career, recent breakup, and poker strategies. Jennifer Tilly also briefly called in.  Discussions of the “sneaker riot” and a 2005 show recap were included.  The segment was irreverent and profane.

A subsequent portion focused on Opie's surprisingly successful poker game, contrasting it with a story about folding a winning hand to Phil Gordon.  The hosts recounted a negative encounter with Ed Asner, who allegedly wanted to kill Opie. Interactions with Ray Romano, Brad Garrett (who prioritized bathroom breaks), and a celebrity with strong body odor were mentioned. A female poker player's aggressive style and disregard for the game due to a date were highlighted.  A call from a disgruntled Daniel Negreanu, criticizing the hosts' "rude and vulgar" interview style, was played. Jim Norton's frequent absences for photos and bathroom breaks were discussed, alongside Rich Voss' simultaneous mini-radio show.  A phone interview with Joe Rogan, referencing his graphic past comments, was included.  A call with Jim Norton from Houston detailed awkward celebrity encounters. The show concluded with a studio appearance by Lemmy from Motörhead, discussing his career, Grammy, preferences in women, and poker habits, punctuated by numerous callers, including one with a long-standing bet about a Lemmy television appearance.  The entire section was highly informal, marked by interruptions, banter, and crude humor.


A final segment featured an in-studio interview with Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead at the Commerce Casino.  The conversation, fueled by Jack and Cokes, was informal and meandering, covering topics ranging from the double standard of violence and sex on TV, the absurdity of televised poker and golf, the sizes of various rock stars' penises (including Lemmy's and Deacon Jones'), Lemmy's experiences with Jimi Hendrix, his Grammy speech, the decline of classic rock bands, a classic rock cruise, pornography ("clown porn" and "Sperm Overdose 3"), a UFO sighting, his adopted son, his thoughts on movies and American culture, and the hosts' past firing from WNEW.  The hosts discussed a past radio contest involving sex in NYC.  The conversation was filled with sexually suggestive and crude jokes, interspersed with commentary on the televised poker tournament.  Steve Vai's guitar work and drum solos were briefly mentioned.  The segment concluded with the hosts preparing to end the broadcast.

[00:08:00]  garbage i think a man has to be a man all right i mean you know the press has built up a lot of  things about that well you gotta but i mean the baseball players they've been they've been doing  the steroids make your body looks a different way right but if you ain't got eye hand coordination you  ain't gonna hit that all right that curveball you ain't gonna hit that fastball that's what barry  bonds was saying last night it is a fact and he was saying on one of these shows last night  but the fact is yeah you need the eye hand coordination to hit the baseball but because  of the steroids you're hitting it another you know 20 30 feet probably right well i mean you know you 
[00:08:30]  know that's just like saying if you you gave you gave a football player steroids you know and and  you know i'm sure that some of those guys have been taking them too i mean i don't know and don't  quote me on that no i don't know but i would i'd be sure in all sports there's some problem  with some kind of a drug okay and they're they call them enhanced enhancement what is it human  growth hormones all that stuff all that garbage i you know it might make your body develop or 
[00:09:00]  overdeveloped but what does it do for your football game or your baseball game that's what that's what  the question is you still need the talent you still need the talent and you still need our hand  coordination and it's like if you got a lineman you can give him all the steroids you want if he got  slow feet he ain't gonna be no lineman right sure okay as simple as that and i want to know where the  cutoff is i want to know where it makes you makes you hit 75 home runs at and where it doesn't why  can't you pick up the bat then and take steroids and hit 77 home yeah right i don't understand that  that's what i always try to tell him and he's always saying that the steroids make them better

[00:10:30]  deacon he said not me you know the hair slap might be illegal in pro football yeah but it ain't  illegal in this casino have you been in any tournaments before any poker tournaments no  this is my first time i i um you know i you know i'm kind of retired i don't uh i don't make too many  appearances um i like poker because uh you know i got some friends of mine who a couple years ago we  started playing texas holum it's a fun game and i played a couple golf to them and marcus allen has 
[00:11:00]  a game you know at his tournament are you a golfer oh yeah i'm an athlete oh um that might be a little  bit strange to you okay but i'm an athlete i'm actually very athletic myself i drink i smoke and  i go out with girls is this guy on the show yeah unfortunately yeah why y'all got him standing  all way over there from you is he is he got some kind of disease oh you do know him well look look 
[00:11:30]  at him i mean can't you figure it out he say i stink his shirt says i put that on his shirt i kind  of question that the guy say i stink no wonder y'all got him over there i was actually standing  there but you moved me over and i was gonna move but look what they got you they got you away from  the group well you know i was standing right there and you just stepped in and i moved i pulled you  over you kind of threatened me just by looking at me and i left everybody what's i gonna do  everybody that's my job you're a big man i know it it ain't the size of the sea that make the ship  sink it's the rock in motion of the ocean that means you have a small penis no what the hell how did 
[00:12:00]  you get that out of that how did you get that out of that why would you think evidently you ain't heard  about the myth wait what happened no i've heard about the myth well trust me i started it wait  what did he say then i thought he was saying that that's the no man what do you what what you  can you say that again and so i can try to figure out what he was saying is this show is this show  authorized is it actually on the air are we actually on the air are we just talking are we talking 
[00:12:30]  locally here this is actually being fed into a tape recorder we're just gonna play for our friends  later oh good then we cut him out then we cut him out yeah you got tricked man this isn't being  broadcast anywhere and you watch it you see now how good i am yeah watch your ratings change anyway  deacon's all right bro i like deacon one of my favorite odd couple episodes with deacon jones in  it remember that one he was doing a film in the commercial right you did we did that 1969 69 and  they still play it right yeah that residuals is that residual you get a check from that to this day 
[00:13:00]  and that's something yeah checks for 10 cents the residuals weren't that great back then what was  the shaving cream what was it back then back then in 1969 you guys were you born i was born in the  60s what what year in the 60s right around there ever take a couple years no no give me your actual  date give mr jones your age uh how old do you think i am don't ask me that question i mean we on there  can't you give it up are you embarrassed about it no i was born in 65 oh i got jock straps over 
[00:13:30]  i still got jock straps it is unwashed man you know right off the field right all i'm trying to  say is when you were in a sitcom but you've been on the 65 you can't say nothing to my present no  you're supposed to raise your hand and ask permission we have we have studied tv shows no you  haven't and and again and we have uh we have friends that were on old sitcoms and this is the  only point i'm trying to make like they didn't have the residual thing happen like they do today like  the guys from seinfeld they're going to be making just boatloads of money for the rest of their lives 
[00:14:00]  because they had a much better deal as far as the residuals go the football players no i know  look at me you know what my first contract was how much seven thousand five hundred dollars  so what seven thousand five hundred dollars in 1961 went on five years before you were born  that's righteous bucks that's a mere bag of shelves yeah but gas was 25 cents a gallon right okay  you know what i could go out i could go out in the hollywood highest price restaurant  and wouldn't spend 75 dollars can you do that now yeah he does so you need more money than i did 
[00:14:30]  and plus i and plus i'm retired i said so i got most of mine he has a pension coming in he saved it  stop fucking with the residual money i'm sorry about that mr that's all right  he's gonna call me on my 69 i don't like it he's calling you old and saying you're broken i don't like  oh look at him selling you down the river yeah you own your case he's throwing you under a bus  hoping you can knock him down anytime you want he's working for me yeah i see that i don't like 
[00:15:00]  that i'll get him back though no problem so well i hope i'm not at deacon's table when it what table  are you starting at number seven number seven i'm at 14 so i'm playing too i'm gonna uh anthony's  playing i'm leaving the program you ain't gonna be here very long so you know don't leave your seat  i'm not it's gonna you'll be back over here i'm gonna i'm gonna phone it i'm at table 14  right across the way yeah so at least i don't have to play against deacon who i know is a good  oh you're planning on getting out in the first round uh you know something i uh i don't know i 
[00:15:30]  don't know you're not sure about yourself um um this is my first tournament also so you know  first tournament it's one of these things that uh you gotta have some guts man some intestinal  fortitude i got some intestinal something i think i caught it from i can't see what's gonna upset me  yeah all these people number people i'm a master of people all right you know but what about  cars and give me some cars you got a problem you got a good poker face oh a poker face yeah  remember remember who i used to stare at well okay you don't want to look into my eyes that's true

[00:27:00]  impression  you can't underestimate him you know tony dan's is on test now we we haven't been able to work that line  in about two or three months that's too bad that was one of the funniest fucking things i've ever  heard of my life what's up boss i just got a morgan freeman's coming in where is he please  are you serious no we're trying to get deacon jones back he's outside drinking like a maniac on the  patio is he really smoking smoking and drinking yeah we have no more celebs i don't think we have 
[00:27:30]  any more celebs where's lavar burton i want to get him just tell him to come over here jim's got extra  memory sticks i know jim after the broadcast you'll get all your celebrity you don't have you don't have  to ask lavar burton you just have to tell him you know that old role will come back and he'll walk over  i said get over here boy no well he was in the movie that's a long time ago all right well we were  hoping to get anthony uh before the end of the broadcast but he made a huge comeback and i think  he's going to be playing for a while how long do they play until it gets down to the the last table  here the the eight spots is that what happens yeah so anthony could be here for a few more hours easily 
[00:28:00]  they're all pointing at somebody over there yeah but don't they take a break don't they come back  tomorrow is an elimination i think tomorrow is the big you know where they broadcast the finals  right there in front of us they got the cameras and everything set up so so if anthony wins all  this money does he have to donate it to a charity yeah what happens with anthony's money look anthony's  uh he's giving us yeah he's uh getting a little more cocky just gave us a thumbs up from table 14  i knew he would last uh yes quite a while i might not have been real funny but i had a lot of good 
[00:28:30]  questions today terrific what are you talking about i really didn't like that one he's assessing  himself i might not have been funny but i feel i had some good questions he does this every time  he goes on all the message boards one stupid person will trash him and then he can't sleep  do you like talking shit on the internet i love talking shit on message boards it's one of my  funniest things oh i love it i love getting a little flame wars with people i can't be bothering  oh i love it wait i love it 10 minute break so anthony will be able to come over 10 minute break  nice here he's up oh he's up oh this is great this is perfect timing i want to get some celebrity 
[00:29:00]  pictures perfect timing because this show is dying right now we gave all the energy energy we had  now we can get uh anthony a little update from anthony he's walking back to the table  perfect time for him to walk back anthony hanging in there he just hanging tough anthony hello people  hello beat master men or whatever the fuck that what happened in the master yeah what happened  because uh kenny came running back and said that you took him uh yes i certainly did i took him 
[00:29:30]  silly did you really it was uh it was a big pile of chips nothing real it wasn't bad it was nothing  uh out of the ordinary though you know this isn't the same guy that this ain't the same guy that we  sent off to to swim with the sharks name cameron manheim over there yeah she's playing at your table  she's good right killing she's knocked off like uh you talked to one of the guys that she knocked  off well that's because she's the er guy yeah the er guy yeah is she really good apparently so she's  got a huge stack of chips she's like the chip leader there wow sitting there you know it's like 
[00:30:00]  they put me at a goddamn pro table they're all like everyone i'm looking at is pros and then uh  guy a couple of guys leave so the seats are empty who comes over fucking phil gordon who's just like  you know a legend great great player sits down and now he's right next to me so you can just join in  you can go from other tables tables uh something out so as some tables go out they fill the spaces  at other tables oh yeah yeah some people uh you know if the table runs out you know they they kill  everybody we looked at you when you first started and i'm like you're like freaking out i could tell 
[00:30:30]  there were big names at your table like what i don't know huge just huge names oh what's going on  uh what do you think's going on oh hey you come right over here jennifer tilly hello i'm on break too  hello are you on break or are you out i'm on break i just like you're still in it wait the  microphone's good to talk into oh are we on are we live yeah casual here oh all right okay  i'll just put the microphone near my crotch well so where are we on we're right yes we're on it's 
[00:31:00]  okay because this is satellite all right i'm just hanging in there but the aunties they just started  with the aunties and you know when the aunties kick in that's time to start stealing  so i'm i'm i'm stealing my nerve to start stealing the problem is everyone else is trying  to steal the aunties before me yeah so what does that mean it's when when uh there's a pot in there  there's money in the pot and you have nothing and you bet like five thousand dollars you bet big 
[00:31:30]  hoping everyone else is like oh look the girly girl has pocket aces and then they all fold and  you take all the money in the pot that hasn't happened yet but you get these pros that look right  through you and go you're so full of shit that's right down my very first hand though i sat down  i got quad tens i slow played it which means i really got hardly any money at all yeah wait a  minute i was like i have a monster hand i better start checking speaking a foreign language wow  are you a serious poker player no not really but my boyfriend is so he yells at me like once 
[00:32:00]  i fell to two people and he was like that's the most bonehead play i ever saw in my life so  that's not very supportive well you know he he knows everything he tells he's taught me everything  he knows but i've only absorbed about 20 of it now i'm not a very good poker player yes a friend of  mine plays do you feel that the whole like lights and atmosphere kind of contributes and makes things  like really like you know the way it kind of comes out makes the lights and atmosphere makes it kind 
[00:32:30]  of the way it comes out like the whole the whole uh the whole like pressure of the cameras and stuff  like that oh you mean it makes people behave in different ways yes i've seen people behave um  more crazy when they get to the final table and then they start doing like talking stuff like  performing for the camera right i'm always the same person whether the camera's on or off  but usually the camera's on it takes a lot of people out of their game and my friend used to  play a lot and he said that you'd be amazed how many times people just like you know well a lot of  my friends who are the pros they say when the difficulties is everyone watches it on tv now so 
[00:33:00]  now they'll go like gus hansen will go to the casino and they're like oh we know gus he's he likes  to steal and so a lot of times where they would fold and they you know bet bet into him right right  you know my boyfriend's he's um he's like the crazy weirdo poker player and he says it's kind of  affected his game because everybody's like oh that that phil he'll do anything and so you know  everybody wants to play with him and he has to kind of live up to that reputation now we play i play on 
[00:33:30]  his online account and um people try to talk to me they're like what happened you were such a good  player yesterday now you're really bad i'm like i'm just gonna keep playing and pretend like i'm  not reading that chat jennifer more importantly uh look at jim norton's arm embarrassing all right yes  look at the hair it's very wispy and there's not much to it i don't have any hair in my arms they  always tease me because i don't have hairy arms i i think it's nice no just touch it though just  you know most men have coarse spirally hair yeah but just touch how whisk it feels right there you're 
[00:34:00]  not gonna get me to touch his arms wow the first person ever in the history of this gag that  actually has some sense what yeah he just no they just don't embarrass me because they know i'm very  self-conscious hey i'd love to sit and chat for a while but i gotta take a leak okay everybody's  business oh yeah because you've been sitting at the table i've been sitting i'm gonna have to sit  another 90 minutes if i'm almost dead 90 minutes and uh anthony i usually do the radio show good  luck dude okay yeah anthony's uh he's doing very well he's still in it does that mean i'm sprung if 
[00:34:30]  one person leaves does that mean everybody gets to leave no you don't want to be here i have to go  put on some more lip gloss that's also a really important element of poker is refresh your makeup  every 35 minutes i think it helps you if you're really hot like yourself i was telling joe man right  distracting it's very distracting uh you know i'm at table with laura prepon or laura prepon she has a  show called hollywood home home hollywood home hold them or something like that and people don't  know about her she's super aggressive and so i'm like trying to like um sabotage her a little bit 
[00:35:00]  because every time she comes in with a big race all the guys fall because they're like you know pretty  little girl like her she couldn't possibly be stealing so i'm like hey yo laura didn't you make  the final table at that esquire event and she's like it's me on the information what a shock a  chick cock blocker yeah you blew up her spot never see that that never happens someone's gotta do it  i use all the ammunition at my disposal all right well thank you jennifer thank you and saying hi to us 
[00:35:30]  and i just had xm radio put in my fabulous new car oh yeah isn't xm great i haven't i haven't  received my car yet i'm still trying to figure out how to finance it but they are installing the xm  you're gonna love it yeah all right thank you jennifer jennifer tilly and of course norton has  to get a celebrity photo wow all right there you go thanks jennifer look at that nice ass you think  it's all right it's a little it's a little oh sorry nothing what i we can't hear you you never 
[00:36:00]  have commercials so you never get any kind of break whatsoever it's just like one long ongoing  chat session yeah that's that's it so then we get to talk about silly stuff okay thank you jennifer  bye enjoy the xm when you get it hooked up all right um are they getting back to the tables now i  want to talk you don't really think that's a nice ass do you no people i was just uh well no actually  her boobs are really nice yeah it's attached to a gunt we call them bunts west coast they call 
[00:36:30]  that's a big one dude oh man does she have a kid yeah in about a week l.a is fun yeah  see voss you got greedy and you wanted the picture quick and there was light behind you i was trying to  tell you did it not come out of course it came out no mine did it come out these guys are so  obsessive with their stupid celebrity no we're not we just just well a little where's anthony i  want to talk to him before we have to go off oh you got it oh boy you look dumb oh you just spilled 
[00:37:00]  water all over the equipment rich no i didn't yes you did how would i i'm sitting here with my  cord and it knocked the water over who put who put the water on the cord what do you think the  water did kill itself you knocked it over i'm sitting on the mic don't blame me for that you put  your dumb water on you pulled the cord you guys are fighting over water how dare you yeah well it  comes now now get anthony we want to get anthony back before uh before they uh start up again  anthony uh has a a nice little he's doing great little there we go got a nice little spring to your 
[00:37:30]  step oh that's better i took a leak they're drinking water over there so how psych were you that you  weren't the first uh oh very psyched up on the table i've taken a couple of pots i'm folding a lot  i'm not really taking oh we're getting updates and you're playing very conservative you know just  whatever i've played i've won uh so i'm i'm you know being conservative are you up um yeah well  he just made a big comeback because the thing is it's hard to be up when you're being conservative 
[00:38:00]  because you got to keep putting in the blinds and now there's there's an ante that also has to  be put in uh and the blind bets which go up every so often but as long as i keep winning a few hands  and keeping even and not really uh uh spending the pile paying for blinds i wait for those good  hands and then and then hit them are you feeling comfortable yeah a more much more than i was when  i sat down to start drinking one that i gotta worry about wow that's crazy cameron manheim i know  cameron manheim is like taking pots off of phil gordon and shit it's it's ridiculous but that's the 
[00:38:30]  game you know you gotta wait for the good cards she's had some good ones she's got some balls she goes  all in you know she she calls bets that are that are all in bets deacon jones was one of the first  people out was he after being all cocky oh and wait till you listen to the replay of this mess of a  radio show we had really we had ed asner i saw ed asner i was opie attacked ed asner guess who pissed  him off you no who else would piss him off who else would say that's the signal we get when our guest  is being too boring who else would say that you did not in front of a hollywood legend a legend what did 
[00:39:00]  he say he wanted to kill me he called me the uh the destroyer and when i said i was getting a  picture over there and we sold oak down the river what a creep he is and how we love marital and i'm  getting a picture with him i'm like i just love your work he goes oh you guys are great get rid of  that fucking wasp that's what he said about opie very good listen on the replay it was very uncomfortable  listen to this show and then you're interviewing people you know it's fun yeah people coming out with  card players and stuff coming over the one guy i don't know who he was but he's like 
[00:39:30]  yeah that dude we we don't know none of us know and was he cool though he was real cool real cool  smart guy the only one who didn't fall for norton's shit yeah good yeah i'm asking one of my questions  like what are you talking about it was awesome he was a slick character that guy made four and a  half million last year mil man playing friggin poker the problem is we're wrecking norton's gag  because we we can't stop laughing oh here she is here she is you're the killer have you been 
[00:40:00]  watching yeah no anthony's at your table this is my show so i'm playing with you and i'm telling  him how you're tearing it up that's right i am what you should be afraid be very afraid i know  i'm still playing so i'm not going to get any real strategy out of you but is this a lot of skill  are you getting good cards out there here's the deal yeah i have a date tonight so i don't give a  shit oh really that's the only way it's the way to get an audition it's when you want to part you  kind of not care yeah and when you're playing with the pros you got to not care you're taking  hands off of pros out there like you're like you're one of the pros i i don't know i don't know 
[00:40:30]  something's uh hitting today it's uh it doesn't make any sense to me i have been studying i've been  watching the pros yep i've been watching the uh everybody on uh television tivoing all the poker  channels and uh reading some books so you're surprised buddy i am a little surprised  i'm surprised i'm doing so well you seem to be a little palsy with phil gordon what's going on  there well what happened was this is uh this is sad and i can't believe i'm repeating it because it  is uh very detrimental to my career but i was playing on the celebrity uh poker showdown and one 
[00:41:00]  of my strategies was i wasn't going to keep looking at my cards because i think it's a sign of weakness  that you can't remember two goddamn cards right yeah so i had a a king and a seven a king of hearts  and a seven a something off suit and you know the flop comes off king of diamonds you know four  of diamonds three of diamonds and and i'm thinking oh my god i got this pair of kings and he he and he's  betting my opponent's betting and betting and i'm thinking he's got he's got the flesh and i keep 
[00:41:30]  asking him you got the flesh just tell me if you have the flesh tell me now this is a friendly game  just tell me if you have a flesh and he's uh he's like i don't have a flesh i promise and i'm like  he's got straight that's what he has he has a straight and so even though i have these great kings  i fold my hand he shows me his straight and i'm like great great call on my heart then i watch it  on tv and that king in the hole was a king of diamonds and i had the king high flush so phil  has just been kicking my ass all day about how i folded a king high flush to a straight 
[00:42:00]  anthony's gotta go back we gotta go back i gotta go get all of anthony's money now  we're gonna have to find out how anthony does to uh tomorrow on the program  that's a very good uh it's a quick it's a cliffhanger he's such a sick fuck look at him  that face god damn was that her bo i don't know i didn't smell it oh man that was awful  really absolutely awful i didn't want to say anything because because anthony would kill me 
[00:42:30]  because they're at the same table i was dying to go for that really i was dying to go for that  yes jim jim jim  now they're hold on get her on mic  wow wow she loves jim's uh comedy she loves your comedy jim is that what she was saying  no she didn't say both yeah she did like rich too oh she did like you too that's good the one  celebrity that recognized him he looks like cass elliott  opie opie said she had bo did she have bo anyone else smell the bo did not notice and i didn't want 
[00:43:00]  to do that to anthony because he would kill me because they're at the same table yeah that would  have been an easy target first of all she recognized me she was nice i would never say anything bad  about her but who smelled the bo who cares she's under a lot of pressure playing black uh poker  poker what did romano say i saw you talking to ray romano ray said uh if you ray go ray said if you  lose do you have to come over here i go yeah he goes well that'll give me more incentive to win  brad garrett we saw walk by yeah we've got a lot of the big stars though who haven't we gotten 
[00:43:30]  besides macaulay culkin ken we've done we we did pretty well today i'm trying to get that little  creep but uh what about deacon jones we got to end the show with deacon we only have like four or  five minutes left in the show he's probably doing an episode of cops right now he's that hammered  yeah i i you know he's on the patio is he he's out of his mind what were we gonna say  uh no i tried to get brad gabbert uh garrett and ray romano but they wanted to go to the bathroom  instead okay all right they're getting uh so you couldn't get romano or brad garrett 
[00:44:00]  no all right no i'm trying though maybe we'll eat later have something with parmesan cheese on it  all right thanks i am hungry all right well you and your wrong your wrong word egg sense  they're uh while i was ahead on that one they have begun dealing the cards again four times a charm  anthony's back in what are we gonna do tonight are you you're gonna do you're gonna direct the porno  right i'm probably gonna direct the porno the golden shower thing joe's gonna either beat someone  up or float somewhere do a little floating right what do you i think uh master poe's gonna come to

[00:51:00]  because he hangs out with the guy down the hall anyway joe rogan is here and we're live in los  angeles in the year of 2005 here it is it's the worst of the opian anthony show joe rogan joe rogan  for fear factor rogan how you been man what's up joe what's up joe what's up joe see you man  oh man joe you playing today or are you just coming by i don't play cards i just came here for  you guys you don't play poker no i don't play any games yeah well i used to play quake online i was  addicted quake i get really addicted to games i used to play pool like 10 hours a day yeah i got addicted 
[00:51:30]  to that so yeah i i i don't have i don't have the personality for poker i would i would have to be  all in all the time i would i'd be out so fast as everyone says that works every time but one oh  i understand going all in so joe it's it's really funny you you've made one appearance on our new  show so far and you heard you remember what happened yeah yeah the sound cut out uh you were  telling the uh the story about doug stanhope almost dying i i probably had a point somewhere in there  but here's the deal you've got to finish the story because the message boards have gone crazy people 
[00:52:00]  are wondering what was the end of that story oh okay because you remember like we i'll just tell you  what when last we left doug what the funny part of it was well just give the it was just just i thought doug  i thought doug was dead right what was the drug it's called dmt it's dimethyltryptamine and it's  it's actually produced by your pineal gland it's like the most powerful psychedelic known to man  powerful it's uh it's like uh it's like if you've ever done acid you ever done mushrooms it's that  times like a hundred thousand it's like being shot through a cannon to the center of the universe it's 
[00:52:30]  the craziest feeling ever and when you come out of it you really like understand everything and it  only lasts for like a few minutes where you really feel like you understand everything and then your  ego grabs a hold of you and you start redefining your environment and everything again but but  during that experience while it's going on you really understand everything you're not afraid  of death you're not afraid of life you you understand that it all just cycles together you're a part of  everything you feel connected to the air and the fucking table and glasses it's the most insane and 
[00:53:00]  most enlightened experience and hermit has we're talking to hermit has so doug is lying on the couch and i  give it to doug and doug's body is a fucking dumpster i love doug but doug smokes as many cigarettes as  he can get so you're like he doesn't count like i need a fucking another pack it's like not like oh  i'm trying to cut back it's like can i get another cigarette in my mouth oh there's a cigarette let me  like that there's a beer oh that's another beer you've had 18 oh it's another beer look it's a beer  right there i'll just drink it he doesn't worry at all so and he's taking this shit and i've seen a  bunch of people do it but i've never seen anybody react like doug doug started moaning and drools 
[00:53:30]  coming out of his mouth he's going i'm going fuck he's dead and then i'm like shit he's so funny  and then i'm like shit what am i gonna do with the body because i'm not telling people all this  racing through your head i gave doug dimethyl trip to me and he died on my fucking couch no i'm digging  a hole in the woods he would appreciate that i mean if that was me if i died at his house i'd  expect him to do the same don't fucking tell the cops killed me just bury me i'm dead you're fucked up  it's over right just let's get rid of me i died enlightened anyway he came out of it he was now 
[00:54:00]  and then he bought it me now he does it all the time he's he's like we need to experiment more with  this well is it like a drug or does it just tap into that part of you that makes your body create  it's it's it's forcing that chemical into your brain but it's a natural chemical that exists in  your brain and they think it's responsible for all these alien abduction experiences that people  have that what they are is actually dmt spikes oh wow and that it happens because they all happen  during dream time they all happen while you're asleep and they they happen a lot of them are 
[00:54:30]  very similar stories and there's a guy named um uh rick strassman he wrote a book called the spirit  molecule and it's all on dmt and he he was the only man to ever conduct a bunch of clinical uh  you know all the all these different tests and experiments on dmt where they shot it intramuscularly  they made people smoke it all these different ways can you can eat it if you eat it with an mao  inhibitor you know and they did all these different types of uh experiments with dmt and they they had  very similar experiences to people who had alien abduction experiences so he believes as crazy as  it sounds that what dmt is really is it's a portal to another dimension that it tunes you into another 
[00:55:00]  frequency because the people share experiences yeah that's the craziest thing i know that sounds  nuts but people if you if we all did dmt together we would see the same shit we'd be like dude what the  fuck is that really there's a guy talking to us there's this little you ever heard of terrence  mckenna do you know terrence mckenna's no no a brilliant guy who was a uh uh you know uh what you call  a psychonaut you know one of those timothy leary type guys who just lived his whole life tripping  and learning from the experiences and writing books about it and and talking about the benefits of 
[00:55:30]  mushrooms and he actually believes that mushrooms and uh psilocybin and hallucinogenics in general  were responsible for human evolution and he's got like scientific points to it like psilocybin and  low doses actually increases visual visual acuity and it makes you hornier and that would make like a  more successful predator and he's got all these different it's fascinating fascinating shit but it's all about  you know the all these stories and all it's all about like losing the ego through the psychedelic  experience wow jesus that's heavy dude once you start doing it it's really heavy and you know what 
[00:56:00]  it doesn't it doesn't make you stupid you don't feel like shit you wake up in the morning you're not  hung over and you look at everything differently i don't recommend it for everybody it's not for  idiots why don't we do it and uh do a radio show that actually sounded like a rousing endorsement  listen i brought something in just for you guys this is just for you guys i got this a long time  and i saved it and i brought in just for you guys because you're the only ones who can play it  because it's xm radio this is a hardcore gangster rapper called gangster fag all right look at this  check this out it's a guy who talks about sucking my man's dick is that fucking niggas in the ass

[01:04:30]  the big part of the game it's it's it's winning like psychological warfare it is and you know what  it is truly playing players and not your cards i don't care what i get i want to understand what  you have because if i don't think you have anything i'm going to win that pot i'm going to take pots  that aren't mine that's the essence of poker good poker see that's the problem i would just i would  just keep i would just keep no patience yeah no patience and i i don't want that guy to get the  upper hand on me so even if i have a bad hand and he keeps raising the pot i'm i'm in every time  because i i can't let someone do that to me yeah you know yeah that's kind of a sucker play you want

[01:07:30]  great poker player you either have it or don't right well you can acting skills and the gimmick yeah  do you teach gimmicks yeah you do there's so many elements to becoming a very good poker player  you can't learn it in two days but we're going to try to teach people as much as we can  and uh this event's going to be great celebrities going against the best poker pros in the world  celebrities for the first time unlike like golf you know celebrity events and tennis events where  they they don't get that very they don't get excited they truly get excited playing with the 
[01:08:00]  best players in the world let me let me ask you i don't i don't really play poker but do you think  that this my friend was telling me that this whole thing here is very different because he's like man  just the attitudes and um this like the whole vibe here well you know it's uh i think the poker pros  want to win that i mean there's real money going at stake here i think it's 150 000 or 250 000 to win  it right so the crows want to win this they're hungry and the celebrities would love to win and 
[01:08:30]  put it to the charity there's a charity that plays all right okay when they went trying to get  celebrities do you think uh picking the week of the oscars was a bad week you know no you know  all the celebrities they love to play it i think we got a great bunch out there you know i saw the  lady from the practice yeah oh yeah camera manheim you know oh she's out there oh wow we gotta let you  go don't you have to get to your table i'll get out there nice to see you guys when you get knocked  out come on back and say hi to us wait i want to get a picture with you all right well get your  picture now that's the best isn't it sorry buddy that's the most uncomfortable thing ever 
[01:09:00]  what's up rich nothing just walking around here this is gonna oh i see anthony anthony is already  freaked out i could tell look what's your big deal hi anthony anthony that's all embarrassing  look here's retard friends yelling from the car yeah we're about 30 feet away good luck on the  date right luke oscett jr is making him do leg lifts on a roof and we're mooning him as the boat goes by 
[01:09:30]  anthony anthony just gave the universal sign of done he just did that what's your big deal  he recognized one of the one of the pros is right there right pro pro right there he looks nervous  doesn't he yeah yeah he's losing his mind he's playing poker how could you be nervous i don't  get it because he's playing against pros and he's being a big deal you get cards dealt to you if  they're good you win richard he's pointed to that guy that has his back turned to us yeah i'm so done 
[01:10:00]  so obviously he's been uh thrown on a table that has a real pro so i think anthony will be back i don't  know broadcast in uh 10 minutes they're about to begin uh kenny what's up club soda kenny anthony's  sitting with a poker pro called men the master yeah back down a little bit men the master what  is his name he's sitting with a pro called men the master that's the club norton was in the other  night now club soda kenny uh escorted anthony to the table what was the vibe is he feeling it 
[01:10:30]  he's getting nervous i i tried to psych him up oh my god he's uh one of the asian pros he's at his  table oh great you'll never know how you can play the blank stare you can't tell if he's happy or  crying how can you play savager without smoking cigarettes well if you're a smoker that's half the  game you don't let him smoke in here no how do you play uh that's so weak one of the guys we had on  the program said that's the difference between playing online and you know in one of these 
[01:11:00]  atmospheres you can't smoke uh during these during these tournaments and some of these people freak  out because they need a cigarette do most of these guys spend their time playing online this guy who's  supposed to uh sit down with anthony and he's so good he's not even sitting yet what would it be  he's talking to his friend who the asian guy yeah so is most of these guys they play online is that's  how they get their action in they practice online you guys probably play in vegas i'm guessing most  of the pros right you can make a lot of money online apparently right you put up your credit card  and it's illegal gambling yeah anthony plays online a little bit here and there but the real players 
[01:11:30]  don't play online they're too busy no no they're too busy like going all over the world uh to enter  these tournaments i wouldn't trust online though because you never know the computer is just  generating and beating everybody i wouldn't trust that i like to play with people can it do that  i'm sure it could online if you're playing just like a slot machine you know slot machines are not  accurate yeah but those things so i guess like the server would have to be rigged somebody in the  middle would have to rig and they would decide who would i gotta break in here because uh you know  i've known anthony for 10 years he is out of his mind nervous right now he's like he's like doing 
[01:12:00]  this with his hands and what look at him we found anthony's gimmick by the way just shake like a girl  he's finished cameron manheim from the practices at anthony's table yeah cool and some guy the one  that looks like lithgow from garb and eric uh paladino which one is eric paladino uh from er right  wait where's um where's uh what's like uh gabe kaplan where's ed asner did you hear that anthony peed  right next to ed asner in the bathroom oh he's here yeah where is he anthony's uh i want to ask 
[01:12:30]  anthony if you saw ed asner's hog he said yeah it hung to the left  all right well anthony is giving us a look like save my seat boys i'll be back in a few minutes  that'd be funny to get knocked out i know i you know it's funny because anthony watches a lot of  the poker on tv he knows all the professionals i couldn't i i wouldn't recognize one of these  dude i don't give a fuck about those cards look at that chick which was the chick who's got her her  like shirt like hanging over sleeves to let you to give you the impression that she's sort of

[01:14:30]  really good people here tonight what do they have is it uh mimi rogers here i don't know mimi rogers  mimi mimi rogers yeah i guess so uh mac culkin that's all right called the gravity of michael  jackson he ain't coming over here right ben huh where is he even see him are we gonna get more  of these celebrities after they get how old is macaulay culkin now like uh 15 i think why wouldn't  he be on do they have to put their own money up for this no i don't know we don't charity yeah we 
[01:15:00]  didn't have to i think xm uh threw in the 25 000 entry fee sure i was talking to um joe you know  while we were in break he has a flotation tank and i want to get one of these from my apartment  what's he do have you ever floated before no you would try it no you wouldn't you wouldn't try the  floor it's a sensory deprivation it's claustrophobic gigantic tank of water that has uh it's it's got  like 800 pounds of salt in it and so you float and the temperature of the water is the same 
[01:15:30]  temperature as your skin it's 93.5 degrees and it's total silence total darkness and you float in  there and you're all the senses are gone you don't see anything feel anything touch anything no sense  of distance and your mind starts just going into crazy places it's the wildest experience you'll  ever have in your life it's like a psychedelic experience without taking any drugs how long do  you have to stay there for as long as you want you know i go in there for a couple hours at a time  is it for relaxation or men it's for everything relaxation it gives you a much more objective  look at life than i think you ever possibly can have just walking around and your mind is always 
[01:16:00]  dealing with shit you're always dealing with noise and people talking to you and what everyone needs  and sounds and touch and and when when you're in that tank all that shit's gone your mind is like  on hyperspeed because your mind doesn't have to deal with any sensory input so it's just it opens up  like you can think so much clear it's phenomenal it's the most phenomenal physical experience you can  have it's like floating through the universe yeah you just float i did it once uh when i was working  in rochester it's amazing absolutely the first time you don't get the hang of it you got to do it a 
[01:16:30]  bunch of times to relax you get comfortable yeah you're so freaked out because it's completely dark and  after a while you really feel like you're just floating in space well not only that you have  to learn how to manage your mind because your mind starts doing busy work like you'll start going  goddamn i got a fucking itch on my nose but you don't have an itch on your nose it's just your  mind can't believe you're not doing anything so your mind wants you to start doing shit so you're  like fuck i want to itch my balls but if you itch yourself and you're totally naked the salt the water  is very salty so anytime any any place you touch is not a good idea because you'll start feeling that  it's itchy and salty so you got to just chill and so it takes a few times to get used to just chilling 
[01:17:00]  you don't start freaking from it do you you don't start like no i go in there i go in there really  fucking high i smoke like four or five hits of like sick chronic and get in there and just it's the  wildest experience ever it's like it's it's it's literally like you cease to exist is that wild  yeah i don't like you feel that way every day would you do that or what i don't know i don't like  rich's hurtful comment what'd you say i don't know he's to exist every day rich is implying that i kind 
[01:17:30]  of live in one of those soul-filled things with my fat tits just bobbing around in cyberspace  somewhere meaning nothing to anybody i mean that's kind of what he was saying i think  can you pump in some music too you can if you want i don't dark side of the moon it has speakers  installed in it you know they're underneath the water i i would imagine you have to pick the right  music though yeah you you know what you don't want to do that you don't want to have any input man  you just want to just do it we could do it together can't we yeah just two men sitting there  getting salty what's going on club soda county another pro just sat down at anthony's table 
[01:18:00]  the female annie duke in that pink shirt with the gray sleeves oh cool she won like the high low game  of the uh poker thing so getting beat by a chick in poker is a lot like getting beat by a chicken pool  you don't really want that to happen i just saw jennifer tilly just walked in brad garrett ray romano  so romano yeah ray romano who's that i don't know he's on that show what show i don't know  everybody loves romano all right have they started dealing the cards yeah they're playing 
[01:18:30]  anthony's being very conservative from what i could say what is he doing is he doing anything  he's gotta know when to hold them know when to fold them no dude hey jumps the mic and walks away  he knows that's awful we get any celebrities over here i know when to punch out and slam the mic down  i want some pictures huh well you'll look at the pictures later after the radio show he's the  biggest he's the biggest celebrity here i want ed asner dude i was in marital amore oh yeah i am so

[01:29:00]  in on that obviously he's comfortable yeah he's starting to relax a little bit he knows we're  talking about him right now he's just kind of nodding his head he's got a big shitty grin look at him  i wish we had like some special like uh signs that what oh now he's he's hanging in there though  all right we got rich voss at uh at the broadcast center here he brought his lovely fiancee rich uh  yeah rich mcparland rich got engaged well you laugh look at the beautiful rock  on her hands very attractive lady she's beautiful very funny too very funny a great writer 
[01:29:30]  you know i'm a lucky man all right you're a really romantic guy too the way you did it that was  really nice yeah i took her to the diner yeah why don't you tell joe how you how you did this whole  thing i uh she flew in from l.a yeah she flew in from l.a i knew my friend was sunday night right  before valentine's day and i knew my friend was selling a ring uh from because his um engagement fell  apart so he's so i went to uh i was at a 12-step meeting and i saw him there sunday night before 
[01:30:00]  going to the airport i said you still have the ring because i was planning on getting it anyhow  sure right so he had it so we ran to his house and i went back to my house and got the cash  you know because i keep that kind of money around i headline and uh yeah well 500 a lot of people have  that around so i got the ring and i picked her up to the airport took her to the diner and some you  know some turkey burgers or whatever right then i checked into a best western hotel and i you know  busted out the ring yeah but i already bought her diamond earrings and i wanted to return those i 
[01:30:30]  figured since i got the ring why should i give her both but like an idiot i gave her both that is  really cool though that you didn't go to a store and pick it out you just got it from a friend in a  12-step program was probably relapsing it needs the money to get high that's all right so here let me  have the ring you bought for your fiance that's nice very spiritual we got it appraised man it's  unbelievable really yeah i'm very happy very happy with the appraisal you really are a jew squared  do you know that i'm telling you yes i am bought it from a friend then had it appraised i know you  you murderer we can't get deacon back over here maybe when he finishes a couple drinks we'll work 
[01:31:00]  on him yeah is he knocked out already yeah yeah are you listening yeah but i don't know if it was real  you know it could have been somebody else that looked like him that's true scatman  crothers might have gotten knocked out who know the difference yeah you didn't go there or  lou rawls like yeah he looks like a lot of people you know you don't recognize deacon jones  no i don't do you know that i don't even really know who deacon jones is i've just been playing  along just a big football player from the rams a fearsome foursome i don't watch football i knew his 
[01:31:30]  name because he's a legendary player but i would never have known the face you can't be bothered  with football i don't like football why uh i really only watch fighting i watch like the ufc ultimate  fighting and boxing that's the only thing i watch you know i get bored with sports like to me the only  thing that matters like the score and everything it doesn't mean anything like a ball goes into a  hole that doesn't mean anything that's to me it's like a guy dropping a cell phone but if a guy beats  a guy's ass that's exciting i'll tell you one thing you know i i don't know i i finally found my line  because i i was into the ufc for a little while checking that out oh man what they do when the guy's 
[01:32:00]  just in that when that guy's in that position they're just using their elbow and the guy's nose and face  i'm like i'm done i do i know what i can't watch for the ufc you do a great job by the way i bought one of those  things i didn't even know you did it until i heard it you really like what an animal man you know  everything about it it was really interesting to watch thanks man i've done martial arts since  i was a little kid that's what i used to do before i was a comedian i used to teach taekwondo i taught  at uh boston university i used to have my own school and uh i used to kickbox but you took other stuff  i mean taekwondo was i did jiu-jitsu now yeah i've been doing jiu-jitsu you ever do ultimate fighting  though no i just well i don't want to fighting is something that first of all even if you win you're 
[01:32:30]  still going to hospital you're getting bashed up you're going to get hurt your face getting smashed and you  have to be completely totally totally committed to doing that and i don't i don't want to hurt  anybody i don't want to do it i just like watching it now frank shamrock would you be nervous about  fighting him yeah hell yeah he's a phenomenal didn't you say one of those celebrities were  kind of like bull uh one of the karate celebrities were kind of like a fraud yeah but these are guys  who fight none of these guys are frauds these are all the guys that fight in the in the octagon 
[01:33:00]  they fight in the ufc we're getting an update from club soda canny now i just spotted macaulay  coke and i'm trying to catch his attention so we can talk to him about michael jackson talk to him about  anything where is fascinating it's over there with a stupid green hat on yeah that would be  fascinating so i'm keeping my eye on him does he still look like he did when he was young i don't  know i just saw the back of his head probably what michael saw also thanks kenny captain obvious  is to go the real deal oh who knows probably not even if he was the the martial art that he does is 
[01:33:30]  aikido and it's there's a lot before the ultimate fighting championship came around there was a lot of  confusion as to what was really effective like people who did karate they thought their style was the  most effective people who did judo thought their style everybody thought what they were practicing  was the most effective but really it's little pieces and percentages of all of them mixed together  and that's what it is now it's mixed martial arts and when the ultimate fighting championship came  along they said look let's find out what's better let's put everybody in a cage and you know you you  have a grand prize and the the best guy wins it and we found out a lot of stuff that people have been 
[01:34:00]  practicing for thousands of years was almost totally fucking useless in a real fight situation that's what  fighting is that's what martial arts supposed to be about it's supposed to be martial it's supposed  to be about war about combat with your body and there's a huge percentage of it that's just  completely fucking useless and they didn't figure that out so you know what is seagal good at aikido  yeah is aikido good as a martial art no no it's a transference of energy martial art it's like a guy  commits to you and you throw him on the ground i mean basically the idea was aikido was invented so  that if a guy has a sword and he loses his sword in combat he can defend himself against another guy with a 
[01:34:30]  sword where the guy commits to you you use his energy against him but that doesn't work against  guy knows how to fight to fucking strangle you you know use man i just got to get a hold of you all  guys do is get a hold of you grab a hold of you control your body and choke you unconscious aikido  is good i think if kelly lebrock comes at you too hard you want to smash your head into a wall  or smash your cock into her mouth we had tito on the show tito ortiz oh yeah and uh you know i  yeah get steve over here oh that's when he choked that guy out yeah yeah that's right 
[01:35:00]  you still listen to our show a lot well you know what i heard about it from the ufc i couldn't  listen because i was living in la okay i heard about it steve yeah we're you know joe does the  ufc and all that and tito choked you yeah like in like 12 seconds i was a bad motherfucker but i  bow to steve that he even took him on yeah i was i mean you were grappling with him for real i was a  good 140 pounds heavier too 140 pounds heavier steve agrees to let tito go at it with him and it was  right before a big fight right yeah he was in town promoting the fight and uh tito's like yeah 
[01:35:30]  and we're like tito seriously uh you know steve's a bouncer and stuff he sort of can handle himself  go for it just don't you know just don't you know kill him right right and uh it was freaking scary  how fast he got you he's he's a brutally strong dude that guy is very strong and he's uh you know  professional fighter you know that guy trains five hours a day he's legendary for his conditioning  within like 10 seconds he was on my back and had me in a sleeper hold and you could feel just the air  leaving and before i went unconscious i just tapped and that was it tough motherfucker really 
[01:36:00]  and you know what he's not even the best how crazy is that he was guys his ass randy couture just beat  him chuck liddell just knocked him out in the first round or second round excuse me isn't it but i mean  it's amazing it's amazing it's still being banned in some places no no it's just got passed in california  and it's a it's legal in nevada nevada state athletic commission legal in jersey legal in a bunch of  places but i've been doing it uh i've been doing the commentary or doing interviewing the fighters  since like 96 we used to have to go to like dothan alabama and weird fucking places because  that was the only place that would allow us to uh to do the shows but it's it's it's now it's  there's a tv show on spike tv called the ultimate fighter and that thing's getting fucking huge 
[01:36:30]  ratings yeah it's like two million people a week are watching it's which for spike is  fucking phenomenal and so uh the pay-per-view numbers are growing it's a growing sport but once  you go see it it's the most fucking exciting thing you'll ever see because it's really it's human  nature broken down to the basic element two men trying to dominate each other you know when you  watch when a guy slam dunks a ball in his face a guy's face you know oh what he's trying to say  is i just beat your ass and then but the guy at least can walk away and go yeah man this is a  fight i'll kick your fucking ass see that's what fighting is in a fight there is no like you can't 
[01:37:00]  get your ass kicked and go yeah well i could fucking slam dunk a basketball on you because nobody cares  you just got your ass kicked it's definitive ending of all uh male combat of all male competition  do boxers enter it do boxers they do but they get tackled get taken back yeah you have to know  how to grapple you have to i mean boxing is very important a lot of guys who are who are fighting  in the ufc are actually pro boxers and they do really well because they know other things like  there's a guy named chris lytle who's one of the top guys at 170 and he's a professional boxer as well 
[01:37:30]  he does both but it's uh it's a fucking crazy sport man but it's so much fun to watch it's so much fun  i watched a few and then i couldn't handle it anymore oh i just could not handle it have a couple of  beers yeah i know i shouldn't be such a wimp enjoy it it's exciting i was pretty much able to watch  anything but that was finally when i said look it's safer than boxing done boxers are much much  more dangerous they take much more shots and they don't have as many options when you're boxing if  you get hit you're not even allowed to clinch you're not even allowed to hang on you get penalized  for that you can get disqualified for that but with a with the ufc that's what it's all about it's 
[01:38:00]  like using the best tool for the best situation if you get hit with a punch try to take the guy down  if the guy's dominating you on the ground get to your feet you know it's all it's a strategy  it's it's chess with your body you know who's the best guy in the world right now you think there's  no best guy there's a bunch of really good guys most of the really good guys uh you know like tito  is a really good guy randy couture there's a guy named vanderlei silva is probably one of the best  pound for pound guys he's from brazil there's a guy named bj penn is a guy from hawaii who's a bad 
[01:38:30]  motherfucker he's phenomenal there's a bunch of bad really really tough guys and there's not that much  money in it i mean the top guys make like a couple hundred thousand dollars for a really big fight  i mean for boxing that's yeah you can't get roy jones to piss in a cup for two hundred thousand  dollars you know and you're going to get these guys to train for six weeks weigh in take drug tests you  know all that shit i mean it's it's the sacrifice they put their body through i mean tito that  motherfucker goes to big bear and he's up there for six weeks just running in the mountains at 10 000  elevation pulling people on bicycles behind him you know and wrestling for hours and hours at a time 
[01:39:00]  and punching and kickboxing they're just animals they're fucking but you know what dude when when  they're there when they're competing it's the most exciting thing in the world when two of the best  guys at fighting when you see two guys that are fighting for like the ufc heavyweight title or the  ufc middleweight title those are the toughest motherfuckers in the world period there's no one  better than them at that level see i'd rather see to see how tough they are because they're both so  good it's fairly even i'd rather see one of them just beating up a scrub then you get that then you get 
[01:39:30]  the real difference like some regular civilian just getting his teeth well that's what the old  ufc's were that's what ufc one ufc two there was a lot of guys who are fucking uh karate masters a  lot of guys who took a lot of bullshit martial arts and those guys thought they knew what they were  doing they got in there with like hoist gracie they just got strangled like a little bitch like  instantly like toyed with uh we got to break in here club soda county no i just wanted to say did  anybody notice how ripped joe rogan is yeah he's the word i saw his photo layout i almost quit comedy and 
[01:40:00]  just left the fucking it was embarrassing yeah no he's a serious dude too martial artist and  everything he's washboard abs yeah it's depressing yeah it doesn't make any sense you're not supposed  to do that if you're a comedian it's it's really a violation of all comedy rules it's really stupid  it's stupid in my part to fucking uh pose for this after i did i'm like oh this is really not  a good well joe is an odd combination he's actually a comedian that has self-esteem and gets laid it's  a very odd thing to watch and a good comic but when you say like that's the one thing i learned  hanging out with you guys yeah low self-esteem and just yeah banging hookers whenever you can 
[01:40:30]  hey boss you still writing for the oscars or yeah yeah dude i've been watching chris rock do that  shit at the comedy store how funny funny funny funny shit if he does that set at the oscars it's  gonna fucking destroy it's so funny it's so you know i mean it's the funniest give me one of his lines  man oh he's doing all no no no no no never just never no no no never give me a little taste joe  no no no tune in sunday sunday sunday yeah but you know what give us give us one of the jokes that  you know he just won't use because there's no way that you know all his materials gonna 
[01:41:00]  no i can't i don't i don't want to do that you know it's just really funny shit on alexander  about how he was four gay marriages until he saw alexander  dude he's he's it's it's fucking just i and i'm not even doing it justice because i don't remember  exactly i mean it's a long bit but it's fucking phenomenal he's got some really funny really funny  shit everything it's about time they got somebody with balls to host the event oh yeah this billy  crystal shit yeah who wants to song and dance i always like those i'll see nathan late on broadway 
[01:41:30]  but sometimes though you got to give him credit he'll put himself in like the movie and you'll  be like oh that's billy in the movie and it's really it's always funny i'll tell you what steve  martin was funny when he did it he did some edgy he's great oh yeah yeah it was good uh they need  someone who's going to do stand-up that's how i look at you there's a weird thing that happens  with comics i mean steve martin at one point in time was probably one of the funniest guys ever  but like then you know a lot of them just kind of like drift off into like a bad spot club center  county eric paladino he's a doctor on the or he was he was on anthony's table he just got knocked 
[01:42:00]  out oh wait anthony beat him sorta cameron manna oh that show's canceled couldn't get her off ace jack  couldn't get her off ace jack were you the dude that was playing with the shades on drinking the beer  with the ipod yeah that was me were you listening to um i was listening to it which point i was probably  listening to foo fighters oh okay no right at the beginning you were cranking something out of  your ipod oh no i was listening to um oh fuck oh shit you're allowed to it's satellite radio oh  fuck this shit motherfucker let him fly man let him fly so yeah uh the guy i do the radio show with 
[01:42:30]  it was uh to your right there he's still he's hanging in with the black hat oh yeah he's a he's a prick  he's just you are a prick uh he just gave anthony the finger uh anthony's uh i hear his strategy he's  just folding a lot at that table right yeah he's not really doing much i was playing tight up until  i ran into the cameron manhunt wow cameron manhunt can play poker she took you down huh i don't know  that's debatable i think the pros got she got lucky well no she had ace jack top pair but there was a 
[01:43:00]  straight out there one card off the straight the problem is yeah you can't you can't bluff out of  the celebrity so are you like a serious player i just won my first tournament monday night at hustler  wow oh wow the hustler so this so you know who that master guy is you know who that guy is that's  pretty he's a famous guy he's pretty good i took out phil helmuth last night at the tournament is he  a big guy yeah really we don't know anything about cards we're just sitting here just goofing off  just hanging out yeah we don't know it 25 grand isn't that kind of a lot to go that quick 25 what 
[01:43:30]  would he bet in five ten grand yeah was it you're 25 grand i i i know it's 10 grand you start out  oh 10 grand you start out with yeah 10 000 um uh yeah and then um i i was up to like 12 and  unfortunately i i played a little too uh too aggressive too aggressive so you've played in  tournaments before i've never played in a tournament but you can't play aggressive  a lot of people in the beginning and he was saying that a lot of times aggression in a certain  situation yeah it's just something that like it works this way if i played 
[01:44:00]  that way right um if i played again if that if i played the hand against a pro they would have  folded but all right because it was uh but the camera has a jack i'm sticking with so you played  too good that's what i think i like the way you put it yes i will say you played the right way and  she played the wrong way she got lucky i don't think she's gonna win do you think that the uh but i'm  bitter right now and i'm angry so i wouldn't trust anything i say do you think that the camera and the  lights just contribute to what's like the whole thing i think if you're looking at uh it as far 
[01:44:30]  as lights go yes awesome that people should have won season one who's character doesn't have yeah i  i think b arthur has a better chance uh this year big star here right he doesn't know that jim's  goofing on but not not at all big big star right to your right rich voss rich voss how you doing  how's it going he was on last comic standing last comic standing one in three i knew that was you  and and uh my friend um um oh my god i'm totally blanking right now i heard dan cut for cutworth and  uh dan produced that show dan produced last comic stand and dan and um second season i 
[01:45:00]  can't believe i'm blanking and jane jane yeah i was only on for i was only on for one thing when  i got in a big argument with uh what the fuck's his name the old dude that died oh uh with hack  it but yeah buddy hackett oh buddy hackett was supporting hacks you got in an argument with  buddy huge huge argument buddy hackett it was a guy was stealing materials this guy calls out  hacks i like rogan man he calls out hacks wait how bad does it suck hold on as a comic oh jim uh  you know you know i'm a fucking huge fan of your act i think you're hysterical how bad is it when you 
[01:45:30]  see guys biting off your shit it's just it's the worst feeling in the world when you spend all that  time constructing a bit writing it out testing it on stage tweaking it and some fucking cockless  douchebag goes and steals it well this guy ant goes on fucking tv and he's in front of this crowd and  he's doing old george carlin shit he's doing shit that's from a movie he did some hack jokes from  the movie boiler room that apparently at one point in time was jim david's bit it was a gay joke it  was uh you know the guy says to him yeah they should put your people around they did it's called  manhattan that's jim david's joke exactly so he did this and i i said look i said ant i said you got 
[01:46:00]  great energy i said uh you know you're you're a very likable guy you're obviously very talented  very funny i go but i've heard all those jokes i've heard a bunch of them yeah so uh  fucking monique is sitting next to me she's going well you made it y'all sugar you made that material  you and i'm like what the fuck are you guys talking about and then buddy i go comedy is  supposed to be your thoughts this way you see and this is what makes you funny and and buddy hack  goes you're a fucking asshole you know that guy i never heard those bits and you fucking did this 
[01:46:30]  and then he died like two weeks later and it was really funny because at that moment while it was  happening while it was happening that moment i was like should i yell at this old cocksucker and then  i'm like you know what no i shouldn't you know what fuck him yeah like let this happen if he's  was a hack or supports hacks that's fine words were fuck him let him die that's what you said  i think that's is that two weeks later but i was like if i yelled at him right there before i went  fuck you who are you yelling at cocksucker if that happened and i pushed it right over the edge  i could have killed him on tv it was an excellent career move that i backed off at that moment that 
[01:47:00]  would have been in your promo tapes they show it the improvs on the road just  June 22nd through 25th i just you know i always love it when old people think it's okay that they act  like like fucking assholes i'm like you were an asshole when you were 20 if you were 20 you were  talking to me like that i'd smack you in the fucking head but because you're 80 like it's okay like  it's like understood that i'm not going to do anything go ahead rich old comics stole from  each other yeah exactly exactly that's how it goes now that's why he's being defensive you know he's 
[01:47:30]  just he's defending himself well this is what hold on hold on back in the day it was acceptable  no no no no no they would take each other's stuff you know uh those guys not all of them though  even back in the day not all of them they're just you know it was just more common because  they didn't have mass media there wasn't television there wasn't radio nobody knew  and see you do it somewhere yeah yeah take it you could just take it you could take a guy's act  i mean there's a lot a lot of guys that was their whole act like you know this is where it's tv  business it's where it makes no sense this is tv business this is the deep inside hollywood  it's thanks dad had a better description of it the motion picture business shut up here's the thing 
[01:48:00]  someone like and who is talentless is hosting a show on vh1 so is he well you know what here's  the thing he's not talentless he's not talentless who he just he's no i don't think he's talentless i  think he's a very good performer he's a very entertaining guy he's got a lot of energy commits  to what he does he just doesn't he's not smart enough to write jokes so he takes other people's  shit and does it and i can't respect that but i do think that he's a talented guy i just think he's  going about it the wrong way and a lot of guys when they start out as open mic night i've seen it 
[01:48:30]  many times guys like bite a little and i remember early in my career i sounded like other guys like  i i tell a joke and i go oh i didn't that sounded like fucking rich jenny or that sounded like and  like uh you know it's part of the process of growing but the guys who make the big mistake to go off the  wrong path is when you start stealing and it's very tempting it's very tempting you're in some  fucking bar in pittsfield new york you know in the middle of nowhere and you know you you know the  fucking crowd is you're like i know some jokes that will get a laugh because right now my  fucking act my miserable act is bomb are you listening to this norton yeah but it's different 
[01:49:00]  if i steal though because i smile after i say wink yeah wink wink you're so lovable so i always credit  like a friend of mine once said and i'll just do the joke and people always enjoy it so you know  like him hosting a show or something like that maybe he'd be good at it maybe that's what he  you know maybe what that's what he's supposed to do but he's not a fucking he's not a  fucking comic all right you know do we have an anthony update anybody you say he's hanging in  in there though a lot of guys are getting kicked out were you surprised you got knocked out so  fast um yeah you really wanted to i i would like to have gotten been there for a while i love to

[02:01:00]  the car crash now when you need it but look at the sweat coming off my forehead but i'm usually  pretty good at this but i'm losing this one do you think that in this day and age that i would condemn  you um uh i mean i've had to deal with people like sean hannity sean's a good friend of ours is he  yeah i don't i don't agree with his politics but he's a good friend of ours why we were on his show a  a few times he's too conservative mr asner what's your opinion oh my god sean yeah yeah oh i think 
[02:01:30]  he's a mannequin what's a mannequin that's a big word for me you don't know what a mannequin i think  he's a mannequin man he's very stiff right oh no he's not but he's too pretty he really is too he  really should be modeling clothes yeah he he doesn't belong on tv this point of view he really doesn't  belong on tv all right only ugly people should be on tv right i think you know sean is very good in  this day and age because he has such a warped political ideology that seems to be going very 
[02:02:00]  well right now big bush quarter yeah so i'm you know you're the biggest dick no i'm not hannity is  like that he's absolutely right hannity is a very very conservative pundit well you you weren't aware of  that anthony no i'm that's not really anthony that's opie he's lying oh what's his name his real  name is opie opie i see anthony's playing cards i can't let this happen the great as an asner hey  thank you thank you can i ask you a question do you do you feel like you're on where is this radio 
[02:02:30]  show heard xm all over the satellite radio all over the country in this casino i have a question have you  ever heard the banana phone no no it's a great song we'll play it going in a break you were on one of  the greatest shows in history one of the greatest comedies to ever be on television do you do you  feel that like what do you think about the comedy today do you think it's watered down on television  what they're passing off as comedy what how do you feel about the comedies that are on now i'm a  fair i i love curb uh curb your enthusiasm yeah that's a great show that's my favorite show i like that a 
[02:03:00]  lot unfortunately i don't watch uh i don't watch that either uh but i unfortunately i don't watch the  others uh what do you like i don't like i like mary tyler moore i like uh  what do you know nothing nothing you look back at the old shows like like sanford and son all in  the family they're so much better they were so much better the sitcoms were so much better but  mary tomore everybody in the show got their own spin-off show everybody from the weatherman gordon  they all had their own show that's how good it was great show all right that that was a great 
[02:03:30]  observation you didn't know that everyone of course i did yeah you didn't you can you can say  on this yeah yeah yeah it's totally uncensored it's phenomenal who do you want to curse out first  uh well let's see did we cover hannity all the way yeah okay uh let's see who's left uh rush limbaugh  oh well yeah um the the herman goering of radio uh um i know i don't i don't have you know curry but 
[02:04:00]  curry just didn't have a shot he didn't he didn't stand up for anything during the uh during the election  well he did tend to self-destruct didn't he i mean i was rooting for him the weirdest thing to me was  how everybody just threw dean down the sewer after that one crazy speech i think it was great you  don't even you don't even know what happened there do you no he doesn't he doesn't know can i show my  knowledge what did you know he was yelling because he couldn't be heard that's all that do you know 
[02:04:30]  do you understand that they gave him a microphone right which the media uses to block out exterior  noise exactly it's called a uh uh a uni-directional whatever oh so the crowd was going crazy and he  was trying to shout so he could be heard to the crowd the microphone cut out the crowd noises so  that he sounded like a lunatic yeah on the microphone why do you think they kept looping it and showing it  on uh because it's republican media no no republican control media absolutely sold him down the river 
[02:05:00]  maybe it was because the clintons wanted hillary uh oh my god they didn't want him to no no listen i  think i think everybody's wrong i think it was the most sensational thing to talk about i mean look  it was fucking ridiculous i don't think there was any conspiracy i think if you if you watch that  tape it's fucking hysterical the guy screaming hey we're gonna go to watch it you're like whoa this  guy wants to be president he's out of his fucking mind at that point it didn't have to run with  that why it yeah you gotta run it happened they had to run with it but yeah that's exactly what happened  the crowd was really into what he was saying it was insane but you didn't get to hear the 
[02:05:30]  he sounded like a maniac from the very beginning the republicans were spreading the story when dean  was doing started out doing well in iowa that they couldn't wait for him to gain the nomination  because they knew they could beat him they spread that story the democrats bought it hook line and sinker  which is why they so fell fell easily into the trap right of going to carry in iowa there you go  and i do think the republican media kind of sold him down after that they showed they kept showing 
[02:06:00]  it because you know you mean like abc cbs they're all very very conservative and they definitely uh you  know dan rather all very conservative and they did attack him and kind of throw him to the wolves  like that you know thank god he became uh he did did win head of the dnc you trying to get rid of  me yes what are you doing making sign language what's the sign language uh ed he's our producer  and he decides when uh a guest is uh getting a little too boring and that was the sign what  the usually gives and more disrespect i can i can tell you anthony that that's the last time

[02:10:30]  guy how old are you 30 years old and you play poker professionally what a fucking cool job and  what celebrity beat you today i didn't lose to a celebrity i don't even know who i lost to some  random dude i'd never seen before really yeah i was like i said just goofing around having fun  wow a pro's out and anthony's still out there playing that's not too shabby that is that's pretty  how much money have you won uh playing poker uh i've won more than anybody else in tournament  poker last year i won last year i won about 4.5 million holy shit oh my holy  shit so holy fucking shit so you won four and a half million dollars playing cards so last year i 
[02:11:00]  did just last year last year he said when he said i'm i was just fooling around out there i'm like  now i believe it he's like dude you're a pro poker player wow how many years you've been doing this i  started playing when i was about 17 18 years old and how long pro how long have you been playing yes  when i was 18 i mean i didn't have a real job i worked as a telemarketer for a day and it was that  wasn't me so holy shit i don't like people tell me what to do so four and a half million  what's what do you think all told you've made um when tournaments i'm the winningest tournament 
[02:11:30]  poker player in the history of poker that's like uh seven or eight million overall i don't know  with cash games and stuff i i figure like 12 million you just weren't in you won millions  dollars in cash games like in crazy hotel rooms and shit with mostly with guns no that's like back  in the old days we've got that ever happen though do you ever have like some crazy basement game with  a bunch of hoodlums you talk to a guy like dole brunson he'll tell you a lot of stories like that  but i've been robbed before a couple times back in the day back in the day in toronto  what happened well i just got robbed by a couple guys in an elevator they were cool though you know 
[02:12:00]  they didn't beat me up or nothing they just took the money so canadian money you're talking about  that was canadian money back then yeah it's crazy after you've done playing poker which do you ever  go to crafts or something for excitement for real excitement not really when i moved to vegas i knew  it was pretty important that i had to like stick to poker that's it wow yeah yeah it goes right to  the bank right yeah cash you just treat it like a career right it is a real job you do you read books  on it and practice i write books i don't read them you write books no i've read a bunch of them but i  don't really think there's a lot of books out there right now that are really going to teach you what 
[02:12:30]  you need to know do you do you practice or do you just play i mean do you like go over strategy like  how do you what i did that when i was learning and stuff and i was and i was getting better but at  this point i don't there's not much left for me to like learn from that kind of stuff so basically  your whole job is just playing cards period when i feel yeah no preparation just play cards what's the  coolest thing you've bought coolest thing i bought yeah because i mean you're like you're  like us we you didn't have money growing up at first right no no and then all of a sudden you  you realize you could play this poker and you're you're doing so well what what was that one i guess 
[02:13:00]  it would be the lexus sc430 convertible which is a fun car it's good for vegas top down paid cash  right i did too they were freaked out i actually brought like eighty thousand in cash and they like  counted out one by one like hundred by hundred like we've never had this before that's new for us  that's a little understated too for a guy that's that rich i would figure you'd be trolling around  in a ferrari or something i like that car it's a fun car have you seen it it's a fun car he's  trying to defend his ride yeah it's a pimp ride yeah he's trying to defend his whip and you were the  toyota poker player of the year i was the espn toyota player of the year a world poker player of the 
[02:13:30]  year card player of the year champion player of the year put a player of the year i was it  norton's a big big fan of uh of poker so i i just get too intimidated and i'm i'm not a good  player here we go a friend of mine wanted to become a pro and do you think that a  guy who wants to i mean look he plays i just kind of enjoy it but do you think that a guy who  wants to become a pro i mean the whole setup out here is just kind of geared towards like you're  just making it kind of like happen and all that stuff like from what are you talking about 
[02:14:00]  thank you oh what in the world is this guy talking about gotcha it's all about making it happen  making what happen let's caught you becoming a pro what i'm saying he gotcha becoming what i'm  saying is to make make it happen being a pro you're a pro and it's a lot different than like  when someone's an amateur playing amateur poker so i'm saying it's the lights and the camera kind  of what makes the whole pro thing i mean people throw that term around like a pro what's the  difference between a pro and an amateur that's what it's kind of silly because when i was 23 years old  and people say well what do you do for a living i said nothing what do i play cards was 
[02:14:30]  well wasn't i a pro i mean i didn't know i was a pro but i guess i was anybody can call themselves a  pro and suck at poker you know if you don't have a job and you're a bum say i'm a pro  pretty much very interesting cool yeah no shit so do you have poker groupies  poker groupies well i was engaged but i'm no longer for the last three days that's a yes  good for you the last three shut up three days ago yeah we wait wait there's a story here there's  a story here there's a story here three days ago he called it quits with the uh nice what happened  well we basically didn't everything was good we got along great except for a couple minor things you 
[02:15:00]  know politics religion and the way to raise our kids so oh yeah just just a couple things  those are a little big who's the religious one well i mean it was just philosophies about  you know our approach and things like that don't get him started with religion  who's uh joe's religion she's a lot more conservative than i was oh yeah a little you  know on certain issues religion yeah she wanted to raise the kids in like some sort of religious  school well i got this thing my my dad when i was 17 years old i'd sit out in the pool when i was 17  we'd have a drink we'd have a glass of wine and she's like but that's illegal i'm like i'm not 
[02:15:30]  letting the government raise my kids i was exactly right and i'm like you're kidding me right so we  don't have alcohol in the house i'm like whose house my house i don't think the house that i'm  paying for was she really hot she was cute now do you think now you broke up with her just think  about other dudes just gorilla her that's what i always think i'm i'm being honest whenever i break  up with a chick the first thing i think of some other guy fucking stuffing her into the corner of a  couch just fucking slamming it coming in her face that's all i ever think about i think about 
[02:16:00]  her liking you must i think shit i just let her go and then that's the worst thing that could ever  happen to you is you break up with a really hot chick and and then during the the the soft period  where it hasn't hardened some other guys there's a book called arousal you should read it explain  what that's all about it's honest it's it's just natural male chimpanzee instincts i'm so enjoying  that come on man you know it doesn't bother you the idea of some other guy fucking the  shit out of her but when you're thinking not really her loving it her worship in some other  guy's cock this is the woman that you love and she's just got her tongue out and she's rubbing on her tongue 
[02:16:30]  and and she's coming in her face and closing her eyes it's dripping off her fake eyelashes that  doesn't bother you one other one of the bothers me and i don't even know you one other thing the  guy's black yeah it bothers me and you're not spanking it to that thought what's wrong with you  all right well daniel thank you it was a pleasure you got it guys dude that's a very interesting job  man congrats for having the balls to pursue it thanks seriously that's cool 4.5 million very  that's awesome man that's fucking awesome did you get the ring back you get the ring the ring back

[02:18:00]  knocked out he made 4.5 million last year playing poker and he's out of this tournament yeah he said  what did he say he said he was just fucking around yeah he was just fucking around today  he was well he wasn't feeling he didn't feel like going through the whole process i think  i was doing the same thing plus he lost his chicken he lost his chick three days ago so he's all broken  up yeah his mind's somewhere else oh wow he should be drinking he's trying to get his ring back what  finally knocked you out i mean what did you what kind of hand did you have i actually had uh two pair  with an ace kicker so i actually was in good shape the guy flopped a five on the river to give him 
[02:18:30]  a straight oh wow so i was in good shape and uh i started learning poker last night at midnight  my buddy was teaching me so we played from midnight to three i had three mccallon rocks  i woke up with a little bit of headache and i dreamed about cards so i thought you know i'm  like all right i'm gonna be good today and then uh we got into this and we're the first out at your  table uh yeah first out of my table but i also at that time i had already amassed yeah the most chips  at the table myself and this other guy had quietly and we had head to head and he listen when we shook 
[02:19:00]  hands he's like all right great we shook hands his hand was soaking wet he was nervous as could be  and he's only these you know pro guys maybe he's just one of those sweaty awful people he could be  that he could but i don't think so he was one of those guys who looked very very serious about  this game some people just perspire a lot though they're just disgusting they transfer the duck  virus and they shake your hand is that what your virus my hands are very dry very dry that's the  new virus you gotta worry about the duck virus yeah it's it's over in asia or something like that  saying that the flies are uh are infected people that's good yes great that's wonderful another 
[02:19:30]  thing to be excited about how long has your show been on which show aren't you playing superman  yeah i did that 10 years ago i don't know dude i don't know out of the are you serious i don't  watch tv i don't worry about it it's all right that's all right see his shirt over there the flaming  ass yeah i have nothing to do with it oh not anymore okay no he's that's that's a while does it  bother you that there's sort of like a curse uh that's attached to all the supermen is that it's  kind of a weird thing though really right but it's like you know everybody was ever you know  president united states except for like six guys they're all dead so i mean yeah but they're old 
[02:20:00]  yeah exactly i know i know i'm not i'm not trying to freak you out no it sounds like it freaks you  out a little bit no it's not like it freaks you out a little d come on come on one guy killed  himself the other guy got paralyzed i mean but there was another guy before the guy before that  kirk allen what happened to him like 96 years old died of old age there you go  but that dean went back in history to make sure okay look there was a  1946 cereals what is this is it maybe that when a new superman comes along that's when the old 
[02:20:30]  one gets all fucked up you know what maybe that's what it is that may be the case because when you  came along yes and now there's a new one that's gonna oh you're the only guy to ever put that  together fuck dude if i was you i'd wear one of those big rubber crash collars i wear walk around  i wear a helmet at home it might be a good move i have to ask this how many chicks banged you just  because of that role they had to want to bang you because of that well um you're gonna have to ask the  chicks that i because i i figured they wanted to you know do that sort of business because you know  uh i was charming and i went to school in new jersey that's what i was kind of hoping 
[02:21:00]  i really didn't do it that gives me hope then if that works because i went to school in new jersey  and i still have to hand over 300 after it come on it was only a little golden shower  yeah jim's into something a little different d 300 for a golden shower yeah it's really awful they  don't do full service dominatius full service yeah so do you feel like playing on because i  never played in a tournament of any kind i get too nervous do you do you feel that playing in like a  setting like this is conducive with like getting knocked out or is it like one of those things 
[02:21:30]  that you just have to kind of like you know go well this is what's going to happen you know whatever  i don't know i mean i've never played before i don't have a concept i have no idea what's going on  here so it would throw me all these people i didn't care i don't i mean i was the guy like i said the  guy was very nervous his hand was all sweaty it was very important to him to be in i was having a  good time and all right like i just picked my mom up from the airport there's my mom over there  she's sitting there my mom hello oh she's reading poker player she's reading poker player she's  working from the airport she doesn't want me to stay very long okay i figured i'd bet early and see 
[02:22:00]  what happens we we plan for charity yes what charity can you say i'm playing playing for the  basically a boys and girls club it's called the malibu foundation for youth and family i grew up in  malibu california so okay so if you get knocked out do they don't get any money or do they still  well i don't have money to them anyway so i don't think that you know what i gotta go ask  people that that's a good question it's kind of depressing you know they're sitting there you  know hungry or whatever yeah well well you know the kids in malibu so underprivileged right that's  what they always say that's a joke but yeah but the reality is you know it's a good place there  a lot of kids out there who need someplace to go after school and it's a great situation all  right well dean thanks thanks so much man i take a break here dean kane 
[02:22:30]  just a minute ladies and gentlemen i think something is happening this is the worst of  opian anthony serious xm first of opian anthony looking back at the year 2005 when we went out  to los angeles for the world poker tournament my name is iraq in this segment here joe rogan is  filling in again for anthony he's out competing on the poker tournament there we get updates on how  he's doing and uh jennifer tilly gets to join us we talked to her for a little while also deacon  jones comes back after having quite a few at the bar he comes back to give a give us a piece of his 
[02:23:00]  mind and uh whatnot joe rogan opian anthony world poker tour 2005 here it is this is the worst of the  opian anthony show serious xm we're back with the opian anthony program broadcasting live from the world  poker tour in los angeles california believe it or not anthony is uh he's hanging in there yes he is  very impressive uh club soda kenny though during the break said that his chips are dwindling 
[02:23:30]  right uh steve what is he down his last few now uh we don't have your mic on can we get his mic on  dan thank you what's going on he's down to his last few chips but he is he is hanging in there he just  but from what i'm hearing a really really really big time pro he's he's hanging in there just fine  except he's dwindling his chips are dwindling and he's at a table with all pros and cameron manheim  and he's looking like he's cameron manheim knows how to play poker huh yeah yeah that's pretty 
[02:24:00]  obvious just hanging in there all right where did ed ed asner go i'm obsessed with ed asner how can you  not be kenny's been looking at the celebrity seeing who's kicked out yeah here comes kenny kenny's uh  been grabbing a lot of guests for us good anthony's pile is dwindling i'm sad to say yeah he's against  pros i mean you know it's yeah he's amazing he's still there he looks like he's having fun though well  he's finally looking very relaxed he just didn't want to be the first guy kicked out today right  right no he's doing a respectable job because in the end no one's going to care as long as he wasn't 
[02:24:30]  the first guy out yeah because he's not gonna he's not going to be at this table tomorrow yeah that's  the table to be at joe right there and i want to thank mr rogan for picking up the slack for the radio  show he's doing a fine job i'll say everyone loves joe rogan joe kicked ass today yes he did he always  does he sure did thank you kenny well we got more people steve what steve that men the master  guy anthony just uh trounced him he folded and anthony's got a big pile of uh chips in front of 
[02:25:00]  him now wow yeah anthony's making a fucking comeback a huge comeback and there's a lot of  action at his table the camera crews are over there right now look kenny's rushing back kenny's rushing  back yes anthony just cashed in he beat men the master he's like back in there is men still in though  yeah yeah but he made him fold made he made the master fold yeah yeah yeah so now he he he's got  chips all right good could you imagine anthony actually does make it to this table that would  rock that would be fantastic well we're talking one of the guys and they say it is possible that you 
[02:25:30]  know every once in a while you get some kind of uh you know long shot that goes a long way i don't  know maybe we're underestimating how good anthony actually is i agree anthony actually is a very smart  guy he's very smart he's incredibly smart and you know he downplays but i think he knows what he's doing  anybody that can do a tony dan's impression you can't underestimate him you know tony dan's is  on us now we we haven't been able to work that line in about two or three months that's too bad  that was one of the funniest fucking things i've ever heard in my life what's up i just got uh 
[02:26:00]  morgan freeman's coming in where is he please are you serious no we're trying to get deacon jones  back he's outside drinking like a maniac on the patio is he really smoking smoking and drinking yeah  we have no more celebs i don't think we have any more where's lavar burton i want to get him just  tell him to come over here jim's got extra memory sticks i know jim after the broadcast you'll get  all your celebrity you don't have you don't have to ask lavar burton you just have to tell him you  know that old role will come back and he'll walk over i said get over here boy no well he was in  the movie that's a long time ago all right well we were hoping to get anthony uh before the end of 
[02:26:30]  the broadcast but he made a huge comeback and i think he's going to be playing for a while how long  do they play until it gets down to the the last table here the the eight spots is that what  happens yeah so anthony could be here for a few more hours easily they're all pointing at somebody  over there yeah but don't they take a break don't they come back tomorrow is an elimination i think  tomorrow is the big you know where they broadcast the finals right there in front of us they got the  cameras and everything set up so so if anthony wins all this money does he have to donate it to a 
[02:27:00]  charity yeah what happens with anthony's money look anthony's uh he's giving us yeah he's uh getting a little  more cocky just gave us a thumbs up from table 14. i knew he would last uh yes quite a while i might  not have been real funny but i had a lot of good questions today terrific what are you talking about  i really didn't like that one he's assessing himself i might not have been funny but i feel  i had some good questions he does this every time he goes on all the message boards one stupid  person will trash him and then he can't sleep do you like talking shit on the internet i love talking

[02:30:00]  aunties before me yeah so what does that mean it's when when uh there's a pot in there there's money in  the pot and you have nothing and you bet like five thousand dollars you bet big hoping everyone  and it was like oh look the girly girl has pocket aces and then they all fold and then you take all  the money in the pot that hasn't happened yet but you get these pros that look right through you and  go you're so full of that's right down my very first hand though i sat down i got quad tens  i slow played it which means i really got hardly any money at all yeah wait a minute i was like i have 
[02:30:30]  a monster hand i better start checking speaking a foreign language wow what are you guys talking poker poker  are you a serious poker player no not really but my boyfriend is so he yells at me like once  i felt it two people and he was like that's the most bonehead play i ever saw in my life so  that's not very supportive well you know he he knows everything he tells he's taught me everything  he knows but i've only absorbed about 20 of it now i'm not a very good poker player yes a friend of 
[02:31:00]  mine plays do you feel that the whole like light and atmosphere and all kind of contributes and makes  things like really like you know the way it kind of comes out makes the lights and atmosphere makes  it kind of the way it comes out like the whole the whole uh the whole like pressure of the cameras and  stuff like that oh you mean it makes people behave in different ways yes i've seen people behave um  more crazy when they get to the final table and then they start doing like talking stuff like  performing for the camera i'm always the same person whether the camera's on or off 
[02:31:30]  but usually the camera's on it takes a lot of people out of their game and my friend used to  play a lot and he said that you'd be amazed how many times people just like you know well a lot of  my friends who are the pros they say when the difficulties is everyone watches it on tv now so now they'll go  like gus hansen i'll go to the casino and they're like oh we know gus he's he likes to steal and so  a lot of times where they would fold and they you know bet bet into him right you know my boyfriend's  he's um he's like the crazy weirdo poker player and he says it's kind of affected his game because 
[02:32:00]  everybody's like oh that that phil he'll do anything and so you know everybody wants to play with him  and he has to kind of live up to that reputation now we play i play on his online account and um  people try to talk to me they're like what happened you were such a good player yesterday now you're really  bad i'm like i'm just gonna keep playing and pretend like i'm not reading that chat jennifer  more importantly uh look at jim norton's arm embarrassing all right yes look at the hair 
[02:32:30]  it's very wispy and there's not much to it i don't have any hair on my arms they always tease me because  i don't have hairy arms i i think it's nice no just touch it though just you know most men have coarse  spirally hair yeah but just touch how wispy it feels embarrassing right there you're not going to get me  to touch his arms wow the first person ever in the history of this gag that actually has some  sense what yeah he just no they just don't embarrass me because they know i'm very self-conscious  hey i'd love to sit in chat for a while but i gotta take a leak okay everybody's business oh yeah

[02:33:30]  it's very distracting uh you know i'm at table with laura prepon or laura prepon she has a show called  hollywood home home hollywood home hold them or something like that and people don't know about  her she's super aggressive and so i'm like trying to like um sabotage her a little bit because every  time she comes in with a big race all the guys fall because they're like you know pretty little  girl like her she couldn't possibly be stealing so i'm like hey yo laura where didn't you make the  final table at that esquire event and she's like it's me on the information what a shock a chick

[02:34:30]  celebrity photo wow all right there you go thanks jennifer look at that nice ass you think it's all  right it's a little it's a little oh sorry nothing what we can't hear you you never have commercials  so you never get any kind of break whatsoever it's just like one long ongoing yeah that's that's it so  then we get to talk about silly stuff okay thank you jennifer bye enjoy the xm when you get it hooked  up all right um are they getting back to the tables now i want to talk you don't really think that's a 
[02:35:00]  nice ass dude no people i was just uh oh no actually her boobs are really nice yeah it's attached to a  gunt we call them bunts west coast wow that's a big one dude oh man does she have a kid  yeah in about a week l.a is fun yeah it's fun see boss you got greedy and you wanted the picture 
[02:35:30]  quick and there was light behind you i was trying to tell you did it not come out of course it came  out these no mine did it come out these guys are so obsessive with their stupid celebrity  where's anthony i want to talk to him before where you have to go off you got it oh boy you look dumb  you just spilled water all over the equipment rich no i didn't yes you did how would i i'm sitting here  you pulled the cord and it knocked the water over who put who put the water on the cord what do you  think the water did kill itself you knocked it over i'm sitting on the mic don't blame me for that  you put your dumb water on you pulled the cord you guys are fighting over water how dare you 
[02:36:00]  yeah well it comes now anthony we want to get anthony back before uh before they uh start up again  anthony uh has a a nice little he's doing great little there we go  got a nice little spring to your step oh that's better i took a leak they're drinking water over  there so how psyched were you that you weren't the first uh oh very excited to get up on the table  out i've taken a couple of pots i'm folding a lot i'm not really taking oh we're getting updates and 
[02:36:30]  you're playing very conservative you know just very conservative whatever i've played i've won  uh so i'm i'm you know being conservative are you up um yeah well you just made a big comeback  because the thing is it's hard to be up when you're being conservative because you got to keep  putting in the blinds and now they're in there's an ante that also has to be put in uh in the blind  bets which go up every so often but as long as i keep winning a few hands and keeping even and not  really uh uh spending the pile paying for blinds i wait for those good hands and then and then hit 
[02:37:00]  them are you feeling comfortable yeah much more than i was when i sat down you start drinking one that  i gotta worry about wow that's crazy camera manheim i know camera manheim is like taking pots  off of phil gordon and shit it's it's ridiculous but that's the game you know you gotta wait for  the good cards she's had some good ones she's got some balls she goes all in you know she she calls  bets that are that are all in bets deacon jones was one of the first people out was he after being  all cocky oh and wait till you listen to the replay of this mess of a radio show we had really 
[02:37:30]  asner on we had asner i was opie attacked asner guess who pissed him off you no who else would  piss him off who else would say that's the signal we get when our guest is being too boring who else  would say that you did not in front of a hollywood legend a legend what did he say  he wanted to kill me he called me the uh the destroyer and when i said i was getting a picture  over there and we sold oak down the river what a creep he is and how we love marital  and i'm getting a picture with him i'm like i just love your work he goes oh you guys are great get rid of 
[02:38:00]  that fucking wasp that's what he said about opening very good listen on the replay it was  yeah you don't have to listen to this show and then you're interviewing people you know it's fun  yeah people coming up with card players and stuff coming over the one guy i i don't know who he was  but he's like one of you over here yeah that dude we we don't know none of us know and was he  cool though he was real cool real cool smart guy the only one who didn't fall for norton's  shit yeah good yeah i'm asking one of my questions like what are you talking about  it was awesome he was a slick character that guy made four and a half million last year 
[02:38:30]  mill man playing yeah friggin poker the problem is we're wrecking norton's gag because we we can't  stop laughing oh here she is here she is you're the killer have you been watching yeah no anthony's  at your table this is my show so i'm playing with you and i'm telling him how you're tearing it up  that's right i am what you should be afraid be very afraid i know i'm still  playing so i'm not going to get any real strategy out of you but is this a lot of skill are you  getting good cards out there here's the deal yeah i have a date tonight so i don't give a 
[02:39:00]  shit oh really that's the only way it's the way to get an audition it's when you want a part you kind  of not care yeah and when you're playing with the pros you gotta not care you're taking hands off of  pros out there like you're like you're one of the pros i i don't know i don't know something's uh  hitting today it's uh it doesn't make any sense to me i have been studying i've been watching the  pros yep i've been watching the uh everybody on uh television tv-oing all the poker channels  and uh reading some books so you're surprised buddy i am a little surprised i'm surprised i'm 
[02:39:30]  doing so well you seem to be a little palsy with phil gordon what's going on there well what happened  was this is uh this is sad and i can't believe i'm repeating it because it is uh very detrimental to  my career but i was playing on the celebrity uh poker showdown and one of my strategies was i wasn't  going to keep looking at my cards because i think it's a sign of weakness that you can't remember  two goddamn cards right yeah so i had a a king and a seven a king of hearts and a seven of something 
[02:40:00]  off suit and you know the flop comes off king of diamonds you know four of diamonds three of  diamonds and i'm thinking oh my god i got this pair of kings and he he and he's betting my  opponent's betting and betting and i'm thinking he's got he's got the flesh and i keep asking him  you got the flesh just tell me if you have the flesh tell me now this is a friendly game just  tell me if you have a flesh and he's uh he's like i don't have a flush i promise and i'm like he's  got straight that's what he has he has a straight and so even though i have these great kings i fold my  hand he shows me his straight and i'm like great great call on my part then i watch it on tv and that 
[02:40:30]  king in the hole was a king of diamonds and i had the king high flush so phil has just been  kicking my ass all day about how i folded a king high flush to a string anthony's gotta go  back we gotta go back i gotta go get all of anthony's money now here we go here we go  we're gonna have to find out how anthony does to uh tomorrow on the program  that's a very good uh it's a quick it's a cliffhanger he's such a sick look at him 
[02:41:00]  that face god damn was that her bo i don't know i didn't smell it oh man that was awful  really absolutely awful i didn't want to say anything because that because anthony would  kill me because they're at the same table i was dying to go for that really i was dying to go for  that that's jim jim jim now they're hold on get get around mike wow wow she loves jim's uh comedy 
[02:41:30]  she loves your comedy jim is that what she was saying no she didn't say both yeah she did like  rich too oh she did like you too that's good the one celebrity that recognized me looks like cass  elliott opie opie said she had bo did she have b anyone else smell the b.o did not notice and i  don't want to do that to anthony because he would kill me because they're at the same table yeah that  would have been an easy target first of all she recognized me she was nice i would never say anything  bad about it but who would smell the b.o who cares she's under a lot of pressure playing black uh poker  poker what did romano say i saw you talking to ray romano ray said uh if you ray go ray said if you 
[02:42:00]  lose do you have to come over here i go yeah he goes well that'll give me more incentive to win  brad garrett we saw walk by yeah we've got a lot of the big stars though who haven't we gotten  besides macaulay culkin ken we done we we did pretty well today i'm trying to get that little creep  but uh what about deacon jones we got to end the show with deacon we only have like four or five  minutes left in the show he's probably doing an episode of cops right now he's that hammered 
[02:42:30]  yeah i i you know he's on the patio is he he's out of his mind all right what were you gonna say  uh no i tried to get brad gabbert uh garrett and ray romano but they wanted to go to the bathroom  instead all right they're getting uh so you couldn't get romano or brad garrett no all right no i'm  trying though maybe we'll eat later have something with parmesan cheese on it all right thanks i am hungry  all right well you and your wrong your wrong word eight cents they're uh while i was ahead on that  one they have begun dealing the cards again fourth time's a charm anthony's back in what are we gonna

[02:49:00]  was reaching for it i was panicking i was dropping it so you can bleed it so you bluffed us man you said  you're gonna whip it out i mean i've seen his i've seen his yeah what your audience look like  i mean i'd like to see what your audience look like it's not a gay show you know what a lot of  fun a lot of fun though where's uh where's jimmy we missed jimmy today well jimmy is on his way to  houston for you know his gigs that uh he's very busy with his gigs that he ended up promoting uh  ad nauseam oh did he dude don't ever leave me again don't ever leave me again i mean it was fun 
[02:49:30]  i had to play some carts you know i mean jimmy you know he's great at what he does we all know  that but as far as trying to concentrate and helping me out you know knowing that you weren't  around because there's a whole chemistry thing you and i do sure there are so many times he just  he would just leave the show to get a celebrity photo now you're you're sitting there doing the  show i'm doing the show you figure uh somebody to bounce off of would be jimmy you're talking and 
[02:50:00]  he just takes his head set off and walks away as soon as there was a celebrity there was one point  where i'm doing the show by myself and i'm asking steve or somebody where's jimmy oh he's over there  because he saw like uh whatever some actor oh my god and he thought that was a perfect opportunity for  him to run off and get a picture taken yeah and i'm like shouldn't that be like your third priority  you know show should be show should be your first but it's not with him he's got he's got three other  priorities before the actual show uh number one is to get laid right and if that means leaving 
[02:50:30]  the show he will do that he'll do it if he gets a call on his cell phone while we're doing our show  even in new york he will get up and leave he won't even he won't even you know tell us where he's  going he'll just leave true we saw that happen in new orleans you know all of a sudden there was a  you know he was negotiating like lap dances during the commercials and stuff and and next thing you know  we're at on that balcony i'm like where's jim oh he's getting a lap dance yeah we're broadcasting that  was the whole reason we flew down to new orleans for mardi gras but he's a sex addict sex addict  so he had to get that out of the way addictions usually get in the way of work and family and 
[02:51:00]  things like that so that's number one and then number two celebrity photos without a doubt which  which yesterday was a complete nightmare because there were so many celebrities around it was  ridiculous foaming at the mouth also like i would turn i'm talking to joe rogan who did a great job  on the show yesterday and then i'm turning to get jim's comment and all i see is like his headset  sitting on the table and he's like he's off and running to get another photo well at least he had rogan  there who i heard was just an animal well yeah he uh he he i'm taking all advantage of satellite 
[02:51:30]  i was gonna say he understands what satellite radio is all about and he wanted to see how far he could  go and then the other thing with uh norton is uh if he has to take a leak he just gets up and goes  yeah yeah he doesn't mid-conversation a couple times no waiting for break yeah mid-conversation i think  he figured there were enough people there that maybe you wouldn't notice he was gone you know there  were enough people with the headsets on and microphones in front of them that he could leave and  maybe no maybe you wouldn't notice it was it was fun uh you know it was definitely fun because it  was a different type of show but uh you know to do that day in and day out forget it and then you 
[02:52:00]  have rich voss who doesn't have headphones on and he's he's starting like his own radio show during  the show there were two shows at once oh yeah and so that at one point i just yelled do you ever  fucking listen i'm just i'm just like a babysitter here because we're getting into some kind of  conversation it was me rogan and one of the celebrities or something and and i you know as  a radio guy i'm like wow this is good this is gonna be a good 10 15 minutes of radio you know  we're heading in a nice direction right and all of a sudden voss is talking to norton about some silly 
[02:52:30]  thing that has nothing to do with what we're talking about and they're and they're not listening to what  i'm and i was like are you kidding me and then they're discussing how they're gonna get the next  photo okay i'll go up to him all right is the camera said yeah the camera said okay make sure you don't cut my  head out i mean while you're having a whole different conversation yeah and then and then  after the photos taken then they have to show each other and i'm like that's great guys but we're  doing a freaking radio show you idiots jackasses hey can we say hi to joe rogan how do we do this  oh eric could do it back in uh new york hey joe yo hey what's up joe what's up guys how you doing 
[02:53:00]  are you coming by today or what yeah i got a flood in my basement if i can get make it out of here within  an hour definitely yeah you got to do a little more radio with us because i mean we got to take  advantage of the fact that we're in la man because you were a lot of fun yesterday did you hear what  happened with daniel after that interview yeah i read it online what a cunt that guy is he was  laughing with us and choking around and then he gets off and oh they were rude and vulgar what a little 
[02:53:30]  fucking bitch i cracked a little joke what a little joke dude you were so graphic and and  honestly i don't care everyone knows that but i'm i'm reading him a little bit i'm like all right  he's going with this this is fun whatever and i just told anthony i don't know if you were uh  listening i i hate people that don't confront us back you know he was going with it like it was all  cool well that's not his style that's not his style he's you know more of the you know no no  conflicts with him he's a nice guy he's known as like a mama's boy kind of guy and and i think he 
[02:54:00]  was put in a position that he didn't know how to deal with it so he figured he'd just laugh his way  through it and then post on his blog how uh he was ripped apart as he sat down with no big deal i  actually told him what i honestly feel like when i break up with the girl the first thing i worry  about is her getting just fucking plowed by some other guy that's like my biggest fear who doesn't  think of that what makes me think of that no who who doesn't think of that i said even though  even though you're done with that person you really just don't want to be visualizing that 
[02:54:30]  yeah that's one of the main reasons why i don't break up with chicks but but joe you were like you  know she's having gorilla sex and it was amazing you were basically like did you bring up the fact  that she might have taken it in the ass oh yeah it was like some i don't think some other guy who  has a probably a bigger dick than you stretching around like jesus joe what's up well you know what  that's what i think of i mean that's what every guy thinks of your worst nightmare is you know you  tell you go you're never going to get better than me baby and then two nights later she's getting  stuffed into a corner of the couch yeah getting plowed and then i uh and then i mentioned to the 
[02:55:00]  guy and picture that this guy's uh black and he just wasn't into it anymore i'm trying to find  with the black angle that's probably what tweaked them yeah i'm trying to find uh what he wrote about  us on his blog but steve playing the race card oh that you go to whack bag man they had a whole  discussion about it so it's it's on there but anyway joe it was so much fun having you yesterday  it was so much fun being there man i i definitely would like to come again and if uh if i get out  of here within the next there there's something i have a flood in my basement if i can get out 
[02:55:30]  of here within the next half hour i'm coming down all right well it's not raining anymore it's not  going to rain anymore out here no the problem is uh my basement is uh under it's like at the bottom  of a hill and all the water from the ground has like seeped in from the months and months of rain  it's really bad it's a mess you guys are insane for living out here man oh it's great besides that  i mean this is a bad year but other than that it never rains and it's awesome yeah and there's a  lot of hot chicks yeah hold on joe because we're trying to find the blog but you you got it okay here 
[02:56:00]  we go so you know he's talking about the tournament yesterday i'll read this word for word for everybody  so daniel daniel writes on his blog on the way out i did the most disturbing interview i've ever uh  the most disturbing interview i've ever done disturbing interview the most disturbing ever  some satellite radio station asked me to do the show so i obliged i sat in the chair and  the radio host had no clue who i was and knew nothing about poker but we openly admitted that  remember joe we're like yeah it was a big deal we're like oh you're some famous all right whatever 
[02:56:30]  man but but then we were impressed when he told us how much he won last year the only guy who knew  who he was was sitting playing poker that was me we're not gonna fake it of course i could care  less you know i understand about the guy uh they asked me a few questions and then went off on a  vulgar exchange that was absolutely appalling i'm a poker player and they wanted to and they wanted to  do his curse about nasty sex and random garbage i found the host to be extremely rude and vulgar  a welfare version of howard stern welfare oh i'm on welfare robin meanwhile we were talking to the 
[02:57:00]  guy we were very complimentary of him and i said look congrats for having the balls to seek that out  as a career that's awesome you know we were saying a lot of good things to him just one thing you know  we were talking about he's talking about he broke up with his fiancee yeah yeah and the ed asner thing  will go down in history as one of the one of the classic ona moments he called you a destroyer 
[02:57:30]  oh yeah that's right why a destroyer because it was weird he was goofing around sort of but not  really it was like a weird thing he was basically uh saying that i don't like people being happy and  yeah i have to just make everyone uncomfortable ed asner's very uh perceptive ed asner's a very  perceptive man at his age to be able to pick that up in no time wow hey joe did you stop by the  the comedy store last night no i didn't i have some shit i had to do they were teasing that you  might be there last night we went there for a little while we saw uh what's his name the guy 
[02:58:00]  that's been on uh johnny carson the most that's there every freaking night every night for 40 years  yeah argus was there anthony yeah argus was one of one of these old timers that used to do uh carson  all the time and i think he's still thinking that he's he's gonna be on leno he dresses up in his  in his uh suit every night and does his hacky jokes it was just awful well he he's there for  the farmers farmers farmers yeah yeah vacation the tourists yeah there were a group of people from 
[02:58:30]  like kansas enjoying uh what he had to say there always is but uh if i can get out of here within  the next half hour i'm definitely coming down all right joe yeah we'd love to see you again  it was awesome it was a blast joe i think uh you know i think we got to talk i think you know  things are going to be happening with our little uh channel here and i think you need to do a little  more radio i would love to do it it sounds awesome let's do it all right joe thanks joe thanks guys  take it easy there is joe rogan everyone heading to pump out his basement yeah so that was daniel he 
[02:59:00]  just did not like us and yeah wow and i like that is the most disturbing interview ever ever that he's  ever done and you know and he was so pissed that we didn't know who he was whatever you know why  it's at a poker thing you're funny he's so pissed that no one knew who he was but you know whatever  if we went to a radio event and no one knew who we were right we'd be a little miffed just a little  miffed but that ain't happening anymore but if i'm saying if it did we got to go to uh jim norton  he's on hold he's calling us from houston texas he had to leave uh bright and early this morning 
[02:59:30]  anthony jimmy you guys hear me yes we could hear you oh jimmy i i can hear almost nothing i really  know how the caller is feeling i can hardly hear anything shut up we hate you i want to  congratulate it was a good interview and i want to congratulate mike wallace on that question as  he was walking away where are you from that was really good yeah kenny's just being uh i i try to  do my best you were fantastic thank you what a tool hey jim yes i heard you uh you met some celebrities 
[03:00:00]  last night yeah um did you did you tell the story i heard you heard the story lazy what's that i heard  you met patrick swayze yeah it was really fantastic and i even say patrick can i get a picture i'm a big  fan i'm not patrick and he walks right by me and that was david keith it was david keith i was so  annoyed because i like david keith a lot i mean i don't like anyone that swallows a ring and then hangs 
[03:00:30]  himself in 1981 and i wish i would love to get a picture with him and i was so pissed off at myself  and stupid yoshi is tackling and of course he didn't know the name jimmy don't you and do you  understand jimmy we were just talking about him like that day who me and you you you brought up the  guy that hung himself in officer and a gentleman the the that same day oh i didn't remember yeah we  were talking about him and i thought you knew his name well i do know his name i just do you know it's  not patrick swayze you idiot well he does look like swayze a little bit in person um yeah and i 
[03:01:00]  wasn't ready to see him and by the way he reacted you could tell he's probably gotten that a lot because  his hair is a little bit longer and he wouldn't even make eye contact you like i'm not patrick and  he just walked by and i even doubted him like come on man yes you are i'm a cop what is wrong with  you i'm a stalker and a retard that is really bad and then uh forrest whitaker yeah we were we were in  the jury's uh i was with uh yosh and joey silvera and a couple of the guys were just hanging is that 
[03:01:30]  the jury is looking over at him and so as they got to check our whole table got out and left and i  had the camera open and i guess he saw us looking at him because joey uh comes running out like an  eight-year-old and he's like dude he's running out the back door so that was right after i had the  problem with uh swayze slash david and i ran around the corner and forest saw us coming and he was  creeped out he started walking faster to the parking lot because he's like a really he seems  like a really private guy yeah like he doesn't seem like the type of guy that likes to be bothered he 
[03:02:00]  wasn't rude but you could tell he's very withdrawn and very shy he's like a real actor man and so i'm  like can i get a shot with him he's like uh like i think he thought i was paparazzi he's that guy at  the end of talk radio and i was just gonna kill him right there in the dark parking lot but he took  the shot he was very nice and that was that oh well two more to add to the uh the uh collection  and one more oh one that's right yeah you guys uh didn't get to do that porno thing last night huh  nah she kind of flaked out i mean porn chicks i mean i'm regard i know the the the reputation they 
[03:02:30]  have of complete mental stability is that very dependable yeah and they're also very dependable  yeah she just could i guess she was busy who knows you know maybe she's settling for the degree i  don't know what she's doing it really sucks i cannot hear you guys it's very frustrating wow yeah  well uh maybe they'll fix that eventually who knows i don't really care anymore uh jimmy trip  uh we're having a good time i mean it's not as exciting as yesterday because they got us in this  really weird room where a bunch of people are being escorted in and they're going to watch poker 
[03:03:00]  on tv while the actual event is uh taking place next door it's the strangest thing so they're all  sitting in chairs looking in our general direction and uh they're all a bunch of zeros of course they  are they're an absolute bunch of zeros and they're just staring at us they don't even know you don't  know these people and they don't even know we're talking about them yes they do oh they do well that  guy does now oh this is a nightmare it really is awful chris ferguson working here the broadcast 
[03:03:30]  yeah they can i don't care no it's not like on speakers or anything but the room isn't loud enough  that where they can still just hear us talking yeah and they hear me oh they can't hear me no no  they can't hear you oh no you would fortunately leave us out to dry i'm sure a lot of people like  yesterday's show jimmy because we were just throwing each other under the bus over and over  and over again i told most of the stories on the air the whole ed asner thing i thought it was going  to be some great radio because you know you're you're like a republican leaning conservative at times and 
[03:04:00]  he's like he's as left as they come and you just all of a sudden just go yeah i agree with everything  you have to say ed i i agree this idiot said that there was a conservative media yeah yeah i know  abc cbs dan rather they're all conservatives they agree with them wholeheartedly even a babbling old  anthony was wrong and i i was uh i was telling anthony that the sweat was pouring off my forehead because i  i had my poker face on uh for you know ed asner but uh i thought he was seeing right through me yeah  it was very uncomfortable he was getting the best of me there for a while hey what i guess i don't 
[03:04:30]  know if it was spoken about the the uh uncomfortable things that were written about us and i thought  we were having fun with that guy i didn't realize it was a problem oh yeah he didn't he wasn't happy  yeah we do we read his blog daniel negrano yeah yeah we read the whole blog and you know whatever i  mean i i just i it's just too bad that he didn't confront us on our program you know yeah it was like  i actually liked the guy i thought it was a cool interview i mean i know rogan was like asking him did you  you ever picture like now your girlfriend being gorilla fucked and you know that's got to be 
[03:05:00]  unpleasant to hear but we all laughed about it you know we were having a good time with the guy  and just got a little bit pissed off yeah so whatever a little hey uh norton yeah i got a whisper  hopefully you could hear this you want to hear kenny get uh everyone very uncomfortable in the room  oh no no all right come on grab the uh wireless mic and talk to that zero with her head turned to  we can't get um it's a room thrown out of here again of zeros okay ready to watch poker on tv who is  who who do you want him to talk to which one you want the woman there oh no oh no anyone whoever

[03:14:30]  in here in the brain you're a teenager still that keeps uh keeps you young right the jack i don't  know i think it sort of you know preserves you like pickles you a little yeah in more ways than 32  yeah got it got it now you're uh i heard from our own steve c that you're writing a lot these days  who who you're writing for um well i'm doing a solo album mostly right now yeah i mean i've written  a few songs for ozzy you know in the past who do you have backing you up ozzy osbourne oh now you 
[03:15:00]  remember him before you went into your um yeah from black sabbath right yeah that's what i remember  back in the day right yeah so you're writing with ozzy i was wrote a little bit of ozzy and now solo  who you got backing you backing you up um dave growl there's two tracks with the reverend horton  heat oh wow two tracks with the dand two tracks with the band from berlin called skew siskin good  friend of mine yeah how was it writing with ozzy oh it was dead easy really he just he would do the 
[03:15:30]  basic track and and go hey everybody wanted the vocals to be and send it to me you know and i sit  back and write the vocals and send them back to him dead simple you know so you weren't in the same  room writing no because that would be you know you want to talk about reality tv that would have been  interesting to watch yeah even more interesting to try and do i suppose yeah ozzy's cool you know  ozzy's smart enough you know he ain't no dummy you know they just make him root that way on tv you know 
[03:16:00]  i agree with you on that it's all in the editing of those shows right you know you can cut anything  into anything and make it seem like anything else you know it's just not he does come across pretty  stupid and he's uh he's accepting the you know the paycheck so it's now it's his per summit on tv now  isn't it you know which is a shame because he's you watch any tv lemmy what do you like you don't  watch any i don't watch no is your life just all about rocking all about music and drinking  i can't imagine women too well that's all part of the whole rock attitude that's true but he didn't 
[03:16:30]  actually mention it so i thought he wants people to know that he's banging women anthony i just can't  you can never picture lemmy bored at home going maybe i'll play some video games or something you know  it's all about just the rocking and the babes and the drinking no it's fun you know yeah well  what what do you do i recommend it i wouldn't doubt it it sounds like a lot of fun what do you do in  your down time when you're not doing the music i chase women mostly okay so on the road you have less 
[03:17:00]  time to chase them so yeah when you're off the road you get to catch them sometimes yeah our on  steve says um he knows a lot about you that uh you're you're into uh you're into black chicks more than  white girls yeah yeah like really what's the difference that makes more appealing to you  they're darker the darker the meat the sweeter the treat is that it yeah you're not exclusive  though you'll go you know there's a hot uh what do we got there god knows what are you giving uh 
[03:17:30]  black women let me steve what are you giving lemmy yoshi just handed me well wait sorry thank you dan  yeah yoshi just handed me two boxes of uh sorry no he doesn't like fat chicks yeah uh big black  black girls get nasty too and fatty girls four and it's all black girl take your fat black girl  porn away they're fat he wants you don't like he wants slender blend ones i like them wiry so that you 
[03:18:00]  fight back there you go but that's your fetish you like the black girls it's not a fetish yeah i  guess it's not a fetish it's just a preference a preference i should say sure likes that but like  i said you'll go with the white girls too though right yeah japanese take anything okay that's it  it's high i just like as long as they're female and they're still coming backstage at the shows and uh  oh yeah you know the groupies have you ever been with a filipino i don't like the word groupies yeah  no yeah really yeah because i was with a filipino girl last night yeah by the end of the night she 
[03:18:30]  wasn't filipino she was full of penis oh that's good jesus is that awful your sense of humor is still  in a coma kenny oh look you you sent you sent lemmy back to doodling we were doing fine we were  having a little conversation yeah i'm doing sharp sharp edging now he was he was coming out of his  shell a little bit and look now he's back doing yeah everything was nice and rounded before and  now they're all sharp edged and jagged yes what have you done psychologists could tell us what that's 
[03:19:00]  all about she had ruined it or a psychiatrist war i actually have a lemmy moment i have a lemmy moment  from back in uh had to be 19 maybe 91 92 oh the dark ages new york city uh i was opening for you i was uh  uh an opening act in uh one of these clubs in in new york city and um i was singing in a band back  then and uh my guitar player and you were drinking maker's mark backstage for a while before the show 
[03:19:30]  uh when we got on stage he couldn't play fucking guitar you had gotten him so drunk you're kidding he  was just a catastrophe stumbling well i mean nobody forced it down this no no of course not he was so  thrilled to be drinking with you that he forgot maybe he can't keep pace with you because you can  really put it away that he was incapable of playing never forget what you're doing you know yeah you  know so it's it's like playing with the pros you know you can't sit there and do shot for shot with 
[03:20:00]  lemmy uh well you can if you learn how to do it right you got to start young i gather put the years in  yeah well he thought he was you know a big man he's doing it and uh well he was still a big man it's  just lying down a lot he was lying down after that yeah it was uh it was very one very memorable  moment there's been a few a few people like that yeah yeah can't quite keep up it's funny  there's an english band called a girl school or girl band right and they are fierce drinkers man i  mean they're they're up there with us you know and it's funny to see that's hot the guys they pull 
[03:20:30]  at shows try and drink them under the seat because guys always this macho man stuff you know i  would you like a drink baby and kim go yeah you know you know and then they probably think they're  gonna get lucky with these girls you know you couldn't get laid if she let him you know yeah  they probably think they're gonna get lucky with them and stuff really flat on his back  drinking uh shot for shot with him i that's that's pretty hot though girl band all drunk deadly  ice cold you know back to doodling lemmy no no i'm waiting for him to make something out of 
[03:21:00]  that and i'm gonna i would hope you'd sign it and maybe we can uh yeah what are you make a couple  of bucks what are you drawing there it's a it's a surprise yeah it looks like an instrument no from  india or a ufo no looks like some kind of um something that he's going to use to impale us are  those teeth it's a very um exotic junction box joining this and this okay i have no idea what that is 
[03:21:30]  yeah why don't we go to the falls that's what they call them doodles it's a doodle all right we  got a lot of fans a lot of a lot of fans you do yeah let's say hi to hindu he's calling all the  way from iowa lemmy iowa oh wait you're gonna have to throw those sort of on or or to the side  of your ear there hindu what do you got for lemmy man yeah lemmy hello hey you got me yeah how you  doing you on there bro yeah i am hey man uh i've been having an argument with this buddy of mine for  just like over 10 years and and uh i saw you on tom snyder on the tomorrow show like in 75 
[03:22:00]  he swears tells me that that uh you never made any appearance in the u.s uh he's arguing with me it was  on the saturday night special or midnight special with wolfman jack and i know you did that show but  we just had this stupid argument for you know for years wanting to know if that was if that was  any true i'm probably trying to settle an old bet that involves tom snyder on our show sir how dare 
[03:22:30]  you and wolfman jack we never did his show live we never were on this show wolfman jack i gotta tell  you uh i guess you're lost yeah he's gone let's go to travis it was but you're better off before you  asked me yeah yeah i don't know why we had to take that phone call let's say hi to travis in nebraska  travis what's going on man we got lemmy hey how much oh and a big fan uh lemmy uh yeah love you  and uh airhead man all right oh yeah all three seconds of it that's right i saw you actually uh

[03:23:30]  you travis you gamble at all lemmy yeah yeah but uh i play slot machines you know oh slot machines  that place is no good to me that's an old woman's thing to do no it isn't not if you're a young guy  you got to play like poker if you're a young guy it's a young guy's thing oh he's making some subtle  sense well yeah i do a lot of that yeah yeah you play the slot machines but no uh no card games no 
[03:24:00]  poker a blackjack or nothing like that you know that you have room for human error in card games  you like the machines yeah you really get into the slot machines because there's uh there's not  many people win at the slots yeah i won nine grand on one pull in vegas once really yeah not bad  that's not bad i'd like to see you do it well i'll give it a shot i guess steve saying he goes to  vegas a lot steve seems to know a lot about lemmy you go to vegas a lot there uh lemmy not a lot you  know every now and again yeah that once every six months you play there at all you ever play in 
[03:24:30]  vegas yeah we've played there isn't that odd that like vegas is a play you wouldn't think years ago  that vegas would be a place that motorhead would uh play why i don't know vegas is always like the  lounge act kind of place years ago it had that uh that the whole thing about it yeah paul anchor we  first played there in 81 with elsie osborne you know and the aladdin really yeah and it wasn't  odd there weren't people in the audience going oh i thought i was going to see barry manilow  no they were in the barry manilow um part of the show again he's making some subtle sense here 
[03:25:00]  well yeah you know i mean obviously there's people are at the show because they want to see you you  know i mean the billboard's outside nobody walks in there by mistake like absolutely i i understand  absolutely did you think uh did you think motorhead would be uh around still when you first got together  you think uh here we are 2005 that you'd still be rocking i give it three years if we were lucky  you know really yeah and then it just uh kept going yeah well if you don't give up they have  to let you keep going you know i suppose well that's true you got a pretty loyal fan base of life not 
[03:25:30]  dying right  and the jack and cokes seem to help i might have to join you with uh one of those let me  we could sit here and just drink and doodle let's say uh hi to don in uh new jersey he wants to say  hi to lemmy don what's going on buddy hey don on the phone hey fine how are you good let me first  time i saw you was like 1980 you warmed up for ozzy on the blizzard of oz tour 81 yeah 81 you idiot 
[03:26:00]  i just got tickets for you and coc at in sayerville at the starland ballroom next month i can't wait  good good for you i hope it's a good show it's the first show it'll probably be a bit ropey  yeah i love coc man they rule yeah i can't wait to see you though they're one of the few bones  who've been around as long as we have coc is still out there doing it yeah wow man they were  yeah hey let me yeah oh my god you have to do it 
[03:26:30]  he really was like hey mickey son of a bitch hung up on yeah let's go to mudflap uh the trucker mudflap  what's going on buddy he's laughing  mudflap yeah he's listening to his radio hey man yeah turn down your radio you're on with lemmy  hey lemmy um yeah this is mudflap hey i i just want to tell you about that song uh that you have eat  the rich because like me and my friend were talking a little while ago and uh we were talking about that 
[03:27:00]  song and he's saying like yeah could you believe they're still around i'm like um you know he's trying  norton's gag and he's doing it poorly don't try norton's gag there's like four or five people that  want to try norton's how many how many dates you do a year uh lemmy how many what how many uh gigs  you're playing a year i don't know about seven months of the year usually seven months of the year  that's a pretty rough schedule man you know when you think you know you're not a kid anymore but uh  even though you act like one although neither are you i know i i'm gonna say that but that's why i'm not 
[03:27:30]  out seven months a year you know yeah i couldn't do this this is driving me crazy you do this every  day you know it drives me crazy man gotta get out of this strap on the mic and just you know plow  through the one more time yeah plaster a smile on your face and you don't have to smile on the radio  you know didn't anybody tell you that that's true anthony was anthony was in the tournament  yesterday lemmy yeah yeah i was playing in the poker tournament that's why we're out here and he  he did pretty well oh so that's where the macho card game thing came from is it macho card game 
[03:28:00]  poker players yeah don't like them sissy slot machines well you know poker's taken over the  world uh i don't see you'd be surprised how little it's taken over the world actually it's taken over  america probably but it's stupid america right lemmy no it's stupid america poker in in other  countries yeah yeah but they're not like uh they don't have tv shows about the slot machines yet  not yet believe me i bet it's celebrity slot machine tour that would be fun someone out there  will figure it out there's a show on uh tonight on fox matter of fact tv's just getting out of 
[03:28:30]  well out of control hello but it's getting ridiculous i should say they're doing a show  on fox tonight it's called celebrities without makeup without makeup yeah they're showing people  they must be stuck for a show exactly that's what i was thinking i thought it was a goof i was uh  slow news day i was getting ready to come down here to do the you know the radio show and they  they had commercials for this thing i swear to god i thought i was watching a rerun of like  saturday night live or something and it was a commercial and it was a goof commercial i know  and then realized no it's it's real they're just going to show pictures of celebrities tonight 
[03:29:00]  without their makeup well the more dumb it is you know the more real it's going to be you know  you can bank bank on that we uh we americans love stupid television lemmy apparently we don't like  you know the clever stuff like benny hill stuff like that benny hill yeah the smart stuff  i know do you guys just laugh at americans every so often you're on stage and you just look out  and go these stupid i don't laugh at benny hill i'll tell you that i stopped laughing at him when  i was 12. and even then i was forcing it off the time yeah you know i never liked benny hill much 
[03:29:30]  i like monty python yeah now that was very funny but you had to put a laugh track on it before america  got it we are so stupid over here in this country it's just different it's not yeah we have to be shown  when to laugh with the english humor because we don't really understand that sometimes we're  laughing and we probably shouldn't be and other times we're not laughing and we should be well  you know take your pick benny hill used to like to dress up in women's clothing yeah i know very  good kenny and he wasn't very cute either no not at all he must be the worst transvestite you've seen 
[03:30:00]  in your life right you guys uh they're not caught up with the sex thing overseas there yeah you show the  boobs and stuff on regular tv right yeah yeah over here it's uh on page three of the most popular  national newspaper yeah if that happened here forget about it people lose their minds in the new york  times oh yeah the whole janet jackson thing you guys must have laughed at us so yeah absolutely  silly i mean that that boob is on tv for so what an eighth of a second who cares yeah i mean and you 
[03:30:30]  guys over there you got uh boobs on tv all the time you think it was like treason or spying or  something right why is america it's religion is it the religion you think a lot of people uh  have this guilt thing about sex and the body because of religion it's not like we're exclusive  to religion though they're pretty religious over there in england too no they're not no  i thought they were what what where am i getting my information from somebody religious i i would i would 
[03:31:00]  think i was under the impression there were religious people all around the globe well i didn't think it  was just in the united states but why are we so uptight about uh about things like sex when  well they're more rabidly fanatic in america you know i mean you get i mean i'll give you an example  we were on tour with wendio williams a few years back right and outside the gig in california  in southern california advanced southern california right we got mohicans for jesus outside all with  mohican haircuts and wearing a cross on the front of the devil is in this ballroom you know i mean so 
[03:31:30]  i mean at this point i just you know put up your hands and say good night how do you argue that  that's too ridiculous to even talk about you couldn't even discuss shit with him look at  him that is yeah how are you going to sit down and have a rational conversation i mean you know  you look at them you crack up laughing anyway before you and and they're trying to sell you god you  know like oh yeah good wow you ever you ever have to take any uh guff from any of these religious  groups thinking you know you're satan and spreading the music of no we don't get a lot of that no no you 
[03:32:00]  know well we think we sing about murder and war and sexes which is mostly okay except for the sex  bit but they don't really and they haven't really zeroed in on us yet isn't that odd that the killing  and stuff is perfectly acceptable for some reason sex doesn't know how much blood you got all over  the yeah like every night on tv you can tune in the news and see piles of dead bodies but for some  reason if their young child walks in the room and you see half a breast they lose their minds yeah and  that's you know a beautiful thing it's really weird yeah i don't get it i think we should just 
[03:32:30]  sit back drink more jack and cokes rock to some motorhead and get your tits out basically get your  tits out damn it i love your philosophy why not you know we should take a little break we're  hanging take a breather lemmy needs another drink no lemmy i'm still on the first one states but doing  pretty well you can get me another one if you like all right we'll get you another like that i might join  lemmy as a matter of fact yeah mix me up a jack and coke i'm gonna have my first on-air drinks  since uh we've been on xm and uh we'll be hanging with lemmy from motorhead and uh i'm gonna be like 
[03:33:00]  my guitarist and drink with lemmy and pass out while i'm supposed to be working all right and they are  beginning the final round of the world poker tour yes they are you can just feel the excitement in  in this room you just he's laughing dude lemmy's with me i can't believe you televised a card  this whole thing is a joke right lemmy no listen i i guess thanks i wonder about televised golf you  know never mind poker hey hey hey chill out with the golf i like watching the see silly days good 
[03:33:30]  look silly now people are a little ball into a hole with a piece of iron and wood and then you walk  after it i mean i say if you get it in the hole first time take it in your pocket and go to the clubhouse  you've already mission accomplished why do it another uh 17 times but golf is very relaxing  on a sunday to watch you have it in the background drinking some coffee just go for a walk in the  country i guess you're right about that's true why but you don't have to keep walking that stupid  ball and it's not all manicured watching people play poker on tv stupid it's you know what it is it's 
[03:34:00]  almost like a game show environment on tv you're watching it you're you're rooting for somebody and  then you see their cards you see what they have you're seeing if they're bluffing each other i i  find it uh uh compelling to watch you do yeah i do he's getting kind of into it he's embarrassing  everybody he's getting his pictures taken with these guys the card players that are very excited  he just likes to meet rich people i would yeah be nice you know you meet some of these people i see  them on television they're they're celebrities too not in the same light as lemmy from motorhead but they 
[03:34:30]  play cards you know and they're famous in their own play cards can they play bass that's the thing  isn't it probably not they probably can't probably a few of them can you know not like you statistically  probably a few of them must be able to but you never know who do you find uh good bass players that  are out there these days oh the best one ever was john entwistle yeah god rest him god rest john  entwistle well i mean or whoever rest him you know i mean he wasn't that keen on god either thank you  no swizzle stick so what do you want a swizzle stick before you're gonna swizzle i want to swizzle 
[03:35:00]  a little before i drink don't swizzle in front of lemmy don't swizzle in front of the huge radio  audience i just don't swizzle that's good a knife is good wow steve your swizzle sticks that's a  swizzle knife who made who made this it certainly looks a little pale why is my drink lighter than  lemmy's my drink is lighter than lemmy don't swizzle in front of lemmy let me take it no i'll take this one  ah oh that's good no that's good very good yeah that was yeah wow they're just giving you oh wow 
[03:35:30]  well now they just gave you a ton that's this is like poker i've just been raised by lemmy they put  a bigger glass in front of him i'm sitting here with the small i got the short stack with your  little swizzle and a little straw got a little swizzle though and look lemmy's got let me is dual  swizzling in that glass right there and lemmy's just like the bigger one i have to drink yours no you  don't have to all right lemmy why don't you just use the huge glass you got in the front of your  pants that i don't have a glass in the front whoa lemmy you gotta certainly look like a it's a bottle 
[03:36:00]  it's a bottle you keep a spare bottle of jacket long neck goes down better lemmy the guys were  discussing that you might have a huge hog might do is are you uh one of those occasionally i do yeah  when the stimulation is sufficient you know well we had deacon jones on the show yesterday he's uh  an nfl great you remember deacon jones back in the day i'm not a football nfl all right i'm sorry  but he was bragging that he had a 15 16 incher and not that hooligan football that they play over  there in europe sucker the thing is did he show you we do we said he goes i'll whip it out like 
[03:36:30]  well go ahead then man and he didn't and it's not it's not because it's a it's a gay thing it's  like more of a freak show you got to check out a 50 you got to check out a 15 16 incher right you're  not going to want to see it in any sexual manner but you got to see it as like looking at nessie or  something yeah yeah nessie it's like it's like a sideshow thing i'll pay my 50 cents the same effect really  right it sort of pokes its head up and it's back in it eats grass you know all right people take  photos of it throw peanuts at it you know excuse me lemmy hey jumbo all right lemmy yeah you know 
[03:37:00]  what has a hundred teeth and holds back a monster yeah your zipper yeah yeah that one very much  correct that's that's as old as i am i've been in a coma yeah i know all right well i don't know  about lemmy's uh any of the uh mythology that goes behind lemmy but are you known for a huge  schlong in the rupee community or anything like i know what are what are the rock stars that have  known Hendrix had one yeah you used to hang with Hendrix right i used to work for him you used to work 
[03:37:30]  for him what'd you do i used to just lift equipment and shift a roadie place to place yeah a roadie for  Hendrix you must have seen some stuff then right oh yeah back in the day well it was a lot more fun  then yeah it's a lot of business now right cheaper drugs no aids you know lots of fun that's true  unlimited whoopee basically if you could get away from the ods it was pretty much safe uh safe role  there wasn't many people oded i mean Hendrix didn't od choked on his own vomit which is very very  different i think you'll agree i don't know is it really different or did he choke because he was 
[03:38:00]  in the fact that death is the outcome no it's not the bottom i'm talking bottom line  the chemical kills you you know true okay didn't do that then it was an accident shouldn't have  happened but all that uh banging without rubbers and not worrying about it well there's nothing to  worry about it gotta be great except pregnant you know yeah oh and then they come back years later  we used to use a rhythm method apparently i couldn't keep a beat because i have two kids you know 
[03:38:30]  very good lemmy all right we're gonna hang with lemmy and just uh get drunk because uh  there's nothing else to do here well you're not drinking nothing that's a good one i got  i'm gonna throw something in my coffee maybe i don't know yeah a little little splash in there  something something well a sugar lung person we're hanging with uh lemmy from um motorhead  obviously yes we're at the commerce casino in los angeles it's the opian anthony program  words of opian anthony my name is eric we're continuing as we're actually we're wrapping up 
[03:39:00]  the 2005 world poker tour uh that opian anthony went to it was in los angeles  and uh that we're sitting here with lemmy from motorhead talking to him having a good time and  making fun of all the uh the zeros that came in to watch a poker tournament and all the zeros that  were still in the poker tournament and at least lemmy is there so that's kind of cool here it is  you're listening to the worst of the opian anthony show on serious a serious episode and we're  hanging with lemmy from motorhead live from los angeles at the commerce uh casino that of course is 
[03:39:30]  the game triple h's uh walk on music i think he's still walking on to that right yeah yeah triple h  is triple h is a friend of the show by the way lemmy sorry triple h is a friend of the show he's a friend  of mine too yeah he uh he's he used to do our show a lot and um we'd bring girls in right and uh he was  able to spank the girls there was oh he likes i believe he loves to spank girls and there was this  girl uh peaches that he really worked over it was great her ass was like as red as these uh chairs 
[03:40:00]  you like that do you but uh well it was cool to watch yeah definitely yeah it wasn't bad at all  and then uh then he goes off and gets married to stephanie who we know pretty well too and now he's  not allowed to do the spanking when he comes kick your ass well you know stephanie's probably doing it  all now yeah getting that big meaty hand of his on the ass what did you do uh did you go to the  grammys did you accept your award or yeah you got up but they didn't televise our bit with with the 
[03:40:30]  the hoi polloi you know with the poor people like peasants well because it's rock and roll  they don't like that they're trying to kill it again you know they put all this crap up there  lemmy wins a goddamn grammy you can't get up there and uh you know except they were probably scared of  what you might say too you know i said thank you very much you've got a lucky face well there you go  that's that's not suitably perplexing suitably perplexing it's not like you're cursed or anything  because god forbid you know you hear any language on television yes you know that's uh they'll be 
[03:41:00]  fining you millions of dollars i don't believe god forbid cursing did he i can't find it  in the book you know something now that i think about it that doesn't make much sense god forbid  yeah yeah god didn't forbid yeah you didn't thank god or anything when you accepted your award  that's funny the porno awards avian awards you get this chick got nominated for a gangbang with seven  guys and she's i'd like to thank god and my parents yeah yeah and i'm and dad they never pan  over to the proud dads i know sitting in the audience it's just like the oscar song you know  he's funny as shit yeah i'd like to thank my father for touching me when i was a kid and

[03:42:00]  rockers or or those or they another group where you're like yeah well they must be boring you know  some of them have really gone like soft like you are still kicking ass and playing you know the same  roots of music that you that when you started right uh but some of these guys like i saw years ago i was  such a huge blue oyster cult fan and i went to go see them guys why is he laughing years ago back in  the you know mid late 70s stuff like that i love those guys saw him in concerts so many times you 
[03:42:30]  know and just blasting out you know rocking really cool uh i saw him recently you know within a few  years at some small venue and it was like they were doing muzak versions of their songs you know  everything's turned way down the medley of our greatest hits yeah medley of greatest hits it's all low  volume you know people are sitting there and the crowd chicken in the basket and that yeah pretty  much you know going out to get some refreshments to bring back to their seat and you know i understand  these are old guys and stuff but it's you know you don't have to let it get you down right you're 
[03:43:00]  still out there on stage rocking you know really fast the saddest uh story i got i saw robbie krieger  by himself in a small club on long island i think it's called christopher's or something remember  that joint yeah it was maybe maybe could uh fill a hundred people at the at the club okay people  were playing pool and they had a hockey game on while robbie krieger was in the corner playing  and and the and people are screaming and yelling when you know the islanders see that shows bad  manners isn't it yeah well and and they had the volume up on the tv a little bit and every time 
[03:43:30]  the islanders scored the place is cheering and there's robbie krieger you know a legend to many  yeah in the corner just kind of eating it man well see he shouldn't have ate it you know he  should have just walked off right there was some it was very sad i remember doing some gigs though  where we'd be out playing and you get done with the song and you hear the crowd really cheering and  you feel good and you look and they were watching something on tv it's like oh this man some places  just got no fucking class at all you know it's just no no point going there yeah might as well just

[03:47:30]  wow this is really some this is really subtle but the one i wanted to bring up with him is  the shakespeare of porn a lot of mystery you're not sure what you're getting it was clown porn was  clown porn clown porn was basically these guys these young guys that figured out that they could make  porn more interesting by dressing the girls up in clown suits it wasn't anything too graphic or  vulgar but they dressed them up in clown suits and then at the end of every scene they would bash 
[03:48:00]  these girls in the face with cream pies wow that is the dumbest that's that's almost as dumb as  televised poker i'm with you lemmy come on now there's something to be said for this i'd rather  watch paint dry yeah right listen to somebody kick your shins i don't know i dig it these guys walk  these guys are starting to walk around like rock stars you sit and watch that do you at home at home  absolutely i sit and watch i i know i know the names i know you make it you get three guys around 
[03:48:30]  and play yourself and play poker at least you could win some money that way you know what it's almost  like people that sit and watch uh baseball you know you could get out and get a game together with  your friends it's not quite the same you're watching a crowd of millions you know and all that you know  but it's not going to be as compelling playing the game because you're not as good and you don't got  that much money and you don't have that much money very good but you know to watch the professionals  and the the best of the best sit there and play poker against each other and especially game like  no limit hold'em where it's a lot more strategy than just the luck of the draw what's the big 
[03:49:00]  attraction a good bluff right where they sit there and look at the other guys  and the other guys look back at them and maybe they fool them and maybe they don't if you're watching  a guy and you see that he really doesn't have a good hand and the other guy's got a pretty good  hand and the through the betting the guy with the lousier hand makes the guy with the  yeah another that's compelling it's compelling his eyes stay still right they stay still it does  it no sweating he's not smiling he's keeping what they call that poker face that old stone face it's  kind of compelling that's compelling television if you like mr lemmy what do you like to do for fun 
[03:49:30]  oh i like to chase girls i like to catch girls that's what is better he's all about getting laid  kenny he he already said that it's drinking that long left you know i gotta make the most of it  you got plenty of years left drinking kicking ass on stage oh you've been talking to god  and chasing broads you're not you're not scared to die you've probably seen a lot of your compadres 
[03:50:00]  die right yeah well the hard life living you know do you use condoms no joey ramon died of lymphoma  yeah i have nothing to do with it you know sorry to use condoms do you have safe sex yeah i'm gonna  pull one over my head and go rob a fucking bank  makes more sense you know he uses them just not for that right sure you figure you know even if you 
[03:50:30]  got aids now it takes what 20 years well five tops you know i mean i'm 59 now what have i got to  to forget by that time you know who cares right they got the super aids though now i think you go  for broke yeah there's a there were stories in the paper about super so even superman is inside  it's kryptonite and two things now that lex luther could hit him with kryptonite or  screw him in the ass well he always wore his underpants outside his clothes i thought it was  kind of strange you know it's a little weird there yeah and that cloak you know that cape thing you know 
[03:51:00]  what is it with superheroes and cakes that you know you try wearing one of the streets so far  you get you know down to monica maybe he's trying to get into a fight right superman was here yesterday  where are you going tonight i'm gonna make a finocchio whoops i like my cape you know  i'm kind of dangerous man you know um well i was gonna ask him about movies but  you probably have you seen a movie lately i asked because the oscars are you know just like 
[03:51:30]  no yeah a little different part of lemmy i know about the rock and the broads and stuff and the  and the booze but you know what what you like movies you like uh sure you know what what have  you seen lately that you uh you enjoy maybe lemmy's movie i just re-watched scarface again that's a  great one that's so funny you know that's such a great character it's such a bad spanish accent you  know oh i don't i don't think that movie holds up you know it's a little dated i don't think it's  supposed to be really true life no i know but i mean some of these movies like you could see the godfather and 
[03:52:00]  it's and it's and goodfellas and goodfellas all those movies they they hold up but i'm telling  you something about scarface yeah but the the violence it looks really fake the blood looks  fake it looks dated it looks like it's very dated you know what i mean i just saw when i enjoyed it  first time so i'm enjoying it again you know why not i like casino casino and goodfellas two of the  best movies joe pesky and casino is one of the meanest motherfuckers i've seen in my life and he  really gets it in the end i bet he's a really nice guy too in real life so we here i just saw raging bull 
[03:52:30]  and that movie holds up that holds for the most part you know some of the some of the jacks look  fake but in the fighting the trouble he went to de niro put on all that weight and then drop it again  i'm i'm so annoyed with uh him these days man his movie choices just blow it's like classic some of  these classic movies that if you if you're rattling around the channels and one of these come on you  don't care if it's halfway through you're watching the rest of it yeah the movies he's coming out with  now the guy isn't even thinking he's just like cashing a check and it pisses me off possibly because i  love uh i love she's tired of working hard yeah god knows he's done enough for us i guess i would 
[03:53:00]  rather you know remember de niro for the for the good movies and some of the crap he's putting out  well don't watch the new ones i guess you know maybe i'll do that that's all you can do i just  won't watch that's all you can do that's all you can do that's all i can do that's all you can do  it's all we can do did you watch uh i'm like such a fag i'm drinking out of my little straw let me  you know i'm trying to be cool and hang out with lemmy and i'm drinking you're swizzling even though  you're right i'm a swizzling faggot let me throw that he's pounding what a rotten swiss you're 
[03:53:30]  you're you're you're drinking from a straw i'm taking small little sips with my pinky out i know  did you see any new movies like from the past year like passion of the christ or any of those  no it wouldn't be a bad idea to see somebody kick the shit out of jesus for an hour and a half  it's never been done has it you know i i went with my dad it's never been done though no you always see  the crucifixion seems that's the first thing you see right he never gets all that torture because  they did torture him he's he's pretty much in good shape when they put him up there i thought he was 
[03:54:00]  very well adjusted for an only child you know i like his religious views yeah i don't have a very  religious guy are you there listen i don't believe that you could follow that it's a thin story you  know i mean a virgin gets pregnant by a ghost and then she goes home and says i'm still a virgin  darling but i'm pregnant and he goes for it you know you think i see it deserves to live in a  stable you know you figure she was just making up a story to cover up right i really have no idea i 
[03:54:30]  didn't know the lady but it seems kind of strange to me you know yeah yeah passion of the christ  i don't know did you see it i saw i saw it with my dad and he cried through the whole thing and i'm  sitting there thinking this is the biggest piece of crap i've ever seen uh-huh so really there's the  generation gap for you obviously yeah because he's a lot more religious than well he was a lot  more religious than i was well he passed oh so now he's found out fine well hopefully he's finding  out right now yeah but i hope it wasn't a disappointment yeah yeah i'm wondering i would 
[03:55:00]  love to know but uh i don't know it was just a movie of uh just someone getting beat up the whole i  mean i know so i mean what does that tell you about mel gibson yeah how many ways can we think of to  torture this poor long-haired bastard he likes action movies before we stick a crown of thorns  on him and nail into a piece of wood no it's very nice i i get it for all the family it was like i  get it he was abused really bad before they threw him up on the cross but he wanted to show it all  we get it we understand thank you oh kenny gibson was great in that one he wasn't in it his yes he 
[03:55:30]  was was he oh yeah was he the guy with the nails yeah his fist was in it he was the one he was  the one that uh how can you tell you'd have a tattoo or something i don't know no i've rest  watch this is a rolex this is how boring my life is i read a whole article on it it was his hand  that uh you know hit the last spike or whatever wow see i knew it would be the nail scene i knew it  do you mind crushing the eggs breeze when i got one nail left you know all right we got to wrap up 
[03:56:00]  the lemmy uh interview all righty because uh you got to go they're saying have we lemmy who said that  oh once again oh we have to go no oh so go you just want to get rid of me because i'm not  religious no i don't want to get ready you offended his religion now he's trying to kick you out of  here not at all these zealots no i gotta note that no these religious fantastic what steve uh it was  his fault lemmy oh him yeah what what was the problem dan what dan i know we're boring but no this

[04:03:30]  that brought over this pornography tell me you know there ain't no rules right yeah if you want to  capture every audience which is what tv is trying to do so hard all the time i don't know why there's  more bestiality on tv since there's all those bastards keep getting caught screwing cows and  things again the religion i think there you go you see i think they frown on uh having because cows  are not protestants you see that's what it is cows are mostly catholic i never knew that you never  spoke to one i've never spoken to a cow you've had conversations with cows yeah you've heard of 
[04:04:00]  irish better haven't you uh no catholic you know what what is this i have no idea what lemmy's  talking about wait lemmy what was that one roman catholic cows roman catholic cows yeah most of  them are catholic i have no idea you didn't know that no cows every day you certainly do thank you  for enlightening us with that one lemmy let's say calvinist you know is lemmy drunk no okay please

[04:05:00]  show fishing on tv they do too yeah so that i wouldn't watch pictures of the latest flying  shit you know that i wouldn't watch i've seen the the fishing competitions you know as you're flipping  around the channels and they're out there in the boat and boats going yeah that's a really good you  know and then they show catch one they say oh that's a big one yeah but we throw it back anyway  because we're not cruel right right or no sometimes they take it they put it in the boat then they got to  drive back to some area where they weigh them and whoever got the most fish uh wins and it's like 
[04:05:30]  a big thing they can big trophy big prize money yeah not that i watch it don't get me wrong well  that watch the poker i don't watch that i could see shark fishing now that would be exciting it's a  little more exciting yeah because you get the chance of the bastard will come on board and know your  arm off you know that's that's right there's a little more uh yeah the fish has a little more of  a shot at it you got a fresh drink that was just handed to you there it's only a fresh half a drink  because i had half a drink left i'm sorry okay how about a show where they play poker while they're  fishing while they're yes you know in between catching the fish getting a tug yeah they could 
[04:06:00]  be playing cards thinking you got two audiences there yeah and possibly also doing porn at the  same time oh no you could sneak in maybe as they're playing they're watching you know uh tug and rob  various people on their knees in the boat you know they're watching that sperm uh yeah and playing cards  and the rod over their shoulder yeah there you go one rod in front three and one yeah sure rod rod  i want to ask uh i want to ask lemmy about aliens oh aliens aliens what do you think are they amongst 
[04:06:30]  us i think you know most of them shouldn't have left mexico really no not illegals  peter jennings is doing a show on ufos tonight big uh tv show i'll tell you if you like i mean  ufos i'm gonna get a lot of flack for this i've seen the ufo in 1966 you saw three other people  right there's no mistake you really didn't it wasn't a reflection off the clouds and it wasn't  a flock of bloody seagulls going on for the night it wasn't any of that it was a ufo they came across 
[04:07:00]  the horizon like a bad idol and stopped dead and nothing we had then does that nothing we got now  does that did you just see light or was it a so it was a pink light and it stopped dead and then it  pulsed for about 10 minutes we all got out the car and watched it and then it went wham over the  horizon to the right and where was this what state i was in england england 1966 the state of england  where is that the state of england that's in new hampshire isn't it wow so that's uh yeah so i never 
[04:07:30]  had to worry about it anymore you know whether there was or there wasn't because i saw one and i know i  saw one and i don't care what anybody else's opinion is four of us saw it independent you know i gotta  ask the obvious question were you guys like high or drunk before i even drank that was wow so you  were an infant at the time of the sighting no but i wasn't uh i wasn't drinking or taking dope you  know nothing when did you start drinking 1968 i saw ufo it freaked me out i started drinking two years 
[04:08:00]  later two years i would have started drinking that night i'd wait two years after seeing the ufo that's  pretty cool it's great well peter jennings is doing a whole special on you uh i mean it's kind  of arrogant to think that we're the only place that supports life out of all the millions of worlds  right that's true but it's kind of defeatist to think that you know we're the only ones that can't  get off the planet and kind of visit the other ones you know well we might not be it's just that  the ones that can don't want us to yeah kind of creepy if you think about it though they're able to  come over here and visit us well wouldn't you we're just ants waiting for the you know nuclear 
[04:08:30]  war which is what we'd take to them if we could get off well yeah but they might laugh at our  nukes like yeah i've no doubt those earthlings and their nukes those nukes you know how quaint  yeah they're they're antiquity they're just much more remember when we were doing that yeah dude  aliens are living among stuff are they cats cats yeah i used to call them spies yes i knew it i knew i  wasn't the only one there's something going on with cats cats are like spies they just lie there and watch 
[04:09:00]  you you know yeah i think can you never get thank you from them don't ever lick your  fucking hand or jump up at you do they don't they do nothing but crap all day you know an  interesting uh story i was reading um and they go meow what kind of noise is that anyway it's got  to be code it's a cat noise yeah yeah you hear in 1960 i believe it was uh yeah in the late 60s  uh ufo actually uh flew back to base and one of the aliens got out and saw said holy  shit i saw lemmy from motorhead no did you have a cat with him guys you'll never guess who i saw 
[04:09:30]  tonight we were in england we saw four guys get out of this vehicle yeah one of them was  lemmy from motorhead i swear to you no i wasn't then i was learning from the rockin vicars then  rockin vicars the reverend black in the rockin vicars is that the name of your band it was the name of  that band i joined it oh you joined what kind of music were you guys playing back then rock and roll you  know bill ailey songs no kidding like cover cover tunes yeah it was like a name uh rocking your 
[04:10:00]  moon in the boogie woogie flu we used to do that huey piano smith was it wow what made you go from  that to this well this is an extension of that yeah so-called heavy metal is the logical extension  of the original rock and roll you know what else is right yeah it's kind of an evolution then yeah  if there was a if eddie cochran was 16 now he'd be in a garage playing with the heavy metal band you  know right on the japanese copy guitar you know no doubt yeah what are some of the bands you like  today i don't know i mean i always the mind goes blank whenever you ask me that you know well it's 
[04:10:30]  like that that's that basic you know what i mean the thing closes down know it when you hear it though  you know i've seen a few bands around that are really good but they never get on tv or the radio  you know anymore because the radio in this country unfortunately seems to be controlled by five guys  right that's why satellite radio is taking off that's right i hope so people have had it they're fed up  yeah because it's always like there's so many advertisements on it for a start  yeah it's like cripples the commercials too yeah commercial adverts yes i know we're uh 
[04:11:00]  we're pretty of a commercial nature advertisements and commercials both of them too many yeah  yeah we're pretty sick of uh sick of regular radio and stuff and this you can pretty much talk as  freely as you want yeah you could curse i don't think you've cursed yet whatever language you want  what'd you say motherfucker that would qualify that's pretty good that quality that's one of  my favorite ones on the scale that's one of my faves that's in the top five yeah there's not much  you could say after that well there is oh there is well at the sea there's the biggie that's the 
[04:11:30]  atom bomb we like to call that the atom bomb we got that word on tv once though let me really yeah  that's progress it's pretty common is that any religious picture common in england though they use  a lot well they don't use motherfucker because that's the american one and you know stupid  america yeah don't wanna no i didn't say that did i you said that you get a complex about this we're  pretty stupid over here he likes america i agree with you i like america i live here 14 years now  would you get did you move here because of taxes i think they're pretty bad over there because i like 
[04:12:00]  america you like america yeah really even with all its bad side there's still a great good side to it  i made some of the best friends i ever had here i just would i find i would find that weird to like  live in another country like that like to go because i heard an english i haven't tried it yet  i haven't tried it but i would feel very out of place how long have you been an american uh are you  an american citizen or no how long have you lived here in america 14 and a half years 14 and a half  years like that's a long he's an american you know that's like of course you got your english rules but 
[04:12:30]  i i heard an english gentleman doing uh the traffic report on the radio for new york and it's  like wow that's got to be weird you know he knows all the roads and everything i don't know  he lives there yeah because he lives but i would think it would i i kind of think like going over to  england and trying to foreign like know all the highways yeah get him out of the helicopter he  doesn't know yeah he doesn't know the long island expressway in new york get him out of here  jesus i know that i went to dinner with d snyder you know jesus yeah yeah dealers out there  yeah that's a rough road to travel on though no you know it wasn't that hard i took the bus
