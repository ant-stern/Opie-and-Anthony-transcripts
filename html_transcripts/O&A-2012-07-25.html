<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of a bizarre D. Schneider commercial for Extended Stay America, using his song "We're Not Gonna Take It" to advertise hotel coffee machine placement.  The hosts mocked the commercial's acting and the absurdity of the song's context. This transitioned into a broader conversation about musicians and commercial endorsements, including another D. Schneider ad for Stanley Steamer, and the evolving concept of "selling out" in the music industry.

A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to critiquing Michael Moore's commentary on gun control, particularly his appearances on Piers Morgan.  Opie and Anthony dissected Moore's arguments, specifically his use of personal anecdotes and his stances on the Trayvon Martin case and police response, expressing disagreement with certain claims about the interaction between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin.

The conversation then shifted to the Olympics, with humorous speculation (later proven false) about modified beach volleyball uniforms to accommodate Muslim athletes.  This was followed by a graphic recounting of eyewitness accounts from the Aurora shooting, expressing frustration with the lack of legislative change following mass shootings and debating potential solutions and stricter penalties for gun crimes. The death of a four-year-old in a Bronx gang-related shooting was also briefly mentioned.

The show then covered Brett Favre’s potential NFL return, the Penn State sanctions (compared by some to 9/11), Mayor Bloomberg's stance on sugary drinks, and concluded with a musical interlude. An upcoming Chicago show and a contest encouraging listeners to bring their strangest possessions were promoted.  Numerous tweets and online comments were referenced throughout the broadcast.

Early in the broadcast, banter about interns Rob and Sal, focusing on a prank where Rob threw garbage at Sal, took place. Sal's anger and the varying opinions on whether the prank was “badass” or disrespectful were discussed, along with Sal’s completion of his internship.  The upcoming Chicago show was further discussed,  leading to a tangent about Chicago's crime rate and the song "Leroy Brown," then a discussion about collecting vintage Mego action figures, including one host’s admission of using a figure to hit his son.

The show also featured sexually charged comments about photos of Russian track star Daria Kleshina.  News headlines about increased gun sales after a massacre and a violent scene cut from a movie were briefly discussed, criticizing Hollywood's perceived hypocrisy and knee-jerk reactions.  This segued into a discussion of the upcoming Batman movie and overreactions to potentially violent content.  Further discussion included a *Jeffersons* clip featuring interracial dialogue, the Jackson family drama surrounding Michael Jackson's death and Paris Jackson, and a segment on prehistoric life.

A Chippa TV video of "doo-doo on a stick," a viral video of a dancing hurdler, and a Mike Tyson-themed song were also featured.  The hosts aired their opinions on sponsors pulling ads from Penn State, mocking a Penn State fan's comparison of the sanctions to 9/11. The show concluded with complaints about technical issues with their app.

A significant segment focused on the Penn State child sex abuse scandal, with graphic and offensive jokes about Jerry Sandusky's alleged actions and the university's response.  A Penn State graduate called in to express displeasure, but the hosts continued their offensive commentary, dismissing his concerns.  Further calls from Penn State alumni followed, debating the NCAA sanctions and the appropriateness of the penalties.  The segment also included discussion of the Jackson family conflicts and a purported video of Janet Jackson slapping Paris Jackson, along with listener complaints about the Sirius XM app and a prank video involving a truck and a sleeping woman.  A brief reminiscence about a past segment, "Wow Day," which featured nude women, was also included.

A "Guess the Sound" game, with a sound eventually revealed to be a weightlifter fainting, filled another segment.  The hosts and crew offered vulgar and sexually explicit guesses.  A substantial portion covered YouTuber Jenna Marbles, her videos, her physique, and speculation about her motivations and the role of her attractiveness in her popularity. The possibility of her appearing on the show was discussed, interspersed with crude humor and sexual innuendo. The segment ended with mentions of upcoming live shows and further riffing on Jenna Marbles' videos.  Sam was mentioned as being part of the in-studio crew.

[00:09:00]  uh  i want i want to let everyone know that was not written down  no  that's pretty damn impressive  i just like doing that part  anyone can sing pearl jack  so you watched the michael moore  uh i did not watch the michael moore  i watched the michael moore  i was so  you know what  i was actually having a 
[00:09:30]  nice evening  so i figured  i'd  not fuck it up  even i  at some point  say  have to turn it off  i'm gonna fucking hang out in my  goddamn pool  i like the michael moore  he fights back a little bit  at least the uh  he's  he's pushing a little bit  i like michael moore too  he's a bit on the crazy side  but at least he's pushing  i don't mind people pushing  to start some debate  yeah  yeah  i  but  the one scene from bullying for  for columbine 
[00:10:00]  which you can't really deny  is when they go over the gun stats  for the rest of the world  and it is just crazy  yeah  the rest of the world  has way less than  a hundred murders a year  by uh  guns  and then  america  when the film was made  was eleven  thousand  and change  it's  it's also  that just shows you  something is weird  in this country  yeah  they  they do  they do kind of  that doesn't mean i'm against guns  by the way  all i'm saying is just  something is weird  with this country  i don't  and i don't know what it is 
[00:10:30]  most people don't know what it is  why  why do we have so much more gun violence  than the rest of the world  i think the  plus sides  of our culture  everything that makes our culture good  also has  that you don't get something  for nothing  effect  yeah  so for all the good that happens  because of our free culture  and our free society  and how we  came up as a country  and we're still relatively young country  uh  i think the  the bad part of that  is this  kind of  violent  tendencies  um  that americans 
[00:11:00]  seem to have  but they  they showed so many countries  i'm like man  i think i want to  move there tomorrow  with my family  the odds of not getting shot  are really good  well  yeah  i mean really good  i mean germany's always cited  in that uh  little stat  they're under a hundred  and then you  you only have to go back  a few years  to realize  you know  they weren't really saintly either  of course not  i mean germany was responsible  for quite a few deaths  in the world  of course  uh  back in the uh  30s and 40s  and obviously every country  has their problems 
[00:11:30]  yeah  yeah  and uh  you know  there's a lot of illegal  um  gun deaths  yes  i agree  you know  want to hear michael moore  we got a couple uh  clips  a little taste  please  a little taste  he was on piers morgan  last night  this gun issue  is uh  is huge  in everyone's minds  except for mitt romney  and barack obama  yeah  that tells you  everything you need to know  about our political system  they're gonna keep their  yaps shut  until after the election  that's so pathetic 
[00:12:00]  yeah  they don't  take a stand  they don't want to take a stand  but take a stand  whether you're for it  or against it  i need to know  now  but they're keeping quiet  and it drives me nuts  don't people know  where obama stands  isn't he way bigger  bigger on gun control  of course  but he's not gonna say anything  because he doesn't want to  lose votes  yeah  and romney's not gonna say anything  because he doesn't want to lose votes  they both suck  for not talking  you know  speaking up about this  yeah  here's michael moore 
[00:12:30]  on piers morgan  when he brought his own children  into it  when he said  you know  my two daughters  go to the movies  uh  okay  set up  because i did watch the whole hour  this is uh  this is obama  basically  you know  obama likes to kind of  put his daughters and stuff  into tragedies now  yeah  yeah  yeah  apparently  or like  if i  if i had a son  it would have  you know  he would have looked like  trayvon martin  we remember that one  yes  so now he's using the  well my daughters go to movies  yeah  i think we all do 
[00:13:00]  you don't have to really  personalize it  but okay  i wish i was obama's son  because you know  i think when his daughters  go to movies  it's a lot different  than when you and i  go to movies  of course  believe me  are you kidding me  if obama's daughters  were at the movies  let's not make believe  they're like  hey daddy  can i have 20 bucks  i'm gonna go see  the dark knight tonight  yeah the guy would have  been lit up with an mp5  to his face  how about they shut down  the entire town  so the kids could go see  the latest movie  they wouldn't let him  park there  he wouldn't have allowed  to park his car  right  i think there'd be 
[00:13:30]  people at the door  so i like how he's  personalizing it  but the fact remains  they do things  very differently  than you and i  yeah very differently  but that's what's  happening here  michael moore is  going with the comment  that uh obama said  you know my daughters  go to movies  when he brought his  own children into it  when he said you know  my two daughters  go to the movies  what if it were them  well i guess if president  obama is watching right  now and i and i say  this with all due  respect what if it were 
[00:14:00]  them what if it were  them last thursday night  would you stand at the  microphone the next day  and say i feel your pain  and you know we just we  the existing gun laws  that's what he said the  existing laws are enough  is that really what you'd  say mr president  i don't think so  and and you and i  and everybody  we have to see these  children these young  people were killed on  on thursday night  friday morning  we have to see them as 
[00:14:30]  our children  we as americans  and this is really where  the the larger  collective problem has  to be fixed  we have to see that  we're part of each  other and we have to  take care of each  other the reason why  they have universal  health care in canada  and britain these other  places because they  believe if one suffers  everybody suffers  that is not our  mentality our mentality  is i got mine you  get yours and to hell  with everybody else  nice oh i at least  that wasn't in that  theater you know i mean  that is can't that we  have to stop this  it's i i do i like 
[00:15:00]  michael more even even  when i don't agree with  him i don't i don't  he's hard for me not to  like i i don't like him  i just don't like him  but he was on the show  and we didn't really  challenge him at all  no no he was it really  wasn't challenged him at  all when he was in here  but that was a few  years ago he's really  especially with this  uh with uh twitter um  he's really putting his  opinions out there a lot  more and i absolutely  think he's entitled to  his opinions i got no  problem with that well 
[00:15:30]  let's tweet him i never  blocked him or anything  uh i i read what he  writes um but i really  think he's this uh just  obviously he's a liberal  but he's this fucking  like holier than now  um and i think he's  delusional about what  what goes on in this  country well why don't  we why don't we get him  on the phone let's tweet  him and see if he'll do  a quick phone or today  but then again he told  peers he's done with  this shit yeah he  basically said i'm done  with this shit meaning i'm 
[00:16:00]  not going to talk about  this anymore because  nothing changes good man  he's frustrated by the  whole thing yeah it you  know that's what we've  had some high profile um  you know um gun violence  go down in the last what  10 20 years and nothing  changes is basically what  he's saying so he's done  talking about it because  he knows nothing will  change anytime soon  which is true by the way  nothing will change  nothing will change  people will babble  babble babble i was  watching all the news  stations last night i  watched a shitload and  they're already fading  away from the aurora 
[00:16:30]  shooting yeah they're  moving on to other  things i mean it's time  for the olympics people  olympics the olympics  that's gonna be way more  important than uh gun  violence in america  within a day hey is  this true about the  olympics that um the  um you know they got  that beach volleyball  which is the only really  cool thing to watch  because the chicks are  in little fucking skimpy  stuff i can't wait  are they gonna i heard  this i don't know if  it's true cover up a  little more than they  usually do to appease  the muslims that's what  i heard why i hope so  and england is always 
[00:17:00]  appeasing the fucking  muslims so they're  changing their their  volleyball uniforms they  might not be in such  skimpy attire but i  don't reason to watch  i don't know i'm not  saying but um true is  it true that would be  a shock if if somebody  actually went out of  their way to a p oh  that's right could you  could you uh could you  could you uh yes i am  stammering because i'm  getting excited could you  uh google image  volleyball uniforms 
[00:17:30]  please this is saying  uh london's chilly  summer could mean long  sleeves oh stop it  that's the excuse they're  using playing volleyball i  don't think they worry  about fucking uh hell no  being chilly right you  ever see these chicks  fucking diving around and  stuff oh yeah i do  fucking fuck fucking  hard i love when they  have to pull their  wedgies out in between  points yeah look there  you go oh man look at  that thank you sam that's  a good one muslims would 
[00:18:00]  like that though probably no  the muslims probably  wouldn't like that  fucking amazing ass do  they just get mad at  that they just get so  angry why do they get  angry at that so they're  like ah they can't have  it why they can't have  it so why would that  bother you they can't  have something they  don't want anybody else  right to see it or  enjoy it and if they  don't look at it they  don't want to deal with  their own frustration  like hey i like that i  every guy looks at that  and wants it blow it up  blow it up they just  hate it wow way 
[00:18:30]  wow wow wow so we're  not gonna see that  huh uh no maybe not  nothing's gonna be  bouncing around  oh you see the  brazilian teams fucking  come on it's crazy  brazil the brazils it's  like really you're gonna  put brazilians in that  they're known for those  aces oh god look at  that one oh my god  just doesn't that look  smackable of course  right there that cheek  why do they spell it  with an s by the way 
[00:19:00]  brazil brazil well we  say brazil what is it  brazil we're wrong yeah  i say we're right we're  in america it's brazil let's  make them start with the  z oh look at them  hugging and pat each other  side fannies yay good  hit that's hot man we  better we should start  hugging each other after  a good show i don't  disagree in those  outfits in those outfits in  volleyball outfits so  michael moore uh demands a  change and michael moore  talks about the trayvon  martin shooting as well 
[00:19:30]  oh i wonder what his  take is yeah we have to  stop this attitude toward  each other we have to  realize that those were  our children who are who  were killed there this  past weekend and and and  if you treat it like that  man i think if everybody  honestly really felt that  way we would have some  change in this country  and these politicians would  respond quickly uh if  people would just rise up  and say damn it this is  not the america i'm going  to live in this is too  great of a country to  let this happen again i'm  not going to let this  happen again and i am not 
[00:20:00]  going to come on another  damn tv show either after  the next one of these  shootings pierce because i  haven't done it for 10  years i i is to be nice to  you and you're a good guy  and you made a good case to  me to come on but but that  i'm i'm sick of this i  refuse it i refuse to live  in a country like this as i  said and before i'm not  leaving so therefore what am  i going to do it's got to  change and i refuse to live  in a country as i do and i  believe it's the majority  help me change this help 
[00:20:30]  everyone change this uh the  great thing about michael moore  which i witnessed last night he  always starts out really strong  and then he always loses it by  the end he can't bring it all  together no no uh i look i got  no problem with him he's i i i  think at times he comes off as  sincere you know he's probably  very frustrated he's a nice  man um i think he genuinely  does care about people i don't  know if he cares about the  long-term country thing like he 
[00:21:00]  makes it sound like uh i think  he's delusional in some aspects  of of what the problem is in  this country especially when he  talks about detroit and flint and  stuff um but i don't agree with  a lot of what he says i do agree  that you know it would be nice if  we could do something uh about  this issue because any you know  anytime anybody's killed in one  of these things it's you can't  just write it off like well that's  business as usual that's that's  just what the statistics show  because people don't like hearing 
[00:21:30]  that their statistics or their  loved ones are just statistics but  um you know until a a real  solution comes about and i haven't  heard one on either side i obviously  i really honestly have not heard a  true solution on the um gun rights  uh advocate side or or the gun  control side it's just both sides  i don't know what's what the the  actual solution is i know i know  what i do as a gun owner um i'm i  consider myself very responsible i 
[00:22:00]  lock up my weapons they're behind a  locked uh door with with an alarm on  it i found a rifle behind a cushion  this week it's just not true yeah i  i put that there so long ago i  forgot it was there jimmy i'm like  what is this it was a loaded rifle  it fired it went through the door we  laughed do you lose guns like people  lose car keys yeah like car keys oh  here's my 45 here it is i don't oh i  put it somewhere you are a very  responsible gunner i make sure it's 
[00:22:30]  locked up so we know that by now so  they don't get stolen um because that  that seems to be a problem that's the  problem a lot of gun uh control  activists have is that legal gun  owners yes they have the guns but a  lot of times they're stolen and then  they enter this illegal market and it's  just more illegal guns um you got to be  responsible you got to make sure you  know you you do everything you can to  keep them out of uh children's hands and  out of the hands of uh criminals and by  locking them up that's that's what you  got to do i either have them locked or on 
[00:23:00]  me i think you got to get kind of  radical about the whole thing yeah yeah i  was telling you the other day i think if  you use an illegal gun and you kill  somebody you should die that's like the  idea of horrific penalties i know that  sounds crazy right yeah but here's a  person that took an illegal gun and  killed somebody why should you be able  to live right people go oh well that's  nuts well maybe not maybe that will make  people think uh twice the next time i  think any gun crimes should uh be  amazing penalties i this uh kid that 
[00:23:30]  just got shot um up in the bronx uh they  just caught uh what do you mean the kid  the four-year-old yeah yeah it was a  teenager right yeah yeah 17 year old  demetra of course all right legal gang  violent guns and stuff and and i think  if they catch him sorry to interrupt you  how'd they catch him did he somebody  trying to think somebody finally said  something because that's usually what  happens no one says shit when it's just  you know your basic gang shoot up but  when a kid gets hit then they start you  know let's fucking talk let's get the  police in this let's help the police 
[00:24:00]  um unfortunately that doesn't happen  all the time and will so what happens  to this kid now how many years does he  get oh man because the four-year-old  gets no more years by the way no years  right you're no more years none more  years for you that drives me fucking  nuts a lot of no more years how many  years will this kid get you know  outside of prison a lot of times  because of the age um they they plea it  out they you know they talk about how  it's just detrimental to put somebody in  prison for a length of a long period  of time for life and oh my god look at 
[00:24:30]  his upbringing this that and they just  pour this bullshit on right and it just  perpetuates the whole thing but  ridiculous consequences for people  using illegal ridiculous i'm all that  would completely help the situation it  really would yeah and you'd have to be a  complete psychopath to then finally you  know use an illegal gun yeah and it will  still happen but maybe you knock down the  numbers a bit and i am for uh i am for  for you know background checks i go  through it i am for that you know and i  know the nra even has a problem with 
[00:25:00]  certain aspects of that yeah but um and  it wouldn't have helped in this  situation not at all nothing would have  helped in this even even if you changed  the laws drastically it wouldn't help  this case if you could go back in time  he still know that right go in as an  american citizen purchase weapons and if  if if really all fucking things came  apart he wasn't able to purchase a  weapon right i was making bombs yeah he  was making bombs that he would have  just thrown into the theater then and  i'm starting to read the eyewitness 
[00:25:30]  accounts and yeah and i only read this  shit for the radio show like if i wasn't  doing this radio show i would avoid all  this stuff you know what it's happening  you don't need you know the details you  just could imagine how horrific it was  but i guess for the show to try to be  informed this asshole was you know  picking his victims he was pulling them  up by the hair and shooting them in the  head jesus christ and did he really is  that what he was doing oh fuck yeah man  there's some eyewitness accounts out  there now that are just chilling wait  people that were playing dead or that  were dead he was just support according 
[00:26:00]  to one eyewitness account he was just  picking his victims and he was demanding  them to stand up because he sees some of  them laying down to try to kind of you  know cover up or hide and he's demanding  them to stand up and then he's shooting  them terrible this fucking guy you don't  like he has to wear a mouth guard there's a  picture of in the daily news right he has  to wear a mouth guard because uh he  spits on the guard really do you  fucking be the guy that kills him and i  would take my fucking that i would take  the consequence you wish your guard would  do that no and i understand they got 
[00:26:30]  their lives to protect families and all  that shit but there's no reason as a  society that we should allow this  fucking piece of shit to live another  day yeah he's garbage you know but  we'll argue the case for years and  maybe maybe it'll be a death penalty  case but now he's faking crazy so maybe  they don't do the death penalty thing  with this asshole and then a bunch of  years will go by and his life will be  his life in prison yeah he will be  suffering god it drives me nuts it is 
[00:27:00]  ridiculous take him out back shoot him  and throw him in a dumpster i'm serious  that's what the russians did to citizen  x he was convicted they knew it was him  the guy who killed all those kids for  all those years when he was done they  just took him into a room and fucking  blew his brains out there's something  to be said about that absolutely is  and don't say we're better than that  because i really don't know i really  don't believe we are in the end we're  not everyone knows he did it right  there's no doubt here a theater full of  people saw him walk in there's bombs in  his apartment you know we know it's him 
[00:27:30]  he's a real piece of shit yeah that we're  and you're right we're not better than  that we're come on stop well that's the  argument people say we're just better  than that and uh really are we yeah  maybe you take a few of these guys out  back shoot them and throw them in a  dumpster maybe that'll make us you know  the next person think a little harder  about it yeah because he really did it's  funny he's for crazy guy he really did  protect himself right by not getting  shot he could have went out in a blaze  of glory right but he didn't want to 
[00:28:00]  no man and now we have to deal with  this piece of shit yeah spitting on the  guard do you but the only thing is this  let me tell you something jail guards  are not exactly spit on guys those are  not guys that are cool with being spit  on like they're like fucking convict  tough yeah you know they're waiting  until they can hurt this dude there's  some way they they want to fucking but  they got they got cameras and all that  shit now you know that's like yeah you  talk to you know some of these nypd guys  and they say wow man times are different 
[00:28:30]  and i'm sure it's it's the same way in  these jails and prisons yeah you know i'm  sure like in the 70s and 80s yeah there  was some fucking justice going on a  picture of the daily news of him with  the fucking mouth guard really he's  never got a little towel around his  mouth so he doesn't spit on guards but  the way to get him to stop spitting on  guards is to let a guard knock his teeth  out a glove and knock his teeth out if you  spit on me again you break his jaw  wire his jaw shut yeah that's how you  stop him from spitting on the guards  right that'd be great oh just fucking 
[00:29:00]  pound his jaw he's the joker he's the  joker are you yeah you're not  coward is what you are dick bag uh the  volleyball story is horseshit it is  okay english gent from the united  kingdom that's why i didn't go off like  that saying this is bullshit i said this  is what i heard i wanted to know if it  was they've been told that they can  cover up a bit if the weather isn't  warm all right fuck's sake stop with the  disinformation i did what disinformation 
[00:29:30]  i'm just reading his thing holy shit you  asshole guys asking if it was true and  now we know it's not so we put it out  there why can't that guy just sit back  and enjoy the show fucking cocksucker  it's very uptight amazing we're supposed  to be the ones uptight you're supposed to  just enjoy this shit enjoy the show right  another clip from michael moore he takes on the  trayvon martin case the trayvon martin case  where george zimmerman the victim hadn't been  carrying a gun indisputably trayvon martin would 
[00:30:00]  still be alive and he might be dead that he had a  holy mother of fuck why doesn't anybody say  that if he didn't have a gun trayvon martin would  be alive right and and zimmerman might be dead so  what the fuck and that by the way would have gotten no  attention in the news oh no no not at all  beautifully trayvon martin would still be alive  it was the fact that he had a gun whichever side of the argument you  believe and we don't know all the facts and 
[00:30:30]  it may or may not come out in the court case but  the bottom line is if a gun hadn't physically been on george zimmerman  then trayvon martin couldn't have been shot george zimmerman was perfectly  legally entitled to carry this firearm around that firearm led to trayvon martin  being shot yeah that's how it works can i say something about that um about the  trayvon martin thing i mean let me put it this way um let's say george zimmerman's  right when he says that trayvon martin was  tried to kill him all right um but it was george zimmerman who was told by the 
[00:31:00]  police to quit stalking no okay stop right here michael moore's right though he was told by the  no you don't even jimmy the police did say that right yeah yeah i heard it you're right this is  so fucking this is where michael moore on that fucking loses me when he pulls this  bullshit what this that is a lie just give me some facts out yeah that is a fucking lie  right there the police didn't tell zimmerman to stop stalking trayvon  the 911 operator who has no authority to tell anybody on scene anything told him we don't 
[00:31:30]  need you to do that when he said he was following trayvon he was following him because he's the  neighborhood watch guy waiting to see if trayvon is doing anything because he's it's just it's an  odd situation that he's looking at it's not your run-of-the-mill normal evening  he's looking because they have had break-ins in that development so he's looking to see what 
[00:32:00]  trayvon was doing this is his testimony his fucking report to the police uh so when when uh  he's they when he said he was following him and the 911 operator said we don't need you to do that  it doesn't mean the police told him to stop stalking him michael moore is fucking lying here  i think it's your word against his i guess oh god well i mean i i've heard on the tape when the 
[00:32:30]  police told him to stop following who answers 911 i thought the police you are right yeah i guess  we're gonna have to agree to disagree on this one because michael moore the police said don't  follow and he followed michael moore was on cnn you're just on this silly radio show shut up  you're all crazy i might have to believe michael moore over you yeah cnn is much more reputable  why i wouldn't if the cops told me not to follow wow i'd go home wow it was george zimmerman who was  told by the police to quit stalking this boy and and he was the one who was committing the infraction 
[00:33:00]  against the law by disobeying the police and going after trayvon martin holy doesn't trayvon martin  actually have the right to kill george zimmerman if george zimmerman is stalking him and and the  police have told him not to stalk him well there you go the l is silent and stalked by the way  holy shit is that guy just a fucking first of all he's lying and talking about misinformation  this motherfucker did pierce correct him yeah i doubt it no you don't first of all you don't have 
[00:33:30]  you can't use deadly physical force when someone's following you calm you can't oh god that's fucking  calm calm you all right you're all right the police hold on i'm calming anthony down calm you're  all right you're all right yeah i'll take it away now it's hot you can't use deadly physical force  right for someone following you right it can't be done you can't he says trayvon had uh the ability  to use the stand your ground uh use of deadly physical force because he's being followed what's 
[00:34:00]  this stalked thing uh and then secondly the fucking police didn't tell him anything the police did not  tell him to stop stalking trayvon don't fucking oh look at those fucking tits all right everything's  good right yeah you don't remember about trayvon martin anymore oh sure he remembers he's the only  things that is trayvon fucking that girl and he gets angry oh my god that does i gotta thank uh i don't  even know who this is bc justin on twitter just sent a nice volleyball picture you think she plays 
[00:34:30]  the u.s team or is it just a model man i don't know i know i know you can see that one  she's just holding a volleyball she's a bit sweaty her nipples are popping out i don't think that's one  of our athletes i'm gonna have to tweet that picture for everybody look at that isn't that nice  see you forget about the george zimmer and trayvon martin yeah you see that uh but the the fact that  michael moore is able to go on a national forum like that and spread fucking out and out lies 
[00:35:00]  about what happened is uh that's where he fucking gets me to the point where i can't stand him well  that's where appears uh loses me he's gonna challenge people on stuff and this is he's not a bad interviewer  but he doesn't challenge people on anything because michael moore's just ill-informed i don't think he's  lying how is that motherfucker ill-informed when he's doing nothing but commenting on these things  where you better fucking be informed if you're gonna uh comment on it on a national forum on cnn 
[00:35:30]  he's going on a show and commenting on shit he knows nothing about the police never said shit to him  but think about this zimmerman about uh uh following anybody he's only on that show because he said  peers made a good case for him to come like peers people love to cart him out because he gets people  upset yeah he didn't go out and ask to be on that show they he probably said nah they're like look we  really want you to come on so he's just giving his opinion on shit he's probably he's probably not  he's probably just thinks he's telling the truth that he's wrong yeah well you know what he doesn't 
[00:36:00]  think he's telling the truth that's what i get from this i know i know from reading enough of his shit  and he reads these fucking uh reports these police reports he knows what happened it's fucking bullshit  yeah but i think it's also bullshit that michael moore uh said that he was talked into going on  piers morgan i think michael moore loves he loves it i think that's kind of bullshit as well a lot of  bullshit last night well the police though i mean it's hard to to get over sam you can't argue that 
[00:36:30]  right police tell you to do something if you don't follow them and things happen all right you should  listen to the call right i know your fucking little act here you two we should uh we should get more  clips from michael moore on piers morgan there were it was a whole hour of stuff on guns  why have them on for like why have them on for an hour unless you just want to upset people yes there's  no i think there's a lot of people you can have on there why there's a lot of people you can have on  too i tuned in about 10 15 minutes late so i would assume he was already talking brad thorne said that 
[00:37:00]  he said he was he was the guest for an hour yeah fucking when when he says shit like this his  credibility for anything should go out the fucking window for his credibility on his gun control  arguments on his fucking arguments about uh urban uh crime and his his delusional fucking take on  that uh yeah everything just gets thrown out the fucking window when he out and out is lying about  what happened how many people were uh shot yesterday in chicago i think you tweeted right 15 no it was in 
[00:37:30]  15 minutes um in 15 minutes uh six people were shot six people shot one killed in 15 minutes in  chicago where by the way um the ability to carry a gun a concealed weapon is completely against the  law you're not allowed to do it today so all these people what they they were law-abiding citizens  and no do we have that stat we were asking for that yesterday about uh how many the top five or ten 
[00:38:00]  uh gun states like what's the stats yeah yeah yeah oh that just shows one of the interns do that or  something here instead of having them fucking run around and dribble balls outside whatever it is  they do yeah yeah i want the stats yesterday that just shows there's too many guns out there  oh my god there's just too many guns oh my way you're right though they're really it's just too many  guns too many illegal ones there are yeah too many guns and that's why this shit is happening  oh boy oh jesus bowling for behave hey hey hey hey yeah you fat fuck love that song it really is a 
[00:38:30]  fucking toe tap and diddy is that that should be a fucking club music hit oh really everyone you're  talking about is one should be dancing right have a lot of people leaving the dance floor and folding  their arms yeah we don't want to ball for behave right ain't bowling all behaving  um so there you go can we get more clips from michael moore please uh yeah sure 
[00:39:00]  mediaite might have some of the juicier stuff just throw his credibility out the window because he's uh  he's passionate about america what is mediaite by the way are they a fucking liberal side or  conservative i uh i don't know okay maybe they're neither to be honest with you because  well they might lean they might lean liberal maybe but they're they got clips from all over  the place all over the ball field i like going there yeah i like going to media police told them 
[00:39:30]  i don't know i you know i don't know the answer to that so i don't even want to just say what i just  said well you're withdrawing your testimony i don't know someone that knows this shit more i just i  just go there and i'll see a clip or two i want to check out and i'll do that so i don't know  what's that michael moore clip is that a good one it's one we played we played that one okay  oh god that fuck so you missed out on the michael moore here someone's tweeting me 
[00:40:00]  zimmerman gets his head smashed in by no he wasn't f you he was told to not follow him no he wasn't  the 9-1-1 operator said we don't need you to do that not knowing any of the situation the the  the 9-1-1 operator is totally free to say any tell any suggestions they want it's not a fucking  authority figure it's not the police the 9-1-1 operator is not a police officer has no authority 
[00:40:30]  to tell the person on scene that is better fit to decide what to do or not do the 9-1-1 operator  doesn't have the ability to tell you what to do or not do anthony this tweet's coming in yeah  was anthony cumia there uh-huh he is full of it about trayvon am i really weren't there no but i've  read fucking i i've read so much uh about uh the witness testimony maybe they're like the police  reports uh the physical evidence that's been released to the public i've i've read all that 
[00:41:00]  i've pawed through it because i i need to make informed statements about things you're making  statements based on emotion so shut the fuck up wow god michael moore's lying he's a liar michael  moore is a liar i'm willing to say that and not uh have any um uh uh fear of uh retribution because  that is a fucking out and out lie well let's get him on our show yeah do it i don't know how we do  that he came in once yeah it was terrific the police told him nothing stalking what yeah but 
[00:41:30]  he was stalking he was stalking trayvon stalking stalking stalking you have the right to not be  stalked shut up what else is going on you have a good night yeah not too shabby you know hanging out  before i go to bed i always look at my twitter feed uh it's hard not to that's why i don't sleep well  and it's i always know when ants up the same time i am you know look and i'll see 4m now and so in 
[00:42:00]  the middle of some fucking rant argument they never told him shit i'm like that boy  yeah i really am an ass no it's just funny to just peek in on the timeline yeah yeah i i was having  some fun tweets though yesterday too you know i was tweeting little things people asking you know  questions people like asking me questions i don't know why but i try to answer them especially with  pictures i like just getting pictures i saw the one picture i was just popping it in they asked if you 
[00:42:30]  had a guard dog i think yeah and i just put some ugly bitch up there that chick was horrendous she was  heinous yeah and then uh people were asking um uh if i had my uh pistol with me next to the pool so i took  a picture of of you know my table next to me and of course the pistol's there with a little glass of  beer and uh and my phone was on the table too and they're like how did you take a picture what do you  have two iphones and i said why yes you are so i took a picture of my two phones and the gun and the 
[00:43:00]  beer laying on there like well how did you take that picture how did you with the ipad oh yeah i thought  it would be kind of funny to do it right uh and then someone asked if i had hollow points so of  course i have to send that picture at least you're openly admitting you got two phones nowadays  yeah well i couldn't do that when i was uh going out with you know the model she would have been  very upset hey do you uh two phones did you get your new helicopter yet uh i yeah i actually i got  the other one out of the tree well you found it that's my mullet uh shot yeah why are you growing 
[00:43:30]  a mullet i don't know i just think it's kind of funny i got no there's a reason no there's no  reason i just completely somebody told you look good with no one ever said that and saw joe dirt and  he's like you know what the only thing i'm growing is lazy oh i have to go to uh what's  up with the helicopter hog um i got the other one out of the tree actually why was it in the tree my  uh buddy vinnie got out of the tree he went to the house yeah knocked on the door like children 
[00:44:00]  hey hey mither i gotta get my helicopter out of your tree uh yeah that was the one that um was stuck  in the tree but uh i'm getting kind of good at flying that thing around it's pretty fun  why are you getting a new one there's better shit out there now no i'm not getting a new one  who said that oh my goodness no i got the old one out of the tree you should get two so now you  could film the one in the air well i was taking some pictures i was filming it with the uh with my  iphone because when you hover the thing you can put it up wherever you want and just put the 
[00:44:30]  goddamn controller down put the ipad down and you just take pictures with it and then people were  saying uh you know do your neighbors get mad because i was kind of hovering in their yard the other  day but i don't spy on them or anything so they're you know i'm not gonna get mad at that  uh dan miller is schooling me and jimmy oh good or jimmy and i uh opie and jimmy do you guys know  what makes a gun illegal possession by a criminal criminals break laws that's why they're called  criminals the problem isn't with the amount of guns in existence the problem is behavioral yes do you 
[00:45:00]  see that thanks for schooling me dan miller that's just right there dan miller this this is why  you can't have a discussion and it's because of horses asses like dan miller it's not as easy as  that dan we understand that i know the basic cause criminals to the shooting yeah but the fact is  there is an abundance of illegal guns out there so i don't need to hear the basic argument the  trigger doesn't pull itself i get it i get it but the bottom line is there's too many illegal guns 
[00:45:30]  out there there's too many floating around there are well there's a lot of uh there's there's a lot  of illegal things that are um very easily accessible um unfortunately guns one of them guns are the ones  i'm worried about falling i don't care if people if drugs fall into people's hands and they do it and  i know that can cause them to do things to other people but that's them whenever i make that analogy  i'm never trying to compare right the the danger between one or the other i'm just comparing the 
[00:46:00]  availability and why they're available and the fact that passing more laws rarely what a big ass on  that chick jesus i'm not really sure what is she sorry what does she do does she um she's one of our  volleyball volleyball oh okay what do you think i'm not really sure no i don't like that it looks like  the the ass belongs on another body yes it looks photoshopped uh thank you power dumpling but i i'm  going to go with a fail on this yeah i don't like that one i'm sorry i'm sorry like that one at all  if you have a big ass like that you got to have bigger boobies yeah it's got to be more proportionate 
[00:46:30]  keep trying though thank you yeah i'll continue oh no i was done yeah yeah yeah it's just uh there  are a lot of illegal guns i want to thank dan miller because uh i was schooled thank you dad i was  schooled on that one dan miller shut your face enough of your obsessive argument he sounds like one of  those obsessive guys we get it guns don't shoot themselves no one is saying they do no one is  saying that you should spank the guns i'm saying there's too many illegal ones floating around 
[00:47:00]  unless they make uh the laws that are in place right now and start enforcing them instead of  legislating new laws that just affect uh legal gun owners i'm fine with that i'm fine with that  that's really i think you make the penalties way harsher harsh because people ask me like what's  your solution but these guys aren't these guys aren't scared of going to jail because they're  carrying guns so they don't get killed like for them the penalty is getting shot right so the idea  of going to jail isn't scary because they're carrying guns so they don't get shot i think it's a whole 
[00:47:30]  spectrum and if you make uh the penalties much harsher you're gonna knock you're gonna weed some of  those people out yeah i really believe that damn look at christian pale you're not gonna get rid of  all of them obviously ever christian bell we're going over there to uh aurora yeah going to the  hospital saying hi well laying down some flowers that's all about guilt you think oh god yeah you're  the star of the movie and you hear what happened you're like it's killing you inside i'm sure he's  a good guy on top of it but he's like i gotta i gotta i gotta go there what's that motorcycle high 
[00:48:00]  speed chase in and out jesus uh yeah that you know you think it's guilt though oh there's gotta be a  lot of guilt associated with that i'm not saying he's not a good guy i don't think so wow that's  i think he's just you're the star of the movie and you know indirectly because you were starring in  this movie people are now dead that's got to play with your mind a little bit i wouldn't think that  would you don't think that would come to mind of course it would you're just in a movie how somebody 
[00:48:30]  interprets anything or twists it around or uses it i think indirectly you're feeling holy fuck could  have been any movie i guess you know but but it was the movie he was in yeah well i don't know  either way he did a great thing yesterday yeah that was pretty cool and no fanfare on his part  it wasn't like you know hey film me right i didn't see any real video of it i guess uh a couple of  pictures um we should take a break when we get back i saw a headline i don't even know what this 
[00:49:00]  means brett farve is thinking about coming back to football could someone look that up it can't be  yeah he's coaching uh high school football oh oh but see how they do it on the news of course  they showed a clip of him in a in an nfl uniform oh boy i think it was it was the vikings and and  you're sitting there like really they don't why can't they just say yeah he's gonna coach some  dumb football team that has nothing to do with the nfl because no one would care about that it's  more intriguing if they say he'll be brett farve back bat involved in football they got my attention 
[00:49:30]  i'm like what what's that about so uh also uh penn state we didn't talk about penn state yesterday  we we uh ran out of time but yeah we kind of didn't we yeah did we talk about this from the  sanctions no we talked about the uh not yesterday no no when did we talk about it well day before  that all went down this whole thing is a blur to me i know there was a we were going to talk about  the picture in the paper where everyone was so shocked that the sanctions were so harsh yeah yeah 
[00:50:00]  uh people very delusional over there they certainly are extremely delusional and now we got a clip of  a penn state fan comparing the sanctions to oh no the aurora shooting no to 911 911 oh my god we got  the audio next and our fine mayor mayor bloomberg yeah what'd she say right well uh wants to maybe go  after the alcohol thing uh next oh there you go cool all right because he's not going to stop he's not  going to go after nathan's um and he's going to continue to have armed bodyguard he really is do 
[00:50:30]  as i say not as i care what an arrogant rich douchebag this guy is hey i'm trying now i'm i'm  i'm trying to stay strong with the sugary drink thing yeah but they have a picture in the paper of  this uh this uh lawmaker or i don't know whoever the fuck someone on the committee whatever yeah yeah  holding a giant cup a big giant just a giant this is how much soda you could get type cup yeah yeah 
[00:51:00]  but i'm still trying to stay strong on this one it's in the paper if you want to check it out it's  giant i think she could put it on her head but you could also cover her entire head couldn't you  buy a diet coke that's that big too like well the diet coke is really bad with all the shit they have  in there diet coke is dangerous it's just it's all the chemicals they use it's a weak fucking thing  to go after it's it's the government getting involved where they don't fucking but if you want  to punish big fatos we're not covering you right how about that you want to fucking eat that much 
[00:51:30]  and drink that much you're paying uh double the airline make them pay that way like if people want  to be big and fat they're willing to pay those penalties that's their right just don't fucking  cry when you can't when you can't cram into an airline seat just don't fucking cry when it's been  seen that you're you're constant eating and obesity is making you uh sick and the hospital and the rest  of us don't want to pay for it yeah you slob but you have the right to do it i'm just saying the size

[00:54:30]  And the rocket's red glare, the most bursting in air,  Gave proof to the night that our flag was still there.  Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave  O'er the land of Christ, and the home of that Christ. 
[00:55:00]  How many years ago was that, Iraq?  22 years ago.  Holy shit, come on.  22 years ago.  What?  Come on.  There's no way.  Roseanne's national anthem, 22 years ago.  Wow, that is.  Where was it that she sang that?  That was at a, um, I'm going to go with Padres. 
[00:55:30]  Padres game.  I'm going to go Padres.  That was 1990.  Oh, I nailed it!  Damn.  A win for me.  I didn't look that shit up.  They're roasting her on Comedy Central now.  Oh, I know.  Cool.  She's crazy.  Oh, you don't want them roasting her?  What?  I am.  No issue with that?  I like Padres.  She gives bad shit.  Yeah, I like her.  Why don't they ask you to do those?  They never, they'll give me nothing. 
[00:56:00]  Why, though?  What's their problem with you?  There's somebody or a couple.  There's obviously some kind of problem with you.  There's always been an issue with me there.  Why?  Because I just, for whatever reason, I'm not what they like.  Did you piss someone off?  I don't know, or even care at this point.  It's so obvious you should be part of some of these things.  Or at least asked.  But they haven't been good to me since they were booking a show called Premium Blend.  Wow.  It's why I never did a special for them.  Because they made me wait and wait and wait. 
[00:56:30]  And they kept passing me over.  It's like, it is what it is.  I was passed over!  That's exactly what it is.  You start to feel like Fredo.  And then I did Tough Crowd and stuff with that.  But that was all Colin.  That had nothing to do with that.  Right, right.  True.  So, and then they gave me the one roast.  But only because it was a later replacement.  And Saget requested me.  After Tough Crowd went off the air, not one thing.  So.  Jesus.  That's ten years ago.  Yeah.  About.  Almost ten.  And they, I could have done a special for them.  And I did that one thing for Stefano. 
[00:57:00]  But, you know.  But in general, they just.  And I know Doug, the guy that runs it.  Like, I have no relationship with Comedy Central at all.  I don't hate them.  I just have zero relationship with them.  Yeah.  And that's their choice.  Jams.  But whatever.  I mean, it's fine.  Not everybody's going to love you.  It is what it is.  Hey, I think we've got to start promoting our Chicago gig.  Yes.  Because we're very excited.  We're going to be there in a couple weeks at this point, right?  Friday, August 10th.  Three weeks.  115 Bourbon Street.  And that's on 115th Street in Marionette Park. 
[00:57:30]  It's right outside Chicago.  Doors are open at three.  Maybe a little bit earlier.  Get there.  And it's going to be fun.  Sam will be doing something.  We'll all be there.  We're going to try to get some good guests because Comical Cons is happening in Chicago.  So we should be able to get some guests from Comic-Con.  And the oddest thing you own, you need to.  We have to encourage you guys.  Bring stuff down for a cash prize.  Bring the oddest thing you own down.  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  And we'll bring you on stage or whatever.  To like a Pawn Stars thing with it.  Yes.  We're going to have Chip impressions.  And I want to see a look for Chip.  So it's called Chip Off the Old Block.  Because you'll see at these Comic-Con, the new video is up right now.  Sam put it up last night.  It's actually very funny.  And I'm wearing different hats in these next series of videos.  Because people recognize me too much.  I don't know what to do for Chip's look.  There has to be a look for it.  Because what happens is when people recognize me as a comic, I've had guys actually stop me and go, 
[00:58:30]  Why are you talking like that?  Oh, no.  Which is embarrassing, but it kills the bit.  And then people who do just recognize me are laughing along with the bit.  Right.  You don't want that.  And I don't want to do a Borat thing where they're freaked out.  But I just want them to think that an asshole is interviewing them.  I don't want them to realize I'm a comic doing a bit.  The uncomfortableness of it all.  The visual brings the whole thing together, man.  I mean, the audio is hilarious.  But now when you see the faces and the stupid elephant hat, that's way too tight on your head.  It's a cloth hat that goes over my head with an elephant trunk.  Oh, my God.  And two giant ears. 
[00:59:00]  It's like knitted.  And boy, does that woman get fucking hot under the collar.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  And we're doing worst breath, which will be judged by our own E-Rock.  So if your breath is bad or you want to make your breath bad.  Yeah, I want to thank E-Rock for volunteering to be the judge for that contest.  That was very nice of him.  Thanks, E-Rock, for volunteering.  You did volunteer for this one, right?  No, I think it's nobody here wants to do this, so we'll make E-Rock do it.  You would draft on this one.  Is that what you're feeling?  No, I think that's what you said.  Oh.  Oops.  But I'm glad to do it.  Thank you.  This young intern brings everything with one trip. 
[00:59:30]  One trip.  Should have made another trip for this.  Spoon and another trip for...  Coffee, spoon.  Young Connors trying.  Pottage cheese.  Young Connors.  Connors is a good boy.  Wait, he brought everything at once, though?  That's pretty impressive, sir.  He balances it all on his giant coffee, doesn't he?  That's Rob.  Is Rob the best guy?  Yeah, but Sal has a huge issue with Rob, because Sal thinks that Rob is very cocky.  Rob threw some garbage at Sal's face the other day.  Damn!  Just as a goof.  You mean figuratively, like he was bad-mouthing him? 
[01:00:00]  No.  Literally threw garbage at his face.  Crumpled up some garbage and threw it into space.  He described Eric's shirt as shit brown.  I heard shit brown, yeah.  That's right.  Good for Rob.  Rob and his webbed feet.  Oh, he's the webbed foot guy.  Here comes Sal DeRosa.  Sal DeRosa.  Hi, Sal.  He was pissed.  Glasses.  I worked up fucking with those glasses.  When's your internship up, Sal?  What's up?  When's your internship up?  Hopefully, you know, I get a good grade and might be able to get a job here.  Way to go with it.  Thanks.  Way to not know how to do anything. 
[01:00:30]  What do you got on that, Rob?  Oh, that motherfucker threw shit at me the other day.  Uh-oh.  What kind of shit?  He was, like, wiping himself off with these fucking paper towels.  Yeah.  And he thought he'd be cute by fucking throwing at me.  He caught me completely off guard.  And what'd you do?  Um, I used some words.  Ooh.  He's pretty fucking cocky, isn't he?  Yeah.  I mean, I'm cocky too, but, like, he does it in a fucking stupid way.  He's cock-sure.  Next time he does that, you punch him in the teeth.  Oh, damn.  You got my permission. 
[01:01:00]  Sal is very prideful of not being an intern anymore, even though it's been, like, what,  I don't know, three weeks or something.  He's very, like, three weeks.  It's been about three weeks.  He's like, I'm not an intern.  You can't throw things at me.  You are an intern.  And the rest of us are like, whatever, you're all interns.  It was still a dick thing to do.  I would never do that to anyone on staff when I was an intern.  That's true.  It was disrespectful, is the thing.  Disrespectful.  But you know what?  It was badass.  It was fucking badass.  He shot some balls, but fuck him now.  Sal doesn't like that he's not getting staff respect from the intern. 
[01:01:30]  He's getting intern bullshit.  Yeah.  Let me tell you, Rob, he would never throw a paper towel at me.  Right.  He wouldn't do it.  What would you do, Sam, if he did that to you?  The rest of his semester would be horrible for him.  Living hell.  Living hell.  But Sal's got no power, so you might as well just shit all over him.  That's how Rob feels.  You might as well still be an intern at this point.  I know, right?  Well, how can we take some time?  Poor Rob.  He's just getting beat up in here.  He's not the front of himself.  Yeah.  Well.  But at least Rob knows how to bring the banana, the cottage cheese, 
[01:02:00]  and the coffee, and one trip.  Unlike yesterday where Connor had to take two trips to do that task.  He's not confident.  He's working on this.  That was weird, though.  Yeah.  Connor's a weird dude.  That was really strange.  All right.  We're done with your Sal.  All right.  It's not going on.  I'm going to go back to photocopying some stuff.  Great.  Oh, is that what you're doing?  Yeah.  So what else about Chicago?  That's it?  Yeah.  I mean, it's going to be a very, very fun trip.  I'm doing a gig Saturday night with Artie, Nick, and Attell.  But I'm honestly looking forward to this broadcast from hanging out a couple days in Chicago. 
[01:02:30]  I love it.  I've been learning about Chicago by listening to the police scanner out of Chicago on a nightly basis.  Well, I think half of the six people, three people that were shot in Chicago were shot just around the area that we're going to.  Get out of here.  We'll be fine.  I hear it's the south side of Chicago, the baddest part of town.  If you go down there, you better just beware of a man named Leroy Brown.  What?  That's right.  Bad.  Bad.  Leroy Brown.  The baddest man in the whole damn town. 
[01:03:00]  Do you know where Jim Croce knew him from?  They were in the Army together.  Really?  And Leroy Brown was a big, funny dude who went AWOL.  Yeah?  Just one of those guys, and he came back to get his pay, and they arrested him.  They did, huh?  Yeah.  That's a real dude.  That's a bad dude right there.  He was a real dude.  Oh.  Bad.  Leroy Brown.  The baddest man in the whole damn town.  I like Jim Croce.  Oh, he was great, dude.  The storyteller guy.  Yeah, another Harry Chapin type dude.  Did it, did it, did it.  Oh. 
[01:03:30]  Is that a weird accent?  Yeah.  He leaves the S's on things.  Yeah.  He like.  I'm on rings.  I want everybody's.  Every?  Yeah, he's the best.  Every.  Every.  Every.  He got a El Dorado 2.  El Dorado.  He got a 32 gun.  32 gun.  He got a razor in his.  Shit.  He came strapped.  Yeah, really.  You know what happened to Leroy Brown?  He tried to fuck Doris at the bar. 
[01:04:00]  Yep.  And, uh, Doris was married to a guy who didn't play games.  No.  No.  He fucking beat up Leroy Brown and left his feet.  Okay.  Didn't like that at all.  I'm all about volleyball pictures today.  Women's volleyball pictures.  Thank you.  I would steep that little bikini bottom in my tee.  Wow.  Sports guy 307, would you?  Yes.  I would just say soak.  Why do you have to say steep and make us all stupid?  Because it's like what you do with tea.  I know.  That's what you actually do.  But most people would just say soak. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, let it steep.  Uh, all right.  So Chicago is going to be great.  We can't wait.  We really can't wait.  It's hard to talk about the live broadcast because we got so much other shit to talk about.  But please show up.  We don't even know if we're going to have a crowd.  Did you wait?  Did you know Jay Scott Hallman?  He's a comedian.  Did we have him on?  Did I just talk about him?  He's that funny southern dude.  He was a, he was like from Alabama and, uh, he was a standup that I know well, but he  would do a joke about getting into a fucking hot tub and how you have to lower your balls. 
[01:05:00]  But, and because he talked in this other way and he would go, you got to let those rascals  steep a bit, which always made me laugh that he called his balls rascals and you got to  let them steep a bit.  That's the other time I heard steep.  Before you can just plunge in.  Yeah.  Let those rascals steep a bit.  He's a funny dude, man.  It's good.  Oh, wow.  Someone has turned me on to some Russian track star.  I'm all about the Olympics now.  Yeah?  You're going to be watching the Olympics?  When does that kick up? 
[01:05:30]  When do they start that whole thing?  I could literally care less about them.  Man, it's Olympics.  I just, how did you care?  No.  Oh, man.  I could care less, I'm sure.  Yeah.  But I mean, not much.  I could care not much less.  By the way, I know what I want to start collecting now.  Oh.  And a couple of them are very expensive.  I think we looked them up, right?  The 8-inch action figures from the 70s.  There's only a few of them.  That's why.  And the, because I had them when I was a kid.  Which action figures?  They were my favorite toy.  From what, though? 
[01:06:00]  I want to say they were Meco.  Meco.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Meco.  M-E-G-O.  These 8-inch action figures, they were really awful, like, of thing and cap.  I just saw Thor one for $5,000.  Let's see.  You can make Kiss ones.  No.  I had those.  If this is an original, the price could be through the roof.  Look up Meco, like, they're awful looking action figures.  You know, you're talking auction prices and 30% goes to the auction house.  That's retail.  I have to make some money. 
[01:06:30]  It's going to be in my shop for a while.  I'll give you $200.  Yeah, but look, it's in the original box.  I mean, it's never been opened.  $225, that's my last offer.  There's a little bit of wear and tear on the back because I used it to beat my son.  $225.  Well, he said $225.  That's what you're going to have to take.  All right.  I'll do it.  All right, write them up, chum.  Now, go to eBay.  Oh, the Meco Museum.  Yay!  You found it.  No.  Sam, no.  No.  Sam.  Sucker. 
[01:07:00]  Sam.  Which collection do you want?  I was shushed.  Why are you shushing people?  You don't shush the boss.  Everybody was shushing.  Superheroes.  Go to the top one.  Eight-inch figures.  Because when I was a kid, these were my favorite toy were these fucking Migos.  They all have the same body but different fabric clothes.  Oh, terrible.  Why do you want those?  Go to eBay.  They're awesome.  They are fucking collectible.  And there's something that reminds me of when I was a kid, I loved them.  So what, you save them for 25 years and you get five bucks per...  There you go.  Now, these are more...  Five bucks back on your investment.  Like, look at the Riddler. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Look, I had that when I was a kid.  You know what?  I kind of remember that.  73.  It's seven and five-eighths.  He's wearing the awful...  He's naked with the fucking purple hair.  It's terrible.  Oh.  I love the Riddler.  How much is that in the box?  It's only a hundred bucks.  A hundred bucks.  I want that Riddler.  It's only a hundred bucks and it came out 30 years ago.  Yeah, but it's not money.  That's not an investment.  Some of them are...  It's collecting.  Some of them are...  What are you collecting?  Look at this Thor one and Captain America online.  They're expensive.  Collecting sucks.  Yeah, it's okay. 
[01:08:00]  No, it's fun.  Unless you have a Honus Wagner.  Collecting sucks.  But it's not an investment.  Do you collect anything besides goods?  Yeah.  I realized that as I was saying that.  Oops.  No, I really don't collect things.  Does this turn you on at all?  No.  Awesome.  They're kind of cool for a nostalgic thing.  If you had an Mego collection, I would just want to be at your house looking at your Mego  and film.  Oh, man.  Really?  No.  But there's only a select few of them.  I don't want 200 of them.  There might be 10 or 12 of them that I had when I was a kid in that whole superhero collection  from that year. 
[01:08:30]  You should have told us this before your birthday passed.  I didn't know.  See, we could have got you a few of these.  I didn't know.  Instead of a horrible stripper.  She'd have loved that.  I still feel bad about that.  Even though she sort of what?  Showed cleavage by the end?  Oh, no.  She showed her big tits and her nipples.  Oh, to you.  Yeah.  That's right.  To you.  Yeah.  That's what we negotiate.  I forgot.  All right.  That's in good condition.  It's in great shape.  Look at Thor.  He's still got the plastic thing on his head.  It looks like a tranny.  Yeah.  Well.  Yeah.  These are awesome.  They're great, right?  Yeah.  I want to get these. 
[01:09:00]  Yay.  Mego.  So buy a few of them.  Instead of you, Mego.  They're only $100 on eBay.  Buy a couple.  That one's $1,400.  $1,400.  Oh.  Jesus.  I'm not going to spend that.  Oh, this is what you got to get.  What the fuck is that?  All of them.  Thor, Captain America, Iron Man, and the Hulk.  That's the motherfucking Avengers.  But how come the fucking back...  They usually have these big back cards.  How come these don't have them?  I guess they were different boxes.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Just a variant.  How much is this all for them?  $900.  You've got $900.  Do that. 
[01:09:30]  Just get that.  Start there.  I don't know what these are worth.  I got an expert that could come down and take a look at these.  My toy expert in Vegas.  Look at the Hulk's awful arms.  I love that these were just terrible toys.  That is terrible, yeah.  I had all of them.  I fucking love these, Mego.  So where are they?  Very primitive.  Maybe your mom still has them.  Dude, but they would beat up even then.  I would want these.  But I remember the fucking shape of the box, and there's the plastic.  So when you held the box, you could feel the hard bottom of the box, and you touch  the top, and you could feel the little give of the plastic, and you knew it was a doll, 
[01:10:00]  like a toy.  Oh, when it was wrapped up.  Yeah.  I fucking knew.  You knew it was like one of the fucking new ones.  Say action figure, not a doll, you fucking pissy-eyed fag.  You're bumming out Anthony's father.  Jesus Christ.  Somewhere.  Yeah, look at that.  Mr. Stretchman, the fucking vintage.  No, it's Mr. Fantastic.  Whatever he is.  That's fantastic.  It's my nickname for myself.  How much is that?  Mr. Stretchman.  $3,000.  He's such a little kid.  He's really a little sweet boy.  He's just a little boy sometimes.  That's too much.  He's such a sweet boy.  How much is that, fucker? 
[01:10:30]  Lizard?  You look at the fucking lizard.  Good luck getting that fucking cheap.  $2,600.  Exactly.  Why is that too much?  The amount of money you supposedly spend on other things, why wouldn't you just say,  That's crazy.  I'm not saying, I'm having my apartment redone.  I want to have a display.  Just buy it.  Treat yourself.  Who's that?  Treat yourself.  I don't want the kiss ones.  I already had them.  Go to the bottom.  Oh, man.  Those are not the original boxes anyway.  I don't need this shit.  They're loose.  What is this?  They're loose.  I guess that's a problem.  That's a custom.  They've got to be the boxes.  Custom.  The original boxes.  Oh, nobody wants that.  Justice society. 
[01:11:00]  My balls.  Justice this.  Roland got like six boxes of wrestling toys shipped to him yesterday.  I saw the tweet.  Oh, boy.  What a great day it was.  Was it?  Did you get any?  Yeah, I got like three boxes.  He tweeted him coming out of here with two boxes filled with shit.  He's awesome.  I said, wow, there's a bunch of shit.  You know who's really going to be happy about that?  That's his other shit.  Yes, I'm sure.  You know what made her happy?  What?  I didn't spend money on them.  Oh, there you go.  That's a plus.  Can I?  Make you happy, too.  Can I turn people on to an Olympic athlete, please? 
[01:11:30]  What do you got?  Is that another car chase?  I guess the end of the motorcycle chase.  The guy's trying to put his bike down gently as the cop is coming toward him and knowing  he's just going to be fucking thrown to the ground.  Can I turn you on to an Olympic athlete?  Because it's all about the Olympics in two days.  Please.  41, bartender.  Thank you.  Let's meet Daria.  D-A-R-Y-A, Sam, please.  Daria.  Daria.  Daria. 
[01:12:00]  What is it?  D-A-Y-R?  D-A-R.  Daria.  Y-A.  Okay.  And then go with Kleshina.  K-L-I-S-H-I-N-A.  Russian track star.  Oh, my God.  Her face alone is fucking very.  Look at this bitch.  Oh, man.  Look at this.  I am rooting for Russia to win a few medals.  Holy fuck.  There's one where she's showing some see-through shit.  Very athletic. 
[01:12:30]  She's got a little baby doll picture online somewhere.  Yeah?  Yeah.  She's pretty.  Nope, that's not the one.  You know what kind of shape you got to be in to fuck her, though?  Like, literally.  Is that a big pussy?  Yeah, it's a big pussy.  Or a cock.  Oh, that's not the best picture of her, by the way.  Oh, man.  What is she?  A little gymnast?  What is she doing?  Look at that.  I'm a breath.  Track?  With a see-through.  Holy shit, where is that?  Oh, that one.  That one in the teddy.  Yeah, there you go.  She's wearing a little teddy.  She's wearing a teddy.  Oh, look.  She's wearing me.  Did you get it, Gregory? 
[01:13:00]  Whoa.  Oh, yeah.  Small, big, dark areolas.  Small boobs, but big, yeah.  Yeah, she's got the nips.  Nippies.  I like a big, dark areola.  She looks like Jan Brady in the fucking middle years.  A little bit.  Yeah, like a little fucking Jan Brady.  She's all right.  She's one of those broads, though.  One picture, she looks great, and the next one, you're like, eh.  I don't know.  You know what I mean?  She looked pretty good in those other pictures, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like that.  Hey, gun sales spike in Colorado after massacre. 
[01:13:30]  Happens every time.  No surprise there, right?  People start thinking, uh-oh, they're going to put out some restrictions, so let's buy  them up now.  Right.  And then violent theater scene to be cut from upcoming Gangster Squad movie.  This drives me nuts.  That's weird.  This is stupid.  This is knee-jerk shit.  Yeah.  That's like The Watch.  The movie The Watch was supposed to be called Neighborhood Watch, and they took that out  because of the Trayvon Martin thingy.  Why?  That's just...  And now it's called The Watch.  You don't know what the fuck it... 
[01:14:00]  It could be about a fucking wristwatch.  That's just dumb shit.  Who knows?  That's just dumb shit we do that means nothing in the end.  It means nothing.  You're right.  It really means nothing.  Not putting out the Batman comic.  It just means nothing.  See...  So they're getting rid of the scene from the Gangster Squad movie.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't they get rid of...  And I don't want this.  Mm-hmm.  But it's the Batman movie itself that might, you know, bring up some crazy fucking visuals.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yep.  Yeah, yeah.  But they know taking that out of the theaters would be absolutely crazy. 
[01:14:30]  That's a juggernaut.  Not.  Can't do that.  I said it wrong, didn't I?  Yeah.  And I tried to save myself.  Juggernaut?  Not.  Like that juggernaut.  And then I panicked and I didn't know.  And I said, ah, fuck, if I say it both ways, someone will...  It's hilarious, though.  I really panicked there.  But if you want to, like, do something, you would take the Batman movie out of theaters. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Oh, that Josh Brolin's in that movie?  Nick Nolte, you get it, huh?  Josh Brolin's a good actor.  Sean Penn.  Damn it.  He's better than his father.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But that drives you nuts when they do that, Jimmy?  The knee-jerk shit?  Oh, Jesus.  It's unnecessary.  It really is, right?  Oh, look, they're shooting up a movie theater.  Yeah.  Yeah, there's no...  But look.  They must not like that.  It's like...  But to imply that something that real happened...  Why wouldn't you leave this in?  Jeez, they come through the screen. 
[01:15:30]  I would love to see that scene.  Yeah.  Of course.  Oh, no.  It's going to inspire a lot of people to do it.  Like, it's just...  There's such assholes in Hollywood.  They're such...  They're such shallow reactors.  Right.  They're shallow in their reaction.  Very good.  If you're that against violence,  then don't put a fucking shooting scene  in any movie,  you dummies.  Because people get shot every day.  They still make movies about fucking gangbangers.  Yeah.  They get shot in Chicago every day. 
[01:16:00]  Isn't there a real chance  that there would be a copycat guy  that will go to another Batman movie?  So if you really are worried,  that's what you really should do.  I don't want that.  Trust me.  I don't want that.  That would be the copycat aspect of it.  It's copying.  Yeah.  Right.  That is...  There's a chance of that happening  much greater than this shit  with this one scene  they're taking out of that movie.  I guess they feel people will find it disturbing  sitting there watching that.  And I walked by my local theater  and they just had an NYPD guy out there 
[01:16:30]  and you're like,  what is he really doing?  What's that going to do?  He's just standing outside the theater.  Waste of resources.  And you can't frisk anyone  so you don't know  who might be going into the Batman movie  with something.  Yeah.  So that's fake shit too.  Yeah.  That's not going to deter anyone.  You can even see the guys like,  yeah, this is what a guy do for a while.  You know, he doesn't want to be there  and he knows in his heart  that there's really nothing he's preventing. 
[01:17:00]  And he can't do anything.  Yeah.  The police, like I said,  were on scene in Aurora  before anything even happened.  They were there for crowd control  and, you know,  you can't be closer than that.  And it still happens.  So I don't know  what one NYPD guy is going to do.  Nothing against the NYPD.  We support you guys,  but, you know.  They even know it's a joke.  They know it's a joke, right?  Yeah.  They know it's a fucking joke.  It's fake safety.  It's just another fucking detail  for them to have to go to.  That's all they see it as.  Right.  Yeah.  Freaking Sherman Hemsley. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Old Sherman.  74.  Old George Jefferson.  He was a nice man.  All right.  E-Rock.  Do you know how many radio stations  are doing this exact thing right now?  I guess what are the songs  you're going to play for?  Yeah, that's true.  I told you my grandmother  used to hate  when we would be watching  the Jeffersons  and I would talk  through the theme song  because she's like,  I only get to hear that  once a week.  She loved this song?  Oh, she loved it.  And I would talk through it.  Did she, like, 
[01:18:00]  was she sitting there  kind of, like,  moving to it?  Yeah, I would probably  just jump around  and clap  and look for attention  like, up the hill!  You ruined it for her.  But TV theme songs  used to be huge.  And you bring up  a good point.  You couldn't really, like,  record it  and play it when you wanted.  No.  You had to wait.  Moving on up.  You had to wait for this shit.  I was watching an episode  linked to Entertainment Weekly  last night,  which I hate  Entertainment Weekly.  But the episode was funny.  There was a funny scene  between George and, 
[01:18:30]  can you go to  Entertainment Weekly, Sam,  before I bite your fingertips?  There's a funny,  you know how they  touched the race back then  that they just don't  touch anymore.  And as Sam finds that clip,  I just want to say  I'm really surprised  at the lack of  moving on up tweets.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, no, I've seen a lot.  I'm really surprised  that no one really  went with that.  People hit on that,  that he's moving on up.  I don't understand  why you wouldn't  go with that one.  It's very obvious.  I was listening to  some TV show theme 
[01:19:00]  yesterday.  Oh, it was the  Magnum P.I. one?  And you're like,  remember,  because they used to  play them on the radio.  Yeah, of course.  Like the Rockford Files  someone's bringing up here.  Like those are...  They used to put out  compilations.  Greatest American Hero.  Remember then  you used to get a CD  filled with them?  Filled with all the movie,  TV movie themes?  I heard this yesterday.  I'm thinking,  this is kind of  a cool song.  Yeah.  This is a cool  little instrumental.  This is Magnum. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, nowadays  you don't really  think about TV  songs, do you?  Yeah.  The newer ones  just suck, right?  And the Rockford Files  one was a big hit, too.  Remember that  back in the day.  Yeah, remember this one?  Jim Rockford.  I've been watching  that Me TV channel.  I guess Bill Burr  is hooked on that one, too.  Yeah, that's all he talks  about on his podcast.  It's so fucking...  It's hilarious.  They got like...  I've been watching 
[01:20:00]  Canon,  a Quinn Martin production.  Canon.  Just some big fat  fucking insurance  investigator.  Who came up  with that pitch?  It's a big fat  insurance investigator.  I don't remember  the name of the show,  but when Bill  found that channel,  he just was  Twittering every time  a woman got slapped  in this episode,  and he was up to four.  I think it was  the Rockford Files.  It was.  It might have been  the Rockford Files,  but they have like  Gunsmoke or Bonanza. 
[01:20:30]  Me, it's a great  fucking dumb channel,  but if you leave it  on too long,  you'll wake up  to paid programming  for the posty vac.  Why give up  the best part of life  from your life?  Well, you can have  life with posty vac.  Aren't they getting  sued or something?  Yeah.  They're shutting down?  Yeah, they started  doing some insurance  and Medicare shit  that was a little shady  for the cock pump.  Yeah.  This scene is,  this is Jefferson.  What's happening  is they're in 
[01:21:00]  George's house,  and Tom and Helen,  you know,  the interracial couple,  the white man,  the black wife,  are arguing about something.  I think she lost  his pen or something  at home.  So George and Louise  are there.  But this is just  a funny moment.  It might be a second away,  but you could play it  from there, I guess.  I might have taken it  to do the marketing list.  You wrote with it?  Oh.  What are you supposed  to do with a pen? 
[01:21:30]  Paint the walls?  Don't you know  what a strange hand  can do to the nib?  They don't make nibs  like that anymore.  Look, you two,  I don't like no arguments  in my house.  What?  You stay out of this, Louise.  If you want to have  an argument,  you take it upstairs  to your own apartment  where it belongs.  Just as soon as I find out  what happened to my pen.  Now, Helen,  where is it?  It's around,  maybe in the kitchen.  Okay,  and I'd better find it  or I'm going to turn  that apartment upside down. 
[01:22:00]  Tom,  you're just being  plain silly.  No, I'm not.  I have to do my work now.  I'm ready to do my work now,  but I can't  because of you.  You just don't understand.  You know what you are?  You are a...  Uh-oh, here it comes.  He's going to say that.  You're damn right  I'm going to say it.  You are a woman,  a typical woman.  That's a terrible  thing to say.  I don't think  that's so terrible.  I thought he was going  to call her...  John!  That's great. 
[01:22:30]  Is that great?  Yeah,  great payoff.  Is that fucking great?  How old was he  when he filmed that scene?  He was 74 now.  That's probably 76.  So he always played old.  He played old.  So that's 36 years ago.  He's only 38 there.  He looks way older.  Wow.  God damn it.  Really?  He was crazy.  I told you,  he was doing a stand-up  at one point  and he'd come on stage  and it wasn't a full house  and me and Voss  would go to the Carolines  and we did sets with him  and we took him down 
[01:23:00]  to the comedy cellar  to hang out  and eat wings  and he walking,  parking by Washington Square Park  and then walking  with Sherman Hemsley.  He's the...  I mean,  Saget might be close now  but he's the most  recognizable guy.  Oh, man.  Literally,  nobody...  Doesn't matter what age, yeah.  Homeless guys  were like,  do the walk!  Every fucking person.  Jefferson yelled to him.  Every single person  knew who he was.  Really a nice man. 
[01:23:30]  I loved the scene  in All in the Family  when Archie was at,  I guess it was a party  that Jefferson was throwing  and George started getting  into a little bit  of a spat with his mom  and Archie goes,  hey, Jefferson,  you shouldn't know  how to talk to your mammy  that way.  And she's like,  mammy?  Who you calling mammy?  Shouldn't know how to talk  to your mammy that way.  Mammy.  Mother Jefferson  was a great character.  Oh, yeah.  She was such  an ice queen cunt.  Yes. 
[01:24:00]  I hated Louise.  Really well written.  I gotta get all  these old sitcoms.  Oh, yeah.  Norman Lear was good, dude.  He was a great  fucking writer  of sitcom.  Funny TV dialogue.  And capturing the time  and stuff,  it was really,  really good.  You know what you are?  Oh, he's gonna say it.  Oh, he's gonna say it.  Fucking...  You just know  what he meant.  Yeah.  It's great.  I thought he was  gonna call her...  George.  Yeah, this is great.  George.  He's gonna call her...  That's hilarious.  It really is. 
[01:24:30]  All right, listen.  When we get back,  we got the Penn State shit.  We'll get into that.  Pepsi's keeping  their sponsorship  for now.  That's good.  And we got the Penn State fan  comparing sanctions  to 9-11.  Wow, that's a bold statement.  And also,  we gotta figure out  what the fuck is happening  with the Jackson family.  I'm a bit confused  by this one.  I'll tell you one thing.  That fucking...  Paris.  Paris.  Look, she's growing  into a fine thing there.  She's 14.  Well, you could tell.  I'm not saying right now.  She's 14.  But you could tell. 
[01:25:00]  You could tell  what's gonna happen there.  She's gonna be hot as fuck.  She's still in the minor leagues, though.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, you could tell.  She's still working on her...  When you see a prospect  playing ball...  On her curveball.  You know, from the farm team?  Yeah.  You know that, all right,  when that comes up  into the majors,  it's gonna be pretty good.  There's a lot going on here.  Katherine Jackson  is basically in hiding, I think.  Janet Jackson  is slapping the shit  out of Paris.  She called her  a spoiled little bitch.  But of course she is.  Yeah.  She's being treated  as Michael Jackson's  daughter. 
[01:25:30]  Right.  If she is his daughter,  yeah, of course.  And Janet wasn't  a spoiled little bitch.  Well, she had to live  through the Joe Jackson  fist years.  And it looks like  she picked up  a thing or two  from her father  because she smacked  the shit out of her.  We'll get into it next.  Damn.  Life for prehistoric man  was not easy.  Until now,  very little has been revealed  about the existence  of Cro-Magnon man.  The concept of the chair  was still a mystery,  so posture was  a chronic problem.  Always squatting,  you're using two hands  to do something. 
[01:26:00]  That's what they would do  is always squat  with their balls  on the dirt,  like,  pounding a rock  into something  to make fire.  Communication was,  as you might imagine,  primitive,  so thoughts were  often misconstrued.  There's no internet,  you just gotta draw  a picture of a buffalo  on the wall  and you're like,  ugh,  I don't know what you mean.  Without medical knowledge  or technique,  prehistoric man relied  on less sophisticated  methods to treat ailments.  You get a toothache,  you just gotta lay there  and chew a piece  of fucking bark.  Even the simple act  of sheltering oneself  from the elements  was a daunting task 
[01:26:30]  for the Neanderthal.  Hey, it's chilly,  let's push that rock  in front of the fucking  mountainside we live in.  It's too cold to go outside,  so let's just shit  against what would be  the kitchen or the parlor.  And ferocious predators  lingered around  every corner.  Where's Ted?  I'm Ted  and I don't know  what I'm doing.  He was devoured  by something  that flew out of a tree.  Living as a caveman  really sucked,  didn't it?  Nothing to do  except survive.  Yeah.  Live.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the  O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[01:27:00]  Most motherfuckers  don't go downstairs.  It's the line  when I fucking hear  this song.  Which song is this?  Suck my kids.  Red Hot Chili Peppers.  I've been howling  ever since you were,  you left the studio  talking about 
[01:27:30]  doo-doo on a stick.  And I completely  agree with you.  It's fucking wonderful.  When you run  after somebody  with doo-doo  on a stick,  women and men  will act differently.  That was a childhood  assault weapon.  That's the assault weapon  of the child.  That was the dirty bomb.  Doo-doo on a stick  was like,  you know,  we gotta restrict  children running around  with doo-doo on a stick.  It was the weapon  to have  because everyone  scattered.  Women would just,  women,  girls,  because...  WMD. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah,  we were all just  boys and girls,  so let's...  Girls would just  run away  screaming bloody murder.  Guys would run away  but they would be howling.  That's the difference.  It's funny  to be chased  with a stick  full of shit.  I don't remember  one girl laughing  as she's being chased  by a guy  with a doo-doo  on a stick.  A doo-doo stick  is very,  very scary.  Guys would laugh  their balls off  the entire time  trying to get away  from the doo-doo  on a stick.  Because I kept  trying to,  in this dumb  Chip video, 
[01:28:30]  like,  there was a couple  of references  to doo-doo  on a stick  where Chip  would mention it  and finally  I got one out  but Sam was right.  I kept laughing.  It's too funny.  I crack up  a bunch of times  on this  and you can't see it  because we had  to edit around it  but I kept  trying to say  doo-doo on a stick  and I'm laughing.  It's hilarious  how much you're laughing  at it  because it's such  a funny thing.  The other thing,  to everybody  who's noticing  the shaky camera work,  if you're laughing  while you're watching  the video, 
[01:29:00]  what do you think  I was doing  while I was filming it?  Yeah,  you're right there.  People just  sit back  and enjoy the show,  please.  In the middle of a,  also we were,  you know,  in the middle  of a packed Comic Con  so people are  knocking into me  and I'm just  trying not to giggle.  That's why the best  cameramen are the ones  with just no sense  of humor,  no nothing.  They don't give a shit  about what's filming.  Keep it in frame,  keep it steady.  They're not laughing  at anything.  Chip would be a good  camera.  Where can we see  these videos there,  Sam?  Well,  it's on Chippa TV's  official YouTube channel  which is Chippa TV show. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah,  but you got to spell  Chippa TV,  right?  We'll just go to  YouTube slash  Chippa TV show,  yeah.  Chippa TV show  on YouTube.  Yeah,  that's where all  the Chippa TV videos are.  Nice,  and of course  it's on our  Facebook page.  Yes.  Very good.  I want to thank  Times Square Dave.  We're talking about  Olympic athletes,  Anthony.  The Olympics are  a mere two days away.  Yeah,  so we're paying tribute  I guess to some  of the athletes.  I heard about this girl  that dances before  she runs hurdles.  It's a viral video,  but I didn't click on it  for whatever reason. 
[01:30:00]  And Times Square Dave  just tweeted  the girl that dances  before she runs hurdles.  This fucking thing rules.  Yeah,  let me see.  You got it there.  Yeah,  here we go.  Punch it up there.  Let's see what she does.  Oh,  fuck,  what's she doing?  This is her routine.  That's slow motion.  She dances and wiggles  her hips before  she runs her races.  And then she jumps  up and down.  What's she doing?  And that's sexy. 
[01:30:30]  How sexy is that?  Wow.  I like that.  Michelle Jenke  from Australia.  I love a girl  that knows how to move.  Holy fuck.  Or Austria.  Where is she from?  This is her thing.  I don't know what  that's an abbreviation for.  She's beautiful, man.  Does she have a chance  to win a medal?  A little tattoo.  She's fucking hot, man.  And look,  she just jumps up  and down.  She has a smile  on her face.  She has restless  light syndrome. 
[01:31:00]  Look at her.  This video should have  200 million views.  I dig this one.  Yeah.  Yay!  Yay!  Dancing!  And she does  a little hand thing.  Oh, man.  How she loosens up,  I guess.  The big clits  being flopped  all over those undershorts.  But she does it  with a smile  on her face.  Wow,  what a pair  of legs on her.  Yeah,  like a gazelle.  They'll watch the gun  get shot  and they all run  and she just falls  on her dumb face. 
[01:31:30]  Let's see her run.  I hope she loses.  Oh, man.  Michelle Janek.  Janek.  Janek.  I'm going to be  looking at her  at this Olympics.  J-E-N-N-E-K-E.  I would hate that.  And go.  Why aren't they running?  The judge is getting  behind the stairs.  He wants to stare  at the ass for a while.  There she is.  She's the third one in.  Yay!  Yay!  Look at her go!  Jump!  Jump!  Look at her go!  She's sexy  and can run?  Fuck yeah.  Damn! 
[01:32:00]  So she might medal.  You couldn't even  fucking nail her on a date  because she'd just run away.  And then she's just  smiling again.  Who's she waving at?  And then she bounces  up and down again.  Oh, what a cute little  fucking fat look.  Oh, yeah.  You see the tan lines?  She's fucking amazing.  I like this.  I have no shot with her.  Times Square Dave  is my best friend today.  Dude, her fucking ass  is perfect.  You should get a lot  of followers for this.  You know how tight  that ass is from running  and doing hurdles?  I hope there's something 
[01:32:30]  wrong with like a giant  roid from running  that she scrapes it  on the fucking top  of the thing.  Look at it.  It's all perched up  and out.  Look at that guy behind.  Look at the guy  looking at the asses.  He's holding his cock.  He's holding his dick down.  Damn, look at her go.  God damn it.  Oh, man.  That's...  She's really good.  That's like a horse.  Oh, look at her pussy  ligament.  Oh, my God.  Look at those legs, man.  I'd bite it  like a corn cob.  That's like a fucking  thoroughbred.  Yeah.  I want to see her  wiggling the hips  before she runs again.  My ass was wiggling, too. 
[01:33:00]  Thank you, nice lady.  I just want to see her  ass at the end  when she pulls her shorts  out of her fucking dumper.  Yeah.  I would fucking  put it in my mouth.  I'd suck on her shorts  like I was trying to  like blow up a balloon  in your mouth.  One of those party balloons.  That's a great smile.  And she's holding  her bees down.  Her full bees.  Let me tell you,  she has a fucking  real future in endorsements  if she just gets any medal.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, that little dance.  Oh, my God.  That little dance she does.  I heard about this video.  It is big time viral. 
[01:33:30]  We're a little behind  on this one.  Oh, are we?  God damn it.  We're always behind  on the viral ones.  Oh, sugar.  A little bit on this one.  Oh, sugar.  Let me see a still pic of her  up in the, uh,  some close up on her face.  No, down.  Down, you fucking lunk.  Down on the face one,  you fucking cocksucker.  All right, there's something  a little weird going on there.  Wow.  No.  Goofy Tina.  Oh, how old is she?  Goofy.  Nah, she looks a lot younger there.  Yeah.  I think she grew into her looks  or something.  Get another one.  Sam, another one.  Another still pic.  The boss wants another one.  Come on, Sam. 
[01:34:00]  What's the matter?  Yeah, find a good one.  Who is this bitch?  The one you went for it first.  Yeah, or...  All right.  There's some schnozzola problem,  but...  Oh, I don't know.  Let's go down.  She doesn't have a fucking fat...  It's very wide.  God damn it, Ann.  She has a big...  Very wide.  But you know what?  I wonder if that's why  she's so fucking quick  because she breathes  through that big nose.  Because she can breathe in  through that?  Yeah.  What are you trying to say?  Jimmy the Greek?  No.  Hey.  Black people are usually  faster running.  They probably breathe  much easier than a larger nose.  She has a larger nose.  She's white.  Let's see.  I don't know.  Now we're knocking her down.  No, that dance makes up for it.  I think it's all about 
[01:34:30]  the wiggling.  When you start wiggling,  it makes you hotter.  And her smile.  She has a nice smile.  And her smile.  Because now you see  still pictures not so hot.  Ah, she's pretty, man.  All right.  That's good.  Big wide nose.  I'll just smell my bag.  It smells like onions.  What is that?  It's her Australian accent.  Oh, you smell like onions, eh?  Everything turns into Jamaican.  Yeah.  She would know when I came home.  Like, literally,  I'd walk in the door.  With the chase of the actual accent.  She'd be across the room going,  It smells like you've got onions in there, eh? 
[01:35:00]  Were you shopping in an onion shop?  No, Michelle.  That's hilarious.  I was on the bus for a long time.  Would it be a treat for her  to smell your bag?  It actually would be my bag.  She's 19.  That's perfect.  My bag is not very clean.  She's wonderful.  You got a wide nose?  Her nose is a little wide?  What the fuck's that from?  I don't know.  Yeah.  Hey, I tweeted a Mike Tyson song last night.  And some people say we played it already.  We might have. 
[01:35:30]  It was really brilliant, though.  I don't know.  I don't remember playing this one.  Mike Tyson quotes in song.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  It's very, very funny.  Ooh.  And it made me watch Mike Tyson clips after  and then just love him all over again.  Yeah, he was.  I love Mike Tyson.  And then someone named Pretty Plus More on Twitter.  We did a little back and forth last night.  She goes, she's a huge fan of Mike Tyson.  You probably know all this, but it's great background. 
[01:36:00]  Tyson, I did not know this, and I want to ask Jimmy.  Tyson supposedly refused to shower in prison  because he was so shocked to see men's collapsed rectums in prison.  What?  Tyson's a fucking...  Rumor is no guard was brave enough to make him shower  for the entire duration of his stay.  Wait, wait.  He wasn't afraid of getting fucked, was he?  No.  He was...  Stop it.  Unless he has a tiny cock.  Supposedly he saw men's collapsed rectums, 
[01:36:30]  and that prevented him from showering.  No.  I don't believe that at all.  I'm not buying that one.  We're going to have him on the show, right?  I would love to have him on the show.  Yeah.  What?  We said yes to him.  Oh, yeah.  Of course we did, yeah.  Oh, you don't think we're going to have him?  When those pitches come around, like,  Would you like President Obama?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fuck, I believed that one.  I thought we were really going to have him.  Maybe we will.  It's Ed Rolland.  I love Mike Tyson.  Yeah, well, Mike Tyson quotes the song.  I like this a lot. 
[01:37:00]  Hit that.  Because you can read it.  If you watch it online, too,  you can see the quotes written out.  It's very funny.  Right.  That's a guitar.  That's a guitar.  Yeah.  Everyone has a plan  Till they get punched  In the mouth  I'm a historian  And that freaks me out  I'm a nutcase, but that is what I believe 
[01:37:30]  I'm just happy I'm not a phony  I just want to conquer people and their souls  I'll eat your ass or love you, bitch  Fuck you, you hoe  I'm on the soul  I'm on the soul  To keep  From killing y'all

[01:38:30]  You can't last two minutes  In my world, bitch  And a bully road  I love things  To Carlin  Carlin  I wanna rip out his heart  And feed it to him  I wanna kill people  I wanna rip out their stomachs  And eat their children  I'm on the soul  To keep 
[01:39:00]  From killing y'all  I guess I'll fade into Bolivia  When you see me smash someone's skull  You enjoy it  I'm on the soul  To keep  From killing y'all  I guess I'll fade into Bolivia  When you see me smash someone's skull 
[01:39:30]  You enjoy it  I love that  And how true is that, too  When you see me smash someone's skull  You enjoy it  Yeah, of course  That fucking  Everyone has a plan  Until they get punched in the mouth  Punched in the mouth  Is an amazing fucking line  One of the greatest things ever said  Dude, by apology  It's up there with anything JFK  Or Martin Luther King said  Everyone has a plan 
[01:40:00]  Until they get punched in the mouth  True dat  Remember the hurdler  We were just talking about  The hurdler, yes  My boy's at the stall seat on Twitter  Unfortunately, she did not make the Olympics  What?  Shouldn't she be in just for doing that?  Oh, man  Why do they take it so seriously?  I'm going to dance on my face with her anus  She's wiggling and jumping up and down  And smiling like that  They should just go  Yeah, you know what?  You're in  You're in  We're going to have to  Keep paying attention to the volleyball girls then  Oh, well  We're back to volleyball girls then  Back to volleyball

[01:41:00]  Who makes the wrong point  You guys hate when sponsors are bullied  Absolutely  When it's a language issue  Or somebody's offended  I hate when they go after the sponsors  It really is intimidation  I hate it  I don't know  There's just something about the  Biggest child fucking scandal  In the history of sports  And it was covered up  That's a little different  Yeah  Than a guy doing a rape joke  Or a child molesting joke 
[01:41:30]  Or a racial joke  And Pepsi has dropped sponsorships before  Yep  Well that's, uh, that's the problem I got  It's hypocritical  Because, uh, they dropped sponsorship  Of, uh, a horse show  After video of animal abuse  Mm  Right, in May  In May  Two months ago  Two months ago  Yeah, a couple months ago  And of course  The ludicrous thing  Yeah  You know, they pulled  Ludicrous  From the ads  For what reason?  Again, I forget  Because he was  Bill O'Reilly's lyrics  Right, right, right  So  They're not consistent  Yeah  That's the problem I have 
[01:42:00]  This is child fucking  Like, this is different  Than language  Or offensive  Or artistic value  Or artistic integrity  They  They covered up  The fucking  Of kids  Yes  For a long time  This shit school  For a long fucking time  I think a few of these  Sponsorships are  Dropping out too  Because the rating  Is going to be  Drastically down  They're not going to be  Competitive anytime soon  And their thing is  Well, the people  Have all been punished  To have done it  Yeah, maybe you're right  Maybe a thumb

Hey  Look at that  Hey  How does that work out?  I guess you're fucked  You're just fucked  Yeah, I don't think  Any bookie would even  Expect his money back  You mean a gambler?  Yeah, from a gambler  I mean  Because bookies also  Don't forget bookies also  Lost money betting  Against Penn State  Right  Well, that's true 
[01:43:00]  And somebody tweeted  I didn't think I was  Going to bring this up  At this moment  Or I give you credit  There's one game  Penn State played  Where officially  There's no winner  Because the other team  Also had to give up  Some shit  Oh, really?  Yeah  So there's one game  In there somewhere  Where both  No one won  No one won  Wow  You want to hear  From the Penn State kid?  Yeah, let's hear  Some of this shit  Oh, man  Did fucking A-Rod  Take a baseball  To the hand  Is that it for the air?  Broke his hand, man  Oh, wow  It fucking hit him 
[01:43:30]  Look at this  Bam  Right there  And he just  Fucking goes down  What part of the hand?  It's hard to tell  Right on the back of the hand  Oh, I know  By the pinky  Close to the pinky, right?  Yeah, close to the pinky side  He was fucking in agony  How many weeks?  Oh, and then  They headhunted a bit  Wait, that was the Yankees  Or no?  Throwing that pitch?  No, it's not the Yankees  No, no  No, Boston  Wow  Warner Wolf  Warner Wolf  Still doing it 
[01:44:00]  Nice man  But I'm telling you  When a pitcher hits somebody  Their team wants them  To throw at the other team  Yeah, yeah  Like you want to fuck around?  Okay  Yeah  Right  That's what happens  They can always tell  When it's an accident  Can't they?  Man, that fucking  How many weeks out?  I don't know  But he's got a  Legitimate broken hand  Yeah  Here's  Eight weeks out  Eight  Great  I'm going this Friday  To see the Yankee game  Yeah, well you won't be  CNA, Rod  No  Yankee socks  I made sure it was that one 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, motherfucker  I want to acknowledge  That once again  We got  Serious app  Problems  Oh my god  Because I don't want you  To think I'm ignoring you guys  I don't know what to tell you  The fuck  Every fucking day  What the fuck  They're saying it's  The same ten minutes  Yeah  Mom's for Opie  I guess it's a replay day  Because a lot of people  Like to, you know  Get the show  And listen when they want  Right  So when the app fucks up  They're like 
[01:45:00]  Alright, I guess I gotta wait  Until three o'clock  And do the whole replay thing  Yeah, wait for the replay  And then other people  Are really frustrated  Because I guess the app  Shuts off after an hour  Because they assume  You're done listening to the show  Jesus Christ  And you gotta start it up again  Or something  It's just  It's a bit buggy  Terrible  It's a bit buggy  And every time we bring it up  With the guys down the hall  They're like  It's working fine on our end  Unbelievable  And the app  That's all we hear  It's working fine on our end  Yeah, it's working fine here  Well, how about you read  My Twitter feed someday  And see all the complaints 
[01:45:30]  That come in  Pretty much on a daily basis  Apps are everything  If you don't have a good app  You need apps these days  The fact that Facebook  Has a bad app  Is absolutely an embarrassment  I don't know  Facebook's app is terrible  It stinks  It's a freezy  Fucking buggy  Everyone knows it stinks  Because I have a fan page  I can't update my Facebook  Fan page from my phone  No, it's terrible  It goes to my regular account  Which is not an account really  It's just a placeholder  It's terrible  The way they handle  The fan pages  Fucking sucks  Holy shit  And you can't just go 
[01:46:00]  Right from your Twitter  To your fan page  Like when I tweet something  I want it to go on Facebook  But you can't do that  You have to do it from Facebook  It's like  Oh, you want to be  Territorial scumbags?  Yeah  I'll ignore Facebook  I, uh, I  Yeah, I don't post as much  On Facebook  Because it's more of a pain in the ass  No, it is  I never post on Facebook  Never  They're the worst  I do, but not as much  Um, here's the Penn State fan  Tiny  One look around Tom and Sally Price's home  In Factoryville  And you know  They are Penn State proud 
[01:46:30]  Tom Price is a Penn State grad  And both are diehard football fans  They've been to almost every home game  Since 1986  They watched the news of the sanctions  Against their school  With heavy hearts  I can't put my arms around it  It's  It was  To me  It was our 9-11 today  You know  Holy shit  Get a hold of yourself  Come on, dude  Get a hold of yourself  Come on  Well, he's right  If you consider Jerry Sandusky's penis a plane  And those 10-year-old boy assholes  The towers 
[01:47:00]  And the fucking plane  The only difference is  Stupid  On 9-11  The plane didn't back out  And then fly in again  Right  Fucking dummy  What a dumb football fan  Unfortunately, your college is tainted  Sucks to be you, you know  You know, when I tell people  I went to Geneseo State University  They go  Whoa  Wow, that's a really tough school to get into  No one said that, have they?  It's  It's  They call it the Ivy League  Of the SUNY system  All the shit  But my point is this  When I did go there 
[01:47:30]  Yeah  It was a shitty drinking school  Yeah  See, I luck out now  You look like the hero  Yeah, I look like I'm a fucking, you know  Scholar  Scholar  A scholar  But as far as the Penn State shit goes  You had this nice university  And guess what?  It's tainted  Now it's tainted  You lose  You lose, I win  And that's what you get for associating yourself with a college  Like this guy  Right  If you're so married to where you went to  Who gives a fuck?  Who gives a fuck?  Oh, and by the way  You get a flag  By the way, I'm not married to 
[01:48:00]  You know, that I went to Genesee  Whatever  It is what it is  You know  Although  I hate it  I love that  Go home team  Referee whistle  The school song  We hear a blue  And a Penn State  There it is  Yes, ladies and gentlemen 
[01:48:30]  Here we are  At Penn State University  Here comes the football team  Out on the field  Give them a big cheer  There's Jerry Sandusky  Pugging a young boy in the ass in the shower  Look at the blood running down his thighs  And there's Joe Paterno  Holding his sheet up in front of him  Going, nothing to see here, folks  Why is he wearing horse blinders?  But don't take down the statue  Should be a big day for football today, folks  Oh, boy  Yeah, the pride thing  Oh, stop it 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, I hate  I fucking hate alma maters  The fact that you've got to go back to where you went to school  How about all your fathers?  Oh, fuck it  How do I get any work done in this fucking cookie house?  That's because you didn't go to college, though  I kind of like it  I don't obsess about it  But it's kind of cool  I didn't go to college  But  No, because I don't know if you could relate to it  No, I'm not taking a shot  No, I know you're not  You just come from a different place  You might be right  As far as this goes  School of Hard Knocks  I have no allegiance to a college 
[01:49:30]  So if I went, maybe I would feel like  Yeah, no, I get that connection  Because for a lot of people, it's a huge coming of age  Like, it means more than I'm giving it credit for  Yeah  But I hate the obsession people have with it  Like, the guys that have to be involved with everything the school does  And they, you know, they want to say what the school is  It's like, well, just get on with your life  Those are the creepy people  Yeah  Being involved  You know, you go back to some of these things  And you see the 60-year-old with the fraternity shirt on  You're like, huh, okay  It's a little 
[01:50:00]  Like, I'm too old now to go back  I hate that  And what the school song is always  We're the Nittany Lions  And we will always be true  Whatever the dumb song is  Whatever the dumb songs are  It's about pride and how you never forget the  Because if you come to Penn State  You're going to lose the game  You  Shut up  Really?  Yeah  Well, treat your hiney like a pincushion 
[01:50:30]  If you're a little fella  And now since the sanctions  It is kickoff  He's running the wrong way  He doesn't even know how to play the game  What a team they have now this year  I feel bad  I mean, your university is extremely tainted  They should change the name of the place  At this point  It's bad  It's going to be bad for a long time  And then this asshole comparing it to 9-11  9-11  Or 9-11 today 
[01:51:00]  You know, I just saw planes crashing into towers  Sally Price feels the same  She says what hurts most  Is the fact that the NCAA  Took away 14 years of football victories  Under Joe Paterno  It had nothing to do with the Sandusky scandal  They played hard  They worked hard for those victories  And to take them away  We will always feel that he's the NCAA victory leader  It's like the Titanic  And the Hindenburg all wrapped into one  Oh my god 
[01:51:30]  It's like that school that the Chechnians  Fucking blew up with the children in it  Oh my goodness  This reminds me of the Nazis going house to house  And they're weeding out victories  Right now the NCAA is having a cold glass of milk  While they shoot Joe Paterno's victories underneath the house  This is the same thing  Six million points wiped out  And we're going to hunt down the people  The boys whose little heinies are responsible for this  This is absolutely football's version of Hiroshima 
[01:52:00]  I feel that the team  You could literally see the team members' images burnt into the field  Where they were just incinerated  It's  Yeah  Fuck this  Fucking overdramatic bullshit  The bottom line is  They wiped out all those victories  Think about it  What does it mean?  You just don't feel like a winner anymore  No  It means nothing  And again  Hope said it yesterday  That's because that would have affected people's decision 
[01:52:30]  Yeah  To go to that school  And the NCAA was saying  You know what?  Here's your wins  They're gone  It makes complete sense now  Yes  Because the Paterno talked back in the day  Yeah  Potential recruits would have went somewhere else  And all that shit  He was a twat who cared more about his own legacy  And football  Than he did fucking kids getting fucked in the ass  It's just mind-boggling  How that whole fucking university  Like the upper echelon people 
[01:53:00]  Yeah  Behave like just pigs  I guess when you're from Factoryville, Pennsylvania  Yeah  It's a big thing  I get that  To have Penn State  Fight on state  Fight on state  Strike your gate and win  Da-da-da-da-da  Victory we predict for thee  Ugh  We're ever true to you, dear  Old, white, and blue  Onward state  Onward state  Roar, lions, roar 
[01:53:30]  We'll hit that line  Roll up the score  Fight on to victory evermore  Fight on  Fight on  On  On  On  On  Fight on  On  On  Penn State  State  Oh, fuck yourself  How does it sound when they sing it?  Oh  Yeah  Da-da-da-da  Yeah  Da-da-da-da  Yeah  Oh  Oh  Thanks 
[01:54:00]  And win  Victory  We predict for thee  Ugh  Wherever  True to you, dear  And our coach  Is a queer  Finger in the air  Sticking in a boy's hiney  And we'll cry when the victories are taken away  Because it's a reflection on us  Here in Zilksville  Ah  Yes  Ah  Yeah  Points 
[01:54:30]  We will gain  While blood runs down the drain  And the boy's hiney  Is in pain  What the fuck are we insane?  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha 
[01:55:00]  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha  Ha 
[01:55:30]  Ha  Ha  Ha  Hey, guys.  So I understand the whole reasoning behind bashing Sandus.  I went to Penn State for four years, graduated last year.  Of course.  Yeah, the university's now tainted.  That's got to suck.  Yes, sir.  But?  Taint.  You know, it does suck a bit, but the thing that sucks more is the grouping and the basic  bashing you guys are doing to the university as a whole now.  I didn't have any hand in that, but...  Hand?  We're not bashing the students.  Just to interrupt you, we're not bashing the student body, the athletes. 
[01:56:00]  But it wasn't just Sandusky.  It was the head coach who kind of represented the university, who was beloved, and it was  also the president.  It was all these higher-ups.  Turned the figurehead of Penn State.  Yes.  It was a lot more than just one guy, dude.  Right.  Right.  But what's bullshit is...  It's a team effort.  Huh?  I understand.  I understand.  That means you don't understand, so I want you to just say what you need to say.  Can I explain?  You go ahead.  Explain, sir.  Yes.  Thank you.  Yes, go ahead.  Explain.  Spock, explain.  So, from the top, there were definitely some issues, but when media outlets like yourself... 
[01:56:30]  See, that's downplaying it.  Some issues.  Some little issues.  Yeah, they did kind of...  Dude, they ignored...  Major issues.  Childfucking.  A lot of major issues.  Not just some issues.  I'm not done explaining.  Oh.  But you...  But in a way, we have to jump in.  When you said there are some issues up at the top...  Like, you just pushed that aside.  Right there.  We're not...  That's not accurate.  It's like the mayor of Amity.  Some bathers were injured.  Right.  Exactly.  Those boys' assholes look like the Kinder Boy. 
[01:57:00]  It's called downplaying it, sir.  Yeah.  I was kind of being sarcastic, but I'm sorry.  There were a lot of issues.  Okay.  All right.  We'd like that.  The point I'm trying to get at is media outlets, like yourselves, pulling these clips from  fucking the loonies, saying about how basically the whole Sandusky issue was our 9-11.  He doesn't speak for me.  He doesn't speak for the 50,000...  Excuse me.  No.  We never said that.  Hey, Tim.  Tim, I think everyone knows that.  We found this clip, and we think he's an idiot. 
[01:57:30]  Exactly.  Just because you have...  We don't think the whole Penn State thinks this way.  Well, I don't think so, because you were just sitting there, singing the fight song that  the whole song...  Ah, because we're trying to make some jokes.  Fight song.  The fight song.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  My hiney hurts.  Quiet, kid.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Can't hear the child's cries.  Over 100,000 people yelling field goal.  Yelling field goal.  Fight on state. 
[01:58:00]  Fight on state.  While I masturbate.  Fight on state.  Boy, this kid's ass feels great.  that's what i'm talking about come on come on well get used to it because we're not gonna  i want to congratulate tim for buying another 20 minutes of this yes  and tim comes in his pants whenever he thinks of victories  you know i'm all for a joke i'm all for no you're not that means you're not shut the fuck up tim 
[01:58:30]  but you're all for a joke but let's get to the brass tacks here right yeah what's that tim we've  had enough we've already gotten our shit kicked in 20 times oh you should have got your children  you need it for 13 more years you're gonna get it how many years ago did you graduate  a year ago all right it's still fresh for you yeah you still feel penn state pride  okay well correct this how does the fight song go i've never heard it what is how what is the i  mean if you're if you really have loyalty how does it go i'm not giving you any kind of material so 
[01:59:00]  oh no you don't know oh you don't even give a shit you don't know the fucking your song fight  songs suck he doesn't know it's not special yeah where's your where's your pride yeah man where's  your pride man have some pride have some pride tim put on your nittany lion are you wearing the  colors today yeah look i'm gonna i'm gonna hang up oh tell you is if you could move on for maybe  some of the nope nope nope what is dave douglas half hour on nope oh we're going into a dangerous 
[01:59:30]  area paternal and children and what you're saying right now makes me more convinced yeah that i'm  right to bash that shitty place yes and anything anybody's ever said congratulations you had pride in  your in your university it's now drastically tainted i don't know how you deal with that but  we've taken enough like again look at this self-obsession we've taken it's not about you 
[02:00:00]  anything hangs up oh you said you said you were going to you said i'm gonna hang up now you haven't  taken anything what have you taken yeah you get a dick stuck in your ass the kids took a lot  look at the end of the day at the end of the day you went to university where there was a massive  kid fucking exactly at the end of the day that's what you got to deal with that's right and it  probably sucks but i would i would go to uh kinko's and update your resume and yeah exactly maybe like  kind of make it say blank state gloss over that i graduated from blank state or move the letters 
[02:00:30]  closer so you went to pence pence where's pence right oh yeah fight song oh here comes the lion  everyone's dressed like a lion where's the song on the other side oh good yeah  fight fight fight fight fight state fight fight fight mrs sandusky didn't see a thing 
[02:01:00]  as i plowed it in his leather ring oh oh it sounds like when he screams it sounds like a sing  as he wraps his tight hiney around my tingling oh yeah that's a good one thank you uh  steve for bay shark ah come come come in the young lads come come come don't you feel glad 
[02:01:30]  come come come come this boy's tiny is rad  hit him again hit him again deeper deeper  fight fight fight but it won't help because i'm older and the floor is slippery from the  sun  uh tim like that dick block that  tim hung up oh come on sweetie boy hey it's gotta shut up tim it's gotta suck yeah too bad 
[02:02:00]  fuck him i'm not the kid fucker sorry sorry supporting the kid fucking institution yeah i'm  sorry i'm not the one that cried about the statue your fucking university handled it terribly don't take the  statue down uh jopa oh boy we got the penn state guys calling oh no here we go scott welcome aboard  welcome aboard scott thank you i mean listen a lot of these penn state guys that are calling up are 
[02:02:30]  idiots i uh listen i uh i'm a huge fan of you guys but oh the penalties that were enforced  are bullshit really they can take the wins away they can take all the wins they can take the statue  down joe paterno fucked up bad uh schultz spanier they all deserve the writing they covered up  what about curly psychopath yeah yeah all of these the rest of these penalties are penalizing innocent  people none of these students none of these players are for the next four years the next eight 
[02:03:00]  years did anything wrong when i signed up for penn state they didn't tell me listen are you on board  with child fucking because if you are this is the place for you if you're not don't come here  all right so what should they have done what should they have done they should have penalized the  individuals they this is not a football issue it's a criminal issue right deserve to rot in jail so  but the culture let me ask you something the culture in that school and this is what the ncaa  president said is it's a win at all costs thing and you're saying just penalize the individuals fair 
[02:03:30]  enough but those guys represented the school paterno represented that school in a very very big way  and it wasn't just one it was a collection of people in charge that fucking covered it up  it wasn't one guy it wasn't one guy you're absolutely right kim i you know i read most of  the free report it was five guys who are criminally should be criminally indicted i mean paterno's  dead granted but five guys you're kidding how did it happen oh god love them and you know what the 
[02:04:00]  school dude is going to take a black eye because i'll tell you what you know what what's interesting  what you're saying right now is it's a criminal issue they shouldn't punish the school but when  the school has so many good things come to it because of football this nobody at the school ever  says hey hey we don't want all this stuff it's only the football team you as a school accept all of  the praise and all of the great things brought on by the sports program and and and and the uh the  influx of great students you get and the influx of great players and great attention and great 
[02:04:30]  coverage and great donations all of that stuff benefits the entire school coming from the football  program so now something bad happens to the program and you're like hey how can that hurt us  that's football do you see what i'm saying like that's fair but the one thing i have a problem with is  this win at all costs that they're that they're bashing that that's every football program in the  country yeah but until another until it comes out that another university is having a kid fucking 
[02:05:00]  yeah that'll never happen of course this one this was way over the top as far as that culture goes  this dude this is a big this is a big this is not steroid this is all i think you're completely wrong  by the way it's a tough spot but i don't know what else they were supposed to do i feel bad for some  these athletes because they agreed to go to penn state before i guess all this hit and now they're  kind of fucked as far as their athletic careers go some of them will survive it but others are  going to are going to get fucked through this you know what he's saying he's saying schools don't  fuck children people fuck children i understand completely sir graham nash looks great now and by 
[02:05:30]  and you're lucky to do that they didn't actually just take the football program they what they're  doing is they're they're throwing a one year 60 millions what penn state football makes in a year  oh that's what the 60 million comes from yeah one year revenue and four years of no bowls  they're not doing a fucking oh jimmy i'm going to challenge you on that the 60 i mean the four  years it's going to be it's going to take a while after that to rebuild the program as 60 million is  going to drastically drop for the next few years as well but this is not going to hurt penn state 
[02:06:00]  overall in the long run it's going to be it wasn't a death sentence but they're putting them in a  tough spot where they're going to have they're going to have to do a lot to come back from this they  pushed all of this into paterno's coffin right i'm telling you that's what taking these wins away  was joe's dead so they're like fuck them take the statue down fuck them right shovel it all on  yeah but joe only fuck them shut up he's dead fuck them but he was the winner well he's not anymore  fuck them because that coffin full of blame this is the they're shoveling all of this into paterno's 
[02:06:30]  coffin sandusky's gone to jail and a lot of the wrath that would have been brought down on the  university is being shoveled into paterno's coffin yes because you think it tasks me i don't mind it  to the point they're doing it i mean i don't mind it because it's a fucking knife in the psyche of  the university so i don't mind it as much right but that's the thing it's not the psyche of the  university this was five assholes who took football too seriously if you ask anyone else 
[02:07:00]  affiliated with the program do you want to cover up child you know child raping and sandusky  everyone else would have said no no i i understand that i would love to know part of the psyche of  the university there's a lot more people that knew too by the way that will skate it was a power  grab by the ncaa for a big you know what were they supposed to do there i disagree about they  got to do something it's in their interest something take away the wind absolutely the  sixty million dollars yeah that's a drop in the you know the ocean of money that they make 
[02:07:30]  and granted they should have donated that that money to charity that's great i have no problem  with that at all but to say for the next 10 years we're killing this program because of actions of  individuals who are no longer going to be affiliated with the program is crazy i i i don't  necessarily disagree totally with this guy you think a four-year penalty is a big deal  considering the well because everyone on the football team right now has nothing to do with  this scandal whatsoever sure so but it's a tough spot i mean you're punishing the students in a way 
[02:08:00]  but again you're big time punishing those students these college kids love their football programs man  then they'll have to they'll have to reach out of it middle class or lower middle class working  money money the money funds academics the money funds everything else and it's all tuition that  that pays for all of that and now they're taking like six million dollars sure that's no big deal  but all of this money that that is generated by football and bowl games gets funneled into  everything else at the university i understand what you're saying but then you wonder what the 
[02:08:30]  could they have done though they they had to make a state they did have to make a major statement i  think they did the right thing and i wouldn't care if they kept him out of bowl games for 10 years  they covered up kid fucking for 13 years they fucking allowed this guy to come onto that campus  and use their facility and they knew because i'm saying the penalty wrong is wrong it does not mean  i'm defending fantastic no i know are the athletes allowed to redshirt what's that mean take a year 
[02:09:00]  off and and and you could you know you could play they can all drop out huh what what's got  they can leave they can redshirt but i mean it's still the penn state program's dead no i i understand  that and win a game i just i i i i feel for the athletes that had nothing to do with this so i'm  wondering if if if they at least redshirt then they got a year to try to figure out where they  can play and they can they can go to the school will play immediately and they'll they'll have  starting uh you know they'll be in the starting lineup for another college but better than red  underwear kids they get it bleeding assholes they'll stay they're going to leave they're going to 
[02:09:30]  stay and they're going to be terrible and they're going to get hurt by it but they're going to  stay because that community is so strong the culture there believe it or not as much as we've  been getting fast the culture is good besides these five guys the culture there is academics  first we're the number one graduation rate for athletes our students care about football but we  also raise 10 12 million dollars a year for childhood cancer the biggest student run plan  why would you want children to get cancer exactly that's not nice fucking terrible instead of raising 
[02:10:00]  money for childhood cancer why don't you weed out the one that was running through the locker room  with a fucking heart on that tumor and don't say tumor between his legs he gets a bunch of kids  anal cancer with his tumorous dick and don't say that the culture there is good if the culture  there was good the townspeople would have come in and ripped that statue down themselves after that  fucking report came out ripping that statue down all right i would love to know how many people knew  about this how many alumni knew about this i think there's gonna be a lot of people that skate 
[02:10:30]  um yeah a lot of people probably upset with our take on it but it shows me literally the fact that  they instead of just being grateful that they didn't fucking death penalty your football program  and say go fuck you the fact that everyone at penn state just be grateful they didn't murder your  football program it's pretty bad jerry they found it's no this is a meaningless penalty in 20 years  it's one of those things that they'll look back on it'll be a big black mark but the university will  survive and thrive and this will be a blip on their radar someday as time goes on it'll be a blip on 
[02:11:00]  the radar but they make sure it never happens again by doing all this right it's an example  for every other school that no nothing like this will ever be tolerated again and let me tell you  something if it can happen to penn state it can happen to any school as far as that penalty you're  lucky they didn't kill your program all you should be going is wow glad they didn't fucking  completely ax it but jim the death penalty would have been a five-year recovery this is an eight to  ten-year recovery the death penalty wouldn't have been as bad it really wouldn't it's gonna be a 
[02:11:30]  long time it's gonna be a long time before you guys are competitive criminal charges this will  never happen again good individuals at other schools will see what happens to these guys and  it won't ever happen again because they'll be individually afraid of what's gonna happen  that they'll be found culpable i know you love your school but um i'm happy with they did  i hate these guys though and i hate fantastic i know okay all right listen i gotta give someone  else a chance here please thank you man someone's saying they're not screwing the football players  that's dan in virginia i'll go to you next but first brendan in philly wants to defend paterno 
[02:12:00]  go ahead brendan she does yeah all right so i'll go ahead and get my ears kicked in here but  let me wait where you guys getting all this information that paterno covered this up right  i'll tell you where the lou i'll tell you louis free uh who ran the fbi his report yeah okay  so louis free who ran the fbi when they burned down waco and yeah okay oh boy but again so we'll go  ahead get that the university dude you're talking apples and kid the university accepted the 
[02:12:30]  punishment they accepted the report your university accepted it dummy  i i know they accept so then what are you asking me a dick joe comic for your university accepted  the findings so does that make it true yes it does hold on the the x the louis free's investigation  showed this they have the emails the university said yes it's true we accept it and he's going 
[02:13:00]  does that make it he makes a good point it doesn't necessarily make it true it does make it  true no i don't think it's fun isn't it jim but oh i don't please yes it is no you're right it's a  riot no no he's actually right because jim norton didn't read the report it's not so good point  all right i think we're done with you brendan sorry we're done with you buddy we're done with you  that's just nonsense that's silly dan in virginia blindly defending these freaking idiots go ahead 
[02:13:30]  dan hey buddy uh the uh the free report penn state hired free to do that report so it's their report  the first that's for brandon okay second of all they didn't screw the kids at penn state because  usually if you transfer from one school to another you have to sit out of here so like if you're going  to michigan i'm not playing here i'm going to play at michigan state then you got to sit out  here right that sucks but they allowed these kids that they said look if you want to leave  you can go to another school without telling me you won't have to sit out and the school that takes 
[02:14:00]  you you will not count towards their scholarship limit so yeah no i understand all that they try  to take care of the athletes but the problem is some of these guys aren't going to find a good spot  because all the other you know competitive football programs already got their already got  their players they do but penn state has good fucking players man i mean some will definitely you  know do more than all right but i'm you know those kind of not average but you know what i mean not  the star guys that those other guys are kind of all right i get you but those guys who maybe aren't 
[02:14:30]  playing at penn state i would rather play for say northwestern than play for buttfuck you  right so they might be okay doing that and look at how there's a lot of guys in the nfl that come from  small schools i mean i'm a cowboy fan like jimmy look at demarcus where he went to troy  well who the hell knows where troy is and then for anybody who says that this is worse than the  death penalty and that's the death penalty you can recover from smu just now went to a ball game this 
[02:15:00]  year that's what 20 years ago what happened with smu smu had all kinds of recruiting violations back  in the 80s they uh paid players to come there back in the you know where they were playing texas texas a  nm texas tech all those texas schools and they they had got off of recruiting violations so the  ncaa came in and said that basically this is a crooked place i mean they got busted two or three  times so they gave them the death penalty and said you're not going to have football for two years  when you do come back you're not going to be on tv for one year and it just killed it at least these 
[02:15:30]  guys and and how many i i i don't know college football that well so how many years did it affect  them in the end oh smu that happened in the early 80s mid 80s and they're just now into a ball game  so what's that 24 years there you go good good fair enough so that their first bowl game in about 25  years wow right wow yeah see that's basically what's going to happen at penn state it's going  to be a real long time maybe uh yeah maybe not 25 years but well i would say at least i would say 10 
[02:16:00]  then let's see all that penn state loyalty like all these people now all the alma mater all the people  that were loyal let's let them can why would the funds stop if people are being loyal to the  university like all these people that were loyal go ahead uh what's that chip in and um and that's a  uh yeah the fucking uh all right dan preemptive chip thank you i want to go to an alumni who's kind  of pissed off at all the other alumni and they're about alum jays jimmy in jersey i'm right here when  did you graduate from penn state jimmy uh i was there from 98 to 2002 so i was there 
[02:16:30]  the last couple years of sandusky's career and um yeah lucky boy  it's kind of weird knowing that you know you're walking by the football building you know when i'm  looking back and knowing that that disgusting stuff was going on when you were like right outside  um but um i basically can i'm just so annoyed at my fellow alumni and the football fans at how 
[02:17:00]  they've reacted from november on it's basically the joe paternal apologists are like more like  branch davidians than they are of nitty lions that's how i describe them as or that they belong in  jonestown not state college oh man yeah cult you're disgusted by uh the alumni just being pretty much blind  yes exactly and maybe because i grew up in jersey i didn't grow up a penn state fan even though i mean  i'm a huge sports fan i didn't swallow the kool-aid but it's just it's disgusting that they're defending 
[02:17:30]  this i mean i it's really embarrassing and i mean i know you guys and other people you know are bashing  it and i know that what's worse is um on the facebook wall for the penn state alumni people  are talking about like a class action lawsuit against the ncaa and i'm like for what i think  the ncaa it didn't damage our degrees it damaged football programs like no company isn't gonna hire 
[02:18:00]  you because of this so but they're just so blinded by this i mean i'm stuttering here but it's just  disgusting we are that people nervous little nelly but doesn't that show you that the culture of  like that that shows you that the like they should all be grateful like wow hey look at least they  didn't completely discontinue football but they're not saying wow this is bigger than stupid football  this is despicable what happened we need to rethink the way we look at this shit but uh oh yeah i mean 
[02:18:30]  a lot of these people were like we'd rather have had the death penalty for four years than had joe's  statue taken down or the dummies penalty then um you don't have his wins taken away i think you're  not looking at the bigger picture and it even goes back to when the uh board of trustees fired joe in  november they were all up in arms and only the board did what they were supposed to do protect 
[02:19:00]  the university they protected it would have been a pr nightmare to have him still on the field  they had to protect the validity of our degrees the ability to attract you know top shelf uh  instructors and the ability to uh bring grants to the school for research purposes it's so much bigger  than a football program but there's so many people and they're so vocal about it that think  oh it's just you know defend paterno defend paterno and it's like god spot you know um find some 
[02:19:30]  perspective here you know these kids were abused and they turned a blind eye it's and i love the  idea of uh the paternal family coming up with you know their own investigation you know the oj finding  the real killers kind of oh yeah how'd that work out by the way yeah exactly i don't fault the family  though just for being in denial it's like yeah of course everything they've ever known since november  in six months their entire existence has changed joe is dead the the they were legendary in that 
[02:20:00]  they were they were untouchable in that town they were gods and now they're just they're outcasts  like what a weird thing i almost feel bad for his family i can understand that but then i i mean from  the family's perspective yes but from other people's perspective that are defending the family  it's like they've already said they disagree with the report so they're going to have their own  investigation well they've already admitted that their investigation is going to find the 
[02:20:30]  opposite this guy's making me snooze all right all right shut up and how come mr webb will not come  on and debate me all right thanks thank you and then you got uh people saying that the ncaa didn't do  enough so there you go it's all over the place yeah yeah i think it's uh all fair we're all  having fun what we're all having fun what happened what do you mean the whole topic got really serious  i'm still having fun it was all fun i live for fun all fun and games i was just pontificating he was 
[02:21:00]  he was saying a lot of things i didn't listen it was in one ear out there yeah i don't know a word  you said sir it really was he wasn't very dynamic i'll meet him one time remember i caught no no  not a memory at all of you up next we're going to point and laugh at al pacino's uh yeah  this is the opiate anthony channel  on sirius xm show me

[02:49:00]  most people believe it  but there are a couple noticing  severe amounts of jump cuts  no actual footage of crap coming out of a bird  or any birds  near anyone getting crapped on  right  it's real  fake  the birds  that's the mistake they made  it's real  at least got the birds overhead  then you could kinda  edit that shit in  and make it more believable  yeah  alright fair enough  time for guess the sound  what  sounds like a feature on a real radio show  i know 
[02:49:30]  what the hell is this about  we haven't done it  in quite a long time  do you know oppie one time  a bird went to the bathroom  and it landed on my teeth  that's not true  did it moisten them  no it hardened up  yeah  and it didn't go away for  seven days  seven days  they were stuck on my teeth  i really don't like edgar  i don't like edgar  shut up  shut up  shut up

[02:50:30]  well because the computer's in front of me  fucking communist  the computer's in front of me  the reason i like it  who is that bitch  because  it just does  that's not too good  but it just  for the entire show  just play  just shows pictures of  of chicks  naked  naked bro  it's just  nice fucking tits  to have right there in front of you  to just look down  and see some  fucking tits  girls hate when you refer their breasts  to that by the way  what are we gonna do with wow man  people are like  you gotta bring it back 
[02:51:00]  is it over  it's fucking done  it's over  it's so over  yeah  it was a thing  can we bring it back  what do you think  there's no bringing it back  no nothing  it's too fucking  you see the wow stickers still  it's nah you know  people tweet me wow stickers all the time  that's different than the wow thing  though  nothing sadder than a  a worn out wow sticker  on a pole in some lonely city  it was an afternoon thing  yeah  it was  and it's like  it was in a time when  all this shit wasn't available  yeah but if you're driving down the road  and you see like a pair 
[02:51:30]  a pair of tits  is it really old  no it's great  but it's not something that people really  it's been done  yeah  yeah  it's over johnny  all right  man  fair enough  tits  wanna do guess the sound  oh yeah  yes  what is it  i don't know  it's a terrible way to start the game  why  to ask what it is  it saves a lot of time though  wow  that's not what we're looking at  it's kind of brilliant actually 
[02:52:00]  if you think about it  why do you have don't dream it's over on  just thinking about wow  don't dream it's over  wow's not over dammit  that's great  it's not over  yeah  i won't hear from wow no more  won't see him no more  here's guess the sound  what's that  it's a man  it's a man  punching a teacup  it's a stupid gas 
[02:52:30]  oh god  let me hear that again  yeah  yeah  it's a song  it's a guy shooting an air rifle at a tin cup and knocking it onto a floor  but that would be way too obvious to me  jesus  and anti-climactic  yeah  a little bit  i'm hoping it's not that  if it is  yeah  you forgot how the game works  if it is this show got really lazy 
[02:53:00]  it's led zeppelin  it's led zeppelin  okay good  it's a guy that's a hubcap coming off a car in a garage  it's a fucking air lug nut  no  but it sounds like  it's got to be sexual in nature i would imagine  is it  well i think that's how we usually do guess the sound  and  well who chose this sound  let me tell you who chose it  yes  yeah 
[02:53:30]  the king of guess the sound dandy tube steaks  all right  okay  so  so it's gonna be something pretty  it could be something out  pretty out there  of course it is  it's not just you know  we're not a morning zoo  exactly  it's not a hubcap coming off out of the garage  yeah yeah yeah  alright let's hear it  wanna hear it again  i don't like jimmy's guess  this is  there's this  it's um  oh man that is  it's a girl  boggling 
[02:54:00]  i know what it is  yeah  yes  it's a girl shooting a volkswagen out of her cunt  oh man that's what i was gonna say  alright good  alright what's next  it's a paper plate  with  lima beans on it  what  falling into a pool  i'm gonna go with some kind of shit play  you think  i'm gonna go with some kind of shit play  shit play  oh the eric nagel story  it's on broadway  i'm sorry  eric i don't mean it  i'm gonna go with some 
[02:54:30]  i don't mean that  i apologize  i mean the things i say to you  i know but it's like an easy  i do though  i mean it  poor iraq  maybe jimmy doesn't but i always feel bad  i'm gonna go with some kind of shit play anthony comia  shit play  some kind of large shit  one more time  let me hear one more time  maybe not  it sounds too mechanical 
[02:55:00]  it's something very mechanical there  could it be a guy shooting a tin can  it sounds like something with an air  like compressed air  some type of metal being worked in some way  cut or dropped or  can you put enough air in your asshole to shoot something  not make it sound like a fucking  no  compressor  it's like  i'm sticking with the asshole on this one  okay  i really am  iraq  oh iraq 
[02:55:30]  i don't think he's that  uh  do you have a guess sam  do you know what it is  i know what it is  iraq you know what it is or no  no i  the  all right last time and then we'll get an answer all right all right listen closely here we go 
[02:56:00]  That part is tricky.  Yeah, there's a delay.  Something being shot at his asshole.  I have no idea.  Oh, is anyone close, Sam?  Jimmy's got the hubcaps and I got the asshole.  I got shit play and Jimmy's got hubcaps.  Who's closer?  It's hard to say.  I know what it is.  What is it, Paul?  It's the metal sound. 
[02:56:30]  That happens when a little foot kicks the mobile over.  How would you know what that sounds like?  When their little butt's hurting, they kick their feet out and the mobile knocks over.  It's horrible.  Waste of parents.  I hope so.  I have no idea what that is.  It's some kind of air, like nail gun or something like that.  Is compressed air used in any way?  I'm not going to be giving you hints. 
[02:57:00]  That means yes.  You just gave it away.  So it's compressed air.  Compressed air.  So he's shooting something.  Is he nailing something?  I just said I'm not going to give you hints.  All right, he's nailing something.  Okay.  I can read your face.  It's so obvious.  Okay.  Compressed air.  A nail gun?  I'm not going to give you hints.  God.  All right.  You gave that away.  So what is he nailing down?  I'm going to go with...  Shit.  I want to stick with the ass.  Some guy nailing his ball bag to a wooden plank and then ripping it out and the plank hits 
[02:57:30]  the floor.  Wow.  Okay.  You ready to see the video for the reveal?  I sure am, Sam.  I sure am.  Here's the guess the sound answer.  God, what the fuck?  Oh.  Oh, no.  I don't want to see this.  All right.  That's hilarious. 
[02:58:00]  Ah, shit.  Guy dropping weights.  A weightlifter faints.  It has nothing to do with anything sexual or wacky, body parts.  It's a guy, like, what is that, a deadlift?  Yeah.  The clean and jerk?  No, that's not the clean and jerk.  No, he's just deadlifting.  He's lifting.  He's gotten bent at the knees.  538 pounds.  Wow.  538 pounds.  He's bent at the knees.  He picks it up and then he just straightens his legs out and lifts it up.  It's an official lift.  And he drops the weights.  Yeah.  And then he proceeds to just fall over backwards, knocking his head on another weight machine thing. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, that's a clean lift.  He drops the weight, obviously.  Stands there and just completely passes out and hits his head.  He cracked his head.  That's hilarious.  Wow.  When he let go of that, all the blood just rushed out of his head.  Is that what it was?  Yeah.  He just completely lost the blood pressure to his head.  Wow.  It was probably all built up like when he's lifting all the bloods in your head and then  you let go and it just goes out of your head and you just fell right away. 
[02:59:00]  That was passed out for maybe two seconds.  It was a second.  Smashed his fucking head.  He really cracked his head on that metal rail.  That's fucking amazing.  Yeah, because he was just standing there and then boom.  A boom.  Very good.  I expected something a little.  Something with the genitalia, but it's my own problems.  Or shit play.  Or shit play.  Shit play.  Shit play.  It wasn't as easy to read as you thought I was.  No.  I read it perfectly.  I read it perfectly too.  You guys were both incorrect.  Nope.  We read it perfectly. 
[02:59:30]  Jim, you thought it was a hubcap falling off.  I was closest.  You were closest.  Definitely wasn't anybody nailing their shit or whatever you said.  Shitter.  Enough with this fucking grainy Jackson video.  It's stupid.  Yeah, I don't even know what's going on.  Oh, wait.  I'm sorry.  The power and abduction turned out to be a hoax.  Sorry.  It's different.  Hey, I want to say hi to Jenna Marvel.  Well, she follows me on Twitter, by the way.  Wow, look at that.  I was very excited yesterday.  I had the wrong Jenna Marbles at first. 
[03:00:00]  Yes, you did.  I really did.  She followed me, and then I found out it was the real one.  And I was like, oh, the real one.  Hey, she follows me.  And I was like, hi, Jenna.  And then she retweeted it and just put hashtag fail under it.  So I don't even know what that means.  Oh, boy.  But I think it's a fail.  You failed.  But she's following you?  Yeah, yeah.  She follows me.  And then we had a little DM chat, let's just say.  DM?  DM.  And, yes.  And when she comes to New York, I invited her on this very program. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, why would you do that?  Let me see her.  I want to see her.  You're trying to make moves.  You're using this show to make moves, sir.  It's what 17 years has been.  Yeah.  This is the chick that will be on the show.  What?  Oh, wait.  There's an advertiser.  Oh, ads.  So what about that whore in Canada?  That fucking chick?  Progressive girl, whatever she was in Canada?  You know what happened to her?  Oh, nice girl.  That's the T-Mobile girl.  Oh.  Yeah.  She's got a boyfriend. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, boo.  She's banging the Verizon guy.  Oh.  It's Mr. Burns.  Bubbles, you know what that makes you?  Look at her.  Smithers.  My hair makes me feel like I'm a little kid.  A sexual little kid.  So today I want to talk about the fact that I think I have a real problem.  And then hopefully someone will be like, I do the same thing, Jenna, so that I don't  have to feel so weird and bad about myself.  Here's my confession.  I, Jenna, Maury, Marvels, am addicted to apps. 
[03:01:30]  You know, like apps.  And it's getting to the point where my need to play these games.  Look, I didn't say it's fucking, you know.  Yesterday you said she was funny.  Good luck with that, Ant.  Well, look.  Good luck with that.  You said she was funny.  Some videos are very good, some not so much.  What's a good one?  Well, I want to give Ant the benefit down here.  I like the one where she was talking about her makeup and making yourself up to look  ugly.  Three stooges yesterday and today it's this.  What's happening to Ant?  You all right?  If she wasn't cute, she's hot as fuck.  The fact that she feels like a sexual kid, you probably just play that on a loop. 
[03:02:00]  No, I didn't see that.  No, no, it's not drunk makeup tutorial.  It's how to make yourself look ugly.  Did you sprain your funny bone?  No.  How to trick people into making her ugly.  Somebody stole her idea.  Oh, we did the ugly one.  Did you show that wasn't a commercial?  Yeah, we did do the ugly one.  We did the ugly one and that was kind of funny.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How to avoid telling people.  The ugly one wasn't bad.  I doubted it.  I like that one.  It wasn't bad.  We did it, Sam.  I don't think it was good.  She's millions of views. 
[03:02:30]  Where is she from, man?  Millions and millions.  She's in California.  YouTube loves characters.  That's why Chippa should take off.  Chippa doesn't, though.  Nobody cares about Chippa.  Chippa's going to take time to grow, but Chippa's going to take off.  Chipp needs to do a one-man show, too, like a solo camera show.  If you saw her fucking body, too, you'd all shut your fucking mouth.  Like an introduction, maybe.  She's gorgeous.  Or just like, you know, Chipp giving his perspective on the week of news.  No, I think Chippa out and about is, it'll work.  You just got to fucking work it.  People like to just sit there and like Jenna Marbles and all these YouTube people. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, but the Chippa shit is really funny.  It's just, it's a matter of time.  I'm not having a three-quarter life crisis, you assholes.  Three quarters.  Exactly.  Fuck wads.  All right.  Well, she's a bust, obviously.  No.  Good luck with that.  I want to have her come in, though.  She has almost two million followers.  She's very popular.  I know.  Did she say she would come in?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Fair enough.  When in New York.  And, you know, if she needs some place to stay, obviously, the compound has great accommodation. 
[03:03:30]  Look at her, see?  Look at that, right?  But does she think she's funny or does she know people just watch her videos because she's hot?  People think she's funny.  I can see where people would think she's funny.  I absolutely could see that.  I'm not saying she is.  I'm just saying she's got a thing going.  No.  Did she edit some shit?  Did she edit some shit?  Punch her up.  What's she saying?  I don't know.  Let me hear.  Nope.  Little?  Nope. 
[03:04:00]  Please?  Okay.  Just a tad.  So angry.  So angry.  Like, I'm not judging anybody in the gym.  I don't care.  Like, whatever.  At my gym, there's like a little all-women's section that I like to work out.  Eight million views.  Almost nine million.  There's no, like, creepy people.  I like to pick things up and put them down kind of guys.  You know what I mean?  Like a commercial.  So I go work out in this little, like, all-women's section.  And there's always someone on, like, the elliptical next to me. 
[03:04:30]  Uh-huh.  You know the people that do this?  Yeah, Jenna.  And they're like looking over.  Yeah.  Like this.  Like, you can't tell.  You know how I'm doing?  Yeah, yeah.  That's how I'd be if I was talking to her because I wanted to think I'm interested.  How long have you been on there?  I'm going on.  God, yes.  I know.  I feel like I'm taking the SATs.  I'm like, keep your eye on your own.  Right?  Right?  I hear you.  Yes.  Yes, Jenna.  Yeah.  Meanwhile, I'm just thinking, oh, I'm going to fuck you. 
[03:05:00]  I'm going to fucking stick my dick in that mouth.  Yeah.  You're not the only one she follows.  I'm sorry, that's why I tell my dick, you know.  Jim Norton?  But I talked about how when I work out, I use the elliptical.  Well, one big happy family here, aren't we?  That's where you're doing like five minutes of like, you know, jogging or like regular  pace.  And then for a minute, you're like five minutes, you do like hard sprints.  She's just rambling now.  Now, I'm not like on the elliptical.  Maybe this one isn't like supposed to be funny.  Maybe it's just an informative one.  None of them.  Maybe it's just informative.  I do what any other regular person would do. 
[03:05:30]  And I click this little button that people don't seem to know exists.  She's a hot chick, though.  And I go up, up, up, up, up.  I'm on like level 30.  And I'm going like this fast.  Like this.  Sprinting for a minute.  That's like sprinting like this.  She's in great shape.  She does work out.  Who cares?  What?  Who cares, I said?  What are you doing?  You know that look that that person next to you and you, where they're like, I almost  glowed in.  Oh, you're still basking in the love of new marriage.  Yeah, give that a little time, my friend. 
[03:06:00]  But she's not funny.  And I can like steal that.  She's great.  No, she's not.  Chip likes her.  She's not entertaining.  And I'm over there.  Chip's digging her.  Stop looking at me.  Like, just stop looking at me.  Like, clearly, you know what you're doing.  Yeah.  Because you have your elliptical on level zero.  And you're going like this.  On level zero?  For 30 minutes.  How does she come up with this stuff?  And you've earned a total of 45 calories.  And when you keep looking at mine, you may notice that it's only been 25 minutes.  Funny a number.  You've earned 7,000 calories.  Like, maybe while you were looking over at my elliptical, you would have noticed that. 
[03:06:30]  Maybe you wouldn't judge me so much.  Maybe you wouldn't think I was so crazy.  Like, people that use machines.  I always see someone running on the treadmill like this.  Yes, Jenna.  Motherfucker.  Take that button.  Push that level up.  Make that treadmill go like this.  And then try running on.  Up really high angle.  Maybe then you'll get a better workout.  You're right, Jenna.  Just a guess.  Just throwing it out there.  You're on the elliptical.  Every single person in the gym.  Where's she from?  Except for me.  I don't know.  She's got a weird little accent there. 
[03:07:00]  It's adorable, isn't it?  They're all just going...  Isn't her accent adorable?  She's very cute.  Oh, man.  I'm waist-deep in a pool full of molasses.  Like, working my ass up over here.  I would hate to be in molasses.  I'd get my asshole cheeks stuck together.  We should do a video together.  Turn this down a little bit.  I'll do it with you.  I'm good.  Okay.  I'm like...  You think I'm just going that slow?  Yeah, what are you, a bunch of molasses in your shoes?  I have a towel.  I'm, like, wiping my face.  Wiping your face with what?  A bunch of, like, common duty and stuff? 
[03:07:30]  Oh, no.  Chip.  It's not very nice.  No.  Yeah, yes, yes.  I'm so angry.  I'm angry, too.  I'm going to go to the gym today.  Go to the gym.  Why don't you ask Jim to take you to the gym?  Then you'll be in a gym loop or something.  Oh, no, Chip.  That's not...  It sucks at the elliptical.  Yeah, I suck at the elliptical, too.  Goo.  Goo.  Goo.  I got some on my shoe.  What?  How did it come on your shoe?  Like, real tight.  Yeah, my ass is real tight.  My Uncle Paul said so, too. 
[03:08:00]  He said, Chipper, it feels like a glove.  Milking me like you're on a farm or something.  To get my shit done...  Get your shit done?  Why would you want shit done once you drop it out and shit?  Oh, Chip.  No.  She's just...  You're a crazy person.  I ain't crazy.  I'm fucking sick.  See?  We had a good video together.  Jenna and Chipper.  What's that bottom left?  Is that her or someone else?  That's her, wow.  Whatever.  I hope she comes in and Chip does get to do a video with her.  Oh, fuck with the commercials. 
[03:08:30]  Look, click that thing.  It says you can skip it.  Skip it.  It says you can skip it in 10 seconds.  Then we had to wait.  Now, fast forward to her.  20 million views.  Wow, 19 million.  Because she gets on it.  She has her bikini.  Yeah, here we go.  Whoa.  Oh, man.  Look at her fucking body, dude.  That awful white paneling.  Holy shit.  She's dancing in a bikini.  Hence the 20 fucking million views.  Exactly.  God damn. 
[03:09:00]  Oh.  50 million on that one.  42 million.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  She's just dancing around in a bikini.  In different bikinis.  She's smoking.  Right?  Yeah.  That's hot, right?  Jesus Christ.  She's doing the robot.  How funny is that?  It's not funny.  Missed me swimming. 
[03:09:30]  She's in the bathtub.  God, that's funny.  No, it's not funny.  She's just in a bikini tub.  That's hilarious.  Jimmy hates her.  I do, too.  No, I know.  I mean, she's hot.  Oh, so hot.  She has 42 million views on some of these.  That's amazing to me.  It's crazy.  She's, like, pretending that she's on YouTube because she's funny.  Like, if she's pretending to be funny while she's doing this. 
[03:10:00]  She's not.  She's funny.  Then how come Jim doesn't do his comedy in a bikini?  Well.  I would do it.  I'd be in the pool.  That's sad.  But I would be snorkeling.  What I would do is I would leave the bathtub there.  Yeah.  And, like, fucking 19, 20 minutes to go by.  And then I'd pop my head up with a snorkel and go, that don't make no sense.  Oh.  And I'd go right back in like I was fucking streaming.  19 or 20 minutes?  Yeah, get the anticipation, build it up.  And then I'll fucking go right back under with the whales and sharks and plankton.  50 million views.  That would get.  I know.  First day.  I mean, she's hot. 
[03:10:30]  She can fill out a bikini.  Are you enjoying this, though?  No, she's horrible.  I'm so bothered by her and people like her.  You're just jealous.  Of what?  That I can't fill out a bikini like that?  Yeah.  Where does she have all the videos that are hosted on YouTube?  Yeah.  Play a little more.  I want to see what she does.  In case it gets really crazy.  She's doing the best, though.  She's splashing.  She's splashing in a bikini with drape tits.  Yeah.  That's what somebody with Down syndrome does.  You miss me swimming in a waterfall? 
[03:11:00]  Oh, she's turning the shower on.  But she's not being funny.  She's being sexy.  Well, she's being, like, hot and retarded, which is funny.  And nobody is even paying attention to the fact that she's being retarded.  No, she's sitting on your father like a little loophole.  Come on.  That's cool.  You like that?  I do.  Let it.  Ha, ha, ha, water bottle.  You miss me winning a wet t-shirt contest.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  Oh, they, why'd she blur it?  I can't see, Sam.  Oh, my God. 
[03:11:30]  Look at those.  Yeah, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You miss me laying on the beach, hanging out with all the stray Mexican dogs.  Come on.  Stop licking my ass.  Stop licking my ass.  Oh, man.  She doesn't say that to me, too.  Oh, God.  She was saying crying.  Right?  She was tied up.  Look at that.  Oh, God.  That's infuriating. 
[03:12:00]  My ass is infuriating me.  Oh, my God.  Are you picturing what she would look like being intimate?  Get off.  Stop.  Oh, lucky dogs.  They're licking her.  Hey.  They're licking her.  Oh, God.  Stop.  Dude.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  I don't care if she's not funny.  She's so skinny.  You want me to see you?  She knows guys are going to just watch this.  20 million will watch this. 
[03:12:30]  That's actually three guys who watch this.  Yeah, but she's talentless.  No.  Yes.  No.  No.  No.  But hopefully this has given you guys some ideas of things that you can do when your spring  break trip gets canceled.  Motherfucking fuck Cancun fuck.  What the fuck?  That's funny, right?  Don't forget to subscribe to my channel.  You know who's a funny female who's good looking?  Amy Schumer.  She doesn't have to put out bikini videos and da-da-da.  I'm not going to argue that point. 
[03:13:00]  And she lets fucking cab drivers stick fingers in a cunt.  Great story.  She is very beautiful.  I love that.  She looked great on the fucking 4th of July when we went over her house.  Amy, y'all here.  All right.  I'm tired, buddy.  I'm going to go home and relax.  Yeah, I got to get.  All right.  And don't forget.  Thank you, Jenna.  I hope she listened.  I'm in Montreal Friday night doing a live show at Saget on the movie channel in Canada,  whatever that is.  I heard it's a very, very big channel. 
[03:13:30]  Yes.  Amy is doing it.  Jimmy Carr, who's a really big-faced British comedian.  He's a very large face.  Very, very funny dude.  Very funny.  And Mike Wellmont.  It's a really great show.  That's it.  So do that.  And we'll see you same bat time, same bat channel.  Don't bring that up.  Oh, right.  It's very insensitive.  Don't be so batty.  I'm sorry.  Good one, Chip.  And yeah, see you tomorrow.  Thank you.  All right.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.
