<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, originating from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, kicked off their 2007 Traveling Virus Comedy Tour with a poolside show.  The broadcast, filled with highly offensive language targeting various groups, featured a large audience identifiable by their black t-shirts.  Numerous A-list guests were present throughout the broadcast including Ralphie May, Patrice O'Neal, Bobby Kelly, Joe Rogan, Jim Norton, Otto and George, and  Frank Caliendo.  The comedians frequently interacted with the audience and the hosts; one audience member notably had a heated exchange with Opie and Anthony.  Dancers from the Spearmint Rhino strip club also made an appearance.

The show was largely improvisational, bouncing between numerous topics.  These included discussions about the upcoming tour,  the Imus situation on XM Radio (including racial slurs used in discussions thereof), a one-armed caller's joke and the alleged insurance scam behind his disability, a listener offering sexual favors for tickets, censorship struggles on other radio stations,  and the planned protest against NBC.

Significant segments involved the recounting of Jim Norton defecating in another comedianâ€™s hotel room bucket, Robert Kelly throwing Rich Voss's expensive hat into the audience (with subsequent graphic discussions of its potential uses), and a lengthy, graphically detailed audience-participation segment involving the forceful removal of chest hair using duct tape.  The broadcast also included a backstage segment with Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane, who discussed their experiences at the pool show and recounted a previous bar fight.

A substantial portion of the show focused on the personalities and comedic styles of various comedians.  There was extensive analysis of Rich Voss's comedic approach, contrasting it with Bobby Kelly's.  The perceived negativity from Bobby Kelly significantly impacted the show's dynamic, prompting discussions of their experiences at previous performances and perceived bombing experiences.  Frank Caliendo's impressions were showcased, and a graphic description of Ari Shaffir's butthole caused Bobby Kelly to vomit. Anthony's girlfriend's influence on his clothing choices was also discussed.  The hosts frequently ribbed Bob Kelly about his weight and clothing choices.

Another significant segment involved an anecdote about a bat, which segued into Patrice O'Neal's commentary on relationships and storytelling.  The hosts then discussed their recent appearance on Fox News in Las Vegas, where they deliberately ignored pre-written talking points about the Don Imus controversy, openly admitting to using racial slurs during the interview.  They critiqued the media's use of euphemisms and selective outrage regarding offensive language.  Opie also recounted defecating in Bob Kelly's hotel room garbage bag.

The entire broadcast was punctuated with frequent interruptions, insults, offensive jokes, and the liberal use of racial slurs and homophobic epithets, targeting physical attributes, race, and sexual orientation.  A press conference, part of the show, also featured further offensive jokes and comments.  One comedian even threw another's hat into the pool.  The show concluded with announcements of upcoming tour dates, further ribbing of guests, a commercial for XM Satellite Radio, and a series of outtakes from that commercial. The overall tone was highly informal, provocative, and deeply offensive.

Well, we're on the Rich and Bonnie show.  We're live from the Hard Rock Casino.  We're at the pool.  It's obvious to tell who the O&A fans are from the people who are just hanging out at the casino. 
[00:01:00]  Because, thank God, they're all wearing T-shirts.  I know.  Could they have picked a better color?  Black.  It's 200 degrees out here.  And they're wearing blacks.  We should start betting on how many are going to faint before the end of this broadcast.  You know what?  We're doing a free and after show.  And at 3 o'clock, Opie and Anthony will come down and do the press conference to release the other dates going where the tour is. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, tonight is the Traveling Virus O&A kick-off show.  Rich Voss, Rich Voss, Rich Voss, Rich Voss, Rich Voss.  What's that again?  Comes out of Kenny, getting the crowd fired up for Rich Voss.  Bonnie, Bonnie, Bonnie.  And now, chanting my name as the...  Bonnie, Bonnie.  And now the baby.  This sounds like a...  Baby, baby.  This sounds like a line outside the door to our house. 
[00:02:00]  You know, they said come down and do the radio before and after the show.  And they say, you know, you go out by the pool.  They didn't say that we were being broadcast throughout Vegas, the casino.  Everybody could hear us in the casino and throughout this whole grounds.  So one big yell from the O&A fans.  O&A rock.  One big time.  O&A rock.  That's horrible.  So we're going to try to keep the fucks to a minimum.  Yeah.  And even though we're being broadcast on XM, we can say whatever we want. 
[00:02:30]  We're going to...  Fucking daddy.  What's that?  We're getting heckled.  The guy said, who's your daddy?  Who's your daddy?  That's why I want to know if anybody does DNA testing.  Hopefully it's you, Circus, and the baby will have two breasts to feed off of.  Rich Voss already on fire.  I'm being...  Flamming people in the audience.  I'm being heckled by a third world, out-of-shape human.  Okay?  I'll have you deported from this pool.  I know you swam across this pool to get here. 
[00:03:00]  He's uncomfortable with the balloons in his butt.  We have a great show tonight.  All you guys are going to the show, right?  Yeah!  Let's go over the lineup real quick tonight.  I'll be hosting the first part of the show.  Rich Voss.  We have Patrice O'Neal, Ralphie Mae, Otto and George, Bobby Kelly, Frank Caliendo, Joe Rogan, and Jim Norton on the show tonight. 
[00:03:30]  Jimmy Norton.  This is going to be a killer show.  I know a lot of you know the comics.  If there's other people by the pool out there, maybe the guy with the cowboy hat that looks like a perfect 10.  Look at him out there.  He's got like 400 girls around him.  He's got cowboy boots on, too.  At the pool.  He really took it to the limit.  These guys did sit-ups all winter long for this weekend.  Look at him.  Oh, he's showing his tighty-whities.  Look at that.  What does it say on your butt?  It's not going to answer. 
[00:04:00]  We can't see that far.  What does it say on his butt?  Has been entered.  Anyhow.  Look at the girls out there.  They're all sitting there saying, what can we suck out of these guys?  All right?  We're just going to bone them dry and then go back to Idaho to our husbands, okay?  There are a lot of sluts out there.  You know, the whores out at the pool should really take a look at this pathetic O&A audience 
[00:04:30]  and sleep with one of them as just, you know, like some charity work that you could do.  There's a couple here I could pick out.  This is great.  I guarantee they don't have any diseases because they've never had sex before.  So this is your opportunity for a clean.  This is great.  I don't know how to do this broadcast without swearing.  This is great to do the first gig on the tour in Vegas.  I don't drink.  I have 21 years sober.  I quit gambling.  I don't smoke.  My wife is pregnant.  I have nothing here to look forward to.

Don't black people have naturally thicker skins?  I don't know.  I think so.  I got black blood in me.  I mean, I wish I got that big crank, but instead I got bad crank.  That's how it goes.  You got black blood in you? 
[00:06:00]  Yep.  Get the heck out of me.  Ralphie.  Ralphie, swear to God.  Just because you eat fried food doesn't mean you have black blood in you.

The black guy jumps up, and the white people are going, hey, hey, let's cut it here right  now.  Let's stop this.  Hey, we know the struggle, brother.  I grew up in an all-black neighborhood in Princeton, okay?  What's that?  I know.  People are like, where's Princeton?  It doesn't matter.  Sometimes you do a joke for eight people.  I'm used to it, all right?  We got a brother right here with a Jewish star. 
[00:07:30]  I know the struggle.  You know, when I was flying into town last night, listen, when I was flying, we were flying  in, and we saw all the lights and everything.  You got to thank Bugsy Siegel, the head Jew gangster that started this whole thing, all right?  Genius.  Genius.  Just another Jew that's a genius.  You know what I'm saying, Ralph?  Absolutely.  Do you have any...  This is why people don't like Jews, because they're always talking about what a genius  they are.  No, I'm not Jewish, but I'm making a Jew.  My wife's pregnant, too.  I'm making a Jew, too.  Ralphie.  I know. 
[00:08:00]  We need to name our baby daughter.  Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?  I don't know.  If it's a boy or a girl, I have no idea.  Really?  You didn't do the ultrasound or anything?  No, no.  How do you know if you want to keep it?  Oh, yeah, right?  So true.  So true.  Bobby said, what, if it's a boy, what, if it's a girl, we keep it?  Yeah, no, if it's a boy, we're keeping it.  If it's a girl, we're going to just drop it off at a local hospital, no questions asked,  and try again. 
[00:08:30]  There you go.  Keep up.  This is a fight.  That's awesome.  No, I don't know yet.  It's only the 20th week, and she's on the road.  So, you know, she's in Chattanooga, Tennessee right now.  So, so it goes.  Yeah.  Are you excited to have a baby?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's awesome, dude.  Yeah.  I can't believe I did it.  Don't eat it, Ralphie.  I wouldn't dream of it, but trust me, I get as close as I can.  Listen, let me tell you something.  It's so exciting.  Like, I'm not, I mean, Bonnie's really excited because, you know, it's her first.  I got two other daughters.  My daughter went to the prom.  You have kids? 
[00:09:00]  I, uh, my daughter went to the prom last night.  The excitement goes from, you know, to, oh my God, keep your hands off her, you know  what I mean?  Mm-hmm.  I took pictures of my daughter going to the prom last night, and I'm going, if this guy's  anything like me, you know.  He's not getting laid?  Uh.  Oh.  I'm hilarious.  Hey, Ralphie, have you ever slept with a pregnant woman?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, Rich hasn't.  That's what I'm asking.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Well, Rich, it's really fun.  I don't know.  She comes into the room.  You should try it sometime.  She comes into the room.  Has she blamed you for the whole pregnancy thing?  Has she gotten mad at you and gone, this is all your fault, and it's like, hey, you  could have taken it in the face?  I was sick in the beginning, but.  I didn't tell her, right?  I wanted to swallow.  Yeah, that a girl.  That's a spirit.  I'm not talking this way.  Rich Voss is a clean act.  I'm one step below Brian Regan.  Listen, Bonnie, we wanted a baby.  We wanted another baby. 
[00:10:00]  I already have two babysitters.  I have my other daughters.  Oh, you're lucky, dude.  You know, we wanted a baby.  And we need a name, though.  Is there any, we need a name for, we're having a girl.  We need a girl, a good female baby's name.  Give me a, I'll give you a shirt.  Who has a good name?  What's the name?  Try Rich.  That's a great girl's name.  Rich.  I think we should put Bonnie and Rich together and call her Bitch.  What's that?  What's her name?  Rain is a good Jewish name.  Rain?  Raina. 
[00:10:30]  Rain, all right, give them a shirt.  Raina.  Huh?  Raina?  No, I just did that to kill time.  And try to remember, she's going to be an emcee.  She's going to be an opening guy.  Two feature acts have a baby.  Boom.  An emcee is born.  That's awesome.  I can't, some guys yell one from the back.  Jezebel.  Sarah.  Jezebel?  Jezebel Voss.  Someone said Sarah.  I love Sarah, that's a great name.  Rebecca?  It's too common.  How about Lila? 
[00:11:00]  Lila, no, my father's new wife is Lila, and she kind of gets on my nerves.  How about Sinequa?  Sinequa, I love it.  There you go.  I love it.  We'll get her into college easier.  All right.  So, this town, how many of you guys are gambling out here?  That's real great, Rich.  On the radio, I asked for a show of hands.  Really, Brick, you know, when I'm working to a live audience, that's the first thing  that comes to mind, they're a live audience, okay? 
[00:11:30]  I know that.  People on the radio can tell by the response, a lot of people are gambling, okay?  It's Vegas, really?  You had to ask the question.  Do you guys know what slot machines are?  What's my...  White people play like this.  Thank you.  Hey, wait.  Well, your homeboy, that wasn't me.  That was him.  All right?  You can't even stand up.  What's that?  Come here.  Come here.  Hold on.  They're talking to them.  Oh, he's an alternative black.  I have a credit.  I have a line.  You have a credit.  Blockbuster cards are not credit, okay? 
[00:12:00]  Oh, wait.  Wait.  Kill Whitey.  That's funny.  Okay.  Listen.  First of all, eat a sandwich, okay?  Oh, yeah, man.  I'm on a diet.  I'm on a sandwiches.  You need a hug.  Let's make fun of more black people.  No, we didn't make fun.  Imus, call me.  Call me.  You can't call you.  Black hoes, I love you.  You can't call you.  Your phone's cut off.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  You know humor.  You know humor.  You know humor.  I love you.  I love you.  I'm going to go get a tan.  All right.  Because black people are tan.  That's all right.  Let's go out of there. 
[00:12:30]  Have a good time.  All right.  What's your name real quick?  Because I'm not going to pick on you.  Let's play a game.  That did seem racist, wretch.  Yeah, that was a little bit.  Listen, I didn't go after anybody.  Ralphie did, but he attacked me.  I didn't go after anybody.  I just said I'm as pissed off black people.  That's what happens.  You know, revenge is a best served collard greens.  What?  Look, people are people.  That's how I look at it. 
[00:13:00]  Can't we all just?  No.  Listen, I'm a Jew.  I know the struggle.  You know, we build pyramids.  We were the first slaves, okay?  No, geez.  What's that?  No, geez.  That's the only reason I don't ever go to the luxury and gamble, because my people help  build those things, okay?  Can you imagine being up in a penthouse in that casino?  Anyhow, here's the thing.  Jews have a struggle.  We all have a struggle.  Who cares?  I don't think that guy was serious anyhow.  I think he's so drunk, and he's just so happy, you know, to be the one black guy that 
[00:13:30]  can swim.  That's hilarious.  Now he's mad.  He's not mad at you.  I don't think he's mad.  I can't tell.  He's mad.  Oh, he is mad?  He's mad.  He said, kill Whitey, and he calls you racist.  That's hilarious.  I apologize.  Oh, all right.  I guess I started.  I think you should start apologizing.  I apologize right now.  It's kind of the apology to her now.  Listen, it's comedy.  Here's the thing.  If he doesn't have tickets to the show, who gives a shit?  And even if he does.  Al Sharpton's coming in right now, Rich. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, that's awesome.  Oh, my God.  Where are the cameras?  You know what?  It's comedy.  Listen, let's attack somebody else real quick.  Come over here so we can hear you.  Oh, you know.  You know what?  I don't want to start a riot this early in the show.  Let's do it.  It's okay.  I think the D&D festival will insulate us.  A mini riot.  What we're going to do is.  It's like a wolf mother concert out here.  Jesus Christ.  It's like what?  A wolf mother concert.  All right.  So here's the deal.  What's your wildest Vegas story, Ralphie? 
[00:14:30]  Do you have any wild Vegas stories?  I took $20 and made it into $7,000 at the Sahara, stoned out of my bone on roulette.  I played for 10 minutes.  Roulette?  Nobody wins that roulette.  Swear to God, I hit 17 four times in a row.  Four times.  Were you high and you thought that happened or that really happened?  No, that really happened.  Nobody was more shocked than me.  I show up with all this money.  I'm like, whoa, dude.  That kicks ass.  Do you have a Vegas story?  Yeah, it's the exact opposite of Ralphie's. 
[00:15:00]  Then I went over to the New York, New York hotel and was raped and robbed and left for dead in a dumpster.  It was really.  New York, New York.  I have a lot of Vegas stories.  I had one Vegas story with a girl.  I met a girl and I took her to my room and not against her will.  And we're fooling around and she said, if you get me an English muffin downstairs, you could have sex in a certain place.  I don't understand. 
[00:15:30]  What do those two things have to do with each other?  Wow, she really wanted an English muffin, huh?  Well, thank God Patrice is here.  Patrice is here to save us.  And also, Bobby Kelly is walking up.  Oh, fantastic.  Hey, everybody.  Is this stage going to hold?  Yeah, baby.  Ralphie, Patrice, and Bobby Kelly?  I don't know.  Rich's ego?  Holy crap. 
[00:16:00]  Man, it's action facts.  We're on full tilt.  This is the whole crew.  This is going to be the show.  This is going to be one of the hottest comedy tours this year.  I'm telling you.  Ever.  That's who I've ever been a part of.  Patrice, come sit down over here.  We've already gotten in a fight with the token black dude.  He's over there.  Ladies and gentlemen, Patrice O'Neal.  Patrice O'Neal flying in from Fox News every show. 
[00:16:30]  Patrice is so happy.  How hot are you?  Look at what you're wearing.  Patrice is so happy.  How did he brought him out of the fields into the house?  Okay?  Is that why you begged me to come down to help you make your joke stupid?  Go ahead.  Do it without me.  No.  Please, how can we do this without you?  And why are you dressed like Dean Martin?  He looks like a Cuban barber, doesn't he? 
[00:17:00]  A Cuban barber.  I told him not to wear it.  When the moon hits your eye like a big piece of pie.  That's the morning.  These ladies are...  There's some silicone on the stage.  Finally, I don't have the biggest boobs up here.  Jesus, thank God.  Wow, look at this.  What club are they from? 
[00:17:30]  Spearmint Rhino.  Yes.  Spearmint Rhino.  Yes.  The hottest strip club in the city.  The one with the blonde hair.  What's her name?  Hi.  Hi.  That's a weird name, hi.  I'm Julie.  Good to see you.  Julie.  Come on, fellas.  Give it up for these straight-headed hoes.  Look at these.  Look at these girls. 
[00:18:00]  And you dance at club Rhino.  Nighttime dancers are like Tuesday morning dancers.  You're nighttime, right?  Nighttime dancers.  Nighttime dancers.  Nighttime?  They're obviously nighttime dancers.  Yeah, they are.  They're extremely very hot.  They make a lot of money.  Thank you.  Pay for their assets.  The blonde.  And Julie, are you from Vegas here?  Yeah, I'm from Vegas.  So was it your dream to dance here in Vegas?  To get naked for Vegas men, yes.  That was it?  That was my dream, baby.  Oh, Jesus.  You got to love a girl with a dream.  You got to love a girl with a dream. 
[00:18:30]  God bless you.  Well, what happens when you turn 19 and you're over the hill?  What are you going to do after that?  I can go.  Better get a plan.  You can always become a waitress here at the Hard Rock.  Do you four ever talk around and talk like Uncle Walked Into The Room stories, you know,  as kids?  None of those stories ever come out?  No, no, that's great.  All right.  That's enormous.  That brought the show to a dead halt again.  Yeah, good one.  Boy, do these people really judge by the pool here.  You try to wing it with dancers.  All of a sudden, you know, we're talking to dancers, all right? 
[00:19:00]  They don't have a lot of you.  Ask them which one's working their way through school.  Yeah.  You can ask them.  None of them are working their way through school.  They're great.  Just remember, I know nice girls.  I went to a dirty one, and I'm not going to say the name of it, but it rhymes with Mita.  And Mita, this girl came up and goes, hey, do you want a lap dance?  I got condoms.  Okay, stabby.  No, thank you.  I was in a dance club.  We went after a show in Philly.  We went to an O&A show. 
[00:19:30]  We went to a strip club, me, Norton, and a bunch of everyone.  And I'm talking to this dancer, and I was showing her pictures of my kids.  Like, I really thought she liked me.  I go to Norton, and I go, I think she likes me.  And they just all laughed at me, right?  Yeah, that's what a stripper wants to see.  Oh, you got kids?  They just, they say, can I see pictures of your kids so they can get you to open up your wallet  and see if it's worth their time.  That's what they're doing.  Snap.  Bobby Kelly.  Yeah, what's up? 
[00:20:00]  What's up, guys?  How are you guys doing?  All right?  Thank you, Danny.  Bobby won some big money last night, didn't you, Bobby?  Why not?  Well, Opie was sitting down, and they let me take a seat.  And two hands after that, I won $500.  So, yeah, $500.  Then $600.  Come on.  So $700 total, yeah.  And I'm going to buy a whore for everybody tonight.  $500 plus $600 is $700.  Yeah, $500.  In Vegas it is.  Why don't all you guys just leave so we have something left for tonight so you're not completely  as disappointed as you're not? 
[00:20:30]  This is horrendous.  Are there any chicks?  There's one right here.  There's one chick.  There's another chick.  There's two chicks in fucking 900 humps.  There's another chick right there.  Hey, come on.  Come on, ONA girls.  Can we move the chicks up front?  Hey, any hot ONA girls to challenge these girls here?  Come on, you messes.  Yeah.  Show them.  Yeah, ONA.  ONA fans are hot.  ONA girls have, like, either their ass is nice or their tits are nice.  It's not both.  No, no.  That's, this is like, right now, pork roll comparing themselves to Scrapple. 
[00:21:00]  How dare you attack these girls?  Come on, move, move.  I don't like how much your teeth is shining in the sun.  Jesus, toilet bowl mouth.  You need sunglasses for your teeth, Ro.  Where's the hot ONA?  Oh, there's a one.  There's one right here.  God bless you.  Here comes another one.  Here's one right here.  Delicious.  Look at this guy right here.  How hot is he?  Right here?  No, right here.  This guy right up front.  I'm Mrs. White Phillip. 
[00:21:30]  You what?  I'm Mrs. White Phillip.  Mrs. White Phillip.  Yes.  Really?  Yes.  Well, I mean, what do you want to get me arrested in Vegas?  It's not legal to say that.  Hey, hey.  Yes.  You want to have a contest to find the hottest ONA fan and get some shirts after a break?  Yeah, I would say so.  Yeah, go ahead.  I would say so, definitely.  Not even just the hottest ONA fan.  Can you say that with more confidence, though?  Can you try it again?  The one that everybody agrees can challenge these girls up here because I'm fed up with  their ONA fans. 
[00:22:00]  I don't like Voss's lack of confidence on his own show.  I don't like how they're sitting there with that perfect stripper posture.  We want some real women up there.  So, after the break.  They're not ONA fans.  These bodybuilding chicks over here with abs.  Bodybuilding chicks.  Look at them.  How are you doing?  What are you, like UFC fighters or something?  Hey, what's up, Joe?  What's going on?  Joe Rogan.  Go Rogan, man.  All right, we're going to take a short break.  We'll be right back.  Welcome back, folks. 
[00:22:30]  XM 202.  Traveling Virus.  Kickoff show.  Hard Rock.  The Traveling Virus 2007.  We got everybody here.  We got a microphone, Joe?  We got ONA.  Otto and George just came in.  Joe Rogan.  Oh.  Opian Anthony.  This is great.  On our own show, and we get the guest mics.  Fantastic. 
[00:23:00]  Thank you, Rich.  This is the rich and funny show.  I was listening in the hotel room.  I'm like, man, we got to get down there immediately.  The boss is bombing.  You're not going to blame this on me.  Actually, you guys are doing a good job, man.  What's up, Vegas?  Vegas.  Yeah.  Say, Rich, boss.  Yeah, I was watching from one of the rooms up there, and there's a definite line where  you see the ONA fans and the hot chicks, and never the tween shall meet. 
[00:23:30]  The line.  I'm teasing.  No.  No, you got a couple of ringers, didn't you?  I think the Hard Rock said, look, these are some of the fattest, ugliest guys ever.  Put some hot chicks in the crowd.  Or we get a bad rap.  ONA chicks, ONA guys, and hot chicks, or otherwise known as rapists and victims.  They cheer rape.  That's hilarious. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, it's a convention of the official before-photographed people.  There goes the question whether that Don Imus thing had any effect.  Oh, yeah.  Rogan!  What's up?  I didn't even see Joe Rogan.  I was just saying, there goes the answer to whether that Don Imus thing is going to  have any effect on you guys.  Immediately with the rape jokes.  Right back.  Jimmy doesn't fucking flinch.  Yeah, I'm sure that'll be taken out of context, and they'll try to get us off the air.  They'll YouTube that right now.  Are we allowed to still say nappy-headed hoes?  I don't know.  I just...  Yeah. 
[00:24:30]  Somebody needs to make a fucking nappy-headed hoes song now.  It's too late.  It's got to happen now.  I think if you can prove they're actually nappy-headed hoes, it's all right.  Oh, stop it, you straight, lovely, conditioned ho.  Yeah, Voss is a nappy-headed douche.  There's nothing offensive about that.  It's the truth.  Look at this hat.  Look at this effing hat.  Jesus Christ.  He's fucking dressed like Hyman Roth right before he got shot. 
[00:25:00]  Cheechy, good thing there you are.  In the Florida airport.  I'm just a Jew looking for sanctuary in the United States.  You don't come to Vegas and talk to Ridge Boss that way.  Like that.  I hope you get shot in the eye during a massage, you hump.  I don't know if they're laughing at us in the pool.  I don't know.  Are they laughing with us or at us?  That's what I'm trying to figure out.  I don't know.  All I know is in all the time I was looking at the pool, I never saw one person get out 
[00:25:30]  to take a leak.  So, I'm not sure.  And they're all drinking, so.  And they're all ripped.  Look at the three guys how ripped they are under the hut right there.  They're just like three tens.  They're just going to come in and take our women.  I don't think you should ever talk about a dude and give him a number.  Yeah, Rich.  That's a bad move.  There's hot chicks everywhere.  You could say he's a handsome guy, strapping, but you give him a number, you're thinking about  fucking him.  Really?  You're thinking about blowing him at least.  He gave him a high number, too.  He gave him a ten.  Maybe just a five or a four.  Yeah, he gave him an I would give in number. 
[00:26:00]  Hey, Pop.  I would let you rape him.  You lose that money last night?  I ran up to my room and put it in my shoe.  Bobby, you haven't ran anywhere in the last eight years.  You ran to your room.  He put the chips in his shoe and they looked like they were run over by a train when he  got back to his room.  How weird is this doing a regular radio show with people just fucking staring at you?  Yeah, it's a little strange.  Bobby hit for 40 to 1 last night.  Straight flush. 
[00:26:30]  Straight flush after I got up from the seat.  Big fucking spender.  Would you have 10 bucks up there on the pair plus, you cheap fuck?  I told you to go big, too.  I told you to go big.  He did.  His stomach.  We were playing.  Just to explain to everyone, we were playing three cars.  Anthony's on a fucking roll.  He's skinny.  The guy's a mush.  He came over to the table.  We were doing fine.  We were kicking ass, Patrice, right?  Everyone's winning.  The table's all happy.  And then he comes over, sits down, and just the cooler.  He sat down.  Everyone's losing.  I can't help if you have a fucking gambling problem. 
[00:27:00]  You're throwing thousands down.  The pit boss came over and comped your room just for how much you were ripping off from  us, y'all.  That seat was so cold.  I got up.  Two hands later, he hits for a straight flush.  Oh, yeah.  40 to 1.  He's still standing there.  Looking at this idiot in his seat, getting a straight flush.  That is annoying.  I didn't even know what a straight flush was.  Yeah, he didn't even know.  What?  Is that good?  Yeah, you idiot.  You see all the colorful chips they're giving you?  That's good.  Don't get mad at me.  What's wrong with you?  What are these black chips for? 
[00:27:30]  They're hookers?  There are hundreds of people standing around just waiting for something to happen.  Don't hold your breaths.  That's tonight.  You want us to blow a wad here?  Look it.  Every ONA fan has a shirt on.  Not one ONA fan has a black shirt on.  Silly me.  I thought in Vegas, maybe some gambling jokes would go over.  Jesus.  You guys should all take your shirts off and be proud of your fat tits and go over there  with those guys with abs.  Don't listen to him.  Take your black t-shirts off and be proud of what you got. 
[00:28:00]  Come on.  No.  Hey, we got one guy.  One guy did it.  He said you first.  No, you're out of your mind.  I thought he was still wearing a sweater, but he did it.  I have a show to do tonight.  I have to represent.  I don't want that image in your face while I'm doing jokes.  Don't forget one-armed guy.  You need a microphone.  Oh, yeah.  I want to pull his arm and see if chips come out of his mouth.  Oh, my God.  If we applaud him, is that rude? 
[00:28:30]  Oh, my God.  How did that come?  He's a one-off bandit.  That was a good joke.  It's like, look at me and my use of two hands.  That's when you look at him and go, damn, you really lost last night, didn't you?  Yeah, man.  Talk about taking an arm and a leg.  This place is rough when you go over your limit.  Hey, put a mic on him.  Leave a mic on him.  Anyone got a mic?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, man.  Don't.  We don't.  Don't.  What's your name?  Chris.  Hey, what do you do besides not play patty cakes?  I caught a fish how big?  I actually got to see you when you came to the comedy.  Oh, no, Ralph. 
[00:29:00]  You didn't.  No, you didn't.  Jimmy, I actually got to see you when you were out here for the comedy festival.  Great fucking show.  Oh, thank you, man.  Sorry I said that.  You insult him.  You insult him.  How did you applaud?  You banged your head on the chair in front of you?  Oh, my God.  He's the guy swimming in circles in the pool.  What's the matter with you?  Wasn't the fucking slot remark harsh enough?  Jesus.  I know what he does.  He plays marble. 
[00:29:30]  It's just.  Yeah.  Yeah, look, I hope there's no one-armed activists that are going to get us fired.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Jesus.  So much for the merger.  They'd all be late because they have nowhere to wear their watch.  That guy what it deserves because they.  It's only me, one-armed.  Here's why that's bombed because they do have another one.  Something to say.  Okay, hi.  Shut up and play some music.  No.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Wow.  She thought about that for two minutes.  I know. 
[00:30:00]  That's awesome.  Jesus.  That was the best hack of all day.  Can you imagine not just thinking that but actually getting on stage and yelling that  into a microphone?  Wait, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Can we stop talking for a minute until her dignity gets back up off the floor?  Wait a minute.  I was just joking.  Go ahead.  I was just joking.  We know.  That's why you feel so bad.  April Fools.  Wow.  April Fools.  All right. 
[00:30:30]  Can you imagine if that was a dude?  If that was a dude, you would just want to shoot him in the head right now because you know  he'd be fucked for the rest of his life.  No, you're the fool.  You're the fool.  You're the fool.  April Fools.  Just let her go.  Just let her walk away.  Just shut up and play some music.  Hold on a second.  She wants to say something else.  Go ahead.  Just shut up and show your tits.  Hold on.  Right.  Whatever.  I have a cute butt.  All right.  So show it.  Show your tits.  Show your tits.  Show your tits.  Yeah.  Show your tits.  Show your tits.  Rich, are they talking to me? 
[00:31:00]  Show your tits.  I think they're talking to me, Bonnie.  She's not worried about that.  Let's check.  Now, this is the way.  I know.  Show your tits.  Read a book.  You said show some money.  Wait.  She asked for money.  Anthony's not going to say.  She wanted money.  What?  She's got to come to the Spearmint Rhino for that.  Wait a minute.  There's better ones than the Spearmint Rhino.  No, no.  I heard if we go over there, they'll totally have sex with us.  They don't agree.  Everything.  For, like, no money.  Because they all love us. 
[00:31:30]  They're insulting the women.  Good luck censoring them.  All right.  We're going to play.  It's your radio show.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Rich Bost, everyone.  We're going to go drink.  It's not that easy, is it, Pat?  I didn't say it.  All right.  All right.  What are we going to do?  Take a break?  Play some music?  We'll play some music, but we'll be hanging out.  I'm putting this water down and getting started. 
[00:32:00]  We are.  When you're not talking.  Oh, good.  What is Kenny saying?  And we'll be back on.  I want to get you in the shape of your nice cabana.  They got to do a commercial or a vlog or something?  Don't forget that the biggest mixed martial arts event of the year starts tonight at 9 p.m.  Eastern.  It's the Bodogfight.com finale.  Visit Bodogfight.com.  Find out how you can order.  We'll be right back with the ONA press conference right after this.  I was told to talk now. 
[00:32:30]  Hello and welcome to the fabulous Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  For those of you who don't know, my name is Club Soda Kenny, and I'm going to be hosting 
[00:33:00]  the press conference today.  That's all the applause I get.  We're excited to have both XM Satellite Radio and Xtreme 107.5 broadcasting live today.  So let's hear it for them.  And before we get going, let's thank the girls from the Spearmint Rhino for entertaining you 
[00:33:30]  guys today.  That's what I say, too, about those skanks.  But in case anybody's interested, they're also going to be performing tonight at The  Joint, where we kick off the 2007 comedy event of the year, the Opie and Anthony Traveling  Virus Tour.  And in case anybody didn't realize how big and stupid I am, I got to read this with large 
[00:34:00]  font.  After I give you a brief rundown of this year's tour dates and a list of the several comics  that will be participating in this year's tour, I will introduce you to tonight's performers  as well as your hosts for the evening, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:34:30]  Last year's tour broke attendance records for comedy shows at several of the venues and  the festival made stops at.  This year, the tour is hitting more cities with even more comments.  And it's funny to do a press conference with no press here.  Did anybody notice that?  There's a press package going around that lists all the dates, cities, venues and comics who  are already, I got to turn the page, confirmed to participate in the tour. 
[00:35:00]  However, the packet also has a rendering of the tour set design, which means nothing to  you people.  This year's tour is going to be making stops in Jones Beach in Long Island, New York, the  Mohegan Sun Casino in Connecticut, Boston, Massachusetts, Detroit, Michigan, Washington, 
[00:35:30]  D.C., PNC, in Holmdale, New Jersey, and the Tweeter Center in Camden for Philly.  Well, let's applaud.  And the lineup of the comics this year is bigger and better, including the following comics  who are here today.  Mr. Bob Kelly, Mr. Rich Floss, Mr. Joe Rogan, Mr. Ralphie May, Mr. Patrice O'Neill, Otto and 
[00:36:00]  George.  And all these comics are going to be on all the different lineups.  We're going to mix and match between the shows.  So check online for the specific details. 
[00:36:30]  And also, comics that aren't here today, Louis C.K., Stephen Lynch, Bob Saget, and Frank  Caliendo.  Wait, there's a third page with more comics.  Carlos Mencian, Louis Black.  All right, listen, listen, listen. 
[00:37:00]  All right.  All right.  And let's give a big round of applause.  Last but not least, our own Jim Norton.  And now, please welcome none other than Anthony and Opie. 
[00:37:30]  I want to get to say a few words and take some questions.  Oh, thank you.  Bless you.  Bless you.  Is this the beginning of the press conference?  Why officially?  Why did Kenny announce us differently?  That gets me nervous.  A lot of press here.  It's fucking eight fat guys with PalTalk cameras.  Should we ask for questions? 
[00:38:00]  Is that what you do?  There's no press here.  Sir, sir, right there.  What newspaper do you work for?  The Daily Press?  Oh, all right.  I'll be nice to you.  What's the Daily Press?  I have a blog.  I'm writing on my blog.  The Daily Press is probably some anti-Jewish Aryan website.  Well, then he's in the right place. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  So what are we supposed to do?  We really are dumb motherfuckers.  We have no idea how to make an entrance.  You know what?  We'll do a goof press conference.  Does anyone have a question?  I see this guy over here has a question, Danny.  Are you guys going to be returning to Vegas?  Excuse me?  What?  Are you guys going to be returning to Vegas?  Never again.  Yeah.  We hate it here.  Of course.  I have no money left.  Sir, you shouldn't ask if we're returning to Vegas while we're in Vegas before we've done  a show.  That's something you ask like a year after we've been in Vegas.  And you don't have to cup your hands when you're talking into a microphone. 
[00:39:00]  So it's ask a question and be abused.  I see how this is going to go.  This is going to be perfect.  Go ahead, Danny.  Give us another question.  Good afternoon, boys.  I am Big Wave Dave.  Speak up.  Speak up.  Sorry, we're good to hear you.  Sorry.  I am Big Wave Dave from the Point Defiance Express.  We are all very excited to have you guys out here on the West Coast.  I want to know if we can expect to see you guys anywhere else on the West Coast anytime 
[00:39:30]  soon.  First of all, I love your earthquake prediction, thinking this is the West Coast.  Where's the beach, Jack Off?  I do understand we're further West than, oh, the Mississippi.  He wants to go to Cleveland to see the Atlantic.  I don't even remember his question now.  I think this is the farthest West we're going on the tour for now.  Yes, it is. 
[00:40:00]  Maybe.  Where are you from?  Sacramento, I'm thinking?  No, no.  I'm actually from Tacoma, Washington.  Tacoma, Washington?  Hell yeah.  You should.  Well, if you're from England, we'll be in Cleveland.  No, listen.  There is a fantastic collection of West Coast pests.  We see the pest.  Yes.  I want to definitely say hi to the Pest Out West.  The POWs.  Oh, this guy.  Pest Out West.  Pest Out West.  Oh, wow.  Yes.  They got a serious professional banner.  Show the banner to everybody for a photo op. 
[00:40:30]  That is badass.  Get that on stage.  That is badass, dude.  Are any of the pests in southern states here, they're known as piss?  We love those guys, too.  Well, here's Kenny with the banner for a photo op for everybody.  I say we should take a question from the young man from Munchkintown.  Meet Neo, our own pal Neo.  Neo's here, I see.  Yes.  Wow.  Cool. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, give him the mic, eh?  Yo.  We would like to comment on the fact that a house fell on a witch, but we don't want to  get in trouble as of yet.  The witch Americans might be angry with our comments.  We represent.  Yo.  You don't have to do the voice impression.  Visual is just fine.  Come on, scoliosis, ask us something.  Shut up, stupid.  Oh, leave old pretzel body alone.  Go ahead, Neo.  Old hood ornament. 
[00:41:30]  At least there will be no tucks.  Oh, jeez.  This event.  What is that?  I don't know.  Just let it sit, the bomb.  Let your bomb sit there.  This is just like a regular press conference.  We got a wheelchair is bomb out of here.  Along with mine.  All right.  Anyone else with a question?  I believe this gentleman.  Danny, we have a question from this young man here.  Yeah.  Why aren't you guys coming to Chicago this year?  Ah, good question.  Why aren't we?  Aren't we?  We are trying to work out Chicago and maybe another city or two. 
[00:42:00]  We don't know, actually, if we're going to do Chicago or not.  We want to be in Chicago.  I'm sitting here.  What's that?  You're representing Chicago?  I'm representing Chicago.  All right.  Well, thank you, sir.  You're a fine representative.  And I saw you at Zanys, Jimmy, and you kill.  Oh, thank you.  Hey, how about this guy from The Hills Have Eyes behind you?  Brickman of the POWs, fullblownAids.com.  Listen every day on 107.3 Free FM in San Francisco.  Any chance of you guys coming out there next year?  To San Francisco?  Maybe to have sex with you. 
[00:42:30]  I'll say it's a gay joke.  Hey, as long as it's you, it's okay.  Hey, there you go.  It's not gay because it's Anthony.  Now, I made a joke, and I think he's serious.  No homo.  No homo.  There you go.  He said no homo.  I don't know.  I don't even know if we have an audience in San Francisco yet.  That station seems to, like, dump out of a lot of the controversial stuff we do.  Rumor has it, when we're talking, they dump out of half of the stuff we say.  Is that true?  Yeah.  They really do.  Yeah, great.  It's hard to listen to, but I've got to give you the ratings. 
[00:43:00]  How about you get the XM, sir?  I have.  I'm a loyal subscriber for you.  Very good.  Thank you, sir.  Because it's obvious we're going back to XM sooner than later.  Yeah, I think it's going on.  One trip over our own tongue and back to satellite exclusively.  What is Voss saying?  No them.  No them?  No.  See, when you have a mic in front of you, though, everyone can hear you.  What were you saying?  We want the fucking music turned off.  We want it just a little bit lower, not off.  I mean, stop turning.  It's not that distracting.  There are people back there enjoying it. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  Don't be so self-centered.  Fine.  Anybody who enjoys this music, their opinion means nothing.  Smooth music is horrible.  Why don't you take that hat, grab your racing form, and go back to the tracks?  You look like everyone's grandfather with that hat on.  That should be slapping a racing form.  I thought you looked bad at it.  Oh.  I can't believe he did that.  There you go.  Good.  Robert Kelly just threw Voss's hat into the audience.  So the guy has a new hat if he wants it. 
[00:44:00]  That's not going to fit on his head.  Give it back to him.  I got six of them.  Oh.  Come on.  There he goes.  Good man.  Good man.  Bobby.  No.  I ain't giving it back.  In the pool.  In the pool.  In the pool.  In the pool.  In the pool.  In the pool.  Yeah.  That guy might give it back.  No.  Oh.  It's like it.  That's over.  Now you're in the.  I don't give a fuck about Opie and Anthony group. 
[00:44:30]  That's being kicked around like Bobby at the beach.  Some girls just wiped their snatch with it.  It's over now.  A $1,200 hat.  By the way, we have a pair of tickets for tonight's show.  Who doesn't have tickets yet?  A few people.  A few people don't have tickets.  What would you do for O&A Traveling Virus tickets?  Oh.  Ask Danny in the front row.  I just want to say yesterday, Opie.  Yesterday, Norton left me a present in my room.  In the hotel.  Uh-oh.  I went to the bathroom and him and his girl were in my room waiting for me. 
[00:45:00]  And I heard them giggling.  And they ran out of my room.  And I went to go see what they did.  Norton shit in my bucket.  It was a good nine pounds.  I fucking named it.  I have a photo of it.  I'm going to put it on my MySpace.  It's around...  It looks like two figure eights on top of each other.  Hey, Bobby.  Where was Jim Norton's girl when you did that?  Did you get a picture of it?  His girl...  She was staring...  Yeah, I got a picture of it.  She was staring right at him.  I heard them giggling. 
[00:45:30]  I thought they were tickling each other on my bed.  Apparently, he had his pants down.  He was squatting over my barrel taking a shit.  And that makes her giggle.  Yeah.  They made for each other.  She's a lovely German girl.  All right.  Any more questions?  Where's Danny?  Hold on.  Where's Danny?  What's up?  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  The bigger gentleman right there.  Danny, work the media, Danny.  Hey, I'm Zimmer.  ONA Preacher.  I was wondering, are you going to send Bill Burr back to Philly?  Bill has decided not to go to Philly this year. 
[00:46:00]  That is some breaking news right there.  He's decided to take a year off as far as Philly goes.  I just saw Jimmy shit.  Hey, love you guys.  Love the show.  Thanks.  Otto and George, they've got a mic over there.  Love these guys.  They've got anything to say about what's going on today?  Otto and George, ladies and gentlemen.  Otto and George.  Heal Gambles lives in candles.  Thanks for the words of wisdom.  Is this thing on?  It's on. 
[00:46:30]  I can't.  Fucking hot.  Patrice, you got anything to say to this mom?  Fuck no.  What does he have to say?  Patrice is, oh, he's well above this.  He's been on more TV this week than American Idol.  That's what he's going to do.  He's going to be on American Idol next, commenting on nappy-headed hoes.  Well, Sanjaya's hair, I don't like it this week.  It was a little too nappy. 
[00:47:00]  Who else?  Who else has a question?  Ah, great.  Is Doug Stanhope going to be on any of the arms of the tour?  Yeah, we're, uh, I know we're trying to get him.  Yeah, we love Doug.  We put an offer in his Stanhope, but he's on the road a lot and he goes to Europe a lot.  So we would love to get Stanhope on the tour.  There's a couple other comedians we're working on as well.  Got to look into his drug schedule and see if it's conducive to our, uh, tour schedule.  Hey, hold on a second.  All right, go ahead.  Dr. Occupus has a question. 
[00:47:30]  Hey, Patrice, I loved you on the office.  Oh, don't fuck me up, Patrice.  Don't fuck me.  I loved you on the office, man.  When are you going to get more time on the show?  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  I didn't even know it was on.  How was it?  I don't know why he's helped.  Nice politician's answer, you idiot.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I won't.  I was just looking at Pat from Saturday Night Live.  Mr. Morphodite asked me a question.  He's the only office fan here.  I'm sorry. 
[00:48:00]  I don't know, dude.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know, dude, I think.  It's Pat.  Nice.  All right, who else?  Who else has a question?  Well, sir, while you're back there, you have to come a little closer.  And we do have a pair of tickets for tonight's show.  You got to come up and tell us what you would do for the tickets.  There's one guy willing to do something for the tickets.  Great.  All right.  The key is, what will he do for the tickets?  What is he willing to do?  He's an extremely hairy man. 
[00:48:30]  And he's willing to have the hair on his chest ripped off for tickets.  Oh, really?  How are we going to do that?  How would we rip it off?  We could try and do it with, like, wow stickers.  I think some chick ought to just grab a big hold of it and just rip it out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That would be good.  That would be nice.  That would.  Fellas, I'm going to just go out to the people and help Danny out.  He says he's willing to do that, so that's fine.  All right.  Anyone else?  Anyone else?  Wow.  Go out to the people.  Oh, Patrice is going to go to the people. 
[00:49:00]  Go out to the people and ask questions.  Wow.  Who needs questions?  Let him get in.  All right.  Patrice is making his way into the crowd.  Where's questions at?  Here's a question right here.  What's your name?  August.  I'm August.  August from Salt Lake City.  August from nowhere.  Just an insignificant kid that wants a question.  August.  Got a good Mormon question here for you.  All right.  So I believe that I heard them mention that Carlos Mencia is going to be on the tour.  So I wanted some thoughts from Rogan on that.  Ah. 
[00:49:30]  Who gives a shit?  I don't have to watch it.  Woo!  So it's okay to say you don't give a shit, Joe.  Huh?  And your official answer is I don't give a shit.  I couldn't care less.  If you're dumb enough to want to go see that guy, you're not on my team.  We have questions.  All right.  Patrice is working his way around the crowd here.  What's your name, sir?  Ryan.  Ryan who?  From anything special?  Flagstaff, Arizona. 
[00:50:00]  Flagstaff, Arizona.  Ryan from Flagstaff, Arizona.  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  Something I am from Flagstaff.  Flagstaff.  Ryan from Flagstaff, Arizona.  I got a two-part question.  Part for you and part for Anthony.  All right.  What do you guys think as being the only ones that can fucking eloquently represent the First  Amendment?  What would the founding fathers think of you guys being the only ones that can?  How many guns do you have, motherfucker?  Beating and trying to hang me in?  What would you do, Anthony?  I got a survivalist.  Actually...  I know those dudes with fucking ditches in their backyard with ammunition stowed. 
[00:50:30]  That's you, bitch.  Come on, man.  I know you are.  These guys...  If you start citing constitutional amendments, you crackpot.  If we were alive, more than four, right?  How many rifles?  Don't fucking lie.  You got a knife on you right now, motherfucker.  Two more questions.  You got one of those plastic ones you can take to the metal detectors.  All right.  Anthony's got it.  That's all right.  If we were alive during the time of the founding fathers, yes, I would agree with them wholeheartedly  about the freedom of speech, and then send Patrice back out because we need more cotton. 
[00:51:00]  That's what I'm saying to the founding fathers.  What the fuck do I got to do with that shit?  I'm sure there'd be lots of love for Patrice from the founding fathers.  We have a question from the leader of the Nazi lowriders here.  Hey, Anthony.  Yes, sir.  I got a question for you.  Where are you playing poker tonight?  I want to take some of your money.  Oh!  Oh, shit.  Oh, nigga.  Sir.  No, he didn't.  Oh, shit.  No, he didn't. 
[00:51:30]  Sir, if you want to take some of my money, I suggest you go to the bank here in the Hard  Rock and hold it up because I gave him enough last night.  Apparently, no hold'em here.  That's what I'm hearing.  And since we got the show and then we have to run for a plane, I don't really have much  time to play poker, but I like the smack talk and that's good.  I like how you're talking smack.  We have a question from a black man.  We have to be represented.  My brother.  Shit. 
[00:52:00]  Now we ain't got nothing to say.  We have a question.  It ain't women.  Questions.  Questions for many women.  No women?  All right.  One more.  One more, I think.  Patrice, could you get away from the black guy?  Yeah, once two of them get together.  She just didn't have anything to say.  They didn't want to have any.  No controversy.  Once two get together, we all get nervous.  What's your name, Steve?  Patrice, ask Kid Dino Might if he has a question.  Excuse me.  Roger, from What's Happening, do you have any questions at all?  Dwayne is still alive, he said.  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  No.  Jerry? 
[00:52:30]  Sharon.  Sharon has a question from where?  On Tanagan, Michigan.  Michigan.  Sharon from Michigan.  Hi, Michigan.  Can we get Imus on XM?  She wants to know if Imus will be on XM soon.  I don't think Imus is going to be on XM satellite radio anytime soon.  I'm trying to go through a merger, and I'd love to see the protests at the FCC.  Now, take your shirt off, you whore.  Shut up, jerk.  Imus has said he won't work at XM until we fire all the blacks. 
[00:53:00]  Hey, Patrice, one-armed guy says he's got a joke, and he bets he could stump you.  Hey, did we find out how he lost his arm?  I'm from Jersey.  I live out here now, but I was in a car accident.  It was an insurance scam on the West Side Highway.  Jesus.  Oh, wow.  Sorry, man.  It's not even a funny lost my arm story.  You're not a governor, are you?  Yeah, no kidding.  Wow.  I'm better than that guy's doing right now. 
[00:53:30]  It was an insurance scam?  How much did you get?  Oh, it wasn't on your part.  I get it.  Yeah, I can't really go there right now.  Wait, was it your fault, the accident, or no?  No, no, no.  Pending litigation.  Yeah, two cars, but they left.  They didn't stop.  I don't know why the further we think we go, we're going to find funny going.  This is comedy.  I know.  Looking for comedy.  There's nothing funny there.  No.  But if anybody needs tickets, if you either want to have a girl, I can put this in her,  or a guy that wants to look at her.  Man, this guy's, I like the way you think.  The look on his face when he said, I can put this in her. 
[00:54:00]  Put this in her.  Even he wasn't excited about it.  I think he's trying, though.  I wonder.  Wow.  It's a Rodriguez film.  Listen, every day on 107.3 Free FM in San Francisco, any chance of you guys coming  out there next year?  To San Francisco?  Maybe I'm going to have sex with you.  See, it's a gay joke.  Hey, as long as it's you, it's okay.  Hey, there you go.  It's not gay because it's Anthony.  Now, I made a joke, and I think he's serious.  No homo.  No homo.  There you go.  He said no homo.  I don't know.  I don't even know if we have an audience in San Francisco yet. 
[00:54:30]  That station seems to, like, dump out of a lot of the controversial stuff we do.  Rumor has it, when we're talking, they dump out of half of the stuff we say.  Is that true?  Yeah.  They really do.  Yeah, great.  It's hard to listen to, but I've got to give you the ratings.  How about you get the XM, sir?  I have.  I'm a loyal subscriber for you.  Very good.  Thank you, sir.  Because it's obvious we're going back to XM sooner than later.  Yeah, I think it's music going on.  One trip over our own tongue and back to satellite exclusively.  What is Voss saying? 
[00:55:00]  No them.  No them?  No.  See, when you have a mic in front of you, though, everyone can hear you.  What were you saying?  We want the fucking music turned off.  We want it just a little bit lower, not off.  I mean, it's not that distracting.  There are people back there enjoying it.  Yeah.  Don't be so self-centered.  Fine.  Anybody who enjoys this music, their opinion means nothing.  Music is horrible.  Why don't you take that hat, grab your racing form, and go back to the track.  You look like everyone's grandfather with that hat on. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, jeez.  That should be slapping a racing form.  I thought you looked bad.  Oh, I can't believe he did that.  There you go.  Good.  Robert Kelly just threw Voss's hat into the audience.  So, the guy has a new hat if he wants it.  That's not going to fit on his head.  Give it back to him.  I got six of them.  Oh, come on.  Oh, there he goes.  Good man.  Good man.  Bobby.  No, no.  That guy ain't giving it back.  In the pool. 
[00:56:00]  In the pool.  In the pool.  In the pool.  In the pool.  In the pool.  Yeah.  That guy might give it back.  No.  Oh.  It's like it's...  That's over.  Now you're in the...  I don't give a fuck about Opie and Anthony group.  That's being kicked around like Bobby at the beach.  Some girl just wiped her snatch with it.  It's over now.  A $1,200 hat.  By the way, we have a pair of tickets for tonight's show.  Who doesn't have tickets yet?  A few people.  A few people don't have tickets. 
[00:56:30]  What would you do for O&A Traveling Virus tickets?  Oh.  As Danny in the front row.  I just want to say yesterday, Opie, yesterday Norton left me a present in my room.  In the hotel.  Uh-oh.  I went to the bathroom and him and his girl were in my room waiting for me.  And I heard them giggling.  And they ran out of my room and I went to go see what they did.  Norton shit in my bucket.  It was a good nine pound...  I fucking named it.  I have a photo of it. 
[00:57:00]  I'm going to put it on my MySpace.  It's around...  It looks like two figure eights on top of each other.  Hey, Bobby.  Where was two Norton's girls?  Did you get a picture of it?  She was staring...  Yeah, I got a picture of it.  She was staring right at him.  I heard them giggling.  I thought they were tickling each other on my bed.  Apparently, he had his pants down.  He was squatting over my barrel taking a shit.  And that makes her giggle.  They're made for each other.  She's a lovely German girl.  All right.  Any more questions?  Where's Danny? 
[00:57:30]  Hold on.  Where's Danny?  Wait, wait.  Hold on.  The bigger gentleman right there.  Danny, work the media, Danny.  Hey, I'm Zimmer, ONA Preacher.  I was wondering, are you going to send Bill Burr back to Philly?  Bill has decided not to go to Philly this year.  That is some breaking news right there.  He's decided to take a year off as far as Philly goes.  I just saw Jimmy shit.  Hey, love you guys.  Love the show.  Thanks.  I don't enjoy it.  I got a mic over there.  I love these guys.  They got anything to say about what's going on today? 
[00:58:00]  Otto and George, ladies and gentlemen.  Otto and George.  Heal Gambles lives in candles.  Thanks for the words of wisdom.  Is this thing on?  It's hot.  I can't.  Fucking hot.  Patrice, you got anything to say to this mob?  Fuck no.  What does he have to say?  Patrice, he's well above this. 
[00:58:30]  He's been on more TV this week than American Idol.  He's going to be on American Idol next, commenting on nappy-headed hoes.  Well, Sanjaya's hair, I don't like it.  This week, it was a little too nappy.  Who else?  Who else has a question?  Ah, great.  Is Doug Stanhope going to be on any of the arms of the tour?  Yeah, we're, I know we're trying to get him.  Yeah, we'd love Doug.  We put an offer in his Stanhope, but he's on the road a lot and he goes to Europe a lot. 
[00:59:00]  So, we would love to get Stanhope on the tour.  There's a couple other comedians we're working on as well.  Got to look into his drug schedule and see if it's conducive to our tour schedule.  Hey, hold on a second.  All right, go ahead.  Dr. Occupus has a question.  Hey, Patrice, I loved you on the office.  Oh, don't fuck me, Patrice.  Don't fuck me.  I loved you on the office, man.  When are you going to get more time on the show?  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  I didn't even know it was on.  How was it?  I don't know why he's helped. 
[00:59:30]  Nice politician's answer, you idiot.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  I was just looking at Pat from Saturday Night Live.  Mr. Amorfordite asked me a question.  He's the only office fan here.  I'm sorry.  Mr. Amorfordite.  Pat dolls.  I don't know, dude.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know, dude, I think.  It's Pat.  Nice.  All right, who else?  Who else has a question?  Well, sir, while you're back there, you have to come a little closer. 
[01:00:00]  And we do have a pair of tickets for tonight's show.  You've got to come up and tell us what you would do for the tickets.  There's one guy willing to do something for the tickets.  Great.  All right.  The key is, what will he do for the tickets?  What is he willing to do?  He's an extremely hairy man, and he's willing to have the hair on his chest ripped off for tickets.  Oh, really?  How are we going to do that?  How would we rip it off?  Or do we try and do it with, like, wow stickers or?  I think some chick ought to just grab a big hold of it and just rip it out. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That'd be good.  That'd be nice.  That would.  Fellas, I'm going to just go out to the people and help Danny out.  He says he's willing to do that, so that's fine.  All right.  Anyone else?  Anyone else?  Wow.  Go out to the people.  Oh, Patrice is going to go to the people.  Go out to the people and ask questions.  Wow.  Who needs questions?  I'm glad to get in there.  All right.  Patrice is making his way into the crowd.  Where's questions at?  Here's a question right here.  What's your name?  August.  I'm not.  I'm not.  August from Salt Lake City. 
[01:01:00]  August from nowhere.  Instant.  Just an insignificant kid that wants a question.  August.  Got a good Mormon question here for you.  All right.  So I believe that I heard them mention that Carlos Mencia is going to be on the tour.  So I wanted some thoughts from Rogan on that.  Ah.  Who gives a shit?  I don't have to watch it.  Woo!  So it's a thing to say you don't give a shit, Joe.  Huh?  And your official answer is I don't give a shit.  I couldn't care less.  If you're dumb enough to want to go see that guy, you're not on my team. 
[01:01:30]  We have questions.  All right.  Patrice is working his way around the crowd here.  What's your name, sir?  Brian.  Brian who?  From anything special?  Flagstaff, Arizona.  Flagstaff, Arizona.  Brian from Flagstaff, Arizona.  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  Some iron from Flagstaff.  Flagstaff.  Brian from Flagstaff, Arizona.  I got a two-part question.  Part for you and part for Anthony.  All right.  What do you guys think as being the only ones that can fucking eloquently represent the First Amendment? 
[01:02:00]  What would the founding fathers think of you guys being the only ones that can...  How many guns do you have, motherfucker?  Well, after they stop beating and trying to hang in, what would you do, Anthony?  Survivalists.  I know those dudes with fucking ditches in their backyard with an ammunition stowed.  That's you, bitch.  Come on, man.  I know you are.  These guys...  If you start citing constitutional amendments, you crackpot.  If we were alive...  How many rifles?  More than four, right?  How many rifles?  Don't fucking lie. 
[01:02:30]  You got a knife on you right now, motherfucker.  Two more questions.  You got one of those plastic ones you can take through the metal detectors.  All right.  Anthony's got it.  That's all right.  If we were alive during the time of the founding fathers, yes, I would agree with them wholeheartedly  about the freedom of speech and then send Patrice back out because we need more cotton.  That's what I'm saying to the founding fathers.  What the fuck do I got to do with that shit?  I'm sure there'd be lots of love for Patrice from the founding fathers.  We have a question from the leader of the Nazi lowriders here. 
[01:03:00]  Hey, Anthony.  Yes, sir.  I got a question for you.  Why are you playing poker tonight?  I want to take some of your money.  Oh!  Oh, shit!  Oh, nigga!  Sir?  No, he didn't!  Oh, shit!  No, he didn't!  Sir, if you want to take some of my money, I suggest...  Wait a minute.  Anybody black?  I suggest you go to the bank here in the Hard Rock and hold it up because I gave him enough  last night.  Apparently, no hold'em here.  That's what I'm hearing.  And since we got the show and then we have to run for a plane, I don't really have much 
[01:03:30]  time to play poker, but I like the smack talking.  That's good.  I like how you're talking smack.  We have a question from a black man.  We have to be representing...  My brother.  Shit.  Now we ain't got nothing to say.  We have a question.  It ain't women.  Questions.  Questions from many women.  No women?  All right.  One more.  One more, I think.  Patrice, could you get away from the black guy?  Once two of them get together.  He just didn't have anything to say.  They didn't want to have...  No controversy.  Once two get together, we all get nervous. 
[01:04:00]  What's your name, Steve?  Patrice, ask Kid Dino Might if he has a question.  Excuse me.  Roger, from What's Happening, do you have any questions at all?  Dwayne is still alive, he said.  Hi.  Hi.  No.  Jerry?  Sharon.  Sharon has a question from where?  Antonaga, Michigan.  Michigan.  Sharon from Michigan.  Hi, see you again.  Can we get Imus on XM?  She wants to know if Imus will be on XM soon.  I don't think Imus is going to be on XM Satellite Radio anytime soon. 
[01:04:30]  Trying to go through a merger, and I'd love to see the protests at the FCC.  Now, take your shirt off, you whore.  No, shut up, jerk.  Imus has said he won't work at XM until we fire all the blacks.  Hey, Patrice, one-armed guy says he's got a joke, and he bets he can stump you.  And did we find out how he lost his arm?

I don't know why the further we think we go, we're going to find funny going.  I know. 
[01:05:30]  Looking for comedy.  There's nothing funny there.  But if anybody needs tickets, if you either want to have a girl, I can put this in her,  or a guy that wants to lick it.  Man, this guy's, I like the way you think.  The look on his face when he said, I can put this in her.  Put this in her.  Even he wasn't excited about it.  I think he's trying, though, one or two times.  It's a Regish film.  Hey, we got the guy that's willing to get his hair ripped out by a chick for tickets for  tonight's show.  Let's see how hairy it is.  By the way, where's all the info for the... 
[01:06:00]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, man.  Jesus, dude, your check there's wet.  You're sweating.  I want a stripper.  I want a stripper.  That's George the Animal Steel.  The one in the strawberries.  Did you see her?  Oh, my God.  Hey, hey.  Wow.  All right.  This could be a...  It's the guy that beat up...  I guess it's very important to comment.  Oh, hold on.  Patrice has a comment in the back.  Yes, sir.  This is breaking news, Jack.  Yes.  What's your name?  Jojo 50.  Jojo 50, guys.  Breaking news.  The Pests are organizing a protest against NBC in New York City at 6.30 Monday morning. 
[01:06:30]  Everybody be there.  Woo!  Well, uh...  Sound like it's going to be packed.  Sounds a little early, fucker.  Hey, uh...  Way to rally the troops, Ben Franklin.  I thought you'd do some shit at 2 in the afternoon.  Hey, listen.  They said, can they do it at 3.15 in the afternoon instead?  You lazy bastard.  Hey, uh...  Check out the hairy guy on stage.  Yeah, that's...  What's your name, sir?  I'm Chaz.  All right, Chaz.  And you're willing to have someone just rip the chest hair out?  Oh, yeah.  Why did you beat up Linderman and take his motorcycle? 
[01:07:00]  Wow.  A My Bodyguard joke.  Why is he the most dangerous fighter in the longest yard?  He looks like a Kia Arian.  Wow, I can't believe this is going to happen.  I'm Jewish.  How can I be Arian?  I'm Jewish.  Ah.  How can I know?  Can't tell.  All right, so the king and I is going to have chest hairs pulled out.  I can't wait. 
[01:07:30]  All right.  Shall we dance?  All right.  We're going duct tape.  All right.  Going duct tape.  Duct tape.  You know what it is, though?  He's so sweaty.  I don't think...  You're right.  I don't think it's going to hold.  She's going to say she's got to use the bare hands on something.  He's so sweaty.  Yeah, watch.  Watch how this won't work.  Yeah, this ain't working.  This should have been done a long time ago.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, hey.  See, it didn't work.  He's too sweaty.  I don't have hair.  Wow.  That wasn't good enough.  I can get more hair from my balls with a light combing. 
[01:08:00]  Have you seen my balls?  Grab a mitt full of hair.  Why is that guy looking at my balls?  That was nothing.  I'm not impressed.  Enough with the tape.  Stick a little bit on, but leave a little bit off.  I think we've got to go hands, darling.  Put like a nice long piece.  There you go.  We've got to get a claw in there like he fucked your sister.  She won't listen.  Can someone give her a black eye?  She won't listen.  What do you want me to do?  Just pay attention.  Grab the tape.  No, no, no, no, no.  Grab more tape.  More tape, madam.  Grab a nice hunk.  Big, long, long, long, long.  Right there. 
[01:08:30]  Pull it off.  Now, put it over your mouth.  Now, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Stay right there.  Hold this right there.  I got it.  It's not sticky enough.  This tape stinks.  No, it ain't happening.  The tape doesn't stink.  I said it.  He's sweating.  You dumbass.  No?  No, boss, that ain't going to work out either.  She's got to take her bare hair.  He has oil on his chest to eat.  Look.  Here's what you do.  Get a handful.  Now, now, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Take that piece of tape off.  Take a piece of tape off. 
[01:09:00]  Wait a minute.  Someone get behind him.  He might back up on instinct.  Now, we want you to...  Look out, yeah.  We want you to...  All right, hold it.  I need this woman's attention here.  Hold on.  Who's tapping me?  That might be better.  Oh.  Here we go.  What you're going to do is grab a handful of the chest hair right in the middle.  Don't pull yet.  Don't pull.  Just grab a good handful.  And scream rape.  And when we count to three, you pull it.  Keep your hand in a tight fist and just yank it out of his chest, okay?  Holy shit.  I've got to get a look at this. 
[01:09:30]  I had a good handful.  Let me see.  Turn this way.  Let me get a look.  I want to make sure...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't you want to do a topless, too, or what?  Well, that would be nice.  That's kind of a plus.  What the hell?  How easy was that?  There you go.  Wow.  Convenient.  Wow stickers on there.  All right.  Now, make sure...  Don't be shy and open your hands now.  I want that fist clenched like the picture of that fist that was in that alligator's mouth.  Just completely closed.  All right.  You ready?  Are you ready, sir?  Oh, yeah.  I want to see some hair in that hand. 
[01:10:00]  Let's go, baby.  Should we hold the guy down?  Yeah.  You know what?  Someone hold the guy down.  Hold on a second.  All right.  Hold him down, Rogan.  Yeah, Rogan, put him in a chokehold.  That's good.  Choke him out, Rogan.  Just make believe he's Mencia.  No, don't kill him.  No, you're going to get him killed.  All right.  Ready?  One, two, three.  Obama!  Oh, shit.  She's got roots in her hands.  It's very oily.  They're not happy.  This is the best I can do, baby.  She did get some hairs in there.  Can I do it?  Can I do it?  All right. 
[01:10:30]  Let a guy do it.  Let me do it.  Let me do it.  Let me do it.  Let me do it.  Can I do it?  Bob wants to do it.  Bob Kelly, take your meaty paws.  Let's hear it for Bob Kelly.  Here we go.  Get a big man paws.  It's just like some dude's pubes.  Yeah.  Little geeks.  Hold that.  Damn it.  Take your watch off of everything.  Bobby, you want us to build a rest area around you?  Yeah.  I'm just going to pretend he's my uncle.  Bob's used to having to pick up a ball bag before he does this.  Go righty.  You've got to want to go righty on this.  Yeah.  Don't go southpaw.  Go righty.  Get a good.  Yeah.  There you go. 
[01:11:00]  Ready?  One, two, three.  Oh!  Sounded like Velcro.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Oh, damn.  Oh, man.  Wow.  That was so gross.  That'll wake you up in the morning.  Holy shit.  That sounded like Velcro.  One more time.  No, no, no.  One more time.  One more time.  Oh, my God.  He's got to have sat right down.  One more time.  No resistance at all. 
[01:11:30]  We're all going to be in the practice club after this.  Oh, shut up about an infection.  Infection.  From his back.  Yeah.  We're going to go for the back.  Oh, fuck.  We're going for the back.  His chest is lit up.  Yeah, it's totally right now.  It's lit up.  All right.  Fluff that hair up.  There you go.  Wait a minute.  Bobby's always been a good fluffer.  Wait, Bobby, get on mic.  What?  It's going to be better than the chest is up.  Remember, these fucking very shoulder blades.  You can't really get a good grip, though.  Are you sure he's not turning into a wolf as we speak? 
[01:12:00]  He's thinking about getting cornrows.  Anybody can do cornrows?  All right.  Just turn around.  I'm going to rip this stuff in.  All right.  Are you going to do the back?  Right here or right here?  I think you're right at the back.  Up there.  Up there.  Oh.  Does anybody have, like, a brush?  I want to get it up fluffy.  Get it.  Get a pick.  All right, Bob.  Good.  You've got one nappy neck toe over there.  You're not going to be able to get a good grip there, dude.  Can you?  Can you get a good one?  Bobby, don't eat it afterwards.  All right.  You ready?  You got a good grip, Bobby?  Hang on.  Hang on.  I got to. 
[01:12:30]  This is like arm wrestling.  You have to wait.  Yeah.  Get the right grip.  Now, if you can't get a good grip, don't be shy.  Let us know and go for the chest.  You got to go with the chest, bro.  I get the back.  I get the back.  Rip the skin off it.  Ready?  One.  Two.  Three.  Three.  Oh.  No.  Yes.  I love the sound it makes.  Look at his back.  How ready.  We're going steady.  Look at that.  Yes.  I should.  I really.  Honest to God, if you really want to get the tickets, it should be from one of his fucking  man tits.  How about his fucking man? 
[01:13:00]  Are you saying you want to do it one more time, Bob?  I just think, you know, back and getting one more time.  I think that's tough just to the side of his nipple.  Just to the side.  Right there.  See that tough right there.  Right here.  Right here.  How about this?  You pull it out with your teeth.  No.  He has baby oil or some fucking cream on his tit.  I'm not putting it in my mouth.  How about his pubes?  Grab some pubes.  Yeah, nice talking to you.  Here we go.  Ready?  Right here we go.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  The baby oil is what's freaking you out?  Not the fact that it's a guy's tit? 
[01:13:30]  I thought you were ripping from that before.  It's a baby oil on his tit.  I'm not putting it in my mouth.  I don't want to.  I'm allergic, Joe.  I don't want to.  Oh, you're allergic to baby oil?  Hey, dude.  You ready?  Bobby, hold up.  Somebody.  This guy said take tape.  Pinch the tape in between the hair and pull it off.  It slips, the tape sticks.  Watch this.  You ready?  How about we get a knife?  All right, Bobby.  Here we go.  Oh, shit.  You have a good hold.  This is for the tickets for tonight's show.  Get a good hold, a good tump. 
[01:14:00]  Here we go.  I got it.  I got my grip.  Get that mic on here.  Everyone just listen to the sound it makes.  One, two, three.  Watch, watch.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Holy shit.  I used my jerk off hand, too.  Let me see.  Where's the patch?  Wow, he is turning red, man.  Hey, sir, here's a pair of tickets for tonight's show. 
[01:14:30]  Hell, yeah.  Let's hear it for this guy.  Let's hear it for him.  Good job.  Holy shit.  Wow.  That's not right, man.  Oh, wait, sir, sir.  Here's a bumper sticker to cover up that patch of hair that's missing.  Damn.  Look at his back, too.  It's all red.  Nice.  God, that sound was really painful, man.  I think we're going to wrap this up.  Really?  We're having so much fun.  By the way, let's hear it for Frank Caliendo. 
[01:15:00]  He's playing tonight.  Frank.  He's doing a bunch of dates for us on the ONH Alvin Virus Comedy Tour.  Frank Caliendo.  Hey, here's a guy doing a voice.  Boom.  I don't have anything to say, so then I just go on and hope you laugh.  Phenomenal.  You want me to do more?  Oh, here we go.  Let's play along.  Come on, every dancer.  We're back.  Okay, what's going on?  I don't even know.  I was thinking Bush, actually.  Okay, guys.  A little Bush.  It is great that you're all here, getting tankified, make sure nobody dies before the 
[01:15:30]  show, and that's it.  Frank Caliendo.  Pretty amazing.  All right, man.  All right, I guess we're wrapping up there.  You're the real guy. 
[01:16:00]  Hey, help me.  Oh, Andy.  Yes, yes, Pest.  We're going to meet and greet after the show.  Oh, my God.  They're all screaming.  We're going to do a meet and greet after the show.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Yes, we won't sign any pictures or talk to anybody, but you can look at us.  And you can also get my DVD at Amazon.com.  Oh, cheap, poor plug.  Bonnie's loving the plug, though.  Yeah, she loved the plug a few months ago.  It made her pregnant.  All right, we've got to wrap up.  I guess the comedy tour, all the info's up on our website, opiananthony.com. 
[01:16:30]  Tickets go on sale.  It looks like what?  Did we actually announce the dates?  Sort of.  Did we actually do what we were supposed to do and announce the dates?  There's a guy with Rich's hat.  I don't think he knows his Rich's hat.  He just picked it up and put it on.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  That hat belongs on one of those Georgia kids.  Yeah, I sunburned very easily.  I'm eight years old with the body of a 92-year-old, so I could burn my skull and my brain.  Who is that?  That's the guy from Platoon. 
[01:17:00]  What are you saving up to me, Lieutenant George?  All right.  I've got a bad feeling about this, L.T.  All right, here's the deal.  We've got the dates, and the city's all on the website.  Tickets go on sale Friday through ticketmaster.com.  Very good.  That's it.  What an exciting way to end.  Looking forward to seeing everybody here tonight at the show.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And after all...  O-A-N-A!  O-A-N-A!  O-A-N-A! 
[01:17:30]  O-A-N-A!  O-A-N-A!  O-A-N-A!  Don't cry for me.  O-A-N-A!  O-A-N-A!  Yes!  And we'll see you at the show, and then afterwards, you Degenerates, how many of you gamble?  All of them.  See you at the table, man.  And the Pest Out West, thanks for coming out.  We know what you're all about.  All right, guys, we're off the radio.  Is Voss going to be back on the radio later tonight, though?  Don, what's going on for the rest of the broadcast today?  We're going backstage.  We're going backstage a little bit later on tonight. 
[01:18:00]  All right, keep 202 on all night long.  We're going to have some live updates from Rich Voss backstage.  Thank you, guys.  All right, we're in the middle of the Opie and Anthony Vegas broadcast.  Easy for you to say.  Oh, slash Stan Sam hosting worst of thing. 
[01:18:30]  We're going to try to throw it right now to Vegas, where Rich Voss and Bonnie McFarlane  are hopefully standing by and go.  Hey, thanks.  We are standing by.  You know, just even that tiny little bit, Rich, and I always feel insecure that we're not  doing a good enough job, but just listening to them for that little tiny bit really, it  boosted my ego, like, unbelievably.  You know, it's so funny, because everybody thinks, we're sending in the air like there's  a storm.  We're in the dressing room with nobody.  Because me... 
[01:19:00]  You can feel the excitement of the show.  Maybe again.  When the guy delivered coffee, I was excited.  I go, I wanted to interview the guy delivering coffee.  That's how bad it is in the dressing room right now.  People think, oh, entertainment, it's so wild.  It's crazy.  The dressing rooms, the girls.  There is absolutely nothing.  Well, my friend Lynn Shawcroft is here.  We do have a girl.  She's a comic.  A girl.  Here's the thing.  The dressing rooms are nothing but comics having anxiety attacks before they go on stage.  They get off, they go, whew, I got through that one, you know. 
[01:19:30]  And then it's cool, but just nothing exciting.  Has there ever been a knife fight or a gun fight at an O&A show?  What's the word?  Are you going to get scared of a little heckling or booing?  I mean...  Well, you don't get scared.  Because when they yell boo to me, I don't know if they're going boo or Jew.  So I'm not really sure what they're yelling at me.  This is how...  I just changed.  I made my nickname boo.  So now when they do it to me, I think they're chanting.  Here's the thing.  We're in Vegas.  We're getting to kick off the big tour, right? 
[01:20:00]  The kickoff show.  Vegas, you know, the wildest city in the country.  All my comics, every friend.  We went out.  We did a show by the pool, which we'll get into in a second.  We go eat.  I go back to my room.  And what do I do?  I go to the message board.  I go to the message board to see what they said about the pool show.  You did?  That's how low my self-esteem is.  What did they say?  Oh, they must have trashed us.  What did they say?  No, there was two people.  Well, basically, they attacked Ralphie, which they should have.  Why did they attack Ralphie?  He was actually very funny. 
[01:20:30]  Ralphie, well, he had some good lines.  One guy said, Vossi are very funny.  I don't know.  And one guy said, you know, Bonnie Rich, maybe you should prepare before you do these things.  We, I, first of all, I only just found out literally that I was doing it maybe moments before going on.  I just lied to make myself feel better.  Yeah, like we never communicate.  Like, Bonnie, your flight is being paid out here.  Why?  Just to sit and look pregnant.  So, so, so, we did prepare. 
[01:21:00]  We had a bunch of stuff we wanted to do.  We were going to have some dumb contests.  Well, first of all, we didn't know that it was going to be broadcast all over the casino and all over the pool where there's all these, like, hot bodies in the pool that are listening to music right before we go on.  And it seemed so inappropriate to cut their music and, hey, welcome to some talk radio.  We're going to be dirty and filthy and offend you.  It's funny.  Some people save up all year to go on their vacation to Las Vegas.  Right.  They're a big dream. 
[01:21:30]  You know, they get in shape.  They don't eat carbs for 10 months.  They buy an $80 bikini.  They're cut to the, they're cut like razors.  We're going to go to Vegas.  We can't wait to get to the pool.  We're going to dance under the huts.  It's a beautiful day.  It was very hot.  We're going to, we're going to hit on girls and meet girls or girls are going to meet guys.  Right.  And then all of a sudden the dumb radio talk show slugs cut our music.  Who are these people?  Who are they?  Who are these mutants?  There's a pregnant chick, a Jew, and an enormous fat guy. 
[01:22:00]  Like it's like all of a sudden it's like some circus is happening.  Yeah.  Circuit, circus moved to the, moved to the hard rock.  This was the hippest casino in town.  We have a married, sober 50-year-old man, a pregnant lady, and a buffet molester sitting there.  And, and here's, here's the thing.  And the audience all look like they were like, uh, uh, from, what are they, what are they, trench coat people?  You know, there was a guy out there today with a, with a black long sleeve shirt and a black leather coat wearing it. 
[01:22:30]  It's 85 degrees in the sun.  I know when you first described it, I thought you meant he was carrying it.  I'm glad you said he was wearing it.  Thank you.  You know what I, yeah, that's a good point.  Oh, aren't they just giggling back home?  Aren't they just giggling in the, uh, old New York?  There's going to be a big storm there.  Uh, there's a storm here.  Whenever I talk into the mic, it's almost a lot.  Hey, look, one of the promoters of the show is here.  Maybe we can talk to him.  We can't talk.  We can't.  Jeff.  But Jeff, you know what?  Jeff is the biggest promoter in the country. 
[01:23:00]  Last time we saw him, he, uh, he walked out.  There's no reason to talk about him.  All right?  Enough of kissing his ass.  We don't even.  Jesus Christ.  The last time I talked about him was the shitty money he gives me.  Uh, oh, come on in, Jeff.  We love you.  What a jerk.  So, so we're at the pool, but it ended up being such a cool thing at the pool when  O&A came down.  And I.  The fans were actually awesome.  It made, you know, the, actually like the, those hot bodies, those dumb cliches that were 
[01:23:30]  out at the pool.  Yeah.  Compared to the fans.  Um, if you, if you didn't mind the way that the fans looked, they made me feel so much  better about being.  Cause you know what the difference is?  The fans, they're comedy fans too.  They get it.  They booed the strippers.  That's what they love.  Come on.  You gotta love that.  That's true.  They booed this.  And the girl came up, turned the music on.  She had like no upper lip and they just, everybody just stared at her.  And you know, it's just, she brought, and the fans are like. 
[01:24:00]  Well, the fans, to be fair, they were staring at her because they, a lot of them haven't  been that close to a real woman.  So, uh, was a novelty for them.  But, but the fans, you know, it is, they, they know everything.  They ripped it.  Bobby is just so funny.  He ripped that guy's hair out.  It was chest.  Uh, now it seemed painful.  And the guys at the pool go, we have to pay to get our chest waxed.  Why can't we just go on stage and have that?  Yeah.  They would prefer to have Bobby pulling the hairs out.  Okay.  I just ad libbed that. 
[01:24:30]  So far.  See folks, this segment right now isn't bad and we didn't prepare this either.  They just threw mics.  This is how laid back this is.  You know what?  Here's some mics.  Try to do a show.  What's that?  Who's on the show today?  Who's on the show?  Oh, everybody that's listening to those who's on the show.  Tell the eight people.  Well, Rich Voss is going to, uh, open up the show at, uh, eight o'clock.  I'm going to host the first half.  Hosting the first half.  Otto and George is the first to come out.  Um, then Ralphie May, then Bob Kelly, then Patrice O'Neill.  Great first half. 
[01:25:00]  Great first half.  Oh.  Then there's a intermission for 20 minutes.  And that's when I go sell my DVDs.  And, uh, get that in there.  Um, then Opie and Anthony are going to make their big, uh.  That's when they come out.  Big entrance.  That's a big, big, big deal.  Then, uh, Frank Caliendo, Jim Norton, and Joe Rogan.  And then someone called Curtain Call.  I don't know who that is.  That's a surprise.  Surprise.  Surprise guest.  You know what's funny?  You read all of those names to get to that, that punchline.  I only made up the punchline as I got there. 
[01:25:30]  I didn't have that planned in advance.  Because that was, that was very good.  I'm going to use that next time when you're not here.  Uh, it's a powerful show.  It's a good showroom, I guess.  Uh, I've never worked this one.  I've worked a couple places in Vegas.  You know, we've done some of the other shows.  Well, this isn't like a real, like a Vegas show.  If you do like a, one of these casinos and you do stand up and you're getting, it's a weird audience.  Because you're getting people from all over the country that a lot of them have never seen comedy before.  And what happened?  We went to see Cirque du Soleil or something.  I started Cirque du Soleil.  And I was in the back going, oh my God, look how young she is. 
[01:26:00]  Like these people are.  I started yelling.  Then everyone was leaving.  Have you ever seen Cirque du Soleil?  It's crazy.  It's like the, your brain, my whole, my, the whole time I was watching it, my brain was  trying to figure out how many people were involved.  When the floor came up and the water went down and it was, it was insane.  And it was pretty amazing.  And afterwards, everyone was walking out going, that was amazing.  That was amazing.  And Rich and I were going, well, that was all right.  Please.  Very good.  Please.  They got 14 year old Romanians, Romanian slaves. 
[01:26:30]  Is that what they're called?  Romanian from Romania.  That's close enough.  Sure.  I'll take that.  We're going to accept that.  I got pre-show anxiety too right now.  You do?  Yeah, you always.  But you do great every time you go out and.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  You do crowd work in a, in a, in a huge auditorium.  Auditorium.  Yes.  We're now at a school, the hard rock school.  Well, the kids, this is, it is like an auditorium and it's just a bunch of kids from the AV squad 
[01:27:00]  in the audience, audio visual aid squad.  See, now we're starting to, Mark, and now I'm starting to tank it.  It started off good.  What happens?  You know what happens?  We don't have any other comics up here.  Well, okay.  We can talk to them.  No, on the, on the, we have a Lynn, but Lynn's, here's the thing.  And here's the thing.  We have Lynn Shawcroft.  Lynn Shawcroft.  Who?  She's a great comic in her own right.  She's traveled all around the country.  She used to travel with her husband, Mitch Heberg. 
[01:27:30]  And she doesn't have a microphone, so she can't comment on any of this.  Oh, hold on.  We have technical difficulties.  Here's the thing.  She has, that one joke of hers I want so bad.  What joke is it?  When you, what's the joke she does when you're sleeping?  When you're sleeping and you're kind of like half asleep.  Do your joke.  Oh, you don't have a microphone.  Come sit in and share Bonnie's mic real quick.  It's such a funny joke. 
[01:28:00]  Hello.  Don't worry about the joke, but what I'm saying is any joke.  It's so loud.  Oh, my God.  My ears.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  Bonnie just lost the baby.  I just had a miscarriage.  Well, I'm free.  Oh, we are running a contest that reminds me where if you name the baby, you will give  you the afterbirth.  So that's the contest that we're running now.  If you.  The placento.  Rich, are you going to be in the delivery room? 
[01:28:30]  Did you call it the placento?  Well, I don't know what it's called.  Okay.  We'll let that slide.  Spanish for placenta.  It's the male placenta.  It's the placenta or whatever.  I don't know.  Jesus.  What's that joke that you do about when you're half asleep?  I can't talk.  I can't do a joke.  But what I'm saying is you can have the joke for five CDs.  Did your CDs show up?  Rich Boss was worried because the CDs were interrupted.  Did they come?  DVDs.  I can have the joke for what?  DVDs.  Five DVDs.  For five DVDs?  Yes.  He'll give you a box of DVDs. 
[01:29:00]  That joke is so funny.  It's like when you're half asleep.  How does it go, Bonnie?  I don't know.  It's something like when you wake up.  When you wake up in the middle of the night, you don't know where you are, and you're kind  of like in that thing, and you see something in your room, and you're like, is that an  old salty sailor in my closet?  Why?  Why is a unicorn playing blackjack?  Is that a circus family?  At the end of my bed, but really it's like your toothbrush or something like that.  Why is your toothbrush at the end of your bed, Liv?  Listen, I've got a sink there, too. 
[01:29:30]  Did you and Mitch do Vegas when he was on the road?  Yeah, he did it.  Mandalay Bay at the House of Blues.  I think my mic is still too hot.  Okay.  You know what?  You guys continue.  I'd just like to listen to you.  No, no, no, but I want to ask you a couple of questions, because now when he did Mandalay  Bay, he did the big room.  The House of Blues.  The House of Blues.  Yeah.  Right?  And obviously he was a big draw.  And did you open for him in that one?  No.  He was a big draw, didn't he?  Yeah.  He was on tour with Lynch then, right?  He went on tour.  He did it once with Lynch, but he also did it with Louis Black and Dave Attell.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's a great tour too, huh? 
[01:30:00]  Louis Black Attell and Mitch.  It was really good.  Who closed that show?  Louis and Dave would change it up.  But Mitch used to pretend to be a stalker for Louis Black, and he'd leave notes in the  the green room vegetables, like, Louis, I love you.  But Louis really believed it, that he had a stalker completely on tour.  I could see him getting crazy about it.  Mitch kept saying, like, really?  I keep talking with a stalker and no one else has seen it but me.  You know what I mean?  So Mitch would leave all these little notes, and Louis was possessed by it. 
[01:30:30]  And when you guys went on the road, you guys bought a camper.  You had like a camper, right?  We liked to call it a recreational vehicle.  Okay.  A camper, recreational vehicle, whatever.  And you would go from city to city, right?  Yeah.  Well, we got a camper, the first one was a camper because it was $1,000, and we drove  that, and it was a piece of crap.  And then we bought a really nice one later on that was really nice.  I have a funny joke about that.  Do that joke.  Come on.  Because you're crazy.  Well, you're a comic, you've got a mic, so if we set you up for a joke.  Well, we used to drive in this really old crappy motorhome, but it was cool because 
[01:31:00]  if it broke down, we were like at home already.  See, you know what it is?  When you tell the audience that she has a joke, and then they do it, sometimes it might  not work.  I didn't know how to mime to her.  Yeah.  That's the setup to the joke.  What was your favorite, when you guys were on tour, favorite club, San Francisco?  Houston, Texas.  There's a place called The Last Stop.  Do your last stop joke.  Okay, but there used to be this club in Dayton, Ohio.  Have you ever been to Jokers in Dayton, Ohio?  No.  It's a great club, but in the lobby, the owners sell sex toys. 
[01:31:30]  No way.  Yes.  Why would he sell, at a comedy club?  I don't know.  Like, have you ever gone to see a show and went, that guy is so funny?  Hey, I need to get a dildo.  Do you have anything that vibrates?  Oh my God.  I need Rich Voss to sign this.  I laugh so hard, I need a fist in my ass.  Do you have gel?  Do you have any gel?  It was weird, it was weird, it was weird.  So, see, because when we travel, there's so many clubs, you know, like, we love San Francisco.  Right.  Chicago was great when we were in Chicago, both clubs. 
[01:32:00]  You guys were just at the improv out in Chicago.  Lynn, Lynn, don't tell people where we were.  Tell people where we're going.  Oh yeah, we're at the improv next week in Fort Lauderdale.  Have you guys ever been kicked out of a club together, like, band?  Well, we've had some moments where we, you know, we called the woman a cunt once.  No, not we.  Okay, I called the woman a cunt once as we were leaving.  But, um, no, because she wouldn't pay.  This was a story where she wouldn't pay us what we.  The club was in Reddington, Pennsylvania.  And we were agreed to be paid this amount of money or whatever. 
[01:32:30]  And it was a long story, but she didn't pay us the right amount of money.  And she was a C-word.  I guess I could say cunt, right?  I already said it.  And, um, so, whatever, we had this big fight.  But then when we got in the car and counted the money, she did accidentally pay us the  right amount of money.  Like, when she handed us the money, she goes, you're only getting this much.  So she's a dumb cunt.  Yeah, exactly.  And we told this story last night on the radio.  She's a carver cunt.  But, you know, we've gotten screwed on door deals.  But just closely, obviously, Caroline's is our favorite. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Punchline, San Francisco.  You guys have to do that.  You know, the Fort Lauderdale improv next week.  We love that.  Next week, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Is that also on a card rock?  Is that a good?  Yeah, we're at the hard rock next week.  The hard rock there, where Anna Nicole died.  Exactly.  And I'm sure I will, too.  You don't have access to those kind of drugs.  Here's the thing.  It's so different.  Is it?  No, is it Larry Burkhead, your real father?  Oh, actually, I just found out.  I'm kind of celebrating tonight because I just found out that Larry Burkhead's my real father.  I just found out that Larry Burkhead's my real father.  I'm the worst that are up for it. 
[01:33:30]  I'm sorry.  But didn't something go down in Kentucky with you guys?  No, it was in Kansas City.  A big bar fight when we were on stage.  I was on stage.  It's just a big bra.  Bonnie said that you completely just took it in stride.  There's a full legs flailing, heads being chopped, and you were just talking.  You were like, I'm going to sell DVDs.  That's all I cared about.  Oh, my God.  It's like, how am I going to sell my DVDs after this show if these people come?  See, the difference in a bar fight with white people and black people, if you're in a black  bar and this bar fight breaks out, black people fly out the door because guns are going to be shot. 
[01:34:00]  Well, it's funny because there was a black table that came in just prior to this fight going down.  And when the dust cleared, they were the only ones that were gone.  That was the only table that actually left.  And when there's a barroom brawl with white people, they just either watch or get involved.  They sit back and watch.  Can you say it again?  Well, you cut me off.  Barroom brawl?  I said a barroom brawl.  All right?  Like, there's going to be between us right now, you and I.  So, it's such a different, you know, a show than doing here, here, or there.  Here, you're like, boom, boom, boom. 
[01:34:30]  Here, you know, theaters are great, man, especially in an audience like this.  They really are.  Comedians love it.  I think that you have to, like, there's so much atmosphere to, like, there's a club's a club's a club,  but a theater can go so well.  But a theater's a theater.  Well, here's another thing, too.  When you're working in a theater like this, people are coming because they know you.  They're coming to the show because they, you know, they want to see Norn or they want to see Bobby or Patrice or everybody, whatever.  They're coming because they know you.  Hey, come in here and talk to them. 
[01:35:00]  So, they know you.  A comedy club gets the people that know you and the people that go there every week.  And free tickets and all that crap.  And the thing about an O&A audience, you cannot say anything to offend them.  There's nothing you could do.  You could go down and rip somebody's eye right out of their sock and go, it's a bit.  It's a bit.  You know what?  Who was the first O&A fan?  Was Anthony the fan of Opie first and Opie the fan?  And that's how it started.  Like, there had to be the first one because now there's, like, what, 200?  Now we're going back to the book of Genesis. 
[01:35:30]  We're going pre-Lord.  Pre-Jesus Christ and the Lord.  All right.  You know what?  We're going to take a break.  We're going to regroup.  We're going to take a break.  We want to thank Lynn for stopping in.  Thank you, Lynn.  Thanks for tonight, Red.  We'll be right.  No, she didn't save us.  This one went well.  Whackbaggers.  Whackbaggers just went well.  Boy.  All right.  We'll be right back.  Have a great show.  We'll be right back.  Thanks.  Bye.  Nice.  Vegas music.  All right. 
[01:36:00]  You're in the middle of the...  I don't even know what to call this, but this is Thane and Sam, but we're still in the  midst of the Opie and Anthony traveling virus backstage show.  Spectacular.  It's actually what it's called.  Pure genius.  Yes.  With Voss and Bonnie, and apparently Bob Kelly is going to be there to give you a little  more radio gold.  Oh, yeah.  Bob Kelly.  Do I smell sarcasm in Nathaniel?  No.  You and your doll eyes?  He's right around there.  It's exciting back here, don't you think?  Robert Kelly?  I'm on the...  I'm actually on a chick radio show right now. 
[01:36:30]  That's what I feel like.  The lights are so bright.  Hey, guys.  Thanks for having me on.  I'm at the Cleveland Improv all week.  You know what's the sad thing?  It's just that right now it's going to go on Bobby's resume.  The Rich and Bonnie show on radio.  All right, Rich.  Really?  Is that bomb going to go on my resume, too?  Is what?  Is that bomb going to go on my resume?  It's just that you have seven jokes that you fill in the blank a lot of times.  Oh, because I didn't know what was going on?  I've heard that one a lot of times.  Oh, look who's talking.  I have kids? 
[01:37:00]  You have kids?  Okay, but that always gets a laugh.  All right.  Anyway, let's switch gears here for a second.  You know, I just realized if she gets fucking famous, if we do something together and she  gets big...  What do you mean, if?  And throw me under the bus.  What do you mean, if?  I love the term, throw me under the bus.  I've just heard so many people use it lately.  First of all, it's going to happen, Voss.  What?  It's definitely going to happen.  She's young, pretty, and she has hope.  I have hope.  Thank you.  If I can just get rid of this Jew baby, I'm on my way. 
[01:37:30]  No, keep that.  That's going to get you in the biz.  That's going to help.  Take that Jew baby and sell it to a Jew couple that can't have kids.  That's going to keep you in the biz?  Is that hip-hop?  Is that just...  Oh, I got that.  Wow, you really suck.  All you have to do is let you finish.  You know what Patrice said to me today?  He goes, you're starting to have the same shape as an ONA fan.  To you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  When I looked at you, it reminded me.  Thank you.  Bonnie goes, um, anyways, take a sip of water.  I know. 
[01:38:00]  What did you do after the pool?  Where did you go?  I went to a gym.  A guy's room named Jim?  You are so...  I swear to God.  I'm like Shikki Kappa.  It came into my head and I go, don't even say it.  We are in Vegas.  It just seems sort of a...  You know, when my dog, when I walk my dog, every time he pees on the fire hydrant, I call  him a hack.  Nothing.  So, you know, it's fucked up.  To be fair, Joe Rogan walked in right when you were saying your joke.  Joe Rogan did walk in.  Joe Rogan, everybody.  You know what's funny?  When you said none of us, no matter what we say, none of us are going to say anything  positive to the other person. 
[01:38:30]  Why?  Why can't we be friendly to each other?  I think, look, Kelly's really pretty.  I'm very...  Lynch Rockrock thinks you're pretty.  I'm very...  Thank you.  You're one of my favorite people.  I love Bonnie.  Yeah, me and Bonnie are always nice to each other.  I met her.  We're fine.  It was just you.  It's me?  Yeah.  Did that sound just like Jew?  It's Jew.  It's me?  What?  You're very...  You're very...  You're nice negative.  I am, Connor.  That's how he...  That's how he shows his love.  This is Voss' MO.  He slams you.  If it doesn't work, he's really nice to you.  Until he can think of a good one again. 
[01:39:00]  It's like a baby does that.  Huh?  We were at the cellar the other night, and Bob...  I was on stage, and Bobby and Keith came at me.  I wish we could all walk out of the room right now.  Why?  Patrice is here.  Have a seat, Patrice.  You just started a story.  What's that?  This green room is really getting fired up right now.  Joe's doing some karate exercises.  It's crazy.  This is just...  You know what?  Really?  I might bail...  It was that bad?  I didn't even...  Everything's gone crazy. 
[01:39:30]  You know, it hurts me more because I never bomb.  So it's weird.  It's like a weird feeling.  This is what hurts me is that we're wearing headsets, and we're three feet away from each  other.  Like we're in a studio.  We're in a shitty green room.  They made us.  They told us we had to.  I'm ready to bail out of our show right now.  Your show?  Don't say our.  I'm not included in this.  Yes, you are.  In the contract.  No.  Yes, it was.  I'm not in a contract.  Oh, whatever.  Is it the Rich and Bonnie show or the Bonnie and Rich show?  It's the Bonnie show.  It's the...  I'm not at Bonnie.  Do not mean it.  It's going to be called the Bonnie gets rich show off of Rich.  Nothing?  Wow.  Jesus. 
[01:40:00]  Anyway.  It is...  Ilya Rogan is actually squinting his eyes on that one.  I think Rogan just...  We've got the world famous Red Band in the room.  He's not doing the show anymore.  What's going on, Patrice?  How you doing, Patrice?  He looks good.  He looks good.  He looks good.  You know what?  Just say, hey, I'm from Fox News.  How you doing?  Then I'll answer you.  Patrice, remember that fill-in-the-blank thing?  What's that?  I didn't even know you...  Bonnie, when did you get here?  Oh, come on. 
[01:40:30]  I've been holding this thing together the whole time.  Can Patrice carry a tune?  Patrice, can you sing?  Like all black people?  Yeah.  Jesus.  What?  Is this on the radio?  Is this...  I don't know.  It's radio.  It's amazing.  It's amazing, like, the medium, where it's no crowd, but you know just nothing funny  is happening.  Like, there's not even a subtle thing that someone's picking up on. 
[01:41:00]  You know what's bad?  When the XM audience is going, give us back Nathaniel and Sam.  That's what...  When they want those guys back, that's what you're going...  They went for E-Rock and his music choices before this.  These are people just running the clamor to get out of this situation.  What's going on?  It was going good.  The first part of this went good.  What happened?  Robert Kelly ruined the vibe, I think.  You know what it is?  I think it...  You know what it is?  Robert.  Bobby...  Bobby really has grown to be bigger than the room kind of guy.  He's just...  He's too big to do certain things now. 
[01:41:30]  But, no, that's in his head.  He's not...  Bobby's bigger than the room now.  No, here's the thing about Bobby.  We were having a good thing.  It was fun.  We're talking.  Just shut up and wait and listen.  You come in and you just...  With your negativity, all right?  That's true.  Gold feature.  That's true.  You are negative now, Bobby.  You've had a good run for four or five months now, all right?  He's negative.  I know.  But all of a sudden, he thinks he's Mr. Down in History.  And he could come in.  You know what I mean?  It's amazing. 
[01:42:00]  Bobby comes in.  I come in.  I like this.  I came in.  Joe Rogan is a celebrity.  I came in.  You can feel Joe's vibe.  Joe's just bigger than the room.  Yeah.  Joe didn't complain about the fact we had to walk up a spiral staircase.  Like this was the 16th century.  What do you mean?  Spiral spring breaks came out of the 17th and 50th.  Fucking shitty leopard skin carpet.  What is it?  A 10 by 7?  10 by 9 maybe?  We walked up a three-fledged spiral staircase.  Yes.  I thought I was a fireman. 
[01:42:30]  This is actually starting to be a better show now is what you trash the person who doesn't  have a microphone.  I'm kind of like that.  I'm still upset about Kurt Vonnegut dying.  It's a better thing.  But he did.  So go on about Bobby's negativity.  Go on about Bobby's.  People are not like you.  That's what you want.  All as long as long as people are not like you.  Joseph, can I give you something?  I don't like you.  I don't care.  You know what hurts me?  It really hurts me about Rich is that he desperately wants to go on a rant. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, no.  And he just can't.  Like he, his rants are maybe a paragraph and an incomplete sentence.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Rich wants to take a subject matter and just go off on it.  You know why that's so mean?  This is why that's so mean.  Because every one of us has been in one position at one point in time when you're doing like  fucking morning radio somewhere.  And you want to go on. 
[01:43:30]  You want to like say something funny.  And you ain't got shit.  Nothing.  And someone, they're talking about the news.  Yeah, I guess, uh, guess that's what happened.  Nothing.  And you're like, damn, I wish I could dig deep right now and just hit you with some original shit.  But also, in fairness, they've been asking you, in fairness, to Voss.  What?  They run to Voss when they need somebody to do shit.  When they need somebody to do some crowd something or somebody to do the radio thing. 
[01:44:00]  Voss always comes through.  I will say that to everybody listening.  Voss.  Because if they ask, hey, Patrice, can you do an hour radio show at the pool and bomb all night and not walk away?  Can you come in a room and pray to God someone else comes in here and just starts talking?  Can I tell you what the quality is?  That Rich has a very high tolerance to shame.  So that's why he's able to do all that.  You know, Bonnie, that's the thing. 
[01:44:30]  It's something about Rich.  It's some weird.  He's just, he has, and you know it.  You love him and you're married to him.  He wants attention.  He doesn't care what it is.  He has an ability to do something.  And it's like, it may be even so magical that you can't understand it.  Like today at the pool, you bombed six times before I got there, when I was there.  And then you bombed during the press conference and you were fearless at bombing. 
[01:45:00]  Rich is, he doesn't give a fuck.  My self-esteem is too low.  After a while, I just went into a shell and said, please let this end.  Here's the thing.  I did have a couple of good lines, but here's the thing.  I had some good lines in the pool.  Here's the thing.  We're all going back and forth.  It's got to be a great line to make any one of us say that was a good line.  But it's so hard to do what you do then.  I think it's harder to, like, fight the fire that's keeping you not funny rather than running 
[01:45:30]  away when you're just not.  What are you talking about?  Take her back.  But you don't like the fire that's keeping you not funny.  What the fuck was she talking about?  All of a sudden, this is a movie about marathon runners.  Wait, did you see that soliloquy she just said?  Voss does something that bad every 30 seconds and he continues to march on.  You see this young lady after that awful rant she just tried?  She's finished.  She's wrapping up her mic.  She's gone. 
[01:46:00]  Rich will walk half the audience and then still sell his DVD.  That's the beauty of Rich Voss.  He's amazingly adept at badness.  It's just amazing, Rich.  Are you out of your mind?  When we did a show here at the Reebok show, who held you together?  Voss, you hold it together every time.  That's the thing.  You come out in the shoes.  You'll just go out and do it and you'll go.  It's like you take bad, make it worse, and somehow it works. 
[01:46:30]  And it makes it better.  Voss brings it down to where it can't be but better.  Anything else is just wow.  It's amazing, dude.  It's fucking, you can't, really, it's like people say Ross is awful, but it's almost the biggest  love.  You know the way I look at it?  I look at it like a juggler.  If you watch a juggling act, the juggler's never perfect.  They always drop balls on purpose.  They always make sure they drop balls.  No, no, no.  I'm going to try it again.  Because if the juggler can just do it perfectly, you get bored after five minutes.  But if he wants to train together a half hour, he's got to pretend to drop balls. 
[01:47:00]  You don't want to make him a piece.  I just drop them.  Voss doesn't drop them on purpose.  I know.  But the fact that he dropped some bricks and then in between those bricks, he says some  funny fucking shit.  That's why it really works.  It really works because the bricks come in between some hilarious, really funny shit.  He lowers their...  The bricks are bad, bro.  They're heavy.  They fucking hurt your feet if you drop them on them. 
[01:47:30]  They're real, dude.  They're bricks.  This is good praise, Voss.  They're real bricks, bro.  This is good praise?  The bricks, you got some gold.  It's like, he won't go away.  It won't stop.  I've never...  I was talking to Bobby today.  I swear to you, I'm saying, how does Voss do...  Was it this morning at Starbucks?  I was like, Voss says so many things that somebody looks at.  Like, so many times, Voss will be in a room and say something.  I think just because we automatically want him to do it to make everybody go, what the 
[01:48:00]  fuck are you talking about, Rich?  Frank Caliendo walks into the room.  It won't stop.  It's a party going on up in this bitch.  Frank, what kind of...  What are you doing?  Are you ready for this show?  I feel it.  I feel you, Frank.  Yeah, I'm hosting the first show.  He's hosting every show.  So this is not...  What is this?  This goes till 8 and it's over?  I don't know what...  No, they're going to keep...  I guess you...  Body or whatever...  Yeah, yeah.  And do you feel good now after this trashing to get out there and really...  Get those bricks in the air. 
[01:48:30]  No, I know.  He's the only one to go out there and at the beginning of the show and host it.  I don't want this on mic.  He can hold the mic back.  Is it going to be positive?  It's positive.  I'm complimenting.  I don't want people to hear it.  Listen, any words of wisdom from Frank?  Any words of wisdom from Frank as somebody else?  Frank, do William Shakespeare, nigga, and give us some words of wisdom. 
[01:49:00]  You can say do William Shakespeare.  Nobody knows who...  Jesus.  It may be.  He may just say William Shatner.  That's what's great about Frank.  He does nobody else's impressions.  I can do William Shakespeare.  To be...  Who the fuck knows what he was like?  He sounds like he takes 18th century...  To eat or not to eat.  Hey, Frank, here's a question for you.  What's your most...  What's your most...  The impression you're most proud of?  That you're amazed with yourself that you do it.  I'm amazed by myself. 
[01:49:30]  I mean, you do it.  People are amazed.  You go, you know what?  I'm proud of that.  I'm proud of that.  The impression that that shirt fits them.  No, no, no.  No, no.  Frank is...  Frank is famous fat.  Like, he's...  He really is.  I'm like...  I think what that means, too.  I'm a civilian fat.  I'm just fat.  I'm like a civilian fat.  Like a regular person fat.  He's famous.  You know what?  I know what he means.  He's not...  Like Horatio Sands.  He's...  He's not fat, but he's just...  He's just a big man.  But I've lost a bunch of weight.  Oh, maybe that's it.  A little bit of weight. 
[01:50:00]  Keep going.  Frank, don't be...  Don't be...  Don't be...  Don't have...  Low carb.  Low carb.  Low carb.  Ultimate fighting.  My friend, Brian, he lost 60 pounds.  He's like...  How many pounds?  60 what?  60 tears.  62 pounds.  It'll last like four months.  Doing what?  How?  Weight Watchers.  Whoa.  Frank, I joined Weight Watchers.  Frank, what's your...  What's your...  Yo, to you.  Come on, man.  To you.  What's my favorite impression?  For yourself.  Fuck what everybody else.  Just for you.  Maybe you don't even do it anymore.  It makes me real proud. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Be honest.  Actually, the Bush thing is...  Why don't we definitely...  All right, what was one...  Just kidding.  Hey, what was one...  Hey, suck it.  Hey, Frank, what was one that you did in your lifetime that just never caught on and you  go, how come...  How can this not catch on?  How can Muppockers not love this?  Maybe it was William Shakespeare.  Joe.  Joe.  Joe.  That's pretty good about it.  Joe, what'd you do before you came down here?  Hi, Pernice.  You just read a good question.  Huh?  I'm thinking that Patrice O'Neill is a little weak.  If you do an impression here, will you turn around and get ready first and then turn... 
[01:51:00]  Will you wait, boss?  I was really...  That's an interesting question.  I do.  I pull the hair back for every impression.  I pull the hair back for the George Bush turnaround.  Hey, man.  Hey, I'm doing the visuals for those of you who are obviously missing on the radio.  There's a guy who's a jackass.  There was none.  I never got like the reaction you needed to get to continue to do it.  You know, not real.  I don't...  Everything seems...  I hate to say it, but everything seems to work.  No, I don't know.  I really don't know because it's like... 
[01:51:30]  Will you stop trying to be shy like the black girl from American Idol?  Shrek?  Yeah, Shrek.  Oh, don't call him.  I want to ask him a question in my voice.  Does it piss you off since you're a professional...  I mean, you are a professional impersonator.  You can do any voice, right?  I mean, you do some pretty...  But the ones you can do, you do pretty badass.  Dead on the money.  What I do is I don't show people all the bad ones.  That's what I hate about impressions is people will say,  I do 600 impressions and then 50 of them that they start off with,  you're like, that doesn't sound anything like the guy.  Right.  And then they don't have a joke for it. 
[01:52:00]  Like Rich Little?  Rich Little, every guy that advertises at the airport,  the guy who's around here, who...  You know what I'm talking about?  We were just watching Brian.  Do you remember his name?  Who's on every cab?  Danny Gans?  No, the other guy.  Not Danny Gans?  No.  It was terrible, though.  It was terrible.  He was doing his impressions on the other thing,  and you're like, this guy's an opener, man.  This is horrible.  This is horrible shit.  Oh, put the mic to your mouth, Joe.  No.  He's so supportive.  No, he just can't...  Here's my question, though.  Does it piss you off when you watch movies like...  Well, you know, like movies like 300, 
[01:52:30]  where they're supposed to be talking Greek,  and they have English accents?  Everyone has a fucking English accent.  He's not a, like...  The league guy.  He always has a major.  Like...  I don't really care.  Why was that...  Because being a person who's, like,  awesome at voices...  He's not a linguistic professor  or anything like that, are you?  Aren't the two related somehow?  I guess they are.  Yeah, that really pisses me off, Joe.  Thank you.  I feel vindication.  Yeah, I had no idea.  It angered me so much until now.  I thought about it.  I'm like, what the hell was I thinking?  Why wasn't I on top of this? 
[01:53:00]  This is what I do.  That's what I'm saying.  It's a business.  Can I be honest?  Without kissing Frank's ass,  top three impressions I've ever seen.  I can't put them in order,  because Frank's here,  but it's Jim Carrey,  fucking Richard Cabler.  Remember Richard Cabler?  Yeah, Cabler.  And Frank Caliendo,  and then Aerie Spears is right up there.  Oh, Aerie Spears is good.  He's right up there.  His rap thing that he did,  Woody J.  LL Cool J.  Jay-Z is unbelievable.  That is freaky.  The only thing that makes Frank so legendary 
[01:53:30]  is John Madden.  John Madden makes Frank legendary in this game.  Yeah, but the Bush is dead on the money, too.  The Bush is better than anybody's Bush.  What about Rich Little?  You don't know.  Except, uh...  I never thought...  He did a great Johnny Carson,  and it's easy to translate  when he's 9,000 years old,  but Rich Little did a great Johnny Carson.  Other than that,  he was not amazing to me.  Frank, can you do a mediocre Johnny Carson for him?  I guess.  Oh, yes.  Why not?  Oh, my God.  That was Ed McMahon. 
[01:54:00]  I think part of it is  that if you have one impression  that you do  that nobody else really does,  there's somebody else  doing a John Madden somewhere.  They're just not on TV doing it.  I think Jay Moore does good impressions, too.  He does a wicked Christopher Walker.  No, Christopher Walker,  and the other one,  Penn's brother,  is unbelievable.  Yeah, that...  And Harvey Keitel.  Chris Penn is just on his right on.  See, he does a Chris Penn.  Dude, he does...  Jay's good because he does people nobody does.  That's what...  That is the greatest...  That's what I'm saying?  He does Harvey Keitel. 
[01:54:30]  Nobody does John Madden.  Like, you can't even think...  You know, there's some dudes who go,  I didn't even...  All I can do is listen to John Madden  and not think  to try to do that motherfucker.  Chris Penn is good, dude.  Give me some John Madden real quick.  I mean, you think about a guy  who does that kind of a thing,  and then you hear him do it,  you hear him say it,  I mean, I mean, I mean,  why was that guy doing that?  Oh, Christ, man.  That shit is like...  You know, there's the weird ones.  The weird ones.  And now I've heard more people do it.  Oh, no, Roger Keitel.  What do you think about Roger Keitel?  I think he's...  I think Keitel was one of the first guys  I ever saw that was amazing, 
[01:55:00]  but not truly hilarious.  Very good at what he did,  but you watched him go,  and this guy's crazy over the top,  but you didn't really have the jokes.  You know what I mean?  Right, right.  So that was a little bit different.  But the impressions,  just...  Yeah, I mean,  you know,  the people that want...  It's the weird ones.  It's the weird ones that get people.  Do you do any women?  No.  That's a good...  Yeah, you know what?  I can't.  You ever try to do any?  I can't.  I'm not very good at it,  and two, it just always seems weird.  Who has seen how did...  Are there any animals in your repertoire?  A guy that can do women.  But a guy that can do impressions of women. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, um...  I don't know.  I've never seen a guy.  It just always seems kind of weird.  Wait, you know who does good women impressions?  Uh, Sweetie Puss.  Mario Cantone.  Mario Cantone could do any woman  from 1940 and under the...  Betty Davis,  fucking...  Esther Elridge,  whatever.  Hey, what do you mean?  You know, baby.  I'm just saying,  I'm watching, man. 
[01:56:00]  Relax.  I'm sorry.  I know you're...  It's interesting to me, man.  These strippers are dancing with enthusiasm, man.  It's a great art  when somebody's really good at it, man.  It's amazing.  It's been a long time  since I've seen  less inspired strip dancing.  Yeah, they're horrified.  They're looking out  at our audience going,  I can't strip.  Yeah, these girls  are putting on the worst game face ever.  Are they aging?  Oh, there's some titties, though.  They're looking at it, but they seem...  Oh, they're used to, yeah,  stripping in front of guys  that are put together well.  $6,000 tips.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:56:30]  Got the American Express,  the black...  Oh, my.  The black Amex.  Dirty little pig.  She could use a little conditioner.  Yeah, right?  When you mix this Vegas crowd  with the ODA crowd,  are you in fear  that there is going to be  some type of...  Oh, yeah.  Some type of assault  at some point?  I've been waiting  for the rumble to start.  How funny was it  out by the pool  that you could so tell  our audience  and everyone else  that is just hanging out  in Vegas?  The abs against the stomach.  You see those hot girls  walk by  and there's some of the guys  from the ONA fans  just licking their chops 
[01:57:00]  quietly like,  fuck this press conference.  You could hear it smacking.  But you know the problem?  We were hanging out with Joe.  It was nothing but  ultimate fighters out there.  Nothing but dangerous guys.  Like, Joe's like,  oh, yeah, that's such and such.  Oh, there's no such and such.  He killed 17 people.  Oh, wait.  You're not kidding?  There were really fighters?  Yeah, there were a bunch  of fighters out there.  A lot of guys who fight  in the UFC train in Vegas.  Wow, no kidding.  And so they're here all the time.  And some of them  look like you could  fuck with them.  There was one guy  who came up.  Kendall Grove.  He looks like a guy 
[01:57:30]  you, you,  like, he looks like  an in-shape,  out-of-shape guy  that you can go,  fuck you, dude.  He got all these  weird tattoos.  And what gave it away,  his ears were fucked up.  If you see somebody  with fucked up ears,  they can fight.  And he had strange tattoos.  I think he had,  like, a picture  of the Statue of Liberty  with an eagle.  Foster gloves on.  Yeah, with something weird,  he goes,  man, this motherfucker  can fucking fight  for some reason.  It was the king  in Hawaii.  King Kamehameha,  I think that's who it is.  Who? 
[01:58:00]  The king in Hawaii,  that legendary king,  I think it was King Kamehameha.  I think that's who it is  on his back.  Oh, that's who it is on his back?  Yeah, he's Hawaiian.  Like, how would you know  to get that tattoo  unless you beat up people  for a living?  If I got a tattoo  of Frederick Douglass  on my back,  you know I'm writing books.  Yeah, that tattoo's  a little different  than Ying Yang.  A giant King Kamehameha.  That's hardcore, man.  That motherfucker  is calling the spirits  a volcano.  Fuck, man.  He had to get permission  from the god itself  to get that tattoo.  He'll fuck you up, man. 
[01:58:30]  Hey, get back  to the strippers  on the TV.  They are, like,  not inspired  to be out there.  Here's what's really funny  when they go to each other  for support.  Like, they turn to the left one  and make some stupid joke  and laugh at it.  It's like the most  hilarious thing ever.  It's like they find  comfort in each other.  They use each other  like little flotation devices  out there in the fucking  ocean of Opie and Anthony.  It's funny you say flotation devices  because she's doing  the swim or something.  Well, look at those  flotation devices  stuffed underneath her skin.  Wow!  Hey!  Hey, now!  And they're not as hot. 
[01:59:00]  You know,  Vegas strippers  you thought would be  100%.  Like, I'm not into  these sexy strippers  anyway, like these 10s.  Right.  But you would think,  okay, if you go to  Vegas, they're all 10s.  But a few of those girls  today had,  seriously,  had stretch marks.  A few of them  looked aged.  Well, there's a lot of guys  who don't like girls  that are perfect.  They're very intimidated by them.  You want to look like  you can fast them around a bit  and it's not going to  affect their whole life.  Well, you want to look like  your baby could fuck them.  Maybe.  You want to just... 
[01:59:30]  Everything went perfectly  according to plan.  You took her out  the right amount of dates  and you said the right amount  of funny jokes  and you were the nicest guy  eventually.  Bonnie looks very fetishy now.  Yeah.  With that belly.  Pregnant stripper.  Have you ever seen...  I've seen one.  You've seen a pregnant stripper?  We were somewhere.  Brian and I were somewhere.  I've seen...  Oh, we were in Austin, Texas  and the girl was  four months pregnant  and she was having  all the other girls  feel her stomach  and she was proud.  She was on the dance floor.  You were going,  what the fuck?  This is just a caricature. 
[02:00:00]  This is just...  This is one of those  things that you see  in a movie  that, oh, come on.  I guess she's going to make money.  Uh-oh.  You're probably going to  drug habit.  You're going on stage.  I was at a strip club  and another girl  had a bushel  of grape hemorrhoids  coming out of her.  Oh!  And she spun around  and as she spun...  That's not true.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  Right on La Cienega,  the strip club,  me, Jay Moore,  Matt Frost,  as she spun around...  The star strip?  Yes.  The guy's face  just turned  as she turned  and it was like  a big red bushel 
[02:00:30]  of grape  sticking out of her house.  That place is in my act.  There's a joke  that actually happened  where a girl...  I was asking her a question.  It's in one of my first CDs  where I said,  is it fun?  Do you like dancing there?  And she goes,  I don't talk to guys  who come here.  She gave me a shit  about talking to guys.  She wouldn't talk to anybody.  All she wanted to do  was just do her shit  and that's all I do.  You remember...  It's a funny joke  to you throw.  What is it you say?  I heard of there's a place...  Well, she goes,  most of the guys  who come here are creeps.  Why did you come here?  Because somebody told me  there was a place  that I could go  where I could see  a strange girl's pussy 
[02:01:00]  for a dollar.  No, but you said  how many nickels?  Bushel.  Well, yeah,  like Tiffany's  looking out for Jacksonville.  That's the only nickels.  Not just favorite change.  Do you remember?  What's the fucking show?  I forgot the show.  The cartoon thing  I used to do.  The damn shorties.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know,  that joke was the pilot  for that show.  Did you know that?  No.  That joke was the actual pilot  for that show.  Really?  It would have been nice  if somebody just told me.  Shit, nigga,  I'm sorry about that.  That's funny. 
[02:01:30]  I thought you should know that,  but I didn't know that.  You should tell me.  I don't know.  Because they didn't want to pay you.  I never made it.  That really happened, though.  That Starship's a fucking shithole.  Oh, that Starship's bad, dude.  Really bad.  That's one of those  right out of a movie strip clubs  where the guys are smoking cigarettes  as he takes your ticket  and he just...  Oh, Jesus.  You walk through  and you're like, whoa.  And the velvet just...  Why am I looking...  Everything's just wretched.  There's no hope in that place.  That place just reeks of despair.  Are there strip clubs  just shattered dreams? 
[02:02:00]  Hey, Joe.  Well, at least they're a rhino.  They have cars.  Why am I looking at a hemorrhoid?  Who is that?  Oh, that's our friend  Ari Shaffir's butthole.  Oh, my God.  Wait, does he have a hemorrhoid on it?  Is it bad?  Look, it looks like  puffing badge.  Let's check that out.  Oh, my God.  That's really what it looks like.  I can't even look at it.  Oh, my God.  I can't look at it.  Go ahead, Bob.  Ari doesn't seem to be looking at it.  Come on, Bob.  Ari seems to be looking at  if there's anything wrong with it.  Here goes Bob.  Here goes Bob.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[02:02:30]  Get a mic up.  Is that really from seeing Ari's butthole?  It honestly looks like pussy lips.  Whoa.  It's so disgusting.  Joe.  Dude, it made...  Ari, your asshole,  made Bobby Kelly throw up.  Well, now we know  Bobby Kelly doesn't get naked  in front of the mirror.  Bobby, see it again.  Look at that.  Bobby, just take a look.  He can't answer it.  Take a look at that.  We got it real quick.  Oh, my God.  Okay, but Bob...  That's amazing.  Didn't Norton get in your hotel room last night? 
[02:03:00]  Like, what happened then?  You know what?  We got the joke the first time, Bobby.  It's only...  You really feel it for Boston.  You know what?  It's only...  It's only dirty, like, fucked up things of women.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's not like it's not normal.  Listen, Bobby.  Bobby has 75 pictures  of actual human shits  on his phone,  but that bothers him.  Women, like,  things with women  on their asses  and pussies  bother Bobby like that.  That's a guy's asshole.  It's a guy's asshole?  Yes. 
[02:03:30]  It's a guy's asshole  you just make me look at.  I think that's what bothers you.  It looked like pussy.  Now we know.  That was good.  You want to let us keep Bobby.  Jesus, you really do  fill in for Boston.  Bobby.  Bobby, you faggot.  Get back here.  I don't psychoanalyze you, dude.  I think she might have hit a chord.  I just don't understand...  I hate to say it, dude,  but she's got a point.  I don't understand  the weak stomach.  It doesn't take a lot  for him to puke.  That's so crazy.  Oh, really?  When is a hemorrhoid...  Bobby, when is a hemorrhoid  coming out of a guy's asshole?  Not a lot.  It's not... 
[02:04:00]  I'm not puking...  I'm not puking  at a kid eating Cheerios,  you ass.  But you're the only one puking.  Ari bent over  and showed us his asshole  and we were like,  what the fuck is wrong  with your butt?  It's swollen.  That's how that...  I honestly want to call him  and ask him how he shit.  It looks like a sheep's asshole.  He says it.  He says he's only...  He's pushing it out.  That's why it looks like that.  How do you push out your asshole?  That's what I said.  All right, Bobby.  We lost Bobby.  That's hilarious.  Bobby and pussy.  Bobby Kelly hosting Fear Factor?  Different angle. 
[02:04:30]  You'd have thrown up  every five seconds.  Joe, Joe.  Bobby, we got another angle.  Have you ever lost it  on any level of Fear Factor?  I lost it once  watching it at home.  I didn't lose it on the set.  On the set,  I came close like that  and I would have to walk away  and swallow.  I came real close.  What was the closest thing  that made you just lose it?  There were blended flies  and maggots.  Stop being a fucking...  And drank a cup of that.  Drinking it through a straw  and they were gagging  and the flies were like live.  And they were like...  They were eating these... 
[02:05:00]  I mean,  they were actual flies.  They're eating them.  They're chewing the flies up  and you see the fucking  fly eyeballs  and they're gagging.  Is it done?  Is Fear Factor done?  Yeah.  Now,  did it jump the shark  for you at some point?  Yeah,  like episode three probably.  Right when I was like,  no,  really?  We're still doing this?  What the fuck is going on?  I really did think  it was going to be cancer.  Really?  A turtle spit sandwich?  That sounds good.  Let's just do that.  We were trying to get them  to drink human urine  and I was like,  you gotta be fucking kidding me.  We were trying to get them  to drink piss.  That's an easy one though.  It's not easy to regular... 
[02:05:30]  Prepare to people.  To you guys.  Well,  you've seen the baby bird.  Well,  once you've seen the baby bird,  it's like...  We're playing the baby bird tonight  for these freaks.  There's never been anything  like that before.  That's one of the greatest  videos ever.  That was the craziest shit  I've ever seen in my life.  We just got the old video  we're going to play tonight  in between comedians.  The guy who won  the eggnog drinking contest,  how many shots?  70-something.  70-something shots.  Pat from Munaki,  he's like 300 pounds.  He's a diabetic,  so he's got to throw it...  He would have thrown it up anyway  because he had so much eggnog.  So he gets to the last one  and we get one of the interns 
[02:06:00]  to lean his fucking head  over a garbage pail  and open up his mouth  and he throws up  in the kid's mouth  all over space.  Joe Rogan's idea.  It was insanity.  It was Joey's idea.  It was insanity.  It was insanity.  I couldn't believe  anybody would listen.  Your imagination is...  Well, you know,  I feel like when you open  yourself up to the universe,  it just brings you  thoughts and ideas.  Isn't it amazing, though,  Bobby Kelly's gag reflexes  are that strong  that he's that fat? 
[02:06:30]  Bobby!  Bobby!  He's throwing up  for real, man.  That was hilarious.  He just could...  Immediately,  his eyes water.  They close.  That's not faking it.  His eyes are closing up.  He's tearing.  And he starts gagging.  It's a weird thing.  I didn't expect that from him.  Seeing as he was showing  everybody shit on his arm.  Maybe you should only  serve him hamburgers  that have hemorrhoids.  Just make a hemorrhoid ride with it.  People get weird with shit.  I had a girl  that I used to date  where if she saw a needle  on TV,  she would pass out.  I'm like that  when she was a kid 
[02:07:00]  or something.  I don't know.  I'm like that  with anything  that has to do  with women's...  Tampons  and panty shields  make me sick.  Panty shields  make me really...  Afterbirth.  That's your placenta?  Are you going to cook it up?  We're giving away  as part of a podcast.  Panty shields do it, man.  No, no, no.  Body, can we have it?  We can do something with that.  Yeah, whoever names the baby  gets the placenta. 
[02:07:30]  Bring it to the show.  We'll do something with that.  Somebody will eat the placenta?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We're going to do something  with her placenta.  That was another thing  they said no on.  Why don't you say that for, would you?  On Fear Factor,  we try to get people  to eat placenta.  I'm going to be like  having the baby to the doctor.  Can you please save that?  I'm going to need that  for later.  Well, and you didn't say,  hey, have a good birth.  Things go well.  Hey, man.  Listen, that placenta?  Just make sure  you don't break the placenta.  Believe me.  We'll throw it in the freezer  at work.  I guarantee  Vals will be in with a mic  at his birth. 
[02:08:00]  Are we starting the show  or what?  Doesn't it start at eight?  Yeah, it's supposed to.  More strippers, though.  Look at this one.  They're enthusiastic.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, like, aren't people cheering?  I think they got mad  because they got booed earlier.  Are you on the stage right now?  Hey, girls.  Hi.  Hi.  Hey.  Oh, my God.  You know, Pete got mad at Kenny 
[02:08:30]  because he called the girl skanks  today during the press conference.  Who did?  Why?  Who got mad at him?  Remember the press conference?  Kenny goes,  let's hear it for the skanks  or whatever.  Who got mad, though?  Pete, who's putting this  whole thing together for us.  Oh, papalato?  Well, because, you know,  they're helping out the show.  Let's be honest, Obie.  Let's be quite honest.  They're supposed to be  exotic dancers.  You can pay those bitches off  to like the word skank.  Extra 50, they'll be skanks.  Let's stop it.  Yeah, skank does imply a curtain.  Well, you know what?  But you can't call them strippers anymore. 
[02:09:00]  They're exotic dancers.  Why can't they get mad?  You can put your cock in their ear.  I think you can call them strippers.  You can put your cock in their ear.  What clubs are you going to?  Well, I do it.  I don't know if I do it.  Crazy broad.  Today in the bathroom  after that chick came up  and said,  Hey, can I turn the music down  or whatever?  All these girls were in the bathroom  and they were all talking about it  and they were saying like,  I mean, I've been embarrassed myself before,  but not in front of 8 million people. 
[02:09:30]  Yes, she has.  It's just those 8 million  didn't tell her she was an idiot.  Yeah.  They were just going,  Oh, really?  They were quite down on her.  All right.  What do you want to do?  You want to take a break?  I think we should go down  and interview Vos  before he goes on.  Look at Bonnie walking out pregnant.  Looking like Bobby Kelly.  Is there food around?  It's so strange.  It's so strange to know someone  and then to see them like pregnant.  It's like,  Whoa, you're making a person. 
[02:10:00]  You got a little baby factory  going on inside your body right now.  Bonnie's pregnant like every other woman.  You're a hack.  I know.  I can't.  You figure a coffee house girl,  you know,  you'd be pregnant different.  Well, I'm not keeping it.  You know what's really hack?  What's really hack now  would be going to other countries  to get babies.  Everyone's doing that shit.  Madonna's doing it.  Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are doing it.  Everybody's trying to go  to other countries to get babies.  That's hack now.  Right.  Yeah.  Why don't you just fuck somebody 
[02:10:30]  from another country, right?  That'll be the next step.  Well, that makes more problems.  That'll be the next one.  You know,  there's a lot of babies out there  that...  Why not?  These mommies and daddies.  Laughing at you.  Chiming in.  You can give a fuck.  Try to be a team player.  Man, that'll be the next thing.  Hey, man.  I like this.  Shit's crazy, man.  I actually like this.  This is like...  This isn't heavy lifting.  I did my show all week. 
[02:11:00]  This is just hanging, man.  I could handle this  on a regular basis.  Yeah, you're under  a lot more stress  than everybody else  that's doing the show, huh?  Yeah, absolutely.  You're in charge of  running things and moving it along.  You can't just hang out.  I'm just hanging out.  It's just hanging out.  It's fun.  This is how it is.  Where is this going to?  I don't know.  I don't even know  if anyone's listening.  This is on a satellite.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  She doesn't even know  we're on satellite radio.  No, I don't.  I don't know what a satellite is.  What do you want us to do?  Take a break?  Yeah, let's try that.  All right, we're going to take a break.  We're going to send it back to New York 
[02:11:30]  and then we're going to pop in, what,  in about a half hour or so?  What are you guys doing?  We're riveting.  I don't know how they're going to be able  to turn away right now.  Well, we want to see Voss start the show.  Welcome to you, Joe.  Thank God you stopped by.  All right, guys.  We're live from Vegas  and go fuck yourselves.  We'll be back.  Well, it's continuing backstage action.  This is Than and Sam in New York  getting ready to throw it to Las Vegas 
[02:12:00]  where the first virus tour event of 2007 is happening.  It's an exciting time.  Yes.  Who's down there ready to take over?  Hey, could you guys sound just a little more excited?  Holy shit.  It's Than and Sam back in New York.  It's Opie and Anthony, Patrice,  and Frank Caliendo backstage here  at the Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel  and Casino in Vegas.  You guys having fun down there or what?  There's the excitement.  That's exciting. 
[02:12:30]  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Backstage must be exciting.  Is it electric?  Could you paint a picture for us?  We're in a room.  There's gaudy leopard-skin fucking carpet  that's probably been splooged on 8,000 times.  And we're watching...  Ralphie Mays on stage.  Ralphie Mays right on stage right now.  Yeah, Otto and George kicked off the show  after Rich Voss.  And...  Well, no, like Rich Voss...  I didn't mean... 
[02:13:00]  Bonnie's ready to kill me.  Bonnie's like six months pregnant.  She's about to kick my ass.  No, Rich Voss went on.  He killed.  And he's doing more of an MC thing.  And then Otto and George went on stage  and he got huge laughs,  even though Patrice is very disturbed  with his technique.  Otto and George...  He should be sued  for calling him a ventriloquist  to get together  and beat his fucking ass.  I mean, beat him to death.  He not only moves his mouth, 
[02:13:30]  you see the tongue going up and down  on the palate.  Isn't that like some guy  calling himself a magician  and then pulling the old  separating your thumb  from your finger thing  that you do for eight-year-olds?  Remember when you was a kid  and you used to try ventriloquism  and you try to say...  He still says...  Like...  He still says...  You know, you try to...  He should try to just wiggle his ears. 
[02:14:00]  Otto and George...  Hey, Rich, how's the crowd?  You've been on stage.  They're great.  They're just...  They're great.  How is it right now?  I'm not downstairs.  I'm up here.  So how do I...  I mean, when you...  But it was downstairs...  Stop trying to always gain  a drop of confidence off of me.  I'm on your side.  I know.  All I want to know  is you came from upstairs.  All right.  Stop looking around and waiting.  Listen first.  Listen, don't...  I'm not...  I'm trying to teach you  how to be a human being.  You was downstairs for a second  and I just want to know  how the crowd was. 
[02:14:30]  Okay, I was answering.  I said they were great.  Then you said,  how are they now?  They're great, great.  Okay?  How many greats do you want,  you fucking idiot?  Stop trying to muster up emotion.  Yeah, how about you give us  more than they're great?  Okay, well,  the guy in the fourth row...  He's a little drunk right there.  That one.  They're a fucking good crowd.  What do you want?  I don't know the psyche of them.  They're good.  They laughed.  They're good.  This is going to be a long summer.  I noticed...  Oh, I know.  So first night out 
[02:15:00]  and we're at each other's throats  back here.  Remember last year  it was all new  and exciting?  Oh, love was in the air.  This is the first date  and I'm like,  oh, this is going to suck.  Rich,  I do want to bring one thing up.  You decided  you were comfortable enough  to hit with some  of the racial humor  which I noticed  went over huge.  How do you feel  in the light of the  Imus controversy  that pulling out  that racial humor  and it working for you?  Listen,  no matter what happened,  basically people  still do hate minorities. 
[02:15:30]  So it's good.  You know,  hatred doesn't go away  in four or five days.  Now it's legal.  Very good.  This is the thing  I've been telling you about.  This is the thing.  This is the thing.  It makes it legal.  It makes it legal now.  White people are having  a revolution.  You're not going to  stand for it anymore.  Obi brought up  a great point  the other day.  I did?  Unfortunately,  and it would suck  because it's a great  loss of lives. 
[02:16:00]  We need something  like another 9-11  to bring the country  back together.  Remember how white  and black people  were in love?  I was driving down  the street  and I was,  if somebody tried  to get in the lane  in front of me,  I didn't care what race  they were.  I was like,  you go ahead.  We're all Americans  here suffering together.  Now it's just like  we're right back  to where we were.  Back to normal.  Wipe right back  to fuck you cracker  and an F you  nappy headed hoe.  If they take Arabs 
[02:16:30]  away from my comedy,  I'm quitting.  You're done.  If they make a movement  with Arabs,  have a stand,  you're not going to  call me that anymore.  It's like,  I'm quitting.  Girls,  you don't do it right.  You can be outsourced  at any time.  Girls,  you want some  Indian chick  sucking dick?  I don't think so.  Come on.  There you go.  You're going to get  sued now for  rebroadcasting by that.  Yeah,  I know.  Ralphie's going to  sue me.  Permission.  Hey,  Patrice,  wait,  what did you say 
[02:17:00]  about Ralphie May,  though?  I'm not saying  what I said  about Ralphie May.  Yes,  you are.  Yes,  you are.  I said Ralphie  looked like he had  stomach gum.  Instead of a  stomach clip.  Instead of stomach  staples,  stomach paper clips.  Now he's going to  hate me.  He had stomach tape.  Ralphie's not going  to hate you.  We were at the  picture.  I'm talking about  him behind his  fat back.  We've got to do  shows together.  Jesus Christ.  It's on.  We beat everyone 
[02:17:30]  up.  What a piece of shit.  I told you you  don't like me that  much.  That's the best part  of this whole thing.  It's on.  You've got to be  shitting me.  That's nothing.  Your battle and  Ralphie May is  nothing compared to  what the fuck is  going down with the  Rogan-Mencia thing.  Holy shit.  Is Mencia going to do  it?  Yeah.  Mencia is doing  dates that Rogan's  not doing.  Oh my God.  But Rogan is not  as mad.  Rogan's real like  magical now.  He's not what  people think he's  going to do.  Rogan is all into  magic.  You've got to talk  to him, man. 
[02:18:00]  He's not the same.  He's a kind of  general Rogan.  The guy's a  fucking animal.  He's an animal  that has decided  he's tired of  eating animals.  He's a vegetarian  lion.  Rogan is chilling,  man.  Trust me.  I can't wait  to tell Ralphie  what you said  about it.  Oh, fuck you,  man.  Are you going  to rat out  fucking Patrice?  Ralphie's a  fucking rat.  A lamb that  started eating  meat.  He does more  fat jokes than  anyone in the  room, Ralphie May. 
[02:18:30]  We were at the  Pink Taco and  all he did was  make fun of his  fatness.  That's self-deprecating.  I understand.  You know that.  I understand that.  You know that's a  ploy.  Oh, God.  It's a ploy for what?  Stole it.  Meaning to get  your soap before  somebody else gets  you.  But, dude, that's a  great line that he  got his stomach  stapled.  Instead of staples,  he used paper  clans.  Because we all  thought the  treats given.  It is pretty  funny.  Dude, we all  thought the same  thing when we saw  Ralphie May.  We're like, damn, 
[02:19:00]  what happened?  He was looking  good for a while  there.  What do they  call it?  What's the  umbrella name for  all that shit?  Like staples and  gastric vitals.  No, no, no.  In the office.  In the office.  The umbrella name  for all the  office shit.  I don't know  what you're  at.  Staples.  Pencils.  Oh, right.  Stationary.  Stationary.  What happened?  Dude, who said  at lunch we were 
[02:19:30]  at the Pink Taco  and Ralphie announced  that he's going to  be a father and  someone turned to  Ralphie and said,  are you carrying  the kid?  Who said that?  I did.  Yeah, Bonnie.  And then Ralphie  went on a whole  empire, what are  the penguins?  Yeah, the empire  penguin.  Yeah, he had some  good comebacks.  Emperor penguin.  Emperor, thank you.  Yes, yes.  It's okay, enough  watching this whole  thing.  Wait, Patrice,  before you leave,  why don't you talk  about Anthony's  clothing before you  head down the hall  issue there. 
[02:20:00]  Let me just explain  something to you  about Anthony.  And here's the  thing, people think  I'm a complete dick  and I'm not.  I just notice things.  I've been waiting  to be called out  on this anyway.  I've been noticing  when Anthony's  dressed, because the  thing is, Anthony  has gotten by  somehow being a  working man.  And he said,  fuck it.  Now he has a  stylist, but he's  pretending that his  stylist is not his  stylist as his  girlfriend, but his  girlfriend is his  fucking stylist.  Now today, I saw him  at the pool, he had  on a Burberry shirt.  Now, Burberry to  me, like when black 
[02:20:30]  people, and this is  it, when black people  have a stylish shirt,  this is how you know  he's losing touch.  If I have a Burberry  shirt, that  motherfucker says,  Burr fucking  Berry.  Like, motherfucking  Burberry, nigga.  That's what I'm  wearing, right?  He had, I looked at  him, I said, this  shirt is awful, more  than cotton.  Like, you know that  blend and it's just  special.  And I said, Dan,  what is this?  This is awful.  And it had a small,  teeny Burberry.  Like, Burberry.  You couldn't even,  you couldn't even  notice the Burberry.  I said, this  motherfucker is a  rich white man now. 
[02:21:00]  So I said, alright,  I'll let that go,  whatever.  You know, he goes,  he goes, my girl  bought it for me.  I go, good enough.  Then, boom, boom.  Coming here today, he  has on boutique jeans,  those, those, those  boutique type of jeans.  Like, like, oh, it's  they're hip, but they're  not.  Understated hip shit.  And he got a  perfect shirt, his  fucking shirt is  perfect.  No hat.  No one knows  Anthony without a  fucking hat.  I said, what's  going on?  I said, here's what  you do, Anthony.  I'm not trying to  cause trouble.  Just watch your  girl.  She's dressing you  like people she 
[02:21:30]  likes.  All I'm saying,  people go, oh,  what's he doing?  I'm like, Anthony,  be careful.  I noticed they're  watching shows like,  like, uh,  Superstition or  Supernatural.  That's the one.  New shit with  young, magical  motherfuckers.  Yeah, young guy.  Like, you know, it's  like, she doesn't  watch it, but it's  like the OC guys.  Well, you know,  things like that.  You don't, how do  you like Justin?  Justin, um, you  know, Schmugglesworth  who stars in whatever  the stupid shows are.  And, and I'm just, 
[02:22:00]  you're very crisp.  No, I'm, uh, Bobby.  Yeah, Bobby.  You're very crisp.  Very, you look good,  but it ain't you.  That's just  something going on.  Patrice said,  she's dressing me  like I'm another guy.  Yeah.  Like I should be  someone else.  I just noticed  shit like that.  You gotta step on  shit like that.  And Patrice, how  far is he away  from tin knocking  you were saying?  He's, he's a  Star Wars year.  Whatever year is  in Star Wars, he's,  you know the words  when the words go up?  Dude.  He's in a galaxy, 
[02:22:30]  he's a galaxy far,  far away from  fucking air  conditioners.  He, he, he,  dude, we work that  angle every day  on the show.  What the common  man?  But I don't know  how he remembers  how to relate to  these fucking  working class boobs.  That's a lifetime  ago at this point.  How do you fucking  do it?  You like go,  hey Anthony,  he goes,  ah yeah,  I remember back  in the day and  oh man,  I almost got my  head cut off  and now I'm just  like,  oh,  bur,  what's this shit?  Farumph? 
[02:23:00]  Farumph.  Yeah, Burberry  and she,  well,  she knows what  to buy.  Hey,  this is really  cool.  Okay,  forget it.  It is,  I wanted to go,  I just,  I'm just saying  to you,  keep your eye out.  All right.  I'll have to watch  Patrice.  Keep your eye out  on this situation.  Not that she  doesn't love you  anymore,  but I'm just  saying.  Well,  and on the other  hand,  I'll say how  Patrice will sit  there and watch 
[02:23:30]  me and my  girlfriend talk  and it is like  aliens.  speaking to each  other.  Patrice has no  understanding of  how a healthy  couple actually  communicates.  Like,  she feels so  comfortable talking.  Like,  I make my girl  feel uncomfortable  to even have a  thought.  Like,  and she just,  you know,  kind of go,  it's okay,  sweetie,  go ahead and,  you know,  I saw bats.  Yeah,  yeah.  I saw bats.  And he goes,  yeah,  it's crazy bats,  a lot of scorpions  and stuff.  And I'll be like,  bitch,  if you don't shut  the fuck up 
[02:24:00]  about bats,  you see people in  here,  you fucking  make me look  bad.  How can your  sense of human  be worse than  mine?  My girl's just  talking about how,  you know,  we're in Las  Vegas here,  so she saw a  bat on a tree.  Yeah.  And she goes,  you know,  there was a bat  out there earlier.  And I go,  yeah,  it's Nevada.  You know,  there's scorpions  and all kinds of  other animals like  that.  And Patrice is  looking at us  with this disgusted  look on his face  like,  I would be  telling my  bitch,  fuck the bats,  dummy.  But it's not,  it's not disgusted, 
[02:24:30]  Anthony.  It's,  wow,  I wish I could  just have that  with my girl.  Like,  I try to teach her  how to tell a story.  At least you  just start talking.  My girl will go,  this is funny.  So it puts pressure  on me to give a fuck  about what she's saying.  This is great.  Bats,  ugh.  I want a,  I want a wooden one  right now  so I can hit you  in your knee  for being this  comfortable.  And it's your fault,  Anthony.  That's why you're  dressing like  Nick Lachey now. 
[02:25:00]  There he goes,  Patrice O'Neal.  Patrice.  Patrice, man.  We'll see you  on Heidi and  Colts next week,  buddy.  We need another  white guy to  fuck up.  The new  fucking spokesman  for the black man.  By the way,  we went on,  what,  Fox News.  Fox News out here  in Vegas.  It's going to be  on at 10 o'clock,  I guess.  I want to warn  Eric Logan.  Yeah.  We followed  none of your  directions.  Eric Logan  sent this,  what I considered  a panicky Pete  email to us  that had 
[02:25:30]  talking points.  It was called  How to Handle the Media.  Yeah.  Just in case  the media asks you  about the Imus  situation,  here's what you say.  And it was like  almost a script  of how we should  react to these  questions.  And I looked at it  and said,  there is no  fucking way  I am saying  this shit.  We're all  appalled by  the situation  at hand.  And we realized  the poor  members of that  basketball team  were disgraced  and dishonored.  And I'm like,  I'm not saying  this. 
[02:26:00]  Dude,  he told me to  downplay it  and all that  and just avoid  the whole Imus thing.  Oh,  God.  Well,  I got my  Imus t-shirt.  He's got an  Imus t-shirt on.  I'm coming to my  room only 15  minutes before  the press conference.  Walk out and  ka-ching,  ka-ching,  ka-ching,  ka-ching.  And Elo,  I got to say,  in that interview,  I don't know how  long it lasts,  but we dropped  the N-bomb about  eight times.  Eight times.  Eight times.  Eight times.  Oh.  Actually calling  the reporter one.  Even though he  wasn't even one.  He wasn't even.  I didn't care.  It was close enough. 
[02:26:30]  Elo's like  shaking now,  thinking we did it.  Did you really?  Well,  you didn't really do it.  I got upset  even when people  would be defending  Imus,  but they'd always  be like,  I mean,  obviously the  statement was  disgusting,  and I'm not  behind it,  and it's gross,  but he should be  able to say  what he wants to say.  It's like,  shut up.  It's like the  same thing when  Jesse Jackson  was being interviewed.  I think it was  Katie Couric.  And she said,  she was like,  you know,  I have to ask  you this,  and I apologize.  Right,  I've heard that.  Some people  have been saying, 
[02:27:00]  but the,  and I apologize,  please.  Oh,  fuck,  accept my apology.  You said  Jaime Town.  I know you said  Jaime Town once.  I'm sorry I have  to bring this up.  It's an apology  before you're  asking someone  a question about  something that he  did that was  awful.  Why is she  fucking apologizing?  I didn't know  Jaime was a  juicelur.  Now I got  another one,  which is great.  I learned something.  Now throw that  out whenever you  want.  They're teaching  us some great 
[02:27:30]  slurs.  I'm pretty psyched.  We're learning  them all from  the news people  now that love  saying that.  I was watching  the talking  heads on the  news talk  about the  Ima situation.  They said  the N-word.  Then they  went with  the F-word.  Then they  said the B-word  and the S-word  all during the  interview.  Not the actual  words.  The new F-word  or the old  F-word?  Well,  you know,  fag.  Hey,  hey,  easy.  Instead of  saying bitch  during this  interview piece,  they said the  B-word.  You can say  bitch,  right?  Not on TV.  No,  no.  If it refers 
[02:28:00]  to women,  you can't say  it.  Right.  If it refers  to a dog,  you're fine.  They were  trying to get  Michael Savage,  the talk show  host,  in trouble,  and he called  Barbara Walters  some type  of slut.  Yeah.  So they  were trying  to refer  to that  on this  piece  and said  the S-word.  Oh,  no.  But the S-word  is shit,  not slut.  That's shit.  They actually  said S-word  on TV.  But don't you  think the news  is like using  all this to  play back  everything they  can?  Like they're  playing back  every possible.  It's like  they're using  it to get  ratings now. 
[02:28:30]  They're playing  back things  from 10,  15 years ago  and pretending  like that is  now in the  topic.  Yeah.  Because it  was outrageous  10 years ago.  Right.  Just what  about the  kids with  their hips  going in  that hula hoop?  It is  I'm outraged  at the way  the children  rock and roll.  Did you see  Elvis on TV?  His hip and  leg were moving.  Right.  Oh,  can I use  the H-word  for hips?  They don't,  yeah,  there's too many,  there's not  enough letters  in the alphabet  to describe 
[02:29:00]  the words  they want to  describe.  They're going  to have to  just spell  them out  completely.  U-F-S-H-L-O-P-R-O-F-L-I.  Rolling on the  phone laughing  and I'm like  what?  Faggot?  What?  Give me your mic.  Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy's a little shy.  No,  I'm not.  Don't push  the shyness out.  Jimmy,  we don't even know  if this is on the air.  We're just fucking around.  Yeah,  we don't care.  We don't care.  It's XM.  We phone it in  every day.  This is the casual show.  My favorite thing  still is Patrice 
[02:29:30]  saying some people  think I'm a dick  but I just notice things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's probably  my favorite thing  of all he said,  rip it on you.  Just when he just  described himself  a little bit  and what he actually  thinks about Patrice.  We all notice things.  Patrice will make you  second guess  everything you've  learned in your life.  You'll listen to him  talk for a few minutes  and you'll sit there  and go,  fuck,  I think he's right  because it sounds  so logical  and then you smack  yourself and go,  no,  stop it.  It's Patrice. 
[02:30:00]  He's a psychopath.  Can anybody notice  a comment on that  fucking horrible  attempt at hiding  obesity with wearing  a loud shirt  that Bob Kelly has?  Bob Kelly is wearing  what amounts to  a stained glass window  on his shirt.  It's a black shirt  with some religious  icons on it.  There's 80,000 things.  I think if you cross  your eyes and look  at it right,  you'll see a sailboat.  That's the magic eye shirt.  Hey,  that's a magic eye joke.  I appreciate that one,  Ant. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah,  he's...  He used to be so pretty.  What happened  to Ralphie May?  What do you mean?  He had his stomach  staple that's not really  working.  No,  not at all.  Where is he?  He's not in the room.  He's not making  the back of these steps.  Frank,  don't leave the room.  We'll talk about you next.  Just sit right there.  The only thing  that's good about this  is on this show,  I'm actually almost average.  Yeah.  I'm right in the middle  on this show.  Yeah,  you're too like ordinary  to even goof on.  Yeah,  I'm just somewhat fat. 
[02:31:00]  There are people  that are hugely fat  on this show.  Yeah,  yeah.  He had his stomach  stapled with  apple pie staples.  Has Robert Kelly  always been this thick?  No.  So this is new.  His torso doesn't bend.  Bob squats  and his torso  stays the same.  It's like an  emperor penguin.  He's uncomfortable  to look at.  He was a beautiful  young man.  Oh,  he was.  With that flowing hair,  juicy lips.  He was slender.  And now look, 
[02:31:30]  he actually is like,  he's like the head  of one of those,  if you watch a kung fu movie,  he's like the head guy  that sits there  as the head of the syndicate.  He looks like an Asian gentleman.  I think we're allowed  to play like 10 seconds.  Girls,  that's the problem.  You know nothing  about the dick.  You know nothing.  You think you do,  but you fucking don't.  You know the hard dick,  the thing you sit on  to make cookie dough,  whatever this movie is.  Oh my God.  And he's swinging  his hips around. 
[02:32:00]  It looks like crammed  and learning to mambo.  Mambo,  my grandmother  never did this.  Oh my God.  Ralph Cram.  Oh,  he's awful.  Is all we're going to do  is sit back here  and pick apart  everybody that's on this show?  What else is there to do?  How many fat people  in a row are we going to have?  Fucking Ralphie,  him,  and then Patrice.  We just want the audience  to feel it all.  Jesus,  you see some of those guys  out there?  Dude, 
[02:32:30]  we were saying earlier,  like last year,  the tour was new  and exciting,  right?  This year,  we're up to day one  and we're already like,  oh,  this is going to be  a long summer.  Frankie just trashing  everyone.  Everyone's trashing  each other.  I'm scared  to leave the room now.  Yeah,  don't leave.  Whoever leaves the room  gets it.  Don't leave the room.  Kenny.  Club Soda Kenny,  everyone.  I've already had my clothes  goofed on,  though.  Yeah,  I think we're on XM.  We're not really sure  if they're broadcasting this,  but how's the show going?  And don't say terrific.  The greatest comedy show 
[02:33:00]  in the world.  Yeah,  he announced this  as the,  what?  The greatest comedy show  ever or something like that?  It was up there.  One of those.  Give us something  that people could appreciate  at home.  I'm just so happy  to be here in Vegas  with you guys.  We're having a great time.  The show is going good.  Everybody's funny  and laughing  and you guys are doing  what you do best,  talking into microphones.  Finally,  I feel good about  what I've added to the show.  That's actually  Kenny's positivity quota  for April. 
[02:33:30]  But you know,  it could change  at the turn of a,  oh,  there's a nor'easter.  Any second now,  things could go  horribly wrong.  He's gloom and doom,  Kenny.  Dude,  my girl was a little nervous  on the plane  coming out to Vegas,  right?  So I go,  Kenny,  can you help me out  a little bit?  Just talk to her  because you've flown a lot.  It's a bumpy ride.  He told one story  about wind shears  where they almost crashed  back in the old days.  Almost crashed?  When he was like  touring with Dice.  And then he tells  another story  where he was on a plane 
[02:34:00]  with a dead guy.  I'm like,  hey,  Kenny,  thanks for the help.  I really appreciate it.  You're really cheering  the girl up.  What was the dead guy  on the plane story again?  Well,  the bottom line was  the poor old guy  died of a heart attack  and we had to like  get like diverted  to Washington, D.C.  Was it in midair  you backed out of the gate?  No,  it was in midair.  We took off from Newark.  You know how like  the first class  and like the people  with assistants go first?  Yeah.  So I'm going down  the thing with the old man,  you know,  with the walker  and everything  and I'm just annoyed now 
[02:34:30]  because it takes a long time  to follow the old guy  and then I was sitting  in first class luckily  and he was in the first row  of last class  because that's where  they put like  special needs people  and as soon as we take off  I tried to fall asleep  and I noticed a bunch  of commotion behind me.  They got him on the floor  doing CPR  and I knew from my  training experience  he was gone.  All right?  So we had to land  in Washington, D.C.  so they could like  take him off the plane  and this poor guy  passed away  and all I'm mad about  is I'm going to miss 
[02:35:00]  my fucking connection  because I was going  from Newark  to Vegas to Reno  and I'm going to miss  my connection  because this guy  had the unmitigated goal  to die on my plane.  Everyone gets very  self-centered.  Unmitigated has an A in it.  Why, why, why, why?  Unmitigated.  Unmitigated.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So did you make  your connection?  No, no.  I had to jump  on a southwest plane.  Yuck.  You know,  that's like a plot.  The only consolation  was neither did he. 
[02:35:30]  So what is this?  This is on 202  before the Than and Sam show  or after?  Than and Sam  are like doing their thing  a little bit.  They're playing some O&A bits  and then we go live  every once in a while.  Oh, okay.  We can pop on.  Because we're in the middle  of that press conference  and it was hard to hear everyone.  You got to tell the  shitting in Bob Kelly's...  No, whose room did you...  Oh, my God.  Well, you just told it.  Yeah.  No, no, no,  but I want the details.  Oh, I was fine.  Like you were in his room  with your girlfriend? 
[02:36:00]  Yeah, we went into Bob's room.  I had to take a dump.  My girlfriend had to take a dump  and Bob had to take a dump.  So I was going to go  into his bathroom  and shit in his bathroom  and then leave it  because that's what you do  in someone's hotel room.  You just drop a log,  you fucking put the paper  around the edge  and you walk out laughing.  And fucking stupid Bob  tries to outsmart me  and he jumps in the bathroom first.  So I'm like laughing  and she goes,  shit on his bed.  And I'm like,  I can't shit on his bed.  That was your idea?  Of course it was her idea.  That's why they go out.  She told me to shit on his bed 
[02:36:30]  and I'm like,  no, I can't do that.  So I looked around  and I found his garbage can  and I couldn't,  I knew I was going  to take a dump in it  but I couldn't do it  with her looking right at me.  So I'm like,  just go outside  and I fucking dropped my pants  and I dropped,  it had to be 10 pounds of shit  in his fucking,  in the bag,  in his fucking room.  And I put it under his desk.  I was hoping it would stay there  for a while  and he'd fucking find it later  when he went to Rice smelling.  But he said like,  because he ran out,  he thought we were fucking  with his minibar  and he had no idea  I just shit in his bag.  So I guess like, 
[02:37:00]  I got a page like 15 minutes later  and he said he was fucking revolted.  He walked out of the bathroom  and he's like,  what did he do?  He didn't do nothing.  And then he walked by his desk twice  and he started to smell shit  and he fucking looked under  and he had to take the white baggie  out of the garbage bag  and he had to dump it  into the toilet.  But he said the baggie  was all crumpled up.  So when he lifted it,  the shit went,  and he had like a long fucking tube  from a fucking baggie  to dump my fucking baggie.  Fucking dark dessert 
[02:37:30]  eating logs out of him.  See,  I didn't tell that story.  That's what I wanted,  the details.  Hey,  where's Bob Kelly?  He just got off stage.  Who's up next?  Patrice?  Patrice.  Patrice is going to end  the first set or whatever.  Everyone's been doing really well.  Yeah,  absolutely.  Crowd's loving everybody.  Is Bobby out there  in the hallway?  He's coming up.  He's coming up?  Cool.  Patrice getting a huge ovation.  Crowd loves him.  Have a seat.  How will you,  sir? 
[02:38:00]  How are you?  How's everybody?  Good,  good,  good,  good.  Let's have a discussion.  I'm not the spokesman  for the white community.  That's funny,  that handy and cold shit.  That shit is just,  I just knew what was going to happen.  It's going to happen.  But listen,  let me just say,  the racial part of it,  fuck the racial part.  The nappy-headed,  we'll get over it.  We always hated each other racially.  Here's my problem.  This whole thing, 
[02:38:30]  listen,  bitches,  we have to make,  we have to figure this shit out right now.  What are women going to be in charge of?  All right,  he's doing his thing.  Yep.  Here comes Bobby.  Bobby!  There he is.  How'd it feel out there?  It was good.  I got on a mic or something.  Why were you nervous?  Why were you nervous?  Getting rave reviews in here.  Yeah.  Yeah,  we were.  Oh,  yeah.  Yeah,  he has a track.  You're fucking.  What?  Huge. 
[02:39:00]  You went over great.  Wait,  wait,  get down the mic.  Wait,  I got called skinny while you were up there.  Oh,  shit.  Your set was excellent.  Wait,  how about a mic?  Yeah,  give him a mic.  We don't have a mic.  Hey,  Bobby.  What's up,  dude?  You killed.  Yeah,  but I looked like a moose,  didn't I,  when I turned sideways?  Well,  I didn't say it.  Oh,  no.  And from the front,  I looked good.  I didn't say it.  You thought I would say it.  This is what blows me away.  I commented on his shirt  because I've been catching so much shit  from my clothes.  Why don't you tell him to his face  what you said about his shirt?  I said your shirt looks like  a stained glass window. 
[02:39:30]  You got fucking crosses on there.  Jesus,  I don't know what the hell's going on.  It looks like he was napping  and a pterodactyl shit on him.  Anthony's got a gay rodeo shirt on.  Exactly.  What are you going to do?  That wasn't a good one.  Going to the gay rodeo after this.  When you're doing the sex thing,  you ever see the guy  who's just standing there  and the cannonball gets shot  into his stomach?  Yeah.  Slow motion.  That's kind of what you look like  when you're doing it.  Wow.  Wow.  Whoa.  Whoa.  That was hurtful.  That was pretty good.  I thought it was good. 
[02:40:00]  Hold on.  Let me do it like this.  You ever say the guy  with the cannonball?  No,  it was good like you.  Keep it like that.  No,  it comes across mean  if he says it.  Bobby,  I'll comment on one part  of your show  where you were talking about  how the girl  will squat down  and start doing her thing  like gyrating  and you do the moves.  Your hips move.  Of the girl.  You move the hips and stuff.  Was it?  You really move.  And actually,  Jimmy,  Jimmy commented  on what you looked like  at that point.  Can you fill up a little bit  when I did that?  Jimmy,  what'd you say?  When you were moving  all your hips,  I said you look like 
[02:40:30]  Cramden learning  to do the mumbo.  At least I was...  You got a sweat towel.  You all right?  Dude,  it's hot up there.  Is it hot out there?  Yeah.  I have to go out there  and fucking run around  like an asshole.  I don't like the fact  that when no one's commenting  on this fucking bed sheet  hanging on a clothesline,  Oh, fucking Patrice.  It's a fucking mess.  See,  you had to come in  so now we're commenting  on you  and what we commented on.  Right.  So now Patrice is safe.  Why don't we just all  goof on Patrice now?  No,  let's stay on.  Because now you're in here.  Let's stay on me. 
[02:41:00]  He's a big black guy.  Patrice is the only one  that could get away  with dressing like that though.  Yeah.  The only one  that could wear  those big jackets  with the text on it.  They're awful.  It's like when you write a letter  but you put the font too big.  That's like every jacket he wears.  It's like that.  I appreciate what he's got written on it  but the font is much too large.  I like to thank...  Really,  no,  this is a great idea.  Put drunk assholes on stage  so half the three of your actors  will fucking threaten 
[02:41:30]  to punch you in the face.  What happened?  I almost had to fight  the fucking guy.  Why?  What happened?  Because I said something to him  and he got up like fucking...  Because he's drunk  and he doesn't know any better.  See,  there's a bar on the stage.  Well,  listen,  what I noticed...  Is he off the stage?  You might want to put  fucking VIPs on the stage  who giggle nicely  instead of fucking savages from...  This stage is too small.  They shouldn't have had people  on the stage.  Yeah,  it's tiny.  Like last summer  we had people on the stage  but the stage was massive  so it didn't really matter.  This guy got up  and balled his fist up  and I was like,  are you kidding?  I almost tried to fight  the fucking guy.  Do you know how cool 
[02:42:00]  that would have been  if he punched you?  I said something like he's...  I go,  dude,  you're fucking...  I said something like  you're skinny or whatever  and then he got up  and was going to fight me  and I was like,  fuck you  and then...  But inside I was like,  I go,  I'll have Kenny  beat the shit out of you.  How cool would it be  to watch just some guy  get pounded up there  by security?  Yeah,  Bob.  Oh,  yeah,  that's what I meant.  Bob.  See my friend  get beaten up  in front of 1,500 people?  I wouldn't help.  I would just laugh.  So would the crowd.  Wait a minute.  You couldn't help.  Leave him alone.  What are you going to do?  Go rub shit on everybody? 
[02:42:30]  That is his defense.  You're like a dung beetle.  Are we going to make it  home tomorrow  with the weather?  Yes.  Ah,  that's the big question.  We didn't even land  and Kenny was already  doom and gloom.  You know.  Did you hear the weather?  Oh,  my God.  It's supposed to be  flaming hail and frogs.  Apparently,  there's a big storm  that's been  in the Mideast,  in the Middle East.  Of course,  it's called  the Iraqi War. 
[02:43:00]  The Middle East.  Midwest.  I'm an asshole.  Midwest.  You've been playing  too many video games.  I can't even see.  I've been playing cards  for fucking hours.  And my vision  is actually blurred  from looking at bad cards  when you and Kenny  are near me.  Dude,  it wasn't me.  You're two fucking mushes.  I won.  Yeah,  you won.  I'm in my seat.  You're kryptonite  as far as luck is  for anyone else.  Well,  the mush.  The thing,  I don't like being called  a mush.  He's a very ugly,  mushy guy. 
[02:43:30]  Can we come up  with another name  like Chubby?  No.  You're bad luck.  I could really  have to lose weight.  I was up there.  I was like,  it was like I was  working out  on a pre-core machine.  What you assume  that would feel like?  TouchÃ©.  All right.  You guys are wearing  a fag cowboy shirt,  I know.  Why don't we go  watch Patrice?  We'll take a break,  right?  We've been talking  for a while.  All righty.  We'll give  Stan and Sam  a chance to say  something,  do something 
[02:44:00]  back in New York.  Why is Patrice  talking?  Who's he talking to?  He's doing his act.  He's fighting?  Is he fighting?  I don't know  if he's being heckled  or not.  He's one of the people  on the side, though.  Oh, no.  We might have to  take those people  off the stage.  Uh-oh.  All right,  put the mic up there.  Let's see what he's saying.  Hear that?  What happened?  Hear that?  Well,  we got to listen  to them guys.  Let me head in.  Steve,  who's?  First of all.  First of all?  What the fuck  are white girls  doing at that press conference  just for the whole part? 
[02:44:30]  That's great.  He's back.  All right,  he's got them back.  We'll take a break.  Maybe we'll be back.  Maybe we won't.  I think we will.  All right,  Dan and Sam,  you guys take it over.  Thanks for helping us out  back in New York.  And Bobby,  what can I say?  Frank Caliendo,  we'll see you guys  a little bit.  Thanks for out there,  Bobby.  I'm going to...  I get that.  Hang on.  Can you hear us?  Yeah.  We want to like...  We want to like  talk from behind  the stage.  We're interrupting 
[02:45:00]  your show  and we don't even care.  Good music.  Can we hear us?  Yes,  we can hear you.  Oh, hi.  All right.  Hey, guys.  We're about to go on stage.  Intermission's just about over.  We're here in Vegas,  obviously,  at the Joint  Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.  What a schizo show  for you guys.  You're doing your thing,  talking serious.  Then you throw it to us  and we're just a bunch  of dopes having fun  in Vegas.  Are Dan and Sam  rolling their eyes  like,  oh,  we can't even do  our fucking show?  It was our big  fucking moment. 
[02:45:30]  Idiots.  We're going down  a spiral staircase.  Oh,  this thing is dangerous.  And heading toward  the backstage area.  I feel like I'm on  Hunch from Red October.  Yeah,  I feel like...  It's like a submarine  stairway here.  Ugh.  Anyway,  so far the show's  been great,  Ant.  Oh,  hell yeah.  Had a lot of fun  backstage,  too.  Getting rave reviews.  I know,  that's...  We should actually  have some kind of  closed circuit TV  and just broadcast  what's going on  backstage.  And in some ways  that's even funnier  than what's going 
[02:46:00]  on the stage.  More hostility  between the comics  and us  and everyone else.  It's funny  because whoever's  on stage,  we can see him  through this TV  and we're all  just sitting around  leather couches  just beating up  the person that's  trying to do their set.  Now it's our turn  to get beat up  because we're going  to be on the TV  and they're all  going to make fun  of us.  That's exactly  what I was thinking.  I'm like,  oh,  crap.  It sucks.  Everyone was scared  to leave the room.  People were just  bingling going,  I know as soon  as I leave  they're going  to beat the crap  out of me.  They're going to start  making fun of us.  But is the second  half of the show 
[02:46:30]  about to start?  Kenny's getting  all ready  to introduce us,  give us the big intro  and then we go out  and what are we  going to do?  You got any idea?  I was thinking  maybe you'd do  some Imus  and I'll just sit there  and ride your coattails.  All right.  That's cool.  Why not?  I don't know.  We'll figure it out  as we go.  We'll say hi  to the XM audience.  We wing it.  We'll wing it.  You kidding me?  We brought like  20 videos with us  so we're like,  hey,  take a look  at the video.  Oh,  is that what 
[02:47:00]  we're going to do?  Yeah.  Cool.  There's the animation  right now?  Okay.  Three minutes.  They're playing  something called  Corporate Email.  I believe it's,  is that one up  on our websites?  Okay.  The one thing  we should tell people  that during this  tour this summer  we're going to be  using a lot of  the fans' videos  in between comedians.  There's submissions,  animations.  They take the audio  from the show  and then animate it  with Flash  and we're playing  that up on the screen  right now.  Yeah.  And this was the bit 
[02:47:30]  when,  if you remember,  we were not invited  to Company Appreciation Day,  Employee Appreciation Day  at XM headquarters  in D.C.  So we fired off  a letter to them  very angry about that  and it's a whole animation  based on that email.  Hey,  we got Patrice O'Neill.  How'd it feel out there?  It felt very well.  You got rave reviews upstairs.  They were very nice.  I gave them less  than they deserved.  I hate them so much 
[02:48:00]  that I got to learn  to love them.  How is it to just  look out at that sea  of them  and have to entertain them?  It's a lot of love.  You know,  it's a lot of love  and it's like a weird thing  because you know  how your self-esteem  will fuck your whole mind up  where crazy,  retarded white people  love you that much  and you have to  kind of just  self-destruct  and go,  this is not good for me  as a person  but you go,  they're good, man.  They give you that love  and you just got to  give them like 15 minutes  of horse shit.  That's all they want. 
[02:48:30]  A horse shit.  You know,  everyone upstairs was shocked  to like,  did Patrice actually go short?  I,  this is the only,  this,  if I do another of these tours,  I will never go over  my time again.  See?  Because this is,  short and sweet.  This is the type of thing  you look down  at that clock ticking  and you go,  okay,  you fit,  see silence for my,  for the audience I like,  like,  that come to see me,  me,  it's like,  they know that there's  a lot of silence  and a lot of talking.  Right.  These motherfuckers,  when these people are silent,  I get nervous.  I go, 
[02:49:00]  I better pull a magical dick  out of my,  out of my pocket  really quick  with sparkles  because silence  sometimes for them  but they're so good,  their silence was good.  This is,  this is,  I would say,  other than the PNC  that year,  this is,  this is,  this is good.  This is the best one.  Best just all around  good people.  Well,  these fans aren't jaded yet.  They haven't seen us  a hundred times.  This is the first time  they're seeing us live  because we've never been out west.  I was saying that last night.  We're used to going to  the parties in New York  or appearances  and you see the same people 
[02:49:30]  over and over again.  We were going through  the casino last night  and like,  girls and people  are coming up going like,  oh my God,  can I take your picture?  Oh,  I'm a huge fan.  How did Neo even get here?  Oh, Neo?  I don't know.  He's fucking flying carpet  or some shit.  What did he start?  His journey six months ago?  They put him in one of those  fucking legs eggs  that the stockings come in  and fucking tossed him.  I think we're about ready  to go on.  Patrice,  great set.  Oh,  yeah,  great job,  man.  We're moving closer to  the stage here. 
[02:50:00]  By the way,  they're enjoying the video  we're playing at,  the corporate email video.  Yes.  It's very funny.  This is also based on the fact  that with XM,  everybody in the company  decides to like,  send a mass email  to everybody in programming  like,  hey,  I brought cookies in today.  Come on by my cubicle  and grab one.  Oh,  it's a pain in the ass.  Yeah,  my tire went flat  in the parking lot.  Can someone help me  with a jack?  Right,  so it's kind of a takeoff  of that.  30 seconds.  All right,  we're moving back. 
[02:50:30]  We're going to have to  give these mics away  and get new ones.  What are we going to do?  Switch mics now?  All right.  All right,  bear with us.  We're about to go on stage.  All right,  we're going to give up  these mics,  grab the other ones,  and they'll be able  to hear us?  All right,  cool.  Ladies and gentlemen,  the moment  you've all been waiting for,  let's give a warm  Las Vegas welcome 
[02:51:00]  to my friends,  the stars of the show,  Opie and Anthony.  What's up,  Las Vegas?  Yeah,  there they are.  A standing,  oh,  look at this.  What's up,  man?  Oh,  yeah,  they're having a good time.  What's up,  yo? 
[02:51:30]  Look at this,  Anthony,  a standing O in Vegas.  How we doing,  Vegas?  Bravo,  man.  Where are the nappy-headed hoes?  Where are the nappy-headed hoes?  Come on,  where are you?  We can still say that  on the radio,  right?  You guys are enjoying the show so far?  You guys have been an unbelievable crowd.  We were just talking about that backstage. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah,  man,  thanks for showing up.  Guys,  you know,  we were a little leery about coming out west.  It's really our first time  venturing this far out west,  and you guys have been fantastic.  Unbelievable,  man.  Anthony,  speaking of which,  want to give some props to the pests out west.  The POWs in the house!  I didn't think we'd ever meet them live.  It's pretty cool walking around the casino  and meeting these guys. 
[02:52:30]  They're a loud-ass crowd.  I want to find out  which message board person  called me an asshole,  though.  Which?  That guy right there.  You motherfuckers.  I know,  you know,  they smile at you  and shake your hand,  and I love the show,  and then meanwhile,  they're back home.  You're a fucking asshole.  You're ugly,  and you're fucking...  Yeah, right?  It's like,  what the...  Why do you?  Hey,  these guys are a little too close  on the stage,  I'm thinking.  Are you guys behaving? 
[02:53:00]  Everything's good?  I saw something  that almost looked like a fight  with, uh...  Bob?  Bobby.  Bob Kelly.  So,  who was mouthing off to Bob?  I think they got rid of him.  Which guy?  He's gone.  He's gone?  What happened to your voice,  Kenny?  Kenny,  you are shot.  I know.  All of a sudden,  I don't know what happened.  He's in Vegas.  He wants to talk like  he's part of the mafia.  I don't know.  It was Bazzini.  Bazzini the whole time.  My godfather. 
[02:53:30]  That guy's a fucking mush, too.  I was playing cards,  and, uh...  And Keith,  who seems to be good luck,  Keith the cop,  he was sitting by me,  and I'm winning,  I'm doing great,  and then Keith went to go  get something to eat,  and he says,  Kenny's gonna sit with you.  Like,  I need a fucking babysitter,  first of all,  but Kenny sat with me,  and I said,  if I lose two hands in a row,  you gotta leave,  and I got two of the worst fucking hands  and sent them away,  and he had to actually walk away.  I wanted to send them  into the fucking bathroom.  Get in the bathroom, 
[02:54:00]  you fucking mush.  All right,  there's Club Soda Kenny.  Hey,  we, um...  We did a commercial  for XF Satellite Radio,  and then I think the company  ran out of money,  so you guys never saw it.  So we want to show it real fast,  and we also have some outtakes,  but...  But first,  here's the XF commercial.  A lovely pair, Anthony.  With cute Jimmy.  Pants.  Shoes.  From here to here, Anthony.  A lovely pair.  Yeah, I know,  but this doesn't play on the radio.  Hey, idiots.  Hey, idiots. 
[02:54:30]  You can say whatever you want now.  You're on XM, remember?  She had a monster set of...  The Opie and Anthony Show,  live and uncut on XM.  The perfect holiday gift.  I guess we're going to go right  into the outtakes, too.  Yeah, we didn't get it in one take.  A lovely pair.  Pair of pants.  No.  Shoes.  From here to here,  a lovely pair. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  This doesn't play on the radio.  From here to here, Anthony.  A lovely pair.  You know.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know.  I'll answer your question  before you even give it to me.  How about I do that?  Doofy.  Hey, idiots.  There's no rules here, remember?  This is XM.  Oh, well.  Oh, well.  Well...  Don't beat yourself up.  It happens. 
[02:55:30]  There's no rules here,  you silly geese.  This is XM.  Oh, good point.  Good fucking point.  What's the matter with you guys?  Right there, stop.  Should I go there or should I stop there?  Holy fucking Ralph Cramden.  And action.  Hey, guys.  You can say whatever you want now.  You're on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:56:00]  Hey, idiots.  You can say whatever you want.  You are on...  Fuck.  Hey, guys.  You can say whatever you want.  This is XM Satellite Radio.  You know, I don't want to upset you,  but this is XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, dude.  Oh, I'm just...  Hey, guys.  You're on Satellite Radio. 
[02:56:30]  And...  you can say whatever you want.  Did you know  it takes more muscles to frown  than it does to say  cunt on Satellite Radio?  Dad!  You can say whatever you want.  You're on Satellite Radio.  How do you know?  Because I'm fat like a planet. 
[02:57:00]  Ramon!  Bring these bags of shit  and acting lessons.  Oh, shit.  You fucking did that on purpose  to confuse me.  Well, shit,  a monster set of tits.  Mr. Faber-Sham,  we can't talk about tits.  Can't talk about tits.  She had a monster set of tits.  Did she? 
[02:57:30]  Jugs, ha-ha,  fun bags, cans,  hooters, honkers.  What's the way, though?  Yeah, absolutely.  Wazoo's.  Gazonga's.  At the end.  The only need to have tits  is not that far away from the middle.  Utter frustration.  Love warts.  Ew.  What the hell is wrong with tits?  What the hell is wrong with tits?  She had,  let me tell you what she had,  a monster set of tits.  There you have it. 
[02:58:00]  You guys ready for more comedy or what, huh?  On the way,  Joe Rogan and Jimmy Norton.  But first,  let's hear it for Frank Caliendo.  Frank.  Am I on?  You got it.  Rich, it's all,  the floor is yours.  Take off.  You know,  first of all,  you guys have been killing all night.  I haven't heard,  but that's,  I haven't listened,  but that's what the rumor going around is, 
[02:58:30]  that you guys are just killing.  We've been fabulous.  And let me tell you,  we're about to wrap this show up.  Everybody's destroying here.  It's unbelievable.  Patrice and I got a standing O,  mainly Patrice,  and I just walked out,  so I counted it as part of my standing O.  Patrice killed,  Bobby killed,  everybody's killed.  We're about to wrap it up.  We got some other,  Patrice,  what do you got to say?  Did you have fun out there?  Did you have a good time?  I was very,  you know,  I was telling them I was very surprised  that,  you know how you get ready for war, 
[02:59:00]  which you really didn't have to be,  and one,  this was as close to a regular bunch of people ever.  It is.  They were very regular,  like meaning,  like,  oh shit,  you could do a little comedy,  because Frank's killing,  and I'm thinking like,  oh man,  but they're just into everybody,  man,  so maybe that'll be a lesson  for the rest of these fucking maniacs  all over the country.  Well,  here's some other show days,  and here's the thing,  you're coming,  they're paying good money,  they really do want to see the show.  I mean,  all these great comics,  you know,  there was a couple,  you know,  but no one,  no one's doing bail, 
[02:59:30]  we got shows coming out,  we got Jones,  you know what,  let somebody else read them,  I don't want to slobber through this.  Here,  Arnie.  You low self esteem,  motherfucker.  Here,  you want me to go somewhere  and get some fish exercises.  Give me the,  oh gosh,  oh,  reading.  Alright,  this is it,  so the next one is Jones Beach?  Yep.  Okay,  so June 16th,  we're going to be in Jones Beach Amphitheater  in Warton,  New York.  Oh Jesus.  Maybe I better do it,  Patrice. 
[03:00:00]  So Jones,  okay,  Jones Beach Amphitheater  in Warton,  New York,  that's June 16th.  Alright,  just say the,  you know,  what are you going to give the street  and everything?  That's what it says,  Patrice.  Oh.  June 30th.  That's my birthday.  June 30th was Uncastle,  Uncastleville,  Connecticut.  It's Unkinville.  No,  it says Uncastleville.  I'm telling you.  It's Un,  yeah,  you play.  Hold on.  Alright.  Battle of the dummies over here. 
[03:00:30]  Jesus.  Who's the dummy?  You're pregnant by rich.  Mohegan's son,  June 30th,  Tweeter Center,  Mansfield,  Massachusetts.  Massachusetts.  It's no,  July 21st,  that one.  On August 4th,  the DTE Energy Pavilion  in Detroit,  Michigan.  The Nissan Pavilion  is next,  August 18th,  Bristow,  Virginia.  This is so uncomfortable.  PNC Bank Arts Center,  somewhere in New Jersey,  August 25th. 
[03:01:00]  Homedell.  Homedell.  And the Tweeter Center,  Camden,  New Jersey,  September 15th.  Wow.  Well,  it's good.  Some shows  got more people  than others,  but they all look good.  It's going to be  your favorite  O&A regulars,  special guests.  And let me tell you,  this kickoff show  was,  we couldn't have done this  in a great place  to kick it off.  It was a great time.  I'm telling you,  this was an event  that I will never forget  after tomorrow. 
[03:01:30]  Are we supposed to read  the people that's going  to be in each one or no?  No.  No?  No.  Look,  it's not the SATs.  I'm just saying,  Bob Saget.  Okay,  put it this way.  Some of the people  who aren't here  that's going to be  on some of the other ones.  Bob Saget,  Stephen Lynch,  Louis C.K.  Caliendo's on a few of them.  Carlos Macias is going  to be there.  Anyone that Joe Rogan's  not on,  Carlos Macias will be there.  So,  oh,  Caliendo's on all of them.  And then you got Saget,  and then that's it. 
[03:02:00]  Nobody else,  no special guests.  They have negotiations  with other comics, too.  Open negotiations?  Yeah.  All right,  so it looks like,  you know,  it's about the same  cast of characters  with like a little  Louis C.K.  is in there,  Frank Caliendo,  and a little Bob Saget  and a little Carlos  Ben.  Well,  can't say the C word,  here.  But,  you know,  we call him  CM while Joe's here.  We call him CM  when Joe's here,  he's CM.  When Joe's not here,  it's that old crazy  mind,  the mind,  mind,  mind. 
[03:02:30]  What's in my mind?  Are there people?  No.  Oh,  shit,  no.  Don't do that.  I didn't do it.  But,  all right,  so wrap it up,  rap boy.  How much fun  do we have?  It was,  we got to go.  Anything,  Don,  you need any information?  Anything else?  Just like some special ending?  If you're happy,  if you're happy,  if you're happy,  if you're happy.  Oh,  oh,  no.  He's puking.  It's the baby bird.  Oh,  shit.  Oh,  he's puking.  I can't watch this dirty shit.  Oh, 
[03:03:00]  wow.  Wow.  This is the only thing.  Oh,  turn your head.  Don't look at it.  What the hell is wrong with her?  Don't look at it.  Oh.  Don't.  You gotta see it.  You gotta see it.  I can't look at that baby bird.  You gotta see this.  Don't look at it.  You gotta see it.  Why are you looking at it?  Wait,  wait,  that's all puking at the guy's head.  Wait.  Oh,  fuck me,  man. 
[03:03:30]  Oh.  I know.  I can feel it.  Oh.  Oh,  we're watching the eggnog challenge.  That would just,  I would die.  How is it?  Is I doing?  I would just die.  Oh,  shit.  Body just delivered.  All right.  Hey,  yo,  man.  We'll see you at some of these shows,  man.  Next one is June 18th at,  yeah,  Jones Beach,  June 18th,  man,  at the amphitheater,  man.  So,  anyway,  we'll see you, 
[03:04:00]  man,  on all these dates,  and thanks a lot for coming to these shows.  Rick Fox,  amazon.com.  I can smell it.  I can smell it.  Well,  thanks,  Voss,  for giving us your opinion on that issue.  Of course,  I'm only kidding.  The Opie Anthony traveling virus tour is coming across the country this summer.  That was Voss from Las Vegas backstage at the traveling virus tour.  Yes.  Awesome.  Yeah,  that,  just to quickly wrap that up,  I'm not sure if the plugs quite got out there correctly, 
[03:04:30]  but just a real quick refresher that the tour is going to be in Jones Beach,  June 16th,  Mohegan Sun,  the 30th of June,  Tweeter Center in Mansfield near Boston,  July 21st,  the DC area,  the Nissan Pavilion,  August 18th,  PNC in Jersey,  August 25th,  and the Tweeter Center in Camden,  September 15th.
