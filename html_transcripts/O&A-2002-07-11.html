<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a robust segment of their "WOW Contest," featuring on-air judging of submitted women's photos. Opie, Anthony, Stinky, Ben, and Rick eliminated contestants,  introducing a new model from Atlanta, Nora, who was photographed in studio.  A major focus was their upcoming trip to Buffalo for OzFest, promising arrests due to planned activities including strip clubs, a porn star with "sex toys," various contests (wet t-shirt, bikini, mullet, man-boob, best ass, hairy back, beer gut, and whipped cream licking), and a scantily clad women's volleyball tournament. Hayseed Dixie, the show's house band, provided a musical backdrop with their bluegrass-style AC/DC covers.

A recurring joke centered around Tippy Tom, a homeless man who was scheduled to be a guest but was hospitalized with a severely infected leg.  The hosts engaged in much speculation, using offensive language, about the events leading to his injury.  Ben frequently interjected with detailed, and crudely described, accounts of celebrity sightings during his laundry runs.  A caller, Angie (contestant #98), protested her elimination from the WOW Contest, resulting in a humorous and vulgar exchange.

The planned surprise for Tippy Tom (later revealed to be a male stripper from Hunk-tasia) was cancelled due to his hospitalization with gangrene.  The hosts offensively joked about potentially using his amputated leg as a display item. The conversation frequently devolved into sexually explicit and offensive discussions about Tippy Tom's sexuality, their own drinking habits, and graphic details of his injuries.  Sabrina, a WOW Contest contestant, called to withdraw from the competition.  Steve, another listener, eliminated a contestant he found unattractive.  A phone call with the hospitalized Tippy Tom ensued, contrasting his sober demeanor with previous intoxicated appearances.  Audio clips of Tippy Tom's past homophobic and sexually graphic rants were played, alongside a childhood story involving genital burns and resulting hemorrhoids. The male stripper, initially stuck downstairs due to elevator phobia, eventually made it to Tippy Tom's hospital room where he gave Tippy Tom a lap dance.  The lack of music during this event and subsequent photos were noted.  The hostsâ€™ Appalachian heritage, firearm use, and the belief that alcohol reduced Tippy Tom's perceived "gayness" were recurring comedic elements.

The in-studio lap dance fueled further homophobic slurs and crude sexual humor.  The WOW Contest continued, with contestants eliminated by Opie, Anthony, Rick, and a caller, Sabrina (who used a "Harry Caray" self-elimination to then eliminate another contestant).  Eliminations were based on subjective assessments of physical appearance, focusing heavily on breast size.  Disagreements regarding judging fairness emerged amongst the hosts.  Hayseed Dixie performed again, interweaving their set with discussions of their alcohol consumption and upcoming gigs.  The "F.U. Line" allowed listeners to air grievances. A Hunk-tasia representative called to promote their services and discuss various clients and events.  Further WOW Contest eliminations and a listener's picture assessment concluded the segment.  The show ended with discussion of a news story about a man arrested for filming police brutality and a long segment consisting solely of repeated instances of "Thank you" at 30-second intervals.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is Ozzy Osbourne, and you're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  Today was yesterday, because yesterday was so close, like almost like it was the same day.  That's right, and welcome to the O.P. and Anthony show. We gotta get right into it today.  Almost.  We got this radio show, and we got too much to do lately.  Yeah, you know.  How did this happen?  I don't know.  I like the old days where we had maybe one thing we wanted to cover every day.  Yeah.  And then we made up everything else as we went along. 
[00:00:30]  We're hitting the road again, bro.  Yeah, I know.  We're doing this show, and then tonight we leave.  We'll be in Philly for OzFest tomorrow.  Rock.  We got a great show planned for tomorrow in Philly.  Yeah.  Backstage at OzFest.  And then we jump on a plane after OzFest and make our way to Buffalo.  We go to Buffalo, man.  For a gig on Saturday.  T and A with O and A.  T and A with O and A in Buffalo. 
[00:01:00]  Did you read the whole rundown of events and everything?  I was looking at that last night.  Oh, my God.  Well, where is the list?  Do you have the list in front of you, Ben, or can you get it?  The list of stuff that is going to be going on.  It sounds like Sodom and Gomorrah.  I love it.  Now, we don't want to bore you with all the stuff we're doing in Buffalo, but it's cool  because we take a lot of video and pictures, and we'll put them up on the website so everyone  around the country can share.  There's at least three or four events on that list that could get us arrested. 
[00:01:30]  I know.  I'm looking going, what the?  All right.  I'm game for this.  The latest, I got a phone call from John Paul.  He's the PD up there at WBUF in Buffalo.  Yeah.  He leaves this message.  He's so excited.  One of the strip clubs has a XXX porn star featuring at one of the strip clubs this weekend.  She's coming to the T and A with O and A thing.  To hang out?  To hang out, and she's bringing her toys.  I love it.  Come on.  That's great. 
[00:02:00]  Her toys.  Her toys.  All right.  So in front of 2,000 or 3,000 people, we'll have this XXX porn star with her toys, and  then there's a thing we're going to do that I'm sure Pete is going to have a problem with.  Yeah.  And a few other things, and then girls are going to be playing volleyball with, I don't  know, just bikinis on.  Oh, here it is.  Throughout the day, we're going to have a wet t-shirt contest in Buffalo, a whipped cream  bikini contest in Buffalo, a best mullet or worst mullet contest in Buffalo. 
[00:02:30]  That's an easy one for Buffalo.  Especially for the gang in the suburbs there.  A man boob contest, a best ass contest, chicks only, of course, hairy back contest, best  beer gut contest, best wow contest, whipped cream licking contest.  Whipped cream licking contest.  Porn stars.  Yeah.  Strippers.  They got airline tickets to Los Angeles and New Orleans to give it away.  Tickets to see Sammy and Dave. 
[00:03:00]  Tickets to see the guess who?  Tickets to see the guess who?  Is that like tickets to see the guess who?  I will guess.  Or is it the guess who?  Tickets to see.  I will guess tickets to see Metallica.  All right.  Good.  All right.  Guess who?  So tickets to see Metallica.  Tickets to see Cheap Trick.  And tickets to Rockfest 2002.  It's going to be a great event in Buffalo.  Yeah.  And then I was reading other things that are going on.  They got that.  They labeled it the hot, hot chick volleyball game. 
[00:03:30]  It's going to be going on.  Yeah.  Just hot chicks against hot chicks.  Playing volleyball.  It's a volleyball tournament.  Yeah.  Basically, it's just going to be a booze fest.  And then lots of drinking.  Lots of debauchery.  We just got it off the website, Ben.  But thank you.  Sorry about that.  All right.  There you go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But we got to get through today's show before we start our little road trip, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  And outside the studio, they're warming up.  We got a house band today. 
[00:04:00]  We got the house band today.  We got Hayseed Dixied.  Hayseed Dixied.  Actually, Hayseed Dixie.  Dixie.  I always get that wrong.  Dixie.  So do I.  We've had them on the show.  We played the CD before.  And they do ACDC songs.  Yeah.  Well, we're very inimitable style.  Well, they're plugging in.  They're going to be the house band today.  Yeah.  Also on the show, top 50 worst movies of all time.  We're going to go over that list a little bit.  Wow Contest continues, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Let me pop that up.  I want to see if there's any new contestants.  Girls continue qualifying.  That's fine.  We're not stopping at 100 because we've got to follow the rules.  But we are starting to knock girls out of the WOW Contest.  Yep.  Yesterday, a lot of controversy because Anthony and I got right on the air and we booted  10 girls from the contest.  10 girls gone.  Well, today we're doing it a little different.  Yeah.  Just a little different because we've got to make more room for hot chicks.  Wow.  Yeah.  We've got a couple of professionals that joined the contest overnight. 
[00:05:00]  They're from Vegas and they work at, I don't know, a place called the Bunny Ranch  or something.  Oh, is that it?  And supposedly the photo shoot was really interesting yesterday in Las Vegas.  I bet.  I'm getting reports that it was off the hook, as they say.  Great.  And they got another, I think they only have two girls so far out of the 30 that are showing  up in the next day or two.  Okay.  Today, Anthony, we're going to get rid of at least five or six more girls from the WOW  Contest.  Yeah.  A little different though.  A little different.  A lot of people thought that, uh, at night, you know, we, we were showing a little too 
[00:05:30]  much power yesterday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're getting a little caught up in the moment of, uh, throwing off some of the girls.  A lot of emails saying, how dare you guys?  More emails completely agreeing though.  Yeah.  The fact that they should have been thrown off.  Definitely.  But you have the, the people out there.  Hey man, this is like a people's radio show.  And how dare you guys take it upon yourselves.  Yeah.  To, uh, just boot 10 girls just like that.  Mm-hmm.  Well today, Anthony.  Yeah.  We're going to spread it out a little bit. 
[00:06:00]  Spread out some of the responsibility for, uh, booting off some of the girls.  A little bit.  Mm-hmm.  So today on the show, you, myself, Ben, Rick, Stinky, and we'll give Steve from foundrymusic.com.  Of course.  All of us will get to kick out one girl.  One girl.  One girl each.  Now, will there be any veto power or anything?  This is it.  If you pick a girl, she is gone from the contest.  Gone from the contest. 
[00:06:30]  No veto power.  Wow.  So if somebody wants to be a dick.  Well, I'm hoping.  I'm hoping no one wants to be a dick and throws a hot chick out.  No, no, no.  Well, yeah, come on.  No.  You, you gotta, uh, what?  Oh, Rick.  Rick's got a personal vendetta.  Rick already picked his.  Oh my God.  All right.  We'll announce that a little later.  Yep.  Because we're going to start with Stinky.  Get Stinky in here.  Ah, Stink-a.  Before the show gets, uh, you know, moving.  Yeah.  You know, he's got to answer the phones and stuff.  He'll be the first guy to pick a girl. 
[00:07:00]  He's a very busy man.  To get kicked out of the, uh, the wow contest.  I don't even know if Stinky knows that he has to.  Huh?  He's like, right now.  He's the last.  What?  I don't have time to look.  Oh, you gotta look through the, uh, girls?  Well, look now.  Do we have John or somebody that we can throw on the phones for a few minutes?  Uh, yeah.  Mary's here.  Oh, yeah.  Throw Mary on the phone.  Stinky, take your time.  There's a very serious vote you got.  Oh, we're not going right now.  Huh?  Just throughout the show.  Well, we're starting with you.  So, you have to figure it out within the next 10 or 15 minutes. 
[00:07:30]  Okay.  All right.  And then when you're done, then we'll move to Ben.  And then Steve.  Then Rick.  I'm looking him over very quickly.  And then the first one that really catches my eye, like, oh, why the hell is she in here?  Ow.  All right.  But, you know, that's how I'm going to do it.  Okay.  I'm not really going to study much.  I'm just going to, you know.  Are you going to just start from the top?  Yeah.  And the first, um, mess you see, you're just going to boot?  No, I'm going to go through them all.  And then the one that just hit me the most where I go, oh, why the hell is she in here?  Ben, what?  I'm ready to go.  Ben's ready to go. 
[00:08:00]  Ben's ready already.  Rick's ready to go.  Someone better tell Steve that he gets to kick a girl out of the contest today as well.  Okay.  I know who I want to kick out.  I know who I'm kicking out.  Let me see.  Let me see.  Better not be mine.  Oh, yeah.  We should have taken care of that problem yesterday.  That should have been taken care of yesterday.  I think we might have hinted toward it so people that were listening yesterday probably know who I'm kicking out.  Yeah.  All right.  So, uh, Stinky has to figure one out.  I have to figure one out. 
[00:08:30]  And Steve has to figure one out.  Do you have an inkling?  I got to look at the pictures again real fast.  You don't have an inkling?  Well, I think you picked mine.  Did I?  I know who I want to pick.  I'll just make a sign to you.  I hope it's not, uh...  Oh, really?  Yeah.  God, I don't know what number she is, but I know exactly who you're talking about.  And there's going to be some controversy because the boobs are very nice.  Are they?  Really?  Well, yeah, but, uh...  What about this one?  Is anybody going to pick her? 
[00:09:00]  I was thinking her as well.  You were thinking her?  Yeah.  A little too manly.  Really?  Yes.  All right, so as soon as Stinky figures out who he's going to kick out, he'll come into  the studio and announce it, okay?  And I'm going to give this other opportunity, Anthony.  Oh, oh, oh, yes, yes.  I am going to give the girls that are in the WOW Contest an opportunity to perform, uh, uh,  what is it called, that Harry, that, uh, uh, uh, uh, with the...  Harry Carrey.  Yeah.  To perform Harry Carrey. 
[00:09:30]  Hi!  Harry Carrey on themselves.  Perform Harry Carrey.  I want at least one girl that qualified for the WOW Contest to call up and admit that  she's not going to be, uh, part of the top 20 finalists.  And drop out.  And drop out.  I want someone to drop out on their own.  Oh.  To have the balls.  They've been sitting at their computer.  They've seen the rest of the competition.  And I want someone out there to be honest with themselves and call up and go, you know  what?  I'm not going to make the top 20, uh, finals. 
[00:10:00]  I am, uh, kicking myself out of the contest.  That's, that's the one I'm going to.  I thought so.  But see, wait, wait.  Go like this though with your hands?  Yeah.  All right?  And bottom too.  Yeah.  See, that wouldn't be that bad.  You know what I mean?  But the rest of it, that's why there's going to be some controversy.  That's a tricky move there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You ready?  All right.  Hold on.  So, so I am looking for a few girls that are, are willing to admit that they, they just didn't  cut the mustard and I want them to kick themselves out of the contest today.  And finally, Anthony. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  We're going to give one lucky listener, one lucky listener, but you have to be in front  of your computer so you can give us numbers and everything.  We really want you to work on this a little bit.  And this is where Ant and I will be able to veto.  Oh, we will have veto power.  Yes, because I know that our listeners could be a-holes.  Right.  And I know if we pick a guy, he could be a goofball and go, I'm going to, you know,  I'm going to kick out Parker.  But only if he's, like, kicking out a really hot girl.  We just get a chance to veto.  If there's one on the wire, we've got to take his word for it. 
[00:11:00]  Yeah, we'll take that under consideration.  You know what I mean?  All right.  I mean, but we'll be able to tell if the guy's just being a dick.  Right.  All right?  Oh, my God.  I'm so excited to hear everybody's picks.  I know.  So, Stinky, you're ready?  All ready.  Stinky, you are ready.  I went right to the last group of pictures.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Oh, my God.  In the last group?  The last, the 90 to 100 area.  Oh, the 90 to 100.  Oh, 90 to 100.  Okay.  Let me get in there.  Everyone throw their computers at home.  Wow.  They just added more girls to the contest since we started talking. 
[00:11:30]  All right.  90 to 100.  Wait.  Go up.  Okay.  Let me see.  All right.  I'm going to guess who it is.  Okay.  I'm going to guess.  Let me look.  It's between 90 and 100.  It's so obvious.  It's so goddamn obvious.  All right.  Go ahead, Stinky.  Who are you kicking out of the wow contest?  Number 98.  I knew it.  Oh, I picked another one.  No way.  Who else are you picking on this page?  Well, I don't. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I see what you mean.  I didn't see her.  Contestant 98.  Hold on.  Angie from the Big Wazoo in Columbus.  You're out.  Out.  Stinky kicked you out of the contest.  Stinky booted you.  Out.  Her picture ended up on my desktop.  Yeah.  I might have voted her out.  All right.  Write that down so Columbo could cross her out.  Yeah.  Who's up next? 
[00:12:30]  I think it's to Ben.  Ben, we'll get your pick after the commercials.  You hear the music out there?  Yeah.  AC Dixie.  That's great.  With Barley Scotch.  That's right.  Yeah.  Oh, and Anthony, breaking news.  Breaking news.  It's still a developing story.  Yeah.  We wanted to have Tippi Tom in today.  Yeah, because didn't we have a surprise for him?  We have a huge surprise for Tippi Tom.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:13:00]  You know, it's the return of Tippi Tom.  We're getting reports that Tippi Tom might have lost his leg.  What?  Ben, grab a mic.  Like, because I know.  Word on the street is that Tippi Tom.  Word on the street.  That Tippi Tom, he fell down some subway stairs.  Yeah.  Injured himself.  I think he even talked about that when he was on the show.  Uh-huh.  I guess he didn't take care of the injury.  Oh, no.  And his leg is literally hanging on his body. 
[00:13:30]  It's a guy like gangrene.  And there's a rumor that he is in the hospital because he might be losing his leg.  Well, it's also that, first of all, I guess he got his ass kicked.  Because remember the WOW shirt and hat we gave him?  I saw a different guy wearing his clothes with his cart a couple weeks ago.  And there's a report that all his stuff is splattered around a park where he hangs out.  And the last thing that I heard is that he never, yeah, he never, you know, took care of his leg.  And it was like literally like hanging or something like that.  You know what we do on this show?  We take these people, we wrap them in raw meat, and shove them into the lion cage. 
[00:14:00]  It's the same thing.  We give them new shirts and hats and stuff.  We always, yeah.  They go out and next thing we know, some big black guys walking around wearing it.  And Tippi Tom's beat up.  Hey, some of the white homeless guys can fight too, Anthony.  Survival of the fittest and Tippi Tom losing the battle.  Losing the battle.  So, Keith, the cop, is trying to hunt him down.  He's checking all the area hospitals.  And if he finds Tippi Tom in good shape, he will bring him to the station today. 
[00:14:30]  You don't die of AIDS.  Die of your leg falling off.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old.  Really, Tom?  Now, you don't like queers?  Is that what you're saying?  I just don't like guys with one leg.  His poor leg is rotting off.  So, it's a rumor right now.  Keith, the cop, I'm sure, will be calling the show to give us an update, okay?  A homeless guy's gangrenous leg, what that must smell like? 
[00:15:00]  I know.  But he was supposed to be the showstopper today, Anthony.  Wasn't there an event that was supposed to take place for him?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Now, wait a minute.  I know.  I don't want to give out too much.  I know, but if he's not here...  It makes us look pretty bad.  Yeah, because it was for him.  I know.  It was for him.  Now, you don't like queers?  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old.  And this was for him.  Him.  Yeah.  So, without him being... 
[00:15:30]  Well, we'll have to explain this to the surprise.  Let's just put it that way, okay?  It'll make for some...  You explain it to the surprise.  It'll make for some uncomfortable moments on the Opie and Anthony show today if this doesn't pan out, Anthony.  All right?  We'll eat Tippy Tom's leg for prizes here on this show.  So, come on now, right?  We can't waste.  Waste not want not.  I'll tell you one thing, though.  If Ben says that Tippy Tom's in bad shape, you've got to believe Ben.  Yeah.  Ben should be working for entertainment tonight at this point. 
[00:16:00]  Ben is the man on the street.  He is...  This guy knows everything about everything that's going on before the news gets it.  Like, I'm reading Fox News Entertainment this morning.  It was all stuff I was told through numerous cell phone calls last night from our own Ben.  I went to Frenchie's restaurant.  Sous-moi.  Sous-moi.  He taught me how to say suck it in French.  Suck it.  Sous-moi.  Pouf-yase.  We're saying suck it, whore. 
[00:16:30]  Walking down the street.  We're all walking down the street, and he's laughing his ass off because we're not talking  French, and we realize why it's so funny when he says suck it with the accent because  he's laughing.  We're just walking down.  Girls are walking by.  Sous-moi.  Sous-moi.  Pouf-yase.  It's the funniest guy I've ever seen.  Suck it, whore.  Suck it, whore.  But as we're eating, we get numerous phone calls from Ben.  So you were getting the calls, too, huh?  Ben loves calling people.  I was so happy to be receiving these calls. 
[00:17:00]  Usually it's just a drunken Ben that's not at all.  Babbling.  This was good stuff.  He was doing his laundry.  Oh, for sure.  Ben is doing his laundry in his building.  But lo and behold, the laundry room window is facing one of the hottest clubs in New York  City that was having its one-year anniversary last night, and it was star-studded.  Star-studded.  So I'm getting updates from the laundry room.  Guys, I just saw Kevin Bacon. 
[00:17:30]  I was, no, I swear, I was putting in the fabric softener.  And Kevin Bacon walked by.  It was like an old Hollywood report.  You know where they used to do the, by the side of the red carpet, and the stars would  come rolling up?  And that's what I was getting from him.  Guys, I'm doing my laundry here, and it's a star-studded event.  I'm putting detergent in my pants as the crowd pants at the lovely Gina Gershon. 
[00:18:00]  I'm walking down the carpet.  Guys, another phone call here.  I'm putting Nicholson in the washing machine as Nicholson is walking into the club.  Wonderful day, star-studded.  Limos racing by the club as my racing stripes are being washed from my underwear. 
[00:18:30]  The rappers pulling up in their SUV, leaving skid marks on by the curb as I try to shout out  these skid marks in my skimmies.  Just a star-studded event.  There go the pens.  And I hope I can get this exploded pen stain out of my shirt pocket. 
[00:19:00]  It was.  It was like every ten minutes or so, the phone rang.  You know why Ben is the man, though?  He went from doing laundry in probably his laundry clothes...  Right.  ...to running home, shaving, showering, and getting into the party.  Of course.  The guy could talk his way into anywhere.  He's like...  He goes, yeah, I walked in, and then I realized I knew some people from...  The guy knows everybody.  So he walks up to the door.  The guy's like, yeah, give me like 10, 15, 20 minutes. 
[00:19:30]  And he goes, okay, no, I've got to shave and put on some new clothes.  And he runs up.  He's like Celebrity Superman.  Mild-mannered Ben doing his laundry.  And then he turns into Celebrity Man.  And he's telling us all this stuff, and then we go on the website, and an hour later, they finally are reporting all the stars that were at this event.  On Fox News, they got all the, yeah, all the stars that are there.  He's telling me, yeah, Nicholson walks by, gets a bottle of Jack, and just sits at the table.  There's babes, him, Adam Sandler.  Well, the best was, I came out of my building, and I was going over, and who just comes walking down the street, no security, nothing. 
[00:20:00]  But Nicholson and Sandler walking together.  Nicholson was like, oh, I was like, Jack, let's go.  Nicholson and Sandler up.  Say, hey, man, how are ya?  And the guy I knew that was taking care of me was like, dude, one second, I've got to take care of Jack first.  Got to take care of Jack first.  Nicholson, Sandler.  And Ben said that everyone was saying, yeah, I'm going to go hang out with Jack.  Yeah, all these idiots I know from Boston that I know from college.  Dude, I'm going to go hang out.  Shut up.  You're not hanging with Jack. 
[00:20:30]  No one just hangs with Jack.  Who else was there?  There was Spike Jones.  I saw Gina Gershon, who was really, that's how this whole thing got started.  I was grabbing a slice of pizza while down the street.  I'm like, who's this hot chick right in front of me?  And she was just walking down the street going to the party.  When I get Gershon on my pants, I have to wash it off.  I use bleach.  She's gorgeous.  Her skin looks as soft as my T-shirt after I use some Downey.  Ben's the laundry entertainment reporter. 
[00:21:00]  Michael Myers.  Mike Myers got the biggest, the crowd went crazy.  Did he?  Yeah, he did.  He was, he's good, like, you know, for the reporters and stuff, doing his little dances  and stuff.  Here comes Mike Myers, Austin Powers, as time powers out the stains in my underwear.  I'll be calling you in ten minutes with another update.  This is Ben.  Frenchy's on the phone. 
[00:21:30]  Hey, Frenchy.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Frenchy.  You're a salope.  You whore bag.  You're a salope.  Stupid guy last night was coming down on the street to all the girls that were passing by.  I was yelling, suck it, whore.  Yes, suck it, you bitch.  Exactly.  And then he taught us how to say, uh, what's the other thing?  Just say it in French.  Uh, what's it?  No, uh, poufias.  No, they eat.  Uh, mange moi, salope.  They mean, eat me, you whore. 
[00:22:00]  Stupid guy who was screaming that to everybody last night.  But you say it in French, and the girls look again, smile and nod.  Yeah, exactly.  Because you're saying it in French, so they must think it means something good.  Suck it, whore.  I was almost running on the avenue.  I almost got hit by a car.  Now, Frenchy, you got some calls from Ben.  He called me three times last night.  Yeah, I saw Kevin Beacon.  He said, okay, whatever, I gotta work.  He gets excited.  He wants to share the news with everyone.  I was by myself.  There's nothing else to tell.  He told me at least four times. 
[00:22:30]  Frenchy, three times.  Anthony, at least four times.  And Anthony was in the restaurant, too.  He was right next to me.  All right, hold on, Frenchy.  All right.  As Kevin Beacon walks in, I'm reminded, some bacon grease splattered all over my brand new pants.  But I'll get it out.  And then change, it'll be the life of the party.  Just let me shave and change my sneakers, and I'll be right back.  It was too much last night, I'll tell you right now.  You know who else I saw that I don't think has any recollection that he was ever here was Stephen Baldwin. 
[00:23:00]  Stephen Baldwin?  Yeah, wasn't he?  Yeah, he was here.  Yeah, he was there.  He's out of his mind.  Is he just tanked?  I don't know what he was.  He didn't make any sense.  I don't know.  Stephen Baldwin.  All right.  Hey, Frenchy, thank you.  Hey, no problem.  Take it easy, guys.  And sous-moi, poufias.  All right.  Hey, Frenchy, you showed a lot of range today.  Very good.  All right.  There it is.  You don't want to be a one-trick pony on this show.  All right.  We got a Tippy Tom update, but we got to take a break.  Keith the Cop is on the line. 
[00:23:30]  We'll get the Tippy Tom update.  We got Hasey Dixie.  They're ready to go outside the studio.  They're our house band today.  Angie, who was just kicked out of the WOW contest.  Mm-hmm.  She's on the line and very pissed off.  Oh, Jesus.  We'll talk to her next as well and get Ben's pick of who should be kicked out of the WOW contest.  I can't wait for that one.  All next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Ball.  Ball.  Come on.  Ball.  Ball.  Come on.  Ball. 
[00:24:00]  Ball.  Ball.  That's too heavy.  He's giving you the blues.  You want to graduate, but not his big.  That's what you got to do.  Pick up the phone.  I'm always home.  Call me anytime.  Just three, four, three, six, three, two, hey.  I live a life of crime.  Say a dirty deed, a done dirt cheap.  Dirty deed, a done dirt cheap.  Dirty deed, a done dirt cheap. 
[00:24:30]  Dirty deed and a done dirt cheap.  Dirty deed and a done dirt cheap.  You got problems in your life of love.  You got a broken heart.  She's never dealing with your best friend.  That's when the tear grabs start.  Pick up the phone, leave her alone.  I'll make a social call.  Come right in, we'll keep out here.  We'll have a special ball.  Say a dirty deed, a done dirt cheap. 
[00:25:00]  Dirty deed, a done dirt cheap.  Dirty deed, a done dirt cheap.  Dirty deed and a done dirt cheap.  Dirty deed and a done dirt cheap.  B-Hall.  Hello.  Hello.  You got a lady and you won't hurt y'all. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, but you ain't got the guts.  She keeps you nagging at your night and day.  Enough to drive your nuts.  Pick up the phone, leave her alone.  Before I said, boy, it's time you made a stand.  For a fee, I'm happy to be.  You're a back door man.  Dirty deed, a done dirt cheap. 
[00:26:00]  Dirty deed, a done dirt cheap.  Dirty deed, a done dirt cheap.  Dirty deed and a done dirt cheap.  Dirty deed and a done dirt cheap.  And we're back with the Ovi and Anthony show. 
[00:26:30]  We got a house band today.  That's live, man.  Hey, C. Dixie with Barley Scotch, Anthony.  We love these guys.  They're going to be playing all day long for us today, okay?  That is great.  We've heard the CD, but that is live.  And, man, pretty cool, right?  God damn.  Yeah, we'll get them in in a few minutes here.  They got a couple albums.  Their old album, which we really, really dug a lot,  Hillbilly Tribute to ACDC is available. 
[00:27:00]  And their new album, Hillbilly Tribute to Mountain Love.  I wonder if they got that CD.  Well, they'll probably play some of that, right?  Okay, cool.  And they're performing tonight at the Bottom Line  and tomorrow night at the Black Potato Festival in Clinton, New Jersey.  Hayseed Dixie with Barley Scotch, the house band today on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hanging out with us today.  Very nice.  Okay, we got lots to get to, Anthony.  Angie's on the phone.  Yeah, I had just popped her picture up now.  She's one of the WOW contestants, number 98, I believe. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  And, well, we figured today, since yesterday we kicked ten girls off ourselves,  me and O.P. just took it upon ourselves to get rid of ten girls  we didn't feel were really cutting the mustard.  And the listeners felt like we were showing a little too much power yesterday.  So now today we figured we're going to spread it out a bit.  Right.  Me and you, we'll pick a girl each to be thrown off.  Right.  So will Rick, so will Ben, so will Steve C.  And Jim Norton, if he ever gets here. 
[00:28:00]  And Norton, if he gets here.  The first guy that got to choose today and starts this controversy now because Angie's  on the phone number 98 is our own Stinky.  Awesome Garrett awesomely threw her out of the contest.  And now she's pissed.  And she wants to talk to us.  This is never good when the girls call in to talk to us about this.  Never good, Angie.  Angie.  Hey, guys.  Wow.  Yeah, wow.  Well, you sound like a fun gal.  Hey, you know what?  I was just going to call in and dignify myself with Harry Carey. 
[00:28:30]  And then Stinky goes and pulls me off.  Oh, you were going to commit suicide?  Yes, I was.  Oh, explain that, Anthony.  Any girl that now is looking through the pages upon pages of hot chicks that are in this contest  now that feels, well, you know something, I don't think I'm worthy to be in this.  And I might be, there might be a threat that I'll be thrown off by the guys to save the  dignity of herself.  She can throw herself on that knife.  Harry Carey.  Harry Carey style and commit contest suicide and leave the contest itself. 
[00:29:00]  And Angie, you were going to do the Harry Carey thing, but we beat you to it, huh?  Yes.  So let Stinky pick another girl.  Girl.  And let me dignify my marriage by kicking myself off.  You know, sometimes it just happens that way.  It's a close call.  Angie's got a good personality.  I want her in the contest now.  Of course she does.  Look at that body.  Stop.  You know what?  That's the reason my husband married me, because I had a good personality. 
[00:29:30]  Hey.  God damn.  I feel like we're all going to talk like we're from the South because of Hasty Nixie.  That's good.  That's good.  That's good.  Lordy Lord.  Hey, your left boob is so much bigger than your right.  You know what?  I just got to state the obvious here, Angie.  I know.  I know.  And you know what?  Maybe you could give me a breast augmentation or something.  You know?  Maybe liposuction.  Hey, that'd be good, too. 
[00:30:00]  I'm up for that one, too.  Yeah.  You know what?  In that second shot where you're holding yourself in your hands, it really...  You could have propped that other one up a little and pulled your hand down.  The left one was a little too heavy to lift it all the way up there, Ant.  Where do you get your bras?  Are they custom made?  No, Walmart, man.  I'm a Walmart shopper.  Oh, you certainly are.  Listen to you.  Hi, welcome to Walmart.  You know what?  Well, I got one boob.  It's bigger than the other. 
[00:30:30]  And I need a special Walmart bra.  Hey, hey, listen.  Yeah.  This has been the best fun I have ever done.  Oh, cool, Angie.  And if it weren't for the guys at work daring me to do this, I would have never done it.  I guess there's not much going on in Columbus, huh?  No, not really.  And if I didn't do it, I would have to give out my balloon knot.  What?  Ugh.  Who wants to see that?  That's great.  Hey, send me some T-shirts.  Can you do that?  You know something?  I think we could do it.  You're way too cool, so we're going to send you some stuff, okay? 
[00:31:00]  Hey, that'd be great.  Stinky, we don't need you to abuse her.  We had Stinky already.  Good job.  Yeah.  Angie, you're all right.  Hold on to the line, okay?  I was poised for attack.  All right, boys.  Have fun.  And she was going to do the Harry Caray thing.  There's got to be one girl out there that is willing to do the Harry Caray thing.  What a cool, lopsided, boob chick she was.  She was all right.  We had the song queued up.  Yeah.  Queued up and everything.  You aren't worthy to be in the contest.  Man, you are one pathetic loser. 
[00:31:30]  Save it, then she turned out to be cool.  You're the ugliest stripper I've ever seen in my life.  Now you get the hell out of here.  Angie, you're a filthy whore.  Hey, buddy, get out of my way.  Until those clouds don't disappear.  Angie.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Angie, this was for you. 
[00:32:00]  Angie.  Yeah?  We have the song and everything for you.  You know what?  I love you guys.  You guys are awesome.  You were supposed to be a bitch like that girl yesterday.  Yeah.  I know.  But you know what?  I got to tell you something.  Yeah.  At least I have straight teeth.  I might have crickle boobs, but I got straight teeth.  Hallelujah.  You took one of those headless pictures, though. 
[00:32:30]  You should have taken it from the neck up.  I didn't want nobody to see who I was.  I guess not.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  But we're going to get through this.  We're going to turn this thing around.  We're going to turn this thing around. 
[00:33:00]  Get me a boob on my teeth.  Nice girl, but about as sharp as a sack of wet mish. 
[00:33:30]  I got to pee.  Hurry.  Torture.  It's torture.  Yeah, we had all this set for you.  It's not important.  Angie, all right, man.  Yeah, you did all right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Good luck to you.  Hold on a line.  We're going to give you some stuff, okay?  Okay.  You guys have a good day.  All right.  You too, Angie.  All right.  Bye.  Call back sometime.  You're fun.  All right.  I will.  I will.  I will. 
[00:34:00]  There she goes.  Oh, I need a drink.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.  It's not so much that I want to kill her. 
[00:34:30]  It's just I want her not to be alive anymore.  You got knocked the f*** out of it.  Hang the phone up, you skank.  If you can't say we're satisfied.  It's going to make you puke.  I still love you, baby. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, well, when I look, I see your eyes.  That's a good tune.  I love this song.  Yeah.  Too bad she was a trooper.  It's not fun when they play along.  Well, there's plenty of other girls to throw out.  No, actually, that was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Okay.  Who's up?  Ben is up next.  Right.  Ben gets to choose which girl he wants thrown out. 
[00:35:30]  And a lucky listener is going to get to choose a girl, too.  Also, we need Keith the cop to call.  He was on the line as we went to break.  We can't tease him through another freaking commercial break.  Tippy Tom update.  Yeah, Tippy Tom was supposed to stop by today, the return of Tippy Tom.  Yeah.  We had a big surprise for him.  Would have made him happy.  And we're going to look completely ridiculous.  Because it's a surprise just for him.  Not for us, for Tippy Tom.  Just for you.  And we're hearing things.  We're hearing that Tippy Tom might be in a hospital because his leg is hanging off his body. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, something happened.  He fell down some stairs.  It got infected.  I don't know.  So, Keith the cop is searching for Tippy Tom right now.  Yeah.  And he's checking all the hospitals.  He was on the phone, but he hung up because we went to break.  So, hopefully, we'll call back in a minute or two.  I guess in the meantime, we could get Ben's pick.  Because Ben's ready.  Ben's ready.  Ben's ready to rock.  Also, let's not forget, one lucky listener will be able to kick off a girl from the WOW contest today.  Yeah.  And we're looking for the first girl to call up and commit Harry Carey today. 
[00:36:30]  It was close with Angie.  She said she was calling up to throw herself on that knife and get out of the contest with a little dignity.  There's got to be at least one girl out there willing to admit that she's not going to make the top 20.  Yeah.  That, you know, you're at home and you're counting to yourself on the computer.  Like, oh, she's hotter than me.  She's hotter.  She's hotter.  Oh, my God.  I'm up to 50 girls that are hotter than me.  I better call the guys and commit Harry Carey.  Yeah.  I'd have a lot of respect for that girl if she did that today.  Whoa.  So, Ben?  Yes. 
[00:37:00]  Who's the next to go?  That would be number...  Oh, no!  Well, I have to do it because this caused such a controversy with Earl.  Number 23, the girl that Earl's head ended up on, Jay.  And, you know, she caused a controversy around the office here.  And for my good pal Earl's sake, that's why I'm throwing her out.  You're throwing out Jay, the big boob black chick?  Yeah.  You know, it's just because I can always...  I have to vision with Earl's head on her from now on.  And I just saw that everywhere. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, boy.  Sorry, you know.  Wow.  She's got big, lovely boobies there.  Well, they're big.  Those are some giant cans.  All right.  And she looks like the girl from real world London.  Yeah.  The black chick that was in real world London.  So, she's out.  Out.  What's her name?  Jay.  Oh, Jay.  I'm sorry.  Contestant number 23.  That's what I meant to say.  Contestant number 23.  All right.  So, she is now out of the contest.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:38:00]  I'll probably get shot now.  Why?  Oh, I'm looking at...  All right.  Up next is Steve from foundrymusic.com.  I'm just looking at a contestant that might be just but a blink on the WOW Contest screen.  What do you mean?  What are you talking about?  Oh, yeah.  That's very new.  That's new, huh?  It could be an in and out.  She might have to have the life of a Titi fly.  One of those little mayflies where they just are born and later that day. 
[00:38:30]  Steve, you're ready to pick?  Ooh.  Oh, no.  No.  No.  That's the one I wanted to throw out.  All right.  Well, wait.  I got to back up.  Dang.  Wait.  Are we going right for your pick now?  You don't have to.  No.  We got to spread this out a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  Okay, good.  You picked a good one.  He didn't pick mine, huh?  He didn't pick mine, did he?  Uh, no.  Good.  No, no, no, no.  You want to see mine? 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Over here?  Here.  Here we go.  Hey, Ben, can you call Keith?  This one.  I'm just stalling.  So goddamn gone.  We just did, and I think they said he's downstairs and could be on his way up.  With Tippi Tom?  Could be.  That's what we're waiting for in the next few minutes.  Oh, wow.  I hope so.  Now we can tease that, Anthony.  I hope he's with the...  We'll keep the copy showing up with Tippi Tom.  Because I sure don't want to have to look at his surprise.  Stay tuned and find out.  Hey, is Hasey Dixie ready to play another song? 
[00:39:30]  They're just jamming out there.  Well, tell them we want to hear another one as we go to break here, okay?  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You guys ready to rock again?  Yeah.  Hallelujah.  All right.  Hallelujah.  I just want to remind the folks that you guys are performing tonight at the bottom line.  Hey, C. Dixie.  Check this out.  Hold on.  Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah.  But Garrett was singing for him.  Oh.  Hold on.  Oh, Lord.  Man, you didn't have your guy out here to wave that cue finger at us.  Sound engineer ain't even in here. 
[00:40:00]  We're trying to drink a little.  They're just sucking down beer after beer.  I busted apart those stereotypes.  They're getting hammered.  Well, yeah.  Here's Hasey Dixie.  W.  Two, three, four.  Oh, you're going to take me home tonight.  Oh, down the side of that red fire light.  Oh, you're going to let it all hang out.  Fat bottom girls, you make the rockin' world go round. 
[00:40:30]  I was just a skinny lad.  Never knew no good to bad.  But I knew love before I left my nursery.  Left them over, pick that penny.  She was such a naughty nanny.  Big woman, you made a bad boy out of me.  Oh, you're going to take me home tonight.  Oh, down the side of that red fire light.  Oh, you're going to let it all hang out. 
[00:41:00]  Fat bottom girls, you make the rockin' world go round.  Yeah, fat bottom girls, you make the rockin' world go round.  And we're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We've got a house band today, Hasey Dixie, with Barley Scotch.  They're playing tonight at the bottom line, Anthony.  We're going to get them in here in a few minutes, but we've got a lot of things going on today.  We have at least 13 to 15 people outside the studio, Anthony.  It's turning into a party.  A little party going on. 
[00:41:30]  I do believe we have enough people for a rally, matter of fact.  Really?  Yeah, these days you only need 13 to 15 people for a rally, so what the hell?  Let's have a rally today, Anthony.  All right, great.  We're officially having the O&A rally.  Ah, God damn, that's good.  Ah, that's rich.  We also have a very, very, very...  They're still playing.  Still pursuing home.  Yeah.  We also have a very hot girl outside the studio that's entering the WOW contest. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, there's something going on.  Like, I looked outside, and I see this girl walking up.  She's got, like, a couple of guys with her, and, like, a portfolio thing.  I'm like, what is she doing here?  And I go, it can't possibly be for the WOW contest.  She doesn't even know what the WOW contest is yet.  Really?  Yeah, so this could be a problem.  Maybe we should tell her live on the air.  Yeah, let's do that.  I think the word has finally gotten out that we're having a WOW contest, because the quality  is getting better and better.  Now they're stepping up. 
[00:42:30]  Hey, Christine, what's up?  What's up?  Real fast.  What do you got?  Well, I'm looking online here at a bunch of these ugly girls.  Yeah.  And I noticed you did the right thing by putting an X through a bunch of them.  But you said you're cutting it off at 100, and I was going to come down tomorrow to get  in it, and it looks like you already have 100 cows on there.  Oh, no.  Where are you from?  Philadelphia area.  Go down to WISP tomorrow.  They'll take your pictures.  Mm-hmm.  No, we've extended it a little bit.  We're getting rid of a lot of the messes to make room for more hot chicks. 
[00:43:00]  And there are quite a few messes.  Let me just tell you, you guys really at first had me completely paranoid to, you know, enter,  because you were just making it out like these girls are so hot and cute.  There's like maybe five girls that are good looking.  All right.  We'll take a look at you tomorrow, okay?  All right.  We can't wait.  Christine from Philly.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  So she's going to enter the contest tomorrow.  Right. 
[00:43:30]  Okay.  The stinky cam is on.  You can see the hot lady, the hot woman that is in our studio right now.  What's your name?  Nora.  Nora.  Yes.  And you are a model.  Yes.  I'm with Siren.com.  You are?  Not Wow.  I don't know what Wow is yet.  Oh, you don't?  No, I'm kind of scared.  That's something.  And what kind of modeling do you do?  Well, it's Playboy style.  It is.  So there's some nudity in there?  Yes.  You're comfortable with some nudity?  Some nudity. 
[00:44:00]  Oh.  Very erotic.  Yeah.  Not like, you know, I know the other magazines.  We get them in the back, like Swank or something like that.  Yeah, it's out in the bathroom.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a lot of Southern accents around here today.  Where are you from?  Hotlanta.  Hotlanta.  Hotlanta.  Hotlanta.  Yeah.  Well, the Wow Contest is a contest.  You want to show, what's your name again?  Nora.  Oh, yeah.  Nora.  Nora.  Why don't you show Nora some of the contestants in the Wow Contest?  Let me show you some contestants.  Don't be alarmed, but you can count the money that you will be winning in this contest. 
[00:44:30]  $5,000 up for grabs.  We're just looking for the best.  Wow is Whip Them Out Wednesday.  We came up with this great idea.  You put a wow on your car somewhere, like a bumper sticker or just write it in the dirt  on the back of the truck, and if a girl feels so inclined as she sees that wow, she will  flash the driver of the car.  So, it's turned into a big thing.  Now, it's a wow contest, so we're looking for girls to give us their best wow, which  is, you know, a boob shot, but with a little something extra, you know, like, you know, 
[00:45:00]  some of the girls are posing a little, some have less clothing on than others.  Let me punch up Parker for you.  Okay.  She's a good example of the, you know, a wow girl, something like that, cute girl from  Texas, K-Y-N-G in Texas, and yeah, that's kind of a nice wow.  Yeah, she's a good looking girl.  Yeah, now, would you be up to something like this?  Sure.  Would you, um, would you, um, maybe wow us in the studio here? 
[00:45:30]  Okay, well, I've got, I've got a mosquito bite, so I don't want to, you've got a mosquito  bite.  Oh, boy.  And, and where, let me just see the mosquito bite.  Okay.  See?  Oh, it's over there.  Yeah.  It's a little mosquito bite.  Oh, that's okay.  I'm embarrassed.  That's, that's nothing.  Some girls call that their boob.  Yeah.  And they've entered this contest.  Yeah.  Rick will, uh, make it so maybe your hand can be there.  Well, she's a model. 
[00:46:00]  She can figure it out.  You can figure that out.  I didn't even see the mosquito bite.  Do you do any, do you do any videos?  Uh, no.  No.  Oh, look at this.  She goes, um, no.  Not that I'm against it.  I think it's wonderful.  Ah, just give me three years.  Yeah, three years.  You want, so you're into, uh, just erotic modeling.  Yeah.  And that includes, uh, no, no, like, no toys involved and things like that.  No, nothing like that.  But, um, it's, like I said, it's a Playboy style, siren.com. 
[00:46:30]  How do you spell the siren.com?  S-I-R-E-N.  There you go.  There you go.  It's like the sirens calling you.  Woo.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, why don't you get your photos done with Rick?  Rick is a professional photographer at this point.  Oh, oh, a little wowage.  Don't be, don't be embarrassed by your mosquito bite.  Okay.  That's okay.  Can we get it on the Stinky Cam so we can share with the listeners?  Okay.  Hold on.  That's right there.  Ant does this, uh, hold on.  You got to direct it, Rick.  Ant will direct you here.  Okay.  Okay, you ready?  Yeah, let's, uh.  Are you ready to get wowed? 
[00:47:00]  Here we go.  Ready to get wowed.  Oh, wow.  See, that's why we call it wow.  Oh, wow.  I got tamal.  Yeah.  You got very nice tamal lines.  Thank you.  Yes.  Are you wowed yet?  That is, that is it.  All right.  That's exactly what we're looking for.  Now go get some pictures taken.  All right.  And you'll be in the wow contest representing New York City.  Rick, are you a little, uh, intimidated?  She's a model, so she's got professional photographers, uh, photographing her.  And here's Rick, who have probably taken, uh, hundreds upon hundreds, maybe thousands  of pictures of girls in this studio. 
[00:47:30]  Cool.  Uh, but.  Let's go, Rick.  Come on.  He works well.  She's eager to work with Rick.  She's eager.  She's a professional, not like, uh, some others that may have stopped by yesterday.  All right, Rick.  That Rick will be kicking out when his turn comes along, I'm sure.  Well, that's great.  And, uh, thank you.  Uh, who will she be representing?  Uh.  New York.  Jack Nicholson.  Yeah, baby.  Is it true you got his number last night?  No, I didn't get his number, but, um, I did.  You were at that party, right?  I was at the party.  I was hanging.  It was quite a combination.  It was him, um, Adam Sandler. 
[00:48:00]  They were all hanging out.  It was just, I never would have thought Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler would hang out.  I think they got some movie coming out.  But, um, they were all very nice.  Yeah?  Stephen Baldwin kind of got scared of me, I think.  No, Stephen Baldwin is a nut.  We've had him up here.  Did you understand one word Stephen Baldwin said?  Well, I was in the process of talking to him and he just ran off.  Oh, look at that.  The star-studded music.  He was scared of me, I think.  He was scared of you?  Yeah, definitely.  He is a little paranoid, I think.  Just because he has that Baldwin name. 
[00:48:30]  I think he's a little walked out.  You know something?  Just because he's got that Baldwin name, he thinks he's one of those real Baldwins.  Yeah.  Like Alec Baldwin.  But he's not.  Which one is real?  He's drunk Baldwin.  We've seen him in action in this studio.  Wacked out, Baldwin.  I didn't understand the word he said.  He's a cook, but he was afraid of you a little bit?  I think so.  I can see that.  A little intimidating.  Very pretty girl.  He was standing up in the corner like a little puppy doll.  So I went over to talk to him and I was like, hey, what's up?  And he was like, uh, uh, uh, you know?  Oh, no.  See?  He does that to everybody.  Okay.  Okay, cool.  Yeah, then you're fine. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, all right.  Did you get anybody's number maybe that could help you out or anything like that?  I met the photographer, Patrick, what is his last name?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I'm thinking like celebrity.  I'm so starstruck right now.  Really?  New York, I love it, though.  Yeah, isn't it great?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Well, Rick, let's get the photo shoot started.  You'll get wowed.  Yeah.  Watch out for those good old boys outside the studio.  Hey, I like that country music.  All right.  Oh, and they're going to love you. 
[00:49:30]  I'll be back.  All right.  Nora will be back.  Beautiful.  There she goes.  Did you get a good picture of her?  Bring a little sarong and a small little top thing.  That is very nice.  You got a good picture on the stinky cam?  Oh, is it good?  Oh, yeah.  Cool.  Oh, great.  Good.  You can do the awesome cam, the stinky cam, whatever the hell we're calling it these days.  And check out Nora from siren.com.  Right there you go.  Well, I'll have to check that out.  Okay.  Keith, the cop is in the studio.  We're going to get a Tippy Tom update.  Yeah.  Tippy Tom was supposed to be the showstopper today.  The return of Tippy Tom. 
[00:50:00]  We've been hearing things that his leg might be falling off his body.  He might be in a hospital.  We had a huge surprise.  Yeah.  Now, when the huge surprise meets the good old boys.  Oh, no.  Oh, I didn't even think about that.  We could have a problem today.  Oh, my God.  Maybe we should tell the good old boys that the surprise is for them.  Hey, we're the good old boys.  Bring this clown in here.  Here's the lead singer.  Pretty funny eating corn on a cob.  No F and T.  Mike, you are. 
[00:50:30]  Oh.  That's it.  Yeah.  We got Barley Scott, the lead singer of Hacy Dixie.  Hallelujah.  How you doing, man?  You guys are sounding great so far.  I'm here to bear witness.  I'm here to testify.  I'm here to lay it down.  Are you feeling what I'm laying down?  That's what I want to know, brother.  Let me tell you.  You are singing and fiddling.  Got this piece of paper laying in front of me.  They don't like that word with the T word on the radio.  That's all right.  You can say boobs.  Oh, okay.  Look at the boobs.  Look at the rack.  Look at the knocker.  Look at the jugs.  Nice.  Look at the whiskey jars.  And the harmonies sounding great with the band. 
[00:51:00]  Nice.  It's amazing.  Nice, right?  Look at them pancakes on the ends of them.  Yeah.  She's out.  She's out of the contest.  I'm digressing.  We like to call them moose noses.  Get me back to my base level here.  Hey, what are you thinking, Nora?  The hot piece of ass from Atlanta.  Oh, you can say ass, but you can't say what I just said before?  Yeah.  You can say ass.  That's just like the South.  See, my granddaddy made moonshine.  He was also a Church of Christ preacher.  He saw no contradiction.  You got to keep your congregation happy.  You got to keep buying your product.  We might have a huge surprise for you guys in about an hour. 
[00:51:30]  Jesus, no.  Ah, Dan, we'll play about it.  We'll sing about it.  Oh, yeah?  It was supposed to be for this guy, Tippy Tom.  Yeah.  He's a homeless guy, roams around New York City, and apparently he was supposed to come in,  but apparently he had an accident, and his foot is gangrenous, and he's in a hospital where  they're pondering cutting it off, Keith?  Yeah, that's correct.  The last time he was here, I remember he was all banged up.  Yeah.  His face and everything.  He fell down the subway stairs, and he had stitches in his head and his leg, and he just 
[00:52:00]  continued to drink and not get it taken care of.  So I'm looking for him today, and I ran into one of my friends, and I said, you've seen Tippy  Tommy?  He goes, yeah, they're cutting his leg off over at the hospital.  I says, see, now they have-  Make sure they keep that.  Yeah, we've got pickled punk jar.  Put it in one of the pickled punk jars.  We could do something with his leg.  You're not trying to imply that the drinking wasn't good for the leg, were you?  Nah, nah.  See, I don't want to be a part of no show that in any way promotes the notion of any  kind of concept whatsoever that drinking ain't good for you. 
[00:52:30]  What are you kidding?  There's four things in this world worth singing about.  Drinking, cheating, killing, and going to hell.  And I do the first two on a regular basis.  I'm sure I'll get to the next.  I'm sure I'm definitely easing the pain.  Yeah, see?  It helped them out.  So there will not be an appearance by Tippy Tom today.  We'll have a call-in with Tippy Tom.  Oh, you got his hospital number?  Yeah, I went down, I saw him in the hospital, and-  How does he look?  Not like Tippy Tom.  Really?  He kind of looks like-  Did they clean him up?  He's very, uh-  Oh, no. 
[00:53:00]  Cleaned up.  Oh, they cleaned him up?  They're going to ruin our character.  I walked in there, and all I could think when I saw him was, wah, wah, wah, wah.  And I was like, oh, no.  You're ruining the bit.  You're saving the man's life, but you're ruining a bit.  So, and, you know, he'll tell me about the whole thing.  But he's cleaned up.  I stayed around.  I paid for his telephone.  I'll expense that.  Jeremy, thank you.  Hey, look at that.  Nice.  I guess the big surprise is going to be for the good old boys.  Now, see, Tippy Tom is supposed to get a surprise today, and Tippy Tom is a man whose sexuality 
[00:53:30]  is in flux, let's just say.  I don't know if we want to give away the surprise.  I'm not giving away any surprise.  I'm just saying that's the kind of guy he is.  I'm giving a little background on Tippy Tom because I don't know if they'd appreciate  the same types of things that maybe Tom would.  Well, that's all.  We're going to have to wait and see.  Same types of things in life?  I mean, anything.  A wine?  You know?  Movies?  Are you willing to accept the surprise that we had for Tippy Tom today? 
[00:54:00]  My body's a rock and roll temple.  Yeah.  So you're open for anything?  Well, not necessarily.  I'm open to the possibility of entertaining the option of anything.  All right.  If the deponent will, but I'm digressing.  Can you be a good sport today is what we're asking?  Depends on what you mean by sport.  Well, sport?  You'll have to wait and see.  Well, you know, I do have a gun.  You do?  On you?  Well, you know.  Oh, you guys do.  That's great.  We're from the South.  I love the South.  We're from the Appalachian Mountains.  With guns?  That's fantastic. 
[00:54:30]  In my opinion, if you can't kill a cow, process that cow, and make your own hamburger meat,  you have no right to eat a hamburger.  Moral indignation.  Hallelujah.  I like the way you think.  If you can't make your own whiskey, you have no right to walk into a bar and order a big, tall glass of whiskey.  Hey, cut us some slack there, okay?  I was with you with the burger thing, but I got a drink.  As long as you cut me some slack on this big surprise, man.  All right.  Well, you'll have to wait and see.  Could get a little weird in here today. 
[00:55:00]  Should we call up Tom, or when are we going to get...  Yeah, yeah, I have a phone number.  All right, give it a shot and see what happens.  Give the number to Ben Stinky.  And Barley, get ready to play us into commercials.  Right on.  With a little more from the latest album you're going to go with?  Let's go with his new album again.  Hillbilly Tribute to ACDC?  To Mountain Love.  Oh, Hillbilly Tribute to Mountain Love.  See, it was supposed to be Mountain Love as in Two Mount.  They told us the Walmarts wouldn't stock it, so we had to change the album.  Okay.  Goddamn Walmart.  We'll give you the cue.  It'll be a couple more minutes, because we're going to try to get Tippi Tom on the phone.  It's all right.  It's all right.  That's a heavy door. 
[00:55:30]  Someone could die today.  All right.  Anthony, one of our contestants is calling in, Sabrina.  Well, first, Matt from Angola, New York, she's so hot on the Stinky Cam.  Going back to Nora.  From Nora.  That he just, he couldn't even type right.  She, and then F word, and then hot.  He wrote, she F hot.  So I guess Matt likes her.  Yeah.  And that's not even the best picture of her. 
[00:56:00]  I captured it really quick.  But she's flashing.  Is she doing the shoot out there right now?  I don't know.  That's why I want to go.  Yeah, maybe we ought to go to break.  I want to go to break soon.  I want to go to break.  Yeah.  We need a break soon.  But first, we've got to talk to Sabrina.  Contestant number 29 in the WOW Contest.  Sabrina.  Hello.  Hi.  I'm waving the white flag, guys.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  The first girl that is committing Harry Caray in the contest.  Let me pop it up here.  Can you pop up 29 for me?  29. 
[00:56:30]  There it is.  Oh, that's you.  All right.  So, what?  You checked out the rest of the contestants?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't realize that much of my ugly face was going to be in there.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't know if instead you have an ugly face.  You've got a weird face in these pictures.  You are.  It seems like you are very grumpy in these pictures.  It looks like you're scared.  I would have scared to death.  You know what the third picture down looks like?  I'm looking at that now.  It looks like the picture the cops take after a domestic abuse case. 
[00:57:00]  A mug shot.  Yeah, where they take that picture of you and you show your bruises.  I'm going to say that you're hotter than these pictures.  Well, I like to think so.  For some reason, you went down to the big wazoo.  Boy, what a surprise.  And losing another contestant from Columbus.  Can I ask you something?  No offense, Columbus.  But you didn't give us a lot to work with here today.  How old a gal are you?  I'm 35.  See, you must have been a real goer back in your day, right? 
[00:57:30]  I guess you could say that.  Were you?  Yeah.  I say you have about four kids.  Three.  Wow, Opie, without even looking at a taint picture.  I just lost 30 pounds, though, guys.  I mean, in the last month.  You lost 30 pounds in the last month?  Uh-huh.  Wow, you must have really had some weight on you.  And you got some danglers on your boobs there.  Yeah, that was my birthday gift.  For what birthday?  The 35th.  Really?  Yeah.  Who gave you that? 
[00:58:00]  Me.  Did you get your piercings then, or did you have those before?  That's when I got my piercings.  Why did you decide to get pierced at that age?  You know what?  I'm not saying it's them.  I have no problem with the pierce.  I have no problem with the pierce.  Yeah.  I have a problem with the danglers.  I don't like the danglers from the boobs.  Go with hoops.  I don't like the barbells.  Or the barbells.  No, you know something?  I don't like the pierced nips.  I don't like it.  They deform them.  Oh, no, they don't. 
[00:58:30]  No, they stay.  That's what I mean.  They stay in the state of preparedness and happiness and whatever you want to call it.  But I think they destroy the nip area.  I don't like it.  Sometimes you like them to be soft.  I am.  No?  No.  Well, that's what we were trying to...  No, not at all.  Sabrina.  All right.  So you're going to wave the white flag.  Waving it off.  All right.  All right.  Well, thanks for being in our contest. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, no problem.  All right, Sabrina.  Contestant number 29.  Waving the white flag.  Committing Harry Carrey live on our show.  There she goes.  She is out of the wow contest.  Out!  Thank you, Sabrina.  All right.  There she goes, Sabrina.  Bye.  She's a trooper.  Remember those old war movies where the private would throw himself on the hand grenade to  save the rest of his squad?  She just did it.  We put a lot of girls in a weird situation today.  They're trying to call before we kick them out. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, they don't know which one we're talking about.  But you know something?  Deep down, I think they do know.  And maybe they want to get it over with.  I wonder if she was one of the girls that one of us was pondering throwing out.  I didn't even notice her, to be honest with you.  She did slip below the radar a little bit.  For some reason.  I believe she would have survived today.  She would have been in the contest after today, okay?  We're looking for more girls to commit Harry Carrey live on the show and kick themselves 
[01:00:00]  out of the wow contest.  I hope mine doesn't call up because I'm really psyched to get rid of her.  Also, Steve from FoundryMusic.com will have the next pick.  Yeah.  He's going to kick a girl out of the contest in a few minutes here.  But first, we've got to go live to the hospital.  Our buddy, our pal, Tippi Tom.  How are you doing, Tom?  Hi, how are you?  How are you feeling?  Oh, I'm feeling like a million bucks now.  I'm telling you, everything's just going fine. 
[01:00:30]  Now, can you please explain to me, which one am I talking to?  Opie and Anthony.  Opie?  Yeah, you're talking to both of us.  Oh.  You sound even gayer when you're sober.  So it's two against one here.  No, we're not ganging up on you.  Tippi Tom.  Wow, he does.  But, Tom, you've got to explain to us what happened to your foot.  Well, here's what happened.  About ten days ago, I was having a good time just strolling down 14th Street, right? 
[01:01:00]  He sounds so gay when he's sober.  And, you know, I was half-litter.  I was, you know, I was just being...  Yeah.  Just my normal thing.  Right.  But it was raining out.  So I wanted to get out of the rain.  And, you know, on 14th Street side or on 8th Avenue, they've got that fancy new slick  tile they're putting down that.  You know, they're spending $650 million to redo the subways.  I was reading about this.  Hey, Mario, can you give the phone to a tippy-tom? 
[01:01:30]  And the thing is this.  Yeah.  As I was coming downstairs, my foot slipped and I went overhead over heels.  Ass over tea kettle.  Yeah, halfway down the...  Yeah.  And I landed on my feet.  Thank goodness.  And...  But I...  The one foot must have caught the corner of the stairs.  This can't be seen, God.  And it ripped a good chunk.  Oh, it did.  Yeah.  So I had to get it fixed.  Yeah. 
[01:02:00]  And then the other foot just got bruised.  And, you know, and a few other bruises here and there.  So I had to spend a little time here.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I think I'm going to spend about another week and then I'm going to be ready to roll.  You think?  They're going to save your foot there, tippy-tom?  Hmm?  They're going to save the foot?  I'm going to...  But the foot again?  They're going to save it?  They're not...  You're not going to lose your foot, right?  Uh, no, no.  I was...  I thought at first I was going to get a wooden foot. 
[01:02:30]  And then I'm thinking, well, maybe I can live with that.  Is that a new position?  But no, no.  It looks pretty...  They said, no, you're not going to lose your foot.  Because I was, you know, I was panicking, you know, because it was pretty bad.  I hear they cleaned you up nice.  You got to shave and everything, huh?  I'm shaved up, bathed up.  I mean, I am...  Oh, my God.  I'm gorgeous.  It's just...  Oh, my God.  I'm serious, man.  I've never seen myself look so good.  Yeah.  And I'm going to try to stay this way. 
[01:03:00]  Are you?  Yeah.  Well, you are...  You don't even sound like Timmy.  You know something, Tom?  I'm sober now.  Yeah, we have had you up here in this studio a couple of times.  And you were...  You sounded different.  You were a little louder.  Mm-hmm.  You were a little more like you were having more of a good time.  I understand you're in the hospital now, so it's not like a party atmosphere or anything.  But there's just something about the timbre of your voice.  Yeah.  Something about the tone that's a little different when you were up here as opposed to the way you sound now. 
[01:03:30]  It's a bit gayer.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, it's kind of like recovering from, you know, a battle zone, a war.  You know, you're not quite there yet.  You know, it's going to take me a while to recover.  Yeah.  But when I recover, I'd love to come back on the show.  Hey, we know you love singing, Timmy, Tom.  Can you sing, um, Do You Think I'm Sexy?  Well, okay.  Well, hey, come on, baby. 
[01:04:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  No, no, no, no.  I don't know if I can get it out here.  If you want my body.  I'm too sexy for myself.  Yeah.  I...  I...  Give me the right town hall up here.  Let me see if I can get it going here.  Oh, my God.  Let me see.  Let me stretch out the broken knee here.  Okay.  Well, you want to hear Do You Think I'm Sexy?  Yeah.  Yeah, go ahead.  Which one?  Version by, uh, Timmy Tom or Rod Stewart?  Uh, the Rod Stewart version.  I just...  Okay.  Hold on. 
[01:04:30]  This is going to be rough.  All right.  Oh, you caught me off guard here.  That's all right.  Yeah.  Oh, everything.  Yeah.  You want to...  Something like that?  Yeah, right.  She walks along looking for attention.  Is that right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you think I'm sexy?  Come on, baby, baby. 
[01:05:00]  Come on, let me let me know.  If you really need me, come on, baby, please.  Come on, let me help.  It's the best I can do for now.  All right.  We're going to the hospital, you know what I'm saying?  Right.  As soon as I get my head together and I get behind that microphone and I get my voice back.  I get the microphone.  Yeah.  I got you.  Do you remember being up here, Tom?  I sure as heck do.  You do?  I was up there with rock and roll Tommy. 
[01:05:30]  No, no.  Do you remember the last time you were up here?  You were smashed.  You were up here with just us and Keith.  Do you remember that at all?  Do you want me to maybe...  I'll play a couple of...  Have him say it first from the hospital.  Oh, okay.  I have clips of you here, Tom.  Okay.  Taped clips of you saying certain things.  Up in the studio last time you were here and you were tying one on pretty good.  We were all drinking a little bit.  And we want to hear the contrast.  We want to hear the sober Tom and we want to compare it to the tippy Tom. 
[01:06:00]  Well, the first thing you say is, I'm a faggot and I've been a faggot since...  Since...  I've been a faggot and I've been a faggot and I've been a faggot since two years old.  All right.  Well, shout it out.  Well, that is true.  Yeah, but you know, we want to hear, before we play the tape of it...  Yeah.  ...you say, I'm a faggot, I've been a faggot since two years old.  Well, okay.  We want to hear you yell that out now and then we'll play the tape and see the difference  in sound. 
[01:06:30]  Well, I...  Okay.  You're serious.  Yeah.  I knew that I was a queer or a faggot or whatever you want to call it.  But, Tom, just...  I was two years old.  Tom, just say, I'm a faggot, I've been a faggot since two years old.  I've been a faggot ever since I was two years old and I knew it right from the start.  All right.  So, that's tippy Tom sober.  This is how he said it, really wasted in our studio.  Now, Tom, this is how you sounded.  Listen.  I'm a faggot, I was a faggot from two years old. 
[01:07:00]  See, that's...  See, you're a little louder.  Well, I don't have much.  See, I'm kind of like...  Give him a couple...  On the medication now, so...  Yeah.  Give him a couple of the other ones, Anthony.  All right, Tom, you were giving us a little knowledge about HIV and AIDS.  And you were telling us how you don't die of AIDS, you die of a disease that you get because  of the AIDS.  Now, from what I've read, but you know what's interesting? 
[01:07:30]  This is what's even more...  Not Tom anymore.  No.  No, I'm teasing, of course.  This is what's more interesting.  They want to know why.  We're going to sneak some booze into the hospital for you.  We want the old tippy Tom back.  We'll put some Jack Daniels in the RV.  Tom, just repeat after Anthony.  Yeah, now, you've got to say, you don't die from AIDS.  You do not die of AIDS.  Okay, that's good enough.  You die of something else.  All right, that's good.  Here's the way you said it up in the studio that day.  Okay, listen closely.  You don't die of AIDS! 
[01:08:00]  You see, you're yelling.  Booze takes the gayness out of you, is what we're trying to say.  Booze kind of takes that gay edge off of you.  You don't sound really as gay.  And you sound like you have a lot more energy.  You don't die of AIDS!  Now, the last thing you said was, you don't like queers, do you?  Was that it? 
[01:08:30]  Did I say that?  Yeah.  I said, I don't like queers?  No, no.  You said that the people around you that day, you were talking to them and said, you don't  like queers.  Yeah, I think a lot of them don't.  Really?  On behalf of a mom.  Just say, you don't like queers.  You don't like queers.  All right, and here's how you said it in the studio that day.  Now, you don't like queers?  Is that what you're saying?  See, you sound a little different.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old. 
[01:09:00]  You were really cooking that day, Tom.  Well, I was probably feeling kind of good that day.  Yeah, you told us all kinds of stories about how you would have sex with other men behind  the dumpsters.  Oh, that's plausible.  Yeah.  And, well, not only behind dumpsters.  Well, that's the one that you were telling us about, an instance where, you know, he bent  over and then you bent over and there were all kinds of favors being given. 
[01:09:30]  Well, there was one time when I was about 10 years old, right?  And this is very, this is a real story, too.  And this guy, Eugene, I used to hang out with.  We used to hang out in these old, you know, these houses that they were building, right?  And this is how I got my hemorrhoid.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I, I, I, we were playing around and he wanted to, you know, he wanted to do the thing from 
[01:10:00]  behind.  Right.  And so what happened was this, is that when I bent over, um, he struck a match and, um,  and I think that's how I got my hemorrhoid, I can't say.  He, he, he lit a match and then touched it to your balloon knot, let's just say.  He, he, right, he touched it to my, uh.  Well, why the hell would he do that, Tom?  Well, that's what I don't understand.  And he thought it was funny, he was laughing.  He wanted a hot piece of ass.  Uh, um. 
[01:10:30]  Right?  I'm, I, I'm saying, wait a minute, you don't, why are you heating it up like that?  And, uh, and, uh, and, uh, I mean, it was like that.  Right.  And, and, uh, and that's how I got my hemorrhoid.  Since you were ten?  Around, yeah, eight or nine or ten or something like that.  And so, you know what I did to him?  Why, what?  Uh, late at night, I once took my dad's hacksaw.  Yeah.  And I hacksawled his bike halfway down through, right?  Oh, his bicycle? 
[01:11:00]  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  So he comes from riding down the road, like, he goes, we're mad at each other now.  I was mad at him.  Well, you had good reason there, Tippy Tom.  My, my hiney all hurt.  Oh, hey!  He said, he said hiney, so that probably, uh, skated through.  Yeah.  You didn't say hiney.  You were, you were hurting, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So, so he comes riding down the road, like, a big shot, and his bike split in half.  And one end went that way, and I'm just laughing.  I'm just, oh, what happened?  Yeah.  Well, you sure got him. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, I did.  And this is, that's a true story.  He falls off his bike.  You got a match in the keister.  All right, we should get out of here, man.  Yeah, Tom, uh, well, uh, get well soon.  Yeah.  Uh, we'll keep, uh, getting updates on you, and maybe, um, when you get out, and you're  all shaved up nice and everything, you can come in, and we can get you drunk again.  And we can get this thing going.  Now, you know, you know, you guys had a whole nice little selection there underneath the  coffee table.  Of music or booze? 
[01:12:00]  Booze.  Oh, booze.  Are you going to go back to the booze?  Well, well, no, I'm going to just try to stick with beer.  Oh, there you go.  Okay.  That always works.  Thank you, Jamie Gumm.  All right.  Well, are we done?  Uh, yeah.  All right.  I'll keep in touch.  Um, I, I, I got Keith's number.  I'll figure out your number.  And, um, maybe in about a week, might take me two weeks to get over this.  I don't know.  All right, Tippi Tom.  I hope your foot, uh, feels better, sir.  Thank you for letting me on the air.  And I'll try to come up with, I'll try to be a little more energetic. 
[01:12:30]  Take care of yourself.  There he goes.  Tippi Tom.  Live from the hospital.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old.  What happened?  You're, you're killing everyone around you.  Yeah.  What are you doing to yourself?  Oh, my God.  Wow, that is completely, what did you do to him?  What did you people do to him, Keith?  Do you want to move on to Blue or something?  You want me to pick up somebody else?  Maybe we need a new homeless guy. 
[01:13:00]  A new character?  You can't be straightening these people out.  It ruins the bitch.  This AA crap stinks.  I think rock and roll Tommy cleaned up his act.  Oh, no.  We got to get off.  What about the show?  Come on.  We got to get new guys this year.  What about little Ziggy?  Now, Ziggy, we haven't seen.  Remember, he cleaned up when we had him up here.  Yeah.  He was boring, too.  But I think he's back on the source.  Thank God.  Let's shoot for him next time.  What are these homeless people?  What do they have to not drink for?  They got to drink. 
[01:13:30]  You're in hell.  Let me tell you.  Yeah, the boost takes the gayness out of him.  Takes the gayness.  Listen to him.  You don't die of AIDS.  And then he's like, I have a theory.  You don't die of AIDS.  Sounds like Mr. Blackwell, the fashion guy.  That's horrible.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh.  And then we got to, you don't die of AIDS.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot.  I'm two years old.  And he says that, and you're like, what?  You don't sound like a faggot. 
[01:14:00]  Yes, I was.  Remember, a match was lit, and my balloon knot was hit with a lit match.  That's what gave me the hemorrhoid.  Not the miles of sea that has been in there since I had been that age.  Hey, Keith, what's up?  Opie.  Yeah.  You are the coldest heart.  I mean, you are just ruthless.  What did I do?  Oh, my God.  I've been nice to two girls today.  Oh, nice to two, and just about 40 yesterday. 
[01:14:30]  Then poor Tippi Tom comes on.  Oh, you're not a drunk, slithering piece of dog crap.  I'm just going to, you're not good for the show today, so I'm just going to make fun of you while you're laying there in bed.  I'm painkillers, man.  You're just ruthless.  You have a heart at all.  Hold on.  Yeah.  I was out of that conversation.  Anthony was talking to him.  Yeah, come on, Opie, man.  All right.  Your little comment you make from the sidelines say way more than Anthony could ever say, man.  You're not supposed to know this is that good.  Yeah, go on. 
[01:15:00]  All right, stop.  I'm not speaking the truth.  Who's bummed?  Who's bummed?  I'm bummed.  Thank you.  Didn't we have another guess that something like that happened to another character?  Yeah, the kid that came in for the staple gun bit.  Oh, God damn.  What a disappointment that was.  We were so excited.  We thought we found a new, you know, character for the show.  Smokey.  Smokey.  Smokey.  We were sure he was retarded.  We were certain he was retarded. 
[01:15:30]  And he was drunk off his ass.  He was doing the staple in the ass contest.  And he was the hit of the show that day.  Next day, he calls up.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  We're like, who's this?  Whoa, I had a little too much to drink yesterday.  Yeah, it was a little dry.  Sorry if I was out of control, but that won't happen again.  But I hear you want me to be a new character on the show.  No.  Not you.  The Smokey that was in yesterday.  And now Tippi Tom.  Hi.  Hi.  We could drive down to go south a few blocks and get 20 of those guys. 
[01:16:00]  God, this picture with a shave and an ascot on it.  I pictured him laying there.  Big, oversized Charles Nelson Reilly type glasses.  Big glasses on.  And the robe, the robe pulled up like he's holding it way up to his neck.  It's very chilly in here.  I'm feeling a chill.  A bit of a chill.  I don't know.  I want to get out of here, but it's nice.  They've cleaned me up a bit. 
[01:16:30]  And I'm just picturing him laying there like, what happened to this guy?  You don't die of age.  Where is he?  Where is this guy?  I got to play this.  You goddamn EMS people, you ruin everything.  Who reported him that his foot was falling off?  I think he just fell down in the street.  And someone picked him up?  The person that picked him up off the street should be fired.  You're ruining our show, you bastards.  Stop.  You leave him in the street.  So what?  He loses a foot.  He still come up?  There are a lot of people bummed today. 
[01:17:00]  I'll say it again.  The booze takes the gayness out of you.  Well.  He's like, oh, I've been gay.  And it's like, but he's talking like he was bi and, you know, he had the girlfriend.  So it was like, you know, this homeless guy, he's out of his mind or something.  And then, well, you just saw the phone.  Yes.  Well, I'm on some medication, so I don't sound as up and peppy as I usually do.  No, you sound really gay.  Here's the tippy-tom alcohol service thing. 
[01:17:30]  All right, let's listen.  Does this mean we can't put more of these type of bits together?  No.  This is what my body, and you think I'm sexy.  Come on, baby, let me know.  Lonely?  You're damn right.  Looking for the time of your life?  Are you single?  Hygiene, not an issue.  Hepatitis C, which I've had for 20 years.  Sit back, lube up, and dial tippy-tom.  I'm a slut.  He's homeless, smells like a dumpster, and he's horny. 
[01:18:00]  Can you lick my b***h?  For a bottle of Thunderbird, he's all yours.  I'm a human being.  Okay.  I want a b***h.  Guys.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot when I was two years old.  Girls.  I have girlfriends, too.  He's so drunk, he doesn't care.  All right, who's next?  Just name the place, and he'll be there.  We're out behind a dumpster or something like that.  Call 1-900-SYPHILIS for the ride of your life. 
[01:18:30]  I know how to shake my dick.  Not responsible for any diseases contracted as a result of sex with Diffy Tom.  You're damn right.  The Opie and Anthony F. Uline is there for you when life sucks.  Sucks.  Two, three, four.  She's always dancing down the street.  She's got the suede blue eyes. 
[01:19:00]  And every new boy that she meets, he don't know a real surprise.  Here she comes again, she's dancing with the starry skies.  Here she comes again, she's dancing with the starry skies.  I like the way, I like the way she feels.  She's my best friend's girl.  She's my best friend's girl. 
[01:19:30]  She used to be mine.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  We've got a house band today, Hey C. Dixie, with Farley Scotch on vocals.  They're performing tonight at the bottom line.  Their new CD's called Hillbilly Tribute to Mountain Love, Anthony.  There you go.  Well, we've got lots going on today.  It's kind of a party.  Yeah.  You know, we're just kind of hanging.  A lot of people around the joint today.  And, uh, both of us are very disappointed that Tippi Tom is, uh, is so gay. 
[01:20:00]  You know?  Yeah.  That and he's no fun when he's sober.  No.  You know, we just talked to him on the phone.  He was at the hospital.  He had this foot injury that was turning gangrenous.  Yeah.  And they brought him in.  And you remember the last time he was in, he sounded like this.  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old.  You don't die of AIDS.  Now, you don't like queers?  Is that what you're saying?  No, he said he was gay.  You know, at least bi.  Uh, but he didn't really sound it there.  Yeah. 
[01:20:30]  When he was here in the studio.  We got him on the phone at the hospital.  Completely sober.  They cleaned him up.  He may be on some kind of anti-depressive medication.  I don't know.  But he was, uh, he was an older gay man.  He sounded very gay.  Pretty much it.  Uh, yes.  Well, I, I would love to come up and see you guys again.  Real soon.  Real soon.  Well, with that said, we had a huge surprise for Tippi Tom today.  Yeah.  Um, that ain't happening because he's in the, in the hospital.  Mm-hmm.  And I don't think it really fits anyone that's here today. 
[01:21:00]  No, the good old boys, uh, I don't think they want our little surprise.  They made that perfectly clear to, to us during the commercials.  Hey, see, Dixie would like the, uh, surprise that was meant for Tippi Tom?  No.  Um, and now we're learning that the, the big surprise?  Yeah.  Doesn't like elevators.  The big surprise has a fear of, of elevators.  So now Rick is downstairs.  Rick.  Of this very building.  Yeah.  Hey guys.  So what's the, what's the story with the big surprise?  All right.  Well, the big surprise came in two parts. 
[01:21:30]  The first part had no problem getting upstairs.  The second part, um, doesn't like elevators.  For what reason?  Um, I don't know.  I didn't ask him about it, but he wasn't allowed to take the stairs either.  So he was stuck downstairs in the lobby.  Well, what's the problem with the elevator?  Do you want to ask him?  His name is Danny.  I don't know.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's talk to Danny.  All right.  Here's Danny. 
[01:22:00]  Hello.  Danny.  Yes.  What's, what's, uh, what's the deal with the elevators?  Don't like them, huh?  Excuse me?  Nah, I got stuck in one once.  And what happened?  I got stuck in one.  That's all.  Yeah, but is it Anthony or Opie?  Uh, both.  Yeah.  Hey, how you guys doing?  All right.  So you have a fear of elevators?  Yeah, I know you guys are going to bust my chops.  Yep.  Oh, we're not really busting your chops.  That must be really inconvenient.  Yeah, it is.  Especially when you get, especially when you got to do your thing.  You know what I'm saying?  So we have to, we're not even going to be able to, the guy's not there anyways, right? 
[01:22:30]  So I have to go down.  We're bringing the big surprise, uh, somewhere else.  So you're going to follow Rick and, uh, and someone, and the other guy down there.  Okay?  Don't worry.  I put a show on for you, for everybody.  Don't worry about it.  Well, uh, you can put the show on for Tom.  In a way, we're glad you're, uh, you're scared of elevators.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  I might come back up there now just for you guys trying to insult me now.  Oh, the staircase is, uh, very shaky.  I think they've closed it.  Yeah.  You have to take the elevator.  Actually, the only way to get up here now is the window washer platform on the outside 
[01:23:00]  of the building.  Yeah.  Good luck getting up here.  Very hard to get up here.  If you can scale walls, we'll, uh, we'll meet you in a little while.  Okay?  Okay.  All right.  Well, you're not going to tell us more about this elevator thing?  Nope.  I didn't come in for the elevator.  You just got stuck in an elevator once and decided that's it.  You're never going in another elevator.  Right?  I got a lot of people listening.  You know, this is, uh, wrong.  I knew you guys would do something.  We haven't even done anything.  You don't have to. 
[01:23:30]  We're just talking about the, uh, fear of, uh, elevators.  A lot of people have that.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  It's all right.  There's a story there that we're trying to get out of you.  That's all.  Yeah.  Well, I wanted to meet you guys, too, so.  Well, if you could scale that wall, we'll, uh, we'll shake hands and, and take some pictures  together, okay?  No, I'll come, I'll come back up the elevator when I get back here from, uh, wherever I gotta go.  Are you going to see me?  Yeah, I'm coming back, I'm coming back up there.  All right.  All right?  All right, well, why don't you, uh, take care of the big surprise and, and we'll talk to you  in a little while, all right?  Okay.  It's Danny, the big surprise, Anthony. 
[01:24:00]  Uh-huh.  Thank you, Rick.  There we go.  They're on their way to a surprise tippy Tom at the hospital.  Yeah.  And hopefully we'll have it on the radio in a little while.  Thank God.  Okay, Anthony.  It's almost a good thing that, uh, Tom's in the hospital.  Yeah, well, let's get the piece of ass back in the studio.  Nora from Atlanta.  You can call her Nora.  Nora, Nora, the piece of ass.  Here she comes.  Nora?  Hi, Nora.  How did the, um, you know, just step up to that mic right there.  Okay.  How did that photo shoot go? 
[01:24:30]  I'm just kidding.  Wow.  Too bad.  It went, uh, it went really well.  Yeah.  He was a great photographer.  I can't wait to work with him again.  Really?  Wow.  Look at that.  Did he put you in any poses?  Oh, he was posing me.  I was up on the table, you know?  Yeah.  He did, though.  He did a good job.  Really?  Oh, great.  Have you seen the pictures?  Not just being nice.  No, we're like waiting.  They'll be up on opianthony.com very shortly.  We're waiting for the people to...  Here, I want to give you guys, um, my cards.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Oh, thank you.  Oh. 
[01:25:00]  Siren.com.  There you are.  Nora's featured with many other lovelies from around the country.  You should, uh, have those girls on for the WOW contest.  Wow.  Yeah, they are WOW.  You're, you're WOW too.  Oh, thank you very much.  You, you're WOW too.  You're WOW too.  Um, but hey guys, uh, we're having a big party, um, up in the Hamptons, August the 3rd.  I would love for you to come and hang out with us.  The Hamptons parties.  The Hamptons dolly, yes.  Do we look like Hamptons?  I know.  Do I look like Hamptons? 
[01:25:30]  No, I'm country as hell, so come on with me.  Hang out with me.  Yeah, you got something else going on, though, that I think they want to see out there in  the Hamptons, you know?  What is that?  Pretty girl.  Yeah.  That's it.  But it's at the tavern, August the 3rd.  Come, come hang out with us.  Out of the Hamptons, Opie.  With the...  I go out all the time.  I take the helicopter out there.  Yeah, with the Siren.com girls.  Yes.  All right, Nora, thank you so much.  Thank you very much, guys.  Thank you, Nora.  Enjoy, uh, your stay in New York, all right?  Thank you very much.  We're going to watch you leave now.  More pictures are up on...  She's shaking her ass.  More pictures are up on OpieAndAnthony.com for the WOW Contest. 
[01:26:00]  And I'm breaking the door.  That's okay.  That's okay.  Uh, you got to see contestant number 110.  Wow.  Wow.  Speaking of the WOW Contest, it's Steve's turn to kick someone out of the WOW Contest.  Oh!  We've been doing this all day long.  All of us have, uh, uh, one, one, one vote, whatever you want to call it.  One opportunity to knock one of the girls out of the WOW Contest.  So far, uh, Stinky knocked out a girl, Ben knocked out a girl, and we had one girl call  up and perform Harry Caray on herself.  We're, uh, giving that option to the girls in the contest. 
[01:26:30]  They want to call up and then, uh, kick themselves out of the contest, because they maybe looked  over the girls and said, look, I know I'm not worthy.  I know I'm just going to get, uh, uh, thrown out of this at some point.  So, I'll go out with a little dignity and remove myself.  And one girl did it already.  And one listener will have a chance to knock one of the girls out of the contest.  Yes.  Uh, with that said, Steve from foundrymusic.com in the studio, and he wants to knock out a  girl.  Yes, I do. 
[01:27:00]  Um, and then before you actually say who it is, please tell us why you chose this girl,  and then give us the number and the name.  I feel bad because, uh, she's the only representative, I think, from this part of the country.  Oh, my God, you're knocking out a whole city from the competition.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  I think so.  An entire city.  Hold on.  We'll get the number up.  It's going to be thrown out.  Yeah.  I think she's the only person from this particular city.  You can't do that. 
[01:27:30]  And why did you, uh, decide to throw her out?  Moose face, uneven boobs.  Uh, she, uh, enough makeup to put a clown, uh, clown outfit together.  She looks like some male celebrity.  I really can't place it, but, you know, there's just a whole myriad of, of, of, of human deformity  going on there, and I really don't believe she needs to be in a, in a best wow concert.  Can I add something, too?  Yeah, absolutely.  They only took one picture.  Yeah, that, too.  Oh.  Some of the hot girls that come through the, our studio, we take hundreds. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  Okay, give me the number.  I gotta know.  Number 73, Andrea from Portland.  Number 73.  You just knocked out Portland.  Yeah.  Not just a girl.  You knocked out the whole city from the wow contest.  Andrea.  Yeah!  From Portland.  There she is.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  The Pacific Northwest.  Rainy and ugly ass.  Jesus.  Wow, Steve.  You didn't like the unevenness of the boobs?  You know, you could, you could overlook that if she was something more to look at up top. 
[01:28:30]  I mean, she should have done the, uh, the headless shot, maybe.  You know, I cannot stand that tweezed and then drawn in eyebrow thing.  Like, what the hell is that about, ladies?  Can you sell me on this one?  I don't understand the girls that pluck all of their eyebrows out and then draw them in.  Me, me, me.  Me, me, me.  And draw them in with a little pencil.  That was a style in the early 60s.  Yeah.  It's now 2002.  It doesn't look good. 
[01:29:00]  Well, all right.  73 is on the wow contest.  Steve's choice, 73, gone.  And you got to go to opianthony.com.  Lots of new girls up there since yesterday.  I'm glad, uh, Steve didn't pick the one I want to throw out.  Hey, Rick.  We think I got a new arrow.  Hey.  What's up, Rick?  Are you guys on the way to Tippy Tom?  All right.  This is you guys.  Oh, yeah.  We're on our way.  We're, uh, we're cruising through, uh, Times Square right now. 
[01:29:30]  All right.  Oh, you just wanted to talk to Stinky off here?  Yeah.  All right.  Hold on.  Rick's on his way to surprise Tippy Tom at the hospital.  Great.  Is Rick going to be part of the big surprise?  Oh, I'm sure he's going to want to edge himself in there for a good view.  Get a good one.  Hey, Rick.  Screw you guys.  Are you all excited?  That's you.  I kept my mouth shut.  I took this one for the team to go down with this thing.  And now you're going to go down.  Happy to be here.  All right. 
[01:30:00]  So you're going down.  You look like the other guy.  Are you done?  Yeah.  Good.  All right.  Yeah.  Move along.  Keep your head up.  Hold your head up.  Okay.  Oh, Nora's pictures are up.  They are?  Yeah.  Can I see real fast?  Yeah.  We got to take another break.  Oh, Rick made her do the hands over the head thing.  And that mosquito bite is just blazing right through.  I thought I was only in the mosquito bite. 
[01:30:30]  She was worried about the mosquito bite.  I know.  Rick snapped one right when her arms are up.  So she got the mosquito bite thing.  You know, the lighting on her pictures are a little weird.  What happened?  Is that because we have the outside studio set up for the band today?  Oh, that might have taken away something.  Yeah, because the band is in there now.  So he didn't have his photo spot that he usually uses.  It looks like he had to use it somewhere else.  Yeah.  I don't think he got the lighting right.  Uh-oh.  Very pretty girl, though.  All right.  Why don't we take a quick break so we can do lots of radio when we get back? 
[01:31:00]  Yes.  We got the top 50 worst movies of all time.  Yeah.  That we're going to get into a little bit.  And it's Rick's pick next.  Oh, but he's not.  So are you ready to pick?  We're going to have to wait.  I have been ready since we started the show.  I know I am not wavering on this at all.  I thought she should have been out when we picked the 10.  Is my pick still left, too?  Yeah, I think yours is, too.  So why don't we both pick next?  Okay, we can do that.  Angel has exploded from my seat. 
[01:31:30]  She was pure like snowflakes.  No one could ever stay.  The memory of my angel never caused me pain.  Years go by, I'm looking through a girl in a magazine.  There's my homeroom angel on the page.  She's in between.  My blood runs cold.  My memory has just been sold.  Angel is a cinephold.  Angel is a cinephold.  My blood runs cold.  My memory has just been sold.  Angel is a cinephold.  Slipping notes under the desk.  I was thinking about her dress. 
[01:32:00]  I was shy, turned away before she caught my eye.  I was shaking in my shoes whenever she flashed into my boots.  Something that'll hold on me when angel plastic was fine.  Soft, fluffy sweaters, too magical to touch.  I see her in that naked gaze.  Here's just too much.  My blood runs cold.  My memory has just been sold.  Angel is a cinephold.  Angel is a cinephold.  My blood runs cold.  My memory has just been sold.  Angel is a cinephold. 
[01:32:30]  Here's checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got a house band today.  Hey C. Dixie with Barley Scotch on vocals.  They're playing tonight at the bottom line here in New York City.  Their new CD's called Hillbilly Tribute to Mountain Love, Anthony.  And they're helping us out today with the program.  Very good.  Kind of just screwing off, you know?  Andrew, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's going on today?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, will somebody check on Norton and make sure he didn't commit suicide?  I think he was turning around as the week went on.  Yeah.  I think he's okay. 
[01:33:00]  I think he spent the whole night thinking about two fists at a tip.  Well, he's got to get here soon because we're all traveling tonight.  We'll get him on the radio.  Okay.  He's missing our rally, Anthony.  Yeah.  Got a great rally going on here.  Big rally.  We have to have at least 15 people here.  Is it 15?  No, it's been lowered.  I think 13.  13.  13?  Yeah.  13 people make a rally.  13 people make an official rally?  Right.  Oh, well, we've got a few more than that.  Yeah.  So we're doing good with our rally. 
[01:33:30]  Opie, I've been informed of one of our, another one of our contestants.  Yeah?  Porn star.  Porn star.  I'm looking at some pictures right now.  Which one?  Contestant number.  Newly added, 109.  Deanne from Vegas.  The one that's holding the, I want Norton's mule sign.  Yeah.  She, apparently here, I've just been informed, is known as Air Force Amy from the Bunny Ranch. 
[01:34:00]  And here are some pictures.  Hey, look at that.  There's something that you don't see every day.  Wow.  Norton's going to like that one right here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He always talks about that on girls.  He likes when they're like that.  Yeah.  Okay.  A little plump.  Anthony?  Yeah.  It's time to kick two more girls out of the wow contest.  Wait, what the hell is that?  He loves it like that.  No, look. 
[01:34:30]  What is that?  What is that thing?  What is that?  There's something.  It looks like a tube.  It looks like a, looks like one of those plastic lures you use to, you know, the plastic  wiggly lures.  Right, a wiggly lure to get those big mouth bass.  Well.  Oh, God, no.  Looks like it caught a small mouth bass.  Maybe another picture will clear that view up. 
[01:35:00]  No?  Oh, man.  Jay, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  I'm stoned.  I just left my friend's house and I heard that song.  Jesus Christ.  I'm going to be laughing for a frigging month.  Okay.  He's having a good time.  Sure, why not?  Rick, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm at the hospital.  Oh, okay.  Good.  And in the room of the one and only Tippi Tom.  How does he look?  I didn't recognize him. 
[01:35:30]  Really?  Keith was truly correct.  He does not look like when we last saw him.  He almost looks like a, I don't know, Robert Redford-ish.  Stop it.  I'm serious.  Oh, that's wonderful.  They shaved his beard, right?  They shaved his beard.  Uh-huh.  Did you take the digital camera?  Of course I did.  Oh, take some pictures of Tippi Tom.  Because we'll do a whole before and after thing.  Yes.  Because we got the old pictures of Tippi Tom.  Right.  He looks totally different.  And, I mean, if you saw this guy right now, you would not recognize him. 
[01:36:00]  Robert Redford-ish.  Yes.  Very.  But his surprise is in the other room changing right now.  So it's going to be out in a second.  You want to make one million dollars?  Let me sleep with your boyfriend.  I'll give you a million dollars.  So his surprise is getting ready.  His surprise is almost ready.  What do they need to do what they have to do?  Well, he would need some music, but he might be able to do it without the music. 
[01:36:30]  Does Tippi Tom have any clue what's going on?  Tippi Tom, do you have any clue what we're bringing you here for your surprise today?  Hello.  What's that?  Hi.  Hi, Tom.  How are you speaking to me?  It's Opie and Anthony again, Tom.  Hello?  Opie and Anthony again.  Oh, how are you doing?  Hi.  We brought you a little surprise.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  Oh, you know, you're the only visitors I've had.  Well, you have a couple of more that are coming to see you. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, come on.  They're getting ready right now, and they're going to come into your room.  And it's going to be wonderful.  All I know is I had such a good time when we went on that shoppings break.  Oh, shoppings.  That's right.  That's when we met you.  All right, put Rick back on the phone.  Oh, Rick's with the dark hair, the one I was just on. 
[01:37:30]  Hey, Tippi Tom, do you think Rick is hot?  Huh?  Do you think Rick is hot?  Is he hot?  Yeah.  He's real good looking.  I think he's real good looking.  What are you, crazy?  Would you give him a baby?  I come in fourth place around here.  Would you burn his balloon knot with a match?  He sounds like Tom from New Orleans.  Yeah.  A little bit.  All right.  Where are you originally from?  Huh?  Where are you originally from? 
[01:38:00]  Originally, I'm from New Jersey.  Jersey.  And then you went out to San Francisco.  Well, no, I went out to Reno, Nevada and San Francisco.  San Francisco.  He never said it like that.  I know.  If you guys are just getting in your cars, you missed a whole thing.  Tippi Tom was supposed to be here, but we found out he's in the hospital because his foot might fall off.  Turns out his foot is going to be saved, but he's really sober and they cleaned his beard and now he sounds really gay.  You do sound a lot gayer than you did when you were up here, Tom. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, you mean I sound more gay now?  Yeah, you sound a lot more gay now than you did when you were up here.  Well, I'm more gay when I'm straight.  When I'm...  How about that?  When I get a little drunk, I get a little less gay.  I get a little more faggity.  You'll get a little more butch when you're drinking.  A little more butch.  All right.  Where's Rick?  I put Rick back on.  Here.  Here.  Here's Rick right here.  He's the good-looking boy with the muscles.  All right.  Hey, guys.  This show is too gay, man. 
[01:39:00]  It's the...  Yes.  Hand the phone to the good-looking boy with the muscles.  It's amazing how true it is.  What, that you're good-looking and have muscles?  Besides that, he really...  Dude, when he talks, he really looks gay.  Of course he is.  No, but I mean like his hand moves a certain way.  Oh, really?  He's got all the dress just down.  I can't wait to see.  But as he's laying there in his drug-induced half coma, he doesn't look it until he starts  to, you know, talk and move.  Can he get out of his bed? 
[01:39:30]  Because you've got to get...  I don't think so because he's got his legs pretty well wrapped up.  He can't open.  He's got a leg injury.  He's not going to get out of bed.  You've got to prop him up nice so he can do a before and after picture thing with him.  But he does have shaved legs.  Oh, really?  It looked...  Yeah.  All right, Rick, we've got to go with this surprise.  All right.  Yeah.  Is it ready?  Danny, you ready?  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  Give the phone back to Tom then.  All right.  We're going to give the phone to Tom.  Tom, you ready?  And then to the big surprise.  And here's your surprise.  Tom?  Tom?  Oh, hi.  Tom, here's your surprise. 
[01:40:00]  Just let us know how you like it.  It's your birthday, yeah.  Yeah, it's your birthday, buddy.  Give you a little dance there.  Let me take a look at this here.  Woo!  See, I used to look like that.  Oh.  Yes.  Yes.  I...  Oh, no.  Mr. America.  Is he in a Mr. America uniform, I guess?  Oh, my goodness.  What does he look like, Tom?  I mean, this is material. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, God.  Gee whiz.  What's he doing?  Um, I'm not quite sure what he's doing yet.  He's going to figure it out in a minute.  What's he wearing, Tom?  Um, well, he's got a tuxedo on.  Yeah.  You like it?  You like it or no?  How can you not like it?  How can you not like it?  How can you not like it?  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, why don't they have a song or something? 
[01:41:00]  Right?  Well, maybe we can put one on low in the background here.  Come on, Rick.  Come on, Rick.  Get him into it.  Come on, get into it.  Howdy, faggot.  I'm dizzy right now.  He's all dizzy.  My blood pressure's rising.  So what's going on there, Tibby Tom?  Um...  He's dancing.  Tom, what's your name?  Tom.  It's a big name.  It's a big name.  One, two, three. 
[01:41:30]  What side do you want first?  Tom, what are you doing?  Well, what I'm doing is I'm farming something.  He needs a little more farming.  What are you doing to him?  What are you doing to him, Tom?  That's solid.  That's solid.  Tom, what are you doing to him?  That's solid.  Let's see.  You can't touch that.  Tom?  Oh, you can't touch that.  What did he go to grab for?  Oh!  Oh, oh. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, look at that.  I thought this was my oxygen line.  Feel these bites.  You're in good shape.  Oh, he's feeling them.  I'm going to look like that in about six months.  Yeah, right.  I'm going to look like that.  Wonderful.  All right, Tom.  You like your surprise?  Hmm?  You like the surprise?  Yeah.  Now I've got to wait until I get healthy and get my confidence up. 
[01:42:30]  I don't know if I'm going to quite compete with that, but...  You got anything going on because of your surprise?  Hmm?  You got anything going on?  I don't have anything going on.  I don't even want to know the answer to that goddamn question.  Tom, were you spanking him?  Just a little bit.  And did you try to grab his junk?  Yeah, but he said that was, you know, not yet.  He reached over and tried to...  I thought it was the button to call for the nerves. 
[01:43:00]  I grabbed the hose and I was pushing the button.  Ah, well, that's great, Tom.  Is it making you feel better?  Yeah, I feel now a lot better.  Oh, okay.  Right.  Hey, Tom, can you repeat after me?  Well, I have to admit, that was pretty good looking there.  Right.  Can you repeat after me? 
[01:43:30]  That, that, that...  Oh, this is going to take forever.  I just wanted to say, boo-boo-boo-boo-boy.  What's his name and his phone number?  All right, hey, Tom, give the phone back to Rick.  Oh, okay, yeah.  I need someone to paint a picture here.  I got to know what the hell was going on in there.  He's so fixated on the young man.  All right.  Rick, what happened?  Um, well, he got a little, uh, laying down lap dance type of thing.  Ah!  Why wasn't there any music?  Well, because we didn't have any music.  Okay.  You didn't have a boombox? 
[01:44:00]  Plus, if we did, they probably, the nurses probably would have ran in here and stopped us.  All right, so, uh, the guy got pretty much, uh...  Yeah, I've got, I've got pictures, not pictures that I'm proud of, not pictures that I want to look at.  Right, but they're pictures nonetheless.  But they're pictures nonetheless.  All right, and is it true that Tippy Tom, uh, went for a grab?  He went for several grabs.  He did the, uh, tushy squeeze.  He was, uh, checking the firmness of several parts of his body, sure.  Sure.  And it looked like he enjoyed himself?  Oh. 
[01:44:30]  He looked like he didn't know where to start.  Now, you, you don't like queers?  Is that what you're saying?  All right, this is, this has become one of the weirdest days, I'll tell you.  Ugh.  All right, Rick, thank you.  All right, guys, I hate you.  Can't wait to see the pictures.  Sure.  All right.  There they go.  And, uh, Tippy Tom enjoying his, uh, male, uh...  Dancer.  Lap dance.  Male dancer.  Oh.  So, it would have been a lot better in studio with a drunk Tippy Tom, but, there you go. 
[01:45:00]  Blah.  Huh?  It's from Hunk-tasia.  Um, Hunk-tasia.  Oh, is that what it is?  The guy was from Hunk-tasia.  Hunk-tasia?  Hunk-tasia.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The hottest male dancers in Jersey, Anthony.  Are you reading it, Ovi?  Hunk-tasia.  What are some of the things we can look for at Hunk-tasia?  I think we're going to be doing an official live read for this podcast in a little while,  but, uh, if you're looking for hot dancers, hunky waiters, and massage guys, check out 
[01:45:30]  Hunk-tasia.  Yeah.  Male review.  Baby.  Yeah.  Well, we'll get the phone number quick.  973-983-0968.  They do breakup parties?  Oh, that's great.  Give the women that move.  Guys break up, and what do we got to do?  We got to go out with our dopey friends, maybe to a boobie bar.  They have breakup parties where you just know it's like, woo!  Woo!  Oh, God! 
[01:46:00]  I just broke up with my boyfriend!  Blah!  Blah!  Blah!  There's the guy sitting home.  Maybe I could get back with her.  Fast forward.  Hunk-tasia.  Bah!  Bah!  Bah!  Bah!  Bah!  Bah!  Bah!  Bah!  The dancers are so hot!  Blah!  Blah!  Blah!  Blah!  Blah!  Blah!  Blah!  Blah!  Blah!  Blah!  Blah!  The girls get enough. 
[01:46:30]  Birthday parties.  Jesus.  Bachelorette parties.  All right.  Private parties.  And private hospital room parties.  Right.  Wow.  It's Honktasia.  Honktasia.  973-983-0968.  We want to thank the big surprise from Honktasia.  There you go.  For helping us out today.  I don't think that guy's gay, though.  No, a lot of those guys get more trim than anybody.  He's coming back here.  We'll find out, I guess.  Wow.  Fine. 
[01:47:00]  By asking him.  Wonderful.  All right.  Is Hasey Dixie ready to play us in a break, maybe?  Okay.  We can.  Oh, you can hear us, Paul.  You can hear us out there.  Oh, God.  Man.  We're going to play a little something in a break.  Yes, sir.  They're playing tonight at the bottom line here in New York City.  When we get back, Anthony, we kick two more girls out of the WOW contest.  Yeah, I want to kick that girl out.  And in case you're just tuning in, we'll explain what the hell we've been doing all day.  We don't even know, but we'll try to explain it next. 
[01:47:30]  Okay.  Roy.  All right.  Guys, whenever you're ready.  We're ready, huh?  Let it rip.  I've been ready for 32 years.  Do that.  Go.  Go.  Right there.  Yeah.  The Red Hot Chili Peppers, by the way. 
[01:48:00]  Those guys have another smash on their hands.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  I guess we've got to say goodbye to our house band.  Hallelujah.  They've got things to do, huh?  Well, they've got some shows.  Tonight, they're playing the bottom line.  And then tomorrow night, they're going to be at the Black Potato Festival in Clinton,  New Jersey.  We're talking about Hayseed Dixie.  Going to be testifying.  Going to be bearing witness to the solemn truth that that lost highway of Hank Williams,  that highway to hell over the same road.  Verily, verily, brother.  Tell it like it is.  I'm going to be drinking.  Yeah. 
[01:48:30]  Goddamn, man.  That sounded great.  We're going to go down the list.  We're going to all be drinking.  Great job.  Very talented, you know?  Thank you.  Thanks.  We like the harmonies a lot.  Yeah.  A real lot.  And that fiddle playing.  We like the beer you provided us with here in the studio.  Whatever you need, man.  I was going to provide you with some other stuff, but that's when Ken Stevens was walking  down the hall, so I had to stop myself.  What were you going to provide me with, bro?  A little trip to the stairwell.  You can't do that just yourself personally?  Why do you got to sub that out?  Because that's Garrett, Stinky, the guy that runs the...  That's his territory. 
[01:49:00]  That's his...  We call it Club Stinky.  Velvet Rope, the whole thing.  We respect each other's territory.  Stinky takes care of the weed.  Rick takes care of the gay guys.  And we supply the beer.  Oh, we got some hydroponic gardeners in our bunch.  There you go.  And we try to take care of the laughs.  Well, down where you guys are from, you probably take up acres and acres of land with just pot,  right?  Well, you got to grow it under the pine trees, so then their revenuers can't sell.  I mean, personally, I come from a long line of the researchers in alcohol and what we 
[01:49:30]  call alternative-fueled beverage resources.  Is that it?  What we find under the cow patties.  A lot of the...  A lot of that copper tubing still kind of...  Well, like I'm saying now, I mean, I think it's a crime, y'all, that every truck, tractor,  set the tank pump, electrical generator, you name it, in this country ain't running on  alcohol right now.  Right.  NASCAR run on it.  And NASCAR's already run on it.  And what I'm telling you is we just drove down and played the Telluride Bluegrass Festival  here a while back.  Drove all the way through Kansas, right?  And I saw the light, barely, barely, hallelujah, I saw them amber waves of grain, I was looking 
[01:50:00]  at that fuel, I was looking at it.  Just diamonds in the rough, man, all that wheat, fuel.  Acres of fuel.  Man, you can run any internal combustion engine in existence on alcohol, I know, I've done  it.  You can make alcohol out of any grain, I know, I've done it.  You can't drink them all.  What I'm trying to tell you is...  No, you can't drink them all, though, right?  Well, you ain't got to.  You run the truck and the tractor off, and if we do this right, make it all right here,  man, we can be selling this stuff back to all them dudes over there that we're buying 
[01:50:30]  the oil from right now.  Yeah, man, bro.  Or just dousing them in it and lighting them.  Wait, don't just get tanked, pour some in the tank.  Oh, that's a good slogan.  Think before you drink.  Think before you drink.  Remember to save some for the ride home.  You guys got to come back and hang with us again, all right?  Yeah, you guys are a lot of fun, man.  Thank you.  You got to come out and drink with us when you get done with this show.  Well, we might...  We got to go to Philly.  Oh, no, we can't.  We're hitting the road ourselves.  We're on our way to Philly.  There ain't nothing going on, man. 
[01:51:00]  We're going to be broadcasting live from OzFest tomorrow.  OzFest tomorrow.  And then we're going up to Buffalo on Saturday for a T&A with O&A party.  Some kind of beach party in Buffalo.  There's a good chance we're going to get arrested in Buffalo on Saturday.  So there'll be a lot of drinking going on up there.  Yeah.  All right, we'll try to make you proud.  They have to get to the gig.  It's Hacy Dixie.  There's a couple albums out.  Hillbilly Tribute to Mountain Love is the new one, right?  That's right.  As in to Mount.  And the old one is Hillbilly Tribute to ACDC. 
[01:51:30]  We played that like crazy.  Hallelujah.  God, you start trying to talk like a southerner when these guys are in the studio.  Well, what are you talking about?  I'm trying.  What?  I said, we'll learn you to talk, right?  There you go.  So it's tonight at the bottom line, tomorrow night at the Black Potato Festival in Clinton,  New Jersey.  Check them out if you're in town, man.  You'll love it.  Thanks, guys.  Great job.  Thank you so much, guys.  There they go.  Bunch of good old boys.  Hell yeah, man.  You guys know where you are.  That's great.  Classic.  It's so funny listening to them going over directions. 
[01:52:00]  So now the hotel, so where do I turn?  And they're getting directions from Earl, who doesn't even know how to get to his own house.  Oh, boy.  So I don't know.  They're going to be like in the middle of the hood uptown.  Hey, boy.  You know how I could get to the bottom line?  Yeah, it's right here in this alley.  Come here.  That's the way you turn.  We got your bottom line.  All right, Anthony.  Well, we should explain that we've been knocking girls out of the WOW contest to make room for 
[01:52:30]  hotter girls.  And it's been working, man.  Yes.  We have gotten so many more hotter women.  In this contest, my grammar is just awful today.  Well, because of the good old boys.  We got so much more hotter girls.  You feel better.  Coming in here.  You feel better about yourself.  You can drop syllables and stuff.  It doesn't even matter.  But we've been clearing out a little space.  And the girls that are taking up the slack here, really hot.  Yes.  So we're dipping back into the supplier girls that we've had at the beginning of the contest 
[01:53:00]  and booting a few out.  Yeah, we have to.  Already, Ben has booted a girl out.  Today, everyone associated with the show gets a chance to boot a girl out.  Yeah.  That's what we're doing today.  And a listener is going to get a chance.  And we're also encouraging the ladies that are in this contest, some of the girls that  qualified, to perform Harry Caray on themselves.  Get out with a little dignity.  Right.  You call us up and tell us, all right, look, I know I'm not going to be one of the 20 finalists. 
[01:53:30]  I can accept that.  I want to withdraw from the contest.  Right.  Withdrawal.  Withdrawal.  Whatever.  Withdrawal.  Goddamn.  So it's up to you, Ant.  Oh, my turn to knock a girl out.  All right.  Let me pop her up here on the screen so I can then.  Here she is.  I'm looking at her pictures right now.  The next girl kicked out of the WOW contest.  This is a WOW contest. 
[01:54:00]  Right?  Right.  So we're looking at, we haven't really, we never define what WOW means as far as this  contest goes.  Of course, boobs is very important to the contest.  Yeah.  But you've got to have a nice overall look as well, I do believe.  Right.  Yeah.  Testify.  Testify.  It's a WOW contest.  So I'm looking at the girls' boobs.  But WOW isn't just the boobs.  It's the whole picture.  And this girl ain't got neither of it.  I don't like the cans. 
[01:54:30]  I don't like the whole package.  If you look at the third picture down of this girl, the boobs are pigeon-toed.  The neepies are pigeon-toed.  Look at this.  Can I take a look?  Stop it.  Oh, yeah.  And then if you go to the other shot, I'll just say who it is.  Look at the contrast when she leans back a little bit.  Yeah.  I mean, what's going on there?  They look like they've been dipped in Hershey's chocolate.  Yeah.  There's things going on. 
[01:55:00]  There's just too much going on.  There's too much chocolate on the strawberry.  So I'm saying goodbye to KXOA representative from Sacramento, California.  Contestant number 18, Renee.  Out!  Out!  Out of the contest.  Get out!  Gone.  The latest contestant to be booted.  So give that information to Scott.  To Scott, and he can put that red X and turn her picture into black and white. 
[01:55:30]  Through Renee, contestant number 18 from Sacramento.  Now, Anthony, I'm hoping the marketing department here in New York, I'm hoping they have their S together.  Because we want to throw a huge, huge finalist party.  A big party.  We're going to get the finalists.  We're not sure how many finalists we want to bring.  We're going to try to get 20 girls.  20 of the girls that are finalists.  That means we're going to be flying a lot of people into New York, and we want to throw a huge shindig together, like a roadshow slash wow finalist contest. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  We might have to charge a few bucks at the door just to get all these ladies into New York.  Nothing too crazy.  It's very minimal.  So don't freak.  Don't freak on us.  But in between, you know, bringing up some of the finalists, there'll be things that we usually do at the roadshows.  Debauchery, fun.  We'll throw a Frenchie out there.  Yeah.  We'll be a pisser.  Rich Voss will do some material, maybe.  Norton.  Yeah, we'll figure it all out.  Stephen Lynch, maybe.  Yeah.  We'll see who's around.  Brother Joe, maybe he's around.  What we could get together.  Sure.  But we're waiting for the marketing department to figure that out. 
[01:56:30]  We need a venue that holds at least 2,000 to 3,000 people.  And I know a lot of people are fans of this show in New York City, so.  Really?  2,000 to 3,000 people?  That many?  Why?  I don't know.  Maybe we can just have 13 and say we have that many.  No?  Okay.  Sorry.  Opie, I've been taking a minute to punch up your choice.  Oh, thank you, Anthony. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, I got to kick someone out.  Because it is your turn.  Now, this one might be controversial.  You know, Jim Norton should be here soon.  Because he's going to get a pick.  Is he showing up?  Stop it.  And Rick still gets a pick.  Rick gets a pick.  And hopefully another lady will call up to perform Harry Caray on herself.  You really got to assess yourself there, ladies.  If you're in this contest, take a look at all the contestants and say to yourself,  should I suffer the indignity that I may suffer if I stay in this contest? 
[01:57:30]  Can you punch my girl up?  Yes, there she is.  Okay, I think my choice is going to be controversial in a way.  I think it is, too.  Because I will say if you block out the face completely and if you chop off the picture right below the boobs,  you're looking at a very, very nice set of boobs.  Set of cans.  And it is a wow contest.  They're natural. 
[01:58:00]  They're huge.  And they're quite lovely.  Yeah.  Problem is, when you see the whole picture, there's some major problems going on.  And I know there's a lot of people out there that get mad at us that we're tossing out the girls with the natural boobs, Anthony.  Well, I've got to say, last time we had a contest like that, like this, a girl with natural breasts won the whole thing.  Oh, yeah.  The whole thing.  Yep.  All right.  Now, turn it around.  I was even willing to keep her in the contest until I saw a picture number. 
[01:58:30]  Would that be four?  Yeah, that's this one.  Four put it over the top for me.  Because she is standing there with just her panties on.  Just the panties.  And by the way.  Her huge panties.  She skated through yesterday's elimination of ten girls.  Because she has really nice, natural boobs.  If you look at just the boobs.  Yeah.  But if you put the boobs with the rest of the body, it looks like some wacky cartoon character.  Let me check that out.  Now, even with her, with the cutoff jeans still on. 
[01:59:00]  So you're saying she made the mistake when she went to this post.  That just, yeah, put it over the top.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a double bunt starting there.  Yeah.  There's a world of hurt going on in there.  So without further ado, she looks young, too, in the face.  I know.  And I know people are going to yell at me for this one.  I have a feeling.  I think so, too.  I have a feeling there's a lot of people out there that in a, I was going to say a sick way, 
[01:59:30]  but that's not nice, would be attracted to someone like this.  Dude, this is, get this, you're out drinking all night, right?  Mm-hmm.  You're waiting.  It's the end of the night.  Mm-hmm.  You drag her home with you, you're going to have some fun.  That is TF City.  Look at this area right here.  Yeah.  You grab each side.  Oh, without a doubt.  Squeeze them in.  You're going to have some fun with this girl.  Without a doubt.  But she kept her shoes on.  I mean, how did you get your panties?  Oh, because she was wearing shorts, but she's got her little sneakers and socks on. 
[02:00:00]  Which just doesn't help the whole texture.  And only her panties.  Those huge panties.  So, Anthony, with no further ado, I kick out contestant number 68.  Crystal from Philly.  From Philly.  Is getting the axe.  Yeah!  Go on.  She's out of the contest.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  That's like we were both saying.  A controversial move here, I think. 
[02:00:30]  And I think you're going to catch some flack for this one.  But the reality is that she's not going to win the contest.  The reality.  And we've got to stick with reality from time to time, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  Sabrina, one of the girls that performed Harry Caray earlier in the show from Columbus,  contestant number 29, she took herself out of the contest.  Yeah.  Right, Sabrina?  Yep.  I did.  You're calling back.  Why?  Well, you know, I think it would be a good idea if you let the girls who save face pull 
[02:01:00]  themselves out, pull another girl out with them.  Weed them out faster.  Oh.  Hmm.  So if a girl calls up and commits Harry Caray and pulls herself from the contest, she should  have the right to then pull another girl out with her.  Yeah.  Ooh, this is getting like one of those wacky Survivor shows.  I know.  But you know what?  The reality of this contest is we do have to get rid of a lot of these girls.  Yeah.  Before we give the vote to the listeners.  Mm-hmm.  Because then we have to narrow it down to 20 for the big party. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  I know.  And if we have like 150 girls to choose from, it's just too much.  But now who's to say, Sabrina, that out of spite, if a girl commits Harry Caray and then  pulls out like the hottest of the hot chicks, you know what?  And I...  That would suck.  We have to be able to veto your pick.  Oh, yeah.  You guys have to have final say.  Veto power.  We need the veto power.  Because I think there's some girls out there that are a little bitter and they're going  to take one of the really hot girls with them.  Right.  You know how catty girls can be. 
[02:02:00]  Right.  All right.  Without saying like that we're agreeing to this or not.  No, I just...  I say we agreed that...  Really?  ...that Sabrina should be allowed to take a girl with her today.  So any girl that calls up and commits Harry Caray can then take a girl with them.  But we have veto power.  Yes.  We definitely have the veto power.  We could say no to your pick, Sabrina.  Is that fair?  That's fair.  Now, if we say no to her pick, does she get another one?  No.  Oh, that's...  Oh, okay.  I like it.  No.  So now she knows not to go too hot.  Right.  Or she misses her opportunity. 
[02:02:30]  Right.  I think...  And now how do we...  Or how are we going to determine whether we want to veto it or not?  It'll be obvious.  Will it be obvious?  We think alike.  Because some...  There's some bubble girls that I think are kind of hot.  We'll have to argue, you know, the pros and cons.  All right.  Sabrina, do you have a girl...  Without saying, do you have one already picked?  I have two of them picked.  Well, you only get one.  You only get one, and you can only mention one, because we don't...  A lot of people screaming numbers on the phones right now.  Had the vote or anything. 
[02:03:00]  All right.  Well, who, Sabrina, would you like to take with you?  Well, I really just...  Really dislike these silicone girls.  All right.  Hold on.  See, this is where...  I knew they were going this route.  No, you already mentioned her.  All right.  But don't say a number.  Okay.  Just tell us what's wrong with the girl before you say the number.  Just very, very phony.  Phony.  See?  They don't like the phony thing.  No, not just the boobs.  All of it. 
[02:03:30]  All of it.  Okay.  You know what?  We haven't kicked out a girl with breast implants yet.  No, we haven't.  This could be fun.  All right.  What else is wrong with her?  I think she's a little old to be in this contest.  A little old for the contest.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Give us a range of where she is.  On opandanthony.com.  Is it 1 through 20, 21 through 40?  Give us a page.  I think it's the last page.  All right.  Let me click on the last page, which is 101 and up to right now, 111. 
[02:04:00]  So it would end up in the middle there.  Wait.  Let me look.  You can't take her out?  Let me look.  Let me look.  All right.  She just got in the contest.  I think I know exactly who she's picking.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Does she have two pictures to choose from?  Yes.  Oh, no.  Okay.  All right.  We got to concentrate here. 
[02:04:30]  Can I see it on your screen?  Because you have the bigger computer screen.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Why don't you give the number of the girl you want to take with you, Sabrina?  She is number 109 from Las Vegas.  She just got in the contest.  She just got in the contest.  And she loves Norton.  But she is the girl that has the wiggly lure.  Yeah.  She's hanging from her body.  She's some kind of an adult star.  I saw a website of her with various toys. 
[02:05:00]  She works down at the Bunny Ranch.  And she had something hanging that I couldn't identify.  It almost looked like an aorta.  It looked like one of those big veins you pull out of a piece of meat that makes you throw the whole steak away.  You know?  Sometimes you're cutting.  You're like, oh, I don't want to be reminded there's that blood pumping through it.  A piece of gristle.  Gristle.  You know what, though?  If Jim Norton was here, though, he would yell and scream because he loves that.  I know.  He'd be so pissed.  He loves that. 
[02:05:30]  Well, Anthony, doesn't it look like the way she's holding her breast, it looks like she's trying to hold two bowling balls to bring back to the ball return?  It's like at any moment they could just topple out of her arms.  She's holding her top, and it looks like she's trying to hold mercury.  Yeah, it's ready to just pour out of between the fingers and stuff.  But let me tell you something.  It looks to me like they had to crop the second shot because you might have seen a little too much real estate.  Look at shot number two.  Oh, look where it's cropped.  You see her kneecaps and her waist. 
[02:06:00]  The girls from the ranch, not shy.  No.  Well, you know what?  I'm in agreement with Sabrina.  I'm going to have to go with her, too, on this one.  She had valid reasons why she should be kicked out, even though she had just gotten on the contest today.  I can't breathe.  He's laughing so hard.  Sabrina, I think you came up with a great new ruling.  Get out!  It gives the unhot chick some incentive to commit Harry Carey.  Why not?  A little reward and a little vengeance. 
[02:06:30]  All right.  Contestant 109 is now out of the round contest.  Thanks to Sabrina, contestant number 29, who performed Harry Carey earlier in the show.  Did you guys get the little feedback about my website?  You got a website?  Uh-huh.  Go ahead.  Give it a plug.  It's www.ladysabrinaslove.com.  Are you kidding me?  No.  You have a website?  Yeah.  Don't say it like that.  Well, www.imnothot.com. 
[02:07:00]  Oh.  Oh, now that's cruel.  Lady Sabrina's love?  Uh-huh.  Lady Sabrina love?  Sabrina with an S.  Sabrina's.  Oh, Sabrina's love.  All right.  Let me pop that up.  Hey, there you are.  Let's see.  I do look better.  Let me look.  Let me look.  All right.  Let me go to the...  Yeah, because you're covering your face with your hair.  Where do I go for, like, a couple of free pictures?  You don't have, like, a little free gallery, Sabrina? 
[02:07:30]  There will be a member site up tomorrow morning with about 30 pictures in it.  But there's only members only right here.  Well, I can send you a link.  You can have it.  Now, Sabrina, what you got to do, we know this stuff.  You got to give your potential clients a little something.  You got to give them a few, like, thumbnails.  They're called samples.  Little samples, huh?  Yeah.  They check out the samples, like, ooh, I like this.  And then they join.  How many months gone were you in that second picture?  How many months along? 
[02:08:00]  Oh, now...  What?  That one...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, God.  Brian Regan says, never say that.  I'm sorry.  All right, Sabrina.  I just thought, I assumed.  Sabrina, you took a girl with you.  You got your plug in.  So, we're all set.  Okay?  Thanks, guys.  Good luck.  All right.  Thanks, Sabrina.  There you have it.  Contestant 109 is out of the guy.  Anthony...  She's in the woods in this one, walking past the log.  The woods exist in it.  Doesn't it look like that shot from the guy on horseback when he fell off his horse?  She's taking big foot. 
[02:08:30]  I'm teasing.  Looks like the start of a snuff film.  Just lop her head off on that log.  All right, Anthony, another girl committed to Harry Carey today.  That was Angie from Columbus.  Angie from Columbus.  It's only fair she should call the show and take a girl with her.  Take one with her.  And we'll do that, hopefully, next.  Rick is back from the hospital with the pictures of Tippi Tom getting his lap dance.  Ooh, can't wait to check out the pictures.  Well, I want to see the Tippi Tom picture.  Let me see what he's looking like these days.  And we're going to put these up on opianthony.com. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, my God.  You got to put these up immediately, Rick.  People really want to see the before.  You got the before picture, too?  Yeah.  He does.  He looks like some kind of character actor.  Let me see.  This is Tippi Tom.  In a movie or something.  That's him?  Look at this.  Isn't that ridiculous?  That's him?  That's Tom.  Can you see, Ben?  Ah, Tippi Tom.  Oh, what were you going to say?  Oh, he's not a bad-looking guy.  Ben was going to say, he's not a bad-looking guy. 
[02:09:30]  I'm a faggot.  I was a faggot from two years old.  Wow, that is weird.  Now, you don't like queers?  Is that what you're saying?  You don't die of AIDS!  Yeah, march those down to Scott so he can put those up.  Do they have to march, Hopi?  I don't know.  Is that march, stinky?  There he goes.  He's marching.  Before and after pictures of Tippi Tom.  I got the picture of the left hand.  Oh, Christ on a pony!  Oh, God. 
[02:10:00]  Look.  Ah!  Let me see.  Ah!  Oh, God damn!  Jesus Christ.  Looks like he's doing a proctology exam on the guy.  That never gets easy to look at.  Oh, boy.  If you ever need assurance that you're hetero, just look at these shots.  Oh, God!  Ah!  Stop it!  It's like we're doing bad shots at the bar.  Oh, God! 
[02:10:30]  Ben!  Right said Fred's on him.  There's one guy very happy in that picture.  Yeah.  That never gets easy.  All right.  Well, it was wonderful.  What a grand time we had.  It's just, you know what else is disturbing if you just, and it's very difficult to get past the whole thing you're looking at?  It's a goddamn hospital room. 
[02:11:00]  There's a man-on-man dance going on in a hospital room somewhere in Manhattan.  Oh, he's reaching out.  Is it a well-known hospital?  Yeah.  I'm not going to say a word.  Believe me, that's as far as I'm going.  But I'm just saying there's a goddamn dance, a man-on-man dance going on in a hospital room.  Wonderful.  All right.  We'll continue.  You want to do the list of the worst movies of all time, man? 
[02:11:30]  No, that just looks like somebody, it looks like a nurse, a male nurse is abusing one of the patients.  Look at this picture.  Look at this.  Take your medicine.  You're going to take this medicine.  You're going to take it early.  Get a good one.  Oh, my God.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Oh, really?  How about that?  All right, Dan.  Yes.  We've got to do the top worst movies, I guess, even if we just read the stupid list over. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, we'll just go through it.  Okay.  And in the meantime, it's the F.U. line.  Thanks for calling, and here's the Opin' Anthony F.U. line.  Yeah, this is Chris in Boston.  I want to give a big F.U. to John Henry Williams.  You f***ing idiot.  Are you kidding me?  Bring in Ted Williams to Arizona to freeze his head?  We're not going to have enough problems as it is with Babe Ruth and the Yankees kicking our ass.  But no, you're such an idiot and decides to, hey, we'll freeze his head with him instead.  Boston's got enough problems as it is.  They don't need you. 
[02:12:30]  They're just bad.  F.U.  And I hope you die.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Tony from Cleveland.  I'd like to send a big f*** to you, the bank's girlfriend.  I hope she likes her new job, Flabby.  No, that's the only girl I know that can f*** the way down the corporate ladder instead of the way up.  See you later, bitch.  Next message.  Yeah, this is a big F.U. to all you customers out there.  To get cabinet deliveries on a 100 degree day, you can't offer a f***ing glass of water.  You don't give a sip.  You all suck.  F*** you and that big guy in the office that we work for. 
[02:13:00]  You suck.  Next message.  I'd just like to say F.U. to my ex-girlfriend, Carrie, who broke up with me after seven years  and then decided that she wanted to date some guy that's more fudgier and worthless than me.  F.U., you bitch.  End of messages.  Let me lick that off.  You're hanging with the O.B. and Anthony show.  Wow, Scott Colombo's working fast today. 
[02:13:30]  He's doing great.  Lots of exes.  We're hitting the road right after the show.  We'll see you in Philly tomorrow.  Backstage at Ozzfest.  Broadcasting live.  And then Buffalo.  We'll see you Saturday.  T&A with O&A in Buffalo.  Oh, yeah.  A chance for us to get arrested.  Oh, my God.  All right.  A few things to try to do before we get out of here.  We've got a list of the top 50 worst movies of all time. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Also, Rick has to throw a girl out of the WOW contest.  Oh, yeah.  A little Jimmy Norton's supposed to kick someone out as well.  Hopefully, he'll get here before the end of the show.  And we want Angie to call back from Columbus.  She performed Harry Caray on herself, which means she gets a chance to kick a girl out of the WOW contest as well.  And any other ladies that qualified for the WOW contest, if you want to commit Harry Caray and take yourself out of the contest, please give us a call.  We'll respect that. 
[02:14:30]  Of course.  And then you can take a girl with you as well.  All right?  Rick, you ready?  Might as well get it over with.  Yeah, get Rick's over with.  We know who it's going to be.  Rick, because you've been gone a while.  Well, you've got to talk about the girl for a while.  Now, also, I've got to say this about Rick.  Point out her faults and then give us the number.  Yes?  I think, you know, I can't say, I can't change Rick's mind.  I wouldn't want to or try to or anything like that.  But all I'm saying is Rick's decision is based on something more personal than it is the girl. 
[02:15:00]  I think you could find a lot worse girls to kick out of the contest if you're picking who I think you're going to pick.  Might be a surprise.  Because if it's just the fact that you don't like somebody on a personal basis or the way it were.  You don't think that would be fair, then?  No, I don't care.  I'm just saying I don't care.  I could give a crap.  But you're saying I'm not basing it on her pictures or her potential in the contest. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  You're saying it's just because you don't like her.  Yeah, which is fine.  I don't care.  Whoever you pick, you pick.  That's fine by me.  I'm just thinking.  I don't feel good about that.  Really?  I think it should be based on how her pictures are.  Oh, I think it should, too.  I bet you some of these hot girls are real bitches if you talk to them for a while.  Probably.  Right, but it's my decision, so I get to pick what I want.  Well, all right, give us a little brief description.  Well, let's see. 
[02:16:00]  Should I start with hair color?  Sure.  All right.  She's one of the many blondes that are in the contest.  Just...  One of the many blondes that are in this contest.  She goes, ooh, hmm.  Wow, really going out on a limb.  Let's see what kind of...  Pop her up now.  What can we say about her facial features?  Help is definitely needed.  Well, you could say that about a few of the girls in the contest. 
[02:16:30]  Well, yeah, you could if you wanted to generalize like that and put her in a group.  Rick, just lists or faults, let's get it over with.  Lists or faults, bad boobs, bad body, bad face, stringy Joe Dirt hair.  Um...  What?  What?  Am I off the mark?  A little bit.  You know, it's not the bad boobs, bad body thing.  It's just blowing right by me when he goes to Joe Dirt hair.  That one got me.  Well, you know, the stringy dirtiness of it? 
[02:17:00]  Uh-huh.  I don't think her body's that bad.  I think there are girls in this contest that are a lot worse than the girls in the contest.  I think there are girls right now that are going,  oh, thank God he just doesn't like her because he'd have picked me.  Right, right.  But believe it, it's a combination of things.  All right.  You know.  All right, with that said...  With that said, it's not who you think it is.  What?  That's right.  See? 
[02:17:30]  He's a regular Tricky Ricky.  Wow.  Well, let me look at that.  Pull that up.  All right.  And you will see what I mean.  What number?  Let me go to this one.  Because the person that you think I wanted to kick out, sure, I wanted to kick her out.  I think she deserved it based on, you know, her being an ass wipe.  Holy cow.  But...  Rick, bravo.  But I decided, you know what?  I'd rather her go through the humiliation of getting a low vote total.  Oh, okay.  You know, and let the listeners decide that she's just... 
[02:18:00]  Well, all right.  With that said, Rick, the number of the contestant,  you're kicking out of the WOW Contest.  The one I am kicking out from the West Coast.  If you'll scroll to picture number 71, her name is Rachel.  From KXOA.  Sacramento taking a lot of casualties.  And KXOA, her face.  Oh, I get it.  There you go.  Little radio thing there, right?  All right.  Well, there she goes.  The Geddy Lee of the contest is out.  Well, I'll vote a Rick for flipping that. 
[02:18:30]  I thought he was going another direction.  No, what did it for me was that weird tattoo thing under her boobs.  Don't like it.  That and the hungry chick face.  Like she's sitting in a nest waiting for a worm to be set.  Well, she was the one that a lot of the people were saying looked like Larry Bird.  That too.  About three hours from now, she's going to be very surprised.  Sacramento can't even defend themselves right now.  They're on the time delay thing with our radio show.  Look at she, Glover.  Mad Max pulling a radio bit. 
[02:19:00]  All right.  Very good, though.  There you go.  I'll give you props on that.  Who saw that kind of a little surprise twist?  I think everyone picked a girl except for little Jimmy Norton.  Yeah.  And hopefully Angie will call back so she can take a girl with her.  And I want one more girl to perform Harry Carey before we get out of here, Ant.  Why is a girl calling up for us to critique her now?  See, this is Kristen.  Hello?  Hello.  What's up, Kristen?  What's up?  You tell me. 
[02:19:30]  Is this Opie or Anthony?  Oh, both of us.  You're on the air as we speak.  No, I just, you know, I don't want to take up too much of your time.  If you have a minute, I just wanted to know what you thought.  And if it's bad, I don't want to hear it because you'll hurt my feelings.  Wow.  That is a brave move.  You calling up and asking what we think.  Well, like I said, you know, if it's bad, then just let me off the hook easy and that'll be that.  Well, Kristen, what do you think?  You've seen a lot of the contestants.  You've seen your pictures. 
[02:20:00]  You tell us, what do you think?  How do you think you stack up in this?  Um, I don't know.  I think I do all right.  I don't think I'm going to win, but it's all in good fun.  And, you know, I know I'm not hideous.  Well, that's good.  That's a good thing to be.  Good, good.  You want to maybe perform Harry Caray and take a girl with you?  Oh, no.  I'm going to hang in there.  Hmm.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Well, okay.  You're flashing. 
[02:20:30]  So I see you did the traditional wow thing.  Uh-huh.  In both pictures, you're pulling your shirt up.  Uh-huh.  And showing your boobage.  Uh-huh.  There you go.  So I'm looking at that picture.  Now I got the second one.  Well, you know, I'd like to tell you guys real quick that, you know, it's real hard to be  sexy under a fluorescent light against a dirty wall.  I know.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  But whatever.  Yeah, well, it worked for some girls.  Well, yeah.  So you're saying it's the lighting.  No, no, no.  I'm not saying anything. 
[02:21:00]  I'm just saying it's, you know.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, what kind of panties are you wearing in that shot?  Uh, I think maybe a pink thong.  Is it a thong?  Uh-huh.  It almost looks like briefs.  No, no.  I don't wear briefs.  But you wear them up pretty high because I'm looking and it's about two inches below your  belly button.  Huh.  Kristen, I'm going to make believe we're, um, we lost the connection, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  You took her advice. 
[02:21:30]  Right.  She said, if it's not going to be good, don't say it.  You'll hurt a feeling.  So you just made believe you lost the connection.  Oops.  We lost the connection on Kristen.  Hopefully, you can call back so we can continue our discussion.  That spoke volumes.  Oh, man.  You know what?  She's not that bad.  No, no.  Let me tell you something, though.  She is contestant 107, right?  Yeah.  So she got in pretty recent, right?  Yeah.  Like a half hour ago.  Yeah. 
[02:22:00]  That was a really stupid move of her.  She probably would have skated under the radar screen.  Now everyone is kind of staring at her.  Everyone is looking going, oh, dude, now if I have to throw someone out, you know, maybe  you shouldn't draw attention unless you're Parker or Carrie.  Well, are we going to get to this list?  Probably not because then we just got to list the top movies without discussing this.  Yeah.  We got to discuss it because I got some things that I don't agree with.  You know what? 
[02:22:30]  We probably will have some downtime tomorrow backstage at OzFest.  We could do this tomorrow.  Yeah.  Well, in the beginning, you know how it is.  Why are you laughing, Ben?  Downtime?  A little bit.  It does happen at the beginning.  Yeah.  You know.  You're just hanging out.  You set your stuff up.  You sit down.  And, you know, all of a sudden, no one's around.  And we'll, I don't know, we'll break this out, I guess.  Yeah.  All right.  Let me get back up stuff.  Oh, we got to say goodbye to stripper guy?  Where's stripper guy from Hunktasia? 
[02:23:00]  Sean, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, guys, I wanted to congratulate you on being politically correct  and allowing Down syndrome contestants in this wild contest.  Yeah.  Take a look at number 68.  She's out of the contest.  She's out.  She is.  Oh, she had eyes like that lion from Doctority.  I was scared.  I kicked her out about a half hour ago.  I was taking a leak.  Lion from Doctority reference.  Wow.  You guys suck.  All right, bye.  She's out, though.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, she is indeed out.  Andy?  Danny.  Danny?  Rob from Jersey wants to know, does the lighting make her stupid, too?  All right.  How you doing, man?  Good.  You did a great job over there.  I saw some of the pictures of you and Tippi Tom in that hospital room that Tom is in,  giving him a little dance.  Oh, yeah.  So now, apparently, you do this for a living.  Yes.  Yeah.  You, uh...  We just started our own company, actually.  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[02:24:00]  Which I got to head to, like, right now, so I just wanted to come in and thank you.  He's a big fan of the show, eh?  Oh, yeah.  You entertain a lot of the girls?  Oh, yeah.  You get a lot of bachelorette parties?  Oh, yeah.  And what's with these breakup parties girls are having?  Oh, yeah.  They have them.  They break up with their boyfriends and all their girlfriends take them out, and you get  to shake your junk in front of their face.  Sometimes a little more.  Sometimes a little more.  God, the girls got to know.  So you rents a girl?  Like that?  I'm not gay, man.  No, look.  Hey, I'm not gay, man.  Straighter than straight.  We just didn't know how to ask you. 
[02:24:30]  And that sounds like...  It looks like you could kick our ass.  How do you ask?  And he gets into a line of work where his job now is to titillate women up on stage and  just, like, kind of shake your stuff.  But I hear a lot of the guys that do what you do are gay.  Our $3 bills, yeah.  They are, huh?  None of my guys are, no.  No.  We're all men.  All men.  So the joke's on everyone.  Just putting on a show.  Yeah.  Cool.  Performing, putting on a show.  So you weren't happy that you had to do that Tippi Thompson?  No.  Hi, Jesus.  I just wanted to meet you guys and get our name out there.  It's like, no, I'm not happy and all my friends are listening, so make sure I tell everybody 
[02:25:00]  that stunk.  I hated it.  Tom was happy.  Did you see him?  Oh, yeah.  The guy's down on, you know, he's down in the dumps and you made him happy.  Speaking of dumps, I heard it really stunk.  It stunk.  Really?  The room stunk?  Oh, yeah.  Kicked.  Like crap?  What did it smell like?  It smelled like Tom.  Like Tippi Tom.  It smelled like Tom.  No matter how clean they tried to get him, there's still a stench.  The stink is stuck to him.  Jeez. 
[02:25:30]  Wow.  God bless you.  Look at that.  See, you got to take the bed with the good.  Oh, yeah.  When those girls are shoving money down the front of your, whatever they call it.  Sometimes they take everything off on you.  Do they?  Yeah.  Oh, I hate when that happens.  Females are worse than guys.  Do you do that move?  We've talked about that on the show, that the females are worse than guys.  Yeah, they're really bad.  I've seen it at a lot of go-go bars and there's nothing.  Do you do that move where you shake back and forth real quick and your junk flops in their face?  That's nasty.  That's nasty. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  And they're all, woo!  Woo!  Yeah, we got a bad rap with the strip clubs.  We go in and there's bikers and bouncers around making sure we don't even touch.  You know, you got to put your hands to your side no matter what the girl is doing.  And the girls go in there and they're pretty much, you know, hey, let me give that a tug.  They do whatever they want.  You're pretty much in, when you do the mail reviews, you're in control of the whole situation.  Yeah.  But private parties, you never know what you're up against. 
[02:26:30]  What about when just some slob is coming up to you?  You got to smile and yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That's great.  The fat bridesmaid.  The big pig bridesmaid is coming up here.  The mother's there.  You can't touch the girl that's getting married because the mother's going to get up mad.  So it's like you got to put girls from the back.  Just batch her eyes shut.  Batch the mom's eyes shut.  Get out of the room, dude.  There's a little Elmers for you.  You know, he looks like Jeff Norris after Stacker 2.  Are you saying Jeff is a little?  No, Jeff doesn't have an ounce of fat on him, but he's a much bigger guy. 
[02:27:00]  Doesn't he look like Jeff Norris?  Thinner?  He's a big guy.  That's what it is.  Very muscle bound.  You know.  I wish Norton was here to see this.  I know.  I like Norton.  He could hate his body even more.  Yeah, he would.  All right.  We should let you go.  Yes.  So what's the phone number again?  It's Hunktasia?  Hunktasia.  Hunktasia.  It's 973 area code 9830968.  All right.  Cool.  There you go, ladies.  I just need a picture with you. 
[02:27:30]  Is that all right?  No problem.  I'll never see you again.  That's not true.  Come back whenever you want.  Sure.  Now that we know you're not gay, no problem.  Anytime.  No way.  Anytime we need a male dancer.  And say hi to Psycho Mark for us.  Okay.  There we go.  Taking a picture.  There we go.  Oh, there it is.  Victoria, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Victoria, what's going on?  I'm sorry.  I'm on a really crappy phone, but don't hang up on me.  All right.  Go ahead.  Well, I have two things, actually. 
[02:28:00]  Yeah.  You're not going to do the footloose.  Or not the footloose.  I was going to say footloose has got to be on the 50 worst movie list.  Yeah.  Of all time?  Of all time.  Let me look real fast.  Go ahead.  Keep talking as I look.  But the other thing was, I would love to be in the wow contest, but I have really no boobs.  But I'm really cute.  Stay home.  Aw.  Now, you know something?  Small boobs aren't bad.  But she said she had no boobs.  Well, they weren't lopped off in an accident or anything. 
[02:28:30]  I mean, they're just really...  If they were, we'd want you to come down and see that.  Right.  What size are they?  A's.  They're small.  You got little A's.  But they're perky.  Yeah.  And I have a cute body.  I'm like small and...  See, if they're proportioned to your body and you're a small girl...  There's nothing wrong with small boobs.  Nothing at all.  If you think they're cute and perky, come on down.  You said you had no boobs.  I've seen the girls that have completely flat and just a, you know what, you know, point  right, poking out. 
[02:29:00]  Like a rivet.  Oh, well.  I'm a little bit...  I'm better than that.  But I'm cute.  I'm cute, though.  Then come on down and get your pictures taken, all right?  Oh, it's great to talk to you guys.  It's hard for me to get on the air, but...  Very difficult.  And Footloose did not make the list of the 50 worst movies of all time.  I'd have put it in there.  Yeah.  Oh, definitely.  You know it.  All right, Victoria.  Thank you.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  All right.  Yeah.  You know the guy that filmed the black kid getting slammed into the police car?  Got arrested.  Got arrested. 
[02:29:30]  They're showing it all over Fox.  Do we know why?  What a great story.  No, it says the man who shot the amateur video of Inglewood police beating a black teenager  was taken into custody Thursday afternoon by officials with the Los Angeles County DA's office.  Michael Crooks arrested outside CNN's Los Angeles bureau where he was scheduled for an interview.  So he's scheduled for this interview.  They're waiting for him.  They grab him, cuff him, and it says witnesses said he was screaming as he was driven away 
[02:30:00]  by plainclothes officers.  Crooks said, authorities said Crooks was taken to the grand jury investigation of the beating  case where he failed to appear Thursday morning as scheduled.  Authorities said he was arrested on something unrelated to that case.  You know damn well.  This guy had a warrant out for his arrest.  Here we go.  He gets his picture all over CNN.  They looked everywhere to see what this guy did and what they could nab him on because  he effed with the cops, you know, videotaping a cop slamming a black kid's head in the trunk 
[02:30:30]  and then punching him in the face.  And if you're going to do something like this, you've got to be prepared because there are  consequences out there.  Regardless of...  So...  So...  So...  Thank you.
