<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opens with crude sexual banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  The conversation quickly shifts to Opie's infrequent mail retrieval, his feud with his building's doorman, and the resulting consequences, including his cell phone being shut off twice. This leads to a reflection on the differences between the anticipation of receiving letters versus the immediacy of modern texting, with Opie sharing a nostalgic anecdote about a long-distance girlfriend and the scent of her perfume on their letters.  He then unexpectedly details his initially negative experiences with female anatomy. The discussion further meanders through Opie's unusual sleeping habits (12-hour sleeps), his dreams involving guns and rape (clarified as occurring only while lucid dreaming), and the connection between work anxieties and dreams. This surprisingly transitions into a discussion on gun control, with Opie expressing strong Second Amendment support.

A substantial portion is dedicated to a scathing and highly offensive critique of Mika Brzezinski,  featuring repeated use of vulgar language to describe her appearance and performance on *Morning Joe*.  The hosts discuss a recent on-air argument between Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough about Obama's White House diversity, expanding into a debate on affirmative action and its potential downsides. Opie shares a personal anecdote about possibly losing a radio job due to affirmative action.  The verbal assault on Brzezinski continues, culminating in speculation about the future of *Morning Joe*. The segment concludes with discussion of Opie's ex-girlfriend appearing in Lincoln commercials and the hosts' cynical observations on female paranoia in relationships, repeatedly using the phrase "it's the bitches that are bitches".

The show moves on to a discussion of a reconciled relationship with radio personality Jay Thomas, following a conversation with Jay's brother about a colleague's ("Bobo's") on-air behavior.  This is followed by a humorous anecdote about one host's son climbing a lifeguard stand, sparking an idea for a viral kitten video.  The conversation circles back to gun control, fueled by a recent school shooting and a Fox News debate, with the hosts expressing exhaustion with the topic.  Numerous tangents ensue: Bob Kelly's impending fatherhood (including a humorous anecdote about a previous stillborn child), a critique of a Justin Timberlake video, and an extended discussion on the hosts' coping mechanisms for dealing with the emotionally taxing gun control debate.  Their obsession with the game Flow is also mentioned, along with a contentious interaction with a Quentin Tarantino interview clip where he refuses to address the link between violence in his films and real-life violence.  Studio guest Drew Boogie joins the latter part of the broadcast, and the hosts discuss the contrasting work environments of their show and other SiriusXM programs.

The next segment begins with a discussion of Quentin Tarantino and the hosts' approach to interviewing celebrities by bringing up potentially controversial past events. They vehemently reject any responsibility for the impact of their work beyond entertainment, referencing Reverend Al Sharpton's role in firing Don Imus and their own past controversies. The conversation then pivots to a Justin Timberlake video, followed by a brief, suggestive interaction with a Comic-Con attendee. Andrew Dice Clay calls in, sharing an anecdote about a female comedian he found unfunny, using highly offensive language to describe her.  The hosts then discuss the Academy Awards, employing vulgar descriptions and derogatory comments about Helen Hunt. A discussion of a previous call from Bobo highlights the contrast between his demeanor on their show and his upbeat performance on Sam Roberts' show.  This leads to a humorous segment about age and the passage of time, interspersed with off-color remarks and Bobo’s opinions on the *Argo* and *Les Misérables* Oscar nominations, including comments about Anne Hathaway. The hosts speculate on how Bobo’s material plays differently on the main show versus the after-show. The segment ends with the hosts’ long-standing frustration at never being sent to cover the Super Bowl, followed by airing a sexually explicit CB radio conversation between Jim Norton and Anthony Cumia, and a vulgarly-described bathroom encounter with an unidentified man. They end by promising to investigate their Super Bowl snub.


The show continues with guessing a guest, revealing it to be Ken Linder, a self-help author and psychologist from the *Today* Show.  Their discussion focuses on his lack of eyebrows.  Bob Kelly joins in the studio, discussing upcoming performances and the challenges of different show times and audiences. The conversation turns to a humorous anecdote about their previous radio show, N.E.W., and their view into a nearby apartment building, leading to an extended, sexually explicit discussion about female anatomy based on observations from their various studio windows. Opie discusses his upcoming fatherhood, expressing anxieties and detailing the overwhelming experience of baby product shopping at Babies "R" Us, with humorous exaggerations and vulgar asides.  Drew Boogie’s song "I'm in Chains" plays during a break.  Brief mentions are made of upcoming guests David Duchovny and Alan Alda (mistakenly mentioned as having AIDS). The conversation with David Duchovny covers his age, acting career, experiences with firearms and professional wrestling, and the pros and cons of social media.

The conversation with David Duchovny focuses on his new movie "The Phantom," anxieties about subway incidents in New York City, emotional reactions to surprising events (like "Move That Bus"), guns, and self-defense.  Bob Kelly joins, discussing his stand-up, podcast, and experiences on "Move That Bus." The conversation then shifts to Google Glass and a new smartwatch, experiences with altered states of consciousness, and the impact of movies seen while under the influence. DJ Who Kid and Patty Stanger (from "Millionaire Matchmaker") join the conversation. The latter half focuses heavily on Stanger, discussing her show, dating advice, using offensive language while discussing various demographics and their dating habits. Sponsors, including Stephen Singer Jewelers and a weight-loss product, are mentioned.  The segment ends with promotion for Kelly's stand-up and podcast.

Patty Stanger, the millionaire matchmaker, discusses her book and DVD, her clientele (primarily billionaires), and experiences working with people of different economic backgrounds.  A significant portion details her negative experience with a former assistant, Chelsea, who allegedly stole from her after meeting a drug-dealing boyfriend through Stanger, using highly offensive language to describe her.  The conversation shifts to Stanger's dating life, including relationships with a millionaire who investigated her finances and Tamara Mellon, using vulgar and racially charged language when describing Mellon. She discusses a brief relationship with another Patti Stanger, mentioning that financial investigation preceded a sexual encounter.  Stanger expresses admiration for David Letterman and attempts to contact a writer for his show. The segment concludes with numerous instances of offensive language, including racial slurs and sexually explicit descriptions, further discussion of her personal life and business, and interactions with the hosts.  The hosts promote Stanger's appearances on other shows and Bob Kelly's stand-up shows. The final moments include a live read for a sexual enhancement product and further banter.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shh! All aboard! All aboard for the Opie and Anthony show!  Never before has one radio show been so extreme...  It's gonna melt your mind.  So vulgar...  Shut up, you fucking degenerate hippie cocksucker!  I would take a shot in the face for a minute.  Very small cock.  So...  Flecholent. 
[00:00:30]  I've a fire farted three times since I've been here.  I'm like, alright, the Opie and Anthony show.  Here we are.  Another four hours of love.  The jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  This is good practice when I do The View.  Quite simply.  The greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest that ever existed.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn the crowd. 
[00:01:00]  Don't do it.  I can't take it every time I'm on the show.  It's just cocked.  Wow!  With Opie, the destroyer.  You're a bigger douchebag.  You're a big douchebag.  That's what I do now.  Anthony, the rage.  Yeah, yeah.  Your guy had a corner on the peanut.  We understand.  I'll give it to your guy on the peanut.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  This is why I can't even take fingers in my ass, because it makes me feel like I have  to shit.  All kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful, but I just can't take them. 
[00:01:30]  The Opie Anthony Show.  Strap in.  Strap the fuck in.  This one's gonna hurt.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, let's do that.  Good morning, everybody.  Hi there.  Friday, January 11th, 2013.  2013 already?  2013.  I made a stupid mistake.  What?  I know it's hack, but I just gotta say it. 
[00:02:00]  I was doing my bills, because I still like to do my bills old school.  I don't do that online banking.  What?  With a pen and paper?  Not much.  I do a little online banking, but I kind of like to write those checks out.  Really?  Yeah, I get a feel for what the hell's going on.  That's interesting.  I'm just lazy.  I need to call my bank lady and get it all fucking squared away.  It's so much easier to just, like, four months will pass, and I'll be like, do I have that on automatic paying?  I sure hope so.  I'm gonna be shutting my lights off. 
[00:02:30]  And then I realize, yeah, I don't even, like, I don't even think of LIPA anymore.  It's just, ah, it comes out of my account.  You're right.  It would save me a lot of time.  Yeah.  And my bills wouldn't be late, because I only check my mail once every, I check my mail, and I'm being honest, twice a month.  Yeah?  That's it.  Wow.  Twice a month I check my mail.  We're blind to their tyranny.  You should put a bucket on the mailman's head.  Uh, Seinfeld?  Very good.  Nine out of ten times it's gonna be Seinfeld. 
[00:03:00]  Of course it is.  I'm good at that shit.  No, I check my mail only twice a month, because I learned, I don't know, a few years back, that, uh, most of the time it's just shit.  Yeah.  So why would I check it every day?  That's true.  So I check it about twice a month, and it's a huge stack, and my building gets mad, because they have to, like, they gotta store it somewhere else with the big rubber bands and stuff.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because I live in New York, you get the tiny little box.  That makes it even worse. 
[00:03:30]  So how do they know that, like...  The mailman...  Oh, the mailman goes, hey, this motherfucker's like...  Yeah, they go to the door guy, or whatever, the guy behind the desk, and they go, ugh, once again, we can't fit any more mail into this box.  And then they take my mail out, they fucking, you know, wrap it up, and when they see me, they give it to me.  You should say, yeah, that tip I give you for Christmas, this is what it's for.  But the guy doesn't see me, because I sneak in the building every day, because I don't want to deal with that shit.  Ow.  I don't like it.  So how often do you...  Like, I pay...  I know I'm all over the place, but it'll come together. 
[00:04:00]  I pay $2,600 a month so they can open a door for me to walk in and out of my building.  You should bring the mail up.  And then...  But I don't want anyone opening a stupid door for me and having a dumb conversation about who gives a fuck.  And then there's a guy behind the desk, or a lady, and they all want to say hi, and they want to have chit-chat about me and my wife and the kids.  I'm like, who are you?  Oh, you're too important to talk to the doorman, huh?  Yes.  Too important to talk to the doorman. 
[00:04:30]  All right.  You live in a house, right?  I don't.  You live in a house.  Yeah.  Imagine every time you want to just go into your house, you have someone greeting you, opening your front door.  Uh-huh.  But it's not just opening the front door.  They feel like they have to have a little something-something with you.  A conversation.  And it usually means stopping as you're trying to get into the door.  You have to stop every day.  Sometimes it's only like 30 seconds, sure.  Doesn't matter.  But every single time you go in.  And then, as soon as you get into your foyer, there's going to be a guy or a girl behind a desk wanting to chit-chat as well. 
[00:05:00]  And then, finally, you can get to the elevator and go up to your apartment.  That sounds fucking terrible.  It does, right?  Most people would be like, oh, that sounds kind of cool.  You know, when I first moved into a building in New York City, it was cool.  I'm like, this is kind of cool.  I feel like I live in a really nice hotel or something.  You're living in a drama.  Right.  Like a TV show.  Hey, there's one of the characters.  It was cool.  But after a while, it wears you down. 
[00:05:30]  So now there's other ways into my building where you don't see anybody.  And that's what I do.  You sneak in.  Yeah.  And then my mail, I check it, you know, about twice a month.  Twice a month?  I'm not joking.  I thought you maybe meant a week or...  I said twice a month.  Twice a month.  And that's not an exaggeration.  Wow.  And that's why my cell phone bill, my cell phone has been shut off twice in the last  four months.  Oh, has it?  Yeah, because I got to, like, time the checking of the mail for when the bills come in. 
[00:06:00]  You know what?  That's probably the easiest thing to set up automatic payment on.  I think you could do it right through the settings on your phone.  I've done it.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  But actually, I haven't set it up for them to do it every month, because I think my last  two cell phone bills were late.  And I had to do that whole fucking thing.  And then there was an option.  Yeah.  Obviously, there's an issue with me and my cell phone bill.  There's an option.  There was an option to keep that going.  And I said, no.  Why?  Because I'm an idiot.  I think you know that by now.  You could just...  My brain works in mysterious ways. 
[00:06:30]  That's hilarious.  And the mail, it's all just bills, or it's this and that, or people asking for money,  or junk mail.  So I don't check it anymore.  When we were growing up, the mail was kind of cool.  Very exciting, going out to the mailbox when it was for you.  Especially if you sent away for something.  Oh, please.  Now these kids, they send away for something.  It comes, what?  It comes in the mail two hours later?  I don't know how they figure that out.  If the order was placed before 4 p.m. today, you will get it delivered... 
[00:07:00]  Before you go to sleep tomorrow.  Yeah.  Not even.  It's not even tomorrow anymore.  It's creepy.  It's fucking...  It really is amazing.  We used to, like...  I had a long-distance girlfriend, and back in way, way long time ago, we would exchange...  Had to be the 80s.  Exchange those love letters.  Yeah.  Oh.  The opster was romantic.  Oh, boy.  What I fucking would give to read some of those.  Well, I had hers for a while.  I think I threw them away.  Oh, not those.  I know. 
[00:07:30]  I know she has them.  Oh.  I've looked her up a couple times on the old internet, and she's underground.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She hasn't popped her head up.  Because I do want to just say hi.  Maybe she listens every day.  I don't fucking know.  Rock.  And I would love those letters.  Brother man.  Brother man.  I love you.  But the point...  You know, you wrote that letter, and she got it maybe three, four days later.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Right.  Nowadays, with this internet and the texting, you don't have to fucking... 
[00:08:00]  Your love letters are on the phone every day.  Instantaneous.  Instantaneous.  Yes.  So...  Sometimes, uh...  But...  Sometimes, uh...  The butterflies every day check in the mail, going, oh, did she write?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Did she write?  Is the letter coming back today?  Open that up.  Do that little hunch over.  Meh.  Look inside.  Right.  Oh, nothing.  God.  Funk.  And I would slam the door shut.  Oh, man.  Then I would go back to the house all depressed.  Oh.  But sometimes, I'd open up that mailbox, and I would smell that perfume.  What? 
[00:08:30]  She perfumed him?  A little bit.  A little bit.  Well...  A little bit.  Wow.  I think she might have rubbed it on her...  Whoa.  A little bit.  Now, that would be pretty fucking hot.  I don't think she did.  It's something you can't do with sex.  Oh, no.  I know she did it.  Sexed.  Know why?  I know she did it.  Why?  Same girl with the fingers.  Oh, then you would have...  I would have known.  The mailman would have fucking complained.  I don't know what you're...  What are you, a fish of the month club?  But you're going to...  She...  Yeah, that is...  Yes, yes, it's true.  The first...  One of the first vaginas the Opster had smelled really, really bad. 
[00:09:00]  First vaginas.  And it kind of threw me off a little bit there.  A little bit.  That's...  I'm glad you came back.  I came back strong, but...  That would have been terrible if it turned you off.  No, I was scared to do certain things because of...  Oh.  Venturing further past the equator.  I was scared for a little bit there.  Yeah.  And then I realized, you know...  She was an anomaly.  Yeah, that not all girls smelled like that.  Like, really, really bad.  Wow.  Yeah.  So where were we? 
[00:09:30]  Doorman?  Mail?  Yeah.  The mail.  I do get a lot of mail.  I'll fucking a lot of mail.  Most of it junk mail.  Because I do...  I've gone paperless with most of my bills.  There are a few that I still have.  And then they get lost in the giant pile of old mail and stuff.  Right.  But I know that I have to pay it.  So I wind up punching it up online and then throwing, like, three months worth of money  of what it would have been at it.  There you go.  So I'm like, click, send. 
[00:10:00]  That should be good for a while.  Oh, that's smart.  Yeah.  Then you're like, I'll wait for the next bill.  That's really smart.  Why do we bring this up?  Um, let's see.  Where did we start with this?  Building.  Mail.  Where do we start with this?  Um.  Uh.  Uh.  What was the initial thought?  Uh.  Oh, shit.  Iraq was fat?  Iraq.  Must have started that way.  Iraq?  Are you listening today?  Comment?  Yeah.  I'm just remembering you bitching that the doorman talks to.  Oh!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa! 
[00:10:30]  Don't laugh on this kid.  Opie's bitching about the mail or something.  No, but I brought a whole bunch of things together to get back to this place.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you promised it would all come together.  And it did, right?  Doorman and mail, smelly pussy.  Let's see.  It didn't really come together.  No, there was stuff before.  It's very entertaining, though.  I'm trying to see if somebody knows here, but I guess not.  Oh, well.  I'll go back and do it.  We were going somewhere.  Yeah, go listen to the beginning of this show.  Holy fuck!  Usually we bring it back together all nice and tie a little bow around this whole fucking thing. 
[00:11:00]  It wasn't just paying the bills?  I don't think so.  Check your mail.  Check your...  Holy fuck, what was it?  The building.  The...  Started off the show, said hi.  Yeah.  You announced the date.  I remember you announced the date at the top.  Oh, my God.  You want to just hear the start of the show?  No, I really don't.  A few people have said it's...  Opie collects his mail every two months, but...  No, no.  Twice a month.  Oh, I know.  Twice a month.  Twice a month.  Oh.  Ant was surprised it was 2013.  Oh!  You started talking to it, right?  Yes. 
[00:11:30]  Yes.  I just need to bring it together.  Sam Roberts.  Sam Roberts.  And trust me, it's not going to make a worst of the week countdown or anything.  All I wanted to say, but it took 15 minutes to get there, 10 minutes to get there, was  I made the dumb mistake of doing 2012.  Ah.  Paying a bill.  Right.  What does that mean?  I don't think they...  And I knew I made the mistake, but I already fucking sealed the envelope, and I fucking  hate taking that steak knife to the envelope.  Oh, and you've got to open it up.  And then taping it all up because it's the special envelope they give you at the window.  Oh, it looks like fucking Sonny Corleone after the toll booth. 
[00:12:00]  That fucking...  That envelope, it's the hardest thing, because you'd think you could do it.  It's like, I just sealed it.  Right.  That glue is a miracle.  It really is.  But I know I sent off a bill with a 2012.  Yeah.  I think they open it, and they see and go, ah, and they just scratch that.  Just go fuck it.  Well, that's illegal.  If they do that to my fucking check, there's going to be hell to pay.  Well, when it comes back, you'll see and be like, I didn't do that, and then they'll  just shut your power off and say, go fuck us and find another power company.  Ah, man.  They win all the time. 
[00:12:30]  That's all it was, but there was a little off-roading there.  Yeah.  How was everyone's night?  Man, what a fucking evening I've had.  You did?  Yeah.  Way better than talking about the mail, hopefully.  No.  Well, we're in deep trouble with this fucking radio show.  Not really.  I got home yesterday at about 11 and change a.m. in the morning.  Can I guess?  Yeah.  You slept until 8 o'clock. 
[00:13:00]  Well, that's true, but I continued on.  What?  I swear to you, dude.  Wait, you got home at around 11 and you slept?  11.  I fell asleep about an hour later, so I fell asleep at about noon.  Right.  Noon yesterday.  So you've been up for a couple days before this.  I've had a pretty good week.  A pretty good run?  Yeah.  I had red-eye.  I taped the other day, so I'm in the city.  I usually go out, stay up a little, go to the McHale's next to my building and fucking,  you know, have a little fun there, a few Guinness, things like that. 
[00:13:30]  So yesterday, absolutely nothing to do.  Going home, not staying in the city.  Went home, fell asleep a little afternoon and slept until 6.  Huh?  No, no, no.  I went with 8 first.  Not that bad, but kind of close because of what, like, I woke up and then went back  to sleep.  Right.  It was, it was, uh, uh, 11.45 P. I woke up.  You, you were sleeping off and off for 12 hours?  No, completely asleep.  Holy fuck. 
[00:14:00]  Like, I didn't wake up for anything.  I was on the couch.  I woke up and I'm like, what the fuck is here?  I look and I saw 11.45 and I knew it was, you know, because it was dark out.  It wasn't daytime.  And I'm like, holy shit.  So I got up and, uh, I was back and I was in bed and back asleep by about 2 a.m.  Wow.  And, and slept right up until I had to get up.  Wow.  So I had a window of consciousness.  Wow. 
[00:14:30]  Of two hours.  It was great.  I had cool dreams.  I'm so jealous of that.  It rolled.  I couldn't tell you the last time I went to sleep and, uh, stayed asleep for seven straight  hours.  It was so good.  Oh, did it roll.  I woke up and I was able to just lay, like I'm on the couch.  So when I woke up, I didn't have to jump up to be somewhere.  Right.  So I just kind of basked in my sleepiness and let that, let that dream kind of congeal in  my head.  Right.  Cause you know, if you got to jump out of bed, you forget your dreams.  So I remember like all these little details of the dream and stuff. 
[00:15:00]  It was just a weird one.  Of course.  It entails many times guns and rape, uh, you know, were you raping in your dream fun?  No, I didn't get any rape cause I didn't know I was dreaming.  I only, I only rape in a dream when I know it's a dream, which is rare, which is very rare.  But when I know I'm dreaming, Oh, someone's getting raped.  You know what?  You make a good point.  And we've brought it up a few times on the show.  If our dreams could tell us we're dreaming, then it would be so much more fun.  Oh, cause then you could just do what you want.  You know, you're not going to get arrested and all that shit, that anxiety, you feel 
[00:15:30]  like, Holy fuck.  I mean, you're thinking, your mind's thinking this is real and you're in deep shit and then  you open up your eyes for the day and realize, Oh fuck, it was a dream.  And then, then you have that, ah, feeling that comes over, but it's somewhere in your  fucking head.  They could, uh, some, something could go off and go, what you're seeing and doing right  now is make believe.  Yeah.  That would be a lot of fun.  It would be fun to be able to do that.  But I kind of like that other don't know aspect of it.  Why?  Cause when you wake up, it's really, um, a little treat. 
[00:16:00]  It's a treat that you're not in trouble.  And it's kind of like a, like, Whoa, what happened there?  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Like, but if you know you're dreaming, it's fun cause you can do whatever you want.  I eat rape and fly and fly flying, right?  I have too many morals in my dreams.  Really?  That's why I would love to know I was fucking dreaming.  Yeah.  Okay.  I can see that.  I hold back from some of that, some of that, uh, dream sex.  But when you know you're dreaming, then you could just go fucking wild. 
[00:16:30]  That's what I'm saying.  That's where it would, would, would be a plus.  But it's rare that it happens.  So it's special.  I'd like to keep it special.  Yeah.  Last night I didn't know I was dreaming.  And of course I had a, uh, a sidearm.  I had to use my gun.  Uh, somebody was in my house.  Do you, do you sleep with your fucking gun?  Not on my hip.  Oh, I know you don't want to talk about that shit.  Not on my hip.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  That would be a little weird.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So all of a sudden, maybe, all right.  Let's just put it this way.  It's within reach.  Okay.  You know, it's within reach.  Um, but I had my desert eagle on me in my house, which I don't carry that. 
[00:17:00]  It's a big, heavy gun.  It's very impractical.  How heavy is that?  It's a, it weighs like a couple of pounds.  It's very heavy to shoot.  I think every American should have a desert eagle.  I think so too.  I really do.  I think so too.  I'm all for the fucking second amendment, man.  For every, every single human being should have a, not only a gun, a desert eagle for  every, and that's, what's going to thwart.  Yes.  These shootings, a giant 50 caliber round.  I am so fucking sick of people talking about gun control.  It's the big, uh, big hot button issue right now.  I'm fucking sick of it.  But I, I had my desert eagle and there was someone in the house and I had to use it and 
[00:17:30]  I looked and, and the slide mechanism, something was fucked up.  It was like a piece was upside down and now I'm there taking the gun apart and I'm in  a corner and I hear like someone and I'm trying to put it back together.  I'm like, why the hell is this like this?  That's when you know that there's a problem.  Like you never, you usually get stressed out about what's really going on in your life  and your dreams or what used to be or whatever, whether it's, you know, school or your  job.  Yeah.  You're now having dreams where your gun doesn't work. 
[00:18:00]  My gun doesn't work.  But that is the, been a dream of mine for, for many is even as a child, but when I had  a gun, it would like, I'd pull the trigger and it would crack or the bullet, the bullet  was like too big or too small.  It would fall out of the barrel.  The guns never work in dreams.  But basically what you're, you're describing something that everyone goes through depending  on what they do for a living or depending what their hobby is.  You had radio dreams.  You had those.  A million of them.  Not there in time to change the record.  Yeah.  I mean, the classic one is where, you know, I'm starting out playing music and I can't 
[00:18:30]  find the fucking next record.  And in my dream, I see that I'm running out of time.  And at the last possible second, I get the next record on and I have that relief for  maybe, uh, whatever, 30 seconds.  And then all of a sudden it goes again.  I can't find the next record.  And this happened all night fucking long.  Yeah.  It was fucked up.  You know, you had those dreams because you've been in radio and stuff.  Before I got into radio, I wouldn't have, there's no reason to have that dream.  Never had that dream.  And within months of us at AAF, I started getting that same fucking dream. 
[00:19:00]  You started having the DJ dream.  Same dream.  And it stinks.  People can relate because they have, uh, you know, a different version of that dream.  I wonder what that dream is called.  I'm sure there's a name for those stupid people that, you know, dream readers and all that.  That have the, uh, when, when you, it's something you do for a living and you're, you're, you  can't for some reason do it.  Right.  It's kind of like, you know, even more basic than that.  When you try to run in your dreams and you can't run and all you want to do is run. 
[00:19:30]  And it doesn't even mean that you're trying to run away from a bad guy or something, but  you just have to run and you can't.  There's times you're crawling.  You're like physically pulling yourself with your hands going like, why can't I move?  I can't move.  That is so frustrating.  Yeah.  And then my other one, which was really stupid.  Cause in the end it didn't really matter.  Donuts and hot dogs.  Donuts and hot dogs.  Yeah.  Uh, dreaming that I wasn't going to graduate college.  Oh, but who cares?  Yeah. 
[00:20:00]  But does that, Sam has talked about, no one has ever asked me for my college diploma.  No, no.  And I learned enough.  Yeah.  I learned enough.  You got it.  That's the one I still get.  What?  The college one.  Yeah.  Like I'm running around like a lunatic in my dream and I'm, I, you know, and I have to get this  paper done, but I can't write my, also my hand doesn't fucking write anymore.  Or I always have the dream that I, I had a class all semester and I forgot.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  You're like, oh, shit.  I didn't go to that class all semester. 
[00:20:30]  Right.  Because I just want to graduate and leave college, but I can't because I forgot that I had the  class.  But, but, but they, but you're not sure the professor knows that you, you skipped the  class the entire semester.  Yeah.  You know how to fix that in the dream.  Think real hard and then rape the shit out of the professor.  Just rape the professor.  Rape the professor.  Male or female.  Doesn't matter.  It's a dream.  Yeah.  It's a dream.  And then when I wake up in the morning, cause I have a long groggy period.  Oh.  Yeah.  It's called six to 10.  I can never remember whether or not I'm in college. 
[00:21:00]  Like I have to remind myself.  You still, I'm awake and I'm like, fuck, do I have a class I have to go to?  No, I'm pretty sure I graduated college like seven or eight years ago, but did I?  That's fucked up.  Hey, it never goes away because even in my advanced years, I still have high school dreams.  I have dreams that I'm, I'm in, I'm, I some, it's not that I'm in high school originally,  but they gave me a chance to get my diploma.  And I go back to school, but I cannot finish. 
[00:21:30]  I, I cut classes.  I do the same shit.  It was the reason I didn't graduate and I keep fucking up.  And in your dreams, you have an opportunity.  And then at some point in the dream, I'm home when I should be in school and I'm thinking  to myself, wait a minute.  And it starts coming back to me.  I'm like, wait, I do radio.  I've been doing radio for years.  I make a great living at it.  Why the fuck am I going back to school?  Yeah.  And I also have that same dream where I'm working in air conditioning and heating again.  And I fucked up and the boss is mad at me and I'm scared that I'm going to get fired. 
[00:22:00]  And then I'm sitting there and it kind of oozes back.  It's like, wait, have a radio show.  Why the fuck do I care about this job?  Wow.  So weird.  But the other part to this discussion, you know, you wake up relieved that, that, that  crazy shit isn't happening and you're not going to jail and you didn't kill anyone  and all that, but it also works the other way where you have the coolest thing ever and  then you wake up and you're like, oh, that was a, oh my God.  Why?  That stinks.  Yeah.  And I just, my, my famous one is of course, Obama.  I thought we were going to be friends. 
[00:22:30]  Not that I want to be friends with Obama, by the way.  I had a dream of Obama too.  And that was in early November and that didn't come true where we hit it off.  And, uh, we, I made him laugh or something and I, we were there, he was either in a restaurant  or, or a bar and we hit it off and then, you know, we exchanged numbers and then I  desperately, I've, I've told this on the air.  Yes.  I loved it.  And I desperately at the end of it said, you're going to call, right?  And then he gave me that look like, wait, I misread this, but he was being polite.  Like, yeah, I'll call. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, hands your number to a secret service guy and just walks away.  Oh, I had him.  And then I woke up that morning and I was all bummed that I wasn't going to be friends  with Obama.  And I'll say it again.  I don't want to be friends with Obama.  I don't like any of these guys.  You know what?  Huh?  Come on.  It's a president of the U.S.  It would be cool.  It's not bad.  Even I, you had my disdain for his policies and whatnot.  If he's your friend, yeah, it's a good friend to have.  Right.  There's not many people that dislike Obama more than you, but let's, uh, let's go through the 
[00:23:30]  scenario.  All of a sudden, I don't know, you're in a bar.  Yeah, right.  All of a sudden they closed down the bar.  But, uh, because he's coming in with his people, but they're like, ah, that guy's  all right.  He's here all the time.  We know.  And Obama kind of wants to have some kind of like, uh, atmosphere and he comes in.  Sounds good.  And, uh, next thing you know, he starts talking to you guys really fucking hit it off.  You fucking asshole!  That'd be me.  Hi, who are you?  Right.  No.  Do you completely change your views on politics?  Because now, like, you're friends with the guy. 
[00:24:00]  How does that work out in you?  I would.  But he's talking like, look, you know, next time I go to Hawaii, I got a spot on Air Force  One.  I mean, you got, you got this shit.  This is very nice.  Air Force One.  You know, uh, you know, come to the White House where we're going to be, uh, having movie  nights and we're going to pick you up in the old helicopter.  Oh, God.  You don't even have to deal with traffic.  All that shit.  I mean, you got the fucking red carpet.  You got a text from Barry that said funny shit on the show today.  Right. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, man.  I'm being serious.  I want a real answer.  Do you change?  I'm trying to be.  Do you change your views and your politics?  I'm trying to be a real human being here.  Not a superhero that would say, no, I am my principles.  Yeah, but I don't think, I think everyone would say fuck it to their principles, uh, depending  on, you know, something like this.  I'd go for it and I would rationalize it by saying to myself, in time, when this, you  know, friendship, we get a little closer.  Right.  I could use this closeness and friendship to perhaps sway some of his ideology through 
[00:25:00]  discussion.  No, it has nothing to do with that.  Son of a bitch.  No, it has nothing to do with that.  No.  You never infiltrate.  Yeah.  That's Air Force One.  I'm going.  I'm going.  Fuck it.  He rules.  He rules.  People.  You would look like the biggest asshole.  But me, it wouldn't be cool.  Oh, come on.  Yeah.  You'd go from complaining about the president's vacations to vacationing with the president. 
[00:25:30]  Yo, nigga, what's up?  That'd be me stepping onto Air Force One.  Yo, nigga, what's up?  That's hilarious.  So what's going on?  Oh, come on.  It's Air Force One.  The White House.  Please.  Fucking in the White House?  Would you?  I'm telling you, yes.  You would.  That would rule.  You guys want to get into some shit?  We're really good on this show, man.  I'm telling you.  Crazy.  Even though it's a who gives a fuck.  The Britney Spears story hit the paper today.  I told you exactly what was happening yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  That they're giving.  She's quitting before they fire her. 
[00:26:00]  We said it yesterday, and now it's a huge article in the paper.  The only reason I bring that up, because it leads me to the next thing we've been talking  about for a while that is finally happening.  We watch this dumb MSNBC in the morning.  Actually, we don't watch MSNBC.  We watch all of them.  We choose MSNBC, CNN, and Fox.  We used to try to do local news, but they're so fucking hacky and wacky.  Hacky and wacky.  Hacky and wacky in the morning.  Oh!  That we couldn't do it anymore.  Excuse me.  So, you know, these are the news stations that we choose to kind of get the feel of what 
[00:26:30]  America is talking about.  So we could be a little more informed.  Yeah.  A lot of times we see MSNBC and those two starting their show.  Yeah.  And we've said many fucking times, this Mika Broad is a real, and I don't use the word  often, but I have to hear.  She's a real cunt.  Whoa!  I don't like that word, man.  Whoa!  Not a big fan of the old cunt word.  I use it right after the and another word. 
[00:27:00]  But she really is.  She's a twat.  She's a cunt.  She stinks.  She has no reason to be on MSNBC whatsoever.  I don't know what the fuck's going on.  I've heard rumors that she's dating or married to someone that's in a high place, and that's  why she's got the gig.  I've heard that.  I don't know if it's true, because personally, I don't think she's very good.  No.  She distracts from the conversation that's going on in the morning with the guys, even  if there's another woman there.  Right.  She seems to want to stay too close to this formatted, outlined newscast and takes away 
[00:27:30]  from the spontaneity.  And I had a weird day with Morning Joe.  I got an invite to go through MSNBC.  I don't remember that.  I don't even know what the reason was, but I have a strange feeling that they were kind  of seeing what I was all about.  And maybe there was a gig or something over there.  I don't know, because I don't know why I was invited there.  Right, right.  And I was there, and they did a whole segment that they chopped the shit out of and made 
[00:28:00]  into something else, which was okay at best.  I'm not going to sit here and brag about it.  But we filmed some good stuff, weird, edgy shit.  Yeah.  And my point is, Morning Joe is a cool guy, really cool guy.  Yeah.  Joe Scarborough.  And he should be doing that show by himself.  But for some reason, they teamed him up with this fucking broad who adds nothing.  Yeah.  And when they talk about sports and guy shit, she gets really mad.  She sits there under her breath, which you can hear, by the way, under her breath.  Right.  She's like, all right, okay, we've got to get to the news. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  And they're trying to discuss a big story for the day.  It's not like they picked this little shit story out of the paper.  Right.  It's not like they're just doing sports for sports sake.  They understand their news before sports, but when it's a big sporting event, they know  it's important, and they try to do a little time on it.  And what she adds is like, are you done?  Yeah.  Can I read the news now?  I mean, she's such a cunt.  Yeah.  Terrible.  Terrible.  It's Mika.  Anyway, we said that they would have problems. 
[00:29:00]  Eventually, something would happen because the, you know, the, what am I trying to say?  Sexual tension?  No, it's not even that.  It's like the tension in general, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, there is a tension.  Really bad.  And I guess they finally went at it.  Reached a boiling point.  Reached a boiling point yesterday?  Oh, yeah.  We said this would happen.  We absolutely said this would happen.  We've been waiting for Joe Scarborough to finally go, what the fuck?  Just backhands her.  That would be great.  Just leans over.  Right.  Fucking cracks her right in the face with the back of his hand. 
[00:29:30]  Right.  You'd think you'd have to apologize.  Kicks her out from the stool when she's sitting on it.  Right.  Yeah, she just, she rolls her eyes.  She, I don't know why she's on that show.  Yeah.  I mean, Joe could, the Morning Joe, he could easily do it by himself.  Easily.  Yeah.  Anyway, so, Morning Joe and Mika get into an argument.  They were, yeah, they were talking about Obama.  Morning Joe was saying that Obama was not a diverse White House, you know, it's cabinet  or whatever.  There's not a lot of women.  Yeah, they're talking about the not enough women.  Right. 
[00:30:00]  Really a lot of kind of white guys.  And then Mika is a big Obama supporter.  Yeah.  And he's arguing that.  All right, let's start there.  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  No, who gives a fuck?  Yeah.  I come from a place a long time ago.  A galaxy far, far away.  Exactly.  To land down under.  At this point, a long fucking time ago.  Yeah.  Where they just hired the best person for the fucking job.  Oh, boy.  But now they.  Hey, it's regular Joe.  Huh?  Yeah.  Hey, the best person for the job.  Yeah.  Exactly.  But somewhere, I don't know when it started, it's like they now look at your staff, no matter 
[00:30:30]  what business you're in, ah, you need another black in there.  Why?  Ah, you need a fucking dikey lezzo in there.  You're right.  They say, and the Congress has one of the most diverse that it's been in years.  And you're like, does that mean good?  Does that make it good just because it's diverse?  Or is it coincidental that the best person for the best job would make it diverse? 
[00:31:00]  I don't think that makes sense.  That absolutely means that people that were more qualified for that fucking job didn't  get the job.  And that goes across the board in America.  Yeah.  Everyone's worried about diversity.  But then that's when the argument kicks.  Oh, so you mean a woman isn't the best person for the job then?  You mean to tell me.  Right.  I remember when I was first starting out on radio, this did start happening a little  bit.  And I forgot.  What was the official law? 
[00:31:30]  There was an actual law.  What, for women or diversity?  No, it was like you had to have a certain percentage of black people in some companies.  Affirmative action?  It might have been affirmative action.  Equal opportunity?  Equal opportunity.  Equal opportunity might have been Iraq.  Sure.  And I remember, you know what?  Well, whatever.  I got to be tough with what I say here.  Uh-oh.  Let's do it.  I don't want to hurt some people.  Let's get it on the table.  Basically, I was up for a job in radio, and I'm not just saying this. 
[00:32:00]  I absolutely was the guy.  Yeah.  I know it.  Everyone around me knew it, and they couldn't do it because of the equal opportunity show.  Oh, boy.  And I lost out to a black guy at the time.  Do you keep in contact with him?  Are you burning bridges?  What station is it working at?  We'll drop to over.  Uh-oh.  What did they say?  Nick Cannon.  Nick Cannon.  Oh, my God.  Wow, that's amazing.  Al Roker.  Jesus. 
[00:32:30]  He shits himself.  Oh, my God.  It'll come out in the wash.  I promise you.  I'm not right now.  But, so they're talking about what?  Diversity on Morning Joe, and that's what got things going?  Yeah, the diversity of Obama's White House.  So, he's hiring a lot of white guys?  And basically, the whole time, like, Miko is, you know, and Joe was, like, laughing at her.  Right.  Being like, oh, and she said, you know, he is the first African-American president.  And Morning Joe goes, he is?  Let me Google this. 
[00:33:00]  You've got to be kidding me.  Oh, good for him.  And he's, like, laughing at her.  So, this picks up when she's, like, you know, this is not funny.  Ugh.  The first African president, that was, like, a big deal, what, the first month or two?  Yeah.  They're still saying that four years later?  Then it just became, oh, he's a fucking, you know, left wing Democrat.  He's the latest, to me, he's the latest asshole in that fucking seat.  There you go.  Period.  Yeah.  So, this is them going at it?  Yes.  That's the first piece of legislation he signed.  I'm just reinforcing what you said. 
[00:33:30]  What are you looking at me like that for?  I'm actually trying to ignore the, uh, I, I am afraid to use the word because it will not  be good for you.  Oh, boy.  Okay?  Because you're being chauvinistic right now.  Oh, am I really?  Oh.  All right.  And you need to stop.  You need to stop.  All right, mommy.  All right, mommy.  Every bit of sexuality she could have dries up like the fucking Serengeti.  She's, it's the Serengeti Lush.  Kalahari! 
[00:34:00]  That's what I meant.  Yeah.  Some of these assholes on TV, they're fun to, to watch.  Yeah.  She's not.  Male chauvinist.  She's not.  She, she kind of came off like everyone's mommy right there.  Right.  Ugh.  Who calls somebody a chauvinist?  Yeah.  They used to like.  You male chauvinist pig.  Saved by the belly.  Jesse used to say chauvinist.  Nobody says chauvinist anymore.  I think the first time I heard it was like the Billie Jean King fucking, um, what's his  name?  Oh God, but.  The guy that played tennis.  But he had every right to say all that stuff. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was a beast of a woman.  Bobby Riggs.  Bobby Riggs.  He was a male chauvinist pig.  She was more of a man than he was.  Of course.  Holy fuck.  Yes.  Uh.  Okay.  Because you're being chauvinistic right now.  And you need to stop.  Oh, am I really?  All right?  You know what?  Because I, I'm sorry.  This is not funny.  No, it's not funny.  And this is what we've talked about a million fucking times.  Oh.  And if we give any advice to other radio guys, don't fucking do radio with a woman. 
[00:35:00]  The hole.  That's now me being male chauvinist.  But it is the God's honest truth.  She is the hole right now.  Listen to the hole.  Look, and in all fairness, there are exceptions.  Sure.  I'm not a big fan of his, but Howard and Robin, it works.  But in fucking general, women on the radio stink.  Unless it's like a female comic, Bonnie comes in here, Amy Schumer, they're great.  Yeah.  But when you get that sidekick, bitch.  And they could obviously do a radio show with guys.  Yeah.  So don't get confused. 
[00:35:30]  But it's that, it's the model that most of radio uses where they get a couple edgy guys and then they throw the fucking woman in because they think it needs a woman's point of view.  She's got to rein it back.  That's why I'm here.  Right.  Man, put me in place.  And of course, we, uh, that is of course the hole that we've described many times in the show.  She is, she's the definition of the hole.  We shouldn't be joking about this.  And here she is now telling everyone, everyone on the show what's funny also.  Oh, well, she said, that's not funny. 
[00:36:00]  Oh, really?  Really?  Yeah.  How the fuck do you know?  That's not funny.  I bet people at home are laughing right now watching you get all fucking pissy about this segment.  I bet.  Oh, you could tell by her face this morning that they're not over it.  No, especially since this clip went on every news website.  Yeah, they're not over.  You could tell.  Look at her face.  It's all over.  She's fucking pouting about, uh, about, you know, getting rid of these.  Uspo.  Oof.  Uspo.  I really do feel sorry for Joe. 
[00:36:30]  And I write, I tweet him every once in a while and I tell him I feel sorry for him.  I once tweeted him.  You're acting like, he's sitting there going like, I'm glad Opie has went back.  Thank God.  I don't know.  We fucking hit it off that one dumb day.  It was stupid, but we hit it off.  I'll be glad to see someone sees my point here.  Yes.  And I know they got the, uh, the raw footage of my day at MSNBC.  I put up one little clip, uh, I don't know, a couple of years ago and I don't even need  to promote it.  It's nothing big. 
[00:37:00]  Trust me.  But I know the guy still works there.  I want the raw footage so I can make something of it.  Because I was doing, we were doing just stupid shit.  Uh, but I, I tweeted, uh, morning Joe.  I said, I feel bad that you have to do a show every morning with a robot.  Oh, you.  Look at her.  Ugh.  Look at the look.  I'm not going to answer your question with a question.  And I, I still don't get it because I'm in the bed. 
[00:37:30]  It's on the dirt.  It's on the dirt.  You can put a suit on or anything.  Nah.  You don't give a fuck how he looks.  Look at that hair.  That's right off the pillow.  That's right.  I get to just put a little gel in my hair quickly.  That's it.  I don't have time to shower.  I don't have time for that.  Every inch of, uh, his outfit was thawed out.  Jesus Lord, it's a fire.  He gets up probably at midnight.  Yeah.  To do the mornings on MSNBC with these guys. 
[00:38:00]  Mm-hmm.  Just so he could fucking look good.  Look like he didn't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He has to look like he didn't try to look like that.  Right.  He's the type of guy that picks out what buttons he wants, put on his shirts.  Right.  Yes.  I don't know.  They just came on the shirt.  I don't know what they are.  It's off the rack stuff here.  I don't tailor anything.  Whatever the wife put down on the bed, I just...  Ah.  We did, uh, Donnie Deutsch's failed TV show.  Yes.  And what happened there, he...  We were...  I think we were on the first show.  Mm-hmm.  But then what happened was they were doing shows a month in advance, and the stuff we 
[00:38:30]  talked about, he talked about topical stuff.  Oh, right.  Remember this?  Yes.  And then they couldn't air our segment because all the shit we talked about was really  old.  It was old shit.  And then I think they invited us back, and we're like, you know what, you're like, yeah,  I mean...  Yeah, have fun, and then the show is canceled.  But you figure it out, and then maybe we'll come back.  We'll are.  This is not funny.  No, it's not funny.  You know, it's not funny if you're a woman that works in the Obama administration, and  you want to go to the highest rungs of that administration. 
[00:39:00]  It's not funny.  And you can attack me and be personal and make personal attacks against me.  Oh, my God.  You've got a president that you worship on this show every day.  Wow.  You've savaged Mitt Romney.  He has a picture that if a Republican president had a picture in that cabinet in the New York  Times would be savage, and you're calling the wrong guy a chauvinist.  You're calling the wrong guy a chauvinist.  And seriously?  Hold on.  You want to call me a chauvinist? 
[00:39:30]  Right here.  Let me help you.  No, no, no, no, no.  Let me help you.  Okay.  Are you really, knowing me and seeing me work around here for five years, you want to call  me a chauvinist on television?  No, I'm just saying that.  Do you want to say that?  I'm with Katty was chauvinist.  Do you want to say that on television, that I'm a chauvinist?  I didn't.  You did?  You did?  No, I didn't.  I said, the way you're acting is chauvinistic, especially the way you were handling this conversation.  Well, if that's what you're going to do, because your president that you worship on this show  every day is selecting men, and even Ruth Marcus and other people who have said, the New York 
[00:40:00]  Times going back to 2009, have said that this White House is not a positive place for women.  And you can look at the stories.  If you want to attack me as your only line of defense, go ahead.  You already did.  Listen.  Am I a chauvinist?  I think they're a great practice.  Am I a chauvinist?  Let's just answer that question right now.  The way that you conducted your office in Congress and here in Congress, the way I ran 
[00:40:30]  my office there, the way I run my office here, am I a chauvinist?  But Joe, you can't just laugh off.  Leave your own book.  Joe, you can't just laugh off.  You can't throw attacks around like that.  Okay.  All right.  Personal attacks like that, because you're embarrassed about what Barack Obama's doing.  I'm not.  That's just not fair.  I have been inside.  I've worked with the White House on this issue, and I've seen it. 
[00:41:00]  And I'm very, very, very proud of what this president has done.  It has nothing to do with worshiping him.  God, I hate when these clips just end.  Wow.  I want to hear more, but obviously that was the end of it.  He had had it right there.  But see, that would have been a jumping off point where he says, you know, I'm done.  Yeah.  But for some reason, he can't say that because she's got something at MSNBC.  Wow.  That keeps her in that seat.  She got hammered right there. 
[00:41:30]  Of course she got hammered.  She went into backpedal mode immediately.  Good for Joe.  I hope this is the beginning of the end, because I do like the guy.  Yeah.  And I think he does an all right job on TV.  I really do.  And the guys he puts on the show with them and all.  Yeah.  He's got a good rapport with people.  Yeah.  You know, you don't have to agree with everything they're saying, certainly.  But I think he does a pretty good job every morning.  And we were watching them live as we were playing that clip. 
[00:42:00]  You could tell, wow.  Yeah.  They're having a rough morning trying to get through this.  Ah, shit.  And I bet you, because they got sat down in some dumb office somewhere.  Oh, you think?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, they need the chemistry to be a little better.  You know what I mean?  They need the help.  They've never had chemistry.  They've never been there.  They've never had chemistry.  It's a well-known fact.  Me and Ann have fought over the fucking years, but we have the chemistry.  They've never even had the fucking chemistry.  No, they never had anything.  Nothing.  It's obvious.  Nothing.  Terrible.  It's obvious they should just fucking move on. 
[00:42:30]  That's great.  I like that.  We'd known that was going to happen eventually.  It's a funny one.  It's going to get worse, too.  You think?  Yeah.  They'll get into another fight.  Sooner than later, right?  At some point in the morning, Joe will just be like, yeah, he'll say something.  Yeah.  I mean, he's smart because he was in Congress.  He knows how to be a public figure.  But at some point, he's got to get fed up with her.  I can't imagine he wants to do the show with her.  No way.  Like, he doesn't wake up and say, oh, it's a fun show. 
[00:43:00]  Right.  You know?  Wow.  All right.  Good for them.  Good for them.  People love that Morning Joe show, though.  Do they?  Yeah.  I was hanging out with a bunch of Jess's friends.  I didn't even know how normal people interact.  They were all saying how great Morning Joe is.  They love liberals.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, crap.  I bet.  Oh, yeah.  A bunch of arts people.  Oh, yeah.  It's a better show than Fox and Friends.  I know you're a Fox guy.  No, not as far as their shows go. 
[00:43:30]  I think they do a better job on MSNBC.  Kind of keeping it fun and a little, I don't know.  Well, they try.  Only that show, by the way.  That's the only show that's even watchable if you are not a crazy lefty.  Well, I think Scarborough was a Republican, right?  Is he still a Republican?  I don't even know.  He seems more like a moderate, I think.  He's pretty fucking left for a Republican.  But, I mean, compared to the other people, though, it's crazy.  Yeah.  Compared to other people on MSNBC, he's a religious right. 
[00:44:00]  What about Chris Matthews?  Hey, you know, I think he's a chauvinist.  I love Chris Matthews.  No, he's a nut.  I love Chris Matthews.  That guy is fucking crazy.  That's why I love him.  Really excitable.  He is excitable.  He has a lot of passion.  He is excitable.  Hey.  All right.  Can you imagine having a fucking look at your ex every three minutes in front of your  face?  I think about it every time I see him.  Dude, it's every fucking five minutes on these news channels. 
[00:44:30]  And, by the way, don't go to a movie theater.  No, it's on there, too, right?  Every movie I've been to.  What are we talking about?  Oh, Melissa Stetton.  Right?  She's in the fucking new Lincoln commercials.  They're national ads.  Right.  And it's like every two seconds I turn my head and four TVs got her head turning in the  backseat of the car.  And it's a double shot, so there's two of her?  Yes.  And it's like, all right, that's cool and everything.  But, you know, maybe as a guy, you don't have to look at your ex every fucking day, multiple 
[00:45:00]  times a day.  Would you date two of her?  No.  The commercial has two of her.  With the way she snooped around, it felt like there were five of her going through all  my shit.  My phones, my computer, my iPad, my bag, my wallet, my fucking drawers.  Well, she didn't really have any reason to do that, right?  Yeah.  Why would she be so suspicious?  I don't know.  Was she paranoid or was there some suspicions there?  Look, there was paranoia there. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  Doesn't it suck where your chick is paranoid, but she keeps finding things?  I hate that.  But she's just paranoid.  Look, I may have been chit-chatting.  That's my prerogative.  I'm married.  A little chit-chatting.  Yeah.  You know what?  Got her suspicions up.  And fuck that, because you know what?  If you're a guy and you chit-chat and stuff, even if you're not doing anything, that's crazy.  Oh, boy, what are you doing?  Oh, who's that?  Oh, who are you following? 
[00:46:00]  Who's that?  I couldn't even follow people on Twitter.  I'm like, I have to assess, like, can I follow this person?  And she and other girls, I know this in relationships and stuff with guys out there, they can talk  to and follow whoever they want.  Oh, it's just, and then they have, oh, no, you're stupid, because this is just, they're  now filling the blank of why she's justified to talk to this guy.  Fuck you, bitches.  It's the bitches that are bitches.  Right.  So I had it.  Pessie said it years ago. 
[00:46:30]  Exactly.  They live by that motto.  Yeah.  It's the bitches that are bitches.  It's the bitches that are bitches.  You got that song there, Yoron?  It's the bitches that are bitches.  Maybe we'll play that into break today.  It's the bitches that are bitches.  Because they're acknowledging that you might be trying to fuck another chick, but they'll  never acknowledge that the guy they're hanging out with is trying to fuck them.  Yes!  That's why he's hanging out with you.  Exactly.  You think they know that that guy's trying to fuck them?  Or are they that naive?  This is, they're not naive.  Because I really don't know the answer to that question.  I think they lie to themselves because they want to think they're actually interesting 
[00:47:00]  or funny or whatever it is.  Like they, you know, they don't want to look at, like, wait a minute.  That person is funnier than me.  Yes.  But they don't get the kind of attention that I get.  Uh-huh.  And they also have this thing where even if the guy wants to fuck them, I'm the woman.  I give the say whether we fuck or not.  Yeah.  Like, so that's totally different because it's up to me.  You're the guy, and if you're chit-chatting with a girl, well, now, you know, because you  obviously want to fuck her, but if she wants to fuck you, you're going to fuck. 
[00:47:30]  I know I'm not fucking him.  No woman in a relationship has ever been swept off her feet unexpectedly.  Right.  The internet's never destroyed relationships.  Anyone else see what just went down?  What happened?  Fucking built a bridge.  Didn't even tell you guys about it.  What was the bridge?  Built it three weeks ago.  Who was it?  You built a bridge here?  Built a fucking bridge.  No.  That's right.  I'm going to guess.  Go ahead.  Jay Thomas.  Yep.  No.  That was Jay Thomas? 
[00:48:00]  I built the fucking bridge back.  You built the Jay Thomas bridge?  Yep.  Does that mean we have Ira on the show?  Nope.  Fuck that guy.  But I respect what he said about it.  Oh.  What did he say?  Yeah, a little private shit there, Sam Roberts.  Oh, look at that, Sam.  Some people actually keep secrets and have discussions and then don't blab them all over the building.  Like, hmm, Sam Roberts.  Let's just put it this way.  A lot of people on this show are very aware of Bobo.  Very.  Just imagine that Bobo had a very successful, very intelligent, and a very normal brother looking out for him. 
[00:48:30]  Gotcha.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  And let's just say that maybe, this is all like stuff I'm just coming up with.  Hypotheticals.  And then let's say maybe that highly intelligent, successful brother came to me and aunt and said,  not really happy with what you're doing with my brother, but I trust you that you take care of him. 
[00:49:00]  Right.  You can't be having other people come along because this highly, hypothetically successful brother will be like, now you're pawning him off onto other shows?  I don't think so.  God.  And something like that was said, and I looked at Jay, and I said, right, I respect that.  And then he also said, and then he also said, which I kind of respect it too.  He goes, and look, to be honest, I want my own guys too.  He said that.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  But for some reason we, we let our guys go everywhere.  Well, our guys are all whores.  There are times, like, people forget that, like, some of our guys were our guys.  Yeah.  They've done Ron and Fez so much, they think they're Ron and Fez guys.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, not every show would allow me to be on every channel on the platform.  Oh.  Well, you're not really.  That's special.  Go see whatever you want.  Whatever.  You want to go to Jay Thomas?  You want to do it right now?  Go over to the morning mashup. 
[00:50:00]  But we shook hands, said happy holidays, and now he just walked by.  Building bridges.  And that was the first fucking chance, and he gave a good, how do you do, as he walked by.  A little wave.  Look at that.  Just two radio guys just acknowledging, doing radio.  Yeah.  I told him when he was on.  He was one of the first guys that I was entertained by on the radio.  Ooh.  He did a pretty wacky morning zoo-ish type show, but I was just a kid.  As a kid, that was great shit, man.  And as a kid, he was on 99X, I believe, here in New York City. 
[00:50:30]  And it was one of the first shows I really, really got into when I was growing up.  Yes.  There you go.  Getting ready for school and shit.  I would listen to Jay Thomas.  That is the truth.  Who is that?  And I couldn't tell you what he did anymore, because it's been so many years.  But I remember it kept my attention.  What?  He talked to Cyra, I guess.  Who?  Jay Thomas.  That's what he does now.  Yeah.  It's the weather.  Oh, no.  I've heard his show on Sirius XM.  It's not bad at all.  Good stuff?  Yeah, it's not bad at all. 
[00:51:00]  I just don't listen to a lot of radio these days.  All right.  I thought One Direction, was that who that was?  That was The Wanted.  What's this little kid now with the concert and the little kid dancing on stage?  It's adorable.  What's going on there?  Look at the little kid.  The daddy's doing a fucking show.  Father, Paul B. Anderson, is a Christian singer, as Eric told us, who says his son always dances  when he plays guitar at home.  But that this was not planned.  The clip has been circulating on YouTube with a thousand, a couple thousand hits over just  the past day. 
[00:51:30]  It's fantastic.  A couple thousand views.  And that video's on TV?  Damn it!  Are you kidding me?  I don't understand how in a...  Fuck!  You got a house full of babies.  Oh, right?  Me?  Yeah.  It's like a daycare center over there.  Use those shits, you know?  Yeah, come on.  Babies and kittens, man.  Babies and kittens.  I've told you, I've got two videos I know would do really well, but keeping the kids  private, unfortunately.  Pixelate their faces like they're criminals.  You know what?  I kind of thought that. 
[00:52:00]  I got one of my son at 18 months old climbing a lifeguard stand all the way to the top.  Holy shit.  It's adorable.  And my mother-in-law was not happy about it.  But it's 18 months.  They all look the same there.  You think?  You can pop that up.  No one will even recognize it.  That's sort of what I'm hoping.  Yeah.  He started climbing, and I'm like, you know, he's doing pretty good.  And he went all the way to the top.  How tall was that shit?  Most adults don't want to do that.  A tall lifeguard chair? 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was...  Damn.  It was...  I guess I could reach the...  It was probably eight to nine feet.  And your instinct was...  Eight feet, maybe?  Grab the camera.  Go for the camera.  Go for the camera.  Yeah.  And my mother-in-law...  Your instinct.  My mother-in-law was ready to grab him at any second.  I'm like, no, no, no.  Let's see what happens here.  I'm rolling fucking video, man.  Out of the shot.  Out of the shot.  I was watching his feet, though.  As long as his feet are on those fucking steps, he's good.  And what if they weren't?  Were you close enough to dive, to make the diving catch?  If I had to, I would have saved him.  In the end zone?  If I had to, I would have saved him, yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  Then I have another one where he's trying to figure out the automatic doors for the first  time.  Oh.  Like at the supermarket or something.  Yeah.  You step on the little thing, the door opens.  He couldn't figure it out.  No.  And started running away like it was a monster.  It is to them.  It's a big, chomping monster.  Go through there.  If you made a video of you yelling at him, trying to get him to do viral video stuff  like a little league coach.  That's fucking funny.  And like, he had to keep showing you like retaking stuff and yelling at him. 
[00:53:30]  Get a bitch!  Like he fell off the lifeguard stand and you told him to get up and do it again.  Come to the top.  You know what?  God damn you, Sam Roberts.  That's pretty funny.  Not Sam on Twitter.  You get the big plug today for that.  You just gave me a great idea for a video.  Dude, it'd be fine.  I need someone's kittens.  Kittens?  Yes.  You fucking kittens.  No, because that's been done.  That's been done.  I can't do screaming at the cat guy.  He already did it.  But I'm going to take your idea, but I'm going to do it with kittens. 
[00:54:00]  Good.  And you know how every kitten video does really well.  Oh, it's amazing.  So I'll have all the props to cute kittens and all the shit.  It could get into like fucking paper bags and all that shit.  And nothing works out.  And it's just me screaming, damn it, over and over again as the kitten will not.  Trying to put the kitten in the bag and he won't fucking cooperate.  The bag rips.  Right.  Fuck, give me another bag.  All right.  Who's got kittens?  I'm not even joking.  I want to do this video now.  Little kittens.  And where do we do it?  But I want 40% of the revenue.  Holy shit. 
[00:54:30]  It's my idea.  I'll give you nothing.  Sam Roberts, we just need to talk about your fee.  I give you life.  You know that.  Oh, man.  I know, but I don't see you.  I give you life.  I'm barely living.  Watch what I do.  Oh.  What happened?  That's it.  Mic on, mic off.  Do you still want 40%?  No.  All right.  By the way, that mic on, mic off is really just a. . .  That's your life.  That's your life.  That's your life.  I know.  This is how easy it is.  One day I could just say that's it.  One button.  And nobody hears from Sam again. 
[00:55:00]  Nope.  You still want your 40%?  You can keep the 40.  A lot deeper than just that microphone turning on and off, my friend.  That button.  You think Bruiser's got what it takes to be in my viral kitten video?  Bruiser Brody is the size of about 14 kittens.  He's a giant, fat, big fat cat.  So maybe he's the fucking punchline.  We bring him in at the end.  Yeah, let's try it with this.  We'll just plomp him down.  Yeah, we'll start with the cute kittens, and then we'll fucking move on to Bruiser.  Yeah.  I think I might have video of Bruiser when he was a kitten. 
[00:55:30]  I should try to upload that.  Aw.  See what it does?  Oh, if you get a viral video out of that.  How do I get kittens for a weekend?  I think you just adopt them, and then you could probably just throw them in the river or bury them.  Oh, in one of those gunny sacks?  Yeah, yeah.  That would be nice.  A great punchline.  A bunch of kittens in a rock in a bag.  Yeah, yeah.  Off the bridge.  Director's cut.  I remember the old days, the most tragic news in your fucking little town was they found  a burlap bag filled with cats or kittens, and the whole town would be depressed for 
[00:56:00]  a week or two.  The burlap bag of kittens.  And now it's, you know, school shootings.  Great.  Right.  Yeah.  It was stupid, you know, bags of cats and stuff, which is the most horrendous thing.  Not the most, but that's just horrific.  Too fast.  I don't even want to make light of it.  It did fucking be, it was a depressing thing.  Because kittens are adorable.  Can I get kittens for a weekend?  I am very allergic to cats, so we got to make this video quick. 
[00:56:30]  All right.  That could be part of the thing that annoys you.  You start going like, scratch, damn it!  Oh, and sneezing and shit?  Yes, you're ruining the whole video.  I think this could work.  What kind of props?  What kind of props work for the kitten videos?  I got a lot of kitten stuff.  I got a lot of cat toys and stuff.  And like, uh, obstacle.  And the kitten just sits there and doesn't fucking want to play with it.  We might be able to use your green screen.  Yeah, we'd use a green screen to green screen in more kittens.  What do they even get into?  Like, shoes and stuff?  Yeah. 
[00:57:00]  Cups?  If you could find a giant coffee cup with a kitten in it, stop it.  Stop it.  So the whole video could be a coffee cup and this dopey kitten and me filming it.  Trying to get him in there and he won't go in.  And be screaming dead over and over again.  And then I'll bring in giant bruiser Brody at the end.  And you'll be screaming at me because his paw can't even fit in a mug at this point.  Oh my God.  See, this guy's got four free kittens.  I have to pick them up in the Bronx.  Yeah, but he...  But then what do I have to do?  I have to find them homes?  Exactly. 
[00:57:30]  Plus, you've got to watch where you film this because your son's going to like the cats.  All of a sudden, you've got to keep all these kittens in the house.  Yeah.  I like this idea for real.  Yeah.  I really like this one.  I think this is the one set.  We can't film it in my apartment because I can't fit the green screen in there when  I set it up.  Oh, right.  It takes up a third of the apartment.  We probably could fit it in like a third of my living room.  Yeah.  Your living room is bigger than my entire apartment, so...  Is it really?  Yeah, I would think so.  Nice.  It's not nice. 
[00:58:00]  Your TV is almost as big as my apartment.  Nice, man.  Isn't it weird?  Like, the paradox that happens if I say something like, wouldn't it be nice if you could green  screen a bigger house so that your green screen fits?  Oh, my God.  I think it bad.  You should live in a green screen world.  That would be cool.  Yeah.  Where your tiny little apartment is now some huge palace.  Looks big, like the holodeck.  Of course, you can't walk through it, but it would give you the illusion that you'd be 
[00:58:30]  in a big spot.  Just set up a long Kubrickian hallway behind me.  Yes.  That would be great.  You can invite people over, and they'd be like, this place is lovely.  And you'd go, yeah, yeah, just sit down.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't walk around.  Don't look behind you.  Look into the...  Look how I've flipped the camera screen around.  Look where you're at.  Yeah, just look into the camera.  Don't turn around, though.  No, don't.  What's with the lights?  Don't worry about it.  Just look into the...  Very good.  I want to see your beauty.  We got David Duchovny coming in today, an old friend of ours. 
[00:59:00]  You know, Roland yesterday said that he and his friends used to dress up like Fox  Mulder and go to high school?  Really?  Yes.  How do you do that?  What a bunch of dorks.  They wore suits.  They just put a suit on?  Oh, that's all it was.  Yeah, they didn't even have badges.  You could call yourself Fox Mulder, but in essence, you're just going to school in a  suit.  And Bob Kelly's coming in.  Has he made his big announcement officially?  He did it on Raw Dog over the break.  And I...  Oh, he did.  Oh, he did?  Yep.  Great.  So everyone knows he's...  Can I say it?  I'm scared to even say it.  He did it on his podcast, and then he did it on my show on Raw Dog.  All right, so Bob Kelly's going to be a father, which we're very, very happy for him. 
[00:59:30]  Very excited.  And he's already fucking texting me all the time with baby questions.  He was on that Twitter talking about, Dad, I need a baby monitor.  What the fuck?  It's like Mr. Tech Guy should know.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  He's a sucker in the baby business world.  Oh, he's going to buy all that shit.  Dude, if you go into like a...  This is going to bore you.  I'm sorry.  Real fast, though.  If you go into a baby gap or something like that, one of these places, you could get caught  up in all the shit you could buy.  And then we did for our first kid. 
[01:00:00]  And then you realize half of it stayed in boxes.  We didn't use any of it.  Great.  So for the second kid, we woke up a little bit.  But someone like Bob Kelly?  Yeah.  I can't wait to hear what he buys.  Bob also told me that they had a kid before, but they named him Toiletto because he was  an old falash.  Jesus.  He said it within five minutes of telling me.  Oh, my God.  He goes, this was a conversation.  I go, well, are you telling the due date?  Is that public?  And he goes, oh, it shouldn't be, right? 
[01:00:30]  I go, well, maybe not.  No, I'm going to keep that private.  And I go, oh, okay.  And then he goes, yeah, you know, we tried before.  We had another one.  But he was an old Toiletto.  Toiletto.  That's what's public and the due date is private.  That's completely a tragic thing that happens to a lot of people out there.  Yeah, he was all good, though.  He found the humor in it.  He did.  It was hilarious.  I guess sometimes you got to do that so you don't cry.  I don't know.  Toiletto.  So he wrote his latest on the baby stuff because we're going back and forth now. 
[01:01:00]  He writes, how do you, how do you, oh, what do you use to carry your baby?  These are actual Bob Kelly baby questions.  Hands.  And how bad is the baby shit, honestly?  Those are the, actually, those are the first two questions.  He's going to be, I wrote, I only hated the baby shit twice with my son.  And then I wrote, the flu sucks.  Yuck.  Oh, man.  When your kid is sick, that's when the poo is brutal.  But then, I mean, day in and day out, you don't even notice it. 
[01:01:30]  And then I told him to carry his baby around with his bandolier and a wicker basket.  Yeah, I got my baby bandolier.  This guy is going to have everything.  Oh, yeah.  He's going to waste so much money.  You're not even going to be able to recognize him when he's walking around because he's going  to have so much baby shit on him.  Not baby shit, baby stuff for the baby.  Accessories.  Accessories.  He's going to accessorize.  So Bob Kelly will be here in about an hour or so.  Can't wait.  Love Bobby. 
[01:02:00]  And now we eat.  Tarantino has another great clip, huh?  Yeah, this was really good.  He's fucking had it, huh?  This one, this one's really good.  Like, this one is almost as good as the Samuel L. Jackson clip.  Damn!  Really?  Yeah, he went off on a British reporter because the British reporter started pressing him about,  you know, violence and movies and life being connected.  My simple point on that is the whole world is watching violent movies and playing violent  video games, and we have the problem way worse than most of the other countries. 
[01:02:30]  So you can't just say it's violent movies and violent video games.  It's not as easy as saying that.  No.  Someone brought up a great point yesterday, too, on Twitter, talking about the fact that  they say that the big cities where the guns are illegal and they still have a lot of gun  crime, it's because in these other places where you can get guns easily, and then they  bring them over to the cities.  How come there's not violent crime in the places where you can go by the guns easily?  By the way, shouldn't it be in both places where you can get them easily, because then  there's a lot of guns, and then when they take them illegally, because then there's a 
[01:03:00]  lot of guns, but it's only where they take them illegally where there's the violence.  It's very...  It doesn't make sense.  It's extremely complicated to figure this shit out.  It really is.  But the news makes it like it's black and white.  I'm exhausted.  Which is kind of dumb.  I think that's why I slept so long yesterday.  I was completely exhausted physically by the gun control argument, and I had to sleep the  entire day and night away.  You pretty much slept, did we do the math, like 14 straight hours? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was up for like...  15.  You might have hit 15 hours.  Wow.  Yeah.  So we got Tarantino.  We got...  I don't know why we have a Justin Timberlake clip.  We'll make something out of it.  This is the buzz yesterday in the pop culture world.  You're bringing too much pop culture to our fucking show.  And he thinks it's the after show.  Yeah.  A lot of pop culture on that after show.  We're going to have to balance it out with some fucking child of the 80s shit.  That's right.  By the way, Roland...  Forgive me for keeping it young.  Roland said something on yesterday's show.  What was it? 
[01:04:00]  I have no fucking idea.  And I was so...  I was repeating what it sounded like in my car to myself driving home.  Can we pull it?  Trying to figure it out.  Can we pull it and we'll play it next?  I hope so.  I don't even know how to handle him on the after show anymore.  I don't know if I should be repeating him.  Because that kind of sounds like bad radio.  You just repeat everything Roland says.  He was slicing me.  It was like he was slicing me.  Can we find that?  Do you know about where it was?  God, I'm trying to think.  Yeah.  I mean, he didn't say that much on the show.  That's fine.  But even if it's a couple's second clip, it's worth it.  Yeah.  And of course, we're going to talk about the flu. 
[01:04:30]  Oh boy.  The flu.  We're going to talk about the flu.  Flu York City.  That's what the cover of the post says.  No, they did not do that.  That's what it says.  New York Post.  Flu York City.  The Opin памяти channel.  On Sirius XM.  We should do a montage of the first things we say when these mics go on.  We should do a montage of the first things of the first thing when these mics go on.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  We should do a montage.  Because even after all these years, it's just dumb little noises. 
[01:05:00]  Noises.  Noises  Noises  Noises  Noises  Noises  Make sure all the tones are there  Yeah, you gotta feel it out  Make sure all the tones are there  Yeah, you gotta feel it out  Get some lows  Get some highs  Get some lows 
[01:05:30]  Get some highs  Get some lows  Get some highs  Get some lows  Get some highs  Noises  Noises  Noises  Noises 
[01:06:00]  Noises  Noises  Noises  Noises  Noises  Noises  Noises  Noises  How we doin' this morning?  Let's do it  How we doin' this morning?  Let's do it  Get some slow 
[01:06:30]  Get some highs  Get some highs  Noises. Noises. Noises. Noises. Noises. Noises. 
[01:07:00]  Sirius XM, this is the OPN3 Show.  I'm the king of rock, there is none higher. Sucker MCs, you call me sire. To vote my kingdom, you must use fire. I won't stop rocking till I retire.  Damn. You like to run DMC?  Yes, good shit.  I like some of their stuff. Certainly this one.  And then the old Mary, Mary, why you bugging me? 
[01:07:30]  This is old school.  It really is.  Why the run DMC?  Because they're good.  Because they're good.  Damn.  Is Iraq funnier in the new year?  So far.  I think he's funnier in the new year.  I think he's funnier. I'm not sure if he means it. I don't think he said, I'm going to be funnier.  I think he said, I'm going to be meaner, or I'm going to try to, like, you know, get my shit in there and not be shit on as much. 
[01:08:00]  But it comes across as funny.  Did he make a New Year's resolution?  No.  Uh-oh.  I actually said, yuck, yuck, yuck to a guy at the gym.  Oh, really?  He was trying to do a little chit-chat, and he's like, you make the New Year's resolution?  I just went, yuck, yuck.  And then realized he meant it, and he wanted to tell me about his resolution.  And I'm just like, but the yuck kind of stopped the conversation.  That'll do it.  When you yuck somebody, when they say that, it pretty much ends the conversation. 
[01:08:30]  I didn't mean to.  He was just trying to be nice, which is very rare in New York City.  So I probably, I'm always on guard, I guess.  Uh-huh.  And I think New Year's resolutions are just so stupid.  Dumb.  Because I couldn't help myself.  Has anything ever really lasted from it?  Oh, yeah.  You've got to be conscious of that shit all year long.  Right.  It never works out.  Exactly.  E-Rock, so you didn't make a New Year's resolution?  No, because I'd never stick to it.  So why do I feel like you might be a little looser and funnier in the New Year? 
[01:09:00]  I don't know.  Not caring anymore.  Finally.  We finally beat him down to the point where he just doesn't care.  He's just drinking at work now.  Exactly.  Are you drinking at work?  Oh, I'd love to.  You would drink at work?  If I could, maybe.  You're not a big drinker, are you?  I'm getting there.  It's very funny in the New Year.  See, that timing was right there.  That's funny, man.  Fuck.  Well, there was an awkward moment on TV yesterday. 
[01:09:30]  What happened?  If I play this clip, does that mean we have to talk about guns for an hour?  Please tell me right now.  No.  Tell me right now.  I'm exhausted.  What am I prepared?  I've got to prepare myself.  Exhausted.  Because it's just a moment.  Yeah.  That I thought was kind of, you know, sort of funny.  I won't even.  But if you want to talk about guns, I just got to prepare myself.  I'm exhausted.  You good?  You good for now?  Nah.  Are you good?  I'm good. 
[01:10:00]  All right.  Because you had the Biden NRA thing yesterday.  And they had a gun debate going on on Fox News.  Yeah.  And this is what happened.  So a lot of these folks are playing off of naivety on the issue that, like I said, big, scary, you know, AR-15s, they look scary.  Yeah.  Therefore, they must be banned.  Without understanding the function behind them, that, I think, is where the debate can and should lie.  And folks that really understand it should be out there talking about it.  But to make it about hunting rifles, that's not what this is about. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Good debate, you guys.  Thank you for being here.  Discussion, I should say.  You bet.  Fox News alert now with breaking news from California.  Fox News just confirmed that there has been a school shooting in the city of California.  I got you.  And we didn't edit that.  That's exactly how it went down to Fox yesterday.  Fox News.  Wow.  Yeah.  Another fucking asshole, huh?  Yeah, I guess some student decided.  What was it, Taft Union High School out there in California? 
[01:11:00]  Taft.  I'm going to say it's about two hours north of Los Angeles.  Taft.  Yeah.  A little small town.  16-year-old.  Shotgun.  Anyone dead in this one?  I really don't know.  Nah, wounded.  Wounded?  Wounded.  Yeah, this doesn't seem like one of those, you know, guy with a maniacal purpose going  through and shooting people.  I don't know what it was.  Basically, yeah.  Just a cry for help.  Well, he said he was bullied.  Oh, he was bullied?  I think it's kind of hard to bully a kid in school these days. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, right.  There's such an awareness about it now.  His answer to bullying is shooting people?  I think that tops bullying.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, you would think.  Yeah.  So, I'm not going to go off, though.  I'm waiting.  I'm exhausted.  I swear.  I'm waiting.  I just want to see if you're a man of your word today.  I just have to take a breather from the gun argument during the show.  Maybe after the show, later on when I'm tweeting.  I'll get into it on Twitter a little bit. 
[01:12:00]  But, right now, let me give you some triggers.  I want to see how good you are.  Semi-automatic.  Yeah.  You good?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's, you know, forefathers.  I mean, forefathers.  Second Amendment.  Nothing?  No?  Loopholes.  Oh.  No? 
[01:12:30]  Did you see Piers Morgan last night?  Biden.  I see you're itching.  You're itching.  He debated some guy that just laid him out.  That kid was creepy, though.  He was.  See, I look at shit different than you.  I saw that as a creepy dude.  He was a little creepy.  His voice was too high.  He was so fucking creepy.  He was smirky.  But he was making some great points.  He looked like he could easily be part of Hitler's youth, too.  Ah, is that a bad thing?  I thought the guy was creepy.  I think he answered everything.  And I think he might have a little of that, uh... 
[01:13:00]  What, crazy?  I'll just call a little of that Bobo at him.  Oh, you think?  A little bit.  But it was the good kind, because he remembered a bunch of facts and figures.  He was like a fucking creepy robot.  See?  And he didn't just go with the company line.  He was able to say, no, I agree with you on that.  And when he agreed with Pierce on certain things, Pierce would, like, still start late into him.  He's like, hey, I'm agreeing with you.  There's a problem here.  But Pierce is so used to anybody on that side, you should just argue with them.  Pierce is like Pavlov's fucking English terrier. 
[01:13:30]  You're ready to jump in the pool.  No, no, I'm good.  You good?  I'm good.  I just thought he did a great job, and he should be recognized.  What was his name?  Ben Shapiro?  Yeah, he's...  Ben Shapiro.  He came across a little creepy to me.  I thought he came across great.  I don't think he has social skills.  I think he's robotic.  And Pierce took a lot of shit when he said, oh, and take your little book with you, and kind of, like, threw it. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, really?  And the guy goes, that little book is the Constitution.  Oops.  He handed Pierce the Constitution and said, why don't you read up on this?  And then later on in the broadcast, he goes, did you come in here with your little book?  And he threw it back to me.  He goes, that little book is the Constitution I'm talking about.  All right, your toes are in the pool.  Your toes are in the pool.  I'm backing out.  I'm backing out.  It's too chilly.  I'm backing out of the pool.  A well-armed militia.  Oh, jeez.  Well-regulated, but yes.  You all right?  Yes.  I'm good.  Okay.  This guy's making a lot of good points. 
[01:14:30]  I know, isn't he?  Walk away from the pool.  Go to the cabana.  There's a drink waiting for you.  Oh, I like drinks.  I know I could distract you with a nice drink.  Oh, a nice colorful beverage.  A nice colorful vodka beverage.  Yes.  Speaking of this whole issue, which I do believe, and I think Ant believes certainly, is that  it's a very complicated issue.  And it's not an easy one to figure out. 
[01:15:00]  Yes.  It's a lot of factors here.  And one of the things that bring it to the discussion is violence in movies and video  games.  This is what Biden is doing.  I guess today, yesterday, he met with the NRA.  That went nowhere.  It was pretty much just so Biden can say, hey, I met with the NRA.  Look at me.  I'm open to it.  And the NRA could say, hey, I met with the...  Yeah.  Well, the NRA put out a statement saying that it was just insane.  A waste of time.  Yeah.  A waste of time.  And now today, I guess he's meeting with video game people and going to discuss how we 
[01:15:30]  could curtail some of this violence.  Well...  Well, it's...  Like you've said in the past, Toby, how many video games are out there?  How many people play them?  And how many instances like this are attributed to video games?  Even if it was true that they were playing games and committing violence, it's such a  small number that it's inconsequential to video games.  And...  Yeah.  And what?  You're supposed to take away something that millions and millions of people enjoy because  every once in a while... 
[01:16:00]  Well, that seems to be the knee-jerk response in this country.  Take away from everybody because a few people do bad things with it.  But then, doesn't that hurt society more in the end?  I think so.  Yes.  Think about it.  I mean, it's never going to be perfect.  Yeah.  For some reason, we have this mentality in America and probably elsewhere that everything  has to be perfect.  Perfect.  And then you take away shit that people really fucking enjoy.  How can we get it so they're...  And once again, yeah, I'll bring it back to ourselves.  Radio is a great example.  Yeah.  They took a shitload of radio shows off the air. 
[01:16:30]  Because they want it to be perfect.  Right.  No offensive language that children might hear.  It's ridiculous.  If anyone thinks we're ever going to get to the point where there are no school shootings  ever, ever anymore, it won't happen.  There's always going to be tragedy and horrible things that happen.  Unless, of course, you want to just lock everyone up in separate rooms.  It's...  Yeah, there's a balance between our freedoms and our safety.  And they want to go way one way. 
[01:17:00]  And I just wish they would bring to the discussion, as far as violent video games and movies go,  the positive aspect of something like that.  It's an escape for a lot of people.  It's an escape.  I think it helps with your mind growth.  I think it helps with the eye-hand coordination, with figuring out things.  And also, I think, really, it does relieve a lot of stress in people.  Yeah.  It really does.  Makes a lot of stress with me.  I suck at it.  When I'm shooting somebody, as they come running at me and I'm missing, and then they hit me 
[01:17:30]  with a knife, I sit there and scream.  Right.  I scream it to myself.  Giving you more stress.  Yes.  I don't know.  There is a positive aspect to these games and these movies as well, but they don't want  to bring that up.  No.  And, of course, they never bring up the press and their contribution to this violence and  which taking these people and making anti-heroes of them.  Which I think is, you know, certainly does way more harm. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  I just saw something on TV that was stupid, so I got distracted.  Cool.  It was just some...  It's just insulation in an attic, and it fucking distracted me as I was trying to make my point.  It's an insulation commercial.  I looked up.  I looked up.  I was fucking...  His head tilted like a dog hearing a whistle.  I looked up, like...  Fascinated.  It's a commercial for Lowe's.  Who gives a fuck?  Oh, God.  Yeah.  I think the media is certainly causes, you know... 
[01:18:30]  It's at least something you can...  These kids do some shit.  It's at least something you can really look at and say, wow, you know something?  This has been looked at by psychiatrists and people that have said that, yes, they are  influenced by fame.  A lot of people want fame.  A lot of these people that kill people wanted some kind of fame.  You look at the guy that shot John Lennon.  You know, he wanted some kind of tie and some kind of fame for that.  So when you give them that fame, the next guy can look and go, oh, hey, all right, that 
[01:19:00]  worked for him.  Right.  Maybe I can do that.  Right.  More so than saying, oh, well, I play video games and because I shoot two-dimensional animated  things on a screen, it makes me want to do it in real life.  It drives me nuts because the media has openly admitted copycats.  Yes.  Across the board when it comes to things.  That absolutely this happened.  Yeah.  But they don't want to bring that into their own discussion.  Well, the point you brought up about in sports events, when the guy runs out on the fucking 
[01:19:30]  field.  A dumb, simple point.  Yes.  And they go and they take the camera.  They don't show him.  They go, well, there's a man on the field, but it's our policy not to show this.  We want to discourage that type of behavior.  They say that.  They're admitting.  Discourage that type of behavior.  They're admitting if they show it.  Right.  Other people might do it because they'll be like, well, I could get on camera.  Right.  It's a lower version of the fame.  Right.  And exposure on the news.  But it's the same thing.  And now we're back to the Aurora asshole. 
[01:20:00]  Aurora.  Aurora.  They're putting his face back on TV.  Yep.  Because he's in court now.  And there he is.  Getting everything he wanted.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So.  But today it's, they're going to talk about violence in movies.  Oh, no.  Violence in video games today?  Oh, this water's cold.  It's right around my thighs right now.  I'm feeling, ooh, a little chilly.  But, you know, some people say you should just dive right in.  No, no, no.  No?  No, no, no.  Please no.  Please do. 
[01:20:30]  I respect your passion, though.  I really do.  I respect anyone's passion for something.  Oh, my God.  Tarantino won't answer a British reporter's question on movie violence.  This is supposedly good.  I did not hear this one.  He's got to be sick of it at this point.  I mean, every interview he's doing, he wants to talk about his movie.  And all these, the press thinks they're these brilliant people with this brand new question of the tie-in between the violence in his film and violence in real life.  And the reason why I didn't hear this clip, I'm a little behind preparing for the radio show, 
[01:21:00]  because I'm completely addicted to Flow, I have to say.  Those progressive commercials are very good.  I enjoy her thoroughly.  The stupid fucking Flow app.  You can get it for the Droid, the iPhone.  You got me on it.  You got Flow.  You're in it.  Oh, man.  I see the people on Twitter.  They're getting addicted to this dumbest fucking game ever.  Maybe that's why I was fascinated by the Lowe's commercial.  Look at me.  Bring it all together.  I think I want to start getting some paint, and I want to make fucking lines, colorful lines around this building. 
[01:21:30]  I thought you were going to say when they rolled the insulation out, it's like when you're rolling the...  Yeah, when you're rolling the...  You know, that might have been it, too.  Might have been it.  You're like, oh, what are they blocking?  What are they blocking with that insulation?  I'm sitting at home going, I know I...  I hope that people understand we constantly try to prepare for this dumb radio show.  But I'm sitting there at home going, I know I should be looking at some websites or some news on TV, but I love this game.  Oh, but Flow.  I'm on the 9x9 boards.  9x9?  Yes.  9x9. 
[01:22:00]  And by the way, so far, perfect.  Perfect.  You're looking at the perfect guy.  Everything perfect?  Everything perfect.  All perfect everything?  See, you could complete the boards.  Yeah.  But if you do too many moves, they don't give you the perfect.  Yeah.  And in my OCD world, fuck that, I go back and make sure every single one of them has that star, which means perfect.  I got a lot of checks.  You want me to fix your checks?  You playing those games has to be exhausting.  Because you need everyone to be perfect. 
[01:22:30]  I acknowledge my wife.  That's why I don't really get into a lot of video games, because it's all consuming with me.  I have OCD in my family, and that's where it comes out.  And every once in a while, I get hit with one, and I'm all in for a while.  Tiger Woods, forget it.  I was all in for a long time, and now it's flow.  That's why I don't go searching out video games.  I know it could be a major problem with me.  I know.  You'd be one of those guys that, you know, they lose everything.  The marriage, the fucking thing, they're just sitting there playing games.  I'll be in in five minutes, hon.  Oh, in EverQuest? 
[01:23:00]  If I got into EverQuest or something like that, I would never be married with kids.  Crazy.  But I know.  So I kind of just avoid it as much as I can, but every once in a while, I get hit with one.  And right now, it's flow.  Flow has an end, right?  14 by, I'm hearing about 14 by 14 boards.  Oh my gosh.  I don't think there's an end.  They just make like new ones.  Oh, and here's the new one.  It's like Star Wars flow.  But then these idiots are trying to turn me on to a new drug called bridges or something.  It's flow, but it's bridges, if that makes sense. 
[01:23:30]  I don't know.  It doesn't make sense to me.  Is that the game where you're going to speak to Jay Thomas?  Flame on!  It's so much easier to go through life with fucking bridges built.  Bridges?  You starting to learn that?  I'm exhausted.  It's very, you know something?  I've run out of dynamite, I think.  You're right.  Because even in real life, it's easier to cross torrent waters.  Yeah.  Torrential waters with bridges, Hopi.  Swimming is hard.  Swimming's hard.  It's dangerous.  Driving is easy. 
[01:24:00]  Setting up the TNT to fucking blow up these bridges.  When you see a bridge, you just go, oh, I'm going to cross the bridge.  Right.  Great.  Homeland now has to talk to me.  Fuck.  Oh, boy.  I don't mean actual bridges.  Not for that.  Oh.  Quentin Tarantino, movie violence.  Good for Tarantino.  He's fucking had it.  It's a fantasy.  You go and you watch a kung fu movie, and one guy takes on 100 people in a restaurant.  That's fun.  But why are you so sure that there's no link between enjoying movie violence and enjoying 
[01:24:30]  real violence?  I hate that accent.  I'm going to pause there.  I'm not sure there is a link.  There might be a link.  Oh, you think there might be?  Maybe it's the whole formula.  It's like, he's a fucking asshole.  He's on a couple drugs.  He plays.  I don't know.  But unfortunately, when you have a society, we've said it over the years as a joke,  but not all the fucking baby turtles are going to make it to the ocean.  You're always going to have someone fall into the cracks.  And I agree with you on this point, that there's no way to say if it is an influence 
[01:25:00]  or not.  But I will guarantee this.  If you take a theater full of sane people, sane, perfectly fine, live their life every  day.  They all have guns?  No.  Not a gun in the place.  How close are you to the pool right now?  Oh, I'm back out.  I'm back out.  You're on your beach chair?  Yes.  I'm on the chair.  I'm sunning.  I'm feeling the sun.  I got a nice...  You got your droid in the air?  I see cold.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:25:30]  I got a...  You're staying away from...  Everything's fine.  You're far from the pool.  Far from the pool.  All right, continue, sir.  Sorry.  Not even in it.  Sorry to interrupt.  And if you get sane people that watch a violent movie, none of them are going to go out and  commit violence based on the movie.  If you get someone that is already crazy, that has this, you know, predetermination to  violence or something, maybe they would be influenced by a movie.  They'd see something and go, wow, that'd be a great way to kill someone.  And since I've wanted to kill someone anyway, maybe in that case, you can't then take away 
[01:26:00]  everything that normal people can deal with and find fun or entertaining or protective  or whatever it is, and base taking it away from them on the fact that a few people are  going to be crazy and, you know, use it for bad.  If you went on CNN with that, you'd be on every blog as a crazy person.  Oh, as a nut.  But that is the truth.  Because I think it would do more harm to society taking all this shit away from them. 
[01:26:30]  Right.  I mean, crazy people are always going to be influenced by something.  It could be a reflection in a teapot is a little fucking distorted, and I got to kill  everybody.  What percentage will society be happy with?  Because, I mean, if you really do the percentages on this.  It's low.  Let's say there is a kid every once in a while that is influenced by a violent video game  or a violent movie.  And I'm being serious.  I'm not sure if there is a lake.  I'm not sure.  Right.  But the percentage would be so astronomical.  Mm-hmm.  It would be, it's not even close to 1%. 
[01:27:00]  Exactly.  It's 1% of 1%, maybe.  Yep.  The number would be ridiculous to look at.  So then what are you supposed to do?  Because it happened once or twice, then you have to make sure every movie is, what?  Well, again, they're going...  Violent free?  They're going for that perfect record of 0% incidents happening.  It's not going to happen.  But every time something does happen, people feel like they need to do something about it.  Right.  And it usually means curtailing something from people that can handle it. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, where's my snorkel?  Oh, no, no, no.  I want...  Uh-oh.  No, no, no, no, no.  Did you see my snorkel around and the mask?  Because I...  No, they're putting chlorine in the pool.  It's dangerous right now.  Too many chemicals.  You've got to wait a few hours.  Oh, well, I did just eat.  Yeah.  I should wait an hour.  Yeah.  And I think somebody's shit.  They're cleaning that up.  So I sit in the pool right now.  Yeah, there's a...  Jesus Christ.  There's a turd in the pool.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  There's a turd in there right now.  No, that's Logan.  They'll get it.  You had someone shit in your pool?  No, no, no.  I bet it now I can guess.  I had a certain person in my pool. 
[01:28:00]  You didn't have to even clarify it that much.  Of course.  The...  The...  No, just the guy.  Is he a...  Poor Logan.  Complexion-based jokes.  He's one of...  He's actually had to take over for Patrice.  I need a black friend at my house that comes over the house, can go in the pool.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  A nice guy, yes.  That would be really close.  A nice guy.  You only have nice people around.  Of course. 
[01:28:30]  I don't know.  You think DJ Who Kid would come over my house?  Yeah, he would.  He would love your house.  Logan would be out.  Out.  He'd bring some bitches, too.  Would he bring some bitches?  Who Kid would actually supply...  Absolutely supply bitches.  And I know for a fact they ain't gonna be fucking sisters, either.  No.  Because that motherfucker is into white bitching.  He clarified that.  Yo, nigga, what up?  Oh.  Let's hope he's greeting.  He's my pal.  Yeah.  I feel like I could say that to my pals.  Well, he's so.  Drew, I'm not sure if I could say that to you.  Are we pals?  Drew Boogie's in studio.  Hi.  Are we pals? 
[01:29:00]  Can I say that to you?  Not after that.  We're pals.  Huh?  I don't see why not.  Nice.  Yo, nigga, what up?  Oh, damn.  There you go.  I just said it.  There you go.  Drew was over for the big New Year's Eve party.  It was a lot of fun, man.  Was it good?  It was a great time.  Yeah.  Did have a pip.  A pip of a time.  A lot of karaoke on that night.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Everybody was singing.  It was crazy.  Yeah.  Hmm.  Someone is saying Flow Bridges is the way to go.  Flow Bridges?  I can't get involved with Flow Bridges. 
[01:29:30]  That's crazy.  I'll stick with Flow, and then when that's over, I think I can tap out for a while.  Until the next dumb thing.  Flow Bridges?  That, I would assume.  Like, I was Angry Birds guy.  That was my last one.  That's all.  So, in between, there's been a bunch of games people have jumped on.  I bet Flow Bridges, you can go through the lines over certain bridges.  Yeah.  Is that it?  What do you mean?  Like, you could use a bridge to go, so you don't have to go through lines.  This is my weakness.  Like, the pool thing.  Oh, boy.  Wait.  Let me at least look at it.  Let me just see what it looks like.  Those Flow Bridges.  That's not Flow Bridges, is it?  Yeah.  You see the green thing? 
[01:30:00]  Oh, oh.  So, what does that mean?  You can go over the line.  Your line can go through there.  Oh.  All right.  Oh.  See that motherfucker right there?  They give you little fucking bridges.  That seems easier.  Now you're going under the green bridge.  That seems easier, though.  To get to the other blue dot.  It's easy, because that's a four-by-four board.  It's a retard board right there.  Now, do that with the nine-by-nine board.  You have to be a fucking asshole not to figure out four-by-four.  Fuck, right?  My kid plays Flow.  Really?  Really good at the five-by-fives.  You know how I knew it was a problem in your house? 
[01:30:30]  Why?  Because I was driving home with Jess last night.  She was driving, and she was like, what are you doing on your phone?  And I was like, I'm playing Flow.  She was like, what's Flow?  And I said, it's this game.  And she said, that's the game Opie's kid wanted me to play last time I was over there.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  He's good with the five-by-five boards.  Yeah, he's playing the Flow.  Yeah, it's pretty five-by-five, like Sam said.  But if you can't figure out the five-by-five, forget it.  I didn't ask her what she was doing at Opie's house.  But that's like a good drug dealer, man. 
[01:31:00]  They give you the nice taste, the five-by-five.  It's like, yeah, I can handle the five-by-five.  Sure.  And you get to seven, eights, nines.  You're like, what did I get myself into?  I'm fucking jonesing.  Let's start the Tarantino clip over again.  Yes.  We'll shut our fucking yaps.  Let's see what's been said.  It's a fantasy.  You go and you watch a kung fu movie, and one guy takes on 100 people in a restaurant.  That's fun.  But why are you so sure that there's no link between enjoying movie violence and enjoying real violence? 
[01:31:30]  I don't...  I'm going to tell you why I'm so sure.  Do not ask me a question like that.  I'm not biting.  I refuse your question.  Why?  Because I refuse your question.  I'm not your slave, and you're not my master.  You can't make me dance to your tune.  I'm not a monkey.  I can't make you answer anything.  I'm just asking you interesting questions.  And I'm saying I refuse.  Okay.  Well, no, I was just asking you why.  That's fine.  But you see, Jamie...  Wow.  Good for the fucking Tarantino as a rock star.  Yeah, yeah, good.  Yeah.  Good for him.  Fine. 
[01:32:00]  But you see, Jamie Foxx has said, we can't turn our back and say that violence in film...  Well, then you should talk to Jamie Foxx about that.  And I think he's actually here, so you can.  I'd love to.  But, I mean, it's interesting that you have a different view, and I'm just trying to explore that.  And I don't want to.  Because I'm here to sell my movie.  This is a commercial for the movie.  Make no mistake.  Well, you don't want to...  Yeah, yeah.  So you don't want to talk about anything serious?  I don't want to talk about what you want to talk about.  I don't want to talk about the implications of violence. 
[01:32:30]  I haven't wanted...  Because, you know, the reason I don't want to talk about it is I've said everything I have to say about it.  If anyone cares what I have to say about it, they can Google me.  And they can look for 20 years what I have to say of it.  I haven't changed my opinion one iota.  No, but you haven't fleshed it out.  It's not my job to flesh it out.  No, it's my job to try and ask you to.  And I'm shutting your butt down.  And that's entirely your right.  This is a commercial from my movie. 
[01:33:00]  Good for him.  Because they're just a bunch of dopes.  They all want the new angle.  Right.  They're just a bunch of dopes.  I'll get you to touch with him.  Yes.  The violence.  The movie violence.  They all play Follow the Leader.  One person somewhere said, ah, violence in movies.  And now they all just go with it instead of using their own fucking brains.  They think they are so clever.  Look, you don't have to agree with what we're saying.  But we have a different take on it that you just don't hear anywhere else.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:33:30]  I don't hear anyone else say that there is a positive thing that comes out with watching violent movies and playing violent videos.  No.  Never.  Because that would be crazy to say, right?  It's insanity.  By the way.  It's called escapism, which is a very good thing for society.  Society.  Society.  By the way, I just saw the breakfast order, I gather, go into shade 45.  Mm-hmm.  It looked like the box that shows up at a job site when the guy does that. 
[01:34:00]  What the fuck is going on in there?  They know how to eat.  Dude, it's a giant box with coffees and things.  How many people are in there?  There's Sway, there's a couple of ladies, there's a DJ, there's a board op.  Do they have a DJ in there?  DJ Wonder.  What does he do?  He DJs.  They've got turntables in there.  What?  So he's DJing in and out of spots and stuff?  Like we have Drew Boogie do?  Yeah, they've got a DJ out in the back of the studio.  He does.  Yeah, they've always had it.  He does sets.  Like every morning, there's a...  Is it like, yo, MTV raps?  I mean, no. 
[01:34:30]  I would say.  I guess not.  Why?  I don't know what the correlation, except black people.  Because they used to do that type of stuff.  Yeah, yeah.  Yo, MTV raps.  No, they do like, you know, an hour set every morning.  An hour set?  Why can't we do that?  We're not a music channel.  Drew Boogie has set his stuff up, and we can fucking...  When is the hour set?  I think at 10.  They get in at 8.  That's part of the morning show.  Jesus Christ.  Sway only has to do two hours?  Why are we the only show that has to fucking break our hump around here? 
[01:35:00]  Because you're the fucking assholes who decided, let's do a talk channel.  Ooh.  As opposed to like jumping on a music channel and being like,  Yay, it's Sway, here's some rap music.  And your agent's not that good.  Oh, E-Rock.  Can't argue with that.  Well, E-Rock.  It's an E-Rock's agent, too.  How's your agent, E-Rock?  Um, Solo.  Ah, that's right.  Dolo?  What is that?  Yolo?  Rolo.  I love Rolos.  Rolo's the best.  Rolo.  Rolo.  No, I know, but it's my job to try and explore some serious things as well. 
[01:35:30]  I'm sure.  Well, I invite you to explore some serious things, but not things that I have already been on the record for talking about.  Well, violence is such a big part of all of your movies, and it's, you know, and it's an enjoyable part of your movies for so many people.  And that...  All right.  There's a couple things there.  It's enjoyable.  It's not fair to that guy, because we get that same situation where we ask, uh, and I love Quentin Tarantino.  I'm absolutely in his camp in general with this whole thing.  Yeah.  But we've had celebrities come in, and it's the first time and maybe the last time we'll ever talk to them, so we will bring up some old shit. 
[01:36:00]  Uh-huh.  And they get mad at us, and it's like, yeah, but we've never heard, and, you know, we're exploring it here today.  Yeah, all right, that's true.  But, I don't know.  There's something else in there, but...  I'm distracted.  I'm thinking about this float board.  I think I got the fucking answer.  Oh.  Because then I work it out in my head.  I know where all the fucking dots are right now.  That's a little weird.  That's sad, actually.  I think if I split the red dots to get to the other yellow dot, I think that's what's going to open up that fucking board. 
[01:36:30]  Oh.  When do we go to break?  I've got to try this.  Oh.  It just shouldn't be in your brain like that.  It shouldn't take up that kind of space.  ...movies, and it's, you know, and it's an enjoyable part of your movies for so many people, and that's why I'm talking about this, because, you know, it's a very sensitive time at the moment.  I mean, the vice president is talking to people in the movie industry today about violence in response to the...  But you know where I stand on it.  ...which is that there's no relationship.  Yes.  But you haven't said why you think there's no relationship.  It's none of your damn business what I think about that. 
[01:37:00]  Oh.  Well, it's my job to ask you why you think that.  And I'm saying no.  Because you're very influential.  And I'm shutting you down.  But you have a responsibility as a filmmaker, surely, to explain a little bit about...  No, I don't have any responsibility to you to explain anything I don't want to.  Not to me, but to your viewers, to your fans.  No, to nobody.  To people who care about what it is that you're doing.  They know where I'm coming from.  Yep.  And I have explained it.  And I have explained even what you're talking about. 
[01:37:30]  I'm just not giving it to you.  Why?  Because I don't want to, because I've done it already.  I have explained this many times in the last 20 years.  I just refuse to repeat myself over and over again, because you want me to.  For you and your show.  Your...  And your ratings.  Well, no, it's not about our ratings.  It's...  No, no, it is.  It is about you want me to say it for you.  Right.  For your show.  This show.  Right here.  Right now.  Well, look, this is a news program.  It's not a film program, so we explore serious themes.  That's the difference.  Exactly.  Yeah. 
[01:38:00]  But you want me to do what I've already done before, and I am refusing.  Fine.  That's your right.  Tarantino's frustrated, because the guy is not prepared whatsoever, because the violence  in his movies...  Yeah.  He makes violence in a weird way fun.  It is really kind of...  Cartoon-y.  Almost cartoon-y, yeah.  Yeah.  You laugh during some of the craziest fucking blood scenes that he's had in movies.  Get off.  He does it very differently than other filmmakers.  It's creative.  It's definitely needed for the film.  Right.  Yeah, and as a filmmaker, he doesn't have a responsibility to anything except making 
[01:38:30]  a film.  Right.  Making a fucking film that he wants to make.  That's the only responsibility a filmmaker has, like any other artist.  You don't have any responsibility to the people.  Where did that fucking come from, by the way?  That because you do something, and do it well, you then are responsible for how it's going  to affect people.  Broadcasters.  Fuck you.  Somewhere along the line, supposedly we're supposed to have a responsibility. 
[01:39:00]  Why?  Yeah, of course.  We've been told that.  In the end, we're just trying to entertain people.  You have...  I've heard that plenty of times.  You have a responsibility.  When you go saying things like that on the air, and people listen, you have a responsibility...  Fucking...  Go fuck yourself.  I have a responsibility to get on this mic and yap about whatever the fuck I want.  And other people that are listening have the responsibility to decipher it however they  fucking damn well please.  And decide if they want to listen to this horse shit.  It's called free will, fuckers. 
[01:39:30]  I mean, I will never give up on the Imus nappy-headed hoe thing.  Completely amazed that Reverend Al got him kicked off MSNBC and fired from...  CBS, right?  He has a responsibility.  Because he was supposed to have a responsibility that day when all he was fucking doing was  trying to entertain his audience that decided a long time ago that this is the type of program  they want to listen to?  Yeah.  And Reverend Al had that much power to get him kicked off the fucking radio and TV? 
[01:40:00]  What about Reverend Al?  Oh, boy.  We should run Reverend Al out of town with fucking pitchforks and fucking torches.  People have tried.  Get him the fuck out of here.  He is literally the cockroach of New York, man.  He's a piece of shit for getting that done.  He can't fucking ever be called out on anything.  Ever leave.  I'm proud of this show because we call him out all the time on it.  And then he was breathing down our stupid necks.  And then XM had to make some weird backroom deal to save us. 
[01:40:30]  Oh, right.  With Reverend Al.  Reverend Al.  He was breathing heavily down our fucking backs.  And then they basically, I'll tell you, they gave him a fucking show for a while to calm  him down.  That they wouldn't give him if he continued breathing down our backs.  What was that?  The Connelly's or...  I don't even know.  Was it that one?  What was the fucking Homeless Charlie guy spouting off like a homeless guy does?  All of a sudden, he's calling and asking questions.  We are outraged. 
[01:41:00]  Excuse me.  I'm not quite as outraged as I could be.  That was the brilliance of Eric Logan.  He calmed him down by fucking, you know, putting a shiny object in front of his face.  You know, a fucking, some time on the radio.  Motherfucker.  Fuck him.  Fuck you.  Broadcasters don't have responsibility.  Filmmakers don't have a responsibility.  No.  The marketplace will decide.  That's something people have forgotten.  They want to, like, you know, it's a prime example is the ESPN fucking. 
[01:41:30]  Apology before anyone was even outraged.  Apology.  About Brent Musburger.  I mean, that's where we're living right now.  That's where we're living.  Apologize.  For what?  I don't know.  Just apologize.  That's their whole logic.  Brent Musburger calls a beautiful woman beautiful.  She's a beauty contest contestant.  And he calls her beautiful.  ESPN freaks out and apologizes when no one was complaining.  No one uttered a word. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, I don't.  I know these people here don't have my fucking back.  No.  We learned the hard way over the years.  Yeah.  These guys don't have our back.  Ah, you're a fucking mother.  It'd be great if just one lousy company and one lousy boss would stick up for their talent.  Because they know this is hard.  They don't.  They know at any moment we could say something stupid.  Any moment?  Well, you know.  At any moment we might not say something stupid.  But that one fucking thing, that'll go viral and cause a ruckus. 
[01:42:30]  They know it.  It's not easy to do this.  You can fuck up at any moment.  We fucked up three or four times in our careers.  Cost us our jobs twice.  Yes, it did.  I remember that.  Wasn't fun.  Nah.  All right.  Bob Kelly's coming in.  David Duchovny's coming in.  We got some...  I don't even want to promote it because then it's a dial changer. 
[01:43:00]  The name's a dial changer.  Yeah.  But what you brought to me I hear is really good.  It is funny.  I re-listened to it.  You don't like it.  It's funny.  All right.  So I'm not going to say what it is.  Right.  Because people get the wrong impression.  Yeah.  I want them to have an open mind.  Good.  So don't fucking change the dial.  It's going to be awesome.  What else is going on?  Anything else?  Justin Timberlake?  Do we really have to play that?  You don't have to, but it's what the kids are talking about.  What is it?  Everybody was buzzing because they thought he was going to put out a new song yesterday.  Uh-huh.  It's been like however many years since he put any music out.  No shit. 
[01:43:30]  Ever since that Come in a Box song or whatever the fuck it was?  That wasn't one of his songs.  That was his last song.  That was an SNL parody.  Yeah, that's his last song, though.  Look it up.  Come in a Box.  His last song was Come in a Box.  No, it wasn't.  He did a morning show parody song.  Yes.  That was his last big hit, Come in a Box.  Instead of putting out a song, he put out a teaser video.  Why would we play this?  I need to know. 
[01:44:00]  Because that's what the kids are talking about.  You know who I bet is playing it?  Mash-ups.  Exactly.  The mash-up.  Now we have to play it, I think.  The kids are talking about this.  The streets is talking.  See what I just did there?  I know these people.  You bring up something they then need to hear.  It's the easiest thing to do in radio.  Because no one would give a fuck about a Justin Doolittle.  No one cares.  Just bringing it up and give it a little something-something that everybody needs to hear. 
[01:44:30]  Wait, but what is that?  And then they're going to be mad with themselves.  Like, fuck, I had to hear it.  And of course it's not.  Why didn't you play it?  I love the mic falls.  I love these mics.  These cheap fucking mics.  Oh, they're so cheap.  I had better mics than college radio.  What happened?  It's just a matter of time.  I'm going to be podcasting like the rest of the assholes.  This is the Opie Anthony Channel.  From Sirius XM. 
[01:45:00]  What's that?  Can we interview you for Chippa TV?  It's talking to people at Comic-Cons.  What's your hat supposed to be?  Supposed to be the mushroom head for Toad.  The mushroom?  Uh-oh.  Like magic mushrooms?  Like you're going to get zooted or something?  Yeah, or magic brownies, right?  I got so fucked up one time.  I was smoking reefers and doing Mary Janes and whatnot.  And my friend's like, you want to do mushrooms? 
[01:45:30]  I'm like, fuck that shit.  No, it's just at that point, you're just like, no, maybe later.  Yeah, I get too zooted.  I just get fucking crazy, you know?  Fucking throw shit at the cops and whatnot.  I don't give a fuck.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Makes sense, yeah.  So, how's your Comic-Con?  So far, so good.  I'm trying to meet girls, make friends.  Where's your boyfriend?  I don't have a boyfriend.  Oh, that's nice.  You want to go out for some pea soup or something?  I got to go meet up with my cousin.  She's an artist.  What the fuck?  She's an artist here. 
[01:46:00]  Damn it.  Where are you from?  I live in France.  Oh, what brings you here from France?  Oh my God, look at that guy's bulge.  That's the biggest pecker I've ever seen.  I like you.  Where's your boyfriend?  Oh, he's walking around here somewhere.  Shit.  I got to go before he gets mad.  I thought I was going to get that, too.  God damn it.  I can't get no puss here.  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Yeah.  Fucking home run, Chipperson. 
[01:46:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show presents Lessons in Understanding with Andrew Dice Clay.  I'm going, this motherfucker, Fran Sucked Dick, I call her.  I want to take pictures with just all the guy comics.  You know, she's like jumping in there.  I'm going, no, just the guys, right?  I just want the guys.  And then I'm calling her over, and this classless piece of fucking shit that talks like a fucking truck driver is giving me the fingers.  I'm going, number one, I don't like girl comics. 
[01:47:00]  I like girl comics that are fucking funny.  I can't help that this motherfucker is talentless, okay?  That is not my problem.  I just hate the ones that fucking stink at what they fucking do.  And she's fucking awful, and I think she's a scumbag for fucking with me.  How about you stay home and actually raise the fucking babe you have, rather than trying out for a fucking Tampax commercial, you dumb fuck.  I'm telling you, honestly, I know her.  She's joking.  That's not real. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, then my mistake.  This has been Lessons in Understanding with Andrew Dice Clay.  Serious XM, the Opie and Anthony Show.  I want to fuck your body.  Is this to come into the box song?  I think he said rock your body.  Oh.  This is the lyric.  Is this, are you playing this because it's good too, E-Rock? 
[01:48:00]  What guy is he singing about in this song?  Oh.  I think it might be, I think he's heterosexual.  An implication there.  As a matter of fact, I believe he's married to Jessica Biel.  All right, now I know.  You didn't know.  What the fuck do I know?  I mean, I thought that was fairly public knowledge.  He married her?  Yeah, he did.  He married who?  Jessica Biel.  Who is she?  Who is she?  Biel.  Mm, mm, mm.  Yeah.  Is she one of those Hollywood starlets?  Yeah.  Piece of age.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we're just kind of stopping.  Were you just looking at every bit of her up and down?  Sam popped a picture up of her in a bikini, and we just stopped talking.  We're like, yeah, I gotta look.  I felt like we were walking to the sushi joint back in the NAW days.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, we stopped talking, but a certain individual we were with would not stop talking.  Oh, yeah.  Because this certain individual didn't notice what we just noticed on the streets of New York.  Oh, I remember that.  If you know what I'm saying, yeah. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  I get it.  All right.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  That's kind of pretty.  So, Justin Timberlake made a video, and it's all the buzz on Twitter right now.  The kids are all over this shit.  Someone asked me the other day.  Come on.  If you didn't know.  Come on.  Come on.  What would your first thought be?  That's all I'm saying.  He's a fashionable guy.  Listen. 
[01:49:30]  Someone asked me the other day.  Someone asked me the other day.  If you didn't tell me, I would say, next time bring this to me, we have to guess who it is.  Okay.  I would have guessed Clay Aiken.  I like Jessica Biel's tits.  He sounds like AJ Poopy Shits.  AJ Poopy Shits.  Or his brother, Sal.  Yeah.  True.  Sal.  Sal Poopy Shits.  Yes.  Sal.  So, I didn't come with her.  What's the big deal? 
[01:50:00]  Sal.  Hits weren't good enough.  Eek.  Someone asked me the other day.  So, are you just done with music?  Oh.  I thought, you know, done with pussy.  That question.  Huh?  Someone asked me the other day.  Do you like cock?  Come on.  I know.  You would think you're listening to a gay guy.  Of course you would.  You could say that, right, Sam?  You could.  It's a stereotypical thing, but you could say that it's associated with the stereotype. 
[01:50:30]  He has the gay voice.  Linger longer.  Could have been the smartest person to ever do our radio show.  Boy, were we wrong, right?  It means more to me than anybody else in the world.  Look, I've only done two albums in ten years.  That's the way I really look at it.  What does the next decade mean for me?  I'm the one who sits and is obsessive about it before you use it.  This sounds like he's talking about, like he's working at Jet Propulsion Laboratories 
[01:51:00]  and talking about a rocket going to fucking Mars or something.  We're talking about his dumb pop music.  Right.  Yeah.  Cares that he's put out two albums in ten years.  Who gives a fuck?  Cares if he's got another album he wants to put out.  The only reason you put out two albums in ten years is because you don't have enough shit.  Eh, that's all.  Or you're having sex with gorgeous women to cover up for fucking something that's very obvious.  Well, we can't, I don't know.  I can say that. 
[01:51:30]  You can say that?  Oh, you can say he's covering up for something so obvious by fucking beautiful women.  I feel like, yeah, we're listening to like someone on Broadway.  Yes.  When I got one of the leads in Chicago, I couldn't have been happier.  I had just come off of doing Rent, and it was fabulous.  ...about it before you needed to hear it.  Jesus. 
[01:52:00]  As close as I get to it, I don't know that I can physically torture myself that much year.  It makes Fez sound masculine.  Hey!  My God, man!  Hey!  I physically deal with...  He is making putting an album out sound like fucking the most amazing, hardest thing ever.  Right.  ...but I don't know that I could physically torture myself that much year in and year out.  Hello, exactly!  ...and expect it to fulfill me the way that it does and the way that it is right now. 
[01:52:30]  Fulfill.  With jizz.  I don't want to put anything out that I feel like is something I don't love.  You just don't get that every day.  Ugh.  You have to wait for it.  I'm ready.  And then he says, I'm ready?  And he steps in the studio and puts headphones on.  Oh, my God!  And I'm going to tell you guys something else.  Yeah?  Somewhere along the line... 
[01:53:00]  Yeah.  ...it became cool and okay for guys to be into Justin Timberlake.  When did that happen?  I don't know.  And by guys, you mean...  No.  Oh, what?  What are you talking about?  Men...  Why are we still talking about them?  Ha!  Ha!  Why are we even...  Hey, I respect you, but aren't we done with them?  Men...  Like, half of the tweets and the Facebook messages and stuff?  Yeah.  They're dudes.  Really?  They can't wait for the next Justin Timberlake song? 
[01:53:30]  Yes!  Stop it!  That's because of the Come in the Box song.  Yeah.  He gets the Come in the Box?  Of course it is.  And are you sure that's the title?  That type of song, yes.  Come in the Box.  That was like a guy song, so that probably brought a lot of guy fans to him, I would assume.  But...  I'm telling you, his music is accepted by men.  No.  Because of that song.  Not me.  This from the guy that wears the Lady Gaga shirt, by the way.  True.  Can't help it.  I'm a little monster.  I was born this way.  If you want to bully me, be a bully. 
[01:54:00]  But whatever.  He's got the line.  Yes.  The old company line for the gags.  Is she still a fat fucking slob?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Or did she...  No, that's her shit now.  Is she gaining more weight?  Yeah.  On purpose?  Let me see what she looks like right now.  Holy fat fuck.  Really?  Yeah.  She continued to gain weight, huh?  Where is she?  I'm here to fall in my way.  That's an old picture.  That's not what her...  Is that old?  No, that is old.  Last time we talked about her, we showed that picture. 
[01:54:30]  And that's a while ago now.  Yeah, these are all the old pictures.  There's no...  All right.  But she is still going with the fat thing?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She knows how to market herself.  Because she's thinking, if I'm fat, you know, then I can get the fat chicks listening.  Especially yourself, yourself, yourself.  So maybe we should gain weight.  What?  No, because you are the bully.  You can't go and say, I'm fat, don't bully me. 
[01:55:00]  What's that picture all the way to the right?  This one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ew.  Yeah.  She stinks.  She's fucking lumpy.  Jimmy thinks she's good, man.  In a video, she could look good in a couple of her videos.  That's really her?  That's a horrendous picture of her.  Terrible.  Yeah, there's some bad pictures of her, but I've seen some really good pictures of her.  I think when she's made up, like, she would never, like, be made up.  She looks good in certain videos.  She's not good looking at all.  I think she is.  No.  She knows how to, like, dress good looking, if that makes sense. 
[01:55:30]  She doesn't look bad.  Like, she'll wear the big, huge sunglasses to...  Yes!  ...bounce out her weird fucking nose.  Oh, boy.  She's got a horrible nose.  She's very talented.  Ugly, ugly.  Ugly as fuck.  Yeah, people are...  Nah, she's not appreciating her.  Jimmy is all about it, though.  That's it.  But Jimmy's not here to defend himself, so...  Jimmy has said...  Oh, in the red.  In the red.  Lower left.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, look at that.  That's awful, dude.  It's not a good photo.  By the way, Jim Norton's at Zanies in Nashville. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  To all our Nashville pals, go see Jim Norton.  That would be great.  It would make his day.  It would make his night.  Oh, when I woke up for that short period of time last night...  You got the text?  No, I decided to do something creative and constructive.  Yes.  So I trolled Michaela Maroney's Instagram.  And I put a couple of comments on it.  It was like, wow, she's getting fat.  She better have...  A loved one better tell her to lose weight. 
[01:56:30]  And, oh, boy.  What did that cause?  Oh, you're disgusting.  Fuck you.  She's beautiful.  And I said something like, all I'm saying is she's getting fat.  And everyone knows fat people aren't pretty.  Right.  Oh, wow.  And you get, like, all these youngsters that follow Michaela Maroney.  And they're like, people that are overweight can be pretty, too.  And skinny people are pretty.  Everyone's beautiful.  It's...  I was like, oh.  So I just...  Yeah, that's what I did until I fell back asleep. 
[01:57:00]  It's great, though.  You can't beat trolling teens.  A little girl like her, she gains a pound.  That's like a normal girl gaining 20.  Dude.  Yeah.  Because she's a little...  Pixie.  Pixie?  Yeah, Pixie.  A pipsqueak.  A pipsqueak.  I saw a picture of her from yesterday.  She looked like she was putting on a couple of pounds, let's just say.  Nothing worse than seeing...  Not on her Instagram, was it?  Yeah, it was on her Instagram.  It was?  Yeah.  Nothing worse than seeing an Olympic gymnast four years later. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, God.  Right?  They do some guest announcing or something.  You know why?  They are in the peak of their shape during the Olympics.  Of course.  So they can go nowhere but down from that.  They're at the absolute peak.  Go to...  Scroll down.  How tall is she?  She is three feet tall.  I thought she was short.  Yeah.  Where's that other picture of her that maybe it wasn't on her Instagram?  She was posing.  She...  No, not that.  No, she's...  You know...  Is she sick of making that face by now?  She must be. 
[01:58:00]  The only time I want to see her make that face is if she's swishing my jizz back and forth  in her mouth.  Wow.  How dare you.  Where did that come from?  Right here.  Right here.  From me.  Right now.  Right here.  Yeah.  She loves pictures of herself, though.  Selfies, they're called.  Those face shots.  Look how many there are.  They're all peppered in there.  Where every day you could at least get two of those fucking full face shots of Michaela  Maroney.  Girls in love with their self.  Selfies is the right term.  Selfies. 
[01:58:30]  See, I want to talk to the kids today.  They're called selfies.  Are you talking to the kids?  I tried a selfie once, and then someone had a right...  Oh, you look sick!  Haven't done selfies since.  You look sick!  It's a joke, by the way.  AIDS!  Oh, yeah.  Great.  Right.  AIDS.  Nothing better than guys commenting about how I look.  All the guys.  Freaks me the fuck out.  Guys love commenting.  A lot of men have told me I'm unattractive. 
[01:59:00]  Right.  I get it all the time.  It's wonderful.  Oh, you're not as good looking as they say you were on the show.  Yeah.  Why do you care?  Ugh.  Sir?  Un-fucking-believable.  Nice working out.  Doesn't seem to be working for you, Anthony.  Oh, what?  My body isn't up to your fucking standards?  Really?  If it was, you know, one of our lady listeners, it would be heartbreaking.  You kind of go like, ah, fuck, man.  But consider the source.  I'm like, why do you give a fuck? 
[01:59:30]  99.9% of the time.  What I look like, you're a guy.  It's a fucking dude.  It's creepy.  Dude.  AIDS.  I'll be honest.  There was a time I found it exhausting, but now it's just like, when you realize it's  the culture we live in now, you just gotta enjoy it.  It's so stupid.  It's hilarious.  Oh, man.  So, um, we should talk about the Academy Awards. 
[02:00:00]  Definitely.  I mean, you want to talk about topical.  Did you see what Helen Hunt looks like these days?  No.  Because she's, uh, I guess she's nominated for being a sex surrogate.  Does she have a forehead like, uh, those African women?  You know, here's the...  The hairline starts, like, at the back of their head.  She doesn't look like that.  What is that?  She looks pretty good there.  Oh, my God, really?  She doesn't look like any of those pictures you're showing me.  Oh, whoa.  Nope.  She even looks worse than that.  Whoa.  She looks horrible.  What's going on?  And she wasn't...  She wasn't a bad-looking, uh, lesbian when she was younger. 
[02:00:30]  Is she a lesbian?  Oh, my God, look at her AIDS!  But then you make fun of the broads that, uh, get all that plastic surgery.  But then here's the other option for some people.  Oh, Sam can't get it.  You can't find it for the movie?  Does she have an eating disorder or something?  They showed a clip from the movie that she's nominated in.  What's the movie, uh, she's nominated in?  Does anyone know?  Twister?  Twister's up for how many awards this year?  Oh, my God.  Special effects?  You're going to give it one more shot?  You want a clip from the movie? 
[02:01:00]  Nah, I don't really need to.  This is obviously...  She's an ugly woman.  And it's not going anywhere, so just trust me on this.  Trust me on this.  All right.  Do your own research.  Do your own Google.  Yeah, find it.  You just Google it.  Anyway, um, I'm going to mention, uh, some of that, uh, a name that makes people turn off  our show, but I, I, I just, I, I would, I would beg you to, like, give it a shot in  an open mind.  Oh, my God.  He's been on mic all morning.  Why don't you just leave him alone?  Are you talking about E-Rock or...  Uh, Sam Roper.  Damn it. 
[02:01:30]  Don't use my damn it.  That wasn't yours.  I'm close to having a t-shirt made because I say that.  Yeah.  Damn it!  No, you can't use that.  Aw, people are using your word.  Damn it!  Damn it!  Um, Bobo was on the after show.  Oh.  And he was doing Academy Awards, uh, talk.  Well, I think that he called with the intention of clarifying whatever bullshit he was doing  with that girl on Twitter.  Yeah.  But, uh, I was talking Academy Awards, I see Bobo on the phone, and I'm instantly thinking, 
[02:02:00]  well, there's only one thing to talk about with this guy.  Well...  That's the movies.  Here's the problem.  Now, I, uh...  Did you hear this?  I do enjoy tuning in to the Sam Roberts after show on my way home.  You better isolate that.  Yeah, isolate that one.  Uh, uh, and, and I was listening, and Bobo, who had called us prior that day, if you remember,  and we heard this...  Um...  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[02:02:30]  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  He fucking was...  You couldn't understand him.  His phone stunk.  And he was, like, just all, all depressed.  Mm-hmm.  Well, fuck it.  He gets on the Sam Roberts show there.  He's all fucking peppy.  His phone is fine.  He's literally singing songs.  What?  On the show.  You got real material out of the guy?  Yes.  Bobo is a guy who knows Hollywood.  When you talk Hollywood with him, that's what the people want to hear?  That's what he wants to talk about? 
[02:03:00]  Like, this motherfucker didn't give a shit.  No.  He's mumbling under his breath on a fucking goddamn Sports Illustrated football phone.  And the motherfucker gets on your show.  He's all full of energy.  Be honest.  Do you know what the Sports Illustrated football phone is?  Yes, I do.  They gave you a free football phone with the magazine.  Child of the 80s.  Yes.  That's right.  Be honest.  He sounded better than...  He's closer to 40.  He's older than he looks.  You know you're closer to 40 than 18, right?  Closer to...  No, I'm the same distance.  No, you're not.  No.  29.  Not today. 
[02:03:30]  Mm-hmm.  When's your birthday?  September, so probably closer to 18.  No.  Nope.  What do you mean, no?  Nope.  So closer to 40 than 20.  True.  I used to do that math.  It stings a bit.  I stopped doing that math a while ago.  Yeah, but are you sure?  Should we play the game in reverse?  No, it's okay.  I guess you're not closer to 40 than 20.  Nine from...  No.  I'm way further.  Way...  Yeah, no.  You're closer to 40 than 17. 
[02:04:00]  What?  You're closer to 40 than when you launch that stupid quarter off your ankle.  True.  Way closer to 40 than that.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Um...  Do you realize...  Mm-hmm.  You're in your 20s.  Correct.  But in 11 years...  Yeah.  You'll be 40.  How the fuck does that happen?  True.  20s, 40...  But then only 11 years.  So you skip to 30s?  Is that how that works?  Your 30s are gone!  Already?  Just get rid of them!  Yeah.  So, fuck. 
[02:04:30]  Do you remember...  Yeah, you remember when you were 18, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Till now?  Yeah.  In that time period?  Yeah.  Seemed like it went pretty quick, right?  I was just 18.  Yeah, well, you know what?  You're going to be 40.  You'll be 40 when that happens.  At the exact same time.  I just said it.  I just said it.  Wait...  You'll be our age when that happens.  You know that.  In another 11 years.  Now, look at us.  You're going to be our age.  You know that if...  You got to 40?  40 years old.  Huh?  You know if I got a girl pregnant as I was graduating high school?  Yeah.  That kid would now be 18. 
[02:05:00]  And graduating high school.  How fucked up is that?  Wait, how fucked up is that?  I think that's Sam Roberts.  So, Bobo...  Stupid kid, or...?  Oh, wow.  Bobo, he's watched all the movies?  Oh, well, that's just that.  Because he's got something on Argo?  No one has anything on Argo.  Well, I did.  I saw Argo.  All right, so Bobo talks about Argo on the after show with Sam Roberts.  You're on After Open Anthony Live.  Yeah, this is me, Bobo.  All right. 
[02:05:30]  This is me, Bobo.  I'm glad you're finally on.  What did you think?  Yeah, I mean, it was a little controversial.  The Oscars came out.  Ben Affleck not nominated for director.  A lot of people thought Argo...  It did get nominated for Best Picture.  Not for Best Director, Ben Affleck.  Yes.  Bobo, what say you?  Yes.  Oh, I think he should have been nominated.  How did you find that film?  Did you find it...  Did you like it?  Did you think it was exciting?  Would you have preferred a little more historical accuracy?  What did you think?  I enjoyed it. 
[02:06:00]  I don't mind if someone wants to change a little thing.  I don't know, a little poetic license.  Right, right.  I know about you and your poetic license.  What was your favorite part of the film?  Well, I don't really have a favorite.  Right.  Did you see it or no?  Well, I got to see it.  You did?  Yeah.  Argo, fuck yourself.  Right, Bobo?  Well, I guess you could say that.  Double guns.  Double guns, indeed.  There's a line in the movie.  Bobo did not see the film. 
[02:06:30]  It said throughout the film.  What about Les Mis, Bobo?  Oh, my God.  Maybe we shouldn't play that.  I don't think you saw the movie.  You know, I don't think you saw it.  The only movie he did see this year was Batman.  He saw Batman.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I saw Batman.  He's got opinions on that.  Yeah.  What about...  Yeah.  I didn't even see that.  You missed Wreck-It Ralph.  What got nominated for animated?  I think the only movie I went to see this year, I think, I can recall, I think the last  movie I went to see in the theaters was Dark Knight Rises. 
[02:07:00]  Dark Knight Rises.  Snubbed!  A lot of people surprised that Tom Hardy's portrayal of Bane did not get nominated for  either Best Actor or Best Supporting Actor.  Bobo, did you see that coming or did you think he would be nominated?  I thought he would be nominated.  I thought he did a good job as Bane.  I did, too.  That's a very strange thing.  I was wrong.  I hate this.  Why?  It's terrible.  Bobo thought Bane would be nominated for an Academy Award.  I thought that Bane would be nominated. 
[02:07:30]  He was surprised that Tom Hardy's portrayal of Bane was not nominated for an Academy Award.  You can't nominate an actor for an Academy Award if you can't see his lips moving.  You just can't do it.  Name one.  Name one that got nominated and you never saw their lips move in the movie.  Great performance.  Bobo disagrees.  And then he has something to say about Anne Hathaway?  Of course he doesn't.  Yes, he does.  He's the Hollywood guy.  And what about this? 
[02:08:00]  Anne Hathaway, that name pops up, but shocks the world.  It's for Les Mis.  Did we forget she played Catwoman?  Bobo, were you surprised that Catwoman was not the nomination for Best Supporting Actress?  Yeah, I'm surprised about that.  Yeah, me too.  Hiya.  Hiya.  Me too.  Roland, are you surprised or did you think it was going to be Les Mis?  I had a sneaky feeling.  You thought it would be Les Mis.  I think a PR campaign was going, you know what?  And we got a little Roland in there saying things that I can't even fucking... 
[02:08:30]  I thought you said this was good.  The after show's a wild time.  Maybe when it's on the after show, it's really good because the after show itself is, you know, it's the after show.  And then when you put it up on the main stage here...  I don't know, because this is like the type of thing...  This is second stage shit.  Right, right.  I'm not saying there's not an audience for the second stage.  But this is the main stage right here.  No, this is the type of thing like, Anne's going to hear these clips, I'll play them on the after show, and he'll be driving, and he'll be like, these are great clips. 
[02:09:00]  And then he'll come in on Monday and be like, you played those clips on the after show, they sounded great on our show, they're terrible.  What happened?  I don't know.  It's true, though.  Because we don't have the energy to try to pump this up and make something out of it.  Yeah, yeah.  Right?  Which, you know, you're trying to make a career for yourself.  Yeah.  We're on the ass end of ours.  You are.  So maybe the clips are presented differently.  You're in the valley.  That's right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're climbing up.  We're sliding down.  Gotcha.  We don't even need our fucking foot on the gas pedal anymore. 
[02:09:30]  No.  Yeah, how do you do on the way down?  That's right.  As you're climbing up.  That's right.  And we look over and go, remember that?  That was hard.  Because I pump shit up.  Yeah.  I do a lot of work.  Yeah.  What's that like?  Hard.  Work smirk.  One more clip from Bobo.  Luckily, they don't recognize it.  Work is for jerks.  Bobo, can you believe that Ted did not receive one nomination?  I can't believe it.  All right?  Seth MacFarlane's freaking excellent in that movie.  The guy's a freaking genius.  He's a machine, isn't he?  Yeah, exactly.  No, Bobo.  That's wrong. 
[02:10:00]  He's a bear.  You obviously did not see the film.  No, I know Ted's a bear.  Oh, okay.  I know Ted's a bear.  As a matter of fact, they got proof I sing the movie.  Oh.  I will sing the Thunder Buddy song for that movie.  Please do.  All right.  When you hear the sound of thunder, just say these magic words.  Fuck you, thunder.  You can suck my dick.  You can't get me thunder because you're just got spots.  Bobo, I want to thank you for your call today.  You were great.  Thanks.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  How does he know that? 
[02:10:30]  And he does the accent, too.  Farts.  Oh, man.  Yeah, yeah.  He did the accent.  Right.  Just at the end, though.  Yeah, yeah.  Just on the word farts.  All right.  Very good.  There's our Oscar segment.  I think we've covered it.  It's good reporting.  That's right.  The after show has a Hollywood correspondent now.  When are the Oscars?  Soon?  A couple weeks?  Three weeks?  Four weeks?  How many weeks?  Usually in February.  Mid-February, maybe?  Near the end of February? 
[02:11:00]  I know we've got to do the Super Bowl first, and then it's the Oscars, right?  Yes.  That's how that works.  Super Bowl is early February.  I can't wait.  February.  We're finally fucking going to the Super Bowl.  Are we?  Huh?  Wait, the Super Bowl.  How many weeks is the Super Bowl?  Wait, that's a great question.  Well, you've got the two weeks in between, and then we've got another two weeks.  Well, aren't we discussing it already?  Super Bowl is at least four weeks away at this point.  Aren't we discussing the show going?  Remember last year?  Wait, remember last year?  We all said, well, next year. 
[02:11:30]  Because last year, we really made a stink of it that they were going to put us in with  all the other...  It's in three weeks, the Super Bowl.  And it was like a great thing.  No, it can't be.  Wow.  Oh, wait, they only take one week, though?  One week off.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, so what are our tickets, I guess?  And what hotel are we staying at?  When do we fly?  Yeah, when are we flying out?  When are we flying in?  Where are we going to be the Super Bowl this year?  Hopefully somewhere warm.  New Orleans.  We'll be in New Orleans.  All right.  So we're going to be in New Orleans.  Get out of the New York winter.  Remember last year?  Nice.  Remember last year? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Radio Row.  We were talking about Radio Row, and then we were like, oh, we want to go.  And then they were like, oh, well, if you want to, you know, next year, now that  we know you would want to do that.  We did talk to management way in advance, and they were like, we're already working on it.  Oh, cool.  So we're going to the Super Bowl.  They did something before.  Nice.  So we're already working on it.  I remember having meetings about it months ago.  All right, cool.  So is the whole staff going, or just the talent, or am I going to get to go?  What staff are we talking about?  Like, me specifically.  Am I going to...  Which show?  That'll be an Anthony show.  I don't think we're going. 
[02:12:30]  Wow, shit.  Just the talent?  That's not fair.  Ah, stop.  That's funny.  We're not going.  Stop.  Oh, the show isn't going?  Wait, the show isn't going?  But I thought, but when we talked about it last...  Not just the...  We had a year in advance, a year notice that we gave them that we wanted to go, and then  we were told that, yes, we will work on this so you guys can go next year, because we didn't  know that you guys would have been happy on Radio Row, when meanwhile, every celebrity  was on Radio Row.  You said you wanted to be on Radio Row.  So we were like, we want to, and they're like, oh, okay, well then we'll work it out  where next year you go to the Super Bowl, and now it's three weeks away? 
[02:13:00]  And yeah, we'll be there.  So I guess we're there.  Cool.  Nice.  All right.  Finally.  When psyched.  We've been trying to go there.  This will be the 18th straight year.  We've been trying to go to the Super Bowl, and it finally happens.  So what's the specific travel arrangements for us?  Travis, what have you heard about travel?  I was told we were not traveling.  Kenny is always up on these things.  Yeah.  But I haven't heard one thing from Kenny about travel.  Maybe he's not...  He's too busy with the Nashville shit right now.  Is that it?  Itinerary.  As soon as he's done with Nashville with Jim Norton, I'm sure he'll give us our 20-page... 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Itinerary and fucking...  Travis, comment, Travis.  I know this much.  I know that next year's Super Bowl, there is a great chance that you guys are going to be  as can do something.  Well, why is that?  It is going to be in New York City.  Oh.  Oh, you mean so we'll do two Super Bowls in a row?  This is great.  Yes.  I can see where they're going to have the Super Bowl from my house.  If I'm not there.  Oh, you wouldn't be.  There's no way we're going to the Super Bowl ever, ever in this fucking company.  Who was in the 1994 Super Bowl? 
[02:14:00]  This is how long me and Ann have been doing it together.  I need to know.  It wasn't the Bronco Bash.  That was later.  No, that was 98.  99.  I was told that the Super Bowl was probably not happening.  By who?  When?  By Gary.  When?  Two weeks ago?  Oh.  We told him a year ago.  We're like, well, there's plenty of advance notice.  But the radio wizard, I was told he could get anything done. 
[02:14:30]  Ever since he was a young boy.  Uh-huh.  He's been fucking bald.  He's been fucking bald.  It was at San Francisco-San Diego Super Bowl in 1994.  I remember that one, 49-26, fucking San Francisco.  You remember that?  Yeah.  Was that a Joe Montana year?  Super Bowl 29.  I remember that one.  Was it a Joe Montana year?  No.  Who won the Bud Bowl that year?  I mean, no.  That's true.  I think it was Bud Light.  Oh.  Yeah.  Steve Young?  Jerry Rice.  Steve Young, yes.  Steve Young. 
[02:15:00]  Stevie Young.  And Jerry Rice.  Well, those guys are still playing, so we're not that old.  Oh, okay.  Oops.  Oh.  That's right.  Oops.  Dion?  Dion Sanders.  Yeah.  Was in that Super Bowl?  He started, you know he started using the name Primetime after I started using it?  Fucking.  After?  I think so, yeah.  Wow.  I'm such a liar.  All right, we're going to break because we got the great Bob Kelly outside the studio.  He's going to be a father.  Where's the one that comes in and does our show, though?  After.  No Super Bowl, then?  And I know he's joking. 
[02:15:30]  I don't think he is.  No, he's joking.  I was only joking.  Y-Rock, how many times have we talked about going to the Super Bowl, would you say?  Let's see.  I got kicked out of going to sales meetings in 2010 because I kept bringing it up every  meeting.  I was never invited back.  Why would they get mad at that?  Well, they brought a small buffet and, well, they thought it would feed everyone.  Yeah.  Well, you know what happened next, right?  Really?  You brought it up every sales meeting?  Yeah, to the point that I was told I no longer needed to attend the sales meeting. 
[02:16:00]  And us never to return.  I know it was discussed at some point.  By us?  Yes.  Why have we never been to a Super Bowl?  It's astounding.  Radio guys go every year.  But here we go now.  Now.  Now.  And there's always a reason why.  I understand there'll always be a reason why.  And in their stupid brains, it'll always be logical.  But all I'm saying is in 18 years of doing radio together, 18 and a half at this point,  I think.  We've never done a Super Bowl broadcast. 
[02:16:30]  Okay?  That's crazy.  Now that we know we're not going, who is going?  That's what I want to know.  I can't wait to know.  Who is going to the Super Bowls?  How many Super Bowls have the morning mashup gone to?  Let me find out.  I think Covino and Rich might be going.  Ah, Covino and Rich.  Which, by the way, you know, is, they're trying to make it a younger version of us.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We're the mold for that show.  Who?  Because I know.  Mad Dog's going.  Because I know who put that show together. 
[02:17:00]  Mad Dog.  What?  Well, Mad Dog's sports.  I'm sports guy.  You've got to give a pass.  I'm not even going to give him.  Yeah, of course.  He's got to go.  But I bet, I bet fucking, what's his name?  Right Said Fred, whatever his fucking name is.  Right Said.  I think Book Radio's got it.  Book Radio.  Fucking A.  Right Said Fred.  Ron and Fez.  Ron and Fez.  I think they get shut out, too.  Yeah, they do.  Of course.  And they know.  Super Bowl 2014.  Giant Stadium. 
[02:17:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  I like how that sounds.  Let's get on that.  Yeah, come on.  Look at Sam.  He's all excited.  That means he's got a good answer.  Sam.  All right.  The question was, how many Super Bowls have the morning mashup  gone to?  Now, the morning mashup is a show done by four people so they could talk for maybe five  minutes an hour.  Right.  Well, I'll say New Orleans, the morning mashup will be in the house.  And how many have they gone to?  This is the morning mashup's second Super Bowl.  That's it.  However. 
[02:18:00]  Why are there?  But that's two more than us.  I talked to Rich.  Yeah.  Kavino and Rich will be in the house.  How can they not get us to the house?  So he's going twice.  Would you like to know?  Yeah.  How many Super Bowls Kavino and Rich have been to?  How long have they been on the air?  Dad, I don't know.  I think six years.  That show was created by a guy that worked closely with the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh.  So, you know, we're the mold for that show, I'm going to say to get.  They've been together six years?  I think so, yeah.  So I would guess five Super Bowls. 
[02:18:30]  Rich told me they've been to nine Super Bowls.  Oh.  The nine.  How is that?  What?  Nine times.  They've been nine times.  Nine times.  Does it just say asshole on my forehead and I just don't see it?  Like, why haven't we ever been to a Super Bowl?  How could they not work this out?  What's the excuse this time?  Because we gave them a complete knowledge that we wanted to go. 
[02:19:00]  This wasn't anything that said, well, they might want to go.  We fucking creamed last year about this.  Now, also, we gave them one year's notice.  One year's notice.  I'm happy we're not going because it keeps the bit going.  Well, of course.  I used to hate on LeBron James, but then he wins his Super Bowl.  He wins his championship ring.  Now it doesn't matter.  Game over.  Game over.  Yeah, now it's like, ah, fuck.  I asked that out of my own personal curiosity over Christmas break because we were thinking  about doing something that weekend if the show was going, and I was told probably not. 
[02:19:30]  Now, can I ask again?  I didn't ask a follow-up question.  Why, given the circumstances of intent, they knew we wanted to go.  They said they were going to make it, we were going to have us go.  And one year's advance notice.  This isn't one of those things, well, if you asked her sooner, what happened?  A ball got dropped here. 
[02:20:00]  I'm not taking any excuses.  I'm not hearing kicked upstairs.  I'm not hearing budget things because the morning mashup's going.  Covino and Rich are going.  And I'm sure others are going around this building that we don't know of yet.  It's about time they stopped kicking the can.  Why the fuck aren't we going?  I bet Sway's going.  I bet Sway's going.  How long has he been with the company?  Oh, you know who gets to go usually?  Who?  The Comedy Channel, Raw Dog.  The Comedy Channel.  But they play just records.  But football is generally hilarious. 
[02:20:30]  Well, that's true.  That's why they try to cover the Super Bowl.  Hilarious.  Yeah.  Do you want me to find out?  Please.  I want nothing more right now than to find out why, what the circumstances are.  Now we're over the weekend.  Now.  Right the fuck now.  We'll get that update after the break.  Please.  I got to know why, with a year's notice, we are not going to the Super Bowl.  When we started broadcasting in 94, summer of 94, so how many Super Bowls would that be? 
[02:21:00]  18 and a half years, so it might be 17.  Oh, God.  Technically, maybe 18.  17 chances.  This could be the 18th opportunity.  18th Super Bowl that you have not gone to.  We're zero for 18.  Oh, and 18.  Oh, my God.  The dopiest show in America has gone a few times.  Yeah.  Which show is that?  Just a, I don't know.  I don't even know what show to make fun of anymore.  There's not many left.  There really isn't any left.  All right, Bob Kelly next, and we'll get the answer to the Super Bowl question as well. 
[02:21:30]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  The following sexually explicit CB radio transmission took place one evening in early 2010 between radio personalities Jim Norton and Anthony Cumia.  Neither party has been made aware of its existence until now.  I'm thinking about you.  Yeah.  Did you get the video I sent?  Yeah.  I really do want to be rough with you.  Wow.  Well, what do you want to do? 
[02:22:00]  What are you going to do to wear me?  I want to treat you rough, throw you around, spank and slap you, slap your face.  Yeah.  Treat you like a dirty little whore, put my cock in your ass and then shove it down your throat.  I want you to bite me.  Now you're talking?  Then I'm going to tell you to shut the fuck up while I slap your face and pull your hair for making noise.  Wow.  I want you to beg for my cock.  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  Kiss you all over to convince me.  Let me let you have it in your mouth.  We will see how bad you want me.  Whatever else turns you on.  Whatever I want, you are mine.  You please me like no other has or ever will.  I'm not losing that.  Great thing is we have a lifetime of this.  Okay, lights out.  Good night, sexy.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Look like that. 
[02:23:00]  Or an evangelist or something.  Me and Bobby.  Bob Kelly's in studio.  And I just had one of the hardest laughs in a long fucking time.  And I know we can't even do it justice on the show.  But of course, we're going to try like assholes.  We go to the bathroom together to catch up a little bit because Bob Kelly's going to be a father.  Yes.  Ah, yes.  Baby boy.  Yes.  And so we're like, I'm trying to take a leak.  He's standing there talking to me.  And then behind Bobby is this guy that looks either like a magician. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah.  He looks like a magician.  Not from Vegas.  From Reno.  Or the outskirts of Reno.  Okay.  And the Indian Casino.  But I recognize him.  Oh, really?  And you're the type of guy you probably would know who he is.  Oh.  He takes himself way too seriously.  Yeah.  This could blow up in our face.  Is he an actor?  I don't think so.  He had definitely not an actor.  He had horrendous fake dark hair.  He had a briefcase.  He had a canvas briefcase.  How do you know him from that way?  He just looks familiar. 
[02:24:00]  Then he had horrible fake teeth.  And he was dressed perfectly.  And he was putting something in his mouth to clean his fake teeth.  But he didn't want to get it on his tie or his really pressed nicely white shirt.  So he was leaning all the way back.  And then making this weird fucking face.  And that's what I made Bobby turn around.  Oh, man.  But he kept doing it over and over.  But he kept doing it over and over again.  And I'm literally a foot away from laughing at him.  And Obi's holding his cock laughing at him.  And he would not stop.  Wow.  It was just obsessive. 
[02:24:30]  And then Bobby goes, wow, this is perfect music right now.  Oh, it was Elvis.  It was Elvis.  Oh, Elvis.  Yeah, kind of had that Elvis vibe to him.  Yeah.  He, he, he reminds me.  So could you find out who the guests are today?  Yeah, find out.  At this time?  Because I, I need to know who this guy is.  I'm going to take, I'm going to guess right now.  Magician.  You're guessing a magician?  All right.  Who are you guessing?  But you definitely recognize him from somewhere?  I, I feel like he's, uh, yeah, somebody.  Uh, I, I want to go like, uh, motivational speaker type.  Oh, an evangelist. 
[02:25:00]  Fucking trail of park people.  Who would be?  Uh, he's done some TV.  I know that.  So, uh, so you're saying he has to do with helping people?  Like a speaker.  He'd take himself very, very fucking.  He thinks he's the shit.  There's a lot of guests, huh?  He thinks he's the shit.  I'll guess his name right now.  Give me a name.  What do you got?  Uh, will it happen like just now?  Yeah.  Yes.  So he's getting ready.  So could he.  He just arrived.  Nine o'clock.  Nine o'clock.  Who's Jack?  Jackie.  Can't.  There's a couple of doctors.  Dr. Robert.  He could have been a doctor. 
[02:25:30]  But a shitty, but a shitty doctor.  Wait.  Is he a TV doctor?  Ken Linder.  Did you talk to your doctor?  Who's Ken Linder?  Stanker, too.  Go.  Google image Ken Linder.  Oh, nice.  This is going to be fun when it pops up and you're.  Nope.  Nope.  All right.  Keep going.  All right.  Nope.  That guy.  That's Ken Linder.  That's Ken Linder.  What is he?  What is he?  I knew.  What is he?  I love it. 
[02:26:00]  That's the guy.  That's the guy.  I feel like we just met someone.  Is there any YouTube on Ken Linder?  I'm sure.  What does he do?  What does he do?  What does he do?  He's definitely been on a bunch of shows.  There he is on.  I'm controlling emotions.  That's him.  Motivation.  You called it.  Shit.  Play it in love.  I want to hear it.  But his hobbies are magic.  No.  I swear to God.  It says it on his radio.  No, it doesn't.  So then we're both right.  He was on the Today Show.  He was on the Today Show.  Man.  He was on the Today Show.  He was on the Today Show.  Man. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, God.  Wow.  Look at him.  I don't trust people.  That was so funny.  It's like you were looking at a lineup of the photos of a murderer.  And you're like, yeah, that's him.  I don't trust people who don't have eyebrows.  Yeah, he does.  He is devoid of eyebrows.  He looks like his face didn't move a lot either.  You know?  Yeah.  I'm not really sure.  He said something.  Maybe he said something.  Wow, man.  Yeah, dude.  He did.  We don't know.  We don't know.  We don't know.  Look at his hair.  He has no eyebrows.  First try.  And he has a first hair on the Today Show.  First try.  You guys got it.  This morning on New Year, New You, 2013, controlling your emotions to get the most out of life. 
[02:27:00]  Ken Lindner is the founder of Life Choice Psychology.  Life Choice Psychology?  He's also the author of the book, Your Killer Emotions.  Look at his smile.  Your Killer Emotions is the name of his book.  And psychiatrist, Dr. Gail Saltz is a today contributor.  Good morning to both.  Nice to have you here.  Good morning, Lester.  Ken, let's start with you.  You have given advice to countless people over the years.  It almost seems like it's our nature to make big decisions when we're stressed or when  we're frustrated, we're mad, we're excited about something. 
[02:27:30]  How do we get around that nature?  How destructive is it?  Can you pause it real quick?  It's very destructive if the emotions lead you to make a toxic, self-sabotaging decision.  All right.  Right.  God damn it.  Look at him now.  You want to hear more?  No, it sounds like stalker Patty.  Self-sabotaging decision.  So Bob Kelly's here.  What's up?  Where are you going to be performing there, Bobby?  Bananas.  Bananas, Hasbro Heights.  One of my favorite clubs.  I've never fucking been there. 
[02:28:00]  A lot of you guys say it's one of your favorite clubs.  Look, man, visually, you know what I mean?  It's like one of those diners you drive by in the middle of the country.  You're like, look at that shithole.  And you go in, it has the best ribs in the world.  You know, you walk, you drive by, you're like, what the fuck?  But this is one of my favorite clubs.  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, it's great.  Because Jersey, they pack it up.  It's great.  It's one of my favorite clubs.  Tonight, one show.  That's it.  Tomorrow, too.  Oh, okay.  I do two on Saturday.  You might as well.  One on Friday.  One on Friday.  It's such a smart idea.  Why blow yourself out like that? 
[02:28:30]  They do that 8 o'clock show, a 7.30 show on Friday.  People just came from work.  There's nothing worse than looking out at a crowd and they're fucking exhausted.  Yeah.  And they're just, ugh.  You see the dude yawn in the middle of your joke.  That's got to be fucking frustrating.  You see the chick check her watch nine times to a, like at 45 minutes, is he wrapping up?  But you guys can't win because in the late show, they're all fucking drunk.  On Friday.  On Friday, right?  Yeah, but when you smoosh it into 9 o'clock, then you get some people. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, you get a little bit of a...  You get a little bit.  They get a nap after the work.  They get a nice cocktail.  Yeah, the chick gets to go home and have some tea, wash her box.  You know what I mean?  Chicks aren't comfortable when they have dirty work boxes.  Really?  Yeah, when they've been working all day and they have to go straight from out to some  thing from work and they get a hot box.  Right.  Bobby's right because you never did our N.E.W. show.  Uh-uh.  When did we start knowing you?  Serious.  No, I understand that, but right away?  XM, yeah, right away. 
[02:29:30]  Right away, yeah.  Because we met, I think, during the time off.  I was in the car when you got booted with Norton.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I wish I took a picture of that face.  Yeah, that was not fun.  It was sad.  We were in a limo.  We just had a great show.  So, and then he got the call.  We were in a limo.  They took care of his corporate gig.  It was awesome.  A lot of money.  Good thing.  And then he got the call.  That's hilarious, Bobby.  Yeah.  Way to bring down the show.  This is Friday.  I've been telling the same story.  Oh, yeah.  At N.E.W. when we were doing Afternoon Drive.  Yeah.  We got to see all the women washing their boxes in between work and going to happy hour. 
[02:30:00]  What are you talking about?  In the bathroom?  We had a window.  We had the greatest window in New York City.  Oh, I forgot about that.  Yes, yes, yes.  We had the greatest window.  It overlooked this apartment with all the thin bathroom windows.  It was a big apartment building.  Yeah.  And there was how many?  At least 10 floors.  Yeah.  And every day, guarantee, there was at least one.  It had the glass that was all, like, you couldn't see through it, but they would always open up their windows.  And you could see them using the baby wipe, what it was meant for, washing boxes. 
[02:30:30]  I remember they did shave.  We saw the shaving of the box, everything.  They didn't give a fuck.  I guess they just assumed no one was looking around.  I don't know.  We were.  We certainly were.  Oh, they probably don't care.  After a while, you're like, I don't care.  That's true.  I don't care.  Just my box.  It was nice, though.  Yeah.  And then at K-Rock, that big window.  Oh, yeah.  Howard used to have it covered up, but we discovered there was a window behind there.  We said, fuck that.  We need that window.  It was a giant, like, bay window kind of thing. 
[02:31:00]  I remember that.  And there was a girl across the way that used to change all the time.  There was a few people that used to get naked over there, too.  She got on her exercise bicycle, and then she would fucking shower.  She was a mess, but just because she was naked, you just felt fucking like it was the hottest thing ever.  She was a mess of a box.  She had a mess of a box.  There was one from the K-Rock studio.  There was one from the K-Rock office, and then until they demolished the steakhouse and  those apartments across from XM, there was one there, too.  Oh, right.  There was one across from XM. 
[02:31:30]  And then they evicted everybody over there and demolished the building.  I forgot about that.  You're right.  Bitches.  We may have photos.  Yeah, it was hot.  There's something hot about it.  I don't care how ugly they are, but seeing tit when you're not supposed to see tit.  Completely agree.  Just the secret fucking, I'm spying on you.  Yes.  Yeah, that's like seeing, like, famous tit.  Even though, whatever, she did a movie and you start, you could see it, but just seeing  a tit slip out.  Why is that hot?  Because you're not supposed to.  Yeah?  It's like, yeah.  It's like, you know, you get desensitized to the tit around you because you see it all 
[02:32:00]  the time.  That's why I tell my wife not to walk around naked all the time.  Don't walk around naked?  Yeah, because I don't want to get so used to your tits, you're just like a roommate.  It becomes like an elbow.  Yeah, an elbow.  Anything.  Yeah.  Boom!  Yeah, you're right.  Unsexy.  And tits now are getting huge, too.  Are they?  Yeah, what's going on with the nipples?  They get a little weird, Bobby, when they get pregnant.  Oh, you're talking about your pregnant wife.  That's the question.  What's going on?  The nipples get dark and big.  Yeah, they're big.  Because the kids, when they pop out, they can only see about a half a centimeter in front 
[02:32:30]  of them.  So they need to see that target.  They got to bullseye them?  Yeah.  They got to bullseye them.  So, yeah, women's nipples get dark.  Is that why they get dark?  Wow.  Really dark.  That's crazy.  That's so fucking nuts that there's actually a reason for it.  They go back, though.  They go back?  They go back.  I don't want them to.  I like them big, fat.  No, I mean, the darkness goes back.  The darkness goes back.  I like the darkness.  The darkness of the nipple goes back.  I'm losing.  I have bad vision, too.  You want to be able to crawl up there?  We were discussing your fatherhood earlier. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, shit.  Because you're like a gadgets guy.  Yeah.  You're in trouble, man.  I do.  Have you gone through a baby gap or any of those places?  Babies R Us is the place.  I said baby gap earlier.  Yeah, I started hyperventilating.  There's so much shit.  There's so much shit, but there's so much people.  And then the people that work at the one, they don't know shit.  They have a 14-year-old kid from fucking the Bronx working strollers.  You're like, dude, which? 
[02:33:30]  Yo, man, I don't know.  It's like, what the fuck?  You know what?  We should make a video.  You fucking hyperventilating that place.  Because I forgot about this.  There's a stroller section in it.  It's like picking out a new car.  And every one looks good.  And then you've got to figure out why this one over that one and that one over this one.  But it's like picking out a new car, if they forced us to only put all the cars together, like Ford, Honda.  You know, like, you know, Honda, I'm just looking at Hondas and the occasional trading.  You know, you're right, because if you go to a Honda dealership, it's down to two cars probably. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  But if you put them all together, yes.  Oh, man.  Like, all the cool cars together.  Right.  And they all do different shit.  And they all have, and none of them, it's like, dude, there's one.  It's like $1,000.  A thousand bucks.  Wait, hold on, son.  All right.  It's big business, man.  And you, as you push it, it charges, okay?  So it has like, it charges your iPhone or itself.  Only Bobby would find one that charges an iPhone. 
[02:34:30]  It has a button you push, and it collapses automatically, like a robot.  It has gears in it.  It knows when there's something in the carriage.  Yeah, they've got to figure that out.  It will not close.  And then you can push the button, it opens back up.  So you don't ever have to do anything.  You push a button.  Automatically.  And it has headlights on it for nighttime.  It has a computer screen on it.  What?  Dude, I want this carriage so bad.  And she's like...  Of course he does.  What did I say earlier? 
[02:35:00]  I check Bobby.  Why would you want a carriage that you push a button and boom?  No, that's your thing.  You like gadgets.  I'm a big gadget.  I don't like carrying around a lot of stuff, and I don't like the bells and whistles.  You're a gadgety guy.  Oh, dude, I'm a big gadget.  That's why we're very different.  CES this week?  I've been hard all week.  Oh, you went to CES?  No, I just, it's happening.  I was just thinking about it.  There's all the shit that's going down.  We left Babies R Us with at least two shopping carts completely filled, and then it turns  out...  With babies?  Fast forward.  I didn't use half the shit.  Second kid, we didn't even go to Babies R Us.  But you don't need a bassinet. 
[02:35:30]  Why do you need a bassinet?  Well...  And what the fuck is a bassinet?  What the fuck?  You need a bunch of those.  Why do you need a bassinet?  You need a traveling one.  You have a stroller.  You need one that's in the living room.  You need one to fucking put the kid in when you're eating on your table.  What the fuck is a bassinet?  Yeah.  It's a mini bed, right?  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  But if you have a crib, and then you have the stroller, right?  Mm-hmm.  Okay, so the kid goes to the bed in the crib, right? 
[02:36:00]  And then you have the stroller, and then you have the bassinet, but then you have the  bouncy chair.  You need a bouncy chair.  Why do you need a bouncy chair?  Do you got the one that fucking...  I never had a fucking bouncy chair.  You got the one that fucking rocks like a kangaroo?  I'm getting one that has five...  More like a treehouse?  Treehouse mode?  Yes.  Who the fuck is that?  It has...  It has...  It goes forward, backwards...  No, the one that's like...  It's automatic.  I got one...  There's one...  I got one with five modes that I'm getting.  There's five modes.  Car ride?  It has...  It has car ride setting? 
[02:36:30]  Car ride?  I could finally talk to Soto about this.  So fucking...  It like lets the kid think he's in a car?  Yeah.  Car ride.  It has car ride mode.  Yeah, I think it has treehouse.  I have treehouse.  Kangaroo is one as well.  Is that where your best friend tries to have sex with you?  Treehouse mode?  Kangaroo.  Oh!  Ocean waves?  I have that.  But did yours play music?  Yep.  Really?  What kind of music, though?  Did yours have an SD card so you can play?  Mine can pop my fucking iPhone in there.  I don't have an iPhone. 
[02:37:00]  My wife's iPhone in there.  You can pop my iPhone in there.  But I have an SD slot so you can actually pick a little thing.  What does yours look like?  A little track list.  I never thought they were high tech in these fucking things.  Huh?  Huh?  What does yours look like?  Mine.  Does it look like it's from the future?  Yes.  Looks like a baby pod.  Yeah, it's like a little pod like this.  And then it kind of...  And you know what happens to these?  What?  You spend like around 600 bucks on these or 400 bucks.  Yeah.  And then around a year in, you throw them out because they don't use them anymore.  They don't use them?  Why do you got your shit already?  Huh?  Why do you got your shit already?  I don't have it. 
[02:37:30]  I have it picked out.  Oh, you got it all picked out for the registry.  My wife was going to buy all this shit.  I'm like, no, you have these people buy it.  Oh.  True.  You have other people buy it.  For the first kid.  Second kid, you're on your own.  Baby shower.  We had to fill out the form for the registry.  And she's like, thank you so much for checking it out.  Whatever you can do.  I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  It should say...  We need this.  Babies have a lot of shit, as you know.  And you don't have to buy the most expensive thing, like the $500 stroller that we're going  to get.  But you should. 
[02:38:00]  Because we need it.  But don't be the...  I wrote, don't be the cheap prick that buys the recyclable diaper packages for $19.99.  Do you really want to be that guy?  I can tell you the stuff...  You're guilting people.  Yes.  I can tell you the stuff you need and don't need.  You need the diaper pail.  And here's...  So your place don't smell like shit.  I didn't even know what a fucking diaper pail was until two days ago.  Oh, yeah.  You shoved those diapers in that thing.  It's a trash bucket, Anthony.  Look at me.  This would be good for your house when you have parties. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, actually, you might be able to use this one.  We don't have to see them floating in the pool.  You might be able to use this one, for real.  You could put shit underwear in there.  You could put little...  Bloody fucking panties.  Bloody panties and shit like that.  It's a trash can.  A tall, thin trash can.  Tight seal, though.  Tight seal.  Tight plastic seal, man.  They don't leave anything open.  Push a button with your foot.  It opens.  You throw the dirty diaper in.  It's a double...  You push it down.  No, you know not mine.  Mine does it itself.  Like a garbage truck.  You put it in. 
[02:39:00]  What do you mean yours does it itself?  You drop it in, right?  That's all you have to do?  And then when it closes, it pushes it down for you into the second container.  Son of a bitch.  And then seal it.  What's the ghetto shit are you buying, Opie?  I'm only three years behind.  Jesus Christ.  They got even newer shit now.  Travis helped me out.  Travis's wife.  Yeah.  And then you open up the top.  I'm sucking a cock, but I'm eating a banana.  You open up the top.  It's a big plastic bag filled with dirty diapers.  There's a...  Cutter.  Like Link's sausage?  A cutter.  A cutter. 
[02:39:30]  So you cut the bag.  Tie it.  Yes!  Tie the top, and then there you go.  It's all self-contained.  You throw it down the garbage chute.  Such a guinea.  Like I'm making a sausage.  Hey, like sausage.  Why aren't people using those things in, like, more pranks?  Like throwing them at people and stuff.  It'll be funny.  Diapers?  The rolled up ones, like sausage links.  It's a sausage...  He's right.  It's a sausage link filled with shitty diapers.  Like Christmas decor.  Like Garland.  That's the one thing I'm afraid of, is the baby shit.  I'm really...  Well, you wrote me yesterday.  I read the text.  I just don't know how much baby shit I'm going to be able to take, because I'm a... 
[02:40:00]  We know you're very sensitive.  Yeah.  The only way I can explain it, when, you know, it's your kid, it doesn't matter.  But if I smell someone else's baby shit, it's horrendous.  But for some reason, it's not the same when you know it's your kid's.  But I did tell you last night...  Let's see if that works.  Smell my dick.  I did tell you last night, though.  What the hell is this?  What?  Oh, sorry, Joe.  It's terrible.  Smell my dick.  It's fucking genius. 
[02:40:30]  You like baby shit?  Yeah.  Smell my dick, kid.  How about this?  You do know that babies will shit all the way up to the back of their neck, right?  I'm sorry.  What did you say to me?  That will happen.  Why?  It's a phenomenon no one has been able to figure out yet.  Not even the diaper people?  No.  They haven't figured out how to stop babies from shitting all the way up to the back of  their neck?  It will go all the way to the back of their neck.  Remember when you rode your bicycle through a mud puddle?  I don't know what it is.  And you didn't have a rear fender? 
[02:41:00]  That's one thing.  That's what they look like.  That's one thing they haven't figured out.  It looks like a Jackson Pollock painting.  Every once in a while, you'll get one that's to the back of his neck.  Yeah, fucking...  I'm looking at clothes the other day, too, for this kid that grows out of it in fucking  two weeks.  No joke.  It's like $60 for a sweater.  Yeah, because someone decided, fuck this.  Why make it reasonable?  This is a big business.  Everybody and their fucking mother has a baby clothing line.  Yep.  And it's really expensive. 
[02:41:30]  You should have...  If you've got a registry, pick out stuff that they can wear six months, a year, all  the way up to two years.  Fuck it.  It's like I'm watching a foreign movie with the subtitles turned off.  I have no fucking idea what you guys are yapping about.  I told you last night, the only time you...  I hope you accidentally get one of these girls pregnant.  No!  That made me so happy.  I know.  Once I have that period, I throw them out.  I think it's beyond amazing, doesn't it?  I have at least one out there. 
[02:42:00]  Ah, stop!  One's going to be knocking on your door, and then you're going to be confused, because  it's going to be a 17-year-old girl.  I think the fucking...  I think the booze fights the fucking...  I'll be all confused.  Hey, Dad.  Hi, hi.  Come on in.  Hey, come on in.  You like movies?  Yeah, I got a theater in the basement.  But when your kid is sick, then the shit really smells bad.  That'd be a great sitcom, is just a guy like you.  Forced to have a kid.  Womp, womp, womp, womp, womp, womp.  Yeah, and then I'm fucking forced to have a kid. 
[02:42:30]  No, no, no, no.  I'm hoping the booze or the fucking liver enzymes kill any sperm that I have.  That'd be a great reality show.  Would it?  Yeah.  Or the reality show of me not having a kid acting like a madman every night of the week.  I think I like that one better.  I like you having a kid and still acting like a madman.  Like, just a bunch of creepy pot smokers passing around your baby.  Yeah, that'd be great.  And then DCS shows up.  Bring the kid.  Bring the kid.  Hey, what the fuck?  How many months out of you?  Where's your kid, Anthony? 
[02:43:00]  I don't know.  He's playing with a gun upstairs.  Yeah, the kid's just fucking twirling a gun around with his Legos.  He's just eating bullets.  Yeah.  Bobby.  My kid is four months, right?  No, I don't know.  Oh.  Yeah, we're halfway through, man.  It's four months.  She's four months pregnant.  What do you call it?  A kid?  Nah, it's just a thing.  Boy or girl.  They have that connection.  Boy or girl.  I actually read a whole article.  Boy or girl.  Oh, sorry, dude.  It's a boy.  It's a boy.  It's a boy.  Hold on.  Before we move on to the next thought, this guy's going to back up my other thing. 
[02:43:30]  Ned Nutt.  So you yell at the girls that come to your house?  Yeah, Bobby, you're in deep trouble.  Opie's totally right.  When my kid was little, he had an explosive diarrhea episode, and I had diarrhea coming  out both legs and out the top of the diaper everywhere.  I don't know.  They haven't.  Not every time, but every once in a while, you get one right up to the back of the neck.  Okay.  It's when they get sick.  Okay.  Here you go.  You're at the mall. 
[02:44:00]  Are you prepared for yellow and green poop?  I'm not prepared for poop.  It starts out as yellow.  Well, it starts out as tar, which is almost impossible.  Wipe off their tiny little enemies.  I have those shits after a Guinness night.  I do.  I swear.  It's like fucking tar.  It's tar.  I've had to install air conditioning units on rooftops, and they've got to seal it with  this stuff called Karnak.  It's like a big red can of tar, and you just full smear it.  There have been days where I've woken up from a night at Guinness, shit, and been like,  I could seal a fucking AC curb with this. 
[02:44:30]  It's like trying to get the...  I don't know if that's good.  You actually shit your liver out.  Yeah.  I wish.  This is the shit that's like packing in there.  Oh, my liver's got to look like an old fucking bong bowl that you find.  Like a fucking pipe.  Are you ready for a new pipe?  Your liver looks like a wild mushroom.  Are you ready for a new liver?  Anytime, I guess, if someone wants to offer one, I'll take it.  My uncle just got a liver transplant from my other uncle.  Did they go out drinking to celebrate?  They take a little piece? 
[02:45:00]  They take a little piece from my other uncle, give it to my other uncle.  Livers have three lobes.  That's crazy.  There's three lobes of a liver.  And you can use one, and the other one will be fine.  You don't have to give the whole thing up.  The uncle that gave the liver is fine.  He was walking around.  My other uncle is actually...  It's a long recovery for the guy who gets the liver.  Yeah, but he's...  At least he gets the liver.  That's something he needs.  He's getting his shit together.  I've had checkups.  They've checked my liver enzymes and function and everything.  It's fine.  If you...  Can I ask you a question?  If you could give him a liver, and he needed the liver, would you give him the liver? 
[02:45:30]  No.  I don't know.  I wouldn't give my brother a fucking piece of my liver.  I ain't giving any body parts out to anybody.  To roll of the dice, my friend.  If your brother was going to die...  Yeah.  And you could give him a liver.  He's going to die.  And you could give him a piece of your liver.  We all die sometime, Red.  I got a bad feeling about this, Bob.  I mean, the real answer, if one of my brothers, you know, it would suck, but you got to go there. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  My sister needed a kidney transplant, and my mother called me up, and she's like, you know,  your sister's very sick.  I have a joke about it in my act I do sometimes.  Is that a child's knee?  What's that?  I need the kidney transplant.  I don't know.  Fucking medical.  I hate fake chip.  Fake chip is just as bad, if not worse, than real chip, I know.  Fake chip is just as worse.  So what happened with the kidney?  My mother was like, you know, I was like, she's very sick. 
[02:46:30]  Both her kidneys are done.  She's got to go to dialysis four times a week.  And I was like, holy shit.  And she's like, okay, so you have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.  I'm like, I'm good.  I feel good.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  I just got to check.  She's like, no, to give her a kidney.  I'm like, I have like gigs.  You know what I mean?  Like good gigs coming up.  I have gigs.  Did you?  Yeah.  How's it sound?  And she was like, Bobby, are you?  And I'm like, look, man, I like my sister, you know, she, but we don't really talk that 
[02:47:00]  much.  It's like, you know, and then I wound up, she wound up getting the kidney from our next  door neighbor, the next door neighbor, Neil.  What a stroke of luck moving in there.  You move in, you get a house.  You don't think you're going to lose a fucking kidney over it to your neighbor.  You might lose a lawnmower.  Remember that fucking kidney I gave you?  Right.  Yeah.  But Neil, he looks exactly what Neil, what a Neil would look like.  Oh God.  He's like, I'll do it.  We were like, relax.  She didn't want the kidney from Neil. 
[02:47:30]  She didn't like Neil.  She didn't even want.  We had to talk her into it, have a family intervention.  And I'm like, wow.  And I actually took her side because I wouldn't have took Neil's kidney either.  Did you get tested to see at least you were a match for her?  We all got tested, but people were relieved when you weren't people walked out of the  room.  Like they just hit the fucking mega millions.  Yeah.  It's like, do they look like American Idol?  They're holding the negative thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But my mother was like, so you can do it?  No, I can't.  No, I'm done.  Or were you like, man, I really was hoping. 
[02:48:00]  No, nobody.  You have to make me.  Yeah.  You know what?  I really was hoping I was a match.  Giving a fucking kidney is not, I don't have a dot on my license.  I want nothing to do with it.  I love how they tell you too.  It's like, wait, you know what?  You have two kidneys and people have functioned completely fine on one kidney and lived a long  and prosperous life.  It's like, yeah.  You know what?  I've been in planes too.  And if one engine went out, all I'd be doing is staring at that other engine going, please  don't go out because it's called having a safety valve right there. 
[02:48:30]  Here it is too.  It's called, God gave me two kidneys.  Yeah.  And if one of my kidneys goes, I give her my kidney.  The other kidney goes because I have the same shit as her.  Now she has the good kidney and now who's giving me a fucking kidney?  You're left with a bum kidney.  And then I go to heaven and God's like, what'd you do?  I gave you two.  I gave you the kidney.  I wanted to talk to her.  I gave her two.  I wanted to talk to her.  Now she's down there and you're up.  I didn't want to see you.  Get out of here.  Now God's mad at me.  I don't want God to be mad at me.  Oh, it's the Cubs. 
[02:49:00]  It's the Cubs sneeze times.  Bobby.  I'll sit here.  Well, let's take a break and we'll get David Duchovny in.  Is that all right?  All right.  Do this proper and shit.  I can sit over here.  Yes.  I can sit over here.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Drew Boogie, can we play your new song until break?  Oh, what is this, Drew?  Yes.  Why not?  It's called I'm in Chains.  It's called I'm in Chains.  It's inspired by an Ant Rant.  Oh, by me?  Yes, by you.  Short version, full version, or original version?  Well, that's up to you.  You're the runner of the shit.  I'm only a full version.  Yeah, but I don't know which one is which.  How long is the full version? 
[02:49:30]  A full version is like four minutes.  It's short version is two.  And what's the original version?  Oh, that's an afterthought.  That's only if someone says, hey, where's that from?  Oh, it's the bit probably.  No, not the bit.  Not the bit.  It's something else.  Oh, okay.  It's something not to be played, Opie, I would gather.  I trust you.  We'll go four minutes.  All right.  Drew Boogie's new song called I'm in Chains, debuting it here on the show.  David Duchovny next.  Bob Kelly in studio playing Bananas in Hasbrook Heights, New Jersey, all weekend long. 
[02:50:00]  Friday, Saturday.  That's it.  Oh, Friday and Saturday.  You said that.  Right.  Friday and Saturday.  Bananas.

[02:51:00]  Stop it. Once you vote white, you know. You vote right. Right. Like what? Can I wear one of those out and not be beaten to a pole? It's time for Whitey to realize we don't have to be victims anymore.  I'm in chains. I'm in chains. My freedom of speech is in chains. I'm the one in chains now. I'm in chains. 
[02:51:30]  Because I can't say what I want to say. Oh, let me know. How long do we pay?  I hope the Kool-Aid's cold. I hope it's icy cold. Drink it up, my friend. Drink up the Obama Kool-Aid.  How long do we pay? How long do we pay? Before people fucking act like human fucking beings.  I'm in chains. I'm in chains. My freedom of speech is in chains. I'm the one in chains now. 
[02:52:00]  I'm in chains. Because I can't say what I want to say. Oh, let me know.  How long do we pay?  Drink it up, get up. Drink it up, my friend. Drink up, drink up, drink up the Obama Kool-Aid.  Drink it up, get up, drink it up, my friend. Drink up, drink up, drink up the Obama Kool-Aid.

[02:53:30]  Let me know how long do we pay  Because I can't say what I want to say  Oh, let me know how long do we pay  I'm fucking exhausted. I'm going to need a nap.  And now Jim Norton interviews legendary actor Alan Alda.  Sorry, Alan, I just cut a gasser in your face.  Thank you. Oh, boy, listen to that. 
[02:54:00]  So, let's get to the meat of the issue.  You had AIDS. How long did you have AIDS for?  I think about six months.  I was really lucky. I must have had a light cage.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Alan, you were a bit of a disappointment.  Thank you very much.  It was fun talking.  Toot-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee 
[02:54:30]  I hope you're right there, David Duchovny. 
[02:55:00]  Like the old days.  Let's jump right into this.  Bob Kelly in the studio and, of course, David Duchovny, who's been doing our show for years.  I don't know how many years.  A long time now.  Exactly.  Yeah, we're discussing Bob Kelly having a kid at 40, what did you say, two?  Two.  I'm 42 years old.  Yeah, it's crazy.  I'm going to be an old man having to play with my, you know, hey, Dad, want to go throw the ball?  I can't.  Yeah.  I can't.  I think about things like going with my dad to some of the school functions and stuff.  And there was always that kid that kind of had the dad that couldn't really do the things. 
[02:55:30]  I always talk about getting rotator cuff surgery so I can have a catch.  Yeah, if you've got to have those surgeries to do that, it could be a problem.  Yeah, there it is.  A bad knee.  I'm trying to lose weight.  My goal is to lose 40 pounds by the time the kid's born because I can't even walk my dogs  and pick up their shit.  Like, I have to, like, stretch out and hold my breath and, like, you know, pull my jeans  up to bend down.  And so when are you going to start? 
[02:56:00]  I already started.  Oh.  Bobby has been, we've been torturing him a bit about his weight over the years.  I'm one of those people.  I'm on my six fat.  He's on his six fat.  I'm like, I'm Oprah.  I have Oprah disease.  Yeah, I go up and down.  I go up and down.  Yeah.  You're giving yourself seven, I think.  I give myself eight fats.  Eight fats.  But I think, like, you know, the fucking deficit, which is, you're moving it up.  No, no, no.  I have eight fats.  I think you still only have five.  He's heading toward the fat cliff.  Yeah. 
[02:56:30]  He's got a fat debt ceiling.  I'm going, I'm going to get skinny again and then I'm going to get fat again.  And that's it.  You know, when life gets a little more comfortable, when the kid's a little older and we start  doing family vacations, I'm going to get a little fat again.  Then I'm going to get in shape again because of some type of disease or I get cancer.  Jesus Christ.  Because I have to get thin.  And then.  You've got it mapped out.  When they finally go, nothing's going to help, I'm going to go, fuck it.  I'm out.  And I'm going to go and just go to wiener schnitzel and honey buns and German restaurants and just,  yeah.  You like German food. 
[02:57:00]  Ah, I went last night.  Did you see that photo?  I went to Halo Berlin where you just get big wiener schnitzels and one of them.  I thought you said you had a diet.  It's the Atkins version.  Oh, you're okay to go there.  It's a lot of wiener schnitzels.  It's actually, it's a leaner schnitzel.  Did you order the wiener schnitzel?  Is that what it's called?  Come on.  I've got to get in the restaurant business.  But one of the wiener schnitzels looks exactly like a penis. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, Jesus.  I mean.  Well, if you cut a penis in thirds.  That's what I do to my penises.  I can't take the whole penis.  That's terrible.  My God.  Enough about you, Bobby.  What does this have to do with Californication?  Six seasons.  Great show.  Californication.  Thank you.  Starting up again, right?  Sunday.  Sunday.  Sunday.  Showtime.  Now, what season is this, by the way?  Six.  Holy shit.  Wow.  Six seasons, all right?  Yeah.  My God.  How long were you on X-Files? 
[02:58:00]  Nine.  Wow.  You were on nine and then it went on.  I'm tired.  It went on in that crappy version, though, after you were gone.  Well, no.  I actually did a full seven, then I did half of eight, and then nine, I came back at the  very end.  You threw him a bone on that last one.  Oh, look.  He's got the fish hooks in his cheeks.  Oh, he's on this week.  Oh, you remember.  Oh, please.  That's a good one.  Of course you remember.  Like, where's Duchovny, for the love of Christ?  I love this guy in Terminator 2, but enough.  He fucking doesn't age.  Yeah, that guy from Terminator 2 aged in like a week.  He looks like he's 85.  I think he's in a new movie.  Yeah.  But Duchovny doesn't age. 
[02:58:30]  No, not at all.  It's the leaner schnitzel.  That's what it does.  You're doing something, right?  Cutting it in thirds.  Wow.  Are you still psyched with every season, like going in there?  Not really.  No, no, no.  No, no.  It's a great job, because the cable kind of schedule, it's 12 weeks.  We shoot 12 episodes in 12 weeks.  Wow.  Wow.  We're really fond of each other, all the actors and the crew.  We've had the same people for six years, seven coming up. 
[02:59:00]  And, you know, it's just nice to, it's like a family reunion every year.  It's not one of those shows where a main character dies every couple of weeks?  No.  Like, ah, what happened to that guy?  Well, we never know if we're going to get canceled or not, so I die every year, basically.  I mean, I have to kind of try to kill me off.  You've had some guys die over the years?  Yeah.  Not like when you're watching, like, Game of Thrones or something like that, or one of those  shows where it's like somebody's just dropping dead.  The king dies.  You know, the actor must read that and be like, really? 
[02:59:30]  Fuck me.  I thought I was in with the king.  That's crazy to go from nine years and now to six.  I mean, most actors don't even get that one.  Your career is, that's great.  You made some good movies in between, though.  Yeah, California.  Yeah.  That was one of my favorite movies.  That still is one that if it comes on, I will turn that motherfucker around.  People bring that up.  Yeah.  I can't even remember it at all.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They'll bring it up.  You don't mind a Brad Pitt talking like that?  Yeah, I do.  Did he talk like that? 
[03:00:00]  Got a bull on the run, Brad!  I'm remembering that.  Yeah.  When he shoots a guy on the run, I remember, he's like, got him on the run, Brad!  Like you're going to be all proud of him.  Hey, look what I did.  That's all you remember from your experience.  That and when I hit him with a shovel, at the end, he goes, Brad came back.  Now it's all coming back.  Now it's all coming back to you.  Maybe we should do that thing where 20 years later, we'd switch roles.  Right. 
[03:00:30]  Yes.  And he plays your role.  And I do him.  You got it down.  I'm sounding a little like Lincoln.  Lincoln.  Two pigs were in a barn.  That's the new way Lincoln sounds now.  And one pig said to the other.  The Daniel Day-Lewis version of a higher voice or something.  Yeah, a gravelly kind of high voice.  It's a big controversy about how he plays.  High voice.  Yeah.  How did they know?  A horse was talking to a chicken.  He told the worst stories.  Oh, Lincoln, enough.  Our finest president.  Yeah.  Only talks about barnyard animals.  When you, when you, were you proficient in shooting handguns during the X-Files or anything else? 
[03:01:00]  No.  I suppose I was, I was okay.  I don't, I've never really shot.  I mean, I've gone a couple of times to the range when we were, when we were starting to do the show.  But, but they take it like Quantico and yeah, I was at Quantico.  It was really interesting.  And, uh, Quantico, I don't know.  Quantico is where they, it's like the headquarters of the FBI where they, where they train the guys.  Right.  So you've got to go down there and train.  It's, it's, it's in outside of DC. 
[03:01:30]  And the most interesting thing that I remember from that is that, um, I was talking to one of their, one of the teachers, one of the head guys.  And he said, uh, the most important, he was talking about shooting.  So the most important thing we teach agents is when you get shot, you don't have to die.  Yeah.  Because, because people will die of non, non-mortal wounds because you, you panic.  Right.  Basically you, you get shot and you think I'm supposed to die and you do.  How do you keep calm and, and, and keep your wits about you? 
[03:02:00]  Yeah.  It's just in my heart.  It's a sucking chest wound.  I think I'm okay.  You could shoot me around eight times and it wouldn't hit me anywhere.  Yeah.  You died from getting shot in the foot.  Yeah.  You hear some of these stories of these agents that have been shot in the arms and stuff.  And they're still just laying rounds out at the other guy.  Yeah.  I saw Bond.  That's it.  Yes, exactly.  Bond.  Right.  Wow.  Maybe it was that.  That is a tough mother.  Maybe it had nothing to do with it.  You got shot up pretty good in that movie.  I still haven't seen it.  Are you kidding?  I've got two kids.  I haven't seen a movie in a while. 
[03:02:30]  I actually went to the shooting range with Daniel Craig and, uh, yeah.  And, uh, he shot, I, I own a, a, a, a Barrett 50 caliber sniper rifle.  Oh, so you're a pro.  Yeah.  I like shooting.  It's fun.  Uh, and, and he shoot, he shoots it and he, he literally goes, Jesus fucking hell.  He yells it.  It just, it kicked the shit out of him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He wasn't bad though with the pistols.  The rifles left a little to be desired, but yeah.  You're saying that about Bond?  Yeah.  You know what? 
[03:03:00]  Why would you say that?  He's got great video that he just can't post, unfortunately.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  For some reason, I guess they don't want to show him actually shooting real guns.  Right.  Right.  You know, in the movies, it's okay and stuff, but to have him shooting real guns.  Yeah, but I know a guy who really got shot and he said it, it hurts really bad.  I would assume.  Like, you can't, you can't just get up.  That's surprising.  You can't get up.  Can we call the AP?  You can't just get up and start running after a guy after you get shot.  No.  You're going to lie there and go, ow, ow.  I just started taking my son boxing because I want him to actually know that all that stuff is crap. 
[03:03:30]  You know, that it does hurt when you get hit and to defend himself.  Oh, wow.  And he started watching professional wrestling, too, and he thinks it's hysterically funny.  And I'm beginning to understand why it's so popular.  Yeah.  Because 10-year-olds love it.  Yeah.  And people from Aruba.  And 30-year-olds.  Yeah, 30-year-olds.  And 42-year-olds.  He is one of the...  Really?  Can I ask you, what is it you love about it?  It's just...  It's so entertaining.  What's entertaining about it?  I mean, you got to like certain guys.  One of my favorites, The Rock, when he was on, you know, Dwayne.  Sure.  Right? 
[03:04:00]  He's one of the funniest guys on the planet on TV.  He really was funny.  He's just hilarious.  I don't think it has so much to do with exactly only what they're doing in the ring.  I think it's the peripheral storylines and stuff.  That's at least what he tells me.  It's like a soap opera.  Theatrix.  Yeah.  Theatrix.  It's ridiculous.  A soap opera.  Very good.  There's a continuing storyline.  You can laugh at it.  You're like, oh, my God.  I was watching it yesterday with my son.  They just fake ran over somebody with a limousine.  And you saw the guy not get hit, but you're like, he's holding his knee.  Yeah.  Villains and heroes. 
[03:04:30]  And Bobby, they barely wear anything.  Jesus.  Jesus Christ.  Is that what you're up for?  No, that's...  Oh, it's up with Bobby out.  That's not wrong.  It's not about the tiny little...  Well, I grew up a long time ago in the city.  You know, professional wrestling went into hibernation for a good 20 years.  But when I was a kid, it was big.  Right.  It was small.  It was on...  Who were your guys?  Andre the Giant?  That type of thing?  No.  Bruno San Martino.  Pedro Morales.  Bruno San Martino.  Bruno.  Yeah.  Emil Mascaris.  A Thousand Masks.  He's nodding over that. 
[03:05:00]  A Thousand Masks.  He knows everything.  Classy Freddie Blassie.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Freddie Blassie.  Chief J Strongbow.  Yes.  Was that when it was, like, on Channel 11 here, like some local station?  That's when you could go after...  No, it was on UHF.  Oh, damn, right.  Remember that?  I do remember.  You had to go over.  Do you remember the match where it was so bad they put tape across the lens so you couldn't  see it?  The blood?  The blood?  X?  This was the blood?  I forgot who the wrestler was, but they said, this is so outrageous that you can't see 
[03:05:30]  it.  Oh, my God.  And they actually put tape over the fucking camera.  Remember what Freddie Blassie used to call his opponents?  Pencil?  Pencil neck geeks.  Yeah.  Okay.  Fantastic.  That's back, though, when you could actually go to the bar right near the arena, and then  you could hang with them.  They'd be doing coke and beating people up.  They'd try to rape your girlfriend.  Andrew would be holding a girl by the neck.  Those were the days.  Yeah.  That's what he's trying to say.  Those were the days.  What a blast.  What does that have to do with Californication?  We've got to make sure that people know the success starts Sunday.  Sunday.  Sunday.  What kind of hijinks and shenanigans are you into this time? 
[03:06:00]  We're all rock and roll this year.  We've got this guy, Tim Minchin, from Great Britain, who's an amazing musical talent.  He does, like, funny political songs.  You should Google him.  They're really smart.  Manson, Sebastian Bach.  Marilyn Manson.  Yeah, Steve Jones.  So we're rock and rolling this year.  Wow.  They're trying to make a musical of one of Hank's novels.  Really?  Like a Jesus Christ superstar.  Very cool.  That's a good storyline.  Yeah.  And, of course, the women.  There's a lot of women. 
[03:06:30]  Maggie Grace.  Yep.  Yes.  Of course, the returning Natasha McElhone, who's eternally beautiful.  And I'm blanking on anybody else.  I love Maggie Grace.  I follow her on the Twitter.  Do you?  Does she tweet?  Does she tweet?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, she tweets.  She's very pretty.  You like her tweets?  I think they're cute.  They're fun.  All right.  They're sassy.  He follows beautiful women.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I've never been on the Twitter.  No.  I've looked for David Duchovny.  There's a few imposters, by the way.  I've never read a Twitter. 
[03:07:00]  You've never even read one?  I don't know what a hashtag is.  You're better off.  David.  You're better off.  I think I'm better off.  You really are.  You like it?  You like it?  No, it's taxing.  Do you want to read one for the first time?  It's all encompassing.  On the air?  Not to do with myself.  No, it's me.  That's great.  Read that one right there.  Not to do with myself.  Can you make it big for the old man?  Yeah, right?  What are you doing?  That's too small for me.  I've got to put on my sunglasses.  Yes.  Prescription?  Yeah, this is why Twitter is so good.  Stop one?  Right here.  Yep.  Hey, Bobo?  Oh, no.  Hey, Bobo. 
[03:07:30]  Remember that time you...  Go ahead.  Why don't you read it?  Yeah, yeah.  You spread your a-hole for Robert Kelly and made him puke because of your dirty A.  See what you're missing?  See what you're missing, David.  See what you're missing on Twitter?  See what you're missing?  You sure you don't want to be part of this?  Hey, sure you don't want to sign up and...  See that.  Do chickens were...  See how big this text is on my phone?  It's not even big enough for me.  Is it really?  Is it terrible?  My phone looks like an iChart.  Does it?  The top part of it. 
[03:08:00]  Yeah.  I get one letter per screen.  You just scroll for a letter.  You're not missing a thing.  You really are.  It's just abuse.  You get all tied up in these arguments that you wouldn't give anybody the time of day  about in real life, talking face-to-face, and then you get caught up in them.  I don't know why.  What is this?  What the hell are we doing?  It's kind of an instant gratification thing.  I don't know.  But the abuse kind of hurts, doesn't it?  Yes, it does.  I don't enjoy it at all, David.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  Literally, you wake up happy. 
[03:08:30]  I love life.  Hey, honey.  I'll see you later.  Today's going to be a great day.  I've got a lot of stuff.  And then you go to your Twitter.  You'll be like, boy, you're a fat fuck.  You should die.  I hate you.  What the fuck did I do to anybody?  And that's his wife.  That was actually a text.  Yeah, she's got one of those.  That was actually an email from my mother and my wife.  Your wife has one of those Nick Avatar accounts.  One follower.  Those are the worst, too.  Eight million tweets.  Yeah, because you don't even know who these people are.  He has like one follower.  You don't even know.  He could be your mother. 
[03:09:00]  It could literally be your mother that hates your guts.  You fat fuck.  You're nobody.  Move back to Boston.  Yeah, no picture of this.  All you want to do is take your dog for a walk.  The worst is when you see somebody who starts attacking the other person.  You do it, but you have fun with it.  But there's some people that try to actually teach people lessons through 140 characters.  And the guy says it's long.  And then the guy would just be like, yeah, fuck you, fag.  And he just, it's it.  It's like, oh.  And that's an argument.  Forget about it.  And do you have any kind of internet presence at all? 
[03:09:30]  Presence?  No.  Facebook?  No.  No Facebook.  You had a MySpace, though.  I was a fan.  He's a guy.  No, I'm kidding.  No, I get all these invitations to join something called LinkedIn, which I never heard about.  But I never do it.  I wouldn't either.  You don't need that shit.  I've never been on the Facebook.  I saw the movie.  Yes.  I never tweeted, never read one.  I bet there are David Duchovny imposters all over Twitter.  There were.  There were.  Did you crack down on that?  We tried, I think. 
[03:10:00]  But I don't think it's illegal for some reason.  No, I don't think it is.  I think as long as you're not trying to present yourself really as the person, you could.  Yeah.  You could put up parody accounts, they call them.  They have a fake, I am Colin Quim.  Yeah, Colin Quim got me the other day.  I responded to him like it was Colin.  Yeah.  And then I blocked the guy because I'm all mad at him.  Ah, you fooled me.  I hate that.  I hate being fooled on the internet.  You don't like being fooled on the internet.  No.  There's been a couple of knocks on my door and I've been fooled at the internet.  Hey, you have an Adam's apple.  Wait a minute.  This isn't right. 
[03:10:30]  You don't look like the picture.  You have an Adam's apple.  Get in here.  Good for you.  Should I get on the Facebook?  No.  You're really not missing anything.  You aren't missing a thing.  God bless people like you, David Duchovny, because I'm wrapped up in everybody that's on the internet  and that's all you think about.  But when I go home, I'm watching TV and I'm constantly on the phone looking at Twitter  and stuff and it's a giant waste of time.  People are going to have neck problems because we're all looking down.  If you look at like a subway platform, it's all people looking down with their necks bent 
[03:11:00]  at their phone.  I think we're going to evolve into like swans.  That's why they're getting pushed over the side.  They're not paying attention.  Yeah, really.  That's why they're getting pushed.  Stop looking at your phone.  I grew up in New York and I remember when they first put down that strip of good grabbing  material.  Yeah.  I was like, what kind of message are they sending here?  It's like, okay, this is your last chance to get a good foothold.  Right?  They didn't used to have that.  No, it was just cement.  You can really dig your heel in.  Yeah, yeah.  And you know they had a meeting saying, all right, we've got to give these people one 
[03:11:30]  last chance before they go over the side.  But I think people would look and they go, well, let me see if I, let me see if you could  save himself.  I was like, oh.  I wonder if there was a testing platform that they pushed people.  I do remember this, and this may or may not be true, but it could be apocryphal.  But in the early 70s, the MTA sent out for subway cars to Japan because they were making  the best subway cars and cheaper, I guess.  And then we got them and they came to the States. 
[03:12:00]  And the problem was they were great and they ran well, but the average Japanese ass is so  much smaller that the seats, the ridge of the seat would go right up your crack.  So it's, you know, these little things that nobody figured out.  So you actually get the subway car.  Until I get on the car, and I'm like, what the fuck's going on here?  Yeah, that would, well, you would.  For you, it might go, right?  Yeah, it might actually work.  It might be perfect if you could get cheeks on each seat.  Cheek on each seat.  It's actually perfect, my fat ass.  These are great new seats. 
[03:12:30]  I actually so paranoid of getting pushed now that I stand backwards and I scan.  But now I look like the guy who's going to push somebody.  Who's going to push someone.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're all the way in the back.  You're looking around.  I'm just paranoid.  Just hang back with the guys who are playing the blues.  Yeah, they'll.  And the odds are good.  The acapella guys.  Yeah.  The guy with the bongo.  The odds are good.  You need three guys that all are thinking to push you over the side.  Oh.  Oh.  Three guys?  Three guys.  Oh.  He's a bigger one.  Oh, okay. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, but no one's going to push you is what I'm saying.  I know.  I'm not going to help you.  The subway train was just going to help you with the bomb.  When Bob Kelly was pushed in front of it.  Yeah.  The subway train.  First man lives.  People on the train were hurt.  I thought about it when it happened.  And you always think, well, why don't you run across to the other side?  Yeah.  You would think.  I guess you'd just freeze.  Well, also maybe that he was injured.  It's a six-foot fall.  It's a six-foot fall onto metal and wood.  I think it's kind of like shaking it off and going, oh, shit. 
[03:13:30]  You can still crawl.  Do something.  Try something.  I've already done the scenario in my head.  There's no time.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  You don't do that?  You don't like the train's coming.  All right, now someone just pushed me.  What would I do?  So you're at the platform.  The train is coming.  No wonder people are looking at you strange.  You're imagining.  Yeah.  You're imagining.  He's like this.  Doing the math in his head.  He's got a tape measure.  Why?  100?  I've been here for 10 years.  I haven't enjoyed one day of New York City.  No.  I'm mugged.  I'm stressed out all the time. 
[03:14:00]  I walk my dogs.  I look for weapons.  First thing I do is I look for a weapon.  You do?  Oh, when I walk out at like 12 at night walking my dogs?  Yeah, I look for a weapon.  How about you get a gun?  No, I can't.  Why?  I live in Manhattan.  Not everyone can get a gun.  Not everybody, yeah.  Not everybody can get a...  Hey, sorry.  Not everybody's a cowboy.  They've got grandfathered in.  There might be a gun in the studio.  No, I never carry in the studio.  It's terrible.  I would use it by accident.  I would use it.  Yeah.  By accident?  I wouldn't shoot anybody, but I'd be like, you know, what are you looking at, mother?  And I'd take it out.  Oh, you're brandish. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, I'm crazy.  Yeah, you do that with like a stick.  It's not that bad.  You can only do that in the movie.  No, you should do it with a stick.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why I don't want a gun.  And then you do it with a stick and someone shoots you.  That's great.  That sounds great.  You working on any movies?  I just finished up a movie in Connecticut called After the Fall, and I got a movie coming  out March 1st called The Phantom with Ed Harris, which is a Cold War Russian submarine  film.  It's really cool.  Really.  And that Ed Harris is pretty goddamn good.  Everybody loves Ed Harris.  I like Ed Harris.  I liked him in that Apollo 13. 
[03:15:00]  He was very good.  Do you watch that movie, Apollo 13?  Yes, I did.  Bobby, because I was imagining you would probably get a little choked up at the end.  When Ed Harris sits down, he goes, kind of wipes his eyes, a manly guy, but he's tearing  up.  I tear up.  I tear up.  But you know what I learned?  Surprises make me cry.  What?  Anytime there's a surprise.  I think it's the right time for you to have a child.  Well, this Korean dude on HGTV got his mother and his Korean parents a kitchen, and they  came in, and they were like, oh, this is my kitchen. 
[03:15:30]  And I was just like, oh, my God.  You started crying out of Bobby.  Bobby's a sensitive guy, man.  He's got sensitive eyes.  He does.  He's a very funny stand-up comic.  I love your bit on Move That Bus.  Yeah, I cry at that.  He cries just to Move That Bus.  I can't watch that.  Move That Bus, but they all start cheering.  I did that show.  Did you?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Did you cry?  No.  He was on the show.  No.  You don't cry so much when you're on the show, because it's all kind of...  Because you know that all the stuff is going to be stolen six months later? 
[03:16:00]  I know, but I did it because my whole family was crying at it at the time.  Oh, really?  They were crying?  Well, when they'd watch the show.  Right.  When they watched the Move That Bus part.  Yeah.  Or just the whole thing.  And then they probably watched you and went, look at that insensitive bastard David isn't  even crying.  Did he fake cry at least?  I'm glad you like your home.  Now where's my paycheck, motherfuckers?  I'm sorry.  I got a plan to catch.  And the bus actually, he gets on the bus and takes off with him in it.  Can you move that bus? 
[03:16:30]  Because I got to go.  I got a call time here.  What was the scenario on the show that you did?  Oh, it was a few years ago.  That depends.  I can't.  It was, of course, it was sad, but it wasn't one of those really, really, really.  Like where the father had eight kids, the mother passed away of some disease, and now  he's trying to take care of them.  Right.  Yeah, that's crazy.  And no children were ill or anything like that.  So.  Yeah.  So I'm not saying this is an excuse.  They really didn't need the house, is what you're saying. 
[03:17:00]  I'm not saying that.  They could have done a room, and they would have been fine.  They ran out of sad families.  Yeah, give them a swing set, they would have been fine.  A paint job and maybe a carpet.  Here's a Toyota.  It's a used one.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, David.  Yeah, it's not.  The one that really made me cry was in the old black lady.  They moved the bus, and she fainted.  Oh, she fainted.  Oh, man.  That's the classic one, yeah.  It was on the ground.  I was like, oh.  Oh, Jesus.  You're not human if that doesn't bother.  It's kind of great.  Yeah.  Is it still on?  Yeah, I don't know.  Oh, yeah, it's still on.  He's moving on to another show. 
[03:17:30]  Tie, right?  Yeah.  Something like that.  Yeah, but that show's never going to not go on.  I mean, they have variations of it now.  Yeah.  So, yeah, it's always great.  But, like, you know what I feel bad for?  They did one for Sandy.  These people in, wherever, Jersey.  Long Beach or Jersey Shore.  But what about, there's like five, all the neighbors are like, oh, shit.  Really?  They picked you?  Well, I remember they wanted me to look like I was building, you know, helping build a house.  Oh, there you go.  And I said, well, first of all, I'm not handy.  And secondly, I don't really want to give the illusion that I came here and really helped build. 
[03:18:00]  Right, right.  I mean, I'm happy to be the guy who's here, whatever you like.  My goal cheerleader or something.  Family likes me or something, so I'll meet them.  But I think it's kind of bold.  David swinging a hammer.  I'm like, got the big nail gun put down the floor.  No.  You got a tool belt that's brand new.  Yeah, exactly.  Brand new tools.  I couldn't put the hammer in one nail for the cameras.  I can lift shit.  I'll lift shit.  I'll lift something.  But yeah, yeah.  I'm interested in that movie, Submarine Thing. 
[03:18:30]  So it's Cold War?  Yeah.  Are you American or are you a Ruski?  We're all Russian.  Oh, man.  None of us are doing accents, so it's not.  All right.  I was going to ask you if you had to, you know.  No, because we'd have 17 different accents if we were going to do that.  Yeah.  I like when you do a movie because, you know, the accent thing's fine and dandy if it's  done well.  But I'd rather have no accent because I can accept that.  Right.  You know, why would they be speaking English in an accent anyway?  So it's not.  Well, it's like the bad guys in the old movies always had an English accent.  Yeah. 
[03:19:00]  Especially if they were Nazis.  Yeah.  The Nazis have the English accents in the old movies are great.  No, the idea of the movie is...  That was great.  That was great.  That was great.  Sorry.  This is funny.  I just remembered that.  I just remembered that.  There's a lot of Nazis.  Hello.  All right.  What we want to do is this.  Hitler's going to be quite niffed if we don't get those pans about it.  We all accept it, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You do.  The Jews.  Yeah.  I said that.  So you're all right.  The idea of the film is that from a true story that a Russian nuclear sub did go missing 
[03:19:30]  off the coast of Hawaii in the 70s, I think in the early 70s, and it was a nuclear sub.  So the idea of the phantom in the movie is this device that can kind of capture the oral  signature of other vessels and then cloak itself as the other vessel.  So we go, I'm KGB and I'm stowing away on the ship because we want to start World War  III.  And we capture this Chinese ship's oral signature and we're going to attack. 
[03:20:00]  We're going to fire a nuclear weapon at Hawaii as a Chinese ship to the radar, hoping that  the U.S. will then attack China.  Start World War III.  They annihilate each other.  Russia comes out looking to smell like a rose.  Right.  But Ed doesn't know any of this.  We're stowaways on his ship doing this nefarious stuff.  And when they start to get an idea of what's happening, there's a civil war.  Ah, right.  Ed's one of the good guys.  He's the captain. 
[03:20:30]  And you're a crazy KGB guy that wants to us talk.  How does it end?  Oh, man.  How does it end?  I love submarine movies, man.  Me too.  And we shot it on an actual submarine.  You did?  Was that creepy?  Well, it's just, it's really tight.  It's really small.  Were you claustrophobic or any of that?  I'm not that bad that way.  But I think if it had been in the water, if it had been loose, we were just docked.  So we could just walk out.  Yeah, if you knew it was down under.  When it was San Diego out there. 
[03:21:00]  I saw that movie.  I talked about this on the air a while ago.  Grey Lady Down.  Yeah.  When I used to smoke pot, I watched Grey Lady Down.  And it was a, it wasn't an old, people have commented that it's some old woman porno.  But no.  It was a movie.  What are you doing in there?  I guess it had Chuck Heston in it and David Carradine was in there and stuff.  So it was a good movie.  Oh, yeah.  The sub sunk.  Grey Lady.  Yeah.  Grey Lady Down.  Damn you.  And it hit the bottom, but it was still at people and stuff.  And they're running out of oxygen and the pressure on the whole. 
[03:21:30]  And I'm smoking some weed.  And I'm watching this like, this is such a great, this is, I wonder what it'd be like  to be in there.  I wonder what, oh my God, I wonder what, it would be hard.  I started getting the feeling that I was there.  I had to literally go into my bedroom, curl up in the fetal position on my bed, and  just unfreak myself out.  But that would make you more claustrophobic.  No, I had to unfreak myself out.  Why does that put all the alcohol and pills he took?  No, I just smoked weed back then.  I had a similar experience.  He's got to go? 
[03:22:00]  Not yet.  He's got to go.  He's got a similar experience.  But just talking.  I saw this movie, it was called, I remember it, called The Clonus Horror.  Oh, The Clonus Horror.  Come on.  I remember the name, not the movie, though.  Okay, so, I mean, it's a bad TV movie about cloning from the early 80s.  And I saw it in a tweaked state of mind and freaked out, completely just lost my shit so  badly that I couldn't even think that word clonus, which isn't even a word, for a year. 
[03:22:30]  And then finally I saw it in the TV listings that it was on again.  And I just had to face my fear, so I saw it.  Oh, get on that horse.  I saw it straight, and it was just horrible.  It was a terrible movie.  Boy, yeah.  And not scary at all.  In that altered state of mind, sometimes something gets a hold of you.  Oh, it's frightening.  Peter Graves.  Peter Graves.  Peter Graves is in that one?  The Clonus Horror.  Clonus.  Now I'm going to look that up.  I'll see if Netflix has it.  I mean, we're just going to start with David to come.  David.  I live in New York. 
[03:23:00]  I'll come in any time.  Please do.  Even when I'm not myself.  Love having you on.  You're a fun guy.  I'm a big fan of Californication.  Thank you.  Six seasons starts Sunday.  Sunday.  On Showtime.  10.30.  10.30 on Showtime.  Yes.  Thank you.  Very cool.  Enjoy your weekend, sir.  Thanks.  Good to see you.  That's an issue, buddy.  Congratulations.  Thank you, buddy.  Wait, wait, wait.  Bob Kelly got to get that plug in.  Bob Kelly.  Are you going to continue with Sam?  Get on that.  You give me the plug.  Give me the plug.  Give me the picture with David to him.  Are you continuing with Sam?  Yeah, I'm going to continue with Sam.  All right, good.  But in case people are tapping out, it's Friday.  Yeah, go ahead, Bobby.  Friday, tonight, one show at Bananas in Hasbrook Heights. 
[03:23:30]  Hasbrook Heights, Bananas, and Saturday night, two shows this weekend in Hasbrook Heights,  New Jersey, Bananas.  And the podcast.  Oh, yeah, riotcast.com.  We get 12 of the greatest shows, Davey Mack, Weird Medicine, and mine, YKWD.  You know what, dude?  Podcast on riotcast.com.  Take it right there.  I heard about the picture you took of Chris Christie. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's great.  That's funny.  Yeah.  That's rolling.  All right, well, I guess we're done then.  Thanks, David.  Thank you, Bobby.  Bobby, we'll continue with Sam in a few minutes here.  Have a good weekend.  On the Bob and Sam show.  What do you got there, man?  Well, I'm talking about Stephen Singer and Stephen Singer Jewelers.  Of course, Stephen is a genius when it comes to selecting the right gift.  You screwed up on Christmas.  I know you did.

You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  And now the moment you've waited for rears its ugly nose.  Head.  After O.P. and Anthony Live is coming up next. 
[03:25:30]  SiriusXM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  This is After O.N.A. Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  We're on the air now.  Anthony's still here.  Hi.  It's the weekend.  Rob Kelly's here. 
[03:26:00]  Yo, yo, yo, yo.  Turn my mic on, son.  Yo, yo.  Turn my mic on.  It's on.  Yo, yo, yo, yo.  All right.  DJ Who Kid won't be here until later.  We're just talking German food.  Talking tech.  Oh, tech.  You want to know about tech?  Yeah.  You said that very gay.  Tech Talk with Bobby and Friends.  I got an iMwatch coming in.  Oh, is that one of the new...  What kind is that?  iMwatch.  It's a watch phone. 
[03:26:30]  Basically, your iPhone on a watch.  You're like Dick Tracy.  It syncs up with your iPhone or your Android phone and on your watch.  So you can have your phone in your bag, wherever the fuck it is.  And Bluetooth.  It syncs everything up.  It's fucking incredible.  Yeah, you could like to play music.  Music, tweets, email, everything on it.  Isn't that the same thing on your phone?  Yeah, but it's on your wrist.  Well, why don't you just use your phone?  Because you can leave your phone like in a backpack or in a pocket.  You don't have to keep pulling your phone out.  It's right there on your wrist.  So it's actually the convenience is you don't have to pull your phone out of your pocket anymore. 
[03:27:00]  Amazing.  That's where we've gone to.  Amazing.  Well, it's actually going to where you don't...  You're just looking...  You have like a contact lens.  I've seen that too.  That's not this year.  I've seen that though.  The contact lens.  Yeah, well, they've got the Google Glasses that are coming out.  Google Glasses.  Google Glasses.  Yeah?  The Googles.  How far away are Google Glasses?  Six months.  There they are.  Six months.  Six months.  I've been reading about those dumb Google Glasses for years.  Oh, I can't wait.  And no one's got them yet.  I can't wait.  They don't exist.  No, they don't exist.  First of all, I can't wait to wear glasses. 
[03:27:30]  Yeah?  And have an excuse.  Just walk around wearing Google Glasses.  I can't wait.  Do you think they'll be fashionable or will people go, oh, look, he's wearing Google Glasses?  They'll have fashionable ones, but then they'll have the cheap ones  the black dude sells in front of the Apple store.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's like a Versace, but it's just like a broken V.  Glasses, glasses, glasses.  You have to snap on the stuff.  This is where you snap on an iPhone case.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Just to individualize, snazz it up for yourself.  Snazz it up.  You know.  Yeah.  I like the thought of it, though, but are you going to use it or is it going to be another 
[03:28:00]  electronic device that goes in a drawer somewhere?  I'm tired of those.  Like the phone is the phone.  You carry it with you all the time.  You got it.  You know it's not going to be a fad.  Right.  They can buy these other devices.  You think it's all cool and shit, and it is for like a couple of weeks, and then you've  realized you're not taking it with you as much, and then it just ends up in a  hoarder corner in my house.  Like a bandolier?  Right.  Like a bandolier, let's say.  Those bandoliers come in handy.  That is a little floating game.  And by the way, that's exactly what's going to happen to that watch.  There's no way the watch becomes the thing. 
[03:28:30]  I'll tell you why the watch, the only thing that's going to suck about the watch is battery  life.  That's what Bluetooth stuff sucks, because the battery life, it just, oh, fuck, you forget  to plug it in.  Now you just have these huge headphones that don't work because you didn't plug them in.  You know what I'm saying?  So as soon as they can figure out batteries and make them, you know.  I'm terrible with charging my shit, too.  I wish there was an alternative to that.  I had to go to the Apple store, and I'm like, give me 20 of the new iPhone 5 chargers. 
[03:29:00]  Just give me 20 of them.  And then I took them home, and I just threw them around the house.  I did the same thing.  I just picked them up and threw them.  And then I went to my car, and I tossed a few in there.  Because I'm constantly looking for them.  Get that backpack right there.  They make that, the power bag.  Yeah.  It's called power bag.  It has a battery in it that you can charge.  I call my scrotum.  The power bag.  Nice.  Yeah, motherfucker.  Motherfuckers.  It charges your phone up to, like, four times.  Yeah, but then how do you charge the backpack?  You've got to plug it in. 
[03:29:30]  I'm sorry.  I've got to plug it in my backpack.  And it all seems crazy.  You're going to get back cancer or something.  You can't walk around with batteries on your back.  You're not going to get back cancer.  I'm sorry, you have spine cancer from your backpack.  You have earlobe cancer.  Yeah, it's throwing off all kinds of fucking radio waves.  We already have it.  I don't need it.  We already have it.  I've been putting my fucking phone to my head since the flip phone.  The cell one where it had one line of numbers.  Remember that?  No.  You don't remember cell one?  The first flip phone?  It had just enough room.  Oh, the little window, and you would just see the numbers come up. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah, just the numbers.  No texting.  Remember you had to know somebody's phone number?  I remember those days.  Oh, my God.  I used to have a calculator with the people's numbers in it.  Remember those?  And it had a phone receiver on the end of it, and you pushed a button on the payphone,  and it would dial the number.  Yeah, and it would go like...  That wasn't a thing that everybody had.  That was something that just gadget people got sucked into buying it.  I thought chicks would like it.  I remember I was on a date with a chick.  I pulled over to payphone, and I put it up.  She goes, what are you doing?  Maybe if you put it against her twat, she might like... 
[03:30:30]  I'll see the sounds.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  This is what it sounds like right here.  Delicious.  It sounds like Pop Rocks.  You put Pop Rocks in a pussy.  That didn't sound like Pop Rocks.  Bobby, my last tweet is actually a compliment.  Don't take it the wrong way.  That means take it the wrong way.  If you've got to tell someone that my last tweet was a compliment, don't take it the wrong way.  Let's read the tweet.  Let's read the tweet.  How come Opie doesn't come to a microphone? 
[03:31:00]  Because he's...  It's got to be like, hey, I'm the guy in the back of the class.  Opie cool.  Love when David Duchovny comes in.  Always fits in perfectly.  At Bob Kelly, which is all right, too.  That's not really a compliment.  Is it?  Unfortunately, he was...  Number one, it's Bob Kelly, which nobody owns.  Yeah, they do.  I'm Robert Kelly.  This bald guy owns Bob Kelly.  No, I'm not Bob Kelly.  Now we know you're not really friends.  You just complimented a Wi-Fi guru in Jameson, Pennsylvania. 
[03:31:30]  I'm so glad that this guy, Bob Kelly, is going to get all the shitty tweets from your fans.  The poor fuck doesn't know what he's in for.  Yeah, fuck him.  Fuck him.  Fuck you.  You suck.  I hate his Boston accent.  Delete.  No, you can't delete a tweet.  Are you guys hanging out for the Millionaire Matchmaker?  This...  Oh, that's why I'm here.  Patty Stanger.  Let me tell you something.  I was hanging out just long enough for Chris to bring my truck up. 
[03:32:00]  What?  And now I am fucking out of here.  How do you know it's up?  I know how long about it takes to get the truck.  Actually, he just texted me.  He's stuck in the traffic.  In the traffic?  The traffic.  He's stuck in the traffic.  Okay, the Bob.  Well, the anth.  Great seeing you.  And again, congratulations.  Good seeing you too, buddy.  That's fucking...  That's pretty cold.  I'm very excited.  Little Bobby.  Don't worry.  I won't bring him over to your house.  You know, Bob...  Kids, believe me, my house is very kid-friendly.  Travis and Lisa bring the kid over.  Right.  My brother brings his kid.  My sister brings their kid. 
[03:32:30]  It's fucking...  And his toys, like fucking shit.  They play with their toys in the middle of the floor.  You don't have that potty mouth around these kids, do you?  I gotta be kind of cold.  Sometimes I let one slide.  Right.  But all them I know are potty mouths, so it doesn't matter.  You think my fucking language could be any worse than fucking Travis's wife's?  Stop it.  Travis's wife is bad?  She can throw dirty language around like a champ.  In front of the kid?  Ah, fucking who cares?  In front of everybody.  I'm surprised that all the talk about kids, you didn't talk about Toiletto at all. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah, Toiletto.  Hang on one second.  Sounds tragic.  I gotta get out of here.  Toiletto.  My wife had a miscarriage two years ago.  Terrible.  Yeah, first of all, it was named Toiletto Flush.  Toiletto Flush.  All right.  Hey, I'll listen on the way home.  All right.  Have a great drive.  We're going to-  We're booking an amazing job on that song, by the way.  Really well done.  Fucking great.  It's available on iTunes.  That's right.  Why are you screaming?  All right.  Yeah.  All the mics.  You dropped-  Anthony, you dropped something.  How you doing, man?  He didn't look. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, you didn't tell me about Toiletto Flush.  Well, you know, I don't bring that up every day.  Bobby, the correction has been made.  Awesome.  Now it's at Robert Kelly.  That's it.  At Robert Kelly that you guys actually got from me.  At Robert.  Remember.  She's coming in right now.  Oh, but you hanging out for the Millionaire Matchmaker?  Patty Stanger?  I'm very excited.  I'm a millionaire.  You are?  I'm very excited.  Do you like the show?  From all my video before she comes in.  I'm not going to.  Fuck!  Damn it!  Sorry, buddy.  It's all about the Millionaire Matchmaker right now, Patty Stanger. 
[03:34:00]  What about my show this weekend?  Well, yeah, of course, Bananas in Hasbrook Heights.  Tonight.  Tonight.  One show tonight, because we don't fuck around with you unwashed boxes.  We do 9 o'clock.  Plenty of time to wash them.  Yeah, you can bring your unwashed box tonight, but, you know, make it nice.  Yeah, don't have an attitude about it.  You have plenty of time.  My latest video, I make an incredibly awkward moment in the Superfly Jimmy Snooker interview.  Can I tell you something, Opie?  Yes. 
[03:34:30]  And I'm going to tell you this.  Are you passing it around to the wrestling people?  Yeah, I did.  I retweeted it.  This is a credit to me.  Eric said, remember when Opie said he owned you and turned off your mic?  You should do it to him.  I didn't do that, Opie.  Eric wanted me to.  I'm not going to do that.  That son of a bitch.  That rap bastard.  That son of a bitch.  She's taking this shit, so you can't hear this right now.  DJ Who Kid and Patty standing around outside.  Who Kid's in?  Let's bring them both in.  Let's bring them in.  Who Kid?  Who Kid?  Patty can come in, too, if she wants.  Who Kid, what up, son?  What up?  What up, son? 
[03:35:00]  I'm just saying son today.  I learned my lesson.  Good, good.  I heard I said it wrong.  What are you saying, man?  You want to say, you don't know Who Kid?  I never met him.  I never met him.  Hi, buddy.  How you doing, man?  Nice to meet you, buddy.  Home slice.  Opie, are you leaving or are you staying?  You leaving?  Tell Patty to come in.  He got bitches, man.  He's out of here.  Where's Patty Stanger?  Right there.  Tell her to come in.  What up, Opie?  Come on in, Patty.  Patty.  How are you?  You're famous, man.  Patty's famous.  Of course she is.  Patty's famous.  Patty Stanger.  You're toast and all. 
[03:35:30]  Ooh, look.  The millionaire matchmaker.  She's hot.  Who had a shitty dress?  That's a cocky dress.  She had a great body.  She looked really good last night at the Critics.  I don't know.  Who?  Who did?  Jennifer Lawrence.  Jennifer Lawrence.  I said, what do you mean?  Oh, Jennifer Lawrence.  You didn't like her dress.  You're very critical.  No, I loved her dress last night at the Critics Association.  I thought she nailed it.  She nailed it.  That was the best dress of the night.  You're very critical of a lot of ladies.  But the Daily News, like, come on.  Would you fuck that?  No, right?  I mean, I don't care about the dress. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, I would fuck it.  I would definitely hit that.  Yeah, you would, too.  He looks fine.  Wait, let me tell you something.  She is not a skinny mini.  She's got a great body, and she's showing girls you can look normal.  Patty, this is DJ Who Kid.  He's got a hat on that says, fuck love, get money.  He would, yeah.  Wait, let me say, let me say, fuck love, get money.  Okay.  Would you set up a millionaire woman with somebody who...  Okay, stand up.  I can't, I gotta look at the package.  Let's look at DJ Who Kid.  Okay, first of all, he needs a makeover, and why do you have poopy butt in your pants right  there?  Because I'm a nigga.  Okay, well, poopy butt does not...  I want to see the goods in the package, but if they're buying, you've got to show what you're 
[03:36:30]  selling, sweetheart.  What kind of makeover does DJ Who Kid?  I'm an MWM, man.  Okay, he needs to look like he's his age and not 12.  He's trying to talk like a 12-year-old.  Who Kid?  You're not 12 years old.  Well, look at his outfit.  He looks like...  Throw the fuck up, Who Kid.  You're like an MTV little, like a...  Oh, I DJ with a 50s saying I ain't Eminem.  What do you want to do with all his 50s?  How old are you?  I'm 40.  40?  40?  He looks like he's 17.  Come on.  He does.  He looks like he's going to get out of high school.  That's why I be getting bitches.  That's good, though.  You look like I'm old.  Don't you want to look 17 when you're 40?  Look at my hat. 
[03:37:00]  No, you don't want to look...  No, because he wants money, so he's going after a millionaire.  We're talking about a millionaire, so if you want to get a millionaire, you've got to show  the game, baby.  It ain't no different.  Look at me here.  This is me and Meryl Streep.  Now, how do I look?  Oh, my God.  You look cute there.  You see?  Well, what's your...  Were you a seat filler there?  So don't sleep on my dick right now.  You were in a tuxedo in that photo.  Yeah.  When you were playing your character.  I know when I'm around certain people how to dress.  Wait, wait.  What was he playing?  What movie?  No, it's not a movie.  No, I DJed Meryl Streep's party.  A character.  Oh, you're a DJ.  A Trippiano.  Yeah. 
[03:37:30]  That's why.  I dress that I do.  Did you go to L.A. and DJ there, too, or Vegas?  No, I just did the Trippiano party for her.  Oh, okay.  And then I play niggas in Paris with them.  Because I'm producing a new show.  A new show?  I'm producing right now.  I'm producing like a lot of...  I'm trying to make other people famous.  I want to get off the grid and relax and retire and go on vacation.  And make some of that producer money.  So I'm working with Rodney Jerkins.  That's smart, yeah.  Okay.  He's one of my family's best friends.  See what I'm saying?  My cousin and him are like really close.  And then she came to me.  She's like, they are a show.  What is this show?  Is this a reality show?  Rodney Jerkins, yeah.  One of the networks is looking at this really closely right now. 
[03:38:00]  And he's 16 years old.  He wrote to Patti LaBelle and said, I have a song for you and I can produce you.  It's 16.  And she hired him and that set the grid.  He's done Bieber, Madonna, Ashley.  He's doing Miley Cyrus' new album.  Yep, exactly.  He's done every single person this year.  So when L.A. Reid was being considered for X Factor, he was being looked at.  He wasn't sure about it.  But he's going to make his wife famous who won Star Search.  Michael Jackson introduced them.  Star Search. 
[03:38:30]  I haven't seen that in a while.  She was a famous singer, backup singer back in the day.  She got pregnant.  She got married, the whole thing.  And then she's like, okay, you make everyone famous but me.  And her voice is amazing.  It's hot.  It is amazing.  Money note, money note, money note.  Is she a little older, though?  No, they're like in their 30s.  Yeah, they're in their 30s.  They were together when she was really young.  Although, I'll tell you this.  We had Superfly Jimmy Snooka in here.  You know who Superfly Jimmy Snooka is.  That's the nigga right there.  He didn't become famous.  How do you say that?  You can only say that when you're black.  Yeah, he's okay. 
[03:39:00]  I'm a nigga.  He has given me.  But is that allowed because we're serious?  Yes.  But if you were on Serrestrial, you couldn't do that, right?  No, no way.  Okay, that's fine.  Oh, hell no.  And only, when I said the Jewish men kind of tend to lie, like on Andy Coney Urino,  that's because I'm Jewish, right?  So you can say it.  So I can say it.  But if you said that I could say it, then I could say it.  But I can't say that until you give me the name.  Okay, got it.  Okay.  And I could say it.  I'm just curious.  He said the N-word, and I was like, whoa, that was twice in 150 minutes.  But he also just saw Django, and he's very into the N-word.  Yeah, I'm niggered out right now.  Oh, my God. 
[03:39:30]  I say fuck more than that.  You never dated a black guy?  Like a rich black guy?  No, but Marcellus, Wiley wanted to go out with me when we were in the show.  You never banged a rich black guy?  No.  I have.  Once you go black.  Once you go black.  Bob Kelly, by the way.  Once you go black, they won't take you back.  Nice to see you.  No, because you know why I asked you.  You know what I mean by that, right?  You know why I asked you.  Well, of course.  Well, it's not even Jewish people.  It's all American boys.  Go on.  Go on.  I didn't mean to cut him off.  I dated somebody like her.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, my God.  Hey, it's radio. 
[03:40:00]  You've got to have energy on radio.  We can't talk like this.  No, but I watch your show.  You'll like that on the show.  Yeah.  You have a lot to say about a lot of people.  The reason is we have 45 minutes.  Our show's four minutes.  We have 45 minutes.  I get every single piece.  And I'm not a housewife.  Hey, what are you doing today?  Are you going to the mall?  Let's just fight about ourselves.  We don't have that on our show.  Our show has a purpose.  We're supposed to clean people up.  I like your show because you have balls because you sit there.  It's hard to viciously insult people just to their faces.  And a girl will walk in and Patty just sits there going, that dress doesn't work at all. 
[03:40:30]  It's terrible.  You look horrible.  Right.  She's looked at women and said, why would you even come in here looking like that?  Like this season, I pull someone's dress off and I basically said, burn it.  And the truth is, is that I am looking through the eyes of men.  If it doesn't have the fuckability factor, as a producer, as well as a matchmaker, you  don't fucking get anywhere.  Right.  That's just life.  You got to have not only.  18 or 80, you still want to swing. 
[03:41:00]  Not only do you have to charm a person, but you can be as charming as you want.  If nobody wants to fuck you, nobody's going to.  Right.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And so my job, you're coming to me to find your future husband.  Well, what are we selling here?  Are we selling your, your resume that you went to Harvard?  Nobody cares.  Let me ask you about, this is another question.  She has ratchets on the show.  I care.  I would care about that.  Bob is about to have a baby.  I would care about a heart for, my wife went to community college.  She's, she's almost dumb.  I would love a heart for graduates.  You know how much money she would make?  Yeah.  But then do you want to fuck her at the end of the day? 
[03:41:30]  I'd fuck you.  Yeah.  Fuck anybody.  In other words, you close your eyes and pretend she's somebody else.  Yeah.  I'll go cheat.  Yeah.  I mean, who kid, for instance, is in a very unhappy marriage?  But you need to lose weight first then.  I know.  But you did too.  Right.  So you want to talk about that?  So I got a product.  I lost weight.  That's why I want to, you lost a lot of weight.  I lost 35 pounds.  You look fabulous.  And it goes faster when you're a man, by the way.  I know, I know.  It's on Censa.  Try Censa.com.  Yeah, but is that the stuff that you just sprinkle?  Yes.  And it works like a charm.  That doesn't make sense.  Okay.  So we have, we have a, no, it is not.  It sounds cancerous.  It's, you know, let me talk.  It looks too easy to be true. 
[03:42:00]  So we have a neurotransmitter in our brain that signals like when we're full.  It's like, it tells all the signals.  And so you do, you do, and you have to smell in order for, to signal it.  So when you're eating something, it doesn't taste like anything.  You're smelling unconsciously.  And then all of a sudden it signals the brain that you're full.  You can eat whatever you want.  And you just sprinkle it on food.  Yeah.  Just a little bit of drop.  Sprinkle.  Just a sprinkle.  Do you have any on you?  No, but I'll get you some.  Okay.  Let me ask you a question.  You lost 35 pounds with this.  Right.  And now after you stopped using it, right? 
[03:42:30]  Or do you have to use it for the rest of your life?  No, you can either keep using it or stop.  You have a choice.  And I stopped because I don't need it anymore.  That's crazy.  It's in my system.  Yeah, you lost a lot of weight.  You look great.  You just know what portions are right for you now?  No, I eat until I'm full.  And I eat what I want.  It's reconditioned your brain?  I'm gluten-free too.  I'm gluten-free too because I get headaches from gluten.  I get really bad, like, paralyzing headaches.  Were you up and down your whole life?  Now you're stable?  I was skinny as a kid.  I gained freshman 15, but probably 20 more in college when I went to University of Miami.  And then I came out, got skinny again. 
[03:43:00]  So, yeah, I was up and down.  Up and down.  Yeah, I was trying to think.  It's that Oprah shit.  That is that Oprah shit.  Bob's on his sixth fat right now.  But I've been three years like this.  Does this count that I've been three years like this?  This is my sixth fat.  Damn.  Well, when I leave, I'm going to get your number and your email and your address and the whole  thing, and I'm going to send you a starter kit.  All right.  And then you're going to talk about it on the air.  All right.  If it works.  You have to sprinkle on everything.  You can't just do it once and the second.  I don't want to sprinkle on that chicken.  Let me tell you, it takes two weeks for it to kick in, and you've got to drink the water.  You've got to drink water.  Liquids.  Because liquids wash it.  You have to do that as a human anyway.  Yeah, but you poop more. 
[03:43:30]  It poops and it eliminates.  You've got to rehydrate.  That's crazy.  Do you sprinkle it on the food?  I thought you'd sprinkle it on yourself.  No, I'm sprinkle on the food.  Pooh kid, that is ridiculous.  It's not cocaine.  Yeah, I mean.  Jesus.  Pooh kid's going to try to sell it.  Not cocaine.  You just snort it.  It is not cocaine.  It is not, not, not cocaine.  Although cocaine, a lot of people lose a lot of weight with cocaine as well.  That is a good option.  Well, that's true, but then they also go Lindsay-fied.  They do.  Oh, my God.  They do.  I mean, like, and they do all these stars in Hollywood tripping down the carpet, you know, and basically  can't, you know, none of them drive. 
[03:44:00]  Like, why don't they have drivers?  Like, I don't understand this.  Like, if you had one DUI and you're rich, get a driver.  Right.  That's it.  Everybody can use Uber.  Yeah.  Has anybody ever heard of Uber?  I have.  I don't know what Uber is.  We're addicted in LA.  It's an app.  It's an app.  It's an app.  And they get car service.  You put your credit card information and it picks you up and drops you off.  And it's nice cars and the most wonderful company in the world.  New York has 666, Carmel.  Right.  666, 666.  Come on.  It's like the devil picking you up.  666.  The worst commercial ever made. 
[03:44:30]  You are totally nuts.  Are you engaged?  I have a promise ring on.  Oh, it's not a full engagement ring?  I'm not ready yet.  Are you dating an Indian?  Why is it a promise ring?  What do you mean?  What does that mean, Bob?  I don't even understand what that means.  I don't know.  Okay.  So we're in a damn economy, right?  Well, there's two reasons why.  One, I'm not ready to get married just yet.  But we've only been living together a few months and we're going out for nine.  Nine months you've been dating.  Yeah.  Second of all, for those who cannot afford an engagement ring, not that he can't, outside 
[03:45:00]  in the real world, okay?  I say you can get the girl a promise ring until you can save up for the diamonds.  Because your diamonds needs to be...  Big.  Okay.  I got to tell you, Bob.  Last one was four carats.  So we have to go up from there.  The thing about an engagement ring is it's the most...  I'm in Hollywood.  It's the most important gift.  That's so small for me.  Bob, you know an engagement ring.  It's the most important gift that you can ever give a woman.  Correct.  You know what I mean?  Other than a baby.  Well, no.  I mean, because every time...  I'll give you that.  Every time that the woman...  You can give anybody that.  Every time that the woman...  That's not special.  ...shows the ring... 
[03:45:30]  Fuck that.  You get credit for it as a man.  Yes, correct.  You know what I mean?  So who do you go to for all your engagement ring needs?  That's funny.  She just said...  Steven Singer.  Do you know about Steven Singer?  No.  Who's Steven Singer?  Well, you'd have to go to IHateStevenSinger.com.  He's the man with engagement rings.  Patty Stanger.  I'm not a great-looking man.  I've got some personality.  Oh, you're married.  I'm married.  You know how I...  Who married you?  That's what I'm saying.  You know how I got it done?  Who?  I went to Steven Singer.  I got a very nice engagement ring from him.  That's the shit right there.  Is it StevenSinger.com? 
[03:46:00]  It's IHateStevenSinger.com.  Why does he have IHateSteven?  Because that way people remember him.  And because guys, they bring their girls to his store.  Where's the store?  It's on the other corner of 8th and Walnut in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  But you can get there at IHateStevenSinger.com.  Guys go in there.  Our girls are now obsessed with it.  And the guys go, I hate Steven Singer.  He's made it so...  Oh, okay.  Affordable.  Okay.  I'll check him out.  I'll check him out.  That's a good...  And you can call him, too, at 1-888-I-HateStevenSinger.  That's the shit right there.  Well, I have a relationship site, Patty Knows.  And it's for... 
[03:46:30]  I don't know if you know...  Do you know She Knows?  It's number five in the top ten, Google being one.  So She Knows is a mommy blogging site.  So they came to me and they said, we want to do a relationship site.  18 or 80, single or married, gay, straight, doesn't matter.  And so, like, when you're...  You fit in there somewhere.  So it's for guys and girls.  So, for instance, let's say two o'clock in the morning, you're pissed off that he didn't  get you the ring.  Right.  And you want to know how to negotiate, you go there.  But if you're a guy and you're not getting any nookie and you want to know how to get  in, you go there, too.  So it's, like, for everybody.  It's everybody's needs.  So it's, like, a one-stop shopping resource. 
[03:47:00]  You've got so much going on.  Well, no, I wanted a site to go to to get, like, info, and there wasn't anything, to  be honest with you.  Do you think, because my wife, she's got friends who wrote a relationship advice book.  Which one?  It's, uh, the gaggle.  Never heard of it.  It's new.  Okay.  It's new, but it's, uh...  Damn, the gaggle.  Like, she worries that now these chicks are not...  This guy makes me...  That they're not going to be able...  Yeah.  Not gag, gaggle.  Oh, okay.  That they're not going to be able to get in relationships themselves because they're in this mind 
[03:47:30]  frame of being analytical about relationships.  Is that what happened to you?  No.  Do you become so obsessed with...  No.  What happened was, is I couldn't...  I was striking out, but I realized, like, on this season of Millionaire Matchmaker, I  had to figure out why am I single at such an older age, and it was like, I had an abandonment  issue.  I was adopted, and it was blocking everything.  Oh, wow.  So we looked for my biological parents, and we have Pamela Slayton, who wrote the book  In Search Of, and she's on OWN.  She basically came to me and said, I can find them for you.  So we find my mother.  We're still working on my dad.  But what I realized was, everyone has a block. 
[03:48:00]  So it's not like you're analytical.  It's like you are using that analytical as a scapegoat to the block.  What's your block?  I see.  When you find out the why, as my boyfriend says, for anything in life, why?  What's your why?  When you find out the why, you cure it, you treat it, and then you move on.  And so that's what's going on in America.  Yes, we're analyzing.  We have our wish list, but we always had our wish list.  The difference is that the stakes are higher, and we're more disposable.  You can throw them away in two seconds.  What did your boyfriend do?  What did your boyfriend do?  Mortgage banking.  Mortgage banking.  So is he a lower, he's a low-key guy. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, he's a sports guy.  He's gym room, peters and money kind of freak.  But he makes a lot of cash, right?  He makes okay.  He's not like me.  I'm way wealthier.  You're a drama mom or the relationship.  What?  No, he can be drama.  Yeah, but he's not into fame or he doesn't like any of this stuff.  But he actually, he went on the carpet, and he had a fantastic time, and he went on, you  watched me date on the show.  I meet him online on Plenty of Fish, and he didn't know who I was until the third date.  So he is very, I think he's going to take to the water pretty well. 
[03:49:00]  Like, I mean, I think he'll be somebody we bring back, and we might have a spinoff.  We're talking to Bravo right now.  Oh, you're on like, this is our life couple show.  Well, I've never done the docu, and I want to be able to go to lunch and go shopping.  Don't do a spinoff.  I want to do the docu.  I want to do like a housewife thing.  I want to, I'm bored with like sometimes just doing my thing.  Don't make him famous.  Don't make him famous.  Why?  Because let him just be the square.  We have good steps.  We don't have to worry about that.  Just be the square.  I like the square.  Would you put that on television? 
[03:49:30]  Would you put that on film?  I would watch.  If I got really in shape, like he's training me.  He used to be a trainer.  So maybe, maybe, maybe.  I didn't do the Tamra where you get in the bathtub thing where she looked naked.  I don't think they were naked, but she looked like it.  So I don't know if I, I'm not that, I'm not that glamorous like her.  So it'd have to look really good.  And, and I mean, you know, if Bravo gave me extra lighting, like porn lighting, that  was better than I would do it.  Like the really good lighting, you know, where everything looks, ah.  I think that's called less lighting.  I'm saying, I mean, you know what I mean? 
[03:50:00]  I mean, if Rachel Zoe and Lisa Vanderpump had a lighting baby, that's what I need.  That's the lighting I need.  Millionaire Matchmaker is on Bravo on Thursday nights.  And Thursday nights, we're going to move in three weeks from Thursdays to Tuesdays.  Why?  Because American Idol's coming out.  So it's really good to shoot.  Okay.  That makes sense.  It's smart.  I'm not going against Seacrest.  He's my, you know, I love my Seacrest.  I won't go up against him.  It's not going to happen.  But one of the things we do have this season is Denise Richards fixing up her father.  What?  We have our first gay millionaires. 
[03:50:30]  What?  Lesbian millionaires?  Do you know who my favorite girls are out of all the girls in the universe?  Lesbians.  The African-American women.  They never give me attitude.  They listen to me.  No, straight women.  They listen to me.  I would say brown-nosing, but that would be...  They don't bitch me out, and they take my advice, and they get married.  Yeah.  It's harder for them.  They're not hood rats, then.  The white boys want...  The white boys are pretty much the only ones that want the A-ers.  The A-girls, their own team doesn't want them.  Who's the most difficult people to deal with?  Is it gay men?  And they seem very dramatic. 
[03:51:00]  No, the gay...  The straight millionaires.  Straight women.  Straight millionaires.  Rich women.  But what ethnicity?  They're the worst...  Because you love the black ones.  Oh, out of the ethnicity...  Yeah.  Back to the Indian chicks?  Jewish.  Jewish women.  You.  And if I say...  You.  Now, that sign back is going to go viral, and I'm going to be like, she hates Jewish women.  No.  Do you hate Jewish women?  No.  They're just...  They're pains in the asses, and the Italians are second.  Yeah.  The Italians are second.  Yeah, because they've...  They're complaining.  Yeah.  And they yenta, and I'm like, I have to work to do. 
[03:51:30]  I got to get off the phone.  Like, just...  Wow.  If the guy doesn't like you, you don't like them next.  You don't go, nin, nin, nin, nin, nin, nin, nin.  It's like, enough already.  Do you find...  You put rules on all your relationships, and you're telling people...  Don't you find that some people just don't apply to these rules?  Yes.  Most people don't listen to...  Like, I have it in a book.  It's called The Bible, basically.  It's Become Your Own Matchmaker on Amazon.  Have you named your book The Bible?  No, it's The Bible.  It's called Become...  Really?  It's called Become Your Own...  Yeah, God's going to be mad at that.  It's called Become Your Own Matchmaker.  You can get it on Amazon, and I also have a DVD, How to Get Married in a Year. 
[03:52:00]  Now, do you instruct people on how to become a matchmaker, but they can go so far?  Like, there are a couple of spices that you don't put in there because...  It's spicy.  Because you don't want them taking your day.  Well, my consulting stuff is, like, for the billionaire level, yeah, where I go move in with you,  and I straighten out your life.  How did you decide that, I'm going to set up millionaires?  Like, how did you skip over, like, no poor folk?  Well, I worked with the poor folk.  I had great expectations for eight years, and I ran the company.  So I worked with them, and I wanted to work with Rich, who basically could pay me.  Like, once the money's out of the way, let's start the work. 
[03:52:30]  You know, poor folk want to give you payment plans.  They want to cut him and hog out the money.  I didn't want to complain about the money and spend a lot of time doing it.  This is what I wanted to ask you.  That reminded me.  What about that blonde that used to work for you, that used to be on the show,  and then she started popping up on TMZ and saying nasty things about you,  and now she's disappeared?  Fucking bitch.  My oldest assistant?  Yeah, what was her story?  Oh, Chelsea?  I fixed her up with her boyfriend, and he was a drug dealer, which we didn't know at the time,  and he basically taught her to do her own company.  So she tried to, you know, rip me off. 
[03:53:00]  I took care of her for, like, almost eight, like, seven, no, almost eight years I took care of her.  Do you think the drug dealer was a bad influence on her?  Yeah, he really was.  I mean, like, we didn't know that he was, like, dropping off, you know, money for weed  and doing shit like that.  Was he a black guy or a white guy?  No, white guy.  He actually had no, he lived in a boat, he had no place to live, he had no car,  but we didn't know, he had asked me at first, and he presented himself well.  I didn't do any screening on him, so I said, here, why don't you go out with my assistant instead?  But he was just trying to get that money.  Well, he wanted to, he wanted to start a company like mine, and so he used her. 
[03:53:30]  I don't know if they're still together, I don't talk to her, I don't know.  Does the company exist?  I don't know, I really don't, I don't pay attention.  Like, usually when someone screws me over, I go next.  I don't dwell on shit like that.  Does he not realize that you had a TV show connected with your company?  Yes, I was on the air already, yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, you have to understand something.  What happens is people in Hollywood get a taste of fame and greed, and they just don't  make wise choices.  Like, you have to look at the end game.  What's important?  Love is the most important thing in your life.  No, it's not.  I was about to say, hey, she said it. 
[03:54:00]  Love is the most important thing, it's not money.  Money helps.  Money makes you comfortable, but at the end of the day, you could have a lot of money  and be really alone.  That's true.  I got a question, though.  That's true.  Yeah.  I got a question, though.  You deal with a lot of millionaires, and then I used to date a millionaire, and well.  You dated a millionaire?  Temporarily.  Millionaire is.  But the only reason, yeah, the only reason I dated her, because she had people investigate  my bank account.  Is that normal?  Yes.  What?  Okay, yeah, that's what?  Well, we just came off of one of the other radio shows, and one of the young girls is single 
[03:54:30]  and said, I will date somebody who has good credit.  Well, how do you find out if the person has good credit?  What about your soul?  Why do you need that love?  Why do you need that love?  What about love?  Because you basically will end up paying for that.  And money, if you have bad financial philosophy, okay, and you don't have no hands on your finance  as well, it'll kill the relationship.  Money first and sex second.  I want to tell you something.  I want to tell you who it is, though.  I want to know.  Wait a minute.  Stop.  Stop.  I want to ask where the love is.  You know, who is it?  Who is it?  Money is what?  Who is it?  I mean, you think I'm this nigga here. 
[03:55:00]  He's just chilling and shit.  You know what I'm saying?  Who is it?  She's the owner of Jimmy Choo, Tamara Mullen.  Really?  She goes black, really?  She got this big black dick.  You know what I'm saying?  She's one of my favorite people in the whole world.  She's on Million Dollar Decorators.  She's the, well, I do.  I live in her shoes.  Like, she is my shoe god.  Damn, you're like having an orgasm.  Yeah, I'm like, when her house, Lawrence Ballard did her house, like, years ago in London,  and I fell in love with him then.  Yeah.  And she's like, you know, he's on Million Dollar Decorators.  She was just on.  She's beautiful.  She actually just had her baby, which was like eight months. 
[03:55:30]  With Carnegie?  Yeah, she broke up with the loser from-  Carnegie, yeah.  Yeah, the dude that did all the-  Andrew Carnegie's great, great.  I got to say goodbye to Patty Stanger.  Yeah.  She got to move on to the next spot.  Was she in rehab then?  Was she out of rehab?  She was just out of the truth.  She was a user.  Yeah, she was a user.  And then they checked my bank account and she gave me sex.  But before Patty Stanger leaves-  How long did you go out with her for?  Three months.  Why'd you tell me this at the top of the hour?  Because you thought I was just niggas.  This was the good stuff.  I want you to know that in case you feel like you've upset the Jews with your comments- 
[03:56:00]  No, I love my Jewish people.  Justin Stangle, the head writer, executive producer for David Letterman-  What'd he say?  He says, tell her I say hi.  Joe, you lit.  Justin Stangle says hi.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Then you tell him, I've never done Letterman.  I want to go on.  Okay, you heard it, Stangle.  No, I want to watch you text that.  I'll talk while you text.  I'll text him right now.  Okay, he's listening to you.  It's my show now.  He's listening to you right now.  Seriously, I totally-  Do you understand?  Okay, so Justin, listen to me.  When I was in college at University of Miami, David Letterman was my crush.  That's no joke.  Get the hell out of here.  I saw him twice.  Are you serious?  I saw him twice in his freezing studio in New York City. 
[03:56:30]  My dad did jewelry for one of the radio DJs years ago, and they gave me that as my sweet  16th birthday present.  And yes, he is my god.  I love the way he flirts.  I don't care that he had a fair.  Who cares?  So did Clinton.  Who gives a shit?  But anyway, the bottom line is, I love him.  And I know NBC and CBS have that stupid war, but I will do anything to come on because  he's my god.  All right.  He's the comedy god.  He's the-  There's-  Who, Justin Stengel?  No.  David Letterman over Leno. 
[03:57:00]  Wow.  And then I love Kimmel, too.  I love Kimmel, too.  But, you know, Leno-  She comes in third place.  What he's doing right now, and I agree with Kimmel on the philosophy of comedy, you know,  like, you have to exit grace-  You have to exit gracefully, and you can't take it back.  You can't take your retirement back.  Right.  You just can't.  Once you're retired, you're retired.  You've got to make a decision.  You know, this is not Barbara Streisand in my last tour.  Spencer's panicking.  She keeps doing over and over again.  We're making you late for your other interview.  We're making you late.  I gotta go.  I gotta go.  But I'm not-  But they're not gonna be as good as this one.  Take care.  The other interview.  You're good, man.  Oh, no, no, no.  Because you guys have it. 
[03:57:30]  You have the edge.  They'll be good.  Can I be honest with you?  The fuck they're best.  I was like, I have to do serious this morning, really?  Did we make your day?  No, I had a show on Pink for a year, and I was just like, I'm so tired.  Can we, like, put it in February?  Like, please.  But, like, my PR person's standing there, and she's like, oh, she didn't want to go.  I had the best time today.  I'm having the best time.  This show specifically.  I miss radio.  I miss radio.  Not the other shows as much.  I love this.  You're my favorite.  But don't tell everybody else.  Don't tell Rich and Covina, because, you know.  They're not that great.  They're better.  But they're really hot.  Yeah, I mean, but, yeah, they're on the radio.  I mean, he's your hot factor, right? 
[03:58:00]  I guess, but he looks like he's 17.  I'm the N-word of the show, baby.  Yeah, but he's the hot factor.  I'm the hot factor.  Look, he hit Tomorrow Mellon.  Man, he must have a lot of junk in that trunk, baby.  She had a fur coat with her boots.  That's it.  He's got a big package for them to do it.  I've heard it's huge.  Okay.  We banged at the meter.  Thank you, Patty.  I'm making a proposal.  Next season, I do millionaires in training.  Yeah.  Let's put them on.  Can I go on, too?  Yes, you can be there.  Will you be the judge?  Will you be, like, the judge in the recruiting session?  Yes, I will.  You'll help me pick out women for him?  Yeah.  And then if he loses the weight on Sensa, I'll bring you both on. 
[03:58:30]  Oh, my God, Patty.  You've got to come back.  I'm making an offer.  I'm married.  I'm good.  Justin, 310.  I married a thousandaire.  Justin, my email is pbstanger at Gmail.  That's my personal email.  Not my Millionaire's Club email.  pbstanger at Gmail.  I'm going to email her, too, Justin.  Okay, bye.  Bye, Justin.  Bye, love you guys.  Take care.  Bye, Patty.  Who can't have Patty?  Is this mic on?  Yeah, it's on.  You sure?  You can tell, could you?  There's a lot of people talking.  Can you tell her that I'm in love with her and that she can call me anytime? 
[03:59:00]  You love her or she?  What's up, Sambo?  How are you?  She's gorgeous.  Dude, did I tell you that I'm...  She's gorgeous.  This month, I'm all in New York, all month.  Why is that?  Okay.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Ryan, do you favor?  I have to get his information.  I'll get for Santa.  For Santa.  Thank you, Spencer.  Jim Norton.  My name is Jim Norton.  I'll be sleeping on this dick, man.  She's got dicks everywhere.  First of all, it's like the U-N of dicks.  Come on, Jenga.  Jenga, whatever.  Eric, that counted as my live read, right? 
[03:59:30]  Yeah, but you should also do the other one.  My God.  You know what you got?  You know what you have?  You have patience.  That's what you...  You have a big dick.  I know that because you have such patience.  I have a small dick.  And you don't have no patience for that, right?  I wanted to go shut your face nine million times.  And because it's not my show...  Anthony.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Is that you?  Bob is crazy.  Does that fucking bitch ever shut up?  Oh, God.  Anthony.  Fuck.  Anthony, I am... 
[04:00:00]  You're a self-promoting fuck machine.  Anthony, I...  Do you understand?  I am fucking furious right now.  Why?  I wanted to say shut the fuck up 9,000 times.  But you didn't see me laughing when you were pointing at a couple of hints and I was laughing  on the side.  Oh, God.  You know how many other drivers on the road right now have to pay for my anger?  I was listening to that fucking segment with her.  Blahdy, blahdy, blah.  And then, God forbid, you told her Justin Stengel was listening. 
[04:00:30]  She fucking forgot about you in a second.  That's all she could concentrate on was Justin Stengel.  And, oh, yeah, I'm sure we'll be seeing her on Letterman sometime.  Yeah.  You know what?  I didn't tell her.  You know how Justin Stengel responded to the text?  He responded, I'm sure she does.  The same way if I asked to be on.  I'm sure he does.  I'm sure he does.  You know, oh, I'm sure she's fucking, you know, what millionaires does she take?  The ones that look like fucking models?  It's me.  I'm a millionaire and I like fucking. 
[04:01:00]  It's about love, Anthony, not fucking.  I promise.  And let me tell you something.  I've had money and I haven't had money.  Relationships are fuckload easier when you got money.  Believe me.  Believe that.  Believe that.  That's why I got this hat on, nigga.  Because you're not arguing about other shit.  You argue about, you know, real shit.  Like, well, why do you have a second phone?  Whose number is this?  Why are you following that girl on Twitter?  You told me you were 17.  Oh, shit. 
[04:01:30]  Is that back to the...  Like, where's the fucking electric bill?  Is that back to the paranoia?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Paranoia.  That bitch was paranoid.  I guarantee there's people that were listening that killed themselves.  Literally rode.  Just didn't think she did that bad.  Oh.  She got nervous with the N-word.  You saw when I said it?  She was like, oh, my God.  We all did.  Jesus.  We all did.  I thought everybody was comfy.  You got very annoying.  That's your review, Anthony.  Yes.  Extremely fucking annoying.  That nonstop yapping. 
[04:02:00]  That yapping.  It's not like Anthony was regurgitating.  Like, his breakfast is something.  Oh, man.  One thing I got to tell you.  Fucking who, kid.  Throw in little words.  And when she goes something, she said something about water.  And you just hear who, who could go, oh, moisture.  That was killing me.  I'm trying to, you know, spice it up.  Right.  He was making me laugh.  He just threw a new girl.  Every once in a while, just new girl.  Who gives that spice?  But look how she melted when I fucked the Jimmy Choo chick. 
[04:02:30]  Like, she fucking had an orgasm.  Oh, that makes me suck.  Look, you got ten minutes to redeem yourself, motherfucker.  That sucks.  All right.  Thank you, Anthony.  I didn't realize Bobby was so mad.  But afterwards, she says, yeah, I want you on my show.  He's like, no, no, that's all right.  You wouldn't do her show?  No.  I was, no, I don't watch it.  I don't like people who don't shut the fuck up.  You gotta shut the fuck up.  Shut the fuck up.  Look, I'm a yapper.  Everybody's a yapper. 
[04:03:00]  But we know when to shut the fuck up and just let somebody say something.  Right.  We tried to.  I'm not going to.  It's not my show.  God bless her.  The show.  My wife loves the show.  It's a great show.  Blah, blah, blah.  I love her show.  And your guest, I'm not going to fucking fuck with that.  She cut Sam off.  Like, you know, she cut you off like six times.  Many times.

Saturday, I got Nicki Minaj.  You have Nicki Minaj up here. 
[04:05:00]  I'm not up here.  She's calling from whatever bullshit she's at.  She's got skinny.  Have you seen her?  Huh?  Dumb bitch.  Well, I didn't say that, did I?  I think so.  Damn, my nigga.  She used to do your show.  You know, Nicki Minaj used to come up here.  And this was when she was all sexual like Lil' Kim.  Yeah.  And she had just a regular like.  Big mouth, too.  Like street.  She just had a weave.  Not like a big pink wig, but just like a black chick weave.  And she would come up here and she would do Who Kid's show.  All of a sudden, she comes out with a pop album.  She's gone.  She's gone, right?  She became white.  She's white now.  That's called being famous.

Bob, me and you.  Yeah.  If Raw Dog doesn't do the right thing with me, they're fucking out of their minds.  Am I right?  I think that if you don't get that show, and I've thought about this a lot, you're perfect  because if you get somebody comic to do it, if another opportunity comes up, they're gone.  Yeah.  This is what you want to do.  And I'm not going anywhere.  Let's be honest.  I don't have any talents.  No, you have talents. 
[04:06:30]  You know what your talent is?  What?  Running your own show.  That's right.  On Raw Dog.  Broadcasting.  How, indeed, moisture.  They're going to give it to the comic.  You're fucked.
