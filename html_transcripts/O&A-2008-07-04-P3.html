<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a phone interview with comedian Bob Kelly, calling live from a Boston Fox 25 news studio.  Kelly discussed his upcoming shows, a bizarre DVD about the making of an audio CD, and humorous anecdotes from his appearances on CNN and Spike TV, including a physical altercation on live TV with Jay Davis and Gene LeVanchi where they slapped each other. He recounted how many jokes, including a Michael Jackson one, were cut from his Britney Spears-focused CNN segment.  The conversation then took a decidedly vulgar turn as Kelly shared increasingly absurd and offensive details about a recent snuba diving experience, punctuated by numerous caller interruptions and the hosts’ own commentary.  This segment was rife with offensive language and sexually explicit humor.

The show then shifted to a recap of their "O&A Traveling Virus" comedy tour, specifically the Worcester, MA show.  They detailed overwhelmingly positive audience response, despite logistical nightmares. The hosts, along with their brother (present in-studio), and Jimmy Norton (also in-studio) recounted a chaotic road trip with staff and fans, describing them collectively as "jackasses."  Specific incidents included treating hundreds of listeners to a chaotic IHOP breakfast; clashes with the DCU Center venue staff over merchandise sales and one host’s "rape"-themed t-shirt; the accidental damage to their van (featuring their faces and sponsors) caused by their brother while driving under the influence with a drunken passenger, Danny; a bar incident where their brother’s money was stolen; and the filming of a backstage video with Jim Norton (featuring full nudity) to address a production problem.  Listener calls from those who attended the Worcester show added further humorous and offensive anecdotes.

Next, the hosts launched into a scathing critique of Whoopi Goldberg’s new radio show, "Wake Up With Whoopi," calling it "terrible" and playing audio clips to highlight their points –  the perceived awkwardness, poor chemistry between Goldberg and Cubby Bryant, and overly polite format.  They detailed how their listeners ("pests") successfully infiltrated Whoopi’s show’s phone lines causing chaos.  Other topics briefly touched upon included a previous comedy show, a Tracy Morgan story, and problems with a video on their website showing Jimmy Norton’s buttocks.  This segment included vulgar language and sexually themed jokes, with a call from "Stalker Patty."

This critique of Whoopi Goldberg continued, focusing on her perceived politeness and refusal to address the Mel Gibson DUI. The hosts contrasted her style with their own “vicious” approach, referencing public interest in sensational news, and again highlighted their "Pests" and a recent prank call invasion of Whoopi’s show, referencing New York Daily News articles.  They discussed the fallout, including calls from Clear Channel executives attempting (unsuccessfully) to get them in trouble, and Whoopi’s attempt to involve Howard Stern.  Unexpectedly, Whoopi Goldberg herself appeared in the studio.  The ensuing conversation involved humorous banter, mutual jabs, apologies from both sides (Whoopi for a comment and O&A for calling her a "bitch"), and the hosts expressing regret at potentially losing a “good enemy.”

The broadcast concluded with a disturbing segment featuring a remote caller, Mike, who was visibly intoxicated and repeatedly displayed firearms on camera, even chambering a round in his AR-15.  Mike repeatedly asked for approval to shoot holes in his wall, referencing a prior incident.  He displayed multiple guns, including a .45 caliber handgun, causing significant alarm from the hosts who expressed unease and concern.  Mike’s erratic behavior, the hosts’ reactions, and brief interjections of other stories, including a news report about a 911 call made with toes, filled this segment until Mike eventually hung up.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It was awful, worthless, they're the worst, just screaming every racial epithet you can think of, an abomination, it's the worst of the L.P. and Anthony Show.  Hey, Bob.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  L.P., Anthony, what's up?  What's up, Bob?  Nothing, man, I'm just hanging out, ready to go on Fox 25.  Fox 25, you're up in Boston.  Fox 25 News, Robert Kelly from Torgasm's here. 
[00:00:30]  Can you keep your phone on?  I will, and you want me to keep it on?  I'll keep it on the whole time.  That's not a bad idea, actually.  Remember the stupid things we used to have to do for that?  Coming up at 8 p.m., sliders on Fox 25.  Me and Opie used to have to do little commercials.  It was awful.  Yeah.  Have you done any shows yet?  Or no, did you start in Rhode Island last night?  I did it last night in Rhode Island, yeah.  Rhode Island was actually pretty good.  It's actually an old bank.  You want to get a review from your Rhode Island show?  Yeah, sure. 
[00:01:00]  All right, let's say hi to Ken in New York.  Ken, what's up?  Hey, man, I just want to tell you guys that Robert Kelly killed last night in Rhode Island.  Great show.  He usually does.  Thank you, buddy.  He does very well on stage.  As a human being, you're garbage.  But, I mean, on stage, you do get it done.  Thank you, Jim.  I appreciate that.  What are you taping your CDs, sweet potato?  We're doing it Friday and Saturday night at Samuel Hall.  Oh, actually, in Boston.  Actually, I'm doing a videotape.  I'm doing a DVD of the making of an audio CD. 
[00:01:30]  That's pretty cool.  Jesus.  Yeah, I know.  I had to sit with this idiot and discuss his career on a park bench.  I had to sit there and talk to him, like, seriously about it and, you know, about the perils of making a CD and what you have to get done.  Did you have to really decide whether you wanted to do a DVD of the making of a CD or a CD on the making of a DVD?  I had to do the latter.  No, the forward.  The former.  You asked.  You had two options. 
[00:02:00]  We're going in right now.  We're going in right now.  You're going in right now for the interview?  Yeah.  All right.  Hi, how you doing?  Just keep the phone.  All right.  I'm on the radio right now, so I just got to talk to these guys.  Open Anthony.  You know Open Anthony?  Oh, yes.  You do?  The mayor loves them.  The mayor loves them.  Yes.  Well, you do know Open Anthony.  Are you friends with the mayor?  Wow, you're pretty cute.  How you doing?  She laughs at everything I say, too.  I like her.  That's good.  What are they bringing into the studio?  Oh, they're live right now.  I was yapping. 
[00:02:30]  Good.  Yap some more.  What else are they doing?  Just keep the phone on, Bob.  Keep the phone on.  Who is it?  Sean who?  Mullen.  Sean Mullen is on.  Oh.  Who's Sean Mullen?  Powerhouse.  He said that he's a powerhouse.  Hey, Bob, you want a good line?  Say this.  Say you're doing the – shut that hole up.  I'm talking.  Tell her you're doing a – you're doing the connection tonight.  Your middle act is John Carr.  Who?  John Carr.  John Carr.  He's like a local dude up there. 
[00:03:00]  He's an old comic who actually never made it.  Yeah.  John Carr is my middle act.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just say that.  Why don't you say something over-the-top racist, and then they'll talk about you all day on  the news, and then you're going to sell a ton of tickets.  Yeah.  See, John Carr is being flown in from Thailand to be your middle act.  What are you setting me up for?  Actually, nothing.  It's a joke about a comic up there who got busted for porn in Thailand, John Carr, as  a guy who killed John Bonet. 
[00:03:30]  Why do you have to spoil everything?  Yeah, just go with it.  Let's see what they – yeah.  All right.  Let's see what they do with that.  John Carr.  Are they sitting you down?  No.  They're walking me.  Where am I going?  Interview set.  I'm going to interview set.  We're at the back door.  This is actually a pretty nice studio.  It's a very big studio.  What's your name, sweetie?  Seth.  Really?  Sweetie.  Like men?  I love men.  Okay.  She does laugh at everything.  She's great.  I hate you there, Anthony.  Yeah.  Bob, just grab her and bite her. 
[00:04:00]  By the way, Calhoun or whatever is a city.  It's not a city.  It's a restaurant.  Oh, okay.  In Saugus.  It's in Saugus, Mass.  That comedy connection for tonight's show with Bob Kelly.  Oh, that's why.  All right.  He's singing a song right now.  Is he?  I want to throw my phone off the balcony.  Are you almost there?  I'm out of breath.  I'm going to pass up.  Is there an elevator in this?  An escalator?  Did you see my gut?  Is he walking upstairs?  I had to walk up. 
[00:04:30]  She's laughing at that, too.  She just called me fat, basically.  Thanks, honey.  Am I sitting here?  Yes.  Is this who my interview is in the hallway?  You're going to be over there.  But I think you don't want to be on the lights.  It's too hot.  It's too hot.  You don't want me in the lights?  No, it's too hot.  Oh, boy.  They're interviewing you in a hallway?  Yeah.  Man, you've really made it, Bob.  Wow.  Stand next to the water fountain.  The cameras are on.  I'm sure they interviewed Dane Cook in the hallway, too.  Yeah, I know.  He gets the full makeup, the professional lighting. 
[00:05:00]  I don't need makeup.  All right.  Are you going on soon?  Because we've got to take a break.  I guess so.  They have this guy singing right now.  Do you want to hear him sing?  Yeah.  Oh, it's awful.  Hang on.  Who is this guy?  Sean Mullen.  Oh, he's a one-hit wonder.  Lullaby, I think, was his big hit, right?  How was it?  Oh, God.  What the hell is this?  It looks like Jack Black and Stone Cold Steve Austin is singing. 
[00:05:30]  He's trying to make a comeback.  Oh, my God.  Hey, we got the video up thanks to Pal Talk.  One of our Boston listeners got the show you're going to be on on Pal Talk right now.  They're probably going to go to commercial before they do you, no, Bob?  All right.  Do you want me to say anything?  Yeah, they're going to go to commercial.  Do you want me to say anything on the show?  John Carr is your middle act.  Do you really want me to say that?  More than I want to take my next breath.  Please.  All right.  All right. 
[00:06:00]  Are we live on this?  Is it live?  It's live.  Okay.  Of course it is.  When are you going on?  Who's got the camera up?  It's actually one of those electronic cameras, Anthony, which you'd love.  Okay.  Actually, it's remote-controlled.  No, no, no.  We're talking about the Pal Talk cameras here.  Can somebody tape that for us, too, in case we miss the audio and commercial?  Do you want to plug the virus show in Camden, too?  I'll pop that in.  It won't help because it's Boston.  It's Boston.  I thought there might be a couple people that would make the trip. 
[00:06:30]  Good.  They're going to have to go to commercial, I'm thinking.  That guy does look like Jack Black.  Yeah, they're going to have to go.  All right.  We'll take a break, and we'll just keep your phone on, Bob.  Yeah, sure.  All right.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  It's the worst of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Bob Kelly.  Yo, what's up, man?  Hi there, Bobby.  We had to talk to Fat Boy Slim, so we missed you.  Well, we tried to listen in to your interview, but it was really hard to hear.  Dude, he had no idea.  I was like, yeah, it's me, Jay Davis, John Carr's real funny comic. 
[00:07:00]  He's little him.  I said it twice.  He had no idea.  Oh, wow.  We've got to get the audio.  What an ass.  John Carr.  That ghoul.  That son of a bitch slapped me in the face.  And then, what's his name?  Gene LeVanchi?  Who slapped you?  Well, Jay Davis came over.  He was off to the side.  I was doing the interview.  So I called him over, and I was like, yeah, we fought a little bit on the show,  but we're doing the show together.  We're friends now, and I kind of apologized to him. 
[00:07:30]  And Jay just cracked me in the face.  Jesus.  So then Gene LeVanchi slaps me in the face.  And then I wound up cracking Gene LeVanchi in the face.  Yeah, we heard some kind of a ruckus going on.  But Gene LeVanchi, I mean, I'm not even kidding.  He didn't even hold back.  He just smashed me in the face, and he's the size of a lineman on a hockey team.  Why did he slap you besides just a desire people have when they see that face? 
[00:08:00]  Bob, your face was built to be slapped.  Yeah.  Oh, thanks, Jim.  I appreciate it.  We have the same face, mushy chin.  But then he saw Jay slap me.  He goes, you want to slap me back?  So I was like, yeah, I do.  Take your glasses off.  This was all on live TV?  Live TV.  And then I just, I'm not even kidding you, I didn't even hold back.  I cracked that son of a bitch across his cheek.  I thought he was going to hit me.  I got to see that. 
[00:08:30]  Why did he slap you?  I don't know, because Jay slapped me.  And then I, Jay came back in the face.  I slapped him to get him back.  And then he goes, I go, you want to slap me?  He goes, yeah, sure.  And I didn't think he was going to do it.  I thought he was just kidding, because he's Gene LeVanchi.  And then he just cracked me across the face.  We got to get the video.  Oh, it's, it's, I don't even know what happened.  I feel like I just got into a fight.  Yeah.  Was it friendly, though?  I was, dude, everybody was laughing.  I slapped Gene LeVanchi in the face. 
[00:09:00]  Who's Gene LeVanchi?  Dude, he's a, he's like a hometown, uh, he used to do sports for, you know,  forever.  Yeah.  I grew up with the guy.  He's been up there forever.  So, you know, I kept saying John Carr, and I said, I think I said it two or three times,  and he had no idea.  He's like, that's good.  Good for you.  That's great.  That sounds fun.  Oh, can we get that?  All right, we're going to have it in a few minutes.  Hey, Bob, you also were on CNN recently.  Yeah.  You're blowing up, buddy.  Why were you on CNN?  I was on Spike TV, too, last night. 
[00:09:30]  Like I said, you were on CNN recently.  No, you know what I'll tell you, Spike TV, that son of a bitch, can I, I'm just kidding,  are you friendly with that guy?  Who?  What's his name?  Sharipa.  I don't know.  Steve Sharipa?  Yeah.  No, he blew us off.  Dude, let me tell you something.  I'm going to tell you something, this guy.  This guy, I go on, right?  I'm on the show.  He literally tells me right off the bat he hates comedians.  That's good.  I'm like, oh, that's good.  I go, yeah, because he used to book the club, the Riviera. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  I go, oh, you club owners, you guys are really happy together, though.  No, you guys don't have any problems at all.  And then he, actually, whatever, we're fucking busting balls, and he keeps saying some gay  shit.  Torgasm's gay.  I'm like, dude, Torgasm's gay?  What about your show, Johnny Cakes?  And I'm trying to bust balls, have fun, and then I start joking around with the other people,  like the, you know, the people in the background, and he goes, listen, all right, save it for  your show later.  Save the funny for your show later. 
[00:10:30]  We got business.  Who said we got business?  He did.  Here's why.  Because when someone is trying to be funny and break balls, hey, get you whacked!  Will ya?  And then a comedian comes with real wit.  They don't have anything really to say.  And that's probably why he was uncomfortable with it, because you were being funnier than  him.  You're lucky he didn't throw a garbage douche.  Yeah, I'll make you look like a bio-managota.  Will ya?  Yeah, and they just kept talking. 
[00:11:00]  They're like, they just kept talking.  Like, they're supposed to ask me shit, but they just kept yapping, and they just kept  reading.  Like, they just wanted to get that.  We're on XM, right?  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on, Bob.  This is all on the air with Sharipa?  Dude, this is all on the air.  And no, the line about, you know, yeah, all right, comic.  You know, save the funny for your show later.  We got business to do.  What business do they have to do?  I don't even know the show.  Dude, it's Spike TV.  It's like dinner and a movie, except it's fucking, you know, like, they have, like, 
[00:11:30]  me, him, Howard Stern's girl, I think it is.  The blonde girl.  Yeah.  And you just sit there, and they're basically supposed to ask you questions.  Wait, when did you tape that show?  Like, two weeks ago.  Okay, never mind.  So...  I wanted to see if she had a cast on, you know.  A what?  Nothing.  Then it's a callback.  Go ahead.  So, yeah, dude, it was atrocious.  Yeah.  I mean, who tells a comic not to be funny?  Yeah, don't be funny.  What do you want to talk about?  The news?  You get the USA Today, you fat bastard. 
[00:12:00]  Right.  Oh, wait, this is all on Spike TV?  This is all on Spike TV.  I'm sorry, Bob.  I was confused.  I think you saw him today.  No, no.  It was on his show.  And I was actually really looking forward to it, because he, you know, I thought he, you  know, he, comics, he knows comics.  He says, I hate comics.  Oh, thanks.  Cool.  Well, he probably dealt with a lot of douchebags, but.  I don't know, but you don't tell me that, you son of a bitch.  All right, Bob.  So, you were on CNN commenting on Britney Spears.  We got the audio.  Oh, God.  Oh, what?  Oh, God. 
[00:12:30]  You didn't like it?  It was, no, it was, they cut out a lot of stuff.  I actually, the line they, they cut out, I did a nice Rich Voss plug into it, and they  cut out a line about Michael Jackson, so they kind of edited it like VH1 to make it more  tame, so.  Ew.  What was the Michael Jackson line?  I said something about, you know, Britney Spears got the past torch from Madonna.  She made out with Britney, and that was kind of passing the torch to Britney, and, you know,  a lot of people do that.  Michael, I said something about Michael Jackson passes the torch, but, you know, he does it 
[00:13:00]  to little kids.  All right.  All right, well, let's listen to the audio.  Of course, it's the Britney Spears stuff.  Another thing that is on YouTube that everyone's checking out, her talking with Kevin, they  look like they're fucked up, either smoking pot or drunk or something, and then they have  all these pot thoughts, and they talked about time travel.  Yeah, she called it time, speed, space travel.  Time, speed, space travel.  What a dope.  So here's Bob Kelly on CNN commenting. 
[00:13:30]  And while some are taking this latest Britney sighting in stride.  It really is not going to hurt her image at all.  Her fans know that Britney Spears is just a pretty, you know, down-to-earth, simple,  low-key girl, and this is exactly what she's doing in the video.  She's hanging out, having some snacks, having fun.  This really isn't going to hurt her career at all.  Others got a look at Britney's whacked-out theories on time travel.  Have you ever seen Back to the Future?  Mm-hmm.  Is that possible to time travel speed?  Mm-hmm.  Yes, it is.  And they're taking their shots at her. 
[00:14:00]  You know, she just went out and bought a DeLorean, too.  She's put a Jack LaLanne juicer on the back of it.  She's sticking cabbage in it right now.  It don't work.  Honey, it don't work.  Dude, dude, you got to put lettuce in.  I've seen them use lettuce, dude.  You sure?  Yeah.  Wow.  Hello.  Wow.  Hello.  Do you know right now, I don't blame anybody who have slapped your face in the last five years. 
[00:14:30]  Whoa.  Right now, John Ramsey is having bigger laughs at the news he just got.  Wow.  They really cut that up.  Yeah.  Yeah, they must have.  They did it out all the good stuff.  They did a humirectomy.  What do you want to do, Lucky Louie on CNN in the afternoon?  Atta boy.  Good plug.  I'll take it.  I actually did a great plug, and they cut it, because they pissed me off.  I did, look, we're talking about Britney today.  We're not talking about the Stones.  All right, here's Has It Hurt Her Reputation. 
[00:15:00]  Bob Kelly on CNN.  Showbiz Tonight is wondering, after months of tabloid coverage of her marriage to Kevin  Federline, her missteps with her baby, and now this clip, are people now laughing with  Britney or at her?  How about music videos?  Can we try that again?  Maybe we'll get back to the old singing routine?  Hit me baby one more time.  Back when Britney was doing the old singing routine, beginning with Hit Me Baby One More  Time, Britney quickly became an iconic superstar. 
[00:15:30]  She sold more than 76 million records worldwide.  I live for Britney Spears.  She did it all, from commercials, to perfume, and even kissing Madonna.  She made out with Madonna.  You know, you have to be big to make out with Madonna, all right?  Not only do you have to be a woman, but you have to be big.  She was the biggest thing for a minute.  I mean, she was it.  She was the next Madonna for a second.  And then, you know.  Wait a minute.  I want to put out an open call to any comedians. 
[00:16:00]  We'd have a vacancy on the O&A Traveling Virus Tour show.  Listen, Jackass, they called me at 10 that morning for a 12-day day.  Where were you?  At a wake?  What do you want me to do?  That was a pretty good line.  Yo, dude.  That's dumb.  That was a pretty good line.  A wake.  Dude.  Where were you?  Britney, dude, she made out with Madonna.  You've got to be big to make out with Madonna.  I mean, not only do you have to be a woman, but you've got to be big. 
[00:16:30]  That was a pretty good line.  But that's the line.  They cut it up, dude.  They had the other line, the Michael Jackson line, but they wouldn't use that.  And then the plug was in that.  It was pretty funny.  What are they trying to do, like a VH1 thing on CNN?  Well, yeah.  Dude, I had no idea.  They called me up.  You want to do CNN?  Of course I do.  What do you think?  They wanted you to talk about the war?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Well, I thought, yeah.  I mean, you know, Hezbollah and Lebanon, I mean, and Israel, there's certain things going  on that I know about that maybe could help the situation. 
[00:17:00]  They got a juicer on the back of their tanks.  I'm telling them, put in lettuce.  She bought a Lamborghini.  It's got a juicer on it.  And then you realize it wasn't going the way you want, so you started naming things she  put in there.  Dude, you got hot peppers.  You got red peppers.  You got green peppers.  You got lettuce.  They put a whole bunch of celery.  Oh, please be a funny vegetable coming up.  Put in Karen and Quinlan.  Sorry, at the end of every sentence, I didn't go, yuck.  Well, maybe you should have.  Maybe you should have slapped the reporter in the face. 
[00:17:30]  I'd like to put my cock all over your Darth Vader cheeks.  All right, Bob, we have one more clip from CNN.  By the way, at The Connection, Bob will be doing the complete version of the Lamborghini  juicer bit.  Oh, and I like to fucking stick my dick in your mini disc recorder.  All right, I'll smash you a foot on the foot thing.  And driving mishaps with her son, Sean Preston, made her a bit of a tabloid joke.  Anything with a baby, you know, it ruined Michael Jackson and it ruined Britney. 
[00:18:00]  Okay, you can't have kids.  And if you do have kids, adopt them, like Brad and Angelina.  But some say, don't count Britney out.  You're going to keep an eye on her.  She's really going to come into her own in the next few years.  She's gone back into the studio right now.  She's recording another album.  So she certainly has plans.  Discussing with you right now.  After her next child, to get back on the road, keep touring, put another album out.  So I think we're just going to have to wait and see what, you know, this next album produces  to see what kind of star she's going to become.  And no matter what you have to say about her video on YouTube, we're still talking about it. 
[00:18:30]  Whenever a person did that, took that little video, dumb clip, it worked.  Because we're talking about her.  We're not talking about anybody else today.  We're not talking about U2.  We're not talking about The Stones.  We're talking about Britney Spears.  So, touche, Britney.  You did it.  Good for you.  What?  They cut it.  You go, girl.  Cut the good stuff.  I'm with Bob.  No, dude.  I said, I go, they're not talking about U2.  They're not talking about Bob Kelly at The Comedy Connection.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  You know, it was a great plug.  And the guy, you know, the guy was laughing his ass off. 
[00:19:00]  I said some stuff about a vagina.  Oh, that's good for CNN.  It's CNN, Bob.  But I said it with a B.  I made it cute.  Oh.  What was the other line before this?  What was the line right before this?  Oh, yeah, because that was the one.  Anything with a...  The baby.  Anything with a baby?  Wait, what was that?  How did he say it?  Anything with a baby.  Don't have a baby.  And if you're going to adopt, like Brad and Angelina.  Yeah, why don't you just say Bennifer?  What the...  Fucking, like Brad and Angelina.  Who are you, a fucking big-titted blonde on Entertainment Tonight? 
[00:19:30]  Let me tell you what's happening, dude.  Hold on.  Let's say hi to Manny in Jersey.  Manny, you saw Bob Kelly on Spike TV?  Yeah, I saw him last night on that, where they play casino games.  It's Stern's horse-faced girlfriend and the guy from Big Pussy or whatever from...  Sharepa, yeah.  They were just reading their script off the teleprompter like the idiots they are. 
[00:20:00]  And every time Bob tried to do something impromptu, it just walked all over him.  It was ridiculous.  Hey, Bob, they were following a script?  Dude, they have the teleprompter, but I...  They sent me one with Dennis Rodman, and they were talking to Dennis.  It was...  Look, I don't blame them.  Who the fuck is Bob Kelly?  But they were just reading...  The Times is supposed to be talking to me.  They just kept reading the teleprompter like, let's get the fuck out of here.  Right, right.  Who is Bob Kelly?  Bob Kelly is the originator...  No, Bob Kelly is the originator of the Porsche 911 juice man bit. 
[00:20:30]  Bob Kelly is the man who pointed out that Brad and Angelina, I want to just mush my almonds  into your face right now.  And he also...  He's also the guy that pointed out that you have the same face as a thumb puppet.  Yeah, he did point out that hurtful fact.  All right.  Ah!  Ah!  Bob, what do you think of Britney?  Ah!  How about that juicer?  Ah!  Babies or adoption, Bob? 
[00:21:00]  Ah!  Ah!  What?  Ah!  What?  Ah!  What?  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, just get Betsy.  I want to see you, me, the Lamborghini, the juicer.  We're all good cookies.  Ah!  Is this on?  Ah!  Let's go to Bill in Minnesota.  Bill.  Hey, guys.  I had a chance to watch CNN. 
[00:21:30]  Actually, I thought the interview went pretty well.  You thought Bob did well on CNN?  Thank you.  Thank you, dude.  It's not you.  Oh, God.  Wow, Bob.  This service really got me.  I fell for it, too.  Yeah, Bob.  That's got to hurt.  All right, listen.  One of Beth's comments, we're completely off base with you, Bob.  I didn't appreciate when I heard this. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, that's uncalled for.  She was actually really nice.  Shut up.  All right, nice talking to you.  All right, Bob.  Here's the deal.  We're trying to get your TV appearance, but our system just broke down.  So stay close so we can call you back, okay?  All right, cool.  You got it, guys.  Bob didn't take any guff from Beth O.  No?  No.  Here's his comment.  Goddamn rich cunt.  I kill rich cunt.  Wow.  And they punched each other in the face. 
[00:22:30]  How did you get that off of you?  Way to play along.  All right, Bob.  Way to play along.  Jesus.  Oh, my God.  I like your improv skills.  They're terrific.  All right, Bob.  We're going to call you back when we get that TV thing fixed.  All right, guys.  I'll talk to you.  All right.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  Very good.  Yo, check one, two.  This is definitely Flavor Flavor on your radio.  Just to let y'all know, y'all are definitely listening to the worst.  I mean the worst of Opie and Anthony right here. 
[00:23:00]  Opie and Anthony.  And now, the worst black of Opie and Anthony.  This show sucks.  It's awful.  Do you kiss on a birthday?  Yeah, yeah, whatever.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Wait, can I give a quick thank you, by the way, to Doom Warfare? 
[00:23:30]  No!  He sent me Mondo Topless.  I can't wait to watch it.  Thank you, buddy, very much.  I just got it.  That's very cool.  Well, we were talking about hurricanes and scuba diving,  and Bob Kelly was very excited to get in on the conversation  and decide to tell us about his snuba.  He did snuba adventure.  What is snuba?  It's a cross between snorkeling and scuba diving.  I get it.  What is it?  How did they make scuba diving a faggot? 
[00:24:00]  Snorkeling is cooler than snuba.  Really?  Yes.  I really was trying.  I thought you would.  Well, Opie was like, yeah, they get great diving.  And he's like, yeah, I was 20 feet under the water there.  Wow.  What is it?  A big, long snorkel?  My ears hurt.  What is snuba?  Exactly what is it?  You have a corksucker?  They give you just like a big bowl of air, basically.  No, no, no, no.  No, not the big one.  They give you a tank.  You get a tank like you, except you don't put it on the back.  Maybe it's cooler than I'm thinking that.  They put it on a float up top, and you get a 20-foot cord. 
[00:24:30]  So basically, you wear the belt.  You wear everything except the tank.  Except they don't want you to have the responsibility of having the tank on your back.  Well, you can't go down more than 20 feet.  20 feet under the water is a lot of pressure.  10 feet's enough.  There are monsters under that water.  Monsters.  That's terrific.  That's not terrific.  Can you see now where normally your sundress blow up in your face?  That'd be sick. 
[00:25:00]  I went snuggling.  Yeah, did you?  Snuggling?  What's it called?  Snuba.  Sounds like that's Snuba.  Snuba.  They got to change the name to make it sound cool.  Aren't those fellows?  They sell it to air?  You know when you're talking to Opie during the break, and he takes out a pen and a piece  of paper, and you're like, ah.  And starts jotting it down.  Fuck me.  Snuba.  They should give that a cooler name, like blowing someone.  I was 20 feet under, and it's a shipwreck.  It's like a big shipwreck.  It's unbelievable.  It's literally like 60 feet long. 
[00:25:30]  It looks like the Titanic, especially under the water.  The big fish the size of you are coming around.  It's pretty creepy.  Yeah.  And this dumb couple from Cuba, they tap me under 20 feet under.  I'm trying to join myself.  Look, doing the sign language, they give me the camera, and I start snapping photos.  I look.  It's a regular disposable camera.  They just took it under the water.  They thought it was...  These fucking morons.  What do they know, dude?  They probably swam there from their home apartment.  They didn't even know where they were.  They weren't even on the tour.  They just swam in. 
[00:26:00]  They thought you spoke Cuban.  The truck sank, and that's when they ended up in the snow.  They didn't know.  I saw a moray eel.  Yeah.  I was in Hawaii for my honeymoon, and we were snorkeling.  It was off of Maui, off of the Black Rock right there.  And the guy who was out there with us teaches us.  I don't know.  He was out there.  I don't know.  And I was snorkeling.  And fish all around me, and something big and cold touched me.  I looked down, and it was the largest fucking turtle I've ever seen in my... 
[00:26:30]  It was bigger than me, okay?  And it was all gnarly and had shit growing off of it, and it scared the shit out of me.  Ain't no reason to go under there.  Nah.  Dude, ugh.  Ain't no reason to go underwater like that.  What the fuck is under there?  You can watch on Discovery.  That's amazing.  Discovery Channel in high definition.  That's all I need, my friend.  It's amazing.  Fuck going down there with those monsters.  When you go down, you know, about 100 feet or so, and you get to, like, you know, swim.  100 feet.  It's a little...  Yeah, his cord doesn't go that far.  100 feet. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, 100 feet.  That's going to take that.  That's going to take that.  100 feet.  Your mic stinks today, Gavin.  100 feet.  I noticed that an hour ago.  I was hoping someone was going to fix it.  Well, talk into it.  See if you...  Hello, hello, hello.  That's better.  Maybe you have to be right on top of it.  So now I apologize to the people I just slammed.  Make like you're snooping and put it in your mouth.  I'm trying to be...  Yeah, exactly.  But when you snoober, they actually give you balls to cup.  And it's actually some Hawaiian instructor holding your head under.  It's in his tub, and they fucking throw, like, little super goldfish, and you eat them. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, little baiters.  No, the food, I mean, like the little snack food.  The multicolored goldfish.  I actually did the other one, too, where it's like a little scooter.  Oh, you did a little scooter?  It's like a bubble of air over you, like a little submarine.  Yeah.  From your nipples down, it's in the water, like in a scooter.  And you just go...  You can ride around, it's like a little motorcycle.  And you zoom around the bottom, like this little road. 
[00:28:00]  And you follow the fat guy and his wife.  That's pretty wild.  How far down are you?  20 feet.  Oh.  I think 20 feet.  Let me tell you something.  As you're going down, he goes down 100 feet, man.  That's a lot of...  That's a lot of...  Dude, that pressure was killing me at 20.  You got to know how to equalize, my brother.  Yeah, exactly.  You got to push it.  Welcome to the world of your feet.  That was very hurtful.  Very hurtful, but very precise.  Yeah.  Almost like a surgeon on that one.  Wow. 
[00:28:30]  My feet try to blow their nose to release the pressure.  Wait, let's say hi to Chris in North Carolina.  Chris?  Yeah, I just wanted to let Bob Kelly know that, you know, I'm not a historian, but I think  the Titanic was a little bit longer than 60 feet, punching out.  The key word would be like, jackass.  I know that.  I exaggerated to get the fucking point across, you dumb redneck.  And you're like a cunt.  How's that sound?  Dude, it was like the Titanic, the boat.  No, no, the DVD thing.  It was only a couple feet long. 
[00:29:00]  What's wrong with you, Bob?  I'm so angry.  I don't know.  He just made me.  I didn't like it.  Fucking.  He made me mad.  I'm sorry.  Bob, why?  Because you said something about my feet, and I took it out on him.  I went home and kicked the dog, Jim.  I was molested!  Thank you for being here.  You were happier.  Wait a minute.  What happened?  What just popped out there?  What just popped out?  Snooba.  I want to go snooba diving.  Let me ask you a question.  When you go down to 100 feet, what kind of fish do you?  You must see sharks and stuff down there, right?  I've never seen a shark. 
[00:29:30]  I've seen, like, long barracudas and turtles and...  I don't know.  How about a nurse shark?  Do you ever see a nurse shark?  Nurse shark.  Those big, worthless sharks.  With the fangs.  They don't really bite you.  But they do nothing.  They can bite you.  They don't even smother the elderly like a good nurse.  They bite a lot of people.  They bite a lot of people, Jim.  Oh, fuck a nurse shark.  I'll put my dick in its mouth and laugh at it.  It'll bite it off.  You got bitten by a nurse shark.  Put a fucking gun in your mouth.  The reason they bite a lot of people is because they're real shallow and people step on them  and they bite you.  Well, yeah, they're reacting like, hey, your foot's on me. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  That's why they bite a lot of people.  Great white, you don't have to step on for it to fucking bite you.  It doesn't just lay there like a big fat nothing.  Hi, I'm a nurse shark, are you?  I'll pick it up by its cock and throw it.  The craziest...  There's no joke here, but when I started scuba diving in Turks and Caicos, that was about  60 to 70 feet down, okay, beginner dives more or less, and there's a shelf.  Don't tell me.  And the instructor was really cool, so he let us go over the shelf. 
[00:30:30]  Ah, that scares me.  In a semicircle and then back, you know what I'm saying?  So we go out a little bit, and it was just complete darkness.  It's fucked up.  And then we get back on the boat, and he goes, yeah, where I had you guys out, it drops  pretty much a mile straight down.  That's so fucked up, man.  I'm glad you didn't tell me beforehand.  I just thought maybe it was another 100 feet or so, even that would be, you know,  I was sinking into the boat.  No, no, you don't, you kind of like, you don't know which way is up, because, you know, 
[00:31:00]  you're spinning around and stuff, you fool around with it a little bit.  You have to follow the bubbles, right?  And you're all equal.  I mean, you're wearing so much belt that...  Well, no, the whites are...  No, the whites are much...  I could have had you...  But that was like, that was crazy, yeah.  Dude, that's just...  That thought of that is retarded.  And you just look out, and all you see is just complete darkness, and you're wondering  what's on the other side of that.  Monster.  I was actually...  The middle of the boat was cracked open.  Apparently, this big, huge vessel was on the... 
[00:31:30]  Exactly.  It was just cracked open, and you...  I think when you let your air out, you sink, right?  Something like that.  How do you...  When you let your air out, when you breathe out, you'll go down.  I don't know the rules of snoob, I'm sorry.  Well, it's a rule.  Here's the rules of snoob, when the cock pops out of your mouth, you're done snoobing.  Do you wear a weight belt?  No.  I'm not stepping into that fat joke, Anthony. 
[00:32:00]  You're out of your mind.  I swear to you, it wasn't a fat joke.  There's a fucking Dom DeLuise joke coming in.  No, I wanted to know because...  He's wearing an asteroid belt.  That'll get a cruise ship anchor to...  I was going to ask, because I know that the weight belts are used to give you neutral  buoyancy with the tanks on your back.  You wear one.  So you wear one.  You wear one.  It's not like a heavy...  He took my weight belt and kept taking weight out of it.  He basically gave me a belt with no weight.  He wound up having to put swimmies on his arms.  He gave me a Chanel belt.  I was going to say, he gave you a belt with styrofoam. 
[00:32:30]  Should have given you a belt of scotch.  That's kind of funny.  Yeah, that was good.  Can I...  You never get a car crash, do you?  Never?  Thank you.  Are you kidding me?  I'll give him this.  Never get a car crash.  They call me Harry Chapin sometimes.  Oh, he bounds immediately.  You saw a barracuda.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I saw a barracuda when I was snorkeling. 
[00:33:00]  Scary looking.  Man, and they say, oh, they won't bite you, mate.  Don't worry about it.  I don't believe it.  It's bullshit.  I was pretty much freaked out by that.  Barracuda's an unbelievable fucking pirate ship.  I thought he just said that.  Who told you that?  The bird on your shoulder?  Cocksucker.  They won't bite you, mate.  They won't bite you, mate.  I did that for this tea-sipping jackass next to me.  Did they tell you that?  Why are you doing the mic?  Why are you doing the scrimshaw?  Jason from Rye on the instant feedback.  I love how grown-up Anthony is.  Ope, this is... 
[00:33:30]  Wait, Ope.  What's on the other side?  This doesn't make sense, but it says Ope.  What's on the other side?  Ant.  Monsters.  Yeah, what about it?  Monsters.  That's all that's down there are monsters.  That's what I keep saying.  Dude, there's...  There's no monsters.  There's monsters down there.  They don't breathe air.  Right.  You're in their environment where the second you don't have your fucking air with you,  you're dead.  Giant squids.  Fuck that shit.  Dude, they have snubba.  Snubba.  Yeah, just climb up your snubba cord.  I'm telling you, that's a lifesaver. 
[00:34:00]  When you got that, you can always look up.  I was sinking in the middle of the boat.  Like I said, I had a big crack.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, you just start sinking, and it just goes dark.  What do you do?  Just start jerking the snubba wire?  It goes dark in the boat.  It raises you out of the water.  Look at 20 foot.  You don't go dark.  I was in the...  It doesn't go dark.  Listen to me, dude.  20 feet down?  I was in the boat.  In the vessel.  Ope, in the vessel.  Is it his bathroom?  Exactly.  I feel like he's doing some deep sea diving with one of those big helmets. 
[00:34:30]  It was Jacques Cousteau just brought out of the Steinbeck novel.  It was dark.  You climbed down the boat right there and you were on the floor of the ocean.  You see some frizzy feet?  Open your eyes, you dummy.  Frizzy feet?  I forgot the second.  Dark.  Stubb and Gaff said, open your eyes.  Oh, wait.  You're right.  I did close my eyes.  I was in the boat.  They turned the lights off at the aquarium.  You were in fucking Vegas in the MGM just looking at fish in the hallway.  I'm snubing. 
[00:35:00]  I'm trying to snubing.  I was in.  Let me explain myself a little better and help you guys out.  Maybe you misunderstood.  Apparently, we went down the wrong track and it might have been my fault.  I was in, there's a big boat, okay, and a vessel and it had a hole in it from one of the explosions.  Well, you're going down there for booty and gold.  Or you're going down there for plenty of the blues.  And then as I sunk into the hole, I like to call it the abyss. 
[00:35:30]  An octopus guy came out.  The abyss.  And it got dark.  David Jones.  It got very dark.  What happened next, old cum beard?  He meant peg leg and he put the peg right in his asshole and got fucked by it.  That's a long job.  Do you have a bumper sticker now that says, I'd rather be snuba-ing?  You don't put it on your car, you put it on your broth bowl. 
[00:36:00]  Your time's over.  Fucking homo.  Wow, you're an adventurer.  Oh my God.  You're a risk taker, man.  Wow.  Did you also go to Seaside Heights on a safari?  Shit.  I'm tired.  I'm tired.  Fucking snuba, man.  Oh, I had to fucking slap your face.  I cannot wait to see the Photoshop.  It got dark down there.  It was dark down there.  Plenty dark it was. 
[00:36:30]  Matey.  Eighteen feet.  Eighteen feet.  I fucking only went out into fucking a mile fucking foot of water.  I'm in 20 feet.  It was dark.  I'd reach the end of me snuba-line.  If we go to my blog, snuba.com, they'll lead the rest of my story.  Two of us went in the water.  Two of us come back out.  You were on the Indianapolis.  I'll never snuba again.  We were floating in the water, cocks all over.  We had to fight theirs to suck them. 
[00:37:00]  It's not a good Robert Shubb.  It wasn't.  It was actually fucking a good bono from U2.  Can you hear the bono from U2?  Sorry, bono.  I was thinking I was killed hitting a tree skiing.  Wow.  I'm fucking fluffed.  Wow.  Cross that one out.  Cross snuba out of your fucking notebook of death.  Oh, snuba.  Fucking goddamn notebook sucks.  That mean self-esteem's been smashing that fucking notebook. 
[00:37:30]  That's like the fucking, what's that movie with the book?  Snuba equals sucking nuts underwater with balls in ass.  Wow.  Thank you, Jason from Rye.  What were you saying, like the movie about the book?  The notebook?  What's that?  No, no, no, that movie.  It's not an adventure if you can hear him talking on a boner.  Yeah.  That's what that book is.  If you look up and you see two guys on the dock, you're not fucking scooping.  There's no dock.  You're out in the middle of the fucking ocean. 
[00:38:00]  Yeah, you are.  Because the middle of the ocean is 20 feet deep.  It's not 20.  It's 60 feet.  It's 60 feet.  It's 60 feet.  You said 20.  You don't go to, I can only go 20.  He's in Central Park.  We're in a lagoon.  He's in Central Park.  I'm telling you right now.  He's in the deep side of the pool, Bob.  That's a dead pool, all right?  He's going to make it down to the drain.  He has piss and everything.  You guys can't, everybody, you guys can't get him out quick enough.  You're like fucking Barracuda.  It's like I'm back snoobering again.  Give me that notebook, that Necronomicon, whatever the fuck it is. 
[00:38:30]  The only thing that went.  Did you say snoobering?  That's hilarious.  Snoobering R.  The only thing that went down was you on the instructor.  Oh, wow.  I really tried to bond with Ope.  Yeah, snoober.  He went, really?  He went like, excuse me, what did you say?  Snoober?  When I heard you say snoober, I just, like, in my head, I went, oh, my God, no. 
[00:39:00]  It's over.  It's over.  And I had to ask what it was.  20 feet's not even deep enough to get a Kennedy victim out of the water.  I'm fucking taking deeper dives than fucking Manhattan clam chowder.  Thanks, you snoober story.  Big fucking deep sea adventure.  Fucking get a friend with a pool and fuck yourself.  It's not an adventure if you could touch the bottom of the pool, yeah, you fucking ass.  I, oh, Jesus Christ. 
[00:39:30]  Stupid Norton's spitting up fucking almond dust.  Oh, it makes me so happy.  I can't believe this is so great.  I'm going to go snoobering again in a couple weeks.  That's great.  Have fun.  How long does it take?  You have to go, you have to get a license to snooble.  I'm a loser.  I need to dive, right?  I'm a loser because I, I, I'm not certified.  So every time I go on vacation, I go through the dumb courses again.  How long does that take?  I've gone through the courses three or four times.  Why'd you get your Nari card?  I'm just an idiot.  How long does it take? 
[00:40:00]  Honestly, to get certified on vacation, you could do it in a week.  Yeah.  But I'll, I'll do a quick refresher course for like, I don't know, like an afternoon and then I'm diving again.  Because I, I talk my way.  Do you learn in the water or no?  It's easy, man.  It's the coolest thing I've ever done in my life.  Can you get certified in the pool?  It's scary, dude.  I'll tell you what, man.  Get certified in pools in Manhattan.  Folks out there, don't ever do that, okay?  Get certified before you go in the ocean, okay?  Where do you go, where do you go, though?  Huh?  Where do you go?  It's easy.  Well, last year I went to the Cayman Islands.  Yeah.  And then the water's just crystal clear.  Cayman Islands was awesome because you take a boat out, it's not even a half mile offshore, 
[00:40:30]  and it's, and, and those dives are only 60 or 70 feet, but it's perfect.  That's it.  60, 70.  You run out of cord.  I was 60, I was 60 feet.  The boat is 60 feet.  You're out, you're 60 feet of, no, you can only go 20.  The cord only allows you to go 20.  They don't want you going any deeper than that.  Oh, so you're floating.  You're floating in 60 feet of water.  Oh, I got you.  Here's what you want to do.  Same thing.  Oh, I got you.  It's, it's deep.  It's off the coast.  I mean, it's really deep.  You can't look, you can only look down. 
[00:41:00]  No, you get to go down 20 feet.  So you can literally go sink inside of this, this, this, this wreck.  You can only sink 20 feet.  But it's inside of a vessel.  Is it?  Why don't you do this?  How creepy, how creepy is it to go 20 feet down, Opie?  Honest to God.  20 feet is nothing.  Like I said.  How creepy is it to go 60 feet down, Opie?  It's not, it's not that bad.  How creepy is it to know that there's things around you?  No.  How creepy is it when you know there's monsters in the closet? 
[00:41:30]  How creepy would it be to see you in swim trunks with a bell on your head?  Ding, ding, ding.  You quickly realize when you scuba dive that just about everything in the water scared you.  Not everything.  Just about.  Well, that's the key.  Just about.  Well, everything I saw.  98%.  Here comes that one, two percent that isn't.  You know.  Dude, a bull shark or a tiger shark is just, not even a great white.  A great white doesn't go near warm water.  I saw reef sharks when I was snorkeling.  It was part of the thing we did.  How big is a reef shark? 
[00:42:00]  They look like, they're, I don't know, eight feet or so?  A white tip can get up to like 10, 12 feet.  There's some of the Bahamas that you can.  Well, this is the problem with the Bahamas.  You go down there, they don't have rules like America.  Bill Burr and I talked about this.  It's all good.  Everything's all good.  Yeah.  It's all good.  We went snorkeling, they said, you go to three different spots and the third spot, you get  to see nurse sharks.  And what they do basically is a part of this area, they have a, like a.  I don't think Jimmy likes the nurse sharks.  They have a, they have like a bait box. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  That they leave on the bottom of the ocean, which is honestly 40, 50 feet down, I guess.  So you're snorkeling on the top of the water and you get to see the nurse, the reef  sharks come and feed, you know, from the, the, the feed box or whatever.  But then they start circling up because they're curious.  And then all of a sudden, all of a sudden the instructor's like, all right, everyone  out of the water.  Like, you know, they're taking a chance every time they, they do this, this run.  Yeah.  The sharks probably aren't going to bother you.  And then, and then when we all got in the boat, they start throwing chum and these things  were jumping out of the water and just in a huge feeding frenzy. 
[00:43:00]  And you're thinking, I was just in the water with this crap.  Yeah.  When I was, I was 15, I was in Australia and the family, host family that had us, they had  like an 82 foot yacht and they would take people out there.  There's an Island off of, um, off of, uh, Melbourne.  It's two islands.  One's a penguin sanctuary and the other one's a seal sanctuary.  Oh, and there's.  What do they hand you when you go to them?  A bat and a video camera?  No, no.  You can't, you can't even land at them.  There's no place to land.  It's just, it's just two rocks.  But the channel in between has got the most amazing sharks. 
[00:43:30]  These great whites will breach out of the water to kill a seal.  So you'll just be sitting there and you'll see a bunch of seals.  And then all of a sudden one will just take off flying in the air.  They'll just, boom, just be launched out of there.  It makes you real small.  Do you go to the penguin sanctuary?  Wah, wah, wah.  Funk.  Steel toad boots.  Black blood dripping on the.  I'm a fan buffalo wing style.  You go have some lamps.  Here's your fucking metal boots.  Have a lamp.  There's plenty of them.  Max from Fairfield.  Take a golf club. 
[00:44:00]  Max.  Yeah, the water was only 20 feet, but it displaced to 60 as soon as Bob stepped into it.  That was pretty good, Max.  You guys are using water displacement in a joke.  Oh, he really did.  In the ocean.  Wonderful.  That's ridiculous.  A seal sanctuary and a fucking penguin sanctuary.  I don't know where I want to lay barbed wire first.  Oh, my dick is hard.  Just thinking about all the things I could slap with fat stomachs.  Look at the seal.  Wah, wah.  Whack.  A nice golf club to the belly. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, I'm not some faggotty environmentalist kid.  These seals get thrown up like 20 feet in the air, dude.  It's amazing.  They just, I mean, these like 400 pound seals just flying.  Just pieces of them, just pummeled by a great white.  Phenomenal.  Love the snuba.  Oh, I'd fucking push them into the water if I saw a shark fin.  Wah, wah, wah.  Fucking boot right to the back of its fucking black head.  Bon voyage.  Oh, yeah.  Beat it, white stomach.  Phenomenal. 
[00:45:00]  God damn.  Anything else you want to share about?  Yeah.  Not only do you have that pen and that notebook near you.  Any of the tender moments?  Really?  What the fuck?  I just wanted to be fucking, you know, like snuba buddies, Opie.  I wanted to be, I want to, hey, you got stories.  I got a knife.  I bought a knife for my ankle in case something would happen.  Hey.  You know when you want to meet, you know when you meet snuba buddies, there's a hole in the  wall while you're watching pornographic videos. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  I need some air.  And he puts his fucking oxygen hose through and then he shoots some air down your throat.  You chew some gum and go home.  Let's go to Corey in Jersey.  Corey.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  You were saying you can get certified in a pool in Manhattan.  Not true.  Yeah, because you got to do your open water dive, right?  Yeah, but you can do your training.  You can do all your courses and stuff.  Yeah, pools in Manhattan just teach you how to be raped by wilding teenagers.  You can do your dives in the islands, though.  Yeah, no, I was mistaken.  You can take all the classes and stuff, but you still have to do like an open water dive. 
[00:46:00]  How much does it cost?  You know, it varies.  Like a fancy guy like Opie, you know, he could have whatever schedule he wants.  You know, I used to charge, I taught diving for about 12 years.  And, you know, a fancy man like Opie, I'd charge him a couple grand, and, you know, he's good.  How much do you charge an unfancy fat man that snoopers?  Snoopers.  Of course, probably 300, 400 bucks.  That's it?  That's it.  So, two grand for Opie and 350 for me?  Well, I...  At least you could do it like a man. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Well, you don't...  Hey, sir, are you a professional?  You're a professional.  Is snooping...  Is that...  That's not bad, right?  It's Liberace gay.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, it really is.  You're very, very, very...  Now, how much does a tank cost?  Do you have to buy your own tank?  No, you can...  Or is it like barbecuing?  Do you just go and you return that tank and get a brand full one?  Propane.  How much does a suit cost?  And does it come in double X?  Suit?  You don't need a suit.  Get all kinds of suits.  Yeah, they go up to about a double X, and then they stop, because I've tried to get... 
[00:47:00]  I've got to get a vest made for me if I want to go.  I taught a guy that weighed over 400 pounds.  Would you teach him to stop eating?  I would.  Apparently not.  All right, Corey.  Thank you.  What did you do?  Eating the fish like slam?  Yeah.  He was eating fish like sushi, just in the water.  He's chasing squid.  Let's say hi to Dave in Jersey.  Dave.  Hey, Bob.  Lift up your shirt and show the guys your propeller scar.  Fucking manatee bastard.  Propeller scar.  I like the fucking manatee at the end. 
[00:47:30]  Just in case no one got it.  Just in case nobody got it.  Even though he did get it.  He threw that in.  He threw the ending in.  That was pretty good, you fucking jackass.  Hey, this is Geraldo Rivera, and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It was awful.  Worthless.  They're the worst.  Just screaming every racial epithet you can think of.  An abomination.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:48:00]  Let's begin.  Everybody back?  Everybody back in New York?  Holy.  Holy crap.  Holy crap.  Back from the road, man.  That's right.  Man.  Man.  Back from the road.  It's a tough old life on the road, man.  Did a little road trip, did we? 
[00:48:30]  Back in New York City.  Has been a while since we've taken to the road.  Nice, though.  Fun.  Exciting.  A lot of stories get conjured up when we take to the road.  There's little factions.  Then we all get together and tell our little stories.  Little tribes come together under the wigwam and tell us stories of tragedy, stories of happiness, stories of a-holes. 
[00:49:00]  And we got pictures.  Yeah, pictures.  And we have video.  And we have video.  So the next few days are going to be very interesting for the Opie and Anthony show.  I cannot imagine a larger collection of jackasses than the people that travel around with us.  The fans, some of the staff, us, just cannot conduct themselves like civilized human beings. 
[00:49:30]  Or just stay out of trouble.  Or just not bother me.  All right.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  For the new listeners out there that don't have a clue, we had our first O&A traveling virus.  Yes, we did.  The comedy event of 2006, we played Worcester at the DCU Center up there in Massachusetts. 
[00:50:00]  And it was just a huge success.  Huge success.  The reviews are in, and I believe it's well over 90% positive.  Yeah.  Well over 90% positive.  And for the first one, we are very, very happy.  The shakedown.  The test flight.  I really didn't think it would be as good as it was.  Through the whole thing, everybody was saying, oh my god, this is going so well. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  I can't believe this is going.  And I just kept saying, shut up.  You're going to jinx it.  Something's going to happen.  Well, we actually decided to organize something.  Yeah.  Over the years, we've been known for our road shows, where we just show up somewhere,  just make sure there's enough beer, and then we just make up crap as we go along.  Yeah.  Just hop on the stage, drag people up from the show, and screw around.  Don't really have anything to say.  Hey, it's just pretty much, hey, remember this guy? 
[00:51:00]  You throw him up on stage kind of a thing.  Yeah, we organized this one.  Yeah.  And we had a production team and everything.  A schedule.  We had a schedule we had to follow.  Schedule.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  It was unbelievable.  E-Rock's working on the pictures from our Boston trip, including our day at BCN.  And after our BCN show up there in Boston on Friday, we decided to buy breakfast for about  a hundred or, I don't know, maybe a couple hundred listeners, I guess, at IHOP.  There were a lot less when we left the BCN parking lot than when we got there. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  And it was only a few blocks away.  Yeah.  I think people just started following.  They heard they were going to get a free breakfast and started following us like the Pied Piper.  Yeah, it was a nice crowd.  We walked at IHOP.  I'm looking at some of the pictures because E-Rock's working on them right now to get up  on opandanthony.com.  And there's a nice picture of us, me, you, and Jimmy around a round table broadcasted live  from IHOP as our listeners are enjoying a free breakfast.  Ah, yes.  Aren't we nice? 
[00:52:00]  It was just crazy.  It's good to be back home.  My voice is kind of coming back.  Yeah.  That's what happens.  You just lose your voice.  Real beat.  Where the hell do we begin?  The O&H album Virus, the comedy event of 2006.  We got three or four more dates.  All the info is up on opandanthony.com.  Next stop, PNC Arts Center in Jersey.  Oh, yeah.  And ticket sales are crazy.  It turned out in Worcester at the DCU Center, we did about 6,000 people.  Yeah.  I'll be honest with you. 
[00:52:30]  I thought we would do a lot better.  But it wasn't a bad showing, considering we've only been back on regular radio in Massachusetts  for like 90 days.  I think we would have also if we were closer to Boston.  Yeah.  Well, we got kicked out of Boston.  The mayor's holding a grudge, so we couldn't play the Tweeter Center where we wanted to play  because this is definitely an outdoor show.  Yeah.  This works much better as an outdoor show.  Maybe the mayor should worry about keeping the big dig from falling on people's heads and  stop holding a grudge against the radio show.  There you go.  How about that? 
[00:53:00]  Big dig.  I was reading the Sunday papers on the way back to New York yesterday.  He doesn't even have a staff.  No.  He doesn't even have like a chief of police and all those people you need.  Homeland Security doesn't have a top dog for that.  It's obvious.  He doesn't have a school, what is it called?  Chancellor?  A chancellor, whatever the biggest.  Chancellor.  The biggest job in the school thing is he doesn't have any of them.  Doesn't have any of those people?  What, he's just been like walking around being the mayor without any staff?  The papers are pretty much saying he hasn't had a farm system for new talent, and a lot 
[00:53:30]  of these guys have moved on, and he hasn't filled the positions.  He is really a bad mayor.  And then he's got this tunnel where now people are dying because it wasn't constructed right.  But, you know, he's going to make sure he keeps us out of Boston, make sure it's very  hard to get permits signed so we can do our stupid comedy show.  Because that's important.  That's important.  If you're driving through one of these tunnels and a huge plate pancakes your car, that's 
[00:54:00]  nothing big.  Right, right.  We're an ass.  So instead we moved it out to the DCU Center in Worcester, and they were great at the DCU Center.  I mean, it's a crap hole.  Oh, yeah.  It is a crap hole.  The DCU Center's a dump.  Worcester in general, they're trying to revive.  Are they?  But, yeah, you saw some construction projects, but it's like, I don't know.  I don't know.  It's like duct taping an old car or something. 
[00:54:30]  I don't know what I saw.  I'll tell you what I saw.  Albany.  That's what Worcester is.  It's Albany.  I said, like, some parts of Buffalo that we had seen.  Yeah.  Like the impoverished parts.  Yeah.  That was pretty much it.  And then we get to the hotel in Worcester.  The nicest hotel in Worcester.  The nicest hotel in Worcester was, like, just pretty much a crap hole.  It wasn't that bad, but it was just, you know, a basic lodging hotel. 
[00:55:00]  Did you sleep in yesterday?  Did you sleep in yesterday?  A lodging hotel.  I didn't leave until about 1.  I was having the buffet with all the other listeners.  The whole hotel was filled with O&A listeners.  It was infested with pests.  Yeah.  Well, they all were, you know, they traveled to go to the show, and they needed a place  to stay.  And they all decided to stay at the Crowne Plaza like they did.  So it was like a block away from the venue.  And so we're eating some buffet, and you hear a rendition of the Lion King happening. 
[00:55:30]  Just the Lion King was happening in one of the banquet rooms, I guess.  And then they had some kind of, like, Baptist ceremony going on.  Well, the Baptist church was across the street.  Across the street?  It was in our hotel.  Was it?  I heard them singing.  Because I heard the bells chime out over there.  And they were awful.  That's what you get some nice singing out of a Baptist church.  Not in Worcester, man.  They were out of tune.  I noticed there were a lot of black people were in the hotel and around that area. 
[00:56:00]  It seems to be a very urban part of Worcester that we were in.  And I just got to say, my girlfriend blurted out one of the funniest racist jokes I ever heard  when we walked out on the balcony and overlooked a lot of black people in the pool.  I won't repeat it, but it was a very funny racist joke.  Jesus.  I think you could figure it out.  So the pictures are going up from our Boston trip, as we speak, opieandanthony.com. 
[00:56:30]  And let's mention, when we get to the DCU Center, remind me to talk about the shirt that I couldn't sell there.  Yeah, let's do it.  I'm going to firebomb that dump.  It's a smorgasbord of what happened is what we're going to do for the first part of the show today.  Yeah, we got Boston trip highlights starting with BCN after show.  We had to meet the sales staff up there at BCN and clients and stuff.  So they threw a little lunch together for us.  And then Keith the Cop told everyone he went into the conference room and made an announcement that you and I needed the head seats at the table. 
[00:57:00]  It was one of these big meetings with a bunch of clients and everything, you know.  And we're supposed to go in there and put on the happy face and shake hands.  And it was cool.  We had a good time.  But Keith goes in beforehand and tells everybody, no, you can't sit there.  It's a huge, huge conference table.  One chair at one end, one at the other.  And he told everybody, make sure no one takes those seats because Opie and Anthony like sitting at the head of the table. 
[00:57:30]  And they don't want anybody else taking these seats.  And everyone thought he was serious because he put on the whole serious thing.  And then we walk in and now we're instantly like prima donna idiots to these people.  You know we are.  It's like, oh, OK, they're these kind of guys.  He also said you like being that far apart because you like to yell at each other during meetings.  Yeah, yeah.  So we need to be as far away as possible or it could get a little touchy.  And they all bought into it. 
[00:58:00]  Apparently one dude was sort of inching a little too close and he had to be like, no, no, no.  You're getting too close.  Too close.  We wound up sitting like at the corner of a table.  Yeah.  Next to each other.  People shocked.  I'm hearing through the instant feedback here.  There are already pictures online at WBCN.com.  So those are the pictures they took.  Our own people took pictures.  And they're going up on OpieNanthony.com.  There's going to be thousands of pictures from the weekend.  Lots of pictures.  Up on all the fan sites.  Lots of video, audio.  Right.  So then, I mean, well, Jimmy, talk about the shirts. 
[00:58:30]  Of course we have merch.  We sell our shirts.  Merch.  We got some merch, man.  Traveling virus shirts.  I have my own shirts.  I sell my stupid expressions on them.  Like, you stink.  I don't like you.  That type of crap.  One of the shirts I sell is from something I said a long time ago in the year, years ago.  So it's not rape if she blinks twice for yes.  Which is hilarious.  Granted, that's a little tasteless.  But, you know, it's kind of true.  And, you know, it's good to give a shirt like that to your girl because she'll go, oh, you goose.  And you've said it in your act, I believe. 
[00:59:00]  Probably, yeah.  I've seen you say that from the stage.  Have I?  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's part of, you know, it's part of you.  It's part of what you say.  It's part of your comedy.  And it's got my name under it.  And on the back, it's got my website.  And they were selling all the shirts, you know, and everything else.  But that's the one thing they wouldn't sell because they can't endorse rape.  It's not endorsing.  Of course it's not.  It's a T-shirt with a, you know, saying on the front.  So to whoever.  Offensive, but.  Yeah, I don't.  Well, it's funny.  They don't have a problem serving alcohol, which is pretty much the thing that causes 90% of the rapes. 
[00:59:30]  I mean, you know, you get loaded.  You get your face smashed into the passenger seat while your drunken date attacks you and you're trying to throw up out the passenger window.  They don't mind selling booze.  That's fine.  You get drunk.  You drive into a family.  Oh, sorry.  None of you can walk anymore.  Oops.  Not our problem.  Get everybody loaded and get them back into their cars.  That's fine.  But don't sell.  You want to talk about rape?  I'll tell you what rape is.  Rape is where the venue has to take 30% of the money you make on your merchandise. 
[01:00:00]  That's rape.  Yeah.  Huh?  It's the unions.  I understand.  But we're supposed to just sit here and go, oh, that's the unions?  Disgusting.  Someone explain to me why they get 30% to sell your stuff.  You show up with your stuff.  You could even sell your own stuff with your own people.  I'm going to lose my voice.  I have no voice left.  You can't touch the money.  They won't let you behind the merch booth.  And they get mad if you get anywhere as close to the merch booth.  You know why?  Because they're greedy scumbags.  Yeah.  Who was that woman that was getting all uptight over the fact that we wanted to pull a couple 
[01:00:30]  of tables aside.  So we can meet our listeners after the show.  People wanted us to sign stuff after they bought it.  So we needed a table set up and some kind of organization, a line being formed.  So we grab a table next to where they were selling shirts.  And this woman just lost her mind.  You can't do this.  You can't be back here.  We were like, shut up.  Shut up.  Just let us stand here.  These are people that paid money to come in here. 
[01:01:00]  And we're going to sign their stuff.  Yeah.  Why should you get a piece of my shirt?  Do you want to split the booze money?  Do I get a piece of the booze you're selling?  You dope.  Yeah.  We brought all those people there.  Of course.  So give us a little taste of the booze, man.  I've fought venues on that.  You get 30% of our stuff.  Why don't we get a little taste of the booze money?  I've fought venues on that.  Because once in a while, it's common knowledge as a performer.  A lot of times I'll do three-person shows where I'm closed and I'll have two guys open or whatever.  And they want a liquor break.  They want you to take a break in between the two and then the headline act.  We took a liquor break for them. 
[01:01:30]  I never would have.  I mean, they might have given us a better deal on merch.  I never do unless they give me a really good deal on the merch.  Oh, a little trade-off.  Always.  You want to split the booze money?  No?  Okay.  Well, then you know what?  You're not getting a liquor break.  You've got to let us wet our beaks.  Yes.  Like all those rape t-shirts you have in your pockets.  Like so many nickels and dimes.  If you want to sell, how long was the liquor break?  20, 25 minutes?  How long was that break?  It was supposed to be 15, but it was closer to a half hour.  Almost a half hour. 
[01:02:00]  The money they make on alcohol on that break, what makes you more money, that or a percentage  from the shirt?  I almost guarantee it's more money from the booze.  Right.  So it's like you want to-  30% though.  And we like to sell our stuff as cheap as possible, so we had to raise our price a little bit  just to kind of make some shekels.  And they only had the two tables on, small tables on complete opposite ends.  The main question I got was, where are the shirts?  Yeah, a lot of people had no clue.  I was reading the message boards, and a few people said, you know, it would have made 
[01:02:30]  the event better if the guys that performed and O&A would have been available to sign  stuff after the show.  We did.  Meanwhile, we were.  We were there at the table, one of the tables that was selling stuff.  Some people had no clue where we were.  We signed stuff until we almost fell asleep.  Yeah, we stayed.  We stayed for a really long time.  Long time.  It was probably a couple hours after the show.  Yep.  I hate that.  I have to apologize to the people at the end of the line. 
[01:03:00]  They were trying to talk to us, and at that point, my eyelids were so heavy.  I just wanted to crash so bad.  And speaking of merch, my brother's in studio because he's got to beg Ziggy for some forgiveness.  Here's another part.  Another faction that was off doing something that had an adventure.  Well, my brother got into a couple situations that were really funny.  But if you want, like, you know, the merch from the show, my brother came up with a couple  T-shirts for the O&A Traveling Virus. 
[01:03:30]  They're available on MyRadioStore.com.  That'll pay for the van, hopefully.  Well, that's what we're getting at here.  And Jimmy's shirts, of course, eatabullet.com and all his merch, eatabullet.com.  I don't owe anybody money, but if you want to just pay for some prostitutes for me.  Well, Ziggy from MyRadioStore.com brought the T-shirts up for the O&A Traveling Virus.  Actually, Danny drove the van, right? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, it was Danny driving it one way.  One way.  Danny then.  You know how the second way ended.  Danny couldn't drive.  I got video.  Every shot Danny is in.  I was laughing because I was putting it from my camera onto my computer last night when I got home.  So I was watching the whole thing.  And every shot Danny is in, he is drinking.  Danny is one of the many drunks who surrounds us.  We are surrounded by people who are going to die of cirrhosis.  We're drunks.  We're surrounded by alcoholics. 
[01:04:30]  We really are.  Danny was so loaded.  He was.  I just wanted to say thank you for all.  I'm getting ready to go on.  And he's literally sipping wine out of a plastic cup six inches from my face.  I just wanted to say thank you for that stuff you said on the air.  It was the drunkest I've ever seen.  That was so cool.  Well.  So cool.  Really?  We were doing the final counts.  We're getting all the stuff settled.  And he's sticking his A into the pal talk cameras. 
[01:05:00]  His hairy butt.  And I'm thinking this guy is driving us home in like five minutes.  Like, no.  No, he's not.  Like, what's going on here?  Yeah, he was a wreck.  So my brother had to drive the van back to the Crowne Plaza Hotel.  Back to the Crowne Plaza.  Which is, I swear to you, we can look at the building across the street from this studio.  It was two blocks.  Right now.  It was two blocks away.  And that's how far it is.  400 feet.  400 feet away.  The van drive back to the hotel. 
[01:05:30]  And my brother's, you know, you're drinking, right?  Very, very little.  Let everyone know out there.  I saw some of the message boards that booze had none a factor in it.  All right.  Just on Danny's end, of course, but not on my end.  Yeah.  It was either die at his hands or me drive this freaking van.  And I felt like Captain E.J. Smith of the HMS Titanic for a 400-foot journey, which ended very poorly.  I got to make it perfectly clear, Ziggy, from MyRadioStore.com, buy a T-shirt. 
[01:06:00]  He just got the van done with our faces.  Like, the artwork on his van is unbelievable.  And it cost him thousands of dollars.  You know, it's me, Anthony, and Jimmy, our faces on the side of the van.  It says XM Satellite Radio.  It says all sorts of other things.  It's just beautiful.  It really is.  He put a lot of work into his van.  So my brother's driving home from the DCU Center with the rest of the shirts and a drunk Danny in the passenger seat, which is key to the story. 
[01:06:30]  Did you mention that with the customization of this van, not only are our images all over it and the logos and everything,  but it's one of these extended top fiberglass on top of the vans.  Jeez, that information could have come in handy a couple days ago.  Yeah, it's one of these things.  It gives you extended headroom inside the van.  Right.  So, you know, people make campers out of them sometimes.  Gives you a little headroom almost.  It's got headroom for some merchandise or whatever the hell else you need.  Or you can walk around the back of the van a little bit without tucking down too low. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, a little bit without hunching over.  And it's just got our very professional wrap, they call it, around the van with our pictures and logo and everything.  Very nice.  It's a nice van.  Nice, nice van.  It was a nice van.  Well, you try to go into the parking garage.  All right, so, well, I drive a Jeep, a Laredo.  So, when I got in this van, it's the same exact thing.  I'm like, all right, fine.  Done this.  So, we drive the 400 feet, which takes, what, 17 seconds? 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  I start pulling into the garage or right close to it, and Danny starts yelling,  6'8", 6'8", 6'8".  I'm like, what the hell?  6'8".  What the hell?  And then, again, like the Titanic hitting a freaking iceberg.  Danny, what the hell is 6'8"?  What does that mean?  How many drinks he had?  Yeah, why would you start yelling 6'8", 6'8"? 
[01:08:00]  I understand.  Yeah, in hindsight, apparently it's the clearance, and I'm supposed to know that this van  is, in fact, taller than 6'8".  Than 6'8".  Why doesn't he say, like, a iceberg dead ahead or something?  How about just, stop!  Stop!  Yeah, the word would be stop.  Stop!  Stop.  Because he obviously, in his own life, doesn't understand what that word means.  Yeah, Danny made quite an impression on everybody, I gotta tell ya.  Danny, what if you all stop, but the word has as much meaning to him as something else 
[01:08:30]  does to you or I in French.  So, to make a long story short...  How tall was the van?  About 7', I would say.  6'9", 6'10".  It's the whole top, man.  It's the whole top.  So, you're looking probably about at least 6 inches higher than...  It's gotta be.  Gotta be.  6'8".  So, it was like...  The soundest thing made.  So, you went down into the garage, and you heard the awful screech.  How far...  Did you get the whole van in before you stopped it, or did you like... 
[01:09:00]  It was halfway through or more.  Halfway.  So, now it has to back...  So, what can I do?  We can't continue going forward.  No.  So, I have to find a way out of this pickle, so we back up.  I'll tell you what...  Oh, this is a picture on top of the van.  With a certain happy person with us.  Oh, boy.  I know what you could've done.  Look at the shredded fiberglass.  I can't see it.  Oh, this is up on foundrymusic.com, the picture?  It's kind of hard, the version of the picture we got, but, yeah, there's the damage to Ziggy's van. 
[01:09:30]  This is a beautiful...  Was, is gonna be, again, based on my wallet, unfortunately.  It was a beautiful van.  Why do you have to pay for it?  Because I effed up, which I told...  We talked to Ziggy that night.  I mean, what can you do?  I took the keys.  I said, sure, I'll drive the 400 feet.  Wait a minute.  Here's the thing, too.  When you backed out, you should've...  This is the genius, the Boy Scouts, because there was a truck that got stuck in a tunnel  one time and they couldn't get it out.  Oh, you should've... 
[01:10:00]  It's like the tires.  Oh, did you do that?  No, but it was already so crunched, it wasn't...  Yeah, at that point, it doesn't matter.  How much is it gonna cost?  Who knows?  Probably all my brother's profits.  There were no profits.  Oh, boy.  Man, that 24 hours in Worcester was a rough time for the kid, man.  Took a big loss.  We'll get into the whole bar story.  Got kicked out, got ripped off.  Yeah, we'll get into the bar story in just a bit.  We gotta take our first break, but we're just getting started.  You can see the damage to the van, Ziggy's van, MyRadioStore.com, if you want to buy 
[01:10:30]  a concert t-shirt or some Opie and Anthony t-shirts.  No, go for the higher ticket items.  Ziggy has a whole wide range of stuff.  By the way, Ziggy...  Ziggy's a good boy and he's been great to this show.  Oh, yeah.  All right, we gotta take our first break.  We'll continue.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, this is Roland.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's probably about me.  It's a madhouse.  We gotta calm down, man.  I gotta tell you right now.  The worst.  The worst.  I am the worst. 
[01:11:00]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It is the worst.  The fucking worst of Opie and Anthony.  That's the worst idea I've ever heard in my life.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We're back from our road trip back in New York City.  We did the first ONA traveling virus.  The comedy event of 2006 up there in Worcester over the weekend.  Next stop, PNC Art Center.  Tickets still available through Ticketmaster.com. 
[01:11:30]  All the info is up on OpieandAnthony.com.  All the comedians killed for us.  Oh, yeah.  We don't even know where to begin.  We have so many stories to tell.  I want to hit the phones really fast here.  Let's say hi to Jason in New Jersey.  Jason, what's up?  Hey, boys.  How we doing?  All right, Jason.  It's good to see you guys are on live,  considering the fact that you guys had a real big weekend.  We're kind of tired, to be honest with you.  We all got home late yesterday afternoon.  Well, that's definitely surprising to see all that traffic on Long Island for Anthony.  But anyway, I wanted to thank you, Opie, 
[01:12:00]  because I was actually the last one online.  And everybody was signing stuff.  Rich Voss is an idiot, but everybody was signing stuff.  And you were just overly friendly with me, shaking my hand, saying thank you for coming.  And it was really cool.  It was really nice.  And real quick, I got a dumb picture with Jim Norton.  And Rich Voss had decided to take a cross shot with me and Jimmy,  but it was my last picture.  So it kind of really disappointed me, but no big deal, though.  Oh, that was your picture?  Yeah, that was my picture. 
[01:12:30]  Rich Voss was trying to fool around with me,  and he didn't realize I had one picture left,  and he took a cross shot with me and Jimmy, which is great.  You know, I could show my girlfriend.  She loved it.  That's going to suck.  I mean, we take a lot of pictures,  so from time to time we'll really try to screw up people's pictures,  just to keep it fun for us.  Yeah.  But then you get a story like this.  It was the guy's last picture on his camera.  He wanted a special shot,  and he's looking at his pictures, and he sees a cross shot.  You don't hand it to another comedian.  They're going to try to be funny. 
[01:13:00]  If you want to make sure you get a really good shot of us  or some of our comedy friends, whatever,  make sure you have a friend there that you can trust.  That knows how to work the camera.  Because I hear Danny wrecked all the photos.  We're, like, posing and trying to be nice,  and Danny's behind us just making drunken faces.  Just making Danny faces.  He didn't mean to make drunken faces.  He was just trying to peer in, like, what's going on?  Hey, real quick, got a quick question for you.  How come all the stuff you were signing was dumbrichvoss.com stuff? 
[01:13:30]  I don't know.  It's funny.  Like, you know, we had T-shirts.  Jimmy had merchandise.  Did Bill Burr have merchandise?  Billy had, I think, a CD or something.  And Voss is signing a dumb bumper sticker.  That's all he was.  No, he had his DVD.  Oh, I didn't sign one of those.  But he had, like, a load of these bumper stickers.  Yeah, we signed those.  I know the struggle stickers.  Yeah.  What?  He thought that was going to take off, like, the wow stickers.  Yeah, he thought that was the I don't get no respect of the O's of the millennium. 
[01:14:00]  What's that?  He wants it to be as big as get her done.  Yeah, you think it's going to be get her done.  No one says, I know this.  Hey, I know the struggle.  Me too.  That's Voss' thing, right?  Rich Voss.  No one says it.  A few of our fans, I was signing that thing, and he goes, what does that even mean?  I'm like, I don't know.  I don't know.  It's something to sign.  All right, let's go to James.  It's something Nervous Voss used to say in front of black audiences.  He's like, you know, he'd kill in front of black crowds.  He'd go, I know the struggle, like, what it's like to be black.  Yeah.  And they would all laugh.  Yeah. 
[01:14:30]  All right, James, what's up?  Let's translate to a sticker.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Just wanted to thank you for a great time.  I was down there in Worcester.  Patrice and Bill set the bar unbelievably high.  I thought there had to be a letdown, but there wasn't.  Jimmy, once again, proved to be the funniest man alive.  Love you, kid.  Everybody had really, really good sets up there in Worcester, man.  Yeah, absolutely Jimmy killed.  I loved my set, but I'm very self-critical.  I wish a couple of things had gone better.  I don't like what I opened with, but aside from that, it was great. 
[01:15:00]  All right, let's go to Sonny Ferrelli, one of the pests from the Boston area.  Sonny, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing, man?  I tell you, you guys did a fantastic job, man.  I tell you, I had myself one of the greatest times there, man.  Thank you.  I've lost my voice, too, man.  I don't know why, but, I mean, I wasn't even part of the show, really.  But, geez, you don't think it had something to do with the bar incident before the show started, do you? 
[01:15:30]  Let me tell you how powerful the pests are.  And you never know when they're going to just use their power.  I guess a lot of people were drinking before the show in one of the local gin mills up there in Worcester.  And my brother was at the bar.  Another story with my brother, hence the reason he's here today.  Worst 24 hours ever.  But Sonny made it a little better by getting about 100 pests to leave en masse out the door after the – how do I put this on free FM? 
[01:16:00]  The cunt dripping –  Oh, wow.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I don't think that'll make it through.  The bartender stole my money.  She was stealing other people's money.  Hold on.  I've got to help you out because you think it's cute to use that word, but then no one's understanding what you're saying.  You won't.  Ass.  He's cute.  So everyone's drinking in this bar before the show.  My brother's at the bar.  And what, a bartender was ripping you off or something? 
[01:16:30]  We were there for a while.  I had to go do the merch and all that.  So just kind of sipping some beers there.  And I was buying some drinks for pass.  We ate some food.  So I kept putting 20s down.  And I turned around.  Kara from MySpace was there with Eddie and JJ was there.  So a bunch of the pests.  And we're looking at the Miss Virus contestants on screen.  Oh, we'll get into that in a minute.  We're talking five feet behind me.  So I look at it.  I'm like, all right, cool.  I turn around and my pile of money is like 40, 50 bucks easily.  Gone. 
[01:17:00]  She just took it off the bar.  Who was she?  The bartender?  The bartender.  Oh, boy.  That's a bartending trick, by the way.  When you leave money on the bar, like, you know, you throw your lot down.  Yeah, maybe a five or something like that.  And if you slip away for a while, you take the five.  You don't grab 50 bucks off the bar.  Well, it was a sleazy bitch.  It was a madhouse.  It was a zoo because everyone went to this one bar, especially the O&A Pest.  They all got together.  You know, they kind of travel in groups now.  And my brother's there enjoying himself and notices that all his money from the bar is gone. 
[01:17:30]  I'm five feet away.  I mean, a happy typing girl was hanging with me most of the time in his other past.  She's still there.  And this woman, this chick, this bitter.  Jimmy, if you could take what's in my head and express it as only you can do it.  This silly goose of a gal.  Oh, that's perfect.  I don't mean to get too salty this early.  Easy.  She takes the money, so all I do is I go back.  How about this typical woman?  Oh, there you go.  You know what it is?  It's one of these miserable bartenders that are working at this miserable bar. 
[01:18:00]  And her life is just miserable.  Probably the locals that go in there don't tip her crap.  The sad part, this was going to be a big afternoon for her.  Yeah, this would have been big.  You guys would have tipped her big if she wasn't spiffering off the bar.  How much action does a bar like this in Worcester get on a Saturday afternoon?  Please, the local yokels go in, down a few beers, and might leave loose change on the bar. 
[01:18:30]  What's the name of the bar, do you want to say?  Fair enough.  Irish Times?  The Irish Times.  It got attacked, so that was good.  Did it?  But the chick, all I did was I asked her, I said, hey, carry my money back.  She starts cursing at me.  She draws this invisible line in a bar.  If it's here, it's mine.  Are you kidding me?  Dude, she started making a scene, and as Opie and I know, we grew up in a freaking crazy  household.  You think making a scene with me is going to deter me?  No, not at all.  Are you screaming like a maniac? 
[01:19:00]  If it's here, it's mine?  Exactly.  How about like, it's my money, you dope?  Well, that was kind of my reply.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it got ugly very quickly.  She's screaming and yelling.  How do you fight with a girl?  What am I going to do, go over to the bar and swing at her?  She could scream and yell and do whatever she wants.  Yeah.  Next thing, you know, she has bouncers coming, so I go to-  Oh, you're instantly wrong now.  Yeah.  She's screaming, get the F out, get the F out.  And also, it's the funniest thing.  This guy shrieks somewhere, oh my God, they kicked Brother Elmo out. 
[01:19:30]  And it was kind of like something you would hear.  Wait, did they drag you out?  No.  I went right to these two guys.  Anybody there can attest.  I was right at them.  Like, you know, hey, take a fucking-  Sorry.  Here we go again.  Sorry.  Take a swing at me.  And Sonny Ferrelli started gathering everybody, just making an announcement.  And next thing you know, everybody just starts chanting and just yelling.  And we all leave.  This is the power of the O&A Pest, what he's getting at.  98% of the bar emptied out after my brother got kicked out. 
[01:20:00]  Sonny Ferrelli, you made, like, some huge announcement, like, we're out of here?  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  And this is the funny thing.  The bartender was going to have a killer day.  So for the stupid 40 bucks or whatever she got off my brother, that was it for the day  because the whole place just left the bar.  Yeah, probably would have made a couple of hundred.  You know what made it even worse?  I gave her a $10 tip for a $14 drink tab right before this whole crap happened.  You know?  So the Irish pub, maybe somebody knows the owner there and can call them and just let them know. 
[01:20:30]  That your bartender's a thief.  The fact that, allegedly, your bartender, it looks like she took money from Elmo that she shouldn't have,  and that cost his establishment thousands of dollars.  Easily.  Thousands of dollars.  Now there's about 100 pests outside now after we're all gathered up.  Wait, I want to let that settle in, how beautiful this was.  Sonny Ferrelli makes the announcement, and no one even questioned it.  They're like, all right, we're out of here.  Yeah.  And they all just, like, left their beers half full. 
[01:21:00]  Well, they probably chugged them down.  Yeah, who am I kidding?  Who am I kidding?  You're right.  And whatever was left over, I'm sure Danny was running around and drinking as fast as he could.  He emptied everyone, like a six-year-old at someone's, like, adult party.  He sneaks out of his room.  Wrung out the bar rag in his mouth.  The beauty of Danny, too, because I saw that he was hammered backstage.  I'm like, wow, you seem really drunk.  He's, like, blaming his drinking on the fact that he stopped smoking.  Yeah, we're buying it, Danny. 
[01:21:30]  We're buying that one.  Yeah, no filter.  Paul even left his credit card there.  He left so fast.  Yeah, so they all just filed out.  Anyway, you're outside the establishment.  Go ahead, Sonny.  So, anyways, there's about 100 of us outside the establishment, right?  All of a sudden, I start chanting, you effed up!  You effed up!  You effed up!  You effed up!  And the guy comes out, you know, the provider of the establishment comes out and says,  Oh, sir, I dare you to say that again while I'm out here.  So I turn around and says, all right, you effed up! 
[01:22:00]  You effed up!  And what did he do?  He's just, like, sitting there like a stupid dolt.  So, the Irish pub, is that what they're called?  The Irish Times.  There you go.  Bunch of dopes.  Well, they already lost a lot of business.  They could have had a really nice Saturday afternoon.  Hit them in their pocketbooks.  There you go.  Sonny.  Got them by their purse strings now.  What was your favorite part of the O&A traveling virus?  I'll tell you, everything was so great.  You know, I'll tell you what.  My endorphins were kicking in all night. 
[01:22:30]  You know, by the time the last Tracy Morgan came on, my endorphins were crashing.  But I kind of, but the whole show was just fantastic, man.  It was just great.  Yeah, right on.  We were very, very happy with how it turned out.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, Sonny.  Thank you, Angel.  All right, congratulations, boys.  And have Kenny give me a call as soon as possible, will you?  As soon as possible.  All right, thank you.  Let's go to Dan.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, boys, how's it going?  What's up, Dan?  The show was, if I may steal the word, phenomenal. 
[01:23:00]  Okay.  And then after the show, I got my autograph signed by Opie and got a quick little not-you  line in.  And then I get up to Anthony, and I figured that if I was going to blow in front of my  radio hero for the past four years or so, it was going to be me messing up.  Except Anthony's girlfriend decides to take that moment to point out that I have fuzz on my collared shirt.  Yes.  So the one picture that I get is me, blurred, picking a fuzz off my shirt, embarrassed in  front of my idol.  He's picking fuzz off his shirt, and he's all blurry. 
[01:23:30]  Why do you idolize Anthony's girlfriend?  And why do you care about the fuzz on your shirt, you creep?  Click.  I was going to call him a creep and a clear, because I called him a creep.  Dan, what was your favorite part of the show?  My favorite part was when I walked over and asked Pat from Minaki to wipe my shirt on  his forehead, and Danny decided to one-up him by sticking it down the front of his pants  and caressing his junk.  Of course Danny did.  God, where's Danny?  He's hiding today.  Where is Danny, man?  He always thinks it's a good idea, and then the next day he hides. 
[01:24:00]  Let's go to Dan in Massachusetts.  Denial.  Dan?  Hey, boys.  It's Phillip Eaton Cox.  That's with a hyphen.  Hey, what's up?  I just wanted to thank you guys for the...  That joke was awful, and they dumped out.  What's up, Dan?  You guys are awesome, man.  I've been listening to this since 1995.  I've been hooked to the virus all these years.  Jimmy Norton, you are by far the funniest stand-up comic I've ever seen.  Thank you, mister.  And you are the best part of the Opie and Anthony show, the new part of the Opie and Anthony 
[01:24:30]  show, man.  Oh.  Oh.  Challenging words.  Challenging observation, Randall.  Yeah, a lot of people don't know the Opie and Anthony show back on WAF was a lot different  than any other show they've done in the past.  I want audio of that show.  I want audio.  I've heard three of Anthony's lines, and I'm obsessed with hearing them.  Oh, no.  That was BAB.  Yeah.  I got good after that, my friend. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, we did some good stuff on AF.  It was the BAB tapes you want.  We were talking about that on the way home.  Oh, yeah.  I hear Anthony's older stuff.  It was horrific.  You were so happy.  Yeah, we'll get to it.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Yeah.  Really?  I know.  Just happy to be there.  Blubbering idiot.  Thank you, buddy.  Jimmy, I've got over 72 hours of the WAF stuff on tape, so if you want it, I'll send it  to you.  Thank you.  If you have any friends with Buckley, please, have it immediately shipped here.  I wasn't listening at that time. 
[01:25:30]  All right, Dan, what else do you want to say?  We've got to move on.  We've got a lot of people trying to check in today.  Yeah, you guys are...  I just wanted to say, Jimmy was the best comic of the night.  I just wanted to thank him.  You guys are hilarious.  Your little video thing you did was absolutely hilarious.  Thank you for the good time, man.  All right.  This would be a good time to mention the video we decided to make backstage.  I got a copy of it, but it's clipping, so Steve's back at XM trying to fix it so we  could get it online immediately.  It's clipping. 
[01:26:00]  But I came up with this idea, and I didn't really have an ending to it, and then Jimmy  came up with just an amazing ending to my little video.  Oh, he certainly did.  My little video comedy piece.  Because they didn't want us to appear until, like, halfway through the show.  They wanted the show to build, and then eventually Ed and I made our appearance, and our bits  sucked, and we'll get into the reason why it sucked in a little while here.  It's more of a segment.  Our segment.  Yeah.  Well, we had a bunch of things we were doing during the show, but we were bored. 
[01:26:30]  So we're like, why don't we at least, like, you know, film a video piece, and we'll play  that.  A vignette.  Yeah, there you go.  A vignette.  And they could go, you know, a la WWE type thing where they take us back and show what's  going on in the dressing room.  Right.  That's what they did.  So we had a couple concepts, and we don't want to blow the other concepts because we might  still film them.  Oh, we will.  We might film them, though.  There's a couple that are really, really funny if we could pull them off.  So we go with this one concept that, you know, Voss goes on stage. 
[01:27:00]  This was one of the only production F-ups, by the way, in the whole show.  Voss was supposed to go on stage in between some of the comics and, you know, say that  there's something wrong, you know, backstage.  Something is going on.  There's a commotion.  Like Anthony said, like WWE style, right?  Yeah.  So Voss is like, he's supposed to go, let's go backstage and see what's going on.  And at that point, you see Anthony on a cell phone. 
[01:27:30]  But it wasn't queued up right.  It didn't work.  And then it was just audio and no video.  It's a little glitch.  A little glitch.  It was worth it just to see Voss's acting.  What?  What?  We got a problem?  What?  What?  And he actually pokes his head back and looks like he's a method actor?  Yeah.  What?  What problem?  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Backstage, I'm trying to get him psyched up and tell him, this is all you need to do.  And he was in panic mode because he had to improvise.  I'm like, it's so easy.  Make believe, like, someone's talking in your ear, like, what? 
[01:28:00]  There's a problem?  What?  What's going on?  I need a script.  Wait, wait, wait.  He's on the phone with the promoter.  What?  What?  Let's check it out.  Watch.  Right, right.  It was so awful over the top.  And all he was supposed to say was something like, yeah, there's a problem.  You know, obviously you haven't seen Opie and Anthony yet.  There seems to be a problem backstage.  Let's go backstage and see what the heck is going on.  That's all he really had to do.  Yeah.  And then the tape screwed up.  So that put him in panic mode where he's like, ah, ah, ah, ah.  But we finally get the tape on and we got two really, really over the top laughs. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  And you guys didn't even really hear the dialogue because the laughing drowned out what was being said.  And incidentally, I have a quick suggestion for Steve.  If the dialogue is, if the sound is messed up, because apparently there's some kind of a ticking on our version of it, transcribe it and put subtitles on Foundry because people can read it because it's very easy to know exactly what we're saying.  Well, Kenny's going to make sure we get another copy because this videotape has to be seen.  Yeah.  So finally the videotape is shown.  And if you weren't at the show, this is what you're going to see. 
[01:29:00]  And we're going to do different ones for other shows, by the way.  The shows can be a little different.  Every city we go to, by the way, the comedians get a little different.  Some of the things we do in between the comedians a little different.  So we're not really blowing anything.  This video will be up on opianathony.com for you to check out.  So Anthony's on the phone.  Why don't you take it from there, Anthony?  I just say that there's a problem with Opie.  Yeah.  There's a problem.  I don't know what it is.  He's never been like this before.  He's acting very unprofessionally.  And I can't seem to talk to him. 
[01:29:30]  And then we walk over to him.  You were like, you know, I've had it.  Yeah.  He does this type of thing all the time.  Yeah.  And, you know, we have to go out there.  And you're obviously on the phone with the promoter.  Yeah, with somebody of importance.  Sure.  And go over to the...  Your acting was wonderful, by the way.  Thank you.  It really was.  Academy Award winner.  I really believed you were actually talking to somebody.  I am.  How did you get a promoter on the phone to play this off so quickly?  I am very good.  I imagine that there was someone on the other side. 
[01:30:00]  In Hollywood, they usually have someone on the other side.  So you can play along nice.  Don't even need it.  You don't even need it.  You didn't need it.  I took a little pause where the guy was talking and I was listening.  I did a great job.  It was as good of fake phone conversations I've ever seen.  Like, if you didn't know, you'd think he was...  He talks on the phone.  You'd think it was the real person he was talking to.  Well, believe me, I was just the straight man set up thing for this.  You're sitting on the couch, you're doing wine, you're talking to the promoter, there's  a problem, he does this, and it's annoying. 
[01:30:30]  Legs crossed.  Apparently, you're on the phone like Truman Capote when you're on the phone, maybe sick.  Why won't he come out?  So then you're like, all right, I'll go see what's going on.  So you get up and the cameraman follows you over to a big shower.  Right.  But there's a curtain in front of the shower.  So you open up the huge curtain that leads you into this huge shower room.  Yes.  And there we reveal Opie sort of curled up in the fetal position, but standing on his feet,  but curled up, grabbing your ankles, squatting. 
[01:31:00]  It's kind of like, you know, the girl in the shower after she's been raped.  Right.  Looking like that.  And you look at the camera kind of, and then look away and look at it again, shouting, go  away, go away.  No, go away.  Leave me alone, no.  Putting his hand up defensively.  Shaking.  Shaking.  In his underpants.  And you're in your underpants, by the way.  And that's how the bit was going to end, and I'm thinking, we need an ending.  It got that right there. 
[01:31:30]  Got a huge laugh.  Yeah.  Got a huge laugh from the crowd watching it on the big screen.  But we're like, we really need an ending.  So then Jimmy came to the rescue.  So there's the shot.  And then from...  And then it was just going to go black and big laugh, next comedian.  But anyway, go ahead.  From off camera, walking into frame towards Opie is a completely, and I mean completely,  not a stitch of clothing, completely nude Jim Norton, walking towards Opie. 
[01:32:00]  He stops.  My hands are on my hips.  Yeah.  Kimbo.  Your hands on your hips, completely naked.  From the back, we see Jimmy.  You turn around a little bit, and you're yelling something at Opie.  I forget.  I said something about stop your crying.  Stop your crying.  Take it like a man kind of a thing.  And then he turns, looks into the camera, and says, no homo, and starts walking towards 
[01:32:30]  Opie as it goes, fades to black.  But it got a really nice laugh, and you couldn't hear the noise.  A nice laugh.  This is what I'm trying to say.  I got a pretty good laugh.  I got a really good laugh.  I was pretty psyched.  And then when Jimmy appeared, any laugh I got, forget about it.  It was screams.  It was thrown away.  They screamed.  They started screaming, laughing at the same time.  And then the screen goes black, and then there's Voss trying to improv his way to the  next movie. 
[01:33:00]  Ah, boy.  I guess they, I guess they, I hope they work that out.  I don't know.  Wow.  What's going to happen?  Wow.  Wow.  Does a spit take?  Right.  Gleason was better when Mr. Marshall walked into the office.  Voss was trying to act like there was a problem.  We're trying to get the audio, just so you could hear the audio portion of it.  Um, and by the way, we had to do two takes.  Yeah, that's what I wanted to get into.  Yeah.  I was really hurt.  Um, because I, I, I walked in and I got to be honest and I'm, I'm kind of glad this 
[01:33:30]  happened, but I was nude and I wasn't going to show frontal nudity, obviously.  Why?  No.  The whole crowd all lathered up.  Right.  Just from the back.  And then as you started turning toward the camera, the cameraman kind of comes up on  you a little bit.  Yeah.  So he cuts out all the nasty bits.  But you got to remember, I'm like, I'm, I'm on, you know, my knees and my elbows in the  corner and I have to look up towards Jimmy.  Yeah.  And you, because you know, this is supposed to be from your eyes, the videotape, right? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  What?  I don't know.  It looked like cartoon us on channel five.  All right.  So, uh, we got distracted.  We get distracted very easy on the show.  Pretty colors.  So it was, it was my time to, to turn toward Jimmy.  Yeah.  And as I turned toward Jimmy, because I'm so low and you're now you're seeing the part  the camera isn't seeing, you're seeing frontal nudity of Jimmy.  I look up and I look at Jimmy completely nude and not a, well, let's make the air, not a 
[01:34:30]  hair on him.  Yeah.  All right.  Nothing going on.  Yeah.  Well, in more ways than one.  I said that, uh, thank God, thank God, by the way, not, not a hint of a hair.  Yeah.  He looked like a, an overgrown baby.  I started laughing so hard and then I hear the cameraman and the director cause they're  panicking.  They want to get this on the show within minutes.  Yeah.  I started laughing my ass off.  The scene I saw was hilarious.  And, and all I hear is, ah, you laughed. 
[01:35:00]  You wrecked the whole take.  They're getting all mad.  I'm like, you, you have to see what I just saw.  Let me tell you something.  It was almost like ice water had been splashed on my back.  Yeah.  I looked like a fleshy colored inner tube.  That, you know, a little piece that sticks out for the air.  Right.  To be blown into.  Little thing you put the air in.  I was envious of that.  I have never been packing so little in my life.  Yeah.  And I obviously was grateful.  Had I known in advance though, that that was going to happen.  And believe me, I would have taken a pill just to make you uncomfortable. 
[01:35:30]  Don't worry.  I was already uncomfortable.  Yeah.  That was pretty uncomfortable.  That was my first nude scene.  Trust me.  Mine too.  And my, and my last.  Well, you were in your underpants.  Hey, that's his new, that's my nude scene right there.  That doesn't get any better than that.  Yeah.  The only nudity you'll ever have.  So.  My cheeks look pretty good though.  I got to say.  We're trying to get the audio on before we take a break here.  Hey, the video is up on opianthony.com.  The video has made its way to opianthony.com.  Could someone make sure this video gets to YouTube as well? 
[01:36:00]  And make sure that there's no full frontal for me, even a glimpse.  Neither would it be without the Hubble.  Believe me.  I don't know.  I checked.  I checked.  I thought when you turned around at one point before the camera came up, I was checking on  that.  And no, I think you're safe.  I think so too.  I don't want people just thinking that's me.  Believe me.  If it was a little warmer in there and I was a little more comfortable, I would have turned  around and waved to the crowd.  Maybe if somebody else was in the corner.  Like you.  Well.  I'm not a blonde guy.  I go for brown haired men. 
[01:36:30]  Like the brunettes.  Oh, it was awful.  All right.  They're cleaning up the audio because there's a few beeps, but the video is up on opianthony.com  and we need it to be added to YouTube.  I think this video is going to be seen by a lot of people.  Oh, yeah.  So it was one of the vignettes we did.  It was a lot of fun.  All right.  And the comics, I didn't see a lot of the sets.  I heard Patrice destroyed.  Yep.  Bob Kelly destroyed.  No, Bob always kills that big.  Everyone though.  I mean, because I was asking Jimmy on the way home because I mean, we were too busy trying  to get things going backstage. 
[01:37:00]  So I try to watch about five minutes of every guy.  And what I saw was everyone was killing.  And I asked Jimmy on the way home besides you because I didn't want to put him in a bad  spot.  I'm like, who else killed?  And we honestly couldn't really.  Everyone killed is what the answer is.  I guess what I'm trying to say here.  Yeah.  And yeah, it was it was I saw part of Saget said he was just murdering.  He completely had the crowd.  Yeah.  And I mean, if one of my friends bombed, believe me, we're not being dishonest.  There's nothing I would like more than to throw one of these dopes under the bus and tell 
[01:37:30]  you how they died.  Boss killed as a host.  I mean, he always like, I'll host it.  But he is just the best host.  I mean, he just kills through the entire show.  It was great, man.  Right.  Oh, there's Tracy Morgan in a tough spot, too, going on last.  Yep.  And and, you know, all the topics have been covered and stepped on and squashed.  And he still pulled it out and did a great job.  Well, Tracy supposedly got kicked out of the hotel.  We'll get into that story.  We got to get into the Twitchell story.  And there's there's Opie in the corner and Jimmy. 
[01:38:00]  You really your face.  You really look pain, man.  I told you I'm an actor shot.  Oh, my dear, sweet Lord.  Way to put the Foundry music logo over my cheeks, stupid.  Does the Foundry logo have to be over the punchline of the joke?  Take the Foundry music logo off if you could.  Oh, my God.  Could you put it in a corner somewhere like a TV station does?  Why is the Foundry music logo?  Steve, you had nothing to do with this video.  Give us a break every once in a while.  It's completely over the punchline, which is Jimmy's butt. 
[01:38:30]  Steve didn't film this.  Steve wasn't even there.  He had a flat tire.  In fairness, I will say, what, someone stepped on his shoe?  I will say, in fairness, it's probably just a standard thing they do.  Why are you freaking?  You had nothing to do with this video.  Look at that.  The Foundry music.  Look at where the logo is.  You told me to put the traveling virus thing on there.  Yes, that is fine.  And maybe for once write opianthony.com instead of Foundry music.  You had nothing to do with this.  But look, it's covering up the joke, which is the fact that Jimmy. 
[01:39:00]  I challenge you to have a laugh while everyone else is filling up looking at that.  I didn't mean that.  I meant the punchline of the.  Jimmy, now that the video is paused.  Didn't yet.  What the F is going on at the top of your crack?  Let me see.  Where?  The top of the crack.  There seems to be a.  Because.  You know, maybe you should have, you know.  Oh.  That area.  No, no, no.  Never.  Please.  No?  I'm immaculate.  I shower.  All right.  Please.  All right.  Picture eating a fresh cantaloupe. 
[01:39:30]  Oh.  Cool and refreshing.  And delicious, if I may.  Well, the video's up.  Can we get it on YouTube as well?  While Eric eats cantaloupe out of his stupid fruit dish.  There's the foundrymusic.com website there.  Yeah.  Just.  And whoever put together those Foundry videos, I was not even in them at all.  Could I have been in them a little bit more?  I mean.  A little bit.  I know.  A little bit.  Well, we're going to.  What the hell?  We're going to definitely tweak.  Heck.  But you're right. 
[01:40:00]  One of the things we're going to have to tweak for the next one at the PNC Arts Center.  Here's the audio of the bit.  But the bit is now up on opianathlete.com.  You've got to see the video.  And that's just like they put in the website.  This is a standard thing they do.  It all, you know, it just goes up there in the window probably.  So.  That annoys me though.  That the logo.  It reminds me of television, especially now.  They put the logo of the station in the corner.  And now they run promos that like are movies on the bottom of the screen.  You're trying to watch a movie and a car comes over.  There's sound effects to it now. 
[01:40:30]  All right.  Stop with the commercials for your shows.  Trying to watch this.  Yeah.  Sometimes you got to.  And I've seen other websites, porn websites that do it.  It's just, it just probably like, it's almost like a template, I guess.  You know, this is where it goes on the screen and the template shown.  And you have to make a concept.  Oh my God.  Let me move the logo to the side.  Yeah.  So it's not.  Oh, annoying.  I'm not trying to brag.  Yes.  But when you see my, my, my ass, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's lovely.  It's lovely.  I talked to my call.  I'm like, how fast would I be attacked in jail?  And I, and I knew that's why I behaved. 
[01:41:00]  That ass is the reason I pay my taxes.  That's why I pay taxes.  All right.  Listen, here's the audio clips a little bit at the end because we got a bad copy.  But the video that you're now looking at on opianthony.com is fine.  That's my acting.  Here's the audio.  People saying I was a little over the top with my acting.  It's good.  You, you're supposed to be, you were cowering about to be raped.  Silly goose.  He won't come out.  It's completely unprofessional.  I've never seen him like this before.  That's not great acting.  Three times.  I've tried one more and this is it. 
[01:41:30]  Cause I can't go out there by myself.  There's a problem.  I don't know.  Never seen him in a state like this.  Opie, we got a show to do.  We got.  No way.  I said, go away, please.  Just go away.  Go away.  Something happened.  Go away.  I don't know what the fuck it is.  Go away.  Stop your crying. 
[01:42:00]  No homo.  All right.  Well, you know what?  There was a curse in there.  Good job.  Who got the job of believing that?  We need, of course, to blame somebody.  It's what we do on this show.  It's a blame game.  Who did it?  Forget it.  Sam.  Did you?  Sam.  No, I'm not going to forget it.  I'm not.  The only way these people learn is by discipline.  This has to be run like a pirate ship.  That's right.  I wasn't cursing.  I said pirate ship.  Get in here and get your mouth kissed.  Where is that girl? 
[01:42:30]  Well, we got to take a break.  That's why I said pirate ship.  Can we beat him up after the break?  How do you miss it?  Sam, you missed an F.  It's an F word.  How do you miss an F word?  Which messed up the audio playback there.  You didn't listen to it.  Is the whole word in there?  The whole word.  No, just the F.  That's why we don't like the letter F.  The whole word comes through loud and clear.  I'm trying to grow a mustache.  It doesn't matter where it is.  Just take your beating.  You did not listen to the entire thing enough where you missed an F word. 
[01:43:00]  Yep.  Didn't realize.  I'm sorry.  Of course.  Shame on you.  Oh, that had a...  Hey, there you go.  Kenny slapped Sam's hand, and we can't tell.  It's almost like a purple now, not red.  Kenny, can you stop tucking in your creepy shirts?  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  We beat up Kenny pretty bad on the way home.  It was a lot of fun, actually.  What a maniac.  And I got it.  By the way, nobody wants to hug Ope's brother, especially Ziggy, but more than I do.  Why? 
[01:43:30]  Because Club Soda Kenny is normally extremely...  Oh, we're so late.  Let's talk about when we get back.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Here's a big teaser.  Because that's another 10 minutes, I'm telling you.  Oh, here's a teaser.  Here's a teaser.  Of the Ope and Anthony Show.  Sucker Patty.  What's up, Patty?  Hey, how are you?  Yeah, I heard you were talking about the travel and virus.  I had a great time over the weekend, and thank you for putting me there and everything.  We had no choice, Patty.  Your accommodations.  You liked the hotel, huh? 
[01:44:00]  It was really nice.  I was fascinated by the coffee pot in the room, and knowing me and coffee, I was so happy  with that.  Oh, my God.  I never saw a coffee pot in a hotel room before.  Never.  But then again, I've not seen too many hotel rooms, either.  You know.  Love to break into a room and hit her over the head with a coffee pot.  Just bludgeoned.  She's found bludgeoned by a coffee pot.  Patty, everyone wants to know if you got some ass.  Yep.  On Saturday night.  Some action.  I got the what? 
[01:44:30]  Of course.  Why would she know?  Did you have sex?  Action.  Did you get any action with your male friend?  Yeah, you were having breakfast with this male friend of yours.  Oh, I just met him on the Sunday morning yesterday.  He was eating breakfast, and I was getting mine.  And he came over and says, hi, may I buy you breakfast, Patty?  I looked at him, and we just met.  And I think his name is George.  You know, he's a retired guy, and he was traveling, and he's making two of the shows.  Retired guy traveling. 
[01:45:00]  And this guy was desperate.  This guy's just looking for tail.  He's like, all right, let me look around down here.  Oh, crap.  Well, it's worth a shot, I guess.  Well, it's her or a poached egg.  Right.  It was nice making a new friend, and I really enjoyed his company.  And when he comes to me, he's like, I'm going to work.  She just babbles and babbles and babbles.  Kenny and I were having, like I said, breakfast in one of the booths.  And by the time I got down, we could hear Patty across the entire restaurant.  And there were a bunch of people now sitting because everyone started coming down together, I guess. 
[01:45:30]  And all you could hear is Patty's just voice that goes right through you.  And I didn't know he bought you breakfast.  I want my 20 bucks back.  Yeah, because Stark and Patty's sitting there enjoying the buffet.  Yeah.  And she's crying poverty to Kenny every chance she gets.  She needs money for the bus ride.  Yeah.  So, and the buffet was like, yeah, yeah.  But, but she, she needed money for the bus ride.  And then she said she only had $4. 
[01:46:00]  No, $11 to her name.  I said, you got money to go home?  Oh, I did, yeah.  She goes, I only got $11 to my name.  So how are you going to pay for the buffet, Patty?  Which was, I believe, $19?  $19.  So how did you expect to pay for that?  Oh, I was, before I went inside, I was sitting in the chair and Kenny came over to me and, you know, he gave me back my car fare for the bus.  So, uh, I was able to use that, but then I didn't have to because, uh, he treated me. 
[01:46:30]  And then I used it for lunch instead because I didn't have any food at home yet.  So I figured I'd eat a real food at home.  Oh, there's always a story.  Shut up.  And don't have to worry about it.  Every time you talk to her, you, you know, I will, I refuse to feel sorry for you, Patty.  You're pathetic and I love it.  I love it.  So why were you wearing the guy's shirt?  Because I was cold and shivering.  So he was nice enough to go out to his car and get his extra shirt.  She was cold and shivering. 
[01:47:00]  I gave her my shirt, placed them over her quaking shoulders.  It's air conditioning.  It's too cold sometimes.  All right, Patty.  There's more to the story, but we got to cut you off.  We got a big Hollywood star.  Yeah.  I don't know you anymore.  Okay.  What was your favorite?  Oh, you respect that?  Thanks, Patty.  I appreciate it.  You respect that.  Do you?  Yes, I do.  You dope.  I'm not a dope.  Okay.  Well, anyway.  We're going to get into that maybe tomorrow. 
[01:47:30]  I mean, some of these side characters getting a little, a little too big for their britches.  Yeah.  I mean, we haven't even talked about Twitchell's breaking down and crying and spending the whole  night in his room instead of at the ONA traveling virus.  He lost his mind.  And was crying in front of Anthony.  I saw it.  That's one of many stories we still have to tell.  But, Stalker Patty, you respect the fact that we have to go to a Hollywood star instead  of talk to you some more, right?  That's awesome.  That's awesome.  All right, Patty.  All right.  What was your favorite part, by the way? 
[01:48:00]  Oh, I had a great time and I'm looking forward to it.  What was your favorite part of the ONA traveling virus in Worcester, Massachusetts?  Oh, being in the pet thing there and forgetting to throw a little hay back at Paul.  Die!  Back at Paul.  How you doing?  This is Club Soda Kenny.  And you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony, which ain't that bad. 
[01:48:30]  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Did I just fart?  Bringing people right around.  This is especially for the rest of America.  Wake up with Whoopi in the morning.  What?  I nodded off when you said the title.  What?  What station is running her?  WKTU?  Didn't they learn from Free FM's mistake of having David Lee Roth? 
[01:49:00]  Weren't they paying attention?  Jesus.  Celebrities cannot do radio.  Whoopi Lee Roth.  It's very rare.  Celebrities cannot do radio.  Very rare can a celebrity do radio.  They have to have a lot of personnel.  I'll tell you one guy that can do it.  Because they don't have the work ethic.  Danny Bonaduce.  That guy was able to at least do radio because he's energetic.  But he wasn't a celebrity.  He was on TV for a few years.  A part of his family.  But he was 10. 
[01:49:30]  When he was a kid.  But he didn't have radio experience, kind of.  He kind of got thrown into it.  I'm talking A-list, B-list celebrities.  When you get down to the C and the D-list celebrities, you know, they don't have many choices.  But someone like Whoopi, he could easily do radio.  There you go.  He could easily do radio.  He's not a real celebrity.  Well, he's going to talk about what a train wreck his life is, too.  And most celebrities aren't willing to do that.  That's true.  Yeah.  Right.  He's just got that crappy voice and everything.  And he's pretty good.  I'm talking more like David Lee Roth and Whoopi Goldberg. 
[01:50:00]  And there's a whole list of other, you know, big celebrities that have tried radio.  And they just can't get it done.  They can do it for like two, three weeks.  And then they realize, holy crap, I have nothing else to talk about.  And it's a lot of work.  And it's a lot of work.  And I don't feel like working hard at anything, especially radio.  I don't feel like getting up at four in the morning to do this.  It's going to be used to have a lot of downtime.  Right.  It's going to be another disaster.  How is Whoopi going to fit in any of the celebrity shindigs in the evening when she's got to 
[01:50:30]  wake up at an ungodly hour to do morning radio?  And it's another dopey radio station that just says, no, all you have to do is show up.  We got a radio guy in there.  All you have to do is show up, turn the mic on, and just ride it out with them.  Yeah, that's it.  That's all you got to do.  It's easy.  You guys want to hear some Whoopi in the morning?  All right.  Here we go.  Here was their big promo that was stating that Whoopi was coming to town.  Right.  Philly, you're so lucky you don't have to listen to this drivel. 
[01:51:00]  They do on our show, though, now.  Well, yeah.  We share.  Oh, we want to share with the rest of America how awful this is.  So this was the teaser promo, okay?  You know, when a radio station changes or they're bringing in a new personality, they  got to build the excitement.  The excitement must build.  This is how they were building the excitement for Whoopi coming to town.  How excited am I that we are in KTU?  I love this station.  I love it.  It's the premier dance station in the country, man.  We are building a new morning show. 
[01:51:30]  That's right.  You and me, baby.  You and me.  Pass me that jackhammer.  That's it?  Is that it, really?  It could have just been it.  Is that real?  The end.  No, no.  No?  Yeah, that's it.  Pass me that jackhammer because they're building.  No, it didn't crap out.  That's it.  All right.  That's it.  That's it.  That's it.  They sound very excited. 
[01:52:00]  They're building a new station or a new show, so hand me that jackhammer.  They love the station, building a new morning show with a jackhammer.  All right.  Here's some more audio of Whoopi in the Morning here in New York City.  Good morning, everybody who is within the sound of my voice.  Woo!  It took a while to get here.  It took a while to get here and to get up and running.  Now, Cubby, they heard you before they knew it was you, so say good morning to the nice people.  Well, it's a pleasure to be a part of this show. 
[01:52:30]  Paul Cubby Bryant, you might have heard my name, probably not on the level as Whoopi Goldberg.  You're kind of like a worldwide superstar, but I've been in New York radio almost 10 years,  and wow, we are on the radio.  We've been talking about this for how long?  For about 17 minutes.  And the last 17 minutes have been sort of countdown, and it's like, what's going to happen?  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, all right.  You want to cut a root for her a little bit.  Yeah, a little, like, even as a competitor, you know, which I don't really consider a competitor. 
[01:53:00]  This is just another show that's not, I doubt we're going to be sharing much of an audience.  Nah, she's going to be talking to the shwoogies.  Jesus Christ.  But Cubby sounds like I sounded on Opie's old B.A.B. show, just laughing at everything and happy to be there.  Yeah, just a little over-enthusiastic.  A little over-enthusiastic that he's there with the whoopster, if I may call her the whoopster.  I'm hoping he does that. 
[01:53:30]  But he just sounds a little too happy to be there, and I know there's a clip coming up where he almost comes off like a step-and-fetch-it, like he's like a punching bag.  I think this is the clip right here.  Whoopi has no buttons to push.  More terrific audio from their show this morning.  I have to tell you all who are listening, there's all kinds of things that could happen this morning.  Things could just go drop out.  You don't know what's going to happen.  Because it's our first day. 
[01:54:00]  Do you know how many wrong buttons I'm going to hit?  I hope not very many after you bragged about being so famous in New York for being on the radio.  I never know.  If you do that, if you drop the thing, see, they're going to expect me to make the mistakes.  You cannot make any mistakes because now we already know about you.  Little do they know, though, you have no buttons in front of you.  All you've got to worry about is talking.  I do not need a button in front of me.  I don't need anything that I can get in trouble with in front of me.  See, that's exactly what we're saying.  Yeah.  The management of KTU said, look, all you have to do is show up. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, you don't have to show up.  You just show up.  When's the show on?  You just show up like five minutes before showtime, enough to sit down, and then you leave right afterwards.  Everyone else will take care of everything.  You just got to talk.  We'll just talk about your life experiences.  People are going to want to talk to you.  They're going to call you up and ask you things.  Okay, that's week one.  Now what?  Talk about being in the movies.  Oh, and for anybody thinking, well, how do you know? 
[01:55:00]  Because we've just seen it too many times.  We just saw it with David Lee Roth.  The guys in the NAM.  The soldiers that were in the NAM doing their second tour.  You think when those newbies, that fresh meat came off the planes, they didn't look at them and know exactly what was going to happen to each and every one of them?  Of course they did.  When you're in the trenches.  We've seen it before.  That's why we know.  Someone is saying on the instant feedback, what virus is whoopee spreading?  Sickle cell? 
[01:55:30]  Oh, you see?  I didn't say it.  Look.  Or they came up with the other one that, thank God, I don't need to know about.  Where is it?  What is that?  I might even pronounce it wrong because I don't know.  Might.  Tay-Sachs?  Never heard of it.  Tay-Sachs?  Tie-Sachs?  The hell is that?  I don't know.  Someone that's...  Sure it's not a joke?  Someone that's up on their black diseases.  It's T-A-Y-S-A-C-H-S. 
[01:56:00]  Let's look that up.  All right.  Here we go.  More audio from Whoopee in the Morning.  One of the things that I want to talk about right now is the fact that it is the coolest  day of the year today at a high of 90.  Yeah, I know.  I don't understand.  But tomorrow and Wednesday, temperatures near 100, and then you add the humidity, it's  going to feel like 110.  Is that bad?  That's not good.  You know, look.  All you have to do is stay cool.  Now, do you know things to use and take care of yourself like that? 
[01:56:30]  Because you are very...  I won't say very pale, but people can't see you, but you are definitely of a hue that  needs some, you know, protection.  Right.  Meanwhile, she's walking around the station with a basket on her head.  Why are they going to be playing that stupid music underneath everything?  That's awful and distracting.  That's just, you know, to jazz it up.  Do they play music?  I don't know.  Yeah?  Yeah?  There's a little bit of talking. 
[01:57:00]  A fan.  Yeah, it's like, it sounds like they talk maybe 10 minutes per hour, 10 to 15 minutes  per hour.  Man.  And they were giving, like...  Remember those days?  They were giving heat tips and all that crap, so...  Yeah, heat tips.  That's...  And here's some sunscreen talk from Whoopi in the Morning.  All right.  Does it have, like, a new sunscreen that's, like, 100 proof or something like that?  It's an amazing sunscreen.  Even I will use the sunscreen.  Whoopi Goldberg will use it.  I will use the sunscreen because, you know, the truth of the matter is the sun really will 
[01:57:30]  wear you down.  And this is a great sunscreen.  Sunscreen.  You see what's happening, y'all?  My new teeth, I got them just for the radio.  They are loose.  And they are moving around in my mouth.  And I'm not sure if I'm going to keep them...  Hold on a second.  Hold on.  That's pretty hot the way you do that, the way you adjust them.  Holy crap.  Granted, it's their first show.  Granted.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You always got to maybe give the benefit of the doubt when it's... 
[01:58:00]  But she's too big of a star for them to be doing a lot of practice shows.  And she's too big of a star for her to actually hang out with Cubby.  Yeah.  This is just going to fall flat on its face.  I've heard funnier eulogies.  Yeah, Cubby's going to call her at home.  Hey, we got to do a little show prep.  Yeah, screw that.  I got to call Ted Danson.  She's not going to have the time or the energy to get this show going.  No.  Good luck.  I would like to predict four weeks, but they're going to commit to it for a while. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, they got to give them some time.  By the end of the year, goodbye.  Goodbye to Whoopi in the Morning.  And this, it's the kiss of death when Ovi gives it.  I've seen it before.  Kiss of death.  How much time do you give?  Well, I don't think it should be on more than a month.  Yeah.  But, you know, they probably committed.  So probably the end of the year, unfortunately.  Probably right around Christmas would be a good time when everyone's too busy, you know, 
[01:59:00]  Christmas shopping to worry about their favorite radio show.  I would love to say four weeks, dude.  I would love to, but no way.  No way.  Too much invested.  Well, it's Manners Monday on the Whoopi in the Morning show.  So I'm just going to salute those guys, guys and gals, actually, who ride around,  who take care of us in the emergency services.  I think they're terrific.  When I see them, I'm going to wave to them.  That's awesome.  So there wasn't an emergency going on. 
[01:59:30]  They just helped her out.  No, they just helped.  That's cool.  They just helped for no reason.  And that's the one thing we want to really, you know, talk about how this show is going to be.  This show is all about good things.  Talking about stuff like that.  Talking about man.  I did it.  This show is going to be about talking about good things.  You're finished.  Good things.  That's what people want to hear.  People want good things.  It's Smile Tuesday, everybody.  Make sure you smile at your fellow New Yorker today. 
[02:00:00]  Don't forget.  Stupid music is so distracting.  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Stuff like that.  Talking about man.  Can we make today Manners Monday?  Today is already Manners Monday, but you know that you have the sheet in front of you.  What are you talking about?  I was trying to act like I just thought of it.  You are so funny.  Hey, listen.  Y'all need to call us at 1-800-449-8686.  Uh-oh.  Cindy has got your first look at traffic next on KTU. 
[02:00:30]  We're here.  1-035.  She did not just give out the phone number to the O&A pass, did she?  No.  1-800-449-8686.  Oh, did that just happen?  Why don't you welcome Whoopi to New York Radio.  Give her a little welcome.  I'm sure she'd love to hear from the likes of Ramon or a few other characters.  We've got someone from Yellowstone on the phone.  Right.  Frank the Frowner perhaps might want to get through.  There's so many people. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Here's the first caller to the Whoopi in the Morning show.  The first call I want to talk to is Danny from PA.  What line is he on?  He's on line one.  Line number one.  That's why he's the first call.  Danny, are you there?  Hello.  Good morning.  Good morning, Danny.  Whoopi is a pleasure to speak to you, Whoopi.  Thank you, honey.  You know you are our very first caller.  Well, you should go into our caller Hall of Fame.  That's going to last. 
[02:01:30]  That's great to know.  It's a two-hour drive for you.  Are you coming in or going out of the city?  I'm coming into the city.  I actually moved to the Poconos about six years ago.  Excellent.  And I've been doing this commute for the last six years.  And I've always been trying to get into the station.  And today is a pleasure that I'm getting to the station.  Shut up!  Excellent.  Well, I'll tell you, we are thrilled that you called us up.  Shut up.  We want to tell you that we're going to be here every morning today.  We're going to help you with that ride.  We're going to be telling you good stuff.  And we're going to be giving you a big hug on your way in. 
[02:02:00]  Big hug.  But we have nothing for you for being the first caller.  That's right.  I'm sorry.  Shut up!  Huge gratitude.  But you got to talk to Whoopi Goldberg.  How cool is that?  Holy crap.  This is going to be a disaster.  Oh, that woman.  Got a mouth like an outboard motor.  All the time.  What a stupid beat that keeps playing. 
[02:02:30]  I can't get over how awful.  Over the collar, you can't hear anything that's going on.  All you hear is that dumb beat.  People are saying that's the music from Madagascar.  Is it?  And supposedly.  This is Brian from St. Louis.  Hey, guys, how fitting is it that the music they're playing is the music from Madagascar  when the monkey things are dancing?  Oh, come on now.  That's what he's saying, man.  I just read him.  Here's what I think of, whoopie.  God damn rich horse. 
[02:03:00]  All right, here we go.  This was the one that made us really laugh and realize that she has absolutely nothing.  But I just want to make sure that you went to the movies.  I went to the movies because you told me to.  You gave me a look Friday like, if you don't go to the movies, Cubby, I'm going to whip you.  Well, that's all this is about.  Role reversal.  I'm going to be ordering you to do things that I don't have to do.  Would you like breakfast now?  I'll be more than happy to get it for you.  Well, I know that.  But when I'm ready, Cubby, I will send you off.  Did you know that today, as we said, is a good manners day? 
[02:03:30]  Do you know what the thing I want to talk about the next few seconds are?  I'm guessing good manners.  Good manners.  Please and thank you.  I'm going to.  What?  You don't hear that enough.  No, you don't.  And you know something?  When we come back, because we're getting ready to go into a break,  we're going to talk about you seeing the movie.  We're going to talk about manners.  We're going to tell people what time it is.  We're just going to take people where they need to go.  Good morning.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  You stink. 
[02:04:00]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Please and thank you.  Wow.  If you put a gun in your mouth, I'll say, please pull the trigger.  And after you do, I'll say, thank you.  Wow.  I kind of feel bad for Cubby.  I never thought I'd say that.  Guy in the business, 10 years, you know.  And she's not going to take any direction from anybody.  No, no.  She is so effed.  And he's got to play the punching bag, I guess. 
[02:04:30]  You know.  Oh, boy.  She thinks, like, having Manners Monday and having a nice show is going to get the job done.  See, everybody.  Especially in New York.  Are you kidding?  Everyone can be mean or a shock jock, Opie.  See, that's probably, they sat down like.  Right.  Look, everyone else out there is doing the shock jock thing.  Why don't we do the other thing?  The complete opposite.  Why?  We'll be your friendly radio show.  Because that's why shows like Rescue Me get an audience and get the people talking about it. 
[02:05:00]  Lucky Louie.  And get people watching.  Lucky Louie.  The Sopranos.  Deadwood.  Things like that.  And nice, wholesome shows end up on obscure channels like ABC Family.  Lifetime.  Ushered off to Lifetime and things like that.  Old series that couldn't make it.  Oh, because people are vicious by nature.  They don't want it.  They don't really want it thrown at them. 
[02:05:30]  But they kind of like seeing people slip and fall.  They like seeing people get hurt.  They like when the news is bad, especially in other countries where it doesn't involve us.  It makes it interesting.  It gives people things to talk about.  Hey, did you hear what happened?  Horrible accident.  Man, it was just the worst thing.  Yeah.  No one likes nice things unless it's happening to them directly.  But no one wants to hear about it.  No one wants Manners Monday.  We should try Manners Monday a little with our callers, Opie. 
[02:06:00]  Because I noticed you're a little mean to our callers.  If that guy called up, that called up would be showing and talked about which way he drives in or out.  You're driving east or west because this is fascinating.  How long is your commute?  Instead of going boring and hanging up on him, perhaps we should entertain the call and have some Manners.  Today should be Manners Monday.  I agree.  I think we should steal that bit immediately.  Oh, exactly.  I think this should be a more upbeat, positive show.  Because when someone says it's from Pennsylvania and you say, do you drive in and out of the city? 
[02:06:30]  That's a good question.  It is.  You're paying attention.  Right.  I'm glad you concur.  Thank you, Jimmy.  What chemistry between those two?  It's just magic.  And asking someone how long.  Bleach and ammonia.  Asking how long someone's commute is.  Yeah.  Especially, it's at least an hour.  Of course.  At least an hour.  That's all you need to know.  Probably two hours each way every day.  Whoopie.  It's miserable.  Because we're regular people.  We have to drive through this horse ass.  But where are you going to go with the answer? 
[02:07:00]  No matter what he says, you can't make it interesting.  No.  If he says 10 minutes or four hours, you're like, oh, okay.  Oh.  There's nowhere to go with that.  It's a complete dead-end question.  Well, Anthony in New York, what do you got?  Did you guys catch that part of her schtick was, when we come back, we'll tell you the  time?  Yeah.  That was part of her bit, which is just...  Do you realize that?  That was a tease, by the way.  People, when you tease when you're going into break, you're supposed to be telling people  something that's going to hold them through the commercials.  Breaking down Opie's 13th wall of radio here. 
[02:07:30]  Right.  You're supposed to be telling them something that's going to go, ooh, you know, I might want  to hear that.  The time?  Look, don't look at your clocks, people.  Don't look at any clocks in your car.  Don't look down at your radio.  Because there's a clock there.  I want to be the one that tells you the time.  Don't spoil my bit and look at the time in the car.  I'll tell you the time.  Because then you can change the station.  Right.  Holy tool.  That's like when we do a radio tease going into break.  Yeah.  And you're able to look at your radio dial and it tells exactly what we're going to do 
[02:08:00]  after the break.  That's what she just did.  Because as soon as you say time, wouldn't you like pop your head up and go, hey, what  time is it?  What time is it?  By the way, what time is it?  Let me look down.  You don't tease the time.  Well, I know what time it is.  Don't have to listen to this horse crap after the break.  It's the worst.  The worst.  The worst.  Of Whoopi and Anthony.  Hey, we got the Whoopi calls coming in.  You guys ready for this?  No.  I'm really not.  Well, there's people just tuning in.  Why don't you give the big setup, please?  Well, it's Wake Up With Whoopi.  We'd like to welcome her to New York. 
[02:08:30]  It's her first day on the air.  Over there at KTU, the station.  Hey, look at that.  We gave her a plug.  But she's with Cubby, who he's been in radio in New York for about 10 years.  He's one of these nice jocks.  Yeah, very nice guy.  Everything has to be nice.  Never really made any.  Don't ever get mean spirited.  Yeah.  Never really made any big news or anything, which, you know, that's fine.  You want to just have a radio career.  That's fine.  You don't have to be in the paper all the time or anything.  And he's eked out a nice career in New York over the years. 
[02:09:00]  If you're in New York for that many years, I guess you've got to be doing something right.  They boot your ass right out.  It's the number one market.  But they teamed him up with Whoopi.  And I just see it as very awkward.  They're trying to make this a nice show, trying to make Whoopi's show the nice show, the alternative to this nastiness that's all over the airwaves, permeating the airwaves.  So they made the mistake and gave out the phone number because they want listeners to call up. 
[02:09:30]  And our pests have been calling and getting through.  And it is the most awkward, cringe-inducing thing to listen to because they don't know how to handle it.  I mean, people call us, and when they bitch about us, we're so used to it.  We know just to go right into attack mode, it's very hard to get at us on this show.  We have a defense.  We have a great offense.  We're a great team here.  And they fall apart. 
[02:10:00]  They just wet themselves.  And it's over, Johnny.  A couple of calls in, they're already cracking.  She tries to get serious.  Yeah, tries to scold us and the callers.  And it's just cringe-inducing.  She doesn't get it.  No.  Well, we'll explain after you hear the audio.  But here's the first clip.  A Ramon call got through.  We're going to go to line 7 to Tony now in Garden City.  He's an EMS man.  Oh, we love the EMS.  Hello, Tony.  How's it going?  What's up?  Pretty good.  Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I was doing my round in Nassau County. 
[02:10:30]  I go into a Dunkin' Donuts for the morning coffee.  They have the show on.  And they said,  Ramon, you're a little Mickey Mouse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I felt that one coming.  Did you?  Did you feel it coming?  Did you?  Did you feel it coming?  It just, it just, the wheels fall off at the slightest little problem there. 
[02:11:00]  And this is, I felt, I, this is only the beginning.  That was a speed bump.  And all of a sudden she starts driving like Harry Chapin.  So, uh, well, she, uh, we got to her.  So, uh, here's, here's the next bit of audio.  Yeah.  What's cool.  We're a brand new show.  Today's our first day.  All right, hold on.  I got to address that because I forgot what Cubby does here.  If you're, if you're on the air going, you know, it's cool.  You know, it's great.  After you've just been bashed.  It's not cool.  And it's not great. 
[02:11:30]  You are miserable.  Right.  You're smiling and pretending you're eating cotton candy while that uncle breathes whiskey into your face from the back.  That's what you're doing.  Don't dissociate your silly goose.  You know, it's great.  You know, it's funny.  At this point, you realize you don't have the chops to deal with this.  And, and, and it's that you are screwed.  And it's early day one and you're already at a loss of what to do.  Yeah.  You've just walked into the new job and your greeting has been a kick to the teeth and you're wiping your gums in the sink going, you know, it's great. 
[02:12:00]  That other guy thought I was such a threat to his new job that he kicked me in the mouth.  Right.  And you don't know which other worker is going to kick you in the teeth throughout the rest of the day.  You know what?  You have lemons.  Just eat them as lemons.  Stop trying to make lemonade.  You don't have any sugar, stupid.  Get a sourpuss.  Exactly.  The glass is half empty.  Exactly.  No, it's not half full.  It's half empty.  And if it is half full, it's half full.  You know what's really cool? 
[02:12:30]  When you're trying to say something funny.  Isn't it funny?  Isn't it great?  When you flop, flop a line.  I hope they think the glass is half full and it is with AIDS.  They're going to come up with reasons why we're doing this.  It's the audio you're about to hear.  Let me make it perfectly clear for the listeners out there that don't really know about us yet.  We're just bored.  Yeah.  This spices up our morning.  It spices up the listening pleasure.  And it gives the pest something to do. 
[02:13:00]  A homework assignment.  That's all it is.  We're not thinking past that.  We're not thinking, uh-oh, this is competition.  We like making people miserable.  Yeah, it's fun.  And one reason, because we're bored and we have to fill up five hours of radio a day.  And because her last name is Goldberg, which is Jewish.  And we're gay.  As you know, when I get drunk, I don't like the Jews.  Oh, she's got the double whammy.  She's got the old Sammy Davis.  All right, here we go.  So they're going to explain what's going on here to their listeners. 
[02:13:30]  Getting it all wrong.  You know what's cool?  We're a brand new show.  Today's our first day.  Yeah.  But a lot of other radio stations are nervous about us.  And they're talking about us.  Well, but you know what?  You know what?  Why would I be nervous?  We got nothing to lose.  I'll tell you why we're nervous.  Because people who are listening to that dreck are going to throw their radios out the window  and not be able to tune in and hear us.  And it will affect us in the ratings.  They'll kick their radios.  Another whoopee clip.  Oh, help me.  Help me. 
[02:14:00]  Help me.  And a cubby clip.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Here we go.  And they're talking about us.  Well, but you know what?  You know what?  Why would I be nervous?  We got nothing to lose.  But you know what bugged me about that?  What?  Don't use the MS guys, man.  Don't use the MS.  When did we use the MS guys?  The MS?  Oh, I thought multiple sclerosis guys.  But she says MS. 
[02:14:30]  No, she said don't use the MS.  She said the MS.  Yeah, but all I hear is MS.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I guess she's trying to talk like ghetto.  No, here's what that is.  That's the cubby, a net for the cello tie-in.  Right.  Do you want to go with the MS?  Oh, wow.  Very good.  Jimmy.  There you go.  Great.  Tying it all together with the disease.  Old twisted root body with her stupid Mouseketeer's ears on.  That's right.  Have some peanut butter.  M-I-C.  See me walk?  No.  K-E-Y.  Why?  Because God hates me. 
[02:15:00]  She thinks we're messing with the MS guys.  Go screw.  This is the furthest like tie-in she could do is that to try to get to us by saying we're goofing on the EMS guy.  The EMS guy, the guy used the character to get through to our show, didn't goof on the EMS guy, didn't say anything bad about EMS.  Right.  Here we go.  Buddy, you know what?  Why would I be nervous?  We got nothing to lose.  But you know what bugged me about that? 
[02:15:30]  What?  Don't use the MS guys, man.  Don't use the MS to get on the radio.  Because here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  There are other folks out there.  Some of them are good and some of them are not.  We are no threat to anybody.  We're just doing a show that we want to be doing.  Howard understands that.  That's my friend.  These other people, they're not worth the dust Howard walks in.  Yeah, he'll help you.  So whatever they're doing, let him keep doing it.  But you know what?  Don't mess with the EMS.  Don't mess with the EMS.  Because you know what, y'all?  You other guys who are messing with us, they know where you are. 
[02:16:00]  You're listening.  Why did he laugh at that?  I'm telling you.  What does that mean?  You don't want to mess with the EMS, folks.  You don't want to mess with the EMS.  We're not messing with the EMS.  Who messed with the EMS?  What are they going to do anyway?  Show up and give us oxygen?  Yeah, they're going to put a little mask on us.  Don't mess with us.  We'll come over and swab your arms.  Watch it.  Watch it, Buster.  I'll put one of those neck braces on you.  You won't be able to turn your head.  Just showing she's completely clueless.  Poor Cubby having to laugh at that.  She said something that rhymed. 
[02:16:30]  Don't mess with the EMS.  Oh, that was almost funny.  I better laugh at something this morning.  And then Cubby tried to rhyme.  He said, you know, I hope ratings get bigger because I'm on the radio with...  Shame.  Shame.  Shame.  Shame on you.  Shame on you, Jimmy Norton.  What?  I beeped it.  Shame on you.  I could beep and talk at the same time.  Shame on you.  People don't understand that.  Do you mean I really probably didn't say anything?  You probably didn't.  Oh, well.  All right, here we go.  Here's the next whoopie clip that got through. 
[02:17:00]  And then we'll get an update from Doug OutDoug, one of the fine O&A pests.  And if you want to give us a call at 1-800-449-8686, know that we're going to probably screen  a little bit better because we have people trying to infiltrate.  But you know what?  Which flatters us, by the way.  It's a very wonderful thing.  It's a very wonderful thing.  But people who are unsure of themselves as human beings trying to help others.  Ew.  I'm not sure.  Ew.  Come on.  I'm missing all the goodness.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm missing all the goodness.  I have to. 
[02:17:30]  But if you get your teeth kicked in and you start to go for the psychoanalysis.  Right.  She's now psychoanalyzing us.  You're just doing that because you're insecure.  Exactly.  You got it.  You got us.  That's what all performers are.  We love watching other people bombing.  Exactly.  Why are you a stand-up comic, stupid?  Because you're insecure.  Thing.  It's a very wonderful thing.  But people who are unsure of themselves as human beings try to make trouble for others.  Waking up with Whoopi.  103.5. 
[02:18:00]  Cubby and Whoopi.  Hang and loose.  Holla.  Hang and loose.  Holla.  Oh, ew.  Did Cubby.  Wait a minute.  Ew.  Hold it.  Did Cubby just say holla?  Holla.  I hope not.  No.  That's a misunderstanding.  No, he didn't just say holla.  We do this to get under people's skin and we're bored.  That's the only.  We don't think further than that.  Cubby, stop it.  No, don't say holla. 
[02:18:30]  You don't do that.  Unless she's trying to shave you and fight the urge to cut your throat, you don't say holla.  Don't say holla.  We have any more coming in?  We got to take a break to catch up a little bit, but the Whoopi attack is on.  Hey, what's going on?  This is Andre 3000 and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:19:00]  For today, the last O&A pest call to the Whoopi program.  All right.  Well, I don't know what time the show goes till.  Oh, yeah.  There may be more.  There may be more.  I mean, once we get over to.  Don't mess with the EMS.  What time?  Oh, are you 10?  Nine.  They only go to nine?  See, we have no choice.  We have to end at nine so we can continue on XM.  Well, and I'm sure at nine o'clock they're going to be like, whew, thank God that's over.  This is payback for firing Gulbarjani, who's my friend.  Right.  I like Gulbarjani and I don't like the way he was let go. 
[02:19:30]  There you go.  Like the EMT.  You don't mess with him.  Here's the last.  Well, EMTs also actually called emergency medical technicians.  Yes.  Here's the last O&A pest call to Whoopi.  And now we got Jerry in New Jersey.  What line is he on?  New Jersey.  He's on line seven.  We had so many lines ringing, by the way.  I bet.  Why do you think?  I bet you do.  Why do you think?  Oh, they were all excited.  Oh, that's a shame. 
[02:20:00]  They were all excited when the lines are all lit.  Like, wow, we're a hit.  Look, we're an early hit.  The buzz is true.  Oh, no.  That is tragic.  All are good.  Oh, look at that.  Because you know.  Dude, you know how radio is.  Oh, yeah.  So you're looking at the lines going, oh, man, we're a hit.  Yeah.  Everyone's calling.  They're interested.  There's a buzz.  It's all our pests.  We're the buzz in New York radio.  And when we see our phones lit up, we're like, oh, all right.  All right.  We're on a subject that people might want to talk about. 
[02:20:30]  Something is happening.  Holla.  Holla.  We promoted this on our show.  Holla.  So all those calls ringing were our pest trying to get through.  And this one got through.  It's on line seven.  Lines two.  We had so many lines ringing, by the way.  Oh, my goodness.  Which is pretty cool.  They're all from my mom.  My mom's calling in.  What's his name?  Hey, Jerry.  Hi, it's Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Oh, I'm sorry.  They wrote down Jerry.  Yeah, it's my birthday.  I feel like it's been my birthday this whole year.  Oh.  I woke up today.  I realized it was my birthday, but I had the old gravy leg. 
[02:21:00]  So tonight I'm going to the O&A party, Rock, but I wanted you to take it.  All right.  I love the disgust.  That's my favorite part.  All right.  For the pest attack, I just love the disgust.  Oh, is that funny?  Old gravy leg.  Old gravy leg.  All right.  All right.  Oh, they're just disgusted. 
[02:21:30]  They're defeated.  Guy would have went on forever.  Various references.  To that dumb show that I got to make believe I don't know anything about.  That's the best, too.  That show that I have no clue about.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  The gravy leg.  So tonight I'm going to the O&A party, Rock, but I wanted you to take it.  All right.  It was like.  I don't even laugh.  You.  All right.  You.  Holla.  You.  All right. 
[02:22:00]  Looks like a wally.  Well, at least you get the real voice out of the guy.  Yeah.  It takes this to get the real voice instead of the.  Yeah.  That's good.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Listen.  Oh, I can't say.  Yeah.  Buster.  Yeah.  Listen, Buster.  Pally.  So tonight I'm going to the O&A party, Rock, but I wanted you to take it.  All right.  He's talking about another DJ.  Another DJ.  He brought up another DJ on here.  Wait.  Oh.  You know what's going on there? 
[02:22:30]  Oh, my God.  You can see her like moving.  You can feel it.  She's moving away from her mic.  What?  What?  What just happened?  What?  She has no clue.  What?  What's that about?  Cubby's probably making arm motions like, dump.  Get out of this.  She doesn't know what's going on.  So now he's got to explain without like giving us any recognition or really acknowledging  it.  Pandemonium.  What is the dishonesty about not saying the name?  And believe me, nobody here thinks that being on name show is going to make this show bigger.  But like we say, we'll be show KTU.  Tune in if you want.  There you go. 
[02:23:00]  Give it a shot.  Who cares?  Where is the bravery and honesty?  That must have just looked like the inside of the command module of Apollo 13 after hearing  that bang.  Just people waving their arm.  What the?  What?  What the?  What?  What?  Oh, God.  What?  Cubby, we have a problem.  How the?  I'm a gold gravy leg.  He's talking about another DJ, another DJ.  He brought up another DJ on here. 
[02:23:30]  Why wouldn't we just say, OK, are we afraid of another DJ?  Well, if he says another DJ, no telling what he'll say after that.  You will be the next call.  We'll be going to a bad place.  He was going to a bad place.  Yes, he was.  Well, Jerry, whatever your name is, that wasn't very nice.  And you know what?  It just goes to show you that we who have the button have the power.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Your night show stinks.  That's right. 
[02:24:00]  You know what else?  Instead of the button, you should have the shotgun trigger and your toe a-fumbling for it.  At least she asked, though, are we afraid of another DJ?  Hey, there you go.  At least she said that, which was honest.  But then later on, we heard the speech.  Because that call, we played these a little out of order.  That was the first one that got through.  The first one.  Then the subsequent ones that got through, you heard them talking about a heavier screening.  And that's not nice.  And we will not take those calls.  And that we're insecure.  Yeah. 
[02:24:30]  And then she uses Howie's name because she thinks Howie's going to help her.  Good luck.  It's Manor's Monday.  It is.  So people just being polite.  Mm-hmm.  I wonder what tomorrow is.  Yep.  It's the worst.  Anthony.  Let's say hi to Sean in New York.  Sean, what's up?  Hi.  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  It's the girly version of Sean.  We like when that happens.  I'm surprised.  It is a surprise because usually, like, guys will call and, like, their name will be Terry 
[02:25:00]  or something.  They'll be like, and we'll take the call because it's a girl.  And go, hey, Terry.  And then, hi, how you doing?  Ah, you're not Terry.  Out of here.  You're a guy.  And now we pick up Sean thinking it's going to be a guy.  And it's a girl.  Surprise.  It's a very nice surprise.  Yeah, I just want to say I love you guys.  Love, love, love you.  And I was listening to you yesterday talk about Whoopi.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Very disappointing.  And I didn't really believe you until I had to hear it for myself. 
[02:25:30]  And during your commercial break about 20 minutes ago, I went and I listened.  And you would not believe what is going on on that station.  What are they doing today?  She was listing, I kid you not, the ingredients in sunscreen.  Now, what are we going to do in the 8 o'clock hour today?  Because that's what we were going to do.  I don't know.  Damn.  I don't know.  She trumped you guys on that one. 
[02:26:00]  What the hell is she doing that for?  And why?  Shouldn't she have thought of that 42 years ago?  A little late for sunscreen.  The guy she's with is like totally going along with it.  Poor Cubby.  Yeah.  What, is she going to spend the whole morning talking about things she doesn't need to use?  Exactly.  She's like sodium benzoite.  That's wonderful.  Well, stupid Whoopi Goldberg, stupid Clear Channel.  And this is for you, Chicago, as well, because this dumb show is coming your way and we're 
[02:26:30]  not scared of it.  We'll promote the hell out of it.  I don't care.  Whoopi Goldberg has decided that the way to get into radio is to do a friendly, nice,  kind of like a Rosie O'Donnell thing.  When Rosie O'Donnell first started doing TV, it's all about being nice.  Before she's decked up, yeah.  And talking about manners and we're not going to do any shocking stuff.  Like the Mel Gibson story is huge.  Everybody's talking about it.  She wouldn't.  No.  She would not touch it because, hey.  Because yesterday was a manners Monday and I'm not kidding.  Well, where's the. 
[02:27:00]  I'd love to say that was a joke.  Right.  But she did like she said yesterday was going to be manners Monday.  As far as Gibson, this tells you what the show is going to be about.  When Gibson's arrest came up, she said he made a mistake and he's dealing with it.  And that's all I'm going to say about that.  People make mistakes.  That's it.  That's the way to do a radio show.  Don't address one of the biggest stories of the day.  Speaking of making mistakes, why did they hire her?  And today she's talking about the ingredients and sunscreen.  Well, good luck to you there, Whoopi.  You know who tried the same thing? 
[02:27:30]  I'm sorry, Sean.  Radio took such a downside turn, you guys.  You know what?  It's so nice to have you guys back, let me tell you.  Thanks a lot, Sean.  It's good to hear that type of talk.  Oh, yes.  It was almost nice talking to you.  Yes, you should hang up because this is about to get uncomfortable for all of us.  You're being nice and we're fighting the urge to be vicious.  Niceness stinks.  It really does.  Overrated.  You know who tried that once?  Marie Osmond.  There's another one.  Comes out of nowhere and thinks she's going to do a radio show. 
[02:28:00]  And they pushed it as this whole nice thing.  She's just going to be nice.  Got syndicated to a bunch of markets and it failed miserably.  It's basic human nature to be vicious.  We like things.  Even if you're a nice person at heart and you treat people nicely, when you watch the news, you don't want your life to be boring.  Life is in general is pretty boring, especially if you're nice.  So you like to be entertained by things that are a little more vicious. 
[02:28:30]  The news knows this.  That's why they show dead people and bombings all the time.  Gives you a little thrill when the terrorism alert goes up.  You might not like it.  You don't want to see it.  But it's like, oh, wait.  Wait, what happened?  Did you hear?  People like to gossip.  Hey, did you hear?  And that's what it's all about.  So the nice thing just doesn't work.  I think they explained it in The Matrix.  They made a perfect society where people didn't have to work.  And people were dropping dead.  They need life. 
[02:29:00]  You need a little bit of crap thrown in there.  Yeah, just be honest.  Stop trying to force niceness at everybody's throat.  Stop trying to be chipper in the morning.  Cheery.  You're a breath of fresh air on the way to work.  Nobody wants that, stupid.  No.  No.  There's always that smell when you go into the subway.  Absolutely.  And that ain't a breath of fresh air.  That's a homeless guy who drank too much.  You know what this show is?  It's the gunk you find under your shoe where you curse the neighbor's dog.  That's what's bleeding out of your radio.  And it's very easy, too.  Like, let's say you're driving to work and there's a massive traffic jam. 
[02:29:30]  What do you want to see?  Do you want to see some housewife changing a tire on her minivan, or do you want to see  a horrific accident by the time you get to the clog?  Well, that's why they rub her neck.  Exactly.  Because they want to see the wreck.  Exactly.  What I want to see is Whoopi naked in the shoulder applying sunscreen.  Reading the ingredients.  Yeah.  Hey.  Things she doesn't need.  Yeah, she's going to be talking about a comb the next hour.  Yeah, flying standby.  He writes, hey, Whoopi's talking about things she doesn't use. 
[02:30:00]  So the next hour is about job applications and humor.  Screwed up his life.  Whoopi was a funny comic, too.  Like, there was a time I really loved Whoopi Goldberg.  I'm not going to say she sucked, because she was a good stand-up.  I just, I don't know when I stopped liking her.  I never really liked her act.  Like, she did that one-woman show thing, and that's kind of where she came from.  That's, like, got her popularity.  And it was just, like, those one-woman show things are so hack.  Oh, look, she's doing a valley girl, and she's black. 
[02:30:30]  I get it.  Well, this is what happened yesterday.  So she starred on the radio here in New York, and we have O&A Pest.  Most people know that now.  Actually, the media is starting to really pick up on the fact that we have pests.  There are shows out there that try the Army thing, and you sign up online, and you get a number.  You'll get a sticker or a patch or some dog tags if you're in the station's army.  But you actually never do anything for that show? 
[02:31:00]  No, because it's forced on you.  But it just sounds cool?  There's not a natural passion for what you're listening to.  It's kind of a forced thing, usually tied into some kind of contest.  You know, you get into a club for half price if you're wearing their dog tag of the army or something lame like that.  But we have O&A Pest.  It's a lot different.  Who are just the opposite of the army whole thing, whereas we give you nothing, and you do all the footwork.  Right.  You do all the work.  In return, you get nothing.  Although, you do get a little link in the big city papers. 
[02:31:30]  That's right.  And it's a way of protecting the Opie and Anthony show, by the way, because we learned years ago that any stupid organization with a letterhead can get you kicked off the radio.  So we decided to fight back by developing this whole O&A Pest mentality where we attack back.  And we didn't even do it.  They took it upon themselves, really.  We named them pests because there was no word that described them better.  They just pester you.  It's like when you're trying to sleep in a hot room on a summer night and a mosquito that you can kill just right in your ear all night long. 
[02:32:00]  That's what our fans are like.  They're cold sores.  They're just horrid.  The corner of the mouth, cold sores.  Yeah.  They're a collection of breathing, walking cold sores.  And you can't stop opening your mouth.  Ow.  Ow.  They're a little zit right in your nostril.  Just the pain that you can't quite get at.  Oh, that's by it.  Know why that happens?  Why is that?  When you pull out the long ones. 
[02:32:30]  No.  Maybe when you pull out the long ones.  When I pull out the long ones.  I use a tissue and I cannot look at the body product.  No, I'm talking about the hair.  Oh, a hair?  I mean, I try to keep it all trim and stuff.  But every once in a while you'll be feeling around and you go, oh, that's a little long.  And you pluck it out and that's what causes the pimples.  You'll get an ingrown hair.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So, anyway, yesterday it was Whoopi.  Thanks for that helpful hint.  You know, we try to teach things here on the show, too.  So, yesterday was Whoopi's first day in New York.  I know.  And the pest decided to welcome her to New York Opie and Anthony style. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, pest style.  And they had no clue.  We were coming at them yesterday.  So, they were putting all our O&A pests on the air.  And Whoopi was getting all pissed off and stuff.  Yeah.  And we had a lot of fun.  So, now the New York Daily News wanted to do a little story on her first day.  And we're all over the article.  Whoopi.  I'll just read some of the good parts here.  Whoopi for civility on her first day.  Civility.  Being civil. 
[02:33:30]  That's so nice of her.  Should we give the update before I read the article or after?  About the phone calls that happened after the show yesterday?  Whatever you want to do.  I don't know.  Well, the O&A pest got to Whoopi and Cubby and Clear Channel so bad  that all the big execs at Clear Channel calling our bosses trying to get us in trouble.  Ew.  For what?  Yep.  Oh, it's illegal to be playing Whoopi audio on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, I know.  It's illegal.  Because two stations crash and burn.  And you know what? 
[02:34:00]  Our lawyers did the right thing.  They fought for us.  And guess what?  It's not illegal.  It's called acceptable usage.  And we'll continue to play her awful radio show on our program when it makes sense.  Yep.  You know?  When a pest gets through.  But remember yesterday, because we played a clip of her going,  Hey, you know, you guys aren't going to get to us.  We're just doing our thing here.  That was her first comment.  Right.  Or whatever it was.  I'm paraphrasing or whatever.  A few more calls in.  She cracked.  Yeah, I guess she did crack.  It didn't take long.  As soon as they were off the air, they had all sorts of meetings over there trying to make a stop already. 
[02:34:30]  Yeah.  So the New York Daily News, good old David Hinckley on top of what's going on in radio in New York.  The Post has just given up on radio in New York.  Every once in a while, they'll do a cute little article and get everything wrong.  David Hinckley writes,  Whoopi Goldberg made it clear yesterday that her new morning radio show would rather promote thank you notes than poke into Mel Gibson's drunk driving arrest.  She actually was saying something about the fact that the thank you note is a thing of the past, Opie.  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  That people really aren't writing and mailing out thank you notes.  What year do you live in?  Because we have text messaging and email, stupid.  Who wants to read a little post-it?  Oh, the yellow post-it with a thank you on it.  What, does she get a quill and write it in calligraphy?  Dear sir, thank you.  There's no...  That's gone.  That type of stuff is really gone.  Maybe it is unfortunate, but it's just the way it is.  Now you email.  Is this from today? 
[02:35:30]  Thanks, ass.  Thanks a mil.  Huh?  Thanks.  Thanks for the happy ending.  We got Whoopi talking about us today.  What happened?  What did we do?  She upset.  Look, man.  Barely touched her.  Keep it positive, Whoopi.  Keep it positive.  Right.  You're not going to find a more honest show than the Opie and Anthony show, okay?  So whatever she's telling our listeners is complete BS.  I haven't even seen this yet.  Haven't heard anything about this yet.  I mean, I haven't heard this yet.  This is hot off the present.  All right.  So getting back into it.  So Whoopi Goldberg made it clear yesterday that her new morning radio show would rather 
[02:36:00]  promote thank you notes than poke into Mel Gibson's drunk driving arrest.  Goldberg and her partner, longtime Z100 afternoon host Cubby Bryant, made nice at every turn  during their first morning.  Uh, tell me something good, Goldberg said to callers, who she praised for projects that  range from creating jewelry for adoptive parents to playing music at senior centers.  Holy Jesus.  Are you kidding me?  Did you read that last statement say, please? 
[02:36:30]  The last sentence?  The last sentence?  Hold on.  Read back from the transcript.  I need a nice sound effect for this.  Promote something positive.  I'm sure Pat Munaki might have a...  I got it.  I got it, Jimmy.  Uh, yeah, uh, tell me something good, Goldberg said to callers, who she praised for projects  that range from creating jewelry for adoptive parents to playing music at senior centers.  Oh.  Oh, shush.  A little too much sugar. 
[02:37:00]  I think that was a little too sweet for him.  You are finished in radio before you even begin...  You know what music you should play in senior centers?  Taps.  Watch them shuffle around in their white shoes while you play taps.  You dope.  The only music she should hear is the Muzak over the sound system getting lower and lower  as a male nurse puts a pillow over your face.  Exactly.  As you're asking Nurse Ratched to turn you down before the big Indian smothers you because 
[02:37:30]  you've been lobotomized.  Play some music for the seniors.  Shut your face.  That's what they should hear.  I'm hung.  Shut up, old person.  Old people can, uh, play along with the rhythm section with the Velcro on their diaper.  Wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee.  We're here on the Opie and Anthony show, we bully the elderly.  That's right.  Make that into a promo, Steve.  They're easy targets. 
[02:38:00]  That's right.  We know.  Can't even run.  They can't hear you, but they respond to a fist.  You know it's easy to catch them, too, if they're using one of those walkers with the wheels and  the hand brakes on it.  You don't know the tension release you feel when you hit a real old person and they fall backwards  and their shoes are still right where they left them.  If you need hand brakes to stop a piece of aluminum that weighs three ounces, maybe it's  time to cash it in, Burden. 
[02:38:30]  Exactly.  Oh, go put the tennis balls on the front of it so it doesn't scrape up your floor.  Don't you notice when a company comes over, your family puts you in the little small bathroom  with the cat box and you sit there and you talk to those little coated treats.  You sit there for an hour.  Right on, man.  Right on.  You sit on the tub, irrelevant.  Ah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, back in the, yeah, we know.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  The cat's even bored with you. 
[02:39:00]  Continuing with the whoopee article from the New York Daily News today.  Thank you notes came up as part of the Manor's Monday theme wherein Goldberg lamented the  erosion of civility.  Yeah.  We're going to save this woman, by the way, because as each day goes by, one of these  days, she's just going to unload and drop the C-bomb on us and everything.  She's going to lose her mind.  She asked for callers' pet peeves about manners like not offering seats to pregnant women. 
[02:39:30]  What?  Holy crap.  Why would you give some pregnant chick, she's one chick you know you can't bang, why be  nice to her?  When Gibson's arrest came up, like I said, she said he made a mistake and he's dealing with  it and that's all I'm going to say about that.  People make mistakes.  Pest alert.  Pest alert.  Pest alert.  Offer a pregnant woman a seat on a boat in Modesto.  Here's where the pests get involved.  In the world of morning radio, often edgy and usually at least mildly suggestive, Whoopi 
[02:40:00]  in the Morning at times made a family-friendly station like WOR sound like Opie and Anthony.  Whoa.  Speaking of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  The WFNY team encouraged their prank-minded listeners and then, in quotations and parentheses,  pests.  Pests.  See, at least he knows the terminology.  To call Goldberg.  While Bryant dumped the calls, they spurred Goldberg's only flash of mild annoyance. 
[02:40:30]  Howard Stern is my friend, she said.  Really?  These others are not worth the dust he walks on.  Dust is a good word.  Opie and Anthony responded with glee.  Opie saying, go back to Hollywood, you bitch.  Nice quote to have in the paper.  You're angry.  You're an angry man.  Yeah, as you smile ear to ear.  Shut up. 
[02:41:00]  It's hysterical.  And then it says, welcome to New York.  And then it continues with how nice her show is and how boring it is.  How do I cry now?  Lance over Mel Gibson.  That's a big story.  You probably know him.  You've met him.  Well, that's the problem.  That's why she's not going to be able to do honest radio, because you're going to have  to talk bad about your friends sometimes.  People make mistakes.  Well, there's a really original sentiment.  How old are you?  Four?  A mistake isn't something like Mel Gibson did.  That's an ideology.  That's like saying, you know, Hitler and the Nazis made a mistake. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  You know, it's one of those things, a mistake, driving drunk could even be considered a mistake.  That was the mistake.  You have a couple of beers.  You don't realize maybe you're over the limit.  You drive.  You blow into it.  You're over the limit.  No, I just realized, Bill from Waterford, sorry to, I got to back up slightly.  Yes, San Francisco.  Anthony mentioned a boat in Podesto.  Oh, well, I'm trying to keep it local for the people.  How far?  And then he writes, get used to it.  Yeah.  See, we were getting away with murder before we added San Francisco as one of our affiliates. 
[02:42:00]  He moved close to San Francisco after she disappeared for a while.  It's close enough.  All right.  So here's the latest on Whoopi.  This is from this morning.  Whoopi addresses ONA, the pests, and Howard.  Explains how she's making moves to deal with the rude callers, which is to say she isn't.  Here's the audio from today.  She tried to get our bosses to get us in trouble, and it's just not going to happen there, Whoopi. 
[02:42:30]  Well, this involves us.  Let's give it a listen.  I like it.  Because you know what?  Chin up, Whoop.  When it comes to radio, we're smarter than you.  On the other hand, there are shout-outs there from other people we're not even going to think about.  Don't even mention them.  Well, no.  You know, you have to mention that you know that they're there.  But, you know, I'm thinking they call me something ugly.  They call me some kind of weird word.  Are you going to do something about it?  And I already did.  Oh, you did?  Oh, yeah.  They won't know when or how.  Oh, you slide under the radar. 
[02:43:00]  I am just like, you know, ozone air.  Nice.  But good morning to you, Opie and Anthony, whatever your name is.  Glad that you're around, too.  Hey, Howard, we love you.  You know what?  Howard's not going to help you, Whoopi.  Yeah, Whoopi, sorry.  He's got his own problems to deal with.  You're such a stupid newbie.  He thinks, like, using Howard's name is going to get to us and get us all scared.  Howard's not helping you, Whoopi.  Howard ain't protecting you, Whoopi.  He's barely doing his own job these days. 
[02:43:30]  I think he's off.  I think he's in the Hamptons somewhere.  Right.  I don't even know if he's broadcasting.  Who knows anymore when he broadcasts.  You know who could help her?  The DJ that's playing that stupid same beat behind her.  How about turning it down and talking?  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Nobody wants to hear that.  Can't hear what that boar has to say with that beat going on behind it.  You're going to have to go to Plan B because Howard's not going to help you.  He doesn't give a crap about you and your stupid radio show.  Out in the Hamptons, I can't be reached. 
[02:44:00]  Please leave a message.  Hi, Howard.  It's Whoopi.  And I just want to say that O&A gave me trouble and I need your help.  Damn it.  Hi, this is Howard.  I'm in Hamptons.  You can't reach me right now, but I'll try to get back to you.  Stop it.  I invented the messaging machine.  Yeah, Howard.  It's Whoopi.  I got cut off.  I just want to let you know that O&A. 
[02:44:30]  No, she didn't.  Mailbox full.  Right.  Yeah, Howard's going to help you.  Sure he is.  Sure he is.  That's enough.  She's done.  Thanks.  Oh, and you know, there's nothing better than when people say something doesn't bother them  over and over again because it just means it really, really bothers them.  And it looks like the comment about calling her a bitch really got to her.  There's nothing you can do about that, Whoopi.  It sounds like she's going to try to do something behind the scenes. 
[02:45:00]  What are you going to do?  Uh-oh.  You're going to sue me for calling you a bitch?  You're going to get Ted Danson after you.  We won't know when.  No, what they're going to do is they're going to send Sister Act 2 over and we'll just kill  ourselves watching it.  They're going to put us in straitjackets and make us watch that horse crap.  That was like some kind of veiled threat almost.  There's nothing we can do, Whoopi.  Is it like some kind of a veiled threat?  No.  He won't know what's coming, but oof.  I have nothing.  Whoopi's West Coast. 
[02:45:30]  All right.  So I'm trying to figure out what to do.  So right now I'll act like I'm working on a plan whenever I'm not.  I'm just babbling while good old Cubster yucks it up.  Poor Cubby.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, I slide into the radar.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Cubby is the most like cherub, cherub looking white guy you'd ever see.  Holla.  And yeah, when he yesterday said holla because he's, you know, the co-host with a black woman. 
[02:46:00]  So he's got to kind of black himself up, I guess.  Is that the strategy there?  I guess.  Because when he said holla, ugh.  All right.  Just don't.  Stay out of the urban.  And by the way, we're going after Whoopi.  Vernacular.  We're going after Whoopi because it's fun.  We're not threatened by her and her awful show.  We're just dicks.  We're just dicks.  It's fun.  It is really fun.  And we're just flat out bored. 
[02:46:30]  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Hey, this is Don Wicklin from XM and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Enjoy it.  Whatever.  Fuck off.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  She's got to love.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Who's this?  Elo.  What's up, dude?  Is that Elo?  That's Elo.  That's Eric Logan.  You don't return my calls.  Get the fuck out of here.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Jimmy, turn around.  No.  All right.  All right.  Holy shit.  All right. 
[02:47:00]  Holy Jesus.  Mother of God.  We're in trouble.  You know something.  You got balls.  You got balls.  Bravo, Whoopi.  Whoopi Goldberg in studio.  Wow.  Good morning.  Good to see y'all.  I understand you've been sending messages for me to come and visit.  So I decided I'd come up and see y'all because I know you were concerned about a couple of  things and I really wanted to clear it up, you know, because especially the whole thing  about the, you know, the, uh, what do you call it? 
[02:47:30]  The, the what?  The stuff that you put on your-  Oh, the sunscreen.  Yeah, the sunscreen.  Because I know you were concerned that black people didn't know anything about sunscreen.  So I thought I'd come up and tell you your mamas were wrong.  They put the wrong shit on you.  You know what?  So let me just run through all of it.  All right.  So it's here and I'm pleased to see y'all.  I'm pleased to see y'all this morning.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  Holla.  What's up, boys?  Oh, hi, Whoopi.  This is so amazing.  She's so amazing.  Oh, man.  Like, this shit is like super, this is like-  No, you have no idea. 
[02:48:00]  Patrice, we've been, we've been beating her up the last three days.  She just started doing a radio show here in New York City.  Welcome to New York Radio.  I just saw you the other night, by the way.  Where were you?  I was over at the Stephen King reading.  Was that amazing?  Very, very amazing.  The three of them just, I, I was loving it.  And let me tell you something.  I was sitting directly up front.  I, I, like, got the, I went through the auction, got, you know, it's a great charity.  Right, right, right.  Went through, got front row tickets.  Right.  I hear, and now, well, let's introduce the star of Sister Act and stuff. 
[02:48:30]  Me and my girlfriend looked at each other and went, holy shit.  Fucking Whoopi's coming out.  If she looks down, oh, no.  I, I didn't expect it.  I, we were laughing our asses off.  And, uh, and I said, the next day I came in and got, and said, Whoopi was very funny at that podium.  It was a good night.  It was a good night.  I got, you were in your element, and that was great.  It was very cool.  But the fact you two guys have been shitting on that show, I mean, should definitely now give you pause because she came in.  Shut the fuck up.  You were right with us. 
[02:49:00]  You are an instigator.  I agree with the word with that.  And Petrine, just keep eating so you don't even have to talk on this whole thing.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  You know, I, I knew that I was going to get something from somewhere.  And so I expected, and it was cool.  It was cool.  So, the, the fleas, what do you call them?  The, the pests.  The pests.  The fleas.  You know?  Because that's funny.  Why aren't you doing this stuff on your show?  Because my show is geared to women in the morning. 
[02:49:30]  And that's the, that's what we're doing.  That's why it's a whole different group.  It's a whole different group.  It certainly is.  It's a whole different group.  So I'm trying to, I'm trying to be good.  Let's be honest, did the, uh, one pest get to you as you're sitting there?  You know what?  It, it, it didn't get to me until I left the studio and there were a couple guys around.  And it kind of, it made me uncomfortable because here's the, I can't hit anybody.  You know what I mean?  So if somebody comes up to do something, my first instinct is to, that they're going to  hurt me. 
[02:50:00]  Right, right.  So they freaked me out a little bit.  But no, you know, I'm aware of what you guys do.  You know, I know how you work and I've known your show.  You've been around forever.  Wait, but everybody knows that.  I know.  You know, everybody knows that, but, but you know what?  Why do they have to show up?  You ruined everything.  You really did ruin everything.  God damn it.  We had weeks in us.  I know you did.  I know you did.  We had the whole month of September ready to go.  You know, but you can always come back when do it, but just let me establish the ladies  first, please.  Because here's what happened. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Because they jammed the, uh, the phone lines.  You can't talk to anybody.  And all of these women got really pissed off and said, you know what?  If we can't talk to you, we're not going to, we're not going to listen.  And that kind of flipped everybody.  She's asking for a truce.  No, no, I'm not.  I'm, I'm saying to you, you guys have been doing your show for years on both ends.  And I know that a lot of people concerned, they say, why are you doing this?  You know, the truth is, I can't be me and still do the movies I used to do because people  are too nervous about it. 
[02:51:00]  They just get paid.  You say one thing, they're like, oh, we can't, we can't work.  You can't say that anymore.  So you have to kind of just sort of, you know, no, he'll always work.  Yeah.  He'll always work.  But you can't, you know, so I think to myself, do I really want to go back and forth to California  and beg for work?  And these guys said, you know, we're not afraid.  We'll put you on because we're trying to get to the women.  I said, cool.  Stay in New York, stay home, have a good time.  I love you guys.  I know you're out there, you're silly as hell.  But you always have been.  You always have been. 
[02:51:30]  I hate this.  You know, well, shit.  We have to be with Whoopi.  No, you don't.  You can actually be yourselves if you want to.  We were so excited.  Hold on.  I got to tell you.  We were so excited that we were going to have a new enemy.  We can't.  I know.  Now she comes in all night.  Now we have to go.  Can we trade Jimmy for Cubby?  I don't know.  But I.  This is all fun.  But this is to me what a comic is.  This is what a comic does as opposed to an actor, like a pure actor.  A pure actor would just hide and nothing.  This is a comic. 
[02:52:00]  It just comes out and confronts it.  You know what?  I thought I might.  I thought I might.  Where's your next stop?  Beirut?  Jesus Christ.  If I can.  Listen.  You know I don't fly.  I have to take a bus.  You war wrecker.  I know.  I'm a bitch.  I'm a bitch.  But you know what it is?  If you understand what folks do, if you understand the rag and if you know what it is, then you can sort of deal with it a little bit better.  But if you don't, and you know actors are sensitive that they're not comics.  They're not comics. 
[02:52:30]  And so they don't have the thick skin that we like to think that we have until somebody messes with us and then our lips poke out and then we go, yeah, I'm a good help.  All insecure and stuff.  Yeah.  Down deep, all of us are like really insecure.  So the best way to get around it is to just beat somebody else off.  Aren't we awful people?  Just to make ourselves feel better.  But you know what?  It's cool.  We can have our listeners call tomorrow and say how great you are.  No, they won't believe it.  They won't believe it.  But just if you tell them to call, it's cool to call. 
[02:53:00]  Just don't physically, don't scare them.  By the way, is that guy going to kick our ass?  Yeah, wow.  Who is he?  He looks like he's like, why are you doing this, Whoopi?  He's just waiting for a problem.  No.  Who is he?  This is my company partner.  We run our company together.  You cool?  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I just want to come in and see.  He's not loving this.  He's like, I told you not to do this.  Get it over with it.  Get the hell.  No, I got to say, Whoopi, bravo, man.  Should we or should we not?  And the idea of coming up and saying, Look, here's what's happening. 
[02:53:30]  We're all trying to make a little dough.  We're trying to make a living, having some fun.  And I thought I figured, again, I felt like I got a lot of telegrams from you to come over  and visit.  A lot of people are saying we're scared and stuff.  No.  No, I got to do it.  She would have set up balls on this woman.  She comes in.  We respect people that come to us face to face.  What are you going to do?  What did he want them to hit me?  I know, right?  The woman comes in here and sits down and just starts talking. 
[02:54:00]  The reality is bravo.  I did just grab the mic, didn't I?  I just grabbed the mic and like, okay.  Yeah, that mic's been waiting for you.  Bravo.  Listen, all you listeners, all you O&A listeners, we know that you're out there.  We know you're having a good time.  We know what you're doing.  You got to give the guys kudos, man.  You got to give them kudos.  You can't be pissed that they are respectful.  When I'm respectful to them, they're not going to smack me down.  What do you think they're going to do?  You do a very different show than us, and that's why it's so easy to goof on.  Yes.  And we're not going for the same audience.  No, no, no.  But you just took away all our fun. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  We played your demo tape this morning.  What the hell are we going to rag on now?  Do we have anybody?  We have to go back to Jim Kerr.  Oh, God.  Not Jim Kerr.  He's on 104.3.  Jim Kerr and the morning crew.  Or something.  I have to apologize to Whoopi.  Why?  Why did you say something really bad?  You read it in the paper.  Oh, you call me a bitch.  You know, here's the deal.  But you have to apologize to him.  It's true.  Why?  Why?  Because I said you don't know when I'm...  And here's what I'm talking about. 
[02:55:00]  Who's going to apologize first?  Because you have to apologize to him.  I apologize.  Because you got to us a little bit with the Howard Stern thing.  I'm sorry.  Did I really?  No, not really.  No, I didn't.  You're so full of bananas.  Full of bananas.  Full of bananas.  We just love seeing our name in the paper.  We're in the paper again today, matter of fact.  Yes, you are.  Yeah, we're publicity whores.  We know it.  Whoopi, I apologize for calling you a bitch.  You know what?  It's okay because it's true.  There are occasions when the biatch comes out of me. 
[02:55:30]  See, you know what it is?  I'm trying to remember all the stuff I'm not supposed to say, but I'm okay because I'm on  the satellite.  So I'm like, okay, don't say, figure out a better way to say, it's a lot of new stuff.  Just forget all about satellite radio when you go in tomorrow.  Yes, yes, because when I go in tomorrow, I'll be like, hey, motherfucker.  Welcome to Wake Up with fucking Whoopi.  I could get in a little bit of a jam.  I could get in a little bit of a jam.  By the way, that goddamn little theme was stuck in our head all morning.  Which one?  Because we played it all morning.  We played it all morning. 
[02:56:00]  Do we have it here?  Wake up with whoop.  How'd it go?  We don't have it here.  Why would it?  Well, no one knew you were coming.  It's the whole, wake it up with whoopi.  You knew.  It's like a little jingle thing.  Is it the jazzy one?  Yeah, it's almost jazzy, like almost an old-time jingle with a couple of voices in there and  stuff, and it got stuck in our heads.  We were cursing you.  Are you really going to try a nice show, though?  As a comic, you've got such an edge to you.  That's what I don't understand.  You know what it is?  When I go do my stuff, it's mine. 
[02:56:30]  When I'm working for them, it's like doing the Oscars.  When I'm working for them, I can be funny, but I'm on that mill.  I'm on the treadmill.  When you're doing a show in front of some Democrats, too.  Well, actually, were you there?  No, I was not there.  See, I wish I could find somebody who was there, because in fact-  Wait, what are you talking about, by the way?  She kind of ripped into the Republicans.  I actually didn't.  It was reported.  It was reported.  And that's the most interesting thing about this, is it doesn't have to be true anymore.  Someone can say something, and it's right there, and people run with it. 
[02:57:00]  And then when it's not true, they say, oh, I'm really sorry it wasn't true.  But when they're saying it, it's like, hey, where did she do it?  But it's not that I hadn't done it.  I didn't do it that night.  I don't mind taking heat for stuff I do.  But blame me when I do it.  Yeah.  You know?  So it was a little bit disingenuous on their part to sort of make a big deal.  You've been known to pick on a few people, though, and be a little potty mouth sometimes.  I have no problem with potty mouth.  I love potty mouth.  Yeah. 
[02:57:30]  And I'm mostly on politicians from either side.  But see, whenever one side is talking about how much of a potty mouth I have and how much  I rag on them, they never mention that I rag on the other side as well.  I rag on everybody because they're all full of poo-poo to me.  You get that sometimes we'll be talking, and then you'll get like the-  You see what I just said?  Poo-poo.  You can say shit.  What happened to me?  Just say shit.  The left will call you like a right-wing lunatic, and then you say something else, and then  you get like-  And then the other side.  Yeah, the next feedback you get is the same thing from the other side. 
[02:58:00]  You know, it's never-ending.  And after 20 years, I know this.  You know?  And you kind of go, yes, okay, I know this is going to happen.  But, you know, when I'm doing my stuff, when it's my stuff, when nobody else has to take  any heat for it or any responsibility for it, then I can go berserk.  But when it's about something else, that's what I'm going to do.  It's not so much that it's a nice show, but look at this, man.  Look at all these papers.  I can't look at them anymore.  I can't handle it anymore.  But that's just it.  Now, you've only been on a couple of days, but is it hard to steer away from that? 
[02:58:30]  I mean, there's got to be some days where you wake up and go, God, I just want to rip  this guy apart.  Wednesdays are my days to just, because we call it Kvetch Wednesday.  And Peeves, people have Peeves.  You have to give every day a name.  Manners Monday.  Yeah.  We heard Manners Monday.  Manners Monday.  What was Tuesday?  Tuesday, you don't remember?  Full prostate.  Fuck them Friday.  Speaking of which, have you guys done, have you gone and had your prostates checked?  All joking aside. 
[02:59:00]  Let me tell you.  First one was last year.  I just went back.  In three months now is my next year, and I have to go get the, it's not fun, Whoopi.  It's not fun, but you know what?  It's not fun.  Do you know how many people have, I've lost so many male friends that it's become really  like a pain in the ass crusade for me.  Literally.  But I'm tired of, yeah, for a pain in your ass, not mine.  My ass is fine.  And I picked a doctor for his credentials.  You should go in first and see if he's like, he's La Mata.  You know?  It's so true. 
[02:59:30]  You know, I want a little pencil finger guy.  Dr. Pencil finger.  A midget.  Find a midget doctor.  Did you, have you had it?  No, not yet.  Please do it, please, please, please.  I'm only 27, though, so.  It doesn't, these days it doesn't matter.  Yeah.  I'm going soon, actually.  My youngest friend, who has had it, was 25.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  What's the symptoms?  I don't know.  That's why you have to go in and get a PSA check.  I really don't know.  But Patrice was just talking about how ugly his ass is.  You know what?  It doesn't matter?  I think it's okay. 
[03:00:00]  As long as you don't ask anybody to kiss it, it should be fine.  But a doctor is going to really not like, that's got to be a bad day for a proctologist.  I didn't say my asshole was ugly.  I said my ass cheeks.  When you come in for a prostate exam, that's got to be like a bad day for a doctor.  Fuck that.  No.  Not really.  Not if it's clean.  I'm just saying.  I just want to know the symptoms.  Patrice, just go get it.  Nice young lad comes in.  Frequent urination and things like that.  I think that's a large prostate, but you need to go and look. 
[03:00:30]  You made me go.  We flew back from L.A. one time, and I pissed so much.  He's like, you should be checked for diabetes.  He panicked me.  I've been checked like three times since then for diabetes.  You're a hypochondriac.  No, I just pee a lot.  I am too, though.  I can't watch House, that goddamn show.  It started as a hangnail.  House now has to kill three babies to save one.  What?  What the hell?  What did he?  I got that.  Can everybody that has a problem with you guys now come in?  No.  To the station to apologize?  Yeah, because we are pussies in that way.  Can Jim Kerr come in and say, hey, we don't even know what he does. 
[03:01:00]  Richard Huff.  I just threw that name out.  Richard Huff is a writer that wrote the story about us in the Daily News this morning.  We had a problem with him.  He bashed the pests in our show and stuff a little bit.  Had a problem with him.  Got him on the phone.  By the end of the conversation.  He was best friends.  Pals.  We can't stand when people confront us.  So the secret is don't meet anybody.  Whoopi Goldberg, let's be honest here.  She's been around ever since Around the World and 80 motherfucking days. 
[03:01:30]  The whole story.  You understand?  So when you see her, she becomes real.  Just like if Mel Gibson with his goofy face and his Jew remarks comes in here, you could  not bash him like you do on the radio.  Oh, you know.  That Nuremberg trial thing really was a little over John Mel.  You know what I mean?  I understand.  Hey, I agree with you.  You know what I mean?  I feel the same way about those Jews and their influence.  He was just annexing what was his. 
[03:02:00]  We're going to have to lock the doors for now.  You can't have it.  It happens.  No matter who comes in, you can't just go, oh, now you're here, motherfucking Whoopi.  Right.  What was with that Ted dancing shit motherfucking years ago?  You got to come in here and you just, I just bring it up, old shit.  I know.  I know.  I know.  What happened?  Is it, let me, can I ask you a question?  Maybe.  Did you say it or what, are you, do you have a problem with Oprah?  No.  I've never had an Oprah problem.  What did I read about Oprah not inviting you to something?  A big woman thing. 
[03:02:30]  And you was upset or somebody thought she was upset?  No, people, no, people keep asking me how come you're not there.  I keep saying because it's her thing and she didn't invite me.  That's okay with, you know, if you, if it's your party.  Right.  I can't be pissed off if she didn't invite me to your party.  But you know her for, I mean, no, I don't.  Here's the thing.  All black people don't know each other.  No, but you, you, all, no, no, no.  But you were the color purple together.  Yeah, but that was 21 years ago.  We don't hang up.  We don't, we don't hang out.  It's, you know, it's just, we're not, we're not, we're acquaintances. 
[03:03:00]  Very, very mild acquaintances.  So, no, it's not something that I'm part of with her and it's cool.  But wasn't her party for like very influential or powerful black women?  Wasn't that the theme of it?  Mm-hmm.  Well then, I mean, even if you're not close anymore, I mean, you certainly fit into that  list.  I mean.  Well, perhaps I do.  And when she gets around to her list and she changes it, I guess I'll get the invitation.  Will you go?  Um, I don't know.  Good, good.  That's good.  Sophie has no idea what she has started.  The pests are going to turn on us today as soon as she leaves. 
[03:03:30]  I know.  Now we're going to get the wrath.  You're kissing her ass.  We're going to get the wrath.  Oh, please.  What's up with you pests?  Yeah, exactly.  Pests get a life.  Be nice.  You've been mean to me.  Wait, wait.  No, I've got to talk to the pests.  I've got to talk to the hand.  Listen.  It's like Mongo.  Don't shoot them.  You'll just make them mad.  Don't do it.  Pests, you have been doing some mean stuff to me down around the building that I'm in.  There's no reason for y'all to walk up on me the way that you have.  Did they?  No reason at all. 
[03:04:00]  So, Pests, I don't mind.  I like the boys.  The boys, they're doing what they're doing.  But y'all don't have to scare, physically scare me.  There's no reason for it.  Don't physically scare.  Whoopi, I've been telling you guys for three days to knock this off and to just let other  people do their show.  They don't listen because they want to be in the paper and it's hurtful.  Jimmy.  Hey, Whoopi, could you thank us tomorrow?  Yeah, because we, for the last three days, we gave you a lot of attention in New York Radio.  And I think your thank you is in order. 
[03:04:30]  Didn't you hear me say good morning to y'all?  Because even negative publicity is good.  You know that.  No, it's not.  No, it's not.  Bad publicity is good.  That's what they told me when I read O&A Fired on the cover of the paper.  It's like, yeah, that's good.  Will you thank us tomorrow on your show?  I will.  I will.  Absolutely.  Can I give you all my best and tell you thanks for making it at least fun?  Absolutely.  And I'll see you.  Can I come back sometime?  Yeah.  You can absolutely come back.  Do you mind, though, a couple times if you hit on a subject, can we just kind of talk 
[03:05:00]  about it a little bit?  Please do.  If we're nice.  Please do.  No, and even if you're tearing it to shreds, it's cool.  It's cool.  Thanks for showing the rest of the country that we're a bunch of pussies.  We really are shit talkers anonymously.  We're just cowards.  We get behind the screen door with our mother and yell something and then hide.  I saw her coming toward the door and I just went.  That's what they want you to think, y'all out there.  Can we get a quick picture? 
[03:05:30]  They were happy to see me.  Absolutely.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We're taking a picture with our new friend.  Deal with it, shitheads.  And now, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This show sucks.  It's awful.  Nice.  Old school.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We got Mike from PalTalk. 
[03:06:00]  He has something for the program today.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to do an old thing.  Blast a hole in the wall with the AR-15.  Wait, you want to shoot your gun again?  Well, yeah.  Just do another hole in the wall with the AR-15.  Yeah, this was the guy that shot his gun in his apartment.  Didn't you, like, hit a pipe or something?  Yeah.  Well, I rent, so it doesn't matter.  What's your screen name? 
[03:06:30]  What's your screen name?  Yeah.  Well, this one that I got now is Guns For You.  Oh, yeah?  Can you act a little more excited?  Hello?  Oh, my God.  I think he's drunk.  Well, I got his camera up, and he is, wow.  He's holding a, hold on.  Oh, there it is.  This is an Olympic arms. 
[03:07:00]  This is an O&A special right here.  So, fuck you guys.  Now, wait a minute.  Come on.  Hold on.  No, this is an O&A.  Well, hold on.  Olympic arms.  What state do you live in?  Wisconsin.  Wisconsin.  And what's outside your house?  Oh, it's not Wisconsin.  It's Wisconsin.  What's outside your house for a mile around you?  SWAT team? 
[03:07:30]  Probably SWAT team is ready for me.  Sir, don't repeat my bombed joke.  What is outside your house?  What neighbors do you have?  He's going to shoot the camera.  He's putting his laser sight.  I will.  You fuckers.  You fucking with me.  No, I'm not fucking with you.  Oh, crap.  We would never fuck with a guy like you.  Dude, no private pile.  We're not fucking with you.  Don't you have mail to deliver?  Oh, no. 
[03:08:00]  Don't shoot your camera.  I don't know what he's doing.  Just make sure you don't shoot it where anybody is, please.  We haven't said anything.  We haven't said to shoot this thing.  Let's make that perfectly clear.  Yeah.  I don't like this guy.  He scares me.  You're scaring us.  Yeah, because I got kicked off of Pal Talk the last time because of you guys.  Why?  What happened, son?  No, because what I did when I fucking blasted a hole in the wall. 
[03:08:30]  I'm not going to do it right now.  No, because what the fuck?  Right.  No, I'm just saying.  What did you...  You know, as soon as I did that the last time, I took a hole in the wall.  And then, you know, yeah, I had leaky pipes and shit.  Right.  And then all of a sudden, yeah, I couldn't get on Pal Talk.  What are you drinking this afternoon, this morning?  Whatever.  You know, no, no. 
[03:09:00]  You know damn well what I'm talking about because I'm sure there's other people that, you know,  the same thing happened to them.  You sound angry.  Yeah, why are you angry, Mike?  Well, I'm not, like, a Stern fan, if that's what you're going for.  No, we don't think you're a Stern fan.  I'm just saying you sound like you're all worked up about something.  And you sound like you might be on drugs.  I'm not.  No, no.  I, you know, I love you guys. 
[03:09:30]  I just, I work nights, so, like, right now is, like, my prime time.  Right.  Oh, so you're partying a little bit.  Yeah.  Well, a little bit.  What are you drinking, beer?  Just regular light beer.  Light beer?  And it's what?  Like, you know, it's still pretty early in the morning.  You guys.  You guys.  You guys.  That's what you hear right before he shoots you.  You guys.  You guys.  What kind of work do you do, Mike?  You know?  Mike. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, I drive.  Okay.  I drive right now.  Cool.  He's holding the gun again.  And then, like, you know, I beat people for a living, so, you know, whatever.  Well, I'd rather, because you sound a little tipsy.  I'd rather you don't shoot when you're drunk.  Yeah.  Well, I kind of figured that.  Yeah.  So, the guy that I talked to earlier, so, he kind of, kind of, me that, he said that.  Maybe if you've got a range or somewhere that, you know, you're not going to shoot through 
[03:10:30]  a wall and hit the neighbor or something.  Maybe, you know, in that case.  But we really can't condone you firing off a weapon in your house of that caliber while  you're drunk and us not knowing what's outside those thin walls.  Can we get in trouble for that?  I would say yes.  You know, okay, you're going to hang up on me, right?  No, we're not.  No, we're just kind of...  No, no, no, no.  We did this already before, though.  It was like, you know, it was the same caliber, same...  Yeah, no, no, I understand. 
[03:11:00]  We did it before, and we got very lucky.  Here, pull...  Yeah, exactly.  Pull the magazine out of that thing.  Go ahead.  Pull the magazine out.  Yeah, nice.  He's got the gun again.  All right.  Hi, Joker.  Oh, whatever.  There he goes.  Pull the magazine out.  I wouldn't read what Pal Talk is saying about you, by the way.  All right.  Now, put that on the table.  Put that on the table.  Put that on the table in front of you.  Okay.  Now, pick up the weapon and eject...  Hey, which one? 
[03:11:30]  Do you have one?  No.  Oh, my God.  He's got more.  The other one.  You don't have one in the...  Oh, God.  You are loaded for bear.  You are loaded for bear.  Which one?  No, you don't have one chamber, do you?  Which one?  Dude.  You fucking fag.  Dude, you don't have one.  Dude.  Come on, you fuckers.  I got fucking four of them right here.  Hey, open the breach of the rifle.  Open it.  Why?  No, no, no.  Go ahead.  You guys are just...  Just open it. 
[03:12:00]  Don't be a faggot, Anthony.  Go ahead.  Open it up.  Oh, I'm not.  You guys are.  You don't even know what the fuck this is.  Open it up.  All right.  Now, keep it like that until you sober up, you fucking lunatic.  Fuckers.  This guy rocks.  Dude.  Come on.  Mike.  Come on.  That's all you got?  Mike, you rock.  I say you rock.  That's all you got?  That's all you got?  That's all you got?  I think you're gay.  No, no, no.  I was going to do something. 
[03:12:30]  You know what I'm saying?  All right, listen.  This is all I want to do.  This is...  Mike, listen to me.  It's Opie talking.  Whatever you do, do not read what they're writing about you on Pal Talk.  Do not.  I don't give a fuck what they're saying on Pal Talk.  I'll read it later when...  No, read it right now.  Read it live on the air.  What is your major malfunction, nuttouch?  I'm looking at you guys right now.  That's all I care about.  No, do us a favor, though.  I didn't wait on...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Mike, read what they're saying about you.  All right.  Just read some of the comments.  Yeah, there...  Yeah, I fucking... 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, I gave...  I don't give a fuck.  I don't care.  What do they say?  You know what?  I should have shot myself a long time ago.  I don't give a fuck.  Come on.  You fuckers, you fucking...  Yeah, you don't want to do it.  Come on.  You fucking...  Let's do the fucking AR-15 in the wall again.  Come on.  We did it once before.  Your days of finger-banging old Mary Jane's rotten crotch through her pretty pink panties  are over.  Come on.  We did it before.  Let's do it again. 
[03:13:30]  What are they writing about you?  Read some of the comments.  I don't care.  I'm not even reading it.  I'm...  You know, I've been waiting on lines.  Yeah, let's do the fucking AR-15 in the wall.  No, I don't...  You better not.  I don't know what's behind...  I don't know what's behind your wall.  You guys suck.  Yeah, we suck.  Come on.  Sir, the fact that we're peers...  No, I'm just kidding.  I don't...  I don't mean you guys suck.  I don't mean you suck.  You suck.  I don't mean...  No, no.  But come on now.  You're too drunk to be firing weapons, sir.  That's not... 
[03:14:00]  That's not safe.  Yeah, show us your weapons again.  I want to see what you got in the house.  What do you got in your house?  Let's see this.  I got a lot of shit.  Yeah, let's see what you got.  Well, any fucking time, sweetheart!  Holy crap.  Look at the...  Look at this.  He's waving that.  Do that one in the wall?  Oh, shit.  Come on.  Let's do the fucking 45 in the wall.  Oh, my God.  Can I do that?  No.  He's just holding up a 45.  Take your finger off the trigger of that...  Take your finger off the trigger.  Hold that thing safe.  Oh, my God. 
[03:14:30]  He's pointing a 45 at the camera, you lunatic.  Come on.  Let's fucking do it.  No, let's not do anything.  Come on, you don't want to do the Air 15?  Let's do the fucking 45.  No.  Oh, my God.  Put the 45 down.  All right, let's see what else...  Whatever.  He's all drunk, waving around at a 45.  Let's do some other ones in there.  All right, what else you got?  What else you got, Mike?  Oh, I got a lot of shit, dude.  Oh, my God.  This guy...  Got any grenades?  This guy's creeping me out.  I can't look away. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, my God.  I got a lot of stuff.  Dude, I got a walk-in fucking safe, though.  Yeah.  Anyway.  Dude, come on.  Or I will unscrew your head and check down your neck.  No, you can fucking play what you want.  You know, come on, man.  We fucking did the fucking Air 15 in a while.  Yeah, I know.  What do you want from us, Mike?  What do you want from us?  What do you want from us?  What the hell is people trying to fucking, like, tell-talk me here now? 
[03:15:30]  I don't want to do that.  Fucking go away.  No, seriously.  You know what the fuck?  Well, what do you want from us?  Never mind.  I don't want anything.  I just thought it'd make for good radio to do another hole in the wall with the Air 15.  That's all I wanted.  Yeah, but you're a little drunk this time around.  No, I'm not.  I'm not at all.  You sound, like, pretty fucked up.  Yeah, where's the other hole?  Where's the old hole?  Is it still around? 
[03:16:00]  You want to see it?  Yeah.  All right, Mike's moving his camera.  I remember this guy.  He did shoot a gun in his apartment.  It's right over there.  Where?  There it is.  I saw it.  Where?  Yeah.  There's two of them.  Right there over the...  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Right on to the right of the chair.  Yeah, and I put some fucking phone books there because I was going to do the one today.  But no, it doesn't seem like you guys want to fucking do that, so...  No, you sound a little... 
[03:16:30]  And then everybody's calling me a fucking pussy.  How close are your neighbors?  They're gone right now.  No, I don't care if they're gone.  How close is their house?  That's far.  All right, well...  I cannot sit here and...  You in a house or an apartment?  Oh, my God.  Fucking...  Doggo Doug fucking driving me crazy right now.  I got his address if you need it. 
[03:17:00]  Dude, seriously.  I was going to...  Never mind.  Then fuck it.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah.  You know what?  I...  Whatever.  Yeah, yeah.  Whatever.  That's fine.  Dude, being gay is not a big deal.  We don't care.  Yeah, whatever, dude.  Whatever.  Yeah.  All talk, no action.  What can I tell you?  You're crazy, man.  You fuckers.  I love you guys.  Dude, can you point a gun at the camera again?  I got a lot of fucking guns.  I got a lot of fucking guns.  Look at...  Look at that. 
[03:17:30]  It's so crazy.  Oh, my God.  Look at the size of that barrel.  Big 45.  Big 45.  That'll rip a big hole in you.  Just pointing at the screen.  Don't shoot.  No, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  Fucking 45.  Yeah.  All right.  He's just showing us his 45.  That's all.  Holy crap.  Yeah, I'm just showing us so you guys don't get in trouble.  Okay?  You know how awful that would be in real life?  I don't want you guys to get in trouble.  I don't want you guys to get in trouble.  Pointing at you.  Shit.  Horrifying.  That's my wife.  Just so you guys don't get in trouble. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  Fuckers.  What are you, fuckers?  What?  You're real...  This guy's hysterical.  You damn well would have talked about it, you fuckers.  Oh, yeah.  You say, oh, he's drunk.  What do you want from us, Mike?  No, I just want to do a fucking other...  So you want us to give the okays?  Go on the wall.  We're at a standstill here.  You want us to...  No, I know you can't.  You want us to give the old okay, right?  I know you can't do that now, okay?  I understand that, but... 
[03:18:30]  He's too drunk to be handling weapons.  Yeah.  Whatever.  And this isn't the...  I'm sure you have a city ordinance that says,  discharge of firearms prohibited within city limits.  I had to fix the fucking leak from the last time.  The fucking water, man.  Anyway.  You're fucked up, dude.  No, I'm not.  All right.  Okay, I am.  You sound like a jovial man.  Yeah.  I just like hearing him talk with that music from Full Metal Jack.  I know.  It's really creepy. 
[03:19:00]  It's really creepy.  Dude, and I was supposed to...  I was going to, like, fucking crank something up,  so I could blast this fucking round, but...  Yeah, let's see that.  Let's see the firepower again.  All right.  You sure?  Yeah, I just want to see.  All right.  Well, I'm going to, like...  I'm going to just crank up something real loud.  Don't shoot it.  Wait, what is he doing?  Don't shoot it, stupid.  No, I'm not going to shoot it.  Okay.  What is he cranking up?  He called me stupid.  He was cranking up the radio or the TV.  That was a remote control, Jimmy.  All right.  I thought it was a little gun.  Nice weapon identification. 
[03:19:30]  I'm far away.  He was holding a gun.  You make a great cop.  You want me to do it or not?  I'm holding a donut, and you shoot him.  I thought it was a roundy, round gun.  I don't know what he's doing.  Wow, you are definitely like Private Pile.  Now, don't shoot it, though, man.  Keep the magazine out.  Keep the magazine out.  Don't...  No.  Oh, no.  Don't pull that back.  Oh, shit.  He just chambered it around.  No, Mike.  No, no.  Mike, don't do it.  That thing is ready to go. 
[03:20:00]  No, no.  Oh, God, no.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  Jesus.  I'm not.  Don't do it.  What is he doing?  Holy fuck.  That was fucking loud.  What is he...  Knock it off.  Dude, you can't be shooting a weapon like that, man. 
[03:20:30]  Will you cut it out?  Oh, I was just kidding.  I was just kidding.  I was just kidding.  No.  I was just kidding.  I was just kidding.  I didn't fucking do anything.  You know, you have another round now in that chamber.  You're right.  Yeah.  Pull the fucking magazine out and clear that.  Clear the fucking weapon, you maniac.  He's got a laser sight on us now.  All right.  I did it.  All right. 
[03:21:00]  All right.  Empty.  Lunatic.  Everything.  No, it was just a joke.  It was just a joke shooting.  It was just a joke shooting.  Don't come on, right?  Oh, my God.  Laser sight's gone.  No, we're just kidding.  Right?  Yeah.  All right.  Look.  We got to go.  This is the next step for pests.  We arm them.  All right.  Well, you guys have a good day.  You too.  You too.  It's a little joke. 
[03:21:30]  Of course it is.  Cheers.  Yeah, there he is drinking.  Of course.  Just gave us a cheers.  All right.  Cheers again.  All right, man.  All right.  There you go.  Wow.  Great.  Yeah.  It's the day that the Post Report is here.  This is terrific.  Oh, you should have seen him run to the window and look when he heard that weapon discharge.  All right, Mike.  Bye, Mike.  Stay alive, all right?  Yeah.  Stop fucking around with the guns.  Stay alive, Mike.  There he goes.  Mike from Pal Talk.  Very, very creepy with that music playing. 
[03:22:00]  Drunk with weapons.  I think he's been drinking.  Unbelievable.  That was really creepy.  That's what, yeah.  A man's arms were pinned in machinery.  Amazingly, he managed to dial 911 on his cell phone with his toes.  The call came from inside DRS Technologies at 2 a.m. Thursday morning.  Help me.  Help me.  Okay, what are you stuck in?  What type of machinery?  I'm stuck in a beehive.  How are you calling me?  I'm dialing with my rear claws, and I just shit on my phone. 
[03:22:30]  With his arms pinned, he was able to tell Cruz how to find him.  I'm really queer.  I'm really queer.  Do you hear him?  I mean, I'm over here.  It's amazing.  He's a lucky man.  And that's how you dial a phone with your feet.  This concludes the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Listen live from 6 a.m. to noon, Monday through Friday, with replays throughout the day.  Want more?
